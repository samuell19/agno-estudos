Tell me. The hearing of your case is at 10 a.m. Didn't you start yet? Hang over? Just now had a hang over peg. Are you coming to court, drunk? Some people come to the temple, drunk. Don't worry. The drunkard will always speak the truth. For ten years, this divorce case was in proceedings. You haven't revealed the reason for filing the divorce. It's okay, if you don't tell the reason to the court. But, atleast are you aware of the problem between you? If you had filed by mutual consent, You would've got divorce in a year. But, Mrs. Gowri, you ask for divorce. Mr.Raja, you're prolonging for ten years without giving her the divorce. You are not living together too. If asked, you say that you'll miss your daughter. Her future... something you're saying. It's you, who is spoiling her future. Your daughter has got a place in University of Toronto, Canada. Sign language linguistics and speech language pathology, She has got scholarship to do graduation in both the courses. She must join within two weeks of getting the visa. Her uncle's residence is there. She is going to stay along with her mother there. What's your problem in this? Her future and career... Aren't these foremost? Foremost only, madam. Before my daughter leaves, I wish that she ought to... ... spend just ten days with me. Mrs.Gowri, do you agree for this? No. Not necessary, madam. Madam, when the court said we can live apart, She was seven years old, then. That too daughter. So, she must stay with her mother. You said, she can stay with her father for one day in a month. If so, a day in a month... twelve days in a year... In ten years, only for one hundred and twenty days... ...my daughter stayed with me. In ten years, it's four months. Only four months, my daughter stayed with me. Every month, just for one day, She'll come to my home. When coming so, at one time, She was different. She felt shy. By her behaviour, I knew that she attained puberty. After all, I'm her father! I'll sign the divorce papers. Let my daughter go abroad for her studies. After the completion of the formalities in these two days, My daughter should stay with me for at least ten days. I missed my daughter for ten years. Madam, so for ten days, I must live with her as "dad - daughter". If it's acceptable, I'll agree to sign the divorce papers and to go abroad. Mrs. Gowri, The divorce case hasn't get over. As per child custody law, if he doesn't agree, You can't take her to abroad. Decide about it. The court will meet after lunch. You haven't revealed the reason yet for filing the divorce. It's okay, if you don't tell the court. But, at least are you aware of the problem between you? Not much difference in the scan. Any difference in the symptoms? Many... Earlier, he slept for two, three days... Now, he sleeps for two, three weeks... Earlier, it came once in two or three years. Now, it comes twice or thrice in a year. Why? Sometimes, it comes twice in a month. First, you must understand the problem. The sleeping nature of your husband is a disease. A rare neurological condition. It's called, "Kleine-Levin syndrome". It's also called as "sleeping beauty syndrome". In 750 crores of world's population, Only thousand people suffer by this syndrome. Don't know why it comes. No medication also. Generally, a person can sleep for eight hours a day. But, these people will sleep for eight days, even for eight weeks. In California, a girl has slept for eight months. Those who are affected may wake up after days, weeks, months, even years. But, it doesn't mean that they sleep ever. When normal, they wake up and go to bed like other people. But, when they get these kind of attacks... ...like heart attack and asthma attack. You can call this as "sleep attack". When they get these kind of attacks, We cannot determine when they'll wake up, It's known that a person will not do any fault in his sleep. But, what is your problem when he is sleeping? Why can't you understand his problems? You only can't understand my problem. You said casually, what's my problem with his sleep? When my daughter was two years old, He was driving the car. I was playing with my daughter. Suddenly, the car lost control. When I checked on him, he was asleep. Then, I took control of the wheels… ... got hit. And we survived with minor injuries. If missed, we would've been dead. Then, the other day, he took the baby for a shower... ...and he didn't return for hours. When I checked on him, He was asleep in the bathroom. The baby was screaming in the bathtub filled with water. Oh, no...hey...! What if she had drowned in the bathtub? An another incident happened during Diwali. Everybody was bursting crackers along with the family in front of their houses. Even myself and my daughter were bursting crackers. Don't get scared. -be careful. Dad is with you. -Dad, I'm afraid. The sparks might fall on the dress. Suddenly, she ran into the house. When I checked on her, Dad, please get up. Dad please come. Dad please dad. Everyone is bursting crackers, dad. You too join us. But, he was asleep not aware that day was Diwali. Wear new dress, dad. Everyone's dad are bursting crackers. You too come dad. How would I've felt seeing that? While everyone is awake, he falls asleep. But, when everybody falls asleep, I'm awake. I can understand what you're thinking of. But, I'm not implying that. A husband is not only a physical companion for a woman... ...but also an emotional companion. I wonder, whether you can understand, Even if you're a doctor, you're also a male. Mrs.Gowri, do you agree for your daughter staying with him for ten days. Yes, madam. I'm taking care of my daughter safely since ten years. Please, take care of her safely for ten days.... "Deaf and Dumb school" In a forest, a pregnant deer was grazing around with it's herd. Suddenly, the labour pain became intense and she gave birth to a fawn. Four lions encircled the deer herd. All the deers flee away. The mother deer, for the sake of the other fawns of her... ...left the new born and flee away. The four lions encircled the fawn. That fawn isn't aware that it is encircled by four lions... ...and started playing with them. Even, the four lions were playing with the fawn, thinking anyway they're going to kill it. And the deer played happily, without realising, it's going to be their prey. Thanks, dad. Mom informed me that you've given consent for my abroad studies... ...and I'll be staying with you for ten days. Superb! Cheery!! Why didn't you tell me that you're so interested to go abroad for studies? It's not only studies, but a great service. But, I'm supposed to learn the course there. Sir, good morning. Tell me. Visa has arrived. I'll bring her today evening. -Mom, I'm going to take bath. On 10th of evening, I'll take her back. Why it's on 10th? The flight is on 11th, isn't it? On 10th is her birthday. We must celebrate. Why? Won't we celebrate? The flight is on 11th at 12'o clock. She'll be in the airport at 9 a.m. I can't believe your timing. Leave her at 8 a.m. Okay, on 11th, exactly at 8 a.m, she'll be at the airport. It's good, you help me to solve the case in office. But, you also say that you'll help me to clean up the house. Sir, you don't have anyone to help in cleaning up the house. You're staying alone. Your daughter is coming. - for that? Who'll help you other than us? It seems someone had moved. -sir. See here. That side. Take it. Take it. Hurry up. You've botched it. He was waiting outside on the bike. Hey, who knows that he'll come at mid-day instead of mid-night? No problem at all now. There is no CCTV camera either in the house or on the road. I brought the purse and the wrist watch. They might've thought me as thief. Hey, he is a police. The one who finds the crimes outside... ...can't he find out the same inside of his house? We have just ten days. If anything goes wrong, I'll kill you people. Definitely, he is a thief. He took away the watch and the purse. Even the bike number is fake. It's better to file a complaint in the nearby police station. Leave that, sir. You're habitual of drinking alcohol for ten years. How will you cut off for ten days? If it's for daughter, I have to stop everything. It's a comfort feel. Sir, except the empty bottle for decoration, there is no alcohol stuff in the house. Now the house is clean. Thank you, Mani. Daddy! Hey! Mom? She dropped me and left. The house looks anew. It's for you. Then, your things aren't seen. That's also for you. Holiday for ten days. Dad is fasting. Can you? It's tough only. I'll manage, leave it. You're going to stay with dad. Whatever you want to taste, Wherever you want to go, Whatever you want to see, Tell me everything. No restrictions. Enjoy yourself. Sure? -sure. Shall we go to the pub? Yes, daddy. I have never been to the pub. My friends called me. But, I'm not interested to go along with them. But, I wish to see how it will be? Shall we go? Yes, we'll go. Welcome, mam. Welcome, sir. I want an orange juice. What do you want? What other juice is here? You've lot of choices. You've a look at it and order. I'll go to restroom. What is this? -brandy, sir. Instead of giving juice for her, you kept brandy. She only ordered for it, sir. Daddy, I only ordered. Sorry. Do you drink? No, daddy. I ordered for you. For me? It's okay, dear. It's okay, daddy. No, I don't want. It's okay. Are you okay with it? Shall I take? Waiter, extra three large. Why, daddy? I must order now itself. Else, they'll bring late. They all drink to pass the time. But, I drink to kill the time. Superb! Daddy, Shall we dance? Superb dance! Daddy, do you know why I asked you to take drinks? Whether deliberately or not, you've become habitual of drinks. It's different, if you decide on your own and quit permanently. Instead, for my sake, you mustn't quit forcefully. You told me to enjoy whole heartedly for ten days with no restrictions. Telling me not to restrict, Why you must restrict yourself? You told me to rejoice, then why you must leave your rejoicement? That's why I told you to take drinks. "Lord! My Lord! You grant the child as a boon" "In the cells...within the cells... you're drawing an amazing poetry" "You're my daughter" "You're my life" "You're the penance I did" "Like the moisture in the stone, the father's affection delves in deep like an invisible root" "It's a bliss...it's a bliss..."

You know about mom. Don't care, daddy. I don't know when you both have become like this. But, after completing my studies, when myself and mom come back... ...I'm damn sure you both will be together. In my childhood, I remember, I slept in midst of you both... ...with my legs on you both. Then, I met you once in a month. Ten years passed away. Today is the only day. I'll leave tomorrow.

I'm a model. Basically from Bangalore. As I get offers, I stay here individually in a rented flat. A month before, I participated in the ramp walk for a product launch. On that night, I got an anonymous call. They spoke indecently. I scolded and disconnected the call. But, the same guy called me routinely from different numbers. And he said, "I always think of you from the day, I saw you in the ramp walk". "Myself and my friends need you". "I'll pay you no matter how much you ask for". He tortured me. I spoke normally. Even scolded him but he didn't heed. I have changed my contact numbers thrice. But, he traced out that number within a day and called again. Earlier, they spoke casually. Now, they say that I'll be paid if I admit. If I create any fuss, they threaten to abduct me. You could've informed the police. "We'll clinch the deal, till you don't approach the police". "We'll be watching you". "When we know that you approached the police, We'll abduct you on that day itself". Even when I am talking with you, I feel like someone is watching, sir. Today is my birthday. I don't have a mindset to go to temple also. I'm afraid, sir. Aadhira, cool down. Then, you said you've all the numbers. Message me all those. I'll ask to track that. To the core, don't go alone anywhere at night. right? You said, today is your birthday. Here is my gift. -sir! Sir, no. It's okay, take it. No, sir. -take it. Next week is my daughter's birthday. I bought it for her. You're also like my daughter. Please take it. Thank you, sir. Will you use it? Hello, -Sir, I'm Aadhira. Tell me. Sir, post meeting at Taj hotel, in the evening, I went to take my car in parking lot. They've put up a handkerchief from behind. I'm not aware of anything after that. After I woke up, I knew it's the car boot. They're abducting me somewhere. Please, save me. Don't hang up the call. Keep talking. Stay connected. -okay, sir. Do you know what vehicle is it? I don't know anything, sir. Just follow, what I say. Don't do any other thing. -okay, sir. Sir, the car has halted. Don't be panic. Don't hang up the call. Hide the phone. Hey... Open. Hey, -hello sir. Where are you? They've abducted me, sir. Where are they now? Hey. I locked the door, sir. They're breaking it. Is it upper floor? -yes. What kind of dress are you wearing? What things are there in the room? Follow carefully, what I say. Damn it. Hello. Hello. No. To me? Suppress! Leave me. Leave me. She dares to escape... Hey, take the hand. Hey, I'm the next. Hey, leave me. Hey... Hey, go and check who is that? Leave me. Leave me. Leave me. We've seen many girls. It's not new to us. Unnecessarily, you're barging in and creating issue. Am I creating issue? You've abducted a girl against her wish. Isn't that wrong? You show off your attitude that you can do anything... ...as you belong to rich family. Sir, are you going to file a case on us… …as we had abducted her? We'll prove that she is a slut. Why do you invoke that girl unnecessarily in this case? Is it a different case? In whatever category, you file a case, We'll be relieved of that case in a day. If you stand head over heels also, There is a case which you can't come out for atleast a year. Do you know that? Okay, i'll tell you. All these guys are from rich families. We've seized over twenty kilograms of brown sugar here. They've supplied all these to the college students... ...and made them addicted. As we were near, we encircled them as soon as we got a tip-off. We've informed to the narcotics department. We have attacked them for self-defense. Nothing happened. We're going to hand over them. That's all. Sir, who are they? Who are their parents? Sir, have you informed their parents? When will you produce them in the court? Sir, tell us. Daddy, he is Akshay. A very good guy. I think friends have arrived. Just a minute. I introduced myself to your daughter in Facebook. And tracked her by chatting in WhatsApp, Everything just for you! After one year of imprisonment, I came out... ... and roamed behind your daughter for a year without any other job, Just for this day! The pain we undergone for a year, in the prison... ...you're going to undergo that pain in this night. It's a fault, if we abduct a girl against her wish. Now, your daughter likes me. You filed a fake case on four of us, to save some unknown girl. Save your daughter from four of us, today. if you can! Daddy, these are Akshay's friends. So, they're my friends too. They'll take utmost care on me. The pain we underwent in the prison for a year... ..you're going to undergo that in this night. Tell me. Hey, hang up the phone. Ask the team to come. -okay, sir. Hello, Hello, Without watching the entire video, you've come here. Hello, who are you? Listen to me carefully. If you don't watch the video till the end, then you don't know what's in that? Hello. Your daughter is in the video, but not in the home. You doesn't know whether she is alive now or not. If she is alive, because of your foolish act, There are chances of her not being alive. If you don't go home immediately... The management is not responsible, for the loss. Hello... Sir, why did you call us? No, nothing. A simple matter. I thought of discussing. Nothing important. We'll talk tomorrow morning. -okay, sir. Sorry. -okay, sir. Good night, sir. He asked us to come. But, left without saying anything. Will there be any problem? -unable to understand anything. They'll take utmost care on me. -yes. Just like you! Hello. Hello. You forwarded it, right? You would've done. You can't wait for a minute till the countdown gets over. One year in prison, another one year behind your daughter. We were waiting for this day for two years. Then, an important order. You shouldn't touch the TV remote. Stop, freeze, forward... you shouldn't do anything. You must watch the entire video. Because, you don't know what will happen next in this video. You don't know what'll happen at the end. Then, if you try your police intelligence to save your daughter, Then, it's not "effort is the mother of good fortune". It'll be a bad fortune! You filed a narcotics case on us stating, we made the students addicted. Have you seen your daughter induced by drugs? You'll see today. Do you know the name of it? Magic mushroom. If taken, it's more effective than weed. If she takes one, the effect will be high. If taken two, the effect will be deadly. If she takes three, she won't be aware of what's happening around her. Will you see the magic spell of this magic mushroom? Dude, I have a rare item for you all. What's that? Magic Mushroom. If we take this, a magic spell happens in our body. It will be like floating. I want... I want, dude. Hey, I say it's a rare piece. But, everyone is simply asking. Let's do one thing. We'll play a game. I'll give a maximum of three. What game? -superb, we'll play. Very simple. Sha-bhu-three! -Okay. -okay. Sha-bhu-three! I'm the winner. My birthday gift for Kirthi. -thank you. Happy birthday! Sha-bhu-three! Hey, it's you. Birthday is for you. -see him. Happy birthday! Sha-bhu-three! How is it? Will you alone give her birthday gift? Won't I? -give it. My birthday gift for Kirthi. I am feeling uneasy. She has taken three. She doesn't know what will happen after this. But, you'll know. As you're going to watch it. Sir's way of behaviour seems to be abnormal, isn't it? He was drunk heavily. Not that, without any problem, Why should he call us? Sir, the stuff is over. We'll get from sir's table. Sir... Ravi, it's okay, let's tell him tomorrow. Mani. -sir. Get the bottle from sir's table, if any. -okay, sir. On seeing this, it's evident that he was highly restless. Not that much clear too, right? Sir, it doesn't look like a hint. Happy birthday! Happy birthday! Take it, dude. Happy birthday! We smeared a little. But, you... Hold her. Hey, she is running. Hey, catch her. Catch her, dude. Hold her, dude. Why did you smear like this? You did, right? It's okay. Take bath. You must also take bath. Go ahead, I'll come. Your daughter is calling me to bathe. Shall I go? She isn't aware of what she's doing. Hey, give me the camera. Hello. Sir, Tell me, sir. Nothing, I'll call you later. Hey, dude. Go inside. Just wait. Just wait. She needs to remove her dress. Then, when I enter, the display will be perfect. Now, she'll finish bathing. Just wait. Hey, you... -hello. Where are you? You... Hello. Hello. Hey, tell me. Don't get tensed. Already I instructed you not to forward, freeze and stop. You aren't listening. Now, you made a call. To whom? To police? Hello. What you watch is the recorded video. But, we're watching you "Live". And listening too. Every corner of your house is fitted with the camera and mic. I'll disconnect the call and ring up later. You are a police, right? Try to find out what's there and where they're? Good, you have found out. You would've understood now, how close we're watching you. Listen to me patiently. Your daughter is unstable. If anything ought to happen, it would've happened long before. As I said earlier, you'll undergo the pain this night which we suffered for a year. Just now it begun. Still many sorts of torture is awaiting you. If you don't listen to me, if you don't watch this video fully, Then, you can't see your daughter on the whole. Hey. We're spying on you, whether you watch this entire video. Better, watch that video from where you paused. Enjoy the show. You came to the office. But, you left without conveying anything. When called, then also you didn't say anything. That's why, came to meet you. You opened the door immediately. Didn't you sleep, sir? I was drinking. Shall I get a peg, sir. Sir, why are you still drinking? Are you upset about your daughter going abroad? Where is she? sleeping upstairs? Be seated. Sir, I'll leave. Good night, sir. The police came and left. Now, what you do... Without closing your eyes, you must watch the entire video. How was the tension? You're tensed just for this? We're yet to start the main game. We know well. Anyway, we'll get caught. Is there need of any other evidence than this video? But, we aren't concerned about that. You tried to teach us a lesson by imprisoning... So, you must be taught a lesson by us. That's our intention. You must know that you'll be electrocuted, When you come in contact with electricity. Because of you, the electrocution is passed to your daughter. Shall we begin the main game? Hey, The mushroom you gave was superb. Will you give me one more? Please. If I give you the mushroom, what'll you give me in return? What to be given? A Kiss. Not like this. Then, how? Hey, What happened? I asked you for mushroom. What are you doing? You want mushroom, right? Jerald sir, Where are you? I'm still on the road near sir's house. If you stay there, that might be a problem to him. Move on. Okay, sir. Hey, dude. Didn't you bathe? She took bath. That's enough. Hey, dude. Do you have the pack? I have. For us? I have four packets, count of 12. Isn't it enough? -Superb, dude. That's enough. Dude, a doubt. What, if that's not enough? She'll die. Dude, it's okay, you go first. It's ever the same. Superb, dude. Then what, the bottle itself pointed at you. You have to do the puja at first. Leave, dude. Okay, I'll leave. Decide who is the next? I'm going. Will you watch? No, it won't be good. Dude, she is very young. Don't show up your heroic adventures. Behave carefully. -hey. Is it only for me? Don't you behave carefully? -everyone will be careful, together. Hey, dude. Have you done? He has come. -enjoyed. Hey... Hey... Come on...come on... It's awesome. My dear... My dear... He has come. -come on, dude. It's of next level. Dude, he had rocked. Dear! Dear! Dear! Dear! Dear! Hello. Hello. Do you wish to see your daughter? Come. You didn't expect this twist, isn't it? You don't understand how she came in, right? When your daughter was taking bath. But, you would've understood why she came inside? She is the starting point, right? How it's possible without her? What happened to her, will happen to your daughter next. Why he has sent to different mobiles instead of one? He would've sent the numbers purposely to different mobiles, to see them separately. 7582 16, will that be case file? 7582 space 16. Right, it's 2016. Mani -sir. Look for the case file 7582 of the year 2016. Okay, sir. Upon tracking his call list, It's clear that all the calls are internet calls. All calls are enrouted through Russia. So, we can't trace out the incoming calls. What? Are you tensed as the video was off? Take the remote and change to AV2. Click the Live TV link in that. You watched us playing so far. Now, we both will play together. Because, so far the video you watched was recorded. That's happened. Now, what you're going to watch is "Live". This is happening.

Not only that, they're monitoring sir through the camera. Even, they've locked that girl somewhere. We don't have phone number… …or any hint to trace these four guys. If so, he would've conveyed that to us first. Even the internet calls are made through hotspot... ...instead of mobile and broadband. Sir's daughter and that four guys... ...mobile numbers must be traced out, Immediately, we must find out who their family members are... ...and their whereabouts too. Sure, sir. Hello, Has my mother-in-law left? I didn't let you to get caught by her. I'm not that bad. Okay, shall we start our job? You weren't able to find us, when we sneaked into your house.

But, receiving area cell tower indicates the location of sir's house. He got a call from the criminal, who slit his neck at evening. Upon inquiring, it's revealed that he was given five lakh rupees... ...and was asked to act like slitting the neck. He wasn't aware of anything else. Among the four, one of the guy's parents are settled in abroad, Another guy's father is in Delhi. The other guy's parents reside in Bangalore. One of those guy's father is in pub right now.

They would've tried my number, it might not be reachable. I must go, please. Hey, tell him. Dude... Okay, go. Don't switch on the phone here. Switch on after reaching the hospital and seeing your father. Dad! Accident case. -ICU first floor, sir. Did he tell anything? Sir told to create a fake news and flash it in TV... ...as that guy's father met with an accident. It's sir. He told to come home as a back up with jammer. Hey, hurry up. Come. Come fast. CCTV camera is fixed everywhere in the house. They're watching my activities through that camera. We must leave from here as soon as possible. Come, quick. -okay, sir. What's this? Sir, it's a mini wireless video transmitter and receiver. It'll cover upto hundred kilometres of radius. You mean, hundred kilometres? -yes, sir. Sara, Cover twenty seconds footage in the mobile... ...in the same angle of coverage as CCTV. Be quick. Okay, sir. -come...come... Fast. The maximum time difference is only two hours... ...after they left from home and for "Live Relay". If we count upon city traffic, Upto Minjur at North, Gudavanchery at South, Annanur at West and Thiruvidanthai at East. They can't go beyond this. So, we have to search at the maximum radius of sixty kilometres. He is not revealing anything though he has been hit hard. Did you traced out the phone number of that modelling girl? It's switched off, sir. GPS watch? Not working, sir. Hey...hey... Hey... Hey, why do you hold me? Leave me. Hey...hey... Pravin! Hey...hey... What've you done to my son? Do you know who I am?

What we're watching is a recorded video. The CCTV camera is disconnected and connected to the laptop. Shit. He has shown his police intelligence! Hey... Call Pravin from internet. Shit... They've trapped smartly. We have wasted more time, to make him tensed. Now, they've made us tensed. Definitely, they must be coming in search of us. I must finish her before that. You be ready.

Catch her, dude. Take her away, dude. Leave her. Leave her. Leave her. Leave. Pull her. What happened? Sir, this door is not opening. Move. Don't be tensed, sir. If anything had happened, they would've left your daughter and escaped. Sir, internet was active till ten minutes before. Knowing that we'll trace them, they wantedly left the laptop and hotspot. Sir, definitely they wouldn't have gone far. They must be in the surroundings. We can catch them, if we go. Has the cops been alerted in these left and right routes? Yes, sir. All the vehicles are stopped with barricades and checking. They can't escape. We would've been informed if they were caught. In the map, it shows a mud road to the forest. Go in that way. Torch. Yes, sir. Nothing... nothing.. Sir, Save that girl. Sir, Save that girl. Sara, Be with this girl for safety. -yes, sir. Yes, sir. Jerald, she might be attacked from outside. You too be with them, outside. -okay sir. Drop it. Drop it. Move. Daddy. Boys, what to do? Kill them, sir! Please, sir You spoke throughout the night. I was listening. Now, I'll speak. Abducting you from the hospital, Abducting your father from the bar, No evidence for these incidents. It's not the police department's gun used to shoot your father. To be frank, it's not the police which shot him. I took this decision after consulting the Minister and the Commissioner. In India, 400 people are reported missing every day. In today's count, four of you will be there. After you go missing, Your parents will be searching you. Similarly, the police department will also be searching you. But, you won't be found. Because, you are going to be buried in this earth. After hundreds of years, if the archeological department digs... ...for anything, may be they'll find then. When you were imprisoned earlier, you came out free. Now... Has the vehicle arrived? -yes, sir. Get them both to the hospital. -okay, sir. I informed the doctor. Ensure that the matter doesn't leak out. Okay, sir. -right? Okay, sir. - go... Jerald, -sir. The vehicle in which we brought the guy from the hospital... ...and the vehicle we saw at night, -okay sir. Take both that vehicles to Chinthadripet. -yes, sir. Dismantle thoroughly, even the nuts and the bolts. No one must know. -yes, sir. Go...go... -thank you, sir. Go. Jerald, -sir. Then, "This is a forest area" -yes sir. "Comes under the control of the forest department" Right, sir. "Tresspassers will be prosecuted." Caution by the police department. Write a signboard, tie a ribbon and seal everything. Okay, sir. I don't know whether a thanks is enough for your help. But, until I'm alive, I'll never forget you. Sometimes, in our life, many disgusting incidents will happen. If we keep them in mind, the entire life will become a hell. In your life's calendar, think there was no yesterday. Then, to anyone or for anything, you must not share this matter. Because, in our society only the victims are still victimised. Okay? You must not share anything with your mom, okay? Hello, You said that you'll leave her exactly at 8 a.m. Now, the time is 8.10. She'll be there exactly at 9. I know your timing... If the flight is missed... Okay, your things is in the vehicle. We'll go straight away to the airport. Okay? -okay. Okay. Come. There is an age for everything. Likewise, there is an age and maturity to fall in love. To fall in love is not a fault. You must not fall in love with a wrong person. Similarly, even in WhatsApp, Facebook, internet and computer... ...in everything there are good things. But, more than that, there are chances of learning bad things too.
