He steps on the floor Without making a sound And then he starts feeling the beat You would think the floor was greased By the way he's moving his feet He's a champion, he's the best Impossible to tame Go back! Stay! Stay! Don't follow me to school. Stay! Stay! Some kids have dogs that follow them to school. I think it's a head, ma'am. Shall I throw it in the wastebasket? Maybe you'd like to see it up close? I can take it up to your desk, ma'am. It's pretty heavy. It feels like it's full of lead. There you are, ma'am. Now you can get a close look at it. You missed it, sir. We've been studying the human head. Somehow I feel I should get you for something, Marcie. But I don't know what. Put away that history book, Marcie. Art is next. I love art class. How's this, ma'am? Twenty-four cows standing in a pasture, each one rendered in exquisite detail. Maybe I'll add some sheep and rabbits and squirrels. A gorgeous pastoral setting. Now I'll color the sky blue and the grass green. And I'll put in some yellow flowers. Wow. What a picture! What an artistic triumph. Marcie, you haven't drawn a thing! Some of us are just patrons of the arts, sir. What did you put down for the fourth question? Six times 12 is 72. Seventy-two? I put down green. Green? Why did you put down green? I thought it was a trick question. Marcie, this is hard work. Boy, I sure could use a little break right now. Sorry, ma'am. My nose is caught in my binder. I'm trying not to scream. It's very painful. May I have permission to see the school nurse? Or maybe the custodian? We may need a pair of pliers. Sorry, ma'am. I'm having trouble seeing where I'm going. Ouch! My report? I'm sorry, ma'am. It's in my binder, and my binder's caught in my hair. I've tried whipping it backward and forward. But nothing seems to help. Anyway, my report was called: "Does education have to be painful?" I think maybe it does. No, ma'am. I really can't take it off because-- Yikes! Because my hair is still caught in the binder. Yikes! She got it off. Marcie got it off. What a relief. My report? It's right here in my binder. Don't sigh like that, ma'am. It breaks my heart. Gym is my favorite class. I'm so dumb I wish all classes were gym. I sure look forward to gym. You know, Chuck? I may not be as cute as that little red-haired girl, and I may not have naturally curly hair like Frieda, and I may not be as smart as Lucy, but I've got one thing none of them has. I'm in shape!

Lift those legs. Lift them higher. Oh, good grief. Are you ready for the party tonight, Sally? I remember the last time I went to a party. Linus called up and asked me if I would like to go to a party. And I said, "Yes." And then when we got there, Linus asked me if I would like to dance. And I said, "Yes." Then after we danced, Linus said, "Would you like a glass of punch?" And I said, "Yes. That would be very nice. I would like to have a glass of punch." I don't believe that ever happened. Well, it should have! Okay, gang, we're gonna play Simon Says. I'll start it. Simon says, "Raise your arms." Simon says, "Turn around." Simon says, "Clap your hands." Simon says-- Okay, it's my turn now.

I'll have a cup, please. I'm glad to see you're not only having a good time, but you're also helping out with the party. I'll have a cup of punch, please. You know, Charlie Brown, you have to do something about your face. It's impossible to talk to someone when they're making such sour faces. Okay, everybody, gather 'round It's time for the Pigpen Hoedown Kick up your heels, jump up and down Shut your eyes and whirl around Reach out your hand And if no one's there Grab your own hand Dance 'round in a square When you're doing the Pigpen Hoedown Gotta have a caller you can trust 'Cause when Pigpen does a hoedown He really kicks up some dust Hey, Chuck, we're all bumping into each other. Let me give it a try. Bow to your left, bow to your right And if you find no one in sight Just bow to your toes And bow to your knees And dance around just as you please When you're doing the Pigpen Hoedown Gotta have a caller you can trust 'Cause when Pigpen does a hoedown He really kicks up some dust -I can hardly see. -It's getting worse. Hey, Patty, we're still bumping into each other. Let me be the caller. We don't need a caller, Lucy. We need a vacuum cleaner. If we really wanna dance And we stay here we got no chance So nod to the ceiling And bow to the floor Leave Pigpen here And head for the door When you're doing the Pigpen Hoedown Gotta have a caller you can trust 'Cause when Pigpen does a hoedown He really kicks up some dust Do you realize what you're becoming? I don't know what you're becoming, but I do know what you're not becoming. You don't do any of the things that a dog is supposed to do. You don't bark at strangers. You don't bring in the morning paper. You don't even bring me my slippers at night. In the old days, dogs used to round up sheep and guard them in case wolves attacked. I never see you rounding up sheep. I'll bet you don't even know what one looks like. You don't try to follow me to school, and you don't meet me when I come home. There's nothing worse than owning a dog who isn't a dog. Who can fly a doghouse Up in the bright blue sky? It's Snoopy, it's got to be him Who can wind up his ears Lift up his head and fly? It's not a Rover, not a Fido No, no, not him It's not a Lassie, not a Benji Not Rin Tin Tin Well, it's Snoopy Who's in the bathroom? Open up. He can do anything Snoopy makes everyone smile Who doesn't need a glove To be the best shortstop around? It's Snoopy, it's got to be him Who can put on his shades And be the coolest dog in town? It's not a Rover, not a Fido No, no, not him It's not a Lassie, not a Benji Not Rin Tin Tin Well, it's Snoopy, Snoopy -Talkin' 'bout Snoopy -Talkin' 'bout Snoopy He can do anything Snoopy makes everyone smile He steps on the floor Without making a sound Then he starts feeling the beat You would think the floor was greased By the way he's moving his feet He's a champion, he's the best Impossible to tame People say that he's obsessed Listen to the sound of his name They call him Flash, Flash Flash, Flash, Flashbeagle When he moves around The whole room starts to reel You know he's Flash, Flash Flash, Flash, Flashbeagle When he jumps up high He glides like a wild eagle Lightning flashes when he leaps up He's got everybody shouting for more Thunder crashes When he hits the ground He's burnin' up the dancin' floor He's a champion, he's the best Impossible to tame People say that he's obsessed Listen to the sound of his name They call him Flash, Flash Flash, Flash, Flashbeagle When he moves around The whole room starts to reel You know he's Flash, Flash Flash, Flash, Flashbeagle When he jumps up high He glides like a wild eagle Flashbeagle? I can't stand it. I need something for show-and-tell. I pick you because you're a first-round draft pick. Yes, sir. You're going to get me an "A" for show-and-tell. A real, live dog. For show-and-tell, I brought my pet chameleon. His name is George. And George changes colors with every shirt I wear. George eats flies and bugs. Thank you. Yes, ma'am. Heel, Snoopy. For show-and-tell today, I have brought a dog. What's so great about that? He doesn't do anything. He just stands there. He looks like he's asleep. A dog is not only man's best friend, but he's also a protector, a defender, a ferocious friend in need-- indeed. From the fur on his feet To the tip of his nose He's got rhythm Pumping all through his veins Oh, he spins like a top That'll never stop With the power of a hurricane He's a champion, he's the best Impossible to tame People say that he's obsessed Listen to the sound of his name They call him Flash, Flash Flash, Flash, Flashbeagle When he moves around The whole room starts to reel You know he's Flash, Flash Flash, Flash, Flashbeagle When he jumps up high He glides like a wild eagle A wild eagle I don't know what to do about Snoopy. I should give him a good lecture, the way he carries on. You just leave him alone. That's the first time I ever got an "A" in show-and-tell.
