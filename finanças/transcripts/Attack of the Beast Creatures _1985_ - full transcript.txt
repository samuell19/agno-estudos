- Help! Help! - There's a woman out there! - We're drifting. We're drifting away from the other life boats! - Well? - Well, somebody do something! You! You're part of the crew! - Hey, sit down! - Well, look where we're going. - Do you think we're caught in a current? - We must be. There's no reason to get alarmed though. - But I get this feeling we're drifting faster than the current. - Mr. Morgan. Mr. Morgan. Mr. Morgan, wake up. It's your turn to... It's your turn to stand watch. Here. I didn't see any ships, maybe you'll have better luck. - Quinn! - Where do you think we are, John? - Your guess is as good as mine. Greenland, maybe. No... Let's not worry about that now. We need water. - Mr. Bruin! Mr. Bruin! Oh my God! He's dead! He's dead! - He's still alive, give me the canteen. - Hey, wait a minute! That's the last of our water! We need it! - Mrs. Gordon, would you please take Cathy up there away from the boat? - Surely. Come on, dear. Come with us, Diane. - We'll have to carry him to a spot to make him comfortable, then we'll go find more water. - I'll be up with the girls when you're ready. - You! Aren't you going to help us? - You're wasting your time. The man's as good as dead. We've got to look out for ourselves. - That guy's got a lot of nerve. I'd like to- - Forget him! Let's get this man comfortable! - Cheer up. - I'm sorry, it's just all that blood. - I know. But, you know, he's going to be all right. They're looking after him, and he's going to be all right. - Yeah, he's gonna be fine. - Think about something pleasant. - Think about- - Yeah. - Home. We'll all be home soon. Is he all right? - Ah, they're gonna bring up to the shade or something, but he doesn't have a chance. - You should be all right here. We have to go find some water and food, but we'll be back as soon as possible. - Here's a blanket. He's in bad shape. I don't know if he's going to make it. - Well... We did everything we could. - Is he gonna be all right? - Well, we made him as comfortable as we could. He'll be okay. - Hey, forget about that guy. There's nothing you can do for him. What about us? - Morgan, I've had about enough of you! - Don't waste your time, Phil, he's not even worth it. - It would be wise to listen to him. - Listen. We're all in this together. Save your feuds until after we're rescued. Right now we have more important things to worry about. For one thing, we don't know how long we're gonna be on this island. - Well, what should we do? - The only thing we can do. Go inland and see what we can find. - Well... Let's get on with it then! We can't stand around here looking at each other. - All right. - Let's go. - You know, Morgan, we never got a chance to know each other aboard the ship. Were you on board for pleasure? - Medical reasons. - Medical reasons? - My wife. Can't walk. Spoke to a surgeon in London. Here I am. - Sorry to hear that, Mr. Morgan. - Yeah. - Hope things work out for ya. - Thanks. - Cathy! Don't drift so far! - Oh, not bad. - How are they? - They should do nicely, Mrs. Gordon. Are you okay, Mrs. Gordon? - I've just been thinking. My husband would've been meeting me at the dock just about now. - Don't worry. You'll be seeing him soon. - In the 20 years that we've been married, we've never been separated this long before. - Before you know it, you'll be arriving at that dock, and he'll be there to greet you. Come on, why don't we tell the others about the berries we found? - We'll never find anything here. This is my holiday? All I wanted was to see a little of the world, but I never expected anything like this. Water! - Keep the women away! - Come on, Diane. Come on! - What happened? - Don't go down there. I'll be right back. - What happened? - I don't know. He went for the water. - Well, we've gotta be a lot more careful with what we eat and drink now. This stuff could be all over the island. - We've got some edible berries back there. We could pick enough to hold it through the night. That is, after we bury Pat. - Look. Why don't you take the women and start gathering some of those berries? We could handle it here. - He gets the easy- - Hey, if you wanna pick the berries, why don't you pick them, Morgan? - Forget it, just forget it! The guy's dead. - What kind of island is this? - I don't know, but we better be careful of whatever water we find from now on. - Pat's gone. - Oh, geez. - Let's see what we can do about getting some food for tonight. - How can you think about food after what's happened to Pat? - Hey, we have to survive. Diane, listen to me. We have to start thinking about ourselves. We have to find different ways to exist out here until help comes. And the only way to survive is with food. - He's right, you know. Let's see, how about... Roast duck? Smoked salmon? - Mrs. Gordon, you're getting me really hungry. - I can taste it now, can't you? - Come on, let's go. - Hey, where'd Morgan go with that rock? - Knowing him, he probably went back to England. Something the matter, John? - I don't know. There's something about this place. Something here. Do you feel it? - I had that feeling ever since we moved in from the beach, like somebody's watching us. But who? - If you ask me, I think you've both gone off your rocker. - Damn it, Morgan! Don't you ever stop? - Look- - No, wait, maybe he's right. Maybe we're letting this island get to us. Come on, let's finish up. - All right. - You're right. - Let's see what we've got here. - Mm, they're good. But only pick the dark ones. The others aren't quite ripe yet. - Here. Let's use my shawl, and we can gather the berries there. - That's a good idea. Do you think anyone will ever find us in this awful place? - Eh, I'm sure somebody will come along, Cathy. We couldn't have drifted too far from the main shipping lanes. Besides, there's plenty of food here to keep us going for a long time. What happened? - I was just reaching for a berry, and something bit me. - Well, let me see that. That's a nasty one. Let me put a handkerchief around that. Well, this should hold it until we can fix it properly and wash it out. Does it hurt much? - No. It's just a scratch. I'll be all right. - Well, now at least we know there are animals on the island. Maybe we will have some meat to cook. - What happened to your hand? - Oh, it's nothing. I was just bitten by something in the bushes there. - It should hold until we can clean it out later. - Good. You're a strong woman, Mrs. Gordon. Let's get the others over there so they could set up for the night. And you and I will go down to the boat and check on Mr. Bruin. - Yeah, you know, while we're down there, we might as well pick up whatever supplies are leftover in the survival kit. - I think we've got enough berries here to feed us all for tonight. - I know we don't have much, but try and make yourselves as comfortable as you can. Mr. Quinn and I are going down to the boat to see what we can salvage. - How do we know you just won't take off with the boats and leave us on this godforsaken island? - Morgan, the one thing that bothers me is, that of all the poor souls on that ship worth saving, we had to pull you from the water! - Trieste. There's enough dead wood in this vicinity to get a fire going. - Good. There's some matches in the survival kit on the boat. You ready, Case? - Yeah, let's go. John, it's gonna be getting dark pretty soon. - Let's make this quick. - I'll go check on Mr. Bruin and see how he is. - I'll get the things from the boat, I'll meet you there. - Okay. John! - What is it? - Come and look at him, man. Look at him. - Oh my God. What could've done this? - I don't know, rats? - But that fast? Whatever it was, we've got to keep it to ourselves. The others have enough to worry about. - Yeah, I agree with you there. - I'll cover him up. You get the things from the boat. - Okay. All right. - Tell me something, John. What did you find out there today? - What do you mean? - You and Mr. Quinn... Both been on edge ever since you got back. - It's Mr. Bruin. - The guy was in bad shape, nobody expected him to survive. - It was the way we found him. - Well, how did you find him? - You don't give up, do you, Phil? Well, listen. We didn't want to worry everyone unnecessarily. Now keep this to yourself. When we got to him, his body was picked clean to the bone. - In such a short period of time? From what? - I don't know. Something. Something out there. - I looked at Mrs. Gordon's hand today. - How is it? - She's okay, but... - But what? That's no ordinary animal bite. I've been a vet for years, and I've never seen an animal that would leave a bite mark like that. - I'm frightened. This place makes my skin crawl. - Come on, dear. Let's try to look on the bright side, shall we? This could be a lot worse, you know. - How? - We could still be adrift on the ocean. - Now there's nothing to worry about, Cathy. We'll be okay. You know, we've got plenty of food and a dry place to sleep tonight. And besides, first thing in the morning, we're all gonna be going out there and building signal fires, and we should be rescued in no time. - I know, but I still don't like it here. - You're dreaming! We could be here forever! And as for the food, how are we gonna survive on these? - Don't you lay off, Morgan? - Why? Because I don't think we're ever gonna get off of this miserable island. - I don't care what you think. And I suggest you keep your opinions to yourself. - I wonder what his problem is. - I don't know, but I don't like his attitude. The women are worried enough without him adding to it. - How's the hand, Mrs. Gordon? - Oh, it's just fine. Hardly hurts at all anymore. - Good. I'm glad to hear that. We're gonna be taking turns standing watch tonight. - Oh. Is something wrong? - No, no. It's just a good idea when you're in an unfamiliar place. Are you okay, Cathy? You feel up to taking a turn tonight? - Oh, yes. It's only fair. - Good. I'll let you know when we figure out who relieves who. And stay close to the fire tonight. - Hey, you look cold. - Oh, thank you. - How you holdin' up? - Well, we're stuck here. I guess we'll just have to make the best of it. - You do that very well. - Yeah. I spent most of my childhood on a farm in lowa. My dad used to sit out on the front porch almost every evening after dinner and whittle. I used to watch him for hours. I guess his love for it rubbed off on me. - That's a pretty big switch. From a farm in lowa to a sinking ship in the North Atlantic? - Well, I didn't plan on the ship sinking. I needed to get away, see some other places. There just wasn't anything for me on that farm. - I'll say one thing for ya, you stick to your word. - What do you mean? - About seeing other places. - I bet you've seen a lot of places, working on a ship and all. - Yeah. I've seen a lot of places. I've met a lot of people. And sometimes a farm in lowa doesn't seem like a bad idea. - Sounds like the sea can be lonely. - It's not lonely now. - Hey, Trieste? Who's gonna keep the fire going tonight? - As a matter of fact, Mr. Morgan, we all are. We're gonna take turns standing watch. - Standing watch? For what? You expecting company out here? - You never know, Mr. Morgan. You never know. - Is anything wrong? - No. - John, you want me to set up watch tonight? - Good idea, Case. I'll take the first one. And be sure to tell everyone to keep their eyes open tonight. - Okay. - Mr. Quinn. Mr. Quinn! - Watch it! Watch it! - Case, here! Diane! Are you all right? Are you all right, Mrs. Gordon? - Yes, I'm all right. Just a few cuts and bruises, nothing much to worry about. - How about you, Cathy? Cathy! - No, she's all right. She's more shaken up than anything. - Those eyes. I could see those eyes! They were everywhere! - John, you better come take a look at this! - My leg! My leg! My leg, ooh! - We need something right away to stop the bleeding. - Wait. - My leg! - Give me that. Just hold him up. Hold him up. - Be careful! Be careful! - Morgan, just be thankful we're fixing it at all, will ya? - All right, all right! - Pull him up, don't touch it. - All right. - It's gonna hurt. - You'll be okay, it'll be okay. - Oh! - You'll be all right, Morgan. Just relax. - It hurts! My leg! - Well, what the hell were those things? - I don't know. - Did you see how they came from every direction? Must be millions of them out here. - And they're gonna be back. I know they're gonna be back. And when they do, we better be ready for ‘em. - Well, we can't stay here. - No, you're right. This place is much too open. Our best bet is to either head for a higher ground or get back down to the boat. - Boat? If we go in the water, how can we survive? - Phil, we don't stand a chance if we stay on this island. - Everybody's gonna have a say in that decision. - Even Morgan? - Even Morgan. We figure we have two things we can do. Either head for higher ground and find a better place to fight these things off, or get back to the beach to be near the boat. - Well, what do you think we should do? - We'll wait until it gets lighter, find a better place to fight these things off, get some food together, and get off this island. - I'll go along with that. - Yes. Anything to get away from those things. - Finally, we're getting somewhere. - Anyone else have any other suggestions? All right, rest up. We'll leave in a little while. - Hey, Morgan, we're gonna have to keep this clean. - Cathy. Look what I found for you. - Oh, Mrs. Gordon! - All right, let's see, here we go. Now let's fold this down a little bit. - There's not much you can do for this, I'm afraid. - Well, maybe we could hold it together a bit here. - Oh, that's wonderful. - There. How's that? - Morgan. Will you be able to keep up to us with that leg? - Are you trying to get rid of me? Is that what you're trying to do? Huh? I'll keep up with you if I have to crawl. You're not gonna leave me on this island alone. You're not! You're not! - Morgan- - You're not! - Morgan. As much as I don't like you, we won't leave you. How are you ladies this morning? - Well, we didn't exactly get much sleep last night, but we're okay. - How far do you think we'll have to go? - It shouldn't be that far, but it all depends on how fast Morgan will be able to move with that leg. - His leg is pretty bad, isn't it? - I'm afraid so. If he doesn't get some kind of medical attention soon... - Listen, you have enough to worry about with him. We should be fine. - Yeah, we'll be fine. - I wish he had your spirit. All right, let's move out. Can't waste anymore time. And everybody, stick close together. - It's in the tree! - Come here, come here. Stay close together, come on. - Oh! Oh no! My leg! He got me! My leg! - There he goes! - Quinn! Forget it, Quinn! Quinn, forget it! - He went through those bushes! - I got him! I got him, did you see that? I got him! - Take it easy. - I got him. - Come on, let's go. - I got him! Look, look! - Yes, okay. We see him, Morgan! - Let's go, let's go, let's go! - I'm sorry, Mrs. Gordon, I didn't mean to scare you like this, but we've gotta stay together. - I'll stay close after this, believe me. - Oh my God. - Hey, John. - Mr. Trieste. - One minute. - Mr. Trieste. - One minute, Miss Gordon. Stay right there, I'll be right back. - But... - John, we better take a break. Morgan's having a rough time with his leg. - All right, we'll take a break. We're gonna take a break. How's it going? - I don't get it, John. We're supposed to be in the North Atlantic someplace. If you ask anybody who didn't know any better, I'd swear we're in the tropics. - I know, this whole damn place doesn't make any sense. - I don't get it. - Maybe its just a bad dream. Where's Mrs. Gordon? Mrs. Gordon! Mrs. Gordon! Don't! - Oh, it's delicious! Try some! - You could've been killed! - No, look! There are fish in there! Oh, oh! Doesn't this feel wonderful? Oh... - Ooh! - Oh, Mrs. Gordon. The shawl. - No, I want you to have it, dear. - Thank you. - Cathy, it looks lovely with your dress. - Mr. Morgan, this will keep you a bit cooler, okay? John, what's our next move? - Get some food. But first we're gonna have to build some kind of shelter against those things. - Well, how many of those things do you think there were? - I just hope there's not many more than what we've seen so far. - If what we saw last night was all of them, we stand a pretty good chance of fighting them off with some kind of shelter. - We have another problem. If Morgan's leg gets any worse, I might have to amputate it. - Amputate? No, we don't have the equipment to amputate out here. - You won't have to worry about that. No one's touching my leg. - I don't think I could eat any more of those berries. - Oh, I know. That water felt so great. Didn't it, Cathy? - Oh, I could stay there forever. - How do you feel, Cathy? - Much better. - Good. We're gonna have to be leaving shortly. - I'm done! - What's that? - Mrs. Gordon! - My leg! - My leg! - How's Mrs... - No! No! Is she... - Yeah. - No! - We've gotta move out of here as fast as we can. We're not taking anymore chances. Every time we stop, somebody gets killed, injured! We're gonna leave! - Mrs. Gordon? - Mrs. Gordon! No! No! - Cathy, Cathy. Cathy, there's nothing you can do. - No! - We have to go. - Let's get the hell out of here! - Come on, everybody, let's go. Is Morgan okay? - Yeah, he's doing all right, I got him. - Put 5,000 on the Braden stock. Fire Edwards! I don't need a butler who thinks for himself. I'm coming home! I'm coming home. I'm coming home! Get away from me! I don't need your help, I'm no cripple! - All right, take it easy, will ya? - Get away! Get away! - Morgan! - I don't need- - Morgan! - I don't need your help! I'm all right! I'm all right! - Are you crazy? - Get back over here! - Morgan! - Morgan, don't! Stop! - Morgan! - Phil, stay with the women. There goes Morgan! Over here! - Where did he go? - I don't know. - He's down over there! - Morgan! Morgan! Don't! - Help! - Another acid pool. - There's nothing we can do for him now. Let's get back to the others. Let's hope they're still there. - That bastard. - Don't say that. - We've gotta keep moving. It's our only chance before it gets dark. - Yeah, he's right. We really don't have much further to go, but we better move now. - Thank God. I don't know how much more of this place I can take. - How's your neck? - Oh, it's fine now. For a while there I thought it was gonna be all over. - You think we'll make it? - We'll make it. Don't worry, we'll make it. - Mr. Trieste. John. I want to apologize for the way I've been acting lately. I mean, I know I've gotten hysterical every single time we've gotten attacked, and I just wanted to let you know I'm gonna be stronger from now on. - I know, Cathy. It's been hard, But we're gonna make it. We're gonna make it. - Jesus! - Quinn! - Quinn! My God! - Let me hold it. - Quinn! - Wait a minute, I can get my... Hold on a second. Easy, easy. I got it. - John, it's- - Don't worry about it. Just get up here. We need you, Quinn. Come on. - I'm all right, I'm all right, I'm all right. Oh, man. - All right. Watch out, that dirt is giving way. Get over here. - I got it. - What's wrong? - No, listen. - What is that? - It sounds like a swarm of bees. - It sounds like it's coming from the top. - All right, we're gonna go take a look. When we get up there, everybody stay low. - Okay. - Let's take advantage if they attack. - We can't fight them off here. - There must be hundreds of them. - What should we do? - We can't stay here. - The only chance we've got is the boat. - Let's go. Listen! - They stopped screaming. - What's that mean? - Come on, run! They're coming! Come on, run! Come on! - Phil! - Phil! - Oh, Phil, he never knew what hit him. Sorry, Phil. - Case. Get down to the beach! Quick! Get the boat ready. We're not gonna have time. - Okay, you be ready. - And watch out for any more traps! - All right! - Come on, get down to the beach! - We can't leave you alone! - I'll stay with him! Get down to the beach! Go! - John. - Why are you stopping? Oh my God! Okay, Cathy. Now... When I say go... Start to run. Do you understand me? - Run where? - I don't know, go around them. Go anywhere. Just go. Go! - Diane! - John... Get the hell outta here. Go on, go on. You gotta get out of here. - God! - Where's Diane? Oh, God. - Come on, they're coming! We've got to go! Come on, we've gotta get out of here! - All right, hurry! Head for the beach! I'll be right behind you. Oh, Case. A ship! It's sending a life boat! Get in the water! - Come on! John! - What were those things?
