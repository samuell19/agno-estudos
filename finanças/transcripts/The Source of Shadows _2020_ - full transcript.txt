Solomon. Solomon, I'm so sorry. I have to leave you now, sweetheart. I cannot stay here. You will have to be strong on your own like I know you can. All you need to do is follow our three rules and they will keep you safe as they always have done. You remember our rules, don't you, Solomon? The first rule. We must always give back to the forest that provides for us. So when you hunt or scavenge, do it for two. One for the forest and one for you. The second rule. When your will is almost gone and you feel like giving up, find comfort in singing our song. The third and final rule. This is the most important rule of all. You must never ever let go of the rope, Solomon. The rope is your guide, this land is your home, and the rope will keep you safe from harm within it. Always hold onto it and you will have hope. Whatever you do, don't lose the rope. I love you. Solomon. Don't lose the rope. I love you. And you feel like giving up, find comfort in singing our song. The third and final rule. This is the most important rule of all. You must never ever let go of the rope, Solomon. The rope is your guide, this land is your home, and the rope will keep you safe from harm within in it. Always hold onto it and you will have hope. Whatever you do, don't lose the rope. I love you. Mother? Hello. Hello? Can you read me? This is Sailing Vessel Leilani. Do you copy? No. God. Hello? Is there anyone out there? Catherine. Fuck. All right, I've been keeping this one for last because it's my favorite. Look at the hardwood floors. These beautiful ceilings. It's such a steal because their daughter died in a car accident. It's so sad but the father and mother are just really anxious. Bestia. Olivia. Olivia. I see your light on. I know you're not sleeping. Don't play possum. You look like a coal miner. Give me that. I told you to go to bed an hour ago. But I'm not sleepy, Ellie. Mm hm. What's this? This again? It's stuck in my head. Starting to freak me out. What would mom and dad say? Don't tell them. I won't if you stop drawing these creepy doodles. I can't draw anything else. I don't know why. Look, we talked about this. You wandered off into the woods and spent a scary night outside, but we found you the next morning, didn't we? I can't remember what happened. That's for the best. I mean, it was weeks ago. You gotta let it go. You told me to wait and you didn't come back. No, that's not what happened. I was held back and you wandered off. That's the truth. But... Do you wanna make mom sad again? No. She cried her eyes out, you know. But think about it. You were in no real danger. It's not like there's wolves in those woods. No. Something else. What are you talking about? I think I wasn't alone. It was just your imagination. No, it was real. Enough! I think it followed me. Oh, come on. It's just your stupid toy. Now, I don't wanna hear about it ever again. If you don't promise me right now, I'm gonna show this. No, don't. Are we in agreement? Are we good? Okay. Bed now. You know you're not allowed to have boys over. It's not a boy and it's none of your business. Ellie, don't go. Listen, you're a big girl and you know there's nothing to be scared of. So just go to sleep. Say anything to anyone and you're dead. Understood? All right, goodnight. Olivia. Are you okay? That sound. I think it came from Olivia's room. Little sister giving you trouble? She hasn't been the same since that night. Those drawings. And I can't remember the last time she laughed. Give her a break. You too, really? Come on, you know what I mean. And besides, we're at least partially to blame for. She was found and she's fine. You should go check on her. All right. Wait for me. Olivia. Olivia, quit fooling around. Do you hear me? Olivia. Olivia? Olivia, what the hell? Stop playing hide and seek. All right Olivia, this isn't funny anymore. If you don't come out of that closet in three seconds. I swear to god, Olivia. Ellie. Olivia. Olivia. I remember everything now. We'll be together forever. They followed you here? Yes. Who followed you? The evil one. He looked like any other man. He was dressed like any other man. He almost walked to find me, but I left a mess for his mistakes and I killed him. Scratched him from his head down. That will be done. You killed him, the man with the pike? The man who followed you? No one else followed you. God, that took forever. Yeah, when did Whole Foods become the place to be on a Saturday night. Think people would be at bars not buying a spread of quinoa. You ready to get depressed? We're two of those people? Quinoa and all. Well, we have a legitimate excuse. What's the rest of the world's? Sacrifices you make when family is visiting. Speaking of sacrifices, your sister I presume. Like you got room to talk. Look, it's a rough time. I think we can afford to cut Cody a little sanitary slack. Just a week though, right? Sure. Just gonna drop these towels off in the room. I'll be right back. Hey, I didn't realize you were. Did you leave the guest room light on? Negative. Maybe she's home. Cody? What is it? Nothing. I'll be down in a minute. Still no sign of her, huh? Guess she's still one of the few clinging on to a social life. Well I put some of her clothes away. May make her feel more at home. Just don't make her feel too at home, all right. Don't get me wrong. I love your sister. I'm just not in the market for any long term roommates. Except the one I married. Babe. Should we be good hosts and wait up for her? Trust me. She'll think we'll better hosts if we don't. Besides I'm beat. Let's just go to bed. Oh come on, it's 9:30. That's gotta be some sort of fucking record. Well, we have the bedtime of parents without the annoyance of kids. Don't forget about your sister. Ow. Really hurt. You think she'll find a job? Depends. Your office is hiring? That'll be an interesting experience. Probably the best of your life. Please, I prefer to think happy thoughts before I sleep. I'll call in some favors on Monday. See what we can do. Hey, thank you. Seriously, I really appreciate it. Just know that if I had siblings, they'd be really fucked up and you'd have to deal with them. Okay 24 seven. Well thank God. I think you are plenty of work for me. Goodnight. Goodnight. Hi, I'm Sophia. Who are you? I'm Steve. Hi, Steve. Is this your first time? Well it's your first time calling me, isn't it? Yeah. You sound really sexy. Where are you right now? I'm in the office. Everyone's gone home now. Where are you? I'm in bed. I was gonna start touching myself. Do you think I should? If you want. My breast feel so soft. I'm thinking about your long, hard cock. I'm fucking you. I'm fucking you right now. Good. Fuck me. Fuck me so hard I can't sit again for a week. I'm fucking you. Yes, keep going. Keep fucking me. Oh, that's good. You're in so deep. I'm in a pitch. Keep going. Keep fucking me. Oh, I'm gonna come. I can only go once. Are you ready? She did not. Yes, she did. Christ, that is so humiliating. I know right. What did she say? I mean, Christ. I'd be beating myself if that happened to me. Japanese suicide. Listen B, I've gotta get this. I'll call you back in a minute, yeah. All right, all right, bye. Hey baby, I'm Rita. What are you wearing? Nothing. Nothing but my tight pants. Take them off. Okay, I'm taking them off. Call me Sir. No Daddy. Call me Sir. Sir. I'm taking them off, Sir. Are you lying to me? No, Sir. What are you doing now? I'm naked now. I'm lying out on my bed as I touch myself. You didn't call me Sir. Sorry, Sir. Good. Bark like a dog for me. Woof. No. Like a real dog. Woof. Howl. Ow. I don't believe you. Your barking. That you're touching yourself. None of it. I really don't think you care, do you? Of course I care, baby. You're just gonna have to believe me. Call me Sir, not baby. Send me a picture of yourself right now and I will. No. Why not? Because I don't want to. I'm spending the money. How do I know you are who you say you are? Because I am who I say I am. So Rita is your real name? Yes. Well, you were much more convincing when you were Sophia. Fuck you, man, I'm gonna call the police. Fuck. Hi, I'm Sophia. Who are you? Hi Steve. Is this your first time? I was gonna start touching myself. Do you think I should? Yeah, you like that. Fuck me so hard I can't sit down for a week. I'll do anything you want. I know who you really are. Stephanie. I know your parents are away from home. But what do you think they would say if they knew what you were doing? What about your friends? Once they've heard these tapes, do you think they'd ever look at you the same way again? If you don't do what I say, they will hear them. It doesn't matter who you say you are. Rita. Sophia. Stephanie. Everyone will know you really are once I'm done with you. You'd be an attraction. A freak. An anecdote at a party. That girl I know who does phone sex. You should hear her, mate. So they go to the computer and bring up your website. Yes, there will be a website just for you. Who are they really hurting? Some girl whose picture is on the screen. Do you think your friends will find it funny or sad? Probably funny. Are you fucking there? Getting colder. Little warmer. Warmer. Warmer. Getting hot now. Boo. There's a man in my house. He's on the phone. Don't ever do that again. You listen closely because I won't repeat myself. If you hang up on me, I will destroy you. If you lie to me again, I will destroy you. If you disobey me again, I will destroy you. If you call the police again, I will destroy you. Just so you are totally clear on what will happen if you do any of these things. First I will share them with your parents. Your friends will be next. Then I will spread them like a virus until you hear the sound of your voice so often you will wish you were born mute. Do you understand me? You have to the count of three. One. Two. I understand. You didn't call me, Sir. I understand, Sir. Right. Forwards. Right. Go to the door. Good. Now we're going to start again. What? We're going to do this again and you aren't going to pretend. You're going to be you and it will be real. Do you understand? Yes, Sir. Are you ready? Yes, Sir. If I don't believe you, I hang up. Let's begin. Hi. I'm Stephanie. What's your name? I don't believe you. Sorry, I'm sorry. Start again. Hi. I'm Stephanie. Who are you? Jeremy. What are you doing? This is your last chance. Are you ready? Who are you? Jeremy. And you? Stephanie, Sir. That's a beautiful name. Tell me Stephanie, how do you feel? I'm scared, Sir. Good. So you don't lie like all the other girls. I won't lie to you, Sir. Where are you? I'm by my window. Tell me truthfully. How did you lose your virginity? It was at a house party. I liked this boy for ages. He went to the same school. We went to the toilets and yeah. How old were you? 17. Was it your party? No, a friend's. How did it feel? Not that bad, not that good. It was over very quickly. It was a bit anti climatic. What happened to the boy? We didn't talk again. Why'd you do this? Do what? Phone sex. I don't know. The money and I thought I'd be good at it. Why? I don't know. I just did. You take that tone, you get punished. Open the door. Take your top off. What? You disobeyed me. Fine. This is what you want. This is what you fucking want. Huh? If we're gonna do this, then fine let's do this, but I'm not gonna pretend I'm enjoying this. You're gonna keep this going, we do it this way. Do you touch yourself when you're on the phone? Yes. Do you want me to touch myself here now? Yes. I'm a good girl, Sir. I won't lie to you. If I give you these, will you leave me alone? Yes. What do you want me to do with them now, Sir? Throw them to me. Are you ready? Yeah. Three. Two. One. Shit. Please, please Steph, stop. Don't call the police. Tell me what I need to do to make it right, please. I'll delete all the audio files. I'll delete everything. Do you want money? I can give you money. Please answer me. Answer me. If you call the police, I'm fucked. I've got children. You'll ruin their life. Stephanie please. Please, I'm sorry. A stupid joke. Please. Stephanie, I'm sorry. Take off your clothes now. And don't forget to call me Sir.
