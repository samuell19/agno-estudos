God, look at that big ugly monster. It's been what, 30, 40 years? It still gives me the creeps. Still keep expecting one of these pig-faced faced monsters to come jumping out at me. Okay, let's see. Begin at the beginning. Chapter one, I am bored. So, maybe a ring to it. I don't want too much cross on that one. This pen ran out ink. I may never find another that writes. Once upon a time in a galaxy far, far away. Dammit, Trent, don't be such a wise ass. This is important. This can end up being the most important historical record of the new world. Let me see. I didn't think my memoirs could be this hard. How I saved the world by Harry Trent. Out, I will let that pass. I've never write it. I am, I was a thief. A thief or not, I'm the man to tell the story 'cause I was there at the beginning. I saw more of how it started than anyone else, alive or dead. I was there when the five-year reign of the lzags ended. I helped to end it. Started one night back around the turn of century. I was on a job. Hadn't been a good day and it wasn't getting any better. Shit! Hey, you guys aren't supposed to be carrying guns. It against the goddamn law! So, call a cop! Thanks. Nice shooting, dude. Now what? I say we blow the door off. You want to blast the whole freaking building down, wouldn't you? Steinler would love that. Hey, Trent! Let's talk, okay? Sure. What do you wanna talk about. All we want is the tape back. Tape? What tape? Don't try to bullshit me, Trent. If you don't give yourself up right now, we just have to call the feds in. You'll spend the rest of your life in prison. This isn't just your everyday industrial espionage, you know? We're talking heavy weaponry. Hell, you'll be lucky if they put you to sleep. What are you, a commie? Commie. No, I'm to a commie. I'm just a regular old red-blooded American capitalist that's all there is. How to make a buck. Sure make a pretty decent killing off for this thing. But don't you guys worry so bad because all my offers are from our fellow bourgeoisie so itisn't gonna leave the country. All right, go call the feds. No, no, no, I say we blast him. Get moving. I'm sorry but your saver-easy lighter is now out of fuel but don't worry. Just toss it away and stop by your neighborhood. Hey, Trent, you got a light? No, sorry, I quit smoking when the cartons start talking back to me. You've had it, you know. My partner's calling for the feds. Your number is up. You're trapped, there ain't no way out. We'll see. Great. Oh, I love it, I love it. I always wanted one of these things. Hey, what's happening in there! Hey! Those doors open for me, baby, here we go. Code number, please. What? I'm sorry, but the hangar doors cannot be opened without the authorized code number. But I don't have any code number. Then you cannot open the hangar doors. Well, how am I gonna get outta here? I'm sorry, I do not have that information. Trent, come on, don't play with that stuff in there. Trent! Computer, computer, what would happen if I ram the doors? What? Will the ship survive the impact if I ram through the doors? That is not recommended procedure yeah, yeah, okay, I get it but could the ship take it? Major stress analysis test on both doors should would be necessary... Ah, shut up. This is your last warning. Shit! Attention, attention PSP-2758. It was not cleared for take off. I repeat, it was not cleared for take off. This is PSP-2758 to Metro control. Go fuck yourself, Metro control. Over and out. Hey, you, what's wrong with the ship? What's happening here? I believe the unorthodoxed manner of your departure has damaged the controls. I suspect you will find some difficulty in maneuvering. I knew this is gonna be a bad day. I knew it, I knew it. Okay, what do I do? Any attempt to repair the damage by anyone except an authorized repairman will render the factory warranty void. Warranty? I don't care about warranties. I want the ship fixed. The damage sustained is not repairable without the facilities of a competent repair station. You mean I'm stuck? Affirmative. It looks so far away. Hey, computer, identify those ships. I'm sorry, they are not registered with my database. Asian, middle eastern? I believe not. Without more information, I can make no reasonable assessment of their place of origin. But certain structural peculiarities are not consistent with design patterns of this planet. My god. They were ships. Dozens, hundreds, maybe thousands of them. Big ugly things that came out of the blackness that surround it. Can we signal the earth? We've got to warn them somehow. Early warning systems have already spotted the approaching ships. Officials are now attempting to communicate with the alien vessels. Attention, alien vessels. Attention, alien vessels. We greet you in peace. We wish to welcome you in the spirit of friendship. Please, identify yourselves. I repeat, please, identify yourselves. I was a fly speck to their fleet. Just a little nothing out there. Take note, what did they care about me. They had a whole planet to conquer. This is a historic moment in the history of our planet but we cannot allow you to enter our atmosphere until you've identified yourselves and communication has been established between our cultures. I repeat, we greet you in peace. We have no wish to engage in violent confrontation. Please signal if you understand. Attention, alien vessels. Attention. We greet you in peace. We greet you in peace. We wish to welcome you in the spirit of friendship. This is a historic moment in the history of our planet but we cannot allow you. Till you have identified yourselves and communication have been established between our cultures. Please signal if you understand us. Please. Five minutes later, it was over. That time, the alien ships cease fire and the whole planet was dark. This wasn't fair at all. It wasn't a battle, it wasn't war. The aliens just moved in and kicked ass. In space, I could see little flicker of fires sweeping over the dead city. I wanted to puke. It's over. Didn't stand a chance. The shortest war in history. What were those things? I do not have that information. That was rhetorical question, anyway. But this one isn't. What's gonna happen with me. The situation isn't as grave as it might be. Yeah, what are you talking about? I'm heading off to nowhere. I can't turn the ship around and probably gonna die in space. I have run a quick analysis of your present trajectory. You're actually traveling in y ellipse. Not unlike a planetary orbit. Your path will eventually intersect with that of the earth. You will be able to land. I think I love you. When can we land? In approximately five years, three months, 17 days. Five years? Three months, I'll be dead. Negative. This ship contains emergency provisions to last a crew of 20 several months. More than enough to last one man the required period. The fuel will run out in a matter of months but the ship will continue on its present course in accordance with the laws governing astrophysics. Life support systems will continue to function indefinitely. I'll go crazy. Possibly. 47. 48. 49. 382. It's not cooked. The food preparation unit was damaged during take off. Great, the bill circles. Hm. Hm. Strike! I'll be glad if you want to. You know, I always liked you, a lot. I mean it. You're the most beautiful woman I've ever been with. Now, if you don't wanna do anything, it's okay. It is, really. I mean, I'd be happy just to stare into your eyes. Really beautiful. Feel your hair, your skin. It's so warm. But it'd be okay if I kiss you? Oh, thanks. Let me out here! The day just dragged by. Dragged by. Nothing to do, no one to talk to. No TV, no talks. I don't, can I say that? I tried to keep myself in shape. I tried to keep my mind going. It wasn't easy. I focused my attention on the things I missed and the things I was gonna catch up on when I got home. I even dabbled in the arts. I'm on this bed and I'm on this bed oh, I'm on this bed and it missed me off 'cause I'm on this bed and I wanna leave here I wanna leave I wanna leave now can't stand it can't stand it can't stand it Mr. Trent? Go away. You need your exercises. Don't nudge, I don't wanna exercise. Your muscles will atrophy. What do I care? Shit, I'm going crazy. Sure, okay, just give me some drugs or something. I cannot prescript without the permission of an authorized doctor. What, out here? I'm sorry. It may interest you the know that we are approaching the midpoint of your journey. I thought you would be pleased. Are you kidding? Now, I've got to repeat this whole trip all the way back! Dammit, dammit, dammit! In a few weeks, we will intercept the orbit of Mercury. You will pass close enough to see the surface. That's nice. Wake me when we get there. The cooling system's not making it. You are very fortunate. A few million miles closer to the sun at the hull of the ship would begin to melt. Oh, I just have all the luck, don't 1? We are currently at our nearest point, the planet Mercury. Who gives a shit? You are the only human being ever to look directly a planet's surface. So?? You are very likely the only human being who ever will, now. Show on ship seven sector four out there. Roger, all clear on sector four, out. Take a look at this. It's an earth ship. That's impossible. You were in the force, you know a private shuttle if you see one. That's not the one in the operation in years. Not since the peak of arisno. Just look at it. Show in ship seven to base, come in. What are you doing? Reporting the ship. You can't do that. Vessel seven, what's happening out there? Nothing, we got a pogey in the screen but it's gone now. Are you crazy? Look, don't you understand? There's somebody on board on the ship. Somebody who escaped before the takeover. A free human being. We can't turn whoever it is to one of those monsters down there. God, it's beautiful. I've never seen anything so incredibly beautiful my whole life. Sure we have enough power to land? More than enough in the storage cells. I'm glad you convinced me not to use them all, buddy. I would advice extreme caution in approach. Monitor whatever signals you can. Out of here. You may want it that in here but I don't. Pull in your ship, come in, come in, whoever you are! Pull in your ship! We've got to report. We've got to report. You have some people to support. They'll send us to the research centers as Guinea pigs. I can search those rats anyway. No! Just do what we're supposed to, that's all. Just follow orders. I am. Good slaves of the new order. And if I wanna use this device, it's better this way. It really is. I had a feeling it was gonna be this way. All right, scan for some place uninhabited. I don't think I want any company when it land. I landed out in the field someplace. I grabbed a gun just in case and started out on foot. I didn't see any people at all. That was fine, that suited me. I just enjoyed the air and the sky, the trees and grass and water. It was great. Well, I don't know why you saved my ass but I'm sure glad you did. Thanks. Where are you from? Well, it's a long story. Well then, you won't wanna come back twice, do you? You can save it while I take you back to the others. What others? You'll see. Change planet. What does that supposed to mean. You'll see. So, you got a name? Yes. What is it? Dana. Just Dana? Surnames aren't used here anymore. They don't seem to matter. Huh, my name's Harry. Just Harry. Come along. So, then I went off with this strange lady because after all, what else did I have to do? Maybe she could tell me what have gone on while I was gone. Besides, she was a looker, even then. She led me to this crumbling pile of lumber where she and her bunch of friends live. On the way, she told me about the geeks she call izags. When I said I never heard of them, she looked at me as if I sprouted antlers. She wouldn't tell me who they were. She said she was gonna take me to someone she call the old man and let him tell me. Old man, sheesh. Dana, who's your new friend? I found him distance out of town. I thought I asked you not to go down there? Well, sir, I'm glad she did. She saved my hide. Oh, I gather you've met the town's inhabitants. Oh, yeah, the lzags or whatever you call them. God no. A man who doesn't know the lzags. Where are you from? I'm originally from Chicago but lately, I've been away. Obviously, not too far away. That's what you think. Tell us about yourself. Okay, my name is Harry. Harry Trent. What? What did I say? Don't play games with me, young man. Hey, I'm not playing games with anybody. Where have you been for the last five years, Mr. Harry Trent? If I told you, you wouldn't believe me. Give us a try. All right, okay. I've been out in space. I stole a shuttle, I got stuck in orbit, went out past Mercury. It was rg steinler shuttle, as a matter of fact. You know, darovic steinler. Where is the shuttle now? Near here. Well, take us to it. Well, geez, thanks for the hospitality. I'll show myself out. Walt. Hey, you know, five years being stuck in space. All I could think of is seeing a friendly smiling human face and if this is what I'm gonna get here, then I'm going someplace else. Please, let us explain. Forget it! Wait! Wait. Hey, don't play with me, woman. Sit down. Put that think away. Sit! Nobody orders me. Sit. Please, Mr. Trent, bear with us just a little. You see, you've become somewhat famous while you were gone. Sure, yeah, would you mind telling tiger Lily to put the knife away? Please, Dana. There, now, I feel more comfortable. All right, you wanna play? Come at Mel come on. Now, sit both of you. Dana, please. She started it. Dana, put that away. There's enough violence in the world outside. We're the last remnants of civilization. We and the few on plains like us. Let conduct ourselves as such. Let's have something to eat. Let's talk. Let's get to know one another a little better. It been his entire life since the lzags came. All this is quite normal to him. He's even happy. Where these izags come from anyhow? Who knows? We don't communicate with them. We are no more to them than cattle are to us. You know, I saw the attack from space. It's horrible. I was worse from down here. I guess so. So where did they come from? You know what they're doing here? I don't know. I know as much about them as anybody. I have scars to prove it. I spent over a year with them while they study me and I learned what I could about them. They wanted to put me to death but I escaped. They despise the sciences, except for two. The science of warfare and the science of astronomy and they know only as much biology as permits them to effectively torture their conquered races. The poor creatures you met in town today. Ha, poor creatures. They were result of the 1zag experiment. They do it to find out more about human biology. They captured and they dissect them alive. Alive, Trent. And then when the lzags were through, the once that are still living, they set lose. Poor half-witted unfortunates. Who almost killed me. Oh, I believe that, but they are no more capable of real evil as a wolf or a jackal. So, here. So, what's happened to the rest of the human race? Well, those who were left just pray pressingly over the face of the earth. They're in hiding just as we are. So, how do you live? Well, life goes on. And even the worst conditions, men and women still make love and children are still being born. Now, about that shuttle. Pardon, you were the telling the truth. Don't mind you that I doubted you for one minute. All right, now, I suppose you tell me exactly why my name is so well known around here? Well, I could do better than tell you but first, have you got the tape? What tape? You're in the process of stealing an info tape from darovic steinler lab when you were caught. When you fled in you shuttle. How do you guys know these things? Thief, the tape. Oh, geez, I guess it's still there. I mean I haven't thought about it since the night that I stole it. Jesus! Trent! Trent! Look out! Come on! Come on! No! Forget about him! I don't think the izags knew why why we're here. They were hunting us for sport. They killed him for fun. Let's go to the shuttle and find that tape. I brought her into the place I called home for the last five years. It was embarrassing. At least could've let the place air out but who expected company? Anyway, she didn't exactly live buckden palace herself. I finally find the tape and plugged it in and we listened. It was all very complicated technical stuff and I'm sure most of it went over Dana's head. L, of course, had a scientific background. It's pretty familiar to me. Sheryl? Mr. Trent? Sheryl? Can you analyze the tape we just plugged in and give me an idea what it says? Analyzing. The tape describes a device called neutron-90 bomb with could, in theory, be programmed to destroy any person or group of people selectively according to their genetic coding. What does that mean? In a broad sense, if a device were given genetic characteristics of any human or animal type, upon activation, a broad spectral beam would be emitted which would cause complete cellular destruction to all specimens of that type. Do you mean to say that if I program this bomb to kill blue-eyed eskimos and set it off? All specimens of the aforementioned type will be reduced to an earth probe plasma. Sold. By the same token, set for a particular genetic characteristics of an individual human being, the later result will restricted to that one individual. Set for the genetic characteristics common to all human beings... All humankind will be wiped out. Affirmative. Great. The ultimate weapon. Snuff out you next neighbor, wipe out all of Asia. Program to destroy totally alien life form, could it do that? Assuming sufficiently analogy of physiological make up. I don't believe it. I just don't believe it. Yeah... - Away out, Trent. Finally a way out! Okay, okay, don't let your hopes up, though. Is location of this underground place given? Affirmative. Okay, is there enough power in this thing to fly us there then? Affirmative. Trent, we're home free. We're home free! Wait, wait, wait, all right. We'll take care of the old man then we'll come back here and we'll make plans. Come on. Come on. Among Dana's group was this technical wiz named Benton who tinkered the shuttle into shape so we could steer it. Steer it like a truck but at least we could point it in the right direction and we took off to Richmond. Not exactly what I planned to do in my return to earth but hey, I'd save the planet first and then party a little. How much further, Trent? I don't know, about another 100 miles. We can't make too much speed flying this low to the ground. Hey, you wanna try flying this thing? Me? Sure. You know I can't fly. Hey, come on, it's easy. I can't fly. Watch, here. I'll put it on automatic. There it goes. Now, all you had to do is sit at the wheel. I can't, I can't. - Come on, come on. Here it goes. Take hold of the wheel. All right, now, here it goes. Put it back on manual. There's nothing to it. And you better be sure. I'm sure nothing can go wrong. What, what was it? Sit down! Can we fight? No weapons. We just have to outrun it if we can. They're fast but let's see if they can maneuver. Well, I hope you can. Trent, I think you lost them. Maybe. Those animals are gonna kill each other. Look out! One down! One to go! Holy shit, I can't get him lost. We're going down. You okay? Yeah, did you manage to save the weapons? No, I didn't save the weapons. I didn't get my toothbrush, my water either. I didn't have time to pack. Well, all right, don't be pissed. Just we could've saved the handguns, that's all. Yeah, so do I. I don't even know where we are, much where we have to go. I think we're pretty close to Richmond. Yes, supposed that we're 50 miles away from the plant. That would mean we have to search everywhere within a 50-mile radius up here. So, that'd be what? That would be, 8,000 square miles. Good luck. We'll get help. That'd be nice. Well, we got to try. I mean we got nothing lose and everything to gain. Do you think we'd better be traveling at night and resting during the day? No, the aliens see better at night and they're more active in the dark. What's it like? What's it like to live in the space alone? Like prison, only worse. You in prison? Once in a while. Not really the character developing experience they make it out be. It's mostly boring with a little bit of violence thrown in. What are you thinking about, alone five years? People, mostly. Female people. I bet. Yeah, I had some pretty specific plans of what I wanted to do when I got back here but, the change in this world. The old man said some things don't change. It was all figured out, down to the color of the eyes and hair. Everything. What color of eyes that she have. That they have. They? One woman wasn't enough for you, Mr. Trent? One woman couldn't possibly handle it. Craving, hunger deep. Really? You're shy, aren't you? Well, that's a tough and miserable world out there and if you want it, then you have to go get it. Oh then, what is it that you want? I want you to show me everything that you were thinking about for the last five years. Walt. There's something out there. No, there's not. Yeah? Help! Dana. Harry! Dana. Harry! Harry! Harry! Help! Help! Harry help! Help! Harry! Dana! Run! Move, quickly! Get on the tree! Come on, move it, move it! The hell is that? I don't know. The lzags supports mantis thief from other planets. It must be one of them. I hope they can't climb. Come on, bring it out here! We'll just knock you out! Oh, Barry! Give him the action, ax it! That monster is dead. Now, isn't that fun? You folks all right up there? Yeah, thanks to you guys. We saw your fire. Not a good idea of fire. Not out here tonight. If you don't like the cold, why don't you dress a little warmer. Well, we left our clothes over, ah, forget it. So, how's your friend? Well, she's asleep. I don't know how after last and everything. Drink that herb tea? Yeah, yeah, finally. Whoa, something in it? Not in it. All natural ingredients we grow on right here. We find to make a nice little tranquilizer. Uh-huh, so that means that this fragrant aroma that I sense is, um. Here. You have some. There you go. You grew this, huh? Nature provides. Oh, I appreciate it. Smooth. I guess you have to work your way up to here. You give it up. Hey, hey. Been around since, been a while, that's all. Evidently. Nice morning. Looks like rain. Yeah. I guess the big catastrophe drove you here, huh. Not, actually. About a week after it happened that I even heard about it. Oh, yeah? Yeah, I've been out here for four years or so, moving off the land. Nature provides. Say that again. Then one day, all these people came into the woods, they were starving, they were lost. They're looking for food. And you took 'em in. No, I shot them. You shot them? Fucking right. These are my woods, I can't afford to take in every stray that comes wandering through. Well, what about all these other people around here with you? Well, eventually, I ran out of cartridges. You saved us. Help you with you people looking so damn silly sitting up in that tree, I couldn't shoot you. I guess we did. So, where are we? Right here. What I wanna know is how far we, I mean, what I... Why don't you give me that? No, no, I'm all right. Fine, so, how far are we from here like in relation to Virginia. You're in Virginia. No, really. You're in Virginia. You're about 40 miles west of Richmond. Richmond, that's great. Where is it from here? I'd say it's about well that makes sense. So, how do we get there? You walk. We walk? 40 miles? Well, 1, I mean, we gotta, we really gotta get there in a hurry. Why, what's there? It's a secret, I can't tell you. It's a bomb. Bomb? You heard about that? Oh, yeah, it was a feature story in mother earth news. You might have a little trouble getting from here to Richmond, as a matter of fact. Why is that? You have to cross mad dog Kelly's territory. Mad dog Kelly? What's that? Some guy carved himself a little kingdom out over there. Quite a few people following him. Rumor has it he's a pretty mean customer. Hey, any who calls himself mad dog Kelly probably started the rumors himself. Oh, I never met the gentleman myself but I'd be careful if I were you. No, I can handle him. Sure, look, I'll tell you what I'll do. I give you a couple of horses. That'd be great. You can ride, can't you? Like the wind. Like the wind. Like the wind. Be a good horse. Having trouble? Well, you got a saddle. I suppose you ride better on the saddle, huh. Yeah, I'm a regular Roy Rogers. Show off! Look, want some help? No! Are you sure? Come on, we haven't got all day! I'm coming, I'm coming. Come on, horse, don't be such a schmuck, follow the other horse. Huh, ride like the wind, huh? This isn't the kind of horse I'm used to. The kind you're used to rides around circles and played music. Very funny, very, very droll. Well, not as funny as you on that horse. You should see yourself. Wanna take a rest? No, we don't have enough time! Time? You're talking about time? One day, one way the other is not gonna make any difference. Just get going. What? You wait here. Do I have a choice? Oh, hey! Come on, come on. Get him! Whoo! Whoo! What the fuck? All right! Anybody want to fight? Come on, all of you! You wanna fight? Come on, get off your goddamn bike! We'll see how tough you are! Come on! Come on, come on! Let me go! Let me go! Mad dog. Mad dog. Mad dog? Mad dog. What the hell is going on here? Hey, boss, we're just having a party. Oh, is that right? Why wasn't I invited? Who are you? Harry Trent. Oh, is that right? I'm a tooth fairy. Oh, la di da, la di da, the tooth fairy. La di da. You, come here! I figured... Come here! Ha-hal tooth fairy, right? So, you're Harry Trent, huh? That's right. So, you think you can lick these bunch if I hadn't shown up? What, these pansies? Oh. That's good. Maybe we should paint some flowers on the side of their bikes. You know, Trent? You could be my kind of guy. I doubt it, I've had all my shots. Shit your wit. Hey, baby, poetry, huh. Come on, back to my place, Trent. I'll show you around. Is that yours? No, we're just traveling together. Hey, she killed murdock. That's all right. Now, we got an extra bike for Harry here. Come on, both of you, back to my place. Well, maybe if we get on his good side, he can give us information. Do you think he's got a good side? You sure you can ride that thing? Now, don't tell me like the wind. - Like the wind. Dana told me later that the first she noticed when we entered the building was the sound of generators. You could hear them, throbbing and pounding under the building. Hey! Sure haven't the sound of power being produced in over five years. My attention on the other hand was distracted by something else. Something I hadn't seen in just as long. I didn't have any attention to spare for generators. I was thinking of settling down at mad dog for a nice long stay. This is outrageous. What the hell is your problem? I feel like I've just been taken back 50,000 years to beginning of history. The men here are animals! And the women are treated as toys. Oh, you got it, lady. That's natural order of things around here. In fact, the only thing that don't fit here is you! Ladies, take our guest to your quarters. Put her in some decent clothes. I like these clothes just fine. Thank you. Get out of here, move! Trent, don't you dare just stand there! What do you see in her anyway, Trent? You know what the problem is? She got too much brains. We don't need anything up here. Just down here. Too much brain doesn't make somebody happy. Would've lost for, aren't you? Damn right. Hey, Trent, somebody likes you. Let her try you on or something. Don't tempt me. The best way to give in to temptation is to yield to it. Asked a while. You know, for a fact, that's a good idea. Go ahead and take her. I thought there weren't supposed to be any cars or anything left here? Hey, there's plenty around if you know where to look. It's a world of built of three billion people, babe. There's only a few million that was left at the valley remains. This frog face tried to wreck everything. The job is even too big for them. Believe me, there's plenty to go around if you know where to look. Seems like you're having a good time. That's goddamn time of my life. That's right, for you. Oh, I know, I know, I should be so upset about the billions of dead, right? But no amount of tears are gonna bring us even one of them back. I got my own life to live. I can help. Take off your clothes. Why? So we can rescue you. Don't take fucking my clothes off! Nobody fucking, hey goddamn, what do think? You're tough, huh. We can handle tough. Ladies. Let me out, leave me alone! I'm gonna kill you. We're gonna teach you a little humility before we take you back to Kelly. You can't teach me anything! I never could resist the challenge. Thanks, kid. You know, Trent, with the aliens have done, it swiped the slate clean. We're back to basics. Think these women here are unhappy? Bullshit. I take care of them, I provide for them, and all they gotta do is look nice, and make me feel good. They got me. You know, that's really isn't fair. It's like offering a starving vegetarian a t-bone steak. I can't get my principle straight. Your principle seems pretty straight to me. He's my kind of guy. Work for a big company, made good money. Oh, I even had more, so I cared about just. You know what my company made? They made bombs and guns and tanks. I killed people I never even met. It was easy, it's just that. With company you just say? What difference does it make? It's gone now. Humor me. It's Alpha steinler's outfit. Darovic steinler? Yeah, so what? So, weren't they supposed to have a secret plant somewhere in Richmond? Yeah, it's like a big ant farm under a mountain. Little slide's flogging, streaming in and out. Nobody even tried, even knew. So, how'd you know? 'Cause you're one of the ants. That's right, but not anymore. It's gone, good riddance. Can you take me there? What for? There's something there that I need. There's nothing there that anyone needs. Look, it's really important, you gotta take me there. I don't got to do anything. I like you, pal, but don't push your luck! Hey, your friend's back. How she looks? Better than I expected. What do you think? Why, you! Hey, hold it, hold it! First things first. Boys, we got a new member here. Initiate her. And save a piece for me. Give me a woman. Hey, guys! Wait a minute, guys. All right, guys. Party's over. Stop! Hold it! What's the matter with you? Can't you wit your turn? The chair, put it down! You can't do this! Why not? Because she's my woman. You think so, pal? I didn't get where I am today respecting other people's property. You gonna fight all of us for her? I don't have to. I'll just fight the head guy 'cause he's chicken. Oooh! All right, we fight but around here, we fight for keeps. Move, make room, move! You're just bad as he is! I'll do my own fighting! Come on, be realistic. We can't fight all those guys. Then I'll fight the head man. What do you mean? He's got a hundred pounds on you! All right, he's got a hundred pounds on me too. But at least I got a chance. Oh, you can handle him just like you handled the hook, huh. Aman's gotta do what a man's gotta do. If it looks like I'm losing, run. No chance. If you lose, we go down together. If I lose, you'll go down, all right. Hey, hero, get over here! Ever used one of these? Little tough to shave with, isn't it? Oh, that's real funny. You gotta be grinning from ear to ear in a minute. Before we start, how about going over the rules? Rules, what rules? If you kill me, you take the girl and you go. I kill you, you don't have a clue what happens next. Well, no. How about I win, I get the girl and you owe me a favor. That's stupid! That's it or I don't fight. You gotta fight! No, no deal, I'm not fighting. No, forget about it. I'm gonna get out here if the change the rule. That's it. Wait a minute, wait a minute. Okay, you win. If you kill me, I owe you a favor. That's better. You're good, real good. Yield? What? Yield? What? Yield? All right. All right. Come on, that's fine. Dana, let's go. He cheated you, Kelly. You mention that, he says yield. What the hell is yield? It's embarrassing. Forget about it, come on. Great fight, Trent, great fight. Great fight. Look, I don't know much about neutron-90, Trent. I've heard of it but I never worked on it. Could you take us to it? What for? We don't even know if it'll work in the aliens. We can give it a try. Look, without complete physiological profile, it'll be useless. Look, just take us there and let us worry about it, all right? The place's a little tricky. Why is that? 'Cause the lzags, they're sitting on it. What? Those big tower things they build every place they go, well, they built one right on top of it. They didn't even know what's hidden in there. If they did, they'd have a stroke. The ultimate war machine. They'd go bullshit. Just like to make things very easy. Hey, it makes just a bit impossible. No, not impossible. Are you crazy? The lzags are the only real weapons on this planet. They got blasters, and laser cannons and you're gonna attack with crossbows and slings. Yeah, just like a woman. Wait a minute, wait a minute. You can get us weapons. There are no real weapons. The izags destroyed them all. Oh, like the cars and the fuel refineries, huh? I can get you a few small arms. Even with couple of handguns, we wouldn't stand a chance. You're damn right. But we can't take the facility by force. But maybe, just maybe we can sneak inside. Come on, give me a break, will you? Sneak inside. Oh, why not? 'Cause it will be suicide, that's why. Oh, I see, so you're afraid. I'm not afraid of anything or anyone and get that through your tiny little female brain. Sure, you talk like a big man now, but in the early inspect yard, you'll be cuddling a different tune, right? Nobody talk to me like that, especially not a woman. Let me get my hands on her. I can talk later. Calm down. - No, let him go. Just leave him alone, he's not gonna hurt anybody. Just knock it off, all right, listen. Cut it out! Look, she's a woman, she doesn't know what she's talking about, all right? Don't you stop? You know, I guess you're right. I'm okay, let me go! Boy, she have it going there for a minute. I got you! All right then, come on. Come at me. Too late, too late. Come on, come on. You didn't hear me scream. You did so scream. I did not scream! You did so! - I did not! You did so! - I did not! You did so! - Shut up! Shut up! Can we just act like adults here and just calm down? Listen, we're gonna talk about infiltrating the alien tower. No, you were talking about infiltrating the enemy tower, remember? Yeah, chicken shit here wants nothing to do with it. You know what, Trent, she's right. I don't wanna be around when screamer here turns to jelly. I will not... You will too. Look, can you just take us there to show us where it's at? That's all. I don't know, I don't like the whole idea. Would you like the idea of a slave planet? No, I don't like the idea of human beings having a weapon like this again. Even to be used against the aliens. Yeah, then what? When the aliens are gone, what then? Who next? You don't know, huh? Thought about that myself. I don't know. You know something, Trent? I'll take you there, at dawn. You know what? You guys will never make it alive anyhow. All right, Trent, let's see you break in. You know, maybe there's a blind spot. Let's see if anybody approach you from any angle. We need diversion. Good idea, go ahead and be diversion. Why don't we let ourselves get captured? It was only a suggestion. Trent, 1 got a helpful info for you. There's a secret entrance in the ground plant around the other side. If you can reach it, it's your best bet. Okay, all right. Kelly... Mad dog. Mad dog, give us about five minutes. I haven't got a watch. Here. Take my watch. That's nice. Now, you haven't got a watch. Here, take your watch. Forget about watches, look, just count to 3,000. That'll give us the time to get over the other side and we'll get out bearing straight. Yeah, then what? And pick off one of those guards. Are you crazy? No, that's good. The rest of the sentries will be taken by surprise and then the lone commander decide to see who did it. That's really good then they'll come after me. They don't know you got a gun, they know don't know you have a car. And we make a clean get away while they're looking for some who's on foot here. You know, it's sounds okay but I know there's a catch. Trust me, come on. Can you count to 3,000? Of course, I can, Kelly. Oh, yeah? While making love? One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12. Is that it? Must be. Not very secret to me. Doesn't look too secret to me either. They gotta know about these. What are we gonna do? Probably get back to Kelly and stop him. Up the chances. 2,992. 2,993. 2,999. 3,000. 3,001. Run for it! 3,002. Come on, let's go. Can't you stop? Run, run! Shit! We did it! Holy fuck shit! I'm gonna kill you! Get in the car! My car! You lousy son of a bitches! No more Mr. nice guy! We made it. Where is everybody? I don't know. I don't think they know what they've got here. They've only posted a few total guards. No. Trent. What are you doing here? These fuck-faced bears nailed my car. What kind of place is this? You sure the weapon's here? Christ, Trent, you should be able to trust me, come on. Quick, get inside the door! Come on, Dana! Close, that was close. Okay, where are we? Attention, you are trapped. If you give yourselves, you will be terminated. We must have your answer at once. Hot, huh? Look, that's not funny. Something's going on out there. Something going on in here too. It's getting hot. Yeah, or maybe got angry and maybe they try to burn it down. How much hot it gonna get? I don't know. There's a hell lot of power if you use that thing. All right, listen, we're in the right place, there's gotta be a control around here somewhere that's connected to the neutron-90. So what, Trent? The program we're talking about take months just to plan when you know what your doing which we don't. Your friend is right. I know as much about this device as any man. Probably more than any man now. And I've been working on the program you need for more than a year. Who are you? Hoffenstein. Isaac hoffenstein. Oh, so this is your baby, huh. My name's Kelly, Malcolm Kelly. Malcolm? The name's not familiar. Well, I work in another division. You designed this thing? Not alone but the main concept was mine. My heart just sank right into my snickers. There we were in an empty room. This fruitcake hoffenstein was gonna save the world with an empty room. This is the device you're pinning the hopes of all mankind on. And it's the most terrible killing machine human race has yet perfected. All right, where are the controls? It's totally voice activated and it's useless. Useless? A little over a year ago, I escaped from my alien captors and made my way here. The outside door's impregnable, as you know and there was a supply of food and water. I was left alone and in peace to work the on the problem myself. But no luck? I'm afraid not. It's only a matter of time before they break in. I don't suppose to have any trouble learning how to use it to break down a human physiology. Wait a second, wait a second, I've got it. You know what's wrong with you, hoffenstein? It's that you're a genius. You're too brilliant to look for the simple solution. Meaning what? If you can't form a machine on what you don't know then appropriately, what you do is work backwards. What are you babbling about? Feed the fixed physiological patterns of earth life forms into the machine until it kill everything that's not involved. That's stupid. No, that makes sense. It does? Then why then didn't you think of it? I don't know. I was too busy trying to understand the alien physiology, it never occurred to me to think backwards. That's the price of being a genius, I suppose. And it will work. It would. What do you mean would? In order to do that, I would have to link the neutron-90 with the central computer data bank. So, do it, push them buttons. It's not the question of pushing button. There's a code. Which you don't have, right? Sorry, the Pentagon, you see, didn't want one man to have such power so the code linking the two computers was sort of their secret. Please. Ironically enough, I had convinced them to trust me with the code just prior to the alien attack. It was included in a tape that outline the government policy for the use of the neutron-90 but it was stolen in transit. It never reached here, what? Come on, give it to me. Now, everybody watching? The tape, give me the tape! Here, take it. Here, use it, quickly. This is it? Yes, the missing tape, now use it! Computer. Scan tape for intercomputer link code and activate link with central computer data bank. Good. Now, listen very carefully. I want you to cross correlate the physiological patterns of all life form data to the planet earth, construct a master pattern of earth physiology. How long will that take? Implement! Implementing. Not much time. Move it, they're here! Now! Where are you going? I'm going out to buy some time! How? I don't know! Wait, wait a minute! We're gonna do this together, right? After all these, hell, why not? Your wrecked my goddamn car, you killed my freaking bride! Right behind youl! Just go, I'll cover you! Cover me! Move, move, quickly! Nice shooting, Malcolm! Come on! Here, quick, here! Izags all over the place. Here, quick, come here! Quick, come in here. We're trapped. I believe it's customary to hold hands. You've been pussy cat, you. Activate! Computer. What is it? Get the medical profile on professor Isaac hoffenstein from the company records. Scan the electrocardiogram pattern and program the neutron-90 to terminate it. Just let me a light a cigar for you. You're stupid. Just saved the entire planet. You and your machine here. I hated this thing more than anybody. Right now, I wish it was me. But the future generation... The future generation's gonna need a man like you. Just try to be a little more careful in the future, okay? 10, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one, zero. How long will it be before mankind reaches such a peak of destructive power again? It's up to us to see they never do. This is, in a way, a new beginning. Fresh start. On the ashes of a dead civilization, a new humanity, a better race can emerge where people don't create machine of destruction but live together in peace and Harmony. A world of joy and happiness for all people. A world of peace. It's up to us. So, that's how I saved the world. Are you listening? Hey, kid! Oil oh here with you is like being hypnotized really good but you just won't let it fly you know, what it will be inside excuse me, we keep this cool, all right this is a different you this is it, are you with us too I found out it's better be clear I'm not happy whenever you're near I wish it too I wish you give up here that's your ship and drag your ass outta here
