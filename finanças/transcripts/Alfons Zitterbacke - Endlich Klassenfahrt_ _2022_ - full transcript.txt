ALFONS JITTERBIT CLASS TRIP CHAOS! A long time ago, when I was still a child... so... about three years ago, I dreamed every night of working as an astronaut in space. Strangely enough, in my dreams I was always a total jinx. So... just like in real life. Jitterbit! Yes, that's me. But now I'm all grown up. Well, sort of. There are some downsides though. Sometimes you change quite a lot. Alfons! But now I dream of completely different things. Help! I'm going to fall! -Take my hand. -In my new dreams, I have no pimples, no fear of heights and I'm brave and strong. Alfons. You saved me. I'll be eternally grateful. Alfons! -Alfons! -What... Alfons! Didn't you set your alarm? -What? -Didn't you set your alarm? Of course I did. Crap! My class trip! Alfons, Jack, where are you? Mom's been rather tense for days, as she's going on a trip with her new guy while I'm away. We have to go! The class trip, the vacation! Come on, my boy. We can do this! -What? -Hurry up! Jack's been dating Mom for a year now. My real dad moved out two years ago, as he and Mom argued and he always had to sleep in the tent. Jack has also always been a jinx, like me. Alfons, where are you? I overslept. Be there soon. Should I tell Flickendorf? Hey! Put your phone away. Get a move on. Alfons! Come on, Alfons. Hurry up. Jack, are you okay? I'm fine. Everything's okay. Nothing happened. I'm fine. I'll drive. No. You stay here and call a doctor. I'll be right back. Okay. But... please! -Go easy on the engine. -Yes. -Bye, Alfons. -Bye, Jack. -Bye. -Bye. Isn't it time you got an eco-friendly electric car? Alfons! That actually works? So there it was again... the bitter reality. And I, the unluckiest person of all time, am now late for my own class trip. Great... Benni says Flickendorf won't wait for us. We're almost there! Your teacher's nuts. He has to wait. If we miss the bus, then my vacation will be ruined too. We're nearly there. Is Alfons really not coming? Only if we're really unlucky. Benni says Flickendorf is glad we'll miss it. We won't miss it. Yep. Mr. Bus Driver, do your job. Alfons, we're leaving now. -Oh no! -Hold on. Have you lost your mind? Phew! That was close. But we made it. You nearly caused an accident. Mr. Flickendorf was our teacher. He didn't like me and I didn't like him. -Ms. Hoffmann, thank God! -Hi. Ms. Hoffmann is our new teacher. Which is great, as I like her and she seems to like me too. We're so sorry. We didn't hear the alarm. And then traffic was so trafficky. And luckily for us... I mean, for Alfons... -We made it. -Mom! -What is it, dear? -Nothing. It's okay. We're glad Alfons will be joining us. We'll call as soon as he does something. So probably within the next hour. You'll see for yourself. Well, then. Come on, Alfons. Get in. -Mrs. Jitterbit, enjoy your vacation. -Thanks. Call if anything happens. Hope nothing happens, as we'll be away too. We're always there for you. Just a little less over the next few days. Okay? -Mom, this is so embarrassing. -I love you, darling. Bye. -Bye! -Drive. Cool pants, darling. Check it out. The idiot's wearing his pajamas. -Come on, then. -Oh no. -Jitterbit, go. -Go sit down. Everyone knows that some moments seem to last longer than others. But this moment just seemed to last forever. Benni's been my best friend and advisor for years. -Do you also want to be an astronaut? -No. A lawyer. Why? Emilia's been my friend for years. -Well, we're pals. -Morning. Kung Fu! - She wants to be a photographer. -That was close. Hey. Yeah. So? Everything okay? I suddenly remembered I'd just saved Leonie in a dream. Yes, everything's great. Can the young man with the nice pajamas sit down? I'd like to go. Is this for real? Oh man! I specifically requested a new, modern bus. But what did this deaf idiot hear me say? "No new modern bus." Good luck. I'm glad you made it. -Bless you. -Thank you. It's not contagious. Just hay fever. Chips? Leonie only joined our class two weeks ago. I really like her, because she always looks at me in a nice way. What are you thinking about? Nothing. Jitterbit always messes up and thinks of nothing. Ha, ha. That was hilarious, Nico. Just ignore him. That's Nico. He was an idiot back then, and things haven't changed. Just like his minions, Bodo and Frodo. Who's a loser who has a quirk? Alfons, Alfons Jitterbit While we wait, we should do something constructive. -What happens after our class trip? -We go to school. Party, party, party! Yes, that too. Calm down. I meant the class representative elections. -I'll nominate you. -No, I can't! -Come on. Yes, you can. -I can't. -You can. -I've never done it before. -I nominate Leonie. -No! Too late. Right. Okay, yes. I accept. Yeah? That's great! We need to have a word. Perfect. Who, other than Leonie, would like to be class representative? No one. Don't forget that, in addition to the class representative, we'll also choose a vice class representative. That means you won't be working alone, but often together. I really don't want to be class representative, but if it means spending time with Leonie, then that's great. -Come on. -No. -Who'd be up for it? -Go on. -Come on. You can do it. -Come on, people. -Me! -What? -Alfons? -I'd like to be class represent... -Representa-dork! -Representative. -Alfons... -Great! Are you crazy? Do you even know that means? Yes, I do. Great. So now we've got two. But we still need more. Come on. Go for it. Who else would like to be a candidate for this position? -Anyone? -I do. I'd like to be class representative. Oh, Nico! I've noted it down. Great. I think we're ready to go. If you're still interested, let me know. Thank you! Here we go, dude! Here we go! Here we go! Here we go! Here we go! Are you okay? Excuse me. Could we make a quick stop? Listen up, everyone! We're making a quick pee stop, okay? Pee stop! Pee stop! Pee stop! You okay? -Coming? -I just need to put my jeans on. Alfons... -What is it? -Your pants. -Crap! -I was looking for that candy bar. Oh shit. Jitterbit pooped his pants. -Quick, Frodo. Take a video of it. -Quick! And he wants to be class representative? Better than you being one. As if you could even be one. Even Bodo's hamster has better chances at being picked. -True. -Oh yeah? Of course. But I've figured out why you're doing this. And why is that? "Oh, Leonie! I'll never forget you. Oh, kiss me, Leonie!" -What are you talking about, dude? -It's obvious you like her. That's why you want to be class representative. Bet if she went to a knitting class, you'd join that too, right? Don't you get that you don't stand a chance? And definitely not against me. Against you? What are you talking about? And why wouldn't I stand a chance, huh? Because you're a moron. And everyone in our class agrees. Why won't you finally accept it? -I'm not a moron! -Are so. Just look at you, with your poopy pajama pants. You're a loser and women aren't into that. Especially not in our class. -Fact! -Fact! He's such a loser. Oh no! Wow. Those are your mom's things, aren't they? This is so annoying! You saw I'd just picked up my coffee at that moment. If I hadn't braked, we would've caused a bad accident. Yeah, and why is that? Because you wanted to drive, despite your bad foot. And if you'd been driving like a normal person, then... No! This can't be happening. Jack! Yes? Did you put both cases in the trunk earlier? Of course I did, darling. Why? Could it be that you stuck Alfons' luggage tag on my suitcase? We have to go find Alfons. HOLIDAY PARK Everyone get off the bus. Chop, chop. What kind of junkyard is this? Is this the right address? It looked better online. Hello? Hello? Hello? What? Are you... Ms. Hilde Buck? Yes. It's you. Hi. The hut for the lasses is the down, down hut. Eight's the number. -And the boys are... -What is she saying? The boys get this crappy hut. The girls get the nice new one. No wriggling in the other huts. They're bespoken for another class. We can't enter the other huts, as another class has rented them. Go on. Skedaddle. I'm busy, you know. Got all that? I didn't understand that either. Very friendly. So now for the important things. I have the list where you're sleeping. No whining. And no swapping. Let's meet in rec room the in half an hour. -I get the bed by the window. -Oh yeah? Take my backpack. What a dump. Wow! What's that stench? You really are skunks. It's really... something. -Disgusting. -Let's get out of here. Hey, wait! Hey, Alfons. I'll go find the showers. Oh man. I'd like to put on a fresh t-shirt too. Damn it. Nothing but women's stuff. Great packing, Jitterbit. I knew it. You sweet little darling. Give me that. Nico! Just leave Alfons alone. It's bad enough that he took his mom's suitcase by mistake. Oh, I get it now. Poor boy. You have to wear your mom's stuff now. Looking forward to your sexy nightgown tonight. Your pajama bottoms this morning were really nice. But I have an idea how you can restore your honor, Jitterbit. I bet you won't be able to kiss Leonie during the trip and become her boyfriend. I... I don't even want to be Leonie's boyfriend! That's only sort of true. You're backing out as you don't stand a chance. Unfortunately, that's completely true. You're just talking nonsense. If I wanted to, then I definitely could. And that... is a complete lie. All right. If Leonie becomes your girlfriend by the end of the trip, kissing, holding hands and all that stuff, then I'll do everything you want for one day. Whatever it may be. But if I win, and Leonie becomes my girlfriend, then you'll do everything I want for one day. Okay? Don't do it, Alfons. He'll make you tell Flickendorf that he's an idiot and you'll be expelled. Listen to your advisor and future lawyer. Oh... One more thing. The bet stays between us. Otherwise Leonie will pretend to be your girlfriend out of pity. You're nuts. If you win, then me and my boys will never bully you again, So what's it going to be? Are you a man or a mouse? Alfons! Why won't you just listen to me for once? Will you still vote for me for class representative? Damn it. I can lend you a t-shirt if you want. Thanks. That would be really cool. Hopefully your mom won't be mad at you. What... what else am I supposed to do? These rhinestones won't cut it and her clothes don't suit me. Why do you always have such weird t-shirts? They're for the party. They look really cool on me. No, no, no! Mom! You said you'd pick me up after the class trip. I don't want to live with Grandpa. I want be with you in Dresden! Mom! Alfie, darling! How are you? Hello, Mom. I'm fine. And you? Yes... great. Everything's just fine here. Yes, of course I noticed that too. Someone must've mixed up the luggage tag. Yeah, yeah. Our Jack. Listen up. You can use anything you want. Just not my new jeans, okay? The ones with the rhinestones. They were expensive. Okay? Did you get that? Alfons? Okay? Yes, of course, Mom. Good. We'll try to come by tomorrow to swap suitcases. Have fun! I love you, darling. Bye-bye. Yes! Yes! Jitterbit, don't even try it. Leonie! -Sorry! I didn't mean to do that. -Great tactic. I'm so sorry, Leonie. I'm such a jinx. You're such an idiot. How are you feeling? Let go of me. -Loser. -It was my fault. Besides, I was the one who was jinxed, not you, right? Hey! Such things happen. It's a pretty dangerous game. Which you're going to lose now. Let them have it. Yes! Pretty tasty. Not bad. There were some things that I didn't like. And suddenly, I realized I had to act immediately and present my plans as class representative to Leonie and my future voters. Dear classmates... May I have your attention? I... Unfortunately, I had no plan as to what my plans were. I'm of the opinion that we should... be more mindful of the environment. We live in a throwaway society. -Alfons, what are you doing? -Just a sec. I'm of the opinion that we should... stop using paper plates, as they'll just be thrown away. If we use real plates and cutlery. There will be no waste. Who's with me? I am. But only if you do all the washing up afterwards -In that case, I'm also in. -Me too. Great idea, Alfons. -No paper cup -And then he'd just shut up Alfons, Alfons, Jitterpaper -That's enough, Nico. -Good call, Nico. Mom! Mommy. Of course, I had to see my campaign pledge through. Set a good example. Crap. It was nothing but pure crap. Great. Even you guys are partying while I'm toiling here. What's going on? I have no idea. What are they doing here? That's what. -"Leonie for class representative." -"Use deodorant. Wash your hands." What's going on? -Look. -Scotch tape. We'll get revenge. Benni. Benni! -What's up? -You're singing out loud again. Oh, sorry. I didn't realize. I know. Now switch that off, please. Woah. Hey. -How can anyone sleep with that? -Benni can. Shut up, Jitterbit. Oh man. -Well? Sleep well? -Slept great, thanks. You guys didn't? Listen up, everyone. We've come up with two great activities for you today. All I'll say is, hope you brought your swim trunks. Oh God, swimming. Your bikini. Ha, ha. Very funny. Don't worry. I brought extra swim trunks. -Where's the pool? -Just follow your nose. It's just three miles from here. The pool is called the Baltic Sea. So we're going by bus then. I'm afraid we're not. -It's so beautiful. -Look! So pretty. -Are you okay? -No. Nature isn't really my thing. I'd rather we'd gone on a nice city trip. -What did you do to your hair? -Nothing. It's because of the humidity. I spy with my little eye... Is it a class representative? No, it's that moron Jitterpoop. -Loser. -Jitterpoop I told you. Going for class representative and the stupid bet were bad ideas. What bet? No idea what he's talking about. Most of the time, he doesn't either. -Beautiful, isn't it? -Our swimming pool. -I've got a stone... -Oops. -Sorry. -Hey! Jitterbit. Were you trying to push me? -What? -Watch it, or you're going home. Just look at this view. Our beach is right down there. Are you okay? No. Nothing's okay, if it's higher than two or three yards. You're right. I forgot about that. Let's go down to the beach. You have one hour, then we'll continue on. I much preferred it down here on the beach. Emilia was being a photo reporter again, but without Nico it would've been a great day. Jitterpoop. What are you looking at? Get lost, loser. He's such an idiot. -Howdy there! How are you? -Good. Our plan for today. Has anyone ever been in a zorbing competition? Yes, I have. A couple of times. -I always won. -Look forward to that. This can't be happening. Seems Nico wants to show me up in front of Leonie and the whole class. Take a good look around. It's safe. The fences are padded, as is the zorbing ball. We'll start the first round in five minutes, okay? -Mr. Zorbing? -Yes? I need to check everything out first before I allow... I knew I had to act fast and come up with something really good. But what? You go in there. That's it. That's it. A long, pointy nail. One small jab for Nico's ball, one giant win for humanity, or rather, for me. Alfons! Alfons! Alfons! Jitterbit! Goddamn it! Yes! Yes! Jitterbit! Yes! Going a bit fast, isn't he? -The gate is opening. -The gate's open. The gate! Help! The gate! -Oh man. No! -Jitterbit! -Stop! -Help! -Help! -I'm so sorry! -Jitterbit! -Stop! I didn't mean for this to happen! Sorry, Mr. Flickendorf! Watch out! So sorry! Damn it. Damn it. Damn it! Oh my God! Help! Jitterbit... Flickendorf yelled that he should call my parents right away. And that the bust zorbing ball would be expensive to replace. And then he just said... I feel sick. This year's zorbing competition winner is... -Nico! -Yeah, man! -Want to try some too? -Yes, please. Hey. Smells great. You weren't sent home after all? No. Not yet. I'm glad. What's the bet with Nico? I'll tell you later. So... Nearly ready. -Check this out. -Wow. Well, that was close. I'd have gone all the way to the floor. Can I help you? And by "you", I mean both of you. Yes. Just hold the door open for us. But be very careful, okay? Alfons? Yes, Benni? Why can't we tell Emilia about the bet? Because she'd just tell Leonie and then... she'd just pretend to be my girlfriend out of pity... so I can win the bet. True. That makes sense. Maybe she'd do it out of pity. Benni snores like a rhino, man. I've noticed. Have you seen my toothpaste? No, man. Mine is gone too. Just use that one. What is this? "Super strong denture glue. Sets in seconds and lasts for hours." It's Flickendorf's. Ew. For his loose teeth? We can't let them get away with it this time. Yes, bro! Got any acts of revenge in mind? I definitely do. If only I can get this stuff off again. Ha, ha. Very funny. We'll get revenge! Speaking of revenge... Dude, where did you find those? Where do you usually find them? Huh? What? Cockroaches? Did you dig them out from some poop? They usually hang out in kitchens. Oh! In the kitchen. I see. That's okay then. We can set them free in the girls' room. Are you serious? Cool idea, bro. Very cool! No! Ew! Cockroaches! How did they get in here? Where did they come from? Huh? I just spoke to some concerned parents, who don't want their loved ones to continue living in a pest-infested summer camp. Pests? Cockroaches ain't pests. That's nonsense. Do as you desire. Come along, you ox. Got all that? But I still get all the dough! So... I'm afraid we'll be heading back home now. No. Wait a sec. Everything here's booked out, but a friend's friend's grandpa owns a big old villa in the Harz and we can stay there. -Great. -Did you know the Harz region is great for hiking? And climbing. It has really high cliffs. I think it'll be really cool. This is just a nightmare. And it's all your fault. Pack your stuff. Make it quick. The bus will be here in 20 minutes. Not another bus trip... No, Mom. No. I really don't get it. - Hello, Alfie. How are you? -Bye. Hello, Mom. Yeah, I'm okay. And you? Yeah, everything's great. We'll come by this afternoon to swap suitcases. Then we can each have our own clothes. You'll like that too. Yeah, Mom. We're going to go climbing in the Harz soon. What? But that's a catastrophe! I mean, I really need my... You surely need your things. But we're setting off in ten minutes. What? You're leaving in ten minutes? Well, we definitely won't be there by then. We're in the middle of nowhere driving really slowly. Really slowly... That was fast! Welcome! -Are you Max Holledau? -No, I'm Fred. But the one over there who never listens is Max. Come. -I'm going in. -Okay. -Oh... -Yes, "oh". -Sorry, Fred. -Now. Hey. Welcome! I'm glad you're here. You'll have a great time here. Will you be going on a climbing tour? -If you join us. -We'll see. The storm's approaching! Come inside. Stick with your original room distribution, okay? See you in the dining room. Hey, everyone! Quiet, please! You have some free time after dinner. Speaking of free time... Please don't use the plastic toilet in front of the mansion. It doesn't belong to us. And we've already got enough issues with the owner. Why have you got issues with the owner? Because he doesn't want me to set up a meeting place for actors, musicians and artists here, who need help, as many of them have fallen on hard times in recent years. What would life be without art and music? Nothing. Listen up, folks. Tomorrow you'll be taught professional rope, climbing and knotting techniques. And then you'll climb a very high cliff with your helmets, ropes, snap hooks. All the way up. -Yeah! -That's awesome! That's really shit. You don't need to climb that high. -Are you okay? -No, I'm definitely not okay. It's too high and too steep and too wobbly. Keep in mind we're only here because of you. Come on, eggheads. Get a move on. Hey! Bodo, Frodo. I saw that. Look. He's just doing it to annoy me. Well, maybe he's doing it to win the bet. Or maybe he really does think she's nice. Or he has a crush on her. Or she has a crush on him. But who cares? Unless you have a crush on Leonie. Could you stop with all your crush nonsense? I... -Come on, loser. -He's such a scaredy cat. -Loser. -You're too slow. Nice and slowly now, Alfons. Want to stop for a moment? You have to fight against your fear. Imagine that we're a yard above a meadow. Okay? One yard. Everyone, take cover! 15 minute snack break! Time starts now! Alfons is scared of heights. It's so embarrassing. He's such a loser. Folks, there you are! I thought you wanted to go climbing. I can't and don't want to climb, just to be laughed at again. You don't have to climb all the way up. One or two meters will do. And I could hold your belay rope if you want. Me and only me. I've done it about... 100 times before. You can trust me. Think about it. You can do it. What's that? That? That's the old funicular. For rocks and stuff. I used to use it when I had to rush to catch my train. It saved me an hour's journey. But it's completely broken now. You can't even touch it now. It would fall apart. That's a tall tale, man. Hey! No, it's not a tall tale. Just take my word for it and stay away from there. So go straight ahead and you'll reach the climbing rock. Can you find your way back without me? -Of course. -Come on then. Time to climb. Hi, I'm Maxi and I'm in charge of your safety. I've been climbing since I was five. I'll show you some of the basics. Wow. That's really high. You have to be good with heights. I'll get going then. This is a roping-up knot. Roping up means attaching the rope to the harness so that you're secure. This knot is a figure eight. You can tell because it looks like an eight. It's important to keep it neatly threaded with the strands running parallel. -Any idea what a belay partner is? -Yes, I do. A partner that's always late. -What? -Yes. I'd have said the same thing. No, that's a delayed partner. This is something completely different. You can see it here. A belay partner regulates the length of the climber's rope, securing it, even if the climber falls. Dude! That's insane. As you can see, nothing can happen to you. Let's go. Alfons and Nico are up first. - Oh, great. -Go find shoes and harnesses. This is a huge nightmare. But I can't chicken out in front of everyone. Well, then, Jitterbit. The first to reach the top, wins. -It's not a competition. -Exactly. Learn how to do it properly right. Let's go. -Nice and slowly. -Only go as high as you want. Okay. Off you go. Come on, Nico! Come on, Alfons. Go! You can do it. Come on, Alfons! Go! Go for it! -You can do it! -Nico! Nico! Come on! Hey! Quieten down, folks. I told you it's not a competition. Secure your foot! It's okay. Nice and easy now. Come on, Alfons. -You're doing great, Alfons. -You've got it! Come on! Okay, that's... That... that was great. I'd... like to come down now. Okay. That was great for your first time. Slowly push yourself away from the rock. Concentrate and go slowly. -No stress... -I can't do it! That's true. You can't ever do anything. You're a lame duck. Nico, that's enough! Alfons, listen to me. You can do it, okay? Trust me. Take a deep breath. Okay. Nice and slow... I've got you. Stop laughing. -You can do it. -I've got you. That's it. Great. Push your feet against the rock. Come on, Alfons. Don't let it get to you. Great. See? Great. -You did great! - I actually survived the terror. And I thought that maybe I was no longer a jinx. Rock slide! Alfons, watch out! Alfons, watch out! Dude, what the... Alfons? You can't leave me now! I have to give the kiss of life. To save you. I'm afraid I have to give him the kiss of life. Luckily, I did a first aid course and I always have a hygienic face mask with me. What? No! I feel... dizzy. Alfons! Face mask! I slept for 14 hours. When I woke up, everyone was gone. Except for Max. Hey. Are you feeling better? Yeah, I'm okay. What are you doing there? It's one of Fred's old rope tricks. If you want to climb but don't have a harness. I'm definitely never going to climb again. Where are the others? They've been out for a while, but you should be glad you didn't join them. Say... are those pants in fashion in the city? No, there was... a small accident. A small accident? Well... I've got plenty of clothes. I could lend you some. -That would be great. -Max? What are you doing here? For some it's more important to make a lot of money than to help other people. The man who wants to throw us out of here and turn this mansion into a luxury hotel for the rich bigwigs has a cold heart. A sick heart. In order to make us leave, he put the plastic toilet in front of our door. And he uses it every day just to show me that he can do whatever he wants. Next week he wants to start building a high-rise right outside. That's... That's totally unfair. Here. Try these on. -That's great. Thanks. -No worries. First chord is A minor. Put your finger up there. Like this. Hey. -Hey. -Did you get your suitcase? No. Max was nice enough to lend me some stuff. Cool. So? How are you feeling? I'm fine. Did you have fun? It was nothing special. I'd rather have stayed here. I might just say I'm sick tomorrow. -Where are the others? -They're on their way. -Dude! Cool set of wheels. -Awesome. That hummer must have at least 400 hp. What a lowlife. I can hardly breathe with him stinking up the place with his fumes. What a cool car. As future class representative, eco-activist and climate rescuer, I knew that the time had come to take decisive action. I know who that guy is. He only does that to annoy everyone here. To intimidate Fred. But he's gone too far. It's enough. I'm going to switch off his filthy car's engine and talk to him. Be careful! How do I turn this stupid thing off? What's that thing? Wait. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop! Oh crap. Who did that? -Who the hell did that? -What's going on? That guy kept his engine running the whole time! Alfons just wanted to turn it off. It... It was an accident. I'll show you what an accident it. I'll stuff you down the toilet. There will be no stuffing. And if there is, then I'll do it. This is none of your business, bozo. You broken garden gnome. -You little squirt. -Watch your tone, mister! Flickendorf and the guy were really yelling. Not in front of the kids! We could... And then something strange happened. You... you are... You.. you are... It must be cardiac arrest! Clearly. Fred took him to the hospital, saving his life. Come on. Up you get. Let's go to the hospital in your stinky car. Plus my actions scored points with Leonie, which Nico wasn't too happy about, unlike me. You don't see me the way I do, do you? You don't want to be with me As much as I want to be with you, do you? Be my quiet partner in crime I don't know the reason why The only reason I'm staying is you Tell me... Tell me about your world Look! A shooting star. Make a wish. I will. That's Saturn. The one with the ring around it. Hey! How's it going? He's the big guy who acts like he's the big hero around here. -What he did was pretty cool. -Well... Jitterbit really got lucky this time. -But he only did it for one reason. -Shut up, Nico. -What do you mean? -It's simple. Alfons pretended to be a hero to win a bet against me. You're such a jerk! You said we'd to keep it a secret. Stop right there. What was meant to be a secret? And what was that about a bet? Yeah, I'd also like to know. Don't you dare, dude. Alfons made a bet that he'd be able to make you his girlfriend during the trip. With kissing, holding hands and all the rest. Wh... What? That's a lie... -That's not how I said it. -Oh, it's not, is it? -But you admit you made the stupid bet? -Yes, I... I mean, no. -It... sounded different... -What's wrong with you? That's so stupid of you! It was the other way round. Nico suggested it. You're both disgusting! I don't want anything to do with you! Let's get out of here. I just... Yeah... I just did that too. -This is all just so shitty. -Yes, you're right. But you know what, Alfons? I recently read an article that women like letters. So maybe you should write Leonie a short letter. Or a long one. Well... Good night. Good night. "Dear Leonie, I'm sorry everything came across so wrong and stupid. The stupid bet only came about because Nico unfortunately found out that I really... really... well... like you. And because..." This is bad. This is so embarrassing! Delete! What? "Sent"? No! Crap! Sent by accident. Doesn't matter! It's done now. "I'm really mad and kind of sad that everything came across so stupid and weird. I'm really sorry. Sorry. I can be a real idiot sometimes. Lots of love, Alfons." Go on then. Answer him. "You're right." "You're right. You really can be an idiot sometimes. Good... nite. Good nite." Oh. "Good night." "Love, Leonie." -Sleep well. -Good night. Oh no. Not again. Benni! Hey, girls. Are we cool? Morning, everyone. Good morning. Good morning. Max and I have to finish painting today. Which means we can't cook for 20 people as well. I understand. Then... Perhaps it might be best if Alfons stayed here. To help out in the kitchen? So you can make up for some of your recent deeds. -Okay. -It's too much for one person. He needs a few helping hands. Then you can pick someone to help you. I pick Benn... Benni? What's today's activity? We were going to go on a hike. Five miles... I'll help Alfons. You can't let your best friend down. -And we have to go on a hike? -No. As I was saying, before Benni interrupted me, we were going to go on a hike, but the plan's changed. We'll be taking a boat to the closest town and go to the cinema. -We're leaving in ten minutes. -What? Jitterbit. Have fun in the kitchen, loser. See you later. -This is so unfair. -It sure is. Here's the stove. On, off. Refrigerator, spice rack, pantry. -What are you making? -I thought we were helping. I can make macaroni with tomato sauce. Well, that's great. We have plenty of that here. Salt and pepper are there. But don't use the chili. -Why not? -Just don't. The aprons and hats are over there. I have to work now. Oh, and if you need me, just shout. Okay. Hey, we actually have half the day before we have to start. -What should we do? -We've got the entire place to ourselves! Let's go check it out. Where's the music coming from? From the wardrobe? -Oh. Sorry. -Sorry. What are you doing down there? Well, this is the most inspiring room in the entire mansion. Could you please close the door? I need to work. Oh yes. Of course. Sorry. Whatever. Blitz chess. Yes! But let's change sides this time. Alfons, I think we should make a start. Let's go! -Hey! -"Seagull macaroni. Contains egg. Best before November 1989." -That stuff lasts forever. -Okay. So what now? First, we make the sauce. Where do they keep the can opener? Not here. That's a great can opener. Hey! It has to cook for a bit. So what do we do now? Ping-pong rematch? Okay. -Wait. Do you smell something? -Yes. Your defeat. No, I'm being serious. It stinks. -Crap. -No, no, no! No! Crap! Hungry! Hungry! The window. Hungry! Hungry! No! Quick, they're coming. Hungry! -So. Salvaged. -You really think so? It still smells funny. -Yeah, but it still needs salt. -True. How much shall we add? I don't know. A little bit. Hey, boys! You scared me there. Smells funky in here. -How was the film? -You didn't miss much. It was a film with warmth and emotions. -Need any help? -Yeah, go away and let us finish. I can't wait to try it. Come. Try it. Oh là là . Scrumptious. But there's some dust... or pepper... in the air. Benni. Sorry. Food! Food! Food! Food! Come. Give me some. Come on. Pass them over. Careful. Okay. Looks like dumbass stew with jitter-eel pie. -Thanks. -Mmm. Looks delicious. Well, then. Enjoy your meal. Wait! Let's have an eating contest! First to finish wins! Three, two, one! What is this? -Dude! -That's way too much. -That's... -Alfons! -I've been poisoned. -It's too spicy. Alfons, what did you put in it? Come on. It can't taste that bad. -Chili! -There's a ton of chili in this! You did it on purpose, Jitterbit. No, I didn't! Great job, dude. Now you've poisoned your entire class too! Alfons, I think I'll go now and clean the kitchen. What? Benni! Hey, Jitterbit. This is for you. Enjoy you meal! Jitterbit! This trip is now over for you! Sometimes you do things that you regret that very same moment. But then the moment is over and life rushes on relentlessly. It feels like you're falling. This was the last straw. Your parents will pick you up tomorrow. I'll go call them. And I'm also going to tell them that you have to leave our school. And now clean this mess up and scrub everything. Everyone else, get out of here! Now! I... I don't want to live with Grandpa anymore. Why can't I come to your place? No, now you listen to me. I don't care what your boyfriend wants. I... I'm coming. Bye! It's a real mess in here. Nico's such a coward. He started it. He's a total loser. "I can rap. I'm so great." "Hey! Look at me with my cool phone." "Hey, Bodo, Frodo. Carry my backpack, you slaves." MY LOCATION TO DRESDEN That's the old funicular. I used it when I had to rush to catch my train. It saved me an hour's journey. And now? What happens now? Yeah... My mom and her boyfriend will cut short their vacation and come pick me up tomorrow. -But... the food thing entirely was... -An accident? But, bro... Wrong adverb. "Truly was an accident." Yeah, you're right. I apologize again. I need to get back to it now. Okay. Where's the cleaning stuff? Benni's doing the kitchen. Over there. But why? Think we're only here to gossip about Nico? Plus class representatives need a helping hand. What's going on? Get to work. Care for a walk to the trash can? Sounds romantic. About having messed things up... I'm really sorry. Yeah, it was dumb. But I believe when you say it wasn't your idea. Plus I know what it's like to go down the wrong track. I used to be the class jinx. -What? You? -Yes! Really. I've been expelled three times. What for? Well, I was always fidgeting and fooling around and annoying the teachers. And I also blew up the chemistry room once. An accident, of course. -No way! -Yes way! -No! -Yes! I did the exact same thing. Now I know why I liked you from the start. Yes, we're pretty similar in some ways. I can feel that our souls are connected. What are you doing? None of your business. Benni. Benni. What? -Emilia, Leonie... -What's the matter? -I think Nico ran off. -What? His backpack isn't there either. -I think I know where he's heading. -Me too. Let's meet downstairs, okay? Nico said his mother lives with her new guy in Dresden. He doesn't want Nico to live there. -That's so mean! -Why doesn't he want him there? He said it would destroy their relationship. -I don't get it. -And neither does Nico. Anyway, he can't stand it at his grandpa's, as all he does is nag him. I think that's why he wants to go to his mother in Dresden. What? On foot? That's impossible. There's a station in the valley. He might get a train there. But that's seven miles away, through the woods. What if Nico plans to take the funicular there? Max said it goes down to the valley. Yes, but Max also said that it's really dangerous. -Nico isn't that stupid. -Well... Okay. Emilia and I will go to the funicular. You go the normal way. And if you find him, call the others right away. -Okay. -Come. Oh no. Nico. What are you doing? -Why are you here? Go away, Jitterbit! -You know it's dangerous. Nico stop that nonsense and come here. You're also here? Great. Take a nice farewell picture of me. That way you can laugh at me. -Nico, stop it! -Bye, Jitterbit. I won't miss you one bit. Nico! Oh man! Shit! Shit! Help! Oh man. Help! Shit! Help me! Damn it. Pull me up, Jitterbit! Benni! He's hanging from the funicular rope! Hurry! It's about to break! Fuck. Shit! -Stop wriggling. You'll make it worse! -Alfons, help me! Drop your backpack to lessen the weight! And then... I can help you! How? I don't know! I need something A rope, a snap hook. Anything! I don't know! Goddamn it! Fuck! Damn it! Pull me up, Jitterbit! Yes, I know what to do! Alfons, help me! -I have to go there. -You can't! -I'll have to! -Help! Help! Alfons! -Take this. -What for? You're my belay partner. Okay. -Tighter. -Do something! Do something! Loosen the rope. Loosen it more! I need to get closer to him! I can't! The rope's too short! -Grab my hand! -I can't let go. Come on. Take my hand. -Take my hand! Do it! -I can't. Yes, you can. You can do it! Take my hand. Trust me! Come on, Nico! You can do it! Wanna bet? I bet you can do it and that you'll win the bet! Or would you rather lose? Come on then! Accept my bet. Now! Alfons! Over here! Hurry! Come on, man. You can do it! Take my hand, now! Do it! Now! -Pull us up! -Come on! -Pull! -Come on. Pull. -Give me some. -Hold him tight. Pull! Pull! -Come on! Pull! -Pull! Come on! Pull! -Pull! -Pull! -Pull! Hurry! -Come on! -Pull! -Come on! Alfons! -Come on! -Pull! Hurry! Come on! Pull! Pull! Keep pulling. Come on! Come here. Are you okay? Thank you. Thank you. Jitterbit, that was... very, very... brave. Oh God. I feel sick. No one wanted to go back to bed after that. Leonie made waffles for everyone again. I helped her. Flickendorf allowed me to go home with the others. -And Nico and I finally buried the hatchet. -Wait! And I liked my classmates and they liked me. Thanks. - Nothing could go wrong now. -Alfons! Smile! Wow! Thank you. -You got lucky there, once again. -That's right. Thanks to you. Know what I like about you? You mean other than the fact that I'm really cool? Yeah. That's exactly why I like you. You make me laugh so much at your antics. Damn, damn, damn! Damn! I nearly forgot. -What is it? -Oh, Mrs. Jitterbit! It's Flickendorf. Mr. Flickendorf, this is a really bad time. We're close, but thanks to your call, we'll probably be late now. No, you no longer need to come. What? I don't understand. You're not going to believe this, but Alfons acted heroically this morning. It won't last long, so enjoy this brief moment of joy and have a lovely vacation, okay? -Vacation? - Bye! What was that about? Alfons' teacher said we no longer need to pick him up. -Why? -Well, because... Because Alfons... acted heroically. -What? -Yes. But I already knew that. Okay then. What now? What are you doing? I just wanted to say... that I love you. I love you too. Oh man. We forgot all about your stupid bet. What? Oh right... We need to hold hands too. You won without even having to cheat. Congratulations. Come on then. Come! Nico's mom came and said she'd finally broken up with her stupid boyfriend, so she could live with Nico again. Oh yeah! The class representative election took place. But I didn't need any of that anymore and withdrew my candidacy. And guess who applied last minute and was elected along with Leonie. And there was one more surprise. Emilia decided to be a singer and soon after Max moved in with her and they played together day and night. And Flickendorf and Ms. Hoffmann suddenly got along really well. That evening Kemal discovered he wanted to be a DJ. And Bodo and Frodo wanted to become dancers. Oh well. I later found out that the heart attack man decided to put all his money into Fred's artists' club. Which is great. The only thing that was a slightly bad was the moment my mom looked in her suitcase Alfons! Who did that? Oh my God! Skedaddle. I'm busy, you know. Subtitles: G.
