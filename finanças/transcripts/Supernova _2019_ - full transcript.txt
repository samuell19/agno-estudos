Nothing ever happens. Come on, kid... What? I like to get some action. Are you always so calm, officer? Get your hat right. Get down to work, Mr Relaxed. Off you go. Morning. Officer Makowski, District Police. - Move your vehicles out of the way. - Sure. Move your vehicle, please. Thank you. Block the road, I'll go see the driver. - What's the status? - We need backup. Piotrek! Paweł! Wake up! We need help! - 911, what's your emergency? - 37 here. We need an ambulance. Bożena? Do we have a free unit? For that accident. All right. It's on its way. Who's the driver? - We're from that car. - We just came here. We saw the ambulance and the car, we wanted to help. But there's nobody there. It's empty. Can you confirm that? We stopped behind him. We're going to my grandma's. 37 here. We need more men. Was I supposed to stay? That's every tabloid's wet dream. I don't know if they're alive. I think one of them is dead. Don't fucking yell at me! Remember who is covering for me? No, nobody saw me. It's the middle of nowhere. Finally! No, I haven't called the boss. You're the one to call in those situations, right? What do you mean, no? Hello? Fuck! Paweł! - What's the status? - Help me! - Give her hydroxyzine. - Save my kids! - Save my kids! - Easy. There. Easy. Calm down. Easy. It's all right. How is she?

Run those plates for me. - What is it? - A hit-and-run. Really? - Did you see what happened? - No, they did. - Can you describe the driver? - Those little kids... - He killed them and ran! - Calm down. Continue. - I saw him. - You did? - A young guy. - Calm down, will you? - Calm down. - Continue. About 30. A fancy-schmancy type. - I called after him, but he run away. - That way? Yeah, that way. - Right, Bożena? - Those poor kids... - Poor little babies... - Calm down. Come on, stop crying. Where are you? - Almost there. - Okay. Park on the other side. Okay. You need more sleep, princess? We all wake up early here. You'll get used to it. Eyes on the road. Another police car? Why so many? One here, one over there. Hey, doll face! What do we have? A hit-and-run. Tough shit. Any roadkill? Listen... We gotta find him. Find who? - We're not waiting for the old man? - Base, copy. What is it? They can't find the Audi. Wait for the info. All right. Hey! What are you doing? Are you blind? - Easy! I'm driving away. - So drive! Faster! Go on. Go on. - How many guys have you got? - Four, why? - The driver run away. - We don't do chases. I need two. He can't be far. Get the sorbent first, Tomek. Wait! How is she? A helicopter's coming for her. - What's the status? - We need you to hold the drip. You're alive? Hey! Listen, we need to get inside. Inside the Audi? Aren't we waiting for the old man? - Get back. - Am I in the way? - I won't ask again, sir. - Sir? I'm Johnny. - Calm down, Missy. - Hey, man! - Get back. - Give me your number. - Hey, doll face... - What's with her? - Guys, can one of you get here? - Film this. - Jump up! - Are you filming her? Is there a problem? Sławek! Is this funny? Is this funny? - Let me go, pig! - Is it? Enough, let him go. Are you okay, Sławek? Come in, 37. Over. We run the plates. It's a government car. Don't do anything. The Chief's on his way. I'll just go back there. I'll just go back there and... And what? Adam, are you listening? I am, I'm listening. Get back there and wait. Please. You wanna get rid of me. Adam, stop panicking. Do it, for me. I'm not panicking. What should I say? If you throw me under the bus, I'll take you down with me. No way. Get your ass over here. Come on, kid! I told you not to touch it. Turn it off. I said, turn it off! He's seen too many movies. Open the trunk. Don't leave any prints in there. Jennifer. What's that? Here. Just remember to say your prayers. JENNIFER FUN TIMES! Clever. You should be a graphic designer, not a cop. Damn, it's hot today! Here it comes. Clean up this mess. Hi, Chief! What do we have here? A mess. Dead bodies, no driver. Did you secure the parameter? Don't just stand here like a hooker on a curb. Wait! Where's Makowski? Come in, Sławek. - Sławek, copy. - Muniek! I'll go. - Hi. - Morning. Nice day... - It could've been. - Yeah. Get those people out of here, they'll trample all over us. I'm on it. - Morning. - What is that? That's... That's an Audi. We decided to investigate and... - Go in. - Go in? Why? - Who ordered that? - I mean... There was a hit-and-run, so... Get back. - What's your problem? A dry spell? - Get back. The old man wants to talk to you. What are you doing? - What the fuck are you doing? - We gotta find him. I know. But not like that, dammit. - He didn't even fucking slow down! - Enough of that Texas Ranger attitude. They were my family. My cousin's kids. Sławek... We're gonna get him my way. Go, help the new girl. Did you hear me? I don't care it's Sunday morning. I need a psychologist here. Do you understand? What? I don't fucking care it's 60 km.

Sir, do you know who run those poor kids over? Sir, please stop taking pictures. Step back, everyone. But... Jola! There's been a horrible accident. Please step back. It's the Matyses. - It's the Matyses. - Dear Lord! Jesus Christ! Look, that's Michał. Lord have mercy... Michał... Don't go over there. Michał... The Matyses... Yours... The Matyses... Michał... - Don't go there! - Sir, please step back. ...29, 30. Fibrillation. Clear. Please step back, sir. - Let him through! - Step away from the tape! - Step back. - Let him through!

The one who had girl trouble last year. - The government guy. - The celebrity. Yeah, that's him. They won't do shit to him. Put him in a madhouse at best. - What happened? - Nothing, don't go over there, Józek. What happened? - They blocked the road. - There was an accident. - Little kids died. - What do you mean, died? We don't know anything yet. Have you seen Michał? - He run over there. - He did? Gienek. Tell me what to do, will you? Keep him there for now. Maybe I'll get him a doughnut too? I can't do anything before I hear from the top. People will take to the streets. I'll get the chop for that. Just before the fucking retirement! I can't do shit. You know the procedures. See you at the grill? - Muniek? - Sure. What do you want? From the Audi. - Did it record the accident? - Yes. There's more. Look at this, Chief. Do you know anything? Here's the Chief, maybe he'll know. - What's the problem? - What's going on there? - We are investigating. - Were kids involved? - I can't say anything. - I'm just asking about kids. - I still can't say anything. - I heard it's my grandchildren. - It must be tough, I know. - Who is it?

They'll just let him go. - Let's go. - There he is. - Where is he? - He's there, I swear. Confess and we'll close the case. Everyone will see you fucking a hooker on the hood. What do you want? - You won't be able to you play it. - Right, I won't. I can't. As you wish. - I'll tell the papers. - You have a family, right? I'm sure you do. Be careful. You don't get it, do you? There's no way out of it. You'll go down too. - We'll see. - Hey! Wait! For fuck's sake! Wait! Get up! - Fucking punk! - Good! Die, cocksucker! - Get out of there! - Murderer! Stop hiding! Get me a paramedic, now! I'm gonna fucking kill you!

To the car, now! Move it! I'm representing my client on behalf of the government. - Let go! - Back off! You will go down for it. I'll report it! Jesus Christ. Some trouble you made, Adam. A shitstorm two months before the election. From now on, you shut up and let me take care of it. Sign it. Those brats run out in front of you. You couldn't stop, we'll swap the brakes. You were overcome with emotions, so you had a memory lapse and fled the accident site. We can get you out of it. Sign here. Go! Step away, everyone! Go back! Step back! Disperse! Step back, sir! Officer! A man is dying. Get him out of there! Murderer! Copy! Why is there no police on the site? - Stop filming. - Why do you want us to stop? Get him! We need to get him out of here. Hello?

Do you see it? - Kill him! - Do it for what he did! - We'll get justice. - Shoot! Shoot him! Do it! A death for a death! Can we go lower? Let's try landing again. A hard day's work. Right, honey? Yes, I know. Just a minute. Shit. - Look. - What? - A helicopter. - Who cares. Let's turn back. - We're going. - Look, see the ambulance? - Let's go back. - Yeah. We're going back. Wonder what happened here. We're back to talk to our guest about a unique phenomenon which the media has been talking about recently. Our listeners would like to know what this explosion means for us. Is the end of the world coming? You don't have to worry, at least for a few million years. That's reassuring.
