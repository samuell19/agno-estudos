Subtitles by explosiveskull Whoa! Hm! Yeah! Oh! Namaste. A long time ago in a valley in Nepal, there lived a poor peasant whose only possession was a big, strong yak. He was proud of his yak! One morning, the yak ran away into the mountains. When they heard the news, the peasant's neighbours came running. "Such bad luck," they told him. But the peasant smiled and said, "Good luck or bad luck, who can say?" The neighbours couldn't understand what the old man meant, but several days later, the yak returns from the mountain, accompanied by a few other wild yaks. When he arrived, the neighbours came to congratulate the peasant on his good fortune, but once again, - he says, - "Good luck or bad luck, - who can say?" - The next day, as the son was tending to the yaks, he fell and broke his leg. All of the villagers see this as bad luck, but not the peasant. He happily says, one more time, "Good luck or bad luck, who can say?" A few days later, a warlord arrives in the village with his army, and all of the young men are drafted to go fight the war. But when the peasant's son shows up with his broken leg, the soldiers let him go free. And so, was it good luck or bad luck? - To the university. - Step on it. - What's this? Get out! What's going on?! Investigation gone wrong. Happens to everyone. Stop the car! Oof! I am Édouard Martineau II! I insist that you... Oh! Nelly Maloye, private detective. "Intuition in service of the truth." - It's a full service agency. Ah! - Oh! Ah! Oh! Oh, be assured, my dear Mrs. Martineau, we're most grateful for the generous donation your family plans to give to our university. Yes, well, thank my son Édouard. He enjoys boosting his popularity by spending his late father's fortune. Huh! Where is he, anyway? He should be here already. While you wait, perhaps you'd like an exclusive look at the hall that now bears your son's moniker. - Typically ostentatious. - Mhm, hm. Hm? Mr. Picard? Why are you here? What's that curious-looking thing? A hypothesis, ma'am. Relying on solid research, I determined the form, proportion, organ size, musculature and follicle density of... - The yeti. - Precisely! The yeti. - Why have you brought it in here? - The faculty boasts that it displays all stages of evolution. Therefore, we need a yeti. I thought this was a science museum! Yes! Yes, don't worry. We practice the scientific method: we establish a hypothesis, we discuss it and then we throw it out. Your yeti theory is bunk, Mr. Picard. Ha! Correction: its existence hasn't been proven. Just a matter of time. Crazy ramblings of a twisted soul. Scientific, - but twisted. - In their day, Galileo, Newton and Einstein were also thought to be bonkers. But now, they're hailed as pillars of modern scientific thought. Are you comparing yourself to Newton? I also mentioned Einstein and Galileo. Well, now you've gone too far, Picard! Challenging the boundaries of knowledge is the scientists' mission. Get out! That's an order! Here's your fare, sir. You can keep the change. The chief of police is a good friend of the Martineau family! Better find a new career, young lady. No, wait! Please, don't do this! You'll be ruining the career of a first-class detective, you know. Let me make it up to you! Keep that girl - out of the building! - Yes, sir, Mr. Martineau! - No! - Don't you dare touch me! Ow! Ow! Ee! Ee! Ow! If you give me one hour, I'll convince you that the yeti is - the missing link in the chain! - You must have a few enemies I could investigate! I'll conduct a full inquiry! All charges on the house! Mr. Martineau! Are you alright? - Édouard, what happened? - Ah... - Get her out of my sight! Now, hang on! Hm? Oh, there you are! - What a nice surprise! - Do you know this young woman? - Uh... - Yes, very well! We go way back! Poor character reference. Who is she? - His sister. - My neighbour. - Sorry? - His neighbour. - My sister... and neighbour. - Sister and neighbour. - Ah, show this - miss whoever-she-is out, please. - Yes, sir, Professor! OH! Oh, wait 'til I get you! - Get back here, you! Hey! - Watch out for the mammoth! - Oof! - I'll be right back. Argh! Get her! On the left! On the left! OH! My dear Édouard, do you really think I'm going to finance - this circus? - Mother, dear! This room bears my name. This is my chance to make my mark - on the world. - Find some other way to do it. Your father gave you his name, and I refuse to use his money to sully it! - No, no, no, no! - I got her! I got her! - Stop this! - WATCH OUT FOR THE MAMMOTH! Now, look what you've done! Mrs. Martineau, where are you going? Now that you've shown me the clowns, I'll show you my disappearing magic trick. What about your gift? For the museum? That's what I mean. It's gone to Nepal, along with your nonexistent yeti. Oh! This time, Simon Picard, you've gone too far. You're fired! Get out! Huh? On what grounds am I being fired? You don't have what it takes to be part of the anthropology department. Passion only goes so far. - You need much more than that. - I've done my research! There are creatures that resemble the yeti in many countries! In the United States, there's bigfoot. In Canada, there's sasquatch. In China, there's yeren. In Australia, there's yowie, and in Russia, there's chuchunya. How do you explain that? Science is built on proof, Mr. Picard, not on hearsay. But there is proof that the yeti exists! Then go and find it! What? In the Himalayas? Where there's ice and cold and hunger? It's just... I... You have three months. Bring back proof the yeti exists, and I'll reverse my decision and give you back the teaching position I promised you. If you don't you're fired. Go on. Bring back a strand of hair as proof. Something! Mr. Picard. If you would like to find proof of your yeti's existence, I'll finance your expedition. I'm afraid I'm the wrong man. Many adventurers have tried to find it, and all have failed. Almost all of them. What do you mean? You mean someone has already discovered the yeti? Well, there's actually something in Taylor's office that might answer that precise question. Look at this. - What is it? - The diary of Fred Norton, a member of Madison's expedition. I'm certain it holds the secret which leads to the yeti. Taylor keeps it in a safe with other artifacts. Then why doesn't Taylor think it exists? - What do you mean? - You said Taylor has proof - it exists. - He has proof, but he doesn't know it. - What do you mean? - Taylor thinks it's just a relic from an expedition. Convince him to lend it to you, and... I'll think about your offer. He's friendlier with my mother. And after today's disaster, she'll be of no help at all. Well, in that case... - Ahem. - Huh? Come in. Leave it there. The money's on the table. Excuse me? Keep the change, and... close the door, please. - It's your sister. - I don't have a... Who are you, anyway? How did you find me? Nelly Maloye, private detective. "Intuition in service of the truth." I think I can help you. Do you happen to have an autographed photograph of a yeti? Ah, that must be my food. - You hungry? - Mhm! He gave me three months to prove the yeti exists, but I'm not an adventurer! The Himalayas are the highest mountains in the world, with bitterly cold weather, altitude sickness, crevices! People come back changed from the Himalayas, - or they don't come back at all. - What are you gonna do? Well, my dream was to teach anthropology, but now... You really think he exists? The yeti? Of course! Listen to this. - Wha... - A colleague recorded this in the Himalayas. It cost me a fortune! How do you know that's not a camel? It's not. The camel has a sharper pitch. Listen again. Pfft! That's a dog bark played backwards. Cry of the yeti! OK. Whatever. But this is the real deal! Eric Shipton, the famous climber, took it in 1951 on the Menlung Glacier. The shape, the size, the depth: no other animal leaves footprints like this! That's one heck of a beast. Well, this beast, as you say, might be our common ancestor, our grandfather, our patriarch! The missing link in the chain! If I could prove that it has survived to this day, I'll share my discovery with all mankind! So, you have to go! That's one heck of a beast! - You're beautiful! - May I present, Jazzmin, he's a myna. - Jazzmin, Nelly. - That's one heck - of a beast! - Hey! Oh! You're beautiful! - And what is that? - Oh, this is a diary. Oh! That's what Martineau wants me to find! - Martineau hired you? - Then as soon as we get - the journal, we're off to Nepal! - Huh? We're travelling to Nepal? Martineau's paying for the trip. If we find the yeti, it'll be a big career boost for me. HELP! HELP! SOMEBODY STOLE MY PURSE! HELP! - What happened, lady? - A thief stole my purse! - Where? - He went that way! - Which way? That way, I said! Left at the corner! - Huh? Looks like he got away. - You'll be able to catch him, he was limping. Limping, huh? OK! - I'll call the police. - No! You go after him! - I said he went that way! - You again! - Oh! - Hmm! Oh, when I... Huh? Shh! It's me. - Whoa! - Nelly, this way! This is it! He's coming! Huh? Let me see. What make is this lock? General! Perfect! There's the safe! Fred Norton's journal is inside. Do you trust this guy Martineau? No, but he did reserve passage for us on a boat... which sets sail at four o'clock in the morning. Better hurry! Oh, this is not good. - Not good at all! - What? Is there a problem? There's a major problem! This is a Patterson safe! Patterson starts with a P. I only know up to the letter M. The lock on the door is a general lock which starts with a G, so that was no problem. Now, if this was a Montana or a Marconi, I could crack it in a flash, but a Patterson? I haven't gotten to the letter P! You're learning to crack safes in alphabetical order? Of course! I'm methodical. Then let's be methodical. Here it is! - Ha ha! - Come on! Hm? Hm? Hm... What we just did is strictly illegal! We'll rot in prison for the rest of our lives! Relax, nobody saw us! I'm a professional! Put on your knapsack. Our ship sails in less than an hour. - What is that? - It's a pocket knife! My neighbour gave it to me. You see? It has a knife, some scissors, a screwdriver, a loop, some pliers, a can opener, and... a thingy. - Wow. - I traded this little marvel for Jazzmin. A pocketknife is much more practical - than a myna in the Himalayas. - You're leaving Jazzmin with your neighbour? Hi, little fella. - Oh, oh, oh! - Come here! - You're beautiful! - Come with me! - Yahoo! Ha ha! - Jazzmin! Woo! Boing! Woo! Ha ha! Woo! Woo! Ha ha! I got him! I lost him. Birdy, birdy, birdy! Come with me! He hoo! Birdy, birdy, birdy! Use your hand! - Hey! Hey! Wait! - Hey! Wait for us! - Wait! Hey! We're here! - Wait! Nelly! Whoa! Ah! Oh! What an entrance! Welcome aboard the S. S. Indiana. Your friend, Mrs. Martineau's son, hopes you have a great trip. Could you take me to him, please? Oh, sorry. Mr. Martineau isn't on board. He's sailing - on a different ship. - Where? - There. We're off to Nepal! Jazzmin! This way. What language is this? No idea. I hope the Nepalese can tell me. What's so special about this journal? Norton was part of the doomed Madison expedition that mysteriously disappeared near the Menlung Glacier over 30 years ago. There were no survivors. At least, that's what we thought, until Norton mysteriously reappeared in a village one day, exhausted and half-crazed. The university bought his journal... ...shortly before his death. I'm quite convinced that the Madison expedition discovered the yeti on the Menlung Glacier, and that's how they met their fate. Once the journal is deciphered, I'll know where to find the yeti. Mr. Martineau insisted that you have our finest cabin. Hm... uh. Uh... And over the Big Dipper, you can see the Little Dipper. And, to the far right, is the North Star. She has been a sailor's guide for centuries, and, uh... the North Star is in the wrong location. - Uh, Captain? - Captain? Can you explain why we're sailing south when India's to the east? We are taking a short detour to pick up some cargo in Australia. Have you ever seen a kangaroo? You've gotta be kidding! I've only got three months - to find the yeti... - Hey! We paid to go to India! Two trips for the price of one! What a deal! Enjoy the sun! Relax in the comfort of your cabin! It'll be as though you're on a leisurely cruise! Ha ha! Huh. Hm... hm? One, two! - One, two! - Bring back my lifeboat, you bunch of pirates! Bring back my lifeboat! One, two! One, two! One... what? One, two! One, two! One... Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh! Whoa! Boing. We're in Durbar Square, alright! Pretty nice place! Hm. Huh? The things people will do to entertain the tourists. So, where does - the Gombu family live? - West of Durbar Square. I'm sure they'll be able to decode the diary. The Gombu family have been mountain guides for generations. A member of their family actually disappeared on the Madison Expedition. I'm lost. Alright, this is it! Boy, you gotta be really lost to say you're lost when you're not lost. Huh? Uh... Namaste? Ahem. Namaste! My name is Simon Picard, and... I'm Nelly Maloye, private detective. "Intuition in service of the truth." We come as friends. Oh, and namaste to you. We're looking for a family named Gombu. Well, I think we've exhausted the topic. Uh... we hope you have a very lovely evening. - Dhanyabad! - Isn't it namaste? - No, you say dhanyabad. - I thought it was namaste. - In this case, it's dhanyabad. - It's namaste. - Dhanyabad. - OH! Namaste! May I help you? A member of your family was a guide on the Madison Expedition. This is Fred Norton's journal. He wrote it while on the expedition while in the company of your relative. - Dhanyabad. - Dhanyabad. There are many symbols and diagrams. I was hoping you'd decode it? If you turn to the third page, there's a strange character. The symbol is quite fascinating! Norton was no doubt trying to tell us something. Namaste! May I have a look? - Tensing! - Oh, sure. It belongs to one of Madison's colleagues. It's about Madison? And my grandfather? Yes! At least, I think it is. - What do you wanna do with it? - I hope to find the yeti. Pfft! And we need a good guide. This is just a bunch of scribbles, sahib. But they've gotta mean something, don't they? Good luck. Namaste. Sahib! Sahib! Are you really going off - to search for the yeti? - Yes, we are. Then it is my duty to carry on the work of my grandfather. I'm coming with you. Welcome to our adventure, Tensing. Namaste! This is the famous Cavendish Hotel - you were looking for. - Marvelous! Do you think he's checked in yet? There you are, my dear friends! Édouard, I'd like you to meet Tensing Gombu. Oh, yes, yes. I'm afraid there's bad news. The Kadamba region has been hit with a bad storm. The roads are closed. We'll have to wait several weeks - before they open again. - Planes fly in bad weather. Excellent idea! We'll parachute you in with your equipment, right on top of the Semtong Glacier. - Menlung. - Whatever you say. P... p... parachute? I... I'd prefer - a more traditional landing. - Yes, but the problem is that the region's only pilot is in prison for smuggling. As you know, Einstein once said, "If someone told me that the world would come to an end "in one hour, I'd spend 55 minutes analyzing the situation and 5 minutes to find the solution." We know the problem. We don't have a pilot. Ahem. We've got a pantry full of supplies! There's takaris, a dal bhat, and churiyan. Whoa! Son, accomplish your mission as did your father, your grandfather and your great grandfather. I'm counting on you. All you have to do is land on a plateau near the Menlung Glacier. Wow, it's beautiful! Nelly, look out! Whoa! - Oh! - Nelly! You have - a pilot's licence, right? - Close enough. I took the theory courses, but I ran out of money for the actual flying lessons. Anyway, a diploma doesn't make the pilot. So, let's get down to business. What do you think this symbol means? Scribbles, sahib. Excuse me, sahib, but we have to decide where to land soon. We should steer to the right, shouldn't we? It's very clear we need to go left. I say we come back when conditions improve, - With a real pilot! - Don't worry, these are just clouds! - The wing flaps aren't working! - We're going to crash! - Put this on! - Quick! We've gotta jump! NO! I am in control of this thing! Ah! Come on, you! Whoa! Whoa! Ow! Oh! I'd prefer a more traditional landing! SIMON! TENSING! Oh! Hm? Hm? The yeti! Guh! - Simon! - Nelly! - Have you seen Tensing? - No! - Yahoo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! - Jazzmin! - Whoa! Bing. Bonk. Ooh. Sahibs! Tensing! - Ouch! - Are you injured? It's my leg. It'll be as though you're on a leisurely cruise. Poor Tensing, you unlucky fellow! Oh, you know. Good luck or bad luck, it all depends on how you see it. Injuring your leg at 11 000 feet? - No way I'd call that good luck! - Actually, I agree with Tensing. We're lucky to be alive after a crash like that. If we'd been lucky, we wouldn't have crashed! Not crashing wouldn't be lucky, it wouldn't be anything - at all! - I'll take nothing at all over your good luck any day. Do you really think like that, or are you - just being unpleasant? - Que garne? - Que garne? - What? What's que garne? - What can we go? - Nothing, unfortunately. Anyway, we'd better salvage our equipment before it disappears under the snow. - Brrr! - This weather is bad even for a yeti, isn't it? Ah. Have you found our provisions? Yes! We have food to eat! Well! Enough of freezing outside. Let's go freeze inside the cockpit. Come on, let's go. All we could find was bread and hot peppers. You saved the peppers! That's excellent! Reshampattis, byadagis and mirchis! Mmm! Try it, sahib. In this cold, - you need your strength. - Mhm... Ahh! You are what you eat, sahibs. If you eat something strong, then you will become strong. This is Golf Tango Echo Mike. Golf Tango Echo Mike. Our plane has crashed. We've had mechanical failure. One person injured. Position is latitude 27, 42 minutes, 4 seconds north, longitude 86 degrees, 25 minutes, 11 seconds east. Our morale is good. I repeat: our morale is good. With the mountains that are all around, our signal might not get through to anybody! Nelly, the storm has blown us way off course... - Are you sure about that? - It would be wise to give up - on our mission. - Oh, no, no, no, no, no! It wouldn't. We didn't come this far to give up so easily. - There's no way! - Ow! - Sorry, Tensing! - There. That's better. As Kipling once said, "If you can keep your head when all about you are losing theirs, and..." Excuse me, I'll be right back. OK. There's no food, we're way off course, and Tensing's hurt. We cannot carry on like this. We must alert the rescue team. You're right. From now on, we are in survival mode. Don't waste time. If we want our messages to reach the rescue squad, we'll need to get to higher ground. There, to the south. It's a two-day hike. Two days?! - What the heck are you doing?! - Tensing! Which way is our landing site? - To the right! - Nelly! The plane has no wings! Who needs wings when you've got skis? Yeah ha! Yeah ha! Yeah ha! What was that? The departure song! It's a family tradition. Whoa... Did you learn these manoeuvers in your theory class? You'll have to turn right, Miss Nelly! This thing won't turn! - Nelly, cut the power! - I tried! It won't respond! We've gotta open up the panel! - I need a screwdriver! NOW! - A screwdriver? - Hurry! No. No. No. No! Got it! Well, here we are! At least we made it up to an elevation of 12 000 feet! Mayday! Mayday! Mayday! This is Golf Tango Echo Mike! Golf Tango Echo Mike! Immediate assistance required! Over! OK, where are we now? What is that? Shi Mung, the great Cantonese singer! Ah, I love it! I don't wanna listen to your Shi Mung. I want someone to answer our distress call! It's unlikely your calls are getting through with all this static! This song's not bad. So, show me where we are. At the foot of Menlung Glacier, I think. - Huh?! - Did I hear right? So that is the Menlung Glacier, where we'll find the yeti? Oh, well, uh... why don't we just see if there's one hanging around? Yeah ha! Yeah ha! Yeah ha! Oh, and bring the radio. I don't know what's worse: the biting cold or the screeching Shi Mung? Tensing, you're making me work up a sweat! Well, you don't hire a Sherpa by the pound. There have been many deaths on this glacier. That, I don't want to hear. Look at that! That's Mount Everest! Our people call it Chomolungma. Cho... mo... lu... ma. It means "earth mother." I really feel like an intruder in this place. Yes. We all are, Miss Nelly. That's good. Perfect. Smile! Try to look natural. Tensing, look at the camera. Nelly... oh, that's nice. That's nice. OK, try a different pose. Relax! Look happy. Not too happy! That's perfect. Oh. I'm coming! Ah! Hm. Tensing can sleep in the small tent. We'll put our supplies in that tent and we'll share the big one. Do you sleep left or right? Uh... right? - Tensing... - Oh, sorry, sorry. OK, if this symbol indicates the east, that means that this one means north. Right! And then this number here must mean distance... hm. Norton was British, so he measured in feet. Right. And this drawing here is a mountain peak: a sharp, high peak. And that's a... crevice. Or a V? A V for victory? Or is it a crevice for victory? Yeah, not bad, that. Yeah ha! Yeah ha! Yeah ha! What was that? Yeah ha! Yeah ha! Yeah ha! That's his morning song, I suppose. According to my theory, if we walk 5 000 feet to the northeast, we'll come to a high mountain peak. Then, we'll see some jagged rocks on the north face. If we stay on that path, we'll end up in the yeti's lair. 4 998, 4 999, 5 000! Hm? Right. It must be a secret lair. But we did climb exactly 5 000 feet. I don't understand. Did you notice a high, sharp mountain peak? Oh, my mistake! It's not measured in feet, but in yards! And the V doesn't mean a crevice. On the contrary, it's... if you look at it, the V is at 45 degrees, so it's a steep cliff. And what I thought was north was west, and east was south. Well! Onwards and upwards! No trail. No yeti. No nothing. Not a single trace or clue on the horizon. - Take that! - Hm? Stupid mountain. Hey! At least it's good for something. OK, I think it's time for me to take a look at this thing. Oh, no! Yeow! Ha ha! Yeow! Vroom! Woop! Yeow! Go ahead, have a look at it, too. I'll wait here. Alright Simon, keep your chin up. We'll just rest a while, then we'll keep looking 'til we find your yeti! That's assuming they exist. Is anybody hungry? Oh! What if we tried luring it with a hot pepper sandwich? What do you think? Huh? It wouldn't work. According to Shipton, the yeti is a carnivore. - Huh? - So, we don't know if the yeti exists, but we know he's a carnivore. All the more for us! Reshampattis, byadagis, mirchis! I never wanna see a hot pepper again. - Hey! Oh! - Our peppers! Miss Nelly? Whoa! Get ready for the sleigh ride of your life! - Ah! - Whoa! Good work, cowboy! Yeah, what a rodeo! Did you hear that? What is that? Sh! It's really close. It seems to have stopped. Then, uh, what's that? - Simon! - What? - Look at this! There's food here! Canned goods, chocolate, coffee! No more hot pepper sandwiches! Hm? George Madison! It worked! We followed the right path! Tensing? You're walking. When did your foot get better? You were carrying me. It's hard to say. Right, because you couldn't put weight on it. - Yes, I know, but I can now. - You're certain - it's safe to walk on it? - Well, it's much safer than being carried by the two of you. He deserves a proper burial. Sahib, come see this. His grandfather. We know they didn't die of starvation. What if the yeti attacked them? The mountain has a way of settling her debts. Hey! What are you doing? If you need these, all you have to do is ask. Perfect! This was once held by Madison. - At least this one is readable. - Listen. "June 10th, 1924. "For 10 days now, my companions and I have been surrounded "by a landscape that is endlessly transformed by wind and snow storms." "Weariness and despondency have descended upon my men. "Are they... possessed "by the spirits whose voices "echo through the mountains? "I don't know. "Madness has taken each of them, "and is now waiting at my door. "Nothing will save me. Norton himself disappeared last night "after losing his mind, "leaving me here... alone. "I am already dead, "forever wandering in the icy shadows of eternity, "ready to haunt those who are... foolish enough to follow in our footsteps." That was the last thing he wrote. Do you think Madison and his men were overcome by some evil power? My father told stories about mountain spirits. The mountain spirits? No, don't! Stop shooting, Miss Nelly! It's dangerous! The spirits are everywhere! Do something, sahib! We're doomed! Like Madison! Oh, look out! Hm? TENSING? Tensing? Miss Nelly? Are you OK? I think so. And you? I'm fine. And you, sahib? - Are you OK? - I could be worse. I don't know what came over me. Tensing, throw me some light. It's of no use, sahib. There are tons of them. I think we should be outside, searching for the yeti, eating hot peppers and getting frozen feet! And instead, we're prisoners inside a mountain... AH! For sure this is a bit of bad luck. But as you know, good luck or bad luck... Not this time, Tensing. It's over. Hm? Oops. - Batteries are dead, sahib. - Great! That's all we need. I can't take any more! Just leave me alone. And where would you like us to go? Come on, Miss Nelly. Let's go explore the cave. Ow! Ow! OW! Ow! OK, we have three matches left. I can't mess up. Sorry about my behaviour. I... shouldn't've lost it like that. - Diary. - Norton's diary? What for? - Diary! - OK! Sure. Here. What are you doing?! We only have two matches. And keep your voice down! So, now where do we go? My intuition says to... go right. That's great! Then we'll go left. - Left? - I saw what you did in the plane. If you say right, it means we should go left. That's precisely the reason I said "right." I meant left. Fine. But, if you were thinking left, yet said, "Go right," which led us to go left, then logic says we should go right. Come on. We're going left. Hm! Do you hear that? - Ouch! - Shh! Here! Ugh! Give me that. Hm! Well, look at that! Look! Hm! Hm? Hm? Nelly, come on! Huh? Hm... Wait. Wait, is it? Could it be? It is! This is it! We found it! Look at this! NELLY! We found the yeti! We now have proof it exists! NELLY? Come see this, sahib. It's her cap. The yeti took her? I thought yeti were afraid of humans! You'll have to revise your theory, sahib! Hm. OK. Which way should we go? Hard to say. I know! Let's do what Nelly would do! Yes! We have to think like she does... ...and do the exact opposite! Hm... She'd track her prey. - Good thinking, sahib. - So, what is the opposite - of tracking one's prey? - Attracting it. Then we'll attract our prey! Now... How do we attract the yeti? Got it! One of us hides while the other serves as bait. And... who will serve as bait? The one with the most meat on him. Oh, no. The bait has to be the one who runs the fastest. I'm the oldest in the group. I run the operation. - You're the bait. - I have a better idea. Hm? This is fabulous! He's enormous! Not at all what I thought he'd be! Move over, Tensing! You're in my frame! Whoa! Tensing! There's an entire tribe of them! A village... full of yeti! There's Nelly! Ooh! Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay! Uh... Nelly Maloye, private detective. "Intuition in service of the truth." She never quits. Look! We have to get her out of there. Wait 'til nightfall. The yeti will be asleep. What do you think, Tensing? Will they turn in soon? Look up there! The snow! Ah ha! Ha ha! Ha! AH! Making snow fall on the fire was an excellent idea, sahib. Dear Nelly... Run for safety while there's still time. For me... the road ends here. We all have to leave before the yeti find us! Too late for me. You go. I'll do what I can to distract them. Spread the good news to the whole world... and tell the university I'd be honoured if they named a scholarship after me. They're coming! I saw my life flash before me in slow motion! Huh? Hello, little guy! No, don't move! No, no, no, no, no! It isn't what you think! Hold on! Tensing! Hm? Hm? Hm? Uh, you see, he climbed up the tree and, uh... Yeah, yeah, yeah. Enough. Ignore them. I can't help it. Seeing yetis laugh makes me want to laugh too! Hey! That's it! That's the proof! - What? - The missing link! - Huh? - They say laughter is unique - to humans, right? - Uh, yes... - But these yeti are laughing! - Are they ever! So, that proves their connection to the human species! Would you call that scientific evidence? Well, as much as Newton's apple was. We have made contact with the yeti! That's promising! I'll be able to study them in-depth! Uh, what? They want us to leave their land and leave them alone. It looks like they're pretty serious about that. Come on, Simon. Let's go. They're giving us a chance to leave in peace. But... Fine. My friends, the contents of this box will change the world! In a few days, we'll be back in Kathmandu. Our discovery will be recognized by the most prestigious universities! Tensing, you'll be the most famous guide on the planet! You're grandfather would be so proud of you! And you, Nelly! Your phone will ring off the hook! Scotland Yard, Interpol: you'll get to pick what you want! We're leaving now, but we'll be back. Right, Tensing? With better equipment and better prepared. Huh? It's incredible that despite all the bad luck we had, we still managed to find the yeti. In fact, it was your so-called "bad luck" that made it possible for you to find your yeti, sahib. Simon, in your opinion, what do you think will happen once - you announce your discovery? - The news will spread like - wildfire! - And everybody will wanna get a glimpse of the yeti.

If there's abuse, we'll intervene! You know that! How? We won't be able - to stop it! - Why not? We discovered the yeti! Many people dreamed of doing just that, but we did it! You think it's alright for the yeti, who have survived this long, to end up as circus animals? We should just let them live in peace. We're looking for signs of the... - Listen! - Rescue Alpha. Do you read? We're trying to locate your... Mayday, mayday, mayday! Rescue Flight Alpha, do you read me? There! Up there, we'll have a better chance! Mayday, mayday, mayday! Rescue Flight Alpha! Can you hear me? - Hey, whoa! - Sorry! Our position is latitude 27 degrees, 57 minutes and 10 seconds north. Longitude 86 degrees, 27 minutes, 13 seconds east. Contact... Survivors... Rescue mission... Message received... What's he saying? What's he saying? This is Édouard Martineau Junior! We have located you! - Have you found the yeti? - A complete tribe! - It was wonderful! - Did you get them on film? - One full reel of film! - Ahem! The images are won... derf... Can't hear you. You're breaking up. Too much static. Battery is weak. I'm cutting communications. Hello, my friends! Oh! Wait 'til Mama hears this! I met with a representative from Pan American Films. They want to produce a big-budget movie about our most extraordinary adventure! Is that me?! Well, that's a strange reaction. Oh, of course! You think the press will be all over me! Don't worry. When I'm asked if I did it alone, I'll tell them... A great man's best asset is the people he has around him. Your name will be in all of the history books, right next to mine. Just like... oh, what's-his-name and Christopher Columbus. Oh! I've just reserved the Cavendish Hotel for the press conference. Noon tomorrow, the whole world will know! Listen, uh... I think we need to think about this a while. It's all thought out, my friend. You've done your job; I'll do the rest. I financed your mission, don't forget. What are you doing?! Simon, it's now or never! Give me that! No! Don't do this! NO! NELLY! NELLY! Please, help me! I've got you. Miss Nelly! Are you there? No one could survive - such a fall from up here. - Huh? Well, alright. Let's go. Quite obviously, there's nothing we can do here. Go without us. Descend slowly along the side of the cliff, sahib. That's right. Short bounds. Whoa! NELLY! Rescue Alpha! Ah! Ah! Ah! Jazzmin... HELLO? DOWN HERE! - Nelly? - Simon? - Are you injured? - I don't think so! - Where are you? - Tensing! Nelly is alive! Lower me a little further. Impossible, sahib. There is no more rope. Nelly, can you climb your way out? There's ice everywhere! I'll never make it! - Stand back! I'll cut the rope! - No! - You won't be able to get out! - We'll see. Tensing! - I'm going down to Nelly. - No, sahib! Simon, did you recover the film? - No. Édouard flew off with it. - We have to stop him! We have to save the yetis! First, let's save you, then we'll save the yeti. Now... You?! I... have... to... get... out... of... here. You... and... your... family... are... at... risk. In... great... danger! Do you understand? No. Hm? Hm... Nelly? Where's Nelly? I... have... to... find... Nelly. You... have... to... help... me. Hm. Hm? Whoa! Whoa... Have... you... seen... my... friends? Where's Tensing? He's still up top. He'll be better off without us. I hope my instructions are clear, my good man. The contents in that canister are of the highest importance. As clear as a bell, sir. Once the film's been developed, I'll deliver it to the Cavendish Hotel. - Before noon! - Thank you! - Dhanyabad! - Namaste! - No, it's dhanyabad. - Uh, no. Namaste. - No, it's dhanyabad. - No, it's namaste. - In this case, it's dhanyabad. - No. Nelly, follow me! Come on, get on! Uh, Simon? We're in a hurry. Hm. Interesting film, sir. Thanks. Will you run the projector? - Mhm. - Perfect! Get to it. I'd like to see the film before the journalists do. Come on, come on! - Oh, dear. - NO! No! No, no, no, no, no, no! What, chief? Are you the explorer? Yes! I discovered the yetis. Cavendish Hotel? Ah, dhanyabad! Namaste! Mm. Hm! Mhm! Sorry about our appearance. Thank you for coming out in such large numbers! Before I show you my exceptional footage, I would like to dedicate the discovery of the yeti to my loyal assistants, Nelly Maloye and Simon Picard, who gave their lives for science. I know Nelly and Simon would have wanted no better resting place than that of the majestic... Dim Sum Glacier. We've been in the mountains. We were part of the expedition. Édouard Martineau's? Édouard Martineau II! - Never mind! - My life has been guided by my love of animals. When I was eight, my father gave me my first pony. Hm... That's one heck of a beast! My parents were always travelling, and I learned that an animal's love is life's - most precious gift... - Hey, Mr. Pony! You gonna - show us your yeti or not? - Uh, well, I... Yeti! Yeti! Yeti! Yeti! Huh? A mission chief must know how to inspire his team to surpass themselves. Here, you see our adventurers with Sherpa, our famous mountain guide. They slowly make progress, determined to scale the highest mountain range in the world! One of the most perilous adventures - since Tutankhamen! - Turn it off! The matinee is over! - Go home, people! - What's goin' on? - What's going on here? - Hold on tight, Simon! Hey! Cut it out! - Hey! I thought you guys were dead! - I beg your pardon! - Hey, look! It's a yeti! - Huh? This is the dumbest hoax I've seen in my life! - Who do you think you are? - Go back to where - you came from! Get out of here! - Charlatan! - Phony! No, wait! Please stay! Tensing. Looks like the press conference was a smashing success! Tensing! Charlatan! Impostor! Charlatan! Impostor! You know what, Tensing? You're a hero. - And one heck of an actor! - Oh, no. I disagree. He's a terrible actor. Did you see him as a yeti? Please! Tensing... Namaste! - Namaste! - Namaste! Father, this is for you. So is this. Today, our son has heroically finished the mission started by our ancestors. Oh, if your grandfather were still here, he would be so proud of this great accomplishment of yours. For you, sir. Dear Professor, I thought the faculty would be proud to display this in the museum. Thank you for the challenge. Simon Picard. Hm... I've decided that I don't want to be a professor after all. Oh, no? What will you do instead? For a living? I'm not sure. I like my new life! Hm. Is that the island of Madagascar? No. It isn't big enough to be Madagascar. Looks like smoke in the distance! Hang on! There isn't supposed to be an island there. I've never seen one on a map. - You serious? - It's a mystery! - Come on! - Whoa! Oh, oh, oh, oh! Uh! Yeah ha! Yeah ha! Yeah ha! Whoa! Bring back my lifeboat, you bunch of pirates! Bring back my life boat! I miss the yetis. How 'bout you? I don't know! They laugh about the strangest things. Subtitles by explosiveskull
