Is it morning? Or is it night already? Do you love me? Yeah. Hey, my hips are killing me. You poor thing! It's the third time. It's incredible. You're the one who's incredible. - Why is that? - You're a peeping tom. Me? It's forbidden! These two never rest. It makes me horny. Come. Here we go. Say... What is it? Don't play innocent. Hands off. Look at this! You can't fool me. My fingers are drowning. I said no. You are so stingy with me. But if I find the treasure, I'll become rich. I don't believe in that treasure story. Stop! - You must pay first. - You're kidding. I can't stop myself now. Finish it by yourself then. That's too cruel. Wait, Ohisa! She's gone... Ungrateful girl. And you, sleep! They are such a vigorous young couple! They haven't stopped in three days. They'll fuck each other to death. Once I spent a whole day fucking. - And you? - Me? - I'm still a virgin. - That's hard to believe. Liar! Good night, owner. I'm taking a bath. Wait a minute. Why do you seem so lustful? Your body is perfect. I should get dressed again. Did you know that there is a transvestite dressed as a geisha, at the inn next door? - Liar! - Really? But how can he sleep with his clients? I don't know. Good evening, owner. We're having our break. Good evening. Here's the mean girl. That pool is dirty. I feel good. Well, I'm leaving. I'm going to pee over there to avoid the mean girl. Oito, you're doing it again? It's unappropriate. Necessity is everything. Is she going to pee? Don't mind it. I'm going too. I'll follow you. Let's have a contest. I feel so much better. Enough with that. Me too... I'll join the trio. You perv! He was spying on us. Did you think you could get away with it? This is going to cost you! Owner, look! Let's see your face. You? But you could bathe with us if you wanted. That's not as fun. - It's more arousing to spy. - You pathetic man. Come this way. Good-for-nothing! Help me! Treasure Hunting Tools for rent Good hunting. - The shovel costs 5.000 yens. - What? - Taxes included. - That's expensive. But there really is a treasure to be found. It's safer than the lottery. You seem to be lucky. During the Bakumatsu Era the soldier Oguri, came here to take refuge with his 30.000 pieces of gold. They say that this treasure is worth 3 billion yens. It is hidden somewhere in the mountain. It's buried under a 500 year old cypress tree. Do like dogs: have a good nose. I'll find the treasure. Good luck. He overused his hips. We'll share the treasure. - Good hunting. - See you tonight. I'm going that way. We'll swallow everything. Take it, Norio. I'm sorry for your wife. But dying with you makes me very happy. Don't say anything. We will be united at last, for all eternity. It's so romantic. I don't want to die. Are you dead? Shiori! Don't go without me! Wait. Stay with me. Shiori! It's the treasure! The treasure! - Who cares? - It's incredible! Yes, I found a gold nugget. It's the treasure! - It's gold! - Let us see! I found it! I'm rich! - This must be the place. - It's mine. Let me see. Tonight, the drinks are on me. What's this thing? This is fake gold. Fake gold? This is not gold. It's a fake. It has no value. It's value is zero, like you. And I believed I was rich. Damn! Oh, are they dead? Come, everybody. There was an accident. Let me feel his wrist. It's a piece of gold! It's mine! Welcome, sir. Carry my luggage. - Is the owner home? - Yes, she's taking a bath. I'll warn her. Are all the clients treasure hunting? I see. - Give me the bag. - Who is he? You've never seen him? It's Yagisawa. He's very rich. Very, very rich. These aren't mixed baths. I know. We are very similar, though. What I want to say is, we are naked before God's eyes. You have a great body. Being a widow has its benefits. - I'm going to scream. - Relax. Just a little cuddle. Take your hands off me. I understand. Well, let's talk about our little business. I already answered you regarding that matter. I insist. I am offering you 80 millions for this old inn. It's a good price. Really? Don't you think the price could be higher? I see. Your price will be mine. I'll buy your inn along with your body. What is your price? - 500 millions. - Don't joke around. Don't forget the burried treasure. There's not enough proof. We've only found one piece. In that case, you should just give up. Damn, she's really hot. Mr. Yagisawa... What? She slipped between your hands. Just like an eel. Our boss is like a first-rate eel, she tastes delicious. Now you're talking. Mr. Yagisawa, If you feel like it... What? It's risky here. - Let's go to the back. - Hey! Show me. Relax. I think you're ready. Can I? 500 millions. All that for a eel... You're as good as her. Of course. I am first-rate too! Come here, Heisaku. Your wife went to town. Do you have some time? Perv. Is it alright? It's okay. She's the girl that atempted suicide. Come this way. Hurry up. C'mon, undress. Hurry up. Are you interested in her? Not at all. - You're the one that I want. - Can I believe you? Of course. Undress already! You're a young beauty! - I'm so happy! - I love married men. It makes me wet. You're a weird student. You work here to have sex? I do what I want, right? Don't forget to pay me. We earn nothing here. Okay? Is 10.000 okay for you? Okay! - It feels good. - Do you like that? You're in good shape for an old man. So? Do you like it? This is really a bad time. Wake up! Sit up. Here. Drink that. So... I didn't die? Owner... And Norio? Where is he? Is he dead? It can't be. He died without me! I want to join him! Kill me! I want to die! Norio! Why did you save me? Calm down. He's alive. He has some nerve, though. He could have taken care of you. He only thinks about the treasure now. Treasure? The other rooms are occupied. You'll stay here during your convalescence. Also, don't do anything foolish. I'm sorry I worried you so much. Let's finish this. Heisaku! Aren't you done? Get out of there! Understood! - Did you find anything? - Let me go, girls. Gold is my new love! We are more expensive. - You don't want us anymore? - I prefer gold. You are dishonourable. Are you not happy? Thanks to him, you'll be able to pay your room. Exactly. At least, he's generous. Poor boy. We decided to share the money. I don't trust you. We're not going to fight because of a coin. Sooner or later, I'll find the treasure. You're my hero! Take these plates. Don't forget to heat them up. And be carefull not to knock them over. The treasure is here. Are you there? Norio? What do you want? You seem disapointed. Amazing. The gold is worth 3 billion yens. I want your help. If I find the treasure I can pay all my debts. I'll buy an appartment and see the world. But... we came here to die. I can't remember why I wanted to die. Don't worry, I'll make you come till you die tonight. I have to divide with the others... But it's still a great amount of money! Excuse me. Let me pass. You should stay in bed. Here, help us. It'll get your mind off things. Alright. It'll be fine. Be carefull. Well, well. - You must decide. - Why? This room is too small for us three. Honestly, I love you both. You know who I am. You're purchasing every inn in the region. And I let my mistresses manage them. Really? Idiot! I'm negotiating the purchase of this inn. But your boss still refuses to sell it. I'll need a new mistress to manage it. Help yourself. Oh, what a joy! I'm in paradise! This is it! I want Ohisa's breasts. And Oito's sex. What does she have that I don't? He has to be unbiased. Relax, you two. Who has the prettiest one? Let me judge individually. Back off! Hello, fake-suicide girl. Will you sleep with me? We'll fool around. Norio is only interested in the treasure. - Stop, please. - No one's here. Stop. I'm going to test your excitability to sak?. I'm going to faint. I'm coming. So far so good. The love potion had its effect. It soaked your lovely sexes. I came. - That feels good. - You came? A real fountain. You came already? I couldn't help myself. Say, Ohisa. - Can you leave us alone? - Why? I didn't come yet. Just take this money. I'll give you two. Here, have another. You're greedy. What's wrong with you? You're in heat. I'm too horny. - You're one hell of a slut. - Men love sluts, right? - Hurry up. - There's no rush. - Can we do everything? - Oh yes. Don't make me wait. Be a bitch! On all fours. And point your ass up. Finger yourself. Why? I want to see a woman pleasuring herself. Go. I can't hold it. Quick. Hurry up! Please! Make me come, quick. I'm close. Here it comes. Shit. Hey! Where are you going? I'm going to check if I turned the gas off. Liar. She's cute as hell. I love this taste. It's slightly acid. Who is there? Norio dear... Norio, is that you? Yes, it's me. I'm happy. Norio, take me. Norio. Good night. Good night. Naughty Heisaku! What is it? I was looking at your face. It's the same face when we make love. In both cases, I'm digging. You only think about the treasure. 3 billion yens... Show yourselves! I'm disappointed in you. Money means so much to you? 3 billion yens. Show yourselves! That's a very deep hole you made. Yours is even deeper. One could get lost in it. You want to take your chance? I see, I see... You're craving it, aren't you? Such a sweet ass. You're sensitive. - Your lover will hear us. - Exactly. I want to make him jealous. Wait a bit. You're so good at this. It's thanks to the blisters on my fingers. I have got lots of them from digging with the shovel. I love your blisters. Oh really? I see. Are you satisfied with my blisters? You like that? You like that? A coin! - A gold coin! - What about me? - I can't get it off. - Don't do it. I'm trying! - You're out. - I'm taking it off! I did it. The 3 billion yens. They're here! If only I had gold in my hole... I won't go back on my decision. You're being too radical. Asking 500 millions for this inn is just crazy. Not at all. Don't forget the treasure. It's give or take. Wait a minute. What treasure are you talking about? We only found two coins. Maybe they're just coins from the chest that has been found before. Without actual proof of the treasure's existence, your inn is not worth 500 millions. It's up to you. I don't want to sell it, anyway. But... It's ready. You can serve it. And when are you delivering my order? Be patient. I need it. Listen. Alright? The bastard! No panties tonight. I love her acid taste. Pubic hair? And this texture? These labia... And it tastes like vinegar, not acid! I got you at last, bastard! You perv! Look who's talking! Now that you started it, do it until the end. Come here. More! My paiement was rejected? That's impossible. I have two millions in my account. It's not enough? That's bad! I'm going to gather some funds for sure. Are you having money troubles? Leave me alone. I have work to do. It must be tough on you. Don't worry. I want to help you. Trust me. I'm not self-interested. I'm doing it out of friendship. Is that so? I won't backstab you. I'm a gentleman. I'll give you my body. I give up. You won. Don't sacrifice yourself like this. Let me take care of everything. Women... are destined to be sad. Let me talk with the boss. Yagisawa speaking. Give me your account number. Good morning. It's Yagisawa. I'm doing fine, thank you. You are the real treasure. You are mine now. You're so marvelous! You're the perfect woman. I never felt so much pleasure before. And you? Are you satisfied? Yes. - Listen. - Yes? I'll sell you the inn. Really? Yes. It's like you said, maybe the treasure doesn't exist anymore. And... Me... And you... Well, you see... 80 millions is enough then? - I want 100 millions. - 100 millions? It's nothing for you. Well, it's a deal. - When do we sign it? - The sooner, the better. Yes, we never know! Sales contract Here. Perfect! And now, I'm the owner of the inn and the nearby land. It's yours. All this money... is mine! And what will happen to us? Don't worry about it. Keep on working. Owner, you'll be the manager of the inn. Come quick! More gold has been discovered! A chest with 1.000 coins! 1.000 coins? Give me back the contract! - I don't agree with it! - No way! You signed it. It's a great contract indeed. Here's the treasure! Good work, everyone! We have to share it now! Wait a second! Dear sirs, I'm the new owner of this land. So what? Calm down, calm down! You'll not be cheated. How about a party to celebrate this discovery! A little ceremony for the chest's opening. - Oh, really? - Good idea. During the wait, you gentlemen can take a bath to relax. Let's meet again at night. And we'll party hard. A good bath and a party! Good night. Tonight, dinner is on the house! I am a little kitty. Enjoy it, everyone! Owner, you better start off quickly. Soon, they'll open the chest. Shiori! Excuse me. I saw you by accident. You were burrying a chest filled with pebbles. It must have been heavy. - You... - I can guess the rest. - In this case... - Get out! That suitcase is yours, alright. But the chest is an infraction. Start off quickly. Hurry! Let's be partners in crime. Understood. It's not possible! Why? - I don't understand. - Me neither. Good work! This is stupid! These are only rocks... So, the inn was not even yours? I had a hard time faking the documents. I spent many nights at it. - You're a pro! - I used to worked in real estate. I see. And me who thought you were a modest owner. You are an arrant liar. Speak for yourself. You're more tricky than romantic, I wonder why. It's true! Men are sweet dreamers. The idiots! THE END Translated by kagetsuhisoka Proofread by takeshi2010
