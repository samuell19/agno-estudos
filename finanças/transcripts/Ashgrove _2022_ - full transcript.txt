- And we're back. We're talking to professor of water chemistry, Dr. Jennifer Ashgrove, one of the many scientists around the world trying to find a solution to the water pandemic. Dr. Ashgrove, we know it's too late now to create a vaccine now that the entire world is infected with this virus. But can you explain to me what exactly are you and your team working on? - As we all know, this virus feeds on oxygen molecules in the water that we drink, making water consumption toxic and unfortunately, eventually fatal. So essentially, my team and I are looking for ways to bond the oxygen molecules more securely to the hydrogen molecules in the water we drink so the virus will starve and eventually, hopefully die. - You know, this time in history has been nicknamed the great paradox. We obviously need water to survive, but now if we drink too little, we'd dehydrate. We drink too much and the toxicity builds up in us and it can kill us. - Well, it really comes down to self-regulation here. The death rates are astounding, but they would slow down if people carefully rationed their water intake. - But you know, obviously relying on individuals to change their behaviors, often enough. I mean, the numbers, as you mentioned are astounding. That's 60 million people around the world have died and the rest of the population is now expected to perish within five years. Well, I know a lot of people are looking to you specifically to help get us out of this. I saw that the UK Science Journal reported last week, that of all the teams around the world, you might be the closest to a breakthrough. - That is flattering but I can't really comment on that now but I can promise you that I haven't taken a single day away from this work since the outbreak started and won't. - I know that you're married. And I imagine working a job like this that has such a demand on you every single day, what kind of toll does that take? - Uh, yes, well, it's all about balance and I think... In this situation, you make it work. You just, you find a way. We're doing okay. Oh my God. - Jenn? - I gotta go. Fuck, Frank, pick up. - This is Frank, leave a message. - Frank! Frank, Frank, I figured it out. Get the team together and meet me at the office in 45 minutes. I figured it out, Frank, I- Fuck, I figured it out. - Hey. - Hi. - How you doing? - Hmm. A little groggy. - Yeah. - Oh, I'm sorry. - No, don't be sorry. - I know, I slept a long time. - Hi, I'm Dr. Lakeland. Yeah, so you feeling okay, Jennifer? - Yes. - Okay. - So. - Sorry, this is- - I know, I know, I'm so sorry to sort of surprise you like that, I'm sorry. - Hmm hmm. - I'm sorry. But I just wanted to make sure that I could talk to you when you woke up. We've determined that you're suffering from a bit of a dissociative amnesia, which just means things, you know, before you collapse might be a little bit fuzzy. That's okay. And that's normal, guys. So I don't want you to worry about that. - Okay- - Some things. It's no problem. When you collapsed, do you know how much water you'd consume that day? - It was, uh, directly after lunch. So, 25. - Okay, great. So we can rule out any toxicity. Jennifer, I understand you have a bit of a history of having these like stress-induced blackouts. Is that correct? - Umm. Well, no, I don't think, a bit of a history, is a correct way to-- Well, I've had, there's been several times that I've lost time for a moment, but it's, it doesn't happen every day is what I'm saying. - Okay, and have you ever been hospitalized with those? - No, no, no. I have, I was in the hospital last year for four days. We had a miscarriage and so I, it has nothing to do with the blackouts. This was more... Personal. - Okay. Well, since you have what I would consider a medical history with these blackouts and because I know that you're under very extreme, like unimaginable stress right now, I think that what's going to be really great for you is if you take a little bit of time off, if you have a little bit of a rest, just a couple of days. I think that's going to be great for you and ultimately, great for everybody else. - You understand what I do for a living? Correct? - Yeah. - Well, then you realize that it's not possible for me to take any sort of break. I feel great right now. - Well, so, okay. So here's the thing. Because of the stress you're under and because you do have this history, my concern would be that these blackouts reoccur. So I think what's going to be great for you and it's going to ultimately help you do your job, is if we can reset your system a bit. I'm just talking about a weekend. You know- - Okay. - I'm not saying take a month off. Just like a couple of days. - Okay. - Is there somewhere maybe you could go where you could just relax, get away from everything? - Yeah. Yeah. We have a farm, her family farm. - Yeah. - That sounds great. - You're not supposed to be here. - Good morning, Frank. Just saving the world. I'll be out in 15 minutes. - Goddammit, Jennifer. - Don't goddammit, me. I'm not even here. - We have had this conversation. - Look away. - You just had a blackout. - Why are following me? - You had a blackout a month ago. I can't use you like this. Doctor's orders, you need to rest. - I'm not resting. I'm going to head upstairs to my office. You will barely notice me. And then, we can get back to work. - Why don't you go to that place you got in the country with your husband? - Sure. Every day, a hundred thousand people die but I'm going to go, head up and have a vacation. - Green team is still working on your new toxicity formula. Geneva needs two days to send them the bacteria results. You've got the time. - Who's going to run point man when I'm gone? For two days, who's going to take over? - This isn't a request. If you're still here in 10 minutes, I'm calling the MPs, have you sent home. - You gotta be kidding me, Frank. - Nine minutes, 58 seconds. - Frank! Frank! Sorry. - Who is gonna run point man? - Did I say point man? I meant point woman. - That makes it better? - Well point person. - All right. - Point people, if we could have multiple people running. - Quit while you're ahead, man, Jesus. - Okay, fill me in. - Bacteria patterning. You know what Snowmax is? It's the fake snow on ski hills. It's made using the bacteria, pseudomonas syringae. - Yeah. - Bacteria is amazing ice nuclear, right? You know that. So you take bacteria. And when it's in ice form, the molecules are more firmly bound together so the virus would have a hard time ripping it apart. So what we need to do is come up with a pre-ice. - And it could still possibly be digested? - I don't know, find out. I'll do some modeling over the weekend while you go away to the farm and then we can deal with it- - Elliot. Enough. What is your obsession with a farm, you people. - It's not an obsession with the farm, Jennifer. You need some time to relax. You need some time to just get away from this, okay? I promise you, if you go away for the weekend, I'll do this work. We'll revisit it Monday morning and I'll have some answers for you. Look, you're stuck. You need to stop thinking about it for a couple of days. And I don't know, maybe the solution will come to you. - Fine. But if I'm going to the farm, you're coming with me. - I'm not going to the farm. I'm gonna stay here. - Yes, you are. Just listen to me, please. You and Sam can come up for dinner. I can't do this alone. And I can't sit up there at that farm without you. - Yup. We'll go. - Yeah? - Hmm hmm. - And we will relax. And Jason will make a Colombian dish. - Colombian? - Yep, he's going to make a delicious Colombian- - Oh, goddamnit, that's good. Yes, get him to make a Colombian meal for me and- - It's going to be wonderful. And you're going to regret saying that. And it's going to be a wonderful weekend. - Hmm hmm, what are you going to do up there, over the weekend? - I don't know. I'm going to do whatever I need to do to let you guys know that I am okay and to get you off my back. I will be relaxed.

I'm not going to have a sandwich anymore. I don't really feel like one. I'm just gonna eat a salad. - Ah, I think you, why, are you sure? - Yeah. - Let me make you this sandwich. I really feel like you're going to like it. I've been working on my sandwich-making abilities and it's going to be the best turkey sandwich you've ever had. - I'm sure it is. I just, honestly, I just want a salad. - All right, look. This is silly, but, I baked the bread. I baked the bread and when I baked it, I imagined us, eating the sandwiches together.

I thought it'd be nice. Just at dinner tonight. - Well- - I don't wanna give them any sort of the artificial, weird sterile crap that they have in their registry. I just want to give them something personal. I thought it would be nice. And I think it's just a nice gesture to give them something that means something to us. Well, me. - No, us. No, no, us.

I don't want to do this right now. - Just hold on. It's like, you're saying we're never going to have- - I can't do this right now. - Okay, we haven't talked about it. I mean, it's been- - Not now. I just want to give them something nice. He lives in a fucking box. Please. Please just give me five minutes. I just-- - Just please don't make this decision until we do talk about it. You can have, take the time you need. But you, can we not, just make a call on it yet? Let's talk about tomorrow. - Okay. - Okay. - You need help? - You look beautiful. - You look beautiful. - No, I don't need any help. I got this. You do the table. I do the food prep. Everything is- - Situation and- - Everything's right on schedule. - I don't know that. - It is. - I don't want us to end up eating at like 11:30 at night. - That's not going to happen. - It happened once. - That was not my fault. That was a technical issue. It had nothing to do with me. - A little bit, your fault. You sure you don't want help? - No, I'm good. You set the table. - I'm done setting the table. - Okay, well just relax. You can hang with me, but I'm good. I'm going to do the chopping. I got this under control. - Okay. I think I'm just going to grab a salad. - What, no, no. There's no salad in this. This does not include salad. - It's just a salad. - Please, please, please, please. There's no salad in this. There's no salad. I've got everything organized. Everything is going exactly where it's supposed to go at the right time and I just don't want you messing with it with salad. - Okay, I'm not messing with it. I just wanted to make, it's okay. - I know, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - It's okay. What's going on? Jason? Hey. - I'm sorry. - It's okay. You just been a little weird lately about food and particularly the stuff with the sourdough and the sandwiches. The shit at the market with the pie. You've been chopping vegetables for like an hour and a half. You snuck upstairs to have that weird phone call. Little hushed voices. I heard you. - Oh no, that. I didn't want to- - And since when did we go upstairs with hushed voices? - I didn't want you to hear it. - Who were you talking to, then? - Richard calling me about, bugging me about pages. And I didn't want you to hear me have a work call 'cause I said no work calls. And I promised we weren't going to do that and then- - Does Richard often ask where I am? - What? - Why did you have to explain to Richard where I was in the house? And my exact whereabouts? - I don't think I did that. - I absolutely heard you say that. And then you got it and you're trying to work on it and you're trying to fix it. I'm sorry. The food thing is weird, I get it. I'm under a lot of pressure, okay? - Copy. Cool. - What I'm saying is- - No, I understand. You're under a tremendous amount of pressure. I know. You have a ukulele deadline coming. You're under pressure. I got it. You're under pressure. - It is not possible that I could also be under pressure? - It's not possible for you to be under the same amount of pressure. - Did I say- Did I say that I was under the same amount of pressure? - You used the word pressure. What possible pressures do you have in your life? - You know, what's- - To make you go so strange and crazy to sneak around and have strange phone calls to be so obsessed with food. - Jen, there's a lot going on right now, okay. - What is going on, then? - I'm trying to support you and be there for you. And I'm just, I'm constantly trying to lift you up. - That's your job as my husband! - You have no idea what I'm doing to help you find your cure, okay? - I have no idea? - I'm lifting you up, all the time. - You're doing nothing except playing the fucking banjo. - How can you say that to me! - And chopping vegetables, is all you're doing. That's all you ever do is sit on your ass. It took you 10 years to write a book. It takes you 10 years to do anything. Don't tell me you're helping me. Do you think I want to be here? - I don't want to do this anymore! - I don't want to do this anymore, either. - I don't want to do this anymore! - I don't want to do it either. Great, we're on the same page. - They're here! They're here. - Hi. Aww! Oh my God. - I know, it's been a minute. - Oh my God. - Hey, I'm coming in. Can I hug her first? It's okay, never mind. Hi. - How are you? - Great, how are you? - Good. - Oh. - Hey, welcome. - Congratulations. - How you doing? - Good. - You? - Good, what's that? - No, I'm just happy for you guys. - Dessert, my man. - Okay. - Two ounces of watermelon. One ounce of water. - Seems like a fair trade. Let's be careful with it, shall we? - What's happening, how you feeling? - I can smell something. - Good. - Yeah? - How you'd doing? - Good, I'm great. - I'm good, how are you? - Thank you for coming. - Of course. - Taking up a little more. - How was the uh- - How could I not come- - Be careful, careful with the steps! - She's fine. - How was the drive? - Please, let's not do that anymore, this weekend. - This is a very- - She's fine. She has to help me upstairs. - Precious cargo. - I'm so, so sorry. I really fucked up. - Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, so did I. We both did, right? - Yeah. - So, how's it going? - Not well. - Shit. God, is there any way we can just tell her? - Sammy. Sammy? Look at me. That is not an option. Do you get that? - Yeah. - We got this. You going to be a dad? - Yes, I'm going to be a dad. - You're gonna be a dad. - I know. How did that happen, Jennifer? - I can tell you. How do you feel? - Um. I, you know. Are you okay to talk about this? - Yes. - Seriously for real? - Oh, um, thank you. Yeah. Yes. - I'm going to have a kid. - I know. - In like three months. Come on, look where we live. Look, what's happening. How am I supposed to welcome someone into the world, knowing that? - You're going to fix this and you're going to do it with me. And so, the baby's going to be fine and you're going to be fine. It's okay to be scared. You should be. You'll probably fuck it up. You will fuck it up. - Thank you, Jennifer. - You're welcome. - How are you, really? How's the weekend going? - I don't know, I'm a little lost. - How so? - I just, uh. Before you came, we had a fight, just devolved into madness. And I said things and he said things and they were hurtful and they were bad and... - I think we got to give them some slack. I mean, both of them. Just think of the pressure they're under. They're trying to take care of us and connect to us. We're off doing, God knows what, in their eyes. They don't understand what we're doing. They just see what we're coming home, weighted down with every night. And they're trying to figure out how to love us. And that's... So he's been tasked with trying to give you a good weekend here, a relaxing weekend, a way to get rid of all the other stresses as best he can. And he doesn't understand that, that's impossible. He loves you so much. - I know. - Just try to give over to it, you know? And cut off some slack. - Thank you. - No problem. - Are we done? - Jesus. Come on. - I just want to know if it's over. It was nice. - So welcome to Colombia, is the unofficial national dish. So don't be intimidated by the number of dishes you see 'cause it all comes together on your plate. You can just start with rice. You're going to add red beans, which is cooked through with slow roasted pork. We've got ground beef, I've got a chorizo and more pork. Plantains, fried plantain, and then you've got fresh avocado. There's no right or wrong way to do this. - I just wanted to ask you traditionally- - Yeah. - This dish is served single serving. It's never served family style. So I'm curious about why you made the choice to do it this way. - I guess I'm giving it my own twist. Give me a fried egg. - The yolk is usually runny. - Ah, you really boned up on your Colombian food history, there. - I did, about 20 years ago. - He lived in Colombia. - Oh, you lived in Colombia? - We lived there. - So you actually, you've eaten the real thing. - Yeah. - How's it taste, though? - It's tastes great. - The Elliot stamp of approval. - Thank you, man. - You did it. - I appreciate it. - And most importantly, at least, we're not being served at 1:00 a.m. - Oh. - Is this never going to be forgiven? - No. - It was a technical issue. - I desperately want you guys to tell the story of your very first date. - I've heard enough about it. I don't know that we need to- - You need to hear the story, it's fun. - It wasn't a date. - It was, yeah. - It was a date and it was a kiss. - No. You leapt like Clark Kent into the crowd and suddenly started body surfing. It was just like hands on butts and boots and faces. - Hands on butts? - Oh, I mean, yeah. - People are propelling you. - 'Cause they're passing- - They're passing you from one to the other. - Oh, I thought you meant your hands. Your hands were on- - No. - That's another version. - No, it was like, yeah. - So you got pushed into kissing? You were forced into it. - Pushed into, yes. Physical contact. - And threw you into a passionate kiss. - It was not a passionate kiss. - And that was all we needed to know. That was- - The first one doesn't sound romantic. But was the second one romantic? The second kiss? - It was like literally two seconds. Tried again and it was- - It wasn't even a do-over. - So you remember that right? - You were trying to finish what you started? - And we could tell instantly- - And definitely. - There was nothing going on. - Nope. - Well, it's interesting, how many times you told the story. How come we're only hearing this now? - You never wanted to hear it before. - I heard some of this. - You find it amusing. - It's hilarious. - It's such a boring story. - You wanna maybe tell us about any other kisses? - Is there a third, or a fourth or a fifth? - Yeah, exactly. - Maybe we should go to a concert. - Yeah, let's go bang teeth. - I'm gonna try some of the crazy hot sauce. You wanna try it? - I'll follow you. - What is, the frig is this? I'll follow you, business? - The first summer after we hooked up, I had to leave. - After we hooked up. - Less romantic. - To go back to Winnipeg to work at my dad's store. - I thought we would, I did not think we were going to see- - Totally gone. - Until he came- - Taking the summer off. And then I get to my dad's. One of the first day, the first morning. Who walks in the door? The first customer in the door. And she said, I followed you. And this became our... It didn't become a thing until the next year when we graduated and you got into the master's program at UVic and I gave up my life to go and follow you. - You gave up your life? - Well, you know, brought my life with me- - With you, as I brought my life, yeah. - And that's the thing, - And then, we kept doing that. - And then you kept doing that. - Well, I went to Dublin for the PhD. - Followed her again and then again. And then you followed her again. - Well. There's reciprocity in the following. It's not just him sort of stalking me around the globe. - I understand, you're both following in love. - Aww. - It's a beautiful story. - Thank you. - Aww. - That's a good one. - Hmm. - Well, that's the story. - It's a good one. - It's a great one. - And I have no idea- - Thank you for sharing. - Thank you for asking. - I want more than five, though. Savor it. - Nice! - Try it again. - So, what- - Oh my gosh, I got it close. - Good shot. - Perfect. - Nailed it. - Yes. - Good point. - Oh, that was terrible. - Good effort, good effort. - One more time for the baby. - Good effort. - A for effort. - That was a half measure. - This is fun. - Nope, no, no, no. - You gotta redo. - Look over there. - You want some of this? - Okay. - You're counting your ounces today? - Don't worry about me. - Hmm. Measures out so we each get five pieces. You've had more than five pieces. - I know what I'm doing, okay. - It's gonna fuck you up if you- - I know what I'm doing. - Great. - Since I can't bend over. - Nice. - My turn. - Yep. - I wanna apologize for, um, something. I uh... I've just taken Elliot away, a lot for work. And I know that right now, you should be with your husband and- - It's okay. - And I felt bad about it. - No, please. - I know. - You have to do what you have to do. - Right. - It's fine. And I'm not alone. I mean, you've got Elliot. And I've got Jason. - Wait, okay. - But. Having lunch once a week does not make up for a missing husband. - And dinner and movies and card games and you know, whatever Jason wants to do. I'm like, okay. So, I'm far from alone. It's fine, please. Don't ever feel like you need to apologize. Oh! - So you'll go first, Sammy. You'll pick five questions out of the bowl. - Which family member annoys you? - Elliot, what'd you get? - That would be your racist uncle. - Yes, I'm going to go with uncle Tim, as well. He is racist and he is- - Your uncle Tim is racist? - Sorry. - And he was an inappropriate tickler. - He's not inappropriate. He's just a tickle monster. - Well, that's inappropriate. What do you got? - Your mom. - Well, I think Elliot would agree with that. - Hmm hmm. - What was your answer? - Uncle Tim. - Hmm, I get a point. Okay. Second question. - What I most like about the weekend? - Morning sex. I know this. I shouldn't- - Uh oh, Elliot. What'd you get? - My cooking is a favorite part of her weekend. - I'm going to go with the sleep in. - Yes, you're all right. - But what did you write down, as the question? - Lately, you know, it's definitely been the sleep in. - Ah. - But I'll take your cooking any day. Favorite smell. - Her favorite smell is Musk. - Hmm, okay. I also have Musk, but I'm doing, I'm guessing a three-way tie between Musk, Jasmine and lilacs. What do you got? - I said food. - So vague. - Not the worst guess. - No, mine's vague. Yours is very, very specific. - I'll tell ya what, I know I'm right and I'll tell you why. - It's pretty specific. - You know, right? - What did you say mine was? - It's Musk. - Okay baby, you're not wrong. But you're the most right. - So round two, how often would I like to have sex. - Don't care. - Every single day. - Hmm. - Probably twice a day. Maybe three times a day. - What did you write down? - I wrote every single day. - Every single day. - Every day. - Elliot, what do you think is my sexual appetite? - That's interesting, 'cause I actually down, half to one time a week. - Okay. Sammy? - Three times a week. - I wrote down three times a week. - But I'm sure that Jennifer is much more correct. - Every day would be splendid. - Yes. - I just. I didn't want to push it. I didn't want to push my luck. Okay. Four and... What is a skill that I have, that nobody else knows about? - Sweetheart, what'd you get? - I just only found this out recently. Playing the banjo. - It's a ukulele. Elliot? - Just grasping at straws here. Sleep doctor. - Right? - Why is that funny? - No, this is drinking too much watermelon and getting just a tad water toxic. So Sammy? - I know it's the ukulele. - You okay? - But another string instrument. - She meant ukulele, by the way. - I'm sure. - Yeah. - Number four. What is my favorite dessert? - I don't know. - My favorite dessert, come on. - What'd you write down? - Sam, tell me. - Well, I only know 'cause if it's not really, really warm, you send it back. - Ah! - It's molten chocolate lava cake. - But you knew this. She knew that, too. - I'm sure it's changed, but like for 20 years. - You know what guys, you don't have to explain and rationalize every answer, okay? You guys are good friends, that's fine. - Didn't know that was one of the rules, yeah. - Probably because you guys are just spending every day together. - Well, there's a whole thing with the smells. - See, this is what I don't I understand. If you guys have been spending all this time together. - Hmm hmm. - Are you writing? Where is, how you working on your book? - He hasn't touched it in six months. You know, been doing other things, right? Other skills, life skills. - Like hanging out skills. - Learning an instrument, right? - Yeah, um. Sorry, you said, you know, just because you guys have been going out to lunch, he hasn't touched his book in six months? - I mean, maybe he has. As far as I know, I don't know. - No, no, no, it's been off and on. I mean, it's- - Yeah. Well, yeah, we should go. - Yeah, we should- - I'll drive. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah, I'm fine. I can drive. - No. - I can drive, yeah. Easy does it. Step. Thank you, so much. - You're welcome. - Thanks for coming, guys. - That was a fantastic day. - It really was, guys. You knocked yourselves out. Thank you so much. Key? - That's good. - Okay. - See ya, Monday. - See ya, Monday! - Hey. - Hey. - Water, I brought your water up. You still have like, 10 left, even with the watermelon, so. That's good. - Thank you. - You got a good drink tonight. - Getting an early jump on the- What are you doing? - Don't ask me stupid questions. Don't do that. - Put your stuff- - Don't do that. - Put your stuff away. - Why have you been lying to me about your book? No. Why are you a liar? You've been lying to me about your book. You lied about Richard. You lied about hanging out with Sam every day. So I'm packing because I don't want to stick around to find out how much more you've been lying about. Why were you lying to me about your book? - Okay. I stopped writing because I, I haven't been able to, I haven't been able to write because I don't see a point in writing a stupid book about some civilization that nobody cares about it. And... - There's no point. - Yeah. - There's no point because we're not going to make it. There's no point because I, I'm not going to be able to fix it. Then, why the fuck drag me up here? If you think my work is pointless. If you think that I am pointless. If you think that what I'm doing is pointless. - No, no, no... - I'm pointless? - No! You're, you're... - You just said, it's pointless. - I just meant, it's hard to rationalize me doing something so meaningless when you're doing something so meaningful. - It's not what you've said. You said it's pointless. You said you didn't want to work on it because it's pointless, which means that you don't fucking think that I can do it. - You don't understand. - I do understand. - Babe. - Don't. I need you to believe in me. And you don't. And on top of it, you're fucking lying about it. Who are you? Why have you been lying about the copious amounts of time you've been with Sammy? Tell me the truth, because I think that you owe me that. - Yeah. So something happened between Sammy and I. - Hmm hmm. - One time. - Hmm hmm. - Earlier this year and it was one night and it was completely stupid and meaningless. And we do not feel that way about each other. And I love you so much. - Fuck you. - And it was a stupid, stupid thing and we both hated it and it was awful. - Fuck you. - And it was one time. - You bring her into my house where, when? - Their house, their house, you guys were working late. You and Elliot were working late, and... - When did this happen? - In February? It was February or March, I don't remember exactly. - Hmm hmm. - No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Don't even go there. It's not, it's not that. Honey, you gotta believe me. Please. - Oh my God. - No. - Well, congratulations, Jason. - No. - What am I suppose to do? I can't believe... Don't! Don't! I... Fucking hate you. - Don't say that, please, don't say that. - I don't! Fuck! - Did something happen? - I'm leaving you. That's what happened. - Can you open your window, please, Jennifer? Hi, Jennifer. I'm Dr. Lakeland, you remember? We met yesterday. I'm the neurologist. I know, they're fine. They're going to stay right there, okay. So Jennifer, I need 10 minutes of your time, okay. And then I'm going to tell you everything that's going on. - Now, is not a good time. - I know, it's not. Trust me, I know it's not a good time for you. I know it's not and I need just 10 minutes and I promise you, I'm gonna explain everything to you. So you and I need to go back in your house, please. - I'm not going anywhere. Who are those people? - They're going to move, as soon as we go in the house, they're going to go. They're just helping me right now. I know, I know. And I know it's the worst possible time for me to be showing up and doing this to you. - How do you know? - I'm gonna tell- - What do you mean, you know? - I'm going to tell you everything. I just want 10 minutes, okay, please. I'm trying to help you save the world, okay. I need you to give me 10 minutes of your time, okay? Yeah, go in, okay. Okay. So, Jennifer, what I want you to do is walk me through what happened in here with Jason, okay? Would it help you if he was in here? - Yes. - Okay. Okay. - Jason. - Yeah. - Can you come in, please? - Yep. - Okay, so, thank you so much. - Yep. - Both of you, okay. Here's what we need you to do. - Okay. - I'd like, you two, please, to walk me through what happened. - She was there and I came in with the water bottles and I-- I put hers here and, uh. I drank from mine and then I put it here. - And then he came over and told me that he was fucking our best friend. So, that happened. Is that what you're looking for? - Yeah, okay. So how did you feel when he told you that? - How would you feel? - It doesn't matter how I would feel. I want to know how you felt. - Like, I'm dying. Betrayed. And fucking angry and, heartbroken and I feel so stupid. I feel like an idiot for trusting you. I feel so stupid. I feel gutted. Like, I want to die, but like, I want you to die more. - And what did you say to him after he told you, what did you say to him? - I went- - Don't! - Please, please, just let him do it, okay? Let him do it, please. - I went for you. - I don't even remember. I don't know, he came and then I left and I went to the bathroom and I collected my fucking self because it was a moment. And then I went to the car and then you showed up with whatever bullshit this is. That's what happened. - Okay, we're going to do that, okay. Okay, you can do this. So tell me what you did when you came in here. - I closed the door. - And did you close it? How did you close it? What did you do next, Jennifer? - I grabbed, I don't know. I actually don't remember. I slammed something. Maybe like, I don't remember. - Do you remember what you were feeling? - Yes. I don't remember what I did. I don't understand what's going on. I don't remember what happened. I know the feeling if that's what you're asking me. - That's what I'm asking you. - The feeling? - Yeah? We're going to stop this, okay. Frank? You can come in, now. - What? - Dr. Lakeland. - Come on, sit down, please, Frank. - Jennifer. - So, Jennifer, I'm going to tell you what's been going on, okay. I want you to listen to me. And when you have questions, of course, you're going to have questions and Frank and I, we're going to try to answer them as best we can, okay. So, do you remember when you woke up yesterday and I told you, you were suffering from acute dissociative amnesia? Okay, so you had had a, like a stress-induced blackout and you forgot about two days of your life. So here's what happened in those two days. You came to this house with Jason. You had a lovely day together. You had a lovely night. The next day you went to the market and then your friends came over for dinner, Samantha and Elliot came over for dinner. They left and you and Jason went upstairs. Then you had a fight. You went into the loo by yourself. And while you were in there, you had an epiphany about the water crisis. We know this because when you left, you got in your car and you called Frank and you left him a message. And you told him that you had solved it, that you had figured it out. And you wanted him to get your team together. - No. - Yes. We don't know exactly what happened after that but you were found unconscious but unhurt on the side of the road. - Welcome back. - Why are you here? - What's the last thing you remember? - I was at the office and I ran downstairs to do some lunch. Had a hamburger. - That's it? - And a hash brown. - It was clear to Frank that you did not remember calling him. You did not remember having that epiphany. And you did not remember that whole weekend. So here's what happened, okay. You were medically sedated, safely. And Frank called me. Hello? - Dr. Rebecca Lakeland? Right now there's a team waiting for you outside your door with our verification documents. Take you to Auckland Airport and put you on a plane to come here. - I'm a memory specialist and the work that I do is around context dependent memory. The context or the situation that you're in, when a memory is formed, that impacts the way that that memory is retrieved. So I'm going to interview. I'm going to ask each of you questions individually, and I want you to think in terms of senses, okay. So go through, what did it smell like? What did it tastes like? What did it sound like? All those things. And also in terms of physical or emotional state, okay. So what were you feeling? What was Jennifer feeling? Okay, the fascinating thing about this kind of work is that a person moving through this sort of thing, 70% of the time, they're going to repeat the behavior. And if you feel her going off, that's where you sort of, as a group, you know, you get her back on. Okay, so can you walk me through what happened when Jennifer came into the office? - I just knew that she needed some time off. This isn't a request. - You and Sam are going to come to dinner. - We will go over dinner if buddy makes Colombian food. You're going up there just to kind of be buffered. - There's a piece of art, a statue that's by the front door. - You moved this. - She kind of pretended like she was okay with it, but I could tell that she was not. - Okay, and you said she was surprised to know that you had learned the ukulele. - You're sitting here on the couch and you're just sort of performing for the whole house. Do you want a standing ovation? It's lovely. Good job. - I think we had lunch after that. I think there was turkey sandwich with mayo and mustard. Yeah, so then we went for a canoe ride. We were having trouble finding the rhythm. It was a bit awkward. I'm not afraid of drowning in it. I just don't want to fall into it and get all wet and cold. We made a stir fry. And we have a routine when we make the stir fry and it's like a dance, almost. She fed me a piece of red pepper. Is she going to do that again? - Maybe, I hope so, I hope so. I hope so that she has the same impulses. - That'll be wild. - Yeah. - I knocked her water bottle over and before she could stop me, I opened it up and I dumped my water out. We made up a song. - What is this? - So we had an intimate moment, on the swing. She grabbed me and kissed me. - Okay. - This I remember, because this hasn't happened in a long time. So in the morning, I got up before she did. - Okay. - And I went downstairs and I made her a cup of coffee and we like to do a canoe, a paddle before we eat. And the water was amazing. - It was a nice morning? - Yeah, it was a nice morning. - Okay. - Went to the farmer's market. - Yep. - Get the pie? - I did. - It was an apple crumble with the caramel like drizzled. Hammock time. And she was reading. Well, then we started getting ready for dinner. - Pulled up in the back of their farmhouse. I remember that Jennifer went to Samantha first and said, hi. - She was really happy. Really happy to see me. - Jennifer and Elliot went for a walk to discuss work, I assume. - Do you remember the route you took? - Yeah, we were over by the fence. - Do you remember exactly what you were saying to her? - Are you sure? Is it okay to talk about this, really? I don't know if you know this, but, she had a miscarriage. - Yes. - Jason didn't mention that to you? - No he didn't. No, no, but we're just sort of walking through events. So if it didn't come up with him, you know, it wasn't a thing that would have walked me through. - Right. - And what did you talk about at dinner? - Normally, it's served single serving platters, as opposed to Ponderosa style. - Families. - That's true. - He's not wrong. - He's not wrong. - We criticize each other's meals. It's kind of a friendly competition thing. You can only find out so much on Wikipedia, right? So that's where we were. - Wow. - It was all in good fun, you know. Just teasing each other. - I still think it's crazy that the two of you dated. - Jennifer, for whatever reason, loves the story about the not date that Jason and I had. - It was the most awkward kiss. It was gross, actually. - It was gross? - Yes, it was. - Oh, thanks. - And after dinner, we played croquet. It was fun, but Elliot, he ate too much watermelon. - Okay. - Ah, fuck it. - I always bring a watermelon. It's a special treat. - Yeah, great. - Don't do that all the time. - And then we went back inside to play a game. Favorite smell. My answers are never straightforward, which Jason knows. - So Sammy knew more about you than Jennifer knew about you? - In this particular instance, yes. - And so how did Jennifer feel about that? - She didn't like that. Kind of highlighted that we haven't been spending a lot of time together and it made her feel uncomfortable and suspicious and jealous. - Okay. - It got weird. - Yeah, time to go. - So, she stormed in the house and went up to the bedroom? - She was packing. We had a fight. You're the scientist that they plucked from obscurity to fix everything. - But I can and I will and I- - I don't want you to save this world. My world is lonely and sad and useless. - Get away from me! - She asked me if anything had happened between me and Sam. We had sex one time- - Fuck you. - And I told her the truth. It was a stupid mistake. And if you want to make it all about that, then go for it. - I don't understand the point! I don't understand how you could do this! - You betrayed me first! You gave up on this marriage! You gave up on this friendship! You gave up on this whole thing! - I hate you. - Yeah, that's obvious. You've hated me for a very long time. - If you made mistakes in that fight, if you said things you wish you hadn't said, you gotta do it all like that, okay? - That's- - You can't fix it. So if you feel like you've fucked up- - That sucks. - No, it does. I know, but it's important that it stays there, okay. How long was she in there? - Not long, maybe 30 seconds. And then she stormed down the stairs and that was the last time I saw her. - And then I got this call. - Get the team together and meet me at the office in 45 minutes. I figured it out, Frank, I- - Here we are. - The next thing that's going to happen is we're going to wake Jennifer up. Jason and I are going to be there. And based on her reaction, I'm going to decide whether or not we actually go ahead with this, okay? If we go ahead, you're going to be contacted. So what we have been doing and what you have been experiencing for the last two days is a reconstruction of those days that you lost. And we did that because our hope is that by moving you through that again, you would come to the same discovery. You would have that epiphany. - Stop. And you would to remember. - Stop. - That didn't happen, okay? - Stop. - Yeah. - So you sent me here to put on a play? That's what you're telling me? That none of this was real? That 15 minutes ago didn't happen? That... You recreated this? - We didn't have a choice. - You didn't have a choice? - We wanted you to have the same thought and we wanted that to happen as organically as possible. - How am I supposed to get this out of my fucking head, what just happened to me? - It's okay, it's okay. You don't have to do anything right now, okay? So can I tell you one more thing? - I don't care what you want me to know. I don't care, I don't care, I don't care. This is so fucked up. You have no idea how fucked up this is. - No- - I don't know what's in my head! - I know, you don't. I know you don't. But it is in there and we're going to help you get it out. - So what now? - This is what we're going to figure out, okay? We are not going to do it right now. - You can take some time. Process all this. - You want to help me? - Yep. I do. - If you wanted to help me, you would have said something in the first place. If you wanted to help me, you wouldn't have done... All of you can go fuck yourselves. ♪ All the days forever gone ♪ ♪ For all the hope we settled on ♪ ♪ Fighting spear bound for dust ♪ ♪ Sorry for- ♪ - Okay, so I just got off the phone with the best hypnotherapy therapist around and she can be here in the morning. I think that is probably our best bet now to go that route. - Hypnotherapy has been known to implant false information. I can't trust it. - No, that's not going to happen with the hypnotherapy therapist that I've got but I feel like you probably have another idea, right? So what's your plan? - Cytidol. - What?

And while what you did to me was fucked up, I recognize that you thought it was absolutely necessary, so. I'm here. And I want to help you. I want to do whatever it is you need me to do. - Well, we have to go to the next option. - Which is? - There is a drug that's classified. It's called Cytidol. - Okay.

You. I need you to promise me that you are going to go off and be happy with your wife and your new baby. And live a very happy life because you owe that to me. You're not promising. - I promise. - Thank you. I have to go. I want you to finish up. Don't fuck it up. - I don't want to bother telling you how ashamed I am because I think that's really obvious. And this might be the weirdest thing to say but this had nothing to do with you. I've just been alone for a really long time. It's no excuse, but it's the truth. - I can see how you were lonely. And I can see how Jason was lonely. - The worst part about this is, I think I betrayed you the most and I wouldn't dream of asking you to forgive me. More than anything, I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive him. You're his whole world. He loves you more than anything. I think the thing that has come out of all of this is that I realized that there are so many different ways to love. You have hope. With or without me. Just know that I want you to be happy. And I'll see you on the other side. I miss you already. Hi. - Hey. They told me, they told me I couldn't call you. So I didn't call. - I know. - I'm... I'm really sorry about all of this. - I know. I don't have a lot of time. Last year when I was in the hospital, when I called you and I told you that I had had a miscarriage, I was... I didn't have a miscarriage, Jason. We didn't have a miscarriage. I had to make a choice. I couldn't do both. I couldn't be a mother and then do what I was expected to do. So I made a choice and I chose and I... And I'm sorry. Please.
