"AND ABOVE ALL, I WAS INTOLERABLY UNEASY "AT MAKING ANY FIRE, "LEST THE SMOKE, WHICH IS VISIBLE "AT A GREAT DISTANCE IN THE DAY, "SHOULD BETRAY ME. "AND FOR THIS REASON, I HAVE REMOVED "THAT PART OF MY BUSINESS WHICH REQUIRED FIRE, "SUCH AS BURNING OF POTS AND PIPES, ET CETERA, IN A MINUTE APARTMENT IN THE WOODS." - ATTABOY, LUKE. WAY TO GO. THAT WAS FANTASTIC. - YEAH, I MEAN, I KNOW THEY DIDN'T HAVE A FIGHT. LOOK, I'M GONNA ASK HER ONE MORE TIME, AND I WILL CALL YOU BACK, OKAY? OKAY, THANKS. ELSIE, THAT WAS NATALIE'S MOM. I KNOW SOMETHING IS BOTHERING YOU, AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO TELL ME WHAT IT IS. BUT I WANT TO WARN YOU ABOUT SOMETHING. NATALIE'S YOUR BEST FRIEND. AND THIS IS HER SPECIAL DAY. AND IF YOU MISS IT, I THINK IT WOULD REALLY HURT HER FEELINGS. - IT'S BECAUSE OF HER BROTHER. HE HAS A SNAKE. EVERYONE SAYS IT'S HUGE. AND I'M AFRAID HE'S GONNA TAKE IT OUT DURING THE PARTY. - OKAY, SWEETHEART, YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO. ALL RIGHT? - JEFF, WHAT? - UM... - IT'S OKAY. IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY, JUST SAY IT. - WHY DON'T WE TRY THIS? WHY DO YOU THINK HER BROTHER WOULD DO THAT? - BECAUSE HE KNOWS WE'LL SCREAM. - AND WHICH GIRLS IS HE GONNA IGNORE? - THE ONES WHO AREN'T AFRAID. - THAT'S RIGHT. IF HE DOESN'T KNOW YOU'RE SCARED, HE'S GONNA LEAVE YOU ALONE. THAT'S THE FIRST PART OF OUR PLAN. - SO I JUST PRETEND NOT TO BE SCARED? - MM-HMM. - WHAT'S THE SECOND PART? - YOU TEXT YOUR MOM A SECRET CODE. WE'LL COME TO THE HOUSE. WE'LL HAVE AN EXCUSE AND BRING YOU HOME, AND NOBODY WILL EVER KNOW YOU WERE SCARED. - WHAT'S THE SECRET CODE? - HMM. 2N? WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? - 2N. THAT'S FIREFIGHTERS' CODE. THAT'S HOW WE WORK. SOMEONE IS ALWAYS LOOKING OUT FOR YOU. - AM I OVERDRESSED? - PERFECT. - I THOUGHT YOU WERE GONNA GET A BABYSITTER. - YOU BOTH GOT CELLS? - THAT DOESN'T WORK. THEY CAN'T BE ALONE. - JEN, THEY'RE NOT GONNA BE ALONE. JUST LET IT PLAY OUT FOR A MINUTE. - YEAH, MOM, JUST LET IT PLAY OUT. - HEAR THAT? "JEN." - WHERE ARE WE GOING? WOW. OH, MY... - YOU THINK THEY'RE OKAY IN THERE? - YES. AS LONG AS THEY STAY OUT OF SIGHT. THE WORST OF IT WAS... WATCHING THEM WAIT AND WAIT, EVERY DAY ASKING, "DID DADDY CALL?" - HOW LONG? - 18 MONTHS, 26 DAYS BEFORE THEY FINALLY STOPPED ASKING. - I STILL COUNT. - COUNT WHAT? - HOW MANY DAYS IT'S BEEN SINCE THE FIRE... MY DAD. - WHAT HAPPENED? - HOW MANY 911 CALLS HAVE YOU TAKEN? - UM, I DON'T KNOW. THOUSANDS, I GUESS. - YOU EVER HAVE A CALL WHERE ONLY ONE PERSON SAID HE HEARD CHILDREN INSIDE? NOT ANYONE ELSE-- JUST ONE-- LIKE MY DAD'S FIRE? NO ONE MENTIONED CHILDREN INSIDE, NOT ON THE RADIO, NOT BY A WITNESS OR... ANYONE REPORTING... JUST THE ROOKIE PARTNER. - YOU THINK THE ROOKIE... - WAS COVERING A BAD DECISION. - OH, JEFF. - YOU KNOW, MY DAD, HE DIDN'T EVEN HAVE TO GO IN. I DON'T THINK HE SHOULD HAVE GONE IN. I DON'T THINK HE HEARD ANYONE. I THINK IT WAS A MISTAKE. - YOU THINK THIS ROOKIE LIED ABOUT THE KIDS 'CAUSE HE WAS COVERING FOR YOUR DAD? - YEAH. AS OF A MINUTE AGO... I THINK YOU KNOW MORE ABOUT ME THAN ANYONE ELSE. - TOLD YA. - ALL RIGHT, PEOPLE, PAY UP. A BET IS A BET. COME ON, GIVE IT UP. THANK YOU. I REALLY THANK YOU FOR YOUR MONEY. - YOU TWO THE BOOKWORMS? WELL, I'M THE DIRECTOR OF THIS FACILITY, AND I NEED TO SPEAK TO YOU BOTH IN PRIVATE. - WE'RE IN SO MUCH TROUBLE. - OUR READING JOBS ARE OVER. - WE GOT CAUGHT. - WE DON'T HAVE THE PROPER PAPERS, AND WE'RE DODGING TAXES, AND WE'RE SWINDLING THE GOVERNMENT OUT OF THEIR MONEY. - WE WERE STEALING MONEY FROM PEOPLE WHO ARE INCOMPATIBLE. - YOU MEAN INCOMPETENT? - THAT TOO. - IS THAT MY BOOT? - IT'S OUR TIP JAR. WE BORROWED IT. - WE NEED YOU TO CALL THAT ADMINISTRATOR LADY. - WHOA, WHOA, WHOA. HOLD ON. TIME-OUT. - SHE SAID OUR PARENTS HAVE TO CALL. - BUT SHE DIDN'T KNOW WE ONLY HAVE ONE. - AND SHE'S THE ONE WHO HAS TO MAKE THAT CALL. LOOK, WHY DON'T YOU JUST TELL YOUR MOM ABOUT YOUR JOBS? - SHE'D MAKE US RETURN THE MONEY. - AND WOULDN'T LET US GO BACK. - WELL, THAT'S HER DECISION TO MAKE. - WELL, YOU'RE NOT THE ONE WHO'S READING TO AN OLD BLIND LADY WHO'S WAITING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT HAPPENS NEXT. - AND BUDDY REALLY WANTS TO HEAR THE END OF MOBY DICK. HE'S NEVER READ IT. - BUDDY? YOU READ TO A MAN NAMED BUDDY? IS THAT THE SUNBRIAR RETIREMENT HOME? SHH. YES. YES, IS SHE THE ONE IN CHARGE? THEN YOU CAN PUT ME ON HOLD. THANK YOU. THEY'RE GONNA GO GET HER RIGHT NOW. WOULD YOU PUT THAT IN MY ROOM, PLEASE? YES, MA'AM. YEAH, I'M CALLING IN REGARDS TO LUKE AND ELSIE. I KNOW. BUT SHOULDN'T THEY AT LEAST GET TO FINISH THE STORIES THAT THEY STARTED? THEY'VE MADE COMMITMENTS. WELL, THEY'VE BEEN TAUGHT THAT THEY SHOULDN'T MAKE COMMITMENTS THAT CAN'T BE KEPT. LOOK, WHY DON'T I JUST COME DOWN IN PERSON AND WE CAN TALK ABOUT THIS? PERFECT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OKAY. BYE-BYE. - THANKS, JEFF. - DON'T THANK ME YET. - WELL, AT LEAST THANKS FOR TRYING. - WELL, IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO. - I DON'T KNOW HOW HE FIGURED OUT THE SNAKE THING. IT'S NOT WHAT I WOULD HAVE TOLD HER TO DO. I GUESS IT'S JUST SOMETHING A GUY WOULD THINK OF. - NO, HONEY, NOT ALL GUYS-- JUST KEEPERS. AND I KNOW A LOT ABOUT BOYS AND REPTILES. I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU DIDN'T CALL ME. - WELL, I CAN'T BELIEVE I DIDN'T HAVE TO. YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS. - OH, MY GOSH, THAT IS SO CUTE. WHERE ARE THEY? - ELSIE'S AT A PLAYDATE, AND JEFF TOOK LUKE TO A FIREFIGHTERS' COMPETITION-- A BOYS' THING. - GO, GO, GO, GO. - COME ON, LUKE. - YEAH. - COME ON, KYLE. - ONE, TWO, THREE... - 911.

WHAT'S YOUR EMERGENCY? - THESE ARE ALL THE FIREFIGHTERS WHO DIED IN THE LINE OF DUTY. AND THIS IS MY DAD. - YOUR DAD DIED? - YEAH... IN A FIRE WHEN I WAS TEN. - I ALWAYS WONDERED WHAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN LIKE TO HAVE A DAD... YOU KNOW, TO STRIKE OUT IN A BALL GAME AND HAVE A DAD THERE. BUT THEN ON THE WAY HOME, HE'D POINT OUT SOMETHING I DID GOOD... MAKE ME FEEL BETTER. THAT'S WHAT OTHER KIDS' DADS DO. - YEAH. I ALWAYS IMAGINED IT LIKE THIS. WE BOTH KNOW YOU DIDN'T PLAY WELL, BUT WHEN YOU AND YOUR DAD DRIVE HOME, HE'D TELL YOU IT WAS A BAD CALL BY THE UMP, THEN DO SOMETHING NICE... STOP FOR A MILKSHAKE. YOU KNOW WHAT I FOUND OUT? THAT THERE WERE OTHER GUYS WHO WOULD TAKE ME FOR THAT MILKSHAKE. - HEY. BAD CALL AT WORK? I'M SORRY. - I SHOULDN'T HAVE ASKED YOU TO TALK TO LUKE ABOUT YOUR DAD. HE'S NEVER REALLY HAD SOMEONE LIKE YOU TO LOOK UP TO... EVER. AND--AND ELSIE... SHE WORSHIPS YOU, AND I-- AND HERE'S THE DEAL, OKAY? THIS ISN'T THE WHAT-IF BUS ANYMORE. THIS IS WHAT IS. - OKAY. - THE BAD CALL I HAD AT WORK WAS AN OFFICER... IN A FELONY HIGH-SPEED PURSUIT. AND NOW SOMEONE IS KNOCKING ON HIS DOOR TO LET HIS WIFE AND KIDS KNOW THAT HE IS NEVER COMING BACK. - I WAS THAT KID ONCE. - SO YOU UNDERSTAND. YOU UNDERSTAND THE DANGER OF A KID HAVING A FATHER OR A FATHER FIGURE WHOSE LIFE IS ALWAYS ON THE LINE. - I UNDERSTAND WHY YOU DON'T WANT TO PUT YOUR KIDS OR YOURSELF THROUGH THAT. WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND IS... WHY YOU'RE LETTING THE WHAT-IF GET IN THE WAY OF THE WHAT-IS. - JEFF, COME ON. THEY ALREADY LOST A FATHER ONCE. AND I JUST DON'T KNOW HOW THEY-- HOW WE COULD GO THROUGH THAT AGAIN. - I LOVE YOU. I LOVE YOUR KIDS. - I'M SORRY. I'M SO SORRY. - COME ON, WE'RE GONNA BE LATE. MOM... WHAT'S WRONG? - WHY WOULD YOU THINK SOMETHING'S WRONG? - YOU'RE JUST STANDING THERE ALL STILL. - I THINK WE SHOULD TALK. - WHERE ARE YOU GOING? - TO THE DOCTOR. KEEP YOUR FINGERS CROSSED. HE MAY RELEASE ME TO GO BACK TO WORK. - BUT THAT MEANS YOU COULD GO HOME. - WELL, YEAH. THAT'S WHERE HE LIVES-- AT HIS HOME. - WOULD YOU STILL COME EAT HERE? - IF HE CAN GO TO WORK, HE'LL EAT AT THE STATION. - ARE YOU GUYS GONNA STAY FRIENDS? BUT YOU GUYS WHISPERED. - WHISPERED? - YOU DON'T WHISPER TO SOMEONE YOU DON'T LIKE. - IT MEANS NOTHING. IT DOESN'T WORK THAT WAY! - LUKE, COME ON-- - CAN I STILL USE OUR SECRET CODE-- 2N? - THIS IS WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT. - 911 EMERGENCY. - I HAVE AN IDEA. DO YOU GUYS WANT TO GO TO THE MOVIES TONIGHT INSTEAD OF THURSDAY? NOT REALLY. - YEAH. NOT REALLY. - I MISS HIM TOO. - HOW MUCH PAIN MEDICINE? - NONE. - OKAY, LET'S DO A FINAL CHECK, SEE IF YOU'RE GETTING YOUR HEARING BACK. - MY HEARING? - I FIND MOST FIREMEN WHO WERE INJURED END UP WITH HEARING LOSS. - REALLY? - LET'S CHECK THOSE EARS. WHEN I SAY "LIGHT DUTY," WHAT DO YOU HEAR? - LIGHT DUTY. - OH. GOOD. SO YOU DON'T HEAR ANYTHING THAT SOUNDS LIKE, "OKAY TO CLIMB A LADDER"? I'M SERIOUS. SOME OF MY FIREMEN PATIENTS THINK THOSE TWO THINGS SOUND THE SAME. - UNDERSTOOD. - YOU TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF. - GUYS? - YO, YO. WELCOME BACK, GIMPY. GOOD TO HAVE YOU BACK, BROTHER. - THERE HE IS. - HEY. WHAT'S UP, BRO? - WELCOME BACK. - NICE, HUH? - I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY YOU DIDN'T CALL ME. - WELL, I SPOKE TO THEIR FATHER. - THEIR FATHER? DID HE ACTUALLY SAY THAT HE WAS THEIR FATHER? - UH, NO... NOT SPECIFICALLY. BUT HE WAS A MAN, AND HE CAME HERE TO TALK TO ME ABOUT, AS HE SAID, THE PICKLE THAT THE MCCLAIN KIDS WERE IN, SO I JUST ASSUMED THAT-- - HE ACTUALLY CAME HERE? - YES. - PICKLE. I GUESS MY KIDS DIDN'T WANT ME TO KNOW, SO THEY CONNED MY FRIEND INTO, UH, COMING. WHAT DID HE SAY? - WELL, HE SAID THAT THEY HAD FIGURED OUT A WAY TO MAKE MONEY, AND IT WAS FOR YOU, BECAUSE YOUR HOURS WERE CUT. THE MAN, UM, SAID THAT THEY HAD BEEN RAISED TO SHOW UP FOR THEIR COMMITMENTS, AND THEY STILL HAD OBLIGATIONS TO TWO OF OUR RESIDENTS. HE ASKED THAT THEY BE ABLE TO FINISH OUT THEIR STORIES UNDER THE CONDITION THAT THE READINGS WOULD BE FREE. YOU KNOW, OUR RESIDENTS JUST ABOUT STARTED A MUTINY WHEN I SAID THE KIDS COULDN'T COME ANYMORE. OKAY, SO HERE ARE THEIR LAST TWO CLIENTS AND WHERE TO FIND THEM. - THANK YOU. - YOU'RE WELCOME. - "THE LAST RAYS OF THE SUN DISAPPEARED MUCH TOO QUICKLY. "I COULD BARELY MAKE MY HAND OUT IN FRONT OF MY FACE. "AND WHEN I DID, IT SEEMED LIKE SOMEONE ELSE'S HAND "WITH A SINISTER LIFE FORCE OF ITS OWN. "FOR WHAT SEEMED LIKE AN ETERNITY, "MY ROCKY PRISON WAS DARK AS BLACKEST NIGHT, AND MY THOUGHTS WERE FILLED WITH TERROR." - I'VE BEEN LIKE THAT... LONELY AND SCARED. - ME TOO. - WHEN WERE YOU LONELY AND SCARED, KID? - WHEN MY DAD LEFT, I GUESS... AND NOW TOO. I'M LONELY FOR SURE, SAD. - WHY'S THAT-- 'CAUSE THEY TOLD YOU YOU COULDN'T READ TO US ANYMORE? - YEAH. BUT ALSO 'CAUSE OF JEFF. HE WAS OUR RENTER. WE THOUGHT HE WAS GONNA BE MY MOM'S BOYFRIEND. BUT IT DIDN'T TURN OUT LIKE WE FIGURED. - WHY NOT? - HE SAID HE HEALED. HE WAS READY TO GO BACK TO HIS OWN PLACE. BUT I THINK SHE MADE HIM LEAVE. - WHY WOULD SHE DO A THING LIKE THAT? - I THINK SHE WAS SCARED. I MISS JEFF. HE WAS LIKE... LIKE MY DAD SHOULD HAVE BEEN. - AFTER YOUR DAD DIED, PEOPLE TRIED TO CONSOLE YOU. THEY'D COME UP AND SAY... HOW TRAGIC IT WAS... HE DIED BEFORE HIS TIME. YOU REMEMBER WHAT I TOLD YOU? - YEAH. THAT THEY WERE ALL WRONG. - EXACTLY. THEY WERE THE ONES THAT WERE CONFUSED. HOW COULD THEY KNOW IT WAS BEFORE HIS TIME, HUH? HOW COULD YOU KNOW THAT? MAYBE, UH, EVERYONE HAS... THEIR TIME. AND HOWEVER LONG YOU LIVE, MAYBE THAT'S THEIR TIME. YOUR DAD'S TIME WAS-- - 38 YEARS AND 7 MONTHS. YOU KNOW, THAT'S ALL FINE, BUDDY. I MEAN... I DON'T KNOW-- I GET IT. BUT HOW IS THAT SUPPOSED TO HELP ME NOW? - YOU'RE NOT A KID ANYMORE, JEFF. YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOUR TIME IS. YOU'RE NOT GONNA KNOW. I KNEW YOUR DAD BETTER THAN ANYBODY. AND THIS I KNOW FOR THE TRUTH. SEE THAT CHAIR? IF HE WAS SITTING RIGHT THERE, RIGHT NOW, AND YOU'D ASK HIM, "DAD, DO I TURN MY BACK ON LOVE BECAUSE I'M AFRAID?"... EVEN THOUGH HE WAS TORN AWAY FROM YOU, YOUR DAD WOULD SAY, "SON, DON'T RUN." HE WOULD NEVER WANT HIS DEATH, NO MATTER HOW TERRIBLE, TO STOP YOU FROM LIVING. - "OF COURSE THE LITTLE GIRL WAS SAD, "FOR HERSELF "AND FOR HER BROTHER. "THEY'D WORKED VERY HARD TO KEEP THE FIREMAN WITH THEM "SO THEY COULD HAVE A FAMILY AGAIN. "BUT SHE FELT THE SADDEST OF ALL FOR HER MOM, "WHO HAD FINALLY FOUND HAPPINESS "AND THEN SUDDENLY THROWN IT AWAY. "WOULD SHE EVER BE HAPPY AGAIN? "THE GIRL HOPED SO. HER MOM DESERVED IT." - OH, DEAR. - EVEN IF THEY WON'T LET US WORK HERE, CAN I STILL COME VISIT YOU? - OF COURSE, SWEETHEART. OF COURSE. - THAT'S TRUE. IT'S VERY WELL DONE. NICE PEOPLE. - YOU BOTH BROKE SO MANY RULES. YOU LIED. YOU VIOLATED, LIKE, A DOZEN LAWS. YOU TOOK MONEY FROM OLD PEOPLE. I AM SO... SO PROUD OF BOTH OF YOU. - HOW'S THE LEG? - ALMOST THERE. - BACK TO FULL DUTY? - CLOSE. - GO AHEAD. ASK ME. - YOU KNOW WHO I AM? - WELL, YOU'VE BEEN COMING HERE FOR OVER A YEAR. YOU'RE THE SPITTING IMAGE OF YOUR DAD... THE LAST TIME I SAW HIM. - WHAT HAPPENED? - I FROZE. - THAT'S WHAT THE AFTER-ACTION REPORT SAYS. WHAT REALLY HAPPENED? - I FROZE. - NO. NO, YOU DIDN'T. YOU READ THE SIGNS, RIGHT? THE THICK, DARK SMOKE, HIGH HEAT, ANGEL FINGERS, FREE BURN. IF YOU HAD GONE IN, YOU WOULD HAVE BURNED TOO. - WE HEARD KIDS... THE SCREAMING. HE WENT IN, BUT I DIDN'T. - NO, THERE WERE NO KIDS. MY DAD MADE A MISTAKE, AND YOU COVERED FOR HIM. - WE HEARD KIDS. - HE MADE A MISTAKE. - LISTEN TO ME, JEFF. I MADE THE MISTAKE. - A FLASHOVER IS MORE THAN 1,000 DEGREES... 1,000. WE BOTH KNOW YOU GOT TWO SECONDS TO GET OUT. - BUT IN THOSE TWO SECONDS, I MAY HAVE SAVED YOUR DAD. - ABOUT ZERO CHANCE. - BUT IT WASN'T ZERO. - BUT AT LEAST ONE OF YOU LIVED. - SURVIVED. ONE OF US SURVIVED... BUT NEVER LIVED. I LEFT MY PARTNER TO FIGHT ALONE. HE DIED INSIDE. I DIED OUTSIDE. - THANK YOU. - FOR WHAT? - FOR LETTING ME BLAME YOU INSTEAD OF MY DAD. - COME ON, GUYS, IT'S STILL A SCHOOL NIGHT. WE GOT TO GO NOW, OR IT WILL BE TOO LATE. - COMING. - OPEN UP, MA'AM. WE GOT AN EMERGENCY. WE GOT A FIREMAN DOWN. HE'S REALLY DOWN. - YOU WANTED A WHAT-IF. WELL, WHAT IF WE DON'T DO THIS? WE COULD MISS AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE OUR LIVES-- ALL OUR LIVES-- - BETTER? - MORE THAN BETTER... THE BEST. - WHAT IF EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED TO ME AND THE KIDS HAPPENED FOR A REASON? THAT REASON BEING THAT I WOULD BE STANDING HERE... AT THIS EXACT MOMENT. - YOU REMEMBER WHAT TWO-IN MEANS? - GO IN TOGETHER, YOU STAY TOGETHER, AND YOU COME OUT TOGETHER. - AND I WANT TO HAVE THAT TIME WITH YOU. - I WANT THAT TOO, COWBOY. THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.
