(bright electronic music) (lighthearted piano music) (plane whirring) (announcer speaking Spanish) - Excuse me. Thank you. Oh, great. Thank you very much. I can't do anything for myself. Broke it climbing Mount Chimborazo down in Ecuador. Thanks a lot. Really appreciate it, I'll be fine now. Thank you. (security officer speaking Spanish) (announcer speaking in Spanish) - How long are you gonna stay in Mexico for? - Just half a week. - Do you have anything to declare? - No, nada. (light music) - Okay, all clear, you can go through. - Thank you. (announcer speaking Spanish) - [Announcer] Attention, please, attention. Will passenger James- - Senor. - [Announcer] Please report to the immigration office. (tense music) - Senor. Come with me. (dramatic music) - Look, there's no need for this. (groaning) It's broken! I got x-rays, I got a letter from my doctor! You don't have a right to do this! (jazzy music) Really. (drill whirring) There's nothing there! (drill whirring) (jazzy music) (bright jazzy music) - Cocaina. (speaking Spanish) A lot of cocaine. (speaking Spanish) (upbeat jazzy music) - I would like to call the American Embassy. May I please do that? (smacking) - Embassy. All these hippie gringos. (speaking Spanish) Who are the others in the padrilla? The names. The names. - There's no names. - You got to tell me everything. - Hey man, look, there's nobody else! Look, I was stupid, huh? I was muy stupido, and I'm sorry, okay? (water splashing) I'm really sorry. (jazzy adventure music) (metallic buzzing) (Dwight screaming) (dramatic music) (officers speaking Spanish) (officer speaking Spanish) (group laughing) - My name's Roger Brody, can we try to stick together? - Sure thing, Dwight Worker. - Dwight. - You will be placed in the Dormitorio H. Do your work, obey the rules. If you do this, you will stay out of trouble. - Excuse me, Colonel Fuentes? - Fuentes. - Is there gonna be a hearing, or something? I mean, we haven't even been formally charged. - It is not my problem. - Well, can we at least call the Embassy? I mean, our families, they don't know where we are. - You should've thought of that before you imported dangerous drugs into our country. (speaking Spanish) - Wait a minute! This guy, he took our watches, and we'd like them back. - You can keep it, I don't need it. - Let's get a receipt. I mean, after all, it's our property. - Your property? You took our property! You damn gringos! You stole everything from us! - Look, all I want is to make a phone... (Dwight groaning) - You will be here a long time. And you will have a bad time here. (speaking Spanish) (boots shuffling) (dog barking) (gentle Latin music) (man snoring) (mice squeaking) (group snoring) (Dwight yelling) (Dwight thudding) - Hey, I see your mama tonight, gringo. (group laughing) - My shoes. (men laughing) (men chattering) (Dwight speaking Spanish) Hey! (group laughing) (group jeering) (light rhythmic music) (men yelling) (upbeat music) (group yelling) (upbeat adventure music) (bodies thudding) (group yelling) (men yelling in Spanish) What's going on? (men yelling in Spanish) - They're called fahines. We gotta clean the mess hall. - In the middle of the night? It's ridiculous. - (chuckling) Now you've got it, Jack. (group speaking Spanish) (whips cracking) (group yelling) Just keep at it, you don't look up. Because the mayora's got his beady eye on us. - Who? - Gardner-Pasqual. - Yeah? Which guard is he? - (laughs) Hell, he ain't no guard, he's a prisionera just like us. Only he lives better. (men yelling) - Which one is Dwight Worker? - There, Jefe. - How long does this last? fahines, I mean. - Two hours. And you do it three times a night. (laughing) Hell, you do it all day long if they say so. All the new guys do it. The only reason I'm down here with you peasants is because my old lady was late with the check. - You mean a bribe? - Pay the rent, Jack, that's the message. Pay the rent. (men yelling) - We'll do it for you, Gardner. - (speaks Spanish) You kill him, no one makes a dime. Tell Fuentes we're gonna do it our own way, okay? I got a business to run here. - Hey listen, man. Do we even get a trial? - (laughing) Don't hold your breath. (laughing) - Man, I was dumb. I guess I'm gonna have to serve some time, huh? - Yeah, I guess so. - But look, how long? I mean, what do you think? - I don't know. You're a coke dealer? Figure, seven, no, in your case, probably 15. - Look, man, I never even did it before. (Jack laughing) Man, they can't lock me up for 15 years! - Do your time, man. Do your time, man, and leave me alone. (loud banging) (men yelling) (crickets chirping) (horn blowing reveille) (door squeaking) (guard speaking Spanish) (horn blowing reveille) (guards speaking Spanish) (light music) - Senor? - Huh? - What is it? - It's called rancho. - Yes. But what is it? - Everything. Hooves, tails, I got an ear once. (light music) - There he is, the notorious Dwight Worker. God, he looks bloody awful. (laughing) - What do you want? - Only to make your stay in my country one big fiesta, senor. Enjoy your authentic native dishes served in colorful, old world surroundings. (speaking Spanish) (guard speaking Spanish) Your friendly, courteous staff. - Look, man. Who the hell are you? - J.W. White. I'm sort of a special advisor to the gringo prisoners. Let's start with your father. What do you suppose his yearly income is, approximately? (men cackling) Here you are, Dwight. Right out of Better Cells & Gardens. And it's all yours. All your need is a little help from your friends. (group laughing) (speaking Spanish) - I can't pay. They took all my money. - Allow me, por favor. (speaking Spanish) (food sizzling) - Hey, Worker. Price is $2,000. (speaking Spanish) You don't pay it, you work 18 hours a day. - Look, I got no money. - Phone calls home are on the house, Dwight. - The buddies there need to pay. Now they're gonna have a good... Tell him. Hey, Worker. My brother-in-law, Leif is a lawyer. He's got friends up in 3rd court. He can get you and these two gringo friends of yours outta here in libre, for three grand a piece. So, you're gonna pay me five grand. Two for your cell, three for your freedom. Hey, that's cheap for freedom, man. (jazzy Latin music) (food sizzling) (dramatic music) - Hey, where you goin'? - I wanna get back down there before they run out of rancho. (dramatic music) - Roger Brody, go talk to your friend. - Hey, Dwight? Slow down! Dwight! Dwight, wait, wait, wait, wait. Hear me out, will ya? Look, the dude's heavy, man. I mean, he can open doors for us, you know what I mean? Huh, you know what I mean? So, look, he gets you a lawyer, and you can be out in a week. You gotta have faith, man. - Rog, I met a guy last night doing six years. Busted with two joints. - I got more than that. - Yeah, you look kinda wrecked up there. - (laughing) It's dynamite dope. It's gotta be gold. I mean, if we gotta stay in, we gotta stay high, right? (laughs) You dig it? Score. I can get lots more where that came from. (men speaking Spanish faintly) - Gardner-Pasqual? Roger, don't you know what those guys think of us? Guys like Gardner, they think we're punks, man. That we'd sell our soul for protection, decent food, or a little dope. - [Roger] No. - Hey, I don't mean you. - Sure you do, yeah, you do. Hell, Dwight, I'm selling outta here, I know it. - So... Make 'em work for it. Don't give in so fast. Don't you see? Huh? (gentle music) - Hey, Dwight? I thought you said we'd stick together, remember? - I'll let you out of that one. Okay, Roger? (gentle music) (whips cracking) (men yelling in Spanish) (dramatic music) (men yelling in Spanish) (whips cracking) (tense music) (door creaking) (man speaking in Spanish) - [Man] No, (speaks Spanish) Dwight Worker. (tense music) (dramatic music) (whip cracking) (man yelling in Spanish) (lighthearted Latin music) (group speaking Spanish) (man speaking Spanish) (crowd chattering in Spanish) (lighthearted Latin music continues) (group laughing) - Hey. - What do you want for these? - Hey. So, what's going on anyway? - It's general visiting day. - [Dwight] Is it always like this? - Yeah. (man speaking Spanish) - He's been told not to talk to you, like all the others. - So you better split. You might get in trouble. - I've been here a long time. He must break you pretty soon, otherwise some others might get ideas. - I'm bad for business, huh? - More than that. You make a fool of him. You threaten his machismo, and this is everything which defines him as a man. Perd√≥name. Jaime Valdez, Venezuela. The cult of the machismo is a serious problem amongst Latinos. We will discuss it some time, if you live. (lighthearted Latin music) (group speaking Spanish) (man speaking Spanish) - I think I can get you out, but it will cost you a lot of money. - How much? - $5,000 down. - I don't have $5,000. (man speaking Spanish) (woman laughing) - [Lawyer] But you can collect it from your parents. - No. - Hey, Rog. - But your father paid for a private cell and you haven't got one! Don't Gardner-Pasqual me, I'm not afraid of him. I will not cool it! I will not! Where is this insect? (man speaking Spanish) (baby crying) - Excuse me. Could you do me a favor? - If I can. - I wrote a letter to my folks. But if I mail it from here, I'm just- - Of course. - Actually, it's two letters. - I see. You wrote one to your girl? - Oh no, the American Embassy. All about how they shake down Americans in here. - Oh, yes. I'm sure they'll be shocked and horrified. Do me a favor, young man, look around. Do you see any suggestion boxes? Is there a sign saying "We welcome criticism?" - I know. But still, will you do it for me? - Naturally. I adore lost causes. Why else would I live in Mexico? - (chuckles) Thanks. Thanks a lot. - Ooh, senor, I swear I don't know how those got there. Somebody must've planted them on me. (chuckling) - Thanks. - See you, pal. - Wait a minute. What's your name? - Lily Levinson. - Thanks, Lily. (magical music) (feet shuffling) - Hey, Worker. You're gonna pay me. I'm not gonna play with you no more, you gotta pay. - Look, I'm sorry, okay? But I just haven't got any money. - You get it from your father. - No. - Don't say no, I don't want to hear no. Look, Worker. All you have to do is promise, that's all. Yeah, you write it down what you owe me. I'll let you off fahines, starting tonight. - I don't know what he told you, but my father's not a rich man. He works hard. He's a hard working man, just like most the guys in this place. - Everyone has something put away, Dwight. - Huh. Savings account? He can cash in his life insurance. - Yeah, why should he? I mean, God almighty, he didn't put me here. It's not his fault. - Causing me problems, mano. - So, work me 'til I drop, huh? Or have your boys beat me up again. Hey, with a little extra effort, man, you can even kill me. But you won't get your money. - Dwight, you're not being very smart. - You're scum, man. And you stay the hell away from me. (dramatic music) - No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Let him go. (tense music) Rafael. - [Rafael] Yes? - I... I give up. (tense music) - Dwight, Dwight. Dwight, Dwight. Dwight. Dwight, are you awake? How are you feeling? I'm Jack Branch, vice council for prisoner affairs. - From the American Embassy? - All right, now, I can't stay too long. So, if you wanna get started? - Sure. - Here. (Dwight groaning) - Oh, God. I don't... Where do I begin? I've had no trial, no sentence. I'm just in here. - Yes, I believe you did sign a confession. - They used an electric cattle prod on me. I'd have signed anything. - We've had these claims before. - Claims? - Yes, and you see, the problem is, they're almost impossible to substantiate. - (laughing) Hey, man. I've been beaten, starved, worked half to death! - Oh, come on now, Dwight. The comandante told me all about it. - Comandante? Hey! It was his goons that worked me over. - That's a nice way to talk, young man. No wonder you got yourself in trouble in here. - [Dwight] How did I do that? - You know very well how you did that. You insulted the flag, you insulted this country's flag. (Dwight laughing) Oh, that's funny, isn't it? - Yeah. - You people, you don't care about anyone except yourself. You don't know what it means to be patriotic. - Oh, excuse me, I'm sorry. Excuse me. - Oh no, you excuse me. Please, I've stayed too long, and I certainly hope you recover. - Thank you, Mr. Branch. Mr. Branch, I feel great. You really did cheer me up! (laughs) Unbelievable. (Dwight laughing) (suspenseful music) (paper crinkling) (sighing) Okay, okay. Hi, Mom. How are you doing? How's Dad? I'm fine. No, really, I'm just fine. Hey, Dad. You're there all the time? How are you doing? Aw, that's great. No, I, no, Mom, don't let him come. Please. No! You know, it's just... His bad heart and all. Now listen, listen! About the money. The money. It really is quite important. Send a thousand, a thousand now, and then just monthly installments. Dad, I'm so sorry to ask. I know, but I know how tough it's gonna be. (somber music) Yes. Yes. I love you too. (somber music) (tense music) - Don't be late, Worker. You're gonna pay me right on time. (tense music) All right. - Dwight Worker! (speaking Spanish) - I wish we could see him out here. I thought there'd be like a visiting room. Hey! Worker. (guard laughing) (speaking Spanish) What'd he say? - He wants a bribe. - Oh, quanta? - Steven! - Cinquenta, 50 dolares. - Veinte. - Cuarenta, 40. - Veinte cinco, no mas. Give him 25. - All right. Say 20, five, here you are. That's highway robbery. (metallic clanging) (door squeaking) (guard kissing) (guard speaking Spanish) (Barbara speaking Spanish) (inmates laughing) (door clanging) - Thanks for coming. Hey, what happened to your beard, huh? - Oh, I shaved it off. - He shaved it off so they'd let him in here. - Aw, Steve. - Hey, hey. I forget my manners. Barbara Chilcoate, Dwight Worker. - Hi. - Hi. (coffee trickling) Thank you. - There you go. - All the comforts of home. (cat meowing) - Olivia always gets grouchy without her morning coffee. (Barbara laughing) - [Steven] You have much trouble getting stuff? I mean, coffee, books? - It's always a problem. I'm lucky, though. I got a friend. (cat meows) Lady named Lily Levinson. She lives here in Mexico City. Has a nephew here, in Lecumberri. And whenever she comes to visit him, I always get a little something. Last time it was crunchy peanut butter. (group laughing) - No kidding. - Yeah. Oh, I ate it up, I was just a maniac, you should've seen me. (laughs) Next time she's gonna come she's gonna have to bring me some dental floss, you know? (group laughing) Where did you ever learn such filthy Spanish? (laughs) - (laughs) Well, sort of self protection. We've been traveling in Latin America for a year. - We, meaning you two? - No. - It's not like that, Dwight, unfortunately. We have mutual friends down here, and Barbara found out I was gonna visit you, so, she asked to come along. - Why? - Well, I did a report once on Pancho Villa in high school. He escaped from this prison. - Did he really? I didn't know that. Hmph. We can't really stay long. We got a bus to catch. - Pancho Villa was the only one to escape from this prison. I'm gonna be the second. - Sure, sure. - I'm getting out of this place, Steven. - Dwight, you're not seriously, I mean, I know it's only natural to think about it, but hey man, if they... - If they catch me, they kill me. - Steven, I did wrong. I was punished. I can accept that. What I can't accept is a system so damn rotten that it extorts money from my mother and father just so I can stay alive! Hey. I got my health, my sanity back. I'm left alone. I can plan my escape down to the last detail. That's what they've bought me. - I'm philosophically opposed. - Yeah, yeah I know. You too? - I think if it was me, I'd have to try it. I couldn't let them win. - Barbara, what are you telling him? What are you saying? - Are you gonna be around? - No, we're going home in two days, we're out of money. - We, you keep saying we. - My traveling companion. Her name is Gabrielle. She's four and a half, and she's my daughter. - Gabrielle. That's a beautiful name. (soft music) - We really have to go. (Barbara chuckling) - Ah. The lost city of Machu Picchu, in Peru? - Mm-hmm. - Gotta walk through the jungle to get there. I climbed every inch of those ruins. I really know it, it's in my hands. Oh, does that sound weird? - No, no, I know just what you mean. - Oh, God. I wish... I'd like to show it to ya. Someday. - I'd like that. (gentle music) (metallic rattling) - Thanks for coming, Steven. - Take care of yourself. (gentle music) - Thanks for coming. It's nice to have met you. - You too. (gentle music) (door creaking) - Barbara, turn around. I love you. (gentle romantic music) - [Barbara] Dear Dwight. We're heading home now, and I just wanted to tell you how much I enjoyed our... (pen scribbling) Our first meeting certainly was... (pen scribbling) (light music) I wanted to tell you... (pen scratching) (paper crumbling) (light music) - [Dwight] Dear Barbara, it's been three hours and 27 minutes since I said goodbye to you. I keep thinking there must be some mistake. I'm not supposed to meet the woman I love in a Mexican prison cell. And I know what it sounds like, another lonely convict falling for the first woman who walks into his cell. Maybe it's true. All I know is, I'm alive again. - [Barbara] Our letters must've crossed in the mail. Yours arrived today. I can't pretend to be surprised. - Vasquez! - [Barbara] I had a feeling we'd be writing to each other. - Worker! (light music) Sanchez! - [Dwight] (laughs) And it was absolutely unbelievable. I went crazy with joy. God, I've got so much to tell you. - [Barbara] Of course, it's perfectly normal for you to react this way. But what about me? I'm not in prison, and yet, I do seem to think about you. I think of you all the time. I wish I could be there to see you, reassure you. I know what the stakes are, and I know the terrible risks you have to take, but I meant what I said. I support your decision. You must try to be free. - [Dwight] Well, after this, I want my life. I want you, and me, and Gabrielle, together on a beach somewhere. The sky is blue, the sun is hot, and we're free forever. By the way, I got my sentence today. Seven years. It makes me more determined than ever. I'm going to get out of here. - [Barbara] And the more I think about it, the more I'm convinced. I've saved some money, talked to my folks, the tickets are bought, bags packed. I even sold my motorbike. That's the point of no return. I'm on my way, love. I'll be there. (soft romantic music) - [Dwight] Three more days. No time at all. Writing this only to read each word to you. Barbara. Barbara. (romantic piano music) - Dwight Worker! (speaking Spanish) (light piano music) (joyful romantic music) (gentle romantic music) (horn blowing reveille) - If that's the calvary, they're too late. (Dwight laughing) Does that mean I have to leave? - No. We have about an hour. (kisses) Hey. Did you have to pay to get in today? - Yes. $25. - Damn. - Oh, it was worth it. - You'll be broke before long. I mean, what you need is one of those defensor's passes. That way you can come in every day. - Sounds great. (both laughing) - Lily could get one, I'm pretty sure. The thing is, you have to have a special reason for the privilege, you know, like being a lawyer, relative. - Fiancee? (romantic music) - Or a fiancee. - Well, then that's settled. Can they marry us right here? - Yeah. Barbara, are you sure? I mean, maybe we should wait. - You know what I could do? I could get one of those Mexican wedding shirts, and put fancy embroidery all over the back of it. (both laughing) - Oh, I love you. - You must be about a medium, right? - I love you. (both kissing) - I know. (gentle romantic music) (horn honking) - Ah! (Lupe speaking Spanish) Gracias. - De nada, senora. - Well, blessings on you both. - Thank you. - With one tiny reservation. This comes under the boring heading of frank talk with an older person, all right? - Sure. - It is not unique. It has happened before. A girl comes down here, meets a boy in prison, they write to each other, and sometimes this correspondence deepens into love, or seems to. At any rate, she returns to Mexico just to see if it is the real thing. - Sounds familiar. - Doesn't it, though? You know, there is an Earth mother in almost all women, and nothing brings it out faster than the sight of a bright, sensitive boy locked up in a filthy prison cell. - True. But if you, as an older person, are immune to that syndrome, then why have you been visiting Dwight and your nephew? - He's not my nephew, you know. David is the son of an old friend, a very old friend. Once upon a time, 1957 in fact, we ran away to Mexico together. He was going to paint, and I was going to be there for him. Always. (chuckling) Only, it turned out that he didn't need me for always, he only needed me for 10 weeks, a summer in the sun. At the end of which, with many tears of remorse, he returned to his wife in Pennsylvania. - And you stayed on. - Right. And you know what happened? 20 years later, I get an agonized phone call. "My son David, arrested for smuggling dope. "Help him. Forgive me." - And you call me an Earth mother. - That's not the point. (chuckling) - The point is, I'm in love with Dwight. I know what I'm doing. I am not running back to Indiana like a frightened little schoolgirl. - You wait. It can be hell, and it can be expensive. - I'm a nurse. If we run out of money, I will find a job. And tomorrow, Gabrielle and I will find a place to live. - Oh, don't be silly. You can stay here, you should stay here. I mean, at least until you're settled in. It'll be better for Gabrielle and I have lots of... Oh, Barbara, please. - Okay. - Good. You know, it's just that I don't want to see you hoping for an early release. I mean, we'll try everything. We may even have to bust him out of the place. (chuckling) Funny. I did think about it once. Escape, I mean, in connection with David. That was before he was transferred to Santa Marta. You couldn't do it there but, at Lecumberri... - What? - Oh, it was just a theory I had. It's an old prison, and the security system is still based on human beings, not on machines. - Well, whatever they have, it sure seems to work. - Oh, sure, sure, I know. It's their pride and joy. Nobody has escaped from the prison since Pancho Villa, et cetera. But, did you ever notice how thoroughly they search you when you go in, but when you leave, they hardly give you a second glance? You could just be any woman visitor. Nah. (laughing) It would never work. Well, I may as well go out and see how dinner's coming along. (mysterious music) (lighthearted piano music) (horn blowing reveille) - Buenos Dias, Senora. - Buenos Dias. (light music) Gracias. (baby screaming) (light music) (baby continues screaming) - Buenos Dias, Senora. - Buenos Dias, nina. (woman speaks Spanish) (Barbara speaking Spanish) - [Gabrielle] Gracias. (light music) - Nombre? - Barbara Chilcoate. (speaks Spanish) Dwight Worker. (guard speaks Spanish) (Barbara speaks Spanish) (lighthearted music) (lighthearted music continues) (metallic clanging) (door squeaking) (guards laughing) (suspenseful music) Okay. There are five actual checkpoints that you have to get through. The first one is here, it's the entrance to this dorm. (cat meowing) - Barbara. I really appreciate what you're doing. - But I don't know what I'm talking about, right? - I didn't say that. - I'm being presumptuous. You have two years to sit and think about it, and I come barging in here with a plan of my own. - No. That's not it. - Well, what then? - Well, it's just I feel uncomfortable about it. You know, it's not me. - I can't believe what I am hearing. Okay. Fine. You know, you are the one that stood up to those gangsters. - Yeah, for a while. - They respect you, even Gardner-Pasqual- - Shh. (metallic clanging) - Lily told me so. You are the last person they'd ever suspect of doing something like this. - It's just I've worked so hard on the other thing. Stealing stuff, for rope. I've got a contact. Up on F dorm, he can get me a guard's uniform. I know I can get on that wall. - So, you get up there. What if you meet someone? Another guard. You'd have to hit him pretty hard. You'd probably have to kill him. Now, all I am saying is that this way is safer. - I don't think I can do it. - Can I just show you? - Sure. - Okay. This is the first checkpoint, the entrance to this dorm. (door squeaking) - [Dwight] Okay. What if Tierno is on the gate? He's not very fond of either one of us, you know? - [Barbara] Well, we'll just have to pick a day when he's off duty. And you'll have to be really good. Checkpoint two is the Rondin gate. No problem here. They barely look at you. The trick is to wait for a crowd to gather, maybe another dorm that's having a general visiting day. (crowd chattering) This is the tough one, checkpoint three. Here, you turn in your metal tag, and the guard gives you back your paper pass. There's lots of noise, confusion, that'll help. And obviously, we've gotta get you a tag and a paper pass. Somehow, some way. Number four, the paper pass return. Not too bad, really. He looks at the date and his own signature, which I will duly forge. I'll have to do it from memory. That'll be hard. But at this point, you're so close, you can taste it. (mysterious music) (announcer speaking Spanish) (guards speaking Spanish) - Worker, take off that beard. - I'm growing it, Jefe. - It is not permitted to grow a beard in here. - Please, Tierno. I'm getting married. And I want to show my gringa that men are macho, huh? (Tierno laughing) And if she doesn't like it... (Tierno laughs) Eh? - A gringa needs someone to teach her a lesson. - Tierno. I'll pay you. 100 pesos a week. Please? (Tierno speaking Spanish) - Just 'til you get married. (cats mewling) - Well, it's a good list, honey. I especially like metal tags, paper passes, perfectly forged. - We'll do it. I'll find a way. - I mean, all this makeup, the lipstick, mascara, all the little stuff, how are you gonna bring that in? - How do you think? - Oh, no. Absolutely not. - Oh, Dwight. - Look, I'd rather scrap the whole damn thing. - Listen to me! - Dwight, Dwight, Olivia's having another one. (cat meowing) - Let me see. Oh, she is, isn't she? How many does she have now? - [Gabrielle] She has four kitties. - Four kitties. Oh, Olivia, what a good cat. You see, she waited 'til you got here, huh? Hey, you. You wearing perfume? Huh? Oh, you little stinker. Look at that. - Oh, she must've grabbed this off my table and brought it in here. Hey! - Yeah? - I mean, she hardly gets searched at all. She charms all the matrons. - And if you did find something on her, you don't know how it got there. - Yeah. Here senora, keep it. - Right. - You know, it could work. It really could work. (Lily knocking) (Dwight speaking Spanish) - [Lily] Stop conjugating and let me in! - Lily! (cat meowing) (Dwight and Barbara laughing) - Playing house? - Senora Levinson, esta su casa. - Hi! - Hello, baby! Gabrielle, what are you doing down on that floor? She's gonna catch a cold. - It's educational. Olivia's having kittens. - Oh! Aw. (kisses) (both laughing) Oh, the beard is gorgeous. What a good idea. - Oh? I don't look good without it? - No, silly, but it'll make them forget the shape of your face. I mean, that is why you decided to grow it, verdad? - I've grown beards before, Lily. What are you- - Please, let us dispense with the cloak and dagger stuff. Aunt Lily knows what you're doing. (cats meowing) You are going to E-S-C-A-P-E. We're gonna bust out of this joint, Louie. Come on. I guessed what you were up to weeks ago. I mean, whose idea was it to begin with anyway? - Lily, we- - Barbara, I know that I tried to talk you out of it, but I've been thinking about it again. Dwight, you can do this. (cats meowing) - I know I can do it. But we're gonna need some help. - (laughs) Now you're talking. We'll make a woman out of you yet, my boy. He'll have to be a gringa. He's much too tall to be a Mexican woman. What we have to worry about are the passes. - Well, we're gonna have them made up in all different sizes and colors. - Stupendo! But not down here. Go up to Brownsville, Texas. It's a repulsive little place, but they have everything up there, and nobody asks any embarrassing questions. - I can describe what I need to them, but I don't think it'll be enough. - Yeah. What we need are actual passes to show them. - She'll have them. My magic basket. - Oh! (both laughing) - Lily Levinson. I sentence you to the hugging machine. Oh! (Lily kissing) Gabrielle. - Don't we all get a hug? (group laughing) (mysterious music) (tense music) (woman speaking Spanish) - Gracias, senora. (man speaking Spanish) - What you bring me today, huh? Bring a present for me? Let me see it. Good, thank you. (speaks Spanish) Mucha gracias, mi nina. - De nada. - Se hablo espanol? Se hablo espanol? That's a smart kid, you got here, lady. Smart kid, eh? - Hi! (upbeat music) (cats meowing) (Barbara chuckling) (adventure music) (Gabrielle giggling) (crowd chattering) - No, no, no, lady, this way. (light adventure music) (woman speaking Spanish) (ominous music) - What's the matter? - This one scares me. - It's going to be just fine. - If they bust the pillow, they'll find everything. - Will you kindly stop it, please? - It's so dangerous! I still think I oughta take it in myself. - You are going to take a bus to Brownsville, Texas. Lupe is going to take the pillow and drop it off at the jail. - But if- - She will leave a false name, and false address. After that, she will get on a bus herself, and go to Veracruz where she will spend a long visit with her family. Believe me, if I thought anything could go wrong, I wouldn't let her do it. She's the best damn cook I ever had. - (sighs) Okay. - Aw, the wedding shirt is gorgeous. You almost done? - Yes. They've changed the date on us again. December 14th. - 14th? Good Lord, that's only three days before. - I know, what could I say? - I think you should postpone the escape. - We can't. We've got it all worked out, the 17th is perfect. We'd have to wait another two months for a day like that. First of all, the third guard is on duty then. - Lame, the halt, and the blind brigade. - Yes, and they're real sloppy. We couldn't dare risk it with the first or second guard shifts. They're much too observant. So there's that, and the fact that on the 17th, Dorm F has a general visit, which means that Dwight could leave Dorm H as a defensor visitor. - And mix with the crowd from F. - Right. - So, you'll get married, and he'll escape. Nobody will expect him to try it then. Everything works to your advantage. - I hope so. (melancholy music) (sewing machine whirring) (gentle music) (guard banging) - [Guard] Dwight Worker. (speaking Spanish) (horn blowing reveille) - Excuse me. (guard banging) - Dwight Worker. (banging) (jazzy Latin music) These belong to you, Worker? Hm? - I guess. - You guess, hm? What do you mean you guess? Mira! It has your name on it. - I'm not expecting it, Jefe, but- - Listen, listen. If it has your name on it, that means that you are responsible for it. Somebody's trying to tell you something. (speaking Spanish) - Jefe. - Ah, your little ruca. She don't like to sleep with her head on a dirty prison pillow. - Si, Jefe. You found me out, huh? - No, no, no. Dinero, you pay me. - Don't even want the damn thing anyway. And now it's gonna cost me. - Mira, mira! Pay me. - You are (speaks Spanish), but you win. - Muy bien. (plastic crinkling) - (sighs) That looks terrible. - (knocking) Worker, open up. - Momento! - Hey, Worker! Come on, mano! Hey! - Geez. - All right, write down everything that's in here. Because it's some good stuff, you know, they gotta pay for it. - Hey, que pasa? - Hey, see this? This is worth at least, what, 50? Right. Worker, I'm gonna have to evict you. I got this cell rented. - To me, and I'm all paid up. - Yeah, but I got someone better. This kid, Calderon, is a Mexicano. His family, they're gonna pay me a lot for a cell. - The Lopez-Calderons are one of the wealthiest families in Mexico. - Hey, this is my cell, man! I've been here for over a year, you just come walking in here and kick me out! - Nothing personal, man! Hey, I got big expenses too, mano! You don't even know what I gotta pay! - Sure, sure, I understand, Jefe. But hey, man, I'm getting married, you know? - Did I say you weren't gonna have a private cell? Did I? Did I ever say that to you? - No, but I like this one! I mean, look, it's all fixed up! (J.W. laughing) - (laughs) He likes the cell! You hear that? He must be digging a tunnel. - And don't we know where. (both laughing) - Gardner, you listen to me. This is my cell, and I don't care how much you're getting, man. Hey, I'll go on a hunger strike, and that story will get in the newspapers. - Hombre. - Then put me back on fahines, I don't care. This is my cell, I paid for it! (Gardner yelling in Spanish) - (laughs) Worker. I'm not your enemy. I like you, mano. You got more courage than all these gabachos put together. - Okay, then look. What I pay is what I get. - (speaking Spanish) You're gonna have it good. You're gonna get a clean new cell, all to yourself. (speaking Spanish) Everything new. (speaking Spanish) Much better for the little girl than a filthy hole like this. - Gardner. What are you talking about? - Ese, I got you transferred. (laughing) No more Lecumberri! You're going to Santa Marta! (tense music) Huh? (Gardner laughing) - Most men have to wait much longer for a place at Santa Marta. Well, you will be notified when all the papers are completed. You must be ready to leave. - Thank you, sir. Do you have any idea when that might be? - I cannot say. It depends on. (speaking Spanish) - I see. It's just that, if they could delay it, put it off a few more weeks. - You want to stay here? At Lecumberri? You, who writes letters to the Embassy about inhuman conditions? Who makes accusations personal against me? - Colonel Fuentes, all I can say is, I was much younger then. You know, I regret all the trouble I've caused. My record has been clean for over a year. - Si, si, but I still do not understand this request to stay in Lecumberri. Why would you do a thing like that? - Well, I'm getting married, sir, and they've put it off so many times that if I'm transferred before then, we'll have to wait again. - I see. - Now of course, Gardner-Pasqual will object to it. - Gardner-Pasqual is not in charge here. I am. - Yes sir, but you see, he said he needs the cell, so he got me transferred. - I make the decision, Worker! No one else. (speaking Spanish) (laughing) You will be transferred when I say so, comprende? - Oh, si. Yes, sir. - Gardner-Pasqual does not like it. Yes, I see. You are to be married on December 17th. - Oh no, sir, I believe that's the 14th. - Has been changed. December 17th, 11:00 in the morning. (dramatic music) - Well, you see, the paperworks, they're perfect. Same color, same print. Met the sweetest little man. He must be the oldest printer in Brownsville. He only charged me 12.50. I wanted to pay him more, but. (both laughing) A defensor and a general. Oh, they're really good. - They'll be even better when you boil them in saltwater and age them down a bit. - Hey. I haven't seen my old man in three long days. (Dwight laughing) - Honey, you better sit down. I got something to tell you. - Is he absolutely certain? - [Barbara] Yes. - I can't believe it. The same day. - The bureaucracy. Gabrielle, hold still. - Well, the blushing bride can still get cold feet. It happens all the time. - Dwight's gone way out on a limb. If we canceled now, they'd really be suspicious. - But I don't see how he's going to have time to get ready. - Well, if they marry us when they say they will, at 11 o'clock, he still will have time to get dressed, makeup, and walk out just after the first bugle at 1:45. - And if they don't? You are farblunget. - Lily, he is going to Santa Marta. We will never have this chance again. - I know, I know, I just never thought there'd be this kind of pressure. (sighs) What does Dwight say? - Go for it. Smaller steps. Point your toes more forward. Keep your arms down, don't swing them. It's a smooth, continuous motion. Lower center of gravity. - I'm not gonna remember all this! - It's not a question of remembering it. It's gotta be second nature to you. You literally have to be a woman. - Barbara. Look, I've been thinking about it, and it isn't gonna work. - Oh, great. - Well, damn it, I'm not gonna fool anybody! They're gonna bust me the minute I leave this cell. - Okay, okay, then let's forget it. - Honey, I'm sorry. It's just, I don't believe in it. - Well then, God knows neither will they. - Okay. (Dwight sighing) - Walk, and don't forget where you're walking to. - The taco stand. - [Barbara] It's right outside the main gate. It's where they make all the women visitors leave their purses. Then after that, you cross the square, take a left at the first street, and that's where I'll be parked. I bought you a bus ticket today to Morelia. Lily's artist friend will put you up 'til it's safe to travel north. - [Dwight] How will I ever, ever thank that lady? - [Barbara] She says to buy her a drink in New York City. She's leaving next week on an extended vacation. What about Jaime? Have you told him yet? - Check. - [Dwight] No, and I'm not going to. - [Barbara] But he's your closest friend. - [Dwight] The more people that know, the riskier it gets. Besides, it could be dangerous for him. (Jaime speaking Spanish) - [Barbara] We've been over and over it so many times, down to the last detail. I just don't know what else we can do at this point. (dog barking) (tense music) - Oh, dear God. Please, hear me now. Be with me tomorrow. Be with Barbara. Protect her. And if I've changed, if I deserve it, please, give me a second chance. Please. (dog continues barking) (Dwight groaning) (tweezers clattering) (Tierno knocking) Te quieres? (Tierno speaking Spanish) Jefe! I thought you were off today. - Ah, I'm working for Gonzalez. He's sick. (cats meowing) (speaking Spanish) You owe me 100 pesos. For the beard. (laughing) (Dwight sighing) - (snaps fingers) Damn, Jefe. Thought you'd slipped up today. Wouldn't have to pay. - Well, last time, huh? (cats mewling) Getting married today. - (laughs) Oh, si, si. I forgot. (laughs) (Tierno speaking Spanish) (door banging) - Nombre? - [Barbara] Barbara Chilcoate. (speaking Spanish) Dwight Worker. - [Guard] Dormitorio? (Barbara speaking Spanish) (paper tearing) Nombre? (crowd chattering) (group humming Mendelssohn's "Wedding March") - Okay, quick, give me a piece of paper before I forget. (Barbara sighing) (pen scribbling) (Barbara groaning) Well, it's not quite right, but it's the best that I can do. The slips are yellow today. - Yellow, coming up. - I spoke to the licenciado, and told him I had to catch a plane. He's agreed to marry us first. (cats mewling) - [Dwight] That's good. I hope they come soon. - Yeah. - It's 10 'til 11. - Damn, I can't use this pen! He used a ballpoint. - We'll have to risk it. - We can't, it looks too different. - It's that, or nothing! - Can't you borrow one? - What if they call us? - Okay, sit down, I'll go over your eyebrows. (cats meowing) - Barbara. Tierno will be on the gate today. - Oh no. - Do a good job on my eyebrows. (group chattering in Spanish) - (banging) Dwight Worker. (speaking Spanish) - Here we go. (lighthearted string music) - Congratulations, Barbara. - Thank you. - Buenos suarte, hermano. Vaya con Dios. - Thank you, Jaime. - Are you all right? You don't look so good to me. - We're fine. Really, thank you. (lighthearted string music) (crowd chattering) (Barbara knocking) (horn honking) (Barbara banging on door) - Oh, Enrique, I've been knocking and knocking. You must've been asleep. - I cannot get the car today, senorita. My brother took it. - But Senora Levinson said... Enrique, you promised. - (speaking Spanish) My brother needed the car. (tense music) (adventurous music) (upbeat Latin music) (taxi driver speaking Spanish) (Barbara speaking Spanish) (door creaking) (guard speaking Spanish) (adventurous music) (horns honking) - Hey, Worker! Open up. I got Calderon here. He wants to buy your stuff. - [Dwight] Later. - Oh, man. He's gonna pay for it right now. - [Dwight] I'm with my wife, huh? (speaking Spanish) (adventurous music) (horns honking) (suspenseful music) (tires squealing) (horns honking) (gentle romantic music) (group speaking Spanish) (tense music) - Mira! Jefe! - What? - Why don't you do something about your commandos? - Why, what did they do now? - I don't like writing letters for those animals that work for you. As long as they pay me, but when they come to my cell in the middle of the night, and I have to listen about how their wives are cheating on them? (man laughing) It's not funny, mano! This is your commandos, damn it! Why don't you control them next time? - [Gardner-Pasqual] Okay, that's not your style. (Jaime speaking Spanish) (tense music) (Tierno speaking Spanish) (guards laughing) (light Latin music) (group speaking Spanish) (men kissing) (tense adventurous music) (tense adventure music continues) (dogs barking) - [Barbara] Aqui, senor! (taxi driver speaking Spanish) (Barbara speaking Spanish) (upbeat Latin music) (adventurous Latin music) (crowd chattering) (tense music) (adventurous Latin music) (suspenseful music) - All right, Worker. Open up! Carajo, the bugle was 10 minutes ago! (door creaking) Hey! (suspenseful music) Where the hell did he go? - Senorita. (Barbara speaking Spanish) (tense music) (suspenseful Latin music) (dramatic music) (joyful adventurous music) (hopeful music) (gentle romantic music) (seagulls cawing) (waves crashing) - [Dwight] After this, I want my life. I want you, and me, and Gabrielle together on a beach somewhere, the sky is blue, the sun is hot, and we're free forever. (waves crashing) (seagulls cawing) (gentle piano music) (bright upbeat music) (bright electronic music)
