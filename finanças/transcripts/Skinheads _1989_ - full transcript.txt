(MultiCom Jingle) - You're alright? - What? - Huh, did you remember to shut the gas in the house? - I shut the gas in the house. - And you locked the front door? - I locked the front door. - Good. - And now I'll open the front door. - Want me to help you with the apron? - No, no, the apron's fine. But Bessie, you know what you could do? You should go over, maybe, with someone to stock, there where the cans are. You know, the vegetables... - You think I don't know my business? I've been doing it all these years, I should know what I'm doing. - Okay, I'm sorry. - Well you take it easy. - Alright. - Listen, open the front door, then put my pocketbook under the counter, make sure that it's hidden. - Okay. - Nobody should see it. - Alright, alright, Bessie. - Alright? Alright. (speaking in foreign language) (energetic rock music) - Hi, Mr. Walkman. - Good morning, Willie. Willie, did you see the A's yesterday? - The second when Grand hit that one out. (laughs) Hit a home run. ♫ Used to love another woman ♫ Had to do her in ♫ Didn't look at all like you - Oh, hi Ms. Walkman. - Hi, Willie, how's mama? - Oh, she's fine, thanks. - Oh, that's good. ♫ Don't think you're a slut ♫ Don't love you ♫ So you might as well run ♫ I just love your guts (bell jingles) ♫ Never sleep in peace again ♫ Close your eyes and I step in ♫ Greet you like your deepest fear ♫ Breaking dry ♫ To wash your tears - Can I have some of those pink things, with the cream inside, can I Damon, can I? I love those things, can I, can I have some of these pink things? ♫ I just love your guts - Those snowballs are 79 cents, each. - Oh yeah? Says who? (gasps) (speaking in foreign language) - You look here, you hoodlums, I'm not going to... - Don't point your finger at us, we don't like it. Do we, Damon? - Where were you old man, Auschwitz? Belsen? Dachau, Treblinka, how did you serve the great nation? What was it like? - You Nazi bastard. I lost my father, my mother, my family. Bessie, the same. For what you are saying, God will strike you down. - God. What God? (laughs) - Why don't you leave that old man alone? - Oh lookie here. A little monkey, with a big mouth. - You talk real bad for a bald headed freak. (Willie grunts) (ominous rock music) - Give me the gun. We are your worst nightmares come to life, old man. (Bessie sobs) - I love bashing apes. - No! (sobs) Leave the boy alone. - Cash. - But we just opened up, it's too early. (Bessie sobs) - This it? (Mr. Walkman groans) - I love you, my darling. (sobs) - You did promise me my allowance this week, didn't you? - Alright, alright. There's more in the back, in a box. Only please don't hurt him. - You're right man, you're always right. - [Bessie] Oh, what has happened? (laughs) Oh my darling man. (sobs) Oh no, no, no. (ominous instrumental music) - Damon, Damon, I want some more of them pink cakes, Damon. Can I get some more, can I? - Alright. Hey man, I understand you did some damage to little brother here? You know something, you're nothing but a racist pig, man. You want some of me man, here I am, come and get it. - Why don't you go back to the plantation, sensible. - That's where I last left your mama. - Move and you're dead meat. (gunshots fire) (gunshot fires) (groans) (police sirens wail) - [Frank] Cops, lets get out of here. (police sirens wail) - You get off this time, skinheads, but we'll be back. We're looking for you. - [Damon] Frank, get the gun. (police sirens wail) (dramatic rock music) ♫ Revenge will be mine ♫ Revenge ♫ Be mine ♫ In your tentacles of lies ♫ Your lies ♫ Now ♫ Now you will too (knock on door) (baby cries) - [Damon] Be cool. (baby cries) Come on in. - Welcome my boy, welcome. Good to see you. - Man. I just got fired again. - Sorry baby. - I told you it was a nowhere job, man. - [Frank] Bet it was a nigger, right? - No it wasn't a black guy, I think he was Mexican or something, I don't know. - Same thing happened to my father, 20 years ago. That's why he left us. It's not about intelligence, or sympathy, it is a natural drive. Every one wants their own kind to keep what they have been working for, all their lives. The ultimate solution always comes up when the money runs out. Outsiders take too much. Even your loved ones, until you are a stranger among mongrels. It is better to be violent, and true to your own, then dilute the purity of the stock. All cultures must face this test. Every one is looking for someone to lead. It is wrong to watch the mongrelization of all civilizations. We are the last remnant of white purity. - Yeah. Yeah. You know man, I've been thinking about what you've been saying, you know what you stand for, the white man. You're right, we are getting the short end of the stick. So, can I hang with you guys or what? (laughs) I mean I wanna do something good for a change. (razor buzzes) (energetic rock music) - Clean and mean, baby. - Not good, man, it's not good. After today every gang with a gun is looking to hang our guts out on a line. We're holding hands with a baby chasing punk. - Randy's one of us now, Matthew, show him some respect. - All I'm saying is, we're not gonna be real popular around here, man. - Shouldn't we get out of town for awhile? Go somewhere? You've been promising me we could ditch this dump, baby. - It's dire that you just shut-up. Shut-up. - See you next week, sweetheart. - Think you're making too much out of all this, Martha. - Oh, I've been hearing you complaining about this. - No, I didn't say I was complaining, I just said well don't go depending on me so much. - Oh, I know, I know. Folks our age shouldn't be carrying on like a bunch of teenagers. - Well that's exactly right. - And you're far too set in your ways to go change? - Right again. - Oh, Tommy, sweet Tommy, love conquers all. - Martha, how long we known each other? - 12 years, smack on, a week Thursday. - Well there you go. That ain't long enough to be talking about love. - Go on. (gentle instrumental music) See you next week. - I reckon. - If I'm still waiting around. (shouts) (bells ring) - Hi. - Hi. - [Amy] Got anything good today? - [Martha] Got lots of good things, all homemade, come in. I got up real early this morning, made four fresh cherry pies well good. Oh never mind, come on. Come on, lets get a seat. Oh yeah, home cooking, that's what the sign says. (melodic instrumental music) - You gotta stay. - Let me out here, man. - Sorry about that. - Come on, Gary. - I'm getting hungry, babe. Getting seriously starved. - You guys eat like it's going out of style. I thought you ate when we left Berkley. - Yeah, but that was Berkley, this is now. - Didn't we agree, or not, that we were going straight to Reno, Dave was calling my name. - Yeah right. Like, hey you schmuck, give me your dough. - 15 minutes, okay? We're gonna get out of here. - Oh yeah, and he's a real good guy. - Really? - Oh yeah. Heck you missed him, he just drove off as you came in. - Martha's home cooking. This could be something, chicken fried steak, mashed potatoes, hot corn bread, cherry pie. (muffled conversations) - [Amy] There are boys. - Ladies, ladies, hello. I'm Paul, and this is Jeremiah. - My good friends call me Tiny. And I'd like both of you to be my good friends. (laughs) In fact, maybe after lunch we could go someplace and get... - Hey did you might forget where we were going? Jeremiah? - [Paul] Yeah, I'm watching my clock. - Sandwiches to go, right guys? I'm Jeff Brooks, how you doing? - [Carla] I'm Carla, this is Amy. (overlapping greetings) - So, you girls from around here? - Sacramento. - Sacramento? You rode bikes all the way from Sacramento to here? - Why not, it's all in the thighs? (objects clatter) - Stupid thing. Oh, great, maybe one of you guys can help me with my 300 year old cook stove in there. I mean sometimes she's great, sometimes she conks out. - You guys are not gonna do this. - We're not going anywhere till we eat. - You guys are paying for lunch. - It came apart right there, I don't... - Yeah, I can help you thread this through. - Can you fix it? - I'll try. - Okay, come on. (group cheers) - [Carla] Go for it, go for it! - [Amy] Give him the edge! Down it goes! (group cheers) - Yeah! - Some pie isn't that? - Ma'am, I gotta tell you that's the best cherry pie I've had since I left home. (laughs) - I should've made a couple more, maybe? - Seriously. - Oh you got it fixed? - Well for the time being, but you better get a pro in there, it's an antique. - You alright? - Yeah, I'm fine. - Thank you very much. - [Jeff] Is there a key for the pump? (ominous instrumental music) - [Damon] So how about a little service here, pal? - Oh I don't work here, I'm just getting a little gas. - Don't tell me. A college boy from Berkley. - Uh-huh. Are you guys from the city or what? - [Damon] Randy, get his wallet. Take his watch. Walt. - Gee, I'm hungry. - Say Jerry, what do you think a couple of nice looking white girls are doing with mongrels like this? - What was that? - Cool it man, it ain't worth it. - I don't know Damon. Maybe they're a couple of Jewish princesses. (laughs) - Why don't you take your racism and get the hell out of here? - How refreshing, a woman with courage. - Listen... - Why don't you take that neo-Nazi double talk, crawl into a bunker, and die like that coward, Hitler. - Better yet, nigger, why don't you drop to your knees and beg for mercy, before I split you open like a pig? - Yeah, stick him Frank. - Okie-doke, here we go. Okay now, look, I don't know what's going on boys, but I don't want no trouble here. - Well maybe you should be more careful about who you let in. - We love the smell of pine, and the sound of the stream. - Stop it. - And we love to watch raccoons steal garbage. So we come in here, dressed as we are, and we get insulted by this gentleman, and when we get insulted we get angry. And when we get angry we have to do something about it. - You wanna play with me, hey that's fine. Only lets do it out back, because there's no use in messing up this fine lady's place. - Well you're absolutely right. After you Senor Black. - Look you tell your boyfriend, Kojak here, to put the knife away. - Why don't you tell me, big mouth? - Put it away. (laughs) - He's right, no knives. This is a job for Brains. We'll settles this like white men. (ominous instrumental music) - Yo, I wish I could have another one of them sweet rolls, Damon, you know with the cherries inside. - Lets go, lets go, just take 'em, you can have all you wanna eat. - Move it ladies. Move it! (overlapping shouting) - Come on Brains, put him out. Come on with it man. (group laughs) (glass shatters) - Hey, hey, wait a minute now, wait a minute. Look I don't allow no fighting around here. - Listen lady, we'll settle this man to gorilla, and once we're finished we'll leave in peace. Lets go Brains, get him. - Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee. Got a skinhead in one, two, three. - [Amy] Yeah. - This guy's strong, Damon. - Come on Brains, you've taken on bigger, and blacker than this before. - Smash his face, Brains. - Come on Brains, come on. - Come on Brains, come on, yeah! - Ah, come on, he's big and he's dumb, you can drop this guy no problem, get him. - [Damon] Come on! Turn around. - Come on Brains, just hit him. Come on, that's it, come on. Come on Brains! Hit him! - Come on! - Come on Brains, come on, turn around! - Come on Brains! - Get over there! (Brains groans) - Get up man! Come on Brains, man, come on! - Come on Brains! Come on Brains! (screams) Yeah! - Squeeze him, squeeze him. - Oh. (groans) (laughs) - That's wrong Damon, that's wrong. (laughs) (Brains groans) (gunshot fires) (Tiny groans) - You son of a... (shouts) - Get out there. Stay there. - Rot in hell. (groans) - See what happens to guys with big mouths? Yeah, they get a pain in the side. (laughs) - What'd you do that for, Damon? - Because it's wrong that men kiss men, Brains. The first sign of the decline of any great civilization is the acceptance of homosexuality. - Yeah, but why'd you shoot him? I could've took him, Damon. - What are you guys crazy, man? Now what the hell are we gonna do? - You pussies are always talking about getting rid of the scum that is de-purifying the white race. Well I just did something about it. White power. - Yeah, white power! Yeah! - But it does bring up an interesting question, doesn't it? What are we gonna do about the girls? (groans) - Come on baby! Come on. (overlapping shouting) (girls scream) - [Carla] No! - Yeah! - Leave her alone! - Come on here, yeah! (dramatic rock music) - It's time it's turning into a party. - What's going on? - Ladies and gentlemen may I have your attention please? (overlapping shouting) (Carla sobs) - Please. Please, help me. Please. - I'm sorry. (Carla screams) - [Frank] Yeah! Yeah! (Carla screams) - [Carla] Please, help me! (ominous instrumental music) (Carla screams) - Come on. Shit. (Carla sobs) (Skinheads laugh) (screams) - No! No! (screams) (dial tone blares) (phone rings) (bones crack) - No! - Shit! (dial tone blares) - Carla? Oh, Carla. - Come on, answer the phone. - She's dead. You Nazi son of a bitch! - Brains never did know his own strength. - Come on, you wanna rape me? Go ahead. Or do you neo-Nazis always let the big idiot do your dirty work? I bet you can't even get it up. (ominous instrumental music) - Lets get him, get him! Come on, come on! Come on, come on, come on! - Run Amy! (groans) (engine rumbles) (tires squeal) (gunshots fire) - [Jeff] Amy! Come on, get in. (gunshots fire) (overlapping shouting) (engine rumbles) - Here, here we go, here we go, here we go. Ah, here we go! (shouts) (dramatic rock music) - [Amy] They're right behind us, faster! - It's floored already. (gunshots fire) (gun clicks) (tires squeal) - Come on. - [Liz] Come on Frank, come on, Frank! (gunshots fire) - Come on, hurry, come on. - I'm trying, can't do anymore. (tires squeal) - Where the hell did they go, shit! - [Amy] Are you alright? - [Jeff] Fine, go ahead. Go ahead, you go on out. (engine rumbles) - Shit, damn it to hell, we had 'em, we damn near had 'em. - Which way, Frank? - I don't know, Walter, Fritz. - Here, up there! - What's the matter with you guys, don't you understand they're witnesses? - Use your head, come on, we gotta get 'em. - They can identify every one of us. - I think we should stay here, Damon. - There's another road a couple of miles away, they hitch a ride, I don't wanna take that chance, do you? - He's right man, come on, lets double the cliff right now, before it's too late, before they get away. - Either you're with us, or you're against us, Jerry. - I'm with you, all the way, Damon. Come on Walt, come on. - Alright, lets go, lets go. - [Frank] Come on! (gentle instrumental music) - Damn it, there's not much here. - You don't got any knives or anything in there, do you? (ominous instrumental music) - Hey listen, man. We lost 'em. God damn, we're on a goose chase. - They have to be up there, we keep going, okay? - What the hell for? - 'Cause of this. - Lets go. (ominous instrumental music) (inhales deeply) (laughs) - I guess I realize it sounds kind of stupid, but do you happen to have any idea where we're going? - Yeah, away from them. - Good, never would have thought of that. (ominous rock music) - [Jeff] What are you doing when you're not getting chased by Nazis? - I work for Congressman Ramirez. - [Jeff] Oh yeah, what do you do for him? - Oh, he's got me working on the urban renewal project. Along with developing contacts in the private sectors for fundraising. - Yeah? - Yeah. - I heard of him. I think he came to speak at Berkley last semester. - I know. What'd you think? - Well I did not personally hear him, I don't really care about politics. - Well that's a great attitude. You know apathy is the weakness of our country. You don't give a damn about anybody but yourself, huh? - Yeah, I guess you're right. Wasn't this thing full an hour ago, or what? (ominous rock music) - I'm sorry. I think I've gotten us lost. - Is this safe to drink? - [Amy] It might be. - Should I drink it? - I don't know, it depends how thirsty you are. - How thirsty I am, right. - [Amy] Course, I wouldn't take too much. - Thanks. - We'd better keep going. (ominous rock music) (groans) - Damon, we're gonna get killed out here, if we keep going at night, man. - They ain't getting nowhere either. Can't we stop? - Alright, alright, alright, stop bitching. Frank, make a fire. Randy, go help him. - [Frank] Come on Randy. - You hungry? - What do you got? Man, I've never seen that before. But it's gotta be healthy, right? - If you don't like it you don't have to eat it. - No, no. You got any salt? - This looks like a good place to set up camp. - You sure. - Yeah, looks safe. - Okay. - This green wood ain't no good, it ain't gonna burn, find some leaves, dry leaves. Go on! (Brains coughs) - Damon, I'm hungry. Can't we eat? - Good idea. Why don't we phone out for some pizza? (laughs) - Oh, that ain't funny, Damon. Besides, I gotta go to the bathroom. - Oh Jesus, Brains. You're gonna stink the place up. Go in the bushes, will ya? - Okay, only what do I use to... - [Frank] Use a leaf, you big dummy. - Oh yeah, good idea, Frank. - Look, I'm real sorry, but this bag is only made for one person. - Oh. Oh. Okay. Well... Sleep well. I'm gonna make a fire. - Oh, that's a great idea. Then those punks will find us, and slit our throats while we're sleeping. - It gets pretty cold out here at night, huh? - You'll survive, just fine. - [Jeff] Oh don't worry, I'll be fine. - I won't, goodnight. - Goodnight. So you're a real outdoorsman, huh? - Woman. - Sorry. Is that true, what they say? I think I read it somewhere that when you fall asleep outside at night, and it's really cold, that sometimes you really actually freeze to death, and die. - Look, Jeff, you're not gonna freeze to death, and die. - You sure about that? - Get in. - Thank you. Okay, just a second. Alright. Gonna do one foot at a time. - You're gonna have to do sideways or something. - Okay. - There we go. - And the other foot down. - Yeah. You got the zipper? - Wait I'm caught on something here. Okay. You alright? - Yeah, I'm fine. - You think this is funny? (laughs) - Oh, alright. Okay. (sighs) (gentle instrumental music) You know, I never got a chance to thank you for coming and getting me at the cafe. - [Jeff] What was I gonna do, leave you there? - You could have. - Yeah, well. - I'd be like Carla right now. I'm real sorry about your friends. - Yeah, well... Goodnight. - Goodnight. - It's fun being outdoors like this. I kind of like it. I used the leave like you said, Frank, only it kind of itches. (gentle instrumental music) (growls) (suspenseful instrumental music) (shouts) - Get out of here, shoo, ha! Ha, get out of here, shoo, ha! - Hey, what's the matter, listen, I move around in my sleep... (stammers) It wasn't intentional, whatever I did. - Go back to sleep. - Oh my God. - It's them against us. You do understand, don't you Randy? - Did you have to kill those guys? - Yes, I did. We are soldiers in a revolution. In war the strong survive, and the weak die. It's them against us, Randy. Lets go, get up. Lets go, everybody up. Lets go, lets get a move on. - My back hurts. - Tell me about it, I feel like I've been thorough a meat grinder. - My butt itches, Frank. - What else is new, dummy? - This is crazy, Damon, we're never gonna find them in this wilderness. - Yeah, you got that right. - Why don't we just get the hell back to the death van, and head for the state line? - Because I say we don't. - But Damon, this is crazy, we're just getting more... - You people are gonna kill me, you know? What the hell do you think is going on here anyways? You know the Aryan revolution is coming. You wanna be sitting behind bars with a bunch of niggers, and spicks when we get the call? You can go ahead and watch from San Quentin, but I'm gonna be out there, bashing skulls. Those two, mongrels, out there can finger every one of us for murder one. I'm not going to suck up a lung full of cyanide, because you pussies can't handle a little guerrilla combat. - Yeah, tell 'em man. - So who's with me? - You can count on me, Damon, you can always count on me. - We talked about this once, and we're not going to talk about it again. - Alright. Lets just get it the hell over with. - Okay, we'll all spread out, we can cover more ground that way. If you find anything, you scream your guts out. Alright? Lets go! Get up. (ominous instrumental music) (gargles water) - Damon, something's wrong! - You poor idiot, you wiped yourself with poison ivy. - That's bad, ain't it? (ominous instrumental music) - Jeff! Jeff! (dramatic rock music) Jeff! - [Frank] Come on, come on, they're over here, over here. Come on, come on! - [Amy] Jeff! - [Jeff] Bastard! How does it feel, how does it feel? You son of a bitch! God damn you! Son of a bitch. - Jeff. Jeff! - What? - Look at what you're doing. (gunshots fire) (gunshots fire) - Come on, come on lets get out of here. (dramatic rock music) (gunshots fire) (gunshot fires) - [Frank] They're not here! - Where are you? - [Frank] They must be here somewhere. - Damon, I'm thirsty. I gotta have some water. - Go on. - [Frank] Damon, we'd better keep going. Damon, lets keep going. - [Brains] My butt itches. - [Frank] Damon, come on, lets go. - [Damon] Shut up, Frank. - [Frank] Come on Damon, lets go. Damon! - How you doing, you feel better now? - I'm fine. Just a little shook up. - Figured out where we are yet? - I don't have any idea. Maybe we can get some help over there. - Where? - Look! - Golly. Hello, anybody home? - Hello? Let me take a look at that. My dad used to take me skeet shooting. Looks like a 12 gauge Stevens. Scatter gun. - Oh they've got water in here. - [Amy] Oh, great. Oh great. - [Jeff] Oh man, look at this. - Oh my God. Are you sure this is okay? (ominous instrumental music) (door hinge creaks) (gasps) - My fingers got a kind of a twitch to it. - Just relax okay, we can explain. - I'm listening. - There's a group of guys that are after us, and they've already killed our friends. - We took a little food, I'll be glad to pay you for it. - Put your money away. Somebody's hungry in these parts, he's welcome to my hospitality. Usually I do my own inviting. Now lets settle down, and tell me what happened. Who's after you? - [Jeff] THey're neo-Nazis, Skinheads, they think they're gonna do it again. Hitler's like a god to them, they're crazy. - The Nazis, I never would've believed it. They harm my Martha, they gotta answer to me. Nazis. I still can't believe it. (dramatic rock music) - Is there another way out? - No. Hang on. (gunshots fire) (gunshots fire) (gunshots fire) - [Frank] I'll go this way, come on. I'm going this way. - Give me that gun. - How many more shells you got? - Plenty. - Great. - Back at the cabin. (Frank shouts) - Drop the gun, old man, or this bitch is dead! - I don't give a damn about her. I'll scatter the both of you. - Yeah? - Alright. Say your prayers, boy. - No! (Frank shouts) No, no, no! - They're as dumb as they look, aren't they? Come in. Now there's one, hurry up! (gunshots fire) Shut the damn door! (gunshots fire) (glass shatters) (ominous instrumental music) (gunshot fires) Nazis. I never would've believed it. Where did that bastard run? Just like in Normandy, when we had them on the run there, too. (gunshot fires) Nazis never were much for fighting except for stomping on defenseless people. And running away. Go on, get the hell out of here. Go back to your little... (labored breathing) - Hold him back there. He's lost a lot of blood. - We've gotta do something for this kid... - I know. Get him some water, and a rag. Hurry! - Lets catch 'em off their guard, lets rush 'em. - Go ahead, you'll be picking buckshot out of your teeth. I'd love to see that. - Yeah, well listening to you is what got us into this mess in the first place. (crickets chirp) - Four, five, six. - [Amy] How you feeling, Mr. Huston? - One Nazi slug won't keep me down for long. - You're still bleeding pretty bad. - I shouldn't have brought you kids here. You're like rats in a trap. - [Amy] If it weren't for you we'd be dead by now. - Yeah take these, okay thanks. (winces) - I can't see a goddamn thing. (gunshot fires) - Frank, give me your knife. - Let me... - Forget it, baby. (ominous instrumental music) (laughs) - Listen man, lets just get the hell out of here. While we're still in one piece. - It's your fault this happened to me, man. I wouldn't have gotten shot if you hadn't opened your mouth. - Hey, I couldn't see where I was going, man. - He's right, man. It's too damn dark out there. - Alright, we leave at first light. - I bet they got food in there. (ominous instrumental music) (chains clatter) - You gonna blow us up, boy? - You remember the imagine-a-line, don't you Mr. Huston? - I remember what happened to it. - Not this time. (chains clatter) - Are you really gonna use that thing? - Why not? People are more like animals than that goddamn bear. Push that up here. - They killed Tiny, because of his skin. And the others for kicks. Even though Tiny was one of the best guys I ever knew. Everybody that knew him loved him. And that scum killed him, just 'cause he was black. I've been floating around for years pretending like this stuff didn't exist anymore. I can't pretend anymore. And I can't walk away. No more apathy. Tough way to learn a lesson. - How bout making breakfast for all of us? ♫ Our pal Jerry ♫ Our pal Jerry ♫ Our pal Jerry ♫ Has screwed up one more time - I thought we all agreed to share, and share alike, Jerry? - [Brains] I want some of that beef jerky. - I stole it. It belongs to me. - You know there must be unity if the white race is going to survive, and be pure. You know that, don't you Jerry? Unity and discipline. Hitler never would've lost the war, if it hadn't been for his generals. His generals betrayed him. Hitler was strong, his followers weak. Mein fuhrer was right, do you doubt that Jerry? - You think you're as great a leader as Hitler, man, but you're nothing without that gun. You're nothing man, a big nothing. - Maybe you should be the next leader. The next man to take the white race to their rightful place to world domination. (gun cocks) Do you think you can handle that Jerry? - I didn't say that. - What are you saying? - Nothing, nothing. (energetic rock music) - [Frank] No, let 'em fight. If Damon can't take him, maybe Jerry's right. - No Damon can take him, you can count on that. Come on Damon. Come on, come on. (overlapping shouting) (dramatic rock music) ♫ You want a purse with diamonds ♫ And then you want everything ♫ You want a house in Vegas ♫ That just fucking stinks ♫ You wrecked your car ♫ I dare you - Okay man, okay. Damon, alright, that's enough. - Serves you right, Jerry. (coughs) - He had a bad night. - Well his day's gonna be worse. - Brains, go with Frank. - Come on. - You don't stand a chance! All we want are the mon... (gunshot fires) (gunshot fires) - Let me have that, son. The scatter gun is the best at far away. You can't go shooting at everything that moves. Let me have those. (labored breathing) Two good ones left. Lets make 'em count. - I can handle that 12 gauge pretty good, you know. - I'll bet you can, honey. But I'll play this hand alone. (dramatic instrumental music) (gunshot fires) (groans) One less Nazi in the world. - Liz! (gunshots fire) (gunshots fire) (gunshots fire) (glass shatters) - [Jeff] Mr. Huston, what are you... - You're not the only one who can set a trap, son. Get back. - They must be out of shots. - You can't be sure, man. - Well there's only one way to find out. - Damon. - Damon, no, no, no, no! No, please don't shoot, don't shoot, no, please. Please, no! No! - Alright that's it. - Brains. After you. Hi honey, I'm home. What are you pointing that thing at me for, old man? What are you gonna say, bang bang, you're dead? - I've got two shells in here. And I ain't afraid to die. - Oh is that right, well you are going to get your wish. What are you protecting them for, don't you know what they are? - Sure I know. They're Americans. - Americans? Those are the kind of people that are destroying America. Did you know that this bitch, and her friend are nigger lovers, dad? We caught them consorting with a real live schvartsa. - That bullshit's why we flushed your kind before. - I don't think you're really listening to me. You know, I don't understand you, old man. You're a white man, and you don't look like a Jew. Do you mind? I've always loved a good cigar. (ominous instrumental music) Don't you see what's going on in this country? - I can see there's always some crazy new hate preaching bastard in the world, that's gotta be stamped out. - Pops, Pops, Pops! You're just not getting the point here, are you? Have you ever heard of the ZOG? ZOG. Zionist Occupational Government. They're the ones that are running this country. They are taking over the world through the marketplace, bankers, industrialists, multinational corporations are controlling world policy, and economies. Do you think you're getting the truth on the six o'clock news? We don't even own America anymore. We are on the verge of extinction. Outsiders are buying our lands, our homes, our businesses, our country. I can't even find a white man to fix my car! Only the Fuhrer was telling the truth. And he was the most misunderstood man in history. What people have to understand is that what the Fuhrer was trying to do was to make the world safe, for people like you and me. Good people. White people. - Your little shiggle proo was a maniac. - Don't you ever call him that, alright? His name is Adolf Hitler, and it's the man I love, dad. - He was a sick man, and you people are his cancer. - What do you really know about it, college boy? - I'll handle him right now, here hold this. I'm gonna dragon that little bitch. - You ran away from us before, but now we're going to show you what the master race is all about. - One more step, boy, and you'll be a lot closer to your little paper hanger than you wanna be. - Well I say you're out of shells old man, I heard the hammer click empty. - Taking a big gamble, Adolf. - Maybe, Pops, maybe. - I could be running a bluff. - Damon, wait, don't you think this has gone far enough? - You disappoint me boy. (gunshots fire) (gunshot fires) - [Jeff] No! (gunshot fires) Mr. Huston! (groans) (fire explodes) Come on Amy, come on. (trap clatters) (Jerry shrieks) (dramatic rock music) (gunshots fire) - [Jerry] Get it out man, get it out! - That coward has screwed up for the last time. I'm gonna kill him. - [Jerry] Get it out, get it out man. My leg. Oh my god, it's killing me. - You screwed up again Jerry, you screwed up again. - Get it out. Get it out man, get it out. - Jerry, it's your responsibility. They got away when we were holding the gun. - What do you mean, man? Hey, everybody got blinded when that thing went off, man. Hey, you can't blame me. You said that the old guy was out of bullets. You said it! (groans) I couldn't see nothing. Come on man. - I need a drink. - I couldn't see nothing, man! I tried to shoot them once, I tried. - We're gonna take you outside, Judas, and nail you to the wall. - Stop. - I'm sorry, no. (ominous rock music) (Jerry shrieks) - No! Don't leave me, I'm sorry, I didn't mean. Don't do this, please, please. - Come on, Liz, lets go. - Don't leave me, don't leave me here. Please god, please, please. Don't leave me, I didn't mean it! I didn't mean it, please. (groans) - What is it? - My ankle. - That's it, that's it. No more running. I'm going back. - No, lets keep going. - Come over here, come here, come here, come here. Sit down, sit down. Listen to me, I want you to get up in that tree, and hide yourself, don't move a muscle. I'm going back for them. - No, don't. - [Jeff] It doesn't matter anymore. - They'll kill you. - Tiny, and Paul never knew what hit 'em. Carla never had a chance. The old man just went to the wall and died for us, we were strangers to him. I can't run, I gotta live with myself. - No, lets just stay together, we can keep going. - You cannot make it, sweetheart. Get up here. Hide here, and don't move a muscle. I'll find you. - Ow. - Brains, Brains, go this way. - Damon, I don't want to, please. - Go on, Brains. Frank. She asked you to. - I need a drink. - The great betrayal, Frank? - No. - It's a matter of honor, Frank. (sobs) You want those mongrels to win? - No. (sobs) - You owe me Frank. - Alright. (dramatic instrumental music) - Jesus, Brains, I almost shot you. Maybe I should. I told you to stay with Frank. - I wanna stay with you guys. Can I Damon, please, can I? - Alright. Just stay out of the way. (ominous instrumental music) (sobs) - Get away, no, no. (sobs) No, get away from me! No, no! Get away, no, no! No! Get away! (shrieks) (bear growls) No! No! (sobs) (ominous instrumental music) (groans) (gun clatters) (shouts) (bones crack) (dramatic instrumental music) - He don't look too good, Damon. - Course not, you idiot, he's dead. I am going to kill the hero with my bare hands... - Damon, there's a rifle, over here. - Jesus, God. We are going to split up to find the hero and the woman, you understand? - Please don't leave me alone, Damon, I'm scared all by myself, please, please don't leave me alone. - Goddamn it Brains, grow up will ya? You wanna spend the rest of your life in jail? - No. - Then stay away from trees and the brush so you can see in all directions, okay? Okay? If you see or hear anything, anything at all, you yell as loud as you can, okay? - If I see or hear anything at all, I yell. I got it Damon. - Okay, I'll come find you when I've finished my job, okay? Go. - If I see or hear anything at all, I yell. (dramatic instrumental music) I don't like this. I don't like this. If I see anything, I yell. I don't like this, Damon. Mommy. I'm lost. I'm lost, I don't like this. What's that? If I see anything, I hear anything, I yell. I don't like this, I don't like these trees. I gotta get out of here. I don't like this. (snake hisses) I'm lost. - Now's our chance to just get out of here, we can go back to the road and steal a car. Maybe we can go south of the border, or something. - I want that hero. - What you want is his old lady. That's what all this is about, right Damon? - You're awfully smart. Maybe too smart for your own good. I will do whatever I want with that bitch, once I find her. Do you understand me? I asked you a question, bitch. Do I do what I want to when I find her, or not? - Right. - Right what? - You can do what you want with her. - [Damon] Better. (dramatic rock music) - If I hear anything, I yell. I don't like this. Where am I? Damon? What's that? I don't like these big trees. Damon? I'm lost. (snake hisses) I don't like this. It's scary. Damon? Mommy? (snake hisses) It's scary. Damon? Mommy? What's that noise? (Brains sobs) I don't like this. - [Amy] No! - Romeo couldn't make it, he sends his regrets. - [Amy] No, let me go! Jeff! Jeff! - She makes another sound, you waste her. Understand? Now, let me teach you. - I'm scared. (sobs) (snake hisses) - Hey, Einstein. (shouts) I got a present for you. (Brains shouts) (chokes) - Damon. Oh, mommy. (Brains coughs) - Now let me teach you to fulfill the sacred duty of the 1,000 year Reich. Look at me. Look at me, I want you to look at me. Fulfill the noble destiny of the master race. Look at me, join with me, be with me, Amy. At the lonely heights of power, be with me, be with me. I'm going to go find the hero, you give me the gun. (breathes heavily) (ominous instrumental music) - Get up, it's time for girl talk. - You saw what he did. You just stood there and watched. - Shut-up. Shut-up. - He's crazy, can't you see that? - I said shut-up. You loved every minute of it. Oh yeah. I was watching your eyes, you forget I know what it's like with Damon, I know what he can do, and it's only for me. See, he's gonna be the father of a new race. It has to be very pure. He told me so. (laughs) Let me show you something. Nobody else has ever seen it before, except for Damon, 'cause I let him do it to me. Now you know why you have to die. The new master race is coming from me, and Damon, and nobody can stop that. Nobody. - Jeff. (groans) (Liz coughs) - Damon! (coughs) - What happened, Liz, did she get away? - I'm scared, baby. Did you enjoy it with her? - She's just another pony, baby. - But did you like it, tell me. - Besides they're dead meat anyways. You know you're not gonna make it, baby. We must be strong, or else we disappear. The Fuhrer knew that when he went into the bunker. He knew the end of the Third Reich was coming, but that soon, one day, others would create the Fourth Reich. He knew his duty was to history. (ominous instrumental music) You are a distraction, not an ally. - I love you. (gunshot fires) (gunshot fires) - Jeff! Jeff! Jeff! - Amy? (screams) - No, let go of me. - Look at me, look at me, look at me, it's alright, it's alright. - Don't touch me. - It's okay. - They're all dead, did you see the other guys? - I didn't mean to do it. I didn't mean to do it. - What's the matter, it's alright, it's alright. Are they gone? Huh? Okay, relax, we're alright now, come on. Lets get out of here, lets get out of here, lets go. Easy. It's okay. Amy. Civilization. Come on. Easy. - Oh my God. (gentle instrumental music) Oh. (laughs) - Look. - Oh, alright. (laughs) We're gonna be okay. - Hey. - A car. - Hey! - Stop! - Hey, stop! Hello? - [Amy] Hello? - [Jeff] Stop! Hey, can you please just stop? What does he think I'm doing, playing? - Oh wait, here comes another one. - Okay, hang on, I'm gonna get this one. - Hey! Hey, hey! Hey, hey! Hey, hey, man! ♫ I brought you hell ♫ I brought you hell ♫ I brought you hell - [Jeff] Amy, jump! (tires squeal) (dramatic rock music) (Damon shouts) (Amy shouts) (Damon screams) (coughs) (ominous instrumental music) (breathes heavily) - [Amy] Wait, what if he's still got the gun? - Fine. Come on. Come on, you son of a bitch. You piece of shit, you're gonna die. - I keep telling you college boy, we are the master race. - You're not getting out of this alive, no one's that stupid, or that blind, they'll let it happen again. Never again. - Come on. - Never again. Come to me. You piece of shit, come on! (dramatic rock music) (gunshots fire) (gun chamber clicks) - We will never die. - It's okay, it's alright, it's over. It's over. - We will never die.
