Christians, all come here to listen a real speech And hear my ballad tell Of three inhuman monsters Who lived in bygone times They murdered passers-by in truly heinous crimes In the Ard?che, at Peyrebeille in the Vivarais They set up their trade on a lonely highway On this road stood the Red Inn The secret den of bloody sin These monsters had a daughter, apple of their eye But she had no lover, though her charms ran high Few inns in France, whether of repute or wild Can boast a maid as chaste as the Martin child There were so many victims that they remain beyond count At a hundred and thirty-three some put the amount But a thousand might well be closer to the mark Tremble, one and all, to hear of crimes so dark Neighbours on this tranquil mountain scene Held Martin and his wife in high esteem Morally they rated a clean bill of health For esteem often follows in the wake of wealth An organ-grinder tramping the way One snowy night, all unaware Came to the inn with his monkey And fell victim to the snare Finish it off, too! Let him go, he won't talk How do you know these brutes don't talk? Just a minute... Shoot it! No gunfire, do it with a knife -That does it! -No, leave it to me I thought it was the organ-grinder! The monkey will think so, too. Go and hide When we share out, can I have the organ? I didn't steal it -Beastly Blackamoor! -It wasn't me, it was her I don't care! Give me that... now just you wait! Well, now... hunters Jugged hare is very good Or even a bacon omelette I was talking to you about serious matters. Aren't you hungry? Yes. Is it far to the monastery? We won't be there before midnight Oh, f... for the love of God, my staff! I can feel a terrible draught between my legs Where am I? Oh, Father... an abyss It's the bridge, then It's the bridge, we're not far from the inn -What inn, Father? -A nice inn, boy You've been there? Never inside, but it's renowned Now that I come to think of it... ...I wonder if God placed it in our path For God sees all, and He must know that we can go no further Suppose it should be a nice haunch of boar... ...cooked in red wine with a nice chestnut sauce? Will we be there soon? No, there's at least four hours to go yet There's still time for us to be attacked a hundred times Oh my God, what am I doing here among all the highwaymen? If your so afraid, you shouldn't gad about flaunting your diamonds I'm not gadding about! I've attended a dearly loved sister's funeral And this is all I have left of her Poor little Adelaide It's easy to be brave if you've nothing to loose I'd be happy to have what she has to loose! It would hardly make you wealthy, sir Mittens for mother, a snuff-box for father, a spelling-book for our servant I'm teaching him to read. He's a black A black! But they're savages... Aren't you afraid? No, ours is very gentle, very sweet The monkey... look! Help! Your axe! -What about my axe? -Highwaymen! So what? I haven't any money. so they won't do anything to me He'll let us all be murdered, just because he has no money Protect me, sir! Well? What is it? A vision from hell, with plumes and a long tail It bit my nose and took to the skies. Result: the shaft's broken We are doomed! Keep you seats. There's an inn where we can mend it -It's quite near -Could we sleep there? What do you think, sir? Alas, a painful duty urges me on my way My poor father is at death's door This inn will probably be cawling with vermin, anyway There are no vermin at our establishment, Madame If Mathilde were here, it wouldn't have happened I don't like her being away, either The three of us are like children when she isn't here What's the use of complaining? There's work to be done Is that all? -It wasn't worth the bother -He said he'd done well Never believe a strolling player -You know I don't smoke -Stop grumbling all the time I've got too many knives already Don't take it, then -What's this? -Tarot cards God almighty! It's Death! He's dead isn't he? The cards never lie But I turned it up, not him Pick another one and you'll have better luck The Monkey! I knew it, that monkey's going to be the end of us Burn all this The organ, too Not the music, Madame promised. I'm bored. I need some amusement here All right, take it. You can have it Don't worry, I'll get it back later Someone's knocking Mathilde! We didn't expect you until tomorrow I was dying to get home -You're not alone? -No, I've brought other travellers What a darling child! This is really too much, my dear We were lamenting our luck, too Well, you should never say die -Are they armed? -No, just an axe -Shall we finish our game? -Certainly There's time before dinner, and I'm always ready to oblige Mulled wine for everyone, Madame What a lovely fire But what a strange smell it has We were just burning some old cloths How sensible; one gets so attached to old things Did you know our coach was attacked? You weren't robbed, I hope No, thank God, or they'd have taken this I'm sure you've never seen one like it They don't grow on trees hereabouts -Will you help me? -With pleasure, Madame What now? Our shaft's broken; can you lend us one? A shaft? I couldn't really say I'll have to look in the barn Please God, let him find a shaft! We'll do this job and then retire to the country -What are you looking at? -The big one with the axe But look at the necklace. My pigeon, I shalll give it to you It will suit you well You really shouldn't, darling Don't worry about the man with the axe, he won't be around long Your mistake was not taking my six I did think of it, but too late Have you any money? No, only my axe So I saw I could pay you in work We don't need anybody, we do everything ourselves. Drink up and go Get going! -Do I really have to go? -Right now I can't set off in the dark Now he's the one that's afraid of highwaymen! They won't harm you, you have no money! You were talking big in the coach. Now it's our turn! -In the hayloft, perhaps? -There's no room -I'll curl up small -You'd still be too big You've nothing to worry about. You're too big for thieves to attack Much too strong... you're lucky, you are Being strong comes in handy sometimes. Goodbye, off you go What about the shaft? No shaft... we haven't any shaft We've looked everywhere, haven't we, Marie? No shaft The ones we have are no use, you'd just have an accident Then we must spend the night here And you'll sleep the sleep of the dead How nice, I love this house Better to miss a business appointment than risk dying -I'm a widower, so I'm in no hurry -My poor father is waiting... He won't mind hanging on one more night Our Christmas ham? Nothing is too good for them; we owe them that much Monsieur, two of them are playing cards One is taking all the other's money What difference does it make? We're going to kill them all Which room are you giving me, child? Our Midas room You have many wealthy travellers? Not as wealthy as you, Madame I hope the bed's nice Oh, well, it will do for one night This room is already occupied, my girl This one is almost as nice Provided my neighbour doesn't snore Rest assured He should be in the garden by now I knew we'd forgotten something -I hope he was sleeping -Like a baby He was an artiste; he doesn't weigh much Where are you going? Not that way! Where should I put him? By the pear tree? No, that's where the pharmacist is True, there's little room left now Hurry! I'm glad this one came along He had a lovely music-box... a box with a handle you turn You don't have to learn music, you just turn the handle If learning to read was as easy... I've brought you a spelling-book You needn't have bothered I'm going to make music all the time now Where is he? We'll loose him if you leave him lying The ground's too hard to dig What are we going to do? Wait, do what I tell you We're saved, Janou! Do you see the light? I was afraid they'd be in bed The downstairs windows are lit, which means they're still at table We're going to sit down with them and join in the conversation Should they prove to be rowdy company, with drunks or loose women there... ...well, in that case... We'll leave You're joking! We'll eat in our room, that's all Will they welcome us without money? You don't know how kind-hearted the local people are, Janou Did you hurt yourself, Father? It would never enter their minds to make a poor monk pay They know God will reward them by blessing their endeavours A pretty child making a snowman With a negro... all black against the white snow Isn't he handsome? I should say so And you are a very pretty young lady I shall imagine my guardian angel as looking like you May I? You may, too Can I? It looks as if you can, all right That's enough for a novice That's got this fellow laughing; I must kiss him, too Your snowman isn't finished, he lacks a nose -Don't touch it! -I'm only making him a nose He hasn't a pipe I've got his pipe Your poor snowman hasn't a hat, either Now that's a real snowman for you A bit fat; you can tell he ate at a good inn Now let us pray he won't melt tonight It's getting milder Lead the way, F?tiche -What's a novice? -I am Very nice, too. And what does it do Becomes a monk Like him? Not right away; it takes time to become a monk You have to learn Latin, Greek, even Hebrew The Old and New Testaments, and all the prayers Is your heart broken? Why not wait until it is before becoming a monk? You have to have a girl to break your heart A girl is less hard to master than Latin I don't know... I don't know Latin, or girls, either Look, he's lost his pipe Well, Latin is something I can't teach you You mustn't catch cold, Father Some mulled wine for the reverend Father What time is it? Have you dined already? No, don't worry, Father I saw you playing cards, you see I'm sure your feet are soaked, Father. Take off your shoes Is it all right, do you think? What pretty silks! Ah, but if you saw what lies beneath... a priceless treasure A treasure which the wealthiest men in the province... ...could not buy with all their gold and silver A fragment of the shinbone of Saint Francois R?gis, patron of the Ard?che It's gold? Of course it's gold, with rubbies, opals, emeralds and a diamond or two But what matters that compared with the humble little bone that lies within? If all the shinbones of St Francois you see in church were collected... ...he'd be a centipede, not a saint Better a hundred legs carrying you to heaven, than two heading for hell Not so fast, we haven't had time to look I've always been particuarly devoted to St Francois R?gis Thank you for your kind words Especially displayed like that You may kiss it, as may all Christians present here That'll do, Martin I'm definitely not in form tonight You shall have your revenge after supper I'll find another for you there's no shortage of them You, too Allow me to precede him I know what you're thinking... No! I'd give everything those travellers have for his little gold church We've never killed churchmen and we're not going to start now He'd get us off to a good start, though -Have you no religion? -Have you? Yes, I respect priests, and I'd like to have one with me when I die Have you forgotten the tarot card you drew? You shouldn't have reminded me of it, Marie The death card! It will bring you misfortune All right, let him clear out right now. Otherwise, he gets it, too The good St. Francois R?gis In his youth he tended goats, as I did. We're from the same region When I talk to him, its in dialect, and he answers me the same way He watches over me... I may say ...in a very special way Have you any money, Father? What would I do with money? I belong to a mendicant order As an inn-keeper, you must know the dessert they call "mendicants" Nuts, almonds, figs and raisins The four colours of the four mendicant orders. And I am the raisin No money? Not a sou. It's against the rules of our order to possess a sou Then you must go -Go? When? -Right now -Without eating? -This is an inn, not a charity I'm not joking, Father. Take your shoes and leave here In the night? In the storm? Among wolves hungering for human flesh? -I'm sure if your wife... -She thinks as I do Very well May God will that there be hearts here less hard than yours My friends, the harshness of the world is a inconceivable thing When I think that poor St. Francois, who did so much for this area... ...has no church to bear his name, not even a chapel Not even the tinest chapel. Nothing... he has nothing It can't be true! Not true, Madame? But he himself told me so One night he came to me as I slept He looked like a poor vagabond, and that indeed is what he is, Madame A saint without a church is a poor devil without hearth or home I couldnt' believe it when he said: "I am St. Francois R?gis" If I'd had money, I'd had given it to him "Brother," he said "I have no home: build me a church" This he asked of a poor monk who cannon even buy a meal at an inn "Great Saint," I told him "you do me great honour, appearing to me "But you would be better advised to appear at Rothschild's" "Thou of litte faith," he said. "trust in the generosity of believers" Yes, but it costs money to build a church, and that money... ...must come from somewhere; it can't come from the pockets of poor monks Actually, we have no pockets; we must rely on yours I shall begin with the sceptic You'd accept my money? God does not refuse the sinner's money; he purifies it -Do not forget me, Father -Don't worry, Madame, I am coming I visit churches, I don't build them I shall pray that your father meets a happy end I gave for both of us You see? A few sous, a little silver, only gold is lacking It's too much! I want a church bell to bear my name It's a promise -What is you name? -Caroline A beautiful name for a bell Your monk's taking their money; there'll be none left for us Even our good inn-keepers are hastening to contribute their mite They will benefit from the crowds our church attracts How lovely. This, I think... ...should suffice to pay for our meal Very well. Father, so be it Since he insists, Marie, we must treat him like the rest Is it true that monks sleep on a board? And dig their own graves? A little every day -Even in winter? -Yes, why not? The ground is so hard to dig in winter Is it also true you get up in the middle of the night to sing? You must love music It isn't so much the music Why are you entering a monastery, then? Why do you ask me that? Because it seems strange at your age to say: I'll sleep on a board, dig my own grave, get up in the night to sing If you were ugly, or humpbacked, or lame... in that case... Maybe it's my soul that is ugly, or humpbacked, or lame I doubt it One mustn't go by appearances It's not how one looks that matters... not how one looks I am Jean de M?zillac. Get thee behind me, Satan! -A little more? -No, I've had enough Oh, do, it will warm you up, Father Yes, but it ruins the appetite, and I want to have a good appetite tonight We must go! Go where? To the monastery... what for? -I want to sleep on my board -It's a wonderful thing, a vacation It can wait till tomorrow. No one's going to steal it -I won't stay at this inn -God will wait another day for you -I don't want to make Him wait -I'll make your excuses Hell, I'll go alone, then! I'll have to be ruthless. Take off your boots, your feet are soaked -I should know -I know better than you All right, on your head be it, then -Where shall I put the soup? -In front of me, my child Mademoiselle, would you be so kind? Don't let him have these back. Then he won't be able to leave Now, let's all sit down to eat You come and sit beside the good Father, Janou These stools look very hard. Shall I fetch you a cushion? I think you may have difficulty finding one in this place Take you napkin and put it around your neck. And do sit up straight Be polite and pass it along. Do try to be a credit to your family Forgive me. I haven't made the introductions This young man is Jean de M?zillac, from one of our leading families The high court judge, you know Legal robes are a family tradition, but Jean has chosen a different robe... ...old, worn and patched, yet the most glorious of them all... ...the robe of poverty and mortification Lovely chestnut soup Not now, I've already started my soup It took her all of a sudden? My sevices are required to minister to someone See, Janou, I was right to stay What's the matter? I like it kept hot, too A priest, like a doctor, is not his own master I've never been out of France, but let me tell you. You, Englishmen... Your homeland is so gloomy -It isn't exactly jolly here, either -I always did so want to be a sailor Are you resting? You're not worried about dying, surely Not personally Not personally? Who, then? Hear my confession, then you'll understand Confessions arn't that easy. I haven't the things I need -What do you need? -A confessional, or some sort of grill So we can't see eachother Why? So many questions! I'm a monk, I don't ask why So one doesn't know who one's talking to, I suppose But you know it's me I won't when the grill's there You seem to be feeling better F?tiche! Bring the little chestnut grill Will that do? You're suddenly religious; you have a sin on your conscience... ...in having tried to throw a poor priest out into the storm If that sin troulbes you, don't augment it by delaying his supper I hope God will be satisfied First tell me if it's true that priests... ...never reveal what they hear in confession Listen, daughter... ...in two thousand years, and God knows that means many sins confessed... ...the secret of the confessional has never been violated St. Anselm let them tear his tongue out with red-hot pincers... ...rather than reveal an unimportant secret entrusted to him -How did they find that out? -I don't know St. Chrysostom was even worse; they cut off... Enough, Father, I believe you But would you let your tongue be taken out? No special credit to me; everything goes in one ear and out the other Doesn't anything remain between your ears? Very little, and by God's grace it vanishes when the penitent is gone Otherwise, with all we hear, you can imagine... Say your confiteor I don't remember it Then start your confession For twenty years, Father... You haven't made confession for twenty years? We'll be here a long time Even longer if you interrupt me For twenty years, Father, my husband and I have run this inn We used to be pedlars Then my husband decided we should settle down So we set ourselves up here I was suprised. "Martin," I said, "It doesn't seem very busy here "Don't worry, Marie," he said, "there won't be any dead season" "But we won't get very many customers" "Maybe not," he said, "but they'll never go elsewhere" I didn't know then what he meant -I don't, either -Wait I thought it was just fun... he liked a laugh in those days Then came our first customer, and I understood He was a fat lace-merchant, who came on horseback We kept the horse a long time The merchant, too; he's still here I remember where, because he was the first In the garden, under the chestnut tree Under the chestnut tree? In the ground? Yes, of course, as he was dead Dead? Oh, the poor soul! It must have been a shock, your first customer The second was a Parisian, a nice fellow A bachelor, which was much better Yes? Why? Because there's no one to mourn a bachelor You mean he died, too? You didn't have much luck, did you? That one didn't suffer much The third suffered even less. My husband was aquiring the knack Your husband was aquiring the knack... yes, I see... My God, I'm beginning to understand It's so easy here, you see. You noticed the staircase? The little recess. We were almost driven to it -That's where it happened? -The first three, yes -There were more? -We've lost count Lost count? Surely not more than... ten? Closer to twenty? If it were only twenty! What... thirty? Thirty-one? Really, Father, I did say "for twenty years" Thirty-one wouldn't even make two a year What's two a year? Then... how many? If you must know, tonight's was the hundred and second My God, what have I walked into? I've been telling you, Father; an inn where everybody gets killed It's quite a cemetery around here, though they arn't all under ground You can see the latest... from the window I don't see anything at all Where? In the snowman He's not badly off there. Just think, he might be inside a pig's stomach You feed Christian souls to pigs? They enjoy them all right Do you eat pork? I must say I'm not really very fond of pork -They want more pork -Good, its salty, they'll drink more -Where's Marie? -In her bedroom with the monk -What are they doing? -Roasting chestnuts I've been so worried since you came; you see, my husband is an unbeliever When he saw your little church... ...he said: "There is no God. He's in for it, too" On the stairs? Either there or in the bedroom On the stairs, its a hammer. In the rooms, a knife But don't worry, Father, the brew we give them ensures they feel nothing This is not a very serious matter Your husband is behind the door You must not torment yourself; you are not in need of purification Nor must you ask for absolution; to do so would be a waste of time... ...and to squander God's good grace; a humble benediction will suffice Depart in peace, my child I need you downstairs Arn't you at table yet? I'll go at once Now you'll forget all I said It's forgotten; you never said a word -Don't you feel well? -Not very, my legs are giving way A drop of Arquebuse... Thank you, this should steady them enough to send me on my way You mean you won't be staying with us? No, I think I'd better not The weather seems to be improving. The storm is abating Your inn is thoroughly respectable, of course... ...but I think my young novice should sleep at the monastery Very well, Father We shall be sorry to loose you, but if you think best... May I light your way, Father? Be careful! The stairs are dangerous So I see. An accident would not surprise me -Don't tempt fate -Just a passing thought A sweet child She is almost engaged, you know -To whom? -A gendarme... a sergeant, in fact You see why, of course In a business like ours... ...it helps Right? You doubtless refer to matters about which my mind is a blank, as I recall A pleasant journey, Father Thank you, and good health to you Thank you, and good health to you and all yours This is not goodbye You are always welcome here Thank you, I'll remember that... yes, I'll remember... At last! Where has he been? Aren't you hungry? Had you forgotten us? Join us, Father! Yes, I had indeed forgotten you. My God... how frightful -What's frightful? -Nothing, nothing... Then do sit down, Father. We've kept your soup hot No... no soup A nice piece of pork, then No pork... especially no pork These ladies and gentlemen found it to their taste You are making a mistake. I assure you Such flavour, these local pigs Really, you must taste it You've come to the wrong place if you don't like pork That's literally all we've eaten: sausages, ham, roasted... My friends... all of you eating together around this table... Eat well Eat well, too, Father It won't go down But you were starving. What happened? What's wrong? My eyes are bigger than my belly, that's what's wrong But you seem unhappy It's not that I'm unhappy I'm uneasy Not so much noise. Can't you see I've got an ear to the dining-room? What's he saying? He doesn't feel well and he wants to leave for the monastery right away See? All it took was a word from me So you'll go part of the way with me? The fresh air will do us good -Will you, Milord? -If everyone else is going Marie, he's taking them away with him What did you tell him in that bedroom? You spilled the beans. You sold me out for a monk I'm plagued by priests We need lanterns! The good Father is carrying us off... it's such fun! Leave this to me You shall have your lanterns Have you come for your boots? I've hidden them -Where? -You're very curious for a monk I dont' care, anyway, because that's not what I came for You're not very curious for a girl Come on, they're in the barn God led us to this place You're always talking about God Suppose it was the devil? God or the devil, I don't care either way You'd go to hell with me, little monk? This very moment Not this very moment, but some day I'll go to hell with you, and it won't be hell If the good Father could hear you... I won't tell him like that. Poor soul, it would grieve him too much What will you tell him? I'll say: forgive me, Father... ...but when I wanted to be a monk, I didn't know I'd meet Mathilde I knew nothing, and now I know too much to be a monk The wisest monk of all knows less than I do Yes, I feel a little tired I don't want to die here, so I'd best get back Taking our customers You know why Yes, they're going to see me on my way, not far, just to the monastery But that's at least seven leagues You told us it was just a stone's throw I didn't say what sort of throw Using a sling isn't the same as throwing by hand; and a cannon... Seven leagues in the snow? At my age! But you can't miss the way On your right you'll hear the wolves howling, on the forest side On your left you'll hear the torrent, on the precipice side Wretch, don't you want them saved Even more to be feared... ...are unpleasant encounters... ...with miscreants lurking, ready to rob unfortunate travellers Come now, that's an old wives' tale; there are no highwaymen these days Follow me, rebellious flock I'd rather die! Foolish woman, If only you knew If only one knew what, Father? Nothing... Janou... where is Janou? The priest might leave, all the same Madmen must be protected against themselves Take this, and keep it safe Wanton boy! A momentary weakness is pardonable; we shall speak of it later Now, to the monastery You refuse to return? Wretched boy! Don't, he's mine now, not yours! But your vocation... My vocation is to love her until I die Which may not be long I shall love her even after, if that is permitted to the dead Come, Janou, I must talk to you Think of your father; you can't bring a high court judge into such a family He can stay away if he prefers I hardly recogonize you. Your face has become harder... ...your voice more cruel... If that is what you call love... I didn't say I loved you Goodbye, Janou. Your sin will be your undoing It's just too bad then Evidently there wasn't one virtuous soul worthy of salvation in this house Just one, and thats me. Although even then... ...I'm not so sure of being deserving Open, I tell you! Trying to leave us? Caught like a rat! The key... where's the key? Hunt the key! I don't find it funny. Let me leave No one's stopping you, Father. Hunt the key! Stop it, you wicked people! You needn't go on looking. We gave it to the black To him! Not that way! -Where, then? -This way Be sensible, Father, and go to bed I'm not sleepy. Let me go. I'm not sleepy -How else will you get upstairs? -I don't want to go upstairs! I want to go to the monastery; that's what St. Francois wants me to do It's the best room And it's yours, Father -I tell you I'm not sleepy -Tell your beads, then I'm going to bed fully dressed; I'll just take off my shoes My God, it's cold! We'll be frozen stiff -We'll catch our deaths -I'm going to sleep downstairs It is cold, but nice hot drinks are being prepared for you They'll be brought up when you're in bed Two cups for me I think your opium's a bit musty, Marie; double the dose I want them asleep The monk... his shaveling... ...the Marquise... the Milord... ...the big ox... ...the Parisienne... her popenjay -What do you want? -There's no key to my door? -You won't need one -Why is there a keyhole, then? Playing with wardrobes is dangerous; you might be crushed to death -What's this? -It's something to warm you up I'm not a bit cold My teeth aren't really chattering Yes, they are. Drink this, it will make you feel better It's hot... really hot... much too hot I'll drink it later No, now. We need the bowls All right, I'll drink it, but it is hot It's hot, but good. How do you make it? Let me have the recipe Another? No, that would be gluttony But I would like some light What for? You're going to sleep right away Close the door Between ourselves, what did you think of that hot drink? With plenty of whisky, it wasn't bad -And how do you feel now? -All right, thanks Absolutely all right? You're concerned about my health? I wouldn't like anything to happen to you Mind if I go to sleep? Wouldn't you like to talk for a while? A game of cards, perhaps? Cards? No, thats really out of the question It's forbidden by our order, absolutely Good night, then Don't go to sleep! -Where are the cards? -In my trousers -Where are your trousers? -On my head What stakes? You know a mendicant friar has no money You were given some a little while ago But that isn't mine, it belongs to St. Francois R?gis I only play cards for money Very well, if needs must Forgive me, worthy saint No, I tell you, not for him Who hasn't had one? Misfortune has descended on this house. Mademoiselle Mathilde is in love The shaveling; she prevented him from drinking You're not to touch Janou How can he be saved if we kill all the others? You know it's all or nothing. Mathilde Then tonight it's going to be nothing What did I tell you? There'll be other travelers, but I'll never find another Janou It's a pity, but he's for it like all the rest I'll denounce you to the gendarmes Then I'll come and see you guillotined. Don't touch me, or I'll shout They're all asleep -Janou isn't asleep -Then call him F?tiche, the axe Go on, call him He's not far away, he'll hear you I'll play you for your little piggy bank The reliquary? No, sir, never! Oh yes, indeed! I like your little church very much Don't leave me alone... wake up! I'll reveal the secret. If I'm damned, it can't be helped Terrible things are going on here It would take the trump of doom! Wake up, unhappy man! Your life is in danger... wake up! Darling... Oh Lord, the state of their souls appearing before You Wake up! -St. Francois R?gis -No, I'm not him, Madame What am I to do? I'll upend the bed You again! There must be a hole You come, you go, ferreting into everything I'd love to go Not so fast, we have an account to settle first I've done nothing Who emptied my travellers' pockets, then, like taking a church collection? For good works And who tried to get them to leave? Who brought along a little priestling to turn my daughter's head? She wants to marry your shaveling What's the use, now the harm is done? Let me try, at least How can you marry a poor boy dedicated to God? He can't make a good husband It's him I want, and nobody else Listen to your father, Mademoiselle I've made the best possible choice for her, a sergeant in the gendarmerie A most excellent choice, Mademoiselle I don't want him! You see? It's hopeless, a fine job you've made of it F?tiche, take him back to his room To sleep while you are troubled? No, parental respect is my vocation Such fine people... a father who has made so many sacrifices for you Try to put yourself in his place thinking to himself: "I've worked hard and well , but you never know, tomorrow's another day "Suppose there's trouble, a traveller complains..." Right, Monsieur Martin? You kill yourself trying, but people are never satisfied Now, a gendarme in the family means security in business People think twice before saying anything against you I'd even say it's unwise not to have a gendarme in a family like yours She's as stubborn as her mother Sometimes a son-in-law like that, in troubled times... I don't want any gendarme! You see? But there's a reckoning to come Still, she's partly right Now he backs her up! I mean to speak no ill of gendarmes, but after all, what is a gendarme... ...in the vast system that is society? A gendarme is there to arrest people That's a good start Yes, but who gives the gendarmes their orders? Tell me who? The judges. If I were in your position, you and Madame... ...I'd be wondering if I couldn't do better than a gendarme A judge! Even better than merely a judge Come now, have a little ambition for your daughter If it comes to the worst, who decides whether you go to the guillotine... ...or whether you don't go to the guillotine? The high court judge What's this about guillotines? Just a passing thought It's better to appeal to God than His saints, I've always been told Well, legally speaking, the high court judge is God You hear that, Marie? A high court judge! What nonsense Do you expect me to marry her to a high court judge? They're old men and she's a girl; it would be disgusting Yes, but high court judges... ...have eligible sons None that I know of There is one, though... in your barn What does your father do? I asked how does your father spend his time He's probably asleep at this hour No, his profession, I mean He's the high court judge High court judge? The one who sits in the middle and is always right? You're sure he's still in business? Then take her... my daughter's yours Will his father agree? That's right, will he? No matter even if he doesn't Are you sure? God himself would be delighted to marry such a handsome young pair Will you marry them, then? Me? Oh, well, you see... I don't mind Let's loose no time, then Not in a stable at dead of night. One would think you are ashamed I see a ceremony worthy of both families, with a large congregation We have a congregation... the travellers You can't wake those poor people Why not? Some strong coffee will do it -There are only five of them -Seven, with the coachmen Even seven isn't very many. I don't want to find any of them missing I shall count them. Let's shake on it, Monsieur Martin It's a deal! Lord, what a long night that was The organ-grinder's monkey! We found the poor brute alone under a tree. Have you seen its master? Yesterday, heading for Peyrabeille with his organ and the monkey Look at your daughter That's your wedding gown. I remember it well; unpleasant memories die hard If I hadn't kept this, you'd lack music at your wedding Well... a wedding I don't know why they're sleeping so. I made them some nice coffee You see, its almost as nice as in a church Wretched woman, how did these objects of piety fall into your hands Did you kill a priest? No, not a priest. He was a hawker selling devotional articles I see, a hawker. That's reassuring to hear Listen, Janou... No, I won't listen -Before you decide... -Everything's settled, Father -I must talk to you -It's too late for talk You think so? Very well, I shall speak in front of everyone No whispering, now. What are we waiting for? Before pronouncing the words which will make this man and this woman... ...one soul and one flesh... ...there is something I feel impelled to say Is a sermon necessary? Indispensable, I'd say No sermon could make these people sleep any more soundly So get on with the wedding and send them on their way without wasting time I'm not wasting their time; I'll show them a short cut -Through the little wooden bridge? -Yes, the bridge That's a rich thought... an excellent thought! Never have I solemnized a marriage without a sense of anxiety... ...sometimes even anguish... all too often, alas, proven to be justified Our two young frinds, of course, seem destined for lasting happiness But it's said that the engagement is the happiest time of a marriage... That's not far wrong, either This marriage is costing us dear. If we'd at least kept the travellers... Who said we wouldn't? I promised that they'd attend the wedding But afterwards... accidents happen so easily Marriage calls for love, and having expended your love in getting married... ...you realize that all you have left is the marriage Two souls clinging to each other, advancing to... I won't say death... ...because, married or not, we all come to death But married couples come to it faster. The proof being that priests bury them Where you are headed, my children... ...if you say "yes", which is no better a word than "no"... ...it's towards a world as grey as ashes... ...which they call the world of marriage There you watch eath other grow old, ill, ugly. "Will I be the first to go?" Some sermon! Don't... its all so true Children, you will say Yes, there are children, of course, and children are sweet "Suffer the little children to come unto me", Jesus said But what children? Other people's children. He wasn't married If being married was so wonderful, wouldn't He have been? Hear that? Woodcutters How sounds carry in the snow. You'd think it was right close by Rotten job woodcutters have I'd rather be a gendarme That is why, considering all the dangers that threaten a young couple... ...the storm clouds gathering on the horizon of their marriage... ...and in which one hears the first rumbles of thunder... ...this is why one wonders wheather this sacrament, indissoluble contract... Remember that: once in, you're in for life... Is this sacrament absolutely necessary? Many do quite happily without it What's he saying? I'm putting the freethinker's point of view. The Christian, of course... Look at them, Monsieur Martin. This isn't a wedding, its a dormitory I can't talk in these conditions You've talked enough. Get on with it and marry them, at the double It won't be a happy memory for them to look back on. However... Goodness gracious! My mind has gone blank. I can't remember the words of the ceremony So you can't remember the words? Wait, I think they're coming back to me The congregation must stand for the benediction -Isn't the wedding finished yet? -It won't be long now Let's get it over with My goodness, how stupid of me You rushed me so much that we forgot the rings Can't we do without? Of course one can do without But we have already done without a Mass... ...without a chruch, bridesmades or alter-boys Very well, but don't call this a wedding; it's like... nothing on earth What's got into you? He scents his master Hold out you hands, Father Take these back What's wrong with the rings? They're burning my hands Haven't you chosen two yet? Jean de M?zillac, do you take this woman to be your lawful wedded wife? Mathihlde Martin, do you take... Hide the barrel-organ! Thank You, Lord! What can we do for you? We have good news for the organ-grinder; we've found his monkey Where's that monkey got to? Its master will get it down He'll owe us a drink for all our trouble Its master isn't here Not here? But we heard his organ He left last night Leaving his organ? He left it as security Organ, monkey, what else could he loose? Only his life Odd, though, a man leaving the tools of his trade behind Unusual, isn't it? Let's see the organ Where is it, F?tiche? In the hay? I'm marrying my daughter and the groom has said "Yes". Can we continue? No, go about your duty It will give the bride time to think things over A strange place to put an organ One would think you were hiding it We've nothing to hide here This must be worth a lot of money -He paid dearly for his dinner -He ate and drank a great deal Enough to make him die of apoplexy It's strange he should leave in the middle of the night, don't you think? He can't have gone far in this cold Well, pending discovery of the corpse, my dear rogue... ...and offering no thanks for the shaft you could have loaned us... ...had greed not overcome your Christian charity - let us take our leave of you And of your charming daughter, who may make her vows without our aid Let me kiss a hand as yet unadorned by a wedding ring My God, my snowman! Can't we get by? Don't touch my snowman! I set great store by my snowman That's not going to stop us taking the carriage out This is too much. I'm in charge here and I do as I want I've had enough, Monsieur Martin I warn you, I shall get really angry Aren't you ashamed to be playing with snowmen at your age, Monsieur Martin? What's so special about your snowman? I'll make you another, there's snow enough If you haven't moved this out of our coach's way in two minutes... ...whether by fire, sword, or your own two hands... ...my companions in misfortune and I are determined... It's a souvenir -It's where we met, Janou and I -Can this leave your hearts unmoved? Enough! We've wasted one night already Couldn't we move it, if we're very careful? -What do you think, F?tiche? -Four of us might do it Leave it to us; you'd just ruin it, you big brute Lord, you can't let them get away with it Oh Lord, You did! Careful, it's toppling. Couldn't you have built it somewhere else? Can't you leave us alone? What have we done to you? Defend us! They don't mean any harm Aim at the head! He's having such fun You see, Marie? That'll teach you to protect priests I've told the coachman the way. You'll be there in an hour. Won't you come with us, Father? We'll all dine together in Privas At the Cloche d'Or I don't think I'll be staying in an inn for a while You're really departing this time I'll ride with you until our ways part For the last time, wretched boy... -Until I die, I said -But the girl isn't you wife It's true, Janou. I never said "I will" You just did Murderers! We'll come and see you guillotined! Cursed priest! The secret of the confessional. "I'd rather have my tongue torn out"! And you believed him? That's what religion does to you, poor fool! I didn't use my tongue; I never said a word You should be seeking forgiveness in heaven You might be there, so I'd better go to hell! Look, Marie, they're heading straight for the little bridge What a pity, it's such a waste Me betray the confessional? It's unthinkable I simply thew a snowball at a snowman's hat That's all I did. God did the rest You did give Him a helping hand, though You're not going to blame him for that? He was wonderful I only did my humble duty, a silent presence, like a guardian angel It wasn't always easy, keeping you from falling into traps However, the main thing is you're safe Here's the little bridge. Goodbye, I'll leave you now Pray for us, Father Goodbye, my friends, goodbye May St. Francois R?gis watch over you Depart in peace The moral: Hear this tale of bloody events And hearken to its dire portents Only those who obey virtue's call God's mercy is sure to fall
