Yes, I suppose this is out of character for eva. The police are out looking. I know this seems impossible, But try not to imagine the worst-case scenario. -First dad, now this. -Yes. Does make one wonder. What do you mean? From the moment eva called to tell me he was gone, I knew something was off. A healthy 34-year-old man Doesn't drop dead for no reason. -He had a heart attack. -And now your mother disappears. Right as I'm pushing for a second autopsy.

I have refreshed my emails, like, 20 times the last hour. -Still nothing. -You're gonna get it, I know it. Thank you. I, uh, I thought you'd given up on this one. No, I, I just figured I owed it to ryan to get it running again. If it bothers you, I can put it in the garage. No, no, it's... I know how much ryan enjoyed rebuilding it with you. It's a nice memory to have. -[cell phone vibrating] -oh. Hang on, sorry. -Oh. -Everything okay over there? Yeah, it's just this guy clint. Just can't take a hint. Uh, first guy I go out on a date with, And it turns out this guy is a, uh, total creep. Yeah, wasn't that date, like, weeks ago? -He's still calling you? -Yeah. And the worst part is that I left My favorite earring in the back of his car. Well, you know, if you want, I could, uh, make sure He leaves you alone. You know, well... Oh, yeah, I can be very intimidating. -Oh, wow, tough guy. Okay. -Oh, yeah. Yeah. Wow, I got this. Actually, I'm gonna just block his number. -So... Thank you. - Yeah. Smart. After the year you had, you can't be too careful. Yeah. Anyways, what about you? Now that your divorce is finalized, Are you gonna finally ask my friend ashley out or what? -Oh, come on. Get out of here. -Come on! What would she want with a guy like me? You gotta give yourself a little more credit. -[chuckles] come on, I'm a mess. -Okay.

Okay. All right, ten more minutes. -Love you. -I love you. Sleep tight. [door shuts] [eerie music] [dramatic music] [laptop beeps] Got it. [engine revving] [ominous music] [exhales sharply] [engine revving] Ah. Dane! Dane! Dane! -Dane, there's a car. -What? What's going on? Car. Uh, there's a car. It's following me. [panting] There was. Someone was following me. What kind of car? Did you see who was driving? I don't know. Well, what about a license-plate number? -[mumbles] -uh, here, here, sit. But I didn't... I didn't get one. [breathing heavily] I don't know, maybe it was nothing. What are you doing joggin' in the snow anyways? [sighs] I don't know. Just clears my head, I guess. I don't know, maybe I just panicked. Maybe it's nothing. Clearly, I'm just easily rattled these days. Eva, you were kidnapped out of your own driveway and they never Caught the guy, if you think someone is following you, You should go to the police. I think we both know what a Waste of time that would be. I mean, if they didn't believe me then, Why would they believe me now? [sighs] I just wish I got my life back. You don't have to go through this alone. Seriously, if you need anything. Yeah, no, thank you. I really appreciate you Looking out for me. -Yeah. -[car door shuts] -[dane] oh. -Wow. This day couldn't get any better. -Nancy for dinner again, huh? -Yup. That woman can't go one week without telling me How terrible of a parent I am. -Helpful. -Very helpful.

[chuckling] -Where are you headed? -Nowhere. Okay, so did you finally give my friend ashley a call? -Wouldn't you like to know? -I would like to know. Text me when you're done. I want all the hot goss. Yeah, I-I think nancy needs you. I could use some help with these, if you're not too busy. [dane chuckles] Yeah. I may have some news myself. I'll be right there, nancy. [eva] oh, wow, you went all out! Thank you so much, nancy, this is delicious. My pleasure. Grace, well, have a few more vegetables there. -Please. There's plenty. -Grace, just a few. Mom, what's the big news? So, 9 moon offered me the job As the creative director for their head office. Wait! 9 moon fashion house? -Yes. -Mom, that's amazing! Well, I mean, we're still working out the details, But, um, it comes with great perks and full health benefits. And the best part is they're gonna let me work On my own designs. -It's kind of a win-win. -Wait. Isn't their head office in new york? -Mm-hmm. -So, we'd be moving? What about school and our friends? Well, you'll make new friends and you'll go to a new school. I mean, that's exciting, right? Plus, this isn't just an opportunity for me, It's for you girls as well. Sami, you could go To the design school after you graduate. -Think about the opportunities. -Yeah, but we have a life here. -Well, I know, but-- -if you needed money... I wish you would've asked. I-I don't, nancy, but thank you. Regardless, you can't sell this house. This was yours and ryan's first home. It'll be a fabulous first home for another couple. Right? New york's a fresh start for all of us. Moving across country isn't going to bury your past, eva. What's that supposed to mean, nancy? There are too many unanswered Questions regarding ryan's death! Moving away while his case is unsolved Is simply irresponsible. Don't you want to know what happened to him? Girls, do you mind... Just go to your room for Just a second. No, stay. -The matter of their father's-- -nancy, stop! He had a heart attack. Why can't you understand that? Why can't you accept that? The facts of his death remain as murky As your apparent kidnapping. So easy for you to believe that ryan was killed, But it's-it's very difficult for you to understand That I was, I was taken. Oh, yes, by someone who happened To drop you back in your own front yard? I was in a diabetic coma, nancy. You think I did that to myself? Then who did it, eva? Who kidnapped you? Oh, that's right, you can't remember. How convenient. Get out of my house. [nancy] excuse me? You heard me. Get out. [intense music] Congratulations on your job, mom. Really. Girls, wait. Grace. [scoffs] [music continues] [music continues] [intense music] [gabe] so I got, uh, a for question 46. What about you? Sami? Everything okay? Yeah, sorry. My mom dropped this bombshell on us tonight. I don't know, I'm still trying to process everything. -[gabe] what did she say? -Wow, it's later than I thought. I should go talk to her. I'll see you tomorrow? Yeah. Night. [instrumental music] [knocking on door] Mom, can we talk? Mom, I'm sorry. Mom? See you at breakfast. I love you. Goodnight. -[clattering] -mom? Mom? Mom? Mom? Mom? Mom? Okay, so when was the last time you both saw her? Uh, around 4:00, I think, right around when nancy arrived. And she didn't seem off in any way? She did say she thought Someone was following her earlier that day. -What? Who? -Sami, go to your room. -Let the adults handle this. -She didn't get a good look. But said they drove a dark car. -And you? -Um... I-I left the house around 6:00. Is that it? -They had an argument. -About? [chuckles] family matters. That's enough from you. Okay, well, I've got your statements. So I will reach out when we've got something. Wait, you're leaving? You've been here, what, 20 minutes? Well, there's not a lot we can do right now. What are you even saying? You should be out looking for her. -We all should. -I understand you're concerned. But we don't wanna jump the gun. Nobody's jumping the gun. My mom's obviously been taken again Because you couldn't find her kidnapper the first time. Sami, show the officer some respect. An open window and one knocked-over vase Aren't necessarily signs of a struggle. I mean, you told me you were in your bedroom all night. She could've just as easily walked out the front door. [sami] without her phone or her purse? Well, you'd be surprised how common that is For people having breakdowns. A breakdown? So she just left and we all just have to accept it? Give it 48 hours, and if your mom isn't back by then, call me. -[grace] sami, what's going on? -Wonderful. You've woken up your sister. Sami, sami! [sami] detective campbell! [dane] sami! Hey, it's gonna be okay. How do you know? You're right, I don't. Dane, look. -[dane] careful. Sami! -Hey! [clicks camera] Sami, stop! Hey. Chasing after random cars isn't gonna bring your mom back. What am I supposed to do? Did you get a picture of the license plate? Send it to campbell. Come on. [sobbing] [instrumental music] [cell phone vibrating] [dramatic music] [knocking on door] Do you remember, after your father died, How I came to stay with you girls for a week Because eva went on vacation? She wasn't on vacation, sami. Your mother fell apart. I was grieving my son, And I had to put that on hold to pick up her pieces. I didn't want you or your sister seeing that. But your mother, she... She deals with stressful situations in her own way. She, um, you know, has trouble facing things head-on. Last year was just a practice run. This is the real thing. No. She would never leave us. I wish I could believe that. That's mine. You leave this mess to me. I've cleaned it up once before. Pretty sure I was there last year, too. And after everything that's happened, you're still Treating me like a child. Get some rest, you girls Will be staying with me starting tomorrow. [instrumental music] Where are you, mom?

Please let me out! What do you want? Let me out of here. [captor on speaker] you're not ready. Sami? -I hate it here. -Tell me about it. It's like living in a haunted art gallery. We should be at home. We're old enough to stay by ourselves. It's only for a little bit, until mom comes back. How do you know she's coming back? Because she'd never leave us. You know that, right? [nancy] sami, grace, lunchtime! Let's go. [ominous music] [door creaking] [intense music] My bedroom's off-limits. You're not to go in there. Do you understand? [cutlery clanking] -Is this fizzy? -Mm-hmm. We haven't had it in forever, mom won't buy it Anymore since dad... Yes, well, I know how much you two enjoy it. Your father did as well. [cell phone vibrating] Has detective campbell called you yet? -What are the police doing? -Rest assured. They're doing everything they can. Like what? Are they organizing a search party? Are they doing a press conference to alert People that she's missing? Sami, leave this all-- To you? Yeah. You said that already. I will call detective campbell after lunch and get an update. But you have to promise to let this be. Now, let's finish our lunch. Afterwards you girls may watch some television if you like. [sighs] so, how you doing? I'm great, thanks for asking. Sorry, I know this is tough. No, I'm sorry. I feel like I'm in this never-ending nightmare And I can't shake myself awake. Do you think your grandma would let you have visitors? I can stop by and give you some company and... -I don't know, we could. -[sighs] -What? -My pencil crayons. I must've left them at the house. Well, couldn't you use something different? It's not the same. I better go get them. Sami, are you sure that's a good idea? Gabe, I need to get out of here. I can't stay cooped up for another second. Let me come pick you up. No, that old junker will just alert my dungeon master. It's a quick bus ride. It's cool. Okay, well, just, uh, Shoot me a text when you get there, so I know you're okay. -I will. Bye. -Bye.

Just twi-twist it, make a loop and... Oh, for heaven sakes, we're casting on. -Not casting for fish. -That's what I'm doing. Can we go outside or something? I think some air will do us all good. Later, sami. Let's enjoy this nice, Quiet morning while we can. Yes? [cell phone vibrating] Excuse me a moment.

Uh, you shouldn't be at the house, sami. -It's an active crime scene. -Funny. -You don't seem very active. -[sighs] This guy, did you get a good look at him? Height, build, anything that makes him stand out? Not very tall, but not short. Regular build. Look, I can sketch him out and send it to you if that'll help. Any idea why he'd be at your house? I don't know. But he seemed to know my mom. -And was super creepy. -Okay. Send me the sketch and I'll look into it. -Wait? Is that it? -Is there something else? No, but this is taking too long. What if she's... What if whoever has her wants to hurt her? [sighs] we're doing everything in our power to find your mom. In the meantime, you can't be running around at all hours. -I found you a suspect. -Sami! I need you to stay at your grandmother's house, Where it's safe.
