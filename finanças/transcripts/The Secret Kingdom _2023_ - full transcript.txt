Many moons ago, when the lands of The Above and The Below were one, a young king ruled with a power of imagination so great that his very thoughts brought light and peace to all. But near the 12th year of his reign, a great tragedy befell the young king, and his grief so great, split the world... ...into the lands of The Above and The Below, where all memory of the tragedy was buried. And so it was that time stood still... ...and a great darkness fell across the land. And in that darkness grew a creature made of fear itself. A creature known as the Shroud. Peter, ça va? Are you okay? Yeah. Yeah. "Welcome to Wilson." This is it! This is it! This is it! Wow! Verity. Come on, Peter. I used to spend my summers here when I was a kid. This place has everything that we've ever dreamt of. High ceilings, period features. Peeling of paint, rising of damp, cracking everywhere. That's where the light gets in. Come on, let's go take a look. Peter, ça va? Try and make it there in three seconds. Did you make it? Come on, we can do this. Mon Dieu! How long do we have to stay here? Oh, no, no. We are just here to clean. Look what I found. Wow! They're in here too. They're quite wonderful. I will keep them. Treasure, careful. The floors look very old. Okay, Mama. It has a swimming pool! Hello, Mr. Frog Prince. I'm the fairy queen. That's-- That's not a swimming pool. I was only talking to the Frog Prince. There's no such thing as a "frog prince." You know, I once saved your mother from a frog prince. Ah, smell that. That's the smell of inspiration. Who could be calling? Close your eyes. What do you see? I see magical creatures and a wondrous kingdom. And I am their queen. The Kingdom of Imagination awaits you. What is thy decree, Your Majesty? What do you see, Peter? Come on, Pete. Think outside the box. What do you see? David, there's a moving truck. Okay, why don't you go get cleaned up? Oh, no! I'm late for the royal tea party! I'm not even dressed for it yet! David? Vivianne, we lost the house. The bank foreclosed. What? But we had time. This is the change that we really need. It's only been a year, and I'm still dealing with this too. All right! This family loses too much. Come on, Peter. Quickly, we have to go. Verity, wait. Where are you going? Verity, come back! Verity! Wait! I found it! The entrance to the Land of Nowhere. Quickly, it's about to close up forever. Verity. Verity. Verity. Verity. Verity. Quickly. She knows we're here. I smell something. Verity, get out of there. Now. I smell children. Come out, young lady. Let me see you in that pretty coat. Hi, I'm Verity, and this is Peter. We just moved here today, but Peter's not very happy about it. Could you really smell us? Verity, come on. What do I smell like? You smell of sugar, spice and all things nice, of course. Does Peter smell of slime and snails? No, he smells of something else. Fear. Fear of things he does not yet see. That was very clumsy. No, no, it wasn't me. There was a rat or something in the wall. A rat? Yes. I-- I mean, well, there was something. I saw something. How much is it? This is all I have. Just the right amount. For now. Okay. Verity, let's go. Don't forget your purchase. No, thank you. You can keep it. No, no, no, Your Majesty. It is yours now. Smell you later. Come on, Verity. We found it. We found it. Hey, it's late. Where have you been? Well-- No, no, no, no. Wait up. Wait up, Peter. Wait, come here. I need your help with something. Okay. I want you to close your eyes and imagine the very best think you can. I love this game. I'm going to catch the best think ever. Choose a hand. I'm no good at this. Come on, come on. You used to love this game. Give it a go. Use your imagination. I'm sure there's still some magic in there. Have you got a think yet? I'm thinking. Okay. Great. What did you do, Peter? You let them all out. Peter, where have you been? Are you okay? Hold on. I have something for you. Grandpa's compass. He promised this to you, yes? If not for this compass, you and I may not be here. In the first war, this saved him many times. Okay, okay, no hugs. Do you hear that? Can't you hear that noise? A funny thing licked my ear. It's really sticky. Can't you hear that? I need the thing. Ugh, what thing? The thing you broke in the store. I need it. Why? I'm not supposed to say. It's magic. Look, Verity, I'm in no mood for your games. Just go back to bed. So, can I have it? You're not gonna let up, are you? Just-- If you want it so badly, I'll sell it to you. One penny, two penny, three penny, four penny-- Verity, just stop. Give me the jar, and I'll give you the battered puzzle thing. Peter! Peter! Jump! Peter! Please! Peter! Don't let me go! Verity, are you okay? Peter, I'm scared. It's okay. It's gonna be okay. Hold on. There's nothing there. There's nothing there. There's nothing there. There's nothing there. There's nothing there. There's nothing there. Peter, open your eyes. They're everywhere. No, they're not. There's nothing there. Stop saying that! We're gonna close our eyes, and we're gonna count to three. Then we're gonna open our eyes, and we're gonna see there's nothing there. All right? One, two, three. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no. - Peter, they said to hold on tight! - What? No. No! Is that so? Well, thank you. Don't worry, Peter. They're very friendly. Who are you talking to? Oh, of course. He can't understand you yet. Peter, you have to hold very still. You'll find it tickles, but it doesn't hurt a bit. What do you mean? What are you talking about? Oh! What was that? Your satchel, sire. They can talk. They can talk. Well, of course they can. Um... Huh... What is the meaning of this? General Rumph, we are victorious. We have saved the king. And just in time. You fools! You've risked our position for nothing. This is just a child. Our king shall not be judged by his years, but by his deeds. He looks most important. Look, Verity, I'll do the talking. Why? Because I'm the oldest, and that's the rule. That is not a rule. You just made that up. These guards have deliberately broken protocol. We now risk a direct attack from the Shroud. Protocol does not trump prophecy, my dear general. Respectfully, the pangolin have lost too many to this prophecy of yours. And many more shall be lost, should the prophecy not prevail. I have waited for this day a long time. A long, long time. Welcome, Your Majesty. Why, thank you. - I'm Verity, and this is Peter. - Shh. Who are you, and why have you brought us here? My apologies, Your Majesty. I am Elwyn, leader of the pangolin. Keepers of the prophecy. Your arrival was foretold many moons ago. I'm sorry, but I think you've mistaken me for someone else. You are Peter. You are to reunite our two great lands and restore light and peace to The Below. No, but that can't possibly be me. I just moved here today. You carry with you an object of great, great power. A golden piece inscribed with the language of prophecy. You mean-- You mean this? Behold your king. No, no. Everyone, everyone, this is just a big misunderstanding. I'm not a king. My brothers and sisters, on this great, great day, the prophecy has delivered unto us our promised king. Come, Your Majesty. There is much for you to see. No, Verity, wait. Come on, Peter. We mustn't keep them waiting. No. I'm sorry, but we don't belong here, and we really have to get back home. But I don't wanna go home yet. The portal to The Above has been closed for your protection. The way back is shut. But do not fear, young Peter. Your path ahead is quite clear. Your Majesty. Your Majesty. Your Majesty. Oh, I just love your dress. Ooh, Your Majesty. Hello. It's lovely to meet you all. Pling. Yes, sir. You're late. Um, yes, Uncle. I-I mean, sir. Sorry. It won't happen again. What did I miss? The compass! It's him! I mean, you. You're here. You're really here. Oh-Oh, my. I-- I mean, Your Majesty. Pling, fetch the sacred book and join us in the cave. Um, yes. Of course, Uncle. I-I mean, Master Elwyn. It's really you! Now, Pling. Of course, Uncle. Wow! Pling. Oh. Uh... Behold the prophecy. Wow! It's a bird. And a dragon. Oh, wait, there, look! A unicorn! This part of the prophecy tells of the time before. The time when the lands of The Above and The Below were one. A time before the Shroud. Um, I mean no disrespect, but why are we here? That looks like me in my pretty nightdress. That's my necklace. It can't be. That's impossible. This is the foretelling of your arrival. "A golden piece from deepest cave. A chosen king, both fair and brave, whom guardians from below will save. Pieces five, a king will find and in the Citadel will bind to defeat the Shroud and reset time." What does it mean? It speaks of the great clock of the Citadel that has the power to bring the light back to The Below. What was that? The Shroud has found us. I warned you. Hold your ground. Assemble a troop and prepare for safe passage. The king must not be harmed. If he is the king, let him face it. He is not yet ready. What's a shroud? The Shroud is a creature said to be made of fear itself. It is indeed the nemesis of the king. When we heard it had bridged the boundary between our two worlds, we knew it would come for you. We knew it was time. That is why we have brought you here. Why does it want Peter? It fears but one thing: the power of the king. I-I'm sorry. I can't possibly be your king. I don't have any power. I don't belong here. You are everything the prophecy promised. Your path ahead is clear. You must find the missing pieces and take them to the great clock of the Citadel. But I'm not brave or powerful or anything. All you need is within you. But what if-- What if you're wrong? Then all shall be lost. All will be forgotten. I'm here. Sorry, Master. I thought I'd put it under "P" for "prophecy," but it was somewhere else. Amongst these pages are the five lost songs of prophecy. Each one reveals the location of a piece of the great clock. There's-- There's nothing in here. The songs are hidden. Hidden from the Shroud. You will go to the Luminere. He will teach you to see them. Take them at once. You must go through the stronghold. The Shroud's minions are everywhere. You will take them to the Luminere. It is foretold. These are my orders. Trust no one. The Shroud has many forms and many under its control. The Luminere will help you to see all that you must see. Hurry. You must leave now. Pling, you will go with them. Me? Really? You are to be their navigator. Oh! Thank you, Uncle. I mean, Master Elwyn. I live to serve Your Majesty. May the prophecy guide you. ♪ Rocks, count ten Then paces four ♪ ♪ One, two, three, four ♪ ♪ Shine a light For a hidden door ♪ ♪ Shine a light Shine a light ♪ ♪ Three-holed lock Fit for a claw ♪ ♪ Click clock Twist the lock ♪ No. That's the right. Hmm. Excuse me, Your Majesty. You can call me Peter. Yes, Your Majesty. I don't think this is the right way. This is the wrong song. The wrong song? What do you mean by that? We use songs to remember the paths to places. Each line tells us where to go. This is not the song to the Luminere, sire. Uh, General Rumph, may I ask, where are we going? We journey to the stronghold. But Mr. Elwyn said for you to take us to the Luminere. There'll be no more talk of this prophecy nonsense. Well, that's very disobedient. While you're under my protection, you'll do exactly as I say. Hey. Hey! I command you to take us to the Luminere immediately. You command me? Insolent child, you're no king. But you were given your orders, and we have to see the Luminere. I've seen what the Shroud can do with my own eyes. If you value your safety, you'll not question me again. Take cover! Peter! Verity, no! Verity! Verity! Verity! Verity, are you okay? Pling! Oh! Oh! Hold tight. That was very close, Mr. Pling. You almost fell right over the edge. Oh. Now we're never going to get home. On the contrary, King Peter, I have been studying hieroglyphs for years. What I mean, Your Majesty, is that this was foretold. Being attacked and almost falling off a cliff was foretold? Y-- Yes, Your Majesty. Look! "A king with kin, who fell from height, with path below, all bathed in light, saw a city on the edge of night." That's a bit clever. How did the prophecy know we were gonna fall exactly here? That's what a prophecy does. It tells of things before they happen. That's how we knew you and King Peter would come. Pling, please. Enough with the prophecy talk. I'm not a king. Okay? Uh... He just gets like that sometimes when he doesn't know what to do. But don't worry, Mr. Pling. I've caught a think. A "think," Miss Verity? Yes. And a very good think too. You see, Peter does not know how to be king because he's afraid of everything. So I think that I shall be king. Well, queen, actually. I've had a lot of princessing experience. Oh... I've been a fairy princess, a forest princess, princess of whales. Well, dolphins, actually. I think I'm the perfect person for the job. I'm sorry, Miss Verity, but I'm afraid one cannot merely declare themselves royalty-- Well, that's very silly. Why not? Pling. Sire? Do you know how to get to the Luminere? Yes. Yes, of course. I majored in cartography. I know all the songs to all the places. Even the secret ones. I could possibly triangulate our location and find the appropriate verse to start from. Would this help? Oh! Oh, yes, sire! Um... Yes. North. Northwest. Perfect. No. Uh-- Uh, this way, sire. We start from the third verse. ♪ From landing's ledge To forest hedge ♪ ♪ Then it's slow descent To lowest edge ♪ Pling, you don't have to sing. Oh, it's no trouble, sire. It's my absolute pleasure. ♪ There's a rock with the spire All marked with fire ♪ ♪ And the fern with the glow Where the mushrooms grow ♪ Mr. Pling. I don't understand something. If Peter doesn't want to be king... then why can't I be king instead? Well, the law states a monarch may only be named through succession or challenge. They are the rules, Miss Verity. Well, that's very silly. My dad said that I could be anything I want if I just think outside a box. - A box? - Exactly. I've heard of the law of squares, Miss Verity, but I've never heard of the law of boxes. If I make it there in three seconds. If I make it to the tree in three. Okay. If I make it there in six seconds. Sire, may I inquire what that song you're singing is? It's-- It's nothing, Pling. Might you teach it to me? I-- Go away! We're here to see the Luminere. Hey, cut it out! I said, go away. We have to see the Luminere. The Luminere is far too busy and-- and important and clever, and-- No! I said, go away. We're here to see the Luminere. We were told he could help us. Impossible! I'm not here. You're the Luminere? - No. No, I'm not. I'm busy. - I said, go away. Wait, wait, come back. What do you want? To steal? To steal my idea? To steal for the Shroud? Hmm? No, of course not. We're not thieves. We're on an adventure. Pangolin Master Elwyn told us to come here. He said you could help us, and he gave me this. This cannot be! You're but a child. Hmm! Oh. You are not a king. That's what I've been telling everyone. Not a king yet. You do not see. Wait! Well, he wasn't much help. - Come. Come. - Much to learn, not much time. Okay, first we check eyes. Look my ear. Look, balloon. Yes? Good. Mmm. Okay, read first line. I-I don't understand. Wait. Wait. Ah. Now you read. Read what? Okay, we change. Now you see? Ah, yes, good. Now which one better? One? Two? Huh? One, I think, yes. Ah! One? Two? Better now? Yes? No? Which one better? Two, yes? No. Stop, please. Eye is fine. Boy is problem. Come, me fix. Book. Piece. Hmm? Yes. Look, Peter. It was hiding there the whole time. Each piece knows another's place. Hmm. "In forest deep, where many are one, where roots are tied and trunk undone, in space between the dark and light... a piece is hidden, in plain sight. Held in safety for a king, released by power held within." Well, that's a funny sort of rhyme. It's a riddle. To see, you must look. Look around you. Ha! I don't-- I don't see anything. Close mouth, open eyes. "Many are one." "Many are one." Hmm... "Roots are tied." This-- This isn't a forest. This is just one big tree. Ah! Now you start to see. Peter, do you see anything? Um, I'm not sure. Oh, wait, look there! I see it! I see it! I see it. Voilà! How do I get it? A king must arrive at his power. My power? How do I do that? Ah. Now, this is a question. Come, we find answer. Ah! Mmm. Lumen use power within to help problem, hmm? Close eyes. Ask it when I'm going to become queen. This not a game. Close eyes, concentrate. Power flow from quiet mind. Mmm. Yes. Mmm. Hmm? Mmm. You did not concentrate. Lumen done. Poof! Kaput! I can't. I just can't do it. Mmm... You have great fear. Great, great fear. Open mind. Let think flow. Try again. Hmm. Concentrate. Breathe slowly. Think slowly. Hmm. Concentrate. Think is flowing. Concentrate. Ooh la la. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I just can't. I can't do it. Enough sorry. Look, you do it already. Peter, you did it! Aha! Boy now working, mmm? "Where time is ten and two strokes end, a boy will find the age of men. Creatures blind, a count of three, a piece is hid where eyes must see. Kings head forth to find the piece, in times before where man fought beast." I believe it refers to an ancient arena, sire. A ruin from the time before. The song to here continues right by there. Well, that must be a very long song, Mr. Pling. Not too long, Miss Verity. If we skip the instrumental part, we can be there by morning. Find pieces, take to Citadel and fix clock before great eye close. Mmm. Okay, Pling, lead the way. Oh. Uh... ♪ From a garden good Hidden in the wood ♪ ♪ Moving in The right direct-- ♪ ♪ Perfection ♪ ♪ Perfection ♪ We've arrived, sire. What is it? It's a kind of sundial, an old way of telling the time. What time does it say? I'm afraid it's too early to tell. When the eye begins to close, the shadow will move about the dial and the time after will begin. "When time is ten and two strokes end." Twelve. Twelve. XII is 12. "A boy will find the age of men." What's the age of me? I'm nine, but the numbers are funny. X is ten and nine is one before ten. Therefore, you are IX. Here I am. One and X. "Boy will find the age of men." If two strokes end, then that'll make it 13. But that doesn't make sense. Thirteen? Clocks only go to 12. Excuse me, sire, if I may. Many cultures consider 13 to be the age of men. A time when childhood is left behind. You're right, Pling. There must be a number 13 around here somewhere. "Mark is scored with three. A stone is hidden where eyes must see." The 13! Yes! Finally. Okay. Okay, so, "Where eyes must see." "Eyes must see." Come on. What is it? "When eyes must see." The three blind mice. Okay. I got it! Peter! Verity! Quickly, Miss Verity. Peter! Verity! Okay. If I make it there in three seconds. If I make it there. Peter! If I make it there. I can make it there in three seconds. If I make it there in three seconds. Verity. Leave my sister alone! I am your king! You will yield! Please! Please, forgive me, Your Majesty. What are you crying about? You near frightened us to death. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to. I'm just so hungry. We are most definitely not food. I wa-- I wasn't going to eat you. Honest. I don't eat people. I'm an empath. I suppose you could say I eat my feelings. Probably how I got so big. Oh, the shame! I'm sorry, Your Majesty. I will accept any punishment you see fit. I deserve it. It's okay. You're not gonna be punished. Really? Really? Of course not. Oh! Your Majesty, thank you. Thank you. You are indeed a great and generous king. I am forever in your debt. What is your name? My name is Navitatis Immutatio Puerili Mendax. You've changed. It's true. I'm changed, reformed even. I promise I'll never scare another soul. No. He means your body has transformed. Oh, that. That happens with age, I'm afraid. Lost elasticity. I used to be able to change into anything, but these days, I'm more comfortable in larger, less fitted forms. You can change into anything? This creature does not appear anywhere in the prophecy, sire. I'm not sure we can trust it. But you can. I-I promise. Cross my heart. Please, sire, let me come with you. I can be quite useful. We could do with some transport. Oh, I can be very fleet-footed. This creature could be dangerous. Oh, I can fix that. Safety first. That's not what I meant. Where to, Your Highness? "East within the desert stands, a temple carved in mountain sands. Within the tomb beyond the hall, a clue is written on the wall. Amongst the glyphs with faces kin, a piece is hidden deep within." That looks to be the Temple of Limbus. To get there, we follow the "Song of the East." Starting from... Oh, uh, verse 138. There is no time to waste. ♪ A hollow log A tree that looks Just like a frog ♪ ♪ A cloven track, a hidden place A boulder that looks Like a face ♪ ♪ Forest green to lichen log Seven stones to mossy bog ♪ ♪ Ruins two and fro is three Set within a banyan tree ♪ ♪ Wall-less window Floorless door, a temple Stood that is no more ♪ What is it, Your Majesty? Are you okay, Pling? We are just going a little fast for me to keep pace with the lyrics. I'll be okay, sire. Uh, how about we take it line by line? Uh... What's our next target? Verse 187. Mossy rock to gravel patch. Your Majesty, if I sprint to each mark, we can save time. Good thinking, Mendax. I bet I can make it there in three seconds. Sorry, what did you say? Oh, it's nothing, Your Majesty. Um, just a game I play with myself sometimes. I pick a target and try to make it there. It's silly, really. Makes me feel better when I feel uneasy. You do that? I do that too! You do? Yeah. Okay, we leave on three. One, two, three. One, two, three. Yes! Oh! Okay. What's the next line? Uh, 200 paces right to the thatch. Okay, on three. One, two, three. One, two, three. This is the best adventure ever! It's not an adventure. It's a quest! Yes! Right, sire. I'm glad you agree, Pling. No, we need to go right. The Shroud army. It has been here before us. They are searching for the pieces. Looks like they failed. It's still on here. Your Majesty, how can you be sure the artifact is here? The compass is attracted to the hidden pieces. Your Majesty, I could do with a rest after the journey. Besides, small spaces make me feel rather uneasy. That's okay, Mendax. You stay here and keep watch. Thank you, Your Majesty. "East within the desert stands, a temple carved in mountain sands. Within a room beyond the hall, a clue is written on the wall." A place beyond the hall. It's just ruins. This is hopeless. We're never gonna find the next piece. Whoa! Did it see you? Who goes there? Show yourself. Shh. Maybe they'll go away. I'll go out. You stay. I said show yourself. I told you not to move. No, wait! Stop! Verity, wait! Hello, I'm Verity, and this is Peter. - And that ball over there is Pling. - Oh. They seem quite friendly. Not like foe. Come on out. I cannot know. Don't be afraid. We won't hurt you. I'm not coming out. There might be more. Oh, come on out, you curmudgeonly bore. This is a bad idea. Oh, my! Kneel, you dimwit! Did you not look? If a knee is took, I'll crick my crook. It's the king, you fool. Can't you see? Oh, my goodness. Your Majesty. Your Majesty. Please, you don't have to do that. But are you not the prophesized king? Well, of course he is. Look, he holds the thing. Yes, he is. But he still doesn't really believe it yet. Oh... A man of the people. True humility. A king, indeed, of great ability. I am Verity. Pleased to meet you. It's an honor indeed. You are truth itself, I must concede. You're both so funny. What are your names? I am Ego. And that is Ergo. We are humbled by your presence, Your Majesty. How may we be of service? Well, you can't unless you can tell me how to find the clue. Ah, yes, uh, the clue. The clue. Uh, it was on a wall. Ah, it sat right there just before the fall. What do you know about it? Ooh, there is much to know. We know a part. I shall tell it from the start. Hmm? ♪ Misery ♪ ♪ Misery ♪ Don't do the drama. Just tell them. He's doing the drama. Always with the drama. In temple deep by sea of night, beasts of two with wings of flight, when gazed upon with distant sight, reveal a code when turned to fight. Thank you. Thank you. Great. Another riddle. What does it even mean? Well, I interpret it to mean that there is a temple. On the edge of a sea as black as night. Possibly, but there is most definitely a temple involved. And in that temple, there are two magnificent creatures. What does that mean? Well, um, the king asked you a question. What does it mean? Well, I'm not quite sure. We haven't got time for this. Oh, I do apologize for him, Your Majesty. I see you are vexed. Never fear, sire. I'm working on the subtext. Peter, you are being very rude. They just want to help. Well, they're not. And I'm sorry, but we're running out of time, and we need to find the next puzzle piece. This is hopeless. You're being like you used to. I thought you were going to be brave. Why would you think that? I'm not brave. You go around telling everyone how afraid of everything I am. And I am. I agree. I'm terrified. Just because you're scared doesn't mean you're not brave. Look at all those things you've done, even though you were scared. What did I do, Verity? Tell me, what did I do? You came in after me when your bed fell into The Below. You jumped in when that thing attacked us in the cave and I went down the slippery slide. And you saved me when Mendax was being all scary, even though there were cracks everywhere. That's why you're being brave. You did all those things even though you were scared. Now, everyone gets scared, but not everyone does brave things. What should we do, sire? I don't know. I'm going outside to make Mendax into a proper unicorn. Do you think the unicorn was a metaphor? Her context seemed quite literal. Wait. Two winged beasts. Oh! Yes. Griffins. Are those the winged beasts you spoke of? I suppose they could be. Indeed, they should be. Pling, what do the symbols underneath read? I'm not sure. I've never seen symbols like this before. Tell me the clue again. In temple deep, on sea of night, beasts of two with wings of flight, when gazed upon with distant sight, reveal a code when turned to fight. "Gazed upon with distant sight." Distant sight. What am I missing? Uh, the chamber is quite small. I don't see how it is possible to see these from a distance. That's it! Distant sight. Pling, relax your eyes and look up at the wall. Look beyond the griffins. Do you see it? Oh, I see. Yes. Pling, tell me the symbols. Uh... Oh, uh... "M" with a tail. Two arcs with a cross. A squiggly something. A squiggly line or squiggle with a dot on top? A squiggle with a dot. Oh... Um, uh... A horseshoe with a line and a circle with a tail. Oh, yes! Yes! Yes! Peter! Verity! Miss Verity! She needs our help. I concur. That was her yelp. Peter! Let her go! I said let her go! The pieces to the great clock... ...you will give them to me. I don't know what you're talking about. I don't know. Where is the last artifact? I don't know! I don't know! I haven't found it yet! Attack! Miss Verity. Let go. Whoa! For glory! Or death! Oh, we missed out again. I told you so. We missed out because you're too slow. Yes! Yes, we did it! I shall write a song of this great battle, sire. Your deeds shall be sung far and wide. What are you talking about? You didn't even see it. Quiet, you philistine. Great art does not require witness. It feels funny. What? What is it? What's wrong? She doesn't have much time. Much time? What are you talking about? She's fine. Right? Right, Verity? It feels really funny, Peter. Pling, what do we do? You must find the final piece and get to the Citadel. Piece? No, we have to help her. We need to take her to someone. Mendax is correct, Peter. The prophecy states that the fallen will only be released when the great clock is restarted. Am I going to be a statue, Peter? I don't want to be a statue. Pling, this happens, right? This is part of the prophecy. I can't move my fingers. Yes, you can. Show me. I can't. No. Mendax, wings. We'll fly north. ♪ In Distant North Where ocean bounds ♪ ♪ A land alone Where sky meets ground ♪ Ah, this is the life. Sun on my face. Wind in my hair. Oh, what are you talking about? You don't have any hair. Ugh, you're ruining the moment. Smell that air. I don't like this. Oh, try living with him. I mean flying. Upon thy wing a king doth ride, a perilous flight to mountain spied. Can you stop that? "Peril" is not a word one wants to hear at great heights. Statistically speaking, flying is the safest form of transport. M-Miss Verity. Peter, she must not sleep. Verity, wake up. I'm really tired. Verity, you have to stay awake. Peter, your compass. "Where sky meets ground." The mountain, that's it! I see it, Your Majesty. Come on, Mendax. Everyone, hold tight. This place looks familiar. I feel we've been here before. Don't you? Absolutely, I concur. Déjà vu. - Peter. - Don't speak. Verity, we're here. There's another piece here. I'm so tired, Peter. I'm just gonna have a rest. No, you can't do that. You have to stay awake just a little bit longer. But I can't feel my feet. Peter, you have to remember. Remember what? You have to remember me. No, no. Verity, just stay awake. Look, I'll be right back. Verity? Verity, wake up. Mendax, stay with her. Keep watch. Of course, Your Majesty. We'll stay too. She shall not sleep. There will be no counting of the sheep. Your Majesty, there is something I must tell you, but I can't recall. Alas, we've hit a wall. Whatever it is, it has to wait. Come on, Pling. What do I do? I'm not sure. Oh... Ah. Something just happened. Oh, okay. I get it now. It's just a game of memory. We have to match the symbols. Whoa! Peter! Pling, are you okay? It seems there may be consequences to losing. I think you might be right. Peter. Come on, come on, come on, come on. Yeah. Yes! I've got this. I've got this. Oh! Whoa! Peter. Pling, tell me the part of the prophecy that says we don't die here. Oh, well, in the prophecy, the king makes it all the way to the Citadel. Then there's nothing to be afraid of, right? Mmm... Uh... Um... Well... ...it's just that many of the events that have occurred on our journey are not in the prophecy. Wait, so what do you mean? The-- The book and the pieces and... Wait, if this isn't part of the prophecy, then that means I'm not the chosen king. I knew it! I knew it. I mean, then why are you still here? I mean, why? Why are you here with me, risking your life, when you know that I'm not the king? Because you are my friend, and... and I believe in you. Hmm. There are two possible combinations left. You can do this. Oh, please, please, please. Yes! Yes, yes! Yes! We did it! You did it, Peter. Oh... How did you do? It wasn't there. Is it possible you may have missed it? What are you doing? Back up, you oaf. Mendax, move now. Very well. Peter. Verity. Verity, I'm here. You have to see now. Peter, you have to see. See? What do I have to see? Verity! Verity! Verity! Verity! No! A king, he stands with trouble on high, with heavy heart and teary eye, but to save the truth, he again must fly. Stop it. Read your audience. This is no time for your dramatics. It's the requiem, my favorite of all the prophetic prose. The next part is really rather lovely. Cathartic, actually. Oh, yes! Oh! That's right! I remember now. This is the part where he throws the book. Exactly. The book! The book! Your Majesty! Your Majesty! Your Majesty! Your Majesty! Oh. Oh, no. A beautiful moment. The death of certainty. And at the same time, rebirth. Oh! Hurry. We must tell him the rest. The rest of what? Don't go that way. It's too high. - This way's quicker. - Ow! Oh, my! I think we broke something. We? You! You broke something. Get your hand out of my face. You okay? The missing piece. Ah! That's where we put it. Oh... You had it all along? I'm sorry, Your Majesty. That's what I was trying to recall. I didn't know it was there at all. You seem to have dropped this, Your Majesty. The final part. "In the Citadel awaits, a final test, a shrouded fate, only the face of truth within." What is it, Peter? "Only the face of truth within can release a fallen king. In the presence of the clock, puzzle complete will unlock, but only in a king's domain, shall the key within be gained. With tiny key and bravest heart, time when wound again will start." Oh... The prophecy says that when the great clock is restored, the fallen will be released. Mendax, we're going to the Citadel. Very well, Your Majesty. We shall stay and watch over her. Besides, we're not really dressed for the Citadel. Where to now? We are in the Treasury Square. The tower is located just ahead. Yes. Yes, that is correct. It was here that the great battle for The Below was fought. You seem to know a lot about this place. Oh, I've heard the stories. Your kinfolk fought most gallantly, young Pling. Although, in the end, their sacrifice was rather... unnecessary. - The gauntlet! - Indeed. The gauntlet? What gauntlet? Armored sentinels that guard the tower. They are impenetrable. And you wait until now to tell me this? I only just remembered. Not even the Shroud himself was able to defeat them. Only a true king will be permitted to pass. Then this is about to be over real quick. Come, Your Majesty. We've made it this far. Halt! Who goes there? My lords, I present to you Peter, King of The Below. Eyes. Hmm... Interesting. What is it? I believe it's a child. A mild what? No, I said a child. I am Peter. Ears. Yes, sir. Here, sir. What is he saying? It's a child, sir. I said, I am Peter. I have come to-- A child, you say? We're running out of time. I command you to let us pass. Let us through, you oafs. Oh! Shh, shh, shh. Forgive us. What was that last part again? I-- I command you to let us pass. Oh, he's thrown down the gauntlet. You gotta hand it to him. He must have some big hands. You know what they say-- Big hands, big glass. Big glass. The prophecy must be fulfilled. Mendax. That beast has no power here. Get ahold of yourselves. You are in the presence of-- Only the king shall pass. Well, I am that king. Boss... A false claim of kinghood is punishable by death. If you are the king, you will prove your power, or you will be destroyed. Well, how do I prove my power? A king does not ask how. Oh... Then I-- I-- I challenge you to a game. What sort of game? A game of... Oh... ...rock, paper, scissors. Challenge accepted. Oh. Three rounds. Best of three. If you win, you shall pass. If you do not, you shall perish. Okay. We throw on three. Acceptable. One. Two. Three. He's gone scissors. We saw that one coming. Blind Freddy could see that one coming. No, I couldn't. That is one point, us. Oh... One. Two. Three. That is two points, us. But scissors beats paper. Two points, us. That's cheating. All decisions are final. You have one turn left. Maybe don't go scissors again. One. Hurry up, child. Stop stalling. One. Two. Three. What is that? It's dynamite. Dynamite? He's cheating. Fall in. Attack. Oh, my goodness. "In the presence of a clock, puzzle complete will unlock, but only in a king's domain, shall the key within be gained. With tiny key and bravest heart, time when wound again will start." Almost there. I-I don't understand. Why isn't it working? You've come this far, Peter. Maybe-- Maybe I just have to think outside the box. There's that peculiar saying again. I'm still not sure I understand it. It means to see something differently, to find a new solution. Uh, Pling, do you know what a king's domain is? Uh, I'm not sure I understand the question. A king's domain... is a castle. Oh, my! That is how you think outside the box. Pling-- Pling. Well done, Your Majesty. Mendax? What have you done? Fear is such a powerful emotion. It can literally make you freeze. What are you? I am the sands of time. I am the chains that bind. I am everything you do not see. I am what you make of me. You're the Shroud! Yes. You are indeed a wise little king. You lied to me! I thought you were my friend! You used me! You used me to get the pieces and to find the key! And still you do not see. Why have you done this? You did this, Peter. You made me. I am your fear. But I could be so much more. For I can become anger. I can become rage. I know what pains you, Peter. I know what you keep buried below. Show yourself! What form shall I take? Show yourself, you coward! Coward? If I show myself in three seconds, nothing bad will happen, right? I command you to show yourself! Will I? Won't I? What does the prophecy say? What happens next? Looking for something? Watch out for the cracks, Peter. With each panicked breath, each frenzied heartbeat, I grow stronger. Let me be more. Let me free of this Below and let me be all you need me to be. What do you see, Peter? Verity! Wait! It's magic. It's only been a year, and I'm still dealing with this. This family loses too much. Verity! No! So now you see. The clock will never be restored. The time before is over. Only I can give you the control you crave. You need me. I control you. I own you. Not anymore. I own me. It's over, Pling. Oh, my. It's done. It is as the prophecy foretold. I told you we were underdressed. You said a tire was suitable. No, I said we needed suitable attire. Hello. Hello. Verity! I'm proud of you. You did the brave thing. You saw what you needed to see. Does this mean I get to be queen now, Mr. Pling? Yes, Miss Verity. You have to let me go now, Peter. Yeah, mate, we're gonna have this room fixed up before you know it. Did you do-- I guess the light got in. Dad, close your eyes and tell me what you see. Okay, so, it was crazy. Um, I was sitting on the bed, just in the middle of the night, and suddenly, it fell down straight through. Uh... Oh, oh, oh. Uh--
