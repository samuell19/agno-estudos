Convergence of 3 Yin forces Up in the sky, like the sun at high noon Starting today, I go into isolation to practice I shall challenge Wudang's Silkworm Skill in 2 years In my absence, the 8 division leaders will take over Yes! You are excused Yes! "Endurance" The 2 kung fu masters in China Dugu Wu Di of the Invincible Clan And Yun Fei Yang of Wudang Dugu's Fatal Skill is sinister and ruthless He has been invincible Soon after Yun Fei Yang started out he had already mastered Silkworm Skill And made a name for himself Who is the better of the two? It seems like Fatal Skill has repeatedly been defeated by Silkworm Skill That's why Dugu has been practising Allegedly, he's at the 9th level It's hard to say who'll win Regardless of their power they cannot stop me from invading China I want them to know Ega clan martial arts is the best Yes! Brother, your Phantom Skill How is it coming along? Take the prisoners here I'll demonstrate for you Phantom Skill Spare me! Help! Take care of this Chinese coward Your Phantom Skill is incredible It controls the opponent's heartbeat! I bet there's no match for you This is just a glimpse of it Your Phantom Skill can be more powerful than this? When it's time to go up against Dugu Wu Di and Yun Fei Yang ...you'll know When do we leave? I relish the pain on their faces Make preparations We'll leave as soon as you're ready Yes! Up in the sky, like the sun at high noon Welcome back, Master Have a seat! I have good news 2 years in isolation I have advanced my Fatal Skill to the 10th level Congratulations! In my absence You have all shown me great support I will reward you accordingly Thank you, Master During this period... any particular news? Sir! It was peace and quiet everywhere Except Wudang Sir! What is it? The new leader Fu Yu Xue is the descendent of Tian Di from Xiao Yao Valley He concocted a trap and killed Yen Zhong Tian He has mastered Silkworm Skill Fu Yu Xue can't kill him Yen's Silkworm Skill comes and goes Fu took a chance and ambushed Yen I've trained hard to counter his Silkworm Skill Now... all has gone to waste! Not quite, Master Why? Yun Fei Yang has also learned Silkworm Skill He killed Fu Yu Xue and revived Wudang Nonsense! I have already wasted him How can he master Silkworm Skill? According to my information The key to Silkworm Skill is to destroy and then revive He had help from Madam and the young mistress and Lun Wan Er They have funnelled their Yin force into his body Helped him attain the highest level Yun Fei Yang He has profited from adversity He's a thorn in our flesh that must be removed Our ancestors have always been defeated by Silkworm Skill This time I must go to Wudang Kill Yun Fei Yang and avenge this insult "Wudang" Intruders! Dugu Wu Di! Master Dugu, if you wish to visit Wudang Please ask your men to disarm This is Wudang's rule Since the days of our founder, Chang San Feng No one dared to disobey Dugu Wu Di? You burst into Wudang and destroyed our property What do you want? Have you forgotten the duel we set 2 years ago? We have proper ways of doing things You still cannot break in here like this Since you don't go by the rule We need not show mercy Stop! Let's discuss this... You've come to pay us a visit I apologize for not welcoming you Please forgive us! May I ask the purpose of your visit? Yes! Tell Yun Fei Yang to come out Yun Fei Yang? Our Master has attained the 10th level of Fatal Skill We're here for a duel! Go get him! Is he too scared to come out? Is he in hiding? It's not that Wudang's Silkworm Skill is afraid of your Fatal Skill But Yun Fei Yang has left Wudang Please come again in 7 days Yes, come back in 7 days! Very well! I will be back If Yun Fei Yang is not here by then I'll slaughter everyone in Wudang! But... During the next 7 days No one is allowed to leave Or else they'll be killed on sight! "Wudang Grand Hall" What shall we do? What can we do? Do you have a plan? It's all your fault! I... How can you blame him? If Brother Xie didn't react quickly Dugu would not have left We would have gone to see our ancestors! You should have stalled him for more than 7 days Under the circumstances I hardly had time to think Now you have 7 days to locate Yun Fei Yang Yes, go find him! But Yun Fei Yang and Lun Wan Er have disappeared Where can I find them? You'll have to search high and low and take your chances What if we can't find him And Dugu returns... We're no match for his Fatal Skill Masters Shaolin, Huashan, Kunlun, Emei and Diancang these 5 sects have been discontented with Dugu Wu Di None of them dared to confront him alone If we invite them here I believe they will come Absolutely! Good plan! Let's do that! Yao Feng, you're smart I'm charging you with locating Yun Fei Yang Yes, sir! Yun Fei Yang... Bastard! Who are you calling a bastard? Sorry! Not you! He's the bastard! You're not him! What? He said... Sorry, I've made a mistake! He made a mistake! Yes! What did he say about me? You're handsome and majestic, like a hero! That's too kind! Yes, a hero! Please sit down! Thank you He's the last person you should cross! He's the local bully It's a long story I'm looking for a friend But I can't find him And I mistook him for someone else Who are you looking for? Yun... he's a wanderer Don't know where to find him! Wanderers are hard to find I have a plan Yes? Go to the Fortune Teller He can help you Fortune Teller? Who's he? His name is Li Bu Yi He has a mole on his forehead His signboard reads "Fortune Teller" He is extremely efficacious Takes forever to tell you what he can do That's right! Really?

What kind of a Fortune Teller is he? I've begged him and he won't help me! Alright, since you're a filial son I'll help you and do a good deed for myself Thank you How old is he? Pick a word Fortune Why this word? What's wrong? This word appears to be good fortune But in fact bad luck is hidden within It has 3 evil omens! Firstly, sickness comes under "Earth" Earth is dominating on top Secondly, the patient is 49 years old The shape of the word is less than 50 Lastly, it's not Xin I'm afraid he won't live past the month of Xin Master, please don't scare me Why would I do that? I'll die early for letting out a secret Master Sir... What is it? The old master just died So soon? Today is the last day of the month of Xin I was right! Master, you're incredible!

Unfortunately, 9 clear and 1 milky What? Your scar has severed your brow Proves that you're illiterate and a loafer and you rat on others Nonsense!

Please wait up! I have already saved your life What do you want with me? My life is nothing There are many other lives waiting to be saved Really? Yes! I'm a Wudang pupil I must find someone in 3 days To deal with Dugu Wu Di Otherwise, Wudang will be finished! Who are you looking for? Yun Fei Yang You should have told me earlier! You know him? We've met briefly He's with Lun Wan Er Living in seclusion Please take me to him Even if you find him It'll take 5 days back and forth You won't get back to Wudang in time What should I do? Dugu will return to Wudang in 3 days! You're the Fortune Teller What's the fate of Wudang? Write a word and I'll analyse it Analyse "wu" for me Bad news! What is it? Break up "wu" No more generation, the sect stops here What does that mean? Extermination Extermination? Leaders of the 5 sects have arrived This way please You have come from afar I apologize for not welcoming you properly With your generous help Wudang will be safe Don't mention it I've been friends with the late Master Qing Song I cannot stand idly by Huashan and Wudang share a common lot We cannot rest if you're in trouble The Invincible Clan has been bullying us Shaolin can bear no more of their doings Actually... Dugu Wu Di killed my master He has long been Diancang's enemy Yes! Dugu Wu Di is not only Wudang's enemy but our common enemy This will be a perfect opportunity for us to come together against them Excellent... Since we're on the same side Let's discuss how to deal with him Very well! You Japanese What are you doing here? The 4 of you Why did you kill Wudang's pupils? Tell Yun Fei Yang to come out Yun Fei Yang again? Did Dugu Wu Di send you? Don't talk to him Move! Master, we have trouble! What happened? 4 Japanese are outside They have killed our pupils They are looking for Yun Fei Yang It's them! Calm down! What do you want? Yun Fei Yang! You're Dugu Wu Di's running dogs! Who's Dugu Wu Di? We're from the Ega Clan in Japan What do you want with Yun Fei Yang? Do you bear him a grudge? No! We're here to tell you Chinese one thing What is it? Wudang's Silkworm Skill and Dugu Wu Di's Fatal Skill are nothing Only Ega Clan's martial arts is truly invincible You're here to pick a fight Yun Fei Yang is not here Don't be disappointed If you're looking for a contest The 5 sects will show you Very well! Come on! Let me go first! We're back Did you find Yun Fei Yang? He's not there But it was not a wasted trip We have killed everyone in Wudang Chinese kung fu is terrible! Even if Yun Fei Yang were there You need not have bothered Sanshiro, it's not that simple You haven't met a true master Now that we can't find Yun Fei Yang What should we do next? So be it We'll frame the Invincible Clan for the murders Yun Fei Yang will take revenge Let them destroy each other Yes! Brother Xie! Master Cang Song! Master Chi Song! It must be Dugu Wu Di! Why are you so sure? Because that's what he said he'll do Only he can kill the leaders of the 5 sects! Who else? Whether or not he did this we must find Yun Fei Yang at once! Strange! The Dipper is gone? The Dipper is not gone It's just behind the clouds For some reason, I don't feel right I have a feeling something will happen to Wudang You must have been away for too long You miss your brothers Let's go visit them some day A big one! Almost a catty! Let's make congee! Who's making it? You! Me again? I fish, you cook! Smells good! Wan Er, I want to go back to Wudang But I'm afraid they'll make me stay And we can't live in peace again You can't help being in this position I would love to be here with you and live in seclusion It won't be easy Dugu Wu Di, I will come after you! Yun Fei Yang, what do you think? I must challenge Dugu Wu Di And avenge Wudang I'll go with you! Fei Yang, there's no hurry! Why? You don't look very well. You should be careful I'm not a coward I am indebted to Wudang and they died because of me I must challenge Dugu Wu Di to a duel for exterminating Wudang That is ruthless and callous He will die an awful death! Panther Leader Yes, sir! You told me everything was peace and quiet How can someone kill all the Wudang pupils and the leaders of the 5 sects overnight? In my opinion The killer is not from China Who is it then? I don't know Which one of you can tell me? Moron! Useless! Master, I've arrested someone who made slanderous allegations against you What should I do with them? Bring them here! Move! Kneel down! Who told you to spread rumours and allegations against me? Speak up! We don't know anything! Even if we do, we won't tell! Speak up! You hear me? Talk! Master, they're dead! Shut up! I know that! Yun Fei Yang charged into Tiger Division What should we do? Yun Fei Yang Go to Tiger Division "Tiger Division" "Yun Fei Yang" You'll pay for this! "Dragon Division" Listen up! Don't let him get away! Yun Fei Yang, you got away last time You won't get away again! Charge! Stop! Who are you? He's Yun Fei Yang! Nonsense! He's an imposter! Where are you from? No comment Why did you pose as Yun Fei Yang? And go against the Invincible Clan? No comment The Ega Clan? Do you know Mochitsuki Soryu Han? He's my brother Why set yourself against the Invincible Clan? We're setting against all of you Then tell me this Wudang and leaders of the 5 sects Did you kill them? Yes! Your Invincible Clan will be next Master... Yun Fei Yang has sent a letter of challenge Sanshiro posed as Yun Fei Yang He was found out and killed by Dugu Wu Di! Nonsense! Your disguise is magnificent! How can you be so happy? Too bad Sanshiro is dead! Dugu Wu Di Yun Fei Yang has arranged with Dugu Wu Di for a duel at Death Valley Let's take this chance and avenge Sanshiro No! If we expose ourselves they'll join forces against us Ambush them nearby Play it by the ear "Death Valley" Nice to see you again, Yun Fei Yang! This is not a happy occasion for me! I heard you have attained the 10th level Yes! That's why you started a blood bath at Wudang and killed the leaders of the 5 sects? I'm a man of noble stature I win people over with my kung fu Those people are not worth my trouble Your atrocities are well known How can you deny it? Let me show you something Who is he? He's from the Ega Clan He serves Mochitsuki Soryu Han Japanese? Yes! About the bloodbath in Wudang the Ega Clan is responsible How did you know? He posed as Yun Fei Yang Broke into our Tiger and Dragon Divisions Such a dirty trick! Why didn't you go after them? I will, as soon as my Fatal Skill defeats your Silkworm Skill I'll go seek them out While I'm at it I'll avenge the extermination of Wudang for you Your Fatal Skill has always been defeated by Silkworm Skill This is no exception! You're wrong! We'll set a precedent today This is between me and him All of you leave the valley at once! Yes! Let's begin now Master Dugu If you have nothing to do with exterminating Wudang let me seek out Mochitsuki first No! We must fight today! We must have a winner today Very well! Let's begin Be careful, Fei Yang! Fei Yang! Fei Yang! Are you alright? Let me! Are you alright, Fei Yang? Li Bu Yi? Take him to the seaside Leave this to me! You've been hit by the 12th chip It's a bad luck chip Li Bai dredging the moon Nothing but a mirage Infinite clear sky Interrupted by a gust of wind Turning into a wisp of smoke I don't know what it all means! It means everything you see now is nothing but an illusion It looks good but it's not real I suggest you go easy on people It'll do yourself some good Nonsense! Coughing? You must be ill! You should not lose your temper if you're ill! I must slap you for cursing me Sorry! Got your hand dirty! Wait! The tail end of your marriage line is crooked You're destined to have no wife or children Nonsense! There's an island shape on your lifeline It means you're impotent and something's wrong with your heart You're lying! Your breathing is irregular Blocking your vital energy Let me show you something else "Till we meet again" Sister What happened? It's a long story Why are you here? Li Bu Yi knew of this pre-destined fate and told me to wait for him here Where's Li Bu Yi? Fighting off Dugu at Death Valley Let's get on the boat Be careful! I know You won't get away! If Dugu can't kill Yun Fei Yang Let us have the pleasure Who are you? We're from the Ega Clan So it's you... They killed everyone at Wudang Brother Brother Brother Everything is pre-destined Don't be too sad The important thing is to find a doctor to cure Yun Fei Yang He's been hit by Fatal Skill an ordinary doctor may not cure him Let's go find the Legendary Doctor Lai Yao Er Tell me, am I invincible? You are a kung fu master The Invincible Clan is dominating Up in the sky, like the sun at high noon Up in the sky, like the sun at high noon Together... Up in the sky, like the sun at high noon... Louder... Up in the sky, like the sun at high noon... Shut up! Invincible? Am I invincible? If I am How can Li Bu Yi and Yun Fei Yang slip through my fingers? Liars! You're all lying to me! You've all been lying! Master... The tail end of your marriage line is crooked You're destined to have no wife or children There's an island shape on your lifeline and something's wrong with your heart Li Bu Yi is right Master, please calm down!

Master, he wants you to go meet him ...or else he'll leave Where is he now? At the pavilion Lan Xin Zu, you're becoming arrogant It's a matter of reputation Anyone who's on your beckon call is not worth the money! Cut the small talk! Check my pulse! Damn! You have a strong pulse But you're gravely ill Nonsense! I feel fine! Fine? Then you're hopeless What are you saying? You have over exerted yourself and have become addicted You're ill-tempered and have overworked yourself Medication can only relieve your symptoms The rest is up to you Up to me? Simple! Don't be too excited Stay calm and you'll live longer Why are you spitting blood? You get excited too easily I'll prescribe something for you now How much longer to Doctor Lai? 3 more days' journey 13 pieces... 13 is unlucky! What did you say? It's not safe here. Let's go! This disaster we're facing when will it end? Judging from your looks It's a long hard journey Grave danger lies ahead You're amazing! You manage to find us no matter where we are! But your face tells me you're destined to die away from home Don't worry about me Even if I die my brothers will come after you! If it hadn't been for you Fei Yang would have died Sorry! I forgot to mention This is just a false alarm Danger still lies ahead We may not be so lucky next time Fei Yang can only go forward We must hurry or else he'll die Be careful! Watch over Fei Yang! Damn! Monjiro Noguchi Goro Are your eyes better? We have suffered repeated setbacks Healing eyes will not bring me joy We can't even beat a fortune teller Such a disgrace! Shall we commit hara-kiri? Damn! If you're dead... I'll be stranded here by myself That's too lonely! The tradition of Ega Clan is to endure We'll endure it all Wait for your eyes to heal Then I'll personally take revenge Is Doctor Lai at home? You're looking for Papa? Yes! Have you seen Papa today? Only yesterday. Don't know where he is now! They are Doctor Lai's children? Didn't you hear them calling him Papa? How old is Doctor Lai? You'll find out soon! You want him for someone's diagnosis? Yes! Go over there and ask for directions! Thank you! Come! Is Doctor Lai here? What? Is Doctor Lai around? You're looking for Papa? Yes! Are they... What did she say? Where is Papa? Have you seen Papa? Who's looking for Papa? Do you still remember me? You're the fortune teller who said I'll live to 80 How old are you now? I'll be 80 in 2 days You want to bring him to see Papa? Yes! He's very sick Such a shame to die so young! Is Doctor Lai around? Yes! Take them! We're here! Hurry! Charlatan, your old friend is here! Give us a warm welcome! Fortune Teller, you come all the way out here You must bring me trouble You think I have nothing better to do than growing flowers and vegetables? He's Lai Yao Er? Everyone here at this village regardless of age and sex calls him Papa Go ask him yourself! Papa! My husband's life is in danger Please save him! He's wounded from a fight? Say no more If you won't help him, he'll die I have rules about my patients I won't cure anyone who knows kung fu Why? I cure them, they'll go killing each other again Find someone else Papa, please have a heart! You can't just let him die! I won't break my rules and set precedents Papa... Papa, please! If you save him I'll do anything for you! What shall we do now? Don't worry! I have a plan to make him cure Yun Fei Yang Listen, you quack doctor You won't lift a finger to help save a life You're worst than a beast Heartless, conceited and conservative You have no sense of value No judgement You're an unfeeling, shameless idiot A selfish coward You're pretentious and prejudiced You're scum of the literati Selfish hypocrite You have no heart, no feelings You're not worthy to be a doctor You ought to be running a funeral home instead Nicely put! My late father deserves this even more! His father ran a funeral home I've seen too many dead people So I decided to become a doctor He wanted them dead while I want them alive We finally had a fall-out He was my father I dare not defy his wishes This is simple What she just said Use that on your father Consider her doing you a favour Yes! All my anger, frustrations and bitterness have been relieved You must thank her I'll make an exception and cure him Thank you! Bring him in here, hurry! How is he? Don't ask! Get me some water! Charlatan, how is he? Will he make it? You must be mistaken! He doesn't look like he'll die young Are you mistaken? Or was it me? We're both correct His main artery has been shattered What can we do? We need a 1000-year ginseng and lucid ganoderma in order we can save him Where can we find that? I have lucid ganoderma But Ghost Doctor has the ginseng Damn! Papa... Put it down... slowly! "Help!" What's the meaning of this coffin? Are you Papa? We have a patient He's dying, please save him! Please! Or else we'll have to bury him alive! Yes, bury him alive! Let me see Please save him! Mission failed! Retreat! Charge! Help me! Who are you! Speak up! We're the Chaiwan Canons I'm Wuyanpao Mahoupao Chedapao Why did you ambush me? Our master ordered us! Who is your master? And why? Ghost Doctor Lan Xin Zu You're his competitor He knows about your lucid ganoderma and wants it for himself So he sent us here to kill you Kill me? Charlatan If the Ghost Doctor is after your lucid ganoderma Don't be modest! Very well! You take care of Yun Fei Yang I'll go see the Ghost Doctor Last year at the Lantern Festival I had a date at dusk This year the lanterns remain unchanged Young master, move aside! What are you doing? We've been defeated Defeated? Your father Lan Xin Zu wanted my lucid ganoderma Doctor Lai Tell your father to come out You'll have to get past me first Don't! He's quite capable! Shut up! What do you have in mind? Match my couplet Go ahead! My father is a medical master I'm the son of the master Master father master son, father and son masters I fill prescriptions I'll use Chinese herbs to match your couplet Danggui father, danggui son, father and son danggui What? You called us turtles! Where are your manners? Father, show him! Doctor Lai and I are of the same trade We should serve him wine No thanks! I'm here to borrow something I know, you want my ginseng to save Yun Fei Yang If you drink these bowls of wine You may have it These 3 bowls of wine are poisoned The green one makes you dizzy The red one makes you bleed from the 7 apertures The black one corrodes your organs I dare you to drink them Otherwise You'll never get the 1000-year ginseng How about it? I'm doing this to save a friend I apologize You've drunk the wine You think you can leave? Thanks Papa! He's back! What happened? Did you get the ginseng? Yun Fei Yang is lucky If you don't get the ginseng You'll wreck my name! Cut the small talk! Papa, please save my husband now! Not here! Why? The ginseng and lucid ganoderma must be boiled with water from the Frigid Pond If we get water from there we'll waste precious time Besides, your enemies may come after him It is not safe here What shall we do? Let's go the Frigid Pond right away! "Frigid Pond" Papa, it's so cold in here Fei Yang may not be able to bear it Don't worry, he'll be alright! I've studied his face He is pre-destined to go through 2 near-death disasters before he's resurrected Don't be so sure! It all depends on the medication! We have the medication and we're at the Frigid Pond How can you still not be sure? What do you know? The herbs are strong and fierce Must use the supple cold water To achieve equal balance Not very many people can withstand its effect Look... Fei Yang Water... Fei Yang Fei Yang You can't drink that! Water... Come back! I want water! Papa, why can't he drink water? The medicine is acting up, his temperature is rising If he drinks this icy water the different temperature may harm his organs What are you doing? Closing up his Baihui pressure point Monitor him after the effect of the medication subsides Look! The Reincarnation Rock! You're sure this is it? Yes! Look! Nothing is growing around the cold rock except for that tree This must be the Reincarnation Rock Does that mean Fei Yang will be alright? Yes! The rock draws powers from the sun and the moon Its essence is only radiated during full moon This is a chance of a lifetime Yun Fei Yang is destined to live Look! Who are you? Japanese! If I'm not mistaken You must be Mochitsuki Soryu Han Have I frightened you, Dugu Wu Di? You've repeatedly murdered people and framed me for it. We must settle the score Very well! I'm here to challenge you So you know that the Ega Clan is invincible These Japanese are too cocky Let me teach them a lesson You're most welcome Better all come at once Go on! Charge! Stop! We cannot let foreigners look down on us Step down! Yes! Lan Xin Zu, why are you still here? I will not miss this Sino-Japanese match up! Please be careful. You have just recovered Don't over exert yourself Cut the small talk! Mochitsuki, after you! After you! Dugu Wu Di, you're quite amazing! Don't interfere! Take your medication! Well? Are you alright? What is that? It's called Phantom Skill It's the killer heartbeat Please take care, master! Master... Up in the sky, like the sun at high noon... Up in the sky, like the sun at high noon Look! Fei Yang Wan Er What happened? Dugu Wu Di has wounded you The Fortune Teller and Papa saved you! Papa? Who's Papa? Fei Yang, this is Papa! The famous Legendary Doctor Lai Yao Er Don't mention it... I will never forget your kindness Don't be modest, it's your own good fortune Let's discuss how to go deal with Mochitsuki You'll need our help! Lan Xin Zu, you're here for your ginseng? Don't worry That's nothing compared to national pride What do you mean? We must not be humiliated by the Japanese! Mochitsuki killed Dugu Wu Di He's dead? Mochitsuki is too arrogant He claims that no one is his match We're here to help Yun Fei Yang to defend our reputation Thank you. I'm fine now Lan Xin Zu, it's so unlike you! Because I'm Chinese too Yun Fei Yang Mochitsuki's Phantom Skill is deadly Don't underestimate him Phantom Skill? He kills by controlling the opponent's heartbeat That makes him invincible! Not necessarily All kung fu has its weakness! It's a matter of finding and breaking it I believe Phantom Skill uses sound waves to control heartbeats To counter attack we must use another sound to contain it Wan Er, wait for me at home I'll look for Mochitsuki Fei Yang He looks magnificent today Don't worry! Attention Mochitsuki of Ega Clan You have exterminated Wudang Killed the leaders of the 5 sects I challenge you at Wudang Shan on September 9th Yun Fei Yang "Wudang Grand Hall" You think he'll show up? His objective is to kill you and Dugu Wu Di He'll come if he knows you're still alive! You have extremely good fortune Narrowly escaping death every time Haven't you heard of a Chinese proverb? Good fortune after a near-death disaster Japanese warriors don't believe in luck Victory solely depends on one's ability Chinese kung fu values being open and aboveboard Unlike Japanese who are ruthless and unscrupulous The spirit of Bushido is to defeat your opponent You lose because you're not good enough People in Wudang were defeated What can you say for yourself? Nothing is absolute, you may not win I have defeated Dugu Wu Di Who else can match me? I would like to give it a try Very well! You can't handle my blade empty-handed Find yourself a weapon! How dare you humiliate me with a drumstick? At the highest level of Chinese kung fu anything can be used as a weapon Help! What are you doing? Come back! What's with you and Doctor Lai? It's dangerous up there! Ninjas! Phantom Skill Fei Yang, all yours! You foresee with such divine precision! I've cracked your Phantom Skill Incredible! Are you alright? I'm fine! I've broken all your drums What else can you do? He's formidable! We'll play by the ear Killer Heartbeat Regulate your breathing Catch! Damn! Yun Fei Yang, use Silkworm Skill!
