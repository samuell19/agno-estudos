Oh, Catarina! CATARINA!! CATARINA!! Oh, Catarina! Oh! Catarina! Catarina... My poor daughter... If you only knew how I frightened I was.. Frightened for your future... You were born of a great passion... And I who live in the past... in a country that no longer exists... with a passion that no longer exists... The People United will Not Be Defeated! The Workers Will Overcome! The Workers Will Overcome! Death to the political police! Death to Fascism! Death to Imperialism! Stop demeaning unwed mothers! And you, Catarina... You, who are about to step into this New World... What's going to happen to you? How can I save you, if I can't even save myself? Anyway, whoever wants to save themselves will lose themselves... Good morning, Portugal. The Fatherland rules our hearts. Security in Peace. Good morning, dear citizens and your respective families. The rays of Peace are starting to penetrate the dark and terrible mantle of the infamous and cowardly curse of terrorism. Dear citizens: Our Family Conversations become ever more indispensable in creating a bond of affection between our Government and our beloved Portuguese people. Needless to say, it's absolutely mandatory to tune in to our channel according to the law approved by an overwhelming majority in our highly distinguished National Assembly. The Fatherland rules our Hearts! Long live Portugal! Long live a United Portugal! Good morning, Portugal. We're finally making progress towards the greatly desired Security in Peace. Raymond... Long live Portugal! Raymond... Dissidence is Treason! Long live Nuclear Portugal! We're all waiting for you... Security in Peace! Long Live Portugal! I'm ready, Papa! Thank you Andreia. Shall we go? Raymond, only you would let the car break down on a day like this! Now that I'm promoted, Damião promises me a Gold Visa card That's super, mom! When can we go shopping? ♪ Here Comes the Bride ♪ Damião... Damião... Behind his exterior I see only self-love, selfishness... and greed for money. But, Catarina is a saint, sacrificed here in marriage... Everyone told you that I agreed to you marrying Damião... and they insisted this was the only way to give you freedom of choice. But, I knew full well what was going on. The constant pressure that's been put on you... suffocating you. But, I was so afraid... that one day I'd see you poor and miserable... that one day I'd think marrying into riches would have been the lesser misfortune. It was in this anguish... of not knowing which path to choose that I let things get to this state... My Catarina... my daughter. Catarina, will you take Damião to be your husband and promise to be faithful, to love and to respect him in joy and in sorrow, in sickness and in health all the days of your life? Yes God bless these rings... Those whom God hath joined let no man put asunder. You may kiss the bride. Enjoy yourselves... Catarina's marriage only took place because I never found the courage to say what I was thinking, to speak with sincerity. Only because I was afraid of taking on that responsibility... and one day regretting it. Damião is rich. That tipped the scales... because money is everything... Everything weighed... weighed nothing. I wanted nothing more than the dream of happiness for my daughter. Thank you! Alfredo, it's great that you managed to make it! Dear Damião, we don't forget those who've been with us from the very beginning! As my friend has no need of any of the material goods of this world as a wedding gift I'd like to offer you some advice: Now that you're married, don't share confidences. Ideally you shouldn't share any, but if you have to make them seem vague and fake. To love is to add value. Only a selfish man is capable of love. To help someone is to consider him incapable. Solidarity is only truthful if there's a selfish compensation from it. Civilization is only going to survive if altruism is eradicated. Dear Alfredo, I couldn't agree more! Wise words! I'm never wrong... and I rarely have doubts, my friend! Mr. Prime Minister... What an honor! Congratulations! Thank you so much. Well... I really have to go now. - As you imagine why... - Yes... Those ingrates... Fellow countrymen terrorists... inadmissible in our Portugal! Unfortunately, it's true, but measures are being taken. It's not only this wedding that we're going to celebrate! Well, I really have to go now. I wish you a sumptuous... honeymoon! Mr. Prime Minister, please have some cake... I really have to go... but, just a little bit... Magnificent! Magnificent! Wonderful! Decidedly Damião, democracy is the void. Equality's the main cause of the political and military enfeeblement of our system. Yes my love, but... We're all born free and equal, aren't we? "All men are born free and equal..." What nonsense is that, honey?! Oh, sorry... Sorry, I really have to answer this guy... Donald? OK... I know, I know... Yes... Don't worry. I will do the transfer right away. Keep up the good work! Oh! I loved your Tweet! I retweeted it immediately. Only a totally selfish man is capable of loving. Raymond! A present. Open it! For me? C'mon, open it! Congratulations! That Damião... He's a bit old... But he's a great catch! Yes, a great catch! You don't say. You don't say! Raymond! You know Damião is a good man. He's a reasonable man! At least our daughter is going to live a better life... the life that I imagined for us... that we never managed to have... Our daughter isn't for sale! Our daughter isn't for sale! - Papa!? - Watch the birdie... Stop it! Where am I going? Nowhere! I don't know... To find the right pathway and the true north... having intelligence and culture is not enough. You need a certain dimming of your dreamy eyes. Why fight for a pathway that isn't ours? WHY? You caught me on your cogwheel! On that cardboard carousel that resembles life for you... but, it's made of cardboard! I am neither outside or inside! But... that isn't possible! The spirit of sacrifice is a force... not a weakness! But my sacrifice is useless, it's only weakness and being overcome. Useless sacrifice! No, no... I am not responsible for this! No! I am not responsible... No, no... But, yes... I am responsible. Pay attention. Don't let them trick you. Do not think that I'm crazy! Life is a serious thing that we shouldn't play with... Are there people who don't think about this? Is it possible? People who do not wonder about their reason for living? No, no, my friends... my illness is Lucidity. Don't worry, it will pass... it will pass... Citizens! Return to your homes. The curfew is mandatory. Citizens: The curfew is mandatory! The curfew is mandatory! Dissidence is Treason! Loyalty is the truth of feeling! Dissidence is Treason! Portugal belongs to us! Long live United Portugal! Security in Peace! All for the Nation! Nothing stands against the Nation! Portugal belongs to us! Long live Nuclear Portugal! Dissidence is Treason! Citizens... Peaceful People of Portugal... to Think is to Kill. Only Routine is Maternal. Citizens... the curfew is mandatory. Return to your homes now! What do you fucking spies want? Want to look up my arse? Here's my arse! Look! Look! Citizens, return to your homes now. Let us do our job! There's no escape from control! How on earth did we get ourselves into this situation? How can people swallow so many lies? Life is made of truths which together form a lesser truth. One truth makes another truth a lie. If only they could live separately... far from one another. But no... it's best to doubt everything. If someday I could erase all the lies that I've constructed... it would cause a cataclysm! CATACLYSM! Why am I so anguished? It makes no sense... Why am I so anguished? Why? Am I going mad? And why do I think aloud? That's the first step to madness. Paris... so near and yet so far... Dear Paris... Destroyed Paris... Decadent Paris... Just like me! Hey, Monsieur Elevator! Take me to Paris! Take me to Paris!! I'm asleep. Asleep. I have to wake up! I must be ready to jump wherever. Ready to run all the pathways until I discover the right one... There's a compass inside me. It guides me and shows me true North. Everyone has their own magnetic pathway. Each of us has a unique compass. Magnetic pathways... I must wake up from this sleepwalking. I need to think with clarity about the important things in my life. I've lost all my money... my love! My daughter... Mr. Raymond... Ah! I know! I'll visit my friend André. He always said I could bring problems of health, love or money to him. Not that I believe in spiritualism, but he always said I'd be very welcome. Well... I'll surprise him! I'll surprise him! Nyarlatotep! Messenger of the Gods, please hear us! These mere mortals beseech you To communicate with the Great Cthulhu The god who dreams during the blackness of his death! Nyarlatotep! Please bring an end to this catastrophe! Please put an end to this people's suffering! Please behead this evil Hydra that treads our pathways! Nyarlatotep! Nyarlatotep! Nyarlatotep! Nyarlatotep! A man... is the mask of a star. A soul... is the face of the star. RAYMOND Good evening, André. Shhhhhhh! Mr. Raymond! What happened? What are you doing here? Shouldn't you be at your daughter's wedding? Yes, I should, but... shhhhhh! Smoke this Raymond. It will be good for you. Oh Nyarlatotep! The crawling chaos...! Nyarlatotep! Nyarlatotep! Mr. André? I wish to know when I'll cease to be... a virgin... She is not unattractive... she is pretty. She laughs freely. She's an amateur poet. She's very educated. Now you are chaste. Monastic life is not good for you. You are not a man to do much in the world if you remain chaste. But, Mr. André, what else! She is like you, a virgin... She is a masculine type of girl. She will make a man of you. - She is the wine you need to drink. - But... Do not resist. - She must make you your own slave. - But, Mr. André... Go to a café. But, don't go to The Brazilian. Do not make any plans. The time is near... You will be celebrated and adored, Fernando. Enough! André, what can you tell me about my future? Mr. Raymond... You are the center of an astral conspiracy, The meeting place of highly malign elements... nothing more. Mr. Raymond... you lack courage to clarify ambiguous situations... even the simplest ones. Mr. Raymond, you are very lazy... but soon you will cease to be so. An inheritance? Yes. - An inheritance, that's it. - Will the money come from France? No one has spoken of money... Money isn't everything! You need to understand that money isn't everything! Money isn't everything... Money isn't everything... Money isn't everything... Money isn't everything! Well, but... I need money, you know? Money isn't everything! The greed that exists in the world will have to end! End when? Where? How? The world will end before that! Get out! Get out! Mr. Raymond... Get out of here! Get out of here! I'm sorry... Goodnight everyone... excuse me. Why did André stare at me like that? Pfffft... No, no... how rude! With friends like that... it's better to have none. "You are the Center of an Astral Conspiracy..." What did he mean by that? "The Center of an Astral Conspiracy..." "The Center of an Astral Conspiracy..." With his zombie eyes... We're nothing without money... Money isn't everything... Money isn't everything! It's better to Be than to Have Money enslaves! Money makes us go crazy! We are nothing without money... When was the last time you paid a bill? When was the last time you paid a bill? When was the last time you paid a bill? When was the last time you paid a bill? When was the last time you paid a bill? Without money we are nothing... Money isn't everything... Money isn't everything... Without money we are nothing... Without money we are nothing... Money isn't everything... Money isn't everything... Without money we are nothing... Better a little than nothing? Maybe... You can't have everything in life. To live is to lack something every day. Something... is better than nothing. At least Catarina has one thing: Money! Money! Bucks! Big bucks! Dough is everything. Dough! Dough! Our daughter is not for sale! No! Our daughter is not for sale! No! It's better to have nothing than just a little bit... Having nothing is better than having just a little bit. That's it! That's it! Nothing! It's better to have nothing! Nothing! You are the center of an Astral Conspiracy! You are the center of an Astral Conspiracy! The meeting place of highly malign elements... You are the center of an Astral Conspiracy... Suffocation... Suffocation... Raymond! Raymond... Raymond... how are you? - Daniela? - What are you doing here? What are you doing here? Raymond... I can trust you... yes? Yes... Come. Come with me. Citizens, return to your homes! André?! What is he doing here? He's our leader. Leader? Brothers... the time has come to announce my decision. It is the social fictions that tyrannize us, not the men who embody the tyranny. Men are the medium that the fictions use to tyrannize, Just as the knife is the medium for the assassin to kill. Certainly you don't believe abolishing knives abolishes assassins? If you destroy all the capitalists without destroying the capital, the very next day capital will be in the hands of others and will continue its tyranny through those men. Capital is the greatest social fiction of our time. We all want freedom, yes? Freedom!! It's social fictions we must destroy if we want to remain free. What do we have to do? It's very simple... If being together will create new social fictions and tyrannies, We all have to work towards the same end, but separately! We work separately? We stand by? This isn't the time for individualism, it's time to stir things up! Do what thou wilt. That's the law. The only law! André! You're an asshole! You? What are you doing here? Are you a spy? Raymond... - Listen to me... - Yes? I've made a decision... We're going to blow up the Tagus Bridge! - The Tagus Bridge?! - Yes! - You're insane! - No! You're insane! No... violence can only be fought with violence! No! Who lives by the sword, dies by the sword! But, aren't you a revolutionary like me? Yes, I used to be... I used to be... a revolutionary...

The meeting place of highly malign elements... Name? NAME? Raymond Vachs. Vaches? Vachs. Profession? Unemployed photographer and Komix author. Where did you hide the weapons? What? Where did you hide the weapons? I've never had weapons. What were you doing there? - Just walking around... - WALKING AROUND?! I don't remember... Your silence might count against you. According to this report... you've lived in Portugal since 26th April 1974. Yes, I came photograph the Revolution. We know everything about it. With Hara-Kiri magazine as assistant to the photographer Chenz. That magazine is now Charlie Hebdo. It was a long time ago. They rejected my work. They said I wasn't satirical enough, that I'd sold out to the Carnation Revolution. Then you were invited by Vasco Granja that Pink-Panther communist... To collaborate on a comics magazine And in an animation Centre. Mmhmm. It was there that I met my wife... Gertrudes. You quit both animation and photography. Why? I still worked for a few magazines but... Gertrudes said that my work didn't have a future, and I gave up. Catarina, my second daughter, was born after my wife's heart surgery. She's the most precious thing in my life. Enough already... This is not a confessional. Next! Let me go you shits! Let me go you dicks! You bastards! Fascist motherfuckers! I'm the face trampled by the invaders who crossed my blood, devirginating it. The dog from limbo rabidly bit the naked legs of my unbaptized soul. You, who say you are a man... You, that claim so many findings and discoveries You manage to become more and more of a beast and this progress you call civilization... Meanwhile I'm straining my throat to insult you, you beast! You mountebanks, you band of hooligans! Gangsters, smugglers of stupidity! The bourgeois! The ideal with a little "I"! You easy profit! Coitus of the impotent! Taking a sunbath by the river of stupidity! I am the Seven Plagues of the Nile and the tormented soul of the Borgias! Zutt beast! Zutt pig! Zutt shit! Hold on... Why? Where were you? Where are our Comrades? I'm not involved with revolutions anymore... - Understand señor? - Nothing? - Nothing. - You don't know anything? - You didn't hear anything? - No! But... you were with us. It's not that I don't believe in you... I don't mistrust you! But, prisoners aren't supposed to talk to each other... OK? Seriously, I don't know anything. Raymond, you're a weakling and good for nothing! What is this pain I feel? I don't know what it is... Why did I stay here in Portugal? It was the revolution that brought me here... Why didn't I leave? Why? What is this "New Order?" Catarina's voice: Receive this ring as a token of my love... No! It's better to have nothing than only a little bit! It's better to have nothing than only a little bit! That's it! Catarina's voice: Do you think marrying him is the right choice? Catarina's voice: Are you sure, Papa? Catarina's voice: Why don't you say something? Catarina, my sweet daughter... Nothing! Nothing! Catarina's voice: Damião is so thoughtful... It's better to have nothing than only a little bit! Catarina's voice: As a proof of my fidelity... Papa? Papa? I must warn you that despite not having anything proven against you, from this moment on you must be more cautious with your friendships. For the moment, you owe your liberty to a good friend... your son-in-law, Senōr Damião Vaz. But, remember, some situations are impossible to remedy. Thank you, Captain Spínola. My father-in-law is not in a state for which he can be held responsible. His life in Portugal has not been easy. He's an artist, you know... My dear friend Damião Vaz... you are a philanthropist. Let's go Raymond, everyone's waiting for you. My dear Raymond, you must understand that now you're my father-in-law you have to rise to the level of your new position. Your life will never be the same again, do you understand? Yes, Damião. António, hurry up! I'm sorry... It's the most important day of your life... Papa... Papa... Where've you been, papa? What happened? Are you all right, papa? What happened? Do you hang around with terrorists now, Papa?! You could have died! Thank you, Damião... If it hadn't been for you, Damião... Papa would still be in jail. Can someone please tell me what happened? The poor man didn't do anything... "Didn't do anything..." - This parasite never did anything! - It was a misunderstanding... A "misunderstanding?!" On the day of your daughter's wedding... Aren't you ashamed? You're an asshole... A toad! Look at me! LOOK AT ME! Damião, I apologize for him... It's OK, it was just a misunderstanding. Our whole life is a "misunderstanding!" I'm his "misunderstanding"... This man is a disaster... You did it on purpose... You're not half the man you were. Think about your daughter, about her marriage, about Damião... - It's over, forget it... - Show a little respect! Darling, shall we get changed? We must leave before sunrise, yes João? Affirmative! It's safer to leave before dawn. Girls... Can I give you a lift? Can I give you a lift? Motherfucker... Mr. Raymond... Mr. Raymond... You lack the courage to clarify ambiguous situations... Even the easiest ones... No, no, no...! Damião! Motherfucker! I'll kill you, Damião! I'll kill you, Damião! I'll kill you! I'll kill you! I'll kill you! I'll kill you! I'LL KILL YOU! Papa! No, no... I can't kill him... Catarina would never forgive me. Now... there is just one thing to do... I'll jump! I'm going to jump! I'll kill myself. This parasite never did anything at all... This parasite... parasite... Kill myself? Me? How do I find the strength to kill myself? When I am not even capable of saying what I think? I'm a coward! A coward! I'm a coward! I'm a coward! This is what I wanted to confess to you: I'm a coward! I even denied it to myself... This man is a disaster. This parasite never accomplished anything. He's an artist you know. This man is a disaster. From now on you must be more cautious with your friendships. Do you hang around with terrorists now, Papa? This parasite... From now on you must be more cautious with your friendships. Do you hang around with terrorists now, Papa? Your life will never be the same. An indecisive man is good for nothing. You're the man, Damião! Raymond, an indecisive man is good for nothing. Catarina! Catarina! Catarina! Catarina! Catarina! Catarina! Papa! - Papa! - Calm down. Mr. Raymond! Damião... he jumped! We have to go back for him! - Please Damião! We have to go back! - Calm down. He fell in! - Mr. Raymond! - Careful, Fernando, you might fall in! Papa! Take Mr. Raymond home, please. Who's gonna pay for the upholstery? He needs to dry off first. Open the door now! NO! Catarina! Soldiers! Catarina! Catarina! Catarina! Sir, would you kindly sit on the floor? There is a horrible smell coming from your wet clothes. DRIVER Your face made of roses has the evasive colors of an official report. I wish I could hold you in my arms... oh my bank account! What the hell is going on? Why are you crying? You're going home, not to prison. Did you mean to throw yourself in the river? - No. - Then you are a lucky man. You were lucky to survive, yet you are weeping like a widow. I don't know why you despise me. Look at me one moment more. Nasty cut of expenses... Adored abolition... of the floating debt. You're mocking my poverty, you motherfucker, is that it? You asshole! That's enough! - Take it easy. - Shut up! Take it easy. We're almost there. That'll be 200 escudos. 2000 euros. What were you expecting? You know there's no other public transportation in Lisbon. Life in Portugal isn't easy these days. I'll go get the money. - OK. - I'll be right back. You better be... Good morning Portugal. The Fatherland rules our hearts. Safety in peace. Good morning dear Citizens and your respective families. Citizens: A band of criminals of the worst type whose miserable rebellion of the past few days has darkened and bloodied the streets of the Capital have met the end they deserved. But, the bodies of the innocent, the bodies of the heroes who sacrificed themselves in a sacred duty for Order and the salvation of the Fatherland the blood of these heroes cries out for justice. Justice will be done. Mr. Raymond! Raymondo... Is the party still in full swing? Have you been up all night? - Huh? You drunkard. - Dissidence is Treason The Fatherland rules our hearts. Dissidence is Treason! Long live Portugal! Will you give me... 200 escudos? 200 escudos?! I need to pay the driver... You want cash? Well, you won't get it. Micro dick... Bravo... stealing from your daughter's savings. Your daughter's money! You bastard! Andreia... please take this... Take it downstairs to the driver. OK. I'll take it downstairs.
