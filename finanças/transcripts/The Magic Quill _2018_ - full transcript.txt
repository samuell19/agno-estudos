Punk Film in co-production with - Your parents scared you with tales of devils. The bogeyman 'round the corner ready to drag you to Hell. Stories for little children! In reality, Hell is more like an office of government... albeit an office charged with punishing sins: your sins. CAST Casting Executive Producer Make Up Costumes Art Designer I Production Designer VFX Supervisor Music Sound Editing Cinematography Written by Producers Directed by - So... Let's get on with it. Selka Bendova. Sins: 18 millstones over! Gossip and slander 12 st,, Betrayals 5 st. 3/4, and 20 pecks of Blasphemy! -100% guilty. Fetch the sinner for the pot! Let sins be damned! - Damned! THE MAGIC QUILL The Office of Hell has had this function time out of mind, dealing Eternal Justice, with every sinner punished without prejudice. But to punish them, their sins must first be recorded and recorded exactly. And that's why we have the Devil's Quill, from the tail of the black cockerel of the Prince of Darkness himself. Without it, the Office of Hell would be quite lost! - Trouble with Quill! It's dropped dead! - Horror! Fortunately, there isn't just one Devil's Quill, just as there isn't only one Hell... Our Office is very complex. The world is large, with many cities, towns and villages. So our devils can be everywhere and not have to flap all over the place, we have branches in every district, a municipal underworld network. All reporting to Hell HQ, to the Lord of Pandemonium - to Lucifer himself. - To me, in fact. - Your Lowness... - Yes... - Sub-Hell Pitchfork Hill, Sackville, reporting. We've got a problem: Our Quill's dead as a doornail! Kaput! - How long for? - Two or three hours. - What? That long without any record of sins?! Order a new Devil's Quill at once! Sinners sin and you know nothing about it! - Can see the consequences. But otherwise our figures are good. Last month we filled 13 pots of sinners, and more pots are on the way, Your Lowness! Glad to hear it. - For example, local elections are being held in Sackville, so there'll be no shortage of sinning. And we have a promising candidate on the other side of the Pitchfork Hill. He's a lazy tailor who does absolutely nothing. - And that sinner there, who is she? - That is Marketa, the daughter of the innkeeper. - Now that's an interesting sinner. Have we something on her? -I'm sorry, Your Lowness, she doesn't sin at all. On the contrary. - At all? Only what you'd call acts of charity... - Oh, so she's not a sinner at all. Better keep an eye on her, guys! They're the worst of all. Keep away from her. Clear? - Yes, yes, of course. I'll take care of it... I will ensure you are satisfied, Your Lowness... What's going wrong now?! That boy will drive me demented! Boniface! Boniface, come here immediately! Boniface! Boniface! Boniface! Boniface! Himmel Herrgot, can't you hear me? What are you doing here? This is the fourth time you've interrupted the hotline to Hell! - I'm sorry, Your Majesty, I'm just trying out my new invention. It's a Flame-maker. - What in Hell's that? - A device to start fires. - Fires?! Boniface, for crying out loud, come here! We start fires like this! Your go. - I'm not very good at devil magic... - Now you. Come on! - You're just not trying. Instead of learning honest magic, you work on this nonsense. -It's not nonsense... That's my Hand-i-Handy. Because if you need something, you can just pull it out with a flick of a hand. See? A knife, magnifier, screwdriver, magnet, pepper; if someone attacks you, just blow up and... Boniface, such trinkets are alright for humans. But we are devils. We use devil magic. Our job is to imprison sinners, otherwise the world as we know it will cease to make sense. Is that clear? - That's clear. - I'm glad of that, boy. Genuinely glad. - That's why I invented this... Have you been using devil kit without permission? - For progress, Your Lowness, everything for progress... This is a Quickclutch. I call it that, because if you attach it to something, it works at turbo speed. It's turbo-quick! - What is it good for? - It can speed up the bringing in of sinners. - Turn it off! - That was the last straw! I'll give you progress! - Don't want to go upside! Quiet! You spend all your time indoors sitting on your...! Instead of acting like a proper devil, you've become a deadly nerd. You're going for field-training to Pitchfork Hill, in Sackville! Where is that? I've never heard of it before. - That's where they'll make a devil out of you and wipe all this nonsense out of your head! Their Devil's Quill just died, and you'll bring them a new one. Mr. Slime, are you in? Slime, can you hear me? Master Slime, neighbour! What do you want? Master Slime, I have a hole in my jacket. Um, that's nasty. A very nasty hole. - That's why I need you to patch it up. - Not really! Don't do patches anymore. No time for it. Sorry! Patch his hole, indeed! Clown! Now, let's get to work. Here today! Spoon, matches, coathanger... Let's go, Marketa. Finally! Now you'll fall in love with me, Marketa! A horseshoe? What the hell is a horseshoe doing here?! - Shouldn't I have a tail? - Tall, horns, and hooves are only for rounding up sinners. Otherwise, we wear civvies, but you know that, don't you? - Yes. But so you don't say I'm sending you Into the world empty handed, I'm giving you my box of devil magic: My DAK - The Devil's Aid Kit. But I have my Hand-i-Handy and Quickclutch. - Your toys won't save you from anything. But this can feed you, dress you and supply you with money. - But it's all green and things. Do I really have to? - You must, boy! Forgive me, Quilly! - Shouldn't I put it in my bag? - Whenever you want to hide something, best keep it in open sight! But above all, avoid human contact. - Can sinners harm devils? Not exactly. But some are very cunning. You might make contact with a non-sinner and catch something sentimental. Be wary of that! I only met one once, and developed a bad case of poetry! I still have a problem thanks to that, and I don't quite know how to fix it. - What problem? - A big problem, boy. Very big. Now, off you go! What are you doing? You'll have to walk, otherwise you'll never get there. Let sin be... - Bye byes! -...damned! Now get out! - God bless all here! - Your suitors are here. Maybe you should Just pick one of them. - Daddy, what choice is that when they both look exactly the same? Not great. That one's hat is different. - That's not enough. I want someone more different. Gruss Gott! - Dear Lord. That one's different enough. Gruss Gott! - You look great today, Marketa. - Know, you say that every time. And now it's your turn... Me? Well, won't you ask me what you always do? - I just wanted to ask if you had chosen between us...? - Yes. And I'll answer you like always... Well, you could say you can't decide, we're just too good-looking, right? - Letting us down nicely today, Isn't she? - So... Now it's your turn, - Yes. Marketa, I wanted to tell you... - That you don't have a penny, but you have a fierce hunger, right? Well, that too. If there were a drop of soup going to waste, well have my spoon... Thank you, Marketa, very much! God bless you... - Thank you so much, and when I find my treasure, I'll make everything up to you, you'll live like an Empress... - Yes, yes, if you'd only found it already. - Almost had it today... Mr. Innkeeper... just one more for the road! - No, I will not give you any more. There's your bill for the month. Well, I'll pay you everything, even give you a big tip, just as soon as I find my treasure... - Come back when you've found it! Marketa, why don't we go out together under the moon? It's such a beautiful night... - With you under the moon? I never wanted anything more, Master Tailor... Really? - But another time! God damned! - What are you doing here?! I always shelter here! - How do you always shelter here? I'm sheltering here now. Your always can't always be always! - Who the Hell are you anyway? A visiting hunter, or what? - You won't be afraid if I tell you? - Don't frighten, not even afraid of the devil. Well, that's all right then. - So you're a devil, are you? - In person. - Shouldn't you have some horns, then? Can I touch them? - Please do. - They're kind of small... - They're natural. We only use the big ones to catch sinners. - See. Well, if you're a devil, perhaps you could tell me... Do not you know if there's any buried treasure nearby? - Not a clue. Well, you're no use to me! Maybe some magic at least? So I'm not so cold? Wait a moment... I think I have something. What about this? It's called a Hasty Needle... It can make any clothes you think of. Well then, think of a nice warm coat seeing as It's raining. - That's fantastic! Real quality! This material! It's a beauty! Can I keep it? What else you got? What about that towel thing? - That's a Magic Napkin. It can make food. - Try it! Yowza! Beer and chicken! May I? Thank you. And what about that bag there? T's a Bottomless Purse. It makes money. Please make some money... Give it to me, will you? Thank you. Make me another one! Please! Wow! Thank you. Just a moment! The one I put in my pocket is gone! The second one's gone now! - Ah, there's really only one coin. The purse is bottomless OK, but there's only one gold piece that keeps coming back. Well, that's a cruel trick! But that needle, could you lend it to me? I am a tailor... - It won't help you either. According to the instructions, it says anything it makes lasts only one day. I always said devil magic was useless. - Yes, quite useless. But you're still a devil, are you not? So to be fair, I'll give you something. So you won't say 'ma beggar. Take it. What is it? - Fruit juice. Have some, don't be afraid. We'll drink our sorrows away. I got my marching orders again today. Where to? - What where to? - Where do you have to march? - You're quite the clown you are! But I like you, lad. Have some more! - Damn, my head hurts! I will never drink fruit juice again! Where's my magic box? The sinner... has actually sinned! The Magic Quill! Where is it? Oh, this is the real Hell! - If you're looking for a beer, We aren't open yet. - Yes. I don't want any beer. - What do you want? To steal our eggs? - No. - Then why are you here? - That's a good question... why I'm here...? I can't answer you completely because it's my own business, and it's secret, so, you understand? - And this is our own yard, so you can go and do your business elsewhere. - Are you a sinner? I didn't know the sinners looked like you... - And are you stone deaf or did you not hear me? - I'm not... Yes, I'd better go somewhere... But where? 'Maybe back to your hide. - Ah, I see, you think I'm a hunter. I'm not a hunter really. - So you're not stealing our eggs, you're stealing our hens instead! - No, you're wrong, that's a cockerel. - And I wasn't stealing him, just his feather. - Get away, you thief! - OK, as you wish... Can I ask you something? Do you know where Pitchfork Hill is? - You're standing on it, dumbo. - Ah, but that's great! You wouldn't have to pull so hard if you attached a Quicklutch to it. Got this kinda feelin', like I never known, so what? Today my mind is reelin'! I know I'm not alone! Now what? People, tell me, if you can get it, what's up with me if you can understand it... Why my heart's all in my mouth and, next thing I wanna run away and shout it... And I'm feeling like I dunno... what! Like somethin' great is... what I got! Like that girl just put me on the spot! - Got this kinda feelin', like I never known, so what? What's gotten me start reelin'? And why, I gotta know! What now? People, tell me, if you would be so very kind, what am I doin' when I don't know my own mind... While my heart beats just like a mad thing, I wanna cry and I just really gotta sing... And I'm feeling like I got it... bad! And I'm feelin' like it's really... good! That it might be the real thing with that lad! - Got this kinda feelin', like I never known, so what? What net am I bein' reeled in? And why, I wanna know! Now what? People, tell me, if you can get it, what's up with me if you can understand it... Why my heart's all in my mouth and, next thing I wanna run away and shout it... And I'm feeling like I'm flyin' high! And I'm feelin' like I'm just a child! Like maybe it's that girl that took my eye! Hellsbells! I've caught poetry! - Oyez, Oyez, burghers of Sackville, listen ye verily unto the results of the final count of votes as voted by you. That is, your votes for the new Big kahuna of Sackville... Mayor. Mayor. Said office to be transferred to him who has been chosen by you, by your Mayor, Mr. Fakewell, the out-going Mayor. If you please. - Dear burghers, you have chosen as Mayor... Well, what a surprise! It's me again! I thank you for your trust and I promise that whereas last year we built a new haywain together, this year we shall build together a new barn! Do you know anyone who voted for him? - Nope. - Nor do I. Mr. Boney, you can't just leave this! Speak up! Tell them what you think! - What do I think? - That we won't have the wool pulled over our eyes! Go on! - Tricksters, we won't have the wool pulled over our eyes! - We want new elections! - We want new elections! - Yeah! - We want new elections!! - Neighbours, to see how much I respect your trust, I have prepared a small post-election celebration for you. Beer, sausages, sausages, beer, beer! And all for free! - Hurrah! - These elections are getting more and more demanding. - But you are good at it, boss, and it always comes out right! - As long as you have enough beer and sausages, you can do what you want with people. But, what are you doing here? Who's a little piggy, eh? Into your little house now! - Can I go for a beer too, seeing as it's free? Run along, the town is paying! - Thank you, boss! - Run along! You're mine again, Sackville! - So it really was just for one day... That's a fine trick! What use is anything that lasts only one day? What's that? Another piece of devilry! So let's see what you're scratching! Damn it, it's about me! The Tailor Slime stole Lucifer's DAK box from the devil Boniface. This is a misrepresentation. I merely borrowed stuff. I never stole it! Along with the box he also took the hat of the devil Boniface... That is a gross slander! I had that hat on my head when I ran away and I forgot that I had it on, so that was basically an unfortunate accident. Change it! Change it! And along with his hat he stole the Devil's Quill, which was to record the sins in the town of Sackville, by the Pitchfork Hill. That's all stupid lies, that! Aha, but you aren't just writing about me. Mayor Fakewell faked the results of the elections in Sackville, and he made himself Mayor again illegally. That's really bad! Now I see how devils always know everything about everybody. Only they don't know how to use it properly. Something should be made of this. With this lot I can do things that even Lucifer never dreamt of. - Did he explain why it took him so long to reach you? - No. But he's all soaking wet and dripping with water. - Soaking wet, why is he soaking wet? - We don't know. What is he doing now? Blowing air at the Quill. Probably trying to dry it out! The Quill wet too? - Yes. He says he has to start it up. Or something. - It should be writing by itself long since. Look here, if he offers to use any of his gadgets, stop him at once, you understand, boys! Make him work! Turn him into a proper devil, is that clear? - Yes, Your Lowness! - There you go, eh! That will be my barn. So! - Oyez, oyez, be it known His Essellence has come to see you! - You idiot?! I nearly died! - Sorry, but... you have a visitor. - Thank you. - Who are you? - Am His Excellency the Count von Pintlich, envoy of the Emperor, with responsibility for the country matters. Your town crier showed me in. His Essellence gave me a whole gold coin, boss! - Put it somewhere safe, boy. Don't lose it! - This is an honour, your Excellency! And may I ask, pray, the purpose of your visit? Certainly, I need your shoes! Mr. Boney! Mr. Boney! - Oh, God! - I can hardly breathe! - Did you have to guzzle so much? But Betty, it would be a shame to leave something behind. It was for free. Exactly why you are a demonstration of the fact that people should get nothing for free. It's bad for their health. - Give me a kiss! - Home! You stink! We are going home! - Gentlemen, the Emperor has but one major criticism of your town. It is poor because the road to it is too long. We must shorten the way, by digging a tunnel! - Your Excellency, that would be incredibly expensive. And you yourself acknowledged that our town is very poor. - Our subjects shall do the digging, the burghers that is. - Why would they actually do that? - For the same reason as you, Mr. Fakewell. Please read. - These are... blatant lies, they are!. I am not a thief. It was but a possible plan... - know what you were planning. So I advise you to cooperate! Well, if the Emperor himself cares about our town and thinks a hole will help us, then... Let's get digging! - That's much more like it, Mr. Mayor! So, here you go, boy! You will announce these new laws in the morning! - Shall you be needing anything else, Your Excellency? - Yes. Do you have a secure, well-guarded building you no longer use? - The armory in the tower could do. - Excellent. Get me the keys and some guards. We will in fact be hunting for treasure. - Understand. - Your Essellence, I bring the keys and the guards. - Can you read? Excellent! Let's go. - Marketa, time to sleep. - I'm coming, Daddy. - And you'll get a meal like this every day for free. Not just at election times. And every day, there'll be beautiful formal dress like this. Don't you want to try it on, Mr. Boney? Now you are a real nobleman! Gentlemen, I don't know. I have to ask my wife. I'm not sure what we think about it. Well then, Mr. Boney, if we don't do this by hook, it will be by crook. Please. Read this. But, you can't know about this, nobody even saw me! - As you can see, Mr. Boney, we can see what nobody saw. So what now? Will you cooperate with us? Well, okay, then. - So, that was that. One thing more... Could I take the chicken with me? - Of course, It is yours. - This way. - Thank you. - So first we convince the people and then we close the road. - Road? Which road? - The one over the hill of course. No one must come here while we dig the tunnel. But there's a market on Saturday. - Think, Mr. Mayor. The markets will not be needed. We'll give people clothes and food. - But there's the Inn, no one will be able to go there. We're looking for treasure. We have to close the Inn. And a certain person will finally realize that I always wanted the very best for her. - I really do not know what to do. Take a look. T's still just lying there? - Still. Oh my! You imp, you! - Come here, Boniface, I say come here! Look, are you sure you started the Quill right? Well, maybe it was wet, it'll take a while to get going. - Yes, but this long?! 'Maybe nobody is sinning... - You mean it's not writing anything because people have stopped committing sins? - Yes, that's a very reasonable explanation. People are no longer sinning! - But what are we going to do? We are here to imprison sinners. - Yes, what are we going to do? I'll tell the old man, let the higher-ups deal with it. We're not the bosses here. - No, no, we certainly aren't telling anyone! And until people start sinning again, you are free to go. Free? - Yes. - That would mean we can go to the Inn for a beer! - You know the old man told us not to go wandering around people. - Exactly! Definitely, don't go there. I'll pop up there for you. I'm the newest in the job, after all! - So, am I dreaming now? - No, I don't think so. You'd have to be asleep. But you are not asleep. I made you a Quicklutch. - What have you done? Watch. How did you do that? - It was just fast. But now I need five beers. - Come along then. Was that magic? What? - Well, with the well? No. Magic doesn't really work for me, so I make inventions. - You must be very clever. - Yes. I must, Gentlemen, I have not decided yet. - But, Marketa, give us a chance today! - Yes, we haven't even asked you anything yet... - You always ask the same thing. We bought new hats so we wouldn't be the same. - Gentlemen, I'm sorry, but I've met someone without a single hat. - But we can give you some flowers, can we not? - For the last time, right? Now you're quits! Why did they give you those? Is it normal for humans to give someone plants? Well, men give women flowers because they want to make them happy. - Aha. - What about the beer? - So, we're here without our hats. - Yes, without your hats you're even better looking than with them. - Oooooch! - What's this? Plants. You said women are given plants. - Said flowers. But thank you. - Yes, and then this! I thought the men did that. No, this is right. What's your name, anyway? - Boniface. - I'm Marketa. - Know. - Oyez, Oyez, be it known that a tunnel will be dug, so the road to Sackville is closed. And because all the locals will do the digging, strangers must leave immediately. - What does this mean?! This place belongs to Mr. Innkeeper and Marketa. - You have no right, this is a private business. We'll complain! Move on, move on, off you go! - This is the only way to Sackville. - Indeed, but it's too long. Come on, go, go! - Eat, drink up, get out. - What are you doing here? Have you gone mad? - Boss, boss, we have a problem! A troublemaker doesn't agree with us. - Just one? And you couldn't handle him could you? - Daddy! Boniface, get away quickly! Let's make it clear, Innkeeper. Are you registered in Sackville town? Ham. - Then take note that your trade is herewith suspended. From now on you are commissioned by Count von Pintlich to dig a municipal tunnel in return for clothing and food. - I am an innkeeper. I will not dig for any "Punktlich"?. Really? You think so, then we'll take you straight to jail! - Wait. I'll dig for him. - You? But that is not possible. The count sends you this. - Oyez, Oyez, be it known His Essellence is inviting you to an amputation! - Audience! - Said that! - Depart! Hurry! Hurry! Let's go! - Boniface, for God's sake, where are you? This is taking forever. - Sorry, the beer's inside. - Well then... What is this?! The head's gone off. - There was a terrible rumpus, and they shut up shop. - They're closed? - Yes, they took them all to Sackville. - And how long will they be closed for? Hard to say. Boys, boys, come on! Not a sinner here! For beer...! - Where are you going? - To Sackville. Won't you have something, miss? His Excellency says we have to give you everything you desire. - So let me and my daddy go! - That I cannot. Your father refused to cooperate, so... it's not possible. Do you really not want anything? - Oyez, oyez, be it known that His Essellence is here! - Fool! You're supposed to say His Excellency, the Count von Pintlich hither comes! - But I can't remember all that, Your Essellence... But, what is this? The young lady is not satisfied? - She's like a dragon. Doesn't even want the stuffed pheasant. - Take it to her father. He's also our guest. So, go on, get! We have not seen each other for along time, Marketa! - Do not know you. - Not even like this? - Slime?! - Indeed, and as I told you, you will live with me as an Empress. What the Hell are you doing here? - Come, Marketa, look what I have for you. You will walk in it every day. Now, now, stop that! Guards! - This is not how I imagined fine clothes. Every morning, they're in shreds! Betty, that's still amazing. Imagine if you had to wash them after every shift. This way, you can get a new one and go digging again. - That's another thing, who goes digging in anything like this? - That's just a question of habit. A princess wears gowns since childhood, but you've only had one for a few days. - Princesses don't dig holes No! Pheasant again! I can't look at another! Can't we get curds? - But Betty, you can't eat curds in fancy dress. What would that look like? - But it's OK to dig a hole in the ground like this, Mr. Boney? - Yes, indeed, but our hole Is a different class of hole! Well, that won't work. - Hello, Calling Pitchfork Hill, Sackville town! Why haven't I received any reports from you? Hello, calling the Sub-Lucifer! Herr Gott, can anyone hear me? Boniface, are you there? What's going on there? How come there's nothing happening there? Boniface! What's that boy done now? My love, it's a shame love is not a sin... We could all be together. - This is strange. I'll have to report this upstairs. - Don't worry about your daddy, Marketa. He's done nothing wrong after all. - So why did you arrest him? 'Me? I had nothing to do with it! That's all Fakewell. But on the other hand, it's better for your daddy, right? You don't want him digging like a slave. - But he hasn't done anything. - Unfortunately, Marketa, that's just how it goes here. I can't do anything about it. Fakewell is the mayor here. I confess, I'm afraid of him. He has such a weird twitch in his eye, did you notice? I just hope that nothing happens to your daddy. But if you were to marry me, that would change the situation fundamentally... - You? You mean... Marketa, for your father's sake, I ask for your hand. - Your Essellence, our subjects, that Is, the burghers have found something strange in the tunnel. - Damn you, do you have to use the drum? - I'm sorry, Your Essellence, but that's my job. I'm really good at it. - Indeed! Get out, you dumb ass! So Marketa, will you marry me? - I'll have to think about it. - Yes, of course. We're not going to rush headlong into things, are we? But don't think too long. Excuse me. - And here we are, Your Excellency. We'll be rolling in gold. Come down, Your Excellency! Don't shout, I'm coming down! T's big here! I am sorry Your Excellency, lam sorry. - Did you see anyone? - No. And no treasure either. We'll see. Follow me. The smell! That's you! - Yes, That's me. - This is me. - All blatant lies, Your Excellency. So, where's our treasure, then? - This is even better than treasure. This is Hell. - Hell? And what can we do with Hell? - Whoever controls Hell, can have paradise on Earth! From now on, we continue digging, to keep the road closed, but we will not do any digging. We will tell them we are still digging so they don't blame us that the road is closed. Do you get it? - While we in Sackville live like in paradise and no devils can carry us off to Hell! Exactly. That means we pack everything and take it all back to the town hall. Pack everything, and take it to the great hall! - Yes, quickly, before any devils come back! - Devils! Devils! Devils! Hurray!! - Devils are hairy as hairy goes, From their heads down to their toes! They go flying through the air, And never even muss a hair! - Padadah padadee! Padadah padadee! Kindling always at my knee, At my knee! Padadah padadee! Padadah padadee! Kindling underground you see! - So you see! So you see! - Devils! Devils! - Devils! Devils! - Your devils are the finest folk, work like dragons in the smoke, When they've got any spare time, in the pub they sing and rime! Yuchee-ayo-yuchuu, Yuchee-ayo-yuchuu, Kindling good and dry! Yuchee-ayo-yuchoo, Yuchee-ayo-yuchoo, Kindling even under a fly! Devils! Devils! Devils! Devils! Devils' Hurray! Boys, why is your Office of Hell abandoned? It's all dug up down there! Why is there a hole in the roof? And where are your horns, hooves and tails gone? How did you find us, Your Lowness? - You were howling like wild animals! You'd have to be deaf not to hear you! - The Magic Quill wasn't writing, so we thought no one was sinning. - What are you saying?! People always sin. Where did you get such a notion? - Boniface told us. I'll break him yet. - Your Highness, I've got insects climbing on me from these fake horns! - Suits you well! You shouldn't have let them steal your kit, you duffers! - As soon as we find them, we'll fry those sinners! - Your Lowness... - What is it? - Did they also steal your kit? - Protest! I am incognito, on an inspection. It never occurred to me I would need devil magic. - Oyez, Oyez, be it known that anyone who speaks of that which may not be spoken of will be publicly declared a liar. Let it also be known that as of this day there will not only be digging, but also re-filling on a daily basis beginning from today. And neither may that be spoken of by anyone. Hence, from now on, all Sackvillains shall have one fine dress extra and one extra fine meal. And even this may not be spoken of by anyone! Well, tell me, Marketa, is this not a wonderful evening? Imagine that we can live like this forever! Have you considered my proposal? Marketa, I drink to our life together! Marketa? - Your Essellence! Your Esscellence! - Your Highness, Your Highness... - Overrun! Hunters are overrunning Sackville! Not hunters, devils! They have horns! The patrol saw them over the river, Your Excellency, we should not have buried Hell. They're coming to take us all back to... - Exactly, Mr Mayor! Where are they going to take us? Besides, we've got their gear under lock and key, do we not? - And what if they get into the town? - Then we welcome them. Excuse me for this faux pas, but duty calls. Well, let's go! - Good evening. - Boniface! I wanted so much for you to come to me. - Excuse me, but I cannot slap you. - Dumbo, you slap someone when you don't want them to kiss you. A kiss deserves a kiss in return. - Have something to confess to you. I'm not really a hunter at all. - I know, I've thought so for a long time. And stop being so polite! Why? Well... when people are in love, they act more informally. - So I'm in love with you? - Yes, yes, it's true. And it looks quite serious. - And can it be cured? I am a devil! - You will just have to learn to live with It. That's the way for people, you know? The joy of having someone whom you love. And the pain when you lose them. - Pain? And do people like that? - Yes. - That's terrible. Why do you put up with it? - We have no choice. - Silence! Silence! I said be quiet! - But how can we open the gate quietly, Your Lowness? When I attack, I usually do it out loud! In any case, we need to get our hands on a battering ram, Certainly. - Alright, go back to the forest and get one! What's up? Nothing. - Didn't you hear me? - Yes, I did. - So get on with it! Run! - Boys! - Enter! - What am I thinking? Just a moment. What's up, miss? - Come here! - Don't understand, Mr. Innkeeper, why you don't give in. You can't get such fine food anywhere. I think it's a great stroke of luck the count appeared here. That's what it is, and nothing less! - Executioner! Executioner! Dammit don't call me that. I'm the jailer. I've never executed anyone. Off you go, and do it again properly! Away! Mister jailer... Mister jailer. - Well then, what is it? - They're looking for you upstairs. It seems the girl from the Inn has escaped. Well, I'll have to go then, won't I? They're completely useless without me. Look, you watch things here, okay? And don't eat anything, okay? That you, Marketa? I didn't recognize you. What are you wearing? Don't worry about that. We've come to save you, come on. - What is our kit doing here? - Good evening, Mr. Devils. Do you want me to open the gate? No, we want to attack you. - Betty, what are you doing here? - I'm helping the devils. - Have you taken leave of your senses? They'll take us all down to Hell! - Better to live in Hell than here. - But, you can't... you can't do that! We've never had it better than now! - Forward! Where is everyone? - Good evening, Powers of Hell! To what do we owe this terrifying visit? Humble yourself, sinner! You are talking to the Lord Lucifer himself! - Here. Give us our kit back, you worm! Certainly, yes! The worm is willing to serve. Follow me, please, follow me. I will return everything, we have everything here. Here, please, here, Your Greatness. Here, watch the step, your devilship. - Boys, why Is the Devil's Quill here? I'll beat that Boniface blue! The tailor Slime wants to lock the Prince of Hell and the other devils inside the tower... Back! At once! Are you crazy?! The whole place will go up in flames! - Have them, I have them, I have them all! I'm more devil than the Devil himself! Bravo, Your Excellency, bravo! Genius tactics, Your Humbleness! - Found one more, wandering around the gate. - People, please! I'm just coming back from hunting. I live on the other side of the hill. - They all say that! - Enough talk! Put him with the others. But what are we going to do with them now, Your Excellency? We cut out the evil at its very roots. We arrange a monster execution. - Bravo, Your Excellency! Careful, Your Excellency! - They've caught Lucifer himself. - What now? - Quickly upstairs! - Alarm, alarm! Here they are, they robbed me, alarm! - After them! - Your Essellence... Help, help, help! - Come on! - What have you done, stupid man! - I've had enough of you! Come on! Mr. Boney! - Down! - Gotcha! Marketa! Let her go! - Boniface, save yourself! Stay! - Now, now, now, Marketa! So, you have found another! That breaks my heart. I build paradise for you here, and you have... Do you see that, Mr. Fakewell? She's jilting me for another! Well, we'll fix that somehow. But can you tell me what the girl sees in you? I like the fact that you've cooperated, locking yourself in this pen! - I know who you are, you thief! And you'll fry in Hell! - That will be hard. I shut it down! Do you have a spare key? - Have. - Open it up. - Boniface, get away! - Damn it! - Let him go. We have Lucifer himself under lock and key. - Your Grace! Your Grace! We have the marauders. - Well, let's see this. - Must, unfortunately, inform you, Your Excellency, that my wife has got completely out of hand. She refuses to cooperate. She fights like a devil. - Yes? It's probably best to lock her up with the other devils then, right? Well, I thought maybe 25 lashes or so, you know? - Do you want to go with her? - No, not that! - So. Take her away. - You sold your soul so you can eat for free, Mr. Boney! - Good work, Boney. So, my dear Marketa, I have decided to forgive you. - For what? Well, for your adventure. - Do you mean Boniface? He's not an adventure. He's my boyfriend. - Ouch, that hurts, that hurts, my heart cannot hold! But yes, it will. Either you marry me in the morning and I'll save your daddy. Or you will not marry me and I'll have him executed with the others. So, you think about it. - Am the right fool! I had no idea who I married. - That Boniface, he's your son, isn't he? A bright lad. - And Marketa, is that your daughter? Very pretty. Well, what if we're executed, what'll we do, boys? We can't go to Heaven. - That's true. Logically, we're going to Hell, right? - So, In the end, it would seem like nothing really happened. What do you think, Your Lowness? - It's hard to say. What if some devil does something that can be considered good. Love, perhaps? He could have a chance of getting into Heaven. - Are you all right, Your Lowness? - In my view, when a devil does good, it is a sin and he still ends up in Hell. That's good, isn't it?! - And what if that devil's not a devil but a real hunter? - Hello there! Hellish fellows! A big day today! - Do I have to? I never killed a fly in my life, and now I'm gonna Kill devils... - Oyez! Oyez! Be it known that today good will come. So we have nothing but good times in Sackville, where there will be paradise right after good is... - Neighbours, even though we live a life of luxury, we are not happy. And I ask, who is responsible? Yes, who is responsible? Well? - Tell them the answer you want! The devils did it. - Yes! The devils did it! The devils did it! And my wife! - The devils did it! The devils did it! And his wife! We have heroically buried Hell together to bring an end to suffering and evil. But that was not good enough for the devils. They have come under cover of darkness to reverse our efforts to build Paradise on earth. No drums! Today's execution will be a warning to anyone who seeks to overturn our magnificent plan! - Death to Hell! Death to Hell! Death to Hell! Death to Hell! - But before we deal with these Hellish fiends, a very pleasant duty awaits you. You shall be witnesses to my wedding! - Long live weddings! Long live weddings! Long live weddings! Long live weddings! - You say that if I marry you, you will leave my father unharmed. Well, of course, yes, of course, but first the ceremony, then daddy. T's a wedding. My father must stand beside me! Marketa, don't annoy me now, please! - Shall we start, Your Excellency? Certainly, without delay. - Ask you, Count von Pintlich, do you take the daughter of the Innkeeper Mr. Malter, here present, of your own free will? - I do. - And you, Miss Marketa, do you take the Count von Pintlich here of your free will? - So, will it be yes or no? - No. No? - No! - Where does it have... - As you wish! Executioner, do your duty! What does this mean? - It means you're going to Hell! Let sins be damned! - Damned! - Help! You hairy monster! - It's all him. He misled me, pushed me, misused me. - True, Hellish gentlemen, I confess. It's all my fault. Mr. Fakewell couldn't do anything at all about it. But before you take me, I have one wish. I'd like to say goodbye to him. Friend! - Your Excellency! Your Excellency... Noooo! - Are you the one that caused such chaos in this miserable backwater?! - There will be a wedding... ours! - Devils! Devils! Devils! Devils' Hurray! - Don't know if I'm a widow or what I am. Why so? - If my husband's in Hell? Well, you must be single again. - Does that mean I'm half human? - Would say much more than half. Either way, you haven't inherited much from me. - That's not what I'd say. I'd just like to remind you, Your Majesty, that Boniface saved us all. - That's true. - Thank you. Did you use it? - I didn't, but others did more than enough. - And would you like it as a wedding gift? Better not, I'd rather invent real things. - Will you give us your blessing, Your Majesty? - That's the one thing I can't do, Marketa. Well, that's all. Well, almost all. - They robbed me, they robbed me! I got so many gold coins from His Essellence and they're all gone! - And why did I tell you this bedtime story, my little sinner friends? Remember this - and remember it well Those who want to put an end to Hell have little else in mind but ill! They are the most sinful of them all and punishment must sins befall or someone else must pay the bill! So do not trust their seeming worth who promise gold and Heaven on Earth, For Heaven must be earned - by you! - Why should love be so cruel, to steal men's hearts away? - Why are our hearts so weakly ruled, they invite love to stay? - Why is love in hiding deep in every heart it wants to keep? - And why do we have no defence at all when love brings us to trial? - You can offer me both great beauty and diamonds glittering bright, a stack of coins up to my waist, more than the stars of night! I'll only say because of these I'd thank the Heavens above but all these precious gifts I'd give just to have you, sweetest love! - You can offer me the greatest charms and crowds to line my way, caviar, gala nights and fanfare sounds, to welcome where e'er I stay! I'll only say because of these I'd thank the Heavens above but all these precious gifts I'd give just to have you, sweetest love! You can offer us the rosy glow of treasures bright and fine breakfast served in bed early morn until the end of time! We'll only say because of these We'd thank the Heavens above but all these precious gifts we'd give just to have you, sweetest love! Just to have you, sweetest love! - Just to have you, sweetest love! - Just to have you, sweetest love! - Just to have you, sweetest love! - Just to have you, sweetest love! - Just to have you, sweetest love! - Just to have you, sweetest love! Just to have you, have you, just to have you, sweetest love - For Love conquers all! The End
