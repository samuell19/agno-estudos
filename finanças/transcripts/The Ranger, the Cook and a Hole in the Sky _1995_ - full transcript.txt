[distant clanking] [man mutters] Come on, a second. That's it. Pick it up. Let's go. [man whistling] [whistling stops] Mud. Man: * They'll be a hot time in the old town tonight... * Cheers. [singing continues] It's bad luck to sing around dynamite, Mac. * All join round * And sweetly hear you sing * [whistles] Okay, up! - Sorry. - Here we go. Get out of the way. Get out of the way. That's what the fuse is... * They'll be a hot time in the old town... * [men muttering] [grunts] Old man: It was mid-August 1919. I was young and I thought I was tough, and I knew it was beautiful. And I was a little bit crazy, but hadn't noticed it yet. We were the summer crew. Close one. Mr. McBride and his redheaded son worked at different ranches in the Bitterroot Valley and were saving up for their own place. Mr. Smith had been a miner all his life, and naturally was our powder man. You get headaches touching your face after touching dynamite. Dynamite made me sick, and it must have been why Mr. Smith had such terrible problems with his health. [coughing] The one we called Canada wore this first pair of horn-rimmed glasses I ever saw. He'd been in His Majesty's Royal something or other, and had been gassed in the trenches. The way he treated animals was kinder than any man I ever knew, except for Bill Bell, the head ranger of the Elk Summit district of the Selway forest, and rumored to be the toughest man in the Bitterroot Valley, and, we thought, the best ranger in the forest service. [man coughing] [men chattering] I'd worked for Bill for three summers, and even though he was my model and an artist, maybe because he was, at 17, something in me was half-looking for trouble with him. Cut your fuse too short? Might've. - Dangerous. - Yeah, dangerous. - Yeah. - Mm-hmm. 'Nuff said. Yeah. - Mr. McBride? - Yes, sir, Bill? A good morning's work. Thank you. That's enough blasting for today. You put any chicken in there? I'm hungry. What do we got? Let's look to the other side first. I'll get the other side. Don't worry about it. Mac: Ask you a question, Bill? Never hurt. What are we doing here? It's just a trail. How come they want it so wide? They going to build a railroad through here? You don't get to be a district ranger by asking the United States Forest Service how come. You ask them how far. Yeah, you ask them how far. I've known artists in my time. Writers, painters, piano players. When it comes to packing a mule, that man ranks right up there. Right up there with bloody Mozart. Seems to know what he's doing. Know what he's doing? Mac, to take a packstring of half a hundred across the Bitterroot divide without a pack shifting or the slightest chafe, that is a masterpiece of the highest order. If my number's up tomorrow, at least I can say I rode with Bill Bell and I saw it done. Man: Going to be heading down into Hamilton tomorrow, Bill? Yep. Time to start looking for my dog. Be back in a couple of days. Payroll in hand? Yeah, payroll? It's okay. He knows. I bet you I could walk it in a day, all the way to Hamilton and still have daylight leftover. Is that a fact? Yep. That's a fact. I almost forgot what Hamilton looks like. There's a bank at one end that doles it out. Hotel girls and tinhorn gamblers at the other, always ready to take it away. They got a soda fountain there. Ice cream soda. Gosh, that would taste great right about now. Sure need something to wash down this cooking. What do you got against the cook, anyway? Last year Mac was Bill's fair-haired boy. This year the ranger's found a new favorite. That about it, Mac? No, that's not it. Yeah, that's not it. No, no, no. Why would I have anything against the cook? [men laughing] Why would I have anything against anybody who's going around in an old girl's tennis shoes? The fact was, everything they said was true. I was jealous of the cook. I disliked him and I didn't have a reason. When you're young you just know things, and I knew this cook was a forty-cent piece. Who's winning? [men chattering] Eight. Ten. Oh, yeah, Bill. All you got to do is peg eight there. You mind, Red? Sorry. No harm meant. 17. 19. 27. 29. 30. 31 for two, and a pair is four. 15 two, 15 six, 15 two, 15 four, 15 six, and a pair is eight. Hold on, Bill. That's not an eight hand. A pair of eights and a seven is 15 two, 15 four, and pair of six. It's an eight. It's only a six hand. Right you are. It's a six. I already told you it was a six hand. He's an expert. I deal, right? Hey, Mr. Expert! How about a little three-hand nickel and dime game? Poker, pinochle, you name it. Come on. What do you say? I say what I always say, I don't play cards against the men I work with. And what I say, if there's an expert around, he owes it to the others to teach them a thing or two. Right. Personally, I could never see the sense in playing cards. Me neither. Too many ways of counting. I say what I always say. I never plays cards against the men that I work with. So much for today. Big day tomorrow. Yep. Cards are for playing when you've got nothing better to do. What do you know? Another expert! - Night, men. - Night, y'all. - Night, y'all. - Good night. - Night! - Mr. Hawkes. Red: Whoa! Look at the stars! McBride: Come on, son. Morning comes early. Let's go. You mind getting a little kindling for the stove? I think I'm going to need it tonight. [chattering continues] Make some coffee. It's cold out here. Mac. I don't want you riling the cook. 'Nuff said? I'm not going to rile him. Someday I'm just going to punch the prune juice out of him. Not in this district, you're not. Shut your mouth, Mac. Shut your stupid mouth before you go and say something stupid. What's that? I said who says I'm going to stay in this district! - Morning. - Morning. [horn honks] [man yelling in Chinese] [speaking Chinese] Man: How you doing, Ned? - An ice cream soda. - What flavor you going to have? - Chocolate. - Coming right up. I can take that for you, sir. - Thank you, son. - You're welcome. Put him out back, Jake. He gets lonesome if he don't see them mountains. [men chattering] Man: How you doing, Bill? Bill: Pretty good. Give me a beer. We thought that was your horse outside the drugstore. I must give off a scent or something when I come to town. What do you say to a few hands of poker, Bill? No thanks. I'm still growing the hide you skinned off of me last time. Have you boys seen my dog around town? Not so far this year. On the house, Bill. Keep the change. Sure. Thanks, Bill. Lose your dog, did you? I just don't know what sheep herder she got herself hooked up with this season. Run off on you? She just loves chasing coyotes. I'll be back down in a couple weeks. Anybody brings her in, I'd appreciate you getting me word. I don't see the sense of you toting payroll up the mountains every month. The boys can't come to town and spend it. They just like the feel of it, I guess. Forest Service. Nothing to do but collect your government pay. Bill: Yep, only got to fight fires, clear trails, string line, cruise timber, chase poachers. Just kill time... till we can come into town for a modest meal and a hot bath. Man: Forest Service. Every year. Excuse me, boys. That will be 75 cents. He put some kind of cheese on it. I hate cheese. It's still 75 cents. Tell Wong to put it in our account. That's fine for Wong, but you got no account with me. Here you go. Something for your hope chest, little lady. Running sandwiches to you gentlemen is going to make me rich in no time. [laughter] [man snoring] [snoring continues] Wakey-wakey. Rise and shine! The sea is calm and the day is fine! I'm awake. I'm awake. You don't have to do that. [men muttering] The important thing? Not to cut your throat. Not to cut the throat. Hey, Mac. You happen to see the stars last night? No. What a beautiful sight they were. Morning, Mac. Morning. Pull the skin tight. Come from underneath. Hey. Come on. Come on. You got a headache again? Yeah. I told you about touching your fingers to dynamite, and then your mouth. Yeah, yeah. You told me. It's not an old wives' tale. I've been a miner all my life. I got to know about something. You made your point. You ask me, you're getting too cocky for your own good. [muttering] Dry off, Mac. We got a mountain to blow up. Footwork, footwork. Watch your feet. Put your hands-- That's it. Okay-- [men chattering] There's no future in this end of the job. You can see where I've come. What you ought to do is stick with Bill. Learn the fine art of packing and you got a future. Man: Future, that would be nice. Mud. Get a good clean breath with a new set of lungs. I got it. That's yours. Nothing moves in these mountains without a packer. Nothing moves without the packer. That's a fact, Mac. Is that a fact? Nothing? Wait a minute. - What are you doing? - Use the whistle. What happened to the whistle? Not healthy using my fingers. Holy mackerel! - Run! - Let's go! Come on! Go. Come on, hurry up! Go, run! Mac, I think I ought to tell you what it's like to be 65 years old. Why's that? Because you ain't never going to make it. Red: That's for sure. Never going to make it. McBride: Not unless you learn to set a fuse. Hey, Mac! Isn't it your turn to go down for the lunch? Bill's not going to like that. That's for sure. Not going to like it for one bit. Mr. Hawkes, why don't you stay and eat with us? Things to do. Well, now, Edna, how you feeling? In the pink, huh? How do you know that one's Edna? 'Cause the other one is wearing tennis shoes. [men chuckling] I guess the other one's wearing tennis shoes. That's a good one. Let's go. Come on. Come on. I wouldn't go repeating that back in camp. I don't suppose Old Tennis Shoes even heard it. Ranger wants you back in camp! Uh-oh! [laughter] Going someplace? Lookout on Grave Peak quit this morning. Oh, yeah? Came down off that mountain in three jumps. Know what he said? No. Put his hand on his bed, pulled back the blanket, and took hold of a rattlesnake. You believe that? No, I don't believe that. It's too high up there for rattlesnakes. Why don't you go up on lookout for a couple of weeks and find out? Why you sending me, Bill? If you spot any lightning fires, call them in., 'Cause of the cook, right? I'm exiled. Count your thousands. Each one is a fifth of a mile. Less than a fifth, you better duck and pray for rain. Get a big storm up there or snow, close up camp and come back to the station. You still think about that fire we fought up in Coeur d'Alene? Nope. Not at all. No more bad dreams? How did you know that? I hear things. - Well? - Well, what? Well, 'nuff said. Better take your spikes, your gun. Why don't you ask the cook to make you a sandwich? It will be dark by the time you get to the peak. Not unless I walk backward. I'll last till I get there. Anyway, I can eat better with a can opener. Take some water. Water makes you sick on the trail. Who told you that? Nobody. It happened to me one time, so I oughta know. [panting] Peak before dark. Peak before dark. "Better ask the cook. 'Nuff said." "It will be dark..." Rattlesnake my... Northern place... "See queer sights... "But the queerest they ever did see, "was the night on the marsh, "of the Lake LaBarge, "when I cremated Sam McGee." [thunder] Peak before dark. Peak before dark. [sighs] [men chattering] I'll show you this. Look. Put your hand-- put your finger. See? Look. [thunder] [phone ringing] [ringing continues] Hello? Mac: Just checking in. I'm at Grave Peak. You made good time considering the weather. Nothing to it. I can outwalk anybody in the Forest Service. You got me believing it. Everything okay up there? Everything looks perfect. Not too wet for you? Summer mist, that's all. Don't let it get you down. You couldn't have done me a bigger favor, Bill. I'd be afraid to pray for this kind of job for fear it was simple to have it this good. That's a load off my mind. Good. So long, Mac. So long, Bill. He'll live, if he's not struck dead for lying. [chattering] [distant thunder] One thousand one, one thousand two, one thousand three, one thousand four-- [thunder] * My baby, when you hear the bells go ding-a-ling * * All join round, sweetly hear you sing * * When you get that rhythm * You're gonna shout and sing * * They'll be a hot time in the old town tonight * Not sending me up here to stare at mountains for two weeks as some sort of punishment, eh? Well, the joke's on you, Mr. District Ranger. I'm tough enough to take it. Don't you worry. I'm tough enough. Old Mac: Even at that age, I already knew mountains lived and moved. Long before, when I had a child's sickness, my mother put me outside in a bed with mosquito netting over it, and I lay there watching the mountains until they made me well. That's why I knew then, when I was 17, that when needed, mountains would move for me. [moaning] [flames crackling, men shouting] [shouting intensifies] [shouting continues] Man: We're surrounded! The fire's all around us! [flames roar] One thousand one, one thousand two, one thousand three, one thousand fo-- [thunder] No, just the usual afternoon lightning. Bill: Count your thousands? Yeah, I counted off the distances. Nothing started smoking. Do you need anything? - Nope. - Sure? Yeah, I'm fine. Fine. Well, so long, Mac. So long. Hold still. Hold still. I'm trying to look. Boy, I wouldn't want to be Mac out there in this storm. That's what tents are for. Smith: Of course, tents work best if they're still standing. I've known winds to hit 80 miles an hour up on Grave Peak. 80 mi-- Oh, yeah. 80 plus. - That much? - Mm-hmm. [clacking] Stop fooling with that cribbage board! I suppose if Mac were running into any trouble, he'd call in, huh? Bill: It's what the phone line is for. That's what they're for, all right. [wind howling] [hissing] That's it. All yours. No more. Old Mac: I kept telling myself that I had slipped dynamite, fought a big fire, carried a gun, helped Bill pack, watched mountains by myself, and that was a summer's work, so I should just get my time and quit. What I neglected to tell myself is that it's almost impossible to quit a ranger who's sore because you do not like his cook. And I also had the feeling that he was watching me somehow, just to see if I'd duck out when things got tough. [panting] "Was the night on the marsh "of Lake LaBarge..." "Was the night on the marsh of Lake LaBarge, "when I cremated Sam McGee." Okay. Okay. 'Nuff said. [grunts] Whoa! Ooh! Ooh! Ow! [grunting] That's it. That's it. Time to quit. Time to quit. That's it. Time to quit. Some reason you're standing there? Why, it rained. Uh, snow was coming. I could tell the season's pretty near over. Did you get a message from somebody it was getting ready to snow? Well, it rained and blew, and I could tell snow was coming. Maybe you ought to transfer over to the weather bureau. There are rattlers up there. Did you have a run-in with one? No, the wire was down. Spikes didn't hold. Listen, Bill, I've been thinking-- Me, too. I've been thinking. Yeah, but I-- The trail crew's been getting along good without you. And as you say, it's near the end of the season. I could use somebody around here to help me get the gear together. How about a game of cribbage tonight? I guess I could stay on a day or two more and help out. You weren't thinking about quitting, were you? Over a measly rattlesnake? Heck no. Over some stupid rattler? What gave you that idea? Good. Be a shame to quit at this stage of the game, just when things were about to get interesting. 15 two, and 3 threes are six, for eight, and I am out. Three down 3 is a nine. No. Bill, 3 threes are just three of a kind. A pair counts two. A three of a kind of anything counts six. Six. [men chattering] Just wanted to make sure you didn't forget how to count. Another game? Nothing like a little time on lookout to make a station-cooked meal taste good, huh? That what you think? Easy now, Mac. I got a better idea. Hawkes, drop those eggs, and come join Bill and me in a game of poker. Season's near over, and the three of us have never sat down to a game. How many times do I have to tell you? I don't play cards against the men I work with. Why don't you show him why you don't play cards with the men you work with? Sit down. [men muttering] [laughter] Let's play poker. [muttering continues] Cut. - What's he doing? - I don't know. Man: He's splitting them up. Man 2: I never seen anybody deal that fast. [laughter] Hawkes: Play your hands. All right, what have we got here? Holy-- Four tens! - I got four queens! - Jacks! Good hand, Red. That takes it all. I bet I win. [laughter] - How did he do it? - Unbelievable. The man's a cardsharp, boys. Still want to play poker? [laughter] A real artiste. Hawkes: I'll tell you once and for all about my card play. I play cards for a living. I have to get out in the summer because of my health. But I need to keep my hands soft, so I cook and I wash dishes instead of doing trail work. I practice every night before I go to sleep, and that's why I never play cards against the men that I work with. [laughter] Just as well, huh, Mac? That would have been a long summer. Man: Look at Mac's eyes. [harmonica playing] Count your blessings, Mac. The cook could've picked you clean all summer. Something about this cook business doesn't add up. I think Bill's got something up his sleeve. That's what I think. What do you think, Mac? Red, let me ask you. Have you ever once in your whole life had one single solitary original thought that didn't bounce off from somewhere else? I mean, have you ever sat down, considered all the available information, weighed it all in your mind, sifted all the possibilities, discarded what you couldn't prove, sorted out what made sense, and came to your own personal, original Red McBride opinion? Why would I go to all that trouble? Good night, son. Good night, Pa. Hi. Hey, fellas. What's going on? Man: Wow. [coughs] Shh. Man: Ooh! [muttering] Mac: Mr. McBride thinks you've got something up your sleeve. Well, do you? Bill: Ranger's revenge. How? Where? The end of every season, those tinhorn gamblers at the Oxford strip me clean. Well, I don't suppose it's a big secret in the district that you aren't, well, a real whiz-bang at the cards. It's a sure enough secret that the cook is. That's why I'm betting my whole bankroll on him. I'm leaving it up to you to get the rest of the crew to chip in and help fatten up the cook's playing money. Me? They know how you feel about the cook. Bound to go along if they see you bet on him. My wages on him? He'll win big. Real big. When that time comes, you pick up the money. Use a bag or something. Bill, I don't know if I deserve to have such a key part in this. Ranger knows his men. But does he know one of them, namely me, isn't too keen about getting his head punched in? Those tinhorns are pantywaists when it comes to shedding any blood. What a relief. Better take your gun just in case. Holy Moses, Bill. I got nothing but that .32-20 on a .45 frame. That's as big as horse artillery. I'd be arrested before I got in the bar. You decide, then. Either way, I'll cover you. Cover me? What's that supposed to mean, "Cover me"? What is that, Bill? All you got to do is concentrate on scooping that money into the bag. Make it a sugar bag. Sort of sweet justice. [chuckling] I'm counting on you, Mac. I don't know, Bill. I don't go in too much for getting the stuffing beat out of me. I told you, I'll cover you. Yeah, but what I'm saying is that-- 'Nuff said. I wonder if the United States Forest Service has any idea why their crews have such an appetite for peaches. [men laughing] Man: This is good stuff! - Oh, that's right! - Yeah! [men chattering] Old Mac: Bill had explained the ranger's revenge to the crew, but they hadn't warmed to the idea of backing Hawkes anymore than I had. The fact was, they'd rather darn socks than lose a dime. So Bill and I both knew that it was up to me to talk them into it. Here he comes! [cheering] - Bitterroot beer. - Be careful there. Drink up! You guys want some more of that? Not too much for the young lad there. There you go. Time for celebration. [groans] That's good, huh? Boys, here we are at the end of the season. Yeah. You all know what I got in mind. What's that, Bill? [laughing] No doubt there is risk involved, financial and otherwise. Got to make up your own minds. In or out? It's up to you. Mac? Well, you all know how I feel about Mr. Hawkes. Yeah, we sure do. Yeah, sure do. Make it plain every day. I'm not about to let that get in the way of good business. I'm in for half a month's pay. [murmuring] I believe in that boy. He's going to go far, and I'm going to go with him all the way to the bank. The last time I volunteered-- well, it didn't work out so good. - Come here, Red. - Okay, what? Fix bayonets, boys. We're going over the top. Yeah, we're in! You ain't keeping Red and me out. We're gonna clean out that town. How much we going to make, Mac? How much you figure? Man: What do you figure, Mac? Man 2: Come on, Mac. I figure we should each clear a summer's wages. - Ooh! - A summer's wages? At least. Maybe more. More? We better practice up for Hamilton! We're going to clean out that town! - Yeah! - Woo-hoo-hoo! McBride: I never knew a summer crew worth its salt that didn't clean out the town at the end of the season. Red: Including them women and girls at the hotel! [men chattering] [snoring] What are you doing? Going to set a record. All the way to Hamilton in one day. Are you crazy? What for? I need a little local fame. Always took you for smarter. Nobody's perfect, except maybe Hawkes. Oh, I see. You're going to kill yourself because you're jealous of a two-bit cardsharp. Packing's a pipe dream, powder makes me sick, so it's got to be the walking. [coughs] You're not proving anything to anybody. Just to me. Didn't you ever do that? Mac, it's 14 miles up to the Bitterroot divide before you even start down. And it's another 14 miles just to the mouth of Blodgett Canyon. That ain't even the hard part. Some people play cards better than others, me, I can outwalk any man in the district. Even if you make it, they're apt to bury you for dead when you get there. Not this boy. Saturday night I need you alive and well in Hamilton. Saturday night in Hamilton. Nothing to it. Bill: You got plenty of water? I told you, it makes me sick. How'd you ever live this long? I'm a Presbyterian! [grunts] Oh, gee. No, no, no. No cramps. No, no, no. 'Nuff said. I got to go. I got to go. Saturday night. Hamilton. Saturday night. Hamilton. Saturday night. In Hamilton. Saturday night. [muttering] Start to stop and swear... And what did that-- Whoa! Aah! [coughing] 'Nuff said. One more rise. One more rise. You can do it. It's just over the hill. You can do it. Almost there. Hamilton, just over the rise. They moved it. They moved it. 52, 54, 56, 58... 50-10, 50-12. Can't drink. Can't drink. 'Nuff said. Can't drink. From time to time, I thought I was on the fire line, and that the sky was swirling with burning cones, and that the universe was upside down with Hell above. School, school. Money, money. I'll cover you, cover you, cover you. Sugar bag... Vanilla. Vanilla. [Mac panting] Yellow. Hmm? Lemon. Coming right up. Chocolate. What's the matter with you? Chocolate. I don't believe you should have another. Walked it-- one day. All the way. [chattering] Oh. How are you today, sir? You got a problem? You smell. What did you say? I smell? Nice. Yeah, well, why don't you just order? I'll give you a minute. [men chattering in Chinese] You ready? Dirty. Me? Oh. In the back. You ready to order now? No, I'm ready to order now. I see. Do you know what you want? Mmm. No? Okay, how about the chicken chow mein? That would be just fine. We've got some different kinds of chop suey. That would be just fine. How about chicken chow mein suey chopped? That would be just fine. I'll bring you some soup to start. That would be just fine. Are you okay? Just fine. I need the check. But you haven't even eaten yet. Please, have the check. I love you. [chattering] Well, well, well. You sure gave us a scare there, young fella. Got to stay alive. You'll live, all right, if you lay off of ice cream sodas after exertions. Saturday night. Hamilton. This here is Hamilton, but it ain't Saturday. I recommend you get some sleep till it is. Hey, no charge for the soup. Get out of the way. Man: I want you to come see me in my office in the morning. You hear? You don't come tomorrow, I'm going to charge you for tonight. If you come tomorrow, I won't charge you for tonight or tomorrow. Just want to know if you're okay. You see that he gets there. Me? I don't even know him. Well, you better get him to the hotel. That place? Don't worry. He's in no condition to fall into sin. [groans] The only men on God's green Earth dumber about cards than a sheep herder is Bill Bell and his summer crew of Forest Service boys. They can't shuffle, they can't deal, they can't count. My how I love them. They're not going to like being separated from a summer's pay. They'll see red. They'll want blood. I'll lay odds on that. Bound to be fighting. Bound to be. I don't tangle myself. It's bad for the fingers. Yeah, that's right. You got to watch it. Yeah, tangling is bad for the fingers. That's why I favor surprise. [men laughing] You keep your gun handy. Yes, sir. [laughter continues] [music playing, women laughing] - Woman: Give me my money. - Man: I said no. - You promised it to me! - No, it's enough for you. - No, it's not. - Enough! Woman: You didn't give me anything! Man: No, that's what I said. I am a businessman. Woman: You call yourself a businessman? Man: Yes! - It's mine! - No! - I earned it! - I said no. Woman: You owe me that money. You promised it to me. - We made a deal! - That's it! I said no. Woman: Give me my money! I set him up. I deserve my cut. I am a businessman. You are cheese for a trap. Woman: You're a two-bit cheapskate, that's what you are. You're a no-good showgirl with nothing to show. Hey, hey, hey. Not too fast, buster. Five bucks... [chattering, woman laughing] How do you do? Go back to bed, cowboy. You deaf? Woman: Hey, that's mine! He gave it to me! Man: Ladies, please! Now there's enough for all of you. All right, again. Good. Come on, give me a big one. Uh-huh. Well, you walked too far, you got too hot, you probably didn't drink anything to boot. Well, of course. All of your blood was on the outside of you, in your legs, in your arm muscles. You drank them two ice cream sodas. They was cold, of course. The blood rushed inside you, left your head empty, and then you fainted. I haven't ever known anybody who fainted before. - I thought only wome-- - What was that? Nothing, nothing. Here, I want you to take these, right, and get out of here. I've got people waiting outside with things a lot worse than ice cream soda disorders. Get! You boys listen to your mama, now. [boys arguing] You are pretty big for fainting. Maybe you got a heart condition. I don't think so. Pretty sure of yourself, are you? You're quite outspoken for a girl. It helps people avoid stepping on you. I can see that it might. It does. It's not a bad feature to have. Especially if you have freckles. You do have a few, don't you? I don't discuss my skin coloration with strangers. The name's Mac. Sue. Do you mind if I ask you, do you have a bag you can spare? A sugar bag, maybe? Okay, come on. Listen, I might as well tell you before you find out the hard way. The boys at the Oxford are laying for Bill Bell and his crew. I don't know any boys at the Oxford. Yeah, well, you could do Bill Bell a favor. Tell him he could be in big trouble if he takes up a deck of cards in his hands. I figure Bill Bell is a man capable of taking care of himself. Like all you men, right? [women chattering] Are you from Hamilton? No, Darby. I ran away with the intention of getting to Missoula, but this is as far as I got. I'm from Missoula. [chattering] I figured you were from the big city. I guess passing out like that is about the oddest thing I've ever done. Not quite. You also said you love me. I don't hold sick people to their word, so don't worry about it. You're pretty smart for being from Darby. Just you wait till I get to Missoula. Thanks for helping me. You're welcome. Hey, you remember what I said about the Oxford. I got better things to do than to play nurse. But you should come by for a hamburger later. You'll need some meat to strengthen you up. How did you do? Made it. [men laughing] Man: I guess he got that local fame he was wanting. [laughter continues] Hey, Red, come on, let's go. Man: Hey, Mac, how you doing? Hey, Mac. Listen, we're one crew, but let's don't stand around together in one bunch until we get to the Oxford. What time you want us there, Bill? I say start drifting in between 9:30 and 10:00. Mr. Smith, I want you to hang in the doorway, take care of whatever comes in from the bar side. Right you are. Anything goes wrong, Mac will scoop up the money, I'll cover him. Rest of you help out wherever we're hurting. Other than that, let's don't make too many plans. One or two wouldn't hurt. Okay, let me go over the rules. Except for one or two hands a night, I'm a percentage player. I'm a very good percentage player, so I'll probably be ahead. But if I'm not, don't lose patience. They'll be one big hand. Just be ready. One very big hand. Those are rules? You heard him. McBride: I'm for a sip of something we didn't percolate ourselves. What do you say, men? Raises the spirits, dulls the pain, God save the king. God save the king! Man: Here we go! Hey, you! Kid, where do you think you're going? I've got some friends in there. Come here. What do you want? I'm looking for Bill Bell. You work for him? That's right. He's back there. What's he doing back there? Why don't you go back and find out? You got the bag? The bartender's got a gun. There's ways around that. [men chattering] Ante up, ante up. Oh, Mr. Hawkes, try and speed up, will you? Man: I'll raise you a dollar. [coins clink on table] Man 2: I see that. Man: Feeling lucky? Hawkes: Darn, I can't possibly-- No, I should drop out. Look, mister, when you ain't got 'em, you pretend you have them. When you have got 'em, you pretend you ain't. I read you like a book. Now bet or fold. Yeah. Guess I may as well. Three boys. Ooh, that's a big hand. Like I figured, got me beat. Pair of queens. Old Mac: For my money, he was too flashy and showing off. But our crew was proud of him, and standing right over him as if I owned him, I guess I was, too, although never completely losing the feeling that something was missing in him somewhere. Man: You sure deal pretty slowly. I told you, boys. I told you I had a flush going in. [crowd murmuring] I'll open for a dollar. Staying in. I think these are worth it. I'll raise a dollar. No, how about five? - [crowd murmuring] - Five dollars? Give me two cards. I'm playing these. Give me three. Dealer takes three. I beg your pardon, but I like to see a man's face when I play cards with him. [crowd murmuring] [chuckles] Cost you five more dollars to stay in. Make it ten. [murmuring continues] Uh-unh. Sorry, partner, but I do believe you're going to have to throw away your hand. I do believe, you've got an extra card. Who, me? Yeah, you. You got six cards in your hand. You must have had that extra card up your sleeve just waiting for a big pot like this one. Sorry, I don't think I heard you just right. Yeah, you did. I said you got six cards in your hand. Count 'em. How many? How many? 1, 2, 3, 4... 5. And if you're looking for that extra card you dealt me to get me out of the game, you'll find it in your dealer's hatband. Man: What in the world? The cook had gone too far and shown off, and now everybody knew what he was and why he was there, especially Bill, who looked at me and I knew it was 'nuff said. [honkytonk playing] [shouting] Get off! * You are mine, I love you best of all * * And be my man, or I'll have no man at all * * There'll be a hot time in the old town tonight * * When you hear those bells go ding-a-ling * - Nice hook, son. - Thanks, Pa. * All join round, and sweetly you must sing * I knew it. Drop the money, kid! Help me! * Hot time in the old town tonight... * [man scatting] * Please, oh, please * Do not let me fall * You are mine, I love you best of all * * He will be my man, or I'll have no man at all * * There'll be a hot time in the old town tonight * * There'll be a hot time in the old town tonight * Come on, tough guy. Come on. * There'll be a hot time in the old town tonight * [coughing] Up you get, Mac. It's over. Red, Red! Whoa, it's me, Pa! Red, come on! Let's go. It's over. Come on, Red, Red. Come on, it's okay. Are you all right, honey? You want me to get you a drink? [men shouting] Let go! Let go of me! Let go. Man: Is my lip bleeding? Is my lip bleeding? Man 2: Oh! I can't see! Okay. Okay, boys. I'm going to count it. No, no, that's all right, Bill. Let Mr. Smith count it. All right. Not counting what you invested, earnings come to, per man, about $7.20 each. - $7.00? - And 20 cents? You sure? $7.20 is a big night's work. $14.40 for you and me. Hey, Mac, you did real good. You came right through in the trenches. - You sure did, Mac. - That's for sure, Mac. Good going! Oh, sorry. Red. I didn't mean to hit you so hard. You're a real good fighter. Thanks, Mac. - He is, really. - That's true, son. [chattering] Come back here tomorrow afternoon and help me pack up. Oh, no, no, no. The night is but a pup! - Oh, yeah! - Okay! See-- - Whoa, whoa! - Pick him up. [all shushing] Red: $7.20. Not bad for a night's work. Whoo! Man: Red, stop that. [chattering] Man: Hold on to your feathers, ladies. [women giggle] - Bye, Wong. - See you next time. Heard about last night. I'll take that hamburger now. Oh, oh! Be a wonder if you don't go deaf in this ear. What? Not that you listen out of it much anyway. I told you to be careful. Here, hold this. I've never spent so much time tending to the infirmities of one person in my whole life. Well, I've seen better, but it'll have to do. Thanks. I really do appreciate it. Honest. I wouldn't have done it unless I was more than willing. Before I forget, there's a friend of yours out in the alley. He looks even worse than you do. Well, you better show me. [bell tolling] I offered to help him, but he told me to get away. You picked the last guy in the world to help this bird. Hey. What happened? I'm broke. You? An expert? A true artiste, broke? How's that possible? They rolled me. That spindly little showgirl with nothing to show. [laughs] Need some money. Get to Butte. Loan me $10.00. I'll tell you what... I'll give you my $7.20 of winnings. That will get you a ticket back home. I don't want it back. I'll pay you back. Never mind about that. All right. Thanks. So what do you think, huh? What do you think? About what? Do you think you might ever make it back this way? I wouldn't be surprised. Ready? It's been a pretty good crew this summer. Did what they had to do... loved the woods without thinking they own them... Every man good at one thing or another... swinging a jackhammer, fighting fires, loved to fight... good with tools and knots, liked to work. If you think about it, that's a lot to say about a bunch of men. Yes, it is. There he is, girl. Go on. Go on, now. There's that old dog. [dog barks] Thanks, Bill. She's a good one. Come here, girl. Whoa, it's my girl! There's my girl. You catch any coyotes this summer? Did you? Did you? That a girl. Yeah. That was a fair thing you did for the cook. Yeah, well... So, you going to come work for me next summer? Spare chance of making a ranger out of you yet. Sure. It's a deal. It's a deal, then. I'll write you in the spring. Deal. Be seeing you. Me, too. Come on, girl. - [whistles] - [dog barks] Old Mac: I watched Bill Bell and his horse and that old dog who loved catching coyotes, and then he turned in his saddle and raised up that hat he always wore and gave me a big wave. And I stood on the middle rail of the corral and gave him a big wave back. I had no way of knowing that particular afternoon, but I was never to cross the Bitterroot Mountains again, and I was never to see Bill Bell or any of the other men again. I have a feeling Bill Bell might have guessed that when he rode off. Everything that was going to happen, had happened. Everything that was to be seen was gone. My summer with the ranger and the cook had all disappeared into that gigantic hole in the sky. I think the answer had something to do with my becoming 18 the next summer. The wind sort of shifted in my life. I started wishing that freckled girl Sue might just show up in Missoula, things like that. I was very conscious of becoming 18.
