(acoustic piano music) - Time is an illusion. We think of past, present, and future as separate things but they're not. It's all one. So when we depart from this strange world it means nothing. We may not be here but we're still there. Just as we were. - Einstein. - As well as I can remember. - What are you gonna do with your life? You're gonna go to college get a job, blah blah blah. But what are you gonna do? - What that's not enough? - That's not anything. - So what are you gonna do? - Head East. - Then what? - Well New York eventually but it's not the destination that intrigues me. - Tell me about John Foster. We know you were living together. Tax returns. - He had tinnitus. It must have been excruciating for him. The constant ringing in his ears. (high pitched ringing) But he never complained and that was-- - Difficult? - Endearing. - God that sounds so stupid. All those years we were together and I talk about his tinnitus. - [Cassie] It's romantic is what it is. - Romantic? - You know Kerouac and Steinbeck. At least I have direction. - It's literally a direction. I'll give you that. - Better directing myself toward the nearest douche bag with muscles. - That's... ...mildly unfair. - Hey you have a type. - Okay. - And that type is douche bag. - I'm gonna do better in college. - I can't wait to see that. Tent. - You could come with me you know. - East coast, no. - Not forever, just a trip. I'll get you back in time for college. - You take that junky old Taurus more than a hundred miles in any direction and it's gonna be a one way trip. - So what? Life's a one way trip. - Wow, deep. - You're deep. - You're scared. - Hardly. - You're scared of change, scared of school, scared of not being the smartest person in the room. - Can't be scared of the impossible. - You're scared of being alone. - So come with me. - [Interviewer] Tell me about the woman. - The woman? - The other... - You know the funny thing about time travel? We do it every day. Our memory takes us into the past. Our imagination takes us into the future. You don't need to build a machine. - But memory, imagination, they're just an exercise in thought. You're not really there. - And you think you're really here? That's just your mind playing tricks. - But I am here. - Sure but you're also there aren't you? Everywhere you've ever been. - So come with me. - [Zelda] And everywhere you'll ever be. - I have to run out you okay with locking up? - Yep. - Thanks see you tomorrow. - [Zelda] Goodbye Walter. - [Cassie] Well hey there stranger. - [Zelda] Cassie. - Is a hug out of the question? - Yeah, no come here. Oh you finally got a tattoo. - Got a bunch actually. These were my first. They were very meaningful to 19 year old me. - So how's New York? - New York? - Wasn't that your big plan, head East? I just always assumed-- - Yeah well truth be told I made it as far as Las Vegas. - Seriously? - I know. - Las Vegas? - My car broke down. By the time I got a new one. - You'd already found adventure. - Something like that. - I told you that Taurus wouldn't make it 100 miles. - Well it made it 300 so. - Where it died in Vegas. - Womp womp. - So I'm off the clock if you want a go for a walk or something. - How about a drive? - I'd love to. Just let me lock up. (upbeat music) - So a book store? - Yeah. - Sounds thrilling. Well I hope this isn't too exciting for you. Don't worry it's gonna be fun. - What? - Just trust me okay. (suspenseful music) - [Scientologist] You're back. - I'm back. This is the friend I was telling you about. - Nice to meet you. Please come. (suspenseful music) I'll be back when it's over to answer any questions. - So you didn't come back after 15-- - It's starting. - [Video] Man. His basic purpose? Survive! - I wonder what woman's basic purpose is. - I know it's great, right? - [Video] But is mere survival the goal to which we aspire? - I'll be right back. - Wait, serious? - [Video] You must ask yourself. - Enjoy. - [Video] Do you want your life to be good? Or something greater? If greatness is something that can be achieved. (suspenseful music) These things are secret to the human mind. But they do not have to be. (suspenseful music) It took courage for man to stop-- (suspenseful music) You're ready for your life to me more than merely good. If you think greatness is a means to be achieved. Than perhaps man is ready to begin. - Let's go. Wow wow wow wow. Man, that is a lot to take in. We're gonna go for a drive and talk it over. - I have pamphlets. (suspenseful music) - What the hell was that? - [Cassie] Here. - What the hell is this? - Buckle up, I'll show you. (dramatic music) I'm home. - Can I see it? - Zelda you remember Dave right. - I suppose you get to read a lot of books you get to rewrite-- - No but you're wrong. - No I'm not I know that I know it's a noun. - You know that you know it. - But it matters right? And I can give you-- - Yeah we had English together. What are we doing at Dave Belsky's apartment? - [Cassie] I'm living here. - It's good. - Yeah Dave hired me for a job. - You're back in LA for a job? - Well yeah. What did you think I came back here just for you? - Well no but. - You did. You totally did. Oh no no. - The guidance circuitry it checks out with my grandfathers notes. - Would someone please just tell me why I'm standing in Dave Belsky's apartment with a stolen doo dad? - Not a doo dad. - Whatever. - This is the guidance component for-- - Why do we have it? - My grandfather died a year ago. When I was going through his stuff I found this. What you need to know about my grandpa was that he was in the psych ward since before I was born. So my whole life I thought he was a nut. But this tells a different story. If this is true then in 1960 he was awarded a research grant from the Department of Defense. Sold them the idea of ending a war before it began. They were thinking of the Russians of course. But grandpa had other ideas. (dramatic music) (machine rattling) (gun firing) (machine rattling) (dramatic music) He kept it a secret of course. He knew the government would never risk losing global superiority even if it meant saving 11 million lives, and he was right. He had an assistant who betrayed him. Told the government what he was planning to do. When the government found out they took everything or so they thought. Grandpa managed to sneak the guidance component out of the lab and hide it away just before they did the same to him. But even though the government has had the machine for 50 years they haven't been able to do anything with it 'cause they don't have this. - A time machine? - Yeah. - Your grandfather built a time machine. - Yes. - So what that's it? That's your grandpa's time machine? - No this is the guidance component. We still need the battery and the time travel apparatus. My grandfather's notes tell us where to find the battery. But in order to find the machine we need a copy of the governments file. - So what you're going to just break into a government file room? - Well one step at a time. The point is I'm helping Dave out, Dave's helping me out. But we could us a third person so think it over? Either way it was great seeing you. - And just drop the mic and leave. Well at least that hasn't changed. - So what do you think? - I think I'm going to call my boyfriend to pick me up. And then I'm going to have a very strong drink. - No I mean you want to help us? - Are you kidding? Are you kidding? It must have fallen out in her car. - Your phone? - Yes Dave my phone. Cassie. She's gone, let me use yours. - My what? - Your phone. - I don't have a phone. - What? - They can track you everywhere you go. - They? - The government. - Alright you are driving me to Cassie. - I don't have a car. - Do you remember me from high school? - Of course. Do you remember me? (babbling) - I remember that you were a jerk. - No I wasn't. That's ridiculous. - Yeah you really were. - How? Does anybody have a dictionary? - You always had to be right. - Oh. Yeah I guess I did. Well I always liked you. I mean not like that but you know. Well maybe a little like that. Doesn't matter. - So you burgle and you bartend. - Actually. - Don't care doesn't matter. Left my phone in your car. (bar music) (phone buzzing) - Hello. - [Zelda] Thanks. - You okay? You want a drink? - Nope. - Dave? - Yeah yeah I'll have another. Thanks. (bar music) So you want to hear how we're gonna get it? - Get what? - The file on Project Cuckoo. - The what? - It's what the government codenamed my grandfathers work. 'Cause they thought he was crazy. Anyhow do you want to hear how we're gonna get it? - Sure. - So Cassie knows this guy back in Vegas. He's sort of a purveyor of government files. - [Zelda] He steals them? - [Dave] Yeah and sells them. - There was a time this was my obsession, my great white whale. The kid tried to steal it from me once and I beat him half to death. So you'll understand my price and why it's not negotiable. 100,000. - Gosh Dave get one drink in you and you're all sorts of gabby. - I was just-- - You're cut off. (babbling) Go. And you, you're not on the hook for anything. If you don't want to be involved. - I don't, in any of it. I mean a time machine? You believe that? - I believe what Dave pays me to believe. And until the money runs out, sure why not? - Dave is paying you? - Weekly retainer. His grandpa left him more than just a ratty old book. (horn honking) - That's me. - You called for attraction? - Well you did kind of kidnap me so. - Hey don't tell your boyfriend about this okay. - Right. - I mean it. Please. - Did you have a good time? - Yeah. - What'd you do? - Just you know caught up. - Fun. - Walter do we have any books on time travel? - Fiction or nonfiction? - There's nonfiction? - [Walter] Read this. - [Zelda Voiceover] Time travel to the future is simple. It just takes patience. But if you want to go backward in time that's a bit more complicated. Why? Because you would have to go faster than light. Photons can do this easily, neutrinos can be convinced. But for anything with mass, be it a person or a tomato, traveling faster than light is impossible. But say you could go back in time. What would you be able to do? Well if you want to change history you're out of luck. Because time is not held captive by our perception of it. We think... We think of past, present, and future... as separate things but they're not. It's all (book thumping) - Good morning. Want some eggs? - Just a coffee if you got it. - Of course. - [Zelda] Thanks, see you this afternoon. - [John] You won't actually, I'm driving out to Vegas. - Vegas? - I'm covering a French food festival. - I'll be gone through the weekend. - Should I come out Saturday? - I'm gonna be pretty busy. - Okay. Have a good trip. - Hi. - Oh. Hi. - I brought you a peace offering. - Were we at war? - Look I'm sorry okay about throwing all that stuff at you. Truth is I-- - Good morning Zelda here's your oh. - Walter this is Cassie we went to high school together. Cassie this is my boss, Walter. - Oh please your colleague. (laughing) (grunts) Zelda when you get a moment I'd like to go over some things with you up front. - [Zelda] Yeah sure I can-- - Oh no no no no take your time there's no rush. I'll be up front. - Oh my God you work for a creeper. - Stop. - He is, he totally has a creepy crush. - Walter's gay. - Did you see the way he looked at you? - He's gay. - Right. (somber music) Well you have my offering of peace. (somber music) It's not the destination that intrigues me. (somber music) (bar music) - Hey. What are you doing here? - Peace offering. - I don't normally drink coffee this close to midnight but. - Ooh sorry I-- - Zelda I'm kidding. - Jimberly, this is Zelda. Zelda this is Jimberly. - It's just Jim. - Hi it's nice to-- - Wet hands. - So this thing with Dave. If he's paying you-- - Speak of the Devil and he shall appear. Dave, you want a drink? - No just a water. - Come on Dave let me buy you a drink. It's the least I can do for the man that's gonna kill Hitler. - I'm not going to kill Hitler. - That's right you're not because you didn't so you won't. - What? - Oh yeah I've been reading up. - What Novikov? - The self-consistency principle. - But that's only if we live in a non branching universe. - Which is the favored hypothesis. - No, there's no favored hypothesis. - Sure there is, you're branching universe-- - It's the most logical approach. - The most logical approach is to look at time for what it is, a four dimensional entity that exists outside your conscious perception. - No because so called self-consistency means there's no free will. - Free will never allowed you to do something physically impossible. If you want to be a tomato the size of the universe no matter how much you hope and try it's not gonna happen. Changing the past is the same thing. If you do travel back in time, even though it's in your subjective future it's in the objective past. So if you could travel back in time and if you were determined to change the past when it came down to it you'd either decide not to or you'd fail. - You have been reading up. - Doesn't mean she knows what she's talking about. - Just stick a knife in his heart why don't you? - What? - Cassie you mind putting up the tea party and helping me out? - Tea party? - There's a line. - There's a lime. - No, a line. - A lime. (Jim growls) (Cassie mocks Jim growling) (both laughing) A couple of teenagers up to no good. You tend to pop out more. - Yeah a couple of times. How old were you when that happened? - 17, 17. - Everybody sang happy birthday. - So cool. That was a good time. - Are you seeing anyone? - Oh Lord, how did we circle around to that subject? - Is that a yes? - That's decidedly a no. - Have you had any companionship? - Are you asking because you really want to know? Or are you just trying to be polite? - I... Polite. - Well I'm not a nun if that's what you're worried about. I've had one or two girlfriends over the years. Plenty of hookups. Just nothing long term. - Do you want that? - Doesn't everyone? - Oh I don't know, big bad cat burglar. Maybe you got other plans. - Right. And truth be told I would love to just work in that bookstore with you. - Really? Wouldn't that bore you to death? - Not if I was the boss man. I mean creepy crush has got to be retiring soon right? - Walter's gay. - You keep telling yourself that. - Do you ever think about that camping trip? - Sure, probably more than I should. - I never apologized. - Are you kidding? You have nothing to apologize for. - You're scared of being alone. - So come with me. - And spend our whole life running away? - Not away just toward something else. - See this is why you need to go to college, so you can meet people, make an actual connection. - I thought that's what I was doing. - Not with me with people. - You are not people? - Romantic type people. - Oh, romantic type people. - You know what I mean, you need too... - Get laid? - Well I wouldn't put it like that. - Oh no you're much to demure to actually say what you mean. Which one of us is the one we can't trust? - What? - You Might be Giants. (gagging) Shut up, they're brilliant. - Have you heard them sing? (crickets chirping) - Don't go. It was just a kiss. I won't do it again. What you're just gonna storm off? Pitch black, middle of the night. I'm not coming after you. - [Zelda] Good. - Yes well, mistakes were made. (acoustic piano music) (phone buzzing) - Hey there. - Hey. How's Vegas? - Loud. - Tinnitus bothering you? - Actually today I'm feeling pretty good about it. What are you up to? - I'm at a bar. Just wanted to hear your voice. - Well I'd like to talk more but deadline you know. - Okay, see you Monday. - Yeah. (acoustic piano music) - Okay so this line-- - Dave that was like an hour ago. - Hey guys got to close up. - Okay. I should get home. - Hang out with Dave for a second. There's something I want to show you. - Okay. - Give me two minutes. - Cassie. - Two minutes. - You really want me to look at your sketches don't you? Fine I'll-- - Get down. - [Jim] And you're gonna mop right? - [Cassie] Yes I'm going to mop. - Alright see you tomorrow. (suspenseful music) - Let's go. - [Zelda] What are you? (suspenseful music) - Alright come on, come on, come on, come on, come on. (suspenseful music) - Where's Dave? What the hell are you doing? - The cameras? - I switched them off. Come on. (suspenseful music) Got the sledge? - Here. - Why does it smell like milk? - I hid it in the trash. - What? - I hid it under the... (suspenseful music) 50 years ago this was not a bar. (sledge hammer smashing) It was my grandfathers lab. (sledge hammer smashing) He built a special battery to power the time machine. (sledge hammer smashing) The government took it, destroyed it probably. (sledge hammer smashing) But what they didn't know is that he built a second one. (sledge hammer smashing) And he hid it in the wall. Smart man my grandpa. - [Jim] Cassie. (suspenseful music) Yo Cassie. - Jimberly, couldn't get enough of me could you? - My phone, I forgot it. What are you doing up here? - Looking for the bleach. - It's down in the mop closet. - Really? I looked. - Right. Stop screwing around and do your job. - [Cassie] What about you? Leaving me here to do the mopping. - It's your turn to do the mopping. - Well just show me where your precious bleach is. - In the mop closet, where else? (suspenseful music) (footsteps approaching) - He's gone. - We're on our way. - Two down one to go. - Technically two to go but yeah. Yeah we're on the right track. Thank you Cassie. So you guys hanging out tonight or? Alright. See you back home. - Yep. Listen, I'm sorry I know you didn't want to be involved in any of this thievery. - Yeah no it's fine. - You kind of had fun didn't you? - I kind of did. But I mean it wasn't like we were stealing-- - No right. - It was like we were reclaiming. - Right. - Do you want to give me a ride? - God, like we're back in high school. Come on. (acoustic piano music) - This is it. - Nice. - I want to do it again. - [Cassie] Break into your apartment? - Yes. - You want to break in to your own apartment? - Yes. - Okay. - [Zelda] It's that easy? - No. I'm just that good. - Okay I want to try. - Tension wrench, rake. - Okay just let me try. - You really need to understand how-- - Let me try. (acoustic piano music) ♫ There is a river wide ♫ There is a river ♫ You caught a glimpse of it ♫ Do you remember ♫ There is a place for us ♫ Beneath the raging waters ♫ If we could taste and see ♫ If we could taste and see - I did it. I totally did it. - Yeah only took you 45 minutes. - [Zelda] Here. - Oh you can keep them. - [Zelda] Seriously? - Yeah, pretty sure those are jinxed. - You think it's real? The time machine. - Are you kidding? Of course not. Why? What would you do if it was? - Oh I don't know, meet famous people? Mary Geary, I bet she'd be fascinating conversation. And Sylvia Plath, to visit here the night she died. - Would you try and stop her? - Well you can't because-- - Yes, self-consistency blah blah blah. - Right. But I could sit with her, talk if she wanted. And at the end she wouldn't be alone. - What about in your own life, what would you change? - You can't. - If you could. - I don't think I'd want to. - Really? You have no regrets? - I don't think of it like that. It's more like, well take you and me. Think of all the misery you've put me through. - I've put you through? - Well you can be a pretty frustrating person to be friends with. - Oh can I? I was not without my own frustrations by the way which one might argue were significantly more substantial than yours. - I mean that I wouldn't change the bad stuff if it meant giving up the good stuff. - Oh there was good stuff in addition to the pretty frustrating? - Yes. - Well let's hear it. - Oh shall I count the ways? - Yeah. - Despite all this you make me smile. - What that's it? - Don't be greedy. What would you change if you could? - Everything. I may have overdone it with the wine. - [Zelda] You think? - Thanks for letting me crash. - Of course. - So Sylvia Plath? - Yeah, I got into her in college. - The slime of all my yesterday's rots in the hollow of my skull. - The future was lost yesterday. as a tennis ball at twilight. - a tennis ball at twilight. - I feel like we're back in fifth grade. - I hope not. I feel like we're on that camping trip. - Cassie, you know I love you right? - Do I? - You should. - Now? - Oh yeah sure come in. The folks upstairs have requested a blood sample. Is that okay? - Do I have a choice? - [Tech] Hold that. - So Cassie spent the night? - Not like that. - Like what? - She just slept over. - Isn't that what I said? She spent the night. What happened next? - Good morning. You must be Cassie. - We got a little drunk and Cassie didn't want to drive home. - Okay. - Nothing happened. - [John] I said okay. - Cassie. Where's your car? Someone stole Cassie's car. This is ridiculous. It was one thing with the bikes but now this? - [Cassie] Hang up the phone. - Your car was stolen. - Z, hang up the phone. - I think it's time we addressed the elephant in the room. - You took her car? - I moved it, just up the street. But I did take this. Or took it back I should say. You didn't open it. Why not? - There was time. - Can you open it? Show me. Safe cracking is a lost art. I used to do it myself many years ago but (bat thumping) not since the tinnitus. - What's inside? (suspenseful music) - How'd you know? - Flannigan. Don't take it personally. He was (bat thuds) under duress. Side note, you're deal with him is going to put on hold. - So you understand my price and why it's not negotiable. 100,000. - 100? - Dave. - But we don't have that kind of money. - Of course you don't but this man does, John Foster. He carries his bank roll in cash. You get me his money I'll give you the file. (suspenseful music) - Why him? - He used to work for me 10, 12 year ago. Sadly his performance was not exemplary. I provided a fair severance package but as the years tick by well some things we let go and some things we just don't. So do we have deal? - No. - Yes. - Well but that's-- - I said yes. We'll do it. - Bit unprofessional don't you think? Picking a peers pocket. - So that's why you came back, not for me but for him, for that. And you. All these years you been lying to me. You're not a travel writer. You're a thief. - Well thieves and travel writers are rogues of a certain strength. I could see Anthony Bourdain as a thief. - Hey, you have a type. - Okay. - And that type is douche bag. - Oh I'd sit back down if I were you. We still have things to discuss. - Nothing involving a baseball bat I hope. - No. This. - You stole it from Flannigan. - Well I didn't drive all the way to Vegas just to bop him on the head. Now, how much is fair? - For the file? - No, to buy in. 10? 20? Let's say 20. I want to meet Belsky's grandson, compare notes. Why don't you bring him by tomorrow morning? Great, and bring the battery and guidance box too as a show of good faith. And cheer up trooper. We're going to make history. Found you. I was 18, living on the street, no food, no money. I started stealing because I had to. And turned out I was pretty good at it. So I kept at it, I got better. I developed an ear, learned how to pick locks, crack safes. But then I had this kind of life changing experience, I got a second chance and I decided to go straight and it was tough. I never went to college. And the kind of job I could get. But I did what I could. I made enough. But then I met you. And I fell I love with you. And you fell in love with me. And suddenly enough wasn't enough. I wanted to give you more and the only way I could do that was to slip back into this other life. - So it's my fault. - Well you did want to go to Paris. Zelda it's a job, just a job. But if you really want me to stop. - I want that. - Then I'll stop. But it was a little sexy right? (acoustic piano music) - [Television] So strollers are the new fat people. Laugh it up that's the whole joke alright. I'm tired of doing all the work. Must I, must I? Can I get a little help? Let's make the connections together right? There in my way, yes. (laughing) (acoustic piano music) - Coffee? Do you want to talk about it? - I really don't. - There was a girl. I'd spent half of my life chasing her and every once in awhile she's let me catch her. But it was never right when we were lovers. Even when it felt like it was. If I had it to do over I'd give up the chase before it started. Just let her go. Want to take the day off? Go ahead take it off. - Morning. Come in, come in. (suspenseful music) Project Cuckoo-- - Was the governments name for my grandfather's machine. I know. Insult to injury. Where is it? (suspenseful music) - I tried for many years to make it work. Of course I couldn't, not without these. The project was moth balled in 1995 and sent to a storage facility. - So how do we get it? If these floor plans are correct I should be able to find it-- (door opens) You're home early. One second. Zelda wait. - You said you were done. - I am. - That didn't look like done. - That looked like you sitting around running some kind of con. - It's not a con. - There is no time machine, it doesn't exist. - Well then I can't steal it can I? - Call it off. - What? - Go back in there and call it off. - Zelda. - Call it off or you and I are done. - I can't. - Okay. Have fun stealing your time machine. - You know the funny thing about time travel? We do it every day. Our memory takes us into the past. Our imagination takes us into the future. You don't need to build a-- - There's my keys. If you try to come near me I'll call the police. - So where are we going? - Need you to crack a safe. - Oh is that all? - It's residential, no security, no alarms. - Who's the mark? - An old friend. The safe's in his bedroom. Grab everything that's inside. - What I can't crack it? - Well that'd be disappointing wouldn't it? (knocking on door) - John, Cassie, welcome. - Hello, John? - Well dinner's nearly ready but first join me for a coffee. - It's not decaf is it? - Do I look like a monster? Of course it's not decaf. - Up top. - Oh lighten up John. This is quite a singular moment. We might as well enjoy ourselves. - So Walter do you know this dude through Zelda or what? - Actually the other way around. John and I go back gosh how many years now? - One or two. - Oh he's just being polite about my age. - And are you really gay? Zelda thinks your gay. I think you're a creeper. - I have been gay but I prefer women. Does that make me a creeper? - Man where did you dig this guy up? Digging the coffee though. Could I use your restroom? (suspenseful music) - Upstairs on the left, across from the bedroom. (suspenseful music) Is this exciting for you? This moment now? - I just want what you promised. - Is that all you can say? Aren't you just a little bit tingly? Standing on the cusp of uncertainty. - It doesn't feel uncertain. - It could be. It could end here if we let it. Our sins could be expunged. - It was consenting adults. - Uninformed consent. (suspenseful music) (film beeping) If you search your thoughts you know I'm right. - I know you're old, and I'm beginning to think you're senile. - I'm plenty sharp. But memory that's a tricky thing isn't it? There was a time when I go back year by year and remember every detail as clearly as when it first happened. And then that went away, sooner than I thought it would. Funny thing remembering that you used to remember more. Tell me John how clear are your memories? - Clear enough. - Well I better set the table. (suspenseful music) - Why do you have this? Is this what you wanted me to steal? - No. It was this. - Tell me Cassie years from now when you're old and gray what will you regret? - This is my entire childhood. - I'll tell you what I regret. There was a woman. I loved her more than life itself, or at least I thought I did. The fact is I sought to possess her, like a thing. Who did I love more? Her? Or myself? - What do you want with me? - To spare you regret. (dramatic music) (dull thumping) (music stops) I had to try. - No you didn't. - Please let me keep them. Please? (somber music) - Who is he? - Walter Markham. - Who is he really? - You're a smart girl. You'll figure it out. (somber music) ♫ There is a place for us ♫ Beneath the raging water ♫ If we could taste and see ♫ If we could taste and see - Cassie. See you tomorrow. - There's something I need to show you. (film beeping) - This is Doctor Hyrum Belsky. This is my assistant Archie. This is the first field test in our laboratory of the time transference device. May we begin Archie? (machine rumbling) You're fine, you're fine Archie. (machine rumbling louder) (electricity crackling) (helmet explodes) (rumbling stops) - So what happened? - He died is what happened. This machine, this whole thing. Dave's grandpa was a loon. All he built was a device that explodes peoples heads. - Maybe. - What do you mean maybe? - I don't know. I never thought any of this was real. But I was at your bosses house tonight. - What? - He had this. Why did he have this? I have to help John steal the time machine because I have to keep him from using it. - If he uses it he's dead. - Unless what if he's not? What if despite all outward appearances he'll be able to go back in time, change things? - Even if he could somehow go back-- - You can't change the past? - Well you can't. - Are you willing to bet your whole life on something you read in a book? Because if you're wrong and he can go back in time what's to stop him from hitting the delete key on both of us ending us before we even began? - He wouldn't do that. - But if he could then he could. Do you get me? (phone buzzes) - [John] Hello. - You're the stealing the time machine tomorrow. - I'm going to try. - I want to come with you. - Why, did you call the police? - [Zelda] No. - Said if I came near you you'd call the police. - This is me coming near you. - Zelda what if we forget about the time machine? Forget everything. What if you and I just go away together? Just get in the car and go. If could be like it was. - No it can't. - Alright. Wear sunglasses. - He agreed? - He agreed. - Good. Then let's get to work. (upbeat music) I'm here and you have to go forward and around. (upbeat music gets louder) (overlapping voices) (acoustic piano music) - If I could go back and change something I wouldn't let all those years go by without seeing you, without you being a part of my life. If I could change the past that's what I'd do. It was just a kiss. I shouldn't have... I'm sorry. - I really did love you you know? - I wish I could give you more. - I wish I didn't need more. - Well you're about 10 hours early. - We need to talk. - Please come in. - There's some fundamental things we need to straighten out. This machine is more and just my family's legacy. It's my responsibility. And as soon as we figure out exactly how it works and what it does there needs to be a serious conversation about how it should be responsibly used. - [John] Responsibly? - That's right. - Well if your friends have their way it'll all be a moot point. Zelda wants to join us on our excursion tomorrow. Which can only mean that Cassie recruited her. - What do you mean? - They want to steal it for themselves, cut us out. - What, but they--- - Dave. Relax, we're gonna keep that from happening. But first things first. Let's fix you some coffee. (dramatic music) - Brought the hammer. Just in case. I can hide it in my coat. I don't need to see anything. (acoustic piano music) - What if we forget about the time machine? Forget everything. - I wouldn't let all those years go by without seeing you. - What if you and I just go away together? - You could come with me you know? - If I could change the past-- - Just get in the car-- - that's what I'd do. - and go. - It's not the destination that intrigues me. - It could be like it was. - I really did love you you know? (acoustic piano music) - I didn't bring, I didn't get nervous. You didn't bring a bar. Did you bring a bar? Like a, no probably not. I should of brought one I have like a box of blueberry bars in my cabinet but I... We could stop at Winchell's. I think there's a Winchell's on the way. You like Winchell's? Are you more of like a, like a local donut? (suspenseful music) I like a local donut. (suspenseful music) - Listen, listen. (groaning in pain) You leave this room and you'll never be with her. - This is your fault. You and Cassie we're gonna cut me out. - No we were gonna destroy it. - That's cutting me out. - So there it is. I'm you. I've always been you. You become me. And then you become him. I should have told you before but I was greedy. Thought I could change things. - John's in there right now he could be using it. - Here you'll need this. You can't change the past. That is still your future. Still don't believe me? Then I'll go first. (suspenseful music) - John's lied to all of us. You think he didn't lie to you? - No John respects me. He understands me, he. (electrical buzzing) - Give me the hammer. - No I... (electrical buzzing) (hammer drops) - [Cassie] Is this what you wanted me to steal? - No. It was this. Here you'll need this. You can't change the past. That is still your future. - If I could go back and change something I wouldn't let all those years go by without seeing you, without you being a part of my life. If I could change the past that's what I'd do. I wish I could give you more. - I wish I didn't need more. Oh God. (alarm blaring) (suspenseful music) I'll see you again. - No don't. - Mr. Belsky. We'll try again tomorrow. - This is a release freeing the government of any indemnity from yesterday's events. - What? - This is a nondisclosure agreement. It includes the contents of your deposition to my collogue as well as additional articles listed herein. Make sure you read it before you sign it. And finally these are the terms of your conditional probation. You need to return here once a year for a physical examination. Any breach of these terms and we will detain you further. Do you understand? - What about the bodies? - What bodies? (dramatic music) We will want to examine the child assuming the delivery is successful. - What? - You didn't know? It was in your blood work. - What was? - You're pregnant Miss Jones. Congratulations. - Oh there he is. Hi Charlie, my name's Walter. Come on in, come on in please please. How old is he now? - Almost two. - Ah, he's beautiful. - Thank you. - I miss you at the bookstore. Would you ever consider coming back? Well it's good to see you. It's been far too long. - [Zelda] Why did you have this? - That's not mine. - Walter. - What's past is past. (acoustic piano music) (car starts) I'll see you again. (suspenseful music) - What's past is past? (suspenseful music) No, that's not good enough. (suspenseful music) - He told me. - [Walter] I have many regrets Dave. Most of them I can do nothing about. - And I didn't believe him. - But I wanted you to see this. You were always a good friend to me and well this is the least I can do for you. - So there it is. I'm you. I've always been you. You become me. And then you become him. - I would love to just work in that bookstore with you. - [John] Three lifetimes, try not to be greedy about it. - He said it wasn't an insult. It's the name he gave the machine, Project Cuckoo. It was descriptive. - The cuckoo is a bird parasite. - It finds the nest of another bird. - Kicks the egg to the ground, and lays one in it's place. - To travel back in time you have to move faster than light. - Impossible for physical matter. - My grandfather knew that. Knew he could never send a body. But a mind. - There was a girl. I'd spent half of my life chasing her. And every once in awhile she'd let me catch her. But it was never right when we were lovers, even when it felt like it was. - But a mind. Of course it would need somewhere to go. - Someone, but the brain... - Is like a computer. In order to upload all that data it needs an empty drive. - So, just like the cuckoo bird the traveler empties the nest and takes it's place. - But what about the infant? The person who came before? - There only ever was the traveler. You can't change the past. - Zelda for what it's worth I had no. - [Walter] The traveler empties the nest and takes it's place. - [Dave] But what about the infant? - [Walter] There only ever was the traveler. - [John] You can't change the past but-- - [Cassie] But the future, the future awaits.
