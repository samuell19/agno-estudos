This story is based on history and legends but has not been adapted literally. The soul of the adventurous lover... A free soul. Only it can cross the gates of time, because it holds the secret... I'm the gatekeeper of Egypt. Run, Hasan! Hasan! SOMEWHERE IN EUROPE, 1975 MASTER'S DEGREE IN EGYPTOLOGY Take good care of him, David. Make sure he studies Egyptology, to honor his father's request. Don't worry. I'll treat him as one of my own. Don't worry. This is against my will. I want you away from your dad's enemies. I'll miss you. I'll check on you from time to time. Run, Hasan. Hasan! FAMILY MANSION - LUXOR, 1975 Who are you? -I-- -Carry the luggage, boy. He's Mr. Hasan, son of the Pasha. Come in. Come in, Mr. Hasan. We're pleased to have you. Welcome. I'm Qadem. Don't you remember me? I've been around since this house was built. -You used to pee all over me-- -Enough! Your uncle is very sick. He's with the doctor upstairs. It looks like he's not going to make it through the night. He's waiting for you. Go on. Very low blood pressure. Uncle? Uncle? It's me, Hasan. May he rest in peace. It's me, Hasan. Don't force it. I know you've lost your voice. I remember you. I remember your kindness after my parents died. And your voice. You spoke as beautifully as you sang. I'm going to sell this house and we'll go abroad. I can cure you there... and hear your voice again. What would you like to drink, Mr. Abdel-Aziz? Nothing, Qadem. Thank you. You have to drink something. How come, Qadem? Whoever enters this house must drink something. We don't take no for an answer. Fine. I'll have coffee. Black. We don't have sugar. Seriously? -My condolences. -Thank you. I'm Abdel-Aziz Nashar Sudfa, your dad's lawyer after the revolution, manager of his office during his heyday, while we were still in service. I'm glad you're here, I need you. I'm here following the instructions of the deceased, Pasha Bishr. What instructions? Pasha Bishr told me, "If I die... and my brother Mostafa dies... look for my son, Hasan. Seek him out wherever he is, and offer him your help." I didn't come here to dwell on the memories of my dad, knowing that he's been an unjust and oppressive man. I'm here to sell the house and go back home with Mrs. Naemat. That's not the wish of Pasha Bishr. My father is dead. But I'm here and I'm selling this house, with or without your consent. Truly your father's son. I understand you, son, and I'll do whatever you want, but these procedures take time. We're in Egypt. The execution of the will could take two to three months. You have to remain here until everything is done. We'll see what happens until then. You might change your mind. I won't change my mind. We'll see. Uncle Qadem? Uncle Qadem? Is something wrong, sir? What's the shooting about? The Assi clan are welcoming you. -By shooting? -It's their way of welcoming. I'll tell you later about the Assi clan. I'm going to bed. And how am I supposed to sleep? If you can't sleep, I have something important to show you. -Important? -Come. -What is it? -Watch. -Is the camera on, Abdel-Aziz? -Yes, sir. Close the door behind you. Yes, sir. How are you, Hasan? You're grown up now, right? If you're watching me right now, that means I'm dead. I'm no longer on Earth. But you're an extension to my existence. I've always believed that a well-educated person can lead a good life. That's why I asked Mostafa to send you abroad. To study the history of your ancestors. You're Hasan. Hasan Bishr. My son. The road is long and treacherous. Should you fail on that road, my memory will be lost. Qadem has the second instruction, which is your first clue towards finding the treasure. It's your treasure, Hasan. The one I've left for you. Show it to him, Qadem. Don't fear for Hasan, not even for the Assi's bullets. "Hatshepsut. Foremost of Noble Ladies." How did you get this papyrus? Your dad asked me to give them to you. What's the relationship between Hatshepsut, Ali Zibak and Dad's recordings? I know nothing. Your dad said, "It's all in the diaries." You have to read them to understand. It was your dad's final wish. You must fulfill it. Read and understand. I don't understand. Don't bother me with these questions. What did you study in Europe? "The beginning, at the temple." Why are you worried, High Priest? Is it related to priesthood matters? There's more to life. Please elaborate. The king is dying. We're all in danger. All of us? How? Thutmose I, son of Amun-Ra, has no heir. Why is there no heir? He has a son, Thutmose II. He's the son of a minor. Hatshepsut is the only child of real bloodline. This is wrong. Hatshepsut is of legal age, and can rule without a regent. It's unacceptable for a female to sit on the throne of Amun-Ra. This is against the will of the clergy and the people. Are you aware of the gravity of this? The only heir is a female... unlike any other. A female warrior. She's stronger than Thutmose, and any other man. She was raised by the Wise Man Eni, who hates us all. He made her hate us too. Hatshepsut, the soul will always face judgement. He took care of her as a child. He raised her on his ideas and beliefs. He's sick. I would kill him myself if it weren't for the pharaoh protecting him. Who sits on the throne? You, the High Priest. The voice of God. We have everything. We have the power, the arms, and the trust of the people. You rule over Egypt. I'm the High Priest. I'm the ultimate voice of God. I'm the wise rule. I'm the throne. Not the one who sits on it. So we let a woman rule Egypt? We hand the throne to Hatshepsut and Eni? No. I decide. I speak on behalf of the God, Amun-Ra. I choose who gets to rule Egypt. My decision is sacramental. The priests have convened, they're always ahead of us. They're securing a place in power. Always eager to control the throne of the pharaoh. He's the ruler and they're the throne. He's the God and they're his power. What do you think, Master? Who's worthy of the Egyptian throne? Me, or Thutmose II? You have the answer. Everything is inside you. You have the answer to each and every question. I'm the daughter of Amun-Ra. I'm the legitimate daughter and ruler. You answered your own question. Do you truly believe you're God's daughter? If I said it, that means it's true. Being a pharaoh is below me. -You're a woman. -I'm not a woman, nor a man. I'm the pharaoh. The priests will stir the people against you. No one comes between the pharaoh and his people. I choose to know my people. BIOGRAPHY The narrator tells the story of Ras Al Ghoul and his son, Ali Zibak. At any time, this country Keeps on delivering Telling stories about a child A very brave child Standing his ground against the flood Always the hero of all times Standing his ground against the flood Always the hero of all times Darkness spread its wings DAMASCUS UNDER THE OTTOMANS It's Judgement Day When justice is lost The law of the jungle prevails The vandals roam our land freely A sleazy and despicable liar Who spits poison An imposter and a wicked sorcerer Made his people's miseries Weigh mountains and valleys Yes, Governor. You asked for me? It's a sad day in Damascus when the police fail to disperse the commoners, and cause so many deaths. The head of the sultanate gendarmerie came in person, this means there's been huge negligence. I refuse to live blissfully in Istanbul and Astana while Damascus is ruined, all because your men are careless. Careless? It seems the life of bliss in Istanbul has made the lieutenant playful. Didn't you ruin Damascus with your orders and schemes? And robbed people of everything? Who deprived Damascus of its wealth? This the first time I've seen a lieutenant blaming others for his errors. Stealing, plundering and robbing the rich. You attribute your failure to plots from our end. Admit you're not fit to rule and too weak to control the commoners. Behave when you talk to Lieutenant Hasan Ras Al Ghoul. He ran to your rescue when you needed him. If it wasn't for exploitation and over-taxation, peace would be reigning. This country is occupied by the Ottomans, and what we say goes. We all know that you're a crook. You were lucky in becoming a lieutenant for the sultanate, but we'll never take orders from you. Governor of Damascus, I'm an emissary of the Sultan, and I'm being humiliated in your presence. You asked for it. I ask you to behave in my presence. Salah El Kalbi is my equal. You need to apologize to him. Hasan Ras Al Ghoul never apologizes to an ill-mannered invader. We won't live where we're not respected. -You'll leave it in ruins. -You created this. It's either us or Al Kalbi. Salah Al Kalbi is irreplaceable. You'll have to excuse us then. Take your men to Egypt. Wait for me in Luxor. I'll join you later. This place is no longer safe, Omar. Let me stay with you. Don't worry. God is with us. Go. Go! Fatma! Fatma! Ali? -Father? -Hasan? Father? Hasan? What happened? I'm seriously injured, Fatma. Who did this to you? Al Kalbi. Take Ali and go to Egypt. Egypt? Yes, Egypt, Ali. The land of your ancestors. You'll be among your people. Never wrong the poor. Your pride always comes first. Don't forget your father. Go on. Watch the road. -Come closer, Fatma. -I'm here. When you arrive in Egypt, go to Luxor and ask for Hajj Amri. Stay in the house that I've told you about. That holds the treasure. The treasure is safe, as long as it's guarded and not taken. Hasan! Hasan! LIFE OF ALI ZIBAK AL MASRI, SON OF HASAN RAS AL GHOUL -Uncle Qadem? -Yes? Come here. Are you hiding anything? I've served this family for years. As Pasha Bishr taught me, I should not hear, see, or talk about anything. Is something wrong? Thank you. It's a story of struggle and exhaustion. Until I became an important police officer, the only thing that made my life miserable was your Uncle Mostafa. He was the only threat to my future. Hello? Bring him in. Yes, sir. Uncuff him and get out. Really? -You let them drag-- -Get up. How dare you? You're being investigated. You'll break our mother's heart. She'll be very sad. -Brother-- -Not one word. Shut it. She'll be sad, but I know how to calm her down. You have every right to say that. I promise on my dad's grave, Brother. I'll never do that again. If he were still alive, he would've died again, seeing his youngest son in this situation. I made you a promise, and I'll keep it till I die. I swear to you, this is the last time. You've promised before and I believed you. I work in an important agency. I won't let anyone, no matter who they are, undermine my status. Even if they're my brother. I promise you that I'll leave here a different person. I was never an addict. I'm an occasional user, and I do it for fun. Fine. I'll believe you. Still, you should help your brother. Even if you don't know who's selling the drugs, you can get me his name from your dirty friends. They know who you are and who your brother is. I'll tell you. His name's Ibrahim Al Iryan, and he lives in old Egypt. Now you're talking. Here's a piece of paper. Write down everything about them. The drop locations, everything. Then sign your statement. Don't worry, Mostafa, you're my brother. Write it down. Yes, Abdel-Aziz. Come and take him away. Yes, sir. Put him in custody. -Sir, please. -Don't worry, Mostafa. Just for a short time. Go. -Now-- -Wait, Abdel-Aziz. Take this. This is the name of the guy. Ibrahim Al Iryan, Old Egypt. Raid his place and collect the drugs. He's got plenty. All the details are in there. Congratulations, then, Major General. Not yet. I'm not a Major General yet. Not yet? We'll arrest Ibrahim Al Iryan's gang. In just two days we'll have raided the biggest drug dealer in Egypt. So you're definitely going to be Major General. Let's release him. He's had enough. He's still your brother. How can we close the case if it was reported by a drug-user? Based on a warrant? What if your enemies in the ministry know that your brother is an addict? Because of my enemies in ministry, I should make an example out of my brother. Then no one will use his release against me. Abdel-Aziz, Mostafa has to be locked away. -Go. -Yes, sir. May God avenge me. May God avenge me. You're sending your brother to prison. Don't worry. He'll be taken care of, at least he'll be clean of drugs. He'll be treated as a witness. It's only one year, Mother. Bishr, he's your little brother. You're like a father to him. How could I hurt my son? I raised him. Too bad. Unfortunately. Oh, Kalbi. You're eluding the Caliph in Istanbul while you have your eyes on the Persian throne. I only follow the protector of God and Shariah. How can you protect religion with a black heart? I'm losing my patience. Speak. Where's the son of Ras Al Ghoul? The secret is out He heard her words And he turned pale She saw a boy in a desert Holding the hand of his mother If he doesn't make it You'll definitely die at his hands You have a dangerous path The boy is ready to fly Either you kill him, or he kills you Listen to my words The boy is determined to take revenge If he grows on this land Your fate will be sealed Either the boy dies Or you die. Or you die Send a message to our lord in Isfahan, that our troops are marching. Soon he'll hear the good news. Yes, sir. -Dad? -Zainab? Why are you up? I'm scared. I keep hearing strange voices and I can't sleep. Scared? Come here. Don't be scared. I miss Mom. May she rest in peace. Come. Don't be scared as long as I’m here. -I want you to be the bravest. -I'm scared. I'll put you in bed. This is the house of Hajj Imari. Hajj Imari? Hajj Imari? Yes? This lady and her son want to see you. Hello. They've killed Ras Al Ghoul, and his family is lost. We were told to come and see you. I'm the widow and he's the son. What a waste! Like father, like son! You're most welcome. -Hijazi? -Yes, Hajj? Take the lady and her son to the old house of Ras Al Ghoul. Bring them food and whatever else they need. Thank you. Welcome to Luxor. Be strong. The house is abandoned and ruined. It was occupied by evil people. Ali Shadid fears only God. As you wish. I'll take you there. I think you should know that when night falls, the house becomes alive with spirits. They start calling out to each other. Cut it out. Come on, open the door. Okay. -What are you looking at? -What are these houses? The houses of our ancestors. -They live there? -They lived there. They left all this behind and more, but we know nothing about them. -Let's get inside. -And the spirits, Mom? What spirits? They don't exist. PALACE OF EGYPT'S GOVERNOR Lieutenant Kalbi. You shouldn't have troubled yourself. This is nothing compared to your generosity and hospitality. Any news of the Caliph? These are two decrees from the Caliph. The first allows me to annex the gendarmerie of Egypt under my rule. The second is about imposing new taxes, the Sultanate needs more money to face its enemies. This might cause upheavals similar to those in Damascus. That's why I'll control the gendarmerie of Egypt. To fight off any rebellion. May God be with us. Anything else? Sheik Heiba Malti, highest Sheik of Egypt, and my first advisor. The defender of our rule and that of the sultan in Astana. I would advise you to consult him, and listen to what he says. Of course, sire. We'll take good care of Sheik Heiba. We'll include you in our prayers next Friday. What's this old house, Uncle Qadem? It's a very old house. No one knows when it was built. When your dad built this house, he annexed that property to his. They call it, "The House of Spirits." I've never been there. Spirits? Nonsense! Pasha Bishr never entered the house, and forbade anybody else from entering it. Do as I say. Do not enter the house. Earthquake! Leave me alone or I'll hurt you. Let go of me. -Calm down, boy. -Let me go. -You're tiring me out. -Let me be. -Here you are. -Who are you? I'll make you pay. You're as brave as Ras Al Ghoul. Omar Al Khataf? What did you bring me here? I'm scared for you. I don't want you to be seen with me. Listen, Ali. The road is not easy. If our master is gone, someone must take his place. Which road and what master? I don't understand. The road of the Braves, Ali. And the righteous. God created us to protect the oppressed. We're his hands, eyes, and also his dagger. -I will do all this? -People need hope. And the Braves are the people's hope. And you're the hope of the Braves. I'll make sure you're the bravest. Look around you. Do you see the walls? -The spirits? -No, Ali. People have engraved their stories into these walls. They're gone but the stories live on. Do you want to die with no history, or do want to be like them? And your story will live on for thousands of years. Make a choice, Ali. I made my decision, Uncle Omar. I want my story to live on. You're a good boy, Ali. -No one's coming, Father. -He'll be here. Ras Al Ghoul is dead. We're not sure about his son. -He's still a baby. -I've raised him as I did you guys. I named him "Zibak" because no one can catch him. Each of you has one quality but Ali has them all. There he is. Ali, the son of Hasan Ras Al Ghoul. -And these-- -Don't say anything. I've met your boys, Uncle Omar. I don't need their names nor their traits. One look at them is enough. Zueet. He turned an arrow into a sword, and a sword into an arrow. Mueet. A sharp eye like a hawk. This one is Bahlwan, he climbs walls. If you're fat, you're still needed. No one takes my food. No need to be angry, my fat friend. Enjoy it, you brave lad. Truly the son of Hasan Ras Al Ghoul. Where are the other braves? They all dispersed after the death of Hasan Ras Al Ghoul. They'll be united again under the flag of justice. And they'll all know that Ali Zibak is their protector. It's a bond till death. All against those who plundered the land. One hand against all oppressors. And we'll defend the oppressed. -Do you pledge that, men? -It's a pledge, Ali. What do you wish from the king? What do I wish from the king? Listen my lady. The king is a mighty God. He can do what he wants. All we're asking is for him to remain strong and healthy. Who are you? By the looks of you you come from a pharaoh family. No, I'm from a commoner but I stole the outfit of a princess. Good on you. They deserve it, the pharaoh and his priests. Open your eyes. Dream and draw. You're not drawing for anyone. You're drawing your dream. When you draw your thought or sculpt it, it will be immortal. When people see the drawing or the sculpture after thousands of years, they'll say this country was once great. Full of genius artists and engineers. Life is all about science and art. Without them, people will die. And they don't deserve the land they're living on. Make way! The guards. Show yourself. The guards left. Who said I was running away from them? Okay. Guards! No, please! I'm running away. Come up here. Don't worry. Tell me. What did you do? What was your crime? Did you charm someone with your eyes, or did you break his heart? You're from a commoner, but you're well-bred and classy. Common can appreciate beauty when they see it. I ran away from the pharaoh's palace. It's the first time I've seen the market and... The common people. Don't be shy. You've just said it. -Do you live close by? -Yes. I'm an engineer and a tutor. I saw you with the kids. I liked your method. Aside from that... I have many ideas and dreams that I'd like to share with them. Dreams? This commoner would be pleased to show you his dream. Come. GET BRITAIN OUT GET OUT OF OUR LAND I became Chief of Secret Police. Things have changed. Second in command, after the minister. The king trusted me more than the minister. The higher the rank, the more fearful you get. You'd do anything in your power to keep that position. What's this? -Really? -What is it? -There is missing information. -How so? The promotion of Major General Bishr Said Imam, Head of Security. Any news that favors certain people is useless. Changes involve many leaders. Where are the chiefs of police and the directors? Where is my name? Abdel-Aziz Al Nashar Sudfa? A very important name. To let you in my office and offer you coffee doesn't mean I don't exist. I run this ministry. -I'm the main driver. -The news was about leaders only. And I'm not a leader? Who appointed you in this newspaper when you couldn't write one sentence? -Abdel-Aziz--? -Shh... Yes, sir? Okay, sir. Give me one second. Thank you. You're a visionary, Saed. You're a visionary. Here it is, sir. You look so tired. Life is tiring, so it's better to put our effort into something useful. You're right, but we can't risk your health. This is bad. There'll be no time off. There'll be no leaves. Except in the case of death. Why do you want me to take a leave? What will I do at home? I have no kids. Will I stay home staring at my wife? That's not what I meant. I didn't mean to go on a leave, but to rest for an hour or so. Non-stop chasing criminals and bombings. We've had it. Not to mention, we all think you need something sweet. A nice bogasha. A bit of mohalabia. Send someone to get them and we'll eat here. Send who, sir? I'm already fat. I'm talking about a different kind of dessert. Maybe listening to Leila Mourad. Or admiring the exquisite bodies of dancers like Katy or Samia, instead of, "When did you kill him?" "How did you join the group?" "Who taught you how to build a bomb?" This is unacceptable, sir. Where and when, Abdel-Aziz? Where and when? Life is like a theater And people are waiting in queues The ticket of joy is for free And laughing is free of charge The poor guy who always laughs Is wealthier than a prince But the sad one He's the doomed one Let's have fun. Get rid of the grumpy face What are you worried about? Just let go and live your life freely Don't give life a chance To kick you in the butt It looks for a misery lover And strikes him hard If sadness dwells in your mind It will knock you down Luck is irreplaceable And to hell with sadness Stay happy and live your life You need a passport to happiness Life is a theater Thank you very much. Excuse me. It's time for the best. For some lovely singing. A very unique and beautiful voice. Egypt's number one singer, Naemat. We're born fearless of time With an innocent heart in pure white We live dreaming of peace Of the love we once fantasized And suddenly you find yourself Captive of your dream You have to lose in order to win We buy and sell hours But we remain broken What's this? This is my dream. You dream of emptiness, desert and water? Void is beauty. It won't be just desert and water. It will be full of great temples that glorify life. Who are you? I'm Senenmut from Nubia. I was a child when my father begged the priest to take me in. But I was more into drawing and engraving walls, than learning chants. Tell me about your dream. Over there I'll build a great temple, that reaches the sky. A bridge between life and death. Passages made of love, found only by lovers. A temple for the pharaoh? No, for immortality. What do you know about the pharaoh? An everlasting legend in people's mind. An illusion that we fear. And a skeptical truth. Who are you? This is the first time I've seen such beauty. -I have to go. -No, go where? Are you a maid's daughter in a princess' clothes? Please, let me go. Life is compromising on our long journey And we're helpless, can't fight it Life is compromising on our long journey And we're helpless, can't fight it We all spin All of us, in our life circle that we call Impossible love We all spin We all spin We all spin We all spin In our life circle that we call Impossible love -Full house. -What good luck! Hayat? Hayat? Excuse me. Deal. What is it? We talked about ending the gambling, didn't we? You're gone all day, what do you want me to do? Do what any wife does. Go to a club, work for charity, like The Red Cross. -Ask them to leave. -Listen, this is who I am and don't forget it. You're a big shot because of my dad. Join us for a round, Pasha Bishr. Join you for what? -Round. -Round! Your butt has become round. Out of here, you scum. -How dare you? -Come on, get out. -Are you okay with that, Hayat? -All of you! Get out! -Are you crazy? -I want you all out! -You're crazy! -Come here again and I'll arrest you. Where were you? I was worried. -I was in a dream. -What dream? A young, common man's dream. He dreams of turning the desert into a temple. A temple connecting earth to the sky, a bridge between life and death. Eternal life. What else? I felt like I already knew him. And that I'd be seeing him again. I feel like someday I'll know him more and that we'll live a story together. Can you explain this to me? Your eyes explain everything. And I see love in them. Love? That quickly? Since when do souls need time to meet each other? They've already met and they recognized one another. But he's a commoner and I'm to be the pharaoh. That's impossible. There is no impossible love. Mother always told me that love is for the commoners. But for a ruler, happiness lies in the throne. Be wary of the throne's charm. Don't rule with a black heart. Shine like a star, and guide them through the night with nothing in return. These are the words of Wise Man Eni. Kings say differently. And I've chosen to be a queen. As my name says, I'm Hatshepsut, Foremost of Noble Ladies. I want you to be vigilant. Any rebellion or riot against new taxes, you should strike hard to repel any defiance. Deploy your spies everywhere. On the streets, in the shops and even in homes. Should any of you fail or disobey, I won't fire you, no. I'll kill you with my own sword. Go to your posts. -Any news about Ali and his mom? -No, sir. Listen carefully, this is the most important case in Egypt right now. Orders came from Isfahan, they're not mine. -Got it? -Yes. Anything else? Go. I don't want to hear complaints. I'm the boss of this neighborhood. Taxes will be collected. These are the orders of Governor Bahri. Tyranny is a sword Threatening the throats of hard workers And every tyrant will have his reckoning Life has been unfair And they've suffered a lot Fearing the governor And defying the will of God Just let the poor live But you won't let them But you won't let them Who are you? What do you want? I'm here to kidnap the governor and take the money he stole from the poor. All by yourself? Who said I was alone? I have the Elephant's Foot. He's slow but strong. I have Uncle Omar Al Khataf, and Zueet and Mueet. And this one is the wall jumper. There are only three of you. -How will you face us? -Guards? Hold on guys, there's been a mistake. -Didn't you say they were only three? -I meant 3,000, Ali. What do we do now, Uncle Omar? We have no choice, Ali. Let's do it. Police and people are playing Cat and Mouse Both running around in a frenzy As if they are settling a debt We need to stop adding fire to the flame -One says yes -The other says no -Every party thinks -They're in the right -If one says yes -The other says no -Every party thinks -They're in the right The pharaoh and the governor It's always the same -The pharaoh and the governor -It's always the same It's always the same It's always The same Lies and illusions, he respects no one You can't blame him He cares only about power Lies and illusions, he respects no one You can't blame him He cares only about power Only the power Only the power -Don't blame him -Don't blame him Don't blame him Don't blame him for he only sees The light of power But water boils in a second and spills Put the fire down and look around you Life plays its trick on each by turn Who gets burned by the sun Will seek the shade one day But water boils in a second and spills Put the fire down and look around you Life plays its trick on each by turn Who gets burned by the sun Will seek the shade one day He'll seek one day... The shade -Hello. -Hi. The restaurant is fully booked, so I thought I'd share your table. Who are you? I'm the director of the show you just watched. -Really? -Yes, all by myself. -Great job. -Thank you. I'm not afraid of the police. They deserve this. -Really? -Of course. Do you have a lighter? -You'll be in flames soon. -All of me? Come on. Move it! What made you go into politics? You should have kept it artistic. I'm going to die of cold. Come here. What are you saying? I have cold and I don't want you to catch it. Come on. Move it! Move it, lady. -A pleasure meeting you. -Come here. A pleasure? This is your worst nightmare. I was joking. Sure. You wanted to cut their throats earlier. Sons of bitches! We're the Assi family. It's a pleasure to meet you. -We are-- -Uncle Qadem told me about you. -You killed my father. -Who killed mine. It was a payback for killing my grandfather, the big Assi. -An eye for an eye, smart guy. -Then it's over. -You want to kill me too? -No, there is no need. We want what's ours. The deserted house along with its land were ours. Your dad used his influence to steal them from us. You have no right to the house or the land. Pasha Bishr built it, I was a witness to that. It's too soon. Once the inheritance procedures are done, I'll sell everything and leave. Fine, we'll buy it. If not with money then with blood. Is that a threat? We're armed as well. We're protected by knights. Enough, Uncle Qadem. Things have changed, there's law now. And I did say I'm selling. You can send me your offer when the inheritance settlement is done. It's a deal. Just don't disappear. Don't sell the house, Mr. Hasan. Ali and his mom stayed at that same house? I don't know. You never know. Then why you don't want me to sell? The Assi family wants it. They inherited from their ancestors. Your dad asked for you to read the diaries, then you'll know. Those diaries! Make way, please. Come on, sir. Make way, please. The country is in chaos, Abdel-Aziz. Chaos. Yesterday, it was an attempt on my life, and today it's Ameen Osman. I want the culprits caught in 48 hours. Or we'll pay the price, both of us. God save you. -Drive, Husein. -Move it. Have you found a solution to our problem, High Priest? While I was alone in my temple, the wall cracked to release a light. I closed my eyes and light filled my soul. I opened them to see the God, Amun-Ra, smiling and satisfied. He said to me, "My kind priest, the closest to my heart." I cried and knelt before him. I felt that he and I were one. He said in his celestial voice, "Let Thutmose II marry Hatshepsut. Let sacred blood mix with the non-sacred. So it will be legitimate." We believe your sacred vision, High Priest. Return to your temple. Engrave your sacred vision into the temple walls. So it will be known by everyone. The nobles and the common people. Thutmose? Once you marry Hatshepsut, you'll follow her rule. She's the Foremost of Noble Ladies. You speak her words and you seek her advice. You rule with her mind. Because I trust her. Vow to this, Thutmose. Now! I swear, Father. Father! You're originally from Monofiah, meet Abu Al Kum. To an Egyptian father and Sudanese mother. Parents were able to enroll their son in the Egyptian army. He was later released, accused of spying for the Germans, when they found a German radio with him. He goes to prison, escapes and awaits the abolition of martial law, he then shows up again and kills Ameen Osman. Who are you? I'll tell you everything, but I have a tiny request. I've been standing all day. Can I please sit down? No. Who are you working for? I'm Mohamad Anwar Al Sadat. An Egyptian officer. They fired me unjustly, and when I got myself an advanced German radio so our army would have advanced technology, I was falsely accused of being a spy. And now... I stand before you facing a new false charge. It seems that injustice becomes me. -And Ameen Osman. -Ameen Osman? He's the minister of finance, a member of the Wafd Party. What would a peasant like me gain from killing Ameen Osman? Because he blocked my huge accounts at the bank? I have nothing to do with Ameen Osman. Why do you want to change the regime? No one can change it. Nothing is unchangeable. Change is a fact of life. That's if you'd like to hear my point of view, which I tell no one. I thought I might tell you. Do you know what your problem is? You think you know it all, and that we're the state police. No, Anwar. We're not the state police, nor its protective walls. We're protecting the country, and sometimes the state is the country. Do you know who that is? That's Mohamad Ali Basha. Mohamad Ali Basha is considered by many as the founder of modern Egypt and the first Egyptian army. Others said that he was using people, and his reign was a dark period for the Egyptians. Different points of view. Only time will tell. You're right. Time will be the judge. Take him. Go. I have a bigger dream. We have to break free from this tiny circle. Let's bring together all the Braves. Ali, what we did will cause chaos. It's highly probable that the head of gendarmes will look for us himself. We won't wait for him. We'll go to them, to Cairo, the center of the universe. If we nail them there, we'll eradicate tyranny in all of Egypt. By doing this, we'll make our long waited dream come true. Yes, Ali, but we're not as strong. We're stronger in mind and ruse. Leave it to me. What do you think? Should we burn you or poke your eyes? Please, have pity. You didn't pity the people, why should we pity you? Shut up. Let's go before the Elephant's Foot eats that guy. Hatshepsut, my darling. I'm not your darling. I know you have a courtesan named Iset. You're in love with her. You're my wife, the queen. You'll give me a crown prince to sit on the throne after me. True. And I'll be at your service, always obedient and polite. Obedient and polite. Obedient and polite to the throne, not to you. It's the pharaoh's will. You have to give in to me, as he requested. You're the pharaoh of the throne, and I'm your pharaoh. What? The High Priest and his men, along with the army, the country's wealth and its security... All these are controlled by Hatshepsut. I make the decisions and you announce them. You're not just the image of the pharaoh, but you are Hatshepsut's spokesman and her right arm. Why all this? Who gave you these powers? I'm the pharaoh. You swore that you'd obey me. He who breaks an oath is doomed. Are you a lying God? If you know how to govern Hatshepsut, you'll govern the land. Yes! Ask for permission before you enter my quarters. This is my path until one day I'll touch my dreams While inside me my heart is aching I am strong enough to take any path Each one believes in a dream There will be a day A day when it will be true Whether my road is long or short There will be a day A day when I won't break in Everyone believes in a dream There will be a day A day when it will be true Whether my road is long or short There will be a day A day when I won't break in The one who suffers from life He must prevail at some point Abdel-Aziz? Yes, Pasha? Send someone to Naemat's room to tell her I request her presence. Without mentioning my name. Just say a Bey wants to see her. Consider it done. Yes? -Our lovely singer? -Yes? The Bey at table 7 would like you to join him. You do know that I join no one. -Yes, but-- -Tell him that. Yes, ma'am. She doesn't join anyone at the table. -Better. -What? Go, Abdel-Aziz. Why? Let me stay with you. See you in the office, tomorrow morning. Go! Yes, sir. Follow these two, Husein. -Hello. -Good day to you. We found these pamphlets in your house to instigate a change of regime. -Sir, this-- -Shh... These are the confessions of some of your associates, confirming that you took part in some recent crimes. -I didn't do a thing. -Shut up. I can add more charges. I've never seen these things. Lock him up. Yes, sir. I didn't do these things, Naemat. The guy you ordered to be arrested has a relationship with that girl. I don't know if you remember her. The lady singer, Naemat Rizk. -Remember her? -Did you arrest her? Yes, she's in detention. -Since when? -Four hours ago. Send her in in 10 minutes. Yes, sir. Come in. Yes, Abdel-Aziz? She's accused of joining a secret group to overthrow the regime. She's also accused of sabotaging public and private properties. Wasn't she arrested along with the other guy? True, sir. I'm innocent, sir. I did nothing. Intel says that this guy comes to the cabaret every night, and you leave together and go to the same building. He's my neighbor. He lives in the flats across from the motel I'm staying in. You have to tell me everything about your relationship with that guy. Yes, sir. He proposed to me. I refused because I don't love him. Abdel-Aziz? Yes, sir? Yes, sir? Excuse me, sir. I have to interrogate the other suspects. -Excuse me, sir. -Go on. -Listen... -Naemat, sir. Naemat. Have a seat, Naemat. Listen to me, Naemat. The youth of today are reckless. They believe that revolting is for the best, while they're destroying the country. If someone had promised you something, tried to sell you on some silly slogan, tell me and I'll help you. No, sir. I had no idea about his political views. He was just a friend. There is no one in your life? I mean, no one from his circle tried to lure you into their stupid politics. No, sir. Singing is my life. That's what I do. I have no relationships with anyone. Look at me. I'll let you go. You'll go straight home, on my say so. Thank you, Pasha. I don't know what to say. Abdel-Aziz? Come. Naemat, stay away from trouble and from everyone. Any other official wouldn't have fallen for those tears. Especially with what the country is going through, you would have stayed in detention for a long time. But I believe you. Yes, sir? Let the singer go home. Go. We’re at the service of the arts. Come on, star. My queen's request to see me is an honor. I have asked for you to fulfill your dream, Senenmut. -My dream? -Yes. I haven't forgotten. This is where we met for the first time. I'm appointing you the architect of the royal palace. You'll supervise the building of temples and palaces. By doing this you'll fulfill your dream. What my queen is saying is bigger than my dream. Not only that. I want you to tutor my baby when he sees the light. You'll teach him your studies and art. Okay, my queen. Break the news to your wife. Aren't you married? No. Then your sweetheart. You do have a sweetheart. I do. Is she a commoner from Nubia? There are no words to describe her. She's like a shining river under the moonlight. Like the shining sun over the obelisk. Her lashes are more dangerous than a lake of crocodiles. She moves the Nile river, and her anger is a flood. She's hard to reach because she's so sacred. A commoner like me can't even see her. Watch it, Senenmut. You're praising a beautiful woman in front of another. I'm describing my sweetheart to my queen. For me, they're the same. That's poetry. A God's heart is in the sky, it can't be reached by a poet. You'll build temples and castles. A dream you can achieve. As for the other dreams, just keep them as such. All is fine, Pasha Bishr. Get in. Don't be scared. Get in, star. Naemat, you're a talented singer. Thank you. You have a special voice. I don't want you to waste your talent in cabarets. -A true singer has to build their path. -This the only path I've found. I needed connections to grow, and I know no one in Egypt. -Maybe because I'm from Damascus. -I know. I know you are from Damascus, and your family came to Egypt. Your father died, and you had to work to support the family. Your mother died a year ago. Did I do something wrong? Believe me, my friend and I, we did nothing wrong. Look, Naemat. You're a smart girl. If you want to be a singer, you can choose a different path, away from the cabaret. Think of who you want to be and let me know. Like Um Kuthum, Nour El Huda, Leila Murad. There's a new rising young star, goes by Shadia. I'm nothing like them. With me, there is no "them". In return for what? Think of me as an art lover, who wants to protect a young talent from being wasted. What do you say? -Get in. -Thank you. -Hello, guys. -Hi. Please, as you were! Oh, God! Join us, Sheik. -I'm fasting, and it will be dusk soon. -I wish you a blessed fasting. But how can these lentils be delicious? It's God's grace. What's your charge, Sheik? I was on the street on my way home. The police came and arrested some people. They told me to go with them, so I obliged. And here I am. You're one of the defenders of justice. God knows. Maybe I deserve worse than this. Let them antagonize the street in all its fractions. Maybe people will unite against the oppression. Religion is the state and Islam is the solution. What's wrong, Mostafa? Did the Brotherhood brainwash you? That's what happens in prisons. You enter an addict and leave a terrorist. The worst evil is discrimination, it makes the rich get richer. We're all Egyptians, Muslims, and above all else, we're human beings. Do you think it's easy to be a man? A man, Sheik? I'm talking about the oppression. You're right, Mostafa. The country is living in a critical situation. -I'm worried about our country. -Don't worry. Egypt is guarded. Take care of yourself and the country. Dear God! Will you travel to Cairo? I know you very well. You're going to seek him out. Aren't you afraid for me? Why would I be afraid? I raised a real man. I should be strong enough to face him in Egypt to avoid suspicion. -How will you get the money? -I'll dig... and I'll find the treasure that I saw when I was a child. I told you it is highly guarded. You'll hurt yourself. I'll get it. I saw it as a child and I'll get it. Your dad said, "Protect it, you live; take it, you die." Those are just bedtime stories to get kids to sleep. Life is for the living. Right. Go to bed. Tomorrow is a long day. You won't dig the earth, Ali. Who are you? Hello Ali Zibak, son of Hasan Ras Al Ghoul and Fatma Fayoumiah. This land is guarded by a wall. There is a gate at the city wall and a gate keeper. Exactly as it has a governor and a treasury. I'm the gate keeper of Egypt. My name is Allalah. What do you want from me? What can I do? Every age has its oppressor and its brave. Its Sheik and its demon. You're the brave man defending all the oppressed. You fight injustice with ruse, and protect the land and its people. But don't you ever touch the treasures of the land. The treasure belongs to its finder, and I found it. You have a different role. Don't try and take everything. He who wants it all, loses it all. Protect the treasure and you live. Take it and you're done. Do you promise, Ali? I promise, Sheik Allalah. Where's the danger in a flood? It represents bounties of the earth. It is nature's bounty, but can be harmful if not stopped. It washes away houses and crocodiles will fill the land. Is there a way to control the course of the flood? We divert the water to bigger lands for higher crops. This is very costly and almost impossible. Almost impossible. The sacred minister of religion talks about the impossible. You're the minister of a land that feeds the world with its wheat. From the Western Sahara to Mesopotamia in the east. A land with temples that people seek for prayers and knowledge. And you say it's impossible? I think my lord, that the land the Nile runs through can yield solutions. So we can control the flood when it pools in their land. Send them gifts and aid or fight them. Anything to benefit from the waters of the sacred Nile. You speak wisely, my queen Hatshepsut. You're right. Let the man who manages the Nile know its sanctity. I relieve you from your duties. At your service, your highness. What about the army, Minister? Always on alert, Your Highness. I'll personally command the battle. The rebels of Kush must learn a lesson. Glory to you! You're lucky, Ali. It's the glorious night of Imam Husein. Cairo is beautiful, Mother. -Hello. -How's my star doing? -I'm so happy. -More surprises await you. I contracted a new song for you, and a new movie as well. Really? There's one more surprise. Come. Naemat. Where are we, Pasha Bishr? Come. This is your flat. I hope you grant me regular visits to check on you. What will people say? I'm doing this because of people. I can't visit you at the cabaret every time I want to see you. You know my status. I'm sure you know how I feel about you. Your voice enchanted me. It makes me want to get closer. To hold your hands. -To take you in my arms. -Pasha Bishr! Please, Pasha. Leave me, please. I beg you, Pasha Bishr. Don't ruin the image I've created of you. The caring man who takes care of me. I don't want the other image. What's keeping me going is my dignity. Please, don't take it away. I promise you that won't happen again. Please, forgive me. The keys to the flat. I've learned that no one can have it all. If you want to play the greedy game and take everything, all hell will break loose and you'll lose everything. Only the stupid do that. Got that, Hasan? He who wants it all is stupid. The Sheik told Ali Zibak, "He who wants it all, loses it all." Eni said to Hatshepsut, "Either the heart or the throne." Mr. Hasan? Are you talking to yourself? I have a feeling that in all these years I've learned nothing. And now you've learned something? You know, Uncle Qadem? I feel like I'm rootless. I'm so confused. I never saw my father, and my uncle sent me abroad. I don't know if I'm Egyptian. I wanted to sell this place and leave. Now I feel more rooted here by the day. Find your soul and follow it. You're confusing me more with that. I can forget everything, or I can dig deep to get to the bottom of it all. Your nobility obliges, son of Bishri. Your nobility obliges! I made a mistake discussing my feelings with that guy. Unbreakable glass, strong as metal. Come and look at the beautiful silk. Come and savor my rich spices. Taste the most delicious coriander. Come and taste the best sweets ever. I've finished. -How can I help you? -What's that? -Fingers of Zainab. -Whose fingers? Zainab. -Strange! -Wait. You must be Zainab. How did you know? From your fingers. Wait. Uncle Masoud? Wrap half a kilo of fingers for this beauty. The fingers of Zainab are there, Ali. Did you notice him say Ali? That's my name. I'll wrap them for you. Please, don't refuse this. -This silk-- -Is not genuine. Your silky fingers will know the real thing. -You sell sweets, not silk. -I sell silk too. -Such a drag. -Wait. Uncle Rihan. Cut a piece of real Indian silk for this lady. -You cut it, Ali. -That's me too, remember? -You run the whole market? -Of course. Anything you desire is mine to sell. Come on, young man. -Will you leave? -The market is my home. You're my guest. Out of my way, then. -Not before I know what you'll buy. -Watch your mouth or you'll die. Death means nothing before such a beauty. Is someone bothering you? -Yes. -Who? I can't find anything I like in this market. -You're dreaming? -You startled me. Why Zainab, Ali? The daughter of Salah Al Kalbi. The thief. The daughter of the man who killed your father. God blesses your daughter Neferura. What did Iset have? She had a boy, my queen. They named him Thutmose III. The palace is singing with joy. She'll breastfeed him one hour a day, and then you'll bring him to me. I will raise him. Is that clear, High Priest? You're doing the right thing. Hatshepsut? What is it? How can you take a baby from his mother? You're worried about your illegal wife instead of your country? What does the country have to do with this? I'm talking about a hideous stepmother, who steals an infant from his mother. That's how you see it. I see it differently. This is for the interest of the land. I, the daughter of a God, am taking this infant to raise him, to make him a king, a brave knight. When his time comes, he'll be a great pharaoh. Not a reckless child, raised by a commoner. Understood? Yes, Mr. Abdel-Aziz? You have to give me power of attorney over the land registry. I have to finalize some procedures. I want to know more about my father. You were close to him, you can help me. That's not what you said when we first met. You said you wanted to sell everything, and that you wouldn't dwell on memories. Stop the interrogation act. I feel like I'm in an enigma that I need to decipher. I know that you hold my dad's secret. -Those weren't my orders. -What orders? -My dad died 20 years ago. -Even so. If he wanted me to reveal things to you, he would have told me to do so. And I would have complied. The fact that he told me nothing is, in itself, an order. Orders are sacred in our line of work. This is useless. I'm going to change. If you want to say something, just say it. I'll say it. You need to find a solution for your brother and Miss Naemat. If my brother was a coke addict, I'd bring him the drugs, not lock him up. And Miss Naemat... Either you marry her in secret and make her stop singing, or you stop seeing her and let her move on with her career. You're a man of great achievements. You can't let something trivial ruin your whole history. Sit Abdel-Aziz. -This is-- -Sit down. What is success? -Obedience, sir. -Obedience. Obedience is successful in making Abdel-Aziz. Life tricks us every day. With a reckless brother. With a lesser sweetheart. You and your choices. Would you fall for the trap, or follow your instincts and move on? I should follow my instincts. Still wrong. Life... Life needs a balance. Always weigh things to choose what's right. If you follow your mind, you'll dry up, and die. If you follow your heart, you'll be a bum. Always weigh things. If you choose wrong, make sure you know that. And swallow your pride, so you can amend your wrongdoings. Understood? No, it's not. But, all is fine. After my long service with you, I know that God created men like you and men like me. And created other people in between. Thank God we're not them. If you'll excuse me. Deal, Abdel-Aziz? Deal. Daughter of a thief. A sleazy fox with beautiful eyes. Silky hair on a demon's head. Lips like tropical fruits, closing on a snake's tongue. I know your voice and I can see your eyes. Why don't you show me your face? I'm Ali Zibak, here's my face. What would Ali do to the daughter of the man who killed his father? What do you mean? -Your dad killed my father. -What has this got to do with me? It's your inheritance, daughter of Kalbi. If I don't take vengeance on him, I'll take it on you. Vengeance is just. Your eyes are clear, they're not vengeful. Rather consumed by grief. Is this flirting or malice? If it was malice, I wouldn't flirt. A sane girl doesn't answer by flirting. You have sad eyes. I don't know what's keeping me from hurting you. You're in love with the daughter of your nemesis. Would you like me to send you back to your father in a bag? Or do I send him a hair? Do what you like. I'm not afraid of you. In any case, I'll go back with no heart. How are you expressing your feelings? Did Kalbi not teach you decency? What's bad is to keep it inside. Come on. Kill Zainab and I'll forgive you. Send her corpse to her dad. My heart is destined to suffer twice. The first time when your father killed mine. The second, from loving you. Don't be afraid. I'll take the scarf. I'm ready to follow my heart, Zainab. When I get revenge for my father and for the poor... from Al Kalbi, then there will be forgiveness. He's my father, Ali. Hasan Ras Al Ghoul was my father, Zainab. Zainab, are you okay? The guards told me what happened. Rest assured. He was a gentleman and didn't touch me. Wait. Leave us alone. A gentleman? -Do you know the guy? -No. He covered his face. You can ask the guards. -What did you talk about? -Nothing. He took my necklace and left. Zainab, you're my only daughter. I don't want secrets between us. I don't want my enemies to use you to get back at me. Do you know you'll be queen one day? The ruler of Egypt. I don't want to rule a devastated land. I want a country built on love. Love is a toy in the hands of courtesans. If you want to be feared, you have to control your heart. Rest assured, Father. I reigned my heart a long time ago. I know where to send it and with who. I'll find this man. I won't rest till I find him. Go to your room. -Why are you still up? -My heart keeps me awake. How did you marry my dad, Fatma? I met him and told him straight away that I was in love with him. Strange! You told him? I was mounting his horse, and I saw what a kind heart he had. I had no choice. Did you hear what we were saying? What who was saying? The one I took the scarf from. She took a part of me with her. Her smile shines like the moon that lights the dark desert. But I'm afraid. I'm scared to lose her when fate stands between us. You're reciting poetry, Ali! Your son is in love. His first and last love. Oh, Fatma! -Come on, tell me everything. -Tell you what, Mother? It's obvious that Thutmose III will be a great warrior. Of course! I raised him. He reminds me of me as a child. You're laughing! You don't believe me? I believe you. I can take you on in a duel! You took me on in a duel a long time ago and you've won. Come on Neferura, it's time for your lessons with your mentor. Yes, Mother. Hear me out! I am a palm reader and I can discover all your secrets. I can release you from misfortune and provide you with fortunate luck. Let me read your palm, young lady. -I knew you'd come to the market. -I know the market is your home. God! -Who knows the unseen? -Only God knows it. -Your loving eyes are exposing us. -And you are impolite. Love is not polite. If lovers were polite, they wouldn't do what they do at night. Ali, tell me the truth. The truth is in my eyes only. It's yours if you want them. You're an old fool and a fortune teller who knows nothing. Give me a kiss and I'll make miracles. I'll fly with my love on a horse. Ali, do you want to shame me? Your eyes say it all, the people are watching. If we don't move right now, they'll kick our asses. Go to the lake. I'll change and meet you there. I can release you from misfortune and provide you with fortunate luck. I never really belonged in any country. I followed my father from land to land, until I found you. I feel like you are my country. Forget about the Braves, and I'll go with you anywhere. Home is wherever you go. My home is here, Zainab. The land of my father's vengeance. The brave is he who lives with his love in his country. There is no love in exile. Love is pride and freedom. He who loves doesn't flee. I hope I'm as strong. Tomorrow will be better. Don't forget that love is God's creation. God takes care of it. But his believers are ruthless. They won't give love a chance. We'll face them the whole way. Stories of ruthless lovers die with them. Stories of real lovers live on. If only, Ali. Don't be afraid. Tell me, Naemat. If I told you to leave everything, would you do it? I would leave everything. Do you love me, Naemat? You made me. If not for you, I would still be living in that motel. That's not the answer to my question. I'm not ungrateful. Will you marry me? I will. But I'll sing my last concert. Agreed. Ali, come here. Wait for me, mule rider. What is it, brass seller? Come inside. Wait for me! -What is it, Uncle Hamdoun. -Sit down, Ali. Life is not safe here, Ali. The police are asking for more taxes by the day. You won't find income in a land controlled by fear. You're right. But don't worry, your goods are good to sell. Things will change. I can't wait for things to change. I'll go to Mecca and from there to Fes, my hometown in Morocco. You want to leave us? May God accept your pilgrimage. Have a safe trip. I came here as a child and I stayed in this country 20 years. I can't help it. Listen. It took me a lifetime to build this shop. I don't want to give it to anyone. You're an honest man and I like you, but you're broke. If you can gather 50 dinars, I'll sell you the shop. How am I supposed to gather 50 dinars? Think about it and let me know. Keep this between us. What do you think? God is great, Uncle Hamdoun. Wonderful Hamdoun. -What about 20? -50, Ali. I'm coming, mule rider. What's this, Mother? Take it to the pawn shop. Don't sell it. Let someone else pawn it for you. We don't want to raise suspicions. This is a unique piece. Where were you keeping it? This was a very precious gift from your dad. He gave it to me and told me that it's as old as this country. When the time is right, Ali will guard it. Did he tell from where he got it? He said that it was from Luxor. He's keeping it since before we got married. Was it in the ditch in which I fell when I was young? Only God knows. Pawn it my dear, and you'll be a great merchant. I don't want to be a merchant. The market is like a prison, and I feel like a bird that wants to leave its cage. Your son was not born a merchant. Trade will give you prestige. Little by little, you'll fulfill all your wishes. Glory to the son of God, slayer of enemies. -You look tired. -The war took its toll on him. We have the cure. It was a huge battle. Senenmut, engrave it into the temple's walls. Yes, Your Highness. We've captured the rebel leader's son. What do you advise we do now? We kill him to spread fear. Fear will breed revenge, High Priest. There is no governor who will accept the death of his son. And no one wants to be known as the pharaoh who murdered a captive boy. The queen is right. Is fear correct now? Why not give him gifts and send him back as king to his father. No, but we'll raise him well, and teach him our culture. He'll be grateful to us all his life. We'll teach him our art and history. He'll live our life. He'll learn in our temples. When he's grown up, we'll send him back an educated man. He'll rule with our ideas. He'll remain loyal to us. -Where were you? -At the market. Without telling me, and unguarded. You were busy, and I hate the guards. You want me to believe this? -Excuse me, Father. -Wait, Zainab. I know what's going on. I raised you and I know how you think. You're not the Zainab I know. That's something that worries me. What can I do to make you relax? Go to Isfahan, your hometown. You'll find a good suitor there. I'll calm down when you marry. No. I've lived my life here and I'm not leaving. There is only one way to get rid of me. You know what it is. You did it to Mother, remember? You want to leave me and take my daughter from me? I can't take the demon inside you anymore. I'll kill you. Don't worry. Everything will be fine. -Ali? -You go. I escaped Father and the guards to come see you. What's wrong? We have to elope, Ali. Elope? Where? Anywhere. I can't, Zainab. Then you don't love me. I'd give up everything for you. Liar! Zainab! Zainab! Zainab! You mean the world to me, but I have to avenge my father. We don't have time for all this. -Take me with you. -I don't own my destiny. A mother is waiting to avenge her husband. The Braves want to settle an old feud. The people want to take back what they own. You want to be a hero praised by the people. You don't want me. I want you. I swear to God. -The time is not right. -It will never be right. -I won't wait till my dad kills you. -It won't happen. You know why? Because justice always prevails. -Your father is an oppressor. -I won't let you kill my father. To escape is the only way. Ali Zibak doesn't run away. Do what you like. The guy that Zainab is meeting is named Ali and works in the market. He's the guy. Did you bring him? I brought you something better. Send him in. I didn't do anything. I didn't do anything. Hamdoun was selling this necklace in the market. It's an old necklace. Goes back thousands of years. -Where did you find it? -Ali gave it to me. He asked me to pawn it for him. I'm innocent. -Take him. -Come. What the fortune teller said is true. This necklace belongs to the Treasure of Ibli. -How are you, Chaaban? -How are you, Ali? -Hello, Uncle Abdo. -Hi, Ali. What luck! You're here to arrest me. Uncle Abdo, keep this with you. Hello, guys! Surrender, Ali. Or we kill all these people. THE END Did you like the movie? It was beautiful, Your Highness. But surely you didn't send for me and General Hamdi to ask us about the film. Always smart, Pasha. They say you have a beautiful handwriting! That's kind of His Highness. I love nice handwriting. How do you pronounce 'handwriting'? You said it correctly. True. The other one is spoken in Upper Egypt. Imagine, Bishr. Thirteen officers and a sheriff can't arrest a guy named Khot in Upper Egypt. Just like the old days. A smart criminal becomes the head of police. -Your Highness-- -I thought of bringing him here. I wanted him to join the Royal Guard, being that he's so strong. Give us two days and we'll capture him. You have enough on your plate. Major General, I want you in Upper Egypt by morning. I want the Khot dead or alive. Yes, Your Highness. Major General? I don't want your personal life and your relationship with the singer to interfere with your work. Do you understand. Understood, Your Highness. You thought you'd get off that easy? A fool like your father. The fool is he who thinks he's above the rest. If you do kill me, you'll face another one with every sunrise till you're dead, Kalbi. Hold it, Mahran. Listen, Ali. I'll let you go if you tell me where the treasure is. Show it to me and we'll share it. Not only that, I'll let you marry my daughter. Zainab, the one you love. You'll be my right hand man. By doing this we'll be safe from each other's evil quest. The treasure doesn't belong to us. I'll defend it with my life. Then you die today, and I'll find that treasure. Mostafa, the sheriff wants you. -What for? -I don't know. Get up! -What's wrong? -You're the rat? -The informant among us? -I did nothing. Today, you'll both die. -What's going on? -Come on, let's go. -I'm losing my patience. -Hatshepsut is the real pharaoh. She's controlling him. She's made allies within the commoners, the army and the treasury. And Senenmut is building her temples. He gets a new title every day. We are the guardians of the doctrine. -We're sacred, makers of gods. -That was before Hatshepsut. A priest shouldn't talk like that. There is no pharaoh without us. We send the God's soul to his body. We're the mystery that compels people to fear looking at him. We made him strong and capable. We're the secret of his greatness. How can a God creator... -fear a woman. -She's no woman. She's the pharaoh, with Senenmut at her side and the Wise Man Eni. Hatshepsut, Eni and Senenmut. We'll kill all three of them in one night. I've arranged everything, Pasha. After Naemat's concert, the marriage officiant will be waiting in Zamalek. Congratulations, sir. The king ordered me to go to Upper Egypt to capture the Khot. He implied that I must end my relationship with Naemat. So do we carry on with the marriage, or do we cancel it? Yes, sir. Get well soon, my king. Hatshepsut? Do you really want me to live? I wish you a long life, Pharaoh of the Land. You had so many opportunities to kill me, and rule the land. And to kill my son, the only heir, so you would remain the only pharaoh. Hatshepsut is already ruling the land. Feuds will bring on more feuds. Thutmose is like a son to me. I've raised him to be the great pharaoh that this land deserves. Run, Hatshepsut. Why do I need to run? They're going to kill you. I know about the conspiracy. The High Priest wants to appoint himself as regent of Thutmose III and rule the land. The High Priest wouldn't do this without your approval. Your ordered my death, Thutmose? I was so jealous. They filled your head with ideas. Your dominance and your relationship with Senenmut. I couldn't take it. I ordered the palace guards to leave their posts. The palace is ready for them. Run, Hatshepsut! The land needs a strong and wise pharaoh like you. Not priests looking out for their own interests. Run! Oh, God of Gods! You've created me in the best image. I beg you to make my image true. And to send everything back to the sea. Oh, God of Gods! Lift the veil, so lovers can meet. O Dear God, protector of the weak Unveil the ordeal and forgive the evil What do you want? Take this and put it under the table of Bishr. Step out, Pasha Bishr. For whoever harbors evil in his heart, I call for your mighty power. Get in. Stop! I beg you, God, to make him see good. And to forgive him because he sent me to you. Oh, dear God! -What took you so long? -We thought you'd act. Wasn't it better for us to escape? Answer me! I told you I won't leave this country. How was I supposed to live without you if they had killed you? If you don't shut it, they'll kill me right now. I won't. Come here. Where are you going? -Get back. -Get back. At that moment when you think you're free of all evil, and you've achieved what you were looking for, it's that moment where fate is behind you, laughing... and telling you, "It's still early. What's coming is worse." As if trust is the trap. And you think of every peaceful moment as the end, while it's the beginning of a new fate. Tougher and more dangerous.
