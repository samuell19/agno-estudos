- Hi, uptown. - Hi. - Nah. - Here, he's up here, hon. He's up here. Oh. - Oh. - I'll Frankenstein him. You get the pulse. - Okay, sir, we're gonna put some oxygen on you now, all right? Okay, there we go. Breathe in. That's it. - Take it easy, now. - Deeper, sir. That's it, that's it. There we are. - Pressure's dropping. - He's in defib. Here we go. Slime me. - Little dab'll do ya. - Clear. - Hit him again. - Doing okay. Clear. - He's sparking. - There we go. - All right, sir. That's it, that's it. Okay. There we are. - First one's free. - Okay, that's enough. - There we go, there we go. - You'll be all right. You like that, huh? - Was it good for you? - Back up, back up. - What did you put in the oxygen? - I don't know. Give me that. - Best wishes from the blazing skulls. - All south central units, proceed to primary and Lane. The blazing skulls have just shot up five 7-Eleven stores, and the fire they set last night at south central has leveled the station. - Watch it, watch that fire. - Do it now. - Give me some action. - Let's go, come on, let's go. - Steady, steady, keep it steady now. - It's a warzone down there. - Stop the world out there. This is an emergency? Anyone near brewer and shipley, we've got a tennis injury. - Let's do it. - Are you sure? I feel pretty good. - Never fails. First ten minutes. - It was fine then. - You know, we had a similar case last week. A man didn't heed the warning. Within an hour, the arterial poisoning had circulated throughout the entire body. - The pain. Pain. - Tragic. - You should go too, sir. - What? - He's gonna need someone there at a time like this. - Sprained ankle. Book him, danno. That wasn't your husband, was it? - Uh-uh. - Good, good. I like him. You know, we're dealing with multiple contusions with complications with tibial tendon. It's a direct result of his not understanding the physiology of the game. You know the body. - How's the serve going? - It's okay. - Let me show you some of the pointers here. Feet, shoulder-width apart, okay? - And a one, and a two and three, okay. - Keep your eye right where that's gonna go. That's it, good form, good hips. - Let me demonstrate. Okay, pick up the ball. Here we go, and a little closer. - Extension, extension. Hips turned. Oy, that's nice. - Got the ball? - That's great. - I'm with you, I'm with you, I'm with you, and swing. - And bingo. That's-- - keep them bouncing. - Yeah. - Very talented. - Whoo-whoo. - I love sports medicine. - Myself. - Dr. uptown, mad Mike, we got a little Fender bender at the richelieu fountain. Can you take it? - Was it good for you? - Uh-huh. - This way, this way, this way, go. - Hey, we're going left. - Stay here. - Hey, give my man a five for the wash. - Here's five. - Hey. - Feeling better? - I'm fine, I'm fine. Just let me out of here. - Grab your gonads. - I really appreciate the way you're taking care of me. You're doing a super job. You're fantastic. - Go around, idiot! - You guys are fabulous. - All right. - Er/or edq. Dr. bebe to er/or edq. - Ew. - Ew, icky. - How do you intend to pay? Sir, please, you're bleeding all over my desk. After you've completed your medical history and your personal autobiography, fill out the form which details any diseases, disgusting habits, or any nasty rumors concerning any member of your family, in alphabetical order. - But I'm bleeding. - Be ready when I call your number. Next. - Dr. leakey, paging Dr. leakey. Please pick up your urine sample from the lab. - Oh. - Oh, god. Farley, farley, what is it? - Oh. - What, what? Is it your head? - No, it's my heart. - Farley. - don't worry, I'm fine. It's just a touch of narcolepsy. - Oh, I see. The disease du jour is sleeping sickness. - Oh, go ahead. Ridicule, make fun, but it's a terrible thing to live with. You never know when it's gonna strike-- - oh, farley, farley, get up. Farley, you're drooling on my reeboks. Oh, gross. You're a sick man, very sick, farley. - That's what I've been trying to tell you, and what I need in the way of emergency attention is a tender, loving nurse with an outrageous bedside manner. - Oh, now I see what you need. You need a tender, loving nurse... - Yes. - With an outrageous bedside manner. - You got it. - I say sleep it off, farley. - And to think I stood up for you when all the fellas were speculating on why they called you head nurse. - Dr. black, see Mr. brown, green room, code blue. - Oh! - She adores me. - Uh-huh. - Dr. black to the green room, code blue. - Next. - Titillation therapist to-- - do you have shortness of breath? - Yes. - Do you have any dizziness? - Yes. - Do you have any cash? - No. - Next. - Do you take this one? - I don't work. - Y'all better get me a doctor, or you're gonna need one. - How's your liver? - Pretty good. - Neat. - Huh? - Listen, was she blonde? - Blind? - Blonde, blonde. - Come on. - I don't feel so good. - I don't feel... - You will. - Code brown. Robert blasdell to preventive proctology. Code brown. - So big deal. And the reason that you are so interested in her is because she isn't falling all over you. - I don't want her to fall all over me, and that's not why I'm interested in the first place. It's no big deal, but close. Sweet and sour? - Hit it. - We finished cleaning out the inside of your rig. Now do we get dinner? - Well, that was the deal. - Mouse, mouse, see if you can get this refilled for me, huh, buddy? - Farley, Maxwell. - Uh-oh. - I just had my ears chewed off for the last three hours by a congressman. He said two paramedics sent him and a federal judge to mid-city hospital for a goddamn sprained ankle while the so-called paramedics gave tennis lessons and god knows what other kind of lessons to their wives. And what about it? - Well, I think it's just probably another one of your syphilitic hallucinations, sir. Your ear looks fine. - You know what I'm talking about. Unauthorized use of a city vehicle for chasing nooky. - Say what? Nooky? - Is that one of your technical terms, captain? - I'll give you a technical term, smart-ass. Requisition slips. $2,500 for an ambulance stereo system. - Alleviation of pain begins with ambient sounds, sir. Mood music, if you will. It's saved countless lives. - Mm-hmm. $950 for the installation of a sunroof? - Hey, you kidding me? A day without the sun is like a day with-- - the savings in vitamin c alone could help reduce our present pharmaceutical budget for the next couple of years. - How did you plan to explain away purchases of dom perignon and beluga caviar? - How did we plan to explain that? - Simple. Holistic healing. - Now, listen to me, I'm not gonna blow my career and my pension over you two jerk-offs. I'm going to get rid of you before you get rid of me. - Do I sense a smidgen of repressed hostility, captain? - It ain't repressed. I hate you sons of bitches. You treat your jobs like summer camp. You have no respect for authority. You don't follow procedure, and then they end up giving you medals for breaking the rules. Both: Shit happens. - So you save a few lives, get the publicity. Who does all the work, huh? - Why, you do, sir. - What do I get for all the headaches and the ulcers? - They gave you that dalmatian paperweight, sir. - I warned you, and this time, it's gonna cost you boys. - Payoffs, sir? Our role model is resorting to payoffs? - Extortion is a serious crime, captain. - Recertification, boys. - Huh? - Recertification. Remember, boys, you not only have to pass your tests, you need my evaluation and recommendation, especially if somebody is looking for a scholarship to medical school. Fat chance. Now, because of your hotdog heroics, the chief won't let me fire you yet. So I decided on the next best thing. Effective tomorrow, both of you are being transferred to south central during the red alerts. It's a real crisis, you know, the next 48 hours. Have a good time, boys. Why the long faces, boys? - I burned down a fire station, and all you Caesar brothers bring me are three livers? - All the other parts were burned. - I want human organs. I don't care if they're well done. Hearts, kidneys, lungs, even a mucus membrane, but no more livers. What about your contact with the intern at mid-city? - He's grabbing everything he can get his hands on. - Only so many were dead. - It's not good enough. - We can't make accidents happen. - Well, I can. Get ready for a gang fight near the tracks tomorrow. - ♪ Beautiful day in the neighborhood ♪ ♪ a beautiful day for a neighbor ♪ ♪ would you be mine could you be mine ♪ - Come on, this could turn out to be an existential experience. - Great place to come if you only had a week to live. Seem like a year. - We're only here for two days. - Yeah, it only takes two seconds to get killed. I spent my whole life getting out of a neighborhood like this. - Come on, you grew up behind a mall. - I clawed and scraped my way. Man, I could have been somebody. Hey, I'm serious. Just when I'm this close to getting my own garage and body shop, I got all my money together-- - all right, all right, would you stop and remember why you became a paramedic? - I get to drive fast. - Yes. - Through traffic. - Yes. - No tickets. - Now we're thinking positive. - Okay, I'm positive we're gonna die. - Mike, you think that lifeguard job at the city pool has been taken? - Oh, here it is. don't touch it. Hey, hey, hey. No, not the windshield, not-- - here you go. - Thanks, pops, but it's already dirty. - All right. - Thanks. - Would you mind checking this address again, please? - There's the lizard, the snake. It's no use, buddy. This is it. - Yo, Charlie, send up that fresh meat. - Good morning. - Good morning. - Oh, man, - look at this place. - Mm, looky, looky. - Nice decor. Early colonial punk. - Reinforcements. Hip hip both: Hip hip hooray. - So y'all lose your way to the country club, gentlemen? - Mi casa es su casa. - Buenos dias. I'm farley. This is Maxwell. We're the new transferees. - Check it out, dudes. This is the gringo ringers from the good side of town. Both: Here they come to save the day. - Hi, I'm bennie bernitez, paramedic. Damn glad to meet you. How the hell are you? - Mildly amused. - What's happening, man? They call me brain damage. I don't know why, man, but lads, over here is me partner, the blade runner. If he likes you, he might let you call him blade for short, but don't call him [Indistinct], or he'll kick you up your kilt. Come on, look alive, lads. Look alive. - Where do we put our stuff, blade? - Name's blade runner. - Mm-hmm. - Gentlemen, we have two suites available. We have the penthouse, and we have something that's tres magnifique. It is a real knockout, a lanai with a city view. - I like the lanai. - Lanai. - Gentlemen, welcome to painville. - I hope you boys won't be too disappointed. The tennis court is just not quite finished yet, Yvonne. - Now, blade, honey, don't you be scaring our customers like that. - Well, I have to read you, girl. - I get the tent. - All yours. - Is the pool heated? - Yep, and jacuzzi's back there. We're gonna show you the Polo grounds a little bit later. Now, before you muchachas get a little too comfortable, why don't you follow me? - Walk this way. - Fore! - This way. - Gentlemen, I'd be very happy to introduce you to the rest of the staff. That's Trent. - Yo. - And Saul. Here's hyman at the bidet. That's Murray. Now, over there is Moses, the coach. Get out of there, Felix. Now, he's working out the strategy for the next emergency. - Now, Moses? Moses, baby? - Yes. - The new recruits. - Oh, shit. Would you look at the size of that one? Holy cripes, boy. Fine. Ooh, fine. Boy, you are fine. Goddamn, look at those legs. You have got a nice haircut, boy. Look at you. Fine. I'll tell you, you guys look in great shape. Glad to have you on the team. Yeah, listen, I am captain Moses stillwell. We don't stand on formality around here. In fact, we don't stand on much of anything if we can help it. - Works for me. - As long as you get out there, and you kick some ass. Listen, we have had our asses kicked all over the city, but we coming back in the second half. It's the fourth quarter that counts. Listen, I'm working out some new plays, and you guys, pay attention to shit over here. Come over here. I want to show you something. Now, when this guy starts to come around this end, we got to have somebody to take him out. You-- are you looking? - Blade, why don't you tell our guests what these two extremely white guys at the shortwave radio are doing here at south central? - We be eight-odd emergency medical technicians. Two're pissing their pants every hour on the hour. Here we have breedlove and white, two volunteer emts, two insurance salesmen looking for romance and adventure in the crisis trade. We call them-- both: The flying albino brothers. - Now, somebody has cut our phone lines and scared the caca out of them. - We have to get word to our family to tell them we're okay. - And ask the head office if our beneficiaries collect if we're only dismembered. - And is it double indemnity if we're stabbed, and then we're shot? Absolutely, it should be a business policy. - That's ours. - Hi, you've reached uptown and mad Mike if this is an emergency. If not, leave a message, and we'll get back to you. - This is Marcy. Thanks for the checkup last night. I ache so much. I feel like I've been riding a horse for three days. - Right, what's-- - hello. - Why do we have people here? - Whoo. - Whoa. - Move, personal call. - Look at this. You got a cd player. - Marcy? - Check it out, man. - Bennie, bennie, please, I've got to call the registry. There has been a terrible mistake. Wilfred and I should never have been transferred here. - Oh, no, you just wait your turn. I got to call my bookie. - No, no, I got to call my doctor. I'm allergic to something. I don't know, the garage, the air. - Poverty. - Poverty, that's it. I'm allergic to poor people. - don't you like what we've done to the place? It used to be a tortilla factory. - Yeah, man, a fire bug, man. He torched our station. So temporarily, we had to hide the fire trucks on 34th street. - Whoa, whoa, wait a second. You're saying that the arsonist burned down your fire station? - We were out on call. - That's why we got to be thinking defense. - Yeah, I'm thinking evacuation. - Hey, wait, excuse me, but I think it's the damn cops that's got to work on their offense to nail these blazing skull suckers. - Hey, man, the cops don't care, man. - Absolutely. - I've been saying that from the very beginning, but nobody listens. - No, no, man, the cops-- - get in line! - The lieutenant here will inform us as to what is being done. Lieutenant? - Good morning, gentlemen. I'm lieutenant holcomb, arson investigations. - You are kidding me. - Listen, curly, I never kid. - That's what I thought. - Got it? - Yeah, I was just saying that there's a time for humor and, you know-- - first of all-- first of all, we're not dealing with amateurs here, okay? This is a well-organized gang. They're using guerilla tactics here, men. - But this isn't exactly a hotbed for international terrorism. - Unless gadhafi's full of shiite. - Funny. - Now, that's--. - Listen up, blondie, I'm glad you men have a little levity down here, all right? Because you're gonna need it. Things are gonna get a little rough, and if that scares anybody, just let me know now. I'll make sure to write it up and send it to the big boys. You'll have no problem. - You know, as a matter of fact, I-- - okay. Forget it, forget it. I was obligated to ask that question, but it doesn't mean shit, the cold hard facts is that we're up there with our asses hanging out. And that's the way it is in the big city, okay? All right, now, I'm down here to try to help you guys. I'm trying to prevent you guys from getting shot. Any questions? - Sir, sir, sir. - Actually-- - I mean, ma'am. My partner and I make rather noticeable targets and I wonder-- - yes, Ms. lieutenant holcomb, if we could volunteer for police protection, that'd be breedlove, white, breedlove-- - and white. - Police protection program. - If it pleases lieutenant. - If it's not too much to ask. - Request denied. What a bunch of pussies. I can't believe it. - Lieutenant-- - red alert, all south central units, gang fight erupting at the corner of Heller street and sherve Avenue. The demonic mutilators and the Satan's scum are about to get it on. - That's us, homeboys! - Come on, follow us. - This is our big one. Strategize and pass the word. Now, listen up now, bennie and blade, they doing the end run. Now, the rookies, they're blitzing up the defensive line. - Yeah. Right. - Can we go over this again? - Very slowly, very slowly. - No, shut up and listen. - One more time, one more time. - No, ain't no reason. I'm gonna give you hand signals, all right? - Right on. - Let's go, let's go. Both: Yeah. - Woo! This is it! Come on! - Ooh, whoo. Ooh, I love this baby. - Hey, man, what's going on? What are you-- - what up, y'all? - Hey. - Possible stabbing, cranial bludgeoning. Now be careful, guys. There's gunfire in the area. - Did you hear that? - It sounded awful. - No, no, not that. That, that. Did you hear the engine? Did you hear that little ping? Isn't it driving a little funny? - Oh, oh, the engine. - The engine. - Oh, oh, that engine sounds terrible. Yes, yes. - Oh, something like that could get us killed. - Better get that checked. - Absolutely. They got this hemi so bored out, these plugs are getting a headache. Whoo, whoo. I'm pulling 500 horses on the back wheels. This sucker'll flat-out go, Jim. - Very good, very good. Hold the thought. Where are we going? - Huh? - You boys need directions? - Follow us for murder, mayhem, and mending. - Let's go. All: Mutilate. - Mute, mute. All: Mutilate. - Mute mute. All: Mutilate. - Mute, mute. All: Mutilate. - Mute mute. All: Mutilate. - Mute, mute. All: Mutilate. - Mute mute. All: Mutilate. All: Satan's scum, Satan's scum. All: Mutilate. - Mute, mute. All: Mutilate. All: Satan's scum. All: Mutilate. - Watch out. - Go, go. - All right, get over there. - They're shooting at us. - They're not shooting at us. What're they're shooting at us for, we're paramedics. - Yeah, go ahead and tell them that. So are these the blazing skulls? - No, this is just the normal stuff. - The vatos in the boxcar call themselves the demonic mutilators. Now, the vatos in the building is their enemy, Satan's scum. - They're fighting over who's gonna be numero uno. - Then what's this, the playoffs? - That's Pete. - Come on out! - Hey, man, what are you, crazy? - Hey, you shoot this mother, you're really in trouble. Son of a bitch. - Yeah, that'll teach 'em. - What the hell are the caesars doing? - How come no one's shooting at them? - I don't know. - I don't know. - Where's the meat? - Here. - Man, let's go up on the roof. - Amateurs. - A mutilator and a cop went down on the southwest corner. Wait a minute. We're gonna try to get down there. You guys, get ready to back us up, dig it? - Wait, wait, wait a sec. What do you mean "back you up?" Both: Ahh! - Move your shit, my man. - Viva la revolucion. I got you, I got you, man. Come on. - We got to rush these guys to the er. You guys, stay cool. Stay cool. Let's go, let's go. - What do we do now? - We wait until it's over. Sit down, watch them work. - Two minute warning. I'm sorry I'm late. What's the score? - Just about tied up. Satan's scum looks really good. - Whoo. - Now you're playing. 50 bucks says the mutilators wrap this thing up in another 20 minutes. - You're on. - Lieutenant, ma'am, ma'am, they got guns up there. - You call those guns? - I'm in the game now. Cover me, cover me. - Wait, don't-- - Moses, no. - He's in the open. He's at the 50, the 40, the 30, the 20, look at him go. Oh. Substitution, substitution. - Think somebody just called our number. - Substitution. Both: Oh, shit. - Hold it, back, back, back, back. Jump in here. - Climb in. Come on, let's go, and five and six and seven and eight. - Looks like I'm benched for a while. - Well, he's in rough shape. Got a gunshot wound in the right lateral clavicle and scapula. Listen. I think it's over. Maybe not. - Got to do something, partner. He's going to exsanguinate. He needs definitive care immediately. - Okay, here we go. Everybody! [Indistinct] Whoa. All: Scum, Satan's scum, Satan's scum. - Mute. All: Mutilate. - Mute, mute. All: Mutilate. - Paramedic. Eat this, paramedic. - Hey, you dropped something. - Great catch. - Oh, my leg. My leg. All: Scum, Satan's scum. All: Mutilate. - Mute, mute. All: Mutilate. - Is that the best you got? - Hey, look out, man. - Come on, man. - Look out, man. - Look out. - Watch out. - ♪ The one the only one ♪ ♪ under the sun, under the sun ♪ ♪ whoa ♪ ♪ don't be a player, girl ♪ - We got to get back to the west end, man. I mean, I can't take much more of this. I mean, people shoot at you when you're trying to help them. I mean, I was cool when that first big one came down, and I heard that whoosh, poof, and the one that went ch-ch-ch-ch-boom, and then pew, bop, and shooting, running like an idiot. Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-- - hey. - I got to get a hold of myself. - Better still, grab a hold of candy stripers on the right flank. - Mm-hmm. - Hey, what's going on? - Medical groupies at the far corner table. - Uh-huh. - And nurses all around. - I still can't handle meaningful communication. Both: The candy stripers. - If it isn't your uptight head nurse Savannah. - Mike, you got that remote doodad on you? - Yeah, doodad, kid. - Thanks, Mike. - Works every time. - Is this seat vacant? - It is now. Farley, I'm with a surgeon. - Yet, no one cuts as deep as you. - You roll your eyes like that, and a wave carries me onto the surf of your soul. - Thank you, rod mckuen. Now, give me a break. - Exactly. A breaker. - Before that wave carries you back out to sea, can I ask you something? How come you're never serious? No, I mean, I heard-- although it's difficult to believe-- that you're in line for a full medical scholarship. - Vicious gossip. However, I am the recipient of the Albert schweitzer- Dr. Ruth westheimer grant. - Farley, say good night. - You're in my seat, paramedic. - Oh, I'm terribly sorry, doctor. Allow me. - Stuff it, fella. - Now, doctor, I realize your vast experience at inserting suppositories might make a remark like "stuff it, fella" come off the top of your head like that, but I think you might have a little more respect for the lady here. Oh, you might start thinking about wearing a hat before someone slips a rubber over your head. - All right, now you try it. Listen to what happens to your heart when I put my hand here. - That's not my heart. - That's not my hand. You know-- - Christy? - Daddy? - Shouldn't you be home studying? - Good evening, chief Wilkins. I was just showing your daughter here-- who, by the way, is becoming quite a lovely young lady-- a cardiovascular technique that I've been-- - farley, good to see you. - Maxwell. - Maxwell. - Farley. - So you fellows have volunteered to work at south central. I never know what to expect from you boys. - Well, hey-- - well, thank you, chief Wilkins. I suppose you heard about captain Moses' injury. - Yeah, good man. Got to find someone to replace him. - You thinking what I'm thinking? - What? What? - What? Yes, yes, I am. - Especially on red alert. You are gonna need a man of courage. - A man with balls. - Who? Who? - Well, I do know a man who would risk his career... - And his pension to-- - get this job done. - Who, who? - A man of steel. - Yet sensitive to the problems. - Who is this man? Spit it out. - Honey, I'm going all the way to the governor with this. Bye, honey. - Sell him one kidney, two pancreases, all size nine. - One liver. - That's it. - Looking good. Come on. Man, big Hooters. Man, pancreas on the right. Mucus membranes on the left. - Flash, this just in. Critical knife injury at El quejido's restaurant. - Hey, just what we've been waiting for. - Lock and load, bubba. - You want to take it? - We're close, we'll take it. - Get lost. This call is ours. - How rude. If you want the call, just ask us nicely. - We're not asking you, man. We're telling you. - Hey, watch out. - Hey, come on, man. - Okay, boys. Time to suck my blast pack. - Excuse me. We need some directions. Which way is backwards? Much obliged. - Did we work out that little misunderstanding? - We sure enough did. - Which one's the patient? - I'd bet on the guy with his face in the guacamole. - You mean the one with the knife in his back. - Yeah, that looks like him. - Like-- ooh, that's messy. - Dude. - Oh. - I sure hope he's not a food critic. - I think he's still alive. - Hey, don't touch him. - Get out of the way, huh, buddy? - That man is El calamari grande. - Ah, the big squid. I speak Spanish. - He's still kicking. - don't you see? This was a hit. El calamari is a big mafia boss around here, and the blazing skulls want him dead, so don't touch him. You don't understand, man. This man's supposed to die. - Hey, kid, are you a relative, a close friend, or just a concerned citizen? - No, I-- huh? - Blood pressure, 80/60. - That would be a mistake. You're not listening to me. Hey? - Easy, big squid. - What's wrong with you two? - Mid-city, this is unit 66. - Starting iv ringer's, 1,000. Oh, if Savannah answers, tell her I can't stop thinking about her. - Yeah, we got a stabbing in the right quadrant at 17th intercostal and a guy who's crazy about you. Yeah, she said begin mass stabilization, and you're still a schmuck. - We're losing him. - Lose him. Lose him. Lose him. Save this man, and you're in danger. - Clear. - Stop, please, before it's too late. - Hey, buddy, huh? - Did you see him jumpstart that sucker? - We got to take him to mid-city hospital now. - Let's go, let's go. - You might be able to convince the doctors there to kill him. - Thanks for all your help. - Hey, where you going? - Where are we going? Six flags, where else? - You weren't stopped on the side of the road, were you? - Nah. - No. - don't you guys ever think of cleaning up this place either, hm? I do not appreciate walking on peanut shells in my bare feet. - Oh, those are roaches, sir. Unsalted, but we've taken precautions, captain, look. - I'm going [Indistinct]. - Three, two-- - I'm so tired my hair hurts. - Yeah, well, no place like home, huh? - Well, look who's here. - Is that a hair net, or are they prepping you for brain surgery? - Well, surprise, surprise, surprise. - Ooh, feeling a little edgy, huh, captain? How about a cup of decaf? Well, welcome to the station. Night, cap. - One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. - And one and two, and one and two. - One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and eight. - Hey, just a minute, wait up. And where do you think you're going? Right in here, dispatch. - don't you worry, cap. We'll be back before you finish your coffee. - You're not going anywhere. You're still on duty. - Standard procedure, captain. We get the morning off for our test. - That was before your emergency assignment. - We got our recertifications today. - I know. If you set one foot outside this district, you're in violation of county code. You cannot desert your post in a crisis situation. - Wouldn't that be a catch-22? - How would you like to catch a boot? - No, sir. No, sir, thank you. - It's all on the wheel, boys. What goes around comes around. Anyway you look at it, today is your last day. Croissant? - It's all on the wheel, Mike. - Alert, all available units. Three freeway shootings at I-55. Pit bull attack on temple street. - Let's go. - Train derailment on regency street overpass, and last but not least, somebody has flooded the ywca pool with ky jelly. - All right. Hustle up, hustle up. Whoo. - We're gone, we're gone. - Will you get over here? - Look out. - Let's go, I got-- - four patients requested to mid-city hospital. This is unit 66 en route to scene. Please advise, over. - Captain Prescott says you're to proceed immediately for field stabilization at the banana stadium rock concert. - Damn. That prune puss is going to make sure it's like this all day. - Finally got us by the nads. He knows we're not gonna risk somebody's life to pass a test. - Hey, I'm not losing my job on account of that turd. Croissant. - No, no, no, no, you're not thinking positive. We're gonna-- you got to find a way. Just relax. - Okay, I'll relax. What are you gonna do? - Yeah, I'll-- - well, that ought to work. Hey, I can stay in the game behind all his bs, but what about you and your scholarship? I mean, that test is so freaking easy. - Tell me about it. Room temperature iqs. - I'd pass it in my sleep. - I can phone it in. - Ooh, ooh. Both: Thank you. - Hey, get down with your bad self. All: Bye-bye. - Mr. farley, an oral examination over the telephone is highly irregular. Yes, I'm aware of the south central crisis. Yes, the shootings and stabbings, the muggings, the maimings. Yes, even so, Mr. farley, this exam is serious business. I couldn't possibly-- chief Wilkins. Well, in that case, Mr. farley, you have until 5:00 P.M. to complete your phone-in test. Yes, I want to go home early. I'm not feeling well. All right, Mr. farley, first question is for you. What is the treatment for a mild anxiety attack? - Hey, who's gonna pay for my new roof? - Hey, cool it. - I beg your pardon? - Sorry, Dr. lido, go ahead. - What is the treatment for a mild anxiety attack? - Move it, you asshole. - I beg your pardon? - Give the patient oxygen. - Oxygen. Oh, very good. What are the symptoms of an oncoming heart attack? - Shortness of breath, sweating, dizziness, dull pressure pain in the chest radiating into the arm. - Oh, yes, very good very good. Oh, god. All right, how do you treat an accident victim with a broken leg who's bleeding profusely? - Okay, assess the abcs, airway, breathing, start to report the status. If the problem's not the fracture, we stabilize the leg and splint it. - Yes, resetting the bone is possible. Yes, preparing a hare traction splint. Yes, go on. - You know, you don't know my mind. - Yeah, yeah, sounding good, right? - Yeah, eat it. - Look, we've been here for 20 minutes. Time's up, let's go. - I ain't going nowhere, man. - I can see that. - don't touch me, and I'm burning up. - I know, man. - You don't know nothing, man. - The hell I don't. I know you, man. It's like looking in a rearview mirror. Friend of yours? Come on, buddy. - All right, all right, come on, man, I'll rip your eyes out. - The hell you will. Alternative medicine at work. - And that, ladies and gentlemen, is why they call him mad Mike. Yeah, whoo-hoo. - Did you hear about the guy who went in to have hemorrhoid removal? - Mr. Maxwell, give your immediate response to a patient suffering from aggravated hiatal hernia. - I think I misunderstood that question. - And the surgeon amputated his legs? - It's a little bit radical. - The guy sues and loses his case 'cause he didn't have a leg to stand on. - Not bad. - The answer is paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, something we see out here in the field every day. - This is not official business. Get off this channel. - Pardon me, Jack, but I work alone. Get your own show. - Come again. - I'm sorry, Dr. lido. We're having a little radio trouble. We'll get back to you. - Do you two really think that this recertification phone scheme will work, ey? Bullshit. - Hey, loud mouth, this is my last warning. Get off my show. Both: Come on, Ms. dis! - Put me back on the air. - Thanks, Ms. dis, we owe you one. - Correction. You owe me two. Good luck, sweeties. - All right, now, we got to fight fire with fire. That's it, man. Prune puss has finally stepped over the line. - Now, I've been thinking of a grand maneuver that's gonna settle this dilemma once and for all. - As good as the time we got him and his wife seats for the hooker's harvest ball? - Oh, better. - Better than when we made him grand Marshall at the gay pride hayride? - Yeah, much better. This is gonna be incredibly humiliating, something so abjectly degrading that prune puss will never bother us again. - I like it already. - Next question's for Mr. Maxwell. What is the code word in the event of an emergency childbirth? - Look out, watch it. Son of a bitch. - That is an incorrect answer and an erroneous assumption. Next question. - Uh-oh, we'll get back to you, Dr. lido. - Man, god. Look at my bumper. - Better let me handle this. I speak airline. - Go get some oxygen. - For whom? - Mademoiselle, can I get you anything? How about if I return you to your original upright position? - Gentlemen, where are you? Go home, pop. I'm only doing this as a courtesy to you and chief Wilkins, who god knows has never done shit for me. - Mademoiselle, you are perfect. - I am very fine feeling. - Mm-hmm. I know that's right. - My name is liette. - My name is Mike Maxwell. - And my name is father time. Ticktock, guys. - Liette-- - I need-- very important-- at what time do the oysters arrive? - Breedlove and white, there's a food poisoning at the golden paradise. No wimp excuses. - Do we want to take that? - Food poisoning? - Food poisoning, food poisoning. Sure. Piece of cake, can of corn. We'll be heroes. - Oui, is simple, yes? - Pretty much. - Well, huh? - Wait, wait, wait, wait. - Yeah, he don't understand. He's-- what? Can you read this? And I will get that fixed. Yeah. - She's picking up a heart? Authorization for transport of human organs. - Human organs? To Paris from mid-city. - Oui, mid-city. Paris. - Hey, I get it. Get on the horn and tell them the girl's on the way. - Oh, while you keep an eye on the patient, right? - Yeah. Liette-- ooh-- - mid-city, this is unit 66. - Your condition demands close, personal attencion. - Attencion? - Yes, and I'm here to, like, give you close observation. - Observacion. - I think she likes me. - Course she does. She doesn't speak English. We have a little problem. Mademoiselle, la car vanished. - Vanished? - What happened? - Her heart, a kidney, and a whole lot of livers, all gone. Police are checking it out now. - Well, how can something like that just vanish from mid-city? - I don't know. The computer's on the horn right now trying to get her another heart. - Liette, you come with us, and I promise you I will get you a heart. - Even if it's yours. - All right, when a kidney stone gets passed through the male-- - sir? - You know, when a man passes a kidney stone through his do-wacky, his wee-wee-- - are you referring to the male penis, Dr. lido? - Zee-zee? - Penis, penis, I can say it. Male penis. Isn't that a little redundant? What is the procedure that follows? - No, don't play with it. It'll pop out and spray. - Oh, you're so graphic, but it works for me. - Me too. - Yeah, here we are. Yeah, right place. - Have you seen the valet? Who's gonna park this thing? Walk right here. - Watkins, Mr. Mikey Watkins. - We're here about the food poisoning. We're paramedics. - Ooh. - Oh, god. - This is breedlove. We need backup. Code three, code three. Possible multiple injuries, contusions, neck injuries-- mine! - I want everything that belonged to farley and Maxwell cleaned out of here. I don't want to be reminded of these guys. Come on, let's move it. - Telephone for you, sir. - Yeah? Who? Nurse who? Yes, I remember you. We met at the emergency services convention. Yes, yes, it was. Yes, I am. Yes, you were. I mean, you are. Well, you want to meet me there today? I mean, now? Well, yes, yes, I will. The one nearest the emergency entrance. I got it. What are you looking at? - Beautiful day, sir. - Blade runner, bennie, white, breedlove, we're just a few minutes away from operation-- both: Star search. - Calamari! - Breedlove and white, you assholes. You went to the wrong restaurant. It's the golden paradise, not the golden parachute. - Oh, you are idiots. Both: Ow, ow, ow. - This is a bad one here. - Hey, come on, man, don't touch him. - Not you again. Can't you hold a job? - What are we gonna do with you, squid-ly? That's twice in 48 hours. - Madre de dios. - I wonder what he's saying. - don't you speak Spanish? - Of course I do. He's saying madre, mother something, I don't-- - I speak very fine-looking espanol. - She's great, huh? - Yeah, it's outstanding. She's translating Spanish into French. - Liette, wait in the truck-cion. - El calamari is saying, "leave me alone. I'm supposed to die." - A paramedic is saying, "work with us, please." - You cannot change what must be. - Sorry to stand in the way of progress, pal. One, two, three. - This is the second time you've endangered your lives. The blazing skulls will now go after you. You must let him die. - Definite paramedic material. Got a one-track mind. - Yeah, and it always leads to El calamari. - Remember, I warned you. - Carry on, boys. - Whoa! - Right that way, sweetheart. - ♪ It's a beautiful day in every way ♪ ♪ hm hm hm in every way ♪ ♪ that's why I'm here to save the day ♪ - Whoo-hoo. Everything's ready. - Whoo-hoo. - We got the video equipment. - All right, mouse. The flying albino brothers here yet? - Nah, man, they dropped off their stuff before checking into physical therapy. - And what about Savannah? - Coming through. Hot food, coming through. - Savannah, don't you worry. It's all been cleared through the hospital administration. We're doing a little documentary on emergency procedures. - Well, wait, no. No, no, wait a minute. Farley, you cannot bring this type of circus in here, no. - What, circus? You call this a circus? What kind of a childhood did she have? - I don't know. - Farley, what the hell are you up to? - Dr. Saul wants to see you upstairs. You're needed in or. Nurse helms called in sick. - Okay, thank you. - Stage one complete. Genius, Mike. - Hey, genius, it's five till five. Dr. lido? - Test-- phone. - Do you know who I am? - Beast. - Right. - Dr. lido, are you there? - Gentlemen, gentlemen, this has been a very trying day for me. I told you I must leave by 5:00. No, I don't have time to-- - come on, man, help us out. - Come on, Dr. lido, please, there's one minute left. Give us a break. - Very well. Answer one last question, and you'll pass the test. - All right, shoot-- come on. - Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on. Get Ms. dis, we'll go through dispatch central. - Ms. dis, Ms. dis, this is mad Mike and uptown. Are you there? Are you there? - No, but I'm close. - Ms. dis, listen to me. We need your help. We're gonna get prune puss. - You're gonna get prune puss. What can I do to help? - Come on, Ms. dis, lido's gonna leave. - All right, gang, here's the question. Yes, yes. What does a paramedic use a brown paper bag for? - Crap. - She's not repeating the question right. - Come on, Ms. dis. Can you make sure that's the exact question Dr. lido asked? - That's what he said. Oh, go on, daddy. When does a paramedic use a brown paper bag? - I give-- I don't know. - She's hyperventilating. - Hyperventilation, hyperventilation. - The patient breathes into a brown paper bag to restore the balance of carbon dioxide. - You didn't have to act it out, dear, but we're very glad you did. Congratulations, gentlemen, you passed the exam. - Check it out. - Oh, yeah. - South central called. Prune puss is on his way. - Come on, guys, why so down? Pick up the tempo. Both: One, two, three, four. - Hey. - No smoking, gentlemen. - You're beautiful, baby. - Oh, look, look, look, look at this. - People. You people either get your insurance cards ready or leave the premises. - Roadie-- or not. Camera. - Will this do? - Very good. - Hey, what's happening today? Anything special? Anything I need to know about? - Film-- film at 11:00. Yeah, let's go. - Blade runner. - Prune puss is here. - Prune puss is here? - Prune puss is here? - Let's go. - Okay, stand by. - Five, four, three, two, one. - Action. - Oh, hello, hello, hello. So nice to see you undressed. Maybe we should kiss 'em, hm? Nurse helms, you nasty thing, you. - I'm so sorry. Damn paramedics never believe me. - Paramedics? What the-- what's the meaning of this? Paramedics? - Life has no meaning. Isn't it just enough just to be? In other words, dance with me, you fool. Come on, show those cups what you got. Oh, oh. - That's it. Yes. - Careful going down, big boy. Oh. - Maxwell. Where's that son-of-a-bitch partner of yours? I might have known you two are behind all this. Damn you, farley. Not only will you be off the force, but I'll have your asses in jail. - This is no boating accident. Sleep, sleep, sleep. - Cut and print it. That's a wrap, gang. Yeah. - All right, all right, come on out. Take a bow. - Everybody, come on out. You kids were terrific. Leather and lace, captain. Leather and lace. Oh. - There he is. - And bow, that's it. You know, captain, because of your hotdog heroics... - Which we have recorded for posterity on vhs. - The chief wouldn't let us fire you. Yet. - But once he gets a look at this video, he'll probably say-- - you animal. - Why the long face, captain? - Help. Help me. Oh, god. - Oh, welcome. - Oh, welcome. - Let's be light. - Oh, what fabulous costumes. Oh. - I looked death straight in the face and then spit in its eye. Blood, guts, nothing fazes me. Breasts faze me. - Hmm. - Silicone. - Whoa. - Breasts and bullets faze me. - What, didn't like the creamed liver? - Hey, I'll give you $5,000 for that heart. - Cash? - Whoa, wait. - Huh? - In here. - Get me out of here. I want some skulls. - Got three more livers in the towel room. - I am up to here in livers. - So that's what it's about. - Hm. - Let's go. - Here, quick. Wait, I forgot something. - What? - Liette. - Oh, my god. Savannah. - Farley, no, I'm not in the mood. I'm going-- - you've got to help us. The whole gang of killers are after me and mad Mike. They've got Uzis and machine guns. Two of them are paramedics. They're trying to sell human organs on the side. - My god, what an imagination. - Quick, they're right behind me. - Sorry. - Run. - Farley, that's enough. Farley, stop it right now. Now, don't you know when to stop, farley, huh? - Savannah, they're right-- they're right behind me, Savannah. Come on, come on, come on. Savannah, Savannah. Open the car door. - Farley, enough is enough. - There we go. There-- Savannah. Start the-- start the car. - This is embarrassing. - This is really embarrassing. - Oh, here we are, here we are. - Farley, what do you think you have to prove by doing this, huh? - Check the bus. - Tell the plain, simple truth. - All right, the plain, simple truth is I'm not very good with women. - Wait, what? - I never know what to say to them, especially you, Savannah. - Oh, my god. Wait, is there a problem? - So I make up all these outrageous stories because I want-- I want you to like me. - Farley, I've always liked you. - Really? - Yeah. Wait, do you see how easy that was? - Yes, I do. Yes, I do. - Okay, did you want to go some place, huh? - Mm-hmm, absolutely. Let's go. - How about grabbing something to eat? - Whoa. - Oh, my god. Aren't we the eager beaver? - Beast went up your alley. Jump in, quick. - Thank you. I hope he doesn't expect a tip. - Hurry. Get in, get in, get in. - Whoo-hoo-hoo. - Whoo-hoo. - Uptown, mad Mike, talk to me, talk to me. - All units, code three. All units, code three on the roadblock set from the corner of letbridge and Plymouth. - Good idea, buddy. - Two paramedic trucks. Let the first past, I know him. Grab the second one. It's carrying stolen human organs. We're being chased by two lowriders. Correction, one lowrider. - Uptown, skulls, 10:00. - Oh, my god. - Suck foam, skull. - Hang on. - Good. - Hang strong. Hang on. - Some first date, huh? Whoa. - I hope that's a stethoscope in your pocket, farley. - All right, hold it right there. - Hey. - Yeah. What are you doing? - Look at this. From frank. Le coeur.

I can do that policy for $600 and I throw in disability. Oh, and $430, no deductible. - Wilfred, both: Sell that policy. - Yeah. Whoa. - Ooh. - Need any help, ma'am? - Both of us? - Wouldn't that be kind of dangerous? After all, danger is our business. Come on. - Whoo. - Ho. - Wilfred, it's your turn to drive. - You're going, go. - What did we do to deserve this? - Come on up here, you guys. - All right. - All right. - All right. - I never know what to expect from you boys.
