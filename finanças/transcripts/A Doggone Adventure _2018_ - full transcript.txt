[crickets chirping] [owl hooting] [suspenseful music] [engine roaring] [dog whining] - It's okay, Pal. They haven't spotted us yet. I'm not going to let 'em get you again either. [dog whining] I like that. Nice resounding vote of confidence. [alien sounds] - They're here. They're here! There's a turnoff ahead, plenty of overhanging branches. Hold on, Pal, we're going to loose 'em in the woods right now! [tires squealing] [gasp] [alien noises] [tires squealing] [engine turns off] [dog whines] [crickets chirping] - Well, that put the brakes on 'em, didn't it? The only thing is though, they'll just keep comin'. I'm going to have to leave you, Pal. There are plenty of good people out there. You just got to make sure you choose the ones you can trust. All right, come on. It's all right. You'll be okay. It's okay. All right, now listen to me. Listen to me, all right? You're a very special dog, you know that? One of a kind in the whole universe. And you and me, we're pals, aren't we? [dog whining] We got a bond that nobody can break. But, I gotta let you go, you understand? Otherwise, they'll catch you. They can find me if they want, but you, you can hide, Baby, all right? One more thing, your mind is as vast as all of space. It is. It's a great gift. The world's just not ready for it yet, that's all. No more time for goodbyes, you gotta go, all right? All right, you listen to me, you run. You run! You Run like the wind! You understand? Go! Go! [dog barking] [dog barking] - That's it. [sniffs] That's it. [alien space noises] [suspenseful music] [dog barking] - Get you a cool drink of water, little fella. [dog whining] - I don't know where you came from, but I'm keeping you. I don't know why but I get the feeling you want me to call you, Murphy. Okay. Okay. Murphy. Murphy it is then. You don't ever have to be afraid again, Murphy. Never! [suspenseful music] [alien noises] [suspenseful music] - Let's do this [film reel spinning] - Blah! - Real funny. - Come on, this house isn't haunted. - Says you. - Says my dad. No such thing as ghosts. - Yeah? Well, there's been a bunch of strange noises coming from that house for years. - It's a real mystery. Really. - We've been here a half hour now and nothing! - Jeremy, develop some patience! [groans] - Guys, stop bickering. Let's go inside. - I'm not going in. - Don't worry, Ricky, that's what the drone's for. - I've been practicing a lot at home. I've gotten pretty good at it. - Yeah, he's only broken two windows and freaked out the cat. Wouldn't come out of the attic for a week. - Can you please stop? - Well, he didn't. [alien noises] - What was that? - I don't know, but it sounded bad. - Maybe we should just get out of here. - I'm with Ricky. - Me too. - Davy, can we do this another time? - We came here to solve a mystery. Like Dad on TV, right? Everyone with me? Mega views on our YouTube channel, money, fame. - All right, I guess. I'm in. - Jenny? - You're hosting again? - Yeah. - Why? - Well, I mean I can't help it if I'm just right for the part. - Why don't I host this time? - But you're a girl. - Ricky, that's not-- - Girls don't host TV shows. - Oh, why don't you call Kelly Ripper and tell her that. - Daytime. - Samantha Bee. - Cable - We're talking YouTube here, David. - Okay, fine. You got me. Next time, I promise Everybody set? - Ready. - Ready. - Wait, my coat. - You look just like dad. - He kind of does. - Now. - Slate it. - Unresolved mysteries, take one. - The supernatural, the mysterious, the unexplained. Do ghostly spirits still inhabit the most darkest and despairing houses? And most for-boarding houses. Do ghostly spirits still inhabit our darkest and most bu-- - [Jeremy] Foreboding. - and most for-boarding-- Do ghostly spirits still inhabit our darkest and most foreboding houses? - This is going to be awesome! - We are in front of the old Cannejo Mansion. Abandoned for nearly 80 years it is said to be haunted by the demented soul of its former owner, Ralph Cannejo. - Ralph, Rabbit? - Let's get that drone in the air. - And cut. [propeller humming] - It's so cool, it can go almost anywhere. - How are you going in? - It's kind of puny to ram it through the front door, don't you think? - Second floor, broken window. [propellers hum] [suspenseful music] - We're in. Let's check downstairs. Good picture too. - I know, right? Looks scary, even from out here. - Glad I didn't have to go in there for real. [piano playing] - What's that? Who's playing the piano? - I can't watch this. - Dave, turn the drone back, quick! - Still don't believe in ghost, Jeremy? - Maybe this wasn't such a good idea. - We're committed. - You should be committed. - Stop. Stop. Let's go upstairs, take a look. [door banging] - Over there! - I see it! I see it! [door banging] [suspenseful music] [cat meowing] [children screaming] - Classic cat scare. [sigh] [alien noises] [children screaming] - Run! Run! - [Jeremy] Go. Go. Go. - [Jenny] Let's get out of here. - Dang it! - Come on guys. - [Jenny] Forget that, let's head for the bushes! - Come on! - Go! - [Ricky] Wait for me. [laughter] - Look at 'em go, why don't ya. - We scared 'em but good. Hey, how'd you come up with alien lobster scream? Fantastic. - Years of watching science fiction movies. - Oh. Think they'll be back? - Would you if you were a kid? - These masks, all I've got to say is, good thinking. - Mm-hm, we had 'em, we used 'em. And, we scored a neat-o mini-drone in the process. - Oh, yeah! [laughing] So, what now? - Well, back to business. [panting] - Aliens! - Aliens! - Aliens! - Isn't it great? - They can't have been aliens. - Can't have been. - No such thing, right? - They were aliens, just like on Dad's show. - But that's a TV show, Ricky. - What are you saying? - Why don't you tell him about the tooth fairy while you're at it, Brainiac. - Huh? - Never mind. - So, what now? - We go home and check out today's footage. - I think we got some really good stuff. - I think Dad's going to love it. It's just like his program. - Do you think they'll catch on? - Who, the shoe company? They don't care. - They care if they're being bootlegged. - Whoa, we're not bootleggers, we're entrepreneurs/ Buy cheap shoes, add a free logo, sell it online for a hundred bucks. We make money; the people who make the fake logos make money. It's a win-win. Nobody gets hurt. Nobody. Come on, let's speed this up. - What do you think this is, I Love Lucy? [laughs] - Oh right, with the-- Come on. - The supernatural, the mysterious, the unexplained, I'm Steven Hill, and this is Unresolved Mysteries. The time, 5:15 PM. The date, October 7th. The place, a dusty road in New Mexico nearly six years ago. Doctor Roland Masters, speeds along a desert road something unknown. Something witnesses claim was not of this earth. Masters, a former employee at the Galactatek Research Facility left his job early that day, but was not missed for over an hour. - It's okay little guy, they're not going to get ya. They may get me, but not you. I'll see to that. - According to a former Galactatek employee who was willing to speak to Unresolved Mysteries under the guise of anonymity, Doctor Masters took with him the super secret project he had been working on. One local farmer was an eye witness to what transpired next. - I was putting my goats back in the barn and all of a sudden these two wild saucers come blaring by in the sky. This guy, he was in a car trying to escape, but he finally gave up, and pulled off to the side of the road. This is when it got really interesting. These saucers were just floating there. Just floating. They're making this noise. [humming] Very irritating noise. [humming] [yelling] And then, he goes up. This little puppy was there just staring at the whole thing. This was very overwhelming. I, I, I still don't believe my eyes. It's aliens! [groans] - Just exactly what happened on that ominous day may never be known for sure. Why did Doctor Masters suddenly plan his escape? What is the intriguing secret he was so anxious to keep from the world? Goodbye, and keep watching the sky. [panting] - There it is, just like before. - I don't understand, we all saw the aliens now they're not there. - It's just static. Did you do something weird, David? - I dropped the monitor when we were running away. But wait, maybe I can still get a clear frame or two. There, that's the best I've got. - It's kind of there, but not really. - I see it, David, clear as day. - You might see it, but no one's going to believe us on that. - My dad will. He's solved cases with much less evidence than this. - Yeah, you're right, Rick. And, he's going to be home a lot more now. Maybe this is our silver lining. - Silver lining? - Yeah, we haven't told you guys this yet, but Unsolved Mysteries was canceled. - Oh man, I'm sorry. - He'll find another show to do. - I hope so. [garbled sounds] - So, what was the source of the mysterious five-tone signal? Will we ever know, or will it remain, unresolved? As many of you know, this is our last show, and we wanted to thank you for three years of dedication. From the cast, the crew, goodbye, and keep watching the skies. - [Director] And cut. - Thank you everybody, it's been mysterious. Thanks everybody. Thank you. - Patrick! - Thank you, Steven. - Oh, thank you very much, brother. Nice work, as always. - Hey, Steve, where would you like me to put this stuff from your trailer? - Uh, just put it in the back of my car, it's open, Billy. - You got it. - Cool. Thank you. Thank you guys. Everybody. You've been-- I like you a lot! [laughs] [panting] Billy, was born in a barn. [engine starting] [dramatic music] - [Computer] Incoming message. [beeping] Incoming message. - Sorry to interrupt, sir, but I think we may have gotten a hit - On what? - The dog, sir. - Was the satellite imaging retained? - It's here, in New Mexico, right here. - Get our best operative on it now. The chip has been react-- [dramatic music] - [Radio] Galactatek security mission,Team A1. Jack Bowser is in pursuit of female operative. Descending for a closer look and additional surveillance and possible backup. [dramatic music] [train chugging] [beeping] [beeping] [beeping] [beeping] - Surprise. - Darn it! - Hi, Jack. - Come on, Jack, how many times do I have to tell you, don't lose sight of the quarry. Technology isn't enough. Thank you Miss McGillicuddy you can leave now. - Thank you dear. - Let me help you. - Jack! [grunts] Turn it off. [train noise dies away] [groaning] I think I may have dislocated my shoulder, or worse. - I could put that back in. - Get away from me. [beeping] - Natasha, drop everything, Crowder wants you. I think we may have a problem here, Zoey. Jack, you klutz. if you broke my arm... - What do you mean she broke her arm? - Yes, sir. - And I get Jack Bowser? Cheese and crackers, Williams, can you do nothing right? [groans] - Are you all right? - I liked it when Dad was on his show - Yeah, but at least you get to see him more. - But I liked seeing him on TV. Do you think he'll really help us with our case? - Yeah, sure. He'll-- [honking] It's Dad. - Dad! Dad's home! Come on! - Ricky, wait up. - Hi, honey. - How's it going? - Daddy. - Hey, buddy. - Did you have a good day? - I did. How you doing? - Wonderful. - Yeah? Good. Good. good. Ricky, can you grab something out of there? - Yeah. - I got a bag. You got it, bud? - Yeah. - [Steven] Good. - Go, go, go, go. - Here we are boys. And this is okay to eat with your hands. - Ah, ah, wait until your mother sits. Thanks. - Honey, it will be good for you to spend the summer with the kids, and then you'll just walk into another shown next season. - Yeah, I don't know about that. It's just that these shows, I think their days are done, you know? - Honey. - No, no, we are going to be fine. We are going to have a great summer - We sure are, Dad. - Oh, check this out. - What have they been up to? - I have no idea. - What is this? Look at that. - Don't push the button, you're as bad as they are. - It's on now. [panting] - There it was, Dad. Did you see it? - I don't know, I saw something. - It's just like your show, Dad, but like real life. - Well, if I learned anything doing my show it's that, extraordinary claims-- - [family] Require extraordinary proof. - Yeah, well you did say you dropped it when you ran away. Maybe some sci-fi footage bled in or something. - Come on, dad. - Ghost in the machine, son. Ghosts in the machine. - There's a ghost in the machine? - No, no, no, it's just an expression, Ricky. It's okay. Listen, I'm really, really happy that you guys are figuring things out, that you're looking into things. In fact, I'm proud of you. It shows great instincts. How about this, I'll make you a deal. If you guys give me a day I promise to go with you to the old Cannejo house, and we'll figure this out together. Yeah, okay? - Okay. - Okay. - All right guys, ribs aren't going to eat themselves. - Hey, get some food, guys. [panting] [dramatic trumpet music] - The dog is back. - The dog's back? Dog's back? Dog is back. The dog is back. Dog's back. Doggie-- - It's not code, Jack. He mean's Murphy. - Oh. - Which means, he can lead us to Masters. - Professor Masters? - Well done, Jack. - But we have him in custody. - What? - No, no, Jack. - Uh, yeah. I saw it on Unresolved Mysteries. - No, Jack. No. That's reality TV. It's not real. Not real, Jack. But we did have him close, hands up ready to give up. - But? - The dog was Galactatek property, and Masters stole him. Now, the GPS chip went off when they left the facility. We dispatched a reacquisition team on a pair of prototype anti-gravity sky sleds. When they finally cornered him Masters set the dog free. Vanished, not seen for six years. - Sky sleds. - That seems like an awful lot of trouble for a runaway Jack Russel. - That's no ordinary Jack Russel. Masters altered the dog's brain giving him human-like thought, even telepathy. - That's nonsense. - Well, believe what you want, just get me Masters and get me that dog. - On my way. - Why'd you break your arm? - He broke my arm, sir. - Get after him. Try to keep him alive. We need his father's money. - Got it. Anti-gravity sleds? - Let's just say they were reverse engineered. - From what? - I'll let you figure that out. - Dad's right, maybe those space creatures we saw weren't really there. - But we saw them. - We saw something, but it might be what Dad said. - [Murphy] mind if I take a look? - You've seen it a million times, bro. - I didn't say that. - Well, who did? - [Murphy] It was me, Murphy! Whoa, whoa, whoa, easy kids, easy. - Where are you? - Show yourself before I call my dad. - Yeah, come on out, slow and easy. - [Murphy] Well, that's good, because that's the way I always roll, kids. Now, here I come. No swinging or throwing. - No promises. - [Murphy] Okay, I'll trust you. - Whoa! - Whoa! - Double whoa. - Make that a triple. - [Murphy] What's the matter? You guys never met a dog before? - Not a talking one. - [Murphy] Well, technically I think at you, kid, but I understand the confusion. - But how do you think at us? - [Murphy] Uh, now that's a mystery even I haven't solved yet. I figure we could swap cases. I help you with your crazy aliens, and you can help me find out why I'm the only dog who can do this trick. - But dogs do lots of tricks. - [Murphy] I don't see Benji, or Beethoven doing this one. - How'd you get here, Murph? - [Murphy] I hitched a ride home with your dad. - Are you an alien? - Really? - [Murphy] Funny you should ask. All I know is one day I was puppy doing puppy stuff, and the next day I could read Aristotle, in the original Greek, thank you. Oh, that feels good. Hey, mind if I take a look at that video? - Yeah, sure. - [Murphy] Mmm, very interesting. - What do you think, Murph? - Is it a real mystery or just bad video? - [Murphy] Well, it's hard to tell. Back at Galactatek they got some nerd who could freeze the frame and enhance the image, but I'm not going back there, even for you guys. If only I knew someone like that out here. - Why didn't I think of this sooner? - You're right, he'll figure this out in seconds. - [Murphy] Who will figure this out? - The brain! - The brain. - Yeah, he's a genius when it comes to electronic stuff like this. - [Murphy] Well, get him over here. - It's too late, it's almost dark, but we'll take you to the clubhouse first thing in the morning. - Yeah, that's where all of his cool stuff is. - [Murphy] Okay. Hey, if we're not, you know, sleuthing any chance I could snag a few scraps from tonight's leftovers? - Sure, no problem. - Yeah, just wait right here. - Should we tell Dad? - No, wait. This is our mystery, we don't need an adult to help us. - Okay, okay. - [Murphy] Are there any ribs left? - Plenty. - [Murphy] I love these kids! [thunder] [rain falling] [spaceship sound] - [Robot] Sir? Sir? Wake up, sir. - Wilson, is that you? - [Wilson] I fail to see who else it could possibly be, sir. - What time is it? - [Wilson] Some ungodly hour as usual. There's a perfectly good bed in your perfectly good bedroom, sir. - Has there been a breach? - [Wilson] Uh, no sir, no breach. We remain secure. - Then why did you wake me up? - [Wilson] I thought it would be funny, also, they found your dog. - Murph? Where? - [Wilson] New Mexico, sir. at the residence of a man named, Steven Hill. [laughs[ - Oh now, they'll be waiting for me to come and get him, won't they? - [Wilson] The probability is they are more interested in the dog than you, sir. - Well, I'm going to go get him anyway. arrange my transportation. Use the standard misdirection protocol. Pack me a small valise, and, oh, remember to get my umbrella. - [Wilson] Whatever you wish, sir. - Oh, Wilson, where would I be without you? - [Wilson] You'd be a complete wreck, sir. - Most likely that's true. - [Wilson] I'll fetch the car, sir. - Oh, and don't try to engage it in conversation, Wilson. It's just a car. - [Wilson] That car has a lot to say if you care to listen. [chuckles] [muffled speaking] [beeping] - What are you listening to? - Yeah, that's odd. - Creep-o-man. - Yeah, Shelton, what gives? - Well, I'm trying to get the telemetry from the ISS, but this is what I got. - [children] Weird! - So let me get this straight, last night you two found a talking dog under your bed? - Correct. - And he agreed to help us with our mystery if we help him with his? Does that about sum it up? - That's the deal. - Some deal! Go fish! - No, really. - No, really. - Then where's the talking dog? - Come on guys, extraordinary claims require-- - [children] Extraordinary proof! - [Murphy] How's this for extraordinary proof? Hey kids, what's the plan? I love a good plan. - This seems highly unlikely. - Unlikely? You're making this seem possible. - [Murphy] Hey, nothing's impossible, kids. - He's a dog and he's talking. And he's a dog, and he's talking - Technically he's thinking, but we understand your confusion, right Murph? - [Murphy] That's right, Rick. - This fits no mode of terrestrial reality. I need to under-- - Shut it down, Shelton. You're drowning us in your words. - [Murphy] Don't let her get to your, bro, it's good to be smart. - So, what's the deal, pooch? - [Murphy] I wish I knew, Blondie. That's why I need you guys to help me solve the mystery of why I can do what I can do. And in return I'll get the alien puzzle unraveled before the sun goes down. What do you say? - I'm down. - Me too. - I guess we can't say, no. And after all, you are talking. - [children] Thinking. - And besides, you're cute. - [Murphy] Aw, shucks, thanks, Jen. I haven't had this much love and affection in a dog's age. Hey Brain, were you able to enhance that image? - Best I can do in short notice. - What do you think, Murph? - [Murphy] Frankly, I think someone's got to go in that house and find exactly what's going on. - My parents will ground me if they find out I went inside! - Never mind my parents, I'm not going in because I'm sane. - [Murphy] Okay, here's the plan. You guys can wait outside, and I'll go in! - Are you sure, Murph? - Yeah, it could be dangerous. - [Murphy] Danger is my middle name. Actually, it's my dad's middle name. Cautious is my middle name. What have I gotten myself into? - Fascinating. - Well, how we looking? - We're fine. - For a month? - No, for the summer at least. - I just-- People, they think you're on TV and you got it made for life. - Sweety, I really don't want you getting depressed. - It's not about the money. I mean I know we need the money and everything, but I just-- I like TV, you know? - And TV likes you. - Yeah, for three years. - Oh, should I get you a tissue? - No. Okay. Okay. I'm sorry. It's just I like telling stories and solving mysteries, entertaining people. - Yeah. - And the boys were proud of me. - Baby, the boys will always be proud of you. - Thanks, Hon. [knocking] [groans] - Yeah, can I help? You're Roland Masters! I did a show about you. - I'm a fan of your show. Of course it wasn't really accurate, was it? And those crop formations, is not what you think. - Well, it's TV, so- - Yeah, all right. You mind if I come in? - Yeah. No, please. Yes. Yes. - Here. - Uh, nope. Sorry. - Yeah, me neither, but I think the kids might have. - What? - Well, last night's rib leftovers were under Ricky's bed. There was a water dish under there too. - And when were you going to tell me this, Hon? - Well, you know how we had been talking about getting the kids a dog. I was just waiting for the right moment to tell you that maybe they'd already adopted one. - I'm confused though, why is it your dog? I mean why is Murphy here? - Well I know he was here. His recently reactivated GPS chip told me he was here. It actually told Galactatek he was here, and then Wilson my robot told me. - Wilson, his robot. I'm going to go fetch the kids. - Would you like a cup of coffee? [suspenseful music] - I'm on the freeway now. - I know you're on the freeway, Jack. Our eye in the sky is following you. - Yeah, I'm headed west towards-- - Towards Exit 24. Jack, and the school. I know! Okay, we're going to need to talk about what you're going to do there. - What I'm going to do? - You're gathering Intel. - Right. - About? - About the children, Jack. - Children? What about children? I thought I was after a dog, specifically a Jack Russel. - Terrier! Yes, Jack, I know. Please just listen to me. Try to stay on point, okay? - You know, you mentioned something about children, what if I go check out the elementary school? - You're on your way to the school now. Exit 24! - Can't talk right now, I'm exiting Exit 24 right now. [phone ringing] - Principle Callahan's office. - [Maurice] This is Maurice in maintenance, put him on, put him on! - I'm sorry, you'll have to call back. He's on the other line and he has someone from Galactatek Security waiting. - All right, all right, but you tell him the evac pipes are clogging up again and it's getting bad down here. - Will do. - Listen, sonny, don't be so cavalier about this, if they blow it's not going to be pretty let me tell ya. - I'll tell him. I'll tell him. - You do that. - Okay, you did two things wrong. - What? - One, is you asked a question, and two, you asked another question. - [Student] But what if, what if I-- - Listen son, you better get that term paper in, or you won't believe what happens next, even while it's happening. - [Student] Okay, I'll get it done I promise, I promise. - I'll see you at school next week. Bye. So, let me get this straight, you're from the Galatek people, and you expect me to fall in line and answer your questions? - It's Galactatek, one word. - Are you messing with me now? - Don't get drawn in, Jack. - Let's reset, sir. I'm just here to ask about the Hill boys. - Well, they're exemplary students, not trouble makers. What's your interest in the Hill family? - What's my interest in the Hill family? - Mom's a real American sweetheart. She makes chocolate chip cookies for the PTA meeting. - Really? - No, not really. I make the cookies. And I use shortening and not butter, and semi-sweet chocolate chips. How's that for your gender stereotyping? - Tasha? - What? You got a tick? What you got in there? You running a scam on me, you glass-jawed punk? - No, sir. - You ever met one of those guys you shouldn't have messed with? Well, I'm that guy. Listen, you ever come back here, giving me the third degree about my kids, it's going to get real ugly, real fast. - I think we're done here, Jack. [phone ringing] - Principle Callahan's office. - [Harry] Get my brother on the phone. - [Secretary] Principle Callahan I have your brother Harry from Frisco on line three. - Tell him, make my day. - Hello inspector, he is unavailable, but his message was to make his-- - [Harry] I know, I know, make my day. Our mother always said that when we were in deep straights with her. - You still here? - Boy, he seemed hostile. - You think? Listen, I just got a new reading from the chip, Murphy's about two miles from the school. - I'll need an exact fix. - Just get in the car, Jack. I'll get you there. - Copy that. [alien noises] - It's our pipes, they're old and they need replacing. - Your boss, he's tough, real tough. - You should meet his brother, Harry. - Harry Callahan of Frisco? Got to love it. [boards creaking] - [Murphy] I don't know about this. I don't know. - Well, there it is. - Yup, there it is. - [Murphy] Yes indeed, there it most certainly is. - So, you going in, Murph? - [Murphy] Now that I see it in person it looks kind of scary. - I thought danger was your middle name. Chickening out? - Murphy doesn't chicken out. - [Murphy] I'm no scaredy-cat, but I'm occasionally an apprehensive dog. - But you said you'd-- - [Murphy] All right, all right, I'll do it. But remember the plan, if you hear me start to scream who you gonna call? - We know who to call, Murph. - [Murphy] Okay, this is me heading over to the haunted house, which I know in my mind isn't really haunted, at least I hope not. Besides, it's me Murphy the Wonder Dog, and I ain't afraid of no ghosts. [phone ringing] - Are you going to answer it? - It's Dad. - Don't answer it. - [Murphy] Well, it doesn't look like there's any way into the spooky place, too bad. Oh, except for that hole, in the wall. Darn it! Got to stick to the plan, let's go. - I hope he'll be all right. - He'll be fine. - Don't worry, Ricky, dogs run faster than ghosts. - How do you know? - Never watched Scooby-Doo? - Well, I watched your husband's show. You know, he's pretty good. -Yeah. - How is it that a real-life cop winds up being the host on a TV show? - Well, he was involved in solving an alien abduction hoax. And it was actually pretty high profile, do he did a bunch of TV interviews and some high mucky-muck in Hollywood saw them and thought that he was going to be a good fit, you know? - Just one question though, how sure are you that it was a hoax? [stammering] - I mean, what? [phone ringing] - Excuse me, phone call. Ah, [laughs] it's Wilson my robot. Yeah, Wilson. - [Wilson] Sir, I have an update. the dog is less than a quarter mile from your current position. - All right, just send me the directions. - [Wilson] All ready done. - You do know that your attitude is literally adjustable, don't you? - [Wilson] If you're going to talk to me that way, goodbye, sir. - Well, I have to go and get my dog. - Uh, huh. Are you in trouble? Are my kids going to be safe? - Look, Murphy is a very smart dog, Mrs. Hill, and if he's with your kids they're going to be perfectly safe. Thanks for the coffee. [sigh] - [Murphy] These kids are going to get me in big trouble, but big trouble is my mom's middle name. What's that? Oh, it's just a noise. A noise from down there, from the basement. From the creepy, crawly, ultra-dark,spider-filled, bat-infested basement! No fear! No fear! No fear! - David, Ricky, you guys up there? - They're not here, Mr. Hill. - Oh, hey Shelton, I figured that they would've been here. Do you know where they are? - Ummmm. - Come on, that's a pretty easy question for a smart kid like you. - They didn't want me to say. - Let me take a wild guess, are they at the old Connejo house? I appreciate your candor. - Yes, sir. - Oh, hey, Shelton, let me ask you another question, how the heck do you get Wi-Fi all the way out here in the middle of nowhere? - Who, me? - That's what I thought. Tell Ricky and David I'm looking for them if you see them. - Yes, Mr. Hill. Man, they're going to get it. - [Murphy] Man, what's all that racket? Hey, wait a minute, ghosts don't operate machinery. Maybe I should wait until their lunch break. Wait just a cotton-pickin', ghost-pickin', minute. That doesn't reek of ectoplasm, that smells like Robeks. - Been a while now, hasn't it? - Yeah, I hope he'll be all right. - Should we go in and check on him? - Give him a few more minutes and then we'll all go and take a look. - Can't wait! Creepy aliens, talking dog. [phone ringing] - [Murphy] Ah, no evil spirits in this dump, - Hey, thanks for picking up the drinks, buddy, came in handy. - [Murphy] It's just a couple of clowns. - Better than coffee, pal. And I really feel like it's given me the extra energy boost we needed. - Why you talking like that? - I don't know. It just felt right. - So does this tasty beverage. - [Murphy] Wait a minute, they're putting on an act, scaring everybody away. [barking] - Hey, that mangy mutt got in here. - Let's get him before his owner comes looking for him. [clunk] Ow! [grunting] - Go, go, get him! [grunting] [barking] - [Murphy] This will fix 'em! - What's he doing? Oh no, no, no! No, no, no, no! - [Murphy] There's a shoe! Gazoontite. [grunting] [shrieking] - [Murphy] I'm out of here. - It hurts, it hurts! [grunting] [groaning] - [Murphy] Now here's some good slapstick potential. [laughs] I can't watch! - Go get him! [men panting] [screaming] - Is that a ghost? - Get a grip. I know it's a haunted house but we're looking for aliens here. [barking] [yelling] - [Murphy] Adios, suckers. [screaming] - Oh, that wasn't so bad. - Says you, you jerk! - Let's get him! Come on, come on, let's get him! - Someone's coming. [crash] [barking] - Gotcha. - Who are you? - Jack Bowser, private security operative. - That sounds ludicrous. - [Natasha] It does, Jack. - Could you once let me do this without yacking in my ear? - Who's in your ear? - The most annoying person in the world. Now, I'm taking this dog, any problem with that? - You're not here for us? - You? No. - So then, we're... - Free to go? - Well, you could stay here if you want, but I wouldn't. - Hey, he's taking Murphy! - What are we going to do? - What the what? Suddenly it's Grand Central over there. - Come on, let's go down there, maybe they can tell us what happened. - I look forward to our Amber Alerts. - Don't worry buddy, I'm not going to hurt you. You're a tough little guy to get a hold of, they've been looking for you for six years. Hey, you hungry? Thirsty? - He's talking to the dog? - Should have brought some bacon. You know what, there's a strip mall a couple of miles up, what do you say I stop and get you some water, huh? - [Murphy] Some big spender you are! How about a mochaccino, Cappuccino, extra syrup, Latte? - You're thinking at me, that's cool. - [Murphy] Wow, you're the first one to get that right. - And now he thinks it's answering. Oh boy. [barking] - [Murphy] Hey, you must be really smart. I like you! - Like you too, buddy. - So, you're the owner of Murphy? - That I am, and I'm afraid he's in the clutches of the Galactatek corporation now. - I mean he's cute and all, but what would a multinational research and technology conglomerate want with a dog, cute or not? - You getting this? - Not a word. - They don't want Murphy, they want his brain. [sighs] - Uh-oh. - I think you'd better explain. - Well, you've heard stories of downed UFOs, and flying saucers that crashed and wound up in Area 51, right? Well, none of that's true. - I thought so. - See the Galactatek Corporation had a contract on all that alien stuff decades ago. Area 51, that was just a coverup. - Oh. - We worked the Roswell remains, reverse engineering everything from alien micro-technology to complex chemical and biological interfaces. The aliens had created living computers. - I knew it. - Shh, he's flashbacking. - And we knew that amazing information, the secrets of the universe, of life itself, were all locked inside this bizarre biotech computer. But all we had were rudimentary means to communicate. But then I found an inert gene from an alien DNA matrix, - So what'd you do with it? - Well, I did what anyone would do, I implanted it into a puppy. - [Children] Eww. - Say what now? - Sounds a bit Frankensteiny doesn't it, and maybe just a little bit nuts, but it worked! And this little dog was suddenly blessed with these supernatural intelligence that well, even exceeded my expectations. - It took a smart dog to outfox us. - But when the CEO, Crowder, got wind of what I did, he smelled money. I couldn't bear to think of what they might do to Murphy inside those labs of his, so I took him. - Well, that is quite a story, Doctor. - Dad, how long have you been here? - Long enough. David, Ricky, what did I tell you about coming out here alone? Run along home. - Okay, Dad. Okay, when we walk by the old guy, make a diversion. - What? - Distract him or do something cute. - Why? - Just do it. - I liked your story, mister. - Well thanks, pal, that means a lot. - Jeremy, Jenny, you too. - Yes, Mr. Hill. - And who are you two? - We're realtors. - Yeah, yeah, we're thinking about fixing the place up and flipping it. - Well, I wish you luck. And as for you, Doctor... - Whoa, where'd he go? - Whoa, he was right there. Hey, you look familiar, I've seen you somewhere before. - Detective Steven Hill. - Detective? - Hey, you're that guy on TV, right? The guy with all those crazy mysteries? - That's me. - Hey, do you think anything the Doc said was legit? - I don't know, that's why we call them, unresolved. - Because it's unresolved! Oh, oh! - What do you think he means, dummy? - He means it's not resolved, - Not resolved, right. Good luck, guys. - Yeah, hey, nice meeting you. Wow, the guy's on TV. [barking] [alien noises] - [Murphy] And that's how it all went down, I swear. It was the scariest night of my life. And that includes that hamburger incident in Barstow. But I digress. Anyway, this old man found me as soon as Doctor Masters left, I was so lucky! - Gotcha. Oh yeah, I know, those flying machines buzzing around all the time. Fella, you're shaking like a leaf. - [Murphy] He took me to his cabin in the woods, not far from here. And I was under their noses the whole time. But the old man knew his stuff, maybe he'd even worked for Galactatek at one time, or something. Anyway, he knew how to block my GPS signal, and then one day he just stopped coming home and I was all alone. You're going to lock me up, aren't you? - Look, it's not me, I was assigned to find a dog, I didn't realize the dog was going to turn out to be such a great guy. - [Murphy] Well, thanks for that. - Jack's here with the dog, sir. I think he may need a vacation, sir. He's talking to the dog, And he thinks the dog is talking back to him. - I need the dog back in the lab, don't let anything go wrong. - Was the talking dog not news to you? - What you looking for? - I'll tell you when I find it. - Can I help? - I know exactly where it is. - Where what is? - This! - What's that? - Well, it's an old telephone called a land line. - Why? - Who knows, but if you plug it into the wall it works just like your cell. - How do you know that? - I saw it in an old movie. - Why don't you just use your cell? - Because I dropped it in the doctor's pocket right before Dad sent us home today. - Dad's not going to like this. - Trust me, it will work. [phone ringing] - Hello? - Hello Doctor, this is David Hill. - David, you know this isn't my phone. - Yeah, I hid it in your jacket. - What would make you do something like that? - Because the gang and I are going to help you get your dog back. - No, no, hold on, David, that would be very unwise. - Yeah, that's why we called you. Because you worked for Galactatek for such a long time, maybe you could help us get on the base without setting off any of the alarms. - Hold on, let me think. Why not? - All right, all right, I think I have a plan. - Great, we start tomorrow. - What a day! - Do you think we have to worry about those kids? - Na, they'd never sell us out. - No, but I might. - What are you doing here? - Well, I was hoping to ask a small favor of you two gentlemen. - What do you mean by, favor? - It's the kind of favor that will allow you to keep your licit business flourishing, as well as helping me get back my dog. - Do we have a choice? - Not if you want to keep selling these silly sneakers. - Hey, what do you mean by-- What do we have to do? - Well, I need a couple of aliens, and, uh, I'd say you boys fit that bill. - How come Masters is sitting safe and sound back at the clubhouse while we're out here risking our necks. - I don't know. [phone ringing] Oh, shh, be quiet, that's him. Hello? - Status? - Status? [laughing] Check this guy out, he thinks he thinks he's on an episode of 24. - We like more like we're from the Outer Limits. [laughter] - Status... quo. [laughter] - Well, how are the kids? - Oh, oh, the kids? Yeah, they're fine. Not a peep out of them. - Remember what I told you to say when you get to that gate. - Yeah, I remember. Hey, what do you think you're dealing with, a couple idiots here? [phone hanging up] [busy signal] - Hello? Hello? - Got 'em! Just southwest of Rock Ditch heading towards Chainsaw. - I think we're slowing down. - Yeah, this could be it. - Everyone ready? - I'm like lunch meat, I'm always ready. - Lunch meat's gross. - You're gross. - Stop bickering! - Hey, that's my line! - And I didn't understand it then either. - Shh, we're stopping. - What have we got here? - Rosswell's about 100 miles that way. [laughter] - Funny. - We're here for Doctor Suberon's birthday. - You don't seem to be on our list. - You don't have a list. - Well, call him up, they've been planning this thing for weeks. - Joe, call Lab 7, see if Suberon's throwing a party today. - You got an X143 going on up there? We got a pair of rental crabs here at the gate. They say they're here for Suberon's party. [garbled speech] - Watch this! [garbled speech] - [Man] Confirmation, party on schedule at 14:30. - It's okay, Suberon's party starts in 15 minutes. - Well it looks like you guys are clear to go. You know where you're going? - Lab 7. - Lab 7. [laughter] - Hey, and no sightseeing. Tell birthday boy to bring down some cake. - Will do. - I'm watching you. - [whispers] Go. - [whispers] Go. - Mmm. Alien clowns. - I don't like crabs. - All ashore who's coming to ashore. - Okay Doc, we're over by Lab 7. What now? - Well now, it's an educated guess... - Educated guess? - A highly educated guess. They're going to have Murphy in quarantine in a small room on the other side of the lab. Now, you're not going to have access to that, so you're going to have to walk through Lab 7 to Ge there. - So, how do we get in there? - Once you find the access door just punch in the code that I gave you last night, remember? - Oh, yeah, just like that, huh? Four kids and a couple of nut job aliens just saunter in. Real easy. - Look, look, people are used to seeing weird things around that place, okay? Just stay calm and walk quickly. - You mean run? - No! No! No! Do not run! Just don't stop to gawk at anything, okay? - All right, got it. - Okay, stick together, keep your eyes forward, and no talking. - Right. - This is kind of cool. - It's just like one of Dad's shows. - Whatever. - Do all of you have to have the last word? - Wait, does anybody need to go to the bathroom? Not you! All right, follow us and try not to look like kids. Come on. How are we going to do that? - Attitude, Ricky, attitude. - I bet ya she's real fun on a camping trip. - No kidding! - [Murphy] Hey, my canine intuition tells me there's a rescue attempt in the making. [barking] - All I can say is, whoa! - Double whoa! - Make it a triple. - No one's ever going to believe us. - This is like the room I always wanted. - [Murphy] It's the kids, I know it. Come on guys, you can do it. - Do you hear talking? Do you think they're talking about us? - Wouldn't you? - Yeah, because to them we're the aliens. - I don't care what they're saying about us. Come on, we have to find that dog. - Right, because I'm boiling in this costume. - [Murphy] I think they're getting close. [beeping] [latch opening] [door banging] [gasping] [barking] - He's over there. - Hey, did you see a giant crab man just now? [panting] - There's a couple of guards between us and the lab. They don't look as dumb as the ones up at the gate. - That was some plan your pal the Doc had, kids. - We should bale. - Yeah. - We can't get Murphy? - You ready to do something good for a change, pal? - All right, Freddy and I are going to distract the guards and get them away from their posts. - And if the guards take the bait you kids run in there as fast as you can and get the mutt and get out of there. - How do we get away? We can't drive. - Oh yeah, uh... make your way to the truck, we'll meet you there. - Why should we trust you? - Give us a chance, kid. All right, on three. Three! Take us to your leader! - We're here to subdue your world. - Yes, earth shall ours. [alien noises] - Hey, what's the gag? What are you guys doing here? This is a secured area. - We don't care, we are invaders from Mars. - Okay, wait a minute, let's see your badges. - Uh, our badges? We must have left those in our other alien costumes, the ones with the pockets. - All right, that's it wiseguy, here, now! - Uh, run! - Hey, they're getting away, hit the alarm button now! Get them! [alarm bell] - Murphy! - [Computer] All security doors will be closed in 60 seconds. - Go! Come on. Come on. - [Computer] All personnel report to your designated posts. - [Murphy] I knew you guys were coming. Is the Doc with you? - No, but we're taking you to him as soon as possible. I need something to hide you in. - What's he doing? - I get it. - Great! - This will have to do. - [Murphy] A backpack, are we going to college? - Oh no, a security alarm just went off at Galactatek. - How do you know this? - Because I hacked their system. - I think the NSA is going to wanna have a talk with you, son. - I can find out. - No, no, not needed, kid. - [Computer] All security doors are now closed. - They're not here. - Nice plan, minus the getaway. - Don't worry, I know how to get out of here. - Care to share, smart guy? - [Murphy] What do you got lined up? Tell me you got a limo. - Not really. - [Murphy] Taxi? - Nope. - [Murphy] Look, I'll settle for a rickshaw, but that's as low as I go. - None of the above, we're going sky surfing. - [Children] Sky surfing? - [Murphy] You mean like surfing on nothing? - Yeah, it's the only way to get you out of here, Murph. Come on, follow me. - [Murphy] I don't think I'm down for surfing on nothing. Guys, wait, let's talk about this. Stop! - All right, come on, get in there! Get in there both of you! Look at you two crabs [laughs]. Want some sushi? I'm just joking with them, they got to move their claws like that. Hey, something smells fishy, don't you think? It smells fishy! Okay, we'll leave these two guys the octopuses. All right, don't clam up. You hear what I did there? I said, clam. I said, clam up. - Looks like the kids swiped the dog. - Yeah, but how are they going to get out of this dystopian nightmare? - Dystopian nightmare? Don't over sell it, buddy. - That's our way out. - Do you think we can fly them? - We're going to have to. - [Murphy] Is that the only option? How about a plan B? - We don't have time Murph, do you want to see Doc Masters again? - [Murphy] Uh, is that a trick question? And do we have flight insurance? - [Computer] Galactatek is now in lockdown. - What's going on? - They got the dog! - What? How? Forget it, just get it back! - [Computer] Sled activated, ready for command. - I just need this thing to fly. - [Computer] Affirmative, prepare for liftoff. - Oh boy, oh boy, it's working. - [Computer] Ready for motion direction. - Forward! - [Computer] Forward, manual control. - [Murphy] I guess we're doing this. [gasps] - Come on guys, it's easy. - [Murphy] Easy, that's easy for you, you're not looking down. - [Computer] Prepare for liftoff. - Whoa! - Whoa! [screaming] - Whoa, this thing has a mind of its own. [yelling] - Do you think our parents will let us keep these? - Sure, they'll let us fly them to school. What was he thinking? - [Computer] Warning, approaching closed skydoor from the southwest. - [Murphy] Uh-oh. - [Computer] It is now quite close. - [Murphy] Who's got the garage opener? - Watch out David, watch the wall! - Well, what do I do? What do I do? - [Murphy] Why are you asking me, I'm dog. - Whoa, whoa, whoa! - [Computer] Warning. Warning. - Do something! - [Computer] Warning. - David, do something. - [Computer] Collision alert. - Open door. - [Computer] Affirmative, opening sky door. - [Murphy] Dogs have nine lives, right? [yelling] - [Murphy] I'm going to pretend I like this. - This is amazing! - I'm alive! I'm alive! I'm alive! - You good back there? - [Murphy] I'm a dog, I love wind in my face. [yelling] - I love sky sledding. - They got away! - A sky sled. - Sky sled? - Sky sled. - I've got to rethink this whole boy genius stay behind thing. [beeping] - I'll fly after them, I'll get them to land. - You? No, we, and I'll drive. - I'll drive! - You can barely drive a car! - Look at your arm, you can't drive. - Just don't kill us. - Us? - Just go! - Watch this, guys. - Show off! - Knock it off, Ricky. [screaming] - [Murphy] Will that kid ever stop screaming? - Where did you learn how to drive this thing? - I took an online tutorial, what did you think? - Come on, go faster! - I'm going faster. Stop backseat driving. This thing was only built for one person. - We've got company. - They're coming! - Do something! Do something! - They're coming from behind us. - This is getting real, real fast. - They're catching up. - What do I do? - Ask the flying doohickey. - [Computer] Activating extreme capture in 10, 9 - [Computer] Warning, capture being locked on, suggesting tactic defense number one, and hurry. - Um, distraction tactic number one. - [Computer] 5, 4, 3, 2- Malfunction, malfunction, malfunction. [gasping] - Good shot, David! [yelling] - Yeah! - Get the other one, get the other one! - There's still one more, no time to rest on your laurels, hot shot. [beeping] - Now what? [beeping] - Anytime, fly boy. - Okay, diversion two. [engines roaring] - Yeah! - Good shot, David, way to go. - [Murphy] Nice work kid, nice work. Thank you. - Full speed ahead. - Speed up, Jenny, come on! - Beat you there! - Those kids are pretty smart, I'm going to hang back. We'll catch up with them on the ground. - I think I hear something. - It's them! - [Murphy] Doc, Doc, it's you! Doc, I knew you'd come back for me. Doc, I've missed you, Doc. - Oh Murph. I missed you, baby. - [Murphy] I missed you too. I missed you, remember this? - [Murphy] Oh, I loved that. I loved that. Can we go home now? - Neither of you are going anywhere. - [Murphy] Well, why not? - I can hear him in my head? - [Murphy] Your girlfriend's a little late to the party, Jack. - What do you mean, girlfriend. - Professor, you both have to come back with us, I'm sorry. - Not so fast. - Steven Hill? I love your show. - Thanks, but it's been canceled. However I know a lot of people in the media who would still pay attention to me, especially if I deliver them a good story about about how a great big corporation treats people and dogs poorly. Masters and Murphy are like family and Galactatek is tearing them apart. - I don't make company policy, I'm sorry. - And I don't tear families apart. - But we have to write a report, right? - We would, if we had found the dog. - It's too bad. It's a shame we didn't find the dog. - [Murphy] She's kind of a softy underneath that tough spy chick look, Jack. - Oh no, she's really tough too. It's not just a look. But, but I like it. I like it. - Don't go spreading this around, but uh, I like you too, Jack. - Take it easy, Murph. See you later professor. - [Murphy] Goodbye Jack, you've been a good guy. - Come on boy. Well, all right, it's time to say goodbye, guys. Say goodbye to him. - Bye Murph, wish you could've stayed longer. - It's like we just met you and now you have to leave again. - [Murphy] Oh kids, I'm going to miss you too. - So long, you're the greatest. Wish I could have a dog just like you. - I can't think of a single wisecrack. I'm going to miss you, Murph. - [Murphy] You kids will always be my heroes. I'll keep you in my heart forever. - Bye, guys. - Goodbye Murphy. - [Murphy] I know goodbyes are a little bitter sweet, but David and Ricky are clever boys and they wrote a better ending. And here it is. - Unresolved mysteries take one. - [Murphy] Those little loveable tikes pressed on with their show. They got Dad to host it, even got Mom involved. And you know, somehow it all actually worked. Their show started getting viewers in the hundreds, in the thousands, in the millions. It went viral and suddenly the Hill family, and their internet show, were the talk of the town. It could have been the haunted houses, the aliens, or the crop circles, but you know what I think it was? I think it was love. With the family working together the show blossomed into something beautiful. They'd always had the mysteries, but now they had the magic. - Now I know it's true, no good dead goes unpunished. - Yeah, well, I'm still glad we did it. - All right you two, you're free to go. - But I thought-- - Yeah, well all the charges were dropped. If you could believe this, there was a million dollar reward. You guys can pick it up at the cashiers. Now come on, let's get out of here. This is my office, and you're stinking it up to high heaven. Let's go, come on, move it, move it. Let's get out of here, come on. Crab people. I hate crab people. * I'm ready for adventure * Ready to meet the world I'd like to know * Nature and its treasures * Doggone adventure, here I come * Find somewhere to go to see the sunshine glow * Maybe I will find what I need to know * I'm ready for adventure * I'm ready to meet the world I'd like to know * Nature and its treasures. * Doggone adventure here I come * Find somewhere to go to see the sunshine glow * Maybe I will find what I need to know * I'm ready for adventure * Ready to meet the world I'd like to know * Nature and its treasures. * Doggone adventure
