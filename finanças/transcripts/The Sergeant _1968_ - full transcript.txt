[birds chirping] [dogs barking] [gates creaking] [chirping continues] [dogs barking] [rustling] [guns fire] [machine gun firing] [firing continues] [machine gun firing] [firing continues] [grenade pin snaps] [machine gun firing] [explosion] [bulletsricocheting] [cocks gun] [gun firing] [gun firing] [gun clicks] [drum music] [panting] [music continues] [grunting] [choking] [cello music] [gasping] [gasps] [breathing heavily] [train chugging] [train whistling] [instrumental music] [engine revving] [music continues] You have breakfast, sergeant? [instrumental music] [music continues] [driver] 'It'll be turning cold soon.' [instrumental music] [music continues] [driver] 'Ain't much of a place.' [instrumental music] [drum music] [jeep revving] [gravel crunching] [instrumental music] [music continues] Morning. You the company clerk? Sure am. What's your name? Say, can I help you? Can I help you, sergeant? Yeah, you can help me. I'm reporting. Name's Callan, Master Sergeant Callan. Oh...you're the new first sergeant? That's right. Captain Loring isn't in yet, but he should be here anytime. The company's out at the mess hall and I'm just kind of.. ..holding down the fort. Would you like some breakfast, sergeant? What do you got the light on for? [sighing] Now, soldier, what's your name? Cowley. Corporal Cowley, sir. I'm a master sergeant of the United States Army don't call me sir. Yes, that's right. They all like you? How do you mean? [chuckles] It might be some time before the captain gets here. If you'd like breakfast, I'd be glad to see the cook about it. Maybe, you'd like me to get your gear squared away? I'll be fine, Corporal Cowley. You just...sit down. Try to relax. [vehicle approaching] [vehicle door shuts] At ease, sergeant. Master Sergeant Callan, is it? Yes, sir. We're certainly happy to see you, Callan. Two months without a first sergeant is no play day. Well...tell me how was the trip from the States? It wasn't bad, sir. My orders are on the desk. Yes, well, maybe we should take a look at them, huh? - Morning, Cowley. - 'Morning, sir.' Mm-hm. Oh, sit down, please. I don't see why we should be so formal. Oh, yes. [Loring] 'Oh, the old 41st.' Lot of infantry, huh? Ah, you've been in France before. Hm. 'Distinguished Service Cross.' Uh, it's, it's very impressive. Yeah, you've had a lot of infantry at.. But now, of course, it-it isn't infantry. I know it isn't, sir, but that doesn't make any difference as far as running a company is concerned. No, of course not, you-you're right. It's the same job in all the branches. Well, you have a fine record.. ...and there's not much new I can tell you. The most important thing, though, is to keep these men from getting too lax. Getting to feel they're like ordinary laborers. Mm-hm. [sighs] Well, sir, I think it's a pretty sad outfit. What do you mean? The huts are dirty, the bunks are unmade the company area is littered with trash the men run around half in uniform and half out. You've got a very critical eye, sergeant. [chuckles] Do you hold company formation, sir? They're maintenance men. We just didn't see the need for it. Who is "we"? Now, just a minute, sergeant. Certainly, sir. Look, captain, I've been, uh, I've been running companies for over 15 years. So...I don't think we'll have any trouble with this one. Now, supposing you let me handle it. I imagine it's a headache for you with your other duties. Just let me handle it as I see fit. Of course, you'll have the final say. I'll have the final say, of course. Of course. Well, fine. Fine. You're the kind of man I can have confidence in. Anything for me to sign, Cowley? No, sir. Alright, fine. I'll...I'll be in this afteroon then. [door closes] You're some pair, aren't you? [instrumental music] You know what you should do? You should make a memorandum and post it. Make a memorandum informing the men of this company will be in formation at 1800 hours. You can do that, can't you, Cowley? Company! Attention! I've brought you out here for a purpose. I'm your new first sergeant. The name is Callan! Master Sergeant Callan! I've called you out here because it's best we understand each other from the very beginning. You've gotten along without a first sergeant. 'You've gotten used to having your own way.' Well, allthat's gonna change! And it's gonna change right now! You can expect.. ...three formations a day. You can expect the daily inspection of quarters! And you can expect to conduct yourself like soldiers! At ease! Captain Loring has been occupied with other duties. He can't devote as much time to you as he'd like. Perhaps, that's made you careless. Perhaps, you think because you're a maintenance outfit you're not subject to the common rules of military discipline. Well, you're wrong. For example.. ...no man will ever again appear at formation in a uniform such as this. There's no excuse for such filth. This man is restricted to the company area for two weeks. [gravel crunching] Am I understood? [echoing] [instrumental music] What's your name? Swanson, Thomas A. - How long you been here? - Eight months. - Where do you work? - In the field. [music continues] What are you so proud about? [woman laughing] You think I should've bether tonight, Tom? Not me, Franklin. I'm too pure for that medal. Yeah, sure. Hey, what about that sergeant? 'He's gonna make life mean for us.' Funny, huh, Tom, the way he came down you out there? He got Clairey, too. 'Yeah, but singling you out that way for nothing.' It wasn't for nothing. It's because old Tom didn't scare 'with all that hard-nosed talk.' That's right. That's how it was. How do I look, Pop? Just fine, son. You look fine. Okay, old buddy. Give my best to the world. Going out, Swanson? Just into town. [door closes] [boys yelling] [yelling continues] [instrumental music] [music continues] Would you like to meet someone? [Swanson] 'Uh-uh.' No? Someone would like to meet you. [male #1] 'I know all about you.' 'And I disapprove of everything.' It is the sworn duty of her male relative, her brother-in-law to disapprove. 'Oh, yes.' Now, what can I offer you to drink? [speaking French] A whiskey. [speaking French] [speaking French] Oh, just tonight, I just come from the cinema. [imitating shooting] Yeah, an American film. Randolph Scott's. He makes me very happy. - Do you like him? - Yeah, he's okay. [male #1] 'Solange told me you're very intelligent.' 'A soldier who belongs in the university.' A young man with a great heart for life. [speaking French] Merci. So, this is where you had your first rendezvous? It's not much. It's not even romantic. Paul, please. You see, I know everything. I am her confidante. But you're not my confidante. I am her confidante. But it's incredible. I just mentioned that we met here. That is just the thing. If your father knew, Solange, or your mother...hmph! When I was young, girls were not permitted such a liberal way of life. And you, Mr. Swanson.. ...what do you think of meeting a girl in a cafe? Well, I think it's fine. [Paul] 'You do?' Yeah. So do I. [glasses clink] [accordion music] Well.. ...I'm leaving you with the bill paid. No-no, this is because at heart I'm really very nice, you know. Don't be silly, Paul. You're not going. It is a great tragedy, little one. I know. She's in your trust. [Paul] 'She's an exceptional girl.' Well...that's the kind of brother-in-law to have, huh? I'm glad you approve. [music continues] Hello. Hello. [male #2] 'Good morning.' - You in charge here? - 'Yeah.' - You want to look around some? - Yeah. Who told you to space them like that? 'It's so they won't set each other off.' [chuckles] Who told you that, the officers? Listen, you got a Private Swanson working for you? Yeah, Tom Swanson. [Callan] 'Where is he?' Out there. He works a crew of Frenchmen. - Is he good? - 'He's good.' 'He's not a smart aleck like most of these guys.' Sound like you're making up for him. I ain't doing that. He's about my best man. 'Nice, soft-spoken..' Yeah? Well, maybe I ought to take a look. Let me lock up the shack, I'll go with you. I'll find him. 'There's a lot of men out there.' I said I'd find him, sergeant. [steel drum rattling] Good crew there. Good work out of them too. [speaking French] - Merci. - Merci. They seem to like you too. [Swanson] 'Yeah, we get along good.' Why don't you come down here? What's the name of the sergeant? The sergeant of the depot shack? Sergeant Komski. Komski, huh? Komski tells me that you're, uh, pretty good. In fact, he tells me you're about the best he's got. That was nice of him. [chuckles] "That was nice of him." What'd you do in civilian life? Finished school. Worked around a little bit. Worked Madera, California, didn't you? 'Oh, yeah.' I checked your Form 20. [Swanson] Uh-huh. How'd you like to come work for me? In the orderly room? That's right, in the orderly room as the company clerk. I don't know anything about that kind of work. I don't know.. According to your records, you can type. Your intelligence, I'll leave that to my own judgment. I think you'd do just fine. Now, I've never done anything but field work. Oh, I'm giving you a chance. I appreciate that, but... you've seen my records. I've never been any farther than high school. Some of these men have been to college. 'They'd be better for that kind of work, wouldn't they?' When I pick a man for a job I do it because I know he can handle it. [Swanson] To tell you the truth, sergeant.. '...I've gotten to like it out here in the depot.' Maybe something's wrong here. I'm offering you a better job and you stand there fooling around. - I'm trying to explain-- - 'You're fooling around.' - Look, I don't feel-- - Shut up! Now...you're trying to tell me you don't want the job? I'll be damned. [chuckles] I'll be damned. Ho! Listen.. ...you better re-organize your thinking 'cause I can order you. But I won't do that. If you don't want the job, don't take it because nobody works for me that doesn't want to. But I'll tell you one thing boy, you better think about it just a little. Alright.. ...I'll think about it. You come work for me. [male #3] 'Man, what's he trying to do to us? Rotating guard duty.' 'Half-day workload on Saturdays.' The man can't change the place overnight. - He's doing it, ain't he? - Yeah. Where's the captain? He was in this morning, sergeant. "He was in this morning?" That's nice. What can I do for you, Komski? - It's about my wife, sergeant. - Yeah, what about her? Well, I mean, she's being shipped over. Coming over to join me here. That's nice. I've sure been looking forward to it. You didn't tell me you made these arrangements. Well, most of it was done before you came, sergeant. You got facilities, a house and all that? Oh, yeah. I've done all that. She'll be coming into Paris about a week from now. What I need, of course, is about a three-day pass. You think you deserve a pass? I've been waiting a long time. I haven't had a pass in six months. I didn't ask you that. I said, do you think you deserve a pass? You see, sometimes, you give a man a pass to see his wife.. ...and he winds up chasing whores. Oh, uh, you got the pass, Komski. And when your wife comes we'll...we'll do everything we can to make her comfortable. [door closes] Good afternoon, sir. I've got some papers for you to sign. Oh, yes. Yes, of course. Uh...thank you, sergeant. You're doing an absolutely splendid job of the company. You should hear the reports out there. Thank you, sir. Oh, here we are. You know, something's not right about him. Yeah, he's bad, alright. There ain't no denying that. I'm not exactly saying that. There ain't no use for philosophizing Man, it's simple. They get that many stripes and they think they're God Almighty. You know, I just got five months left over here. I'm just gonna do my work and Saturday night.. ...man, I'm gonna drink that good vin blanc. I'm not gonna do nothing extraordinary, no, sir. 'Cause that man..' '...he's the kind that watches and waits.' And when he gets the chance, boom! Man, you are in jail for the rest of your natural life. [Pop] 'He's a soldier.' Oh, what do you mean? I mean, he's a soldier. This outfit's needed somebody like him. He's old army. [laughs] Oh, man. Something you wouldn't know anything about. You go get him, Pop. - The son of a bitch-- - I know. I know, man. You gotta be damn near crazy. I know what you mean, sarge. I guess, I didn't even want the damn pass. You know, I'll tell you something, sarge. I got a feeling about that man. Right in my backbone. Let me have a beer.. You gettin' enough, Leroy? Tom...eating is the only way to beat this life. [laughing] [footsteps] [chuckles] Did I frighten you? Just sitting here thinking. Thinking of what? What a hard ass I am? I come out here from time to time. Sit alone. Drink a little. Kinda like you. Too damn hot in there. Too noisy. Mm-hm. [violin music] [Callan] 'Ah, that's kind of sad, that action out there.' 'Girls come from everywhere.' Some of them not much older than children. You got a girl? [music continues] Yeah. That's good. [laughing] I guess, uh, I guess I'm a hard ass. Listen.. ...tell you something. You see, when.. ...when you're in an outfit like this you kind of set yourself up as the law. Now, you do that.. ...and you're all alone. You're gonna come work for me, Swanson? You are gonna work for me, aren't you? Yeah, alright. Sure, you are. I knew you would. [instrumental music] [music continues] [Solange laughing] You know.. ...I never think of you as a soldier. I think of you always as.. ...just a young man who comes visiting from the country. Oh, yeah? [music continues] What kind of work do you do at the camp? Nothing much. Nothing important. But what? [Swanson] 'I'm just a soldier, Solange.' [instrumental music] [music continues] [dog barking] [Swanson] 'You know, when I was just a kid, my father died.' 'My mom and my brother and I went to work.' 'We lived on a great little street.' 'Elm trees and picket fences and all that kind of stuff.' I had a paper route. My own house was the last house I used to deliver to everyday. All afternoon, I'd be zipping around town delivering those papers. Then, I'd come down our street toss a paper onto the front porch swing into the driveway and zoom right down into the garage. And it was quiet. No wind at all. Right in the middle of the garage floor.. ...there was a big round spot of grease where my old man used to park his car. That spot of grease.. ...that was the friendliest thing I knew. What a nice story. [instrumental music] [birds chirping] [thunder rumbling] [Callan] 'Come on, let's go.' Move it! Come on, move, move, move! Okay, let's go. Come on, move. Do not fall asleep in the shack. Let's move! Oh, man, that's no rain, that's a flood. How'd you do? [Swanson] 'Okay.' Alright, come on now! Let's move, move it! Let me see. [typewriter clicking] Oh, you're doing fine, you're doing fine. That'll be alright. [phone ringing] Hello, yeah. Yes, captain. What can we do for you? I see. Well...I'll be damned. Says the roads are too slick to drive. He don't think he can make it in today. [Callan] 'Oh, yes, captain.' Yes, sir, you can count on us. Right, sir. He wants to know if we can manage without him. [chuckles] Well, I think I can run the company without him. [rain pattering] [instrumental music] Yeah.. Look, you're a little late on the roster, so.. ...you better come back in at 7. [Swanson] 'Sergeant, I only have a couple left.' I can have it done by 5. I'm sure you can have it done by 5, but I want you back at 7. I had a little something goin' for me in town tonight. You're kidding. - No, I was planning on-- - That girl? Yeah, that's right. I'll tell you something, Swanson. You're a soldier, you're not a playboy. So you get your sweet ass back in here at 7 o'clock sharp. [Aldous] 'Not going to town tonight?' No trouble with your girl? Nah. Well, now, my old buddy, I.. ...I still wouldn't say you're feelin' the best. Maybe, it's working for that man. You know, I've been wanting to ask you how it is in the office? You kinda touchy about it, ain't you? 'I think you thought some of us were sore at you' 'for taking that job, but they ain't.' Well, not that I know of. Hell, it ain't a free world, man. A man's got to take the job when the sergeant gives the order. Aldous.. ...what do you think of that man? I don't know exactly. Sometimes, you try and lean his way and tell yourself he's not doing nothing but his job. But then, you see things. What things? I don't know. Things. [rain pattering] [typewriter clicking] You like your work, son? Oh, wait a minute. Wait one minute. I can have him court-martialed for this. Don't do it, sergeant. I can bust him. I can do better than that. I've watched this one before. I can have him run out of service for being unfit. Let him go, sergeant, huh? For me. For you? Alright. Alright. Maybe, I'll let him go this time.. ...maybe. [honking] [honking continues] [car honking] [Solange] 'Tom!' You alright, Solange? - Huh? - I think so, yes. And you? Oh, geez, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Don't be that sorry. We're alright, aren't we? I've acted like a damn fool. I shouldn't have tried to pass him. - But we're alright. - I'm sorry, Solange. [indistinct chatter] But you're making so much of it. It's the accident, it's everything. I don't have good sense. What's really the matter? Hmm? Tell me. Is it something at the camp? [speaking French] You're drinking like an American. Tom.. ...I care about you. [chatter continues] - How you doing? - Fine. I don't much like this paperwork. Well, it's gotta be done. At night? [chuckling] [typewriter clicking] Listen, uh.. ...why don't you come outside? There's something I wanna show. Come on. [chair scrapes floor] Well.. ...here it is. Some lemon, huh? [dog barking] [men laughing] Where'd you get it? From some guy in the engineer's but I'm afraid he saw me coming. - What'd you pay for it? - Five hundred. It's too much? No. It looks good. [hood slams] You finished with the rosters yet? Almost. Why don't we take the bomb drive in town and have a drink? I got a date in town tonight, sergeant. - With your girl? - 'Yeah.' I see. What the hell, I can give you a ride in. Nah, that's okay. Come on. [dog barking] [Swanson] 'It runs alright.' [Callan] 'Mm-hm. It's alright.' [Callan] 'I'm a sucker for cars anyway.' And besides, a guy needs something. You can't hang around the camp all the time. You know that yourself. Here, do yourself a favor. [cork pops] 'You know where I got that?' Uh-uh. Right out of the captain's car. Wh-what do you mean? You just took it? That's right. He knows I took it. But he's not gonna say or do anything. Do you know why? Uh-uh. He's afraid of me. [organ music] [Solange] I thought we would be alone tonight. He offered me a ride. He looks strange out there. Why? I don't know. All this is so old... so beautiful. [music continues] He's not a stupid man, Solange. No...I didn't mean that. [music continues] - Did you get your cigars? - Yup, I got my cigars. Alright, Swanson, hup, hup! - Hey, you feeling pretty good. - I'll tell what we're gonna do. We're gonna go hit a couple of bars. Solange and I are going to the movie-- Wait a minute. Wait a minute. You can't leave me alone. Veteran of the wars. That wouldn't be nice, would it? [dog barking] No. Now, after you.

[jazz music] 'Do you always carry a gun, sergeant?' [chuckling] No, not always. Only when I'm with strangers. [music continues] - You okay? - Fine. Do you know that Mr. Callan carries a gun? What do you need that for? I don't need it. - You want it? - Hell, no, I don't want it. What about you, young lady? No, I'd like to go. Yeah, I think we better get out of here.

Hey, sarge.. ...take it easy, huh? Yeah, I guess you're right. Alright, let's get out of here. Come on! Come on. [tires screeching] I guess you had a good time. - Oh, listen, Solange-- - Oh, Tom. I don't truly accept that man. Accept him? Look, he's my first sergeant. Well.. ...goodnight, Tom. Solange. [ship horn blaring] Last ship? Yeah, you did. Yeah. I don't know what to say, Swany, I.. Been in the service 26 years. That's all I know. Army. [Callan] In the service when I was 16. wasn't like you, uh.. Maybe you think you got the world by the ass because you're...tall and...good-looking. Well, maybe you think that-that.. ...I don't think you do, maybe not. Wouldn't like you if you did. Sixteen years of age, nobody gave me any crap not even then. I did my job... ...they did theirs. I got ahead. I was the youngest sergeant in the regiment. Later...during the war.. ...I was a hero. [chuckles] I got the distinguished service cross.. ...right here in France. Near Tours. [bell ringing] When I was young.. ...the officers seemed to like me. See me passing battalion headquarters and...one of them would invite me over and introduce me to the rest and say, "This is, uh, Private Callan. He's a good soldier." Good soldier. We'd stand there talking and.. ...maybe one would have his hand on my shoulder. [sighs] - I'll be damned. - What? No, nothing. Nothing, uh.. ...I just realized I talk myself sober. [blowing nose] [instrumental music] I like you, Swanson. [music continues] What's the matter? Isn't my talk good enough for you? Yeah. Sure it is. Sure it is. Come on. Let's go. [honking] [tires screeching] [instrumental music] [Callan] 'Swanson.' I meant that when I said I liked you. I'll see you in the morning, huh. [gunshots] [gunshots continue] [laughing] Come on. Put your heel down. Alright, let's go. Get this up there, get the cheek down. Don't be afraid. 'Watch the thumb. Alright, now.' Relax. Take a deep breath and then...squeeze it off slow. Go ahead. [gunshots] Watch this. [gunshots continue] [laughing] 'How about that, huh?' [laughing continues] [crowd cheering] Atta boy! [cheering continues] [indistinct chattering] Go on, go on, go on, hit him. [whistling] Yes. Go, go, go, go. [whistle blows] [speaking in foreign language] [crowd cheering] Well done. Go collect it. [speaking in foreign language] [man announcing on PA] I believe in the survival of the fittest. If you're fit then you know you fit up there. If you're fit and you know you're fit you gotta stick with your own kind don't fool around with the weak ones. You gotta keep moving all the time. Just moving. Alright, let's have two cognac. I'll tell you something else. If you have a friend, he's gotta be moving too he's gotta be with you, and he's gotta be in the right direction. Right? Right. Got a light? I understand you got yourself a new drinking partner? - Is that what you understand? - That's right. [Callan] You know, I can't stand weakness. You take a guy like Loring. 'Take a look at him, take a look at you, huh.' You're twice what he is already. Even at your age. You have guts, you have brains, that's a winning combination. [chuckles] What's he got? Weakness. Always got some weakness. [upbeat music] You wanna get yourself an education. [Swanson] 'What do you mean?' When you get out of the army, you go to college. [Swanson] You're always calling the college guys in this company a bunch of punks. Yeah, well.. ...maybe I'm jealous. Come on. [music continues] [Pop] 'Tom?' Hiya, Pop. Been out with a man? Want a drink? No, thanks, Pop. You think badly of old Pop, don't you? You think he's a drunk, old bastard. No, Pop. We're friends. You know, Tom, I've been 19 years in this man's army. 19 long years. I figured always I'd do 20 and retire. Just have a hundred, hundred and twenty five a month do something nice and quiet. Just do what I want. Always thought I'd do 20, and now it's over. It's all finished. You'll do 20, Pop. What do you mean? The man's gonna get me. You're talking crazy, Pop. Nobody's gonna get you. Yeah, that one will. That one's after me. Look, Pop.. ...I know the man. He's tough, sure. But he's honest too ...and fair. He's not gonna get anybody. [instrumental music] [no audio] [music continues] Why don't you get out there? - You mean dance? - Yeah, why not? [laughs] Young man, I never danced in my life. - No? - Never, I dance like a knog. Can we have another two beers? [music continues] You ever been married, sergeant? Yeah, I was, uh.. Yeah, I was married. I was married. Still am married as far as I know unless she divorced me somewhere along the line. Her name was Betty and I met her in, uh, Providence, Rhode Island. It was my first 30-day leave after the war. I was at a little bar was sitting there drinking drinking, drinking three or four days, by the time I turned around there she was sitting next to me on the stool. Maybe, I was buying her drinks. Her name was Betty. [chuckles] Never was so drunk in my life. We sat there, and we drank and drank and drank and then, uh, one afternoon we just...got up walked out...got married. I never figured that out. Just got up and walked out, got married. And then we came back. Gave us the run of the bar for three or four days absolutely...free. Hmm. [laughs] She...she had a cabin in the back of her mother's place and we, uh, we went in there for 30 days and we didn't come out for 30 days. [both laughing] I tell you, we had some time. So, whatever happened to her? Huh? I said, whatever happened to her? As far as I know she's still in the cabin. [laughing] [clapping] Been all over the world, the one thing I learned.. [speaking in French] One thing I've learned.. ...never get involved. Now, pay attention. - Hey! - Hey. Put your hands up with me, champ. Watch it, come on. You're gonna get in trouble, watch it, baby, come on. That's just to, uh, teach you a little lesson. Never trust anybody. Okay. Don't look so mad, I didn't mean to hit you so hard. Come on, come on, let's forget it, okay? Come on, have a drink. What do you say? Can we have a toast? Cheers to us? Two...dirty warriors. [laughing] [honking] [laughing] [laughing continues] [clatters] [door opens] Coffee? Are you going to speak to me? Was I wrong in coming? No. No. Tom, where have you been? I don't know where I've been. Drunk, crazy. I don't know. [door opens] There are men working outside, Swanson. This is an army base. - I'll be in to see you tonight. - Uh-uh. What do you mean? I mean that, uh you're restricted. Restricted? The policy is to allow overnight passes. I make the policies. Yeah. You really do, don't you? Take it easy. I better go. You can phone me. Good idea, you should get the girl outta here. You wait a minute. What do you mean, wait a minute? This is an army base, I said get the girl outta here. Yes, come on, Tom. Come on. You wanna get laid, why don't you get a whore from the meadow? What are you gonna do? You gonna hit me? [grunts] I'm gonna put you away, Swanson. - No, sergeant, please-- - Shut up! I can put you in jail. It's all my fault. I shouldn't have been here. I thought you and Tom were friends. You wouldn't know anything about that. Perhaps I would. [dramatic music] [music continues] Don't you think you better go back? Why? Listen.. ...I don't want him to hurt you. Look, Solange, I wanna be with you, okay? Okay. - You got any food in the house? - Of course, yes. I'm Madame Gerard. How do you do? And this, of course, is my husband, Dr. Gerard. Sit down, both of you. You make me nervous, standing like that. Do you like good wine, young man? Oh, yes. This is an excellent wine. An excellent Bordeaux...'47. [Dr. Gerard] 'We must eat now.' Any time, any second, I may be called away on a matter of great urgency. Finger without a finger nail, a nose that bleeds. Uh, life is severe. And you, young man? How do you find the life of a soldier? Severe. [laughing] Eat, drink. [soft music] I love you. [vehicle approaching] What is it? Nothing. [typewriter keys clicking] Swanson.. ...you have a drink with me? No. I saw you in town last night. Yeah. Yeah, I saw your car outside Solange's house. - You did, did you? - Yeah, I did. I think you better leave me be, sergeant. Leave you be? [soft music] Stop it. Stop what? Stop watching me. Watch me. You have to be getting back? Soon. I have girlfriend in Morton. I could say I was staying with her. [music continues] Hello. Hello. [birds cawing] [engine revving] Callan? Yeah, he caught him drunk on guard duty. He says he's got him on a dozen other charges too. Hey man, there's nothing you can do. Take it easy, son. Take it easy. The law is the law. There'll be a general court-martial. And, uh...I'll see to it that he's run out of the army as being unfit. - Six months to go, huh? - That's right. Tell you how you can start the morning you can start by typing up the court-martial papers. But you be very careful because no mistakes are allowed. You just had to do it, didn't you? [chuckles] I've been thinking about you. I think this clerk job carries far too many liberties with it. So, from now on, you'll stand inspection formations 'and night guard duty.' [laughs] You don't like that, do you? That's a shame. It's a shame you're not running the company. But you're not. I am. Me. You understand that? Okay, you can go now. Oh, one more thing. Don't hang around me anymore. [cork pops] [engine revving] [intense music] [birds chirping] What did the old man get? Three months of hard labor and bad conduct discharge. Yeah, Cowley says the old man's unfit for association with soldiers in the US army. [indistinct chattering] Hey, Swany. How you doing? Hey, Komski, let me try one of those, will ya? Take your eyes off her, Swany. She belongs to me. Murph. Ask the girl what she'll have. Give her a drink. You want a beer? [speaking in French] [Callan laughing] Murphy's so dumb, he doesn't know she's a Polack. She doesn't understand French. [crowd laughing] She doesn't understand anything in French. She's Polish. The only thing she understands after that is me. Isn't that right, honey? You understand me, don't you? Yes, you do. Murphy, give me a beer. You haven't finished yours, son. That's right. You finish it. Wait a minute. What are you trying to do to me? Boy.. ...please. [indistinct chattering] Swanson! Am I understood? Are you gonna.. You're gonna shape up! Or I'll put each and every one of you in the guard house. You hear me? [Callan] 'I want this place clean. I wanna be able to eat off it.' 'I wanna be proud of it.' 'I want you to do your work like men' 'or by God, nobody goes into town..' Now.. I want a police call here. If you have to get down on all fours to do it. I want this area cleared! Cleared! Cleared! Now, pay attention! Turn left, hut, hut. Fall out. Alright, come on, quick. Pick it up, pick it up. I want every piece of paper. Do you hear me? Every butt. Every rubber! Come on, pick 'em up. Come on, come on. Let's get it. Let's get it. Let's go. Move it! Move it! Move it! Move it! [birds chirping] - Why did you stop? - I'll get a ride in from here. - You want a sandwich? - No. You're always hungry. - See you tomorrow, huh? - Yes. Goodbye. [dog barking] [speaking in foreign language] [door opens] [intense music] You've been following me. That's right. I've been following you. What of it? What of it? I'd follow you again too. You understand? Oh, God, Swany, I need you. 'I need you.' You're everything that counts. - You're mine. - No, you're wrong. I'm not wrong. I've been through hell, Swany and I'm not gonna go through it again. - You're mine. - No, you're wrong. Now, you listen to me. Now, I'm leaving. 'And I'm asking you, please, sergeant' 'just leave me alone.' Don't follow me. And don't come around me. [intense music] Swanson! Come on, Swanson, I need you. - Get away! - No, no, please. Get off, get away from me! [Swanson] 'Get away!' Get off! Get off! [Tom grunting] No, God! [Tom grunting] I didn't, I didn't do that, Swany. 'I didn't..' [intense music] You call yourselves soldiers? [laughs] A good soldier wouldn't spit on a best man in the outfit. I wouldn't soldier... with any of you. Do you hear me? You listening to me? Sergeant Callan. Dismiss the men, and report to the orderly room. I, uh, haven't reported any of this yet. I can still overlook all this. [laughs] You, you can what? Sergeant Callan I'm relieving you of your duties as First Sergeant. No. My name is Master Sergeant Albert Callan! And no one... has ever relieved me.. ...of my duties in my life. And if someone should relieve me.. ...it would not be someone like you! Look at you! If you're gonna come here and talk to me in front of my men then by God, sir have the decency to come out like an officer and a soldier! Straighten your shoulders! Walk like a man! Straighten up! [intense music] [music continues] [music continues] Company dismissed. [wind howling] [birds cawing] [door opens] [intense music] [music continues] [music intensifies] [music continues] [music continues] [melancholic music] [gun cocks] [gunshot] [birds cawing] [melancholic music] [music continues]
