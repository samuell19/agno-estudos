I will talk about it in my journal! yes! hold on I thought you were toasting! I swear I didn't understand come and sit down you don't believe me? in French: gentlemen! Plato said that: in Russian: man is an animal that is to say "man is an animal" Məşədi İbad: you are the animal! the famous scholar Darwin, has proven to the world that man descends from monkey to accept Darwin's words it is not worth going to Africa here we have a very nice specimen: Məşədi İbad I'm not trying to hurt Məşədi İbad with my words... I also look like a monkey but not to this point Məşədi İbad on the other hand resembles an orangutan leave me! you idiot, I'm on the verge of banging you! in French: if I may why would Məşədi İbad please Rüstəm Bəy? why would he give him the hand of miss Gülnaz? his beauty? no I've just told you that he is ugly his youth? no Məşədi İbad is old! but then what? maybe, his money? his possessions? his wealth? no no Rüstəm Bəy is not greedy so what is it? look, we drink wine Məşədi İbad, drinks tea so what is Məşədi İbad? Məşədi İbad in French: is a true Muslim, isn't it? that is to say: Məşədi İbad is a true Muslim I think that's why Rüstəm Bəy is giving him the hand of his daughter! cheers Rüstəm Bəy! enough talking it's time to leave, goodbye! thank you slowly in French: Məşədi İbad, farewell! go to hell! you idiot you call me a monkey and you want to shake my hand? donkey progeny! your father is the donkey I'll show you Rza Bəy still hasn't recovered from this caricature take a look it is well done! it's senseful Hüseyn, look at the gestures of the great Rüstəm! ah, come in, come in! nice to see you Sərvər! come in boys, come in my friend how are you doing? it's bad Mirzə, Rüstəm Bəy gives his daughter's hand to an old trader so when is the wedding? he met her yesterday and so? they got engaged? they promised the girl but they hit her father well too! so they got engaged? Mirzə we have a great plan it is a great idea indeed! did you hear Mirzə? he gives his young daughter's hand to an old trader it's a shame that this world goes into a spin! it's like in your collection: Xan dostu, amandı!
