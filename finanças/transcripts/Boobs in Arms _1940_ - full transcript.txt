[♪] Greeting cards, folks. MOE: Greeting cards. CURLY: Greeting cards. Greeting cards. MOE: Here we are, for all occasions. Cards for all occasions. How about a card, mister? Pardon me, stranger. Could we interest you in a nice greeting card? We write 'em ourselves. Maybe your mother has a birthday. Here's just the thing: our 77-B. Ooh. Oh! A snob, eh? [ALL CHATTERING] Oh, greetings and salutations. Greeting cards? Maybe your father has a birthday. Here's just the thing: our H-2-0. [SIGHS] Oh, a snobess? [BARKS] Ooh. Ooh. ALL: Ah-ah-ah-ah. Whoa. We're sorry, mister. It was unavoidable. Why don't you look where you're goin'? You think you own the sidewalk? Well, we said we're sorry. Yeah? Yeah. Well, if you wanna make somethin' out of it, why, go ahead. Ooh. Oh. If I thought you meant that... I'd like to see you do that once more. Ooh. For Pete's sake, take his word for it. He means it. Ow. [GRUNTS] [FEET THUDDING] [WHISTLES] Whoo-whoo-whoo. [GRUNTS] [YELLS] MAN: Wait till I get out of here! I'll fix you if it's the last thing I ever do. Nyuck, nyuck. Read him number 22. "Greetings, little shut-in. Don't you weep or sigh. "If you're not out by Christmas, you'll be out the Fourth of July." Nyuck, nyuck, nyuck. [LARRY LAUGHS] We have to do some business. We better sell some cards in this apartment house. There ain't enough weddings and funerals. I'll try in here. May have some luck. Who can tell? [CHUCKLES] Say-- Say-- Say-- Say, what is going on here? Ah. Ah. [HUFFS] You picked a fine way to sell cards: Hittin' people in the face. Stand aside. I'll show you how to sell cards. [KNOCKING TO "SHAVE AND A HAIRCUT"] [KNOCKS LAST TWO BEATS] How do you do, lady? We're selling cards for all occasions. Maybe you'd like one for your sweetheart. Or your husband. Husband? [SOBBING] What's wrong, lady? Come in and sit down. What happened? I didn't do nothin'. Sit right down over there. [SOBS] There we are. Now, what's the weeps all about? I'm afraid my husband doesn't love me anymore. Is that all? I thought it was serious. That's easily fixed. Certainly. All you have to do is get somebody to make love to you and make your husband jealous. Do you think it would work? Think? Why, certainly. He'll be so jealous, he'll take you right in his arms and kiss you. Hmm. A pleasure. Nyuck, nyuck, nyuck. Now, listen. I want you to watch your p's and q's, you hear? [BRAKES SCREECH] It's my husband. Will you gentlemen help me? I'll see that you're rewarded handsomely. Will we? Make way for the original Romeo. Nyuck, nyuck, nyuck. Spread out. [FABRIC RIPS] [GRUNTS] [FABRIC RIPS] [CRIES] Everything happens to me. Oh, gentlemen, gentlemen, which one of you will be my sweetheart? I will. I will. I will. Come here, you.

Oh! Oo-ho. Whoo. [KEYS RATTLE] Hey. Shh. Here comes somebody. Quick. Get busy. CURLY: Nyuck, nyuck, nyuck. MOE: Oh, darling, leave your husband and fly away with us. You know you love us, not that picklepuss husband of yours. Nyuck, nyuck, nyuck. What's goin' on in here? Scram, buddy. You're interferin' with romance. Go. Ah-ah! Ah-ah! Why, you-- Ah.

[GROANS] [PANTING] [WHEEZING] [TEETH CHATTER] [GASPS] [TEETH CHATTER] [GASPS] We'll hide in this bread line. He'll never find us here. That's good. I've been runnin' so much, I've worked up an appetite. Boy, this reminds me of card number 24: "You're in the army now. You'll always have your chow. You'll never get rich"-- I know. I know, but we don't need any money in the army. Mmm. Oh, boy. A bench. [CURLY CHUCKLES] What a life. Nothin' to do but live off the fat of the land. And eat and sleep. MAN: That's what you think. That's what I said. What about it? I didn't say anything. MAN: But I did. ALL: Ah-ah-ha. Well, well, well. So we meet again. Attention! Right shoulder arms! About face! [METAL CLANGS] Oh. [METAL CLANGS] Attention! Present arms! You dumbbells. Oh. Oh. A duck. Look at mine. I missed. Oh. A duck for my tapeworm. [LAUGHS] Drop those ducks and fall in that line! Hey! Don't go away. Nyuck, nyuck, nyuck. SERGEANT: Now, get this: I'm gonna make soldiers out of you guys if I have to kill you. And I hope I do. And that goes for you too. Attention! Right shoulder arms! Right face! By twos, forward, march! Nyuck, nyuck, nyuck. Hey, don't look now, but I think we're goin' the wrong way. SERGEANT: To the rear, march! Company, halt! What do you guys think you're doin'? Playin' hippety-hop at the barbershop? Now, snap into it and march like soldiers. And that goes for you too. About face! I won't do it. He don't pay my salary. It's a guy with a beard. Why would--? Ah! About face. Forward march! GROUP: Oh. Company, attention! Fall in on that line. Fall in! Now, listen: One more break out of you guys, and I'm gonna hang you. All three of you. Now, I'm gonna teach you how to be soldiers whether you like it or not. Right shoulder arms! Left shoulder arms! Right shoulder arms! Port arms! Inspection arms! Port arms! Inspection arms! Right shoulder arms! Arms! Arms! Arms! Arms! Arms! Arms! Arms! Arms! Left shoulder arms! What do you think you're doin'? I'm gonna show you how to do the manual of arms. Port arms. Present arms.

Ah. Mm. Company halt! Now we're going to have a little bayonet practice, men. Ah. Nyuh. Now, you always want to get them right between the eyes. High. Just about here. [CARTILAGE CRUNCHES] [GROANING] See, men? Right about there. [FIST SMACKS] [GRUNTS] Heh. Now, then, plant your feet firmly, hold the gun steady, and lunge hard, right between the eyes. But sometimes the enemy doesn't give you a chance to use your bayonet. So then you club 'em. If they haven't surrendered by then, you kick 'em. And then you sock 'em. But the thing to remember is the bayonet's your real weapon. On this bag, I'll show you how to really do away with the enemy. You lunge high, right between the eyes. Ah-ah-ah. You lunge high again, right in the nose. Oh. [PANTING] [MUTTERING] Uh... [TEETH CHATTER] But the main thing to remember is you get them. Don't let them get you. Now, then, you grab the gun firmly, both wrists rigid, your left forearm parallel with the ground. Then you pivot with your right foot, and you throw everything you have into it. [SOLDIERS LAUGHING] Silence! [LAUGHTER STOPS] Give me that hose. [SERGEANT LAUGHS] [GAGS] Why, you. [LAUGHS] [GRUMBLES] [SPITS] [CRIES] Everything happens to me.
