This story is based on a true event... Grandma, are you alright? Don't worry. Where you going? Leaving town with everything? I think | loaned you money... Forgive me! 10 YEARS LATER, 1766 Is your town really that poor? Not at all, there's nothing to worry about! Tokuheiji SUGAWARAYA Tea Grower Tokuheiji SUGAWARAYA Tea Grower Poor people can just flee if they want. Tokuheiji SUGAWARAYA Tea Grower Tokuheiji SUGAWARAYA Tea Grower But we can grow tea, and sell it. But we can grow tea, and sell it. I received Master Tea Grower rank from the Senior Regent. You won't suffer hardship. Look! 'Kimo-iri' is coming to meet us! 'Kimo—iri'? Means 'Village Chief', an official. lkuemon ENDO Village Chief Means 'Village Chief', an official. lkuemon ENDO Village Chief Comingjust to meet you? In Yoshioka, I, Tokuheiji Sugawaraya, have earned a good reputation, and I'm considered to be a wise leader here. Chief! I sold my tea in Kyoto, even brought back a bride! Your horse! Huh?! Another one fled! Under the order, we must provide at least 8 horses! Get off now! Excuse me! What's going on?! Hurry! What in the world...?! THE MAGNIFICENT NINE Sendai Domain, Kurokawa District, Yoshioka Town, 24km north of Sendai castle on Oshu Road. Uptown, Midtown, and Lowtown combine to form this small post-town. Although a post-town, most residents are farmers. But since Yoshioka has little farmland, half of them make their incomes by trading. But even trade is limited, nearby villages can send goods directly to Sendai. Also, for solve reason traveling merchants use other roads, so conditions are very bad. To make matters worse, the town suffered under 'post—horse duty'. A duty to transport goods along the road for their Lord, from the previous post-town to the next post-town. Unbelievably, cost wasn't borne by their Lord, but by the residents themselves. Poor farmers had to buy horses, and hire laborers. So many went bankrupt, or fled the town at night. FOR SALE 80 many went bankrupt, or fled the town at night. So many went bankrupt, or fled the town at night. Established 150 years earlier, the post-town of 200 householdes declined yearly. The few remaining were left with an even greater burden. As a result, households declined even more. Yoshioka Town was trapped in this terrible dilemma. Careful with the horse. Juzaburo KOKUDAYA Sake Brewer It really is terrible. Sugawaraya? When did you get back? Just now. They took my horse right away. Pitiful beast... In this town, it's always the same. Always the same... It really is. Nothing changes. Head for Tomiya before sunset, hurry! Dennosuke YASHIMA District Governor Head for Tomiya before sunset, hurry! Dennosuke YASHIMA District Governor Dennosuke YASHIMA District Governor By the way, Kokudaya, By the way, Kokudaya, I brought back a wife. Kyoto sweet shop daughter. Impressively, she wants to grow tea north of here! I'm moved by her passion... To Our Lord Kokudaya... What is that for? A petition?! Otherwise nothing will change! You can't! They'll behead you! I've decided! What are you doing, Kokudaya?! Kokudaya, wait! What are you doing?! Kokudaya! What?! What's going on? Hey, what's that? Saw it already! What are you |ousy...?! What is it? What's the problem? What is it, Kokudaya? A petition...! No, it isn't! I am Sugawaraya, just back from Kyoto. Astoundingly, Senior Regent Kujo... granted a name for my tea! What? Show it to me! Permission to use the name Spring Breeze! Impressive! You deserve it, Sugawaraya. You're remarkable, especially for a farmer. |'|| inform our Lord! I'm very grateful! I'm leaving. Kokudaya, you want to die? It's all the same. Even if I live now, all of us farmers will be... worked to the bone, then discarded. More crazy talk... In any case, it's true. Especially a man of your wisdom must know that. Well, I guess you're right. What should we do?! That's it! Sugawaraya, a man like you must have a great idea! What should we do?! - Well, we should... - Yes?! Each and every household should give it their all. Give our all! - To what?! - To what...? Let's see... To trading. What's wrong? Nothing... Your great idea? Now I know... about your limits. Hang on, don't say '|imits'...! Jinnai ASANOYA Sake Brewer, Pawnshop Jinnai ASANOYA Sake Brewer, Pawnshop I heard that you'd returned. I heard that you'd returned. For now... Just the interest owed. Is there no other way? Want more tea fields, but tough to pay even interest... I heard you were granted an Imperial tea name? Our tea is too distant to be respected in Edo. |t'|| add prestige to our tea, esteem for our Lord Date... Your business will prosper. I hope so. I look forward to it. Your wisdom will help you repay interest more easily. - Put it on my tab. - Alright! 40 'mon' owed by... Welcome! Madame Lord, sake please. Sugawaraya, welcome back! Heard your wife is very young?! Gossip spreads in this little town... Is there no other way? To do what? About your younger brother. Paid him half my Kyoto income today. I don't want to hear about him. I know. Brothers, but totally different. One challenges our Lord, the other is a miser. Everyone just thinks about themselves. Idon't think like that. My tea will become known as a local specialty of this post-town. Local specialty...? Lack of a specialty dooms a post-town. Thought so much of us?! Of course. I wanted to say so. I didn't ignore it. Here it is. However, I want to grow new tea plants, and double my fields. But can't, with such high interest, Kokudaya. Rather than... your direct petition, have your brother give us his hoard of coins... What's wrong? Is it too salty?! It is the interest. I apologize for him, just like our father... Don't mean that. However... What is it? Well, I've actually been thinking about this, what if we... lend money... to Lord? - I don't need it. - Not Madame Lord! I am referring to Lord Date. - In other words... - Yes?! Lend money to our Lord, and collect interest. Then use that interest to buy post-horses. If we do that, everyone's burden is gone, and it'll revive their trade. Will our Lord accept money from his own farmers?! Haven't our duties been hard lately? I heard our Lord's cutting trees everywhere. He is selling them. Don't know why, but in any case he needs money. Our Lord is... desperate for money. How much would we lend? How much?! Let me see, roughly... About 1,000 ryo. 1,000 ryo? Interest about 10% per year. Lend or Lord 1,000 ryo, earn 100 ryo interest annually. With 100 ryo, post-horse costs will be covered. It's difficult to calculate Edo currency in present values, but for example, if a flask of sake is used as a standard... 1 FLASK OF SAKE = 4 'MON' = 240 YEN 1,000 RYO = 300 MILLION YEN Where is so much money in this post-town? Good point, that's the problem! We don't have the money. Sorry to get carried away. Just an empty dream. Blame the sake, and forgive me. Ahh, fell for your words! Madame Lord, can I put it on my tab? FOLLOWING YEAR, 1767 Sir! Kokudaya is down below! Kokudaya?! Alright, I'll go down! Recently he doesn't go to the public bath he loves, takes cold ritual baths daily. He fasts, and paces to pray at the shrine. Praying for a wish to come true? Why'd you bother to come so far?! Sugawaraya, you're a brilliant man! Jubei KOKUDAYA Miso Paste Maker Well... Why are you here? I took a chance, and told my uncle, and he's absolutely with us! With us? About what? About what?! The 1,000 ryo! To lend to our Lord! I knew that you think differently. The pride of Yoshioka! Come on, let's take a walk... I told you it was an empty dream! Please look at this. 1,000 ryo gold is 5,000 kan in coins! Back then, only samurai or rich merchants used gold coins. Commoners rarely saw them. Of course, in a town as poor as Yoshioka, it was mainly 60-yen copper coins in circulation. Collecting that would be very hard for two of us. No, I can't... But if there are 10 people like my uncle, each one only needs 500 kan! 500 KAN = 30 MILLION YEN It's not impossible. It isn't a get-rich-quick—scheme, no matter what, we earn nothing. I understand that. You do, but what about others? Interest would be used entirely for post-horses. Is that true? Not for ourselves, but for the town. You taught me that. And if this scheme is leaked, we may be beheaded. By lending money to our Lord, we're taking money from him. Beheaded? I am ready to die! There are others that think like my uncle. Sugawaraya, this is not an empty dream! Understood. In that case, we will... tell the Chief now. Tell the Chief?! Chief represents townsfolk officially, informing them of the Lord's notices, collecting on post-horse duty, taxes, etc., subcontracting the Lord's business, in other words... He is our Lord's pawn! Even if we do tell him now... But can we skip him, and inform our Lord? You're right. Important matters are discussed with the Chief, and permission received. Right. Let's keep everything official. - What's this? - Horse. That's right! Such a smart boy. Tokichi is my first son, I didn't imagine a child could be so sweet. Eventually he'll follow in my footsteps, and be Village Chief. However, the post-horse burden just increases year by year. What do you think of post-horse duty? It is unreasonable. "Unreasonable"?! Notjust unreasonable! Why are commoners like us... forced to suffer by samurai?! Chief, they'll hear you. Tokichi, come here. Even worse, post-horse failures... are all blamed on the Chief. Thatjail in Sendai! Winter in Mutsu is severed. Thrown into the drafty jail with just one thin kimono... If Tokichi was... I'm sure he would... freeze to death! We can't do anything?! We can do something. Is it really possible to do such a thing? It would be difficult. To begin, we need 1,000 ryo... I firmly believe in it. I'd do anything for him. I can earn money working! If even selling everything is not enough, I'll put out my bowl and be a beggar. After all, it's not just for Tokichi, but for all Yoshioka kids! Truly, it must be as you say! It was worth it... Next step is the Grand Chief. We can't bypass Grand Chief, and go to our Lord. The Village Chief represents the townspeople, above that is Grand Chief, representing about 40 villages. Chunai CHISAKA Grand Chief representing about 40 villages. Chunai CHISAKA Grand Chief Chunai CHISAKA Grand Chief To commoners, the official closest to the Lord. To commoners, the official closest to the Lord. We should give up on this. Chisaka wants to be a samurai. If he tells our Lord directly, we'll get beheaded! In that case, we must convince him! In Sendai, even when it rained, commoners could use only oil-paper or straw rain capes, but at the rank of Grand Chief, an umbrella was permitted. One key role of the Grand Chief was... exposing criminal activity. Offering money to our Lord, to increase your rank. No, that is not our plan...! I truly believed... you came to consult about that. Recently, citizens... think only of... getting profit for themselves. However... However, you are not like that! Basically, I have to consider this as Grand Chief. From this evening, I beg you to... regard me as one of you! Thank you. SENDAI CASTLE, OUTER CITADEL In this year, the Lord of the Sendai Domain Shigemura Date, was 25 years of age. Junior 4th Upper Court Rank, Lieutenant General of Imperial Guards He absolutely wanted promotion to that rank. But that rank changes nothing. It was purely due to rivalry with Lord Satsuma, who held similar rank. Gift to the Council of Elders of the Shogun in Edo, 50,000 ryo. For approval of construction, 200,000 ryo. There is simply not enough money to pay that. Hey, Kaya ba, what should we do? Moku KAYABA Financial Deputy Moku KAYABA Financial Deputy The Financial Deputy managed finances for the domain, The Financial Deputy managed finances for the domain, but on occasion exercised more authority than superiors. Are you listening? He held tremendous power. All such matters... should be left to me, Moku Kayaba. Buy up all rice. Almost none remains, commoners will have nothing to eat! They have barley, millet, and radishes. They won't die. Predecessors borrowed money from merchants... Never! Listen... Being rich or poor is determined byjust one thing. Whether you earn interest, or whether you pay interest. Being in debt is totally unacceptable! If there is no rice, produce coins instead. FOLLOWING YEAR, 1768 Our Lord has started to produce coins. Coins?! I knew it! Our Lord needs money! Sugawaraya, exactly as you said! Perfect timing. Let's hurry! Unfortunately, we still don't have 10 members. Tough to raise 1,000 ryo with only us... Don't be so easygoing! After our Lord has coins in circulation, he won't need a loan! Pay one kan for one set of furniture... In other words, you won't use our present savings to expand the tea fields? Let's give up selling fields and things! You're wonderful. My father always says 50. Give for the benefit of all. I am so... proud to support you as my husband. - This also. - Natsu! You can't sell that! In times like this, we must sell our finest treasures. It was your idea, you have to set an example. It's magnificent. Father, I haven't agreed to this yet. Even our mementos? What would Mother say, if she were still alive...? She was also from this town, so won't complain. But imagine how we feel, and Kayo won't be able to marry. Don't worry about me. Basically, why have a business to just... give all our money away? Shameful. Shameful my own son says that. You're just like my father, and my younger brother. | feel the same. I'd rather be born an Asanoya. What?! Wasn't this from the Senior Regent?! In such times, even treasures. It was my idea, so I have to set an example. Take it away! Junai ENDO Money Exchange Shop Chief! More people are fleeing town! What?! Who? Kokudaya and Sugawaraya. Household goods on carts this morning. Oh... that's all? Alright, got it. I'll check on them later. What?! Lend money to our Lord?! Right. I don't know exactly, but that's what I heard. Not nearly enough money... We knew it would be tough with just five... Grand Chief has come? Isn't it wrong to secretly discuss such matters, and even have the Chief involved? What are you talking about? Lending money to the Lord. That's what I mean. Who told you? I'm a money-changer. By nature, I have an instinct about money. Our Lord has started producing coins. To produce coins, he has to buy copper. A furnace, firewood, and laborers are required. Massive amounts of money are needed. Clearly the best way to make money... is to lend money to someone making money. I want in on the investment. How much is it? No, Junai, you misunderstand... It's 500 kan for one share. In that case, I'll take two shares! It's settled. 1,000 kan! Hey, hey, is that really alright? Thinks it's to get-rich-quick. I didn't lie. We're still lending money to our Lord. True. It's for the benefit of this post-town. If we explain sincerely, I'm sure he'll eventually agree. Besides, with Junai involved... TOTAL: 3,500 KAN = 210 MILLION YEN Our goal is in sight. If the scheme is leaked, we'll deal with it at that time... FOOD & SAKE FOLLOWING YEAR, 1769 That's the plan! That is the plan! So, no profit or compensation? Nothing. It's enough to make you cry. Kokudaya, and Sugawaraya. And Jubei and the Chief. Hang on, they're all men from Midtown! True, all Midtown. Midtown's the best. Gentlemen from our Midtown are great! Right, that's why Midtown is so good. If this continues, our Lowtown will pay nothing! In the future, we'll hang our heads in shame. Shinshiro HAYASAKAYA Cereals Shop In the future, we'll hang our heads in shame. Shinshiro HAYASAKAYA Cereals Shop Perhaps you're right... I'm sure of it. I'd like to contribute money, but a guy like me can't afford it. But you, Hayasakaya, are different. In an case, your big shop in Lowtown should contribute. Perhaps you're right... I'm sure of it. Your name will live on for eternity. Perhaps you're... I'm sure of it! "Dead tiger leaves its skin, dead man leaves his name." How much should I contribute? Hayasakaya will pay?! Heihachi, you're amazing. Maybe we can do something? Want to, but have no money... What happened with Uptown? I wonder... Maybe men like Asanoya? No way, misers since the Father. Haven't donated to the temple even once. Brews sake and lends money, after lending money, charges inflated interest rates. Remember Chubei, who fled at night over a decade ago? Yeah, carpenter. While fleeing, stopped in his tracks by a shout. Know what was said? Yelled "Pay back the loan!" Terrible. No blood or tears in him! Kokudaya is an excellent man. Yeah, but the father and son are totally different. Uptown is no good. Our Midtown has to do something. That's right. Midtown and Lowtown have to deal with it. No, hang on. What are you saying? What is it? What's wrong? What is it? What...?! What's wrong? What...? What were you saying? Why are you crying?! Surprised me! This endeavor will support your descendants for eternity. You are lucky to have this opportunity. General Akechi got a bad reputation by killing his Lord Oda, but Kyoto was exempt from taxes in his lifetime... Even now, in Kyoto, Akechi is a man who is greatly respected. Consider use of money for the benefit of this town... If this continues, Yoshioka has no tomorrow! Think of nothing but posterity, let yourself be one of them! The story has leaked. Rumor has spread throughout the town! What's going on?! If we explain sincerely, he'll eventually agree...? Yes, he definitely will. Well then, do your best. I don't understand! Why is all the interest used by the post-town?! That is to ease the burden on the post-horses... That is fine. But then we earn nothing. Of course, there will be no earnings. I don't understand. To save this post-town. Somehow, to this foolish merchant, that is difficult to understand. I want out of the scheme. Tell me! Who'd you recommend it to? Hayasa kaya, in Lowtown. From my fortune, I can only invest... Offered 300 kan. But he can pay more. He has lots of money saved! He's obsessed with boring a health spa tunnel. "Health spa"... is a hot spring? He recently visited Naruko spa, and is obsessed with boring a tunnel to get water. Damn! That's why he won't give more! Any others? Who else did you tell? In Uptown... I told Zenpachi. I heard they were broke. However... Here you are. Zenpachi KOKUDAYA General Store Zenpachi KOKUDAYA General Store I understand. I'll make money soon! I understand. I'll make money soon! Will you wait? Yes...? And offered 200 kan. He probably misunderstood something. About what? He's a widower, like me. He may think the money is a dowry to marry you. That's fine by me. Never! Why not? If that's how you feel, you should marry me. But I have another ambition. After that is fulfilled, will you want me? It will take many years... How many years? How many years...? I'm just joking. Oh, you were joking? Others... We went to see Watanabeya, Asamaya, and Sakuraiya, but... Of course I want to be part of it, but with limited savings such as mine... It's all just a publicity stunt. They should be ashamed. They just want to show off that they're rich. They're not like that at all. No, I understand how they feel. I know people that feel good through charity. I can't stand it anymore! Who's there?! It's Rihei. What happened? Probably rejected? Where did you go? To Asanoya. Impossible over there, he won't pay. Well, actually... He'll pay?! How much? 100 kan? 200 kan? 500. 500 mon? 500 kan. He said he'll pay 500 kan. Hey, hey, wait! He definitely said 'pay'? Sure he didn't say 'lend'? It is true. However... Asanoya, you realize there's no profit? All interest is for post-horses. I know that. I won't prosper unless the town does. So I'll invest in the town. It's the same as lending money to you. I heard that it was you, Sugawaraya, who came up with this idea? Well, I did... You're really a remarkable man. In that case, write off my debt as investment...? I guess not... My elder brother... How much will Kokudaya invest? At present, everyone is equal, investing 500 kan. In that case, |'|| invest another 500 kan. If I pay the same, in Yoshioka the name Asanoya... will become tainted, Rihei persuaded me. He is simply paying to spite me! If he joins our plan, I'll drop out of it. Why do you suddenly say that?! Juzaburo, your family seems to have a strange relationship. What happened? Isn't this the strange thing? I'm the older brother, but was sent for adoption! You do have a point.. I was 7 when I was adopted out. For me, the only memory I have is listening to Father reading difficult text. Even now I don't know if it was Confucius, and understood nothing at age 7. But my brother was different. Only 4 or 5 years old but listened intently. My father gave up on me. To preserve our family fortune, he chose my smarter brother. You don't know that for sure... My brother is like Father. He's intelligent, and good at business. He's also just as miserly and stingy. I was adopted out to a sake brewer, and worked hard to be as successful as my family. However... I can't stand it if he's offering... 1,000 kan so easily... That's a different story... It's all the same. I simply have nothing at all. Juzaburo, it seems that you... started this just to triumph over your father and brother? I will keep my investment at 500 kan. However, please remove my name. I am definitely not trying to promote my name. FOLLOWING YEAR, 1770 Master, has anyone donated more than I have? You are foremost, Junai, and have donated the most. It is rare for a man... to hide his ambitions, while caring about temple donation. I heard about it. Your donation to the Lord of our domain. I was struck right to my heart. Giving up selfish desire, showing great spiritual generosity, by accepting the suffering of the post-town as your own, causing me to weep so much, my black sleeves were soaked with tears. However, I wonder if such a scheme will really work? It's not a matter of success... or of failure. I'll leave a written record of the details, so future generations will know of it. This town will take great pride in your actions, for many generations to come. Until now, each member has contributed 500 kan. 500 KAN = 30 MILLION YEN We have a new donation, from Hayasakaya, 300 kan. 300 KAN = 18 MILLION YEN From Zenpachi Kokudaya, 200 kan. 200 KAN = 12 MILLION YEN And from Asanoya, 1,000 kan. 1,000 KAN = 60 MILLION YEN As a result, we have a total of 4,000 kan. Only 1,000 kan more is required. May | enter? I also want to contribute. I've had a change of heart. I want to accept the suffering of this post-town as my own. It's not a matter of being able to or not. In that case... 1,000 kan! Oh, we collected 1,000 ryo! No, I'll pay the same amount as others. No, I'm not refusing to pay... The Chief, and Grand Chief have paid, so I hesitate to pay more. Besides, the amount is fixed at 500 kan each. Someone did pay less, but a fixed amount is a fixed amount. It's best not to differ. Are you referring to me? I'll pay it. 500 kan is lacking? I will pay it. So, a total of 1,500 kan?! Oh, but that's... 1,500 KAN = 90 MILLION YEN Oh, but that's... 1,500 KAN = 90 MILLION YEN Asanoya, what are you up to? The Grand Chief and Chief paid 500 kan, all of us! Hold on, Junai! At 1,500 kan, you want all the glory for this deed?! What deed? Stop that, stop! Don't quarrel! All members are present at this meeting today. Everyone, we must be discreet... in our behavior. We are not paying to be honored or promote ourselves. Am I mistaken? That is correct. I have prepared this document. Please allow me to read it. "Agreed, refrain from brawls and quarrels." Generally, please forgive insults. "Agreed, refrain from revealing this matter to outsiders." Don't tell post-town residents that you invested. Why is that...? If questioned, pretend that you know nothing. Including who paid how much? Be discreet. That seems best. - Lucky for you! - What's that?! You werejust told not to quarrel! "Agreed, when making donations to shrines and temples, refrain from being named." Best to avoid our names in all things from now on. To avoid criticism. "Agreed, when walking about, refrain from discourteous behavior." 0n the roads, try to walk along the side. Do we have to be that cautious...? "Agreed, when attending public events, sit in the lowest seats not places of honor." Actually, you mean...? What's wrong? Do you mean avoid honored seats... our entire lives? Yes. For generations to come. Children? Grandchildren?! None of us will boast of paying this money, but our descendants may not agree. With this, we establish our "Code of Discretion". Those in agreement... will affix their name seal. It is said half the commoners couldn't read in this era. So for town politics, reading aloud was important. In Yoshioka, in autumn of that year, it is recorded that a petition was read aloud. "We lack horses, "but can't buy at the standard price. "Even if we can buy them, "they suffer from lack of fodder, "become emaciated, and die one after the other. "Due to enormous expenses, "commoners are... "falling deeper into poverty. "Many houses face collapse, and many people face collapse. "They're unable to fulfill public duty. "Therefore, with all due respect." Show discretion. "We beg that compassion be shown. "Full-fledged farmer households, "6 kan. "Half-fledged farmer households, 4 kan, "from the upcoming year." Must be a fire somewhere...? I'll go and check on it. "If what we have requested... "is considered as asked, "as an expression of gratitude..." No one even stands... They fear poverty more than fire. Already this year, two more households have fled. From this point onwards, Chisaka, we depend on you. Thank you. We're counting on you. Without fail I will return with good news. For this matter, see my colleague, Governor Hashimoto. The "colleague"... refers to dividing his own given authority with others. In this era, there was a surplus of samurai. The colleague, Gonemon Hashimoto, was located very far away. Gonemon HASHIMOTO District Governor This is unusual... Raise your head. In all my days, I have never heard of a petition such as this. However, without fail, |'|| consult with my Superiors! |'|| prepare a letter of reference now. Wait here. 0h... Are you in a hurry? I've never met a Grand Chief so kind to commoners. You need other clothes. |'|| lend you mine. Hey! Bring some clothes! Shichisaburo IMAIZUMI Prefectural Governor People of Yoshioka request this. What shall we do? lmaizumi Rejected. However, a windfall of 1,000 ryo is something... Taking advantage. Not worth consideration. Very sorry. Instead of that, I received some fine cloth, take some, as a souvenir for your wife. "Not worth consideration." This is the end. Doesn't even say why... Made us wait three months for this? Seems we made an impossible request to the Lord? How about circulating the 1,000 ryo amongst us, and distribute interest to the town? Chisaka, what's gotten into you? What...? If we could circulate money here, we wouldn't involve our Lord. Listen, this is also for the benefit of our Lord. Without post-towns, horses and people would be gone. Request 2 or 3 times, our Lord will... However, I have my own position. Position? What is it? FOLLOWING YEAR, 1771 50 late... Chief didn't hear anything either? Nothing at all. Can't believe we've been waiting one year. Taking so long to reply... Perhaps we made a petition beyond our status. Temple Donations Junai Endo, 5 kan Master, on the far left can't we just display a nameplate saying... "Anonymous Donor, Midtown"? Well, if we did do that, it would be a problem... for other anonymous donors. Other anonymous donors?! What are you doing? Thief...? Thief! Somebody! Somebody! Thief...? Thief! Won't get by me! Everybody, a thief! Catch him! What?! Sorry, Madame. A thief! I'm not a thief! Then what about this money?! It's you! Chubei?! Why did you come back? It must be to get revenge on Asanoya? Revenge? Why would I want revenge on Asanoya? When you were fleeing, didn't he force you to pay him back? It's true that he did stop me... Where you going? I think | loaned you money... Forgive me! Sir, we have nothing left... You don't need to return this. Forget the debt you owe. Listen... You did your best. It's not your fault that you have to leave. Social structure is to blame. Be aware of that, don't be a bitter person. He was only strict about payment... when collecting from the rich. But from poor people like us, he never once pushed for repayment. Thanks to his money, in Sendai, I really worked like crazy, and after 15 years, I wanted to return to at least pay back the capital. But when I did, he'd already died seven years earlier! Went to pay his son, all records were destroyed. Since I had no choice, I tried to sneak in, and return the money... It seems that we... were totally wrong about Asanoya. Juzaburo...?! Juzaburo! It can't be... It can't... Father... You come also! Have you been in good health? Yes, I have. Father saved coins in a ceramicjar every night. About 100 kan in each jar. There are a total of seven jars, he saved very well. He started saving around the time you were born. Father intended to pay the money to the Lord, and request reduction of the post-horse duty. If I can't do it, you do it. If you can't do it... If I couldn't do it, my child... Even if it took generations, to uphold his aspiration... to use the money for a self-sustaining post-town. I never heard anything about this! That was also his wish. Your Kokudaya family should not be involved. However, even though you weren't informed, you supported post-town relief, ruining the Kokudaya family... Parent and child really are very much alike. But, since we weren't told about that, you know the rumors that spread. Such as stingy, miserly, tight-fisted? Never allow for this matter... to be known to outsiders. Ignore any slanderous remarks that occur. This is not being done to receive praise from others. Father taught us this. It was written in the neo—Confucian book, "Myogakun". He always read it to us, from an early age. "Never seek gratitude, "do not seek reward, "do what is right to do, "man and all things under Heaven's Law..." But, I was never listening to him. You were listening! You listened carefully, while appearing to play. Isn't that the reason you're now doing what our Father did? What happened? Please come with me now. What will we do, at this late hour? Perhaps you mentioned that matter to the others? Even without talking, it'll become known. Even so, it is rude to appeal to our Lord again so soon... Which side are you on?! Having a name and sword make you into a samurai, but in the end you're a commoner like us! Using an umbrella is so admirable?! It is not you who is admirable. It is Juzaburo and the laborers, and also... Asanoya! Even just a little bit, people who try to find purity in an impure world! Asanoya, I'm sorry, but please tell that story... once again to the Grand Chief. Elder brother... thank you so much for this. What's wrong? Everything is blurry, I can barely see. What? Our father was too ashamed to send... someone like me out for adoption. You have been.... swept up in such matters. I am truly... sorry for everything. FOLLOWING YEAR, 1772 In any case, it is simply unlucky. He said only "Taking advantage", and rejected the petition. "Taking advantage"? It means the ones earning interest win. Seeing our Lord needed money, taking advantage with high interest. That's not true! I know that, too. It actually began... almost 40 or 50 years ago. There was a man named Jinnai Asanoya. One day, that man began to save coins. He scrimped every day on what he ate, the savings... were put into a ceramicjar, one coin at a time. No one knows why he started doing that. He was ridiculed as a miserly man. However, the mystery was solved as he lay on his deathbed. That man held his son's hand, and said the following. "It's my dream... "to present these savings to our Lord, "with the request that our post-town be forever saved from suffering." But it still wasn't enough money. Succeeding his father's name, the son began to save coins, one by one. Day by day, for decades... Wait a moment... Saving money of his wife, children, servants. Chisaka, wait! Is that the money... referred to in the petition, the 1,000 ryo? It was rejected by our Lord, but wasn't taking advantage... Understood! I want to confirm one point. You're notjust inventing this story for the first time now? No, a man called Jinnai... You mean that it... started decades ago, and has spanned two generations? It is remarkable. I can't give up on this. Alright, let's rewrite the petition. Deputy Kayaba! Please reconsider the Yoshioka matter. Ask the Prefectural Governor. Deputy Kayaba! Deputy Kayaba! I said that was rejected. Taking advantage. It is not that! Your interpretation is totally wrong! Really? Why is it wrong? It all started about 40 or 50 years ago! Day by day, saving coins for decades... Everything is written here! Certainly, a commendable deed. Approved. Thank you! However, just one point has to be revised. What is it? Lord doesn't accept coins. Revise "5,000 kan in coins" to "1,000 ryo in gold". Of course! Is that everything? I am so grateful! All of the post-town residents will celebrate. 50 late... Please proceed. I got it! Only one revision, Deputy Kayaba approved. The Asanoya ancestors achieved this. Asanoya isn't here...? He tricked us. "Payment in coins would present difficulties, "so an amount of 1,000 ryo in gold will be paid instead". So we have to pay in gold rather than coins? Yes, Lord doesn't take coins. No, that's no good! Why not? The standard rate was 5,000 kan for 1,000 ryo, but now Lord's minting more coins, reducing the value. You mean 5,000 kan is not enough? How much will it be? 1,000 ryo in gold is...? 5,800 kan! We need 800 kan more?! ADDITIONAL 48 MILLION YEN Forgive me, I failed to notice... I'll go back to Sendai now, and have it revoked! Please don't! This is our lifeline! Right, he won't reconsider the matter. He agreed to 1,000 ryo, but may refuse next time. You're right, Deputy Kayaba is like that. Prefectural Governor, thank you for your success. our lifeline. Deputy Kayaba, that was too unfair... "A drowning man will grasp at straws"... Before grasping, he must be pushed into the water, and drowning... I'm afraid that he'll try to take even more. What?! Making him even more of a miser. It's always been this way. Disgraceful! Regardless of that, what about the 800 kan? I've got nothing more to give. Junai, what about you? There are others who should give. Are you talking about me? I don't mean you. I'm talking about... You mean Hayasa kaya? We haven't seen him for quite a while. Madame, sake is done! Show respect for the Grand Chief! What's wrong? Some kind of trouble? Everything is fine. Hey! Out of sake, Madame. How much more is needed? 800 kan. - Don't add! - Not here for money! I can offer 500 kan more. No more! But we're almost there. We've climbed so far already, the peak is in sight... If your business is ruined, it's all for nothing. He's right. You can't pay any more. Please leave it to us. If we split what's owing, it won't be too much. Plus, by brazenly requesting the original 5,000 kan amount, we can gain time for collecting money... What's wrong? No work chant... Let me pass by. What is it?! Step aside! Juzaburo? No unrefined sake? Why no brewers? I'm not making sake this year. Why not?! Wasn't able to buy rice... Everything has been revealed... As you can see, everything has been lost. We already sacrificed, selling all our clothes and household goods, prepared to do whatever we had to do. So we are already resigned to our fate. Please let us... offer some more money. Elder brother, Sugawaraya, we beg you to... accept our offer. Understood. Well then, we humbly... accept your offer. We're greatly relieved! | just don't get it! Considering your wealth, paying only 300 kan is strange! You have money for the hot-spring tunnel. No business can prosper forever. However, if the family head falls, descendants get nothing. What?! You care more about yourself than future generations?! You shameless...! We agreed to refrain from quarrels! Restrain yourself! Let's settle down! Asanoya offered... another 500 kan to us. Can't be! But his business... He'll go bankrupt. He's already resigned to that. As a result... we still need... 300 kan. 300 KAN = 18 MILLION YEN Hey, did you hear what we said?! -I heard it! - Didn't listen! Everybody settle down! Our Lord is to blame. We're fighting because of our Lord, that's ridiculous! It's alright. Enough... I'll pay the rest. Hey, what's all this?! Collecting unpaid tabs. So much?! Been waiting 6 years! They never pay their tabs! How long to get all 1,000 ryo?! You gents have to pay up, too. Here. Thank you! Sugawaraya, 1 kan... Junai, 2 kan 400 mon. Now | see! I was impressed that you drink a lot with no money. All on tabs! Others who hesitate to pay did contribute coins... All together, 50 kan. That's it? Still not enough?! 50 KAN = 3 MILLION YEN We still need 250 kan. Hearing of Father's cherished ambition, and that only 250 kan was still needed, I borrowed it from Miuraya, in Sendai. I agreed... to become an apprentice to Miuraya, with 10 years of wages to be paid to me in advance. From now I will work, while scrimping and saving, and do my utmost to serve. Someday, I will know how to carry on the Kokudaya business. Father, please forgive my willful behavior. Thank you, Otoemon... Thank you. Kayo, it will be cold again this winter. Keep the charcoal burning, so Father won 't catch a cold, while I am away. FOLLOWING YEAR, 1773 What?! They have it? Exactly 1,000 ryo in gold, not even one ryo missing. I thought they'd have more. Asanoya faces bankruptcy, and the ruin of that family. That man is too fine to be just a commoner. Raise your heads. Kurokawa Ward Grand Chief, Chunai Chisaka. Same, Yoshioka Town Chief, lkuemon. Same, commoner, JubeL ZenpachL JunaL Juzaburo. Tokuheiji. Shinshiro. Given 2 ryo 2 'bu', as reward. 2 RYO 2 lBU' = 750,000 YEN Your petition is truly commendable. Further, Yoshioka Town commoner, Jinnai, given 3 ryo 3 'bu', as reward. He received more, to include predecessors. Where is Asanoya? Actually... What's wrong? He isn't here? He has difficulty seeing... That is strange. I sent a horse and palanquin. I heard he can walk around. Can't even ride a horse? From "Myogakun"... Juzaburo! What is it? Our father's lectures to not ride on horses. Who is he? His name? Elder brother of Jinnai Asanoya. Then you must be... the son of the Asanoya who began saving money? Lectures... about not riding horses? Man is the lord of creation, so must refrain from causing suffering to... an ox or horse, by riding on its back. Really? I haven't heard that before. Could come by palanquin. That is even worse. One man being carried by another... shows contempt, so is not acceptable. Do not make use of men or cause them suffering. Do not cause suffering to a horse by riding on its back. Do not cause... suffering to a man's back by riding in a palanquin. He taught that... people should not cause suffering to other people. Riding in a palanquin... causes suffering to the men carrying it, which is contemptible behavior. Is that correct? You must know who most often rides in a palanquin... here in Sendai? That is all. All of you, thanks for your efforts. You want to die?! You'll give even the reward to townsfolk? Listen, Asanoya. We all gave that money to save your business from ruin. One wanted it for a hot spring trip. And someone wanted to buy fabric for his wife, but... We'll be fine. Are you sure that you won't accept it? I won't. Told you. Just as they said... We did talk about how you'd probably refuse it. However, that would be a problem. Townsfolk also said that they would not accept it. They're in the inner room! What is...?! lam Shigemura. Ouch, that hurts! Sorry, sorry! Shigemura DATE Lord of Sendai Is one of you Jinnai Asanoya? Elder brother, Kokudaya? Yes, that is me. Both refuse to ride on a horse or in a palanquin? That's why I had to come here. My inkstone! Please forgive Kayaba. It is my fault my castle has no money. I also must show some humility. You are a sake brewer. Use these for official name endorsement. Frosty Night Spring Breeze Winter Moon Your business must not be ruined. If you fail because of your Lord, my honor will be stained. No horses or palanquin. |'|| walk home to my castle! Thank you. Thank you! Matazo, from Lowtown. Your 4 kan. In this way, every year end, Yoshioka post-town... distributed interest from the domain, which greatly reduced the post-horse burden. Zuishi Eishu, Master of Ryusenin Temple, wrote a detailed account of this incident. According to his "Koku-on-ki", the Asanoya sake endorsed by the Lord sold very well, the shop avoided ruin. Jinnai used these profits... for bridge and road maintenance, and lived until age 75. Grand Chief Chunai Chisaka... continued to actively support the people, given a bounty of 1.5 tons of rice by Lord Date for loyalty. He achieved his dream, becoming a samurai. Sugawaraya tea became a famous Kurokawa item. Tokuheiji continued to play a key role in future domain negotiations, and died at age 65. I'm Names of the couple side by side on their grave. Interest payments continued for some time, but 40 years later were suddenly stopped by the selfish domain. However, a similar relief project was started once again, and payments resumed. Among the investors at that time... is the name "Shinshiro Hayasakaya III". Paid for about 60 years, until the end of the Edo era, with approximately 6,000 ryo being paid to them. The post-town retained its population, and entered the Meiji era. Juzaburo Kokudaya got remarried, to food shop owner, Toki. Actually, that's unknown, but we hope so... The record says he died four years after fulfilling his dream. His will states, "Do not tell others what I have done". The Kokudaya sakeshop is still in business in Yoshioka.
