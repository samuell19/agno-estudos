I believe in fate. I believe the universe has a plan for me. For... For you, for everybody. Doesn't it, really? So, my question is... is this my destiny? Is this what I've been fighting for? Hi. My name is Arielle. And for as long as I can remember... I knew I was going to be famous. Ew. What is he doing here? Hey. Club called me, and some of the girls didn't show again. Bobby's gonna stick around until I get back. So what, he just got locked out - out of his fucking trailer again? - Quit your bitching, Ariel. - Fuckin' assholes. - Ma, I don't need a babysitter, and he's got his own place. - This is our house. - It is my house. You start paying rent, you can tell me who gets to stay here. Leftover KFC in the fridge. She's way too fucking good for you, you know that? But you ain't. - You're a real piece of shit. - Got any pot? Yeah, I... I do, and guess who's not fucking getting any. Hey! What the fuck? Ooh... Hit that bitch. Maybe if you weren't such a slut. She's a cunt. The video is everywhere. Yeah. Even and my cousin and his friends said they saw it. I can't believe Jeremy hasn't liked any of my fucking photos. You gonna say somethin'? I, uh... I've never really seen you around here before. You saw me yesterday. Well, I meant before that. What are you doing? Cylinder's misfiring. Okay. I'm staying with my dad. So, are you gonna be staying around for a while, then? For a time, at least. What's your name? It's Dean. Dean Taylor. You? You gotta earn my name first, grease monkey. Well, see you around, Dean Taylor. Two first names. I'll have the Cobb salad and an iced tea. Okay. I swear to God, Jason told you. Your cousin's the biggest bullshit artist alive. - He's not. - He lies about everything, even stupid stuff. - That's true. - Whatever. 'Cause he was totally in prison. - Wait, who went to prison? - Dean Taylor. Hid dad owns that shitty mechanic shop over on 2nd. Hmm. Half the fucking town's in prison. I mean, seems pretty all right. Wait. I thought he was, like, living with his mom in Kentucky or something. - No, his mom is dead. - She didn't die. She's just insane. Did you fuck him? No. But I did put his dick in my mouth. - Fuck you, Stacey. - Not all that surprising. - God. - Hmm? I mean, he's like, totally fuckable. Prison fuckable. I'd still do him. Ew. Hey. Hi. Get lost. Slut. You're a little firecracker, aren't ya? So what are you doing here? I'm gonna say that information is at least worth a name. I'm not Ariel, okay? My mom, she fucking named me after a mermaid, but ain't nobody ever gonna call me Ariel. Arielle, then. What about your old man? He around? Well... Daddy called me an accident and then... Last time I ever saw him. I got one like that, too. Except you're staying with yours. I don't got a choice. They say you were in prison. "They"? It's... It's such a small town, and juicy piece of gossip like that would not fly under the radar. So... is it true? Yeah, it's true. So what did they put you in prison for? Armed robbery... and assault. Oh, that's exciting. It is what it is. My parole requires I be with a parent, and my mom's dead. So I'm with my dad. Oh. I'm sorry about your momma. So what's your dad's problem, then? He's a fucking lousy drunk, and he's... bigger than me. Ah. Do you... believe in, like, um... like, faith and cosmic coincidences and all that? Nah, not really. Well... you know, there is a lot to the universe that is way beyond our understanding. Have you ever heard of the idea of, like... if your put out what you want into the universe, that it'll give it to you? What do you ask the universe for? Mmm... Maybe if I'm worth it... you'll have the chance to find out. I don't know, I just... I do know that first I need to get the fuck out of Florida, because... Fuck this place. Seriously. And I've just... I've been saving up a bunch of money, and I'm just gonna leave. All alone? Maybe. Maybe somebody will, um... wanna come with me. I like to think about getting famous, 'cause people around here, you know, all they see is what's literally right in front of them. But not me. 'Cause the world is so much bigger... and vast, and... And beautiful. 'Cause right now, nobody gives a fuck about me. Nobody... cares... who I am. But that's all gonna change. People are gonna be following me, wondering what I'm doing, where I'm going. - How? - I don't know yet. I do know that... the first stop is Hollywood. Us going to Hollywood. Yeah, not sure my PO would approve of that. Now, uh... life's got a really... funny way of working itself out. So we just gotta... put it out there. You wanna see something? You gotta keep it a secret. Ooh. It's a .45. It's big. It'll stop anyone coming your way. You look sexy doing that. All right. Two hands. Two hands. Okay. Just aim and squeeze. Hold it firm. Watch the recoil. Okay. Ah! Try again. Whoo. Ah, close. Yeah! Dean! Oh, yeah. - Go again. - Okay. We're not attacking you. We've just heard things, and we're worried about you. Why? 'Cause of some shit her stupid dipshit cousin said? Hey! You're getting mad. Because... Why are you all attacking me? - He killed somebody. - He did not kill anybody. See, this is why you guys need to get your panties out of Dean's problems and in your own. Because all you give a fuck about is prom or who fucked who. Yeah, and how does this end for you? We're just telling you to watch out. It ends with me getting the fuck out of this place, okay? Because I ain't spending the rest of my life in some stupid speech hometown. And what, you're gonna go off and get famous or some shit like that? Yes. That's exactly what I'm gonna do. And what are you gonna get famous for? People are talking. Like I give a flying fuck what anybody else thinks! Fuck you guys! What? Fuck. Hey, fuck-face! Where is it? - Damn it! - Get the fuck out of here! - Calm down, Ma. Everyone's already seen your tits. - Get the fuck out! - Oh, my God! - Where the fuck is it? - Ariel, what the fuck are you doing here? - A-ri-elle! - For the last time, Mom. God! - Shut your mouth! Where is it, huh? Where is it, you piece of shit? - He stole my money, Ma. - Baby, I'm so sorry. - Ma, he stole my fucking money! - Oh, my God. Nobody stole... What the fuck are you talking about? You piece of shit! Where is it? He stole my money, Ma! I didn't take your fucking money, Ariel! You should die! God! Oh, my God! - What other sick poor loser mooches off my mom, huh? - Stop it! Who else would've done it? You're such a cunt. Ariel... I saved up every dime I could working in that fucking shithole! Get off him! You fucking bitch! I will fucking kill you. What did you just say? Jesus Christ. Bobby said he didn't do it, he didn't fucking do it! Fuck you both! Fuck! Come on. Come on. Hey, it's Dean. Leave a message. Fuck. Dean! Dean? Dean? Fuck off! You... - What the fuck are you doing? - You piece of shit! - You fucking worthless piece of... - What the fuck are you doing? - Get off him! Fucking get off him! - What the... Fucking bitch! - Hey! - Huh? Arielle. Oh. Fuck! Oh, shit! Is he... Is he... - Yeah. - Fuck! Fuck, you, uh... It was an accident. I... I didn't... Yeah. It was an accident. It was an accident. You were defending yourself. Arielle, they're gonna fucking... They're gonna fucking find him like this, they're gonna put this on me. They're gonna bring me back. No. No, no, no. You're not going anywhere, okay? - You're... You'll... - No. - Hey! - No, no. Look, they're gonna... It's fine. It's fine, okay? You're not going back. We'll leave. That's what we'll do, and they'll never find us. You know what? Arielle, I'm fucked. - It doesn't matter. - I'm fucked. Hey, it's done now, okay? The only thing that matters is you and me. So we'll leave. Tonight. - Right now. - Okay. Uh... Do you have any money? Well, not anymore. I'm sorry about that. Yeah, well... We're gonna need some fucking cash. Did you bring the gun? All right, I'm gonna drive up, hop out, run inside quick. And you wait outside with the car. What? Just keep the car ready. I'm not waiting outside. - Look, baby doll... - Baby, I will... stay by the door, I'll keep an eye on the car. We'll keep it running. But I'm coming in. I'm not staying outside. Hope you like green. You're in luck. Get under the fucking... Everything in the bag right now or I'll fucking kill you! All the fucking cash! Let's go! Don't fucking look at her. Hurry, hurry, hurry! Now the fucking safe. The fucking safe. - It's on a timer. - Bullshit! It's not on fucking timer! This isn't 7-Eleven. Open the fucking safe before I crack your fucking skull! Go! - Jesus, fuck! - You look so scared. You are a stupid motherfucker. How we looking out there, baby doll? Yeah, we're good, baby. Hey! Hey! What the fuck are you staring at? You may think I'm sweet and innocent, but you better finish putting the goddamn money in the motherfucking bag, or the last thing you'll ever remember is just how wrong you were. - Move, bitch! - Fuck, yeah! Let's go! Cell phone. - Give me your fucking cell phone! - Okay, okay. Baby doll, get the car ready. Get on the fucking floor, now! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! - Holy shit! - Whoo! Baby, how much money do you think is in this fucking bag? Oh, my good Lord, babe! Whoo! Dead presidents, motherfucker! Whoa! I love you to pieces, Dean Taylor. The way I figure it, we got about 2,000 miles to cover, and gas is gonna run us about, uh... Hey! - Listening? - Yeah. Sorry, my phone's been blowing up all morning. Why? - Now the fucking safe... - How? God, what? I posted it. You posted... Why... Why the fuck would you post that? Bec... Because I thought it would be something people wanna see, and they do. So I took some other photos, too, of the money and stuff. They're cool. And I created a new account. Last night, zero followers. This morning... three thousand followers. Three thousand people... - uh, like what we do. - People are watching that shit? Yes! They... Look... They're liking, they're sharing it. There's a few pretty fine comments. I don't get it. Baby... something like this... - could make us famous. - No. You can't go posting about our exploits on the Internet, 'cause the cops are gonna fucking figure us out, Arielle. No. I am not gonna get us caught, okay? I have an IP blocker. Easy. I'll never show our faces. Look, fame equals money, equals getting out of this shitty, fucked-up town, which is what we're trying to do anyway. Dean... I told you I wanted to be famous. And nobody cares about, like... some random girl from the Redneck Riviera, okay? Now, a couple of teenagers robbing their way across America, that's worth following. I don't know. Feels like an easy way to get ourselves arrested. I already said... I'm not showing our faces. Well, like I was saying... we're gonna need more money, all right? We're almost out of what we got last night, and liquor stores are paying shit. - So? - Well... I was thinking... when I was in prison, they brought in this guy named Chester. It turns out he was arrested for trying to rip off a dispensary. - Like, stealing weed? - No. That's the thing he was going for, the money. So, I looked into it, and apparently dispensaries are having trouble getting bank accounts. Credit card companies don't wanna handle their transactions, - so it's... - Cash. Yes, and lots of it. Plus, the way I see it, security is light, and local police and FBI aren't gonna give a fuck about a weed store getting ripped off. Okay. Okay, I like it. I like it, but... I ain't no getaway driver. Baby needs a gun. It can't be this easy. How do you think I got mine? Private gun sales in Florida don't require a background check. We just gotta find the right one. Boom. Ooh, yeah, Mommy like it. Gotta love America. Do you feel it? Feel what? The power. Like, knowing what we did last night... and, uh... we could do anything. Like... Realistically, we could rob anyone on this beach and turn them all into whimpering little bitches. I know that it was just last night, but, like, it really feels... like a long time ago. In a weird way. I just keep thinking about how all... my friends, like, woke up this morning and went to school and did uh, the same shit that they usually do. And it's just all the same, but... now it's all gone, and it's so weird. Now it's just you and me, baby. God, those lips. Ooh. Look, babe, we're going up followers. Oh. Shit. Baby, the gun guy, he... He agreed. Fuck, yeah. Can we do it? Let's go get some money. All right. Your turn. What? You wanna do this? Whoa! Let me taste those lips first. All yours. Can you do me the honors? Fuck, I'll try. Okay. Uh... Now I'm feeling kinda nervous. That's okay. You'll be fine. And I just ask him where the safe is, right? That's where all the money is. Hands up, you piece of shit! Hands up! That's right. Hey, I've got a question. - You got a safe? - Yeah, it's in the back. - Okay, show it to me. Show it to me. - Fuck, Yes. Yeah, stop looking at him, you fucking idiot, all right? Eyes on the prize. Let's go. Let's go! - But I don't know the combo. - What? What, he... - He doesn't know the combo. - He's fucking lying. Get down. Get fucking down. Please, man. Hey, you think I'm an idiot? Hmm? You think I'm illiterate? You think that I don't know that you know the fucking combo? Put in the fucking combo, now! Don't wanna fucking mess with her, man. That's right. Come on, faster. Faster. What's taking you so damn long? Oh, what, you wanna die alone a little pussy virgin? Because of a couple hundred bucks? Wow! I mean, be my guest. Be my fucking guest and open the goddam safe! Now! Good. Let's put it in. Let's go. - Let's go. - Quick, quick. Looks good, babe. - Don't forget the phone. - All right, all right. Cell phone. On the floor. Watch it. Oh! Oh, my God! Okay, that's it. Fuck, yeah! Oh, my God. Baby! Skittles? I put a few rounds through her. She's all right. Trigger pull? Uh, about five pounds. It's got a nice load on it, too. Sticks up fine. Magazines? I got two in addition to the one that's currently in the gun. What do you think, baby? You like it? Yep. You like it? Freeze. Yeah! - You want her? - Yes, sir. Hands up, motherfucker! Get on the fucking ground! Get on the fucking ground right now! You got it, .45 and nine. You know that shit's good, man. Ooh, yeah, baby, let's haul with this gun. Some magazines up here. You know... anyone comes, asks you about this gun, what are you gonna say? Well... Tell them that the Bay State florist is none of your goddamn business. Let's go, babe. Goddamn, I'm gonna miss... Let's go have some fun. That sounds like one fine idea, baby. Whoo! Well, the universe answered. The videos captured during the robberies and uploaded to social media are the work of Arielle Summers and Dean Taylor, a Florida couple wanted in connection with a slate of dispensary robberies across the South. They're also wanted for questioning in the death of Taylor's father. The couple, followed by millions of people on social media, have been called a modern-day Bonnie and Clyde. Arielle, this is not fucking good. They have our names and they have our pictures. We are fucked. We're not fucked. We're famous. Are you fucking kidding me? Do you not see this is a big, big fucking problem? There's a lot of land between us and Hollywood, which means a lot of fucking cops to avoid, so your social media game is fucking over. - Dean. - Look, I told you to be careful, okay? Not get us fucking caught. Baby, the videos didn't get us caught, the robberies did. And they were gonna figure that out eventually. The video is just... confirming. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just fucking evidence for them. Also, now they have everything that they fucking need. Which is irrelevant if we don't get arrested. How the fuck do you think this ends? You think being, uh, famous for this fucking shit is just gonna absolve you of the crime? How many celebrities have you seen get off easy? It's not gonna fucking work like that, all right? Okay. Plus, I already told you what I wanted. Yeah, and I told you. You fucking kidding me? Fuck. We can outrun him. Speed up. Baby, speed up. No. Just shut up. You better watch your fucking mouth. Don't start nothin'. Is there a problem, Officer? License and registration. Um, I'm sorry, Officer, we... We're just a little bit lost. You see, we're, um... We're road-tripping up to Austin, uh, to... To see my mama, and... Funny, I... I don't know why we can't seems to find it. You know how fast you were going? Oh, that's... That's my bad. Actually, I, uh... I do love to go fast. My... My boyfriend here loves to indulge me from time to time. Uh, we just didn't think we would hurt anybody out this late. Just stay in the car. He's gonna fucking figure it out. Oh... - God! - Arielle, wait. No. Um, excuse me, Officer. I know we were driving a little fast... Miss, get back in the vehicle. We're just gonna try and be on our way now. Miss you need to get back in the vehicle. Fuck! - Get back in the car now. - Officer, she just had a bad day. Let's us just get out of here. Sir, I need you to get back in your vehicle right now. - I have every right... - Arielle, shut the fuck up! I told you to fucking watch your mouth! Both of you, get in your vehicle right now! Officer, please. We can... - Get down. - Whoa... Get on the ground, both of you, now. On the ground. Okay. Hands on your head! Hands on your head! - Officer, let's just... - Shut up. Fuck. Dispatch... - Uh... - Fuck. Okay, okay. Okay. Okay. We should leave. We should fucking leave. Dean, get in the car. Dean, get in the fucking car, now! God! Go. Can I help you? Hello. Miss? Do you need some help with something? No. Uh, I'm all right. You sure? You've just been staring off there for the last few minutes. When are we gonna leave here? - Baby? - I don't know. Well... I'm gonna have to post something soon. 'Cause fans are leaving comments, angry ones, and we're losing followers. That's not good. I don't fucking care. They're not the ones facing the death penalty. Well... we can't stay here forever. You promised me Hollywood, baby. Arielle, you killed a fucking cop. You understand that? Do you know what that fucking means? You wanna talk to me like I'm fucking illiterate? I know what I did. I mean, you know that killing people, much less fucking cops, was not part of the plan. Well, you'd be in jail right now. No, we'd be in jail. And you don't know that, 'cause we could have fuckin' knocked him out or done something else. He had a fucking gun on you. What... What was I supposed to do, just wait around and see what happens? I don't fuckin' know, but killing that cop has landed us in a world of fucking shit. I did that for us, baby. I love you. And... And I want us to always be together. Of course I'm not gonna let you go back to jail. Arielle, shut the fuck up. You did that for you or whatever bullshit fucking fame game you're chasing. We're staying put till I say so. You better fucking say so 'cause I ain't meant to be no housewife. The world needs us. The world needs you. Hands up, you stupid little bitch! That's right. You're gonna listen to me, okay, because if you don't, oh, I don't know, it could be your last day. Do you even know how to use that, little lady? Oh, shit! Now you're gonna listen to me good. You're gonna put all the money from the register in there, now. Go on. Come on, I don't got all fucking day. You're her, aren't you? - I knew it. I knew that it was you the other day. - Faster! Come on, bitch! You were just standing over there, staring off into space. And now you're in over your head. Dave. Shit! Shit! No, motherfuck... Fuck! Fuck! Fuck you! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Dean. Dean, I fucked up! - What? - I fucked up. We gotta go. Jesus Christ, what the fuck happened to your arm? - I got shot. - You got fucking shot? We gotta wrap that right now. Come here. - What the fuck did you do? - He saw me. He saw me. - Who? - He recognized the car. He knew it was me. - We need to fucking go. - What the fuck happened? What the fuck. I tried to... To rip off this... The moron on Highway 2, right, and... The guy... This guy walked in, so I got distracted, and the clerk... Fucking Christ! Why would you do that? We have enough fuckin' money! This is not about the fucking money, Dean! Obviously. But you know, he saw me before, and... And he recognized me. And so, maybe this time he won't actually call the cops. Are you fucking nuts? Don't you call me fucking nuts! There's a huge fucking rewards on our heads! You don't think he's gonna fucking cash in on that? Let's get the fuck out of here before they set up road blocks! All right, get in the back and stay down. Fuck! Fuck. This is bleeding a lot. - Like, a lot. - Fuck! Hold on. - I'm gonna need your help, babe. - Okay. Okay. Ahhh! Okay, I can't hold it for long. Not yet. - Dean, tell me when. - Now! Get 'em, baby! Oh, shit. Well, the whole fucking state of Texas knows we're here. Oh, my God. It's starting to burn. What do I do? Jesus, uh, there's gotta be something in one of the bags. Gauze or whatever. Okay. Where did you put the bag? What bag? The bag with all the fucking money in it. I thought that you grabbed it. No! I thought you grabbed it! I got the bag with the fucking guns! - Check again! - Oh, shit. I think I fucking see it. It's a huge duffel bag filled with money, and I think it's hiding in the goddamn glove compartment. Jesus fucking Christ! We gotta go back. We can't go back. Are you crazy? There's cops everywhere. Arielle, that money was everything that we fuckin' had! Well, you shouldn't have fucking rushed me out of the house! Fuck! Ow, fuck! Babe, watch it. Oh, my God. Mmm, this hurts so much more than I thought it would. Yeah. - That's getting shot. - Yeah, I know. You ever been shot? No. Well, then, baby, I guess I got you beat. - There. - Thanks. Oh. Okay, wait. Real quick, take a photo of me. You're fucking unbelievable. What? Okay, I'll take it myself. What's your problem? My problem? You're taking a picture of your fucking gunshot wound. So? You know how many likes this is gonna get? Who fucking cares about likes? I do. This ain't worth it. You don't fucking get it. - You don't fucking get it. - Guess not. Hey. Hey, why is this so hard for you to understand, huh? What don't you get about this? Why can't you see it? I guess I can't see it 'cause I'm not on my fucking phone all the time. You don't know what this could do for us. - For us? - Yeah. For us? This hasn't brought us anything but fucking trouble! You and your fuckin' followers or whatever the fuck you call it... I don't even know what the fuck it is anymore. Look. We are on a road heading straight for a cliff, and it scares me that you're too fuckin' dumb to see that! The universe put us here for a reason! - I don't know what that reason is, but the univ... - Yeah. The universe... Did the... Did the fucking universe get you shot? - Yes. - Did the fucking universe make you kill that cop? Fuck your universe! Fuck your fate and all that shit! What has it fucking done for me, huh? Nothing. I didn't make you come with me. No? What about my dad? What... What about your dad? - He was a piece of shit. - That's besides the point. I could not fucking stay there. You fuckin' put this on me. - I was trying to help you. - Yeah? It's not my fault you're a pussy who can't stand up for himself. Well, fuck your help! Fuck your fame! Don't you fuckin'... - I said... - Try me! Fucking try me, Dean! Huh? Huh? We're not gonna stop. Yeah. I know. We need money. I got a buddy up in Oklahoma City. Kyle. I met him while I was in prison in Florida. Told me to look him up if I was ever in town. Mmm. Maybe he can find us something. It's out of our way, though. Mmm. They've made sure every county in the state knows we're here. We gotta ditch this car and find somewhere to hide. Get the fuck out of Texas. - Hi. - Hello. You need help? Oh, good Lord, you're a lifesaver. I am at death's door over here. Yeah, my... My car is all jacked up, and my phone died. Well, I can give you a lift. Oh, great. Um, random question. You... You don't got a boyfriend or a roommate or... Or a girlfriend. I mean, I don't wanna assume, at home or anything, do you? Uh... - No. Why? - Oh! Great, 'cause I was wondering if I could stay for a night. With him. Yes, no, maybe so? - Uh, yeah. - Yeah? Great! Come on, baby. You don't have to keep that thing out. You know, there's only one person in the whole world that I trust. He's right there. I know who you are. What? I mean... I follow you online. I knew who you were when I pulled up. No shit. But you... You pulled up anyway. Yeah, I guess. They said that, um... you killed a cop? Yeah, well... sometimes you gotta protect the shit you love. You don't got any beer? Uh, I don't really drink. Vodka? I mean, every chick's got a bottle of vodka in her freezer. Sorry. Well, at least you got food. Authorities are revealing that the couple was living in a foreclosed development for what could have been weeks. They made regular trips to local convenience and grocery stores. We are also told a bag was found inside the house containing very large sums of money. Money allegedly obtained from the many robberies the couple staged across the Southland. Authorities believe, in the rush to leave, it may have accidentally been left behind. Police are now worried that low on funds, the couple could attempt additional robberies. After this morning's fatal shootout with the police, they're believed to be armed and extremely dangerous. Oh, wow. Now we're extremely dangerous, Dean. Oh, we're really getting up there. Do you think we're dangerous? Um... I don't know, y'all seem nice. You got Wi-Fi? Yeah. The, um, networking password is on the fridge. Can I smoke? Arielle tells me that you're, uh, a fan or... follower, or whatever the fuck you want to call it. Mmm. Yeah, I guess so. Mmm. Never met a fan before. Let me ask you something. Why do you follow us? Um... Okay, I... I feel like there is... very little I can change... You know, I work for a telemarketing firm. You know, you get a call about a special offer during dinner. That's me. I studied art in college. Couldn't get a job doing that. And now they're talking about closing the firm and moving it overseas because it's cheaper. And I have student loans. I don't know... I just... feel like I'm stuck. And then there's you guys. You stopped taking it and started giving it. I think people find that exciting... empowering. I think people... are just looking to waste time. And we're it. You know, it's' just, uh... It's a fantasy. Everything about it. I mean, it ain't no way to live. I don't care who the fuck you are. You're luckier than you think. It doesn't really matter. Um, can I go to the bathroom? I see something up ahead. Here we go. Get ready, baby! Relax. It's cool. Morning, ma'am. Can we have you two step out the car? Everything all right, troopers? You boys sure are carrying a lot of firepower. Where you all headed today? Um, OSU. Just getting back from break. ID? - And you? - What? ID. I ain't driving. You don't have an ID? Like I said, I ain't driving. Uh, yeah, funny story, actually. I, uh, left my ID in... In my dorm, and that's why I've got my, uh, sister here driving me back. She's your sister? Um, sorority sister. Hmm. We'd like for you to open the trunk. Don't you need a warrant or something? You law students? Year one. I don't know, maybe I'm just itching for some extra credit. Well, you're right. We either need a warrant or your permission. Now, we'd like for you to be on your way. But if you'd rather wait while we get a warrant and tear this car apart... - No. - ...we can do that. It's fine. It's fine. See anything you like? Thank you, ma'am, for your cooperation. You ride safe. Well, you troopers have a nice day, now. Jesus Christ, it's hot as fuck in there. Welcome to Oklahoma, baby. End of the line, darling. What are you gonna do to me? Mmm. Well, we gave you our word. Doesn't that... Doesn't that count for something? So, you saw that gas station couple of miles back, right? - Yeah. - Which way are we headed, if anyone asks? East. - Attagirl. - I like 'em smart. - All right. Baby, can you close the trunk for me? - Wait. Maybe I can, um... Maybe I can come with you. Nope. Nope. That ain't the deal. - Well, hold on. Hold on. - No, no, she's not coming. Come on, are you fucking crazy? I mean... I can help. No. Elle... this just isn't your path. That's the problem. Now, there's definitely something that you need to take from this experience. There is some big change that Jesus wants you to make. Coming with us, I'm sorry, it just ain't it. Elle, just remember to report your car stolen. Insurance company will take care of it, okay? Oh, you know what? What's your user name? Bunny Robes 26. That's cute. Oh, that's cute. We're hot. I'd date us. Okay. Oh, and Elle... people are really gonna wanna talk to you after this. Tell them something worth hearing. Fuck it, tell them whatever you want. I don't care. All right. Good day, now. She could have come with. Yeah, right. We would have gotten that girl killed. She was nice. She didn't put up a fuss or anything. It's 'cause she's living in a fuckin' fantasy world. Where the fuck is this place? What was this guy doing in a prison in Florida? Well, he was rolling through Miami on a big score. Day before, some rookie cop pulls him over... finds a gun on him and sends him upstate on a weapons charge. Possession. In the fucking state of Florida. Can you believe that? Brother. - It's been a minute. - Hola. Hola. This must be the missus. Arielle, Kyle. Kyle, Arielle. - Pleasure. - Charmed. Well, get the fuck in here. Come on. - I'd love a beer. - Yeah? Well, have a seat. Welcome the fuck home, you two. Beer, coming up. You want any weed, coke, nothing? - I like the place. - Thank you. We're in the middle of redecorating. I was expecting y'all later. Kind of all fucked up at the moment, but... Well, little fun to keep your foot to the floor, right? They sure as shit do. They do. You guys have been busy. I've been seeing you all over the place with your little fucking adventures. Interesting approach. Being so public about it. We've got five million followers now. Five million followers. Mmm-hmm. You should ask all of 'em for a dollar. You won't have to rip off weed dealers. Where is the fun in that? You got a problem having fans? Mmm. Brother, I'm a fan. And you got a great eye. I'm gonna need you to do me a favor. Keep this place... everything in it, off your little... Instagram. You feel me? So... how do you guys find robbin'? We like it just fine. Yeah, I just... I can't get a novel approach, hitting those dispensaries. You have much crowd control in those places? Depends on the time of day. We generally avoid 4:20 p.m. You need help with crowd control? We got something coming up. But I can't have any loose cannons. Well, you ain't gotta worry about me. Is that what you told the cop? "You don't gotta worry about me"? He didn't really leave me a choice. Look, she's good, man, all right? Better than me most of the time. What's the deal? I need a couple triggermen. Trigger... women. - Whatever. - Cute. Its's a big job. A lot of real estate. It's a bank downtown. A bank? A bank. Easy six figures. Each. I won't even make you two split it. Well, truth is... you know, we are short on good help these days. And frankly, anyone who made it through Texas without a scratch in their ass is okay in my book. But, this ain't some bullshit, pot-head picnic. This is the real deal. Think you can handle an assault rifle? I got one in the back of the truck with my name on it. I don't like it. It's a lot of money. More than we ever made this whole time. Well, I thought you didn't care about money. Well, I don't. Not really, anyway. What's wrong? You don't trust Kyle? Do you? Big score, less risk. You said that. That's exactly what this is. - Banks are different. - Well, how do you know? Because it is fucking common sense. We have never done this before. We have never worked with Kyle before. We don't know what the fuck we're walking into. Taking a bank would be huge. - Think about what people will... - This isn't bullshit fucking Twitter, Arielle! It's not fucking bullshit to me, Dean! Okay? People care about me. They care about what I say, they care about what I think, and I like that! Yeah, what about me? Huh? Does that matter to you? Hey. Let's just go. Lets' just fucking get out of here. We'll go to Mexico. Disappear. - I can't. I'm not running from this. - Why? Why? Because of... Of fate? You can choose. You know, I've... If we do this, we do... We do the bank... will you leave with me after? Okay. Okay. What the fuck you doing? Fuck Kyle. I'm not missing this. Everybody get the fuck down! Move! Move! Kyle, why don't you just pull the fucking alarm? Just having a little fun, brother. Okay, people, here we go! Nothing like a good old-fashioned bank robbery - to light a fire under everybody's ass. - On the ground. On the ground. The keys. Wait, we don't have any... Let's try that again. Keys. Let's avoid being a hero today, folks. Nothin' in it for you. - You just need to believe in your families... - Say hi to the camera. ...to wonder why you bothered to give a flying shit when you didn't have to. Check that out. Oh, shit. - What's wrong? - Nothing. - Hey. - Yeah. Watch him. Play it cool. Play it cool. Fucking shit! You're really pissing me off, man. - Where's the fucking money? - What money? It alternates on a three-week schedule. It came in yesterday morning, went out yesterday afternoon. - Kyle, let's get the fuck out of here. - No! The money is here. - Where the fuck are you hiding it, man? - We don't hide it. Why would we hide it if we didn't know you were coming? - It's not here. - Kyle, let's go! - Shut the fuck up! - I don't know who told you it would be here, - but it's not. - Fuck! - What the fuck! - Shut the fuck up! Shut it, shut it, shut it. Calm down. Calm down. DEAN: We got the main door, man. - Let's fucking go, all right? There's nothing... - What? - Nothing's here, man. - What? - If we fuckin' wait, we're going to fucking jail. - Everybody, go. Everybody, go! Move! Move out! Face down on the ground, now. Now. Let's go. Go, go! Come on! - You are fucking up. - Shut the fuck up. Police. Show us your fucking hands! What the fuck's that? What the fuck is that? It's the cops. What? - What? - Cops. Fucking everywhere. Fuck. Shit! What the fuck did you do? What? Nothing. Just give me this shit! You fucked me. - You both fucked me. - Put the fucking gun down, Kyle! We've got ourselves a bit of a Mexican stand-off, huh? Where is all the money you promised us, Kyle? Shut the fuck up, you fucking bitch! Huh? Where are the fucking six figures you promised us, Kyle? Okay. You guys want to go down like this? Fuck it. Hey! Dean? Baby? Oh. Oh. Fuck, fuck, fuck. Baby. Okay, we can get you to a hospital because the police are right outside. - What? - No. Now we both get what we want. No, no, no, no, no. This is not what I want. This is not what I want. Hey. Baby doll. Let me taste those lips. Oh. Fuck. Fuck. I believe in fate. I believe... that the universe has a plan for me. Well, for you, for everybody. Doesn't it, really? So, um... my question is, uh... is this my destiny? Is this... what I've been fighting for?
