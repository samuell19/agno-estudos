On your marks, get set, go! Come on! Faster! Faster! Wolf Gang, you can do it. Come on! - All right? - You all right, mate? Wolf Gang! Wolf Gang! Wolf Gang! Wolf Gang! Wolf Gang! - No! No! - Oh, he face-planted the floor! Get Femi. Get him. - Oh, no. - Get him. - Push him. - Get down! Three, two, one... Wolf Gang! Wolf Gang! Wolf Gang! One, two, three! Wolf Gang! Again. You're not gonna get any chocolate until you eat your greens. I spoke to your mum today. She's definitely coming to visit tomorrow. Why? To see you, obviously. I know it's been a while, but she's super excited. Can I go to my room? Come here. She's not coming to take you away. Do you promise? Here you are. And tomorrow, you eat all your greens, right? Go on, Nathan. Go on, Nathan. Go on, Nathan! - Hold him, Nathan. - Go on, Femi. Femi, wriggle out of it. You've got to wriggle out of it. Nathan, get out of there, Nathan. - Get out of there, Nathan. - Get off! - Come on, Femi, hold him! One! - Pull him off! - Come on, Nathan. Get out of it. - Two! - Get out of it, Nathan. - Three! He's gone. My boy, hm? Come. Ah! It's been too long. You've grown up. I think he probably just needs to get cleaned up and have some food. Yeah. OK. You've nothing to blame yourself over. He's a good boy. Well, you've done a good job. I want to take him back. - Are you gonna tell him that? - We both will. No. I'll tell him. I just... - Just give me some time. - OK. Can I be excused? Finish your food first. Go on, then! Go on. Come at me, then. Come at it, Rick. - Go on, boys! - Oh, no. This is not good. - Go on, tackle him. - Get him! Oh, come on. - Yes! - What a goal! You know I love you. - Hmm-hm. - Hmm-hm. Your mother loves you too. Do you know that? She's been trying to sort a place for the both of you. She's ready now. She's ready to take you back. Are you just gonna let her take me? I know it's hard. You promised. She's your mother. I know. Femi. Femi! Wolf Gang! Wolf Gang! Wolf Gang! Wolf Gang! Wolf Gang! Wolf Gang! Olufemi. Oh. This is my friend, Bimpe. She has been a real blessing in helping me get set up in London. - Good afternoon. - This is Mary. And my boy, Olufemi. Remember Auntie Bimpe? - Fine boy. - Ah, let me help you with this. I think that's everything. We'll wait in the car. You remember how proud I am of you. And I'm always here. Hmm-hm? All in? We're almost there. Careful. There's pee there. Welcome home. That one is yours. There's so much we can do here now that you're home. We can paint it or... or even get wallpaper. Are you hungry? I made stew this morning and we have rice. Or even a little plantain. You must be tired. I'll leave you to get ready for bed. My room is just downstairs, if you need anything. And so is the bathroom. Goodnight. Olufemi. Here. But you've had this before. I made it for you that time when I visited and you liked it. - Do you have any cereal? - No. OK. So I'll finish work at 5pm and then I start another cleaning job straight after. So you'll be here by yourself most of the time before you start school. But that doesn't mean you should just be sitting here watching television. You're not a lazy boy. So I expect you to take care of the house. I need you to sweep, wash your clothes, wash the plates and please make up your bed. What are you...? No, you're just... you're just putting dust everywhere. You do it in the direction outside, towards outside. And you use these muscles in your arms here, otherwise you won't move anything. Here. Go. Please, please. Don't go out anywhere until I can show you around, OK? Olufemi. You never know what's coming in this game. Olufemi. What are you doing? Look at this place. I told you what to do. You haven't done anything. - I said I would do it later. - I did not raise you to be rude. You didn't raise me. Are you... Are you crazy? Who are you talking to like that? Never in your life talk to me like that again. Stand up! - Nan. - How are you, love? I miss you. Hold your ears with your hands, like this. Bend and straight. And bend and straight. Keep doing that. Quick. If you move from that place before I tell you, I will come back here and I will beat you again. - Thank you. - No worries. There you go. Have a nice day. I miss you too. How are you finding everything? I'm OK. - You sure, love? - Yeah. - You settling in OK? - Yeah. I love you, Nan. Are you sure you don't want me to take you? I'm sure. - Close your eyes. - Why? I want to pray so your first day is a success. Bless Femi as he embarks on his first day at school. Send angels to encamp around him. Teach him to be the head and not the tail. So that he may have success all the days of his life. In Jesus's name we have prayed. - Amen. - Amen. But Mary's a Christian. Did she not teach you how to pray or take you to church? There's so much I want to show you. One of these days, I'm going to take you back home. We're a very spiritual family. Your name Olufemi means "God loves me", so you can't be godless. And this isn't just about church. We have our own religion, practised by our family for generations. So it's important that... What? But that's a story for another time. Be good. Cedric, sit down, please. Calm down. Thank you. OK. We have a new student that I'd like to introduce you to. This is Olufemi. Femi. - Sorry? - Femi. - In the register it says... - Just Femi. - Femi. - OK, thank you. - "Olufemi." - Dean. I'm sure you'll all make him feel welcome. Femi! Dean. That's somebody's name. How would you feel about somebody making fun of your name? My name's not Olufemi. I'm all right. Yes, thank you, Dean. I want you all to introduce yourselves throughout the day. OK? So find a moment to go over and make sure that he knows your name and welcome him to the school. Nesrine. - Nesrine. - Here, sir. - Tina. - Here, sir. Leila. Lebechi. Has anyone seen Lebechi? And a new student today. Olufemi Oluwale. "Olufemi." - Just Femi. - It says Olufemi on my register. - Just Femi. - Sir, just Olufemi. - Quiet, Dean. Day? - Here, sir. And Tess. Olufemi, what's going on with your trim? And what's going on with your shoes as well? Your hairline's looking kind of bent as well, man. - Do you wanna get sent out? - What you gonna do? Hey! Out the way! Out the way! - Fight! Fight! - That's enough. That's enough. Out. Out. That's enough. Calm down. Do you know they want to suspend you? On your first day. What are you thinking, Femi? - He started it. - I'm talking, you are talking. But he did though. I had to leave work to come and get you. Do you pay my bills? Do you pay any bills in this house, eh? Do you pay any bills? Olufemi! Olufemi! Yeah, look, look. It's in. It's in. Go on! What a goal! Come on. Free ball. Free ball. Ooh! And again! - Unlucky. - Get me the ball. - Yes, to him? - To him. Yes, to me! - Oh! - Ooh, nice goal. Nice. - Nice to see you. - Nice to see you, Femi. - See you later. - See you. Hurry up! Hurry up! Quick. Dickhead. See the boss man's face? - What did you get? - I hit the jackpot. We've got... - Wine gums. - Wine gums and that? Next thing, some liquorice. Look at this next flavour though. Classic cheeseburger. - Those things are batty. - Is it? Look. You think you've hit big, but I've hit the jackpot so... - Yeah? - Swear. Swear down? - Yeah, I swear. - What you saying? Come on then. Ooh... ah! Yo, is that it? - You don't care about dental hygiene? - Oh, my days. Tayo, man. I can tell you, man, don't care about dental hygiene but some of us do. - Look at your teeth. - Look at you, bruv. - Shut up. - This is why I bought this. For you. What's this? A toothpick? - Yeah, it's a toothpick. - Nah, cuz. You're an idiot. - Tayo, you're wack, bro. - Hey, you too, bro. Fam, shut up, man. - Waste man, what's he on? - It's both of you, fam. Chill. Are you going to Tamara's thing? - Yeah, bro. Are you man going? - Nah. - Bring me, man. - No plus-ones, my brother. - She's ugly anyway, man. - What do you mean, "no"? Yo, that's Mace. Let's just keep walking. Chill. Oi, oi, Mace. Oi, come here. I said come here. Ooh, man like Fems, what you saying? I like this little youth, you know. He was running tings in the school with his little crew. - Yeah, something like that. - Cool. Well, this little prick here's a snitch. And he's gonna squeal for us like a pig on all fours, aren't you? And if you don't, my boy Femi is gonna make sure the job gets done, aren't you? Yeah. Well, he's not squealing. Handle that. Do it. Get on all fours and squeal. Do it, Billy. Squeal. I wanna hear proper snorting. Louder. All right. Get the fuck out of here. Hurry up. Oi, Femi. You got a phone? Here. You can't be a boss without a phone, innit? Ah, see you later. - Cool. You lot get out of here then. - Hurry up, bruv. Shut up. See you around, Femi. Hey, Femi. - How was school? - Fine. Auntie Bimpe's having a small gathering at her place tonight. Do you want to follow me? I already told you I'm busy. - Doing what? - Stuff. What stuff is more important than just spending some time together? Mary called again. I thought you said you were going to call her back. - I will. - When? Whenever I'm less busy, innit? You are here to focus on your exams, eh? I don't want you running around like all these other boys. Yes. Excuse me. Yo. What you listening to? Er... Tupac. Hit 'Em Up. Have you heard the new Wiley ting? Yeah. It's not too bad. They played it at that thing last night. - Look at this guy, man. - Yo. How you doing? Chill. You're always jumping round, man. Why you so hyper? I dunno. Must've got ADHD or something, innit? We're trying to get respect out here. - You can't be acting like that. - Smelly Tope. What you saying? Yo, yo, yo, yo. I'm talking to you. Don't ignore me. - Come here. - What? Let me see this shit. What's this? - Blue horseshit. - Tope. Don't let him do that. What's she gonna do? What you gonna do, blick shit, huh? Yo, he said you a blick. What's blacker, her shoes or her forehead? Oh, yo. What you thinking? Definitely her forehead, innit? - What, you gonna cry? - Hold on. That's enough. No, hold on. Cry. Just let the tears fall out. Femi! Next time, innit? Femi. Are you there? Yeah. Femi. Why is it so dark in here? Saving electricity, innit? - You're always complaining about it. - What's wrong? Nothing. You never want to talk to me about anything. OK. Well, at least you're home. We can have dinner together for once. I have to go out. Where? - Study group. - What study group? With my friends. I don't feel like we're living in the same house. I come, you go... Look, I'm sorry you're lonely but it ain't my fault he's not here. Who? Whoever my dad is. - You don't know anything. - I know he left. That's all I have to know. And one day, I'll leave too. Yo. - Hey. Where you been? - What took you so long, bruv? Hurry up. Mace is waiting for you. In there, bruv. Go. My lieutenant. Come over here. Sit down. You see, when you're the boss, you got to look after the bottom line. Keep your mind focused. Is your mind focused right now? Is it focused right now? Then tell me, what's a man without respect? Nothing. You see, school's good, man. School is good. But what are you gonna do after? Sure you can work for one of them white companies. Let them pimp out your life. Or... you can work for yourself and be free. You wanna be free? Yeah. Here y'are. Hold it in. Ah... Fuck. My lieutenant. So here we are again. I'm sure you've heard a few things this evening that you didn't really want to hear. They are only saying the truth, since he wants to destroy his life. Moving forward, I want to see how we can work into getting him through these exams. Clearly we cannot move anywhere because he refuses to listen. - Femi? - What? "What"? Who are you "what"-ing? Is that how I taught you to speak to an elder? - It's OK. - No, it's not OK. There is nothing OK about his rotten attitude. Do you know how embarrassing it is to come here over and over again - and hear the same thing? - Hm. No improvement. And tonight was the worst. You are not failing me, you are failing yourself. - Hey. - What do you want? Nothing. What you doing out here? Just waiting for Mum and Dad to finish. I should go... - No, wait. - Why? What are you listening to? Um... just some weird stuff. I don't really know. - Do you mind if I listen? - Why? Why not, innit? ♪ Crying for the death of your heart ♪ You were stone white, so delicate ♪ Lost in the cold ♪ You were always so lost in the dark ♪ Remembering you ♪ How you used to be ♪ Slow drowned, you were angels ♪ So much more than everything ♪ Hold for the last time then slip away quietly ♪ Open my eyes ♪ But I never see anything ♪ If only I'd thought of the right words... I told you it was weird. No. No, it's cool. Why are you being nice to me? You know the whole light skin, dark skin thing is a joke, right? You're the prettiest girl in school. You shouldn't let it get to you. You shouldn't encourage it. - I didn't encourage it. I stopped him. - After he had his fun. What are you doing right now? I came out here, saw you, thought we could have a chat. Femi, we don't talk. We're not friends. I'm not friends with your friends. I don't know what you're playing at. My mum's right in there, you know. She knows who you are. I told her about you lot. I don't know if you're trying to be nice to me but you're a bit late, man. You should have been nice last week. You should've stopped him the week before that. Or the week before that. I ain't trying to do nothing. I just wanted to chat to you, innit? Talk to me about what? What, how black I am? How blick I am? Prettiest girl in the fucking school. Say that when your friends are there. What do you want me to say? Do you want me to say I'm sorry? I don't want you to say sorry, I just... I just want you to get it. Just get it. I should go. Bye. Living room. Now. Is that it? No stick? I hate you. I got pulled over by this idiot police officer last week. He said it was one of them routine checks, you know? I asked him, "What's the difference between me and the prime minster?" I know in his mind he was thinking, "A lot of things, you fucking nigger." He has the legal right to kill, steal, do whatever he has to do to protect what's his. But me? If I do all those things, I get sent to jail. The prime minister's the biggest fucking nigger on the road. Go check. How's the phone, is it good? Get you an upgrade soon. I'll sort that, yeah? Nah, it's OK. OK? Nah, you should never settle for OK, man. Let that be a life lesson, yeah? You scared? No. Yo, don't move. If you hear anything, shout us but do not move. What happened? What happened back there? Yo, what happened back there? Gonna be your turn next time. I'ma call on you tomorrow, yeah? Ain't got no blood on it. Take it. All right, cool. - Where have you been? - What's he doing here? You told me you had football practice with the school team. There wasn't any. Sit down! If I knew you was coming, I would have told a better lie. - That doesn't help. - This isn't your classroom. And you ain't my dad so you can't... - Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh... - Femi, believe it or not, I grew up around here and a lot of the boys I went to school with are in jail as we speak. And I was close to joining them. Now, I know to you, I'm just a boring teacher who's old as fuck. But I haven't always been this preppy. Now, your mum and I had a chat at parents' evening, and I think you can really pull through these exams. You've got to let me help you. Your wife's pregnant, right? That's what you said in class the other day. Yeah, she is. First child? Yeah. You're gonna be there for the kid, right? Yeah, I have to be, but what's your point? Nothing. I'm gonna get some sleep. Got class tomorrow. See you there, sir. Femi. I appreciate what you did last night. Seriously, man. Trust is the biggest thing in this game, and you showed guts. If you are smart enough, you can get to a position where you are making decisions, you're not taking orders from anyone else. You can go places. What is it you want me to do? Patience, big man. All in due time. Do me a favour, get me some water and chewing gum in the shop, please. Get yourself what you want and keep the change. Cool. - Mace, that's enough! - Get the fuck off me! Let's go. - What happened? - Where the fuck were you? - You told me to stay in the car. - Just drive. Go inside and sit down. Where you going? Can I go? - How much have we got? - Who's that? He's cool. Shauna. Come here. Hello. All right? How you doing? You know you and Dwayne are the only ones that know about this. I've got a lot of enemies. A man's got to do what he can to protect his family. We're brothers now. I have to get back to class. All right. What the fuck, man? - Let's go, man. Dickhead. - You're bugging me. What the fuck? Femi... Are you all right? Do you want me to call someone? Femi, what's wrong? Femi! You missed my class today. Again. - I'm not in the mood today, sir. - I'm not in the mood either. You come in here stinking of weed, you've got specks of blood all down you. I told your mum you wouldn't fail, not on my watch. That's where you fucked up. What do you want from me? Always a tough guy. Your mum told me about your foster care. I can't imagine what that must've been like. - That ain't your business. - Confusion. Yeah, and what? You don't know shit about it so stop right there. Or what? - I ain't got time for this shit. - No, no. No, no, no. Get the fuck out of my way. You think I'm playing with you? I call my boys and you're fucked. You hear me? Call them. You really think those boys are your friends? You've got every right to be angry. My parents leave me because they don't care enough about me to raise me. Don't fuck with me, man. Send me off to the country to people that aren't my own. I mean it. - And they left you, Femi. - Don't fuck... - They didn't care enough to raise you. - Don't fucking fuck with me, man! I said don't fuck with me. You hear me? I said don't fuck with me! Don't fuck with me, OK? Don't fuck with me! It's OK. Come on. Aren't you gonna say hello? This is our guest, remember? Hello. Hey. Don't forget to eat your peas. When I was here... you shouldn't have said yes when I asked you if I could stay for good. I mean, I know why you did it. But I believed you. Messed me up for a while. I should never have said it. I was too attached. How are you two? Struggling. - Can I ask you a question? - Hm-hmm. Why do you do it? I mean, what's in it for you? Is it the money? Because... I don't know. I wouldn't change being part of you or Ola or any of you for all the world. I'm proud of all of you. That's what's in it for me. In a way, you're all my boys. But we're not. All right, one more time. I'm gonna jump... Oh, my God. You're too strong. - Turbo. - Turbo. Oh, my God. Whoa! All right, you have to carry me on your back now. You ready? Three, two... You've got to be stronger than that. We're going too fast. Slow down. Slow down. What you doing? I hope you come and see us again soon. Let me know how it goes. Bye. See you. Come in. So how was Mary? It was OK. And how are you? I'm OK. OK. Erm... I'll leave you to do your work. There's jollof in the pot. Bro, there's, like, five people speaking in the class. I say two words to my friend, "Yo, give me the sharpener," or something, and he gets onto me. - You know what she's like, man. - Why is she like that, man? Why is she hating on me? You saw the way she was at parents' evening. Yeah. So it's not just me, yeah? - It's not just you, my G. - It's a black thing. Yeah? Maybe. Yo, don't turn around. Just keep walking. If anything happens, you keep walking. Is something wrong with your phone? Yeah. Why didn't you tell me? You know I would've got you a new one. Mace, man. Come on. - Come on, bro. - Big boy, innit? - Touching people and that. - I know you're... Don't ever fucking touch me in your life! - Don't you ever fucking touch me. - Get off me, brother! Don't say my name as well. Get the fuck out of here, man. Are you dumb? What! Got a big mouth, innit? - Hey, get in the car please. - What? I said get in the car! I thought we had an understanding. I thought we were brothers. I guess not. You know what has to happen if you don't do this. I don't want that to happen. - Nothing has to happen. - Yes, something has to happen. All right. You ain't got to do this, man. Fuck! Get up! Hm? Fuck. I didn't bring you here for this. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. No. I know how you look at me. I... I just wanted what was best for you. I... I wanted you to have the best opportunities, things I couldn't have, and I don't know what I could have done. I didn't have anybody. I didn't have anything. And I just... I always loved you. I will always love you. Even... even if you hate me. I don't... I don't hate you. You coming in? Get up then. Welcome, ma'am. Welcome, sir. Can I help you with your bag? Where is he? Why are we waiting here? Your father's wife wants to meet you first. Hello. - This is my son, Olufemi. - Hello, ma'am. - Femi, how are you? - Fine, thank you. Hmm. Erm, OK... I'm just going to go. Do you want some water, sir? No, thank you. Tea, sir? No. I'm good. - Juice, sir? - No, I'm all right. Thanks. - Food, sir? - No, I'm... I'm fine. - You don't want anything at all, sir? - No, I'm absolutely fine. Thank you. Thank you, sir. - You OK? - Hm-hmm. He's waiting for you. You must have questions. Why is my mum upset? Do you know what I do? You're a pastor. Your mum says you are not religious. I'm not even surprised. She's always been a wildflower. You know she wasn't raised by her own mother and father. What? Yes. She has no understanding of authority. She didn't know how to submit the way a wife should. That woman still believes in the old spiritual nonsense. Anyway, you are home now. If you really cared about that, then why have you waited so long? It wasn't my choice for you to be raised by Oyinbo. She had no support. Where were you? Why didn't you invite me to come and live with you? I mean, you've got plenty of space. - Wale. - Yes, sir. Come here. All right, sir. Ade, Sade, meet Femi, your brother. How did it go? What did he say? Nothing important. Let's go. - Wait, wait, wait. - Hey! Hey! What are you doing? - Oh, no, no, no. - Thank you. Oh! That was nice. Come, come, come. Play. Right, right. Oh, in the middle. Come on. You've got it. Whoo!
