Really? So what do you know Mikey, What do you know about a seance? Well we need to get some salt and we just need to like create a little circle with salt. But... Wait, who are you? How do you know about this? You can't be serious? It's not that bad of an idea. What? I've got experience. You do? You've done this before? Yea I've done it before but I completely failed at it the first time. Thats not good. But I'm pretty sure we can succeed this time around. Okay what do we need? We need some salt. Okay lemme just go to the kitchen and get some salt I got some right here. What do you carry salt with you all the time? Yes of course. What are you an alcoholic? Sometimes. He likes Margaritas. Hey, hey before we get into this and we all sell our should to the devil. What was that song that Mikey used to play all the fucking time? Oh my god I'm sure he has it I got it right here. Of course he does. Transcendence. Yea thats it, thats it. Fuck Yea. Hear that? Who was that? Like M, MP. MP or something. MP two... it was MP two. MP squared. MP squared. Thats right. Flyyyyyy. You make a circle like that thats it. Okay. Now we think of, we think of the person who we want to speak to. Okay and who's that? The kid in the other room. What. No I though thats who we are gonna talk to. No. You mean the kid that bit Makayla? Yea. Why would we think of him? Oh man, I thought thats what the whole point was. No we are here for Julz. Yea. Ok then lets talk to Julz then, just think of Julz. Everybody think of Julz and then... and then lets think about Julz. Lets bring julz here with us. Alright sounds good. We can do that. What the fuck are you doing? Shh... Gotta do this. Julz if your here... Give us a sign. Let us know you're here. Your brothers and i are here for you Julz. Give us a sign. Nope, Nope, nope, nope. Fuck I just Fucked up. I wasn't supposed to blow out the candle. What do you mean you were not supposed to blow out the candle what does that mean I panicked Jesus Mikey. Okay, But what does that mean I have no idea. Alright this is the first time I blow out the candle. You said you fucked up, what does that mean, your supposed to know what that means. It means that Julz is here. If anything then we trapped Julz here. Yea because if you blow out the candle you trap the spirit... Here. Good fucking job Mikey. The whole point was to contact Julz not trap him here. I think the best bet is we just investigate the house and leave as soon as we can. Yea, thats a good idea we need to leave here asap. Oh shit.
