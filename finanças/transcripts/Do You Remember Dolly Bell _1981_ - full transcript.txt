Comrades... The situation today is very complex. In recent times, the number of juvenile and adult delinquents in our vicinity has been on the rise. For that reason, we have decided to accelerate the process of forming a dance-band in our recreation club. Look. One socio-political cell in our community has a band. Another hasn't. That can't go on comrades. I've already mentioned this at the organization meeting. You know the problems facing our society at this point in its development. I ask you, why should we be worse than other cultural clubs? If we make a little more effort, we may be sure that Sarajevo will soon become one of the main centers of popular music. That's all, comrades. Thank you. I hereby open the cultural club meeting. I propose the following agenda: The formation of a dance-band. The Skoplje voluntary labor campaign. Third: General. DO YOU REMEMBER DOLLY BELL One dinar lottery! If you don't buy, you won't win! One dinar lottery! One dinar lottery! Will the monkey smoke? Here, your arms are long enough. Don't smoke, fuck you! I'll give you a bashing! Three for you. Three for you. Three for me. What'll I do with this purse? Fuck it! Here comes Marbles! What lies will he tell us now? What a whore that Ljubica is! You wouldn't believe it! We were sheltering under the eaves and I went for her knickers. And, by God, she had none on. I grabbed her bare ass. And then, well, there was nothing else to say to the girl. Crutch, don't interrupt me. You see I'm playing. Playing, my ass! Better listen. If I could lie like you! If you could fuck like me. So I was hammering away... my legs trembling, when a drop from the roof hit me right here like a spike stabbing me. My prick dropped in a second. "What's the matter?" she asked. What did you say? On the beach of the blue sea Where the soft wind blows I dreamed of a lovely blonde Oh, how happy I was What are you doing? Fucking around. Fucking around, eh? Marbles is lying again. Dino, I want to ask you something. God knows where Pog gets to. He only got out of jail 20 days ago. - How long was he in? - Why ask me? Do you have the key? Yes. I'll need it soon. No problem. I'm always here. - What's new with you? - Nothing. So long! What's the date? Does nobody know? The twenty-third. Is it important? No. - It'll be exactly six years tomorrow. - Of what? Of temporary accommodation. They've passed the decision for us. I don't believe it. Always lies. Go to bed. - When'll we go to the seaside? - Tomorrow. Will we really go tomorrow? Really. Lord, this can only happen in Sarajevo. Is he drunk? Not completely. When did the gang go to bed? An hour ago, maybe more. Get them up! Don't, Maho. Have a heart! Get them up! Good evening So? I hit Dino. And you? I was smoking. Lottery. What lottery? They say you're emptying the house! I started a lottery. A dinar a ticket. Well, good. Now write. First item: School. What is it? Dad, it's the holidays. There's no school. Excuse me, Midho. Cross that out. Write: Report on financial undertakings. That's first. Second item: Dino, shit. Write "shit." Write it! Kerim, shit, too. Kerim will chair the meeting. So you don't think your dad's drunk. I hereby open the meeting. Dad to speak. I propose we be brief. We must be more constructive. I personally have nothing against private, that is personal, initiative. We must stimulate individual creativity in our socialist society. Buy buttons for your mammy. - Buy a doll for Meliha. - And my bicycle? - How much is it? - 6,300. Czech make. When you save 3, 150 let me know. I'll go halves. - Dino, fetch some water. - Sena. Don't interrupt the session! Dino was smoking with some scruffs. Not with scruffs. Don't change the subject. And you, shut up! So I belted him. What did we decide last time? That there'll be no smoking. What else did we decide? - Are you writing? - I'm writing. I asked you a question! How long will you fuck me around in this house? "Fuck me around." You hear, Kerim? Shut up! In this house, only I do the belting! I shit on your adult status! Get to bed, the gang of you! Every day in every way, I'm getting a little better. Every day in every way, I'm getting a little better. - Did you practice? - Yes, to 200. Look. This is an exercise to make your eyes shine. Move your eyes to left and right under water for as long as you can stand it. Let's try. - Forty-seven. How many? - Sixty. Can't be, you're counting wrong. You must do it slowly. I won't wash my eyes if I ever fuck her! Who? Ljubica. I've got a date with her tomorrow. Listen! You don't learn hypnosis for that. Hypnosis should change the world. When a man gets control over himself with the help of auto-suggestion. Understand? That's all right, but what'll I do tomorrow? You're going to sleep. You're going to sleep. You're going to sleep. Your eyelids are heavy. Your eyelids are heavy. You fool, you can see I'm not sleeping. Your eyelids are heavy. It's clear, but... Fuck the discussion... Check. In a dream... What happened? Twice without taking it out. Liar! Twice bare-back! Twice, I swear it! Yes, it seems it's true. Another check. "In a Blue Dream" by Antun Gustav Matos! The younger generation! Every day in every way, I'm getting a little better! Return my "Secrets of the Occult." - Don't bother me, Marbles! - Turn it off. Pog's here! I'm always alone... alone... alone... Why do I wander The wide world When the moon shines You, only you... You're the only one in the world The only joy of my heart You, only you... You're made for only me You'll be mine forever only you Tripes! - Give us a drink! - I can't really. What? The warden's forbidden it, honest! Smajo? Not Smajo. The new bloke. That four-eyes? Yes. Excuse me, comrade. Four-eyes, scram. I don't like trouble. Get the hall ready. See those boys in the corner on the right? Where? The one with the bandage? That's your band? No, but it will be. That one in the middle, Dino, he'll sing. What's he like? Fine. Knows everything. Licks me at chess. I'm not asking about that. I mean... delinquency? Well, he's inclined to it. The one with the bandage is Rasim Gun. Back from reform school. Deaf from a fairground shooting. The one with crutches, accordion. Him on the right, bass. Looks wild. Son of a soldier killed in the war, Vlado Marbles. Look at this! Does anyone want a new state apartment?! - Don't keep me in torment! - I'm only asking. If you want it, it's here. Here, look at this. Put a round of drinks on the table. Music! Shall we dance? Communism must arrive by the year 2,000. Don't drink! You won't make better communism! You think there'll be no alcohol under communism? No chance. From each according to his abilities, to each according to his needs. You'll quit drinking. With communism, it'll be easy. With communism, they'll all be false dilemmas. What do you think? Under communism, there won't be any dilemmas. Control over one's self, communism, and that's it! Must I repeat, communism is a science? A matter of the liberation of the proletariat. There are no individual cases there. That's what I'm saying. That's what you say. You just think about that hypnotism crap. White paper and a black dot to stare at! - You haven't a clue. - And you have, eh? So we see! Balls, woman! Everyone needs to create communism in himself. Then it'll be easy externally. That means for communism we needs a good hypnotist. If that's what you think, it's different. Don't play tricks. It's your crap. The end of classical German idealism. That's what it resembles. Marx sorted that out. I've got nothing against your Marx. Why does hypnotism bother you? It's idealism, reaction. Communism is forged in factories, my boy. Fuck all the rest. Clear? It's clear. It couldn't be clearer. Let him sleep. Humanity has been sleeping for 2,000, 3,000 years. So why shouldn't you? Is there anything more important? - Then why have you waited? - For pigs to fly. That's my little smart aleck. He'll go far. Will I ever move out of here, dear God? You're going to sleep. You're going to sleep. Your eyelids are heavy. Your eyelids are heavy. Heavy. Beat it! Just one successful experiment will help us by auto-suggestion, to overcome all the problems. The patients of a doctor, by repeating a verbal formula, cured themselves. It was: Every day and in every way, I'm getting a little better. And those words worked miracles. - Is there anyone up there? - No one. This is one of my girls. She'll stay with you a while till I settle some business. Understand? Yes. No problem. - Clear? - It's clear. This is a nice boy. You've no need to worry. And you, jerk, don't make me any trouble. - You know me. - Don't worry about a thing I tell you. I'm not saying what worries me. Off you go. Go on, you cunt, do you want me to slap you! See you. How can I sleep here? There's a place upstairs. Come on. Come on. It's fine here. It's late. I'll have to go. Are you hungry? Well, I could eat. I'm not sleepy, though. Wait, I'll get you something. What are you doing at this time of night? I'm just getting some bread. Sleep. I'll sleep when I'm in my grave. You only love once. Who do you take after? - Good morning! - Where've you come from? - From bed, of course. - You're up early. I've got things to do. BUY BREAD AND MIND MELIHA, MOM In the pigeon-house? No. With the guys. We're going to llidza. Any girls? What girls, Dad? We're going swimming. Good. But what have you got against girls? Women are like salt. You can do without, but it's lousy. I'm off. It's good for you. What? Llidza, where you're going. Forget that hypnosis and auto-suggestion. - Do you need any money? - No, thanks, Dad. You can't do anything today without money. First the material basis, then the spiritual superstructure. Thanks. There, now you can go. And forget that hypnosis. We're going to your aunt's this afternoon. Good morning. Pero is a male. My uncle Besim gave him to me. He's a traveling salesman. All the rabbits he's got! They've no children. His house is full of animals. And? Nothing. What's your name? Dolly Bell. Really? Really. Dolly Bell! You're joking. Dolly Bell's blonde. I can be blond too. - Sonny has a hairdresser's in Milan. - Who has? The bloke who brought me. Why are you acting dumb? Ah, yes. Sonny. Did he give you that name? Yes. How does it suit me? Very well. Don't worry, it's my brother. What a heap of shit! Fuck this! - How much did you pay? - Nothing. 200. I could have bought 20 eggs for that. And I thought you weren't coming! Yes, I really thought you weren't coming. Why not, by God? If I said I was coming, then I was coming! - Where are the little pricks? - Don't swear. Cheers! Aunty will come now. Want one? I don't smoke uphill. You wouldn't even if you wanted. That's my problem. Give me one. - I can smoke uphill and downhill. - I see. - Shut up! - I've shut up. State's business, not mine. Why not? You're a free man! Don't talk crap. You know what Marx said. When there's freedom, there'll be no state. If Marx could hear you, he'd turn in his grave. Cut out that nonsense. Have you nothing else to talk about? The old mustached one turned him over nine times! - But look what you have to live on. - Well, cheers. Here's hoping you live 200... 300 years. Don't exaggerate. Here's the children. Here comes my band! Hello. Have you forgotten your uncle? - Go to the side. - Come on, sit here. Come on, son. - Uncle will come now. - Sit down, dear. Sit. Daddy, when will we go to the seaside? Ask your mammy. Mammy, when will we go to the seaside? - Ask your daddy. - Daddy, when will we go to the seaside? Soon. Soon. - Shall we? - Play away! It's lonely for me... Alone in Sarajevo... It's lonely for me... Alone in Sarajevo... Dino! - Are you mad? - Sit down, Sena! Sit. Let them toughen up, motherfuckers! I lie down and rise alone... Don't you know any happy songs? You got him to sing this! Only the poor go in for ideology and religion. I'm surprised at you. Come my desire... Let me kiss your lips... Let me kiss your lips... He always gets like this. Sena, don't spoil my fun. You spoil it for everyone else and just enjoy yourself. Aren't you ashamed in front of your sister? Bourgeois phrases about the family. The closeness between parents and offspring. Shit. The family should be abolished! - You're right, it should. - God help us! What about that coffee? It's from the Manifesto. - Then abolish it! - I didn't say it. Take your clothes and abolish it. Marx meant bourgeois family. I know what Marx meant. You shut up! I'll break your neck! Let's dance. Will the sun ever shine in this town as it should? It won't, Dino. Never. - You'll get wet. - Scram! - Come in, Maho. Don't be a fool. - I won't! I don't want to! Don't then! How are things with you, Kerim? Tomorrow I'm off to Skoplje. On the voluntary work campaign. How are your school marks? What shall your uncle buy you? A bike! Shame on you, how can you mention a bike! Why not? Your uncle will buy you one. Every day in every way, I'm getting a little better. Every day in every way, I'm getting a little bit better. Trying to teach me what Marx meant! He'll correct me no more. I've got Marx at my fingertips. Marx is a fine man, a good communist. - Drink it, man. It's not poison. - Take it away. Take it away. I'm going tomorrow, Dad. Don't come back without a Work Award! Sit there! You see they're sleepy. Leave them alone! I've had enough of sleepy ones. I won't hear of it! Don't shout. You'll wake the neighbors. East and west arise North and south arise March to the attack Forward, comrades, side by side March to the attack Forward, comrades, side by side I've got something nice to tell you! - Has he come? - Who, Sonny? He hasn't? Here, to comb your hair. Thanks. What's that? - It's for my practice. - What practice? - Hypnotism - What's that? A suggestive power to gain control over ourselves and others. In the interest of general progress and the conquest of animal instincts in men and people in general. That should transform the whole world in general, but my dad doesn't agree. He thinks we can reach communism without hypnosis. Where's that? It's not a town, it's a condition. It's when everyone will have everything they need. It must be nice there. I agree... with our comrade. But at Bjelave they've had a band for a year already. At Hrasno they're practicing. The comrades from the local committee have promised us a guitar and an accordion. We cannot allow that our young people go to other clubs to dance. We have gathered here and gathered here, in order to employ a part of our leisure time in the best way. That is, in order to express our artistic tendencies. Such work means... the creation of an independent program, the development of brotherhood and unity, the strengthening of self-management relations and making of new friends. In our club, there's room for all creative people, for art and for all good friends. And a drummer? I don't think that will be a problem either. Sejo, you'll stay with the folk group. This is something else. I wouldn't drum for that row, not for any money. - Gun will play drums. - No problem. The club will provide the money for instruments. All you have to do is practice. Listen. They've bought instruments. We'll be a real band. What band? Drums and guitar, everything. The warden said you should come to practice. Come here. Sit down. - Where've you been? - With the guys. Here, light up. I don't smoke, Dad. Really. I know you don't. But light up. Even the shepherds know that stuff of yours. What stuff? Hypnosis. Auto-suggestion. When shepherds shear the sheep. You understand? That's hypnosis too. I've heard about it. Every creature has on its skin certain surfaces and when you touch them they cause a secretion in the brain that blocks physically whatever it is we're talking about. Nothing exists outside the material world. It's all chemistry. And chemistry is physics, physics is biology. Understand? It's all dialectics. Put that out. Look how he smokes! What? I'm singing. What was that you said? It's Italian. Con venti quatro milla baci. What does that mean? 24,000 kisses. Who counted them all? It's a song. You sing it. Out you go. Have you got a girlfriend? Yes. What does she look like? Dark. With big tits. Do you know how to kiss? I know. Every day in every way, I'm getting better. What's the matter with you? It's important your nose doesn't get in the way. Move your head. Open your mouth. Not like a fish. Now put your tongue out. You've got to rub with your hands everywhere. Fuck you... you know. Who taught you? A student last summer. He's from my village. I thought it was Sonny. No. He was my second. And he doesn't like kissing. I don't know why. Dino. Dad's calling you. Please, let me see! It's not good at all. Maho's going to kick the bucket on you. Don't joke about it, Maho. Let me see, mammy! Meeting. Regular or emergency? Emergency. Midho, write. I, Mahmut Zolj, son of Sejfo, and mother, Zejneba, maiden name, Hatibovic, born 1920, resident of Sarajevo, France Preseren Street, number... - Twenty-four. - Twenty-four. Manager of an express restaurant. In the event of my death... Of sound mind, under coercion from no one, thus freely... dispose of my moveable and... - Are you writing? - I'm writing, ...and non-moveable property. My wardrobe I leave at the free disposal of my wife Sena, to be done with by her as she wishes. But this does not relate to my tobacco tin, lighter and cigarette holder which I leave in the sole possession of my son, Dino. To him I also leave nine books of pure Marxism. What is it? You'll have a long life. You'll fall truly in love once. You'll die a natural death. You'll have a lot of money. Someone in your family will soon die. - Come on, don't fool around. - Seriously. Don't joke. Let's go on. Come on, give me your hand. Shall I go on with my dream? I dreamed I was flying. I waved my arms a few times and I was flying over the streets of Sarajevo. People were looking at me, amazed I didn't fall. I dived at them. They scattered. I skimmed a meter above the ground, rose again, flew on... Is it funny? No. - Shall I read to you? - Yes - Really? - Yes, yes! Contemporary mankind has progressed so much that it can be asserted that man can influence climate changes according to his wishes. Correction of the globe's axis is being considered. Firstly along the edge of the north and south... No, that's not important... Listen. In the intellectual sense, such a man would be as far above us as we are distant from the apes. Go on. What are you waiting for? And you. And you, Marbles, what are you waiting for? Open up! Sonny! - Get upstairs. - What is it? Upstairs! Go on! Get undressed! Sonny, what's the matter? Get undressed when I tell you. Do you hear? Fuck you! Up you go. What's up, Marbles? Why are you so tense? Your ass gone tight, eh? Where are you going? How my ears are ringing! Rasim, tell the old girl to heat the paprika. On the sea's blue beach Where a soft wind blows I dreamed of a blonde Oh, how happy I was And as I spoke to her Her lips trembled so... Marbles, are you doing anything? I am, I am... What are you sniffling about? - Who's sniffling? - You, you cunt, I'm not crying. Honest I'm not. I'm not crying. Did you screw her? Yes or no? Did you? I did, by God! Wake up, Pero! - What? - Dad's going to the hospital. When I consider it, I have nothing to tell you. You've got brains and spirit. Don't rely too much on one or the other. Keep a wife. Loneliness is bad. That's the worst illness. But you don't go to the hospital because of it. Who knows? It seems that man's a hopeless case. Did you hypnotize the girl in the shed? You're joking! I'm seriously asking you. - Did you do anything? - How do you mean? Sensual work on the basis of elementary drives. Sex. Well, a bit in the mouth. What in the mouth? We kissed. Not bad. You must be phlegmatic. Women like phlegmatic types. Oh, fucking words! Gun, don't thump like a horse! Your concentration's bad. Something's wrong with the rhythm. Are you listening to me? I'm listening. Listening, my foot! Is it serious with your old man? Seems so. You've fallen for some girl? Seems so. Who is she? My business. I thought you could tell me everything. I've nothing to say. Listen. Keep away from that Pog The police have come to see me. He escaped from jail not long ago. He's taking women to Milan. Prostitution. How are you? Any better? How are things at home? Just as usual. Has Kerim come back from Skoplje? Let's walk. And Sena? Working. Does she cry? Yes. In the evening. Help her, lad. Forget your fooling. This isn't a joke, you understand? - I understand. - Here's the doctor. Hello. Well, that's it, on your way. Do you need any money? No, Dad. Thanks. - Five dinars and I won't tell. - Who? - Kerim. - What won't you tell him? Is it sick? You know it's not. - How much do you want? - 1,500. There are some fools about. What would you give? You're not a fool. 500, if it's not sick. If you'd said 1,000, we could talk. Here's a thousand. If it's sick, you give it back. Agreed. Otherwise I'll knock your head off! Good evening, it's my pleasure to introduce the guest of the evening, Dolly Bell, who after a long and successful tour of Asia, Africa and Europe, has decided to perform at home. Let's watch "Midnight Blues." I'd like two young men from the audience to come up here. You. Would you like to? Two men. Come up on stage. Would you be so kind? Take this end. You hold the edge at one side. You at the other. You'll see you'll get a special prize! And now, dear guests, the moment has come to present the star of the evening, the charming Dolly Bell. A hand for Dolly Bell! How are you? Are you all right? I live. How did you find me? Four-eyes told me. Who's that? The warden of our club. He's from here. Pog made him angry. Does Pog come here often? Once a week. When he feels like it. Why don't you undress? I'm waiting for you. You're sweet. Sonny. Pog! More. - I don't have any more, honest! - More! I swear I don't! You don't, eh? Ah, it's you, Dino? Not like that. Bite, for Pog, bite. How did you find out where she was? She wrote to me. Mam, did you see the letter? No. Not by post. Through Four-eyes, the club warden. And then? Then it all happened, till Pog came. He wanted money. She didn't have any. He started to kick her around. Then I jumped on him. - Liar! - Don't provoke him, Kerim. I headed him in the guts and had him down! Waited for him to get up, then a right, then a boot between the legs, and he fell. Then I left him. Okay, make it brief! So, liquidation! His children mix with pimps, and him... liquidation! Bankruptcy. Write: One. Are you writing? I'm writing. Sell the pigeons. One A: With the money, buy a bicycle. Two: Demolish pigeon-house. Demolish the house. That would be best. - Pine. - Boards, yes, pine. Sena, don't weep. They'll be good for firewood. Good. Let's continue. Where were we? Nowhere. We're finished. To bed, you gang of crooks! So he did hypnotize her! Hey, cyclist, rest a bit. Was she pretty? Yes. Very pretty. Read on. But contemporary science and technology have progressed so far that today man may influence the climate according to his wishes... Help me turn him over. The entire work involved could be done by an army of a hundred million scientists from all over the world and would be done in a lifetime. First a huge bulwark would be built along the north and south poles. And instead of the exceptionally harsh climate of minus degrees, after the correction of the Earth's axis of rotation, there would reign eternal day in an eternal spring. Seems... a good idea. The restless green mass of the Indian ocean disturbs the balance of our planet and causes it to rotate on its axis at an angle. By draining the Indian ocean, the land surface would be increased by 91,200,000 square kilometers. Transformed for cultivation, this area would feed about 146 billion people. - How many? - 146 billion. And how many of us are there now? Two or three billion, I don't know exactly. Don't count me. Is there any more? By liberating it of the water of all the oceans, it would be lighter by 72 quadrillion tons and distance itself from the sun by 30 million kilometers. A year would last 425 days instead of 365 and there would be only one season, fresh summer. That's clever of them, by God! Will anything come of that, you think? I think it will. Good. That's a good idea. And your auto-suggestion is good. Keep on with it. Is there more? The Earth's gravity would be reduced, and the reduction in the body weight of living beings would make it possible for them to grow to gigantic size. Men would be real Titans. They would grow into giants. Life expectancy would be between a thousand to five thousand years. In the intellectual sense, such a man would be as far above us as we are distant from the apes. Put him down on the floor. Towards Mecca. What are you doing? He was a communist! Lift him back up. And you'll see when we go home, fool! We had a meeting at the community center. Cica got us new instruments. We'll have drums, a guitar. Vlado and Gun will go mad. Don't tell them anything. The Youth activists of the Crni Vrh cultural club welcome comrade Cica and would like him to announce the dance. My dear young people... Our dear friends... I can't express my enormous satisfaction, that is happiness, to be able to invite you to enjoy our first entertainment. Comrades, it was a hard and difficult task, but one that has been crowned with success. We have got our own dance-band. These youths have sacrificed their summer holidays. They have practiced and rehearsed to greet the first days of autumn in our club with the sound of their instruments. These boys have shown exceptional love for the art of music, and have entered into the work of our rich amateur scene, where we act, dance, recite, paint and so on. Thank you. On the sea's blue beach Where soft wind blows I dreamed of a blonde Oh, how happy I was On the sea's blue beach Where soft wind blows I dreamed of a blonde Oh, how happy I was And as I spoke to her Her lips trembled so And in my arms She cried while kissing me Oh, if I could only see her one more time To ask her if she loves me To tell her my heart aches And that without her My whole life is sad On the sea's blue beach Where soft wind blows I dreamed of a blonde Oh, how happy I was And as I spoke to her Her lips trembled so And in my arms She cried while kissing me Oh, if I could only see her one more time To ask her if she loves me... Every day in every way, I'm getting a little better...
