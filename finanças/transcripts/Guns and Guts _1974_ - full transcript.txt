(twangy Western music) (gunshots banging distantly) - Yah. (horse whinnies) (rooster crows) (horse neighing) (light Western music) (dog barking distantly) (donkey baying) (rooster crows) (horse whinnies) (gun clicking) (rooster crows distantly) (horse whinnies) (rooster crows distantly) (knocking) (grunting) - He left town a couple of years ago. (grunting) (groans) (gasping) He don't live here no more. (grunting) No, I own this business now. (grunting) (glass shattering) (rooster crows distantly) (grunting) - So he was kinda scared of something, and beat it fast. Okay, I believe you, I believe you. I believe you. Thank you. (groans) Six. - Hmm. - Six. - Mm-hmm. (groans) (sighs) (light Western music) (knocking) - Howdy. - [Man] What do you want? - Talk to you. - Talk, and fast. (gun clicks) (gun clicks) - I think we're both looking for the same man. - What's that to do with me? - Maybe together, we could find him. - What do you want him for? - That's my business. - Why should I believe you? - Because we're both looking for the same thing. (gun clicks) To kill the son of a bitch. (gun clicks) (light Western music) - Let's spend the night in this town. Branca's still a long way off. - No, I prefer camping in the hills. - If month's the problem, I've got some. - No, thanks. - We could use a good rest. - No one's stopping you. Until we're out of this region, I can't be seen in any town. The law and I ain't on speaking terms. - All right, man. Let's move on. (clicks tongue) (insects chirping) (dog barking distantly) (muffled piano music) (grunting) Hold it. Let him be. (groaning) - Is this your man? - Nope. - Mine neither. (clattering) (groaning) Let's go. (laughing) He ambushed our partner and put the blame on me, so he could own everything. Then, he accused me of the killing, and the law put me in jail. Why do you wanna kill him for? - That's my affair. - Like a drink? - Not now. - It's been a long time since I've had a woman. - [Woman] Let me go. - Let her go. - [Woman] Leave me alone. - I said leave her alone. - What are you buttin' in for? - She's my property. - All those? - Mm-hmm. They're my property too. - Bought 'em or something? - Yeah, I paid for them until the morning. - Think you're man enough to handle them all? - Yep. And you too. Don't draw. You could get hurt, and bad. You're looking for trouble, hmm? Well, I'll make you a deal. Let's leave our shootin' irons on top of the bar, and let's fight. - Suits me. (tense music) (grunting) (chattering) (humming) - [Woman] Oh. (humming) (grunting) (piano keys banging) - Stop it! (grunting) (humming) - Had enough? - Yeah. Enough. - Whiskey! Hey, whiskey! (panting) Now have a drink with me, but hands off my women. - All right. (spits) - Where do you hail from? - No place. (chuckles) - Where you going to? - Somewhere. (chuckling) - Kinda talkative, huh? - Where are you going to? - Someplace. - Where you bound for? (chuckling) - Nowhere. Hey, come here. You like it? Huh? (moaning) - Shall we go on? - You like her? - Mm-hmm. - I'll lend her to you. But you gotta bring her back in one piece. - It's a deal. - My good deed for today. Come here. You wanna try one of my gals? - Nope. - That's your tough luck. I'm usually not very generous with my pretty little rabbits. Hey. (chuckling) - [Man] Come on, baby. This is going to be fun. - Wait a minute. Take it easy, baby. (chuckling) - Gee. (chuckling) What a beautiful carcass. (sniffs) Wow. - We're searching for a man. - Why? - To kill the bastard. He stole my wife. - And you want her back. - Nope. But he's sure gonna pay the hard way. - That's why I like whores. They never fool you. - Gee. I've always dreamt of this moment. Of having a girl like you in my arms. - No need to dream anymore. (snoring) (clattering) - Morning. - Morning. (sighs) - How'd it come out? - Pretty good. - Of course. She's one of my best. - Yeah. Wake up. Come on, let's go. Move, come on! (spitting) Let's make a break and get going. Thanks for everything. - Oh, forget it. Now you know where I hang out. - Yeah. Come on, move! Come on, get up here, move! Don't have all day. (muttering) All right. Come on. Let's go. (groans) Be seeing you. - Bye. - [Man] So long. (humming) - Goodbye. (rooster crowing distantly) (birds chirping) (coughing) (sighs) - Where you aiming for? - Santa Fe. - That's where I'm going. Mind if I join the group? - Come on. (light Western music) - My gals are the best in the world. That's why I love them so. They're sincere and give pleasure without problems. Never met decent women. No point to 'em. My little kittens never pretend, and we sure have a good time. One day, when I'm rich, I'll retire all my whores in a big ranch of my own. A sort of a big brothel with only one customer, me. Once I almost fell in love with one, but I got away just in time. Even as a kid I liked 'em. I spent all my dough on 'em. - [Man] Didn't your ma object? - [Man] No. She was one of 'em too. (somber Western music) - Whoa. My horse kicked a shoe. Let's find a smitty. Yah. (tense music) (metal clanking) Listen. You got time to shoe my horse? - Yep. As soon as I finish this one. (metal clanking) (tense music) - Killer! You're gonna get what's comin' to ya. - Is he talking to you? - No. - Guess he means me. Looking for me? - Yeah. You murdered my papa. - What the hell are you talking about? - I'll remind you. - Why don't you go home, son? Can't recall your pa, but if we shot it out, you can be sure it was face to face. - You're a hired murderer, and you was paid to kill him. - Let's forget the whole thing. Don't make me draw. - I figured you was yella. Killer, I'm gonna count three and shoot. - Don't be stupid, son. - One. Two. Three. (gunshots banging) (horses neighing) (gasping) (gunshot bangs) (fire crackling) - I can't recall when I started shooting for real. These are things better forgotten. Blood calls for more blood, and our crimes leave a long red chain. Lily-livered cowards hire me for what they ain't got the guts to do. That's why I prefer my whores. No obligations, no kids. And when I kick the bucket, there'll be no tears and no cross on my grave. (water lapping) (bird cawing) - How far you going with us? - You know, I guess we separate any place now. - Got something to do somewhere? - Mm-mm, not for the moment. - You want a job? - Like what, like a gunslinger? - Probably. - About that man you talked to me about? - Mm-hmm, yeah. - What for? There's two of you. - You said that cowards hire gunslingers to do the jobs that they don't have the guts to do. I was thinking that I probably wouldn't have the balls to pull the trigger. Money's no problem. - Hmm. All right. (light Western music) (birds chirping) - Come in, brothers. This is a house of God. - You can spend the night here. We'll have your beds ready. - Thank you, Father. - Don't mention it, don't mention it. - We're pleased to put up strangers. - And what do you men do? - Well, I'm a business man. - I'm a government agent. - And what do you do? - Me? I'm a school teacher. I run a girls' school, and I give all my time to my little girls. - What do you teach them? - Oh, lots of things. - Do you have an specialties? - No. A little of everything. But I prefer the study of the human body. - Oh. - Hmm. Teaching must be nice. - You're not kiddin', Father. (bell clanking) - It's time to retire. Here we go to bed early. Friar Jose will show you to your rooms. - Excuse me, Father, I gotta go to town to mail a letter. - If you wish I can take it tomorrow when I go for provisions. - Thank you, Father, but you see, this is urgent. It's a message for my kids. - Good night, and God bless you all. - Good night, Father. - See you. - I'm taking Father Damien to his cell and come right back. - Well. I feel like teaching tonight. I expect to find some nice, beautiful pupils. I'll be back early. (tense music) - That's him. When he arrived, I remembered this wanted poster. - Get the men together. - [Man] Cards? - [Woman] One. - [Man] Cards? - [Woman] Two. - Two, okay. Cards? - One. - Okay. I'll take four. - 10. - I call. - Okay. - I'm in. - 10 and 20 more. (knocking on door) - Who is it? - [Man] Can you open up for a minute? (gunshots banging) (somber Western music) (gunshots banging) (grunting) (horse neighs) - 50, and 50 more. - I'll pay. - And 50 more. - My 50. - Cards? - Two. - And you? - One. - I'm packed. - Hmm, me too. - Pass. - I pass too. - I'm bettin' the whole thing. - Okay. Your cash and everything you've got on. (chuckles) - Mm-hmm. - Okay. - Full house. Tens and aces. - I lose with a flush. - Four queens with a deuce. - Hey, take it easy. Four queens with an ace. (women laughing) - What kind of a deck is this with eight queens? - Shut up and pay. - Uh-huh. (laughing) (grunts) Don't ever bust in like that on me. - Gotta talk to you. - You sure come at the damnedest time. What happened? - The sheriff and his men surprised us. - What happened to our friend? - He got wounded and taken away. - What do you want us to do? - Rescue him. - Stand by. I'm going to wire the governor to send some men. (light Western music) - My hands sweat when I'm afraid, but they're dry now. - What do you do to keep them dry? - I think of my four girls I left naked. - [Man] Who are you? (gunshots banging) (cell door rattling) (groaning) - It's not too bad, it's just a flesh wound. But if it's not healed, it could get infected. - Yeah, he ought to see a doctor. - Yes. My foot ain't gonna fall off. - Why not disinfect it? - How? - Piss on the wound. Well, it's not the best remedy, but we got nothing better. - I reckon you're right. - Do you want me to piss on it? - Hell, I can do it. (groaning) God dammit! (birds chirping) - You'd better go alone. Out man doesn't know you, and if he's in town, we better have two bands. - All right. But this is where my job begins, and I always get 50% in advance. - Why should I trust you? - That's your problem. - All right. - We'll be in touch. (horse snorts) - Think he'll beat it with the money? - I don't think so. These professional are usually pretty honest on the job. (light Western music) (horse neighing) (light piano music) (patrons chattering) (laughing) - Oh. - Hi baby. Hey. You're really nice. I like 'em skinny and hot, just like you. (girls giggling) Fact is, I love 'em all. Come over here, baby. - Everybody knows him. He's the sheriff of Santa Fe. - Sheriff? - Yeah. - Much obliged. Bring us two whiskeys. - This doesn't change my plans. - Mine neither. - Come on, come on girls, let's have fun, huh? - Maybe he don't want to tangle with the law. - Let's find out. - Honey, a man like you is entitled to a discount. - Or I pay full price and get what I want. (laughing) (cheerful piano music) (chuckling) - Why you ornery son of a bitch. - Well I'll be. Still with the same bunch. - When you stood me up, I wanted to become a nun. But at the convent, they wouldn't let me entertain my boyfriends. - I had to leave after I finished the job. - Suppose you killed someone and it wasn't in self-defense, right? - Wrong. It was in self-defense. I had to collect the reward to keep on living. Long time no see, baby. - More than a year. - How come you're here? - A league of decency ran us out of most towns. (patrons laughing) I never felt I'd ever see you again. - Why? I always come back to you. - Yeah. And then skip out. - Ain't my fault. - No. It's the eternal hunt of the eagle after the snake. - But the snake's smart, he always gets away. - Until he's cornered, and then it's too late. - Baby. I need a bit of your professional services. - When you didn't come back, I felt miserable and alone. - I still feel the same way. - I understand you're a good hand with cards. - So-so. - How about a game? - Don't mind, if the stakes are good. - Suits me. - Baby, you don't mind waiting for me till I get some money from these guys? - All right. But if a client shows up, I'll have to take care of him. - Hope he don't. Otherwise I'll have to shoot him, and that'll be for free. (patrons chattering) - Cards. Top bet 100, and everyone deals once. - I like seeing the dough on the table. (cheerful piano music) - I'll deal. - The man we're looking for is the sheriff in this town. - That'll cost extra. Give me two. - Just one. - Two. - Only interested in money, huh? - It makes life fun. Probably one of these days I can retire my girls. Is there a deal? - All right. I'll pay you double. - You know, if they get me, I want to be buried with my dough, 'cause I don't want nobody to owe me nothin'. 20. - I'm in. - I call. - Gotta work out how to meet the sheriff. What do you got? - Three deuces. - Full house. - I have to figure out how to get to him without being obvious. Four friggin' rabbits. - You palmed a card. - Some guys died saying less than that. - If they did, they must've had a lot of reasons. - Maybe. But they never had the time to prove it. - Room for a fourth? My cash is good. - Welcome, friend. Sit down. (cheerful piano music) Full house. Four chickadees. Straight. Four double breasted dames. Hmm. - There's something here I don't like. - Any doubts, friend? - Better we forget it. - Better. - Anybody could see that you were cheatin'. - You oughta be more careful. - Look. I'm sure our friend will hightail it to the sheriff. And it's a good way to meet him. - Baby, you know what? I've met a lot of girls, but none like you. - Is that a compliment? - If my plans work out, I swear I'm going to take you out of all this. (sighs) - The same bullshit again. - Oh no, I really mean it. I promise, I'll take care of you this time. - Please. Don't raise my hopes. - Baby. - Hmm? - Everything's gonna be just okay. You know, there's a lot of money involved, and I got a feeling we can start a whole new life together. (tense music) (gasping) - Uh-uh, hold it. Take easy or we shoot. - Get moving. - I'm busy. Can't you wait? Can't you wait until I'm finished? - You're under arrest. - Can I get dressed or do you want me to go out like this? Don't fret, baby, I'll be back before the sheets get cold. Okay? - Take it off. - You know, I've got the feeling this is a prison, and I've been condemned. - Oh, it's just an old hacienda that I made into my headquarters. In Santa Fe, the law must be respected, and that you can only get through force. You know you've been accused of cheating in a card game? - That's right. - And you admit it? - Yep. - You know you can be jailed for this. - Yep. But before, I'd like to talk to you alone. - I don't discuss terms with lawbreakers. - It'd be worthwhile. I mean, it would be good for both of us. - I hate to waste time, so I hope that whatever you have to tell me is important. - It is. Do you know why I cheated? - Nope. - So I'd be accused to cheating and get to see you alone. - Oh, and why didn't you come straight here? - I didn't want certain folks to know about it. - Who are you and what do you want? - Two men hired me to kill you. - Which two men? - I never asked their names. - Why do they want me killed? (chuckles) - Got reasons, I reckon. - Why are you double-crossing them? - I'm practical. I know I could never kill you in this fort where you live. - That the only reason? - No. I gotta get some dough and retire, before I cash in my chits. - Who's gunning for you? - A couple of fellas. And sooner or later, they'll get me. - So you're a hired gun. - Yep. I always work for the highest bidder. - And what's your price? - Five grand. - Hmm. It's a deal. Where are these men? - Excuse me, but I always get 50% in advance. It's the custom. (chuckling) - Where are they? - You can find them at the hotel. (gunshot bangs) - Get moving. - Well, well. Like old times, we meet again. My dear partner. So you jumped jail, huh? - Yeah. To kill you. - Sorry to upset your plans, but I heard about your escape, and I was waiting for you to show up. I never forgot your threats. - I always do what I promise. - Well, you won't this time. What about you? Are you still riled at me? This is how I picked up your trail. - Why, was this necessary? - Yes. I wanted witnesses to prove that you were paid in full. We're even now, take your money. - Sorry, friends. He paid more. - Friends mean anything to you? - Nope. Can't trust 'em. Everyone has his price. - I was also informed that you were planning to kill me, you damned idiots. Here it's nigh impossible to get me, and I seldom go out, so I won't meet fools who have old debts to collect. I won't have you killed because it's not worthwhile. Besides, I represent law and justice in this town. As for you, you'll be taught a good lesson before you return to where our father is buried. A lesson that you'll always remember me for. - I'll never forget you, brother. - You stay here, under arrest, till we get you back to prison, where you'll sweat out your seconds. - I'll get out again and kill you with pleasure. - I doubt that you'll even want to. Take them away. - Where is she? - She's dead. - I'd sure like to know something. - What? - Like who elected you sheriff. - I did. - Can I get my gun back? - They'll give it to you outside. Hey wait. You know, sometimes problems come up that the law or its representatives shouldn't handle. It's very convenient to have people under salary to take care of things. So, I like to have you around. - I'm staying here a while, and if someone pays my price, I don't worry about the client. - I'll send for you. Staying at the hotel? - No. At the cat house with the prostitutes. I always stay there. (laughing) (tense Western music) (horse neighs) - As soon as you get up, get the hell out of here and don't come back. - And keep your trap shut about who did this to you. (dog barking) - Before returning to prison, I have a special souvenir for you to take back, as a reminder that you shouldn't have even thought of killing me. (chuckles) (shouts) (shouts) (light Western music) (insects chirping) - You stinkin' traitor. - Careful. You could hurt me with that. - I'm gonna shove it into your goddamn throat! - Cut the shit. Can't you figure out? Everything I did was to get the sheriff's confidence. Later find a chance to finish him off. - You're lyin'. - Only from the inside could you possibly get to the sheriff, and I found a way to open the doors. I picked you up and brang you here. What I ever do that for if I was aiming to double-cross you? (somber Western music) (gun clicks) - Are you sure he's not coming back? - Yes dear, absolutely. My brother's an awful coward, and after the lesson he got, I'm quite sure he's not coming back. (tense music) - You've been checked and now I know who you are, where you're from, and everything you've done. - [Man] Everything? - [Sheriff] Most everything. And I know you can be trusted. - Thank you. - There's another job for you. We're sending the fugitive back to jail. The law must be obeyed, you know. The posse leaves tomorrow, and I'm interested that he doesn't get there alive. - Dead people tell no tales, eh? - You'll get another 5000. - When do you want that to be done? - Well, that's your pigeon. My men leave early in the morning, and they have orders not to shoot at you when you show up. - How'd you know I was gonna-- - Why, you said it yourself. Everybody has his own price. (chuckles) And by the way, make it look legal, huh? - And my 50% in advance? - Oh yes, yes. Yes, of course. Here you are. Better complete this time. To catch up to the posse, keep to the north road. - I know. - Good luck. (tense Western music) - You leave at dawn. After our friend attacks and kills the prisoner, you open fire and kill the bastard, yeah. You can always say it was in self-defense. - Baby, this is our last night here. In a few hours, we're gonna start a new life. - I can hardly believe it's us you're talking about. It's almost too good to be true. (laughs) - Meet me at the coat station. We'll hop the coach, no matter where it's bound for. - I'll be there, all right. - And as soon as we get someplace where nobody knows us, I'll bury my irons. And you'll never again have to be everybody's kitten. Only mine. (somber Western music) - Get ready! (horse neighs) Come on. Hurry. - Sorry friend. This is my business. (gunshots banging) (horse neighing) - I'll blast any son of a bitch that makes a move. - Howdy, friends. (laughing) (tense Western music) - Open up! - Come on, move your ass. Let's get going. - Excuse me, sir, they're back. - Thanks. Get out. (tense Western music) - Careful! (gunshots banging) (horses neighing) (somber Western music) (cheerful piano music) (patrons laughing)
