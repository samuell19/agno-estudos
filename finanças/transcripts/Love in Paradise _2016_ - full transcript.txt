I'm Avery Ford... and I "aim to please." Lose the smile. Now you're scowling. Tip up the hat so we can see your eyes. They're bloodshot? - I didn't sleep. - Great. Lower the hat. I'm Avery Ford, and if you love the west like I do, you don't wanna see another sundown without Chuck Wagon Beans. I'm Avery Ford... and I "aim to please." Cut! I guess that's a wrap. Beautiful, Mr. Ford! That's a wrap. You think I could get an autograph? Sure. Who do I make this out to? "Susan." Susan. Is that your mom? Your sister? Actually, it's my grandmother. She's a huge fan. Great. - Thank you! - Yeah. That was good. What am I doing up there? Y-You got me selling beans. Well, you'll be eating them without this endorsement. You need the money. Well, maybe you should cut your commissions. Well, 10% of nothing is still nothing. I'm just not sure I can do it anymore. You can and you will, because you signed a contract. Look, I said "hazelnut coffee," not candy. Get... yeah. Look. Quick, please. Look, you always doubt yourself between movies. I'm not the only one. Well, the studio's just playing hardball. They'll come around. Really? Why? 'Cause the world needs Aim to Please 6? Fast and Furioushas seven. Well, horses aren't that fast, or furious. Look... It's hazelnut. Everything is fine. You're Avery Ford. Yeah. Still. Dinner tonight? I don't think that's such a good idea. Why? You're not still seeing, what's-her-name? No. Well, then? Come on. You know I'm still half in love with you. No, you're not, and it's the other half I'm worried about. - Evening, Mr. Ford. - Fred. This came for you. Thank you. No, no. You... You go ahead. I'll, I'll catch the next one. Going into the final round before eliminations, and let's see what our chefs have got for us. Terry's poached his salmon with a lemon vinaigrette that he's just now starting to drizzle. High marks for aesthetics again, but if smug looks count, that will keep him well in last place... Dad. Come on, haven't you seen that one? Well, you know me. I like old stuff. Well, then you won't mind last night's coffee. Hmph. Could be worse. Could it? Maybe not. I can't believe it's almost winter. Yeah, we open in two weeks. I better get to mending those fences. There's time. I thought we had a group booked opening weekend. They canceled. Was a time we were booked solid year-round. And we will be again. Heather, I appreciate what you're trying to do, but every ride's got to end. Since when do you give up? I'm a realist, if nothing else. Maybe this is our eight seconds. It's not. We just need a little jump-start. You know, something to put the ranch back in people's minds. I was thinking... A promotional event. You know, bring in a guest to kick off the season, generate some publicity. Like who? If people don't want to come, we can't lure 'em in like fish. How about we bring in a cowboy? Honey, all my old cowboy friends are either too busted up to travel or six feet under. Anybody else out there got somethin' to say? Well, I got somethin' to say. I can't guarantee you're gonna like it. Then again... I aim to please. How about him? It's 10:00 a.m. It's 10:00 a.m. Siri, what's the weather today? The weather in New York is sunny with a high of 52. There is a 10% chance of showers. Hello! Am I late for something? No, but an intriguing offer just came in. Doesn't have anything to do with beans, does it? What are you doing next weekend? Red Sox/Yankees, home plate. Record it. You're going to Montana. Where is that? Wait. That's west of the Hudson River, right? You heard of Casey Twain? I've heard of MarkTwain. Let's see. Casey Twain, World Champion Saddle Bronc Rider, eight gold buckles. Well, he owns a dude ranch near Big Sky, it sounds like a five-star resort. Every famous cowboy has stayed there at one point or another, and they are hosting a PR event for you. - Why? - They're fans. No, I mean really. You're so cynical. Hey, I'm from New York. Cowboy calls me up out of the blue... Well, actually, his daughter called, and she sounds perfectly normal. Yeah, well, so did Kathy Bates in Misery. No. It's one weekend. All you gotta do is show up, sign a few autographs, meet a few fans, eat a steak. I'm a vegetarian! Thought you were over that? No, I'm actually thinking about going microbiotic... The studio is really excited about this, and they're putting out a press release. I didn't say yes yet. I said yes for you. But I'm not going, because I have to host something else here... It's a new client. Really? Who? Tyler Mahoney. What? He's, like, 15? He's 20, and we are launching his new brand, but I'm available to you 24/7 on the phone. Great. Yeah. I'll send you a text from under the stampede. And his steak tartare... I know you hate jeans, but buy a pair. Okay? Get a spray-tan. It looks like you haven't been outside in a year. Hey. Mr. Ford. How are you? Did you have a good flight? We're just down here. Wow, this is it? I just figured there'd be a little more... The door's, it's a bit sticky. Sorry. So, I'll see you tomorrow at the shindig? Shindig. Yeah, I'll be there. Great. Mr. Ford? I'm Heather Twain. It's Avery. And thanks for being a fan of my movies. I can't tell you how many times I've seen them. Got a favorite? That would be hard to say. Yeah. There really... isn't very much around here, is there? The way I see it, there's everything. That's Curly. Hey, Curly, boy! She's a girl. Yeah, that... That was my next guess. Ooh! She could stand to lose a few? No, no, she's pregnant. Right. Well, congratulations. Who's the father? You wouldn't know him. Curly! Go. I see you've lassoed a suitcase. Leave it here. We'll come and get it later. Um, my stuff's in there. Yeah, it'll still be there when you get back. Guess I have been in the city too long. A cowboy in New York. You must miss the wide open spaces. Got Central Park. It's 834 acres. You walked it off? Google. You have been in the city too long. Are you limping? Nah. Just... Just an old riding injury. Wouldn't have anything to do with those new boots, and, this, would it? Yeah. You got me. It was the airline, they lost my boot bag. You don't wear your boots? No, my feet swell up when I fly, and... Well, we got saddle soap in the barn. To soften up the boots. Right. So, you... you live here, a-all year round? Yeah. It's home. Come on. The property was homesteaded in the 1880s. My great-great-grandfather turned it into a working ranch, and, eventually, a dude ranch. Wow. This... it's rustic, you know? Thanks. Where's all the people, though? I sort of figured there'd be a lot more going on. We don't open up for another two weeks. A lot of people coming in for you tomorrow, though. You've got a lot of fans around here. Well, "I aim to please." What? My movies? Right. You know, my dad is really looking forward to meeting you. Yeah. Likewise. I mean, I can't... I can't tell you how long I've been studying his career. He was something in his heyday. You ever see him ride? No. Not... I mean, personally, in person. He's slowed down some, but he's still got it in him. Come on, I'll introduce you to him. He's out with the horses. Horses? I don't want to... Bother him. You can help him break in the new pony. I can't. There's... There's phone calls. I have to return them, check in. Of course. I'll show you to your cabin. That's the original cabin. There's rooms in the Main House, but I figured you'd want your privacy. I should warn you, cell reception's a little spotty. Best spot is the hay loft in the barn. But you... you do have Wifi? Yeah, we haven't gotten around to that yet. What? This is you. This... is me? Wow. Bunk beds? Haven't slept in one of those for a while. The top bunk has a great view. Kind of like the penthouse? So just give a holler if you need anything. Hey... You got any bottled water? Straight from the lake. So I'll see you at dinner. 5:30 okay? You eat at 5:30? 5:00 better? No, I'll hold out till 5:30. Great. It smells good. Where is he? That's him? Airport boots, and his suitcase is on wheels. Boy. A real pleasure, Mr. Ford. I'm a big admirer. I feel the same way, and it's, Avery. Call me Casey. And you can put your purse down, son. This is a messenger bag. I, I just don't like to leave my tablet unattended. Well, we have that in common, then. I don't like to leave my hat unattended. How 'bout a drink? Okay. To long sunsets and happy trails. Doesn't get any better than that. How do you like your steak? Any way it comes. Well... Blood-red's what I like. Wow. That's big. Wait till you taste it. I gotta say, your movies kept me company through a lot of long nights. Yeah, well, it's, legends like you that gave me something to emulate. Well, I wouldn't say I'm a legend. I've heard you say it a few times, Dad. So, Avery, we don't know much about you, other than what we've seen on the screen. Yeah, I like to keep my private life private. No wife or kids? No. Haven't been down that trail. - Heather's single, too. - Dad. Just laying the cards on the table. Let's keep the cards in the deck. Well, they gotta be dealt sometime. Right, Avery? - Not a pig person? - Not per se. All right. Come on, Curly. Come on. Lemonade? Great. Good stuff! You know, my agent didn't really give me a schedule. Maybe you could shoot me a text. Or I could just tell you right now, since we're right here sitting next to each other. Why didn't I think of that? Breakfast at 7:00. Then you'll mingle with the guests, give a little talk, and sign some autographs. Don't forget the open pit barbecue. You like ribs, right? Yeah. More meat? Perfect. You sawed through that steak pretty quick. Want another? No! No. I'm a one-steak kinda guy. But it was great, and I'm... Just the trip... it's kinda got me all worn out. Ooh, I think... If you don't mind, I'm gonna... I'm gonna turn in. I wanna thank you guys for a very memorable dinner. Of course. Thanks. I'll see ya. Hello? Yeah... Y-You hear me? I-I can't... Can you hear me now? - Hello? - Hello? Candace! Listen. You have got to call this thing off! Not a chance. There's press coming, and the last thing that you need is bad P.R. What is that noise? You have gotta get me outta here now! I am trapped. In a barn! With animals! And hay! Made of wood! And yes... I... Hello? Avery? No, no, no, no. No...! Man! That the steak you loved so much? Okay, you caught me. I don't eat meat. I gotta get this in some rice, stat. Rice? Y... Ooh! Maybe hay will work. Could you be any less of a cowboy? I am an actor. Yeah. We fake things. Like your entire image? It sells movies. The ones you pretended to watch. I was being polite. "Polite"? Were you being polite when you said this place was a five-star resort? No Wifi? This... We don't need the virtual world. We have the real one. You know, Paradise Ranch is legendary! - So is Pompeii! - There are a lot of... people showing up here tomorrow to see you. Not a problem. Yeah, I can keep the charade going another 24 hours. Can you? I've been doing it half my life. You awake? I am now. Room service? You missed breakfast. You have a cricket in your room. It's a sleep aid. You know we have real crickets here? Good, save me some battery. The press arrives in 20 minutes. Is that enough time for you to iron your jeans? I got permanent-press. Hey! Could put a log on... He's cute. You have a boyfriend. You don't. And trust me, when I do, it won't be him. Hey. Hey, thought you said half the town was gonna be here. This is half the town. Hi! Hi! I'm Jen, Heather's best friend. And, um, unlike her, I've seen everything that you've ever been in. Thank you. I'm, I'm honored. And here he is now... Fresh out of the saddle... Paradise Ranch is thrilled to welcome Mr. Avery Ford. Thank you. I'm, I am thrilled to be here. You know, we have a saying in New York... Trust your neighbors, but brand your cattle. Mr. Ford? Will Matthews with the Montana Gazette. I'm a big fan. - Thanks, Will. - I think all of us... want to know when is the next Aim to Pleasecoming out? Well, they tell me it is just around the bend. It's been three years, now, right, Mr. Ford? Yeah. Aren't... Aren't you the kid that picked me up at the airport? Yeah. I'm also a reporter for the Elkhorn Press. What is that? My high school paper. Great. Well, you can tell your readers that, um, I'm still "aiming to please," and like all good rides, it'll be worth the wait. And, as promised, Mr. Ford will be reading one of his legendary scenes. This is embarrassing. Without my reading glasses, my arms are not long enough. Try mine! Sure... Okay. Um, well... You know what they say. Whatever happens at the dude ranch... stays at the dude ranch. "There's no place in life to really find yourself "like being on the back of a horse. "Everything just looks better up there. "The grass is greener, the skies are..." Do you want me to run him off? No, I'll do it. You're trespassing. I thought the whole town was invited. Everyone except you. Is that a way to treat an old friend, Heather? - We go way back. - Not far enough. And we're sure as hell not going forward. I'll come back when things quiet down. Don't bother. You know, we're gonna have to talk about this, Heather. It's not going to go away. Wow, you guys are actually eating fruit. I promise not to tell. Pardon me, Mr. Ford, sir? Can I get a few more shots of you? The light is perfect right now. Sure. Where... Where do you want me? On a horse would be great. How... how about over here? You know, by the barbecue? "No better place to forget about your troubles than on the back of a horse." Right, Mr. Ford? Yeah, but I mean, guys, come on. I mean, how many times have we seen it? Horse, cowboy, I mean, that image... How many times can we do it? Not enough for my liking. I'll go get the horse. Mine either. It's a classic! - It's classic. - Classic. Classic! "Classic." Excuse me. Dead man walkin'. Coming through. This... is a horse. Yeah. I've seen one before. Central Park? Mr. Ed. Get on. Okay. What are you doing? This, is what I do. Yeah, I just come over, I get like this, the director sends a stuntman in, but this is as far as I go. Just step up and swing your leg over. Just do it. She's sweet. Step and swing your leg over. Come on. One, two... Three! Get on there! Okay, there. No, no, no. Don't go away. Whoa! I'm a trained professional. It's all right. You know, in pictures, we have professional horses. Very smart. They don't do anything stupid, like... Stupid... Thank you for interrupting your poker game. You did me a favor. I was losing. Follow my finger. How'd this happen? - I... - He fell off Buttercup. "Buttercup"? Would you feel better if she had a different name? I couldn't feel any worse. She can be a bit persnickety. Yeah, runs in the family, from what I can tell. Well, you have a mild concussion. Doesn't appear serious. Great. Then I can get on the next flight outta here. Sorry, no flying. The altitude pressure could cause swelling. - How long? - To be safe... about a week. A week? A week seems like a really long time, Dr. Frank. Yes, it does. Better safe than sorry. I'm not sure I agree with that philosophy. I know I don't. I'll be out to the ranch in a few days to give Henry his shots, I'll check in on you then. - Who's Henry? - You haven't met Henry? He's uncomfortable around horses. What kind of doctor are you? Large animal vet. Anybody seen my stethoscope? You took me to a vet? The "people" doctor was on vacation. Quite a ride, Mr. Ford! Great, so, there's only, what, one doctor in this town? There were two. The other one passed. Don't worry! You're in good hands with Dr. Frank. Well... frozen peas, horse doctor... Here's your opportunity. Could use a drink. Put the peas back on your head. They're melted. Hey. There's Avery Ford. Hey, you two! So... Is this... Is this like a date? - No. - Absolutely not. What's going on? - You didn't see it? - See what? Where'd you get that? They're all over the Internet. My... And it just keeps getting better. You were supposed to bring us publicity. Well, apparently, I have. There goes the season. The season? What about my career? What's left of it. Drink, please. Instagram, Twitter, Snapchat... CNN! It has gone viral. Are you seeing this? No, no, because I'm still living it. Well, I just got off the phone with the studio, and they are distancing themselves from you. What does "distancing themselves" mean? It's polite speak, but they are killing the movie. And they want your holding fee back. Can they do that? Can you just get out of there before this gets any worse? I can't travel. What? Apparently, the altitude can cause swelling. What is that noise? They call it music. On the house. Thanks. You're lucky I'm sworn to uphold the law, Clem, or I'd have killed you already. No. No, no... No... Sorry, wrong door. Sorry. Did I mention I was sorry? Twice. Yeah. Buttercup looks good. We look like idiots. Honey, if I worried about what people think, I wouldn't have climbed on that first brock. There's no way that he is staying here a week. We've had worse guests. They were paying guests. Hello? Dr. Frank, thank you for getting back to me. How's the head, son? It's better. Any memory problems? Unfortunately, no. I remember every detail. Hey... If you haven't fallen from a horse, you haven't ridden long enough. Yeah, in my case, I'm not sure that applies. It always applies. I don't know why I came here. I'm sorry, Casey. You think I didn't know you were a city slicker from the first film I saw? You might have those New Yorkers fooled, but you can't snow an old cowboy. Why didn't you say anything? Well, I figured you could at least ride a horse. I've got stunt guys for that. See, I act like I'm mounting up, and then I act like I dismount. Here, come here. What? Sign it. Why? I still like your movies. At least I used to. The last few have gone off the rails a bit. Yeah, more like a train wreck. When's the next one out? It might be a while. I can wait. This is cool. Thanks. What is it? Just kidding. Everybody knows even a horse needs a blanket, right? I've been making them ever since I started riding. I'm pretty sure they're more for me than the horses. Anyway, Dr. Frank says that there's no problem with you driving. Dr. Frank the, large animal vet? There's a rental car place in Billings. You leave now, you could be home in three days. I'll just wait it out here. I'm not much of a road trip guy. I thought you couldn't wait to leave. I don't drive, okay? What? What, you're going to make me say it again? How do you get around? I take cabs, subway. You know, sometimes, I walk, when I'm not wearing boots. I guess you are stuck here. Yeah. You might like this one. Wow. He's so young here. Is this the championship ride, Amarillo, '71? How did you know that? Are you kidding me? That is like rodeo history. Casey Twain, Wendell... I Googled it. You know, you're very lucky here, with the books, the movies, you've got all the classics. Yeah, I think I've seen everything in this room at least once. Everything but mine. Can I ask you something? I don't see why not. There's not much left to hide at this point. Why'd you start doing western movies? I squint a lot. You know, looks good when I'm wearing a hat, 'cause I have a big forehead, it cuts it down... You know. I always wanted to be an actor. It seemed like a great way to escape from real life. In a highrise? Group home. That's what they call an orphanage these days. I'm sorry. Nah, it was a long time ago. I can't imagine not having a family. I can't imagine what it would be like to have one. Still, it's a lot to overcome. I started working at a deli in Queens when I was 19 years old. I am having trouble picturing that. Are you kidding me? The paper hat, rocking a hair-net. Anyway, one of the customers comes in, and he's a producer, says he likes my look, gives me a bit part in this Western. The rest is history. Okay... I watched the first one. I thought I was just going to start, but then I got caught up. 'Cause you like me. I might have to watch the rest of them. I mean, just to see how it turns out and stuff... You like me. Let me save you and stop before the last two. Make that the last four. Excuse me for a minute. Sure. Stop wasting your time. The answer is still no. Okay, just hear me out, all right? We'll offer you twice what we paid J Bar Ranch. J Bar... you practically grew up there. You loved that land. Now, what are you gonna do, turn it into condos? A strip mall? Can't you see I'm trying to help you, Heather? I mean, if you turn down our offer, we're still going to get this place at auction when the bank forecloses at the end of the season. Not if we have a good season. You haven't had a good season in years. Quit dreaming, Heather. I mean, just take the money, and you and Casey will have enough to find another place somewhere else. This isn't about money. This is our home. Now, get out. God, I mean, you want to walk away with nothing? I think maybe you should walk away. Well, this doesn't concern you. Do I look concerned? When you come to your senses, give me a call. When the phone doesn't ring, you'll know it's her. I took an improv class once. They said, you know, make a strong choice and go with your instinct. Not bad. Yeah. Boot jack. There you go. And try these. They look used. They're buckskin. Trust me, they'll be a lot more comfortable than those airport boots. Let me ask you, that, that fellow, Guthrie. Is he the reason I'm here? I thought some good publicity might change the tide. Yeah, well, I ruined that for you. Nah, it's not your fault, and this is a long time coming. My family history is here. I just can't let it go to those people. Who, developers? Yeah, the worst kind. No morals, lots of money. You know, they strip the land, pour some concrete, throw up buildings. When J Bar Ranch wouldn't sell, someone went and ran off their cattle, ruined their entire business. I grew up with Guthrie. He should know better than to work for people like that. How much longer do you have? The loan comes due at the end of season. And now... you two are shopping together. Apparently so. We're all out of saddle blankets. I'll bring some more tomorrow. Mr. Ford! Good to see you again. You need to borrow my reading glasses, you just let me know. Or he could just buy some without the pearl chain. Third aisle, by the fertilizer. No harm in looking. Heather, Lola and I have been doing some talking, and we want to lend you a little something, for the ranch. Thank you, both, but you know we can't take your money. Besides, it's going to take more than a little something to keep us going. I can't bear to see them foreclose. This town won't be the same. I know. Hazelnut? Try one. You were right about what you said, about modernizing? Probably should have. You know, Wi-Fi, video games, latte machine. Nah, you wanted to keep the place authentic. People used to come here for the experience. Not anymore. I might have been wrong, about the modernizing. That's nice of you to say, but you're still mourning the loss of your tablet. No, no, I had an awakening. Yeah, I don't have to ask Siri about the weather, I can just step outside and see for myself. Who knew? So when's your next movie coming out? It's not. The studio dumped me. What, because of us? No, I think they've been looking for an excuse. Truth is, I haven't really done anything worthwhile in a long time, and... It was great at the beginning, you know, and I'm grateful, but lately, I just feel like I've been going through the motions. Like a pair of boots that don't fit anymore. Yeah, I reckon so. You know, I'm no expert, but you started acting to escape your real life. When do you ever get to live your real life? That's a good question. One trail ends, another one begins. Yeah. Maybe we ought to get back. Good morning. Good morning. I... I thought I'd see if I could, I don't know, maybe give you a hand. You ever mend a fence? No. Here, grab this. Get your hands dirty, get your mind off things. That sounds good to me. All right, bring her down, that's it. That's got it. Is that it? Yeah, here. I'll take north, you take south. All right. Hook 'er up. I was in New York once. That's my town. Yeah, I didn't like it much. How long you been single? You know, a while. Yeah, that long? Well, I just always figured I'd do better by myself. Well, it's safer, that's for sure. Can't get thrown. Grab that. Yeah, something like that. I was the same way once. You win a few buckles, the girls start showing up. I thought that was as good as it gets. Then I met Heather's mom, and all that changed. How long were you guys married? 40 years, all of them good. Wow. Yup. And then Heather moved back home after her mother passed. Didn't want to leave me alone. I worry about her out here, though. Seems like she can take care of herself. Yeah, she can ride, rope, fix the truck, whip up a meal that'll knock your socks off. Nothing she can't do except let down her guard. So, what do you think? About what? My daughter. Well, she's... she's pretty smart. She's quick, not hard to look at... So you think she's a catch? Yeah. For-for someone. Am I making you uncomfortable? Like a saddle full of nails. You should use that in one of your movies. I did. Twice. So, what do you know about big-screen TVs? Well, big-screen TVs, that is an area where I am the expert. I figured we'd hit on one eventually. You're going to get a big screen? I've been thinking about it. Don't say anything to Heather. 32? 40-inch? I was thinking 50. Wow, are you ready to see those old Westerns in Hi-Def? What's Hi-Def? You missed it. Your father's been dispensing some wisdom. Well, when a cowboy gets too old to set a bad example, he offers good advice. See you, kids. Have fun. You remember Buttercup. Vividly. She would like to apologize. No really, that's... That's not necessary. Okay, thanks. Thanks... I think. Just so you know, when you climb on a horse, you want to grab the reins, not just the saddle horn. Yeah, and you tell me this why? Because then your horse knows you're boss, and what, you want to be a virtual cowboy or a real one? It'd take a few more days than you have. God made the world in six. Yeah, he had more to work with. You got off to a bad start. You never had something bad end up in something good? No, never. Not-not once. All right, well then, hop over. Come on. Get over here. Come on, climb over the fence. Yeah, that's it Yeah, see, you got the hang of it. There, see? Yes, I can climb. All right, so, just so we're straight, this is the front of the horse, that is the back of the horse. Well, I know about the back. Yes, you do. Now, grab the reins, hop on. These? Put your... Yeah. Yeah, put your left foot in that stirrup. This I got. That's right, and make sure you grab the saddle horn. One, two, three.... swing up. Swing your leg up, there you go. All right, grab that other stirrup. Yeah. Okay, now... give him a little squeeze with your knees. For what? To send him forward. All right? Just a little squeeze. All right. Just a little bit. There you go. Ha ha. When in doubt, you let your horse do the thinking, okay? Yeah, I have no choice. You want to go a little faster, you give him another little squeeze. Yeah, what if I want to go slower? You go any slower, you won't be moving. That's not so bad. All right, there you go, good luck. Don't let it... don't let it go. Yeah, you're a natural. I... Hold up, wait. Hey, hey! It's not stopping. It's... Buttercup will be a good girl. Wait, hey... Wait, wait, I lost the rope. You all right there? I'm better now. You got it? All right. Okay. All right, I'm coming. There you go, you're getting the hang of it. Yeah. Okay. Now, turn her around, go to your left. Just take your reins, put them in one hand. Yeah, one hand. Now you're going in a circle, okay. There you go. Send her forward a little bit... Where are you? I'm right here to your left. There! Keep your center of gravity here, point your sternum up to the sky, roll your shoulders back, just relax your body. Sure... I gotta say, this place does have a certain charm. In an unpopulated, desolate sort of way. Check this. You learn that on the Internet? No way. Public pool in Queens. That's how I got this scar. One ricocheted, broke the tile. Okay, you call that a scar? This is a scar. Branding iron. All right. Espresso-maker exploded. Long-horned steer. Dog bite. What kind of dog? Pomeranian. Those are, like, two pounds. Yeah, two pounds of terror. Is that why you're afraid of animals? No, I'm not afraid of them, I've just never really been around them very much. You never had a pet? No, that would require a commitment. You know, when you grow up by yourself, you just take care of yourself. Sounds kind of lonely. I don't see you with a prom date. I'm taking a break at the moment. How long of a break are you taking? Let's just say there's... nothing like the scar from a broken heart. Cowboy? Wall-Streeter. Met in college, got married, got unmarried. I thought we wanted the same thing, but turns out he cared more about his career than family. My Mom fell ill, he took a job back east, and I came home and never went back. So he was a city-slicker and a jerk. Afraid so. Wow, that's a toxic combination. You know, I can kind of see why you don't really like me. You're not a jerk, and I never said I didn't like you, I said you were a fraud. So what, you do like me? How's your head? Still attached. All right, I'll race you back. Race? Wait a minute, I don't even... Let's go. Get. - Morning. - Morning. I'm surprised to see you awake. Surprised to be awake. Well, I had an opening, I thought I'd check in with you. Yeah? What, did you have a rooster cancel on you? The bump on your head's subsided. Any dizziness, memory, vision problems? No, I actually feel better than I have in a long time. This place will do that to you. I've stayed in the cabin a couple times myself. Fond memories. Okay. That's that. What's that? You are free to fly. It's only been two days. - Correct. - But you said a week. Well, over-cautious on my part. But you've healed nicely. So I can get on a plane? Fly away. You are free to move around the cabin. Great. I thought you'd be more pleased, since, you know, you were so eager to get out of here. Yeah, right. So, what do I owe you? - Nothing. - You're sure? Yeah. The Twains are friends. Although... I wouldn't say no to an autograph. Not a problem. Who do I make this out to? - Francis. - Francis. Is that your wife? Daughter? No, that's me. Frank is short for Francis. Sorry about that. - You and me both. - There you go. Thank you. Hey, doc, um... We have doctor-patient confidentially, right? You do recall I'm a vet? The thing is... I'd like to stay here another day, maybe two. - Because it's so peaceful? - Exactly. You know, you're not the first guest to fall for Heather Twain. Don't worry about it. I won't say anything. Just don't go breaking her heart? Absolutely, yes. That sounds perfect. I will hold two rooms for you. Okay. Thank you. Bye-bye. Hey. Howdy, ma'am. Is that blueberry pie? Your favorite, right? Yeah, but how'd you know? You ate it in your movies. I figured at least that part was real. Wow, this is good! I wanted to thank you. For what? Well, we booked out opening week, and two weeks in May. Apparently, your stunt ride put us back on the map. I can make a fool out of myself any time. If it helps, I'll do it again. I'm sure it's bound to happen. You're stuck here for the rest of the week, right? Right. Right, well, I guess we'll just suffer through it, then. You know, I was thinking, as long as I'm here, I should help out. Yeah? With what? Ranch stuff. - You ever chop wood? - I've chopped a salad. Mend a fence? One of my characters did once. It was good. I was a fence-mender. Mr. Ford! Um, that picture of you on Instagram, it got me, like, 9,000 followers. 9,000? All right, let's see if we can go for 10. There you go. Great. Thank you very much. No sweat. Hey... You two are just joined at the hip, aren't you? - Yeah. - No. These are beautiful. Where should I put them? Wheelbarrows? End of the aisle? Here, for the last batch. Thanks. Listen, I'm just gonna go out on a limb here and say that there's something going on between you two. Well, don't go too far out on that limb, it might break off. Okay, he's not as bad as I thought. You didn't have to buy that. You don't even own a horse. Well, not yet, but I do have a couch, and this would look great on that. You hear that? That sounds like a party. You might want to steer clear of that. No... this is what I do. Welcome to our 14th annual Chili Cook-off. We got the usual suspects this year. I'm open to a bribe... And what do we got over here? Better keep the fire extinguisher handy on that one. It's gonna be a good one this year, folks. I'm looking forward to it. Is that Avery under that hat? What's left of me, yeah. Looks like we have ourselves a celebrity judge. Avery Ford! Here you go, you're going to need this. I hope you like chili. That's good. Yeah. That's good, too. Okay, that's got a little kick to it. That's spicy, wow. Sweet and sassy. No, that's not very good. No, I'm kidding, that is fabulous! Avery, you're about to make one friend and five enemies. I don't know if you could tell, but when I first got here, I wasn't really at home. I know that horse could tell. So I'd like to thank you for the honor of allowing me to judge some of the best dang chili that I ever 'et. It's been a tough choice, but the winner is... bowl number three. I did it! Sorry. I just got your messages. Well, it's been a week. When are you coming back? I need more time. For what? Well, I'm riding a horse now. For real. Congratulations. You can tell it to the studio, 'cause we're meeting with them tomorrow night. I just can't come back now. You know how hard it was for me to get this meeting, right, Avery? I mean, your career's not exactly on fire right now. Candace. I gotta go. Where could you possibly have to go? I gotta see a man about a TV. Av... Avery? Avery? H'yah! Look at that. We can't accept this. Yes, we can. I'm happy to do it. I got a great deal on it. I got a cousin, you know... Get out of the canyon. I love this scene. Nobody rides a horse like the Duke. You see that move? Yeah, that was pretty sweet. I'm going to go check on Curly. I think I'll go with you. You and I should have a little chat first. Dad... He'll catch up. Sit. You still have a lot to learn, son, and I'm not talking about ranching. Well, what are you talking about? - My daughter. - Did I do something wrong? Not yet, but I've seen the way you two look at each other. I know she's a grown-up, but I don't want Heather thinking one thing when it's another. I-I don't either. So we're on the same page? I will be a perfect gentleman. Anyone can be a gentleman. Don't tell her anything you don't mean. Be a cowboy. How bad? I haven't been given the talk by a girl's dad since high school. He's been giving that talk since I was in high school. Yeah, he just wants to look after you. I can handle myself. Yeah, I have no doubt. Did you know, "In the bonny bells of Heather, "They brewed a drink long-syne, "'Twas sweeter far than honey, stronger far than wine." Robert Louis Stevenson. I was trying to impress you. You did. My Dad named me after that poem. Who named you Avery? I did. Yeah, the sisters named me Timothy Vincent after the saint. I never really felt like one. Avery was the town I was born in. And Ford? A broken-down Ford Galaxie. Yeah, the Reverend Mother, she would drive us to birthdays, and I would sit in the back seat. Back there, I always thought I would get my own car someday. Drive, see all the stuff I would want to see. But you never learned to drive? Nope. You know what I think we should do? I got some ideas. Meet me behind the barn. I like the sound of that. What...? When you said, "Behind the barn," this wasn't exactly what I was thinking about. Hop on, you're driving. It's been a while since I drove one of these. It's a piece of cake. Plus, there's nothing for you to crash into. Trees, fences. All right, brake's on your right, clutch is on your left, this is your gas, okay? Yeah, I play video games, I got this. Okay, well then, I'm in good hands. I could get used to this. Might have a problem parking in Manhattan. This is nice. Yeah, it is. Whoa, bit bumpy. You did that on purpose. I am so sorry, sweet Sarah. All I ever wanted was a wife, and a family, some sons. See you. I'm getting in over my head here. No, you're right. I should tell her how I feel. Curly, girl, no. No, we're not going to do this now, are we? I've got to get some help. This is happening right now. Is this happening now? Okay... Hey. Why didn't you get me? Well, there's a bit of a time crunch. Plus, we did okay. We had it under control. Congratulations. Thank you. I was talking to Curly. But I am impressed. Mozart? Yeah. It's good for spatial development, you know, according to Siri. Siri does realize they're pigs? Curly and I, yeah, we're picking out names. See that studly one on the right there? That's Avery, yep... and that's his sister. Her name's Maybeth. I'll bring a box and we'll move them to the barn. No, no, no, not to the barn. That would be like a downgrade. Want to share your room with pigs? Yeah, I think I do. He makes a good midwife. In fact, he seems right at home here. You seem pretty happy yourself these days. Well, we booked up half April and May. Well, that is good news. The ranch is back on the map, and so is Dad. People are remembering him. And so they should... but I was thinking of something else. Well, whatever you were thinking, don't. He'll be gone in a few days, and that'll be that. Sweetheart, if he wanted to leave, he'd be long gone already. What do you mean? Well... doctor-patient confidentiality. I told him he could fly out of here days ago. What? His head's fine. It's his heart that's been affected... and maybe yours, too? I know I said it's better to be safe than sorry, but there is such a thing as being too safe. "Hay!" Big bales of it. You know, you don't have to do all that work. I know, but... I want to. You ever slept outside, under the stars? I... spent the night on a fire escape once. 'Course, that was my doorman's fault. You have a doorman? Yeah, Fred. He's indispensable. So... you'd have to open your own doors. And close them, too. Well, how about tonight? Yeah. I think I see why it is you're going to miss this place so much. That doesn't sound like a guy with mechanical crickets. It's not. I think I get it now. I believe you do. And since I am the reason that you're so booked up, I figure I should probably stick around, you know, help you guys out, deliver some more livestock. Well, we do have a foal due in winter. You inviting me to stay the winter? I don't know if we'll still be here in winter. Well, then I guess I should do this now. Hello! What are you wearing? Nuh-nuh-nuh-nuh... What are you doing here? I'm taking you home, since you seem to have forgotten where that is. This is Heather Twain. Heather, this is... Candace. She's my manager. Well... we're a little more than that, aren't we, Avery? No. Nice to meet you. We spoke on the phone. Yes, when you told me that him coming here was going to be good for his career. Candace... You have to admit, this little excursion hasn't exactly been helpful. I disagree. I'll be in the kitchen if you need anything. I'd love a Pellegrino water... flat. We have fresh water. It's from the lake. I'll see what I can do. "We?" Don't tell me you're actually taking this cowboy thing seriously. What if I am? Then put it in your next role... and there will be one. I met with the studio. When? Yesterday. They've agreed to overlook the little horse fiasco thing in exchange for the next three installments of "Aim To Please." Installments? That's what they're calling sequels now? They're going to be exclusively released online, and your fee will be considerably less, as mine, but if this thing takes off, we'll just renegotiate. Yeah. Thank you? Well, I thought you'd be more excited. Yeah, me too. Look, I can tell that you are going through something, but it'll pass, it always does. Let's just get you back into your clothes and get you out of here. I booked us a hotel in Billings. Nonsense. You'll stay here. That would be very kind, Mr. Twain, but we fly out in the morning, and we have meetings all day tomorrow. You'll stay here. I insist... and it isn't kind. I need Avery to finish mucking out his stalls. I'll get my pitchfork. You do lunch late out here. This is dinner. It's 4:30. Well, we've been up since dawn. Why? How long have you two worked together, Candy? Candace. Um, going on seven years. In fact, I think I'm the longest relationship Avery's ever had. Seven years... that's about when his movies started going south. No offense, Avery. None taken. In fact, some would say "south" is generous. Well, that is all about to change with Aim To Please 6, 7 and 8. I look forward to that. Looks like we're going to have to get Wi-Fi after all. Tell you what... I'm ready for some of that pie. You read my mind. - Yeah. - There you go. Pie? I'll pass. You sure? It's better than yesterday! You had three pieces of that. Blueberry is the new black... berry. Hey, y'all. How's everyone doing? Hey, Derek. Hey there. How are you? You ready, Mr. Ford? - Sure. - Ready for what? I'm going to give an exclusive to the Elkhorn Press. - What's that? - My high school paper. Don't worry, he's in good hands, ma'am. Derek, have a seat. Would you like some pie? Yeah. Thanks, Heather. Is it okay if I record this, Mr. Ford? Sure. Probably the best way to make sure you don't misquote me. Great. Well, where should we start? First, I'd like to clear up a few things for my fans. Avery, I... don't think that this is the place. No, this is the perfect place. See, the thing is... for years now, I've been making my living pretending to be something that I didn't know anything about. The fact is, until just about a week ago, I didn't know what a real cowboy was. Your extra pillows. Thank you. Don't all these pillows hurt your neck? No more than that bed will. I think you'll find it's pretty comfortable. Well, I can put up with anything for one night. Likewise. Can I give you a piece of advice? Sure. Don't get too attached to him. He has a big life. He'll go on location, he'll film a movie, and he'll forget all about you. I don't believe that. I know who he is in the real world. This is the real world. Not his. Maybe he's changed. Honey, he's an actor. He made people believe he wore spurs and boots for 20 years. I'm certain he can make a sweet girl like you believe he's falling in love. I'm sorry, but it's better that you hear it from me now, than him later. But I'll get him to send you a signed photograph from set. Stylist at 3:00, Barnes and Noble at 5:00, cocktails at 7:00... Just impossible. What? In Amarillo, '71, this bronc hadn't been covered by anybody all year, then he meets Casey Twain. Have you been listening to anything I've been saying? I heard the word "barn." Barnes and Noble. Is this research, or is this a mid-life crisis? I feel good here. I can't explain it, but... when I'm here, I feel like I'm home. Home on the range? Look, I get it. Annie Oakley here's your new muse. Whatever feelings you think you're having, they'll evaporate. I mean, I should know. You used to have feelings for me once. Yeah, this isn't that. 'Cause you're on the ranch? Last time, you were in the mountains. This is what you do, Avery. You meet somebody when you're on location, and then you go home. Okay, this is not a "location." Heather! Hey! Wait! Look, that was her talking, not me. So none of what she said is true? Some of it is. This isn't that. You've known me a week. And sometimes, a week can be more than seven days. And sometimes, it's just a week. It's beautiful. Honey... come here. We need to talk. About what? Your mother and I had 40 great years together. Those memories are enough to carry me through. I don't need you giving up your life to look after me. I haven't given up anything. I know your first marriage was a bust, but that doesn't mean you don't get back on the horse. Not the horse analogy again, Dad. Remember when you brought Buttercup home? You two hated each other at first, but it wasn't long before you were inseparable. Buttercup didn't have complications. Candace isn't a complication. He's not looking at her, he's looking at you. He's going home with her. Not if you ask him to stay. He's a city slicker, Dad, not a cowboy. You sure about that? Heather? Is that you? Yah! Yah! Yah! Ha! - Hey! - You stay out of this. Little late for that. Dad! The horses are gone! Guthrie. I never should've let him set foot on this ranch. The gates. Got to open this one. Well, I'll be. If that ain't a cowboy, I don't know what is. Whoa... Your first round-up. Proud of you, son. Aw, it wasn't much. Horses like hazelnuts. I'm going to go pay Guthrie a visit. Dad... No, I've been sitting on the fence too long. Time I kicked up a little dust. Thank you. I didn't mean for you to get drawn into this. Nah... it's kind of nice to have something to fight for. I guess you'd better go get your stuff. It's time for me to go. You guys take care of each other, okay? I want to thank you for everything you taught me. I learned a little something myself. You know, you're welcome in New York any time... Ain't gonna happen, son... but thanks for the offer. Avery! We're going to miss the flight. Give me a minute. Look, I... I don't want it to end like this. Well, I guess not all stories have a happy ending. Well, mine do. And I look forward to downloading them. So that's it? Going to leave it unsaid? We're from different worlds, Avery. It's just best that you go back to yours. Okay. If that's what you really want... I aim to please. Hello? Yeah, I'll be there. Siri, what's the weather outside? Hi, I'm Avery Ford. If you love the West the way I do... Tilt the hat up. We need to see your eyes. Bloodshot again. Great. Eye drops? Anyone? Thanks. All right. I'm ready. Let's go again. Hi. I'm Avery Ford. If you love the West the way I do, you'll look forward to the next two installments... - Three. - What? It's three new installments. God, I hate that word. Just... start over. I'm Avery Ford... and if you love the West the way that I do... I do love the West. This is not it. A hazelnut latte, okay, for Avery, right away. No. No. I don't want hazelnut. I don't want Aim To Please 6. My heart is not in this anymore. Avery! This franchise is the reason that you are you, all right? Without it, it's over. So... start again. Start again. Hi. I'm Avery Ford. You love the West the way that I do? You will not want to miss the next three installments of Aim to Please. Bye, y'all! Thank you for everything! Thank you! Thank you! Well, that's the end of the season. It's been a good one. Still not good enough to pay off our loan. That's life, honey. Things move on. We're going to miss this place. What's he doing here? I thought I set him straight. You'd better drive off while you still can. I just came to apologize, sir. Save it for the next person whose land you try to ruin. There won't be a next person. I quit. I went over to J Bar Ranch, and I saw the construction crew clearing the land, and all I could see were the old days, playing baseball with you and the old gang in that field, that time that you got run off by that steer. Suddenly, you're nostalgic? I became someone else, Heather, someone willing to sell out his neighbors. I know I've worn out my welcome here, and... I regret that. Just wanted you to know. Guthrie? Come on, kiddo. Charlie! How you doing? Yeah, looking good. Howdy, Fred. Howdy, Mr. Ford. Action! And cut! Genius job, Avery. Let's bring in Danny the stuntman. I got this, Ira. You sure? You keep them cameras rolling. And action! - Go, Avery! - Yeah, good job! - Did you see it? - I did. And? You know I hate the idea of being wrong, so this kills me to say, but... it's the best thing you've ever done. It was real, Avery. It was... Thanks. Yeah, I mean, the studio's ecstatic. They're already talking about 8, 9, and 10. Yeah, let's... quit while we're ahead. We had a good run. 'Kay. Good luck. I hope you find what you're looking for. Yeah. Me too. Tyler Mahoney! You know I'm half in love with you, right? Hee hee! Yeah! Hey, Curly! You lose a few? Avery... What are you doing here? I need a room. I'm afraid you're a little late. We're closed up. He didn't tell you? Been waiting for you. What took you so long? Well, I got lost a couple of times. My phone went dead, and my truck has no navigation. Wait, you guys have been talking? Emailing, actually. The ranch is ours, honey. Free and clear. Some city-slicker paid off our loan. We can't let you do that. One condition, though. I want my cabin back. I don't know what to say! Well, that'll do for starters. Tofu burgers. I'll throw 'em on the grill. You in? All in. An old cowboy once told me... don't say anything you don't mean. You and me are from two different worlds. I know that. But I could love you... if you let me. How long you plan on staying? Let's see where this trail goes.
