(SPEAKING SPANISH) (CLATTERING) Oops! Hello. (BEEPING) (UPBEAT ROCK MUSIC PLAYING) Hey, promotion girl. Good morning. (BOTH CHUCKLING) I wanna hear all about that meeting yesterday. Mmm? London? I know! So exciting! Can you believe it? (COMPUTER BEEPS) (BEEPS) (BOTH SPEAKING SPANISH) So we can export to the United States. My company sells... (CLICKING) (SPEAKING SPANISH) Yeah, I knew you'd ask for that, but we don't use a financial institution so much in my line of work. What is it that you do? I'm in the music business. Do you have any proof of residence? Well, my rent contract is right there. Okay, that will do. But this needs to be notarized. ALEJANDRO: Well, the thing is my friend owns the place, so we didn't need anything too official. I also included, uh, bills as proof of residence. These are not under your name. Well, I just moved, so I'm changing them. Yeah. (CLEARS THROAT) Do you own any properties in Mexico? Properties? House, apartment. Hmm, would I be renting Jenaro's crappy place if I owned a house? (CHUCKLING) Any proof of income? Well, I recorded this CD, uh, like a year ago. It still sells in some markets. Here you have some pictures of me and my band, of my performances. We did over 200. Okay, I know I don't have a bank account or owned properties in Mexico, but I really need my daughter... Sir, in order to qualify for a US visa, you must provide proof of your ties to Mexico. Ties to Mexico? Proof of financial interest, assets and family links to your country. (STAMMERING) Well, I have all my people here. I have a job. I'm not rich, but I get by. And, uh... And I really need the visa... Sir, without the proper documents... Whoa, whoa. Are you telling me that my daughter won't see her grandparents because I don't own properties? Can you please at least look at me? I'm sorry. All right. Thank you very much. (SPEAKING SPANISH) (CANICAS SPEAKING SPANISH) (SIGHS) Good morning, mamita. You give my visa, please? (BOTH SPEAKING SPANISH) What? Oh, we Mexican... Mexican band. Numero uno? Very fun. Hot man. (GIGGLING) Very hot. Cool. Just check the brochure, maybe you wanna come. Definitely. Bye. All right, thanks. (SPEAKING SPANISH) Rach, hey. How's your day? More yeas than nays? Nays. I'll never get used to it. (SCOFFS) What? London, hello? It's our last chance to go loco with the locals! No. Just don't tell Art. Whoa! Here comes trouble! What's going on, ladies? Hi, Art. Hmm, I can see you, Carol. I can see you. Can I talk to you for a second, Rach? Of course. Come on in. Well, are you excited about London? Yes. It is a great opportunity, Art. I don't know how to thank you. You don't have to thank anyone, 'cause you earned it. I just told them what I saw and they want you over there. So... When are they expecting you? The 21st. My mom's gonna freak. Yeah, she probably is, but she has to understand you're like your old man. We're vagabonds. We're gypsies. And you hit the ground running, kid. Just like your dad. He'd be very proud of you. You know that, right? It's funny. When I was growing up and you guys were traveling all over the world, I swore to myself I would never do the same. (CHUCKLING) And now look at me. (CHUCKLING) This is your life. You know, you do get to meet a lot of people. But you don't really get to know many. I know. Okay, then. Okay. All right, well, I got one more assignment for you. Okay. You know I got that bilateral summit on Monday. Yes. You know how sensitive that thing is? Yes. (CHUCKLING) And before that, I gotta run up to Monterrey tomorrow for that IC conference. And IT took my laptop, 'cause they wanna put some antiviral super stuff on it. (CHUCKLING) And so I need you to pick it up for me and keep it safe until I get back. Okay, no problem. All right, then. Well... Okay. Oh, before I forget. This is a gift from the US State Department. Congratulations on your promotion, Ms. Simmons. Wow. I set it to London time. Thank you, Art. You better get out of here. You better go pack. Okay. All right! Whoo! Thank you. I really appreciate it, Art. Yes. Oh, okay. Thank you. All right, thank you. Bye. Bye now. (ALEJANDRO SPEAKING SPANISH) (CHUCKLING) (SPEAKING SPANISH) (HONKING) (YELLING) (CELL PHONE RINGING) Yes. Yes, yes. One moment. (SPEAKING SPANISH) Yeah, this is Alejandro Fernandez. No, another Alejandro Fernandez. It doesn't matter. Yeah, at what time is the event? I know the place. Okay, we'll be there. Thank you. (BEEPS) (SPEAKING SPANISH) Right, okay. Keep it close and where you can see it at all times. I'll be there in 20. Thank you. (GASPING) Mom! (CHUCKLING) What are you doing here? Oh, so that's how you say hello to your mother whom you haven't seen in six months? No, I mean... Why didn't you tell me you were coming? I don't have any... So, what's all this about going to London? London? How did you, uh, find out about London? Art told me. Of course, I practically had to grill him for it. God forbid you should tell me anything. Why is Art telling you about my life? Because he knows I worry about you. Besides, he's almost family. Look what I got you. Just the way you like it. Arby's large roast beef, no onions. (CHUCKLING) You actually smuggled fast food into Mexico? That's how much I love you. Also, I know how much you've been missing home. And I've been thinking this might be a really good time for you to come home and start your master's at Michigan State. Mom, I'm being transferred to London. Remember? You found out through your enhanced interrogation techniques. Honey. (SIGHS) You've had your fun. Fun? Now, you've gotta come home. Mom! Fun? I have been working my ass off the past two years! Okay? This is not vacation for me. I work for the government, I take my job very seriously. You know, a lot of people who take their jobs very seriously come home. Well, with the exception of your father, of course. I'm not having this conversation right now, okay? Please, make yourself at home. Feel free. I have something very important to pick up... Now, that's a laugh! I will see you later. I love you. I love you, too. (SPEAKING SPANISH) (CHUCKLING) (SPEAKING SPANISH) (INHALES SHARPLY) (STRUMMING GUITAR) (CHUCKLING) (CHUCKLING) Can we please get one drink? One? I can't, I told you. My mom decided to do one of her surprise visits. Again. And I have Art's computer. Just one. I'm your best friend. Who knows when you'll ever see me again? (SCOFFS) You're going so far away! Please? (ZIPPING BAG) Just one. One. I mean it. One. (speaking spanish) CROWD: Surprise! (SPEAKING SPANISH) (MARIACHI MUSIC PLAYING) This is not gonna be one drink, is it? You really didn't think you were gonna leave here without a proper party? Oh, my God. (SPEAKING SPANISH) We're doing shots. We're not doing shots. I told you I can't do a shot. Why? My mom is waiting. I'm not doing a shot. Which is why you need one. (SINGING IN SPANISH) Here's to the Queen, to James Bond... And to David... James Bond? Yes! And to David Beckham's butt! Go!

Where do you live? I don't live anywhere. I'm a gypsy. (SPEAKING SPANISH) Uh... (CLEARS THROAT) I'm gonna check in your bag to see if you have some kind of ID with your address. You don't mind, right? To check your address. (SPEAKING SPANISH) (CHUCKLING) (SPEAKING SPANISH) (BOTH SCREAMING) RACHEL: (GASPING) What? (SPEAKING SPANISH) What? What? Am I being kidnapped? What? I am a US citizen! I am a US citizen! Yes, yes, we know! Okay? Take it easy! Relax! You don't remember? You were sleeping on the street. I had to bring you here. You were dead drunk. What? Why? Because you like to drink. No... I don't drink. Oh. Oh, my God! (SPEAKING SPANISH) (GASPING) Oh, my God! Shit! (EXHALES) I've seen you before. Oh, oh, now you remember. Last night... The mariachi. Oh, my God! (EXHALING) Um, you have a, um... You have a sticker. What? In your hair. Like this one. Yeah. (GASPS) Ah! Jesus! (GASPING) Oh, my God. My laptop. What? My computer. My computer!

(SPEAKING SPANISH) No, no! You... You were there last night! Did you see me leave with a thing? A black computer? Negro computer? (SPEAKING SPANISH) It's a Mac! It was a Mac! Oh. (SPEAKING SPANISH) (GROANING) Oh, my God. Oh, my God, he's gonna kill me! No, easy, easy. We're gonna... I'm sure... Oh, shit! (SPEAKING SPANISH) RACHEL: Over here. Can you help me, please? Here. God. Here, your shoes and your... You know what? I'm remembering now, when I found you yesterday, (STAMMERING) you didn't have any case, any briefcase, computer, none whatsoever. I... No. But I can help you find it. Thank you. I'm... I'm okay. I just... I think I'm gonna check back at the bar first. No, no. We're mariachis, we're patrimonio de la humanidad. We're very well-connected people, I mean, if it got stolen, we can help you find it. Right, Canicas? (SNAPPING FINGERS) (SPEAKING SPANISH) Thank you. Sure, sure. I'm just gonna call a cab. No, please! Let us take you home, come on! I mean, you'll be safe. I have a daughter, for God's sake. You'll be safe. We'll give you a lift. (SPEAKING SPANISH) Um... (MUFFLED) Can I use it? Oh, yeah, yeah! Please go, run! Run, go! ALEJANDRO: Go! Uh-huh. (ALEJANDRO EXHALING) (RACHEL RETCHING) (SPEAKING SPANISH) "We give you a leef," o quien sabe que... We'll give you a lift. (SPEAKING SPANISH) (RACHEL RETCHING) Yes, I know, Mom. No, I just lost track of time. And I had to hand in that report. RACHEL: No, Mom, you weren't having a heart attack! You just say that stuff! (SPEAKING SPANISH) I'll be home soon. Mom, I'll be home soon! (SPEAKING SPANISH) RACHEL: No, Mom, you don't have to do that. No, Mom... Hello? RACHEL: Mom! Hello? Is everything okay? (SIGHS) No. Everything's not okay. (SPEAKING SPANISH) Everything will be fine, I'm sure. You just have to, like, uh... (SPEAKING SPANISH) "Decretation." You just need to decret... You just need to be positive, that's it. (CAR HORN HONKING) (SPEAKING SPANISH) Thank you, sir. I appreciate it. Sure. We'll be doing some things around the corner. If you need us... If you need some help, let us know, please. Okay, great. Thank you! All right. (SPEAKING SPANISH) (SCREAMING) Sorry! I'm sorry. (SPEAKING SPANISH) I'm sorry. (SPEAKING SPANISH) (BOTH SPEAKING SPANISH) Oh, my God! Thank you, God! (SPEAKING SPANISH) (SPEAKING SPANISH) (HUMMING FANFARE) Thank you. Ta-da! (SPEAKING SPANISH) No, no, it's not mine. (SPEAKING SPANISH) (SPEAKING SPANISH) (CELL PHONE BEEPS) Sorry, I didn't... It wasn't there. Oh. I think someone from the office took it. Oh, all right. Do you think you could drop me at the embassy? That's a good idea. Yeah, sure. All right, let's go. Thank you very much. (SPEAKING SPANISH) What do you mean you lost it? What do you mean, what do I mean? You know I can't drink. Okay, well, what are we gonna do now? I already went back to the bar and it wasn't there. Do you think someone from the office took it? How? You had that thing strapped on you all night. (SCOFFS) I'm just gonna tell Art. Are you nuts? He had IC files on there. Oh, my God. Okay. (SIGHS) Okay, I'll just follow protocol. The Embassy cannot find out about this. If this leaks... I mean, worst case you just suffer diplomatic ties between the US and Mexico. Good job! It's no big deal. (CHUCKLES) Really? (SCOFFS) I'm sorry. Look, we're gonna find it, okay? I mean, (SIGHING) you always have a plan, right? (SPEAKING SPANISH) I have a plan. I remember yesterday in the taxi you had a briefcase with you. Wait, we took a taxi? Yeah. You have the number? No, I stopped it from the street, in front of the bus stop. But that's not important, the thing is that I can help you find the taxi driver. Really? Yeah, sure. (EXHALES) So this contact of yours, he is with the police? Oh, no, he's my business partner. Yeah, he owns a taxi cab fleet that operates in Mexico. And I'm sure he can find out who the driver was. Cosme? Of all the cabs in Mexico City? Yeah, yeah, because they operate in certain zones of the city and I remember the guy's face. You know? If you'd rather look for him yourself, we can just drop you... We could drop her off, no? No, no. No, it's a good idea. We should go see him. I called him while you were at the embassy, so he's expecting us in two hours. Okay, great. Thank you. Sure. Would you guys mind dropping me off at my place quick, so I can change and talk to my mom? RACHEL: It's close, it's Polanco. No problem. Thank you. Also, I'm sorry for before. (CHUCKLING) I'm sorry. Thank you for doing this. I really appreciate it. Really. Sure. Um... You know, about the computer... Oh, I'm sorry. And when you drop me off, would you mind just staying in the car? I don't... It's just my mom... She's... Please, let me... Thank you. (CLEARS THROAT) Oh! Did you know there's no 911 in this country? Did you know that? I told you where I was, Mom. Working. You reek of booze. Mom, it's the mouthwash at the... Jesus, I'm not 16 anymore! Okay? I don't wanna argue with you here in the doorway! Honey, there's some guy over there with a mustache waving at me. (SPEAKING SPANISH) They gave me a ride. They're with the embassy. Entertainment staff. (HORN HONKING LIKE ROOSTER) (SPEAKING SPANISH) Oh. Nice to meet you, too. Excuse us, please. He's just my friend. He's very enthusiastic. They're gonna give me a ride back to work, so I'm just gonna change and we'll be right back, okay? I know enthusiastic... I... Come on, Mom. Let's go. Thank you! Okay, Rachel, what's going on? Who is that man? No one. He's just helping me. Now, do you see why I want you to come home? Oh, would you stop with the inquisition? Did you spend the night with him? What? No! No. I just don't want you get hurt. You remember how upset you were over that fling you had with Hank? Mom, I dated Hank for three years. I saw how that man looked at you, darling. I'm your mother, I know everything. ALEJANDRO: Oh, by the way, that's a 15-year-old celebration in Mexico. It's very, very big. We call it quinceanera. And it's very big. You see there? (ALEJANDRO SPEAKING SPANISH) (CANICAS SPEAKING SPANISH) (CHUCKLING) (BELL TOLLING) (SPEAKING SPANISH) Cosme will be here any moment. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, well, in Mexico you need to add 15 minutes to any appointment. Why not just say two hours and 15 minutes, then? Because we're optimists. We would like to make it in two hours, so we say it. Like a wish. You don't feel... I know what you need. Let's go. Oh, no, no. I don't eat stuff from the street. It's very good. Oh, it's actually very good. (SPEAKING SPANISH) No, no, no, for me, no. I'm okay. I don't usually... It's the best cure for hangover, trust me. Try it. (SPEAKING SPANISH) Okay. Mmm. How is it? A bottle of water, please. No. This is our Mexican Gatorade. It's amazing. (SPEAKING SPANISH) Rachel, this is Cosme, my partner. (BOTH SPEAKING SPANISH) (BOTH CHUCKLING) Cosme is in the transportation industry. I invested with him. Oh! (SPEAKING SPANISH) A blue Macintosh? Yes! (MOUTHING) Uh... Something bad? (SPEAKING SPANISH) Who's Margarito? What? Who's Margarito? Rachel, there's a network of people here in the city that they buy and sell, uh, lost and found objects. Mmm-hmm, so do they have the computer? Cosme can get us an appointment with this person, and this person can help us find the computer. (SPEAKING SPANISH) RACHEL: Seriously? But that's theft! Yes. So this driver, whomever he may be, should have given the thing back, not sold it. So we should go to the police. (SPEAKING SPANISH) No, we should go to the police! No, police, no, please! ALEJANDRO: Chill, chill. Everybody chill, please. (SIGHS) Yeah, we might, we might go to the police and they'll interview everybody involved. Yeah. Then probably, you know, if we're lucky, after 3 or 5 months we might get your computer back. Yeah. The Mexican police will fix it, I'm sure. So, uh... (SPEAKING SPANISH) She has her own plan, so... No, no, I don't have my own plan. I'm just... I think we should see the Margarito guy. Just to be safe. All right. Well, I have to work in an hour and after that, we can meet Margarito in my office. (SPEAKING SPANISH) Let's finish the tostadas, no? (SPEAKING SPANISH) (PEOPLE CHATTERING) (SPEAKING SPANISH) Rachel? Erika! Oh, my gosh, I didn't know you were here! Art never said anything. How are you? I'm good, and you? I'm very well. Weren't you supposed to be leaving? Paris? London, yeah. I have got to call him, he's going to get so surprised! No, don't call him. He's probably busy at the summit. I don't wanna bother him. I know my boss. Come now. I know my husband. I'm sure he's at the spa getting a facial. He thinks I don't really know what goes on... (SPEAKING SPANISH) (MARIACHI MUSIC PLAYING) (SINGING IN SPANISH) Go, go, go. (SCREAMING) (SPEAKING SPANISH) (SCREAMING) TEEN FAN: Alejandro, I love you! (SPEAKING SPANISH) My fans! Yes. (SPEAKING SPANISH) (CHUCKLING) Wow. Thank you. No. For what? You didn't even ask me for my autograph. (CHUCKLING) No, for saving me back there, at the party. Well, you looked like you needed help with that lady, that's all. Well, if you do find my laptop, then I will definitely need your autograph. Oh, just in case. Oh. (CHUCKLING) Thank you. So, uh, were those really your fans back there or were you guys just trying to impress me? No, my fans... No, back there, my fans? Our fans, yeah. Very fans, very fans. He's, uh, much famous here. Much famous. Like a Justin Bieber Mexican. But older. Yeah, and prettier. But very... You go ask, miss, Alejandro Fernandez. He's Mexico... Much famous here. Okay. Ask, ask for him. Maybe I will. Okay, so now we're gonna go to your office. To meet the Margarito guy. Yeah, Margarito. (MARIACHI MUSIC PLAYING) This is your office? Well, it's a... This is the cuna of the mariachi. Yeah. Come, come. (SPEAKING SPANISH) I'm sorry. Business. You guys do well. Well, we keep busy. (SPEAKING SPANISH) Ah, okay. (SPEAKING SPANISH) (SIGHS) Uh, Rachel. Rachel, it's the corner table. Let's go.

Yes. Why? I've met great people here. Met people... But... But you really know people? (STAMMERS) (SPEAKING SPANISH) And you have to stop running. (SPEAKING SPANISH) Let's go. (SPEAKING SPANISH) Look, I really appreciate all you've done, but I don't know if this is going anywhere. Oh, no, no. We're on the right track. For sure. He gave us the name of a guy that sells electronics that have been lost or... Stolen. You can say it. (BOTH CHUCKLING) Yeah, yeah, well, he's got it and he'll give it to us tomorrow. I'm sure. You honestly think he has it? For sure. The taxi driver gave it to him and he'll give it to us. And besides, what do we have to lose, right? Right. (DOOR UNLOCKING) Mom? Mom! I'm in here, darling. What the hell happened to the furniture? The movers came. Oh, the embassy must have sent them. Good, hopefully I'll have my stuff when I get to London. I called them. I sent your stuff home. What? I tried to tell you, but did you call me? No. Did you answer your phone? No. (SCREAMING) You what? No, no, wait, please, just... Calm down, have a drink. (SOFTLY) Okay. Oh, God.

Ah! He's got it. (GASPS) (SPEAKING SPANISH) So he doesn't have it? (SPEAKING SPANISH) They have to bring it from their warehouse. Well, can we go get it? No! No? No. We can't. Because it's their territory, so let them do their thing. Yeah. (SPEAKING SPANISH) (GASPS) (SNAPS FINGERS) We have to go! We have to go! (SPEAKING SPANISH) (APPLAUSE AND CHEERING) (HORN HONKING LIKE ROOSTER) (TIRES SCREECHING) Excuse me. Did I hear him say that you were the English teacher? Yes. Yes, I am. (SPEAKING SPANISH) Is it north... New England! (SCHOOL PRINCIPAL SPEAKING SPANISH) (PLAYING SLOW TUNE) (SINGING IN SPANISH) (APPLAUSE) (BOTH SPEAKING SPANISH) I'm taking you home. I mean, I'm giving you a lift. Otherwise, we'll hit rush hour, and all the city gets crazy. Yeah. But you love it. Yeah. How about you? Do you love it? Well, I'm leaving for London in two weeks, so... Oh. You know what? I do love it. It's great. It's beautiful. It's... It's fun. The music, the people... Yeah. The food, oh, my God! I was here for two years and I never even... Why? Well... We're gypsies. We pack up and we go. Who's "we"? I. I don't stay for too long anywhere. 'Cause if you stay, it gets complicated. So that's what your dad did? Like sending postcards from wherever he went? Yeah. He was never really around. He died while he was away. And my mom could never really get over it. So, for me, I guess... I guess it's hard for me to connect. To see people. Oh... Oh, that's why. Why what? Well, I... I mean, you do see me. I do see you. And I see what you did back there with Maria. What you two have, I've never had with my dad. Well, I don't think I'm so great for her, anyways, so... (CLEARS THROAT) What? You're like the most amazing guy I've ever met. You're smart, you're funny, you're talented. And you're the best dad. And you saved my life finding my computer. Thanks. We should go.

Please, no, not in this crazy city. Mom, it's magical. Magical for you, maybe. For me? Not so much. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Mom. I should have called. Oh, I'm sorry. I overreacted about the furniture, I... I'm sorry. Honestly, I was at a party and I had a little too much to drink... That we know. But that's not why I'm sorry. (TEARFULLY) I'm sorry because that's what it took for me to see things. See things? Honey, don't get all spiritual on me, 'cause it makes me nervous. You know what, Mom? You've been making me nervous for a long, long time. (SPEAKING SPANISH) (RIPPING) Hey. Hi! You were supposed to pick me up, right? (GIGGLING) I mean, to meet the computer guy. Hi! I'm Carol from the embassy, you remember? We met at her party. She's talked so much about you and I'm finally meeting... And on behalf of the American Embassy, I just wanted to thank you for everything you're doing for her. (SPEAKING SPANISH) You're welcome very much. Yeah, well... A guy... It seems that a guy...

(SPEAKING SPANISH) Wait, I don't understand. So, you just... You don't have the money? No, no. Uh... I do. The thing is that I... It's invested and... And I asked this guy for a loan, and so the money's just not arriving like fast enough, that's the thing. (DRAWS BREATH) Yes. So I'll lend it to you. Wha... No, no, no... Yes. No, Rachel. I can't let you do that, and... And besides, I'm not gonna get you involved in this. Okay, so you're just gonna give up? No! No way! You found my computer in this huge city. Okay? We are not giving up. Okay? So... Let's make the money. How? Well, you guys sell music, right? Yeah, yeah? So let's go sell music! What? Rachel! Oh, my God! That's my girl! Yes! We can help you!

What? Play one of yours. (SPEAKING SPANISH) (STRUMMING GUITAR) (SINGING IN SPANISH) (BLOWS KISS) CANICAS: Oh! Hey, I'm gonna go with them, okay? Okay. (CANICAS SPEAKING SPANISH) CANICAS: You come, me? (LAUGHING) CAROL: Yes. ALEJANDRO: When I was a kid, I used to come here and play hooky. To, you know, write my stuff. It's beautiful. Yeah. I dream of writing songs and, you know, touring the world, get sick of my fame... (BOTH CHUCKLE) So, what happened? Well, my father wanted me to get a diploma, so I went to college. I still managed to sell my songs. I toured the country and I even got a record deal. Wow! Yeah. I was about to make it big, but then... Then Maria's mom died? Yeah. I haven't been able to write since then. I had to concentrate on Maria. On surviving. Tonight, Rachel, with you, for the very first time in a long, long time... You have to translate that song for me. Yeah, I will. Rachel, I need to... (HORN HONKING LIKE ROOSTER) Canicas. (SPEAKING SPANISH) What time is it? Um... Let me check... It's 6:00 already. No, we need to go. Let's go. This is it? Yeah. Let's go. No, no, Rachel. Please. This is a guy you don't wanna meet. Really. Yeah, but if... No, no. Uh, no, just... Trust me, please. (SPEAKING SPANISH) (GENTLY KNOCKS) (WHISTLES) No... No working the business. I'm going. (SPEAKING SPANISH) Rachel, stay in the car, please! Stay in the car! (HAPI SPEAKING SPANISH) I have money. (SPEAKING SPANISH) Go back. Understand, Rachel, please. This is my mess, I need to fix it. Just let me help you. (SPEAKING SPANISH) You gave me my visa, you remember, miss? I told you I will never forget. (SPEAKING SPANISH) You gave a visa to this guy? (SPEAKING SPANISH) Please, just give him his stuff. Guerita, if it were your stuff, you could take them right now. (SPEAKING SPANISH) But on behalf of my girlfriend Yamileth and me, I thank you for that visa. We had an amazing time at Disney! Yamileth love the States! But Mr. Mariachi here owes me money. No, wait! That's your watch! It's for Yamileth. That more than covers what he owes you, right? (SPEAKING SPANISH) No, you can't do that, that's your watch. I don't need the watch anymore, Alejandro. (SPEAKING SPANISH) The time is wrong. It was set for London. (SPEAKING SPANISH) HAPI: Let me tell you something about Yamileth. (SPEAKING SPANISH) Over at Disney, they wanted to hire her as Cinderella. Wow! We were in Tomorrowland. (SPEAKING SPANISH) HAPI: "it's a small world..." (SPEAKING SPANISH) Yamil was dancing, singing, everything! Good, good times. I'm very glad. Rachel, would you please help me with the guitar? Yes, thank you. Hey. (SPEAKING SPANISH) Hey. Bye-bye. (SPEAKING SPANISH) ALEJANDRO: Shh. (SPEAKING SPANISH) (THUDDING) Oh, my God! Where's Maria? With Dona Chelo. Where would you like these? Oh, yeah, please, in my room, please. In my room, like, all the way to the back. Like, really... Yeah, next to the drapes. Okay. All the way the corner. (SPEAKING SPANISH) Can I help you clean? No, no. Actually... About what happened in the park... (SPEAKING SPANISH) Oh, my God, the computer! (SPEAKING SPANISH) Oh, thank you! Oh, my God, they found it! You found it! Yeah. I can't believe it, thank you! (SPEAKING SPANISH) Oh, my God! Oh, my... (SPEAKING SPANISH) Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Uh... I need to tell you something... You know what? I'm happy that I lost it. It's the best thing that's ever happened to me. Because I found you. But, regarding... Rachel... (CLATTERING) (RACHEL LAUGHING) (SPEAKING SPANISH) This is water, right? Yes, it's lemonade. Mmm! Oh, it's good. Thank you. (GIGGLING) So... You have a sticker. In your hair, yeah, like this one. Ah! Jesus! Are you still leaving? I... (STAMMERING) I can explain... I'm very sorry. I'm very, very sorry, Rachel. (WHISPERING) You had it the whole time. Why? Because I needed a visa. What? Uh, you were at the embassy and you didn't listen. You didn't even look at me and... And then you were there, so I thought... You thought what? You thought you could lie to me? You could steal my stuff? No, no, I... (TEARFULLY) You used me. This whole time. For a visa? It's not for me, it's for my daughter, Maria. (BREATHING DEEPLY) She needs to be with her grandparents in Arizona. This environment is not safe for her. I'm not good for her! So you're gonna send her away? So she grows up without a father? No, no, it's not like that... It's... Yeah... I guess I was doing that, and then I lied to you and I used you. (SOBBING) But then, everything changed. With what happened in the park... And then we kissed... Ugh. It was a lie. Everything you did was a lie! No, no, it wasn't. It wasn't and you know it! Rachel... At least look at me. There's nothing to see. I'm not even gonna ask you where you were last night. I was making a big mistake. Oh, God, Rachel, what... It doesn't matter, it's over. Every time I try to get close to somebody, I get hurt. So... I'm done with it. What do you mean? What do you mean, you're done with it? I'm going to London. Okay. I'll tell her that, too. I love you, honey. Bye. Did you go to a birthday party during business hours? (STAMMERING) I was gonna... Ah, I'm kidding! I'm kidding. (LAUGHING) You know, Erika really loves you. Yeah. That means a lot, 'cause she's my favorite wife to date. So that means something. (CHUCKLING) She said you seemed a little stressed out, though. Are you having second thoughts about London? No! No, the sooner I'm there, the better. I mean, we're gypsies, aren't we? And vagabonds. You know, when I was your age, I had to make a big choice. And I'm not complaining, but because of that choice, I've had to make a lot of compromises in my life. And this decision you're making, Rachel, it's a big one. You gotta make sure you follow your heart. Remember what you told me about really getting to know someone? I tried. And... My heart is telling me that London is the right thing to do. Okay, so you tried. You gave it everything you had. Well, that's that then. That's that. Alrighty, there you go. Thank you. Thank you. Oh, by the way, I really appreciate you taking such good care of my laptop. Of course. You know, I didn't know it, but there's a GPS tracking device in these things. And Intel got really nervous, 'cause apparently, this thing was on an incredible journey. So, you know how spies are, they pushed a button and they scrubbed the whole thing, and now it's garbage. (CLEARS THROAT) But not to worry. They got me a new one with all my stuff on it, so everything's fine. (LAUGHS POLITELY) I just hope that that thing and the journey it went on didn't cause you too much trouble. No, no trouble at all. That's great. Yeah. Thanks, Art. Goodbye. Bye. (SINGING IN SPANISH) Hi, Mom. Oh! Sorry I'm late. No, don't think about it. (SIGHS) Well, this is surprising. You wanting to go out in this crazy city. Don't be so ironic. I'm trying to see things your way. You did say you were seeing things, didn't you? No, no, I wasn't. Really, really wasn't. (SIGHS) I wanna eat before you start with let's-go-back-home thing. Actually, I'm the one who's going back home. My plane leaves in the morning. You're okay about me going to London? No, I'm not okay about you going to London. But, you know what? It's none of my business. It's not my problem, it's your problem. I just have to let you go. I gotta let you go play in the traffic and get banged up and bruised and battered like I did, and maybe you'll... Maybe you'll find something that makes you happy. Maybe you won't, but... Speaking of someone who hasn't been happy in a very long while... Mom, you don't... No, no. No, no, no. All I'm trying to say is, if you find something that makes you feel part of life, then go for it. It's just life. Not gonna kill you. That's enough of that. I have to eat something. Okay, what's this? (READING IN SPANISH) Is that Mexican or Swiss? It's Mexican, Mom. (SOFT MUSIC PLAYING) (KNOCKING) (WHISTLES) (SPEAKING SPANISH) (DIALING) Hello, can I have a taxi, please? (HORN HONKING LIKE ROOSTER) (TIRES SCREECHING) (SPEAKING SPANISH) You almost gave me a heart attack. What's with you? (SPEAKING SPANISH) Yeah, but Rachel's leaving tonight. (SPEAKING SPANISH) Alejandro love Rachel, Rachel love Alejandro. (SPEAKING SPANISH) Please, help... (HORN HONKING) (SHOUTING) Dude, what's with you? (SHOUTING IN SPANISH) God! I want to marry me you. Please. Canics, go! (SPEAKING SPANISH) (KNOCKING AT DOOR) (SPEAKING SPANISH) Hi! (SPEAKING SPANISH) Move it, move it! Let's go! Come on! (SPEAKING SPANISH) Look, Mister... Mister... Mr. Mucho Mariachi, Big Mexico, Big Band! Rachel is crazy about you, okay? I've never seen her this happy and I know her. So let's go! (SPEAKING SPANISH) (UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING) (SPEAKING SPANISH) (SHOUTING IN SPANISH) (ENGINE REVVING) (HORNS HONKING) (ALEJANDRO SPEAKING SPANISH) (CANICAS SPEAKING SPANISH) CAROL: Go, Canics, you go! (TIRES SCREECHING) (SPEAKING SPANISH) What do you mean I can't go through with my embassy luggage? (SPEAKING SPANISH) Look, I work for the US Embassy! I work for the US government! (SPEAKING SPANISH) Sir, seriously, you're getting on... (SPEAKING SPANISH) No. (SPEAKING SPANISH) Miss, call Obama. Okay, we need a ticket. We need a ticket, let's go. Seriously, dude! (SPEAKING SPANISH) (BEEPING) Rachel, Rachel! Rachel, please, please! Hold on, please, just... Listen to me for a second, please. What I did was wrong. And you must hate me for it. But I'm not that person. Rachel, I was scared. I have a little girl and I thought I wouldn't be able to protect her. It was a huge mistake to lie to you. And I'm so, so sorry I hurt you. But I'm not sorry for what I did. Because thanks to this lie, I got to know you. I got to see you smile, dance, and turn the world around to help me. And if that's all I will have, it's okay. But maybe... Maybe you can give me one more chance. I can't. (TEARFULLY) I'm sorry. I can't. I'm sorry. (CRYING) (SNIFFLING) Sorry. (CHATTER IN SPANISH) (SPEAKING SPANISH) (ALEJANDRO SPEAKING SPANISH) (DISTANT MARIACHI MUSIC PLAYING) Maria! (SPEAKING SPANISH) (SINGING IN SPANISH) So there's no tostadas in London? (CHUCKLES) No. There's no you in London. (WOMAN SINGING IN SPANISH) (SLOW SONG PLAYING)
