You aren't getting married tomorrow. - No. - Men like curves. - I'm going on a diet. Up. Wow, How many laps did I swim? - Five. Do you want more? - How about two more?

I don't know. - What does she want? - Well, she wants to meet. - So are you gonna go? - Listen, I've downloaded some new app. Look, 20 guys, and all of 'em just complete jerks. This one is a total pervert. Look, Katya. Take a look. So this one has three kids. Oh yeah and this guy, he's already sent me a dick pick. God Katya, this is a disaster with these guys. I wonder if they're nearby though. - Listen, Zhenya, please don't tell Sasha about the pool today. He'll think I'm crazy. - Okay. What's going on with Katya? - Everything's fine, why? - Really? You didn't see her at the pool yesterday. She made a real scene. Started yelling at some strange girl. It's not normal. - Okay, I get it. - Yeah. And how does she look, like she hasn't had enough sleep in weeks? - Is that all? - I'm just worried about her. I've been calling her all day, but she won't answer. How is it between you two? - Zhenya, everything is fine with us. - And what about you? - Zhenya. - What? - We've been through this already? - Sasha, relax. I've invited you only because of Katya. - I see. - Listen, I'm not some unhinged crazy bitch. I'm a normal, independent woman. I understand the situation. - We've tried. - Zhenya, what are you starting? - It didn't work out. You've met Katya and that's that. - Zhenya, please do not tell Katya about us, okay. - Come on, you know that I wasn't gonna tell her. You've decided that everything is in the past with us. - Check, please. Hi. - Hi. - How are you? - Fine. - Your hair smells like biscuits? - What? - Did you cook? - No. - Oh, why don't you have any orders? - No, I don't know why. - What's for dinner? - Lasagna. Do you want me to warm it? - Yeah. I'll be in the shower. Katya, just let me explain. - Get your stuff and get lost. - Katya, you don't understand. - Are you stupid? - Katya. That's why I proposed. - Why don't you erase messages on your phone? - I don't know. I don't know. Katya never looked on my phone before. - What were you born yesterday? You should have erase anything sent to you by another woman. - Look Oleg, I'm not a pro at this, like you are, okay. I didn't expect her to send me anything like that. I was shocked myself. - You should use your head next time. By the way, show me her boobs. - I've erased it. - Erased? Seriously. What kind of a friend are you? Well, let's hope she gets over it soon, huh? - Ah, so tired of her. - Who Zhenya? - Yeah. - Listen, you should be more gentle with her. She is a good girl. She's just still in love with you. Otherwise I'd have already done her. - Zhenya, Zhenya, are you awake? - Yeah, I'm awake. - Okay, listen, I found her. Her name is Maria Lazarenko. There's a whole article about her. - Yeah, so? - Well she's dead. She committed suicide a week ago. Can you imagine? - Wait, are you sure it's the same Maria Lazarenko? - Yes, I compared the picture in the article to her online profile. It's the same. - And? - Well, if she's dead, but she texted Sasha from her account yesterday, right? So who's actually texting Sasha then, right? - Right. - I need to think. When will you be here? - I'm coming, don't worry. - Okay. Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit. Ow. Sasha. Hi. - Hey. - Where are we? - In the hospital. - Where's Zhenya? - Zhenya's here. She went to get some coffee. I found you unconscious at home. Katya, what happened? - I was with Zhenya, on the phone and she was supposed to come over. And then the lights went off in the apartment. And then she came. - Are you okay? - I'm sick. Listen, Maria, your ex. Listen, somebody hacked her account and is now writing to you, pretending to be her. - Get some rest. Zhenya, where are you? - Sasha, what's wrong? - What the fuck are you doing? - What do you mean? - Don't play dumb with me. You're writing me from the dead account of my ex-girlfriend. You cause Katya's nervous breakdown. - You're hurting me. - Hey there, what are you two doing? - You're hurting me. What the hell is wrong with you? Do you really think it was me? - There was nothing between us, understand? - You idiot, she's my friend. - Leave us the fuck alone. - Fuck you and your Katya. - Lady, who's gonna clean that up? Thank you. - Zhenya, Zhenya. - Shut up. Hi Oleg. - Ah, Zhenya. - Listen, I have an offer for you. - What offer? - How about you come over? - Now? - Yes. - Why? - You aren't a baby boy, you know why. - Ah, okay. - Let's go. Bitch, shut up already. I can't prove anything to you idiot because I didn't write anything to you. Stop posting your ex's pictures 'cause she's dead. - Zhenya. Zhenya, why is your door unlocked, huh? Zhenya. Zhenya. - Sasha. - Ah, fuck you. - Hello? - Katya. - Sasha, Sasha, Sasha. - Quiet, quiet. What are you doing here? - We need to leave. We need to leave. - Katya, wait. Katya, wait. Katya, wait. - What? Shit. - Zhenya's dead. - What? Shit. She's killed her. - Who? - Read the article, Maria Lazarenko, shooting at the wedding. - Okay. "The wedding at the Recreation Center turned into a tragedy. "October 11, Maria Lazarenko "came to the wedding of every ex-fiancee Andrei Vorontsov. "She was armed with a gun that belonged to her father, "retired police colonel. "She opened fire on the wedding party, "but most of the attendees were able to escape. "One person was killed, two were shot." - There's also a video. - Right now, we're at the scene of the restaurant shooting. A happy celebration was here one hour ago. But now this place looks more like a battlefield. A strange girl came here with a gun and started a targeted shooting of the groom. After the victim was down, the girl shot herself. Authorities have not released the name of a victim or shooter, as the investigation is still ongoing. - Shit. Pick up the phone. - Oleg? - Don't even think it, he's alive. - Yes, well, let's think about it. Why is she chasing us? - I don't know. - What? She was your ex-girlfriend. - I didn't even date her. I've never seen her before in my life. - What? - Oleg worked as a phone repairman while we were in high school, he stole pictures from one of his clients' phones, she was pretty older than us. - Lazirenko? - Yes. Yes, and I photoshopped myself into the picture with her. - Why though? - I don't know, I just wanted to look cool in front of my friends. - Okay, okay. - It was a stupid mistake, okay. - Okay, okay, I've got it. Just gimme the phone please. Okay. Comments say that she lived somewhere near Dmitrov in Ivantsovo. We need to find her house. - Let's go. - How are we gonna find it? - We'll ask people there. - What are you looking for? - Hello. - Hello. - We were told that the Lazirenco family lives here. - So what? - We're writing an article about your daughter. - I don't talk to the press. - Natalia Sergeevna, we'd like to tell the truth about your daughter. Other media outlets depicted her as a monster. We would like to tell Maria's story and understand what made her do what she did. Maybe we can even exonerate her in front of the public. - Shh, come here. This is for enteral feeding. My husband suffered a stroke some time ago. I feed him still. But it's through a tube now. You can use this picture if you want. - Beautiful. I can't even begin to imagine, how hard it's been. - I'm a doctor. I've seen a lot. But I couldn't have imagined a thing like that. They were gonna get married. My girl and that. - Andrei Vorontsov. - Yes. Seven years ago, October 20th, the wedding was in two days. I've never seen my girl that happy. But then somebody showed him her picture on the internet where she was with some guy. She didn't even know the guy. She'd never seen him. But that jealous bastard didn't believe her. - And then what happened next? - He threw acid in her face. My poor girl. My beauty. Right at her face. She was completely ruined. That bastard. She left Moscow after that and lived here. She didn't see the sunshine. She couldn't look at herself at all. All mirrors were covered in the house. - And what about Vorontsov? - What about him? He did his time and was released. He's found himself on new bride. Maria dreamed so much about the wedding. I've told you everything thing. - Jesus, what the hell have I done? Oh my God, it's all my fault. What should I do? - Well, her mother said that she couldn't look at herself in a mirror. So that means she's afraid of mirrors. - Yeah, that's why she disappeared in the hospital. - Okay, okay, okay. It means that seven years ago, Andrei had found her picture, a fake picture, and it means that everything is because of that picture. It turns out that she's chasing us because of that picture. - What for, revenge? - It seems not. Wait. The wedding, she dreamed about the wedding. - Do I marry her now, Katya? - Oleg. - Hello? - Oh praise God you're alive. - Praise God, I'm alive. - Why the hell didn't you answer your phone? - I was being questioned by the police about Zhenya. I still can't believe it. Where are you? - I'll send you the location. You need to come here now. And this is urgent. You need to buy a mirror. - A mirror. What are you even talking about? - Oleg, get a taxi. I will explain everything to you later. Okay, the nearest shopping mall is five kilometers from here. Two kilometers straight and. - Listen, maybe you should just call the police and tell them the truth. - Yeah and what should we tell them? Oh, officers, a ghost is chasing us. - You sure this wedding ceremony will help? - Oleg. - Get in. Parking fee. - Please hurry up. Oleg, she wants to take Sasha. I think if we make a ceremony, she won't be able to do it. - I told you this wasn't over, buddy. - How am I gonna tell this to my uncle? - You don't need to explain anything to your uncle or to anyone else. - Well, hello there. - What the hell? - So punk, you're not much of a hero without your phone and your girl. - Easy man. Dammit. The mirror, the mirror, hurry. Hurry up, start the car. - No. - But this is a really special occasion Uncle Alexei. - It's perfectly fine that you wish to have a wedding ceremony at the church, but there is no need to invent surreal stories for that. - Uncle Alexei, she's already killed someone. We really need your help. - Oleg, I said no. - But we don't have anywhere else to go. - Jesus Christ. - Uncle Alexei, I know it's hard to believe. - This is preposterous. - But the guys really need your help. - Oleg, no. - Father Alexei there's something. - Oh my God. Our Father who are in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come that will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread and forgive us of our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. Bless us, Lord. Oleg go to the sacristy, bring the crowns and the rings.

Sasha. Sasha. He has a pulse. - Where's the cursed one? - What? Sasha. The ring, she's taken his ring off. Why didn't the wedding work? - I don't, I don't know what to say. The prayer should have scared her off. But maybe she isn't buried. - What do you mean? The article mentioned the funeral. - No, her body is not buried. We need to find her body and pray for her soul. Her soul is in a demon's hands. - This is for our enteral feeding. My husband suffered a stroke some time ago. - The place of God's inhabitant became the repository of an evil spirit. - I know where she is. - We need to find her body and perform the funeral ceremony. Go, I'll be with him. - Sasha. - When you find the body, you need to put this on her forehead. - On the forehead, okay. Well then, thank you. - I will be praying for you. - Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. - He who dwells in the shelter of the most high abides under the shadow of the almighty and says of the Lord, he is my refuge of my fortress, my God in him I will trust. - What do you want? - Natalia Sergeevna. - I'm not giving her to anybody. She's in a coma. - She might be in a coma, but there's something inside her. Your daughter, she kills people. - No, no, my daughter is not a monster, she's a victim. - Help her. Let her go. Let her die. - I'll let you die instead. - Thou shall not be afraid for the terror by night, nor for the air that flies by day. A thousand shall fall by side and 10,000 at thy right side. But it shall not come near thee. - Daughter, what's wrong with you? - She's not your daughter anymore. Tell her to leave us alone. - Sweetheart. Daughter, what are you? - She's not gonna stop. - Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of the wicked.
