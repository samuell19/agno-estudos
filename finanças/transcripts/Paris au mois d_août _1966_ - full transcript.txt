PARIS IN THE MONTH OF AUGUST Simone! Are you both ready? Too late... everyone's left. They were supposed to wait for me. She didn't want to miss the train. Holidays come first! Simone didn't seem very happy. Don't look so disappointed. You'll see your lady again. How long ago did they leave? One cigar. Feel like a drink? No, I want to say goodbye to my wife. What, run to the station in this heat? You can phone her tomorrow. A surprise phone call always goes over well. No. I have things to tell them and the kid forgot this. Hey...! Is Sunday still good? Of course! 8 o'clock at Paul's? No... 6 o'clock at the latest. That's a bit early for a Sunday! Has to be... It's 60 K. But it doesn't need to be 6am! If you're not there, you'll be left behind. Anyway, see you for a drink this evening? Yes! - At Paul's? - Yes! Can't you keep it quiet? Bang! - Hey, wait...! - What? Your wife couldn't wait any longer.. Thanks for telling me. -Train 11711 leaving for Mans, Laval... ...Rennes, Messac... ...Redon, Questembert, Vannes, Auray, Lorient... ...Quimperle, Rosporden, Quimper... ...connecting to Rosporden for Concarneau... ...leaving at 1.05, platform 21. I swing forward... one... Then back... two! And I flip it forward, three! Like in a tango. Same movement, same rhythm, but with more vigour. You've never fished before? Never. You'll soon see what a pleasure it is! Don't you know what time it is? It's the same every day. We don't kick the customers out. Next we'll be pulling them back... No kidding! Customers amuse me. None are the same. I reckon they're mass-produced. Doesn't anything interest you? Yeah, pay-day. I'm not here for the fun of it. You can have fun while you work. Work, for me, is a pain in the arse, and it always has been. That's how I am. When I'm somewhere that bores me, I want to get out fast. Well, I like fishing. By a river... that's nice. Have you ever seen a river at dawn, with the mist hanging over it? Do you know what you are? A wanker. Because I like what I do? Have you got your trifecta for Sunday? - See you tomorrow. - See you. The eggs are in the pantry The butter's in the fridge Don't forget to close the fridge door. The salt is in the cupboard beside the crackers. The frying-pan is under the sink Should you have gone to Paul's? You'll find swimsuits... corsets, ready-made bras at discount prices... - Your trifecta for tomorrow? - 8, 5 and 3. 'William Tell' doesn't rate! Whose tip is that? Nobody's! Simone's birthday's the 8th, mine 5th, wedding day 3rd. - See you Monday! - Till Monday. Come to lunch next Sunday, since you're on your own. OK, I'll think about it. Miss! (English accent) Thank you very much. Hey... that was 8, 5 and 3? - You'll be in on it? - Not with 'William Tell'. But miracles do happen. You said it! Nice bunch of people, eh?! The heat puts them on edge. Those idiots? They behave like pigs, summer or winter! People don't know how to be part of society any more. So there IS no society any more. Only gangs.. Gangs and mobs! No point in letting it get to you. - I brought you back your book. - Like it? Take another one. - You don't mind? - Nothing upsets me... Except other people! Look at that... It's been the same since this morning! A motorised mob, off in search of clean air. A bunch of idiots! Pathetic! All brain-dead! What are we waiting for, to use the atom bomb? Boom! Excuse me... I've lost the Pantheon. The Pantheon? - Is it far? - Far... Depends how much time you've got. Come along here. I'll be back. She's looking for the Pantheon. She's right. Do it in the Pantheon. It's fine there. Nothing but dead people. - See the bridge down there? - Yes. That's the Pont Neuf. Yes, the Pont Neuf. You go across it... On the other side, there's a small square... And past that, another bridge. You cross that, too. Understand? Yes, do the same on the other side. - It goes on. - It goes over another river? No. No, it's still the Seine. Are there two Seines? No. At a certain point the Seine splits into two. Yes, like that. Exactly. Like an embrace. That's nice! I like it. At home, the Thames does not embrace. Of course... it is English. - Why do you say that? - Well... - You're English? - You are not hearing? Good, I cross the Seine, and after? You go to the left, along the... What's the name of that quay...? Take the Rue Dauphine, straight ahead... And then... If you like, I'll give you a sprig of guidance. - What do you mean by a sprig? - A bit. A long way. Like a sprig of lily of the valley. "A sprig of lily of the valley". That's nice. I like it. What that there? That's the French Academy. What's it used for? The great writers are put there. They're locked up? It's not a prison! They can go, go out, come back. I see. There are 40 of them there. The most famous ones like... ...Pagnol, Mauriac, Jean-Paul Sartre, Daninos... I'm not sure about Daninos. But Dorgeles, for sure. And Maupassant? No... Maupassant's dead. Quai des Grands-Augustins! What? The name of the quay I was trying to think of. I'm crossing the Seine! I, Patricia Seagrave, am crossing the Seine. The Seine's beautiful. What's that over there? La Samaritaine. And opposite, la Belle Jardiniere. Two big department stores. We have the same thing in London. Selfridges. It's awful. Awful? Why? Don't you find that the shop assistants all look unhappy? That hadn't struck me. It's a humiliating occupation, no? For a woman... perhaps... But for a man...! - How do you find my accent? - What accent? You don't have any accent. Oh! Frenchmen are such liars! - Maybe I don't have an accent. - No. You have a manner of speaking. It's not the same thing. But if it is an accent, it's very pretty. "Very pretty"? It's not very pretty. It really is. I think you're being too kind. Do you come to Paris often? No, it's the first time. But I've been to France before. - For work? - Yes. I'm the top model at Norman Hartnell... ...the queen's fashion designer. And you go everywhere? Sure! America... Japan... Have you been to Rome? Last month. Odd, you haven't been to Paris. In Paris there's French fashion. Bastard! Lovely... I love it! Bastard! What are you thinking about? How agreeable Paris was, in August. - No! - Oh! Are you superstitious? No, But you never know. You? Yes, but not about ladders. Thanks. I'm a Sagittarian. In England, all Sagittarians are superstitious. What are you? Leo. I mightn't look like a lion, but don't be fooled by appearances. So what's your name? Brutus? My name's Henri. Henri's nice. I like it. And your name? Patricia. Patricia Seagrave. But I don't like it. I'm known as Pat. It's quicker. Pat's funny. Alright, Pat? - Alright, Henri...? - Plantin. - What? - Henri Plantin. Plantin?! You know what that sounds like in English? A banana tree. You're not angry? On the contrary. I have a friend called Chestnut. Anyway, banana trees are beautiful. And what does Seagrave mean? It means Pat! Are you angry, Mr Banana Tree? No, but I don't think I'm doing well with women. But it's just me you're talking to. That's true. There you are... There's your Pantheon. Oh, yeah! Where do you go in? You can't. It's closed at this time. Already? I so much wanted to see Napoleon's tomb. What? Napoleon's not at the Pantheon. He's at the Invalides. Is the Invalides far? No. But it's also closed. I shan't leave Paris without seeing Napoleon. - I promised. - Who? Myself. You're not angry? No, why? You've had to come all this way for nothing. I should've told you before. Oh, I was happy to walk with you. Really. I had nothing else to do. Are you on holiday? No, of course.... You're in Paris. What do you do for a living? You would be amazed. - Guess. - That's hard. No... what do I look like? - Are you an inventor. - No. - You work on the atom bomb? - No. - Racing driver? - No. - Photographer! - Oh... No.... you're a PR man! Banker? Performer? I know... you're an interior decorator. Painter! I say you're a painter. Let me think... Yes, I'm a painter. It's a beautiful profession! You can work when you want to. You're independent. - And if inspiration fails? - You go back to bed. - Are you married? - Why do you ask? An artist? Never! At least, not for now. - Then you know Saint-Germain? - Do you want to go there? Yes, I want to! It's not a place for you. There are drunks and hooligans. I'd love to see hooligans! If you'd read Souriau's 'Film Studies'... ...you would not confuse celluloid reality with screen reality. Before being projected onto the screen... that is, passing from celluloid reality to screen reality... ...the images pass through the lens of the projector. In other words, what we experience is a lenticular reality. Nobody understands Sartre any longer, nobody. Well, maybe Simone de Beauvoir. But I didn't ask her. They still deleted the conclusion of my article. They saw me in the paper! I go home to my place, not to Germaine's. I tell myself "Germaine has gone to Suzanne's". If I was Brigitte Bardot... Just supposing... If I were her, I'd be more intelligent! The rhythm my friend, the rhythm! Even in political economy! She had the nerve to tell me: "I was at Suzanne's." I mean to say! Gide? No idea. Women? Yes, to make love to... But otherwise... You know what...? She was not at Suzanne's. You know Germaine. Censorship has never spawned a creator. What's this? "Beaujolis"? Not "Beaujolis". Beaujolais! Isn't "joli" more jolly? Where are the hooligans? Are those ones the hooligans? You have a crumb here. - Poofs! -Poofs? What's a poof? You don't know? You do have them in England. Explain it to her. A poof is a... A hooligan? Yes, some, but... That's it, a hooligan! Another bottle of the same! More?! Henri, you're terrible. Terrible? Are you a poof, too? No... let me explain... He should have been here at 7 o'clock for the card game. - What's the idiot up to? - His wife's away. - So? - That's all. You know him... He'd never deceive his wife. Exemplary! I don't worry, I'm single. Don't touch that! It's precious stuff. Take a seat... You be 4th hand till he comes. Coming, Paul? Sorry! What's going on? If there's dancing, I'd love to go in. As you wish. Wanna come in? Let's go! I'm not alone. I'm with someone. Henri! Well, how about you...! - Do you think you killed him? - Don't be silly. You scared me! That better? Henri... Are you racist? Me? Yes, you are... I can see it in your eyes. What about my eyes? You're terrible, Henri. I must look awful! You know how to drive? Sure. Do you have a car? I like this... Don't you? Not bad. What are you doing? Henri... Take me to Deauville. But it's not our car! You're not reasonable. You're happy to kill a Negro, but not to steal a little car. Henri... Henri! Not so loud! Would it bother you to go to Deauville? Alright, we won't go to Deauville. Happy now? Take me to Cannes. Are you joking? You know where it is? Yes. Just at the bottom, on the edge. Please get out of the car. We'll go to Cannes afterwards. In my car. Miss, Cannes is a long way away... but we can go somewhere else. Closer. - This is your car? - Yes. Oh no... Please go away! He's a a tough guy! Please don't start anything! Save yourselves quickly! I may be a little drunk. Look how clear the water of the Seine is. I'd like us to go swimming together right now. Wouldn't you like to? You can't go swimming in the middle of the night. But the French take midnight baths. Yes, at Saint-Tropez and Cannes, and so on! If you'd listened to me, we'd be in Cannes now. We'd have to have been driving pretty fast. I'd so much like to swim in the waters of Paris. It'd make a lovely memory. - I love memories. Don't you?? - Yes. But it's forbidden by the police. Do you swim in the Thames? No, but I'm English. The French are always supposed to do things that are forbidden. Well, tonight I'm English! Can you swim? Yes. It's not forbidden to save someone who's drowning. No, that's not forbidden. So, I'll throw myself into the water and cry "Help". You'll save my life, and they'll give you a medal. And I'll get to swim in the Seine. Like to do that? No! You refuse to save my life? What a shame! I'm sorry for you. He can't say we didn't wait. Let's go home to bed. If we're going fishing tomorrow... - Will he turn up? - He wouldn't miss it. It's a bit worrying. If he's not here tomorrow, I'm calling the police. I'll call his wife. - See you. - Goodnight. Henri! Give me a cigarette. I feel good being with you. Me too. You did well to stop me throwing myself into the water. I could have run... to see. To see what? Something else afterwards. You always imagine that there's something else. There's never anything else. Always nothing. Is this the hour of the blues? Civadusse says... "At night, all ideas are Grey". But he sees that as a painter. It's not "blues hour". It's cold, that's all. What are you doing? Be careful! Pat, come down! Pat, come down! Is that it? They say you see your whole life when you're drowning. I don't know if mine would be worth seeing. It been good being with you. I was wanting to see Paris. I'm seeing Paris. It's beautiful. I love it. It's a shame it's not higher. Come back in 2 months. I'm the Statue of Liberty! I light up the world! Long live liberty! Long live Henri Banana Tree! You're going to wake up the American ambassador. Good evening, Mr Ambassador! Sleep well! For you, Henri. A green mouse running in the grass... I catch him by the tail I show it to these gentlemen These gentlemen tell me: "Dip it in the oil Dip it in the water, it will make a snail hot - Another one? - No... - I only know that one. - You're funny. You find me so funny? No, I find you very nice. I feel comfortable with you. You're magnificent! Don't make fun of me. - No! You're... - Magnificently funny! Yes... I adore you. Until tonight! Pat! Get a load of him! He hasn't slept, eh? Three times I rang his doorbell. What a hide! So now you show up? No shame? What've you been up to? Did you get pinched? Are you coming from the lock-up? With a flower? The cops have sure changed. And I who opened an hour earlier, on a Sunday. Not my fault. Something cropped up. - Act of God. - What cropped up? We'd really like to know. Give me a coffee with a small rum... ...in a shot on the side. I can't tell you anything now. It's too early. It's not over. When I do tell you, you'll understand. Paris in August is something else. We just don't realize. Got a croissant? Thanks. Don't worry about me. I don't want to spoil your day. If you want to catch anything, you'd better get going. 60 K... it's not across the road. Give me another coffee. So, you're not coming with us? You tell us we gotta get up at dawn... for nothing? - What a hide! - You're coming with us. I've collected maggots, especially. - You're coming with us. - No! Take my car. I'll pay for the petrol. That's not the point... You're coming with us. Whose idea was it to organise this fishing trip? That gives you certain responsibilities. It was only to please you lot. I've had my share of fishing. I have other ambitions than luring gudgeons. I do like you guys... But the betting, cards, drinking, fishing... It's not a lifestyle one can boast about. And you, Civadusse... as an artist... You should agree. Have you been drinking? I haven't been drinking. I've been walking and thinking. I've found another universe. What's up kiddo? What is it? Ignore him. He has an ideal. An ideal? Better see a doc. He'll fix you up. - You and your jokes. - Calm down! Have a drink. My shout. A drink with you? You nuts?? Can't you see we've been changed? Drinking, cards and betting are over. The fun of life is dead. I know... you're seeing someone. I'm not leaving without seeing Napoleon. I promised myself. I can see you didn't go to bed. You're asleep on your feet. Romantic walks in the French style, don't agree with you. Working on Sunday is no fun. Neither is working with you. ...in the Emperor's Room in coronation uniform. That work is by the sculptor Chinard. It's of white and gold marble. Very funny. What's your painter's name? Henri Plantin. Henri Plantin? Never heard the name. Don't talk about yourself too much in Paris. They'll think you're a Hick. - A what? - A Hick. ...to the left and right... ...are engraved in gold letters, the works illustrated on the Arc de Triomphe. We still have time for an orange juice? A hot chocolate, please. When you're working, you should get to bed early. - At 2am, you weren't back yet. - Are you spying on me? My private life is my own. You have to be at my disposal at any time, day or night. He phoned me this morning. - Who? - William. I've already asked you to not mention him to me. The proclamation of the Concordat... ...which is represented here by two young women shaking hands... France on the left of the Emperor Rome on his right. Behind Rome, a young woman and an old man say their simple prayers. On the left of France... Have dinner with me? No, I'm too tired. You're dining with me, this evening. Is that an order? It's an invitation to be obeyed. Very well, I refuse. Hey! I thought I saw Henri go past. - Who? - Plantin. - Who is Henri Plantin? - Don't know any more. He's dead. Your go. You don't give a damn, do you. Pity you're not a carrier pigeon. Hey...! I'll count up to 5. If you haven't flown away by 5, it means I'll see her again, 1... 2... 3... 4... - Leave me alone! - Watch out for his painting. Nice to see you. Nice of you to invite me to Napoleon's. Give me a glass of "Beaujolis". Beaujolais. Thank you. How did you find my hotel? Oh, when you know Paris... I'm very sorry I never gave you my address. I searched this morning and asked in all the galleries. They told you that they didn't know of me? Yes, but I could see they were lying. They want me because I don't show at their places. So, they spread the word. Anyway, you're here. Thank you. What did you do with your Sunday? I had a walk around Paris with some friends. - And you? - I worked. You work Sundays too? When you feel the need to express yourself, there are no Sundays. Are you going to show me your painting? - Perhaps. - Why perhaps? Very pleased to meet you. Henri Plantin... Peter's an editor... He's also a big collector. I'm sure he'll buy a picture off you. He says he'd like to invite us both to dinner. He says you're bored. No, not at all. He asked me if a lot of nude ladies pose for you. Models? No. I don't paint what I see... ...but what I feel. Pat is very sad. Great grief. - In London? - Yes. Big love with William. So, very unhappy. Widow when the husband is alive. Understand? - Pat is married? - No, but Te same thing. For the sun, or your tears? I don't want to listen to you. Ask for the bill. Peter wants to go. He has a meeting. In London, I hardly ever see him. He seemed happy to see you. Yes... maybe in Paris. Want to go somewhere? I'm tired. The other one... Is he a friend? You know... William. No, I just know him through work. Nice guy? Not very. Not very... It's silly, eh? What? This ruined evening... You must forgive me. It wasn't ruined, because here we are together. Can we see each other for real, some other night? "For real"? Yes, without talking about others. Very nice. If you want to cry, it doesn't matter. You're terrible! - See you tomorrow? - Yes, for sure. For lunch? No, not for lunch. I have to see some boring people. So, in the evening, at the same place? It'd be better if you picked me up. Certainly! See you tomorrow. Hey, Gogaille! Gogaille! Gogaille! What's going on? - Ah, Mr Poule! - What's going on? - It's dreadful! - What is? I'm happy. Very happy. What do you want me to do? You'll never sleep again! Don't bother me with your crap! Before you go, I want to tell you something very important. Mr Poule, you're a dyed-in-the-wool schmuck! Who is it? Gogaille... you don't notice anything?? - Are you drunk? - No, I'm happy. Something miraculous happened to me. When I think of it... Her in London, me in Paris. Each to his own... ...without dreaming what to expect. It was destined! I nearly missed meeting her... It was the postcard. And without Napoleon... If Napoleon hadn't been buried at the Invalides... ...Cleopatra's nose would have been smaller. You sound like a 12-year-old! So what? It's never too late to be 12 years old. And people... I don't care if I'm ridiculed. I don't care about anything... ...except her. I don't care about myself... Isn't that what love is? Why not? What do you think I should do? Just a moment... Let's not get carried away... A warm heart needs a cool head. - You talk about "love"? - No doubt. Exactly, yes. No doubt about it! No... it's never doubtless. There's no word harder to pin down. - That word has done much service. - Yes, but not for me! Let's see... "Lousy... lout..." "Love!" "Feeling, which takes different forms..." "according to the subject that inspires it and whoever feels it." Are you an inspirer or a feeler? I'm a feeler, for sure.. Yeah... "Passion by one sex for the other." "See: concubinage, debauchery, gallantry..." "...lust, licentiousness." - That's promising! - Oh...dictionaries! Quotation: "Love is a tyrant who spares no one." Corneille. Corneille, Racine, Larousse... all tale-spinners. My love is mine, it is real. It has a name... It's called Pat. Patricia Seagrave. And I, Plantin... I'm also real. Me, with that face there...! And that's the one she kissed. In public! Amazing, eh? Amazing to you. A woman is capable of anything, when she loves. You think she loves me? If she's really kissed you... ...it's because of inner feelings. She's incredible. If you saw her... An adorable accent... her eyes, her mouth... Charming... elegant... And then, so delicate, that you hardly dare touch her. You'd better... I just want to console her... ...because she's been given a hard time. So, then... As I see it, you're in love with her... ...and you are in a state of complete well-being. "The Statue of Liberty, Paris at my feet." I've been a sap until now, but not any more. You won't seduce her with your phony painting. What on earth made you say you were a painter?! Wasn't that crazy? You're right... I wasn't thinking. It's too late to tell her what I really am. She wants to see my paintings. Very clever of you! I've limited the damage. I didn't talk about proper pictures, but abstract paintings. That changes everything! Go to bed. Go and sleep. Tomorrow I'll get you out of it. Who's there? Open up! Get up. Someone's at the door. I can hear! Leave my bum alone! Someone's at the door, dummy! Get up! Just a moment! Quick! It's urgent! Hurry up! What is it? We need your wisdom. His wisdom? You're out of luck. He's out of it. Pistache, make some coffee. So your dreamboat is a British one? Weird! It can be arranged for you. She's going to see the perfect decor of the artist at home. Fake Bazaines on all the walls! - I'll do you a fake Paul Klee. - No real Civadusses? Civadusses I keep! Trust me. I'd rather she didn't come to my place. - Why? - I don't want to make fun of her. See what he's like!? Don't you care about her? Of course you do! You honour her, you ennoble her. You glorify her... you transcend her! If you saw her in a figurative artist's studio, I'd say no. But here, where it's totally abstract! You don't seem to realize... ...that to make love in front of a Bazaine, even a fake one, is a privilege. And psychologically, it's a painting that sharpens the senses. - I'm not at that stage. - No time at all! Pat doesn't come across that way. She's still a woman. You just have to know how to take them. Tricky operation. It requires time, style, care... ...purpose, delicacy. Delicacy? Shit! Who ever heard of that? Like when he screws me? Delicacy? It's different with you. As soon as you walked in it was a porno! - Didn't you have a train to catch? - That's the delicacy... ...so you'd have an excuse, a justification. He didn't have the politeness to wait for me to say yes. What were you after? My arse! Talk like that and you'll get kicked in the arse! What was I talking about? Having it off. About delicacy! Just what does she look like? Her? Someone beyond your imagination. He talks pretty. Nice change. I'll tell you something... Don't laugh. Last night, when we parted, I was happy to leave her... ...so I could think about her on my own, without her. Now I can hear her voice whenever I want to... ...and her steps, coming or going. Good ears! Shut up! I know what he means. Oh this is an artist thing, is it?! I don't know if you'll take my advice... ...but don't throw away all your cards. But to mark the occasion, you should give her a little present. Not flowers... they don't last. A little jewellery-type thing. Something she'll wear, that will remind her of you... ...that you're with her. - A ring! And that's a real stone. I see. A tourmaline. It's from Madagascar. My mother's family. In Madagascar it's known as a pink diamond. I've kept it aside. I was planning to give it to a girl I might have loved, so to speak. Or who was worth it. But I've not been given the opportunity. I could have given it to my wife, but it'd be like giving it to myself. I wasn't going to give myself a ring. So, I kept it. Luckily for you. Today, to find the same thing... It's worth a lot, you know. Exactly. I can't afford a ring at this price. I give it to you on one condition. You'll pay me when you've won the trifecta. Thank you. It's good Simone and the boys are out of sight. It's nothing to do with them. All the more reason to keep it that way. - Is that you, Henri? - Yes. No, I'm having a bath. Wait. - Did you go home last night? - Yes. I was afraid you wouldn't come today. Why? Because of everything. All the annoying things. Because of Peter? Not just because of Peter. I had a very good evening. Would you be a sweetie and pass me my bathrobe. It's under the bed. Or on the chair... Or maybe in the wardrobe, I don't know. Can't find it. Men are all the same. They can't find anything. Men in general. Hello, Mr Banana tree. I'll soon be ready. Am I early? Not at all. I was expecting you. What? I said that Paris is a terrible town. - What did you say? - I was talking about you. Might I hear what you said? Yes. Stay in there while I get dressed. See you later! Pat! Isn't this your bathrobe? - Where did you find it? - In the bathroom. Leave it. I don't need it any more. I'm terribly hungry. How about you? Starving! Do you like me in this? Maybe too much! Just maybe? That's not saying I love you. Do you think you should be in love with me? Is that forbidden? No, I don't know you well enough to forbid you. Ah, there it is! I got the impression you'd gone back to London. It's nothing. I had a conversation with a ghost. - Where's my bag? - What's a "ghost"? A ghost is someone who's dead, and sometimes... ...comes back in old castles. Shall we go? Is William the ghost? It looks like a general strike. If you were sick, no doctors. Nobody. Nothing. Don't the French eat in August? The French, yes. The Parisians, no. - Can we eat here? - No, that's the Comedie Francaise. It's closed, too. - Oh, Comedie Francaise! I saw it in London. They did 'The Turkey' by Moliere. 'The Turkey' by Moliere? - Yes, by Moliere I've good news about Peter. William Henri, I'd like to be alone. Don't blame me. I don't blame you. I understand. Tomorrow I'll give you a whole day. I'm tied up tomorrow. A lesson. A painting lesson. A student. Alright... 2 o'clock. OK... 2 o'clock. Pat! This is for you. Henri! - Is it too big? - No... My fingers are too thin. See? It'll stay like that It's a tourmaline. A tourmaline? I love it. Henri! Thanks for the tourmaline. I don't deserve it. - 2 o'clock? - Yes. I'll be there, no matter what. You should have specified the rendez-vous. After that ring, you should be running the show. Can't let the woman decide! No suggestion? Do like in the army... report sick. Until I was discharged, I was always in the infirmary. For me, the doctor was too good at his trade. Did you know what to do? There are some great tricks. To have a fever... a clove of garlic up your backside. It's unbeatable. Or, you dip a cigar in cod liver oil... ...and you smoke it. I just want to be on time for my rendez-vous. In good shape! Take it easy... Still, you can't go asking them for your afternoon, to satisfy some ideal. And an unknown disease, never seen before? - Never seen before? - You're he only one. Something original. You arrive smiling... ...and suddenly, your eyes roll back, you drool... That's epilepsy. That exists. What a shame. So, you're choking... You struggle to breathe. That's asthma. It exists too. There are no disgusting diseases left to invent. There's only one thing left to do... Work accident. Something spectacular... I want blood in the background. The spinning reel, 360 francs.... Two floats, 15 francs. Rollerblades, 170. Two spoons, 120. That's it! So, is that better? - I didn't do it on purpose. - I should hope not. Tetanus. Hardly a risk, but you never know. I'm going to be able to work? And then what?! You'll go home. You'll need to rest for at least a week. Who can take my place? Don't fret about that. Not serious, is it? No, but not to be taken lightly. Another millimetre, and your hand would have been paralysed. Boys... who can tell what a man might do? I'd've never thought you capable of that. Me neither, I assure you. There are times when we surpass ourselves and become a different person. In any case, it takes nerve. We've only got 2 hands! Max. And he found the way... by gesture and word. First class... top stuff! Weren't you frightened? See what he's done? You wouldn't lift your little finger for me! But you aren't English. We'll look after you. We're setting up an art studio in this junk-heap. Go get me the paintings I stored in the closet. I have a great painting at my place. I can go get it. It's wonderful! It has 2 peasants in a field... ...who are looking down to check if it's growing. Doesn't it play music? When you wind it up you hear 'The Bells of Corneville'? Gogaille, help me move this stuff. I'll just change my shirt. Good. With the points scored by the ring and your hand... ...we have to keep up the momentum. You've played your trumps. Now you have to win the hand. - That's all very nice, but... - What? But what?. You didn't go after her. She's crossed the Channel to talk to you about the streets of Paris. Mass has been said. Hopefully she'll skip over the "can't we be friends" act. There's no such thing as friendship between a man and a woman. It's like counterfeit money. Let me go! You know why I brought you here. Get off me...! Get out! Go home! Leave, or Henri will sort you out. Like the Negro... I'll rip him apart! Does it hurt? No, it's my hand. - Are you wounded? - It's nothing. Not serious? A scratch. More blood than harm. Henri, you can't go around fighting every day. That's life. Happens to others. I want to kiss you. And if I don't feel like it? No! You know why I've come. Henri, I haven't promised anything. Yes... it was an unspoken promise. You're the same as Peter. Yes, just like Peter! No, please! It really wasn't worth it. What a face! Henri, are you very angry? Can't we be friends? To hell with "friendship." You help some one... you drop them... too easy! I hate deception. If you have seen me enough, say so. I don't hang around where I'm not wanted. Finished with me? Fine! Goodnight. Meanwhile, they're moving me... ...fixing me up with a studio. My "castle in Spain"! You could have used me to make Peter and William jealous! A foil! That's my role. A stooge! You needed a guide... ...to parade around with a painter. And the idiot was proud to show off his English girl to the world. Pat in blue, in green, in red!! Follow the guide! Napoleon saw me. I looked fine. Who crossed the sea to come and meet me? I made no demands. I chose a book. You've behaved badly. Mass was being said. You talk too quickly. Would you start again more slowly? You're funny when you're angry. I said... I don't know what I said. I have to say mass? No! So why did you say that? Henri Plantin, you are a complicated boy. Yes... Come hear. Closer. Closer. What was that all about? It was about... Slowly. - ...how I want you. - Slowly. Would you please speak very slowly. Slower. Even slower. I want to make love with you, too. It's beautiful. I love it! What in this painting saying? That one...? That was a day... ...where I was fed up, I was sad. And that one? This...? It's a burst of joy, on a sunny day. I used plenty of red and yellow. You have amazing luck. You do what you love doing. You put down whatever comes to mind. You're free... you're happy.... Be quiet...! Yes, I'm happy... I'm very, very happy. How is it with us, now? Us? Henri... Yes? I've never been to Japan... ...or New York, or Rome. I'm not a top model... ...and I did not come to Paris as a tourist. I'm a cover girl. Peter's my boss. I have to depend on him. Disappointed? No, it's better like that. You're nice. I'm not nice. I like that better... But why did you come out with it like that? I don't know. Maybe because you're a famous painter... ...and I was afraid you'd no longer want to know me. You should never be ashamed of what you do. There'd be many who'd love to be a cover girl. Because they don't know what it is. And William? Is that a lie too? Is William important? Very important? Just a ghost? He says it's over. And you? I don't know. I'd like to know, but I don't. Even now? Maybe it's coming to an end. Not bad, eh? I read that it was forbidden to feed the pigeons. Supposed to be. - Who forbids it? - The cops. - It seems they make Paris dirty. - The cops? The pigeons. Lots of people make Paris dirty, and they're still fed. The people don't defecate on the statues. Don't stay here... fly off to Venice! You'll feel at home in Venice. There are lots of statues nicer than the ones here. - What's funny? - I wondered if the neighbours could see you. - Is that forbidden too? - Not yet, but it'll come. It doesn't bother you that they see us? Not at all! Are they used to seeing ladies here? Not at all. You don't entertain women here? Never. So you do it at their place? - Liar! - I swear! You're entertaining me nicely. It's different with you. You ARE a funny fellow! I don't know if you've had a lot of women... ..but you're good at lovemaking. Very good. Have you loved any other women? Other women? No. One women, yes. Do you still love her? It's not the same thing. Like me, you brought her here? Yes, as well. So you see! No. You asked me if I brought women here. I said "No." That's the truth. But one woman, yes. Where is she right now? On holiday. In England? No, in Concarneau. So, what else is there? Is she single? - No. - Widow? No, she's married. Does her husband know? He knows alright. What else...? What does her husband do? He's in business. He's the manager of Samaritaine, the department store I showed you. You're not bothered about her... the two of us here? As I said, it's not the same thing. Has it been long since you were together? A very long time. Does the pigeon know her? Phooey! Your mail. Are you sick? Not working? It's nothing. Bit of an accident. Nice to have your mail brought up. That was the first time. Here... All for you. But nobody knows I'm here. - Would you have any tea? - Tea? Of course! I should've thought of it. Where the hell did Simone put it? - Simone? - Yes, the housekeeper. - Is that it? - Almost. - Do you know how to make tea? - Well I can make chamomile. You're nuts! You know how to make love, but certainly not tea. One, two... And one for the pot. It's like with coffee, isn't it? It's weird. You wouldn't think you were in a great painter's home. I'm not a great painter. You are, and you know it! But you seem to live in someone else's place. Anywhere... at anyone's home. You don't like my studio? Yes, but it should be different. Lighter... more open... more YOU... Less things... Lots of light, and no curtains. You need them for the neighbours. So, only one, in a beautiful fabric... ...which opens to one side. You see? Yes, very well. And hardly any furniture, but solid furniture. Civadusse, he's a painter like me. He likes furniture that hangs from a tree. This is what I mean... See this table? You cut its legs short... ...and put a huge stone on it, like a sculpture. And the walls white... totally white! With some beautiful pictures. Here... there... That one of us, together. Wouldn't that be better? Yes... I love the big stone. Oh... what a pretty lady! Is this your family? My sister-in-law and my nephew. You have a brother? I've a family like everyone else. What does your brother do? He's not here. On holidays? No, he's dead. I'm sorry. Was he young? A year older than me. I look after his wife and their children. Must cost you a lot. It does. You find her pretty? Yes, very. She looks like she'd make you happy. Is she in love with you? I've sometimes wondered. She should remarry. With two children... What did your brother do for a living? He wasn't very successful. He was in business, but he lacked ambition. You let yourself go. You have kids and there's less time to think about yourself. Life becomes a struggle. In her place, I'd get married again. Henri, I want to make love. Now? What's up with you? What do you mean by "NOW"?! - What? - You Frenchmen...! I've been told what extraordinary lovers you are. Always ready for it, no matter what... Even while driving a car. People exaggerate a lot. You know what time we got to sleep? All I can see is that you're still asleep. Last night, you found me the prettiest, the most marvellous... Is it over already? You're totally nuts. Your poor Pat! She should just go back to where she came from. Still, I'm not too bad at all. Don't I have beautiful eyes? Beautiful ears? Pretty hands? My bosom? And my back? My navel? I can detail myself. I'm not too bad at all. So? I'm going to sleep... I didn't really think that you'd want to... I'm going to sleep. - Going to sleep. - No.. Thank you. Thank you. There we are! - You went out like that? - Yes! Nothing on underneath? Me. Did the concierge see you go out? Yes, but everyone was very nice. Do you want any help? No! Wait for me in the next room. You know this? No, what is it? Guess. - Some gymnasts? - No! This is the Bastille Day parade. The mountain infantry... The military academy... The police force... The heavy tanks... the pride of our army... The parachute troops, pride of... ...nothing at all. Strange... doesn't look like the pantry of someone who lives alone. There's everything you need. I don't eat at restaurants. Does the store manager's lady cook for you? Don't be silly! The Foreign Legion. Pat... Yes? I'm married. The photo... it's her? Yes. The children? The children too. I don't have a brother. Do you think I wouldn't have come, if you'd told me before? So... why now? Because now I love you. You tell me you're married because you love me. Isn't that odd? Yes. I wasn't asking you for anything. If I didn't care for you, I would've gone on lying. When you said you'd loved her, you didn't lie. I wasn't lying, but since... Since it's not the same thing? You've got no intention of divorcing her, so... I don't want to take anything from anyone. I've been happy for a bit. Can't complain about that. Just for a bit. I want to be happy all the time. No one is happy all the time. It's not nice to be greedy. It gives you heartache. Think about it, Mr Banana tree. Our affair... what is it? Holidays... a summer affair... - A month of August affair. - It's something else. I think you know it's something else. Listen... You have your wife, I have my ghost. I'm also as stupid as you... I don't know what I want. Aren't you terrible? I know what you'd like... Not to leave your wife, but still stay with me. Fall asleep in London and wake up in Paris. That's difficult. Do you see me alone with my wife? Once it was good, but now? "Once" or last Friday? By autumn, we'll be nice memories. In London I'll think about my time with the artist Henri Plantin... And you'll think about me thinking about you. "The artist Henri Plantin..." I've no regrets knowing the artist Mr Henri Plantin. You'd be the only one. Pat, listen to me! No. There's something serious I need to tell you. Nothing is serious. I've had enough of your confessions. Let's just forget it? You were playing me "Bastille Day". Pat... - Do you have a phone? - On the counter. There's no booth. Thanks. A black coffee please! Peter Grantson, please! - Is there a cab rank near here? - Yes, on the left. - In the street, to the right. - Thank you. Goodbye. The way she walks! Another American. Do you know where she slept last night and the other night? Plantin! When his wife finds out... Why should she find out? Doesn't she deserve to hear about it? It would be much better for you if she never does. Why is that? If she did find out, it could cost you dearly... ...and the life of your cat. - You've weak heart, no? - That's the rumour. A heart attack... What do you mean?! I'd never... So don't risk a spanking! I've used a gun for less than that, Mrs Pampine. So there you are? What's with the look? To photograph that... I've been making love all night. Does it show? I couldn't care less. Just be on time. Fix up her coat! How's your painter? In the state I left him? If he'd wanted to, he would have flattened you. Flattened me? You're nuts. Totally nuts! He would've killed you! - What floor's the painter on? - What painter? The picture-painter. Mr Henri Plantin. What? What are you thinking about? I'm thinking about nothing at all. Does your wife like to sunbathe, too? Maybe I shouldn't stay here. If the neighbours could see me... What do you want me to do? Wait, I'll show you! Rest your head there. Isn't that nice? Yes, little brother. Very nice, little brother. That's for the neighbours. You dope! The Mediterranean is beautiful. A change from the London fog. London fog? Where did you hear that? There's also sun in London. It's very pretty in the sun. I'm going to go there. Why not? Christmas I London... My key, please! Hello, Mr Plantin... No hard feelings? I practised some French with your concierge. A charming woman. But she doesn't appreciate your painting. Your raincoat that you left in the car. I ran after you to give it back. I almost went up, and then, I didn't dare. Fishermen don't like to be disturbed, eh? Thanks very much. Your passport... be careful! You have everything? Money, papers, ticket? Yes, I have everything. For once, be on time tomorrow. 6.22 at the Gare Du Nord. She hasn't told you she's leaving tomorrow? You both hid a lot of things. Were you going to leave without saying anything? Wouldn't it have been better? Did you get my letter from London? Miss Wesley. Will it be a long stay? One week. It's my first time in Paris. We'll put you in 54 for now, but tomorrow... ...we'll move you to another room. Would you fill out the form please? Gare Du Nord? I thought the London station was Saint-Lazare. I came to Saint-Lazare from the ferry. The Silver Arrow is the Gare Du Nord. I'm not going up now. I want to see Paris first. - Do you know where the Seine is? - Yes, I'll show you. He said 6.22, didn't he? Yes, perhaps... I don't know any more. I don't want you to come to the station. Peter and the others will be there. I don't want them to see us leaving each other... Understand? We can say goodbye here. Tonight. Alright? Hey... Save money... don't invite friends. - Are you going on a trip? - Yes, here's my key. Going for long? Give that to Simone. What'll I tell her? You'll think of something. Yeah... If she asks where you are? Did I tell you where I'm going? I was looking for you. If you want to use the car... I left the keys with Gogaille. Get back to business, and thanks for everything. Have you got what I asked for? 150, right? Didn't bother you too much? It was a matter of life and death. - I left the keys with Gogaille. - You already said. - She's OK? - With "The Observer". - You'd better get moving... - I'm going. Bye bye! That's it... Bye bye! I'm looking for Pat. Isn't she here yet? No, she always arrives at the last minute. She'll come. She MUST come. I'm going to London with her. But she won't come. She's leaving Orly by plane at 7.20. By plane? You can still catch her. Don't waste time! Quick! Hey! I did not say anything about the painter. But hurry! Pat! Why did you come? Wait for me... I'm coming with you! With you! It's Peter. I made him promise. With you to London! With you! You and me! You and me? We've said goodbye the way I wanted... I wanted to leave with a fond memory. And now you come and spoil it all. Why? Together! Peter told me you took the plane. I already had my train ticket. I'm not angry... but I was afraid... I couldn't cope at the station.. It doesn't matter, since I've found you. I'm coping quite well. Very well. It doesn't matter, we'll take the next one. Plenty of time. Miss... everyone is on board... quick! No... tell her we've got time! Henri... tell her we'll take the next plane! We'll take the next plane! I think that I love you. I'll be back... You know I'll come back... Mr Banana tree. Pat, stay with me! Don't leave me! Wonderful! Really wonderful... Just what I've always wanted. I never told you... ...but the white walls enlarge the room. Like an artist's room. Careful, children, no marks on the walls! From now on, you'll wash your hands. That's a Civadusse painting? It must be expensive... ...for what he sells! You don't look well. You can see I wasn't here. This rock's very pretty. You wouldn't recognise Concarneau. So much change in a year! They've even built a dance hall. Didn't they, Veronique? Keep that one. She had a flirt. A "flirt"... Always with the fancy words! Seen this, Daddy? Look what Daddy bought me... a linguaphone. We'll throw out the paint pots... we don't need them any more. How's Gogaille? - Has he heard from his wife? - Yes. Say... tomorrow's Sunday... What'll we do? Like to take the kids to the movies? Know who I ran into down there? The Blanchets. They're back together. They walk hand in hand. You wouldn't think so at that age. It's so nice to be back in your own place. Enough of holidays! Have a coffee with me? No, I'll make myself a tea. - You drink tea now? - Yes. I take tea now. You're not very talkative. I just feel like talking. And on the train, the children wanted to sleep. Impossible, with all the soldiers on board. One woman and all those soldiers. Swept away by September... Our love of a summer... Sadly dismembered... And dying in the past. All that I'd hoped for... And now my heart is empty... Scoured by the memories.. Of Paris in the month of August. Of the tears and the laughter... That made up our love... That now dreads the worst... Living day to day. Every street, every stone... Seems to be just for us... We were alone on Earth... In Paris in the month of August. To tell you "I love you".... As far away as you are... A part of myself... Has stayed hooked onto you... And the rest, all alone... Searches everywhere... In the blinding light... Of Paris in the month of August. God, make that my dream... To find just a little... Of the month of August on your lips... Of Paris in your eyes... To take shape and raise Our love a little madly... So we can start again... In Paris in the month of August. Subtitles by FatPlank for KG
