Cool, pal. Keep cool. I'm not shitting you. I'll fucking blow her head off! - Are you nuts? - Your car is about to arrive. You said it half an hour ago. That's bullshit! Do I look dumb? No need to be this aggressive. I have the money right here. Now give me my fucking car. Look at what I found. - Honey… - Open it! Look, you don't need to work there, but take it. [SPECIAL PROJECTS] Who knows if you'll get inspired... Create something new... Thank you. Do you know what you'll do these days? Not yet... I'm going to a concert at the park, but I'm still not sure about the other days. You could walk him. We have talked about it, mom. Solange is going to walk him, give him water, feed him. Don't worry. Isn't it, my little cutie? No! No! It's fine like that. Is Paulinha going to the concert? Yes... I haven't talked to her, but I think she is going. I'm inviting her. Marilia… You don't wanna go. You don't need to go if you don't want to. Stay. - Am I interrupting something? - No. Come here. I didn't you leaving, ninja. Only a ninja could bring the gift I brought without being spotted. You bought that car. How do you know? We talked about it last week, didn't we? Last week I just bought the car. Today I picked it up at the repair shop. You already sent it to the mechanic? I armored it. Have you packed? Not yet. We leave in 20. I'm a fast packer. Right... Will you help her pack? I will get your bag and leave over the bed so you can pack, okay? Renildo? Good morning. We are leaving now, okay? How was the meeting yesterday? I see. Really? I told you, didn't I? So, it's up to you to talk to them. Gather them and talk! Just don't mention the hotel. Hold on a sec. Ask Cristina to do a good cleanup in the house. We'll hold a meeting there. - Mrs. Teresa? - Yes. - Can you do me a favor? - Sure. Take this medicine and hand it to my mom. - It's for her heart, they don't have it there. - Okay. I would like to ask you something else. Tell Iara to be a little patient because very soon, she'll be with me here in Recife for a while. - Okay, I'll tell her. - Thank you, Mrs. Teresa. Don't mention it. See you! So… Oh, it's quite nice. Say something so the on-board computer can register your voice. What for? I'm not even driving this thing... That's it. Got it. On-board computer, recliners, built-in thermal cup holder... And… the most important… You already said it. The guys at the armor workshop paid special attention when I mentioned I was your husband. Why did you mention it? They know you. They know your story. Everybody likes you. Look at me. Don't be silly. Kiss me. "Don't get startled, man…" Mom, you forgot it, huh? - I also brought that. - What's that? - I will leave it on the backseat. - A little surprise from this little brat. Silly. Call me when you get there. I love you, hun. - I love you too. - But hey... If someone called Paulinha shows up around here... allowance over. Have a good trip. PROPERTY Let's stretch our legs a little? Have some coffee? I'm fine in here. Let's go. Thanks. CAVALCANTI'S FARM Teresa... We're here. Let's go? Wait... Just a bit, okay? - Are you alright? - I'll go out soon. C'mon, love. You promised. Make an effort. It's hard. It's also hard for us, you see? You hide from us inside our own home. From me, from your daughter... You have now idea how it's like. No, I don't. That's why I scheduled you therapy, that's why we moved to the penthouse... That's why I bought this car, that's why I armored it… I still see him. I feel... When you hold me from behind... You know... I feel... his arm around my throat. I still hear the moan that left his mouth when he was shot. It wasn't even a voice. But I still hear it. I'm going in. Meet me there when you feel better, okay? Okay. Renildo! What the fuck is this? Is the repeater working? Yes. I'm going to brew some coffee. Do you want some? I do! Do you know where the coffee grinder... - Good morning. - Good morning. - Good morning, Antonia. - 'morning. - Good morning, Antonia. - Good morning. 'morning. But Mister, you want me to talk to them? - Okay, then... - Pay attention now. I'll show you something. It's just a scrap of paper, right? - Let me take a look... - C'mon, it's a paper. Watch this. Now I rip it off, see? Let's gather the pieces... It's all ripped up, right? Is that really so? No way! When you arrive, it'll all be settled. Okay, Mister. It's alright. Hey, Antonia. Where the heck is your husband? I went to bed by myself and woke up the same way, Mr. Renildo. How is that? Lost your own husband? Thirty years and he didn't change, don't you know? Come on, guys! Come on, guys! Come on! Well, people, have anyone heard about Avelino? Has anyone seen him? He was supposed to talk to you. Did anybody hear from him? - Nothing. - No. Okay, then. I'll do the talk. But I want every inch of attention from you, because this is dead serious. The farm is being closed. - Come again, Mr. Renildo? - For Christ's sake! Calm down. Let me talk. Guys... When was the last time you saw new cattle coming in? The business is falling apart. There's no income anymore. If there's no income, no one earns! If there's no work, we close! - What shall we do? - It's up to each one of you to figure it out. Can you at least tell us what will become of it? A hotel. Why can't we live here, at this hotel? It's a large place! It'll be a hotel for big bucks! They don't want us near them. When will it be closed? After we move the remaining cattle, about four and a half months... Then we close the gates and you go your way. Mr. Renildo, how can you do that to us? What? Me, Mrs. Gisa? - We work here for so long... - I'm just following orders! You're just fucking us up! 'Cause of pesticides my nephew is mute. What will he do outside? This? Again? Do you know why he became like this? 'Cause he messed up while using pesticides. Want to know what else, Dimas? His muteness is music to our ears! - Come on, Mr. Renildo... - God damn... I'll take it, Mr. Renildo. I'll take it. Pay for my plot and shack and give me my papers, and I move on. Ms. Sandra, you have no land of yours here. None of you do, guys. - But we keep this place going! - Indeed. But you are paid for it. Step forward who pays rent here. One more thing: you must pay your debts with Mr. Claudio before leaving. I saw his ledger. You are all there. Some owe a bit. Others owe a bit more... But some owe a LOT more, right, Dimas? Also, you'll get a restitution. - Mr. Renildo? - Shoot. - How much? - I don't know. It's up to him. And if we don't pay Mr. Claudio? You can leave, but your papers stay here. - What? - You can't do that! - You can't do that! - How will we make a living? But buying and not paying is fine, right? Is this the right way? Of righteous people? Your names are all there! Cellphones, perfumes, clothing... Guys... Let's think this through... Let's work as we always did and in the end, God will help us and everything will be okay. How are we gonna pay if we aren't earning money? I won't pay a dime. And you, lady, tell your irresponsible husband that our talk is over. - Move, move! Cristina! - What the heck was that? What is going on? Move, move! Get out of the way! - What are you doing, Joelma? - It's just a picture. - Mrs. Antonia is right there. Delete it! - It's my cell. - Delete it now! - Call someone, Mr. Renildo. - Call who, João? - A doctor, an ambulance... anyone! - Can't you see he's dead? - Then call the police. - Call them now! - But it was just an accident! What are you waiting for, man? Do you think I'm your servant, boy? Show some respect, you fucking thug! - C'mon, Zildo, Hold on! - Easy, easy! Put a leash on your boy, Dimas. Leash him down, otherwise he'll get another spanking. What were you and Avelino talking about yesterday, Mr. Renildo? Well... About this message I just gave you. You ordered him to tell us we are losing everything, right? Do you really think it's easy for me to deliver such bad news? But you knew what he was struggling to achieve here, don't you? Call the police. Call them now! Don't call anyone! - Joelma! - Call the cops, now! There will be no calls. No calls! - Easy, man! - Give it to me! - Give it to me now! - Put the gun down! - Take it. - Easy! Easy! Easy! He'll just erase the photos! Check it here! Let's pull on 3. One, two, three... Pull! Hey, chick. Did you find something? Go away. Go, go! Nothing on the bedrooms. I couldn't crack the safe open. We have to crack it quickly. With the cops here, it'll be all over. We have to drag that safe to crack it open somewhere else. Shut your mouth, man. We're in deep shit because of your nephew. Where is he now? He is inside. I'll deal with him. You do it. Cops will be here for us, but they'll be all over him. If we can't open that safe, I'll take the kids and leave for good. Everyone here wants to go. But empty handed? It's not just about the cash. What about the papers? Without them, we can't prove we worked here. - We'll be able to do nothing! - And what if we open the safe? We stay. Everyone gets their share. The cops come. Do their investigations. Once they're done, we take our share and go. We can make it. But we must keep tight and clam up! And who will hold the money? Who decides how much each one will get? You? Go, go, go! Hurry! Renildo! What the fuck is this... Is the repeater working? I'm going to brew some coffee. Do you want some? I do. Do you know where the coffee grinder is? Go downstairs. I'll follow later. Go. Go. Who is gonna tell me what's going on here? Where's Renildo? He called us to a meeting, but didn't show up. Here? In my house? He commands. We obey. Who is that girl over there? Come here. Come. Put the ring over the table, please. What the fuck have you done here? You're selling everything, Mr. Roberto. And that's enough to ransack my house? Huh? Our families, friends for so long... When did you lose your decency? It ain't decency in kicking us out, sir. That's your problem. Give me my papers and I'll leave. First, pay your debts with Mr. Claudio. What's it to Mr. Claudio? If you don't pay him, I have to pay him. Do you think it's right? Is it right to corner us and make us leave our homes? Homes? What homes? This is my land. It belonged to my family and now it's mine. We always gave you shelter, food, tools and work. And what do I get? My house ransacked! My heirlooms. Busted, scavenged... All fucked up! Hire us to your hotel, Mr. Roberto. Everybody wins. How do you know about the hotel? Where's Renildo? Huh? I will count to 20. If you don't talk, I'll call the cops. Get off him! Get off! - Come here! Come here! - Take him out of here! Shit! Take him out now! Go now! Get outta here! Go! Right there. Easy. Chill out. Easy... Easy... Stay put, right? Everyone is still pissed with you. I'll go upstairs to look for milady. Right? Give me that... Okay, then. Look... don't go out, Zildo. You hear me? Don't go out. God bless you, nephew. Calm down, calm down! - What's going on? - Easy, easy! Start. Turn on. Drive! - Let's remove him! - Help here! - Get him up! - Easy with him! Easy! Come with me, Zildo! She's alive. She's at the phone. She's making a call! The antenna! Turn it off! Go! So what? Hello. Good morning. Nobody here wants to harm you. We just want to chat. Open up, please. Open up. Calm down, Dimas. Calm down... - Easy, man. - My nephew got his face busted! Put your shit together. We need you! - Get off me! - No! Hey, Gisa, come on! Don't start, I'm outta here! With no cash and four mouths to feed? There's no difference in starving here or anywhere else. Don't you see the shit storm coming? The cops were called. Think, what are you gonna do out there with the kids, huh? - Talk some sense to Everaldo... - Leave her! Not another word to her! Do you think I can't handle my things? Come on, Gisa. I've bought this farm. Some of you bought it with your voice, like Zildo. Some bought it with a finger. Some even bought with their skin. Or an eye. I bought it with a child. With a husband. Now it's mine. This is a riot, Antonia... It was not what Avelino had in mind. I want to stay. I want my money. I want my papers. I wanna bring people here, to work. And I wanna earn for my work. Antonia, this beautiful dream of yours is locked away in a safe and inside a car that can bear a .12 shot. And the cops are coming. Calm down, we still have time. Walter cut down the antenna, fast. Time for what? To open the safe and take that woman out? Those who want to leave, now is the time. Robson, here. - Did you fix your bike? - Yup. Take it, go to other properties. Spread the word that Avelino waits for everybody here. Do I tell what happened to him? Not yet. I'll tell them when they arrive. - I'll send a message. - No. If you start the antenna, the lady will call for help. Go and bring as much people you can. Go! The owner. How is he? Mrs. Dulce is with him. I still have to search for meds at the house. And Zildo? He's gonna live. But I think his eye is gone. - And what about this car? - Won't budge. The shots didn't even scratch the glass. Walter is pumping the gas out. I sent Iara there. If something odd happens, she warns us. The Lady should be gone by now. Why didn't she leave? Want to know why? Because Zildo got her. Well... If she won't come out, we've to make her. By talking, that is. And what if she doesn't want to get out? We'll go ahead. But Mrs. Dulce and Mrs. Amara will take care of you, right? Don't be sad. We'll come back to pick you up later. Got it? Cheer up. We'll meet later. OK? Let's go, Gisa. Let's go. Gisa, let's go. Mrs. Amara! Mrs. Amara! Mrs. Amara, help me to get out of here, please! Talk some sense into these people, I beg you! Look! I've brought... I've brought this medicine here for you! Solange sent! It's for your heart. Antonia! It was Mr. Roberto who ordered it. Couldn't keep the gun out of it? He wanted in. Kept asking for Renildo. He just calmed down when I told he went to town. He asked about our meeting early morning. He also asked to say to Avelino that their agreement was still on. Look at this. This is expensive shit... Enough for a feast. These must be eaten fresh. Tonight, probably. Do you feel better, Roberto? Mr. Roberto. Mr. Roberto, Mr. Claudio sent your food. It's in the kitchen. It's enough for a feast. Will you have a business dinner? When are they coming? Tell me. Look, Mr. Roberto, we have your wife. If you don't open the safe for us, we'll keep her. Let me talk with him. I'll give you a hand. Sorry for the lad, Mr. Roberto. He wasn't Avelino's son, but he was his favorite. He lost it when we found him dead. That's life. I woke up this morning without a husband. He kept your land deal to himself. Didn't tell anything, not even to me. You know how he used to treat me, right, Mr. Roberto? Renildo...? Zildo did worse to him. But considering how much Renildo abused him... You want to sell the land, Mr. Roberto. But we want to stay. All we need are our papers and earnings. Right now. You have my word I will bring your wife here. Safe and sound. Teresa...? That's how she's called? Long time no see... I didn't remember her name. She's in that car of yours. But she doesn't talk to us so I can't assure you how she's doing. It will be better for her if you open the safe for us. - Hey, man. - Come down, Dimas! What you're doing, man! Come down! What do you want there, huh? What do you expect to do to this car? You only want chaos. Fuck! What's your deal with that car, uh? Mrs. Teresa? Listen. This should've never happen. We're good folks. Working people. We've been living here forever. Families with children... But we're desperate, 'cause your husband's kicking us out. Cristina... Teresa. - That's all, I guess. - Where are our papers, João? They never signed them! Now tell me why do we keep a scumbag like that alive! Your lighter. Give it to me. João. What's that? Mr. Claudio's ledger. It has all of our debts on it. Give me Zildo's and my share. We're leaving. No. We'll need every dime for what's coming. You're not my mom. I want my money. No way! - What the fuck you're... - This land is ours and we're gonna strive! Nothing's "ours" while that car sits out there! What's your problem, Dimas? What's with you, man? You keep getting in our way! We're in this shit because of Zildo! He wasted Renildo and almost whacked the owner. Zildo did what Avelino should've done instead of plotting with Mr. Roberto. Chill out, Dimas. Avelino was trying to build something for us here. Worked hard for it. Is it so? Ask Milady here if Avelino had any debt in Mr. Claudio's ledger. Go on. Twice you came like an animal, charging at the car. - I almost had her out. - Oh, and what for, João? Tea and toasts? Or to vamp her with the bullshit you use with all ladies here? Listen, Antonia: we must kill the owner and hide his body. Then break in that car and finish that woman. I know that, you know that and all of you know that. Now, Antonia, if you have another idea... you are either as dumb or as shady as your man. Hold on to that thought. I'll check later to get my cut. What the fuck, Mr. Roberto? Have you lost it? Why did you do this? Change his bandages. But he's already dead! Do what I say! And keep your mouth shut about this! Go! And you... Take the bandages off his face. Do it! Hurry! Damn you... Mrs. Teresa... Mrs. Teresa, are you listening? What happened to your husband should not have happened. We just want to remain here so we can all grow. We did everything we could for your husband. But his jaw is so busted, that he can't talk to you. He needs a doctor. But the nearest hospital is far away. You're the only one who can take him there. The man who did that to your husband... had just found out he would be kicked out, like all of us. That's why he did what he did. He's not gonna hurt you. We'll turn him in to the cops. Open this door, Mrs. Teresa. I just lost my husband to this damned day. You don't have to lose yours, too. Dimas, what are you doing? Easy, man, easy! Dimas! Dimas! No! "Don't get startled, man!" Fuck! She is gone, man! - Didn't I tell you to drain the tank? - But I did! But she is leaving! Calm down. It's probably only the fumes. No! I'll send Iara there. She is too close to get out, but we must keep an eye on her. Antonia... What do we do with the corpses? Bury them. Avelino's too? Yes. I learned he didn't do you good... - People here used to talk... - Don't mind him. We care about the living first. Then we deal with the dead. What are we doing here, Antonia? Thirty years ago... the kissing bugs infested every mile, from here to the valley. Many people fell to Chagas disease. When our boy got feverish... me and Avelino bought the medicine from Mr. Claudio. We suffered for two months straight. He kept getting worse. We asked Mr. Luis for a ride. He was Mr. Roberto's father. He said the car to the hospital was full. When it got back the next morning, it arrived with "Dollar Bill"... A baby horse. Born the night before. And your boy...? Suffered... but survived. Worked hard here. At 14 he kissed me goodbye and left. He was right. In his own way. He was right. We fight to stay. But we should have left many years ago. Even here the mosquitoes torment us. I'll ask Danilo for a smoke screen. More. Throw a lot more! - Stuff it more! - Push harder! Walter, fetch the dry one right there! More, Sandra. More! Hold on. Let me see it, kid. Watch out. There's diesel all over here. - What's that? It leaked? - No. Someone spilled it. Who could do something like that? Who's gone since dusk, huh? - Walter, the power generator? - It looks fine, but... - there's not much fuel left. - How long can it last? Not much. Should I turn it on? Do it. Fire it up. Let's go! Mrs. Teresa! Mrs. Teresa! She's still here. Look. Here. Give it a nudge. There's something here. It's her phone. There's no one here! It was flashing right now! - There's no one here. - It's on automatic. - So, let's turn on the antenna. - It's already on. Send messages, spread the word. Gather people to get her now! That bitch! Jesus fucking Christ! Get her, Junior! Go, Junior! Get her, man! Run, Junior, run! Go, man! Get her! Wait! Open up! - Open the door! - Open up! Get away from the door! Mrs. Teresa! Forget everything, for God's sake! Open this door! Let the boy go! I swear! Nobody will harm you! Come! - Push! - This is the spot! Come on! Together! - Push! - Let's go! Now! Go! Push! Push!
