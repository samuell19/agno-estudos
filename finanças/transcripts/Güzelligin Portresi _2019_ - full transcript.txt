What kind of fucked-up driver are you? I'm Oktay, from Homicide. -Hello. I'm ?zg?r. -Hello. Please come in. Come here, Alin. Please wait outside for a while. Come with me. Go away! CRIME SCENE INVESTIGATION How did it happen? Two days ago, he was found dead in this room. We couldn't find any evidence of a break-in on the doors and windows. We haven't received the blood test results yet, but it seems he was rather drunk. He stabbed himself in the throat with a knife. Could you please cover that? I'm sorry. Forensics hasn't finished yet. Ms. Nisan, did your father have any violent tendencies? No. Didn't he ever get angry? Didn't he ever lose his temper? Not that I've witnessed, at least. My father was a distant man. He was just a normal father. So why did you run away from home? You were sixteen. I found the missing person notice your father issued for you. Nisan ?rkmeno?lu. Isn't that you? -I was an adolescent... -An adolescent! Is that it? Oh, well. What's going on here? Are you interrogating me? No, of course not. I just wonder how much you know about your father's life. I'm sorry. You're still mourning. I'll talk to you later. Don't go anywhere. Mom, have we become rich now? No, dear. Were you cross with grandpa? I wasn't. We just didn't meet much. How did grandpa die? There was an accident. Go to sleep now. We have a lot to do tomorrow. But I'm not sleepy at all. I'm so glad to have you. I love you too. Art questions both the good and the bad parts of life. Asil didn't believe in love at all. He loved to depict the evil. And that's why he was always alone. Sorry. I don't know what to say. I'm so sorry. We're all shocked. Your father meant a lot to me. If I'd known this would happen, I wouldn't have left him alone for a second. Darling, Levent is a close friend of my father. He's a gallery owner. ?zg?r, my husband. He's a painter too. -Nice to meet you. -Nice to meet you, too. I don't know your genre or your style, but... this is quite ironic. You must be hungry. Shall I get you something to eat? No, I'm alright. Thank you. Nisan. It would've been nice to bring a few of your father's paintings from the studio. Why? This isn't an exhibition. I wanted to talk to you about that. Your father and I were-- There won't be an exhibition. -Why not? -We've just lost him. It would be disrespectful to his memory. Nisan, listen. Up in the studio there are many paintings waiting to be sold. Levent, I don't care about money. The paintings are mine now. There'll be no exhibition. Excuse me. -I shouldn't leave her alone. -Wait. Do you love her very much? My wife? Well, of course. Good, so persuade her to have this exhibition. Because Asil had decided to sell Portrait of a Beauty. It's been announced. I'm sorry,? but I can't help you. Why not? Nisan can't think straight right now. She's very emotional. So you want me to prepare? an exhibition with you secretly? Me? You don't have to decide now. Think. Call me when you've changed your mind. I won't change my mind, Mr. Levent. I won't go behind my wife's back. Have a nice day. Shit. A step to the right, madam. Sir, could you please get closer? Ready! This is not a simple suicide case. Sir, the woman might know and might be hiding something from us. -Maybe she knows his past. -Where's the proof? How do you know she's hiding something? You're up to the same shit again. You drink up and imagine things. Don't let me catch you there again. Close that case. It's done. Motherfucker. That's good. -I drink up and imagine things! Bastard! -That's good. Ready! Welcome, darling. They've called about the meeting. I totally forgot. Sezgin would've given the translation to someone else. That meeting will have to wait for a while. What do you mean? This will take more than a few days, honey. The lawyer couldn't get it done. Didn't you tell him we didn't want anything? -The house, the car, nothing... -Of course I did. But it's not all about us. Your father left paintings all over the place. Their evaluation, and some stuff about the car... Lots of things came up. How long would it take? Perhaps a few weeks, or even months. I don't know. So, are we trapped in here? "Trapped" is a bit of an exaggeration. I might suggest staying in a hotel, but that would be too expensive. And we don't know how long we'll have to stay. What can we do? We'll need to bear it, right? Since we're staying here, let's make the most of this beautiful house. Dad? Is that you? Dad? Mom? Alin! Look what you did! Wait... I heard a terrible sound! What sound? Like nails scratching on wood. You must have imagined that. Listen to me. This is an old house, dear. It must be the pipes. Don't worry. It wasn't. Someone was making that sound. You must've been mistaken, my dear. Once again, my condolences. I'm sorry. I couldn't come to the funeral. But I made you some halva. Maybe you couldn't make any. Let me serve it. Eat it fresh. It's a good deed. What was your name again? Hilal. Hilal, thank you, but... Who are you? I was the caretaker of this house. Cleaning, laundry, dishes... I took care of it all. But I didn't stay the nights. Mr. Asil wanted to be alone. I can continue to work, right? I know this house very well. I know all about it. Hilal, that would've been great, but we'll be leaving right after the inheritance is sorted out. It's alright. Let me stay as long as you do and help you around. I'll look for another job in the meantime, okay? We're not doing very well financially these days. Oh, I see. Well, so I'm out of work. Once again, my condolences. Here's what we can do. You can stay in the house. You can eat here too. Once we sort out the inheritance, you can pick some things from here. We can perhaps sell them, or we'll get even somehow, right? Is that good for you? You think I can move out of my place? Well, of course. You won't have to pay rent, then. It's good. It's better than being unemployed. So, I'll go and make you some foamy Turkish coffee. It's a huge house, sweetheart. And we don't know how long we'll stay. You shouldn't get too tired, right? I couldn't turn her down. You're too obsessed with that painter and her daughter. Fuck it. Three years ago, I was on night watch one day. We got a call. Screams were heard from the painter's house. -So? -So, I went to check it out. The guy opened the door. He didn't let me in. He started swearing. He was yelling, "What are you accusing me of?" I said okay. I'm sorry. I went to the nearest hospital. I've asked around. A girl came in that night. I thought I'd get her to talk. I was sure she came from there. The girl was gone. She fled when I told her I was a cop. -Then? -I went to the chief. I said, "Sir, this bastard is up to something." "I'll go after this guy. I'll give him a rough time." What did he say? Fuck him! Bastard! Maybe there was pressure or he was paid... He issued the transfer order the next day. So that's how you ended up in Erzurum? To Erzurum. He said I damaged his reputation! Bought-off bastard! He was guilty, and he had me sent away. Three years. I lived a shitty life there for three years. Fortunately, someone killed the guy, and here I am. Didn't he commit suicide? Don't be stupid. Who would stab oneself in the throat? Something fishy happened there. I'll figure it out. And I'll throw it on the chief's face. Okay, enough of this. Cheers. Dad! Mom! I saw you! You're in there. Dad! Alin... Alin... Alin! Alin! -Dear! -There's someone there! -What happened? -There's someone there! It's nothing, dear. It's over. Put your arms around me. Let's go. It's over, dear. There's nothing here. You know, I too was very afraid in this house when I was little. -Really? -Of course. And unlike you, I didn't have my mother with me. You know what I did when I was afraid? What? When I saw something scary, I used to shut my eyes and my ears? and say "It's nothing. It's nothing." And then I'd open my eyes, and really, there would be nothing in front of me. Would you like to try it too? It's nothing. It's nothing. It's nothing. That's it. If anything happens, if you're scared, call out for me. I'll come to you right away. Okay, dear? It's nothing. She must have had a nightmare. It's nothing. Oh, Hilal! That looks delicious. -It's French toast, Mr. ?zg?r. -No more Mr. ?zg?r. Nobody who makes me French toast can call me "Mr. ?zg?r." Okay, ?zg?r. Good morning. Good morning. Good morning. Thank you, Hilal. But don't fall in that trap. Don't say I didn't warn you. He'll make you call him ?zg?r and... You'll be in the kitchen forever. Oh, come on. I'm a reasonable man. Drink your orange juice, dear. Hilal... Are you any good at making moussaka? I'll make it for dinner, Mr. ?zg?r. ?zg?r! What? I didn't ask her to cook it. -It was just intellectual curiosity. -What's this doing here? What? Get that out of here. -Why is that here? -I brought it from the studio. How dare you hang it? You told me to hang it. I didn't tell you that! Calm down, dear. Ms. Nisan, I swear to God you told me... Don't lie to me! Nisan! -Where did she find it? Why did she hang it there? It's not her fault. Is it my fault? I didn't tell her. Do you believe me or her? I believe my ears. You told her to hang it. We were in the kitchen, for dinner. Don't you remember? -I couldn't have said that. -Why not? Because I burned that painting when I left! I scared Alin. I'll check on her. MOM IS LYING Alin. It's nothing. Alin. Can I come in, dear? Alin? Why did you lock the door? Open it. Will you always stay here? Alin? What's your name? Alin! Alin, please open the door! Who were you talking to? To her. But I told you, the pipes can make such sounds. You imagined it. I told you. It wasn't just the sound. She wrote there. What did she write? "Mom is lying." What? She said, "Mom ran away, but the nightmare isn't over." -She said, "Grandpa stabbed his throat." -Enough! Shut up. Mom doesn't believe me. She says I'm imagining it. I do believe you. There's something in this house. Maybe that thing isn't bad. It is bad, my dear. Those things can only be bad. She speaks to me. Take this. With this on you, she can never speak to you. Nothing can hurt you. Don't be scared, okay? ?zg?r? ?zg?r! ?zg?r. ?zg?r. ?zg?r! Do I have to talk? I have a question. Can I just ask it, take my drugs and leave? Therapy is an important part of the process. I hate this. What? This place. Being here. This room. The magazines in the waiting room. Being treated equal to that man with the crazy eyes in there. What else? Coming back. What else? Myself. Why do you hate yourself? Because while everyone else lives normally, I have to take drugs. When did your attacks first begin? I've had them since childhood. Why do you think they started? I don't remember. They got worse with time. Panic attacks, nightmares. I left home early. I studied abroad. I got married there and had a daughter. From my first husband. ?zg?r is my second husband. Good. Come here! There! Oh dad! You've got to work for it. I won't make it easy for you. But don't hold me there! There, there! Did your attacks continue throughout that period? They had gone away. The drugs had worked. But then, they started again. When? The night my father died. What do you remember about your father? Nothing. And your mother? She died when I was five. You said you had a question. My problem... Can it be hereditary? I mean, could my daughter have inherited it from me? There! Run for the ball. Did she experience anything suspicious? She had a loss in the family at an early age. We should look at it. Have you taken her to a doctor? Alin. What happened? Nothing. I thought you were gone. I'm not gone, sweetie. I'm here. Yours is post-traumatic stress disorder. The nightmares, the confusion, the panic attacks... In fact, I had recovered. It was gone. You've had a troubling experience, Ms. Nisan. Once we find out what it is, you'll be fine. Don't worry. Let's start with a tranquillizer. What do your daughter and your husband think about your condition? He doesn't know. Come here. Let's play some more at home, right? Come on. Family support matters a lot in cases like this. I think you should tell your husband right away. Nisan. Nisan. Nisan? Darling? Darling. I called you like 30 times. Didn't you hear me? I didn't. I was lost in thought. Nisan. Is there anything you'd like to talk to me about? No, everything is alright. What happened... in this house with your father? -What's this about? -I know I said I wouldn't ask. But I can feel it. It's about your father. I drifted off for a minute, and that's your conclusion? You've been feeling unwell since we got here. It's work stress, dear. The publisher is nagging me, you know. Okay, let's get rid of that stress. I found a camp for Alin in Sapanca for next week. -Why? Alin is alright! -I know, darling. I know she's fine. It would be a nice change. We'll get away from here for a few days together. No. I need to turn the translation in on time. Forget the translation. I'm telling you you're not well. You keep wandering off. You can't sleep. You keep yelling unnecessarily. We both know where this leads to. So, I'm going crazy. Is that so? Oh well. Thank you. You've really helped me. Nisan! By the way... I'd appreciate it if you asked me before making plans for my daughter. For your daughter... She's your daughter now? Ms. Nisan... Are you sick? Let me make you some linden tea. No. These are vitamins. Don't tell ?zg?r. He might get worried. It's nothing. It's nothing. It's nothing. Yes? Hello? Hello? Mr. Levent, it's me. ?zg?r. I'd like to talk about your offer. That's great. I'm pleased. Let's do this exhibition. Don't get me wrong. It's not about the money. So, what for? To get rid of those paintings. There's something in this house that's bad for my wife. That's up to you, ?zg?r. I had already started the preparation. I just need one thing. -What? -A power of attorney from her. You'll get it, right? I'll find a way. Great. Let's keep in touch. Hello, detective. What are you here for? For the paintings, of course. I'm an art enthusiast. How much is this one? We're not open yet. Okay. How much will it be once you open? -Ten thousand. -Isn't that too cheap? -Sorry? -Two broken ribs, a fractured femur. Loss of vision in the left eye. Isn't 10,000 too cheap for all that? How much will this one be when you open? Let me guess how much that one is. Cuts on the back and the arms. Second-degree burn on the left leg. And let's throw in a ruptured spleen too. It's not easy to paint that kind of thing. It's easily worth 30,000. Is it a crime to be sensitive to the suffering of women? No, I'm sensitive too. That's why I was asking, as an art enthusiast. I like art. Art is good. What about that one? I want a list of your models. Under what investigation exactly? Detective. I don't know why you came here or why you're asking these questions... but if you come here again without an official warrant, we'll have problems. Problems of the kind you've had before. You must remember. I'll shove that complaint up your ass! Don't! ?zg?r! ?zg?r, help me! ?zg?r! -Nisan! -?zg?r! ?zg?r, help me! -Nisan! -?zg?r! There's someone inside! -There was someone inside! -It's alright. A woman came out of the closet. -She followed me. -Okay, Nisan. Calm down. -Where was she? -She was there! There! She was there! There's nobody here. She was there! Really! She walked up to me. She came out of there, ?zg?r! She was really there! She walked up to me. She was here! There's someone there! There's nobody there, dear. I promise. There really was! I'm telling you the truth! -There's someone there! -Nisan, there's nobody. -Nisan... -There's someone there! There's someone there! Nisan! There's someone there! There's someone there! There's someone there! We must leave this house. -Where to? -Wherever. Let's just get in the car and go. I don't care about the inheritance. Please, let's go. We can't leave now, darling. This is a legal process. And we don't have money. Find a way. Find a way. ?zg?r, I can't take this anymore. This house is no good for me. Please. Just tell me. Okay. I'm not asking. Listen, I'll visit the lawyer today. I'll try to expedite the process. As much as possible. I promise. Can you hold on until then? I'm with you, darling. Don't worry. Ms. Nisan. You've left the water running. I took care of it. -Hello, welcome. -Hello. Can I have a coffee? -Right away. -Black, please. -Here. -Thank you. Enjoy it. Ms. Nisan. -Hello. -Hello. I was going to call you today. Are you alright? You look a bit tired. Have a seat. Thank you. I guess you haven't had much sleep. No, I'm alright. That was silly of me. How can one get any sleep in that house after all that happened there. I told you before. Nothing happened in that house. Oh, of course. Except your father committing suicide. Listen, I didn't care about my father when he was alive, and I don't now. Understood? Don't ask me anything about him again. Even if he was murdered? -What are you talking about? -I'm not saying anything. I wish you talked to me. Who might have wanted to hurt your father? Or maybe your father have hurt someone? There were many complaints along those lines. All were silenced. But you know something. I can see that. I don't know anything. Don't you find it strange? One may shoot oneself in the head, take some pills, or jump out of a window. But nobody stabs oneself in the throat. Look, I'm only trying to reveal the truth. Maybe you were a victim too. Did you run away from him? Did you? Talk to me. I must go. -Is the list complete? -Yes, it is. -You haven't omitted anyone, right? -It's all done. -Have you added Mr. Minister to the list? -Yes. I told you, didn't I? I said no exhibition! How could you do this? How dare you! Let's hang this near the entrance... What are you doing here? -I... -We're organizing it together. ?zg?r brought the paintings from the house. Nisan! Nisan! Nisan, let me explain! Nisan! Let's talk for a minute. It's not what you think. I did it for you. To get rid of them for you. Are you kidding me? You could've tossed them out, burned them, given them to someone. Why sell them? -They're works of art! -They're garbage! Garbage! They may be good for you, for my father, for him. But not for me! Enough! I can't take this anymore. What happened with your father? Why do you hate him so much? For me, he's a talented painter. But he's obviously something else for you. My father was many things for me. He was harsh, scary. But he didn't lie to me like you did. Not a single time. I'm not the only liar! If you were on pills again, you'd tell me, right? Did Hilal tell you? Don't be paranoid. I saw them in your bag. You're getting ill again. There's only one thing that makes me ill. This exhibition! Him, you! Stay away from me! You understand? Stay away from me! Nisan... What do you want from me? What is it you want? What do you want from me? Who are you? Who are you? What do you want? The long-haired woman? Alin. Dear. Don't start this again. This is not a good time. Please. Okay. I'll show it to you later, then. What? The photo of that woman. The photographer brought these this morning. She's not in these. She's not in the one with me. And not in the one with me and dad. This one. She's only in the one with you in it. Do you believe me now, mom? Would you like to hear her name? Vuslat! How come you know it? I'd like to see Oktay Bal. -Upstairs. Second room. -Which one? -Second from the right. -Thanks. This woman. That's her, Vuslat. I saw her in the house back in the day. She was young then, like in the painting. She posed for my father. I don't know why, but she's been coming into the house again. -I'm sure she killed him! -Ms. Nisan... I saw her in the studio. She keeps walking around the house. My daughter saw her too. Maybe she has the keys to the house. I don't know. -Ms. Nisan, please listen-- -I just want one thing. Give me security detail. Or you come with me. Let's go. She died. She committed suicide 20 years ago. She's dead. But I saw her. With my very own eyes! She was in my house. Look! Vuslat's autopsy report. I looked it up when we got the complaints about your father. The thing is, Vuslat isn't the only one who committed suicide. Mr. Mehmet, who bought your father's first painting. He shot his wife and then himself. They returned the painting to your father after the incident. So many deaths. It's not normal. Do you hear me, Ms. Nisan? Ms. Nisan. I was at the police station. Don't you remember how you came here? I called you. I told you to come. We've been talking for a while... Okay. I was planning to make you confront what you've been suppressing, but I guess it's a bit early. Don't worry. We'll try another method. I'm losing my mind. No. If you trust me, we can overcome this. -You're under too much stress. -I'm losing my mind. Ms. Nisan... Alin, come on. We're going. Where are you going? I left the exhibition. You can talk to Levent about what happens next. I'm taking Alin to the camp. ?zg?r. I may have overreacted. But there's something after me. Alin! What are you talking about? There is something... What? ?zg?r, there's... there's some... What, Nisan? What? ?zg?r, there's someone in this house! There's nobody in this house! I'm leaving. Take a few days to get your head together. You don't let me help you. At least let me help Alin. Don't go. Don't go! Ms. Nisan... I'm sorry, but I happened to overhear your conversation... Whenever I'm distressed by something like that... when I feel the walls bearing down on me... I always visit the tomb of a saint. I say my prayers. Shall we go to Sultanahmet tonight? What good would it do? It will be good for you. It will relieve you. There are mosques, tombs there. We can pray all night. Let's leave this house tonight. Okay. You go and do as you say. Pray for me too. You're on leave tonight. Will you stay alone? I've been running away long enough. I won't anymore. No way, Ms. Nisan. I'll stay with you, then. Go, Hilal. What if something happens? God forbid! I don't care what happens. I'll deal with it tonight. Good morning. You were sleeping so tight. I couldn't wake you up. Would you like to eat? Ms. Nisan? My phone! Oktay. Oktay. Oktay. Oktay, forget everything I told you. Good morning to you too, Ms. Nisan! I found the killer! Right. He's lying in his grave. No. I really found her! She's here, in the house. What do you mean? It's Hilal, the girl helping us! She attacked me last night. I'm alone in the house. She's downstairs. Please help me! Please! Okay, I'm coming. Alright. Alright, it's nothing. What should I do? Alin, I'm coming. Ms. Nisan. I brought you breakfast. Ms. Nisan? Oktay. She's inside! She thinks I don't know. Okay, you wait here. -It's her, isn't it? -It's not. What? What do you mean? Is that all? She has a witness, Ms. Nisan. She was with her friend at Sultanahmet. But you have no proof, except your own words. But I saw her! She tried to kill me! I saw her! She wasn't here. She has a witness. That photo. You saw that photo of Vuslat in the house, Oktay! Nisan, enough! I had the photo analyzed. It was the painting itself. It was Portrait of a Beauty by the window. There's nothing else I can do for you. I thought you knew something, you'd tell me something, but I was wrong. Everyone was right. I was wrong. I give up. You need a doctor, not a cop. No, I saw her! Oktay, believe me! I saw her! It was her! Please! Please don't go! Why won't anyone believe me! Okay. I'll call you. Who are you? Tell me. Who are you? Dad! Who are you? I can't be free from you, even if I go to the far end of the world and if you're dead, right? What are you hiding from me, dad? What are you hiding? What are you hiding from me? Why can't I free myself from you? Tell me, why can't I? Who are you? Who are you, dad? What do you still want from me? What do you want from me? What are you hiding? What are you hiding? What are you hiding? What are you hiding? When did you come home? A few hours ago. What happened with Hilal today? She's been crying since I came. Nothing. Hilal, stop making that sound. Hilal! Hilal, can't you hear me? Hilal? Vuslat? My dear one! Haven't you missed me? Won't you hug your nanny? Nisan? I won't let you take over me! Why should I take over you, my dear? You're already mine! Nisan! Nisan, what have you done! She was going to kill me! That wasn't Hilal! She spoke French! She said "You're mine!" The girl was begging you! She was screaming "Stop!" I came when I heard her. -It was you speaking French. -No, she was going to kill me! That wasn't Hilal! They won't let me see my daughter! ?zg?r, please help me! Please help me! -They won't let me see my daughter! -It's okay. Listen to me. Please, listen to me. You have to be quiet now, okay? You won't go to prison. Look at me. No... Look at me. -We'll bury her. -I can't! -I can't do that, ?zg?r! -Listen to me! Nisan, nobody can keep you away from our daughter, okay? -They won't let me see my daughter! -Okay, calm down. Calm down. My God! Quiet! Shit! It's that cop. Nisan! Go to the door and stall him. Listen to me. Go and stall him. I'll clean things up here. -Okay? -Go. -I can't! -Nisan! We'll get out of this house. Go. Folks! I've come to you with happy news! Good news! Open the door! -?zg?r, I can't go there! -Nisan, listen to me! Come on. Don't let him in. Okay? Come on. I'm here with some good news! Where the hell are you? Where the hell are you? Where the hell are you? Hey! Anyone at home? It's time to celebrate! I've closed the case! In my fucked up life... I thought I'd do the right thing just for once! Good evening. I guess you wanted to see me. -I've brought some good news. -Yes. You've closed the case. Isn't your maid here? I've been ringing the bell for an hour. We've fired her. -Why? -Please excuse me. Wait a minute! What's that? We painted Alin's room today. I mean, we were painting it. At this hour? -Let me come in. -This is not a good time. I'm not here as police. I'm here as a friend. -Mr. Oktay, please. -I'm cold. I'll just warm up and leave. I'm cold. -It's too late. -I told you I'm here as a friend. -I said please! -It's too late. Do your superiors know you're here at this hour? After all that happened, I thought we were on friendly terms. You were wrong. Unless you have a search warrant, please stop disturbing us. Or I'll have to notify your superiors. I came here as a friend. Good evening. Come on. Let's finish this. Is he gone? Brother. I need a favor. I need you to look something up. I can't look it up myself! They'll find out why I'm looking. Chief would fuck me up. You're the man. Nisan. You can leave. I'll take care of the rest. What shall we do now? I must surrender to the police. No. Don't be silly. You need to be treated. After that, we'll find a way. I'm a bad person. You're not. You're simply ill. There are things you don't know. My father... he wasn't a normal man. I was so afraid of him. Did he hurt you? Not me. The Women of Suffering. That's the series that brought him fame. People thought he painted those women because he was sensitive to their pain. It was the opposite. It was him who hurt them. Vuslat. I remembered her later. Vuslat. She died. And you... I've seen it all. I listened to their screams. I did nothing. Why didn't you tell someone? I was afraid. I was alone with him in this house. So many years... How did you keep it to yourself? I don't know. I thought I'd forget it. But I didn't. I couldn't. It made me ill in the end. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. My dear. Don't be naughty when I'm away, okay? You said you'd never leave me. You promised. Alin! You should've let me come with you. I spoke to the lawyer. It's all ready. And here's the power of attorney. Take good care of our daughter. Where is this guy? He disappeared... Hello? Yes, it's me? Really? Okay. Okay. I'll be there. She says ?zg?r left everything to her. I'll go and get Portrait of a Beauty. Sorry, who are you? I'm the wrath of the portrait. I'm the price of your sins. What! What do you want from me? What is this? Will you kill me? I'm not a killer. But you are. You're feeling dizzy, right? You can barely breathe. Your heart is pounding. You're getting paralyzed. Now, remember that dark night you spent with Asil! Do you remember? Look up! Look at me! -You don't want it? -I don't want it! I don't want it! Stop! -Stop it! -Is this what you want? Stop it! That's it! That's it! She's dead! What have you done! I sought beauty. It turned away from me. -Hold her! -I can't! You're losing your breath, aren't you? You feel like you're suffocating. I felt the same way when I was watching you from that closet. Levent! Alright. Hold on. Do you remember me now? Remember who I am? You're Vuslat's daughter! I was. I was Vuslat's daughter. But I wasn't alone in that closet. There was someone else with me. Good bye. Time for pills. What is this? What am I taking? Take it, Ms. Nisan. Don't give us trouble. No. This is not my medicine. What is this? Ms. Nisan, perhaps you shouldn't teach me how to do my job. Listen, I've been taking handfuls of these pills for days. My own pills are in my bag. I left them to you. Go and check. I won't swallow this. Tell me what it is. I'd like to see my doctor. I won't take them otherwise. Dad? Dad? Dad? Dad? Who prescribed you these pills? My psychiatrist. Ms. Nisan, this is not a?tranquilizer. What? What have I been taking all this time? This is a red-list drug. A strong?hallucinogen. Oh no! She changed my pills! Ms. Nisan, calm down. She changed my pills! Wait a minute, you don't understand! I've been seeing all those things just because of these drugs! So I'm not losing my mind! I'm alright! I don't have to stay here! Really, I'm fine! Can you please call my husband? Please call ?zg?r. Tell him to pick me up. -Or call Oktay. -Ms. Nisan, I understand you. But I'm the night doctor here tonight. You can speak to Ms. Sevgi tomorrow morning, okay? Tomorrow will be too late. Please call my husband and tell him to pick me up. Because something is happening. Please! Ms. Nisan, your pills first. I don't have to take them. I'm not ill! Listen to me! You don't understand. I'm not ill! This happened because she changed my pills! Please call ?zg?r! I want to get out of this place, please! Please. Please. Take your pills first. I'll take them. I'll take them. I'm not feeling well right now. I'm feeling sick. I'll go to the bathroom, and then I'll take them. Please. Okay. Alin? Do you like daddy's paintings? Shall we make one of you as well? Would you like that? Come here. Ms. Nisan? Ms. Nisan! Are you alright? She's gone! Taxi! Floor it, please! Here, buddy. The documents you wanted. You're finally right about something. -Really? -Are you happy now? Dad. Is it done? Because I'm tired. It's done. Would you like to see it? There you go. Dad! What? You didn't like your portrait? Asil does it and he's an artist. When I do it, I'm a monster! Nobody appreciates my art! I do, my dear brother. Is it done? Mr. Levent is gone. Poor man. I'm so sorry! One last thing to do. Kill the girl, pin it on her mother, and she never gets out of that place. I've got the power of attorney. Everything he earned by killing our mother will all be ours. Can I do the girl? The girl is mine. I'm her father. Alin! Okay. Alin! Alin! Alin! ?zg?r! ?zg?r! Did you like your daughter's end? But I killed you! With this. But me, I killed your father. With this! Alin! ?zg?r! Alin! Don't be afraid. I'm a cop. Ms. Nisan! What's up? Don't you believe in ghosts anymore? I only changed your pills. And I walked around the house in my mother's guise. That's all. Poor fragile Nisan! You were all set to go crazy. I hung your portrait in the kitchen. And I whispered a few things in Alin's ear. Well, that was so nice of me. It looks like I did the hardest part. Nothing left for my brother to do! Brother? Poor Nisan! Do you still not understand? You don't, do you? Little Nisan! Where are you? You never looked at that painting carefully. If you had, you'd have seen it. We are her children. We are her revenge! You can't touch her! Don't be afraid. We're getting out of here. There you are! Alin! -Mom! -Alin! He's coming! My dear! Are you alright? Look at me! Are you alright? Look at me! Are you alright? Look at me. Go and hide in the closet. Quick! ?zg?r! ?zg?r, I loved you. I know you. You're not a killer. So, you know me? Could you ever imagine this? When we were kids, we were dragged from one police station to the next... those creepy night in orphanages, when nobody believed us... It felt like it would never end. I've loved many people. Had the painting of my mother not been put up for sale, I could even have loved you. But I loved Alin the most. It can't all be a lie! ?zg?r, we've been married for years! I'm married to my hatred. Don't you understand? I hate to paint. But I became a painter for this. I felt sick when I first saw you, but I married you. I always wanted to strangle that bastard of yours, but I became her father. But now, I'm free. Now I'm free! Oh, but this is no good. Where's my daughter? Don't touch her! Your beef is with me, not her. She's innocent. Don't touch her! She's innocent! Wasn't I innocent too when your father painted my mother's death? You should be thankful to my father! Had it not been for him... your mother would've been... a poor woman in some shitty village! She became the subject of the greatest painting thanks to my father. Fuck you! You're trying to tease me. Hilal ended up paying the price, though. Poor Hilal! What do you mean? Look. Hilal! What will you do now? You're not a father. You're not a painter. You're not a husband. And you're no longer a brother. Hilal! What will you do now? You're nothing. Mom! -My dear! -Mom! Alin. It's over. Mom! It's all over. We're leaving. Get up. Walk! Come with me! Look at me! Can you make it? Okay, we'll get out of here. Hold on. It's over. We'll make it. Press hard on your wound. Get up. We're going. Come on, hold on! We'll make it. Oktay, come on! We're leaving. Come on. Come with me. Oktay, it's over. There's one last thing to do. Stay here, okay? Stay here!
