Get him outta there, come on. Who told you to go in there? Who told you to go in there? - Frank, get the water. - God dammit! - Look at him! (men yell) He's okay. - How'd it go? Anything go wrong? - Everything. - I told you, we took too much-- - Oh, come on, will ya? - We took too much time after we were set up. - I don't wanna hear anything. You told me I was gonna have a ball of flames, I got a toy fire, what do you want from me? For Christ's sake, the car crash stunk, it was like a couple of old ladies crashing a damn car, and the head, you told me the head was gonna be on fire. That was no fire, I saw the headlights-- - I told you to glue dried! - Well, it's your job to make sure it doesn't. And the kid, the kid that got squibbed over there, that got shot in the back, he waited for the shot. He waited for it! I mean, who's gonna believe that? We're gonna have to do it over. Do you have another car? ("Jingo's Song" by Phil Everly) No, look at it!

Hey, I know you. You're Jingo, ain't ya? You used to go with Lucy Metcalf? - Yeah, that's right, Melba. - You remembered my name. Well, ain't this something? (chuckles) - What are you doing hitchhiking? - Going to work, I work mornings in the cafe up the road. Hey, what are you doing here? I thought you was in the movies? - Oh, yeah, I am, yeah, kind of. - Is it exciting? Did you get to do all those weird things with those movie stars? - Oh, sure, of course. - I guess you heard about your momma, huh? - Yeah, I just did, Homer Metcalf wrote me about it, that's why I came home. - That's it up there on the right. Yeah, she's in the nursing home where my stepmomma works. Black Oak, ain't what it used to be, no one seems to like anyone anymore. Come on in, have some coffee. - How about one to go? - You got it. - Oh, thanks. - Anything else I can do? - Everything's just fine. - See ya again, Jingo, thanks for the ride. - Hey, he your new boyfriend? - No, he's not my new boyfriend, now let go of my arm, Darby. - How come you never waited on me like that? How come I never got no curb service? - Darby, when are you gonna give up? Now let go of my arm, dammit! - Hey, why don't you let go of her arm? - Did you say something to me, Jack? Did you say something to me? Who the hell are you? Huh? Who the hell do you think you are? I'm talking to you, cowboy! - Look, I don't wanna fight, I've been driving all night. Okay? - (chuckles) You shoulda thought about that before! - Now look, I don't wanna fight, I told ya I didn't. - You got one. - That's it, that's it, hold it, hold it, now stop it! Hey, what's the matter with you guys? Knock it off. - Come on, let's go. - I'm sorry that happened, Jingo, I owe you one. - No problem, Melba. - [Cook] You alright, Jingo? - I'm okay. - Hey, it's nice seeing you again. How long you been in town? - About five minutes ("Jingo's Song" by Phil Everly) ♪ Never love a cowboy ♪ ♪ 'Cause cowboys never stay ♪ ♪ They're born to be wild and free ♪ ♪ Cowboys ride away ♪ (honks horn) - Hey, Mayberry! - Hey, (chuckles) Jingo! (rings bell) - Yes? - Hi, I'm here to see April Johnson, I'm her son. - Beulah, this is Mr. Johnson, he's April's son. We'll leave you alone now. (slow music) - Hi, Momma. I'm glad to see you. Now what we're gonna do is we're gonna take you outta this place, just as soon as you're able. We're gonna go back out to the country, just you and me, you're gonna get well, and we're gonna make this thing work. Shoot, this ain't no place for a hellcat like you, Momma. I mean, it's gonna set you back a little bit, I think come spring, you're gonna picking flowers, you're gonna be out there singing just like you used to. Homer wrote me about how the mining company got the farm, I don't want you to worry about that, 'cause I've been saving up and I got a pretty good little stake. It might be rough for a while, we're gonna make it work. I love you, Momma. I've missed you. It'll be alright. - Yes, yes, I heard you the first time, don't get so hot and bothered, everything's gonna be alright. If he makes any problems, I'll have him curling up like a spider on a hot stove. Goodbye. (knocks on door) - Oh, Jingo, mercy's sakes! Come on in, darlin', how are you? We wondered when you were gonna get back. Homer! - [Homer] Yeah, Momma? - Jingo, what a surprise, we've been wondering when you're gonna be coming back home. - Jingo, god damn! - Homer! Good to see ya, buddy! - It's good to see you! Oh my god, look at you. - Hey, you're looking good too, stud. - Aw. Hey, want a drink? - Do I want a drink? It's 10 o'clock in the morning and you're asking me if I want a drink? - Jingo, he drinks too much. - Momma, stop it. - I keep telling you that. - Momma, will you just stop it? How's the movie business? - Great, great. - [Homer] Great, really? - Well, if you wanna know the truth, I'm barely surviving out there, but, no, I like stunt work. - Stunt work? Boy, that's perfect for you, you always were crazy as a loon. - Oh, Homer. Jingo, can I fix you something? - No thanks. - Well, then I'm gonna go on in and fix my steak. - Hey, you still teaching? - Yeah, I'm still teaching. Yeah, still a drag. - Oh, you shoulda taken off when I did. - Nah, you only get one chance. - Aw, come on now, that's bullshit and you know it. - No, it ain't, it's the curse of the thinker. I've come to the conclusion that the only advantage to being a thinker is that when it comes time to die, I'll get that few extra days grace 'cause I'll be busy thinking whether or not it's a good idea. - What the hell are you talking about? - (chuckles) Nothing, nothing, we had some good times, huh? - Boy, we sure did. You got a girl yet? - No, but I'm looking. - Listen, boys, I'm going to the store and I'll be right back. - Alright, Momma. - How's your sister? - Lucy? She's great. You got my letter, huh? - Yeah, of course I got your letter, that's why I came home. I just saw my mother at the nursing home, ah, it's very upsetting, I wanna tell ya. I didn't realize she was in such bad shape. What do you know about it, Homer? - Well, Doc Roades said it was a blood condition, and he's the guy you oughta check with. - Yeah, I'm going to. Homer, why did she sell her farm? I mean, she loved that place. - Gee, I don't know, Jingo. Maybe when she got ill, the bills were too much for her. - Hey, listen, you wanna ride out there? I'm gonna ride out there right now and see what they've done to the place. - Sure, let me put some shoes on, I'll go with ya. - Where's Lucy? - Well, she was out here, there she is. - Hello, good lookin'. - Hello, Jingo. What brings you back? - Well, my mother for one, you for another. - Your mother maybe, but not me. Not me. - Don't I get a kiss? - I guess not. You a big Hollywood star yet? - Well, I guess if I was, I think you'd know about it by now. Let me ask you something, would I get a kiss if I was? Lucy, look, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Look, nothing was happening for me out there. I mean, I wasn't making a penny. I didn't wanna ask you out there to live the way I was living. - What happened to your letter writing, you break your fingers doing a stunt? - Well, why don't I tell you about it tonight? If we can have a drink? - I am going for a drink tonight, thank you. - Jingo, you ready to go? - Yeah, I'm ready. Bye, Luce. - See ya, Luce. - [Jingo] We'd like to take a look at the mine. - Well, you need a pass, you got one? - No. - You're gonna have to get one. - Who do I see about that? - Harrison Hancock, he's the guy in charge around here. - Harrison Hancock? Is he still around? - Yeah, I didn't wanna tell you this, Jingo, but, that's who Lucy's seeing. - Ah, Homer, no, you're kidding? - True. - So you gotta have a pass, huh? - That's right. - Okay, thanks a lot, buddy. - Ah, shit, Jingo, no! God! - We've got a break-in out here, get Mr. Hancock, fast! - Hard to believe that this used to be my house. I lived here all my life. - Hi. - Hey, what are you gonna do here? - Clearing out this garbage. - I don't want you to do that right now. - What do you mean? - I used to live here when I... - Well, I'll be damned. How you doin', Jingo? Morning, Homer. - Harrison. - Well, it's good to see you, boy, how's things out in Hollywoodland? - Why don't you cut the comedy, Harrison? - Alright, I will, that's a fair request, I'm gonna cut right to it, you're gonna get off here, in fact, I don't ever wanna see your face around here again. - Well, this is my mother's property, and my mother-- - Hey, Mr. Hancock said off, now that means off. - I'll tell you what, Harrison, why don't you try throwing me out yourself? - That's it, that's it. (screams) - [Homer] Jingo! (screams) - Don't get up, boy. I'll teach you a lesson you'll never forget. (groans) (police siren blares) - Alright, break it up. That's enough. Break it up, break it up. - He's trespassing, Sheriff, and this is private property. - You don't have a hair on your ass, do ya? - Hey, hold it! Hold it. Hold it now! - They tore down his house, Sheriff. - Just keep your nose out of it, school teacher. Jingo, for once in your life, use your head and get in the car and get outta here. Come on. Look, you listen up to me this one time, 'cause this is the only time I'm gonna tell you, number one, I don't like your ass, I never have, and there are a lot of people in this county that feel the same way, and number two, a lot of people in this county are happy to see Banner Mining Company here because a lot of 'em are eating better than they ever have before, and number three, if I catch you so much as spitting on the sidewalk, you're gonna be breaking rocks before you can turn around. Now get off this property! - Hey, Homer, you wanna tell Lucy I'll pick her up about eight o'clock? - We're doing all we can for her, Jingo, but you must understand that blood abnormalities are sometimes difficult to pinpoint. But we'll continue to run the blood tests until we discover the trouble. I'm sure we'll find out what it is. - What's the worst it could be, Doc? - To give an answer to that at this point would be pure speculation, but if she doesn't make a change for the better, we'll call in some specialists from the city. Put your shirt on. Don't you worry, Jingo, we're keeping close watch on her, she'll come around. - How much do I owe ya, Doc? - Nothing, but you keep outta trouble, 'cause next time's gonna cost you an arm and a leg. - Alright, thanks for patching me up. - Alright. - Thank you. - It's good to see you back, Jingo. - [Jingo] See ya, Doc. - Okay. - Bullard, where's Campbell and Bradley? - Must be crazy trying to figure out one of these things. Out patrolling, I reckon. - Well, you get 'em on the radio, you get 'em in here right away. - What's up? - Jingo Johnson's up, I wanna know where he is and what he's doing every minute of the day, you understand that? - Yes, sir, what do you want us to do, follow him around? - Bullard, what did I just say to you? - That you wanna know where he was and what he was doing. - And that's sound like I want you to do? - Follow him around. - Bingo, boy, I don't know how I get along without you. - Sheriff's Office to Campbell and Bradley. - Well, what are you gonna do, you got a place to stay? You wanna stay here on the couch? Come on. - What, with Lucy in the next room? That would drive me crazy. Nah, right now, I just wanna do some thinking, go out and see my mother out at the nursing home. - Come on, have a drink. Want a drink before you go? - Nah, I just wanna be alone, Homer. - You know it's done, Jingo. There's nothing you can do to get that land back. As for Lucy, I don't know. - Thanks, Homer, (chuckles) that really cheers me up. - Let me know where you're at. (slow music) - What are you getting all spruced up for? - (sighs) I'm just combing my hair, and you call that sprucing up? - Why don't you stay home sometimes? - Because you look like something the wolf ate and shit over a cliff, that's why. - Make me feel all warm and romantic when you say things like that. (door slams) - [Otis] Bullard? - [Bullard] Uh, yeah, Sheriff? - [Otis] Is that Johnson boy still there? - Um, yeah, he's still here, Sheriff. - You gotta go now. - Okay. I'll see ya later, Mom. (car starts) (Otis and Beulah scream) - Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. - What do you mean coming up on me like that? You're gonna give me cardiac arrest. - I'm gonna give you something, got any extra beds in the place? - Oh, you're ridiculous. - Gotta do it on the floor? - Oh, Otis, you turn me loose right now. She can hear every word you say, now come on, Otis. What has come over you? Otis! (knock on door) - [Mr. Finch] Miss Beulah, that you in there? (knocks on door) - Mr. Finch? You go on to bed now, it's past your bedtime. - Sounded like you was arguing with somebody. - [Beulah] Oh, (chuckles) I'm just talking to myself, you scoot now. - It ain't funny. I was a helluva lot older than she is before I started muttering to myself. - You are a crazy man, Otis Grimes. - I'll see you in a couple hours. - You sure will. - Who you looking for? - Bullard, he's been following me all over town. I think Grimes must think I'm gonna steal some hubcaps or something. - Listen, I found out a little bit about your momma's deal today. I don't know how much she got for selling the farm, but I do know that her transaction wasn't with the mining company, it was with the nursing home. - Well, who owns the nursing home? - Bryan Hancock. - Harrison's old man? - [Homer] That's him. - Well, hell, he's the guy I should be talking to then. - Well, he isn't gonna tell you anything. Besides, he's impossible to see. What do you got in your hand? - These are pills my mother's been taking, I took them from the nursing home. - Well, what are they? - I don't know, I'm gonna talk to the doc tomorrow and find out. - Well, if you wanna give me one, I'll have it checked out at the school in the lab first thing in the morning. - Okay. Homer, old man Finch and Anderson are at the nursing home too. - I didn't know that. - Well, see ya later. - Alright. (mysterious music) (men argue) - Tell him to get him out of town somehow! Offer him money or something! - Well, look at that. - Quick, turn off your headlights and your motor. - What's he doing here? - Shh! - Well, what's he doing here with the lights off and... Oh! - Honestly, sometimes you have chicken squat for brains. - Well, how was I supposed to know? - Well, there's a lot you don't know. - Oh yeah? - Yeah. In fact, Johnny Garman told me you was a cherry. - Well, that's a lie. - Well, there's nothing wrong with that. In fact, if I'd known that before, I probably wouldn't have made you wait so long. (Beulah moans) - [Beulah] Oh, Otis. Otis. (moans) What's wrong? - [Otis] Dammit, Beulah, can't you keep it down? You're breaking my concentration. - [Beulah] I'm sorry, Otis. - Oh, Melba. What if the sheriff should come out? - Oh, don't worry about him, it takes him forever. - Well, I don't know. - I do. - What? - Come on. Now look, you're a cherry, right? And everybody knows the first time has gotta be something special, I'm gonna give you something to remember. - What? - We're gonna do it in the sheriff's car. - Are you crazy? - [Otis] Come on. - [Beulah] Okay. There you go. Alright, ow, there. (moans) - They're in up there. (Beulah moans) - Oh, Melba. Oh, Melba. (Beulah moans) - [Melba] (chuckles) Bob! (police siren blares) - [Beulah] Otis? Oh god! (screams) - Quit crying and grab my pants! (police radio plays) (fires gun) What the hell is going on around here? - Oh, calm down, Sheriff, it ain't nothing! - Nothing? What have you been doing in my car? - Just horsin' around. - Horsin' around? Let me tell you something, youngster, this little girl here's underage, and the Lord don't take kindly to statutory rape. - Rape? - That's what I said, boy. - What happened? - I told you you had a problem child on your hands. - What do you mean? - She and Billie Bob were screwing in my car! - What? Why you get on in that house. Billie Bob, go on home. Go on, get! Don't you ever let me catch you hanging around this house ever again, you hear? Go on, scat. - I better get on back too. - It's early to head out. - No, no, I'm going home, I'll see you tomorrow. (honks horn) (Lucy screams) - Jingo! You son of a bitch! Do you wanna give me a heart attack? - Just being my charming self. - You're crazy. - Hey, where you headed? Oh, really? Boy, that's an amazing place, haven't been there in a long time. Oh yeah, it's a lovely day today, not a cloud in the sky. Hey, Lucy, would you hold on a minute, for Christ's sake? Come on, we gotta talk. - I'm mad, dammit! You scared the hell outta me back there. - Hey, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to do that. - No, you're not. You're never sorry about anything. - Hey, Lucy, we gotta talk, you know we do. (sighs) - (chuckles) What do you want? You don't understand. I don't wanna spend my life driving around in a pickup truck. - [Jingo] What is that supposed to mean? - Well you hadn't exactly set the world on fire, have ya? I don't know, once I thought I might get outta this place, and I thought you might make it possible. - Well, is that what you felt for me? - You know better than that. You know I loved you. - That's all gone now? - We've grown apart. I'm not saying that I don't care for you, I just, I can't see myself washing clothes, and doing the dishes, and watching television for the rest of my life, I can't. - What do you see yourself doing? - You'd laugh at me. - I'm not gonna laugh at you. - Yeah, you would. - No, I'm not. - I wanted to be an architect. And you know, I know I could've been. I know I could've been good. I had a vision of this building, it was a big, beautiful building, and I would've designed it all myself, I woulda been good. You don't think that? (Jingo chuckles) You think it's funny? - No, I don't think it's funny. - You're laughing! And you know why? Because the only thing that you think I'm capable of doing is having kids for you and taking care of you. - Lucy, Lucy, let me ask you something, do you think Harrison Hancock cares anything about your dreams? Because I can tell you right now he doesn't care at all, nothing. - No! I know he doesn't care, but by god, he's a way outta here, he's a chance to do something and be somebody, be the person I was meant to be. - What, is that what counts, having a way out, is that it? I mean, Lucy, you don't seem to care whether or not there's any kind of love in it, or what kinda creep you're sleeping with, or anything. Those things don't make any difference to you anymore, I don't know what the hell has happened to you. - You know what's happened? You know what's happened? I've grown up. - Lucy, you don't know what the hell you're doing. I feel sorry for ya. - Don't you waste your sympathy on me, 'cause you're gonna need every bit you can get for yourself, every bit. - Lucy, where you going? - I'm going home, I have a date for the dance and I have to get ready. - Lucy. (kids yell) (snores) Melba. - Yeah? - I want a potato. - How do you want it? - Just raw, out of the kitchen. - You don't want it cooked or nothing? - Mm-mm. (Bullard snores) Thank you. - Bye. (revs engine) - Hey, Paul! (upbeat music) (car honks horn) Hello, Paul. - Jingo, I want you to pull that car off this road! (police siren blares) Jesus. Damn you! (upbeat music) (police siren blares) (siren winds down) (car sputters) (horn honks) Ow! You got a lotta gall, you get outta there! - Hey, what's the matter here, Bullard, you outta gas? - No, I'm not outta gas, you son of a bitch. - Well, why don't we just jump in my car and I'll give you a ride back to town. - You'll give me a ride? Shit, I oughta arrest you for speeding! - I'm sorry. - You know how fast you were going? - I'm sorry. - Sorry, sorry, shit, you're always sorry. - I promise I'll never do it again, Bullard. Come on now, shake. - Where'd you learn to do all that fancy driving anyway? - Well, I don't know what the hell you're talking about. - You're harder to catch than a greased pic. (chuckles) - Bullard, you know I always had a lotta respect for you, and I always felt that you were a helluva good old boy. - Well, hell, I always thought a lot of you too, Jingo, the trouble is you're always in trouble. (chuckles) - Hey, if I'm such a good old boy, then what the hell you doing following me all over town like that? - I don't know what you're talking about. - Ah, come on Bullard. Look, I'll tell you what I'll do, I'll make you a deal. - You're gonna make me a deal? - I'll get that car started for you if you tell me why Grimes is having you follow me around like that. - Shit, you can't start this car no better than I can. Well. - There you go, Bullard. - God damn, Jingo. (chuckles) I oughta shove this son of a bitch right down your throat, wop you upside the head, boy. - Now listen, I gotta know what the hell's going on here, Bullard, I gotta know why Grimes is making you follow me around like that, now we got a deal. - All I know is he said to let him know if I saw you go anywhere near Bryan Hancock, Beulah Barnes, or Doc Roades. - Doc Roades, huh? - That's what he said. Hey, Jingo, what'd you do anyway? Might be best if you just made a clean breast of it and confessed. - I don't know what the hell I did. - Hey, don't you go telling Otis that I told you anything now, 'cause he'll clean my plow. - No, I won't do that. (honks horn) - That's it for the day, Alma. Now, let's you see here next Wednesday, same time. Now you do everything I say and there's nothing to worry about. - Okay. - What's so important? - Doc, did you know that Mr. Anderson and Mr. Finch are at the nursing home too? - So? - Why, don't you think that's a little peculiar? - Why? (chuckles) - Well, they're neighbors of my mother's, and they're at the nursing home too. - Well, is that what you came in to tell me, that two men that used to be neighbors of your mother are now at a nursing home? - No. Doc, what kinda pill is this? - You know, after you left here yesterday, I got to remembering that time at Bass Lake where we caught that eight-pounder. You remember that? - (chuckles) Yeah. - It's an antibiotic, Jingo, why? - That's the pill they're giving my mother there at the nursing home. - Well, it better be, I prescribed it. Where'd you get it? - I took it from the nursing home. - You're really worried about your mother, aren't you? - Yeah. - I'll tell you what, if she doesn't show any improvement, we'll call in one of those high-priced specialists next week, alright? How about you and me going fishing? You know, I made me up some new flies, we'll see how good they are. How about it? - Let me give you a call. - Great, we'll set a time. - Okay. (intense music) - Jingo, Jingo, I'm here to tell you you're in trouble. Now it's not too serious yet, but nevertheless, it's trouble. Now you're sniffing around, you're always sniffing around. - You tell me why I shouldn't, Harrison, I'd like to know. - You know what you're gonna find out? If you continue to irritate me, you're gonna find out that I can be a very mean person, that's what you're gonna find out. You understand? - Yeah, I understand. - Are you sure? - Yeah, I'm sure. - I take it you and I understand one another. Huh? - Yeah, I think so. - Well, that's wonderful. And you'll pardon me for being so violent. Now, that's a warning, the next time, I'm gonna pour kerosene on you and set you on fire. - I can't believe I ever let you talk me into this. - Well, Bryan, life does funny things sometimes. I mean, take, for instance, you and me, we got a deal, and your end of it is to make me rich, and I'm gonna hold you to that. Now what about it? - No, I want alternatives. - There aren't any alternatives. - If you go against my wishes, it will be very unfortunate. Otis, there is rich and then there is rich, you'll never be truly rich, takes much more than money, much more. Harrison? Harrison? - Yes, what is it? - I wanna talk to you. - Well, do you have to bellow like that? I'm not one of your servants, you know? - You needn't remind me what you are, are you going out? - Yes, I am. - Can you stay for dinner? - No, may I go now? - [Bryan] What happened with the Johnson boy? - Well, I don't think you're gonna have to worry about him anymore. - Did he accept the offer? - Well, everybody has a price, Daddy, just like you always said. - I'm in no mood for your sarcasm. - When are you gonna tell me why Jingo's got you and Grimes so jittery? - When you grow up and learn to respect your responsibilities. - Gee, Daddy, why do you like me so much? - Don't talk to me like that. You've been enough of a burden to me. Don't make it any more than I can bear. Harrison, don't you dare turn your back on me! Harrison, do you hear me? Someday your insolence is going to carry you too far. (door slams) (country music) - Evening, let's hear it for the band now, what do you say? (crowd cheers and applauds) Are you folks having a good night? I say we just keep it going for you now, why don't y'all go ahead and take your seats, and we got something coming on now that's really gonna curl your hair.

Hey, I'll be right there in the back. - In the back. - Billie Bob, listen, my car is right over there, and it's in the glove compartment. - Thanks. - Okay. (band plays kazoos) (crowd cheers and applauds) - Thank you, thank you very much. Our names are Tiffany and Debra, we're gonna do "Stars and Stripes Forever". (band plays kazoos) - Harrison. I just wanted to apologize. - Who are you kidding? - No, really, I just wanted to apologize. I've been thinking it over and I realize I've been out of line. Thing is, I've been so damn suspicious of people since I got back in this town, that you made me realize that I was wrong, and that I had no business in butting in other people's affairs. I don't know, I guess if I caused enough heartache to make you do what you did to me today, then I apologize. - Do you really mean that? - Yeah, I do. - Well, hell, Jingo, look, I'm sorry I had to put you through all that. I was doing my job, wasn't anything personal. - No, no, Harrison, I know that, I know that. - You know, this is funny, because when we were kids, we never did get along, but, well, now, hell, we're grown up, so no hard feelings. You son of a bitch. - Get up. You ain't very tough without your boys, are you, Harrison? I wanna know what the hell is going on, or so help me God, dammit, I'm gonna nail your ass, do you hear me? - I swear, I don't know! I was only following orders! - Whose orders? Grimes? Hancock? Whose orders? - I was supposed to offer you money! - You forgot! - 5,000, all you gotta do is leave town! You're crazy! - That's about enough. - Alright, what is it? What are you sticking around for? What, is it Lucy, is that it? Is that what you're so sore about? You want her, I'll walk away from her! You can take her if you want! - I'm not yours to give away, Harrison. Would you take me home, Jingo? - You tell your old man I'm gonna nail his ass, Harrison, him and Sheriff Grimes. My shotgun's stolen. God! - [Mr. Parks] You can stay as long as you like, Jingo, as long as you like. - [Jingo] Thank you, Mr. Parks. - You haven't said a word since we left the dance. What are you thinking about? - Nothing. - Is it that I went with Harrison? Jingo, I know what it is. - Do you? - Mm-hmm. You think your Madonna's been tainted. - My what? - That's what it is, isn't it? I suppose you haven't touched a woman since you've been gone? - That's right. - You lie. (Jingo chuckles) - So help me God, Lucy, I've been holding out for you for the past year and a half. - Well, I didn't sleep with Harrison either. - You know, you're really something else, you know that? Do you actually expect me to believe that? - I love you, Ralph. - What did you call me? Huh? - Ralph. That's your name, isn't it? - Don't you ever call me that again. - Well, why? Ralph. - I'm warning you. - What'll happen? - Severe consequences. - (chuckles) Like what? - I don't know, I'll think of something though. - You better think fast, 'cause your Madonna's getting impatient. - Damn, you haven't changed a bit, have you? - Neither have you, you're still a spoiled brat. - That is the last straw. (slow music) - I've always loved you, Jingo. I've always loved you. - Well, if he's not home, where is he? Doesn't the sheriff tell his deputies where he's gonna be? Don't you keep in contact with each other? - Sheriff, Beulah Barnes just called and said that Jingo's mother died this morning. She sounded really upset. (mysterious music) Sheriff? Sheriff? - Where in the hell have you been? Oh. Your mother didn't receive a dime for selling her farm, Jingo. - How's that possible? - Made a deal with the nursing home for free medical care. They promised her they'd take care of her for the rest of her life. - No, she wouldn't do that. - No, if she woulda looked. That pill you gave me, I had that pill checked and they told me that that was Chloromycetin. It attacks the white blood cells, creates a blood disorder, it causes the body to waste away. That's probably what's happening to your mom. - No, no, Doc Roades, he... Homer, are you sure? - I'm positive, Jingo. - What are you two talking about? - Lucy, we've been blind, we haven't paid any attention to the people in this town. Hancock, Doc Roades, probably Sheriff Grimes, in fact, I'm sure Sheriff Grimes is involved, and they've been conspiring to steal the land from these people. They get 'em in that nursing home and they make 'em sicker. They make a deal with 'em, they give 'em free medical service for their land, like they did your momma, then they turn around and sell it to the mining company for a bigger profit. - I'm gonna get my mother. - I'll go with you, you want me to? - No, Homer, stay right here now. - Jingo, bring her here, and we'll put her up in my room. - Okay, we'll do that. Where's my mother? - April Johnson? - Yeah. - I'm sorry, she passed away early this morning. (intense music) (intense music) - A bit early to come calling, isn't it? What are you doing with that shotgun? - I'm going to use it. - What do you mean? - I'm gonna clean up this whole stinkin' mess. - What are you talking about? - Well, first, I'm gonna take Jingo's shotgun here, I'm gonna kill the good doctor, and I'm gonna kill his nurse Beulah, that gets rid of two people that might open their mouths, and then I'll... (chuckles) What is the matter, Hancock? - You're crazy. - And then I'm going to produce this shotgun as evidence, and I'm gonna let everybody know how Jingo lost his mind and went on a killing spree, - You can't do that! - and then I'm gonna find the son of a bitch and I'm gonna kill him too! - If I thought you were serious, I'd turn you in myself. - What did you say? I don't think I heard you. - Stop acting like a fool, Grimes. You're not frightening me. - You'd do that? You'd turn me in? - If I thought you'd do that, yes, of course I would. - You son of a bitch! (fires gun) - Oh god, oh. (fires gun) (intense music) - Beulah? Beulah? Are you in here, baby? Beulah, I just wanna talk to you! Come on, Beulah, where are you? I swear I'm not gonna hurt you, I love you too much! Just this morning, I told Sadie that we were through! Beulah? If you can hear me, believe what I say, everything's gonna be alright if you just don't tell about what you saw! Beulah? I'll see you later, Beulah! (sobs) - I don't guess that anybody really cares, but, I loved him. He promised to take care of me, I just couldn't live with it. - Bullard, what the hell's going on? - Jingo, Sheriff Grimes, he shot and killed Mr. Hancock and his son. I know now why he wanted you outta town here, Beulah was a witness. - Where's the sheriff now? - I don't know, I wish I knew, Beulah said he lit outta here right after it. - [Otis] Bullard, this is Grimes, come on in. Bullard, dammit, this is an emergency! - Go ahead, Sheriff. - I want you to get over to the Hancock house, Jingo Johnson has just gone crazy, he killed Mr. Hancock and he killed Harrison. - He what? - [Otis] That's right, he killed 'em in cold blood. - Where are you, Sheriff, are you there? - I'm on my way to the mine to see if I can find some men. If you see that son of a bitch, you shoot him on sight. Don't ask him any questions, just kill him, it's a double homicide, do you understand that? - Sheriff, this is Jingo. I'm gonna make it easy on you, Sheriff, you wait there, I'll be right over and you can arrest me yourself. - [Otis] Bullard, you put the cuffs on him, you understand? Arrest him! Bullard? Bullard? - [Bullard] Bradley, this is Bullard, you and Campbell round up the Doc and get out to the mines pronto. Sheriff's out there now. (intense music) (mysterious music) (intense music) (fires gun) (intense music) (fires gun) (fires gun) (mysterious music) - Jingo, take a look around, there's no way outta here except for over me, and that ain't going to happen. (fires gun) - Jingo? (fires gun) (fires gun) (fires gun) - You should've taken the money and left, Jingo. Now it's too late. (car drives over rocks) (intense music) (gunfire) - [Deputy] You better let him up or I'll put one through you! (slow music) - You take care now, you hear me? You pretty thing, you. Oh, Jingo, (chuckles) you take care of my little girl. - Yeah, I'll take good care of her. Well, are you gonna come see us, Professor? - Maybe. I'm happy for you, Jingo. Baby. - Homer, you take care. - You too, sis. - Bye, Mom. - Bye, darlin', drive carefully now. - [Lucy] We will. - Bye, Lucy. - [Lucy] Bye, Bullard. - [Virginia] Bye, darling. - What's wrong? (honks horn) - Bullard, you son of a gun!
