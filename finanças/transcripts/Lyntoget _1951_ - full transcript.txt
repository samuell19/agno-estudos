On April 27, 1949 - the following message was printed in a Copenhagen newspaper under the header: "Dangerous criminal has fled prison. Horsens, Tuesday night.” "Around 8 P.M. yesterday evening the alarm was sounded, -" "because a prisoner had escaped from the State Prison's 'Bjerre annex'" "A prisoner, 24 years old, had succeeded in breaking the lattice in his cell and jump," "The escape was discovered moments later.” "The prisoner is a dangerous criminal, sentenced to life for political crime," "he was born in Hellerup." "The Police has embarked on a large-scale search.” The story, which you are about to be told, is based exactly on this newspaper article. But the story as well as its characters are fictitious - and has no relation whatsoever to dead or living real-life persons or events. EDITOR IN CHIEF Yes! … Come. What is it? Police Commissioner Block has quit his position. Nonsense... - What are you telling me?! - I've seen a copy of the telegram He departs from Tirstrup airport in 45 minutes. That's a sensation! Then why the heck haven't you left instead of wasting your time here?! Because he won't tell me anything, but you've known him for many years... - Is my vehicle ready? - Yes. Block, what are you doing in Copenhagen? Why have you sought your leave? That's none of your business. Don't write anything about it. When a man of your stature seeks his leave, there must be a good reason. Of course there is, but it's not for the public to know. After all these years, can't you tell an old friend what pains you? I will tell you… But I don't want it printed. Alright. I'll join you for Copenhagen. I'm going to Copenhagen... I'll buy a ticket onboard. - Should I keep an open space? - No, not a word. See you tomorrow. - Something to read? - No, thanks. You've been my best friend for many years, so it is only fair, - that you, as the one closest to me, or as the only, gets to know. Don't worry. You can place trust in me. Why have you sought your leave? At 5 A.M. this morning my phone rang… Block. Has he escaped the State Prison? Bring a car here in 10 minutes. Yes, we'll go to Horsens. I spoke to superintendent, Carl Rasmussen. The prison staff is hunting the escapee. Apparently, he jumped the wall. He had been transferred to the annex building due to space issues. I know him well. I had the case. He doesn't hold back for anything. Drive safely! We wouldn't want to be held over for speeding. I got him in 1945 in Southern Jutland, right after the Capitulation. He tried to shoot me. He hates my guts. Unfortunately, there were almost no traces, the escapee was gone and left. We used tracking dogs, but when we met a lake, all tracks disappeared. OK. But why are you seeking your leave? You don't think he will hunt you down? No no no, if only that was the case... About an hour ago my phone rang. - Who was it? - I'll tell you later, I'm telling the story now, as I'm visioning it. - I'll begin with the train. - Which train? The express train leaving from Aarhus to Copenhagen at 7.05 P.M. Yes, what about it? On that train, this night three people, - who, this morning, didn't know of the others' existence. Who were they? One of them you know, that was the escapee, Henning Knudsen. - Yes, he escaped, that I know. - Now, listen… Knudsen was interned in State Prison. He is a war criminal of the worst kind, - former SS and Gestapo man, Sentenced to death for murder, but pardoned to lifetime in prison. Intelligent, kind of charming, but totally reckless and unscrupulous. In prison, apparently he was quiet and sociable. Now we know why. He was preparing the escape which has now taken place... Jens! Jens! Jens! Jens! - Can you give me a lift to Aarhus? - I'm going to Harested. - Can I join you? - Yes. Perfect, thank you! Another person in my story is a young girl, - who, this morning, were going to Copenhagen. She took a bus to Aarhus… Goodbye to you. Please write, as soon as you arrive in Copenhagen. I will! Goodbye, Kirsten. Take care. During the long time in prison - every detail in the escape plan was carefully thought out and prepared. Thanks for the ride. Pardon me. - You got yourself a nap. - Hopefully, I wasn't snoring? Not at all, miss. Aren't you afraid that the suitcase should fall on your head? I don't hope so. There are bottles in it. Then let me take it. I have space for it. - It doesn't bother you? - Not at all. It's nice to have something to hold on to. Anyways, we'll soon be in Aarhus. No, there's still an hour. Oh... Perhaps you're living in Aarhus? No, I'm taking the express train bound for Copenhagen tonight. Oh, I'll also try to catch that too. Then we can even travel together. You see, when we're releasing a description of an escaped criminal, - we always assume that he's alone. But Henning Knudsen is sly. All day he tried to stay with the girl he met on the bus. - Let me take the suitcase. - No, thanks, I'll handle it myself. - Let me take it, it's not heavy. - Oh, you shouldn't care to help... Oh, it's not far... Let me buy you a cup of coffee. Oh, thank you. But first I'll have to go to the bank before it's closing. Oh, you're going to the bank. Meanwhile, I'll try to get a ticket for the train. I'll wait for you on the train station until you get back. And now for the third person in the drama... The drama? Yes, the drama. He's a young bank clerk, who, as on any other day… calmly and responsibly was fulfilling his duties. Folmer Jacobsen. - Number 736. - Yes. - How would you like it? - 10 kroner notes, please. - Here you are. - Thank you. There's no doubt that Knudsen had thought out his plan, carefully. He wanted to take another person's identity by stealing his passport,- his money and, if possible, his tickets so he could leave the country, He knew that a travel agency would be ideal for him to realise his plans. - Here you are. - Thank you very much. Henriksen, could you take over for me? I will, but it's only 12.40 P.M. I know, but I have to be somewhere that's also closing at 1 P.M. OK, I'll take it. - Thank you. Mr. Jørgensen. 30 kroner. Oh, you scared me. - Where have you been? - Here, at the train station. - Did you get a ticket? - No, the queue was too long. Let's go to the travel agency. I will buy one there. Oh, I have to get my ticket there, too. - I'm here to pick up my tickets. - Just a moment, please take a seat. - Thank you, but I'm in a hurry. - Just a moment. My name is Ebba Mogensen. I ordered a ticket for the express train departing at 7.05. - Mogensen? - Yes. Miss, perhaps you have a seat next to her's? - Let me check. - Thanks. - Here you are, here's your tickets. - Thank you. Express train for Copenhagen, 1. Class. Yes. It's leaving at 7.05, right? Here's your passport, including both Spanish and Argentine visas. Thank you. Great. Here are your plane tickets Tomorrow: Copenhagen to Paris. Paris - Barcelona and Barcelona - Buenos Aires. That'll be 2,730.60, please pay at the counter. Here you are, here's your passport. You won't get far without it. Thank you very much. I have found two window seats right across each other. Wonderful. Thank you. - Please pay at the counter. - Thank you. I think I've seen that man earlier today. Hmm? Here you are. - Are you done? I'll lock the safe. - Just a moment. - I'll lock it when I leave. - Thank you, then I'll leave now. - Have a nice weekend. - You too. Oh, it's you, mr. cashier. Yes, I'm a little late today. I counted wrong. I won't disturb, then. Then you'll please remember to lock after you leave. - Have a nice weekend, - You too, Nielsen. He had always been dutiful and honorable. But from this afternoon onwards, he is a simple thief. You sound so serious. Who is this young man? It's my son. It's Jørgen. It's my own fault. I was too selfish in my love for him. I wanted to keep him for myself. About a month ago he came to me an afternoon... You aren't telling me that you want to quit your good and safe job, just to be silly and travel the world? Silly? I have always wanted to travel. It was only to please you that I took that damn job at the bank. I wanted to go to Texas or Argentina, buy a farm - live in God's nature... Not in a bank behind latticed windows. You're talking about the bank as if it were a prison. It is! We are there for a lifetime. Just waiting for our superintendent to die! The world is out there, wide and beautiful, so they say. But what do you know about that? Where have you learned about that nonsense? From you, dad, you yourself once travelled the world. When you entered the police force, it was to experience the adventures? Maybe. But I will not offer you my savings for that. OK... But I will certainly find my own way some day. By the time the express train was leaving for Copenhagen... three people met at the train station… The 7.05 express train for Copenhagen has arrived at track number 1. Would you please go in advance? I forgot to buy cigarettes. - You're paying for the dinner. - If it isn't too dry. Express train for Copenhagen departs in 3 minutes. Oh, that was the last minute. Lucky I caught it. I'll help you lifting the suitcase. It looks like we'll have it all by ourselves. It's so nice that it's window seats. Oh, it's so exciting! Yes, very exciting… Do you want to eat now or wait? Now. In two hours we'll be on the ferry. Let me. Here you are. While you unpack, I'll just go for a walk. I've never travelled by express train. - Have you? - No, never. Such speed already, huh? Hello, buster! Come, Birthe, girl. Hello, may I see your ticket? Thank you. Do you have a seat reservation? Thank you very much. Here you are. When do we reach the ferry? At 9.13 P.M. Oh, that's wonderful food. - Please do eat. - Can I take the one with beef? - Shouldn't you take your hat off? - Oh… of course. Yummy, it tastes wonderfully. Like a tiger, Henning Knudsen waited for the right moment - to jump his prey. There was no way back anymore. He had to have that passport and those tickets, whatever the costs. It was the way to freedom. The only way available to him. No chances could be taken. Everything had to be cold-bloodily thought out. - Thank you, that tasted wonderfully. - My mother made it. There's nothing wrong, is there? What? No… Now I want to go for a walk. I'll have a look around. - Hurry a bit! - Wait, you're not commanding me? No, no… Sorry. I just really enjoy your company. Thank you. I'll hurry. - Hello. - Hello. - Well, we'll meet again. - Yes. Yes, it was at the travel agency. - Want to smoke? - No, thanks. Don't you want to join me? Yes, but I only have a 3. class ticket. That doesn't matter, does it? Please. - Don't you want to sit? - Yes, thank you. - You're also travelling? - Yes. - To Copenhagen… for a seminar. - I see. - You're travelling way further. - Yes. Wasn't it Argentina? Yes… it was. It must be so nice to get out and experience something. -Yes. - I wish it was me! What are you doing over there? Just a vacation? No. I am planning on buying a little farm. Are you a farmer? Farmer…? Yes. You certainly don't look it. - Oh, there's the Little Belt Bridge. - Yes. - I've been thinking so much about you all day. - Me? Yes. I became envious hearing about that wonderful journey. About the great big country, you're travelling to. - Aren't you excited? - Excited… yes, of course. I'm looking forward to start anew on something which sparks my interest. Every minute was costly. Every minute had to be exploited, - if his plan were to succeed, and the road to freedom stood open. When are we in Odense? - In about half an hour. - Thank you. Now I know! You're from the bank! I knew, I had seen you before. You stood by the counter and paid me the money. In the bank? Oh no, you're a farmer… Then I don't know, where I've seen you before. Sorry for interrupting... The conductor is coming. It's best that you return to your seat. Yes, I must be going. - Goodbye, and thanks for the talk. - Goodbye. Oh, you're so clumsy with that passport. Second time today. - Bye. - Bye. The consequences of the deed, he had just done, - began to dawn on him. He had tangled himself in his first contradiction. - Go ahead. I'll be there in a minute. - Yes. The young lady forgot her bag. Oh… I haven't seen it. Maybe it's on the floor? Where am I? What is this? What happened? The suitcase slipped and hit you on the head. A big blow. You were completely gone. It hurts! I have a terrible nausea. Can I have a glass of water? I'll take you to the restroom to get you some water. - Yes, please. - Do you want me to help? I feel ill again. There's an empty compartment right here. - Don't we stop in Odense? - Not until the ferry. Conductor, the toilet door is jammed. - Oh, let me have a look at it. - Thanks. The money shouldn't be found on him. He had to hide it some place, - where he could find it later. - Oh, I've been sleeping. - Yes. I ate the rest of the food like you told me to. Well done of you! Then we can throw out the box. No! You can't throw stuff out the window. No, you're right, it would look ugly. - Now we must soon be in Nyborg. - Yes... I'll go out for a moment. We're soon on the ferry. What happened? Are you sick? - Where's my briefcase? - It's in your compartment. They're gone. Money, passport and tickets. He's taken it all. Whom? The guy who attacked me. Have you been attacked? - Conductor … - No! We have to report it, call the police. No! Not the police. - Here you are. - Thank you. Why mustn't the police know? Because... the money that's been stolen from me is not mine. What do you mean? I took it this evening, from the bank where I'm a clerk. So it was me you saw this morning. Oh, no, what have you done?! I've abused a trusted position. I took 90,000 in Danish and foreign banknotes. Nobody would discover it until Monday, and then I'd be gone. Everything was planned out, but not that the thief would be robbed. Yes, but how did it happen? It was the guy who picked you up earlier. Him?! … No. But he must be here on the ferry. Look, there he is. It's him. Yes, yes… - What are we going to do? - We have to catch him. I'll threaten him with the police, they don't know that the money is stolen. Come. You'd better stay here. Yes… you're probably right. I feel terrible. He must be found before the ferry hits shore. Don't worry. I'll look for him. Stay here. I want to speak with you, Henning Knudsen. What about? I want you to hand back that which you have stolen. What if I don't? What happens then? I'll go straight to the captain. Let go! … Let go! Help! - Help! - Hansen, come. If you utter a word about this, I'll smash in your face! - What's happening here? - My girlfriend passed out. I see... and it is your girlfriend? Why, yes, of course. It's not true, it's… Oh, that gentleman was approaching you? - What are you saying! - I say follow me to the captain. - Hell no, I won't! - Yes, you will! … Hansen! This gentleman should be taken to the captain. So, will you please leave? I'll be back in a minute, miss. Where did you get that? The money … and the tickets. He gave it to you voluntarily? Oh, voluntarily… He tried to strangle me. Thank god, the helmsman arrived. - Did you tell him who he was? - No. Why not? For your sake. I was probably too candid with the young lady... But I'd had too much to drink… I didn't know what I was doing. Oh. Come into my cabin. You'll stay there until we reach Korsør. - Then we'll figure out what to do. - Yes. What are you going to do now? I have to hand back the money. - I'll go call my father. - Then I'll wait in the compartment. - Where's the telephone? - Go to the radio room upstairs. - Just behind the captain's cabin. - Thank you. Jørgen called me from the ferry and told me everything. I'm terribly sorry to hear... But I still don't understand why you sought your leave? Well, if I'm a policeman, I must arrest him. How did that call end? That's why I'm here. It was interrupted. Thank God, we're soon in Copenhagen, and we can be at the central station when the train arrives. - Please fasten your seatbelts. - Yes. He's not with the train. I don't understand. Conductor… A young man was travelling first class. - 28 years, dark hair, brown eyes. - Is the name Block? Yes, he's my son. Did something happen to him? - Yes, he's had a concussion. - Concussion? How did that happen? I don't know the circumstances. But he has been brought to another platform. An ambulance had been telegraphed. - Thanks. - Thank you very much. I'm the father of the young man. How is he? The doctor doesn't think it's too bad. You can enter. He's in room 332. I'll wait outside. Yes? I'm Jørgen's father. I know who you are. - How could this happen? - He got sick on the train. Yes, he called me, but we were interrupted. What happened? I thought about it all, and it was crazy that we didn't tell, - that the escapee was in the captain's cabin. I wanted to tell your son about it. But something terrible had happened… Only we knew who he was, so he wasn't carefully looked after. Meanwhile, he took a chance and fled the cabin... ...in a paper we realised who he was: The wanted Henning Knudsen. No… I bought the tickets using my own savings. I'll hand the money back to the bank. I'll take the full responsibility. Hello?! Take it easy, I don't want any trouble. What do you want? Give me the passport and your tickets. You won't need it now. Then you can keep the money which you will need now, you dirty little thief! You give me a chance, and I'll give you one. When we reach Knudshoved, I'll jump the ship and swim to shore. - Want to do business? - No! Never! Run for help! Man overboard! Ready by starboard lifeboat. Do you have the strength to go now? Yes, I believe so. I have the money here. On the train, he passed out again, and he was brought here. I'll go and speak a bit with the doctor. Are you in pain? - How is he? - He has just gained consciousness. Can you get a car, so we can return to Aarhus immediately? Good that your father came. Yes, but where did he go? He went to speak with the doctor. Everything will be fine. I'll join you. The doctor has allowed me to take you home if we travel directly by car. We have to go to Aarhus to close this case… Come, little lady. Come with me. Before dawn, the money shall have been returned to where it was taken. Let's hope nobody has heard anything. Remember, the call from the ferry could have been tapped. We have to hurry. Father … can you forgive me? Yes. The money must be returned before the bank opens. When the director arrives, you must tell him all, and we'll see what happens. No man can go unpunished, doing what you have just done. One day, again the sun will will shine on you. Then you should go out into this world which you so wanted to see. Maybe you can find someone who wants to join you, - and another one who has finally learned so much, to want to pay for the tickets. Please stop the car. I want to sit in front. Why did you want to sit with me? I think those two will get something out of this trip. Why are you so grumpy? Oh, I'm just a bit upset that I promised you not to write a word about this...
