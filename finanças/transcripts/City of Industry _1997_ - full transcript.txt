Without me telling you about that, You may as well start with the phone book. Okay. It's a deal. - Over there. - What? -Uncle Luke. It was after something big. Jorge went down to Dallas. I picked him up at the airport. He had two suitcases. I dropped him off in the alley in the back And waited at that burger stand for about an hour. When Jorge came back, he was empty-handed. When I asked where he was, he said, "visiting uncle Luke." Three days later, I find him stashing money in shoeboxes. - The payoff. - Yeah. It wasn't the last time they did business with that guy. Luke's their fence. So, what are you gonna do? Send your kids to college. You figure it out? When? Tomorrow. Skip's downed the load. He's waiting for his money. That gives me a window. - What do you want me to do? - Stay out of it. When I kill Skip, there'll be a body. Nothing to tie you in. You and the kids leave town anyway.

Luke: Where the hell are you? This place. Used to work out here. Why? Everything cool? Don't bother coming for your money. Why the fuck's that? Because it's not here anymore. It's gone. Luke, what the hell are you talking about? Gone. Egan took it. Bullshit! I downed the merchs to you! You owe me the money! If he stuck you up, that is your fucking problem! Fuck you and fuck your money! This guy knew you. He knew the money was for you. Before you go crazy, I know where he is. Where? I'm not paying you any more money. You want your money, you get it. You get it from him. How did he get to you? Why are you asking me? It was your crew. All right, I'm moving. Egan's camped out at some dump on Roscoe in the valley. He's got the money.
