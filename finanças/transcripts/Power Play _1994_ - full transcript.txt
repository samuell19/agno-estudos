A LITTLE PIECE OF CANADA. #2: PR. YOU'RE ALL IN CUSTOMER-POWERED BUSINESSES. IT'S INSTANT PUBLICITY FOR THE WHITE KNIGHTS WHO SAVE THE BLADES.

(Cody) I NEVER HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO GO FORWARD AT A CRUSADE LIKE THIS, BUT I WISH I HAD. MANY OF YOU HAVE COME FROM GREAT DISTANCES TO BE WITH US TONIGHT. I BELIEVE EVERY ONE OF USE IS HERE BECAUSE THE HOLY SPIRIT HAS LEAD US. EVER BEEN TO ONE OF THESE? I'M STRICTLY A "C AND E" GUY... CHRISTMAS AND EASTER. WHEN BILLY GIVES YOU THE INVITATION TO GIVE YOUR HEART TO CHRIST, REALLY CONSIDER WHOSE TEAM YOU'RE PLAYING FOR. GOD'S LOVE IS THE GREATEST POWER IN THE UNIVERSE. IT CHANGED HISTORY. IT CHANGED ME. AND NOTHING... NOTHING CAN OVERCOME IT. (Applause)... THANK YOU. (Billy Graham) IT WAS NOT HUMAN WEAKNESS THAT KEPT HIM ON THE CROSS. JESUS SAID, "I LAY DOWN MY LIFE THAT I MIGHT TAKE IT AGAIN. NO MAN TAKES IT FROM ME, BUT I LAY IT DOWN OF MYSELF. I HAVE POWER TO LAY IT DOWN, AND I HAVE POWER TO TAKE IT UP." HE HAD NEVER COMMITTED A SIN. HE'D NEVER DONE ANYTHING WRONG. HE'D NEVER THOUGHT ANYTHING EVIL. HE WAS JUST A LITTLE OVER 30 YEARS OF AGE. AND THERE HE WAS, HANGING. IN YOUR PLACE AND MINE. AND HE COULD LOOK FORWARD THROUGH THE CENTURIES AND SEE YOU. HE SEES YOU, HE SAW YOU THEN, AS YOU SIT HERE TONIGHT. HE KNOWS YOUR HEART, HE CAN READ YOUR MIND. HE KNOWS WHAT YOU'RE THINKING. AND HE SAYS "I LOVE YOU. I LOVE YOU." FROM THE CROSS THERE'S ONE WORD THAT COMES OVER AND OVER AGAIN - LOVE, LOVE, LOVE. HE LOVES YOU. AND HE'S WILLING TO FORGIVE YOU OF ALL YOUR SINS. SIN IS A FAILURE TO LIVE UP TO GOD'S ETHICAL AND MORAL STANDARDS. AND THE SCRIPTURE SAYS, "ALL UNRIGHTEOUSNESS IS SIN." SO WE'RE SINNERS BY NATURE, WE'RE BORN WITH THAT SEED WITHIN US, AND THEN WE'RE SINNERS BY CHOICE. YOU CHOOSE TO SIN, ON YOUR OWN. AND THEN YOU'RE SINNERS BY PRACTICE. WE SIN EVERY DAY. EITHER SINS OF OMISSION OR SINS OF COMMISSION. YOU HAVE TO REPENT OF SIN. THAT MEANS YOU SAY TO GOD, "I'M SORRY I'VE SINNED. I'M WILLING TO CHANGE MY WAY OF LIFE. I CAN'T DO IT MYSELF, I'VE TRIED AND I'VE FAILED." BUT THE SPIRIT OF GOD WILL COME AND HELP YOU TO CHANGE. (Applause) GOD WILL HELP YOU TO CHANGE AND THAT'S REPENTANCE. YES, THAT VOID IN YOUR LIFE CAN BE FILLED TONIGHT BY CHRIST. HE CAN FORGIVE THE PAST, RECONCILE YOU WITH YOUR HUSBAND OR YOUR WIFE OR YOUR CHILDREN OR YOUR FRIENDS OF BUSINESS. GIVE YOU A WHOLE NEW DIRECTION IF YOU WILL RECEIVE HIM. AND I'M GOING TO ASK YOU TO DO THAT RIGHT NOW. I'M GOING TO ASK YOU TO GET UP OUT OF YOUR SEAT, COME AND STAND IN FRONT OF THE PLATFORM AND ALL AROUND... AND BY COMING, YOU'RE GOING TO SAY, "I DO TURN FROM MY SIN AS BEST I CAN WITH GOD'S HELP. I WANT TO COMMIT MYSELF TO HIM, AFRESH AND ANEW. I WANT TO REALLY KNOW CHRIST. I WANT TO LEAVE HERE WITH CERTAINTY IN MY HEART. WE GOTTA FIND OUT WHEN THEY'RE BRINGING THE POPCORN HERE... (Billy Graham) YOU GET UP AND COME RIGHT NOW. CAN YOU IMAGINE IF WE COULD GET A 3RD OF THESE PEOPLE TO COME SEE HARRIS PLAY INSTEAD OF PREACH? WE COULD CLEAN UP... SPIVAK? (Billy Graham) SO START NOW, IF YOU COME FROM THE TOP, BUT DON'T LET DISTANCE KEEP YOU FROM CHRIST BECAUSE YOU MAY NEVER HAVE ANOTHER MOMENT LIKE THIS. TO BE BORN AGAIN MEANS TO BE BORN FROM ABOVE. THE HOLY SPIRIT OF GOD COMES IN AND GIVES YOU A NEW HEART. YOU SEE, YOUR OLD NATURE IS NO GOOD. YOU HAVE TO HAVE A NEW NATURE. YOU HAVE TO HAVE A NEW HEART. "A NEW HEART ALSO WILL I GIVE YOU AND A NEW SPIRIT WILL ACT QUICK WITHIN YOU," SAYS EZEKIEL 36. WHEN YOU COME TO HIM TO PRAY, MAKE IT SIMPLE. SAY, "LORD, I LOVE YOU." THAT'S A PRAYER. SAY, "OH GOD, I CONFESS MY SINS." THAT'S A PRAYER. AND THEN YOU CAN START TELLING HIM ALL ABOUT YOUR NEEDS AND YOUR PROBLEMS AND YOUR RELATIONSHIPS, AND HE KNOWS IT ALREADY - HE WANTS TO HEAR YOU SAY IT SO YOU'RE DEPENDING ON HIM TO HELP YOU. (Car engine) WASN'T SURE YOU'D SHOW. LATE NIGHT? IT'S THE LAST THING I THOUGHT WOULD HAPPEN. YA, WELL, THAT MAKES 2 OF US. (Swak) BUT I CAN UNDERSTAND WHEN YOU GET OLDER WHY YOU'D WANT TO GO BACK TO THE CHURCH - THE EMOTIONAL CRUTCH AND ALL... SPARE THE PLATITUDES, ROBBIE. I KNOW WHAT I DID LAST NIGHT. IT SCARES ME TO DEATH TOO. (Swak) I THOUGHT THAT GRAHAM HAD SOME INTERESTING THINGS TO SAY. NO, REALLY I DID. THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE SHOW UP TO HEAR SOME GUY QUOTE THE BIBLE, HE'S OBVIOUSLY GOT SOMETHING TO SAY. YEAH, THAT... SOMETHING AMAZING HAPPENED TO ME. I MEAN THERE WAS LIKE... DR. GRAHAM CALLED IT... PEACE. I FELT THIS FORGIVENESS I NEVER FELT... FORGIVENESS? WHAT'VE YOU EVER DONE WRONG? CHEAT AT SCRABBLE? (Spivak) IT GOES BEYOND WHAT I'VE DONE WRONG. IT'S SOMETHING I ALWAYS FELT WAS MISSING IN MY LIFE. LAST NIGHT, IT JUST FELT RIGHT. TIME WILL TELL. LOOK, I BUY THAT THERE'S SOME GOD, OR WHATEVER, WHO MADE THE UNIVERSE, BUT WHEN IT COMES TO MY OWN LIFE... I'M RESPONSIBLE FOR ME. I'VE MADE MYSELF WHAT I AM. SURE YOU WANT THAT RESPONSIBILITY? THE TRUTH IS... I WISH I COULD GO GET WHAT YOU GOT AND HAVE WHAT CODY HAS. I WISH IT WAS AS SIMPLE, FOR ME. BUT IT'S JUST NOT. WHY DO YOU HAVE TO COMPLICATE IT? IF I DIDN'T COMPLICATE IT, I'D REALIZE I HAD NOTHING. (Swak) BUT THEN AGAIN, I'LL HIT A BEAUTY SHOT LIKE THAT ONE, AND I'LL FORGET ALL ABOUT THE MEANING OF LIFE AND THE UNIVERSE AND JUST FOCUS ON WINNING, BEATING THE OTHER GUY, CLOSING THE DEAL. SPEAKING OF WHICH, WHAT DID OUR DEAR CODY SAY? SAID HE WAS PRAYING ABOUT IT. GREAT! WE COULD TRY IT. PRAY? YOU ARE NUTS, AREN'T YOU? PRAY THAT CODY WOULD DO THE RIGHT THING. YOU CAN DO THAT? (Phone rings) COMPLETELY INSANE. HELLO?... UM HUM. YES! GREAT NEWS, JULIE! CODY HARRIS IS IN. AND WE DIDN'T EVEN HAVE TO PRAY! WINANS CALLED FOR THE FOURTH TIME AT 9:15. HE WANTS TO SPEAK WITH YOU IMMEDIATELY. AND THIS WAS JUST DELIVERED TO MR. SPIVAK FROM A CODY HARRIS. OPEN IT. SHOW ME CONTRACTS. THAT'S A CONTRACT. MS. STEELE? MR. HARRIS IS WAITING FOR YOU IN YOUR OFFICE. (Knocking) (Robbie) EXCUSE ME, MISS STEELE? JUST WANTED TO SEE WHAT IT WAS LIKE IN THE HOT SEAT. NICE JERSEY. DOES IT FIT? YEAH, FITS JUST FINE.

I WON'T PLAY MY OLD GAME ANYMORE. I WON'T PLAY DIRTY. YOU'RE SAYING? YOU DID YOUR RESEARCH. I TOOK A LOT OF GUYS OUT OF THE GAME FOR AWHILE. BROKEN NOSES... BROKEN TIBIAS, THAT KIND OF THING. SEE, I THOUGHT IT WAS OK THEN BECAUSE IT WAS MY BUSINESS. I GET THE ANALOGY. BUT I HAVEN'T BROKEN ANY TIBIAS LATELY, THANK YOU VERY MUCH. YEAH, MAYBE NOT. YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU AND I ARE AN AWFUL LOT ALIKE... TO DO WHAT YOU DO, YOU HAVE TO PUT YOUR BLINDERS ON. SOONER OR LATER YOU'RE GONNA RUN INTO SOMETHING PAINFUL. WE'LL SIGN CONTRACTS LATER. PRESS CONFERENCE AT NOON.

SORRY I'M SO LATE, I DIDN'T REALIZE WE WERE HAVING A MEETING. HI. ROBERTA STEELE. JOHN GARRISON, ROBBIE, NEVILLE FLEMING, WESLEY LANE, THIS IS TRAVIS NOE, YOU KNOW MERRIL... WE'VE MET. AND WAYNE WILSON. NICE TO MEET YOU. SO, WHAT'S GOING ON? ARE WE TAKING ON A NEW CLIENT? PETE, WHY DON'T YOU TAKE MERRIL AND OUR GUESTS ON AHEAD TO THE RESTAURANT, AND I'LL JOIN YOU SHORTLY. SURE THING! THIS WAY GENTLEMEN. ROBBS, YOU'RE WELCOME TO TAGALONG IF YOU WANT. WELL... THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A SURPRISE. OH, BUT IT IS. WHAT'S THIS? OPEN IT. JUST A LITTLE TOKEN OF MY APPRECIATION. YOU HAVE EXCEEDED ALL MY EXPECTATIONS. WHAT'S THIS FOR? A LITTLE THANK YOU. IT WAS YOUR IDEA ACTUALLY. WHAT WAS MY IDEA? MOVING THE TEAM. YOU JUST MET THE NEW OWNERS OF THE MINNESOTA BLADES. THIS WAS YOUR STRATEGY FROM THE START. IT WAS A NEGOTIATING TACTIC. A PLOY. LOOK, THIS DEAL BENEFITS ALL OF US. AND BELIEVE ME, YOU HAVEN'T BEEN LEFT OUT. BUT, THIS IS WAY TOO SOON... IT JUST DOESN'T SEEM FAIR TO THE TEAM... OR THE TOWN... FAIR? WE DIDN'T WANT FAIR - WE WANTED TO WIN. THIS DEAL MAKES YOU ONE OF THE WINNERS, NOT TO MENTION, ONE VERY WEALTHY WOMAN. HAROLD, I'M GOING TO HAVE TO TALK TO WINANS ABOUT THIS BECAUSE I'M NOT SURE I CAN GO ALONG WITH IT. GO ALONG WITH IT? YOU HAVE NO CHOICE. WHEN THIS MOVE HAPPENS, AND IT WILL HAPPEN, YOU WILL TAKE THE CREDIT ALONG WITH THE BLAME. YOU THINK MERRIL WINANS THOUGHT TWICE ABOUT THIS DEAL? YOU THINK HE'S A BIG FAN OF YOURS? YOU NEARLY BLEW THIS FOR ALL OF US. HE TOLERATES YOU. BUT HE DOES NOT RESPECT YOU. HE WILL MOVE THIS TEAM, AND WHEN HE DOES, YOU'LL HAVE FINALLY MADE A NAME FOR YOURSELF. YOU'LL BE THE MOST HATED WOMAN IN CANADA. ♪ (Soft piano) ♪ (Phone rings) ♪ ♪ (Phone ringing) (Swak, Swak, Swak, Swak) (Cody) SEEN THE NEWS? THEN AGAIN, I GUESS IT ISN'T NEWS TO YOU, IS IT? HEY, NICE WATCH... WELL, YOU SURE HAD ME FOOLED. I GUESS I SHOULD HAVE SEEN IT COMING THOUGH. MUST BE ONE SWEET DEAL. WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME, CODY? I'VE GOT TO GO ALONG WITH MY CLIENT'S WISHES. I'VE GOT TO DO WHAT'S BEST FOR THE TEAM. AND WHAT'S BEST FOR ROBERTA STEELE TOO... SAYS HERE YOU GET 4% OWNERSHIP AND A BIG PROMOTION. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS WALK OVER A FEW DEAD BODIES ON THE WAY UP TO THE TOP. WHEN WERE YOU PLANNING ON TELLING ME? OR WAS THAT WHAT THE OTHER NIGHT WAS ALL ABOUT? I JUST FOUND OUT MYSELF. C'MON ROBBIE... THERE'S NO REASON FOR ANYBODY TO BELIEVE ME. BUT BLOOM DID THE DEAL HIMSELF. I DIDN'T KNOW. BLOOM'S NOT EVEN MENTIONED IN THE ARTICLE. BUT YOU'RE ALL OVER IT. THEY MUST BE SINGING YOUR PRAISES DOWN IN THE STATES. I'M TELLING THE TRUTH. THEN PROVE IT. PUT A STOP TO IT. IT'S UN-STOPPABLE! I'VE MADE CERTAIN OF THAT. AND IF I FIGHT HIM AND LOSE, I HAVE NOTHING! EVERYTHING I'VE WORKED FOR IS GONE! WHO'S HIDING OUT NOW? WHAT WAS IT YOU SAID TO ME BEFORE? WHEN THE GOING GETS ROUGH... C'MON, CODY! MY JOB IS WHO I AM! I'VE HAD TO FIGHT EVERY STEP OF THE WAY UP. AND NOW THAT I CAN FINALLY SEE THE TOP, YOU COME ALONG AND SAY "OH SORRY, WRONG MOUNTAIN, COME BACK DOWN AND TRY THIS ONE?" YOU HAD TO FIND THAT OUT FOR YOURSELF. WHY NOT WHEN I WAS STARTING THE CLIMB? WHY NOW, WHEN I'M THIS CLOSE, WHEN I THINK I'VE GOT IT ALL FIGURED OUT, GOD COMES ALONG AND CHANGES THE RULES. IT JUST DOESN'T SEEM FAIR! WHO TOLD YOU IT'D BE FAIR? GOD'S PLAYING A WHOLE OTHER GAME. HE WANTS YOU TO WIN. HE WANTS TO WIN YOU. WHY DON'T YOU TAKE IT UP WITH HIM. I'M SO SORRY. I KNOW THAT I SHOULD. BUT I CAN'T. ♪ (Piano/Reflective) ♪ (Billy Graham) WHEN YOU COME TO HIM TO PRAY, MAKE IT SIMPLE. SAY, "LORD, I LOVE YOU." THAT'S A PRAYER. SAY, "OH GOD, I CONFESS MY SINS." THAT'S A PRAYER. AND THEN YOU CAN START TELLING HIM ALL ABOUT YOUR NEEDS AND YOUR PROBLEMS AND YOUR RELATIONSHIPS, AND HE KNOWS IT ALREADY. HE WANTS TO HEAR YOU SAY IT SO YOU'RE DEPENDING ON HIM TO HELP YOU. PLEASE, GOD, PLEASE JESUS... IF YOU'RE A SAVIOR... I REALLY NEED A SAVIOR... (Lawn mower engine) UH OH. HI MOM. SHE'S HERE! WHO'S HERE? THE TERMINATOR! ROBBS? I'M SORRY, I KNOW IT'S SATURDAY. BUT I NEED YOU TO GET THE INVESTORS TOGETHER. MEET US AT THIS ADDRESS? (Robbie) I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU ALL FOR COMING ON SUCH SHORT NOTICE. I'M SURE YOU'VE READ THE PAPER. I OWN THE PAPER! GENTLEMEN, LET'S GIVE MS. STEEL A CHANCE TO EXPLAIN HERSELF. I STAND TO LOSE A QUARTER OF A MILLION DOLLARS IN DEVELOPMENT FEES IF THIS BLOWS UP. I'M AFRAID I CAN'T OFFER YOU MORE THAN AN APOLOGY. YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING. THE TRUTH IS... I DON'T THINK I CAN STOP THIS. IF MINNESOTA WANTS TO MOVE THE TEAM, THE TEAM WILL MOVE. I TRULY REGRET THE CULPABILITY I BEAR IN THIS. OH, THAT'S JUST GREAT! I THOUGHT YOU TOLD US YOU DIDN'T KNOW. I DIDN'T KNOW THAT BLOOM PLANNED TO MOVE THE TEAM. I DID KNOW HE WANTED TO UP THE ANTE. IT WAS MY JOB TO MAKE SURE THAT HAPPENED. YOU TREATED ME AS A FELLOW WORKER, YOU TRUSTED ME, AND I DECEIVED YOU... FOR THAT, I AM PROFOUNDLY SORRY. SO, THAT'S IT? IT'S OVER? SO WE'RE JUST GIVING UP? OK. YOU'LL BE HEARING FROM MY LAWYER. WELL, THERE GOES A LITTLE PIECE OF CANADA. A LITTLE PIECE OF CANADA... HE'S EXTREMELY BUSY. MORNING, NANCY. MS. STEELE, YOU CAN'T GO IN THERE! ROBERTA! WE'RE HAVING A CONFERENCE. I DIDN'T COME TO TALK TO YOU HAROLD, I CAME TO TALK TO MR. WINANS. I SAID WE'RE HAVING A CONFERENCE... HERE HARRY. READ THIS. WHAT IS THIS? IT'S A REQUEST FOR AN INJUNCTION PREVENTING A MOVE UNTIL THE COURT CAN DETERMINE THE ECONOMIC RAMIFICATIONS TO THE COMMUNITY. NOW, MR. WINANS... I WANT YOU TO FORGET ALL ABOUT THE OFFER FROM THE STATES. HAVE YOU LOST YOUR MIND? NO, ACTUALLY, I THINK I'VE JUST REGAINED IT. YOU'RE TOO LATE. I'VE ALREADY GIVEN MY WORD TO MINNESOTA. AND I THINK WE ALL KNOW WHAT THAT'S WORTH. NOW, MR. WINANS, I'M GIVING YOU AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO THE RIGHT THING, TO SAVE MONEY, AND TO SAVE FACE. SAVE FACE? THIS DEAL. IT'S NO GOOD. I WANT YOU TO RECONSIDER FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS. #1: THE BLADES BELONGS IN VANCOUVER. I DON'T CARE ABOUT THIS TOWN. ALL I CARE ABOUT IS MONEY. 2: YOU'LL LOSE MONEY. CITIZENS HAVE ALREADY ORGANIZED TO BOYCOTT YOUR BUSINESSES AND PICKET YOUR OFFICES. ROBERTA, THIS IS A DONE DEAL. NOW GO STAND OUTSIDE THE DOOR UNTIL I CALL FOR YOU. GO ON. BOYS, WHY DON'T YOU GO DOWN TO THE COMMISSARY AND HAVE A COFFEE FOR A MOMENT. GO AHEAD GUYS. GO ON. EVERYTHING YOU'VE EVER WANTED TO KNOW ABOUT EMINENT DOMAIN. EMINENT DOMAIN? A LITTLE CASE I'VE BEEN WORKING ON. YOU TELL HIM ABOUT IT HARRY. WELL... UNDER CANADIAN AND INTERNATIONAL LAW, A SOVEREIGN POWER... IN THIS CASE, THE CITY OF VANCOUVER... IS ENTITLED TO POSSESSION OF PROPERTY... IN THIS INSTANCE, THE BLADES... IF ITS LOSS IS DEEMED DETRIMENTAL TO... TO THE GOOD OF THE PUBLIC. WELL, THAT'S FINE, HARRY, BUT JUST ONE THING - THE BLADES AREN'T A PIECE OF REAL ESTATE. AND I QUOTE, "BUYING THE BLADES IS LIKE OWNING A LITTLE PIECE OF CANADA." CAN SHE DO THAT? ROBBIE, YOU'RE NOT BEING FAIR. I'D BE FORCED TO SELL THE TEAM TO THE CITY? AT "FAIR" MARKET PRICE, LESS ANY BACK RENT YOU OWE ON THAT LEASE AT THE COLISEUM. WHY? WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS TO ME? BECAUSE WHAT YOU'RE DOING ISN'T RIGHT. IT MAY BE LEGAL, BUT IT'S NOT ETHICAL. THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE!! THERE HAS TO BE. THAT'S WHAT I GET FOR INVITING A WOMAN INTO THE FIRM. HAVE A NICE DAY, GENTLEMEN. I LOVE THIS. NOW I SEE WHY YOU LOVE THE MOUNTAINS. EASIER TO FILTER OUT THE NOISE AND HEAR GOD'S VOICE. (Car horn) THEN AGAIN, WHY RISK WIND SHEARS WHEN YOU GOT A PERFECTLY GOOD PARK RIGHT ACROSS THE STREET FROM THE OFFICE? HOW'S THE READING COMING? I CAN'T GET THROUGH THE FIRST CHAPTER. EVERY VERSE IS... SO... YOU'RE NOT OUT JOB HUNTING? NAH. I THINK I'M GOING TO TOUGH IT OUT. BESIDES, I THINK BLOOM MAY BE LOOKING AT AN EARLY RETIREMENT AFTER TONIGHT'S TOWN MEETING. THOUGHT OF BECOMING A SPORTS AGENT? 'CAUSE I KNOW AN OLD VET WHO CAN STILL USE REPRESENTATION. I'LL PRAY ABOUT IT. REALLY? YA, I'M TAKING SOME TIME TO CLIMB THE RIGHT MOUNTAIN... SEE WHAT GOD REALLY WANTS FOR ME. AND YOU SHOULD KNOW, I TAKE 25%. OH, FORGET IT. THAT'S NOT FAIR! WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING? CROSS CHECK! (Boy) WELL, THERE'S NO CHECKING. YOU'RE A GOALIE. NOW GO SIT IN THE PENALTY BOX. GET HER! (Girl) CODY HARRIS SHOOTS! SCORES!! WHERE DO YOU THINK A KID GETS THAT? I DON'T KNOW, BUT IF I EVER SEE HER AGAIN, SHE'S GOT A JOB.
