Kids, I need all of you to help out. You know the tragedy we've suffered here, And I need all of you to come together. I will also help you out. But we need to work together to overcome this terrible ordeal. Do you agree? Good morning students. You may sit down. Today we'd like to 'welcome' to our three friends whom we are lucky have come back to us. Good. Well, I think it is also important that we make them feel at home just like before. Good. Everyone's affer him... We definitely know who it is. Not anyone could do this. It was only the two boys, not the girl. We have no idea who we're living with. And the kid's teacher, that Sergio guy ? Look at the fear. They don't even let their kids walk two blocks. I'm not comfortable being used as detective. I prefer just helping them. Yes. Yes, I'm just arriving. Yeah, they just called me with an update. You'd probably call this place a 'dump', darling. They say he's very good. He's an Israelite, His family moved here after the war. Mayor, I know this is not the best time, but it's not always easy to corner you. Remember you promised to replace the school's basketball hoops I'd be grateful, because the structure is now very rusty very unstable, it's as old as... Yes, I'm onto it. One child almost suffered an accident my apologies, but if I don't take this opportunity... How are you? I'm Mayor Rostagno. Welcome, inspector. Good afternoon. I'd like to introduce to you Inspector Cohen. Due to the seriousness and nature of the crime, They sent us the best at the federal level. Sofia, is our local judge. Maria is the school's headmistress. The school psychologist, Isabel Schiller. And responsible for the children's medical care is doctor Kramer First and foremost we need to seek out actual facts preferably from the source. I asked you, miss Schiller, to be here today because you seem to be the best placed Considering you know the children well. Inspector, in all my years of work, I've not seen anything like this. It's as though they suffer from. . . a kind of selective mutism. They hardly speak. Mutism is not unusual in children, but that all three suffer the exact same symptoms... Stop it, guys. Don'f laugh about this. In what state are they in? Maybe we need to take decisions. Like which, Sofia? Put them in real professional's hands. Intern them? Parents would not be too pleased... Parents are NOT the best at knowing what's best for them. If the children's state worsens perhaps we'd review this, and involve other parties. But for now, the best placed person is yourself. I understand that your men, along with volunteers are scouring Take away kids, old people and women, that's it, we'll know who it is! Let's cut the bullshit. Police will never do it. You'd exclude minors? They are guilty in half of my cases! We know people here better than anyone! In fact, we have a good idea who it might be... I looked through all archives and found no similar case And no one here capable of such crimes. Not since the war. What happened to you? Didn't you see anyone? How do you feel? Where were you? They were surely in the 'Shame' It's true I saw them there that day. It was raining, that's why I didn't go. Where were the kids when they disappeared? My son hasn't come back yet. I don't know. Maybe in the 'Shame'. The Shame? It's an old abandoned hospital Kids go there to play, we can'f stop them. Even if we try to stop them. It belonged to the Himmel's. Germans that owned everything here. You know, take one or two letter away from people family names here, and they all very recognisable names. Now in this town they pretend they never existed. But most of them are from there. Government took their land away to build a national hospital. The old lunatic still lives there. Can't get rid of him. He lives in a shack there, alone. The lunatic Himmel. They told me that Juan Cerboni, is the... He's not the father. Lucio needed a father It doesn't look like it now, but at 9 years old I could not control him. Nor my father. He was very wild. So I asked Juan to help out. That suited him, he always liked me, the easy slut. Juan is close to the boy in any way? No, Juan never helped me. Didn't help at all, he just wanted me. He's a drunk, a loser. Then he found the word of God, and came to preach to ME. You can imagine how that ended... Get lost! Get lost! You heard? Don'f come back! What did they do to my son? Welcome. Come in. I have to say, this is the worst case of sexual mutilation I've known. Based on the elliptical shape of the wounds, the knife wounds one can see here, And the grazes on the pubis area One could deduce that the criminal was twisting the knife. The red marks, here and here, One can deduce is was a serrated fishing knife, or similar. With the serrated edges visible. Based on a more detailed analysis, one can see marks made by the knife handle, as it was plunged into the flesh. In your opinion, could one conclude this was done for sexual gratification? They look like teeth marks. What the hell! Make it worse won't you! You've nothing better to do? Why do you need to see them pictures? They excite you? - The men found anything? - What? - The bloody 'parts' for God's sake! No, of course not. Probably in someone's freezer. Bastard sons of bitches. Seems we have a new Mengele here. That's if he ever left. Don't look at him. Darling, blow. The girl shouldn't be here. She can't even dress herself. This is pathetic. Where were the kids when they disappeared? Maybe in the Shame. It belonged to the Himmels 'Welcome to Mayor Rostagno's new hospital. Shame' 'Private property. Do not enter' He's healing well. I don't need to see her anymore. Physically she's fine. Now psychologist Schiller will take care of her. Paola. We need to talk. About what? Lucio. Well, you know I speak to him at school. Yes, about... me and Lucio. Of course. Call me. You know them better than anyone here. You've worked with them over one year. What's your opinion. What d'you think has happened? Evil. Yes of course. But, don't you think... It pains me. The biggest part of evil, everyday evil, is invisible to us. We hide it so well. Newspaper headlines accuse, and accuse. But, it's only the visible part of evil. Which is everywhere, and that we all support, turning a blind eye. And this makes you feel angry? When evil is so present the natural flow of life is stinted. And nothing can progress. And the kids are in a state of great suffering. They will be, until evil is regulated. Well, we all want to find the guilty one. We are ALL guilty. Evil generates more evil. It ramifies. And spirals out of control, unbalancing everything. A cancer that grows until it is cut out from the body. The kids carry the weight of all this evil here. But unlike antibodies, they have feelings. Maybe, the culprit will hand himself in. You understand evil better than anyone here. The evil that doesn't make newspaper headlines. But who's doing it? - No one knows. - Who cares! You stick it in, you cum, that's all. Probably his mother. It's the baker. No, he does that at home. It's a dog. Can't we see who's behind? I tried, but there's no way in. But, . . .you've already done it? Don't be a faggot. Or yours doesn'f reach that far? And he comes three times a day! Ok. But you all have to leave. Get out of here! Out! The lunatic! Out, rats! The lunatic! How long have you been here? About two years. Why did you leave your town, your job there? I couldn't find what I was looking for. It's a little vague. I suffered an accident, they attacked me. When I woke one week later, I couldn'f find what I was looking for. What were you looking for? Answers. You came to his place to find answers? Are you pleased with their welcome here? I don't really speak to people much. But I think they like my work. Which is serious and professional. Yes, I spoke with your old employers. They speak well of you. But they also say that you changed after your accident. It wasn't an accident. A while back, just before your family moved to this country in Europe they gave Hitler the power. Because he acted out our darkest desires. That way we remained anonymous. Everyone supported him. Some passively, but all supported him. Strangely, after he died they claimed he was a lone crazy wolf, with malefic powers. When actually he was our biggest open window on human nature. Our communal conscience. We still suffer from this today. And trying to heal from it. Including in this town. Guys, look for a screw loose somewhere here... The headmistress should have fired him. - They should have fired her too. . . - Old Himmel has died. What?! I don't know, he fell, the abandoned lot... - Sad. . . - Sad? One less son-of-a-bitch in town. You have enemies? They say we're social animals. There is no species on earth less capable of living in group. No sooner they come together that evil starts. Since they built the 'Shame' they say. This town has always been putrid, but this is something else. You know where men open up most easily? Where they show their secrets Their truths, their sins? On public toilet walls. That's how much we value truth in our society. We anonymously scratch it on toilet walls surrounded by the smell of shit. The 'Shame' is like our giant latrine. It's like a our moral garbage dump. It's as though once there, one permitted oneself to act out ones darkest side. It infects us. You visit the place? Sometimes, not often. What do you think of Himmel's death? It fell at an odd moment. 'Fell'? Appropriate word. I don't know. . . A bitter old man, decides to take revenge on society for all the harm inflicted, for taking his land away, punishes the town's children, perhaps inspired by events from his own country Later, feels remorse, and decides to end it all himself. That would be ideal, but I don'f believe so. Why 'ideal'? Don't you think it could have been him? I only meant that since your people suffered so much you might have wanted to find a criminal in him. Yes, sure. We killed Christ, and all that. Very deep. Can you now answer the question please? No. I didn't mean it like that. I can't say I appreciated Himmel or his family. They brought the worst of the Old World here. But a five year old could have pushed him over. You should keep looking. It can't be easy living a life of celibacy. It can't be easy being a cripple. If you see anything interesting written on public toilet walls, let me know. Excuse me headmistress. - Yes? - Jaime drew this. Mr. Himmel's fall. Kids are so sensitive... They soak things up so easily. It doesn't look like it, but they're actually like sponges. You'll learn that over the years. Yes. But... He drew it the day of his death. They hadn't found his body yet. You're Jaime? You're Jaime? This is your drawing? So, this is yours? It's a huge house, with two... It's on Internet What's on Internet? This drawing is on Internet? And this drawing, who is it? Ok, Jaime, stop playing stupid games now. You're a big boy now, not a baby. Who is it? You. It's me? And I'm dead like Mr.Himmel? And who killed me? You. We're in Judge Muller's office Is there any progress on the current investigation, Due to the secrecy of the investigation I am not able to answer you. But I can tell you we believe it is probably a repeat offender Hello Mayor. - How are you? - Very well, thank you. - How are the kids at school this year? - Pretty good. And the three children? Are you aware of any other such similar crimes in the country? Unfortunately, crime levels rise every year and we are no exception to that rule. We've been talking, analysing the problem with the Judge we believe it necessary to have the kids committed as soon as possible. I don't think it's that bad... You know, the problem is that we're dealing with more national press every day pressuring us, and the town... and it isn't good for us. Do you believe that those in charge here are apt for such a task? Of course. We also have a federal investigator. But aside from that, in recent years we have resolved 70 land related disputes 800 thefts, 54 cases abuse of a minor, 3 murders The figures you give us seem very high for such a small town. And the parents? I'll deal with the parents. Well, the truth is, I owe you so many favours We need you to write up a report on them. If you think that's best. The truth is, you are taking a weight off my shoulders. The figures are lower than the national average. You and the Mayor have been in charge for now 12 years Do you intend continuing, or are you thinking in your retirement? Of course I'll continue. Don't move. - Kids, should we go for a pizza? - Yes! She crazy! See, it's ever since she sticks around the three kids I don't even know who you are, what are you doing here? I know who you are, you're the same as those who locked up my father Who? You bastards! The same who locked up my old man We live like animals here! Look, I know nothing of this. I can't make you talk but this about your son, not mine. They took their land away They wanted it to build a large national hospital And they rebuilt the hospital? You've seen the Mayor's house? You think his salary paid for that? They never re-built the hospital. When it all went wrong, my father who was the contractor lost everything: his machines, his men, everything. He was left without a job. He tried to accuse the son-of-a-bitch And that dog of a Judge put him in prison. They're all in it together. All of them. I was just twelve at the time. They took everything from us. Look at the old man now... You think someone hated him enough to do this to your son? They all hate us! I'm the village slut and my father a thief. But it wasn't ONLY my kid there was it? Lucio. Can I come in a minute? Come in. Isabel, what have they done to my son? I've not come here to talk about the past. If at any moment you were angry, I'm sorry. You were angry at me, I don't know. I don't want to talk of what happened. I need you help. Not for me, but for Lucio. Paola, I do all I can. And I have as much information as others. It's as though he never came home. He's in another place. I studying the possibility of this being caused by an autistic disconnect. Caused by the trauma. Look, often victims enter a state of. . . - No. It's like he's not there. I lost him. They are symptoms of depression. It's very common, considering the circumstances. One loses the ability to communicate in certain ways. But it's only when I'm with him. I hug him and he makes me recall all of my life. But he leaves me empty. Isabel, he's not getting better. He's getting worse. I see it, every day is worse. I feel it. You told nothing to Juan, did you? Much time has passed. And of course I'm going to remember. Perhaps one day I'll tell you how far this story took me. I asked you about Juan. No. Why should I tell him? It's your life. It didn't seem fair on Lucio. But he'll get better? It's still too early. 'Welcome to Mayor Rostagno's new hospital' . 'Shame' Lucio? Your mum is around? Poor kid. Better raised by a pack of wolves. Something's bothering you? Did you take things from the hospital? Lucio, that's an old story. The bricks you mean? Everyone knows that. No one needed them. You didn't take bricks away. You took lives away. Look, better than letting those bastard Nazi's have them. But you wouldn't understand that. You know what? You're speaking just like your thief of a grandfather. You stole lives. That's enough Lucio It's late now. Don't be offended, but some don't feel comfortable with what they are seeing. They feel like, a certain . . .coldness from you If you spoke to me, perhaps we could dispel those toxic rumours We need to help them now. Things have started to move too fast. Keep going... It's, in some ways what humans most fear. And the children would suffer even more. They'd be rejected. You telling me the children are sick in some way? They cannot get sick. They already died. Let's see... They suffered too much, and probably part of their childhood died. But one doesn't need to exaggerate. It's almost correct. But it was their bodies that died. And part of their souls remained. They are our antibodies. The flow of life. They will correct the imbalance. But yes. They were murdered. And you know it. Who killed them? Don't do that. Excuse me. How are you? How can I help you? I'm bothering you because I twice asked the files regarding the old hospital project. - And two other cases, - Please sit down. No thank you. But have not received any response yet. I came to ask if you could tell me the reasons for this. Perhaps the generalised apathy and incompetence that we all here suffer from. But, we'll assist you shortly. I'm most interested in the expropriation of the hospital land and the case against the grandfather of one of the victims, Lucio. No problem. I will myself request the files. Specifically, I'd like to know how the case was so swiftly resolved. And with the grandfather as only culprit. Well, I expect everything will be in the files. Though I don't know what the expropriation of land has to do with with the investigation we gave you. Look, firstly you didn't 'give me' this case. Which is anything but a gift. It's a federal case. And out of your league. Secondly, I will ask that you hand over the files in under 24 hours Failing that, I will have to seek support from a district judge. Don't get carried away. I don't think this is the correct tone. We are all here to help one another. I don't doubt that you all help each other out here. But I'll ask you not to act like my requests were bothering you. The case of a sexual sadist has to do with the expropriation of a hospital? Oh, come on! It's all connected as the school teacher would say. I'm please you're interviewing him, because in my opinion... I'll expect the files early tomorrow. Good day. He blames me for everything. He says that evil permeates the town and the only thing to stop it, is balancing it. The everything will be 'regulated'. And that the origin of it all is in the 'Shame'. I don't think the man's well. You'll need to interview him again. I sense something that. . . doesn't fit... Regarding the children I reached the limits of my competencies. The best thing to do would be to intern them. One minute please. I didn't see him. He was on the ground at night. What the hell was he doing there? What the fuck was he doing there? Ok. can you tell me what happened... I have no remorse though. That imbecile... shameless idiot was twenty years here, corrupt, cheat. I'd not be surprised if they came for me to kill me. But when they come to my house, I have a shotgun, and all my rights. All of them! You know what people think? You're making things worse. Get out of there! Set up a national press conference, it'll be good for the campaign. And I'd like the three children by my side. The three children? I don't think it's appropriate considering the situation... perhaps when they recover a little... The three of them. Even you seem more interested in the genitals, than what happened. I'll ask you not to provoke me. I'm not in the mood. No provocation. People don't speak of the children, only about that bit. And they try to hide it. It's medieval. Like all group reactions. Why do you try to worsen your situation? You're a suspect in this crime. At least you're involved, or know something. You should try to dissipate these rumours rather than posing as this illuminated, pseudo-Buddhist mystic, the way you do. Talking of 'the flow', and 'death', and the 'forces of nature' The children are only the last symptom of a long chain of evil. Or do you think that in Germany in the 30's they were 90 million malevolent people? Why the hell do you always talk of this, it happened over 75 years ago and has nothing to do with me, or the case we are talking about You are here because of what they did to your family. Leave my family out of this! You scorn what I say But you also are part of this flow of life. You also are seeking to regulate evil. It's your job, is it not? But here, things have gone too far. You cannot do it alone. But don't worry. The kids and their friends will help you. Stop talking bullshit, I ask you! Are you not aware the danger is real? From what I understand, the kids should have been dead. And I don't think the culprit is waiting for them to speak. He stabbed his neighbour. That's all I know. You know what that bastard told me?! You know what he said?! He's the uncle of one of the victims. It was his daughter who did it, not him. But stabbed him with what?! It wasn't her, it was me. But you've all gone mad here?! What are you looking at? Yes, darling, yes sorry... Keep quiet this time. It's as though I'm slipping. . . I cannot find the angle. They all hate each other, and no one realises it Even the police amongst them. It's a circus of the absurd. Who threw that?! Who threw that?! Go back home! Pablo, Candelaria, get away from there! It wasn't for no reason that I ... Remember when you had a head full of lice? And we shaved you because you thought they'd eat your head. Lucio answer me! Lucio, for God's sake, you're all I have. Say something. You're all I have left. Are we left with an idiot? We're left with a moron We're left with a retard? God exists, and is punishing us. He'll never have kids. He'll never grow. He'll stay like that all his life. He's an empty shell. What is this? It's Himmel's death. Put it again. Why do you do this? Why do you say such things? Many people are suffering, and you're just playing games. You told that boy to draw me, didn't you? Isn't it true? Answer me! What is this? You are looking for answers to the suffering but you're only thinking about yourself. I told you not try to find fault only in others. What is this? Some sort of vengeance, to 'correct' something? And if it were so, and do you justify it? There's no vengeance in a doctor's scalpel But I understand your posture. Tumours would also protest. Who are you to speak like that? Some think you're treading on toes Be careful who you upset. - Yes, of course, yes. - If the press gets word on this... Yes, I'm interested. You need to talk to Juan. What? You need to talk to Juan. Do you have a computer at home? Sir, I don't even have a phone at home. I said you need to speak to Juan. I'm talking of my son. You built your life around lies, and secrets. You've even forgotten what's true and what's not. What are you talking about? What have I done? All I do is care for the children. Care for them? You condemned them a while ago. Juan came to see you like a friend. And all that motivated you was the desire for revenge. You knew how Lucio was conceived. You knew that neither of them could or wanted to do harm. Don't be absurd. Evil is a continuous thread. Not just one person's actions. You're only part of the chain, nothing more. You killed these children through another. Please, now do the correct thing to do. Thousands of years of this, and they still throw stones. You're purifying yourself. But it's too late already. Father. Father. You know something. What do you know about Juan Cerboni, Lucio's mother's ex boyfriend? I recognise evil when I see it. We all did. And what had to happen, did. There's no place in this town for a woman like that. 'What had to happen'? Mutilate children? That's maybe something that your God would allow, but not ours. If I come to hear you withheld something about this crime I'll charge you as an accomplice. You're depraved. I need not tell you anything! What's more, I told you too much already. God's law protects me, as does yours. And you know it. God's law will protect you when they hear why you were sent away from your last parish? Hello Jaime, what are you doing here? Jaime? It has affected us so much... ...the preventive way... I am decided to do away with... ...my system will be: zero tolerance. What happened with the plans to build a new hospital 15 years ago? We keep working, and have all the good will in the world But if funds never arrive from the capital... That we have been requesting year after year there's nothing more we could do. We are involved in the battle, as always. . . Working for you. I think you're poorly informed, and have not listened to me... We need to clean this town and the country from this kind of delinquency. I propose. . . Get off. Please... I propose creating a list with all the names of sexual deviants... Like in the United States. . . We need to... take out delinquency from this town... I'm sorry. Call an ambulance! Quick! Help her up! This is Juan's house? He's not there. You know anything more? He's got an old camper It's in the Serafini's land. Get me a car and two men. He fell, help me! Please help me. Don't move! I'm sorry. I didn't want to hurt you. I thought you had died. I don't know if you know You were born of evil. You should never have been born. I never touched you there. I know. You left us. The dogs came. We were just meat. It would have been terrible to do that. You need to resolve this. - How? - To help us. I was going to hand myself in.
