You blew through your allotment quickly. Because my expenses added up quickly. Would you care to reveal those expenses? Apart from my usual, I hosted a benefit for the hungry. The press called that a party at Patrice's where you and your friends broke two chandeliers, damages totaling thirty-five thousand dollars. It got a little out of hand. At a five-star restaurant? And I suspect that your friends were the hungry who benefited. We've been appointed to make sure your money lasts. Which it won't, if we allow you to keep wasting it. Food and clothes - those are necessities. Three-hundred dollars on a scarf? Twenty-five hundred dollars on a hand bag? Uncle Lyle, don't you think that mommy and daddy would want me to be happy? Yes, of course. Then how can I be happy if I'm broke? Happiness doesn't depend on how much you spend. Look, the party... I thought you called it a benefit ...was a mistake. But it's in the past. It was two weeks ago. Look, I promise from now on I will be so much better. I know you will. * MUSIC PLAYING To Uncle Lyle! Yay, cheers! Ew, why do you keep inviting her? Seriously, she's such a drag. And what is she wearing? Yeah, look, we grew up together and she just keeps following me around, but, just, shhhh. Catherine, hi! You came. I did. How is my favorite socialite? Fabulous. We are celebrating. Oh, again. Honey, we need to take you shopping. Oh, no, I have my own clothes, thanks. If that's what you call those. It will be my treat. What, did you get more money again? Oh, I got you a present. Isabelle. Ah, just open it. Wow! Isn't it gorgeous? Yeah. Isabelle, did you spend twelve-hundred dollars on this? That is too much! Stop it, just put it on. Honey, why do you look so tired? I had the craziest day at work, there's this guy and he keeps calling me. Clay! Isabelle! What are we celebrating? Ugh! Absolute rubbish! Hi Uncle Lyle. Mm hmm, the benefit tomorrow, I remember. Mm hmm, for the children's hospital right? Yup, I will be there you can count on me. Alright Mm hmm. Ugh. Chloe, I need a getaway. Oh, when? Right away. I am so bored. Oh, I wish I could. I'm having some little, um, alterations done. Hey! I totally wish I could Isabelle. My dad's getting married. Again? Number five. Well that was quick. I promised him I'd come to the wedding this time. He says when I'm there for it the marriage lasts twice as long. Hey, Isabelle I can't talk right now I'm at work. Not for long... What? I'm going on a fabulous getaway. Okay? Come with me. I can't. Maybe you didn't hear me I'm working. Come on that bug company can do without you for a couple of days. Are you purposefully ignoring me? Come on we'll go some place that you want to go. Like, um... Wow, I can tell you've given this so much thought. ...skiing, you love skiing. We'll go to Sweden, no Switzerland. They've got good skiing there right? Well yeah, but... Okay! Pack your bags. We'll leave tomorrow, my treat. Isabelle, things are really busy right now. I can't just leave, can you ask... ...can you ask one of your other friends? No! I already tried that. Of course you did. Well, go by yourself. I can't. Besides I need somebody to entertain me. Isabelle! Besides, you owe me. Fine. Ha ha ha! * MUSIC PLAYING Oh, it's perfect, right? Yeah, it's really nice. Hey, are we going to check in soon? Hello? Let's go inside. Okay. Hey, um, I'm starving, Do you think they have a burger here? Mm hmm. Isabelle? I just don't understand. How could the presidential suite just not be available? I know. And it's not like this room is really pretty. You didn't even have a reservation. Now you sound just like that angry little man downstairs. Sorry. Do you want to go swimming? I think I'm going to go. I'll meet you there. Hey are you going out? Hi, umm Yeah, we're just going to go to dinner. Oh, well I'm hungry. And cold too. Didn't you bring anything warmer sweetheart? Heh heh... Umm. I mean I guess you could come with us. Gee, thanks, but I think I'll just get room service. Okay, bye. Hey wait! Don't stay out too late because we have skiing in the morning. Brrr, I hope they have a hot tub. Hey Isabelle. Isabelle? Are you up? You ready? Of course you're still asleep. Isabelle... Wakey wakey. Wake up Isabelle. Wake up! Isabelle, your credit card got declined! What? Woo, hoo! Come on, isn't this fun? Catherine! Come one, we're already going real slow. You know the snow will still be here if we go later. Oh my gosh. It was quite a drive out here, if you didn't notice from the taxi fare. Besides, as much fun as it was sitting around waiting for you to wake up, I'd rather not waste the time. Well, can you just wait? Yeah... I think, I think my skis are broken. He gave me broken skis. No your skis are fine. This isn't even skiing. Yes it is. It's cross-country skiing. It totally counts. But you're not even that good at it. But I like it. Besides it's really great exercise. Yeah, but I pictured slopes, and harmless flirting as we wait for the ski lift. And drinking hot beverages and sitting in the hot tub. Not this! You don't really ski, do you? I do too! I know how, thank-you! You say you go skiing all the time. No, I say I go to ski resorts all the time. It's very different. Ok well, listen, it's actually really fun. You just have to give it a chance. I'm sure. Make-up? Really? Look, always look your best. It is the one rule I live by. Just... you do your thing and I will do mine. Alright? Ok... Are you ready? Ohh ahhh! No, don't laugh. I'm sorry. Here... No, this is so stupid! You are stupid! I am having you shipped back to America as soon as we get back and I get something hot to drink. Ow! This is it! I've had enough! Yeah, well, you promised me skiing, so... On slopes! Well, you never specified that. And besides, this is what I wanted to do. It's all about what you want isn't it? You are so spoiled! Yeah, I get that all the time from you of all people. You know what? You're making me regret ever inviting you along. More like guilt tripping me into coming. Whatever! You get to free-load on a dream vacation, boo-hoo. Isabelle, I am not one of your groupies or free-loading friends. Well, I'm paying for this and I say... No, no I am tired of you holding the money over my head. I don't do that. Yes, you do! It was your uncle's idea to help my mom when she was sick and that was so great. But you... anytime you can you like to take credit for it. You're being ridiculous! No! What is ridiculous is you using that to get me to do whatever you want like come on this stupid trip. I don't even understand what you're complaining about. I mean you should feel lucky to even have me around. You are so full of yourself you actually think that the whole world revolves around you. Apparently not the whole world. You know what? I'm just going to go ahead. You can catch a cab back to the hotel, ok princess? Fine, be that way! Fine! You know what? When you're done with your whole cross-country thing you may as well pack your bags and go back to your stupid bug job because I'm uninviting you, missy! Oh, well, see you at home. Don't hold your breath. Now that you're gone I may extend my vacation and actually have some fun! Well that is what you do best, Isabelle. Oh, oh, oh, ahhh! Catherine? Are you still out here? I can't believe she abandoned me. Ow. It's okay. Oh, come on... I hate Switzerland! Ow! This is all her fault. I'll have her deported. Can't feel fingers... can't feel toes. But I can feel my ankle! Every step. Someone help me... Please! Someone help me! Hello? I need some help! Hello? I just need to use your phone. Please just... Hello? Hello? I need to... Can you let me in? I'm hurt. I got lost... Just need to use the phone. Ahhhh! Hey! Did she go to the fund raiser? I got word that she used the company plane to go to Switzerland. You have the authority to cut her off. There's the clause in the trust that gives you the option to hold back what she's to receive when she turns thirty. I can't hurt her. Of course not. But you can do what's best for her. Even if she doesn't like it. I appreciate your guidance. Well good, that should clear up the issue. But I am tired of these surprises that keep coming at the end of the quarter. So let's get it right. Did you talk to Lyle? Yes. How did he react? Not the way I did. She has him wrapped around her finger. I know he loves her, I understand that. But there's a line and she crossed it years ago. Well, give it two weeks. She'll be in hot water again. Maybe he'll listen then. Hey! You awake yet? Hello? Get away from me! You're in my house. Back away! I live here. Are you dangerous? If I say no are you going to believe me? No. My head hurts. It's because you hit it. You attacked me! No, but I could have. You broke into my home. I knocked. And then you broke in. The door was open. That doesn't make it an invitation. Listen to me... I need some food and something to drink. And some pain killers would be nice. I'm not your waiter. I know, but you'll have to do. That's it. Get out! I can't, I'm hurt. Well that didn't stop you from getting here. I got lost! Not my problem. I'm making it your problem. Now get me some food. Chili? In a can? Eat up. Alright. Rested, fed, now go on your way. My ankle hurts, and it hurts when I breathe. Well sadly, not enough to keep you from talking. It hurts when I breathe! Call an ambulance! Uh, no. Fine. A cab, whatever... There's no phone here. No internet either. Alright, then you'll just have to drive me to the hospital. Where's your car? I walked! From where? If I knew that, I would have gone there and not come here. Just get your keys. I don't have a car. Look... I am rich, alright, so whatever it takes, just get me back to civilization. There is no car here! Why? I don't need one. What, so you're just isolated up here? I was until you got here. Wait, there's really no phone, car, a snowmobile? Nope. Then how am I supposed to get back to my hotel? There is nothing within twenty-five miles of here. No bus stops either. The only way down is to walk. That doesn't make any sense! How do you live? I mean there must be a way down. I have someone who brings me what I need once a month. Great. And when do they come next? Two and a half weeks. The only way down in the meantime is on foot. Fine. Then this will just have to do. Whoa, no, no this will not do. You can't expect me to walk anywhere like this. I don't expect anything except for you to leave. Well I'm in no condition to do that so that's out of the question. Sure you are. Just stand up, hope over there until you're on the other side of the door. I'm not limping my way back to civilization. Thank-you. I don't care where you go, but you're not going to stay here. You wouldn't just throw me out in the cold? Because, I'm tired, cold, I need a bath... Which one's my room? Don't you have anything else? You mean women's clothes? Uh, yeah. Not in my closet. You want me to take a look at that ankle? Are you a doctor? Sit down... What is that thing? Don't touch it. Fine. What are all these? They're mine. Leave it alone. What's your name? Jeremy. I'm Isabelle Elliott in case you were wondering. Alright, this is probably going to hurt. It does! Yeah, sprained. Oh really? Bad enough that there's going to be some bruising. You have to ice it and stay off it for the next few days. It hurts. It's normal. Hang on... Where are you going? To get a bandage. I'm going to wrap it, but loose enough you can still have some movement. Easy! I though you just said I was not meant to move it. Well you want some give for motion, it's going to hurt a little bit more but heal with less complications that way. You don't want it to heal too tight or it's going to hurt more when you walk around on it later. What's wrong with your side? I hit it. Where? Ribs? I don't know. Well you said it hurt earlier, when you were breathing. Yeah... Where? There! Ahh, yeah, right there. You've probably got a cracked or bruised rib. There's nothing you can do about, just take it easy and let it heal. How do you know that anyway? I just do. What's with all this flannel anyway? Is this mountain man thing your permanent look? My clothes are none of your business. You should really have some standards. And you're welcome. Hope that's better than chili! So weird. Cleans up nice if he wants to. Yawn. Doctor Jeremy Andrew Edmunds. Jerk. Do you mind? Some of us are actually trying to sleep! Would you rather freeze? So much for good manners. I'm a guest, remember? Guests are expected. Just, shhh! Wow... Come in Henry. What are you doing? You should have met my sister. She's beautiful. She was quite a bit younger than me. Adorable, until she turned five and then she was a little firecracker. Is that where Isabelle gets it from? Maybe. Laura was fierce in standing up for people. And animals too. I can't count how many strays she brought home. I suppose that's how my parents felt about her husband. Just another stray, not good enough for her. So they thought. You disagreed? Oh, I stayed out of it. I could have been supportive. I had little interest in marriage or family of my own. Then they died and there I was with little Isabelle to watch over. What was she like as a child? Precocious, always thinking. She'd smile sweetly to win you over and that was it. Not much has changed then. Oh, I wasn't well suited for the role. She'd... Well I doted on her. How could I not? What are you doing? Building a birdhouse? What are you, fourteen? It's a hobby. What are you doing out here anyway? What do you mean? Well you're obviously not from here... What gave me away? And what's with the no phone, no internet, no anything? It's a bit boring don't you think? It's quiet. I like it that way. It's too quiet. So what about you? I'm a city girl. In fact if you had any contact with the outside world you may even recognize me. Let me guess... an actress. A celebrity of sorts. Great. I'm rich. Congratulations. I've always been rich. It suits me. You know, you still didn't answer my question. That's right. Fine. Here's your plate. Ew. What is that? Meatloaf. Let me guess... vegetarian. No but I've got taste buds. That is horrible. I don't know how you could eat that. Did your parents forget to teach you any manners after they gave you the golden pony? Yes, because they died. Alright, that's it... Ground rules. You're going to stay here you're going to follow them. Got it? Oh no, am I in trouble? You're in charge of lunch. You want anything else to eat you eat what I'm making or you fend for yourself. Next, try to be helpful. Whining all day doesn't count! Just try not to be so difficult. I'm not. Alright. Wake up princess! You are the epitomy of rudeness. You're the most self-centered person I've ever known. You've been here for almost two days and you've done nothing but whine and complain. I don't think a thank-you has ever once crossed your mind. Alright, I am completely bored... Oh. Sorry. What do you want? Well, I didn't mean to interrupt, but... I'm bored and I'm going crazy. Do you have anything to do? Do you play chess? You know it's your turn, right? I know. Oh, you'll be happy to know I've decided to forgive you for earlier. Really? What? Wait, ok we'll just play. Please... just... So, do you play chess very often? It's a two person game. Right. I just thought you might be one of those genius types. You know, that plays against themselves. I'm not that smart. Good point. Check. Why didn't you just sacrifice your queen? I would never do that. Why not? Too important. Check. You understand you're losing because of it, right? I told you, I'm not that smart. This is true... check mate. We could play a simpler game. You could go hide and I could count to ten. What are you making? Macaroni and cheese. Really? Aim to impress don't you? Fine. How about some dessert, mountain man? Lunch is ready. There. Wow. This looks good. What? What did you put on here? Just some paprika. I've seen it used before. It adds flavor. This? Yes. Cayenne pepper. No, it's not... Well I didn't know. I... You know I'm a guy right? I mean do you think I'm going to have paprika just lying around? Great. It's really not that bad. Okay, well I made a cake too. Really? Um hmm. Great! Prepare to be impressed. It's good. Really? Good. Oh, it's horrible. Yeah. You swallowed that. I didn't want to be rude. I followed the recipe... I don't understand. Are your sure? I know how to read a recipe. How much salt did you put in? Just a bit. And this? Sugar? A cup and a half I think. This is salt. That's the sugar. I grabbed... The wrong one. See this is exactly why I don't cook. Ever? No, never. Great! Now I ruined your shirt. Not that it's a great loss. It'll wash out. Do you have another shirt that I can borrow please? Yeah. Here. What is it? You said you didn't have any of this stuff. I said I didn't have any in my closet. Cheeky! Who's is it? My ex-wife's. I'd rather her stuff get dirty than mine. Thank-you. You been icing that ankle? By the way, thank-you so much for the clothes. It feels so good to be in women's clothes again. Besides the paparazzi may show up at any moment and I would love to be ready. I'm practically famous. So, um, how long have you been divorced? Three years. And are you okay with it? So is that why you moved up here? Yeah this was our getaway. After the divorce I made it permanent. It's so lonely though. So. Don't you miss home, or being around people? It's what I wanted and needed. Time to think. Time to... Pray? Yeah. So? It's just not my thing. It's fine if it's yours. I just... Thanks for the permission. I just don't get it. You know? You didn't grow up very religious did you? Not really. So... It works for me. Somebody to talk to. Someone to help. It's interesting. You should try it sometime. Why? I have pretty much everything that I want. What more is God going to give me? There are some things money can't buy. I don't know if this dress works for me. Is it to blah? It depends on your shoes... Oh, hi Catherine. Hey guys. Um, how's it going? Where's Isabelle? I don't know. She was going out of town. I know, I just, I thought that maybe she would be... You know what, nevermind. Some hot but completely poor guy probably caught her attention. She's so gullible. She doesn't even realize Clay only went out with her for her money. Ok, well, if you could just let me know when you see her. That would be great. Um, there's some hot water on the stove if you want some. Been there long? Just now. That alright? Yeah. Did you make all these birdhouses? Yeah. Do the birds actually use them? Free food helps. So many little details. It's an interesting hobby. I had a lot of time on my hands when I first moved here. Well what do you do with them all? I have a guy in town who sells them for me. You really need to lose the flannel. It keeps me warm. So do layers. My clothes, my choice. Alright. Do you have any pain killers? Yeah. Ankle acting up or is it the ribs? A little of both. How bad is it? Better than before. You mind if I take a look? Did you re-wrap this? Yeah. It's too tight. The swelling's gone done so... that's good. Have you had many sprained ankles? No. You sure sound like you have. I have a medical background. Like a doctor? Certainly don't flaunt it do you? No, gotta keep it quiet otherwise all the neighbors will come around any time they have any sort of ache. Right. So, do you practice around here at all? No. How come? I just don't. Well you're too young to be retired. What sort of a doctor were you? Doesn't matter. Were you a cosmetic surgeon? No. Don't get your hopes up. You can't blame me for asking. But you should tell me because I... Hey, I have an idea. In the interest of eating well tonight, how about I cook? Does that mean you don't want any more of my salty cake? No. But you can help. Oh, daring... Melinda. What? I want you to draft an agreement about Isabelle. Specifically her being unfit to receive the chunk of the trust when she turns thirty. It has to have Lyle's signature it needs to be unanimous. I think it will be. Find out where she is, what she's doing. It's been a little to quite and that never bodes well. She'll throw a fit about this. I know. But it's worth it if it means she'll change. It looks so good. Just put a little powdered sugar on top. And we're done! Yay. Oh you have... on your face. Here. Alright. So what's that thing called anyway? I don't know how to pronounce it. It's some soufflé. It's good. It's really good! Well thank-you. So, I was wondering... About? Home... for you. New York. Despite the accent. My dad was from London and my uncle sent me to schools out in England. I think he wanted me to keep a connection with family. You never picked up the American accent? I can if I want to. It just never seemed very natural to me. You know? Is your uncle still around? Oh yes. Won't he be missing you? I hadn't actually thought about that. I mean, not that I'd count on a search party finding you in the Alps, but... No, I don't even think he knows I'm in the country. Does anybody? Yes, a friend. But I'm pretty sure she's not looking for me either. I was in a bit of a huff with her when we last parted. She probably thinks I'm out here having fun without her. What did you guys fight about? Oh, you know, me being me. We're actually a really odd pair? How's that? Well, during summers, I would spend them with my uncle at his house. And the other kids just... It was like I had the plague. They had no idea how to talk to me. But Catherine was nice. She listened, she told me what she thought when she thought it. She never beat around the bush. So we just always stayed friends. We're really different. How so? She's working class and I'm rich. Remember? Yeah, but, you're more than right? Well I'd like to think so. You know it's a wonder that we're friends at all. The way we treat each other... She's really sarcastic. And I think she thinks I don't know but... But you're rich, not stupid. Exactly. Yes, well put. So how do you treat her? Good. Really well when you consider all of the money I, my uncle gave her mom. Her mom? She got ill and they had loads of bills. She says I hold that over her head but... Do you? Really, I treat her really well because sometimes I buy her little gifts and things. Yeah, but that probably doesn't matter much to her, does it? No, probably not. But you know, that's probably why I consider her a friend. Like, a good friend. A true friend? Yeah. Then you should tell her that. When you said you were a doctor did you really mean therapist? Shoot! Jeremy, I do hope you understand why one day. I forgive you. Don't let this or the malpractice eat at you forever. Carrie. Isabelle? Um... Yeah? Hey. Oh, my goodness. You have not got a stitch of flannel on you. It's gone. I have to do laundry. No, it looks so much better. Alright, don't make a big deal about it. What are you doing? Um... I was just sitting and writing a letter. How are you going to send that? Pigeon... carrier pigeon. Do the pigeons come to your birdhouses to eat from... Not at mine. Right... Well nevermind then. What are you doing? I wanted to see if you want to play chess. Don't you have like a game box thing? Like video games? Yes. No. Why not? Well, for one, because I'm not fourteen. Right... Chess it is then. Lucky me. Jeremy Edmunds is hereby suspended from practicing medicine and stripped of his medical license. So what do you do? Do? Yeah, you know, for a job. No need. Did you go to college? Yes, three actually, but none of them suited me. Three, huh? Well it's hard to study for a job that you know you'll never actually going to need. Sounds rough. But I'm also on the board of directors for a charitable foundation. Nice. What foundation? Um, the Elliott Foundation. Your family's? Yes but that doesn't make it any less impressive. Of course not. You know it's not like I don't do anything. I have a life. Okay, so, what do you do on a normal day? I get up, get ready, you know, meet friends for lunch, go shopping... Sometimes we go to the spa. And sometimes I do appearances for um, like parties or benefits you know, those sorts of things. So, uh, socialite. You know I really don't care for that term particularly. Change what you do then. I would but... What was that? That's the dryer. You mind pulling the clothes out while I finish here? Yeah, okay, um... Okay. Oh no! What happened? I was carrying that, and it's so heavy. And the hallway is really narrow, and I... You broke it? It can be fixed, right? Not really! Well don't you have some of that wood glue? You can't just... hey stay away from that alright? I don't want you to break anything else. It was an accident I didn't mean to. Yeah, well your excuses aren't going to fix this. Jeremy, It's just a birdhouse. You know, I realize that this doesn't look like it's worth much to you, but it means a lot to me. You probably can't get that. I do get it and don't talk to me like that. Like what? Like I'm too stupid or shallow to understand your whole thing. Well sorry princess, but the shoe fits. You know what? That's nothing compared to what you've ruined. What's that supposed to mean? I may have ruined a lousy birdhouse but you've ruined people's lives, doctor. You don't know what you're talking about. You wish. I found your secret, guilty stash. What were you doing going through my things? Finding out what you were hiding. Those are my things. You were snooping through my past. I think that I have a right to know exactly who I'm staying with. A right? I could have buried you in the snow and nobody would have cared. Is that what you said when you killed that girl? Nobody will even care? Who are you to judge? You don't do anything! Your whole life revolves around shallow people and how much money you can spend. It's useless. Your whole existence is pathetic. You are the epitomy of rudeness. You are so full of yourself you actually think that the whole world revolves around you. You are the most self centered person I have ever known. You don't do anything, your whole existence is pathetic. God, if you're listening, I don't want to be this way anymore. Isabelle? Isabelle? It's just a deer. Isabelle? Hello? Isabelle! Jeremy. My hands are still numb. Here you go. Thanks. Was there an animal out there? Like a wolf? No. Are you sure? There's not a lot of wolves that come out this way. Then why were you in such a hurry? It's freezing out there. It's only going to get colder. So you weren't scared? Not of a wolf. I'm sorry. It's just... don't do that again, ok? No. Jeremy, I'm... I'm really sorry. About everything. I was angry. I shouldn't have... Nope, you were right. You probably don't say that very often, do you? Nope. So I started getting these, um, really bad headaches. I don't know if it was a reaction to something... the flu. They'd last for days. So I got a prescription... pretty heavy painkillers. They worked well. Really well. But then I kept taking them. I felt better with them. Bad without. It got to a point where I couldn't get off them. I didn't want to. My wife noticed, and I got defensive. It became a wedge in our relationship. Another one. I ran out of pills and I had a surgery scheduled. Fairly routine, but not without the risk. But I was a wreck without the pills. So I found an old prescription laying around. Just something to take the edge off. But, um, just couldn't focus. Never should have entered the operating room that day. I thought I could handle it. The patient died on the table. From there I was sued for malpractice. I lost my license. My wife was just horrified with the whole thing. Not that I blame her. She was dragged through a lot. I moved here after the divorce. Did you try and get some help? Before the surgery I didn't think I needed it. But after, yeah. Court ordered rehab. How was that? Better than the alternative. It took a while for me to listen. Not just about the pills, but about what I did. Talked a lot about forgiveness, and God. Do you think God has forgiven you? Yeah. Rehab, of all places, helped my relationship with God. But yeah, after all this time I believe that God has forgiven me. But, I can't imagine anybody else has. You mean, her family? Her family, friends... I'm sorry, that's a lot to carry. Yeah. It's probably why rehab suggested taking up new hobbies. That's where you learned that. Yeah. Something to take your mind off it. Better than the other hobbies they were suggesting. That was my first one. I am so sorry I broke it. Don't worry about it. I over-reacted. I'm also sorry that I snooped. Not quite the happy story you were looking for, huh? I just should have respected your privacy. I just tend to do whatever I want. I've always done whatever I want. I picked up on that pretty quickly. You noticed? So you mind if I ask about your parents? It was a car accident and I was four. That must have been hard. I think that's what everybody thought and so they basically gave me whatever I wanted. So I just took the attention and the pity and used that to fill the void. It's no substitute for parents though. No. I thought the money was. I mean that's all I had left of them. That sounds really heartless, doesn't it? No. You know sometimes I wonder what they would think of me know, if they were here. I mean, just because they're not, that's not an excuse. Is it? Yeah. Anyway... Yeah. You want some help up the stairs? Oh no, I've got it. Jeremy, you know you're not that man any more, right? Yeah. I'm still ashamed of him though. No, no, Mr. Ling actually the technicians sprayed for those too. Well it does take about forty-eight hours to see the results. Well I can have another technician out to your... Mr. Ling? Have an awesome day. Hello, it's Isabelle. Leave a message but I probably won't call you back. Something smells so good. That's because I'm cooking. Cheeky. Come on down. Alright, but on one condition. After dinner, I teach you how to play chess. Okay... Why did you do that? So I could kill that guy. Alright, what are your next couple moves? I don't know, I'm not there yet. Well you're supposed to be thinking ahead like have it planned out. Here let's start again. * MUSIC Don't forget to read the ingredients this time. I know what I'm doing. Alright, try that out. It's much better. Good. Check. Check. You're doing better. Check mate! Um... That's not actually check mate, but good! It's good. It is? Yeah, really good. I made it. Nice job. Mr. Elliott? Yes. You have a phone call from Miss Isabelle's credit card company. Mr. Wilcox thought you should speak with him. Put it through. Hello. What did they say? You know exactly what they said. I thought you should here it from them this time. She's been there almost two weeks. I tried calling her but... She won't return the call. She's not going to change. And I think you agree that she needs to. I had Melinda draw up an agreement. You want to cut her off? Not completely. Just until she's ready to be responsible. You know if she receives that next portion as planned it will be gone in mere months. You said yourself she's been indulged. Her entire life has been that way. It's time to intervene. Isabelle? Yeah... Hey. Hey you. So it's scheduled for the delivery guy to come tomorrow. Oh, right. Of course. You're probably ready to get home. Uh, yeah. You're probably excited to have your home back to yourself. Yeah. Well I just thought you'd like to know. Thanks. Hey. Hi. What are you up to? Just catching up on some reading. What is that? The bible. In Chinese? Yeah. You speak Chinese? Well, I can read it. I told you I had a lot of extra time when I moved here. Right. And birdhouses weren't enough for you. Yeah. I learned the characters, but... But you don't speak it. Or write it. It's harder than it looks. No, I believe you. So I came to invite you to my own farewell party. I made the guest list? Oh yes. Barely though, it was close there for a while. Wow. I also thought about calling it the "Thanks for not letting me die or be eaten by a bear outside in the cold party." I think I like the first one better. Yeah, that sounded more fun. Okay. So Yes? Yeah, yeah. Okay. So do you want to come down in like an hour. Sure. Okay. - You want some help? - No, I'm good. You sure? Yup. I'll see you. Wow! Did you make all this from scratch? I turned the oven on. I thought about making it from scratch but then I found most of it sitting in your freezer. All of this was in my... Wow. You look, uh, nice. Thank-you. Am I the first one here? That was really good. Thank-you. You're welcome. Where are you going? To get dessert. You made dessert? You know, it's not a party unless you have dessert. I agree. S'mores. Yeah. You know how to do this right? The girl from London is asking me about s'mores. Ready? Yeah. Thank-you. You're going to burn it. You're critiquing my cooking? No, your s'more making. It's very different. I like it crunchy. That's burnt to a crisp. Okay. Perfect. Cookies? You don't have any Graham Crackers. Oh, yeah. For me? It looks so messy. Is it good? It's good. It's a little messy. I'm sticking to chocolate. I've been wondering... why did you let me stay in the end? When you broke in? Oh you love to put it that way, don't you? Well as much as you ticked me off I'm not heartless. So I'm lucky it was you then. I mean, honestly, as impossible as I thought it was, I've actually felt really at home here. So, is that why you were so bossy? Me? Bossy? Okay, so what you call bossy I think was just some valid fashion advice. I mean, we had to break you from all that flannel and get rid of that whole Paul Bunyan thing you had going on. I mean look how much better you look now. It's like night and day. I guess I was just lost without you. I'm glad you ended up here. Even though I drove you crazy most of the time? Yeah. It was worth it. I don't want you to leave tomorrow. You want me to stay here? Yeah. But my whole life is back in New York. Well, they haven't missed you yet. But eventually they will. And as much as I've loved being here with you I can't just stay forever. Yeah, you're right. Jeremy... I'm not like you. I can't just leave it all behind. Do you really want to go back to that life? Look, it's all I know. I have too much... Too much. Is it always about money with you? I never said anything about money. I have people who care about me. Unlike you I can't just leave them behind and hide away up here. Why don't you just go back home? I have nothing to go back to. That's not true. You could start over, start fresh. I'm sure everybody has moved on by now. I doubt it. What if I run into the family or someone who remembers? Even that would be better than being isolated up here with nothing but your past just hanging over you. I don't expect you to understand because you don't face consequences. I do too. Really? Or do you just make excuses and throw money at a problem until it disappears? Well it's better than just running away with your tail between your legs. Just wasting your life instead of giving yourself a chance to have one and actually being happy. Who are we kidding? You're going to go back to your socialite crowd, your rich lifestyle. You have everything you need. You'll forget about me. I will. It's late. The delivery guy gets here early. Dietrich! Sauerkraut? Ya! I don't eat this stuff. Try it. I didn't order it this time or the last five times. Well, keep it for emergency. Great, so if I run out of everything else I'll have six jars of sauerkraut. We're just about done here. Good. Oh, did you want me to send these clothes back to you? No. Keep them. Isabelle... Goodbye. Get out of here Dietrich. Really I'm fine Uncle Lyle. No, my ankle doesn't even hurt anymore. It was all just a big accident but I'm home now. Alright... I'll come and see you tomorrow, alright? Okay. Bye. No, no you are correct. In fact, I am making a note on your account as we speak. So, mm hmm... Okay. Thank-you so much for calling. You have a great day. Oh my gosh, you're back and you're safe. I'm fine. Did you really get lost? I never should have left you. Um, as I recall I'm the one who left you behind. Yeah and then you got lost. I just assumed you got back to the hotel okay. Catherine, seriously, don't worry about a thing. But you're fine? I was, um... well taken care of. Yeah? You know I can probably sneak away early if you want to tell me about it. I have to go and see Uncle Lyle next. Oh, yeah yeah... But I will call you later, alright? Okay, yeah sure. - See you. - Bye. I would have riled up every agency there is to find you if I'd only known. I should have told you where I was going. When I didn't hear from you I assumed... Well I didn't think it was anything serious. It's my own fault. I didn't expect you to think anything was wrong. You could have been hurt, or worse. I was lucky. Hello. Glad to see you've returned safely. Thank-you. Perhaps this isn't the right time for us to discuss this. I think it is the right time. We've discussed this at length. She just returned from a very traumatic ordeal. It doesn't change anything. Wait, what's going on? Per the provisions in your parents trust we are revoking you're next inheritance installment. What provisions? If the three trustees unanimously agree we can delay the payout until such a time as we deem appropriate. And we have agreed. Isabelle, your outlandish spending, combined with your unacceptable public behavior... It's not what your parents would want. We'll provide for your living expenses. It'll be a minimal amount but you'll be fine. And beyond that, perhaps you should find a better use of your time. Something more meaningful. Look, this whole Switzerland thing... It's demonstrated just how reckless you've become. We feel that this is about your safety and protection as much as the preservation of your future. Alright. Alright? It's fine. The money was meant to provide for you Isabelle, but it won't keep you happy forever. I know. Eleven carats... And she's not going to give it back? No! She thinks she can keep it. But he called off the engagement. Probably to get that giant rock back. She's not worth eleven carats. Oh poor Dan though. Right Isabelle? Yeah. He should sue her. I heard that he might on grounds of an affair. She didn't! Hey... are you busy tonight? Your uncle really cut you off? Yup. But I don't blame him. You are unusually calm about this. No seriously you are starting to freak me out. What happened to you over there? I realized I have everything that money can buy. Yeah? So isn't it a little odd that I don't have everything I want? What more could you want? To be happy. I mean, when I got there it drove me crazy. But then it was so peaceful and calm and quiet. I actually really liked it. The quiet? Or the quiet with a good looking guy? Did I say he was good looking? You just did. Yeah he is. So give me the rundown on this guy. I was horrible to him and he told me so. And it made me feel disappointed. How? In myself. You know? Like for the first time, maybe ever, it actually bothered me that I had hurt someone else. I've been pretty terrible to you too. Not terrible... Terrible. I held money over your head just like you said. And basically guilted you into doing whatever I wanted you to do. Why? Because I wanted you around. Because... maybe I didn't want to lose the one real friend that I had. And you thought the money thing was the way to do it? Yes I did. Isabelle, I am friends with you in spite of the money. Really? Yeah. Wow, this guy really got through to you. Do you miss him? Yeah. You should try and see him. I'm pretty sure he'd rather just forget all about me. He asked me to stay, but... You said no. Yup. And now you've changed your mind? Well I only said I didn't want to stay there. It didn't mean I didn't want to be with him at all. Isabelle, I have seen you chase loser guys all the time. This one's better than that and you really like him. So isn't he worth fighting for? I don't know what to do God. I know what I want, but, I can't forgive myself for what I did. How can anybody else? Help me... Help me be strong. Help me not be afraid. Help me to forgive myself that I might be happy again. Hi Isabelle, Just calling about an event we're having tomorrow for the foundation. You can call me and I can give you more details about it. You're doing good. I feel a little out of my element. Well that's a good thing every now and then. There you go. Thank-you. Thank-you. He's just a kid. Yes... I think it was easier when I just thought of them as a faceless bunch. Opens your eyes doesn't it? Yeah. I'm glad you could come. Me too. You know, I've actually been thinking, if it's alright with you, I'd like to be a little bit more involved in the foundation. I don't know how much help I'd be. I know I don't know very much, but I'd kind of like to try. Of course. Yeah? Are you happy Isabelle? I'm trying to be. I only ask because you've been different since you came back. Isn't that good thing? I mean... Somewhat yes. But I still need to know that you're happy. I mean truly happy. Me too. What happened out there? I met someone and he was nice. Just nice? I think maybe I think about him a little too much. Well that could mean something. Not really. We're too far apart. You don't have to be. It's not like I can pick up the phone and call him. He is in the middle of nowhere. Go see him. I'll call and have the plane ready. Uncle Lyle... Go! I'm not even sure he would want to see me. Well you won't know until you do see him. Thank-you. Exucse me? Oh, guten Tag! Hello, I'm looking for Jeremy. Ya. He's gone. Gone? He asked me to watch the cabin. Gone where? To America, I think. Why? I don't know. He left this morning. Okay, thank-you. Hey what happened? He's not here. What, are you serious? Apparently he's on his way back to the US. To find you. I don't know. I mean, I'd like to think so but he could be going anywhere. So, um, what are you going to do? Well I'm on my way back now but I don't want to miss him. Yeah, how soon can you get back? Not soon enough. Look, I know that you're at work, but is there anyway that you could just go to my place just in case he shows up? Yeah, I can totally do that. Thank-you. Mr. Elliott? Go ahead. You have a visitor here, a Jeremy Edmunds. He says he's here about Isabelle. Send him in. Hello Mr. Elliott. I'm sorry to barge in on you like this. How do you know Isabelle. She stayed at my home for a little while. I'm sorry, I don't know if she told you about her trip to Switzerland, You're the man she met. Yeah... Do you know where I could find her? Catherine! Hey. He isn't here. But maybe... he could have gotten here before I could get here but then... Why wouldn't he be back by now. Well maybe he was delayed, he was on a commercial flight right? Probably. Then he's on his way. Maybe I'm not the reason he was coming out here at all. Well, what other reason would there be? I don't know. I can think of a few. Maybe he never forgave me for the way I left, the things that I said. No, Isabelle, you're being too hard on yourself. You've never said that to me before. Well, it was never true until today. Listen, go get some rest some rest you've got to be tired. And besides, you've jumped a million time zones. Hi. Hi. You're here. Yeah. I mean, he said you were coming, but... Who? Your delivery guy. Dietrich? You spoke to him? Yeah, um... I went to find you. Well I came here. Wow, I'm really tired, I've got to go. I've been babysitting this apartment all day and there's no food in the house because Isabelle can't cook. So, I'm just going to go get some take-out probably, on my way home. Sorry... but you guys have great night though. Listen I'm sorry. I... I was cruel and selfish. I've always been cruel and selfish. You are the first person to make me want to be something else, and... No, I was being selfish. I was asking you to leave everything behind but I wasn't willing to do the same. Maybe it doesn't even matter any more. It does... because you deserve somebody with a future and for me to have a chance at that, I've got to be willing to let go of the past. So does that mean you want me in your future? Yeah! But, it's not going to be easy. But if God could forgive me I should be able to forgive myself. Living in hiding really isn't living at all. Well neither is living without the person that you love. I'm so glad I found you. Wait! Are you sure that you're ready for me? I mean, I'm kind of... I've survived so far. Yeah? Okay.
