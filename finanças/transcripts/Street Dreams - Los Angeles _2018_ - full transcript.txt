Nah, I ain't gonna need no backup on this one. Move and that next bullet is going in your ass. You've got the right to remain silent, anything you say can and will... I didn't even fuckin' do nothin'. Who the fuck are you? Who am I? I'm detective Elijah Wilkins, and I got everything needed to take you in, Spencer Williams. My names Spank, bitch. Yeah, whatever, get up. You can't come in here causing... Hey, shut up, Elijah, because I'm doing you a favor, all right? Freeze, I said freeze. Stop. Got your ass. So you killin' folk, you sellin' dope, and you attacked an officer. Oh yeah, I'm about to make sure the booty boys have a good time with you in prison. Let's go. Do you wanna explain to me why I just got off the phone with an angry bartender saying that a police officer opened fire in his bar around unarmed civilians? Lieutenant Roberts, why do you always keep it so dark in here? 'Cause this is my office, and it's my rules so shut up. What happened to the backup that I called for you? - What, man, I don't... - Shut up, okay? That was rhetorical, I'm not done talking. I don't, I don't get it, I don't get it. You have a background in criminal justice, you have a family, you're actually a halfway decent detective, but you're selfish and a reckless ass whole. If I'd of knew you'd be this much of a headache I would of never approved your transfer from New York. What do you got to say for yourself, Wilkins? I mean, basically I just wanted to say... Shut up, okay? I'm still not done talking. I want you to know that I know that you've been putting in application to get into the FBI. And they called me for recommendations. What they say? They asked and I told them the truth. That you're not ready. What, are you serious? I need this. No, I need you to get your shit together. I can't have you going over there pulling the same mess that you do here, not on my name. I will change once I get... I need you to change now. I can't believe you're doing this. I'm gonna give you like, one or two years, and then we'll see what's good with the transfer. A year? Look, you got the skills and the experience to get you in the door, but it's your character that will determine how long you stay there, Elijah. Whatever dude. You still arguing with Wilkins over that FBI transfer. Mind your own business. Why don't you let that man go? Some of those FBI guys are no better than him. True, but honestly, he's the best detective I've got. Daddy, what are you doing? Sup baby girl? I have to protect you from bad guys. Come here. You still remember what I taught you? All right, let me see what you got, ready? Bam. Boom, jab right, boom, boom, boom, down low, too slow. Now look, you gotta promise me not to be out here using the swing at friends, okay? Only if you gotta defend yourself. Come on, sit down, let's have a talk with daddy. Daddy, when you go and defend a bad guy, sometimes I get scared that you won't come back home. Come here baby girl. Listen, I don't want you ever have to worry about your father, okay? I can't promise you that I'm always gonna be here, but I can let you know is that I'm working hard enough so I ever were to depart, you will be taken care of, okay? I love you. Daddy, you hug me too tight. You know you like it, come here. Raa. Momma wants us to come in the house for dinner. All right, come on, let's go see mommy. Can I take Madison inside too. What? Little girl, if you don't get in this house. Mm, smells good up in here. Did you all wash her hands? I did but Daddy didn't. Baby, you snitching on me. Elijah, go wash your hands. Oh my gosh. All right, what we eatin' for dinner tonight? Spaghetti. Spaghetti? Baby, I thought you were gonna make me some tacos? Uh-uh, don't be ungrateful, be glad I made you dinner. Oh, you're lookin' out for your man. Come here girl. Ew. Babe stop, eat your food before it gets cold. So, how was work? I don't wanna talk about it right now. Daddy didn't take out some bad guys. Baby you know I did. What happened after you busted them? I don't wanna talk about it now, just eat your spaghetti. I do. What happened? Well, if you must know, Lieutenant denied my transfer to the FBI. How long are you gonna do this FBI stuff? Babe, I'm not gonna have this conversation with you right now, I'm really not. I'm tired of hearing about the FBI all the time. If you need to start raising your voice in front of my daughter. Don't tell me to stop getting worked up in front of our daughter. Baby, why don't you go inside your room while I talk to your mum. Mm-mm, Jasmine, don't move a muscle, eat your food. Okay. I think I just lost my appetite. Baby, sit here while I go talk to your dad. She trippin' boy. What is your problem? So now you wanna talk about it? Why can't you just stick to being a detective? It's bad enough I hardly see you as it is. Or I have to worry about going to view your body at the morgue. Baby, why you acting brand new? You know I wanted to be an FBI agent since we met in high school. I do, but you been pursuing this career for over 10 years. All I'm saying is, be thankful for what you have. It's not like we're struggling. Besides, do you really think they're gonna let a black man from the hood, in the counter intelligence - or the FBI? - Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold one. Fist of all, I'm different, and I thought you had my back. See that's the problem. We always have your back. What about me? Seems like all I'm good for is giving you babies, feeding you, and a good fuck. Now you know you mean more to me than that. Then prove it. Why haven't I got a ring yet? At least give me something to look forward to. I'm tired of my mum and my sisters always harassing me about my life, asking, when's he gonna marry you? Baby, if I was married they would not have made me detective, and you know this. It has to jeopardize the whole situation. Like I said, it's always about you. Oh, it's about me, huh? You know, it's really funny how you're saying that but you don't say that when I'm taking you out on them shopping sprees. Or what about this Mercedes Benz I bought you from my promotion, huh? Oh, you love driving that. Are you coming back to eat with me? Baby, please go back to the kitchen, Daddy and Mummy are just talking, we'll be right down. Look baby, I'm sorry, okay? I just need you to believe in me like you believe in me for that job. I'm so close I can feel it. I love you. And I need you. So believe me when I say, I will make you my wife, okay? I guess this is a bad time to tell you I'm pregnant. You're what? Baby you pregnant? We're gonna have a kid? Yeah. Okay, nah, that's all good, you know what I'm saying? 'Cause once I'm in the FBI, you know what I'm saying? I'm gonna be making an extra 10 G's a year and then training, I'm getting two K a week. Baby, we gonna be good, baby, we gonna baby, Mrs. Wilkins. Uh-uh, don't start nothin' you can't finish right now. Wait until Jasmine goes to bed. I like that. Where that damn remote at? Yeah. Y'all tryna roll this dice though, what's up? You all brought money? I'm gonna let y'all know right now I'm taking all your money. Shut up Max, all you do is run your mouth, let's see what you got. He ain't gonna win anyway, he bad luck. Hello Danny, I'm taking your money first. All right. Let's go. Nigga, them were snake eyes, nigga. Ay, how much you puttin' up B? Nah, I'm just gonna watch. I'm saving my money for the ice cream truck. Nigga, why you always gotta act a buster? What you need to do is roll this dice and flip that money so you can buy you a shit load of ice cream. I'm good. Ay my nigga, why keep bothering this nigga, bro, He ain't tryna shoot bros. Just shut up and keep rolling. Okay. Hey, I like these bro, where you get these from? Hey, where you nigga's from? Hey nigga, what you mean where we from. Nigga, don't play stupid, where you nigga's from? Man what's good? Hey my nigga, we got a problem or what my nigga? Yo, can't be killin', let's just go. Hey man fuck that, I ain't going nowhere my nigga. Take your bitch ass home nigga, I ain't scared of none of you bitch ass nigga. Pussy. Hey my nigga, don't let these nigga's punk y'all bro. Oh Danny, you cold man. Oh shoot, they comin' back. - Danny, get up man. - Danny. Come on open your eyes. Come on Danny. Danny what's wrong? Danny come on, get up, Danny, we gotta go. Danny. Danny. Baby, it's okay. I'm sorry baby, I'm sorry. Go back to sleep. I'm sorry. Wake up Cinderella. Apparently there's another player in the Spencer Williams murder ring. There's always another player. You got any leads? Some fella by the name of Ace. They say he hangs around Mid Town. Mid Town? Well I got a plug down there. Hmm, well good. Get down there and get as much information as you can so we can finally close this case. All right, I'll get down there a little later. No, no, no, no, I need you to go now. Lieutenant, I just woke up. I don't care, when I call you that means you on the clock so you get your ass down there now. All right, damn. Baby, I gotta go in. Hmm. I gotta go into work. Don't be gone all day. You know I'm comin' back, 'cause it's my duty to please this booty. Oh, you're so corny. Baby, what you watchin'? I don't know, some guys dutiful head. That's Donald Trump baby. Unfortunately he's our president. Oh, I've heard of him. The kids at my school say he doesn't like people that look like me. I don't understand. I'm just a kid and never did anything. I know baby. Some peoples hearts are led by ignorance, you know? But I don't want you using that as an excuse not to excel. You're a Wilkins, and Wilkins, we overcome anything. Just want you to make sure you judge people by their character and not by the color of their skin, you got that? Okay Daddy. All right, turn on some cartoons. I love you, I'll be back, listen to what your mother says. Bye. Ay yo, step into my office. Man, what you want man? Why you gotta ask all these questions? Just get in the whip and holla at me for a second. Nah, whatever you gotta say you can say it right here. I don't think you want everybody knowin' your business, if you know what I'm sayin'. What you want now man? Yo, why you always gotta sit in the back seat? 'Cause snitches sit in the front, and I ain't no fuckin' snitch. Ain't nobody even thinkin' about your ass. Besides, nobody even know I'm a cop besides you. Yeah, aight, that's what you think. So what's up, you got something to say? 'Cause if not, I'm out. Like you got somethin' better to do than sit your ass up on that street corner. So why don't you do something good for your community for once? Man, you playin', I'm out. What you know about Ace? Who? Ace, do you know him? Never heard of him. Okay. You deaf, dumb, blind, and stupid again. You know, well you can get the hell out of my whip. This fuckin' nigga man. On second thought, hold up. Hold on, let me holla at you for a second. You know, I figured some of this fresh air may jog your memory. So who's Ace? Man, I already told you I don't know. Why do you keep messing with me, Jah? Why I keep messing with you? You know, it's funny how quickly you forgot you on two strikes, and I can be even funnier and get those charges buried up on my desk and make that three. How many years you get for three strikes again? So I'm suppose to be scared now, nigga? You don't have shit on me. I know them streets like I know them laws. Besides, I've been to jail already, it ain't nothin' I ain't seen. Okay. - Yeah. - So you cool with talking to your family between a glass wall is what you sayin', huh? Did I stutter, nigga? Let me make this more clear for you. You ain't gettin' shit outta me, so matter of fact, don't even come around here no more, tough guy. Aight, three strikes comin' for that ass. Good luck, Jah. Old Hopper messed up. So what have we got here? Yeah, what's up? Good news, we got Ace down here for questioning and I think we got enough to put him away for good this time. Well I'll be damned. You sound mad. You're mad somebody got to him before you? No I just wasted my entire day doing nothin'. Where? Some old trap house. Wait, the one near Anderson? Yep, supposedly this is where Ace ran his supply. I think he cleaned it out about two weeks ago after he found out we were shuttin' down all his allies. Well that's good to know. Look, I'll be over there shortly, stand by, aight? Hurry up, handle that. What's this? C4. Dodger Stadium. Put this back. So you're the one they call Ace, huh? Why do they call you that? 'Cause I'm the highest suit in the deck. Ace bigger than a king. Yeah, until someone pulls a joker on you. Ain't got no time for jokers. See they all get knocked off. So, since you gonna be questioning to death, the least you could do is hand me a cigarette. Who says I have a cigarette? I know a smoker when I see one. I don't normally do this. That's what they always say. Then they come crawling back, like fucking bees. Lieutenant, Lieutenant? Oh relax, you relax, this case is about to be over. Are you busy? Well, I'm about to get some coffee and then I'm gonna go back in there with Agent Mendez and finish interrogating Ace. Wait, Agent Mendez, FBI Mendez? Well apparently Ace was into bigger things than just local murder and drugs. I don't doubt it one bit. I think I got something to prove it. This glass goin' bye. Wait, what? Wait a minute Wilkins. Wilkins. So you a terrorist too? What the hell you talkin' 'bout? You can't just come in here during a private investigation. Lieutenant, have your man stand down now. Wilkins, stand down. Nah, I got some vital information you may need, Agent Mendez. - I'm sorry. - What is this? Agent Mendez, this is Detective Wilkins, he was the lead detective on this case since the beginning. I don't know what these are though. They're blueprints to the Dodger Stadium. Apparently this dude was planning to blow it up or somethin'. I don't know what the hell he talkin' about. I ain't no damn terrorist. And I don't give a fuck about Dodger Stadium. So what were they doing at your trap house? Man, why don't you ask the nigga you snatched them from? Dumb ass. - You know who I am? - I can take it from here Detective. You keep your monkey ass paws off my client. Else I'll have your badge. Who the hell are you? I'm Thomas Johnson, attorney of law. There'll be no further questioning till otherwise stated. Johnson. Oh, Mendez. Why am I not surprised to see you here? Always defending the scum of the earth. Mendez, you don't wanna start a battle you can't win. So now I suggest we wrap up this little party so my client here, Mr. Big mouth, will be on his way. Nah, I don't think that's a good idea. He committed the crime, he's gotta pay the time. Now I see we have an overly anxious cop. Struggling to prove himself. My suggestion to you, rookie, is to stand down if you know what's good for you. You know what? I ain't scared of no damn lawyers, all right? I am the law. Nigga, you ain't shit but a sellout with a badge. You know, I'm 'bout tired of you running your mouth. Wilkins, stand down, matter of fact in my office right now. Wilkins, now. Lookin' like an RnB singing ass nigga. - Right now, bring your ass. - Get your ass, B. - Before I do it. - Hey, hey, hey, hey. Mendez, will that be a problem if I have some personal time with my client here. Some personal time? Yeah. Suggest you tell your client to keep his mouth shut. It wouldn't be a problem if can get two diet cokes? What the fuck am I gonna do with you? Every time I turn around, you in fuckin' trouble. I got enough shit goin' on with other clients that I can't even tend to because I gotta babysit your ass. Now fill out this paperwork so I can get you outta her by tonight. You know what? When all this is over you're gonna throw me a big ass party. That's what you gonna do. Are you outta your damn mind? You really trying to mess this up for yourself, aren't you? Like I said, you're too reckless. Okay, I'm sorry. Maybe I got a little excited, all right? Yeah, well your excitement is making you, me, and the whole, entire precinct look like we're idiots. Somebody's planning an attack on the Dodger Stadium. For all we know I just saved a bunch of lives. But how you did it is not how you handle the situation. For all we know, it coulda been a little kid playing with those blueprints. - Lieutenant? - Mendez. We had to let Ace go. But as far as these blueprints, we're gonna look a little further into these. I have a strong feeling this may be someone else's doing. But Detective? Wilkins, Elijah Wilkins. Detective Wilkins, you got time tomorrow to talk more about your investigation? Sure do. Here's my card. Give me a call first thing in the morning. No problem. Lieutenant. Agent Mendez. I'll call you later on. Look forward to it. Ah, Agent Mendez? Agent Mendez? Agent Mendez? Can I help you Wilkins, I'm kinda in a hurry? I'm sorry, I don't mean to hold you up. I just wanna know how long you been with the bureau? Little over 10 years. So that means you're pretty well connected with a couple recruiters and things like that, right? I am one of the recruiters. Really? Look, you're tryna get into the FBI, right? Yeah. You kind of remind me of a recruit I had. Well I bet he made a fine agent. Actually, he's dead. He died in the line of duty. Are you sure you want this life? You damn right I want this life. Everybody thinks the grass in greener on the other side. But I want smart recruits who can take matters into their own hands while still working as a team. Recruits who won't end up like that dead recruit I just spoke of. Like I said, I can be that dude. You have my card. After this case is done we can talk. Thank you. Hey, I'm ain't gonna let you down, aight. You better not be harassing that woman about getting into the FBI, Wilkins? No, I'm not harassing her. And yes I asked about the FBI. And what'd she say? Nuttin', it's about me proving myself. Now, if you excuse me, I got something I gotta take care of. Look, I know you too well, you better not be plan around this case, don't follow her. You barking up a tree you ain't big enough to piss on son. Lieutenant, I'm a grown man and I do whatever I please. If you walk out that door, and you pursue this case, your job here as a detective, any chance you feel like you got to get into the FBI is over, you hear me? No risk, no reward, right? Mm-hmm. I quit. Wilkins, get back here. Wilkins, don't you. Good thing I keep a spare badge up in here. - Barry? - Yeah. Where's my briefcase? It's in there. What's in there. Your briefcase. It's in there. What's it doing in there? Well I brought it, I brought it there earlier because how I told you when I went back to see you. You're in deep shit now bro. Let's go. Take it easy on him boys. All right man. Okay. Where is the damn briefcase? Why in the hell did you bring it here? Let alone leave it. Sorry Connor. Okay. Sorry Connor, I came here to come pick up some stuff but... Some stuff? You been smokin' that garbage again. Just a little bit, just for my anxiety. Yeah, that hurt. Look everybody, everybody knows this is where you buy the good stuff. So I was, I figured I'd just come, get the stuff, and then go straight to you, go right back to your place. But um. But what? What could possibly go wrong? A cop, it was some cop. Some cop came with his gun drawn, I saw him, I ran for it, I tripped over that table, I tripped over that table, I dropped the briefcase. When I went back to try to recover, he was already around the, I just got, I got scared. Scared? Scared. Scared. He was big, yeah he was big, he had a gun, I had no gun. He had a gun, he was scared. Are you scared Barry? I didn't wanna get shot. I don't work well with bees. Freeze, police. Can him. Freeze. Freeze, freeze, freeze, don't you move a muscle. Freeze. This is Lieutenant Roberts. Lieutenant, I got a few men down at the old warehouse. Elijah, what are you doing over there? I got more evidence. What you not understand? I know, but I got another lead, plus I got a license plate. It's not about you having more leads, okay? Your job is done. Get away from there otherwise I'm gonna have your ass arrested for trespassing. Did you just hear me? I said I got more... It's over, you have no more access to the this precinct or it's resources. This case is in the hands of Agent Mendez now. You have nothin' to do with it, you're done, leave it alone. Damn. Who can I get to run these plates for me. Well I'll be damned. Yo, what's up yo. - Haven't seen this nigga... - In a while. Wait, hold on, hold on. You still a cop? Look man, I've been clean for three years. I just got out. You can shake it out, but I'm clean man. And all these other whips around here are clean. Most of 'em. First of all you need to chill, okay? I ain't here for no stolen cars. I need you to run some plates for me. Come on man, you know I don't do that shit no more. Cut this shit out. I mean, I know you ain't out here stealing cars no more, but I know got the technology. Technology, is this a fuckin' setup, because legally he gotta let me know if this is a set up or not, nigga. If you don't start acting like we used to run these ropes together. Oh boy, you a fool, I see you ain't changed one bit. We do go way back like four flats on a Cadillac, baby. But you ain't on a Cadillac baby. I know man, just a figure of speech. Oh man, I'm so surprised to see you, dude, I thought you were still out there San Bernardino. Man, it got too real out there man. I had, I got too much trouble. Yeah, but LA's where it's at though. I agree. Bo, check me out man. I see you man, I see you. You didn't big, you came a long ways. Like this part over here. Okay, what's that, a 2006 GTO? This dude don't know nothin' about no cars, man. You right, it's actually a '09 GA. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, I knew that, I knew that. Nah, nah, nah, nah, but you didn't though. - See I got jokes. - Oh man. Hey, yo, Cat, have you that's what he just called me. Yes, they just rang this morning. Perfect, cool, cool, cool, keep on stalling for me and keep me updated - about that. - Okay. Thanks. So you're the boss, huh? Check me out baby. So what's up big boss? You gonna run these plates for me or what? Why you need me, ain't no cop that can do that? Computers man, the job go down. Hold on, hold on. Hey, hey D, get your ass to work boy. Damn man. What? Nothing, here I go. Yeah that's what I thought you said Dante. Damn man, what am I payin' you all for. Ay, you too Fabio. What? Man, you playin' man. How 'bout this. How 'bout we race for it? You serious? I'm a detective, what do I look like street racing? Oh, you good then, you don't need my help. All right Max, you win. You're gonna get your little street race, all right? Good. So this is how it's gonna go down. If you beat me, I will help you with whatever you need help with. But if I win, you get my name cleared with all those tickets I have and wipe my record. I thought you said you was clean? Oh my gosh. Let's do this then. Let the games begin. Now you know I'm not gonna let you race me with that hoop you got. In fact, I'm gonna give you this SRT to play with. This guy. Okay, okay, okay, I see you got it, all right, all right. What's up boy, what's up? Well, well, well. Mr. Max still got a little sumin', sumin'. Little sumin', sumin'. Like your SRT man. You like that huh? Oh yeah. That's too much power for you man. Whatever. Look man, I know you won and all, but I still need you to run them for me, bro. You know, technically, I don't owe you shit. You lost. I lost. But since you my cousin-in-law, whatever, maybe I'll let you slide on this one. Let me slide? Yeah. Your call play boy. Come on man, let's head back to my shop. Let's roll. So what's up man, how's the job treating you? Honestly, I wasn't gonna say nuttin', but I quit. What? Man, stop playing. Nah, I quit today. So you wasn't planning on getting my charges dropped anyway? Honestly, I thought I was gonna beat you, but I see you still got a little sumin', sumin'. You damn right I still got it, man. Ever since we were kids all you talked about was you becoming a pig. - So you quit just like that. - Wait wait, hold on, hold on, first of all I ain't no pig, aight. And it's for a bigger 'cause. What's bigger than you wanting to be 5O. What you mean, FBI. Damn, you still chasing the sweet dreams, man. Come on man, you know me. So what you doing in the mean time? I'm working out this case. Okay, but you still gotta get rent, don't tell me you back here to get in the business? Oh no, I'm tryna move forwards, not backwards. You crazy dude, let me see the plates. Crazy ass. So what's up, man, how wifey? She gonna be pissed when she finds out. Oh yeah. I know my cousin Kayla, and the last thing she needs is a black ass nigga like you with no job. Man, if you don't shut up and find them damn plates. Come over here man, looks like we got somethin'. Mark Connor. This dude owes you money or somethin'? Nah, it's worst than that. Like what? Terrorism. Damn. So you got a terrorist on your hands? Yeah, print this up so I can pay this dude a visit. Aight. Yo, I appreciate you comin' through on this. Of course man. Anything for my cousin-in-law, or I should say ex cousin-in-law after this. Hold on, whatever you do do not tell Kayla about this, okay? I got you, relax, relax. I'm not gonna tell her nothin'. But sounds like some next level shit, and you know I want in. All right, I got you. Take it easy Big Dog. Ay, clean your car. He was military. Interesting. - Don't shoot, don't shoot. - Who are you? I'm the landlord, I came to check Connor's apartment. Seems like he abandoned it. My name is Detective Elijah Wilkins, have you seen Connor lately, he's in a lot of trouble? I haven't seen him in two months. He always did act weird. Two months. Weirdo. Well do me a favor ma'am, if you see him, give me a call. Yeah, I'll do that. If you see him before I do, you tell him that he owes me two months rent. Yes ma'am. You have a good night. You too. Sweet dreams. Who is it? Ms. Wilkins? Yes. I'm Agent Morris. I understand your son, Elijah, was the witness to the Jenkins murder> He's not my son, he's my nephew. He's been through a lot, what do you want with him? Well, is he here? Yes, he's here, he's in the backyard. Mind if I asked a couple questions with him? I promise you though, it'll go quick. All right, come on in. Thank you. How you doing. What do you want? Just wanted to ask you a couple of questions about your friend Danny. I don't wanna talk about it. Yeah, I understand, you're going through a lot I just wanna help you bring to justice who did this to your friend. Why does it even matter? He's dead now. Just forget about him, everyone else will. Elijah, I understand what you're going through. No you don't. You're a cop. Actually, I'm not even a cop. I'm an FBI agent. And I haven't always been in law enforcement. Back in the days I be like you, I was raised in the hood, running around here in the streets of Los Angeles. I'm from New York. I only come in the summer. Okay, well New York. The thing is, we're not that different. Just like you, I lost a friend when I was young. You know what I did about it? What? Got a Nine and flushed out anyone who was responsible. No, not quite, but I can tell you what I did do. I went into the neighborhood, set up all kinds of neighborhood watches, and then when I got old enough I joined the academy. And as I was going through the ranks, getting higher and higher, I became an agent. So what's your point. My point is, you ain't gotta end up like everybody around here. You can just put your mind to something and just strive to be something better. So you're saying, I can be a cop? Look, I'm tryna tell you you can be anything you wanna be, you just gotta put your mind through it, and go in set for it. You like being an agent? I don't do anything that I don't love. All right guys, that's enough questioning for him for tonight. You have a fine young man here. Yes he is, he's quite brave. I'm sorry I can't help you more. I really don't know the guys who shot him. That's okay, that's okay. Here's my card, if you get anymore information just give me a call, okay? Thank you sir. Let me walk you to the door. Why don't you come to bed? I'll be back in when I finish my water. Did I scare you? I heard you when you came out that bathroom. No you didn't silly. Oh, you still have this? Yep. I remember when you used to pin this on your mirror when we was kids. He was your hero. What happened to him? He died of cancer. I bet he'd be proud of you today. I ran into your cousin today, Max. You did? Yeah. What's he talkin' about? I have to call him. Same old stuff, working on cars. Mm. What's wrong? Hmm, oh nuttin', you know, I'm just thinking. I do, that's why I ask. You know, I'm just thinkin' of ways I can make my family happier. We're already happy, baby, aren't you? I mean, I'm good, but we can always be better. Baby I know what you want, and you're gonna get it, just not on your time, but the right time. You can't control everything, you're not God. Yeah, you're right, but when I get there you're gonna be with me, right? You know I will. Babe, what about Jasmine? She's asleep, come on. Baby, what is goin' on? Do you have somethin' to tell me? Oh my god, what, what is going on? Do you have something to tell me? I made love to you all night, why you upset? Yeah, and it's the last time you're gonna get any of this. What? I talked to my cousin earlier this morning. Girl, you ain't gonna believe what your punk arse boyfriend said to me. Oh my god, I told this dude not to say nothin'. Don't say nothin'. How you gonna keep something like this from me? Baby, 'cause I knew you were gonna act like you're acting right now. So we're keeping secrets now? No baby, I'm not keeping secrets - from you. - when I saw you hide are you sleeping with other women? What, I would never do that to you. So when were you gonna tell me you lost your job. I don't know, but I promise I was gonna tell you. When, while they were foreclosing the house? No. Elijah Malik Wilkins, you better call who ever you need to call to get some cheques comin' in this house, 'cause the last thing I'm gonna do is have my daughter sleeping out on the streets. Okay, first of all, you need to relax, okay? Now you know I'm not gonna let nothin' happen to Jas, I got a few stacks in the bank. It will keep us going till I move to the FBI. The FBI? Nigga, are you delusional? You're not even a cop anymore, how you gonna be in the FBI? Go get your job back. See man, here you always go with that bullshit, man. Yeah, yeah, whatever. Come on babe, how you gonna come in here and hit me with pillow and all? - I wanted to worst. - You couldn't just wake... You couldn't just wake me up like a - normal person? - Elijah, excuses, - that's all I'm hearing. - It ain't excuses, - Excuses. - I'm just keeping it real with you. I'm telling you what's poppin', and you're just... Hurry up. And you better not come back in this house without a job. Why don't you get in this house before you wake up our neighbors? Hello? Agent Mendez. Detective, what's going on, I heard you quit? Look, never mind that. I got a feeling Ace is not responsible for the attack on the Dodger Stadium. I think I know who is. Who? I'd rather talk to you in person about it, can I meet you somewhere? Yeah, meet me at my office at FBI headquarters. Cool, I'll be there, text me the address. Morning Wilkins. Good morning. What do you have? Well, I'm sure you happened with me in the precinct. So before we go any further, I have some information here, and I need this to allow me to get into the agency. Are you bribing me? You told me the other day that I had to prove to you that I'm worthy. I tracked this guy down, I got all his information, I need this to be my ticket in. Well that's not how it works. You have to go through the entry process just like everyone else. And besides, these are still nothing but assumptions and allegations, those blueprints don't mean a thing. Okay, see this video right here? So you're telling me you're gonna let this mad man go and blow up an entire stadium, is that what your telling me? My team will be all over that stadium in a heart beat. We are well equipped and knowledgeable to take down this man if necessary. Listen, I need this position. I have worked my entire life to get here, and I have nothing else but this dream. And if I don't get into this agency I'm gonna loose my woman, my daughter, and their respect. I understand your situation - but I can't... - No, no, I really don't think you do Agent Mendez. I can't just pull strings like that. It still has to go through other departments before you get in, and I'm gonna be honest with you, a lot of those guys are not fond of black men in their division. I had to go through as an Hispanic woman, so imagine what you'll go through. Hold on, first of all, you think I care about what the white man or anyone else thinks of me of that matter? I'm telling you, I'll work on this case for free, just give me your word that you'll allow me to work in the agency. Excuse me. Hey. Yeah, I'll pick her up. Hey I was thi... I'm sorry about that. You're on the case. Don't you tell a single soul you're on it, all right? Let me get a copy of that video and anything else you have. Wait, wait, wait, so I'm in. That's not what I'm saying. You're on this case. Okay, I can rock with that, look, text me your email address and all that good stuff and I'm gonna send you all these videos and we're gonna take this dude down. Me and you, we got this, all right? That's all for you. Wait, Wilkins? You better be careful what you ask for because you may just get it and anything else that comes with it. Right, I'll catch you later. All right baby girl, how was school, did you have fun? Yeah, okay. I'll take you home. Get down. Bag off. How was school, did you have a good day, that make you play games and stuff? Yeah? - Wow, okay? - Okay. Okay, squeeze up in there. All right, buckle up, okay? What the hell you want? Aye, aye, aye, slow your roll, nigga, you know who you're talking to? Why did you tell Kayla what happened? Nigga, that's my baby cousin, what you mean? I'm not gonna lie to her. Well guess what? Your honesty just my life a whole lot more complicated. Oh my god, now stop complaining, you're acting like a punk right now. Man Kayla will get over that shit. But listen, now I got something way more important for you. Like what? You remember the license plate you gave me the other day? What about it? I'm staring at it right now. Where? I'm off of Wilshire and Fairfax. You might wanna come over here before they bounce. All right man, I'm comin, whatever you do, do not loose 'em. All right Jas, you know how you talked about how much you wanna see Daddy in action? Today's your day, but you can't tell Mommy, okay? Kill 'em all. Daddy's gotta go, okay? I promise I'll be right back, but I need you to stay right here, you promise me that? I promise. Okay. 'Bout time you showed up. Shut up man, just shoot these bad guys. Damn, and they got a sniper too. Daddy, Daddy. Baby go back. Daddy, Daddy, Daddy. Dude I'm out. I'm going after Connor. Out of the car. Don't shoot me, please don't, don't shoot me. Stay right here baby. I got you. Did you get him? Nigga, does it look like I got him? And by the way, is that your black Camaro over there? You know that's my black Camaro over there. Bro, don't tell me you shot my car. - Yeah I did. - Oh my god. You know Kayla's gonna love that. Oh-oh. Shit man, you got 12 out here? Yo, I'm gonna holla at you later, I gotta bounce. Whatever dude. You all right baby? Wilkins, what the hell are you doing here? I don't even know how you deal with his ass. I was with Raoul for six month, okay? And got a ring. Cubic zirconia, uh-huh. Is your name even on the deed? Nah, Jah put everything in his name. Bitch, you got the game ass backwards. You have a baby by him, you should of got the house in your name, okay? So when it's time for you to leave his ass you got the child support and you got the crib. Hello, hit his ass where it hurts. Oh, like you did with Justin? After havin' his kid, while messing with Raoul on the side to get your ring. Kay, and? You gotta play the game hunni, 'cause if not, these dudes is gonna play you, 'kay? Now, if Justin wasn't pullin' the same shit that Jah was pullin', I would of never had to hit him like that. Nah, I can't do my Jah like that. I mean, he's wild and he gets on my nerves sometimes, but I know he's a good man with good intentions. Okay, whatever. See, there goes my man right there. What's up babe? What's going on with the car? We were shooting bad guys. Shooting bad guys, Elijah, what is she talkin' about? You had my daughter in the middle of a gun fight? Are you stupid or are you just dumb? Oh baby, I'm sorry. Jasmine, are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine, but it was scary though. It's okay, you're home safe now. Go to your room. Get your baby girl. Yo, hold up, what is she doing here? First of all, talkin' 'bout your stupid ass, you need to stop doing my home girl wrong, and if I find out you put your hands on her Ima cut your ass. Man, you ain't gonna cut nobody, what you need to do is get your basic ass - and get up outta my house. - Basic? Who are you calling basic? - Shut up. - if you were my boyfriend - I would beat your ass. - Shut up. Nobody wants you. I don't even know what to say to you. What is wrong with you? - Baby, come on. - You've gone too far. Baby, baby look. - I'm sorry baby. - I'm sorry. That's all you say is I'm sorry. What were you gonna tell me if you'd brought our daughter home in a body bag? I'm leaving. Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. You can't leave me. Are you baby? Know what, no, you're leavin', get your shit and get out. What, whoa babe, babe, babe, come on, you gotta talk about this with me, come on. I don't wanna talk any more. You need some kind of intervention or god I don't know. You're not gonna be satisfied until we're broke or dead. - What, baby. - Did you get your job back? Yeah, kind of. What do you mean, kinda? I'm working with the FBI now. Nigga, I'm not stupid, you don't just get in like that. Baby, come on, look, just feel me out, okay? You know. No, I can't do this anymore. But babe, we got a baby on the way... Don't touch me. Kayla? Leave Elijah. Kayla. Go. Girl, you handled yourself like a queen. I'm gonna go ahead and get outta here and bitch, call me if you need me, okay? Take that, bye Boo. What you doing Jas? Just playing with my toys, you wanna play with me? Actually, Daddy has to leave. Where you're going? I don't know, I might go stay with Uncle Max for a little while. Did you make Mommy mad again? I guess I did, huh. But I don't want you to leave. I don't wanna leave either, but I love you too much to stay right now. And I know you don't understand, but I'll be back to check up on you, I promise. Okay? All right, give Daddy a big hug so I can get outta here. Be good to your Mom. Mother fucker. You know, I appreciate you allowing me to use your couch tonight. Kayla was still trippin'. See I told your black ass my cousin don't play. See that's what happens when you don't listen to your boy. Anyway, I'm gonna catch up with you later man, I'm gonna hit up this car meet in Long Beach. Oh, and by the way, here's some lotion if you feel the urge. Man, if you don't get this thing outta here, I'm still with my lady, aight. Not tonight. Hello. What do you have? I heard about the incident today. I got nothing. Well I do. This man is a wanted serial killer. The old Jeffrey Dahmer type, except he's ex-military personnel. He was dishonorably discharged almost 20 years ago now. Somehow he was released on good behavior. Oh, serial killer ay. That must explain those head shots at his apartment. You got that right. There's no telling what this man's capable of. In his mind, he's right. Well, as of right now, we don't know where he is or where his whereabouts are, so I guess we have to keep our eyes and ears open. Yeah, because in this town he may very well be right under your nose. I doubt it. Hello? Morning, you miss me? Look Elijah, I don't have time for this, okay? I can't do this right now. Why you just can't say you miss me? Because you need to be taught a lesson. And what lesson is that? That you need to be more responsible and put your family first. What do you think I'm out here tryna do? I'm tryna give my family the good life. We already have a good life. No ones complaining. It's you that wants a good life for yourself and no one else around you is good enough. Everyone's always running around, like once I get this, once I get that, then I'll be happy. No. Open your eyes Elijah. Be happy with right now. You know what, Kay? You're absolutely right. So what I'm gonna do, is I'm gonna come home and Ima get my job back, I'll be a changed me, when you see me I'm gonna be your Elijah, and you're gonna like it. I'm doing it for you and Jas, 'cause I love y'all both that much. I love you too. Now come home Daddy. You ain't gotta tell me twice. And can you bring some juice and eggs on your way? Is that all you want? Oh my god, boy stop. Aight, I got you. Bye. Yo Max, I appreciate you letting me stay at the crib tonight man. I'll get you you're mug back too. Man, fuck you. It's gonna be a long day. What's going on in the world today? Yo, yo, yo, you're tuning in to 92.3 the K wave, and today is gonna be a game between the Dodger's and the San Francisco Giants. Hope you guys got your tickets 'cause they're all ready sold out. - Oh my god. - Man, what you all think about this new news now between Cardi B. She got into another altercation with another artist. Agent Mendez, look I need you to get everybody on high alert at the Dodger Stadium right now. Shoot, there he goes right there. Not this again. I'm gonna finish this guy for good. It's over Conner, surrender now. Ah, I'll never surrender Detective. Look, I don't have time for this today. I've got backup on the way so drop your weapon now. Why don't you come out here and face me like a man. Let's go. Lay down on the ground and drop your weapon. Aww, you didn't really think I'd turn myself over that easy, did you Detective? Well that's a detonator. There's enough C4 to take down this entire structure so I recommend, drop your weapon, get the hell outta my way. Why you doing this? Why am I doing this? Well it's quite simple. Revenge. Justice. Pleasure. You ever have the rush of taking a life Detective? The screams, the lovely downpour of blood, the great taste of human flesh. You kill one, and two, and thirst for more just builds. The stadium will be my greatest victory of all time. No, whatever you been through is not the fault of innocent lives. But it sure will get the attention of those who misunderstood and outcast me. Do you know what it's like to be ignored Detective? No, I don't. I didn't think so. When this is over, I'll be famous, in the minds and mouths of many. Everyone will know my name. No, you'll infamous, and that's how you wanna go down? As a killer? Any prize is good prize. You're sick Conner, and you need some help, let me help you. You are starting to sound like my former comrade. You should of heard the way that he begged me for mercy as I split his testicles. All right, that's enough. Get down on the ground now. No, you drop your weapon Detective. Drop it. Attaboy. So I guess you're ready to die, huh? We'll see. Ready to fuckin' die? You're going down. Ah, ah, ah, ah. Delicious. It's over Conner, you're under arrest. Even if you did put an end to this job there would still be an explosive after party. You got another bomb? Bingo. There is only one other local division I despise. When was the last time you took out your trash Detective? You devil. No, but I do work for him. Don't do this. - Good bye. - No. Max, how'd you find me? You know I still got those police scanners? Heard your name and the nearest location. What I'm tryna figure out is how I got here before they did. Damn, they're still slow to save black people if you're one of them. Man, shut up. I think there's another bomb. What, where? I don't know man. Last thing he said was something about a trash can. You think he can put the bomb inside your house? Oh god, please don't say that Max, don't say that Max. Oh my god, I can't live with that. Look, we gotta go, we gotta go now, come on. Oh shoot. Dog, we gotta go back man, I forgot the C4, man, I don't know where he place it at man... Chill, chill, I took care of it all ready, man, I grabbed the bomb in his car, it was down the street from where you guys where at. Where is it? Oh, it's in the trunk. You got the C4 in the trunk? Yes nigga, in the trunk. Oh my god. You know what, I can't even think about this right now, I need to call Kayla, come one, let me see your phone. Why nigga, where's your phone? I don't know, I think I dropped it chasing these goons or something man, just let me see the phone. What do you want? Hey Kayla, what's up baby, look, look, look, I know you're mad, but look, you gotta do what I tell you, okay? Look, I don't have time for games right now Elijah, I'm about to hang up this phone. No, no, no, no, whatever you do, do not hang up. I'm tired of your lies, what do you want? Where's Jasmine? Okay look, I know this is gonna sound crazy, but you gotta get Jasmine, and get up out the house. Why, Elijah? Baby, there's a bomb in the trash can. Okay, now you've really lost it, you need to be checked out. I know, look, I know it sounds crazy baby, look, but you think I would make up somethin' like this? Listen to the sound of my voice, okay? I need you to go get our baby girl and get up out the house, please? My ball. Jasmine, get away from that trash can. Is everything okay? Yeah, everything's fine. Okay, I'm sorry baby, love you, I'll be home shortly, okay? I love you. What's up man, everything cool? Yeah, everything's cool man. Nothin' happened. So where is this second bomb? I don't know man, think that fool was lyin'. Yeah, let me take you to your car. Nah, nah, nah, don't take me to the home man, just take me by the precinct, man, I gotta go back and get my job. Good call. Lieutenant. I've been lookin' for you. What's up Elijah? I wanna apologize, you know, maybe you were right. Maybe I'm not FBI material. Maybe I'm nowhere near ready. Maybe I'm just wild and reckless. I hear it from you and I hear it from the ones I love. Glad you finally had your awakening. I got the call about you taking out that terrorist too that you've been so adamant about, congratulations. Yeah, I took a hit, but I took him out too. So, you think they gonna let you in now? I don't even know, honestly, I don't even know if I wanna be an FBI agent no more. So you know, I was hoping, maybe you could give me my job back. You're reckless, disastrous, a danger to innocent civilians, actually, you destroy everything you touch. I mean, I wouldn't say all that. But it's true though. So, no. Elijah, I can't give you your job back. However, why don't you take some time off man? Really self evaluate, spend some time with your family. I'll grant you pay leave. Guess that's better than nothing, right? Yeah, so be thankful. Now go home. Think I'll do that. No worries. Thanks Lieutenant. No problem. Oh, you do me one favor, one favor, could you please take my trash to the garbage? I don't know what's wrong with our janitor. Did you just say trash? Yeah. There is only one other local division I despise, when was the last time you took out your trash Detective? Where the main trash at? Shit. Oh Elijah, why you dragging me out here in the heat, my leg hurt, I think I twisted my ankle, I ain't walking all day, it's hot. Oh my god, is that what I think it is? Damn right it is what you think it is. Oh, come on. Okay, all right, you gotta get the hell outta here, you're not even suppose to be here. What are you gonna do, call the bomb unit? You do realize there's only five minutes on this thing, right? Shit. All right, Elijah, you gotta leave, you're not suppose to be here. - Get the hell outta here. - No, no, no, I'm staying man. Yeah, I'll take care of this. No, no, no, Lieutenant, look, you're trippin', look, maybe we could just put this bomb inside this thing, right, it's metal, I'm sure we could fuse it down - or something like that. - Elijah, no. It won't diffuse it. Now there's hundreds of people on the inside, this thing blows, everybody will be dead, okay? - All right, look, just... - What are you doing? Okay, I'm gonna cut the - case open. - You're gonna do what? Remember, I used to do this for a living, - now just... - Bro, that was over 10 years ago. I know how long it was, all right? Just get the hell out of here, all right, don't make me cut you, all right, come on. This dude is about to cut a bomb. - Just the casing. - Oh my gosh, oh god, I'm sorry, whatever I did please forgive me 'cause I'm about to die, I'm about to come see you sooner than I thought. Hey, hey, can I focus please? Thank you, this is a bomb, okay? You sure you know what you're doing? I can focus if you shut the hell up, all right? I have a woman and a girl - and your about to cut a bomb. - Shut up, I know you have kids. Oh my god. I have to focus. Ah, okay, I'll pass you here, I think I found it, I think I found it. Just, all right man, if I die, I'm gonna kill you, - okay? - You're right, I get it, I get it. Okay. Do it. Oh shit. Oh shit. Don't scare me like that again. Oh my god dude, oh my god, you did it. I guess, I guess I still got. You damn right you still got it man. I'm glad you found it otherwise we'd all been dead man, you saved a lot of lives today. Look man, I gotta go man, I got a wifey waitin' on me. Look, I thank you for the vacation and everything like that man, all right? Look, you got it man, look, just don't bring your ass back here till I call you. I'm out. Yeah, be out. Sims, do me a favor and call the unit. Yeah, the bomb unit, just send them to the back of the building. Don't question, just send me the damn unit. Yeah and Sims, bring me some cigarettes. You missed breakfast. Yeah, I know I did. How's Jas, what's she up to? She's in her room, asleep. Look, baby, I know you don't wanna hear this, but I'm sorry, I'm sorry 'bout everything. I been doing a whole lot of thinking and I think I'm gonna let this whole FBI thing alone. No dream is worth me loosing my family. Stop. I'm not gonna let you do that. I know how hard you worked for this. Max and your lieutenant called me to explain everything. Lieutenant? Yeah, you either got an angel on your side or your lyin'. Come on, you know I got some angels on my side. I know, but I forgive you.. I missed you so much. It's only been a day. I know, but I can't live without you. Ah, baby, my arm. I'm sorry, big baby.

Yeah, come on, pack up, we're going to Jamaica. Okay, I'm down with that. - Aiight. - Yeah. Then I'll go get our passports outta the closet then. All right baby. Hello. Wilkins. Agent Mendez. Nice work out there, but not exactly the way we handle things around here. Okay, so what are you saying? I'm saying you're in. Come on, stop playing. I pulled some strings and got you in. You're officially with the FBI. And just in time for the next training session at Quantico next week, can you make it? You know, actually I'm gonna decline that next training session. But the next one's not for another month or so. Yeah I know, but, I got something worth the wait right now. All right, well you give me a call real soon.

Hey, you remember that girl from back in the day, Veronica? Wait, wait, Veronica? - Yes. - What about her? You know she had a crush on you right? Oh my gosh, stop playing. Okay, I never told you this, but one night I was at your house and there was a knock on the door. You were in the bathroom so I went and answered it. When I opened the door, it's Veronica standing in the middle of the rain with a box of cookies I'm assuming were for you. Okay, so what'd you do? I snatched those cookies from her, told her you weren't home, and slammed the door in her face. What do you think? Hold on, wait a minute, 'cause I know you. What? Did you eat them cookies though? I had a few. - Oh my goodness. - A few. Look, she wasn't about to have my man, okay? Aren't you a little territorial? - Yeah. - Excuse me ma'am, welcome to Treys, can I offer you some wine?
