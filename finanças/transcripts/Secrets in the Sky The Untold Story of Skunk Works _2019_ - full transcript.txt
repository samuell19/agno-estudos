Justice: The Skunk Works created airplanes that changed world history. Jacobsen: These guys are really at the nexus of mystery, intrigue. Secrets are built in into the American military. ♪♪ ♪♪ Narrator: For years, I had to live in the shadows. See, that's what we did back then. I led a top-secret organization called the Skunk Works. Funny name, I know. I'll get to that later. My men made the airplanes that kept America safe. I'm Kelly Johnson, and for years, I was more than happy that very few knew my name. He's a figure in American military history that more people should know, but the CIA and the United States government did not want the public to know his name. People weren't supposed to know about Kelly Johnson. Narrator: As head of Skunk Works, I wrote near daily in a logbook, making a record of my thoughts, plans, and ideas. It was my personal journal, hidden from the public until now. Westwick: These mythical logbooks, I've seen pages out of them. They're kind of the holy grail of aerospace historians because here is a detailed log of one of the iconic aircraft designers of the 20th century. But I've never seen a full round of them because I think a lot of them are still classified. Narrator: The Skunk Works is a concentration of a few good people solving problems far in advance and at a fraction of the cost of other groups in the aircraft industry. Almost all of what we did was classified. We designed our first spy plane during a very different time in American history, when America was in the Cold War. The origins of the Cold War manifested in the late 1940s, early 1950s. The first big blowup was in 1949. The Soviets explode their first atomic bomb. ♪♪ All of a sudden, America and the Soviets have this nuclear capability. This arms race ensues. They were boasting and bragging that they had missiles being pumped out like sausages. They had bombers. Painter: And everybody is scared that, "Oh, my God, they've got so many bombers. They're going to fly over the North Pole, and they're going to bomb the United States into, you know, Never Never Land." Lockheed Jr. And it was simply a fact of life. There was a possibility that the threats and the desire expressed for world domination by the Soviet Union could turn into a nuclear conflict. It was implicit in all of the air drills that we did as children in grade school. The American government was desperate to find out how strong the Soviets were, and it was very difficult to get information out of the Soviet Union. They were a closed society. The CIA could not get any human spies on the ground in the Soviet Union. I mean, it was called the Iron Curtain for a real reason, you know? It was impenetrable. Cappuccio: What Eisenhower was impressed with was data. "I need to see what they're doing. I have to see that data. I have to..." And it has to be of a quality that says, "That is a tank and not a 2-ton truck. That is a missile and not a pipe." And the President authorized these incredibly nerdy engineers to create this spy plane that can fly high enough to be out of the line of fire of Soviet surface-to-air missiles. Narrator: The year was 1955. Previously, Skunk Works had designed two successful jet fighters for the government, the Shooting Star and the Starfighter. Planes could soar to 50,000 feet. We needed an airplane that could go 70,000 feet, out of range of them Russian missiles. And from that height, we needed to capture images as tiny as my typewriter. That was the first reconnaissance aircraft built from the ground up, capturing secrets in the sky. We called it the U-2. Powers Jr. Up until the U-2, there was no reconnaissance aircraft. It was a modified bomber with a camera. The U-2 was the first plane to be specifically designed to fly over foreign countries to take pictures to gather intelligence for review here by the United States. With the U-2, you wanted high altitude. That was going to be the way you survived. Well, if you want high altitude, then you got to have light weight, so you do severe things. Like, on the U-2, you have one main landing gear in the middle of the fuselage on the bottom. You don't have two or more landing gears. Jacobsen: This was a plane that had to be so incredibly light to get up to 70,000 feet. I mean, the skin on the aircraft was something like 0.02 inches. Painter: In the camera system, they actually had two 9-inch reels of film, and they counter-rotated so that the weight between the two reels was always the same. It was that critical on that aircraft to keep the weight in balance. Narrator: Everything we did had to be secretive, even within our own parent company, Lockheed. During the 1950s, it was one of the top airplane manufacturers in the world. Skunk Works was a subdivision, yet very few within the company knew what we were doing. Mullin: Skunk Works was physically in Burbank, and it was hidden within the Lockheed California company. I had been with Lockheed well over 20 years, and I knew very little about the Skunk Works. Justice: The Skunk Works itself was a secret for a long time. When I hired in, I was not allowed to tell people I worked for the Skunk Works. Law: When I first went to Lockheed, I didn't know a thing about it, and everybody that was there says, "If you're a good engineer, maybe you'll get to go over to the Skunk Works some day." As it turned out, when I did go over to the Skunk Works, it was a different world. Number one, you would not talk about your work to anybody, including your wife. They could fire you if you told somebody you worked for the Skunk Works. Cappuccio: The second thing is, you had to be investigated to make sure you were an honest, loyal, trustworthy citizen. The fact that there was an organized approach by the Soviets to have spies here was a fact of life. There were, undoubtedly, hostile agents that were trying to steal the intellectual property, as we would say today, or understand what it is that was being developed. Simple things like, "Watch the guy on the Xerox machine. Make sure he only replaces the cartridge, not put a camera in it." Law: Russians and Chinese had ships out in the water, and they could tap your phone calls, and, you know, everything was just getting to the point where you couldn't trust anybody, so they started giving lie-detector tests. "Has anybody contacted you on this? Has anybody asked you this?" Another thing everyone was afraid of was a honeypot, and the honeypot is literally like a female paramour, a Russian spy who would try to seduce a male worker at the Skunk Works and try and then, in pillow talk, get this information from them. The environment that created the U-2, they wanted to truly protect the fact that the airplane was even in development. Kelly had money delivered to his house, the payments for the contract. They set up front companies to buy equipment, anything they could do to mask the fact that an airplane was in development. Narrator: We needed a place to build the U-2, somewhere completely off the grid, not the kind of place you could find on a map. Jacobsen: They have to find a base that is so secret that no one will know what they're doing, so Kelly Johnson and the CIA's Richard Bissell start flying over the American west, and where do they wind up? Inside the middle of the Nevada Test Site where the Atomic Energy Commission just so happens to be setting off nuclear bombs. I mean, I'm talking mushroom cloud and all outside of Las Vegas, Nevada. It's impossible to imagine now, but this was going on in the 1950s, and they think to themselves, "No one is going to follow us here." So, they partition off a segment of the Nevada Test Site specifically for this aircraft, and the reason it's chosen in particular is because it's an old, dry lake bed, and it's extraordinarily flat, and that's what they need for a sort of natural runway. And it's called Groom Lake, and now we know Groom Lake to be Area 51. ♪♪ ♪♪ Petraeus: Well, Area 51, of course, in the 1950s, this is so isolated. A lot of activity could be conducted there without folks seeing it. Narrator: Base location has been decided as Site II, for which the government will accept my proposed name of "Paradise Ranch." Justice: The Paradise Ranch name was given to it to try to make it sound better. There is just nothing there, and in the days of the U-2, it's a few trailers that are set up, so you can imagine there wasn't really a lot of air-conditioning or anything. This is rough working conditions. Jacobsen: One of the lead physicists out there told me one of his most acute memories was looking across the way and being like, "What is that?" and realizing that it was a coyote chasing a rabbit, but they were both walking. Painter: One of the little not-so-good features was Yucca Flats was still detonating nuclear weapons, so every once in a while, everybody had to get out of town, and they'd have to wait two or three weeks, and they'd go back in with the Geiger counters and make sure it was safe, and they'd go back to work. Jacobsen: You can imagine how glamorous it must seem, but if you go back in time to 1955, the reality of the situation was that it was a bunch of engineers, test pilots, and CIA officers. It was an extremely tiny project in terms of need to know. There was the President, and there was only 200 people working out at Area 51 to get this U-2 aloft. And then, back in the old days, we flew up there from Burbank, and the first time you went up to the test site, you had to sit in a part of the airplane with the windows blocked so that you couldn't see where you were going, but once you got up there and filled out your paperwork to get the badge that you had to have when you were on the site, then you could sit in any part of the airplane where there was a window. It was fun. I hate to say this, but we got to fly over the craters that were in the ground up in north of Las Vegas where they were doing all the atomic tests. You could see these big cavities and things. The U-2 was pushing the boundaries of what we knew how to do, but this was absolutely critical. This was at a time where -- And we knew the Soviets were working on these nuclear weapons. There was even reports that they had a nuclear-powered bomber, but we didn't have any way to verify. We didn't have satellites then. Narrator: We worked night and day perfecting the U-2 at Area 51. Sleep -- that was just something we all dreamt about. Airplane essentially completed. Terrifically long hours. Everybody almost dead. ♪♪ ♪♪ We did everything we could to keep the U-2 top-secret, but there were times civilians spotted the plane soaring in the sky. Luckily, the reports coming in were sightings of unidentified flying objects. Man: I'm getting some reports from the tower, radio tower, and several radar sites about the UFO. During the testing of the U-2, people saw these "UFOs," and 50% of all sightings in the '50s and '60s were because of Skunk Works aircraft. The CIA had a whole bureau to deal with U-2/UFO sightings because it was such a common thing to have happen whereby someone would see something up in the sky that was completely inexplicable. I mean, the U-2 -- the wings are so long in it, it almost looks like a flying cross, and people just couldn't comprehend what could fly up that high. Justice: You know, imagine that you're a commercial airliner pilot and you're up at about 38,000 or 40,000 feet. You're pretty high. You know that military jets go to about 50,000 feet. And then you see something way above you. It is way above 50,000 feet. So now you see this very light-colored thing at twice your altitude. What conclusion are you going to draw? After one year's investigation, I believe that the flying saucers seen by veteran airline and Air Force pilots are objects from another planet. Narrator: At Area 51, we did have creatures that seemed more than human, but they weren't space men. They were our test pilots. These men were a different breed of beings, and testing our machines was a test of their own mettle. If you go back and you say, when these airplanes were designed and you look at the tool sets to design them, most of them were done with simple slide rules, so there was a fair amount of uncertainty. Justice: And we're talking, you know, the mid-1950s here. You know, I mean, the technology was still very crude. Flying at that altitude, you're above most of the atmosphere. The air is extremely thin, and getting a jet engine to run up there is very difficult. Keeping the pilot alive is very difficult. Trimble: The aircraft is flying at 70,000 feet. Once you get above 63,000, 64,000 feet, if your body was exposed to the air pressure at that altitude, the blood inside your body would begin to boil. The human body is not designed to be exposed to air pressure that low, so you have to wear a pressurized space suit just to survive. Jacobsen: It took three flight surgeons to help you into the suit to make sure there were no rips, that the zipper went up the right way, and then you sat and you re-breathed pure oxygen for two hours. Man: High flights without free breathing would result in nitrogen bubbles forming in the blood, the painful and often fatal bends encountered by deep-sea divers. Jacobsen: What these pilots had to go through before they even got into the plane, it's just extraordinary to think about. That's American history. Petraeus: They're right on the edge of what their physical capacity is and, of course, what their aircraft's capacity is. This is a very rare breed and a very special group of Americans. Painter: You're essentially flying in what some pilots refer to as coffin's corner. You have about 10 knots of air speed from stall to going Mach 1, so at either end, the plane is non-flyable. Doing a high rate of bank turn at that altitude, you can't do that, either, because the wingspan is so long. The inside wing is stalling, and the outside wing is going Mach. So the pilots who flew these airplanes had to be extremely gifted pilots. Powers Jr.: You had to have the aptitude to fly this type of a mission and to keep quiet about it. Pilots were breaking the high-altitude record every day, yet they couldn't tell anybody about it. Gilliland Jr.: Why does a guy like that get into a plane that's never been flown before, with the possibility of death? Not everybody goes to work each day with a high possibility of being killed at the end of the day. Morgenfeld: I think most of us aren't quite that emotional about it. Crashes can be useful in sort of a perverse way, in that, "Hey, we just found out something that's wrong." Oh, boy, there have been so many of the guys that I know that have died. Hell, I just can't even... It's hard to talk about those people that have died. We did the best we could, and something that we couldn't possibly take into account happened. And the reason we concentrate on it so much is because these people's lives and their family's lives are on the line in our hands. Kelly was beyond devastated. He would cry. I mean, these guys are your friends. Narrator: Whenever one of our planes went down, I'd get a bad stomach ulcer. If you go into Kelly's logs, you can tell that he took his responsibility very, very hard. He suffered from stress. Just a few months before they delivered the U-2, he had a complete physical breakdown that almost killed him. Narrator: I just want to help the U.S., my people, and others. The sacrifices of these test pilots can't be in vain. And they weren't. Within the first year of operation, it dispelled the missile gap and the bomber gap. Because of the U-2 flights and the photographic reconnaissance imagery they brought home, America was able to prove and show internally that the Soviets were boasting about the missiles they had. They were not as far advanced as we thought they were or as they were bragging about. Narrator: We thought the Red's radar couldn't detect us, but we were wrong. Justice: The very first overflight of the Soviet Union was tracked on its full length, and that surprised the CIA and it surprised the American government. That was a bad thing. It meant that the Soviet radars were way better than we thought they were. Brown: They could pick the U-2 up, and they couldn't reach it, and it became obvious almost as soon as the U-2 was designed that it was going to become obsolete as soon as the Soviets had adequate surface-to-air weapons. In 1955, the Soviets only had one type of a missile, SA1, Surface-to-Air Missile 1. It could reach an altitude of 60,000 feet, but U-2s were flying at 70,000 feet, so for four years, they were out of harm's way. May 1st of 1960, my father is briefed that, upon this mission, there are certain targets he should overfly, that they're trying to get information. One of the targets, over Sverdlovsk, was to film an SA2 base, a new, improved missile base that a previous mission had uncovered. The goal of this particular flight May 1st was to find out if the Soviets were getting ready to put operational the missile base they had discovered. And my father found out firsthand that it was operational. Reporter: A United States Air Force plane shot down on Russian soil, reportedly an ultra-secret high-altitude reconnaissance craft. As the Soviet launches its most belligerent anti-American propaganda barrage in recent years. Jacobsen: And it all went back to these engineers, you know, with the pencils in their pocket. The Skunk Works are really at the nexus of history. At issue was nuclear war. ♪♪ [ Rumbling ] ♪♪ Narrator: We lost airplane flown by Francis G. Powers. There was an immediate Russian reaction, and they claimed they shot down the airplane by missile. The political implications of the flight were extremely major. Justice: The aftermath of Powers being shot down was really interesting because he didn't report in or land when he was supposed to, so now you have the U.S. decision-makers wondering what happened. They picked up some of the radio reports that maybe something had happened to him, but they didn't have confirmation, so now you had this silence as each other waited to see what the other one was going to do. The Soviets were playing a game. They were trying to trap the Americans, so they intentionally released this fake photo to see what the Americans would do. This photograph showed a pile of wreckage, plane wreckage, in a field with kids and farmers around it. Kelly Johnson takes one look at this photo and says, "The rivets are not lined up correctly for a U-2," and that, "The fuel intake and the jet intake isn't correct. That's not my plane." Narrator: So I was given the job of insulting them to the point where they would show us what they had, because we did not know whether Powers had just defected. Painter: So, Kelly was brought in and made some public comments about what was being shown on TV, saying, "That's no U-2. Soviets are lying." Powers Jr.: As a result, all of a sudden, maybe they didn't shoot it down. Maybe there's no plane wreckage. Maybe the pilot died. They have no evidence. Release the cover stories. Justice: Then the U.S. announced, "Well, we lost tck of a weather plane. It may have wandered into Soviet airspace." And the Soviets go, "Got you." Powers Jr.: Premier Khrushchev comes up and says, "Ah, we do have the pilot. Here he is. Ah, we do have the wreckage. Here it is." The trial, guy gets stuck in a Russian prison, sentenced to 10 years imprisonment. The first three months of his captivity was solitary confinement. And then he was interrogated -- bright lights, long days of questioning, Mutt-and-Jeff type of scenario. One KGB guy would come in, rough and gruff, yelling and screaming, "You tell us everything, or we'll shoot you tomorrow." The next guy would come in, "Mr. Powers, you help us, we can help you." Trying to get information out of him by any means necessary, short of physical abuse. He would reveal certain things that he knew they could find out in the press. He'd keep other things secret that he knew that they could have no ways of finding out. Gilliland Jr.: Francis Gary Powers was held for quite a while, and then eventually, you know, there was the story with the "Bridge of Spies," you know, the movie that was done. Powers Jr.: February 10, 1962, you have two spies on each side of this bridge -- Rudolf Abel on the west side, my father on the east side. They are positively ID'd. They walk home to their respective freedoms. My father returns home to an American public that doesn't really know what to make of this ordeal. There have been misinformation and rumors in the papers that he had defected, that he had landed the plane intact, that he had spilled his guts and told the Soviets everything he knew or that he hadn't followed orders and committed suicide. Dad is not able to go back into the Air Force at the time. He's the known spy. If they employ him, they will be accused of employing spies. In the meantime, Kelly Johnson offered my dad a job as a Lockheed test pilot, flying U-2s. Justice: One of the attributes of Kelly, while he was a tough guy, he had a soft spot, and he always wanted to take care of his pilots, and when Francis Gary Powers came back, Kelly couldn't stand to see that guy on the street. This was a national hero, even though he wasn't being treated like one, so, yeah, Kelly gave him a job. Narrator: I felt for Powers. He and I were both now known to the public. After the U-2 incident, everything changed. It was suggested to me by security people that I not go to work by the same route. I've been told to avoid certain traffic intersections and watch out for big trucks. I slept with an automatic pistol close by. There were concerns, and the CIA told him that he needed to take precautions, because somebody like him was somebody who an adversary might want to kidnap or do something about to prevent him from embarrassing them with new technology again. It does sound paranoid, but it wasn't crazy. The idea behind it is that they would, like, get them and torture them and say, "Tell us how you built the U-2," but that was a very real threat because, as far as we know, the Soviets never got a spy plane over the United States. Narrator: The U-2 is still busy, now over Cuba. This aircraft took the pictures that were the basis for our move on Cuba. The images showed Soviet missiles just 90 miles from U.S. soil. That was the aircraft that discovered the missile sites on Cuba that weren't supposed to be there. That's when the Cuban Missile Crisis started. I have directed the continued and increased close surveillance of Cuba and its military buildup. Narrator: A U-2 was shot down over Cuba. They had 11 radar and missile sites turned on against him and repeated their success with Powers, except, this time, Major Rudolf Anderson was killed. It is apparent that the U-bird has just about reached the end of its reconnaissance capability. We knew we needed a new kind of airplane, one that was near impossible to shoot down, a plane unlike anything man had ever seen before, something so fast the human eye could barely see it in the sky. ♪♪ ♪♪ yearsbefore the U-2 was shot down, that we ought to be working on something that would go higher, go faster, go further. We'd be starting from scratch, just like the Wright brothers. Powers Jr.: Kelly Johnson and the Skunk Works team realized they had to develop some type of an airplane that could fly higher and faster than the U-2 in order to avoid Soviet missiles. We have to design something better. Jacobsen: It was impossible to think about, but Kelly Johnson said, "We did it with the U-2. We can do it." Carpenter: We needed an airplane that flies not at 70,000 feet but at 85,000 feet and above. Instead of an airplane that flies at 450 miles an hour, we needed an airplane that flies at 2,100 miles an hour -- Mach 3-plus. Mach is a designation for capturing the speed of airplane relative to the speed of sound. Mach 1 is the speed of sound. Mach 3 means that you're covering 1 mile every second and a half. Mach 3.2, the airplane goes faster than a .30-06 bullet. You cannot turn the airplane in the state of Ohio it goes so fast. What made it so special and so difficult was that there were so many things in it that had never been done before. You know, for example, that's the first time we ever built anything large out of titanium. The decision to use titanium is traceable to the environment in which it flew. When you're traveling 2,000 miles per hour, the friction of the air rubbing over the airplane heats up the airframe to about 550 degrees Fahrenheit, which is about as hot as your oven can get at home. You could almost immediately rule out aluminum, because aluminum above about 370 degrees loses its strength. So he was driven to titanium because it's strong as steel and half the weight of steel, but we really hadn't used much of titanium. Narrator: To get the titanium, we went to an unlikely source -- our enemy. Carpenter: We don't have a titanium source in the United States, so the CIA eventually set up a frontal company in Europe, and the Russians sold us all the titanium. They never knew who they sold it to. So you had the CIA buying the materials that they needed for this aircraft so it could fly over the Soviet Union and spy on them. It was an incredibly ambitious aircraft to design. The other issue is that jet engines are really, really good, even up to Mach 2, Mach 2.5, but once they go beyond that speed, it gets very tricky. Westwick: For a Mach-3 flight, you have funnel just an amazing quantity of air through these jet engines. The quantity of air is like as much water as flows over Niagara Falls. That's the volume of air that you're funneling through. The problem is, when you're funneling that volume of air in, you get these shock waves in the air that prevent the air from actually reaching the jet engines, so the engine stalls, and the airplane crashes. Narrator: We needed a special engineer to solve the air-flow problem on our new plane. His name -- Ben Rich. Westwick: Ben Rich helped solve that problem by designing this cone in the middle of the jet engine that moves in and out depending on how fast you're flying, and that allows the aircraft to control shock waves, one of Ben Rich's early signature achievements. You're not talking about a computer that, you know, you can just put a couple lines of code in to operate the intake. You know, you're talking mechanical hydraulic systems that was very difficult to operate, and it was Ben's job to fix it, and he did. And he solved that problem without computer and without digital, all analog, which is a -- And that made him famous. Gilliland Jr.: I remember walking around, and I'd see these big 500-gallon drums, and they'd catch the leaking fuel. The airplane actually expands mid-flight because of the heat soak. They couldn't get a sealant that would really work tight, so what happens is, the plane leaks on the ground, a lot of fuel, but once it gets up to speed at altitude, the airplane tightens up, and it's tight as a drum. Middle of July in 1961, the airplane was being assembled, and from that time, not a very long period of time from July to the next February, a whole airplane was built. Took them on a truck, took them up to the test site. Narrator: At the time, the Soviets had a new ally, in Cuba. It seemed at any moment, we could be on the brink of nuclear war. We needed to test our new recon plane, and we went back to the place where we had our greatest success -- Area 51. Painter: Out a Groom Lake, Area 51, they worked on doing testing, which essentially turned that from a temporary area into a permanent facility. That's when they realized they needed hard, fast buildings. ♪♪ ♪♪ Narrator: In testing, while flying Mach 3.2, we found we could reduce the internal temperature by painting the plane black, hence the name Blackbird. There was a great deal of risk involved for everyone. We had to make sure the pilots didn't cook in the cockpit. Law: The environment that they were in, the minimum surface temperature around the cockpit was 550 degrees, and some parts of the cockpit windshield were up at 640 degrees Fahrenheit. Cappuccio: The test pilots knew the risk they were taking because of the nuances associated with propulsion ramping. There was always a 5%, 6% chance you'll get a shock wave that goes around the entire vehicle. And we had one, and it snapped the vehicle in hal It literally broke the vehicle in half. We lost the pilot. So Kelly -- he was very nervous in the beginning. "Did I get the calculations right? Did I use the right safety factors?" Petraeus: These are individuals who voluntarily went into that world understanding the risk, just constantly pushing the envelope, knowing the importance of the tasks in which they were engaged. The day of the mission, you came in about 2 1/2 hours before the flight. You had to have a physical before every flight that you had to pass. At that point, they fed you high-protein food to give you the energy through the flight -- steak and eggs. About an hour 15 prior, you donned your space suit. They then took you out to the airplane. ♪♪ They gave you time to taxi out to the runway. ♪♪ Your greatest sense of speed is on takeoff. You release the brakes. You light those two powerful afterburners.

Now, once you got up there, typically around 78,000 feet, you can see the curvature of the Earth. The sky above you is absolutely black, because 97% of the atmosphere is below you. At night, the sky is absolutely spectacular. 90% of the stars you can see up there we can't see on the earth because the atmosphere filters them out. It's very quiet. You're in an airplane that's traveling at three times the speed of sound, so most of the sound is behind you. You see the Earth from a different perspective. ♪♪ Those were 11-hour-and-20-minute missions, some of them, so it's like the long-distance runner. You're not necessarily sprinting, but you've got to keep your energy up, so you watched your diet. I remember once on a mission, the night before, I'd had a seafood dinner. And I had an explosive diarrhea attack, one of those really interesting moments in your life. We had a discussion, and we kind of said, "Well, you know, if you don't change a baby's diapers, what's the worst thing that can happen? Maybe they'll get a rash." So I told my back-seater -- I said, "I think we can press on." I said, "The last thing I want is a message sent to the president, 'The pilot pooped in his suit, so they had to return back.'" I can't remember if I got a rash, but they had to tear out the liner when we got back, and I gave our suit-maintenance people a case of beer for having to reconstitute my suit. [ Chuckles ] Narrator: The Blackbird made my men go beyond their limits -- the men who flew and those who made it possible to fly, our engineers. To me, some of the most remarkable thing of it is that it was all done using logarithms and trig tables and Friden calculators. Jacobsen: It's just so remarkable to think about. You know, they were just looking at physics. They were looking at basic foundations of how science works. They simply used their minds, their imaginations, and their willingness to engineer a system. They didn't have computers. How could you possibly come up with such advanced technology? So a lot of people came to believe that the Skunk Works were actually reverse-engineering some kind of alien technology Kelly Johnson brought to Area 51. ♪♪ e Air Force in December of 1953. He had gone home to his ranch in California, and he looked out and saw something he couldn't quite understand. This was something that was moving at a very high rate of speed away from him, and he drew a little sketch of what the aircraft looked like. Narrator: I have definitely believed in the possibility that flying saucers exist. This is in spite of a good deal of kidding from my technical associates. I am now more firmly convinced than ever. Jacobsen: Because of this extraordinary circumstance, whatever it may have been, a lot of people came to believe that the Skunk Works were actually reverse-engineering some kind of alien technology Kelly Johnson brought to Area 51. ♪♪ Law: There were some people -- they had come up with this idea of all these weird things that had supposedly happened at the test site to do with the Blackbirds. Because how could you possibly come up with such advanced technology? They didn't have computers. Cappuccio: What about the conspiracy theories that the Blackbird was based on alien technology? They like to believe it because they can't envision a class of people that can think out of the box. There was no magic. It didn't come from anything else. It just came from somebody having a dream. If you look at Kelly's design book, it's about 20 pages. I was very, very interested in understanding how he managed to envision something so unique from the technology that existed at the time. I didn't get the magic until there was one chart that had a propulsion curve in it, and he said, "You know, I think I can get 20% higher." And it finally dawned on me -- if you go 20% higher on every part of the design -- It's easier to go from 1.5 Mach number, which we knew how to do, to 3, and that was how genius works. ♪♪ Narrator: All it really is, is the application of common sense to some pretty tough problems. The mental challenge is entertainment for me. It's always been, even back to my first day at Lockheed. He gets the job at Lockheed as a tooling engineer, by the way. He wasn't hired to be an aerodynamicist. He was hired to design the tools to build the airplane. But he goes to the chief engineer, Hall Hibbard, at the time, his first day on the job and says, "Your design for the Model 10 Electra," which was the newest plane that Lockheed is developing, "is unsafe and unstable, and you can't build it that way." This was a passenger aircraft, and you don't want that kind of airplane to be unsafe. It was all he could do to keep from firing the kid on the spot. "Who are you? You know, where'd you come from?" But they bring Kelly in the next day and says, "Okay, why is it not going to fly?" And Kelly is able to answer every one of his questions to the satisfaction that Hall gives this college graduate the model for the aircraft and says, "Fix the airplane." And that's what he did. Westwick: He said, "I think the way to solve it -- instead of having one tail, have two." And they tested it, and, sure enough, the twin-tail solution solved the problem and turned out to be a kind of hallmark of a lot of that generation of planes. Trimble: You don't see too many split-tail designs until 1933, and then you see it with the Model 10, and then, suddenly, everybody has got a split-tail design. It gets copied by almost everybody, but, essentially, he saved the company, you know, with that idea in 1933, because if they had come out with the airplane that they had designed originally, it would have been too unsafe, and airlines just wouldn't buy it. Narrator: I quickly got promoted, eventually becoming chief research engineer. Over the next decade, I worked with the likes of Howard Hughes and Amelia Earhart. It was in 1943 that I set up a secret division within the Lockheed corporation to build the P-80 during World War II. Officially, we were called Advanced Development Research, but the boys came up with "Skunk Works" because we were hidden next to a plastics factory, and the fumes drifting over stunk. Everyone at Skunk Works understood our mission. We had our own set of rules, my rules. If there was a Steve Jobs of the aerospace industry, it was definitely Kelly Johnson. And what Kelly did in his approach was to simplify everything and, above all, keep the momentum going. The way he put it was, "I'd rather make a wrong decision that keeps things moving forward than to stop everything for several weeks to make sure that we're making the right decision." Narrator: Three times, I was offered company president at Lockheed and three times declined it. To me, there was no better job at the corporation than head of Skunk Works. We were about getting things done, but not everyone appreciated our methods. The Skunk Works did have its enemies. People didn't like the way the Skunk Works did things, believed that they cut corners, that they were not living by all the rules and everything. You know, it was, like, on the fly, "Go, go, go. We don't have time for bureaucracy." And this became a problem later in the '60s, when that was threatening to the machine that was the Pentagon, and, surely, someone like Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, who loved to control things like the businessman that he was -- And you could see Robert McNamara making a move to take out Kelly Johnson and the Skunk Works. Narrator: The Blackbird was the fastest jet-powered, manned aircraft ever made, with speed records that were never broken. It was also known as the SR-71. The "SR" stood for strategic reconnaissance. The SR has an unequaled reputation for accomplishing what it was set out for. Carpenter: During the Arab-Israeli War of 1973, 95% of the imagery that our president used to render decisions came from the SR-71. And the photography was spectacular. When you take a normal sheet of paper and you're holding it out in the parking lot and I fly over at 85,000 feet, doing 35 miles a minute, I will take your picture, and I will see you standing beside your car holding this sheet of paper. And most of the time, I could tell you what kind of a car you were driving. But that's the quality of the imagery we brought back for the leadership here in this country. Six presidents used us because they knew they could send us out, and we'd come back. Powers Jr.: I've heard stories from pilots where they'd be flying missions during Vietnam, and they would see the missiles come up, and they would see them fall back down, because the SR was going so fast, the missiles could not keep up with them. Gilliland Jr.: There have been over 5,000 surface-to-air missiles that have been fired at the SR-71 by hostile countries. Not one of them ever hit an SR-71. As Dad used to say, "It helped end the Cold War with Russia, because they spent, you know, a lot of money shooting surface-to-air missiles and never getting a hit, so it helped Russia go bankrupt a little faster." Narrator: With the success of the SR-71, I wanted to build a new version of the Blackbird, more than just a recon plane, something far greater. Once they finished building the SR-71s, if you go into Kelly's logs, you can tell that the one that he wanted to build the most was a fighter-interceptor version. Called the YF-12A, and it was a missile shooter. It was being proposed as an interceptor. Trimble: There was a lot of fear about what would happen if the Soviets decided to attack us with bombers rather than missiles, so the whole idea of that airplane was intercepting an incoming Soviet bomber, and Kelly wanted to sell that to the Air Force, sell hundreds of them, actually. And this became a problem later in the '60s, when, at the Pentagon, now led by Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, who loved to control things, and there's a sense of, "Wait a minute. That boys club out in California called Skunk Works has a little too much power." And you could see him, you know, making a move to take out Kelly Johnson and the Skunk Works. And McNamara shut it down, shut the program down, said it wasn't needed. Narrator: McNamara's decision is almost unbelievable. The Air Force has gone with us all the way supporting the plane, but McNamara and his band see it differently. Cappuccio: Now, what happened was -- Kelly was a very influential player in Washington at the time, with his contacts in the agency that had used SR-71 and his contacts with the Air Force, right? Well, the Air Force pilots liked the SR-71, so he started going around the system. And McNamara was furious. And a decree came back, "You will cut up the SR-71 tools, and you will destroy all the drawings." And that was an edict. You know, to kind of get the point across, they told Lockheed to destroy the tooling, which the U.S. government owned. And when you do that, you make the cost of restarting production astronomically higher, so that was the decision that finally killed the Blackbird. Narrator: The damage has been done, the tools destroyed. We were never able to build the version of the Blackbird our country needed, the YF-12. To this point, I have laid off 130 people in engineering, and it's a sad time for me. This was a really difficult time for the Skunk Works when it happened. It needed money. It had a few thousand employees, and they needed things to do, and the F-12 was supposed to be that thing. Narrator: Yesterday, I took my yearly physical. The doctor says I must have an operation. My stomach has so many ulcers that the outlet is down to the size of a pencil. Constant pain. Trimble: And, at that point, Kelly's health was deteriorating to the point where he had started thinking about whether he should retire. But he also didn't like the idea of retiring, either. That wasn't really sort of in his DNA, so he kept going, but by 1972, 1973, they decided to pass it on, and Ben Rich was the guy. Painter: Ben -- he had an extremely hard job, because Kelly was still a consultant, so he was still coming to Lockheed. He still had that strong loyalty bond with so many of the engineers and people that worked there that instead of going to Ben for answers, they would wait for Kelly to come in on his day of work. So Ben had to overcome all that to establish his leadership, his fingerprint on the Skunk Works. The key job in running the Skunk Works is to work on the future. Ben understood that, and he worked hard at it, and he was very good at it. Once he saw stealth, he took hold of it and pursued it with a vengeance. If I made a plane invisible to radar, would you buy it? Kelly was never impressed. He thought Ben had the wrong idea, that Lockheed was just going to waste money. He pretty much put his reputation and his whole career on the line when he went after that stealth technology. Trimble: After Vietnam, our losses toimble: A, surface-to-air missiles were pretty bad, and it became pretty clear that unless you had some way of defeating these ground-based radars that could cue these surface-to-air missiles that you were going to lose your entire Air Force if you ever got into combat again. So they had to come up with a way to make aircraft less visible to those radars. DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, sent out a request to the seven most recent fighter-building companies for experimental stealth technology, and they had a requirement to get the radar cross-section down to certain levels. Okay. So, think about the radar cross-section on the SR-71, that it shows up on enemy radar the size of a man, okay? We need an airplane that's going to show up the side of a ball bearing. That was the new challenge. "We're going to make an invisible airplane." Cappuccio: How we came across stealth was -- the SR-71 and the angles of the tails were taking the radar section and bouncing the radar beam away. So the radar system was not picking up that reflection. And Ben said, "If I can make a plane with all flat plates, that radar won't pick up the signal." Justice: Ben went to the CIA. The CIA gave him permission to brief the Air Force on the stealth technologies embodied in the Blackbird and say, "Hey, we deserve entry into this," and they said, "Well, we've already given out all the contracts. There's no more money to give out, so if you want to participate, you've got to kind of do it on your own." And so Ben says, "We'll participate. Give us a $1 contract, which means we have a formal relationship with you, but we basically pay our own way." Skunk Works is on its knees at this point in 1975. It's got to have something new. Painter: The company needs to up-front $10 million as their share in building a prototype, so he has to go to the corporate fathers and say, "Give me $10 million, because I got to build an airplane for unproven technology." He pretty much put his reputation and his whole career on the line when he went after that program. ♪♪ Carpenter: Kelly was never impressed. He thought that Ben had the wrong idea, that Lockheed was just going to waste money. To describe the radar cross-section, Ben would roll marbles across the desk. Ben went to Kelly and said, "Look at this. What would a Soviet radar see? Here's a marble, and based upon that, they would not identify that as a significant threat but, rather, a radar anomaly." Justice: And Kelly just thought, "You're not going to be able to make it," and, quite honestly, broke one of his own rules. Kelly would just assume something could be done, and that's what he expected his teams to do, but that's where you see Ben having that piece of DNA of the Skunk Works. You know, let's just assume it can be done. Let's make it happen. Law: Denys Overholser came up with this idea that reflects the beams in all the directions to where they don't make a return, based on a bunch of Russian calculations. ♪♪ Narrator: Just like they once sold us the titanium for the Blackbird, the Russians inadvertently helped Skunk Works again. Trimble: Denys had come across a Soviet mathematics journal. The Soviets had no idea that that's what those equations could be used for, or they would never have allowed it to be published in that kind of a publication. But because they did and Denys read it and applied it, the Skunk Works suddenly had sort of a secret sauce to breaking this problem that had affected aircraft in Vietnam and the U-2 itself, which is radar detection. So, Alan Brown comes in, and he's leading Lockheed's effort under Ben Rich, and he doesn't care about the aerodynamics, because he's a propulsion guy. First of all, we did the calculations. We built third-scale models, which we tested on radar ranges. It was made up of a whole bunch of flat plates, and the reason for that was that we did not have the technical capability to calculate the radar cross-section from curved surfaces at that time. Keep in mind this is why Kelly Johnson hated this approach that Ben Rich took. There aren't any airplanes out there that are made flat, because air doesn't like flying over corners, right? You want nice, smooth, rounded surfaces, and there wasn't a rounded surface anywhere on that airplane. He called it the Hopeless Diamond, and it was a way of sort of ridiculing this design that, to an aerodynamicist, is sinful. I think some people called it the Hopeless Diamond because they thought it was a hopeless effort. The shape of it was -- It was actually a geometry problem pretty much. You wanted a, you know, angle of incidence and angle of reflection. If a radar hit comes in this way, it's going to bounce off, so what you want to do is control the way it bounces off so that the bounce doesn't go back to the guy that shined it on you in the first place. When the radar hits it, right, instead of bouncing right back to you, if I can curve it, I'm bouncing it here. That radar don't pick up the signal. So it's analogous to playing billiards. You hit one cushion, it goes to someplace else. Narrator: The first phase of the competition was to build a scale model to test its invisibility to radar. Ours was easily the best. But next, we had to build the actual plane. Could this Hopeless Diamond really fly? To find out, we needed to test it. We needed to go back to where we had our greatest success and our most guarded secrecy. We needed to go back to Area 51. ♪♪ Narrator: At Area 51, Ben's Hopeless Diamond was going to be tested. We were going to find out if an airplane could really become invisible on radar, if it could be become completely stealth. The stakes were high. If the airplane showed up on radar, the project could be scrapped, but Ben and his team believed they could do it. I still had my doubts. You have to remember that Area 51 has not only the most interesting new, top-secret development that the Air Forces are coming up with, but they also had the top radar people, so we were going to fly against the very best radar team in the country. So we said, "Okay, we'll make it easy for you. Tomorrow afternoon, at 3:00, we're going to come over that hill at 500 feet altitude. You won't even have to look for us. You'll be pointing in the right direction right at the beginning. Okay?" Off we go. ♪♪ 3:00 comes and goes, and they said, "Oh, guess you missed your takeoff time." I said, "I don't think so." There's a guy looking through a telescope, which is run... parallel to the radar. Looking through his telescope, he said, "I just picked the airplane up. It's just 8 miles out." The radar guys immediately kicked their radar, assumed it wasn't working properly. We flew over the whole situation without being seen at all. As soon as that happened, immediately, the Air Force said, "Okay, we got to have a military version of this." Narrator: The damn thing worked. Didn't happen too often, but this time, I was wrong, and I told Ben as much. Trimble: Kelly was always quite stubborn and always quite insistent that he was right, and he would do these bets with people. He would bet them a quarter, and, you know, it was a really big deal if you won a bet against Kelly, because he would pay you the quarter. You know, he would admit that he was wrong, but it would just very rarely ever happen. And so he paid Ben Rich a quarter and admitted that he was wrong. Narrator: Our plane would be called the F-117 Nighthawk. The prototype got off the ground, but much work still remained. This would be the first completely stealth aircraft and also be the first jet fighter Skunk Works built in over 20 years. The 117 has a radar signature less than a BB on a radar. So you get anything over a BB, you'll pick it up. Let me give you an example. If I accthat would bet a nut ipicked up by radar. So, you're sitting there saying, "Wow. We're making all these airplanes. How do I know a manufacturing guy didn't drop a nut?" So that's the concern. Jacobsen: When the F-117 Nighthawk came along, I mean, it was so secret and it was so important to keep it secret, they gave it its own test-flight facility out in Tonopah, which is on the far skirts of the Nevada test site, and it became known as Area 52. And they built a whole setup specifically for the F-117. ♪♪ Feest: I was flying the F-15 at Langley Air Force Base, and my squadron commander called me in and shut the door and said, "Hey, are you interested in going to fly at the 4450th test group?" None of us knew what was going on, but we knew there was something highly classified and different. I decided to go. After you've checked out, they put you in a room and they turn on a projector and they show you pictures of the F-117 for the first time. And, usually, the first comment is, "That thing flies?" Because it doesn't look very aerodynamic. Morgenfeld: First test flight was my first flight in the F-117. So, what scared me more than anything isn't so much that something could happen physically to hurt me. It's the fact that we work very hard on airplanes to eliminate single-point failures, and the airplanes are very redundant. And you walk out to the airplane -- I am a single-point failure. If I goon it, I've ruined it for a lot of people, and it's very much a team effort. Brown: The idea of a pilot, you know, first flying an F-117 was pretty scary to me. I mean, at 4:30 in the morning, they'd be stuck into the cockpit. They open the hangar doors. There are no lights anywhere on the airfield. And they tell the guy, "Okay, you taxi out there, turn right, 1/2 mile, you get to the main runway, turn right again, take off." So you're taking off on a runway in the dark. "Oh, by the way, don't worry about the control system. It's completely disconnected from all the controls. It just goes to a computer, and the computer operates the controls because the airplane's basically unstable. Good luck. You'll be fine." ♪♪ Feest: You get acclimated to totally night-flying. We had flight surgeons and doctors that monitored what we did and decided that we had to do certain things to be able to fly at night and sleep during the day. So at Tonopah, we had room-darkening shades. They Velcroed black across our windows. So when we were in there during the day, you couldn't tell what time of day it was. They also had a rule that, at night, after flying, we had to be in our rooms before the sun came up, because the doctors said, "If the sun came up, your mind would go, 'Oh, something's wrong here.'" All of us are daytime creatures. We don't usually live in the black world. When you consider that there were something like 10,000 people that worked on the F-117 and they all kept this secret for 21 years, that's a remarkable piece of American history. On August 6th, in response to the unprovoked Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, I ordered the deployment of U.S. military forces to Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf. Iraq's brutality, aggression, and violations of international law cannot be allowed to succeed. President Bush made the decision to deploy 42 F-117s from Tonopah, Nevada, to Saudi Arabia. I'd been briefed on the F-117 for a number of years, and when it was deployed, you just had this sick feeling it was actually going to be used, that you're going to go to war. Mullins: A good friend of mine, Al Whitley, who was full colonel -- On the first night of the war, Whitley and one of his young pilots were walking out to get in their airplanes. They were both going to Baghdad. The pilot said to Whitley, "I hope this [bleep] works." ♪♪ Narrator: I had been convinced that stealth was the technology that will change the character of aerial warfare. If the enemy can't see the aircraft with radar, he can't hit it. The role of the 117 in the Gulf War was to wipe out the whole command-and-control system of Iraq, flying night missions. The design of the F-117 was to be the first ones in. We were told what the F-117 radar cross-section was, how it would perform, so we had to trust the engineers to Skunk Works. But I can tell you, flying the first night of Desert Storm, we're not sure, as pilots, whether or not the stealth technology's going to work. On the first night of the war, well, I felt an -- Every time I think about this, I felt an emotional attachment to these guys. This was their first-ever combat mission -- ever. [ Breathing shakily ] I used to go spend nights with them at Tonopah, so I knew these people and had become personal friends. ♪♪ We promised them a lot, and we'd never proved it.

Five months ago, Saddam Hussein started this cruel war against Kuwait. Tonight, the battle has been joined. The U.S. air strike was almost certainly designed to begin with these stealth fighters. Feest: The sky over Baghdad was lit up. I thought about the guys that were flying with me that night and I thought, "Those going into Baghdad are going to have it tough." Cappucio: The pilots on the 117 were very dicey. "Are they shooting at me? We know they're shooting." The question gets to be, "Why is the pattern so erratic?"

I checked in my wingman, and he answered. And then as we rejoined, I heard other pilots checking in, and I checked off the names as their call signs were read. And right before approaching my tanker, I looked down and I had a check mark next to every call sign, so I knew everybody was coming home that first night. Our 12 aircraft came back.

There's been an effort to develop an unmanned aerial vehicle called the Global Hawk and others that could actually replace the U-2, but each time it's about to be retired and finally put to rest, if you will, there's a recognition that what it provides is still uniquely worth preserving.

Carpenter: I equated the time I was able to spend with Kelly Johnson equivalent to the privilege of being able to fly the airplane because he was such a giant in his industry. He was the Leonardo da Vinci of aviation. His designs -- so unique. The guy's a genius. He combined really extraordinary technical knowledge with equally extraordinary leadership capacity. Kelly Johnson never, in a sense, got the credit that he was certainly due because of the covert nature of what was being done, but was not one, I don't think, who cared about that.

So we may be seeing, here, the highest-speed military airplane that there will be around for a long time. This is Dennis Quaid with "An American Portrait."
