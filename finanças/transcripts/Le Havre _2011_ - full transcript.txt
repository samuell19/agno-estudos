Enough. Poor devil. Luckily he had time to pay. Better go, they'll blame me anyway. The evening train? Of course. Money moves in the shadows. Enough. l called the police. But we're colleagues! Get going! Terrorist! Please come in. l'm sorry for the trouble. Fine cauliflowers. l'd like this one. Marcel? You gangster. Yvette, you were in? l didn't want to disturb you. Your bill's as long as the Congo River. Because l'm your best customer. When will you pay? When l inherit. But don't tell my wife. l'm the man of the house. Excuse me. - Closed. - l see your feet. lmpossible. l'm upstairs. l want to buy something. Good night! Evening, Laika. l'm home. l see that. You've been busy today. lt's in my nature. l don't know how to be idle. l'll prepare the dinner, but you have time for an aperitif. Don't spend it all. l'll take the dog. She can carry the change home. His name's Gérard Lenormand, not Lebreton. Amusing. You talk about a name, but it's a culture. - Brittany is a culture. - No. What culture? You think Mont Saint-Michel is in Brittany. lt is in Brittany. lt's in Le Couesnon. lt's a fact. You know, back home in Alsace - Enough about Alsace. Fine ducks there. What you talking about? That's heresy! l'll go earn my pension. Really tough to wake up at 4:00 a.m. A pleasant fellow. How's Arletty? Fine. She's preparing dinner and kicked me out. You don't deserve such a good wife. You're not worthy of her. No one is, so l'll do. She's protective and couldn't watch me lie in the gutter, a man in his prime. Foreigners see bums in a considerably more romantic light than we French. You're not too polite. Her first husband was violent and an athlete. Care for another? There's still time for one. You're listening to Reality Radio: Difficult Choices. Today we're talking about dishwashers. Our guest is Annette Verdoux from Electroflash. Good evening. This affects five million consumers. Let's start by asking, how long does a dishwasher last? Recent studies show that... their lives are being deliberately shortened... Won't you eat? l visited Florence today. She had a pot of cassoulet. - What is it? - More living dead. The container was shipped three weeks ago from Libreville in Gabon. Bound for London. Was supposed to take five days. Been here two days. A computer error. - Probably in Paris. lnspector Monet, Le Havre. You heard voices inside? More like a child crying. Baltic Queen. Wasn't she scrapped? This is number two. Formerly the Honolulu Star. What do you think? lf they've had water and oxygen, with luck - ls that necessary? Ministry of lnterior's orders. The Red Cross. How are you, madam? How are you? Tired? And the child? Are you mad? lt's a child. LE HAVRE TRAlN STATlON ONE OF THE CONTAlNER REFUGEES ON THE RUN ARMED AND DANGEROUS? CONNECTlONS TO AL-QAEDA? - Hi, Marcel, how are you? - Good. - Caught anything? - No. Dry as the Gobi. The Eskimos have stolen everything. Greedy devils. See you later. ls this London? You want to go there? lt's the other side. This is Le Havre, in Normandy. Are you hungry? Get up here. Could be a pensioner's metro card. No metro in Le Havre. Papers. We're looking for a black boy. He was seen around here. He needs care. So you always say. l've seen no one. Beat it. Don't forget your lunch. Nothing here. This morning, ruthlessly and without warning, the Jungle was destroyed. Migrants regrouped behind banners. "No Border" activists and the police clashed violently. Two groups were formed: underage youths, and adults. No solution is proposed. Just like with the earlier camp, nothing but the press releases were prepared. Migrants, activists and the journalists waited. This morning there were only 300 refugees, those with no other place to go. These last few days the Jungle was emptied out. A few weeks ago there were almost 1 ,000. Refugees are no longer in rue Calais, but the problem is not solved. Many of those arrested will soon be released. They look for new sites, just like in Sangatte. Almost ten years to the day. The Minister for lmmigration came to Calais to witness the camp's demolition. The operation was not aimed against the refugees. A YOUNG BOY ON THE RUN What do you think? Hard to say, since l don't exist. Who's he? That's you, Chang. l'm not Chang. l'm from Vietnam, not China. Came here 12 years ago on top of a train. Spent eight years paying for this identity in the databases. l can enjoy social security and vote, if l want to. l support my family. l'm a happy man. But l'm not him. You can call me Chang, l'm used to it. The Mediterranean has more birth certificates than fish. lt's harder to deport a nameless person. The evening train comes soon. Shall we go? - Evening, Marcel. - Jeanne. A sandwich and water. Water? lt's not for me. Sure. What is it? Stay there. Marcel. Turn off the stove. What's wrong? You weren't in the bar. No one knew where you were. l'll get an ambulance. Don't be long. Yvette! What is it? May l use the phone? Arletty must go to the hospital. l'll take you. lt'll be faster. l'll just get my coat. The husband of Arletty Marx? Yes. She's sleeping. We gave her painkillers. You can go home. We'll have the results this afternoon. l'd like to wait. That'd be no use. You'd just be in the way. Take my card. Thank you. Good morning, Yvette. How's Arletty? What did they say? She's sleeping. l go back in the afternoon. Shall l come? l'll be all right. Perhaps they'll let her come home. Perhaps. Laika? Came to pay your debt? You have a name? Speak. ldrissa. Quo vadis, ldrissa? What? - Where are you going? - London. What's there? You know the way? We'll talk later. l must go, but l'll be back. You can sleep on the couch. Don't go out, don't open the door. Understand? Yes, sir. So there's no hope? Miracles do happen. Not in my neighborhood. Please don't tell the truth to my husband. Embellish it. He's just a big child. lt's against the rules. l beg you. Tell him... later. The rules don't say when you must tell. All right. l'll talk like a politician. We'll begin the treatments next week. Be brave. l was too categorical. There's always hope. Doctor. Come to see me later. Yes, Dr. Becker. l didn't bring any food. How are you? - Much better. l was worried. l'm away for a moment and you start spending. l got them cheap. They were on sale. What am l saying? l bought the most expensive ones. Will you come home soon? l'll take care of you. l must stay, perhaps a long time. The doctor will explain. Let's talk about other things. Thank God it's benign. No danger then. That's what the doctor said. Evidently extremely benign. Still, they won't let her come home. They want to be certain. Care for another? No, thanks. On the house. ln that case, gladly. l'll visit her tomorrow. You remember the ward? Thirteen, same as the room. l'll go in the morning too. Santé! Thank you. Are you crazy? You don't listen at all. No wonder they put you on the ship. Sorry, but if you get caught, you won't get to London but back where you came from. You want that? No. l need time to help you. Central Police Station? l believe l have some information for you. Are you hungry? Did you eat anything? Yes. - Want some water? - No. l take a glass sometimes. Does you good and helps you to sleep. l used to live a bohemian life in Paris. My success was artistic only. We could drink a lot if we had a cause to celebrate. You don't understand? No, sir. Don't call me sir. We haven't been introduced. My, my. A civilized family. My father was a teacher. Marcel Marx. Call me Marcel. Yes, boss. l'll step out, then we'll continue. lnto the bedroom. Evening, Yvette. l brought some food. l'm not hungry. But someone inside might be. A plain omelet - one egg - and a small red wine. Right away, Mr. Marx. Mind if l join you? Nothing would please me more. A glass of Domaine de Courbissac, 2005. You live alone, Mr. Marx? With my wife. Why? lsn't she in the hospital? Leave my wife alone and go. What a temper. Prefer to talk at the station? On what grounds? My permit's fine. Like your income tax declaration, l'm sure. You misunderstand me. l came as a friend, to warn you. About what? Your neighbor, for example. l investigate crimes, not taxes or immigration. Understand? Good day. Marcel, wait. Thank you, Yvette. Could you hide the boy if necessary? Of course, gladly. Don't tell anyone. Of course not. You know me. Mr. Marx! Come here. l've sometimes been rude, but times are hard. l have groceries going old and l thought of you. Sit down. l need names. Who are your parents? Where do you come from? Start from the beginning. Do you know Mahamat Saleh's family? Go over there. l'll write down instructions for you. Finish the polish with a cloth. This one? Yes. And do it well. l need them tonight. There are better professions but besides shepherds, it's closest to the people. And the last to respect the Sermon on the Mount. Put a leash on Laika. We're going for a visit. Will you take him? l'm off to Calais. - How long? - A few days. Don't let the boy out. Buy him some clothes and make him take a shower. Don't worry. Thanks, Yvette. l have important things to do. l can't come tomorrow. l'll tell you later. Be brave. Your taxi will be here soon. There's a camp on the shore off Dunkerque. l know it. - Do you know Mahamat Saleh? - Talk to him. May l have a moment? Got a cigarette? Sure. - Want to eat? - No, thanks. l'm looking for Mahamat Saleh. l heard he'd be here. Who told you? His compatriots in Le Havre. Why are you looking for him? For his grandson. Why should l believe you? Because of my blue eyes. He's not here. He was taken to a refugee center. Which one? The one here, in Calais. His brother! Are you mocking me? l'm the family albino. And unluckily for you, a journalist and a lawyer. Know what the law says about discrimination based on skin color? l never - Don't make it worse. l recorded everything. - Fetch Mahamat Salem. - Yes, Director. The boy's mother has been in London for a year already. She has no residence permit but a good job in a Chinese laundry. The address is: 248 Whitechapel Road, at the back. Can you remember? - l'll write it down later. My son was going to follow her soon with ldrissa, but... he was - He died. And what will you do? The bucket returns to the well until it breaks. l'm an old man anyway. But if you can - l give you my word. l'm not alone. l have friends. Please let me know. Don't let them deport the boy. l won't. A wonderful little girl. Full of life and joy. My cousin has a daughter with a man, but they're not married. Our family had a similar tragedy in the '50s. lsn't it wonderful that two young people love each other? Why should society dictate what's right or wrong? Police? The boy is at the train station. - Stay there. - Let me go! Wait peacefully. The police are coming. - Run. - Listen, you! You'll be in trouble. ldrissa has disappeared. l checked your home too. - When? This morning. l was in my shop. Calm down. l'll find him. Good afternoon, Laika. Where's ldrissa? - You been crying? - No. Good. lt won't help. Greetings from your grandfather. He's well and told you to obey me. He stressed that. One moment. Enter. Marcel, you mustn't see me like this. Like what? So thin and ugly. You told me once you hate thin women. Ones who don't appreciate food. Thin is even better. How come? For example, clothes take less fabric. ln a small car, you have room for more. So you'd like more wives? You misunderstand me on purpose. Chocolate? There, you see. You're telling the truth? lt's not serious? l wouldn't deceive you. lf you say so. More than that. l promise. But now the treatments begin and l must be alone. l must not see anyone. Not even me? Especially not you. You upset my equilibrium. Would that be bad? Extremely bad. Come back in two weeks. And when you come, bring my yellow dress. The one l wore in La Rochelle. Remember? l remember. But according to Matthew, chapter 12, we are no longer in agreement. But Luke says the kingdom of heaven is happy and the gates open for the innocent. But Christ returned to Earth. Good afternoon, lnspector. Good afternoon, Mr. Prefect. Please sit down. The press are following this case closely. lt is imperative that we make progress quickly. Yes, Mr. Prefect. You have had a long career. Very long. You are our best investigator. Find the boy and deliver him to the authorities. The sooner the better. For all of us. l understand, Mr. Prefect. Good-bye, Mr. Prefect. Go inside. A certain Marcel Marx lives nearby. Tell me about him. With pleasure. One of my best customers. Regular as clockwork. Won't let an unpaid bill wake him up. Wife in the hospital? Yes. Poor woman. l heard there's no hope. How does Marx take it? Crushed. Puts on a brave face. Anyone else with him? Family? No one. Just a dog. Poor beast. Misses her mistress. Thanks for the information. l only did my duty. l love society. Won't you buy something, lnspector? A pineapple. A pineapple it is. A calvados. Leave. Evening, Henri. For me? No. l heard about your husband. My condolences. What for? He was a fatalist. l put him behind bars. That's what cops do. He would've died anyway. What do you want? Marcel Marx. You care about him? Yes. Very much. "ln the distance a train rolled into view. All the compartments were lit, the windows were down. One of us began to sing a ditty, but we all wanted to sing. We sang faster than the train was going. We waved our arms because our voices were not enough. Our voices rushed together in an avalanche of sound that did us good. When one joins in song with others, it is like being drawn on by a fish hook. We sang into the ears of the distant passengers. Grown-ups were still awake, mothers prepared beds. Our time was up. l kissed the one next to me, offered my hand to the nearest three. l began to run back along the road. No one called after me. When they could see me no more l turned and ran along the farm roads, into the forest again. l went south towards that city of which it is said: Strange people live there! They don't sleep! Why not? They don't grow tired. Why not? Because they are mad. Don't mad people grow tired? How could the mad grow tired?" She's asleep. SHORT STORlES My cousin's brother-in-law will do it. We could swap cargoes in international waters. But it's expensive, the risk is big. The boat may be confiscated. For us, it's enough if you pay the fuel. And the Englishman? 3,000 euros. l'll get the money... but l need a bit of time. Thanks, Francis. l won't forget this. An enormous sum. l've saved up some. Yvette doesn't deserve to inherit. She's so reckless. To open up a bakery during times like these. l've saved up 200 for my daughter's bike. lt can wait. She's only two weeks old. Thank you, but l really couldn't. l'll have to manage. Arrange a charity concert. lt's very trendy. But l can't play at all. - Hire Little Bob. - lmpossible. Why? He won't play until Mimie returns. Has Mimie left? Yes. They had a fight. About what? Gardening. An apple tree, apparently. How long has she been gone? Three weeks now. Where can l find this Mimie? All right, but only if Roberto apologizes. Thank you, Jacquotte. Mr. Bob, l know you've had differences with your wife. But l'd like to arrange a trendy charity concert with your help. Only if Mimie comes back. Without her, my voice lacks substance. She's the road manager of my soul. What did you argue about? Just something trivial. But she must understand who's the man of the house. lt can't be her. lf l can persuade her to come back, would you apologize? l'd dance a minuet. Mimie. Roberto. THE RETURN OF LlTTLE BOB - Hi, ldrissa. - Mr. Chang. We're waiting. What do you mean? The concert begins in four hours. What concert? Are you drunk? The Little Bob concert you arranged. But it's tomorrow. According to the poster, the band and the audience, it's today. Shit. ldrissa. Take this to my wife at Flaubert Hospital. Her name's Arletty. Tell her l'll come tomorrow. Listen carefully. l'll explain how to get there. - Can l help you? - Room 1 3? End of the hall. Come in. Looking for me? Are you Mrs. Arletty? lt's from Marcel Marx. He can't come today. He'll come tomorrow. And who are you, if l may ask? ldrissa Saleh, a friend of your husband. What brought you to Le Havre? l came by acciident. Have you known Marcel for long? No. Just a couple of weeks. Madame. Yes? Try to get well soon. Mr. Marx won't manage without you. l agree. Madame. Good-bye. And good luck. Good-bye. To you, too. Thank you. You'd better go. lnspector Monet, what a surprise. And this early. lt's in my nature. May l come in? By all means. The dark side of my work is that people don't like us. People scream for us to help. But are they grateful? Not a bit. lt doesn't really bother me because l don't much like people. But it seems to disturb my colleagues, especially the younger ones. lt may be hard to believe that my heart has its tender spots. l'm ruthless towards criminals, but l don't like to see the innocent suffer. Not you. You're not innocent. And never have been. That's true. Naturally, l'm here completely unofficially, and l thank you for inviting me in. A nasty wind is blowing outside. l couldn't give you advice without committing a breach of duty. Naturally. So, we agree. On my day off, and as your friend, permit me to think aloud. Here, it's your privilege. lf l were you - You must find this unpleasant. On the contrary. Don't exaggerate. lf l was a smuggler - this is just hypothetical, of course - and l had a valuable package l did not want the border police to get - They deal with smuggling as well as illegal immigration, you know. Your hypothesis is interesting. So, if l were you, l'd get rid of the package as soon as possible. Gauthier, Goupil, Hébert, the street. The rest, follow me. Don't move. Madame, we have to check the premises. Go ahead, gentlemen. We have to check the premises. Talk to my wife. With pleasure, young man. Good morning. Good morning, Jean-Pierre. True. lt goes well with scallops. Yes, but you have to shell them and make the sauce and everything. Right, l won't make scallops. They're following you. l know. ls the boy safe? l hope so. God willing, he leaves today. A white. May l go out the back? Lock the door, Luc. Go. - Cauliflowers! - Sold out. Go and sell your stuff to the rich! l'm sorry. What a greengrocer! Liar! My husband'll kill me. Have a nice voyage. Get going, Chang! Thank you. l won't forget you. Me neither. Say hello to your wife for me. Take this. Your mother's address. Thanks, Francis. - You dirty - - Don't make it worse. Do you smoke? Move aside. The hold is empty. l've got orders. Are you questioning my authority, Officer? No, lnspector. You may go. l was wrong about you. May l apologize with a drink? Why not? A calvados. Follow me, Mr. Marx. You can pick up her things later. Corinne, take him to Dr. Becker. Right. l'm sorry, Mr. Marx. l don't know what happened. Medicine has never encountered this. Everything indicated the opposite. l heard about a patient in Shanghai who healed in seconds, but here in France - l'm cured. The disease is gone. Let's go home, Marcel. Look, Marcel. The cherry tree is in bloom. l'll make dinner right away.
