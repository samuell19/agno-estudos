I'm glad you're still here. Have you given any more thought to what we discussed? She stays on the machine. She's suffering, Mr. Palmer. She's been on these machines for five years. I think it may be time... to let her go. This is the last time we're gonna have this conversation. If you ever ask me to pull the plug on my daughter again, I will kill you. Do you understand me? Is everything okay, boss? Everything's fine, Shadow. The captain just called. The shipment will be arriving tonight. Should I mobilize the boys? Yes, but for a different job. I'm gonna let John and his men handle the shipment. Any word from Dr. Majed about the Interface? Not yet. But we're gonna go pay him a visit. Claire. It's been a week since-- This isn't healthy. What do you want? Dr. Johnson is here. You coming? Sure. Can I help you? I'm looking for Michelle Satorius. That's my mom. Come in. Have we met before? I don't-- You don't recognize me? You don't know a, uh, Jim Hopkins in California, or a Kaley Hopkins? Is she gonna be okay? She needs the transplant. Her condition is deteriorating since your father passed away. We should get her home right away. Why would we do that? So she can be with her family-- We are her family. She shouldn't do any traveling right now. She needs to rest. She can continue her treatment when she gets back home. Her condition needs to stabilize before she can travel. She needs at least a week's worth of treatments, before we can even think about getting her on a plane. I have to go. I'll stop by later. -What was that all about? -What? You're sitting out here, instead of coming inside and talking with the doctor? And why are you trying to get rid of her? Oh, wait, let me see. Because she abandoned us. Which part of that don't you understand? If you want to keep pretending like she never left us, -be my guest. -I'm not pretending. And by the way, are you going to do the test to donate her a kidney? Or do I really have to ask? Why would I want to do that? Because she's your mother... -and she's dying. -So what? And that gives her the right to show up here, now, playing the dying card? I don't owe her anything. You know, I get that you're angry and maybe you have every reason to be, but right now is not the time to hold a grudge. I don't understand you. You barely know her, but you were totally willing to give her an organ right out of your body? She's our mother. And like it or not, she's the last bit of family we have left. You need to be there for her. If not for her, then... do it for me. Or Dad. You know that's what he would have wanted. People ask me why I got in this line of work... given that I have a Masters in finance. Do you know why? A car accident left my wife a quadriplegic and my daughter in a coma. Massive medical bills. As I ventured into this business, it seemed that the richer I got, the more my wife's health deteriorated. I wasn't there for my wife, right up until the day she died. You run a criminal empire that is responsible for some horrific things. Nothing you say can justify what you do. No offense. None taken. You see, I was driving the car. The accident was my fault. I failed my wife. But you have to understand, I will do whatever it takes to save my daughter. -Mr. Palmer. -Ah, Dr. Majed, come. Sit with us. Any progress on the Interface? Yes, we are making some significant progress. Very close to a breakthrough. Your father promised me that he would save my daughter's life if I would buy E-Link Tech and finance the Interface device. I'm a patient man. I realize these things take time. But three years is a lot of time... and now I've run out of patience. Mr. Pal-- My daughter's life is now hanging in the balance. And as of right now, so is yours. If I don't have a working Interface device by the end of this month... your daughter is gonna pay the price for your incompetence. Dad, we have to leave, or that madman will kill us. With the sort of influence he has, nowhere is safe. We can go to Iran. I've worked so hard to give us a better life. I won't throw all that away. We'll be okay. I can do this. I want to talk to you, girls. I have things to do. Are you sure you're in the right house? Hey, Dad. Isn't Mike's mom named Michelle, too? - Mike? - The kid next door. The new neighbors. I can show you the house if you'd like. That won't be necessary. Sorry to bother you. Claire. You never told them about us, did you? No, no. And you shouldn't have shown up here like this. You could have destroyed my family. We're your family, too. That was my past life. And I need to keep it that way. I'm sorry about Claire. She just needs some time. What did you want to talk to us about? We'll talk about it later when both of you are here. But just so you know, I'm thinking it might be best if I leave in the next few days. I don't want to upset Claire. She's been through a lot. Is everything okay between the two of you? Yeah. Why? I don't know, I just feel like I sensed some tension between you two. Oh, yeah. We're good. We just get along better when she's not around. Why is that? Is it because she's closer to your father? Do you feel left out? I can tell. Mm. I wasn't able to get close to Dad until after she went to college. Growing up, they were so close to the point that he didn't feel the need to bond with me. In any way, shape, or form. Over the years, I've been able to respect what they have and make peace with it. But now that you're here... and I'm hoping to have that same kind of close relationship with you... she's being selfish and she's ruining everything. No. You can't blame Claire for how she feels about me. It's not her fault. I know. I can see how much you're hurting and I'm so sorry. I am so, so sorry. I should have been here for you. I should have been here for both of you. Can you forgive me? Yeah. And I am really loving this hair. It's really-- it's really good. -It looks really good. -Thank you. -That red. -Mm-hmm. The subjects are here. Bring in the first one. Will it work? In theory, yes, but we'll know for sure in a moment. Have you been briefed on what's going to happen? I just have to go in and establish connection, right? And then I get my money? Right. The Interface will create a virtual environment, based on what her mind is projecting, enabling you to interact and communicate with her on a subconscious level. Are you ready? Just relax. It's not going to hurt. Pay attention to every detail and try and remember as much as you can. Something isn't right. It's damaging his brain. We have to stop! No. Wait and see what happens. If we don't stop now, it's going to kill him. He's dead. Bring in the next one. I will not experiment on another person. Anyone who sits in that chair today will die. No matter how many times we try. Without further study or adjustments to the Interface, you may as well just execute them. I need more time. Finish it. You know what the stakes are. I don't need to remind you. You okay? You look like you've just seen a ghost. Yeah, I'm fine. Remember when Dad used to bribe us... to come hang out with him while he was building this? Mm-hmm. Oh, you hated coming in here. Nah, I didn't really mind the bribing part. What I didn't like, was him boring me with all that scientific stuff. It made me feel like I was still in school. I miss him. Me too. I still can't believe he, um... abandoned the project. We worked on it for so long. I think that... it is just for the best. You know what they say. Some things aren't meant to be tampered with. Shit. Lunch. Go. I need to know more about these pills that she's been taking. We already had this conversation. We can't. Look. Things are different now. God forbid, your mother could die at any moment. If that happens... the coroner will find traces of the drug in her system. The drug isn't FDA approved. Do you know what that will cost me? My license. Maybe we should tell him. Are you insane? The sender could get in trouble. We could get in trouble. And so could the doctor. If you won't tell him, fine. I will. Hello. Hi. My name is Claire. And yours? Peter. So you're the one who's been sending us the pills. I don't know what you're talking about. Don't play dumb. I just saw you put them in our mailbox and I've seen your car parked in front of my house for weeks. You shouldn't have followed me. I have to go. Wait. You haven't sent the pills in weeks. Why? I don't have access to the pills. I'm sorry, that's my last delivery. My mother's life depends on these pills. Look, if there was anything I could do-- Could you tell me how you've been getting them? I can get them myself. I doubt that. The pills came from GSA Pharmaceuticals. They're not on the market. The only reason that I had access to them was because I worked there. Look, I'm sorry... but I have to go. Why did you send us the pills? It is a really long story and I really have to go. I need to know. Why are you helping my mother? How-- you don't even know us. And how do you know about her condition? If you really want answers, come to Barham Boulevard tomorrow at 10 AM. Apartment 214. It's nine. -I said 10 AM. -I couldn't wait. So, do you go to school around here? Georgia Tech. What's your major? Computer science. How long you lived out there? A year. But enough with the small talk. Why don't you start by telling me why you don't have access to the pills anymore? The pills are experimental. I mean, they filter waste out of the bloodstream, so they do help with kidney failure, but they're still in clinical trials. There just wasn't always a consistent supply for me to get at. My internship ended. I was able to grab that last bottle on my final day as I was leaving. Thank you... for all of your help these past few months. I'm just trying to understand how you know about my mother. It's complicated. Who is this guy? That's my best friend, Mark. So, are you going to keep dodging the question? I overheard you, your sister... and her doctor talking about her kidney failure. I was in my car outside your house. Why were you watching us? -Peter? -I did it because... I felt guilty. Guilty about what? On the night-- on the night... of the hit and run with your father... I was the one behind the wheel. I'm-- I'm the one who's responsible for his death. I'm so, so sorry. Claire, I did not know what to do. I panicked. Claire, I panicked. What? Michelle had a seizure. Wait, what? Is she going to wake up? I wish I could say yes. With the preliminary MRI's... it showed very low brain activity. What does that mean? The chances of her regaining consciousness... are remote. Can anything be done for her? Short of a kidney transplant? No. You should be able to visit with her in the next half an hour or so. Thanks. I'll wait in the hall. What is that? Oh. This is an Interface. It's a machine to bring people back from a coma. -Wait, do you mean-- -Oh, no, no, no. It doesn't work. The man that invented the tech, passed away before he could complete it. His colleague recently attempted a human trial. It was unsuccessful. Would you mind if I take a look at that? I-- it'd be a great distraction. Dr. Johnson, come to the ER. All right. Dr. Johnson, come to the ER, please. Just put the file back on my desk before you leave. What? I think there may be a way to bring Michelle back using this... this Interface. Was he speaking Chinese when he said it doesn't work? What am I missing? A lot. But it's too dangerous. Dangerous? Claire, if there's a way to save Michelle, if it's possible, then we have to do it. It's too dangerous. And to be honest it's not worth the risk. I get that you two have your differences and not wanting to donate an organ is one thing... which now can't even save her life, if you were even willing to do it. But if you can save her and you don't... that will be the end of us. And I will never forgive you. I have to go. I'm assuming you're Claire? Yes, Dr. Majed. My assistant said you called asking about the Interface. How do you know about it? -Palmer send you? -Who? No, I saw plans for it on my mother's doctor's desk. Johnson. He's supposed to keep those plans under wraps. -The device is not completed. -I know. But I wanted to see how long it would be until it works. My mother is in a coma, and wanted to-- We won't be trying it on you or anyone else. The Interface does not work. But, you see, I think it will work. I've been having these visions. -I'm a very busy man. -I know it sounds crazy. I must go. Forget you ever heard about the Interface. You have no idea what you'd be getting yourself into. Dr. Majed, please, I really need your help. Don't call again. You coming? Not until you tell me where the hell we're going. I told you, we need the Interface. I thought that doctor blew you off? Which is why we're here. Look, something is happening, Kaley, I can't-- I can't explain it. At least not yet. Okay. Say I believe you. How are we gonna get our hands on that Interface? Nobody's just gonna hand it over to us. That's why we're here. To see Peter. Who is Peter? Peter is... the guy that... killed Dad. What? He's been sitting in his car outside of the house for weeks watching us. I followed him yesterday after he left the house. And? Did you call the cops? Why? It's complicated. He's also the one who's been sending us the pills. And you let him just walk away? Are you fucking kidding me? There's nothing I could have done. How was he gonna send us the pills if he was in jail? He stopped sending us the damn pills, remember? -Calm down. -He lives in this building? - That's enough, Kaley. - What the hell? That was a promise. When this is all over, you will pay for what you did to my father. Well, that was quite an introduction. He-- he deserves it, but-- but that's not cool. Not cool? Hitting my father with a car and then driving away like a coward, that's not cool. You have a point there. Did you even call the police? Or just knowingly leave my father there -in the street to die? -Of course I called the police. Before speeding off like a coward. Not helping, Mark. So, who the hell are you? I'm Mark. The coward's best friend. -Ah. -Thanks for that. She said "When this is all over." When what's all over? Hey, asshole. I'm right here. Why don't you ask me? No, thank you. You have a gun, right? Wait, what? -How did you know-- -Can I borrow it? If you want to shoot me, you're gonna have to get your own gun. If I wanted revenge, we wouldn't even be having this conversation. Then what do you need a gun for? That is actually an excellent question, Claire. It's none of your business, but you owe me this. Look. Whatever you need this for, it can't be good. Tell me what's going on. Maybe I can help. What Peter actually meant to say is, "Hell no." Uh, thanks for coming by. Bye-bye. You want to help? We could use the manpower. Sure. Whatever you need. Can I talk to you for a second? Claire, he's the last person we should seek help from. I know. But like you said, this is no time to hold a grudge. I need help to execute the plan. And unless you know anyone else who would be willing to risk their lives ASAP, Peter and Mark are the only option. Risk their lives? Claire, what is the plan? I will tell you when we get there. You have to trust me. We have to report Peter to the police when this is all over. I wouldn't have it any other way. Okay. Look, I-- I know you feel bad about what happened and you want to set things right, but you don't even know what the hell you're getting yourself involved with. It doesn't matter. I need this. More than you could ever know. You guys don't believe me, do you? So, like, when you're having these visions, do you use a crystal ball or something? -What? -Or is it like tarot cards? Were you even listening? I'm not psychic. Well, then how do you explain the visions? How could you have seen us all together without ever having met us? I don't know. Look, we need to go. Peter and I will go in first and I'll signal to you two when to come in. Get in. -Dad? -No, sit down. Tie her up. Tie her up! Okay, sit down. This is very important. Is there anybody else in this house? Is anybody else in the house? No. Stay with her. I'm gonna have a little chat with Dr. Majed. Please, don't hurt my daughter. She doesn't know anything about this. Whether your daughter makes it out of this alive is entirely up to you. What do you want? I told you, the Interface does not work. Like I said, I think it will work. How much longer will it take? I don't know. Everyone needs to stop asking. I don't think I need to remind you what's at stake here, Dr. Majed. Honestly, I don't know. It could take months, years. Well, if it's gonna take you that long then I'm gonna have to take it off your hands and handle it myself. I don't have it. It's at the lab, at E-Link Tech. Well, why don't you get dressed? We're going to E-Link Tech. Stay with her. Wait for my call. Stay focused and keep your eyes open. Who do you work for? No one. You seem to know a lot about the Interface, so I'm guessing you also know it belongs to Otto Palmer. You have no idea who you're stealing from. You're gonna get us all killed. Stop talking and get the Interface. Dr. Majed, as you walk over there, I want you to ask yourself... if the Interface is worth losing your family over. Don't try anything stupid. Are you sure you want to go through with this? I'm fine. It's not me you should be worried about. The family will be fine. And we're not causing any trauma that... a week of therapy can't fix. That's a callous way of justifying what I'm putting them through. Is that what you told yourself... when you ran over my dad and drove away? Go home. Your family is safe. If you contact the police, we know where to find you. The police are the least of your problems. We have a problem. Why are you pacing? What if they're not coming back? All right? What if they got caught? They're definitely coming back, okay? They said just to wait here until they did. Just take a deep breath. Everything is gonna be fine. Mr. Palmer, I'm so sorry. They had my family at gunpoint. Get in. You said you have their location? Yes. I planted a tracking and a listening device on the briefcase. Excellent. Um, are you gonna tell us what you're thinking or what? Feregamo is the key. We need to find him. Wait, who's Feregamo again? He's the guy that invented the Interface. Um, pretty sure his exact coordinates are grave, six foot deep? I know he's dead in our dimension. We need to find an alternate dimension where he's still alive and have him finish the Interface. -But Claire-- -I know, it's dangerous to open a portal. Dad abandoned the project for that very reason, but we have no other choice. It's the only way. Okay, let's go back to your plan for a second. According to the file, Feregamo died about three years ago, which means that he's dead in every dimension. Sure, there's a slight time difference between dimensions, but it's not that significant. Hours, days, and even weeks? Sure. But three years? Not if we're on the same timeline. Whoa, whoa, whoa, time out ladies. What the hell are you talking about? Just watch. Step back. Holy shit. What is that thing? That is a portal that leads to alternate dimensions. Alternate? Self-contained reality. Co-existing with ours, I know. But isn't that stuff supposed to be science fiction? Uh, apparently not. You guys have a portal in your basement and the world doesn't know about this? Our father decided to be quiet about it, because he believed opening portals between dimensions could have some serious repercussions. How do you know so much about it? Um, you moved across the country a year ago. Who do you think got to be his new assistant? I'm surprised, I thought you weren't-- What? Smart enough to understand it? No, I just thought you weren't interested in this kind of thing. When I was younger, not so much, but it's really grown on me over the last year. Oh. And just because I'm on dance team doesn't mean I can't be good at science. -I don't think that-- -Yeah, you do. No, I just-- I didn't know. Well, there's a lot that you never knew about me. As entertaining as this is, can we pause the soap opera for a minute and just-- We're still a little in shock about the whole travel to alternate dimensions in time thing. Have you two been there to another-- Not yet. But they're like here. Everything is identical. So my plan is to not find a dimension where Feregamo isn't dead yet... but where he doesn't die at all. I don't understand. You said that everything is identical. So if Feregamo is dead in our dimension, doesn't it stand to reason that he's dead in every dimension? Not necessarily. Sometimes there are slight differences in people's lives. Let's say there are ten dimensions in our time and in each one of them, Feregamo is a research scientist. Give me a pen. Except in one, he's a surgeon. This divergence can be traced back to a decision he made at some point in his life that's different than the rest before. Damn. Boss is a real psycho. So, if we are to follow your logic, then he could still be alive in one of those other dimensions. Yes. Feregamo was shot in his home during a robbery gone wrong. Maybe in one of these dimensions, he didn't come home from work that night, or maybe he came home and then left at some point, or maybe he survived the gunshot. I mean, I could come up with a million scenarios as to how one of the Feregamos could still be alive. And I could come up with a trillion reasons why the chances of that happening are less than zero. I'm not an expert or anything, but from a logic standpoint... I think Kaley's right. - Yeah. - Of course she's right. Expecting this man to be alive is like wishing Peter would get hit by a bus next Monday at 2 PM and thinking it could actually happen. Why am I the one getting hit by the bus in this scenario? Because you're unlucky, man, bad shit always happens to you. That is a true statement. Nothing good ever really goes your way. -Yup. -It's like this dark, stormy cloud follows you ev-- I think I got it, Mark. All I'm saying is your karma is cursed. Are you two done? Look, based on my visions, it seems at some point today, we will end up with a working Interface. I think that's how it will happen. Feregamo was the only person who can get it to work within this short of a time frame. It's a long shot, but you're gonna have to trust me. You seem pretty confident... so I trust you. Good. And one more thing. The Interface we just stole belongs to Otto Palmer. What? Otto Palmer, as in the CEO? You're joking, right? Why would Otto Palmer own E-Link Tech? He bought E-Link Tech, because of the Interface project. His daughter got into an accident a few years back. She has been in a coma ever since. And you expect us to go along with this? It's like you tricked us into committing suicide. Why are you so quiet? Did you know about this? I didn't sign up for this. Otto Palmer? -I'm out. -I'm staying. -You're crazy. -Mm-hmm. Do you guys have a death wish or something? You and Palmer want the same damn thing. The smart play would have been to approach him about working on it together. Go in and secure the place. Verify that they can open a portal. And bring me Claire. What do you think? If what we heard is true... her plan is sound. Given how close Feregamo was to breakthrough, I think he could do it in a short period of time. Get in. Don't look back. Give us a minute. Do you know who I am? Do you know why I'm here? I think I have an idea. How did you know where I was? The briefcase has a transmitter. How do you know your plan will work? You seem so sure. It has a listening device, too. I heard every word you said about the portal. The only reason you're still breathing is because I need the answer to that question. So, start talking. I've been having these visions. Visions? Yeah, but more like a quantum entanglement. A what? So, if my plan is to use the Interface to get into Michelle's mind and bring her back from a coma, then it's safe to say that every Claire in every dimension has a similar plan, right? Right, but get to the point. Because of the time difference between dimensions, I believe some of my doppelgangers might have already Interfaced with Michelle in their dimensions. Because when I have these visions... I don't just see things... I experience them. It's like my consciousness has been transferred to a different body and becomes part of a larger mind. I'm confused. What I'm basically saying is I have these visions every time one of my doppelgangers is Interfacing with Michelle in their dimensions. In one of my visions, the real Claire in Michelle's mind has a dragon tattoo on her arm and wore glasses to see. As you can see, I have neither of those things. How is that even possible? I'm not entirely sure, but my theory is that sometimes their connection is so strong, that every Claire in every dimension becomes one universal entity. It explains why, at least for a brief moment... we're all in the same place, doing the exact same thing. So then, they got the Interface to work at some point? Yeah. Are you sure about this theory of yours? Yes. When you start bridging between dimensions, quantum entanglement is one of those rare phenomena that could occur. Good. You work for me now. And in exchange for that, I'll spare your lives for stealing from me. If I get it to work, I'll have to save my mom first. If it works on her, it'll be safe to try on your daughter. Fine. -But if you fail me-- -I won't. But I'm gonna need my team. Your sister stays with my men for insurance, but you can take one of the boys. Now get out of my car. What's going on? You go ahead and drive Boss back. Are you sure about this? It's a long shot, she seems to know what she's doing. Get rid of them when she comes back, dump the bodies in another dimension. The mother, too. I'll have someone bring her over. And I want that portal machine. It would be useful, if the Interface doesn't work. So, what does Mr. Palmer want? A working Interface, or we're all dead. Wait, so we work for him now? That's what he thinks. I don't trust him. Peter, you're coming with me. You two are gonna stay here with his men until we get back. You're leaving me alone with this guy? Hey, this guy happens to be training in the fine arts of Taekwondo. Oh, yeah? For how long? About a week. I had a Groupon. -Please, take me with you. -I can't. You have to stay here. What is this? You guys are still here? You ready? Stay safe, guys. Come back alive. Wow. It's like the same, but not. Hey, let's go. So, how do you know where he lives? Well, in our dimension, he lives in 2599 Parliament Street, so I figured if he's still alive in this dimension, he would live in the same place. What if he doesn't? Then all I need is a computer to find out. Claire. Check this out. To Claire and Peter. "Feregamo is dead in this dimension. And also in 84, 85, and 88. Please add the coordinates of the dimensions you've been to to this list to help narrow down the search for others. Please leave note if you find him." I'm confused. Because of the time difference between dimensions, some of the other doppelgangers are ahead of us. That's not a bad thing. At least that means we don't have to do a lot of the heavy lifting. Yeah. Come on. Peter. Come on. Let's go. Go! I'll meet you on the other side. I can handle him. Go. Hurry! What the fuck? Sir. Sir, did you see anyone come out of there? Sir, did you see anything? You know, when Shadow asked me to stay here because you might show up... I thought he was wasting my time. -Where's Feregamo? -I have the gun. I ask the fucking questions. Hands up. Talk. You don't know what you've gotten yourselves into, do you? This inter-dimensional idol you guys got going on, is gonna end with every last one of you in the fucking morgue. She's probably already dead anyways. So, it means that she was here. If you do not tell me what it is that I need to know, I swear to God... I know a killer when I see one. And you don't have the fucking balls. Where's Claire? Where's Feregamo? The crew has them. They're at the house. -In this dimension. -Why have they taken her? We're stranded here. We need her to open up the portal, so we can get back home. And what the hell do you need with Feregamo? We need him to finish the Interface. - No. - Yes, I am. I'm gonna seize the opportunity while I can. Hello? Yeah. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Mm, yeah, they're here. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Move a muscle and I'll blow your brains out. Go. Turn around. What the hell are you doing? Tell him to drop his weapon. What? You think I'm bluffing? Of course you are. Shoot this bitch, for God's sake. Fuck! Damn. I said shoot her! The next bullet is gonna go straight into your spine. Tell him to drop his fucking weapon. Drop the weapon. Sho-- Drop it. -Move. -Go. Give me the gun. There's tape in the chest. Damn. You look mighty comfy in here. Isn't this a crime scene or something? Where's Claire? Why don't you put that gun away and beg for mercy? And maybe I'll-- Are you reading my mind or something? I was just about to offer you something similar. Where is she? - Start talking or-- - Or what? I'm the only one that knows where she is, so you're not gonna shoot me. But if you don't get that gun out of my sight... I'm gonna blow his fucking brains out. Come on, man. Don't be like that. We both need each other alive. Who said I needed you alive? Hey. Hey, Dr. Feregamo. -Water. -What, water? Here, here. Go ahead. Okay, you're safe. Okay, you're safe now. Oh. -You two again? Jesus Christ-- -No, no, no, no. Whoever you saw, that was not us. Well, it was us. It just wasn't us. Wait, so that means that you've seen my friend? A version of her, I think. -Do you know where she is now? -No. Wait, did they mention anything about her? Anyway, I'm done helping you guys. -Wait, wh-- -No, it almost killed me. I-- I was almost off the grid and these two idiots found me. Wait, no, no, if-- if-- no. If you don't help my friend, Claire, her mother will die. Or did you know that already, didn't you? Help us. Help us. Please. Please. Okay, but you're the last bunch of doppelgangers I'll deal with. Thank you. I got an Interface processor that works. Gonna need some adjusting. Great. Hey, hey, wake up. Hey, wake up! I found him. He said he's gonna help us. Dr. Feregamo, thank you for helping us. What happened here? As you can see... things turned out differently, here in this dimension. What are we gonna do with these fuckers? Oh. Stay here with them and I'll go check it out. What the hell? Who the hell are you? How is she even breathing on her own? She was on life support, because her heartrate was too low, not because she can't breathe. Where's Shadow? Um, not here. Then why is his car still here? He took my car. They went to go get dinner. Man's gotta eat, right? Whatever. I gotta go. I'll give him a call. You got this, right? Mm-hmm. -Who brought her? -Some guy. Why? I'm not sure. But I think they want to get rid of us, including her. Will you help me carry her upstairs? Everything all right? Well, having your father die, your estranged mother show up uninvited, and then fall into a coma and having to chase down an Interface machine through alternate dimensions with the man who killed said father... kind of puts a damper on things. Touché. Look, I know I'm probably the last person that you want to confide in right now. -Yup. -But... I'm a really good listener. Fine. We don't have to talk. It's my mother. Who would have thought that I would ever risk my life to save her? You two weren't on good terms? I know the feeling... but it's not too late for you to make amends with your mother. My father passed away thinking that I hated him. I mean, I used to. Why? My father was well off. I mean, financially. And when I was young, I-- I was a bad kid. Okay? My father did not like me very much, probably 'cause of my attitude. And then he decided to ship me to a boarding school halfway across the world, to give me, as he called it, "behavioral modifications." And every month or so, he would slash my monthly budget and give me half of what I actually needed, you know, for, like, food and stuff. All so I could struggle to survive. That's extreme. And I hated him for it. What changed your feelings towards him? Time, I guess. I mean, he could be a real bastard, but he was still my dad, you know? I-- I think he wanted what was best for me... wanted me to stop acting out. He just... went about it in a really bad way. He passed away while I was away at school... so... there's no time for me to make things right with him. It's too late. But... maybe it's not too late for you. Make peace with your mother, Claire. Move on. Thanks, Dr. Phil, but I think my situation is a little bit different than yours. It sounded like your father might have actually given a crap about how you turned out. My mother didn't. If she didn't care, she would have come back to make amends while she was dying. Yeah, she's dying. She waited until the last minute when there's... That's why we're doing all this. So that you guys can have more time. Better be worth it. Family's always worth it. Yeah, well, I'm doing this for my sister. Not for Michelle. Kaley is the only real family that I have left. I have an idea. Get up. Get in. Get in, or we will start dropping you. You're lucky she's giving you a way out. Am I? I'm sending them to a negative dimension. Who knows what's out there? Good. Now get in. You have five seconds. Five, four, three, two, one. Come on. Wow. Okay. That was pretty impressive, uh, negative dimensions? Hey, thanks, you were pretty impressive, too. Although, "Get in, or we'll start dropping you"? You've got to work on your lines, man. Not my best badass-erie, but it worked, didn't it? Hey, it did. Hey, we make a pretty good team. Okay, give me your gun. What? No. Mark, come on, we can't be walking around with guns. -There's windows everywhere. -Okay. Okay. Oh, no. The portal. Claire, Peter, did you find Feregamo? Yeah, let's go to the hospital and-- -Michelle's here. -What? Long story, let's not waste any time. Wait, where are Palmer's guys? -We got rid of them. -What do you mean? We took control of the situation. I sent them to a negative dimension. Huh, I'm impressed. What the hell happened to you? Long story. Time's ticking, guys, come on. Surprise assholes. Thanks for knocking me out. But you should have killed me when you had the chance. Now, let's get down to business, shall we? The Interface, hand it over. Don't do it, Claire. Mom's life depends on it. So do ours. It doesn't matter anyways. The fuck? What happened to the portal? What did you do? Nothing. It-- it doesn't stay open for long. My sister can open it for you. Then what are you waiting for? Turn that shit back on. Come on! Any last words? I don't have time for you to make a will or anything. What the fuck? Whoa, that was neat. But we did it better. I think I shit myself. -Where did you send him? -To a negative dimension. That was awesome. Michelle's waiting upstairs, come on. Okay. This is the moment she saw in her vision. This moment right here. Incredible. Shit! What's happening? - Hey, we gotta take it off. - Hey, No, no, no! -No. No. -God-- God, get out of my way! You need to calm down. I already lost my father because of you, if anything happens, I swear to God- You never told them about us, did you? You shouldn't have shown up like this. You could have destroyed my family We're your family, too. You don't recognize me? Mom. Is everything okay? Mom. That girl, Claire. You know her, don't you? What's the matter? Where's your mother? She's in there. Honey, is everything okay? Honey? I have something to tell you. Both of you. You said you were gonna stop drinking. You're gonna do this again? Yes, I am going to do this again. You know what happens when you drink. This is ridiculous, you know if you were happy-- I can drink whatever the fuck I want. No, no you can't drink whatever you want. You can't drink whenever you want. -You know what happens-- -Well, you sound like a fucking broken record, woman. Well, maybe that's what you need to hear -it over and over again-- -Shut the fuck up, or I'm gonna nail you again, just like yesterday. - In case you haven't learned. - You promised. You promised you wouldn't bring work home anymore. Do I have a choice? Yes, you do have a choice. The girls-- Do you think I enjoy sitting at that recital by myself comforting a crying child? - This is ridiculous. - Oh, shut the fuck up. - You promised! - Shut up! And there's more where that came from. Honey, I'm home. It's gonna be okay. Shit. This could be Palmer. It's not him. Looks like it could be a cop. Stay here. I'll handle this. Can I help you, Officer? Yes, is this the Hopkins residence? Mm-hmm. We got a call from the Good Samaritan Hospital informing us that a patient, Michelle Hopkins, is missing. What do you mean she's missing? My mother's in a coma and last time I checked people in comas don't just go missing. Is your mother here? Excuse me? That wheelchair has a Good Samaritan logo on it. So? Videotape shows someone taking her out of the hospital in a wheelchair. Can I come in? Do you have a warrant? I'm gonna need you to step aside. My sister is getting dressed. I'll go get her. You let the cop in? Really? I couldn't stop him, he suspects something's up. You have to stop him from coming up here no matter what, because if he does, this little experiment of ours is over. Okay, I can't stop a fucking cop from coming in here-- You need to buy them some time. I have a plan,. - What? What? Shit. - He's coming up. -He's coming. -All right, do you trust me? No! Sure. Whatever. You stay there and make sure that the cop does not see you no matter what. What the hell are you doing? It is a hostage situation, okay? I need you to play along and I need you to trust me so we can get out of this mess. Okay. Drop the gun now, and let her go. In case you haven't noticed, I am the one with the hostage. You have five seconds to get the hell away from this house, or I will slaughter her and her entire family. Okay. Okay, don't do anything stupid. See? I'm doing what you said. I'm leaving. Okay? If I see you, or any other cop anywhere near this house... -you got it? -Uh-huh. I gotcha. What the hell is wrong with you? Do you know what kind of mess you just created? This place is gonna be crawling with cops in no time! Calm down, okay? I'm doing this to help. We're all going to jail when this is over. That is if the snipers don't take us out first, I will be going to jail. Not you, and stay away from the fucking windows. Who are you? Oh, God, what is happening to me? You are a foreign object in this space. You think you can mess around in someone's mind and their system won't fight back? What are you? Your fear. Michelle? Michelle, it's Claire. - Wake up. - Claire. - What-- what are you-- Where-- - You had a seizure. You went into a coma, your kidneys are failing. Where's your sister? Michelle, you're still in a coma. How am I talking to you then? We're both connected to a machine that's allowing us to communicate on a subconscious level. I'm literally in your head. We're running out of time, Michelle, you have to wake up. I am so tired of fighting, Claire. No, Michelle. Don't give up on us. Not now. I'm here to help you. I think I know why you're still in a coma. I know what Dad did to you. You were not supposed to know about that. Your father was in a very dark place for a while. Don't you dare defend him. Look at what he did to you. Your emotional scars are all over the place. You don't understand. Your father was a good man. The only reason why your mind is trapped here is because of him. To wake up, you have to face your demons. Believe it or not, he is your demon. He is the root of all of your pain. You left us, because you were depressed and you wanted to get better. But you never came back after you got better, because deep down you were still afraid of him. That's not true. -That's not true. -You know it's true. Your being here in Neil's house proves that. He made you feel safe. In order for you to wake up, you have to take us back to our house. You have to face him. He can't hurt you anymore. You can do it. Just imagine that we are at our house. Yes. You can fight him, Michelle. This again? I have to get this done! Michelle. -Michelle, what is it? -He's here. Michelle, listen to me. He's-- he's not here. -He's dead. -He's inside. This is just your mind projecting him. -No, he's here. -It's your imagination latching onto your darkest fear. -He's inside. -He's not. Michelle, listen to me. Sit down. My name is Stanley Jacobson, I'm a hostage negotiator with the LAPD. Are the hostages safe? -Uh-- -You are a strong woman. You can fight this. Don't be afraid. Just close your eyes and shut him out. Now, concentrate on my voice and mine alone. We love you. We love you and we are here to help you. Now, stay with my voice. Just follow my voice. This again? I have things to do! Just like yesterday! This is ridiculous, you promised me you wouldn't be bringing this home. Uh, yeah, they're great. I don't understand. It should have worked. I'll call you right back. It's okay, guys. We did our best. Okay, you guys have to go. - Are you sure? - Yes, go. Let's go, go, go. She's not breathing. - What? - One, two, three. One, two, three. Michelle? Michelle? Please do the CPR, do the CPR, she's not breathing. She's not breathing! Police! We need some help, can I get some help? Please! she's not breathing! She's not breathing. Get that gun out of my face. She's dying. They're gone. Claire. What are you doing here? This should help... with your project. And I also wanted to apologize... for what I put your family through. It's okay, Claire. I would have done the same for my family. Still, it was wrong. I shouldn't have done it. It's okay. Really. For what it's worth, you saved my family, too. And I appreciate you bringing me this. Bye. Hello? Really? That's great. I'm heading home now. I'll tell her the good news. I've decided to turn myself in... for what I did to your father. Are you serious? We weren't gonna press charges. -We knew it was an accident. -I know. But it's the right thing to do. I mean, we all know it. I-- I may be a coward, but... at least I can own up to that. I forgive you. Just so you know. Thanks. I really appreciate that. I was hoping we could talk when you got a minute. About? Everything. - I think-- - It's okay. You made a mistake. It's okay to make mistakes. No one is perfect. I had to learn the hard way. Well, and about the surgery? Are you sure you want to do this? You don't have to go through with this. You don't owe me anything. I want to. Oh, you're so slow! Are you sure you're my half-sister? Whatever, you cheated. So... what's next? Well, Mom's gonna go back to Georgia after surgery. Just gonna be us in this big old house. I say we sell it and we move to Georgia. That is an excellent idea! You should move in with us. Of course! As tempting as that sounds... this is our home. We grew up here. Yep. I say we... stay here... keep the house... and Mom and Tess can visit whenever they want. What? I don't think I've ever heard you refer to or call her Mom... like, ever. -For as long as I can remember. -Shut up. It's so obvious you three are related.
