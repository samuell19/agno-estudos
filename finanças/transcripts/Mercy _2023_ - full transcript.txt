In court, the judges slowed their breathing, swallowed, bowed their heads and put their hands to their mouths as they viewed the footage, all of it caught on film. It was a long fight for it to be allowed as evidence. Eventually... it was. A custodial sentence of six weeks was given, so the convicted served just three and received a ban from working in this profession again. They didn’t blink. The abattoir received no punishment. I remember being born. I do. I remember being slushed out onto cold concrete, and mum lying there behind iron bars. She couldn’t move. She tried. No one came to help. I can’t imagine how it was for her. She was warm and I lay there drinking up her bravery, her endurance. It was hers and I sucked it from her. I was lucky, my neediness for her saved me. It was dark, cold, wet. As she lay there, I showed her my little scampers around the floor, when care was not yet mine, and her big eye would look at me, like a moon. She would sing to me, the song that meant all is well. My brothers and sisters... I don't know where they are now. Some stayed with us. Then a worker in boots came and picked up one of the the others, he’d been so small and pale. Maybe they were playing. Held him by the back legs and swung him up in the air. Threw him. The concrete thudded. Pound Against Concrete. P.A.C. One fell asleep. I tried to wake him... but he never did. They say pigs can't cry. Mum did. Long streams from her eyes. Her whole time on this earth she had lain there... having life put into her by a metal pipe, bearing life, giving life. It was on my third day into life, the first thing happened. My third day of dancing and running around, gazed on by her eyes of glazed love. A man came with his boots and lifted me… high from sleep and warmth and home... and cut my teeth... and cut off my tail. I screamed... my silvery squeal cauterizing my little body, jabbed with antibiotic injection… When the shock wore off... I was sore tailed and sore toothed. Head, jaw, ears, tail... a throbbing ache. Something in my chest ached… Body bleeding. Castrated. Mutilated. Injected. This is now. This is here. This is me. Such a short while I stayed bathing in her sweet light... Though she was squeezed in tight... but I lay by her nose and slept by her brow… My mother. My Mother. Together in our darkened home… caring not, for what we didn’t have... grateful and growing only in our bonds and family unit... strange... unnatural and utterly perfect. Soon we were taken. Too soon taken... Too young taken, stolen from her. Three weeks is too soon. She tried to stand to resist, but couldn’t rise from her entombment, craned her neck and eyes to look at us, as we were herded away to another place… and gates were locked... and others like me stood stunned, wide-eyed and pale. I cry out but no-one hears, and my cry merges with a sea of cries. Our dream with her, was over. We now only have each other and the dark. I work in an abattoir. I'm an abattoir worker. ONE is an abattoir worker. Slaughterhouse to you. Got it. You got a problem wiv that? Cos I wanna be straight wiv ya.. Right from the off. Alright. 'Cos I get a bit of stick from people nowadays. Wot wiv the Internet. And this. And that. It’s a family business. I grew up in it. But it ain’t pretty. It ain’t pretty at all. Well, what d’ya expect it to be, sweet and nice as pie? And that. Come on then sweetheart... come on my pretty little pink poppet... that's right... come to papa... so papa can... Keep still... you little... wriggler. KEEP. Pigging. STILL. Ahhh we’ve got a dancer!!! Yeeehahhhhh!!! Yeeehaahhh! Dance for Daddy! Dance for Daddy! Look. I've got a job to do. I've got a family to feed. So why don’t you just bog right back off to where you come from, you know, sitting there, looking at me, judging me. So. Some of you must like a bit of meat? Come on.. Own up. Some of you must be partial to a bacon sarnie? Unless you’re one of those, what they’re called, err... Vegans. Morons more like. They don't know what life is all about. Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! Oh, you see what I mean? I’ve got another, load comin' in soon, so I can’t stand around wiv you all day ‘avin a muvvers’… so…I’m gonna go and ‘av my tea break… Erm... I might have a nice bit o’ sausage roll... de do dah day. I gotta keep me strengf up ‘en all! So… I'll see you lot later. I can’t believe I’m doing this. But well. Here I am, apparently. Me in my nice shoes and peach scarf with lots of… well… Demonstrators. I saw this event on Facebook, “Come along and see the animals go into a slaughter house... Talk to them. Give them some good energy before they die and see if it changes your mind”. I mean... Woo Hooo!! I can honestly think of better things to do. I mean it’s not my cause, but now I’ve been tagged, I feel like I have to come. “it’s only down the road.” So... here we all are... I never even knew it was here. Long lonely lane in the middle of nowhere. Bit of an eye-opener really. It’s not something I’ve ever thought a lot about, what with everything else going on. I mean, it’s nature, isn’t it, eating meat? It’s just what we do. It’s a job, innit. Listen to that… I didn’t think you’d be able to hear them! Toot for the pigs. Toot for the pigs. It’s in vogue at the moment and I’m constantly having to change the subject, because they really do go on. Just stop!!! Please! But eating meat... it's just what you do, it’s just the way it is. To be honest, I can’t stop here long, I’ve… I’ve got so much on today. So... I just hope this is going to be brief. It's my first day. Day one. Nervous. I don't want to mess up. Don’t want to mess it up. There were no other jobs for me. I tried. This was all. So... I find myself in an abattoir. A slaughterhouse. Here I am. Come on my little porky darling... come on my little porky princess… that’s a good girl, there we go. Yes, my son! Ohhh yes. You little porker. I never saw her again. I was three weeks old. I wasn't meant to be weaned yet, it was too soon. Incarcerated in a concrete pen with the others... so many of us... no space... there were fights... there was constant boredom… And while I grew and was fattened, she was impregnated again... her loss filled once more with life. And so it was, that my short time on Earth was being rounded up... injected with antibiotics and drugs. Kept in this dark squalor. Nothing to do. Some didn't make it. Then one day… The final day… The lorries came. I was five months old. Suddenly the big doors opened, and a gush of sweet, clean air rushed in where before was only dark and dirt. A bright blue blaze of daylight. My eyes blinked. All our noses rose above our heads... a phenomenon was before us. Something was different. Something stilled us from our numbed oblivion, lifted us up with a hopeful scent. The outside. The world. The unknown... from which we had been imprisoned since the moment consciousness entered our tiny bodies. The men came in their boots with their bats, each day to give us food and water... but today as yesterday... no food... I was hungry and hopeful. Perhaps at last we were going from this place… to a better place... The men came in. The gates of our pens opened. The glee of something wild and calling, rushed into my blood. Something wild, open and free, beckoned my feet, grateful of movement, of change, of oxygen. Daylight. Outside. And I ran with the others. Out. Out. Out. We ran and ran, and they herded us with bats and I didn’t care, for there it was, the day! The sky, blue! Blue! and the bright white light of air and cloud and sun, hot on my skin. Thirsty for it, soaking it up. I jumped jumps of joy. I had forgotten the joy of being… But now here and out, I felt the touch of hope.. The touch of some great spirit, all embracing and uplifting. I took in a long, long gulp of this sweet day, and suddenly as soon as out... we're in... and a drawbridge came up on my escape, and I was captive once more. An engine started... there was vibration… engine moan... shunting movement... fuel smoke... and I tried to keep my balance as it jerked, lurched forward and we all squashed... a sea of us... so tight together now, as the world ran by us. I looked back and saw the sheds where I had spent my first days… grow smaller and smaller, and a roar of engine labouring at our weight... three tiers high of all my kind… with bars through which we looked. My primal self was called and I watched as the world spun past, blurring close and mesmerising far... wondrous, warm, abundant, life. Thank you to everyone who has travelled here today to bear witness. We have invited you to witness that today, 850 non-human people will be murdered here. This may be distressing for you to see and hear, but please know that your presence will not be in vain. Although we cannot halt this mass execution, we can give kindness, comfort and compassion to those who have known none. Ultimately we need to close them down, but until then, we need to ensure that every slaughterhouse and factory farm has mandatory, independently monitored CCTV, so that the animals can no longer be abused... behind closed doors! We call upon this slaughterhouse NOW... to put down their weapons of mass destruction and make the connection. We all implore you... to look into their eyes… Are you all gonna be here long? Are you gonna be staying here long? ‘Just wanna keep you safe this morning so please just keep to the footpaths...' A lot of lorries… No standing in the road… Are you going to do anything about what’s going on in there? I’m obviously impartial.. Obviously impartial… Keep it clean! Is it OK for them to murder pigs, then? They’re trying to run a business... Trying to run a business... Yeah, they’re trying to run a business that kills! What about all the murders that are going on in there? Just remember they are trying to run a business, so don’t block the highway and no swearing... that is obviously the important thing. ...innocent natures, who have known nothing but man’s greed and man’s indifference... You all have your right to protest… You have every right for a peaceful protest… but keep it clean... all right? …born only to die! The most vulnerable creatures on earth… Born in confinement... raised in squalor... We’ll be going to have a word with the owner later... Going in to have a chat with the owner. Sentenced to death between three and six months old... not allowed to roam freely in the fields... So… no one wants to, er, talk to us today? …to make a nest, in which to bear and nurture their young… kept in confinement… Wot’s goin' on ‘ere… look at these guys… idiots… - Bunch o’ wallies! - Waste o’ time… - Look at the state o’ ya… - Caused a traffic jam! Look at the state of you!!! We just been stuck in traffic 'cos o’ you lot... Hang on a minute… She’s wearing leather shoes! Look! - No… excuse me… - Yes, you are! Go and get a job! Excuse me... they’re vegan and we all have got jobs. - Vegan?! - Yeah. Wot’s Vegan then? No meat. No animals… You're nuts, the lot of ya! I tell ya! - Yes, you are! - No… wait... - Causing traffic congestion.. - Yeah... get yerself a job! See ya later, then. What’s she doin' wearin' levva shoes then... if you... They’re not leather... they’re vegan... - Bye, bye. - Car coming. Don’t drive off... - Stop wasting time. - Yeah, go and get yerself a proper job... Gonna have a nice bacon sandwich. - Oi! - Its you that’s wasting time, you dick. Shame on you, Scum, Animal abusers, Shame on you. Scum, Scum, Animal abusers, SHAME ON YOU! Stop! Stop! Shame on you! SHAME ON YOU! SHAME ON YOU! SCUM! MURDERER! Pigs rank number four in animal intelligence, behind chimpanzees, dolphins and elephants. They’re more intelligent than dogs, yet if dogs were treated the way pigs were treated in the U.K, The farmers and slaughterers would be in prison, but because there are virtually no laws protecting pigs, their ill treatment is ‘legal’ and the farmers and slaughter men are making profit. Philip Lymbery of Compassion in World Farming says. “The viral hot-house of keeping animals... caged, cramped and confined are conditions that allow viruses to mutate.” The United Nations said, “A global shift towards a vegan diet is vital to save the world from hunger, fuel poverty and the worst impacts of climate change.” I feel a bit hot… I get her point and everything, but we’ve been eating meat for a long time, and what would happen to all the pigs and cows and chickens if we didn’t breed them... they’d all become extinct. I mean the way animals are raised in intensive farming is a horrible thing, I agree. I don’t know.. My husband died when he was fifty. His heart. High cholesterol. But, that’s genetic, isn’t it… They say that you can reverse medical conditions by what you eat... but… I mean no one would be sick if that was the case, would they… we’d all be eating plants if that was the case… I mean… if he’d eaten differently it wouldn’t necessarily… We are brainwashed by the aggressive marketing of the animal agricultural industry. The United Nations state that Animal Agriculture is one of the major causes of climate change and the Eco Disaster. It’s reversible by humans adopting a plant-based vegan diet. What are we waiting for? We have to act now! Juliet Gellatley, founder and director of Viva!, said, “Three quarters of the world’s new and emerging infectious diseases come from animals, mainly from trading in wild life or from factory farming. Covid 19, SARS, MERS, Bird Flu, Ebola and AIDS to name but a few, are some zoonotic diseases which come from the exploitation and consumption of animals. Fifty-six zoonotic diseases are responsible for an estimated 2.5 billion cases of human illness, and 2.7 million deaths a year. Veganism is not being acknowledged as a key preventative measure for future outbreaks by any government or health organisation, because too much money is made from and invested into the animal agricultural industry. We ALL have the power to change our future by protecting our planet and ALL of its inhabitants... human and non-human. The simplest, most economical and effective solution, is to end the global trade in wild animals, and to stop eating animals.” Thank you for stepping outside of your comfort zones today, to be here with them... for them. Soon the lorries will come. Be safe. And when the lorries stop... feel free to talk softly to those on board who are bound for un-peaceful deaths... which ALL will resist... none will go freely... and as we stand here together, briefly... with them... we are saying, ‘We see you, we are trying and we’re sorry.’ The smell hits me... it’s intense... it’s unearthly. Move away from the lorry please. I peer through into the gloom. Haaaa... so many… still. Covered in bruises… scratches. Their eyes look at me... inquisitive. They raise their noses. I’m worried about stroking them. Do pigs bite? I remember being born… I do. One of them is looking at me... right near the bar... an almost human eye… "Hello”. Looks back at me... as if wondering… seems to know that I am speaking to him. Or her. “Hello.” Hot, cold, tired, hungry, thirsty... Crammed in so tight... We’ve stopped suddenly. There are different human faces. Faces and words that seem... Kind. And sad. Hands touching us gently, for the first time. EVER. Soft, gentle hands with a tenderness. I remember only once… from my mother. But no other. Except this gentle human soul, who looks at me with some unconscious thought rising in her eyes, and in her eyes I see reflected, my own unconscious dread. I feel myself aware that I want to help. “I want to help”. I look at this… being… in front of me.. Just present. Present with me. “It”... becomes “Him” or “Her”... “You.” I’ve said it. “You.” Now I’m damned. Now I’ve recognised. Made… the… connection. “You…" are at... our... mercy. Have I just named you? I’m aware that I can’t seem to comprehend what I’m doing or seeing. I hear someone speak softly. “I’m sorry." “I’m sorry." And then I realise it’s me. The drivers are getting angry… more police are here now… someone is being led away for giving the pigs water… You… look at me… I have to stand away as the truck moves off, and I watch you go... trapped inside… all of you, and it’s my fault. I’m responsible. I’m the consumer paying them to do my dirty work... that could endanger us all. I like to move it move it... Move it! The lorry jerked finally to a halt. It was a bad place. I heard the screams of a thousand sisters. I smelt the blood of a billion brothers. The evening was coming. Get in there! NOW! Move it! Get in there now! Get in there now! Get in. Go. Get in there now! Get in there, now! Eughhh! Get in there now! Get in! Wot’ve we got ‘ere?!? Little piggy eh? Now! Get up! Eughhh! C’mon!!! Oi! Get a move on! Oi! Get up! Oh, about time… Wot’s so funny?! Here comes Johnny Reggae, Here comes Johnny. Reggae Reggae, Johnny Reggae Reggae... Lay it on me... - Fuck off! - Oooh hooo! Wot? Ohhh, bless… Now listen boys and girls, a little bit of work won’t go amiss... Tosser! We’ve got a load in. Pull yer socks up. For fuck’s sake. Wot? Fuckin’ 'ell. I sicken… pull myself into a crevice. It's just me and them now. I can't get away... Nice shot. Mug. - Go on - Hit it! Wot, like this you mug? You missed! Euh... Come on, you mug. Your pissing on my boots... you fucking melt! Ughhh sick! Didn’t ya know? Your the melt you fucking prick. Fucking mug, pissing on my boots! Come on! Stop… please stop... Come on! - STOP! Please stop! Stop, please! - Only got a couple of pricks... COME ON! OH. COME. ON! Please stop kicking me, you’re hurting me! Mine was not the usual run of the mill job interview. "I would like you to skin this sheep". They were very pleased with me. I am thorough and precise. The training was short. The herding. The stun. The kill. The hanging. The drawing. The quartering. The rutting. The mess. The smell. The gore. I knew I would need to keep hosing. Keep it as clean as I can make it. Some of the others work dirty. This morning I put on my hard head. I'm not a hard man. Have to get this right, I'm in love. Have to get this right, Don’t want suffering, no other voices talk this way, Keep my thoughts to myself, shown how to kill, Full of sound and fury, unrelenting, Do you know, death has a smell, Sweet, sickly sweet, Hyacinths. Summer wasps swarm around like flies. Sweet, sickly sweet, Hyacinths. Hyacinths. When the transporters come... echoing silence is shattered by an unearthly porcine chorus. Swine scream. They always do. They set each other off. But this time it's different. This time, the men are making it worse. Even I can hear that. They’re goading them to upset the protesters outside. They’ve been coming here a long time now. Every week... since the leak. I heard about that. But I keep that to myself. I know what they get up to in here. I know. I see. The pigs stampede off just to get some movement. But after that, they freeze. They just seem doped. They can smell death in the air. They're animals. They live on their senses. But it’s not my job to think that. The workers bash their bats around. The pigs are covered in great big red weals and welts of bruises. Looks as if they’ve been smacked with red paint powder at a Holi festival. The process is so quick… Usually. It’s high-pressured. Stressful. On everyone. The workers to get it done. The animals to maintain life. At any cost. They buck and rear and run. They’re anxious. Panic-stricken. You’ll be busy at work and you'll look round at the line and you'll see some of them have just dropped stone dead. Their hearts just stop. From the stress. They know. They know. How could they not? The noise and smell is dreadful. They go dashing about the walls in a desperate attempt to escape. Some of them are sick, have broken bones, they can’t run. I pity them the most. I’ve seen them dragged. Thrown by their ears, prodded with electric prongs brutally, over and over just to make them move. Group mentality, mob mentality, Worlds away from me, no other voices talk my way. Keep my thoughts to myself, Oi mate, where you been, we been looking for ya, Fucking mug! Full of sound and fury, un-consenting. We are all, entering hell. Sweet, sickly sweet, Hyacinths. And the summer wasps swarm around like flies, Sweet, sickly sweet, Hyacinths, Hyacinths, Hyacinths, Hyacinths... The next panics in pushed sliding on the gore, More difficult to catch, six months’ old, Eyes wide, mouth gaping, panicking, trafficking, This is the fight man’s rigged to win, Man wrestles beast, is this the lure? The primal war, Blood... lust... up! He fights to live... his right to live, Man's rigged to win, it’s a computer game to him, Animals are victims to our hunger and our salary, It’s not a fair fight but stimulates adrenalin, Stimulates the primal win, Privately annihilating kill by kill, Privately annihilating kill by kill, Kill by kill, kill by kill, Want out but I’m in, Sold out now I'm in, Kill by kill by kill by kill, Sold my soul, Sold my soul, soul my soul. Man don’t care, fists punch the air, Sold my soul, sold my soul, sold my soul, Kill by kill, kill by kill, kill by kill, Sold my soul, sold my soul, sold my soul, Sold my soul, Sold my soul, sold my soul, sold my soul... Sold his soul, sold his soul, sold his soul... Industrious, you’re so industrious, You build your gravestone high, and fuck the rest of us, And business boy, what a busy jerk you are, The power to destroy, is so illustrious, Impressive pile, you make the devil smile, You kiss his lips, but you’re just dust to us, Curious, I am curious, When I look inside of me I always see you there, Curious, I am curious, When I look inside of me, I see you there, Industrious, you’re so industrious. You screw the bolts in tight, and bottle up the pus, And business boy, what a creep you really are, You dig us all in deep, you think you’re bloody marvelous, Conclusive wealth, the devil’s in good health, You feed him up… genius, Curious, I am curious, When I look inside of me, I always see you there, Curious, I am curious, When I look inside of me, I see you there, NEXT! There's only a few of us now. One of the men comes... shouting... with a bat... he smells sweet… of hyacinths... maybe she left me some... the beautiful one who came to me... He's so mad at me, he won't stop, he's so mad at us… he's in a hurry… his mortgage is late... They’re short-staffed. The workers they have are no good... his wife hates him… wants to leave... he's moody… never talks… doesn't touch her... just drinks and watches the TV… He's very stressed, his blood pressure’s high, his life’s meaningless, he has to carry on... if he stopped he'd have to think… he's trying not to think… he dare not think... he's on the edge, he's had enough of his torment… he's going to take it all… out... on... me… He rains down on me... all the blows he's ever had, all the indifference in his life... in this one moment... rains it... all... down on me, blow after blow after blow... over and over and over, thirty-six blows to my head and back in less than a minute... I just don't want to go in there, that's all... please don't make me… I don't want to die... GET A BLOODY MOVE ON! Please don't kill me... it hurts, that's all, please don't hurt me, please, Please don't hurt me... please... please... please... It’s my turn. My first day at this. Forgive me for being afraid. Forgive me for not knowing where to go and when… forgive me for making it difficult for you. I don't want to die. I've never done it before. Forgive me for being afraid. It’ll be better to be dead for me than this life, but I don't know that yet and I only want to live. Forgive me for making it hard for you... I'm sorry. Forgive me. It's my first time. Please don't hurt me anymore. I only have a short time left. A minute. Maybe two. I haven't eaten for days. I’m weak… so scared. Forgive me for making your life so hard. I don't know how not to be afraid I can’t help wanting to live... forgive me… In one comes, racing, bolting, panic-stricken. The cage door slams shut. It’s just him and me now. I pick up the tongs. My hands are clammy and cold. My face is hot. I try to corner him. Terror darts his eyes and the scream hurts the drums of my ears as if they would burst. I aim the tongs at his head. His fight for life is so admirable that my fight to do my job rises. I’m sweating, nauseous with effort. I have to be quick. Tongs. To head. Contact. Trigger. Shock. He pulls back, partial shock. I don't know where I got him... the face, but not the brain. He staggers, runs, jerking, tripping, my panic rises with his, I have to stamp him out, stamp out his terror and confusion, stamp out his pain, and, along with it, mine. I come in again, Position! Contact! Trigger! Shock! I feel power race through me as if I am Zeus... Lightning courses through my veins and out of my hands, and bolts straight into his brain. I feel it that time. The Stun. The power surges as he drops heavy as if shot. I stand above my kill as though a matador, triumphant in the bull ring, taking applause from a rapturous bloodthirsty invisible crowd… I soar from the precipice of self... into a sky of elation... with wide wings circling around the universe as if it were mine. As if it were mine. And slowly, on rapturous curtain calls of sound, down and down, I glide... While hands, seemingly not mine… pick up the knife. The blade looms larger than the world before my face, and in it, I catch my reflection and my pallor. I bring the blade to rest, on the soft spot of the neck. Slowly I stroke the soft silk throat with razor blade, deep red blood cascades… a roll of red silk erupting operatically from the shining black wound... flooding the floor like a deep shining red aura… surrounding me with a macabre lake, on which I seem to skate in my new white boots, that absorb the stain like shroud. I watch as he struggles to breathe. Drowning. Gasping, and bleeding… Pupil still registering. Still alive. We share a look. Something draws me deeply in... as an astronaut in space is drawn to gaze back down upon Earth. In the bright and beautiful glistening globe, I am suspended, in a dark abyss. I feel our being locked in. As life fades… something of me is taken... and what is left of me... stays until the end. ‘Thine is the task of blood. Discharge thy task with mercy. Let thy victim feel no pain. Let sudden blow bring death; Such death as thou thyself would ask for.’ It was all so fast. So furious. My adrenaline raced and lifted me out of myself. I saw the tongs come to my head. I can't remember pain now. Maybe death is like birth. I smile because I’m free. He slit my throat and my blood flew from me, a hot red flag. He stayed with me while I died. I was grateful not to be alone. He had kind eyes. His eyes witnessed my death, as others had witnessed my short life. Bred for food. Born to be killed. All of us. So many of us. We share the planet you and I and merely by the simple fluke of... chance... we’re born to be those who’ll be cherished, or born to be those who’ll be abused. When you walk away from my story... remember me. He hung me to half mast, and enchanted, I fly, ethereal voices singing me to merciful nothing. I’d had enough of it anyway. I’d become a murderer, in a murdering job. Meat and Dairy: The more you eat, the more you want. It’s a mugs game, and it’s dying. I can see, all them slaughterhouses becoming ‘Plant Production Facilities’. Plant Plants! No-one would have to lose their jobs, and it would be a lot more peaceful, and cleaner. I’d be able to sleep at night. Through the bars of the truck the world goes by, Through the bars of the truck I see the sky, I cry mercy, mercy, mercy, mercy, Through the bars of the truck you see my eye, Through the bars of the truck I see you cry, - Yee-ha! Yee-ha! - For mercy, for mercy, for mercy, for mercy, Through the bars of the truck we say goodbye, Through the bars of the truck I’m scared to die, They show no mercy, no mercy, no mercy, no mercy, No mercy, No mercy. No mercy, No mercy, No mercy, No mercy. Your honour, the animals are not the only victims. The cold hard truth is that the workers are not encouraged to see the animals as alive, independent, thinking, feeling beings but to disassociate from them and their feelings, which has its own dire consequences for them as humans. As the animals are driven off the trucks, the workers must see them as pieces of meat, to be killed as quickly and efficiently as possible, on the highly pressurised assembly line... the... disassembly line. There are many shocking practices, in factory farms and slaughterhouses that are standard and legal, to which the workers have to develop immunity in order to do their laborious and stressful jobs. PTSD, trauma, anxiety and other mental health issues go largely undocumented, and many are trapped in this line of work through lack of choice, and become themselves, victims, in the animal agricultural industry’s powerful, secret and hidden world. Philip Lymbery, from Compassion in World Farming, says that the caged, crammed and confined conditions of factory farms, provide the ideal breeding ground for new and more deadly strains of virus. Swine flu and highly pathogenic avian flu, being but two examples. At the same time, the global desire for ever more meat, means clearing more forest worldwide for farm land, encroaching on wild lands and their novel viruses. In short, our treatment of animals in the natural world, risks new and deadly disease pandemics.
