(COW MOOS) (LOUD CHEERING) (WOMAN SINGS 'AVE MARIA') COMMENTATOR: What's the humiliation? A lot of unhappiness around the BernabÂeu tonight. A lot of it directed at Gavin Harris. Came out as a hero. He's being called a donkey tonight. Ronaldinho seals it with a brilliant third. Boy, do they need some inspiration from somewhere. COMMENTATOR: (ON TV) And now it's MuÄnez. And we haven't seen too much of him today. Trying a...give-and-go here with Alan Shearer. What a great run by MuÄnez! Unbelievable. Newcastle's newest and youngest player gives the fans a brand-new song to sing. He's got support to his right. Stephen Carr. A great header! And a goal! It's a dream start for Newcastle! -OK. -(HORN BEEPS) MAN: What did you want to do about the rose petals? About bloody time. Well, can we have the red rose petals, but in that... -Look, I've gotta get back to work. -Hey, babe. -OK. Hello. -Hey. -Hiya. -Just... MAN: Listen, darling, I've gotta go, but I will speak to you later. -WOMAN: Alright. 'Bye. -MAN: Bye-bye. San, it's 4:50. The meeting with the wedding planner was at 4:00. Sorry, babe, I just... I lost track of time. Come on, we're supposed to do this stuff together. Yeah, but what do I know about the colour of the flowers? As long as you show up, I'll be happy. You Latin boys are so bloody cheeky, do you know that? -Are you gonna show up? -I might. I might. If you're lucky. -(LAUGHS) -Ooh, no. Go and have a shower. You stink. It's time for a toast, I think. Here's to your new home. And may all your ups and downs be in the bedroom. -Mam! -(ALL LAUGH) You might wanna be careful there, though, Santi. Look where it got me. You should be so lucky I let you get near me. -How about extra-hot vindaloo? -MOTHER: No! Have a bit of consideration - I'm the one who has to sleep with him. It sounds good! -Hello, stranger. -MAN: Hello. What happened - did you lose me number or something? That's good timing, we're just ordering. No, no. Can I have a quick word? -Yeah, sure. -In private. -OK. -Excuse us. Oh, my God. I've been on the phone for hours. Are they serious? They wanna meet us. Hmm. (BOTH LAUGH) -Schtum, though, OK? -Yeah. And you've still got two more years with Newcastle. You're not leaving Newcastle. The fans will go mad. You're the best player they've got. They haven't offered me anything. It's just a meeting. So, when are they coming to meet us? They're not. I'm meeting them in Japan. ('I'M TURNING JAPANESE' PLAYS) # Because I'm turning, I'm turning, I'm turning, I'm turning # I'm turning Japanese I think I'm turning Japanese # I really think so # I'm turning Japanese I think I'm turning Japanese # I really think so # I'm turning Japanese I think I'm turning Japanese # I really think so # I'm turning Japanese I think I'm turning Japanese # I really think so. # The biggest football club on the planet.

Welcome to this legendary football club. I wanted to introduce you to our coach. Van der Merwe. Pleased to meet you, sir. Sorry you had to come so fast. That's fine. We want Santiago. We can make this work. But we have to act quickly. The transfer window closes tomorrow at midnight. -I know. -OK. Let's vamoose, hey? Come on. (TECHNO MUSIC PLAYS) Just don't think about the money, you know? Ah, you're gonna hate Madrid - they all speak bloody Spanish. -How's it going? -Good, mate. -We haven't said yes yet. -What are you, mad? With your 10%, you could have your chest waxed, some blond highlights, you'll be sorted. It's a big decision, man. Roz and I just got this great new house. You came halfway around the world for a night of karaoke? No-one says no to Real Madrid. -You nutter! -No. But I don't wanna spend a season on the bench like Owen, one of the best. I'd go crazy. (SPEAKS DUTCH) -He's Dutch. -Gentlemen. Herr Van der Merwe, can I get you a drink? Thank you. You're not giving any career advice, are you? No, he's just pretending he's got a decision to make. I have some advice. First, you listen to your heart. Then you listen to your head. And then your wife will tell you what to do. (ALL LAUGH) -You're OK, Mr Ives. -(MOBILE RINGS) Sorry, Doctor. ALL: Santi! (Reporters fire questions) No comment! Santi, don't leave! WOMAN: (ON TV) And Michael Owen acknowledges the Newcastle fans as they welcome him to St James's Park. The last-minute exchange deal with Real Madrid will see Santiago MuÄnez move to Real Madrid on a 2-year contract. Uh, excuse me. You know where Roz is? -Yeah, just down to the left. -Thank you. Oh, there's that git, upsetting my lovely Rosalind. You're in the bad books now, you know? Hey, you save your breath, Mr Ives. -(SOFTLY) Baby. -I don't want to talk to you. -Baby, I tried to call you. -Not here. -You should've asked for more time. -I tried, Roz. Hey, listen. I love you. I love you and I want to marry you. None of that changes. But right now, before we have kids and responsibilities, we can go... Would you stop playing with the bed? ROZ: I'm sorry. We can go places, do things, just you and me. Hmm? (SIGHS) I'm not sure I wanna live in Spain. -I mean... San, I love Newcastle. -I love it too. This town's been good to me. If I hadn't come here, I wouldn't have found the most important thing in my life - you. He's got a point there, you know. Yeah, and what about our wedding and our lovely new house and my job? -I love my job. -I know. But... I've got exams at Easter. You can come and see me on your days off. How's that? I'll fly back when I can. Baby, I can't walk away from this chance. This is my life, and I want you there...with me. -I can't even speak Spanish. -I'll teach you. I'm not eating paella. Hey, hey, hey. Come...come here. Will you do us a favour? When you see that Gavin Harris, tell him he's shite. (ALL LAUGH) (WHISPERS) I love you. I love you. (CROWD CHEERS) (APPLAUSE) (SPEAKS SPANISH) A very good day to all of you... ..and thank you for coming... ..to this very important presentation... ..of one of the greatest players in the world. Good luck in this team. Best wishes and we place our hopes in you. Many thanks. (APPLAUSE) (CROWD CHEERS) MAN: (ON RADIO) Over 10,000 fans turned up to the BernabÂeu today to welcome Real's latest signing, Santiago MuÄnez. WOMAN: (ON RADIO) Newcastle United fans are still coming to terms with the loss of Santiago MuÄnez, two years before the end of his original contract. ..Real Madrid, in exchange for Michael Owen, has shocked fans... MAN: (ON RADIO) The Mexican-born striker runs the risk of spending the season sitting on the bench. (SPEAKS SPANISH) How much do you think this one cost? I couldn't care less if the Bernabeu goes bankrupt. MUNEZ: (ON TV) Well, I've always been a fan of Real Madrid - me and my grandma, my brother - so it's like a dream come true for me to be playing in this team, yeah. Goal! WOMAN: (ON TV) Is it true only a year ago you were a gardener? Well, I come from a very simple background. My story is a little bit different than most of the players in this team. Rosa. -MUNEZ: For me, it's... -Rosa! MUNEZ: It's a big responsibility. (SPEAKS SPANISH) The omelette. It's lunchtime. MUNEZ: I'm gonna try to be at the same level as everybody else. It's an honour to be playing with all these great players like Zidane and David, Roberto Carlos, everybody, so... WOMAN: And do you think you're prepared for everything that's just about to hit you? (CHEERING) (ENGINE REVS) First day of school. Make me proud. I will, Mama. -Miss Harmison? -Here. Where have you been - training or shopping? -Oh, my God. -It's for us, baby. -Have they given you all this? -It's for us. Ooh! -Wow. Can I have one? -Sure. They're for you. Pick a car. Any car. God, you're gonna have to score a lot of bloody goals. I'll try. COMMENTATOR: The UEFA Champions League is back and it's back at the Santiago BernabÂeu. What a stage for Europe's top club competition. (BOTH SPEAK SPANISH) Hey. Oh, my God. Look at that. COMMENTATOR: Real Madrid - nine times winners, but not now for four years. This is where they kick off their latest campaign. An unhappy time for Gavin Harris - he has a point to prove. -Cheers. Good luck. -Cheers. (GIGGLES) COMMENTATOR: The new boy, MuÄnez, he starts from the bench. (REFEREE BLOWS WHISTLE) COMMENTATOR: Gavin Harris. He hasn't scored for 14 games. -The wait goes on. -(CROWD GROANS) (LIGHT APPLAUSE) (GRUNTS) COMMENTATOR: Just over half an hour to go. (REFEREE BLOWS WHISTLE) COMMENTATOR: Again the delivery. No finish. Harris again trying to influence proceedings. He's having a struggle out there tonight. Well, now, that should have been a goal. Yes, off the mark, off his game. (CROWD ROARS) And the crowd's starting to get on the Englishman's back. Oh, yeah. Look - there he is. COMMENTATOR: It's time for a new star. Does this spell the end for Gavin Harris? It's certainly a start of something new for Santiago MuÄnez. -Go on, Sant. -Go on, Santi. COMMENTATOR: MuÄnez ghosting in. He's looking menacing. Oh, dear, it's all coming to the boil. And look - Thomas Gravesen's brought his handbag. Beckham's corner. Not cleared. Only as far as MuÄnez. Now, could this be the moment? (CROWD ROARS) BOTH: Yes! Yes! Yeah! COMMENTATOR: It could not be a better start to his Real Madrid career. A last-minute goal for Santiago MuÄnez. (APPLAUSE) (SPEAKS SPANISH) BOY: Psst! -(SPEAKS SPANISH) Enrique. -Come on, come on. -Did you bring the dough? -Quick, before they catch us. OK, OK, this is for you and this is for me. What's in that head of yours? What do you want? For us to visit you in jail? Listen. One false move and you will ruin your life for ever. More ruined than it already is? Enrique, my love, don't say that! Look at that player, MuÄnez. He didn't have anything, like you. Look at him now. Apart from that, what the hell does that have to do with me? I'm going to tell you a secret. That player is your brother. -PHOTOGRAPHER: MuÄnez! -PHOTOGRAPHER 2: Santi! OK. OK. Take it easy. -Santi! -Come on out, darling. -ROZ: Ooh! -Careful. Are you alright? -Are you OK? -I caught my heel. Come on inside. Follow me. Come on. This way. Come on. Patience. Oh, and pick her up. She can't walk. Here we go. Is it always like this, or what? Yeah, it is, actually. They're all mad. -Total lunatics. -You don't sound surprised. -You love it. -What - being in the press? I'll tell you what. At the end of the day, I'd much rather be out with my friends, having a nice meal, a nice conversation... (SPEAKS SPANISH) Let it breathe for one minute. OK. There's more to life than just football. Do you know what I mean? What - like computer games? Come on. I mean, you're the first team. Oh, no, don't get me wrong. It pays the bills, I do love it. But I've got other interests as well. I mean, for example, wine. I've made an investment in a tasty little vineyard in France. Hmm. It could be my future, you know? Erm, I think it's corked. No, no. It's Covio de Special Reserve. Come on, jump on the plane with us. No-one will know. I think the coach might notice. The house is so empty without you. -It's only a couple of weeks. -I don't wanna go. Hmm. It'll be like you never left. -I love you. -Me too. -I'll call you, OK? -OK. -Anything you need, give me a ring. -Thank you. OK? (CROWD CHEERS) ('I LIKE THE WAY YOU MOVE' PLAYS) SONG: # Yeah, most of all # I like the way you move... # San, I'm desperate for the toilet. (THUMPING MUSIC PLAYS) (DISTANT LAUGHTER AND CHATTER) -Big pool. -Look at the gorgeous pool. -Hello. -Hey. Happy birthday. You didn't need to do that. I've already got everything. I won't bother next time. -29 again, are we? -Watch it. Look, I really need a wee. Where's the toilet? -It's back here. -See you in a minute. In that room. It's a bit of a way, I'm afraid. -Hey. What do you think? -Oh, man. -It's not bad, is it? -Different class. -How can you afford it? -I don't know. Barry sorts all that out. Hey, Barry! How can I afford this? Because I get you 80 grand a week, you plank. Oh, yeah. It's 'cause I'm on 80 grand a week. Hey, hey. Hang on. I've got something for you. Off you pop, then, treacle. Santi, what's up, man? Listen, you scored an absolute belter tonight, love. -You smashed it, brother. -Thanks, man. Listen, hey, what you thinking bringing Roz up here? This is what we call a bona fide singles party. Do you get me? -She's my fiancÂee. -GAVIN: Hey, Barry! Hey, ChÃateauneuf du Pape 1982. See what you think of that. -Nice. -Come on. Let's go outside. Oh, Santi, I've got a little idea for you, love. -Who's that? -No idea. So, how many rooms is this? I think it's eight, but I've only been in six. SANTI: It's sort of, like, a little bit weird. GAVIN: No, it's just one of those little Euro-style bathing suits. I don't think I'll wear it. You can wear it. -Hey, monkey. -Hello. Where have you been? Aren't you going to introduce me to your friend? Who, him? Jordana Garcia, Santiago MuÄnez. -She can't resist me. -I'll try. (SPEAKS SPANISH) Hi, Santiago. (SPANISH) Hi. How are you? Hmm. Dolce? Dolce, yes, yes. Really good goal, eh? Thanks, but I only played for seven minutes, so I wasn't. Well, you must be really tired then? Lovely arse. I WANT him. WOMAN: (LAUGHS) But I thought he had a girlfriend. And who cares? (THUMPING DANCE MUSIC) -Roz. -Hi. Hi, darling. It's so great to see you. Ta. Have you seen Santi? Santi. Yeah, I think he just popped upstairs with Gavin. -You look absolutely splendid. -Thank you. -Can I get you a drink? -Um, no. I'm gonna find Santi. -'Bye. See ya. -See ya later. Yeah. (SIGHS) There you are. I've been looking for you everywhere. -Hi. -Hi. -Roz, this is Jordana. -Hello. Hi, hi. He was just telling me about your lovely wedding. -You're a very lucky girl. -Not as lucky as he is. -True. -Can we go in? -It's a bit cold. -Yeah. Yeah, sure. (SPEAKS SPANISH) OK, then, you'll have to come on my TV show... ..before the other channels grab you, no? (ENGLISH) Well, thanks, but I'm not into all that stuff. Did you just say no to me? (LAUGHS) (SPEAKS SPANISH) You'll like it. I've been cornered by Barry. It was disgusting. He's such a lech. His hands were all over me. She walked around, like, without a top all night. She's a slut. I'm glad we're home. That was mad. -Gavino sure was in his element. -Mmm. What did you, um... What did you think of that TV girl? -TV girl? Who? -You know exactly who I mean. The one, "Did you just say no to me?" Her, silly cow. Do you think she's hot? -Uh... -Don't you pause! What do you mean? You just paused! You can't say yes. She's kinda OK. I think Gavino has a thing for her, actually. Well, she definitely likes you. I'm pretty irresistible. What can I do? -I don't think you're irresistible. -What? -No, I could take you or leave you. -I think I can change that. -Do you? -I think so, yeah. Sant, why are we here? This is our house. -You've bought it?! -Yeah, I did. -Oh, you haven't. -Yeah. What do you think? -Come on. -Sant. -Look. -Oh, my God. It's massive. Look at the size of this thing. It's beautiful. It's amazing. Oh, wow. I like the kitchen. -It's great. -Yeah. (POPS CORK) This house belonged to a very famous designer. What's his name? Uh... (GRUNTS) Well, they say he's gonna be the next Versace, OK? A lot of the things inside, and the furniture, were designed by him. -We have seven bedrooms. -Seven? -Yeah. And seven bathrooms.

I'm betting on Prada. I'm not sure his girlfriend will help much. She looks pretty. A little pale, but... (SPANISH SONG PLAYS) (PHONE RINGS) Hello? -MOTHER: (ON PHONE) Hello, pet. -Hey, Mam.

I'm at the hotel and they're not letting us out till the match tomorrow. It's a funny farm in here. I'm locked up with a bunch of dimwits. You should feel right at home, then. Seriously. How about sneaking in? You could come up in one of them laundry baskets. Not tonight. I need my beauty sleep. I look awful. -"Oh, Jordana, Jordana." -Oh, shut it!

You're not afraid, are you? (LAUGHS) (LAUGHS) SANTI: Hey! Hey, Gavino! Open this! HEY! PLEASE! (WOMEN LAUGH) (COMMENTARY PLAYS ON TV) You could pay someone to do that for you, you know. -Professionals. -I like doing it, Mam. It makes the place feel like home. His head is bound to be full of a million different things right now. -You should be one of them. -I've gotta be here, Mam. They need me down the hospital. And even if I was there, I wouldn't be allowed to see him. He's locked up in hotels with the team more than half the week. What's the point of having this classy house if only you're in it? I'm serious, love. It may only be a few hundred miles to Madrid, but if you let it, it could become a world away.

VAN DER MERWE: Mr Harris, what's going on with you? You were a disaster. Are you ever going to score another goal? Yeah, at this moment in time I'm a very bad player. (LAUGHTER) SANTI: Hey, coach. MuÄnez. Uh, can I have a word? Sure. Well, I'm feeling great, I'm fit, I'm scoring goals and I think I'm ready to start a full game. When you are ready to start, MuÄnez, I promise you you'll be the first to know. (PHONE RINGS) -Hey. -SANTI: (ON PHONE) Hey, baby. You're not gonna believe what I just bought for us. -Go on. -Guess. Come on. I don't know, Sant. Come on, come on! (SIGHS) I'm not really in the mood for games. Lamborghini, white, convertible, Spider. Different class. Roz? Mr Ives died this morning. I was gonna phone you just to have someone to talk to, but I didn't wanna bring you down. -I'm sorry, baby. -I've gotta go. Do you think MuÄnez is ready for a full game? I think it's too early. Maybe you should think again. (TYRES SCREECH) (SPANISH) What's wrong with you? Can't you see I almost killed you? My name is Enrique. I'm your brother. What? My mother married your father, Hernan MuÄnez, in Mexico. (TYRES SQUEAL, ENGINE REVS) I've got the client screaming down my throat. I dunno what I'm gonna say to them. Mr MuÄnez, I'm glad you could make it, sir. Do you mind?! We're gonna go straight through to the studio just here. How long is this gonna take? It shouldn't be too long, I promise you, sir. Go straight through. -OK, rolling. -104, take 27. And action. And that's why I go for Total Tofu every time - the superfood for the super sub. Yeah! -Mmm. -Mmm. Mmm! Right, cut! Great. That was great. Let's do it one more time, then, Santiago. Did you do that? (PHONE RINGS) Well, it says here you did, Phil. -Santiago. -Hey, Glen, this shit is not on. These people are making a fool out of me, man. Who, Sant? This commercial. David Beckham gets Gillette and I get freaking...tofu! GLEN: You've got to start somewhere, Santiago. It's good money, after all. I don't think you should complain. SANTI: No, it's disgusting! Why don't you try eating it for five hours straight? Give me a break, man, please. OK. Well, look, I'll have a... You know what? I'm better than this. Jesus! Was that Santiago? Aye, it was. MAN: (ON TV) For the first time this season, the coach, Rudi van der Merwe, has a real decision to make. He's got Santi MuÄnez and Gavin Harris, and Gavin certainly appears to have been on his holidays this season. MAN 2: (ON TV) Well, I think so. You're talking about 5 million quid they pay for the boy and at the moment he doesn't look like he's worth a fiver to me. Hey! Surprise! -(GIGGLES) -Ah! I'm glad to see you. Cheeky git - he just ran in front of the car?! There you go. Are you alright? You look a bit in shock. Hey? Come on, it'll be alright. Eat your dinner. Well, did he say anything else? No, nothing - when he threw that at me I was so freaked I just drove off, I couldn't breathe. Well, it might not be a bad thing. You've always talked about wanting to find her. Yeah. I know, but right now I cannot deal with it. In my head she was gone forever. She does really look like you. (PHONE RINGS) Hey. WOMAN: (ON PHONE) Santiago. -Where did you get this? -SANTI: Is it her, Grandma? GRANDMA: When you went to Spain, I worried this might happen. Wait. You knew? I couldn't tell you, Santiago. I didn't wanna cause you pain. My God, Grandma! She's my mother and you didn't tell me?! -What gave you the right? -That woman left all of us. She just walked away, left your father in pieces. Yes, but it's my choice. She's my mother. She abandoned you, Santiago. How can you forgive her for that? OK, Grandma, let me decide, please. (SIGHS) (EXCITED HUBBUB) Santi! Santi! Santi! Santi! Santi! (CROWD ROARS) (SILENCE) Santi, are you listening? COMMENTATOR: It's a very, very big night for that young man. Santiago MuÄnez, for the first time since he's moved from Newcastle, starts again for Real Madrid, illustrious company alongside him, to say the least. Just look at those names. They tend to be feisty, these encounters between these two, Real Madrid and Valencia. It's Beckham forward early on. He's picked out MuÄnez. RaÂul alongside him. But MuÄnez goes for goal and glory himself. COMMENTATOR 2: Wanted the glory, but I don't think RaÂul was too happy. Perhaps he wanted that one squared. -COMMENTATOR 1: RaÂul! -(CROWD GROANS) Ramos back to clear off the line. David Beckham now. Just about hooked away by Valencia, under a little bit of pressure here. But now they can counter. Picked up by Vicente, who is taken down by Santi MuÄnez. Now, MuÄnez could be in real trouble here. He is! It's a red card. MuÄnez sent off on his first start for Real Madrid. COMMENTATOR 2: Well, it's unbelievable, isn't it? I think that's a man who's a little bit rusty. It was a late challenge. He gave the referee nowhere to go. Vicente was really clipped down. And it's a sad day for MuÄnez. COMMENTATOR 1: From dreams to nightmares for Santi MuÄnez. His first start and now his first early bath. Off comes ZinÂedine Zidane, and it's Gavin Harris who will come on. Plenty of tackles flying in out there. And that's Guti. CaÄnizares - what is he doing? Not just with his hair, either. COMMENTATOR 2: This is not a typical Real Madrid game, is it? The early sending off has really set the tone for the match. COMMENTATOR 1: And another effort blocked away by Casillas, with the follow-up just wide. COMMENTATOR 2: Down to 10 men. It's gonna be hard work for Real Madrid. They have to get their passing game going. COMMENTATOR 1: Beckham, with a free kick. And he has not quite found his range tonight. David Beckham with the cross. Here's Gavin Harris! -Goal for Real Madrid! -(CROWD ROARS) And they lead 1-0. The drought is over. COMMENTATOR 2: Well, that's a goal poacher's goal, isn't it? It was a great cross by Beckham. Harris is in there in the 6-yard area, doing what he does best, and stoops to conquer. COMMENTATOR 1: So, Real Madrid scraping home in the end, that late goal from Gavin Harris. But Santiago MuÄnez, his moment of madness very nearly cost them the game. A red card he could have no excuse about, Tony. COMMENTATOR 2: Yeah, it was a poor foul, poor challenge and reckless. The referee had no option. He had to go. MAN ON TV: Gavin, Gavin. (SPEAKS SPANISH) This was your first goal in 17 games. How do you feel? GAVIN: Uh...yeah. Um... (SPANISH) It's a great day. I'm very happy. I'm going drinking with lots of girls. (LAUGHS) GAVIN: (SPANISH) Goodnight. (SPANISH) Hello, hothead. Hello. Look, I have the solution to all your problems. Really? Mm-hm. Tequila, please. (LAUGHS) And I need you on my show tomorrow whilst you're still playing for Madrid. You won't give up, will you? What do you think? (CHUCKLES) Another? Another, please. You started it. I didn't. -Do you need a ride? -No, thanks. -'Bye. -'Bye. Sant. Darlin'. Hey. -Sweetheart, wake up. -(GRUNTS) -Hey. Come on, sleepyhead. -(GRUNTS) Darlin'. Look, I brought you breakfast. Do you want some juice? -Uh-uh. -You've been asleep for ages. -Here. -(SIGHS) Sant. -Why didn't you wake me up?! -I did. I tried earlier. -But you were dead to the world. -You should've tried harder! -I told you to wake me up! -I've just told you... Are you stupid or something? I'm gonna miss the team plane. Thank you! I'm not stupid. And I'm not a bloody alarm clock! Hi. Trondheim, first class. OK. I'll see what I can do. -Champagne, sir? -MAN: Yes, please. Nah, nah, I got it. I got it. -Excu... Excuse me. Sorry. -Aargh! Sorry. Sorry about the peanuts. It's been a good one, Santi. The coach sends his apologies for not coming to greet you, but I know he's very keen to see you. (EXCITED HUBBUB) (EXCITING ROCK MUSIC) (CHEERING) Please! What is he doing? (SNEEZES) (GAVIN GRUNTS) Aarggh! Warm up. Welcome to Norway. Not such a great day, Sant? Hey. I got a call from the boss. There's gonna be repercussions, hefty fine, probably. (BLOWS NOSE) Nil-nil, and he had me sitting on my freezing ass for 90 minutes. He's the coach, Sant. He calls the shots. He's sending you a message. Perhaps you should listen. Don't patronise me, Glen. I mean, I'm doing commercials for goddamn tofu and you're fixing cars in Newcastle. I'm always there for you, Sant. Well, I need someone full-time in Madrid to support me off the pitch. Well, perhaps this is where I get off, eh? (SNIFFS) It's been a great ride, Santi. And a privilege. You know, your plate's getting so full so fast, you should watch what falls off the edge. Roz? GAVIN: I don't know what you're saying, but I love it! I don't know what you're saying, but I do love it. -(GIRLS LAUGH) -GAVIN: Careful! (GIRLS LAUGH AND CHATTER) (SPEAKS SPANISH) Come on, open up. Come on, open. Come on, open. We're peeing ourselves. Come on, open up. GAVIN: Um, girls, I'm gonna have to take you home. What? Where do you live? (DOORBELL BUZZES) (DOORBELL CONTINUES BUZZING) Coming, coming, coming. -Any room at the inn? -Gavino? -(UNLOCKS DOOR) -You're a diamond. So, how long are you gonna need to stay? Um, quite a while, I'd imagine. As long as you need, man. GAVIN: The vineyard was a scam. Barry - not a very good agent. Hey, Santi! Where's the milk? (WHISPERS) Um, would sir like one lump or two with his tea? I don't know why she's so angry. Well, you can understand. I mean, she's up there all alone in that big house and you're out with dark-haired Spanish beauties. Yeah, but I'm not out with dark-haired Spanish beauties. No, I'm just saying, you know, she can only imagine the worst, can't she? Yeah. But I've never given her any reason to imagine the worst. Yeah, I know. But you're an international Latin sex symbol. She knows how many girls have got your photo on the wall. But that's part of the job. She could try to understand. I don't know. I'll talk to her during the Christmas break. -(CRASH!) -Ow! Aarggh! Oh, stop mucking about. You Latinos, you're always diving. I can't. It really hurts, man. -What, you're serious? -Yeah, yeah! It really hurts. Aarggh! (GROANS) Ow. Don't worry about it, man. I'm sure it's nothing. You're not to set foot outside of this facility or your home. But I have travel plans for the Christmas break, coach. You're going nowhere. Do we have an understanding? I hope so. ROZ: But I don't understand. What's the point of them keeping you there? You can't even do any training. Because they pay me, Roz. They call the shots. I cannot change that, OK? I don't believe this. It's not fair. You promised. -Well, why don't you come here? -No! All the times I've been to Madrid, you've not come home once, Santi. You've not set foot in Newcastle. This is another bloody excuse. You can't even call Glen, 'cause you've sacked him. Well, I'm getting sick of it. Baby, it's out of my hands. I'm sorry. Look, I don't want to speak to you right now, OK? (HANGS UP) (SIGHS) MOTHER: There, there, Roz, pet. Have a nice glass of champagne. Thanks. It's a shame Santi couldn't be here. He's probably partying with them GalÂacticos in Spain. Look at the size of this bad boy. (SPEAKS SPANISH) (SPANISH) Let's see if you can guess what this is. It isn't easy. It's the original Champions League ball. Oh, I miss you too, Gran. You watching 'The Great Escape'? What - Steve McQueen? I know, he's a dish. OK. Big kiss. 'Bye. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. (EXCITED CHATTER, MUSIC PLAYS) (PHONE RINGS AT OTHER END) ROZ: We can't get to the phone at the moment, but leave a message and we'll call back. -(BEEP!) -Hey. It's me. I can't believe we're not together on New Year's Eve. SANTI: Remember the party last year? Jamie told me that was the night little Keanu was conceived. I don't know how he can remember, but... Hey, listen, uh...I love you... ..I miss you. Happy new year. (APPLAUSE) (PEOPLE CHATTER, MUSIC PLAYS) Hey, Sant. Sant. (PEOPLE SQUEAL) -Come on. -Nah. (ALL CHEER) Who was that? Who was that? I've heard there's a tradition in Spain which involves, um... (HIGHER-PITCHED) ..having a grape for every... Hang on, hang on, don't be greedy. Having a grape for every single dong when it goes on the... Oh, you want some as well. OK. Oh, dear, what's it gonna sound like? Aunt Annie? So, you have one grape for every dong when it goes and then... So we've got four minutes. (ALL COUNT IN SPANISH) (ALL CHEER, WHISTLES BLOW) (FIREWORKS BOOM IN THE DISTANCE) What? I didn't say anything. No, but you were looking at me like...like...like...like that. With a look. No, I wasn't. Nothing happened. OK. Nothing happened. (SPANISH) Do you think I look like him? (SPANISH) Yes, yes, I see it now. Really? Your face and his ass. Hey! (WINDOW SMASHES) (LAUGHS) (WOMAN SHOUTS IN SPANISH) You've broken my window. Enrique, I'm telling your mother. Idiot. Need a ride? OK. (ENGINE REVS) Well, where do you live? Straight ahead. Hey. Hey, hey, hey. -Who's she? -My girlfriend. Leave it. Nice. Don't break them. Do you like football? Yes. (CAMERA CLICKS) So, tell me about your mother. What's she saying? What is she doing? Well, she's a drag, but I keep away from her. (INSTRUMENTS BEEP) Leave it, man. MAN: Yeah? Hello? Hey, Mr Bunderguey. Will you give me a tryout? Wait, you're calling the coach! Do you want me to get in trouble? What's your problem? I don't have anything, I live in poverty and my parents work all day to save the business. But I have a brother who's an idiot and who does nothing for me. What's in the bag? Nothing. My things. Enrique! Enrique! (PEOPLE CHATTER) (SPANISH) Where did you get that? My brother gave it to me. You know, we can't be part of his life. But he's my brother. Why do I have to keep him a secret? Because in this house you do as I say! I shouldn't have told you. Forget about him. You're not part of his world. (ENRIQUE SOBS) (CROWD ROARS) Ow. (CROWD ROARS) Have they decided to keep you on till Santi's fit, have they? Oh, piss off, you nonce. Santi, you given up that little nurse for Jordana? What did you say? Gonna show us that fiery Mexican temper of yours, are ya? GAVIN: Come on, leave it. (DANCE MUSIC PLAYS) Hey, why are you calling me? (SPEAKS SPANISH) Who, me? You called me three times. ENRIQUE: (SPANISH) Hey, Salgado, bring a couple of birds. I'm in the white Lamborguini. Hey, what's wrong? Where's my Lambo? The keys, man? In the glove compartment. Hey! Hey! Enrique! Hey! Enrique! -Follow that car! -The Lamborguini? Yes, follow it! -Like in the movies? -Step on it! DRIVER: These crooks. -No, it's my brother. -Oh, he's your brother? What's he doing? (HORNS BLARE) Enrique! Enrique! To the hospital! (SPANISH) Hey, a doctor! Hey, a doctor! Straight ahead, straight ahead. Is he OK? Is he conscious? Yes. MAN: (SPANISH) And so you simply lost control? I told you my phone rang, I got distracted. I shouldn't have answered it. Who was the boy with you? The son of a friend of mine. I've already told you that too. Calm down. And how much alcohol did you say that you had consumed? -Come on! Get up! Get up! -Get him off me! Come on! -Get up! -It just gets better and better. Come on! Get up! Get up! I'm just doing my job. (PHONE RINGS AT OTHER END) (PHONE RINGS) -MAN: Hello? -SANTI: Hey. I'm sorry for calling so late. -What's up? -I'm in a bit of trouble here. -Actually, I've really messed up. -Why? What have you done? I hit a photographer. They've arrested me. (GROANS) Where are you? Are you OK? Yeah, yeah, I'm OK. I'm not your agent anymore, Santiago, remember? I know, I know. I just... I don't deserve this, man. I really don't. I'm sorry. Don't apologise to me, save it for those that need it. You're not a kid anymore, you're a grown man. You've earned a lot of praise on the pitch. It's time to earn some respect in the real world, where it matters. OK, I'm not coming out. You're on your own. (DOOR LOCKS) (REPORTERS CLAMOUR) -Roz? -Mm-hm? -Did you know about this? -About what? It's everywhere. (PHONE RINGS) -Hey. -How could you? You didn't even have the wit to do it in private. You had to go and flaunt it in front of the whole world. What are you talking about? You're in all the magazines, Sant, with that girl. Magazines? What girl? Is she why you couldn't come home at Christmas? How long's it been going on? No! You're getting it all wrong. The press twists all that stuff. It's here in front of me. I can see exactly what you've been doing. Stop lying. SANTI: I'm not lying. If that's the type of girl you want, you can have her. It's fine, I don't care. You've made a fool out of me, Santi. I don't deserve this. (HANGS UP) SONG: # A hundred days have made me older # Since the last time that I saw your pretty face # A thousand lies have made me colder # And I don't think I can look at this the same # But all the miles that separate... # (MAN SPEAKS SPANISH) # Disappear now when I'm dreaming of your face # I'm here without you, baby # But you're still on my lonely mind # I think about you, baby... # (PHONE RINGS) # And I dream about you all the time... # SANTI: (ON MACHINE) Please, Roz, call me back. I need to talk to you, OK? 'Bye. # And tonight it's only you and me # I'm here without you, baby... # (WHISTLE BLOWS) # But you're still on my lonely mind # I think about you, baby # And I dream about you all the time # I'm here without you, baby # But you're still with me in my dreams... # (PHONE RINGS) # And tonight, girl, it's only you and me # Yeah # Oh, yeah # Oh, oh, oh # Oh, oh. # MAN: Goalless after the first leg of this Champions League semifinal back at the Stade Gerland. Now attention switches to the BernabÂeu. (WHISTLE BLOWS) COMMENTATOR: Gavin Harris on the ball now. He's really improved his form lately. Great, quick feet again. Robinho. Strong and powerful himself. Gavin Harris getting forward well. (SHOUTS) The stakes could not be higher in the Spanish capital. (WHISTLE BLOWS) In comes Beckham's cross. Harris could be in here! -Oh, Gavin Harris! -(CROWD ROARS) Gavin Harris is enjoying life at the moment. The BernabÂeu rises to salute Gavin Harris. He's done his job out there. A player at the top of his game. And on comes MuÄnez. Oh, five minutes for the super sub. Two months out injured. Five minutes to show his worth. Well, he'll be looking to get an early touch. And he does well here, MuÄnez. Looking sharp. Immediately into the action. And just wide. MuÄnez has opened it up for himself! And MuÄnez scores! Now they are heading for the final. What a finish. Just let it run with his front foot through the back of the legs. Little flick round the corner and a textbook finish into the far side. It was touch-and-go there tonight. Yeah, well, they had us pinned for the first 45 minutes or so, but those Lyon boys will be sick as parrots 'cause it's a game of two halves, yeah? And it ain't over till the fat lady sings. So that's football, isn't it? Do you think you'll play in the final or do you think the coach will choose Santiago instead? (REPORTERS CLAMOUR) Hi, Santiago. You played a fantastic game. You got Real Madrid into the final. How do you feel? Well, I'm just glad we made it. And, um...it's all there to play for now. Everyone knows you guys are buddies. It must be putting pressure on your friendship. We're a team. But first we're friends. Thanks. (CAR STARTS) (WHISTLES) (SPANISH) Nice one, friends! I'm off! Alright. Thanks. Take care. Thank you. (SPANISH) Excuse me. Have you seen this person? No? Thanks. Have you... You'll get it tomorrow. Watch out. Someone's coming. See you tomorrow. Hey, man. Have you seen this woman? No. You know, that's a nice watch. I might know where she works. Isn't that...? I think so. Can I help you? Is Rosa here? Rosa. Rosa, come out for a minute, please. What's going on? I'm sorry, gents, we're closing. I've just ordered, man. What are you saying? We've just ordered. BARMAN: That's it for today. The next one's on us. Please, please, see you tomorrow. We're open as usual tomorrow. Santiago. Miguel. (SPANISH) This is my son. Why did you go? Why did you leave us? It's... It's a little hard to explain. It had nothing to do with any of you. (ENGLISH) It had everything to do with us. (ENGLISH) I abandoned you. I was, uh...walking home late one night and, uh... ..two men attacked me. One of them was your uncle. I, um... ..managed to get home. I knew then that I could never tell your father what happened. And I panicked. And I ran away. Well, yeah, but not even a call? To explain? Santiago...I came back three weeks later and you were all gone. And no-one could tell me where my family had disappeared to. And those who could wouldn't. But it was too late. You had left Mexico. When I saw you on the television... ..I wanted to get in touch with you so much. But I was sure that you wished me dead. How could you think that? I was angry. My dad was angry. He died full of anger at you, at everything. At the world. (SPANISH) He loved you very much. Forgive me. Everything's going to be OK, you'll see. (BOY LAUGHS) (SPANISH) Enrique, Enrique, look who's coming! -Can I play? -Of course. Who's that? It's Enrique's brother. Goal! Yeah! (BOYS CHEER) (CLEARS THROAT) -What the hell are you doing? -Oh, nothing. I mean, I've been getting these rashes on my face from some sort of allergies or something and this keeps it away. You have a rash on your face? Well, it's just a little irritation. That's weird, man. Um...you know what? I'm gonna be honest with you here. I'm... I'm getting wrinkles. It's not a rash, I'm just getting wrinkles. That's all. What? I've got creaky legs and I'm getting wrinkles and my contract's up at the end of the season, so I just thought I should do whatever I can. Do you know what I mean? 'Cause I'm not yet sure what I'm gonna do when I'm done playing and all that. So you're putting face pack on to extend your contract? Well, not really. I mean...kind of. Wow. Well, um...tell me when you're done here, OK? Yeah, OK. I'll see you later, yeah? Yeah. Grandma! Mail from Santi! Oh. (SPEAKS SPANISH) Who is that? That's your mother and stepbrother. Oh. Boss? Listen, I'm in a meeting. I have to call you back. OK. Uh... What is it? Are you gonna start me in the final? Keep me on the bench. Play Gavino. Please. If he plays well in the final he could still make the World Cup team for England. Gracias. ROZ: If you leave a message, we'll call you back. (BEEP!) SANTI: Hey, it's me. You know I'm not good at this, but before I go out tonight and play the biggest game of my life, I wanted to call you because I need you to hear me out. Everything has turned inside out since I came here. And all this money, I don't need it. Without you it's nothing. I finally met my mom. It's still hard to take in. It'll take a long time. But I think it might be fine now. I'm not gonna make excuses for what I've done. All I can say is I'm just so sorry for treating you like I did and for pushing you away. I've been a total jerk. I know I took my eye off the ball, but I want to make things right. I love you. Please call me and, well, let me know if I can see you. I just want a second chance. (SPEAKS SOFTLY) Gentlemen. I'm proud of you. You made it. The Champions League final. And I don't want you to forget why you're here. I want you to play as if you have nothing to lose. Forget the money. Forget the press. Forget the cameras. Forget everything. Enjoy. COMMENTATOR: This is it, quite simply the biggest club game on the planet - the Champions League final. Real Madrid against Arsenal and it's in the BernabÂeu. Real Madrid feeling it's their destiny to get their name on this trophy yet again in their own backyard. And what a galaxy of stars we've got on show here today. COMMENTATOR 2: So many match winners on show, Bill. And I just wonder which one will be the one tonight to take that trophy home. Will it be Thierry Henry, Fabregas or TJ Harper? And then you look at Real Madrid, so many fine players - Beckham, Zidane, and, of course, the in-form Gavin Harris. You listen to me. You watch yourself. COMMENTATOR: Well, it was the goals from MuÄnez and Harris which got Real Madrid to the final, but only Gavin Harris has his place in the starting line-up. Santiago MuÄnez on the bench. Glory within touching distance for the footballers of Arsenal and Real Madrid. We're off and under way at the BernabÂeu. Gavin Harris with a neat little touch, but he's given it to Harper. Harper breaking clear for Arsenal in the first minute. Down he goes. -(BLOWS WHISTLE) -The referee gives a penalty! Oh, no. Pen. I can't believe that Harris was suckered into that. And a yellow card to boot. He'd lost possession to TJ Harper, tried to get it back, gave away the foul. I'm not so sure, Bill. That wasn't a pen to me. TJ Harper will step up and take it. (WHISTLE BLOWS) Looking for the dream start for Arsenal! 1-0! (CROWD CHEERS) Well, he may have dived for the penalty and suckered Harris into it, but what a penalty. Casillas had no chance. Low down to the keeper's left, the perfect pen. The dream final for Real Madrid has started to turn into something of a nightmare. Arsenal have hit the ground running. This is Jose Antonio Reyes for Thierry Henry! Whoa, should have scored, Thierry Henry. Good jump, should have gone back across the keeper. It was a great cross from Reyes, super shape on it. Should have been 2-0. The stars of Real Madrid are being eclipsed by the North Londoners. Henry for Reyes! Casillas again providing a vital save for Real Madrid. Well, he's saving the GalÂacticos at the moment, Casillas. The Arsenal youngsters are the ones rising to the occasion. Forward for Arsenal again. It's wave after wave of Gunners attacks. It's Freddie Ljungberg here. And out comes Casillas. Man of the match for Real Madrid in this first half, he really has been. (WHISTLE BLOWS) Real Madrid saved, really, by the half-time whistle. It's been a torrid first 45 minutes for them. Changes surely afoot at half-time. MuÄnez, go warm up. You go on. Whoo! Hey, ladies! -Oh, is she upset? -Yes! Do you want a go?! 'Cause I'll take you on, you little weasel! Leave it. He's not worth it. -Easy, easy, easy. -(ALL SHOUT) TJ made you look like an idiot. I know, boss. Look, I know what you're gonna... Here's what I want you to do. I want you to push forward. I'm bringing in Santi. You'll play him behind. Now, get the hell out there and show me some cojones. COMMENTATOR: Well, here comes the change, but it's not quite as we thought. On comes MuÄnez, but he's gonna come on to partner Gavin Harris. COMMENTATOR 2: I don't think Arsenal would have even pre-empted this one. I wonder how it's gonna work between the pair. They have to strike up the understanding very quickly. Not since their Newcastle days have they lined up together. It's tantalisingly close now for Arsenal, isn't it? Just 45 minutes away from winning the European Cup for the first time in their history. Fabregas finds Henry. This is a strong, purposeful, excellent run from Henry. It's majestic! And it's 2-0 to Arsenal! King Henry for Arsenal. The captain leads them one step closer to European glory and Real Madrid have another nail in their coffin. Where's Beckham? Where's Ronaldo? Where's RaÂul? Where's Gavin Harris? The big names have to start stepping up for Real Madrid. Here comes Henry again. Goodness me, he's in the mood tonight, Henry. So are his team-mates. Cleared, but back for Thierry Henry. Can he get another here, Henry? Goes to ground, it's come to Fabregas. But it's come to nothing. COMMENTATOR 2: I just wonder when Real Madrid are gonna get started. It's all Arsenal - 2-0 up and looking like they could go further ahead. COMMENTATOR 1: A rare Real Madrid attack. Zidane. Beckham wants it out on this left-hand side. Ronaldo. All names we've seen too little of so far. Here is Ronaldo, but Lehmann got there first. Arsenal with this extraordinary run of clean sheets in this competition and this road to the final. Looks like a road that will end with glory for them. -Robert Pires now. -Clear it, clear it! Again, it's Casillas. COMMENTATOR 2: And if it wasn't for Casillas, I think it could've been a bit of a rout. Very embarrassing for Real Madrid. COMMENTATOR 1: Plenty of furrowed brows amongst the all-stars of Real Madrid, and in this bumper crowd here at the BernabÂeu. TJ Harper, who started the ball rolling for Arsenal. Sees Cicinho, forward for Real Madrid. Arsenal have it back. Aliaksandr Hleb, teed up for Thierry Henry. Real Madrid just can't get a foothold in this game. Here comes Freddie Ljungberg. He's brought down! It's gonna be another penalty to Arsenal here. It is! The Real Madrid defence just can't cope with Thierry Henry. Took it down in one touch. Turned, just Freddie Ljungberg behind the back four. And, no doubt about it, it was a foul and it was a penalty. Things are just getting worse and worse for Real Madrid, and if this goes in, 3-0 and echoes of that Barcelona defeat last season. And surely if TJ Harper hits the target and scores, it's all over for Real Madrid. (BLOWS WHISTLE) Saved! Onto the bar! Casillas does his bit for Real Madrid again. And MuÄnez looking for Harris. He's the furthest man up field. Arsenal have been caught out here. Too many men committed forward. Gavin Harris, on his own, going for goal! Real Madrid are back in this final! What an extraordinary turn of events. Arsenal disappointed. It hits the bar, rebounds out to MuÄnez, and in one fell swoop, a great ball up front to Harris, a superb dip and volley over Lehmann. Four minutes. Four very long minutes for Arsenal, four very short ones for Real Madrid. Maybe, just maybe, they CAN get back into this game. Beckham. He's picked out Harris. MuÄnez wants it. Finally, they start to combine. It's MuÄnez. Lehmann tips it onto the bar. What a save that was. Reflexes from Lehmann, a close-in volley from MuÄnez. At last, Harris and MuÄnez really linking up with each other. These two can play together. The clock ticks on. Gravesen looks forward for Real Madrid. Arsenal, for the first time in the match, really under pressure. Here's Cicinho. They know, Arsenal, they are in a match now. There's Gravesen urging on his team-mates. He knows how important it is, and the game can still be won. Beckham's corner. Lehmann punches clear. Well, he's had his problems, Lehmann, with the crosses coming in, but there he's really confident and elects to punch. Into stoppage time we go. Two minutes at the end of this extraordinary Champions League final. Roberto Carlos with a high-lofted ball. Desperation time, really, for Real Madrid. (CHEERING) The super sub with a super goal! 2-2! Arsenal's shell-shocked. The BernabÂeu is rocking. They really believe they could go on and win this final now. They've scored once in stoppage time. Can they do it again? Guti. Harris with the touch on. Here comes Santiago MuÄnez! Brought down. -(WHISTLE BLOWS) -Free kick, Real Madrid. Yes! If there's anyone you'd want in this situation, it's David Beckham. Cometh the moment, cometh the man. It's Beckham to win the Champions League for Real Madrid. Beckham! It's looking good! It's in! David Beckham has done it for Real Madrid! They are European champions! COMMENTATOR 2: The most incredible finish in a Champions League final you'd ever wish to see. COMMENTATOR 2: Beckham with the winning goal, Real Madrid with the winning habit! They were down and out at 2-0. They've come back into it. And it's those three who have led them to European glory.
