(PAUL SIMON'S "ME AND JULIO DOWN BY THE SCHOOLYARD" PLAYING) (FILM REEL WHIRRING) (LAUGHING) WALTER: That's me, Walter. Where... Where'd you go? Oh, there you are! WALTER: I have the best life in the whole world. (LAUGHING) (LAUGHS) That's my brother, Gary. He's the best friend you could ever have. Yeah, I know what you're thinking. We could be twins.

That was so fun! WALTER: Nothing is. (LAUGHS) MAN: Sorry, kid. GIRL: I wanna do that again! MAN 2: Come on. I'll ride with ya! BOY: Hurry up! WALTER: Even the sunniest days can have a few clouds in them. Ride's bogus, anyway. Hey, wanna rent a video? WALTER: Yeah. Uh, race you home! WALTER: And, well, that night sorta changed everything. It's The Muppet Show, with our very special guest star, Mr. Steve Martin! (APPLAUSE ON TV) WALTER: I found them. (GASPING) WALTER: The Muppets. (THEME MUSIC PLAYING) (INHALING) WALTER: I guess you could say I was their number one fan. (GASPING) Oh, Gary, it's an entire map of The Muppet Studios. (RATTLING) (LAUGHS) (GASPING) WALTER: And they made all the difference. KIDS: Trick or treat! WALTER: Because from then on... Hey, guys. Oh, hey, Gary. Hey. Hi-ho, guys. Yay! (CHUCKLES) (LAUGHING) BOY: Is that Kermit the Frog? What is this, 1978? WALTER: ...even on the worst days, I knew that as the years passed... (GASPS) KERMIT: (ON TV) Cancel that last remark. WALTER: ...as long as there are singing frogs and joking bears...

WALTER: And as long as there are Muppets... (YAWNING) WALTER: ...for me... (ON TV) ...hair-growing tonic. WALTER: ...there's still hope. (GASPS) Ah! Bye-bye! (LAUGHING) KERMIT: Somebody get him! Animal. Hey, Animal, come on. The show's about to start. Show! Show! (YELLS) Hey, Walter, why don't you join us? MALE VOICE: Come on! (GLASS SQUEAKING) No! Wait! I want to be with you guys! Please let me in! Kermit! (SCREAMING, GASPING) Whoa! GARY: Walter, are you okay, buddy? You're drenched in sweat. Did you have the dream again? Um... no. Uh, hey, so, uh, when are you guys leaving today? Oh, um, just a couple hours now. Oh, wow, Gary, I think it is so cool you're taking Mary to Los Angeles. (LAUGHS) I can't believe you guys have been dating for 10 years. I know. Yeah, she wanted to do something special for this anniversary, and she's always wanted to see Los Angeles, so... Hey, uh, don't forget to send me a postcard from The Muppet Studios. Oh, yeah, I'm sorry. I can't do that, Walter. But, Gary... Because... you're coming with us! (GASPS) Oh, Gary! But what about Mary? She's fine. She said the more the merrier. I... I don't know what to say! The Muppet Studios are there, Gary. I can't believe this! Better get a move on. We don't want to miss that bus! No way! Who knows? Maybe Kermit will be there. I wouldn't get your hopes up, buddy. The Muppets haven't put on a show together in years. I don't think they use the studios for anything but tours anymore. Nah, I think that's just an Internet rumor. Like there's a country called Turkey. Walter, how many times do we have to go over this? Turkey is a very real country. Wow, Muppet Studios. I can't believe it!

Enjoy your anniversary dinner. Hi. Um, I got you these. Oh. Sorry. Um... It's probably from the dance number I was doing. It's okay. They're really sweet. You excited for our big trip to LA?

The lines might be shorter at Honeydew's Laboratory of Fun, so maybe we should start there instead. I just... I just can't wait! (POLICE SIREN WAILS) Oh, Walter, don't be nervous. Oh, I know. I just can't believe I'm here. The home of the Muppets! (WOMAN SPEAKING CHINESE) What... What happened to this place? Wh... Where is everyone, Gary? I don't know, buddy. It's so... Oh... Oh. Okay, well, I guess you guys are it for today. Ahem. Anyway, welcome to the original Muppet Studio, where dreams can come true. (COUGHS) (SPEAKING CHINESE) Is this the Universal Studios? Yes, it is. Okay, now if you'll just follow me, please. Okay. This used to be Kermit's office. Whoa. Mmm-hmm. It's really the highlight of the tour. You should see it sometime. Okay, this next building is where they kept the rope and the medium-gauge wire for the productions. Let's go take a look. GARY: Come on, buddy. (WHISPERS) Wow! Oh! Oh, boy. Oh! Whoa! (GASPS) (RATTLING) There. Now this here is Kermit the Frog's old office. Or so we've been "toad." (BOTH LAUGH) Well, as you know, gentlemen, I've loved the Muppets since I was a boy. ALL: Mmm-hmm. TEX: And what better way to honor the Muppets than to make this beautiful studio a Muppet museum. ALL: Mmm-hmm. I think I'll call this room the "Kermit the Frog's Old Office Room." Oh, that is lovely. Oh, good one, Mr. Richman. Now, this here is the standard "Rich and Famous" contract Kermit signed 30 years ago, that contains... The deed to this property. Exactly. Now, this contract is 100 percent ironclad, with one minor exception. If the Muppets can raise the 10 million dollars it would cost to buy the building before this contract expires, then they get their studio back. You know, if I didn't know better, I'd say you were reciting some sort of an important plot point. Well, I hope so. Otherwise, I just bored the audience half to death. You mean half the audience is still alive? (BOTH LAUGH) It's nice doing business with you. Yes, sir. Come on. Goodbye. Love geriatric humor. Gentlemen, there's oil under this studio. (SNIFFS) Yeah, I can smell it. And more importantly, the geological survey says there definitely is. Oh. In two weeks, we tear this place to the ground and start drilling. Ah, those Muppets. They think they're so funny. Well, it looks like the joke's about to be on them. Maniacal laugh. (LAUGHS) Maniacal laugh. (LAUGHING) Maniacal laugh. Maniacal laugh. (GASPS) Maniacal laugh. (GASPING) (SCREAMING) GARY: Walter! MARY: Walter? GARY: Walter! MARY: Walter! (SCREAMING) (CONTINUES SCREAMING) Yeah, so then, when he thought they were alone, he said, "There's oil under this studio, see. "I'm gonna tear it to the ground, see. "Sweet, sweet oil, see!" People still talk like that? Maybe that's just how he sounded in my head. Either way, we've got to find Kermit! He'll know what to do. How do we find Kermit? Nobody's seen him in years. WALTER: (GASPS) Stop the car! I've got an idea! ALL: Mmm! These are delicious! Mmm-hmm. Great idea, Walter. Mmm-hmm. GARY: We've been doing this for a long time. I think maybe we should call it a night. MARY: Guys! We can't give up, Gary. I know, but it's getting really late. Maybe we should just go back to the motel. Guys! It... What? What? Maybe he lives there. Oh. That's it. So, what do we do now? I don't see a doorbell. And the house looks empty. Gary, throw me over. What? Gary, just throw me over already! Okay. Okay, here we go. Okay... One, two, three. (CRACKING) That's good. (CRACKING) GARY: Sorry! WALTER: No, it's good. Guys? I think that's an electric fence. Mary, it's Kermit the Frog. GARY: Okay, buddy, head down. One, two, three! (SCREAMING) It's an electric fence. Yep. Oh, my gosh. Walter? Walter, buddy? Walter, can you hear me? (WHISPERS) Throw me again. No, I don't... I don't think that's a good idea. What kind of throw was that? Guys, I think there's somebody coming. KERMIT: Excuse me. (CHOIR SINGS) You okay? That was quite a tumble. Oh, oh, oh. Look, look. I think... Hey. Hey, Walter? Walter, you all right, buddy? Where am I? Okay, this is awesome. We're at Kermit's house. Oh, jeez. Walter. MARY: No, no, no, no, no. You okay? Uh... This... This is Kermit's house? (GASPING) Anyhow, how can I help you guys? Let me just say, this is an honor for all of us to meet you, sir, um, but my brother Walter has some really disturbing news for you. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Not now, '80s Robot. Might I offer you a drink? Tab? KERMIT: Good grief. New Coke? Listen. Not right now, '80s Robot, please! Bummer. Oh. KERMIT: Watch out for the... Gag me with a spoon. Yeah, head for the door. Grody to the max. Ow. Ow. I'm really sorry about that... Ow. ...Walter. Uh, what were you saying? Uh, yes. Tex Richman, the oil baron, is... Yes, yes, yes. Oil baron Tex Richman, the wealthy philanthropist. You know, he's about to buy our old Muppet Show theater and turn it into a Muppet museum. Isn't that great? No! I mean... I think what Walter's trying to tell you is that Tex Richman has a secret plan to tear down the theater and drill for oil. What? The only way to save the studio is to raise 10 million dollars. Ten million dollars? That's impossible. But... The only way to raise that kind of money would be to... Would be to put on a show.

That's all right, Kermit. It's not your fault. We had a good run. Yeah. Yeah, it's just that... Well, we haven't seen each other in a really long time, and I... I just thought maybe we could raise the money to buy the theater back if we all got together and put on one last show. A show? But I've spent years building a solo career. I have a whole new show-biz family that loves me. Fozzie! What the heck are you doing, hibernating? Next show starts in 30 seconds. We hired you, and we can fire you, so get your butt in here now!

It's our executive line of used toilets. ALL: Mmm... Anyway, I'm very busy. I've got 30 seconds. Go. (TICKING) Uh, Gonzo, I'm not quite sure how to say this, but... Don't forget to mention the evil oil baron. Yes, Fozzie, I was about to. Just give me a moment, okay? Uh, Gonzo, it would appear... Remember, evil oil baron. Fozzie, I'm going to get to that. Please! As I was trying to say... Evil oil baron. (BUZZER RINGS) Okay, time's up. Thank you, guys. Gonzo, we're trying to get the old gang back together again. We really need you. My answer is no. Good day! Hmm. Uh, come on, guys. We should go. I just want to say, when I was a kid, I saw you recite Hamlet while jumping your motorbike through a flaming hoop, and it made me feel like I could do anything. Thank you. Yeah. (CLUCKING) Gonzo... You don't have to pretend anymore. I know what you really want. Good try, Walter. GONZO: Hey, guys, up here! Yee-haw! Huh?

I'm so sorry to interrupt, but it's very important to these guys that they get their drummer... Gary! It's my trigger word, too. Jack, we talked about this on Tuesday. Tuesday's another one of my trigger words! Oh! Oh, I don't think so! Sorry. Let's go, Animal. ANIMAL: Bye-bye! Animal, heel. Go, Animal! Be free, man! But remember! No drumming! '80S ROBOT: Mr. Kermit, may I suggest we save time and pick up the rest of the Muppets using a montage? KERMIT: Ah, great idea, '80s Robot. (PLAYS GUITAR CHORD) We greatly appreciate your financial support. Whoa! '80S ROBOT: Eighty-seven point three miles to go. Eighty-seven point two...

Yeah, uh, how come you didn't use me in the montage? I thought my story was pretty interesting. (SNORING) Rowlf? Huh? What? Wanna get back together? Okay. Good. (LAUGHS) Classic. Anyhow, looks like we got everybody, so we can plan our telethon and raise that 10 million dollars. Well, not everybody. No, I think everybody's here. Where's... All good! Miss... All done here! Piggy? Kermit, we're going to get Miss Piggy, right? Okay, okay, okay, you're right. We'll go get Piggy! (PHONE DIALING) My Minitel tells me she is in Paris, France. Oh! Well, then we drive to France. You can't drive to France, Walter. Yeah. It's way too far. Then maybe we should travel by map! Good idea, Fozzie. ALL: Yeah! (PEOPLE SHOUTING IN FRENCH) (GASPING) (SPEAKING FRENCH) ALL: To Paris! Paris! Paris! WALTER: Look at these ceilings! FOZZIE: Yeah. They must be very tall here. KERMIT: Yeah, very nice. Uh, hi there. Uh, excuse me. Uh, miss? Uh, pardon me, ma'am? Hi there! Uh, we're here to see Miss Piggy, and it's urgent. Mmm-hmm. Urgent! Urgent! Is it urgent? Very. Yes. Let's have a look then, shall we? She has an opening in early September. Early September? That's like six months from now! That's nothing. Once I waited a whole year for September. She is the plus-size editor. She's a huge deal and extremely busy. You can't just pop in without an appointment. Oh. Okay, then. Thank you. WOMAN: All right. ANIMAL: Mean lady. Close the door on your way out. KERMIT: Thanks a lot. She wasn't very nice. KERMIT: Yeah. (SPEAKING FRENCH) Guys! Muppet Man! Huh? Yeah! Huh? (ALL MURMURING) That could work! (KNOCKING) Hello. (MUPPETS GROANING) I have an appointment. Oh. Okay. Um, will you wait here a moment? MISS PIGGY: Decisions, decisions. Eeny, meeny, miny, mo. I choose you. (LAUGHS) (CHEWING) Mademoiselle Cochonnet? Can't you see I'm busy? Of course. There's a, um, man here to see you. He does have an appointment. An appointment? That's weird. Well, why didn't you say so? Send him in! Right away. Sorry. (LAUGHS) Remember, left foot, right foot. Hello. Whoa! Oh, what? (GLASS SHATTERS) Oop, sorry. That looked expensive. Wah! Whoa! Oh! (SIGHS) You look familiar. So do you! Whoa! Please, have a seat. Yes, we're going to have a seat now. No, no, no, don't sit down! Oh, sorry! Whoa! Uh-oh! Message to head. Left leg in trouble! Going down. Left leg going down! What? Oh!

Mmm. Kissy-kissy, mmm-mmm. Wait! What am I doing? I promised myself I'd never go back! I am woman! I am strong! You must leave at once! (SPEAKS FRENCH) Okay. No, no, wait, wait! Miss Piggy! The Muppet Studios are in danger. In danger? Our studios? Kermit! It's true, Piggy. And we need to do The Muppet Show again. We need you. Oh. Before I decide anything, I need to talk with you, frog. (SPEAKING FRENCH) Alone. Piggy? Last time we were together, I said some things I regret. No. No, Kermit. You were just being honest. You never intended to marry me. Not even after I built us a house where we could raise tadpoles and grow old together. Well, who do you think's been looking after that house all these years, huh? Piggy, why do you have to always be so overdramatic about things? You know, it leaves me no choice but to do things that hurt you. I am who I am. Why can't you accept that about me? Look, this is not about you and me. It's never about you and me, is it? It's always "we." "We" this, "we" that. "We need you." You can't even say, "I need you," can you? Piggy, uh... I'm sorry, Kermit, but I have a life here. A life I've made for myself. Oh. Piggy! Just remember, Kermit, I cannot be replaced. Kermit? What happened? Where's Miss Piggy? She's not coming, Fozzie. (ALL GASPING) But, Kermit, we always worked together. We can't do this without Miss Piggy. No one would give us a show without her. We'll be fine, Fozzie. We'll be fine. We just... We'll just have to come up with something else. (SIGHS) Kermie. Hmm... KERMIT: Okay, I've got an idea. We need a pig that can sing. FOZZIE: But, Kermit, who could possibly replace Miss Piggy? (GEORGE THOROGOOD AND THE DESTROYERS' "BAD TO THE BONE" PLAYING) (SCRAPING) Hey, what's everybody so quiet about, huh? Well, she's sorta like Miss Piggy. Come on, everybody. Let's go pitch our telethon and get the Muppets back on TV, okay? No. No. (SPEAKS SPANISH) (ALL GASPING) Oh, my goodness! Oh, that's wonderful! That means "no." (SILENCES) Oh. Uh, come on, guys. Awkward. (ALL SIGH) Listen, Kermit, I like you. I remember you guys from when I was a kid. (ALL MURMURING) So I'm gonna shoot straight. You guys aren't famous anymore. Yeesh! I wish she'd shot a little more curvy. Take a look at this diagram the research department drew up. This circle represents everything that's currently popular. And this tiny speck is you guys. So the answer's no. It's not gonna happen. Take a look at the shows that are popular now. Punch Teacher. Ooh, I love that show. It's time to punch teacher! (ALL CHEERING) HOST: Finish him! It's my favorite. MAN: I just thought I could make a difference. I'm sorry, but in this market, you guys are no longer relevant. Have a good day. (ALL MUMBLING) Before I go, I'd just like to say something. I think kids are smarter and better than all this junk, and if you... Whoa! Veronica, bad news. Punch Teacher has stopped production. It's being sued by the Teachers Society of America. What's their problem? No idea. I just found out. What are we supposed to do with that 120-minute black hole in the schedule coming up in two days? (ALL GASPING) Okay, Muppets. You've got yourselves a show. Oh, yes! (ALL CHEERING) Thank you so much. You will not be sorry, I promise, I promise! Okay, enough! One, no more going nuts in my office. These are new carpets. Yes, ma'am. And two, you need a celebrity host. Okay. Whatever, whatever. Come on, guys, let's go. Yeah! BOBO: Let me wipe that down. DEADLY: You've missed a spot. I don't see it. Just a little lower! Ah! Oh, I am so sorry. Did I get you... Yes. Well, gentlemen. It appears we have some competition on the Muppet property. The Economist says they've gotten back together again. The Muppets got back together? Ooh, ooh, remember? ♪ Together again Gee, it's good to be... ♪ Gentlemen, please! (WHIMPERS) No singing in my office! Yes, sir. But, of course, it was all his fault. Mostly his fault. No matter. Point is that studio and that oil belong to me. Yeah, those Muppets are gonna be running home with their tails between their legs. Some of 'em literally. Because those ones have tails. Maniacal laugh, maniacal laugh. (LAUGHING) That's a maniacal laugh moment. KERMIT: Okay, this is it. '80s Robot, let's park around back. (CHAIN RATTLES) Oh. KERMIT: It's The Muppet Show, with our special guest star, Mr. Bob Hope! (APPLAUSE) ANNOUNCER: Time once again for Veterinarian's Hospital, the continuing story of... And now, Pigs in Space! Gary. Can you believe it? The Muppet Theater. Yeah. Welcome back, everyone. Thanks. Well, I know the old place is not quite at its best right now. Yeah! Who canceled the maid service? (LAUGHS) But don't worry. We'll be fine. Uh, Kermit, there's no way we can rehearse with the place like this. Wait. Kermit, don't say another word. Mary, Walter and I, well, we would be happy to help you rebuild the theater. Honestly, it would be an honor for all three of us. So would. Okay. Well, let's clean this place up! ALL: Yeah! (HUMMING) This is boring. But don't you guys remember? You're the Muppets! You do this to music! Well, all right! (STARSHIP'S "WE BUILT THIS CITY" PLAYING) ♪ We built this city ♪ We built this city on rock and roll ♪ Built this city Hey, Animal! Yeah? Look what I found!

We haven't done this in a long time, and I really don't wanna go back to Reno. Don't worry, Fozzie. We'll be fine. Look how we cleaned this place up today, you know? Same old team, all pulling together. I guess you're right. Night-night, Kermit. Good night, Fozzie. (SIGHS) KERMIT: Okay, gather round, troops! Everybody, time to get this rehearsal going. Scooter, is everybody here? Almost everyone, chief. Yeah... Hey, uh, anybody got any kerosene? I wanna take these old pig dresses out back and burn 'em. MISS PIGGY: Hold it right there, sausage snout! Piggy? Huh? Well, look what the cat dragged in. Come on. Keep it up, Maurice. Sorry, Miss Piggy, but you've been replaced... Permanently. Oh, yeah?

Yeah, well, you ain't seen the last of me! I'll be back! Yeah, yeah. Heard of mouthwash? Welcome back, Miss Piggy. All right, all right, don't crowd me! Wow, she sure hasn't changed. Piggy? You came back. I'm not here for you, Kermit. I'm here for them. (DOOR CLOSES) And besides, when this show's done, I'm catching the next plane back to my life in Paris. Okay, Piggy, okay. Uh, places for the opening number, everybody! (MISS PIGGY GROWLS) KERMIT: Oh, good morning, Veronica. Morning, Frog. Okay, everybody, let's take it from the top. (THEME MUSIC PLAYING) Oh!

(SIGHS) Who's next? ANIMAL: In control. Oh. Hey, Walter? Oh. Uh, yes, Kermit? You think you might wanna help us out here? Maybe do something in the show? Kermit, you know, you've been so nice to me, but I have to face the facts. See, the Muppets are so talented... Hey, guys, check it out! Fart shoes! (FARTING SOUNDS) Patent pending! And... I don't have any talent at all. The truth is... (SIGHS) I can't perform with you guys. I feel like a phony just being here. Walter, just because you haven't found your talent yet, doesn't mean you don't have one. If you look inside yourself, I'm sure you'll find something that you're really good at. Okay, Kermit. I'll try. Oh. WOMAN: Take my picture! Welcome. How many in your party? Two? Uh, no, just the one. (LAUGHS) All right, party of one, follow me.

I've been looking for you everywhere! So nice to see you, Veronica. Who's hosting? Did you find a celebrity? Uh, yeah, well, I've wanted to talk to you about that, you see, because, uh... Well, actually, uh, I'm kind of a celebrity. You? (LAUGHS) No. Kermit, listen. I will not air the show unless you find a real celebrity host. I will rerun Benson if I have to. Yeah, you see, the thing is, Veronica, that's kind of impossible because the show's in 12 hours! Twelve hours! I might as well just go and ask Tex Richman to give us the studio back! KERMIT: And the Muppets are like a big family. Well... And for us, that theater is... Is like our home, um, which is why, in conclusion, we humbly ask that you give us back our studio. It would certainly mean a lot to us. Uh... Hmm.

You see, Muppets, according to this contract, it's not just this studio you lose the rights to tonight, it's the Muppet name itself. What? And all characters under the Muppet name. Wait a second. What possible use could you have for our names? (BEEPING) Told ya I'd be back. Well, now I am back. And I see you've met Mr. Richman, our new business partner. The Moopets are a hard, cynical act for a hard, cynical world. Hey, Fozzie! I want you to meet a friend of mine. (MOOPETS LAUGHING) Wocka wocka. You're relics, Muppets! The world has moved on, and no one cares about your goody-goody, hippy-dippy, Julie Andrews and Dom DeLuise hostin', singin'-and-dancin' act anymore! You're dead! (GASPING) And I just come to bury you. Now, get out of my office. What? What is that supposed to mean? You said you were gonna talk to the man! Guys! Okay, so maybe Kermit signed away the theater and the Muppet name, but as long as we have a celebrity host, we can still pull off a heartwarming, last-minute triumph, right, Kermit? Uh, well, uh, actually I don't see how we can, Fozzie. Huh? Guys, the show's in six hours, and we're barely rehearsed, and, well, uh, I... I couldn't get us a celebrity host. Oh, no! What? (SIGHS) I'm afraid Tex Richman's right. The world's moved on. I'm sorry I dragged you guys into this mess. Kermit? All right, listen up, you freaks! I didn't come 5,000 miles to not be on TV. All we need is one stinkin' celebrity, and by any means necessary. Now, the frog's gone. We're doing things my way from now on. Let's move! (CAR ALARM SOUNDING) Hey! Hi. How was your day? Oh, it was great. I went to Guinness Book of World Records... Alone. Then Ripley's Believe It Or Not... Solo. And then I ate lunch unaccompanied. And then I walked back here... Independently. Listen, um, I got you these. You know, to make up for the other ones. The broken ones. Thanks, sweetie. Listen, Gary. Yeah. I was just wondering what the plan was for dinner tonight. Oh, I don't care. What do you feel like? Okay. That's fine. That's just fine. That's, um... That's perfect. I'm going to go for a walk. Individually. (WHISTLING) (HUMMING) Walter, hey. Oh, Gary. Oh, where have you been? Look, I need you to help me figure out a talent. A talent for what? For the show. Kermit asked me to do an act in the show. I... I could be a Muppet. Wow. Wow, Walter, that's amazing. Yeah, but, uh, I need to figure out if I have a talent. Well, um, you know what? I'm sure you'll think of something, but right now I actually... I need your help. Um... I'm starting to get the feeling that Mary's upset with me about something, and I don't know what, and I was hoping maybe you would talk to her for me. Gary, I'd love to help you out, but I can't leave the theater now. This is important. Well, hold on a second. I mean, my life is important, too. Yeah, but the whole reason we came here was to see The Muppets. No, it wasn't! The whole reason we came here was to take a vacation where I took Mary out to a fancy dinner because it's our 10th anniversary, and then... Walter, what day is today? Uh, Friday. Yeah. Yeah, that's it. This is bad. Walter, this is really bad. I have to... Mary? Mary! Wait. Gary, I need you. Okay, is everybody ready? Commence Operation Celebri-nap. Masks on! ALL: Masks on!

Kermit, listen. Whatever I may think of you right now, these guys are counting on you. You inspire them. What, to kidnap people? To work together. To kidnap people? Mr. The Frog, we all agreed a celebrity is not a people. And now that we have a celebrity, the show's back on. Come on, Kermit. Don't let these guys down now. All right.

We need one last act to bring us home. I'm gonna go check on Jack Black and see if he has any ideas. You guys see if you can come up with something. We have two minutes! Two minutes! Think, think, think! FOZZIE: What am I thinking? Walter. Walt! Walter! Gary? Wha... You came back. Walter. What are you doing down here? They just need one more act. You gotta get out there and help those guys. I can't. What if people laugh at me? I... I'd rather go back home to Smalltown. With you. Look, Walter, you're my brother, and I'm always gonna love you, but you belong here, with these guys. Hey, you're the one who got Kermit to do this. You're the one who brought everyone here together. You always believe in other people, but that's easy. Sooner or later, you gotta believe in yourself, too, because that's what growing up is. It's becoming who you want to be. You have to try. Please, Walter. You're my hero. (MURMURING) (BELL DINGS) Okay, Jack Black's got nothing. What did you guys come up with? Uh, Bunsen can set Beaker on fire. No, no, no, we can't do that. I could break out the fart shoes. No, no, no, that will never work! We're back in three, two... (BELL DINGS) Oh, no! (WHISTLING) Huh? (WHISTLING MOURNFUL TUNE) It's Walter. (ORCHESTRAL MUSIC PLAYING) (WHISTLING) (SONG ENDS) (APPLAUSE) Thank you. He's all grown up. Oh, that was wonderful! (BELL DINGS) KERMIT: Ladies and gentlemen, Walter! It looks like we're going to get our studio back! This just in. The Muppets are about to take back their studio. (CAR STARTS) (TIRES SCREECH) '80S ROBOT: Help! I've been mugged. Alerting authorities. RECORDED VOICE: We're sorry... What happened? Hello? Hello? Guys, my phone is dead. News flash! My phone is also dead. Repeat, my phone is also dead. Ooh! (GROANING) I did it. (GRUNTS) I beat you. Game over, Kermit. You lost. Aw. Chicky! Too late, Muppets. I won! Turn that thing off! The show is over! (AUDIENCE GASPS) Ah! But we were so close! (WINDING DOWN) (ALL GASP) (ALL GROAN) Or not. It kinda makes me feel better, honestly. I mean, we were nowhere close at all. You artists formerly known as the Muppets are standing on private property. My private property. And I'm telling you to leave. Now! Ooh. (WHIMPERS) He's right, everybody. He won. We gotta go. (SIGHS) (FARTING NOISES) ROWLF: Ah, not now, Fozzie. I can't believe this. I know. Well, that's that. This isn't right. It can't end like this. But what can we do? Uh... (CLEARS THROAT) Listen, everybody, we've got nothing to be ashamed of. And you know why? Well, because thanks to Walter here, we tried. And if we failed, we failed together, and to me, that's not failing at all. And I don't care what anybody says. And I don't care if no one believes in us, because I believe. I believe in you. Huh? Ah. And you. Me? And you. You know, what's important isn't this building or a name. It's each other. So I say, fine, let's just start at the bottom and work our way back up to the top. ALL: Yeah. Let's all walk out through these doors with our heads held high. As a family. Because that's what we are. ALL: Yeah. Yeah. (CHEERING) (GASPING) (CHANTING) Muppets, Muppets, Muppets! (CHANTING) Muppets, Muppets, Muppets! (LAUGHS) All right. Wow. Wow. (LAUGHS) Hey, where's Walter? See? Your fans, they love you guys! Hey, Walter. Aren't you gonna join us? FOZZIE: Yeah! Come on! ROWLF: Come on, Walter! Come on, Walter! Yes. Come! What're you waiting for, buddy? Get over there. Yeah, go ahead. (CHEERING) CROWD: (CHANTING) Muppets! Muppets! Muppets! (PLAYING PIANO) Hmm? Oh. How charming. A finale.
