(moody rock and roll music) (distant chatter) (girls scream) (girls scream) (girls scream) (girls scream) (girls scream) (brooding music) (indistinct chatter from announcer) [Announcer] I now direct your attention to the platform to your immediate right where Madam Sonya, the foremost hypnotic hypnotologist of our time will demonstrate her utter control of nature's deadliest and most lonesome creatures, snakes alive! That's all you got in here? Ain't you got no geek or nothin'? No, the law won't allow it. We've got something better in there. Ladies and gentlemen, you're about to behold a sight so strange, so horrifying, so utterly monstrous, that I urge those of you who are easily frightened or upset, who suffer from the nervous disorders, weak hearts or queasy stomachs, who experience nightmares, and any children under the age of 16 years to forego witnessing this exhibit. There are only two kinds of freaks, ladies and gentlemen. Those created by God and those made by man. The creature in this pit is a living, breathing human being that once was, but that's another story that happened a long time ago, a long way from here. Look, if you must. (peaceful guitar music) [Man] Give me my check, Jade. More coffee? No, I've had enough, thanks. Say, Jade? I was thinkin'. Maybe you'd like to go to a movie or somethin'? Some night after you get off work? Some other time, maybe. Well, I guess I'd better get goin'. I got the right change. Yes, sir. Thank you kindly. (chuckles) You sure don't give those rednecks the time of day, do you? Now, don't get me wrong, Jade. I like that in my gals. Not messing around with the paying customers. You know... I had this one pig. Betty June. She used to take on every mother's son that come through the door. (Chuckles) Yeah, you told me about her 25 times. Well, then Betty June, you know, God bless her. Some weeks she took in as much as I did. - Much as all that, huh? - Yeah. Why now, that's enough to tempt a girl into a life of sin. Jade? Lucile went up to Coleman to visit her mother. What do you say you and me, we go over to Lee County tonight for a couple of beers, huh? (giggles) Gee, Greasy. That sounds groovy. But I'm afraid I don't have anything classy enough to wear for such a grand occasion. Don't you get so damn snotty! Who the hell do you think you are anyway? I know who I am. I'm nobody. Just like you. (suspenseful music) And I know somethin' else, too. If I'm ever gonna be somebody, I'm wasting my time in this filth pit. And that goes for anybody who comes in here! And that includes the married owner. You're talking yourself right out of a job, girl. You know that? Fire me. Who else round here would work for you? Especially for what you pay. Well, you get to keep all the tips, don't ya? (laughs) Oh, big deal! I'll retire next week on them tips! Well, what do you want, Jade? Do you know yourself? (suspenseful music) No. But I know what I don't want. I don't wanna wind up like my momma did. My daddy used to say that she was the prettiest girl in West Texas. A tired old woman now. 42 years old and she's a tired old woman! They've been married 25 years, and you know what she's got to show for it? Nine kids. None of us even been to high school. 160 acres of mortgaged dust, a $5 wedding band, and $100 burial policy. No, sir. Oh, there's gotta be somethin' better than that. I don't know what or where it is, but when Ifind it, I'm gonna get it. Even if I have to lie or beg or cheat or steal for it, I'm gonna get it. For Jade Cochran. You keep talking like that, girl, you're gonna get in trouble. Where you goin'? Not as far as I'd like to. (sullen music) (car door slams) Customer comin'. [Greasy] Yes, sir. Come right on in. Hey, I don't need a reservation, do I? (Greasy laughs) [Jade] You wanna see a menu? Don't need it, darlin'. Just give me a grilled cheese, a cup of black coffee, and a piece of pie. - Sandwich coming right up. - Thanks, darlin'. You come far today? All the way from Jonesborough. - Here you are, my friend. - Another grilled great one. Hey, that looks good! Let's see if that can pass the acid test. - Mm. - (chuckles) Good? Not bad. Are you the boss? Proprietor, general manager and chief chef. Well, look, I'm an advance man for a carnival show coming in and it's being sponsored by your legion. Would you do me a favor? Would you mind putting this card up somewhere in here? Look, it's for the legion! Well, I guess that's the least I can do for a customer. And for the legion. (laughs) - Hey, how about that? - I sure appreciate it. (Greasy chuckles) More coffee? Please, young lady. I guess you get to see a whole lot of the country. Well, traveling with the shows, I mean. Yeah, that's the one say you can say about it. You get to see the country. Have you been a showman long? For as long as I can remember, honey. Even longer, I think. [Greasy] Jade, don't forget to give him his pie. Excuse me, I'll get your pie. Oh, thank you. Thank you. Is there any jobs for girls around the show? (chuckles) Oh, I can't sing or dance or anything like that, but if there's work, I'm used to it. Why? Husband? Boyfriend problem? - Family, Mom and Dad? - No. - It's a rugged life. - What ain't? Look. The show will get in late Sunday evening. Monday, go to the office wagon. Ask for Al Babcock. Now, you tell him Ben Thomas sent you. Ben Thomas. Everything all right, old buddy? My compliments to the chef. Would you let me have the tab, please, honey? You all come back soon now, hear? Thanks very much for putting that poster up. Mr. Thomas? It is Mr. Babcock? Al Babcock. Thanks. Thanks very much, Mr. Thomas. Please, don't thank me! I didn't even know if there's anything open on the show, honey. And I surely don't know why a pretty young girl like you wants to get with it. But it's your life. Look, if that's what you want, then be with it. For it. I'll see ya. (brooding music) You're gonna run off and join that lousy carnival, huh? Too good to work for me here, huh? What the hell you going to do on the carnival, Jade? You gonna dance the hoochie coochie? Show the farm boys what you got? Maybe you're gonna have your own concession, hm? Take on the roister boys every night? (slap) (poster tears) You get outta here, you carnival tramp. I don't want you givin' my customers no disease. You know where you're going, girl? You're going down. You're going all the way down. You're going to hell. From here, it's all the way up. (suspenseful music) (upbeat rock & roll music) (hammering clinks) (hammering clinks) (background chatter) (upbeat jazz music) [Carny] And get yours right over here. (background chatter) (distant screams) Country fried and mashed potato's today's special. Where else can a poor working girl get a hot lunch? On this show, they've got you by the hunger pangs. When'd you come on? - What? - How long you been with it? First time out, eh? When did you join our happy carefree gypsy caravan? Yesterday. Well, honey, I don't know what you did before, but you've got the roughest gofers around one of these things. (Jade chuckles) Listen, it's no worse than the last place, and the customers are a lot nicer. I'm Pat Mullins. My friends call me Moon. You call me Moon. Moon, moon. Wasn't he in the funny papers? Ain't it awful? You got a moniker? Me moon, you? (chuckles) Jade Cochran. You know, I guess I never will understand all this crazy talk. Honey, in two weeks you'll be cracking carny with the best of 'em. Stay with them for the route and you'll never speak English again. What do you do in the show, Moon? My girl, I'll have you know you are now serving the feature attraction of the fabulous Broadway Hollywood Revue. Direct to you from the Lido Beach Club in Sarasota, Florida. The inevitable Miss Ginger Hale. The little lady who puts it on, takes it off, rolls it out and wraps it up and throws it right at ya. You mean you strip in front of a bunch of guys? - As much as the law allows. - (Jade chuckles) Well, I guess whether it's in front of one or 100, it's all the same. Hey, how about some service over here? Big shot ride foreman, god's gift to women. Yeah, well, I'll get to him. Excuse me. I didn't see you waiting. Sorry. Forgive me for interrupting the meeting of the ladies' AIDS society but I only got 30 minutes to grab a meal. I said I was sorry! How's the special today? (man snorts) I hear it's good. (Chuckles) Okay. You want anything else, Moon? Couldn't take it. Can't take that roughie, either. The Ferris wheel man? He doesn't seem like such a bad guy, once you get to know him. What's his name? Blackie Fleming and if you want some advice, don't get to know him. Showtime, gotta cut. Say, Jade, where are you staying? I make a motel every spot. If you wanna split the privilege, you're more than welcome. It sure beats sleeping in the back of a truck. Gee, thanks. Sounds swell. Meet me at the girls show. See ya. Bye. Well, Max, you finally a waitress who's with it. Best broad I've had in three season. Sure hope she stays. Treat her right and she will stay. I treat 'em all right. You must treat the Board of Health right. (chuckles) Yeah. Kid, you're really with it. Take an hour break. We feed again at five. Thanks, Max. (upbeat jazz music) (indistinct chatter from announcer) (indistinct chatter from announcer) (suspenseful music) [Jade] Pat! What's the matter, honey? Honey, what's the matter? You look shook. I just saw 'em. Who, the crowd? The freaks? So? They're so horrible. Honey, God made 'em the way they are. They're better off around here than most places. Why do they have to be anywhere? [Man] Hey, Moon, you're on! Just wait here. I'll be back in a minute. (lively striptease music) (audience cheers and applaud) (Jade applauds) Bring your stuff and I'll meet you back at the hotel after the show slows. Gee, Moon, I sure appreciate you letting me room with you. Man, this is nice. You know, I've never been in a real motel or hotel room before. You know, I knowed it. I knowed it all along. Knew what, honey? That there had to be something better than what I had. Or could look forward to. Rough, huh? Carnies don't pry in anybody's past. You're with it, you belong. Why you're here or what you did before, that's your business. - Moon. - Huh? I ain't prying, but- - But you were wondering about me, being a stripper, right? [Jade] Well, sort of. Well, no big deal. When the frost is on the pumpkin, I'm grinding away on the Brody circuit. Then come summertime, I get itchy feet and go out and carny it up. I'm a veteran now. Three seasons. Hey, Moon, you ever think about getting married? - I've thought about it. - Matter of fact, I did it once. It worked? Almost a whole year. A musician. Young, wild, good lookin'. Drank everything, smoked everything. Everything. I didn't bring back memories, Moon? - [Pat] No memories, honey. - I've almost forgotten his name. Moon? [Pat] Yeah, honey? You don't think very much of Blackie Fleming. Why? [Pat] He's a nothing guy. Oh, he's not bad looking and he knows it, but what's the percentage of getting involved with a ride boy? All you'll get from him is something you don't want or need. Well... Are there any nice fellas around the show? Not married. You're turning already? [Jade] Aww, Moon, don't make fun of me. I'm not making fun of you, Jade. I'm with you. A girl'd be a fool not to keep eyes and ears open. Well, which ones of 'em is prosperous? Hey, you are getting with it. Well, let's take stock. The concessionaires do pretty good. [Jade] They don't look like the marrying kind, though. Nothing wrong with your perception. Well, Mr. Babcock, he's loaded. But been married 100 years. The old man in the wagon and he's a bachelor, but he's been that way too long to start retraining him. None of the roughies have anything or ever will. Pete Murray, my boss. Ah, he's a lush. Steve St. John. Who? - [Pat] Steve St. John. - He owns the 10 in 1. The what? [Pat] The 10 in 1! The freak show. Oh. Oh, I ain't met him yet. Brightest guy in the show. In his 40s and nice lookin'. Owns a home in Tampa, wife died four or five years ago. No children. Drives a big car. Travels all over when the show's off the road. Well, I wanna meet this Mr. Steve St. John. Yeah, surely do. (eerie music) When I find it, I'm gonna get it. Even if I have to lie or beg or cheat or steal for it, I'm gonna get it. For Jade Cochran. (men laugh) You oughta see the way ol Blackie livin' in DC today. Listen, I don't take nothin' off nobody. On this rag bag or any other. Hell, Old Man Freeman over in United Shows? He's been after me all season to come on. Yeah, be his ride superintendent. In charge of the whole lot. (men laugh) And that's 12 rides. So how come you ain't there instead of here? Or do you think Babcock can run his show without you? (men laugh) You know what I said to Babcock the other day? Oh, yeah. (Chuckles) "Yes, sir, Mr. Babcock!" (men laugh) (tense music) Pretty-Boy! Now you got 32 teeth, you wanna try for 16? Sure you're big enough, Fleming? One of these days, Pretty-Boy, it's gonna be you and me! That your best hope, Fleming? Oh, simmer it down, Blackie! He was only jokin'! Hey, don't start him, Pretty-Boy! Break it up, fellas, break it up. [Man] Hey, you guys eye the new broad waiting table in the grab joint? [Man] Yeah, how about that? I just might have to stake out that little country girl for myself. (Laughs) Oh, she's already been staked out, Pretty-Boy. So you better go find yourself another location. (tense music) Well, now, Mr. Fleming. We all know you're a real big wheel around this show. But if I decide to take a shot at that little hash-slinging yokel, I ain't gonna bother asking you. And I just decided! (dramatic music) (grunting) (suspenseful music) (groans) (dramatic music) (grunting) (thuds) (Blackie groans) (slaps) (ominous piano chord) (brooding guitar music) (suspenseful music) (groans) - Everything quiet, Red Eye? - All quiet, Mr. Babcock. See that broad? If I was Babcock, I'd run her off faster than the joint guy swallows a scrag. Yeah, why? 'Cause she's trouble, that's why. What's she done? She only come on this week. You saw what happened last night with Blackie and Pretty-Boy. I don't know what she had to do with that. She wasn't even there. (background chatter) - Hi. - Hi. That's Steve St. John just came in with Mr. Babcock. Excuse me. I've got to wait on those gentlemen. Good morning, Mr. Babcock. Morning, Mr. St. John. - Good morning, Jade. - You've met Steve St. John? What can I get you gentlemen? - Just coffee, black. - Same. Yes, sir. (brooding guitar music) Where'd she come from, Al? Oh just a little country gal looking for something better. Big game hunting? More cat and mouse. (upbeat jazz music) (horns honk) (door closes) Pat. I didn't know we had company. Hi, honey. Come in and meet my friend Jane Moore. Otherwise known as the Mysterious Madam Olga. Olga has the mid-camp. The mid-camp? Come, let Madam Olga tell your past, your present and your future. The palm of your own hand reveals all. (Jade laughs) I'm sure pleased to meet ya. I've seen your fortune telling tent on the midway. I was going in myself. Yeah, Olga makes her fortune telling others theirs. Now, Moon, you know I'm just a hard-working widow woman trying to make a small score in this cold, hard world. Oh, sure! Did you have a nice time tonight? Things are progressin'. Steve St. John? Olga, we may just be in the presence of the greatest carny of them all! One week with it and... Jade, you really are a worker. I project a great future for this little country girl. Now, Moon, you lay off the predictions, and I'll stop doing the cooch. Don't listen to these quacks, Jade. Let an expert advise you. Give me your mitt. Your hand! It won't cost you. You're with the show. A very strong head line. This little girl knows what she wants. And is going to get it. (eerie music) I never saw anything like that. What is it, Olga? What do you see? Your life line. What do you mean? It stops, suddenly. And then it starts all over again. And then it goes on, almost forever. Well, that's not hard to figure. No, ma'am! No, I'm starting a whole new life. And I ain't gonna remember the old one. (upbeat rock & roll music) Thanks. You're welcome. What're you gonna be doing later? I really couldn't say. I have several invitations- - Okay, I'll see you later. (sullen music) Come on in, I'll pour us a drink. (Jade laughs) In where? In my joint. I got it all to myself. It's warm. Dry. And cozy. Sounds charming. (laughs) Oh, this is delightful. (Chuckles) Utterly delightful! Well, now who do you think you are? You come from any better? No. But my sights are set a lot higher. Listen, chick, you think I'm another gazoony? You think I ain't got something going for me? You think I ain't got some stash swallowed, huh? Oh, I don't know, but that don't look like no Caddy to me that you were drivin'. You're gonna take that sucker St. John down the line with Maggie Cline, huh? (Jade laughs) (slaps) (ominous tones) (thud) (eerie psychedelic music) (distant announcements) (crickets chirp) (ominous orchestral music) (sultry jazz music) (upbeat jazz music) (horns honk) (distant screams) (distant screams) [Steve] Hey. - You're kidding! - (group laughs) Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. (sultry jazz music) (warm organ music) (upbeat rock & roll music) [Steve] Good mornin', Mrs. St. John. Good mornin', Mr. St. John. (both chuckle) Just what is tickling the bride on the first mornin'? (Jade giggles) I knowed it. I knowed it all along. - You knew what? - (Jade chuckles) That's my secret. Secrets from your husband already, huh? (both chuckle) Oh, wow. Enough of this mad love-making, witch. I gotta get out to the lot! Or this week's gonna be a red one. But if you'll get out of the Kip, I'll order up breakfast for two and we'll make the chef deal out the plates. Room service, please. (wolf whistles) Oh, sorry. This is Mr. St. John, room 365. (sultry jazz music) Two orange juices and, uh... Two scrambled eggs. And bacon. And, uh... Toast. Butter. Jam. And uh, uh... Coffee. Lots of coffee. No hurry. (upbeat jazz music) (Jade chuckles) (Jade laughs) (ominous tones) (upbeat jazz music) (distant screams) (sultry jazz music) I'll take three. [Max] Three. - Charlie? - I'll pass. One to the dealer. Okay, Al. $20. I call. Your dub and one more. (men chuckle) How's it going? Fabulous, but I think it'll get better. (men laugh) Will you be much longer, honey? You getting sleepy? Al little. Well, baby, take the car, drive on back to the motel and get some sleep. Al can bring me by when we break up. - Right, All? - Sure, Steve. You won't be too late, will ya? Oh, no, no. Another hour or two at the most. Well, goodnight, gentlemen. I hope you all win. [Max] (chuckles) Goodnight, Jade. Goodnight, darlin'. I won't be late, I promise. You've got yourself a great little broad there, Steve. - You gotta get lucky somewhere. - This sure ain't my game. (men chuckle) (suspenseful music) Hey, where you goin'? Hey! (suspenseful music) I asked you where you're going. None of your business where I'm going, Blackie. Why don't you flake off? (Blackie chuckles) You know, if I had a good looking wife like you, she wouldn't be wandering around the lot at night by herself. Of course, you could be lookin' for somethin'. Somethin' special. Somethin' you probably can't get nowhere else. (suspenseful music) (suspenseful music) - Well, now, Shorty. - What're you doing back here? You're supposed to be inside looking after my interests. Mr. St. John, I gotta talk to you. I gotta tell you something. Good mornin', darlin'. Good mornin' to you, Shorty. Dear. Hi, sweetheart. I didn't wake you up last night when I came in, did I? I'll talk you later, Mr. St. John. You know, he doesn't like me. Oh, Jade, you're imagining things. Shorty likes everybody. He gives me the creeps! They all do. Oh, honey, they're my friends. They're human beings, just like you and me. They're not like me, they're not! I'm no freak! Okay. Okay, you're no freak. But just remember I make my living exhibiting them. I'd rather you ran an insane asylum. It's the kindest home any of them ever had being on the show. Some come from parents who were cruel or ashamed of having produced a child unlike others. Here, they have an opportunity to be self-supporting in a world which has rejected them, simply because physically they're abnormal. And they're with others just like themselves. Oh, you just feel sorry for them. No. That's one thing they don't want, or need. Pity. Yeah, had a kid come on once. No arms and no legs. So full of self-pity, it oozed out of his ears. You know what I said to him? "Look, fella. You think you're the only handicapped person in the world? Well, stop sitting there feeling sorry for yourself. I'm a man and you're a man, and we both gotta make a livin'. Now get up on that platform and do your stuff." He did it. And he's still with it and for it and doin' okay. Your story's touched my heart. [Steve] I told you, Jade, they're my friends. They're disgusting. (upbeat jazz music) Okay, Shorty. Okay, I'll be with you in a minute. Excuse me a second, Al. Shorty's got something important to tell me that won't wait. Sure, Steve. Go ahead. Okay, short stuff, this better be important. What is it? (slap) (sullen music) Shorty, wait. (phone rings) (suspenseful music) (knocks) (knocks) What do you want? [Blackie] The same thing you do, Mrs. St. John. (suspenseful music) (dramatic music) (knife clacks) [Sergeant] We grabbed him trying to hitch a ride near the county line and brought him back last night. Prints are all over the knife. He's already confessed. It's all wrapped up. You'll have to appear at a trial, Mrs. St. John. Mr. Babcock has already given us your route, so, we'll notify you. Thank you very much for your cooperation, and my deepest sympathies. Miss Mullins. Now, if you ladies will excuse me, I'll arrange for your transportation back to the motel. Thank you, Sergeant. Did... Did Steve have any other relatives that should be notified? Look, honey, why don't you take off for a week? If you like, I'll go with you. I'm sure Pete will let me have the time. We could go down to Tampa. Steve has... You have a house there, you know. You've never even seen it. You could rest up, get straightened out. It'd do you a world of good. And who's gonna run my show? (moody guitar music) (car door slams) Shorty! Come around back. I wanna talk to you. (suspenseful music) Wait, Jane. I just heard something. News sure travels fast around this lot, doesn't it? Look, it's none of my business, but did you have to run him off? He's been with Steve for 12 years! This is the only home he has. Like you said... None of your business. You know, I'm beginning to be sorry I ever met you. Look, cooch. I don't need you or anybody else to tell me how to run my business. Why don't you screw on back to the girly show and shake it for the payin' customers? I'm glad Steve never knew what a real Larry broad you are. (suspenseful music) (music intensifies) (woman screams) [Announcer] There are only two kinds of freaks, ladies and gentlemen. Those created by God and those made by men. I guess both of them had a hand in what you see here. (eerie music) (Greasy laughs) (dark music) (eerie music)
