So spooky. Ugh, why is this the perfect Halloween movie? God, I hate school so much. They're still on the Dewey Decimal System? But they have that statue, so we're-- That's truly insane. What middle school has that kind of money? Funnel it into the light department, because they need some lights. Yeah, you would see the light's off and you would go home. - Hello? - You would just leave. You would see the light's off and you would go: "Time to go home." Mrs. Westerberg? Oh, I love this part. Me too. Oh, my God. Here we go, here we go. What the... You go home. No, no. You accept your destiny. I would have gone home. - It's too late. - No. No, no. You leave. Just leave. Hmm. It's too late, now. I love this. Oh, God. Hope you like strawberries. Mm. Hah. This strawberry makes your eyes glow. Oh. Oh! Hi, uh, Kimberley. Th-th-this is Mark. Kimberley. Y-your mom's told me a lot about you. How was school? Fine. Um, I thought you were supposed to help Mrs. Westerberg in the library today. She wasn't there. Can I go? Oh, uh... we're having meatloaf! You know I hate meatloaf. Should I go? I love that '90s magic only works in dark dangerous weather conditions. I love this. Oh, my God, she even sleeps convincingly. Movie magic. For the time, you know what I mean? Hi, Kimberley. Do you like this more than Just Add Water? Um, yes. Of course. -Don't you? -I don't know. Just Add Water is really good. But this is just better. Hmm-mmm. Kimberley, how was school? Hey, I-I have something for you. Just, uh, stay right there, okay? Don't move a muscle. I thought you might like this. It was mine growing up. That glove was his growing up? It was, like, brand new. Thought we might... have a catch. She wants to spit on him. Okay, he's not not hot. I love World Wide Witch. I know you do. You know, Cher was supposed to be the mermaid queen in Just Add Water. I do know. You say that every time. That would have been amazing. My sister used to watch that every day. I think that's actually how I found out about Amanda Campbell. I saw World Wide Witch in theaters on opening weekend before anyone was even talking about Amanda Campbell. Oh, my God. Okay, shh. Shut up, shut up. Sorry. She's not here. Let's just go home. Kimberley, wait. I thought I lost you forever. Kimberley, I have to go now. No, you can't. The spell is wearing off. I have to go back into the computer. No, you can't. I won't let you. Please. I need you. No, you don't, Kimberley. Not anymore. I love you. I love you too. -Kimberley. -Yeah? Good luck in sixth grade. Hey, Kimberley. Good luck in sixth grade. You bet, Mark. "You bet, Mark." This movie makes me so happy. You don't look happy. -She was really talented. -Yeah. Hey, guys. Welcome back. Thanks for joining us for the Amanda Campbell's Crash and Burn Marathon. This weekend, all weekend, we are celebrating our favorite loose cannon, Amanda Campbell. So, we just witnessed her star turn in World Wide Witch, and now we're going chronological with her big splash: Just Add Water. But first, we have a few recent developments. And these are too good to ignore. As you know, former child star Amanda Campbell was seen in New York City this week wreaking havoc. No! No! I love it. It's like watching a train crash in slow motion. It's crazy they're still dragging her through the mud. Yeah. Guys, she was seen punching a paparazzo on Sunday night. And just last night, she was seen passed out at a club at 2:00 a.m. Yikes. Oooh, looks like all that time spent in rehab was for nothing. Sorry Amanda! Boo! Maybe the fifth time's a charm? Maybe not. Her career is over. Oh, let her be. Her career is not over. Let's see, four years ago was her last movie, and since then she's done two cameos as herself. So she's struggling, yes. But that just means someone needs to help her. Like, someone should do something. We watched Celebrity Intervention. Yes. And it is the celebrity lifestyle that is keeping her in this vicious circle. I... don't think it's her fault, if that's what you mean. People want to watch her fail. I don't know, I... I feel like if somebody showed her, like, a simpler, more relaxed, like, lifestyle, she would come out of the-- this whole thing on the other side just completely fine. Are you talking about our simple relaxed lifestyle? Well, no, but-- Frozen waffles and friendship probably wouldn't do a lot for her. Okay. All right, everybody. We are dying to hear what you have to say about Amanda Campbell's deeply personal struggle with substance abuse. Tell us what you think on our website, on every single one of our social media platforms. Text us or call our 24-hour hotline. And we'll be right back with Just Add Water. I wasn't saying we would save her. I'm just saying someone should do something. I'm sure there are people who care about her and are worried about her and want her to get better. I don't know. Addiction is a disease, and... Oh. Yes. You're right. I'm sorry, Dom. I wasn't-- I-I'm sorry but... All right, well, I'm going to head out. Wait, what? Where are you going? I'm going out. I told you. -No, you didn't. -Yeah. Janet and Ian want to hang out with me before I go back to school. Janet's starting her new job and Ian is going to the Cape with his parents, so, last chance. But Just Add Water is on next. I have to see my other friends. You leave for school in, like, three weeks. Yeah, and I'll be here every day until then. Yeah, but that doesn't mean we get to hang out. Are you kidding me? We hang out together every day, alone. And I love that, but people think I'm dead. Got to go. Okay. Yeah, that's fine. -Yeah? -Yeah. Say hi to 'em for me. Do you want to come? They hate me. All right. Yeah. I love you. I love you, too. I need my magical seashell. If you give it back to me, you will be paid-- With what? With this other magical seashell that can see into the future. Oh, okay. All right. Okay, pause. Shh. They met through their agent. Oh, she was, like, summoned to his office. Ugh. That's a weird way to get a wife. Could you? -What? -Phone. Okay. Oh, it's your dad. Hey. Chloe. Just calling to check. I know you haven't forgotten about tonight. I'm down a driver and I need you to take limo five's booking, okay? Okay. Please just show up, please don't be late, and please just wear the uniform. Can I rely on you this time? No, yeah. That's fine. Okay, bye. -Working tonight? -Yep. Bachelor party in N.Y.C., baby. Oh, fun. It's going to be wild. I'm not coming with you this time. Okay, help. Hang on. Choosing an elective. Advanced Action Painting. Sounds good. 23 down, four letters. -Kismet? -Fate. Oh, right. Yeah, duh. Thanks. Is it supposed to rain? No. Do you know when they're coming out? I don't know, maybe like another hour or so. Okay. Or, maybe now. Hide. Take me to the hotel. Can we go? God, I don't want to be here anymore. Get out of the car. No. Go away! Um... Miss Amanda Campbell, I-I think that, um, you may have the wrong car. Just drive. Drive! Okay. Put the thing up. Absolutely. Now! -Oh, my God. -Oh, my God. Oh, my God. What do we do? It's Amanda Campbell. Yeah. Do we just take her back? Yeah. Just take her back and explain everything. Uh-huh. You could have turned there. Chloe. I think this is an opportunity. What? -The plan. -What plan? -Last night. -Waffles and friendship? I think this might be destiny. This is a coincidence. Magic? Fate. There is something divine going on here. What about the-the bachelor party? You don't even know where she's going. I need a cigarette. Pull over. It's going to be fine. What are we doing? Can't talk here. Talk about what? We can't do that. Think about it, Domenic. These things don't happen all the time. That doesn't justify kidnapping her more than we've already kidnapped her. Ugh, we have not kidnapped her, okay? Besides, she doesn't even know she's been kidnapped. She's not going to be your friend once she figures it out. All right. The relationship will be strained at first, sure, but we've all seen Beauty and the Beast. And we can't take her to the house. No. I feel it. No. I say no. -No. Veto. -Upstate. We are not holding a celebrity hostage in my family's cabin. Do not call her a hostage. This is philanthropic. This is serious. It is perfect, it's isolated, away from all the glitz and glam of Hollywood, away from alcohol and, and paparazzi. Living in the original church. -Huh? -It's nature, Domenic. Mm. Look at her. I really think we can save this girl. She looks like the devil. I don't know, Chloe, this is-- this is a serious thing. No, no, no. Come on, come on. Hey, look at me. Look at me. Don't think about it like that. Just don't think about it. She's not even going to be mad. Like, when she's better and having her McConaissance. Look, I don't want to do this without you. Think of it as our one last hurrah, and then you can abandon me for college again. All right, enough. I'm going to save Amanda Campbell no matter what. Okay? I'll do it by myself. But I want you there. I need my best friend there. Please? There goes Amanda Campbell. -Wait, what? -She's going somewhere. Hey, where are you going? I have to pee. -She's peeing. -Peeing in the street. Yeah, well, that's where we're at. First of all, I want you to know this is not because of the Beauty and the Beast thing. But this, this does feel like a sign. She, she fell in our laps and, and, and maybe the-- Maybe you're right, God help us, the, the cabin. It, it would be a great place to recuperate. It could be fun, it will be fun, I'm having fun. Yeah. We're going to grow a lot from this experience. Ah! No punching. Zero punching. Atta boy. Rehabin' in the woods. - Okay. - One time. -I'm going to walk away. -Yes. Yes. Take her phone. What? Okay, we have to take her phone. If she finds out we're going northeast and not northwest, she might text someone. We should have done it sooner. Okay, that's creepy. I'm not a criminal. Okay. No. No, no, no. Go back. Ten and two. Fuck it. I'll have to go all the way back there. She's holding on so tight. You have to get it. Slow. Okay. Okay. Now what? She's going to notice that we have it. Okay, dude, I didn't have a plan beyond that. Oh. it doesn't even matter. She's got that... she's got that face I.D. shit. So cool. I did it. I guess we're really doing this. Dude. Where are we? Oh, good. You're awake. We are just arriving at a new innovative facility for grassroots inpatient care. I have no idea what any of that means. So, again, where are we? I cannot disclose where we are, but I can say we are here to help. You're kidnapping me? -Not exactly. -Yeah... You're kidnapping me? Are you fucking serious? It's for your own good. Oh, my God. Oh. God! Cunt! Yeah. Okay. No. Okay, thank you. Right back in. -No! -Oh, fuck. No! Oh, God! Ah! - Open the door. - I'm opening it. It's okay. Oh, my God. No! We're all going to laugh about this later, okay? The keys. Oh, the keys. Where are they? There should be a spare in the groundskeeper's shed. Groundskeeper? Is he here? No, I mean, I don't-- I don't think so. Oh, my God. Let's just... Go. Back up. Let's go that way. Okay. Hold her. She's weirdly heavy. You got her? I do not got her. I'm holding her feet. I got her. The keys are next to the fridge. Okay, we're falling over. I got rope! Domenic? Hi. Help. Ugh, I know, girlfriend. This is so degrading for me, too. But we can't have you starve. Fuck off and let me go. Don't yell. Eat the sandwich. Please eat. -Eat the sandwich. -No. - Eat it. - No. -You have to. -No. -You'll die. -I hope I do. -Eat it! -No! -Yes! -No! - Yes! - Yes! No! Goddamn it! I can make you another, or something else if you want. Sure. - What would you like? - Salad. Okay, if we have any it's from, like, a month ago, so... We might have some chicken. I'm a vegetarian. Oh, you're a vegetarian. I guess I'm, like, the Wardrobe. What? In Beauty and the Beast, The Wardrobe? Like, when the Beast is like "go ahead and starve" and then... So, I'm going back to college in a few weeks and Chloe's going to have the house to herself, and she doesn't do great without me, but she's a really special person. I think she'll really grow on you. Anyway, how are you? Oh, duh. Sorry. Can I ask you something? Is it weird to know that, like, I know stuff about you that you wish no one knew? Yeah, that's a self-answering question. Sorry. This is amazing. You're just saying that so I'll let you go. No, really. It's good. That'll do, pigs. That'll do. I can't sleep, so let's do that. I have so many ideas. She's so nice. We're doing such a good thing. Amanda? Amanda? Amanda? Amanda. What? Oh, shit. Listen, so, we have some stuff prepared for you downstairs if you'll cooperatively accompany me. I don't really have a choice, do I? Not really. Okay. Whew. Almost there. Jesus Christ. If you will just have a seat in this comfortable armchair. Sit down. There you go. Okay. Welcome to the Rehab Cabin, Amanda! Okay. Located in a completely isolated cabin in a location we're not at liberty to disclose, our team of non-medically trained professionals will help you get back on track. With the peace and serenity of nature as our guide, we hope to improve your health, help you kick that pesky drinking problem, regain your confidence and rejuvenate your career. Oh, God. Oh, my God. This is insane. You're out of your minds. Look, it's not going to be super regimented or anything. We're just going to have some non-alcoholic fun in the woods for a few months. -Wait, months? -A few months? Chloe we, like, didn't talk about- I'm an international celebrity. Everyone knows my name and you two are going to get thrown in jail for a long fucking time, you crazy asshole people. Oh sh... It's my dad. Be casual. Hey, Dad. Dom. Where you been, champ? Thought we were taking the plane out today. Sounds like you went ahead without me. Um, yeah, I meant to tell you, Chloe and I are at the cabin. Why didn't you tell me you were going up there? The whole family would have come up, it could have been fun. Yeah, we're, we're doing, like, a one-on-one hangout thing before I go back to school. That's real sweet. Yeah. You heard from your sister lately? -No. -You? No. I don't want to hold you, kiddo. Say hi to Chloe for me. -I will. -Bye. Bye. Whoo! Amanda? Amanda. Amanda, could you please come downstairs? We'd like to get started. Why are you doing this? We're trying to help you. We want you to be in good movies again. No. Why are you doing this to me? I didn't do anything. Um, okay. So, um, a few years ago, my sister was also really struggling with addiction. Um. And it was really hard, um, on me. She was, like, my best friend in the world and then I would look at her and it was like I couldn't even see her, like, at all. I couldn't help her, so... Is she okay? We haven't heard from her in almost eight months. Look, I'm not going to be nice to you now because of your sob story, okay? Like, Domenic told me about your weird Beauty and the Beast Stockholm Syndrome thing. That's fine. Yes, French-kissing puppet? I have a question for you. Go ahead. When do we kiss 'ze girls? Well, French-kissing puppet, we don't kiss the girls while we're driving. Fuck you guys. What? -Why? -This is your idea of rehab? We're just going to sit around here and watch shitty television? Oh, my God. We are trying to demonstrate a simpler, more relaxed way of life. What would you like to do? Go back to the city, obviously. Other than that, obviously. Okay. What would you like to do right here, right now? I want to go home! Okay, Demanda. Oh, go fuck yourselves. Oh, I have a board game! A board game? We made it when I was a kid. Aw. Hee-ah. This was fun. You're both completely fucked-up still, but it was fun. So, goodnight. That's an improvement, right? Should one of us... Oh, you know what, let her go. I think she's going to be okay. I still don't know the point of the game. Yeah. Ow! Was that... I'll, I'll check upstairs. Jesus. Shit, shit, shit. This. Domenic! Oh, you know what, Amanda? You're not going to get better if you keep on drinking behind our backs. I'm not drinking. That's the problem. I could literally die. Consider why you're here, Amanda. Consider-- No, please. Consider why we brought you here, okay? Concern. That's why. Genuine concern. For your personal health, safety and well-being. Huh! Okay, we trusted you! We let you put yourself to bed and you go behind our backs- Do you hear yourself? Do you hear yourself? We are trying to help you-- And I don't want it. Oh, my God, I am so mad at you right now, I can't even look at you. I swear to God, I have to look over here-- You? You're so mad at me? Oh, my God, this-- this is why you only have one friend. That's not true. Did you tell her that? Exactly! He doesn't have to! Name one person. Name one person besides him who's friends with you. Great. Michelle Pavlakis. And who the fuck is Michelle Pavlakis? She delivers our pizza. Hah! Do you hear that? That's the most pathetic thing I've ever heard. Ever. I hate you! And I hope you fucking die. So, how does that feel? How can you be friends with that? She's my best friend. How? How? Hey. Good morning. Holy shit. What's wrong? She's in withdrawal. From alcohol? Cool, we get a withdrawal montage. This is a medical emergency. I was kidding. Go get the stuff, please. Don't take your time. Don't take your time. Hey-ey. How is she? Oh, I, I got this, um... I found this straw in the car. I washed it, so... Are you mad at me? Yeah. I'm sorry. Thank you. I don't know why I get like this. I guess I just get, like... like, jealous? And then it, like, weirdly comes out. Chloe, I'm not going to abandon you for a '90s icon. I would abandon me for a '90s icon. Yeah, movie stars only, right? Movies, TV movies. That guy from Silver Chair. Okay, isn't it weird that all movie stars are doing TV now? Like, if you were born to be a TV star, but born at a time where A-list movie stars are on TV, where do you go? I'll try to be nice. That's all I ask. What are you doing? How'd you sleep? Great without the ropes. Great. We're going on a hike. And you leaving me here? No, you're coming. -I am? -Yeah. Do you know that scene in World Wide Witch when you're walking through the forest? Yeah. It has always been a personal dream of mine to recreate that scene. Also exercise. It'll be good for your ankle. Yeah. Exercise. Okay. I have a question: of the civilians that recognize you on the street, what percentage would you say do the "you bet, Mark" thing at the end? I don't know. God, that movie is good. Not in just, like, a nostalgic way. In a good way. You should be proud. It's so ingrained. Oh, like the-- like the Kimberley going to middle school song at the end. Is everything okay? Just-- it really sucks when you peak at 11 and everybody's judging you. Robert Downey Jr. is welcomed back with open arms. Rob Lowe made a sex tape with a teenager and everybody loves him, and... Johnny Depp... God, Chris Brown didn't even try. I don't even get credit for trying. -Are you trying? -Yes, I'm trying! I did a self-deprecating comedy and two movies last year. God, On Demand is still demand. Yeah, of course. Whatever. I know that I'm fucked-up, but at least I'm trying. Amy Winehouse. I mean, when she died everybody was like "big deal, who didn't see that coming?" I mean, God, when a man overdoses he practically gets canonized. God, I can't even think of an example right now because I'm too sad. Heath Ledger. Amanda, I understand what you're saying about women and it's definitely true, but I don't know if you should be comparing yourself to Amy Winehouse, God rest her soul. Or him. We're both addicts. Amanda, it's very brave of you to say. It's... I'm never going to be as good as that stupid movie. I'm never going to be that good again. John Bellucci. -Amanda? -What? Backstreet Boys or NSYNC? NSYNC. What? Are you serious? Cool, another thing that you guys are obsessed with? Well, look, Backstreet Boys are superior in every way. First of all, they pretty much started the entire boy band thing. No, they didn't. New Kids On The Block. That was before our time. The point is that NSYNC wouldn't even exist without the Backstreet Boys, so... Actually, I've started to see the point of NSYNC. - You have? - Yeah. It seems silly to have a Red Socks, Yankee thing, when clearly Justin Timberlake won the whole thing. Okay, yeah, but Domenic-- Plus, NSYNC is just more fun. Their songs are more dancey. I mean, Backstreet Boys are great for, like, a downbeat love song, but nothing beats "Tearin' Up My Heart". Hey, I've got a question for you, Amanda. Can you have kids? Excuse me? Like, do you want kids? Or do you think it's your responsibility not to have them? What is she doing? What are you doing? And just like the lifelong shitstorm that comes with being the child of Amanda Campbell. I mean, would that be considered child abuse? You're a fucking asshole. Do you even like acting anymore? It's none of your fucking business. I mean, your parents chose it for you and we all know what happened with them, so, why do you even keep doing it? Chloe, don't. I mean it. You make most of your living from night club appearances though, right? Like, you're playing yourself. You're famous for being famous. Look, I'm not always on, okay? And when I'm not that means that you don't get to have an opinion. Oh, you're acting during nightclub appearances. Okay, so, does that mean, like, when you're on the street and you're being followed by paparazzi that you have to, like, get in character in order to not feel violated? I'm not acting. It's self-preservation. I'm protecting myself from losers like you who think that you know me. So, you've turned Amanda Campbell into a character. That's not what I said. -You sort of did. -Can you just stop? You're putting words in my mouth. -I was just-- -Chloe. Stop. -Domenic, I was just-- -Just shut the fuck up. Domenic. Come here. I-I... Chloe, I truly... I do not want to do this right now. Can you not pull... The groundskeeper is here. Okay. Okay. That's okay. He's-- He comes for the horses, he, he never comes up to the house. No, you know what? Yeah. No. Yeah. It's-it's-it's-- -Let's kill him. -Wait, what? Amanda cannot know about this. How's it going? I'm surprised to see you here. I thought it was just going to be me and the horses like usual. Yeah, we're-we're just-- We're here. We're-- Oh, sure, sure. I understand. Sounds like fun. I wouldn't know anything about that. Oh, okay. So, um, we're just... we have a third friend here. She's-she's-she's not feeling great. Um, she was-- she was up all last night just barfing, so, if you could, you know, just keep it down, she just finally went to sleep. Right. That's why we're whispering. Oh, sure, sure. Well, I just wanted to stop by and say hi. I thought I saw someone up here and I wondered if it might be a mirage. Uh, this job can be pretty lonesome. Mm. Anyway, so good seeing you. We're just going to... we're going to check on our friend. All right, bye. I like your shirt. Missing actress Amanda Campbell last seen getting into a limousine outside a popular night club two weeks ago. Witnesses from the scene of Campbell's disappearance describe two Caucasian suspects, one male and one female dressed in what reports have called an ill-fitting men's suit. Authorities urge all locals to be on the lookout for any suspicious individuals matching this description. Jeez. I thought we were past this. I know. I'm... I'm sorry. Just trust the program. What are you doing? Nothing. I'll be right back. Okay, well, I mean, that's cute. -Yeah, right? -Yeah. -Hey, again. -Woah there. Something I can help you with? I forgot cheese. -You... -Forgot cheese. I was going to make an omelet, but how can you make an omelet without cheese? Can you? I-I-I wouldn't know anything about that. Well, anyway, I was wondering if you guys could have some cheese I could borrow? Not that you're going to want it back. We don't have cheese. I am viciously lactose intolerant. I'm sorry to hear that. Thank you. God bless you, child. Thank you. You know, I'm so sorry I couldn't be of any help, but, you know... Don't worry about it. Don't even think twice about it. Thank you. Chloe. Chloe. We need to talk. I hate that. Rephrase it. Can we talk about something? -Are you mad at me or-- -No, no. Okay. I think, I think that we should... we should- we should talk- Domenic, I can't hear you when you whisper that quiet. You know I had scarlet fever. Yeah, you didn't lose your hearing. Some people did. We should let Amanda go home. Huh? Hm, I don't know. We brought her to the Rehab Cabin. She's not drinking anymore. I hesitate to say we did a good thing, but, you know... She hasn't even had, like, the 12 steps or whatever. Like, you can't have a Hab Cab without the habilitation. Well, I just feel weird about it. So-so weirder. Why? Because you guys are friends now? -Yeah, so, I guess so. -Yeah. At the very least I, I care about her. You do, too. So, I think it's time we just let her go. Mmm, oh, I just don't think so. Not yet. Hm. Okay, Chloe. We're running out of time to do this on our terms. The groundskeeper is here and you were really out of line on the hike today. I have to go back to college in a few weeks, so- Wow, this is so like you, Domenic. What are you talking about? When, when have we even been in a situation even remotely similar to this? First, you flake out on all of our plans so you can go to college. Those weren't real plans. You wanted to live in a slacker movie with me. I didn't go to college to spite you, I went to college because-- Your parents said. Because your parents said. No. Because I wanted to. Because I wanted to have an adult life, yeah? God, that's so weird. For some reason I thought being an adult meant that you were not a total coward. -Hey. -Hi. -We're out of waffles. -Yeah. Hey, Domenic! And, at some point, I was like "I cannot spend another second here." Hey. I'm just going to go out to get some waffles. And other stuff. Okay. Need anything specific? No. -Amanda? -No, thanks. Great. Mm. Wait, is that you? Yeah. This is... this is fourth grade. Yeah, because we did this class project on the presidents. I was William Taft, but I was so embarrassed because the girl that was Grover Cleveland had a fatter costume than me. It's not supposed to... Anyway. Bitch. Oh. Oh, it's... it's my mom. Well, just leave me untied, okay? Hi, mom. Yeah. Sorry I missed your call. Help! Hello! Help! Help! Goddamn it, I'm Amanda Campbell. Nobody cares. Dear. Oh, my God. Amanda Campbell. My parents want to know when I'm coming home, but I'll talk to Chloe again and see about the whole thing. What did you do? He was going to call the police. Domenic. Now don't panic. I have this under control. Were you going to kill them? Hah! No. Not her, but him, yeah. We have to let them go. Domenic. If we let him go, he's going to tell. That's what they all say. It's over. It's been two weeks. It's over. I'm out. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no. No. This is crazy. This is fucking crazy. You... I just want to go back to school. -I just-- -Can you not make this about school right now! I am not making this about school, I am saying that I do not, cannot, want to commit felonies with you for the rest of my life, yeah? Why not? Is that a question? I mean, yeah. Yeah, not the felonies part, maybe, but, like, I don't understand why you want to, like, get away from me so badly all the time. I took a year off to hang out with you. I put my education on pause. I wouldn't do that for anyone but you, I don't-- But no, no, because, because you guys have been, like, teaming up and talking about me behind my back. When? When-when-when did this happen? - Earlier today. - When? Earlier. I don't know. The whole, like... the, like... the, like, I-can't-spend- another-second-with-you thing. Oh, my God, I was-I was- I was telling her the Adam story. You've heard that story 1400 times. Oh. Oh, yeah. Adam sucked. We need to talk about letting them go. We need to talk about turning ourselves in. No, it's not time. No, no, no, no, no. It's not time. It's time. It's so time. No, because-because this version of Amanda Campbell is not going to, like, march back into Hollywood and make good movies. Look at her. She's going to, like, maybe land an ABC Family Christmas movie in, like, four to six years, so... Okay. Excuse me. Hi. Um, now that we've steered this conversation away from your fucked-up friendship, I think it's important that I get a chance to speak for myself. No, I will not go back to making great movies, because no one will insure me. Okay? And this, this did not motivate me to get my life back on track at all because you kidnapped me. And, Chloe, I am, I am so sorry about what happened to your sister, but that does not justify-- Wait, wait. What sister? Her sister. The drug addict. What did you tell her? I don't have a sister. What the fuck, Chloe? It wasn't my fault. It was her fault. It was her fault. She was the one who was like "why are you doing this?" Like, I thought she would feel better if we had, like, a real reason. It was a story. She told you about my sister. Domenic, I-- Ew! Oh, my God. You're even crazier than I thought. That is awful. Oh, "ew," Amanda? -Yeah. -Ew? Ew? Am I crazy? I'm fucking crazy? I'm crazier than you thought, Amanda? Yeah! Yes! I'm crazy? I regret every second of this kidnapping vacation. No, you don't. I can't wait to go back to school. How are you? Oh, I'm good. Would you like a hot dog? Oh, no thank you. Okay. So, what do you do? I'm a hot dog vendor. I sell hot dogs. I see that. Would you like a hot dog? I have enough for everybody. You really like baseball and- You look really pretty. Oh, thank you. Oh, sorry. I wasn't talking to you. Hey. Hey, Chloe. Oh, hey, sleepyhead. Chloe, listen to me. This isn't good behavior. This-this doesn't even count as behavior. Hm. It is behavior. But behavior is, like... like what teachers say when, like, when you... like, the way you're supposed to be. They don't say behave when they want you to hold three people hostage. Yeah. But bad behavior is still behavior, right? Yeah, but you... you have to specify. Well, you have to specify for good, too. They don't just let people out of jail early for behavior. That would just be, like, people doing stuff. All right. All right. I'm sorry. I'm... I'm sorry for turning on you and making you think that this was the only way you could deal with me. Thank you. Will you please let me go? Look, I'm sorry about the stuff I said about school and regretting this. -I didn't mean it. -Yeah? I was caught in the heat of the moment. I was a bad friend. And if you untie me... I'll, uh, I'll help you deal with the groundskeeper. -You promise? -I promise. Okay. So. I was thinking that a reasonable method might be to put a plastic bag over his head. You know, give him a couple minutes and-- Hey, Dom! Domenic! Stop fighting me! Ow! You're untied. Go! Let's go. Domenic! - Does she have a chainsaw? - I don't know. Domenic, wait! I am not trying to kill you! She's going to fucking kill us! Chloe, no, no. Please we-- we can talk about this. I-I-I just-just... I'm sorry. I'm sorry that I... I'm sorry that I brought you here. I'm sorry that I got you into this, I'm-I'm-I'm sorry. Thank you. I don't like being this way. I don't like being this insecure. I don't like fighting with you. I just want things to go back to normal. Mm. Um, I have given you so many chances. You're, like, the only person I have, Domenic. Like, I guess there's my dad, but I've missed, like, two and a half weeks of work and he hasn't even called to see if I'm alive. I know I'm a loser. But I thought that's what you liked about me. Chloe. Can we please just go back to the house and resolve this? Please. We can do whatever you want. I just want to be friends again. Sorry. Oh. That's okay. That's okay. That's over. Ow! Fuck you! Why me? I'm on your side! Oh, you actually thought you Patty Hearsted me? I'm Amanda Campbell and I'm an actor, damn it. God, she's good. Welcome back to Trash Talk. For our final segment this evening, we'll be deep diving into the aftermath of the Amanda Campbell trial. I personally am so relieved to have our girl back from those monsters, and I just want to say that you're doing amazing, sweetie. - Seriously. - You know I. Oh, I know, and I just want to say that, even in her darkest days, I believed in her from the very beginning. And Amandaheads everywhere are thirsty for more. Even now, after months of her rescue, she's issued no public statement concerning her experience. Listen, the nation mourned after her disappearance. Family, friends and devoted fans were desperate for answers. And I know, personally, I'm still craving that loss. Mm. And sadly no word yet on when we'll next be seeing Amanda on the big screen. Despite numerous major studio offers, the big legend seems to be avoiding the limelight. Who knows what's next for the newly sober Amanda? All right, when we come back we're going to be taking a deep, dark look into the insidious minds of Amanda Campbell's kidnappers. Stay tuned. Oh, they know I can't even move a finger. And I won't. I'll just sit here, quietly, in case they do... suspect me. They're probably watching me. Well, let them. Let them see what kind of a person I am. I'm not even going to swat that fly. They'll see. They'll see and they'll know. And they'll say "why, she wouldn't even harm a fly." Okay, it's getting better, right? Hey. Hi. How are you? I'm good. I like it here. -How are you? -Okay. I'm going back to school next semester. That's nice they're letting you back. Yeah. My dad pulled some strings. I got time served and, um, I'll be busy with community service, but I guess it's... better than being in here. Okay, nice tattoos. Oh. My bunkie wanted to practice. Cool, I-I like 'em. Now, I'm confident that they look good. My dad doesn't like them, but... Yeah, well... What's with this eye? Won't be getting out on good behavior. How is Amanda? I don't know. Haven't seen her since the trial. No, I mean, like-like on the news. She's retiring. She's staying with her normal person cousin in, like, Michigan I think, doing an outpatient intense rehab thing. What? What? Isn't that what you wanted? She's taking her health seriously. No. I wanted her to be in good stuff again so I could be relieved of my responsibility of watching her terrible TV movies. I didn't want her to get better so she could just, like... like, be better. This is like the opposite of what I wanted. Well, it isn't up to you. And, you know, it's not a responsibility. You don't have a responsibility toward her. If-if she's making shit you don't want to watch, Chloe, just don't watch it. You don't-- you don't have to cling to every fucking thing that made you happy in your childhood. You don't... especially if it starts... no, look at me. Especially if it starts throwing up on concierge desks at-at-at different hotels more than once. Can you... I don't... Anyway. Yeah. Domenic, wait. Good luck in sixth grade? You bet, Mark. Okay, I'm cuffed to the table, right, so, like, it's a ready when-you-are type of situation.
