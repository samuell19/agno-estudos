Freedom-loving Americans. Good, strong, hardworking citizens. People who ask only to be left in peace so that we and our families may travel down the great American highway to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Unfortunately, our quest for the American dream is threatened, because we are caught in the middle of a terrible war. We the people are the helpless victims of mortal combat between two powers elite battling for economic and political control of our society. John Whitecloud is one such decent, American victim. John Whitecloud and the little people of Troma City, California, are caught and buffeted between the corrupt local political machine, which has a stranglehold on this town, and the ruthless corporate syndicate from the East, which will stop at nothing to gain total and absolute control. In the beautiful, pristine forests just outside Troma City, this syndicate is secretly launching a full-scale attack under the code name Fortress of Amerikkka. When John Whitecloud returned to his tribe's ancestral burial site, now used by tourists as a recreation park, he never suspected that these peaceful campgrounds were soon to become horrifying battlegrounds. He never suspected that he would become the leader of the citizens of Troma City against both the political machine and the Fortress of Amerikkka. Over there. No, no! Come on, start, start! No, no, get away, no! Come on, get off me, let me go! Let me go, no! - Come on. - No, no, let me go! Let me go, no, let me go! No, let me go, no! No! What do you want from me? No! I can't wait to see this stuff in print. Tie his arms to the tree and his legs to the car. Move it! This is our meal ticket, baby. - They're gonna kill him. - No kidding. And I'm getting it on film. What did I ever do to you? Nothing, old timer. You just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, that's all. I mean, your roll of the dice just came up. You see, old timer, you happen to know our camp, our location. We just can't have that. I won't tell. For God's sake, believe me! Then shoot me. Not this way. Well, now, that would be a little too easy, mister... What is your name? George McCullough. All right, George. If I may repeat myself, it'd be a little too easy. You see, you could propose a big problem to us. We have to eliminate you. We gotta get closer. Bob, it's too dangerous. Without good pictures, Eve, we've got no story. I didn't follow these guys for months to lose it now. I'm real sorry. Real sorry. No. - Apollo. - Please! Let's get the hell outta here. Come on, come on! We've got bogies headed towards the river in the north sector. Take 'em out. Repeat, no prisoners. Let's get 'em. Let's go. Eve! Boss, stop no, come on! Don't let him get into that car! Stop! Please, stop! Come on! Kill him, kill him! No! This here's your Colt.45. It's got an eight and three quarter inch barrel. So that will increase your velocity, but it won't hurt your accuracy. Go ahead, try that on. You got a six shot cylinder, it's blue steel. It's a honey of a weapon. That there's your people-shooting gun. It's all right, I need something bigger. Sure. What about the shotgun right there? Oh yeah, beautiful weapon. Try that on for size. Three-inch magnum shell. Check the pump action on that, baby. Why don't you throw in 20 boxes of shells while you're at it? Sure. Oh, by the way, since you're buying two items -- I can give you an extra 10% discount. Expecting trouble? Why don't you just cough up some release papers, Whitecloud? Nothing came up on the computer that said you're out on the street. What'd you do, boy? Get some high price, nigger Indian lawyer to get you off? Is everything okay, Sheriff? I mean, it's all right to sell him a shotgun, ain't it? Yeah. Everything's fine, for now. I hope you're only passing through. See, this is basically a very quiet town, and I aim to keep it that way. What happened to you four years ago, well, that's a memory. Look, while I was in prison, you killed my brother. And you want me to forget that? Oh, that was an accident. He came at me with a gun, I had no choice. Besides, it was me or him. But you killed my brother. Hey look, Whitecloud, you just better get that foolish notion outta your head. In fact, I'm giving you 48 hours to get your stuff and get out of town. This is King's County Paramedics. Fortress of Amerikkka. To this morning's accident on Route Nine. There's three adults and one child. Looks pretty bad, all badly burned. Just like those two campers. Okay, come on, let's get this mess off the road. - We'll be there as soon as possible. What's the problem? Oh, we've had a bad accident. Shouldn't take too much longer. What happened? The car caught on fire and the family went up in flames. Oh, that's terrible. Hell, maybe it's those big -- What do you think could have happened? like a grenade going off. It was horrible, just horrible. Hey, Jack Brody. - How you doin', Sheriff? - Good to see ya. Long time no see. Where's Elizabeth? Oh, she's up at the campsite. This here's Leslie. Oh, pleased to meet you, ma'am. Oh, by the way, if you see anything suspicious up in the Hills, you give me a call. Like what? Well, I don't want to alarm you, but we have some mercenaries, soldiers of fortune, what have you, up there playing war games. Strictly trespassers. But they give you any trouble, you call me. Anything we should be concerned about, Sheriff? No, ma'am, you just keep an eye out and you see anything suspicious, you let me know. All right, Sheriff, we'll do it. - Take care. - All right. Thanks, Sheriff. It was a pleasure meeting you. Crimson Leader to base camp. We got intruders in the north sector. One male and one female. Hold your position and wait for further orders. Over and out. I only have a few minutes. That's okay. I just want to ask you a question. It's about John, isn't it? Listen, lady, news around here travels fast. Usually know about it the day before it happens. I'm not sure I should go see him. Peter and I are engaged, and this could put a monkey wrench in the whole situation. Listen, Jennifer, just go to him. Talk with him. You know, I'm sure he's changed. For that matter, he might even have somebody else. I suppose you're right. So John's been in prison. He's killed a deputy. He's always in trouble with the law. He's an American Indian. And your parents will never speak to you again, so what? Go see John and then make up your mind. I mean, you'll never forgive yourself if you don't give yourself this one opportunity to clear the air. I just hope I'm not making a big mistake. I'm scared, Susan. I've come back, Little Brother. I've come back to avenge your untimely death. I will raise you from the dead and together, we will bring some truth and perhaps justice out into the open, so that your soul can continue its journey in peace. I know that Father would have wished this so. Playing cards. Yeah, you know, I went over to Johnny's the other night. He's got some serious foot odor. Oh yeah? - Man, what a day. - Yeah, I'm beat. Hey, Williams. Attention! At ease, soldier. Sit down, will you? More transmissions, sir. Clear the tent. As I understand, you're having a little difficulty adjusting to our way of training, is that right? Look, I came here to train to fight terrorism. My mother and sister were killed by a terrorist bomb in London. When I joined up with this outfit, I wanted to keep my military skills on edge, sharp, to be ready. Well, I understand. So when you're called upon to go out in the world to fight terrorism, you're gonna be combat ready. Good soldiers ever ready for battle. But to kill an innocent prospector? That man didn't harm anyone. He had no weapons, he was defenseless. And the way you had him killed -- Oh, now, wait a minute. I don't know if you're aware of this or not, but he was the enemy. I mean, he knew our location, our position here. All I understand is that I don't want to kill innocent bystanders. Training is one thing, killing is another. My coming here has been a mistake, and I'm just now beginning to realize it. A mistake? A mistake? No, no. Death is a coward. It will not show its face here, and I will not tolerate losers, only winners. Now, winning is everything, and losing is defeat, and it's death, and you know that! Look, I just want out! All right, you want out, so be it. But in order to leave our unit without disgrace, one has to go through a little... oh, a gauntlet. Look, I'm not quite sure I understand. Oh, it's just a little test, so to speak, to see if you're worthy of leaving us. Certainly, you wouldn't want to return to England a coward, a loser, would you? - No. What do I have to do? Now let's have three cheers for our English comrade. Hip hip! - Hooray! - Hip hip! - Hooray! - Hip hip! - Hooray! Fortress, fortress, fortress, fortress, fortress! Fortress, fortress! Ready, Mr. Williams. Death to all traitors of Fortress of Amerikkka! For the pinnacles of justice and freedom will rein supreme! Now the death of our English comrade, Robert Williams, will serve as a reminder that no traitor will be tolerated! Now when each of you came to Fortress of Amerikkka, you took a holy oath, a vow sealed in your own blood, to protect those principles of freedom and peace. We are freedom fighters of a high order. We are ordained by the almighty above to protect and to serve freedom and peace! And we're together. We're together in life, as we are united in death. That's what our Fortress of Amerikkka is. So come on, are you with me? Yeah! Then let's hear it, Fortress of Amerikkka! - Yeah! - Fortress of Amerikkka! Fortress of Amerikkka, Fortress of Amerikkka! Fortress of Amerikkka, Fortress of Amerikkka! Fortress of Amerikkka, Fortress of Amerikkka! Fortress of Amerikkka, Fortress of Amerikkka! Fortress of Amerikkka, Fortress of Amerikkka! Bartender. You sure you need a glass? Okay, just keep pouring, I'm buying. I have a room upstairs. Why don't you go up there and sleep it off? Look, I got a lot of things to take care of while I'm here. Why don't you just mind your own business, okay? Sure, whatever you say. Hey, why don't you keep the whole bottle? It's your funeral. Not now, Peter. Jennifer. It's just that... something's come back into my life. You mean John, don't you? I know he's back. Yes, but it's not what you think. You still have feelings for him, don't you? He was the first man to ever make love to me. I can't just forget him. He was special. Look, if you want to see him, I understand. We were going to be married and they sent him away to prison. My parents pressured me into forgetting about him, but I hung around with John's brother, Jim, instead. I was there the day the sheriff shot Jim down on the beach. I've tried to forget the past... but how can you forget something that's such a part of you? I'm afraid of tomorrow. If John makes one false move or turns his back, the sheriff will kill him. John doesn't have a future here. Hey, watch what you're doing! Come here. Get lost, creep! Nice shot. I haven't seen you here before. Buy me a drink? Sure, what's your name? Jenny. That's a pretty name, Jenny. I'm John, John Whitecloud. Jenny, what do you say you and I get outta here? Go to a little cabin down by the river? Wait a minute. I know you. You're that guy that they sent away to prison a few years ago. Is this guy bothering you? Yeah, this guy tried to pick me up. I'm not bothering anybody. Now listen, buddy. You giant! I want to be made aware of John Whitecloud's every move in this town. I want to know where he sleeps, who he sleeps with, what he eats, what he drinks and where he goes to the bathroom. I understand he was almost arrested at that nightclub disturbance or something last night. That's right, some girl drove off with him. We'll keep better surveillance on him, sir. You do that. 'Cause I want him behind bars when he violates his parole. Woo hoo! Yee-hoo! What's going on? What are you, fucking crazy? What's he talking about? Move it, hurry up! I'm coming, I'm coming! You know, Sarge, what about the girl? No prisoners. What's he gonna do to me? What's going on, dude? What you got, Pete? Looks like a slaughterhouse in here. This one's dead. Looks like an automatic, probably an M-16, straight across the chest. You wanna hear the best part? There's no witnesses. Come on, I don't buy that shit! Where's the coroner? Waiting for you in his office. All right, look, you go knock on some doors, you see if anybody saw anything. The reason I called you here was to show you these bullet holes in the park girl you brought in last week. I removed one of the bullets that were lodged in her skull. And? It's a military type, but not from around here. Probably foreign made. I checked with the gun store and they said this bullet is banned in the United States. It's illegal to import them without a special permit. From the way the bullets penetrated the flesh, I'd say she was killed with a fully automatic machine gun from about five feet. Fortress of Amerikkka. Did anything turn up on that car fire from yesterday? Oh, no. Nothing yet. The remains were burned pretty bad. I'm checking dental records and that sort of thing. But some military shells were found just down from the accident. The same type of bullet that I removed from this body. Look, I'd appreciate it if you'd just keep all this information under wrap for now. Oh, sure, sure. What are you doing here? I wanted to see you. We need to talk. There's nothing to talk about. It's over between us. You better go. I can't go. I love you. It's a little late for that, isn't it? Look, while I was in prison, you never came to visit, you never wrote. I'm tired of screwing around. I gotta get on with my life. Does that include killing the sheriff? Look, I tried to forget about you. I really did. I made a big mistake. I still think about you every day. What about Peter? Don't you think about him every day? As a matter of fact, don't you sleep with him every night? It's over between Peter and me. I love you. Look, you were with my brother the day the sheriff gunned him down on the beach. Why didn't you file a police report? I did. They tore up the report. Nobody believed me. It was my word against the sheriff's. Was my brother shot in the back in cold blood? Yes. I was with your brother on the beach that day. The sheriff had followed us. He was looking for Jim. Your brother never had a chance. I know how you feel about me, about everything. All I ask is that you give me one more chance. Please. I don't know. I just don't know. Wait, wait, wait. Come on, sleepy head. Time to rise and shine. Mmm, I slept like a baby. What time is it? Almost 8:00. Come on, let's get going. Okay. Elizabeth? What? If I'm in the way or anything, you know, if you need a little bit of privacy, I could sleep in the car. Don't be silly, now get dressed! Okay. Well, hey, I'm just gonna lay here and read for awhile. Elizabeth! Up you come. I'm all right, how about you? - Kids? - Yeah, fine, fine. Good, good, how's the house coming along? All right, everybody. Listen up. I just got the coroner's report in on that car fire from the other day. Also the Clark killing from two weeks ago. Seems we have a problem. All right, I'm sure you're all aware that war games, basically just guys dressed in cammies firing blood pellets at each other, are extremely popular now. It looks like we've got a group of those guys around here. Only problem is that around here, they're using real bullets. Are you trying to tell us there's a connection between these war games and that car fire out on the highway? No question about it. The report I got in today indicates there was a husband and wife in the car, another male companion, as well as a five-year-old girl. Now, that car didn't just catch fire like we first suspected. It went through a war zone. The Clark girl, on the other hand... well, she was executed by a firing squad. I know this may sound a bit grim to all of you, but there may be other killings we're not even aware of just yet. Well, what are we supposed to do? Do we need to bring in more manpower? Yeah, what's our plan of attack? All right, relax. I don't want anyone doing anything just yet. I didn't want to create a panic around here. I've contacted the sheriff up in Kings County. I got a couple of feelers out with the police department in Seattle. For now, we just sit tight. However, I want you to check out every report that comes in. We're looking for an organization that's self-contained, militaristic, and they're not playing games. They're killing people, all right? They're anything from ex-cons to soldiers of fortune, possibly mercenaries. What exactly are we looking for in terms of size? I'll tell you what we're looking for, Deputy. The Clark girl had the following inscription carved into her skin with a knife while she was still alive... "Fortress of Amerikkka," that's what we're looking for. Yesterday, he said he loved me. Today, it's a different story. I'm gonna take a cold shower in the river. Any of you girls wanna come? What, in the river? Hey, how's it goin'? Just finished a 10-mile hike. I've got a blister for three miles and still counting. How 'bout you? You seem pretty engrossed there. Oh yeah, I'm kind of, like, just cleaning my machine here. Karl says that a clean machine is a weapon that won't jam up on me in combat, or blow up in your face. Blow your brains out. You know what I mean? Do you know what I mean? Do you know what I'm talking about? Yeah, I know what you're talking about. I think you're pretty crazy. Hey, you know I had this fantasy that, well, we were on this desert island somewhere out on the South Seas. Silly, huh? I thought so. Well, you know, I figured that maybe we could, you know, take a stroll, get some fresh air, maybe talk it out. I mean, I know I'm no jock, okay? And you said that that didn't matter to you. That what mattered to you was what was inside of somebody. At least I heard that line somewhere before you. Hey, so I figured that maybe we could work it out, you know? I mean, just you and me. I mean, hey, look, I'm not just any ordinary guy, okay? I'm not a piece of meat and my shit don't stink. Incidentally... Did I tell you it was my birthday today? Oh, Jeff. Happy Birthday. Hey, that's pretty nice. Where do you aim for when you fire? The balls. Yeah, my daddy always said, "aim for the balls." He says women always recoil more than men do, and that way, I compensate. And I get my target in the heart every time. Fuck. I was wondering why I keep blowing their heads off. That's it. Where is she? Where's Cassandra? What's your problem, honey? She's crossed my path for the last time. Back off, bitch. She keeps humiliating me and putting me down! I'm better than she is and everybody knows it. Either she goes, or I go. I know I'm not supposed to be here. I'm afraid. You shouldn't be afraid here. You're perfectly safe. It's just... all the talk about the killings that are going on in some of the training sessions and nightly patrols. Some of those killings aren't accidents, are they? You have to understand that death means nothing to me. When you joined the Fortress of Amerikkka, you took an oath. You gave up your soul, your physical being. It's just... I came to Fortress of Amerikkka to train. And lately, everyone's just talking about killing and hurting people. Be careful. Don't worry about me. But she deserves it. Do you really have to go through with this? Yes. She's just a kid. Rules are rules. Fucking A they are! Stay out of this. All right. Bitch! Oh, nice! Let's forget about all this unpleasantness for now. What about the other men, won't they be back? They're out on patrol. They won't be back until daybreak. Take it, take it. Come on. Do it, do it. You don't have the guts! Kill her. Kill her. Kill her. Kill her, kill her, kill her. What are you waiting for? You coward! - Good job. - You did it, Cassandra. Way to go, way to go. She really did it. And she was asking for it. Oh yeah, she definitely was. - That was beautiful. - Good job. Don't come any closer. Whoa. What seems to be the problem? It looks like you got some gas leaking down here. Are you okay? No, I'm not okay. You see, my friends, Jack and Elizabeth, they didn't come back last night. They were out on a hike and... well, I'm scared. I was on my way to see the sheriff. Why don't you let me take you back into town? Okay, thanks. I'm sorry about the gun, I was just frightened. Don't worry about it, it's okay. I'm Leslie. I'm John. John Whitecloud. Come on. - Hey! - Let go. No. - Hold him. Leave me alone! What if I slice up your little throat, huh? No! You little son of a bitch! Hey! Crazy little son of a -- No! Take your best shot, bitch! Shoot! - Come on. - Look at his chubby face. It's so fat you can't miss it, come on. Right here. Right here, come on, right here, right here! Come on, shoot me, let's go! You can do it! Can I help you? Well, I sure hope so. Listen, we need a fuel pump for a car that's stuck back up on the highway. You think you can help us out? Sorry, we're all fresh out of parts. What about a tow? Tow truck's broken. Besides, we have a policy here not to service ex-cons. Let's get that scum off my property. Get him! - Let's get that Indian SOB. Ooh. John! Ten, hut! Who's responsible for the death of those children on the beach? I am, sir! Well, now, we just don't kill children. Especially when we can have problems as a result of this. Do I make myself clear? Well, what should we have done, sir? Well, I think we should have taken some evasive action. I don't think we should have come out in the open. I don't think we should have had direct confrontation. I swear, I swear on my mother's grave that if you step out of line one more time, I'm gonna have all of you court-martialed and shot! You got that? Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. All right, you two. You two are going out on extra night patrol for a week. All except for Bazooka. Thank you, sir. What the fuck? It's not fair, sir. All right, Bazooka. Now, I understand... I understand that you were teasing, tormenting the children before they were killed, is that true? Yes, sir. Look at me when you say, "yes sir!" Is that true? Yes, sir! I'll tell you something, punk. Right now, you better take that cat and mouse mentality and stick it! Huh? Yes, sir! - What? - Yes, sir! And another thing. If I hear... If I hear that you guys are resting on these details, you're gonna have to answer to me personally. You got that? I want to hear it! You got it?! Yes, sir! All right, just get outta here. Go on, get outta here! We'll take your deposition down at the station. I can give you a full account of what happened. You okay? Yes, I'm all right. I'm just a little shaken up. Yeah, well, don't worry. That jerk's not gonna bother you anymore. What happened here, anyway? I seen him and his girl came in and started busting things up for no reason at all. That's not true. You know, Miss, around these parts, folks don't take too lightly to white women hanging all over nigger Indians, especially ex-convicts. He was just trying to help me. Say, didn't we see you down at the roadblock the other day? Yes, I was with Jack Brody and Elizabeth. Look, John was just gonna take me into town. I was on my way to your office to let you know that Jack and Elizabeth didn't come back to camp last night, and I'm afraid something happened to them. Book her for being an accessory. You can't do that! You have no right to do this. Take your hands off of me! Get away from her! I'd like that. No, don't do that. We have a very open relationship. Light my fire, baby. Well, you never know. All right. Woo hoo, yeah! Another night with me, huh? Get out of the way! Just chill out, all right? Just chill out. Jennifer, where have you been? I called your house. - What's wrong? - Listen, John's in jail. He got into a fight at the gas station. I gotta go. Listen, don't do anything stupid! Looking for something? The gun, where is it? Wait a minute, tell me what this is all about. I can't, you're just gonna have to trust me. Trust you? You haven't been here or called in three days, and you want me to trust you? Peter, please. I think I get the picture. At first, I was just convenient for you. But now, with John back, I guess I'm out, is that it? No, that's not it. I just needed to be by myself for a little while. To think about whether I was gonna stay with you, or -- Go back to John? That's if he stays out of prison long enough. But I love you. Doesn't that mean anything to you? But I love somebody else. Run, Elizabeth, run! Come on! And how was this allowed to happen? We had a serious breach of security, sir. Two of the guards were drinking heavily and they left their post. What the hell is happening to the men here? Where is the damn discipline? I don't know, sir. It's just that -- - You just think what? Speak up, Apollo! The men are anxious to go on another operation, sir. And want to kill, go out and hunt. Not just sit around and train, sir. Oh, well, I understand their enthusiasm, soldier, but until we receive word about our air lift out of here and our objective, we are going to maintain. Do you understand that? Yes, sir. Damn it, three soldiers were killed, right under our very noses, here in our camp! They won't get far. Red Leader One has a patrol out. He's closing in on 'em now. And I've given him orders to kill 'em on site. Aw, get outta here! Apollo? Don't come back without 'em. I'm sorry I yelled at you back there at the tent. America is the land of tolerance and freedom, and it's your right as a citizen to do and enjoy whatever you want. I'm sorry, I should have been stronger. We have freedom in this country, but with that freedom comes the responsibility of doing what's right. Elizabeth, it's people like us that are the backbone of America. And if you enjoyed the way that mercenary touched you, then that's your right as a citizen in this great country of ours. Jack, I'm still scared. What if we don't make it back to our car? Don't worry, honey, I'll protect you. They're not gonna kill us. Nothing here. We found their camp, but no activity. They can't get very far at night. We'll stay here tonight, then rendezvous at the crest of the hill and get them first thing in the morning. Roger and out. Look, we'll go find our car. We'll go get the sheriff and everything's gonna be all right. What if the mercenaries find us first? I don't know how I'm gonna get outta here, but I'm gonna get out. Can I help you? I'm here to post bail for John Whitecloud. You'll have to wait until Monday morning to do that. Okay, no problem. Except, you know, I really do need to get him out tonight. What are you doing here? I thought you might need some help. If the sheriff thinks that this is gonna stop me, he's wrong. John. What are you doing here? Where's Jennifer? - Let's go. - We're in this together. Come on! Let's go, let's get out of here. - Where are we going? - Are you crazy? You can't go back. - Get in! We have to get out of town. It's too dangerous, please. Look, why the hell did we come back here? I have a score to settle. I just can't run away from that. Run away? Am I hearing you correctly? I just risked my life to break you out of jail! If we leave this town tonight, while we still can, the sheriff will leave us alone. Look, you don't understand, do you? All I understand is that if we stay, you're gonna either end up dead like your brother, Jim, or back in prison. Some choice. I don't personally think that there's that much to understand! I don't want to be in trouble with the law. I'm a criminal now. Don't worry about it, everything will be okay. The sheriff's just got it in for John, that's it. You just need to get out of this town. I suppose you're right. Look, get some sleep. I'll be in the next room if you need anything, okay? Thanks. Peter? Do you think you could stay with me tonight? I really need to be with someone. Look, Jennifer, I appreciate everything you've done for me. It's just... you forget the fact that I'm half Indian. I can't just stand by and pretend nothing's happened. Well, I'm part Indian, too, but the days of scalping, and revenge killing, and smoking the peace pipe are over! Jennifer, I know that. Look, you of all people should understand that I have to lay my brother's soul to rest. Jennifer, look. This is just something I have to do. I'm sorry. I want the county chopper here at daybreak. Deputy Johnson, I want you and the chopper to head up to Lookout Mountain. You see that Indian up there, you radio for backup. We'll send two units to cover the highway. Pete? - Yes, sir. I want you and Denise to check out the Indian's cabin. He's probably split, but his whore might be there, so play it safe. Don't want anyone taking any chances. This Indian is armed and dangerous. He won't come back without a fight. Shoot to kill, boys, no glory. We'll ask questions later. Rest of you I want to remain here. I'm gonna check out the spot where I think he's hiding out. We captured his brother there two years ago after he killed one of our deputies. We'll roll out of here in the morning at 0600 hours, alone. If I need any backup, I'll radio for help. Don't you think it's a little dangerous going there by yourself? Shouldn't you take one of us for backup? I got a score to settle. You just give me an hour with that Indian, is that clear? Got it. Spread out, men, spread on out. Okay, I want you, Sergeant, and you, Bazooka, to come with me. Take north sector, I'll take the south. Surround 'em! Damn! Dispatch, this is Deputy Wilson. Deputy Johnson and I are on our way to Whitecloud's cabin to investigate, over. John, I'm scared. Freeze! I figured you'd be by sooner or later. Come by to pay your last respects? I'm not going in with you. I don't think you got a choice. This ain't no game show. John, please! Well, Whitecloud. Clear case of self defense. Just like your brother. We're gonna have to take care of you, just like we did those two nature lovers. - Hey. - Hello. Got a light? Yeah. I'm supposed to feed you. Where's my girlfriend? Where'd they take her? I don't know. I'm sure she's all right. Look, do you want to some of this? No, I'm not hungry. God, you're just a kid. What? What are you, 17? Do you even know what's going on here? Of course I do, we're in training. We're a secret branch of the government. You mean covert. Something like that. Why did your men kill the sheriff in the cave? I don't know anything about that. I wasn't there. There are strict rules around here about trespassers. I'm sure there was a logical explanation for it. You really believe that? Look, whatever's going on here isn't right. What you're doing here, this whole operation, it's illegal as hell. Look, do you want some of this? All right, everybody, listen up. Shut up! We might not have much time left. This is John Whitecloud. He's gonna lead us into the Fortress of Amerikkka camp. We have reason to believe there's a group of mercenaries, or soldiers of fortune, in this camp that are responsible for a group of killings in this town. We also believe that they're responsible for the killing of the sheriff. We'll see. Right now, I'm swearing all of you men in as deputies. I want every man in this town rounded up to help us. I'm not quite sure what we're up against here. You make one false move and I'll blow you away. Look, my girlfriend's in there. I'm gonna go get her out. Any questions? My own, sweet, darling daughter was murdered in the motel the other day. I say we blow them fuckers to hell! Hold it, hold it! All right, listen up! Come on! John and I are going in there by ourselves. We're gonna check things out. We'll report back to you if we find anything. There's no sense in anybody getting prematurely killed here. About how far is it from here? Look, it's about two miles up the river. We'll blow the fuckers away, you know what I mean? Stay here, that's an order! Come on. Come on. Mercenaries are gonna kill our people! Let's get 'em! Go and blow their fucking brains out! Come around this way! What the hell is going on, Whitecloud? You told me they were here. There's no one in sight. The observation tower's empty. Oh, they're here all right. This is a trap. Believe me, they're here. Go back and get the others. I'll stay here and check things out. Look, Jennifer's in there somewhere. If you do anything stupid, she's gonna be the first one they kill. And if anything happens to her, I'll be -- You'll what? This is my show now, Whitecloud. You're in enough trouble as it is. Now you go back and get the others. This compound is being surrounded. Wait a minute. Throw out your weapons and come out with your hands behind your head. What's the hell's he doin'? We can do this peacefully, or we can do this with force. Jennifer! Oh, you! Come on, come on! Where is she, where's Jennifer? You're too late. One more time, where is she? Hey, idiot! Oh, shit! Help! Yeah! Jennifer? I'm over here! Jennifer. What took you so long? Your sweetheart's down there, in the hole. What have you done to her? I took really good care of her. It's a shame you're too late. You got a problem, pal? I've been hit. Oh my God, help me. Here, let me help you, you son of a bitch! Next time, you'll think twice about killing innocent people, you bastard. Jennifer? Jennifer? It's almost over. It's gonna be okay. Look out! Here, take this. You think we've done enough damage around here? No, Fortress of Amerikkka should never be allowed to exist in this country. Not as long as the three of us are around. Come on, let's blow this joint. In light of all the evidence before me, this court finds you, John Whitecloud, Not Guilty of all the charges brought against you. It is clear from the coroner's report that you did not shoot and kill Sheriff Tom "Tex" Bodean. From eyewitness report, the incident at the gas station was not provoked by you. I therefore order all charges against you dropped. Case dismissed. Hey, congratulations, John.
