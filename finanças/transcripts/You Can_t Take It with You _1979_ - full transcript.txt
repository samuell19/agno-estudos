[instrumental music] [typewriter clacking] [clacking continues] [music continues] [music continues] [growling] [clacking continues] [growling] [music continues] [instrumental music] [birds chirping] My, that kitchen's hot. What? What, Essie? I say that kitchen's awful hot. That new candy I'm making, it just won't ever get cool. Hmm. Do you have to make candy today, Essie? It's such a hot day. Well, I got all those new orders. Ed went out and got a bunch of new orders. Oh, my, if this keeps up, you'll be opening a store. That's what Ed was saying last night, but I said "no". I want to be a dancer. Ooh! I'm sorry. The trouble with dancing is, it takes such a long time. You've been studying for so long. Only...eight years. After all mother, you've been writing plays for eight years. We started about the same time, didn't we? Yes, but you mustn't count my first two years because I was learning to type. I think your candy's hardening up now, Essie. Oh, thanks, Rheba. I'll bring some in, mother. I want you to try it. Finished your second act yet, Mrs. Sycamore? Oh, my. No, Rheba. I've just got Cynthia entering a monastery. Wait a minute. She was at the Kit Kat club, wasn't she? Yes, but she gets tired of the Kit Kat club and there's this monastery, so she goes there. - And they let her in? - Yes, I made it visitor's day. - So, of course, anybody can go. - Oh. And she arrivers on visitor's day and she just stays. - All night? - Yes, she stays six years. Six years? My, I bet she bust that monastery wide open. Oh! "Six years later." - Mr. DePinna. - 'Yeah?' Would you bring one of the new skyrockets? I wanna show it to Mrs. Sycamore. (Mr. DePinna) 'Sure.' Penny, what do you think of these new little firecrackers we made? We can sell 'em ten strings for a cent. Listen. [popping] - Nice, huh? - Yes. Paul dear, were you ever in a monastery? No. I wasn't. Wait till you see the new skyrockets. Gold stars, blue stars, bombs and a balloon. Mr. DePinna thought of the balloon. Here we are. Ha ha ha. Look at this, Penny. We make them for 18 cents and sell them for 50. How many could we make before the 4th of July, Mr. DePinna? We got two weeks, when're you gonna take it to Mount Vernon? In a week. We're gonna need a larger booth. - We got a lot more stuff. - Mr. Sycamore. The only thing that bothers me, I'm afraid the powder chamber is a little bit close to the balloon. The blue stars and the bombs are in between. That don't give the balloon time. The balloon needs plenty of time. Come on. Let's get outside and try it. - Alright. - 'Mr. DePinna.' If a girl you loved entered a monastery, what would you do? Oh, I don't know, Mrs. Sycamore. It's been so long. [instrumental music] Well, you'd think with 40 monks and one girl something would happen. Is Alice gonna be home for dinner tonight, Mrs. Sycamore? Oh. No. I don't know, Rheba. - Maybe. - I'll set a place for her. She ain't been home but one night this week. Yes, I know. Let see. Six. Mr. DePinna and if Mr. Kolenkhov comes that makes eight, don't it? [firecrackers bursting] Yeah, I better set for eight. Rheba, I'm gonna put this play away for a while. I'm going back to the war play. Oh, good, Mrs. Sycamore. I always liked that war play. Would you out Groucho and Harpo in the kitchen, please? They'll be better when they're hotter. Try one. I wanna know what you think. My, they look lovey, Essie. What do you call them? I think I'll call them "Love Dreams." That's nice. Essie, I'm going back to the war play, what do you think? Oh. Are you, mother? Well, I've sort of got myself in a monastery and I can't get out. Well, it'll come to you, mother. Remember how you got out of that brothel. Hello, boys. The snakes look hungry. Did Rheba feed them? I don't know. I believe I'll have another Love Dream. Oh, Mr. DePinna was right about that balloon. It was too close to the powder. I'm going back to the war play, Paul. Oh, that's nice. I'm gonna wash. - Hey, Essie. - Yes. - Look at this. - What? - What is it? - Wait don't talk, don't talk. [xylophone music] Oh, Ed. I like it. Did you write it? No. Beethoven. Lovely. Got a lot of you in it. I made a lot of those new candies this afternoon, Ed. Yeah? You can take them around tonight. Alright. Now, this is the big finish. This part is me. [music continues] Oh. Oh, that's fine, Ed. Remember tonight when Kolenkhov comes, will you? Alright. Ed dear, why don't you and Essie have a baby? I was thinking about that just the other day. I don't know. We... could if you wanted us to. What about it? Wanna have a baby? I don't care. I'm willing, if grandpa is. - Let's ask him. Alright? - Alright. "Labor play, religious play, sex play." I know it's here somewhere. Rheba. What's for dinner? I'm about to print up the menu. Hmm, lets see. Watermelon, corn flakes.. ...some of those candies Essie made. - And some kinda meat. - Alright. I think, I'll set it up in bold face Cheltenham tonight. If I'm gonna deliver the candies I better think up some descriptive matter. Ed, do you think people really read those things that you put in candy boxes? Oh, here's the war play. "Poison Gas." That must be Donald, look at Rheba smile. Ah, the boyfriend, huh, Rheba? Oh, Donald and Rheba are so cute together. Sort of like Porgy and Bess. Hello, Rheba. Donald. - Hi, Donald. - Good evening, Mrs. Sycamore. - How've you been? - Very well, thank you. - Hi, Donald. - Hi, Ed. - Oh, Donald. - Yes, ma'am. Were you ever in a monastery? No. I don't go no place much. I'm on relief. Oh, yes, of course. Got the flies for the snakes. - Caught a mess of 'em today. - Oh, yeah. - How's grandpa? - Fine. He's at Columbia this afternoon. The commencement exercises. What's he go there all the time for? I don't know. It's handy just around the corner. Oh, hi, Donald. - 'Hi.' - Say. Mr. DePinna and I are taking the fireworks up to Mount Vernon next week, could you give us a hand? Yes, sir. Only I can't take no money for it. The government finds out I've been working, they'll get sore. Oh. I just had a wonderful idea in the bathroom just now. I was reading Trotzky. That's yours, isn't it, Ed? - I left it in there. - Who is it? You know Trotzky, the Russian revolution? Oh! Anyways, it struck me as a great fireworks idea. Remember "The Last Days of Pompeii? Oh, yes. Palisades Park. That's where we first met. Well, I'm gonna do the revolution. A full hour display. - Say.. - I think that's wonderful. - And the red fire is the flag? - And the Czar and Cossacks. And the freeing of the slaves. Well, sir, you should've been there. That's all I can say, you should've been there. - Hi, grandpa. - Hello, grandpa. Was it a nice commencement, grandpa? Wonderful, wonderful. They get better ever year. You don't know how lucky you are you're snakes. Big class this year, grandpa? How many were there? Oh, it must have been about two acres of them. Everybody graduated, too. Much funnier speeches than they had last year. Wanna listen to a good speech? You go and hear Father Divine. No, I'll wait. They'll have him at Columbia. Donald, would you tell Rheba grandpa's home and we won't wait for Miss Alice Yes, ma'am. Rheba, grandpa's home we can have dinner now. Grandpa, Mr. DePinna and I made a new skyrocket today. Wait till you see it. I wonder why they don't have fireworks at commencements? Don't make enough noise. You take a good commencement order you'll drown out a whole car load of fireworks. Say just about as much, too. Don't the graduate ever say anything, grandpa? [sighs] No. They just sit there in their cap and night gown. Get their diplomas. Then, along about 40 years form now, they suddenly say "Where am I?" Hello, grandpa. Have a nice day? "Hello, have a nice day?" Don't I even get kissed? Excuse me, grandpa. I'll take a tomato. I could've used a couple of these at commencement this afternoon. That's right, Ed. Play something. Hey, Donald come around here. There was a letter came for you, grandpa. Did you get it? A letter for me? I don't know anybody. Was for you, though. Had your name on the outside. Who was it from? Did you notice? Yes. Was on the outside. Well, who was it? United States government. Really? Wonder what they want. There was one before that, from the same people. There was a couple of them. Essie, if anymore come I wish you'd give 'em to me. Yes, grandpa. "God is the state, the state is God." Who says that? - Trotsky. - Oh. That's alright. I thought maybe you did. I like that. That's good. It's nice and short. It's good for printing. G-O-D space I-S space.. 'G-O-D space I-S space T-H-E space..' And so, the beautiful princess came into the castle. - And kissed her mother. - Hello, dear. And her father. And her grandfather. Hi, guys. - Darling. - What do you think? They turned into the Sycamore family. - Surprised. - Alice, I like it. - Oh, do you? - 'It's nice and summery.' Where's you get it? Just took a little walk during lunch hour. You're taking a lot of walks lately. That's the second new dress. Well, I like to brighten up the office once in a while. I'm know as the Kay Francis of Kirby and Company. Ha ha. So tell me what's new around here, in the way of plays and snakes, fireworks, ballet dancing? - Going back to the war play. - Really, mama? Oh, Ed, play that Beethoven thing you wrote. - Alright. - 'Alice.' You can mail a letter all the way from Nicaragua now for only two pesetos. - Really? - Listen to this. "Kenneth, my virginity is a priceless thing to me." That's a good line I can give that to Cynthia in the monastery. Oh, isn't this lovely, Alice? Listen, a little louder, Ed. Oh, listen, people, listen, listen. Yes, dear. I'm not home to dinner. A young gentlemen is calling for me. - Really. - That's nice. Why don't you both come to dinner? No. I want him to take in easy doses. I've tried to prepare him, but don't make it any worse. Don't read him any plays, mother. And don't let a snake bite him, grandpa. Because I like him. And I wouldn't dance for him, Essie because.. ...we are going to the Monte Carlo ballet tonight. Can't do anything. Who is he? President of the United States? No, he's vice president of Kirby and company. Mr. Anthony Kirby Jr. - The boss's son? - Yes, the boss's son. Just like the movies. That explains the new dress. And why you haven't been home for dinner. Why, Sherlock Holmes. Alice, are you going to marry him? Yes, mother. Yes, I am. Tonight. I've to go and put on my wedding dress. - Oh. - Is he good looking? Oh, yes, in a word. Oh, nuts. What time is it, huh? Oh, I don't know. Does anybody know what time it is? Mr. DePinna might know. Was 5 o' clock a couple of hours ago. I know better than to ask you people. - Let me know when he comes? - Of course, dear. Oh, yes. I know. I mean the minute he comes. - Why, of course. - Be sure. [instrumental music] Well, what do you think? She seems to like him, if you ask me. I should say so, she's got it bad. Wouldn't it be wonderful if she marries him? We could have the wedding, right in this room. [instrumental music] [doorbell ringing] Oh, there he is. Oh, Rheba, never mind I'll answer it. Now, remember what Alice said. Be very nice to him. Alright. Lets take a look at him. Well. Well, welcome. I'm Alice's mother. Do come in. - Welcome to our little home. - Thank you. Here we are. - This is Mr. Sycamore. - How do you do? Alice's father, this is her sister and her husband Ed Carmichael. - And that's her grandfather. - Hello. Now, give me your hat and make yourself right at home. I'm afraid you must be making some mistake. "Wilbur C. Henderson. Internal revenue department." - That's right. - What does he want? Does a Mr. Martin Vanderhof live here? Yes, sir. That's me. Well, Mr. Vanderhof, the United States government would like to talk to you about a little matter of income tax. Do you mind if I sit down? No, no, go right ahead. (Alice) 'Mother, is that Mr. Kirby?' No, no, dear, it isn't. It's an internal something or other. Mr. Sycamore. These things are not going off. Not here Mr. DePinna, grandpa's busy. Oh. Excuse me. Well, Mr. Vanderhof.. We've written you several letters on the subject but we've had no reply. Oh, I put those letters away. I told you they were from the government. According to our records, Mr. Vanderhof you've never paid an income tax. - That's right. - Why not? Don't believe in it. - Well, you do own property? - Yeah. - From which you receive income. - That's right. Of between three and four thousand dollars. About that. Well, it seems, Mr. Vanderhof, that you owe the United States government 22 years back income tax. Now, wait a minute. You can't go back that far. That's outlawed. What was your name? What difference does that make? Ever file an income tax return? No. What was your income last year? Twenty eight dollars and 50 cents. - Ain't that right, Essie? - Yes, sir. Mr. Vanderhof, uh.. You know there's quite a penalty for not filing an income tax return? Penalty? Uh, Mr. Henderson...let me ask you something. If I were to pay you this money, I don't say I'm gonna but if I did, what do I get? For example, if I go into Macy's and buy something they put it in front of me. There it is, I see it. What does the government give me? Uh...well...the government gives you everything. It protects you. - What from? - Invasion. Foreigners that might come over here and take away everything you've got. I don't think they'll do anything like that. Well, if you didn't pay your income tax, they would. How do you think the government keeps up the army and the navy? All those battleships? Mr. Henderson, we haven't used battleships since the Spanish American war. What we got outta that was Cuba. We gave that back. I wouldn't mind paying if it was something sensible. Sensible? What about congress, supreme court? The president, we've got to pay them, haven't we? Not with my money, no sir. Now, wait a minute. I didn't come here to argue with you. All I know is that you haven't paid an income tax and you've got to pay it. Well, they've got to show me. We don't have to show you, I just told you. All those buildings down in Washington. Interstate commerce, the constitution. Interstate commerce? What's interstate commerce anyhow? There are 48 states, see. Without any interstate commerce, nothing could move from one state to the other. See. Well, have they got fences? No, they don't have fences, they've got laws. My God, I've never come across anything like this before. Oh, I might pay about $75, that's all it's worth. You will pay ever cent of it, just like everyone else. And let me tell you something more. You'll go to jail if you don't pay. Do you hear? That is the law and if you think you are bigger than the law you've got another thing coming. You will hear from the United States government and that is all that I can say. Where's my hat? - Look out for the snakes. - Snakes? Snakes. [instrumental music] [both laughing] - It's working now. - What did you think of that? I liked it. My goodness, he was mad, wasn't he? - Who? - No, it's not his fault. - Just his ridiculous job. - He left his hat. - Who? - Wait a minute. What size is that? - Seven and an eighth. - Just right for me. [bell ringing] Oh, my goodness. This must be Mr. Kirby. - Better make sure this time. - Yes, I will. I hope he's good looking. - Oh. - Oh. Good evening. How do you do? Are you Mr. Anthony Kirby, Jr.? Yes. Well, do come in. We've been expecting you. - Come right in. - Thank you. This is really Mr. Kirby. Oh, I'm Mrs. Sycamore, Alice's mother. - How do you do? - And this is Mr. Sycamore. - How do you do? - How do you do? And this is her grandfather. - Hello. - Hello. And her sister and her sister's husband. - Hello. - How do you do? - Fine. - Well, now you know us all. Give me your hat and please, make yourself comfortable. Thank you. (Alice) 'Mother, is that Mr. Kirby?' Yes, it is. And he's lovely. 'I'll be right down.' - Oh, I'm sorry. - Sorry. Oh, I hope I'm not keeping you from dinner. No, no, not at all. Would you like a tomato? No, thank you. Ooh, would you like a piece of candy? No, no, no, thanks. Oh, I forgot to introduce Mr. DePinna. Mr. DePinna, Mr. Kirby. - How do you do? - How do you do? I read about your father in the papers the other day. Didn't he get indicted or something? Well, hardly that, he just testified before the securities commission. - Oh. - Oh, why yes, of course. I'm sure there wasn't anything crooked about it, Mr. DePinna. As a matter of fact Alice has often told us what a lovely man your father is. Well, I know. I know father couldn't get along without Alice. She knows more about the business than any of us. You're awful young Mr. Kirby, aren't you? To be vice-president of a big place like that. You know what that means, vice-president. All I've got is a desk with my name on it. Is that all? Don't you get a salary? A little. More than I'm worth, I'm afraid. Now, you're being modest. Uh, sounds kinda dull to me. Wall Street. Do you like it? Oh, well, the hours are short and I really haven't been there very long. Just out of college, huh? Yes, I-I.. Yes, I knocked around for a while first. Just sort of had fun and uh.. Well, now the fun's over. Well, you've had a very good start, Mr. Kirby. Vice-president and a rich father. It's not my fault, is it? [laughing] Well, I suppose now you're ready to settle down and get married. Come, come now, Penny. I'm sure Mr. Kirby knows his own mind. All I meant was that he's bound to get married. And suppose the wrong girl gets him. Well, here I am. A vision in blue. - Hello. - Hello. Apparently, you've all had time to get acquainted. Yes, indeed. We've been having a delightful conversation about love and marriage. Oh, dear. I'm sorry. Came down as fast as I could. No, I didn't mind in the least. Damn! Those flies in the kitchen. 'Damn it!' Oh, Alice. You look beautiful. Where you going? I'm going out, Rheba. Oh, steppin', huh? [bell ringing] That would be Kolenkhov. Oh, we better be going, Tony. It was very nice meeting you both and mister.. [singing in foreign language] - Mr. Kolenkhov. - My little, Rhebishka! * Coochi-coochi-koo ** I will make of you a great ballerina. One of the great ones. Good evening, everybody. (in unison) Good evening, Mr. Kolenkhov. Bullseye. Whoa! Whoa. - Oh. - My little Alice. [clucking] No, Mister.. Never, never have I seen you look so magnificent. - Oh. - Can I kiss your cheeks? Mr. Kolenkhov, this is Mr. Kirby. This is Essie's dancing teacher, Tony. - How do you do? - How do you do? I've practiced today, Mr. Kolenkhov. Oh, my.. Will you pardon us, Mr. Kolenkhov? We're going to the Monte Carlo Ballet. - Oh, Monte Carlo Ballet. - Yes. - It stinks. - 'Ah, yes.' Well, goodbye, everybody. (in unison) Goodbye. Glad to have met you all. Yes. Monte Carlo Ballet. Madame Sycamore, darling woman. - Yes, indeed lovely. - Thank you very much. Mr. Kirby, I meant. Oh, him? Of course. Dinner! [indistinct chattering] Penny, I thought you were getting personal there. (Penny) Oh, come on. - Grandpa. - How do you like me new hat? - Oh, magnificent. - The government gave it to me. 'He looks like a cousin of mine, Mr. Kirby.' Oh. If we have the wedding here I'll put the alter right where the snakes are. You wouldn't mind, would you, Grandpa? Not if the snakes don't. [indistinct chattering] [tapping glass] Quite, everybody. [tapping glass] Quite please. Well, sir, we've been getting along pretty good for the quite a while now. We're certainly much obliged. Remember, all we ask is to go along to be happy. Of course, we all want to keep our health. But as far as anything else is concerned.. ...we'll leave it to you. Thank you. [indistinct chattering] [indistinct chattering] [instrumental music] I could see them dance every night. I think they are marvelous, aren't they? Oh, they are. But, of course, walking inside the theater gives me a thrill. Hmm. It's been so lovely tonight. I hate to have it over. Oh! Ah, is it...over? - Do I have to go? - No, you don't have to. No, I don't. Good. Come have a cold drink. Wonderful. I'll go see what's in the icebox. You wanna come along? I'd follow you to the ends of the earth. Hmm. Oh, just the kitchen's enough. Oh, say yes. I like it. Mm-hmm. You do, huh? Well, Mr. K., good thing you're not hungry. An icebox full of cornflakes. That give you a rough idea of the Sycamore's. [chuckles] - Oh my God! - My gosh I'm.. Oh, dear. I'll take mine in the glass, if you don't mind. [chuckles] - Here you are. - Thank you. Now, uh.. I'd like to offer a toast. Oh. Ms. Sycamore, to you. Oh, thank you. Mr. Kirby, to you. [bang] What was that? Oh, it's quite alright, Tony. It's only father. Oh, this time of night? Anytime of night. Anytime of day. - Oh, it is very late? - Yeah. I suppose I ought.. Yep. [instrumental music] - I don't wanna go. - I don't want you to go. - Okay. I won't. - Good. Ahem, when you're gonna get your vacation? - Oh, last two weeks in August. - I might take mine then, too. - Oh, really? - What you gonna do? I don't know. Haven't thought about it. You gonna go away, you think? No. I might not. I like the city in the summertime. Hmm. So do I. You always go up to Maine, don't you? That's right. But I'm sure I would like the city in the summer. Wait, you know what I'm.. You know what I'm trying to say, Alice, I'd.. I'd love it if you were here. Well, it'd be nice if you were here, Tony. You know what you're saying, don't you? What? Like you'd rather spend the summer with me than with anybody else. [chuckles] It looks like that, doesn't it? Yeah. Well, if it's true about this summer h-how would you feel about.. ...the winter? I'd like that too. Then there's.. ...autumn and spring. That's the whole year. I haven't forgotten anything, have I? No. [instrumental music] (Penny) 'Alice!' Alice, is that you, dear? Oh, I wonder what time it is. Oh, Mr. Kirby. Good evening, Mrs. Sycamore. Oh, excuse me. Well, I had no idea. - I, uh.. - I mean, I mean.. I didn't mean to interrupt anything. (Tony) 'That's quite alright, Mrs. Sycamore.' I just came down to get a manuscript. Then, you can go right ahead. Oh, here it is. "Sex Takes A Holiday." - Well, goodnight, Tony. - Goodnight, Mrs. Sycamore. Oh, I think you could call me Penny. Don't you, Alice? Oh, well, at least I hope so. [laughing] [both chuckling] Oh. [bang] [sighs] Hmm. Do you know that you're more beautiful more lovely, more adorable.. ...than anyone else in the whole world? Don't, Tony. Alice, what's the matter? Alice, I don't understand. Listen, Tony, this is something I should have said a long time ago. But I didn't have the courage. I let myself be swept away because I loved you so. - Well, then what's wrong? - Oh, no, Tony. Listen, please. You're of a whole different world. A whole different kind of people. I don't mean money or socially. That's too silly, but.. Your family and mine? Tony, it wouldn't work.. [door closing] (Ed) Alright, have it your way. She can't dance. That's why they pay her all that money because she doesn't know to dance. I do not call it dancing what she does. Oh, hello. How was the ballet? - Oh, it was fine, Essie. - It was wonderful. - Hello, Ed. - Hello. Look, what do you people think? Ed and I went to see Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. Do you think that she can dance, Mr. Kirby? - Uh, yes. I always thought so. - Well, what does she do anyway? Now, you are Fred Astaire and I'm Ginger Rogers. - Essie. - Please, Essie. I just want to use him for a minute. Now, look, Mr. Kirby. Essie, we all agree you're just as good as Ginger Rogers. - You see, Ed? - Come on, Essie. We are buttin' in, alright? They've been together all evening. - Goodnight, Mr. Kirby. - Goodnight. - Goodnight, Mrs. Carmichael. - Goodnight. Goodnight. Hey, Essie, did you ask grandpa about us having a baby? Oh, yeah. He said to go right ahead. Now, you see? - That's what it would be like. - I didn't mind that. Anyhow we're not gonna be living with your family. - Just you and me. - No. It's not. It's never quite that. I love them, Tony. I love them deeply. I know they do rather strange things but they're gay and they're fun and I don't know there's sort of a...nobility about them. That may sound silly, but I mean the way they don't care about things other people give their whole lives to. Alice, now you're talking as though only you could understand and that's not true. Every family has got curious little traits. What of it? My father raises orchids at $10,000 a bulb. - Now, is that sensible? Huh? - No. And my mother believes in spiritualism, now that that's just as bad as your mother writing plays, isn't it? Uh-uh. It goes deeper, Tony. Your mother believes in spiritualism because it's fashionable. And your father raises orchids because he can afford to. My mother writes plays because eight years ago a typewriter was delivered here by mistake. - What of it? - Look at grandpa. Thirty five years ago he just decided to quit business. He could have been a rich man. But he said it took too much time. So for 35 years he's just collected snakes. And gone to circuses and concerts. I love you, Tony but I love them too. Some people could break away, but I couldn't, Tony. - It's no use. It's just no use. - Everybody's got a family. [scoffs] Not like mine. They want you to be happy, don't they? Of course, they do, but they can't change who they are. - I don't want them to change. - They don't have to change. They're charming, adorable people just as they are. Everything is going to work out. You're worrying about something that may never come up. Oh, Tony, am I? All that matters right now is that we love each other. - Now, that's so, isn't it? - Mm-mm. Hmm. Trust me. I mean.. ...after all.. '...we are engaged, aren't we?' What? Tony. - Oh, Tony. - That's what I wanted to see. I wanted to see a little gaiety around here. Oh, Tony. Ms. Sycamore, would you please tell me what it was about me that first took your girlish heart? - Ah, the back of your head. - What? I just liked it. What happened when I turned around? Oh, I got used that after a while. Oh. We're pretty lucky, aren't we? Hmm? I'm the luckiest girl in the whole world. Ah, isn't it wonderful that we work in the same office? I can dictate to you all day. Dear, Ms. Sycamore.. ...I love you. Oh, I love you. - I love-- - Shh. You. Mr. DePinna, that was a good day's work. That's worth 500 Yellow Devils 300 Willow Trees and 8 dozen Junior Kiddie Bombers. That's the best day we ever had. Pretty good, I'd say. Hello, Alice. Did you just come in? No, father, I've been home quite a while. Did you have a nice evening? I had a beautiful evening. Alice, I want you to take a look at this red fire we made. Turn off the light, Mr. DePinna. - I want her to get the effect. - Sure. But, father. Wait till you see this new red fire. It's beautiful. Yeah. What do you think? Beautiful, isn't it? Everything's beautiful, father. It's the most beautiful red fire in the world. (female #1) '"Alright," I said.' 'I looked him right in the eye when I said it.' "Alright," I said. "If you don't like it--" Ms. Wellington, I'm ready to read my play to you if you are. A minute, dearie. Just a minute. Oh, there's only one thing I hope you don't mind my mentioning it, Ms. Wellington but you don't drink when you're acting, do you? Just asking, of course. I'm glad you brought it up. The moment a play opens I never touch a drop. The minute I enter the stage door the bottle gets put away until intermission. Have you been on the stage a long time, Ms. Wellington? All of my life. I've played everything. Ever see "Peg O' My Heart?" Oh, yes. I saw it too. 'Good show.' [Ms. Wellington sighs] My! It's a hot night, ain't it? (Donald) 'You want me to open a window, Ms. Wellington?' Say, he's cute. [gasps] Ah, she's just acting that's all, Rheba. Ms. Wellington, I can read my play to you now. Alright, dearie. Alright. (Penny) 'I thought we'd go up to my room.' When I see snakes, it's time to lay down. Oh, no. Ms. Wellington, those snakes are real. - It's just grandpa's hobby. - Yes, they're grandpa's. - They only eat flies. - Follow me. Up to my room. If Ms. Wellington wants to spend the night-- Oh, no! Ms. Wellington, please. No, no. I hope.. - Ms. Wellington? - I think she's asleep. She's out like a light. Rheba, Ms. Wellington just passed out. Good. Do you think she's going to be alright? Yes, but I wouldn't cast her in the religious play. Well, I suppose I'll just have to wait. Penny, the next time you meet an actress on top of a bus I'd send her the play instead of bringing her home to read it. Ed, I'd wish you'd stop that printing and take the "Love Dreams" around. I'm just finishing up. You've gotta be back to play for me. I'm going. I'm going. Kolenkhov coming tonight? Yes. Tomorrow night's his night but I had to change it on account of Alice. Big doings tomorrow night, huh? You know why I'm so nervous? You'd think he was engaged to me instead of Alice. I wonder what they'll be like. His mother and father. - Alright. Guess who? - Don't tell me. - Cleopatra. - No. It's Eleanor Roosevelt. - Maybe it's the chin. - Ed, please, the "Love Dreams." The nice thing about these Erector sets is you can make so many different things with them. Last week it was the Empire State Building. - What is it this week? - It's a Queen Mary. Oh, that's lovely. It looks just like it. Mr. DePinna, could you look out the door see if there's a man standing out? Why? What for? Last two days when I've been out delivering candy I think this man's following me. - Ed, you're crazy. - No. I'm not. He follows me and he stands and watches the house. Really? I'll take a look and see. I don't see what anybody would follow Ed for? Well, there's a lot of kidnapping going on now, grandpa. Yes, but not of Ed. Well, did you see? There's nobody out there at all. - Are you sure? - Positive. I just saw him walk away. - You see what I mean? - It could have been anybody. Mr. Sycamore, you wanna go down, finish packing the fireworks? Yes. We have to take the stuff up to Mount Vernon. May I borrow some paper? I'm making a list for Rheba. - 'Yes, dear.' - Where's the stage manager? What's the matter with your actress friend? Oh, is she giving a performance? No, dear. She's not acting. She's really drunk. Essie, you're gonna give Rheba the kitchen all day tomorrow. - She'll need it. - Of course, Alice. I'll start some "Love Dreams" right now so I'll be ahead. Oh, thanks, dear. Mother, I'll be home at 3 o'clock tomorrow. You'll have everything down in the basement by then, won't you? The typewriter and the snakes. 'The xylophone, the printing press.' - And Ms. Wellington. - And Ms. Wellington. That'll give me time to arrange the table and fix the flowers. The Kirby's are certainly gonna get the wrong impression of this house. - You'll do that, won't you? - Yes, dear. Alice, I wouldn't worry so much. From what I've seen I'm sure the Kirbys are very nice people. And if it isn't so elaborate tomorrow, it's alright too. Darling, I'm not trying to impress them or pretend more than anything we're not. I.. - I just want it to go well. - No reason why it shouldn't. Alice, we're all going to do everything we can to make it a nice party. Oh, my darlings. I love you so much. You know you're the most wonderful family in the world. And I'm the happiest girl in the world. I'm-I'm.. I didn't know anybody could be so happy. He's so wonderful, mother. Just seeing him, you don't know what it does to me. Just seeing him, huh? For lunch, dinner, to 4 o'clock in the morning. At 9 o'clock in the morning you're at the office. There he is. Just seeing him, huh? I don't care. I'm in love. Rheba? Rheba? Nice seeing her so happy, isn't it? Yes. I remember when I was engaged to Paul how happy I was. And you know something, grandpa? I still feel the same way. I know. I know. That's the way Ed and Essie get along too, isn't it? And Donald and Rheba. Grandpa, do you think Mr. DePinna will ever marry anyone? Well, there's Ms. Wellington. Oh, you. Mrs. Sycamore, look what I found. Remember? [gasping] Why, of course. I remember. It's my painting of you as the discus thrower. - Look, grandpa. - I remember. Say, you've gone bald, haven't you, Mr. DePinna? Is it very noticeable? Well, there's still a little left up there. Well, that was a long time ago. Just before I stopped painting. Let me see eight years. Too bad you never finished it, Mrs. Sycamore. I always intended to, Mr. DePinna but I just started writing a play one day and that was that. I never painted again. Just as well. I was gonna have to strip next. My goodness, who would have thought the day I came to deliver the ice that I was gonna stay here for eight years? Nobody. The milkman was here for five. Just before you. - Say, why did he leave anyhow? - He didn't leave. He died. - Oh. - He was a nice man. Remember the funeral, grandpa? We never knew his name and we hard a hard time getting the certificate. What was the name we finally made up? Martin Vanderhof. We gave him your name. - Oh, yes. I remember now. - And it was a lovely idea. Otherwise he would never have got all those flowers. Certainly was. Didn't hurt me. Not bothered with mail anymore. Haven't made a phone call from that day to this. I wish you'd finish it sometime. I kinda like to have it. You know something, Mr. DePinna I'm gonna do some work on it right tonight. Say, will ya? [doorbell ringing] Yes. You go down in the cellar and put on your costume. Oh, and bring up the easel. - Is it still there? - I think so. Where did I put my palette and my brushes? Oh! Rhebishka. My little Rhebishka. Whoo! Good evening, Mr. Kolenkhov. Essie's in the kitchen. Madame Sycamore, I salute you. Bull's eye. [humming] [laughing] Tell me, grandpa, what am I going to do about Rhebishka? I keep telling her she would make a great toe dancer. But she laughs only. Oh, Mr. Kolenkhov, I can't get up on my toes. Not with my corns. [laughs] Rhebishka, darling. Oh, she could wear diamonds, this woman. She's a great woman, grandpa. - What's that? - A picture of Mr. DePinna. - Penny painted it. - It stinks. - I know. How do you like that? - What's that? She's a actress friend of Penny's. - I can't find my wig. - She's drunk, no? She's drunk, yes. How are you, Kolenkhov? Magnificent. Life is chasing around inside of me like a squirrel. - It is, huh? - It is. I'm sorry I'm late, Mr. Kolenkhov. I'll get into my dance things right away. Tonight you will really work, my pavlova. Tonight we will take something new. Is she making any progress, Kolenkhov? Confidentially she stinks. Ah, as long as she's having fun. You sure do tickle Rheba, Mr. Kolenkhov. She's out there laughing her head off. - Donald, she's a great woman. - Yeah. Kolenkhov, look at this. Government gotta stop sending me letters. The United States Marshall's Office wants me down at the office there at 10 o'clock Tuesday morning. Uh-oh. The income tax, they have got you, grandpa. Yeah. I'm supposed to send them a lot of money to keep on Donald on relief. Is that right, grandpa? You gonna pay it from now on? That's what they want. I can come right here and get it instead of standing in line? No, you're gonna have to waste a full half hour of your time every week. I don't like it. Breaks up my week. He should have been in Russia during the revolution. When that came, then he would have stood in line, huh? The bread line. Woo! [sighs] Ah, grandpa. What they have done to Russia. Just think, The Grand Duchess, Olga Katrina she's a cousin of the Czar. She is now a waitress in Child's Restaurant. I ordered baked beans from her only yesterday. It broke my heart. It's a crazy world, grandpa. Oh, the world's not so crazy, Kolenkhov. The people in it. Life is pretty simple if you just relax. How can you relax in times like these? If people would relax, there wouldn't be times like these. That's just my point. Life is kind of beautiful if you just let it come to you. But people forget that. I know I did. I was right in the thick of it. Fighting, scratching clawing, regular jungle. And one day, it kinda struck me. I wasn't having any fun. So you did what? Just relaxed. 35 years ago, that was. I've been a happy man ever since. Good evening, Mr. Kolenkhov. Ah! My little Alice. I have not seen you to present my congratulations. Oh, thank you. May you be very happy and have many children. That is my prayer for you. Oh, that's quite a thought. Thank you. Oh, oh! [Alice humming] Love! Love is all that is left in the world, grandpa. There's plenty of that. And soon, Stalin will take that away, too. It seems so good to get into my art things again. They still look alright, don't they, grandpa? - Hmm. - Yes, indeed! You are a breath of Paris, Madame Sycamore. Oh, thank you, Mr. Kolenkhov. I can't stand it! It happened again. There was a fellow following me everywhere I went. Nonsense. That is just your imagination. No, it happens every time I've got to deliver the candy. Maybe he wants a piece of candy. [laughing] That's fine for you to laugh, but he's following me. You do not know what following is. In Russia, everyone is following. I was followed right out of Russia. Mrs. Sycamore. Where do you want this? Well, just put the box right there and the easel over there. Ed, for tonight's lesson we use the first movement. Alright, we have Don on the flute. Mr. DePenna.. ...has something happened to your figure in these eight years? No, I don't think it's any.. ...different. I'm sorry, Mr. Kolenkhov, I couldn't find my slippers. We have a hot night for it, my pavlova but remember art is only achieved through perspiration, darling. Only made two bulls-eyes last night. Gotta do better than that. [instrumental music] Oh, grandpa! Are you ready? We'll begin. Now, pirouette, pirouette. Come now, pirouette, darling. It's been eight years now. Eight years, pirouette. At last, entre, entre.. No, grandpa, you cannot relax with Stalin in Russia. The Czar relaxed and what happened to him? He was too late. If the Czar had not relaxed-- Mr. Kolenkhov.. The grand duchess Olga Katrina would not be selling baked beans today. Mr. Kolenkhov.. I'm sorry, darling. We go back to the pirouette. [bell ringing] Could you pull your stomach in, Mr. DePinna? Free with the hands. Remember the whole body must work, sweetheart. The whole body, uh? And the music must also be free.. 'Rheba, Rheba..' (Kolenkhov) 'Okay, Donald, fortissimo on the floor.' Good evening. [Kolenkhov humming] [indistinct chattering] Ms. Sycamore? (Rheba) 'Ms. Sycamore.' Good evening. Grandpa? [Ms. Sycamore whistling] Good evening. How do you do? How do you do? - Are we too early? - No, no, no. Come right in. We're glad to see ya. Oh, yes. But we thought it was tomorrow night. - Tomorrow night? - Tomorrow? It's perfectly alright. Make yourselves at home. Tony, how could you-- I thought it was tonight. Really, Tony. This is most embarrassing. Please, don't let it bother you. - We weren't doing a thing. - Just a quiet evening at home. Oh, this is Alice's mother, Mrs. Sycamore. (Grandpa) 'Mr. Kolenkhov.' 'Alice's sister, Mrs. Carmichael' - Mr. Carmichael. - 'Hello.' And Mr. De Penna. Don't mind my costume. I'll take it right off. Mr. De Penna, tell Mr. Sycamore to come right up. The Kirby's are here. Tell him to put his pants on. Alright. Excuse me. Oh, Alice! Alice, dear! Would you come down for a moment, dear? We have a surprise for you. Can I take your wrap? - Oh, thank you. - Ed? Do be seated, Mrs. Kirby. Well, thank you. If you're absolutely sure that we're not interrupting. Oh! [screaming] (Grandpa) 'That's alright, Mrs. Kirby.' [indistinct chattering] I hate snakes. 'Ed, put the snakes in the kitchen.' We're so used to having them around the house. I'm sorry to trouble you, but snakes happen to be.. ...duh.. It's okay. It's okay. (Ed) 'Don't be scared.' I feel very uncomfortable about this, Tony. How could you do this? Oh, Mr. Kirby, anybody can get mixed up. Penny, how about some dinner for these folks. They did come to dinner. Oh, please don't bother. We're really not hungry at all. No bother. Ed, Ed? Would you tell Donald to go down to the A and P and get six bottles of beer and let's see and some canned salmon. Do you like canned salmon, Mr. Kirby? Uh, please don't trouble, Mrs. Sycamore. I have a little indigestion anyway. I'm sorry. What about you, Mrs. Kirby? Do you like canned salmon? Uh! Oh, I'm, uh.. ...very fond of it. Oh, you can have frankfurters, if you'd rather. Either one will do. We'll have frankfurters. and some canned corn and Campbell's soup. - Got that? - Yes. - Tell him to hurry. - Right. The A and P is at the corner and frankfurters don't take any time to boil. (Grandpa) 'This is Alice's father, Mr. Sycamore.' - Mr. and Mrs. Kirby. - How do you do? Forgive my appearance. Excuse me. 'This is Mr. Sycamore's busiest time of the year.' [gasping] Darling, I'm the most dull-witted person in the world. I thought it was tonight. Ha ha! Why, Tony, how could you.. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry, I thought.. - Alice. - Did you, uh.. I'm not very, uh.. - Have you all met each other? - Yes, indeed. How do you do, Alice? How do you do, Mrs. Kirby? I'm afraid I'm not very presentable. Oh, no, you look lovely. Well, of course she does. Don't let this bother you. We've only met each other one night sooner, that's all. Of course. I was planning such a nice party tomorrow night. Well, we'll all come again tomorrow night. [laughing] (Tony) 'There you are.' Am I forgiven? Well, I guess so. Huh. Well, I guess we better see about getting these people some dinner. Excuse me. Excuse, excuse.. [door slams] That's all been attended to. Mother, what did you send out for? Because Mr. Kirby suffers from indigestion. He can only eat certain things. No, no. It's not as serious as all that. Perhaps it's not indigestion at all, Mr. Kirby. Perhaps you have stomach ulcers. Don't be absurd, Mr. Kolenkhov. You mustn't mind Kolenkhov, Mr. Kirby. He's a Russian. Russians are inclined to look at the dark side. Alright, I'm a Russian. But a friend of mine, a Russian, died from stomach ulcers. Really? Please, Mr. Kolenkhov, Mr. Kirby has indigestion, that's all. Alright, let him wait. Do sit down, Mr. Kirby. Make yourself comfortable. Thank you. Uh! Sorry. Tell me, Mr. Kirby, how do you find business conditions? You think we're pretty well out of the depression? Yes, I think so. Of course, it all depends. (Grandpa) 'But you do figure, things are still improving.' (Mr. Kirby) 'Broadly speaking, yes.' 'In fact, industries is now operating at 62 percent at full capacity, compared to 84 percent-- There was.. There was a young lady from Wheeling. Who had.. Hey! Hi, kitty. [indistinct] She.. That probably seemed strange to you people but, uh.. ...she's really not quite accountable for her actions. A friend of Mrs. Sycamore's. She came for dinner and she was overcome by the heat. Yes. Some people feel it more than the other. Maybe I better go upstairs and see if she's alright. Excuse me. Oh, yes, it's awfully hot, isn't it? Yes. You usually escape all this hot weather, don't you, Mrs. Kirby Up in Maine? Yes, as a rule. I had to come down this week, however, for the flower show. Mother wouldn't miss that for the world. That blue ribbon is her high spot for the year. I won a ribbon at a Flower Show once. For raising onions. Remember, Alice? That was a Garden Show, Essie. Oh, yes. I think she'll be alright now. Oh, please sit down. Has Donald come back yet? No, he hasn't. What is this? I didn't realize there were little children in the house. No, that's mine. Really? Well, I guess, every man has his hobby. Or do you use it as a model of some kind? No, I just play with it. You'd be better off if you had a hobby like that instead of raising orchids. Oh, do tell us about your orchids, Mr. Kirby. Do you know they take six years before they blossom, don't they? Think of that. Some take even longer than that. I have one coming along now that I've waited 10 years for. - I remember one-- - Oh, here we are. Did you get everything, Donald? Yes, ma'am. They didn't have frankfurters so I got pickled pigs feet. Never mind. Just take everything right into the kitchen. Oh, please do tell everyone about your orchids, Mr. Kirby. I know they'd love to hear it. And, uh, excuse me. It won't take a minute. You must be starved. Eh! Oh! No, thank you. That must be quite an expensive hobby, is it, Mr. Kirby? Raising orchids. Yes, it is. Then I need something to relieve the daily strain. After a week in Wall Street I'd go crazy if I didn't have something. Lot of men I know have yachts for that very reason. Well, why don't they give up Wall Street? How's that? Oh, I was, I was just joking. Well, I think it's necessary for everyone to have a hobby. Of course it's more to me than a hobby. But my great solace is spiritualism. Mrs. Kirby, everybody knows that's a fake. (Paul) 'Now, now, Penny.' Remember you've got a few hobbies of your own. Yes, but they're not silly ones. I, I really don't think it matters what the hobby is. I think the important thing is to have one. Ah, but to be ideal.. ...a hobby should improve the body as well as the mind. The Romans were a great people. Why? (Kolenkhov) 'Why?' What was their hobby? Rassling. In rassling, you have to think quick with the mind. Act quick with the body, ah. I'm afraid, wrestling isn't practical for most of us. I wouldn't make a good showing as a wrestler. [indistinct] You could be a great rassler. You have the body for it. Here, look at this body, grandpa. Is this the body of a rassler? Yes or not? Watch this, Mr. Kirby. [grunting] [Mrs. Kirby screaming] [indistinct chattering] Kirby, are you hurt? - Oh! - Fantastic! His glasses, his glasses. Thank you. They're broken. Whoa, whoa! I'm sorry, Mr. Kirby. But when you rassle again you will of course not wear your glasses. I do not intend to wrestle again-- Don't be silly! How could you do such a thing? Why didn't somebody stop him? If you don't mind, we better be going. - Mother. - Mrs. Kirby, please don't go. Mr. Kirby, please don't go. I've ordered some nice scrambled eggs and a salad. - Please don't go. - Alice, Alice, it's alright. We're not going. Now, father you sit down. [Mr. Kirby grunting] After you, Alice. Well, that was exciting for a minute, wasn't it? [whispering] I'm awfully sorry, Mr. Kirby. What did I do that was so terrible? I threw him on the floor. What, it killed him? Alice! Alice! - Ms. Alice. - Excuse me. What is it, Rheba? Child, the eggs got felled on the sink. Make some more, Rheba. - I got no more. - Then send Donald out for some. - Okay. - Quick, and be quick. Oh, I'm so sorry. There'll be a little delay but everything will be ready in just a moment. Whoosh! [laughing] Oh, I know! While we're waiting, why don't we all play a game? I know a wonderful trick with a glass of water. 'Mr. Kolenkhov.' Mr. and Mrs. Kirby will love this game. It's perfectly harmless. (Alice) 'What is it, mother?' I'm afraid, I'm not very good at games, Mrs. Sycamore. But any fool can play this game, Mr. Kirby. All you do is write your name on a piece of paper. There now, you write your name on that piece of paper. You'll love it. Now, Tony, would you pass these around? Here you are, grandpa. Now you do the same, Mrs. Kirby. Mother, what is this game? We used to play it in school. It's called, um.. Hmm, forget me not. Now, then, I'm going to call out five different words. Just anything at all. And as soon as I say each word you write down the first thing that comes into your mind. Is that clear? For instance, I might say "grass" and you might put down "green." (Penny) 'Just whatever you're thinking. See.' Or I might say, uh, "table" and you might put down "chair." You see? It shows peoples reactions to different things You see how simple it is, Mr. Kirby? Then are we all ready? (all) 'Ready!' Now, remember, you must play fair. Must put down the first thing that comes into your mind. I understand. Alright. Now then, are we ready? (all) Ready. The first word is, "potatoes." (Penny) 'Po-ta-toes!' (Penny) 'Ready for the next one?' - Bathroom. - Mother. Bathroom. - Got that? - Yeah. Alright, the next word is.. ...lust. Mother, I don't think-- Now, Alice, that word is perfectly alright. Mother, it's not alright. I don't know. I think that's a perfectly fair word. There, you see? You mustn't interrupt the game, Alice. Excuse me. What was the last word, Mrs. Sycamore? "Lust," Mr. Kirby. I've got it. Quite a game, isn't it? (Penny) 'Grandpa. Ha ha!' Now, all ready? - 'Ready.' - 'Let's have it.' Honeymoon. Ha ha ha! Oh, excuse me. (Penny) 'Alright.' Um, the last word is "sex." - Mother. - Everybody got "sex?" - Alright. - Yeah. (Penny) 'Alright, give me all your papers.' (Penny) 'Thank you, grandpa.' There we are. Thank you, dear. Mr. Kirby, give me your paper. Well, what happens now? This is the best part. I read out your reactions. I see. Very interesting game. I knew you'd like it. I'll read your paper first, Mr. Kirby. I'm gonna read Mr. Kirby's paper first. (Penny) 'Listen, everybody, this is Mr. Kirby.' Potatoes, steak. That's very good, Mr. Kirby. You see how well that goes together? (Penny) 'Steak and potatoes.' I just happened to think of it. "Bathroom, toothpaste." (Penny) 'Well, hmm.' "Lust, unlawful." Hmm, isn't that nice? "Honeymoon, trip." Yes. "Sex, male." Oh, yes, of course. You are. Oh, Mr. Kirby. That's really a wonderful paper. Thank you. You know, this is more than just a game. It's sort of a, an experiment in psychology, isn't it? Yes, it is Shows you just how your mind works. Now, we'll see how Mrs. Kirby's mind works. (Penny) 'This is Mrs. Kirby's, everybody.' "Potatoes, starch." Oh! I know just what you mean, Mrs. Kirby. "Bathroom, Mr. Kirby." How's that? "Bathroom, Mr. Kirby." I don't quite follow that, dear. Well, I don't know. Well, I just thought of you in connection with it. Well, after all you are in there a good deal, Anthony. Bathing and shaving and.. Well, you do take a long time. Indeed. I didn't realize I was being selfish. Please go on, Mrs. Sycamore. I think this is a silly game, we oughta stop. - Yes, I think so too. - No, no don't. Please, go on. Alright, now, let's see. "Lust, human." Really, Miriam? Well, all I meant, Anthony was that lust is after all a human emotion. I disagree, Miriam. Lust is not a human emotion. It's depraved. Very well, Anthony, I'm wrong. I think this is the most pointless game. We oughta stop. - Yes. - No, no, no, no. Please. Go on, I find this a rather interesting game. (Anthony) 'Uh, what was the next word, Mrs. Sycamore?' "Honeymoon." Yes, and, uh, what was Mrs. Kirby's answer? [Kolenkhov chuckling] "Honeymoon...dull". [chuckling continues] Did you say "dull?" Well, what I meant, Anthony, was that, uh.. ...hot springs was not very gay that season. All those old people sitting on the porch all afternoon and nothing to do at night. Father, this is only a game. And a very illuminating game. Please go on, Mrs. Sycamore. This one is alright, Mr. Kirby. "Sex, Wall Street." Wall Street? What did you mean by that, Miriam? I don't know what I meant by that, Anthony. Nothing! Must've meant something or you wouldn't put it down. It was the first thing that came into my head. But what did you mean, Marie? "Sex, Wall Street." I don't know what it means, Anthony. It's just that you're always talking about Wall Street. Even when.. I don't know what I meant. Would you mind if we leave? This game's giving me a headache. I understand, Mrs. Kirby. Perhaps we'd better postpone the dinner, if you don't mind. But you're coming tomorrow night, aren't you? I'm afraid, we've an engagement-- We'd better postpone the whole affair for a while. I think we're being very ungracious. No, of course we will stay tonight. - Tony, everyone understands. - Mother. I don't, father. We oughta stay. No, Tony. We were fools to think it would work. It won't. Mr. Kirby, I won't be at the office tomorrow. I won't be there anymore at all. - 'Alice.' - Miriam. (Tony) 'Alice what're you talking about?' Very nice to have met all. - Night. - Yes, lovely. (all) Goodnight. Tony, are you coming? No. Father, I'm not. I see. Your mother and I'll wait for you at home. Goodnight. Alright, stay right where you are everybody. Don't move. Which one is it? Hey! What are you doing? [indistinct chattering] What's your name? Carmichael. I've not done anything. This seems high-handed to me. What's it all about? Department of Justice. My goodness, J-men! - What've you done? - Haven't done anything. - Where's the cellar? - Right through there. Mac, check the cellar. Jim, get a look upstairs. - What've you done? - I've not done anything. - Yeah. Ever see these before? - Yes. Those are just my circulars. - You print this stuff, huh? - Yes, sir. Put it into candy boxes to get it into peoples homes. - Love dreams. - I don't mean anything. You don't, huh? Dynamite the capital. Dynamite the White House. Dynamite the Supreme Court - God look at state. - I didn't mean it. Ask grandpa. Officer, printing it this-- Hold it! What've you got there? - Eggs. - Officer. The government's in no danger from Ed. Printing's his hobby. He'll print anything. He will, uh? [indistinct chattering] Will you let me get my pipe? Shut up, you. We were right. They've enough powder to blow up the whole city. You better let me get my pipe. He made me-- [indistinct chattering] Everybody in this house is under arrest. [indistinct chattering] [indistinct singing] Who's that? Uh, that's my mother. [fireworks bursting] [indistinct chattering] [intense music] [dramatic music] [indistinct chattering] [music continues] Argh! [fireworks bursting] [dramatic music] [music continues] "They appeared in the Westside Court this morning "after spending the night in jail. "The defendants, 13 in all were brought before Judge Callahan "and given suspended sentences for manufacturing fireworks without a permit." Hmm-mm. I was in a cell with Mr. Kirby. Wow! Was he mad. Yeah, well, I reckon, he was. I suppose after all this Tony never gonna marry Alice. No, sir. And is too bad too. 'Cause Alice sure loves that boy. I don't know what to do with all this food. Ain't gonna be no party tonight. I'll eat it. Well, they ain't. They're all broke over Alice. What she wanna go away for anyway? Where she going? I don't know. To a mountain some place. Too bad, eh? Sure is. Not even a balloon left, look. - Oh! - Oh, that's too bad. How's your hand, Mr. DePinna? Better? Yes, it's better. Where's the olive oil, Rheba? It's over in the salad bowl. Well, hmm. She's going. Nothing anybody said could change her. Oh, she ain't gonna be gone long. Is she, Mrs. Sycamore? I don't know, Rheba. She won't say. It sure is gonna be lonesome around here without Alice. How do you feel, Mrs. Sycamore? Well, I'm alright, Donald. Just a little upset. Maybe if I do some work I'll feel better. Yeah, why don't you do that? [piano music] - She's going, Penny. - Yes, I know. Oh, no, no. Penny. I can't help it, Paul. Somehow I feel it's all my fault. No, it's more of my fault than it is yours. All these years I've been just going along enjoying myself. Maybe I should've been thinking more about Alice. Oh, you mustn't talk that way, Paul. You've been a wonderful father, and husband, too. No, I haven't. Maybe if I had.. been I don't know, an architect. Something Alice could have been proud of. You know I felt that all last night looking at Mr. Kirby. But we've been so happy. Maybe that's not enough. I used to think it was. I'm kinda mixed up now. What time is she going? Train leaves at half past seven. If only she'd see Tony I know he could persuade her. She won't. He tried all day. He's walking around the block again. I feel so sorry for him, too. Well, grandpa? Penny, Penny, let the girl alone. But, grandpa.. Suppose she does go the Adirondacks.. ...she'll be back. You can take just so much of the Adirondacks and then you come home. Grandpa, it's all so terrible. In a way. Has its bright side too. What do you mean? Well, Mr. Kirby getting into the patrol wagon for one thing and the expression on his face when he had to bunk with Donald. I'll never forget that if I live to be a 100. I warn you people I fully intend to if I can have things like that going on. It was even worse with Mrs. Kirby when the matron stripped her. There was a burlesque dancer there and she kept singing strip songs while Mrs. Kirby undressed. [laughing] I bet you Bar Harbor will seem pretty dull to the Kirby's this summer. I'll bring the big bag down when you want. Thanks. - Need any help, dear? - Oh, no thanks, grandpa. I'm just gonna press these. Would you like to take some candy along for the train? No, thanks, Essie. Alice, you could be alone here just as much as you could be in the mountains. You could just stay in your room all the time. Oh, no, thanks, mother. I-I just want to be by myself away from everybody. I love you all, you know that. I just, I just have to go away for a while. I'll be alright. Father, did you phone for a cab? No. I didn't know you wanted one. Oh, I told Mr. DePinna to tell you, didn't he tell you? Well, he told me and then I forgot. Oh, I wish I lived in a family where everybody didn't always forget everything. That behaved the way other people's families do. Why can't we be like other people? Roast beef, and two green vegetables on the table and a doily, and a place to bring your friends home.. Alice! Alice, would you please listen to me? 'Alice?' 'Alice! You're not being..' [screaming] Alice, you're not being fair! Alice! At least let me talk to you. Alice! 'Alice!' How are you feeling, Mr. DePinna? Any better? Well, it was. Everything burned up, huh, downstairs? Everything. And my Roman costume too. I told you there was a bright side to everything. Except my 22-years' back income tax. I get another letter every day. What are you gonna do about that anyhow, grandpa? Well, I had kind of an idea yesterday. Don't know if it'll work but I'm gonna try it. Good evening, everybody. Forgive me. The door was open. So I just.. I don't think I can take a lesson today, Mr. Kolenkhov. I just don't feel up to it. I'm sorry. Oh, but do stay to dinner, Mr. Kolenkhov. There's all that food out there. Somebody has to eat it. I will be happy to Madam Sycamore! - Here you are. - Oh, thank you. Now, I wonder whether if I know you well enough to ask of you a great favor. Why, of course, Mr. Kolenkhov. Yes. Well, you've heard me talk about my friend. The Grand Duchess Olga Katrina. Yes. She's a great woman, the Grand Duchess. Her cousin was the Czar of Russia, and today this woman is a waitress in Childs' Restaurant, Times Square. Look, I tell you, Madam Sycamore, this woman has not a had a good meal since before the revolution. She must be very hungry. Yes. Yes, and today the Grand Duchess not only has her day off Thursday but it is also the anniversary of Peter the Great. A remarkable man! Oh, if you mean you want the Grand Duchess to come to dinner we'd be honored. Oh, yes! Oh, in the name of the Grand Duchess, I thank you. Well, I can't wait to meet her. Where is she now? She's outside in the street waiting. I bring her in. I tell ya, if things like this keep going on I want to live to be a 150. The Grand Duchess Olga Katrina. * Row row row row ** Your Highness, permit me to introduce. Madam Sycamore. Ooh. Mr. Sycamore. Madam Carmichael. Mr. Carmichael. (Kolenkhov) 'Grandpa.' And Mr. DePinna. Ooh. Oh, Your Royal Highness, we are honored to receive you. I'm most happy to be here. How soon is dinner? [instrumental music] Dinner will be quite soon, Your Highness. Very soon. I do not mean to be rude but I must be back at the restaurant by 8 o'clock. I'm substituting for another waitress. - Well, won't you sit down? - Thank you. You're most kind. I will make sure that you're on time, Your Highness. Thank you, Kolenkhov. Please be seated. You know, Highness, I think you waited on me in Childs' once. The 72nd Street place? No, no. That was my sister. The Grand Duchess Natasha. I work in Times Square. Oh! Quite a lot of your folks living over here now, aren't they? Oh, yes. Many. My uncle, Grand Duke Sergei, he is an elevator man at Macy's. A very nice man. Then, there is my cousin, Prince Alexis. He will not speak to the rest of us because he works at Hattie Carnegie. He is in ladies' underwear. When he was selling hot dogs at Coney Island then he was willing to talk to you. Kolenkhov, our time is coming. My sister, Natasha is studying to be a manicurist. Uncle Sergei they have promised to make floorwalker. And next month I am to be transferred to the Fifth Avenue Childs'. From there it is only a step to Schraffts'. Then we will see what Prince Alexis says. I think you've got him. You are telling me? [laughing] Oh! Oh, Your Highness, did you really know the czar? Personally, I mean. Of course. He was my cousin. It was terrible what happened. But perhaps it was for the best. Where could he get a job now? Tell me, Grand Duchess, is it true what they say about Rasputin? Everyone wants to know about Rasputin. Yes, my dear sir. It is true...and how. You don't say. Madam Sycamore, we have to watch the time. Oh, yes. I must not be late. The manager does not like me. He is a communist. Well, we'll hurry things along. Essie, why don't you go out in the kitchen and see if you can help Rheba? I will help too. I am a very good cook. But, Your Highness, not on your day off! I do not mind. - Where is your kitchen? - Right through there. But you're the guest of honor, Your Highness. But I love to cook. Come, Kolenkhov. If they have got sour cream and pot cheese I will make you some blintzes! Oh, blintzes! Blintzes! Now we show you something pavlova. Say, the Duchess is alright. Maybe I can help her. She's got a great face for a mask, don't you think? She's really a very nice woman! Considering that she's a Grand Duchess. Wonderful, isn't it? What some people go through and still keep kinda gay too. (Tony) 'No, Alice.' She made me forget everything for a minute. Ed, will you please go up and bring my other bag down? Don't you do it. Ed, please. Alright, Ed. Alright go. Bring it down. Do you know that you've got the stubbornest daughter in all 48 states? [doorbell dings] Oh, that must be the cab. If it is, it's certainly a wonderful service. Alice, is Tony here? Yes. Yes, he is. Come in, Mr. Kirby. Thank you. Good evening. - Good evening. - How do you do? Forgive the intrusion. Tony, I want you to come home with me. Your mother is very upset. Alright, father. Goodbye, Alice. Goodbye, Tony. I need hardly say that this is as painful for Mrs. Kirby and me as it is for you people. I'm sorry, but I'm sure you understand. Uh, yes, and...in a way, no. I'm not the kinda that tries to run other people's lives. The face is, I don't think these two young people have as much sense as we have. Grandpa, would you please not do this? Please, Alice. I'm talking to Mr. Kirby. A cat can look at a king, can't he? I'll call the cab. Alice, do you want me to do that for you, dear? Now, Mr. Kirby, I suppose after last night you think this family is kinda crazy, don't ya? No, I wouldn't say that. I'm not accustomed to going out to dinner and spending the night in jail. Well, you must remember, Mr. Kirby that, uh, you came on the wrong night. Now, tonight, I'll bet ya, nothing will happen at all. Maybe. Mr. Vanderhof, it was not merely last night that convinced Mrs. Kirby and me this engagement would be unwise. Father, I can handle my own affairs. Alice, for the last time.. ...will you marry me? No, Tony. I know exactly what your father means and he's right. No, he's not, Alice! You're in love with him, and you're not marrying him because we're the kind of people we are. Grandpa. I know. I know. You think the two families wouldn't get along. Well, maybe they wouldn't. But who's to say they're right and we're wrong? Grandpa, I didn't say that we were wrong. I only feel-- What I feel is that Tony's too nice a boy to wake up twenty years from now with nothing in his life but stocks and bonds. How's that? Yes. Mixed up and unhappy, the way you are. I beg your pardon, Mr. Vanderhof. I'm a very happy man. - Are you? - Certainly, I am. I don't think so. Where do you get your indigestion from? Happiness? (Martin) 'No, sir.' You get it because all your time is spent doing the things you don't wanna do. I don't do anything I don't want to do. Yes, you do, you said last night that by the end of the week in Wall Street you're pretty near crazy. - Why do you keep on doing it? - Why do I.. That's my business. A man can't give up his business. Oh, why not? You've got all the money you need. You can't take it with you. That's a very easy thing to say, Mr. Vanderhof. But I have spent my entire life building up my business. What's it got you? Same kind of mail every morning. Same kind of deals, same kind of meetings. Same dinners at night, same indigestion. Where does the fun come in? Don't you think there ought to be something more, Mr. Kirby? 'You must've wanted more than that when you started out.' We haven't got too much time, you know. Any of us. Well, what do you suggest I do? Live the way you do? Do nothing? Well, I have a lot of fun. Time enough for everything. Talk, walk, visit the zoo now and then, practice my darts. I even have time to notice when spring time comes around. 'I don't see anybody I don't want to.' 'I don't have six hours of things I have to do every day 'before I get one hour to do what I like in.' And I haven't taken bicarbonate of soda in 35 years. What's the matter with that? What's the matter with it? Suppose everyone did that, a fine world we'd have. Everyone running off to zoos. Don't be ridiculous, Mr. Vanderhof. Who would do the work? There's always people to do their work. You can't stop them. Inventions, they fly the oceans. There's also people that go down to Wall Street because they like it. But from what I've seen of you.. ...I don't think you're one of them. (Martin) 'I think you're missing something.' I'm not aware of missing anything. I wasn't either till I quit. Oh, I used to go down to that office at 9 o'clock sharp. Right on the dot no matter how I felt. Used to lie awake at nights too. For fear I wouldn't get that contract. 'Used to worry about the world.' I got worked up about who was gonna be elected president. Cleveland or Blaine. Oh, it was very important to me at the time. But who cares now? What I'm trying to say, Mr. Kirby is.. ...that I've had 35 years that nobody can take away from me. Nobody. No matter what they do to the world. You see? Yes, I do see. And it's a very dangerous philosophy, Mr. Vanderhof. It's un-American. And it's exactly why I'm opposed to this marriage. I don't want Tony coming under its influence. What's the matter with it, father? What's the matter with it? Why, it's downright communism, that's what it is. Oh, you didn't always think so. I most certainly did. What are you talking about? I'll tell you what I'm talking about. You didn't always think so. Because there was a...there was a time that you wanted to be a trapeze artist. Wh...don't be an idiot, Tony. No, no, no. Yes, you did. I came across it in those letters that you wrote to grandfather. Do you remember those? No. How dare you read those letters? Mr. Kirby, I think it's wonderful. Did you wear tights? Certainly not. The whole thing is absurd. I was 14-years-old at the time. At 18 you wanted to be a saxophone player, didn't you? - Tony. - At 21 you ran away from home.. ...because grandfather wanted you to go into the business. It's all in the letters. You didn't always think so. - Well, well, well. - I may have had silly notions. Thankfully my father knocked them out of me. I went into the business and forgot it. There's still a saxophone in the back of your closet. There is? That's enough, Tony. We'll discuss this later. I wanna talk about it right now. I think Mr. Vanderhof is right. Dead right. I'm not going back to that office again. I've always hated it. I'm not going to continue. And I'll tell you something else.. ...I didn't make a mistake last night. I brought you here on purpose. - Tony! - Well, for heaven's sake. Because I wanted to wake you up. I wanted you to see a real family. As they really were. 'A family that loves and understands each other.' You never understood me. You never had the time. Well, I-I'm clearing out. I'm not gonna make your mistake. Clearing out? What do you mean? I'm not gonna be in the business because I'm your son. - I'm getting out. - What are you gonna do? I don't know. Maybe I'll be a bricklayer. At least I'll be doing something that I want to do. [doorbell dings] That must be the cab. Ask him to wait a minute, Ed. - Grandpa.. - Do you, do you mind, Alice? Mr. Kirby, Tony's going through exactly what you and I did when we were his age. 'If you listen hard enough you can hear yourself' 'saying the same words to your father 25 years ago.' We all did and we were right. How many of us would be willing to settle when we're young for what we eventually get? 'All those plans we make. What happens to them?' Think there's only a handful of the lucky ones that can look back and say that they even came close. So before they clean out that closet, Mr. Kirby I think I'd get a few good licks in on that saxophone. I beg your pardon but before I make the blintzes how many will there be for dinner? Your Highness, may I present my granddaughter Alice. Mr. Anthony Kirby, Mr. Kirby, Jr. 'The Grand Duchess Olga Katrina.' How do you do? - How do you do? - How do you do? Before I make the blintzes, how many will there be to dinner? Well, I...I'd make quite a stack of them, Your Highness. - Can't ever tell. - Good! The czar always said to me "Olga, do not be stingy with the blintzes." Mr. Vanderhof, who did you say that was? The Grand Duchess Olga Katrina. She's cooking the dinner. 'Speaking of dinner, Mr. Kirby, why don't you and Tony stay?' Please do, Mr. Kirby. We have all that stuff we were going to have last night. I mean, tonight. Going to be a pretty good dinner, Mr. Kirby. And it'll give us a chance to get acquainted. Why not stay? [dramatic music] How about it, father? Are we staying? Well, if you'd care to, Tony, I'd like to very much. Now if Alice will send away that cab, Mr. Vanderhof. How about it, Alice? Gonna be a nice crowd. Don't you think you ought to stay for dinner? I'm staying, Alice. The families ought to get to know each other. [instrumental music] Oh, you're wonderful, grandpa. I've been trying to tell you that for years. Oh, Tony. Well, I guess I'll tell the cab to leave, right? Grandpa, here's a letter for you. It was in the icebox. The United States Government. - How do you do, Mr. Kirby? - How do you do? Well, well, well. What is it, grandpa? The United States Government apologizes. I don't owe 'em a nickel. It seems I died 8 years ago. Well, what do they mean, grandpa? Remember the milkman buried under my name? Yeah. Well, I just told them they made a mistake and I was Martin Vanderhof, Jr. So they're very sorry and I may even get a refund. Oh, grandpa, you're an old crook. Sure. Pardon me, Mr. Vanderhof, how did you say you escaped the income tax? Tonight, my friends, you will taste food that will melt your mouths. - Hello, there. - How do you do? - Glad to see you. - What happened? - He's relaxing. - Why? Everything will be ready in a minute. You may sit down. Dinner, everybody! Let me hang that.. Oh, thank you. [indistinct chattering] Well, sir, here we are again. We want to say thanks once more for everything you've done for us. Things seem to be going along fine. Alice is going to marry Tony. (Martin) 'Looks as if they're going to be very, very happy.' 'Of course the fireworks blew up.' 'But that's DePinna's fault, not yours.' We've all got our health as far as anything else is concerned. We'll leave it to you. Thank you.
