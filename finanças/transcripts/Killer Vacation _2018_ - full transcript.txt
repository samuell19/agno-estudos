Okay, now we're going to bring our feet together... Find our sit bones and we're going to begin breathing... [gasps] There you are! I'd almost given up on you. How about a toast to celebrate our three month anniversary? What are you doing? Babe? What's going on? [glass shatters] Babe, what are you doing? Please... please! [muffled screaming] [glass shatters on pavement] [muffled screaming] [loud thud] Shayla? Aha! What are you doing with the sales report? Double checking it. Lindsey, you've got to stop going above and beyond. I mean, I know you're good, but you're making the rest of us look bad! I'm a team player, you know that. If there's something wrong with the numbers, I'm supposed to catch it, not you... Was there something wrong with the numbers? Not anymore... Thank you! Oh, I love you! I owe you dinner. Speaking of, some of the girls are coming by this weekend for wine and movie night. So, what do you say? Unless you already have plans with someone else? Nice try. Come on, Lindsey. At some point, you have to tell me who this mystery man is. Do I? You've been dating him for months now. What does he do? Is he hot? You know I don't kiss and tell. I know, and it makes me crazy. I understand your concern, but if you just look at these quarterlys... These results are not what we expected from you. And I'm doing my best to improve them. I'll take the report home this weekend. There's got to be some mistake. A mistake? Or we ordered more medical adhesive than we sold. And whose fault would that be? Jake, every year we send you to the medical conference as our representative. But this year, if these numbers aren't up I'm sending somebody else. As head of sales, I expect certain standards. As my son in law, I expect the best. I won't let you down, sir. Lindsey! You found the problem and you fixed it. You... Are amazing? I know. I'm kidding, anyone could have found it if they knew what they were looking for. Well, Andrea in accounting missed it. Um no, actually, she helped me figure it out. I'll mention that to Mr. Benson. In the meantime, this is a life saver. The numbers are up, Mr. Benson will be off my case, and I'll get to go to the desert. Because of you. You know what you need? A raise. Andrea, too! Andrea, too. I'll double check these numbers tonight, and if that's all good... Then I'm going to run it by Mr. Benson tomorrow. I'm crazy about you, you know that? What would I ever do without you? Did you meet with the lawyers? I did. So the divorce is going through? Not just yet... Look, I know we've only been dating for a few months, but I just need to know where we stand, when we can be open about our relationship. Otherwise, I start to look like the other woman. Which I would never be. I know, you're right. You shouldn't even have to ask. So then, what's the answer? It's tough. My marriage is over, but... Look... being separated from Gwen and living in the guesthouse is not the same as being divorced. For me, it's not. My lawyers have advised me to wait a little while longer. See if she cools off, let's me go without destroying me. Hey... I understand that it's hurting you. Look, I'm sorry that I ever got you involved. It was my choice. I love you. And I know it's soon to say, so if you don't feel comfortable saying it back, I understand. But I want you to know that this divorce is going to happen. Because I can't lose you. I just need you to be a little more patient with me. That's all. [camera snap] I think that I need a little time away from you. So you can work on whatever you need to work on. Please don't leave me. I'm not going anywhere. Hey, I'll be right here. But you need to finish what you started. [camera snap] [sighs] Lindsey... Mr. Johnson? Lindsey Harris from sales. I'm the new hire on your team. Oh yeah, Lindsey. We met last week. Hi... Hi. I was working late and I... Sorry if I'm interrupting, but I thought it looked like you could use a coffee? Thank you, Lindsey Harris from sales, but... I'm good. Lindsey? Actually I could use a friend right now, if you don't mind. Just to talk to... Okay. I just don't want to be alone. I understand. Can I ask you something, Lindsey? Are you married? No. Maybe you wouldn't understand. I was engaged once. What happened? I called it off. Why? He was jealous and controlling. And I realized that I'd rather live life alone than live like that. That's why I moved here. New city, new job, new life. That's smart. That's really smart. Me, I must be the stupidest man on the planet. Don't say that... I shouldn't even be talking to you about this. It's okay, I'm a good listener. I'm separated from my wife. And now that I want a divorce, she won't let me out. And you know the boss, the big boss Benson? It's his daughter. And he doesn't know we're separated, it's a big secret. She doesn't want me, but she doesn't want me to be happy, either. See that's what I was saying: you're smart. Lindsey Harris from sales. You got out. [alarm beeping] [laughing] Good effort. [door knocking] Hey! You changed your mind. Come here. I need to tell you something first. Is everything okay? Not really... Lindsey. Hey... Talk to me. What's the matter? You and I... Oh my god, don't cry... I'm not crying, I just... You know what I love about you? You're strong, you're smart. And you have such a good heart. And I know the situation with Gwen is affecting you. But you're still willing to stay with me, no matter what. Would you be willing to stay with me no matter what? What kind of a question is that, Lindsey? I just told you I loved you. I'm pregnant, Jake. What? That's impossible. We were careful. I know, I'm as surprised as you are. How long have you known? Last night I wasn't feeling well. I thought it was something I ate for lunch, so then I looked at the dates and realized that I'm late. You're late, that doesn't mean you're... I know, so then I went to the pharmacy and bought a test. It's positive! Yeah, but those tests aren't doctors. We need to get you a medical professional before you start ringing any alarm bells. The test is 99% accurate. That's not good enough for me. You need to go to your doctor and then we'll talk about it after. That's it? That's all you have to say? No, this is not happening. What's not happening? This! Lindsey, come on. That's not what I meant. You're making me seem like I'm a jerk here. You caught me off guard, that's all. It's not like I'm going to put a ring on your finger just because you're pregnant. You're right: that would be an odd choice considering you're already married. Lindsey... [door knocking] Hi. I owe you an apology. Can I come in? Lindsey. Lindsey Harris... No! Be serious, Jake. I've never been more serious about anything in my life. This pregnancy is a sign that I need to leave Gwen and be the man that I've always wanted to be. For you, for the baby. I've never loved anybody like I love you. You make me want to do the right thing. No. I just need a minute. This has been a lot. It's the scariest thing that's ever happened to me. And then today, to have you be so cold, and now you 180 and tell me that you want to have this baby in your life, what am I supposed to think? I don't know what you're supposed to think. What I can tell you... Is that the guy at the office... is just as scared. I want to believe you. I really do. But it's your actions that will convince me. Okay, I'll show you. I'm going to be the best father you've ever seen. And that baby is going to be loved, just like you. Lindsey, I'm excited! I feel like we should be popping champagne. I'm not exactly allowed. Right... Better idea: I leave for the conference tomorrow. Why don't you come with me? It'll be like our... baby moon. Our what? It's like a honeymoon without the booze. I can't, it would look weird. I don't care how it looks. I was a jackass today. The least I can do is whisk you off to the desert and make up for it. Would it make up for it? It would be a pretty nice start. Besides, you need to be pampered! There's a spa, there's comfortable beds, there's hiking. The hiking is amazing! But we can't. We can. We can get separate rooms so no one knows. And while I'm there, I'll hit up all the guys at the conference about a new job. Lindsey, this is the first day of our new life together. What do you say? Okay... yes. Yes! I love you, Lindsey. It's okay if you're not ready to say it back. I love you too, Jake. ♪ The sky is cut with wires ♪ ♪ As we go raving through ♪ ♪ The hills there are on fire ♪ ♪ And I'm in love with you ♪ Can we stay here every year? Yeah, if you like it. I love it, it's amazing. Good, well I'm going to go check in first. Okay. Mommy! Kiddo, come back here. Oh hi! I'm so sorry. You probably left your kids at home so you could enjoy a vacation. And here I am with my kid ruining everyone's peace and quiet! Thank you, I love this! Don't you worry about it, she's adorable? Aren't you adorable? There you go, nice to meet you. Say bye-bye! Bye-bye! You ready? I hope so... I meant to check in. For that, you have nine months to get ready. So do you. Meet me up there? Yeah, they're here together at the hotel. Yeah. Okay, see you at midnight. Jake? Ta da! Adjoining rooms. I'm impressed. So, which room do you want to sleep in? This room, the next room which is exactly like this room? It's your choice. I take it it's this room. I'll move in as soon as the bell boy gets the bags. And how long do you think until they get here? Not too soon, I hope. What? Your wedding ring. Of course, I'll take it off. I'm sorry. Now... where were we? Right here, together. Hello. Do you have a reservation? No, I don't. We have a big medical convention this weekend, but I'm sure we can find something. What's the most romantic room you have? The most romantic would be the Honeymoon Suite. Let's see if it's booked. You're in luck, it's available. I'll take it. I'm here to surprise my husband and I'm wondering if he's already checked in. Jake Johnson? Let's see... He did. Shall I let him know you've arrived? Like I said, I want to surprise him... [door knocking] Some photos you might like to see. Why thank you, Neil. You call this proof? This is a work relationship. A friendship at the very worst. They're staying here, together, at this hotel. Under separate rooms, but come on. That is hardly proof. They ordered room service. Stayed in all night. In their separate rooms. Separate, but adjoining. Look, I've been in this business a long time. They've got chemistry, no doubt about it. I'm not paying you for your opinion, Neil. I need hard evidence. The prenuptial clearly states, if he cheats, he gets nothing in the divorce. But if I have proof, then I have a bargaining chip. Either he stops the affair, or I share my bargaining chip with my lawyer and he's out on the street. No job, no money, no Gwen. And I know my husband. If his back is up against the wall, he will always choose me. So your job is to catch him with his back up against the wall. What do you expect me to do, hide in their closet? If that's what it takes, then that's what I want. As soon as Mr. Benson catches wind about you and the baby, I'm fired. The goal is to get as many job offers as possible. I thought we were going out today. Today is all about you and me. There's a little place in town. We can do some shopping, have some lunch and you know what's going to happen next? Some big, special hike? That's right, I'm going to take you away from the buildings and all the noise to my favorite spot in the desert. But since the conference is tomorrow, I'm going to go downstairs to the lobby and see if I can drum up some extra work. It's fine, I've got a little light reading to do anyway. See you in 20? Okay. [camera snapping] [camera snap] [muffled conversation] What a stunning store, that jewelry! Yeah, it's beautiful. I might have to go back and do some shopping. I love this whole town. I know, it's beautiful. - Yeah. - Thank you for bringing me here. Of course, you're welcome. Why are you wearing your wedding ring? Same reason we have two hotel rooms. If I don't have a job, I can't support the baby. And last I heard, babies are expensive. They like water and toys and clothes... All right, you're right. I'll take it off. You know what? It's just a ring. Maybe I'm being too hard on you. No no, you're right, Lindsey. That's the last time you're going to see it. I'm yours. I'd say you were hungry. Eating for two now. I can't stop thinking about that guy. If someone was taking pictures of you, could you blame them? I mean, you are beautiful. It was weird. I'm sure it was just a coincidence. That's him. This guy? Yes! Jake? Jake Johnson? It's me, Neil from Omni Corp. Don't tell me you don't remember... Yeah, your face looks a little familiar. You're lying. You're such a terrible liar. We met at a medical device demo. What was it? Medical adhesive? Sticky stuff... You were there with your wife, Gwen, right? Yeah, Gwen. Great gal that Gwen. I'm sorry, Jake you're so rude you haven't introduced us. I'm Neil. Lindsey. You work with this guy? I'm a sales rep at Benson Medical. Last I heard you were head of sales, Jake. Must be nice to have such young blood on the team. We've restructured. We work independently now. Hey tell Gwen I said hi for me. Great gal, that Gwen. I'm so sorry that happened. I guess I should get used to it. I'll always be the woman that came after that "great gal Gwen." No, that's not how it's going to be. I say we stop sneaking around, pretending like we're ashamed of something, because I'm not. I'm proud of you, but I want people to know that. Are you sure? If I can go back in time I'd tell that Neil creep, "Hey listen pal, this is my girlfriend Lindsey, and I love her." So starting tomorrow, wherever we are, whoever we meet, the ring is off, and you're on my arm. Seriously? Even at the conference? At the conference, at restaurants, at the spa, wherever we want to be. This is the start of our new life today. Let's do it right. I don't even know what to say. Wow. Hey, I'm glad you brought your tennis shoes, because this vista I'm going to take you to, it's gotta be one of the most beautiful views in all the desert. And when I get up there, I'm going to take my ring and I'm gonna throw it off the cliff. ♪ Take these hands, calloused and humble now ♪ ♪ Please understand though they promise to stay ♪ ♪ Well these boots cause vagabond souls ♪ ♪ That have planted such roots now ♪ ♪ It seems like they're walking away ♪ Come on babe, we've got this. Ten more minutes and we're up. I think I just need a second. I think I'm getting nauseous. You're okay. I've got that call with Mr. Benson soon. Do you think we should head back? No, I've got service. Do you need to turn around? No, let's do this. - Yeah? - Yeah! That's my girl! Hold on, slow down... Sorry, I'm just so excited to share this with you! ♪ Three by three we're feeding a fire ♪ ♪ That divides you and me ♪ Come on, slow poke. It's not me, it's the baby. I'm feeling super low energy. You want some water? Yeah. [phone cuts off] Oh come on! I'm out of cell range. I bet... we're out of everything range. I can't get this call without service. I don't think I can head back yet, we've been hiking for an hour, I need a break. I know. New plan. How about you go up around the rocks, take your time. Take a seat, enjoy the view. I'm gonna hike down the mountain for a few minutes and see if I can't get some service. Are you kidding? You could get lost. I'm not gonna get lost. I come here every year, it's my favorite spot. I'm going to be back before you know it. Okay? I love you. Love you too. Jake! Jake! Help! Jake? Grab on! I've got you. Come on. Keep coming. You've got this. Are you okay, ma'am? Yes. Thank you. Do you need medical attention? No I'm fine, I think it's just a couple of scratches. Listen, I know you just went through an ordeal, but I need to tell you that this trail is closed and the trailhead is clearly marked with signs. Hikers are not allowed up here. My boyfriend brought me here, it's his favorite spot. He comes here every year. That's not possible. This trail's been closed for eight years. It's extremely dangerous. What? Lindsey! Jake. What happened? I fell. What? She fell off the cliff. She could have died. You didn't see the signs? Signs? What signs? This trail is closed to the public. It's dangerous and there are signs posted clearly at the trailhead. You're bleeding. I'm fine. I'm such a jerk, I should never have left you up here alone. I'm so sorry. Let's just get back to the hotel. I need a bath. You take care now. Thank you. Lindsey, come on. I'm sorry. Lindsey, would you stop? Please just listen to me! I thought that you said you hike this every year. How could you never have seen that? Okay, maybe it's been a few years since I've hiked it. But can we please just try to get past this? I altready feel bad enough. I could have died out there, Jake. But you didn't, you're fine. Don't you think you're overreacting a little bit? So let me understand this. You think that me clinging for my life on the side of a mountain is overreacting? I am pregnant, Jake! And I'm scared to death that I could've lost that baby. And yet here you are, thinking this is about how many times you say you're sorry? Okay, I'm a jerk! All I was thinking about is trying to show you something beautiful. I wanted to impress you. But you're right. All I care about is you and the baby. I'll try to be more careful from now on. I promise. And I am sorry. Are you sure you're all right? I'm fine. We'll watch and... Darling! There you are. Gwen? What are you doing here? You were always asking me to come to the desert with you. And with the way things have been between us, I thought I'd surprise you. Surprise! This is uh, this is Lindsey Harris. She's in sales. Gwen Johnson, Jake's wife... Uh, sorry... Oh, my... You've met before I'm sure. No, I don't believe we have. Do you need a doctor? I'm fine. We were... I was just about to get cleaned up. I took a little fall when I was hiking, so... Yeah, I'm going to go to the room. I'll see you later, Jake? Yeah, at the meeting... No meetings tonight, Jake. I had daddy cancel everything so we can spend some time together. My father is my husband's boss. I guess that makes him your boss, too. Anyway Jake, I booked us into the honeymoon suite, and we have dinner reservations at six, so let's get you all scrubbed up and handsome. Oh, how rude of me. Perhaps you would care to join us? I'm good. Thanks. Well, it was lovely to meet you. If you change your mind, just let Jake know. Come on babe! Hi. How can I help? I'd like to book a flight to LA tonight. Of course: first class, business or coach? Coach... actually, any of them is fine. Okay. Unfortunately tonight's booked. There's only two flights a day to LA and they fill up really fast. The soonest flight out with space is... tomorrow night. Oh no, I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sure we can get you on that flight tomorrow. I'm okay, I just... really horrible day. May I suggest that you indulge in a little spa time? We have a wonderful yoga meditation class that starts in an hour. It's very relaxing for mind and body. I can reserve a space for you? And you can let me know later about the flight. If you want it, I'll take care of it for you. Okay... Thank you. And as we inhale for one, two... three and hold, we go deeper. And exhale for three, two, one, hold. Now inhale again, this time continuing at your own pace. As we disconnect from the outside world and we let all the worries of the day go. Thank you. Celebrating the miracle of life inside each one of us. Our ability to love is our greatest gift. To love is our greatest strength. Mind if I join you? Oh, hi! No, please do, I could use some company. Kirk. Lindsey. That was a such great class. Thank you. Thank you for coming. I hope the class helped. It did, actually. I got down to some deep, deep truth. Which can hurt sometimes... I just keep searching for the answers and coming up short. Sounds like a very human condition. It's a human condition alright. I'm pregnant and I'm a little nervous about it. For obvious reasons and then there's some not so obvious ones. It's just so much to take in and take on and I'm just to... I'm sorry. Look at me! We barely even know each other and I'm just blabbing away. Oh no, if you don't want to talk about it, that's fine. I just came over here because you looked like you could use a friend. Thank you. That's very kind of you, I could use a friend. Somebody you know? Oh, umm... yes it is. We were... we're co-workers. So, umm... What got you into yoga? Oh, it's a long story. That's okay, I could use a long story. Okay, when I was in college, I... All my friends were kind of doing yoga and I was pretty lost at the time, and... Is everything okay? I'm sorry. That's okay. I'm not feeling well. Okay. Thank you for the company. Excuse me. Yeah. [phone vibrating] [phone vibrating repeatedly] [phone vibrating] [front door opens] I know how this must look. I don't care how it looks. You care how it looks. And I'm leaving tomorrow so you can have it look however you want. Don't go. Please, I can explain. There's nothing to explain. I need to get away from you and from Gwen. It's not good for me, and for the baby. I need to be focusing on my health. You do, and I promise if you'll just let me explain... I have seen enough with my own eyes. You lied to me about being separated! No... that wasn't a lie, that was the truth. I'm not some homewrecker, Jake. Or a mistress, but you've made me into one. I'm so much more than that, and you took advantage of me! I've been separated for months. That is Gwen, that's how she operates. And spending the night with your wife is apparently how you operate. This, right here. This is the divorce papers, I had my attorneys draw them up. And? And they just sent them over. As soon as Gwen gets out of the spa, I'm telling her it's over. So we can start our life the way we said we would. Sure. Start it right. Lindsey! Lindsey Harris... Jake, get up. I'm going to divorce Gwen... and as soon as the divorce is final, I want to marry you. Jake... For you, and me, and the baby. Jake. I've been so humiliated, Jake. I didn't sign up for this. You didn't break up my marriage. That was already going to happen. I just happened to be so damn lucky to find the girl of my dreams. Now, here I am asking you, begging you... Will you be my wife? Take care of the divorce, and then we'll talk. Yes! I'll take that. You've made me so happy and I promise, I'm going to do everything in my power to make you even happier. You go and give her those papers, then come back to me tonight. I'll be one hour. I love you. Remember that. This is for us. Jake? Front desk. Concierge, please. One moment. Concierge, how can I help? Hi yes, are there still seats available on the flight to LA tonight? Yes, there are openings on the 9:25 flight. Great yes, I'd like to book it. Okay. Thanks. [phone dialing] Lindsey! How's it going with the mystery man? Horrible... I'm breaking up with him. I was such an idiot. Oh honey, I'm so sorry. I feel devastated, Andrea. It's like I've been toyed with and forgotten. I should never even have gotten involved with him. How can we make this better? I don't know. I guess I need to sit here and feel sorry for myself. I can't stop crying... Listen, I know exactly what you're going through. When Clay left me and the kids, I was a wreck. A complete basket case moping around the house in my sweats. But you know what? I had to change some things up, get out and distract myself. You're at a resort, right? Go get some fresh air, take in some sun. It'll be good for your soul. Trust me, I know. Maybe you're right. Yeah, I am. I mean, I did bring a bathing suit for a reason. Yeah, you did. And I don't need him to have a good time! I can figure it out. That's my girl! Call me if you need me. I will. St need a little more time! Yeah, we don't have any more time. I'm working multiple angles here. Find a better one! I'm working on it. Work harder! I confronted both of them at a cafe. Why would you do that? That's the way you scare people off. Trust me. I thought that you had tricks up your sleeve. Isn't that what I pay you for? Taking photos and confronting them at a cafe isn't a trick. I want real magic. Make make her disappear! I'm just doing my job. Really? Because I told you to scare her off, not him. Steer clear of my husband. I'll handle him. I'm gonna level with you. Oh please do, for what I'm paying you... It's time to give up. Excuse me? You've lost him, Gwen. My husband loves me. I have some information that says different. I'll believe it when I see the proof, Neil. Oh, I'm working on it. Then make sure it's something I can use to make him stay. Not just your intuition. How much cheating do I need to dig up? You know what? You're fired. Gwen, wait. I asked you to confirm my suspicions and you failed. Then I asked you to get rid of her, and as far as I can tell, she's still here! So really Neil, your services are worthless to me. She's pregnant. Jake would never do that to me! I went through her garbage. She took a pregnancy test. I'm sorry... How do I win? If you really want to keep Jake, I know some people that can get rid of her for real. Just give me the word, I'll make the call. But it's going to cost you. If that's really what you want. [Lindsey's phone beeps] Whoa, whoa! What are you doing back here? There's this man, he's chasing me. What man? This area is for employees only. Right now, I need to escort you out of here. File a report at the front desk. [phone dialing] Lindsey? Jake, I'm so scared! I don't know what to do. What's going on? Is the baby okay? That guy from the restaurant, he's at the resort. He knows Gwen! Yeah, he said that. They must have met at some point. No, they are working together. She's hired him to get rid of me. What do you mean? She wants us to break up and if I don't leave, he's threatened to kill me! Wait Lindsey, that doesn't even sound logical. Gwen would never do anything like that. Jake, you're not listening to me! I heard them talking. You obviously don't know Gwen and what she's capable of. You need to stop making excuses for her. She is willing to keep you at any cost. When you sent me that text, he heard the noise and he chased me! Jake he... He chased me and I think he was going to kill me. Okay, I want you to take a breath. And then I want you to get out of the hotel until I figure out who this guy is. You're not safe here. Where do I go? Meet me at the restaurant we had lunch at. I'll be there as soon as I can, okay? Where are you? I'm about to walk into a big meeting right now. I'll need an hour at the most. Okay... I'll meet you in an hour. Lindsey, we're going to figure this out together. We have to for the baby. Yeah. And Lindsey? Thank you for calling me. I was afraid I was never going to hear from you again. I love you. Hey! Kirk, hi! You found one of my favorite spots. I did, it's beautiful. Hey listen, sorry if I was rude last night. Oh no, don't mention it, it's fine. Sometimes I talk too much... No, it was definitely me: I was rude. I've been going through some things. Better now, I hope? I don't even know how to answer that. I'm actually meeting someone. Okay, well it was nice to see you. But I was going to say... I might be waiting awhile. If you're not busy, would you care to join me? Yeah, of course. Great. Ginger and lemongrass to calm your nerves and make it a better day. Thank you. You want to talk about what's going on? I think somebody's trying to kill me. Are you serious? I don't know... This whole trip has been a nightmare, quite frankly. With the exception of meeting you. Glad to be the one good thing. First, I fall off a cliff during a hike and I almost die. And then my boyfriend, or ex-boyfriend, or whatever he is, his wife shows up... That's never good. They were supposed to be separated and getting a divorce, but... I don't know. So last night you mentioned you were pregnant? Yeah, with his baby. That's a lot to deal with, Lindsey. I wish I could say I've got this no matter what. Even if he doesn't leave Gwen. Of course you've got this. You've got this. I just wish I could quiet the thoughts in my mind. I don't know if this will help, but two years ago, a guest came to my class, and she was carrying the weight of the world on her shoulders, just like you. And I remember thinking, you know, she's so young and so beautiful, and she has this whole world ahead of her. Then I saw her at the restaurant later, sitting alone like you. And I thought, you know, I should join her, I should talk to her, try to take some of the weight off her shoulders. But I didn't, and she killed herself. What? She jumped from the hotel balcony. No... So when I saw you sitting there, I had to talk to you. Because you were carrying so much and you're still carrying so much, Lindsey. So what I wanted to say last night is that, whatever happens, you will get through it. And you'll be okay. No matter how bad things seem, you will. And it's important to me that you know that. Okay? Okay. Gwen, answer your phone. I've got some information I left at the front desk you're going to want to see. I have an appointment with the police head of homicide. I'll fill you in more when I see you. Call me back. I hate to say it, but I have to get back to the hotel. Yeah? Yoga for Seniors? How'd you know? I saw it on the schedule. Sounds like my speed. Hey, you're welcome to join. I'd love to, but I have a plane to catch. You're leaving? I am... it's time. Do you want a ride back to the hotel? Yeah. I'm tired of waiting... [car screeching] You okay? Yeah, I'm shaking a little, but yeah. That was crazy! Am I being paranoid or are they actually tring to kill me? Lindsey, that was just some random jerk driver, okay? Remember, stay positive. Know you're going to be okay, all right? Okay. Let's get you back to the hotel. Yeah. I forgot my sunscreen, don't mind me! Gwen, I just had a very interesting meeting with the police. There's a new development that's going to surprise you and give you the proof you need. The information I left you at the front desk, now they're going to deliver it to your room because I don't know where you are. Call me when you get this. What the hell? [door knocking] Okay, Lindsey. I've gotta go prep for a class, but good luck and I hope you find everything you're looking for. Come here you! Thank you so much for everything. Stay positive. I will. Okay. All right, bye friend! Okay, bye friend. Lindsey! Hey, where were you? I was waiting for you at the restaurant. No, I was waiting at the restaurant. And then I realized that I'm not waiting anymore, Jake. k I'm heading back to LA. Lindsey! Lindsey... Hoo boy, I wouldn't make friends with that one. Lindsey? She's great. Lindsey, please! I told Gwen it's over. Yeah, she leaves today. So why don't we take these next couple days and just enjoy ourselves? It's our last chance to be happy before she's going to make our life a misery. Jake, it doesn't matter what Gwen does, or what you do. I'm going home. What about us? What about the baby? The baby doesn't come for a while. I've got some time to figure things out. Babe, just hear me out here for a second. After you told me that you were pregnant, I realized that if I left with just the clothes on my back, that's all that would matter because you'd be right there. So I told my lawyers today to file the paperwork for a divorce in court. It's over. This is the start of our new life. Right here, right now. I wish it was that simple. But right now, I need to do what's best for the baby, and that's me going home to figure things out. Is that what you really want? It's what I need. So, then... this is goodbye? At least let me take you to the airport. I'll call you when I land to let you know I got home safe. Lindsey... [clapping] Gwen. Gwen? Gwen, stop! Hey, stop! I can't wait to hear this one. It was a big mistake, she came onto me! I was flattered at first, given everything that's been going on with our relationship. But now I can't shake her. She followed me here, she even got a room next to mine. Looks to me like she just dumped you. And you seem pretty upset about it, too. You're being paranoid. I never want to hear that from you again. I know you Jake, better than you know yourself. That's the last time you're going to hear about her. Promise. This was a one time deal. A one time deal? Like that woman from a couple years ago? What was her name? Oh yeah, Shayla, right? You brought her here, to this hotel, to one of your conferences, didn't you? How do you know about that? My private detective tipped me off. But I didn't believe him. Not until now... You broke the infidelity clause in our prenuptial. And I have proof, lots of proof. You and me... we're done. Gwen, you don't mean that. You don't! [door knocking] We need to talk. I have nothing to say to you. I'm not here to hurt you. I just want to talk! There's a few things that my husband neglected to tell you about our relationship. He loves me. That's the first thing you should know. I suspected he was having some little affairs here or there, so I hired somebody to find out. Yeah, I noticed. You're not the first, Lindsey. He's been with others. I know what you're doing. You're trying to scare me off. But even if it did work, Jake will always have to deal with me. Because I'm pregnant with his child. Yes, I've heard. That's why I'm here. Do you know that Jake had an affair with another woman here in this hotel? My private investigator, Neil... is smarter than most. He did a little checking on Jake's last affair. Looking at the dates that she stayed here, comparing them with Jake's. Combing through her social media. No one knew they were together. She killed herself over Jake? Maybe she killed herself. Maybe he killed her. What proof do you have? None, but I've been with Jake a long time. I know him on a cellular level. Today, when I mentioned her name... I just knew he did it. When I hired Neil, I never thought it would be to uncover a murder. I just wanted to scare you off. I was jealous and I thought that you were replacing me. So I fought back. But... when I found out about the baby, I was ready to give up and give him the divorce. But I guess I'm a good person after all, because today when I saw those photos, I knew I had to warn you, woman to woman. Because you're pregnant and maybe... Maybe I never knew Jake the way that I thought I did. So what about you? What about me? So you and Jake just keep on going? I'm divorcing him. And I'll make sure that he gets nothing. And if you're smart, you will run for your life and make sure you give him nothing as well. Good luck. [phone dialing] [phone ringing] Lindsey! Are you back? I'm leaving for the airport soon. Did you have a good time? I need a favor, are you still at the office? Yeah, why? I need to see something with my own eyes. I need you to break into someone's computer. Lindsey, do you realize what you're asking? I could lose my job! I have two kids to support. (Elevator) Going down. Andrea, you have been such a good friend to me. You're the first person I met when I moved to town. You helped me get a job at Benson Medical. But you're the only person that I can trust right now. I need you to break into Jake's computer. Don't tell me he's the mystery man. He is... I'm embarrassed and ashamed. You know he's married, right? He's separated, or is, or was. I don't know what he is, all I know is that... He's the father of my unborn child. Oh no, Lindsey... If he's done something illegal or if he's dangerous, I need to know before he comes back. Can you do that for me? Gwen! I can explain. There's nothing to explain, get out of my way. Think about how bad this is going to look. You wanted that perfect life. You wanted everybody to think that you got it all. This doesn't quite fit your scenario, does it Gwen? What's your father going to think about his daughter's failed marriage? But you and I, we can put it back together. We can make it look perfect. Come on, you know you love me. Yeah. You're right, I do love you. Let go of my arm. Andrea... My life might be in danger, does that make a difference? You always say, we girls got to stick together. Okay, I'm here for you. Thank you. No, I'm still coming. I'll get there, I promise. Oh yeah. I want to see you too, don't worry. Yeah, I said six or so... I'll get there, don't worry. Don't forget to keep the oven warm. Okay, I'll see you soon... Lindsey, Mr. Benson's here working late. Where is he now? In his office. Perfect, now's the time. Now? [phone vibrates] Yes, now! Let me know when you're in. Okay, I'm in. What are we looking for? Get on his computer and see if he's had any communication with ShaylaCat89. Lindsey, if this is you being a jealous lover... She's dead, Andrea. And I need to know if Jake killed her. I'm about to get on an elevator, so I'm going to lose you. But please do this one thing for me. I really don't like this at all, Lindsey. But okay, here you go. Okay yes, he had communication with her quite a bit two years ago. Go to their last conversation. Tell me what they said. ShaylaCat said she's going to tell Jake's wife about everything, and she's going to tell Mr. Benson as well. What did he say back? Oh, this is rich. He says he's leaving Gwen. That he wants to make it up to ShaylaCat by taking her to the conference in the desert. That's the same place he took you. Lindsey? What did he say to her? His words: read it to me. "I love you. Tomorrow is going to be the first day of our new life together." That's exactly what he said to me. Oh Lindsey, you're not going to believe this. Guess what the last thing he searched for was? (Elevator) Going down. Has he taken you hiking? Lindsey? Lindsey! Lindsey Harris. Let's take a look at the honeymoon suite. Lindsey! [door opens] There you go. Thank you. You're saying what? If you want to fire me, I understand Mr. Benson. But I truly believe that Lindsey is in danger, and that Jake is the reason. I'm calling the police. You stay here. You're not really going to try and kill me, are you Jake? Only if you try to run. I've got a few things to explain to you, make sure you understand. Hey man, can I talk to you about something? Is it about your friend? How'd you know? Let's check it out, I've got the master key. Get up! Here's what needs to happen. First off, I need to know if you talked to Gwen. No. I'm taking the stairs. It's coming! I'll meet you up there! Are you lying to me? No, come on Jake, I would never lie to you. Because Gwen seems to think that certain things are true. And I can't be having her think those things. She left me Lindsey, because of you! Jake, calm down. If you do anything to me, you'll do it to the baby. You understand what's at stake here? If I lose Gwen, I lose everything. So I'm going to need to fix this. Put down the knife, Lindsey. Put it down! So it was all a lie? The proposal, you telling me that you loved me. I was just having fun. You fell for it. Go... just go. I'll never bother you again. I'll move away if I have to. You'll never see me again. I'm breaking up with you, Lindsey, in my own way. Like you did with Shayla? Exactly like I did with Shayla. [screaming] Lindsey! I've got the key! Lindsey! Lindsey? No! Lindsey! I don't know... It's okay. Lindsey... [excited screaming] Oh, I'm so happy you could make it! Oh my god, I can't believe how big you are. I know, right? Any day now. How are you feeling? I feel great. You have to come over and see the final touches on the nursery. It's so cute, thanks to you. There's a reason I kept all that stuff in the garage when my kids were little. There's more where it came from. Thank you Andrea, you're such a good friend. So, you got a big promotion at a new company, a baby on the way, seems like things are going really well for you. They are. I feel really positive about everything. Your friend Kirk got in touch with me. He wanted to make sure I got this to you. What? Kirk has been traveling in Europe for months. I know. He sent it to me before he left. He just wanted to make sure everything was okay with the baby before you got it. "Lindsey, may the sun rise and set over your new baby, and may it bring you peace." Beautiful. I'm going to hang this in the nursery. I want my baby to look at this every day and know that no matter what, everything's going to be okay. Aww! Everything is okay.
