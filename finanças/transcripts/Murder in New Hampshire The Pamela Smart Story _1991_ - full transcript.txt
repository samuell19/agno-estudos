Tell me what you want. - [Pete] Shut up, man, just shut up and give me your wallet. - Fine, here. Here, take it all. Where's my dog? Please don't hurt my dog. - The dog is fine. - Well then, what do you guys want? Just tell me what you want! - [Pete] The ring, gimme the ring. Give me the damn ring. - Please don't take my wedding ring. My wife will kill me. - Pete, come on. Pete. (tense music) - I can't do it. Billy. I can't. (tense music) - Oh God, forgive me. (gun firing) - There they come. (tense music) How'd it go? - We did it. I killed him. (reporters yelling loudly) - [Man] What do you mean there's no more seats in there? (reporters yelling loudly) - [Officer] Unfortunately, we have no more room. - Pamela Smart seemed to be the perfect role model for the students of New Hampshire School District 21. She was young, extremely bright, attractive, and a very hip media director. Kids looked up to her. They liked her. In fact, one young boy, Billy Flynn, developed a crush on her. Fantasy, really, like most teenage boys might. But unlike most, this fantasy was encouraged, nurtured, indeed fulfilled by Ms. Smart. The defendant initiated an affair with Billy Flynn. She freely admits to having sexual intercourse with the then 16-year-old Billy, several times, in fact, in his house, in her car, in her office at school. But it was after the very first time they had sex, in her home, in the bed that she shared with her husband, Greg, who was away on a business trip that she drove Billy back to his place and on the way, she informed him that they'd have to break up. Gregg was getting suspicious. There wasn't anything else that could be done, except murder Greg. And for the next 12 weeks, Pamela Smart relentlessly urged and systematically instructed Billy Flynn to take her husband's life. (telephone ringing) (rock music blaring in headphones) (telephone ringing) - Hello? - Can I interest you in some term life insurance, ma'am? - You got the job at Northeastern. - Dateline New Hampshire: Gregg Smart follows in footsteps of father, Bill, world to become a more secure place as of Monday. - Well, congratulations, Greg. That's good news. - Thank you, thank you, thank you. Listen, have you seen that fiance of mine lately? (rock music blaring in headphones) - Greg's on the phone. He got the job. - You really got it? - [Greg] How could they resist? So, can you pack a bag in an hour? - For what? - [Greg] Well, I figured we'd spend my last weekend of freedom having a wicked good time in Boston, huh? - What do you mean, last weekend? - Pammy, it's a figure of speech. So, what, I'll pick you up at six? - Okay. - Okay, bye. - Bye. - This is wonderful. I think, this is just what Gregg needs. - What? - I just meant, he could do with a bit of maturing. There's nothing like a real profession to do the trick. (heavy metal music blaring) (doorbell ringing) - Hi! We have a 6:30 dinner reservation. Come on, let's move we're gonna hit some Friday night traffic. - Your hair. What happened to your hair? - Well, the barber's still sweeping it up even as we speak. Sorry, babe, it had to go, you know. I'm a big time corporate exec now. - It was so long; it was so beautiful. - I know and it's all for you. - I don't want it in an envelope, Greg. I want it on your head. It's so wild you look-- - Pam, I may look like Donald Trump, but I still feel like Jon Bon Jovi. - It's not funny, Greg. - Honey, look. In a couple of months after I've knocked 'em all dead with my sales magic, I'll grow it back and nobody's gonna care. In the meantime, I gotta make an impression, right? It's just part of the game. I mean, you don't wear your spiked heels and your sequined bustier to the school district, do you? It's the same thing, right? - I guess. - Come on, Pam. It's just hair. Don't let it ruin our weekend. I'm still me. I got all kinds of fun planned. All kinds. - I better go pack my spikes and sequins.

What kind of heart does it take to conspire with her teenage lover and his friends to commit this atrocity? And what kind of soul does it take to spend the weeks afterwards, weeks when family and friends are grieving for the loss of Gregg Smart, to spend those weeks coolly covering up the fact that she was a willing accomplice in this killing. What kind of woman is Pamela Smart? She's a dangerous one. - Music? - Where'd you find room in there for clothes? - Who needs clothes? - You wanna dance? (mellow music) (people yelling excitedly) (people cheering) Yes! - Judy, I just wanna thank you for making me feel so much a part of your family. Sometimes I feel closer to you and Bill than I do to my own parents, and I just wanted you to know. - We're proud to have you as our daughter, Pam and you are part of the family, you know? Now, you go and have some fun. (gentle music) - [Pam] And there's your son bribing the natives to let us down onto the private beach. - It worked, too. - That's my boy. (people chuckling) - [Judy] You just got back and you've already got your pictures organized, remarkable. - Hey, how 'bout some champagne? - Great. - Will you look at all these gifts? My Lord, you two made out. If Bill and I had gotten this many gifts when we got married, he could have retired early. - That's right. - This toaster cost $275. Isn't it just like the most gorgeous thing you've ever seen? - For $275, it better be. - For 275, it better make the damn eggs and bacon, as well. - Didn't Bill's brother, Jeffrey, give you a toaster? - He did, but it was only like 85. No, no, no, 65 on sale, so I took it back and got a credit toward another place setting of our china. - Hey, Pam. - Do you know how much all these things cost? I mean, did you go down to the store and price everything? - 'Course, I know each and every price right down to the penny. I also made a whole computer printout, so I can tell you... Okay, for instance, the cheapest present from my side of the family was $95. - Do tell. - [Pam] But the cheapest present from your side was only $55. The average-- - Pam, cool it, will ya? Nobody cares. - Yes, they do, I think, it's important to know the value of things. The average on my side was 123 and the average on your side was 89. I think it's worth something to know these things, don't you? - Champagne? 1695. - Did Pam in any way engage in the planning of the killing of her own husband? We will prove she absolutely did not, but we will only prove that if you all keep an open mind to the facts. All the facts. The Constitution grants each citizen the right to a fair trial. You must now see to it then that it happens in Exeter County. It is in your hands, and you must listen to everything in context; context, not little bits and pieces that seem to give you a kernel of truth, but rather you must take it in the context of the person from whom it is coming. If you do that, if you give Pamela Smart a fair trial, if you do not jump to conclusions but rather let the process play out before you, then you will return with a not guilty verdict. And you might even end up a little angry, as I am, that this case was ever even brought to trial. (door banging) - Pam? What happened? - I just got told by Channel Nine that I'm not good enough to be their news person. - [Greg] Oh, god, honey, I'm sorry. You worked hard on that audition, I know you did. - Two bit small town local TV station's too stupid to know talent when they see it. Rot in that media center forever teaching 15-year-olds how to plug in a VCR. - Well, listen, do you think, I don't know, Barbara Walters hit the big time first shot out? - I want it now. I want it now. - Honey, you're 22 years-- - I know how old I am. - Honey, all I'm saying is that one audition-- - I'm sorry, I'm just... I know, I'm sorry. Aren't you gonna be late for your appointments? I'm sorry. - Yeah. Are you gonna be alright? Okay. Listen, I'm gonna be home probably around 10 o'clock. You gonna be up? - No, I have an early day at the media center. - Okay. Pammy. I don't know, for what it's worth, I'd rather hear the news from you than anybody on TV. Honest. (melancholy music) - So, maybe my friends were doing cocaine, you know, a couple, three times, maybe more. You know, said it was really great. The only problem was, later, after it wore off, everything was still there. You know, I mean, maybe everything that everybody thought was bothering them, that the coke was supposed to take care of, it just seemed to bother them worse. I just figured the best thing to do is just to, to solve your problems, and that way, there's no reason to do the coke. (melancholy music) - I think, Billy's absolutely right. You know, there's like this belief that drugs and rock music kinda go together. Forget it. I mean, nobody's more into heavy metal than me. I was the D.J. on this radio talk show at this college station in Florida, and I was known as the Maiden of Metal. And so I did all the concerts, I hung out, I got to know the groups. Well, Eddie Van Halen came on my show this one time to talk about drugs and he basically said the same things that Billy just said. So, here's the deal. I guess when the partying stops, the problems are still there, they're just staring at bloodshot eyes. - Poor, young, vulnerable Billy Flynn. How vulnerable, I ask you, how innocent? How pitiable, malleable is a person who not once, but on three separate occasions admittedly set out to kill Gregg Smart? A person who admittedly put a .38 caliber revolver to the head of another human being, a human being who begged for his life and then without so much as a thought, pulled the trigger, watched the blood splatter and then simply left his victim to die. - [Cecelia] So, what do you do at school? - What do I do as Media Director? - Well, I didn't mean anything, I just-- - No, no, no, it's a really good question. I do just about everything having to do with the media. I do the news releases. I'm in charge of getting out the District 21 newsletter. I take the pictures. I write the articles. I do the layout on the computer. - [Cecelia] Wow, that sounds like fun almost. - [Pam] Well, it is fun. Jobs can be fun, you know? - Yeah, I guess. I never um... I don't know. - What do you want to do eventually? - Well, I was thinking like, maybe, you know, to be a journalist or something. - Well, you should come to the office and hang out. Really, I can always use the help. We could work on some different stuff together, see if you like it. - That'd be great, thanks. I get out here. - Which one's your house? - It's right down there. - Okay, I can drive you. - Oh, it's okay, really.

But she wouldn't quilt. She is standing in the middle of the bathroom door. She wouldn't let me by, so I just pushed past her in the doorway. I mean, okay, maybe I used the side of my arm or something, but I barely touched her for god sake. I mean come on, dad, I know I'm blasting, but I'm not comatose. - Just go to bed.

We can use the school's equipment. All we have to do is put our minds together and go wild. - Well, Billy knows how to use a video camera. Right, Billy? - That's perfect.

I wanted to spend the rest of my life with him. - Could you speak up I couldn't hear the last part of what you said. - I said, I wanted to spend the rest of my life with him. - What was it about him you loved? - He was a very kind, gentle person.

All I want is you. - But I don't think we can do this again. - What? - Because Gregg goes away like that very, very rarely, and I'd wanna be with you all the time. - Why don't you just divorce him, Pam. Then we can be together forever. - I would in a minute, bud he'd take everything. It's all in his name, the car, the house. And he can be mean, Billy. If I left him, he'd go mad. He'd get revenge, take the dog. He might even try to hurt me. - What do you mean? - Sometimes he gets drunk, and he yells and screams and throws things. He tried to hit me once. - Pam, you gotta get yourself out of there. - I would. If I could, I would. But I can't. I feel so safe with you. Will you help me? - I'll do anything you say. - Do you know anyone who would kill someone? - What do you mean? - Greg. Do you know anyone who would kill Greg? It's the only way we can be together.

Now, this year marks the first time ever that a company rookie has won the award, and it's the first time ever that a father-son team have won together. Of course, you know who I'm talking about. Bill Smart, our favorite senior and Gregg Smart, our fabulous freshman. - [Man] Attaboy, Bill. (crowd applauding) - Pam better take you out to celebrate this. - Have you figured it out yet? - What? - How to do it? - Do what? - Make it so you and me could be together without Greg. - It's I don't understand why you can't just divorce that guy? - He would never us alone. He'd follow us around, really. I was only doing this for us, Billy. I mean, I don't know I thought you loved me. - Pam, I do love you. (Pam gasping) What happened? - What do you think happened? I told you he's mean to me, okay. - Pam, he hits you. Gregg hits you. - Between that and not being able to see you all the time, I don't think I can do this. - That bastard I'll kill him myself. - You will. - I didn't realize how bad things were for you. Pam, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. It's okay. - Don't worry I'm not gonna make you do this by yourself. I'm gonna help you work out the details. The main thing Billy is after you kill him, we can be together just you and me for good. That's all that counts. Now next Tuesday I have an AOC meeting. Gregg has one of his evening appointments until about nine o'clock. He gets home like 9:30, 10:00. Basically, you have to make it look like a burglary. You can take stuff out of the house and everything. You have to tie your hair back and wear all black that way in case anyone sees you, you can't be identified. I'll come right back here to my office, and wait for you to call and tell me what happened. Do you have a gun? - No. - Can you get one? - I don't know. - You don't know. Look are you gonna do this or not? - Pam, I'm gonna do this. Okay, I promise. - You guys. You know, how come you're talking about this stuff. You're not really serious right? - We're just tying to figure out how me and Billy can be together. That's all we're just trying to figure it out. - But you're not really gonna do it, right? I mean, kill Greg? I mean, you can't kill Greg. That would be crazy. (tense music) (heavy metal music blaring) (soft dramatic music) (telephone ringing) - Media center. - It's me. - What happened? Did you do it? - Well, not exactly. You see, I didn't find a gun. And, nobody wanted to give me their car 'cause I don't have a license. - You mean, you didn't even go out there? - Well, I was gonna. - [Pam] But what? How the hell could you do this? You promised me. - Pam, I'm sorry. - You're sorry. What was all that crap about loving me about Gregg being a bastard? Was all that just so you could get into my pants one more time? - No, Pam, I do love you. - Greg, can get nuts and slap me around all he wants. As long as little Billy gets to get it on with the teacher, right? - [Billy] No, Pam don't say that. - Well, that's it we're through. Do you understand? - Come on, Pam, I need you. (telephone ringing) - Go on in, it's okay. - Come here. Come here. It's okay. It's okay. Everything's okay, come on. I have another meeting at the end of April. I'm gonna give you another chance. - Are you nuts? You wanna kill a guy that you've never even met. - He hits her. He abuses her. - [J.R.] You see him? - She told me. - Great. - I've seen the bruises. - Come on. - As long as he's around, me and Pam can't ever be together. - You sure she really wants you to do this? - Wants me to, she's making me. Otherwise she says she's gonna break the whole thing off. I need a gun. J.R., your dad's got guns. You gonna help me or not? - Help you kill a guy? - I'll help you. My dad's got a gun. Don't even know where it is, but I do. - Get real, Raymond. Guns can be traced. - She said, "It'll be worth a thousand bucks." - She'll pay us. - Yeah. - What do you think? - I think, this is nuts. (car engine revving) (tense music) - Well, congratulations. Now that you have our approval for your media course. The full board can vote on funding next month. - I never would've gotten this far without your support. Thanks so much. - Oh, it was my pleasure. Are you going to your car? - No, I'm gonna pick up something in my office. Goodnight. - See you tomorrow. (door creaking open) - [Pam] Don't turn on the light. - Pam, this is Raymond. - Hi, Raymond. So, did you do it? - Well, Greg, was already there when we got there, so we didn't go in. - What he never gets home before 9:30, never. - We didn't get there till after. - Well, actually, we got lost. - Lost? - I'm sorry, Pam. - Well, next time. Come on, I'll drop you two off. (heavy metal music blaring) Now what the hell happened out there? - I told you, Pam, we just got lost is all. - You expect me to believe that. Lost going to my house. I guess the nights we spent there didn't mean a hell of a lot to you. You can't even remember how to get there. - No, Pam. - Either you're a coward or you never really loved me, which is it? - I do love you. - So you're a coward. - No. - Right, you never loved me, which is good, because you make me sick. Get out. - Wait, Pam. Pam, I just got lost. I promise, that's all. - Yeah, fine, sure. Look I'm gonna tell Gregg everything and just beg his forgiveness. He'll probably be horrible for a while, but eventually we'll work it out. Enough is enough. - [Billy] Please, I need you in my life, I swear. - There's one way to make that happen, and you blew it both times. - Just one more chance, Pam, please. - I don't know. - Aren't you gonna take me home? - I don't want your mother to see us. No one works on a video this late. (somber music) (tires screeching) - If I lose Pam, I swear I don't know what I'll do. I know what I'll do. I'll kill myself. If I lose Pam, I kill myself. They want a thousand each. - I can only spend a thousand total. Okay. You can get in the car now, if you want? (heavy metal music blaring) Hey, J.R., slow down. The last thing we need is a ticket. Here's directions to my house, so you don't get lost again for god sake. See, I'm giving them to Billy. Memorize them and then destroy the paper. You got it? Where's the gun? - It's right here. - Make sure you use it and not a knife. No knives. - What if-- - No ifs knives are messy. You'll get blood on the furniture and the carpet. There's all these light colors, and blood never comes out. Now, don't forget the gloves. We don't want fingerprints all over the place. I left a bunch of gold chains and stuff in the jewelry box, which you can keep. And, Billy knows where the speakers are. Make sure you put Haley in the basement, okay? The last thing I need is a traumatized dog. - You left the bolted door unlocked, right? - Right. Listen, I don't know if... I mean, like what should I do when I get home? You know, should I just like scream out right and run for the neighbors or call the police or what? - Just, you know, act natural. - They're really gonna do it this time, Bill and them. - Do what? - Kill Greg. - Uh-huh. - They have a gun. - From where? - J.R.'s father had it. Oh, god I gotta go. Stop by later. I'm working straight through to my meeting. By the time I get out, it should all be over. - [Pete] We taking Raymond? - Yeah man. I don't wanna be alone in the car all that time. Hey, Raymond. - Well, now all we gotta do is just wait till it gets dark. - Alright, well, I'm gonna go over to Papa Gino's to use the bathroom, all right. - Me too. - Same here. - Hey, anybody got any money? Might as well get a pizza as long as we're gonna be there. - Hi, Mrs. Davis. Hi, I'm Gregg Smart from Northeastern Fidelity. We talked on the phone. - Right, right. Come on in. - Thank you. - Bob, it's that guy from the insurance place. - Item seven: Cost of living increase in salary for nontenured faculty, and finally a recommendation from the Winnacunnet Board that funds be set aside for a media course to be taught in the fall semester by the current school media director, Mrs. Pamela Smart. (thunder roaring) (tense dramatic music) - Take it easy, man, we won't use the gun. It's just for back up, no problem. - I'm fine. - Let's do this. - Well, now, Greg, you made a sale. Now you can call it quits for the night and get on home. Too much works's a bad thing. - How would you know? - See what you've got to look forward to. - Well, at least your home is better protected now. I thank you both very, very much. Please if you have any questions, don't hesitate to call me I'm always available. - We'll keep it in mind. - Thank you. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. (Haley barking) - It's okay, Haley, it's okay. - Alright, then if no one else has anything further to add, may I please see a show of hands for funding Mrs. Smart's media class of Winnacunnet in September. - I can't believe this. I mean, the jewelry she left us is worth about fifty cents. What a hoax job. - Relax, Pete, let's get going, all right. (suspenseful music) Maybe, we should use these. - Maybe we should use this. (heavy metal music blaring) - Alright, Pete. I can hide behind the kitchen doorway. - I'll be behind the front door. When he comes in, I'll jump him, pull him in, and then, you know, we'll do it. - He's here. Pete! He's here! He's here! (suspenseful music) - Haley. Here boy. Haley. Haley. (gun firing) - Greg. Help! Help, please! Somebody, help! - What's happening here? Where is Gregg Smart? He's our son. - Excuse me, sir. - No, we've gotta get in there. - [Officer] Sorry, sir, no one's allowed. - We're not no one this is my son's place. Just tell me what the hell's going on here. Is my son alright? - I can't tell you anything, sir. - For god sake he's right there on the floor. Well, help him somebody. Why aren't they helping him? - He's dead. - I've got to go to him. He's my son! Let me go to him, please! Please! Please! (man mumbling softly) Oh, thank you. Pam. - Could someone call my mother, please. And would someone get the dog? Could someone go to my house and get the dog, please? (somber music) - Come on in. Sit anywhere. I called you in here because I wanted you to hear this from me before the media starts trumpeting it about. There's been a tragedy. Now I know how close you all are with Pam Smart. Well, her husband was killed last night. He was, in fact, murdered. - Oh, my god, that's awful. - Oh, man. Do they know who did it? - I haven't heard anything about that. Yet, I do think though that we should all go to the wake together and show Pam some support. (somber music) - Oh, Pam. - Thank you so much for coming. It's so thoughtful of you, really. It's so nice. - Thank you. Are you alright? - Yeah, it's just shock, you know. Hi. Thanks for coming. - [Captain] Did anybody have any kind of a grudge against your husband? - No, absolutely not. Gregg was very popular, very loved. He had a lot of wonderful friends. - Any involvement with drugs of any kind? - Never, neither he nor I believed in drugs. Do you think this is drug related because I heard that on the news. I tell you it really disturbs me because it's just false. You think this was drug related; is that it? - There is no it, Mrs. Smart, only possibilities. - You can rule out drugs. I mean, the television and the jewelry were all gone. What about burglary? - Maybe. Did you husband ever exhibit any violent behavior of any kind? - No, never. - [Detective] How about to you? - No, I said never. - Mrs. Smart, we realize that this is very difficult for you. We just have to be thorough. - Well, I agree with that, I think, you should be. - Okay, let's see you were married what, a year? - Not quite. - Happily? - Very happily, ask anyone. - Was Gregg ever abusive to you in any way? - Look, that's just not possible. Gregg was a very kind, gentle soul, especially to me. He loved me, and I loved him. The only thing I can ever think of that we fought about was what to have for dinner. - I see. - I hope that you do. - Well, that'll be all for now. We'll be in touch. Oh, please don't mention anything to the media about this case. It'll just hinder the investigation, okay. - [Reporter] This okay for you, Pam right in front of the house right here? - I think so. - In the walk way it's better than inside. - I think so, don't you? - [Reporter] Yeah, I mean, the parents are in there. It's quiet out here. You know about this stuff, right? Television, you studied communications. - [Pam] Right. - Can you move that mic up just a little bit, Jim just a little bit close to her face, you know, so we can hear what she has to say. - You're wondering about the dress, right? Gregg gave me this dress. He loved it. - Don't worry about that. You look absolutely beautiful. I mean, you're holding up remarkably well. I can't believe how well you're doing. I really don't know how you do it. - I'm really not sure myself where the strength is coming from. Should I start that part again? - I'm sorry, could you, yeah. - I'm really not sure myself where the strength is coming from. From Greg, I think. It's as if he's inside me helping me bear up and go on. - Yeah, listen this morning when you called to request this interview you said something about setting the record straight. Can you tell us what you meant by that? - Set the record straight is absolutely right. I think the media has got this all wrong. They're making it sound like my husband was killed by drug dealers. I think, this was a burglary. That's what makes it so awful. It was just a senseless thing. Thank you, very much. Bye, bye. - Thanks. - I'll see you guys back in the van. Listen, Pam, let me ask you just one more thing off the record. I'm not gonna use this. But, why did you happen to call me, I mean, out of all the people you could've called? - [Pam] Oh, your my favorite newscaster. I watch your reports all the time, and I know what goes into it, believe me. - Thank you. - Thank you. We should talk sometime also about the business. - We'll do that. - Okay. - Thanks. - There's a call on line two. I think you're gonna wanna hear. - Two. - Yep. - [Detective] Okay. - I'm sorry, go ahead, miss. You said you had some information on the Greggory Smart murder. - [Girl] Yes. - Would you identify yourself, please? - [Girl] I'd rather not, if that's okay. - That's okay. I'll take down any information that you have. - [Girl] Well, I work at Papa Gino's pizza. - Oh, the one over in Seabrook or the other one? - [Cecelia] Well, if I tell you that, then-- - Right, all right, that's okay, that's okay. So, you work at Papa Gino's. - [Girl] Yes, and there's this girl that works there Cecelia Pierce. - [Detective] Yes, we've talked to her. - [Girl] You did? - Yes, but go on. What is it that you know. - [Girl] Oh, okay. Anyway, I don't know when it was, but it was about a month before the murder, the Gregg Smart murder. She told me she knew a teacher at Winnacunnet who was paying someone to kill her husband. All the time I thought like, boy, is this crazy or what. But, now with all that's happened I thought that maybe, you know that it was true or something. - Right. - I told you I don't know. I told you. - I'm telling you we don't believe you. - Well, I guess, that's just your problem. - It could become your problem in about five minutes if we decide to go across the hall and officially charge you with harboring a criminal. - We have an informant that told us that you have information about the murder. - Who said that? - It doesn't matter who. It matters that they did. - They lied. I don't know anything. (heavy sighing) - You got an appointment or something. - I'm supposed to be at driver's ed. - Well, excuse us. I mean, please, accept our apologies. - Cecilia. We'll be talking to you again. I promise. - How did it go? What did they ask you? Did they grill you? (telephone ringing) - Hello. - [Pam] Hi, it's Pam. - Oh, hi. - I'm sorry to bother you. I was just sitting here thinking about Greg. I feel like I'm literally going out of my mind. - I know, dear. I'm in the same boat. - I can't sleep without him. I don't wanna eat anything without him. I don't know I feel sometimes like I just wanna call it quits, you know I just wanna find someway to end it all. - No, Pam, you stop that. That's no answer. - I know. By the way, have you heard anything about the investigation? I know Billy Captain Jackson are close. But, the police's just completely shutting me out. They won't tell me anything. I was just wondering. - So, then, Flynn and Randall come running across the field, falling down and everything, right. They finally get to the car and get in. I mean, Lattime and me are just like, you know, "Did you do it or what?" Pete's like, "Yeah, man, let's get out of here." Billy's just you know like, "We did it, killed the guy." So, we take off, and I start singing. ♪ Shoo fly don't bother me ♪ ♪ Shoo fly don't bother me ♪ Only just to calm them down. But they don't think it's funny, and Pete tells me to shut up. So, what can I do. You know, they looked they needed it. They were nervous freaking out, killed a guy, you know. (dog barking) - [Man] Billy Flynn up there. - Uh-uh, just J.R. and Pete. - You see Flynn you tell him he ought to bust Raymond Fowler in the mouth. - Why is that? - He's been going around telling all of Seabrook that Billy and them were the ones that killed that teacher's husband. - Come on cut the crap! Now tell me the truth. I gotta know. Did you do it? - How do you think I got these speakers? - We got $500 each Ralph. Pam told Billy she gets a $140,000 insurance. I mean, like, this guy's worth more dead than alive. - I grew up with you guys. Sorry about the time, sir. - It's just been cleaned, real recently. - I'm sorry about this. I'm real sorry. (tense dramatic music) - This is my firearm. It's registered and all. Anyway, I think, it's a weapon that was used in the Gregg Smart murder. - Good evening, our lead story tonight a major breakthrough in a case that has captivated New England, the Greggory Smart murder case. Just hours ago, three boys, all of them students at Winnacunnet High School, were arrested in Seabrook. There's also an unconfirmed report that there may soon be a fourth arrest, a young female friend of the boys who may have actually driven a car to Derry the night of May 1st, the night Gregg Smart was so brutally murdered in his home. (gentle music) - Kind of late for all, isn't it? - I believe, my daughter has some things to tell you. - Is that right? Well, come right in. - [Detective] Now you'll just ask the same kind of questions we just went over. All you do is just act natural with her the way you've always been. (soft sobbing) - All I can say is no matter what they try and make you talk about if I were you I didn't know a damn thing. - All I know is I had to come and talk to you because, I mean, I don't know what to do. I have to go and talk to the attorney general. I'm just so sick of lying, you know. - Well, that's fine all I'm saying is if you tell the truth, you're gonna be an accessory to murder. - Right. - So, that's your choice. And not only that, but what's your family gonna think. They're gonna be like, Cecilia, you know about this ahead of time. - Yeah. - Yeah. And everybody in town too. I mean, if I were you-- - Okay. - Once you say no, they leave you alone. Once you say yes, they never leave you alone. - But they're gonna subpoena me, Pam. I know they are. I hate this. What if I lie on the stand, and they find out? - How are they gonna do that? - [Cecelia] If someone says that I did know. - Who the hell is gonna say that? - I don't know, J.R. Does he know what I know? - Even if he did know, it's his word against yours. They can't prove a thing. - But what I was saying is obviously, I knew about it beforehand. If I go up there and lie and they find out about it after, I'm in big trouble. - So, that's my point. So, you're better off just lying about it to begin with. Just stick to your story that's the best way. And, of course, probably J.R. is gonna roll any day now. He was supposedly only in the car, but who knows. So, he's gonna be like, "Well, screw this. "I'm not gonna go to jail forever," and turn against them and blame me. - Right. - But, I mean, hell I never said any words like, "J.R., I'm gonna pay you to kill Greg. "I never said that." Who's a jury gonna believe, J.R., the 16-year-old kid in the slammer or me? I'm a teacher. They're gonna believe me. Oh, hi, this is a surprise. - [Captain] Oh, I'm sorry. We really couldn't call first. - It doesn't matter I'm just in a middle of a few things. - [Captain] Keeping busy, huh? - Well, yeah. You too, right? - [Captain] Always. - [Detective] Too busy. - Right. - Listen, Pam, would you mind standing up? You're under arrest. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to talk to a lawyer, have him present with you while you are being questioned. If you cannot afford to hire a lawyer, one will be appointed to represent you before any questions if you wish. (telephone ringing) - I'll get it. Hello. Oh, hi, captain, how are you? Uh-huh. What. I'm sorry. Yes. Yes, I do. Uh-huh. Thank you. - Bill. What is it? - They've arrested Pam as an accomplice to murder. - I just didn't wanna believe it. - Children are killing children, Judy. Who knows what to believe anymore. - Listen to me. They could put us away for life if we don't take this deal. This way we're looking at 30 years max with 12 off for good behavior. Eighteen! Eighteen versus life. - I told her I wasn't gonna tell on her. I promised her-- - Forget that. You think she's thinking about you now? She's going around saying it was all your idea. She had nothing to do with it. - You gotta testify against her, Bill. We gotta hang together on this one. Hasn't she ruined your life enough already? (footsteps approaching) - Well, you boys talk it over? - Yeah, we talked about it. - We'll do it. We'll testify against Pam. (somber music) - [Prosecutor] Is this the knife that Pete Randall held in front of Gregg Smart's face? - Yeah. - So, after you found you couldn't cut his throat what did you do then? - I took out the gun, and I cocked it, and I aimed it at his head. - [Prosecutor] After you aimed the gun at his head, what did you do? - I just stood there for a long time. - [Prosecutor] For how long? - It seemed like a hundred years. I whispered. God, forgive me. - And? - I pulled the trigger. - We'll take a morning recess. (people chatting loudly) (reporters muttering loudly) - No comment please. - No comment at this time. - Absolutely no comment. Sorry, coming through. - No, comment. - Has the jury reached a verdict? - We have, Your Honor. - [Judge] Will the defendant please rise? How do you find the defendant Pamela Smart on the charge of accomplice to murder in the first degree? - [Forewoman] Guilty, Your Honor? (reporters speaking loudly) - [Man] Will you be filing an appeal? (reporters speaking loudly) (somber music) - You can finally rest now, son. - Come on, sweetheart. (soft dramatic music) (Multicom Jingle)
