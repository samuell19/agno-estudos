911. What's your emergency? Please. Please send someone. Tell me what's going on, ma'am. Just send someone. Deputies are already on the way, ma'am. Are you hurt? I don't know. I-I have to get out. Ma'am, are you still there? I can't get out. He could still be here. Found her sitting in the middle of the room. Which room? The bad one. The bad one? Is she hurt? Medic says she's pretty dehydrated, but fine otherwise. It's someone else's blood. We haven't been able to ID her yet. Loewen. Sorry? Her name is Cora Loewen. Hey, Cora. You need anything? You want some water or something? Can you tell me what happened? Can you tell me whose blood is all over you? I just wanted him back. He told me we could get him back. Who told you? I really thought that we could get him back. No. Cora. It's been seven years. Wyatt. Wyatt! Wyatt. Hey! Wake up. You got to help me hide all this shit. Fuck. Are you Noah Loewen's mother? What is this? Do you know where your son is, Ms. Loewen? - Yeah, of course. - Of course I do. Okay. What the fuck is this? We're just following up on the welfare check, ma'am. Can you just go confirm that he's here, please? Center 15 send two. That's a negative at the residence. The pain of losing someone close to us can feel unbearable. Loneliness, helplessness. Just a feeling that no one else on the planet Earth could possibly understand. And yet everyone in this circle has felt that way to one degree or another at some point. And just to have the courage to sit in this room, to be here together, for this kind of healing, that is the first step toward taking back control. Just gives me this warm feeling in my heart knowing that it might give you just a tiny bit of comfort to hear it and to share it. Because having this group has given the loss of my Beverly a meaning that I just never thought would have been possible. And I owe that to everyone. All right, well, we got pivot to Thursday for next week because bingo has the room reserved. All right. Thanks for coming, you guys. Today is his birthday. Or... it would have been. It would have been his birthday. I've never really shared here. I think because I thought that just by coming, I was somehow moving forward or working towards something. Healing. Maybe. I don't know. Looking for an answer to a question, I guess. I think I might have just been kidding myself. There probably isn't an answer. But I search and I search for that thing. You know, that little thing that just might help trigger something or help me remember. But there's just nothing. There's just staying high. That is all there fucking was. And I didn't care what anybody did to me or what anybody took from me as long as I was high. And I promised myself that I would be sober when he came back to me. And I have been sober a very long time now. I mean, I don't even know how I'm supposed to act anymore. You know? Or what I'm supposed to feel. I mean, what am I supposed to do with all this? Am I supposed to hold out hope? I mean, a mother is supposed to hold out hope, right? What kind of mother would I be if I just gave up hope? But what if I just don't have any? What if this is all just bullshit? Guess it's about that time of year. - Hey, Cora. - Allison. I was in the area, so... Yeah? Well, I'm fine. You can cross this off your guilty conscience list or whatever it is you do. - I'm around, you know? - You're around? You want to go grab a beer? How are you, um... How are you doing? Existing. Today, um... Yeah. I know what today is. I see how people look at me, you know? Probably just don't even know what to say. Yeah. Well, when they do say something, I spend the whole conversation comforting them. I mean, how does that work? And then they end it with some bullshit they don't even mean. I swear to God, if I hear "We're in this together" from one more fucking person... I miss Mom. Yeah, I do, too. But that big house feels pretty quiet. Well, I actually kind of like it. Just me and my ghost. Noah loved that house. You know, she kept a room for him? - Yeah, I know. - Yeah. I sleep in there sometimes. Sorry. I forget how to talk to people. Look, um... I'm not going to pretend that I know what it's like to live your life. But, for what it's worth, it never leaves me. Not even for a second. That came pretty close to "We're in this together." Hey. You got to go. Something wrong? No, you just... You just got to go. Cora, I cannot do anything to help you unless you tell me what happened. Cora, let me help you. Okay? I really do want to help you. There was a man. What? There was a man. ♪ How could you ♪ Love me, love What can I get you? Hey. Hey. What's up? - I was just in the neighborhood. - I thought I'd grab a bite. What's... What's good? Good? Um, the burgers are safe. Meat loaf, not so much. Let's live dangerously. Meat loaf. Mm. Thank you. Mm-hmm. - You can do that? - What? Oh, well, I'm off in a few, and there ain't nobody here anyway. What are you, the waitress police? You want anything besides water? No. What? Don't be weird. It's... your button. My little girl's favorite movie. Oh. It's Noah's, too. Huh. You know, there's this theory. The entire story was in the dad's mind. Male clown fish are known to eat their eggs. - Hm. - They'll protect the nest. Make sure everyone's safe. Then turn around and just start... The theory is that the dad ate all the kids, so he never really even ever had Nemo. So he goes on this journey, just... goes off searching for him to ease his conscience. That's dark. Hey, I... I really need to thank you. - Thank me? - For sharing. I know that's no small thing, and it helps people. We're all alone until we find out that we're not. Well, that just kind of came out. I mean, I'm glad if it might have helped somebody, but my motivation was not that noble. It actually means "nobody" in Latin. So the movie is actually called "Finding Nobody"? Are you okay? Meat loaf. No! You've ruined everything. - Her clothing get processed? - Confirmed. Blood swaps? Everything's off to the lab in the a.m. What about, um, 911 calls, missing persons reports, - anything like that? - No, nothing. Who the fuck's blood is on you, Cora? An animal maybe? - What? - You saw all that creepy shit. What if it came from a, I don't know, goat or something? Field kits showed presumptive positive for human hemoglobin, Detective. Is she a hype, Sarge? In her day. Well, she's got to be using then. Maybe. Hey. Hey. Hey. You stopped coming to group. Yeah, I think... I'm really busy right now, so... Can I come in for one minute? I don't really think that that's... For a minute. We've all been a little worried. I'm fine. - How can we help? - Okay. I don't think I can do it anymore. Group. It's just... It's all getting to me a little bit too much. Is there any way I can convince you to come back? I really appreciate everything that you've done for me. I really, really do. I mean, it is far more than anybody else has bothered, but, uh, I just... I can't do this anymore. Any of it. Cora, how badly do you want to heal? How what? What kind of question is that? What if I told you... What if I told you there was a way to truly heal all of this? Thank you. But I am all tapped out on the self-help. No, no. I mean really. Heal it. Fix it. What if you could see him again? Is that supposed to be funny? I mean, what the fuck does that even mean? Exactly what I just said. Mm. Like some metaphysical bullshit? Like a like a seance or something? Something like that. Okay, um... I really do appreciate your concern, but, uh, I got things that I got to do, so... You do? What do you have to do to? I don't know. Things. Real tangible things that I can touch with my hands and I can see with my eyes. Cora, I am offering you a chance to undo this. Cora, you know what happened to me, right? You know I lost my little girl. Mm-hmm. Well, I got her back. What? She's alive. Please. Go. She's alive. I got her back. She's alive and well, I'm telling you. - Bye-bye. - She's alive. Yeah. Cora? What did he mean by that? That he got his daughter back? God damn it, Cora. You got to help me out here. Why did he say that? Because it was true. What was true? That he found his daughter somewhere? No. No. He brought her back. Back? From where? - Fuck. I don't know. - Where do you go when you die? Jesus Christ. I'm telling you, you don't know every fucking thing. Yeah, well, let me tell you what I do know. I know that that little girl is dead because I saw them pull her lifeless body out of the water. Mill County got the guy, Cora. It was some carny out of Sioux Falls. I mean, full confession, physical evidence. And did I mention a body? She is alive. They changed her last name to the ex-wife's, and they moved to some richy bitch part of Boston. Alive and well. I'm fucking telling you. Becky or Beverly or some shit. Go look it up on your back computer. Jesus. Tell me. I'd feel better if... No. Right here. When they... found... when they pulled her from the water, she was... you know... the... Fish had gotten to her. She'd been down there a while. She was still so beautiful. So beautiful. It was not long after that when, uh... a woman came to find me. She was... I still don't know. But she started to tell me these things. She told me what I'm telling you. There is a way to get them back. Back from where? Wherever it is they go. I'm going to get in your truck. But only because I'm cold. But if it gets weird... Just don't be weird. It's a ritual. - Like a seance? - No. It's like a ritual. It's old, like Mesopotamian or something. I swear on my life that I did this. I did this, and it worked. Look, you know what happened to her. Everybody around here knows. They just know. The same way they know your story. But you know she's alive, don't you? You wouldn't be here. Hello? Uh, yeah. No, I'm sorry. She's passed. Yeah. This is your daughter. No, the other one. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. All right. What the fuck am I doing? ♪ Where, oh, where could the little boy be? ♪ ♪ The monster mom needs tickles to live ♪ - Boo! - Oh! I found you, Mr. Magoo. Oh, that tickles! Yeah. She left me. I know. Yeah. A long time ago. Right when Nolan went missing. Noah. Oh, yeah. Well... yeah, right. You're served. The fuck? You stay away from her house. I'll go where the fuck I want. Yeah, well, that paper says otherwise. 100 yards. You have a nice day. Hey! Hey, how's it feel to know that you're just shitty at your job? I mean, you did... You did find his, um, his shoe, though, right? So you got that going for you. You didn't completely go home empty handed, but then you just sort of gave up. I mean, who does that? Who... who gives up on a missing kid? And may... Maybe it was just too tough. You know, tough case. Too tough for a lady cop. I'm a feminist. You know, I'm all for... I'm on your side. I want to get you up there on top and on the bottom and down on your knees, rolling around. What's up, lady cop? You forget something? Well, you got a syringe sticking out of your pocket, Wyatt. Fuck my life. What about any weapons? You got any weapons in the trailer that I need to worry about? No, no, no, no, no, no. Don't even think about it. Hey. Hey. - You stay away from Cora. - You understand me? If she's looking for an excuse. Just say it. Yeah, big sister to the rescue? Say it. Yeah. I got to stay away. - You want to pick that up? - Go ahead. I gave you permission. That paper says 100 yards. But I want you to pretend it says 100 miles. Can you say that for me? Hundred miles. Good boy. His name is Noah, piece of shit. Any electronics in the house? Uh, no. No, like Internet or anything. I mean, there's one, like, tiny spot on the upstairs near the floor that you can get cell reception. Okay, good. No, we don't want any... any interference, no distraction. This is... ...real pine soap? Mm-hmm. And the salt? - Yeah, that's kosher. - Like you told me to. - Good. No, that's good. - Table salt has iodine in it. It has to be kosher or sea salt. It's a very specific. The afterlife is finicky about its condiments. Look, I understand if you're not completely sold on all of this, but I need to know right now how committed that you are. This... this is very real, and any deviation... I didn't mean to offend you or anything. - I really didn't. - I under... - I just. I'm sorry. - This is like... It's all like, you know, I mean, come on. There's, like, a damn shackle bolted to the floor, - for Christ's sake. - Alright, we should just... We should just call this off. - What? - No, this cannot - be done half way! - No, no! I'm sorry. Sorry. I... I'm... sorry. I'm sorry, I... Listen, I agreed to this, and... and you're right. I'll do whatever it is that you tell me I need to do. And I'm sorry. Truly. This is going to be very painful. I cannot stress that enough. It is something that you have never known. Okay. We're gonna need to get you clean. - Salt bath thing. - Yeah. Hey, Cora. Yeah? I'm not coming in. Are you... Are you in the bath? I am. I forgot to tell you about the salt. So the salt creates a protective layer. But also... it also absorbs negative energy. That's great. Thank you. Okay, so once you once you soak in it, you're going to scrub with it like I showed you, and then rinse with clean water. All those impurities will go down the drain. Awesome. Okay. You got it? I got it. Thank you. I'll be downstairs. Make yourself at home. Can I ask you something? Of course. Why is there so much sadness in your eyes? - Is there? - Yeah. Yeah, there is, and I can see it, but I just, I can't figure it out. I mean, you got her back, right? You thought you lost her, but you got her back. No strings. You know I haven't seen her, right? What? Are you serious? I just have some... thing to take care of before I go. She's safe with her mother. I'll go out there and visit her as soon as I get everything squared away. Whoa, whoa, whoa. What? It's for your protection. - My protection? - What does that mean? Wait, you never told me that this fucking thing was for me. You're only going to need this for today. After this, it won't be necessary, I promise. You have to remember everything you're going through, I have done. This is... This is just how it works. You either trust me or you don't. Too tight? Um, I don't know. It's... No, it's great. Look, this part is the most physically demanding of you. Especially because you're so malnourished and probably, you know... But it was very important, critical to get all those impurities out of your system. You did exactly what you needed to do, okay? Great. Can we just, like, get the show on the road here and tell me what I have to do? - Nothing. - Don't do anything. You just stand there. Just be open. Repeat the rite exactly as I say it. And... and no sitting. Stand only. It's very important. I got it. I got it. Let's go. That's important. I get it. We come of our own accord. We come of our own accord. We seek only that which is made available to us. We seek only that which is made available to us. We reject the natural order and remove ourselves from the spiritual covering... ...of life We reject the natural order and remove ourselves from the spiritual covering of life. Can we stop? I need to stop. Abel, I want to stop. I need some water. Hey! Come on. What the fuck? This is bullshit. Nothing's happening. Abel, I'm going to take this off right fucking now. God damn it, I'm not playing! I'm going to take this off! What the fuck?! I swear to God, Abel, if you don't... Yes. Oh! Oh! - Oh, God! - Oh, holy fuck! - Are you okay? - Oh, Jesus! - Yes. - What was that?! What was that? I was floating. I was floating in the air! Oh, my God. No, no, no, no, no. I felt it. I felt it. It was like an energy in my chest. Oh, my God. This is real. I'm going to hold my baby again. I'm going to hold my baby boy again! We seek to bring the dead back to the living. We seek to bring the dead back to the living. Has he come for you? We say come. We say come. - It's fine. All right. - You're here with me. - You're safe. - No, I'm not safe. - Yes, you are. - We are not safe. - Okay, look at me. - Not safe, not safe. - Honey, just look at me. - There we go. It's okay. It was like a daylight just shut off. Like somebody flipped a switch. - Okay. - No. Okay. No, we have to go back. We have to go back. It was like we invited... There is an order, and we have to follow the order. But... But what? No. Get the fuck out of here. That's the first thing you're going to say to me? Hey, Wyatt, the restraining order is still good. I renew it every fucking year. God, Cora, come on. - Answer's still the same. - I got nothing for you, okay? I got no money, no nothing. So get the fuck off my porch. You don't even know what I was here for. All right, you know, I'm going to call the cops. Fuck. We both know your phone don't work for shit out here. Holy shit, Cora. I thought he was a church going girl. Clutched my pearls. Unless that's your daddy. - Okay, Abel, it's fine. - I got this. Huh? Oh, your daddy killed himself. Hey, man. Hey, don't I know you? No, man, I don't think you do. No, yeah. Oh, shit. My bad. You... your face was all over my TV for I don't know how long, right? - Yeah. - Yeah. Fuck it. Local celebrity pulling that girl out of the gorge. - Hey, shut up! Shut the fuck up. - You can't be here. I can be anywhere the fuck I want to be, little lady. You fucking her, Abel, huh? Yeah? Are you able, Abel? Okay. Well, she asked you to leave, so... - You know what? It's okay. - Really. He's nothing. He's just a strung out piece of shit. Pot and kettle, Cora. Pot and fucking kettle. Your, um, your new man friend, he, uh, he really know you, like, really know you? Like all those dicks you sucked for dope. - Ah! - Hey. Hey, man. Hey, man! What? What the fuck are you going to do with that? I'm going to take it upside your fucking head if I have to Hey, no. Hey. Fuck. I'm going. You know, you two deserve each other. We're fucking Parents in the World Club. - Leave! - I'm going! Man, you guys probably just, like, holding each other after doing it, and you're just like, "Oh, I'm the worst parent, no, I'm the worst parent. No, baby, you did your best." And you're like, "Well, your best ain't fucking good enough." Well, I lost my kid. My kid fell down a fucking hole in the earth. How the fuck are you going to deal with that? Well, I just gave up on my fucking kid. Yeah, that's pretty bad. "Well, you know, it's even worse. I don't even..." I'm really sorry, Abel. That is not your fault. That's really nice and all, but, uh... I shouldn't let other people pay for my shitty life choices. Are you sure you're ready to do this today? What? Wyatt fucked up everything good in my life. And he is not taking this from me, too. I can't come up with the words to explain to you how difficult today will be. We go on. We come of our own accord, and we do what we will, not what we are told. We come of our own accord, and we do what we will, not what we are told. Today... ...we ask for grief. Today we ask for grief. Grief of the highest order. Grief of the highest order. Remittance for that we wish to receive. Remittance for that which we wish to receive. Shh! The rules, child. Lest this be your last memory of him. I wasn't drugged. I saw those places. I was there. Look, I... I'm trying really hard to just sit here and listen, but it's really hard with all the shit that we've been through with your... - With my what? - Hey, with my what? With your choices, Cora. With your piss poor fucking choices. You run away from everything, you know? You sabotage whatever you can't run away from. You put every fucking chemical you can find in your body, right? You know, I never even know what's up or down with you. - Okay. - Yeah. Well, I'm sorry that I could never live up to the golden child bar that you set. - Oh, fuck. - No way. What do you want me to fucking say? And how many times do you want me to fucking say it? Why didn't you call me? Oh, so you could tell me that I was fucking crazy, that I was fucking using, or whatever the fuck you wanted to say? That shit was real. It was real. And it was the only way. You weren't going to bring him home. Christ. You got a minute? Yeah. What's up? What am I looking at? Autopsy of the Turner girl pulled from the gorge last year. Mm-hmm. Yeah, I recognize her. What's with the school print out? From Blanchard Middle School. In Boston. Taken last month. You ready? No. How are these things still here? My mom had some kind of sealer put on them, and I think they're starting to show their age. It's going to show itself today. Remember, this is a barter. Not a gift. Stay in that circle. If you forget everything else, remember that. Stay in. We're gonna be fine. We're almost there. We come of our own accord. We come of our own accord. Invitation has been extended. Invitation has been extended. Grief endured. Grief endured. We now author the symbols of your arrival. We now author the symbols of your arrival. Come. Come to us now. Come. Come to us now. From black, from black. Abel? You... This... Do you not wish to set eyes on him again? To once more savor his innocent scent? Your boy... Noah. Yes. Yes, please. I'm so sorry. I'll do anything. - I know you will, child. - I know you will. Finish what you begun. How? I'm all alone. You have all you need. Told you. Fucking goat. Come on, Jones. It's okay. It's okay. Come on. Come. I've done everything. Come. When do I see him? Come, child. To the circle. For the boy. This is it, Cora. Day of payment. Noah? Where's Noah? Soon. I'm so sorry, Abel. Plate. What is this? It's just goat. No. I want to see Noah. Plate! Fuck! Now, first is for flesh. The second, blood. The third, bone. Eat. - What? - Eat. So that Noah's flesh, blood, and bone can be made whole. Ah... I gave my payment for the gift of life. I carried the secret in exchange for my daughter. He brought back to the living. And though I did not see her again, I consider my payment just and fair. - I don't... - This is the last step, Cora. Drink so the rite is complete. When do I see him? I don't know. I know that if you drink, Noah will be alive in the flesh. That's the accord. Drink it. No! Oh, no. The woman who bestowed this gift upon me paid her price! And I paid mine! As have countless souls through millennia. You made clear this was worth the toll, so pay yours. You must carry the... Shh. You must carry the seeker to the next soul who needs it. It is the way. It's the only way! Jesus Christ. Did you groom me? - Fuck you. - In the group. In the group. Were you just looking for somebody to pass this thing on to? Were you?! You've ruined everything. I offered you rebirth. This is a divine gift. In return, you took everything from me. You robbed me of ever seeing my little baby girl again because you can't follow simple fucking instructions. You fucking deserve this now! Drink! Drink it! Fuck you. No-o-o-o-o-o! I am owed. I will take back the prize. - No. - The boy one was suffering without end. He will know nothing but pain and sorrow and despair till the end of all things. No. Please. You can't. But I can. There must be something. I must have a vessel. The payment is clear. That is the way. I can get you a vessel. I can. No games, girl. No games. I can. I can. Hey. Yeah, I know. I really need to see you tonight. No, no, no. Tonight. Can you score? Yeah. Yeah. Hey. Hurry. Sweet pea? Sweetie pie? The fuck? Ooh, peek-a-boo. I see you. Hey. I got your shit. And you still got your clothes on. Dope ain't free, Cora. What is this, girl? I gave you... This vessel is tainted. Unclean. 911. What's your emergency? Um... Let's, uh... Let's get her cleaned up. We're going to get you a shower. - And then what? - And then I'm going to bring you over to Holding until we can get all this figured out. - What's Holding? - It's quiet there. - Nobody's going to bother you. - No. No, no, no, no, no. I can't be alone. Please. You can't leave me alone. We're going to need to revisit all this after you get a little bit of rest. No. Hey. Hey. Get your fucking hands off me! What the fuck?! Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. This is not helping. You need to calm down. Can you do that? Huh? I'm going to do everything I can to figure all this out, okay? You owe me that, Allison. You know me. You know me. Not her. - Okay. She'll stay here. - Just you and me. Okay? Come on. - Thanks. - Mm-hmm. Hey. Did her urine come back yet? - Yeah, she's clean. - Nothing on board. And Wyatt? Just got off the phone with his P.O. Said he's been MIA for weeks. There's an active warrant. - Hm. - Do you think she did him? No body, no murder. But she's washing somebody's blood off her in there. No way to know till the labs come back. - You're not going to find him. - He's gone. It took him. Okay. Okay. You got to believe me. Just give me a little bit of time to figure all this out, okay? We really are in this together. - Don't leave. - Door. I won't be long. You can't leave me in this fucking place, Allison! I mean, what the fuck?! You are safe in here. Okay? This is just how it has to be. Didn't you hear a fucking word that I just said? You cannot leave me in here alone. That thing is coming from me. It's like I let it out. Allison, I fucked the whole thing up, and I let it out. I'm not going to let anything bad happen to you, I promise. Just try to get some sleep. I'll be back soon. I will. Allison! Allison, no! It wants me to carry it! Allison, please! Allison! I'm so sorry. I tried. Please don't come. Please. Please don't come. I'm so sorry. I tried. Hello? Anybody? God damn it! Can somebody help me? Hi. Hi, um... hi. I need, um... Do you happen to know if Allison is coming back soon? Do you think that I could get your help? You hurt? - No. - Need the restroom? I think that there might be something in here with me. And I need your help. Please. No, please don't go! No, please! I need your help! Please don't leave me! I need your help! Go, child. Sit. Let us reason. Please! You hold the blood so that I may be made of flesh. You endured grief. Sweet, sweet grief. Lest we forget, pain. Let not regret also take residence within you. Does not a boy need its mother? We've come to the end, child. No sanctuary to be had. Payment is all that remains. Take me in. Deliver me to a broken soul. The boy... ...calls to you. Found you, Mr. Magoo. Boo!
