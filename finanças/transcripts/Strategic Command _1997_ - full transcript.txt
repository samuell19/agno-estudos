Harding. Ten minutes. Yeah, I know. I'm looking over the results right now. Just gonna have to keep trying. Okay. Sounds good. Good night. Man, this is Station 13. Third floor is clear. What do we got on the fourth floor? One minute. Thirty seconds. Oh, shit! Seal it! Come on! What's going on? Sir, we show a chemical alarm in holding cell B. Then activate venting measures now. Shit. I need backup at chemical safe B. Chemical safe baker. ASAP. Let's go. Let's go. Man down. Come on! Come on! Move! Move! Move! Move! Move! Move! -John, how many? -There's six of them. -Don't let them get away with those cases. -Yes, sir. Come on, move. Romex what? Three sixty five. It's an acidic liquid gel base non conductive. But if it's mixed with the correct explosives, it becomes gaseous and highly lethal. -You mean, like, white peat. -Worse. Imagine sulfuric acid completely burning your skin. And then just for kicks, it enters your respiratory system... ...and eats you from the inside out in a matter of seconds. Jesus Christ. Why the hell didn't anyone tell me about this stuff? Because, Rowan, -I was told to keep it under wraps. -From me? Still no word from Washington, sir. What about Colonel Stevens? Stevens and his wife were found dead in their home. Those bastards cut out the Colonel's eyes for the retinal scanner. Jesus Christ. Any usable prints? No, nothing the place is clean. Well, check out our stiffs too. Find out what the hell we're dealing with here. Yes, sir. Jesus. You know you look like... Why don't you go on home. But if I hear anything at all, I'm gonna have to call you, so be prepared. Thanks, Rowan. -Say hello to Michele. -Will do. You don't have to give up, I'm just saying you can't save everyone. Honey, I know that. Why don't we just move to Alaska. That's a good place to raise kids. We talked about this once before. And you know as well as I do... that we hardly have enough time for ourselves, let alone having kids. -Huh? -I know but... Someday, you and me will have a family. -Just not now. -Right. Just not right now. Hey. -I love you. -I love you too. Then prove it. My team recovered Bromex from Hussein's labs... ...once before the war even began. Lucky for us they didn't even know what it was. So a full scale invasion was a perfect cover... -...for further investigations? -Correct. Did you lose any of your team members? Yeah, six died from the Bromex before we knew what it was... ...and I was chosen to head up the reconnaissance missions... ...because of my direct experience. Dr Harding, your wife is here. Oh, go ahead we can wait for you. -This is some pretty serious shit. -You don't know the half of it. Rick led four covert operations into various Iraqi labs... ...and almost single-handledly destroyed all evidence that this stuff even existed. Excuse me. Excuse me. Honey, you all right? Yeah, just there's something I wanted to tell you. Well, honey, can't it wait? I'm right in the middle of something right now. Okay. Well, couldn't we take a quick walk. Honey, I'll walk with you all, all you want tonight, -but right now... -Rick... Rick. We got a lead on your Bromex. Let's go. -Where? -Pier 27. Come on. Honey, you know what, never mind. I'm interviewing the vice president on a flight to Washington tonight. -I'll call you later. -All right. -Okay. -Bye. -I love you. -I love you too. Go. It's okay. Okay. What about this lead we're following? Two weeks ago the DEA busted this guy in Long Beach. Cocaine. So he made a deal. But we don't know if the shipment's Bromex, right? Exactly. This is unit two. We're moving into position. Shit! Peds! Shit, get out of here. Get down! Get down! Johnny! Shit! Rowan, cover me! Get out here and give me a hand! Man down! Where have you been? You were supposed to meet me a half an hour ago. -No, wait, wait, wait, where's Martinez? -.He's not here? Oh, frigging great. I am the goddamn network representative, the most important interview of my life and we don't have a cameraman? -Did you call the station? -Relax, Hertzberg, he will be here. -I trust him. -Yeah, well, if I don't have a camera here very soon, someone is going to lose their job. Why don't you go into the bathroom and fix your hair... ...or your makeup, or whatever it is you do. Why, what's the matter? Don't I look good? Oh, shit. Oh, there he is. Mr Vice President. There he is! Mr Vice President! Mr Vice President, do you think that your recent visit to Shanghai... ...will open the door to more trade with China? Well, you can be sure when we arrive back in Washington, it is something we will be discussing with the President. How do you feel it will affect the current relationship with Japan? Ah, well, let me just say that... ...when Prime Minister Nakajima's in Washington next week, we'll be certainly discussing that as well... ...and I think we'll arrive at an amicable understanding... ...so that all countries will be benefited. We really need to start boarding, sir, if we're going to make that briefing. I'm sorry, as you can see I have just been told it is time to go. Thank you all very much. Ms Harding. Stephen Finch your new cameraman. What happened to Martinez? Had a family emergency so the station sent me. I'm new. Well, okay. -Let's go. -Oh, thank Christ. Ms Harding is your crew set? Yeah, we had to replace our cameraman unexpectedly. -I hope that won't be a problem. -Uh, no problem at all. I'll just have to take a look at his camera before he boards. Sure. I trust the rest of my equipment made it on board? -Drop it! -Come on, man. Now where's the Bromex? I'm sorry sir. It was all that was available on such short notice. Just more tax payer's money down the drain. When are we meeting with the President? We meet him for dinner... ...and you have the press conference tomorrow at 6:30. -We're having dinner with him tonight? -Yes, sir. -What time is that? -Eight o'clock sharp. This is Phil Hertzberg with Vice President Charles Baker. This is a conversation with Phil and Chuck. Hey, Michele, how's my hair? -You're looking good Phil. -You better believe it. This is a conversation with Phil and Chuck. I'll be right back. Oh, Hey, Bob Goulet, don't screw up. This is Phil Herzberg with my good buddy, Chuck Baker. Oh, no, no, no, Michele. Look, I can't ask him that. Come on. You're a producer. Produce something more complimentary. Phil, this isn't a popularity contest. Just ask the question. It's a bit cruel... Ms Harding, you can set up your crew in about 10 minutes. -That's fine. Thank you. -It's Emmy time. LAX confirms departure five minutes ago form LA international. Damn. Any contact with 232? Negative. All radio transmissions are being jammed to and from the plane. -We are not able to contact them. -Great. We've have just received word from LAX security... ...they've just discovered a body in hanger fifty three. All right. We're on our way. Well done, Mr Haines. Your country will be proud. Welcome aboard. He's right over there, sir. Oh, Jesus Christ. We better notify Colpart. -You've done well. -You expected otherwise? Brier. -You're all set to go, sir. -Oh, good. -Hi. -Good morning. Good morning, I'm Michele Harding. -How do you do. -Fine, thank you. Our cameraman will be in in a minute, but, first, if it is all right with you... ...we'd like to go over the salient points of the interview. Of course. Please won't you sit down. Hello sir I'm Phil Hertzberg. -I... You've got my vote. -That's good to know. How about a picture. How about a picture. Here we go. Say cheese. -Ah, please sit down. -Yeah, please. -I'll send you a copy. -Good. Amy. -I'll sit here. This'll be better. -Yes, of course. Gruber. This package is in place. Ze weapon is armed. Very good. Move into position. -Brier in position and standing by. -Copy. Hold your position and wait for my signal. My Washington sources tell me, no, my sources tell me, my inside sources tell me... -You know this camera guy... -Yes, I know I'll go see. Okay, good. Finch, are you all right? Not a sound. Now. Sit down! Sit down! Put the goddamn guns down! Wise choice, Mr Baker. -Brier. -Autopilot is activated. -The plane is now your, sir. -Well done. Set new headings back to Los Angeles air space. Dino, deactivate the scrambler. It's time to talk. It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance. What you have done over in Asia is impressive. Who are you and what do you want? Who I am is none of your business. And what I want right now is to make a phone call. So where do we stand at the moment? All radio transmissions are still being jammed to and from 232. Well, there were three large crates that were shipped... ...and loaded on the 232 from a Brandeis Avionics, but our tracers have come up with no such order. My guess is there's a bad apple in the secret service. What the hell is this Bromex 365? Bromex is concentrated in small gelatin packs. And potentially, potentially, the most destructive element ever created. Christ. -Is there any kind of antidote? -Yes, sir. A thousand milligrams of adrenalin to the back of the neck. Victims only have 15 seconds to administer this shot. You ready to sound all scared and distressed? I'm sure you're aware of the United States policy... ...in dealing with terrorists. Oh, very. Mira. Get back in your seat. Now! Please don't make this any more stressful than this needs to be. Yeah, Martin here. Rowan, there's something I've gotta tell you. About what? -We're getting a transmission from 232. -Put it through. This is FBI director Colpart. To whom am I speaking? My name is Carlos Gruber and I have seized control of flight 232. Please say hello to one of our distinguished passengers. This is vice president Baker. Yes, this is Vice President Baker. Yes, our flight has been hijacked. Our demands are simple. Paul Azrak has been held against his will for five years by your government. You will take him to LA international airport... ...where we will pick him up and return him to his home country. For his pain and wrongful persecution, you will transfer 100 million dollars through a network of accounts... ...that I will designate later. We are heading back to Los Angeles now. I have loaded Bromex 365 and C4 onto this plane. If you do not comply with my demands, I will detonate this plane over the city. I'm sure you know what the effects of that would be. You have four hours to release Azrat... ...and an additional half hour to transfer the money. Who is Carlos Gruber? Carlos Gruber has been on the UN's most wanted list for 10 years. Supposedly, he's handled over 20 acts of terrorism in 10 different countries. What do you mean supposedly? Well, normally, he's a ghost. He has no political allegiances and he never takes credit for his work. He didn't seem too shy about taking credit for this. That's exactly what scares me. Who is this Azrat? Paul Azrak was put away... ...on charges of chemical weapons misconduct by the UN... ...just before the gulf war started. And we just happen to be the host country for this guy. Agent Harding, in your opinion, what would the effect be of that plane exploding over Los Angeles. Well sir. A hundred and twenty gels were stolen last night. If properly used, that amount of Bromex... ...could wipe out every living organism within a two hundred mile radius. I'll brief the president. In the mean time, I want a full security black out. Rowan, assemble your best anti-terrorist unit. And get me the probability of success for a plane to plane transfer. I've got just the team for it, sir. Scramble a squadron of F-16's out of Edwards. Let's send these assholes a message. We are entering Los Angeles airspace now, sir. Very good. Set up a holding pattern. Twenty eight thousand feet. Twenty eight thousand feet. Copy. I don't like having all these hostages. It's too risky. Can I get rid of some? Patience. In time. Rowan you gotta let me be a part of that team. I know more about Bromex than any of those guys. -Oh, I don't know. -What, you don't think I can hold my own? Hey, no one says you're not qualified. If anything you're overqualified. But it's not my call. Things are different now. Well, you just better make it your call. -Michele's on that plane. -What? She's part of the press team that went to Washington... ...with the Vice President. Oh, Jesus Christ. A personal involvement is the worst thing that can happen... ...to the success of a mission. Now don't you think I know that. You gotta get me on that plane, Rowan. You gotta. ETA target intercepted 35 minutes. Red Squad, we're tightening up formation. Switch ITF transpotter to 5-8-5-4. Full standard formation and wait for my signal upon target acquisition. Roger that. I don't believe you. What? I always floss under pressure. Of course, this had to happen on my interview. Now all I'll be remembered for is my horrific death... ...at the hands of terrorists. And what do you want to bet he's not really a cameraman. What are you doing? I need that. -Hey, pretty boy. -Me? You're the only pretty boy here. -Shut your mouth. -That's a good idea. Colpart, I know you've been here before... ...and I think we're gonna have to go with your plan... ...even if it is highly unorthodox. Well, as you know, our options are extremely limited... so we're going to have to exhaust every possibility. And I do not want to be forced to submit. Very well, Mr President. We will proceed as explained. All right, gentlemen, good luck and godspeed. The president has given "Operation Intercept" the go. Our options are extremely limited... ...so we're going to have to exhaust every one of them... ...before we're forced to submit. We have just over three and a half hours. Our primary objective is to eliminate the Bromex threat. Then we have room to negotiate. A special forces team including our chemical weapons man, Rick Harding, is assembling and preparing to scramble. A newly modified SR-71 transporter will fly them in undetected. Once on board, they will have approximately two hours... ...to defuse the bomb and neutralize the situation. Ernie. -Hi. Dr Rick Harding. -Yeah, we know who you are. I'm Captain Ratner. And this is Lieutenant Wells. Nice to meet you. -Be a pleasure working for you. -I wish I could say the same. -Is there a problem? -Yeah, there is. You got no business being on this mission. What makes you so sure of that? Ernie, what elementary school did I go to. St Agnes of the Cross. First grade teacher Sister Maryann Margaret. Favorite color is blue. And he likes his cereal without the milk. Take a look at us, Dr Harding. We're a team. We were trained to work together. To know everything there is to know about one another. So when it comes down to it, there'll be no guessing. Just instincts. Now you're thrown into the mix and I don't know shit about you... ...except that I'm responsible to make sure... ...that you don't fuck this mission up. Maybe I can't do nothing about you being here... ...but don't expect me to pretend like I'm happy about it. Look, Ratner... Yeah, this is Abel. We are ready to receive. Radar contact closing at angle 235. Two minutes to intercept. Switching to SST Track load. Initial contact. Red code approach pattern delta. -Red three and four moving to position. -Roger that. We've got company. F16's. Standard formation. They're late, but that's all right. Patch me through. Roger switching to COM one. One one eight point five. -Hence, switch to 128.3. -Roger that. Two thirty two, land your plane at once. By order of the United States... They're ordering us to land, sir. We'll land soon enough. Pick one. -Come on, sweetie. -Wait a minute. -Wait a minute. -No. Take me for God sake. Very heroic, Mr Vice President, but I need you. Listen up. Once we're in position Ernie's gonna neutralize the bomb. We're gonna smoke them and take them out one by one. Arty questions? Two three two incoming transmission. Transmission coming in on 232. Mr Colpart. I notice you have sent us a little party. You Americans have much to learn. This is not the way to handle terrorist activity. Amy? You are going to tell them all to go away or I am going to start killing passengers. Do it. Do it. They are going to start killing people if you don't pull back the fighters. Hold their positions. Don't go anywhere. Not just yet. Red three, four, let's turn off the heat. -Roger one, let's do it. -I'm on it. I repeat our captors will start killing people... ...if you don't pull back the fighters. Christ, what are they doing? Why haven't they called them off? They're calling his bluff. They're not responding. No. Okay. Let's see if they respond to this. Puck, yeah. Hello. Anybody there? You need a new press secretary? Tell them to get out of here or you'll be next. Call them off for God sakes. Do as they say, please. Michele? Yeah, my wife. -Call them off please. -Damn it. Disengage the fighters. Red Leader to Red Group. Break off, I repeat, break off. Roger. Breaking off. They are pulling back. They're pulling back. They're pulling back. Wise decision. Please don't make me do that again. You're time is running out. No one told me your wife was gonna be on that plane. That's because no one needed to know. I don't like it. I don't like it all. I knew you would screw up this operation some how. Look, Ratner, you may not like me, but don't think for one second that I am not prepared to do my job. I was commanding missions while you were learning your ABC's. So why don't you just shut up and start acting like a leader. -Fifty four ten. -Fifty four ten. -How long to intercept? -Five minutes. Gruber, can I get someone up here for a dead pilot removal please. -Dina. -Yeah. Hey, we're gonna make a move. -I don't think that's a good idea. -We have to. These people aren't gonna let us go. We have to move now while we can. It's gonna be fine. Trust me. Hey! Hold it! Do something. Put the gun down! You sick bastards. Put him on the ground now. Drop the gun, Lisa. Jesus, Jack, what in God's name are you doing? You'd never understand, sir. -Put the gun down, Lisa. -I won't do it, Haines. -Drop it, Lisa. -No! -Drop the god damn gun, Lisa. -No, I won't do it. Lisa put the gun down or I'm gonna have to shoot you. Put it down. Put it down. Thank you very much, Mr Haines. Mira. Kill this woman. No, Gruber! No more killing! You're in no position to demand anything, Mr Haines. Are we clear? Clean up this mess. Two thousand milligrams of adrenalin. You're crazy if you think I gonna stick myself with that thing. This is nothing compared to what Bromex will do to you. All right, listen, gear up. I want this thing smooth and by the numbers. I'll go first. Remove the forward hatch and secure the bay. Nixon, you got the rear. Hold tight. It'll smooth out when we get into the slip. A little closer. Hold it. Fifteen feet. What was that? Brier, is everything all right? Everything looks okay here, sir. Voila. Locked down and pressurized. Time to go to work. Let's go. Let's go. We got 22 seconds. Hustle. Hustle. Transfer not complete. We need another 30 seconds! Let's go. Move it! Move it! Brier, what the hell is going on? I got a cargo warning light, sir. Indicating a pressure leak. Switching to manual control. Cargo hold. Mira, check it out. It's cracking. She's breaking loose. She's breaking loose. Close the hatch. Close the hatch. Damn it! Cargo hold has stabilized. You got an hour and 43 minutes. I think we should get going. I think we should move. They've gotta know we're on board. Let's go. Ernie, how you doing? Right up to Control. Only three men made it on board 232, transport arms has damage and was forced to disengage early. Ratner, Wells and Harding are the only three members to make it. -Over. -Roger. Return to base. Jesus Christ. Only three on board. It's getting worse and worse. We have to give them a chance, sir. -Everything normal on cargo. -Come on back. Leave it. Leave it. Leave it. Excuse me. He needs some water. -May I please get him some water. -Go ahead. Why don't you get us all something while you're at it. A cola. I like your American cola. Oh, shit. Looks like it's patched through the plane's wiring harness. It's drawing power from the plane itself. I'm telling you. These guys aren't playing around. What about that crap. Looks fine. No sign of degeneration. Ernie, how long? I don't know. Give me 10 minutes to figure out what I'm dealing with. You got five. Harding, you're with me. Let's set up a surveillance. Regardless of what he says, you just take your time. Excuse me sir, Mr Gruber. I've been waiting for the appropriate moment to apologize... ...for that very unfortunate poking incident. -Is there a point to this? -Yes. Yes. Yes. There is a point. You see the media can be your best friend, if you let it. You see now we all have to be concerned with our public image, right? You know reporters are the only people I know... ...who gain fame and fortune off the deeds and misfortunes of others. Or are you working that angle for personal greatness. Right. I despise you and your profession. I couldn't agree with you more. Shut your mouth. You are unbelievable. I know you're busy. I'll just... You're a very pretty woman. I could have you spared, you know. Could you get me another can? Please. Thanks. Interested? I might be. Bingo. Got two, three, no, four guys with guns. Four prisoners. Probably two in the cockpit. Doesn't look like it's gonna be easy. Is it ever? Phil? Michele. This isn't diet. I really prefer diet. That's all that's left. You're kidding. What kind of plane is this? Just drink it. Why don't we switch? -We can't. -And why is that? Cause yours has caffeine and Phil is caffeine sensitive. Aren't you, Phil? Yes, yes, it makes me edgy. I think he'll survive. Fine. Suit yourself. Bottoms up. Don't drink that. Shit. Fuck. We gotta do something. We gotta do something. What's your plan? What's your plan? Hell, there is no plan. Half my team, my equipment never made it on board. We're on our own, man. Okay, fine. Phase two. Phase two. -You don't got a phase two? -I don't have a phase two. Ratner, we got a problem. I think you better get back here. Now. We're on our way. Any word from our team? Damn. It's possible they might not be alive or already captured. We have to wait just a little longer, sir. I'll give them 20 more minutes. This thing is rigged to a remote detonator. Probably controlled by our friend, Gruber. He can blow this at any time. Gotta get that controller, man. Can you defuse it. Well, you see these? Those are electronic sensors. If disturbed, they send a signal to the remote detonator... ...that the device is being tampered with. These guys didn't miss a beat. I can diffuse it, but it's going to take some time. Well, we got exactly one hour and three minutes... ...so you better start working on it. In the meantime, we gotta get some way to signal command. Wait a minute. Is there any way you can tap into the plane itself? Yeah. Well, then we're just gonna have to give your boys... ...a little more time up there then. We'll create the illusion that we're going to free Azrak. Maybe you can bait Gruber along and let him talk to Azrak on the phone... -...before the deadline. -Very well, sir. All right do whatever you have to do, but keep me posted. Take him to the airport. Shit. -Take Haines below and check our cargo. -I don't trust him, Gruber. I think they might fold. If he gives you any trouble, waste him. Mr Brier. Take altitude down. Eighteen thousand. Roger. Descending to 18,000 feet. Should be able to splice through it here and create some kind of transmitter. If we patch it in here, it'll only send our feed right through to the cockpit. Well, then, where would you patch in? Close it up. Ernie, we got company. Copy that. Haines. Hold on a second. Hold it. Hold it. I'm Secret Service. -Yeah, and I'm the tooth fairy. -Check my ID. Check it. Hell anyone can make one of those. If you're such a good guy... ...then what are you doing chumming it up with the bad guys. They're holding my family hostage. If I don't cooperate, they'll kill them. -Well, that's too fucking bad. -It's the truth. Hold it. I believe him. -Well, I don't. -Well, I do. -This guy's a fucking traitor. -Ratner. Tell me everything you know about the terrorists. This is Colpart. Who am I speaking to? -Commander Ratner, sir. Over. -What's the situation. Five terrorists, three hostages have already been killed. And four remaining including the Vice President. All pilots have been killed. They control the plane. Over. But what's the status of the Bromex? Agent Wells is on it, sir. Says he can dismantle the bomb. We need more time, sir. Mr Gruber. -I want to talk to you for a minute. -You can talk all you want. If you land this plane and let everyone go, I'll negotiate for you directly with the president. And here I thought the US never negotiated with terrorists. Or is this a new campaign platform? You have no need to hold anyone but me. Don't confuse courage with arrogance. You might get hurt. -Gruber, everything is secure. -Very good. It's almost time. -Mr Gruber... -Sit down, Mr Baker. I'll let you know if we need you. What now. What's the count? Forty six minutes. Well, at that rate, we'll never dismantle this thing. -I'm working as fast as I can. -Well, that ain't good enough! Ease off. You know I think it's time to see if you're as really as bad... ...as you think you are. Just keep doing what you're doing. Transmission is ready, sir. Mr Colpart, according to my watch, we are due to speak with my recently pardoned friend. He's at the airport now. We'll patch him through. I must admit, Agent Colpart, I'm pleasantly surprised at the swiftness of your actions. I only hope for the sake of the passengers that the transfers will not be delayed. Well, coming up with a hundred million dollars, that's not something that can be done with a phonecall. We need more time. You have the time I gave you, no more, no less. Sir, the President. This is Rowan, put him on. Go to the bathroom. -Ernie, how you doing? -Slowly. If I didn't have all these Bromex, I could move a lot faster. Get on it. Hello. Yeah, I understand. Won't the fallout form the explosion have the same effect? Our sources tell us that if the plane is destroyed... ...at an altitude of about 10,000 feet, we can safely assume Los Angeles would be spared. We'll have to wait until the last moment, but we have to be ready. It's your call, sir. You keep your boys up there as long as you can... ...but if that plane falls below 10,000 feet, I think we both know what has to happen. -Just keep me apprised. -Yes, sir. Scramble a squadron out of Nellis. Fully loaded. -Where's Vlos? -In the toilet. Vlos. Vlos, are you there? Go check on him. What's going on? One of them is missing. Vlos. Vlos. Sheiss. Mira. Vlos ist tot. -Carlos. Vlos is dead. -I'll be right there. They're onto us. It's time to get the controller and take this plane. His neck has been broken. -Dino, grab the reporter. -Du. Actually I'm very comfortable where I am. And if you don't mind I'd like to stay where I am. But I'll go with you, I'll go with you. -Let him go. -Press credentials... Attention all passengers. This is a message to our uninvited guests who have rudely eliminated one of my men. I feel at this time we should meet face to face. So if you would so kind as to join me... ...and the rest of the passengers in the upper passenger area, I would appreciate it. If you to show yourselves by the time I count to 10, Mira here will kill this man. -Ratner. Are you in position? -Right above you. Okay. Mira's 14 feet forward, four feet to your right. Got it. I'll take Phil here and slit his throat from ear to ear. Please. Please. Just do as he says. Do as he says. I don't want to die. Please. You in position? I'm ready. One... Time to go to work. See if you can keep up. Two. Make it happen down there. We're going in. -Three. -I am doing the best I can. Four. -Harding, on your mark. -Copy. Five. Six. Seven. Eight. Nine. Ten. Sorry, Phil. -Stop! -Now. We got a severe pressure leak in the main cabin. We've gotta get the plane below 10,000 feet to re stabilize. We have radar contact Bering 240 and 334... ...closing 100 miles. ETA in three minutes. -What's their altitude? -Eighteen thousand and falling. Hold it. Stay here. Get her out of the door. Hold on. Rick. Oh, God. Hold onto the chair. -We're moving to the chair. -Okay. Now. Seat belt! Now! Get him down! Rick. Red Two, switch transpotter to 137.61. Red Leader to Control, target is lowering altitude 11,500 and falling. No. We can't allow that plane to drop below 10,000 feet. Ratner, what the hell is going on? Ernie. Where the hell have you guys been. What's going on up there? I'm hit. We messed up most of them. Couldn't stop Gruber. He's gonna blow it. Do something. When this is over, I want a big frigging raise. Just cut a wire. It's over, Gruber. Oh, you're right about that. It is over. Go ahead. Push the button. That things useless. I think I'll call your bluff on that one. Call it. Bomb deactivated. Switching the missiles! Weapons are hot! Target is continuing its descend 10,800 and falling. -Ratner. Ratner, are you there? -Harding. Pilot's dead. You know anything about flying a plane. Pull back the stick. Level out the plane. There's other planes out there. -What do they look like? -F-16s. I hate to be the one to tell you this, but I don't think they're here to save us. It won't level out. Flight 232, you're aborting the level of 10,000 feet... ...by order of the United States Air Force, do you read? Give them a warning shot. Roger, control doing the guns. I'll lay a pattern right across bound. Shit. They're firing at us. They think the terrorists are still flying. Rick, there's a comm panel underneath the altimeter. Switch it to 133.20. And tell those F16's to fuck off. -One three three what? -133.20. Going to 10,100. Switching to missiles. I got TOW. Locked on! Hold your fire. Hold your fire. This is FBI Agent Rick Harding on flight 232. I repeat 232. Do not fire. Over. Roger that 232. You got control of the aircraft? Over. Yes, we have control of the plane. Situation is under control. All terrorists are dead. Over. Roger that, 232. Over. Disengage the fighters. Evacuate the surrounding areas of LAX. Tell them to keep the runway clear until that plane comes to a full stop. Red Leader to Red Group, disengage target. Repeat, disengage target. -Form up and turn left heading 187. -Roger. 187. -Do you have a visual of the runway? -Yes. Rick, you gotta pull back the accelerator, switch the flaps to the number two position. Right. Flaps. Ratner, where's the flaps. Above you. Panel four. -Four of them? -That's it. Advance to number two position. What's your altitude? Altitude is eight hundred feet and we're moving too fast. We're moving too fast. Tell everyone to brace for landing. Everyone down! How do I stop it? Reverse thrusters. Put the breaks on. Tower confirms. They made it. -You're all right? -Sure. Not a bad day's work. Pleasure flying with you. -Are you two okay? -We're fine. Good. -Rowan. -Yeah. -Thanks. -Thank you. Well, actually, there was no time for fear. The lives of the other terrified passengers were all at stake... ...and not to mention the Vice President of the United States. In fact in one particularly harrowing moment, Charlie looked at me... I'm sorry, the vice president, looked at me... ...in apparent awe of my actions and he was shaking his head... ...and he said, and I quote, "You are unbelievable." End quote. Agent Harding. Vice President Baker. Mr Vice President. I want to take this moment to personally thank you. Your country is very, very grateful to you... ...and acknowledge you are truly fine Americans. Thank you, Mr Vice President. You're wife did a great job as well. Thank you. All the best. -We are going to Alaska. -Okay. You came by the office... ...and you had something to tell me and I was too busy. What was it? I'm pregnant. You're pregnant? Is it okay? Oh, honey, of course, it's okay. Of course it's okay. We're gonna have a baby.
