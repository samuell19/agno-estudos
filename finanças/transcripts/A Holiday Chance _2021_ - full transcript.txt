Even before all of our success, we've always made it a point to come together. But If the phrase, "a picture says a thousand words" was ever true, this one would make an epic novel. Standing there on the left is my dad Garvin Chance, to the right is my beautiful mother Sheryl. Next to her is my super annoying older sister, Naomi, who does the absolute most, absolutely all the time. [camera clicks] My parents met in high school and were inseparable ever since. Not too long after their wedding came my older sister, Naomi. And four years later to her disappointment, along came me, on Christmas Day. [giggling] Hence my name, Noel Right away, I dove head first into my books with dreams of being the first female president of the United States or something worth of living for. [audience applauding] On the other hand, Naomi dove right into the world of show stopping. Whatever that is. [audience applauding] [soft music] [camera clicks] Contrary to popular belief, I absolutely hate that my birthday is on Christmas. Everyone is already too preoccupied to remember it. Except for my Dad. [camera clicks] My sister and I had the best childhood that any kid could ask for. But for whatever reason, never could quite get along. No matter the number of battles me and my sister had, we were always a tight knit family. [camera clicks] And when my dad quit his job and started his production company with their life savings we were all there, every step of the way. [camera clicks] Over time my dreams of becoming president of the United States eventually turned into me wanting to be one thing... An entertainment mogul, just like my daddy had become. [group applauding] And Naomi, well, what can I say? Not much has changed. [audience applauding] Now, we never really seen many bad times, but this holiday season would test everyone and everything. But I'll start from the beginning to give you a better idea of this dynamic known as the Chance family. [camera clicks] What the hell are you talking about, man? That's impossible. [soft music] Man, I have made tens of millions of dollars. My company is worth 150 million. You're my accountant. How could you let this happen? Look, we have to fix this, man! There's no way that... [sighs] Fine. [sighs] Merry Christmas to you too. [sighs] Is everything okay? Why you in here yelling on the phone? Baby, hold that thought. What's today? You know what today is, Daddy. [Garvin laughing] ♪ Happy birthday, baby girl ♪ Happy birthday, baby girl You know, I know. I got a little something for you but I'll give it to you later. - Okay. - What's up? All right, Daddy, look. So I've been thinking about the first quarter, right? We need to take Chance Vision to the next level. Noel. Daddy, not to take away from the foundation you've set, but it is time to turn it up a notch. Look, it all sounds good but- - But to maintain our level of excellence we really gotta be aware of the times, Daddy. Look. This digital era has gone from zero to 100 really quick. Mm-hmm. What, you don't agree? No, it's not that. What have I told you about rushing your approach? You got to take the time to acquire the knowledge. You see what I'm saying? Daddy, I got this. How long are you gonna coddle me in this business? Hm? I've been your vice president for the last three years and one day, I am gonna run this company. - Noel. - Now you've come a long way from selling those movies out your trunk in Philly, right? True that. So you know that change is inevitable. You know I know that better than anybody. Dad, hear me out. For the last four to five years, our films have not been as successful in theaters as they used to be. It's a different time and we need a spark. I'm telling you, Dad, the digital and streaming world is calling our name. I just trying to figure out how. [soft music] Noel. Today is Christmas Day. Yes, Daddy. I know. So forget movies. Forget the past for a minute and just relax. We got this. How are you always this calm? [Garvin laughing] Oh, sometimes I wonder myself. ♪ You can't stand me ♪ Loving you ♪ Loving you ♪ Girl, it just don't make sense ♪ ♪ When we go back and forth like this ♪ ♪ It's plan to see ♪ It's got between you and me [birds chirping] [Naomi laughing] I cannot stop watching this girl online. She is hilarious. I actually ordered a car. So cancel it. Like I said before you rudely brushed me off, would you please stop discussing our issues with your mother? Well, and like I said before, there wouldn't be any issues if you actually cared about my perspective on things. - That's not true. - Yeah and why is it that anytime I make moves with my money, you have a problem with it? Or with anything I do for that matter. Because they're dumb moves and that's your father's money. Why don't you just find something that you're passionate about, you stay focused, you stick to that. That's the way, it's solid. Oh, like you working all hours of the night, right? Nobody gets to ask you what you do with your money. Oh. Am I in debt? No. I'm just a brother that's trying to make partner. Mommy, I wanna see grandma. Yes, sweetheart, that is a good idea. Let's go see grandma. All I'm saying is that we need to be a little bit smarter. Come on, boo. [bottle pops] Well, here's the closing the year out on a high note and taking the weekend off for once. - Thank you, Daddy. - Cheers. Cheers. Dad, did you really just pop a bottle without your favorite daughter? [all laughing] Hey, baby. Here you go. Merry Christmas, baby sister. Where's my niece at? Great to see you too. You finally arrived. Here's to the best daughters in the world. Cheers. Cheers. Ooh, I wanted to run some things by you about the company's annual New Year's Eve party. Yeah, I have some ideas that I think would make the party more lit. Cut it out. You're 36. Can you talk like it? And you're 32, can you please dress like it? Girls, come on! When are you two ever gonna learn that you work better together? Huh? Okay. Naomi, we'll talk after dinner. That's fine and uh, but I do have a couple of things that I wanted to talk to the both of you about, but right now I got to go help your mom and your aunt in the kitchen. Be nice. [aloof music] - What? - You know what. Oh, I was just joking. You look nice or whatever. Naomi, stop playing around. You know what I'm talking about. Oh, please. It's not that serious. Naomi, not paying your taxes, like really? Ooh. When dad finds out about, ooh. He's not gonna find out and you better not tell him. You haven't paid your taxes in three years. That is beyond irresponsible. [Naomi, scoffs] You act like that makes me a bad person or something. I mean, how am I supposed to keep track of everything every year, you know? With all the things going on in life, Not everyone's a walking calendar. Look. Take this and please do us both a favor and remember to pay it. And despite our differences, you're my sister. And I always got your back. Hmm. Well, you remind me not to leave open mail around you anymore. You're welcome. Mama, hand me that potato salad. [Jo] Here you go, baby. - Mama bear. - Oh, there she is. Merry Christmas, baby. Merry Christmas. It's about time. [Naomi laughing] Auntie Jo. Glamorous as usual. Merry Christmas, love. Merry Christmas. - Hey, cuz. - Hey. Ooh, girl, let me check out. Yes, honey. [laughing] Y'all need help? No, baby, we're just about done but you're right on time. You know, I really think it's about time you and Auntie Jo hire some help to do all this cooking. Y'all let me know. I know dozens of world-class chefs who could do this for you. Uh, thank you Miss Noel, but we got this. Everything is not a job, Noel. We love this. We get to spend time, drink and gossip. If the matriarchs want to prepare a great meal for a family so be it. Oh, let you tell it. Oh, I cook for a family every night, honey. Nobody in your household got food poisoning? Hm. Shocking. Oh, please, baby sis, last time you cooked, Jesus and his apostles gathered at a long table. See, you know what, the last time you- - Hey, hey, hey, hey. You two just stop it. This is Christmas for God's sake. You two always do this. You, you go after each other like alley cats. Now, Noel, you get the big utensils and... Do you hear me talking to you? - Yeah. - Okay. And Naomi, you go make sure the table's set perfectly. You always give me the baby job. Girl. Just go. Jesus Christ. [people chattering] [doorbell ringing] [upbeat festive music] Hey, everybody! Y'all remember Keith. Yes, of course. How are you, Keith? Would you care to join us? No, no, Mrs. Chance. I just, unfortunately not. I just came by to tell your husband thank you for some business advice he gave me. With a little champagne. That was very nice. Thank you. Uh, you remember my daughter, Noelle? Don't you? Of course. Hi. Hi. Yeah. Oh. It's your birthday, right? Happy birthday to you. Thank you. Oh, it is your birthday. Happy birthday, Noel. Thanks y'all. Thank you. How could we forget? We always do that. Aw, you only forget what you want to forget. It's a pleasure to see everyone again and I will be letting myself out. [laughing] Happy holidays. You too, baby. Terri. [people chattering] May I have everyone's attention please? If I can ask everyone to raise a glass. As this year comes to a close, I would like each of us to, um... [soft music] Hm. I would like, I would like each of us to look at the year that we've had. Not the bad times, but with the thought that everything that didn't go your way, everything happens for a reason. That's with everything. Look, take a look at the stuff that didn't go right for you and you'll find that it went in your favor in the end anyway. Okay. [chuckles] I can feel you. I'm not gonna talk long, I swear, because I know you guys wanna dive into the food and eat some of this delicious stuff that my wife and my sister-in-law prepared. But I do want you to keep a conscious mind never to take anything for granted, not your family, not your health, opportunity or money, anything that can be here today and gone tomorrow. So, here's to life, laughter and love. Cheers. [All] Cheers.

[Garvin grunting] Oh my God, he's having a heart attack! Oh my God, Daddy. [Sheryl] Garvin. Baby, just breathe, baby. Breathe! Somebody call 911 now! [people yelling] Breathe baby, breathe, just breathe. [solemn music] [birds chirping] I have to admit, I wasn't ready. I wasn't ready to walk in my fathers shoes. I wasn't ready to take care of my mother and my sister. But as he would always say, "Stay ready so you don't have to get ready." Yeah. Well, I'll just get started. Won't make this any longer than it has to be. Again, I am so sorry for your loss. Um... As you know, I was your father's attorney for over 20 years. He meant a lot to me. Thank you, Miles. Okay. To start off, Garvin left control of all of his assets to you, Sheryl, that means all bank accounts, real estate properties and cars and valuables. Naomi and Noel will receive a payment of $20,000 a month until the family funds evaporate or their untimely deaths. Naomi, your daughter, Ryan, will receive a lump sum of $500,000 when she reaches the age of 21. Now, there are other incentives left to you all, other family members and friends, but I will deal with those people individually. Now, as far as Chance Vision is concerned... [suspenseful music] Uh... All control of the company has been left to Noel Chance. And Naomi. [dramatic music] Equally. What? Me? - Her? - Oh shit. She hasn't worked at the company a day in her life. Yeah. Um... Well, according to the records, that's what he wanted from the beginning. Uh, wait, um, unfortunately there is more. Yeah, I don't know if this is the best time to say it, but I feel obligated to do so. Um... There is plenty of liquid cash available to meet Garvin's request. However, if the company continues the way it's been, mixed with your lifestyle, it will evaporate. Rapidly. Are you saying that we're broke? No. Not yet. I will say that Chance Vision has seen it's best days. And to be quite frank, the doors will close sooner than later. Now, if you have any questions or concerns, um, I'll be in the kitchen. [chuckling] Making a plate. I saw some mac and cheese that had my name on it. Looked delicious. [chuckles] Thank you, Miles, and help yourself. Look, to be honest, I saw it coming. The company is dated and we'll be in the red by the end of this fiscal year if I don't do something quickly. I think you mean we, and I mean, he just said we are not broke. Yet. And, you know, you can just stay at home if you gonna take Chance Vision as serious as those dead end companies you started. Whatever, Noel. They weren't dead end companies. Well, let me refresh your memory. Does Tulip tummy tea treatments ring a bell? Who knew tulips were seasonal? - I liked the tea. - Mom! Fine. I can't do it. I'm not the business woman that you know who is. - Facts. - You know what? Look, let's just stop all this bickering about the past. Okay? Now, your father's wishes, God rest my dear sweet husband's soul, they have been spoken. Now, you two are now in charge of the company. This is gonna be a new chapter for Chance Vision. Okay? Ugh! [light upbeat music] [suspenseful music] Sheryl, listen, um... Things are far worse than I said they were. You know what, Miles? Can we please just talk about this another time? It's just too much. Uh, yeah, yeah... Of course. ♪ Back when I was a child ♪ Before life removed all the innocence ♪ ♪ My father would lift me high ♪ And dance with my mother and me and then ♪ ♪ Spin me around till I fell asleep ♪ ♪ Then up the stairs he would carry me ♪ ♪ And I knew for sure I was loved ♪ ♪ If I could get another chance ♪ ♪ Another walk, another dance [Noel] What now, Daddy? ♪ I'd play a song that would never ever end ♪ [Sheryl] I don't understand why you put so much pressure on yourself when you have help around. Me? Mom, you about to put up a whole Christmas tree by yourself. Putting up Christmas tree decorations is nothing like running a company. Sweetie, you need to give yourself a break sometimes. A break? My company has put out two flops this year, I can't take a break. [Sheryl] Now, that's not true, so don't say that. It's been a year since Miles told us we're going broke. And don't say that either. Mom, somebody's got to try to save this company and our lives. Not to mention my so-called partner or lack thereof is absolutely no help. That is what your father always wanted. Naomi has completely disregarded everything that was in place before she got there. She doesn't show up to the office and if she does, if she does, she's late. She wasn't even thinking about the company. - Well, she is now. - Barely! And can you please just take my side for once? Maybe you could fake it. There are no sides. Just stop it. You two are always doing this. [suspenseful music] - Shit. - Uh. Excuse me, young lady? Look, I know that you're stressed. Mom, I'm gonna call you back. [Sheryl] Noel? [Noel clears throat] - Look like a mess. - Noel? - Hey. - Hey. Is everything okay? You know what? Somebody made a whole damn mess with clearly no intentions on cleaning it up. The nerve of people, it's just like... [Keith laughing] Yeah. Yeah. The nerve of people. It just, uh... How you been? It's been awhile. You know, I've really been meaning to come by the house. First of all- Listen. Don't, don't even, don't trip. But I've been, um, I've been good. You know, I haven't gotten out much. You know, work, work, work. Right. Work, work, work. So how are things at the company? You know... I realize my father left me with a lot of work to do. I can imagine. [Noel chuckles] I'll tell you something. If anybody is built to do that, that's you. That feels great for somebody to think that. Thank you. But I heard about you. Congrats. - Mm-hmm. - First look deal. Okay. That's a major. You know, your daddy gave me a lot of advice that could last a lifetime and be honest with you. I wouldn't even be here if it wasn't for him. Hm. My dad would always say, "Everything is gonna happen exactly the way that it's supposed to." Wow. So do you come here often or? Yep. Come right here whenever I need groceries. Right. It makes a lot of sense. [laughing] Wow. Maybe we can exchange numbers. Yes. Uh, I mean... Yeah, sure. Yeah. Keep in contact. We could have a drink. Oh look, I love to drink. We could talk movies, TV and stuff if you're up to it. That sounds good. Yeah. - Yeah. - All right, well, good seeing you, take care. You too. [soft music] Do you come here often? Of course she comes here often. Really, Noel? "I love to drink"? That shit was brilliant. [sighs] [pan clinking] - Ryan. - Yeah? You staying focused? Yeah. Okay. Let me... Let me check and see what you got. Ryan! Come on. This is unacceptable. Now, you're gonna have to learn how to do your work without me sitting here holding your hand. Why do I have to do homework? It's stupid. Listen to me, baby. You're not gonna be a little girl forever. There's gonna come a time in your life when you have to take things more seriously and you have more responsibility. You mean like Auntie Noel? Like Auntie Noel? Yeah. I wanna be a boss like her. [tense music] All right, now, I hope everyone had a great Thanksgiving, but it's time to get back to it and close this year off on a strong note. Over the last 20 years, this ever changing industry has increased it's outlets tremendously. Television studios and network productions have transformed into studios for movies and TV. And with your long standing brain as a notarized TV production company and us on the film side, I think we can merge to become a huge conglomerate in this industry. Now, Samantha, with that being said, I present to you CSV. In translation, Chance-Standard Vision. [Samantha chuckles] Original content across the board. Like a small studio. This is interesting. Exactly. And with the demand for episodic TV and indie films, I really think we'll both benefit from each other's notoriety. Not to mention creating an app down the line with strictly our content on it. And this means new and exclusive content that you only could get if you have our subscription. And all of your old content and our content will be made available to go along with new material produced by you and us. Beautiful. This would be amazing. Do you have something particular in mind that you want to go into production with top of the year? So, still, our team, we're working out some kinks and logistics, but we'll be ready very soon. Well, let's do that. Things across town have slowed down because of the holidays, but I want to make a big splash going into the new year. My thoughts exactly. [soft music] [elevator whirring] [Naomi sighs] [elevator dings] Oh no, there's gonna be a lot of changes around here. - Seriously? - What? You're late. It's 11:30. - What'd I miss? - Hm. Everything. Maybe you should start checking your company email. I mean, you are co-CEO. I don't need a reminder. Look, we have a potential deal on the table to merge with Samantha West and Standard. Along with her team, we're just working on some kinks in logistics. Why? Why, what? Why are you merging with them? I can't even remember the last time they had a great show. You know, that's not what the ratings say, Naomi. Okay, let me stop you right there, baby sis. What do they have that we don't have right here? You mean besides a bottomless budget? They have a long history of success in the television space whereas we'd have more success with film. Naomi, we have to do something quick or this company is gonna fold. Well, then why don't we just build our own TV division? Then we could just walk into the networks on our own. - No- - Oh. - Hey, cuz. - Hey. - Hey. - Hey. Okay, so just a reminder, you got to get ready for your one o'clock Zoom call. Okay and don't forget your two o'clock with the company's attorney. Ooh, and what day did you want to go through that last walk through for the New Year's Eve party? - Ooh, now we're talking! - Right? Especially since we didn't do it last year, we got to come back with a bang! Honestly, y'all, my mind is on this Samantha deal. You know, I came across this girl online and she is so funny. - Online? - Her name is Vida Rimone. She does these skits and I mean, super hilarious. Ooh wait, I went to high school with her. Vida Rimone has always been funny. Like always. Y'all still cool? You know what? Yeah. I mean, we talk here and there. Ooh, let me show you her web series 'cause it's hot. Timothy, you're going to eat. No. I'm not. I'm calling your father. Call him! [both laughing] Right? Crazy. So she has like her own TV show on a, on a website of hers? Yep and she's got mad content, like so much. Listen guys, I don't need an internet sensation. I need security and that is what Standard has for Chance Vision. Do I have a say in this deal? Oh and you got a Zoom call? Should I be in on that too? I guess, Naomi. Ooh, Terri. Yeah? Let's get that email over to Samantha's team, that way when she gets to the office, they'll have it. Okay, got cha. I don't want them waiting on us for anything. Mr. Bernie! [Bernie laughing] Hey ladies! Hey, Mr. Bernie. I barely see you around here. How are you? - We barely see her. - Life is good. Even when it ain't. [laughing] Amen. Mr. Bernie is always dropping gems. I was gonna stop in and check on your mom but I didn't want to be a pest. Hey, you stop it. Mr. Bernie, you are family. You can never be a pest, you hear me? Oh, thank you. Man, I miss Garvin. [solemn music] I was just thinking about when you two were kids. Garvin couldn't stop talking about you too. Made me think about when you was just an intern here, Noel. The best damn coffee maker in the industry. That didn't last long. When you brought that script, "Taking my Lead", to your father. Our highest grossing movie to date. Just thinking, having you two working around here together is just what this company could use. Some new energy. Well, I'm gonna quit running my mouth and get on out of here. So good to see you ladies. Y'all have a great day. Thanks, Mr Bernie. - See you later, Mr. Bernie. - Bye, bye. [Noel] All right, let's go. That Zoom went great. I feel like we got a lot accomplished, covered a lot of ground. I bet. No one else could get a word in. All right, so if you haven't noticed, we changed a couple of things around the office since the last time you graced us with your presence. This is the development department. One head, three employees, a few interns. They read, breakdown all- - All the scripts that come in. The beats, message, character goals. Dad has been making films with that approach since the very beginning. Hmm. You were listening, huh? This is editing. We do sound, color-correction, ADR session. Hey, guys. Oh, look at that shot. That should zoom in. Get a good closeup, right? Well, what you mean is the medium two-shot then we cut to the wide establishing shot to end the scene. Yup. That. I know my stuff. [chuckles] Kinda. Maybe y'all need me around more than I thought. Ha. [Terri laughing] Oh, so you thought that was funny? Okay. No. No. I am swamped in this whole Davrow Motors case. You don't even know what I'm coming in here for. What? I got a new happy ending spot. And no, you don't have to jeopardize your marriage. - Absolutely not. - Come on, Marcus. Bro. Discovery. I'm in deep. I don't even know if I'm gonna get out of this case, bro. You know what? When you make partner, you gotta buy me one of them fly suits, at least to make it up. Marcus, got a minute? Sure thing. This is Meagan Wright. As of today, she is our newest associate, comes highly recommended. I want her to work on the Davrow Motors case with you. I am really excited. Um, I've heard great things about the firm and you, Marcus. I just won that product liability class action with your friend, Justin Curson. Oh, Justin? Yeah, Justin and I went to Howard Law together. Yes. I know. Very well. Now that that's all been established. We're close to closing this case. You want to settle it out before Christmas week. I do not want to go to trial. I know I can depend on you all to be sure to make everything I need accomplished. Looking forward to working with you both. Likewise. - Punch? - Yeah. Another time. Definitely need a happy ending today. He tripping. Come on, man. [Marcus laughing] [crickets chirping] Thank you. - Hey, baby. - Hey. Hey. Hey, Ryan. Hi. I'm telling you, these insurance companies, they're the cheapest people. This Davrow Motors case is killing me. Oh baby. You need me to go up there and talk to Herman? Yes. [Naomi laughing] Ryan. I had a tough day myself. Did you have a tough day at school? No, Daddy. No, my baby didn't have a tough day. You guys got some takeout? Oh yeah, we just grabbed it on the way in. Where's mine? Oh, well I figured that you would have grabbed something like you always do when you work late. You mean you couldn't even just call me to ask me for my order? Well, you could have called me and tell me that you didn't eat. That's selfish. - Excuse me? - It's selfish. Did you not hear me tell you that I had a long day myself? Oh, the job thing. See how long that lasts, right? Wow. [laughs] What the hell is that supposed to mean? That means I'm hungry. [Naomi sighs] [suspenseful music] [elevator dings] [phone dings] [upbeat festive music] I'm gonna kill Naomi. I'm gonna kill her. - Oh morning, cuz. - Where the hell is Naomi? Um, well she was just right here. She was where? Where is she? - She's uh... - Hm, somebody late. What the hell is this? Oh, relax baby sister. This place needs some new energy. No, what the hell do you think you're doing to my company? It looks like a ghetto ass North Pole in here. - Your company? - Yes, my company. Listen, this ain't a damn night club, Naomi, and it will not be ran like one. You do realize we have one of the biggest meetings of the year tomorrow. Well, just because you can't have fun and put in work at the same time, doesn't mean that I can't. I will be ready. Yeah, well, you really better be. Hm. Hm. [people chattering] [Sheryl] Ooh, I like this. I agree. It's lovely. [Sheryl] Yes. Well, I'll take it. Great. Enjoy. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Hmm. Hello Peter. Hi! How are you? [Sheryl] Good. Thank you. You look absolutely beautiful as always. - Thank you. - Nice to see you. Good to see you too. I love this. I will take it. This is absolutely awesome. I'm getting ahead of my Christmas shopping. - Okay. - Yeah. Beautiful. And we make it in three colors. So keep it in mind for the future, if you want the other two colors. I will. But I'll just take that today. Thank you. Okay. How's everything? - Everything's great. - Good. [machine buzzes] Declined. Oh, well, uh, you know, let me try... It happens. There's a lot of fraud. Security alerts. Okay. Let's try this one. This is a good one. [machine buzzes] Declined. Oh. [laughing] Wow, well okay. Well you know what, Peter? Third time's a charm. That's what they say. And this one should be just fine. Ooh, this is a good one. It feels different. [Sheryl laughing] [machine dings] We're good. It's yours. All right. Thank you. Um, just wrap that up for me. - I will. Thank you. - Thank you. All right, now, the last time we met, we talked about merging our old content and producing new content to be available to the consumer. Very eager to hear what you've come up with. Thank you, Samantha. Much appreciated. And now, here's our new app for CSV Max. Now, this interactive app with hold the best new content along with old that people are dying to stream. [Derek] And along with the live action app, we can maybe have a podcast division. Which is a part of a growing industry. People ride in their cars listening to podcasts. People want information. All of this sounds amazing, very innovative and fresh. I want to move forward with this. I'm sold. So, what are your ideas for the new content? [Noel] Well, what I was thinking was is- - Naomi. Is there something wrong? No. I'm straight. Well, you look like you have a lot on your mind. You have something to add? Well, there's this new young creator you know, her name's Vida Rimone, she's the hottest thing out there. Oh. [laughing] I'm very familiar with that name. My daughter talks about her all the time. [Naomi] Oh yeah, well, I just think that that's the content that we should be moving towards. Oh, I'm into it. I am into it. Let's dig into this. I want to hear a pitch. [Naomi laughing] Okay. [Naomi sighs] [phones ringing] That went okay today, kinda. I got to tell you, little sis, something about that Samantha just does not sit right with me. And I also think that I ran my mouth a little too much today. You think? I'm serious. I just, I got, you know? Caught up in the moment. I just... I think that we can still run this ourselves. We can do it ourselves. Naomi, it takes time to grow from nothing. You don't understand that. We need a lifeline. Okay. I'm heading home. I gotta go, you know, pick up Ryan, and Marcus is working late again. What's wrong with Naomi? I'm good. Wanna come over later? You haven't seen your niece in awhile. Sorry. I wish I could, but if you must know, I'm meeting someone for dinner. You are? Who? Do you have a date? Who is he? Don't even worry about it, please. It's just dinner. Okay. Well, don't you have to go home and get ready? No, my heels are right there. I'll be fine. [Naomi laughing] Okay. Well, uh... Don't forget we have to, you know, put the final touches on the New Year's Eve party. Night, night.

That shit is hilarious. But it was inevitable. I was doing way too much. I mean... You thought you were the boss, huh? Hmm, man, I'm telling you, you couldn't tell me I did not own that studio. [both laughing] Ooh, that's good. Yeah, so, what's up with you? You know, what happened on your journey? Well, growing up, watching my dad take loss after loss and then go on a hell of a win streak, that was the beginning for me. I never had another job. I went straight from college to Chance Vision. To VP. Hell no. See, mm-mm. Garvin Chance didn't give me anything easy ever. - Oh really? - No. I worked my way up just like you, as an intern, but people will swear I'm in position because of my father. That's why you go so hard, prove people wrong. To a degree, I guess. Just know I ain't get nothing easy from my father. If I could not do the job, I wasn't getting the job. Even down to playing pool. He would kick my until I went home, crying to my mother. [laughing] That's what made you tougher. Gave you that tough skin so by the time you stepped foot into Chance Vision, you were ready. Exactly. Ready from the start. Whew, now I've got to... Now it's all on me. Well... Me and my sister. How's that working out? Hm. It's going all right I guess, but I feel like I don't have a choice but to, to make it work, especially because we have this deal on the table with Samantha West. - At Standard? - At Standard. So basically what we want to do is build like a mini studio, right? Their TV content, our movie database, but in a subscription app. - Right. That makes sense. - It makes sense, right? Mm-hmm. I'm talking about work too much. - No, no. - I am. I am. Just be honest. It's okay. You know, I never really tried my hand at TV. But a good friend of mine, Michael Green, is trying to do something similar. You know he just became the head of TV over at GTI Streaming. Yes, I know. The Michael Green. I have been a fan of his since I was a kid. Actually he would be the ideal person I would want to build my vision with this company. What he's done with the television space, literally a dream come true. I'm sorry. [laughing] It's okay. Noel, I said I was not gonna turn this into a work meeting and I'm talking about work. I just wanted to put it out there. It's fine. What are you doing for the holidays? Well... It's going to be the first one without my dad so it's gonna be a different kind of holiday. Not to mention it's my birthday and the day that he passed, it's a lot to even think about. - That's right. - Mm-hmm. But I'll be straight. You know, holidays just aren't the same without my mother. [solemn music] You know, when she died, it just lost that family feel, you know? She was the glue. Trust me, I get it. My dad would always say that things in life are temporary, which is why I was always so scared at the thought of getting attached to somebody and knowing it could just end abruptly, and then my dad dies out of nowhere is... Hm. I'm here for you if that means anything. It does. Thank you. I appreciate that. [Noel clears throat] So, uh, if I decide to show up to the venue on New Year's Eve do I get a all access pass? Hm. I don't know, I'll see what I can do. I want something flashy over here. Not the usual Christmas lights that my father and sister would go for. See, you are talking my language, mama. I'm thinking pinkish lights streaming across the walls. Yes. Yes. So let's make this a party to celebrate my father, but mark a new reign. Mm-hmm. And I was thinking about putting the photo booth over here. I think that's a good place to put it, right? Hey guys, sorry I'm late. Did I miss much? Just about an hour's worth. How'd that hour do on the budget? You may proceed. Again, the photo booth will go over here and the DJ booth will go back here. Oh, I was thinking the DJ would go here, you know, like up on a high, high stage. Yeah. [Noel laughing] She got a new boo or something? Might not be a bad thing. Maybe she get that stick out of her ass. What was that? Moving right along. Hmm. Well, the bar will go right here against the wall taking up that entire space. Yes. Okay guys, are we almost done? I have a really busy day. Oh, really. Is that right? Carl, I'm sure it's gonna be another classic. I'll see you soon. Okay? - I'll see you. - Yeah, whatever. She must be. Listen, she just popped right in. I know, right? - This space is amazing. - I know, it's beautiful. You're gonna love it. Oh, let's kill this. Oh my God. I love the suit for the record. How was the drive in? Good, thank you. Mrs. Chance, let me start out by offering my condolences for Garvin. He was an amazing person. Well, thank you. I really appreciate that, Mr. Payton. No, call me Dan. Please have a seat. When my assistant told me you were selling the company, I got to admit I was shocked. Your husband has a hell of a catalog. This will be a great opportunity for us. Yes, I also think that it's best for the family, you know, to branch off into some new endeavors. Now, correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't he leave the company to your daughters? Yes, this is true, but you just leave that part up to me. Sounds good to me. ♪ Blessings and love on this time of year ♪ ♪ There's something about when the family's here ♪ ♪ On Christmas, on Christmas ♪ Blessings and love on this time of year ♪ ♪ It's something about when the family's here ♪ ♪ On Christmas, on Christmas [Noel] The only reason my family ever put any real energy into the holidays was because my father always believed the spirit of the season was based on giving is better than receiving.

[Marcus laughing] It didn't really feel like that. - Hmm. - Oh, not until now. I mean... Her and her sister, they taken over the company. That's if they don't kill each other first. I see. A little bit of an adjustment. [Meagan laughing] You sure you wanna do this? 'Cause I told you I was all city in high school so... Yeah, that's back when they was playing on the Peach Baskets, right? About 30 years ago. Oh, that's cute. Ooh, you got some jokes. Ooh, Marcus is funny. Go on, Dr. Naismith. It's a joke to you, bet. It's a bet. Come on. [laughing] You okay? It's just this thing with Naomi. [Meagan] Mm-hmm? We haven't been on the best of terms and now- - Instead of supporting a new endeavor, you downplayed it. How you know that? And not to mention, you've just been so busy going after your own goals, you didn't even realize she's going after her own thing too. How am I gonna tell her that I made partner when I haven't even been supporting her? Wait, what? You did what? Yeah. Herman told me earlier today. Oh my gosh. [Marcus laughing] I'm so happy for you. - It's crazy. - Congrats. [laughing] I'm proud of you. [laughing] Hey, baby. [suspenseful music] I thought you might be hungry, or more so thirsty. Naomi, Meagan. Meagan, Naomi. Hi. Yes. It's so nice to finally meet you. I heard so much about you. It's funny. I haven't heard anything about you. Oh no, babe. Meagan is the the one that helped us out with the Davrow Motors case. Gotcha. Well, um... I'm gonna head over to my office. I'm pretty sure it's time for me to go home. So um, it was so nice to meet you. [nervously chuckles] Don't forget your shoes. [Meagan nervously chuckles] [Meagan clears throat] Your little work wife is cute. [crickets chirping] [Noel] It is me and you if I fall. Keith, I'm not playing. You just keep quiet otherwise you're gonna scare away the rats. The rats?! Uh-uh. I'm gonna open my eyes. Don't you open those eyes. Now walk, you're almost there. Right about there. Open them. [soft music] Oh. [laughing] You were listening, huh? Of course. Wow. Okay. I have not played pool in a long time. Maybe it's time for you to knock that rust off. Oh, so you saying you ready to get this work? Hey, be careful what you ask for. [Noel chuckles] Hm, you know, today was not a good day for me. It was the first time I had to go Christmas shopping without my dad so, you know? But this just made me feel 10 times better. So thank you. I got you. And this ass-kicking I'm about to give you is about to make me feel 20 times better. - Okay. - All right. You ready? - I'm ready. - All right. Mm.

My mail. Uh-uh. Okay. So I just want to know who he is. Has Samantha called? No, not yet. That's weird. She was agreeing with this. We're trying to close before Christmas. Uh-huh. So... Cuz. Who is it? Well, if you must know... Keith Austin. [Terri gasping] - Shh. - The producer? Ooh. [laughing] Hey, Noel. I'm still having doubts about this deal. Look, Samantha was a good friend of daddy's for years and a close friend to the company. Are you sure he was a close friend of dad's or just a person who worked in the same industry? Naomi, we're good. Okay? We did not sign a contract yet, she can't make a move that we wouldn't know about. We're good. Okay. If you say so. [upbeat festive music] Keith Austin. Samantha West. This is a surprise. No such thing. Everything happens for a reason. So what can I do for you? I'll make this quick. I'm making a few changes to my network and I want you to be head of film. You'll have your very own staff and full control over the department. Not to mention, a very lucrative base with incentives. You don't need to decide right now, but I do need an answer by next week. Wow, that's funny 'cause didn't you recently just have a meeting- Merry Christmas, Keith. [doorbell rings] - Hey. - Miles! How are you? Yeah. I'm good. I'm good. Come on in. Well, I've been trying to get ahold of you by phone for the last couple of days. Maybe even a week. I know. I'm sorry. It's just been such a hectic month. Right. We go through this every few months. Look, I'm just trying to help. And you guys need a lot. Okay, Miles. What's going on? Well, I've been going through the family financials. Okay, so how serious is it now? Well, to be quite frank, you can no longer afford this estate. [dramatic music] And the good news is that the real estate market is very strong right now so you'll have no problem selling this property. Now you probably won't make what you put into it because it's so custom to you, but it's still worth a pretty penny. Miles, no! This home is the heart of my family and I can't imagine leaving here. I know what you mean. Now, I feel the same sentiments, but Chance Vision can no longer sustain this level of living. God. I'm so sorry. - Oh, come on, love. - Okay, I'm just saying. - Just saying. - All right. So what I was saying was... What? Maybe I could grant you an all access pass to the New Year's Eve party. - Oh yeah? - Mm-mm. [both laughing] Do I get to bring a plus one plus one? A plus one like who? Ah, you know, I might just want to have a date with me on my arm. So you know, neither you or your date will make it into the new years messing with me. - Ouch. - Ouch, yes. Ouch, yes, that's it. I'm just playing with you. [both laughing] Yeah. Actually... I want you to be my plus one. I would love that. [phone ringing] Go on, answer it. No, it's cool, I'm good. Answer it. It might be business. Go ahead. Hey Terri, what's up? You good? Where the hell you been? Okay. Have you seen any of my texts? No. I'm on a date with Keith. Look, do yourself a favor and check your messages and let me know if you need me to come over there and help you with him. Girl, help me with him for what? What are you talking about? [Terri] Look at your messages and call me back. All right. Bye. [suspenseful music] Noel, you know, I already got the suit I did and I'm thinking about putting on already, right? It's gonna be so beautiful. So fly. So... [laughing] Look, I can explain. I'm listening. Samantha comes by my job one day with this random ass offer. What did she say? Tell me everything. She said she starting to film division and she wanted me to head it. You didn't think to tell me that? Yes. But I didn't think she was gonna write no blog about it. What has the blog got to do anything about it? You were supposed to tell me. Wow. You ain't shit for that. Noel. Come on, now. Is this what you came around me for? I did not say yes. But did you say no? - Noel. - You didn't. Wow. Okay. - Noel, come on now. - Don't Noel me. Noel! Soon as you brag about a nigga, they embarrass you. [solemn music] [Naomi gasps] Oh my God. Mommy, it says "Boss lady." I love this so much. I'm so happy you like it, sweetie. Here. Noel, open your gift. Mom. I'm good. I'll do it later. Why'd you call us in here? Merry Christmas to you too. I called you here for something serious. I mean, I hate talk about this on Christmas, but I don't know when we will all be together in a room again. Now, don't say that. We've just been busy at the office. That's all. You know, maybe you're right, but it's come to the point where we need to slow things down. - What? Slow what down? - Our lifestyle. As much as I hate to admit it, Miles was right. We haven't made the money that we're accustomed to the past few years. So, what, what are you saying? Girls, I'm sorry, but we... We can no longer afford to live in this estate. What the hell is that supposed to mean? I mean, Mom, you just spent God knows how much on decorating and not to mention these gifts. Excuse me, but for your information, I have been cutting back on my spending. Oh, I can't tell. Whatever work needs to be done around here, I don't need pressure from y'all if y'all not putting in the work with me. Okay, I think you've been putting a little too much whiskey in your eggnog, baby sister. Don't talk to me like I'm your child. Just look. Calm down. I have a plan. This will solve all of our problems. Yeah. What's that? [dramatic music] Absolutely not. We're not selling the company. Are you crazy? - Noel. - Ah! This is the way you choose to honor my father today? Noel, would you calm down? I'm not calming down. You know how hard my father worked to build this catalog he has today and you just want to throw it away for some pennies? How could you disrespect my dad like that? Look. This plan can solve most of our problems. We can start all over again and build a new catalog. And is she in on it too? [Sheryl] No. She doesn't know anything about this. Noel, look, we just need to find a- - Whoa, whoa, Daddy didn't leave the company to we. He left it to me. And me. And you know what? Whatever. I say no. And if y'all want to help out with this company, how about y'all try not helping with the company? [upbeat festive music] [Terri] Ooh! Oh, thank you, auntie. I love it. Oh, you're welcome, sweetie. Noel, baby, why don't you come over here and open the rest of your gifts? Mom, I'll be over there later. You act like this every year. Maybe you'll snap out of it when you finally get a family of your own. You mean like your favorite daughter? Naomi. Hm? It's always gotta be about her. Always. What'd you say? 'Cause I am two seconds off your ass for that shit you pulled in that meeting with Samantha. Or is it just possible that I came up with a better idea than you? Yeah. That's what I think it is. I can just see the insecurity just jumping right off of you. Naomi, stop it. Now, you know she didn't mean it. She just angry. Nah, you know what? Y'all make me sick. All my life you cater to her and you treat me like I ain't shit. Look, little girl. You watch your mouth. Now I let you slide the first time, but you watch your mouth in my house. This ain't your house, this my daddy house. You just live in it. You're drunk. You need to go lay down before I slap the shit out of you. No, she could do the simplest things and you throw a parade for her, but I bust my ass to be great and all I ever get was a pat on the back. Well, that's your fault. That is your problem because you expect a congratulations for every little damn thing that you do. You better mind your business because all you know how to do is spend money and play dress up. Well, you act like you're in control. You act like you know everything, which is why we didn't tell you that daddy was sick 'cause we didn't want to watch you act like you knew exactly what to do to help him. [dramatic music] [Noel sobbing] Everybody knew he was sick except for me? Okay, look guys. Y'all needs to chill. Okay. We need to just let this go. Oh no, no, no. I'm not letting it go. I am so tired of letting it go. I am tired of her talking to me like I am not the older sister. You walk around here like you're some boss bitch. Ain't done right since he died. Yeah. Happy birthday to you. Bitch! [Naomi screams] [both screaming] Naomi, stop it! Naomi, stop! Stop it! Stop it! Naomi! Get up, girl. Stop it! - Noel! - Stop it. - Stop! - It's over! I hate it here!

Look, Mom, I got a lot on my plate so if you're here to tell me how wrong I was, I know Everything you said on Christmas was right. Huh? I wasn't there for you growing up as much as I was with Naomi. - Mom- - No, baby, just... Just hear me out. From the start, you were so strong and independent. You reminded me of myself growing up. I mean, you knew exactly what you wanted and you went after it just like I did. But when your father's company took off, I just, I just fell into this supportive role. I mean, it was so typical. Mom, don't. Don't say that. It was a different era. You and Garvin, you were just so close. I felt like you didn't need me as much. Mom, I did need you. It just seemed like I never impressed you. Oh no, baby. You always impress me. And even more so now. I'm sorry, because I should have told you the Garvin was sick. The stress had become an issue, but the last thing he wanted was for you to know how it was affecting him. I knew something was wrong with him, but Mom, I just felt like he, he had it under control. Oh, baby, we all could have done a whole lot more differently to help. [Noel sniffs] I got to make this right with Naomi. You will. Not to mention, put the finishing touches on the party and figure out what we going to do with our company. You two still want to move forward with this party? Oh, we have to. Daddy looked forward to it every year. Here. I wanted to give this to you when we had a moment the other night. I was too busy acting a fool. Huh? [chuckles] There's more at the house. I really wanted you to have this one. This is your birthday present from last year from your father and I. And it's just so sad that he was unable to give it to you. And I didn't think that it was appropriate until now. [soft piano music] Wow. [laughing] Noel Chance. CEO of Chance Vision. It's the one you got daddy when he first got his production deal. The best birthday present ever. [TV] Here's a Christmas present... [bell ringing] Look, Daddy! Teacher says, "Every time a bell rings, an angel gets his wings." That's right. That's right. A few of us, we're gonna go out to officially celebrate the case. Want to come? I think I'll pass. What's the problem? Oh, you wanna know what my problem is? It'd be a start. You're my problem. And the way you treat me like a servant a and not like your wife. Because I asked you for a little bit of support, I'm treating you like a servant? What'd you just say? [scoffs] Is that the best that you got and you call yourself an attorney? You know what? I'm not even gonna do this. Don't try to manipulate this. Don't try to manipulate this! You act like you're the only one that's trying to do something big. I'm sorry I don't have a multi-million dollar company handed to me by a rich daddy. I had to grind for everything and I need a little bit of support from my wife. You know what? And since we in the spirit of truth telling, when's the last time we were alone and you gave me any type of intimacy? Intimacy?! [scoffs] Maybe you should have taken more courses in biology or psychology for that matter and less in criminal law for you to understand this feminine mind, honey. Well, maybe you should have paid attention to your mother and how she kept her husband. Well, I guess you summed it all up with that one. Sure did. [Naomi sighs] [Naomi sighs] Shit. [soft music] [suspenseful music] Hey, it's me. Look, I know you're not messing with me right now, but I really need you. [upbeat dance music] - What the hell is this? - We might need it. Now, where is she? Is that her? - Oh, yeah. - Okay. Let's go. Where's my husband? Please don't do this here. No, no, you're not gonna tell me what to do, but you can't tell me where he is. Our entire firm is right over here. Okay. Let's just go talk right over there. Mm-hmm. Okay. Enough is enough. All right. They still act that you got going on. Mm-mm. It's done. It's over. I got your number. Hold on. What act? I got it. She really not trying to hear all that. He's married and I know that you know things have not been perfect, but that's my husband and I love him. Yeah. Something you look like you don't know about. Hold on. Wait a minute. [laughing] Is there a problem here? - Oh. - You tell me. Uh, babe. I got this. Thank you though. Thank you. Babe? Yes. As in my girlfriend, Skylar. - So, your girlfriend? - Mm-hmm. Nor your BFF? Girlfriend, yes. - Oh damn. - Oh, okay. Um. I got it. Trust me. Okay, so um... I'm gonna go to the car. But you keep this. What you talking about? Would you get that thing outta here! Mm-hmm. Okay. [Naomi sighs] [Naomi nervously chuckles] Wow. Well I'm so sorry, Meagan. You know what? It's okay. I can't even stand here and act like I haven't been exactly in your shoes and done exactly what you just did. Well, uh, where the hell is he? He's actually on his way home to you. Yeah. He said that he didn't like celebrating without you. Oh my God, and my ghetto ass is over here acting a mess. I'm so, I'm... Don't beat yourself up about it. Okay, well, can you tell your girlfriend that I'm sorry too? Okay. Oh, and that I love her shoes. No problem. Do you have any plans for New Year's Eve? - Girl. - Do not say one word. Do not speak. I cannot hear it right now. You don't even know what I was about to say. Well, I did it this time. I keep my title as the girl that just cannot get shit right. - Don't say that. - Oh. Now, don't. Don't start being nice to me now. Come on. I am the worst, big sister ever. No, you're not. It was funny. All this time I have been acting like... Like I hate certain things about you, but the truth is I admire them. [soft music] Even your birthday being on Christmas. That's pretty cool. I was just being a brat. I just, I think I just always wanted to be the kind of sister that you could depend on. Well, um... I've always looked up to you. Might've never said it. Always envied your confidence, the way you could walk into a room and just command attention with your smile. Hell. I always thought the only way I can get attention was if I got straight A's. Not to mention, I can never dress like you. Well, I suck at everything else. I still don't know why dad gave me the company too. I mean, I just keep losing. I'm probably gonna lost my damn husband when he finds out about this. We're gonna figure this out. [Naomi sighs] What did daddy always say? There's a lesson in every loss. Okay. Well, I do have one question. What? A bat? A bat? [Noel laughing] What the hell were you gonna do with this? Why do you even have this thing? Girl, I use it for protection. I ain't got no man. Speaking of which, is Keith coming to the New Year's Eve party? Hmm. Another one bites the dust, sis. It's a long story. But look, thank you for bringing me It really means a lot to me that you asked for my help. You don't do that too often. Hell. Naomi Chance never does that. Thanks for having my back. I said some pretty crazy things to you the other night. You did. [both laughing] You did. No, I probably deserved it and I damn sure didn't expect you to come throwing me over their couch like... [both laughing] Oh, man. And for the record, I always love when you call me baby sister. [both laughing] That hair is cute. Ooh, thank you girl. [engine starts] [solemn piano music] [Noel sighs] Hey Noel. Mr. Bernie? What are you doing here? Just getting the place ready for y'all to come back. I'd ask you the same thing but I think I know the answer. [Noel] Why'd you say that? Your dad used to come in here all hours of the night, all the times of the day. [chuckles] He used to drive your mama crazy. [laughing] You know, I got, uh, I've got to figure something out, Mr. Bernie, or we all gonna be without a job. That's the thing. Garvin mastered the art of trust in his team. A real boss knows how to delegate. Tell me, please, how? Well, he had a confidence. Trusted his moves. And he was always positive. I'm learning. I have a long way to go before I'm anything like my father. Don't be so hard on yourself. He shared with me plenty of ideas that never made it to the surface. Why though? I mean, Daddy always had great ideas. [Bernie chuckles] Yeah. And he would come up with some of the dumbest ideas for movies I ever heard of in my life. [chuckles] That made him slow down, take his time. Shoot when he was open. Pass the ball to a teammate. And he never ever worked with a person that wasn't a good person. [solemn piano music] Exactly. You can get this. I'm gonna head on back. Start doing my work. But Noel, don't doubt yourself. Okay? Yeah. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Bernie. [Noel sniffing] [keys clacking] All right, let's see. [Vida Rimone] You are so hot. [Noel laughing] Your waist is a 16. Your face is a 12. Hey, Terri. real quick. Um... Do you still have that connection to Vida Rimone? Okay. Bet. Send it to me. Thanks. [suspenseful music] [Naomi sighs] - Would you calm down? - I'm calm. I mean, I'm kind of calm. Why are you so calm? Because I know we got this. How can you be so sure? Shh, shh, that's her, [clears throat] Hey! So nice to meet you two. Terri been bragging about her two big cousins ever since high school. But before we start, I just want to say this. I'm really sorry about your dad. We appreciate that, thank you. Yeah. Thanks. And we appreciate you coming to meet us last minute, too. - Of course. - Want some coffee? Uh, yeah, no. Not really my thing. All right, look, we're not gonna waste your time here. We absolutely love your content. Oh. Thanks. And at this point in our company, we've had tons of success with movies, but we want you to lead us into the world of TV. We are offering you a chance to develop your own show. Don't get me wrong. I just, I gotta be honest. I really like my independence, my control, and it might not be as much money, but I own my stuff. And my views online been going up by the thousands every day. No, no, no. We respect that and as you should, right? But the world needs to see your content on a high level. At Chance Vision you'll have full control over what you want to put out, the writer's room and you'll retain partial ownership. That's great. My gosh, it's like my life is just opening up all of a sudden. How so? This is the third offer that I got in the last month and a half. Samantha West, over at Standard. Oh, she threw up a big old bag at me. Y'all know her? No. [Noel clears throat] Um, but are you signing with Standard? I mean, I'm kind of considering it. They don't really have any black content there, you know? And I'll be the first. - But- - That's fine. You know, Vida, you're entitled to choose at your convenience. - Yeah. - But let me just be honest with you here. We need you at Chance Vision, and not just as a creative partner. We specialize in working with great people. Now, we'll give you some time and you let us know when you're ready to sign. In the meantime, what you doing for New Years?

Mommy, none of this happens without you. Uh, about our finances. Don't, don't worry about that. I have a really great... We. We have really great feeling we'll be just fine. Right? What the hell? Happy belated birthday. What are you doing here? Mama, you remember Keith. Yeah. It's nice to see you again, Mrs. Chance. You have a beautiful daughter too. [Sheryl] Well, thank you, Keith. Noel, can I talk to you for a second, please? Okay, look, are y'all gonna stand over here looking cute all night or what? - Yes, let's go. - Let's go. Look, I get Naomi was trying to play matchmaker, gave you an invitation, but I have nothing to say to you. Noel, I messed up, all right? I should have told you about Samantha. So why didn't you? Because things were so good. And I just... I didn't put two and two together. You never said no to her offer and I'm telling you that never sat well- - I should have told you about her from the rip and I'm sorry. Things were going so great between us that I didn't want to bring anything negative to the table early. Noel, I was not gonna take that job. So why didn't you just say that? Because I was trying to, but you never gave me a chance. You just judged the situation and you cannot communicate outside of a business arena. And this is life. Life is not business, it requires real communication, human communication and that's key. And as far as I'm concerned about the Samantha West ordeal, she's gonna be dealt with really soon. She will be hearing from my attorney. Yeah, well, she should be. I'm communicating to you right now that I'm sorry. And I miss you. Mm-hmm. Yeah, you are sorry. You miss me, huh? [upbeat music] I do. How much? A lot. That ain't enough. - Oh, that ain't enough? - That ain't enough. ♪ Say I wanna leave you in the mornin' ♪ ♪ But I need you now, yeah, yeah ♪ [Naomi and Terri giggling] Yes! We did it. ♪ I know you what you like ♪ I feel it comin' ♪ Time is of the essence ♪ I tried to teach you Bartender. [indistinct] We used to cut a rug at this thing. I should have never let it get to this point. I'm sorry. I was so wrapped up with my own career that I couldn't support you when you needed it most. It's both our fault. I was so caught up in building something of my own that I lost sight of some things. And then when I actually started working at the company, I don't know, it was like a fire was lit under me and I lost track of what was important at home. Your father's company is important. That's generational, baby. I should have been there to support you long before that. Well, I owe you a thank you for all the times you supported me in the past and I took it for granted. I'm always gonna be in your corner. I just miss having fun, baby. I know. I hate it here. [Marcus laughing] What the hell is so... Oh, stop. I know, that was so embarrassing. You and your sister. A bat, baby? A bat? Hey, you two. Hi. Aren't you so proud of him? Proud of what? Oh, wait. Oh, you didn't tell her. Okay. Well, I just did that. After we won the case, my firm made me partner. What?! That's amazing! And yes, I'm very proud. I'm not surprised. - Okay. We should get a drink. - Yeah, let's do that. Another one please. [soft music] [people chattering] Oh. I'll be right back. Let me go grab my sister. I'll be back. Aw, y'all so cute. I'm so sorry. Can I borrow her real quick?

I mean, I had to, I wanted to get here before the ball dropped. No date? Girl, no date, but by the looks of this party, girl, I might with a date and a husband. You know what? Something you two said really, really stuck with me. You know, I've been in so many meetings with different companies. You know, all they been trying to do is sign me. Nobody even cares about what type of person that I am. They just trying to throw money at me and they made me feel like I need them. But you two, y'all made it clear that y'all need me. Well, we had a good teacher. And you know what? Not for nothing. I heard what Samantha was trying to do to y'all and who's to say that she wouldn't do that to me? And you know what? To be honest, like I really look up to y'all, like y'all are two fly black women doing this thing at a high level in this industry. Okay? And that does not go unnoticed. So... [Vida laughing] So I guess we can figure out a deal next week or something. Yes! Yes! [both laughing] Well, if y'all will excuse me, black queens. I'm gonna go try to find my first husband. Mm-hmm. [Naomi laughing] You go get 'em. [laughing] [Vida] I will! Uh, wait, Naomi. What's wrong? You were right. About what? Her. She was exactly what we needed. - Thank you. - You're welcome. You know, you will also right about Samantha and you were also right, you know, about us building our own TV department. Are you feeling okay? Where's my sister? I'm feeling good. Don't push it. Okay? You're pushing it. Wait, wait, wait. Was that Vida? That was her. Guess what? - What? - We're signing her. Ooh, yes! Now that's what I'm talking about. Question. Aren't you tired of uh, you know, just being my assistant? Oh, hell no. Okay. I am not being both of y'alls assistants. Y'all asses are crazy. Well, we were thinking more than just an assistant. What do you say to a real promotion? What'd you think about being head of operations at Chance Vision? For real? See? Okay! Now that is what I'm talking about. Ooh! Yes! [laughing] [upbeat music] If you gonna be coming to a Chance party, you gonna have to be right. All right. Now you straight. - You look beautiful. - Thank you. Keith Austin. [Keith laughing] - Mike. - It's a pleasure. Glad you could make it. Yes, yes, yes. Noel, this is Michael Green. Michael Green, this is Noel Chance. Noel, it's a pleasure to meet you. No, no, the pleasure is all mine. Yeah. Mike's the head of TV development at GTI Streaming. Of course he is. Listen, thank you for coming. Do you need anything? Having a good time? I am, but I enjoy myself even more if we could set up a time to meet. I'm a huge fan of your father and what you've done with Chance Vision. I would love to extend ourselves to you if you're interested in an overall TV deal. Wait, whoa. Seriously, just like that? Just like that. I've been a fan of your work since I was a kid, we used to rent all your movies at Blockbuster. Oh. [laughing] Now she's showing my age. [Keith laughing] Listen, let's set up a call for next... Actually, let me talk this over with my sister and we'll get back to you. No pressure. So we'll talk next week. We'll talk next week. [Mike] I look forward to it. Fellas, I gotta run. I got to prepare for this speech, but forgive me, okay? Nice to meet you. Okay. Okay. She's lovely. Well done. [Noel clearing throat] Excuse me. Good evening, everyone. [audience applauding] Right. First and foremost, I would like to thank all of you for coming to Chance Vision's annual New year's Eve party. [audience cheering] Our lovely servers this evening will be handing out glasses of champagne to all of you. Now I'm gonna be quick. I know we only have a couple of minutes before the ball drops, but I need some help. Naomi, come on up here big sis. - Baby. - Okay. [Man] Go on, get up there. [audience cheering and applauding] Come on girl, we ain't got a lot of time. [laughing] All right. Our father would always preach to us about how important family is. Right? And not just family by blood, but the bond you have with someone is what makes them family. Most of you in here have had many interactions with our dad, so y'all know what I'm talking about. [all laughing] This, [sighing] This has been a year like no other for us, but I know daddy would tell us that there's a lesson in every loss And this past year has shown us just how true that is. [soft music] So I guess we'll just leave you with this and of course, this is how our father would end all of his speeches. Let's keep a conscious mind to never take anything for granted, not family, health, opportunity, money or anything that could be here today and gone tomorrow. He would say move genuinely, move with confidence and never, ever doubt yourself. So. [Both] Here's to life, laughter and love. Cheers. [audience applauding] [Audience] aw! [Noel] This past year has definitely been one for the books, but with this family, nothing is surprising. [Crowd] Six! [Noel] So yeah, I'm getting along with my mom and my sister and I might've found love, but we'll see about that. And most importantly, I think we made our dad proud. [Crowd] Happy New Year!
