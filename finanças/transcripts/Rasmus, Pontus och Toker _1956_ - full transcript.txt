Did you say your canary was yellow? - Yes, he's yellow and his name is Cesar. And it was this morning he flew away from me. So please, good Mr. Persson, would you be so kind as to get him back to me! Absolutely! Västanvik's police force is on high alert. We've almost caught him already! - Oh, is that really possible? The entire police force has been told to arrest anyone named Cesar who is yellow! - Oh, thank you very much. - You're welcome. - Anything come in, constable? - Yes, I'd say so. His name is Cesar and he's yellow. - His name is Cesar and he's yellow? Mrs Enoksson's canary. Yes, if this isn't Scotland Yard then my name isn't Patrik Persson. Drunkards and canaries are all we get to deal with! If only we could have just one tiny little safecracker! - Be glad you live in a law-abiding community. Imagine living in Stockholm! - Yes of course. To be up to our elbows in thieves and bandits! Wouldn't that be great! - Apparently they haven't caught that silver thief. - No, those boys in Stockholm don't have much to teach us. You know, If I only knew where he was, then by God, we'd soon have him! He wouldn't be off the hook for long. - Time for you to go out on the beat now, eh? - Yes, I suppose so. So you'll have to write up this report. World-beater Patrik Persson off on the beat! Bye for now! Oh, by the way— if a canary should come in asking for me, tell him to take a seat and wait for a while. Hello there. What kind of building is that? - This is Västanvik's famous grammar school! One of the leading educational institutions in the country. And two of the top students there— are both my children! - Are they really? Thanks so much. - The girl, Patricia—we call her Pricken usually— although her name is Patricia, after me, my name is Patrik— she's in sixth form and she sits up there: second floor, third window from the left. - Well Patricia, what year did Almqvist publish Det går an? Well? Patricia herself has just read it to us. - Yes, but I wasn't listening. - Patricia has never listened. Patricia's mind is elsewhere. What is Patricia thinking about? Yes, thank you. To continue— - Well, so that's the grammar school, is it, yes—thanks— - My little fellow Rasmus, he's still only in primary, but he'll go far. He's every teacher's favourite! You little bastard! Why are you throwing your rubber at Hans-Erik? - I had nothing else. I needed the inkwell myself. Then he said: "You have very beautiful eyes." he said. And then he said— - I think I'll wait for Joakim. You go ahead. - All right. - I've been looking for you. -You arrived so suddenly. - "He comes like the wind", you know. - He comes like a lump! What's this? - Give me that! - No no no. What is it? Joakim von Rencken's sales catalogue. - Give it here. - Look at this. Britt-Marie, who you were going out with before me. And Susann! What exactly does this mean? - It just means I'm selling those chicks cheap. I was afraid you'd have my photo here too. - Don't be stupid now, Pricken. You know I wouldn't put your photo there! - But Joakim, what if it ends between you and me? Then maybe you'll put my photo in your nasty old sales catalogue too and say: Pricken! Going cheap! - I forbid you to talk like that. It'll never end between us! You know that. Tell me you know that. - I'd rather die than be in your old catalogue! Remember that! - Silly Pricken! - Little Toker, have you run away from home again! You know you can't leave home without permission! - You're so lucky to have a dog of your own! - Yes, I like Toker very, very much. He's almost my best friend. And you too, of course. - You're so cute, Pricken! I'm totally crazy about you. - You're so sweet, Pontus! I'm totally crazy about you. Do you have to have brothers? - Yes, no one escapes trials in this life. - You're a trial yourself! - But seriously, he's a really, really cute little brother— - What are you up to? Have you gone completely mad? At least try to control yourself in the street! Little Toker, you're so sweet! - At least try to control yourself in the street— - It's different with a dog. - Look! - Well, we know what we're doing tonight, then. - So Dad gets to do today's maths homework too. Come on. Shall we go to the fairground and dance a few laps before the rehearsal? - I'd be glad to. - I'll come and pick you up. Hey— One thing I forgot— - What? - I love you. - And—one thing I keep remembering: I love you. - Hello. Mum! - Hello Pricken. You do look happy! Did school go well? - School go well? Yes, school certainly did go well! And everything is so lovely! And you're the best in the whole world. - God in heaven, you really are in love with that Joakim! Have you seen Rasmus? - Have you seen Rasmus? - What? I think that ugly mutt should be shot! - Did you hear what he said?! - I thought I heard a louse cough. Did you say mutt? Did you say shot? I think I know who it was! - C'mon, Rasmus! Go More! More. C'mon Rasmus! Hey! Mother, little mother, who is as well as well as you! - No, that's not it—it's "who is like you!". - Yes, yes, that's good. The main thing is you are who you are! No—have we had a daughter too? Hi there, Pricken! - What's for dinner? Sausage and mash. - Lovely. - Where's Rasmus? Something tells me he's coming now. - Hi gang! . Bless me! Who have you been playing with?! - Just playing. - Look, a hole in the trousers! And they're new trousers too. - Think I had time to go home and change? - Have you been in a fight? Watch out the police don't come and get you! - Go up and have a wash now, then we'll eat. Good day to you, Pontus. So you've been in the junkyard, have you. - I need some money. You could make good money helping to clear out my basement. I've never in my life seen so much junk in one place, eh? - Yes, Aunt Andersson, it's a bit untidy, but I'll soon clear it up. - You're a great kid, you are, Pontus! - Lucky you didn't take all the mashed potato! - Oh, sorry! - Oh please! There's plenty more on the stove! You don't have to fight over food. I love this. Sausage, mother and the kids. This is what I really enjoy! Have you had a hard time today? Catch any bad people? - Big villains! I arrested a canary! But not so much as a single safecracker! - But Dad, if there was a really big culprit, wouldn't you be scared when you're not used to it? - Afraid? Me?! Is that all you think of your father, eh? No, my boy. There isn't a double murderer that could scare me, no! - So is it just Mum you're afraid of, then? Dad, can I go to the funfair for a while? - The funfair? Well— - No, there'll be no fun fair until you've done your homework. - No, exactly right. You see, Dad always did his homework before going to the funfair when he was a kid. - Do I have to go back to the fossils' time just because I want to go to the funfair for a while? We don't have homework for tomorrow. Well that's strange. You haven't any homework at all? - No. and anyway, I've done it all. Have you done it all? - Yes. And anyway, I can do it on breakfast break. So there. So this is how it stands. You have no homework at all— and you've done it already and by the way you can do it during breakfast break! That's extremely peculiar. - And I was bragging about you to a lady in the street. "That boy, he'll go far at school!" I said. - You'd have been better saying, "He'll be going there for a long time." - Did you just do a funny? No, Mum, I can go, can't I? Just for a little while. - Well— Or have you decided in the tarent-peacher association that a boy can't never have fun? - Hi. We off then? - That's easy to say. - Oh go on then, for heaven's sake! - Thank you, darling Mother! - Mother, I'm going to the fun fair tonight too—with Joakim. - She's head over heels in love all the time, but she has new sheiks all over the place. But this time it's probably worse than usual. - May I never become like that! - No, we have to hope that we continue to be fully healthy. Afterwards I'll rehearse at Joakim's house. - What are you going to rehearse? - Our harmonica orchestra's rehearsing for the summer party, if you must know. - Oh really. I thought you'd be rehearsing, "Oh, Pricken, you're so cute! I'm crazy about you!" - Listen. Speaking of which, Pricken, it mustn't be as late as when Joakim brought you home last Saturday. - But did we wake you up, Mum? Did we make such a noise? - No, you were horribly quiet. That's what woke me up! - Dad! Can I have some pocket-money in advance? - You won't need it. I've sold some scrap metal. - Beautiful! How much did you get? - Three kronor! We're almost self-sufficient. - Now remember next time I didn't asked for any money for fun. - No. We must remember that you did not asked for any money. - Dad, at least you and I are in love with the same person. - You said a true word there. - Bye bye, gang! - Bye, scrap dealers! Dad, a few of us are coming back tonight to play the harmonica. Do you mind? - No, of course not. I'm going out, so it's fine. Is the cute little police girl coming too? Pricken, or whatever her name is. - Yeah, the cute little police girl is coming, yes. - Do you fancy her? - Fancy? That's not the right word. Yes, I'm so madly in love with her that I don't know where to go! - Yes, she's damn cute, she really is. - Yeah but it's not just that. She's so honest and real in every way. You can trust her all the time. - Then you should be happy, Joakim. I know that's what matters most to you. Being able to trust someone. - Yes. Now I'm off to meet Pricken. Skyride next? No one knows that. - Shark rides win the bird! New game, new winnings See what you look like! Grandad's old goat is a million times more handsome than you! - You can't talk! You look like someone sat on you when you were little! - In that case it must have been Pricken. - Mirror, mirror on the wall, who is the fairest of them all! - How can you be in love with someone like that? - I'll have to put in a lot of effort if it's going to work! - Oh you're so cute, Pricken! I'm just crazy about you! - Get lost, kid! - So this is where you're hiding. I thought we were going to practise at your house. - I forget everything when I see how beautiful I am. Come on, let's go. - Ladies and gentlemen! The next show starts in a few minutes! Come and see the world's greatest sword swallower Alfredo, known from all the capitals of the world! Come on, step in! But do not push, do not push! Everyone will get a seat! New show starts in a few minutes! Enter, ladies and gentlemen! - We only have 50 öre left. - And we need a krona. I would so love to see what happens when he eats a sword! Uncle! Can't we get in for half price, if we promise to only look with one eye? - He doesn't understand Swedish. - Does uncle understand Swedish? - Yes. Uncle speak Swedish very good. Understand you are a little rascal boy, jawohl, ein böser Knabe. Hurry up! New show begins! - He's lying in his teeth! What is it called in foreign language? Das war the fabric. Mr sword eater. He's not a rascal boy, he's a ganz schnell boy. - Get out of here, rascal boys, before Alfredo get furioso and eat you two instead! - We're probably a little hard to digest! Just imagine if he saw us! - Then we say we've come to give him 50 öre for the collection. Come on, let's see. Damn rascal kids! Now I will to kill you! - We just wanted to leave something for the collection. - Bastard kids! Now—now I will to— Alfredo—little Alfredo— you haven't hurt yourself, have you? - Berta, help me! Hurry up with that sausage! I'm hungry like lion! - Yes, but it takes a while with the potato! - That potato will never be cooked! Goddammit! - Calm down! - Berta! Berta, come out! Come out see who is come here! Ernst, old Ernst, have they let you out again? - Shhh! You don't have to broadcast it all over Svealand. - No, is evident. Have a seat. Sit in the front. - Have you come out through the bars? - Didn't think I was stuck there for life did you? - Have a sandwich in the meantime. - Hello! - Hello Berta! Cheerful as usual. There was a robbery the same day I left prison The paper said something about the silver thief— - Ernst! You have not so loud to speak and broadcast all over Svealand. Besides, who said I had anything to do with it? - Did I say that? - You look like you thought it. - I don't think, I know. We've been friends for two years for heaven's sake! Well, you're back to your old ways with silver and antiques— - No, not much now. No, I just swallow swords. - Was it Antikhajen who tipped you off? Were you paid well? - He pays so badly, damn, so you should never help him! Ernst, you know yourself. You come to him with a beautiful silver pot and you get 100 kronor. Then himself he sell it in his goddamn antique shop for 1,000 kronor! - Yes, but he's the one with the ideas and he's the one who knows where to get stuff. - Yes, it is correct, yes. Yes, no silver pot is in this whole country he does not know about! - Alfredo— - Yes, Ernst? - I met him yesterday. - Have you met Antikhajen? - I asked for a tip— - Did you? - Yes, I did. Right here in this town— - Something is here? One of the largest silver collections in the country! Ach, Gott! Little Alfredo, come in and eat! - Yes, eat a few more swords and maybe Uncle will be a little nicer then! ♪ Come, roll up, big and small ♪ ♪ buy a ticket for the carousel ♪ ♪ You have to see the world from above before you can be happy with it ♪ ♪ Ours is the greatest triumph ♪ ♪ ladies and gentlemen have ever seen ♪ ♪ Andersson, Lundström are here, come and spin with us, maiden pure ♪ ♪ Come on, jump on our carousel and watch the earth go round the sun ♪ ♪ come and spin with us tonight, hold on to your hats and frills and skirts ♪ ♪ for 25 öre and a song we'll you pass the time ♪ ♪ come and see our world once from a new perspective ♪ ♪ If you are happy and young, you are a prince or a king ♪ ♪ Are you shy, young willow bud?

A few more practices and we'll be in full bloom at the summer party. Joakim, you have it pretty neat here at your house, I think. - Yes, it's so lovely here. I've never seen anything like it. But you can't move for silverware. We have an ancestor in the family, who was in the Thirty Years' War, whose arms twitched whenever he came near a piece of silver. - And the best piece, the drinking jug—unbelievable! - Where's that then? - Come and see. - Isn't it gorgeous? - You're gorgeous. You know that, Pricken? - Weren't we talking about drinking jugs, not me? - I'd rather talk about you. - You pig! - Would you please arrange your rehearsals elsewhere! - What do you mean? You don't think— - I just believe what I see and that's quite good enough. Would you please go now. - Listen, Joakim. It was actually my fault. Pricken couldn't help it. I got a little confused. Don't strain yourself! -I assure you— Don't strain yourself, I said! Feel free to kiss Pricken as much as you want, but not here! I'll sell her cheap! - What are you standing there saying?! You big dromedary! Oh, good God. I wonder who is dumber—you or Jan. - I'm not quite as stupid as you think, my lovely! I would like to—I'm going crazy! Would you get out, so I can talk to this fool for a while! You're so stupid I have never seen the like! Can't you hear what I'm saying? It's turning into a fight in there, we'd better go. - Did you disagree about the drinking jug? - Come on! - I don't think the two of us have anything more to say to each other. - Don't stand there looking at me like I'm slimy! I can't help that Jan throws himself at me like a wild animal! - A girl is always responsible, don't you know that?. - Sure, it's our fault when you guys act like fully educated idiots! - Good night, Miss Persson. -Good night, Baron von Rencken. Can I have my photograph back? - I don't think so. I'd like to keep that— as a small memento. It's not enough that you've ruined my life. You've ruined this evening too! - The rumen, the reticulum, abomasum, and the true stomach. What's up with you? What are you sighing for? - I wasn't sighing. - Yes you were, this is what you did. - Can't I do that if I want to? - Of course you can. But why are you sighing? Have you got a pain somewhere? Have you got a stomach ache? - Can't you leave me alone! - Or has the sheik broken up with you? What is it, Pricken? - Can't you leave me alone! - Yes, but if you don't tell me what it is, I'll think it's something terrible, and I'd get so worried. - Forgive me. It's over between me and Joakim. - Well, at least it wasn't anything worse! There are any number of guys. And you usually change once every 15 minutes. - You're too young to understand this. You don't know how much I like Joakim. And then there's another thing too. You see, it was like this ... What's up with you? - What? - What are you sighing for? - I wasn't sighing. - Yes you were, this is what you did. - Can't I do that if I want to? - Of course you can. Have you got a pain? Have you got a pain in your stomach? - Can't you leave me alone! - Has the—has the police girl broken up with you? - You can imagine I'm going crazy thinking of him with my photo in his hideous old sales catalogue! - Yes, that mustn't happen. As if he'd dare to have my sister in his catalogue! Unfortunately, he probably doesn't care what you think. - Hi! We off to school, then? How are the abomasum and the rumen? - They're all right. They've been ruminating all morning, They should be fine, but worse things are happening. - What's the matter with her? - Love and misery— Come on, Pricken, don't be sad! Come on! You see in front of you the Rescue Corps for victims of love! We'll fix this! What have you come up with now? Don't you get involved in this! Remember that! - Calm down a few ounces! You don't understand what's best for you! Come on! - What are we going to do? - Come on! Do you mean we should sneak into Joakim's place tonight? Yes. - And nick that sales catalogue? - Yes exactly. Are you coming? - Yes, what do you think? It'll be more fun than when we fell off the water tower. I think so too. Do you have an alarm clock? - Yes. - Then set it so you don't sleep in. Because tonight's going to go with a bang! - Yup. Bye! - Bye! Yes, little Toker, you can't come with me now. You'll be allowed to stay in bed. Yeah. The dog should be allowed to do that. There you go, little dog. Wake up, Ernst! Wake up today! Ernst! Wake up, you seen the time! Sales catalogue. He would have a sales catalogue, him. Come on! Come on! Sehr wunderbar! What a beautiful cup! Herrlich! I have to look— Too bad about— - Rubbish. I thought I heard something. - No, it was nothing. - Where do you think he sleeps? - Up there. What was that? - His Dad! What about that door? - Yes, let's take a look. This is the boy's. There you see. That's how it went! You didn't expect that, did you? - We can get out here. Where are they? - Damn kids! I wish I knew what they are doing here. - But now they're gone, that's good. - Good! Pricken's not here. - Just a bunch of other magpies. - Maybe he hasn't had time to paste her in yet. Where does he keep it then, do you think? - Yes, we'll have to find that out. - I'm not going home without Pricken! Starlings like him shouldn't have my sister's photograph in their wallet. Or wherever it is he's got it. - The rescue corps for the victims of love moves out. - We're going back. Come on! Here it is. Here are all your chicks! Enjoy. I'll take Pricken with me. - Here— - "Her—the one." Isn't that nice. - Shhh! What was that? - I don't believe it! - Quick! We'll have to see where they go. Now, Berta, you will see something special! - Well, What did you get? - And on Thursday Antikhajen come here and buy everything! This time he'll pay well. He will must pay really well! - Great. - Look here, look here, Berta! Schöne things! We become wealthy! But Ernst, shame that Antikhajen will not come until Thursday! It hurts my nerves to go and wait so long. - He couldn't come earlier. - There! Verdammte kids! Now I will get hold of those rascals. I will kill them! Help! Help! Help! - What a noise in the middle of the night! - What's the matter? A little rascal that runs and wakes people up in the middle of the night! - Such a naughty boy! - Ein böser Knabe, ja! Excuse me! Verdammte rascal! I will kill you! Do not be afraid! No, come, come. Come! Come to Onkel Alfredo! Do you know what happens to kids who put their noses in where they don't belong? They just disappear, you never hear from them again! They are just gone. - There are high penalties for killing children, I can tell you! - I think parents would pay to get rid of their babies! If they're like these! - Leave him alone! Leave him alone! You mustn't be mean to my dog! - It's his own fault! What's he doing here? - I think you should shoot the verdammte animal that barks and barks! - If you touch Toker, then I don't know what I'm going to do. - So what will you do then, little sweet boy, what? - Sit down! You really like that mutt Toker or whatever his name is, huh? - Yes, I can tell you I do! - What if we have him killed for you, then? - You can't. You mustn't touch him! - That depends on you and him over there. - You've put your noses where they don't belong and messed everything up for us. So we don't know how to sort it out. - I'll make sure you don't do any more mischief. We might as well cut the throats of the little beasts—and the mutt too! - Of course you can go to the police and snitch. You can do that if you want. - Yes! You can be sure we can. And him— the police live in his house! So it wouldn't take long. - It is clear that you can go and snitch. But if you do, you'll never see that mutt again! It was a good project, Ernst! It was a Christian exchange! If you snitch, we kill mutt! If you not snitch, we not kill mutt! Gut, yes? - So if we don't say anything, do I get Toker back then? - Yes, but not now, not now. Not until Thursday! - Thursday?! - Yes. - This week? - You thought we were going to register our address here, did you? It's not that much fun here. - What are you going to do with Toker until Thursday? - I'll tell you. We're going to hide him where no human can get hold of him! And there we lock him up. And if you snitch— then the mutt will sit there and starve to death! Understood? Yes Yes. He gets neither food, and no water. He just dies. No more dog. Well, what's it going to be? - We promise not to say anything. Don't we, Rasmus? - Yes, we have to. - Good! That's good, boys, that's good. Honesty lasts the longest, my little Mutter always said. She was this big. Yes, now you can go, little snots! I not stand you any more. But you come here, you come here once a day so I keep an eye on you. Now disappear! Hurry now! - Poor little Toker— Get going now! Just go away! Disappear! - Don't cry, Rasmus. It always works out somehow. Listen. Let's lie in wait and see what they do with Toker. - Yes, that'll work. - Of course! Come on! Well, that was a fine carry-on. Where should we put the damn dog? And where are we going to put all the silver? We can't damn well leave it here. - Even if kids snitch not, police will come in morning snooping around. Always they come at the fair if anything gets lost. - Yeah, the bastards are like that. Berta, you were born here in this town. You probably know a place, Berta. - You can handle this. - Yes, we could perhaps hide the silver in my sister's basement. - Nice, that's nice, Ernst. - Your sister's basement? - Yes. - Is that such a good idea? If so, I'm going to put a big damn lead seal on the sack. - What d'you mean? We trust each other, I think. - Of course. We trust each other. - Yes Yes. But sealing is not stupid— - It should be sealed! Until Antikhajen takes the stuff. Then at least you know that no small trinket will get lost in the meantime! - Ach, Gott, ach, Gott, the little trinkets, Ernst! - The seal, I can arrange that right away. - What about Toker? Where are we going to put him so no one hears him barking? - I think I know a place. You know—I think they're heading for my house. - Yes. Come on. What if they hide Toker in your basement! Oh, if only they would. - Or they intend to nick our scrap! Filthy thieves. It looks as if they intend to hide Toker in Mrs. Andersson's basement. These boots my sister has been clamouring for so long to get back! Now there will be an end to that wailing. - Look Berta—do you think it's safe here? - Oh yes. A pair of old damn rubber boots! And I thought it was Toker. - It must have been that other lice brush who took him! - I know who's going to clean Mrs. Andersson's basement tomorrow. Do you? - I can't bear to think about tomorrow. Oh, Pontus. Where do you think Toker is? Mother, little mother, who is as well as well as you! - No, Patrik, that's not it—it's "who is like you!". - Yes, that's what I'm saying: who is like me?! What's this? Is it Mother's Day? What's this all about? - In this house, every day is Mother's Day! And today you get coffee in bed because the weather is so beautiful! - Oh, it's terrible how cheerful you are in the mornings! But honey, it is nice being married to you. - Yes. I don't understand how I did it. - What do you mean how you did it? - 18 years ago when I dragged you away to the minister— - I don't remember exactly, but you probably hypnotized me. It's probably pure selfishness that you bring me coffee in bed. Because you know how grumpy I am in the mornings before my first sip of coffee. - I don't know about grumpy, but you are a bit—unstable—or whatever it's called. - Is that so. Listen, you. Do you know if Rasmus is up yet? - No, there's no bang-bang or anything. But I'll have a look ... who is like you! What on earth? Are you still in bed?! Rasmus, you're late! Get up! Get up! Rasmus—! Rasmus, up! Gullan, Gullan, come here! Rasmus is dead! - No, don't talk like that! - Kids really can sleep, can't they! He's been sleeping since eight o'clock last night! - Little Rasmus, you have to wake up now, understand? - What day is it today? - It's Tuesday. - This week? - No, last week. Up you get! Isn't Toker here either? In Pricken's— - Get dressed now! Have you seen Toker? No? Then he's gone. We'd best report it to the police. Always something new. Yesterday a canary— Kurre, come on! Where are you? Kurre— What are you doing? Kurre—Kurre, come on then— Oh, Kurre, you're so cute! Kurre! Yes, but now I have to go to school. Such a shame you can't come with me. ♪ Eksjö town on Ränneslätt where every girl swings lightly ♪ ♪ haddarralan-li. had-had-had-da ♪ No, what's this? Is it the local branch of the Dolts National Confederation or what? Are you worried about Toker? Relax! Västanvik's police force is on high alert! He's almost caught already! He'll be here in a moment. Patrik, the chief inspector on the phone for you. - At this time? Keep an eye on the toaster! Hello! You're awake already and not crying? What? What in God's name are you saying?! Yes, I'll be there like a rocket! The bread's probably almost ready now. There's been a burglary at von Rencken's. All the silver's gone! What? God save the king.

Now you can go and sit down. Have you given Pricken the photo? - Are you crazy! I can't very well do that. If anyone finds out we were in that house last night, we'll be arrested! Although she'd probably be happy if she could see this! Hey, Pricken! Hey, Pricken! Hey, Pricken! Sorry. I dropped the ball. I hope I hurt you. - Well I'm used to that. At least it's better when it's just my head you're trying to crush. - Joakim. I want my photo back. It's shameful of you not to let me have it. - As you wish then. Strange, it's not here. - It's probably not so strange. You are so mean! I think know where the photo is. - Try to understand what I'm saying now. No matter what you do, no matter how much you let me down— I could never put you in that goddamn sales catalogue. Don't you understand that? - Was he nasty to you? - No, more like me being nasty to him, I'm afraid. You can't throw balls at people's heads— But oh, it felt so good! - Pricken? Can you tell Mum I'll be home a little later for dinner today. Pontus and I have something to deal with. Bye! - Bye! No, little boys. Do not look so grumpy! Little boys should be happy, said my mother always! God in heaven, how she beated me when I didn't want to be happy! - I'm sure Uncle would be this happy if Uncle had lost his dog. - Uncle this, Uncle that! Kiss mein arsch! But shouldn't we use first names now that we have so much business together! Well? - I wouldn't want to say Alfredo to a thief! - So you think it's better to say Uncle, you fool? Cheers! Bottom up! My name is Alfredo. What's your name, then? Silly little boys. - Rasmus. - Pontus. - Rasmys and Pontys! That's crazy! But Rasmys and Pontys be good boys. Nice boys. Reliable boys— Not those little silly boys running around telling, eh? Sehr sehr reliable! - Alfredo, does Toker have any food? - Ach Gott. He is knee-deep in minced meat! And he has the whole bucket of water. - Is that really true? - Yes. You think Alfredo stands here lying to you? No. "Always stick to the truth", my mother always used to say. "You should lie to only the police!" "As hard as you can," she said. - The police! Oh dear, I'm so afraid! - Ach Gott, there come two of them! - Damn kids. Did you snitch after all? - Certainly not. We haven't said a single word! - You can be sure we haven't said a word! Good day. - Ach how nice to visit the simple hut of the sword swallower! - Sorry. We just want to look in the carriage for a moment. - Oh yes. In the middle of the bright afternoon. What happiness! Shall I ask Berta to turn on the coffee kettle? - We are from the police. - I suspected it. I knew it when I looked at your beautiful uniforms. I said to myself: "Alfredo—these aren't two ordinary idiots. They're police!" Two police in the simple hut of the sword swallower. - What are you doing here?! - It is just two little nice boys who like to talk to a simple sword swallower— - Who told you you could run to the fairground every single day! You go home now! - But Dad— - Yes, yes, yes, yes. - Poor little boy! Do you have a father who is a police officer? Yes, some people get it so bad that you can start crying! - Get out of here now! And not a sound from you! Get going! So! ♪ Dreams of silver, dreams of gold ♪ ♪ cop he's snooping behind my pan ♪ Yes, but he doesn't seem to find anything. Sorry to disturb you. - No trouble. Look in some other time. - The ten goes on the nine there. - Have you come here at full gallop to talk about that? - You cheated there! - Don't tell me about it. I did it so cunningly I didn't notice it myself. Does the constable know what resemblance there is between you and my solitaire? - No, I don't know. - Neither of you go out. - Is that supposed to be a hint? I'm going out anyway. ♪ Dreams ... Wait. Do we dare go into the basement? What if someone comes? - I promised to clean for Aunt Andersson. - Yes, but I don't think Alfredo wants cleaning help right now. - No, he's probably sitting drinking coffee with your Dad right now. Come on! - Good afternoon. - Well, did you find anything? - No, it was a purely routine examination. -Yes. I also usually do routine examinations— —without finding anything. - What do you mean? - I mean, for example, the collar button you lose under the dresser—annoying, yes. Yes, but joking apart, we all have our routine jobs. I swallow swords in all simplicity. Yes, yes. - Yes. Goodbye. - Wouldn't it be great to be able to look inside! - Yes, but wasn't it silly of him to seal the sack! - Yes—but wait, I have an idea. You can cut open the sack at the bottom, and take everything out. If you sew it together properly, no-one will notice. Yes! That's what we'll do! You're right! I'll rush home to Mum and borrow a needle, thread and scissors! Bye! - Are you nervous, Ernst? - Yes! I'd like to see where you hid that sack. - Yes, but then we can go there together, then you see for yourself. Then will you calm your nerves, my poor Ernst. I will change. Moment. - Hurry up then! - Yes! - Imagine if you had all this! Then you'd be a millionaire! Well, almost. But poor Joakim's father anyway! - Yes. - We'd better put this back. - Yes, that's probably best. I have an idea! You know, Ernst. When I grow old, then I will retire, then I will no more swallow swords. I will not swallow so much as a small butter knife! And when I will eat, I will eat only with a spoon. - Put that flower away! We're in a hurry! Too bad you only got an F in needlework! Is that something called blanket stitch? - No, I think I remember it's called stem stitch. But I'm not really certain. Amalgamated Scrap Company Limited. In this country can call a company anything! Oh yes. Rasmys and Pontys—ach. It is only the little stupid boys! Come on! This is how it was, yes? - Yes. - Ernst. You are welcome. This way. - Quick! They're coming! - Come on! Come in, Ernst. Come in. Ach Gott. What Antikhajen will have tomorrow to pay for this! - Yes. You can see the sealing is well done. They haven't been able to get even a small box. When you know what you are doing. If only it were tomorrow night now! - But it will be tomorrow. Don't be so impatient, Ernst. Sei ruhig. Tomorrow night. It will be soon, ja? Then we'll sort out the boys and the mutt, ja? This is what I thought. Come, come, you will hear. This is what I thought— So here is von Rencken's house, and here is where the thief got in! No, now you're going crazy anyway. There hasn't been a thief here, no! - Not here, but at von Rencken's. - Yes, but then you have to say that. - Yes, yes. So he probably went like this— sneaked in— - Was he sleepwalking? - Don't disturb me when I'm doing criminal investigations! I have a theory you know. Yes, I do. - I have a theory, too. I have a theory that this has stuck in your brain, Patrik. You don't understand what this means to me, do you? Can you imagine: the Stockholm police have been looking for this silver thief for a whole year now! I think it's the same man. Imagine if we could arrest him right here in Västanvik! Theoretically, it's not impossible! - Theoretically, you can catch eels with a lasso. - Dad. Would you be very happy if you could catch that silver thief? - Yes I would. But do you think Mum understands that? No. She doesn't understand that you have to think in order to get results! - Well then, I certainly understand that. As long as you don't sit here and think until the silver thief is 100 miles from here! It would be better if you could go out and catch him, I think. - Sure. With a lasso, wasn't that what you said?! - No, I didn't say that. I don't think you'll get him by sitting here with your eyes closed either! And by the way, I'm so worried about Toker I might die. He's been gone since Tuesday, and now it's Thursday. But you don't care one bit about that. - Oh yes, of course I do. I really care about that! But the police do have other things to do than run around looking for canaries and dogs. - I think I'll go and look for Toker, Mother. Don't worry, I have a feeling I'll find him. - Yes, off you go, my little boy. Then he said: "Do you know what I dreamed last night, Annika? I dreamed I kissed you,” he said. - What did you say? - You get your best ideas when you sleep! I'm sure you sleep too! - Well, I'm not sleeping, I'm dying. - Are you dying?! - It'll be nice when I have finished dying. Then maybe at last I won't be always thinking about Joakim. - Joakim Joakim Joakim! When we practise tomorrow night, give him a good telling-off and then you'll be good friends again. - You don't imagine me ever setting foot in that house again! - What do you mean? Aren't you going to practise?! Don't you realise the summer party's on Saturday! - I'm not going to any summer party. - Listen now, Pricken Persson. You simply can't do that. Don't you understand you're ruining it for the rest of us! - And don't you understand that you can't play the guitar with a broken heart. - I don't care about your broken heart. Play with your fingers, same as I do! - Well all right. I will play, I will go to the party, but I'm not going to enjoy myself. Yes, yes, yes. You're going to get that mutt! - But where is he? - Tell them, Berta. I can't take this. - Do you know where Ängsstugan is? - Yes, it's that abandoned house out towards Björka. - Right. Do you know where it is? - Yes. - Yes. - There's an attic room at the top. That's where you'll find the mutt. - He's not a mutt. Come on, Pontus, let's run! - Come back! Not a word later about this either, or else I'll make hotchpotch of that Toker! - Let go of Rasmus or I'll punch you, you filthy thief! - Don't be so cocky. You don't have the mutt yet! - No, but it won't be long. - It's so quiet. What if he's dead anyway! - Open the door! He's not here! - No, he is certainly not here, but here is Alfredo instead. And it's almost more fun. - Where's Toker? - You scream so to my little ears almost hurt. - I want Toker back! - You promised that, you low thief! - No, what for such ugly words! I know that I have promised you that you will get back the mutt— - Don't call him a mutt! His name is Toker. -Where is he? I want him back! - Yes, and you shall have him back. But not until tomorrow. - Why not until tomorrow? - Yes. Now I come to something very sad. It is like my old heart wants to break, but it can nott be helped. I must the two of you to lock in this nice little room overnight. - That's the dirtiest trick! - No. Just a little precaution. Tomorrow morning when we are far far away, Berta's sister will come and open the door. And then you go to the stable, unlock it, open the door and there the mutt is! The dog. Toker. - Dammit, you're rotten. You break your promises! - You must not hit old Alfredo! He keep his promise! Alfredo always keep his promises, but the timing can vary a little. You must not be mad on old Alfredo. I am a true child friend, yes. Certainly. Here you will see. I do not want you to starve to death. Moment. Here you will see what you will get—you two little sweet boys! That you can sit and munch on. Nice cream cake. Have your old cream cake! It's Toker I want! - Yes, but was not a shame about the nice cream cake. But how wonderful it was! The best cream cake! Taste, what—it was wonderful. Here will you get— here will you get—here will you get the key to the stable. As promised. Alfredo rewards always evil with good! Eat cake all evening. But if I meet you again in my life, I will beat you yellow and blue! My silly little boy! My mother will go absolutely crazy if I don't come home tonight. - Yes, and I'll go crazy too if I have to sit here until tomorrow morning! Do—do you think we dare jump? - No, my mother will be even more crazy if I come home and I've killed myself. Jumping won't work. But—there are other ways. - What are you trying to do? - Open the door. Beautiful! Where did you learn that? - I've been able to do that since craft class! Pontus! What if Toker isn't there! I'd die! - Just hurry up and open it! - Little Toker! You're alive! I've missed you so much! I'm so glad you're alive! Little Toker! Yes— - And here he's been living on bread and water. Poor thing! - I like you so much! - Come on! We have to hurry up now! - Yes of course! - Yes, now we have to run, Toker. Dad's on duty tonight, luckily. Come on, Toker. - My theory is—the thieves are getting in there! - Hold everything, Dad, you have to hear this! - Yes, yes. Don't disturb me when I'm doing criminal investigations! The thieves are getting in there! - They certainly are not. Listen, dad. You see— Here: I can feel that drinking jug. The finest catch of all! Oh, Ernst, I am happy like a little child on Christmas Eve! - Yes, it's actually the best job we've ever done. - Open it. - Yes. I am opening it—Look here what has Ernst done! He is a real fox, I must say! He has sealed the sack so that no small trinket could escape. - Yes, but now it has to be broken. - Broke, yes. Where have you— I am very excited! Schnell, Ernst. So we get to show him everything. You have no idea how much goodies we have in this sack! No, no, Ernst. Now let me get the drinking jug out first. I know exactly where I have it! Yes, here. Here I have it! Who wants the first Christmas present? - What's that? - Are you taking the piss? Amalg— Amalgamated Scrap Company Limited! Du Ernst. It's them verdammten kids! But now they will be killed! What kind of morons are you, really, to let yourselves be tricked by children. - Talk to me not now, not talk to me. I am broken man! - Don't worry. I'll definitely get them to tell me where they've hidden the silver! Good thing you locked the kids in, isn't it. - I'll wait one hour. Not a second longer. If the silver isn't here by then, I'm going. Is that understood? - No. Talk to me not now, not now! But only wait until I get hold of those little serpents! Just wait! Just wait! Now comes the big bang! - Don't touch! You'll split your bodice! - Hold me, Ernst, hold me, or I will kill them! The door lock and leave them to dead! - Leave this to me. - You have two seconds to tell me where the silver is. - Yes. It's in Sala silver mine and everywhere. - So. Do you want me to kill your dog? - No! You can't do that. We'll tell you where we hid it. - Well where is it then? - It's in a place in town. - What place, stupid boy? - We can show you. - That is good. But first little boys must thank me. You must thank me. - Why? - Because I did not kill you. - It is pitiful. I am but no Herod. - Thank you, kind Alfredo! - What is all this! - Oh yes, oyesoyes! You, wait a moment, come here. Give me the stable key! Don't forget your dog is locked up in the pig pen inside the stable. If you come up with more rascal tricks like this, your dog is finished! - Then have you only a little dead dog! That is all. - Adieu, little dead dog! - Quiet! - Sorry. Not so fast! Not so fast! My heart! My heart! This is where it is. We'll go in and get it while you stay here and wait, all right? - You thought you could fool us like that? That we'd stand here and wait while you sneak out another way? Boy, I've been in this business for twenty years. You don't fool me! - No, not to mention me. My old mother has taught me that one when I at kindergarten started. - Yes, hurry up now! - All right, if you're so stubborn, fine. Come on then. - One moment first, you little rascal boy. Can you swear that the silver is in there? - Yes, of course I can! - Yes, but do it, then! - The silver is in there, or strike me dead! - Ja, then so. Here is it dark like in the land of Egypt. - There you are. In you go! - Ach, ach mein lieber Gott! Gott! No no. Welcome! Why did you come in the back door? Yes, most welcome! - Yes, you are most welcome! - I was right, wasn't I? We fooled you. - There was a lot your mother forgot to teach you on that first day at kindergarten. - Yes, she forgot a lot, yes. Yes Yes. Ah, the dear old cuffs! Ernst, why suddenly have you become so quiet? - Keep your mouth shut! - Ach ja. Maybe will it fun to see dear old Långholmen again. - Yes, you shouldn't have too long to wait for that pleasure. You've done well, boys. I must say I'm impressed. - Yes, you have done it very well, but— Herod wasn't that stupid either if you think about it. - I can't believe you're so clever! Yes. Your boy's a true credit to you, Patrik. - Yes, he takes after his father. Pontus isn't that stupid, either. Although he doesn't take after me. Yes. You should all get a reward for this. - Yes, I expect the insurance company will probably take care of that. - That's clear, chief inspector. But can't a proud father also come up with something? How about ice cream during the whole summer party? - Lock them up. - Ach ja! Life is strange. Some go to summer party, some go to jail. - Yes, but that all depends a little on how you behave, doesn't it. - Ach ja, you are so wise. You are so clever, both of you, rascal boys! You should have a spanking! Good luck at the summer party, but first you have to comb your hair, huh?. You'll have to put on your flannel suit if you're going to the summer party. - Do I have to wear formal clothes? I might as well stay at home! - Yes, as you wish. Stay at home, then! - Then I've combed my hair for nothing! Look, how happy he is about his feet! - Oh, he's so happy about his feet. In that case it's best that you get to be just as happy about your whole body, then! - Do you want me to go naked?! - No. How would that look! I mean it's best that you can go dressed however you want. Because apparently it's so significant. Great! Come on, let's go. - Oh don't you look so cute! Are you happy about your feet, Pricken? - You ask such strange things sometimes, Mum. - I'm not one bit happy. - Yes, but you have to be when you go to a summer party. What is it, Pricken? Is it Joakim? I wouldn't go at all if I didn't have to play in the orchestra! Poor little thing! Are you ready, Patrik? - Yes yes. - Hurry up. We have to go now! - Yes, I'm coming. - Patrik. Is my hat on straight? - Yes, it's on perfectly straight. - But it shouldn't be. It should sit crooked! - No, come on now, come on! - Are you happy about your feet, Patrik? - Yes, as you can see. From my feet up to my eyebrows. - Who is as well as you, Patrik! But I want Pricken to be happy too. Right up to the eyebrows. I dreamed about you last night, Annika. - Did you? What did you dream about me? - I dreamed that you and I were out walking in the middle of the night. There was moonlight— - Was there moonlight? What happened then? - We came to a gate, but it was closed. And so we stood by the gate in the moonlight— - We stood there in the moonlight— What did we do then? - Do? What do you think? - Tell me what we did! - We climbed over, of course! What else would we do? - Was that all you dreamed?! - No! Certainly not. - Stay here! I'll fix it! - Ugh! Big Chief do it! Joakim, is what's written here true? - What? - Yes. Haven't you known all along? - Joakim— - Come with me! - What else did you dream? - We came to a new gate— - Was that closed too? - Yes! We had to climb over that one too. Where are you going? - I'm off before you get to the next gate! And I hope you fall flat on your face when you climb over it! Idiot! My little Toker, you know you can't run away from home without permission! My little Toker. You're so sweet! - You like Toker so much! - I like him so, so much! And you too of course— and then ice cream! - The rescue corps for victims of love. I think we've earned ourselves an ice cream. Look over there! Don't you ever get like that! - No—we never will. Which is good. English subtitles by faxeholm1234 and jeremys TNT 2023
