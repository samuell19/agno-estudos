It's Ferris. It's Ferris. Get outta here! (alarm sounding) (intense dramatic music) (buttons beeping) - [Ramsey] Dr. Erhardt, how disappointing of you. Find him and kill him. (intense dramatic music) (Stanley grunting) (intense dramatic music) (Stanley panting) (dart gun firing) (Stanley grunting) (soft dramatic music) (soft dramatic music) (intense dramatic music) (intense rock music) (upbeat rock music) (intense rock music) - All right, everybody check in. - Hallway's clear. - Anybody got a 12-letter word for superior and numbers or strength? - Put it away, McAllister, or you'll be doing the graveyard shift at Walmart. - Yeah, yeah. Stairways clear. - [Rasheed] Conway, get down here. - South side elevators clear. (card reader beeps) - You called? - This is Mr. Conway. He's supposed to be the best. Say hello to Mr. Conway. - Hello, Mr. Conway. It's nice to meet you. - That's enough! Beautiful, isn't she? Bought and paid for, just like you. Is everything locked down, Mr. Conway? - The area is secure. - Good. Good. - If there'll be nothing more, sir. - Get out of here, Conway. (footsteps approaching) - Hmm? What's up? (Ken sighs) (alarm beeps) - Wait, wait, wait. Hold on. Put it away. How stupid can you be? (chuckles) Hold your positions. I'll handle it from here. Get my bag. (chuckles) I can't believe this guy. Ah-ah. (soft suspenseful music) - You gotta be kidding me. - Why not? The element of surprise is always the best strategy. Ah, take care of my jacket. (soft suspenseful music) (intense dramatic music) (rope creaking) Now isn't this called trespassing? (men rustling) (men grunting) - Get him, Conway! - Ah-ah! Ah! - Who sent you? - No one! Ah! - Now, who sent you? - He raped and killed my wife! (gun firing) No! (intense dramatic music) - He was telling the truth, wasn't he? - He was a fanatic. - You asshole. He was telling the truth. - He was a liar. He was trying to kill me, and I shot him in self-defense. - Find someone else. I quit. - You can't quit! You're bound to me by contact for the next six months. - Watch me. (punch smacking) (knife flicks) (knife thuds) - Ah! - I'm fascinated by this sudden concern for morality. You realize that you can't get away with this. The guards won't allow it. After all, you taught them everything they know. You try to escape, the guards will kill you. - I'm not that easy to kill. - Conway has reneged on his contract. Kill him. (Ken grunts) (punch smacking) (bones crack) (guard screams) (vase shatters) (punches smacking) (guard grunts) (kick thuds) (kick thuds) (guns cocking) (soft suspenseful music) - You don't want this, do you? Say when. - I saw that movie. I'm not afraid of you. (gun clatters) (clip clatters) (punches smacking) (guard grunts) (kicks thuds) (guard grunts) - You sure ain't no daisy. ♪ I've got that sinking feeling ♪ ♪ I know I'm going down ♪ ♪ I've got that sinking feeling ♪ ♪ I know I won't be found ♪ Woo-boo-boo-boo-boo. (buttons beeping) (gate clanging) (buttons beeping) Aw, Jesus. He changes the code every week. (buttons beeping) Yes! (doors clattering) All somebody has to do is jump over the fence. (soft Asian music) (Ken grunting and breathing) You know, I've got highlights of the police report here. We got, uh, two broken noses, three slight concussions, seven broken ribs, a knife wound to a right arm. You know, and one very pissed off employer. (Ken sighs) - I'm tired of working for assholes. - Do you know everyone that hires you is bound to be an asshole? That's the nature of the business. - Hutch, he shot a guy right outta my hands. - Yeah? Show me the body. (Ken sighs) - Move to your left a little bit. - What? - Just move to your left a little bit, please. (punching bag whooshes) - Whoa! Ken! You got a bunch of big offers on the table. Will you take one, please? And do me a favor and try not to be such a pain in the ass. - All right. (punches thudding) What do we got? - Okay. Okay, number one. Alfonso Daklama. - Daklama? - [Hutch] Now he's willing to pay 200,000 up front. (punches thudding) - The guy endorses child slavery. He runs a children's army down in Mozambique. - I, I hear he's a reformed man. - [Ken] Next. - Okay, all right, all right. How's this? The Red Cross. $400,000, two month's work, escorting supplies through Sri Lanka. - Sri Lanka? (Ken grunts) (punch thuds) And come down with some jungle virus? No way. When I go, I'll be jumping off a cliff, not rotting in some hospital bed. (Ken grunts) (punch thuds) - Ken, Ken, we gotta talk about this. Ken. Ken, we have a serious problem here. - I just realized that. - You did? - Yep. We're out of bananas again. - No, no, no, no, no. Really, a serious problem. - This is serious. - Listen to me for just a second. You know, you've got to work to pay for this lifestyle. - Yeah, yeah. What are we gonna do about the bananas? - Forget the bananas. Forget the apples and the coconuts. Will you focus on one of these offers? - Hutch, I just finished a job, lighten up. - Rasheed is not gonna pay you. I mean, do you blame him? (blender whirring) - Sorry, no bananas. What are you telling me, Hutch? - I'm telling you that these little stunts you pull, they cost you. Couldn't you wait until after payday? - You got my mail? - Yeah. Yes, I do. I've got your mail. You know, you don't listen to a word I say, do ya? - Hmm? Junk, junk, junk, junk. - Nobody's saying you're not great at what you do, but until you see one of these assignments through to the end, there's not much I can do for ya. Now, now these are legitimate offers. Real money. Sri Lanka. Just, just say the word. - I got a job offer. - Great. From who? - Marisa. - Marisa? Marisa? What? She sends you a letter? - She wants to have dinner with me tonight. - Oh, no, no, no, no, Ken. That is one can of worms you do not wanna open right now in your life. Listen, listen. I know I'm just your accountant, but I am advising you not to go. - Thanks, Hutch. - Shall we sit? - Okay. - I was hoping my letter would reach you in time. - Well, considering you hand delivered it, I think the odds were in your favor. Um. What do you want, Marisa? - I wanna hire you. Please? - You're looking good. Last few years haven't aged you a bit. - You haven't changed. - No, I think I have. But then how would you know? You ran out. - Look, that's history. Can we not talk about the past, please? - Yeah, let's just brush it aside like it never happened. - Please, Ken. - Fine. What's the job? - This is Dr. Gregory Erhardt. He's the leading virologist. And this is the man he works for, Dr. Ramsey Krago, head of- - Krago Industries, right. Post a net worth of what, 4.5 billion last fiscal year? And was disqualified from the 1987 Nobel Prize for physiology and medicine. - That's right. - So how long were you dating this Erhardt before he disappeared? (Marisa chuckles) - He's just a friend. - A friend? So why all the concern? - Well, he's missing, Conway. Anyway, what do you care? - I don't. - Why ask? - I just need to know all the facts. - He's a close friend. - How close? - [Marisa] What's that got to do with anything? - I need to know all the details for the case. - Look, he's been working for Krago Industries, and I haven't heard from him in over two weeks. - So he's the kind of friend that you would hear from once every two weeks? - [Marisa] Yeah. - Every week? - Yeah. - Every day? - Yeah. No, I. - Shall we order? You look a little flushed. I'll have the lobster. What would you like? - I'll have a salad, please. - Did you ever stop to think that you were overreacting just a little? - What do you mean? - I mean this Egghardt. - Erhardt. - Yeah, yeah, was too busy to call. Maybe his letters got lost in the mail. - I don't think so. - Wait, here's a theory. Maybe, just maybe he decided to vanish out of your life forever. Just like that. I know you know that one, right? - [Marisa] Ken, I can't work with you like this. - Relax. You're not going to. - What? - Hire a private detective. You don't need me. Here you go. - Ken, I have never asked you for anything. Do you think this is easy for me? (engine starts) I need you, Ken. Please? - The most recent specimen of which was detected last October. It was originally believed to be an outbreak of the Ebola virus, which as we all know, recently resurfaced in Zaire after a 16-year hiatus. However, this new virus is far more potent than Ebola. It is called Ferris. Working its way down river in the Varunga Mountains on the Rwandan border, it killed 67 people in 48 hours. It has a mortality rate of 97%. - [Receptionist] Hi. - Hi. - Hi. Dr. Krago's lecture's nearly over, Dr. Tully, but here's a copy of his lecture notes and a tape. - Great, thank you. - [Receptionist] Thank you. - My friends, my colleagues. It has been predicted and not unreasonably a virus like Ferris could enter high population areas and devastate global populations where casualties would not be measured in thousands, or even measured in tens of thousands, but where casualties would be measured in tens of millions. We have to ask ourselves, do we wanna see our friends? Do we wanna see our families? Indeed, do we want to see our children victimized by a virus the likes of Ferris? The answer is obvious. The solution is imperative. Lobby. Lobby for the research funds to find a vaccine to cut down this killer before it reaches American shores. Thank you very much. (audience applauding) - Sounds interesting. Sorry I missed it. (crowd murmuring) An honor to meet you in person. - Dr. Tully. - Yes, I was wondering if you could repeat your lecture up in my state. I run a lab in Medford, Oregon. - I'm afraid I have rather a full schedule, but some other time, perhaps. - Dr. Krago, one last thing. I'm looking for a friend of mine, a colleague, Dr. Erhardt. Stanley Erhardt. You haven't seen him, have you? - (sighs) Erhardt. - [Ken] Last I heard he was working for you. - We're running a little late. - Well, I have an awful lot of people in my employ. Good day, Dr. Tully. - Well, you'd remember this guy. He's one of the best. - Well, I'm sure that's probably why I hired him. - Dr. Erhardt's not attending the conference this year. - Dr. Krago, if you see him, can you have him drop me in line sometime? - Where did you say your lab was? - Medford, Oregon. - Well, if I see Dr. Erhardt, I'll be sure to give him your regards, Dr. Tully. If I'm not mistaken, I seem to remember hearing that he was very busy working on the Varicella Zoster vaccine. You're familiar with that, of course? - I should. I had it for two weeks when I was 12, except my mother called it the chickenpox. I hope his efforts weren't in vain, Dr. Krago. - Meaning? - Mercer and Company just released a vaccine for chickenpox called Varivax. The FDA feels it's 90% effective, but you already knew that. - I'm very well aware of the existence of Varivax, Dr. Tully. It's my business to be aware. - Does that mean Erhardt doesn't work for you any longer? - I never did say he worked for me, Dr. Tully, but if he did, I'm sure you would respect our need for confidentiality. Nice meeting you, Dr. Tully. - Asshole. - Well, well, well. I wonder who this could be. (camera zoom whirring) - Dr. S. Tully. - I mean, he sure seemed a little too eager to talk to our Dr. Krago. - Yeah, well. Maybe he's just a fan. - Yeah. Maybe. All right, pack it up. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold on. Gimme my binoculars. - [Leo] What's up? - Grab your camera. Our Dr. Tully has a friend. You should shoot some of this just in case he's a player. - You got it. (camera clicking) - Move over. Come on. Come on, come on. - This is way beyond my job description. I'm an accountant. - I wonder what this guy's up to. - Should we tail him? - No. But get on the computer. Check him out. - Why can't you drive your own car? - I need your car for a cover. How many virologists do you know drive Vipers? - None. But for that matter, I don't know any virologists. Now, I told you not to take this job. There's no money in it. I told you to take the Sri Lanka job, but you said no. Dr. Tully? You know my first girlfriend's name was Tully. Tammy Tully. God, she had big boobs. (Ken chuckles) - Hutch, just keep your eye on the limo. - Can I keep this? - Yeah. - I picked up some food at Taco Tourista. - Oh, Hutch. Not that place again. It's a Mexican fast food joint that sells French fries. Get the clue. - I'm sorry. It's the best I could do. Planet Hollywood doesn't have drive-thru. - Not yet. - Three o'clock at UCLA. I'd like you to keep your speech down to one hour. - Why do you do this to me? - It'll look good. World-renowned virologist sharing his vast knowledge with the scientists of tomorrow. Ah-ah-ah! You have a lecture to give. I'll not have you smelling like a drunk. (Ramsey sighs) (window whirring) - At least allow me some of my other simple pleasures. (Sloane chuckles) - Dammit! The guy didn't gimme any hot sauce. I specifically asked for hot sauce and he didn't give it to me. How am I supposed to eat my burrito without hot sauce? - Hutch, look at it this way. They're probably doing your stomach a favor. I wonder what they're up to. - He's a famous virologist, for Christ's sakes. He's doing what virologists do. He's probably working on the cure for some horrible disease. - Ramsey. Ramsey, Ramsey, settle down. We have to do this! All right. At five o'clock, the Santa Monica Children's Hospital is honoring you for your generous donation. - One good tax write off deserves another. - I'm sure they'd like to think it was a genuine donation. (Ramsey sighs) - Whatever you say. Is that all the business? - That's it. - [Ramsey] Mmm. (Sloane laughs) - Oh, great. One ketchup! One ketchup and you've got it. (phone ringing) (Sloane grunting) - What? The driver says we're being followed. Dr. Tully and a friend. - So you like to play games, eh, Dr. Tully? We'll see how you're like this one. Moses. - Goddammit, he's on the run. (engine revving) (tires screeching) (car jostling) - Hey, slow down, man! This is my wife's car! (car jostling) (engine revving) (tires screeching) - Looks like we got company. Just a scientist, huh? Who are these guys behind us? (tires screeching) (engines rumbling) (tires screeching) Looks like they're trying to box us in. - Ah! - I don't think they're trying to box us in! (guns firing) - Ah! Ah! (gun firing) Ah, shit! - Show time! (gun firing) (shooter grunting) (driver laughs) - Screw you! - Screw me? Eat this. Your door's open, asshole. (gun firing) (head thuds) (horn honking) (cars thudding) - Slow down! - I can't! We're locked up! (metal creaking) - Jesus Christ! - This is not the time, Hutch! (gun firing) (gun clicking) - How many bullets you got left? - One more clip. - Oh, we're dead! My wife's gonna kill me! (gun firing) (pin ticking) Is that a grenade? - Shit! Throw it out! - I got it! I got it! (grenade clatters) Uh-oh. (gun firing) - What? - Get down! (explosion booming) (glass shattering) (metal grinding) - What the hell was that? - It was a hand grenade! - I thought you threw it out! - I did! Hey, don't yell at me! I'm not a superhero! (flames crackling) (truck rumbling) - Hutch! Hutch! - Oh, shit! We're not gonna fit! I told you not to take this job! What are you gonna do? - Go faster. - What? No! No, no, no! - It will be all right, trust me! Just get down, now! (metal squeaking) (vehicles crashing) (explosion booming) (glass shattering) - Ah! Woo! Yeah! - We made it! - We made it! (explosion booming) Oh, shit! We made it. (explosion booming) - Oh! - I don't think your wife's car did, though. - Oh, Margie's gonna be pissed. - Hi. - [Ken] I can't believe it. - What happened to you? - Your Dr. Krago just tried to have me killed. - What? - Am I interrupting anything here? - No, no. Just let me get dressed. Are you sure it was Dr. Krago? - I'm positive. Would I lie to you? Don't answer that. - [Marisa] What happened? - I talked to Krago. - So what'd he say? - [Ken] Hello. - [Marisa] He said what? - (coughs) He said he'd have to get back to me on Erhardt. So we followed him and he picked up our tail. We wrecked the car. - Oh, no. Not your Viper. - Oh, no, no, thank god. No. It was Hutch's wife's car. I hate to be in his shoes right now explaining the damage. - [Margie] Look at my car! And don't you lie to me, Stanley Hutchinson! I wanna know the truth and right now! - Do you want a drink or something? - Sure. You have a beer? - Yeah. Here you go. - Thanks. (wine pouring) - So tell me the real story behind Erhardt and Krago Industries. - Krago recruited Erhardt from our company for a three-month trial period. We kept Erhardt on salary with the premise that he would receive a major bonus at the end of his three months with Krago. So therefore, he'd be bringing Krago expertise into our company. - Wait a minute, isn't that called industrial espionage? - Theoretically, it's all legal. You see, Erhardt was supposed to report back to me at the end of three months, but then he disappeared completely. You see, every time a new virus crops up, there's a race to see who can develop the vaccine first, and therefore reap all the profits. Krago's vaccine always seems to be the first on the market. - Yeah, I read about that. - Well, a lot of the other companies like ours say something fishy is going on. - Maybe he just hires the best people. - He does. - So? - Manufacturing the vaccine takes time. Preparing the distribution takes time. It's almost as if Krago knows the genetic structure of the virus before it even breaks out. - Maybe he does. - What do you mean? - Well, maybe he's developing a virus and a vaccine at the same time, and then he releases the virus into the environment and sells the vaccine to the highest bidder. - Well, that would explain why he's always one step ahead of the other companies. But come on, that's premeditated murder. - Yeah, it is. (soft dramatic music) (knuckles rapping) - Ramsey. I didn't expect to see you until the meeting tomorrow. - Myles, yes. Well. Can I come in? - Sure, sure. - I wanted to talk to you about tomorrow's board members vote, Myles. - Yes, well, I- - Now I realize that you are still opposed to the added funding that I require for my new research and development team, and well, you must be aware that I need a unanimous vote in order to acquire the funding from the board members at tomorrow's meeting. And, well, you are the only person who remains unconvinced. - Yes, well, I am aware of the situation, but I don't feel that this is the right time for us to be discussing the issues. - And I totally agree with you, Myles. In fact, the only reason that I'm here tonight is to assure you that regardless of which way you vote tomorrow, there will be no hard feelings between us. - Well, thank you, Ramsey. I'm relieved to hear that. Thank you very much. - You have a good night's sleep, Myles. - You, too, Ramsey. (soft sinister music) - A good night's sleep. - I will, yes. (soft suspenseful music) - I'm sure you will. - Ferris? - No. Ferris must be saved for someone special. No, Myles just received a little bite of Notechis scutatus. - [Sloane] Ah. - [Rasheed] Tiger snake. (soft suspenseful music) (Myles groaning) (Myles gasping) - Dissolves completely, leaves no trace. (Myles gasping) Heart attack of the night. Poor fella. - Here's to a unanimous vote. (Myles gasping) (footsteps approaching) - He's checked in until tomorrow. Penthouse suite. He's expected back in about an hour. - I don't know about this. This is breaking and entering. Are you sure this is necessary? - I'll tell you when I get back. Keep an eye on it. - Be careful. - Okay. (soft dramatic music) (gun cocking) (soft suspenseful music) - Of all the maggot-eating scum of the earth I gotta replace, it's you. - Conway, how you doin', man? Geez. Good seeing you. - Great, Billy. How's the wife? - Oh, man. Not too good. She got real sick, but Dr. Krago is taking care of her on the island. - Isn't the boss something? - Yeah, he is, man. So you working this gig? - Hey, isn't everyone? - (laughs) They want the best, huh? - Yeah, yeah. You know, Krago needs some help down at the conference. - I thought that was over with. - No, he is got one more lecture. He's running late. - Oh, geez, man. Why does he want me? - What can I say, man? He wants the best. - [Billy] Now? - Five minutes ago. - Oh, Jesus. I'll catch you later then, all right? - All right, man. I'll be here. (soft suspenseful music) (computer whirring) (soft suspenseful music) Okay, doc, let's see what you're up to. - Uh-oh. - Oh, shit. (computer whirring) - Ferris. - Wake. Shit head, wake up. - Huh? What? I'm ready. - Roll tape. - I got it. (soft suspenseful music) (keyboard clicking) - [Hutch] Ken! - Hutch. - [Hutch] get out of there right now. - What? - [Hutch] Ramsey is on his way up. - Jesus, Hutch! You're supposed to give me a warning ahead of time. - [Hutch] I just did! Why are you always yelling at me? - Okay, baby. Come on. Yes. (computer beeping) Okay. (soft suspenseful music) (elevator dinging) (soft suspenseful music) - Where is he? - I don't know. I've lost him. (elevator dinging) - Dr. Tully? - Ah, Miss? - Matthews. Sloane Matthews. - Right, Sloane. - You staying here, too? - Not for much longer. - You're not really a virologist, are you? - And you're not really a corporate exec, are you? - Sure I am. It's just that you're not the typical type, that's all. - And Krago is? - Ramsey Krago is a special breed. Maybe you are, too. How about buying me a drink? - Uh, maybe some other time. I have to go. - Oh, come on. Just one. Just one drink. Then you can decide whether you wanna stay or not. - Okay, just one. - What's he up to now? Oh, come on. Can't he ever just walk away? - Relax. Information flows smoother when mixed with alcohol. - Yeah, well, that's what I'm afraid of. One drink and he'll tell her everything. - Where the hell is security outside my office? What? Well, tell him to get his ass back over here! (soft dramatic music) (soft suspenseful music) (clock ticking) (soft suspenseful music) Well, well. Dr. Tully. Still like to play cat and mouse games, eh? - So what do you actually do for Krago? You're not a scientist. - I handle all of his public relations. - Is that all you do for him? - Meaning what, Dr. Tully? - Well, you seem so capable, that's all. - Well, it's a high risk job. Can't afford mistakes. - Sounds dangerous. - Dealing in viruses can be a deadly business. - Is that what this is? Business? - I haven't decided yet. - Look at her. Just look at her. She's all over him. - Marisa, I. - Good old Conway. Runs into the first girl in the lobby and bam. And he wonders why I didn't marry him. - No, I think he wonders why you walked out on your wedding day. (printer whirring) - You trying to beat me to the vaccine, Dr. Tully. Too bad it's not on this computer. Where the hell have you been? - Oh, I was told that you wanted me at the conference. - Who told you to leave your post? - He did. - Dr. Tully? - Dr. Tully? This is Ken Conway. He trained me. He's the best. - Well. The plot thickens. - I'd really like to see Krago's lab sometime. - Well, I might be able to arrange something. He owns an island off the coast. - Convenient. - I'm not sure I know what you mean. - A lab on an island in case there's an accident. It's isolated. - We don't have accidents at Krago Industries. You know how it is, Dr. Tully, having a lab of your own. We can't let, well, just anyone into high level research areas. - (chuckles) Of course. I understand completely. What do you wanna know? - Everything. - Here you are. Ken Conway. - Okay. I was born in Grants Pass. - Born in Kyoto, Japan. - I went to school at Oregon State. - Black Belt in Kenpo, '83. Second Dan. - After I graduated, I worked at a disease control center in Medford. - Enlisted US Rangers, '84. Applied Special Forces, '86. Lieutenant Colonel. - I can't believe him. He looks just like he did when he proposed to me. We'd only known each other a few weeks. He proposes. We set the date. Then he was sent away on some secret assignment. He was supposed to show back up again on the wedding day. The whole time he was gone, I got two faxes. He couldn't even phone. He faxes me, tells me he'll be there. The day of the wedding, I found out he'd been on a cruise with some rich bimbo just the week before. He showed up on our wedding day like nothing happened. - I knew about the girl. If he hadn't gone, they would've killed him. - You knew about the girl? - You know, you never bothered to ask why, did ya? You just disappeared. You see a couple of compromising photos and you freaked out. He just didn't wanna have to explain on your wedding day. He thought you had too much on your mind. Things got outta control. The operation was a bust. And that girl? That girl got him out, barely. No one got hurt. - No one but me. - My, my. (buttons beeping) (phone ringing) - Excuse me a minute. Yes? No, I'm busy right now. Would you like another drink, Dr. Tully? - [Ken] No, no thanks. I really gotta get going. (phone thuds) (Ramsey grunts) (Ramsey sighs) - You're an amazing woman, Sloane. Would you like to know who you're buying drinks for? - Wonderful. No, no, I'm not surprised. - I gotta go. It's been a pleasure. - No, wait, wait! - Stay right there. I'm coming down myself. Don't let him leave. - Dr. Tully! Dr. Tully! - I'll speak to Dr. Krago and arrange to get you on the island. - Really? - Yes. - Why don't I just talk to him myself? He'll be down here any second. (Ramsey grunts) Don't do it. Never seen you at a loss for moves, Billy. - He'll drop me in a second, sir. (soft suspenseful music) - Oh god, that's Krago. - Well, this is rather an embarrassing moment. Can I have my hand back please, Mr. Conway? Thank you very much. Ah, the infamous Ms. Sloane. - You know, Sloane offered to give me a tour of the island sometime. - Is that right? Well, I look forward to seeing you down there, Mr. Conway. By the way, have any luck finding your friend? - Not yet, but I'm getting closer. - Really? Good. Well. Well, happy hunting, Mr. Conway. - Don't let him touch you. (ring pricks) Shit! Call in the van, Leo! - I hope the rest of your trip is everything you want it to be. - Thank you. - Congratulations, Mr. Conway. (ring clicks) You're the first. It's a shame really. I could use a man like that. - So could I. - Have a nice drink? - For your information, I was (grunting). (Monica choking) (Monica panting) - Well, look who's awake. (Ken groaning) (punch smacking) (intense dramatic music) (horns honking) (Ken grunting) - Gimme, gimme your hand! Come on. (intense dramatic music) (Monica screaming) Help! Help! Leo, help! (Ken grunting) - [Ken] Help! Help! Help me get up. (intense dramatic music) (punch smacking) (Leo grunts) (pan thudding) (intense dramatic music) (Ken groaning) (Ken sighs) (Ken groaning) - Ken? - Oh, just when I started to fall for you. - How you feeling? - Great. Why are you wearing that? - [Anthony] Mr. Conway. - Who are they? - I'm Dr. Anthony Mane and I'm with the Center for Disease Control. - And I'm Special Agent McBride, FBI. - What's going on? - I don't know. They said it was really good. - What? - When Dr. Krago shook your hand, we thought he had injected you with something. We thought it might be snake venom. - And? - Well, the good news is it's not snake venom. - The bad news is he injected you with a virus. - What virus? - We don't know. It may be lethal. We have someone working on it right now. - [Monica] Hang on. - It's Ferris. Deadliest virus on the planet. It's not airborne yet. - Ferris? Filovirus. - Only one documented case. Africa. Kills within 48 hours. - Depending on blood circulation and body weight. - [Leo] Well, how do you know? - Read it off Krago's computer. Copied it to a disc. - The one we retrieved from your pocket. - [Ken] Yeah. - Maybe the vaccine is on the disc. - No, no such luck. I went through that with a fine tooth comb and there was no vaccine for Ferris in it. - Well, then you have to develop a vaccine. - That would take months, years. Who knows? Viruses are clever little things. And Ferris is the Rhode Scholar of viruses. All it is really is a shell of proteins. It tricks the body's cells into making carbon copies of itself. In most viruses, this is a very long process. You don't wanna kill the host because killing the host means killing the virus. But Ferris knows it can exist outside the host's body. It could sit on a roadway, bide its time, and wait for another host to come along. So it just multiplies until the host dies. - And then just starts house hunting again. - Exactly. - As a host, what should I expect? - Well, within the next 48 hours or so, providing you stay absolutely still, nothing. - Then? - The virus works its way through the veins, slowly blocking them up with dead cells. The body thinks it's losing blood, so it makes more. Then when the passages finally free up, there's a massive surge of blood. The organs can't cope. They explode, quite literally. The victim goes into a death spiral that lasts about 15 seconds. Now, as I said, the virus is not airborne yet. It could be passed with a shared glass. - Wait a minute. Could an airborne strain be easily made? - Yes. You see, once the virus is contained, mutating its genetic structure is relatively easy. - That's exactly what Krago's gonna do. He's going airborne with Ferris. - You must stay still, Mr. Conway. - Right. Where's Krago? - He's already left town. - Back to the island? - Yeah. - How fast can you get me there? - Oh, it takes 48 hours for approval on something like this. 55, 60 hours for arrival. - I'll be dead in 36. - I'm sure you know the procedure, Mr. Conway. - So what are you gonna do now? - I got the virus. I have to retrieve the vaccine. - Alone? - You must stay still. - And what? Wait to die? Not a chance. - I'm going with you. - Wait, wait, you can't. - Shut up, Leo. You go to the office and tell them. Somebody's gotta back him up. Is it gonna be you? - No, no, I'll go to the office and make the request. - I'll be there at 7:00am with a boat. - Great. (engine rumbling) - [Marisa] Ken? - Marisa, it's been a really long day. - I didn't mean for this to happen. - That makes two of us. - Look, I hired you because you're the best. I had no idea it was gonna turn out like this. - Every job I take is dangerous. I screwed up. I should have seen it coming. - No. I should never have gotten you involved in this in the first place. It's all my fault. I just wish I could take your place. Ken? I still love you. - Do you even know what that means? - Yeah, I think so. - Really? (Marisa sighs) (kiss smacking) - Now I've got the virus. 'Til death do us part. (mellow romantic music) (insects chirping) (water rippling) (door rattling) (soft dramatic music) (soft gentle music) Mmm. (intense dramatic music) Mmm. Mmm. Ken? (Marisa screams) (intense dramatic music) - Not quite. - [Ken] What can we expect on Krago's island? - [Monica] A lot of resistance. Krago keeps it heavily guarded 24 hours a day. - [Ken] Well, I guess we go in shooting. - [Monica] Maybe not. I've kind of got an idea. (intense dramatic music) (helicopter whirring) (doors rattling) (helicopter whirring) (engine rumbling) - Hi. I was just out diving and I couldn't turn my engine over. I think it might be flooded or something. - Hey, do you know this is a private beach? - No, I didn't. - Are you alone? - Well, um. Not quite. (intense dramatic music) (arm thuds) - Which way? - Over your shoulder. (tense suspenseful music) (guns firing) (soft dramatic music) (Ken panting) Nice shooting. - [Ken] Not so bad yourself. - How you feeling? - I'm all right. - Good, 'cause we have to get into that complex before dark. - All right, let's go. Come on. - Uh-huh. (intense dramatic music) Well? Where to? - Not that way. - So? (lift ratcheting) - Let's go up. (lift ratcheting) (tense suspenseful music) It's locked. - [Monica] Come on. Climb up. (tense suspenseful music) (keys jangle) (doors rattle) (soft suspenseful music) (lift ratcheting) (intense dramatic music) (lift ratcheting) (doors clattering) - They don't know how lucky they are. (guns firing) (tense suspenseful music) (guns firing) Ah! Cover me. - Yep. (guns firing) (Ken grunts) (tense suspenseful music) (Ken grunts) (kicks thud) (punches smacking) Ah! Oh! Oh! (kicks thudding) Oh! (kick thudding) Ah! (knife slices) Ah! Ah! Ah! Woo-ah! (punch smacking) Ah! (kick thudding) - Are you all right? (Ken grunts) Is it bad? (Ken panting) No. But maybe I'll bleed to death before I die first. - Well, I hope not. - Listen, we'll find the vaccine a lot faster if we split up. - I'll go this way. - Okay. (soft suspenseful music) - Hello, Mr. Conway. Glad to see you could make it. Don't bother looking. I'm nowhere near you, I assure you. But let me take you on a personal tour of my laboratory. I'll tell you what. Let's play a little game of hot or cold. Cold. Antarctica cold. - How do I know you're not lying? - You're a dying man, Mr. Conway. You're just gonna have to trust me. (Ken panting) Warm. Say, Tokyo on a spring night. (Ken panting) (soft suspenseful music) (bomb clicks) (Ken panting) (steam hissing) (tense suspenseful music) (Ken grunts) (bomb clicks) (tense suspenseful music) Don't you feel like a rat caught in a maze, Mr. Conway? (tense suspenseful music) (guns firing) (tense suspenseful music) (gun firing) Warmer. Like the temperature in your body. All this running around is helping Ferris do its work, Mr. Conway. Are you feeling hot, perspiring? Cold. But an interesting choice. (Ken panting) I see you found my freezer room. I do most of my disease experiments on human patients. I find that rabbits and monkeys just don't give me a realistic view of what a good lethal disease can accomplish. (soft suspenseful music) - Oh, God. You never told them what you were injecting 'em with. - Of course not. That would spoil all the fun. - You created the diseases so you can make millions on the vaccines. - Well, you don't think I'm going to wait around for a lethal disease to break out, do you, Mr. Conway? That would take much too long. These five people gave their lives to find cures for the diseases that I created. Rather noble gesture, don't you think? - Sick bastard! Where are you? - You're running out of time, Mr. Conway. And getting angry will only cause the virus to multiply faster. Let's go back to our game, Mr. Conway. (Ken grunts) (Ken coughs) (soft suspenseful music) (door bangs) (gun firing) Nice shooting. I'm very impressed. I didn't expect you to make it this far. (Ken panting) You're probably having a hard time breathing, aren't you, Mr. Conway? Need that vaccine. (Ken grunting) Happen to have some in my hand right now. If only you could find me. (Ken panting) (doorknob rattling) (gun firing) Mr. Conway, you have to play by the rules. - Dr. Tully. Or is it Conway? So good of you to come and see me on such short notice. - Where is he? - He's close. - Where? - Patience, patience. All good things come to those who wait. - I don't have much time. - Dr. Krago is not the only one who can give you what you want, you know? - I want the vaccine. - Of course you do. (kiss smacking) (Ken chuckles) - I'm infected. - I'm immune. - I should have known. - You want the vaccine, don't you? Ah-ah-ah. I'll give it to you, but first you have to do something for me. - Mr. Conway. Where are you? (Marisa grunting) (Ken grunts) - Oh, come on, Conway. It's not like you haven't done it before. You'll be alive. She'll understand. - I don't think so. - But your life depends on it. - Yeah. I know. - You really love her, don't you? What an overrated emotion. It's pathetic. He's got her, you know? - Where? - In the lab. - Krago's a dead man. - And so are you. - You can't possibly escape. All the doors and exits have been locked by computer. Won't you come out and play my game? (Ken panting) (Ken coughing) Welcome back to the game, Mr. Conway. (doorknob clicks) (gun firing) (Ramsey tutting) So brutal. (Ken coughing and grunting) - Ramsey! Where the hell are you? - [Ramsey] I'm right here. - She's already dead. (Ken grunting) - No, she's not. I gave her the vaccine. See, I was gonna grab the two of you this morning, but you left a little earlier than expected. - Let her go. - Mmm, no. I think I want her to watch this. (Marisa panicking) - Give him the vaccine, please. I'll do whatever you want. - This is what I want. Right now your internal organs are enlarging due to blood surge. You see, that's the beauty of Ferris. It's the ultimate parasite. No life of its own, so it just clings onto yours until yours is gone. Nothing personal. (Ken grunting) Doesn't mean to cause harm. Just wants to replicate and spread. (Ken gasps) You see, right now you're in the last few seconds of your life. Your liver is gone. Your lungs have burst. Your bladder's in shreds. How does it feel? (Ken gasps) Goodbye, Mr. Conway. (gun clicking) You were supposed to be dead. - Not quite. - He'll kill her on my command. - Probably true. But once I blow your brains all over the ceiling, he won't have a boss. No job. No money. I don't think he'll do it. Because he knows I'll kill you. Looks like we have a Mexican standoff here. - Poor Ramsey. You've lost your focus. Your obsessive behavior is bad for business. Pull the trigger, Conway. Come on. That's the deal. He's made too many mistakes. - You're in this as deep as I am, Sloane. - My deal was to put him away, not kill him so you can take over the company. - Well, if you won't, I will! (guns firing) - Ah! (guns firing) (intense dramatic music) - Well, looks like you got the company all to yourself now. - Looks that way, doesn't it? What about us? - (laughs) Us? There's no us. I'll tell you what. Since you gave me the vaccine, I'll let you walk away. I'll give you a head start. We'll see each other again. (soft dramatic music) (gun fires) (Sloane gasps) (Sloane thuds) - Never turn your back on a woman with a gun and a motive. - I thought you got lost. - Not hardly. - [Ken] Let's get outta here before this whole place goes up. - Where's the vaccine? - [Marisa] It's in his coat, bottom pocket. - Let's go. (intense dramatic music) (guns firing) What are you doin'? - You've got the only vaccine. Take off. I'll be right behind you. (gun firing) - Here, take mine. (intense dramatic music) (Marisa screams) (Ken screams) (bones cracking) (kick thudding) (Ken grunts) (bones cracking) (guard grunts) - Conway! (gun firing) (intense dramatic music) (gun firing) - That'll be good right there. (Ramsey grunts) - But you were dead. - Little trick I picked up from Mr. Conway. Well, you seemed to have misplaced your peppy repertoire. Got a date, Mr. Conway? - Duck! (explosion booming) (metal clattering) Look out! (punches thudding) Shit! (Ken grunting) (punches thudding) (kick thudding) - Is he dead? - [Ken] He's toast. (explosions booming) (intense dramatic music) (explosions booming) (intense dramatic music) (Marisa groaning) (soft dramatic music) (flames crackling) - Conway! - You made it. - Of course I made it. You guys okay? - I think she needs a doctor. - I'll grab the team and we'll have her outta here in no time. - Monica. - Thanks. Bravo one, Bravo one. This is McBride. Do you read? - [Pilot] Loud and clear, McBride. What the hell is going on down there? - [Monica] Just a little spring cleaning, that's all. Get me a paramedic on the southeast corner of the complex ASAP. Let's stay in the air with the other two choppers until I signal you. - [Pilot] Roger that. Bravo three proceed to southeast corner. Paramedic needed. (helicopter whirring) - You sure you're all right? - Oh, you tell me? Do I still have my arms and legs? - (chuckles) Yeah. - Then I guess I'm okay. Oh, wait, wait, wait. Ow. Oh. Wait one moment. Ow. So when exactly did she become Monica? - (chuckles) You mean McBride? She's FBI. - Oh, I know who she is. You look me in the eye and tell me she's not gorgeous. - She's attractive. But- - [Marisa] But what? - I love you. (explosion booming) - [Marisa] Ken? - [Ken] Yeah? - [Marisa] Are we dead? - [Ken] I don't know. Can you see anything? - [Marisa] No, it's too dark. - [Ken] We can't be dead. - [Marisa] Well, that's just great. You finally say you love me and we're dead. - [Ken] We're not dead. - [Marisa] How do you know that? Can you see anything? - [Ken] No. But we could have been blinded by the explosion. - [Marisa] Oh, right. We're not dead. We're just gonna be blind for the rest of our lives. - [Ken] Blind dead, not blind. - [Marisa] What's the difference? We still can't see. - [Ken] Wait a minute. Is that your leg? - [Marisa] Yeah. And I can feel your hands. - [Ken] Good, good, good. And there's your stomach and your- - [Marisa] Conway! - [Ken] Oh, sorry. Wait a minute. I know what this is. And this, too. - [Marisa] Conway. - [Ken] Look, as long as we're dead, we might as well enjoy it. - [Marisa] This time, you're right.
