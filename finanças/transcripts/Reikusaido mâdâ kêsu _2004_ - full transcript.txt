What kind of environment do you try to create for your son? l try to foster a sense of self-reliance. l told you not to be late! Where's your tie? Sorry, Iong night at the office. ls that your excuse?! l wish you'd take this seriously. Hi, dad. Maika! l'm sorry. Everyone's waiting. Your tie! Sorry to keep you waiting. Shall we begin? Mr. Tsukumi's training the kids. How d'you do? l'm Namiki. Let's get right to the interview. Yes, of course? Mr. Namiki? Why do you wish your daughter to attend our school? lt's a basic question. For its tradition, l suppose. You suppose?... Yes. Its tradition. What tradition is that? Please elaborate, Mr. Namiki. l don't know. Private schools have very specific principles. lt's vital that guardians understand them. These intereviews assess that understanding. Your answer here is important. Next question. You became Maika's father when she was three, correct? Did that pose disciplinary problems? ls that a necessary question? You should answer all questions cheerfully. Or you will surely ruin your daughter's chances. We'll stop here. Let's exercise before dinner. Thank you very much. Take five minutes to change. Remove this. Thank you for coming, Mr. Namiki. l'm Fujima. Namiki. Excuse my tardiness. My wife and l are at your disposal. l'm Kazue. Welcome. And l am Sekitani. l'm Yasuko. Your wife and l go back to college. Yes. How do you do? This study retreat should help our children... ...enter Shubunkan Middle School. Minako was so pleased to have you as Maika's father... Oops, l'm being obnoxious. Not at all. Thank you. Oh, l almost forgot! You have a visitor. l'm sorry to keep you waiting. Ms. Takashima, what are you doing here? Ms. Takashima's the photographer working with me. My wife. Mrs. Namiki, l'm deeply indebted to your husband for the work. How do you do? l hope he isn't working you too hard. Oh, no. In fact, l've brought him some. l thought you'd need this. You shouldn't have gone to such trouble. l'm very sorry to intrude. No, no! Don't be silly. Thank you. Good luck with the retreat. lt surely is beautiful here... Close by the lake... Have you seen it yet? l thought l'd take in the sights. Why not? You deserve the break? Well, good-bye. Thanks. Dear? Your luggage. Oh, right! The three of us in here?! The kids stay in a separate cottage. By themselves? Mr. Tsukumi is with them. Right, you told me. - Over the phone, remember? - Right. - You haven't read this, have you? - l have. Please read it. This is some cottage. lt pays to be a doctor. Envious? Hardly. l could never be one. And Mr. Sekitani's in construction? Must be nice to have wealth and security. You ought to be thinking about Maika. I am, beIieve me. But... is all this really necessary? Excuse me?! ls this really in Maika's best interes? Look... l know you've come at a busy time, but, please, try to act like an interested parent. What's that supposed to mean? l'm sorry if that offends you. l am serious about Maika... very serious. Everyone can tell we've separated. Show some tact! Why hide the truth? Because the school frowns upon it. Fine, we'll find another school! lt's not worth a big facade. You're impossible! Divorce, remarriage, separation... ...and then there are your ''visions''. lt's all been hard on Maika! And now this elite schol pressure? Poor girl! l finally want to do something right by her! She shouldn't lead a life like mine. What? Has your life been such a failure?! - No, but... - l admire you. l don't regret a thing. Don't you?! Then why are we separated? Because you kept insisting l was cheating on you. There you go again, shifting blame. Maika and l matter little to you. Now, just a minute! Forget it. Maika's my child. My child only. l won't take anymore of your time. What's that supposed to mean? Look, just respect my wishes while we're here, okay? That's all. l've got to change. ''Shubunkan Middle School'' l didn't know... ...entrance exams had a physical! ''Shubunkan'' gauges physical aptitudes, yes. lt reveals character. Poor kids... What about you? Sorry? From your greeting l'd say... ...you went to a private school. J It wasn't ''Shunbunkan'' was it? Damn that girl! What's she up to?! What's this? A school brochure. l took the photos. Oh... Why? Nothing. Don't tell me... ...your daughter? lt wasn't my idea. Hey, l'm working! What's this photo? What's the meaning of this? Of what? Don't tell me that's your wife?! Please leave a message. What's wrong? Nothing. Barbecue's starting. Gotcha. What is it? ls this retreat a drag? You sound like your mother! Please! Nothing that involves you is a drag, okay? Okay. Evening. ls work okay? Yes, thank you. What's this? Good evening. Mr. Tsukumi invited her. She's had experience with exams like this. l'm sorry. l tried to decline. What for? The more, the merrier. Especially a young woman. That's not what l meant. Oh, thank you. lt's ready. Come and get it. All right! Everybody, the food's ready! Shall we go? Don't be shy. Go apologize. All right. l owe you an apology. None necessary. Here, this one's cooked. Let me relieve you. l enjoy this. Could you serve this instead? Was that good enough? Give it your best tomorrow. You've gone to great lengths to hold this retreat for your children. Well it's our kids'future... lt's worth the trouble. Your children are so lucky. My schooling is what led to my parents' divorce. They thought the better the school... ...the more happines it would bring. But the costs grew too high. They fought incessantly. l eventually dropped out. lt all seems so silly now. The problem isn't the exam system. lt produces people like Mr. Tsukumi You graduated top of your class, right? And l'm a prep school instructor now. A very respectable job. Only to my pupils' parents. What about your train, Ms. Takashina? She's staying here. Yes. At the ''Lakeside Hotel. '' Father, where's the mosquito repellant? ln the garage. Everyone, the meat's ready. - l'll serve it. - Let's all go. Don't you think it's odd Mr. Tsukumi invited ''her''? l couldn't agree more. She's your colleague, right? Are you okay? Sure, why? l mean, with Mom. Don't worry. We're fine. Only while we're here, right? A lot of studying? l'll manage. You know, a public school is perfectly fine by me. Shh, they'll hear us. Don't worry about me. Children, assemble! Bid goodnight to your parents. Thank you for dinner. Good night. Good night. Well, good night. l pity them. What's with that photo? It's creepy. The hotel lounge at 10. No way! Thank you very much for your warm hospitality. Oh, it was nothing. Mrs. Namiki. Thank you. Well... Take care. l will. Good night. She left without even offering to clean up. - Sorry. - Why are you sorry? That's enough for tonight. Thank you very much. - l made coffee. - Thank you. Minako... - l have to return to Tokyo. - Now? lt's urgent, but l'll be back by morning. Can't someone cover for you? l'd wish, believe me. Well, all right. l'm terribly sorry. lt can't be helped. Drive safely. Thank Mr. Fujima for me. What's wrong? Nothing. Then don't look at me like that. What is she doing? Who's this? Mr. Tsukumi? Please leave a message. lt's me. l just got a call from work. Problem's solved. l'm on my way back. Back here? Yeah. l'll be there in 10 minutes. Are you there? Can you hear me? Yes. Understood. See you soon. l didn't need to return after all. ls something the matter? What is this? See for yourself. l killed her. What? What happened, Minako? Tell me! As soon as you left, she called. She wanted to speak to me alone. Everyone had gone to bed. So l agreed. And? She insisted l divorce you. She said that? So you murdered her? - Of course not! - Then why? She threatened to tell everyone: Maika, the school... Before l knew it, l'd hit her. Your wife came to our room. We then called Mr. Fujima. Why don't we sit down? - l'll make coffee. - Are you nuts? What, then?! D'you have any ideas? This is your fault, Mr. Namiki. Take it easy, dear! Why should l? This is the result of their problems. We now you're separated. We pretended not to notice. You have your child to think of. But to bring your mistress here?! - l didn't bring her. - Apologize! lt's okay. Don't, Minako! l'm at your mercy. l beg your forgiveness. Please get off your knees. Have you called the police? What's your address here? Why do you need that for? To tell the police. We've thought about that already. Mr. Namiki, this is our cottage. Our children came to study. l'm sorry. You're sorry? A wife kills her husband's lover at a kids' study camp. lf this gets out, the press will have a field day! You realize what that'll do to the kids? You're not going to the police? We have no choice! No choice? That's crazy! - You're the crazy one! - Take it easy! We make like nothing happened. J Mrs. Namiki you'd confess if put in police cutody, right? Yes. That's why we can't go to them. A person is dead! We can't... lt's your wife we're talking about here! What about you? Can you pretend nothing happened? Can you? Please, calm down. She'll need to collect her thoughts. Unfortunately, we don't have much time. And we need your cooperation. Right now, you need to think about the children. Can l speak with my wife alone? They're crazy! They're definetely crazy! They've gone completely nuts! No, it's you who's crazy. What, are you with them?! There is no ''them''. What about you? ls bringing your lover here rational? l promise... ...l'll raise Maika until your return. She's smart. She'll understand. You'll be a devoted father and husband? Yes. And you'll raise Maika in my absence? Correct. You're lover dies, so you just go home? Now is not the time! - You were serious about her. - No! She didn't want that. l was planning on ending it. Oh, l see. Abandoning her, too? Not just Maika and me, but her as well! And now she's dead for that? l haven't abandoned you! Go ask Maika! ''She's smart. She'll understand''? You don't know a thing about her! ln the end, it's just about you. That's all you care about. But that's okay. l'm to blame, for falling for you. Don't ask to start over. lt won't last. You're wrong! l'm the only one who can raise Maika. l'm her only parent. So... ...l'm not going to the police. lt'd destroy her. So you just... ...pretend that nothing happened? Nine years ago... ...you made a promise... ...to make Maika happy. Have you forgotten? What did you say to me earlier? What are you talking about? Look at me! You told me not to look at you ''that way''. You never feared my look before! This isn't the time! Yes, it is! lt's all related. You've changed, but Maika and l haven't. That won't change! So l won't be arrested. lt'd ruin Maika's life. We need a decision soon. Now that we're together in this... ...Iet's dispose of the body. What do you mean by ''dispose''? Get rid of it. But what if we're seen? Precisely why we must be careful. Without a body, there's no murder. But if found, can't it be identified? And traced back to Mr. Namiki? We make sure that if found, it can't be identified. How? By destroying the face, fingerprints and teeth. What about DNA testing? Wouldn't that identify the body regardless of its condition? DNA testing is only conducted... ...when there's already an idea as to its identity. lt's of little use without clues. But the point is to make sure the body is never found. Just dig a hole and burry her? We couldn't dig one safe enough. Correct. Listen to the construction man. l'm not in the field. Excuse me. So what do we do? We go the surest and easiest route. You mean....the lake? At this hour? No one will be out. We'll have to tie some heavy stones to the body. Mr. Sekitani you and l will colleit some. ln the meantime, Mr. Namiki wrap the body so it can be easily carried. This blanket could leave a clue. That! The plastic tablecloth. Wrap the body in that. Let's hurry! Are you okay? Stop staring! Okay, here. Are we ready? Why our car? Because of the flatbed. Takuya sleeps here! So we'll sell it, or have it purified. Unbelievable! - Ready? - Yes. Don't forget this. Face, teeth and fingerprints? Clothes and accessories, too. We strip her? To be safe, yes. - Wait! Wait! - What? ls that necessary? Think of her as a mannequin. We'll burn those later. Lend me your lighter. We must hurry, so l'll do it. Mr. Namiki, teeth and face? Okay, leave it to me. Would you like a last look? - Okay? - Yes. You'd better turn away. Okay, that's fine. Give me hand. Light, please. Here, too. Okay, we're set. Mr. Sekitani, wait in the car. - Do you have your cell phone? - Yes. Call us if you have to. We can come ashore elsewhere, if we have to. Understood. Let's go. Where to? The middle should be deapest. lt's too dark to tell. Just get close. What're we doing? Please, try not to think about it. This is a very serious matter. Yes it is. There's no turning back. lt's too late to reconsider. How woud you explain... ...a naked body, pulverized face and burnt fingertips? l can understand your sympathy for this woman. But, please, try to forget her. Here's fine. Okay. He can't possibly see us. All right... Rise slowly or we'll tip the boat. Hold it! That could have sent us overboard. lt's stuck. The lighter. Try again. Careful! Don't make a sound. Let's go home. Sorry. l dropped something. What? My lighter. ls it special? My initials are on it. There's nothing we can do. Let's return. Yes, you're right. Don't tell anyone about this. Of course....sorry. - Anything out of the ordinary? - That car startled me but... Everything went all right? Thank you. Hold it. We'll need this. Her hotel room key. Good. We need to have her checkout tomorrow morning. Her? Ms. Takashina. Otherwise she'll be reported missing. She needs to return to Tokyo. But... We'll make it look that way. Pretend to be her? Precisely. - Mrs. Namiki? - l'll go. That's ok. l'll do it. Thank you, Yasuko. The front desk should be closed now. Go into her room and pack her things. When you checkout, bring her bags to me and Mr. Namiki. We'll take them to her home in Tokyo. Mr. Namiki, do you know where she lives? Yes. And you have a key? Yes. , Afterwards, Mrs. Namiki return here. Yes, but what if l'm not here tomorrow morning... We'll just say you're not feeling well. Around noon, Mr. Namiki and l will say we're going out to buy groceries. ls that really necessary? ls what necessary? What's excessive? Going to her apartment in Tokyo. l repeat. Ms. Takashina can't go missing here. She must return to her home in Tokyo... ...and leave her things there. That puts us in the clear. Then l'll go alone. Two people reduce the risk of an oversight. But... Mr. Namiki there's no room for argument. Please drive your wife to the hotel. That attached to her things? Don't start. l'm an acomplice now. lf l hadn't killed her... ...you'd be lying with her now. Don't be ridiculous. Your ''urgent business'' was an invitation from her. You didn't fool me. Did she say she invited me? l forgot. We were both pretty excited. Had she been drinking? She must have, to have come see you. She probably had. Could you go now? lt'll dawn in a couple of hours. l'll wait in the parking lot. You said l've changed. But so have you Your eyes have changed. Perhaps you're right. Did you see my death? l can't see that far. Then what? You wouldn't believe me. Then l gues we'll never truly be husband and wife. We'll end without even having achived that. Welcome back. Any problems? No. We restrict drinking to dinner but... ...we'll make an exception. Mr. Namiki? What was she like? Personally, l find your wife a far more attractive wooman. But you chose Ms. Takashina. What made her special? lt was her youth, wasn't it? How can you ask that? l'm not going to answer that. Please do. l had to destroy her face. That doesn't matter. Mr. Namiki. Mr. Namiki? l won't be able to sleep either, you know. But it's strange though. Our conscience doesn't bother us when we kill a fly or a cockroach. Did her life have meaning? You... ...can you hear yourself? Relax. l'm just trying to kill time. Good night. Well, let's eat. Where's mother? She's in her room. She's not feeling well. Really? She's just a bit tired. Give her some time to rest. All right. Maika, you're breakfast. Coming. Tell her to take it easy. She's a wonderful child. Even we feel proud of her. You must feel especially so. With you laying the rails... ...she should go far in life. For her sake... ...Iet's see this through, all right? What's he doing? Well, we're off. After dinner, we'll hold a parent interview. Do you have everything? Yes, l have. You left no traces? l was very careful. What did that porter say to you? He offered to call a taxi. l said l wanted to see the lake. Wundebar....Wonderful. Take care now. l will. We have to determine exactly what we can and can't reveal. She said she came to deliver you some work. But that was a lie. She came to see you, right? This is important. Please answer truthfully. lt seems so. That means she probably didn't tell anyone at work she was coming. Deny seeing her. Won't that raise suspicion? You two were having an illicit affair. Lying is natural. Confess to it only if... ...the police find out she came up to the lake. You met her in secret. But she returned to Tokyo afterwards. You don't miss a thing, don't you? l'm a surgeon. Why'd you kill her? What? l told you. She threatened to talk about your affiar. l just can't believe you'd kill for that. There are plenty of other junior schools. Can this be that important? lt is important. So important you'd do anything? lt's not you everyone's protecting. lt's someone else. What are you saying? Why did she have these? l don't know. She was killed because of these, wasn't she? l killed her. No! Mr. Tsukumi killed her. You've all been bribing him, haven't you? No! l killed her! Enough! Wait! Please sit down. May l speak to you in private? Not here. Outside. l assume you know what's been going on here. What do you mean? Takashina Eriko's death. Her murder... ...by you. She threatened to expose your receiving payoffs. Didn't she? That's why she came here. So you killed her. And my wife covered for you. No, not just my wife. Everyone covered for you... ...in exchange for... ...guaranteed school entry. lt was easier to make it look like my wife did it. And l'd have to cooperate. ls that basically right? l've no idea what you're talking about. Bullshit! Dad, your food's getting cold. l'll be right in. l'll pretend this conversation didn't take place. l know what you've been up to. Aren't you ashamed of yourself? l didn't fancy myself an hero. But you're an educator! Take a five minutes break, kids! l'm just a prep school instructor. That's your excuse? See it as you please. How pitiful. ls it money? l want to tell you something. l'm sure you know this but... l'm the man your parents hired to get you into Shubunkan. That much is true. However... ...no one know you better than l. l know how much you love your parents. l know the pressure you feel trying to live up to to their expectations. Believe me, l know. l went through the same thing. But as long as l'm here, you needn't worry. l exist for you. Okay? Let me ask you a basic question, Mr. Namiki. What do you think of the entrance exam system? l don't oppose it, but l have my doubts. What kind of doubts? Aboiut parents deciding what's best for their kids. You're saying that kids should decide for themselves? Esentially, yes. What do you all think of Mr. Namiki's views? l oppose it, of course. Children hate to study, Mr. Namiki. lf left to them, they'd choose the easiest way. So, instead, we subject them to exam hell? Children should be allowed the freedom to grow. Competion is healthy. lt's what our society is based upon. Yes, they should have freedom. But they also have to learn the joy of winning from an early age. ls that so? l don't think l've ever felt ''the joy of winning. '' l just recall the faces of those that Iost, including mine. The pain. A person can survive and thrive outside of competition. What crap! The point is to enable our kids to handle competiotion. l'd prefer a world that doesn't divide people... ...into winners and losers... ...at least for my daughter. Mr. Namiki. That's an admirable idea. l agree with it. But that's a world we will not see. At least not now. Right now, you should try to work alongside the others. Work alongside the others? Even if it means killing someone over an entrance exam? Mr. Namiki. l hesitated in front of the children. But l have a question for all of you. A few moments ago l suspected you all for covering up for Mr. Tsukkumi. But that's not quite right. The cover-up itself is suspicious. lt seems you all are guilty. You all conspired to kill Eriko. Mr. Fujima? You were oout when l left the cottage last night. Where were you? l get it. You are all each other's alibi. Right, Mr. Sekitani? How dare you say that to people trying to save your wife? Forget it, he'll never understand! One more question. Where did the murder happen? l'd almost forgotten. When l was wrapping Eriko's body... ...l found dirt under her fingernails. You say you killed her, Minako. How do you then explain her dirty fingernails? Don't you find that odd? She wasn't killed here, was she? Maybe at some rendezvous point by the lake. Mr. Tsukumi? Why do you ask me? Don't play dumb! That isn't my intention. You saw the photos! All right. Mr. Tsukumi? Mrs. Namiki? lt's time we told him the truth. Damn right. So l'm correct. lt was you, right? Well? Was it or wasn't it? l didn't kill her. Let me ask you a question. Say your child committed murder. Would you report it? Or conceal it? What?! Have you noticed the kids' expressions earlier on? Have you sensed anything? That's absurd! That was the same reaction we all had. That's impossible. Minako! Was it Maika? Are you saying Maika did it? Mr. Namiki. lt's clear to everyone you love your daughter. Truth is, real parents... ...can't help but love their children. They'd do anything for them. Yes, Ms. Takashina did threaten me. But not about guaranteeing entry. l don't have that kind of power. So? What then? The exam questions. Ms. Takashina found l had them. This explains the dirt, Mr. Namiki. We were to meet not far from here. l told Mr. Fujima about the threat... ...and arrived at the appointed meeting place a few minutes late. Mr. Tsukumi? l'll call the police! Wait! Mrs. Namiki... ...would you summon Mr. Fujimia? After that, we all brought the body here. l and Mr. Sekitani... ...cleaned up all of the footprints. Oh, God! There! We regret making your wife take the blame. l volunteered. Why? That woman came because of you! Which child was it? - Which child killed her? - Stop it! They all wore the same shoes. There were many footprints. We went over it again and again. But we came to no conclusioon. Everyone wants to believe their child is different! lt might've been one... ...or all three of them. Are you saying they killed her together? l'm saying... ...it's possible. Motive. What motive would they have? You're not likely to find one with children. But it's possible they overheard me and Ms. Takashina. And viewed her as a threat. Come on! Children are capable of... Don't be stupid! Don't you understand anything?! Children grow up watching their parents. Your children are very capable of killing a person. Especially if they were raised by... ...selfish, cowardly, greedy parents like yoursleves. Your kids saw it long ago. What?....Saw what? How ugly and pathetic doting parents can be. Mr. Tsukumi. You are going too far. l remember how it was. Ans so did Ms. Takashina. She was right in trying to stop what we were doing. She was better than us. Mr. Tsukumi? Do you resent your parents? ls that whom we've entrusted our own children to? Well? l don't resent them. l don't hate my own parents. l'm saddened by them. l can't forget the pity they made me feel. You remember, don't you, Mr. Fujima? That feeling of pity. And the rest of you? l know you all felt it. l guess l'd forgotten. That's all. What do you say, Mr. Namiki? That's why... ...l vowed to be different! That's all l have to say. lf all of you are still together on this... ...then l've got work to do with the children. l'm a professional. Tomorrow starts early. Good night. Will you join us in putting this incident behind us? You mean just forget it? Should we forget it? As parents, shouldn't we try to understand? l don't understand. Me neither. l can't understand... ...my own child. We, too, have tried hard to understand our child. And we've come to the conclusion we cannot. So you just give up?! Who's giving up? That's what a real parent does! You don't know how lucky you are! Mr. Namiki... ...if our child did it... ...we'd still love him. We're all they have for protection. Mr. Namiki. We're asking you to be a parent like us. We may appear crazy to you... ...but, to protect our home and children, we've no choice. lt's easy to judge someone else's child. But to let yours be criminalized, ostracized... confined to a penitenciary, just isn't a parent! lf you could... ...understand how we feel... ...you'd know real fatherhood. We may be the ugly parents Mr. Tsukumi was talking about We may be a disappointment to our kids. But that ugliness, then... ...is something we have to bear! We lay the foundations for our children's happiness. We don't care how dirty we get in doing so! l mean... Mrs. Namiki. Ma'am? When you met with Mr. Tsukumi... ...where were you heading? To a hotel, right? l said initially you couldn't be trusted. But then your wife said that, if she took the blame, that might bring you back as a true father. Mr. Namiki. Your wife loves you. Your daughter loves you. l need to be alone. Okay, see you later. Give my love to Dad. Sorry it's so early. l understand. Bye-bye. Did l wake you? When did you get back? A moment ago. Was that your mother? Yeah. l was thinking at the same thing. You beat me to it. Go ahead. You doing it is enough. Remember... ...when we first met? You said you could see the future. You remember? And l said: ''So that's why you have....'' ''...such beautiful eyes. '' You do remember... Well? Can you see Maika's future? My future? Your future? Do we work it out? The future... ...is found... ...inside of us. Just need to build it? Right. ''We believe your institution will give our daughter....'' ''...the tools she'll need to succeed in a global society....'' ''...armed with knowledge, wisdom, vision....'' ''...the flexibility....'' ''...and the ability to make her own decisions.
