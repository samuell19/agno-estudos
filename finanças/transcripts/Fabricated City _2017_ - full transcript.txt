They all said the tree was rotten. But I... I told them the tree wasn't rotten. That night... I had a dream. And so... In the dream, I saw the tree. Grow strong towards the blue sky. I gathered everyone again. And told them the tree wasn't rotten. The tree... ...isn't rotten. All units, rappel! Rappel! Rappel! Now! CAPTAIN KWON Cover and Conceal, disconnect enemy comm! Roger!

He should quit playing this game. -Sorry. -The team won, that's what matters. My, Captain... You're so dope. You don't need to flatter him. All of the serious gamers call him Captain already. So what, I'm always getting killed. That's because you're always trying to save others. You're the one to talk, Mr Hairy. Alright, we won today. Let's meet up for dinner, okay? Bring 30 dollars each! Captain, please come tonight! Being mysterious is overrated. We win every time. So we want to see your face. -How's BBQ intestines? -Call! BBQ with Captain! I'm really busy nowadays... -Come on. -No! -Another time, perhaps. -No, I want to see you. Why are you so busy all the time? I'm getting nonstop work calls. -I'm logging off. -What? No! -What? -Where are you? At the internet cafe again? So what? Are you a kid? You're always playing games. What do you want? I left the stove gas valve on. Go lock it. That's why you called me? -Gas valve? -It could blow up. Go right now. Why would it blow up? I'm busy. So proud of you, you freeloader. Come on! I told you I'm working overnight today. Go when I ask you nicely. -I'm really busy! -See you tomorrow, Son. Mom! Mom! Pretty, isn't it? My son bought it for me on a school trip. It's germanium. It's good for health, apparently. TEAM ELIMINATED Hello? Is this the internet cafe? I left my phone there. Could you bring it to me? -I'm at... -Wait a minute. I'm a really busy man. I'll pay you 300 dollars. I don't believe this. Where are you? Excuse me. Anyone here? What the hell? Excuse me? I brought your phone back. Oh, you're here. I'm in the shower. You can leave it anywhere. You said you'd pay me. It's on the bed upstairs. Okay. I left your phone on your bed. Excuse me. You should lock the door. It's dangerous. Get him! Grab him! Hold still! -Don't resist! -Calm down! You're under arrest for statutory rape and murder. You may plea the Fifth... What... -Call the forensics. -Yes, sir. I said don't move! Bring the camera. The suspect who murdered and raped... ...an underage victim, Ms Ha... ...was arrested this morning. The signature on this check... It's yours, isn't it? That's right. It is, but this is... What about your fingerprints all over this knife? That's what I don't... I don't know how... The suspect was a national taekwondo athlete. But he was dismissed after an assault case. He, then, got addicted to violent videos games... Can't believe that guy was a national athlete. -Ma'am! -Where's my son? -Let go! -Calm down. -I want my son. -Get out. -Kwon Yu! -Get her out of here! The suspect is denying all charges. Some fingerprints and DNA were found at the scene. They were sent to the lab for a DNA comparison. We found a tissue at the scene, This report says your sperm was on it. My son is not a murderer. Please read this. Please read this. Please read this. My son was framed. Please read this, thank you. You have no conscience, he's a monster. The DNA found at the scene matched the suspect. The court is pressured to hand out a shift justice. Attorney Min. My son would never kill a person. Please look at this. You can leave it there. Please take a look. This is an award he won. Sir, since he was little... Hello, attorney-at-law, Min Chun-sang. Yes, I'm a public defender. Is there a problem? Don't worry too much. Send us the documents, and I'll review them. Yes, okay. Call me tomorrow. He didn't have his father growing up. So I raised him even more strictly. Ma'am, this is my opinion. I think you should... ...convince your son to confess. At least he'll get extenuation. But Mr Min... All the evidence are against him. So if he continues to deny, it could get worse... Ma'am, ma'am? Could we talk? The police told you to come here, right? Mr Min is devoted to helping those in need. So if you go home and wait... Mr Min! Please believe my son. The defendant left the scene after the murder. Only collected the 300 dollars... The prints on the knife and the door knob... They all match Kwon Yu's. The defendant sexually assaulted a minor twice. Then stabbed her 31 times, causing her death. And moved the body to the washroom to destroy... I didn't do it. Please be quiet! I really didn't do it. This is what happens to an overindulgent addict. He can't tell reality from fantasy. That's why he committed antisocial acts. And without any remorse. Killing people... Don't waste our taxes, castrate him! If you're not going to execute him, just cut it off. Councilor Park introduced the "Kwon Yu Bill". It includes harsher punishment for violent crimes. After his dismissal from the national team... He suffered from heavy depression. Please take it into account. There are clear evidence against him. But the defendant refuses to admit any wrongdoings. And he consistently told us lies. As such... The defendant is found guilty of the following. A charge of sexual assault. A charge of rape against a minor. And he is also charged with murder in the first degree. The defendant is sentenced as follows. Life imprisonment without parole. It wasn't my son! It wasn't my son! No! It wasn't me! I don't know anything! Kwon Yu! It wasn't me! Mom! Mom! Mom! The defendant's identity will be made visible. For 10 years, to the public. As a part of rehabilitation for the claimee... Court orders a 5-year sexual impulse treatment. In addition, the nature of his crime is vicious. Thus, this court believes he needs to be isolated. He will be taken to the maximum security prison. -Wait! Wait, wait! -Move. -Wait! -Move! Move, you bastard! No, it wasn't me! It wasn't me! You, move, move. Move. Out of my way! You came in for this, right? Rape. A kiddie... Come on. It wasn't me. You bastard! How dare you talk back! Son of a bitch! Look around, look at them. They're all proud of their crimes. "I committed murder!" "I beat up a guy almost to death!" "I feel bad for not killing him!" Look at this chump. You're denying everything. "It wasn't me, I didn't do it!" "I didn't do it!" "It was love! We loved each other!" Come at me, bastard! Let go! Stay back! Are you freaking nuts? When an adult talks, just say "Yes, sir." That's common courtesy. Get up, get up. How dare you headbutt me! My hand! You're dead meat. Goddammit! Stand back! Ma Duk-su. He hit me. I'm the victim. He hit me first. They're all witnesses. Look, bloody nose. Take him away. Kwon Yu, 30 days in isolation. I heard you headbutted Ma Duk-su. It's okay, it's okay. We don't hang out with them. We're on your side. You're sentenced to life. You can't assault him. You need to be on his good side. Like me. And him, watch out for him. He's a serial killer. He ate the man he killed. Watch out for him and Ma Duk-su. Anyway, give us some details. How old was she? Middle school? High school? School uniform or plain clothes? Come on, tell us. We have to stick together. You could die on your own! You bastard! Get him! You know what? I hate people who don't repent. You committed a crime. So you must repent and start anew. Already starting a fight... Misbehaving... Anyway, from now on... I want to see you repenting. Please don't kill us. Come on, get ready. Yes, Boss. Do it. Do what you did to the kiddie. Are you nuts? How about you guys? If you do good, I'll let you go. What? Yes. Yes! I'll do it. I'll do my best! Go on then. Let me go, you crazy bastards! My son is not a murderer! Crazy...! Grab him, grab him! -Stop moving! -Hold still! It's tough in there, isn't it? I went on... ...a one-person protest in front of the court. And I had an interview with a news magazine. And thankfully, someone contacted me. He told me he had evidence to prove your alibi. I'll meet him next week. And we're going to start the appeal process. Kwon Yu... I don't... I don't want to be a rapist's mom. I know you don't want to be a rapist either. You must stay strong and stay alive. I will... I will get you out of here. Look at him. Looks like he wants to live. Then I better help. Rub that on your wounds. You must've been an athlete. I saw you protecting your pressure points. I've been watching you. You're not the murderer type. I'm sure Ma knows you're not a rapist-murderer. Problem is, you messed with his pride. -Ma's down cold! -What? Kwon Yu, you got a visitor. Did you come alone? What about my mom? Death Certificate Lee Yeon-ok. What... What's this? I knew she was suffering. But I didn't think she'd end up like this. What are you saying? Why would she? She said she'd get me out. She told me to stay strong... Why all of a sudden...? Why? You must sign it, so we can have a funeral. She has no other relatives. So the district office offered to take care of it. But... But you won't be able to attend it. I sent a request to the authorities. But it was denied. Mom! Mom... Mom! Stay still! Kwon Yu! Drop the shiv! Don't damage your arteries, muscles or organs. Otherwise, you'll be dead. So don't stab too deep. Slide it sideways, okay? Got a plan for after? I'm going to clear my name. I promised my mom. That I would not be a rapist. Give me the key. Kwon Yu was in prison for murdering a minor. But he escaped yesterday afternoon. The police responded to a car overturn. But they found out that Kwon Yu had escape. And they published a wanted notice nation-wide. He's current whereabouts are unknown. But his uniform was recovered at a fishing site. The police found blood on his uniform. And stated that he has a serious abdomen wound. So he may not have gotten far. The police are intensifying the search in the area. They are also searching the nearby hill. And blocked all the expected escape routes. You're quite handy! -Cheongju airport. -Right, Cheongju airport. Hangzhou... Hangzhou... We're going to Hangzhou, China. Backpacking! So excited! Inspections in progress. We're doing inspections. Pass! Thank you! Thank you. No sighting at the road into town. 350 dollars. Shit car, shit car. It's day two of the hunt for Kwon Yu. The search will most likely drag on for longer. With Kwon at large, some have raised concerns... ...about additional rapes and murders. I completely forgot to bring the painting. I'm forgetful these days. Chairman Chu Sang-duk? Chairman Chu... Oh, Hyosin Group? I'll go to the crime scene tomorrow. Tell him that I'll call him after that. My painting... I'm a wanted man. So I didn't want to wonder around. Sorry I snuck in without permission. I'm sorry. Remember... When you came to visit with my mom? She mentioned... ...a person who can prove my alibi. -Alibi? -Yes. Have you met him by any chance? You didn't escape to meet him, did you? I don't know who he is. But I thought I had to see him. My Mon was preparing my appeal. It's strange that mom killed herself. I have to meet him and... It was a false tip. A prank call from some kids. She took it really badly. She said she let you down. She cried for days. In the end, she made that decision. This belonged to her. Do you recognize it? I called the police. I'll look into your case further. So just give yourself up. Kwon Yu, freeze! He's not here. KWON YU FUGITIVE KWON YU AT LARGE IS KWON YU THE REAL KILLER? Rapist and killer of a minor, Kwon Yu. An game addict who shocked the whole world. Mr Hairy? However, questions have been raised... ...about the investigation of his case. A CCTV video was submitted by the prosecution. It only has footages of Kwon Yu. Everything else in the video was removed. The prosecution said it was due to a malfunction. Kwon Yu was coincidentally captured by a black box. The prosecution didn't know about it. The car owner wanted to help arrest the criminal. So he sent it to a media outlet. But for an unknown reason, it wasn't aired. And it almost got buried in the station server. A hacker was hacking the station's servers. And came across it by chance. It shows a different story to the prosecution's. Kwon had entered and exited the motel. And it took exactly three minutes and 16 seconds. So he supposedly raped her twice. And stabbed her 31 times. Then moved the body to the washroom. And completely destroyed evidence. Is that possible? We had to track Ha Ji-su's trail before her death. So we went through her Facebook and Instagram. And found her at a club two days before her demise. It wasn't hard to find her in the club CCTV. 3 AM, she left the club with a man. And her body was found a day and a half afterwards. The man in question never became a suspect. But instead unemployed Kwon Yu was... Captain, get out of there! The manager's onto you! Hello? The fugitive... Captain, come to Namyang Cafe in Bukchang. Meet me there. Welcome. Handsome young fella. Goodbye, sweetie! This is Namyang Cafe. Mr Hairy? Is there someone named 'Captain'? Is there a 'Captain'? Is this a prank call? Eh? You're 'Captain'? Hello? Mr Hairy? Is this the right place? I just got here. Where are you? Hel... Who are you? Who are you? Did... Did Mr Hairy send you? Mr HAIRY. Hello. What's going on here? Who is this person? Is she trustworthy? -You can't just... -It's me. What? The one in front of you. Hello? I'm Mr Hairy. But your voice is... ...different. I used a voice app. It's a voice modulator. Mr HAIRY. Sit anywhere. It's safe here. Rice delivery! Leave it right there. Who could be living here? Oh no! Is this rice? Do you need this much for yourself? Where do you want it? Mr Hairy? Yeah? They'll be here soon. Don't let them see you like this. You're still Captain. That was a hike. Mr Hairy! We want some too. Extra portion for me. Looks delicious. This neighborhood makes you hungry. I almost collapsed from hunger on that hike. No CCTVs around and pretty safe too. It's worth it. Right, Captain? So are we finally having a dinner? Thank you. Oh, this. I bought some eggs on the way. The truth is... We met Mr Hairy yesterday for the first time. She never came to any get-togethers. But she called us right after hearing your escape. Come on, sit. That wasn't all. She turned my computer into a Zombie PC. And made me watch stuff. She only talks over the phone. Do you have sociophobia or something? I thought it was interesting. Your documentary. Wait, hold on. So you're all... This is Yong Guru. When the Yongsan mall fell, his business went too. He barely has a job. But he's a legendary repair technician. And this is Demolition. I'm Demolition. I work in a special effects team. You see cool stuff in movies, right? I work on those. He's a newbie. And I'm Beauty of Space. He's an architecture professor at a local college. Or so he says. So why are you all... We can't stand idle and let you get framed. We must all help! Thank you for the thought. But I can do this on my... -Come on! -Come on... That's not right at all. -We help each other. -I appreciate... I appreciate it, but I'm fine. There's a couple who couldn't make it. Cover and Conceal. Companions to the young and lonely. The leaders of online adult broadcasting. Stars in the adult industry. Did he mention where he was going? No, he didn't say. You must be a busy man. Yes, a little bit. If he calls, contact us right away. -Okay. -You can go now. Okay. Do you still have his case files? May I review them? Stop nosing around. Stick to your job. Mr Public Defender. Sure. Yes, Ms Lee. I visited the crime scene this morning. As per Chairman Chu's request. I sent you Kwon Yu's prison record to your e-mail. Kwon Yu... Ma Duk-su? Drug distribution. Attempted murder, human trafficking. Dealing weapons to gangsters... Kwon's got balls for beating him up. Moron! Look at the traffic behind you! I'll pour gasoline up your butt and light it! You impotent bastard! Take the bus, dipshit! 62N6089, 'Foul Mouth'. A common pattern? I've dissected recent violent crimes. Then I analyzed the one with similar traits. Do we have to talk on the phone? Am I the only one who thinks this is weird? So what's the common pattern? Most criminals tend to... ...conceal the evidence as much as possible. Right, that's what they all tend to do. But most important aspect in these cases is... ...that they left a crucial evidence. Like a piece in an exhibition. Wow. -Goosebumps! -Hey! The suspects get caught... All within 24 hours after the crime. Their identities get exposed before their trial. But it's not enough to be a common pattern. I think it's enough. Do you feel this? Look at this screen. I scoured CCTV videos within 1km of the motel. Around the time Captain was at the motel. And this is what I found. What about the truck? -Do you see it? -It's a composite! -What? -It's fake, look! Look at the timecode. It was fabricated so that it was there for an hour. The truck moved but someone wanted to hide it. You're right. Did you find something similar in other cases too? Who are these guys? I traced registered address on these trucks. They all belong to a junkyard in Incheon. Beauty of Space and Yong Guru were jealous of me. Because I was going with you. You're a god among us users. There! Look, look! Wow, it's really here. This is big! Mr Hairy was right. Suits in a junkyard don't feel right. I'll follow the SUV. -Can you hold the fort here? -Me? You can do it, right? Of course, you can. -Yeah? -Captain, the Audi came back. Eh? They're changing it into a fridge truck. Who are they? They're leaving. What do I do? Go after them? I don't have a car. Are you a cop? Granpa, faster! I was a marine! Captain, captain! There, it's that building. They delivered a fridge and left. I tried everything to sneak in. No strangers allowed. What do we do? I got it. Okay, Beauty of Space and Yong Guru, go. All the other technicians went home. And say they'll fix it in the morning. They're not diligent like us. People nowadays lack strong will. This is our specialist. A legend in his field. I'll go take a look. Oh yeah, I don't know if you've heard. The manager at the other building got the axe. -He did? -Yeah. He said he worked responsibly and hard, but... Yong Guru, find the main server and connect me. He wasn't just fussy. He was shameless, isn't that right? What do you think? -Do you agree? -I don't understand... Main server... main server... What I'm saying is... What was I saying? I lost my train of thought. -What's your point? -There isn't one. Well... -There isn't? -Since I was 28 or so... -28? -Yes. Well, my hair... -Your hair? -Yes. We're similar. We're similar. You're shinier than me. -What's taking so long? -Wait. A problem can't be diagnosed that quickly. Everything has to be checked and double checked. So that it doesn't happen again... It's done. But It's very easy to spot as well. Because he's an expert. -Mr Hairy, you're in. -Okay, thank you. Captain, unit 1306. 13th floor clear. It's Noh Joon-young. You know him? He was in the TV show, "Witch's Boyfriend". It was huge, so he's hot now. So that's Noh Joon-young's place? It's that one! The delivered case! Why is he dead in there? They transported a body? Life is so futile. He was a rising star. Captain, we have a guest. What are they doing? Party prep is done. Fingerprints and nails... And saliva were all over it. So it won't be easy to remove all evidence. I've put together a list of candidates. 173 in total. Unemployed and temps. Are you always so hasty? No need to hurry. We need to choose a girl, so they can start working. I'm getting nonstop calls from Chairman Chu! Stop, stop. This is not your first time. Being out of work can't be the only criteria. Jeez... Let's backtrack Noh Joon-young's steps. NOH JOON-YOUNG CREDIT CARD TRANSACTIONS BOSS? He spent a lot of time there. He was addicted to hostess bars? Alright. Let's take a look at the girls there. SO HYUN-JEONG BIG BROTHER YPN REPORTER SEO JI-SEUNG Hello? I sent you a profile. Put together a headline and a rough draft. Due tonight. That's a bit... I got other deadlines. What? You can't do it? Of course not, I'll get it done by... I'm paying you a lot. So ungrateful. The concept of today's job. "Celebrity stalking bar girl's gruesome kill". Who is it? I'm here to change the water filter. Okay. BIG BROTHER FINGERPRINT DATA SENT DENTAL LABORATORY Yes, Mr Min. Hi, Ms Lee. I need to pull someone out from prison, urgently. Urgently. I dug into the owner of the condo. His name is Chu Sang-duk. Chairman of Hyosin Group. Why did an actor die in someone else's condo? I know. No quizzes. These articles were published last year. On Noh Joon-young and Chu Ye-ri. -Chu Ye-ri? -Chairman Chu's daughter. The pieces are coming together in an interesting way. So that girl in the photo is getting framed? I know! I said no quizzes. Mr Hairy, can you find her? Do you see the print on this? They will go after her. I'll try. SO HYUN-JEONG That's pretty. How would you like it? As full looking as possible. -Shampoo time. -Okay. Captain, the bug is installed. Good job. Is it that simple? That's why you shouldn't open random texts. With one click, it's no longer your phone. Damn it. Why is your phone off? Huh? Today's collection day, did you forget? -Damn it, come here. -A few more... -Please give me a few more days! -Shut up. Give you a few more days? You don't answer me, don't pay me back! What are you looking at? Having fun? Sell your kidney if you have to! You don't deserve to live... Let go! Who the hell are you? I sent it last week. No way! I have no more money to send him! If he needs the money, he can rob houses! How could you say that about your brother? He's having a hard time. Are you yelling at me because you sent a few bucks? Little brat! Mom... Do you know how I earned that money? Don't call me again. I'm at my breaking point! Mr HAIRY. Stayed up all night? Want breakfast? It's okay, after everyone wakes up. You're still a fugitive. Don't get in other people's affairs. Mr Hairy, you're the one. You helped my mom, right? It's Yeo-wool. That's my name. Hello? Hi, I found a wallet. I'll pay you 300 dollars. It's on the bed upstairs. I found this number in the wallet. It's her. The woman who called me. Do you know the Pentaportra Condo in Cheongdam? Yes, I'll meet you there. Thank you so much. -I'll come right away. -Okay. She used the same method to lure me. We have to catch her. BAITING COMPLETE I need three minutes. Yes, how can I help you? Hello? Let go of me! Hello? It wasn't my son! Life imprisonment without parole. Hello? Are you there? Hello? What the hell... Hello? You must be tired. I understand what you're trying to do. Pervert, you like breathing into the phone? What, pervert? I'll scrape all the intestines out of your body. Intestines... Oh man... You crazy bastard. Are you really that bored? -You're a bum, right? -Yup. You're a freeloader, I can tell. So a freeloader can't even make a call? I'm sorry, Mommy. I just want to do it, is that so much to ask? Are you turned on by my dirty mouth? So dirty talk turns you on, huh? -You're the real pervert. -Dear valued perverted client. This isn't the sex hotline. You're a nasty. Piss off, slut! Hello? It's done. Wow. Hello? Is this Mr Bae Young-deuk? It's Goryeo Resources. We have a night construction job for you. Are you available? No problem. You're exposed, go off the grid. -It's him! Right? -Take a picture. Call the police. -What the hell are you doing? -Move this truck! I'm so sorry! -Back off at once! -Move it right now! Hey, rapist! Been a while, you bastard. He's coming to. -Pull him up. -Yes, boss. Stay still. Aren't you curious how I got out? Damn, I'm curious too. Remember this? You shot me with it. Here it comes. -Holy shit! -Look at that. Moron. Hold him. Kwon Yu, here it comes. Give me the knife. Cut his mouth. I'll cut your face open and bury you properly. So rest in peace, okay? Fugitive Kwon Yu! I'm calling while the fugitive's gone out. Please save me. We'll rescue you shortly. So please be calm. Boss? The cops want this bastard. Don't mind them. The guy who got me out will take care of it. Ms Lee. We got one more task. Don't take any unnecessary actions. -Chief, chief! -We'll move in shortly. The HQ ordered us to withdrawal. What? We got a hostage in there. I'm not sure, that was the order. Officer! Please! He's trying to kill me, please help me! Get in here, you stupid idiots! Execute! Execute! -What's that? -What the hell? We surrender! -We're allies. -Who are they? We're on the same side. Get in! Quickly! What happened? You left this in the middle of the road. Thanks, anyway. What's with the driving? I don't have a license. -What? -No license! Switch, I'll drive! By the way. How did the cops know my location? Hey, buddy! Match the speed, idiot! Hey, Hey! Stop the car. Let's cut your face! He's been on my ass like a hound dog. -Turn the car around! -What? Turn it around! Boss, we're on a ramp as you can see. Turn it around, dumbass! What? What's that? Radio detector. Yong Guru made it. Why is that in there? Wait, wait! Hold on. We lost his signal there, so search thoroughly. Once you catch Kwon Yu, you'll be a free man. So you got me out to bury Kwon Yu. Wow, this guy. -You're pretty powerful... -Focus on catching Kwon Yu. Or you'll be sent back to the joint. He hung up. So he gave you your mother's necklace. But it contained a location tracker? And those gangsters were supposed to be in prison? Without Mr Hairy, you would be in a grave. So who really is that lawyer? Shouldn't we go after the lawyer first? Yong Guru, can you... Can you make drones? Drone? So, how's the feed? Good, very clear. Oh, wait. Leather... Is that new? Mr Hairy bought it for me. Yeah? Yong Guru's pretty amazing at this. Yong Guru, you're awesome. I can't believe this guy is unemployed, man. That leather smell... My dad beat me up for playing like this. MIN CHUN-SANG I reviewed the raised estimate. And transferred the money to the operatives. Okay, good work. We can hear what they're saying in the office. It's using laser to detect soundwaves. That's the standard now. We completed your request. All leaked documents are destroyed. Related data are stored securely for insurance. You know about Kwon Yu's escape, right? He's already been here. Take care of it before it becomes a problem. -If it goes wrong... -Attorney Min is... He's more capable than we imagined. Please calm the board for me. Long conversation could be compromising. See you at the meeting. Attorney Min Chun-sang. So that idiot is the puppet master? So he forms schemes in a beat-up office like that? Is that possible? He needs a massive server farm. That place looks unlikely. Maybe they have one off-site. Yong Guru, did you bring the metal scanner? Send in another drone. Let's scan the building. Shit, what's this he's hiding? It's like a huge safe. They built a fortress. It means they got secrets they want to protect. Can't Mr Hairy hack it and get the information? Like you did to us that time. You can turn it into a Zombie PC. I've been trying. But I can't penetrate the firewall. Dammit. Everything would be solved once we're inside. Beauty of Space, got any ideas? No one gets inside unless someone opens the door. It's impossible. Let's just call the cops. What if they're on their side? Then get the media involved. Did Mr Hairy's video get any air time? She's in hiding because it put her on a watchlist. I have an idea. Hello? We have a problem. -What is it? -The crime scene is messed up. You're finished, Min Chun-sang. They wiped all fingerprints. And mixed various hair samples. We can't tell which belongs to her. He's funny. How could you laugh? The news will be out tomorrow. What now? Let's push back the D-Day. Get the operatives to wipe this place down. Move Noh Joon-young to somewhere quiet. A motel in the country, perhaps. And collect So Hyun-jeong's samples again. Dad, any updates from that Min Chun-sang guy? How long do I have to stay here? The food is shit and I can't bear the stench! Min Chun-sang! -Is this how you work? -Chairman Chu! Do you know how much pain my daughter is in? I raised her like a princess. We're all working day and night. So please be patient with us. Pay me back! Huh? Give me my money! What the hell? Everything pisses me off. Who the hell! Okay, try it. One, two, three! WE KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING. What the hell? Crazy bastard! Stop it, please! Kwon Yu is going after all our operatives. We can hire new people. Do you want Chairman Chu's nagging to continue? Let's finish So Hyun-jeong first. No need to worry about Kwon Yu. I have him under control. It's time for the news. Let's watch together. I'm here at an unmanned motel in Yesan. Noh Joon-young, an actor, was missing for a week. But we received a tip that he was murdered. And we're now at the scene. Right now, at the crime scene... -Come one! -You can't come in here! -Move aside! Move! -Let us through! It's Chu Ye-ri! Camera on her! -Ms Chu! -Ms Chu! Ms Chu, say something! -Tell us what happened! -Ms Chu! ACTOR NOH JOON-YOUN'S BODY FOUND IN A MOTEL How long do I have to stay here? The food is shit and I can't bear the stench! Chu Ye-ri, daughter of Hyosin Group Chairman... ...was sleeping at the crime scene. And was arrested for murdering Noh Joon-young. The forensics... What the hell's going on? Why was my daughter there? Chu Hye-ri's father, Chu Sang-deuk. He's also taking a wave of criticism. Now he's facing the greatest threat of his life. UNKNOWN CALLER Kwon Yu? Did you like it? I copied your method. Good, that was quite amazing. Being complimented by someone I want to kill. It feels weird. I mean it. To tell you the truth... It's been pretty dull recently. I got a surge of motivation, it excites me. It's been a long time. Can you understand that? This was quite fun in the beginning. I would create some scenarios. And involve some guys and put them in jail. Then I'd write an article. It'd make the whole country... ...laugh. And they'd cry. And they'd get angry. The sense of accomplishment... So what? It's still a job and it gets dull after a while. Everything's the same. But I'm ecstatic lately. You're coming at me. No one has ever challenged me before. But you're coming after me. It pisses me off, but it also feels amazing! Hello? How dare he hang up when I'm talking. He hung up... What a douchebag. This is the problem. Can't communicate with the young ones. Not at all. It's quite serious. Can't communicate! I didn't ask for much! Did I ask for much? You and I were on the phone! On the Phone! I was talking! Can't communicate! Stupid bastards! Can't communicate! That hurts really, really bad. That really hurts... Are you still asleep? Get up! Were you up all night playing games? -How about a dojo? -No more taekwondo. I'll set it up for you. I'll never practice taekwondo ever again. Please read this, my son is not a killer! Please read this. Isn't that fun? Please read this. It gets better towards the end. Oh, and sorry for killing your mom. I know it's late. I apologize. Calm down and listen to me... Listen to me. It's important... Wait! Wait! It's really important, you'll regret it. Hey! Know why this happened to you? You were born to terrible parents. Bastard! I know you feel wronged. But that doesn't excuse you... ...from hitting an older man. Have some manners. You psycho... Anyway, it's almost time. Mr HAIRY. You should answer it. Yeo-wool? Hello? -Please, please... -It's very nice to see you! Team name: RESURRECTION. Yong Guru. Demolition. And her name is... Mr Hairy. They're all going to die because of you. I... If you touch them, I will kill you. Sorry for returning a threat with a threat. But if you keep this up, they'll all die. I think my ribs are broken. I knew you'd come to steal my data. That's why I sent Mr Ma after your team. The server is huge. It'll take about 30 minutes. But you'll be a free man with that, though. Good for you. But your friends will die like dogs. Too bad. I'll kill you first. And rescue my teammates. I feel your determination. But I need to call Ma Duk-su in 15 minutes. Because I told him to kill them all if I don't. Maybe I shouldn't have. Just take the data. You escaped to clear your name. So you should get on with that. Forget them. No one cares if they die. They all eventually... I forgot to mention something else. Sorry. That friend of yours, Mr Hairy. Yoon Yeo-wool. She'll be So Hyun-jeong's replacement. They're probably gathering her samples by now. Mr Hairy! "Hikikomori hacker murders Noh Joon-young." The news will hit the web in the morning. Pretty cool, huh? I might be a genius. Stop it. Stop it! And your remaining friends. I ordered Ma Duk-su to kill them right away. Please don't kill me. I did tell him to kill them now. So don't go there. Just run away. You'll only see their corpses when you get there. Don't do it! You bastard! You shouldn't have touched me. You know why you're up there, yeah? Yeah? Who should I kill first? -Wait, please! -Wait, wait! Old man, you first. Beauty of Space! He's not dead? What's with this? Wait! Let's talk! Let's talk! Wait! What is this? You never served in the military. Wait! Hot! Mr Hairy! Get rid of her. Hurry up! Don't do it! Bastards! Give me your gun. Idiot! Wait! Please! Talk! Let's talk! Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! We can talk about this! Look at me! You bastard! Crazy bastard! Look at me! You idiot! Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Bastard! Can't concentrate, shut! You want to die first? I have a lone mother... Okay. You still die first. Wait, wait, mister, please just wait! What? What's going on? I think it's a blackout. Damn, blackout? Over there! Stop! Stop shooting! Hey! Stop shooting! Light your lighter. Is he dead? Did you find him? Hurry! Hurry! Beauty of Space, hurry! Stop right there! Get him, the one in the leather jacket! -Stop! -Get him! Faster! Faster! -Go after them! -Get them! They're behind us! Why are they fleeing if he fights so damn well? Car, car, car, car! -No, no! -It's too narrow! No! No! Let's go! Come on! That's the best you can do? -Call Yong-pal. -What? Call Yong-pal, idiot! Move the car! Hey, Mr Ma! I'll send you Kwon Yu's location. So please get him, I'm begging you. Boss! I'm here! I brought Yong-pal! I'm catch you no matter what! That looks fun. Why don't I give him a hand? It's the Foul Mouth. What the hell? How about a roller coaster ride? Yong-pal, go! Go! Go, go! Go! There, there! Over there! Careful, careful! Where am I? What's that? What are those?

You're a genius! Are we going to be okay? We're almost there. While fugitive Kwon was incarcerated... He was known to regularly assault fellow inmates. He indulged in violence.

Killer of the Century. The truth about Kwon Yu. It's brought to you exclusively on 69 Enter. He brutally murdered Noh Joon-young. Is this the truth? My daughter had a trouble. He's an actor named Noh Joon-young. I think he's a goner. Isn't that Hyosin Group's Chairman? Daddy, I'm hungry. And that bitch killed Noh Joon-young. Then... Was Kwon Yu's rape-murder true? My son made a mistake. He must've been drunk. He's prone to mistakes at his age. Even killing. You must be anxious before the big day. -Isn't this you? -What? The one who killed Ha Ji-su was Councilor Park's son. Councilor Park wrote the Kwon Yu Bill. But Kwon Yu was arrested instead. Did you see the news? Will Kwon reach the trial? I'm Min Chun-sang. Bastards! "Bastards." I'm reaching my boiling point. This is news! Ms Lee... Ms Lee? Aren't you curious who the puppet master is? I was arguing with my wife and... Her body will be found in Jamsil tomorrow. Inside a container. What are you guys doing? What have you done? Min! You saved my neck! Thank you! Hey, that was an amazing idea. How should I pay you? My office manager will contact you soon. Mr Min, you're a genius. Yes, I may be one. You're a natural born. Detectives, please, I'm so sorry! He should be torn to bits. Now. ...Involve some guys... ...put them in jail. Then I'd write an article. The whole country... Min Chun-sang is the bastard behind all this. This is the guy who deserves to die. Stop it! We'll release this data on the web first. So anyone who was framed, help yourself. And officers, grab Min before he takes off! How dare they challenge me? The wheel... Min Chun-sang, I took your wheel, moron. What do we do? He's completely exposed. Don't worry, he's replaceable. It's better to lose 10 criminals... ...than convicting one wrong person. You know better now, right? Anyone can be framed. That concludes today's news. I'm your sexy baby, Cover. Okay! Very good! Uncuff me. Mr Ma! Good to see you! It's him? Guys, what are you doing? Don't do that. Kwon Yu, who was framed and jailed for murder... ...was cleared of all charges. He became a free man. In regards to this case... Opinions on acquittal and compensation... ...for the wrongly convicted are being gathered. To discuss the ways to prevent these convictions. The real killer of Ha Ji-su was Park Jae-hyun. Park Jae-hyun was hiding in a motel. But he was arrested after 40 days... They all said the tree was rotten. But I... I told them the tree wasn't rotten. That night... I had a dream. And so... In the dream, I saw the tree. Grow strong towards the blue sky. I gathered everyone again. And told them the tree wasn't rotten. The tree... ...isn't rotten. FABRICATED CITY
