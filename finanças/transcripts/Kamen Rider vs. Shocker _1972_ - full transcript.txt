Sekai no heiwa wo mamoru tame Go! Go! Let's Go! With my shining machine... Kagayaku machine Rider Jump! Rider Kick! Kamen Rider, Kamen Rider Rider, Rider! Rider Jump! Rider Kick! Kamen Rider, Kamen Rider Rider, Rider! Daidouji Geophysics Research Institute Kamen Rider VS Shocker Original subs by XIG Fansubs Ano, the experiment was a great success! A big congratulations, professor. Thanks. If this artificial gravity device GX is enlarged, it could even alter the earth's axis. But wouldn't it be a disaster if this were used for evil purposes? That's right. It would be easy to force the world into submission. Let's go process the experiment data. All right. We'll enter the data into the computer. Get it ready. Will do. Ano, hurry and pick up the experiment report pages! - Okay! A power outage? Probably due to the lightning? Professor Daidouji! I congratulate you for completing your research. Who is it? Who is it? We Shocker have been patiently waiting for the results of your research. Who the hell are you? Doctor Death, Commander of Shocker's Japan branch. Shocker is grateful to you for handing your research over. I won't hand it over! Run, Ano! Hurry and run! Okay... What's the matter, Ano? Ano! Professor! Help! What's going on? You shall not escape. By altering the Earth's axis, Shocker will be able to rule the world. Ano! Ano! Return Ano! Return him! Begin constructing the artificial gravity device from the data at once. We will alter the earth's axis, and sink Japan into the bottom of the sea! May I say something, Doctor Death? What is it? The most important part, the GX equation, is missing from this data. What? I see. Damn it! So that scoundrel Daidouji hid this crucial portion? Shocker does not give up just like that! I cannot hand it over! I put my blood, sweat and tears into that research. No way I'd give it up to benefit a world domination conspiracy! Hey! Help! Ano! Ano! Ano! Hang on! Are you all right? Ano! Ano! Ano! Professor. Are you all right? That must have been horrible. I'm sorry. We've got to get you to a hospital. It must have been hard to escape. I'm so glad that you're okay. Well... When they learned that the GX equation was missing from the data they stole... ...I took that chance and escaped. Pr-professor... Just where did you hide the GX equation? Actually, I entrusted it to my daughter Tamami just in case. Tamami... Ano? Who are you? I am Fly Man! Good job blurting out the truth! Daidouji, we have no more use for you! Help! Help! You will not escape! Please! I only ask that you spare my daughter Tamami! Just spare Tamami! Spare my daughter! Spare her! Only if you obediently hand the secret of GX over. Wait, Shocker! Do not say it! It's you, FBI brat! This way! Shocker! We'll protect Professor Daidouji! Why the hell are you here, Ichimonji Hayato? The FBI headquarters deciphered your encrypted transmission! Targeting Professor Daidouji's research in order to flood the Earth, aren't you? Get them! Taki, take care of the Professor! All right! Hurry! Wait! Come at me, Ichimonji Hayato! So you're here too! Saboteguron and Mogurang! Transform! Let's go, Shocker cyborgs! How dare you do that to our comrades! Come at me, Fly Man! Rider Kick! Hayato! We made it just in the nick of time, didn't we? It's all right now, Professor. No, it's too late. It might be too late. Why? Why is it too late? I already told them that the secret of my research is with my daughter. Your daughter? Daidouji Thank you for coming, everyone. Tamami-kun, here's something on behalf of everyone. Happy birthday! Congratulations! Thank you! But don't you feel lonely without your father here? Tamami's father is a famous scientist, so it can't be helped. It's fine. I've gotten used to it. Even though Papa didn't come, I still have lots of friends who did. Also, he didn't forget, and sent me a present. See? Your doll is wonderful, but the cake must be too! Oh, sorry! So, I'll have to cut it. Don't you have to blow the candles first? Hey, draw the curtains. It will glow nicely in the dark! Blow it all out with one breath! So, here goes! It's on fire! Everyone get out of here! W- What are you doing? It won't open! What's wrong with it? No choice! Get out through the window! Hurry! Oh no! Shocker cyborgs! Let go! Arigabari and Dokuganda, aren't you? Damn you! Let go! Help! No! It hurts! Let go! Damn you! Let go! - You brat! Let go! Damn it... Hurry! Hey, sleeping on the job, huh? Hey! He's unconscious. Who the hell? Hongo Takeshi! Shocker cyborgs! Leave that girl behind and retreat obediently! Silence! We'll take your life if you get in our way! I'll show you what happens when you defy me! Here I go! Transform! Kamen Rider! Don't move! Got it? Help, Rider! Help! You're a new cyborg? A man-eating salamander from the Japanese Alps, and my name is Zanjioh! The girl is ours, Kamen Rider! Get him! Die! Let go! Oh, Ichimonji! The girl is ours! Help... Damn it! He got away with the Professor's daughter. What a dreadful Shocker cyborg. Please cheer up a little. Even the Chief has such a grave face. They'll get Tamami back for sure! A parent's concern for his child is something immeasurable. But you all probably do not understand that yetƒ. They're back! W- What happened? He suffered a light concussion, that's all. Goro. Damn it! Blasted Shocker! What about the Professor's daughter? We were too late. What? She was taken by Shocker. As we feared... Yes, this is Tachibana Racing Club. To whom— What? Doctor Death? You better tell this to Professor Daidouji. If he values his daughter's life... ...then he will hand over the GX equation. We will do the exchange... ...in Hell Valley... ...at noon tomorrow. Shocker! I've brought Professor Daidouji! Are you going to return Tamami? Thanks for coming, Ichimonji Hayato. We will perform the hostage exchange in the middle of the valley. On the count of three, we will begin walking! If you try anything funny, we'll kill the girl! One! Two! Three! Go. Tamami! Tamami! Papa! Tamami! Ichimonji Hayato. Did you think that Shocker would simply let you leave like this? Look! You fell right in the middle of our trap! Mukaderas! Turtle Stone! Armadillong! Slugzilla! Zanbronzo! Egyptas! Ghoster! Unicornos! Crab Bubbler! Wolf Man! Todogira! Poison Dahlian! Hell Thunder! Spider Man! Gamagira! Dokuganda! Yamogeras! Ray King! Snowman! Scorpion Man! Sea Anemone! Bat Man! Aconitum! Geba Condor! Chameleon! Arikimedes! Musasabidol! Sarracenian! It does not matter if you are immortal. You do not stand a chance against our great army! Have you gone mad, Ichimonji Hayato? Doctor Death. It seems that you were so over-confident in your plan that it blurred your vision. Have a good look at the Professor Daidouji you have! What? Now! Doctor Death. You will accompany us until the three of us reach a safe place. You... You planned this, didn't you, Hongo Takeshi? Tell that dangerous pack of monsters to get out of our sight! - Now... - Hongo... - Let's go. - Let's take a walk, shall we? Are you all right? Hold on tight! Okay! Damn it! Wait! None of you will leave alive! Damn it. Damn it! Tamami! Damn it! Don't be afraid, Tamami! Keep your eyes closed no matter what happens, okay? Okay. I'll do like you say! All right. Transform, Hongo! All right! Transform! Transform! Rider Hammer Kick! There you are, Shocker cyborgs! Hayato, leave them to me! Will he be all right alone? Rider! Taki! Good timing! Take care of her! All right! Let's go! All right! Rider Kick! Let's go! All right. Have you prepared yourself, Riders? Get them! Ichimonji. Hongo. Let's do this. Get them! We've gotten rid of all of them. Strange. Zanjioh wasn't with them. All right, let's go! Tamami! Papa! I was so scared! But I persevered for you, Papa. I'm sorry. I put you in so much danger just because of my research. Professor, about your research... In what way did you leave the secret with your daughter? Actually, it's in the doll I gave Tamami as her birthday present. In a doll? So, where's that doll? It's at home. What? Kamen Rider! I cannot let you have the doll! Give me the doll! Never! Ichimonji Hayato is here too! When we were attacked, you were missing. That meant that you were secretly following us to get the secret of GX! Get them! Hongo! Damn it! Hongo! After him! You'll not escape, Zanjioh! Let's go! How's that, Riders? Die, Riders! Over there, Hongo! All right! Rider Double Kick!
