Digital restoration of image and sound performed by MOSFILM Cinema Concern MOSFILM Creative Association of musicals and comedies GOOD SOULS Based upon the play of the same name by L. Zorin Institute of Antique Culture - Hi. - Hi. - Hi. - Hi. There you are, our hero of the day Gordei Kabachkov. I'm not picking at you, Lozhkin, so don't you pick at me. Mind your own business. My congrats – you invented something that didn’t exist. Very funny. You said that ancient Greeks played on citharas? What a discovery! Do you know the difference between Telemachus and telegraph? - Hi. - Hi. The telegraph is around the corner. - Nikolai Ivanovich. - What? Will you come to the viva voce tomorrow? So spake he, and did on his fair armor. "And now Menelaus, would the end of life have appeared for thee at the hands of Hector, seeing he was mightier far, had not the kings of the Achaeans sprung up and laid hold of thee." And Atreus' son himself, wide-ruling Agamemnon, caught him by the right hand and spake to him, saying: "Thou art mad, Menelaus, and this thy madness beseemeth thee not. Hold back, for all thy grief." Homer was incredible. A very ingenuous person. He was also famous for his naivety. A genius is always naive. Though, not all naive people are geniuses. Last night I read the episode about Teucer fighting against the Lycian hero Glaucus. Though, Teucer would not cope with our Kabachkov. That's a difficult dilemma. So, at last, it will happen tomorrow. A momentous event. I didn't believe in him to the lost. Then why did you offer his thesis for defence? But still I didn't believe in him. In fact Kabachkov is a hapless fellow. Don't be so compassionate. No reason to get so excited. Kabachkov is not such a big figure, after all. A very difficult case. And it happens every blessed day. The director's post is an ordeal. My daughter persuaded me. - And she did the right thing. - Why? You are lucky to be under the influence of a woman. Men are neither fish nor flesh. Only women can show a strategy - some definite direction. Yaroslav Borisovich, there will be no car for you. - Your daughter is using it. - It's all right, I'll walk on foot. Fresh air and physical activity are good for my health. - Here. - Thank you. Well, that's all for today. - Ah, it's you. - Hi, Orest Ivanovich. - Hi. - Is Gordei at home? Oh, your precious one. Yes, he's here. Sleeping. You don't seem to be in good moods. And why should I be in good moods? So what if I'm in bad moods. This is ridiculous. You're such a rude person, you know. All right, so what if I'm rude? But what about your Gordei? Going on about his thesis for three years on end. For Crissake! He once told me he won't get a scientific degree. What a fool I am, after all! Going all so sentimental about having met a country fellow man. So what he is my country fellow man? I fussed over him like a brainless hen: a young scientist writing a dissertation, without a corner where to live. But everything is not to his liking. If so, why can’t he leave? You didn't eat anything? Of course I didn't. Tell me: is there any hope? Leave that cucumber alone, no one is going to steal it from you. I can’t even eat normally. The enviers all around me. Leave him alone. Honey, what's the news? Lozhkin is conspiring something against me. For shame - he is newly married! I thought marriage improves people. Only prison can improve the kinds of Lozhkin. Don't lose your heart, honey. Your thesis was included into the schedule. It's half of the victory. I'm sure they won't dare to dump you. Jesus... They will dare without a problem. If it were open voting, as normally it should be, they wouldn't dare. But secret voting gives me no chance. Should they vote openly, in my presence, there could be some hope. But now they’ll do their dirty job secretly. Nothing can be worse than secret voting. It's an atavism. It’s not serious – it’s like in gambling. Like a game. There is something hostile in all this. Why should Soviet people be so secretive? They should vote openly, with an open heart. Otherwise it smacks of an intrigue. You're absolutely right. Now you see how noble his thoughts are? Oh yes, he is so full of thoughts indeed. But he'd be better full of some knowledge. Oh, zip your lip. You are like Lozhkin. Sorry for being so blunt, but right now you said something outrageous. You think that I... I wish him good with all my heart! But you, the office manager of the institute, a woman with a certain authority, what did you do to support him? I did everything I could. I pulled strings for him. Put I should keep appearances. It's not polite to emphasize our relations. Oh, yes, not polite. Everyone's keeping appearances. But is it polite to freeload off me? I'm such a convenient person, eh. I'm warning you officially: if he doesn't become a candidate of sciences, I will... I will turn him out of my doors! I got you pegged a long time ago! You don't care for people - you care for their success! But remember: there will be another door that will open for him. I will be the one who will save you. You can't imagine what a loving woman can do. Okay now, let's remember the members of the scientific council. - To hell with them. - No, wait. Let's name them one after another. The director. Of course, he is a famous scientist, but he plays by his daughter's rules. Anyutin is a knowledgeable person naïve like a child. - Kolesnitsyn. - A badmouth. He only pretends being a badmouth, but I know that he is kind. Vitalyev. He is indifferent to everything. You will easily win him onto your side. - There are 19 members! - Yes, 19. And you will go to each of them, and you will tell them... Gordei Petrovich? I didn't recognize you. It's a good sign. Means you'll earn a fortune. Fortune is nothing. - What? - Fortune is nothing. I know what is going to happen tomorrow. - What? - I've nothing to hope for. My dear man, of course your work has many drawbacks... - It can't be helped. - What? Do what you must, come what may. Ah, yes, of course. - But look at my road. - What road? At the road that I passed. I'd gladly look at it. I never knew parent's love. - I was born in an orphanage. - Where? In an orphanage. In other words, I'm an orphan. There were 150 other orphans like me. - What? - 150 orphans. Since a boy, I was enchanted by science. Though uneducated, I strove towards science. - Did I upset you? - No. No. I won’t upset you anymore. I worked honestly and made visible products. But tomorrow is my execution day. - What?! - Execution! - God bless my soul... - There will be 19 'nays'. Arkady Glebovich, if only I could hope for at least one 'yeah'. Yes. At least one 'yeah'. It won't decide anything. But thus I will be spared all this disgrace. Sorry, but the door wasn't locked. You are Gordei Pavlovich, if I'm not mistaken? You mean you remember me? - Of course I do. - So do I. I remember you wearing a black sleeveless dress at that party. Come on in. Merci. In fact, I came to your father Yaroslav Borisovich, but I'm glad you're here. I badly need your piece of advice. - And get it you will. - Thank you. Thank you very much. They are spinning a plot against me, Iraida, - can you imagine that? - How interesting. Go on. The instigator is Lozhkin - well, you know him. He created a stifling atmosphere for me. And in such an atmosphere I am to present my work, my brainchild. I understand. I'm an author, too. You're a woman. You can be a mother. - Oh, please... - What I mean... Imagine my feelings when I know what things can befall my brainchild. I mean my dissertation. Of course, I'm not a genius, and my work has certain drawbacks and some points of argument. Show them to me, help me to correct them, right? Instead of destroying me. Remember, Gordei Petrovich: a thinking person needs to fight. Are you ready to fight? Yes. Then here is my hand. Oh, my God, how strong it is. - Sorry. - It's all right. This is what a man should be like. Why didn't you come sooner? I was inviting you. I thought it was just a figure of speech. Also Lozhkin is paying visits to you all the time. Forget about Lozhkin. He got married. He seems to be so happy at home that he keeps coming here. What surrounds him there? Routine. But played here is a vibrant intellectual game. A poignant atmosphere. But hey, you are tragically ambitious. You are so, you know... I didn't pronounce it, though. The message is only on my eyelashes. On my eyelashes. Make me your envoy. And, lastly, I want to thank everybody for making me the way I am today. First of all I'm very grateful to our most respected director Yaroslav Grebeshkov and also Filipp Kolesnitsyn, Evgeny Vitalyev, Elizaveta Sycheva, Arkady Anyutin, Ivan Sidorov, Nikolai Trofimov, Georgiy Zubov and many others. Thank you for your attention. It was something... I can’t believe it’s happening… Let's go and vote. In my mind, his speech was very meaningful and... he thanked everybody. Very well, but, supposing there will be nine 'nays' and ten 'yeahs’. Hi. You are like a Sistine Madonna today, Nadezhda Pavlovna - giving away your baby to the humankind. And you are his enemy. I'm not even a member of the council and have no right of blackballing him. Did I forget to thank someone else? You were charming. Look at the opponents - they are like tigers hungry for a piece of meat. Forget about them. They don't decide anything. I'm surrounded by enviers. So what. I know you'll never bend before them. An oak tree doesn't bend - it just falls down. Look at me. Demoniac eyes. - I must go now. - I bless you. Or, say, nine 'nays', one 'yeah' and one abstention. Did I thank everybody? Except me. I listened to you for 40 mins. Be off. Did I omit someone? As if I know their whole list. Calm down, you didn't omit anyone. That devil Lozhkin is spinning intrigues. So what? Life goes on. Just in case, we'll leave to my relatives in Rostov. Be quiet. They can hear us. Come in, comrades. Unanimous! Unanimous against me? Unanimous in your favor, dammit. We are neck-high in manure, my dear friends. Some ignoramus, some empty-headed hillbilly cheated us learned people. Arkady Glebych, how come you voted in his favor? What else was I supposed to do? A young man was standing in front of me so eager to embrace science. Yes, he is talentless, but it is his tragedy - not his blame. I just couldn’t turn my back on him. You're nothing but a liberal. Elizaveta Sergeevna, you are such a decisive woman, dealing with fierce dogs. What happened to you? - I’m like wax. - See? I'm so easily moved to pity. What can I demand from men? My demands to them - are not so strict. - Really? Yes. Also I was afraid my harsh tone could make him cry. Even the ironical Evgeny Evgenyevich gave in. but he was begging on his knees! And I thought – let him have at least one ‘yeah’ if he wants it so much. Just for a change. And what about our inquisitive Filipp Filippovich? You laid an egg, too, my dear sir. That fellow was so full of self-humiliation, that I thought: to hell with him. We have put ourselves in a shameful situation. All of us, forgetting about our own work, put together his thesis, licked it into shape. Yes we did. Because should someone have read that work in its ‘primordial’ state, our institute would have stopped existing. Abd we dedicated our lives to it. Someone published an opinion about his thesis. We turned into swindlers, that's where we landed. Take it easy, Filipp Filippovich. Of course we made a mistake. We just took a pity on him. One shouldn't be ashamed of his kindness. But we should part with him. He’ll see that he can't stay here any longer, and we'll soon forget about this incident. - You're a real Diogenes! - A giant of thinking! Besides, he stopped quoting Achilles’ heel as belonging to Hercules. - What a progress! - He's almost an academician now! Nature and sun! I feel so exhilarated! I want you to drive a car. Cars become you. Once I drove a car, but they didn't give me the license. License is not to be given but taken! Gosh… I'll catch you! I'll catch you! I'll catch you! Hi, Nadezhda Pavlovna. - Is Yaroslav Borisovich here? - He is busy. It's for you. - Take it away. You are his enemy. - But not yours. It's one and the same thing. I don't understand what you can have against him. Everyone accepted him but you. The voting proved that much. See this postcard? Someone hasn't seen him for several years and still can't forget him. Hi, Gordei. I was amazed to read an article about you. I'm shifting things around. Hope to see you one day. Mitrofan Tikhodonsky. That's a very touching fact. By the way, I saw your hero today. In a car with the director's daughter. I'm not interested in the least. - When did you see him? - Two hours ago. - Hi. - Hi. - Hi. - Hi. - Hi. - Hi. See? He is seething with malice. Nevermind him. You having joy rides? Why not? We are cultured people. - She's bad company. - It's my own business. - Here. - What is it? - Who is that Mitrofan? - One fool. Anything else? They are planning something against you. Too late. I have them all in my fist. Imagine: instead of my manuscript they will publish his. He pulled some strings. Maybe it's someone from his family. He doesn't have any family. Greetings to everyone. Gordei Petrovich. Welcome. How are you, Gordei Petrovich? Merci, I'm fine. As your senior colleagues, we'd like to know about your plans for the future. What I mean is how you see it. There can be no plans at such a difficult period of time except to work side by side with you, zealously. We discussed the situation. You should extend your horizons. And maybe leave to some other institute. Thanks for caring so much, but I'm happy with the scientific milieu that I have now - May I, Yaroslav Borisovich? - Speak up. Listen, young man, can't you see that you should leave? I don't understand. You cheated us, dear sir. I? No person in his right mind would have voted for you. You all voted following you scientific and civil conscience. You're a crafty type, as I can see, Kabachkov. You think we'll slave on you to the end of our lives? My dear sir, I believe that you are an honest person. Let us part our ways on friendly terms. No way. You think I'm an idiot? You have a vacancy. My thesis became popular. The press called me a worthy successor. My dissertation will be published. Also I love our institute. I grew up here. Grew up? Recently I talked to comrade Ivanov, and he said to me: "Don't even think about it. "We turned you into a scientific authority, "so continue you work here." "If you want to leave our city," - he said, "it means you don't love it and that you're a deserter." And then I realized it would be a mistake to leave from here. Do you mean that comrade Ivanov knows the real state of things? Tell him, if you wish. It's up to you. You're grown-up people. Only I don't want to upset you. I owe you all. And should we part one day, I'll keep gratitude in my heart forever, saying on every possible occasion about you guys who helped me to rise in this world. Your humble servant... I treated them with my dessert. - Will you come tonight? - No. I will be busy. I wish you didn't defend that foolish thesis of yours. What? My thesis became very popular! I was gravely mistaken in you, Nadezhda Pavlovna. I don't want a whiff of him anymore. We shouldn't suffer the presence of this ruffian. Really, that man is real bewildering. The essence of a true mind lies in seeing all proportions. After all, what is this Kabachkov? Where is he? Give me a microscope - I want to see that microbe. Just imagine: our huge country of 250 mln people is striding wide along the road of scientific progress. What's the role of Kabachkov in this historical process? Let that wretched creature stay here. Let him come here once in a fortnight, we don't care. Why should I see him at all? He makes me sick. Be sensible. He'd better remain under our control. Our position was far from being impeccable. - Right. - He's right. We'd better keep an eye on him. He's a corny guy with an attachment towards the institute. I even feel pity for him. It was us who let it happen. It's not his blame that he is a freak of Nature. Dear comrades. It is three years since Aristarkh Vikentyevich finished his earthly existence. He was a subtle friend, a wise teacher and a principled scientist. My dear man, it goes beyond all limits: you scribbled three huge articles one after another! - I can't keep silent. - But you're not Leo Tolstoy! We had to put our own work aside to rewrite that crap. Right. Because should someone else have read it in its primitive, so to say, form, we would have been turned into a laughing stock. Can't you just sit quiet and not stick out? Yes, sit quiet. As simple as that. But I need to grow. Also I need money because I'm going to get married. We couldn't care less about your personal life. - Are you kidding? - Not at all. - I'm a member of a collective. - Dammit, I asked you to settle everything in a civilized way. - Very well. - Without quarrelling. - Right. - What do you suggest? I've a variant, a compromise. Please explain. Maybe I'm more apt as an organizer. Reasonable enough. As an administrator, I will excel better. Make me deputy director, - and everyone will be happy. - I see. - What?! - You must be crazy! - But it's the best variant. - He's sick with megalomania! Mania grandiosa. You'll consult me all my life. - Consult you? - I'll bear the entire brunt. I thought you'll thank me for this. - Oh, yes, we will. - Stop it. There is nothing more I can do for you. You know what I'm dreaming about? No. I want to go far, far away with you! On a float-boat, along a free-flowing river, away from the street noise and all these familiar faces. I imagine a bamboo grove. - And Gordei, the Great King... - Stop it! Enough. Stop it. Here. Have a smoke. You know, now it's sink or swim for me. My life is at stake. It's a cross on my chest, or a cross in the ground. Yes, I'm a wanton woman, a bacchante... Stop it, for Crissake! Gordei! What do we do? He will go on - scribbling his crap. - Oh, God forbid. Not so much time is left for me. I want to accomplish something of my own. - What? - I mean, life is short. What a scoundrel, thanking us for every line re-written. He put us into fetters. I think that we should accept his proposal. Yes, take it easy: we must accept it. Let him do organizational things - he certainly has a business vein. At least he'll leave us alone. Arkady Glebovich is right: we are old, and we have a lot of things to finish. Damn... Maybe you are right. Should we thwart him, he’ll flood us with complaints. But let's agree: we must keep him 100 miles away from scientific matters. I will take care of this. We are getting married, Father. Well, it's up to you. I already signed your appointment. Hopefully, you'll make more progress as an administrator rather than as a scientist. And because we are family now, I can't remain a director. And this fact makes me happy. I’m a scientist, not a director. Well, be happy and so on. Good news can be shocking, too. Oh, yeah, the old man is moved to the quick. Oh, you are brimming with energy. I will call you 'Man my friend'. All right. Then I, on my part... I'll submit to your every demand. You will filter all the callers here. Yes, of course. Enough is enough. I'm sick and tired of you. My dear Gordei... Of course, you are a big person now, so high up we can't reach you. But let me tell you, for old acquaintance's sake: you have chosen the wrong road. - It'll lead you to... - Gordei... Let's go to Rostov. If you leave me, you'll never be happy. Everything is over with Rostov at this stage. And, as a woman of business, you know that we can't work together now. Do I need to teach you all the time? One day, you'll remember and say: "Orest Goodmanov was right!" Thanks for giving me a shelter. You were such a pest, but no ill feelings. Farewell, Orest. My comb... That's all, it seems. Good afternoon. What's going on, Yaroslav Borisovich? You know, my daughter is getting married to my deputy, so to say. I mean Herodotus Petrovich. - It's Gordei. - Right. Gordei. And I can't remain on this post under these circumstances. What will happen now? Kabachkov will be the acting director. And I'm glad of this fact. I’m a scientist, not a director. Will you excuse me. Well, well, Kabachkov. you are making a too quick progress. I wish I knew what you were before that 'blessed' day when you came here. Bobruisk, central post office, to be called for To Mitrofan Tikhodonsky Who is waiting for a call from Syktyvkar - please proceed to booth 3. What? A car? Walk on foot, it's not so far away. What impossible people! Can’t walk on foot, eh. - Gordei Petrovich. - Who is there? It's me Vitalyev. Sit down. What's up? You put a veto on the theme of my work. I'm between sky and earth. So, and what is the theme of your work? 'Ideological basis of myths in Ancient Greece'. 'Basis' sounds good, but all the rest is bad. All ancient philosophers appeared thanks to these myths. It's not only philosophers that lived before the Common Era. I'm sure they had some other guys as well. I don't quite understand you. Didn't Ancient Greece also have some outstanding craftsmen? Why narrowing the topic? We only study a special circle of questions. Then enlarge this circle. Every science has its limits. What a petty approach, Professor. What do you propose to study then? You know what, Vitalyev, I want you to take care of workers. Workers? Yes, workers with golden hands. I'm sorry, but you're talking nonsense. Vitalyev. You have a Doctoral degree, right? Then kindly work it off. How dare you address me on a first-name basis? You lack intelligence, my dear fellow. Your tail was pinched, and you showed your real face. Comrade Lozhkin? - Mitrofan Tikhodonsky? - Yes. - And where is Gordei? - We're preparing a surprise for him. What an ace! To make such a career with no education at all! - What about some lunch? - Gladly, thank you. What a city! So huge, so wonderful! Man my friend, are you hungry? Honey, I'd eat something. You have a strong man's scruff. Well, you know better. I can see some wrinkles. Who angered you? I got upset because of Vitalyev, that dung chafer. It's not surprising. He's an antiquated old man. They think I'd only get gas for their cars. They are too much busy with ancient Greeks. What a light-minded lot. They should be held in leash. Oh, you are so fierce! Kiss me. No, kiss my little curl. We will live a vivid and full life , Gordei. We will invite singers, poets and musicians to our house. - Let them come. - We'll also invite Blyakhov. - Who is Blyakhov? - A famous chemist. He is doctoring up something in his experimental laboratory. Maybe, alcohol. Or, maybe, moonshine. Gordei! You opened the worlds to me. Hello? He's not here. I don't know. Will he receive us today or not? He's not here. We know. But will he come? I don't know. He's busy somewhere else. - We're busy, too. - His business is special. - Why are you so angry? - He's leaving. - Who is leaving? - Gordei Petrovich. - And where is he leaving to? - I don't know. But who told you this? Lozhkin. He said that Gordei Petrovich is leaving us. You look great. Only you grew a bit pale. - When did you arrive? - Hold your horses. My person comes last. First tell me how you schemed all this. Did you stop at a hotel? I'll stay at your place. Wait, you're planning to settle in this city? Oh, come on. Well... You know, I want to try myself at your institute. I was there today. Lozhkin asked me to come. Your colleagues wanted to make a surprise for you. - Parasites. - Not at all. One should cherish such attitude. Lozhkin met me at the station with flowers. It means he is very loyal to you. When I told him your story, he even rubbed his hands in delight. Rubbed his hands? He can't believe you're just a self-made man. But of course I'm on your side in this aspect. I even told him a folk wisdom. There are diamonds, I said, the result of work of many jewelers. Kabachkov is not such diamond. But there are lumps of gold or diamond untouched by Man's hand. So, our Kabachkov is this kind of man. With a diploma, it wouldn't be interesting. I told him how you and me were expelled from school on one and the same day. Do you remember? - Bastard! - At last, he believed me. It's you who's a bastard. Why did you come here? Who needs you here, you dirty crim? Now, get out of here! Hey, what the hell? Please meet my childhood friend. A combat fellow, too. I'm Tikhodonsky Mitrofan Semenovich. Iraida Yaroslavovna. I'm so pleased, so pleased to meet you. The city of Guldursun (this name also borne by the daughter of its ruler) was besieged by the Nomads. For many a day Guldursun watched from her tower a young handsome, the son of the invaders' tsar, and she fell in love with him. And she sent her maid with a letter to him where she wrote about her love and that the strength of her warriors was waning... The horde rushed into the city knowing no pity neither to the betrayer, nor to the besieged people. Orest. Is Nadezhda here? It's none of your business, dammit. Find her. I give you ten minutes. Tell me straight - what happened? I was outsmarted by the enviers. Thank God I had the work record card on me. - Experience, you know. - Orest... Oh, my God... Gordei... Nadya, pack your things, we're leaving. - Where to? - Rostov. You came too late, Gordei. I’m Mrs. Goodmanov now. What is he babbling? What an unthought-of impudence! Let him go away. Can't you see his presence unnerves me? What will happen to you now? The world is no good without good people. Have this. So, you mean you knew him before? Oh, yes. And I'm not surprised at what happened. - A con artist. - Well, but he grew up without parental love. On the contrary, it's his parents that had such an unloving son. No - he was raised in an orphanage. I'm amazed at your words. Who would have him there at all? My dear man, what can we do to return your kindness? Well, I don't know. - Don't stand on ceremony. - Tell us, dear friend. Well, you know... I wish I could become one of your crowd. I've been enchanted by science since my childhood. Well, very good, my dear sir. To love science is a sacred thing indeed...
