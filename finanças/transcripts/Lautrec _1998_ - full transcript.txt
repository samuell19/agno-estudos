Rain! God has blessed us! It shall be a male! Yes, Your Lordship! Diex lo volt! God wills it! Our ﬁne motto. Diex lo volt! - Be brave, Your Ladyship. - Be brave, Your Ladyship! - Dear lady, a male... - Sir! I promise. Come now, Your Lordship. - A son, or I'll break your nose. - You must leave. It is your duty to carry on the line. It will be a boy, I know it. My blood is boiling. So why are you panicking? It is your duty to carry on the line. Be brave, Your Ladyship! Do you hear? The time has come. Be brave, Your Ladyship! Thank you. You've nothing to drink. God cares not about our impatience. He isn't in a hurry. He's around for all eternity. Your Lordship! It's a boy. - An heir! - He's a bonny baby. Congratulations, Your Lordship. Sound the trumpets! What's going on? - Close it. - Shut the window at once! His Lordship thanks God. Protect yourself from the rain. I don't care about the rain! Never mind the rain! Thank you, Lord! I have an heir. Sound the trumpets! Bravo! God, the world is beautiful. Brave little boy. God loves you. He'll cure you. - Bones can be stuck together. - Yes. But for Henri's legs, you're powerless. I loathe the powerless. The doctors here are powerless. And why is that? Why, Your Ladyship? You were aware of the risks. You and your husband are related. - Our mothers were sisters. - Yes. God does not give life any old how. Hold your head high. Go home. Your son must accept his misfortune. What misfortune? Flutter your lashes at the rich lonely gents. Little Apple, have you seen? A muggins? Eye him up, Madame Have-em-all. - Alphonse, Count of Toulouse. - Little Shrimp. - Would you do me the... - Down, boy! A gentleman! Goodness! She'll throw him around. It's good to throw the nobility around. It's so chic here! Do you come here often? Pink champagne! 2 bottles for starters. Park your behind down, Alphonse. - What‘|| we chat about? - My sperm, of course. Of its uselessness in my marriage. I shall offer it to you after supper. Well, I never! It's hardly a gift! You got it in one, Alphonse. It's a ﬁne liqueur. Your Ladyship... God needs suffering to redeem the world. May God strike me down, not my son! God is not foolish. He won't listen to you. I'll warm you up some milk. May God strike me down! Grant me his suffering instead. Mr. Clubfoot... Hello, runt. For Her Ladyship. Henri's cousins will distract him. They arrive Saturday. Master Henri! All your cousins will be here Saturday! ls Jeanne d‘Armagnac coming too? Jeanne? Where's Jeanne? - Jeanne? - She's over there with Henri. Jeanne? It's Gabriel. They're challenging us! Jeanne. What? - I'm all ears, Mr. Beard. - Ouch! Father says one must learn about life before growing a beard. And what does he call life? - Hunting and women. - Hunting and women! And what's life for you? Painting. And... You. Jeanne, I give you my life. If love comes, I could marry you. They're challenging us to a game of ball. No, not now. After our walk. - Why? - Because I say so! My dear man, that woman is splendid. She is so kind-hearted. Thinking of her, I caress myself 3 times a day. Who do you think of when you do it? - Who? Gabriel? - Sorry? You're deaf. It's no wonder. Masturbation makes one deaf. We're going for a stroll! - No. We're playing ball. - No. A stroll ﬁrst. You portray your mother as a queen in exile. She's a queen, a goddess. A goddess upon whom I trample. I trample on her. With you, I'm a brute. Why put yourself down? The reality is worse. I'm an old sow. My dear, I get so bored here. On Tuesday, I shall give my mares' milk to my friends. Lady friends? Why do you accept Father's mistresses? Rather than stopping the sun shine? That isn't an answer. It is. Question your heart. Henri, painting is a job. So is life, my dear. Painting, Henri, must be studied in Paris. Oh! Gingerbread, cinnamon and honey. I've something to declare. We're holding a sack race. The farmers gave me some huge ﬂour sacks. Jeanne, I love you. - Answer, or I shall faint. - Please don't be so pathetic. It's in poor taste. No! A runt asking for someone's hand, that isn't pathetic. You can't control love. Henri, let's stay friends. I love my friends to death. Look, a walrus in love! Pervert! Your career is mapped out. The circus! You eat paint, dear man! Would you like to join the Atelier Cormon? That'd be pretentious of a dwarf. Very pretentious indeed, judging by your scribbles. Here are his daubs. The daubs of Mr. de Toulouse! Yuck! But to make us forget his pictorial diarrhea, our provincial has offered us... Foie gras, country ham and confectionery. Toulouse is one of us! Let us go, children of painting The day of glory has come! The old guard will be screwed Our strokes are masterly Our strokes are masterly Oh, it's beautiful. It must be delicious. Our very ﬁrst currants. They arrived from Albi today. To arms, Romans Shed your convictions March, march! So the old guard gets it up the arse Up the arse! Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, eminent French painter. Enjoy your scrub, Henri. Goodbye, ladies and gentlemen. Mother, "Here is your son." As it says in the Gospel. Henri, do not parody the Bible. Do not panic. Blasphemers are fools. It is no excuse for blasphemes. I shall ensure my son does not forget God. Cheers! Mr. Lautrec, idealize the model. A bottom is a bottom. Give her perfect, shapely curves. - People adore statues' bums. - Mine too, I hope. Your bum is hot! Quiet! Your strokes are edgy. All virgins are edgy. - You're a virgin? - Yes, sir. How sad! Oh dear! - Poor boy. - It's normal. Virginity is the lot of runts. Marie Charlet, the nation asks you to take care of this boy. Marie, unblock his cock. When, Mr. de Toulouse? This morning, this evening, tonight or tomorrow? I'll take the lot. Well done! Out you go! Too much curiosity can damage a model's concentration. Out you go! Shush. Come on! You weren't so pretentious the day you lost your virginity. Out you go! Are you afraid? Wait. Don't be in such a hurry. Was it my helmet that excited you so? No, your eyes. I love your smile and the hollows of your back. And now back to work. - They won't be back till morning. - I must paint. My feet are freezing, you can keep me warm. Mother will worry. Every day, before going to mass, she gives me a peck. I have to paint. Sorry. - You can't do without sleep. - I can. Easily. With a glass of white. Michelangelo, it's time to rest. You're insane. One has to be, Mother dear, to be Michelangelo. Mother, a girl as sweet as you took away my innocence. An earthquake, a cyclone on the ocean. Your son is going to become an unrepentant libertine. One should not tell one's mother such things. Shush! Repulsive peasant! When you enter this lair, you introduce yourself. My favorite little love: Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec. My goodness! Silence! Silence! Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, old nobility, my dears. 1,000 years ago, the Counts of Toulouse made the ﬁrst crusade. I'm bowled over! You can sit down. Alright, if His Lordship buys us a round. The little squirt of this noble line is buying a round. Hey, you nob, looking for votes to stand in the Montmartre elections? Who's her? - You provincial! - He's from a Toulouse. Aristide Bruant. Montmartre doesn't like nobs or snobs on this inspired hill, Mr. de Toulouse. We like red wine and raw meat. It gives us strength. We wipe our bums with good manners! We sing the poetry of the street, you syphilitic pricks. Here's Nini Peau d‘Chien. The Sologne is beautiful, but the hunting is terrible and the hunters terribly vulgar. Yet the marshes are magical when graced by the evening sun. Berthe, tell the kitchen. There are a few woodcocks in the boot of the car. Where's my darling bambino? Where's Mr. Leonardo da Vinci? My darling, where's Henri? Well, answer me. Henri has moved to a studio in Montmartre. Ah! They're beautiful. Henri is slaving away. He goes out till dawn then returns to his easel. He paints and he drinks. Maybe we should take up drinking absinthe. In Russia, Catherine the Great, straddled by her guard of honor, never let go of the bottle. What a lesson, my dear! Are you trying to shock me with your dirty jokes? Or make me cry? Do stay for lunch. ls it so hard to look me in the eye? I don't wish to see you cry or live with my eyes down. How does one say "tristesse" in Shakespeare's language? Degas agrees to look at your work. Degas is God. If he hates it, I shan't be able to bear his scorn. Who says he'll hate it? - I'm going to die. - Just look! Look! ls this an ambush? You invite me to a trap? What are you after? A good mark? Possibly. - Are you the doctor? - Yes. I'm a friend of Henri. Medicine is twaddle. Doctors cannot cure old age. You, Lautrec, are you in good health? One... two. - It's his favorite order. - Three, four... Etc. No good marks for you! You're one of us, Lautrec. One of us! Your brushes are ablaze, you rascal! Long live Degas! He's the master of the century! Don't move, giraffe. I have hiccups. I can't paint you like this. Bloody bitch, you asked for it! Arsehole! What will you do? Tear my eyes out? The monster wants to kill me! - Have you seen his hands? - Give that to me! - Don't touch that! - You and your bloody thing! You'll pay for this. Your daddy wants to smash your skull. He'll make mush of your brain. I'll have it out with him. - I'm going to bust his balls! - Go fight outside! This isn't a number for my cabaret. You're wrong, Aristide! It's an attraction! - You asked for it! - Throw that pimp out! Go on, get out! La Valadon. This dish sits for Renoir. A nice dish for you. Renoir knows all about cooking! Fuck! That's enough now! Rat face! Get out! Nice sketch, Madame Valadon. There's energy and force in your pen. Under her little hat On the Hill of Montmartre She had an air of innocence La Valadon was beautiful She smelt sweetly of fresh ﬂowers Rue Saint Vincent She never knew her father She had lost her mother And for many years She had lived with an old relative Where she raised herself All on her own Rue Saint Vincent ls there love in the air, Mr. Lautrec? Love at ﬁrst sight? I have good reasons to be wary of males. But you, you perisher, I've been waiting for you. An Embarkation for Cythera on a kitchen table, that's poetry. Only a man born with a silver spoon, would say such rubbish! When you're born in a hovel, you like creature comforts. We'll do it again tomorrow in a comfy bed. I have to take Maurice back to his grandma. He's asleep. Isn't the countryside beautiful? I prefer your smile. It lashes me like a whip. Henri, look at these colors! They're exploding. - I don't do landscapes. - You should. Nature bores me. You're wrong. Official art is depressing crap. But these colors strike you like a bullet in the heart. Long live the impressionists' light! Long live light! Long live colors! Henri... in love, as in art, there are frauds. I'm tired of men, of cheating, of emotions. We'll love without loving, our eyes open. We'll shut them to go underground. Long live the runt who is bored by nature! Before this masterpiece, all I can say is, let us admire it. Yes, ladies and gentlemen, let us admire it. I especially like the clouds... - It's so sad. - A mere anecdote. You're in a temple. Go fool around elsewhere. Of course, old dear, you're old. I would also like to praise Death of Ravana, Fernand Cormon‘s masterpiece. A horde of women and men in artistic drapery that reveals what can be seen. Historic nudity, useful for educating French youth. Thank you, my boy. Ladies and gentlemen, a ﬁght between giants has begun in painting. They align themselves with tradition or innovation. I shall let you guess which way my heart sways. Citizens, you are being lied to. You are being lied to. This. this, that and that, it is not painting. No. And that is not a real woman. It's for masturbating. Gentlemen, undo your ﬂies. These painters invite you to consume. Let us go, children of painting The day of glory has come! Anarchists! - Pricks! - lconoclasts! Please! Mediocrity! Learn how to paint before criticizing, children! Decrepit fool! - Arseholes! - Anarchists! Petty individuals! - Smart-arses! - Impressionists. So, young men, you're inviting worthies to masturbate before my art? Mr. Bernard, Mr. Lautrec, in your work, I see the deplorable inﬂuence of the impressionists. All the greats of painting spit on impressionism. Look at them. They are judging you. They judge idiots who know nothing of perspective, anatomy and common sense. I predict, gentlemen, Degas, Seurat and Monet will never be part of the heritage of mankind. And there's a reason for this. What link is there between the science of a Raphael and the daubs of Mr. Monet? None of that here! What about freedom? The freedom of impressionism? I piss on it! That's refreshing. Emile Bernard, you are expelled! I'd rather leave than be with imbeciles who scorns innovation. Silence! - Long live freedom. - You're expelled! Long live free art! Long live freedom! The freedom to stick your easels among the cowpats. Why throw him out of here? Lautrec, when I see the colors you use, I know what you think of my paintings. "| am not regenerating French art. "l‘m ﬁghting on paper, which has done nothing "and on which I do nothing. Send me 300 francs. "In February, I have a show in Belgium. "Kiss my mother and other branches of our family tree. "| may be a bad son, but I miss you." Here's your post. Oh! It's Mummy. When she comes to Paris, will you introduce me? Oh! It's beautiful. It's smashing. Henri? Suzanne? - This isn't your mother's home. - Kiss me. Excuse me. Kissing on the stairs! I want you! I want you! I want you! I want you! You've been kissing all evening. - My dear Léontine is shocked. - Léontine is shocked? - Léontine is shocked. - Yes. Suzanne, get undressed. In your studio, but not in my dining room. Léontine will leave. A doctor cannot work without a maid. - My knickers too? - Yes! La Va|adon‘s skin is softer than cotton underwear. May the lustful go to hell! Your lower back is a scandal, an outrage. - My arse is a scandal? - Léontine, have you seen? I can't serve with my eyes shut. Alas! You're a virgin, Léontine. Did you know Auguste Renoir feels like a young man again on seeing this behind? Léontine! Dessert is served. Careful, this is a collector's item! He's jealous of Renoir, because I'm sitting for him later. Competition is tough! Renoir is a solid painter. Yes, but his art is mawkish. There's spice in life. You want spice? Marry me. - They aren't married? - Léontine, don't weep. They're getting married. Léontine, if a beauty joins a family of degenerates, sorts out the pedigree, no? You agree? Let's marry then. Léontine, don't stick out your neck like an ostrich. What am I for you? A pretty behind? A model to be screwed in a studio? When will I see you? When will I see you? When you introduce me to your parents. La utrec, I'm not a doormat. I'm not a doormat either. Mr. Renoir, my kid is at my mother's. May I sleep in your attic? Has your lover thrown you out? With Lautrec, it's complicated. You know how to complicate what's simple. Damn, Renoir! Hello, Mr. Renoir. How's yer health? I really love, Lautrec. But I am jealous of his painting. Do you understand? Even with one foot in the grave, I understand everything. Don't exaggerate, Auguste. You're as fresh as a daisy. Oh shit! You waited all night for me. I'm absolutely exhausted. Does old Renoir paint by candlelight? He has a gas lamp. And he has enough gas to last all night. Painting preserves. He's suffering so he accuses! What a clown! You think I'm cheating as you know you deserve it! When you come back, you won't ﬁnd me! You're very quiet. A little miss in my life has become indispensable And? Sometimes she vanishes like a soap bubble. I remember when I was small how I would cry when the soap bubbles burst. Come with me this summer. Promise? Berthe told me you cry often. It's a mother's role. It's how they divert themselves. Oh, Mother... Mother... Shinpu Wa arimasen, the family! Hello, Alexandre. Long live Japan! Hello, Auntie. Hello, Henri. Ah! Mr. Henri! We've got him now! - Get down. It's stupid! - Jeanne! Jeanne! My bearded man. My husband. Her husband. Long live soldiers! Shinpu Wa arimasen, Mother, Mother... What is he saying? My darling. - ls Father awake? - No. Father is sleeping. And he whistles at a pretty girl. Your painting doesn't bother me. Lautrec, I always want to copy him. I can't bear that. Oh, an artist's jealousy, sad jealousy. What? Huh? No, nothing. Beddy-byes. Come on, beddy-byes! Beddy-byes... He's so handsome my sugar daddy when he sleeps like a baby. Why it's the great Renoir, who paints fat-bottomed girls. You nasty creature. - When will you back to Lautrec? - I'm in no hurry. He accused me of cheating. I'm punishing him. Girls are as complicated as painting. Auguste, be polite. ls it worth complicating an affair? - Yes. - Stop it! This old master captured real life. ls real life living with a model who's slept with all Paris's painters? You like women of loose morals? They're destitute. What is it? The truth hurts your ears? There is only one truth. Yours. ls that not so? Shut it, prick. What is God for you? A stupid being like me. Henri, tell your mother you adore her. Does she have a princess to offer me? Do you want kids who are monsters like your runt? You've never been bitter, don't become so. Life is a gift from God. Life... I don't understand it. But everything becomes simple when I do a drawing. Mother, I want to cry. If this young woman is waiting for you, you must go to her. Mother... You see, I was in a hurry to see you. I'm going to Limoges. Want some money for the trip? You will not need any. Listen, Gaston, go ﬁddle with your moustache. My fiance has a vineyard and his wine sells very well. Grandmother is sick. You've buried her 3 times. That's possible, poppet. So? So it doesn't matter. What I don't understand, I put in my paintings. The Gauls feared the sky would fall on their heads. Painting exists to tell us it is falling on our heads. So that's genius? Knee-high to a grasshopper, he has such a superior air. Come, my dear friend, get in. Go, coachman! What do you have against Limoges? The inhabitants make chamber pots. Nice story! - It's closer than Tahiti! - That's geography. Henri! What are we doing here? Painting needs a kick up the rear and raw beauty. This is raw beauty. You are beauty incarnate. I want you. I want you. Pose for me. You cannot refuse. We know what happens in the studios. You pose starkers and end up with a brat. Come on, girls the break's over! Pose for me. There are collars to starch and shirts to deliver. Come on, shift your backsides! - She has to pose for me. - Adieu. Come on, Héléne. I want the ﬂame she has in her eyes. Héléne. pose for me. Give me your answer tomorrow. Tonight I'll invite you out. - Who? Us? - I'll take you to Maxim's! Adieu, sir. Ladies, you're invited too. Only princes can invite the queens of Montmartre. Move it, funny chap. That's La Goulue, who dances at the Moulin Rouge. Shorty, come see me at the Moulin. It would be an honor. Beautiful obscene mouth, divine legs, a throaty voice. The cancan! The cancan! What are all these ﬂowers? Baskets for your princesses. He's mad. They aren't princesses, they're skivvies. Ah! Lautrec. Come! What are you up to? The 3 of us are going to pee. Good idea, isn't it? - ls that Suzanne? - It can't be. She's in Limoges. Hide your moustache! Silence! And now, it's time to bust your kneecaps. The cancan! Psst! The dwarf is looking for you. Me too. Why do you think I'm on all fours? - Suzanne is over there. - What? - Aren't you in Limoges? - I just got back. On all fours? Has no one ever told you the bigger a boy is, the dumber he is. Follow me. The ﬁnest dance in Montmartre: the quadrille! La M6me Fromage! Nini-Pattes-en-Pair, Grille d‘Egout. Dancers are asked to remember their knickers La Goulue! And the local phenomenon: Valentin le Désossé! Valadon, your perisher is looking for you. - This way? - That way. I'll go this way. - Gabriel, is Suzanne here? - If she's here, we'll ﬁnd her. - Has anyone seen Suzanne? - Which Suzanne? Suzanne? Suzanne? - Now that's a jig! - Yes, but still no La Valadon. - I saw her over there on all fours. - Valadon? Get your arse over here! There are other bottoms than La Va|adon‘s! - Ain't that so, girls? - Yes! Was Suzanne there or not? It was a girl who looked like her. You're lying. Put down your brushes. I want you, little runt. Valadon, our love life is quite disappointing. It is time to end it. End. E, n, d. I've missed you. It's far, Limoges. Eh... rascal. Did you take advantage? Did you have wild time? You see, Henri, your little woman isn't jealous. Grandmother is well? Which one? Ah, Nanny? Who has a nice moustache? She gave me this dress. I killed her. Now, between you and me, no more grandmothers. I love you. Says the billy goat. Right, well... I won't play gooseberry. Why be afraid of posing for me? I didn't want to make you cry. I'm not crying. Let's go. Please agree. Agree. The little nob is funny. We'll have fun, eat trufﬂes and ices with a dash of Madeira. We're going to eat our ﬁll! Expect nothing from me. You're wasting your time. A girl like me isn't interesting. Go eat your trufﬂes. And Sarah Bernhardt? If you weren't my sister, I'd wallop you! Théo! Théo! She afraid of mirrors and light. A constipated girl! Vincent, you're crying? What's wrong? Who painted that? Who painted this picture? Impossible. Impossible to get together to look at reproductions. And above all... to encourage one another. What ﬁne mud! What beautiful boots. Brother, are you sincere? You speak from the heart? Your pictures speaks of poor people and pain. Vincent, thank you. - He's taking you. - I'm an honest woman. - I'm gonna stab you! - No knives. Leave him be. He's drunk on red wine. Love is complicated, isn't it, Henri? Get the cows off the dance ﬂoor. We want to dance! Music! Music! No! None of that! - He's drunk! - The dog must die. No! Go on, stab him! Bastard! Hey, that's evidence! With soft pink, blood red, say on canvas that you can lose your shirt at a cafe, go mad, commit crimes, in an atmosphere of Japanese gaiety and rakish bonhomie. Bloody coppers! The dog must die! - Get out! - Don't send me to Guyana! He's a dog! A problem in a guinguette and... the guillotine chops off a head. - It's beautiful. - Indeed. Henri. We could paint the same picture. It's risky. But why not? Why not. Want to try? Look. These old Japanese masters are showing us the way. Reﬁned colors, yet as bright as signs. Yes. With colors, express joy, tranquility, pain. Tranquility. Pain. Pain and tranquility? That's ﬁre and water together. Like the two of us. Like us. Fire and water is... beauty. Vincent said so. Joy, tranquility, pain! - No shouting here. - Get out. Don't touch me! Who served these people? This is an exclusive establishment. Ladies and gents, if painting and poetry are like a good meal for you, You are pigs. Bon appétit! This is an exclusive establishment. It's appalling. - Appalling. - Vincent. Only the destitute can understand. Poetry is made for them. What is this life? Let me hold you. And our lives? Let me hold you. You too. One must be humble. Art is made with our hands, but it is not the product of our hands alone. It springs from a deeper source. There is a source. I'm far from it. Henri, my hands are heavy. My mind is too weak. Don't tremble. Things change. Everything will change. The century will end with a massive revolution. We won't be here after the storm to know better times, when all society will be bathed in pure air and freshness. Sister, look. It's the bloke who wanted to paint the ﬂame in your eye. Hello, Mr. Lautrec. Eh... Héléne! - And the colors, bright. - Yes. Beautiful work. Great work. It's beautiful. Bravo, runt! In 10 years' time, the critics will see you're a genius. In 10 years' time, will you greet me in the street? I'll end up in the gutter. And you will walk by, proudly. with little wings on your back, like the Genius of Bastille. Shall we start up the machines? Goom Henri, it's you who'll end up in the gutter. One day I'll go tickle your toes at the morgue. Pascal said, "The last act is bloody." Oh, the perisher! You'll be buried at the Pantheon! What a clown! Pause. Why wouldn't I break her jaw? You're not allowed to drink. I can do what I like. I'm La Goulue. - See that? - It's beautiful. Every Parisian is talking about it. And you know what they say? "La Goulue is a fat cow." I'll make you eat your shit! Hitting an invalid is mean. You're ugly! Shut it, or I'll bust your nose. You too! You again? With this poster, the world is at La Gou|ue‘s feet! Did she hurt you? I love her. The Prince of Wales has come to see you dance because of it. Bravo! Mr. Lautrec. Mr. Zidler, did you see that? Do that again, and you're ﬁred! This poster is the new art. It's advertising. The museum is in the street, and it brings in money. Advertising is great. Off you go, my lovelies. Kick those legs! Your New Art is shit. Shake your bum, La Goulue! Don't cry, sir. It's so sad. Little genius, the official salons reject you, but the poster's made you the most famous of painters. It isn't crap, little runt. Why are you sad? Why this sadness? Van Gogh has killed himself. I want to kill! I want to kill... Let go of me. You're mad, Henri. Don't ﬁght! Henri, we're in Belgium. - There are prats everywhere. - Calm down. There are prats everywhere. ls he talking about me? Unbelievable! This ass is threatening me. I can barely see him. He's tiny. Mr. de Groux. Mr. De Groux, let's save Franco-Belgian friendship. Does your runt know I often practice with my pistol? The duel will be unfair. Mr. de Groux! Good God, hell's about to break loose. The French are louse. Mr. de Groux. You afﬁrm calmly Mr. Van Gogh is deranged and his painting is... the product of a sick mind. I defend real painting against madmen‘s delirious art. You know nothing about it, you heap of shit. Indeed, dear man. - Arsehole. - Mr. de Toulouse! - Ignorant arsehole. - You've gone too far! Big fat turd. - Bloody fat Belgian. - Henri! Tomorrow, I shall put a bullet in your brain. And every year, I will come and piss on your grave. Mr. de Toulouse! - You're no gentleman. - Leave me alone! If you'd died, what would've become of me? You'd have become yourself. Another yard of wine to drink, and all will be perfect. Painting is an ogre. Your brother knew it. Vincent, we're consoling ourselves by eating omelets. Poor Vincent. The dogs got you. Brilliant runt. Suzanne... Don't cling to me. It's hot. Where's he going with his little prick and bowler? To see the whores. ls he lonely? No more than anyone else. Come, if you like big girls. You'll get lost in my breasts. - Come on, you! - We'll make it worth your while. No thank you, ladies. I'm not a low-class whore. Daddy was a civil servant. I put my heart into it. And I do unusual things. You look dazed. - An anvil fell on my head. - A what? An anvil. It could have been worse. He's funny, the runt. Has your little lady left you? Rosa the Red will comfort you. I won't do it again! He's going to kill her. The bastard's killing her. - What is this, you bloody dyke! - Don't hit her! In my little belly, your baby's moving, bastard! That's Mireille. Her pimp's beating her. When you do that... That dog is meaner than a rich man's son. And they're less than nothing. I love him, but he mustn't hit me. I'm delicate. My joints are fragile. Your pimp beats you? Don't you make enough? I'm the biggest earner. Why then? - Théodule caught us together. - What a boor! Nothing is nicer than 2 girls masturbating. At last! A man who knows that, between us women, sex is always an affair of the heart. Cover him with kisses, darlings. Long live the outcast! Long live the Lesbo! Champagne! It's OK for Théodule to beat her, but he's sold her. My sensitive Mimi will live in a brothel. - Slavery. - Tenderness! Champagne! Champagne! He has strayed from God. I couldn't stop him. I'm ashamed. I don't know how to handle him. A useless old woman. It is not my wrinkles that torment me, but my inner poverty. A dry, old, useless soul. It's awful. Our greatest saints and mystics all said the same thing: "My soul is dry." Did you know that? Henri's painting is becoming worrying. There's a monster in his heart. I don't want to see him lost. His soul is so big. I'm afraid. How's your love life? Valadon? She's gone. Where's the Prince of Albi? - Miss Valadon. - Where's my fiancé? Henri? Henri! You won't escape a wedding at Madeleine Church, with organs and a choir! You don't need a man to tickle your fancy. Oh, darling... Henri! She'll have her wedding, but she tires me. It's my bachelor party tonight. Where's the Prince of Albi? Come on. Tell me, you dykes. She's voracious. La utrec! Marry me, or I'll kill myself! - I bought some arsenic! - Blackmail? That's bad. - All that for a willy. - But his is priceless. I don't like dykes. That's rather vulgar, darling. - You're marrying for money. - No. I'm not a whore. It's shameful, sluts selling their pussies. - We have a well of love. - Don't insult them. None of us deserves this. All the scum on earth deserves your love. And who deserves your love? I've had it with universal love. Suzanne, I love you. We'll get married. Goodbye, Countess. Goodbye, Countess! Come on, Suzanne. Get up. We're going buy a bridal gown. And we're going to see the priest. In Montmartre, not so long ago, there were cows under the windmills' sails. Manure ran down the lanes. Henri... I'm going to throw myself in a manure pit. Suzanne, I love you. We're getting married. Are you sure you love me? Are you really sure? No. I love your painting. Henri. The drunkard is me. The old bag full of port, that's me! Oh, a turd! He's fast asleep. The performance is over, Mr. Henri. Everything is over, dear lady. Valadon has left me. It's the end of the world. She's moving. - I shall die. - You won't. We'll comfort you, my boy. Girls! Girls! It's Mr. Henri. Before entering Hell, he says Heaven lies behind the last door! Good grief! When you visit the whores, remember Dante and the giraffe. The customer is king here. Joy and pleasure! Our girls are very healthy. And nothing is better, gents, than having it away without fear. Joy and pleasure! This is sport! We have a mortuary chamber, strict nannies and a nursery. Mr. Henri! Mr. Henri! I'll fetch Mireille! I'll introduce you to my girl. It's sweet of you to visit. Gents, get your cash out. It's time to splash out! We've got redheads, blondes, girls from up north who smell of the sea! Are all Paris brothels like this? Holy Mary! Come on, gents, a bit of cash! Do you want me to pose or for us to screw? Do both at once. Little man, get your brush out. Miss Valadon. Rosa the Red. No need to introduce Gaston. You know Grandma. Please, my dear. I'm not coming back. I'm moving out. Yes, madam. I need Gaston to carry my boxes. Gaston, are you strong enough to carry Valadon? Jealous! He wanted me to marry him. To become his slave. To cook for him, to clean his brushes. Excuse me. That's alright, madam. Pick up the boxes. She says such nonsense. Hurry up, my dear. But when she paints, she's bonkers. She paints souls. Souls with bumps and bruises. Don't fret, Gaston. Lautrec is neither Plato nor Bergson. His philosophy reeks of absinthe. Bloody perisher! I need something you're incapable of giving me. What do you need? What do you need? How should I know? Poor little cat. How about this? Swan Lake. Smart decor for a brothel. Ah, handsome trooper. My son is a soldier like you. Pleasure of love and great Parisian chic. Gentlemen, take your pick. All our girls speak English. I don't know every girl in Paris, but I can vouch for her. Very clean. On the ﬁrst ﬂoor, it's wet. Of course! I'd forgotten. Gentlemen, come along. Come on, gentlemen. Hurry now. You're so sweet. Come in. There you go! - Henri? - Father. Be patient. They're comforting each other. I'm sorry. Forgive me. No, sir. We're available. Mr. Henri mixes up work and pleasure. Come in, lovers. A sensitive family matter. They're 2 shy friends who wanted an orgy. Come in my skirts! This way, you Brits! The article on your exhibition broke your mother's heart. These dogs attack your inﬁrmity. Father, don't argue with critics. Criticism is above us. It lives on our heads, like lice. Listen. "Lautreds gifts are depraved gifts "of an invalid who sees ugliness in all." It's outrageous. What's going on? Our name is dragged through the mud. Critics are bastards! Whores never make fun of nobs. We know how to live. We receive kings, bishops and army top brass. And Brits! Alright, heroes, let's play bagpipes! It's the entente cordiale! His pecker isn't up. Don't wave around the article like Moses with the Stone Tablets. It gives the impression you chose to be deformed. Who knows? God is cunning. Honestly, I preferred it when you sketched horses. Our two Scots stank of garlic. Forget about it. Don't talk about sad things. I'm exhausted. - I look terrible. - Don't talk about sad things. It's forbidden. Why make a painting of this scene? These women are so destroyed, so great. Beauty. Mr. Henri, want to eat some spuds with us? I preferred it when you drew horses. Father! Poor Father. For those who know how to look, our nobility takes their breath away. You're beautiful, my loves. No, no! She has the pox. 187. Rosa the Red, normal. Fetch the 2nd batch. Forward! Goom - Faster! - Hurry up, girls! Come on, move it! That's enough! Get a bloody move on, you! No, no! You're with the contaminated girls A girl gave you a bad gift. And you'll have it for life. Indolent buboes. There's no doubt about it. Going to cut me up? Embrocation. I'll enrich your blood with mercury, in the hope it'll have an effect. Madame! Madame! Madame! Madame, the police! Madame, the police! - Madame, the police! - The police? Why the police? Henri isn't a murderer. Oh my God, the poor child. Mother, like the postal service, the police delivers parcels. You can't stop progress. A bit more. You're killing yourself. To keep me awake. To see reality in my paintings. A small glass. Mother, it's hard to see reality. Where is reality? In the brothels? My friends tell me you spend weeks on end there. - Why? - Because I'm happy there. Mother, in a brothel, my painting makes great bounds. Please. I must paint. Please. Henri. I got out of St Lazare. We can't screw any more. I've got the pox. Why are you smiling? If we carry on, I'll ruin your life. Rosa, you've given me the very best of gifts. Not you. Damn, I've contaminated you. Damn. The very best of gifts... your hair. The wonderful red of the Italian Renaissance masters. I love it. Angels come down to Earth from Albi, on their atrophied legs. I'm afraid. Every night, I wake up in a sweat ten times. Farewell, my dears It doesn't mean Henri is dead. The little fellow lifted my spirits. You men break my heart. I'm tired of your whining. Do you know what you men are? Absolute shits. Henri's friends have searched every dive, hospital and morgue. Suffering, destroyed, sick... Henri wants to die far from me. ls the weight of world evenly distributed? ls God fair? I don't know, Your Ladyship. I don't know. But I do know the question gives mystics ulcers. Some prostitutes have seen Henri. Music! A creature in your pants? These boys need to dream. Look at this, young men. That's a belly. She was smuggled in. Her anatomy is a dream. Inside, you can delve into the well of pleasure of La Goulue, who made the Prince of Wales lose his mind! Throw us your coins, young men! There he is. Henri. your mother cannot sleep. She refused to eat. - Her Ladyship is weeping. - It's a mother's role. She's dying. You must go south with her. What does she want? For me to die in Albi? To see her little Henri agonizing in her drawing room? Come on, Henri. They don't have hands, but hooks! Don't harpoon me. I'm a whale! I need the wide open sea. Go! He's gone mad. You cannot help him. Protect yourself. Your despair is madness! Henri, one day, we'll have to talk about madness. Madness, Henri. Why is she talking about madness? Leave Paris. Leave him be, Ladyship. The little whale needs plonk. Leave him alone, madam. Why chase away your mother? When dear Mother is away, the ﬂies do play. Why did you tell her she couldn't help you? Even the dead... he doesn't scare, little Henri! I'm musing about a product of Earth: oil. Cheers, old trunk! By this tree, Van Gogh embraced me. - What's he doing? - What did he say? The Earth that bore Van Gogh cannot be... damned. Miss Amélie. Miss Héléne. In Montmartre, beauty blossoms. My regards, Miss Héléne. I cannot put your solemnity... your nobility on canvas. Why are you so sad? I didn't want to pose. I don't want to talk about myself. I can't paint anymore. Maybe I never knew how. There's money on the table. Help yourself. His mummy who had no hubby Called him her little Henri But they called him the Snatcher in Bastille Bloody perisher, you can't mess up a painting. One day. the boy I loved asked me to kill myself with him. He did it. I didn't follow him. Ever since I've felt so gloomy. That's the story. I'm ashamed. I didn't see Death is devouring you. Let's start again. Mr. Lautrec... how do people manage to live? To further scientiﬁc education, Professor Péan invites individuals to attend his dissection classes. But we must remind you cries and displays of emotion disturb the surgeon's work. Why, it's... Héléne said, "| love a dead man. I must go to him." I replied, "It's stupid to kill oneself." This morning, she hung herself. Admirable and so foolish. Look at her poor neck. Cries and displays of emotion... What do you ﬁnd so fascinating? Do you want to depict this violence? The pathetic has no place. The tranquil cruelty of daily life is enough. The cruelty of daily life? He was born by the canal Down near the arsenal His mummy who had no hubby Called him her little Henri But they called him the Snatcher At Bastille To commit Henri is to help him. You must sign. We should send him to England. Drinking isn't frowned on. - All the lords drink. - You won't sign it? No! To hell with the Republic's laws. Henri regularly sets ﬁre to his studio. Read this. A Lautrec is free to end his life as he sees ﬁt. What is the friend of virtue thinking about? The statues on Easter Island. They seem to know that giving birth is painful. You're signing alone. Your Ladyship, solitude is your lot. I'll get you back on your feet. I don't need help! I draw on my inner strength. Like the great Van Gogh who gave his ear to a whore! What is it that we're doing? What are we doing? The time of the Toulouses is over like that of the crusades. - Alphonse! - It's over. It's over. Uncle, you've been drinking. - Alphonse is drunk. - No. I've seen with my own eyes a great family's decline. The aristocracy has sunk without a trace... into piss. You're drink. Finished! Yes, my bitches, here's your sugar. Here, here. And the best for a saint: Madame de Toulouse. It's a ruby. - It's gorgeous. - Truly gorgeous. Even in a republic, only countesses can wear rubies. - ls the republic sad? - As sad as rain in a cemetery. Republican equality! I'll give you bloody equality. The ring is for you. I'll keep the box. An empty box. That sums up my life. Wait! Don't go. We girls are going to lick you all night long. Alright? Amélie is dead. The last descendant in a house of lunatics. For the Wagnerian ﬁnale, the Toulouses have their emblem. An empty box. Your Lordship. Your stick. - Ouch! - Mind your head. Lautrec wants pencils, to prove he is of sound mind. - ls he of sound mind? - Don't panic. We will treat him. Manager, your brothel is too sanitized, too hygienic. The clients prefer ﬂashy decors. Colors! And odd sense of humor. He dances in the air. It's dangerous. Suzanne! He's delirious. You don't have a damn clue! - You're married? - Yes. To a wealthy stockbroker. La Valadon has become respectable. Old biddies call her "Madame", and she has scores of lovers. Love is health. The honey of life. We're going to cure you. Icy water. Age-old therapeutic tradition. Henri, I have thousands of clowns in my life. But at night I miss you. And by day. With Suzanne, it was hell. At the end of it, there was blue sky. Blue sky. Darling. your pencils will free you. Pencils are not wood and lead. But thoughts of the ﬁngers. I don't recognize my Henri. He seems dazed, as if struck by lightning. As if the void of his brain had been revealed. As if, in his anguish, he had found solace. What has he found? The secret of painting or a snobbish way of sketching? I don't know. You'll release him? Yes. His sketches are beautiful. Terriﬁed strokes above the void. New Art is an art inspired by madness. Its inspiration is not God or princes anymore, but dementia. - Yes. If artists are prophets, next century will be terrifying. - What of the great judges decided? - Henri, you're free. I'm on parole? But he's going to watch me. Henri, you're fragile. - I'm your friend, your nanny. - My nanny, my lady's companion. My rather hairy Pompadour. What's the matter, Henri? Excuse me. Tomorrow, you're free. The birds are singing. The blue sky, the birds sing tweet, tweet. Tweet, tweet. Coachman, 24 Rue des Moulins. Rue des Moulins? But that's a brothel. A very well-frequented brothel. You're searching for the abyss. Henri, you know you're fragile. You're searching for the abyss? This boy needs perking up! Good God, where is he? Henri. Henri! - You shoved me. - You lost something? Henri! What have you lost? Henri! Henri! He's stupid, stupid, stupid. Henri! Henri! Gentlemen! Gentlemen! Get a move on, you lot! Have you seen a sad little man with a beard? Hurry LIP! Come on! Your billhook is sinister, my dear man. Will you cut off our balls with it at the Last Judgement? I know you, master. I know your posters, you're famous. I am not, but I have faith. In this old thoracic cage, an adolescenfs heart beats for Shakespeare and for Moliere. Ah, our Moliére! I played Moliére. Yes. Clumsily, but with diligence. Mr. Lautrec, applaud the fool who played Moliére and who now cuts grass for his rabbits. Is everything alright, master? No. I lack seriousness. A serious painter should... grab himself by the hair and rise above the ﬂoor. Above the... And apart from that? We have fun, get bored, wait for the judgment. The judgment? The last judgment? That of Albi Cathedral has always taken my breath away. The judgment. Times have changed, chum. God no longer judges. Painters must judge God in their art. Master, judging God is... Farting higher than your ass, isn't it? It isn't easy. Van Gogh was the ﬁrst to succeed. Oh, Pompadour has found baby! Huh? She's happy! Master! Master! Look! Suzanne! Suzanne! To our bitter love life! The toad only drinks apple juice now. Nanny is looking out for me. Henri! I love you, you love me. My heart bleeds. When old lovers meet again, they keep their mouths shut. Don't ruin things with words when the heart bleeds. It's beautiful. It's beautiful. I'm glad I left you. Or you'd have corrected my work, you'd have made me do Lautrecs. I never corrected your work. No, it was more insidious. You screwed your eyes when my style resembled yours. I loved your eyes. To see you screw them up, I'd have aped you. What a joke! Do you hear? The genius is so dumb. How's your stockbroker? Forget him! He was a perisher. Don't let go of your pencils. A pencil is a good ramp. May God protect you from yourself. Henri! Where is the romance of youth? Does the past end up in the gutter? No. - In your heart, warm. - Ah? Yes... The boy is dog-tired. He needs the sea to perk himself up. Henri, we have to go! The wind is freezing. Go to hell, Viot! Dear friend, please. The sea, sir. The sea, dear to Homer. On hearing the waves, the blind man cried, "Yo! Yo!" to greet them. All dreamers love the wide open sea. Before the open sea, Homer must have declaimed too. A Poem. please! "When I hear my heart beating, it is Mother calling me." It is Mother calling me! Mother! Mother! ls Her Ladyship here? Please excuse me. What's going on? - What's going on? - We don't know, we're waiting. Your Ladyship, you have to get out. Henri. Henri! We're here. Before I get out, may I sleep? I'm exhausted. Yes. Maybe we should all pray. As a boy, I knew that in spring, the sap rises into the trunks. And one afternoon, to check, I ran to the meadows. In those days, a tree was my friend. I trotted along happily on my little legs. For the last time. The following day, I was in plaster. Trees are beautiful. Goon You've never painted landscapes. Bodies and faces are impossible to capture. So landscapes... - I shall tell you a secret. - I love secrets. The most delicious scent is that of a woman's belly button. On smelling it, I sensed the divine. Who else can hide there except God? Your Ladyship, see what's come from Paris! Henri! Your father in a motor car. The hens had better hide. That thing will crush them. These machines are so noisy. Your Lordship, your carriage is beautiful. Henri! You're basking in the sun like a Tuareg. My Henri Flaubert, the great, loved the Tuaregs. Especially their beauties, with hips like amphorae. Would you like to go to the Sahara or the Orient? Have you come for the kill? - Sorry? - Just nonsense. Have you come for the kill? Exactly! I'm going to kill a boar, and its good dark meat will put you back on your 3 or 4 feet, if we count your sticks. Careful. Careful. Van Gogh, Raphael, Watteau, exitus at 37 all three. Be quiet. It doesn't leave me much time, if I can count. You're talking nonsense. Nonsense... Nonsense... You're a silly fool. All I can do is kill ﬂies. Thank heavens, in a republic, ridicule does not kill. I don't want the beasts to bite you. Why not, if God wills it. Diex le volt. That's the family motto. Ah, poor father... Beauty is a mystery. Rubbish. A painter dreams a painting, God trips him up. Stop teasing Monsignor. You're an agitator. A digression, Mother. In the history of painting, an insigniﬁcant digression. Admiral! Everything has a meaning. All is logical. Thank you, Admiral. Thank you. What are you dreaming about? The ocean waves. The sea, said Homer. Mother. You. You alone, Mother. God will help you. He is good and just. Really? That's perfect then. You have to be a prick like me to demand justice from God. Coachman, is your name Henri? Henri? Like the kings of France. Like my little king. - Bye Henri! - Bye Henri! Let's whip up a storm! Bye Henri! Bye Henri! Subtitles: Eclair Group
