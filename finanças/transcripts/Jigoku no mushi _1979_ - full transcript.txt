THE ARTS FESTIVAL COLLABORATION HELL WORMS I'm asking you, please. Please. I'm sorry, it was an impulse. Don't let him escape! Kill him! FAMILY HEAD YAZAEMON, CUTDOWN FROM ABOVE THE RIGHT SHOULDER. YAZAEMON'S WIFE, STABBED TWICE. EIGHT PEOPLE HAVE DIED IN TOTAL. SIX BOXES WORTH 1000 RYOS WERE STOLEN They killed an entire family. I heard the boss was beheaded. That sounds horrible. And they stole six boxes worth 1000 ryos. The money's cursed. They say there were six people. Or maybe ten. The thieves fled from Tsuchiyu to Mount Azuma. Gather the villagers. We will hunt them down. Not a single ant shall escape. Arrest all travellers on the roads. Tobe, the destral user. Koga style Ninja. Shichi, twin sword user and a former Shogunate retainer. Denji Osaraba, fast feet, and good at escaping. Gonkuro Gokumon, with 12 criminal charges. Sanji Yamaneko, never lets his prey escape. Masa, a sumo wrestler. A1000 ryo box is very heavy. Well, it has a thousand one ryo gold coins. Of course, it's heavy. I have never seen gold coins before. When we arrive in another province, I'll treat you until you burp. Can we get to the road from here? There are roads everywhere. Don't be arrogant. I'm not one of your comrades. Currently, you're one of us. Don't forget that I told you about this job. And you, it all went well for you because the Kurogumo family was with us. Loosen up now. Get along. Boss, Danjuro Kurogumo. Otoyo, Kurogumo's lover. How are you? Nice, isn't it? The crow's cawing is a bad omen. I'm good at imitating any kind of sound. Don't get too close to Otoyo, or else I'll kill you! Don't worry, boss. I prefer sake and money. I'm tired of women. The road's over here! I'm lost. How do I get to the Tsuchiyu Mountain Pass? Near the pass there's a cabin, ask there. Forget it. You didn't have to kill them. It was to protect the others. How terrible... You were aware of the consequences. Did you lie when you said you'd follow me to hell? Among the countless women, you're the only one for me. Mine. Do you regret it? I regret being born in this world. Then the same applies to the rest. My mother worked as a hostess at a roadside inn, but there were many men, so I have no idea who my father is. By the twist of fate, I ended up being born. Surely she liked a man and must have thought that I should be his daughter. Would you like to bear my child? If I'm able to. I'll make love you so that you can have my child after we've crossed over to another province. Sure, why not keep dreaming? It's not just a dream. Look how much money we have. Money that you got by robbing and killing. Either way, that money came from abusing and deceiving people. He was the real thief and murderer. Did you allow him to do that? There are rules among comrades. Though I'd forgive you for breaking them, Hokketaro won't. Gonkuro, I will turn a blind eye because you brought the job to us. I apologize for the mistake of my minion. Those who break the rules among allies are the worst scum! I don't know anything! Help me! I don't know anything! Help me! Lock him up in the cell! Won't they even let me see my parents while they die? Complain to the bandits! When will we be able to visit them? I don't know. I'm hungry... I can't walk... You're not the only one. Hold on. It gets heavier every time. This will make you feel better when we cross the border. We'll be killed acrossed the mountain. I want money but I also cherish my life. I forgot that you're the boss's right-hand man. I finally realized that you're not on our side. I see. You're also good-for-nothing. My parents used to say the same, that I was good-for-nothing. That's why I ran away from home, but it didn't work out. The boss saved me when I was trying to take my own life. However, things are going well for me now. When you receive your share, go back home, and become someone respectable. Open up a shop and call your parents. They'll be happy. And what will you do? I'll leave that to the boss. You're in love. Our paths are intertwined... Help! Help! Help him... Let go of the coin box. Masa-san, don't let go of the box! Do you plan on abandoning your comrade? I won't die with that pig. Throw away the box! Help! He killed himself and took the box with him. What a waste. It's a tremendous loss. Now each of us will get less. That boy from the Kurogumo family was your minion. You'll make up for this loss. We'll get 2000 ryo each. Someone just died and you don't even feel remorse. You're inhuman! He's hungry, too. Just when you were about to forget it... And that time you told me to steal food. Who hit me when the box got lost? A box of 1000 ryos will not satisfy my appetite. How happy Masa must be, he will no longer starve. I want to annoy the person who hit me. Was it a dream? So everyone's here. No one is missing. I gather the 2000 ryos, right? We'll talk about that after crossing the mountain. I say farewell to you here. How about you wait until dawn? I don't have to stay by your side. Watch out for the wolves. It's dangerous to walk down the mountains at night. It won't fill your stomach, but it will keep you alive. Don't throw away the umeboshi seeds. Give us some too. Supposedly we are no longer comrades. If you leave, don't give them anything. If you stay, share. You'll pay dearly if you betray us. It's the cabin! Feed us. Hey, won't you offer us some food? So you resist. You'll die if you do anything! Will you kill me? Kill the baby and me. I have reasons to stop go on living. Just look at me... my wife and mother passed away. One of them slashed her throat. I was about to kill him and take my own life. I can't kill a baby... I can't. Please, kill both of us. Tell me why you want to die. I asked Mr. Yazaemon from the Hatsukari village for 2 ryos! With interest, it turned into ten ryos. That's why, two weeks ago, they took away our belongings. We survived by drinking water. Did you say Yazaemon from the Hatsukari village? Without knowing it, we ended up avenging the oppressed. This guy's seen our faces. As you wish, you'll die! Let's take him with us. He can carry the box. Great idea. At least one more will make things easier for us. I don't mind the weight. If you carry that box and follow us, I'll grant your wish. What will we do with the baby? If we leave him, he'll die even if we don't lay a hand on him. I'll carry him. The villagers said we should stay in the cabin tonight, you see it? Give me some of those rice balls. I have plenty of money. Murderer! Murderer! Pilgrims on route. Tsukitate Village. Mohei. He plans to kill us. Let's set aside the 2000 ryos. Lets take the 1000 ryo box and run away. Tobe! I've been in love with you for a long time. Let's run away together. We'll live without problems with 1000 ryos. We have to do it now. He's a worm from hell. He can't make you happy. I'm sorry, little bird. Live a full life. Boss, kill me now, please. No need to rush. Just a little more. How peaceful it must feel to die in a place like this. I could never let go of this treasure to die. Is that your dream? I wanted money because I was born in a poor household. Anything can be done with money. Do you want to escape too? I'll never let you do that! I've been ready to go to hell with you since we met. You've killed a lot of people. Do you want me to kill you? Are you planning to do it? Don't make me feel alone. Boss, I didn't betray you. Sir, if we find them, please help us. They won't be beheaded or crucified. Well, no, because we returned the box to them. You betray your allies and want to escape punishment, you human scum. How dirty! You're the dirty ones. Both listen carefully. It will be impossible to escape while we carry these boxes. Do you hear those sounds, right? So abandon the boxes and flee. And what will you do? I'm determined to go to hell. I just realized that I'm a worm. Not now... but back then. Those pilgrims were my parents. TSUKITATE VILLAGE MOHEI It is obvious that... whoever killed your parents will go to hell. I also killed my mother. Please, end my life. This wicked world killed your mother. It wasn't your fault. This wicked world defeated you. That's why you have to survive. You have to win! Do you understand?! You have to live with all your strength for the sake of the baby. It's okay. I'll live and work for my baby. It surprises me that you listen to a thug like me. You have to live no matter what happens. Don't you dare die. Will you go with me to the end of the world? Take me with you... We're in this together, but let's get along. Death pays us a visit. Do it quickly, while this dream continues. I take refuge in Buddha. Damn Reaper, come here! The real Kurogumo will die in a dignified manner, like a thief! Mortals gets agitated, mortals die. Unknowingly, the morning came that made... the rumors a thing of the past. Mohei, the characters on the hat are different. In fact, they took the wrong hat at some transit station. So, this is the hat of the pilgrim who was murdered in the mountains. What a bad omen. The son we will visit, could he be that accomplice? He is not that kind of person. I hope you're right. THE END
