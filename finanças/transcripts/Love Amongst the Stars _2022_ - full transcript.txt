- Because our telescopes are only capable of viewing the brightest stars, there is still much debate over the precise number of stars in our galaxy. Yes? - What about comets? Now, comets are a very interesting case because, yes, they typically burn brighter than stars, so one would assume they're much easier to see and quantify. But even still, there are comets whose existence is disputed today. I'll give y'all an example. Aiden 54P, or as you all probably know it, the Lover's Comet, is a comet from mythology. Pops up in Greek myths, Egypt, Aztec, all over the world. Now, all the legends say that anyone who can spot this comet will be led to their soulmate. But the Lover's Comet hasn't reappeared in the night sky in close to 2,000 years. In fact, the last time it was seen was when Vesuvius erupted in Pompeii in 79 AD. But even that's disputed since we have no physical record of it. - Do you think it's real? - As a matter of fact, I do. And I think it's coming back very soon. Ah, we are out of time. Everyone have a wonderful spring break and remember to check the night sky for the Lover's Comet. You never know. You just might see it. I sure hope I do. Excuse me. What are you two doing? - Uh, hey, Professor Alphard. It's a scavenger hunt for Professor Finway's history class. First one to find a real artifact gets to skip the final. - Okay, can you take your little treasure hunt somewhere other than the middle of campus, please? - Let's get out of here. - Apparently, we've hired Blackbeard as our newest professor. Wonderful. Ah, it's only a few days away, Olivia. I can feel it. I just really hope the comet shows up before I present to the board. - Do you do anything besides look into a telescope? - Okay, proving that the Lover's Comet is real could get my entire department more funding, maybe an observatory. - Sweetheart, you need to break up this relentless mission you're on with some fun. Maybe go on a date. - Order up. - I don't need to go on a date. I need to make a miraculous astronomical discovery... and I could easily date, if I wanted to. - Oh, really? Okay, prove it. Get a date right now. - Fine. Pick a guy. - That guy. Blue shirt. - Hmm? - Yeah. - Okay. - It could be. Oh. Hi. - Hey. - I'm Augie. - Heidi. - So, Heidi, do you always walk up to strange men in bars? - You're the first. But I have some questions. Favorite day of the week? - Ooh, Friday. Saturday's too obvious. - Beyond Burgers or golden retrievers? - Tie. Number? - Seven. It's lucky. No, can I have your phone number? Oh, uh, yes. Yeah. - So, Heidi, what do you do? - I teach at Longfield University. Astronomy. You? - Uh, let's continue this sometime soon. I'm really sorry. I have to go. - Yeah sure, no problem. - I'll call you. Later guys. - Do I still got it, or do I still got it? - Amazing. Flawless. Ugh, stunning. Total goddess. - I think I could like him. - Yeah, what's not to like? The guy looks like Thor in an Oxford. Oh, apple pie for pops. - Thanks very much. Good night. - Yes! That's my best friend! Whoo! - Hey, Dad. - I'm up! I'm up! - Apple pie. - Oh, goodie. - And a fork. - You're in a chipper mood. - I had a good night. - Oh, I haven't seen that face since that boy on the soccer team asked you to prom. The one with the frosted tips. - Don't remind me. It's not a big deal, but I did give a handsome stranger my phone number. - Ah, yes, the timeless start to any romance. Or murder mystery. - Very funny. - Hey, this pie is for me. - I get a bite for bringing it over. Mm. - Mm, not quite as good as your mom used to make. - Yeah. I miss her. - Me too. Are you ready for the meeting tomorrow? - Hardly. Every time I have to present budget concerns to the rest of the faculty, it's like I'm speaking Latin. - Hm, law school professors should have no problem understanding you then. Get it? Because legal terms are mostly in Latin, so the-- - I understood the joke, Dad. - You'll do great. - Having to talk about budgets, it's just so financial and political. It's not my cup of tea. Anyway, I'm gonna head home. I just wanted to stop by with some dessert because that's what the president of a prestigious university deserves. - You are correct. My job is hard. I deserve sugar. - Good night. - Night. Oh, and try not to break any hearts on your way home. - Now the Sicilian defense. - I was hoping to discuss budgetary concerns, specifically in my department. I've been noticing recently that the science departments are being neglected while other departments are thriving and given free reign. For example... Uh, Professor Finway has his students running around campus with digging equipment ripping up the grounds. Now, I can appreciate that brand-new faculty may not know all of the rules, but imagine if I had my students build their own observatory on the quad. - All I'm saying is that maybe it's time we reinvest in science. - History Department, August Finway. Care to defend yourself? - Present. Hi, everyone. I'm the notorious Professor August Finway. Some people call me Augie. I know I don't know most of you. I'm not really a fan of staff meetings, but look, I can't keep my students cooped up in a classroom, and sometimes they learn better on their feet. I'll let them know not to dig anywhere on campus. Okay? - Okay. Moving on. It's time to draw names for the two professors who will run our spring break program for high school seniors interested in applying to Longfield. - Hey, Finway. - Hey, Heidi. How's it going? - How come I didn't know you're also a professor here, Augie? - Well, I thought I said we would discuss it at length later, didn't I? - Why haven't I met you yet? - I just got here at the beginning of the semester. Plus, I'm in the history building, and you're all the way on the other side of campus. Big university. I'm not exactly the faculty mixer type. I'm a professor. You're a professor. What's the big deal? - Just seems like an important detail to leave out, don't you think? - What did you want me to say? Oh, how lovely that we're colleagues. Should we cease flirting immediately and discuss lesson plans instead? - Actually, yes. - You really think I'd stop a beautiful woman hitting on me with a downer like that? - August, how exciting that you and Heidi will be leading our spring program together. - Couldn't pass up an opportunity to help out. - Heidi and I are going to be making dinner tonight at my place. How about you join us? - I'm sure that's not necessary. - I'd love to. - Wonderful. 8:00 p.m. - Dad, seriously? - What? You're going to spend break together. You might as well get to know him. - Running the spring program is going to put a huge dent in my research time. - The fishbowl has spoken. You'll just have to manage. My rook appears to be stuck. - And running the program with August? - His teaching style is unorthodox, but that could be good for you. - Unorthodox? He's an archaeologist moonlighting as a professor. I read some articles about him after the meeting today. The guy is practically Indiana Jones. - - What's he doing at Longfield anyway? On his last expedition, he found a 10,000-year-old completely intact trade ship. Why would he give that up to teach here? Well, speak of the devil. - Side gate was open, so I just followed the noise. - August, welcome. Thanks for the wine. - Intense game. - Very. I'm my most difficult opponent. - Ah, rook to bishop four ought to do it. - Not bad. This year, we have eight seniors enrolled in the spring program. A remarkable group of kids. - Actually, my nephew, Bryce, is one of them. - Hm? - Really? - Yeah, part of the reason I took the job here was to be closer to him, help him get some direction. That's also why I left early last night, to pick him up from karate. - Ah, so you're the mysterious man at the bar. I've put together some writing exercises for the spring students to work on. Well, you two will have your hands full. Especially you Heidi, balancing your research. - What research? - I'm looking for the Lover's Comet. If I can prove that it exists, then maybe the board will funnel some money into the astronomy department and we could finally get an observatory. - The Lover's Comet. So you're trying to prove the fairy tale. - It's not a fairy tale. - We have no record of it physically existing, so it kind of is. - I don't need an artifact to prove that it exists. It's a theory. - Last I checked, people don't go to museums to hear theories. Besides, your comet hasn't been seen since-- - Pompeii, just before Vesuvius erupted. - And what do you have to prove it? - My calculations and my mother's research. She was working on this before she passed away a few years ago. - I'm sorry to hear that. - Thank you. She was very close to a breakthrough, and I just picked up where she left off. If any of the comet made landfall, it'd be in Pompeii. - So you think the myth about the lovers seeing the comet and escaping together just before the volcano erupted is true? - I'd be willing to bet that there are fragments of that comet in Pompeii as we speak. Maybe you could dig them up. - Charles, thank you so much for dinner. I'm really sorry. I have something urgent I need to attend to. - But we made bananas Foster. I nearly burned down the kitchen. - Next time. Thanks again. - That was odd. He just left. - Yeah, he has a habit of doing that. - Anyway, I think I like him. - You gotta be kidding. - Heidi! - Shh! It's a library. - Literally no one here. - Were you here all night? - Actually, yes, I was. - Why? - Everything you said fits. Lover's Comet, Pompeii. - What about it? - What if I told you I might have a piece of it? - How? - One of my first expeditions was a dig with my mentors in Pompeii. I found a rock that didn't quite match everything else I was finding. I briefly thought it could be something from space, but I abandoned that theory because my mentor, HP, wouldn't hear it. - Do you still have it? - Actually, yes. - Where? - It's in my office, I think. - We have a few hours before the spring break session. Show me. - Recent office change? - Nope. This is the one they gave me at the beginning of the semester. - That was two months ago. - Eh, I don't really see the point in getting settled in somewhere I might not stay. - What do you mean? Uh, look, teaching's more of a temporary thing for me. The position was only for a semester. Ideally, I get a curating gig in New York. I'm a tumbleweed. I need adventure, not cable knit and bookshelves. - What about your nephew? - Once he gets into college, I'll go back to my old life. Hold on. I remember packing it. Found it! Well? Is it? - It is. - I knew it! - Do you know what this means? It means I could finally make my mark on astronomy. This could be it. - What if-- hear me out. You need to bolster your research with some historical context, and I need a big finding to get the attention of the antiquity archives in New York City. - Okay. - Let me team up with you on your research, give it some historical backing, and then we send it to the museums when we finish. - Why? - Come on. How much more likely are you going to get that observatory with the flashy new history professor on board? - Okay, why would I need your help? - Because my guess is your research is densely scientific. - What's wrong with focusing on the science? - It needs a discovery, Heidi. That's what I do. - I'll think about it. We're going to be late for the spring session. - Right. Almost forgot about those misguided teenagers. - All right, guys. I was thinking we could start with an icebreaker. Everyone tell us your name, what you want to study at Longfield, and your favorite author. -I have a better idea. -Oh, do you? - Don't just tell us, show us. It's a library. Go find your favorite book in the stacks. Get on your feet! Up! - Where are you going? - We do everything our students do. Pick a book, Heidi. - Need help finding anything? - Yeah, I'm looking for the book about that kid who goes to the private school. He's real confused about what he wants. I can't remember what it's called. - Um, that could be most young adult novels. He's got a real funny name. Something like Hold, or-- - Holden Caulfield. - Yeah, that's it! - I think what you're looking for is "Catcher In The Rye." - Yes. Thank you. I'm Bryce by the way. - Heidi. - I see you met my nephew. - Yeah. - He's a good kid. He's just missing a compass at the moment. How so? - His mom works full-time, and his dad passed away when he was young. Now that he's applying to colleges, I felt like he needed somebody here to guide him, you know? - Mm-hmm. I figured that would be your choice. Homer's "Odyssey." Timeless classic. I was expecting Einstein or Newton from you. - Oh, I considered it, but "A Wrinkle in Time" always has a piece of my heart. Okay, let's all get to know one another by explaining why we chose our book. Who wants to start? - Bryce, you're up. Uh, I'm Bryce. I picked "Catcher in the Rye" just cause it's the first book I've read where the main character didn't feel fake. - How do you mean? - I don't know. He's just real upfront about not being understood. - Do you know what you'd like to study at Longfield? - No, I haven't really thought about it that much. - Well, let's use this next week to really dig in on why Longfield is the right choice. By the end of the session, you should all have a solid first draft of your personal essay. Think about these books. They say a lot more than you think. - Between my research and the spring session, it's going to be tough to get it all done. - You've been so wrapped up with this pursuit of the comet, I can't help but wonder is there something else going on? - Like what? - Well, I know how much stargazing meant to you and your mother. It was always your special thing. All those nights out, watching meteor showers and wishing on stars. Is this perhaps an attempt to relive all that? Are you psychoanalyzing me? - No, I'm looking for the comet because I want my students to have an observatory. It has nothing to do with losing mom. Actually, do you still have mom's old files? - Yes, why? I just want to see if she had something else on the Lover's Comet. Maybe she noticed something I didn't. Hi? - Charles invited me over for some chess. - Come in, come in. - What are you, some kind of chess master? - I never made grandmaster, but I am technically a candidate master. - What does that mean? - It means your dad's going to lose. - We'll see about that. - Well, I'm going to leave the two of you to your game of wits. Dad, mom's files? - In the cabinet outside my study. - Thanks. - So are you interested in him? I mean, I know working together complicates things a little bit, but you guys had such good chemistry at the restaurant. - Absolutely not, he is just helping me with my research. - I thought you said he was a history professor. - He has a piece of the comet. - What? Of your comet? - It's a long story. - What? - I actually have to go meet with him right now. - For a date? - What, no! To work. I'll see you later. - Okay, bye. - So my calculations are currently sitting in the .02753 realm, and in all my years of observing, I would say that this is the closest I've ever been to accuracy, or at least what I can comfortably call scientific accuracy. And as you can see, taking into account the triangulation of the position of mercury and if you consider the tilt of the earth's axis, we should see the reemergence of the comet-- - I'm bored. - Excuse me? - I said I'm bored. Let's get outside. It's stifling in here. That's better. Okay, so, as I was saying, given the environmental factors-- Ugh. Boo! - Oh, come on. - Why is it important? - It's a massive scientific breakthrough. Okay, maybe to you this all makes sense, but you have to convince the board on why this is all important and do it in a way they'll understand. Think of them as your students. - They're not my students. They're a bunch of older, wealthy people with strong opinions. - Right, but talk to them how you talk to your students. - Fine, Aiden 54P is a cosmic event so... - The Lover's Comet. - Aiden 54P is the scientific name. - But the myth is the draw. It's the Lover's Comet. No, the myth is only a way to place it in a certain time and place. - Oh, come on. Two lovers finding each other in a hopeless situation, escaping just in time? It's beautiful. - It's silly. - Aiden 54P doesn't have the same ring as the Lover's Comet. - Has anyone ever told you you're obnoxious? - Has anyone ever told you you're uptight? - This isn't going anywhere. - You need to sell the board on this project, and some random dead scientist's name followed by a weird number combination isn't going to do it. Lean into the myth. Trust me. It's sexier. The Lover's Comet. A tale of love, loss, adventure, and the stars. Whew. Ebert gives it two thumbs down. - Give me some time to work out the details. - August? Finished wasting away in this university system already? - Not yet, HP. I'm calling because I wanted to talk to you about a new endeavor. - What kind of endeavor? - A cosmic one. - You have my attention. - What if I told you I might have a way to prove that the Lover's Comet myth is real? - I'd wonder if you recently had a hit on the head. I'm serious, HP. There's an astronomer here who I'm working with. I think she's really onto something. I mean, she's one of the most stressed out people I've ever met in my life, but she's brilliant, HP. Intimidatingly so. - Enough about her. What have you got? - Too early to talk yet in detail, but what do you think? Is it worth a position at the museum? - Well, you prove something like this, there'll be plenty of openings here for you in New York. - Looks like I got work to do. - I mean, my data is perfect. Who is he to say that it's boring? - Shh. I'm trying to Zen. - When the comet shows up in a few days... - Heidi, please! Shush. If anyone needs yoga, it's you. - Feel that? Negative energy is radiating from over here. - Okay, okay, I'll clear my chakras or whatever. - Yes. Release it. Ow. Eh. - All I'm saying is there's more important things than the comet and the presentation. What's that supposed to mean? Look around. It's a beautiful day, enjoy it. Like that guy. - Oh, my gosh. Is that August? - What? - Hey. - Hi! This is my friend. - I'm Olivia. - August. Hatha flow yoga. - Yep. - You don't really strike me as the yoga type. - Trust me, she's not. That lady snapped my spine like a glow stick. - Okay. Hey, you know what? You should come by the restaurant tonight. My boyfriend Mike is trying out a new tasting menu, and we could use some new tastebuds. - Definitely. I'd love to. - Great, well Heidi will give you the details. - See you then. - What? He seems like a nice guy. And he looks really good in that running gear. -Don't remind me. -I will remind you. - Oh, Olivia, it looks so great in here. - I know, right? - Wait, are you sitting us together? - Duh, look at him. Go! - Hi. - Hi. I hope you don't mind I brought Bryce. - Of course not. Hey, Bryce. - Hey, sorry for crashing your date. - Oh, it's not a date. Did he say it was a date? He wishes it was a date. - Hi, everybody. Thank you so much for coming. First up, we have a lobster ceviche with a micro citrus salad. Enjoy. - Mmm. - How does he get the sauce to be foam? - Oh, Mike is a magician in the kitchen. - It looks like something from a cooking show. It's so cool. You know what? You should go check out the kitchen. Mike would love it. - Really? - Yeah. - Go. - So I was thinking that we could open with the data on cyclical astronomical-- Your insistence about discussing business is really affecting the taste of my lobster. - Okay. What should we talk about then? - Well, if we're going to work together, we should probably get to know each other. - What do you want to know? - I don't know. Uh, what got you into astrology? - Astrology is signs. Astronomy is stars. - You're not into that astrology stuff? - I'm a Virgo. - I don't know what that means. - It means I'm practical, so no. My mom was an astronomer. I guess I just wanted to finish what she started. - What about you? How did you get into archaeology? - Well, I had a dog growing up, Rex. - Okay. - And Rex loved digging holes in our backyard. And one day I go out, and Rex is just going intensely on this one hole. I was like, "There must be something in there." - What was in there? Well, I excavated our entire backyard. - Mm-hmm. I'm sure your parents were thrilled. - They were ready to tear their hair out, but ironically Rex discovered a dinosaur bone. - Hmm. - Shin bone. Yeah, good old Rex lived up to his name. Ever since, I've been hooked on it. - Well, here's to Rex. - Just hold the handle like you're shaking someone's hand. That way, the knife doesn't go anywhere. - That was nice of you to let Bryce stay with Mike in the kitchen. Ah, he was so excited about all the chopping and the fire. How could I say no? I just hope he comes home with all his fingers. Don't worry. He's in good hands. - Well, I guess I'll see you tomorrow. You know, an astronomer's day begins when the sun goes down. - Wait, wait, wait. Why'd I drag that thing all the way out here when you plan on using that? This little thing has helped me find my way for a long time, but we gotta bring the big guns. - See it? - Not yet. But it's on course. - Why the Lover's Comet? Out of all the things to study, why that? - My mom and I used to watch every meteor shower that we could together. She thought space was a kind of... magic. She really thought that the Lover's Comet was fated. Maybe I do too. - You don't really strike me as someone who believes in fated comets. Something out of a fairy tale. It's probably just a rock made up of the same chemicals and gases as every other comet, but who knows? - Yeah, who knows? What? - Nothing. - Here, give it a try. - Ah. - There you go. - Never saw stars like this in New York. I only ever got a good look at the sky when I was on a dig. - Well, it's good to look up every now and then. Remind yourself that we're all just a small speck of stardust in a vast stretch of space. - I like that. We're stardust. I stole it from Neil DeGrasse Tyson. Don't tell anyone. - No. My lips are sealed. What? What happened? - Sirius has moved. So has Rigel Victoris. - Is that not supposed to happen? - Hold on. - What? What's going on? Is this an asteroid situation? - If the sky is telling me what I think it is, then I'm fairly certain the comet will cross the southern sky the night before I present to the board. - Wow. I guess we've got some work to do. - We do. Hey. - It's locked. What do you mean, it's locked.? - Like I said, it's locked. - No! - Read the sign. Ah! - It's fine. We'll just go somewhere else. - No, I already offered my office to some of my students to use today. - Okay. We'll use my office. Just a small warning. It's a teeny bit messy. - A teeny bit messy? It's practically an episode of "Hoarders." - Oh, come on, it's not that bad. It's just a few boxes. - How do you even focus in here? - Side blinders and a lot of caffeine. - Do me a favor and empty those. - Why? - Because I can't work in here until we get some kind of control over the mess. - Just become one with the clutter. It works for me. - I refuse to be one with clutter. Happy? - Ecstatic. Keep going. Hey, hey! Oh, you're my new heaven There. Don't you feel better? - I never want to see another box again. Tomorrow, we're doing things my way. It still feels too unfocused. - I don't know how to make it more focused. - You have to figure out what you want and communicate that. Longfield is tough to get into. This essay will be make or break. You should narrow down a major. Keep working on it. - Yeah, I think that's a great start. So what exactly are we looking for? - I think there's something down here that can help us. I knew it! - What's it say? - It's a prophecy foretold by Asteria, goddess of fallen stars. Once a millennia, two fated lovers will be led to one another by the light of the goddess's hand. - Goddess's hand? That's probably a reference to the comet. Right, but if it's once a millennia, that means it's a periodic comet. And if it's cyclical, then it would also have appeared 1,000 years after Pompeii. 1021. What happened in 1021? - You're the history buff. You tell me. What happened around then that could be tied to a celestial event? - It wouldn't be far from the Norman Conquest in England. Maybe there's something there. I vaguely remember William the Conqueror had experience with a comet, but I'd have to research it more. - You know, I couldn't help but notice Bryce getting frustrated today. - I just wish he'd pick something and stick with it. I put my career on hold to move here and help him. He's just wasting time. - He's still a kid. - He has potential. The only thing stopping him is a lack of focus. - Not everyone is like us, August. - How do you mean? - Not everyone knows what they want to be their whole life. We were lucky that we both knew early on what we wanted to do with our lives. Some people just take longer figuring it out. Have patience. A big part of education is figuring it all out. I always saw university as a place to hone in on your craft, start a career. For you, yes, but for some students it's a time to meet themselves. - I feel like people should follow where their passion leads them. - There's nothing wrong with staying in place and just learning. - Hey, you know, August's nephew came by the restaurant again today. - Really? Yeah, he said he wanted to learn how to sous vide. - Mm, I'm not sure August is going to like that. - Why not? - I think he really wants Bryce to just buckle down on Longfield. - Oh. - Something for you ladies to snack on. - Ah! - Michael! Babe, that's so sweet. Thank you. - Of course, babe. - Mmm. - Well, I'll leave you ladies to it. What? No, stay. Hang out with us. - Uh, I can't. I have something to work on. Enjoy. Well, see you later. - What's with him? - He's acting so weird. - So weird. - He said he's working on a secret project, but he won't tell me what it is. Since when does Mike keep secrets? What do you think he's doing? - I don't know, but I don't like it. Olivia... The guy slept in the hospital for four days when you got your appendix out. He just brought us an artfully designed s'mores kit. I don't think you have anything to worry about. He's probably just figuring out a way to mix peanut butter with expensive beef. Yeah, I guess. - I would love to have the kind of relationship you two have one day. - Well, you know, you can have that if that's what you want. - Yeah. Work is just my focus right now. Hey, back off my mallow! - So I've been going through my Mom's PhD, and so far, there's lots of good stuff on the nature of these types of comets but nothing specifically on our comet. - Was she focused on the Lover's Comet? - She researched it, but it's so weird. It's like she's avoiding it completely in her PhD. - I'm sure it's in there. You'll find it. - Wow. You hung up art and everything. - It's probably crooked or something. - No, it looks great. - Thanks. I mean, I had a little help. Speaking of, now that we have a solid first draft, what would you think about me sending our progress to my mentor, HP? He might be able to give us some tips. - Sure, if you think it's the right move. - Everything okay? - Yeah. It's just Olivia. She and Mike finally set up the new ping-pong tables at the restaurant, and she was just wondering if we wanted to play around. But we should probably keep working. I mean, I still have 250 pages of my mom's research to go through. - We should go. It'll be fun. - Really? - Yeah. Just let me email HP. Did I mention that I was a ping-pong champion as a kid? No way. - You should see my backhand. Try to keep up, stardust. Shall we? - You're on. - This one is for the money. Yes! - How long have you guys been together? - Since we were kids. Um, I'm, you know, planning on proposing soon. But, I mean, the idea of all these people watching, it's... - You're nervous about giving a speech? - Yeah. My forte is pesto and shucking oysters, you know? Not writing soliloquies. Actually,Heidi said that you have a flair for this sort of stuff. Do you want to give me some pointers? She said that? - Mm-hmm. Her exact phrase was uh, "The students hang on to his every word." Okay, let's see what you got, champ. - You ready? - Game on. - Here we go. - Good shot. - So? Spill. - What? - Don't play dumb. What is going on between you and August? - We just work together. That's it. - I'm serious? There's nothing going on. - Heidi, I've known you since the third grade, and the last time I saw you look at a boy like that was when we went to the NSYNC concert and Justin Timberlake touched your hand and you refused to wash it for a week. - Oh, it was five days tops, not a week. - Just admit it. You like him. - He's not as awful as I thought, okay? - I knew it! - He is planning on getting a job in New York City. He's only here to help his nephew and then back to his old life. And I need to focus on my work. - Okay, so why don't you just tell him that? Just be honest. - Olivia, he's my coworker. - A lot of people date their coworkers. Mike and I work together. I just-- I'm tired of watching you let work cast such a big shadow over everything else. August is a friend and a colleague and nothing more, okay? -Good shot. -There you go. It's left-handed, see? Still got it. - Okay, okay, I admit it. - Sixth grade regional table tennis champ. Those were the days. - Yeah, you peaked early. Excuse you! - I'm kidding. That's me over there. - Thanks again for letting me crash your friend night. And for freeing me from my prison of boxes. No problem. I had fun. - You know, this is the first time I'm not living out of a suitcase. It's actually really nice. Thank you. - I should head in. Good night. - Good night. First new message. - August, read the work. You are onto something big. Listen, I'll be up near you the day after tomorrow. Let's meet up to discuss. - "The Lover's Comet, while an exciting fantasy, "is just that. "After years of exhaustive study, "I've concluded that this elusive body "is likely a solar flare or large asteroid mistaken for a comet and given greater significance than warranted." Mom, no. No, this can't be right. - Twenty years of private lessons, and I still play like I've only recently developed motor skills. Dad, did it ever complicate things that you and Mom worked together? Did it ever slow you down? - No, your mom and I always agreed that we wouldn't stand in the way of each other's goals. - I know, but when she got sick. - I wanted to be home. She never pressured me. It was my choice. - What about fate? I always thought she believed in that stuff. - She did. - It certainly doesn't seem like it. - You finished her PhD, didn't you? - Why didn't you tell me that she stopped believing in the Lover's Comet? - Because she didn't. - What do you mean? - Did I ever tell you that I considered taking a job at Yale? - What? When? - Early in my career. Your mom was at Longfield University doing her PhD, and I was restless. I wanted to get away from this place. Yale came sniffing, offered me dean. - Really? What happened? - I turned them down. I realized I had everything I needed already. - Your mom spent that whole year not sleeping, staying out all night looking at the sky, begging for that comet to come out. - So she just gave up? - No. She never stopped looking. She just couldn't prove it, is all. And her research had to reflect that. She still believed in it right up until the end. You don't have to see something to believe it, Heidi. Ice cream? - Yes, please. - With an observatory, the astronomy department could begin to attract more majors. And having been the institution that fostered research on the Lover's Comet, we can expect an influx of new students interested in astronomy. Is everything okay? - How sure are you about the comet? - Why? - If you had to put a percentage on it, how certain are you that the comet will pass by the night before the board meeting? - It's a comet. They're reliable to a point, but there's always a chance I could be wrong. Though this is what my calculations have said for close to a year now. Still my mom never saw it, so... What's going on? - Aren't you worried that it won't show up? What if everything that we're doing doesn't work out? - That's always a possibility. My mom was a genius, and if she couldn't find it, then... Aw, jeez. - Come on. - Where are we going? - We need to get out of our heads. - How? - Just come on. I have an idea. - But what about our work? - What's that you always say? On your feet, up. - What are we doing? There's a new temporary exhibit at the library I want to check out. - That doesn't open until after spring break. - Remember you told me to make it fun? - Yeah? Hey. This is insane. Shh! Just stay down. Still stressed? - Not so much. Thank you. It's like looking back in time. - Very much so. That's Asteria. Greek goddess of falling stars. - That's our girl? Yep. Miss Stardust herself. - Hey! You shouldn't be in here! - Run! Okay, I think we lost him. - It's not funny! I can't believe we just did that. - Me neither. Oh, I haven't done anything like that in years. - You are terrifying when you're trying to be fun. But thank you for using my methods against me. I needed that. - Mm-hmm. - Can I ask you something? - Sure. - What if it is fate, the comet? - Well, the idea of our fates being written in the cosmos isn't exactly new. We've just forgotten over time. - What do you mean? - We live in a world full of light pollution. We don't ever really see the sky. - So you think the stars could spell out our lives? - Not exactly, but I do think there's something to be said for using the stars as a guide. You're a historian. How often did people throughout history look to the cosmos for signs of their fates? - What's that? - It's Latin. It means, "They marvel at the star." I dug around the other day after our conversation in the reserve. It's from the Norman Conquest. Halley's Comet flew over the battlefield, and William the Conqueror believed it to be an omen for the impending victory. Remember how you said that the comet would have to appear early in the 11th century for the prophecy to be true? - So you're saying William the Conqueror didn't actually see Halley's Comet. It was our comet. - It would give a scientific explanation for fate. Actually yes, it could be. And it would also explain why my mom missed it. She was studying it on the wrong cycle. Heidi, this is why your research is so special. This comet could actually mark significant events. It could be a form of fate. - You're right. It's a risky angle, but why shouldn't my research be about fate? - It's great to see you taking risks. - I just--I really feel like I've finally been set free. I've spent so long being terrified of taking risks or any wrong steps. - Well, I think the board will be very impressed. I can see August has had quite the effect on you. He has. I think maybe it's time for me to start making my class more fun for my students. Just get them to be more active in their studies. A new observatory would be a big help. Just get them up on their feet. - It's good to see you thinking big. And tell August it would be great if he would let me win a game, you know, every now and then. - I doubt that's going to happen, Dad. - Okay. Let's try this again. - Okay, Olivia, babe, you're awesome. Ah. - We can do better than that. On your feet. - Words just aren't my thing. - Why don't we try this a different way. Okay, here. I'll be Olivia. - Seriously? - Yeah, just--I'm Olivia. Talk to me the way you'd normally talk to her. Come on. Olivia, you're, uh... - What? - You're... You're a guy, okay? This is going to be a disaster. Her party is tomorrow. What was I thinking? In front of all those people? I should just ask her in private. - Mike, breathe. Okay, stop thinking about the audience. This isn't about them. This is about you and Olivia. - I know, but it's-- - No buts. Why do you want to marry her? - Because she's the best. - Why? - Because... Because every day, her hair is different and she always smells like fresh lavender and butter, and she always sprays my pillow with her perfume. You know, she does all this stuff that I don't even think I'm supposed to notice. But she still does it. - Now, we're getting somewhere. - Thanks. Uh, Bryce, I don't think there's enough rosemary. - Really? I added three sprigs. - Let's try. Okay. Wow. Wow, uh, that's a perfect amount of rosemary. August, try it. - Wow. - Mm-hmm. - Kid's got talent. - He does. - Really? Hey, I know I don't say it often, but I'm really proud of how hard you're working. It's great to see your passion coming through. - Thanks, Uncle August. Hey, it's not finished. Hey, respect the chef. - August, calling to confirm our meeting tomorrow. - Oh right, of course. - Ah, you forgot. - No, I didn't forget. Sorry, it's been a busy few days. We're on. - Great. See you tomorrow morning. - Morning everyone. To start, I want all of you to complete this writing assignment, and then you will turn in the final drafts of your essays. Hi. Where are you? - I'm so sorry. I completely forgot. My mentor, HP, is in town. I'm meeting up with him about our project. Oh. - And this could be big for us. Published, the observatory, maybe I'd get a job in New York. I'm really sorry to miss a session. - Totally. It's okay. - I'll see you tonight? At Olivia's party? - Definitely. - Look, I'm really sorry again for the last-minute cancel. I'm just juggling a lot, and this meeting skipped my mind. - It's okay. I'll handle the session. See you tonight. - August, my boy. - HP, thanks so much for coming. - Professorship looks good on you. This is your office? Yep. Perhaps academia has domesticated you more than I thought. - Well, things change. - Yeah. - Do you remember that dig we did in Pompeii? The rock I found? - Vaguely. - You said it was a piece of junk. - Eh, sometimes I'm wrong. - Often? - Let's not go that far. So about this comet of yours. It's due to cross the southern sky on the 15th, yes? - Yeah, tomorrow night. - Well, I have to tell you my colleagues at the Antiquity Archives in New York City are thrilled with the research. We want to publish it. - When? - As soon as possible. Preferably before it whizzes across the sky. - But it's not finished. - August, let me make this as plain as I can. This project is your way in. We can finance your next dig, whatever you want. August Finway, discoverer of the Lover's Comet. - I'm not the sole discoverer. In fact, Heidi, the astronomer I've been working with, has done the vast majority of the work. - But you're the main draw here. - I'm not going to take credit for her work. She's the visionary here, not me. In fact, if it wasn't for her, that comet fragment would still be buried at the bottom of a box, and I'd still think it's a piece of junk. - August, be serious. You can't waste your best years stuck in some dreary campus surrounded by hack teachers when you could be on the cutting edge of New York City or somewhere exotic digging artifacts out of the earth. - It's not dreary here. The people aren't hacks, they deserve our respect. Just because people like you and me get to jet around the world digging things up doesn't make us any better than the people here. - Down boy, I meant no offense. - I'm not publishing until Heidi gets the credit she deserves. Got it? - Clear as day. - Good work everyone. Have a great evening. You deserve it. Hey Bryce. Do you have a moment to talk about your essay? - Sure. - Maybe I'm overstepping, but I get the sense that you're writing what you think people want to hear, and not what you actually want. - We're supposed to pick a major, so I just picked history. - It's not about the major. Remember how you said you liked Holden Caulfield because he was honest and didn't just pretend in order to please everyone? August loves you, and he's only trying to help when he pushes you to focus, but you're allowed to chart your own path. - You know, I have really been liking cooking with Mike. - Great, let's start there. Write about that. - I can write about that? - Yes. - Cool. - Thanks for the help. I just assumed you'd be working all day. - Oh, August had to cancel. He's meeting up with his old mentor to talk about jobs in New York. - Oh. And you're okay with that? - Yeah, it's fine. I expected this. - Well, expecting it doesn't make it suck any less. - This was always the deal. My students get an observatory. He gets the job he actually wants. - So you're really okay with him leaving? - Our careers are more important right now. This has been my sole focus for so long, why would that change now? - Because August is a great guy, and you two are a good fit together. - Well, it's just not meant to be. What else do we need to get? - Nothing, this is it. Mike was very insistent on me not doing any unnecessary work today. He barely let me get the flowers. Keep it up, keep it up! - Is that? - Ah. - Come on, keep up, champ. - Yeah. Ah. - Since when does Mike run? - The only time I've ever seen him run is to get a soufflé out of the oven so it wouldn't burn. - I once saw him chase after Bobby Flay at a conference, but even that was more of a speed walk. Ugh, he is acting so weird. - Totally. Hey, I have to head home and do some work before the party tonight. - Okay. - Tomorrow night's the big night. - Ooh! You go get that comet, girlie! Mike, Mike, Mike, Mike. - I wish that you would... - Isn't it gorgeous? - It's beautiful. Have fun. - About me - Whoa, look at you. - Not so bad yourself. - Yeah? - So I noticed some suspicious activity earlier today. - What kind of suspicious activity? - Eh, just a certain someone running with Mike. - Ah, he was stressed, so we ran it off. - Stressed about what? Whew. Hi, everybody. Uh, first off, I just want to wish Olivia a very, very happy birthday. Liv, would you join me up here? Look at her. Olivia, um... I've loved you since we were 10. I loved you through your braces phase, and she loved me even when I had a bowl cut and looked like a mushroom. You're it, Olivia. You've always been it. I've known it since kindergarten, I knew it at junior prom... and I knew it that year that we stayed in my parents' garage to save up for our restaurant. Olivia... Will you marry me? - Yes, of course! - I don't know if you guys heard that, uh, but she said yes! Whoo! - Whoo. - Did you... - He needed some help, so I helped him. - Nice. - So I've got some news. HP wants to publish our work. - Wow, that's amazing! Does this mean that you're going to go to New York? - I mean, Longfield's growing on me. My department said I could continue teaching. - Hmm. - I'm still deciding. - And for so long, I've fought for a life I've never known - No, you guys stop. - No, it's my party. I can clean up! - Get out of here. Go celebrate. - Aww. Thank you guys. Come on, fiancée. - Thank you. Have fun. - We may come to regret this. - No kidding. Ugh, It's locked. - No way. Should we call Olivia? - It's 2:00 a.m. Let them sleep. We'll survive the night. And tomorrow night's the big night. Aiden 59J. - 54P. The Lover's Comet does sound better. - Mm. - Don't gloat. - Have you figured out where you're going to watch it from? - I'm gonna go down to the bird sanctuary. No light pollution. Unobstructed views of the southern sky. I hope it shows. - It will. - Oh, I have something to show you. - What's this? - Something Bryce and I worked on today. - "Cooking Up My Future." He wrote this? - Yeah. - Wow. I never realized he had this in him. I think I was just so focused on trying to steer him that I was hindering him. No, you just were doing what you thought was best. - You're a good teacher. Thank you. - It was nothing. - No, it's everything, actually. You're really good at what you do, and you don't have to rely on a bunch of gimmicks to get through to people. I should do that. - No. Gimmicks can be fun. I think I was just so caught up in doing everything by the book that I forgot to make my work fun. You reminded me. Shooting star. Did you see it? - I think I did. - What's going on? - I don't know. - Why does the entire world think my research belongs to you, August? - I don't know. - "August Finway, noted historian and archaeologist, "may be hot on the trail of the elusive Lover's Comet. "He believes tonight may be the night the ancient fireball "will pass through the night sky for the first time in nearly a thousand years." What is this August? - HP must have... - Was this your plan? Was it? Just use me for my work and then steal it so you can take off for some better gig in New York? No, Heidi, I swear. I didn't mean to do any of this. - I should've trusted my gut about you. I mean what else should I expect from some guy who takes a teaching job he has absolutely no intention of staying in? - That's not fair. - This is my work, August. While you have been out there jetting around, I've been here toiling every day. You think you can just waltz in here and take that from me? Years. Years of my life, August. I have given years to this. - I'm sorry. - No. No, no, you don't get to be sorry. How dare you? Go to New York. Keep running away, August. Just keep on chasing the next big thing, the next big discovery. - That's all I am to you, isn't it? Just some transient guy chasing clout. You're right. I do have better things in New York. I don't know what I was thinking, languishing away in some sad college town. - What are you folks doing up here? - Hold that door, please. - I'll call the Antiquities Archives in New York City and give them a piece of my mind. - No, I need to see the comet tonight. There's no point until I see the comet. I can't believe that August did this. - Me either. I'll bet it was his mentor. HP was always a scoundrel. He and I have been up for the same job a number of times. I caught him trying to toss out my résumé after an interview we both were at. And it's not the first time he's lifted research that didn't belong to him. His reputation is less than stellar. - Still, August let this happen. I'm sorry, Heidi. I mean, who does he think he is with his rooks and his sneaky bishop moves? Do you want to go hit a few tennis balls? - Oh, no, I need to pack to get to the bird sanctuary in time for the comet tonight. I'm gonna look like an even bigger fraud in front of the board tomorrow if I don't finish this. - It takes strength to believe in something others don't, and even more to prove it. Your mom would be proud. Now go find that comet. Thank you. - Oh, it's you. - Sir, hear me out, please? - Why should I? - Because I care about Heidi. She deserves better, and I want to make this right. Please. - Well, you better have an A+ explanation for yourself, kid. - August, have you given my offer any thought? - I have. - And? I'll take the job, but I have one condition. I'll call you back. Is it true? Did you steal Heidi's research? - Not exactly. - She's a nice lady. She deserves better. - She absolutely does. - All you do is think about yourself and your stupid career. - Read your essay. I'm sorry, Bryce. I shouldn't have put so much pressure on you. - You read that? - Me coming here trying to wedge you into some college, it's the wrong thing. I'm sorry. I just-- I want you to be successful. I'm not meant to be here. - I like having you here. - You do? - I never really got why you were all obsessed with this school stuff, but I think I understand it more now. - What about cooking? - I want to do that, but I want an education too. I can do both. - Yes, you absolutely can. - So you're leaving. - Yeah, they offered me a position in New York. - Bummer. - I'll visit as much as I can. - Promise? - Yeah, I promise. Come on. - Come on. Come on, come on. - Come on. Come on, come on. - Wonder what the board will think of this. - Well, all set? - Science is all about trial and error, right? - That's the spirit. Go get em, kiddo. - With an observatory, of course, these calculations would be much easier to formulate. I know you all came here today thinking I was going to regale you with exciting news about the Lover's Comet, but I can't give you that. I actually had hoped to prove to you that fate exists. I know that sounds completely unrealistic. I would love to actually one day find this Lover's Comet, but astronomy is about much more than just flashy discoveries. I mean, humans have been looking to the night sky for answers about their own lives for millennia, and I think our university needs more of that. Because our students come here to find themselves. This comet helped me find myself. Please consider funding an observatory, not because you find me impressive but because you believe in my students. My favorite book, "A Wrinkle in Time," taught me that you don't have to understand something in order for it to be real. So just because I don't have all the data and charts right now doesn't mean I'll stop believing. My mother never did, so I won't either. Thank you. Not what I was expecting. - I thought it was brilliant. - I'm just disappointed. - About the comet or August? - The second one. - There's more to this story than you think. Sometimes people do things without realizing. - What do you mean? It's not my story to tell, kiddo. Hear him out. What are you doing here? I am... I'm off to New York. I want to apologize again and say goodbye. - So you got the job you wanted? - Lead curator for the Ancient Greek Department. They're funding an expedition too. - Wow. Congrats. - I'm sorry about the comet. - It's okay. - I spoke to HP and the scientific journals. I told them I wouldn't take the job unless he got them to print retractions. - Thank you. - I promise I never intended to take anything from you. - Oh, hey. Here. - Oh, you should keep it. - No. It's yours. - I really hope you prove fate one day, even if it didn't work out this time. Stardust. - Me too, Augie. So when's the new job start? - It's the 18th. - Tomorrow? No, two days from now. It's a leap year, remember? - Leap year. - Yeah. - I have to go. I'm really sorry. Bye! - To the airport, please. What did she mean by "leap year"? It's tonight. Hey, forget the airport. You know where a bird sanctuary is around here? - Hey, Dad, what's up? - I just heard from the board. You're getting an observatory. - You're joking. How is that possible? - Well, you may have had some help from the history department. - August? - I didn't want to tell you earlier in case it didn't work out. - Wow. - He cleared it up with the board. They know the research was yours. Congrats, honey. Have a good night. Thank you. I'll see you tomorrow. - Great plan, August. Just run around some random nature sanctuary until you find her. Brilliant. Heidi! Heidi! Heidi, lost in the woods! Little help here? - August? - Hi. - Hi. What are you doing out here? - I don't want to leave, Heidi. I want to stay with you. You're my fate. If we're all stardust, then I'm made out of the same star you are. If you could just forgive me, I think-- - No way. - Okay. Wow. Harsh, but I deserve that. I shouldn't be here. I just thought I would try and-- - No, August. - Heidi, I get it. - No, August, look! - Is that? - The Lover's Comet. - It's real. It's real. Heidi, you did it. - No, August, we did it. I know what you did for me with the board. I don't want you to leave either. I just--I thought New York was where you wanted to be. - You know you can't see stars in New York. So you think I can get my old job back? Just no more archeological digs on campus, okay? Deal.
