Well, we might as well eat here. Then move on. I could stand some. You're still worried about it, aren't you? Pat, you quit your job as sheriff. My father can't ask for more than that. He'd ask for a lot more than that, Roy. After all, it's his daughter that I'm marrying. You think I'd had ride all the way from Abilene to New Mexico to get you if sis wasn't sure? She wanted to marry me before, Roy. This time it's different. Pa won't get in your way. You left your reputation back in Lincoln County. Pat Garrett, killer with a badge. You know, it takes an awful lot of riding to lose a reputation like that. What do they expect you to do? Bring in Billy the Kid and those other gunslingers wrapped up in pink ribbon? I think we better get moving. Hit bad, Roy? I can't tell. I feel numb. Can you make it to Abilene? Heh. Don't think I'd hold up the wedding, do you? Who do you figure did it? Well, whoever it was, it was meant for me. Is that what you always gonna be thinking? There's always gonna be somebody waiting to kill you? Look, Roy, I've put lot of men in boot hill, and I put a lot more in jail. There's always someone who's gonna try to even the score. Nobody will know you in California. That's what I'm figuring on. For your sis's sake. Harv! Harv Logan! It's your brother. Give me a hand, Blackjack. Let's get him inside. Easy. Now, who did it, Lonnie? Easy. Pat Garrett. Garrett in Kansas? Where was he heading? Which way? Toward Abilene. Abilene. Trouble. Ah. What happened? Don't get sore, Sundance. Billy the Kid was my friend. Garrett killed him. You tried to bushwhack Pat Garrett alone? You know why I wanted to talk to you boys? Forty men from the Wild Bunch will be in this area anytime now. Butch Cassidy's gang? I sent for them. There's half a million dollars to be had and it can't be taken without a big outfit. A half million dollars? That's right. Well, he's got 40 men. Why does he need us? Cassidy doesn't know how to get the money. I do. You know, you shouldn't have missed Garrett, kid. Ah, one man can't bother us. He can organize Abilene. Just like he organized the law in half the towns in Lincoln County. All right, kid, we'll finish what you started. If Cassidy or any of his boys show up you tell them where we are and why. Come on. Roy. Hi, sis. Is the doctor around? Oh, he's at the McDonald house. Hurry. Sorry about this, Lorna. He stopped a bullet that was meant for me. This bed. Dad will be here in a minute, Roy. I got this far. I'll be all right. Cody McDonald smashed his finger on the anvil. So Dad had to go-- Whoa. Eight months since you two have seen each other and all you can talk about is the blacksmith? How does your, uh... How does your father feel about my coming for you? It's no use lying over it, Pat. But I'm going with you to California. We'll have a wonderful ranch and live our own life. I'm figuring on that. Pat. Glad to see you, doctor. Hm, I'm sure. Dad. How did it happen? Oh, it was-- It was an accident, that's all. Of course. I have often wondered which gets there first: the accident or Pat Garrett? I'll be at the house, Pat. When you finish here I want to talk to you. All right, Lorna. It's a clean wound. You'll be able to go to the wedding. I wasn't so sure you were figuring on one. It's what Lorna wants. You've changed, doctor. You think my criticism was of you. It wasn't. I know your kind of man is necessary for this kind of country. Perhaps in a way I can even see that law and order have to come on the heels of a fast gun and dead men. When I stood between you and Lorna, the only thing I wanted was to keep her away from the danger and cruelty of guns and dead men. My job was to keep a lot of people away from it, doctor. And I won't stand in your way this time. Thank you. I'll be over with Lorna if there's anything you want. Blackjack, Carter, you keep your eyes open. Let's see if we can find out where Garrett is. What is it, Pat? Aren't you sure now? Lorna, your father wants a guarantee that you're going to be happy. Well, I-I can't give it to him. I can't give it to you. Oh, Dad's just worried about me, Pat. He's afraid of this country. I think most of the people who live here are. They stay here because they want something. Good farmland, good grazing acreage, gold. Your father certainly doesn't want any of those. No, but he wants something, Pat. He wants to feel he's worth the air he breathes. When the government asked for doctors to go West and offered him this hospital, he jumped to the chance. He felt it was really an opportunity to help people. Yeah, well, he's got what he wants. He should be satisfied. Yes. But the West is still a wild animal to him, Pat. He hasn't lived with it like you have. And how do you feel about living with it? I want to be with you, wherever it is. I love you, Pat. I gotta see Pat Garrett. Garrett, I'm McAfee, town marshal. Trouble's looking for you. More than you can handle. It's all over town already. Gunslingers, five of them. All staked out at the El Dorado. Know any of them? All of them. Seen their posters, plenty. Harvey Logan, Sundance Kid. They've all killed more than their share. Sundance, Harry Longabaugh? That's the one. Then there's Blackjack Ketchum. Ben Kilpatrick, Jake Carver. What do you suppose they are after? Five of the top gun hawks in the territory aren't here for my benefit. Three of them are inside the saloon asking questions about you and the other two are outside just watching. What you gonna do about it, marshal? Me? Yeah. Garrett, I don't even want to know you're in town. Look, look, I'm marshal here. Let me give you a friendly warning: get out. Grab a horse and get. You don't take those five now, Abilene will become a calling stop for every gunman in Kansas. My getting killed won't change that. He's right, Pat. Please leave now. How many do you suppose they'd kill if there were no law here at all? Get your shotgun. What? You'll move in on the two outside and take their guns away. That's what you're being paid to do. All right, ma'am, I'm-- I'm scared. I got a right to be scared. He must be too, marshal. You men looking for Pat Garrett? What crazy fools are making all that noise? It's Pat Garrett. Garrett? The El Dorado. He's quit firing. Maybe he's been hit. Harv, Sundance, what's going on in there? Drop that gun, sonny. Just climb down nice and slow. The whole town will be on us now. We gotta get to those horses. Let's go. Hold it. If you think I won't shoot you in the back, just try something. All right, outside. Slow. Hi, Pat. Oh, hi, Buffalo. Hey, thanks for the help. When you go for haul you don't do it retail. Glad you're in town. Cody, this wasn't your fight. Could be we'll pay you back somehow. All right, let's move. Lots of fellows have had a whack at that, Sundance. I guess you can hunt just so many buffalo, then get to be the buffalo's turn. Got knocked off my horse in a stampede. This old bull decided to go for a walk on my ribs. Busted 'em pretty good. The boys yanked me into the hospital here yesterday. You gonna marry Doc Pardee's girl? Ah, this should be enough for the marshal's report. You didn't answer me. I don't have the answer yet, Bill. You three ready to say why you came in to Abilene? We were thirsty, Garrett. We were having a drink. Anything you wanna know other than that? No. Really doesn't make any difference. You'll probably hang anyway. Mr. Garrett. I'm Mayor Coleman. You have the deep and sincere thanks of this community for your courageous capture of these criminals. You don't have to thank me, Mr. Mayor. McAfee said they were gunning for me. I've made a report there. Marshal can make it official when he gets back. The reason we're here is in the hope, Garrett, that you'll make it official. Oh? Abilene is growing. We could use a man like you here. Garrett, will you take over as marshal? Well, mayor, I gave up being a lawman in New Mexico. I see no reason to change my mind in Kansas. But you're-- You're not just going to leave those murderers here? No, I'm sending for Bat Masterson and Wyatt Earp. They'll take them back into Dodge. Court's in session there. Folks around here will be able to sleep lot easier. Well, how do you feel, marshal? He's all right. Just a flesh wound. You did a good job. Thanks. Put a burr under a saddle horse he'll jump, because you put a couple under mine. My thanks to you. You'd better notify them in Denver and Salt Lake. About the three of those and about the two dead ones. I think they all have posters on them. Sure. Pat, what do you think about those gun hawks in there? You're wondering why the five of them would get together just to get me, aren't you? They've never operated together before. Something's happening around here. Something we don't know about. If there's anything more to learn Wyatt and Bat can handle it. Maybe you should've taken that marshal job. You're worrying about making Doc Pardee and Lorna happy. Well, you've never done anything but work for the law. You think you're gonna be happy sitting in the sun in California? I'm going on over to the telegraph office, and send for Wyatt and Bat. You tell Lorna I'll be back in a few minutes. How long you figure it'll take this wire to reach Wyatt Earp in Dodge City? Oh, about a couple of hours. Thanks. You didn't put down your return address, Mr. Garrett. That's right, I didn't. Oh, I thought it would never end. I couldn't go out there. I couldn't go out on the street. Oh, Pat, if you'd been hurt... I know, I know, Lorna. We'd better talk. Your father was right. He's been right all along. I thought by quitting my job as sheriff I could walk away from anything that would hurt you, Lorna. But I can't. I can't yet. It's too soon. But will waiting help? It won't, Pat. You'll expect me to stop you from being afraid. But the way things are right now I'd be more afraid than you. Every time I'd see a man with a gun I'd think he's aiming right at my back. I'd be scared. Scared because of you. I couldn't stand that and neither could you. But, Pat, I don't think it would be like that. We could try. Lorna, please. Oh, Pat, we've got to try. No. No, we must-- We must wait. I've got to go to California. I've got to start a new life. If I do, I'll be back and then we'll be married. You've been thinking of this all along, haven't you? Ever since Roy was shot. Lorna, try to see it my way, please. I should never have asked you to give up your job. I should have gone to New Mexico with you. No, no, no. That would have been worse. You think you're different from my father, but you're not. You're the same. He needs his hospital to make him feel he's accomplishing something. Well, with you it's your job. I saw it today, Pat. Even without your badge, you were the lawman. You took over. You acted as though you still had your badge on you. I'm leaving the first thing in the morning, Lorna. Wyatt Earp and Bat Masterson will be in tomorrow. Tell them that I've gone on. Pat. Pat? I'll wait for you, Pat. I'll have to. I love you and that gives me no choice. It's a big outfit. Make out anything yet? There's no cattle around, Bat. Can't be a roundup. Who do you think it is? One of them is George Curry. Curry? That's the Cassidy gang. The last report we had Cassidy had been spotted in Utah and Wyoming in quite a spell. It must be something pretty big to draw Cassidy out of his territory. And the garrison left Fort Dodge after the Apaches. Had to leave this area wide open. They might know that. Ah, there's no money in Abilene. I don't know why Cassidy would come down here. There's something. There's gotta be. We better get to Abilene. Garrett. Don't try that. Now sit right there, real quiet. Well, well. Pat Garrett, killer. Without a badge. What have you been doing, Cassidy? Reading the New Mexico papers? Some of them said you're even too tough to be a lawman. Shot first, asked questions afterward. One way of saving the state some money. Maybe we don't think that's so funny, Garrett. Lonnie Logan told me that five of the boys went into Abilene looking for you. They didn't come back. Now where are they? Well, maybe we could trade some answers. What are you doing so far east? I said, where are my five men? Or do we have to beat it out of you? He won't talk, Butch. I told you. Give me a gun and let me finish him. Shut up. I've taken all I intend to off of guys who act on their own. But Sundance figured Garrett would get in our way. It was worth going after him. Not worth a half a million dollars. And that's what it's liable to cost us if we don't meet that train. You making it rough on yourself, Garrett. We need the Sundance Kid. We need him real bad. And you're gonna tell us where he is, or we'll even get rougher. How can I tell you where he is when-- When I don't know? Five top guns just don't disappear in thin air, friend. Don't suppose Sundance changed his mind. Wants that half a million himself? Sundance has got more sense. He's got the information, we got the men. And none of us have much time to wait around. Did you hear that, Garrett? We don't have that kind of time. But we do have time enough to hold out longer than you. That much we do have. Bat, Wyatt. Sure glad to see you fellows. Old times. Acting like I got some lit dynamite in that cell. You have, Mr. McAfee. Cassidy and his gang have this town locked in. Cassidy? Why? What does he want? Is he gonna raid the jail? If we knew that, we'd know what to do. Where's Pat Garrett? You say the whole town is locked in... I asked you, where's Pat Garrett? He's gone. Left a couple of hours ago. Headed west for California. Yeah. That's what he said. He'll never get through. Does that mean you can't take these three out of Abilene to Dodge City? That's just what it means. Oh, the town ain't gonna like that. Town's not gonna like a lot of things, Mr. McAfee, if Cassidy uses it for a target. You think Pat's alive? Depends on his luck. We'll try to find out. Maybe we can pick up his trail. Oh, and Mr. McAfee, you better tell every able-bodied man here in Abilene to have a gun ready. And loaded. You think it's Garrett's? It's Pat's, all right. Look like he broke loose from some place. There's been some riders here. Trail leads up the hill there. We'll follow it. Ah, that's mine. I'll bet, uh... I'll bet 10. Uh, five. Guess it must have been a mountain lion. Let's round up the horses. Butch, Garrett's loose! He's getting away out the back! Well, whoever they are, there's no sense in following them. We couldn't trail them at night. Well, what do we do, Butch? Take a chance on going into Abilene, see what we can find out about Sundance? No. The minute one of our men started asking questions he'd be grabbed. Butch, it was Wyatt Earp and Bat Masterson. Those two working with Garrett? Earp and Masterson, huh? There's something else. Now Garrett knows why we're here. Yeah. What you gonna do? From now on we treat this job just like any other one we've pulled. Go find those idiots who were supposed to be on guard. Come on, Lonnie. Anything I can do for you? Get him out of here. All right, Elzy, just like always. Keep all the regular traffic going in and out of town. If you hear anything about the money, let me know. And fast. Here, wait a minute. Here's what happened to Sundance and the others. Ah. No wonder Garrett wouldn't talk. He's stalling for time. So Earp and Masterson can take those three fools to Dodge for trial. You gonna let them? I don't know. It all depends on whether we get the information we need from that thing. You stay with it and don't miss anything. The council met last night, marshal. The vote was unanimous. We absolutely refuse to ask the men of this town to arm themselves and fight the Cassidy gang. It's ridiculous. We are a peaceful community. Fighting a mob as large as Cassidy's would be like waging war. Now you can tell that to Wyatt Earp and Bat Masterson. You can tell them yourself. I had the pleasure of being a guest of Mr. Cassidy's, Mr. Mayor, a couple of hours ago. They know more about what's going on around here than your law does. What have you been holding out? Holding out? Yeah. You knew about that half a million dollar shipment coming through on that train. You had to know. Anything that big and important must go through your office. Yes, I knew. But it was supposed to be a thorough secret. Even the law enforcement officers between here and Kansas City weren't notified. Why? The cattlemen were afraid that word would get out somehow. Cattlemen? You mean they're driving their herds through here? Within the week. The cattle buyers are shipping their money rather than carrying it on them. They've hired private police to go with the train. Don't those idiots know that robbing trains is Cassidy's specialty? He's never been stopped yet. Maybe we can't stop Cassidy, but we can sure stop that shipment from leaving. You better come with me, Mr. Mayor. We've gonna have to send a wire to Kansas City. That is if the lines are still open. You mean the town is surrounded? Nobody can get in or out? You're locked in unless the wires are still open. Something I can do for you gentlemen? You still getting service through to Kansas City? Sure, why not? Hasn't been any trouble yet. There, you see, we-- We're not locked in. It doesn't seem possible. Cassidy must be up to something else, Pat. Yeah, we better get that wire through and fast, mayor. Now, what will I say? Tell them the Wild Bunch is in the area. To hold up shipment until we notify them that it will be safe. Something's coming in. The way Howard is sending this morning he either busted a finger, he's drunk or he's using his feet. Why? Well, every operator can recognize the other man's style. It's like handwriting. Wait a minute. Suppose that isn't Howard, Pat. Yeah, you're right. Operator, hold up that wire. It won't go through. It has to. How can you be sure? Well, we could send a man out to take a look and get him killed, mayor. I'm as sure as I have to be. We're not going to send that wire. Could Cassidy tap the wires between here and Kansas City? Yeah, there's a relay station a few miles out at the sighting. Why would Cassidy bother? Why didn't he just cut the wires, Pat? You're right, Wyatt. Operator, keep that line open. But I don't see-- Cassidy must need information. And we're gonna give it to him. What? Look, it's not that the shipment is coming through by train tomorrow. But that it is already here in the bank vault at Abilene. Are you out of your mind? Look, you're hemmed in, mayor. Cassidy is spread throughout the hills. We go out there looking for him, none of us will come back. Sure. Get Cassidy out of the hills into Abilene, at least we can see him when we fight him. Deliberately lure that band of thieving, murdering outlaws in here? Cassidy must be stopped. Now, while we have a chance. Unless you've got a better idea. Stop him someplace else. I'm not going to have my town shot up and my people killed. This has stopped being your town when Cassidy took over. Garrett's right. Cassidy's organized big. His gang can operate in three states at the same time. But he's here now. Cassidy himself. Get him out of the way and the whole organization will break up. The law has waited a long time for a chance like this. No, I'm not gonna let you talk me into it. I say take your three prisoners and get out. Go back to Dodge City. Fight Cassidy there if you must fight. You know, Your Honor, I can't make up my mind whether Abilene's scared or you're just plain yellow. Yeah, we're wasting an awful lot of time we don't have. I need some authority, Wyatt. You're deputized. You haven't heard the end of this. Operator, send this message. Money shipment arrived safely. Holding it in the vault of the Abilene bank for the arrival of the buyers. And, uh... Cassidy gang seen. Request additional guards. That ought to do it. Well, we started something, Pat. We better be right. Now you're telling me Pat Garrett left town. Why didn't that maverick come say goodbye to me? Maybe he's afraid you'd try to talk him into staying. Most times I need advice, Lorna. But this time I'd like to give some. Pat Garrett's lived with the badge so long it's like already having a wife. I think I know that. If you wanna be happy, the three of you gotta be happy. You, Pat and the badge. Who's doing the doctoring around here? Pat shouldn't have gone to California. He'd be like a fish out of water. That'll be for me to decide, Buffalo. Pat. You sure found out in a hurry you didn't like California. You're hurt. Where's your dad? He isn't here. Mayor Coleman sent for him. Well, you'd better have a look at his back. Better get your shirt off. You must've met up with the same buffalo I did. All I need is a little sleep. That's all. You'd better check him up. Just in-- Oh, Pat! What happened? You'd find out sooner or later. Ran into Cassidy's gang. Cassidy? Yeah, they've got the whole town surrounded. You can't get in or out. Why? What do they want? Are they after those three gun hawks in the jail? No. But they're coming back into Abilene just the same. Because I asked them to. And the people in this town are gonna help us either put them in jail or kill them. Now, you men head up the group surrounding the town. That's why you're here. What I have in mind is gonna take every gun we have in the area. A wire just came through the relay station. That wire changes our plan. We're not gonna hit the money train. And for a very good reason. The money is already in the bank at Abilene. Either Sundance had his information wrong or the cattlemen shipped the money early. Pat Garrett, Wyatt Earp and Bat Masterson are all in Abilene. If they thought we were gonna hit the bank, they could make it tough for us. But they don't think that. Because we're not supposed to know the money's already in the bank. So they'll still be expecting us to rob the train. Now the way things stand we can pull a surprise raid on the town. With a half a million bucks there, won't the place be loaded with guards? That's right. And that's why that Sundance and Logan and Blackjack Ketchum are gonna help us. Whether they know it or not. Where's Pat? He's still sleeping. I've got to see him. This is important. Is something up? Plenty, Bill. Pat. Pat. Yeah, what is it? There's a big meeting going on over at the El Dorado. Who's there? The mayor called the council together. Could be they'll run us all out of town. Is my father there too? Yes, ma'am. Anybody who has anything to say at all is there. I can't figure this town. Just can't figure it at all. I can. I've told Pat about it before. People here think that Abilene can exist like some peaceful little village in Vermont or Massachusetts. They'd never had to fight for anything and they don't intend to do it now. You don't have to lift a finger to help them. If they feel they don't owe anything to men like you or Wyatt or Bat, let them suffer. Lorna, I've stopped worrying about Abilene. But when a mad dog comes at you, you've got to kill it or be killed. If we let Cassidy get away with it here in Abilene there won't be a town in the whole West that'll be safe. Where's Bat? He's over at the El Dorado getting an earful. I'll wait for you outside. I know these people. They won't listen to you, Pat. Lorna, maybe the-- There'll be one with a conscience. If there is, well, there's always hope for others. Well, that sums it up, men. We have been forced into a position that can only mean trouble and killing for this town. Thanks to Pat Garrett, the biggest and most dangerous collection of outlaws that ever existed is on their way to shoot up Abilene, so they can steal a half a million dollars that is still in Kansas City. Well, what can we do about it? Well, since Pat Garrett had the gall to come here, ask him. What makes you think I'm so happy about facing all those guns? How about you, Wyatt? I can think of places I'd rather be. Bat? I'm ready to quit anytime you are. Well, it's a cinch we can't quit. We can't get the army and we can't get the federal marshals. And we can't get out of here to get the sheriffs of the other towns. It's just us. Us and no one else. You expect the men of this town to give you any help? I expect them to realize that a lot of us had fought hard to hold this country. And I don't think we should give it to Cassidy on a silver platter. All right, Mr. Garrett, you've had your say and I've had mine. Now I'm going to give you the opportunity of asking for volunteers. I think I can save my breath, Mr. Mayor. Go on home. All of you. Well, I guess that settles it. The meeting is adjourned. Pat, I'm truly sorry. Good night, doc. Drink, Bill? Sure. Right. They're all talking outside. I heard what happened. Coleman, you wouldn't dare do a thing like that. Why not, doctor? We don't want Cassidy here, we've settled that. Why not do everything possible to keep him out? Aren't you going to stop him? Maybe he's right. I don't know. What about the rest of you? McAfee, get the horses belonging to these men. Their horses? What for? We're turning them loose. What were you men talking about at that meeting? Safety for this town. I'll assume full responsibility. What in blue blazes good will that do? These men are killers-- And we're making a deal. And I'm sure our friends will accept it. Now you get the horses, marshal. Those are my orders. I'm gonna give you men a chance to save your necks. You won't get any argument from us. As you very well know, Butch Cassidy has this town surrounded. Before morning there's every probability that he will try to raid the bank. The bank? There's nothing there but chicken feed. Pat Garrett has managed to make Cassidy believe there's a half million dollar shipment in the bank vault. What kind of a stupid stunt-- He's pulling Cassidy into town where he can be ambushed. Precisely. How do we know the money isn't there? This notice from the express company describing the shipment and when it's to leave Kansas City. It checks. I'll tell you this much. That train will be the most heavily guarded one in the history of the railroad. If Cassidy's fool enough to attack it and get himself killed, that's his business. When your horses come you're free to go tell him. You're all right, mayor. You should be working for us. I don't think there's a chance in the world of you getting that money. More likely you'll all get yourselves killed. Which should serve as well as hanging you. Are you sure that's the way you really feel, Coleman? Or did you lose your backbone thinking about Cassidy coming into Abilene? Well, do you want the deal or don't you? Do we get our guns back, mayor? You'll get your horses. That's all. Oh, Pat, my father's just told me what's happening. What? There won't be a fight. Cassidy isn't coming here. What are you talking about? Mayor Coleman is releasing the three men from the jail. He's setting them free so they can tell Cassidy the money isn't here. When? Now, he's doing it right now. All right. Horses are outside. The keys, please. Well, I didn't think you'd go through with it, mayor. When a man's scared enough I guess he'll do anything. Now that'll be enough. Well, sure. All right, up against the wall, all of you! Uh, what are you gonna do? Why, we couldn't possibly leave town without our guns. Now where are the guns, marshal? Wait a minute. I said, "Where are they?" Bottom drawer. Get them. All right, now that makes us even. Just tell Pat Garrett I'll see him around. Much obliged, mayor. You're the one that's gonna have to go to jail for this. I don't think so, marshal. The precedent has already been set. The governor of Wyoming granted Cassidy an amnesty to stay out of the state. I only wanted him to stay out of a town. All right, let's crawl down off those horses. Are you kidding, Garrett? We were just turned loose. Yeah, and you're just going back in. What's the matter with you? Mayor promised a safe conduct out of town. Are you getting off those horses or do we have to knock you off? Stand up! Stand up! Stand up! That blasted Pardee is a horse doctor. Tried to draw and I couldn't. Ribs sticking me in all the wrong places. You got clipped on the forehead. Well, what do you know? I've had worse than that in a barber shop. Hope you're satisfied, Jeb. Oh, I didn't wanna give them their guns, did I? Why blame me? We can blame you for getting the idea. We can blame ourselves for following you like a bunch of sheep. Now see here-- Shut up, Coleman. Once and for all, keep you big mouth shut. Pat! You better look after Bill. Well, we stopped the messenger, boys. All we gotta do now is take care of Cassidy. Right back where we started before the mayor got his bright idea. Not quite. We were wrong and we wanna say so. You fellows doing what you did after the way we acted kind of made us see things straight. Even though we did it backwards we were no better than a lynch mob taking the law in our own hands. Yeah, and that's the way we feel about it too. Regardless of what you think of us, that isn't the kind of a town that we set out to have. And it's not going to be that way. We'll get you every man in town that can use a gun. And that goes for everybody else in this town. You know something? I'm beginning to feel like a human being again. Yeah. Think he'll live? Yeah, if he doesn't kill me. Lorna here tells me that it was you that tipped her off about Coleman letting those three out. Why didn't you come right to us? I wasn't gonna say anything, Pat. I was gonna let them get away with it. Somehow it was just a nightmare, it wasn't real. Then I saw the marshal going to livery stable to get those horses. And then it became very real. A man can have just so much on his conscience. That's when I told Lorna. Well, we gonna sit here all night, doc? Perhaps not. But it might be easier than trying to keep you in a hospital bed. What about Cassidy? When do you think he might hit us? Daylight maybe. He'll wanna make sure he can see what he's doing. You hear that, doc? You can keep me in bed till daylight. You come along. Well, now all we gotta do is sweat it out. Yeah, and if Cassidy wants to bust those three out now he can have them. I think we better get things moving. Don't mess with this. You'll only get one chance. Don't worry. All the men posted at all the roads? They'll see that nobody gets in or out of town. All right, mount up. Hyah! He's coming back. I don't know much about this type of thing, Pat, but I have to help. All right, doctor. Everything all set in here? Yeah, how's it outside? Ah, I think the whole town is ready. Rest is up to Cassidy. Bat, marshal, Wyatt, we'd better get in position. What time is it? Must be about 6. Cassidy don't come soon, this waiting's gonna kill me. As soon as you get in, throw the dynamite. That'll pull the lawmen to the other end of the town away from the bank. Right. And when we hear it go off, we'll come in. Now get started. They're coming. Get down! That's it. Hyah! Hyah! Roy. Here they come. Sure wish they were buffalo. Can't make a rug out of an outlaw. Throw down your guns, Cassidy. Cassidy, you and your men are through. Hyah! Hyah. Any more questions, Cassidy? Now I've got all the answers. Doc. Yeah? They say where they're going on their honeymoon? No, Bill, they didn't. Not even to you, huh? All I could get out of Lorna was the strangest remark. She said the three of them are gonna be very happy. That's right. Lorna, Pat... and the badge.
