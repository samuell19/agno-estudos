How uncle Kadokura opened the door when he left Sendai? Yes, it was six years ago. Pow… he did it like a child playing hide-and-seek. I'm very curious to see Kadokura's face… When he suddenly sees us this time. All you talk about is Kadokura. Is it really such a big event to meet him? Most of all, I love mum and uncle Kadokura. Really? Uncle Kadokura is like a beautiful flower. And I'm like an ordinary leaf? You're just my dad. But uncle Kadokura is someone special. He's tall, handsome and very rich. Right, mum? Dad is also very nice. I was the one your mum fell in love with. Splendid. Splendid. Here I am. This way… Dad, look! He has a sign on the door, like a nobleman. The house isn't exactly grand. We finally found the place. There can be no mistake. It's there! Let's surprise him. Kadokura! Kadokura! Uncle! Not home. So beautiful! Great pillows. - Hey Tami… - What? Come look at this fish. Everything is top class, as always. Even his calligraphy is better than mine. But where is he? - I'll check upstairs? - Yes. Uncle… Kadokura You should stop restraining yourself. What? You want to go, don't you? Where? To the Mizutas. You've made up your mind, haven't you? No. Mizuta has already arrived. Together with his women. Probably. The house costs… 30 per day isn't it? Yes. I had to pay 5 yen extra. You wore this only once in 3 years, when you took them around Tokyo. And also when you go to Sendai and Takamatsu. You seemed so enthusiastic looking for a house to rent and taking futons there. I don't have any work left to do today. Work has been secondary for you this month. Mizuta last came to Tokyo 3 years ago, didn't he? I've been nothing but a hindrance for you during these 3 years. You enjoy yourself only with Mizuta. A whole 3 years. 3 and a half. Well. I don't mind. Go join them. No way. Refers to a pioneering flight, Tokyo to London, in a Mitsubishi type 97 ki-15 monoplane christened Kamikaze-go I forgot to buy a radio. Dad, this eel smells so good. Whatever Kadokura makes… Will be tasty for you. Dad, stop it. It was so nice of uncle Kadokura. Looks like your Kadokura isn't coming. He'll come. But he's not here. Is uncle really not coming? I think he will. I'm sure he will. Here he is. Kadokura! Uncle! We got tired of waiting. I forgot to get a radio. Well, come on in! Satoko! You've become a real beauty! You're ready to get married. It's still too early for her. You're just in time. Come in. Your uncle will miss you when you get married. - Uncle… your hat. - Thank you. - Kadokura. - What? - You arranged everything so well. - It's nothing. Stop these formalities. Our relationship is beyond that. Come in. Watch your head. Uncle, can I take the radio out? Of course. Dad, it's the latest model! Put this radio somewhere, at last. You're not a Porter, after all. They've made all kinds of things for you here. Dad, stop it. - Mum, look! - Wow, thank you. - Tami… - I'll get the saké. Even for a rich man like you… It's very chic. Do you like it? I have no one to leave my riches to, right? How's your wife doing? Embroidering, as usual. - French embroidery? - Yes. Some eel? No, thank you. Satoko and I will take a half each. Take everything… really. There's enough for everyone. The best for the guest. Thank you. Well… Together with uncle Kadokura, we have a family of four. To your promotion! You can hardly call it a promotion… Of course, it is. My congratulations. We should thank you. And I'm happy to see you again, Kadokura. Let's drink to it then. I'm always happy to see you. Satoko, help yourself. - Bon Appétit. - Thank you. Kadokura hardware Hello! Returned goods again. Hello! Hello! Head accountant! I'm here. All I managed to get was this. Is it enough for one month? We're saved! I'll make the payment immediately please do. Hello… East Asia Pharmaceuticals, Mr. Mizuta, please. Hello. It's me. How about tonight… in Kagurazaka? Alright. 6 o'clock. - Accepting congratulations on your promotion? - Yes. I saw a metal Bento box, and the next moment… I got a call from a hardware company during wartime, such companies prosper. If our troops advance to the south, we can open a branch on Java. Looks likely. Ah… there she is. Good evening. Your majesty it's her. I'm sorry for being late. Rich men like you need swords and golden beards to complete the image. You're too kind. Who is this man? - This is baron Mizuta. - Baron? Yes. Pour him some saké. My name is Mari-Yakko. It's nice to talk to ordinary people sometimes. It's an honor for me to serve you. Forgive me for the informality, your majesty. You are forgiven. I have an idea. You always serve others. Why don't you sit at the head of the table for once? Forgive me for this prank. No need to apologize. And it's not really a prank, your majesty. But I have responsibilities to people. It's alright. This is love. I suddenly fell in love. I fell in love with the baron. Why are you holding her hand? What's wrong about that? It's the most beautiful woman in Kagurazaka. Thank her. Thank you. We're very grateful. Soamll. You're too kind… anyway… It's so stuffy… Tokyo is so hot. And Shikoku is always so chilly and windy. Kadokura, look! There are carp in here! There are no carp there. Come here. Have a drink with us. Thank you. How did you become friends? Can you guess? I don't think you met at university or at work… Maybe you come from the same city? No, we shared a bed. What do you mean? We were in the army together. Do you know this song, 'the land of many hundred ri…"? So you're army buddies. So that's where you shared a bed. Yes. So had anything happened, we would have died together. How wonderful. Real male friendship. Let me pour you a drink, gentlemen who shared a bed. Much obliged. This saké is good, even though it's from Tokyo. Really? Drink it already. What isn't? You get both Tami and Mari-Yakko. You also have a wife, your Kimiko. Yes. But there's a big difference between my Kimiko and your Tami. My Kimiko is only good to keep at home. You must be joking. Some more saké? Yes, please. And for the baron? Yes. I'm sorry for that. This is good, eh? Is my Tami that pretty? She is. And you still haven't had a good thrashing? No. Not once? Not once. Hello! Good afternoon. - Is that Satoko playing? - Yes. I've come about Yoshihiko Ishikawa. Who? They suit each other so well. Yoshihiko Ishikawa… Belongs to an old family from Sendai. His father is the head of a bank. Next year, he will graduate from the imperial university. Lately he got very interested in the theatre, and his parents are threatening to disinherit him. But young people get such interests like children get measles. Besides, I like people with passion like that. When his parents found out… They said if he got married, he'd return to a normal life. They would be very happy. I strongly recommend him. My husband only finished evening school. Besides, Satoko is only 18. Ma'am… Now she's 18, but soon she'll turn 19. And after that, she'll be 20 in no time. And before you know it, she'll be 21. I gave birth to Satoko when I was 24. You probably don't like receiving this offer from me. It's not that. But you must be so busy. On the contrary I'm free all the time. And it's unbearable. This conversation about marriage makes me so happy. But since you didn't say no… Can I, at least, feel happy how? I'm very grateful. Kadokura spends all the time with you, and I'm all alone. Please, can they meet just once? Only once, and I won't interfere anymore. This way Yoshihiko. Have a seat. Satoko, have a seat nearby. Darling, you can sit there. Satoko plays the violin. Yoshihiko likes the theatre. Two artists will get on, no doubt. Yes. What did you say? Does Satoko play the violin? Who on earth thought of stretching sheep guts… And then rubbing them with a horse tail? It's ridiculous. Dad! What? So how many strings does the violin have? I don't really know… That is… I don't play… Stupid woman, no one's asking you. There are four. The shamisen has 3 strings, no? The koto has 13. But abroad 13 is considered an unlucky number. Darling… Talk only about lucky things, please. During an earthquake, my mum… Do you think an earthquake is a lucky event? That's exactly why in such moments… Mum kept repeating 'tsurukame, 'crane and turtle'. Yes, it does bring luck. Maybe, we should listen to the story without interrupting? Mizuta! Take this. Ever since I was a child… I've… Been around my father and uncle Kadokura. I remember… Father always made a sour face or grumbled. But uncle Kadokura told funny stories and laughed. If mum or I made a mistake, he wouldn't say a word. Mum was always afraid dad would get upset and start grumbling. But being around uncle Kadokura was always nice and easy… - They're like two lions. - What? Here they are. Dad and uncle Kadokura? Aren't they similar? Yes. Mr. lion a. Mr. lion un. I think we should give up this idea of an engagement. It's a pointless waste of money. If this is going to end in a wedding, you can count on me as well. No. No? No. Why not? There's been an embezzlement. A lot of money. How much? Five thousand yen. That's a lot. Yes. Did you embezzled the money? I had nothing to do with it. Had I embezzled the funds, I'd have become a respectable man. It probably was… Assistant director Takamatsu. But I'll be the one to suffer the consequences. I'm junior. So if it comes to light… I'll be the scapegoat. But in that case, you'll get a golden handshake. There are rumors about transferring me to the Java branch. Why there? Why over there? The company is expanding to the south. A new branch just opened there. I'm deep in debt. Good evening. Hello. Ah, Mr. Kadokura… welcome. - Thank you for today. - It's nothing. - Come in. - Thank you. Satoko! - Welcome. - Hello, Satoko. Thank you so much for today. Do come in. I hope you enjoyed yourself. Make yourself at home. Satoko was a real beauty today - I'm here. - Coming. Insects keep flying into the lights. Whatever we do, we can't solve the problem. Whatever we do, fire-flies come and fire-flies die. I'll play with the lamps today. Your turn, Kadokura. Mizuta, take this. What's that for? Just take it. I know I can always ask you for money, but I didn't. Take it anyway. It's disrespectful. What's disrespectful about it? What is it? Am I completely useless? How are you doing here? Your turn. Is it? No, it's your turn. You sure? So what… did Satoko say? It seems, she didn't like him. So it's alright then? Having an imperial university graduate as a son-in-law is terrible. Kadokura, we're grateful. It's nothing. We're sorry but… father feels… Only that… Satoko is still too young. Satoko Ishikawa - Tami! - What? Come here for a minute. What is it? Oh… sit down. What's this? Kadokura gave it to me. Kadokura? He came today precisely to give it to me. Five thousand yen. Remember, I told you about assistant director Takamatsu and an embezzlement? Yes. Now I'm saved. It's incredible. He's a wonderful person. He didn't have to give me the money. But he didn't want to see you cry. You're selling my favorite things. Well, never mind. There's a visitor… At the front door. I'm coming. - Let's look upstairs. - Alright. Are you alright? Welcome! Good afternoon. Darling, the Mizutas are here. Welcome! I'm a bit busy right now… But do come in. Come in. My husband has a visitor. It's not for long, he just needs to get money. It's nice when there's no money. Now my husband eats at home every three days. We hadn't had dinner together for a while. Excuse us… You don't want the engagement? We came to apologize. I wanted to act as an intermediary… Because I thought they suited each other, but I was mistaken. Help yourselves. I should have realized… That I don't belong to your circle. But I'm used to being alone. About Mr. Ishikawa… What should I tell him? I can't tell him you don't like university graduates. The tea's ready. Have some. Satoko… Satoko, what is it? Darling! Darling! Satoko! Darling! Satoko Mizuta? We're here. Let's get an X-ray yes. Mum and dad can stay here. But… Parents wait here. Alright. Satoko… It'll be okay. There's nothing to worry about. - I promise. - Alright. She thought we were husband and wife. Who was? You and I. Is it the first time? I guess so. You and I alone. What? No, I mean… Satoko in hospital for the first time? Yes. Darling! How is Satoko? Looks like she has pneumonia. - Pneumonia? - Everything will be alright. She's getting an X-ray now to know for sure. But it'll be okay. The doctor said she just needs to get some rest. I see. The doctor is Kadokura's friend. We should be grateful to him. It's nothing. This Christian hospital is so grand. There are 10 times as many doctors as in the city hospital. City doctors are no good. She's not a nobleman's daughter, those doctors will do. You're wrong. It's just a hospital. It's better to get treatment in a good place. Still… Funerals… weddings… Don't mention funerals, it's a bad sign! Darling, quiet! What are you doing? I feel itchy itchy? Stupid woman, it's also a bad sign! That's the way people are. A long time ago, after my mother died… Whenever I felt tightness in the chest, I thought I was dying. The same with feeling hungry or sleepy… Stop talking about death! I often had lung problems when I was younger. So she's not alone. I've brought some loquats for Satoko. Kadokura's wife told me. Tell Satoko to take care. Paul Verlaine 'Romances sans Paroles' Good afternoon. It's me. Hello. You're soaking wet. Yes, it's a terrible storm. I can do it myself. How is Satoko? A little better. I'm glad to hear that. I was in the neighborhood and decided to buy a little gift. Thank you. Mr. Kadokura, come in and dry your clothes. And where is Mizuta? He'll be back late today. I see. Then I should probably go. Please, stay since Mizuta isn't at home… Why this timidness all of a sudden? What have I done! I'm so sorry! Mr. Kadokura! Thank you so much. For what? For the 5 thousand. Oh that… it's nothing. - I'm very grateful. - That's between Mizuta and I. Mr. Kadokura. Your company's having a difficult time, and you're giving us money. But… you really shouldn't have. Even if you didn't… We'd still be friends. You're an important man. You deal in army supplies. My husband is an ordinary employee. But we're surviving. I'm sorry. I'll keep it in mind. Have a drink. Ma'am… My company may go bankrupt. Army supplies or something else… The head of a company or an ordinary man, it doesn't matter. No matter how hard I try to increase my riches… If the company goes bankrupt, I'll lose everything. Will we remain friends then? So Mizuta isn't going to Java? No. Thanks to you. We just moved to Tokyo, and moving again… I wouldn't let Mizuta go to Java. That's good. In a faraway place… Without you, it would be lonely. But your company… Whatever Kadakura you become… You must fight for it. To you! 'It's raining in my heart… 'As it's raining outside…' This is love. But Kadokura hasn't even touched my mother's hand. I'm sure there has never been any touching or talking about love. And I think father knows. But though he knows, they've been friends with uncle Kadokura for over 20 years. Both my father and uncle Kadokura have a lot of respect for mother. It makes me proud. And yet, maybe it's love? I think it is. Platonic love. Platonic love? This term was used by the poet Tokoku Kitamura. It means 'passionate love, free of bodily lust'. Passionate love. Yes, probably that's what it is. But… If the expression of love is prevented what happens? It will end in double suicide. It's becoming popular… To commit suicide on mounts Mihara and Sakada on Izu Aceshima. Although the idea of engagement was abandoned… I'm glad we met. How old are you? I'm 18. Having a date? How immoral! Get up! She's a decent grown-up person. Do your parents know about this? Parents have nothing to do with it. Love and marriage concern only two people. What's that?! Do you know what personal freedom is? You liberal bastard! This is violence! The military have no right to interfere in private life. You scum! How about going to the war… And fight in China? I'll show you! Let him go! Stop it! Let's go to another bar? No, that's enough. Didn't you enjoy it? Yes, it was wonderful. Should I give you a lift then? No, thank you. We're so grateful to you. Baron Mizuta! Will you help me, baron? Why only a hand? Offer your back, baron! You're flirting with me. That's it. You can put her down now. That's better Mizuta, congratulations! She's a real beauty! It's not what you think. We understand. Thank you for today you, a ladies man! Goodbye. And I'm sorry. See you tomorrow. So, "it's not what they think," is it? Please, they are my clients. You have to understand. I understood everything the first time I saw you. But it can't much fun being in such company. Na… it's no big deal. So… what now? What? I don't mind. Don't mind? To miss work. If it's permissible… I'm so glad… baron. Move it! Get it delivered and get right back! Put it there. It's alright. I don't need help thanks. Something happen? Nothing. I just popped in for a minute. It's a nice day. I see. Have a seat. Business going well, I see. We're pulling through. What? - Pulling through? - Ya. - Is the company in danger? - Yes. Even so, you give me 5 thou? We'll manage. I was on the verge of bankruptcy… But Tami gave me hope. Tami? Does Tami know about this? Yes. I see… Tami supported you? Yes, she did. - So it was she who saved you. - Yes. It's good. Yes, it is. So what is it? What? You're here on business, aren't you? Not really. Is that situation with Java over now? It's not even worth remembering. Don't be silly. Say… let's go to the barber's, like the old days? All done. I feel like I'm brand new… Isn't it wonderful? I feel like I'm brand new… Isn't it wonderful? Well… you really are getting better. You have talent, baron. I'll be famous… All the way to Jakarta. Will you go to Java with me? To Java? One place is as good as another to die. I'm tired of living in Japan. If Kadokura's lot was poverty… What would he do? A handsome man got the role of a beggar, and it suits him. But then… I'm not a handsome man… I'm a Jester. Hold on, baron! 1234… 5678. Inhale… Be so kind… Today is going to be hot. Oh look how… over Tokyo bay… The sun is shining… He's a man, after all. Mizuta's an unusual kind of man. Don't you know that? Yah. You got jam on your face. Sorry you must be tired. Not at all. What was it… You wanted to discuss? He's been coming home late… For some time now. Mizuta? Yes. Every day. So I decided to talk to you. I found a cheque… an advance on next month's salary in his pocket. Nothing like this ever happened before. I think something needs to be done. Here… Ma'am… It'll be alright. I'll take care of it. Thanks. I'm home! I feel like I'm brand new… Isn't it wonderful? Hello. Were you with clients? I was with Kadokura. He didn't want to let me go. Too many corporate parties lately. Bastards got me bound hand and foot. My health isn't as strong as his, so I became tipsy… Kadokura? Welcome. 'Heaven's net is wide, and its mesh is fine"… As Lao-tzu put it so well. Yes, well said. Satoko, go to bed. Platonic love It just won't do! You gave Kadokura cold tea! Don't you know how it should be done? She thought you'd be here to drink with me. It has nothing to do with that. One has to adjust to the situation. I don't have to apologize… I'm a man. I don't have to explain… Who invited me where on business. I don't have to say where I go without my wife. Coming in I said the first thing that came to mind… my old friend's name. It could have been anyone. You also use my name like that, don't you? Always. You see? We're all connected. In fact, I was there with you in a way… Mari-Yakko from Kagurazaka is your friend. That's where I was. Please, pay for the service… For Myaken Bodhisattva's saké… - Mizu…! - What is it?! It's just a rag. Don't you understand? What? She put a lot of effort into it. Says the man who makes my wife cry. Kadokura is a good man. He's patient… and he's restrained. And you… Forgive me, please. Kadokura… What are you apologizing for? I introduced him to the place. Is it true? Could you really have done that? Satoko's marriage… her father behaving like this could cause problems. Stop talking nonsense! Mr. Kadokura… You also caused me pain. Wasn't it wrong of you? There's nothing I can say. Good night. Goodbye. Hello… east Asia pharmaceuticals? Can I talk to Sekichi Mizuta? What…? Hasn't returned from lunch? Welcome. To tell the truth… miss Mari-Yakko wasn't expecting you. Don't you know? She has to repay her debt. While you're waiting, shall I bring a bottle of saké. Darling! Darling! Satoko… What about her? She left a note. What? Left a note! A note? - I found this in her room… - What is it? Ishikawa Yoshihiko + Satoko = escape Tokoku Kitamura = shuzenji = arai - ungrateful girl! - Darling! Tokoku Kitamura… Is that writer who committed suicide. Stop talking nonsense! Let's check Satoko's room. Alright. Upstairs, quick! The European dresses are here. All the kimonos are here. The bag is also here. She didn't take anything. "Escape… shuzeniji…" "Arai…" Maybe, it's some hotel? Let's call the police! Do you want it in the papers? You'll ruin her life. Maybe, she hasn't decided to run away yet. Hey… Tami! What? Who? Miss Satoko? Hello…? No, she's not here. What happened? Hello?..Hello? She's not at Kadokura's place. She wasn't at the violin classes either. Let me try! Suicide? Double? Nonsense! Calm down. In the morning? Where's the Arai hotel? You are in it. Have you had any visitors today? Of course. We have no vacancies at the moment. Have you had a young couple… From Tokyo? Why? No, nothing. You have everything to relax and unwind here. Let me show you around. Right. Make yourselves at home. It'll be alright. We arrived in time. But while we were on our way… How do we find them now? They're not going to kill themselves the day they arrive in the hotel. Why do you say that? They'll want to make love first. But she wrote 'platonic love'. You and I, we were also only 19. Look at those fish! Darling! It's alright. What are you going to do? We're parents after all. Yes. What is it? I should take a bath. Of course. Sir! Sir! Come out, please! Are you going to add hot water? Here! Put on underwear, at least. It's urgent, but it'd still be embarrassing. Underwear? Quick! Hide in the linen room! I saw a man there, and he attacked me with a knife. Who did you see? A visitor… seems to be hiding. Maybe, my daughter is there too? God… he pulled me out… What a surprise! So you're the couple I mistook for fugitives? A company owner… Drove all the way from Tokyo. That hotel employee was so scared. He decided that I ran away with a lover. And he thought I was her husband. It's so funny! Yes… So Satoko is alright. Thank you so much, Mr. Kadokura. It's nothing. She just went to the movies in Hibiya. With a man? This time, you made a real fuss. Sorry. But why did she write that she wanted to run away to Shuzenji? I asked her. She said she wrote where she would like to receive an invitation to. Such a relief. Since you're in Shuzeniji… Spend time in the hot Springs. You said you hadn't had a honeymoon. Well… I'll leave you alone. No, do stay! Stay with you? Yes. Please… Have some time to yourselves. It happens once in a lifetime. That's why you have to stay with us. Right, Tami? Yes. Unfinished symphony "my love ended… and so too… Has this song." If I die before my time… Then what? If I die before my time, I'd like… What? I'd like to… Drink saké and pass away… Having fun. If… If there is another life… I'd like to meet both of you again. No, I'd like to meet both of you. That we ended up here by chance is so nice. Stop talking nonsense. Don't ever say such nonsense again. I'm talking nonsense? Exactly. A private detective found evidence. That Mr. Kadokura has a lover? Not everything is known yet, but he does have someone. Who can it be? I don't know, but she's young and beautiful. Look, she lives in this house. Has he become interested in women again? I want to go there and look her in the face. Mizuta, I'd like you to come with me. Ma'am, please wait! Don't aggravate the situation. I know Kadokura very well. If he was unfaithful to you, it's because of his business problems. There's a difficult situation with army supplies all over Japan now. Sit down. The situation is very difficult, you see? Sit down, please. You see, they shared a bed in the army. Yes, they sleep in a hammock in the Navy… So that's how they became such good friends. It's like in that song called, army buddies. There is a land of many hundred ri… Faraway Manchuria… Every time I hear that song… I start to cry. I'm especially moved by the words, "I left my heart there…" You too? I do too! - Mizuta! - What? Will you come with me? I'm going there immediately. But! I have to. If I exhibit indecisiveness… The situation will get out of control. Liars shouldn't feel safe. What… Oh! Ma'am… you forgot this! Yes, thank you… Money for the tram! I have money Mizuta. But I need my own… Here's your purse… Satoko, you look great. Hahaha… Over the alps, the laughter of golden bats is heard. Golden bats fly in the sky and hide in the caves. Mizuta, this way! Golden bats are calling for Masae. This way. Golden bats! So quick. What is it? Excuse me. Darling… Don't say a word! It's better not to say anything. Kadokura knows what to do better than we do. And now, let's go home. What are you doing, making your wife cry… idiot! I've bought sweet potatoes! I think he left. Mari-Yakko! What…? But! Mari! But this is Mari-Yakko! Morikawa! Calm down, everyone! Hold on… calm down… Stop it! Does it hurt? During the war, we fought with all kinds of things… With belts, wooden swords, slippers… But a sweet potato from your lover's hand… It hurts a lot. What were you thinking? If you don't pay enough attention to a woman, she becomes dangerous. Divorce is a disgrace. For any woman… Divorce is a terrible thing. You don't have children. So you can spend time with women, unlike me. But if you spend all the time on your lover, your wife is bound to get upset. If you had a daughter, it could cause her a lot of harm. Besides, maintaining a geisha costs a lot of money. Of course, one who has money can afford it. But for a man… it's unworthy. It's indecent! - Mizuta! - What? You've said a lot… So? You're accusing your friend of cheating on his wife. You should get off your high horse. Am I wrong? I can understand the tears of a woman who was lied to… And I can't just stand by and watch. Is that all? What do you mean? Is that all you wanted to say to me? Who else, if not a friend… Has to think about… The feelings of the legitimate wife? Is that why you go to a geisha? Is that why you stole her from me? Why did you keep going there? You have your own woman waiting for you at home. Don't you understand how stupid that is? How do you think Tami felt? I'm embarrassed. I can't look into Tami's face. What's it to you then? She's my wife, my problem. You spend thousands on Tami and pay off Mari-Yakko's debts. And all that so that Tami… It's easy for you to talk now! But if you see tears in a woman's face… You're ready to pay any money. Look! Look at yourself! You're the one loves women! You're a libertine! I'm a libertine? You spent all the time with Mari-Yakko. Did you want an easy affair? Didn't you understand she was my woman? Or do you think all the women in Kagurazaka are mine? How old are you? You're as irresponsible like a youth. I don't want to see you anymore! Don't ever show up at my place again! Yoshihiko Ishikawa, are you here? Yoshihiko Ishikawa! I'll attack him, so you can run away what's going on? If you get caught, say that we're engaged. Ishikawa! It's the police! Open up! You bastard! Second floor! Quick! Stop it! It will be regarded as resistance! Stop! Yoshihiko! Yoshihiko, run! Run! Yoshihiko! Let him go! Satoko! Satoko! Lie down and get warm… For a little while. Satoko…? Uncle Kadokura… Used all his connections. Your father… smoked so much while we were looking for you. He smoked them all. There wasn't a single cigarette in the house. The commander in chief arrives for the final battle. He intends to thwart Chiang Kai-shek's plans. Our armed forces have begun… How much longer will this war last? Longer than we'd like. The situation in the world is getting more and more complicated. The resistance will be overcome very soon. We hope for a resolution to the conflict by the next report. Isn't there a way to find peace? Kadokura, talk to her. Satoko only listens to you. Kadokura… People fall in love… Even if we know… that it's pointless. Kadokura You caught me by surprise. I was just putting away my husband's summer clothes. The weather is so nice today. This is so embarrassing! You saw everything. There's nothing I can do. Beware… Beware what? Nothing. Mr. Mizuta's wife, isn't it? Come on! Tie on a red kerchief. Hey Kadokura! Drink sweet tea or salty tea… Drink sweet tea… Once again! Once again! Sorry. Unlike him, I only eat. Come on, Mizuta. You can do it. Should I jump like a dog? Why not? It's going to be difficult. The dog hasn't been fed. Come on, wag your tail. Or you can stand on your hind legs and ask for a treat! What are you trying to say? You're just pretending you don't have talent. It's like in the song admire my talent. Kadokura! Alright, let's have the next one. 'Pay for the service'? 'Pay for the service', great. Please… be so kind… I'm sorry what? The saké went to my head. I apologize. Apologize for what? Honestly, I don't know why you're apologizing. I don't have anyone closer than you. It's like in the song, 'miserable me'. You wasted some good saké… That one was on me. You didn't pay for it, did you? Excuse me, could you leave us alone? Kadokura! Saké went to your head… Too much to drink. Look at yourself. In the old days, we could go out and fight. But we're grown-ups now, and I don't know what to do. It's because of saké. Let's forget about it. You can't make me forget everything. You said I'm drunk. That… but I didn't mean it, did 1? It's as if we were trying to find a pretext to quarrel. Didn't we use to be friends? You were the one… Who suggested we meet. You said, "let's forget the past and drink like old army buddies." "My money is your money," you said. Were they just empty words? Mizuta! You've been really tactless lately From now on, I break off relations with you! Hey! Our guest is leaving! Show him out! Welcome. Uncle! Hello. This is… my first coffee ever. Really? That night I lied. I said I stayed with my friend in a café after class. Afterwards… My father slapped me in the face. He said, "we turned him down." "You lied to us and secretly went on a date with him." But, uncle… You don't talk about the most important thing either. Mum, dad and you… You all go on daily without telling the truth. Coffee is a convenient thing to lie about. Uncle, do you love mum? The police are going to release Ishikawa. He's now under the 'watchful eye' of the secret police. Even if you're in love, you have to exercise restraint when you meet. “It's raining in my heart"… "As it's raining outside.” It's so sad. Satoko, life's the same. That's what life is like. Some things you have to sacrifice. That's how it is. Don't be sad! Alright. Satoko… you have to live. There'll be many good things in your life. Well then… Won't come see us any more? You don't shake hands with those you love. Farewell. Our collars are like Sakura petals the wind is scattering flowers all over Yoshino. Yamato's children die honorable deaths, like flowers. A rifle 1 shaku long and a sword 1 sun long can do no harm. But our spirit has been strengthened over two thousand years. On December, 11 the imperial army office… Declared that on December, 10 at 5 pm our army entered Nanking. The Japanese flag was hung on the walls of the castle. On December 9 at 5.30 am Koka gate was captured. The capital fell. Nanking's fallen… hurray! Hurrah! Ouch! I'm sorry watch where you're walking! Are you alright? I'm sorry. Java's the only option. For you? No, for a friend of mine. His name's Mizuta. He's a very good guy. It's a long time… since we met. Likely both will go. Today he was appointed as head… Of the Java branch. I found out about it by accident from a business partner. So he's a successful man? Yes… His wife… is a wonderful woman. Her name's Tami. You in love with her? What? Come on, have a drink. It's for the better. When a feeling grows stronger, it gets hard to conceal. And now it's grown so strong… That it may cause her harm. Am I right? One more. Thank you. Oh, it's hot. And who ended up the winner, you or your friend? What…? Who does she love more? Fifty-fifty. Lucky to be born a man. You think so? You should meet. If you meet, it'll get easier one way or another. No…? Don't you think… It's worth meeting once for that? I'll regret it, you say? Maybe, we should meet. Almost forgot. Oh, it's snowing. Snowing? Everything will be alright. Well, thanks for the treat. Goodbye. Glory to the victory! Hurrah! Glory to the head of the Java branch! Hurray! Give me the bill, please. I think that man… He stole my wallet. - Welcome back. - Welcome. They're sending me to Java. To Java? To Java? As head of the local branch. Are you coming with me? I won't force you. You can stay in Tokyo if you want. I'll… go too. We're a husband and a wife, after all. Dad, I… Why talk in the hallway? Satoko, close the door. Uncle? Uncle Kadokura is here! Don't just stand there! Lock the door, quick. But uncle Kadokura's here. Darling, wait! Come back! Come back, or I'll divorce you! Mr. Kadokura! We're going to Java. It's so far away. I don't know if we'll ever meet again. I don't want to be a burden. And I don't want to turn away from you. I'm so lonely. We've been close friends for 20 years. Is it over? Mizuta! Congratulations on your promotion! It gets hot there. Beware of malaria and miliaria. And you, keep strengthening our army. Earn as much money as you can. Beware of bankruptcy. I will. Satoko… be well. Wait! Come in, let's have a drink together. Have a seat. Uncle, can you find accommodation for me? What for? I'm staying in Tokyo. I forbid it! You're an unmarried woman. You can't live alone. Don't worry uncle and auntie will keep an eye on me. Satoko! It's not happening! I'll bite my tongue off. Stop that nonsense. You must be joking! If you don't let me seriously I'll bite my tongue off. Satoko, stop it! Stop immediately! - So I can stay? - No. An 18-year-old girl can't live alone. No way! Mum, tell dad… = no. Why not? Dad, please! Can I come in? Satoko! There's someone at the door… Can I come in? Please? Yoshihiko! I received my call-up papers. My military service starts in a week. Ishikawa! We wish you good luck. Thank you. Darling, we were going to have a drink. Satoko! Go to him. You don't have to come back tonight. I'll take the responsibility Thank you, uncle. Tami, you too. My legs start itching when I drink. You have to drink today. I married my daughter… In a rumpled skirt… And a patched jumper. Ishikawa will come back alive. If he was drafted while under secret police surveillance, he'll come back alive. That's what people say. For Satoko… This will be the best night of her life. You don't want to go to Java, do you dear? Mr. Kadokura would have nowhere to go.
