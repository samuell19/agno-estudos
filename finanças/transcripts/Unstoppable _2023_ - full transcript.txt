He is the director, he is the producer, he is the music director, he is the singer and he is the hero. If one person plays all the roles... Who will watch the movie then? Watching a movie like this on OTT, the audience is on the verge of going to the hospital. They said something new in the movie storyline. What is the new point? No point. Scientists say that the ozone layer has been damaged, He goes up with a kite and healing the ozone layer. What is your rating for this movie? What is that, dude! Everyone is saying that the movie is a hit. Brother! If the movie is good, will you show us? Only when we say that the movie is a waste, not good... They show us with #tags.
