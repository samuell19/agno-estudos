I'm your handler, Nikolai. I decide when you need to be extracted. They know, Greenglass. - You don't know what they know. - Markov was in room. Just because Markov was there... Markov was standing in room when your man confessed one of us was mole. He didn't say your name... right? He didn't describe your face. Hell, he doesn't know if you're Soviet, Chinese or VC. He couldn't. Cause I've never told anyone who you are, Nikolai. All my men know is that I have a highly reliable and highly confidential source of information. Markov is not stupid man. So? Neither are you! You tell him whatever he needs to hear. You march into his room... tell him you'll find the turncoat. Is no longer possible. You wanna tell me why? I'm arrived in Vientiane. It's a... long way from Hanoi. I need to know I can enter Thailand. Once I am to Bangkok I can do rest. We both know... the checkpoint is under Pathet Lao control, Nikolai. And we both know different men control different route out from Vientiane. And those men need to know I am coming if I am to pass. What makes you think the company controls Vientiane's back door? Will you let them know I am arriving? Where'd you hear we control Vientiane's backdoor? Will you... please... - let them know who I am? - Right now... I need you to go back to Hanoi. - You told me you would get me out. - And I will. But... - not now. - No, not now. - Not ever! - No. Not now. When this war is over. Right now I need you in Hanoi. Nothing you've said indicates you've been burned alright. Go back. Give Markov a great show. Hunt for the mole. Put some poor gook's head on a pike. And when this war ends... I will fly you to the White House and give you a fuckin' parade. But, until this war ends, until this war ends... I'm your handler, Nikolai. And I decide when you need to be extracted. Mr. Howard Simons? I'm here Nikolai. So... I'm not sure what you want me to say. - You heard Mr. Anthony Greenglass. - I heard him turn you down. - I heard him order you back to Hanoi. - You asked for proof... now you have it. You know I am CIA asset, you know I supply Greenglass with information and you know that CIA is still in Laos. Look, Nikolai. I'm just a newsman. I run a newspaper. Sometimes I get to catch bad people doing bad things, but... Most of the time I just make the trains run on time. Washington Post is... powerful paper. Not powerful enough to piss off the CIA. And only powerful man can control such powerful paper. I don't need my ass kissed. I know who I am. And I know what got me here. I deal with the CIA everyday. Anthony Greenglass is a high ranking agency project manager. And while I heard him confirm who you are I also heard him tell you no. Whatever it is you want from me is... more than I can give. I need you to put me on plane. I won't put you on a plane! You have a story to tell? Great, I still don't know what that story is. But no story is worth crossing the CIA. This is different story! Every story is different but in the end every story is the same. Mr. Anthony Greenglass is using weaponized Sarin in Laos... Mr. Howard Simons. His men have killed thousands throughout north east Laos. When wind blows correct direction, enemy is killed. When wind changes direction, entire village is killed instead. And Mr. Anthony Greenglass will continue to use his stockpile of nerve gas... until he is exposed. Mr. Howard Simons? Are you still there? Yeah. So... let me get this straight. You're accusing a CIA manager... and a team of special forces... of committing the worst possible kind of war crimes. Is that it? Do you believe me, Mr. Howard Simons? - Got any proof? - Microfiche. Dates. Names. Locations. Pictures. Everything. - What do you need? - Get me to Bangkok. From Bangkok I will fly to Mexico. You will insist on seeing proof before taking me to America. This is reasonable. You have... many journalist in Mexico? Scott Webb is in Mexico City. 50 kilometers south of Juarez is abandoned prison named Puerta Cobre. Mr. Scott Webb will meet me there. I will give him evidence, he will get me to America. It will take me... a half an hour to arrange the details. Can you stay by this phone? I am comfortable where I am. Okay. I'll get your plane ticket, Nikolai. You'll get to Bangkok, Scott will meet you in Mexico... you'll get the chance to prove whether you're telling the truth or not. If your evidence is convincing we'll help you get across the border. There are so many ways this can go south. If you're another Golytsin my career is over and and you'll be locked up far away in a place that doesn't exist. If what you say is true... and Greenglass finds out we talked we're both dead men. I am KGB agent, Mr. Howard Simons. There is no need to talk to me like common man. Don't leave your room. Don't make any phone calls. Don't order room service. Don't let the maid in to make the bed. When you get to the airport... you wait in a bathroom stall until five minutes before your flight leaves. Don't do anything, anything that lets anyone get anywhere near you. Greenglass is not going to get his hands dirty on this one. He will send someone else. You can count on that. I look forward to your next phone call, Mr. Howard Simons. Yeah... yeah... - Yeah. - This is Harper. Your status report is overdue. I hadta drive to Davison to find another flight. Davison. Must be a goddamn good reason. You know what, from the moment you called I've been makin' this happen. Okay, I missed the flight at Quantico but I caught one at Davison, now I'm here... and I'm on time for the meeting, so, let me do my job Your mess is now my mess, Harper. If the Post confirms Derzhinsky's story we're both going to spend a lot of time in jail, pal. - Did I fuck up by helping you out of Laos? - No! You didn't. I'm here, Greenglass. And I'm on time. Webb's spending the next few days in a Juarez jail cell. And Nikolai Derzhinsky's only one man. - The situation's under control. - No. Not until that shitheel chekisty is dead and the evidence is gone. That's exactly what I'm doin'. Your next status report is 1400. This better be done by then. Stop there. Stop there. Turn around. Please to walk to guard station. Take out gun and place in front of camera. Take out gun and place in front of camera. Stop talking now. There is only sound maker, no sound receiver. I cannot hear you and I cannot read mouth. Do you understand? You put gun in front of camera. After, I tell you where to arrive to me. Do not leave. Put gun in front of camera. Do not make situation complex. Come... come back now! Do not... My terms are reasonable terms, you do not need gun for me. Okay, okay, okay, you keep gun. You keep gun. Show me identification and I tell you where to arrive. You walk towards tall arches. Walk through red doors. You will be in lobby. Wait there for my next instruction. Walk through east door. You will be in long hallway shaped like letter L. Walk until you reach end of hall. Walk left and go through gate. You are in central corridor. Go east five minutes. If you go wrong direction you will be lost. This is a very big place. This is very dangerous place. Follow my directions carefully, if you please, or will take much time for finding you. Walk down stairway. Enter door on left. Turn right. Walk straight until I find you. Please, to stop there. You mind turnin' that thing off? Cameras, speakers... a lot of work for a simple meeting. Equipment has been here long time. You know alotta 'bout this place. My... country used as listening post for many year. Listening post? For what... White Sands? There is much of interest to my country in New Mexico. So, you were stationed here. How long? We can small talk on way to El Paso. - Place gun on ground. - We're back to that, huh? Place gun on ground now. Threatening me isn't going to get me to hand you my weapon. Please repeat. I do not understand. I'd be fucking nuts to hand over my weapon after you just raised yours. We can... both place our guns on ground... together. I'm not spending an hour cleaning my weapon because you're paranoid. I asked much politely. Congratulations. The answer's still no. You done sizin' me up? - I... I do not understand. - Let's make this simple. Okay, you show me the evidence. I'll look at the evidence. If the evidence is real, then I escort you into America. The evidence is here. You plannin' on showin' it to me? - Let me see your identification. - You already saw my ID. I would like to see your identification again. Fine! Here's my goddamn ID. Is not necessary to curse. Just fucking check it! I don't know when Americans began cursing much casually, but... is not normal way to speak. No other culture curses like America. English is such big language. So many words. French words, Spanish words, German words, Latin words. And yet, Americans can only say "fuck you" and "Goddamn me." If you knew any Americans, you'd know none of us say "Goddamn me." But... But, you understand my meaning. We speak like this when we're stressed out. - What is "stressed out"? - Under distress. I am under distress as well. I do not need or curse God and speak of intimate acts for lovers. You wanna look at my ID? I am examining your identification. What is origin of Webb? Excuse me? What is origin of your family name? I don't know. We're American. We don't give a shit where are names come from. But you know the origin of your family, yeah? What I'd like to know when I can see the evidence. I will tell you what I know. I know you are not KGB. When KGB learns English, he does not learn how to curse American style. I know you are not Mossad because Israeli does not defame God. You are not MI6 because British would know that Webb... is English name. It means Weaver... did you know this? Do you want me to take you to America, Nikolai? I'm gonna need to see the evidence. What concerns me is how you speak of your gun. You said weapon. I gave you opportunity to say different word... again, you said... weapon. Military says word weapon. CIA says word... weapon. Journalist would most likely say word... gun. You refused to throw your gun onto the floor. Because you value your weapon. That's right. You threw your identification onto floor without hesitation. - If I wanted to harm you, Nikolai... - You would wait for me to give you evidence. My name is Scott Webb. This is what your identification says. We can walk out to my car right now and call my boss. That is most considerate of you. I would also like to be considerate. This is CIA issued SSB transceiver. Self-scrambling with modified handset, is state-of-art. If weather permits, we can call half of world. So... we do not need to use your car phone. We can call Mr. Howard Simons now. If you reach for your weapon, I will shoot you. What's this? Is passport. No shit! Is there more? Is there more? And there is nothing I can say you can trust. There is nothing I can say to save my life. Yeah, I guess that's true. You think you are clever man. Fake names, fake documents and mouth full of lies. This does not make you clever. This make you coward. You are sneaky coward who does not want his secrets to be known. "Mr. Scott Webb" unfortunate for you... evidence is not enough. I know your secrets. And, I cannot let you leave with what is inside my passport. Is necessary for both of us, yes? Goddamn crazy Cossack. Fortunate for me... you are coward with no more tricks. I know you are enemy. And I will enjoy hunting you. For me, choice is simple. For you... which do you fear more? To be exposed or to be killed? If you shoot me first... you won't have to make choice, will you? - Damn right! - You are fortunate man. If blade cut artery, tie would be of no use. You are good with gun... is shame there are many camera. I got plenty of bullets. It does not matter now. I know where you are. And you... are almost out of bullets. I have other gun as well. We talk now. Subtitles: zefram cochrane
