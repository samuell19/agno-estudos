I'M WAITING FOR SOME REPORTS FROM OKLAHOMA AND TEXAS. NOBODY SEEMS TO KNOW WHAT'S CAUSING IT. MY WIFE'S BEEN READING ARTICLES ABOUT THIS STUFF, AND SHE'S OF THE OPINION THAT IT'S DEVIL CULTISTS. BUT, FRED, THERE'S REALLY NO EVIDENCE. THIS HAPPENS AT NIGHT. WHY DON'T WE SEND PATROLS? THE GUN CLUB -- HELL, WE'LL ORGANIZE SOMETHING, GO AFTER THESE CULTS. I DON'T WANT TO HEAR ANY TALK ABOUT GUN CLUBS OR NIGHT PATROLS. I AM THE LAW HERE. LOOK, EVEN IF IT IS SOME KIND OF CULT, THEY'RE STILL PEOPLE, RIGHT? THEY HAVE TO DRIVE THERE OR WALK. THEY HAVE TO LEAVE SOME KIND OF TRACKS, AND THERE HAVE BEEN NO TRACKS. ALSO, THE LAST CARCASS THAT I SAW, WITHIN 24 HOURS, ALL OF THE VITAL ORGANS HAD DISAPPEARED.

WELL, RIGHT NOW THAT EXISTENCE IS BEING THREATENED BY ANYTHING FROM WHO-KNOWS-WHAT TO UFOs, BUT IT'S NOT PREDATORS. WE LOOK AT THINGS LOGICALLY, NOT EMOTIONALLY. IF YOU BELIEVE IN UFOs, IT'S OKAY WITH ME, BUT IF IT'S UFOs ATTACKING THESE CARCASSES, THAT IS BEYOND THE REALM OF MY DEPARTMENT'S ACTIVITY. I'M -- I'M GOING TO NEED THAT, BUT I'D BE HAPPY TO MAKE YOU A COPY. IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME.

AND THIS PARTICULAR STRAIN HAS BEEN MODIFIED by gene splicing. WHERE DOES IT COME FROM? WELL, I'D NEVER SIGN MY NAME TO THIS -- LIEUTENANT CASTLE DID SAY YOU WOULDN'T QUOTE ME. No, I won't. YES, WELL, THE ONLY PLACE I'VE EVER HEARD OF IT SHOWING UP was in some germ warfare tests that the government was doing back before this was all banned, back in 1969 and 1970. SO, WHAT HAVE YOU GOT GOING ON OUT THERE? LET ME TALK TO STEELE. UNCLE BEN, YEAH. LISTEN, YOU SON OF A BITCH, WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING? YEAH, WELL, I WANT TO SEE YOU RIGHT NOW. NOT TOMORROW, NOW -- TODAY. IS THAT AS SOON AS YOU CAN MAKE IT? ALL RIGHT, YOU GOT IT. [ HANGS UP PHONE ] WHAT'S UP, UNCLE BEN? STEELE, YOU'RE NOT JUST TESTING WEAPONS ON ANIMALS. YOU'RE KILLING PEOPLE. GET OUT OF BANNON COUNTY. YOU AIN'T DEALING WITH THE GODDAMN BUREAUCRACY NOW, FAT BOY. AND YOU'RE NOT IN GUATEMALA TAKING POTSHOTS AT BAREFOOT NATIVES. YOU FAILED TO SILENCE THE MAN, MORGAN. YOU CAUSED HIM TO DIE. I'M A PATRIOT, STEELE. I'D DO ANYTHING FOR MY COUNTRY. HA HA. WE SPENT A LOT OF SHIT ON THIS, MORGAN, WAITING FOR THE RIGHT -- THE RIGHT CONDITIONS. WE'VE DUPLICATED FUCKING MOSCOW HERE. WE'RE THIS CLOSE. DO YOU UNDERSTAND? NOTHING IS GOING TO GET IN OUR WAY -- NOTHING. THEN DON'T LEAVE THE CARCASSES LAYING AROUND. HOW ARE WE GOING TO FINISH OUR TESTS IF WE DON'T? YOU TOLD US THIS WAS YOUR TOWN, YOUR SHERIFF, YOUR NEWSPAPER. I NEVER SAID NEWSPAPER. THE MAYOR, THE TOWN COUNCIL. THERE ARE SEVERAL PEOPLE AROUND HERE THAT ARE STARTING TO LOOK LIKE COWS TO ME. STEELE! YOU GOT FIVE DAYS TO FINISH YOUR TESTS AND GET OUT OF HERE! YOU'RE FORGETTING WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT! Man: GENTLEMEN, I'D JUST RATHER NOT BE RAILROADED. ALL RIGHT, I'VE TAKEN A LOOK AT THIS THING. I'VE BRIEFLY GONE THROUGH IT. MR. CHAIRMAN, WE NEED AN APPROVAL. THE AIR FORCE IS PREPARED RIGHT NOW TO GO. SO IS THE 82nd. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? YOU'D THINK THEY WOULD LEARN SOMETHING FROM VIETNAM. EXCUSE ME, MR. VOSBURGH. YOUR BROTHER'S CALLING FROM COLORADO. HE SAYS IT'S ABOUT YOUR MOTHER AND IT'S URGENT. OH, GOD. YES, THANK YOU, NANCY.

THIS IS KITCHEN TO BLACK BEAUTY. BRING IN THE BEEF. Harry: THE GOVERNMENT KILLED A COUPLE OF THOUSAND SHEEP A FEW YEARS AGO IN UTAH. THEY SAID IT WAS AN ACCIDENT, BUT IT WAS NERVE GAS TESTING. WHY EXPERIMENT ON OUR COWS? I MEAN, WHY NOT DO IT ON GOVERNMENT LAND? WHO WOULD KNOW? WHO? A COUPLE OF HUNDRED GOVERNMENT GUYS PULLING SCUM DUTY ON FEDERAL LAND SOMEWHERE. NO, NO. DOESN'T SOUND LIKE THIS OPERATION. YOU AND I WERE BOTH IN THE ARMY. IT DOESN'T WORK LIKE THAT. THESE GUYS ARE TOO MOBILE. THEY MOVE AROUND TOO QUICKLY UNNOTICED. AND THAT ARMY SURPLUS TYPE IN THE HELICOPTER, HE'S NOT A G.I. THESE GUYS ARE PLAYING UNCLE SAM. IT'S NOT THE GOVERNMENT. NOT THE GOVERNMENT? WHO ELSE WOULD BE DOING GERM WARFARE TESTING? I CAN'T GIVE YOU THEIR PHONE NUMBER, BUT IT'S A CHEAP, EFFECTIVE WAY TO KILL A HELL OF A LOT OF PEOPLE. THIS IS GETTING A LITTLE WILD. THIS IS ALL SPECULATION. IF WHAT'S GOING ON AROUND HERE IS ORGANIZED, YOU DON'T WANT TO GO UP AGAINST IT. THE GOVERNMENT, THE RIGHT WING, THE LEFT WING, MERCENARIES, THE MOB -- IT DOESN'T MAKE MUCH DIFFERENCE IF YOU GET IN THEIR WAY. NO BAD GUYS IN BANNON COUNTY, HUH?

PRICE OF CATTLE WENT UP A FEW CENTS, THE PRICE OF FUEL WENT UP A QUARTER. I THINK ALL THOSE DAMN POLITICIANS ARE BORN WITH 15-WATT SOULS WITH BAMBOO FILAMENTS. DEATH TO THEM. 78, 79, 80 -- OH, GOOD MORNING, MR. MORGAN. EXCUSE ME. Ruben: CHANGE PLANES IN DENVER. AMERICAN FLIGHT 546 TO KENNEDY. AUNT RUTHIE WILL MEET YOU AT THE AIRPORT.

I WAS HIDING IN THE BUSHES. SEE, THAT'S WHAT I DO FOR A LIVING. I HIDE IN THE BUSHES. WHAT'S GOING ON? WHY DID YOU KILL JOE HIATT? [ Slurred ] I'M SICK. I NEED A DOCTOR. I'LL TAKE YOU TO A DOCTOR. I'LL TAKE YOU TO JOE HIATT'S DOCTOR. [ COWS MOOING ] BILLY, IS MR. MORGAN HERE? I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM ALL DAY. HAS ANYBODY ELSE BEEN HERE LOOKING FOR HIM? A GUY IN AN OLD BLUE CADILLAC? NO. DAMN IT. HOW MANY MERCENARIES YOU GOT IN THAT HOLE AND WHAT ARE THEY DOING? I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT? THE RUSSIANS. THE RUSSIANS? YOU KILLED JOE BECAUSE YOU'RE PARANOID OF THE RUSSIANS. YOU POOR SON OF A BITCH. I'M AN AMERICAN! MORGAN! MORGAN! AAH!

HARRY, I'M TRYING TO SAVE YOUR LIFE. YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT! YOU'RE SAYING THE GUYS THAT ARE DOING THESE EXPERIMENTS ARE THE SAME GUYS THAT KILLED JOE HIATT AND BEN MORGAN? YES. IT'S A LITTLE FAR-FETCHED, ISN'T IT, HARRY? HOW DO YOU KNOW? DOC KREBS TOLD ME JOE HIATT DIED OF A DAMNED HEART ATTACK. JOE HIATT WAS MURDERED BECAUSE OF WHAT HE KNEW. HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT? FRED, I SHOWED YOU BEN MORGAN'S BODY. THE MAN EXPLODED. WHAT DO YOU EXPECT OUT OF SOMEBODY THAT WAS THROWN OUT OF A DAMN PICKUP TRUCK? HE WAS POISONED. HARRY, WHERE YOU GETTING ALL THIS HORSESHIT?

I'M NOT HERE FOR THAT. I HAVE A MESSAGE. FROM WHOM? WE HAVE YOUR DAUGHTER. WHAT? SHE WILL NOT BE HARMED IF YOU BACK OFF FOR 24 HOURS. YOUR DAUGHTER WILL BE RELEASED, AND WE'LL BE GONE. NOBODY AROUND HERE WILL HEAR FROM US AGAIN. WAIT A MINUTE! NO DETAILS. YOU DON'T MOVE -- 24 HOURS. YOU UNDERSTAND? I GOT JUST ONE QUESTION. WHY WOULD THEY LEAVE THESE CATTLE LYING AROUND FOR US TO MARVEL AT? MAYBE IT'S PART OF THE TESTS. IN THE ARMY, WE HAD LECTURES. THE THING ABOUT GERM WARFARE IS THAT THEY NEED TO KNOW HOW LONG THESE POISONS LAST. LOOK, I DON'T KNOW. JOE HIATT STARTED ME THINKING THIS WAY. I DOUBTED HIM, AND NOW HE'S DEAD. NOW, IF I'M RIGHT, HOW MANY MORE LIVES ARE IN DANGER? FRED, I WANT YOUR PERMISSION TO DEPUTIZE 200 PEOPLE TO GO OUT THERE AND SURROUND THAT PLACE. AFTER WE SEE WHAT'S INSIDE, WE'LL CALL WASHINGTON.
