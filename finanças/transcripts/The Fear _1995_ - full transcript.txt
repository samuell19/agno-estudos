Goofy, huh? - How frequently are you having this dream, Richard? - Not often. A few times a year, I guess. Look, can we talk about my thesis? I wanna do more than just a dry, academic rehash. - Hold on a second, though. Let's go back to your dream. Play the shrink for me. What does it suggest to you? - Come on. Uh, something buried. Something underground. The subconscious. Like it's, it's just some childhood bogeyman. - Is it? - Come on, don't Freud me out of here, Dr. Arnold. - Don't dismiss Freud. I mean, he might be dated, but he was no dummy. - All right, well, there's no emotionally crippling trauma that springs to mind, if that's what you mean. - Okay, tell me about your thesis. - Okay, all right, it's gonna be a field session. It's gonna be a weekend of fear exploration in a controlled environment. - You gonna explore your own fears, as well? - Psychology's a spectator sport, Dr. Arnold. - You know the quest for wholeness, it's the holy grail of psychology. - Jung, right? - I'll approve your workshop, if you do one additional little assignment. - Oh, boy. All right, what is it? - Take that with you. Find the missing piece. - You're kidding, right? - The people that become shrinks do so because they're in need of therapy themselves. You're aware of that aren't you? - Yeah. - Good, 'cause that's the best reason. - Easy, easy. You shouldn't be out here alone after dark. - Yeah, I know.

That's the truth, Troy. - Look, man, no offense but that there is bullshit, right. I got no phobias. What the- - Hey, no offense, man, but that theory's some bullshit. You know what I'm saying? - Oh, fuck you, man, that was a bee. Shit on it, you wipe it off? Sure enough, baby. - What would you wipe it off with, man? - I can't tell you, babe. - Hello, hello.

Richard, are you coming? Well? Wow. - Yeah. - Put it down. Put it down. Please, put it down. - Cool. What's he got in there? A spare set of balls and shit? - My old room. - Richard, this place is so incredible. We should move up here after we're married. This could be the boys room. Your son, Richard, Robin. How's that for a name? I've always liked it, it sounds so free. - We're not there yet. - You know what? The cradle could go here. We better get a bed, you know they'll be jumping on it before you know it. They grow up so fast. - What's next? A swing set in the yard? - Oh, come on, you know kids. They'll be happy with a cardboard box and a stick. I know I was. Weren't you? - Depends on who's buried in the cardboard box. Look, Ash. Kids can't live on nuts and berries. I gotta finish school. I gotta start my practice. - I'm not complicated, Richard. All I want is life with you. Just us and a little baby. When I think of looking into his eyes and seeing your expression echoed there. Just saying "I love you, Robin." That's all. - You're just moving a little too fast for me, that's all. But you hang in there and I'll get there. Hey, Rich, where we shacking up, man? - Shit.

Ain't he beautiful, Ash? - There's a real presence there. Can't you feel it? - Yeah, right. - Where'd he come from, Richard? - He stood in my grandfather's general store. You know displaying suits and stuff. When the store closed, they brought him here as kind of a guardian, I guess. Gets pretty lonely up here, especially, as a kid. Morty was my best friend. You know, it's so weird. I'd forgotten all about him. I never forgot you, motherfucker. - Troy, man. Psych. - Gerald, let's dust him off and take him downstairs so he can watch over us all. - Can't see it happening, babe. Can't see it happening. I'm outta here. - I agree with him. Let's get something to eat, okay? - Let's put this shit away, man. - I got it, I got it. - That's ugly, man. You ugly, boy. - All right, Morty's gonna be our sacred guardian. He can be trusted with all your secrets, all your fears. He won't tell anybody and, more importantly... he won't judge. Shit. - All right, so who's first? - Oh, Rich, man. Chill out, baby. - Troy, rah, thanks for volunteering, man. Come on down. Oh, shit. - Gotcha. - Aw, man, you ain't serious. You want me to talk to this wooden motherfucker? - Hey man, I talk to your ass. - Damn, Rich. What's up, Morty? All right, you so fucking smart, then you tell me. What am I afraid of? You see? You see what I'm saying? - What's that, Morty? Hey Troy, man, you got a spider on your leg. - Oh, where? Where? This shit ain't cool, Rich. All right, all right. So bugs, they make me uncomfortable. - Uncomfortable? You looked like you shit your pants. - Well, that would make him uncomfortable. - Yeah, but we can thank Gus's goddamn tracking for that, shit. You remember Gus? - All right, Leslie. - Sure, why not. Well, I was a popular girl in high school. Lots of dates. Good times. Would've been prom queen, then he came along. I was yanked right out the best years of my life to raise him. Sometimes I feel like I missed out on the life I should've had. - Boo-hoo, hoo, hoo. - Hey, come on, Troy. Cut the shit. So what scares you, Leslie? - I don't wanna get old. I'm done, okay. - Thanks. Come on, your turn. Come on. Your turn. - Pass. - Oh, come on. Come on, man. Come on, man. It's your turn. - I don't know what you want me to say. Whatever. - Just think about it, man. Everybody's afraid of something, Vance. - Poverty... I guess. - All right. This is bullshit. - Hey, what about your? Sorry. Why is it wrapped? - None of your business. - What about this tattoo? What's that about? - This is bullshit. Thanks. - Hey, uh, hey come on. - Not right now, Richard. - Come on. - I just don't feel comfortable right now. Oh, stop. Oh, what, Ash? - Ah, shit. Look, hey everybody, just hang tight for a little bit. I'll be right back. - What, fuck? - Ashley. What the hell's the matter with you? - Look, Richard, nobody wants to play your game, all right. It's just not working out. - Fine. - Ho-ho-ho, boys and girls. Santa's here. - Oh, shit. Hey, hey, hey, Richard. - Hey, Uncle Pete, how you doing? How are you? - Well, introduce me. - All right, Ashley, this is my Uncle Pete. You could never tell by looking at it but he runs the Christmas Village up here. - Oh, that place we passed on the way up. - You got it. And this is Tanya Larson. She's the pink in Santa's cheeks. - Hi, Richard. Hey, how are you doing? - Uncle Pete has told me so much about you. - So this is great. What brings you up here? - Well, the snow, it slammed dunked my house and I got a couple of guys repairing it. So we can't stay there. - Oh, no-no-no-no-no. Look, I told you already we're having a workshop here this weekend. - Rich, lighten up. I mean, we'll make ourselves real tiny. It's just for the weekend. Won't we, sugar? - Uncle Pete, I told you this is a controlled environment. If you're not participating in the session. - Richard. Come on. It's so nice to finally meet some of Richard's family. - Yeah, well what's left of it. All right, fine. But look, don't come complaining to me if you get bored. There's nothing to do up here. The lake's like 20 degrees. - That suits me fine. - You know she's got this thing with water, you know? - Some kids pushed me into the pool when I was little. - Ah, a little phobia, huh? Another victim for the evil Dr. Strand. - Water. That's it, Morty. That's my fear. - Thanks, Tanya. All right, who's next on the chopping block. Come on, people, I got a paper to write. - You know, Richard, you think too much for a young guy, you know? Why don't you just relax? Go get laid. - Last call for volunteers. - Yo, I volunteer to get laid, babe. - All right, all right. I'll go. - No. - I'll go. Shh, stop. You don't have to tell me I'm gonna die, Morty. I already know. It's happened many times before. - Excuse me? - We've all lived many lives. - Whether you get to accept that or not? - That's absurd. - Mine has always ended in falling. So, I'm afraid of heights. - All right, maybe that's true. But in this particular lifetime, do you think maybe there's some event that might've triggered that fear? - Not that I can think of. Do you know, Morty? - Look, people, my dad's a minister. Real hellfire and damnation kinda guy. Fear was his stock and trade. He tried to force feed me this nonsense my whole life. But it's just superstition, folks. - What if your dad was right? He could be. - Course, there's no damn god. This woo-woo crystal, aura regression shit, it's a damn rip-off. - Yeah, but maybe somewhere. Maybe you're not so sure. - That's absurd. - He would say something like that. - All right, who's next? - How about Santa? - Yo, yeah, hey, Saint Nick. Ho, ho, baby. Come on. - Yeah, come on. - Yeah, come on, Uncle Pete. - Uncle Pete. - Yeah. - Yeah, come on Uncle Pete. Oh, Morty, Morty, Morty. My old pal. Do you remember me? You know, Santa's biggest fear is that all you little children would grow up and not believe in him anymore. Ho-ho, ho-ho. - Cop out. - You know the Dutch have a belief that Santa's helper will punish all the bad little children. His name is Black Peter. - Come on. - You're not too old for him to get your ass. - Get real. - Hey, reality sucks. It really does, believe me. Fantasy is very, very profitable. - All right. Okay, well, I guess that's it for today. Tomorrow, we'll start up on those individual cases- - No-no, no, baby. Not yet, man. We ain't heard what scares you yet, Freud. - Oh, no-no-no, no-no. - Let's go. I have no fears. I'm all knowing. I'm Therapy Man. No, baby, no. Have a seat. - What about your fear of marriage? Get up there. - That's right. - Boop, you're on, baby? Come on. - All right. Yay, whoo! You're in the hot seat. All right, all right I have a fear of commitment, I'll admit. My mom died here, in this house, when I was a kid. She was pregnant. So it was a double loss. Everything fell apart then. My dad and I, we, We couldn't look each other in the eye after that. I don't know why. So he sent me away. Diametric. - So, it all boils down to- - Diametric. - Diamond trick. - What? Diametric, di- - Yo, man, you're whacking me out here. What's you afraid of, man? - Of you, Morty. You scare the shit out of me, man. I don't know why. - It's, okay. - Yeah, okay, that's it. It's over. Let's party.

I'll fall. - This is not about falling, Mindy. It's just an image in your subconscious. Now something or someone is holding you back. That's the purpose of the fear.

It's all right. - Hey, hey. Why don't you give the guy some space, damn it? I mean, you're always under foot. - Richard, I need to talk. Can we go somewhere? - Sure. Were you close to that uncle? - God, yes. Especially, since my parents divorced. - So that story about you're being pushed in the pool when you were a kid? - Just a story. It's a lot easier than explaining how you found him drowned his bath. I jumped in. I, um, I tried CPR. I couldn't, He was all I had. I, I kept slipping, slipping. I- - It's okay. It's okay. Do you trust me? Do you? Close your eyes. I'll be right back. Here, I need you to believe this, Tanya. Water is not the real threat. This is what you're afraid of. Human contact and feelings. In Jungian analysis, water represents feelings. Your dreams of drowning, they mean you're submerged in feelings that you're struggling to deal with. - Water can't hurt me. It's not the real threat. - That's right. - Thank you. It's funny. I've only known you a short time. - You know, Uncle Pete's a great guy. He was, he was just trying to help you. - I know. - Yeah. - Mmm, hey, boy. Mmm, mmm. Oh, bastard. - You're gonna regret that, bitch. - Fuck off, bastard. - What the hell were you doing, man? Yo, Vance, open up. - Gerald. There's no one here. Let's just, please. - Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Holy shit. - Guys, I'm serious. There is something weird going on and it has to do with Morty. - Mindy, please. - Wh-Where did he come from? What do, what do we know about him? - My grandfather hired some old Indian guy to carve him. I guess that was back in the early '20s, wasn't it? - Tutante was a local bullshit artist. Claimed to be a powerful shaman, but his tribe died of the smallpox. So he wasn't so powerful after all was he? Is there anything else? - Tutante said when Morty wore clothes in the shop window, you know, people would be compelled to come in and buy. He said he'd worked some magic into the wood. - You mean worked it into his woody. - I heard that one. - Uh-huh, Troy, I'm serious. I talked to his grandson once. - Hey, look, there's no magic going on around here. It's just a lot of bad blood and cruel jokes. Now, if your kids are smart, you'd pack your shit and get out of here. - Hey, Pete. - Uncle Pete. - What's up? - Troy, please, I'd like some privacy. - No-no-no, that's cool. It's cool. Sorry about you and Richard. That sucks. - Yeah, well, Richard only cares about his work. - Yeah, Richard can be an asshole. Fuck him. - Troy. - No, serious. Fuck him straight up. Looky, here. Every girl I ever went out with, as soon as I started to feel a little bit of this here, then they started in dissing on me and expecting shit. No, but what you gave Richard, that shit was real. And if he can't cop to it, then he don't deserve you. There's that smile. I like that smile. - That little punk's trying to make time with Ashley. Look, this breakfast can wait. We're gonna show those kids how to have some fun. - I never knew. - The only reason I went out with Becky is 'cause she was your friend. And then she turned out to be like all the rest of them. - I don't know, I can't do this. - No, Ashley, it's cool. It's cool, yo. - No, you're Richard's best friend. - No, Ashley, it's you and me. Come on. - No, it isn't cool. - You're just a little tease, is that it? - Troy, let go of with me. - Ash, Ash, I'm sorry. Ash, I'm sorry. Ash, come on. - Ho-ho-ho-ho. Ho, boys and girls.

I didn't do anything. - Just Fuckin' relax, man. Les, just- - It's okay. It's okay, really. Les, Les. - Vance, Vance, listen. - Yeah, you run fast? Crazy. - Come on, come on, I'll shoot him. Come on, come on, come on. Don't do this. - Don't do it, man. - What's up? Put this shit away, man. - Are you out of your mind? - Come on, come on, come on. - Why? Put that shit away, man. Don't do that. Don't do that shit, man. Put that away. - Stop! - Motherfucker! Hey, you fucking asshole, man. - Come on. Fuckin' bitch. Just what the fuck is going on here? - He's gonna go to the Fuckin' house. Why's he going to the house? - To get his trunk. - What trunk? - One with the Fuckin' money. The 200 grand. Oh, he embezzled from my company. - That's why he Fuckin' tweaked you. What the fuck you talking about? - It was all his idea. Don't lecture me, Troy, please. - Bitch, I'm gonna kill that bitch. Sloppy bitch. - Where the fuck is he? - Troy, what are you gonna do? He's got a gun. Trunk's still here and no money. - Oh, god. - I'm gonna get Mindy to bed, all right. Somebody get some blankets. - This phone is dead. It working this morning. Well, it ain't now. Yo, you hear that, man? I think he's still outside. He's nowhere in the house. Hey, Tanya, wait. Check that out, man, they got the car. Chill out, man, the car. - Wait, hold on. Oh, shit. - This doesn't make sense. Did he leave on foot? - I don't know, but if I get my hands on that punk I'm gonna- - Listen, we have to do something. One of us should go to town. - No, it's 20 miles away. - What about Christmas Village? There's got to be something there. - Of course, the maintenance truck. That'll take us an hour to walk there. - You walk, I run. - Okay, someone should go with her. - Hey, hey, I'll go with her. - Hey, how's Mindy? - Sleeping, finally. - You okay? Any sign of Gerald? - No, but I'm sure he'll show up. Um, I'll go check in on Mindy, okay. - Look, Ash. - I've been thinking. Vance couldn't have been the campus rapist. He was in Oregon. - So? - So, I'm not sure anymore, about anything. - Tanya, Tanya, wait. Oh, excuse me, I'm sorry, I- - No, it's cool. Chill, I got plenty of room here. It's cool. Les, I've been rough on you and I wanna, ah... I'm sorry. - I'm a big girl. I can take it. - Look, I know you had to run out on me back then and live your own life and shit. It ain't right for me to be dissing you for it all the time. You know what I'm saying? - Hey, I made things so tough on you. God, you don't know how hard it was for me. There wasn't a day that went by that I wasn't thinking about you. Oh God, I felt like a piece of me had been ripped out and I had done the ripping. - But we found each other again. You know like it ain't too late for us. You know? I love your face, Les. - Don't start, please. - You're beautiful, Les. - Oh, baby. No, no, no. - What's the matter? We can't do this. - Come on, Les, don't give me that sister rap. That shit sounded good around the homeboys, but, Les, we only related, 'cause Nan adopted us both. - She didn't adopt us. She owned us? - That don't mean nothing. - Leslie, a baby alone. We don't want another mess on our hands, young lady. - What the fuck you saying, Les? I don't care about that shit. - One day, I just stole you. I snuck into your room and dressed you with this little jumper that I saved for. Then I took you to the park to show you off. There was this lady there and when she saw us, she just simply melted. What a beautiful baby. He looks just like his mother and I was so proud. I was floating. - Yes. Les. - But Nana came, she caught up with us and snatched you from me. She's not his mom, she's his sister. - Oh, fuck her. Forgot about that shit, Les. I love you. You're the only one I ever loved. - You don't understand. The lady had it right. She had it right. She had it right. - What you saying, Les? - I was only 14 years old. What'd you expect me to do? Do you know how hard it was for me? All the guys in town, looking at me. Snickering, whispering. Whore, wherever I went, whore. - Just get the fuck away from me, Les. - Please. What, I'm plague now? - Stay the fuck away from me. - You're just like all the others. - Just get the fuck away from me. - That's what I did. - Get the fuck away from me. Leave me alone, goddamn it. - Then go! Leave me alone. Tanya! Tanya! - Pete? Is that you? Tanya. Tanya! Tanya , come over here. Come over here. Tanya. Tanya. Tanya, ah-ha. Tanya. - Pete? Tanya. Tanya. - Is that you? Tanya. - Pete! Tanya. Tanya. - Tanya, Tanya. Tanya, damn it where are you? Tanya! Oh, sweet Jesus. Not again. Tanya, Tanya! Oh, the hell with her. Troy, there you are. I'm sorry, baby. Please try and understand. I did the best I could damn it. Oh, Troy, please talk to me, please. Please, how many times do I have to say I'm sorry. Damn it will you look at me? Missed you, Richie. - Mindy? Mindy, what's going on? I didn't forget about you. Motherfucker! - Morty. - Matricide. - Look what you did. - No. Matricide. Mother killer. - No, no. Richie. Richie. Mom's gonna have a lay down. - Stop it, Morty. You just play. - Stop it, Morty. And let mommy rest. - Shut up. No, shut up. That's mommy's boy. - Richard. Oh, get off. Get out of here. - Ow! - Get out of here. - No! - Oh, Troy, oh my god. Terrible things are happening. - Terrible things happen all the time, man. - Troy, I'm so scared. I'm so glad you're here. - Thank you're so damn special, don't you? You's putting on all them haughty airs and shit. Except when it comes right down to it, you're just a little whore like all the rest of them, ain't ya? - Oh, god, it was you all along? - Except you don't wanna spread them do you? You're just looking for a free little ride, huh? Well, you think this is some kind of free ride, you little whore? Is that it? That what you want? Where did you get that cut from, son? - Oh, God, no, Dad? Dad, no, no. Where's your mother when you need her? - Rosie? Oh, no. Rosie. Claude, what are you, what are you doing? How could you? How could you? Claude, what are you doing? How could you! Stop it! Rosie! Stop it! Stop it! - What are you looking at, huh? This is your own goddamn fault, you understand that? You tell anybody about this and Morty'll get you. You understand me? Do you understand me? Morty will get you. - No, Morty, no, I didn't tell. - Bugs! Bastards! Bugs! Bugs! Get them off me! - Have you seen Tanya? - Uncle Pete, its my fault. - She wasn't even with you. - No-no, no, it's my fault about mom. I caught her with another man. I told dad and he killed her. He killed her. I remember it. - That's a lot of bullshit. There was only one man she loved. One true love in her life. - No, listen to me! She was always controlling me. I wanted her off my back and I got her killed. I got her killed, Uncle Pete. - You get that shrink crap out of your head. I get the truck. You get your stuff out of the car. - What happened? - He was the rapist. I killed him. - It's okay, come- - I'm fine. - Listen to me, I'm gonna get you outta here, okay. - All right, I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine. - Diametric... it's an anagram for matricide. - No, you didn't kill your mother. You said your father did. - It's me, I'm responsible, Ashley. - No, no, it means the opposite, diametric. You're the victim. You're not guilty. Oh my, you don't think Pete? - Tanya? - I hope I'm not too late. - You wait there all right. Wait right there. Where's Tanya? - Fuck Tanya. - It was you. - Don't you look at me like that. - Oh, fuck no. That was your baby inside her. - You told, you told. You know what happens to little boys that tattle? You know what happens? - Don't give me that Santa shit now, you son of a bitch! - You know what happens to boys that tattle? - Yeah, they get fucked up. - You know what happens to bad boys? - What? - Black Peter gets there ass. - Ashley, run! Go! Uncle Pete. - Richard, come on. Come on. Richard! Richard! - It's the clearing in my dream. Get out. Oh, my god. - Let it go, Richard. Richard, over there! Go, Ash, go! - No! - Go! No, no. - The missing piece is inside. - Ashley? Ashley! Ashley! Ashley! - No, no-no! - You son of a bitch. - Morty, let go! Morty, no. You can't do this. It's over now. It's over. I understand everything now. Everything. I'm not afraid, Morty. That's it. Now, let her go. I'm not afraid. Now you've got to leave. Let us go, Morty. I love you. - Yeah, come in. Hello, Richard. - Hello? Hey. I uh... Sorry about your sphere. - Yeah, well, I heard about the investigation. Yeah. - Well, we missed you at class today. - Yeah. I, uh... I'm dropping out. I want you to be the first to know. - Wanna tell me why? - I uh, I found the missing piece all right. But I, I lost a hell of a lot along the way. Also got a bunch of cops who want answers that I don't have. I guess the quest for wholeness is not all it's cracked up to be. - Well, it's a moment to moment thing, Richard. I mean you can't live now until you make your peace with then. - Then what? - Then now. You get to live now. - Thank you. - Yeah. Come here, honey. Wait for us. Okay, Mom. Oh, I love the daffodils. - Look at the great woodwork. - Folks, this is a terrific deal. - Yes? - The previous owner wants to let it go at a very, very low price. - Oh, why, why is that? - Well, I'll be honest with you, Mr. Field. There've been some tragedies here. - Oh! - Tragedies? Oh, what sort of tragedies. - Before I tell you about that, come on inside. It is a phenomenal house. - All right.
