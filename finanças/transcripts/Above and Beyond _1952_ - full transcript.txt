Mrs. Tibbets. The plane is 30 min. Late. Would you like to wait inside? Oh, no thank you. Here I am, waiting again. It seems like I'm always waiting. Waiting for the sound of a plane that will bring my husband home. Only, this time, I don't know whether I still have a husband, whether he still wants his home, or whether this is finally the end. The end of the road for Paul and me. But where did it start? When did it start? I suppose it was a little over 2 years ago in that cold gray morning over North of Africa back in 1943. A squadron of B-17's, was flying a daylight precision bombing mission against Bizerte at 6,000ft. Paul was leading that mission. That was the beginning. That was the first chapter in a story that meant a lot to Paul and to me, but meant even more to everybody on this Earth. Look at that stuff, Tibb! It's worse than yesterday. You can walk on it. Group Commander to all pilots: Approaching target. Keep the formation tight. Deputy to Group Commander: Group Commander: go ahead. That bunch up ahead's getting clobbered. If we don't go upstairs, we'll get it worse. How about a change of flight plan? Group Commander to Deputy: We'll fly the mission as briefed. Okay Pilot to navigator: how're we doing, Dutch? Smack on course. Ferebee's on the target. Pilot to bombardier: let's make this a good one, Tom. Bombs away! Let's get out of here. - 6,000ft. It's murderous bloody suicide. - Who's trying to prove what? Field orders, Col., for this afternoon. Bizerte again. - What altitude? - 6,000. - Is GEN Roberts in his office? - Yes sir. I'm running two B-17 bombing missions over Bizerte every day, using every plane and crew that we've got left. Now, if we destroy Bizerte, we cut off supplies and reinforcement by sea, and extend Rommel's line of supply by over 1,000mi. Yes, I ah see you have four 25-mission commanders. - Johnson, Angstrom, Miller, and Tibbets. - Yes, and I'm plenty short-handed at that. - All pretty good men? - First rate Now personally I've always held if you've got a small pocket, you've got to go in low to get hits. Sam, I want to meet these men as soon as possible. - You can't have them Verne. - I just want to meet them. I don't care what this is, I'm not giving them up. If you want hot shot fliers, go to England. - They've got personnel... - I've been to England, that's why I'm here. Alright Verne, what've you got? Sam, we're getting the living tar kicked out of us, on nearly every front, and that's official. I was at the Pentagon last Thursday. England is taking a terrible pounding. No one knows how long she can hold out. We may have to hit Germany and Japan direct from U.S. possessions and that means an airplane with range, real range. And Hap Arnold thinks we've got the baby that can do it. Boeing designed it. It's called the B-29. And it'll fly higher, faster and farther than any bomber you ever dreamed about. But there's one little hitch. The B-29 is a death trap. It's already killed Eddie Allen and some of Boeing's crack test pilots. We've got to get the bugs out of that airplane, Sam, and every minute, every second counts. We need a man who can test fly it and modify it for combat at the same time, and that's why I'm here. I want a four-engine combat commander for that job, one with experience and guts. Underline guts. I wish I could help you, Verne. (knock on door) Well my hands are tied. I haven't even got enough men or... - Well? - Col. Tibbets would like to see you sir. - I'm busy. - I told him, but he insists, sir. - He says it's very important. - Alright, show him in. - Yes, sir. Alright Tibbets, what is it? - This field order, sir, is it correct? - That's right. you're to go back over Bizerte this afternoon. - At 6,000 ft.? - That is correct. In my opinion, GEN Roberts, this order's a mistake. At 6,000 ft. we're sitting ducks. I lost two crews this morning and four in the past 24 hours. We can't expect to get results without losses, Tibbets. We'll take our losses, sir, but I don't believe in throwing crews away. I can get results, good results, and I can get them at 21,000 ft. Your order says 6,0000. - An order can be changed, sir. - Col. Tibbets, When a commander starts blaming his troubles on his orders, I can't help wondering if he isn't turning... Well, if he hasn't had a little more combat than he can take. Alright GEN Roberts, let's go back over Bizerte this afternoon at 6,000. I'll fly the lead plane and you'll ride as my co-pilot. You'll fly the mission as briefed. That's all, Col. Tibbets. Yes, sir. Oh, Arnie, On that promotion of Tibbets to full COL, disapproved. Yes, sir. Sorry, sir. - Has he popped off like this before? - No, sir. I want to handle this personally. - Have Tibbets report to my quarters immediately. - Yes, sir. I witnessed that exhibition you put on in GEN Roberts office this morning. Can you think of any reason why you shouldn't be court-martialed? I guess not, sir. It's behavior hardly consistent with your record. 25 missions over France and Africa; man chosen to fly Clark and Eisenhower down here for the invasion... - Do you think you're suffering from combat fatigue? - No, sir. - What's your defense? - No excuse, sir. You know, Tibbets, I've always been a hunch player. Oh, I've been kicked in the pants a couple of times, but... by and large I've had a pretty fair country average. I should throw the book at you, but instead I'm going to give you a job, - a big job back in the states. - Yes, sir. Get your gear together and be on my airplane at 09:00. - Is that all, sir? - That's all. Yes, sir. Oh, Tibbets, aren't you just a little curious about what this job is? I assume, sir, when you're ready to tell me, you'll tell me. See you on the plane. GEN Brent. Contact Larry Norstead. Request LTC Tibbets transferred to the states. Coffee's on. Thanks, sir, just had one. My main diet. What're you doing there? It's a kind of a gag I have with my wife. Every time I come home, I always bring her a bottle of her favorite perfume. Then why the paper bag? Oh, I don't know. First time I did it I guess I was a little embarrassed or something anyway I just put it in a paper bag; tied a pink ribbon around it. - I guess it's a little corny. - Oh, I don't know. I've known a lot of men who had great difficulty revealing emotion. - It's a quality that's sometimes is indispensable. - Yeah, I guess so. You know Tibbets there's one aspect of this B-29 job I don't think I fully covered. - What's that, sir? - Pretty touchy airplane, checking it out isn't going to be any tea party. We can't have any distractions. I'd prefer you didn't bring your wife out to Wichita. That's pretty rugged, sir. I haven't seen Lucy in over 2 years. - A little guy named Paul Jr. I've never seen. - I know. How much leave do I get before I head out to Wichita? How's 30 min. at the airport? I see. Sorry, Paul. Just tell her I'm the heavy. Now Lucy, brace yourself. He'll probably breeze right by with a Moroccan kootch dancer on each arm. - Harry, please. - Thin ones, you're only allowed 40lbs. of baggage. You're a million laughs, Harry, but why didn't you stay home? Cause he's afraid Paul might spend one night with his family before he can get him into a poker game. Lucy, there's Tibb! Marge, here, hold him. - Oh, Paul! Paul! - Honey! - Oh, it's so good! - I know, I know. Come on, Tibb, break it up! - Harry! How are you? - Fine - Well you're looking fine. - And you too, boy. - Hello, Marge. - Hi - Hey, what's this? You got one too? - Meet Paul Tibbets Jr. No kiddin'! So big! Hey how about that? Hey look he likes it up there. He's a real bird man. - Hey, hey what about the chickens? When I left you were up a full COL - Ah I run into a wrong hunk of brass. - Yeah, what happened? - Ah, nothing much. Well he's a good fella. You think we're going to get along fine? Oh, honey, honey it's past his nap time. You'll have plenty of time to get acquainted at home. You tell your mommy that, we'll get acquainted alright but not just now. You tell your mommy that daddy's got to catch a plane for Wichita. - Wichita? When? - 30 minutes. - Oh, no! - I'm sorry, dear. Wichita? That's that B-29 job? Hey, you the guy's going to fly those tests? Say, that's a rough one mate. - You know, Harry, you talk too much? - Yeah, yeah, that's part of my charm. Special flight for Wichita, leaving in 20 min. You two will want to be alone. Why don't we take the baby and you can pick him up later? Thanks, Marge. - Ah look, Tibb ah... - It's over boy. Ah, if you could ever use me again, I mean, well, I'm getting tired of that Pentagon. It's too big for Bratton... What I mean is if you ever need a four-engine driver for any airplane... Yeah, I'll keep it in mind, Harry. - Okay, thanks, good luck, Tibb. - Thanks. - Bye Marge - Bye A little something for behind the ears You never forget, do you, Paul? If I ever do... - How about a cup of coffee? - Fine. I... I was happy to hear about Harry and Marge moving in next door. It must have been a big help. Yes, they were. - How's the... How's the car holding up? - Fine. - No wrinkled fenders? - No, not yet. - Tires okay? - Re-treads. Paul, is it really a death trap, the B-29? - Of course not. Whatever gave you the... - It's the plane Eddie Allen and his crew were killed in last month. Isn't it? It's just another airplane, darling, only bigger and safer. - Don't you go worrying about it. - Paul, I... Special flight 209, loading at gate 9 for Wichita. I'll be home, darling, just as soon as I can. Don't make it long, Paul. We've got a lot of catching up to do. Special flight 209 now ready for departure Ready for departure. - The story of our lives. - Yeah Well... Well I... Well I ought to be real Air Force and say "Happy landings; flaps up; I'll be seeing you" or something... I just can't. Lucy... I don't know if it ever came across in my letters, but... if I didn't have you, I wouldn't have anything. Oh, Paul! - Be careful, darling. Promise me you'll be careful. - 'kay, sure, safety first that's Tibbets. - Promise me. - Stop worrying sugar. It's just another airplane. Just another airplane... and that's what the B-29 was. Just another enormous glittering airplane. 67 tons of experimental bomber that flew like a dream, under normal conditions. But Paul had to find out what the airplane would do under combat conditions. What would happen, for instance, when you took it up to 30,000 ft.? He soon found out. Gun blisters would go popping out, almost taking some fine young turret gunner with them. And there was always fire. Fire in the engines; fire in the bomb bays; fire on the ground. Constant emergency landings. They had to know how the B-29 would perform under all weather conditions. In snow; in hail; in rain. Days stretched into weeks, the weeks into months. Oh yes, they let me come to Wichita to visit him once. But once was enough. That was the day Paul lost an engine; his landing gear jammed; and he had to attempt a crash landing. I'll never forget the terror I felt as I stood there, unable to do anything but watch. Watch him as he made that turn for his final approach. Fuel off, switches off! Fuel off, switches off! I just couldn't take it. I left Wichita that night, and I didn't even see Paul again for three months. The next time we met was at a little cabin I found near Hagerstown. It wasn't easy for Paul, but he managed to steal a few hours. I'm sure if GEN Arnold knew how dear those hours were to Paul and me, he wouldn't have minded. You know, I'll never forget the way you looked the first day I saw you selling dry goods. - What was the name of that store? - GS Meekins, 9th and Main, cheesecloth a specialty. You looked cute behind that counter. Pity, I could only see half of you. And a week later you proposed to that half. - Right across that counter. - Yeah, but I got the whole girl. Thank heavens. So crazy. Here we are married 5 years; parents of a 2-year-old child; and yet all we've really lived together is a total of about 7 weeks. Kinda get the feeling you're up here with a stranger? Not in Columbus Georgia, no nice girl ever felt about a stranger, the way I feel about you. So, winter turned to spring, spring to summer, and Paul and his men worked on the B-29. They worked on the engine; the hydraulic system; on every part of the airplane. What we didn?t know was that all this time, Paul was being watched. Every move he made was discussed by GEN Brent with GEN Cavey Wolf, and COL Bill Irvine, Paul's immediate superiors on the project. Finally, it was over. The B-29 was modified. It was ready for combat. The plane was in mass production, and Paul Tibbets could fly home to his family. Which, incidentally, was on its way to being enlarged. Oh, it was wonderful. The way I'd always dreamed it would be. The family together, Paul relaxed and contented. Perfectly willing to fall in love with and spoil his two-and-a-half-year-old son. And why not? That's what a two-and-a-half- year-old son is for. I'll never forget the night it happened. We'd saved up our gas coupons and were packing for a week in the mountains. A week of fishing and boating and... well a week away from everything but each other. It gets cold up there at night. We'd better take an extra blanket. Who needs blankets? - Don't answer. - Ah, it's probably just Harry and Marge calling up to say goodbye. Hello, Yes, this is Col. Tibbets. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Right Yes, sir. When? I have to report to Colorado Springs in the morning. I know, I know, how much is a girl supposed to take? Someday, I?m gonna have a baby and you're gonna be there when he's born. Or when she's born. This time, I'll be there, sugar, I promise. Well, at least you're all packed. - Col. Tibbets sir? - That's right. May I see your pass, sir? Right this way, sir. - Col. Tibbets? - Yes. - My name's Willy Uanna. - Hiya MAJ - Sit down, sir. - Thank you. If there are any more of these birddogs, I'm gonna have to get a new AGO card. On the night of September 17, 1942, in a restaurant of Claridge?s Hotel in London, you had dinner with a Gp Capt Bulton of the RAF and two American MAJ's. Right? Could be. Did you discuss that morning's raid on occupied France? Possibly, in a general terms. On June 14, 1943, in the coffee shop at the airport at Cincinnati you had breakfast with a Dr. Swanson. Did you discuss the North African campaign? - Perhaps, generally. - Have you ever been arrested? No. September 2, 1927, Miami Municipal Court, District 16. Defendant P. W. Tibbets arrested doing 70mph in a 20mph zone. In custody 24hrs, fined $10. - Look I was only 16 years... - Why don't you drink? It makes me sick. Alright Col., come with me. - Hello Paul. I'm glad to see you. - Thank you, sir. I see you've met MAJ Uanna. Have a nice friendly chat? Well I ah, I'm not sure. - Will that be all, sir? - Yes, thank you MAJ. Uh, sit down, Paul. Thank you, sir. - How was the trip? - Very nice, sir. Good Paul, we're looking for a man for a job. You've been under a microscope for 12 months now along with several hundred senior commanders in the Air Force. The field narrowed itself down to 20 men and finally 4. A Brigadier Gen, two full COL's and a light Col., yourself. You're the youngest and lowest in rank, but we've got to have the man least likely to make a mistake. On my strong recommendation, you're to get first cut at it. What have you got, GEN? Well Paul, before I answer that, I've got to ask you a question. What does that look like? - A buzzer. - That's right, a buzzer. Suppose I told you that if you press that little buzzer, you might stop the war tomorrow. That you'd save half a million American lives and probably as many of the enemy. But by pressing that buzzer, you'd have to kill 100,000 people in one flash. What would you do? Take your time. Be sure, Paul. From this point, there's no turning back. click Have the gentlemen come in. - Good morning, CAPT - Hello. - Dr. Ramsey. - Good morning. Gentlemen, I'd like you to meet LTC Paul Tibbets. Paul, this is CAPT Parsons, our naval representative. - How do you do? - Good morning sir. - Dr. Ramsey - Doctor. - Col. Dr. Sloan. - How do you do? - How are you? - Dr. Van Dyke. - Hello. - How are you? - This is Dr. Fiske. - Make yourselves comfortable. Paul, these men are all of the Manhattan District Project. You?ll learn more about that later on. Dr. Ramsey, suppose you lead off? Very well. Col. Tibbets. Have you ever heard of atomic energy? - Yes sir, a little. - What do you know about it? Wh... not much... I've heard that a small amount of it could drive an ocean liner 2 or 3 times around the world. It can do more than that, Tibbets. The right amount of nuclear material; in the correct projectile; dropped under the proper circumstances; would have the explosive force of 20,000 tons of TNT. Our government is engaged, at this moment, in developing just such an atomic bomb. CAPT Parsons. You understand, Col. Tibbets, that this is still very much on paper? No atomic bomb has as yet been fired, but ah, we're working on the assumption that the bomb will work. And it follows that, every part of the system; for flying the bomb to the target; and releasing it on the target; must be as reliable as human beings can make it. That's where you come in, Paul. You're to command a B-29 outfit charged with the responsibility of delivering an atomic bomb over an enemy target. You will be solely responsible for the selection of personnel; training of crews; and development of flight tactics. CAPT Parsons and Dr. Ramsey will be your liaison with the scientists in Los Alamos. I will be your only, underline only, link with the air force. You have top priority. The code word is Silverplate, but don't use it unless it's absolutely necessary. - Do you understand that? - Yes, sir. MAJ Uanna will be your security officer. This must be the best kept secret of the war. You're to talk to no one; write nothing down. Commit all essential information to memory. You will have to fake, steal, cajole, connive, or whatever it takes to get what you'll need. But you'll have to do it without arousing undue speculation. Do you gentlemen have anything further to add? - No, I don't think so. Good luck, Col. - Thank you, gentlemen, MAJ Good luck. - See you, Col. - Yes, sir. Paul, you're going to be dealing with a lot of top brass. If you were a full COL, you'd have more muscle. But I can't work it, not just yet. You sure made yourself a beautiful enemy in Africa. - Roberts? - Yes. If I barreled it through now, over his objection, there'd be too much talk. We can't have that. Be patient, you'll get it. Thank you, sir. Oh uh, one final thing: No one's ever dropped an atom bomb before. No one knows what happens when it goes off. I can't give you any guarantee that your plane will ever come back. A guarantee didn't come with the uniform, sir. All I can say is, I'd trade the entire Second Air Force and these two stars for the chance you're getting. A chance to end this war without an invasion of Japan. - Good luck. - Thank you, sir. My God! When Paul called, he was very casual. He told me it was just another routine assignment, nothing unusual. And that he'd be away a couple of months. I was disappointed, of course. But when he promised he'd be home in time for the baby, I guess I just didn?t give it another thought. So, Paul went to work on operation Silverplate. First, he had to find a base, a million miles from nowhere. Where security could be controlled and there was room to do your work. And that meant Wendover: Wendover, Utah. With a delightful range in temperature: Summer 110°; Winter 32° below. It meant handpicking the cream of the Air Force. Bringing them to Wendover from all parts of the world. It meant bringing in the best instructors in the business, and to Paul, that meant Tom Ferebee: bombardier; Dutch van Kirk: navigator; Wyatt Duzenbury: flight engineer; Bob Lewis: pilot instructor; and Harry Bratton: director of training. And it meant stealing the hottest combat group in the Air Force, a crack squadron of 15 B-29's; their crews; and personnel. All combat veterans, the talk was they could drop a doughnut into a cup of coffee from 20,000ft. - Hey, these boys are pretty sharp. - They will be. Alright Tibb, we broke our necks to get here, so, we're here. Now, why all the hush hush? What's up? Price of butter. If this is such a big deal, Tibb, how come they didn't make you a full COL? I couldn't take all that money. It'd put me in too high a tax bracket. Tibbets to all the pilots: You'll land immediately and assemble your crews in front of headquarters. Tibbets out. Alright give me your attention. you're now part of the 509th composite group. I know you're all wondering what this outfit's up to. The first thing I want you to do is to quit wondering and stop worrying. You're all combat veterans and you've been handpicked by me because you rated the top B-29 squadron in the Air Force. Just watched you work and you're good, darn good. But you're going to have to be twice that good just to get washed out of this outfit. There's going to be a lot of talk about Wendover the next few months and I expect each and every one of you to keep his mouth shut. You tell people that you're in a B-29 bomb group and you're going overseas, but no more. Each of you has a job that can shorten the war. The risks may be big, but the stakes are bigger. Anybody wants out, he can ask for a transfer, no questions asked. But mark my words, once you decide to stay in 509th, any breach of security or letting down on the job will get you into more trouble than you ever dreamed existed. Any questions? Now, a word from our chief security officer, MAJ Uanna. Now, understand this. This base, it is under strict military security. You will find there are many restricted areas. Each with a separate pass, and each pass a different color. The MP's on this base, are specially trained and fully armed. They have specific orders: Should anyone be found in a restricted area without a proper pass, they have orders to shoot. And shoot to kill. What you've heard here today you've heard for the first and last time. Remember it. It's not to be discussed: on the base; off the base; or anyplace else. Alright, as of now you're all on a ten-day furlough. Go anyplace you like but keep your mouths shut. Dismissed. So, the boys took off for home in all parts of the country. By bus; by plane; by train. But this was more than a vacation. It was a security check. Special agents were assigned to check points across the entire nation. Paul had to know who were the talkers, and who weren't. - Where're you headed, Lt.? - Home. - And where's that? - Where my mother lives. Where's that? With my father. Most of the boys were on the beam, but there were a few who weren't. It must be big stuff. We got the best pilots; the best navigators; the best bombardiers in the whole Air Force. Now you know those guys aren't there to play tidily winks. And there were a few others: in Boston. - Whaddya fly? - Well I used to be in fighters. Big stuff now, B-29's. In Minneapolis. - What kind of a bombsight do they use? - Norden. But they didn't talk twice. When you left here, I told you to keep your mouths shut, and I meant it. You're under arrest and subject to Court Martial. Maybe you'll know now when I say security, I mean security. Dismissed. - Let 'em sweat it out for a week then release them. See if this news gets around. - Yes, sir. - How am I doing? - You're learning. You know, Bill, you security boys are pretty thorough but there's one little risk you're slipping up on. - What's that? - Me. - Why so? - Well I'm only human, maybe you ought to put a couple of your boys on me. Yesterday you were in Los Alamos in civilian clothes. At one o'clock you were in the commissary with Dr. Ramsey and 4 other scientists. At 1:45 you lit a cigarette and dropped these on the table. Air Force matches. The last thing we want to is to tie up atomic energy and airplanes. Remember? My apologies. You're not slipping up on anything. As a matter of fact, I am. Serious problem: women. - You know most of our men are married. - Well after all, this is war. We've all got to give up a little something. I'm referring to talk, woman talk. Speculation about this project by wives: in beauty shops, grocery stores, and bridge parties from Portland, Oregon to Bangor, Maine. You can't police the whole country. Enough women in enough places do enough talking. Someone's going to find out something we don't want them to know. What do you want me to do? Bring 'em all out here to Wendover? - Exactly. - I'm running an air base, not a country club. We can have those families here in two weeks? time. Families, that means schools, playgrounds, hospitals. Do you know what this place would look like? Just like any other ordinary Air Force training center. Certainly not the key base of a top secret atomic bombing mission. You're right, of course. I wish I'd thought of it first. - Put it in the works. The women come out to Wendover. - Good. I could use a home cooked meal myself. I wouldn't do that, Paul. You're one man who shouldn't bring his wife out here. - Why not? - I think you're going to be too tough to live with. Your wife can never be part of you. She can never share what you know; what you think; or what you feel. You're going to make a terrible father and a worse husband. That plus Wendover is too much to ask of any woman. - You don't know Lucy. - She's a woman. - She's my wife. - And you're going to bring her out here to have a baby. - After the baby. - I'd think about that pretty carefully, if I were you. That's all MAJ So, the wives came to Wendover, with one notable exception. Paul didn't even write me about it. In fact, Paul didn't even write. I guess he was too busy with problems of his own. Like that little matter of transportation. We need our own transports, Paul, with speed and range. - And we need them fast. - Aw, that's a pretty big order, CAPT - Who's got some C-54's? - GEN Davenport has 6 of them in Benson. Davenport's never turned me down yet. I'll take a crack at it. - I won't be gone long. Clip papers to transport those 54's. - Right. - Saw your door open, GEN, so I... - Well, Tibbets! I was looking for GEN Davenport, sir. Davenport left last week. I'm in command here. - That's fine. Your looking well, GEN - Thank you. - What can I do for you? - Well, it's, it's nothing much, just ah, just another requisition. - Oh? What for? - Some C-54's. - C-54's? Really, how many? - About 6 of them. - Sure 6 will be enough? - Just right, sir. - And how soon would you want them? - Immediately. Why don't you ask for 6 battle ships? Or 6 carriers? - What are you building out there at Wendover, a one-man Air Force? - It says there it's Silverplate sir. My instructions are to give Silverplate top priority. But I also have a responsibility to see that priorities are not abused, by anyone. This is one request you'll have to justify to my complete satisfaction. Very well sir, I can't do my job properly without those C-54's. If it's that urgent, why don't they send somebody with rank? Look, GEN, I flew all last night and I still have to fly back to Wendover. I'm tired, now if you'll please just sign this order I can jus... GEN Brent will have to verify this. - Get him on the phone. - That won't be necessary, sir, GEN Brent gave me the job. All right, requisition refused, insufficient justification. - Then, sir, you better get me relieved of my command. - What? - For failure to carry out my mission. - That's my problem. Unless you can give me a more specific reason, this request is disapproved. Very well, sir. Tibb, I ought to have something in writing from GEN Roberts before I release these planes to you. - I'll take full responsibility, Steve, verbal orders. Okay? - But, Tibb! Don't worry. You'll hear from GEN Roberts any minute now. GEN Roberts to Col. Tibbets, over. This is Tibbets. I can barely hear you GEN, over. Do you realize what you're doing? - I can't read you, GEN - Listen, Tibbets, you're directly violating my... - I order you to land at once. - That's right, sir, I'm sure the weather's going to be okay. I can explain everything when I land at Wendover. For the last time, did you understand what I said? Yes, sir, the papers are right on your desk. I'm going on radio silence for security. Tibbets out. So, Paul got his C-54's. He got bigger airplanes. He got bigger problems. He got bigger headaches. Me? I just got bigger, and lonelier. Paul's letters and phone calls became less and less frequent and told me absolutely nothing. If it hadn't been for Marge Bratton, I wouldn't even have known that the wives were going to Wendover. Bye, honey. Take care of my fella and tell him write. You just have that baby and hurry out there. We're going to have a lot of laughs. - Yeah - Bye. A lot of laughs. I couldn't tell her that I probably wouldn't be coming to Wendover, that my husband hadn't even bothered to ask me out. I guess that was my low point. I felt lonely and unwanted, and unattractive, and pretty generally sorry for myself. I didn't have long to think about it. For just then, I knew I had to get to the hospital. And fast. I don't remember much about that ride. Except that, thank heaven I left Paul Jr. with his grandma Tibbets. Enola Gay Tibbets. Enola. What a funny name, I kept thinking. Enola. Backwards, it spelled "alone". I guess that's why I thought of it. I never felt more alone in my whole life. - Did you call my husband? - We tried several times, Mrs. Tibbets, he can't be reached . - Oh, no! - I'll try again, soon. At that moment, I hated Paul. He promised to be with me and he wasn't. It was careless and callous and thoughtless I don't suppose it would have mattered even if I'd known he was 6,000mi. away at Guam. Discussing flight tactics with GEN LeMay. At that moment, I wouldn't have cared how hard was he working. How the burden of responsibility was beginning to show. How tired he was. Well, what's the verdict? - Tactics approved. - Good - I want to see the operational reports: flying and ordinance. - They're all right here. Now, why don't you get some sleep, Paul? Take care of it tomorrow. Tomorrow is yesterday. - Good night, Paul. - Good night, Bill. I don't want to be disturbed. No phone calls no interruptions, nothing. Yes, sir. - I thought I told you... - Direct line from Washington, sir. Oh, okay. Hello Hello, sugar, how are you? - A boy! - 6lb. 8oz. Oh, he's so cute, Paul! He, he's got your eyes and, and red hair and... I should have been there, darling. I let you down. But, believe me. I couldn't help it. It doesn't matter darling, not anymore. Just tell me, when I'm coming to Wendover? Aw Luce, it's... it's pretty rugged out here. With a new baby and all... Look, Paul, I don't care how rugged it is or how rough. This family's going to get together and stay together. I'm going to come out there just as soon as I'm strong enough. All right? Well... Sure, it's all right. Come out as soon as you're strong enough. It'll work out fine. Oh, Paul. I... I want you to do something for me. I want you to get some cigars and a bottle of champagne and go out and really shake the town. I want the world to know we've got a brand- new baby boy and... and how much I love his old man. I miss you, Lucy. Good night darling. See you soon. Sure, goodnight. Congratulations, pal. Oh, I'd have been lost without you, Mary. I hope we didn't ruin your trip. Mrs. Tibbets, Billy and I were married just two days before he was sent here. Nothing could ruin this trip. I'm on my way to a honeymoon! That makes two of us. Oh, that's Paul! Oh! - Would you like me to hold him? - Would you, Mary? Oh, thanks dear. Thanks Hello, sugar! Well, look who's here! - Hi, daddy! - How big can you get in 6 months? - Pretty big. - Yes sir, show me your muscle. - Oh boy, you glad to see your daddy? - Sure, my dad's the boss here. - Who said so? - Mommy. Oh, well, she ought to know. - Come on, darling. - Oh, Mrs. Tibbets! You forgot something! - What's that? - Nothing much, just your youngest son. - Thank you, Mary. Thanks for everything. - You're welcome. Well say, we better give him a lift. It's a pretty long walk. Well, there he is. A 1944 model Tibbets FOB Wendover. - So, this is Wendover? - It's not exactly Palm Springs, but it'll do. Over there's what we laughingly call our officers club. There's gonna be a dance there tonight, you'll meet all the bunch. - Well, what about a sitter? - He's driving the car. There's the church. Used for everything from novenas to Yom Kippur. Then the hospital. - Just about everything here you'll need. - That's for sure. - What are those fellows over there? - Where? - Over there, in the white suits. - Oh, those fellas? Well they're um... Well they're um... They're sanitary engineers. They're in charge of sanitation. - Whew, that's nice. - And on this side is our new housing project. Well, here we are. It's just darling, Paul. It's cute as it can be. - Daddy, where's the sidewalk? - Well, this house doesn't have a sidewalk. - Why not? - Just doesn't, dear. Oh ah, darling, this is Sergeant Wilson. He just came over to straighten things up a little. - Thanks a lot, sergeant. It's very nice of you. - Thank you, ma'am. - Did you get the drapes? - Yes sir, the ones you picked out. Hung 'em just the way you wanted. Thanks. Mommy! I don't like this house! - Oh shh, honey. - And it doesn't even have a sidewalk! Never mind dear. You, you run out and help with the men. That's a good boy. 'course it may need a little touching up, here and there. They're, they're all alike. The other, the other couple just moved out. - If there's anything you don't like... - No, it's fine Paul just fine. Nice and cozy. - 'course there's, there's just one little thing. These, these drapes... - Yeah, well, well they've got to go. Ah they're pretty bad. And here's the ah, the dining area down here. Good solid table. Yes. And, and the refrigerator of course, over here, seems to be in pretty good shape. Ah, looks like it needs a little ice. And this is uh, this is a cute little gadget here. This is ah, this is a coal stove. It throws a nice even heat. - Well ah, where do you get the coal, honey? - Oh, that's, that's in a bin out in the, out in the back. And this ah, it's a great sink. Ah, hot and cold running water. - Oh I, I can fix that. Just get a screw and tighten it. - As long as the water's hot, that's all that counts. And... and the uh cupboards. The bedrooms, I think, are right around the back here. - Any, anyplace there. - Yes, sir. - Oh, and Paul let's, let's look at the bedrooms, huh. - 'kay. - Can you make it? - Yes, sir. - Ah you can just sit that anywhere. - And you better be careful because my dad is the boss here. Never mind, dear. This is the ah, this is the kids' room. It's clean and airy. - Oh, it's fine Paul, just fine. - Mommy, where's my room? - This is it, honey. - I want a room of my own. - Ah, never mind that. You go outside and play. - But there's no sidewalk! That doesn't matter, sweetheart, go on. Ah, the ah bridal suite is just around here. Well it, it isn't exactly the Waldorf, but ah... It's got nice twin beds and ah... and good, good springs, and cross draft ventilation. We'll have to get a screen or something here. And of course, the ah, the closet over there. And ah... Ah it's a mess, isn't it? Oh, darling, it's wonderful. As long as we're together, what difference does it make? I'll get it. Tibbets Yeah? Eh, okay. - I better get over to headquarters right away. Sorry to leave you alone. - It's alright honey. Run along. I'll manage. - Goodbye, shorty. - I sure wish we had a sidewalk. Right away. It's alright, honey. Mommy's coming. This I don't get at all. Well, it's not difficult, MAJ. He really wants to find out what the maximum gross weight of this plane can be at takeoff. I thought that fact was established when he took the plane out at Wichita. This airplane's been modified since then. Alright, fellas, let's go. - Four tons over maximum. You gotta be crazy to try this. - Want to get out and watch? Just tell me one thing: Why couldn't the Wright brothers have been interested in streetcars? - What do you say, Deuce? - Cowl flaps 15?, cylinder head temperatures normal. 70,... 75,... 95,... 100,... 105,... 120, 125,... 130,... 130,... 130,... 135,... 135, 140,... 140 Gear up. Missed it. - Sugar? - Yes, please. Okay, spill it. - I'm glad you're here, Lucy, real glad. - You said that before. For you, for Paul, and more important, for the base. - What does that mean? - Look, I'm going to lay this on the line. Alright Well, there's a kind of a feeling around here that Paul's playing this thing awfully big. - Paul? - These men are seasoned combat veterans, the best in the business. Harry says Paul treats them like they're still at Kelly Field. - But... - The talk is they're good enough for Eisenhower but not for Tibbets. - That's standard sour grapes and you know it. - Look, honey, Paul's only human. Everybody knows what happened in Africa. Well it's only natural that when he gets his first important command, he'll try to make an impression and, get those eagles back. Don't you ever say anything like that to me again, Marge! - Now, Lucy... - Whatever Paul's done, he's done because it's part of his job. Believe me, he's way overboard. Passes for this, passes for that. You can't buy a jar of pickles around here without passing a loyalty test. Did it ever occur to you that this job may be something really important? Did you ever hear of a really important assignment where they let them bring wives and kids where they put a light COL in command? - Maybe Paul's just tired. - Maybe - And maybe you're wrong to! - Maybe Just keep your eyes open. Oh, look Lucy, you know Harry and I have always been crazy about Paul. And we'd like to keep it that way. - I know, honey. - I've gotta run. See you tonight at the club? Yeah, sure - Did you enjoy your trip, Mrs. Tibbets? - Very much, thank you. - How long you planning to stay? - Oh, long as I'm welcome, I guess. - When does Col Tibbets say we'll be leaving? - Guess you'll have to ask Col. Tibbets about that. Can I cut in? - Thank you, ma'am. - Yes. Thank you, sir. You certainly have a nice bunch of boys here, Paul. But they're the nosiest fellows I've ever seen. - Are they? - The way they rushed me you'd think I was Miss America. - Should we tell the little lady the facts? - Harry, I think you've had too much to drink. - Look, honey, far be it from me to detract from your personal charms... - That's enough. - But those were security agents you were dancing with. Big handsome security agents... - I said that's enough! Marge, you better take Harry home, put him to bed. He has to fly tomorrow. - Is that an order, Col. Tibbets? - If that's the way you want it. - Very well. Good night, Lucy. - Good night, Harry. - Come on, honey. - Good night This guy's taking all the fun out of modern warfare. Well, it's getting late. Come on nurse, let's hit the sack. - Good night Tibb, good night Lucy - Good night, Lucy. Good night, MAJ. Would you care to dance, Mrs. Tibbets? Thank you, MAJ but we should run along too. Dear, I think we should be at home by the children. - Right. Goodnight, Bill. - Goodnight Paul, Mrs. Tibbets Goodnight. Well, the kids are asleep. I guess the beds must be comfortable. Paul! How sweet! - How did you ever find time to do this? - Well, I'm the CO here. The CO has lots of privileges. So does the CO's wife. Paul, tell me something. It may be none of my business, but... - Was it necessary to be quite that harsh with Harry tonight? - The CO's wife has a beautiful neck. Tell me Lucy, look. We both have a big job, here. Mine's out there, and yours is right here in the house. So, I'll make a deal with you. I'll keep my nose out of your job if you'll keep your pretty little nose out of mine. Okay? - Paul... - You have a such wonderful nose, too. You know, sometimes kids just have to cry. All right. Tell the boys to get a plane ready. I meet you on the flight line. - Not again! Can't you eat one meal at home? - Sorry dear, this is important. It's always important. Where are you going? Lucy, I've told you before: Where I go and what I do outside this house is none of your business. - So, please don't ask any questions. - Sorry See you later. - P-K - A - A-U-L. Paul. - Paul! That's right. Ah! It's good? - Hi - Hi You're going to have to help me with the hors d'oeuvres. You'll serve the cold ones... Paul? What are you doing home so early? - Lucy, I don't know how to say this, but ah... - You're not going to be here tonight. I'm sorry, dear. - Where are you going? - I'll try to get back tonight. - Where are you going? - Lucy, if I wanted you to know, I'd have told you. Oh Paul, for heaven's sake! Stop taking yourself so seriously. - Why don't you stop all this cloak and dagger stuff? - Do you know something? Six years ago, today, almost to the minute, we were married. It been rough on you. It may get rougher. But try to stick it out. Will you sugar? - Try and get back early. - I will. - What's that? - Oh, I got a man to fix the pipes. I couldn't stand that knocking any longer. - That's using your head. Who'd you get? - One of those sanitary engineers. - Who? - One of those plumbers. You know, the fellas with the white suits. Poor man, I practically dragged him off the street. He was terribly sweet about it. Well, your hot water's all right now, Mrs.... - Tibbets. - Thank you very much, Mr. ah... - Oh, just ah, just call me Al. - Al. Thanks a lot, Al. - Well, how much do we owe you? - Oh, that's all right, Mrs. Tibbets. I should say it's not all right. How much do you fellas get an hour? A couple of dollars, I guess. - $2? You sure that's enough? - Oh, plenty. Alright, honey? Would you give Al $2? - Nice work, Al. - Oh, anytime, Col. Well, good day, Mrs. Tibbets. He's really terribly sweet. He's not very bright, is he? Yeah, well... - Hurry home, honey. - I will. And Lucy, next time anything goes wrong with the plumbing, you better let me fix it. $2 is a lot of money. - Alright - Bye Bye Gentlemen, as you know, for some time we've been wrestling with the problem of the actual exploding of the bomb. A very tricky problem it's been, indeed. For a while we assumed that the atomic bomb, like any conventional bomb, would be exploded on contact. Gentlemen, we know now, that for maximum efficiency, an atomic bomb must be exploded in the air. When we explode in space, we have to consider two elements: One, heat and radiation from the ball of fire at the center of the nuclear explosion. Two, the shock wave created by the explosion. As you can see, the shock wave is enormous. And the area of it, as it hits the earth's surface, is determined by the altitude at which the bomb is exploded. According to our most recent calculations, our bomb must be detonated at the precise altitude of 1,600ft. Such an explosion, should produce an area of about 3sq. mi. of total destruction. As to the immediate problem of triggering this bomb, I turn you over to CAPT Parsons. GEN Brent, Col. Tibbets, bearing in mind the principle of an atomic explosion, in its simplest terms, this is a mass of fissionable material. This is an additional mass of nuclear material. This is the trigger, on which we're working. When activated, this material is forcibly driven into the mass, setting off a chain reaction. Now, our specific problem is to achieve this merger within the shell of a falling bomb at exactly 1,600ft. above the target. We will perfect this trigger either electronically or barometrically. And Col. Tibbets, we intend to do the bulk of the work, and of course the testing at Wendover. That'll mean an added work load on the entire outfit. We'll handle it. - That's all I have, GEN - Thank you, Capt. Gentlemen, may I have a moment with Col. Tibbets? - Not a very pretty thought, is it? - No, sir. You know, for a moment there, I thought I caught you looking a little uncomfortable. I was. - That morning back at Colorado Springs I was under the impression that... - May I say something, GEN? I was flying B-17's, overseas. Before every mission I used to walk through the bomb bay on my way to the cockpit and I could... I could reach out and touch those bombs. And every time I knew that, even though our targets were industrial, there'd be people down there who'd get killed by those bombs and I... I felt uncomfortable. But I flew the airplanes, dropped the bombs. Sure, I felt uncomfortable just now. I wouldn?t think much of myself if I didn't. Neither would I, Paul. - Hi - Hi - Happy Anniversary. - Happy anniversary, sweetheart. They're pretty wonderful. - So are you. - They are wonderful. But you know, every time I look at them asleep, I get sad. - Terribly sad. - Why? Oh, I keep thinking of this war and how... somewhere, at this very moment, bombs are being dropped. Children like that are being killed. Lucy, don't ever say that again, not to me. Darling! What's wrong? - What did I say? - Look... - Paul, I... I didn't mean to... - Look! Let's clear up one little piece of morality right now. It's not bombs alone that are horrible, it's war. War is what's wrong, not just its weapons. - Paul, all I... - Sure, were in a war and innocent people are dying, and that's horrible. But lose this war to the gang we're fighting would be the most immoral thing we could do to those kids in there. Don't you ever forget it! - Here he comes. - Turn 'em boys. Okay, Tom, let her go. - Way off! - Missed by 2,000ft. Well, that's getting a little closer. Lucy! Lucy! Lucy! Where's Paul? - I don't know. Why? - Little Tommy Wilson fell off the swing. He's a bad concussion and he's hemorrhaging. They've got to fly him to Salt Lake City. And the hospital can't reach Paul to get permission to use the plane. Left orders not to be disturbed. Look, you take the kids. Don't worry, I'll find him. Jimmy! Jimmy, do you know where Col. Tibbets is? I have to see him right away. I?m sorry, Ma'am, he's in a restricted area and can't be disturbed. - Well but, can I call him? - We're to put no calls through except from Washington. - Oh, I see. What area is he in? - Area B. - May I borrow the Col.'s jeep? - I... I guess it's all right. Thanks, Jimmy. - Pass, ma'am? - I don't have one. I'm Mrs. Tibbets. - I have to see the Col. right away. It's very important. - Sorry, Mrs. Tibbets, you can't get by without a blue pass. - Can't you run in and tell him I'm here? - I can't leave this post. - Look, it's a matter of a child's life. I... - Sorry. - I'll take full the responsibility. - Mrs. Tibbets! - Your pass, ma'am. - I've got to see Col. Tibbets right away. - Please, your pass. - Look, I've got to see him. Now will you just knock on the door and tell him his wife is here and it's very important? - Sorry ma'am, this is a restricted area. - I can't help that, a child's life is in danger and I have to see my husband about it right away. Oh Paul, Tommy Wilson's had a bad accident. They needs a plane to take him to Salt Lake City. Could you do something about it right away? - Get on the phone. Set it up. Use my plane. - Right - Thank you, darling. - Sergeant! - Did you let in Mrs. Tibbets in here? - No, sir. I did , sir. - Well, it was my fault... - See that this man is taken to security headquarters immediately. - Cover his post. - Yes, sir. Paul, you can't blame that boy. It was my fault. I rushed right by him. Now listen, there are ways for that man to get in touch with me. He knows them as well as I do. Well, if he made a mistake, it was such a little one. You can't punish him for that. Lucy, go home; stay home; and keep your nose out of this base. Is it really necessary to play it this big, Paul? They told me not to bring you out here in the first place. Maybe they were right. Hey, Deuce! Take this to operations. Paul, I've just come from Washington. The Japanese have again turned down our ultimatum to surrender and slaughter in the Pacific continues. After long conferences with our allies, and many hour of soul-searching, President Truman has regretfully but definitely authorized the use of the atomic bomb against the Japanese empire. - I see. - Well, that puts it squarely in our laps. Pretty soon, now, that trigger is going to be perfected. The bomb will be completed and final flight plans will begin to take shape. Just about that time, somebody's going to have put all these pieces together and say we're ready. We're ready to try it. And that somebody, is going to have to be you, Paul. - Well, that's a pretty big order, sir. - You'll handle it. The code word is Blue Light. When you're ready, flash me that and I'll tell Hap Arnold. Ten minutes later, Silverplate is in operation. And from then on, there's no turning back. But, be sure we're ready, Paul, dead sure. Because when the time comes, you're going to have to make the decision... you, and you alone. And no one on this earth can help you. Yes, sir. Oh, by the way, this came through this morning. You've been approved for full COL. And there's a little favor you can do me. These have been kicking around in my drawers for years, now, always getting in the way. They're a little tarnished, but you can polish them up. I'd kinda like to think of those sitting on your shoulders, up there in that plane. Thank you, GEN, for everything. - Get out of here and get busy on Blue Light. - Yes, sir. - Hi, daddy. - Hi shorty. - I'm impossible. Ain't I? - Fine - Hello, peewee. Hi - Hello. Hey ask your mommy if she notices anything different on daddy's collar. Hey! - Well? - Very nice. - Look, I told you to keep that truck out of here. Now take it and put it in your room. - I will not! Don't you talk back to me. Put it in your room. Don't ever do it again or I'll take it away from you. It's all right. It's all right. It's okay. It's okay. Not even him, Paul. Not even a 3-year-old child. Can't even he make a mistake? Where does it come from; this need for perfection; this absolute intolerance of error. People are human, they make mistakes... but not around Paul Tibbets, no mistakes. Not in the air; not on the base; not in the home. Not even in the nursery. Well congratulations, you've got your Eagle now. When do you start bucking for GEN? I'm working tonight. I'll eat at the office. It's all right, sweetheart. Gentlemen, I'm just a guy who flies aeroplanes. The development; testing; and criteria for the success of the bomb is strictly your baby. But I've been the responsibility of committing this unit to action at the earliest possible time. You've demonstrated 9 successful drops. In my opinion, we're ready. I'm sorry, COL, but I don't agree. It's true that we've made a start and a good one. It's worked 9 times. But what about the 10th? Or the 15th? Or the 20th? What if it fails then? When you're over a Japanese city. - Why should it fail? - We don't say that it will, but... we can't guarantee that it won't. We've been charged with the responsibility of developing a bomb that has a negligible... that is... 1 to 10,000th chance of failing to fire. 9 drops can hardly be considered conclusive. - How much further testing will you require? - Hard to say. Possibly several months. A lot of men can die in several months. Well that's true COL, but an unsuccessful detonation would achieve nothing; save no lives. And waste 5 years of work; 20 billion dollars in research. - Well, what does this all add up to? - Simply this, without further and exhaustive tests, we cannot scientifically guarantee the success of Silverplate. If the unit must be brought into action, the responsibility must be completely and solely yours. I ah... I'll have to think about this. Thank you, gentlemen. Get me GEN Brent in Colorado Springs. I can't make this decision. It's too big. He'll have to make it himself. Take it easy, Paul. No one expects you to be superman. When the time comes, you're going to have to make a decision. you, and you alone. And no one on this earth can help you. Cancel that call. I don't know. See you later, Bill. Paul, your chicken's getting cold. - Stop doing that and eat your potatoes. - I don't like potatoes! Well, they're good for you, now you just eat them. I will not! - No nonsense, now, I don't want to hear another word out of you... - Can't we have one meal in peace? All right, all right, don't eat them. Paul... Paul, we... we just can't go on like this. What's bothering you? Nothing. - You're so stubborn. If you'd just let me help... - Lucy please, go back to the table. - But... but why won't you let me... - Lucy, will you just leave me alone! No, I won't! I'm not going to stand by and see you destroy yourself and me and the children. I don't care what this job is, you're not going to kill yourself. - Well, you're exhausted, Paul. You need a rest. - There's nothing I can do about it. Look, you need a change. Anything, just 24 hrs. away from this horrible place. And it's so ridiculously easy. - What are you talking about? - Cold Springs, they have cabins and a good trout stream. We can run up with Marge and Harry and be back Sunday. No one would ever have to know. - Where is this Cold Springs? - Outside Salt Lake. Oh darling, just for the weekend. - Marge says the trout are that big. You don't even have to know the spot... - When was Marge up there? Last week. Harry flew up to Salt Lake about something or other and he developed a little convenient carburetor trouble Marge drove up to meet him. She said they had the most... - What're you doing? - This is COL Tibbets get me MAJ Henderson. Paul, what're you doing? MAJ, I want Harry Bratton relieved of his duties and confined to base. You will take over as Director of Training until further notice. That's right. If it wasn't for you and Marge, I'd have him court-martialed. - Are you out of your mind? - Lucy, I've told you before... - You believe you can violate my confidence to do a thing like this to Harry? - For the last time, will you stay out of my business? It's my business too. And I'm beginning to understand a few things I couldn't face before. - That's enough. - Everything they say is true. You're not the man I married, not anymore. You're ambitious. You're cold, and unfeeling. - Lucy, listen to me. - You listen to me! I've had all I can take of this place. I can't live this nightmare any longer! You've killed every ounce of love or affection I ever felt for you, and I want out. You hear. I want you to get me out of here! All right. As soon as I can arrange transportation. I'll get you out of here. You and the children. - Sergeant. - Yes, sir? Set up my airplane for immediate take off. Notify GEN Brent I'll be in Colorado Springs in the morning. Right - What happened? - Engine failure on takeoff. - Anybody get out? - Pilot, co-pilot killed. - The GEN's in pretty bad shape. - The GEN? Not GEN Brent? Let's go. COL Tibbets - You may see him now. Just for a minute. - How is he? Alive. Remember, just for a minute. - Hello Paul. - I hear you ran into a little hard luck, sir. Oh, a couple of scratches, nothing to worry about. Well Paul, I know this isn't any social call. What's on your mind? I ah... I came to see you sir to ask... To tell you it's Blue Light, GEN. Good work, son. Wire Hap Arnold "Blue Light". Tell him old Brent's still got a pretty fair country average. - Yes sir. - Tibb, don't drop that thing in some old rice paddy. God bless you, sir. - Yeah? - Mrs. Tibbets to see you, MAJ. - Oh, show her in. - Yes, sir. Lucy! - Hello Bill. - Well this is a pleasant surprise! - Sit down. - Thank you. - Cigarette? - No thanks. - How are those kids of yours? - Oh, they're fine, just fine. - Bill, where's Paul? - Away - Where? - I think he'll be back this afternoon. I didn't ask you that. I know you didn't. Did you see him before he left? - Why? - Did he mention anything about us? - Should he have? - Did he? Why can't I ever get an answer around here? A simple answer to a simple question. - Lucy, what's wrong? - Paul and I just had a fight last night. We decided to split up. But I'm not leaving, not yet. Not until you give me the answer to a question, a big question. - What is it? - What's Paul doing here at Wendover? Why do you want to know? Because if... Because if it's just another job, then... then Paul's changed, and I can't live with him anymore. But if what he's doing is really important, there might be some reason for this act he's putting on. You've got to tell me, Bill. It means my home, my husband, my family. Lucy, I know it's tough. But be patient. It'll work itself out. - Then you won't help me? - I couldn't. All right, if I don't find out from you, I'll find out from somebody else. But mark my words: Before I break up my home, I'm going to find out what's going on, on this base. And you can put that on your security list. - Lucy, look... - Good afternoon, MAJ - Larry. - Yes, sir? I want a complete 105 on Mrs. Tibbets. - Mrs. Tibbets? - That's right, the COL's wife. - I want to be notified the moment COL Tibbets steps off that plane. - Yes, sir. Right MAJ Uanna wants to see you in his office right away, sir. He says it's important. Okay I just wanted you to know that I've taken the precaution of putting her under surveyance. - Do you really think Lucy's a security risk? - In this frame of mind, she could be. - What do you want me to do? - I see no alternative to sending her back to Washington. Immediately. Paul, another thing: now that we'll be shoving off in a couple of weeks, her leaving like this might cause speculation that the outfit's ready to move. I'd like it to get around that you and she have had a family squabble; and she took the kids and went home. It might be better if she thought that too. Think you can arrange it? How much? How much is she supposed to take? Why don't I just go home and kick her teeth in? That'd be easy. What do they want from me? Keep your mouth shut. Keep a secret. Lose your friends. Break up your family. What's next? How much can a man take? How much? She'll be out of here tonight. Call Washington. Clear a plane. - Get me A2 in Washington. - Yes, sir. - Hello Paul. - Hi - Have you had your lunch? I... I kept things warm. - I ate on the plane. Oh, Paul! I... I said such awful things last night! I was wrong, darling, so wrong. I don't want to leave. I want to be with you, Paul. All the time with you, every second that I can. I want you to take the children and go back to Washington. I've arranged for a plane. A plane? - When? - This afternoon. I'll help you pack. - Take care of your mummy and be a good boy, now. - Daddy, why aren't you coming? Daddy'll be home just as soon as he can. Goodbye - Well? - Take care of yourself, Paul. Yeah, I'll be seeing you. Come on, shorty. Hey! Ah, that's it fellas, Tinian. You can call it home, for a while. - Circuit A. - I read continuity. - Circuit B. - Circuit continues. - Excuse me, Dr. Ramsey. - Uh huh - Hello Bill. Any change in the weather? - No, that storm center is still moving towards the coast of Japan. - This just came in. - What is it? GEN LeMay wants to see you at Guam immediately. - Radio back I'll be there in an hour. - Right - See you later, Dr. Ramsey. - Right We've been given four alternate targets: Niigata, Kokura, Hiroshima, and Nagasaki Which city we bomb will be determined by weather reports received in flight. Briefly, the plan calls for three weather ships precede me by two hours. Two camera ships will accompany me and get a record if... well, if anything goes wrong. I'll bomb from 30,000ft and execute the steepest possible turn to head away from the blast area. The essence of the plan is simplicity: One bomb, one airplane. You mean to say you're going in there with a single unescorted B-29? With an atomic bomb at stake? Why, I'd surround your aeroplane with every fighter and B-29 we've got. - Hundreds of them. - Well, that sir, would alert all the Jap defenses. We're counting on surprise. Well, what if you're jumped by a flock of Jap zeroes? Our ship is stripped down: no armor, no turrets. We can fly and bomb at 31,000ft. A zero stalls out at 25,000. That's cutting it pretty fine COL. We think that speed, altitude, and surprise are a better defense than guns. The plan has been approved by GEN Spots. COL, you get yourself back to Tinian and stay at ready. You'll hear from me just as soon as I... Storm center moving off coast. Should clear by 07:00. Well, that's it. Tonight's your night. - Better get going, Paul. - Yes, sir. Our father, we pray thee that the end of the war may come soon. And that once more we may know peace on Earth. May the men who fly this night be kept safe in thy care. And may they be returned safely to us. We go forward, trusting in thee. Knowing that we are in thy care, now and forever. In the name of Jesus Christ, Amen Take off will be at 02:15. Go get some rest. - Bill, if ah... if anything happens, see that Lucy gets that. - You bet You got four hours. Try to get some sleep yourself. Dear mother, I'm writing you tonight because I've got something to say. You're the only one I can say it to. I've never said it to Lucy, and I never want to say it to my sons, I've never been able to say it to dad. Mom, I'm scared. I don't know why I'm scared. I suppose it could be that there's a good chance I'll be killed tomorrow. I've faced that before, often. It's never easy. But I'm not sure that's it. Maybe I'm scared of making a mistake. So many details, so much to keep in my head. Have I forgotten anything? Have I something undone? That one little slip that could ruin the mission. Maybe that's it, but I don't think so. Maybe I'm scared of the idea of dropping one bomb that can kill thousands of people. It's a hard thing to live with, but it's part of my job, and I've gotta do it. Just been looking for you COL. The boys are wondering what name you want to put on the plane. It's probably a little of all these things, mom. But I think mostly I'm more scared for my sons... for their world. I'm scared of what could happen if this thing we're unleashing tomorrow doesn't stop this war... and all others. I feel better now, mom. I'll be all right. - Sergeant. Did... did you just ask me something? - Well, yes sir. The name for the plane? Oh, just um... just name it "Enola Gay." "Enola Gay"? Is that someone's name, sir? Who is she, sir? One of your old girls? Yeah, one of my old girls. - Never even got off the runway. - 40,000 men and 300 planes on this island. - What if that happens to us? - You'd make quite a mess of things around here. It's not going to happen to us. We're taking off with the bomb unarmed. CAPT Parsons will arm it once we're in flight. This decision was made some time ago. - Well, gentlemen. Good luck. - Thanks, GEN. All right fellas. - PBS 8 - PBS 8 - Flaps 25° - Flaps 25° - High RPM - High RPM Checklist complete The camera ships are taking off now, COL. North Tinian Tower, this is Dimples 82, ready for takeoff. Dimples 82, from North Tinian Tower. - Clear for immediate takeoff on runway no.1. - Roger, Dimples 82. - Okay, Duze? - All set, COL. Looks like we're past the worst of the turbulence, CAPT. Any time, now. And good luck. Circuit A. unh... Circuit B. Pilot to crew, give me your attention. Up to this time you've only been told you what you needed to know to help accomplish this mission. You're now entitled to know the rest of the story. We're on our way to Japan to bomb one of four cities. Niigata, Kokura, Hiroshima, or Nagasaki Weather ships ahead of us are surveying conditions over those cities and will relay that information to us as we approach the coast of Japan. I know you're all wondering what that thing is back there in the bomb bay. Well, I'll tell you. It's an atomic bomb. When we release it today, you're going to see the biggest explosion in history. You've all been given dark goggles. But I don't want anybody I looking in the direction of the flash. Face away from it until we've made our turn. We know we're going to be hit by a shock wave. We don't know how hard. So stay on your toes. We've come a long way, fellas. Let's pray to God we finish the job right. That's all. Weather ships are coming in, sir. Niigata, 8/10 cloud cover, hazy Kokura, solid overcast Nagasaki, broken clouds, rain, visibility poor Hiroshima, clear, visibility unlimited It looks like Hiroshima draws the short straw, COL. Pilot to navigator, did you hear that, Dutch? Your primary target is Hiroshima. I'll split it down the middle for you, Tibb. - Tom, get a visual run if you can. - Visual bomb run, wilco. - Let's take her up, Duze. - Okay skipper Pilot to crew, we're approaching target area. Check your equipment and get ready. Navigator to pilot, we're over the IP and should hit the bomb release point at 09:15. Tibbets to camera ships: three minutes. - Tom, you see anything yet? - Negative There it is! - You've got it, Tom. - I got it. Plunger away. Doors open. All right everybody, get your dark goggles on. Remember, don't look at the flash. Get ready for the shock wave. 20 seconds 15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. God! Stand by! Here comes the shock wave. - Everybody okay back there? - Everything okay back here, COL. - Okay - Engines, okay Take it for a while, Bob. Pilot to radio operator. Take a strike report. Results good Results good - When did you sleep last, COL Tibbets? - Oh, I got a little sleep last night. - How long was the flight? - Approximately 14 hours - How big was the bomb? - Sorry, no comment - All right COL, we're ready for you on the air. - All right Who knew about the project? No comment - Did you feel any heat from the flash? - No COL Tibbets how do you feel personally about this bomb? Sorry, no comment Just a minute, COL. I represent a news service that's read by 16 million Americans. You've just dropped a bomb that's killed 80,000 people. My readers want to know how you feel about it. How do they feel about it? Lucy! Lucy! Lucy! Lucy, turn on the radio! It's Paul! He's on Guam. They just wiped out a Japanese city. It may end the war. May we have some pictures, Mrs. Tibbets? This is KWGA on Guam. You've been listening to COL Paul W. Tibbets Jr. who has just made history by leading a mission which dropped the first atomic bomb on Japan. Flying a B-29 named the "Enola Gay". COL Tibbets and his crew of 9, landed at Tinian at 3:15 P.M. where GEN Spots personally decorated COL Tibbets with the Distinguished Service Cross. For further details, we return you to New York. Come in, New York. - Did he tell you about the mission? - Did he tell you it was an atomic bomb? - How do you feel about his getting the DSC? - Is there any truth to the rumor that you and the COL are splitting up, Mrs. Tibbets? - Please, Mrs. Tibbets, just one picture. - One with the babies, please - Ad nauseam Paul... Paul
