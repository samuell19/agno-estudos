Ok, you guys win. Come on in, I'll sign up. Portland, Oregon. One of the nation's most beautiful cities. With Mt. Hood rising in the distance, majestic, serene, white with eternal snow. Portland is a city of wide streets, modern buildings, deriving much of its industry from the giant forests of the Northwest. The citizens of Portland attend many fine churches. Portland is a city of beautiful homes. In the soft climate, gardens grow lush and green throughout the year. Roses are everywhere in profusion. For years, Portland has been known as the City of Roses. Within easy distance of the city are settings of incomparable natural beauty, such as majestic Multnomah Falls. It is a family town. A good place to bring up children. And yet, like the muddy over flow of Bonneville Dam, crime and ugliness recently swept down on Portland. Like these rushing waters, vice threatened to inundate this jewel of a city. While the events you are about to see happened here, and they could happen again in your town. It certainly is a noisy thing, isn't it? Ah, just an amusement gadget, Mrs. Madison. - Customers go for 'em. - That's right. Clean, simple - fun. - Oh, Mr. Lennox, we know as well as you do that people gamble on them. Besides that, they're against the law. Oh, you're wrong Ma'am. Like I told you, there's no law botherin' the pinballs. Why, I could even put in a couple of slot machines here. I'd go for the jukebox. You'd get some money out of that. Look George, I know what you're up against. When you bought this place, I said to myself "Here's a guy going places, if he's - wise". - Well, we've made our plans to pay off the property. George is building some more cabins and we may get a franchise to put in some gas pumps. Gas pumps! Why this is a tavern. It's, it's kind of a landmark. You people can make plenty money here. The children are due home. Dow hatever you want to, George. George, put two, three of these in here, you'll average twenty bucks a day, a piece. Split's fifty-fifty. - Twenty a day for each machine? - Yep. Could be closer to fifty for you. Woodland Tavern's a hot place right now. All that construction going on down the road. Look, I'll leave two of 'em here for a month, see what they do. You want more to really lift you outta the red, just holler. - One. Let's just try one. - Hi, Pop. - Hi, Jimmy. - Hello, Father. Oh boy, pinball. Got a dime, Sis? Here you go. See, just an amusement gadget, a toy. Played that way but, you know what a crowd of adults do with - those things. - So people gamble. That's no skin off your nose. But look, one's no account. Let me put - in three. - One. You'll make this place look like a sideshow in a carnival. - Sit like I told ya. - Let me get to the phone. - I'll ask the boss. - You talkin' to the boss right now. Git that route list. You ain't got a chance to muscle in. The syndicate's got this - city tied up. - Ain't no syndicate no more. Now listen, them route lists or... Put one low in his guts Joe, for a starter. Don't. No, no, no, no. It's, it's in the file box. No, no, not there. On the steel files on the bench. The second drawer - from the bottom. - It better be. - Ok, let up on him. - Hmm. Must be fifty joints here. Quite a route you had. I see you got the real hot ones marked. Yeah, the good places are marked. If you want to run a collection route for a good outfit, come to Penthouse Suite 814. You knowwhat hotel. - Yes. - Boss, Spud. Say, a couple - of goons... - I know. Don't let 'em push ya around. Give 'em what they want. Give 'em. Say this kind just take. Real goons, like twenty - years ago. - Spud, you better go lay low somewhere. We're up against atough deal, a real big one. The biggest. Ok, You're in. - Well, what have you got? - That big route list from Spud Lennox. You have to rough him up a little? Eh, couple slaps. He was slow - comin' through. - You should'a beefed him. You balled things up in Seattle with that stuff, remember? Phil, there's only one way to run a bulldozer, that's to push - everything ahead of it. - Ha, ha, ha, ha. That's good Mr. Garnell. What we brung to this town is a bulldozer. Diesel - powered. - You've got the right driver in - the seat. - Alright, now that you gentlemen have had your joke, maybe we can talk business. Come on, Phil. We didn't come to Portland for no funeral. Don't be so sure about that. - What are these symbols in red? - Them letters? The "A's" is joints in good locations. "B's" good, but not up to capacity and - so on. - Yeah, three, four, five of 'em - marked "A." - I cased 'em all and one joint towards the river, but in close enough, the Woodland Tavern. Hey, Woodland Tavern, that's the joint the real estate people - were talkin' about. - I know. Alright, put the pressure on these five. I think most of the others'll fall in - line when they see what's up. - Is the somethin' special 'bout - the Woodland joint? - Yes, I got some big plans for that spot. Oh Joe, I haven't had a chance to talk to you since we left up - north. - Yeah, Mr. Jackman. You stay close to Larry and I want to warn you about the women. Oh that's all over, Mr. Jackman. Well, I put in a tough stretch - up there. - I mean girls. As soon as we get going here, there'll be plenty of women, you can do as like with them. But if you make a slip like you did in Washington, it won't be the pen and an easy parole. I tell ya Mr. Jackman, you don't have to worry. I talked to him boss. He's got the cure. From now on, only ripe old dollys for Joe. Say sixty or better. I just wanna make it plain, that's all. We may never need you for a chopper in this set up Joe, but you're around in case we do. But we don't want a foul up. - I tell you Mr. Jackman... - Alright now, let's get going. Put the pressure on these five. Larry, you'll move in to close the deals and report here every day. Check, with a little extra pressure on the Woodland Tavern joint. - Guy's a hold-out, huh? - Six days. Doesn't he know everybody else is lined up? He don't know from nothin' yet. Wait. Look. Gives me an idea. Like what worked in New York. - Hi, Pop. - Good morning, Jimbo. - Bye, Daddy. - Bye. - Can I drive? - Ok. I'll drop Jimmy and Ruth by the school and I'll go on to the bank. Go to Cornett Amusement Company and see if you can get a line on Lennox. Snap out of it, you. Wake up, that's jailbait. And you know all about jailbait, Joe my boy. Don't have any more arguments with the delivery men. Promise. Jammed. - You back again? - That's right, Mr. Madison. - You ready to sign? - I told you before, I can hang - on for a year, closed tight. - You'll be closed alright. This is the last chance to change your mind. You guys are outta date. You belong in Chicago, twenty years ago. Get outta here, all of ya. Stay back from him Joe, he's a wise guy. Come on, come on, take it away from me. Huh? Ok chump, sit down. - So we gotta get rough. - Just what is your racket? Easy, you kick these machines out and put ours in. Then we open a joint all out. Everything. Oh no, you shut me down, I'll stay shut. With guys like you, we usually make it a beef job. That means hospital. But this time we're gonna go scientific. - Burns, don't it? - Suppose it goes in my eyes, - you monster. - Alright, sit down. No, not in your eyes, buddy. That little daughter of yours, how old is she? About eighteen I bet, huh? - No, no you wouldn't. You... - Don't gamble on it, mister. You want that little girl of yours to get a face lift? Or you'll go on along the way we tell ya. Alright, spell it out. All this trouble because we wanna make you a rich guy. It's still 50/50, but we go all out. We'll make the split you've been gettin' look like peanuts. - Mom, can I bring my date in? - You know better than to ask - that, Ruth. - But Mother, I look eighteen and Benny looks at least 21. Well, almost. - Who on earth is Benny? - My date. Benny Morrison, the jerk. Keep him out, Mom, juvenile. Brat. Honestly Mother, how square can you get? You listen to me. Jimmy, you have homework to do. Ruth, until you are 18 and your date is 21, you may not dance - in here. Go on, both of you. - Ok. Squares. Vickie, take over for me please. Ruth, if you'd just take care of your clothes. Oh Mom, don't lecture. - Ok? - Yes, dear. It's not 11:00 yet. You've got lots of time. Oh, there he is. Brat. Can you drop me off at the park Sis, or do you think Napolean - would object? - Mom, I just can't stand his - smart aleck cracks. - He's just a typical brother. And you tell Benny to drive carefully in this Saturday - afternoon traffic. - Ok, Mom. Bye, bye. - Bye, darling. - Bye, Daddy. - Where's Ruth going? - Into town with that boy, Benny. They're going to a matinee and then Benny's house for dinner. What business is his father in? Well George, he's a deacon in the local church. Oh, any breakfast or is it lunch time? George, what's happening to us? We're making money. Already put a dent in what we owe. Is money all that matters? George, you act like you did when you first got out of the army. Strong, tense, nervous. That wild, hard look's in your eyes again. Clara, if you'll do what I've been asking you to do for weeks, I can pull out of this my own way. No, I'm, I'm not going to leave you here in trouble. We've always pulled together. All of us. We'll do it again if you let us. - Yes, but Ruth... - What about Ruth? Hmmph, young squirt she's been running around with has been making snide remarks about us operating wide open. She's at an age to take that kind of thing very seriously. Maybe you ought to take her home to your mother for a while. It's not only Ruth, it's all of us. How long are you going to allow two or three hoodlums to dictate how you can run your - business? - It's not a simple as that, Clara. I think I found a solution. - What? - The police are coming to the - tavern tonight. - Police. That's right. I finally got throught to a decent person there, a Captain Vincent. He'sraiding the tavern, padlocking it and arresting customers at 10:30 tonight. What did the... that'll only cause more embarrassment. But don't you see Clara, if the law shuts us down then it's off - my back. - Well then, can we get out of - here and go home, can we? - Clara. - Can we? - Did you ever know me to back - out on a fight? - This is different, this is something, this is something ugly and sinister. Ok, I'm stubborn. But I'm not going to lose every dime we've - saved. - I'm scared George. Honey, we'll get outta this mess and we'll start again. Clean. - Routine check. - Kind of early, aren't you? - What's up, makin' wise? - No, I run a wide open joint here. Warms up about 10:00. Gambling, after hours liquor. Can't you see the slot machines? - No dames? - We haven't got around to that - yet. Give us time. - Well when you line up a few, let us know, huh? We'll be back. Oh, oh, jackpot, jackpot. Oh, I got the jackpot. Oh, bring it here. Put 'em in here. I ain't sayin' one word outta turn. I'm only asking you one question. Where can I find the head guy of the sydicate you used to work for? I, I ain't even goin' up town. Now or ever. I'm not asking you to. Give me his address, I'll go see him. - You know his name? - I got that alright but nobody - knows where he is. - Well, give me my little black book. It's in my coat pocket. That's right. It's a little bitty hotel on the outside of town. There, there look. Edgerly Arms. Edgerly Arms. Yeah, I suppose they would call my business a racket. But if I hadn't run it, somebody else would. Well, we never took the lid off this town in fifteen years. You mean no slots, no open gambling. I mean no open prostitution, no bootlegging, no dope ring. No cover up for criminals on the lamb. No organized illegal surgery. But believe me, those are the things that Portland's in for now. Well George, if you still want to fight this mob, telephone me. I'll give you the name of the man to see. Well, you should talk. You lay down and play dead the minute - these hoods move in. - Ha, ha. Be as bitter as you like, my boy. But, I'm old and I got more than one bullet hole in my hide. But there are some people who intend to fight this thing. And they need help from someone who already has an in with this mob and can stay in. Oh no, I just want to get this mob off my back. Stay here, Joe. We got a lot of collection money. I'm gonna ask our boss for an armored truck on this route. We're armored. What more do you want? - None of your business. - It's just, you haven't been to church for a long time. You know how I feel about things like - that. - I don't want to talk about it. - Ok, ok, we won't talk about it. - I don't care what your dad - says. He's just a snob. - So he's a snob. So maybe he's wrong about you. He's not wrong about your father and this place. Let your dad keep his nose out of my dad's business. Oh come on, let's not quarrel. We've got our own lives to live. Our parents are squares. This is only three of the machines. - Bring the rest in the office. - Check. Oh hey, George, the big shots want to see you. What do you mean? The big boys, you know the bosses. The big boys. Penthouse Suite 814. - What do I say, Larry sent me? - Aw no, this ain't no joint. It's headquarters, just like in the army when a general sends - for ya. - Suppose I'm due for a medal. Could be. You got the hottest spot on my whole route now we finally got you goin'. First heard that song at the Calypso Club. Hey, there's a crazy place for ya. I know the man who runs it. He'd let us in. It's wide open and I mean wide open. You know my limit's 10:30. My, I've never been to a place like that. Wow, my dad would have our heads. Stop playin' it so square, Ruth. You know you've been around. The place your dad runs. Come on, we can go down to the Calypso Club and I know where I can get a room. You know you've been around. Come on, we're goin' out in the country. Oh, no we're not! That guy botherin' you, baby? - No! Who are you? - Oh, I don't mean no harm. I'm just a friend. Yeah, that's it, a friend, a friend. Uh, uh. No runnin'. Let me go. Don't kill him or there'll be big trouble. The young dollys again, huh? Git him outta here. It's alright, Ruth. - Did he harm her? - No, no not that way. - Thank God. - This is the finish. Take us - away from here. - Take it easy, Clara. You take it easy. Don't you realize what almost happened to - Ruth? - Now wait a minute honey, - please. - We're getting out of here. Oh, this rotten business is going to make all of us rotten. It's changed you already, George. Take the kids and go home to your mother for a while. For a while, no no, no. You're coming with us. Don't you see yet what these people are, what they do? - That one was just a rabid dog. - Yeah well, others are worse. - And still you'd stay? - Yes. Oh George, you've lost your mind. I want you to take the kids and go. I'm mad, honey. This is one thing I'm gonna see through, right to the end. Thought I'd better phone you right away, Mr. Carmody. - Where is he? - In the car. - I had to tie him up. - Larry, the law mixed up in it? Not as far as I know. I know dolly's father liked to kill him. It's too bad he didn't. I told Phil we shouldn't keep this guy here. He's trouble with a capital T. Them hopheads are nuthin' to what ails him. I figured you'd want to handle it yourself, boss. Or one of those things, somebody could file a complaint. Be like him to squeal his head off to the newspapers. There's a thousand for ya in the morning, Larry. Come up to the hotel. A lonely ho/whore routine? Don't leave any tags on his clothes. - Hello, Benny. - Hi, Mrs. Madison. You folks moving? No, no. We're just going on a trip to visit the children's grandmother. Come on, Benny. Come on, Benny. Come on, Benny. Benny, come on. Oh, you're ok. Come here, Benny. That's a good Benny. - Hey, what's this Benny bit? - Oh, just a name. Only a name. Kinda cute, ain't it? - Cute name for a rat. - Ha. - Ruth. - He just named that old rat to - tease me. - Well, I guess it was kind of - appropriate. - No it wasn't. Not after I read your letter. Takes courage to apologize like that. Do you mean we can be friends again? Would you wear my pin again? Ruthie, I, I promise, I swear I'll never again... Shhh, shhh, shhh. Let's not talk about it. You made it clear in your letter how badly you felt. Let's just forget it ever happened. Oh Ruthie, you're wonderful. But what about that bit, your mom - said you're going away? - All about Dad. But it will - just be for a little while. - What about the fraternity - dance? - Oh, I forgot all about that. If you're gonna go to college here, you wanna meet some of the crowd. They'll all be at the dance. I tell you what, if Mother doesn't want to come back by then, I will. Dad will be here. I'll come back the day of the - dance. - Great. Will you write me? Sure. Ruthie. Get your things down to the car, honey. We're almost ready to leave. Benny. - Yes. - I don't want to give my name unless I'm certain your phone isn't tapped, Sir. - Not this telephone, go ahead. - This is George Madison. I know - mine's tapped at the Tavern. - Speak freely, my boy. You made up your mind to lineup on the right side? First, I want to make certain that my family gets some protection. I'm sending them to Corvallis. Very easy. You have my assurance. Then I want to go along with you. I intend to hit back. Memorize this name, Alfred Grey. Don't make a note of it. You'll find him at the Labor Temple. - Mr. Madison? - Right. Come in, won't you? Oh, you know Captain Vincent. Yeah, I know him. It's been nice meeting his pals. Just a minute, George. Listen to an explanation. - Yeah? - The tip off went right out from the District Court building like I knew it would. Look Mr. Madison, Captain Vincent represents the decent element on the police force or he wouldn't be here. At least stick around, get wise dup. My name is Bromley. Ted Carl, reporter. Captain Vincent you already. Alfred Grey is with the union. Now uh, sit down. Mr. Grey will conduct the seance. First, let me tell you something that Al Grey won't. He represents the rank and file of trade unionism. He's just as anxious to kick out the rats and the racketeers as we are. Don't make a speech, Carl. I think he's beginning to understand. Ok, I'll go along so far. Why was I steered in here? Because we found that certain people have more that just a - casual interest in your tavern. - You mean uh, Jackman and his gang? They're underworld hoods. They were sent here by men who have tremendous power. Put it this way, trade unionism to Al Grey and the hundreds of thousands of people like him, is aimed at improving every working man's position. Very few make a racket out of it for their own - personal gain. - Ok, deal me a hand. It's been impossible for us toplant anyone on Jackman or Garnell, where important conversations could be picked up. Now, if you play your hand right you could go in with this. It's a tape recorder. You wear it under your arm. Any tape recordings you get will go to the Grand Jury. You better take some time and think this over carefully, George. If they catch you with that thing, you're dead. - I'm not buying anything yet. - If you could get just one incriminating conversation, that would be invaluable evidence. Just record what they say they're doing with your tavern. That would be enough. If I go along, it will be for the full ride. And I mean for the full ride. Less than that, I don't play. You wanna sweat through another picket line? So far, all you've given me is a lot of double talk. I'm operating the tavern wide open, you're getting your cut. If there's any change, I want in. All the way. Go easy, Phil. This guy acts too cocky. We got all the aces, not you. Alright, I'll tell you what we have in mind. You have a few cabins. We want twenty more. There isn't enough tourist trade for that. Look, quit playing the patsy, will you? I can see right through you. You're wise, cagey and tough. The rest is just an - act. - You mean you want me to open the place all out to "b" girls, gambling? That's better. Now you're talking a language we both understand. Alright, now this is it. Woodland Tavern is secluded but it's still close enough to town. We're buying up the fifty acres alll around you. We're gonna put in more machines. The liquor and the gambling. Plenty of good looking models for shills. "B" girls by the dozen. - You guys crazy? - This is gonna be the biggest operation in the country. Bigger than Vegas. Do you wanna sell outright or do you wanna ride for your cut? If you ride, you'll run the shill. I'll ride for the big take. It's gonna take a while to do the building and the remodeling. Meanwhile, you won't be getting any money. Alright, put me onto something that'll pay off in the mean time. Hey, wait a minute. This guy come to that awful quick. This is a wiseguy Phil, I tell ya. That's the kind we need. We've got enough morons. Here, take this key. I want you to get your feet wet. That's a key to a lock box at the railway station. I want you to go down there and pick up a package and bring it here. When? Tonight. You'll come back in cab #30. It'll be waiting at the station for you. And good luck on your first assignment. Cab. It's a pinch buddy. Narcotics. There must be a couple of pounds of this stuff in here. Yeah, box 043. Check it, will ya? I'll hold on. Well, brief me. Did you get me out of bed to come down here and - watch you hold a telephone? - George Madison's making a phony pick up from a railroad lock box. Holy smoke, he's framed. Well come on, let's get down there. Hold your horses. I got Reynolds the Center dick checking to see - if he did make the pick up. - From my door, I hope he didn't. Yeah, I'm still here. Oh, you sure you got the number right, 043? Yeah. Ok, thanks a lot, Reynolds. Well, he did. Box is open, empty. You stay here in case he gets word through. - Where you goin'? - To the one place he's most likely to turn up next, City Morgue. All right. Nothing there. No news all night. Ah, I checked the morgue again, blank. There's nothing on the arrest blotter down at the Narcotics Squad. Because he could have fooled us. But if he did, he also fooled a very shrewd man before he ever - came here. - No, no. I'll swear George Madison was on the level with us. - Mama, the smelling salts. - He doesn't even look ruffled. Boy, are we glad to see you. What happened? I'm in. Now here's some sample dialog for a starter. You guys look like you've seen a ghost. We have. But let that pass. Well what happened after you picked - up the package? - Well, I was arrested. Two private detectives, I think. They made out a charge, narcotics possession. Jackman kept the charge sheet so I am now an inside member of Jackman/Garnell Incorporated. Well, they certainly double crossed themselves this time. You've got Jackman's voice on the tape telling you to pick up that package. - Or have you? - That's right, play it. You've done us a great service, George. This will be important evidence when we get before the Grand Jury. What's the matter? You afraid you'll run out of tapes? - I've just started. - After last night, you are hard - to satisfy. - As long as this thing runs, I'm going to record every voice I can get. They've assigned me to a collection route with a 50/50 split. And it's just to keep me happy until they get everything - going. - Be careful, George. Looks a little rough. The office's are ok. Your office is upstairs. This is going to be an all-out operation. Offices for each department. Records of money taken in and money spent. Records, that's a bad word in the rackets. I like you, George. You're direct and factual. But there is something you don't fully grasp. - At least I'm reaching. - And that is, how big we are. There's no danger of our recordsbeing raided. We have unlimited funds for protection. We intendto control everything, right up - to the top. - You mean politically? That and anything else you can name. All the way up. So we keep books and records. We'll have branch offices in every town in this state. And we have plans set for California, too. Come on, I'll show you the rest of the layout. You tell 'em there was only 3 cases of whiskey in that last - truck. I want twenty. - Come again. Sorry Bud, I'm a little deaf. Got slugged in stir one - time. - Liquor, they ain't deliverin' enough. Tell 'em I want twenty. Get it, twenty. Sure, I got that alright. Pearl's got a message for ya. See her 'fore you leave. - Hi, honey. - Where's Pearl? Pearl? You don't want her. Won't I do? Come on. Come on over here and have a drink with me. I told you to lay off the liquor. Now go on, get upstairs. Ah, you're just jealous, cause I'm younger than you. Go on, beat it. Bud tells me you're a little hard of hearin'. - A bit. - How come you never told me that? Well, you ain't gonna miss much in this joint. Got a message for ya, to call Jackman as soon as you got in. These dames around here'd call long distance to China if I didn't keep it locked. You hearme alright, Mister? - I ain't missin' much. - I'm busy. Shut the door on the phone when you're through, will ya? It'll lock. - It's me, George. - You about finished with the - mill route, George? - One more call. I want you to go out to the airport and meet a Mrs. Stoneway on flight 62 from Seattle. Standat the passenger entrance. She'll walk up to you. The limousine driver knows where - she's to go. You got it? - Uh, check. Mrs. Stoneway, - airport. - Annie Stoneway coming to town? - Yeah, yeah. Do you know her? - Boy, do I. She's the "Great Annie". B-girls, model agencies. Annie's the biggest and best organizer in the country. Hey, things are really popping when they send for her. Oh, my name's Iris. Let me, I'm the motherly type. There, that's better. - Seen Pearl? - Uh, she just left. Well, so long. See you around. Oh uh, give my best to Annie Stoneway. Tell her Iris is ready and willing. United Airlines Mainliner Service, Flight 408, now arriving from Seattle, Tacoma. Are you looking for Mrs. Stoneway, young man? - Yes Ma'am. - Is there no one else on the - reception committee? - I'm afraid not except the - driver of the car. - Well, at least they had the decency to send a chauffeur and a young man, a greeter who doesn't look too much like a thug. I have no bags but this. Who's taking us? I was expecting someone, well, different. What's the matter, disappointed? No, no, kinda pleased. You see young man, when I am connected with an operation, it has to be of the highest cards. I'm sure of that Mrs. Stoneway. In fact, I use a strict card index system with my escort bureaus. Only those who are known to me will get a date. I'm very proud of my method. When I was in Portland before, I worked with some of the biggest people in the city. - I'm sure you did. - And my models and escorts are all ladies. No dipsos, no hop heads. When I provide a gentleman with a date, he can take her into any class of society. - Why are we stopping here? - That's one of the joints they - wanted me to show you. - Oh, oh, well this will do. - Are there others? - Yeah, 3 or 4 more. You wanna - see 'em? - No, take me to the hotel. Nice neighborhood, too. You know I require a large house where I can train my young ladies inculture and social graces. You're really an expert, Mrs. Stoneway. Well, the organization backing me and you wouldn't put up with amateurs, my boy. When I'm settled, I'll make Jackman throw a party for us all. The boy's doing alright. He gets to meet the dolls. Well, there's more tape. He may still be on it. That's it. She didn't name names. I'll keep sending tape by messenger. Too dangerous to come there with it. Tonight I'm trying to get a voice direct - from Seattle. - If he can pull that off... So you're opening the city wide in spite of what I said. Wide is right. Don't get the idea that Portland is anything special. We got the dough and we got the power and we use them - both in plenty of towns. - Those two hoodlums you sent up here, Jackman and Garnell, are riding for a big fall. - Is that a threat? - Read the cards as they're dealt. Listen you, if anything happens to my boys down there, you'll find yourself in a cast iron coffin, on the bottom of the Columbia River. Hello. Oh yes, operator, please. - Hello, Clara, darling. - George, I'm so glad you called I've been trying to call you all day. How are you? What's been - happening? - Everything is fine. We'll soon have the tavern back, just the way you want it. Just a moment. Call you back, Can't talk now. No. George, I'll call you at thetavern. I'm not there. Ruth left with some friends. She was expecting to meet you at the tavern. George? - I hope you've got a drink. - As a matter of fact, I have - and I just moved in yesterday. - Not even a suite of rooms? Hey, for a guy Jackman says is ready for the big league, you live like a bum. I knew I was going to like you. Come on, get ready. You're going to the party, aren't you? - What? - Oh, I'm sorry, the party to welcome Annie Stoneway. - What's wrong, Mom? - Go get your jacket and we'll leave a note for Grandma and tell her that we've gone. Where to, Mom? Where are wegoing? To Portland. Buy me a drink, George. Sure. Hey, you two got together. Iris is one of my favorites but she would stay in Portland. Let's not rehash it now, Annie. I didn't want that old biddy rehashing my life history. She's good at that. - Jackman get back in? - No he hasn't. By the way, I've got the nicest little girl I'd like you to meet. Oh, I already got me a girl I'm interested in. You're not getting jealous are you, Tom? - Hello, Tom. - Hello, Phil. Where's Annie, I want to pay my respects? Never mind Annie. Come to the bedroom with me and pay your respects first to somebody else. What's on your mind? I'm the guy who always balls things up, huh? I'm the big bungler. Come on Phil. You gotta get aload of this. - Well, what's this all about? - You... Hello Iris. Saw you dancing with our new man. You dance like a - dream. - Oh, she's a dream alright. - Wake him up, honey. - Well, the guy's certainly - loaded. - Who's loaded. What are you - talking about? - Georgey Porgy, puddin' and pie ain't anymore deaf than you and I. What are you two trying to do, rib me? No, no, no. I sic'd her onto this square John you're so sold on. Honey, will you tell him but no nursery rhymes. Well, I kind of like him. Uh, he's the bashful type. Ooh, bashful. Alright, I'll tell him. Look, the word is out along this guy's route he's kinda hard of hearing, see. He's gotta wear a kind of a gadget. Now... Will you shut up? I sic Iris onto him after she tells me she's seen him hunched over a telephone at Pearl's Joint holding onto this gadget but he don't wear no ear pieces. - What sort of thing was it? - About like this. I didn't see it good. But I've been pushing my shoulder against it all evening. He's the loving kind. I'd a seen it good in the hotel room but he wouldn't let me take his shirt off. - You're nothing but a tramp. - You made me what I am today. Alright, quit the clowning, Iris. Get out of here, will ya. Thank you for the bonus, Sir. Send two men up to this hotel room right away. Search everything. They're looking forspools or recording tape. He's a wiseguy, just like I toldya, huh? He's shootin' for a genuine million dollar piece ofblackmail. Send somebody down to that Woodland Tavern, look around everywhere. Gonna talk anymore about who bungles what? Fine, now get going Tom. Let's do that guy in here and you comeafter him. Can you beat it Patsy, a minute? Uh, Jackman got some business hewants to talk over with you - right now. - Party's just warming up. Party'll wait. Come on. Alright, open up. I want to see it. Hey, hey. Oh! Alright, grab him. Alright, take his coat off. Put him in this chair. Wiseguy, I'd like to drop a slugin him right now. - Now, where are the tapes? - In there. You're a liar. This tape hasn't run an inch. Come on, where are they? What have you done with them? - Go to hell. - Alright, we'll get all the information we want outta ya. Take him down to the warehouse. - Get up. - Palmer, you check the tavern for recording tape. Take him out the back way. Right, come on. Get outta here. No, you stay here. Keep an eye on the party. I'll handle this. The warehouse is right on the tracks. Apparently, they kept a lot of records, probably somefor blackmail. Anyhow, everything is moved to the warehouse. Place is well guarded but if you could figure some way to get at those files, I'd say my job was done and yours too. - You catch all of it? - Enough. With those files we could be in front of the grand jury tomorrow. You're askin' for a fight with aware house full of goons? I hope you got the originals in a safe place. - In the vault. - Good. I've asked 15 or 20 key men to come here. They're from all over the state. Officials of - various levels. - Well, we'll stick around. When I get through talking to them and playing these tapes I think I can show you the way to wrap everything up. - You think we're that close? - I'll answer that after I talk to the men who are coming here. We chase down every rat hole in this city for a year, but in a few months, this fellow Madison puts the cap on the bottle. Come in. Well hi fellas, glad you could make it. Pull up a chair, sit down. Looks like it's gonna be crowded if everybody shows up. Hello Mrs. Morrison, this is Ruth again. Has Benny come in yet? Yes, I know the dance is tomorrow night but I got a ride from Corvallis so I came in a day early. Uh, yes. Would you have him call me as soon as he gets in? Thank you. Hold it, baby. - Ah, ah, ah, ah, oh, oh, oh. - Let me go. - Hold on. - Let me go. Take it easy now, the little girl's scared to death of ya. Look honey, we don't want any trouble, no rough stuff. All we want is to do is talk to you. Ok? Where's my father? What have youdone with him? Well, there's been a little change. He's got an office - downtown now. - I don't believe you. I don't - believe you. - Easy now, easy. We wouldn't hurt you. Why I've got a kid of my own. - Then you let me go. - Baby, your Daddy hid some little spools of tape around here somewhere. You know where - they are? Huh? - I don't know what you're - talking about. I've been away. - Uh, ok, alright. You show us where he keeps things then. You know like uh, stuff he don't don't want nobody to find easy, like uh, insurance papers, stuff like that. Huh, ok, huh? Come on, come on now, be a good girl. Where, where we gonna find it? Huh, where, huh? You'll either talk or you'll end up out there under a train. Now make up your mind. I told ya, I intended to muscle in. Blackmail you for a big take. - I still do. - That figures Phil. Shut up. Where have you hidden the tapes? - Say when, Boss. - Come on, I asked you where - you've hidden the tapes. - Phone, Phil. Out at the tavern, I had Drummer and one of the boys searchin' the joint. The little dolly showed up. - Where is she now? - I told him to get her right - down here fast. - Good. He's got the nerves of a block of concrete. I believe he'd let us blind him. That's what I was figuring. You can relax a bit. Get him a drink of water. - Ruth, Ruthie. - She's been here. What's the number? Benny Morrison's number? Apparently, they kept a lot of records. Probably some for blackmail. Anyhow, everything is moved to the warehouse. Place is well guarded but if you could figure some way to get at those files, I'd say my job was done. Well, now you've heard the evidence. You've also heard where the final proof, the records of these underworld operations are kept and heavily guarded. What are we waitin' for? Let's go. Let me go, you, you... Where's my father? - I told you honey, he's here. - Hold it a second. - Jackman, you lousy, vicious... - Fellas! Now bring here into the light. The minute they do, Larry performs a function he's famous for. - Start her forward slowly boys. - What are they doing? The minute she hits the light, push her forward and step back quickly. Stop it, stop it. I'll give you anything you want. Daddy, Daddy. Ok, talk. But remember, we've still got the girl and Larry's - still got the bottle. - Oh, I'll show ya, the tapes - are buried. - Where? - In the tavern. - Cut him loose. Alright, get those handcuffs on him. - Run. Run. - Where'd he go? Don't shoot him. I want his girl first. We don'twant any bullet holes in him when he goes to the railroad tracks. They got loose. Get in there, I'll watch the door. Daddy. Daddy. - Did you see the girl? - She's hiding. Dig her outta those crates. Hey! Let's go. - Ruthie. Ruthie. - Mama, Mama. It's alright honey, I'ts alright, it's alright. - Oh. - Let's sit down. We're not going to go away. Ruthie. The McCellan Commitee of the United States Senate opened an investigation of vice and crime in Portland and the Portland Expose sparked a nation wide inquiry into the affairs of the cynical men who had abused every trust placed in them by honest rank and file members of the unions. The rushing torrent of vice receded from the City of Roses. People breathed freely again. Portland, still a good place to rear children. The City of Roses, with Mt. Hood rising against the distant sky, white and serene beneath this blanket of everlasting snow.
