MAN 1: Got a pebble in my shoe and I can't seem... MAN 2: Behind that bush... MAN 3: I'm sorry for the short delay. Our driver has it all fixed. And we'll be on our way. WOMAN: You've made this trip so enjoyable. MAN 3: Well, it'll get better, it'll get better. WOMAN: Do you think we could open a window? It's awfully stuffy in here. Oh, you can open 'em, close 'em, whatever you like. -Excuse me. -Yes, ma'am? I get woozy on the back of the bus. I'd like to change my seat. Sure, sure, go ahead. -Watch your step. -Move along. Do you think we'll see any Jerusalem artichokes? You've been roaming around. We can't wander off like that. Now, there are snakes and all sorts of animals, Oh, thank you, Sister, thank you. Yes. -I can feel... -Oh, Sister Mary Rose. Yes, Sister Rose Mary. Yes. Uh-huh. Thank you. Where, where did I go wrong? All right, now everybody, here we go again, finally. I realize that it's warm, it will cool off when, Ah! Somebody's knocking on the door. . Stop the bus! Stop the bus! Stop the bus! (TIRES SCREECH) -Oh! -Watch your step, there. It's the most interesting thing that's happened on the trip so far. Okay, now that we have a little time before our next stop, I'd like to welcome you to Pilgrimage Tours, No-Frills Israel. Where Moses led his people to the Promised Land and Christ grew into manhood. Since we'll be spending 15 days together here in the Holy Land, I'd like to take this time to get better acquainted. I'd like to start by introducing our driver, Mohammed. I'm living in, Mohammed! (EXCLAIMING) I'd like all of you to turn to the person next to you, shake their hand, and say to that person, "Hello, neighbor." -Hello... -Hi, I'm Zoey from Los Angeles. -Oh. Los Angeles, eh? -Yes. Yeah, my girlfriend was from Los Angeles. Gosh she put me through hell. Lisa and I were living together at the time you know. Everything had always been fantastic sexually and suddenly, Suddenly everything started changing. You know, she started changing. Things weren't just the same anymore, you know. Turned out there was another man in her life. Actually, there was another three men in her life. Now, starting here in the front row, I'd like each of you to say your name and tell us a little something about yourself. I'm Arthur Burns from Miami Beach, Florida, and I've come to plant this fig tree in honor of my grandmother and grandfather. Now there's a fine young man. Uh, I'm Edgar Grant. I have faith that the healing waters at Bethesda will cure my blindness. -No way, Edgar. -That's not very nice, you know. We're the Rutherford's. Ralph, and my lovely wife Florence. We're celebrating our 50th wedding anniversary. Well, I'd say that deserves a round of applause. Huh? What are you doing here? Every time a relationship of mine breaks up, I take a vacation somewhere. You must have been around the world several times. Listen, uh, maybe we should start all over again. Uh, I'm Harvey, Harvey Orkin. I'm Professor of Language Studies. Hmm. City College, New York, New York. Oh. Oh, God, I had to, I had to get out. I had to have a change of scenery. Just to take my mind off that tramp Lisa. God, I, I had to get out. I had to, I had to go somewhere. But this isn't the place I'm supposed to be in. I mean, look at me, I'm not even dressed for, for the Holy Land. You back there, why don't you stand and, and share your story with all of us. Because of some stupid mix up with the travel agency, Right now there's a Rabbi Orkin living up in Paris while I'm stuck on the stupid tour of the Holy Land! Okay. Well, our next stop will be the Mount of Temptation, where Christ fasted for 40 days and 40 nights. So we're going to have lunch there, huh. Oh, aren't we having fun now? Be the third wise man. Two dollars and you can be the third wise man. Only two dollars! Careful now, watch your step and figs. All right, careful brother. Oh, thank you. -We really hit it off on the bus, didn't' we? -Uh-huh. Listen, I'm sorry if I embarrassed you, but I'm, I'm a little, you know. -Forget it. I understand. -Okay. Watch your step, watch your step. Oh, listen, I'm not so good on heights. Why don't we go and join the others. I'll buy you a new hat, for God sakes! I didn't buy it 'cause it's not functional. -It happens to look great on me. I want that hat. -All right, uh... Now let's just look around here. It's got to be here somewhere. Hey, look at this! I think I've found something, come here. My God, the stink. Hey! Come on, here's your hat. Let's go. Wait a minute. Harvey, come here. Look at this. God! That's a scroll! That's a scroll. God! It's in Aramaic. It's more than 3,000 years old. Can you read it? Yes. Uh, I'm a language professor, remember? You know, maybe it was fate that travel agent made a mistake. Humph. And it came to pass that a decree from Pharaoh went out over the land commanding all his people that every male child born of slaves shall be put to the sword. Farewell, my son. Farewell. Yes, you're, you're gonna have all the things that I cannot give you in your new home. You're going to be so happy. Yes, you're going bye-bye. Say bye-bye. Say bye-bye, Dada. Say bye-bye Dada. Here you go. You got everything you need in here. Here we go. Yes. There you go. Look what I got. Look what I got. Charlie camel. Yes, you remember him. And your rattle. What would you do without your rattle, huh? And some extra food in case you get hungry. I know how you love to eat. Just like me. (BABY WHINES) Oh, no. No. I'm going to miss you. Gonna miss you. Thus the slave Hyssop took a basket and cast it adrift in the River Nile with the hope that Pharaoh's daughter would discover the infant Herschel, and raise him as her own son. -Do I look all right? -You look gorgeous. -Here, look. -Oh, we better get up. Oh. You will be my son. Your name will be... Your name will be Moses, because that is like the word that means "to draw out". And I drew you out of the water. (SCREAMS) Shhh-shhh. Forgive me, princess. -Oh forgive me, Princess. -How dare a slave set foot on the Royal Bathing Float! Be gone before I call the guards! No, no, no, no! I had a dream that you were in need of a slave. Guardian to your newborn child. That dream is surely a sign that I am that guardian. I would defend this child with my life. I would guard this child with my life. I would, I would. Oh, you haven't seen another ark around here, have you? -Guard! -No, shhh. Uh, listen, this'll take a second. Same kind of ark, same colors, brown instead of white. You know what I mean? -Same kind of kid, too, but... -Guard! -Any of you girls seen another ark around here? -Guard! Uh, no, no, I'm going. I'm going. I'm going. I'm going the same way I came in. -Oh, father... -I, I want to play with it! He shall be raised as one of our own. Now Hyssop could not bear being parted from his infant son, so he sold himself unto the House of Senmut as a slave. And so it came to pass that Herschel grew into his manhood and entered the family business as was the custom. God this is good. -Slave! -Here. The Goddess of Fertility is almost done. Tell the high priest he can pick her up before 5:00 p.m., otherwise he has to pay our delivery charge. I'm so good at these, you know, so good. Do you think I overdo them? -No. -Huh? Mmmm. I think I've got a real feel for them. More orders came in. God, I can't believe how busy we are. Ah. This is no life. God. Working for an ungrateful family. None of them have ever lifted a mallet or a chisel in their life. They treat me, their own flesh and blood, like garbage they fished out of the river. I'm going to leave here one day. I'm going to seek my way out in the world, and there'll be no stopping me. Mmmm. Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven. I think one's missing. Ladies! -Hello, Herschel. -Hello, Herschel. Listen, I told you not to come until after hours. What is it? Will you be needing us today, Herschel? No, not today. You know we'll model for you any time, Herschel. Yeah, I, I know. We can still come over and play the game with you, can't we, Herschel? You remember, Herschel, the game we play after closing time. I love it when you dress up as Pharaoh and we're summoned before you in chains! And when we take your scepter, and... Uh, we'll have that in stock probably in a couple of weeks. Uh, listen, we'll work together really soon, and, you know, you girls will always be my four favorites. Thank you so much. Scepter? Mmm-hmm. What can I show you today? Mmm, something in Gods. May I inquire whether... Oh. Uh, is this, for that someone special? If so we, we do have gods that make ideal presents. And we do gift-wrap. Is this for your husband perhaps? -I'm without husband. -Well, uh, oh, dear... I'm sorry. No, no. I'm fine. Uhm... I can think of no better way of investing your money than in a God. I don't recall ever seeing you before in Senmut and Sons. I usually shop at Chock Full of Gods. Oh. Well, I think you'll find that we at Senmut and Sons have the most reasonable prices in town. And, and our gods are returnable within 10 days of purchase if you are dissatisfied. If I may point out the perfect choice, this is Hathor, the great cow goddess. The confidante of lovers and lovely women. I worship her myself. And if I may say, it is you. -What was the name? -Herschel. Odd name for a goddess. Uh, no, sorry. I'm Herschel. I am Herschel, and this is Hathor. And... Oh, I'm called Zerelda. Oh. That is a beautiful name. Thank you. What does she take? -Take? -As a sacrifice. Oh. Sacrifice. Uhm, let me check on it. (RINGS BELL) Slave. -Here. Oh. -Uhm, oh. (INAUDIBLE WHISPERING) Virgins. Everything on that side of the shop takes virgins unless otherwise marked. That, uh, it's, the wrong color. Uh, what, what, what, do you have in mind? Well, something that, uh, won't clash with our tent. -Mmm. -And, with this. I see nothing here that would match. But, I, I haven't shown you everything yet. Well, I, I really should be virgin, going. I must see you again! I have heard tales of fierce bandits who plunder, rape and murder. No bandits, however fierce, would dare raise a hand against us while we're in the hand of the most mighty gods. Hey, hey, shouldn't you be in chains? Yes. Yes. And they are, they're selling a new chain this year. That shackles you around the neck and I thought... Wrong. Your old one will do just fine. All the slaves are wearing them around the neck this year. Listen, I cannot afford new chains. Do you have any idea of the upkeep of a slave in this day and age? Oh, how embarrassing. I'll be the only slave on the block... Hurry up. We've got all these deliveries. You know how I hate driving at night. It isn't actually diamonds or... -What? -Nothing. -Or emeralds. -Hmm? Nothing. -It's a reflection on you, you know. I mean... -What? Nothing. Now Herschel and the slave Hyssop set out on their appointed delivery rounds as they did every Monday, Wednesday and Friday. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Bandits! I told you there would be bandits. But would you listen? Relax. Rockslides are a natural occurrence, Hyssop. You must remember that it is knowledge that will banish all fear from the hearts of men. Bandits! -Our knives are sharp! -Oh, didn't I tell you? -Our arrows are straight. -Back in the village, did I tell you? So stand and deliver if you love life! What do you think they are, tourists? Hmm, hmm? Don't, don't, don't, don't be afraid. I just remembered, we're with them. I am Herschel. And I am traveling this road with my slave Hyssop. We are in graven images, idolatry and the likes. We are not worth robbing unless you are devoutly religious. Throw down your valuables. Does that mean me? Hardly. When I give the word, jump off the cart and form the gods in a circle. Here we are, you swine. Any moment now the gods will strike you jackals with thunderbolts. Yes, thunderbolts! Any moment now. This god... This god I hold in the palm of my hand, is he very strong? That god is all-powerful you witless ass. All-powerful, is he? All-powerful. Where are the thunderbolts? Oh. No, you shouldn't think I, what I was saying... I was just having fun, you know, I, when I really like somebody I always tease them. Do you have a family? Yes. Yeah, absolutely. And you're all, all invited to dinner. Please come. Fine. I'm going to ransom you. Send them a nose, or an ear. We'll send it to your family as proof of your capture. Well, they'd probably think it was only more junk mail, you know. Then we'll slay the two of you right here and be done with it. Well, slaying is, is perfectly all right with me, but who would spread your fame? Who would tell of your daring robberies, your, your terrible fierceness? You got a point. Oh, yes, yes I have. -This one dies. -Which one? Which one? Which one? Free the salve. Take the chains off. Oh, no, no, no. Slay me instead. -Listen now, he has a point. -Yes, yes. Take, take off my ear. Listen to the voice of reason. My nose. My leg. -Silence! -My toes? All right. But before we end your master's life, I promise you it'll be a slow, extremely painful death. He wasn't so bad, really. I mean, a little chintzy about chains, but... This is your chance. Take your vengeance on him for all those years of suffering and misery. Well... Now's your chance. Go on. Enjoy it. Go on. Go, go, go. Go on. I have something really important to tell you. -Know that I am your... -Shut up! -I... Well, I just... -Be gone. Go! Go! -Yes, I just wanted to... -Go! -It won't take a second. -Go! Alone at last. Hi. Lovely beard. There must be some explanation. God! You'd of thought a thunderbolt wasn't too much to ask for. Maybe I made them wrong? I've been an idol maker for 20 years. Just thought I could cut it right now. Maybe I left something out. -Oh, Hyssop! -Oh, you're alive. -Oh, I can't believe it. -For the moment. Uh, do something! This is hot. This is very hot. How can you stand it in there? (SPITTING SOUNDS) If I only had more spit. Spit from over there. I know, pull the stake up. With all your strength. Harder. Pull up. Pull. Harder. That's it. That's it, you've got it. Now get out! Get out! Herschel's belief in his gods were shattered and he put them behind him and chose now to believe only in himself. And so left the House of Senmut and traveled unto the city of Goshen, seeking fame and fortune. That's it. That's the new, a new look that I saw in, uhm, Carthage. Uh, where most people are wearing ankle boots, you know. And I thought it looked rather nice. Your, uh, polish is also very good for hair. You're losing a lot of ankle hair. And, so he traveled unto the palace, pushing his way to fame and fortune. I trust you've all heard that Zalman is no longer among the living. Another victim of Pharaoh's wrath? Mmm. That's the fourth advisor he's put to death this month. Now we must choose a successor among ourselves. If only there were someone who would incur his wrath rather than us. -Who? -There must be someone. I can't think of anyone. Who would enter upon his most perilous position. Who could be so unsuspecting? Who could be so stupid? I ask you, where can we find such an imbecile? Oh, pardon me. I didn't realize the room was occupied. The High Priests of the court told the chambermaid that good fortune smiled upon him and thus proclaimed him the new stargazer to Pharaoh. -Slave? -Yes, Master. Is everything prepared? The orchestra has arrived and is tuning up. I want everything to be just perfect, you know? This is my first orgy. Ha. The most beautiful women. And the highest officials in Egypt shall be here tonight. Is it your hope that the girl, Zerelda, will be among them? Alas I have given up any such hope. The stars have assured me of success. I've just time to douse myself with some sweet smelling herbs and spices. I think a scent of lemon will be perfect tonight. Perhaps a touch of grapefruit behind the ear? Just, uh, just a touch. -Thank you. -Oh. Sorry. Nobody in Egypt will smell better than me tonight. Now, are you sure you want me to put the place cards on the floor? You should have done this hours ago. Do it now! -As you wish. -Now, go over the festivities one more time. Grapes at precisely 7:00 p.m. Feasting and drunken debauchery at 8:00 p.m. Orgy promptly at 9:00 p.m. and concluding at 11:00 p.m. What did you forget? Forget? How can there be drunk debauchery if you forget the wine? -Wine. -Wine. Wine at 7:30 p.m. Sorry. I'm sorry. (BELLS RINGING) There they are now. Let the orgy commence. Ahhhh. Herschel, the stargazer? Oh, I'm Herschel, the stargazer. Our Divine Pharaoh has commanded your presence at the front. Uhm, the front? I have a chariot waiting outside. We leave at once. I, I never go anywhere near fronts. Uh, wars are too loud for me. I'm strictly a palace person. Gather your things. I shall await you in the chariot. Who are we at war with this week? I don't know. Uh, Hittites? Or was it the Jebusites? I never know. They dress so much alike. Pharaoh would never make a move without me. No doubt he wanted the outcome foretold of yet another battle. Yes, that's it. Get the royal horoscopes, my gauges, my charts, everything. Might as well send the orchestra home. Oh. My orgy was the flop of the social season. Girls. There'll be other orgies. Oh. Will we ever see each other again? Oh, no tears, please. I mean, I'm only going to be gone two days at the most. But the front. Anything could happen. This may be the last moment we'll ever share together. Something I have kept hidden these many years will make you know the truth. I placed you in this ark when you were an infant. And I drifted it sown the Nile. I'd hoped the Princess, who was bathing in the river, would discover it and raise you as her own son, but another baby was there ahead of you. Before I knew it, you ended up with the Senmut family. I did want better for you. -This is true? -It's the truth. I, I may be sick. Uh... You are a slave. Which means I am the son of a slave. Which means, I, I am a slave. -Father! -Son! Son. You understand, of course, that even though I've suddenly found myself part of an oppressed people, I, I see no point in joining them. Who would I know? I mean, I, I wouldn't be very good at slavery, anyway. It's lifting mostly. I say we leave well enough alone and burn the ark. No, no! What do you think the Pharaoh would say if he discovered his personal stargazer is the son of a slave? It's all I have of you as a baby. If anyone sees this ark, you will have nothing left of me as an adult. Here. Excuse me, excuse me... Uhm, I'm getting such a sore throat. You know, I, I think maybe I'm coming down with something. I'd hate to give the army the flu, and you know, have them miss out on the battle just on account of me. You know what I mean? Oh, terrific. I left my wallet behind. Oh, great. Uh, could you stop, I left my wallet behind? I, I'm sorry to inconvenience you, but I left... Herschel the stargazer. What shall the watchword be tonight, oh Divine Pharaoh? Poo-poo! So speaks Pharaoh. Greetings, oh Divine One. I see someone's getting a new toothy. Congratulations on your victory, oh, Divine One. As our chariot approached the encampment, I saw the bodies of your enemy littering the desert, as I prophesied. You may partake of my fruits if you wish. Oh, an honor, Divine One. The ride was long and hard and I'm famished. There's been attempts on my life. I'm stunned, Divine One. And you know what? The fruit is often poisoned. Poisoned? The Royal Food Taster is out at the moment. Um, I could call him, it's no trouble. He's probably around somewhere. Food Taster! Taste this. -Food Taster! -I said taste it. (MUFFLED SPEECH) Is it the wish, is it the wish of the Pharaoh to risk the life of his ablest advisor? The dead you saw littering the desert was my army, not my enemy, Stargazer! Enemy, Divine One. Enemy! Now swallow all you're holding in your mouth. But I don't, what are you talking about? I... Swallow it! New Scribe? Well, I haven't seen you before... Delicious. You still live only because it is the will of the gods. Uhm. Last night I saw a star enter the House of Egypt. Counter attack at the break of day and the stars forever ordain your victory over the Hittites. If you indeed have read the stars well, you should feat nothing. But if my army is once again defeated, and you survive, I will have your head. So let it be written, so let it be done. So speaks Pharaoh! (UNDER BREATH) The little shit! The Hittites! The Hittites are just beyond the dunes. The Hittites are just beyond dunes. The, eh... You don't understand, I'm Herschel, the Stargazer. Excuse me, can I get through. Excuse me, you don't understand. Poopoo! Poo, Poopoo, that's the password. Excuse me. Stargazer coming through. I bring you a message from my king. Speak! You have fought bravely, but now all is lost. You can still save yourself and your men. My king will give you safe conduct home if you surrender. Tell your king that we who fought together will die together! Will somebody please shut him up! Our great king grants you life. You have no hope. In a few minutes you shall all be dead. Tell your king that we who die for the glory of Pharaoh will live forever. Will you wait, wait, wait, wait. Could we just discuss this a moment. Think of all the, uhm, the wonderful things we'll be giving up. Uhm, sunsets, flowers, the love of a good woman. Uhm, breathing. I've always been particularly fond of breathing. Finish them with arrows. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Uhm... I really do have a lot of loose ends back on the Nile. Could we possibly get together another day? Uhm... Oh, listen, I'll leave you my name and address, and, uh if, if you ever find yourself in the neighborhood with no, with no place to go, please, drop by, march through the place, burn it down to the ground, pilage, rape... -Finish them! -Not right now, God you stupid... Ohhh, my god! Ohhh! Ugh! Ugh, oh, oh. Oh, god! And so it came to, (EXCLAIMS IN DISGUST) And so it came to pass that Herschel fled from the wrath of Pharaoh. He was stripped of all rank and worldly wealth, and wandered into the blistering wilderness. A forsaken man, without a country, without a hope. -I'm sorry. -I didn't... -Shadrach! -Herschel? Oh, god, I, I haven't seen you... I don't know when. -Ah, it's been a long time. -Oh, God, yes, too long. Look at you. You look terrific. -Oh, no, no. -Yes. You're the one that looks good. -Well, I feel good. -How've you been? Great. I mean, really, you know, really great. That's nice. Very good. Things are really coming together and, and what's happening with you? Well, nothing really. -No? -No. Well, you know, it's up and down... One of those. -Hills and valleys. -Yeah. Oh dear. -My God, it's getting late. Listen, I, I gotta run, but... -Oh, yeah. -Really wonderful seeing you. -Ditto. Yeah, yeah. Let's have lunch. I'll... -Good. -Okay. Bye-bye. -Bye. -Bye. Strength to you, stranger. I am Jethro of Midian. Oh. I am Herschel, son of Hyssop. Health, wealth and happiness to you, Jethro of Midian, for giving me shelter. I thank you. -Let us break bread. -Yes, please. -Have you come far? -From Egypt. Across the desert on foot? Mmm-hmm. He-Who-Has-No-Name must have guided your steps... Oh. He-Who-Has-No-Name? Another god. I have worshipped 2,000 gods in my time and not one of them has been worth the sacrifice of a field mouse, much less what I paid on livestock. If you're in need of a wife, I'm father of seven daughters and only one husband among them. Moses, the Egyptian fellow with the stutter. Said he was a prince or something. Married my daughter Zipporah. Now he's prince of my flock. Ha. Well, it must be wonderful in your old age to have your family around you. Especially when you sit down together and, uh, partake of that delicious bread. (MUSIC BEGINS) My daughters will now entertain you. They're all very talented. Hey... Zerelda! Zerelda! It's me, Herschel, from the Idol Maker's Shop, Senmut and Sons. Yes, Herschel, from the Idol Makers Shop. I remember you. I have something of yours, I have always carried with me. For you. -Thank you. -A pleasure. Leave us, my daughters. And take all this broken bread with you. There is someone who can warm my heart. Your heart speaks louder than your tongue. I will wed Zerelda, if she'll have me. Herschel, you shall have your own tent, on your own piece of land. Ohhh. It is my wedding gift to you and my daughter. You got anything a bit more, uhm, uh, rather than... Uh, yes, nice. It's, it's perfect. Perfect. Thank you, oh, Jethro of Midian. -Where was I? -Wedding night. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. My wedding night approaches and I, I am not, uhm, learned in the ways of love making. Love making. Don't know how to do it. Right. -Right. I was wondering, could you uhm... -Help you? -Please, let me know. -Of course. My little sister, when your wedding night comes up, you shall do in your husband's bed what the sheep do in the fields. Oh God! Zerelda? Yes? Arriving shortly. Jethro must have sand on the brain to give us this land! Give me your hand. Zerelda, I love you. Baaaaaa... What? Baaaa! Oh. Baaaaaa. Now Herschel, help keep the flock of Jethro and dwelt under the shadow of Sinai, the mountain of the one true god. -Baaaaa. -Not now, Zerelda. -Uh, Herschel... -Hmm? Moses and Zipporah invited us over for dinner tonight. Oh, can't we get out of it? I already told them we'd be there around sevenish. Oh. Tell them I have a headache. Mmmm, we never go anywhere. It's a desert! Now we have the choice of your father's tent, Moses and Zipporah's tent, or your other sister's tents. It doesn't make any difference which tent we go to anyway. -All they talk about is sheep. -Well, it's a family business. Well, I, somehow believe that my life would have greater purpose. Oh, Herschel, you have the respect of the sheep. But I'm not even entrusted with the flock, just the stragglers. Herschel! There's Jethro on my back again. Yeah, here, here. Take those stragglers on up the mountain so they can be numbered with the flock. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Do not keep Moses waiting. (MIMICKING) Mmm. Oh, uh, we'll go to Moses' and Zipporah's tonight. Oh, great. -Baaaa. -Baaaa. See you later. Something burning? BOOMING VOICE: Come no nearer. Huh? Ahem. Is that you Moses? Uh, listen, I've, I've got your sheep up here, wherever you are. If it's all right with you, I'll leave 'em here and I'll, I'll go. Uh, it's about time I started down the mountain. BOOMING VOICE: Take thy shoes from off they feet. For the ground on which thou standest is holy ground. I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. Come now, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou may bringest forth my people out of Egypt. Me? Now therefore, go! And I will be with thee. You want me? Me? Hey, you want me? Me? Oh, oh, Zerelda, he wants me. He wants me. Zerelda! Zerelda! Zerelda! Zerelda! Zerelda! Wait'll you hear. Wait'll you hear what happened on the mountain! -Calm yourself. -Everybody here, everybody, everybody. Everybody here. Why are you not on the mountain tending my sheep? -Because I quit. -You quit? -Yeah, I quit. -Oh, Herschel, no! I've had it with sheep. I stood on holy ground. Holy ground, Zerelda. Herschel, did you lose good sandals? He told me to take the shoes from off my feet. Who? God. The One true God spoke to me on the mountain. I had the feeling that was it! Oh, Herschel, did you tell him I said hello? He, he, he did most of the talking. How do you know it was God? And not some practical joker? How did I know? I know gods! Senmut and Sons! You forget I was in the business. Forget about that. What did he say? He said... That I should go into Egypt and deliver His people out of bondage. Oh, Herschel. Do you know how? I was, chosen. God will show me the way. Oh, He spoke like, like thunder in the storm. I could tell he was, he was used to addressing large groups of people. You know, a very commanding voice. Really sure of himself. -(IMITATING) I am the... -Wait a minute, wait. Hey, everybody, my husband has just talked with God! Come here. He's doing God now. He's doing God. He just talked to him. Okay, go ahead, do it. (IN A DEEP VOICE) I am the God, thy father. I am the God of Abraham. I'm, I am the... I, I, I, I'd have to hear him a few more times before I got him down pat. But, you know, that's the general idea. Never mind. It was wonderful. Ha. Come, my wife, we must begin our journey. Thus Herschel took Zerelda and set her upon her ass and began the long journey into Egypt. Over hill and dale, rivers and mountains. Deserts and canyons. Can you believe this, Zerelda? This is no everyday occurrence, Zerelda. This is the hand of God! I parted the water! We're talking miracles! Oh, Herschel, you're first! Okay, I'm going to let the water go, so pick up your fish and we'll move upstream. Alms! Alms! Alms! Alms! Alms! Alms! Be of good cheer, thou unfortunate wretch. Thank you. Alms! Alms! Alms! Alms! With the power given to me from above, I will make you see again. Oh, no you won't, no. No you won't. Alms! Alms! And walk again. No. Please, sir, please, sir, I beg you. There are others in this town far more deserving than my, myself. Beat it! Alms! We are all, we are all children of the Lord and equally deserving of His love. I, I, I, I couldn't agree with you more. In fact, there's, there's a leper colony not three leagues from here. Make a left at the first large clump... Lift up thine eyes unto the Lord and thou shalt see! Oh, oh, sir, please. I am happy getting the pity of my townspeople. I get it from them sometimes as much as twice a day. Don't blow it. Alms! Alms! O Lord God, let Thy healing power come through my hands and into the eyes of this unfortunate man. Thou shall see. Owwww! What do you want to do, blind me? Look, he who was bind can see. -It's a miracle. -His second. Yes, it's a miracle, but, ohhhhh, I'm still lame as a duck. -I am cripple, I shall never walk. -Rise up. Please, believe me, you've done enough, both of you. You've been very fine, but... -Alms! Alms! -Rise up! No, I'm content to grovel. I must grovel down here. I cannot walk. -Walk! -I can't walk! I, I can walk. Oh, look, he who was once lame now can walk. It's a miracle. His third. Beg no more. Go praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Keep the faith. Who are thou, stranger? I'm Herschel, son of Hyssop. Nice work. Well, it's the work of the Lord. On your way somewhere? -Egypt. -So soon? Ahh, well, if you must know, I am delivering the children of the Lord out of bondage. And He in His infinite wisdom has guided you here. Deliver us first! From what? Amok! The biggest, strongest, and most dreaded of all the giants. He stands nine cubits, just from the crotch to the heel of the foot. That means, that means that he's got a twelve foot ins... Inseam. -Oh, yes. -Mmm-hmm. -You know his measurement. -I am his tailor. -Ahhhh. -He has a tailor. He may be a bloodthirsty giant, but he does keep up his appearance. Always in fashion. He was wearing open toe sandals before it became the fad. Chic or not, he is still a giant and we want no part of him! So could you? -Could I what? -Smite him! ALL: Oh, yes! Our town should be thriving. Are we thriving? No! All because of him! Ahhh, gather around me. That's enough. Just because somebody is taller than us, you, you needn't wish him harm. We are all brothers in the eyes of the Lord. Open your hearts, show him kindness. Uh, you there. What has Amok ever done to you? -Nothing. -Nothing. But he squashed my grandmother once. It was horrible. She was lying on the ground, her eyes were bulging out. He crushed my cousin flatter than a matzo. -He'd walk all over us if you'd let him. -Right. Oh, Herschel, I think, uh, you should have a chat with him. Indeed I should. Hey, Shorty! I come in the name of the One True God, who will make me victorious over you, Amok. (LAUGHS) Oh! Ah! Oh, you didn't have to hit him there, did you? I was aiming, aiming between his eyes. You shouldn't have hit him there! Oh, false prophet! And the angry giant stepped heavily upon the village. And those among the villagers, who were not made flat, rose up against Herschel and curse his name, and he was sent into slavery. Ah, a little one. Come on. Greetings. I think you're gonna like it here. Water, come here. Quick. (FLY BUZZING) What? Squashed foot. Squashed foot. Washed foot? You're on my... Do any of you, any of you, uh, any of you understand Ethiopian? Or Nubian? Now say, say it slowly, I can't understand you. Rock... Rock-k-k-k-k? -Rock-e-e-e-e... -Rock-e-e-e-e? Throw him in! What? No, no, don't. (LAUGHS) And behold, the Angel of the Lord appeared unto Herschel in his hour of darkness and a heavenly light shined in the pit. -Hi. Hi. -Oh, oh! I thought I was forsaken but, but at last you've, you've come bearing a message from the Lord. Oh, no, no, no. No, you're, you're still forsaken. But, you mean the Lord didn't send you to, to deliver me from the hands of the Taskmaster? No, no, no, as far as I know, no. Maybe I wasn't making myself clear. I'm perishing here in a salt mine. And making much too much of it, if you ask me. Oh, listen, God spoke to me on the mountain. (IN VOICE OF GOD) I am the God of thy Father. I am the God of Abraham. That, that's fantas... That's uncanny. That is, you got, you got him down pat. Well, I, I, I've been working on it, you see. But I'm, I'm supposed to be delivering His children out of bondage in Egypt! I'm sorry. Look, until I have a signed document... Ahhh! On you, with your name on it, signed by somebody in a very high position, I cannot lift one little finger to help you out. I'm sorry. And since you won't have a little drinky with me, I guess I'll be on my way now. Bye. -Hey! What are you, you can't do this. -Oh, yes, I can. -You can't! -Please, where's my wife? That's trouble, for you. As the Angel of the Lord soared into the heavens. He told Herschel to look for his wife, in the most, wicked of cities. -Whoa, ho, ho, hold it. -Is, is this the road to the most wicked of cities? Shhh, shhh, shhh, shhh. You don't know who's around here. -You never know who's around. -Oh, sorry. All right, come on, get in. Hurry up, get in. Just find a spot. But, uh, hey, hey, hey, hey, all right, all right, put, put that down. Look, don't touch my fruit and mind you don't quench your thirst on my elixirs. That is not your everyday produce back there. -Oh. -Okay, move it, move it. Get up, get up, get up! Tell me about this most wicked of cities. -Sodom. -Yeah, yeah. They had fire, they had brimstone. You name it, they got it. Oh, he gave it to them good. Ha! Ha-ha. But you know people, though, how they love a party. -They built it right back. -Yeah. They got it, uh, they got it bigger, they got it more wicked than they had before. -Now they call it New Sodom. -New Sodom. Get over there! Have you, uh... Have you heard of my wife Zerelda? I'm looking for her. -Zerelda? -Mmm. Zerelda, Zerelda, Oh, yeah, Zerelda. Mmm. -Zerelda, you've, you've heard of her? -That depends. -On what? -Uhm, would you care to buy a sundial? Uhm, I would love to, but I, I have no money. -The same old song. -Oh. Yeah, I've seen her. She has taken up with Amok, the giant. -Amok, the giant? -Yes. -Oh, no! -Yeah. -Amok, the giant? -Yeah. Oh. How much longer is it? I don't know. You'll have to ask Zerelda that. I mean to New Sodom. Oh, that's not far. Love your hair. What? I love the way the sun is glistening through your hair. It's beautiful. Ah! (ALL CLAMORING) I'm Herschel, son of Hyssop, I, I wish to enter your city. No one passes without the king's permission. Unless you're one of those eunuchs who'll be waiting on his banquet this evening. (IN A SHRILL VOICE) Oh, open your gates. Hear ye! Hear ye! There will be incestuous and other unnatural acts tonight at the Lodge of Good Fellowship! Bring your own relatives! Oh, yes. Oh, oh, more, more. Oh, more, yes, harder, harder. Oh, that's it. Oh, more, yes, harder, harder. Yes, oh, oh, yes, love that. Oh, more, harder, harder. (MOANING) Maybe the three of us could go to your room. You! (CLEARING THROAT) See you later. No, I thought I gave him the slip. You know this man? (STAMMERING) Well, I... I occasionally may have manifested myself before him, when... When times, we're particularly slow, but he's, uh, just a casual acquaintance, I assure you. You, shut that door. What were you doing outside of this room? Oh, just a, uh, spot of fresh air, and, uh... Uh, a little stretch of the wings, that's all. (KNOCKING AT DOOR) This is Mrs. Memnet your landlady. Do you shepherds have girls in there? No, Mrs. Memnet, no girls. Sheep? (WHISPERING) This town disgusts me beyond belief. No, Mrs. Memnet, no sheep. Keep it quiet and behave yourselves. Or out you go! Yes, Mrs. Memnet. She's gone. For too long now this city has incurred His righteous indignation. It must be destroyed one more time. No. If we go out on a limb with one of these fancy plagues of ours, and it fizzles, So, I say, and I think we'll really catch hell from Him. So... I say and I think you'll agree, we go with fire and brimstone. Any questions? You have something on your mind? Me! Uh, I have me on mind. I mean, what about me? What about you? You cannot destroy me, along with this city. God has spoken with me. Uh, he does God real good. -Oh, no. -No, no, do it, do it. -No! -Oh, it's really great! I... I must deliver His people out of bondage, in Egypt! And my wife is here, too. -Zerelda's in town? -Yes. Oh, all right. All right. You and your wife will be spared. Only you must be out of the gates before midnight. And one word of warning, if either of you turn back to look in the direction of the city, you will be turned into a pillar of salt. As Lot's wife was. Yeah. Thank you. Eunuch! (IN A SHRILL VOICE) Yeah. Shouldn't you be pouring wine? Then start pouring. Big boy, love it. (CLEARING THROAT) (IN NORMAL VOICE) Zerelda! (IN A SHRILL VOICE) Zerelda, Zerelda, Zerelda. (IN NORMAL VOICE) Zerelda! Zerelda. Zerelda! Herschel, are you having fun? I'd given up hope of ever finding you again. MAN: More wine, eunuch! Dance over this way. I'm one of the eunuchs serving at the banquet. (IN A SHRILL VOICE) More wine. Herschel, you have changed. Not in the least. (IN NORMAL VOICE) Come on, we're getting out of here. -What do you mean we're getting out of here? -Come on. Beware! Turn from your evil ways before God destroys you and your city with fire from the sky... And put some clothes on. Grab your bag and let's go, Zerelda. -Just one thing... -Come on, don't pack. So it is true what they were saying about you and Amok, the giant. I'm sure I don't know who you mean. Oh, come off it, Zerelda. He visits you here, doesn't he? Not anymore. God! What were you doing when I was in the salt mine, wasting away? Well, you had God. So you just picked up and chased after the first giant you met. It was just a physical thing. Oh, fine. Amok and I were very discreet about it. Discreet? They probably saw you doing it as far away as Babylonia. Come on. (THUNDER CRACKING) Come on, it's almost midnight. -I don't want to go. -Come on. I've made a lot of good friends in Sodom and you didn't even give me a chance to say goodbye. We haven't got time. Don't look back. Zerelda, don't look back! Zerelda! Zerelda, answer me! Listen, if you want to be alone, I'll understand. Ah! Oh, you've come to tempt me, Devil. Man gives in to temptation freely enough without any help from me, thank you very much. Tempt me, Devil, and you'll fail. Fine. Fine, fine. Fine, just, please sit down. Relax, don't get tense. I've no intention of leading you from the path of righteousness or whatever. Can you believe that? An entire city up in smoke. What a temper. Shouldn't you be in Hell? Everyone in that city was just damned. I'm picking them up. Oh. I wasn't always the Devil you know. I was an angel once. You were? I've known Him longer than anyone. We started out together. We were partners. How did you become the Devil? Oh, it was very simple. God comes over to me and says, "Here, try this on." (SIGHING) Well, here come the damned now. They'll be expecting me. Listen, you'd probably be surprised to know that a lot of those original ideas were mine. What do you mean? For instance, three of the four seasons, that was mine. Oh. -Great. -Mmm-hmm. And trees. Mine. Trees, you like trees? Trees, uh, trees are great. My idea. You're to be congratulated. Thank you. A pleasure. But what can you do. What can you do. Tears me up sometimes. HARVEY: (VOICEOVER) Herschel continued forth across the desert into Egypt to fulfill his mission. And to find his father, Hyssop, where he had left him -in the comforts of his home. -Hoppity hop, Hoppity hop, -(KNOCKING ON DOOR) -Nobody's home. Come on, here we go. There we go. There, that's a good boy. Yes, there we go. I said no one is home. Why... Oh, oh, no. Oh, my son! -Oh, my son. -Oh, Father! Oh, my son. My... (BOTH LAUGHING) Oh, my son. Oh, I missed you. I missed you. Oh, it's so good to have you home. Look at you, you look wonderful. -Well... -Let me see. Have you lost any of your hair? -No. -You will soon. Soon, soon. -Ah. -You'll put on a few pounds, just like me. Where are my things? Oh, well, uh, things were tough. I had to sell a few little things. Not to worry. The house is in a mess. You haven't looked after it very well. And these frogs, they're everywhere. Yes, the frogs are the work of the chosen one who is called upon to deliver us out of bondage. Why I didn't summon up these frogs from the river. No, no, no, it is not of you I speak. I speak of Moses. Moses? Last week Moses turned the waters into blood. (SCOFFING) This week it's frogs. Moses is the chosen one that God has called upon to deliver us out of bondage. No, no, no, no! God called upon me! I am the chosen one! You're putting me on. Moses and I were... Were shepherds together in the wilderness. He couldn't keep his flock. I was always having to round up his stragglers. God wouldn't entrust somebody like Moses with a mission like that. I know Moses. His wife and my wife are sisters, which makes him my brother-in-law. -You took a wife? -Yes. -Well... -She's outside. Well, bring her inside so I can make my daughter-in-law welcome. She's a bit... You took a... Well, just don't stand there, bring her inside. Don't keep the girl waiting. He took a wife. I thought I'd never see the day. Oh, soon we'll have little leaping children around, instead of all these frogs. I don't know how I look. If only I'd been prepared. (MUMBLING) Welcome to my house... (BABBLING) My wife, Zerelda, Dad. (GASPING) (GROANING) She seems like a friendly girl. -She is. -Nice smile. Nice... -Hands. -Hands nice. Hair... My goodness, this is what you've been up to. Yeah. Oh! Maybe... Maybe you ought to cover her with a cloth. I'd never forgive myself if, uh, a daughter-in-law of mine got chipped. -Dad, don't make a fuss, all right? -No fuss. Please. It's all right. It's all right. But listen, listen. (STAMMERING) I have to clear up this confusion about the chosen one. I, I have to gain an immediate audience with Pharaoh. What if he remembers you? What, what if he remembers you? What then? Then off comes your head! I shall not be alone. -Oh, I can't. I have work. I've got to, -Oh, no, no, no. God will be with me. -Oh, yeah? -Mmm. -Oh, then I'll go along for a couple of hours. -Good. Which one's the prophet? How many minutes do you do? -Do? -How long are you gonna be on? Uh... Yeah, right, right, keep it short and funny, huh? You follow Timba the dancing elephant. Don't worry, the Lord will be with me. Why the basket? If I tell you, you'll just be angry. I won't be angry. Oh, you will. -I will not be angry. -I promise you, you'll be angry. I won't be angry. All right. I'll need the basket when the Pharaoh cuts off your head. -Now that makes me angry. -Prophet, you're on. And what do we do? We sing. We dance? I'm warning you. Timba is a hell of an act to follow. I come in the name of the One true God. Another damned prophet. The One true God. Well, we'll just look him up in the Book of Gods. One True God. One True this, One True that, One True, One True, One True... I don't seem to have much of One True anything in my book. Perhaps, he changed his name. (ALL LAUGHING) -(LAUGHTER STOPS) -(ALL LAUGHING) -(LAUGHTER STOPS) -(ALL LAUGHING) (LAUGHTER STOPS) The whole universe is filled with the might and power of God! He existed before the world was created! It is He who stretched the heavens above like a curtain. It is He who laid the foundations of the earth. I mean, if you concede the Universe, you must concede Him. He created everything out of nothing, even you, the ruler of this kingdom! That cannot be, for I am God, I am... (BABBLING) ...the son of God. He is the son of the father of the son, with the great father. Faster, faster. Who created the Nile that gives life to everyone. (ALL AGREEING) Does... Does your God have magic? Ah, far greater than Pharaoh's magic. (LAUGHING) You tore your ass on that one. Leon, hit it. (ALL GASPING) What a honey, huh? Strike! Strike! Strike! Ah! (SCATTERED LAUGHTER) Mine takes a bit more time to warm up. (ALL LAUGHING) I know you from somewhere. Faster with the fan, please. And, uh, I'll have a pistachio later. Let my people go. Um, hum a few bars. Uh oh, no, that's my pictures... What people? All the slaves you hold in bondage. There are no slaves in bondage... -They're gone. -Gone? Bye-bye. Tip-toe. But who... Who... Moses. * The most beautiful sound I ever heard * Moses! Moses! Moses? He had great magic. His staff devoured Ian's staff. Moses. I'm gonna kick his ass, you know that, don't you? How could you let Moses take them? The man was phenomenal. What, are you kidding me? Did you ever see Moses' shit in action? There must be some mistake. I was supposed to deliver them from bondage. We all got a cross to bear, all right? Moses put some heavy action on it. Curses on our homes. Ten plagues on my house. And if that wasn't bad enough, he split the Red Sea in half. Moses? I mean, zip, down the middle. (EXCLAIMING) Cover quick, and no excuses. You like fruit? Bring me a grape, pluck it into my mouth, foolish prophet. You heard only the boys. Ah. Did you wash your hands, you scoundrel? No, I, I didn't. Sorry. Away with you. Nourish thyself, Divine One. Stargazer! Flee, father, flee! Would you hold this a minute please? Excuse me. Cast Herschel, the Stargazer into the dungeon! Tomorrow you'll be fitting entertainment for my court. Oh, I'll rehearse some new harp and lute numbers immediately. Your beheading shall be quite enough entertainment. Beheading? I, what if I'm a hit and you want a repeat performance? So let it be written! So let it be done! Big boy, love it! Just perfect. (HUMMING) Everybody. I was once angel of the Lord. That should be good for at least one drink on the house, in any reputable wine shop! -Excuse me. -Oh, that, that's all right. That's all right. I, uh... I couldn't help overhearing. If you are truly the Angel of the Lord. It's not "are", do you understand what I'm saying? It is "was". Was, was, the Angel of the Lord. Then you must know my son. A prophet of the Lord. I'm, I'm sure you must have bumped into each other somewhere along the way. My son is in the Pharaoh's dungeon. The Pharaoh will cut off his head unless you help him. You are not listening to what I have been talking about, have you? -Yeah. -I am no longer the Angel of the Lord. I am a Fallen Angel. Disgraced, dishonored, reproached, dismissed from all favor, put to shame, put down, and tarnished. Oh, I'm sorry. You have no hope with me. You see, my son was supposed to deliver the slaves out of bondage, -but everything went wrong. -Don't cry. It's been a terrible day. I've been holding it in all day long, I can't... -Don't, don't cry. -I know... I knew when you said I'm the... I was the Angel of the Lord, I thought, here it is... -I understand, I understand. I'll tell you what... -What? -...I'm going to do... -What? What? -I'm going to give it a try. -You will? -Yes! -That's all I ask. -But don't you dare... -No. What? -...expect any miracles. -Never! Come, come, this way. It's this way. -Do you need any help? No, I don't need any help. Come, come, come. You! I might've known it was you. -Boo! -Oh! A little surprise. I brought the Angel of the Lord, my son. -Former. -Yeah, former. (SHUSHING) Listen, there's very little of the night left. And my head... My head comes off at dawn. So... What are you doing? Mmm, nothing, nothing. You will be out of here before you know it. You'll be free, my son. I told you dad would fix it up. You'll be out walking, and singing and shopping, for my new chains. -You promised me, remember? -No, no, I won't start. -You remember? -Do you think you can do it? Not a prayer. What am I going to do with my son? (SHUSHING) Don't cry, don't cry. I'll tell you what I'll do, I'll give these old wings one last flap. All right? And then maybe we can spring him. I know you can do it. Here, let me put this around your waist. Here, oh, oh... You all right? Yeah. I'm fine. I'm fine. Here, let's put it... Let's put it over your shoulders, between the wings. I know you're gonna do it. I know it. Okay, okay. (GROANING) Pull! Pull! Pull! Oh! Yes, come on. Here, help me. All right, I gotcha. I've gotcha. All right, now. The other one. Okay. You did it! (COUGHING) Was there ever any doubt? We must go. Thank you. Oh. -It's all right, it's all right. -I, I hope you get your -wing back on. -I will. You're really impossible, you know that though. You can take care of yourself from now on. Yeah. Thank you. -Come. Thank you. -Thank you. Goodbye. HARVEY: (VOICEOVER) And so, once more Herschel fled from the wrath of Pharaoh. And came to dwell again under the shadow of Sinai. Where his path crossed with Moses one last time. It kills me. It kills me. I love it, I just love it. I told you, Moses doesn't like you fooling around with his things. (ROCKS CLATTERING) Ah, that about does it. I couldn't have left Moses alone and forsaken on the mountain. Even if it meant putting up with him for forty days and forty nights. If I hear about the parting of the Red Sea one more time, I'll stuff these tablets down his throat. And he never leaves our tent. (SCOFFING) Moses would never leave the tent and face the people without the Commandments God promised him. A promise is like a thick blanket that leaves you shivering when the weather turns cold. Well... (GROANING) Well, I could only think of ten. So, it's better than nothing. Honor thy mother and father. Did you include that one? -That was mine. -Yes. -What about all that coveting? -Yes. Thou shalt not covet. That's in. -And then the, other one about adultery. -Mmm. Yeah. Did you finally decide to include that one? And the other one, that's a good one. The other one about, you know, not taking other people's things. Yes, yes, yes. -You need any help? -No. Those two tables were a lot of work, you know? Mmm. I just hope he takes care of them. All those years it was Moses. Moses all along. Not me. (SCOFIFNG) I've got work to do. Mmm. My greatest work. You know, there are already those who've made inquiries about you. You will soon have a multitude of worshippers. You'll soon have burnt offerings galore. Soon, all the world will bow down and kiss your granite asp. Fell right into my trap. (GROANING) Ah! I know you're a jealous God. I knew an idol, such as this, would arouse your wrath and bring you down here. I planned it. So, speak up. BOOMING VOICE: Thou shalt have no other gods before me. You like that? That's number one. I had you in mind when I wrote it. Ha. I only had this idol for bait. So now you're here with me. And now you will hear me. Thank you. Thank you. I lived in your world's cradle of civilization and all men knew was poverty, war and slavery. Now what I want to know is, where were you? I mean, let it be known if you're keeping another world on the side. Let it be known if you created two worlds and you're spending all the time with the other one. I mean, that would answer one of my questions. (RUMBLING) BOOMING VOICE: Who are you to question the Lord? Who am I? I am man! (THUNDER CRACKING) Ah! Was it you who commanded the morning to bring on the day? Can your voice reach the clouds and bring on the rain? Can you send down lightning? Does the hawk soar because of your wisdom? Does the eagle fly at your command? And so I ask again, who is this mortal who finds fault with the Lord? Who questions his judgment? And who just stopped the rain? Very good. (COUGHING) I'm impressed. I'm impressed. Good, good stuff. Listen, tell me, how could you get on letting me believe all this time that I was the chosen one, but all along it was Moses? I believed you were with me. I was with you. When were you ever with me? I was with you during the writing of the Ten Commandments. Nobody was with me during the writing of the Ten Commandments. Well, uh, except my father and he was... You wrote the Commandments through me, and I gave them to Moses through you. Oh, um, thanks. Thanks a lot. (LAUGHING) I mean I, am I going to believe... Am I going to be remembered for my participation in any of this? Someone will know. Somewhere, someday. Well, all right, as long as someone knows. (STAMMERING) I mean, I would... I would hate to be forgotten, you know? I understand. You do? One more thing, Herschel, you don't do me very well. So, no more impressions. (HORN HONKING) -What was that? -Uh, the bus. Yes, it's getting late. Um... Let's take this back. Take it back to town. We can read the rest of it there. -All right. -And be careful of it. Oh, boy! (LAUGHING) Oh, no, God! Oh, God, the book is gone. Oh, God. Well... That's the end of Herschel and Zerelda. (CHATTERING) Three bucks? All right, make sure you all have your belongings. Take your time, there sister. Right, allright, sister. Okay, now everyone. Look, if there is a God, why would he have us find that book and then... And then have it blown away in the wind. You know what they say. The Lord works in mysterious ways. TOUR GUIDE: Well, uh... We'll have another stop very, very shortly. Uh, but we'll have to... Oh, Mohammed! Mohammed, I'm stuck, I'm stuck in the door. Mohammed, stop the bus? Mohammed! Stop it! (BOOMING LAUGHTER) (CACKLING) (BOOMING LAUGHTER)
