OK, lets drink up and go for a swim. C'mon, Ann. You gonna sleep all day? So, you want to be coaxed, hein? Hey! It's enough for you, Fred! Mutiny, ehh? OK, you're going overboard! Hey! You give that back, Fred Miller! Hum, hum. Come and get it. You better to get back to me, Fred. Ok. Coming right up. Oh, Fred. Fred. Fred. Fred? Fred! Fred? Hello. Would you fly somewhere right the way? I'd fly anywhere with you baby, but you better ask the pilot. Hello there! I understand you run the charter service. I want to hire the plane. Now wait a minute lady. If this is some process service gang, just to make me admit that I'm Grant Murdoch, you're gonna wish you hadn't pulled it. I'm afraid I don't know... ...jointing Outline Motors they will never get the $1,100 I own and they got me in the court when I should be flying that plane trying to make a buck Whatever you're talking about, Mr. Murdoch, I'm sorry, but I don't have the time for it. Just what is it you want me to do? I told you. I want to rent your plane. OK. Where to? Provincetown. Provincetown? Swell, right into a tropical storm. What tropical storm? There's a beaut blowing up in the Caribbean. With lots of luck, we might outrun it to Provincetown, but not with my kind of luck. Let's put it in another way. Do you want double your regular fee? Now look miss, - Letterman, Jan Letterman. - Believe me, I'm not against money Miss Letterman, but I'm not quite ready to sell my life... Triple. I'll give you three times your regular price. That's just about the market price for one slightly used life It's a deal! Only we better to get in the air fast! If the radio operator spots it she'll throw the book rule book at me. Who are you? Another spy from the studio? This is a nice man who will fly us to Provincetown so we can make the dress rehearsal. Good! I gonna make a rehearsal very important. Now you're sure you're not a spy? No, I'm your leading man. Don't ever let 'em shoot you from this side. You got a lousy right profile. Yeah. I'll try to remember that. Murdock to East River Sky Port Control. Murdock to East River Sky Port Control. Come in Liz. East River Sky Port Control to Murdoch, over. Hello Amy. Clock me to 143. Destination Provincetown. Repeating, destination Provincetown. Sorry about this, kid, over. All right Mr. Murdock. Now turn that ship around and bring it right back-down here. I can't take the responsibility for this... I said I was sorry baby, but you know how it is. I've got a woman here with a very rare blood type. We're flying her out to Rubinstein Park. Blood transfusion. You mean, you're flying there for a money transfusion. Well, all right daredevil. You're a big boy now. You can take care of yourself. Over and out. Good luck big buck. You mean you're taking that big of chance because of us? Maybe. It all depends. On what? On whether or not we all get killed. If we do the FAA might lift my license. Is it bad? It's no good. We've only got about an hour of flying time ahead of us. That storm is almost on top of us. Can't you fly over it? I think for the left. Why this louse alarm? Do you have gas? We have lots of gas but it's not getting through the cylinders. - I'll have to try to set it down. - Where? Well, there should be some small inhabited islands in this area. - We are looking for one of them. - Maybe we ought to pray a little too. You pray, I'll look. It will be our island paradise time. Just two of us. And Tom, I don't care if the Navy never finds us. Cat. You pray pretty good Miss Letterman. No! No! Lookout! All right. Let's get going! I want to get this plane tied down before that storm hits. Our lunch? This one stays here. OK, see if you wake Miss Winters, huh? So, you know who she was all along. Are you kidding? From Broadway to Hollywood and 14,000 headlines. Summer stock! Sowwy! Ok Miss Winters. You're on your own now. The plane needs mourning too. What's going on? If this is Provincetown were Norwegian. But that's where we are. And I know we are luck to be here. Hey! Wait a minute, Yo! What are you doing with that plane? You were hired to drive us to Provincetown. He will Miss Winters. Just as soon as the motor is fixed. Listen, you idiot! You can't just strand me on this sand pile. My show opens tomorrow night! Just get over to that plane and fix it! The carburetor will have to de-ice itself. And right now we better look for some kind of shelter. It may look great now, but that wind's right on our tail. Has this thing frigtened you? This equipment must make me look like one of those creatures from a horror film. Where did you jam your boat? We flew here. Ah, I see. Perhaps you had to land here to avoid the storm. Oh no, we were just scouting for tuna fish and we dropped down for a jar of mayonnaise. We had a little motor trouble, And your island was here. Gos are really mad. I'm just here to do some research out of the station. Cambridge. Peter Bar tell. I'm a professor of marine biology. Look professor Bar tell. Can we just skip the formal introductions till we can get to your shelter? Oh, forgive my terrible hospitality. I wasn't expecting guests. Please follow me. Leave ma alone! I know how to walk! I said, leave me alone! You heard her. Leave her alone. - Wait, fine. - Hey you wait! You're fired! Oh! Better get my shoes. What a shame. The poor woman never had the chance. What caused it? Sharks, I guess. They don't usually appears at this far north. The tropical storm must have driven them up here. The woman could be bathing in your own beach when it happened. If it is hungry enough it can came close to the shore. Well, we'd better to cover this thing. Yes, there's no time to bury it now. Bury? Won't the authorities want it for identification? Oh, yes. You're of course. Some little families are searching for a mother, or a daughter, at this very moment. Normally these dunes would protect me against the sea winds, but with this hurricane coming you have to batten down the tent farther. Ah! Don't be frightened. It's only Louis. Louis? My little pet. He's barely good company for the expedition. Come. Please, make yourselves at home. All right. Let's go Mister. It's Murdock! Professor Grant Murdock. Hurry up Mr. Murdock. We don't have much time. I don't remember your name, but... I do remember enough to thank you. No thank is necessary. Well, I'm Grant Murdock, and that's Professor Bar tell. Professor, Miss Laura Winters the secretary Jan Letterman I should have recognized you. But, you see, I have so little time for motion pictures. Skip it, professor. I'm not big on marine biology either. When do we get out of here? Well you can forget about it for today, Miss Winters. Even after to storm passes there'll still be too much turbulence for flying. But we can get up first thing in the morning, can't we? I'm afraid we'll just have to wait and see. See? What? Whether we are alive by then, Miss Letterman. This island is completely unprotected. I can assure you we are in for a good pounding. Well, I think the worst is over. You should be able to take of now. I'm afraid not. Those tail winds are still too rough for my ship. I see. Sorry. Look, I've got an inflatable raft in the plane. It can double as an extra bed for one of the the ladies. Ah, very good. And we can better share of ourselves I have some spare blankets in the trunk behind the tent. Good! Wait. At least I can give you a help. Oh Jan sweet. Would you do Laura a big favor? Bring back that other suitcase with you? The one with all my night things. All right. I'm glad you managed to get away You know, I came with you Mr. Murdock because I wanted to explain something about Laura. Yeah. How about that? The plane is still in one piece. Laura is a very frightened person, Grant. She's afraid to work and she's afraid nothing. She's got a kind of private ghost that haunts her. A ghost called failure Laura Winters didn't discover trouble the way Columbus discovered America. You can't really be as tough as you sound. What have you got against Laura personally? Is there something about her that reminds you your own trouble? Please skip the free psychoanalysis. Believe me, I don't have any feelings about Miss Winters. Frankly, I'm too busy worrying about some real problems. Like him, for instance. He's taking a long hike for supplies that are supposed to be just behind the tent. What about it? I'm not sure. There are a couple of things that just don't add up. Like what? Well, like sharks being responsible for that skeleton. Sharks don't eat the meat and leave the bones. They'll snap out the arm at the elbow or a leg at the knee. But whatever caused this skeleton made a neat little fillet of it. Not a shred of flesh left, but every bone intact. But why did the professor lie? That's a very good question. OK. you wait here! I'll get the raft and the suitcase. Grant, do me a favor? When you get the other tings, will you bring Laura's lunch? Sorry. The liquor stays on the plane. But she's going to need it tonight, I can tell. Look, when I get in Provincetown, she can guzzle all she wants. But while I'm in charge, no bottle parties. Everything all right with the plane? It's under control. I see you got the shelter thrown up. Did you have to go far for the blanket? No, I thought I told you. I keep the supplies right and back. Well, if you excuse me, I'll pump the bed up. Knock, knock. Just a minute. Just thought I'd change something a little more practical. That's nice. Where is the suitcase? Oh I'm sorry, I forgot it. Your forgot it? What do you mean you forgot it? You can remember every bill you ever paid for me. You don't even carry an address book. That's how bad your memory is. And yet you forgot the suitcase, huh? I'm sorry Miss Winters, but you see when we got back to the... I see, all right. We're back to the reform kick, aren't we? I thought you give it that up. Or maybe you're just trying to protect my reputation from these fine gentlemen. Well, that is not necessary! Gentlemen, I drink. Not polite cocktails. I mean I drink! Excuse me ladies. I have several nets on shore. I want to make sure the storm hasn't damaged them. Just a minute professor. I think I'd enjoy talking to some shellfish. May I say that you surprise me, Miss Winters. Sure, go ahead and say it. It amazes me that a woman like you should be attracted by a man like that. And what exactly do you mean by a man like that? Mr. average all American, with wings. You should know Miss Winters, muscles, and a little bit of suntan don't make a man. And what does? An egghead with a microscope? In my humble opinion, Yes. If you take my advice, you're tire... If you take my advice, you keep your nose out of my affairs. You misunderstand me completely. I'm merely pointing out that trail strength is never a physical thing. Knowledge is strength. Self-discipline, the ability to channel... Ohhh. My mistake. I should have realized self-discipline is not just strong. Our self-control for that matter Our body in no brain. Who are you? Typical reaction. What makes you so superior, you little tin god? Stupid! Drunk! Stay away from me. I'm warning you! Wooping right along with our show, here Alina Elis. ♪ It's so wonder. ♪ Oh, no you can't it have anymore. You drink to much. Look at you, you don't even see straight anymore. Risks this for Laura. Because Laura needs it. She really needs it. It's Laura's medicine. Everybody tries to take her medicine away from her. They wouldn't want to take it away if it was penicillin. Laura reminds him. And Streptomycin. [inaudible] Laura is gonna take the medicine back to the tent with the light in case of fever gets worse at night. OK boys. Follow me. Be dead my little loveless. The wind must carry it here. That means that I must die too. I told you that something fantastic's going on here! That they are. Come on. See? Amazing. I've never seen something like it. That's funny, I thought you'd know all about this. Scientists certainly do not claim to know everything. Only Quacks do. But what you are about to do is extremely dangerous. How do you know? I would guess at these fish have been destroyed by some microscopic parasite. There's a possibility the same parasite could be transferred to your body if you should touch them. Could there be some connection between these and that skeleton that was washed up? Now let's not jump to conclusions, Mr. Murdoch. Face facts, professor. We stumbled onto a living horror! Emotionalism is a poor ally, Mr. Murdoch. - We must keep... - There's only one thing we must do, that's fly straight to the authorities with the facts and let them take over. Hey you two wake up! What is it? Get dressed fast. We're leaving! I want you both ready in 10 minutes. All right. Laura, let's... Oh. Oh... Oh... General, I've got rotten, it was clear. One of our aircraft is missing. No, it can't be. Even she wouldn't be dumb enough to do stuff like this. Perhaps not dumb enough but drunk enough. Of course that's what happened. She got good drunk. Then she thought the ocean was her bathtub. She decided to sail our little plane in it. I'll kill her! I'll kill the idiot! I don't remember doing it. I swear I don't. Of course you don't remember. How the devil could you? You were probably blind drunk. We... I... I remember falling down on the beach. Maybe I could remember what happened. Maybe the whole thing will come back to me. I only have to think! Well, think about this. The professor and I discovered the beach covered with fish skeletons. Skeletons, just like that poor devil we found yesterday. What happened? What is it? I'll tell you what it is. There's something weird out in that water, or something that eats the skin right of you. And now we are stuck here because your drunken friend dumped the plane! Oh no, Grant. Laura's never done anything insane like that, Not even when she was... drunk. Don't waste your breath honey. The plane is gone and I admit being in it last night. So what else can we expect the bird man to think? He'd hang his own mother on evidence like that. I couldn't have stated the case better myself. That wasn't very fair of him. Actually, it's quite possible that the wind blew the plane out of the sea. That's right Laura. It could have happened like that. Oh, sure! And the rope just happened to be in my hand. And I got blown out to sea with the plane. And right now, I'm under 500 feet of ocean. Why don't you both live me alone? What is it? Fish skeleton? I only wish it were. For the name of God, man. What is it? It's my case. Is magic! Pure distilled magic! I don't know, but certain it's something that's never been recorded. It's alive, don't is it? Yes, it seems alive. One thing is sure. They have part of man and a fish. Look out there! Millions of them, just waiting for us. Oh God. It's Laura! This is weird. What is it? - Ah! - Hold it! Don't move! Stay very still. That shiny stuff is bad medicine. All right. Now stand up. I can't. I almost slipped. You've got to. There is no other way. - No. - I said get on your feet! Good. All right, just step over to me. I'll fall! No you won't. I'll brace you. Now grab hold of my hands. Why did they stop? They can't keep their balance slowly. No, I can't! All right. All right. Then move back, so I can come over and get you. I can't! You're going to move back or you're going to die out here. I'll try. Go ahead. That's it. That's as far as I can go. Now, whatever you do don't grab me and panic, or we're both falling into that stuff. Stay calm. It's not over yet, Miss Letterman. Ah! Oh. What is it? Nothing Don't touch your pants. I need bandages, strips of cloth, anything, quickly! Hurry up! There. We can bandage it later. Good girl. Are you feeling better now, Miss Winters? I'm all right. It's not easy for me to do, but I want to thank you. Skip it. - No, I pay my debts. - I said skip it! Jana, as soon as we get back, I want to write it out of the books. Make out a check for Murdock for $1000. - I'll can do it. - I like the way you do business. Just a moment Mr Murdock. Do you happen to have your cigarettes with you? What's he doing? I have collected you specimens. Now we can perform some basic tests with it. I think you might be able to find a way to handle this stuff. Well, I can't be sure. I have only the barest of equipment with me, but perhaps we'd be luck. We may find some quite simple means of controlling them. After all these possess intelligence. They do not. Of course you understand the important thing for us to learn is just how we can... Do you understand what it means? These things want flesh, any kind of flesh. And once they sense it, they will it their waste or anything that comes between them and their meet. And we're supposed to just wait here until that stuff comes up and picks all our bones, naturally. Well, not at all, Miss Winters. Tomorrow morning my supply boat will arrive from the mainland. - Wow! - Oh. Yes it comes twice a week. All you've to do is wait and keep away from the water. I'm going to draw a line to indicate the high tide line. Since we are never sure where these saber creatures might sudden appear we must never step beyond this line. Not for anything! Shhhh! What is it? A martian hymn? Great! We can use this boy! Hey! Hey there friend! Come right on in and rescue this poor unhappy band of travelers. Will you keep quiet? You shut up! This guy's gonna ferry us out. Come on. It's is plenty to eat for you, so full sailing ahead! Are you trying to have that man killed? Mr Gunga Din, Stop playing hero! That guy's safe as long he's not by the water. Perhaps it's just a bunch of toothpaste tied together with a string. If he peddles into these flesh eaters, he's had it. Is that what you want? When you stop arguing, let's do something about it. Hey, go back! Get away from here! You must keep away! Hey, hey! I think you over loved it! You're really with me! I mean, you know the truth when it comes sailing in. No, no! don't come! I'm coming, my people! I'm coming! - He can't hear us. What do we do? - It's no use. I don't think he is already coming soon. Hey, don't quit now. Keep the love coming to me. I mean, just don't quit. Listen you fool. You're in danger! You're in danger! Man, you're so right! We're all in great things! Will you listen to me? Will you open your ears and listen to me? Give me the words. I'm a big man for the word. Speaking or writing or singing or painting, I'm all in the word. But man, that kind of word! Will you shut up? Shut that big mouth of yours before you wind up stardust. Let's drive up Max. I don't feel welcome anymore. You're not offending anymore my people! You've come too close to shore to turn back now. You better listen me closely. There is something in that water that eats flesh! I said eats flesh! People wiped down to the bone! Where is the lot, Mac? Don't tell me about that hunt, Jeff. These things are small and silvery. Right there, is a bubble. Get the geek! The geek! Get away from me! Get away! I told 'em. I told 'em that love was the only weapon but they don't listen. Now the geek is here and wants to take me first. Because I know about the weapon. Cut that off! Get out and start paddling that raft to shore. I'm not afraid, Max. The geek can't get me. Not Omar. Omar's got the love whip. Never mind, man. Just get in here, will you? Hey! Stop! Stop! Don't move, my friend! Don't move a step! What is it? That's not the weapon, man. Love is the weapon. Shut up and hold still! What a bad show, Max. It took me three weeks to make those sandals. I mean, they had the love and they were stitch. Look, lover. I want to show you something. What's the geek, Mac? Don't squeeze my muscle. That's my playing arm. I just want to show you what could happen to you. Man... what a way to go... You mean that silver stuff ate all that meat off them bones? Yep. Boy... that's one lovely appetite. Say... what makes them do it? I think they want the world the hate them. They want to be punished because of some guilt complex? Hey! Do you think maybe they just cookie? I do not know the conventional sinner for this word. "Cookie". But I wouldn't impute any in erotic tries to such a lower life. You're crazy man! You speak the word. Lay on me some more with that neurotic drive jazz. And let me have a little of old motivation music. - Sing me some more. - Please. Now they are all here. Dr. Cyclops, Gunga Din and now Buster Beatnik. Oh heaven protect a simple lady lush in a place like this. After you on the coffee, please. And, by the way, we are not casting any Brigitte Bar dot today. Thank you. I'm sorry, but you know what happened to my blouse, and I didn't have anything else with me. Well, don't worry about it. I'll get you something of mine to wear. You know what your trouble is, of course. No Omar. What is my trouble of course? You got a sour liver. Yes, that's right. Too much meat, too much sugar, spices, coffee, white bread, alcohol, onions and sex. Well I can do without all those other things, doctor, but you can't expect me to give up onions. I'll start to clean up. Oh please don't trouble Miss Jan. That's really nothing to do there. Hold it a minute, professor. There's still a little nourishment left in there. - How about taking a stroll? - I'd love to. Oh, but you think it's safe? As long as we stay among. Don't worry. I'll take good care of you. Oh Jan, wait a minute. I found something for you to put on. That's awfully considerate, Miss Winters. I'm sure it'll go just fine with her slacks, when she gets back. Sorry madly friend, but I am not going to be your dinner. I met a sweet innocent flower down in Texas near the end of the war. Te whole thing only lasted ten days, including the three day pass for our honeymoon. Then what? Then nothing. I went overseas, flew dozen of missions, and the war ended. Which was a break for me, but not for her. It turned out that this sweet innocent southern belle had already had two other husbands in the Air Corps. Oh, no Grant! Oh, yes. Two tail gunners who never made it back. You see, she was in business. At 10,000 dollars worth of GI insurance per tail guy. By the end, she confessed that she had been a little in love with me, or else she'd never married a pilot. They came back more often than tail gunners did. But that was years ago. You must have had time to get over. I guess so. Only sometimes I'm not so sure. You see, I actually loved that little tramp. Looks like even the birds want no part of this place. You know that's true. We've seen very little wildlife since we've been in this island. It's the last we're gonna see. Afternoon Jen. Mike leave today to met you. I sure am, I slept 'til noon. Bad sleep? Fish don't wait. Look at you. You knew I and Ruth went down to Boston last night for out anniversary. This were running good up to ten o'clock. Oh, well. Tomorrow is another day Jem. We'll start up bright and early. The lord give each one of us just so many days. Waste one, you never get it back. Ruth and I almost didn't get back. You must have heard how the hurricane washed out most of the shore road Say, what about that College call out on Baker's Island. - You get through the blow all right? - Wouldn't know. You mean you haven't even gone out there today? You told me you'd make a special run. Told you I might. Our deal with him says we don't run there but Mondays and Thursdays. Thursday don't start 'till tomorrow. You've got about as much heart as a hammerhead shark. You've got a lot to learn about business, boy. Hey, where are you going? Well, how do you think I'm going? What the devil is it? So, that's it. So, that's what? I've never seen one this big before but my guess is this is the granddaddy of all solar batteries Solar batteries? Each one of these disks contains maybe 100 cells, which convert light into electricity A gadget of this size could supply enough juice to barbecue Brooklyn. I wonder what Bartell's doing with all this power. Actually I have no use for that much power. Speak of the devil. Where'd you come from. From the tent. I've been looking all over for you. I've something quite interesting to show you. If you will follow me. I've already found something that interests me. What, this? What are you doing with 10,000 volts of electricity? Clearly I must insist that we start back at once. Of course I can idly tell y'all about my fabulous toy along the way. You see, a colleague of mine at the university, Dr. Martin has been developing the unit for several years now. And by the proficiency... And now that we're all together, our experiment begins. Let's get on with your test, professor. Very well, I believe we may have our weapon... See? I told you there's a weapon. I'm not referring to love, Omar. Electricity. You mean you think you'll be able to shock these things to death? The theory is unimportant. It's a test that counts. I don't know, whether 10,000 volts is enough to kill them. But I do know it can kill me. I think I've done it, professor. Yes. I think I have. Did you see that? Ha! He gave the thing the hot sit! Congratulations, professor! OK, now everybody start packing. Not quite yet, Miss Winters. There's still much to do. Look. Here is the solar battery. We run an extension cable down to the beach. There we place two single wires, There's an electrode in each end. Positive and negative. Once it hits the water, 10,000 volts will coarse through the flesh eaters, so... Well it makes sense, but what can we use for electrodes? The [inaudible] that's a perfect. You and Omar get the solar battery cable down to the beach. And outer the two reels of wire behind the tent. What about you, professor? I'd be along as soon as I put away some of the equipment. Okay Omar, let's go. Listen, how heavy are those reels? I'm not to big to this hard work jazz. Destroys initiative. Time, two minutes 20 seconds following 10,000 volts shock Specimens appear lifeless. Time 54 minutes, 55 seconds. Still no observable change. What is it? What could have gone wrong? I used to much voltage. That's it! That's it. It's our supply boat. It came dam early! Well he's a day late, as far as I'm concerned. Stupid Full! Luck out, you're heading straight to'em! Turn that thing away! They just plucked him like a chicken. Oh, I'm scare Grant. Now I'm really scare. You're not the only one, honey. All right Gunga Din, now what we do? They're sure to send another boat to investigate. Man, when they find that pile of bones of that launch, nobody's gonna try sailing in here again. Then we just hope we can get out on what's left of that raft of yours. Come on. We have a lot of work to do. Professor. - Did you see... - Not all, but enough. I was in the tent when I heard the screams. By the time I got outside, well.. Poor guy. You seriously think we can shoot 10,000 Volts of electricity though the entire ocean? Of course not. We'll use just a small strip of shore. But let's look for a less contaminated area. We'll circle the island. You and the ladies go that way. Omar and I'll go this way. We'll meet on the other side. OK. It's a date, but let's get moving! If you get the ice, I'll start the drinks. - The ice box is back there. - OK! Yahoo! - I got the rock. - Ah good. Splendid! Hand them over. The drink's almost ready. Crazy. - You're taking it straight. - Oh, yes Well, here's to life. I'll drink to that. - Hey, you've got the jar covered. - Just laboratory procedure. I'm a man of habit. Even on a desert island. You know, for a second there I thought maybe you covered it out of respect to those things you killed. Pretty cooky idea, hum? Yes, very cooky. And now we drink. Man, I hit the loving spot. It's funny... I once wanted to be a scientist. - Really, what field? - Nuclear physics. Ah, I thought it'd be a boot smashing them stupid atoms. Huh. Why didn't you continue. Man, I was all for it. They wanted me to cram my skull full of differential calculus, and quantum theories and all that jazz. You can get an adding machine to do that stuff. All I wanted to do is put some old atoms... But, what is it, my friend? You seem in pain. Or nothing. Little indigestion, I guess. I'm gonna have to give up beans. Of course that's not gonna leave me much else to eat. I already gave up meat and bread and sugar and... They're coming inside me! Keeping it in my mount. This spot doesn't look too bad. Great. Let's tell the professor. Listen. I told you I heard a scream. What happened, Bar tell. He slipped away from me. I warned him, but he wouldn't listen. He was only interested in saving himself. Listen to those screams, they're eating him alive. - It's all over now. - I'm glad he's dead. He's better off. Yes, that's right. He's lucky. He doesn't have to wait to die. It's over for him. All right. Cut that out. We can't afford any hysterics. Frankly Mr. Murdock, it does begin to look a little hopeless. Now, without even a raft... We can build a raft. Grant's right. Nothing really changed for us. If we can kill the flesh eaters we can still escape. Count me out. We'll all end up the way we did. The only difference is you'll break your back stringing the stupid wire. I'm going back to the tent. Alright. We'll wake you when it's all over. Professor, we found a stretch of beach that looks like a better bet than this one. - It's on the other side of the island. - No! It's more logical to make the test right here. If we are successful, we can always move the equipment to the other side. Agree? You're the expert. I want to cover a good sized area. You two layer out all the cable in that direction. I'll take the other layer and go this way. Well, how's it going, professor? Please Miss Winters, it's hard that this work is tiring. If you come to make jokes about it... I can help you, Peter. Oh, you've changed your mind? Yes. About several things. Well them. Suppose you begin by placing the wire in a straight line as I unroll it. Straight line, Miss Winters, please. We cannot afford to waste any wire. You know, I was thinking about what you said last night about... intellect and what it takes to really make a man. What is your point? I mean, take this fellow Murdock I mean, if it were up to him, we'd all have gone wading into the flesh eaters, waving a flag and singing the air force anthem. But then take yourself. Calm, observant... working everything out in a logical fashion. - So? - Oh look, Peter. Let's not beat around the bush. If there's anyone who's going to come out of this thing alive, it's you. And I want to be on your side. Really? But what makes you think that I have any special magic witch could save the two of us? OK. I'll lay my cards on the table. I know that you know more about this creatures than you're willing to tell. - You think that? - I know it, Peter. I took a peek under the sheet covering the specimens. They're alive, Peter. And as frisky as they come. I see. And what makes you think that I was aware that they'd come back to live? Oh. Come on Peter. You don't have to be afraid of me. I don't care what you're up to. It must be something important, I know that. And I know you must have thought it all out on the go. You're very practical, Laura. And very exciting. Even the smell of you is exciting. Come. Let's get out of this sun. Let's find a bit of shade. We'll discuss it better further. It still doesn't make sense, Grant. Why should Bar tell want to keep us believing? I don't know. But if he doesn't want to, might be takers out of wearing the clear side of the island where we'd have a better chance. Maybe he's right. Maybe it would have been a waste to carry these heavy reels over there if it's not going to work. Honey, if it's not going to work, then everything is a waste. But it's not the only question he's going to have to answer. And he'd better have the answers. Be more specific Mr. Murdock. What is it that bothers you? Why have you suddenly become so suspicious of my every move? Wait a minute, professor. Why is there so much to explain? You've got answers to all the questions. But why are there so many questions? Because our friend murder has an ugly mind, I'm afraid. Oh, yes? Well I'm afraid I'm getting ugly minded too. Bar tell, where were you last night when Laura went out of the plane? That's one I must have slipped up on. Good girl! OK, professor. Where were you? - I must have been asleep. - Not for quite a while. We shared that blanket shelter, remember? I woke up when you crawled in. It was hours after you walked down to the beach. Look, this is ridiculous. Next you'll accuse me of stealing the Empire State Building at higher noon. Perhaps without my identity too. Here, let me show you my university credentials. Well Mr. Murdock, do you honor my credentials? What the devil you are up to? Oh, it's simple enough. But while I explain. You splash the electro leads to the power lines, Mr. Murdock. ...then in 1947, the United States government Sent me to Germany in a top secret project, because of my knowledge of the language. With other scientists I was asked to inspect papers left behind by the Nazi war scientists. Yeah, I'll bet you enjoyed reading about those insane experiments. Packing living men in ice, draining their blood to find the precise threshold of death. Nice constructive work. Really Mr. Murdock? Is it too much more pleasant to die from the atomic bomb than from a hypodermic needle? OK. Cut the philosophy! Go on with your story. The Nazi marine biologists had indeed done some interesting work. Very creative work. - The flesh eaters? - Precisely. The German biochemist had been investigating the mystery of the virus. Strange phenomenon which is neither living nor dead, when he accidentally created a new life form. It had a most peculiar metabolism, It would consume only one form of nourishment. Living matter! You see the unique properties of this laboratory creation... Stop That instantly! You will not unwrap the second power lead until the first splash. Did you think I would be fool enough to let you throw a live power line in my face? Where was that? Oh, Yes! About the biochemists. A very low order of science Well, they're almost as stupid as airplane pilots. However, the Nazi marine biologists, soon saw what an enormous economic weapon they had here. Even a small amount of these creatures could wipe out the entire fish supply of North America. To say nothing about the people. Yes, well, a submarine was to drop to the test tube into the waters of southern cost of Florida. - Than, why didn't it work? - Who knows? Or possible the timing device for this fantastic creation of science misfired. And the cork was never popped from the tube. Not until many years later. What did Washington do about your report? There was no report. The Nazis had burned most of the papers. A poor underpaid marine biologist named Peter Bar tell burned the rest. Wasn't that clever of me? Back in America, I waited very patiently I carefully read all the marine publications. Finally in 1950, the Florida authorities reported the strange destruction of millions of fish. A second such catastrophe took place off Georgia in 1952. Later, the Carolinas reported similar disasters. Soon I was able to diagram the precise cost of our protein needs. But I still don't see how you plan to make money from these things. Don't you get it? He's gonna take them to some water department somewhere. Think what the monsters would do in the water supply of New York or Chicago. Mr. Murdoch, you underestimate my patriotism. Of course I will offer our own government first bid. However, if Russia, Britain or Germany should happen to bid more... Well... I'm not a super patriot. No you're not. But I'll tell you what you are. - You're a dirty sadistic... - Shut up! And now, Mr. Murdock you will throw the first electrode into the water. Get moving. How's killing those things going to help you? You still don't understand. The electric shock I gave the sample creatures in the tent merely stunned them. Once I repeat the process here, I can safely place the quantity of them in special containers... You mean the things in the tent came back to life? Of course. I'm sorry you didn't see the final result of my experiment. Miss Winters did, however. Laura? Where is she? I'm afraid Miss Winters will not be able to join us. The great lady has taken her final round. You. You killed her! You cannot killed us right from the start. No. I'd hoped you would fly from my island before the fish skeletons began to show up. But it was not to be. Why didn't you kill us, then? I'd good use for you, as you will see. And now you'll throw the electrode into the water. But this time, no useless heroics. Good. And now you'll do the same with the other electrode. And your job will be almost done. Almost? After we have electrified the water, It'll be necessary to test it. To see if all the flesh eaters have been sufficiently stunned. And so you, Mr. Murdock will lie down in a the contaminated area... You... animal! You will lie down in one of the contaminated areas, and be our guinea pig Alright. In the meantime Miss Letterman, you'll go out the tent and bring back the lead cylinders that will serve to store our monsters. - Isn't there anything... - I'm afraid not, honey. Go on. Let us proceed. The moment the other electrode hits the water, the circuit will be complete. They won't die! Don't electrify those things! Go, Mr. Murdock! Now! No! Stop! Oh my God. No. You don't know what you've done. What are you talking about? You created a monster! Something beyond belief. Easy Jan, Easy. Take a deep breath and tell us all about it. It was huge, slime, bloated thing. And the table was covered with blood. The smell, Grant. A horrible stench. It's preposterous. I know enough about the flesh eaters to realize... Preposterous, Martel? OK, suppose you give us an answer for this thing. A nucleus... A charge of energy bound the amino acids together... and ended forming this. Can't be destroyed. And just masters this. Some kind of tissue... The bullet can penetrate it. It stopped. It's just waiting for us down there. Oh, no. It's going to climb up. Lets keep running. Fools! You can't escape by running! Have you forgotten that at this very moment the sea is giving birth to a creature 100 times the size of this one? Never mind, I'll still have the final victory. I will cheat the flesh eater with the only weapon I have left. Our lives. You'll die first, Bar tell. You'll die first! Do you want to eat? You want to eat? Here! Eat! What destroyed it? I don't know, but I'm gonna find out. You won't need this. You fired the last shell. Grant... What was it? Whole body. The flesh hasn't even been touched. Now I know how it was killed! How? - You mean we have a chance? - What killed it? Blood. Laura's blood. It drips straight to the nucleus. Yes, I see. Hemoglobin sensitivity. The fish skeletons were washed up in a pool of blood. And the bird cage was covered with blood. Right! The silver things rejected it, but the nucleus was super sensitive to it enough to die from a direct injection of it. Then we can defeat the other one. Exactly, but only if we use our own blood, shot right into the heart of it. We've got to rig up some kind of giant hypodermic needle. Yes, but we've got to hurry. That monstrous thing is forming in the water right now. There. That should do it. This blade will pierce the eye, and then... I will have to puncture each of us a number of times to extract a sufficient supply. Well, let's get started. The beaker, Miss Letterman. I only hope that suit will protect you from the silver things long enough for you kill the monster. Thanks. Let's hope it does just that. Grant. Don't worry. - Are you coming, Bar tell? - In a moment. In just a moment. Grant, he got the gun! Too bad, Miss Letterman. I would have preferred to finish the job without force. Now what, Bar tell? Now I save myself from the electric chair for two murders. Oh! What is it the Arabs say? Where there is no witness, there is no crime. OK. You still want the run this show? Go out and take care of that monster yourself. I think not. I don't believe you'd care to watch Miss Letterman die. No!
