NEW MOON "These violent delights have violent ends." "And in their triumph die, like fire and powder." "Which, as they kiss, consume." Gran? Edward, don't, she'll see you. Okay. Gran, I'd like you to meet... Happy birthday, Bella. Happy birthday. I thought we agreed, no presents. The one from me's not wrapped. So it doesn't count. That's actually great. Thanks, Dad. It goes with this one from your mom. We coordinated. Well, she coordinated me. It's to put your pictures in from senior year. Senior year. How'd you get so old so fast? I didn't. It's not that old. I don't know. Is that a gray hair? No. No way. Happy birthday. That's really funny. Another missing hiker brings the total to three presumed dead. Rangers are searching for the killer animal. It's Bella. Bella! Hi! Today's the big day, Bella. R and J essay due. Oh yeah. Wherefore art thou, Bella? Let me take a picture of you guys. My mom... wants me to put together a scrapbook full of memories. - Cool. Yeah. - I take 'em. I'm not in 'em. No, come here. - You'll photoshop this if my nose looks big, right? Don't worry, I'm in the picture. No one will be looking at you guys. That's good. Oh, good. Cullen's here. Yay. Talk to you later. - Happy birthday. - Don't remind me. Bell, your birth is definitely something to celebrate. Yeah, but my aging's not. Your aging? I think 18 is a little young to start worrying about that. It's one year older than you. No, it isn't. I'm 109. Maybe I shouldn't be dating such an old man. It's gross. I should be thoroughly repulsed. We have to go to class. Okay. Wait a second. Someone wants you. Bella! Jacob! I'll leave you to talk. Hello, Biceps! You know, anabolic steroids are really bad for you. I'm just filling out, Bella. It wouldn't seem so drastic if we hung out more. You should switch schools. You can come hang out with the palefaces. I'm all right. I prefer the rez school's exclusivity. They let any old riff-raff into this place. I see. Then why are you slumming it'? I was just buying a part for the Rabbit. You should really come take a ride when it's done. Is it fast? It's decent. - You're kidding. - Okay. Good. Hey, happy birthday. Your dad told my dad, so... Yeah, of course, he did. I saw this the other day and thought of you. Catches bad dreams. That's kinda perfect. Thank you. No problem. - Good seeing you. - Yeah, I'll see you later. So how come Jacob Black gets to give you a gift and I don't? Cause I have nothing to give back to you. Bella, you give me everything just by breathing. Gee? Thank you. That's all I want Bella! Happy birthday! I thought I said no presents? I've already seen you open it and guess what? You love it. You're gonna wear it tonight. Our place. Come on. Please? It'll be fun. - Okay. All right. - Great! I'll see you at seven. Jasper! No fair with the mood control thing. Sorry, Bella. Happy... Never mind. You can't trust vampires. Trust me. "Oh my love. My wife." "Death, that hath sucked the honey of thy breath..." "but hath no power yet upon thy beauty." "Thou art not conquered." "Beauty's ensign yet is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks." "Death's pale flag is not advanced there." I hate being celebrated. There are worse tragedies. Look at Romeo. Killed his true love out of sheer stupidity. But I do envy him one thing. Juliet. That's perfect. If you like that obviously beautiful sort of thing. Not the girl. The suicide. It's nearly impossible for... for some... people. For humans, a little poison... a dagger to the heart. There're so many different options. Why would you say that? 'Cause I had to consider it once. I didn't know if I'd get to you in time. I had to come up with some kind of plan. What was the plan? That I'd go to Italy and provoke the Volturi. The what? The Volturi. Now, who'd like to repeat the last few lines of iambic pentameter... just to show they were paying attention? Mr. Cullen? Yes, Mr. Berty. "O here..." "will I set up my everlasting rest..." "and shake the yoke of inauspicious stars from this world-wearied flesh." "Eyes, look your last." "Arms, take your last embrace." "And lips, O you the doors of breath..." "seal with a righteous kiss a dateless bargain to engrossing death." Eyes on the screen, people. "Thus, with a kiss, I die." The Volturi are a very old very powerful family. I guess they're the closest thing to royalty my world has. Is that Carlisle? Yeah. He lived with them for a few decades. Described 'em as very refined. No respect for human life, of course. But a respect for the arts and the sciences, at least. And the law. Above all, the law. Vampires have laws? Not very many. And only one that's regularly enforced. What is it? That we keep the existence of our kind a secret. We don't make spectacles of ourselves. And we don't kill conspicuously. Unless, of course, you want to die. You gotta stop talking about that. I can't even think about someone hurting you. Bella... the only thing that can hurt me is you. And I don't have anything else to be afraid of. That's not true. Victoria? She'll come for me one day. Alice will see when she decides... and we'll be ready. I cou
