Your brother, Mansei Lee, disappeared while trying to infiltrate a Japanese drug smuggling group. Your brother's an undercover narcotics agent with the Hong Kong Police. He was sent to Japan to conduct an investigation on Central Trader. Central Trader? It's one of the largest drug smuggling groups in Japan, protected by a group of brutal martial arts experts. - You mean my brother is...? - We don't know yet. We have another agent working there, but we've lost contact with her. If we could contact her, we could find out if your brother is alive and uncover the drug smuggling route. Your mother is Japanese, which means you have some Japanese blood. You even have relatives in Yokohama. Moreover, you're the only person I can think of who's capable of doing this job. I know this is a very difficult job... Will you accept it? This is our agent, Fang Shing. The meeting place is Club Mandarin in Yokohama. Eight o'clock on the third Saturday of the month. The signal is... a rose. YOKOHAMA Welcome! Welcome. - What can I get you? - Spaghetti. - One spaghetti! - Hey, cutie. Fancy going out? Let us show you a good time. Come on! You bitch! You bitch! Koryu! - Leave this to me. - Jiro! - Here you go... - Bastard! I see. You're still the tomboy I remember. You must be hungry after all that exercise. Eat up! Well, it's a good thing you didn't get hurt. Anyway, Koryu, you look so grown up. I almost didn't recognize you. You're quite famous in Japan as Hong Kong's Martial Arts Champion. Koryu, please give me a lesson one of these days. Reiko, don't be so bold. You're only a beginner. Stop it, you two! They're always like this. I guess it's in their blood. They're just like their cousins, you and Mansei. I wonder where Mansei is. I did everything I could to find him. But as I told you before, I found nothing. I hope he's alive. Don't worry, Uncle. My brother's a very talented fighter. Even if someone is after him, he's not an easy target. I'll find him no matter what. Here you are. Fang... why did you leave the boss's house without permission? We suspected you were a spy. Come on! - Hey! - Come back here, bitch! Get her! - Come back here! - Stop! - You little bitch! - Fucking bitch! Don't make any trouble. Take her! Come on! Fang Shing... What the hell? Son of a bitch! Our boss doesn't accept mistakes. To make up for your screw-up, find Fang Shing and kill her. Now that Mansei's sister from Hong Kong is here, the Tokyo Shorinji School that Mansei belongs to will get involved. The guy who took Fang Shing may be working for Fujita. Ah, Inubashiri... Enough! I heard you failed. Hayashi, why didn't you leave it to us? It would've irritated Fujita since you consider the Shorinji clan your enemy. Who cares? Even if it means selling my soul to the devil, I want to destroy the Shorinji clan with my own hands! Fujita disgraced me and I must clear my name in order to remain in the Japanese martial arts circle! Alright... this will be your first assignment. Check out Fujita and all of his aides. SHORINJI SCHOOL, TOKYO HEADMASTER - TETSUZO FUJITA Eyes closed! The art of Shorinji Kempo enhances the harmony of the body and the mind. Power and love are inseparable. Defense is paramount. First comes the defense, then comes the attack. Your strength and the love in your heart are one and the same. Use your strength and love to ground yourself. Remember the underlying philosophy is harmony between you and others. That means half for you and half for others. When others feel pain, you must feel that pain. This mutual prosperity is the basic spirit of the Embu, the exercise we are about to practice. Stand! First, Byakurenken. Ready! One, two, three! Four, five! Six, seven... Master, Lee's sister is here from Hong Kong. - Koryu is here? - Yes. So you are saying a large drug smuggling organization is behind Mansei's disappearance? Yes, sir. Some people say that Mansei was a drug addict and that he got killed while working for the organization. My brother is innocent. I too believe in your brother's humanity. How can I say this? I have developed great faith in him through our martial arts training. He just won the title to represent the Tokyo region at the Shorinji National Championships. I remember him talking about you in Hong Kong. I think it was the day before he disappeared. He said he was hoping you would get married and live an ordinary life. He cared a great deal about you. He was a narcotics agent for the Hong Kong Police. A narcotics agent? And what are the police's intentions now? Well... ...they can't do anything yet, since there's no evidence. Koryu... do not worry. Even if the police aren't helping, the Shorinji won't give up on him. We'll find your brother, believe me. There's a young girl here as crazy about Shorinji as you are. She's called Emi Hayakawa. That's her there. She's about your age. I think you two will get along well. Master, who's that? That's Hibiki. Son of my late friend Rintaro Hibiki, who was a genius at Shorinji. He's ex-captain of a university karate club. Ex-car racer, and ex-bodyguard to an ambassador. Interesting fellow. He's leading an unconventional life, like his father did. Actually, I've secretly asked him to search for your brother. Right. That's it for today. Thank you. Hibiki! This is Mansei's younger sister. Where did you take Fang Shing? I took her to a safe place. Don't worry. Where? The Shinobu Kojo Ballet Studio, which my girlfriend owns. 3RD FLOOR: SHINOBU KOJO BALLET STUDIO Fang Shing, is my brother alive? Or has he been killed? I don't know. He sneaked into Kakuzaki's basement, searching for evidence. That's too risky! He was frustrated. We haven't got anything on Kakuzaki. But more and more heroin is coming into Japan. Mansei couldn't wait any longer, so he risked his life... What's the matter, Fang Shing? You're not as into it as usual. I'm getting bored with TV shows recently. But I'll show you a good action movie. SPINGEL: SOSHIN-RYU MARTIAL ARTS That was the last I saw of Mansei. Koryu... This is Mansei's. I found it in the basement. Fang Shing! What is it? Are you OK? Drugs... I need drugs! Drugs? Fang Shing! Fang Shing! It's Kakuzaki. He forced me to take the drugs. Fang Shing! Give me the woman you took in for Hibiki. How dare you! You have no business here. Shut up! Stop! Out of the way. SHINOBU KOJO: RYUKYU KOJO-RYU KARATE TETTOSO: TAKASAGO-RYU BLOWGUN Fang Shing! Koryu! Please let me know if there's anything I can do. I'll do anything to help Mansei. Emi... I was his Shorinji student. Four years ago, when some gang members tried to rape me, your brother rescued me. That's how I got into Shorinji. I see. - I'm glad to have met you. - Me too. A locket of hair?

Have you found Mansei's sister from Hong Kong yet? She hasn't shown up at Gyokudo's restaurant in Yokohama. Perhaps she's hiding at Fujita's Shorinji School in Tokyo. Not good enough! Fang Shing might've told her what we're doing. We must kill Koryu. Mr. Kakuzaki... Just look at those freaks. Why bother? You should've used me from the very beginning. It's none of your business. They're like my pets. Some rich men buy race horses or keep expensive dogs as pets. But I keep unusual humans instead of animals. It amuses me. Are you saying that I'm one of your pets? You win. You're still as sharp as ever. I killed fifty bulls with my bare hands in South America, you know. Inubashiri, just leave everything to me. Be my right-hand man and I'll give you the biggest martial arts school ever. Very well. I'll put my life in your hands. Take this money. It should last for a while. Boss, you can discuss anything with me. I'll show you how I do things around here. It should be quite interesting. I can see everything that's going on in the house from my room. He's my guinea pig. I've been trying all kinds of drugs on him. I've found that human beings can take quite a bit of heroin. Mansei Lee... You know him? Of course. He's one of the best students at the Shorinji School. I just injected him with 1.2 grams of heroin. That's almost a lethal dose. Well, we didn't have to go looking for her, did we? Hey, how did you get in? You're not allowed in here! Hey, hold it. You're coming with me! Hold it! I'm Inubashiri. I have been waiting for you. Since you'll be dying soon, I'll tell you this. Your brother is alive. He's in Kakuzaki's basement, and he's a wreck. So the lady dragon was no match for you after all. She was just a girl. The sharks must've eaten her by now. By the way, about the new martial arts school... Don't worry. I can make as much money as I want. I'll show you. These are the wigs that Central Trader imports from Hong Kong. This one's worth 300 million yen. 300 million? The hair comes from Southeast Asia with high-grade heroin sprinkled on it. That's the secret of Central Trader's rapid growth. I see... Excuse me, boss... He's here again, asking to see Mansei. Mr. Kakuzaki, would you please let me see him? - I can't stand to see him like that. - What do you mean? You're the one who asked me to spare his life. That's why I didn't kill him. Please, just this once. I just want to give him some homemade buns. See? KORYU WILL RESCUE YOU SOON. Please, boss. Please! You can beat me all you want. But please stop doing drug experiments on Mansei. I beg of you! Please! Silence! If you ever try to betray us again, I'll kill every member of your family! CENTRAL TRADER Out of the way! I'm gonna fill you with lead, bitch. Put the fire out! Put it out! Move it! Hurry! Koryu! Koryu? Shit... Emi! What? Koryu is alive! Are you sure? Inubashiri, the lady dragon just attacked our wig warehouse. You said you'd killed her! Impossible. You idiots! A whole truck load has gone up in flames! Boss, there can be no doubt that Fujita is helping Koryu. This is an opportunity to destroy both of them. It'll solve all our problems. Fujita, I'm here for the people who robbed the warehouse. - What are you talking about? - Koryu Lee and Emi Hayakawa! Listen, Fujita... What about all that spirit and discipline you always talk about? In reality, you let your people act like gangsters. You've gone too far, Inubashiri. What prestige? Huh? What tradition? If you won't hand those women over to me, then fight me! Hold it! I'll take you on. Hibiki! Let me take care of them. It'll give Shorinji a bad name if you fight such a lawless bunch. How dare you! Master! Inubashiri, go home and tell your master that the Tokyo School will take him on any time. Hibiki, you won't be promoted fighting like that. Gyokudo... call Koryu here. - Koryu? - That's right. Inubashiri is finished. Now it's your turn to be useful. I beg you, please don't kill her. I'll make sure she goes back to Hong Kong. I beg you. Koryu is hiding at Fujita's. Here. Call her right now. She's an enemy who knows our drug smuggling secrets. Here! They are both part of my family. I can't let Koryu suffer like Mansei. I just can't. - Not Koryu. Kill me instead. - Silence! If you want to disobey my orders, then fine. I'm sure you'll enjoy this, anyway. Reiko. Stop. Stop! Daddy! Help! Daddy... Please, boss. Please let my daughter go. Stop it! Daddy! Please help me. Please stop it. Give me back my daughter. Boss! Stop it! Let her go! Stop! Stop! I will... I will call Koryu. Oh, you will? You stubborn fool! Call her now! Hello? Oh, it's you, Uncle. What's the matter? My brother? I just received a call from Mansei. He said he's escaped. He's still in hiding... ...so meet him at the old factory in Harumi at three. - That was his message. - Right. At the old factory in Harumi at three. Understood. Brother! Koryu! You just walked into a trap. Emi? Has Koryu called yet? Not yet. It's not like her to leave the school without a word. Something must've happened. Father! Reiko! What happened to you? Father, Koryu is missing. Do you have any idea where she is? Koryu... I don't know. I don't know anything! Something's wrong with both of you. Tell me what happened. Nothing! Stop asking questions. What is it, Reiko? It's too late! Koryu must be dead by now. Daddy! Please tell them everything! You and Kakuzaki are... Kakuzaki? Father, what's going on? Mr. Gyokudo, please tell us everything. Well... - Father! - Mr. Gyokudo! Uncle! - Father! - Daddy! Father, hang in there. Koryu... - You're still alive? - Uncle... This must be a punishment for betraying you. I was... I was working for Kakuzaki's organization. I needed to borrow some money for the restaurant. And I got drawn in deeper and deeper. Uncle, do you know where my brother is? He is in the dungeon... - ...in Kakuzaki's basement. - The dungeon? Koryu... - Father! - Uncle! - Daddy! - Uncle! Let's go. Boss, all the wigs we received today have been stored in the basement. Make sure to re-enforce security around the house. Haven't you found anyone to kill the lady dragon yet? Actually, we have someone. Who is it? Akazawa, a former priest. Well, well. I hope you didn't come here to preach a sermon. Interesting. Let me see how much power it has. Try it on Mansei. I wonder if it'll crack his bones. Brother... Mansei, get up. Stand up! The boss has ordered you to fight. Come on, stand up! Walk! Brother, are you alright? Koryu. You again? Brother... Brother... Koryu. What have they done? Hang in there, Mansei. I got your locket. Koryu... The drugs have destroyed my body. Promise me... ...you'll destroy Kakuzaki's operation. Your efforts weren't wasted. That locket of hair helped uncover Kakuzaki's drug smuggling operation. Really? That's good. Koryu! Don't worry about me. Go! Brother... Brother... Well, well... People say you're a Shorinji expert, but look at you now. Everyone who opposes me goes to Hell. Now it's time for the invulnerable lady dragon to die. Just like her brother. After her! Go! Get her! Go! Well done, lady dragon. But unfortunately, you won't leave this house alive. Kill her! Go on! Hold it! Who the hell are you? Kakuzaki, now you have us to deal with. How convenient! I'll take care of all of you at once. Kill them all! Kenichi! - You OK, Koryu? - Yes. I told you to stay home. Girls slow men down. You useless trash! Koryu! I've got this under control. Go after him! Koryu... Now it's just you and me. Koryu! You dropped this. I know it's important to you. Koryu... Let her be. THE END
