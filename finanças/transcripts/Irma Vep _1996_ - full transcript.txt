I have to close the deal now. Over and above 5,700,000, you get 25% of the gross... until you recoup what you're owed. No way! Then the film is amortized including an overhead of seven percent, plus the 300,000 for the line producer. Yeah, he's paid too. What is it? Can't you see I'm busy? Yeah. It's an art movie, yeah. It's cultural, along the lines of- You'll have all the guarantees you need. No, there's no need to worry. He's a good director. You've heard of him. I don't know. I don't know who said so. I'm not authorized to negotiate the rent. Don't worry. There's no problem. No problem. They'll call you, stop by- I’ll ask a few questions. Let's try to keep this short. So, first name and last name. Height? Six feet. What have you done recently? I was in a show. I have the three guns. First door on the right. Is René in? No, he's out. Where's Maité? Scouting the sewers. Good morning. There. Hold on two seconds. Maité said to bring her here from the airport. Have her wait in Maité's office. Here. Good-bye. - Hello. - Hi. - She just got off a 12-hour flight! - I don't know. It's up to you. Why are you here? Maité said- Said what? To bring her here. Maité's out for the day! René has to see her. He's out too. Maybe he's coming. He said he wasn't. You're all so fucking incompetent! I’m sorry. Hello. Hf. Um, you wait here. Okay? Mm-hmm. I'll try to find Mr. Vidal. I'll just try. I don't know. Okay? Okay Thank you. Thanks. I’m up to my ass in work. Get your shit together. Can't you get organized? I’m sorry. He's very-A little nervous, but he's a nice man. The filming will start soon, and, uh, we have a big production. Yeah. But I know I’m late too. I’m sorry. I was supposed to be here three clays ago. - No, it's okay. - But, you know- The film in Hong Kong? It went over schedule for a whole week. One week, and- Yes. Yes. Uh, you want a chair? No, no, I'm fine. Thank you. Niama Films, good morning. Oh, you're the guy from the warehouse. I know something was decided, but I can't say what. I'm not authorized to- Are you with Maité? No. Is that her? Yeah, that's Maggie. Where's René? No one's here for her. It looks bad. Can I have another cigarette from you, please? Yeah, sure. Hi. Hello. Thank you. Extra light. Thanks. What was your film in Hong Kong? Oh, it was an action movie. You know, action? Fighting? Action. It was very violent. It was too violent. It was about Thai drug dealers. And you are a Thai drug dealer? Oh, no, no, no. I'm with the police. Um, actually, I'm a professional killer, and, uh, the police blackmailed me... and I had to infiltrate for them the drug dealers. And they found out, and I was in big trouble, and they tried to-Uhhh! You fight with them and- Yeah. But we didn't do a lot of fighting scenes. Mostly it's underwater. We did frogmen. Frogmen? You don't know- She said she was fighting frogmen. You know? Yes. It's complicated and boring and- You're not at René's yet? At René's? He's been waiting for an hour. No one told me. I left a message on your beeper. You didn't pick it up? Hello. I’m Mr. Desormeaux. We spoke on the phone. Yes. I’m the production manager. I’m sorry. There has been a complete misunderstanding. Mr. Vidal is waiting for you. I’ll take you now myself. Mm -hmm. Kevin will take your luggage to the hotel. Please. Bye. Bye-bye. What about our talk? I haven't forgotten you. Drop her stuff at the hotel. I’ll be right back. OKay. You arrived very late. I’m sorry, but the film in Hong Kong- I know. We have to do everything very fast now. You must try the costumes. You must go to the medical checkup. And also you have a rendezvous with the cameraman. This is why. This is the reason. You understand what I say? You want a beer? Yes, Ida. It's because I saw you in a very, very cheap cinema... in Marrakech. They showed this in Marrakech? Yeah. And you-you are like a dancer. And also like an acrobat. You know... and this scene is very, very beautiful... like floating in the air. Thank you. But, really, they were just done by stunts. You know, when the TV came to me and asked me to make... a remake of Les Vampires, I think they are out of their mind. Why ask me to do Les Vampires? Louis Feuillade did it in 1915. Very simple. Why to change? They insist. Then I think... not a French actress can be Irma Vep... after Musidora. It's impossible. It's blasphemy. But I tell them... maybe I have an idea, you know. Maybe I have an idea. You. You can be Irma Vep. Because you have the grace. I tell them I can do the film if you do the part. Big discussion. Everybody say to me, “Why you ask a Chinese actress? Why a Chinese actress?” But I am sure nobody else can do it... because I saw you in this film. You are mysterious like Irma Vep. You are beautiful like Irma Vep. And also, you are magic like her. And also, you are very strong. And it's very important you are modern. I want a modern Irma Vep. You understand what I say? I think so. You'll see. I’ll show you. And this is - She's Irma Vep. She has stolen in the hotel room the map of the treasure. The treasure is hidden in la forét de Fontainebleau. / stop the piano. That make me nervous. I like silence in silence movie. He is Moreno. He's a gangster too, but he is an enemy of the Vampire. You know, Vampires are not real vampires. They're a group of criminals who cal! themselves Vampires. And Irma is... the dream of those criminal, you know. The dream. She is the woman who inspires the Vampires. Now... Irma is prisoner of Moreno. ♪♪ ls it good? Well- Okay- C-Can you turn around, yes? Mm-hmm. Uh, now can you walk? Uh- Uh- Okay, uh, come. Come. Lt Bunche up here. Everywhere. Yeah. It's the right size though. So what do we do? We can take in the sleeves even more. There's not much else to do. It's crazy. We've already cut it and it still bunches up. We'll do it again. Don't get upset. I'm not upset. I need the line to be sleek. When she walks, it keeps bunching up. Uh, ifs not shiny enough. There's a spray for that. It's good, but not perfect, right? Can you come a little bit- Okay, um- It has to be incredibly feminine. That's the thing. Ahh! Voila! It's tight? Yes! Oh, I'm sorry-It has to be tight. You know? It has to be very tight. It's the idea of the costume, right? It's bondage costume. Okay? But you are sure this is what René wants? Oh, yes, of course. That's what he wants. Yeah? It's just completely different from what I imagined. No, no, no. Look at the photo he gave me. This is the idea of Irma Vep. [ Maggie 1 Mm-hmm. I say it's like hooker. But if he wants hooker, I say it's okay. So, now we are in a shop for hookers. You know? Yes. So that's it. And now I have to find the mask. Okay? Don't be worried. It will be very nice. No, no, I like it. Can I see the masks and hoods again? I want latex from head to toe. This is a double-layered mask. There are two zippers. When you unzip the one in front, you can see the face... with holes for the mouth and eyes. Not bad, huh? There was a simpler one. The one I showed you last time. This one. With the zipper, the mouth, the eyes- What if it doesn't work? Does it hug the face tight? You can tuck it into the collar of the catsuit. You want to try? Why not? Will you hold this? Freaky. How does it feel? Not bad. Not bad. And you-you went to see the-the fi-Batman, you know? Batman? Mmm. Yes, uh- No, not Batman for with all, you know- Catwoman? The return? The second one? Ah, yeah. Oh-Mmm. Y-Yeah. You liked it? No. I thought, you know what, it was completely crap. I just went because Rene said to me, “You have to go there to understand the film.” But I think it's a movie for the fans, you know. The first one was bad enough, right? Yes. I don't know why they'd make three. That's true. But I think Catwoman was all right. Yes, it's true. I like her too. She's nice. You know, I tell you everything, and then you can know me a lot. I mean- I don't like American films. No, they're- Right. I know what you mean. Y-Yes? I think everything is too much decoration, too much money. You agree with me? Sure. And all this money, this big money, big Dec- And they're so lucky to have so much money. Yes, but why? For what? For this? Or this? Nothing, you know. Excuse me. Can I borrow your salt? And the film of René? You like the film of René? Well, they don't show them in Hong Kong. Oh, yes, I can imagine that. Yeah. But he sent me two tapes and, you know, they had no subtitles. That was very difficult. Oh, yes? But you looked at the images? Yeah, well, I tried. But, actually, it seemed quite interesting. I liked it, you know. It's weird, but it's good. - You liked it? - Yeah. Well, that's why I'm here. Right? But this friend of mine in Hong Kong, he knows French cinema much better than me, and he said he used to be very good. Yes, exactly. He used to be very good. Before, he made good films, but now I-l really don't know what's happened. He has other thing in his mind, but I don't know what. So, the remake, uh, of Les Vampires-The Vam-Mm-hmm. The Vampires. The Vampires, Yeah. Maybe it will be good. I don't know. Maybe. I say maybe. But, you know, what's the point? Why do we do what's already been done? Why don't we do more personal films? Mm-hmm. You don't think so? I don't know. You don't know? DO you? Nah, but-but when he spoke to me he was very concerned... and he really believed in this film, you know. And that's nice. Well, yes, it's nice! It's nice, but I don't know about the film. Yes, yes. Yes, yes, yes. Maybe I have a- Maybe there is a dimension that I don't get, in fact. Yeah. Give him a chance. I’m doing too much. Yes. - It works real well. - Oh, yeah, yeah. Do you have a second? No. Maggie, can you come with me now, yes? Sure. Okay, because, you know, after, they will say we are late. And then- Okay. So it's good like that now? You feel better now? Yes. It's not so tight. Mm-hmm. And no more- Come on! We're waiting! I can take my time like everyone else! Not now! Let's go! Fuck off! So you see? You see how it is? Okay, you're away. We're coming down the corridor. I read you loud and clear. Me no English. Me German. You German? No. No German. Hi. Oh, the corset. It hurts me when I walk. You also? I'm getting used to it. Oh- You can-You can respirer? Breathe? Yes, breathe. You can breathe? Just about Maybe mine's not as tight. Yeah. Do you want one? No, no, no. Thank you. Because of the corset I can't breathe. SO. You know, it's very important to be simple. You don't play, you don't think about your part. You just be yourself. It's not so easy in this. No, no, no. It's like your mask for the whole body that make you absolutely free, right? You remember the actress in the Feuillade movie? Her name is Musidora. Musidora, a great actress. Because it's silent movie, all actress were very expressionist- you know, very dramatic. And Musidora- she has this very expressive display. She play completely modern, completely simple. So, we shoot in silent too. But it is not because it's silent... that you must try to play more. You must play less. You must respect the silence. Why did you tell her that? She's under hypnosis in the scene. I thought it was important. It's best to insist. I'm not sure she understands everything I say. Do you think she does? Can't you smoke outside? This is the third time! Are you deaf? Go smoke outside! We're shooting! You find it funny? No, no. You find this funny? Twenty-five takes and you're still laughing? It doesn't work. Help me, Zoé. Can? you put on a hood by yourself? What's wrong with the bonnet? Show me. We tried tons of times. The thing is, you have to stretch it out first. Yeah, give it a try. If you stretch it and pull it down fast, then it works. It worked before. But it's backwards. Not at all. I did it once and I got it right! Everyone, into position! Ever think about changing jobs? That take was no good for me. It was no good for anyone. Come here. The candelabra... down here... it wasn't too great. Make the sign up here. Ah? And put on the hood like I did-simply. He's laughing. It's no laughing matter. Is it okay now? Yeah, I’m done. Concentrate. Get back in the box. And let's forget this wax museum stuff How's it going? Are we on schedule? We're way behind. What? Will we wrap on time? I have no idea. Where's the stuntwoman? She's in wardrobe. What? Go get her! Okay. You promised me extra help. I know. I 070' all the packing up! We'll talk later! Not now! It's too late! Stop barking orders at me! We have to work in an orderly way! You’re just a tidiness freak! I certainly am! You keep things so tidy that your movies suck! It's the truth! You're part of the team. Not for much longer! Then pack your bags! Why should I be bossed around by watchdogs like you? Me, a watchdog? You can breathe down someone else's neck! Don't say things now that you'll regret later. I just want to do my job and fix up Laure's costume. You had time to do it before! Hands off, hands off. Let her fix up Laure's costume. I'll murder that bitch. Keep it under control. Listen to me! She's always the same! Say something. We worked. We 're entitled to your opinion. I couldn't even hear you breathe! Enough's enough! Fuck you! You want my opinion? It sucks. It's shit. It sucks! FUCK you! That was a barrel of laughs! He's worse than ever. What's the problem? Hurry up! The movie's at 10:00. Everyone left. Can I have a ride? Hurry, get in. Whoo! Zoé? Stop. Where's everybody? You have no car? No. I was on the telephone inside, and when I came out, everybody's gone. Oh. Uh, I can take you with me on my bike, but, uh, it will be a little bit, uh, acrobatic. That's okay. You must never tell Desormeaux that I took you with me on my bike, because if not, he kills me. I cross my heart. Thanks! There! It's here? Yes, it's here. Can you help me to take the bike? Sure. Thank you. Here. Okay. Thanks. Whoo! It's cold! You can go up. It's the stairs at the first floor. Okay. Should I take a right? Yes, yes. Of course. Oh. Finally! I know, we're late. After the rushes, René had a shit fit. I brought Maggie, okay? No problem. She's the Chinese actress. She speaks no French. Oh. Welcome. Thank you. What about Markus? Where's Markus? Hello. He's not here yet? He'll be late. He got in a fight with René. No. I bet they're still screaming away. Oh. Roland and Maurice are here. Uh- Do you want to drink something? I’ll have a whiskey. The same. Thank you. Hi there. You're watching this? Sorry. Meet Maggie, the Chinese actress. She speaks no French. Hello. How are you? Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. How are you? I'm Jessica. Maggie, look at that. It's very good. Hi. It's a new film that they made. No, no, no. It's 20 years ago. Oh. Twenty-five years ago. It's new. It's new. No. It's only work. You cannot judge that, you see? It was for French people, uh, cinéma militant. Political. Political. They does-They did politic, but now they don't do politic anymore. Yeah, but we're much better right now. I can tell you. I can tell you. It's great stuff. Don't repudiate it now. You know? They are sad because they think it's not good. I think it's-Oh, look. Look. Look at that. ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ CINEMA IS NOT MAGIC. IT'S A TECHNIQUE AND A SCIENCE. A TECHNIQUE BORN OF SCIENCE AND AT THE SERVICE OF A WILL. THE WILL OF THE WORKERS TO FREE THEMSELVES. ♪♪ Do you want some meat? Are you joking? I’m not joking. Do you want? You want wine, I’m sure. Yes, please. You know, Mireille did it, so it's-Okay. You have it. No. I can't. I just can't. Maggie. Maggie, she’s just telling me a wonderful story. Just-just- It was just about New York... and how they had this incredible snowstorm and I was there... while the snowstorm was going on. And it was amazing. It snowed so much-Ooh, ooh. Tell me what happened. Don't brood all night! There's nothing to tell. We talked. It was... pretty heavy. He was shooting daggers the whole time. Skiing? I tried turning on the radio, and I thought he'd slaughter me. He said I didn't understand him, that I was a mere technician. Yeah, that's what he said. You can imagine how well Markus took it. I was totally livid. I've been working with him for 15 years now. Can it be that lousy? He definitely has an eye. No, it's fine. I think so too. He got what he wanted. It's his movie. He's pissed because it's pretty. He'll muck it up in the editing room. It's not as good as Feuillade. Enough of Feuilladee! Feuillade's a drag. Unless I just don't get it. Even Les Vampires I saw two episodes on video. Thank God I could fast-forward! It's pretty flimsy stuff. It's like serialized novels. There's a poetry to it. Well, serialized novels were never my thing. Whatever. It's been done. Why do it again? You know what I mean? I told him it wasn't a good idea. It's a trap. He knew that. No, he's just starting to realize it. I swear. That's why he's so down. Obviously. He feels trapped. Let's change the subject and have a drink. They try to understand why René's angry. They say it's because he's scared. Really? He's scared? Maybe. What about you? Are you scared? No. I’m not scared. He takes out his problems on everyone else. He's always been a hypocrite. That's why I told him off, He didn't like it, but he needed to hear it. Directors thrive on hypocrisy. Yeah, but sometimes they go overboard. I went too far railing on Feuillade. Too late now. So what's the Chinese girl like? Not bad. I don't think she knows why she's here or what Rene expects of her. She shuts up and does her job. Does she talk about it? Not much. She keeps to herself. Is she bored? I don't know. During her costume fitting, she seemed to get into it. Her costume is... pretty tight. All latex. It's like she was poured into it. Yeah. We were in a sex shop for God knows how long. It's the usual, but no zippers at the breasts. There are even zippers here. Wow. But she's pretty, so she wears it well. She's pretty all right. Is she into girls? I don't know. I tried hitting on her. I didn't insist. I don't want to fuck up. And? But I like her a lot. Go for it. What's there to lose? She seems game. René will make my life hell. He's interested in her too? Ne. If he finds out, he'll get jealous. He'll torment us. You don't have to tell him. Take her home tonight and tomorrow on the set... mum's the word. I don't know if she'd want to. You said that- No, Mireille. I was talking about the costume. The costume? The costume. The tight fit, the latex. It seemed to turn her on. It seemed to or it did? It did. In fact, she asked if she could buy it after the shoot. She asked you that? Yes, yes. When? Here. Just before dinner. And you like her dressed as Catwoman? Yeah, she's great-looking. In fact, you want to touch her, play with her. She's like a plastic toy! Watch out. If she asked for the costume-Shh! Am I that funny? No, go on! Then you should go for it. You think so? Why else would she have come? They left her stranded at the lab. I was the only person left. She could have gone back to her hotel. She's all alone in Paris. She has no one. If she has no one, make the most of it. I think she likes me. And wanting the costume... is a way of telling you she wants you. Stop! You're wrong about the costume! It was cut to her size. That's all it means. Analyze the situation. She follows you. She's in there, surrounded by strangers. She can't speak a word. Uh- She's totally dependent on you. - She wants to be here. It's 1:00 a.m. - She's shooting tomorrow. If she wasn't “into it,” she'd be in bed already. Stop. Stop. What's more, she takes you aside to ask to buy her costume. Stop! It's obvious. It means “I'm into it.” No. “I'm into wearing my costume.“ Stop it! You're crazy! Zoé. She's completely crazy, you know. She just drink. Like this? Yes. Actually, I’m cold. Do you have a sweater? Oh, you're cold. Yes. Of course. Come in. Are you all right? Maurice, pour me a glass. I don't know which glass is mine. Thank you. You enjoy Paris? Yes. I like it. But I haven't seen much of it. You know, we're always working. And, uh, René is okay? Uh, I mean, he's nice with you? Oh, yeah, yeah. Uh, he's different. Yeah. And what about the part? Oh. That's fun. You know, it's like a cartoon character. It's fantasy. Yes, but a serious cartoon. Yeah. Well, especially Rene- he's dead serious. YOU KNOW. That's it. It's warm. And Zoé-Are you friend with Zoé? Oh. Yeah. Uh, she takes care of me, and I think she's a great person. Yes. She makes very good costumes. Mmm.Yeah. Do you like your costume? Yes. Zoé told me you want to buy it. Oh. You really want to buy it? Is it true? Because, if you don't buy it, I will buy it. Well, it's not your size. I can have it fixed. I like latex. Latex? Yes. Latex? Like plastic. Oh. Rubber. Yes. Rubber also. Yeah. It's very sexy. Mm-hmm? Mm-hmm. Do you like girls? Girls? Yes. Have you sex with girls? How about you? Have-Have you? Uh, me? No, no, Absolutely not. I'm very happy with Roland. Um, I'm completely straight. Why did you ask? Because, uh, Zoé wants to know. Well, why doesn't she ask? She's afraid. Afraid? Yes. She-She-She really want to know if you like her also. Zoé likes girls? Yes. Oh. Yes. Yes. She likes girls. She likes boys. She likes latex. Oh. She likes you. Oh! She does? Yes. Oh. And she really wants to know if, uh- Oh. if she- if you like her also. I'm sorry. I don't speak English. It's difficult for me. No. It's okay, but... I'm embarrassed, you know. Uh, well, I don't know. Do you like her? Um, I never thought about it. It's just- Your wife's a pain in the ass. What did she do? I told her Maggie turned me on. Now she's throwing her into my bed! Thanks just to screw things up. Changed your mind? I don't know. I drank too much. She's screwing things up! Look how she's smooth-talking her! You'll keep quiet next time. Live and learn. Thanks, but who has to work with her for a certain lapse of time? I do. Pop I Louder Jessica. Okay. ♪♪ He'll tell René. It'll all turn against me. You're acting like kids. ♪♪ Turn it down, Jessica. ♪♪ That's good. I like the music. ♪♪ Okay. Whoo! Thank you. Oh, it's okay. Good night. Good night. I'll call you tomorrow. I take a cab, and then I’ll pick you up at 7:30, okay? Mm-hmm. So don't-don't take cold, okay? Good-bye. Okay. Bye. - Good evening. - Good evening, madam. Uh, Room 612, please. 612. 612. Thank you. You have several messages. Thank you. Here. Good night. What are you doing here? Oh. Hi. Rene left me some messages in the hotel, Hi. And I called him back, and he said, “Come? Well, have you seen the time? I know. But-You should be sleeping. Come inside. Don't catch cold. Ah. I was just afraid something happened. Well, you know, René had a fight with his wife, very loud, and the neighbors-they got scared, so they called the firemen. Are you okay? Yeah. Can? we drive you to the hotel? No, thanks. I have my car. You sure you have a room? I reserved it. There's no problem. I'll call you tomorrow. When the firemen came, you know, Rene start to fight with them. So the police came, and it became a complete mess. And that lady just now- she's René's wife? Yes. You know what? They told her it's better for her to sleep in the hotel tonight. But why? Why? Because he can become violent. You know, he's very dangerous when he's like- the doctor's examining him. The tranquilizers seem to be working. On the surface, he's calm enough. But all the same- If he stays here, I’m going to need a discharge. What's a discharge? I need two people to vouch for him. Or else I'll take him in. He was rude. Wasn't he rude? Was he or wasn't he? Yes. I understand very well. But he's a very fragile person. Okay, forget it. Hi, René. Oh. Maggie. Lam pleased to see you. I must speak to you. You know, I'm not angry with you. It's okay. No. It's not okay. I am angry with myself. You know, it's just images. No soul. My fault. But I liked what I saw. You know, Feuillade... had the right eye. He had the right distance. If you change the distance, everything get... fucked up. But it's completely different. You know, we're doing something different. It's 1996. No. It's just images about images. It's worthless. But why did you want to do it in the first place? You know, Maggie. I have this idea of you in this part, in this costume. I thought it was very exciting. No. It's like a fantasy. That's desire, and I think it's okay, because that's what we make movies with. You think you are at the core of the thing, but in fact, you are just on the surface. But, urn, if you feel it, you're inside. You're not on the surface. - Do you feel it? - Mm-hmm. I feel nothing. Everything is fantasy, is deception. But it's just a part, and- I’m playing a part, and she's fun. I enjoy playing her. - It's like a game. - No, it's not a game. It's very important. Irma has no flesh, no blood. She’s just an idea. How can I be interested in an idea? How can I be interested in an idea? Voila. The doctor said to take two now and one tomorrow. Obviously. So you're not interested. I am interested in you. You. You are more important than the character. But in the end, there is nothing for you to act. Irma-it's an object. But she's very strong, and she's the center of the whole story. No, no. She just get fucked. That's all. That's not in the script. No, but it's pretty obvious. When the count of Caro is the head of the Vampires, she fucks Caro. When Moreno takes over, she fucks Moreno. When it is Satanas, Satanas gets her, and so on. She passes to the hand of one chief, to the hand of the other. That's all. You don't agree? Well, she has no morals, yes, but, um, is that a problem? Oh, no. Not a problem. And she wears a disguise, and she's a spy. She's courageous. That's right. You know, if she’s not there, there'd be no Vampires anymore. Okay. Let's go. Let's leave. Let's- René? Are you all right? René. René. Oh. René. Are you okay? I think we have to- to take it from- a completely different point of view. Completely different angle. Maggie, your taxi's here. I think we should let him sleep, you know. I think it's better. Is he gonna be all right like this? Yes, yes. I’ll stay with him. We should let him get some rest. Yes. Let him rest up. Come on. I'll just go that way. It's faster. Are you sure he'll be all right? Yes. Yes, yes. Okay.

Don't send me this ticket, for God's sake. I don't care if it’s a good hotel. I don't know a single soul, and I’ve seen every fucking movie in town, and that includes a Steven Seagal movie. Look. I know you have excellent excuses. Yeah. You have excellent reasons. But tell me, why am I always the one to call, always to ask? Fred! Really? What's this- Am I making this up? Am I ma-Am I inventing this relationship on my own? I can't believe-No way. I’m out of here. I'm not waiting one more day okay? For God's sake. Well-N- No. No. No, Fred. Okay. Fred. Fred. Honey It's fine. I-I didn't mean that. I really didn't mean that. I know. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Okay? Half an hour to get a skeleton key! Who knows what may have happened to her? Excuse me. Maggie. I can open it. She's always on time. I know you can open it. That's why we're here. Maggie? Maggie? Maggie? Maggie. Maggie. Turn on the light, please. Hey, Maggie. Ooh, ooh. Oh. Wake up. Maggie? Everything's okay, so I'll go. it'; 8:00. Oh. 8. '30. Oh. What time we were supposed to go? 7:30. You should be downstairs at 7:30. Sorry. It's very- But-Oh, God. I took some sleeping pills last night. Are you okay? I shouldn't have. I don't feel very well. But no, I can get up. Oh, God. Okay. Okay, cut. Very good. Are you okay? We'll do it once more. Okay. I felt you were forcing it. It should come across as effortless. Okay. I was too much of a pro. I'll try to be more instinctive. You have to be even more supple. Uh-huh. A little more-What's the word? Feline. More feline. What are we doing? We'll do it one last time. Okay? Okay Positions, please! You were supposed to be here at 8:30. She overslept. Why didn't you call her? I did call. She didn't answer. I let it ring and ring! I bet you did! What do you know? Anyway, she won't start shooting until 11:00. That's not your problem! Don't bother picking her up anymore. You're unreliable! Where's Rene? How should I know? Maybe this is him calling! Here she is. Hello. Are you ready? You can sit here, please? Sure. Yes. Thank you. Let me take a look. Come see. Yeah. Move in closer. She's gorgeous. You look beautiful. Yes. Thank you. I'll sit here. Okay. Let me open this. Oh, my God. I’m sorry. It's cold. Uh, excuse me. Can you take off this, please? Sure. Yes. Thank you. There. How's that? Good. Oh. I have my little, uh, fiche, you know. Ready? You can announce it. Maggie Cheung. Take 1. I mean, it's fun working with Jackie too. It's completely different. But, um, you feel protected. You feel- They're such big-budget movies, and you feel-they make you feel like you're a big star. And-But it's just tough on me, because I don't fight. I’m not a good fighter myself. So, it's a little bit difficult when I have to do-do the actions. And you worked also with john Woo? Uh, no. Uh, Bullet in the Head-I think it's a great, great film, you know. And, uh, you would like working with him? I think he's a great director, and he's very good. But, you know, he's so masculine. I think he's better with men. I think it's a great director! Very strong. It's genius, you know. Uh-huh. The gunfight scenes-It's like a ballet. Uh-huh. You know? Ballet? Like, uh, choreography. Choreography of extreme violence, no? I- I think it's the best one. It's very strong, no? It's powerful. Yes. Yeah. And, uh, what you think of, uh, French cinema? Uh, actually, we don't get to see a lot of the big- I mean, a lot of the French films don't come to Hong Kong, and maybe the bigger films... we will see with big stars like Alain Delon, Catherine Deneuve. Alain Delon-Uh, excuse me. Do you like Alain Delon? Oh, sure. He's very handsome. And, uh. Do you saw, uh, some movie of René Vidal? Yes. On tape. And, uh, do you like them? Uh, yes. I looked at the images, and it was very interesting. The images were very strong. Yeah, I liked it. Why are you laughing? Because you 're being polite. - Oh, no, no, no. I’m not. - It's a boring cinema. It's typical of French cinema, you know? “Nombrilistic, “ you know. Nombril. Nombril. Cinema about your Nombril. Only to please yourself, not for the public. It's only for the intellectuals, you know. For the elite. Public-real public- like a strong director, like, uh- I don't know, uh- Schwarzenegger, uh, uh, jean-Claude van Damme. You know Jean-Claude Van Damme? Yeah. It's, uh, like kung fu. Like, uh, john Woo. New film, you know? And, uh, René Vidal-it's not like this. It's, uh-It's crap. I don't agree with that at all. I mean, you're being very personal, and, I mean, I think there are different audiences who like different films, and there's nothing wrong with that. No. Rene Vidal-it's the past. It's the old cinema. Public doesn't want his film. No success. You know? It's, uh, uh, you know, state money. Friends giving money to friends for make a film nobody sees, you know? Only for the intellectuals. It's- Ah, I don't know. It's- But now it's-it's-it's over. It's finished. I hope. If there's just one type of film at the theaters, you'd be so sick of that too, and you'd be complaining. Yes, but you don't think the-the intellectual film killed the industry of the cinema? René is a pain in the ass! Has he really disappeared? Zoe says Maité can't find him. He's not at home. His wife is clueless. We're screwed! Wait. It's happened before. Yeah, sometimes he's late, but he never just vanishes. He better get back soon. Today's my last day. Tomorrow we take Polyeucte to Hénin-Liétard. Did Polyeucte do well? Yeah. It's a three-month tour. Incredibly well paid. Laure, follow me. I can fix your costume now. Don't iron now. Get me the costumes from the truck. Oh. - Where's René? - No one knows. Maybe Maité. But if she does, she won't tell me. What do we do? Just wait? We'll try shooting without him. If that doesn't work, if he doesn't pop up, we call it a clay. Shit, it's all wrinkled again. What a pain. Fuck! It's ripped. It's incredibly fragile. What did you do? I don't know. I didn't notice. Jesus Christ. What do I do now? - You really slept with Maggie? - Says who? Maité. She's telling everyone you took her home, not to the hotel, and scored her. Those were her words. I don't fucking believe it! What a bitch! That's total bullshit! I never even touched her! Don't tell her I told you. Fuck that bitch. Do you know José Murano? Hold on. Don't move. I did a movie with him. This material really sucks. - Is he a good director? - Yeah, not bad. This isn't working. Let me try something else. Get undressed. I'll stick gaffer tape inside. He left me three messages this morning. He must have a role for me. Call him back for sure. Okay. You know, the scene begins with a-a carton. A carton. A title. Yes. A title. The title says, in his own way, Moreno had fallen in love with Irma, and he didn't plan to give her back to the Great Vampire anymore. Um, so, you- you are standing here. Moreno is standing here. Uh, very close. Uh, Moreno puts his hand on your head, uh, like this- Mmm. And stare into your eyes. This is the name of the episode- Les Yeux Qui Fastment- “The Eyes That Fascinate.“ “The Eyes That Fascinate.“ Okay. She is completely into his hypnotic power. It's very important to show the hypnotic power of Moreno. It's a very strong hypnotist. So, you should sit. This seat. Irma is scared, but she's- Do that. I don't feel you're scared. Oh. Uh, I’ll do it again. I’m sorry. Okay. Um-Okay. Suddenly, he take a gun from his pocket. Take it! “With this weapon, kill the Great Vampire.“ And I can become the Great Vampire myself. What do you think? Um- Yeah, it's fine. But we have to be careful not to be too dramatic, 'cause René doesn't like it dramatic. Yes, I know. He want to be exactly as Feuillade did it. Yeah. Do you think he'll be back today? I don't know. But at least, if he comes back, we will be ready for the scene. We try it again? Yeah. The gun. Where did you find it? Okay. Let's go. When I-You stare at me. Okay. René-it's incredibly not professional. It's disappeared just like that. Yeah. It's shocking, no? For the technician, for the actor. It's typical of French cinema. Once, I work... with a Japanese crew. Very good organization. I was a waiter in a commercial at Restaurant Ledoyen. You know Restaurant Ledoyen? It's a big, big restaurant, very expensive, very good. The Japanese crew like military. I was impressed. Okay. We'll do it now? Yeah. Am I bothering you? - Actually, we're rehearsing. - Forget it. It's a wrap. It's end of the day. René won't show up. How do you know? I know. And what about my scene? Thanks. Thanks. Thanks. - I don't get it. - What is this? There's no call for tomorrow. Ah, come with me. I’ll take you back to your hotel myself. Okay. Good. You had a problem this morning? Oh, I went to bed really late last night. And Zoé- she was on time? Uh, I think so. Did she call you before she came? I think she did, but I didn't hear the ring. Ah. Then maybe she didn't call. No, but I was fast asleep. I didn't hear it. Fast asleep? Yeah. Oh. Zoé- she give you drugs. What drugs? Sure? Of course. Oh, because, you know, she pushes drugs on shootings. She makes extra money like that. I have this problem two times already with her. Smack. But I don't do smack. I don't do drugs. It's nothing like that. Once on a film we did together, there was this actress. She was taking drugs like that, uh, from time to times. When the film was finished, she was a complete junkie, all because of Zoe. She arrives late, she fell to sleep during the takes. Well, but she didn't do that to me, you know. She didn't give me anything. So don't worry. And Zoé's a nice girl. Maybe too nice, no? I know she likes girls, but it's no big deal, right? The big deal is she enjoy making troubles. You know, she's like all the junkies. They all do-Prosélytise. What's the English word? I think it's the same word. I don't use that word very much. But I don't think she's a junkie anymore. Oh. That's what she says, huh? That's what they all say, huh? I think it's true. Maybe. Now she drinks. Yeah. A lot. A lot. It's okay with me. I don't care. You do what you want with your health. It's not my problem. But I have to know, sol can handle it, you understand? It's my job. So if there’s anything you have to tell me, please do. You're not covering Zoé, are you? No. I always try to catch her, but she's very, very smart. Are you José Murano? Yes. I'm sorry. I'm late. No problem. What will you have? Uh- What are you having? A beer. Oh, yes? Me too. A beer. A beer for her and another for me. Yes. Good Voila. We've never really met. I'm happy to get to know you better. We've never really... spoken together. I've seen all your films. Excuse me for insisting so much. It's something of... an emergency. - Do you know why? - No. Oh, dam. No, not really. Then I'll tell you. René can't finish the film. Ah. Is that definite? The truth is, he's had a sort of... nervous breakdown. He's in a rest home. No need to panic. It's in the country. There's a big garden. He agreed to it. His doctor decided. What a disaster. We'll stop shooting. No. I was asked to take over. You? It's touchy. Can I really accept? René is a friend. You have a bit of foam- Don't let it get around. I don't understand something. Why a Chinese girl? Do you know? Uh- René said that- René. Whenever Rene opens his mouth, people stop thinking. You saw the state he's in. Who am I to say? He must have had a reason. I'm serious! Why a Chinese girl? He said he'd seen Maggie in a film... and it seemed self-evident. But Why? Come on. I saw Les Vampires 30 years ago at the Cinémathéque. Irma Vep is Paris. She's the Paris underworld. She's working-class Paris. She's Arletty! Irma Vep is street thugs and slums! Les Vampires isn't Fu Manchu, right? It's not Fu Manchu. I don't know. I don't know anymore. Can I have alight? I've seen Maggie in the rushes. She has a nice body. She's graceful. That's totally besides the point! I'm sure she's great. I saw her in that jack Chan movie. What was the title? What a piece of crap! She was fine. But she's not Irma Vep! No. I understand. I see what you mean. Anyway... I told them I'm not working now. Things are slow. My welfare's running out. I said... I need to think. A little. They said to think fast. I said okay. But only if I could change actresses. That Chinese girl- she's really not for me. You'd be much better. Me? Yes, you. Are you offering me the role? Uh, yeah. Oh. But- What about Maggie? Maggie, Maggie. She'll understand. She'll go back to Hong Kong. For me, this is really, really difficult. How is it difficult? Why? I wouldn't want people saying- Saying what? That I plotted to steal her role. It would be great to play Irma Vep, but... people talk and rumors spread fast.
