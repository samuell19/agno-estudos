Are you being purposely stupid The MAC is bullshit. It has no software, it has no memory, it has no expansion. No, I'm talking about the MAC Plus. It has a full megabyte of ram, expandable to four and a scuzzy interface. Who cares, what does that even mean? It means peripherals, scanners, modems, hard drives. I will actually be computing while you're playing Kings Quest on your PCjr. My PCjr with 16 color graphics and built-in joystick boards? You mean my PCjr with a three-voice tone generator? Hey! What the fuck are you looking at? Shit, it's Frankie. We're never getting in tonight. He's better than Rizzo, that's what I think. What grade are you in? Eighth. The back. Eighth grade in the back. Hey, get to the fucking back. No one's getting in yet. W-w-wait, you're talking about my PCjr with a wireless keyboard. You mean, that PCjr? Yeah, a wireless keyboard and a 14-inch monitor. I hope it comes with a sweet pair of binoculars. - What're you guys talking about? - Don't worry about it. I'm not worried. Stuff the kids are onto in like eight years. Who else is here? I don't know. Just us from our grade. - We better get in. - We're gonna get in. Not until the older kids get in, but after that, we're gonna get in. But not definitely, it's gonna be harder because of the kids. Because of all the stuff that happened. It's not gonna be harder. The stuff has nothing to do with us getting in. We're gonna get in. Paybacks! So, Lanky's coming. What about Lanky? - He's coming tonight. - Yeah, right. - Lanky can't... - He's definitely not coming. I know for a fact he's coming. You can't do what Lanky did and still go with things. Well, Brian Tate's brother works in Clearbrook, and he said Lanky's coming. And I don't care if you believe me or not. Why are you looking, Missy? I'm not looking Kira, god. - Looking for UFOs? - What? No. No way, man. There weren't any UFOs. Don't believe that shit. I don't believe it. She's definitely getting us, right, like, after? Yeah, she's-she's getting us. What if we don't get in, can she get us then? Look, we're getting in. - If only you get in... - No, we're both getting in. Stop worrying about situations that don't exist. - Why do you do that? - I don't know. I-I don't know. - It's-It's in there, right? - Yeah. - Don't tell anyone. - I won't. - Don't show anyone. - I know. - How'd you get here? - Why? Just asking. There's no why to it. My mom. She thinks Polo's is different than it is. And it's not far from the UFO thing. What, with the meeting? God, it's so stupid. Everyone here is so stupid. My dad's at the meeting, he says UFOs are real. They're not real. They were planes. Derek Scropelli's father filmed it. It's like a NASA thing now. It's bullshit. The entire thing. How could it be planes if the government's involved? If the government's involved then we're all fucked. Fucking Reagan. Yeah, uh, Reagan's really really bad. - Wait, you came alone? - I came with Jody Fagan. You don't even know Jody Fagan. Shut up, Kira. I know her now, okay. - Ninth grade Jody Fagan? - Jody Amazing? How many Jody Fagans are there? That's Jody Fagans? Everybody calls her Jody Amazing. I'm just watching it. I am Jody Amazing from the planet hot. What? Wait, when did you start hanging out with Jody Fagan? None of your business. Over the summer. Where's Jody Fagan now? She's talking to some Belmont kids in Lye. It's not like a big deal. It's really not fair. It's just one pop quiz. It's not the end of the world. Hey, Dean, who's at the door? Is it Frankie or Rizzo? It's Frankie tonight. - That's cool, right? - It's better than Rizzo. That's exactly what I said, Frankie's better than Rizzo. Three out of five should be more. It should be worth more. Three out of five is 60 percent. Shel, why do you have a backpack? It should be in 80 percent at least. Four out of five's 80. Yeah, but four out of five is almost perfect, and three out of five, that's next to almost perfect and it's only 60 percent. It's an F. God! The school year just started and I already have an F. Why do you have a giant backpack? I'm staying over Brad's so... So are you, like, moving there permanently? Are you running away from home, Shel? Are you a teen runaway? It's one pop quiz it's nothing. Yeah, but it counts now. It's eighth grade. It, like, counts. No, eighth grade does not count. Hey, do you guys know that Lanky's coming? Why are you saying Lanky's coming when two seconds ago, you didn't believe it? - Just saying it. - Lanky's in jail, idiot. It's not jail, Kira. Brad's right about eighth grade. It doesn't count. How do you know? 'Cause I have two brothers in college and... and all that time, nobody said anything about eighth grade counting. How did you get five out of five? If you pay attention in class, it's impossible to mess up. You don't even have to take notes, you just have to fucking listen. Hey Brad, when do you think Lanky's coming? How the fuck should I know? He never said he knew when Lanky was coming. Why don't you mind your own business, Kira? Why don't you go jack off, Dean? How's the other thing where you read backwards? Or like, a learning disability. I don't have a learning disability. I was all honors. - Not anymore, you're not. - But I was, and if you were ever all honors, you're still considered smart even if you're not all honors anymore. You should do BOUNCE, Shel. - I'm not doing BOUNCE. - What's BOUNCE? It's a program for dumb people or kids who are learning disabled. I'm not learning disabled. Or kids have to learn a trade, like being an auto mechanic that can't do anything real. Bored of United Cooperative Education. BOUNCE. Bored of United Cooperative Education. They have this class called "Life Skills". So like, instead of doing Cam or Trig or whatever, you learn how to cook or use a checkbook, and you get high school credits for it. For doing a checkbook? And for carpentry, plumbing... BOUNCE is actually starting to sound pretty good. - Plumbing Missy? - Yeah, plumbing and other stuff. Why do you know so much about plumbing? I don't Kira, okay. I'm just saying some of the things they do at BOUNCE. Oh, wow. Look at these clowns. Some kids in line said Brad and Steph are back here. - Hey, Lanky. - Lanky, what's going on? Nothing man, everything's excellent. - Hi, we were just... - ...waiting to get inside. - Hoping to get inside. - We're getting inside. Holy wow, Brad. Hey man, what's new? What's up, Lanky? Nothing man, everything's really excellent. Really, really excellent. Yeah, cool, cool. So... when are you coming back to school? I can go back whenever. It's not like a big deal or anything. I haven't seen you clowns. You guys heard about the UFOs, right? There aren't any UFOs. Right on, man. Just some crazy adults smoking too much dope, right? I mean, there might be UFOs. Brad, hey, you're playing... you're playing soccer this year, right? You're playing, right? Yeah, I'm playing, Lanky. Brad's playing select. It's like the whole county. It's like he's too good just for Brighton. God, you're such a kiss-ass, Dean. I'm just telling Lanky, 'cause... 'cause Brad's over there and he's-he's doing something. Yeah, I'm going to be playing too. Where I am, there's, like, a field and I'm definitely gonna be playing. When are you coming back? I can come back whenever. I already said that. Yeah, right. Holy wow, James. I didn't recognize you. - It's me, James. - Oh, wow, you... you really grew. You really grew. I grew. What do you even do there, Lanky? Asshole, don't ask him. It's just a question, Kira. Now, you guys don't have to be all weird or anything. I'm not gonna like freak out or anything. No, it's all really excellent. So what's it like? It's not even what everybody thinks, you know. You kinda just sit around and bullshit and stuff. And everyone smokes, and we're all really grateful. And sometimes, I talk to this doctor guy about my-my brother offing himself, and he's pretty all right. Uh, did you do school stuff, like tests? No. Man, no tests, no quizzes. No quizzes. Perfect for you, Shel. Uh, how'd you get here, Lanky? Oh, Billy Tate. He's a loon. He's got these smokes and they're dipped in this stuff. He's selling them for 10 bucks each. He's a fucking loon. Is that one? Um, no, no. I'm taking these pills that they only give out in Britain, England, and the doctor said I can't like, put stuff on top of it because it'll like fuck up my brain connections or some shit. What kind of pills? Uh, there's these things. They're from Britain, England. They're doing studies or something, here. So I get them as like a tester for free. Yeah, Billy Tate knows. Frankie has got like a bunch of these kids who he wants to get in to the... These kids are practically begging to get in. We're trying to get in. Oh, Billy Tate will get you in. They'll get all you clowns in, all right? I'll go back and get him and I'll bring him back here. He'll get all you clowns in, all right. I'll catch you clowns later. We don't need Billy Tate to get us in. - Is he really coming back? - He's a psycho. - Shut up, Kira. - He can't come back. You can't do what Lanky did and just come back. Lanky was a psycho before everything happened. He said he's coming back. Look, he's not coming back. Stop talking about whether or not he's coming back. It's pissing me off. Holy shit, what was that? Probably an excavator like a backhoe or something. Will they ever go home? They're behind so they have to work like 24 hours to finish. - That's what Mark said. - Who's Mark? Uh, he's my stepfather. He works there. Well, not in there, but at the IMT Headquarters down county. You know, two of the workers died in there. Just one died. No, it's two. One guy fell off the thing, the other guy got hit in the head and was fine but died later. It's like... no one knew anything was wrong with him, then he just died. But it's not death because of the head thing. Who gives a shit what it was, man? They're just dead. Hey, you know, my parents, they say it's jinxed 'cause of all the kids that died. It's jinxed because of the kids that died or kids died because it's jinxed? It's not jinxed. Seven kids died last year. That's jinxed. It's not seven. They say it's seven with the Brighton seven thing, but it's not. It's seven, okay. Chris Murco got hit by the speedboat. Dave Starks died on the motorcycle. - And then the foreign exchanger. - Yeah, the-the Belgian girl who fell off the bridge at Harmon Den. - Eveline. - Yeah. And then, uh, Scott Murphy died when he was standing on the car. - So that's four. - That's four. Uh, and then the other guy on the same day, from drugs. The one who works at the orchard. No one really knew him, but he still went to the high school. Yeah, uh, Glen Barber. Angel Dust. I thought he went to BOUNCE, Glen Barber. Don't make fun of it, Dean. God! Well, I'm just saying maybe the reason no one knew Glen Barber is 'cause he went to BOUNCE. I'm not making fun of it. How weird is it that it was the same day? I mean what are the chances that two kids die on the same day? In this town, they're pretty fucking good. And then, Lanky's brother. And Lanky's brother's girlfriend. But that's what I mean. Lanky's brother's girlfriend went to Belmont. - She doesn't count. - No, it still counts, asshole. - Just not in the Brighton count. - The death count. I know, but when you don't include Lanky's brother's girlfriend, it makes six, not seven. It's like Friday the fucking 13th here. Everyone dies. No, everyone doesn't die. There's 326 kids in high school, and seven of them died last year. - That's... - It's a lot of people. I mean, it really is jinxed here. It's just coincidence. Things aren't jinxed. You don't think things are jinxed but you think there are UFOs? I didn't say there were UFOs. What are you doing Kira? It's garbage. James, help me. There is something seriously wrong with you, Kira. - It's 2.28 percent. - What is? 2.28 percent of all the high school kids died last year and that's not including Lanky's brother's girlfriend. From the suicide pact. It wasn't a pact, Dean. It wasn't a suicide pact. It was a pact. Lanky's brother, Lanky's brother's girlfriend was a suicide pact. But it wasn't like an official pact. Shut up, Shel. It wasn't official, you mean it wasn't sanctioned by the International Suicide Committee? No, shut up. I mean, Lanky's brother's girlfriend did it in the bathroom at the drive-in, okay? And she only did it, because there's a scene in the movie where the guy did the same thing. No, everyone knows what happened. Lanky's brother did the same thing a few weeks later. So, that's not a pact. He's just doing the same thing. Ow! What the hell, man. I said shut the fuck up about it. Lanky's brother's dead, and Lanky's brother's girlfriend's dead so it doesn't matter what it was. So, shut the fuck up about it. Hey Dean, who's in line up front more? Uh, I don't know most of them. I think it's little Belmont kids. Tim Zito's there, Gico, Holly Handley. Hard rock Holly. The new girl's there. - Kate. - Aw, the new girl, Kate, is hot. New girl, Kate, is not hot. Maybe, not hot, but she's definitely pretty. She's definitely pretty, right Brad? She's all right, I guess. I don't know. She's definitely, at least, pretty. - She's maybe even hot. - No, she's new. Okay, there's a big difference between being pretty and being new. Who else is there? Uh, Frank Borts, Tanya and Tiffany. - Tanya and Tiffany are here? - Yeah. What are you listening to? - U2. - War? - Blood Red Sky. - War's better. How is it better? It's like the same songs. It just is. - U2 sucks. - What? - U2, they suck. - They do not. Go away. They suck and they stole their sound. - From who? - The Alarm. - The Alarm? - The Alarm. Trust me, no one stole their sound from The Alarm. Leave me alone. Yeah, well, in five years we'll see who's still around, okay? Shit, it's Rizzo. Now, we're definitely not getting in. 5-liter V8 180 horsepower. This thing kicks so much ass. - Hey, Shelby! - Oh, uh... Hey, Amy! I saw Brad in line and he said you were back here, so... Yeah, I'm just... - Lanky's here. - Uh, yeah, I know he's here. - He was just... - Yeah. Everyone's telling everyone else that Lanky's here. Yeah. We-we talked to him. You know, he's coming back to school. Can he really just come back? I mean, after... what he did? Maybe, he can come back, right? I'm here with Claudia. Uh, yeah, it-it's a really long line. Yeah, but I heard it's great inside. Yeah I... I think it'll be pretty cool. It's not gonna be cool. Have any of you poptarts ever been inside before? Why don't you leave if you think it's going to suck so much Kira? That's a really big backpack. Uh, yeah... I'm staying at Brad's tonight, so it's just stuff for staying over. Brad was with Tanya and Tiffany. I think they went up to the construction site. Uh, yeah, Tanya and Tiffany are here. - T and T. - What? T and T? Tanya and Tiffany. Some of the drama guys came up with the funniest names for Tanya and Tiffany. - Like Mike Grandy? - Yeah. He calls them T and T. And Doffer, right? Yeah, Doffer. He came up with "The Flying Velcro Twins". I know those guys. - We're doing Our Town. - What about our town? No, the play, we're doing Our Town in drama. Our Town? I mean, isn't that a little old fashioned you know, like, hokey and all that? I don't think so. I may have thought that because it seems like a play, you know, that a... bunch of little kids would do or something. But, it's really amazing once you get into it. It's... all of that how things always change and how people take life for granted. And a bunch of other stuff. You should come back to drama. It was so fun when we did Pippin, remember? I... You know, I can't this year, because... What are you guys talking about? I'm trying to get Shelby to do drama. - We're doing Our Town. - Great play. Great play. You've seen it? Nah, I just read it one night while I was doing nothing. Well, you should tell Shel to do it, so he can really see it. I was just telling him, it's really not too late to join up. Yeah, definitely, Shel man. It's a good play. I-I can't. I have soccer. - Do both. - I don't know. I have to go wait in line with Claudia, but I'll come back after for sure. Okay. I hope we get in tonight. Yeah, we'll all get in. Everyone gets in. Shelby... "You've gotta love life to have life. You've gotta have life to love life." It's my favorite line from Our Town. Really makes you think, you know. Why don't you do the play, man? You like that kind of stuff. Well, why don't you do it? I have selects. But you'd do it if you could? I'll do it if I wanted to. I don't know if I want to. You know, she likes you. Amy. I guess, maybe. You should go out with her. I don't know if I want to. You know, why don't you just fool around with her tonight? Maybe. I mean, she's cute, right? - Yeah, sure. - You don't think she's cute? I think she's cute. Would you go out with her? If I wanted to, I would. Would you fool around with her? Yeah, if I wanted to, I would. - Head's up, head's up! - Hey! Fucking watch it, dude. How do you know if she'd fool around with you? Look, I don't... okay? If I thought about it and I decided I wanted to fool around with her, then I would. Obviously, she'd have to wanna fool around with me too, but it's not like she asked me. She'd fool around with you. Everyone fools around with you. Why don't you just fool around with her tonight, then after, see and really fool around with her? Yeah, she definitely means that, I think. Yeah, I should just do it, right? What's funny? It's just you. I mean, fooling around shouldn't feel like it should. All right. I'm really gonna do that, okay? I'm really gonna do that. Move it back, please. Back away. Come on, I'm not kidding. Back away from the fucking door. Or nobody's getting in. I thought you said Frankie was cool and that Rizzo was... I said Frankie's the cooler one not the cool one. I knew we weren't getting in. You guys should just shut up for five minutes. I don't even have to wait out here. I can get inside whenever I want. Yeah, right. I can. There's another way in. - What other way? - There's no other way. - Don't listen to her. - Why're you waiting here with us if you can get in whenever you want? Because I don't feel like going in yet, Messy. Seriously, what other way in? I'm not telling. You're not telling because there isn't one. Over there on the roof, there's a door. It goes into an office, like it sort of opens up and you walk down. Well, feel free to go check. Maybe I will. And James too, right, James? - On the roof? - On the roof. What time is your sister getting us tonight, like if we get in? You're staying at my house, so it doesn't matter. And she's taking me home in the morning, right? Yeah, she can take you home in the morning. I mean I... I know she can take me home in the morning, but does she know she has to take me home? Why are you freaking out, Shel? Look, she can take you home, okay? Yeah, uh... it's fine, um... Yeah, it's just, uh, Mark. He's coming home tonight and I have a bunch of stuff that I have to do around the house this weekend and then, if I'm not home by like nine or ten, tomorrow's really gonna suck. You're an idiot. Fuck off, Dean. Why am I an idiot? 'Cause you already know tomorrow's gonna suck and you still wanna be on time for it. You're a sadist, Shel. He's not a sadist, he's a masochist. - I meant masochist. - A sadist gives all the torture, - a masochist takes it. - I know, I know. - I just mixed it up. - It's not torture, okay? It's just stuff around the house, okay? I'm sorry, Pete, that we're not all totally rich like you and have to do the yard work ourselves. What yard work? Do you live in a farm now, like Little House on the Prairie? Are you Half Pint? You're so fucking Half Pint, Shel. It's just like sweeping the garage and weeding the steps, and the solar panels, they have to be clean. There's a whole list. Who the fuck has solar panels? Mark. Mark has solar panels. What the fuck are solar panels? The only time I've ever seen solar panels was on 60 Minutes. Who the fuck watches60 Minutes? They save electricity, solar panels. I watch 60 Minutes. Is that lame? How much do they save, Shel? The solar panels. I don't know. I don't do the bills when they come. I don't sit there and write the checks. If, uh, Shel went to BOUNCE, he'd know how to write the checks. Awesome. That was fucking awesome, James. What happens if you're late tomorrow, Shel, for the chores? I'll be grounded and I'll have to do a bunch of shitty stuff and not the stuff I wanna do. What's funny? You're already grounded. You're already sweeping garages and cleaning solar panels. - That's grounded. - I'm not grounded. Yeah, I'm not grounded. Hey, Shel, you're, um... you're taking Spanish this year, right? Uh, I mean, everyone says it's easier to do French, so... Yeah, I-I think French is harder at first, but... when you kinda get used to it... It's like the way you speak French is harder than the actual French, you know. Yeah, maybe that's true. Are those Capezios? No, uh, they're just these things. They're really, really white. Uh, yeah, they're pretty new, so... Uh... Amy, maybe, uh, do you wanna go to the... - construction site, and... - Yeah, sure. I mean, we're just waiting in line. Yeah, uh, we're just waiting in line. - Okay. - Yeah. What happened, Kira, in the newspaper? - 21 killed. - 21 what? - 21 people, Messy. - Fuck you, freak Kira.. Okay, I said stop calling me that. Who do you think I meant, 21 walruses? How should I know? Kira, you're so weird, it could mean anything. Oh, I'm weird? I'm not the one who went to Aaron Palmer's slumber party... - Shut up, Kira. - ...and made such a mess. What mess? What is she talking about? Nothing, Dean! Okay? Just mind your own business. 21 people killed at a McDonalds in California. From what, the food? No, from a fucking psycho with guns. 21 people. A four year old kid. I mean, what the fuck, right? What the fuck? What the fuck? Um, are your parents going to that UFO meeting tonight? Uh, I think so. Well, I mean, not my dad 'cause he doesn't live here, but my mom is. And Mark. My mother's not going. She didn't think the UFOs were real. They definitely were not UFOs. Why not? I mean... something has to be out there, right? I mean... somewhere. We'd probably know about it by now, right? I guess. But, I-I feel it's... more like something just... you feel. You know, like there's something more. I don't think I feel anything. Do you still go to his house every other weekends, you know, your dad's? Uh, mostly, yeah. Except my dad sort of... can't come to the house anymore to pick me and my sister up. Why not? It's just this... thing... that happened with my dad and Mark, you know, my stepfather. It's just this thing that happened. Yeah, but now he can't come pick you up? I mean, what happened? Uh, it's not a big deal, but... my dad, he came to pick us up and when he pulled in to the driveway he sort of went close to Mark's car with his van, by accident. - Well, did he hit it? - Well, not at first, but... if he backed out, his back bumper would scrape Mark's bumper or like the part next to the bumper, but my sister said to go get Mark so he can move his car even though he'd be pissed about it. Well, did you get him anyway? No, my dad just backed out and hit Mark's car pretty bad. Not really bad, but pretty bad. - Oh, no. - Yeah. And so, Mark came out, 'cause he was watching from inside, he was yelling. And my dad got out of the van. They got all face to face. Oh, god... Shel, what happened? It's not a big deal or anything, but I was watching and Mark, he was saying stuff like my dad's a loser, you know, stuff like that, and then... What? Mark hit my dad. Oh, my god, Shelby. Mark hit my dad and my sister yelled. Well, what did your dad do? I don't know. He did... nothing. He did this, like, smile, like it didn't matter, like it didn't hurt him. Or like, like, he was above it, you know. Well, I guess that's good. Yeah, it's cool he didn't do anything back, you know. Yeah, you know, that-that was pretty cool. Yeah. Yeah, it was definitely cool. So, anyway, my dad can't come to the house anymore so we just meet him over in the Sears parking lot. Why did he shoot everyone? The McDonald's guy? Because he's a fucking psycho. Yeah, but why? There's gotta be a better reason than just he's a psycho. Here, he left a note. "Fear of international bankers that break down society. Fear of soviet aggression." Well, he's worried about the Russians. The arm's talk is just a trap. They're gonna bomb us. You can't trust Russians. Why is that funny, James? We-we can't hug our children with nuclear arms. War is not healthy for children or other living things. What if they gave a war and nobody cared? What is that? What are you saying? James' mother has all these magnets that say all the... like, "No amnesty for Nixon." The kind of shit nobody cares about anymore. She was a hippie, and now, she's just normal. God, you guys are so weird. Read something else, Kira. Like, what else happened? A large pile of bullshit. - Holly Handley's here. - Hardrock Holly. It's so funny, she always wears those shirts. Yeah, she wore a "Hardrock London" yesterday. Right? That's something in music. And Lanky, and I just... I can't believe he's coming back after, you know, what happened. His brother. Well, yeah, and the other stuff. It's just weird. He's here with everyone. Brad knew Lanky's brother. Like, knew him a lot. He did? Brad's sister is friends with Lanky's brother, - but Brad knew him too. - Hm. Uh, what happened with your dad? He died, Shelby. I'm just messing with you. I know you know, and that everyone knows. You should've seen your face just now. It's okay, you don't have to, you know, not talk about it or pretend it didn't happen. Did he have cancer? It wasn't cancer. It was a lot of things. And he drank too. But we didn't really know about that until after. I mean, I sort of knew, I just didn't know it meant anything. And I was pretty much a kid for all that time so... - Yeah. - ...what's a kid gonna do? - You were just a kid then. - Yeah. You know, it was just, um, things Laura and I was used to. And like, my father, he... never really knew how he was gonna be. It's like he... wasn't even my father anymore. He was just this thing. I don't really know how to explain it. Yeah. So when he died, it sort of felt like it was a relief. You know, like it already happened. It was better without him. I know that sounds weird, but I mean, it was true. I've been doing more things in school. I'm even doing drama again and it's so much fun. It's really not too late to join up. I know, but I have soccer. Oh, you play with Brad, right? Uh, well no. Brad is... playing select with some of the kids he's only been going to prep with. What does that mean? Select. It means Brad's really good at soccer. Wow, that's weird, 'cause he's such a great artist too, you know. I'm aware. You know, I-I might be going to a different school next year, too. But it's definitely not like a prep school or anything like that. You're moving, like... you're not going to the high school next year? No, I mean, it's not for sure but I think... last year really freaked my mom out with all the... deaths and suicides and everything. Do you think Brighton's jinxed? I mean, Pete said we have a 2.28 percent chances of dying when we get to the high school next year. No, I don't think Brighton's jinxed. I just think that's what people wanna believe. But why would they wanna believe that? I don't know. Maybe, so they don't have to believe anything else. Vanessa Williams nude. Hey! Yeah! She can't be Miss America anymore because she was in Penthouse. I saw it in school, the Penthouse. Pat Skilly brought it in. "Pageant officials deemed that Miss Williams displayed behavior unbecoming to the crown." So she was naked BFD. What else, Kira? Nothing. A thing about that preschool where the teacher used to do it with the little kids. Gross. That is so gross. There's some bullshit about that phony fucker Springsteen. Bruce Springsteen isn't a phony, Kira. Why'd you say that? - Because Messy... - Stop calling me that. Because he let Reagan use his song and Reagan sucks. So that means, he's just like Reagan except worse, because he pretends he's not like Reagan - which means he's a phony. - You're so stupid. Okay, Springsteen told Reagan he can't use his song, because he doesn't mean what he's using it to mean. He was just on yesterday. She's right. Pete, tell your freak girlfriend - that Springsteen's cool. - Shut up, Dean. You shut up. Do another, Kira. Don't. Shut up. No one cares about your current events. No, you poptarts need to know stuff. Everything is crazy, and everyone is crazy, and no one's paying attention. Christ, Kira, can you just relax? You're a shithead, Dean. You think you're smart, but you're not even smart. You just read stuff, hear stuff, repeat it all. You're a repeater. That's so stupid, Kira. Why are you so weird? Why do you dress like that and act so weird? - She's not weird. - She is. And so are you, James, because you're drawing faces and taping them to a wall. That's not weird? It's the Brighton seven. Brighton seven. Are you kidding me? God, you guys are so freaky. Why are you like that, Kira? She thinks she's too good for everyone. - Maybe I am. - No. She thinks she's too bad for everyone. That's the real problem. It's like you guys couldn't be normal so you become this and you pretend like you wanna be this way all along. No one thinks like this because you wanna be. - Dean, cut it out. - No. She pretends she's not friends with anyone anymore out of choice. It's not out of choice, Kira. I'm not friends with you all anymore 'cause you're all poptarts. All of you. You're all fucking poptarts! You ever just shut the fuck up? Where's the beef? That's the big goddamn question, James. Where is the beef? What's in the backpack? Um, I'm staying at Brad's tonight so it's just stuff for staying over. Yeah, but there's so much. What's in it? - No way. - Oh, yeah? - Nice try. - Come on. Stop bro. Stop being so... weird about it. I've seen guys' underwear before, Shelby. So, BFD. - Big fucking deal. - Mm. - It's gonna be cold later, so... - Oh, yeah. Be prepared. Cub scouts. Boy scouts, but... Got it. All right, let's see. You've got clothes, a flashlight, toothbrush, mag... Whoa... - Shel. - Okay, those aren't mine. - Magazines. - My stepfather has them, and Brad. He wanted me to bring them. I'm pretty sure everybody's stepfather has these type of magazines. Do you like these women? I mean, I like them as friends. No, but I mean like... do you like them like the way they look? I don't know. I don't really... I mean, I guess they're pretty okay. All right. What else do you have? You've got some snacks. Um, music and tapes which is ZZ Top and The Fixx. Hm. - Wait, no. - Shelby... - This is a gun. - No, it's not. I know what a gun looks like. It's not like a gun gun. Why do you have a gun? Wait, okay. I don't. It's Mark's. He has this den with stuff in it, and he locks it, but you know, just like one of those locks - you know, you just like... - Yeah, but I mean, why do you have it? It's a gun. Wait, just 'cause Brad has one too, we were just gonna... mess around, okay? His mom's in the Bahamas, we could just do whatever. Looks really scary. It's just a BB gun, okay, and pellets like you-you just pump it once and shoot it. It just stings a little. Some guys in my neighborhood do it. they have one-pump wars and I don't really do that, but they do, and it's fine. Okay, well, what does two pumps do? Yeah, these are the pellets. Two pumps could break the skin probably. Okay. Just point her there and shoot the thing. That was... that was awesome. What does three pumps do? Uh, well, three pumps will break the skin especially with the pellets. Here. Okay. Do-do four. Do four. Come on, do four. That was awesome. I guess I'm pretty good at it. I should probably go see if Claudia's, you know, talking - to anyone. - Yeah, yeah, sure. I... I should have to clean up all this so I probably - should go back too, so... - Yeah, no, I'll-I'll come back and... 'cause it's fun with you guys. Yeah, okay. Sure. - Bye. - See you, Amy. I'm trying. I'm trying. It's too high. No, it's not. You're right there. Just grab the fucking ladder. Too high. Let me down. What the fuck is wrong with them? - Shut up. Shut up. - Sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. If they're gonna let us in they should just let us in. They will. They pretty much have to. - What? - What happened? - How was it? - It was okay. I don't know. Did you fool around? I don't know. I mean, not really. What do you mean? You either fooled around or you didn't. I don't know, okay? I don't know. Why didn't you fool around? We just didn't. Just like, we didn't. But she went to the construction site to fool around with you, - what the fuck happened? - Nothing happened, okay? Nothing happened. Dean, do your parents know you're here tonight trying to get in to Polo's? Do any of our parents know we're here? They're all at the UFO meeting. It's so stupid. UFOs. There aren't any UFOs. I'm the one who doesn't think there are UFOs. I don't think there are either. How do you know? The news said, 9,000 adults saw the same thing. The same lights, the same shape. Derek Scropelli's father filmed it. You said that already. Who cares who filmed it? Derek Scropelli's father is like the vice president - of the computer firm. - And that makes him an expert on what's a UFO and what's not a UFO? It was like plane formations. How do you know? My uncle's friends. They did the whole thing. Bullshit. Uncle's friends... They flew planes with grid lights all over the place just to freak everyone out. It was a hoax, the entire thing. They also filmed the hoax. - That's what's weird. - And you could hear the engines of the plane and when it flew under the moon you could still see the moon. - So? - So it wasn't solid. The film that Derek Scropelli's dad has is solid and there were not any engine sounds. It's bullshit. - It's bullshit. - 9,000 adults saw it. He's right, Dean. 9,000 adults can't all be crazy. Where does your mother think you are, Shel, tonight? She just thinks I'm at Brad's so I can't be in trouble for being here. Why not? 'Cause I'm just doing what Brad's doing. I mean it doesn't count like it would if this was a normal day. What about you, James? What did you tell your parents? He didn't tell them anything. They don't really ask. He lives in the apartment above the garage all by himself. You live in an apartment, James? God, that's so excellent. You're so lucky. Missy, where are you supposed to be right now? I'm with Jody Fagan... Jody Amazing. ...at a place called Polo's that's like a birthday place. My parents think I'm eating Tootsie Rolls and ice cream cake right now. Where is Jody Fagan? She living here? - I told you she is up in... - You're such an idiot, Missy. Jody Fagan isn't hanging out with you. She is. She just knows a lot of Belmont kids... Jody Fagan used you for a fucking ride. Holy shit, when did you get this stupid? - Kira, lay off. - Go to hell, Kira. We used to make fun of Jody Fagan, remember? The "slippery slut" we called her because of the Halloween thing. Hey wait, Jody Fagan's a "slippery slut"? I mean, do you actually think Jody Fagan would ever wanna be friends with someone so... messy? Why do you keep saying messy? Yeah, what does that mean? Yeah, why do you keep calling her... Because I peed in my sleeping bag. Okay, everyone? Are you satisfied, Kira? Is it like the biggest deal in the world? I was 12 and I peed in my sleeping bag at Aaron Palmer's slumber party. Is everyone happy now? Why did you pee in your sleeping bag? I don't know. Why does anyone do anything? I just did. That's why Kira calls me Messy. Get it? 'Cause my name's Missy. You're such a loser, Kira. But you know what? I'm not even mad, and I don't even care. I just feel sorry for you. It really is getting cold. Kira came with us to the lake last summer. I didn't want her to come, but... My mom said it seemed like Kira never did anything fun. I wasn't really friends with her anymore so I hated bringing her. But, that weekend I realized I was never friends with her. That she was just the same age and around the neighborhood so we do things together, like automatically. But at the lakehouse, all the summer kids could tell you were a loser. And I sort of saw you for the first time from like someone else's eyes. And it was so obvious, god. I couldn't wait for that weekend to end, couldn't wait for you to go home. I couldn't wait. Holy shit, no way, look. Look, another UFO. I mean, what are the chances. We should alert the authorities for being invaded by aliens. We've come to get in to Polo's and we will not wait in line. Why do you keep doing robot voice for aliens? They're aliens. Ever talked to an alien before? How do you know they talk like robots? They're from the future. Space isn't the future, idiot. And robots already exist. It really is getting cold. Yeah, sometimes it feels like there's no fall anymore. It just goes from summer to winter here, you know. It's how it goes every year. I mean like, it skips the fall weather. Like, I fully understand winter comes after summer... So fucking annoying. Arguing about every fucking thing. You're pissing me off. It's cold now. It'll be really cold sooner. Then there'll be of an opportunity for snow days. It's nothing to do with snow, how cold it is. It has to be cold to snow. I-I meant, being cold now has nothing to do with whether or not it's gonna snow more in the winter. But if it's cold now, then it's gonna be really cold sooner... Jesus Christ, shut the fuck up. You guys are fucking annoying and I'm sick of it. Keep fooling around, Dean? Huh? If you guys are gonna fight all the time, then do it. You fucking hate each other. Yeah, right. I'm... ...not, not gonna fight, not... They shouldn't hit each other, Brad. Come on, Dean. I don't like to listen to your fucking bullshit. - Quit it, Brad. - Look, shut up, Missy. I'm fucking tired of these two. Come on, Pete, fight Dean. Hey, cut it out. I don't wanna... I don't wanna do this. Goddammit! Fucking hit each other. - I'm not... - Stop it. - Man, calm down. - Hey, fuck you too, Shel. I'm tired of you, too. Not just fucking push each other. There you go. - Haven't you had enough? - Guys, stop it, please. - Brad, stop it! - Guys, stop! - Dean, stop. Dean, stop. - You're crazy, Brad! Get off me! Come on, guys. Hurry up. What, you all hear that? My god, we're getting in. - We're finally getting in. - Getting in. You fuckers. We're getting in. Yeah, they're gonna start letting in the younger kids now. Yeah, Billy Tate. He said that... all you faggots back here are gonna get in. - Fuck you, Lanky. - Kira, shut up. - We're getting in. - I'm just kidding around. I'm just kidding around. See, he's just kidding, Kira. Shut up. Yeah, Billy Tate. He's a loon, man. He gave me these smokes and said they were regular, but they're not, they're dipped. Dipped and dusted, that's what Billy said. Lanky, are you all right? Yeah, I'm doing excellent. I told you that before. You-you gotta go back tonight? I just gotta show up to show them that I didn't jump in front of a train, or smash someone's head in with a bat. Ha. No, I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding. No one else is coming... Does anybody wanna smoke this fatty? Me and Billy rolled with this fatty. Shel, man, you want this. Right, so... Uh, no. I don't think so. Come on, man. Do you want to? Hey, shut up Lanky. Ah, how about you, Brad? You wanna... No, Lanky. Come on, man. You used to get high with my brother, right? That's uh, pretty cool, Lanky, you know, to go back. I don't have to do anything. I said that before. I can do whatever the fuck I want. Okay, okay. It's the best thing that ever happened to me. My stupid brother stringing himself up in the fucking bathroom. Seriously, man, you've got this pain in the ass brother, always beating the shit out of you and stealing your fucking dough, and think about it. Your brother hangs himself with your fucking belt. And you have to find him because your parents are out doing whatever the fuck it is they do. Looking for spaceships or some shit. It's excellent from that day on. It's like you go in there and he's just there. You know, like hanging in the shower. And you try to get him down, but the fucker's so heavy. You can't move him. His feet are still touching the ground. Like that's not what hanging is. How can the fucker be dead if his feet are still touching the ground? Seriously, man. I mean, his girlfriend strings herself up and everyone said my brother could too. And my parents, they had to watch him. But they didn't. So now I do whatever the fuck I want, when I want, get whatever I want. My dad bought me a truck. I can't even drive that shit for two fucking more years. No, Lanky, your brother was cool. Dean, man, you like trucks and shit, right? This truck is fucking mint. What kind of truck is it? SR5 '84 fucking loaded, man, loaded. Oh, fuck it. What do you do with it if you can't drive it? I go in there and I just fire it up. Listen to some tunes, you know, some fucking Maiden, some fucking Priest. It's got five speakers. Sounds like you're in Hartford fucking Civic Center, man. I sit in there and I think about how I'm gonna be driving - that badass all over town... - You hear me, Lanky? - You hear what I said? - You don't even... No, man. You don't even know. Your brother was cool. He'd come over and he'd hang out and he was cool. Come on, who wants to get high? Any of you faggots? Shel, man, Jew want to, right Shel? Shut up, Lanky! Jew, why you're... why aren't you getting mad? Fuck off, Lanky. You're being a psycho. What about you, James? You're like a freak now, right? Why don't you look at my face? Look at my face. Look at my face! Fucking stop, asshole! I'm just kidding around. What? None of you faggots wanna get high? I'm letting you get high for free and nobody wants to? I will. Yeah, I want to, Lanky. Ah, see... at least someone's not a fucking faggot. Let's go to the construction site. I'll take you there. Okay, come on, let's go. You fucking fags, man. He's such a psycho, holy fuck. - Kira, Lanky's brother. - Lanky was an asshole before that happened. The only reason anyone gives a shit about Lanky is because his brother killed himself. We were friends with Lanky. We were all friends with Lanky. I mean, it's so stupid. I'm not even Jewish, I'm only half. W-was your mother or your father Jewish? What? My mom is. Well then, you're Jewish automatically. What do you mean? That makes no sense. You can't be a religion just because of someone else. It's a fact. If your mom is Jewish then you're Jewish. It's religion, it's not a thing. What does that mean? It means, a religion is a belief and a belief is an action. You have to practice it to be it. You can't just biologically inherit something that you practice. I'm not Jewish, okay? - My dad's Catholic. - Okay, my mother plays tennis. Doesn't make me a tennis player, does it? So stupid. No, it's not. She plays tennis. She doesn't believe in tennis. My mother believes in Peach Schnapps. My mother believes in Neil Diamond. My mother believes in not being with my father. My mother believes in Zimmermann. My father believes in other kids' mothers. And the point is, it's all the same thing. If you're parents are black then you're black, that's genetics. You don't have to practice being black. Shel, do you say the prayers and do the Hanukkah stuff? Um, sort of. But I also celebrate Christmas so it cancels out. But if you go to a temple one day, you go to church the next, they cancel each other out. No, if you sorta celebrate Hanukkah, you're Jewish. How can he be more Jewish than Catholic if he still does the Christmas stuff? Because being Jewish is less common so if you're a little Jewish, it counts more. All right, get in a straight line everyone. Don't fuck around, I'm not kidding here. They're letting everyone in. To come in, kid, you gotta stay in line. Fucking hurry, okay? Let's go inside, man. Everyone's going inside. I don't care. - What do you mean? - I don't care. I don't want to. Okay, don't worry about that, about Amy. Look, she's okay. I don't want to. I don't want to. Wait, you don't wanna go in to Polo's? What are you talking about? I don't wanna do those Mark chores tomorrow. I don't wanna do it every other weekend. I miss soccer games every time I go. I don't wanna be like that. Shel, it's okay. Just go inside. I got three out of five on that quiz. I don't wanna do that. I mean, I was all honors. - Now, I got three out of five. - Shel! You're going in. - Shel! - You told me about this. - Lanky, stop it. Get off him. - What are you doing? Fuck off. No, no, stop! Lanky! - Fuck, no! - You fucking asshole! - Fuck you, Lanky! - Lanky, stop! - Give it back! - No! - No. - Don't. Don't. - Do you want me to stop? - Come on, Lanky, cut it out. You want me to stop? Oh, sure. Here, I'll stop right now. No! You fucking asshole! Brad, stop! It's Lanky, Brad. It's Lanky. Oh, wow. Fuck. Wait. Kira, you're going inside? After all that? I thought you said it was stupid and lame? Poptarts. That we were all poptarts waiting to get inside. I don't know. I mean, what else are we going to do? What are we gonna do, Missy? I mean, there's really nothing else to do. Shel. - Shel! - What happened? - Where did you go with Lanky? - Look, it's okay. I just talked to him. I just... - tried to... - Where did you go with him? I just tried to make him calm, that's all. What are you talking about? We talked about his brother's funeral. They played a song called, "Wildland" or "Wild World" it was, and, his girlfriend wrote a note that she wanted the song to be played over and over. And, his brother, he wanted the same thing. "Wild World". That was definitely a "Wild World". Amy, you shouldn't have gone. And then we smoked some of his pot. And, he saw the thing where you put the gun and he-he asked and I told him 'cause we were just talking. And it was sort of okay until then, and I... I don't know. I shouldn't have told him about the gun. The gun. - Stupid gun. - I'm really okay. Shelby, I... I don't know. I probably shouldn't have gone, but I did. Sometimes, we just do things, and... I'm glad you did that. I wanted to. I really wanted to. Me too... i-it felt important. Do you wanna go inside? Everyone went inside. I want to, okay? I really do. Me too. I wanna do everything. Okay, I wanna do drama and be in Our Town, and I wanna do soc... I wanna do everything. I don't wanna get three out of five anymore. I'm not gonna do that. I don't care what time I get home tomorrow morning. I don't care what Mark says. I'm really gonna do everything. You should do it. Do you wanna go inside? Everyone else did. No... well, I mean, yeah, but, I wanna find Brad. I mean, I'm sure he's okay. He's Brad, you know. I'll see you inside. Oh, shit. Brad? Go away. What are you doing? Go fucking away. There are pellets in there. If you want me to beat the shit out of you, I'll beat the shit out of you. I swear to God. Leave. I said fucking leave. I'm not kidding. Leave. Brad. Man, I saw it. I liked Lanky's brother. I liked him. He used to come over and hang out with my sister. He was so cool. She knew his girlfriend too. He used to come into my room and talk to me about stuff. Talk to me about high schoolers, and some of the crazy stuff. He talked to me about girls, the stuff he did with them. Boy, he was cool. So one time, he... he came to my room and I was... I was reading something. It's a book. I forget... but... He had read it too, uh... a long time ago. Watership Down. He just started telling me all these stuff about this book. Stuff you would only know if somebody told you, because it-it... it wasn't in the book, it was... it was like deeper than the book. He was full of that kind of stuff. Deeper stuff. Everything was cool. He gave me this record, Frank Zappa, and a bunch of funny songs on there about eating yellow snow. We'd memorize the lyrics and we'd laugh. He was cool. So cool. Lanky's brother was cool. I saw it, Brad. Okay, I saw it, man. I saw it. - What? - The thing. It's real. It's really real. W-what? What the fuck are you talking about? Y-you can see it, the UFO. I swear to God, I just saw it. There's no UFO, man. You sound like Pete and those assholes. Okay, it's real. And it's not planes because it was solid under the moon and it didn't make any noise. Bullshit. There's nothing out there, man. Just come on, you'll see. You mean the fucking UFO? Dude, there's no UFO. There is, come on! It's awesome. It's totally awesome.
