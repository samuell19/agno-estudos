Oh, is that mean that I had to be too? Come on, Megan. I'd like to get some sleep tomorrow is my big day. I know, you're right. Please forgive me.

Oh, right. This is... - Zig. - Ziggy, actually. But my friends call me Zig. Megan's told me all about you. We just met last night. Over the phone. How did you refer to him? The man of your dreams. I can see why. Ziggy is the new bartender. This is my soon-to-be ex-roommate, Cara. - Hi. - Nice meeting you. I've gotta get going. I can't be late on my first day. - Cara's just been promoted. - Sweet! What do you do? She's an editor. Associate editor. At Owens and Zeller. Explains the books. I was worried they were yours. No place like home. I guess we're not in Kansas anymore. Did they lose the keys to this room? They didn't want anything disturbed in case Gilbert was working on something important when he died. So on top of everything else it's our job to figure that out? Think of it as a mission. Unlocking 'The Secrets of Harry Gilbert.' - The wizard. - Do you know how many Best-sellers he edited in here? - No. - Let's just hope he left his wizardry here for me. Fred. What's the status on 'Northern lights?' I spoke to Jonathan - over the weekend. - Does he understand what a million copy first printing is? - Of course, it's just... - We paid him $600,000 For this book. It is scheduled to be our big Christmas release. Do I have to remind you of that? - No, I... - Good. Then inform Mr. Grey that he better stop fucking around and get his manuscript in on time. Cara, are you all moved in? It's underway. Let me know if you find anything interesting. Meanwhile 'Diet for a Sensuous You'? Ready for copy editing. We're going to push the release date to this November. I think it'll make a perfect stocking stuffer. How did it go? She wants 'Diet for a Sensuous You' ready for Christmas. - This Christmas? - Uh-huh. Oh, and then there's this. 'Looking for a Husband in All the Wrong Places.' After the meeting she pulled me aside, told me: "This is right up my alley." Was that a compliment? I'm not sure. Will you look at this? I don't believe there is 'sufficient market for legal thrillers.' This guy's been at the top of the best-seller list for the past decade. Wonder if Joyce knew about the wizard's letter? Probably not. His death wasn't ruled a homicide. Hey, girl. - It's happy hour. - I can't tonight. - I'm buying. - I'll take a rain check. - I've got a date. - One, I don't do rain checks. Two, anyone I know? Doubt it, met him at a photo gallery Downtown. He seems nice. Is he cute? Very. Yeah, no, I don't know. She's supposed to be in here. I'm already on my first glass of wine. Yeah, I'll give her a few more minutes. Oh, hi! - How are you? - Sorry I'm so late. That's all right, no problem. I had my phone to keep me company. So, tough first day? Something like that, just trying to settle in. Yeah, I understand. You know, Cara, you really ought to think about your future there. What do you mean? Books? Come on. - But that's... - Look, Let me show you something. The entire 22 volume Oxford English dictionary. In here, compressed into four megs of ram. But you miss the whole tactile sensation, The smell of the ink and paper - when you first crack open... - Listen, Cara. This is the future. It's just the start. There's a tech firm out in Seattle That's embedding microcircuits into monkeys' brains. It takes less than 3 nanoseconds to upload 'War and Peace' into the chimps' memory. And we're next. It's just a matter of time. So, you hungry? - Yeah. - Good, good, good. Hi. So... date sucked, huh? He's no Ziggy. - The man of my dreams? - Hu-huh. Let me tell you something about Ziggy, he's got some interesting qualities but... he smells funny. Really? I didn't notice anything. Next time, get closer. No, thanks. A guy's gotta smell nice, among other things. Oh, like guitar player boy? - Ed? - Oh, please. He was so cute. He was cheap. I had to pay for everything. His smell? Is the cologne I bought him. I even bought him strings. So, let me get this straight. You are looking for a relationship with... no strings attached? Or, you could... just become celibate. I am celibate. It's not all it's cracked up to be. I want passion. Ah, the dreaded 'p' word. I want my toes to tingle. You know, I think there's a personal ad in here promising just that. I want to be swept off my feet. Relax. you've got time. - You're what, 28? - Twenty-nine. I'm 31. Really? Well, you've still got your looks, honey. I'm sure Mr. Right is out there somewhere right now with flowers in one hand, down on one knee... Am I missing something here? No, it's a long story, Megan. Oh, come on, tell me. It's just... I think maybe I already let Mr. Right get away. This guy I dated in college. Alan Roberts. Why is it that I'm only hearing about this Alan Roberts right now? It's something I try not to think about. I get it. Hey, how did he smell? Great. Unfortunately. And I'm guessing he... occasionally picked up the check? More than occasionally. So what did he do? He was an artist. A painter. No, what did he do? Oh! The day before graduation, he showed up at my dorm and out of nowhere drops to his knees, whips out a ring, and says: "Cara, I can't imagine living a day without you. I love you. Marry me." What an asshole. Come on. You've gotta understand. I mean, I was 22. I wasn't ready for that sort of commitment. You said no? I didn't know what to say. And he just kept pressing me for an answer and... I didn't have one. And then he just disappeared. Well, that's not too depressing or anything. You have any pictures of this Alan guy? Or is that a stupid question? I've got boxes full. I know, you're right. Yeah, I always am. But that's all been changed. Is that right? The book's been fast-tracked for Christmas release. - This Christmas? - Yes! This Christmas. Great. Unbelievable, right? Look, this is coming directly from Joyce. - Boy, that's a surprise. - I thought it would. - All right, bye-bye. - Bye. What's the deal with those? What do you mean? There must be hundreds of editors. Thousands. Okay, thousands. And every night, each of you brings home three or four manuscripts to read. We're all searching for that perfect book. - Is there such a thing? - Yes! I don't know. I hope so. The kiss, for Claire. Their language had not yet been invented as love was a mere word. A worn cliche compared to their unique experience. What awakened within them was a phenomenon unfamiliar to each, which enclosed them like a gossamer blanket of joy. This isn't me. Who is it? I don't do this. Do what? Spend the night with a stranger. It's too quick. Too weird... Too beautiful. Wasn't it? They became addicted to their passion. Every other heartbeat was communal property And yet she discovered a fragile bliss threatened by the frightening possibility of it all dissolving in the demanding reality of life. Is anything wrong? No, I... What? Come on, tell me. Just... years from now, I was just... I'm trying to save these moments, this feeling for then. I'll be there to remind you. Will you? She felt exhilarated and simultaneously suffocated by the totality of them To the point of dreading the prospect of a meltdown leaving her with a tangible emptiness scraping her soul. Apparently, There's a renowned Japanese theater company in town performing a series of these heightened minimalist plays. It's kind of commedia, they use masks and dance and music. Anyway, I thought we'd go with Rene and Isabel... - Phillip... - tomorrow after dinner. We could go tonight but... we'd have to cancel with your mother. Philip, I... What is it, dear? I love you. Well, I love you. I love you like I have never loved anyone else, you know that and... I have done things with you that I never dreamed of. And it's gone even beyond that. Good, 'cause I'm crazy about you. I've completely lost myself in you. All I think about, all I dream about is you... - is us. - What are you saying? It's too much, Philip. We're too much. I love you. Claire, Claire. Claire! Claire! - Claire! - He stormed the streets, his personal hell of abandonment. His vanished connection to the meaning of life took the form of heated writing in hopes of alleviating the desperate pain of loss. Claire! Lifting his hand he struck the first key and... What? Lifting his hand he struck the first key and... What? I can't believe this! - Good morning. - Not yet. Julie...? Something wrong? The rest of the old manuscripts? - I threw them out. - What? Like you said. Is something missing? Just the ending to an incredible book. Incredible? I can't believe that. We're sorry. The number you have reached is no longer in service. - Please check the number... - Dammit. Do a web search. Okay. Directory assistance, what city, please? Brookdale, please. I'd like the number for a Conway Hall? Can you spell that, please? Hall, h-a-l-l. There is no listing for a hall in Brookdale. - Nothing at all? - No. Thank you. No hits. Well? He's just not cooperating. Have legal give him a call. Cara... I read it last night. What did you think? Well, I have to say, it's not exactly my taste, my, uh, cup of tea as it were. But I have to admit it has best seller written all over it, assuming it were complete and we knew where it came from. Steve, see what you Can do with it. Yes? This just came. Doesn't matter anyway. She just took it away from me. You let Joyce walk all over you? She's my boss, what am I supposed to do? Here, have another glass of wine. - No, I mean. - I now what you mean. Look, tomorrow's Saturday, Right? Get up early, rent a car. But all I've got is a post office box. It's a start, right? - But... - But nothing. Every night you search for the perfect book. Remember? - Can I get a beer here? - Just a sec. Look, if you've found it, don't give up so easily. Excuse me? Where's box 708? There is no box 708. That doesn't make sense. - Walt? - Yep? Before we remodeled, was there a box 708? Oh, you betcha. It went all the way up to 850. Would you have any information about box 708? No. Forwarding address? - A phone number? - No. We really don't keep those sort of records, miss. That was so long ago. Back when the prep school closed. Everybody moved away then. How long ago? Walt? How long ago was that? Oh, I guess... twenty years back, now. Wait a minute, you are saying that there hasn't been a box 708 in, at least... twenty years. You were here. Joyce, could I speak with you for a moment? It's about 'The Kiss'. I want to find the author. I have a whole set of problems with this. You've only been on the job ten days, - your plate this full, Cara. - I'll make the time. Well, what about the fact that Steve is a fiction editor and you are not? Joyce, give me a chance. I know this book. I'm only asking for one week. Twenty years is a long time. He could be dead. I'm willing to take that chance. You know, there are plenty of assistants that are waiting to see you screw up so that they can take your slot. Do not make me regret this. A leave of absence? Just a week. I'm the impetuous one. You're supposed to be responsible and quiet. Some example you're setting. I'm very quiet. It's just time for a little role reversal. A week, huh? You know, this sort of looks like you. - You think so? - Yeah. When I was reading the book, I actually thought it was me. Let's see. What are you doing? I want to know if you're totally whacked. - Hello? - Hi, Zig? - Yeah? - It's me, Megan. I'm shocked. I bet you are. Hey, I need a favor. - What? - Could you cover my shift for a couple of nights? - Well, I don't know. - I understand, I'll be back on Wednesday, I promise. - All right. - Great. - How are you gonna repay me? - How will I repay you? I'll think of something. Yeah, you better. - Be good. - Okay. Oh, thanks again. - Bye. - Okay, bye. We should call it a night. Since when do you get to bed before 4 a.m.? When I'm driving to brookdale first thing in the morning. Night. What about the headmaster? Do you remember his name? It was a German name. Weiss. No. Fleiss. - Bonner. - That's it. Yeah. Do you know Where we can find him? Oh sure, over at the heavenly hill cemetery. He died a couple of years after the school closed. Shit! Now what? Here you go, enjoy. Dessert? That's not what I meant. I know, but that cherry pie looks awesome. - Cara? - Yeah? The local paper. What about it? Maybe there's some kind of lead, you know, something about the school. What, a 'Dear Conway' column? You never know. It's worth a try. Excuse me? Check, please. - I'll be right there. - No cherry pie? Do you see the sacrifices I make for you? Told you it was a mess. This is why God invented the internet. You two will be all right down here? - Yeah, we'll be fine. - Alrighty. - We're just dandy. - Where do you want to start? I want to go back to the womb. My life had promise at that point. You work back. I'll work forwards. Hey, listen to this. Services will be held Thursday for Claire Naudet. Claire, like in the book. Claire Naudet, who died Monday, April 14, 1980, at brookdale hospital, after a long illness. The time frame is right. Oh, my God. She was married to Philip Naudet, English instructor at Westerberg prep. Philip and Claire, he used their real names. I think I've got it. Address or phone number would be great. How about a photo of the faculty? Donald Kellerman, Priscilla Hopewell, Ephain Mumford and Philip Naudet. Yes, all we have to do now is find him. Let's go. May I help you? - Ah, yes. Priscilla Hopewell? - Yes? We'd like to ask you a question about one of your colleagues at Westerberg prep. You with the police? No, not at all. We are trying to locate Philip Naudet. You sure you're not with the police? - Huh? - Yeah. Sorry, I can't help you. - But Mr. Kellerman... - Look... Philip and I didn't exactly see eye to eye. I have no idea where he is. But believe me, I wish I did. That son of a bitch owes me 35 bucks. Are we crazy? You tell me. You know, I don't even care if this thing ever gets published. I just want to find out how it ends. Sometimes I feel the same way. Like I don't want to share this story with the rest of the world. I want it to be all mine. Do you think they reunite? Maybe this is a clue. I thought about that but I don't know If it's supposed to show them at the beginning or at the end. End, right? It's gotta be the end. Why? Because all that searching... mean he's got to find her. Twin hearts. Twin hearts. The idea that there's one person out there who's perfect for you. Alan? It's mushy. I hate mushy. We would lie in bed at night and hold each other. His chest pressing against mine and I swear we could feel our hearts beating together as one. It's not that mushy. I've got one. Naudet? Chemistry teacher. Ephain Q. Mumford. Ah, parents can be so mean. Which one is he? The one with the mustache. He lives in Waterbury. That's about 2 inches North of here. - Let's do it. - Yep. Ziggy. You'll get us thrown out of here. Over here. Damn! - Ladies? - We're sorry to interrupt. Oh, no, no, forget about it. I've been trying for two weeks now to rescue the princess from the demon spaceship. She can wait for another hour or so. We'd like to ask you... know, I know. You're looking for Philip Naudet. Priscilla Hopewell told me all about it. You may as well just put it on the internet. She even described what you were wearing. - She told you about the book? - Yeah, and the missing ending. Philip. - Do you know where he is? - I might. Is it any good, the book? We wouldn't be here. Yeah, I suppose. Can you help us? I'm not sure he wants to be bothered. Mr. Mumford, I can't publish his book unless I find him. I'm not sure he wants to be bothered. Look, we've come a long way and we're pretty desperate. Oh, now you're threatening to beat it out of me? - No, no, I just meant... - No, that's a joke. Old man's fantasy. I've one condition. You name it. You got the manuscript With you? In here. Let me read it, tonight. - Hello? - Joyce, it's Cara. - I think I've got something. - Have you got an ending? No, not an ending, not yet, anyway, but... Did you put off "Looking for a Husband"? No, 'Looking for a Husband' is with the copy editor. We're right on schedule with that. Well, don't waste any more time. You'll be back on Monday, right? Yes, I will be there on Monday. Monday. Love you. The witch? I want to kill her. Water. Try a big bucket of water. The first thing you have to do is to be able to tell the difference between an electrolyte and a non-electrolyte. That's a no-brainer. Then you have to be able to predict the solubility of ionic compounds in water. What if he hated it? He didn't say he had to like it. Just that he wanted to read it. It's all there in chapter six. Saved by the bell. All right, for tomorrow we're going to review chapter six. You got me? Review chapter six. Mr. Mumford. The literary angels. It'd sell a million copies, wouldn't it? If I can get the ending, Yes, maybe more. You've got his number? As far as I know he doesn't have one. He lives in East Welfield. That's up the coast, on route one. I'm guessing it's about Three hours from here. A mile into east welfield, you'll see an old gas station on the right. - Does it have a name? - No, just says "old" here, underlined, and that you can't miss it. And? You're supposed to ask For him there. Sure you can't stay? One of us has to have a job. Bring back the ending, okay. I don't like to be Kept hanging. I'll do what I can. Get going. You've got a long drive. - I'll call. - You better. - Good luck. - Thanks.

What're you doing up here this time of year? I'm looking for someone. I'm hoping you can help me. I was told to ask here. Do you know where I can find Philip Naudet? - Who? - Philip Naudet. N-a-u-d-e-t. - No, never heard of him. - But... I'm sure... - this is... - Sorry. That'll be 12 bucks. Is there someone else who works here - who might be able to... - I'm afraid not. I wish I could help you. Well, drive safely, miss. Is there any place around here where I can get some food? Well, there's the diner, but it's a good hour North. Figures. I might have some crackers in the office. Right now, crackers sound great. I'm sure I have some somewhere. Wait here, miss. This is my home, miss. I'm sorry, I just followed you in and... - That should hold you. - Thank you. On me. So, you'd be on your way now, huh? Sure. You're him. - I told you I don't know this... - No, - that's you in the pictures. - No, it isn't. Yes, it is. Who sent you here? Ephain Mumford. Mumford. Mr. science, himself. - What do you want? - An ending. An ending? Yes, to... this. Where on earth did you find this? At Owens and Zeller. I work there and I think I can get it published, If you give me the missing pages. We threw them away, by mistake. Where were you 20 years ago? In fourth grade. You like it? I think it's, it's wonderful. It was our honeymoon. We kissed. - When the picture became so... - Popular? Overexposed. Every goddamn poster shop had one in their window. It stopped being us. Claire and I would imagine about these two people in front of the bookstore. How they met, the passion, the separation. In Claire's version, they were always reunited in the end. And in this one? Are you okay? Yes... time for a cigarette. The fact is, I'm a bit tired. I wonder if we could Continue tomorrow. Sure, that'll be fine. Tomorrow's fine. Just one more question. Is that a promise? Yep. Why Jake? Oh, it's the guy I bought the station from. I got dozens. You want one? No, but thanks, anyway. - I'll see you in the morning. - See you in the morning. That's him in the picture. They were on their honeymoon in Paris. You're kidding. Does he look anything like The guy in the picture? Yeah, sort of. There's something about him. Do I detect a May-December thing here? No, I don't think so, Megan. Hey, don't rule it out. Okay, I'm going To say good night now. Call me when you have an ending. Hey, Kilgore. Hey, buddy. Mr. Naudet? I've had a lot of spare time since Claire died. How many are there? I have to run into town for some groceries. You want to come? We can talk in the car. Sure. Who'll watch the station? Oh, locals need gas, they'll come by later. Come on, Kilgore, walking. Come on, man. You were pretty hard to find. That was the plan. Why? I feel more alone in company. Have you been up here long? Since the school closed. I didn't feel like teaching anymore and I, I had a little money stashed away so... But a gas station? Suits me fine. I don't do repairs, I don't sell tires. It's a perfect five minutes of interaction, then back to the typewriter. So... how many of my colleagues did you meet on this journey? Few. Priscilla Hopewell. - Donald Kellerman. - Kellerman? Hell will freeze over before he gets his 35 bucks. Damn tourists! Claire and I used to spend our vacations up here. Afterwards. It seemed like a good place To scribble. Actually, could we talk about... No, later. If I'm going to let you publish it, I should get to know you a bit first. Such as? Well, a name would be good. Oh, my god. - Cara Thompson. - Cara. It's a nice name. We're off to a good start. What do you say, Kilgore? Woof, woof. He's a cheap date. It's beautiful. Claire used to say... If you squinted, you could see the top of the Eiffel Tower from here. It was her favorite place on earth. I laid her to rest here. Come on, lad. Was she like the Claire in the book? In small ways. People just liked to be around her. When we were apart, I'd be longing for her return, but when we were together I... I couldn't relax, I was... dreading her absence. What happens at the end? You're the publishing expert. How do you think it should end? With the kiss. I should be getting back to the station. So, how much of the book is true? Oh! A lot of it. I was just trying to capture the feeling of how it was. Most of the manuscripts are the same. Just shuffling the memories around. How about their relationship? I got most of it right. Did Claire leave when I proposed? No. Probably should have, But she didn't. Was the... passion so... Overwhelming? Absolutely. And Paris? Paris... Paris I got right, at least. You seem to have a passion for book shops. Good memories. So why not get your pen name from one, Instead of Conway Hall? Oh, it was a joke. The building was falling down on our heads. An homage? To my crumbling existence. So... what are you passionate about? Books, literature. No, too obvious. Tell me something I don't know. Tell me... who in history you would have liked to have had a love affair with. - Anyone? - Anyone. Botticelli, maybe. You see yourself as Venus, - the goddess of love. - No, that's my roommate. Maybe he would have painted me after we made love. Well, that's original. And you? Me? Cleopatra. And, well, I did have a lot of fantasies about Eva Gardner. But then I remembered how was with Claire. It couldn't possibly have been better with anyone else. Hopeless, aren't I? Don't think so. So... tell me about the man in your life. There isn't one at the moment. But, please, tell me... you truly have been in love. Well... Once? Okay, once. And what did he do to make you fall so in love with him? He made me feel like... we were the only two people alive and... everything that existed, existed for us. So, where is he? I don't know. So, suddenly you weren't so... alone anymore? Not at all. What happened? I panicked. Well, we all panic. I haven't heard from him since. So find him. Who knows if he'd remember me. I think you'd be pretty hard to forget. Thank you I know a secret about cocoa. It triggers the release of endorphins. Your body's own opium. Produces the same feeling as when you're in love. So, let's eliminate love, replace it with cocoa. Heartbreak out the window. By the way, how did you meet Claire? We met in a book shop in Greenwich village. I heard this couple arguing. The guy was banging on about how TV had made books redundant. I looked over. I saw Claire clutching a book to her chest. When I saw what it was I came to her defense. I said it was the most beautiful depiction of unrequited love I'd ever read. She... she handed the book to her date and said... "Apparently, you need this more than me." What was the book? "A Sentimental Education" By Flaubert. I don't think anybody has ever got it that right, in my opinion. Until now. Oh! Silver-tongue devil. Well, listen... see for yourself. Has there been anyone since? Is that a euphemism? No. I mean... well, you're intelligent, attractive... Past my sell by date. No, having you here the last few days It's been... it's been... It's late. Maybe we better call it a night. Yeah. See you in the morning. We'll discuss the ending. I promise. We got a bit side-tracked tonight. - Good night, Philip. - Good night. Come in. That smells great. Would you like some omelet? Between the food and the cocoa, this is going to be a pleasure to edit. Perhaps not. What? You're going to stop cooking for me once I buy your book? That wasn't what I meant, exactly. You didn't lose the ending, Cara. Come, I've got something to show you. There's no ending. Happy, sad or otherwise. You sent the manuscript to Owens and Zeller incomplete? I was hoping for a response of some kind. An echo, so I'd know I wasn't alone. I guess I thought that if an editor liked the story, it would provide a spark. Give me the push I need to... to solving an ending. So here I am. Maybe that was how it was 20 years ago, but it's not like that anymore. Can't they just find each other and, and live happily ever after? It's not like that now. It is, Philip. You can finish this book. - I don't think so. - Well, at least try. I've been trying. For 20 goddamn years I've done nothing else. Let me help you. - You don't understand. - Then tell me. An ending means it's over. I'm sorry. I guess I should... leave. Hey, surprise! Oh, oh, oh, oh, I'm sorry. You don't like the poster. Get it out of here. I never want to see that picture again. Come here. Everything sucks. That's life, sister. Can I get you a drink? Beer? Gin and tonic? Whiskey straight up? Or hot cocoa? - Okay. - Please? Coming right up. So, he just wouldn't do it? Couldn't. I believe him. No, if you had met him, you'd understand. He's still not over her. Come on, Cara. You've got to be able to move on, - otherwise, you... - Die?

I'll be there tonight. - I'll see you later, then. - Okay. - Thank you. - Okay. - What's going on? - Philip... - I... - Philip Naudet. - The kiss guy? - Yeah. Tell Joyce I went home early. - But you've got a... - Tell her I was sick. Tell her anything, I don't care. He's upstairs. He... he doesn't look so good. Can I have a few minutes with my pal? I'll be right downstairs if he needs me. I guess I look pretty rough, huh? Is that morphine? Yeah... less distracting than the pain. I heard it's good to... confront what you fear most before you die. Are you referring to me? After you left I... I suddenly realized that although I've been living for years without Claire, I've never lived without the memory of her. And then there was a silence. And I just... embraced all the thoughts. Kind of vibrant peace. Empty, yet... never the same. It sounds like your luggage is packed. Yeah. And I'm traveling light. All that time I was... rummaging in the past and... the end was waiting for me in the moment. She'll be there for you. We'll see. I want you to take care of my dog. - Yeah. - Promise? Yes, promise. This is for you. Cara... It's okay. Nothing real ever dies. Twenty years. I don't see him or hear from him, and then he calls me up here to watch him die. I'm supposed to wrap up the loose ends, I guess. He told me to... send a check for 35 dollars to Donald Kellerman. All the rest of this Goes to you. Scotch on the rocks. I don't drink scotch. Good day to start. Single malt, impeccably aged, it's the bar's private stash. You know, the owner thinks none of us knows where he keeps the key. What if it's... i mean, There's no guarantee. For all I know, it could be a stack of blank pages. Bottoms up, girl. Okay? Okay. All right. In hopes of alleviating the desperate pain of loss, lifting his hand he struck the first key and wrote, "for Claire." - Bonjour. - Ah! Sales have been good, Monsieur Naudet. We sold eight copies of your book the last week alone. - Very good. - Uh-hmm. Bonjour. You waiting for someone? No. Why? No. Thank you. Monsieur, would you please sign this for me? Claire. Yes, it's me. Oh, my god, Claire. - I'm sorry. - No. I'm so sorry. I never should have left you. I... I wasted so much time. I don't even remember what I was afraid of. It doesn't matter. - What we had was... - Have, what we have. My feelings haven't changed for you. I was frightened. I was wrong to leave, I was wrong about so many things... I walked the streets of Paris until my feet bled. I wrote a book in the hopes that you'd find me and I really don't care about it because you're here now. I carry this. As he drew her close, Claire could smell the wool of his coat made wet by the warm Paris rain. With the touch of his lips all her senses dissolved and surrendered to the kiss. The kiss which reached through time itself into the boundless miraculous realm of eternity. Backed by a million dollar ad campaign, This is going to be next summer's hot book. The ending is good, Cara. Really good. At long last, I'm home. Not for long. I've got the night off. Dinner out? No, I was thinking more along the lines of... an opening. Oh, my god! Uh-uh, no. I can't go to this not tonight. No, I can't. I don't have anything to wear. No, no. Are you sure about this? Trust me. What about Kilgore? I can't leave him alone. Oh, doggie will be fine. I even got him a sitter. Speak of the devil. You remember Ziggy? Of course. - Hi. - Ziggy, this is Kilgore. Hey, buddy. - Bye, boys. - Enjoy. So that's how you repay him for covering a shift? You ask him to dog sit? He's nuts about animals. He goes to veterinarian school by day. That explains the smell. Honey, it explains a lot of things. I can't do this. I... Yes, you can, you can. Who knows if he'll even recognize me? Oh, he'll recognize you All right. How can you be so sure? Oh, my God! I think you've just been swept off your feet. What are you waiting for? - I... - Go, go. - Are you sure about this? - Go! Hi. Hi. You look good. Thank you. - So do you. - Thank you. Interesting subject. Yeah. She was a charming girl. Never get her to sit still, though. So this is quite a departure for you. Yeah. Kind of cheesy... photorealism as revenge. What do you think? Oh, it works. Good, because they're Selling like hotcakes. Bastard! I was going to invite you, but I didn't think you'd come. I'm glad I'm here. - You sure? - Yes. Good.
