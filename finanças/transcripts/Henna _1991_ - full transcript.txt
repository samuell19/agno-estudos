Subtitle synced by Anomix33 This story takes birth in the banks of the river Jhelum. That river Jhelum which starts from India and ends in Pakistan. Where a Pandit comes and prays, to the sun in the cold blue waters on this side. And on the other side, a Maulvi washes up for his prayers. Like many other creations of nature, this water doesn't differentiate between men. Then why is there a difference in people's hearts? Heena is the name of that plant of love which was nurtured by the land of one country. But no boundaries could limit her bright colour. Mattu! - Yes, sir. Have you sent the tender forms? No, Chander sir's signatures are still pending. God knows what will happen to this boy. Brother-in-law left this entire industry to this good for nothing and died. And this fool has ruined the entire business, in just two years. Chander sir has turned the industry three-fold in two years. Silence, Mattu! Not three but thirteen-fold. After all whose nephew is he? What is the matter uncle? You seem to be very happy. Why Mattu uncle? - I'm not happy but angry. Why? - Do you ever complete any work on time? When will you send this tender form? After the last date has passed? - Relax, uncle, relax! No tensions. We will do it smoothly. I have not even read this form till now. Uncle gets upset very easily. Now my friend, the captain has come, so now we'll gossip. Sorry, I'll read it later. Come Captain Surender. Hi Chander! - Bashir, get some tea. Not just tea, ask for spiced tea. - Get some spiced tea. Tell me, how are you? - First class! First class? You are an army man. I should be hospitable to you. Greetings, uncle! - Greetings dear! Surender, you are an army officer. - Yes, sir! Teach him what discipline is and what punctuality is. Him? - Come on uncle, you are now after me. Come friend, sit. You, uncle Tell me Surender, how are you? Get it quickly. Nothing much really. Just some paper works, etc. Nothing else. - It's been so long we haven't gone for a hunt. Yes! - Shall we go for hunting this evening? Why? Don't you have to meet Chandni today? Oh my God! What is the time? Hi, Chand, hi. What is the matter? You are looking very nice. I'm late are you angry! - I am happy! The biggest problem in my life is I'm not late. The delay just happens. Wear a watch, your problem will be solved. I am not habituated to it. Though it's good! If I don't have the pleasure of cajoling my angry darling then life is a waste. Isn't it? You can sweet talk a lot. Now can I ask you the reason of being late? You won't believe me. You won't believe that the tyre of such a car can get flat too. I was late because it took some time to repair it. - Is it? Then spend the rest of the evening repairing the other Tyre. The other? What do you mean? What is this childishness, Chand? Wait! Listen to me. I don't want to hear anything. This is the punishment for coming late. "Before I wake up," "oh my destiny!" "Before I wake up, oh my destiny goes off to sleep!" "I am not late, the delay just happens!" "I am not late, the delay just happens!" "This is the problem with me," "that the goal I have achieved..." "This is the problem with me that my goal I have achieved gets lost!" "I am not late, the delay just happens!" "I am not late, the delay just happens!" "Oh whom have I trusted?" "He has broken every promise he has made!" "Oh whom have I trusted?" "He has broken every promise he has made!" "Whenever I wanted to keep my promise," "whenever I wanted to keep my promise," "time has always cheated me in the nick of time!" "Time has always cheated me in the nick of time!" "Your habit of getting late," "the boat of love..." "Your habit of getting late will sink the boat of love!" "I am not late, the delay just happens!" "I am not late, the delay just happens!" "So many beautiful seasons have passed," "so many moments of romance," "so many beautiful seasons have passed!" "So many moments of romance!" "Weathers will come and go," "weathers will come and go," "I have come to cajole my angry darling!" "I have come to cajole my angry darling!" "Look, on seeing my plight," "Even the dew has shed tears!" "Look, even the dew drop sheds tears on seeing my plight!" "I am not late, the delay just happens!" "I am not late, the delay just happens!" "Before I wake up, oh my destiny goes to sleep!" "You are not late, the delay just happens!" "You are not late, the delay just happens!" Chandni! Chandni! What happened? Why are you shouting? - Shouting? If you hear what your darling daughter is doing you'll hang yourself. Why? What has she done? She leaves house on the pretext of going to college and who knows where she loiters with a loafer called Chander. Not at all papa. Chander is a good and a decent boy. I will smash your face! Do decent boys take girls from decent families to the woods? Answer me! It's possible that I take him there for a stroll. What? So things have gone this far! Chandni! - Yes? Yes, papa! - I want to meet that boy. Thank you very much papa. Thank you very much. But remember one thing, if I don't like that boy you will not meet him again in life. Understand? I agree! Shall I tell you a secret? I love you! I love you a lot! Chander, will you always harass me like this? That means you have decided to spend your entire life with me. Right? Really Chander! I have not seen a rogue like you? Beware if you see any other rogue besides me! You don't need to be so romantic. Give me your hand. Why? - Will you give me your hand or...? I will, I will. What is the matter? What is the matter? What is this? - A watch. I can see that too. But I feel very uncomfortable. I'm not used to it, Chand. If you are not, then get used to it. Because you have to come to my home sharp at 5 o' clock tomorrow. Why? - My parents want to meet you. What? Then I will stand in front of your gate an hour earlier. When it is 5 o' clock I'll enter your house playing the clarinet. Touch your parents' feet, hold your hand and ask for their blessings. We have got very little time. We... Just come on time, sir. I'll be grateful. Mummy. - What is it? Mummy. Tell me, what should I wear? Black? Orange? Yellow? You've never worn anything with my choice till today! Did you ask me before selecting the groom for yourself? Come on mother, tell me. What's this madness? Go, someone is here. Go, check! Good evening! Why did you come so early? You get angry if I come late. You get angry, if I come early. You said that your papa is very punctual. That doesn't mean you come an hour earlier. All right! I've come an hour earlier because I can take credit for it for an entire month. Nice house! Thank you! - Who is it, Chandni? This salt has moistened. It generally happens during the monsoons, aunty. You should place a blotting paper in the bottle and then keep salt. It will not moisten. My name is Chander Prakash. Oh Chander Prakash! You? - Yes! But you were to come at 5 0' clock! Seat him in the drawing room. Come on! - Yes. You... salt... Mahadev! - Don't worry. Relax! I'm your son. I'll sit with you in the kitchen. In the kitchen? - All right, what are you preparing? I'll help you too. I... you... - Relax aunt, relax. I'm in the house. In my own house! Yes, that is true, but... - Spinach! You must have made a lot of savouries, aunt. Right? Have you ever made savouries from spinach? Savouries from spinach? - This is the tragedy! People consider preparing food a simple act when it is an art. Cooking is a creative art. Isn't it? Yes, it is. But savouries of spinach?! Of course aunt! Savouries and that too made of...? - Spinach! Spinach Wow, sister-in-law, wow! You have prepared great savouries. It's of spinach. Chander has taught me. - Of spinach? Yes. Because cooking is a creative art? Isn't it? Yes! If you have finished talking about savouries of spinach shall we start talking about ginger pudding or onion deserts? It's obvious that you will get angry. Because you cannot even prepare a cup of tea yourself. Why can't I prepare? But on the condition that you will have the tea prepared by me. So young man, you travel everyday for 2 hours from Baramullah to Srinagar to meet Chandni. Yes! Oh no, sir. Actually I have to come regarding the estate work, sir. Then I meet Chandni too. Okay! - Yes! So you think that while you are here on work, you might as well meet Chandni too. That's not how it is. Actually I come to meet Chandni and my work gets done too. Yes, I see. - Yes! That means your work happens on the side, when you come to meet Chandni. Otherwise work is not that important for you. Why won't be work important? Work is work. In fact for me... All right. - Yes. Meeting Chandni is not very important. No sir, it is not that. Actually, I got it. I got it. You're just trying to confusing me. What am I doing to you? Yes? Nothing. I'm sorry sir. Yes? - What? No, I thought you said something to me. Will you wait now? - Yes. No, I will leave. I... Enough Rajan sir! This is enough. Young man, actually this rascal has already found out, everything about you. Whatever he's doing is just an act. He has already chosen you. - What? Papa. - Sir this... Chandni, won't you see Chander off? Yes, papa. - Thank you. Thank you for what? Because you confused me. - Papa! I will take your leave. Good night. - Come! Tell me, how is it? - Very good. Fix the date. What do you say sir? You broke into sweat before papa. You became so nervous! You won't believe me, if I tell you the truth. The way cooking was necessary to impress your mother. Similarly, all that was necessary to win your father. That I whimpered and stammered before him. Otherwise am I scared of anybody? I was just acting. Let it be. You are not such a good actor. What do you mean? - I mean, what you are doing now... Yes. - This is acting! You were absolutely flustered before papa. Hey, what happened? The truth is dear, that for a moment I felt everything is over. I lost my Chand. Chander! Yes, Chand! That moment I realized, how precious you are to me. That I won't be able to live without you, if I had to lose you or get estranged from you. Enough! Enough, Chander! I cannot live away from you, Chand! I can't live! Come on, sit in the cars. Take some luggage too. Come! Chander dear. - Yes! We are going to Srinagar with the engagement gifts. Yes. - You come with Mattu. Uncle, why don't I come with you too? You should be ashamed. - Why? Does the groom reach before everybody else? Look at your face. Shave and have a bath. Shaving takes just 2 minutes uncle. You leave too. Who will take this? Uncle, take this too. Uncle, uncle. I will also get ready. Please. - Silence! Leave from here at 5 sharp. Don't be late at all. - Uncle! Quickly, sit in that car. Balli! The lights have not been arranged yet. Ramu go quickly and call them. - Yes, sir I will just do it. The stage has still not been decorated. The work here will be done. Go upstairs and look at the rest of the arrangements. Come with me. What is this? Siren! Chander! - What's this siren uncle? One of our workers has injured himself badly. Oh my God! Come! Oh my God! Fill petrol and get my car. - Get my car! Hurry up! Come quickly. Come! Wow! May God ward off the evil eye. My daughter is looking just like a princess. That boy is very lucky. If you see the boy you'll say, our Chandni is very lucky, aunty. Mr. Chander Prakash! The situation is under control. Don't worry! - Thank you! Sir, you can leave. I'll manage the rest here. I'll leave! Daughter is already here, Rajan. But why has Chander not arrived yet? His uncle and Surendra have gone to call up and find out. What happened? - Chander has left, uncle. Let's go! "When will you come?" "When will you come?" "Will you come? when my life leaves my body?" "You might be too late!" "You might be too late!" "Come, my heart is fluttering!" "You might be too late!" "You might be too late!" "Everyone wants to know where the life of the party is!" "Everyone wants to know where the life of the party is!" "Everyone wants to know where the life of the party is!" "They repeatedly ask me why you have not come!" "You might be too late!" "You might be too late!" "For every thing there is a fixed time!" "There is an appropriate time for every task!" "There is an appropriate time for every task!" "Everything is lost if the time has passed." "It's the time that's important!" "You might be too late!" "Come, my heart is fluttering!" "You might be too late!" "Dark clouds blocked my path," "at times, the wind surrounded me!" "Dark clouds blocked my path," "at times, the wind surrounded me!" "Even the lightning glowered at me!" "Even the lightning glowered at me!" "The weather has shown its attitude!" "The weather has shown its attitude!" "All the motives and promises!" "The rain," "The rain washes away," "all my promises and motives!" "I'm not late, the delay just happens!" "I'm not late, the delay just happens!" "You might be too late!" "Come, my heart is fluttering!" "You might be too late!" "I gave you my heart, which was the height of trust!" "I gave you my life, which was the height of love for you!" "I died, my eyes remained open," "that was the height of waiting for you!" "This is the limit!" - "Come!" "My life is at stake!" - "Come!" "The stage is set!" - "Come!" "Only you are missing!" - "Come!" "You might be too late!" "You might be too late!" "Come, my darling! I'm waiting for you!" "Come, my darling! I'm waiting for you!" "I'm waiting for you!" "Come, my darling! I'm waiting for you!" "Come, my darling!" "Come, my darling! I'm waiting for you!" "I cannot take my eyes off the door, come!" "Come to the call of the heart, come!" "Coming late may be your habit!" "Even if you come late, at least come!" "Even if you come late, at least come!" "Come, my darling! I'm waiting for you!" "Come! Come!" "Come, my darling! I'm waiting for you!" "Come, my darling! I'm waiting for you!" "Come, my darling!" "Come, my darling! I'm waiting for you!" "I'm waiting for you!" "Come, my darling! I'm waiting for you!" "Come, my darling! I'm waiting for you!" "Come, my darling! I'm waiting for you!" "Come, my darling! I'm waiting for you!" "Come, my darling! I am waiting for your arrival!" Chandni! Why did you scream? - Mummy! What's the matter, daughter? What happened? Something has happened. Something has surely happened. God, protect my Chander! Careful, Ramana! Careful, the flow of the water is very fast. If he falls down he'll reach Pakistan, that too without a passport. "You possess beauty..." "You are the leader of all mankind" "It is because of your enlightened countenance" "That the moon is illuminated." "It is impossible to praise you in a befitting manner" "After God..." "You are the greatest." "Welcome, my Liege Lord, Medinan of the Arabs." "Welcome, my Liege Lord, Medinan of the Arabs." "My heart and my soul belongs to you." "My heart and my soul belongs to you."

"Welcome, my Liege Lord, Medinan of the Arabs." "Welcome, my Liege Lord, Medinan of the Arabs." "I'm lively Henna!" "Cute, lively Henna!' "There is no colour without me in this valley!" "I'm lively Henna!" "Cute, lively Henna!' "I am a gypsy, the entire world is my nation!" "I am a gypsy, the entire world is my nation!" "Love is my language, it's my expression!" "Love is my language, it's my expression!" "To love is a part of my life, Heena!" "I'm lively Henna!" "Cute, lively Henna!' "I am the company of childhood," "I am the friend of youth!" "I am the company of childhood," "I am the friend of youth!" "Those hands that wore me, were wedded," "Those hands that wore me, were wedded," "every married lady says that your company is lucky, Heena!" "I'm lively, Henna!" "Cute, lively Henna!' Ashraf! That was Heena's voice! Come, let's go! Imran! Arbaz! Karim! Rahim! - Come, all of you! Imran! - Come here all of you! Come! My daughter is in danger! Father! Heena, daughter! What? What happened? Father, look there. There, in the water. Ashraf, Zaman, Razak, lift him up. Khan sir, he is still alive. Alive? Khalid, inform Bibigul to come to my house immediately. Come! What happened to your skills, Bibi Gul? the morning has turned into evening and he's still unconscious. What? You do one thing Khan sir. Call a foreign doctor from the hospital in town. He will cure him at once. - I didn't mean that Bibi Gul. So what? What did you mean? 'I didn't mean that.' He has become soggy like a ball of wet mud in the water. If you put wet dough in the oven even that requires some time to become bread. It cannot be prepared just like that. You want him to open his eyes and stand up at once. Only that foreign doctor can perform such miracles. I can't! Move! - Hey, Bibi Gul. Listen to me. Oh aunt Gul, no one has the magic, your hands possess. Yes, your aunt Gul is a fool, isn't she, that she'll be fooled by you! Ashraf! Move out of my way. - No! I'll beat you up. No! Aunt Gul! One shouldn't get so annoyed. I forgot to give the medicine. Mix this medicine in a glass of milk and make him drink it. Hey girl, take this! Only tonight is critical. If he passes it by the grace of God, he's saved. He will surely be saved. - Yes. You, move from here. Yes. God forbid, if his body grows cold, then heat the mustard oil and tell your father to rub it nicely on his palms. It heats up the blood. - Yes, aunt! He has come to teach Bibi Gul her skills. Good bye, Bibi Gul! - Yes! Goodbye! Goodbye, aunt Gul! - Goodbye! God is great! Father! He has regained consciousness, father. Is it? - Come, come quickly, father. Father ask him, if he doesn't know how to swim why did he jump into the water? Son, how are you? Hey, he has again lost consciousness. Daughter, go and inform Bibi Gul. - Yes, father. Noori! You are here. Come, aunt has asked for milk for the patient. She says that he's absolutely out of danger now. He's unconscious. But his pulse and breathing is absolutely okay. Isn't it a good news? But you're strange, Noori. You don't care about anything. Neither happiness nor sorrow. Do you know everyone has been busy since yesterday? Aunt made fed him a lot of herbs. But to no effect. But when I massaged his palms, he regained consciousness. Noori, I went crazy with delight. Oh my dear, you're being so kind to this dumb animal. You could have been kind to this poor man too. Oh inspector, when did you come? I didn't even notice you. That is the problem, dear, that you never notice me. Oh my God! God has created you with great care. What do you mean by that inspector? Meet me somewhere outside, I'll tell you the meaning. Okay, I will ask father and come. Where shall I meet you? - Hell! What took you so long to get milk? Shahbaz Khan? Greetings Khan sir! How are you? God is merciful! Why did you come today? How can I serve you now? The fact is, some of our senior officers, have come to inspect this area. If I get an animal today, they will have a splendid feast. Certainly! But officers? Inspection? Is everything okay? You're aware that, two nights ago there was a huge storm. Taking advantage of such stormy nights, the spies of our neighbouring enemy, invade our boundaries. Then our spies must be going too. Isn't it? - May be. Being with neighbours in their distress and joy, Sending them sweets on festivals is heard of. But why this custom of sending spies? You don't know our neighbours, Khan sir. They are butchers. If someone unwittingly bows his head before them they quickly chop it off. But we also know how to pay them back in their own coin. Whenever we catch one of their spies we beat them and force them to reveal the truth. Then we hang the rascal. Oh my God! Go quickly and give the milk to Bibi Gul. She wants to mix it with medicine and give him. Yes, father! Is everything okay? Who is ill? There's one child. There's always something happening in such a big family. But you don't worry. Ashraf. - Yes! Go to Zaman's house and place a goat in sir's jeep. All right. It's something to think about Shahbaz Khan. Is a lifeless line drawn by men on a piece of paper so strong that it wipes out love created by God in human hearts and fills it with suspicion and hatred? It's very sad. This is not about emotions, Khan sir, but about politics. You won't understand. - You're right. How will people who talk of humanity understand politics? Isn't it? I'm leaving. Goodbye! Goodbye! Sir, you're still here and my wife is sitting at home with the food prepared. Please come! I will have food on the way, Shahbaz Khan. I was just waiting to tell you that we're wearing this uniform to serve and protect the people. It's obvious, sir. You don't have to say it. It's necessary, Shahbaz Khan. I have also heard that you harass innocent and, helpless people unnecessarily. Some enemy has poisoned your mind, sir. This is a lie. Absolutely wrong! You can ask Nawabdeen. I just want to warn you. Think about it. Goodbye! Sir has spoken very harshly. To hell with the superintendent! How far has the rascal progressed with his medal of honesty? He is rotting been there for the last 15 years! Nawabdeen.! - Sir! Find out who has complained about this. - Sir! My name won't be Shahbaz Khan if I don't skin him and sell his flesh and the meat market. Father! Look aunt! He has again regained his senses. - Thank God! Absolutely! What did I say? If God wills, the child will completely recover. - Amen! Taking advantage of such stormy nights, our neighbour pushes in their spies inside our boundaries. What are you doing? You have such deep wounds. Even your leg is broken, dear. You can't start walking in just two days. Just lie down, dear! Who? This is Bibi Gul, dear. She has treated you. - Live long, dear. How are you? Khan sir, ask him something about himself too. Yes, tell me dear. Who are you? What's your name? Which village do you belong to? What's your name? Name? Yes, name! Like he is Khan sir. I am Ashraf. You must have a name too. Why don't you tell us? Don't be scared, dear. Your family must be worried. We will have to inform them too. How will that be possible if you don't tell me anything? Dear, do you at least remember, how you fell in the lake? I don't remember anything. I don't remember anything. - Oh God! Stop this drama! - Ashraf. He's lying, Khan sir! He remembers everything. Actually, he doesn't want to tell us anything. - Ashraf. God! Leave him. Have you gone mad? He's acting, Khan sir. - Get out. I say, get out! Get out! Why don't you understand his game? He's acting. I can't remember anything. I can't remember anything. I can't remember anything. Tell me Bibi Gul. What's your opinion? Khan brother, I feel the child is telling the truth. Maybe he has forgotten everything about his last life. How is that possible, aunt? It is possible, Ashraf. The way a person loses his mind because of some shock, becomes insane. It happens, right? In the same way, a person sometimes loses his memory due to injury in his head. But it is also possible that he is pretending to lose his memory. Yes, it's possible. Why not? But you have also seen Ashraf the condition we found him. The injuries on his body weren't fake. Nor was his death-like state. Bibi Gul is absolutely right, Ashraf. It was God's will to send him to us. He made us the medium for giving him a new life. Shall we turn away from this responsibility? Its not right to be emotional regarding this, Khan sir. I think it will be better to hand this boy over to the police. Don't you remember what the inspector said? Who knows? He might be a spy too. What? Spy and him? That scoundrel inspector said something and you believed him?! Ashraf, have you even seen the faces of spies? Are they so true and innocent? Now this is no reason, aunt. Even Satan looked like an angel earlier. When the truth was out, he turned out to be a messenger from hell. Khan sir, this boy might make our life hell. Because, if he is a spy then all of us will be proven guilty in the eyes of the law. If he's not a spy then as soon as we hand him over to the police, they will torture him and beat him up badly, forcing him to say something. What he will the poor man say? He doesn't remember anything. Then we'll be guilty in the eyes of God whose law is far above any law made by man. Do you want that, Ashraf? Khan sir, I... - What? All right Khan sir, as you wish. Tell me, what do I have to do? All right, you, Razak and Zaman go to the few villages near by and ask them. Maybe he's from any of those villages. This is the same number you had reported Rajan sir. But what happened to Chander? We don't know. If this is the state of the car what chance does a weak human have? No, don't say that, uncle. Nothing can happen to my Chander. Find him. Please find him! I can understand what you mean, dear. But no one knows where Chander has been swept away in such a terrible storm. No! Mother! Did you wash your face properly? Show me. Well done. Come on, have your milk quickly. Take it. It's hot! So much? - It is Aunt Gul's order. You've been on bed for a week. How will you become strong again, if you don't have milk? I've also asked Noori to give more milk everyday. Noori? Is it aunt Gul's daughter? Oh no! she's our goat. But not just an ordinary goat. She's one among millions. She just looks like the moon. Chand! Aunt is absolutely alone in this world. Her husband and son were killed in an accident a few years ago. Aunt is a potter. She makes pots and utensils of clay. But God has given her great skills. She is matchless. All the villagers from nearby villages go to her for treatment. It's a different matter that you actually regained you senses when I massaged your hand. - Chand! Chand! Chand! Why are you repeating Chand, over and over again? I don't know. This word seems familiar. Is it? You're surely regaining your memory. Think! Remember! Chand. - Is it someone's name? Maybe. Is it your name? - My name? Yes, what can be more familiar than your own name? My name? I am sure that your name is Chand! After all you are so cute. I'll go and tell everyone that you remember your name. They'll be very happy. Father! He remembers his name, father. His name is Chand! - Chand? Kanu, Lali, Soni, he has recalled his name. His name is Chand! Resham, Akbari! His name is Chand. He has recalled his name. Who are you going to dazzle this early in the morning, dear? Oh, inspector, you? How did you come here? Have you finished the hens you'd taken yesterday? You are so innocent. I don't come here to buy hens. They is just an excuse. Oh God! You make excuses to take hens, inspector? No, dear, I make excuses to look at you. Why inspector? I haven't committed any crime. Oh dear, you have committed a crime which no other has. Ask my heart. You've killed me. Inspector you talk in a very crooked manner. Can't you ever talk straight? I'm leaving! The sick man must be alone at home. From where did you adopt this sick person? These delicate flower like hands, treating the sick. Who is this patient? Is he someone special? Yes. He is our own. You know our Haseena aunt who had camped on the mountains last year. Do you remember? He's her son, Chand. He had climbed trees in the rain to cut wood. His leg slipped and he fell into the river. Thank God, he was saved. - He's unlucky. After being saved from the lake, he was killed in the house. Now lightning will strike him so hard that he'll be reduced to ashes. What do you mean? I mean, that if you place this beautiful face of yours before him all the time, will he ever get cured? If he falls prey to your beauty, he may even lose his life. Oh God! - Did you understand what I said, dear? I understood, inspector. I'll leave now. It's time for his medicine. Wait dear, listen to me. - Later, inspector! She is gone. Treat this patient of yours too sometimes. Well, sometime later then. Oh God! What are you doing here standing with a stick? What if you had fallen? - That... This? What is this? Aunt asked you to walk without a stick. She has, right? - Yes. Then throw it. If you don't show courage, how will you ever recover? Oh my God! What happened? Why did you cover your face? I know very well, why you're not healing fast. - Why? Oh! Will you ever get cured, if I hover around you with this pretty face? I didn't get it. What are you saying? - No. If you fall prey to my beauty. Oh God! What will I tell God then? Look, never fall prey to my beauty. Understand? Oh no! I cannot understand - Heena! Heena! Coming, father! Oh God! I'm dead! Ouch! My hand! Is this is something to laugh about? I won't speak to you. But daughter what happened to you? How did you think of wearing a veil longer than yourself? All this has happened because of that inspector. Who? That rascal, Shahbaz Khan? - Who else? He started talking strangely. He was asking questions about the sick man. What questions, daughter? That who is the sick person? Is it someone special? What did you say then? - I said he's Haseena aunt's son. He fell in the river while cutting wood and that's it!. Why did you do that? Why did you lie? Who knows how many more lies we'll have to speak to support this lie? - Forget it, Ashraf. She's a child. She has committed a mistake. Even God forgives the lie told to save someone. But Khan sir people like Shahbaz Khan don't. What about him? He'll get well tomorrow and go away. We'll be left to be punished. Ashraf, wait. Where are you going? I'm sorry. You were scolded because of me. No problem! Don't mind Ashraf's words, brother. He's sharp tongued but not bad hearted. Greetings Bibi Gul! Greetings Khan brother! Come! Look, who has come to meet you! - Greetings, aunt Gul! Greetings. Chand! Good God! Sit! Aunt, today when he set his foot out of the house for the first time, he wanted to meet you before anyone else. - Is that so? Aunt, he came here walking all the way on his own feet, without any support. - Is it? Yes! Well done! May God give you good health, dear. Live long! Aunt, you've given me a new life. Your position in my heart will always be close to that of my mother who gave birth to me. My life will remain indebted to your love and service. Crazy! one shouldn't be ungrateful to God. God is the one who gives and takes life. We're just his instruments. Okay, listen! You have had lots of medicines prepared by aunt Gul. Have some rice pudding today. Okay? I'll just get it. Wow! Today's a really lucky day. One should learn flattery from you. Have this, dear. Heena dear, have some. Bibi Gul, you have treated him. Today you have made him eat such a wonderful pudding. Now do one more favour on the child. - Favour? What is it? He is very self-respecting. He said, since I'm fine now I'll work. - All right! You know, till he doesn't become completely well it won't be right to send him out of the village. So let him work at your place. It'll be good. Give him whatever wage you think is right. Yes, why not Khan brother? I'll teach him to make such good pots that he will soon earn good money. Dear, start today itself. - All right aunt. Aunt, may I have another bowl of pudding? Why not? Really Khan sir. Aunt prepares such great pudding. So delicious that I feel like kissing her hand. I've thought about it, Noori. I'm not going to do his work from today. I served him day and night! But nobody values me! Now I'll have fun! He'll starve! But I won't cook! Look at him! He got well! And he first went to meet aunt! He said 'aunt I will forever remain indebted to you.' What about Heena's toil? Nothing! Noorie! You too gave him so much milk! But did he even come to thank you? No! Day and night I cooked delicious food for him! Today aunt gave him some sweets he said aunt cooks such delicious sweets that I feel like kissing her hand. Did he ever feel like kissing Heena's hand? No! But Noorie... You? Happy? Come, Heena! What brings you here at this hour? I've come to take water. What else? - Without the pot? This absent mindedness! This pale face. Are you fine? Resham, I think, Heena has fallen ill treating that patient. Shut up! You must be ill! What's wrong with me? This ailment can not be seen. It attacks the heart! Heart? Yes! Then it arouses sweet pain. It shows some dreams. Then the day comes when a person loses herself and belongs to somebody else. Oh my God! What ailment is this? This ailment is called love, Heena. Is love some ailment? Only the person who has given you this ailment can explain it better. Who? The one who was your guest and has now stolen your heart. Khan Baba is nowhere to be seen. Has he gone out? Today is the market day. They have all gone there. - Oh yes! Have a seat. I'll get milk for you. Is this tea? - Yes! I'm tired of having milk everyday. Can I get a cup of tea today? Yes, why not? Have a seat. I'll just get it. - Okay! Do you have enough for you too? - Yes! I'll just get it. Yes! - Here! Having tea after so many days feels so great. Am I right? Yes, absolutely! Chand, do you know what love is? Love? Love is that great feeling created by God which resides within each person. Not that. I am talking about that special love. The one that attacks the heart. - Attacks? Yes! Then it arouses sweet pain. Then I don't know what happens. One person belongs to another. I see! That! That love happens when a stranger appears to be your own. Then you start liking him so much that you feel like giving him everything that you have! How? It's like assume that you have only one cup of tea. And you are craving to have it! But when that stranger asks for that tea, you immediately give it to him. And you get happy even without having that tea. Oh my God! What happened? No, no, nothing! "Your love has made me crazy, a callous one!" "Your love has made me crazy, a callous one!" "It made me crazy!" "I don't like it anywhere!" "It made me crazy!" "I don't like it anywhere!" "Your love has made me crazy, a callous one!" "Your love has made me crazy..." "I don't know where I am and where my heart is," "I don't remember anything besides you!" "I see you everywhere, beloved!" "You have made me ignorant of the world!" "You have made me ignorant of the world!" "It made me crazy!" "I don't like it anywhere!" "It made me crazy!" "I don't like it anywhere!" "Your love has made me crazy, a callous one!" "Your love has made me crazy..." "Your love has put me in such a plight, beloved!" "I don't know where I'm walking," "I have got new happiness, It's your grace!" "You have made me ignorant of my path," "You have made me ignorant of my path," "It made me crazy!" "I don't like it anywhere!" "It made me crazy, I don't like it anywhere!" "Your love has made me crazy, a callous one!" "Your love has made me crazy..." These people don't understand anything. Now you only explain to them. It's a complicated matter. I'll have to think. - Greetings, Khan Baba! Greetings, Ashraf. Did you find out anything? No, Khan Baba! I have inquired at all the villages across the border. Nobody is missing there too. All the guys named Chand are present at their home. Now what will we do, Khan Baba? I don't know, dear. I did what I could. Now whatever God wills. Chand, don't make haste. - No! Slowly, dear. - Okay! If you press too hard, the mud will get spoilt. - Okay! Yes! Very good! Hey! Najma! - Yes! For the past half an hour you've been looking at the pots. Didn't you like even one? I'm going to pay for the pot. I have to assure myself. Assure yourself! What is this? It's a pot! What else? Pot? So crooked? This is the first pot that Chand has made. You can buy another one. I'll look for another one. Only a crazy one will buy this. You carry on dear. Greetings, aunt! Greetings, dear! What brought you here? My pot has broken. I've come to buy another one. Fine! Choose any one. Very good! Aunt, how much for this one? This one is for free, dear. Take it. What? Had you told me earlier, I would've taken it. It's not so bad! Hey! I won't give this even for a million! Understand? Greetings, aunt.! - Greetings, dear! What happened? Nothing, father. The pot broke. - But how? What do you mean? It's made of mud. It fell and broke. No problem! Now I'll have to get another one from aunt's place. Yes, I'll tell her. She will send one. No, no! I'll go myself! Now that I'm paying, I should choose a good one. That too is right. Go and get it yourself. Fine, father! Greetings! - Greetings! Greetings, aunt! Greetings! What's the matter, Heena? Did your pot break again? Aunt, how did you come to know? I just know. Go and select a pot. Okay, aunt! Aunt, I'm leaving. Greetings! Okay. Greetings! Greetings, Khan! Greetings, Gul! What brought you here? I thought I'll inform you... - Yes! God knows how many pots, Heena has recently bought from me. Have you come to take the money? Oh no! I've come to say... - Yes! This series of the pots breaking and buying will go on, if you don't do something. Let Heena come. I'll ask her. What? What will you ask? Why did you become marriageable age without asking me? What do you mean? - Its amazing, Khan! When children grow old, others come to know first and the family members, later. Greetings, Khan Baba! Greetings, Shahbaz Khan! Come! Have a seat. Where are you going early in the morning, all dressed up? I had come to meet you, Khan Baba. I want to talk to you about Heena. About Heena? What has she done? No, Khan Baba. Nothing serious. Your daughter is a gem. A fortunate precious gem. Whether it's fortunate or unfortunate, depends on whose finger it is on, inspector. But if you try to devour it, then besides cutting your intestines you won't achieve anything. If I had to devour it, I wouldn't have come to seek Khan Baba's permission. Khan Baba, I want to marry Heena. So were you a bachelor till now, inspector? No! I've married twice. My first wife died and I didn't like the second one. As it is we are permitted to marry four times. But Khan Baba, if you say then I'll divorce my wife. Divorce? Why? Is she ill? Or she can't conceive? God forbid! I have 7 children! Oh! Then she must be a characterless woman! What rubbish, Gulbano! The thing is that I don't love my wife. I only love Heena. If in the future you got bored of Heena too, then will you leave her and marry the fourth time? Tell me! - But Khan Baba, I... No, Shahbaz Khan! The laws and norms of Islam have not been formed, so that men take undue advantage of that and play with women's life! No! The law has been formed to give love, respect and shelter to women. Don't dishonour it like this! Khan Baba, I just know that I had come here with good intentions. Don't take your decision in haste. Think about it. I'll provide a luxurious life to your Heena. I will load her with clothes and jewellery. A man like me can come to your aid during bad times. Or else I'll leave now. I'll come again after my night rounds. Goodbye! You were right, Gul. When kids grow up, others come to know first and family members later. I only want to say that, before this inspector creates some new problem you must get Heena married. I'm ready. But with whom? Who else? Our Chand! He's a nice and decent guy. He's hard working and sincere. The most important factor is Heena loves him, Khan. That's what I had come to tell you. But we don't know anything about his background or his family. He doesn't even remember anything. That means he'll forever stay here with us. I've given it a lot of thought. If Heena marries Chand, not only will your daughter be near you, but you'll get a son too. It will protect Heena from this evil inspector's sight too. Nobody will doubt that Chand doesn't belong to our tribe. So? I will have to think Gul. I'll have to think. Uma! Chandni! Have sweets! I've brought good news! Good news? Papa! You found out about Chander! My Chander has come! My Chander! Chander! Oh my papa! Sweet papa! Mummy, what did I say? He comes late, but he does come. I am so happy! Have sweets! Listen to me! Papa, I forgot about you! You too have sweets! Papa, Chander has come! That's not what it is. What? Then why have you brought sweets? Sudha has passed her exams. Yes! You all celebrate! You all have a feast! If Chandni is dying, let her die! - Chandni! Why don't you search for my Chander? Why don't you find him for me? We have searched dear. We have! But how will we find the one who's no more? What do you mean, mummy? What do you mean he's no more? Chander! Did Chander vanish into thin air? Chandni, try to understand. What do I understand, papa? You tell me! Did he vanish into thin air? Why don't you answer me? Why are you quiet? Chandni! - Bring my Chander! Stop this madness! - I want my Chander! I said... Chandni! Beat me! Kill me! Strangulate me and throw my body somewhere! But don't talk rubbish about my Chander! Don't talk rubbish about him! Don't! Stop this nonsense! Enough of this madness! Chander is dead! - No papa! He's dead! He's dead! - No papa! My Chander will come! My Chander will surely come, mummy! My Chander will come! No! No! No! My child! Is somebody there? Help! No! - Heena, come quickly! Help! Khan Baba! Help! My child! No! Save my child! Save my child! The leapard has taken away my child! Save my child! God, help me! Kamal! Irfan! Come! My child! My child is fine! Thank you, God! Don't worry! - Look! They're coming! Razak! - He saved the child. Najma, here's your child. Thank God! Chand risked his life and saved him at the right time. Really, sister-in-law. Chand had a perfect aim! Chand, we'll forever remain indebted to you. You all are embarrassing me. As it is I am burdened by your favours and... No, dear! Today you have repaid all the favours of this tribe. So you are Chand, who night you fell into the river. You drive the jeep. You know how to shoot too. Can I ask you from where you learned all this? Here many people drive jeeps. They use gun too. You never interrogated them. So today why are you questioning Chand? It's a policeman's job to question every stranger, Khan Baba. But now here nobody is a stranger. Chand is not only my sister's son. He's also Heena's fiance. Day after tomorrow will be the henna ceremony and, the marriage will be on Friday. If you have time do visit. You too are invited. Thanks a lot, Khan Baba. Greetings! What did you say, Khan Baba? Heena's marriage with Chand? If you have lied to clear Shahbaz Khan's doubts... This is not a lie, Ashraf. I've taken this decision after careful thinking. Heena will marry Chand. No, Khan Baba. This is not right. How can you get your daughter married to a man who remembers nothing and who has no future? Just think, Khan Baba. I don't have any hometown or family or a house. Who says so? From today you are my son Chand and, my house is your house. Now tell me. - No, aunt! What's the matter son? Don't you like Heena? No, Khan Baba. It's not that. Heena is a girl who can fill a person's life with happiness. But I'm not worthy of her, Khan Baba. I'm not worthy of her! Ask Heena how worthy you are. Look, girls! The groom's dress has arrived! Wow! - Let's see! Let's see! Show me! Show us! Such lovely attire! Look at this golden embroidery! It's so pretty, isn't it? Matching golden laced shoes. These shoes are not for the groom to wear. It is to beat Heena! Get lost! You'll be beaten up! That too with old, tattered shoes! What is this? Cap! Our groom will look like a nut, if he wears this! Not a nut, he'll look like a first-rate fool! Get lost! Your fiance will look like a fool! He'll look like a prince. Seeing him everybody will feel jealous. Beloved wearing red silk cap... Did you all hear that? She's going to get married to him. "Beloved! Beloved!" "I will marry the one with the red silk cap!" "Beloved! Beloved!" "I will marry the one with the red silk cap!" "Beloved! Beloved!" "Beloved! Beloved!" "I will marry the one with the red silk cap!" "Beloved! Beloved!" "This cap, this handsome face!" "This cap, this handsome face!" "The flowery veil on the groom's head!" "The flowery veil on the groom's head!" "I will die! I will die!!" "I want to die with you!" "Beloved! Beloved!" "I will marry the one with the red silk cap!" "God has been grateful on love!" "God has been grateful on love!" "God heard Heena's prayers!" "God heard Heena's prayers!" "Heena's prayers!" "Thanks! Thanks!" "God, thanks a lot!" "Beloved! Beloved!" "I will marry the one with the red silk cap!" "The thread of love pulls me!" "The thread of love pulls me," "you are ahead and I'm following you!" "you are ahead and I'm following you!" "Following you!" "I have left! I have left," "For you I have left the whole world!" "Beloved! Beloved!" "I'll marry the one with the red silk cap!" "Beloved! Beloved!" "Beloved! Beloved!" "I will marry the one with the red silk cap!" "Beloved! Beloved!" "I will marry the one with the red silk cap!" "Beloved! Beloved!" "Let's celebrate." "Let's celebrate." "Let's celebrate." "Let's celebrate." "Let's celebrate." "Let's celebrate." "It is the night of wishes!" "It has brought the colours of henna!" "Sing and dance and say God!" "It's the groom's wedding! Dance and say God!" "Let's celebrate." "Let's celebrate." "Let's celebrate." "Let's celebrate." "Let's celebrate." "Let's celebrate." "Perfume has arrived from the groom's house!" "Perfume has arrived from the groom's house," "it has made the whole world fragrant!" "It has made the whole world fragrant"! "The bride has come all decked up!" "The bride has come all decked up!" "Let's sing, dance and celebrate." "Let's celebrate The beloved groom." "Let's celebrate." "Let's celebrate." "Let's celebrate." "Let's celebrate." "Let's celebrate." "Let's celebrate." "It is the night of wishes!" "It has brought the colours of henna!" "Sing and dance and say God!" "It's the groom's wedding! Dance and say God!" Chand! Chand! What happened, son? "Before I wake up," "my luck goes to sleep!" "I don't come late," "the delay just happens!" What happened? Say something. You! All of you... I had met with an accident. I was going to get engaged. No! Not engagement. Today is the henna ceremony and your marriage is on Friday. With Heena! Heena? Who Heena? I'm going to marry Chand not Heena. Chand? What are you saying, dear? Your name is Chand. Not mine. It's my fiancee's name. Chandni! I lovingly call her Chand. What? - Yes! Oh God! Khan, I think he has regained his memory. Memory? Yes! Tell me. What's your name? Chander! Chander Prakash! Chander Prakash? - Yes! Why? Look! Look I don't understand all this. I was driving I... I... Look, I don't know how I reached here. But some people are waiting for me there. I have to reach Srinagar immediately. Srinagar? Yes. My Chand lives there. Why? Oh God! Look, I don't understand. So you are an Indian? So? So what? We all are Indians. No! We are Pakistanis and right now you are in Pakistan. In Pakistan? How is that possible? Don't pretend! Betrayer! Cheater! Fraud! Tell me! What did you get by playing with innocent Heena's life? Why did you entice her in your charade of love? Why? What are you saying? It's wrong! It's a lie! Yes! It's a lie! This feast in the village is a lie! Khan Baba's bowed head is a lie! Am I right? Heena sitting behind the curtain, the henna on her hand is a lie! No! Only you are wrong here! You! Your ill-fated life! Your existence that I will end today! I'll kill you! Ashraf! Beware! Ashraf! Leave him! What are you doing? Leave him! I'll kill you! I'll kill you! Beware if you raise your hands on him! Khan Baba, you still want to save him? Right from the beginning I've been saying not to trust a stranger so much! So many times I asked to hand him over to the police! But you didn't listen to me! Did you see? Did you see the result of your trust? Today it has been revealed that he's an Indian. Tomorrow it will be revealed that he's a spy, Khan Baba! Spy?! No! I'm not a spy! I'm ready to go to the police and reveal my truth right now! I'll break your leg! If you leave the village! - Ashraf! You still don't understand his craftiness, Khan Baba! He has deceived all of us! He very well knows that the police will question us, not him! Shahbaz Khan will question Heena! He'll question you, Khan Baba! Why did you lie to a police officer? That he's your sister Haseena's son! He'll ask us why we sheltered him for so many months! For months? - Yes, yes! For months! How is this possible? As if you don't know anything! Look I just know that I'm Chander Prakash! I live in Barahmulla. I love a girl named Chandni. I was going to get engaged to her. You came to your senses very late, dear. Very late! Khan Baba! I still say... - Stop it, Ashraf! This is not the time to lose your senses in anger. We will have to think calmly and solve this delicate problem. It needs time. Gul! Take him home! You all return too. We'll take the decision tomorrow. Heena dear! Why did I make this mistake, Noorie? Why did I dream about this? After all, the moon resides in the sky. Heena dwells on the ground. It was impossible for us to unite Noorie. Then why did I dream about this? Why, Noorie? Why? It is better that I shed all the tears here. I've made this mistake. Then why should somebody else be punished for this? Why should I hurt him by crying in front of him? No, Noorie! This is only my sorrow now. Nobody else should feel it. It's my entirely fault, Khan. If I had not suggested Heena's marriage to you, this wouldn't have happened. It's all God's will, Gul! What Heena was destined for, has happened. Who knew that our decision will ruin Heena's life? Heena, stop! Where are you going? I'm taking milk for Chander. No need for that! Give it to Zaman. He'll take it! Why Ashraf brother? Nobody has stopped me before! That was different, Heena. Now it's different! Ashraf! If the difference is that he is not Pakistani, he is an Indian he is not a Muslim, he is a Hindu he's not Chand but Chander, then its shameful! What are you saying, Khan Baba? Ashraf! If we call the moon shining in the sky, as something else, God won't diminish its brightness. So if a person's name is Chander and not Chand, then why should we behave differently towards him? Is he no longer a human? Is he no longer our guest? Guest? He has repaid our hospitality so well! Wow! That disloyal man played with our emotions! He betrayed us, Khan Baba! He ruined Heena's life! No! This isn't true, Ashraf! If he wanted he could've really ruined my life! Just think! How could anyone harm him? What if he had let the henna ceremony get over, married me and then disappeared at night? Heena! - Heena is right, Ashraf! If Chander wanted, he could've done this. But he didn't do this! Because he's a decent and a nice man. Fine! As you say! But now it's not right for him to stay here! Tell him to leave with his decency! Tell him to get lost from our life! This is not as easy as you think, Ashraf! He's a stranger. If somebody suspects him when he asks for directions, then he'll get trapped in the police's net! That will put all of us in danger! You know that very well! Then what do we do, Khan Baba! The way he had come here quietly, that's exactly how we'll have to send him back to his country. I've thought of a plan for that. What plan, Khan Baba? We'll leave this place today and depart for Sikandargul. If anybody asks, we'll say Heena's in-laws were insisting, that her marriage should take place in their village. On the route you and Razak will split along with Chander and, cross the border in the darkness of the night. By then we would have crossed Shahbaz Khan's territory. Nobody will come to know, that there was a guy named Chand living with us. You mean you want to dislocate the people of your tribe! You want to put them in even more danger! You want to endanger my and Razak's life! Ashraf! This is not what I meant! Forgive me, Khan Baba! Forgive me! I won't be a part of your plan! I won't! You can do whatever you want! Greetings! Ashraf! Don't take hasty decision! You don't worry, Khan Baba! Whether somebody comes with me or not, I'll surely take Chander across the border. You won't go alone, Razak! I too will come with you! God bless you! - Yes, Khan Baba! Well done my children! Chander, did you wash your face properly? Show me! Quickly have your milk! Here! I'm sorry. I've been scolding you for so many days. It has become a habit. I don't know about those days. But if you will scold me now, it'll be good. Chander! Yes! Scold me! Punish me! I'm the culprit! I'm your culprit! But just know that I didn't do this knowingly. It's like I was in an ignorant state. I was in a deep slumber. In your slumber I had a dream. So it's not your fault Chander. It's my fault, isn't it? Why should one cry over a dream? Dreams do get shattered. Life is not a dream. It's real! Chandni is your reality. She is waiting for you across the border. But now she won't have to wait for long. If god's willing, very soon you'll be with your Chand. Very soon! Can I come in? - You? It's an urgent matter! Tell me, Ashraf. What do you want to say? Before I say anything, you'll have to promise me something. Promise? What kind of a promise? That what I am going to tell you won't affect my tribe. Inspector, you will have to promise me, that you won't trouble Khan Baba, Heena or any one else from my tribe. Otherwise this secret will die with me. What rubbish? Whatever you want to say, say it quickly! - Keep quiet Nawabdeen! I promise you! Inspector, Heena's marriage has been cancelled. But why? That guy is an Indian. Khan Baba, I don't know how to thank you people. There's no need for that. Because whatever I did it was the call of humanity. Now go! Don't delay anymore. Goodbye! Bye, Heena. I'm leaving! Why bid Heena farewell? Heena will go with you. Heena! What are you saying? Why? You all got scared? Chander is going to return to his country and marry. Won't his bride apply henna on her hand? Here. Henna. Wedding gift for Chand on my behalf. "The cuckoo doesn't sing forever!" "The spring doesn't last forever" "The youth doesn't last forever!" "The companionship doesn't last forever!" "God knows which flower, He selects for whom!" "It's said God hears," "true prayers sooner!" "May God be with you!" "May God be with you!" "O traveller," "O traveller," "I surrender you to God!" "O traveller," "O traveller," "May God be with you!" "May God be with you!" "I pray that there is no hurdle in your path!" "May you reach your destination safe and sound!" "I pray that there is no hurdle in your path!" "May you reach your destination safe and sound!" "May your destination welcome you!" "O traveller," "O traveller," "May God be with you!" "O traveller," "This wholesome love, this pure relationship," "how do people here manage this?" "I'll never forget your love," "I'll not be able to repay your favour!" "You have given me a new life," "O generous people!" "O generous people!" "I don't feel like bidding you farewell," "O generous people!" "O generous people!" "You are close to my heart and away from my sight!" "I spend the lonely moments with your memories!" "You are close to my heart and away from my sight!" "I spend the lonely moments with your memories!" "My delicate heart has grieved a lot!" "O traveller," "May you always remain happy!" "This is my prayer!" "O traveller," "O traveller," "May God be with you!" "May God be with you!" "May God be with you!" "May God be with you!" "May God be with you!" "May God be with you!" Okay! Goodbye! - Bye, Zaman! Thank you! - Bye! Confess that you're actually a very cunning and dangerous spy. Why don't you believe me, I'm not a spy? You are a very dangerous spy. Khan Baba, Henna and all the gypsy people, are your companions and traitors. Nawabdeen! - Yes sir! Go and arrest that old man and his daughter and bring them here. No, they're innocent. Have mercy on them inspector. Don't expect any sympathy from me for people who betray their country. Inspector sir... - You haven't left yet? No, no you wait. Look inspector! I beg of you! They have already been hurt a lot because of me, please don't commit anymore atrocities on those good souls. You can punish me however you want, you can hang me, but please spare them. I'll do as you ask me to. Okay! Okay! - Yes! Then quickly sign on this document and accept your crimes. Accept my crimes? - That you are a spy. But I... - Will you sign or... Okay, I'll sign. Chander is in police custody! What terrible news have you brought brother Razak! But Razak how did that happen? Khan Baba, Shahbaz Khan knew our intentions. What, but how? Ashraf brother had informed them uncle. - Ashraf! Whatever Ashraf did, was absolutely right Khan Baba. The inspector kept his promise and released us, otherwise today all us would be rotting in jail. What do you mean? Brother Ashraf's suspicion was right Khan Baba. Chander turned out to be spy. No! - What are you saying? I won't believe it even if the whole world says so. I will never accept it! - Aunt, even we can't accept it. But we saw the document signed by Chander and the secret plans obtained from him. What? Lord, how can I accept it? Khan sir, how long? how long will you keep listening to you heart? Even lord has given the mind, a higher position than the heart then why don't you listen to your mind? Why don't you listen to your mind? You are right Ashraf. Baba, Chander is not a spy. There's definitely some misunderstanding. Surely there's some mistake. We have been in a very big misunderstanding. We could not see through him. Baba! - Yes dear, in return of our compassion he gave us such a wound, that I've lost faith in humanity now. Never talk about him again. No, wait father Chander is innocent. Aunt, you explain father you know Chander very well. Aunt! Why don't you listen to me? Why don't you believe me, Chander is innocent. Chander cannot be a spy! Chander is innocent! Why don't you listen to me? I know Chander is innocent. Allah, what should I do? What is this? - It is a watch. I don't the habit. - Then develop one, because you have to come to my house exactly at 5 o'clock. Why? - My parents want to meet you. What? Oh wow! Come on time, it'll be a big favour. Chandni, you are sitting here, and I've been looking for you all over the house. Come on dear, the groom's family is waiting for you. What about me, who's been waiting for ages? Greetings constable! - Why have you come here? I want to meet Chander. - Then why have you come here? How will I benefit Henna, if I let your meet Chander Prakash? Take it sir, it's silver. Go quickly or else sir will come here, go on. Thank you sir! Nawabdeen, you'll never reform. What are you doing here? You shouldn't have come here. Why? Are you afraid that you won't be able to lie to me? Lie, what lie? You told everyone that you're a spy, and everyone believed it too. But,I don't believe it. What about that? There's no reason not believe it. I have signed on the document. I have accepted that I'm a spy. Then take an oath on me and say it once again. No! You care so much for Henna. Why don't you think about the one who's waiting for you. I'm helpless Henna. If I wouldn't have accepted, then Shahbaz Khan would have destroyed your entire community.

I have attested the stamp on it dear. put it in the post box, it'll be sent by the evening mail. Thank you uncle, bye! Greetings sir! - Greetings inspector sir! Can you tell me, what the name and address was, on the letter which that girl just posted? Yes why not I'd written the address myself. The letter was addressed to Chandni Kaul and the address was of Srinagar. Srinagar! Look dear, if you have to live in this world then you have to think about the world too. Think about your younger sister Sudha. If you don't get married, how will she? And then Surender is not a stranger. We should be grateful to him. Even after knowing everything he has come to ask for your hand. Because he's Chander's friend. He can understand your pain. When the mother who gave birth to me cannot understand my pain, then how can others? Mr.Khanna, shall we have another cup of tea? No, Mr. Kaul. We're getting late. Listen, Chandni wants to say something. Yes, tell me! She wants to talk to Surender. May I sir? - Sure! Mr.Surender, you are Chander's friend, so you're my friend too, isn't it? - Yes, of course! Then I want to tell you something clearly. Yes please do! Mr.Surender, you want to marry me, because you want to see me happy. It's not just about you. Your parents, your sister everyone is sad because you are. All of them and even I want, that you live life again. After all that's the norm of life. You have to look at your present and your future, and try to forget your past. But Chander is not a past for me Mr. Surender. He's my present and my future too. I loved Chander, I still do, and will keep doing so till my last breath. Whether he returns, or doesn't. Now you tell me Mr. Surender, who will be the biggest betrayer? That I love someone and marry someone else. As far as my parents are concerned it'll be very selfish on my part that to rid my parents of their pain, I give it to you and your parents, That will make me even sadder. Do you want that? Not at all. This was not my intention. I know, that's why Mr. Surender I'm fine as I am. I have the memories of my Chander. His sorrows are enough to support me my entire life. Did you see my aim? So you have killed him?! No one can compete with me in sharp shooting dear. Yes, you have done a very brave deed. Let me apply turmeric and limestone maybe it survives. Escaping Shahbaz Khan is impossible. You're wrong inspector. The savoir is greater then the killer. Yes, I had read that in some book. But life is not a book. Otherwise you tried a lot to save that spy isn't it? Chander is not a spy, inspector. Yes you're absolutely right! We thrashed him so much, but he didn't accept it. But when I threatened him, that I would arrest you all for treachery against the country, only then he signed on the document to save you all, and gave me an evidence against himself. He turned out to be a sentimental fool. Yes inspector for you to be a fool and sentimental is same. Of course dear, now you'll see he will be given a death sentence and I'll be rewarded with a promotion. Chander's truth will be revealed in front of the world. Really, but who will bring his truth in front of the world? You or this letter written by Chander? Letter! In my area, nothing can happen without my permission. Did you understand Channa? If you really want to save Chander, then there's only one way out. Way out? Go and tell your father to come to me with your marriage proposal. What? Did you do all this for me? Your mere sight can mesmerise people. Listen to me carefully dear, Tomorrow Chander is going to be presented in the court, I will take only one week's time to produce the evidence. If we get married within the week. Then on the wedding night, as a gift I will give you all the evidences against him, and Chander will be saved. And if that doesn't happen dear, then believe me I'll see to it that Chander gets nothing less than a deat sentence. Think about it, Chander's life lies in your hands now. Bye! No daughter, I can't do that. - Father! No dear, you want me to hand you over to a wretched person to lead a wretched life. Have pity on me dear, I'm your father, and a father sends his daughter in a bridal gown, not a death shroud. You have Allah's swear, don't punish me like this. Okay father, if that's your decision, then hear my decision too. If you don't get me married to the inspector, then I swear I'll give up my life. Henna! - Brother Khan what are you doing? That means you don't care about your fathers feelings! Is that why I gave you so much love? So that one day you create problems for me! Stop it brother Khan, stop it. First ask her, why she decided to marry that inspector? Henna, you want to give such a big sacrifice for someone, who can never become yours. Why dear why? Aunt, Chander was never mine and can never be mine. I always called him by the name of that girl, who he always belonged too. It's a sin to snatch someone rights. Aunt, if love is the greatest emotion made by Allah, then uniting two lovers is truly a great merit. Well said dear, well said! I wish every person had a heart like Henna. No! No! Allah, I had asked for happiness for my child! I prayed to you, that always give her happiness and no sorrows! My Lord, if this is her fate then change it! Or else my Lord, I'll lose my faith in your forever. Father, you decided my fate, the very day you kept my name Henna. "Why should I punish this innocent to suffer?" "Why are you jealous of the happiness of your devotees?" "If by fate we ever meet, we will ask" "On what basis do you take decision of our life?" "I'm lively Henna!" "Lovely, lively Henna!" "Life is colourless without me!" "I'm lively Henna!" "Lovely, lively Henna!" "Both woman and henna share the same destiny!" "Both woman and henna share the same destiny!" "Both are used to bring colour in life!" "Both are used to bring colour in life!" "They both are happy by making others happy!" "I'm lively Henna!" "Lovely, lively Henna!" What happened aunt? Why are you all crying? You didn't do the right thing Ashraf, on the basis of a baseless suspicion, your pushed a man to the verge of death. Who are you talking about aunt? About that betrayer Chander? Yes, I'm talking about Chander, Ashraf, whom you handed over to the cruel Shahbaz Khan so that he can take advantage of this situation and trap us all with his cunningness. If the inspector wanted, he could have captured us, in the trap of the law. But he didn't do that, the release of Razak and Zaman is the evidence. That was just his plan, it was a deceit Ashraf! Shahbaz Khan has said so to Henna. Chander sacrificed himself to save us. He has paid the price for our loyalty. Do you want to know what Shahbaz Khan is asking for in return of his release? Even your soul will shiver with fear, if you hear it. You won't be able to tolerate it. Price? What price aunt? Ashraf, to save Chander's life, Henna will have to marry that cruel inspector. What? So Ashraf, you wanted to catch a spy, have you caught him? Did you see the result of your suspicion? Now your sister will have to suffer for your misdeeds. Her life will be ruined if she marries a cruel man like Shahbaz Khan. Her life will be ruined Ashraf. - No! This won't happen. Henna, sister! I'm a human, not an angel who cannot make a mistake. But you shouldn't be punished for my mistakes, I will not let that happen. I swear on you, that I will release Chander from the clutches of that cruel Shahbaz Khan, and take him across the border. Even if I have to sacrifice my life for it. Yes! Why have you stopped on the way? The wheel of the bullock cart has broken Shahbaz Khan. Khan Baba! Then move the cart to one side. We're getting late to go to the court. If you're getting so late, then send your men to help us. How can we lift such a heavy bullock cart? Nawabdeen! - Yes sir! Ask the soldiers to clear the road. - Yes sir. Come on, come! Quick! Come on! You wait here. What are you doing? - Is this any way! Move it. Remove the entire luggage. - Don't throw our things If anything breaks, who will compensate our loss? What kind of people are you? Say something! Shahbaz Khan, why don't you say something? I had asked you to help us and not ruin everything. Stop! - Move! Stop! - What are you doing? God will never forgive. - Stop! Oh Lord! God!. Nawabdeen! - Yes sir! You follow them from that side and I will follow them from here. Yes sir! Mustafa! - Yes! Arrest them! - Yes sir! Zaman here! Chander give me your jacket. There isn't much time give me your jacket. Henna, take Chander to the hill. We'll get rid of the police and reach there before night fall. Zaman this way, Razak this way. Come on! Ashraf, thank you! Come on Zaman! Come quickly! There they are! Stop Chander Prakash! Ashraf! - Brother! Ashraf! Sir! - Nawabdeen, Chander Prakash has escaped. Call the special force from the head quarters, and ask them to search the entire area. - Yes sir! Chander Prakash should not cross the border under any circumstances. Okay sir! Sir, they're going towards the trolley in sector 4. Hello Charlie! Hello Charlie! Message! Look Chander! Come on! Look Chander! Pull the trolley here with the rope. Help me! Come quickly! What are you doing? I'll go on that side and bring the car. No Chander! That's dangerous. There's no other way Henna. Carefully Chander! Careful! Careful! No! Chander! Henna! No! No! No! Chander! - Henna! Lord! No! Hold on! Come on! Fire! Hello Charlie! Message! They've crossed with the trolley and coming to the other side. Come on! Come on! Come on! Come! Come! What are you looking at? Jump! Carefully! Chander Prakash! We know that you're hiding here! All the exits have been sealed! Now you have only one way. Handover yourself to us! Chander Prakash! Sir, it is not advisable to speak loudly here. - Quiet! Is this the way you returned the favour of those gypsies. Because of you, Khan sir was arrested! Because of you, innocent Ashraf lost his life! Brother Ashraf! What happened to Ashraf will happen to Khan Baba and Henna too! It's better for you to hand over yourself to us! I promise you, that Khan sir and Henna will be released. You still have a chance Chandra Prakash! You still have a chance! Inspector! I'm coming! Chander, what are you doing? Wait! All the destruction that has happened because of me is enough Heena? No Henna, no more! - Chander, he'll shoot you. If by killing me he spares you and Khan sir then I accept this deal Henna. Chander don't believe him, he's a liar he's lying! Who knows, maybe he's speaking the truth this time. But I will take this chance to save you and Khan sir, Henna. Chander! Chander listen to me! Chander wait! Chander! Chander stop! Chander stop! Listen to me! - Move Henna! Stop there Chander Prakash! No Henna! Stop Jamaal Khan.! Careful Henna. Fool, who had asked you to shoot. I made a mistake sir. - You fool! Ask your men to clear the way quickly. - Yes sir. Where is Shahbaz Khan? - He just left? Those fugitives have been traced sir. What do you mean? Are there more people with that spy? There is a local gypsy girl, Henna. - Who Henna? Henna is my daughter, sir? You have come as an angel in our life. Please help her, her innocent life is in danger without any reason, sir. Without any reason? - Yes sir, she is innocent. Stop your nonsense. Sir please, don't listen to him. They all have conspired to release that spy. Old man, your daughter is helping a spy and you say she's innocent. Chander is not a spy sir, he's in dire straits. That's the problem and all this problem has been created by that cruel Shahbaz Khan only for his personal interest. You mean to say, that you agreed to marry Shahbaz Khan to save me.? That's why Khan sir and Ashraf helped me escape, so that you don't have to marry Shahbaz... Why are you quiet? Answer me Henna. Was my freedom so important, that you were ready to hand yourself over to that cruel man, so that he commits atrocities on you forever! You did all this for me! Why? Answer me Henna! It's not important to answer every question, Chander. You are under Allah's oath, please don't let Ashraf's death go waste, don't let father's prayers go in vain. It is Henna's fate to be crushed. But it's colour is still in your hands. Henna but... - Chander promise me! Promise me that you will go away from here and meet your Chandni. There's no other option. You will have to go. If that doesn't happen, I'll never forgive you Chander, never! Okay Henna. Come on! Chander! Chander look! Come! No Henna! There are soldiers outside. What shall we do now? We'll have to wait here till night fall. Ms. Chandni Kaul, Srinagar. Hello operator, give me the external ministry, Islamabad. Hello! Iqbal! Hi Iqbal, we have found out everything, about Chander Prakash from the Delhi embassy. It's true that he had met with an accident and he has been missing since that day. It clearly indicates that we cannot suspect him of being a spy. I see! Thank you very much. Bye! Mr. Khan seems like everything you said is true. All the debris has been removed sir If you wish you can go in. Sir, there's call for you from the police station. Sir! - Yes. There is call from Police Station for you. Yes Nawabdeen tell me what is it? Over. Sir there's terrible news. Superintendent sir has found out the truth. He has given strict warning, no one will fire at Chander and Henna. He wants them alive. - Hello! Over sir! - Hello! Hello! Nawabdeen, I cannot hear you at all. I didn't hear anything that you said. Did you understand? Over and out! It's so painful, the hands that should have been adorned with henna, today they were bleeding because of me. Chander! Only when one meets you, can he understand what Henna is? It finds peace in showering its happiness on others. You proved it Henna. You have proved that borders only divide the lands but it cannot divide the hearts. Chand will be very happy to meet you. I want to meet sister Chand myself! Until I don't adorn her hands with henna, my work won't be completed. Chander that... Come on! Come quickly Chander. Stop sir, the border starts from here, we are not allowed to go there. - Shut up! That scoundrel will not escape deceiving, Shahbaz Khan, come! Look Chander, there's the border. Come on! Fire... - No! No! Firing has started from the Pakistani post. Calling Charlie 4, 3 Alfa, firing has started here. Sir, firing has started at your post. Chander! Cease fire! Cease fire! - Cease fire! Chander, Ram Singh! - Yes! Go to the barracks and bring Chandni madam. Hurry up! - Yes sir! Stop Shahbaz Khan! Henna! What... Come on Henna! Hurry up! No! No Chander! I won't be able to walk. I'm in great pain. - No Henna! Henna, why did you do this? My time has come Chander. - No Henna! You cannot leave me mid way Henna... Not mid way Chander. You have reached your destination Chander... and... - Henna! I have reached my destination too. No, Henna! No! Chander, Chander give my love to sister Chand. Tell her, ask her to forgive me. Tell her, if Heena could have helped, then she would have never left without meeting her. No! Henna! No Henna! God is the greatest and the prophet is his messenger! "The God will take care of you!" "The prophet will protect you!" "The God will take care of you!" "The prophet will protect you!" Chander! All this? I didn't understand anything. Even I didn't understand what happened. Why did all this happen? Why were all these bullets shot... at this innocent girl? Why? Whom did these bullets belong to? Whose bullet was it that killed this innocent girl? Was it India's or Pakistan's? No, that was bullet fired in madness that pierced the heart of humanity. It was bullet fired in hatred, that killed love. It's a very shameful act. Very shameful! I ask you, why do humans make bullets? It can only kill someone. it cannot give life to anyone. Then why do humans make bullets? If it is possible that we can live peacefully on this earth, then why do humans choose pain, atrocities and war? Why? Stop it! Stop this game of separating hearts. This game of hatred, anger and jealously. Stop it.!Stop it! Stop it! It is Henna's fate to be crushed. At least its colour will still be there in your life. "You destroyed yourself but," "Still you did not get anything in return!" "You did not benefit," "from your sacrifice!" "You made our destiny," "but your destiny did not favour you!" "You are lively Henna!" "Lovely, lively Henna!" "Life is colourless without you!" "You are lively Henna!" "Lovely, lively Henna!" "Life is colourless without you!" "You are lively Henna!" "Lovely, lively Henna!" Subtitle synced by Anomix33
