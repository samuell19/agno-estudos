ALL CHARACTERS AND INCIDENTS PORTRAYED IN THIS FILM ARE FICITIOUS NO ANIMALS OR BIRDS WERE HARMED IN THE MAKING OF THIS FILM Dear, what do we call a 'Lucky person' in English? i We call him 'Unmarried'. i Dear, look at him. i I rejected him in my matchmaking once. i Since then he had become an alcoholic. i Lucky fellow, he is celebrating that bliss all these years. i What happened to your lips, how did you burn them? i That's nothing. i My wife went to her parent's home and I kissed the engine out of joy. i Don't forget to get some veggies while returning from the office. i By the way, Savita said hello to you. i Which Savita? i Nobody. i I wanted to make sure whether you read my messages or not. i Sir, my wife is missing. i Mister, this isn't a police station, it's MRO office. i Oh lord, this euphoria is making me go crazy. i Look at our neighbour, he always kisses his wife while he leaves for office. i Why can't you follow him? i How could I? I don't know her that well. i That means you have such intentions hidden in your heart? i Swami, tell me a few tips for a happy married life. i No.1, accept your mistakes when you are at fault. i No. 2, keep your mouth shut when you are not at fault. i Hail Swamiji!... i -What is the reason for your divorce? -Marriage only sir. i [man laughs] Dude, which one is better, love marriage or arrange marriage? i Your grandfather fought for freedom till his last breath. i Is it true granny? i Yes, it is. But I never gave that to him. i [man laughing] You're irritating me a lot, I'm unable to drive! i Arey what's your problem... hey look out! i [loud thud] I kept telling you... Oh no! Shit... shit... shit! Thank God! You just hit a flock of sheep. You never listen when I ask you not to drive! If you sit beside me and cackle up, it is for sure going to lead to accidents Do not argue with me. Oh God, I've hit a man. Oh shit. Brother, are you okay? Are you hurt? Shall I take you to the hospital? What's your name? MOST ELIGIBLE BACHELOR Eligible bachelor is fine, but what do you mean by most eligible bachelor? It means someone who makes a perfect groom. What are you doing here in wedding attire all alone by yourself? I'm not alone. I am in the herd. [lamb bleats] But what are you doing in the herd? [sighs deeply] You must know my story to know the reason! What's your story? Are you married? -It's been 12 years. -Then I won't tell you. Why? My story is dangerous for couples, it might cause a break-up between them. Really? You are underestimating us, brother! Our marriage is love-cum-arranged marriage. You can dare to tell it to us. 50% of a Man's life is a good career and the rest is happy married life. In order to have a happy married life, he needs to have a well settled career. My life is a straight line, home-office-home. He is Ganesh sir. My Office head. It is very important to save money in the US... So street food is our go-to menu. Health? We are still young to endure. These are my friends, all of them are married. The only entertainment for us is watching movie during weekends. It's a celebration for us if the movie is rated above 3.25 stars. Let's go fast, our folks would have come. Lap dance after movie watching is mandatory for our godfather. I have to be his security guard unwillingly. -Why get into this, Sir? -Hey, come on man. Oh no! -She is the daughter of our CEO. -Harsha! Her mother married a foreigner and she has inherited their lifestyle. -Actually! -My dad bought a flat in central park, I want you to have the flat keys but you are running away from me What shall I do with those keys? I like you a lot. Why are you scared of a live-in relationship? Give me a minute, I'll be back. -Okay, go. -Yeah, thank you! Fantastic! You can keep the flat keys for sometime. Sir, what are you talking? I can boast to my friends about living with your daughter in the same flat, But how can I even tell this to my family? It will be very embarrassing for me. Sir, relationship is not about spending a few days with a girl. It's about committing to a lifetime of togetherness with a girl. Stop! Give me a valid reason. Sir! My family has fixed my wedding. [in unison] What? What? Yes, it is on the 22nd of next month. Die! Get married and get lost. Sit... sit... fantastic! Congrats, Harsha! Mom, my new home. It's very nice. My son has bought a home for himself. Oh, so he is settling down? -The marriage is on 22nd. -Okay. Please book the wedding hall. Nice dad. -3.5, 4.5. Buy it... buy it. That's 5. -Why do you rate always? Hey wait. -Hi, Harsha. How is it? -It's good sister -in- law. There isn't must time for the wedding, and there are a lot of things to be done. There is a lot of shopping to do as well. Take brother's help. If I ask him to select sarees, he will look at everything but that. She is tasteless. She doesn't know anything, I'll select it. Ah! Harsha, look how beautiful this jewellery is. They are very beautiful. Ever since my marriage, has my husband ever bought me jewellery? I am using your wedding as a reason to buy myself some jewellery. Alright, fine. At least, you are buying now. Go ahead and enjoy. Bye! Take these. [music mutes speech] They are too tight. It's so cool. They are rated 4.5. Just buy them. -Is it? -Hell with your rating. Harsha! They are really cool. Keep using, it will be fine. Don't think too much. Okay, nice. -Hello! -Will you come to Harsha's wedding? I spoke to him. If everyone here asks about you, what should I tell them? You only ask me to earn well right?! Then...? You're brother in law is sceptical about his arrival... And one more thing... [mobile rings] Hello! Tell me dude. I sent a parcel to your address. Get it with you when you come here. What did you order? You are a kid and so, you wouldn't understand. Just get it. Hey... Hey... Is that a brush for your wife? -Nothing. -Gautham, your friend is blushing. -I already bought those. -Hey! Did you buy them all? i I bought it all what you said. -Come in! -Are you well? How are you? Is this your son? He's grown up now. Sister? Brother-in-law? How are you? -We are here. -We are doing well, brother. Harsha, this is your uncle. -Nephew, how are you? -Uncle! We got here for the wedding. Well, from now on, right from your wedding to your first night, I'll take care of every thing. Huh? -What kind of senseless babble is that? -I was talking about wedding arrangements. Oh! Is it? What's with you? Sit in my lap! Do you think this is a bedroom? Get out of here! Harsha, when buying your wedding furniture, pick a good quality bed. Buy it. All the wedding preparations are done. All set. I believe this is the last time that I am travelling alone. I will have my life partner with me from the next time. Wow! Oh, you're so blushing looking at your next seat. Learn from him! Wedding arrangements went well, so, how was your wedding ceremony? All the preparations? There is one thing left. What is it? Need to fix the bride, right? All the wedding preparations were done, but there wasn't a bride? Nothing like that. My parents had shortlisted 20 potential brides. I just had to select one from the short-listed brides. Is it possible? My family trusts me and I trust them. Yes, it's possible. I came here with that belief. Excuse me? Whose box is this? -That's mine, sir. -Come on here. -Sir! -Thank you. -That's not mine, sir. -Move. Whose box is this, please? That's mine, sir. Then, please open it. That's not mine, sir. One minute! Are you the one carrying this box? -Yes, I am. -Then, open it please. Okay Sir... what can you find in there? There aren't alcohol bottles either. You are still a kid, you won't get it. Just bring that. Sir, I am not even married. He isn't married yet and look what he bought. That's not mine!. Madam! I really didn't know about these in the box sir. And I believe you. Get out. Argh! He brought them all! Harsha! You... Idiot! [men laughing] He is here. -Looks like Harsha is here. -Is it! I will send the horoscope. May the evil eye of all kinds of people ward off. My dear! Come in. My dearest boy! -Harsha! -Hey, brother. Welcome to Hyderabad! Millet Uncle, how are you? Since I'm a millet eater I am fit like this, Look at your father... Grandma, how are you? Come... come... 'The apple of my eye.' -Apple? Take a bite and eat him up. -Shut up. We thought you would get married to a foreigner But you've left the decision to your parents. Brother, he's anticipating an adjustable bride, the final selection is always his. -You keep quiet! -That's true, sister. Hey, he knows everything. If you stop caressing him, he will go and freshen up. Harsha, I asked you to get a good sleep on the plane. -Yeah! I did. -Don't say that you are jet lagged. What did you cook? -I've made all of your favourite dishes? -Matchmaking starts from tomorrow... Everything needs to be settled in a week's time. Well, we can get it started right away. I am ready. Priest, this is my younger brother. This is Mr. Shastri's son. Right from matchmaking to wedding, he is going to take care of all the ceremonies. Even though all the wedding preparations have been made... you guys haven't fixed up the bride yet. Simply looking at all of you is enough to make me anxious. And you are the groom. How are you so relaxed? Since I already know what I want from the bride, what's the point in being tensed? You do have a lot of clarity on this! Congratulations, sir. This is the first wedding of my career. If this is a success, my life is going to soar. I need your support, sir. Please pat. [crow cawing] Have you come here too? How did you find my address? Get lost! Pat me once. Where is he? -What time is the matchmaking tomorrow? -10:42 AM. Sir, namaste! How are you, sir? Why aren't ready yet? My family is on the way. What do you mean they are coming? You told me that they would be coming in at 10:45 tomorrow morning. It's not tomorrow sir, it's today. No. no. Please check once again. I remember it. But, please check once again. Shit! We were supposed to go to Dharma Rao's house but landed in Dhananjay's house. What do we do now? They are here. Let's manage some how. Oh no! They are here. Father, we were supposed to come here tomorrow but came today. Here! -Namaste, sir. -Namaste. -Deal with it. -Leave it on me. Sir, today is also auspicious day. Ask them to get ready. Wear a shirt first. -Let's go. -Give me the remote. -I won't. -Would you or not? Geetha, dear! Groom's family is here. Take her in and get her ready. Okay. -Auntie! Auntie! One minute. -Come in! Come in and take a seat. Auntie, don't bother. If we get married, she is any ways going to be looking like this every day. You guys go ahead and talk! -Meanwhile, we'd get in here-- -That's the bathroom. [people laughing] Is there a good place to talk to each other? Please show my nephew a better place to talk, Or else he is going to talk to her anywhere he wishes. You are going overboard uncle! -Are you comfortable? -Yeah. I will get it for you. Okay. -My name is... -Geethika! You studied MBA. Your height is 5.5. And are born under Bharani Nakshatra. You want two or three? I want one... Only one? I want three. Your hobbies are YouTube, Instagram and Facebook. Your biodata is available on Facebook. Now, shall we find out if we are compatible? Yeah, sure. Question no. 1 Imagine that, after our wedding, my parents and your parents came to our house Who are you going to pay particular attention to? -Your parents. -What about your parents? Aren't you going to take care of them? I like Hrithik Roshan's movies. Oh! I am a huge fan of Ranbir Kapoor. What if both of their films release on the same day? Well, we will read some good reviews and go for the best one. Suppose you are busy and so am I, And our kid Chintu is crying for attention. Who is going to look after him? Our 'Chinni'' is going to look after him. Who is Chinni? Our daughter; we have two children, don't we? Are you going to work after we get married? Of course, not! What if I insist? This is enough, I won't get a more adjustable girl than her. What's something that both husband and wife must do every day? They must say I love you too each other. This is enough. Well, I was the one who kept asking you questions... Don't you want to ask me anything? Will you give me the remote when you are engrossed in watching the TV? Oh god! Remote? Obviously, no. We are going to have two TVs in the house, right? You watch what you want to and I'll watch what I want. I like how clear you are about things. Well, do you like Geethika? Father, Geethika is amazing. I like her a lot. What? -What happened? -Actually, We are going to discuss it over the week and give you a decision. Sure, we don't mind. We shall take our leave. The girl is good, right? You don't worry. You will surely get married. You have to meet another 20 brides yet. That's true. Don't be in a rush like me. What? Did you hear that mother-in-law? The next matchmaking ceremony is at 11:45 am at Padmarao Nagar. These horoscopes don't match well with yours. On your way there, drop these off at the country club. Okay? The name and phone number are on there. Take a look. Mom? The girl is really beautiful. Didn't we already tell you that you would certainly get married? Weren't you told that this girl's horoscope doesn't match yours? Put it in. Go and give it. Go! The girl is so hot! Shut up! [mobile ringing] Hello, Sir... -Hey, come on... -We are here sir. Sir! Sir! The other day, the box that you saw was not mine. They are his. Did you come here to tell me that? Your daughter's horoscope was given to me. Our horoscopes didn't match, sir. No worries If she marries him, his life will be ruined! Well, if your daughter marries me, her life would be ruined! Oh! should we say like this...? Sir! My brother wants to-- Apart from this horoscope, there was a photo inside. Yeah, we just discussed about her figure right? -What did he say? -The girl looks like a goddess. Oh goodness! Where is the photo? The photo must have fallen down somewhere along the way. -What are yiou saying, fella? -Fella! -Hey, you wait... -Did you see... These days, if you share a picture on WhatsApp, it's going to be shared amongst the relatives... and people who are ugly feel entitled to comment on my daughter's features. That is the reason why I sent a physical copy of the photo. And now you say it's fell down somewhere?! You can't even take care of a photo. Who is going to entrust their daughter to you? Did he ask for your daughter's hand? Why are you overreacting? -Who are you? -Who the hell are you? -He is my friend. -I don't like your friend. He is the Circle Inspector of Madhapur. Circle Inspector? A police officer! Sir, you must be discussing something personal! ...it's just a photo, sir. Why don't you let it go? I will not let it go. And I order you don't either. Where shall I get it from? I don't care. Go get it at any cost. Out! One minute. You go and get that photo back. He is going to stay here until then. Hey... What is this? Why am I pledged here like some gold at pawn shop? -Hey! -Sir! Sir... Why are you talking about toys? Sir, I just got it to look at them; not to use them. -Hello! -Where are you? Every one's waiting. I am on some important work, brother. I will call you later. What can be more important than meeting a bride? I am doing exactly that! What is he looking for? Hey, the photo... the photo... [mobile ringing] -Hello? -Is he there? They released me after telling me to bring the photo tomorrow. Just stay there. I am heading right there. -You found the photo? -I found it. One minute. Hello, sir! Come here dear. Come, let's sit. Don't keep staring. Come down! Hey! Oh no! Leave the photo... Hey... Please... You keep doing this, right? My buddy is on his way here, you'll get your lesson! [mobile ringing] Here, he's calling. Hello! -Is he around? -Of course! If I ask him to sit, If you hurry here, I will start teaching him a lesson. No, buddy. Let him to teach you lessons. Buddy? Hello? You hung up the phone! Oh my God! Now he's going to hang me. Have it, Sir. Don't do that, sir. Please stop that, sir. I am scared, sir. Please. [indistinct chatter] [mobile ringing] He's is messing with my life and you guys are happily playing volleyball? You... Why does he keep torturing us this way? -No. No, don't. -Hello? -Photo? You keep calling frequently and harassing about a photo. We've been searching the roads since this morning. And you keep calling my friend for the photo and torturing him. If you still keep insisting on that photo, where do we get it from?! Someone spoke the exact same nonsense and here he is. You have someone there, right? Keep him with you. We will give you that photo tomorrow morning. If we can't give you the photo, take Harsha and keep him with you. If you call again, that will cause a lot of trouble. Why are you shouting?! Why are you shouting? I am the one who is here. If you ask him to keep me with him, where is he going to keep me? Shut up! Here take it. Hello! I know where to keep you. -Where, sir? -Madhapur police station. There are many exotic toys there. Enjoy! You idiot! What's wrong with you? What is your problem? You just have to give him the photo and the issue is resolved, right? Where do I get the photo from? [people whistling] -Do you want to know about my size? -[crowd] Yes!... Hey! Looks like there are a thousand X-ray machines at once! May I know what this machine is? -Sai! -Girl friend? You have your girlfriend right beside you and you've been scanning me out! Until the show is over, be at it! I will tell you my size for sure. During my teenage, I had a friend. When she gets out of the bathroom, she would get all nervous and jump on the bed. When I asked her why, she told me that there was a ghost under her bed. I met her recently after she got married. When I asked her how she was. She told me that she is sleeping with that very same ghost on the bed! How many gho... I mean, married couples are there here? Singles? [audience shouting out loud] Okay, singles. Tell me what this line is. It's a yellow line. If I ask the married couples this question, They say it's the sacred thread. What did you say, uncle? Hanging rope! That is not our concept. Our concept is... On this side are the singles and they are on the right side. On this side are the married couples and they are on the. -Wrong side! -Left side yaar! But the topic isn't about left or right. It's about the centre. We are talking about those who are about to get married. These guys are in the confusion of whether to get married or not, And keep wondering what's going to happen if they marry or don't, Whom to get married to and how to select a life partner, etc. They look like LKG students who've been handed over an IAS question paper. At present, I am also from the same batch. So, singles... should I cross the line? Yes... Yes. -What about couples? -Don't... Don't. I got it. Singles view marriage like the moon; Admire its beauty and praise it in poetry. Whereas couples view marriage as landing on the moon, Wherever they look, it's all stones and dust, no gravity, no oxygen, suffocation. My God! Right? ISRO or NASA can help you get to the moon... But to get into a relationship... We have to create a conducive environment and generate the gravity. My Subbu does not understand this. He keeps asking me questions like, What kind of guy do you want? How tall should he be? What about his education? Do you prefer a wealthy man? .and keeps asking me over and over again. Then, do you know what I told him? My life partner is equivalent to my footwear. My size and the size that I want are the same. Size 8. This is me and this is my life partner. God, instead of putting these two together like in a show room... He made us like that scattered footwear we see in front of the temples. And I am left here all alone! Naughty fellow! Well, if I am in a hurry to cross the line and wore any footwear available. Though they would appear to be a pair of the same size, One leg would be doing a catwalk... While the other would be doing the moonwalk. When I discuss this footwear concept with my Subbu, He told me that he would beat me with his footwear... And ordered me to just marry the guy he chooses for me. Subbu is my father. Why would it matter to him? If something goes wrong in choosing a life partner... I would have to share my bed with a ghost. That's all for today, this is Vibha, signing off. Thank you. Harsha, why are we here? Go and ask her photograph. -Yeah, right! I forgot. -Go. -I don't know where I threw my shoe. -That was a wonderful show! -There is your shoe. -Here, your shoe. -Thank you. -The show was really good. Really? Thank you. You were really funny! I am in the same line as you are. Oh! You are going to be married soon? I am going to be married in twenty days. -Oh? Congrats. -Thanks. But, I got into a small problem because of you. -Because of me? -Because of your photo. You were one of the brides for me. Our horoscopes weren't a match. So, when I went to return the horoscope back to your father. Your photo was missing! That is where all hell broke out. 140 missed calls! [mobile ringing] And there it is, another one! -He is really on my case. -You've been caught in my Subbu's net, If you give me a photo of yours I will give it to your father... And cross the line, get married happily and head off to US. I did a show on crossing over to the side of being married for one hour. And here you are claiming that you will quickly get over to the other side. I am not so confused. I am pretty clear about what I want. Oh my Goodness! Darling, could you ask them to get me a cup of coffee? Sure! Brother! A black coffee. -If you give me your photo. -Just a photo, right? I'm going to ask you a question. If I like your answer, I'll give you my photo. -Alright, ask -Coffee. Thank you. Just two minutes. What do you expect from your married life? Expectations in married life? One should think about the nature of the girl that he will marry, But not the nature of the married life? You are gonna lead your married life after marriage, right? So tell me, what are you expecting from your married life? -A good wife. -A good wife? What do you mean? Friendly, understanding and someone who adjustable. No? What else could it be? Two families getting bonded for life and taking care of one another. No? What else then? Kids! Without kids, there is no happy married life. My grandma used to say. No? What else then? Last sip? Last chance? Just a minute. What would it be? Yes! I should have said this before... It has to be love. There is no married life without love. Am I right? You are going to give me your photo, right? What happened? I won't give you my photo. Go away. What else can be the answer? Think a little wild, darling? Wild? [music mutes speech] That is all. stories from Kakinada and memories from my engineering times. Well, conservations about Hyderabad and US must come from you. Have some coffee. What do you expect from your married life? I mean, what are you expecting from your married life? Caring husband. Secured married life. I need someone who can help me in household chores. I need domestic support. I hate joint families. I am expecting freedom. What else. -Of course, there is. -Yeah! Is it Love? Isn't it? What else do we expect in a married life? Isn't all these what people expect from a married life? Think a little wild... Darling! WILD? I don't think this girl is a good match for me. Harsha, come to Krishna Rao's house at 11:14 a.m. sharp. -Where is Sudheer? -Hey! He's gone to finish a small errand, he will be back soon. Okay, be on time. Don't be late. What's the hold up? Let's go. [mobile ringing] Oh God! The girl doesn't seem like she's going to give us her photo. And he wouldn't let Sudheer go. What do we do now? Hey, if the girl doesn't cooperate, you must impress the mother. -What? -I meant, for the photo. [door bell rings] Harsha, check that out. [knocks the door] I am here. So, you guys are stuck in Subbu's trap. Well, I must give you that photo. One minute. Yes! Got it! These are the photos that are in our house. These many photos? Why are you looking at me like that? Why do we need all these? Do you think my husband discusses all this with me? I don't know which photo of hers he circulated for prospective matches. -I will recognize it for sure. -Well, then. Let's see. This isn't your daughter. Well, that is me when I attained puberty. Oh, dear! We've been royally screwed. -Isn't it? -This is very pretty. This is her 1st doll, the one with a green dress on, that one. Those are the medals from her school days. That is her lunch box that she carried on the very first day of her school, She doesn't like to throw away any old things from her past; She would safely preserve all. All of the people of this family are very different. My husband is one of a kind and so is my daughter. And I am totally crazy. -Aunty! -Lokeshwari! What happened? -What happened? -I slipped and fell. Why is she running around like a mice? Son, please get some hot water. Where is the hot water? On the way. Hurry up, man. What are you doing here? Since you are not giving me a photo of yours, I came to ask your mother for it. What's with you? You've just created a fuss over nothing. Mother! My body isn't mine alone. Also belongs to my life partner. I must take good care, right? Is it over? What are you looking at? Actually... Photo. Photo, right? Let's go. Here. Take this and give it to Subbu. Find a nice girl, happily get married and live happily with your wife and children. May I ask you something? What? What do you expect from your married life? Eh? Idly, Vada, Sambar. Idly, Vada, Sambar? Yes. So, you are expecting Idly.Vada. Sambar from your married life? -Yes. -Why? What could be the reason? That's what I didn't know. I got it. Just sit here and stay. I'll be right back. Stay right here! I'll be right back. What did you understand? -Priest, we must make this match work. -What happened, dear? Nothing happened. Just keep conversing. I'm very sure that you are hesitating to eat. First, eat until you are full, we can have a chat later. Okay? Careful. Be careful while walking. Just chill, in my childhood, I have had worse accidents and injuries from these. It was back then, now are a grown-up! So? So, your body does not belong to you. Doesn't belong to me? Ya, it belongs to me. Yours? I mean, somebody like me. What are you talking about? I thought you were to be naive but you are trying to fool me? Try to understand me. -What to understand? -Get the inner meaning of it. Not inner meaning, there is double meaning in it. -Try to understand. cooperate with me. -Stop talking... I don't want to listen to you, get up, get up from here. -No... please listen to me. -What? What filth were you talking right now? Your parents seem so decent people, -I am leaving you only for that reason. -Didn't you feel it to be something new? It the worst. Dude, even this girl not a right match for me. Hey, darling! You came by your bike? Did you give my photo to Subbu or not? Well, how did your bride hunt go? What? You mean this as well? What's next? Another one? Ah! I must really appreciate your patience. God! Hey! Hey! I understood that I'm looking for Vibha in every bride I'm meeting. I'm unable confess this at home and clueless how to express this to her... Well, I have a doubt. -What? -How will you pick a girl? I mean, how would you know she is the one? Well, I am going to be meeting twenty brides. I am going to short-list the top ten. And then proceed with the first one. Oh! Alright. So, you're going to pick top-ten and then select the first one out of it? That's about it. List out your top ten favourite foods. I like Biryani. I like chicken noodles a lot. Mirchi Bajji. Chai-Samosa. -Mostly, I... -Tell me your top ten favourite places. First, Hyderabad. Second, San Francisco. The third, it's New York. Actually first... How will I be able to tell you if you put me on the spot? My top-ten places are Khajuraho, Kodaikanal, Araku, Venice, Kashmir, Lonavala, Goa, New York, Ooty. And, the top one is Paris. Do you watch movies? Oh yes, a lot. That's the only entertainment there. If the movie has 3 to 3.75 rating, you will watch it, Isn't it so? Most people there do that. Yeah, I thought so. Now, I believe it. You will surely select a woman out of them. How can you tell? You might not have an own opinion but you have a lot of people around you, Family, friends, relatives. All of them will give you their reviews. You will find a girl with the best rating. Don't worry. We've been on serious topics until now. On a lighter note, may I ask you a question? Question? You don't want me to. Alright, fine. Go ahead. Do you like Sunrise or sunset? I like sunrise. Why? When I get up early and get ready for work, I will be able to find the best seat on the train. I can happily travel, drinking a cup of hot coffee. I like sunsets. Why so? It gets dark only after sunset. For interesting conversation between a couple... One needs to have a dirty mind. Do you have a dirty mind? "Like a rose that pricks with its thorns" i "She touched the depths of my heart" i "Like a firecracker that lights up" i "She filled my eyes up with her light" i "Who are you? What did you do to me?" i "You are drawing me towards you" i "In a span of a single snap, you erased me from myself." i "When you come in front of me, I come to a halt" i "You hid everything that is right in front of me" i "Under the blanket of my eyelids, you've filled my eyes with a fistful of dreams." i "You make me lose my balance" i "You make me forget my sleep" i "You imprison me in a way that I cannot move at all." i "You even change the way that I take every day." i "I keep going in a direction that is unknown to me." i "Like a rose with a thorn" i "Like a firework with blinding light" i "Like the charm of a well woven courtyard" i "I've come to like you a lot." i "Like a rose with a thorn" i "Like a firework with blinding light" i "Like the charm of a well woven courtyard" i "I've come to like you a lot." i "Who are you? What did you do to me?" i "You are drawing me towards you" i "In a span of a single snap, you erased me from myself." i Hey. hey. stop it. Come to this side. Did you find the photo? Hey, wait. Don't stop him, sir. 200 missed calls. Will any sane person make that many calls to someone? If I find the photo, won't I just give it to you? Give that him. Sir, I felt very bad for what you said yesterday. I looked for the photo everywhere but couldn't find it, sir. "My breath keeps me alive, my thoughts keep spinning over" i "What are you doing in my thoughts, dear?" i "My lips keep speaking only after they take permission from me." i "But now, they keep calling out for you without my permission." i "What is this spell? i You never let me be alone." i "I have become something else." i "Like a rose with a thorn" i "Like a firework with blinding light" i "Like the charm of a well woven courtyard" i "I've come to like you a lot." i "Like a rose with a thorn" i "Like a firework with blinding light" i "Like the charm of a well woven courtyard" i "I've come to like you a lot." i "Who are you?"

If I like you, I will give you another minute. -What do you want me to say? -Say something interesting? If you marry me, your life will be prosperous. I work at Cognizant... -Our life's going to be smooth. -Stop that nonsense. Just tell me something interesting. Madam, you and I are not suitable for one another. We are not a right fit. That's all.

What's going on with you? You look at those brides without interest. And here you keep looking lost. Do you even know what you're doing? Do you want the girl or do you want to meet other brides? Decide on something. I want the girl. Let's stop the matchmakings! Alright, let's break this news to everyone at home. Okay, let's go. Well; they've already decided to meet up with twenty brides. If we break this news to them now, it might not go down well. Hey! Well, you select this girl and your parents will select another one for you. -That would be good for everyone, right? -No... No. You are right. That is why, even if you don't tell everyone, At least tell your mother. -Alright. -Let's go. Come on. Harsha, tell me how many people from US are going to attend your wedding? We need to book their accommodations. -That's alright. Where is mom? -They are coming here all the way from US. Jeez! Why would they come here from US? They are stingy buggers. They wouldn't come here. Forget about it! Mom? When did you guys come here? So, we are those useless people, huh? No... No. I didn't mean it. Stingy buggers, you said? -Come. Come up here. -I'm coming... Sir. I went to my own wedding just two days before... We came here to attend all the ceremonies from matchmakings, And wanted to surprise you. And that's what he has to say about us. -Please, sit down. Sir. -Sister-in-law, bring it fast. -Hi, Harsha! -Wow! This is good. That's a 5. -What about her? -1.5. -Hey! -Out of 2 darling. Sudheer bro, pass on these photos. What are you doing? Here, look at these photos. What are you doing? You said you didn't know how to broach the topic, right? Now, they'll start talking about it. Yeah, she's nice. Hey, really good man. Amongst all these brides, I wonder to whom my son is destined to? Destined to Harsha? Our CEO's daughter asked him, if he would like to be in a live-in relationship. You said something. What he replied her? What did you say? If my friends ask 'why did you like her'... I might brag about it to my friends. But if my family asks about the same I can't answer them. That is Harsha! That is Harsha! It isn't about who Harsha is destined to marry. It's the other way around; who is destined to marry Harsha, That's the point. That's Harsha. He is very wise, sir. He will never do anything wrong. We want to know who that bride who that lucky girl is! We are all excited to know who she is. What's next on the itinerary? Meeting another bride. Now you are the master of matchmakings, right? So, I'm sure you have a clear idea of what qualities you need from your future wife. Go ahead and ask me first. Never mind that. My questions can get uncomfortable. And you look very innocent. What do you mean? I hold the reputation of being able to answer the toughest of all questions. It's not about the questions. I am unsure if you would be able to answer my question? Of course, you will get the answer. Will you judge a book just by looking at its cover? That's true. Then, go ahead and ask me. Do you have a Di... [temple bell rings] Why talk about it? Please no. What was it? You asked me some 'Da' question? Did you ever go to Dehradun? Stop it! If you don't ask me your 'Da' question I swear on the mother goddess! Do you have a dirty mind? What kind of question you asked? Okay, let's simplify the question. Do you like sunrise or sunset? Su... -Su... -Don't stretch it. Rise or set? -Rise. -Why? Perhaps it's because of prayers, offerings and breakfast! -Isn't that so? -That's true. I expected this when I met you. I think this is not right match for me. What about you? What do you like? I like sunset. Why so? It's because it gets dark after sunset. Even this is not a right match for me. Sit down, son. The girl is really good. Even her family seems really good. If you agree to this match, I am sure you both will look good together. -What do you say? -Harsha! Something is wrong there. If we like the match, we would agree to it or politely refuse. How can you react this way? Is this how you show respect? That's what I've been telling. Such behaviour will not be tolerated here. Only sunrises here! There are no sunsets here! What does that mean? So, you mean to say we've all been living without sunsets at our village? How can you say that there is no sunset in Bhimavaram? Since I am at this side of the threshold, I'm simply conveying it in words. If I were on the other side, I don't know what measures I would take! Sir, just cross and come this side. -What are you saying? -Cross the threshold! -Let him cross. -Just a minute. Don't make my blood pressure shoot up! Sir, just a minute. Calm down! Excuse me! We are all educated people. -Sir, stop it. -Do we really need this violence? Can you not be a gentleman? -Hey, move away. -I mean... Why would they shove us? How could they man handle? My goodness, we beg you! We don't want this alliance. Even if you like this girl, we don't want this alliance. -That's true. Let's go. -Not that... Well, we need to know what's wrong. What can we do with that information? Sir... Sir. I am here to get to the bottom of that. I will find out their reason and get back to you. -He will take care of it. Let's go. -Sir! -Sir... Sir... One minute. -What? When everything was going well, why did you ruin it in that manner? If you told me what happened, I would've managed. Just agree to this match. Do you know what he asked my daughter? You said that you knew everything... You said you were very clear. Is this what you meant? Do you know what would happen when your family gets a wind of this? You told me that it was your first wedding and this would launch your career? You've already gone far along the process, Just once if you had allowed me just once, I would have fixed things. -But he wouldn't allow me to. -Uncle! Asking this priest to fix things is a useless venture. Sir, he's been fasting in order to make this alliance a success. And he has hypertension too. No, it's not hypertension. It's something else. -Something else. -True! He's right. We have our son's wedding, why irk ourselves with unnecessary thoughts? Let's focus on what needs to be done. That's true, Father. We have to meet Mr Rameshwara Rao's daughter now. They've asked their daughter to come down from US. He's already called us three times. They are waiting for us. Shall we go? Oh god! He stopped. Probably he will decide on something. Let's not go meet any more brides. Let's stop all that now. Enough with all this. -But they are waiting for us, father. -I told you. That's enough? He is going to get married at the auspicious time with the girl he liked. What does it mean? The girl he likes? When we began meeting the brides, he said that he liked the first one. -I liked the clarity in your thoughts. -Dad, the girl is awesome! But we didn't stop with that. We continued to drag him along to meet other brides. It's not too late any ways. Father, well... Sorry, son... you are right. -You are very wise -Father, I... What are you thinking about, son? It's a match that all of us have approved. That's right. Call them and inform them. The wedding will take place on the 22nd. We are going to get them engaged tomorrow. Okay, father. As you wish. Yes, tomorrow is the engagement. What? Is that Okay? All the best, sir. What? Did they fix your wedding with that remote girl? Why? What's wrong with her? You keep quiet What did you do then? My family wanted my wedding to happen. But, I wanted the same wedding with Vibha. But for that, you must first make her fall in love with you? I don't have that much time, brother. What did you do then? [door bell rings] I'd better hide. What are you doing here? I need to talk to you for two minutes uncle. -With me? -Yes. -What is it? -It's for you. Why did you come here? -Hey... -Yes. -Get me a glass. -Okay. Thank god! I was worried about your reaction. Aunty, just one glass. I don't drink. One glass was what I asked for too. Oh! Tell me. You told me that since I am incapable of taking care of a photograph... Who would entrust their daughter to me? I felt that in my gut. That is why I searched hard and found it. If you could take back this photograph and give your daughter's hand in my marriage, I will marry her and take really good care of her uncle. I didn't get it. You didn't? How did you decide on it just by looking at her photograph? To be honest, uncle. I couldn't tolerate your torture. So, I met your daughter. I liked her a lot. Did my daughter give you that photo? -No, uncle. -Well, then who gave you that photo? After that, I met Aunt. -Which Aunt? -Your wife. Oh no! I am very tensed. Get on! Get on! Aunty, I did not know that it was you and so held your hand! Shhh! Shhh! Don't tell my husband about my whereabouts. I beg you. His wife is fleeing in fear, but he went in to become their son-in-law! I wonder what's going to happen? Damn my fate! The bike's stopped. Does my daughter know about this? -No, uncle. -What about your family? No, uncle. They don't. They are good people, they will agree. -But you... -An idiot! No! No! You are the most important person. That is why I came to you first, uncle. Shouldn't me and my daughter like you? What flaws do I have that you wouldn't like me? You're holding on to what happened at the airport. You can ask my acquaintances, right from Bhimavaram to New York about my character. They would all proclaim that Harsha is the most eligible bachelor. You just need to say yes. I will bring my family within an hour. -[sighs] -Thanks, uncle. Where are you going? Don't you understand the difference between agreement and a deep sigh? -Sit down. -I don't have much time. I don't need it either. I'll tell you by the morning. -You can go. -Will you tell me by 10 AM? How about 9 o'clock? I know you'd give me an answer by 8 AM. Your silence hinted me a positive response. Thank you, uncle. Enjoy your drink. "The sound of it is in the air..." i "The sound of it is in the air..." i "The sound of it is in the air...

Are you not ready yet? It's time for engagement. Come fast... God! What do we do now dude? What happened? Why are you tensed? What happened? The bride's party didn't arrive yet. What? The bride's family didn't arrive yet? Not yet? Where is the priest? There he is. He's come. What happened? Sir, they said they are not coming. With just one hour left to the engagement, they refused to turn up? What happened? -Is Subramanyam in there? -Who are you? Tell him to come out. We need to speak to him. Hold on! They are shouting. What are you guys doing here? What is the issue? You made a mess of things and now you say we are starting a fight? Stop that. Do you know Mr. Dhananjay? Yes, I do. We are very closely acquainted with their family. So? So, didn't you say that the alliance he agreed is bad? Did you say that my son isn't a good man? Oh, dear! No, I didn't. I just said that the boy is a horrible fellow. And if his daughter gets married to him, her life will be utterly ruined. -What now? -What now, you ask? -Shall I show you what you deserve? -Shall we! We will. -This is exactly what -What are you doing, sir? Leave it sir. He took his phone out. You took the phone out? How dare you? -Are you at the police station? -Oh! Some idiots are creating a ruckus here. Come with your vehicle. -What? Are you going to hit me?! -Yes, I am going to hit him. -Father, what's all this trouble? -Stop him sir. You are not to involve in this. Go inside. Listen, dear. My son's and your horoscope were not a good match. So, we decided to let go of this alliance. Your father bore a grudge against us and ruined his engagement today. Harsha is supposed to be married in ten days and return to US. How dare you bad mouth such a gem, son of mine? A gem? Are you aware of what your son did? Last night, he came to our house and asked me for my daughter's hand. What do you mean my son came to your house? Why would he ask for your daughter's hand? He came, sir! He came with a whisky bottle. Father, I know Harsha. If there was something like this, he would have talked directly to me. -Why would he ask you? -Foolish girl... You... Do you see that? 140 calls. Hey! Rowdy fellow. Do you see? How many sir? 140 calls! Isn't this your son's number sir? He is waiting for my decision, sir. Shall we go to police station sir? What's happening Harsha?! He is talking rubbish about you... Father, I'll tell you what happened. Sir, what is this? I will explain... Mr. Dhananjay Rao! Did you guys agree to this match upon discussion? Or is it because he liked your daughter? On the day, he proclaimed that he likes my daughter in front of everyone. -Isn't it? -Yes. And now, he comes to my house and tells me that he likes my daughter too... And said he wants to marry her. What should I do to him? Just for one word, the whole family is pouncing on me like a drift of pigs. -Hey! What are you talking? -Harsha! How dare you? What do you know about my family? You sing praises for your family and your family sings praises for you... Am I an...? - An Idiot! You asked this question earlier; I'm answering it now. You are an Idiot. You are so done! You are finished! [laughs] This is just a petty case... You don't worry. I am there for you... Please come with me. Your honor! If their son is really such an upstanding character, It is indeed a point of pride. But all the accusations laid against the young man are true. My client claims that the young man's character is the worst. If you permit me, I'll present you the witnesses. Let's see who has to apologise. Let the court decide it. Your Honor! Listen Meenakshi, You met that young man during your matchmaking. What did he ask you? He asked me, 'What do you expect from your married life?' Isn't this a common question asked when a bride and a groom meet? What's the problem with the question? The problem is not the question, Mr. Janardhan. It's with the answer that he expected from her. Tell me... what do you expect from your married life? Don't look downwards... look at my face and answer. Peace... Mr Venkata Ramana. Peace! Did you find it? -I am searching. -Still searching? Madam... What do you expect from your married life? Take good care of me. -I want Support sir. -Peace Sir. Respect, Sir. Sir, have you heard? He dismissed all of her answers. Since he is from this generation, must have expected something like love. He dismissed that as well, sir. Not even love? What else is there besides that? I asked him the very same thing, He told me to think of a 'wild' answer sir. What did you say? Sir, I told her to think of a wild answer. -No, sir. -Then what? He came up this close to my face and told me... -Think of a 'wild' answer, darling! -My goodness! I object your honour. He is asking my client to have a strong thought, a deep thought, well-sorted thought, would she implant a zoom lens into her brain? You need not implant a zoom lens. Please go, have your seat. Please, go. Miss, did he ask you the very same question? He answered that question. What did he say? He said, 'Idli, Vada, Sambar' sir. Idli, Vada, Sambar? What's that? He must have been hungry and asked for those. -Yes sir. -No, sir. That's what I assumed as well. But, I got to know later what he meant by his hunger. -What's your hunger? -Sir... Sir... Look at him, How he was giving me signals. What he has done? According to him, my body isn't mine. Oh my! -Well, whose is it? -Apparently, his it seems! Sir, have you heard that? According to him, her body isn't her. Apparently, it's his it seems. How disgusting? Madam, you can go. You go... We will teach him a lesson. Hello? -Madam... -My body is mine. Understood? Everything is yours, miss. Right from the bottom to the top. You can leave. What did you ask her? Sir, actually the meaning is... Exactly, just to crack that meaning... Your honour, I request you give the permission to present a new witness. Sir, do you like sunrise or sunset? I like sunrise, dear. I can have a cup of freshly brewed coffee... And start the day with the newspaper. Isn't that right? Apparently, he likes sunsets. Why is that? It's because only after sunset, it gets dark. You said, some smoke and fire...? This is the fire... The fire behind the smoke. He didn't stop at that, sir. He said, it's important to have a 'dirty mind' in order to get married. And, he said that at the temple. Ridiculous! Right in the sanctity of the temple? How could he speak such perverted thoughts? Looks like he's stuck too deep! If you want a decision on this case, I need some time. The court is adjourned for the day. You've created such a mess and are now deep in thoughts. What's that girl thinking about me? You are still thinking about that girl? -Look at your father's plight. -Please forgive me. Damn! We are the ones in the wrong. It doesn't matter if he don't get married now. His future will be ruined. Please take back the case. Okay, I will take back the case. But on one condition. Your son must leave India within the next 24 hours. Okay? [crow cawing] Here you arrive? You've always said that I dealt with funerals... And I'm not suitable for performing marriages. And yet, I didn't listen to you. I finally got it now! Let's go and do what we do the best. Coming! I cannot even utter what you've asked to those brides. Why would you ask something like that? Are you trying to get married or trying to get laid? Uncle! We've looked and selected a girl who could be his wife with qualities such as beauty, Good-natured, good wealth... If their horoscopes matched and whether she hails from a good family. Well, then, what kind of a wife are you looking for?! On one hand, we are preparing for your engagement... And you asked for that girl's hand for marriage? What did you like in that girl? The questions that he asked in the matchmakings belong to her. He just got confused because of her. Because of his daughter's mistake, should we all suffer? Let's go and confront him. What's the point in blaming them? The fault is his. So, shall we leave them unscathed? Hey, if you have something to say, come inside the room and say. If the girl has instigated him, what happened to his senses? You bragged around that your son is very wise. Now, look at the state that he's dragged us into. Father,actually, Listen up! Tell him to get packed and leave. Stop... Stop... What happened? I just want to meet that girl and come back. -Hey! -Have you gone mad? Don't be confused. Get on the flight and leave. Everything will calm down. She asked me what I expected out of my married life. She doesn't know that I expect her in my married life... And neither do I know what she expects? I must know her answer before I leave. Buddy! Listen to me! I must know the answer before I leave! Hey... Hey... Do you know who is a blind man? Not someone's who's lost their vision. It's someone who doesn't have their own opinion. I hope you guys get what I meant. So, if someone doesn't have an opinion of their own, Idli,Vada,Sambar! [crowd in unison] That's correct. Idli,Vada,Sambar! That's all for tonight. This is Vibha, signing off. Thank you... Thank you. Hey, darling! What brings you by? Come. I thought you must be on your flight, how come you are here? Don't you know why? What? I ignored all my matches and came to your house and asked for your hand. My family is saying that I'm not doing the right thing, My friends say I'm confused. Only your opinion matters to me. There is nothing new to say... I didn't reject you now... I rejected you even before you came to India. He has a job in the US. He is from a good family. He has everything. Apparently, he got leave for 20 days. He is coming down to get married. You just need to say yes, and everything will be done. What do you say? I don't want him at all. You took leave of 20 days, Decided on the date of the wedding, and came here to search for a bride. That's when I already understood. I figured that you don't know anything about marriage, And you don't know what to expect in the girl who's going to be your wife. You don't even know yourself either. I don't? You tell me that I don't know a thing? Before wanting to get married, I secured a job in US. I bought a house for myself. I ensured I have everything necessary to keep my wife comfortable. I got ready for marriage only after I became the most eligible bachelor. It isn't enough to be eligible only for marriage. You need to be eligible even for a married life. Eligibilities for married life? This is unheard of! Eligibility means whether he can take care of you and stay beside you all his life. Anyone. I don't want someone to stay beside me all my life. I want someone who is closer to me. What's the difference between being beside you and being closer to you? See, you are asking me again. See, I expect an adjustable nature from my future wife. Because I can adjust. Oh, my goodness! Yeah, exactly my goodness! I won't adjust, and I don't want anyone to adjust for me. You asked me, "What do I expect from my married life?" If you want. I can answer now. Yeah right! I know. It's Idly, Vada, Sambar!... Devour me! No! I expect... Great romance in my married life. -Hey... -Thanks. Hello, give it here. I understood one thing. Your thoughts are far away from the reality of life... Your philosophies won't work out for marriage, They are good for an affair. Listen to me now. I am expecting a good wife! A nice family! Kids! And above all that, Love! That's all. Anyone would expect the same thing out of a married life. Given how qualified I am, I am sure to find a girl of my requirements. I will get married and I'll be happy in life too. But, you will just end up crazy. This is my opinion! My very own opinion! Bye... I was unnecessarily confused. Darling! You've gotten pretty worked up. On a lighter note, may I ask you a question? Do you like sunrise or sunset? I like only sunrises. I am a morning person. Did you get that? I love sunsets. Do you know why? Damn! Didn't I buy all these things so that my married life would sail smoothly? If these things don't give me a good married life, what will? -Shankar? -It's 'Shoulder Shankar' dude! Tell me. I was thinking of selling the house. Could you please search for a buyer? What kind of a difficulty are you in? i -I just want to sell it. That's all. -Listen to me. i Please. Hey, Harsha! Just cry. Cry your heart out. -I just asked you to look for a buyer. -Just shut up! Don't you think I know what you need? Would someone sell their house for such a small issue? I will make sure you begin to desire to live your entire life in this house. Come, let's go in and cry. -What? What for? -Let's go. Let's go in and cry. Smile dear... Wide smile... Dear, be positive... Please listen to me. An empty stomach is a cause of all problems. Tell me what you want to eat and I'll serve it for you. As you wish. No, you must have thought of something. Tell me what you want. Alright! Make some chicken Biryani. I'll have it. Let's not have Biryani now. It would be difficult to sleep at night. I'll make you some Maggie. Just 2 minutes. -Sudha! -Hey... Hey... -Harsha! -Damn it! Harsha! You need a hug, man. You need a warm hug. Come man, I'm topless. You'll feel better. Come na! Harsha! I didn't bring my brush. [screams] Shankar, tell me. i Are you guys human? Are you eating edible things or eat something else? When he was happy, you were all cheering and got along well. While he is in suffering... You say that his suffering is personal. Are you going to leave him alone? He is in pain. Ask about his problem... Consoling him and providing a solution to his problem. You don't have the basic sense? Disgusting! You guys won't come until I call you up and curse you? Harsha! Just tell us what's your problem? Is it because that marriage is halted? Or is it because the girl rejected you? It's not because that girl rejected me, I rejected myself. -What is talking? -Please don't say that. The questions I asked at the bridal glances were not mine. But the answers were certainly mine! And... If I don't like those answers, that can only mean that I don't like myself. Don't confuse yourself with unnecessary thoughts. What does marriage mean? It means eligibility. Are you eligible to get married or not? Definitely, you have. 100% you are the most eligible bachelor! Next year we shall get you married to a very pretty girl... -You can live happily. -Super sir! What is marriage? It's very simple. Did we provide them with what they need? And do they provide us with what we need? That's about it. For instance. You have so many successful couples around you. Trust us... Don't be confused unnecessarily! Hey, Ganesh! Sorry, Ganesh Sir! Don't know if he understood or not, but I did. The meeting is over. Finish your drinks, have maggie and... Disperse! Out of my sight. [man laughing] Why is he forcing me to laugh? He is just like that, brother-in-law. [mobile ringing] -Hello? -How's my brother doing? -How else can he be? He is fine. -Alright bye. i Hello! Hello! Satya... She doesn't even bother to ask about me. They started looking for brides again for you. Why are they in such a hurry to get you married? Why don't they let you enjoy your life? Alright! Bro-in-law. Ganesh Sir's 25th anniversary is taking place at his home... You too come. I am sick of these wedding ceremonies and parties! What's the fun there? Alright, fine. Go and get ready. [unclear audio] Come on gentlemen, let's go party. What happened? Nothing, I am OK. I am alright! For another 25 years of marriage... What happened? I'll be there in 2 minutes. I am coming. What I mean is... Such little things do happen. Why can't you just let them go? Yeah right! I let it go. Ever since marriage... I've always been told this by my parents, his parents and relatives. And now, an unmarried person is also giving me the same advice. Is there something new? What exactly happened? -Darling! -I am here. What? You aren't ready yet? -Coming. -The guests are beginning to come. Do you know what I got for you? 50 lakhs worth 2 carat fine cut diamond ring. Happy anniversary! I am gonna booze like anything to night. Don't restrict me. I gave what you wanted. That's it, job done! A Diamond ring he says? He doesn't even know what I want. I will adjust and let it go. 362 days in a year I am doing the same thing. You have no idea about my pain. Why am I even telling you all this? I can't feel my husband's love in that ring. I generally feel his love... On occasions such as my birthday, his birthday and our wedding anniversary. And now even that is missing in my life. Darling! -Where are you? -Yeah, I am coming. I won't adjust with anyone... And I don't want anyone to adjust for me. I hope you are not sad that you are leaving. You are coming to London soon, right? We are going to max out the fun limit. Okay. What is it? I thought you must have had a good time at the party. But you seem a little off. What happened? What do you mean by married life? Why did you ask me about such a big question? Did I not give you what you want and need, darling? -Nothing like that. -No. I need to do something special for you. Maggie Masala with Spring onions. Then, your mood is gonna be high in the sky. Yeah! [laughing] If I knew the answer to that, why would I go through this? I don't know how badly you were affected when the wedding broke down. But I felt really bad about it. Your sister and I are not getting along with each other. After your wedding... We wanted to tell everyone that we were not going to continue with the marriage. What happened? Why doesn't she get the simple fact that I am working myself to the bone for them? She wants a luxurious life, and she wants me beside her. How is that possible? When I told this to your brother... He said that he was going through difficulties in the marriage himself. He also said that, even though your parents look happy on the outside, But they frequently are at odds with each other. Hey, if you have something to say, come inside the room and say. What is it with you? Go ahead and sit in my lap. Do you think this is a bedroom? Get out of here. I don't understand this married life and all this bickering! Sit down. Basically, no one knows what married life means. You must simply compromise on things. If you get along, then, that's fine. If not, the marriage breaks down. But, the question you asked me is quiet correct. We earn crores of rupees. We simply don't know what they actually want. If you know the answer to the question, please tell me. It isn't enough to be eligible only for marriage. You need to be eligible even for a married life. Do you think there are eligibilities for married life too? What are you doing? The story he told us, at least had three romantic days in an entire year... But, in our story, there aren't even a couple of days in an entire year! What do you mean? You forgot my birthday last year, didn't you? Oh goodness! Please don't go there. Brother, I feel that listening to the story beyond this isn't ideal for us. Tell me where you want to go. I'll drop you there. No... Continue with the story. I was convinced that there is some truth to Vibha's perspective. And I felt that she was right about me. I don't know what marriage means. And I don't know what to expect from the girl I am going to marry. And finally, I don't even know much about myself. I felt that I shouldn't be with herd any more. I should know, who am I. I've decided to become an answer for all the questions of Vibha. We spend 9000 nights with our life partner. And we might eat 25,000 meals together. We must go for hundreds of vacations together. And more than that, we need to talk about a millions of things. "Oh dear, no one has ever warned you" i "A little heart was floating about in the wind. " i "Never mind. At least now, for the first time, it has come to know. " i "At least now, ground yourself and learn to walk anew. " i "All these days, the world hailed you and lauded you. " i "This foolish fellow did not ever know the weight of his own self. " i "All this while little heart was floating about in the wind " i "At least now, hit the ground and start learning to walk anew. " i As soon as my parents decided to get me married... My mother told me that she is going to teach me how to cook. I asked her if she would teach me how to serve. "You were just a piece of rock before. Now, you"ve been turned into a sculpture" i "With the sharpness of that smile" i "The girl of your dreams is right in front of your eyes" i "Looking like a flash of lightening in those lamps" i "When you look in the mirror, does your image look exactly like her?" i "Does this twist in the tale make you feel at home?" i "All this while little heart was floating about in the wind" i "At least now, ground yourself and learn to walk anew" i -"Oh dear, no one has ever warned you" i -You don't even know about you... "A little heart was floating about in the wind" i "Never mind. At least now, for the first time, it has come to know" i "At least now, ground yourself and learn to walk anew" i "All these days, the world hailed you and lauded you" i "This foolish fellow did not ever know the weight of his own self" i Tell me top ten foods you like the most. "All this while little heart was floating about in the wind" i "At least now, hit the ground and start learning to walk anew" i "All this while little heart was floating about in the wind" i "At least now, hit the ground and start learning to walk anew." i Our companies tie up with the Future company is very very important. What the hell are you going to do about it? -Tell me. -What's going on? That Future company's team... Was not impressed by us and so, withdrew from the tie up. -There's no tie up now? -No. Do you know how important it is for us to tie up with them? Do you guys understand? -What are you guys doing? -Where are they? They just went to the cafeteria. -Please listen to me... -I need answers! Impressed. What impressed? You decided quite quickly that the tie up with our company was not worth it. I am impressed. We wanted to do business. We saw the profit and loss your company makes... And we understood what your company's dimensions are and it's worth. It's simple. Coffee? I don't like the word coffee itself. Okay. Well then, another coffee? -For whom? -For you. I specifically told you, didn't I? Perhaps you could try it. Hey... Shall we play a game? Is Harsha really this confident with her? You're using the dimensions properly. But there is another dimension to note. Depth! You just saw our company's profit and loss statement. But you didn't see the commitment and hard work of the staff. We can change the balance sheet. That is our company's X factor. We want to do good business. Coffee isn't just a word. It's a taste! Impressed! Our company's tie up with Future company is... Is done! Yay! Congratulations! -Congratulations! -Congratulations, Harsha! Where's the treat? [mobile ringing] -We need a party man. -I am just getting a call. -Hey! -I'll answer it and get back. -Yes! -Hello? Did you meet a girl called Chinnu in US? Yes... How do you know that? That's regarding the company. Apparently, you had coffee with her as well? Had a coffee with her? I made her have coffee. Her family came to our house to have coffee with us. It would be good if things happen on time. Really? Don't kid around. I am not joking, Harsha. They came to discuss your marriage alliance. Marriage alliance? What do you mean a marriage alliance? Hey! Dad... I didn't agree to the match that you wanted. I agreed to the match that came seeking us. Dad... You just need to be here two days before your wedding. Alright! Is what I heard true? You met the girl just once and got her to agree to a marriage with you. Super, brother! Congratulations. You can stop with your jokes and listen to him. Well, tell me brother. I felt that no one else other than Vibha knew how to live with a life partner. I wanted to do everything possible to make Vibha my life partner. Well, setting aside the fact that you are okay with it. Your parents should also agree to it, right? Even before that I need to convince Vibha. I told my folks that I would come two days before the wedding. When in fact, I left 10 days earlier to meet Vibha. Hey! If there is something, please confess it to your parents. What do I tell them? If I didn't want this marriage, I would tell them immediately. I need to tell them what exactly I want. Then, what about that girl? I need to tell her that I am not the right person for her. The answer to everything is Vibha. Hey... Hi, aunty Who is it? Try and guess. I'm not able to. It's you? I want to meet Vibha aunty. She is not here. When will she return? She won't come. She left home. What happened, aunty? Do you know why my husband withdrew the case he filed against you? -Come let's go. -Dad. Enough with all this mess. Withdraw the case against him. Withdraw? Why? All those words he spoke came from me. -Leave it. -It broke out between them, since then. If a guy speaks such words, they look at him all weird. Now, if a girl speaks such words, they are going to spit on you. When we ask you... what do you expect from your married life? You are going to spew all sorts of nonsense, huh? What is it that you want? You guys have been married for 25 years. Then, you tell me, what should be expected? I thought I would get you married to a good guy. But, no. I just need to get you married immediately. So, are you going to order my match for me on Swiggy or what? He kept getting her grooms for her and she kept rejecting them. And she kept cracking jokes on him. You should have seen how agitated he was. Finally, Vibha really did select a guy. And I was so relieved that my daughter was going to get married. But I don't know what happened. Suddenly she decided that he wasn't the right guy for her. What would it lead to! He started demanding what is it that she wanted to prove to him. She stopped joking. She couldn't take her father's pressure on her. She decided that she didn't want to get married at all... And left the house. Here... I don't know why you are back. But my daughter is in no position to tolerate any pain another time. Right now, I can't tell you how happy I can make Vibha. But I am certain that I will never make her sad. Your daughter will return home. [music mute's speech] Bro, why did she hit you? I told her that her father had arranged this matchmaking. Since I cannot hit my father. That is why. I told her that instead of giving me a minute, she could meet me ten times. Do you know why I left my home? You know that she is hitting, right? Why are you asking her questions? Why did she hit you so hard? I told her, it's fine she hit me but I wanted to know when she would meet again. I said that I don't want to get married ever. Don't you get that?! She is crazy, brother. This time, it is certain that we will be arrested. Be prepared. Let's meet to have a lovely chat...? Who wrote that? Check it. It must be a fan. When I see him, I will teach him a lesson. Was this your plan? Do you really think you have enough time to woo her? I thought it would be enough to show her that I've changed. If I need to change her mind, then I really need to woo her, right? She is slapping the guys who meet her. How are you going to woo her then? I am going to do that without showing myself. That mean its cool? I am in no way related to this plan. I thought that he will get married, but looks he's going to beyond that. -Stop... Stop... Lola bike? -It's my bike. Oh, it's your bike? Please be on your way. What is this? -Does she plan to come out or not? -Hey! Relax dude. -Are you the 'Lola' bike? -Yes. Go on then. I've waiting from morning. Why are you so late? Sir, you just booked the ride. Please tell me the OTP. -Wait here. -What? -Good morning ma'am. -Good morning! Sir, OTP. Ask me a little louder. -Sir, OTP? -4.3.5.7. [message tune] Hmmm. It's here. What? -Vibha? -Yes. -Is it Vibha? -Yes. Why are you looking at me like that? -Sounded like a girl's name. -Yes it is. Huh? Please be comfortable, madam. I am going to safely drive you without any glitches and hassles. I am a five-star rated driver. What do you mean? The App says you are rated 2.5 stars. -Vibha ma'am... -Yes. Where are we going? I haven't really made up my mind. Keep driving. Hey! -Sir! Sir! Sir! -Hey! -What happened? -Just wait sir. Is this what you mean by a 5-star rated driving? It's a puppy ma'am. Just for the rating, would I take it's life? -Sir! Sir! They are leaving, let's go. -Hey! You. Keep driving. Just because of the sudden break, you would give me a mere 2.5-star. I saved the dog, didn't I? I am going to give myself 5 stars. What do you do, madam? Stand up comedy. They say you must live a life of laughter. And you, make a living by making people laugh. That's a good job. I want to do that, but people keep saying that it's a risk. The biggest risk in life is not taking a risk. How is your life? What can I say, madam? It's like a water drop on a lotus leaf... I don't know where it's going, and I don't know how to stop it either. Stop further ahead. -Hey! Stop! Stop! -Vibha! What are you doing? Can you wait for fifteen minutes? What happened, buddy? She wants me to wait for fifteen minutes. Wait for fifteen minutes. Mr. Vibha, that is going to cost you extra. Okay. -Mr. Vibha. What are you doing? -I am waiting. -Hi... -Hello. You said that you would give me a slot for a stand-up show. So, can I plan for this weekend? I cannot give you a slot for this weekend. Well, why don't you give me a slot for this Wednesday? You can tell me after you watch the show. Sorry, madam. Since it's business, I cannot take the risk. Hope you understand. Not taking a risk is the biggest risk in life. Shall we go? Here, hold this. Is your work done, madam? I told them the exact same thing that you said. And it worked out. Looking at you, I feel that you are not an Lola bike rider? Who told you that I am an Lola bike rider? I've been trying the whole day to flirt with you. If you want, take a look. Haha. Good joke! Are you married? No. Please get married. Instead of riding an Lola bike, your husband will drop you happily. No. Will the your family agree with your decision? I told them. You told them? You are really brave. Well, how did you break the news to your parents? Why is that your concern? Please tell me, madam. I might find your experience useful in a similar situation. Don't take me as an example. Just do what you feel like. That is what I am doing. Thank you! What are you doing here? First, let's go home. It's difficult to find matches even for a girl who is at home now a days. And now, you got out of the house, do you know how difficult it is to find a groom? Of course, you wouldn't know. And you are a weird one. Hello, boss! What are you listening to? Is this your entertainment? -Get away from here! -You don't leave, dear. Please come home. Please come home and crack as many as jokes you want. I've no mood for jokes now. Hey! Hello? Hello? Look... Please drop me at home. -My house is... -I know... How do you know that? Ah! Well, you might know. It's possible. My daughter keeps riding around on your bikes. Thanks for coming, had fun chatting with you! Why isn't he picking up my call? [mobile ringing] Stop here. Take it. -Hello... -Is the man who dropped you still there? Yes, he is here. Why? Catch hold of him urgently. Hey! Stop! -What did he do? -Take a selfie with him and send it. Selfie? Why? Look here once. Ready! Hey! Damn it! He don't know even how to take a selfie but he is so keen on getting me married. -Good morning. -Hello. If you wanted to meet me, you could have told me yourself. Why do you need my selfie with your father? If you are really that interested, come and meet me. Really? Okay, I need to plan for this. I'll call you again. Bye. Hey! Hello. Just kill me. -Good morning! -Good morning. What happened? It's nothing. You said you wanted to go out. Shall I book Lola? Okay. No! Okay. [message tune] I am very excited to watch a movie with you. Okay, book it. -I am going to deal with this guy! -Okay. What did you plan? Madam, after I get off work, I was thinking of watching a movie. Oh! Remove your helmet once. Why, madam? I need to know if you are really an Lola driver or an idiot. Madam! Tell me the OTP. 6.7.2.1. -Vibha? -Isn't it nice? Then, who was that? Where are we off to madam? Let's go for a movie. Let's go. So you missed office to see me, huh? Office? Dude! She is stunning. What else? Hmm... Well? -She's asking me to talk? -What did you plan for the night? That's brazen! [message tone] I said I'd watch a movie with you... But not sitting next to you. So, watch movie with me. I made an awesome plan for the night. -Dinner in the evening, a small drive. -No. No, I am so sorry. -Night in a resort! -I am so sorry. I am sorry. It was my mistake. No. No. you are not mistaken... I am the right person. Perfect person... Baby! Baby! Baby! -Come on baby! -You bloody! -What? -Ouch! Idiot! Oh God! Oh Lord! Who the hell is he? -Brother, are you badly hurt? -He has hit me hard bother. -Do you know who hit you? -I don't know. It was me. Pleas come this side... Damn this life! I didn't knew she came with her boyfriend. What do you mean a boyfriend? I am her husband. Husband? The body there... Belongs to me. Is it okay if I hit your body? This is her body. Oh goodness! What a concept! Hey! Run! Sister! Sister! Sister! I am sorry, sister. I didn't know that you came with your husband. He thrashed me out! You and your guy stay safe. Oh God! See you, sister. -Idiot! -These rowdies never pity to hit some one. i [message tone] I dropped you safely back. You didn't even thank me. Who the hell are you? [mobile rings] You think you are my husband? You shouldn't be saying that yourself! A girl should say that. Alright. What should I do to make you say that? Easy dear! I said something like this to someone as a joke. He projected me wrong to everyone. I can't say again. Don't talk to me about someone else. I'm a different person. No matter who you are, I don't care. I don't want to get married. I don't want a husband, either. I don't need people around. And I don't want anyone around me. Just... Just leave me alone. [message tone] Listen... there's a puja at Venkateshwara Swami temple tomorrow. i It's an oath on me, you will come. i [temple bell ringing] [mobile ringing] Thanks for coming. I came to the temple. I planned for you to come to the temple. My mother called me. That is why I came. I was the one who called your mother. Don't mess with me. If you want proof, your mother is wearing a rose in her hair... Check it out. Mom... -Why did you throw what the priest gave? -The Lola guy gave it! I am not the Lola guy. I am a priest. -She wasn't talking about you. -Oh, glad its not me? Thanks for the rose. Priest... Please perform The Karthika Poornima prayers on my daughter's name. -I hope she finds a good husband. -Karthika Poornima? But today isn't Karthika Poornima! Well I got a message. Didn't you? Why would I even get a message? Don't you know the difference between a public message and a private one? You should've got it when it says 'your daughter'! Well, I am a bit dumb, you know. I was elated that you would find a good husband. So believed it. I don't believe that god can grant a good husband. No! No! That's blasphemy! Its a sin. I am getting a call from the number that messaged me. -You think it's Poornima? -One second! How many phones would you switch off? Pray to god! [mobile rings] Vibha! Dhananjaya lineage. Someone called for you. Tell them that I'll call back. I think you heard that. What are you doing? I am trying to understand you. What are you trying to understand about me? You are very confused. I told you that I made you come here and yet you didn't believe me. When I mentioned the flower, you jumped the gun. When I asked that we meet face to face. You've been avoiding me. You are very confused. So what? Listen, there are two dangers with regards this confusion. One is marriage. Second is ending up alone. That is even more dangerous. [chanting Lord Shiva's hymns] What made you do this all of a sudden? What's with that nonsensical talk? Let's move. -What's up, sir? -What? Nothing. I was just wondering where your son is? Why are you bothered about my son? He is going to be married. He is in the US, and he will be here in ten days. -Sir! Sir! -What now? Will he be coming? Or is he already here? Hey! What are you talking about? That day why did you kick the flower pot in my house? As if we have some rivalry in a Telugu movie! -Enough! -Wait. Sir, for your information, let me tell you. If your son isn't here then fine. If I get to know that he is here after my daughter... What are you talking? Are you still in hangover? -Would you guys stop. -Stop it! -Stop it both of you. -Sir, try to understand. Megha? Please get the wedding invite. -Greetings, Uncle! -My daughter-in-law. Who is he, Brother-in law? He is a father to a girl. He was enquiring after my son... I told him that his marriage is fixed. Give him the invitation, dear. Please attend the wedding. Come. Let's go. Sir... Please get your daughter married soon as well. You will be relieved too. Lord! Make him understand what I told him. i [mobile ringing] What you want is a hope. A strong hope. I placed that for you. Tell me if you can't carry it. Let's carry it together. LET'S MEET I am right behind you. I know that. Wouldn't you turn around and see me? I don't want to see you. I cannot give you the same hope that you gave me. I don't know who you are. And I don't know what you know about me. I must have been around 16 years. Once, I saw my father... With some other woman. Why did you do this, father? Why did you do this when you have mother at home? I can't get everything I want from your mother. That's why. Then, why are you still with my mother? i That is why... I am not scared when I see people who have separated or divorced. But who aren't living close to each other in their married life... I am really scared of those couples. Ever since then, I have decided that my life partner should get everything from me... And grew up with the thought that even I should get everything I want from him. I wanted to get married to my husband... That's what I thought. But my father is pushing me to marry some random guy among the ones he chose for me. He was constantly nagging me about it! That is when I thought I found the husband I was looking for. Later I realized... In a hurry, I chose a wrong shoe too. Maybe my dad was right. May be my problem is that I'm not like everyone else. Shall I tell you a bad joke? What kind of joke is that? There was a well full of frogs. Some of the frogs looked at the sky. They saw something the sky in a circle. They guessed that there was something on the top and began to jump excitedly. The frogs that were at the bottom kept repeating that there was nothing above. The frogs at the top kept listening constantly to the frogs below... They stopped jumping and settled down. But one frog kept leaping. Do you know why? Why? Because it was deaf. [Vibha chuckles] -You said that it was a bad joke. -It's not over yet. That deaf frog started to hear things. 'There is nothing on top' 'There is nothing on top' 'There is nothing on top' 'There is nothing on top' You... Remain like that deaf frog. Do you know why your stand up shows are always about husband and wife jokes? Because there is pain behind each of those comic bits. You are scared that your life will end up like that. If you want to get rid of that fear, grab on to the newness within you. Lets crack some hilarious jokes too, get out from the well soon. Vibha... I heard that you left home. You know how it feels to be rejected, don't you? -Hey! -Hey! What is your problem? Just stop it! It was because I didn't tell you that I got married. You are such a hot thing that even a married man gets disturbed! Give me one chance. Just one chance. You always give everyone a minute, don't you? Give me a minute as well. [Vibha screams] -I am sure you will not regret this. -Stop it! -Hey, please once... -Stop it. -Calm down! -I was so scared. What happened? i Calm down! Okay, don't worry. i First, calm down. I am telling you right now. I am going to come up. Shall I? Then, calm down. Listen... You are not alone. Believe me, you are not alone. Please sit down for a while. Hey! Hello? Hello? Sing a lullaby for me! Please stay online until I fall asleep. Ah! Please don't be that scared of me. You acted well and made sure I was thrashed. You should have told me that someone like him is in your life. You should wish to spend your entire lifetime with a girl like her. Instead, you ask for a minute? Who the hell are you to lecture me?! He said something else! Next time when she sees you or remembers you... She shouldn't be scared of you at all. Instead you should bring some good laughters. -Go. -Thank you! Hold your smile. "The entire sky up there is filled with happiness." i "And it's breaking into dawn for me" i "All my thoughts are in a hurry" i "And are eagerly searching out for today." i "This life today... Is smiling anew." i "This magical spell is his." i "The poetry keeps flowing" i "My life turns into light" i "I found a mate today... Like him." i "The corner is my lips are decorated with his name." i "He is the reason for my smile." i "Need none..." i "If he is with me that's enough." i "All these moments with him are perfumed with happiness." i "This new beginning of me is because of you" i "Let me be complete with you." i "The entire sky up there is filled with happiness." i "And it's breaking into dawn for me" i "All my thoughts are in a hurry" i "And are eagerly searching out for today." i "This life today... Is smiling anew." i "This magical spell is his." i "The poetry keeps flowing" i "My life turns into light" i "I found a mate today... Like him." i LET'S MEET Did you listen when I told you? When my daughter who left her father's house returned; I assumed that I have a son-in-law. What horrid fate! I am stuck with this fellow again. When did you come? -Father... -When did you come? Ask him the reason for his visit. I came for Vibha. -This wedding isn't right for me. -Not right for you?! Why are you so confused in selecting a right life partner for you? Those idiotic questions that girl asked, would keep you up for few days. And after that, you would face reality. These fantasies won't keep you together. Only one thing can keep everyone together. It's the quality of adjusting. To have a successful married life, that is the foremost eligibility. Since we all know that reality... We are able to lead our lives happily together. You don't understand all this... You are so confused despite being the most eligible for marriage. You are the one who doesn't understand, dad. To live a happily married life, there are other eligibilities. If that's the case, my daughter should be with you. Where is she? -She will come. -No, she won't. -She will come. -No, she won't. Is he the one you are gonna meet? I hope you do remember his name? Harsha! His wedding is in three days. Last time he came to meet me before his engagement. And now he comes to meet you before his wedding. Doesn't he ever make a proper visit? And you believe that he is someone who can give you all that you want. Is it? Bro... We figured that we are living a compromised life. You said that there is some other way. Why don't you tell that? I don't think you would understand if I explain. I need to prove it. And, to prove it, I need Vibha with me. You had called her so many times and she didn't pick up; I think she is hurt again. If she is hurt, she would come down and joke about it. Since that didn't happen, I am still hopeful. Well, we're getting late as well. We have a wedding to attend close by. Tell us where we can drop you. Whose wedding are you off to, bro? Megha and Harsha. How are you related to Megha? She is my cousin, bro. And you? I am Harsha, bro. Dear! What's your problem, dear? Do you know life will be delighted if you get married? -Tell me what's your problem? -Please stop. -Tell me... Come on tell me... -Hey, that is hell like living with you. It's like hell? How I took good care of you? I took very good care of you. Snag lullabies, made maggie for you. Stop that nonsense. For the first time, I think I need a shoulder. First time... Not the shoulder I want, but... When nothing is available. Go for the reachable. Come dear. Do you know Vibha? What do you mean you don't know her? She is such a big stand-up comedian! During wedding, all the rituals are quiet boring. This time, it's stand-up comedy time. Come on, get ready What is this? Why does that girl come here? She came here to do a stand-up show. She will leave after that. Even if she doesn't make us laugh, I'm fine. It would be glad if she doesn't make a joke of us. Harsha! Vibha must be very hurt. I wonder what kind of jokes she is gonna come up with? I hope that jokes won't be on you. For the first time in Indian history, physics, chemistry and geography... A stand-up show at a wedding. This is Vibha! Congratulations to the bride and groom! Thank you. Husband- wife jokes are my all time saviours. Dear, please stop cracking jokes on us. -Why? -No. -No? -No. Alright! I'll talk about myself. There's a person who influenced me a lot in my life. His name is... Subbu! My father. What you thought is right. His name is Subramanyam. But if you listen to my story, You would feel that it's an honor to even call him Subbu. Really. That is how much he irritated me. If I ask Subbu the same thing... He would say that I was the one who was rejecting grooms and torturing him. He was showing me the photos of grooms like a pack of cards. I was expecting a king. But all the 13 cards turned out to be jokers. Whom can I select if all of them were jokers? Game drop and I bolted from there. Really. That is when he came. My prince! I didn't want to get married at all. My prince kept wooing me, writing cute dating notes... On my note book, without my knowledge. I thought it must be some joker that Subbu sent my way. And so, I got on an Lola bike. And then, he started making conversations. I didn't know how an entire day went by. After I got down from the bike... I got to know that he wasn't an Lola bike rider. He was the idiot who wrote those things on my book. I suspected that Subbu's joker might not be that smart. So, I challenged him to meet me. I asked him to come to fix him up. To get rid of the fear of marriage out of my mind... He placed a pink balloon with 'you need a hope' written on it. Hope should strengthen me, right? He gave me that strength through this balloon. I kept thinking about it and roamed around the entire city. That is when I met a guy. There were bushes all around. There was no one around. I started shivering... I asked that guy what it was that he wanted. He said he wanted a chance. I somehow escaped from that guy and got back home. But I was still shivering. I thought that the only way to get rid of fear was to talk to someone... And so, I searched my entire contact list. I didn't feel like calling anyone. I thought of calling Subbu... But I knew he would end up asking me questions like 'Why did you go there?' He wouldn't understand my situation. Suddenly I felt like I was all alone. It doesn't matter how many numbers you have in your contact list... We need a person with whom anything can be shared at any moment. May be that is why people get married. That is when I got his message. 'Calm down!' 'You are not alone!' it said. That one phrase gave me a lot of courage. I asked him to sing me a lullaby until I fell asleep. And he kept singing until I slept. After so many days, I had a peaceful sleep. All those fears that I stuffed inside me because of my father... He simply wiped them all away with a fable. Invisibly he showed me how a married life with him would look like. I thought of meeting him. I waited for him so that I could proudly show to my father that 'he is the one'. But before that, my father broke a shocking news. That, he is going to get married. For the first time ever, there were tears in my eyes. Not because he cheated me. He came back for me for what I said a long time ago! I always thought that someone must have been born for me. But I wondered, he was born from my words? Did he really put so much effort to make my toppling life steady? He said, 'Hold your smile'. Is he trying hard all alone to make his family accept me? When I think about him... I still can't stop tears falling from my eyes. Right now, I just want to hug him. But I don't know if I would ever be able to hug him in this lifetime. Please forgive me for stopping the story here. Stop. I stopped. Tell me. Whether you want to go and get married or do something else, it's your call. Go and live as you please. From now on, you and I are no way related. But, before you go, apologize to the girl and leave. Megha... Do you want me to apologise to you, Or do you want me to explain why I should marry Vibha? Vibha already met me and explained everything to me. I understood everything. I was the one who called her. But uncle... I think you haven't understood Harsha properly. Exactly! The other day I wanted to explain it to you all so that you would understand. But you said that the girl wasn't beside me and she wouldn't come either. Now that girl is here. I don't understand why you would want me to leave without explaining myself. What was it that you said? The only eligibility one needs to live a happily married life is to compromise? There is something else too, father. We saw in Vibha's words... Romance! That is the right eligibility. The very first day I met Vibha, she asked me this. What do you expect from your married life? And I like a fool blabbered something. I said even love. Later I realised. Romance is greater than love. I want a very romantic married life. What does that mean? You think we are just sailing through married life without any romance? Is that how we had our children? Uncle, how do I explain it to you? You understand love. I don't understand, when I say romance, you presume something negative. Why? Romance isn't some quick lovemaking behind closed doors done in ten minutes. Romance means... Showing love in action. Everyone says that they are in love. But how many of those people actually show their love with actions? Hey... How could you say we all don't show it? I show love in action. Hold on... Hold on... How is it that you show your love? You mean the way you buy gifts and throw them on the table and ask her to take it? It isn't about just buying some expensive gift, sir. It's about going to her and showering it on her, and making her feel happy. That is how you show love! Is that how you speak to your elders? Don't you think we know better? When your husband is around you... You insist that he earn in crores and demand you live luxuriously. But when he is away to earn for you You complain that he isn't around. If you show a bit of love... You would know which is the true luxury. If not, they simply pass a statement that a single person cannot satisfy them. If one person cannot satisfy you, no one else can. Two people get married is to be happy But they only end up making each other suffer. Instead of teaching us how to make that suffering stop, When you keep saying that it's better to compromise... I feel like you insist me to live a lifeless life. I don't want to live that kind of life beside my partner. I want to be very very closer to my life partner. Vibha is a kind of girl who knows how to live. To make sure one's married life stays young and interesting, Vibha is someone who knows that a great romance is essential. Understanding that one's body isn't just our own but our life partner's too... The thought of taking care of one's body and being healthy is so romantic. With her husband beside her and in a never ending conversation... A girl wishing for that sort of life such a romantic notion. I like sunset. Because I know, my life partner is waiting for me at home... And that increases my desire to live. If thinking this way is dirty-minded, one does need to be a bit dirty-minded. What was it that you said, uncle? Is it to get married or to have an affair? It is to be as good as having an affair. For an ever lasting affair. As I didn't know all these things, I hung my head down in the court. Now, I proudly say this. I'll have a great married life. Get me married to Vibha. I thought he would be on his knees, but he nailed it instead! Son... The girl might be feeling low, go and talk to her to cheer her up. Go hug her. My mom asked me to hug you. What else? She told me to cheer you up. What else? I need to have at least 25 thousand meals with you. I need to share at least nine thousand nights with you. And I need to go hundreds of vacations with you. And above all... We need to have millions of conversations. Sir... Shall we get married? -This seat? -Is mine. One minute... -Boss! -Yes! We are a newly married couple. I had mistakenly booked two aisle seats. Could you please move to 4B? -Nope. -Why? -My wife is seated in 4A. -Huh? [laughs aloud] I did it on purpose. It's okay. This is our first journey, isn't it? Let's make it memorable. Even though there is a gap of 18 inches between the both of us At a height of 35,000 feet above the ground... And a travel time of 16 hours together... We spoke about a lot of things. She must have blushed some 17 times. We laughed together 34 times. I leave it to your dirty mind how romantic our journey on the plane was.
