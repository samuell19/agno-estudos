NEOPLANTA FILM JUNE TURMOIL cinematography director And later came Veljko Vlahović, Miloš Minić and Branko Pešić. They demanded that the students retreat peacefully to the campus in order to reach an agreement to hold peaceful demonstrations there, so that we wouldn't go to the Marx and Engels Square at all. He also demanded that a certain number of students retreat... ...to retreat and agree about the demonstrations. And we retreated there under that tree... ...and we reached an agreement. That's what happened, although some where not for retreat, most of us were for the students to go back. I went with Miloš Minić to stop the police and the students. First we stopped the students and then we stopped the police, which we did with great effort, and even comrade Minić himself suffered a few blows to the head with a policeman's baton. A girl, who is to be a mother one day and to be able to raise her own children, should not have been, from their side, treated like that. Two of them holding her while the third beats her on the breasts with a baton. They told us like: 'You whores, if you bear children similar to you, better kill yourselves, because we don't need your kind.' One of the students was carrying a girl, and they didn't want to beat him, they beat that girl. If... if slogans don't prove anything, like: 'Long live socialism', 'With Tito we walk', etc., then... One of the greatest offences for us was when we were told to remove the slogans which we carried when we surrounded the campus, and amongst the slogans and banners there were pictures of Tito, Lenin, flags. However, he beat me so much but I only blame myself and accuse myself of begging him in the first place. I put my hands together in prayer, and beg him not to beat me on the belly, to beat me on the back instead, I think it would have been easier for me to whistand the blows there. He paid no attention to that. At that moment, a colleague came and said: 'Don't beat her, beat me.' Immediately two men showed up and started beating him. We are going to talk here all night, we are going to sing, we are going to recite, and we are not going to be provoked by anyone! But at the same time, those who intend to provoke us, they should know, we are staying here because of dignity and not because of fear! 'Red University - Karl Marx' 'Down with the dukes of socialism' Revolutionary tune. 'Who is responsible for the economy chaos?' 'Searching for solution to unemployment' If there were no winds, spiders would weave a web all over the sky! Students - workers, students - workers! They proclaim that national problem is the main problem in our country. The main problem in this country is a social problem! The abyss of hell threatens in vain, the fire of thunder is in vain. Now let everything above us be carried away by the storm. The rock cracks, the oak breaks, let the ground shake. We stand steadfastly like cliffs; Let the traitor of his homeland be damned! Let me say this... A few moments ago, I was with comrade Vitomir Teofilović in the printing press office 'Glas'. I was told that the head office of 'Student' is under siege, so we went there to see what was happening. There we found fifty policemen and an armed vehicle, and a few other policemen... Boo, boo! I beg you not to let yourselves be provoked by this any more. We will do everything we can to respond to this brutal attack of censorship and the police. - But let... - For how long!? We continue our strike. If they're taking away our 'Student', they still can't take away our hectographs based in our cellars. 'We question the trustworthiness of the political leaders.' Let me quote Karl Marx and his opinion on the freedom of the press and censorship. 'Just like everyone learns how to read and write, everyone must be allowed to read and write!' Certainly, revolutionary goverment is the despotism of freedom! Freedom... against tyranny! All the signs of a false sensitiveness seem to me like sighs flying towards England and Austria. However, not being satisfied by disarming the force of the people. they are trying to poison the holiest sources of its power by vice. It is the most cunning, the most dangerous and the most hideous attack on freedom. Vice is Cain's mark of aristocratism! In a republic, vice is not only moral, but also political crime! A corrupted man is a political enemy of freedom! That's right! You will understand my words if you just think of the people who used to live in attics, and now ride in carriages and practice lechery with former marchionesses and baronesses! Steva, Steva! When we watch... ...how the legislators boast with vice and prodigality of former courtiers, how they make witty, pungent remarks and emphasize their artistic tastes, how they already acquired some rules of posh behaviour, when we watch these marquises and counts of revolution gamble, when we look at them, with every right we can ask: 'Have they robbed the people?' Yes, they have! Yes, they have! There is no agreement, no truce with those people... No! ...for whom the Republic represented speculation, and the revolution a trade!
