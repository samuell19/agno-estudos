[machinery humming] [dramatic music] Is it OK? OK? Did you say OK? It's great! If you weren't so [muted] ugly, I'd kiss you. How much do you think you've printed? About $45 million, give or take $100,000. How long for an extra $5 million? Let's see, about two hours. OK. Go for it. Wait, wait, wait, Manny. Manny, please. Let me have the pleasure of turning it on. Oh, god, I love this! And they say there's no money in printing. [machinery humming] [door clicks] What'd you turn the press back on for? BORIS: An extra 5 mil. Fazio said 45. We're going to give him 45. If Fazio doesn't want the extra 5 mil, I'll keep it. My, but we're getting a little cocky, aren't we? Yeah, don't worry about Fazio. He doesn't scare me. Yeah. But you don't want to [muted] with him. No. But I do want to [muted] with you. What's gotten into you, Boris, huh? What, you got a death wish or something? Oh, come on, Mona. You can pretend all you want, but I can see right through you. You know you want me, and I know I want you. So what do you say after tonight we take the extra 5 mil and we blow this town forever. [intercom buzzing] Who's that, huh? Food. Yeah? We ordered some pizza. I even ordered one for you. [intercom buzzing] How much? $29.50. $29.50. Here's $40. Keep the change. - Thank you very much, sir. - Sure. [gunshots] [gunshots] [gun cocks] [gunshots] Tony? What are you doing?! All clear, boss. Tony, no! Look who I found, boss. Hello, Mona. Where's Fazio? Miami. Miami? Is he coming to LA, or are you going there? I'm supposed to meet him there. Have you got anything to say to me, Mona? I'm sorry. I said I'm sorry! I didn't mean to hurt you. I'm sorry. I'm sorry-- Shh. Come on. Let's kiss and make up. Come on. Don't be afraid. No. [crying] Come on. Come on. [inaudible] [mona yells] Come on, let's move it! We don't have all day. Move! [knocking] Come in. What's wrong, David? How do you know there's something wrong? You always enter my office very quietly when there's something wrong. LAPD discovered a print shop. Counterfeit? DAVID: Yes. Well, get Parkinson down there. He's already on his way. Good. Let's get five more men down there. Top detectives from different precincts. I want their reports on my desk in the morning, OK? They'll be there. Hello. I know it's late, but something's come up. [honking] Good. You look beautiful. Well, thank you. Ow. - What is that? - Open it. I'm taking my time. You like it? It's beautiful, Jack. Well? Well what? [jack laughs] Well, is it, uh-- is it yes or no? Is it yes or no what? Dorothy, come on. Why don't you ask me? Ask you? I just gave you a ring, for Christ's sake. Ask me. Come here. Come here. (WHISPERING) You wanna get married? (WHISPERING) No. No? Not like that, I don't. Wait a second. For three years, you've been ragging on me to marry you. And now you say no? I didn't say no. Well, you didn't say yes either. What do you want? You want-- you want me on my knees here? You want me to beg? - Yeah. You know what, Jack? If you really loved me, you would. Right here. On my knees. Mm-hmm. Right here. [pager beeping] I'll be right back. Jack, no. Look, your phone call can wait. Jack, it took me three years to get you to do this. I'm not going to wait another three years for you to ask me again. Now, get on your knees and ask me in the proper way. Let me make the phone call first, all right? I'll be right-- Yeah, Saxon here. WOMAN (ON PHONE): Yeah, Jack. Captain wants you to drop-- Six dead bodies. And get this, they even shot the pizza guy. It's at 63rd and Wilton. It's probably some kind of counterfeiting operation. Uh, it's 63rd and what? WOMAN (ON PHONE): Wilton. 63rd and Wilton. I'm on my way. [gunshot] MAN: Nobody move! [gunshot] [screaming] All right, people. Calm down. Calm down. It's a hold up. Nobody move. Everybody sit down. Now, I want you to put all your wallets, and your jewelry, and your purses on the tables now. Come on, move! [gunshots] Dorothy? Are you all right? Yes. I'm on my knees, honey. Marry me? Yes, I'll marry you. JACK: Yeah? DOROTHY: Yes. I gotta go to work. [spanish music playing] [panting] Hello, Susan. Hey, Manny. What happened to you? We got hit. Yeah? What, the cops? It wasn't the cops. Listen, Susan. You think you can me a favor? What? Can I stay here for a while? You're not going to get me in any trouble, are you? No, no. I swear to God I won't-- I won't get you in any trouble. All right. All right, you can stay a few days. What's in the box, Manny? Hmm? What's in the box, Manny? A few thousand dollars of counterfeit money and a plate. A plate? What plate? What's a plate? In a month's time, I'm going to be able to print my own money. Print your own money? You're telling me you're gonna be able to print money? All I gotta do is find the paper. You know what, Manny? I like that. I like that a whole lot. I knew you would. It's about time you showed up. What? The guys from the FBI are waiting for you. What's the FBI want with me, huh? They think the guy that did the job on the girl is a Vietnam vet, so they want every detective that's going to be assigned to the case to have either served in Vietnam or have some knowledge of Nam. So what the hell are you doing here? That's very funny, Jack, but the captain sent me to keep your [muted] in line. To make sure you don't embarrass the department. Embarrass 'em, huh? Yeah. You got a new suit there, huh? Come on, Jack. You look great. Yeah? Tie? These were found in the warehouse. They are the best we have ever seen. We don't know how much of it is out there. But with the presses they are using, they can print $3 million in an hour. That's $30 million in 10 hours. About a billion a month. If they set up two or three printers, in six months, gentlemen, you can purchase one of these bills for one Mexican peso. You're late, Saxon. Yes, ma'am, I'd like to apologize. I had to go to the coroner's office to pick up these reports for you. These reports were faxed to me earlier this morning. That's why you're here. Sit down, Detective. Yes, ma'am. There's a definite connection between the two parties. They know of each other's locations and operations. So it's assumed that the man knew the girl he murdered. Examination of her neck wound proves him to be tall, very strong. 6 foot 2 or 6 foot 4. The method and the knife are the exact kind used in Vietnam to dispose of the enemy quickly and quietly. In the parking lot, all the vehicles were rentals, of course under assumed names. By the end of the evening, gentlemen, I want you to find out everything that you can about the victims. Where they lived, where they worked. Are you with me? Absolutely. Wives, husbands. Any countries they may have visited lately. Everything. This is a national emergency, and we have to do everything we can to stop it. Excuse me, uh, what about the witness? What witness? Well, it says here, according to the officer Steven Jacobs, who arrived first on the scene, that the lights in the warehouse were off. Now, the switch to the light is approximately 25 feet from the door. Now, you actually think that the killers, after hauling out all this cash, are going to go back inside and turn off the lights? I don't think so. So what I think is, uh, somebody must've been hiding in there, either the printer or the night watchman. And when he left, by habit he turned the lights off. Therefore, a witness. That's great work. Find him. Thank you. Uh, there's one other thing. There were three racing forms found at the location. So, uh, I think it'll be a hell of an idea if we all took the day off and went to the racetrack and staked the thing out-- No, Saxon, I don't want you functioning in any public place. I've heard enough of your carefree shootouts on the streets, and in restaurants, and in airports. We are afraid that one day you may miss the enemy and shut down the public. I can explain the restaurant. You're all dismissed. Let me ask you this. A guy drops a million dollars worth of counterfeit money in your hands. What are you gonna do with it? Buy a new wardrobe. Exactly. You buy a new wardrobe, new cars, new women, nude women. Maybe I'd exchange it. Make it good. Oh, no, that's too risky. A crooked bank is only going to give you $0.20 on a dollar. OK, how about this. If it's all in 20s, I take it out and spread it around myself-- That's gonna take you forever. Hey, what do I care? I don't have a job. I mean, all I gotta do all day is spend money. Yeah, but after a while, you're gonna get bored with that. Yeah, well, I'd like to try it sometime. - Snow cone? - Yeah. Are you buying? - Sure. Come esta, amigo? Uh, dos frio snow cones, por favor. That's very good, Jack. Grazie. Grazie. Well, how about this. How about mixing business with pleasure. What is that supposed to mean? What that means is, uh-- I love the ponies, right? I enjoy a good race every now and then. Lots of money exchanges hands out there at the racetrack. No, Jack. Absolutely no. We are gonna be good little detectives and check on of the victims' places of residence. Well, then you go check on the victims' places of residence. I'll go sneak off to the racetrack. No. I'm not letting you out of my sight. Look, Jack, if we [muted] this up, we're both going to be looking for a job. Who's gonna know, Bert? I'll know. Don't tell anybody. Well, the captain will know. Don't tell the captain. Yeah, well, as soon as you start blowing people away-- [muted] damn it, Bert. I'm not gonna blow anybody away. I'll wait till you get there. No. Can you believe what the world's coming to? They got two kids here, 13 and 12, pulled a bank job. Got away with 180 grand. When I was their age, I was in school robbing lunch money. [mario laughs] Look at this. They got Reagan working for the Japs. He's getting millions as a public speaker. It says he's going in for an operation. He's gonna get his eyes slanted! [laughs] Knock it off. Thank you. Any mention of the hit? MARIO: They don't say a thing. So what else is new? The government hides everything else from us. What did Remus say? He said if the quality's good, $0.15 on the dollar. $0.15? Did you tell him they were all in 20s? - I told him. - And? He said $0.15. I can get $0.25 to $0.30 on the dollar. Maybe, maybe not. Remus came highly recommended. You know we're not in the counterfeit business. This isn't a one-shot deal. I say we shouldn't sit on it too long. We? I'm sorry, boss. Tony, Tony. Maybe you're right. I just don't like the idea of some Puerto Rican Jew gonna take my money and turn around and make $10 million. When is he gonna take it? He said he'll give us a call. He'll give us a call. Ay yay yay. You OK? No. I've got a headache. Get me some aspirin to fix my back. I'll see you momentarily. Hey, Mario. Why don't you clean up? Yeah, OK. Hey, you mind if I ask you something? - What? - Can I get a couple hours off? Why? They're having a sale. I want to pick up a couple of suits. What are you, crazy? Can't you see the boss has a headache and he doesn't feel good? The boss has always got a headache. He never feels good. Why should today be different? Hey, Mario. Just clean it. JACK: So what do you got? First up, Mona Kingsley. Born in Ohio to Stewart and Mary Kingsley. 28 years old. Single At age 22, she worked for the same bank her mother worked for. Here we go. Mona stole $20,000 from the bank vault. Sentenced to 10 years. She did three. Got paroled on good behavior and promised to return the money. So you finally popped the question. JACK: What are you talking about? It's all over the station, Jack. I mean, the way I got the story is you were on your hands and knees begging the broad to marry you. That's [muted]. Hey, come on, Jack. We've been friends for a long time, man. I mean, you don't have to play macho with me. I'm not playing macho with you. What I'm telling you is there's no way in hell that I'm going to get down on my knees for a woman or anybody else. OK, Jack, whatever you say. Now, what's that supposed to mean? Nothing. Nothing? Anything? Nothing out of the ordinary. Except for these two first class airline tickets. Where to? Paris, France. Paris? Well, everything is, uh, real nice and neat here, isn't it, Bert? What are you saying? What I'm saying is Mona's got herself a housekeeper or a maid. Which means somebody is going to come here pretty soon. Absolutely. So I should call the captain and get him to stake out the place. Absolutely. Martin Abeco 32, divorced. One daughter, seven years old. Wife has custody of the kid, and they live in Jacksonville, Florida. Martin was born in Little Italy, New York. At age 16, he broke into a department store and stole a mannequin. Kinky. At 23, he went back and got the-- stole the jewelry. JACK: So where are we headed? Long Beach. Anybody contact his wife? No. Captain says we keep this quiet until we find something out. What do you think, was he paying alimony and child support? It doesn't say here. Well, if Mr. Abeco was a good father, maybe he was sending his ex-wife an envelope full of cash once a month. Jack, nobody sends their ex-wife cash. No? No. Well, how do you pay your alimony? Once a month I give her a check signed in my own blood. Then I pray the [muted] chokes on it. [jack laughs] JACK: So when are you getting married again? (SINGING) Can't you feel the breeze -- the breeze-- breeze hitting on your ear? Can't you hear-- hear the air's escaping out the other side-- Hey, Mario. Why don't you knock that off? What am I doing now? No wonder the boss has a headache. Besides, he doesn't want anyone playing his piano. You have good news for me? I just talked to Remus. Now he's saying he only can take $10 million at a time. That's not the deal. He's saying there's feds all over the place. He can't move that much money at one time. He's not going to tell you it's a walk in the park, is he? Is he? And you know something else? We're going to get a call from that mother-mother-[muted], and he's gonna try to negotiate the price down to nothing. Nothing. Well, he did say if we want to dump it all at once, we have to take a cut. Take a cut? How much of a cut? $0.10 on the dollar. $0.10 on the dollar. [laughs] How generous. $0.10 on the dollar. Fine. Arrange for it. I don't think we should. And tell him I want to do the exchange someplace out of town. It's too cheap. We should insist on $0.20. Arrange for it, Tony. All right. Tony. Send Angelo in. I want to talk to him now. You're not gonna do what I think you're gonna do. You already have problems with Fazio. You want to have the same thing with Remus too? Fazio doesn't even know we hit him. And as far as Remus is concerned, he doesn't have the power or the guts [muted].. Why don't we just take the deal? And why don't you just do what I tell you to? OK? OK. [speaking spanish] [speaking spanish] - [speaking spanish] - It's perfect, man. [speaking spanish] [speaking spanish] [speaking spanish] Oh, [muted]. [explosion bangs] [gunshots] [muffled whispering] [distant gunshots] [bomb whistling] Where to now? [explosion bangs] This way. Come on, move it. Let's go! I can't. My leg, all right? Where the hell are we? We're going to hit the river in two hours. Now, move it. Yeah, you said that three hours ago! Well, I'm sorry I didn't pick a map up at the AAA. [muted] wait-- The sun's gonna be up in two hours. If we don't hit that river, we're dead. You understand me, soldier? He's right, Smittee. Come on, we gotta do it. I can't do it, Jack. All right? My leg is killing me. [distant gunshots] Do you hear that? He can't do it. Let's lay low for an hour until all this [muted] passes. [explosion bangs] MILLER: I'm out of here, boys. OK, then you walk on out of here. Adios. [bomb whistling] [distant gunshots] All right. Half an hour, that's it. The only thing I can think about is this little place back home. Yeah, it serves these, uh, 32-ounce t-bone steaks, Idaho potatoes with sour cream and chives, and pie a la mode. Aw. It's all I can think about. I'm gonna buy you one when we get back. So what's the first thing you're gonna do when you get back to the world? I'm gonna go home and kill my wife. Back cook, huh? No, she's [muted] every guy on the block. Really? What's her address? [laughing] [bomb whistling] [explosion bangs] Get him up. We're getting out of here. Come on. Come on. [gunshots] Were almost there. Don't talk. Don't talk. I'm not afraid. I know, you're brave. You're brave. Don't leave me, Jack. No, man, I'm right here. Don't leave me. I ain't going nowhere, Smittee. I ain't going nowhere. Oh, Smittee. No. Smittee! Jack. It's 3:30, Jack. It's 3:30, Jack. It was 2:15 in the morning when I was thrown from the bar, Dorothy. What's bothering you? Oh, nothing. Is it me? You know, if you're worried about the engagement, we can call it off. It's not the, uh-- Engagement. Jesus, I hate it when you try and fill in the blanks. Do you know that? I mean, I'm not one of your seventh grade students. Look, I'm sorry, Jack. Hey. You know when the last time we made love was? What is this, a quiz, teacher? You know, I hate it when you make fun of everything. Why can't you just tell me what's wrong? What's wrong with you? What's wrong with me? What's wrong with Jack? Come here. What's wrong? Oh, my god. Oh, I'm gonna tell your students what a nasty, vulgar, sexual thing you are. They already know. I'll bet they do. Later, Bert. BERT: Where you going? Pawn shop. BERT: Pawn shop? Hey, wait, wait, whoa. What's in a pawn shop? What's in a pawn shop? Jeez, you got jewelry, TV, radios, Walkmen. All sorts of good-- - Oh, come on, Jack. Don't get smart with me. All right. Bert. I found the number of this pawn shop on one of the racing forms. I just want to go over there and have a little chat with them, that's all. So you think the pawn shop might be a front for a bookie joint? No, Bert, I know it's a front for a bookie joint. All right. Will you let me handle this? - You want to handle it? Yeah. Go ahead. You go handle it. Where is it? [laughs] - See? You need me, Bert. BERT: Excuse me. EARL: Yeah. Can I have a word with you? I want to talk to the owner. Yeah, I'm the owner. What's your name? Earl. Earl, I'm Detective Bert White. Yeah, I know. You're a cop. So what? So I want to ask you a few questions. I'm busy. Come back later. Jack. Are you sure this is a bookie joint? Yep. All right, look, I'm gonna call Judge Huxley and get a warrant. No, no, no. We should handle this. - No, no. You stay here. I'll handle it. Good luck. Excuse me. Excuse me! Look, on Thursday the 28th, somebody called here and placed a bet on a horse. What are you, blind? This is a pawn shop! [gun cocks] [gunshot] You listen to me. We're looking for a man or woman who placed a bet here on the 28th. He or she could quite possibly be in the printing business, and they always pay in brand-new $20 bills. Now, you got two sec-- [floor creaks] [gunshot] You have two seconds to answer the question. 1, 2-- Manny Gonzales. Address? I don't know his address! Well, I suggest you call an ambulance. Congratulations, Jack. There's 458 homicides in LA, and you're responsible for over 10% of them. Hey, I told you to watch him. I told you to check with me, because I'm responsible. Did I authorize you to go to a pawn shop? No, sir. CAPTAIN BROWN: This guy's got no respect for human life! Well, excuse me, sir. Uh, this guy was about ready to shoot-- All right, just shut up. JACK: Well, I-- Shut up! Mike, you are a disgrace to this department. I am sick and tired of taking all this heat from you, I'm not taking your [muted] no more. Sir, I was there. Detectives Sax-- Shut up! You, you're on suspension four weeks, no pay. Four weeks? Now, get out of here. I think that's a little stiff. Just get out! God-[muted]. BERT: Do you ever think about the people you've killed, Jack? The first one. That one stayed with me a long time. I don't think I could do it, Jack. Do what? I don't think I could pull the trigger. I don't think I could kill anybody. Come on, Bert. If it comes down between you and some scumbag, you're gonna pull the trigger. I don't think so, Jack. What the hell's the matter with you, huh? Why'd you become a cop? I don't know, everybody in my family is a cop. Bert, you're talking to me. All right. I want to be a cop, Jack. You know, I've always had this dream of bringing down a drug lord or a serial killer, maybe even a bank robber. The best I've ever done, Jack, was some fat hooker who cut up her pimp, and even then I had to call in for backup. Bert, you're gonna be fine, all right? Don't worry. Now, what's your next move? Get a new partner. That's good, that's good. I don't know, I guess I'll go look for Manny. Find out where he hangs out, pick him up. Look for the girl. What girl? Manny's girl. A man is hurting, a man's in trouble, he turns to a woman. Make him feel good. Take care. Is that where you're heading, Jack? Hey, Bert, now you're learning. Great, great. Hi, sweetie. Good, good, good. Stay in line. Stay in line. Good, good, good. Good. Keep going, keep going. Keep it up. Looking good, ladies. Very good, girls. You're so good. Well, you made it, huh? Yeah. Oh, drinking on the job, huh? No, celebrating. I've been, uh, temporarily fired. Well, what did you do this time? Same old stuff. Put some skates on and you'll feel better. Come on. - No, no. I don't-- I don't think so. Are you afraid that you're gonna fall in front of the kids? Basically, yes. DOROTHY: So what? They could use a good laugh. - Come here. - What? Come here. Jack, not here in front of the kids. But I love you. What did you say? The man said he loves you. Yeah, and I love him too. I'm going. No, no, no, no. Will I see you later? Yeah, sure. What do you say, uh, I pick you up and take you out for a steak? Oh, why don't we stay home and I'll cook you a steak? I say that's a good idea. OK. OK. Not until you put skates on, though. - No. - Yes, Jack. You promised. - No, no-- Jack. Hey, Jack, you promised. Back off. Wimp! Oh, come back here. You're such a chicken. I fell. Oh. You didn't hurt the ice, did you? - No. - OK. You're OK? - Mm-hmm. OK, let's go stake. Come on, sweetie. Wee! [kids laughing] Where'd you get this? First National Bank. There was a deposit made last night by the racetrack. Saxon was right. DAVID: Yes, he was. What's he up to now? Now, it seems he shot a couple of hardcore criminals at a pawn shop. He was suspended. He was suspended? Yes. - Who suspended him? - Well, Captain Brown. You tell Captain Brown to get down here right away, will you? I want to speak to Captain Brown. Fine. JOHN: You know what the worst part about this job is? No, what? You know what it is? No, John, tell me. The waiting. I mean, while this guy's up there fornicating his brains out, watching television, eating, alls we got to do is sit here and wait. Why don't we just go up and get him, huh? Because we don't give a damn about him. We don't? No, John. We want his boss. If he keeps losing at the track, eventually he's gonna run out of money, and he's gotta go back to his boss and get more. Then we get the both of 'em. You know, I never thought of that. [patchy piano playing] Oh, I don't know. Sometimes I think you have to be born with this. Hey, Mario. Yeah, boss? You've Seen me practice. Do you think I'm getting better or worse? Oh, yeah, you're definitely getting better. I was just telling the boys how much you've improved. So you really think these piano lessons are paying off? Oh, yeah. It's like the broad says, you just gotta keep practicing. You know, it's like-- you just gotta keep plunking away. Mario. I told you before. Don't touch the piano. Sorry, boss. [patchy piano playing] Boss. I hate to bother you while you're practicing, but, uh, something's come up. What is it? Well, the good news is, uh, Fazio doesn't know we hit him. He struck back on some Colombian dealer thinking he was responsible. Apparently they were doing business together. And the bad news? We left a witness at the warehouse. Manny Gonzales. I say we should get him before he gets to Fazio or the cops. [piano playing] Yes. I got it. [laughing loudly] MANNY: Hey, Susan. What is that? SUSAN: Mixed media. Oh. What is it you're painting? Abstract, Manny. Abstract. You-- you actually get paid for this [muted]?? Manny, you're getting on my nerves. Now, why don't you go sit down, huh? Could you fix me up? Manny, fix yourself up! I mean, you're getting on my [muted] nerves here. Manny, take some sleeping pills. And why don't you take a shower? You're starting to stink. Did I miss anything? No, nothing. Here, I brought you a cup of coffee. Thanks. The coffee's cold. - Of course it's cold. I walked a mile with it. What do you expect? If you let me take the car, then you get hot coffee. You don't let me take the car, you get cold coffee. He didn't come down yet, did he? No, John, he didn't come down yet. I didn't think so. [clicking] You hear something? SUSAN: No, man. You're hallucinating again. Where's Manny? TONY: Hold it, Manny. Just sit down and relax. Manny, Manny. Were you in the warehouse? [indistinct wailing] I was closing the warehouse! I was closing the warehouse. And I don't like liars. Where were you hiding? A box. In a box. [laughing] He was hiding in a box. [laughing] Where's the plate? Pardon me? Look, I can be very valuable for you. I can print you money. A billion dollars. I can make you rich. You can make me rich. Manny's gonna make me rich. Oh, Manny. Manny, Manny, your humor never ceases to amaze me. And did you tell anybody that you saw me? No. You're not lying to me-- No. - Did you tell Fazio? - No. Did you tell the cops? Nobody! You're not lying to me, are you, Manny?! Don't kill me! Please, don't kill me. No, I'm not gonna kill you. No. [yelling] [tires screeching] Call for back up, and cover the back alley. This is Officer Jackson and White. We're at 12255 Oxford on the east side. We've got a dead body in the middle of the street. Please send back up. More coffee, sweetie? Yeah, please. Breakfast is served. Yeah. [phone rings] Don't answer it, Jack. You know, this is our weekend. You know, no phones, no beeper, no TV. Just the two of us. Don't answer it. Right. It's good, thanks. [phone rings] What if it's your mother? I'll call her back Monday. Good. [phone rings] Don't answer it. I gotta get it. Don't answer it, Jack! Stop! [sighs] JACK: Yeah? I'll be right there. Who was it, Jack? I gotta go down to the station for about an hour. But, uh, I'll come right back, then we'll spend the whole rest of the weekend together. All right? Dorothy, you can't be upset. It's work. I'm not upset with you, Jack. Are you kidding? I don't mind if you go. I really don't. Don't be late. Now, hurry back, OK? - Hm. Thanks. Oh! You want mad? I'll give you mad. Hey, Jack. Duck. [squeaks toy] BARRETT: Uh, it's been brought to my attention, Mr. Saxon, that there's some information that you refuse to divulge to us. What, are you making some kind of accusation Miss Barrett? CAPTAIN BROWN: Jack, can't you answer a simple question? Back off, Captain. We're on the same side here. If you have something, anything at all, please give it to us. Well, I know what you think of us, Jack. Us FBI people in our polyester suits. Kind of tight [muted]. Is that what you think of me, Jack? Basically, yeah. I mean, we do twice the work, you get twice the pay and all the credit. Would you like me to apologize to you for that? Jack. If you don't come up with an answer-- What are you going to do, Captain? You gonna take away another four weeks of my pay? He's not gonna take anything away from you. You're back on payroll. Now, sit down, please. I want you to help us crack this case. If you do, I promise you a promotion and a month's vacation. Hey, you're not authorized to do-- Stop it! Do we have a deal? Deal. I'd also like David here to be your new partner. Well, I already have a partner. Oh, Detective White had a very stressful evening last evening. I think you should take a week or two off. Wait a second. You want time off, Bert? No. I'm fine. He's fine. He's my partner. All right. Go to work. Thank you. [gunshots] What's the matter with you? You're gonna have me killed! I aimed at the bottles. I didn't aim at you, Jack. If we're still gonna be fighting buddies, we better trust each other. Give me the gun. Crazy son of a [muted]. Jesus, Miller, put the bottles down. Shoot 'em, Jack. I'm not shooting bottles out of your hand, man. I trust you're a good shot. Now, trust yourself for a change. Shoot the [muted] bottles out of my hand. How the hell did you ever get past the medical examiner, huh? The craziest [muted] I ever met. Shoot the bottles out of my hand, soldier! That's an order! No! You ain't got no guts, do you? You're not one of those fags who's gonna freak out on me the next time you're in battle, are you, and shoot your fellow soldier? Are you, Jack? Bottles up. Come on, put 'em up. [gunshots] Ow! [gunshots] Jesus, I love it! Whoa! [gunshots] You shot me. You shot me. Son of a [muted]. I'm sorry. You are? [laughs] Son of a [muted]. Damn you! [gunshots] Am I gonna stand here and watch you bat balls all day? Yeah. BERT: You want to talk about it? Talk about what? BERT: About what's eating you, Jack. I think I know who did the printing job. I don't even know where the guy lives. He's an old friend of mine. A long time ago. We were in the war together. Hey, look, Jack, if this guy is a friend of yours, maybe you're too close to go after him. Who's gonna do it? You? Huh? - Yeah, me. What, you don't think I can do it? You're the guy who's telling me you're afraid to pull the trigger. I want some partner who's gonna cover my [muted].. You say you can handle it, huh? Yeah. Yeah, really? Yeah, god [muted] it! Now, put the [muted] damn bat down and let's go after the son of a [muted].. I'll tell you what, all Right if we do this, we do it my way. We don't report to anybody. I trust you, you trust me, but we don't trust anybody else. You got it? All right, great, Jack. Now why don't you tell me who we're looking for? His name's Miller Richardson. He's a little older than I am. Maybe he lives here, or maybe he doesn't. But if he does live here, sooner or later, he's going to turn up in Koreatown. Why Koreatown? Massage parlors. The man loves a massage, but only from Oriental women. Sometimes two and three at a time. Put the bat down, Jack. No bull-[muted]. No bull-[muted]. Let's do it. All right. Good evening, gentlemen. That's $40 for a half an hour. $60 for an hour. And today we have a special where you can get two very lovely ladies for two hours for only $100. Well, that sounds real attractive, but, uh, I'll tell you, we're more interested in a man. Some white guy, 6'4", 220, big jaw. That ring a bell? Look. You want a massage, you give me $100. You want information, go and dial 411. Hey, you guys better get the hell out of here or I'm gonna call the cops. Oh, that's not going to be necessary, sweetie. We are the cops. Put the gun down! I'm a police officer. I said put the gun down. Not one word. You put yours down. Look, I didn't come in here to look and feel. I don't know if you're wanted or not, but you just threatened a police officer. Now, I'm willing to let you walk out of here, OK? I'll forget about it. Just put the gun down. No! Put the gun down! You put your gun down. And then you let me get out of here. OK. OK, nice and easy, huh? You're dead, copper. [gunshot] What the hell's the matter with you, huh? What the [muted] is the matter what you?! Don't you ever, ever give up your gun. You understand? Under any circumstance. You got it? Answer me! Yeah. Now, pick it up. OK, Bryn, let's go. Good. OK, I want you to practice your spins. Great. Bryn, you're getting so much better. Good. Good, good, good. Dorothy, can I speak to you for a sec? Yeah. Hi, Jack. Are you here to skate? Good. Keep going. No. How you doing? Great. How about you? Oh, careful. Isn't she great? Hm. Listen, would you do me a favor? - Mm-hmm. Yeah. Just, uh, take a couple days off. Go stay with Mary or somebody. Why? What's wrong? Nothing's wrong. It's just, uh, I'm not going to be home too much, and, uh, I worry about you. Oh, Jack, I'm fine. Don't worry. Dorothy, just do it. All right? Oh. OK, you want me to quit my job and go into hiding because of your job, right? What is it with you, huh? You've gotta argue with me about everything, don't you? I mean, you missed your calling in life. You should have been a damn attorney, not a teacher. Hey, watch your mouth. I mean, how do you want me to put it? You know, these kids are important to me, and my job is important to me. And you want me to give them both up. No, I don't want you to give anything up. I just, uh-- I want you to be careful. Hey. Just be careful, all right? Listen, how's this. Uh-- what if I get a cop to stay with you, all right? I already have a cop staying with me. You're tough, aren't you? You like being tough, don't you? You're damn right I do. There's a kid here, hmm. You watch your mouth. DR. BALDWIN: How can I help you, Detective? Look, this is probably, uh, one of the strangest things you're ever going to hear. Uh-- I wouldn't be too sure of that if I were you. I've heard some pretty strange things in my life. Yeah? Good, good. Um-- Look, about 18 years ago, I was in Vietnam, all right? And I'm shooting the breeze with a friend of mine, and he's talking about his mother marrying this guy named Fred. Now, I know it's Fred because, uh, he referred to him as Flintstone. But for the life of me, I can't remember his last name, which I think started with an F. [sighs] Jack Saxon visited Dr. Baldwin. He got a name from her. Kate Richards. It seems that Kate has a daughter in Detroit, and a son out here. His name is Miller Richards, or otherwise known as MR. He served in Nam. Got an honorable discharge. No criminal record. No job. No address. No bank account. No utility bill of any kind anywhere in the USA. That's it. Did you put out an APB on him? Yes. Extra security at the airports? - Yes. - All right. What about the money? Nothing. We're monitoring every casino in Vegas, Atlantic City. Every racetrack. Nothing so far. We're getting real close, David. We'll get them. Keep an eye on Saxon. OK. Kate? Kate Richardson? Yes? Uh, you don't remember me, do you? Jack Saxon. I'm Miller's friend. Jack Saxon. Jack! Of course. Oh, how are you? I'm-- I'm fine. I'm fine. How are you doing? Oh, how long has it been? Well, gosh, I guess about 15 years. So what, you finally gave up and decided to move to sunny California? Finally. Oh, I've been here nine years. Have you seen Miller? No, is he in? Oh, no. He-- he doesn't come here often. Once a month, maybe. Well, how's he doing? Oh, doing well. Import, export. Always on the run. One day in France, another in Tokyo. You know Miller. Oh, he's a good man, Jack. He takes good care of me. Well, you wouldn't happen to have a number on him, would you? Oh, I sure wouldn't. But how about you? How have you been doing? Well, believe it or not, I work for the police department. You're a cop? Yes, ma'am, I am. I am a cop. Ah, and any wife and kids? No, no, not yet. No? Oh, goodness. A man like yourself. How did you manage that? Oh, listen to me talking 100 miles an hour. Would you like to sit down? Let me get you something to drink. No, that's all right. I gotta go. Listen, if you see Miller, will you give this to him, Kate? Tell him I'm looking for him? I sure will. It's good to see you. Yes. What are you growing? Uh, flowers. Flowers. OK, you take care. [gun cocks] [gunshots] I'm gonna do you right, Dink. No, no. Don't do it. Let him live, Miller. MILLER: No, Jack. Let him live. Aye, aye, cap. You didn't think I'd leave you here to die, did you, Jack? [phone ringing] JUDY (ON PHONE): Massage parlor. JACK: Yeah, Barbara? No, Judy. Judy, Judy, how are you? Listen, uh, MR and I can't make it down there tonight, so we're thinking maybe, uh, you could send a couple of girls to his place. JUDY (ON PHONE): I don't know an MR. All right, thank you very much. Barbara? GERRI (ON PHONE): No, this is Gerri. Right, Gerri. Listen, uh, I'm calling for Miller Richardson. GERRI (ON PHONE): Who? JACK: MR, Miller Richardson. The big guy, 6'4". Crazy in love. WOMAN (ON PHONE): I don't know any Miller. WOMAN (ON PHONE): I don't know any Miller Richardson. I don't think so. Thank you. Barbara? APRIL (ON PHONE): This is April. JACK: Miller Richardson, MR. APRIL (ON PHONE): Who? SABRINA (ON PHONE): Massage parlor. Yeah, Barbara? SABRINA (ON PHONE): No, Sabrina. I don't know any Miller. I didn't think so. Thank you. [footsteps approaching] You got change for a buck? MAN: What do I look like, a bank? Barbara? JACKIE (ON PHONE): No, Jackie. Jackie, Jackie. Uh, listen, MR and I can't make it in tonight, so we'd appreciate it if you sent a couple of girls to his house. JACKIE (ON PHONE): The same two girls you had last week? Uh, yes, same two would be fine. JACKIE (ON PHONE): Tell MR Veronica and Claudette will be over in half an hour. Oh, no, no, no. We'll send a limo. We'll be there in a half an hour. JACKIE (ON PHONE): We'll be waiting. Thank you very much. Yes! Ladies, ladies. Are you ready? Where's the limo? Ah, the limo. Well, it's in the shop. What's the matter, you don't like this car? No, oh my god, I love it. It's beautiful. Well, oh my god, why don't you drive? Drive? Great. Miller's mansion, right? - Please. Let's go. [doorbell rings] Hi, Mario. Claudette. What are you doing here? MR sent for us. - All right. - What's going on here? MARIO: Hey, boss, the broads are here. Come on in, girls. Who brought you here? Jack. J-- Jack! I don't believe it! How the hell are you? I'm all right, Miller. It's good to see you. You know, my mother warned me about guys like you. You think we could have a couple of minutes alone? Sure. Sure. Mario, take the girls upstairs, will you? I'll be up in a minute. MARIO: OK, boss. Right this way, ladies. It's a hell of a place you got. Thank you. It took a lot of work, but it's home. And I see you finally made detective. Oh, yeah. And you're the one who did the warehouse, aren't you? Yeah. You son of a [muted], Miller. So what, you're going into the printing business now? No, no, no. It was a one-time deal, Jack. It was Fazio's. It was done out of Chicago. Ah. Well, let me tell you something, friend. I'll be glad to take care of Fazio. But tomorrow morning, you gotta turn in the counterfeit money and the plates, and get the hell out of here. Get the hell out and go where, Jack? I don't care. Leave the country, but get the hell out of here. Miller, I owe you. And now we're even. That's right. I almost forgot. You do owe the sarge one, don't you? But you seem to be forgetting one thing here. You seem to be forgetting the rules. And you're on my turf now, Jack. And I'll tell you what I'm going to do for you. Damn it, Miller, I'm not negotiating. Tonight, I came here as a friend. Tomorrow, I'm coming back as a cop. All right? So long, Jack. So long, Miller. [phone rings] Yes? Yeah, Saxon here. Jack. You're walking on thin ice. Now, you give me something. - All right. Um, Fazio Magaleni. It was his printing business. He's either in Miami or Chicago. You should pick him up. Who hid him? JACK (ON PHONE): Well, I'll let you know tomorrow. Come on, Jack. Give me more. Tomorrow. Fair enough. OK. [dial tone beeping] Dorothy? Dorothy? Who are you? Jack Saxon. I was told to meet somebody here. You alone? I'm alone. Enjoy your work? Yeah. Let's go. Where to? You'll find out when we get there. Well, I got a-- I got a problem with flying. You got a problem with living? [jack chuckles] [helicopter whirring] [dramatic marching music] [birds chirping] Miller! [grunting] [grunts] At last we meet again. You sick son of a [muted]. Where is she? She's all tied up, Jack. [laughing] God, you've gone too far. You're over the edge. Perhaps a little too far, Jack, but I am living life to the fullest. Give her back to me, Miller. You want her back, Jack? I want her back. Then come and get her, soldier. Jesus, Miller. [yells] [gunshot] You all right, Jack? Just get the son of a bitch, Bert. Get him! I got him, partner. [muffled yell] [crying] Jack! Hurry! [crying] [yells] [helicopter whirring] [missile firing] [explosion bangs] [explosion bangs] [missile firing] [explosion bangs] [missile firing] [explosion bangs] [missile firing] [explosion bangs] [explosion bangs] [crying] [missile firing] [explosion bangs] JACK: That's right, turn. That's right, baby. Come right in. Yes. Yes. Yes. [explosion bangs] Bingo. Yeah! Son of a [muted]! Bert. Jack. All right, Bert. - Jack, get it out. - No. Get it out, please, Jack! REPORTER: Miss Barrett, what do you have for us today? REPORTER: Have you made any arrests yet, Miss Barrett? Fazio and his men have all been arrested in Miami. This puts an end to the counterfeit conspiracy case. REPORTER: What does that mean? REPORTER: What about the LAPD, Miss Barrett? Were they present at the arrest? REPORTER: And what about Detective Jack Saxon? Was he involved in the arrest of Fazio? In federal cases such as this, we don't involve the local police. We use special unit agents, and they are the ones who made the arrest. BERT: I did it, Jack. I shot him. JACK: I know you did, partner. You done good. I'll tell you what. You go to the hospital, get sewed up, and then I'm going to take you out and buy you the thickest, juiciness New York steak this side of [inaudible].. [music playing]
