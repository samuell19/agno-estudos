MOSES WITHOUT ROD Halt! It is forbidden to whistle in Kurdish. Halt! It is forbidden to whistle in Kurdish. Halt! It is forbidden to whistle in Kurdish. Halt! It is forbidden to whistle in Kurdish. Halt! It is forbidden to whistle in Kurdish. In 1943, I was the principal of Dicle Student Dormitory in Istanbul. One day two policemen took me to the 1st Police Department. As soon as we entered, four-five officers and the police captain attacked me. They hit me, kicked me and insulted me over and over again. I asked why. "You fucking traitor!" said the captain. "Don?t you know your misdeed?" "No," I said. "Haven?t you got a radio?" asked the captain. I said "Yes, we have." "And haven?t you got a phonograph?" I said, "Yes, we have one." "You fucking bastard!" said the captain. "There are so many nice records in Turkish. Why the hell do you whistle in Kurdish at the dormitory?" Mother Father Child My dear father... Once again, times bring yearning and sorrow for us. You had just been released from Diyarbakir Prison. I was delighted when you said to me "Bring my grandchildren over here for a few nights." It meant that I could rest for a few days while you?d be spending time together. However father, this happiness only lasted a single day. A day later, the ruthless came to take you away. Since I was alone, you took the kids home by taxi, I was told. You were accompanied by soldiers... My helper opened the door. I was so devastated, father. I was so devastated for not being able to see you off to our absence. I had come home in a panic. Time seemed to have stopped while I was waiting for my mother. For she was the one who would know best where to look for you. It took us a few days to find out that you were taken to the ?Pavilion? in Erenk?y. Only a few times in my life had I seen my mother cry so much... Because everybody knew what a torture chamber the Pavilion was. My dear father, I heard that visits are not allowed at the Pavilion. Whereas I was hoping that my letter would reach you, I learned that letters are not allowed, either. Dearest father, I miss you very much. My precious father, I am sending you much love. Son, what is that? It is a very good partridge, father. Where does its goodness come from? Father! I will take it up to the mountains. I will put up traps around it. When it calls, other partridges will come and fall into my trap. Why did you let my partridge go? My son! No matter it is an animal or a human being, he who betrays his herd shall be punished. Now, let?s suppose that we, the Kurds, would like to separate from Turkey. So Kurdistan would be robbed, all the remaining balance would be transferred. All of the aboveground and underground resources would be turned into investments here. But how can I give up on my beautiful Istanbul, Izmir, Antalya? How can I leave Adana, Mersin, Bursa and Konya to Turks? What am I to do with Semdinli, Mardin, Siirt? We do not support such separatism. We really do not. I do not say this out of fear or some influence. Kurds do not want to separate from Turks. Look, I am a writer. I write that we are not separatists. And I am tried in court for this same article. Accused of separatism! We are NOT separatists, no! We are not separatists. Sun Moon Sky Today?s youth does not know what a long way we have come. In April, when lovers stroll around arm in arm with their beloved... how could they imagine the cold in January? So, this is where we are coming from, precious Turkish and Kurdish youngsters. What is Mem ? Z?n? Where does it come from? Let us make a brief introduction. The origins of Mem ? Z?n are found in Mem? Alan, a mythological Kurdish saga dating from B.C. Inspired by this saga, the great Kurdish poet Ehmed? Xan? wrote Mem ? Z?n... within the rationale of his era. And it is still beneficial to us today. It inspires us. Mountain Prairie Highland So mister... You intend to divide the country I understand? Your Honour, is the country a meatball so I shall divide? Earth Tree Water How curious are God?s wonders! Who knows why in this crazy country of ours Kurds have been deprived Altogether confined Only if we had a monarch Upon his head a crown bestowed by God And a throne to him assigned Then we too would have some luck So if he had a crown Most certainly we would be well-known It would take away our suffering Save us orphans from the wicked Turks could not defeat us then No more would we live In a ruined owls? land Taking the sword of will in hand Capturing bravely countries of one?s own Only if we were united And we altogether accepted Ottomans, Arabs and Persians Would all be our servants We?d be through with both religion and state matters We?d study both sciences and wonders. My father was a very brave man. He was an idealist and very brave. He never compromised. He always stood by the righteous. He absolutely refused injustice. These qualities made him Musa Anter. A great resistance and power for struggle... He did not tell me to do things, he showed them to me with his living. A great love and respect for life. And the struggle. If one realizes these things in his life... and I saw my father do it... Perhaps that?s why we have such love and respect for life... and we struggle more than others. We will keep on fighting until we die. We are trying to walk in my father?s footsteps in the struggle... although we can never be like him. At least we are trying to be worthy of him. What are you staring at, lady? Look on the ground. Why shall I look on the ground? It is man who was created from earth. You look on the ground yourself. We, women, were made of the rib of man! Certainly we have the right to look at you. Stone Steep Rock Who? Huseyn and the governor of Nis?b?n spread a rumour about me. They made it up themselves. They said "We asked Musa Anter what we should do after retirement. And he suggested we open a brothel in Ciz?r." Of course I did not say anything like that, they made it up. I said "If you will be the director of the brothel, then we will come." Then he said "You should bring your wives first." The governor of Nis?b?n, Atilla Ko?, heard this. He, too, liked jokes. So the governor was supposed to cut the ribbon. At the opening! And the first customers would be given to their wives. But their wives are not worth a penny. Such big money, a penny! His child?s name was Toto... He had a wife and a child. He kidnapped a young girl to marry. Ali, come on now. What is the bet? Let?s say, two roosters. You see this ring? My grandfather defeated your grandfather with this ring. Come on, find it now. You have it. Are you sure? Yes. Am I loaded or am I empty? You are empty. Now you are in trouble! It will be just like the theatre! The penalty... The penalty is money for a bottle of whiskey. Fine, father. I have no choice. Maybe otherwise it will be double! This was for the article. The other is bribe money. Imagine, "he gets caught being bribed." Black as night. A ball of fire... He can?t approach anyone. He walks towards a girl. And he does like this with his foot... The ribab plays. He dances and sings. "Oh boy, what a beautiful piece!", he says. The girl does not understand his words. What did I say? Damn on you! Do you understand? He said that out of manners. He had not spoken yet. He already asks "Do you understand?" He says, "Do I make sense?" And then he says, "Do you understand?" He had not started yet! We had a friend, Azmi G?ldogan. He was a lawyer. In Diyarbakir. Our maths teacher was Celil. In maths lesson... He was cruel. Everybody feared him. Nazmi goes up to the blackboard. He says, "I know nothing." As soon as he says "Secondly...", he gets a slap in the face. "You have to say a first thing, and then you go on with the second! But you say "secondly" before starting off with the first thing!" I have a typewriter. It is just like Rezzak?s taxi. Trrock! Trrock! One button here one button there, they hit one after another. We did not have much possession during the time we were together. After all, we were together only for a very short period of time. It is like me and your mother one of these days... Bernard Shaw. An English lady, very pretty. Bernard Shaw said to himself, "She is another like me." One day she said... "Your Excellency, why don?t you marry me?" Do you understand? And she goes on... "Why shall you marry me?" "Think about it. If we have a child... he or she will be as beautiful as I am and as intelligent as you are. A wonderful child!" He said, "What if it turns out just the opposite?" Life Death Universe At a mountain, Uncle did I arrive Those poor mountains! Almost did they cry Barley had come into ear So small was the wheat Then came the pests, Uncle Flocks of them, alas! Ate away our wheat, Uncle Left behind the hay, alas! Then came the pests, Uncle Off the highlands they forged Ate away the poor?s wheat, Uncle The sun was high in the sky dearest Uncle Towards milking time The herd flowed down, Uncle Down to the shepherds, alas! Four crippled calves remained behind, Uncle Mouths on the udder, alas! Do not grieve, sister! Soon will come your brothers and sisters to rescue you from being eaten up. Soon will come your brothers and sisters to rescue you from being eaten up. Soon will come your brothers and sisters to rescue you from being eaten up. Musa Anter! Are you of Armenian origin? No, I am of Kurdish origin. However, we are united with Armenians by calamity. Pain Laugh Falcon Night Red Tree Will Time Eye Sword Intelligent Blind Sound Four Salt Hair Black Prairie Deaf One Head, blood Mute, mourning, star River, life, soul My father gave me truly great advice. We got on really well. We were like friends. There was one thing he told me every time I would leave. He would repeat... "Let us even hear your death and bring honour upon us... but never take a penny from anyone." "There is one more thing I ask of you. Whatever they menace you with,.. whatever threats they make,.. do not ever compromise your character and do not lie." He said "I stopped after having three children. Only if I knew! I would have had hundreds of children. But thank God, I have millions of daughters and sons today." I am his biological son. We did not really have a father-son relationship. He was rather my idol. Very much like Che, as I was growing up. Later, Ap? Musa became my idol. He was not at all like a father to me. Believe me, I did not relate to him as my father. I always tried to follow in his footsteps, to do like he did, live like he lived... ...and help others. At this age, I have still not even been served a glass of water by anyone. We are rather used to always give ourselves. I tell the judges that they, too, should be on my side. Those merciless! What kind of law is this? Who made these laws? Like that Italian, what was his name? Beccaria... Beccaria said... "I am astonished. The judges, before everyone else, should be revolting against these laws." What did I say to... Heaven Purgatory Hell We have been ruined. But we will be ruined no more! We have been ruined. We have been ruined. We have been ruined. But we will be ruined no more! We have been ruined. But we will be ruined no more! We have been ruined. But we will be ruined no more! Musa Anter Musa Anter Musa Anter Musa Anter Musa Anter I have been a sworn and living witness to all of Turkey?s account for 55 years. And not only a witness. No! I am a defendant. I am a convict. And I am a petitioner against it! Once upon a time, rats invaded a country. They ate away whatever they found, wheat and all crops... Somebody came forward and said "I can destroy these rats." "Get me a big iron cage." "Everybody shall catch the rats alive." "We will shut them in the cage alive." So they build a cage with bars closely wrought. They catch thousands of rats alive and confine them in the cage. A few days later, the rats begin to get hungry. They start eating each other. First they eat the small and the sick. There are less and less rats left. They are given a little food now and then. The rats snap up the food. But after a while, they stop eating the food given to them. And yet, when a dead rat is given to them as food, they rush to devour it. When people see that rats are now used to eating the flesh of their own kind,.. they open the door of the cage. Of thousands of rats, there are only 40-50 left now. But they have the habit of cats. They disperse all over the city. The rats in the streets do not flee them. They consider them rats. They do not know that these are rats in appearance and cats in habit! The rats eat all the other rats they come across. And thus were all the rats in the country eradicated. Kurdish is forbidden! The charge is 5 Turkish liras per word! I am me. You are you. Dogs bark in the direction they fear. Trees grow on their own roots, people blossom on their own language. A lion is a lion, whether it is male or female. Long live freedom! For Musa Anter...
