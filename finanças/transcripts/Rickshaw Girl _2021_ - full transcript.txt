[music] [sound of birds and monks chanting] [peaceful music] [music fades out, children singing in the background] Are you done? Almost done. Oi, that way. Hurry up, you're not done already? How long does it take? Hurry up. Okay. The guests will be arriving before evening. Did you call Auntie? You should call. [men continue arguing in Bengali] What's going on? Where is the rest of the yogurt? Go get it! Why are you standing here for? I won't pay a single taka if you don't finish it by this evening. Stupid people. [cheerful music from the other room] The yogurt is coming? On the way. Check it, Chairman is very angry. Okay. You have my phone number? Call me, okay? What's this? I will make it 50 taka, take it or leave it. Chacha, you said you'd pay me 200. You gave 200 to the other girl. This is very unfair. Are you arguing with me? I will tell your father. Go tell him, he'll be proud. Oi, What's the problem? Chairman, sir, Mamun is not giving me the money I was promised. You tell me, is this justice? Mamun where did you get this troublemaker from? Clear up this matter. Here's another 50, now go, before I hit you. 200 Taka, I'm not leaving. Out! No more arguments. Now get out! [man talks on the phone] [men greet each other in Bengali] [men continue talking in Bengali] [man yells at the girl] Hey girl, what are you doing? Someone catch her! [men yelling in Bengali] [men yells at the girl] [Bollywood music] [music intensifies] [pop music playing in the background] You here again? Go! I'll take a pan. [kids talk in the background] - [woman in Bengali] - I know you will. [woman talking in Bengali] How was the groom? Like a monkey. Ama, they were supposed to give me 200, but they only gave me 100. Be happy with it. Look at your clothes. Go to the pond, take a shower. [mysterious music] [singing starts] [music fades out, the sound of train from afar] What happened to him? Do you know him? He's my father. Aba? Aba, what happened? Aba, get up. Yes. Slowly, slowly. Just watch. - It's okay, just the sun. Go home, I am coming. - No, no, baba, you sit back, I'll take you home. Aba, sit back. Go slowly. Aba, do you want to pull up the hood? No need, Naima. Sun is almost down. [talking in Bengali] Papa, today I painted a very big painting. When my passengers see your painting, they say, how beautiful. I feel proud of that. Don't give up painting. Don't worry, Aba, I will never give up painting. These pictures are very special for me. It feels like it is a part of our family. [Aba coughing] [sad music] Aba's been sick for a while. When do you plan to take him to the hospital? Should we just let him die then? [calm music] [music swells with orchestra] [calm night with insects in the background] [orchestra music] [singing starts] [speaking in foreign language] [young man replies in foreign language] Barek! Get up! Go get my breakfast! [two men arguing in Bengali outside] [men continue to argue intensely] [argument continues] Barek. Barek. Boo! Hey, wait! I have to talk to you. How do you live with that scoundrel uncle of yours? Did you know he tried to cheat me out of my money? Where else would I go? I curse my parents for passing away and leaving me in this hell. What's this? Uncle's breakfast. Hey Naima, my uncle will kill me. Give him this. He doesn't have to eat parathas every day. Naima, give me the breakfast! Naima, I'm telling you! Give me the breakfast! Naima! Hey, Naima! Naima, give it to me. Give it to me! Hey Barek, how do you call the passengers to your bus? Dhaka! Dhaka! Dhaka! - Naima, stop! Naima, stop! Naima, give it to me! Naima, please, stop! Naima, give it to me! Give it to me! Naima! Naima, please, stop! [emotional music] Give the prescription to the compounder. He will tell you where to buy it from. How long must he take it? Forever. Better? How much money it will cost? I'm not sure, but I think you need a good amount of money. Please, go out. He will tell you where to go. [sending-off in Bengali] [background chatter in Bengali] [Aba coughing] What took you so long? Take your father home. I am already late for work, go. Let's go. Let's go. What was the doctor saying? I don't know. [Aba coughing] Aba, how far can you go with one pedal? You see, you have to place your left leg on the pedal and climb on the seat. Then you have to pedal out, slowly to move forward. Pedal up to four or five times, then sit back to this. Selim didn't go for work? Get your father. He's sleeping, he's not doing well. Call him, and tell him that I have come. Salim? Salim? Why is the rickshaw here? Why aren't you out for work? Have you earned enough yesterday? Just leaving, Mamun. Please, come in. If you don't pay this month, I'm taking the rickshaw away. A few more days, please Mamun, I will pay you. Are you made of excuses? Can't you see he's not doing well? Hey, Naima, go inside. Naima, come inside. Come. No, no hanky panky. I want my money back within a week. Do you get paid for all this? Why would I? Your uncle is an ass. I know. Sometimes I want to escape this place. You're so lucky, you get to go to Dhaka every single day. Move. Dhaka has everything. Dhaka is the city of money. Money is in the air. Why don't you go then? I thought of leaving this place. This place holds me back. I feel like I'll be all alone. Take me along. What? It's very difficult to survive in Dhaka. And Dhaka is not safe for girls. Look, I think it's better if you don't go to Dhaka. You know what? It might be a very good choice for you, if you find a job in the garment factory. Doesn't Siam live in Dhaka? All the actors and actresses, they all live in Dhaka. Hey? Do you think Mamun will really take our rickshaw? What do you think? Sister, what are you doing here? You look hungry, did you eat anything all day? Are you upset, sister? Sometimes I think there's no place for me in this world. Nonsense, you're my hero. Then you need better heroes. Apa, I will get a job in the garment factory. Absolutely not. You're supposed to be concentrating on your studies right now. Promise me. Promise. Remember the lotus robin, and snaky roads you drew on my notebook? My teacher saw it and appreciated it a lot. He thought I drew it. Later, I told him it was you. School is just not for me. You see that boat over there? Yes. You know, I drew that. Father, how are you doing today? Ama, I'm hungry. The doctor said everything will be fine. Ama you're home? Did they let you go today? Ama, did you buy the medicine? Ama? Madame accused me of stealing a mobile phone. She did not pay me. She said she will call the police. Did she call you a thief? Ama wait, let's go. I'm gonna beat the shit out of that woman. What do you think you are? You cannot even pass fifth grade. If you had the ability, then go. Buy your father's medicine. Your stupid painting cannot bring money for us. [sad music] [Naima sobbing] Mamun bhai, please Mamun bhai, give me to two days more. I'll get you the money. Hey, where are you taking my rickshaw? Let go. Mamun, bhai please, give me two days more. Shut up. You'll be dead in two days. Wait, let it go. Let go, my rickshaw. Hey! How can you do this? Can't you see my father's sick? Don't talk, it's my money. Let's go. [men yells as they run away] [woodwind music] Take it and sell it tomorrow. Do we have any other choice? [slow string music] Pabna! Sirajgonj! Dhaka! [repeatedly] [shouting the bus route in Bengali] [continues shouting the bus route in Bengali] Where are you going? Dhaka. What do you mean by Dhaka? Naima, go home. Go home. Are you crazy? What are you going to do in Dhaka? I will work. Who will give you work? You. [man talk loudly in Bengali] [conductor yells] [sound of traffic] [conductor yells in Bengali] [conductor talks in Bengali] I spoke to Mina Khala. She will give you work. Where? Let's go, I will drop you there. Okay. [loud street noise] Naima, come. [doorbell rings] [sound of TV from inside the room] [man and woman greet each other in Bengali] What's your name? Naima. Do you know how to cook? Yes. Okay. You sit there. I'll take you home after my work, it's going to be late. - As-salamu'alaykum -Wa-alaykum salam [Islamic greeting] [TV dialogue in the background] My trip will start now. Mina Khala is a very nice person. Anything you need, just give me a call, okay? Okay. You still have time. If you want to go back home, I can take you. No, I'll be fine. [melancholic guitar music] Come. [talking in Bengali] Hello? Yes, yes. This girl is from my village. You are at home, right? Okay, okay. I'm coming within an hour. [doorbell rings] Come, come. Just give me a minute. Open your sandal and come. Come inside. Sit here. Your husband is home, right? Yeah, he's home. What's your name? She's Naima. Nice name. Did you go to school? Up to class five. So, she's gonna stay here, and you will cook and clean. Are you hungry? There's food in the fridge. That's your room. Get some rest, I will show you everything in the morning. Tell me one thing. What does Aisha know about stock market? Shut up, Asif. My god, we'll be late again. We're going to Aisha's party tonight, right? We are, but we have a new maid. I don't think we can be so late tonight. So what? Just lock her up, she'll be fine. Naima, clean it up. Yes. Honey, I'm leaving. So, I'll pick you up at 7:30? Yeah. Okay, take care. Bye. See you soon. See you. Naima, we'll be late tonight, but if you face any problem, you can call the manager. [elevator bell dings] [mysterious string music] [Islamic call to prayer from the outside] - [Alexa Speaker] I'm having trouble connecting to the internet. Take a look at the help section. I'm having trouble connecting to the internet. Take a look at the help section. [bird chirping] [nostalgic sad music] That's why I don't like it. She doesn't have any sense of time or anything. I told you to leave it- Stop blaming me. Why you are lying on the floor? But you never listen. Go, lock the door. Oh, man. Naima! Naima, where are you? [exciting music] [tense music] [music becomes more rhythmic] [crowd chanting] [crowd yells] [indistinct shouting] - Wait! - Don't stop, just run! Why are we running? Because you don't want to get caught by the cops, do you? [music fades out] Now what? You guys wait here, I'll get the money. Excuse me. - As-salamu alaykum - Wa-alaykum salam [chatter in Bengali] [chatter in Bengali] This is yours. Why? This is your payment. Why did they pay us? If you walk in demonstration they give you 100 taka, and if you get involved in a fight, they pay you 200 taka. But what are we protesting? Who cares? Where are you going? - I don't know. Where are you guys going? Our home. Is this your home? This is all of our many homes. And this is my dining room. [emotional music] This is my bathroom. Hey, you don't wanna eat? [singing in Bengali] - This is what you guys do every day? No, we have different jobs every day. And what if you don't have any job? Then we make our own. Hey! Hey, you kids again. Oh, he's here again. - How dare you! Haven't I told you not to come here? Let's go. If I see you next time, I'll beat you, I swear. This city's full of rotten kids. [slow music] [music continues, inaudible background dialogue] [the kids talking in Bengali] [the kids talk in Bengali] Is this where you guys sleep? Every corner of Dhaka city is our bedroom. [speaking in Bengali] [chatter in Bengali from inside] Get out. You come to work drunk, you think it's a bar? No, it's my garage. Get out, don't come back. Get out! This city full of hungry men, and I can't find a decent puller. [man replies angry in Bengali] Chacha, how much is this rickshaw? Why, want to buy it? No, I want to ride it. Is this a joke? I know how to pull a rickshaw. Where are you from? I'm from Paksey. My father is a rickshaw puller there. You don't believe me? Look, look. Hey, hey, get off, get off, get off now! And get out. [man swears in Bengali] Chacha, my father is very sick. If I can ride the rickshaw, I can send him some money for his treatment. Go get some other job. But I'm the daughter of a rickshaw puller. That's not good enough for pulling rickshaw. Then what do you need to be a rickshaw puller? You need to be a man first. [indistinct dialogue between the men] [melancholic music] [music intensifies] [intense emotional uplifting music] [music fades out] [man grunting] Need help? What do you do? Nothing. Looking for any work. Nah, I can't find anything. Huh? Can't find anything. Come with me, let's find you something. What's your name again? Naim. He's from our village.
