I want to go to Mr. Amarnath's house. Please give me the address. Certainly! Certainly! Are you Mr. Amarnath's relative? - No. - So why are you going there? It's available at my place too. You must have a mirror too? Yes! Surely! Mirror! Mirror! Got scared, dear? These bullets are for firing. Not for shooting. Is this Mr. Amarnath's bungalow? You want to go to his house? Come. I'll take you there. Thanks. But this... Like Amarnath, the people who come to visit him, too, are cowards. What to do? After all it's his second marriage! - Ramu! - Yes, sir. - Take this gun inside. - Okay, sir. Come. God knows when I'll be free! So many times I've told you to hire a servant. I have too many things to do. I've told all my acquaintances. We'll find a servant in a day or two. We'll see when we get one. For the moment, I'm the servant. Munni! - Is lndu still asleep? - No. Shall I go and awaken her? Wait! I'll go myself. What's going on? Munni! Come, colonel. Have a seat. - What has brought you here? - Come, dear. - She seems to be lndu's friend. - I... - Dear, have tea. - Yes. Drink it. Don't feel shy. Colonel, why are you here so early in the morning? I thought you don't invite me for tea. So today I will go and have it myself. Wife, he has come to drop lndu's friend. I... Dear, first eat. You can talk later. She won't feed you everyday. Eat. Okay. I'll leave now. - Today, I have to go to take my pension. - Oh! Attention! Salute! You will be ready! Have a biscuit! - Bye! - But... - Friend? - No. I... Look, my name is Shama. Mr. Ratanlal has sent me here for a job. - For a job? - Yes! You didn't give me a chance to talk. We don't have any work for such a fashionable servant. I am not like this. I will do whatever you say. What will you do? You have come for a job. And you're eating in our presence. We don't need you. Strange. They need her yet they're saying no. - Right, Pappu? - Yes! Look, will you work? Why not? That's why I have come. So your job is confirmed. Right, Pappu? You kids keep quiet. You come with me. Fine. I'll give you the job. Your salary will be 40 rupees. What will I have to do? The usual household chores. Cooking, washing dishes, sweeping... buying groceries at the market. After that you can relax. I thought I'd have to do other chores. Like looking after the kids, their studies. You can teach too? You'll get 25-30 rupees more. Okay. I accept. Tell me. Where will you live? I've made my own arrangements. Very good. Start cooking. 'My dear sister. Kiran. I have got a job.' 'I am sending you money. Now you'll be able to study.' 'This was mother's desire too.' 'That you become an educated woman.' 'I hope you are doing well in college.' I wish... I too could wear such saris... such jewelry. Jeetu! - What are you doing here? - Rajendra, why did you come here? Look, here my name is not Jeetu. It's Ajit. I know. You still haven't given up your old habits. You must have come here searching for prey. Yes. That's true. But look, don't spoil my game. I'll tell you everything some other time. - I see. - Kiran. Ajit, you've come. I've been waiting for you since 3 o'clock. So today, too, you didn't attend classes? I don't like it in college. I just feel like sitting here. Look, that girl is wearing such a beautiful necklace. And she has worn such an expensive sari. I was just about to... Today why are you talking crazily? You'll always consider me crazy. Have you ever tried to understand me? I too feel like wearing good clothes, pearl necklaces. After all, what do these girls have that I don't have? Darling, every person gets a chance. The day will arrive when these girls will look at you wistfully. God knows when that day will be. That day is not far away. We'll get married soon. After that you'll become an affluent man's wife. Then you'll know that our maids wear such clothes. Tell me. What's your home like? Darling, it's not to be heard, it's to be seen. It's not a house. It's a glass palace. You'll feel as if you have entered a new world. A new world? You're so nice, Ajit! The bill? Surely. Wallet! Today I again forgot it at home. I'm so in love I remember nothing besides you. What are you looking at? Give it to madam. Yes. Surely. Breakfast is still not ready. Shama! Shama! Coming. It's 9:30! I told you I wanted breakfast ready at 9:00! From tomorrow on it'll be ready by 9:00. So your salary will also begin tomorrow. - Where is the milk? - I'll just get it. Hurry up! Father. Brother Shyam is arriving today. Who'll go to pick him up at the station? - We all will go, dear. - Yes. He hasn't forgotten his way home. He'll come on his own. - Here. - Where's the butter? Sorry. It won't happen again. What do I care? Every day break a vessel. I'll deduct it from your salary. Go and get another vessel from the market. God, do hear me. Get me married. Get me married once, God. For the past eight years I've been worshipping You. - Won't You heed me, God? - Listen! My God heard my prayer! I knew you'd come again. How did you know I'd return? That day I offered you a job. And you refused. But my master says that a woman's no means yes. Don't talk too much. I want a vessel for milk. - Here. - What's the price? - Price? Just take it. - What's the price? - Two paisa for you. - Why two paisa for me? The price varies with the customer. Again the same nonsense. What's the real price? The real price is one rupee. Do you see this, God? What Your devotees are going through? What was this? It was a vessel. Now its just pieces. Pardon me. I didn't break it deliberately. - You can take its cost from me. - What will I do with the money? Can you pay for the abuses which madam will shower on me? If you say, I will hear your madam's abuses. And if you say, I'll buy a new vessel. Listen. Run and buy a milk vessel from the shop. Instead of standing here silently why don't we converse? I don't need to converse with you. I don't know you. You're standing quietly. Something is going on I guess this is the first time you're meeting each other You're standing quietly. Something is going on I guess this is the first time you're meeting each other When she got annoyed at her lover... the darkness from her hair travelled to her face Just a moment a ago it was day, and now it is night I guess this is the first time you're meeting each other You're standing quietly. Something is going on I guess this is the first time you're meeting each other With first meetings, such things can happen The boy lost himself in the girl and vice versa The funny thing is that neither one was aware of this I guess this is the first time you're meeting each other You're standing quietly. Something is going on I guess this is the first time you're meeting each other Very good! Very good! Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! What a song! Right? - Give me, sir! My reward. - Oh! A penny was left. You can have it. I earned it. I sang a priceless song. Here is the vessel, sir. Carefully. I don't have any money left. You should be ashamed. Me? Why? Why are you following me? I feel you're walking ahead of me. Why would I do that? What do you think of yourself? Such a hot temper in this cold weather. If I wasn't in a hurry, I would have taught you a lesson. Munni, Munni! Look, a rogue is following me. A rogue! I'll teach him a lesson! - Who is it? - Munni. He's my brother Shyam! Greetings, mother. Greetings! - Brother! What delicious food! Right, Pappu? - Yes! Yes! The food is delicious! Shyam, your clinic must be doing good business. I shut down the clinic. I didn't like the work. Do you hear this? He's shut down the clinic. He doesn't like the work. Son, why did you give up such a nice profession? Father, in the city people who came to my clinic... they either used to suffer from colds or from headache. Some came for a fake certificate... so they could get off work. But you were concerned just with your fees. You should earn money. And not worry about the source. Mother, I've studied medicine to cure troubled people. Not to earn money. Fine, son. He doesn't need money. He thinks his father is very rich. He'll take as much money as he wants from you. So brother, what will you do after closing your clinic? I'll treat poor people from nearby small villages. Those poor people who can't go to the hospital. Those who don't have money to pay the fees. Instead of charging a fee to cure some rich man's cold... it's better to treat a poor man for free. People only say such things. No one has actually done it. He'll do what nobody has ever done. He wasted 15000 on his studies. He wasted 2000-4000 rupees on his clinic. How will you pay back the money? Slowly he'll earn money. You keep quiet! Your leniency has spoiled him. After wasting 20,000 rupees, he's come home to rest! Mother, why do you talk of money over and over again? Why would you care for money? After all, you've wasted it! We educated you so you could earn a living. And help support us, too. If you provided my education because of greed, you've made a mistake. Yes, son. If you won't call it a mistake, then who else will? Do you know? For your studies my own children suffered so much loss! Indu wanted to study in college. But I stopped her schooling. So that people don't say I behave stepmotherly towards you! Mother! 'Doctor, good that you didn't eat dinner.' 'Food eaten in anger spoils your health.' 'But eat it now. Hot tempered girl.' Shama, today you'll have to sleep on an empty stomach. No problem. He ate. I'll have water. God has created a wonderful thing called water. Water isn't bad. Shama, let this be. It's useless to clean it. I won't stay here. I won't stay in this room. - I won't stay in this house. - But where will you go? Where somebody needs me. Where I can be of use to someone. Shama, thanks a lot for yesterday's dinner. Oh! that? You're embarrassing me over nothing. Shama, you don't know. I appreciate these small things. Last night I felt as if I have a supporter in this house. Shama! Bye. - Yes? - Have you got my things? - What things? - You're asking what things! Yesterday, didn't I tell you to get cream and powder? - I forgot that. - Quickly get it! I'll get it right away. I am still young. Shama! Did you break another vessal? No. Sister lndu wants some things from the shop. Say 'lndu'! Why are you saying 'sister lndu'? I was going to the bungalow. I have heard Shyam has come. Quickly go. He is leaving. Leaving? ls everything okay? Last night there was a quarrel. He must have fought with his mother. The poor guy isn't destined for his parents' love. - Is he really leaving today? - Yes. Dear, you go. You'll be late. Brother Shyam! Brother Shyam! Why are you leaving home? I won't let you go! - Come back! - Munni, don't be stubborn! I have to go. - You go! - Mother, you stop him! If he wants to leave, let him go. He's not giving us any joy by staying here. Father! Son, where are you going? I am going to my friend Dr. Ramesh's house, father. Allow me to leave. Okay, son. God bless you. Shyam sir! Shyam sir! Come with me quickly! - Why? What happened? - It's the colonel, sir! He's called for you. What did you say? The Colonel isn't well? - Yes! Come quickly, Shyam sir! - Okay! Oh my God! Save me! I am dead! I am dead! What happened, colonel sir? I am dying! Shyam! Look, what has happened to me! Don't worry, colonel sir! I'll check! Oh my God! Forgive my sins! This pain will kill me! You seem hale and hearty! So why are you screaming? - Yes, you would say that. - I'll send for medicine for you. Don't send it through somebody. You come yourself and give me the medicine. But... I am leaving, colonel sir. Dear, I am dying and still you'll leave. We have only one doctor here. Milkiram! For pneumonia he says to use ice water! Don't go, dear. If the colonel requests, then stay back, son. Okay, colonel sir. If you say, I will stay back. Yes, dear. Stay back. Now quickly go and get medicine for me. - I'll go right away and be right back. - Colonel, we'll be leaving now. You'll recover. Don't worry. It's so strange, Shama. I was thinking that I might meet you here. And I saw you coming here slowly... like floating clouds. I too was thinking about you. And you came... like Spring in desolation. - Today I should have asked for something else. - What? Nothing. So you're not leaving? I'll have to leave, Shama. I'll leave after the colonel recovers. Okay. I've returned home. You stay here? It's a small house. It's beautiful. I too like small houses, quiet conversation... and being with the people important to me. - Goodbye! - Goodbye! Whether he is near, whether he is far... he always dwells in my eyes Some one tell me... is this love? A trivial matter like love And I can't say that, either He feels shy, and I, too, feel shy Whether he is near, whether he is far... he always dwells in my eyes Some one tell me... is this love? The meeting times are short... and the nights of separation are long While the entire world sleeps... I count the stars Whether he is near, whether he is far... he always dwells in my eyes Some one tell me... is this love? 'Sister, good that you found a job. I need more money.' 'Quickly send it.' Needs more money? But I sent money a few days ago. Kiran, what are you doing there? 'I have lit this lamp of love.' 'In a short while, this lamp has spread light.' 'My and Ajit's love has given me a new life.' 'This beautiful new life.' 'As if I was asleep till now.' 'Now I am waking up.' 'I want the light of our love to always burn.' 'And I always want to dance before my beloved.' 'What happened?' 'Will the lamp of my love also extinguish like this?' 'So what if it goes out?' 'I'm happy the lamp of my love lasted for so long.' Wow! Wow! Tell us. Why have you given this party? I know. For Kiran and Ajit's engagement. I'll be right back. - Greetings. - What is it? I have made so many rounds in the past three months for my rent. Pay it today at least. I'll pay. But not right now. Can't you see? A party is going on. I didn't know that, sir. Repay the full rent amount. Otherwise you'll be humiliated in front of the guests. - Let me tell you! - Lower your voice! Wait! I'll get it! Kiran! - What's the matter, Ajit? - Do you have money? Why do you need it now? The landlord has come! God knows what's happened to the postal service. I haven't received my money. But I don't have a single penny. I spent the tuition money on today's party. Look, Kiran. You can't even give me some money. I can even lay down my life for you! And you aren't helping me in time of need. No, Ajit. You're getting angry unnecessarily. For me, money is not more important than you. But what to do? I'm helpless. I did write to my sister for money. God knows what's happened to her. Don't worry, Ajit. I'll get money in a day or two. Fine! What is sister doing? Press it properly! - I want to say something. - What happened? I needed some money. I see! So now you have needs too? How long have you been on the job? Just a few days. But I need 30 rupees urgently. First, let the month end. Take it then. I don't want to spoil my servants... by giving them advances. - Go and work in the kitchen! - Enough massaging. I am still... - Colonel sir! - Who is it? - Shyam, you! - What are you doing, colonel sir! Yesterday you were so sick. And today you're standing as if nothing happened. Dear, I'll tell you everything. Do you know? I'm an army man. Just... Fees? Dear, you used to say you'd treat your patients for free. Colonel sir, I said it for poor people. I'm not rich either. You know that whatever pension I receive... it's all spent on pipe and tobacco. And dear, 32 rupees is too much. Dr. Milkiram charges only 5 rupees. Yes. And he treats pneumonia with ice water. I see! If you can't charge your uncle a high fee... then whom else will you charge? Thanks, colonel sir! Your ailment came to my good use! Great! I fell sick for your sake! And on top of that I had to pay your fees! Come on my horse! Come on my horse! Tell Shama to iron this coat. It's already been ironed, brother. Tell her to iron it more. Pappu, come here. Shama, brother has given this coat. He said to iron it again. - Iron it more? - Yes. 'Shama, consider this money as your own.' 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70... Colonel sir. Since morning you are counting money. - And your tea is getting cold. - You're concerned about the tea... and there is a shortage of 32 rupees. - 32 rupees! You gave it to him. - Gave it? To whom? Sir, didn't you pay Shyam sir's fees. Yes, Ramu! I had forgotten! I am sick! Ramu, see who has come. Sir, Amarnath's servant has come. - Not servant! Say Shama! Send her in! - Okay! Come, dear. Colonel sir! How are you? I am better now, dear. God bless Shyam. He brought me back from the brink of death. Tell me. Now do fights take place in the house? Quarrels do take place. But Shyam sir has stayed back because of your ailment. He'll leave after you recover. Dear, I can't remain sick all my life. We should find some other solution to stop him. Yes. Otherwise he will leave. So he should stay here? I mean to say... I understood your meaning. What did you understand, colonel sir? Dear, I understood that matter which you can't discuss. No. This is not true. Now I will leave. Goodbye! Dear, where are you going? The door is here. Love is a great thing. Shyam and Shama. Nice pair! But Shyam, you should have taken my blessing! Secretly you fell in love! Come on! Today let me tackle you! - Ramu! - Yes, sir! - Bring Shyam! - Yes, sir! - Sir, Shyam sir is passing by this way. - Is that so? Shyam! Shyam! Colonel sir, what is this? You're running. Why shouldn't I run? Am I afraid of anybody? But colonel sir, running will have an adverse effect on your lungs. Dear, these aren't artificial lungs. It's the real stuff. But till yesterday you were unwell. Who said I was unwell? I played this drama to stop you. Now I don't need to play this drama. Now you'll have to stay back. Now what's the matter, colonel sir? Earlier I was unwell. Now you are unwell. No. I'm fine. You're fine? What about your heart problem? I don't understand, colonel sir! Why do you address me as colonel sir! Call me uncle! Shyam and Shama. Destiny has named you both well. You have held Shama's hand. Don't ever leave it, dear. I am with you! - Who's the letter for? - You. 'I need 100 rupees urgently. Quickly send it.' Kiran, again you want money. From where do I get 100 rupees for you? I must go there and see what you do with the money. That's really good! Who's it from, mummy? Tomorrow Mr. Amritlal is coming here with Sundari. Why is he coming here? He wants to fix Sundari's wedding with Shyam. Mummy, Sundari is so ugly! The lovelier her name the uglier she is. What do we care whether she's ugly or not? We care only about her wealth! But of what use is her wealth to us? Brother Shyam will spend it. Fool, the dowry will come to our house. I'll give Shyam a few clothes and a few ornaments. And I'll keep the rest for you. Mummy, you're so clever. Just see that brother Shyam doesn't refuse. Why do you worry, dear? I'll handle him. Good that colonel fell sick. And Shyam stayed here. Mummy, brother Shyam! Shyam! Come here! Son, it's going to rain. And you're going out. I need some medicine, mother. I'm going to the market. Wait awhile. If you get drenched and catch cold, you'll fall sick. Listen, son. Wow! Don't take that day's discussion seriously. After all, I am your mother. I never felt bad about what you say, mother. I respect you as much as my biological mother. Why not? This is what I expect from you! Listen, son. Don't ever think about leaving the house! If you want, you can open your clinic in a nearby village. I will surely help you in whatever way I can. Yes. Thanks, mother. It doesn't seem to be raining. You're going out, aren't you? - Yes. - Go, son! Go! How was it? Mummy, you're great! How long have you been standing here? - I've come just now. - What do you want? I want a day off to go to the city. I've some very important business. Okay, if you'll return by tomorrow then go. - Return by the first train. - Yes. Okay fine. Look at this. You won't find anything better than this. Look... a cup with a lid. Oh, Shama, come. So how are you? - What is its price? - I told you it costs six rupees and fifty paisa. Tell me, what do you want? Is there another? No madam, I don't want to sell. Greetings. Oil, soap, powder, cream, what do you want? - No Mohan. - Not Mohan, call me Manmohan. I've some important business with you. You have business with me? Really? Tell me. - I need a loan of rupees 100. - Only 100 rupees? You should have asked for 2-4 lakh rupees. You hold this necklace as collateral. Shama, you're hurting my feelings. I'm Manmohan and not any greedy man. Here, take 100 rupees. No, you'll have to keep this chain, or I won't take the money. Okay, give me. - Yes, this is the place. - I want to meet Kiran. - Which Kiran? - The one who studies in college. - How are you related to her? - I'm her elder sister. - Please call her. - I'd call her if she were here. She's gone out with a boy. With a boy? Who is this boy? I don't know. He comes here every other day. He lives in the corner building of that street. Don't go away... Now that we love each other, please don't go away Oh, my heartless beloved Please swear by me that you'll always be mine Don't disclose that we love each other to anyone else From this hostile world... Keep it a secret from this hostile world Oh, my heartless beloved Now that we love each other, please don't go away Oh, my heartless beloved Swear that you won't hurt my delicate feelings Will you desert me and go away? Don't forget me after giving me a place in your heart Oh, my heartless beloved Now that we love each other, please don't go away Oh, my heartless beloved Fantastic! Superb! Carry on. But who are you? And what are you doing here? - Madam, I'm photographing you. - Oh! My snap! Don't you know it's a crime to take someone's picture without permission? Sir, what do I know of crime and punishment? We start our work wherever we see a good scene. We don't want you to take pictures. Go away. But sir, you should keep some memory of the days of love. Don't disappoint the poor fellow. Then you get your picture taken alone. No sir, I don't take a single person's photo. Look at my album. There are only couples. - Okay brother, take the picture of the two of us. - Oh yes. No madam, don't move. The picture will come out blurry. - Ready? - Ready. - Oh no! The lady on the left, please. - Oh, oh! Thank you. Ready? Ready? Oh thank you. Now I'll give you the finished picture in a minute. Here sir, your picture. And give my 12 paisa. Here, boss. Take one rupee. You'll remember that you took a rich man's picture. No sir, this is wrong. I don't take a tip from anyone. - Here, take your 25 paisa. - Thank you. - What a poor picture! - Don't tear it. If you don't like this, then we'll shoot another... snapshot in some big studio this evening. No Kiran, these big photographers shoot the... snaps and paste them outside their shop for exhibition. - So what's the harm? - What if our relatives see it? So what will happen? We have to get married. - Yes. We'll marry, but it's not good to... reveal our romance before marriage. Then what's the hurry? First you complete your studies. It'll take three more years of college now. Why only three years? If you say, I'll wait 300 years for you. Don't joke. You always ignore what I say. You don't understand, Kiran. We need money for the marriage... but where will we get it? I don't know whether father is angry or he has lost... my address, that he isn't sending money. I think I'll ask uncle Colonel. His wealth is lying in the banks... and I don't even have the money to pay rent. I'll get the rent. I've told sister to bring the money. I've brought the money. - You? - Kiran, who is she? - She... she is our maid. - Maid? Yes. Maybe she's brought my sister's message. Sister has sent you here, right? So... is she all right? She is fine. Who is he? What's it to you? He could be anyone. Why have you come here? I've come to see what you're doing here... under the pretence of studying at college. You were sent here to study... and not to flirt with loafers. Kiran, this maid has the nerve to question you? If I were in your place, I'd have pulled out her tongue. You shut up! Idiot! - Kiran! - You're calling him a fool? Mannerless girl! Go and tell sister... this is the punishment to obstruct one's freedom. Get out of here. Forgive me, junior madam. I've committed a mistake. Here, take the money. Your sister has sent it. Rahul, today you've served only this much breakfast? - Yes, sir. - Yes sir? You'll surely starve me to death. So dear doctor, where are you going? I'm going to the station. I'm expecting some guests. Guests? And at your place? It's very strange. Who are they? He is some Seth Amritlal and his daughter. I understood. All this is to trap you, dear. But don't listen to anyone. You have promised someone. - I'm going unwillingly. - No, go willingly. And bring them home with love. And send them away after 2-3 days with respect. And if there's any problem, then call Colonel. - Go. - Thank you. - Move. Come on, move. - Remove the luggage. Dear Gulsundari, I can see neither Amarnath nor Shyam. Oh Shama, from where have you come? I had gone out. Why have you come here? I haven't come to take you. You didn't tell me and go. I thought someone at home must have told you. Who'll inform me at home? I worried the whole night over where you had gone. Coolie. We are doomed! There's no coolie, either. Okay, I'm leaving. Guests are arriving at home. Guests? Oh yes, I had come to receive them. Okay, you go. I'll be along. - Are all the preparations made? - Yes. The guests must be just arriving. Listen Munni, control your tongue. You too, Pappu. - Why, mother? - Shut up. Oh, so you have arrived, my son. Where is Mr. Seth? - He didn't come. - How is this possible? Did you search properly? Yes, I searched every compartment. You need me and I'm here. Shama, pick up these things. Here, dear. Take this. Take this. Shama, you go to the kitchen immediately. Here. Take this. Sister, I think you were born on a day of fasting. Neither you nor anyone else is allowed to eat. Here young man, why are you afraid, eat this. Very good. This is for parcel. Indu, take this. Here, take this. Take this. Here, eat this. Take this. I enjoyed it. What delicious food it was! Right, boss? Madam, the guests have arrived. Guests have arrived? Oh God! What will happen now? - Oh God! - So you arrived, Lala? - Greetings. - Greetings. - Greetings. We were waiting for you since morning. Did you have any problem while returning home? How can I've any trouble? You made full arrangements for my welcome. We sent Shyam to receive you. I don't know why he didn't find you. Forget these things. Give us tea soon. - I'm famished. - Tea will be ready in 10-15 minutes. - 15 minutes? - Yes. - Oh God! - Oh careful. What's the matter, Munni? You're giggling a lot. Have you seen our guests? It seems they've just escaped from the zoo. - Right, Pappu? - Yes. Shama, oh Shama. Munni, go and see what she wants. - I've to add salt to the rice. - I'll add the salt. - You go. I know everything. Right, Pappu? - Yes. Gulsundari and Shyam make a good pair. Where else will we find such a good proposal? Honey, this is fine. But we should ask Shyam once. You're too much. Why should we ask Shyam? The girl and the family are good. What else could he want? I called Shama, but she hasn't come yet. Why are you standing there like a statue? My throat has gone sore shouting your name. But you won't listen. - Is the food ready? - A little more time. And listen, take care about the salt and spices. Nothing should be amiss with the food. Not there, here. Seth, you seem a bit depressed. I alone have to handle the whole mill single handed. When Shyam comes, then I can relax. But Lala, I don't want a job at the mill. Dear, not a job, you'll become the owner. You'll get married to Gulsundari. - Lala, I don't want to marry. - Shyam. Why did you call me here if the boy wasn't ready? I had a loss in business and had to pay the train fare too. Seth, leave this to me. Don't listen to him. He'll have to listen to his parents. You eat food. Here, take rice. It's delicious. Oh God! So much salt! Did you ask us here to make fools of us? You call the guests home and insult them? Dear Gulsundari, get up. We'll return right now. - Seth Amritlal! - To hell with Seth Amritlal. - Let's go, dear. - Listen to me... listen here. Did you see your son's actions? He humiliated us in front of guests. And what terrible rice she cooked. She added a pot of salt to it. Madam, I don't understand why there's so much salt? Mother, it isn't Shama's fault. - I added the salt. - Good grief! You? I thought when the pot is so big, I should add more salt. Oh no! I'm so unfortunate. Dear Gulsundari, I'll take revenge on them. I left your house after being humiliated. So you arrived, Shama? I was waiting for you. You shouldn't meet me secretly, Mr. Shyam. I don't want you to lose the respect... of your family members because of me. When was I honored by them, Shama? Whatever it is, that is your house. You should take care of your parents' happiness. I never tried purposely to hurt them. Then why did you refuse the marriage? You're asking me this, Shama? This means you have no place for me in your heart? I've true love in my heart for you. But I don't want to separate you from your family. And the world humiliate you. That's why I request of you, to please forget me. I can't become yours in spite of being yours. Just think... how can we unite? You're the master and I'm a maid. There's a wide gulf between us. 'Really, we are totally apart.' Did you see, Shama? Now there is no difference between us. I don't know how it fell. I'll hang it there again. Let it stay where it is, Shama. Some great power wishes that I come to you. And humans have created these differences. Not God. Don't hang it on the wall, Shama. Its real place is in your heart. Such a good photograph doesn't belong in this poor girl's heart. Why not? By keeping it close to your heart... the beauty of the photo has increased. How can the beauty of a photo increase, Mr. Shyam? Say that this photo has blessed my heart. - It has made it beautiful. - Shama. Shama. Okay, I'll go now. Shama. Why did you go into Shyam's room? To clean the room. What was Shyam telling you? His picture was blown down by the wind. I was... You were clinging to it. Right? Wretched girl, you got two times meal... and you started being greedy? - Aunt! - I came to know now that Shyam refused... such a good proposal for your sake. That boy has gone mad from being influenced by you. Wretched girl, if you wanted to fall in love... you should have loved a man of your status. You cheap girl forgot your status? Get out of here. If you ever come here again, I'll kill you. Brother Shyam. Brother Shyam, Shama has gone away. What are you saying, Munni? Mother has fired her, brother. She has fired her? Oh! Shama. I regret whatever that has happened. - I regret a lot. - What's the use of regretting now? Didn't I tell you earlier? I'm not worthy of you. Please forget me. If you'd have listened to me that time... I wouldn't have been humiliated today. This is not your but my humiliation, Shama. She hasn't driven you out of the house, but me. I'm leaving this house. No, don't leave the house for me. Control your feelings. Stop yourself. Now no one can stop me, Shama. Look there. This water that is flowing out by... tearing apart the stones, can it stop? If no one can stop it, how can the storm in my heart stop? Shama, I'm leaving here tonight. And you'll have to come with me. No, Mr. Shyam, I can't come with you. A storm is rising in my heart too. Even my heart is desperate for freedom. But what should I do? I'm a woman. I'm helpless. I am bounded by restrictions. Then Shama, the love I saw in your eyes for me... was that my imagination? I misunderstood, Shama. You don't love me. You don't love me. Don't say this, Mr. Shyam. It's not true. I love you. I am yours, Mr. Shyam. I'm yours. Then you'll have to give a proof of your love. Answer me. Will you come with me? Mr. Shyam, I will come. Let anything happen. Before they reach here, before it is dark... and it spreads on our love, we'll go away. Yes Shama, we'll go away from here today. What's the matter? Why are you silent? Why don't you speak, Kiran? Tell me. What happened? What should I tell you, sister? It happened as you said. Ajit proved to be a fraud. He misguided me with his sweet talks. Promises of marriage, he played with my life. Now he has deceived me. So what can I do? That time you didn't listen to me. Blinded by love you considered it... an insult to talk to me also. You called me a maid in front of that loafer. You forgot that I took up a job so that you can study. I remained hungry so that you could eat. Forgive me, sister. I had really gone crazy. I've come to my senses now. And I know there is no one to help me besides you. Ajit is leaving this city. Go and stop him. Or my life will be ruined. You think about your life but forget that I've a life too. I also have hopes and desires. You've come back, Kiran. Forget all these things and concentrate on your studies. If Ajit doesn't care for you, then forget him. How can I forget him? My life is connected with his. You'll have to stop him. If he goes away leaving me with an illegitimate child... then I'll eat poison. Illegitimate child? What do you mean? - I am pregnant. - Kiran! What have you done? You didn't even think about the respect of your parents. The honor of this family is in your hands. Why have you come to me after committing this sin? Why didn't you die on the way? Go. Go away from here. Sister, won't you also support me? Alas! Only if my mother was alive today. Who hides the secrets of immature... daughters except a mother? 'Shama, I'm handing over Kiran to you.' 'Now you are her sister and mother too.' Kiran! - Wait, Kiran. - Let me go, sister. I'm not worthy of showing my face to you. - Let me go. - No Kiran, I'll come with you too. I'll stop Ajit. Come on. Come on, Kiran. Now wipe away these tears, Kiran. You're telling me to wipe my tears and you're weeping? I'm not weeping, Kiran. I'm not weeping. Come on, Kiran. Not from that door, Kiran. We'll go this way. Brother, where has Shama gone? Have you seen her anywhere? I met Shama on the way just now. She was carrying a bag. - I think she must have gone to the station. - Station? He who brought happiness to my heart... he gave me sorrows and went away He who had come to light the flame... he extinguished that flame and went away He who brought happiness to my heart Why has life become so miserable? He's asking this to his destiny He who had come to steal my heart... he deserted me and went away He who brought happiness to my heart... he gave me sorrows and went away He who brought happiness to my heart Oh forlorn lover, you aren't the only one who is ruined in love Many are disillusioned in this way They came and went away He who brought happiness to my heart... he gave me sorrows and went away He who brought happiness to my heart Don't worry. Shama has not gone anywhere. She has gone only to return. I don't know what's wrong. But Shama is not one of those who come and go away. Dear, I understand the story of your tears. Even I had wept once. I had also fallen in love. With Shanno. What difference does it make? I met her coincidentally, I fell in love. Sometimes these moon and stars, the colorful... seasons, shivering lips decide to misguide you. And you go astray. It is not bad to go astray. But to go astray and come to your senses is terrible. What happened after that, uncle Colonel? After that it's the same old story. Whether you get Shama or not, but I didn't get her. Dear, you also forget everything like me. You are a doctor, heal the patients. And God will heal your wounds. Come, dear. Come. Sister, there goes Ajit. Ajit! Wait, Ajit! Ajit! Ajit! Ajit! Ajit! Stop, Ajit! Please stop, Ajit! - Ajit! - Ajit! Ajit, what have you done? Ajit! Ajit! - Wait and I'll come to you. - Kiran! - Have you gone crazy? - Leave me, sister. - What's the point of remaining alive now? - Don't talk like that, Kiran. Humans do make mistakes. - You'll have to live. - For what? To hear the taunts of the people? - To weep for a lifetime? - No one will taunt you. No one will point a finger at you. I'm with you, Kiran. No, I'm a defamed and sinful girl. For how long will you support me? Why do you want to ruin your life? I don't want that my sinful deeds should mar your happiness. You are my life, Kiran. My life is with you. You hand over your life to me. I will consider it mother's blessings. I'll fight society to see a smile on your lips. I'll fight against the world. I'll fight against destiny. You come with me. We'll go to some city far away from here. We'll forget our past life and past relationships. 'Shama... Shama...' 'Shyam.' 'Shama, why did you leave me and go away?' 'Why did you reject me?' 'I am helpless, Shyam.' 'Maybe destiny wants that we should... suffer like this away from each other.' 'How will I survive without you, Shama?' 'You were my world. You have gone away.' 'Now what remains in this world for me?' 'Erase those memories, Shyam. Forget me.' You must forget me We won't be able to unite now The flowers have fallen from the branch How can they blossom now? You must forget me One day the partridge will see the lovely moon One day every wave will reach the shore I will keep looking I will keep looking and say this with tears in my eyes We won't be able to unite now You must forget me Music will be played and brides will be decked out Adorning their hands with henna... they will go to their beloved's house I will keep on looking I will keep looking and say this with tears in my eyes We won't be able to unite now You must forget me We won't be able to unite now 'You are silent as if nothing has happened.' 'Under your shade my and Shama's love prospered.' 'And today you didn't ask this also, why I am alone?' 'Where has your Shama gone?' 'Where has your happiness gone?' 'I know one day your Spring season will also go away.' 'When your flowers drop off... and a single gust of wind destroys your leaves.' 'But flowers and leaves will grow on your branches again.' 'Spring will arrive for you again.' 'But will my Spring ever arrive?' Kiran... one year has passed in making you understand. But your eyes are always misty and you look sad. What should I do, sister? I don't remember any moment in the whole year... when my sinful deed didn't make me weep. It has snatched my sleep and peace. Now it seems as if I'm burning in the fires of hell. It's been as if I committed suicide. Don't say that, Kiran. Ajit is responsible for the sin. He only aroused you to commit this sin. Your mistake was you got carried away by him. Still, you don't have to be disappointed, Kiran. If God punishes the culprit then he also... forgives the one that repents wholeheartedly. - Sister, will God forgive my sin too? - Why not? Kiran, now you think about starting a new life. Get up. Change your clothes. I don't have any interest. At least you wear good clothes. - Wait, I'll bring a sari for you. - No, sister. Look... you're looking so beautiful. If you'll wear some jewelry, even the moon will feel shy. Oh yes, I remembered at the mention of ornaments. I mortgaged a necklace with Manmohan. I'll send money today and get it back. Forget it, sister. I'm fine as I am. I don't wish to wear clothes or ornaments. If you won't wear clothes and ornaments... how will you attract your beloved? Yesterday, Dr. Ramesh said that if Kiran... bedecks herself, she'll look stunning. Don't mention Dr. Ramesh's name to me, sister. You work at his place but this doesn't... mean that he can say such things about me. Okay, not for him, at least wear it for my sake. I can't see you in this condition, Kiran. I want to see you happy at any cost. You want to see me happy, but you are also unhappy. It seems as if you're trying to forget some past memory. Sister, you are surely hiding some big sorrow from me. Mad girl, what sorrows can I have? No sister, your face and every part of your body... proves that you're hiding your past sorrow. Kiran! I told you I don't have any sorrow. I don't have any ailment. I am happy. I'm very happy. Okay, I'm going to work now. Wait, sister. I won't let you go disappointed like this. I'll do as you say. Now I've learned the customs of this world. Even if you're not hungry, you have to eat. Even if your'e not in the mood, you have to dress nicely. Even if you're unhappy, you have to smile. Mother, Shama didn't come yet? She'll be along. Why? Do you have business with her? No, I was just asking. I've understood. You want to talk about Kiran. Now you're always concerned about Kiran. Look, Shama is here. - Greetings, mother. - Greetings. - Greetings. - Greetings. - Dear Shama, listen to me. - What is it, mother? Bring Kiran for lunch some day. I'll see her properly once. Then we'll fix the marriage date of Ramesh and Kiran. I'll surely bring her, mother. But... please don't serve that food. What sort of food? The place I used to work earlier, there's a Seth... who brought a proposal of his daughter for my boss's son. That day children were up to mischief... and they added a lot of salt to the food. And then don't ask Seth's condition. He became angry and the son had an excuse. And he refused the marriage offer. He refused over such a trivial issue? No, there must be some other reason. Did he wish to marry someone else? I don't know this, mother. Okay I'll leave now. - I have many chores to do. - Okay, dear. 'Shyam!' - Mother. - What is it, dear? - I suddenly feel sick. - Then go home, dear, take rest. What happened, sister? You look sick? Yes, Kiran, I have a headache. Have a headache? I'll bring medicine from the market right away. Shyam, as much I try to forget you... just as much you return to my mind. As much as I try to erase the memories from my heart... just as much you come before my eyes. - Manmohan. - Yes? Give me these medicines. You always take medicines for ailing people, doctor. Tell me, did you cure your own aliment or not? Any letters from Shama? Look, Manmohan, don't talk so much. Just give me the medicines quickly. Well, sir, I only mention it because she's cheated me too. She took just your heart from you. But she took 100 rupees from my poor self. - Will you shut up or... - Look, sir, if you don't believe... then look at this necklace. She pawned this with me for 100 rupees. I think it's fake gold. - Sir, money order for you. - Money order for me? Yes, sir. Finally, the government recognized me. And has sent money as payment for my service. No money order but a warrant... warrant... will come from the government. This money order is from Shama Devi. Shama Devi? Get up, sister, it's morning now. You still don't look to be fine. - If you agree, I'll go to work today. - No, Kiran. I'll go myself. I've to discuss something important... with Dr. Ramesh's mother. About you. About me? What's this about? Kiran, see who it is. Don't let anyone come in. - Mr. Ramesh? - Kiran. Tell me, why are you here? The matter is, a guest is coming to our place. I've to inform Shama about that. And then I had to meet you also. Mother is missing you very much. When will you come to my home? Forgive me, I cannot come to your place. You're refusing? Okay I'll tell Shama herself, to bring you along. - Shama, are you not well? - No, I'm fine. I was just about to come. Come soon, and bring her along as well. Mother is impatient to see her. And she is... feeling shy to come. It's a matter of feeling shy. Whose child is this? This is my child, doctor. Yours? But you never mentioned it? How lovely. Looks absolutely like Kiran. A child's face often resembles the aunt's face. Okay I'll leave. You come soon. Yes I'll come in a while. What happened, my child? - Sister, don't touch the child! - Kiran? Why did you claim it's your child? What do you want after all? That you reach your destination. That your life gets settled. So, do you want to keep Dr. Ramesh in the dark and... get me married to him? You want to cheat him? I'll do everything for you, Kiran. Whatever punishment law and society will give me for it... - I'll bear with pleasure. - No, I won't let this happen! I don't want you to claim my child! That you carry the blemish of my shame! Do you know what it will mean? All the doors of life will get closed for you! You won't be able to get married throughout life! I can forget all my joys for your sake, Kiran. I want to see you a bride. I'll bring on that day when I'll be able to say to... mother's soul, look, mother your Kiran is smiling. No... no, sister! I won't let you play this drama! I won't let you hide a sin with another sin! I'll go right away and tell Ramesh... - I'm the sinner, the child is mine! - Kiran! Sister, out of my way, let me go! Kiran, I won't let you go! I say out of the way, move! Move, sister! Forgive me, sister. I don't know what happened to me. I would never lose my temper. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter, Kiran. I understand your sorrow. - Coachman. - Where do you need to go? - National park to Dr. Ramesh's house. - I'll take 1 rupee. - Not 50 paisa? - No. - Coachman. - Not empty. Come on, let the poor girl sit. Thank you. Shama? Shama! Shama! What happened, sister, you look very nervous? I've a headache, Kiran. You go quick and bring medicine from the market. Not from here, Kiran, go through the rear door. That will be better. Shama! Shama! What's happened to you, Shama? Earlier, too, you left me and today also... you turned away as soon as you saw me? What crime did I commit that you're angry with me? Look at me, Shama. Since the day you left me, what has become of me? So many days passed in the desire of seeing you. So many nights passed crying over your memory! I meet you for this and you don't talk to me? You told me, Shyam, I'm yours. What happened to your promises? What happened to your vows? Was all that false? Tell me. Tell me at least something, Shama. I cannot say anything, Mr. Shyam. I'm compelled, I'm helpless. What makes you helpless? What's the problem that you need to hide from me? Who is it that snatched you away from me? Shama, whose child is this? Whose child is this, Shama, answer me! This was the secret you wanted to hide from me? This is why you were compelled to leave me. This is why you fled here on seeing me. That's why you couldn't raise your eyes to me. Your love wasn't love but pretense. You made promises of love to me yet still held someone else's hands! Don't say that, Mr. Shyam. I was so wrong that I thought a woman like you to be the Goddess of Love. I wish your heart too gets shattered like my heart! May you also loose peace in the day and sleep at night! Let you also keep crying like you made me cry! Before you came, my heart was in ruins like this... and is in ruins again since you went away Oh, the writer has written ruination into my fate When the heart first received signs of your love... I thought my boat had finally found its shore But my destiny had something else in store for me When I opened my eyes, land was still far from the boat Oh, the writer has written ruination into my fate I left your world, to try and forget you... and I came here to shed tears My heart hasn't forgotten you yet, and again... my fate pulled you here to make me cry Oh, the writer has written ruination into my fate - There is something, sister. - I said there's nothing. I'm absolutely all right. You've started getting angry about everything, sister. You don't let me say anything. So, say what you have to to say. Perhaps I'm born only for listening to everybody... and not to speak of myself. Listening to everyone, not to speak of myself? - Did someone come here? - No, nobody came here. Who else apart from sorrow and pain would come here? Here, lndu dear. Oh yes, how is Shyam? Why ask about him? He's in a daze all the time. - Just keeps looking for his Radha. - He's Shyam after all. Even my name is Manmohan. But until now I've not won any girl's heart. The thing is, lndu dear, the modern girls run after fools. But, no one is running after you? Well, I'm not so fortunate that God... sends a girl to love me. Someone wants to get tied up, someone wants to break free. And, sir why do you attach such importance to a woman? If you find one, it's good for you. Otherwise it doesn't matter. This couldn't be so with me, sir. I've lost life for love. Who loses life, sir? Losing life is an excuse. Look at me. I lost life for love and became alive. Who are you, sir? I've never met you? Well, I'm called Kanwar Ajit. I came to ask the address of the Colonel's bungalow. - Yes? - I'm his nephew. Oh! You seem to be someone's nephew by face. - And you are? - My name is lndu. I'm Colonel's friend's daughter. And I'm just going there. - If you wish, I'll take you too? - Yes, of course. Where's the need to ask for favors? Come. God, people find matches in my shop. But your Manmohan is still alone. Now you say, uncle Colonel, is my life worthwhile? I face rejection at every step. Every breath is painful. Shyam, this pain is adoration of life. A life full of pain, consider it a colorful carpet. Lakhs of needles pass though it... only then colorful designs get made. Shyam, my son, keep doing your duty. Pay attention to your work. Your heart will find peace. Your dispensary is small, make it bigger. I'm ready to offer as much money as you need. Whom are you paying money to, uncle? Even I need money desperately. Hey, why do you need it, my loafer prince? You came here, uninvited, like death? Indu, where did you find him? Well, he was asking your address at Manmohan's shop. I brought him along. - He's very nice. - Nice? Unworthy, loafer! I always suffer a lot after meeting him. Son, now that you've come, so come. Uncle was kidding with his beloved nephew. This is called love. Shyam, this is my nephew, Ajit. Ajit, this is lndu's brother, Shyam. Oh, so you are Mr. Shyam. Okay then, I'll arrange for tea. Sir, your romance is being discussed in every house. Aren't you the one whom Shama has trapped? Look, sir, girls are not found by running after them. When they come, they come automatically. Anyway, I'm very pleased to meet you. Well, you don't mind him. He's always lost in his own world. - Okay, shall I leave? - Wait awhile and have some tea first. You be seated. I'll return in a moment. Indu! What do you need here now? Go home now! I don't like you to mingle with such loafer boys! - Who are you to order me? I won't go! - I say go! Yes so, Miss... I see, so this is the matter. Come on, bring tea quick. Find out who has come, Ramu. Indu went away? That's good, young girls should stay away from you. - Colonel, a girl wants to meet you. - Girl? Call her. What does a girl need here? Uncle, I've come, now who else would... come here if not girls? - You got nervous so early. - Be quiet! - Who is the doctor amongst you? - I am. Doctor, I went to your house. I learned you're here. - My husband is very sick. Come quick! - Come on. Let's go. Shyam, the weather is bad, take the heavy coat. No, uncle, that's not needed. Wow... wow, she was nice. So tell me, son, how's life? Doctor, no need to tell this to her. Her poor self stays awake the whole night. I feel sorrow, she flutters. - Her love has kept me alive till now. - What you say is a lie! A woman doesn't know how to love! She just knows how to cheat the man! 'Woman' is another name for 'cheat'! - What are you saying? Are you okay? - I... Forgive me, brother. I don't know what I said in insanity. Okay, I'll leave. No one should be cheated in love It makes you laugh for one day and makes you cry for 100 days No one should be cheated in love When I was not in love with anyone... then the eyes were not used to crying Love brings tears to the eyes No one should be cheated in love It makes you laugh for one day and makes you cry for 100 days No one should be cheated in love Look at my heart that got cheated It sang a love song by mistake But now it cries in pain day and night No one should be cheated in love It makes you laugh for one day and makes you cry for 100 days - I wonder how people enjoy tea alone. - Oh, Ajit. Your servant. Look, I'm at your service. Restlessness of the heart is a bad thing. If you hadn't come... then I'd have surely gone to your place this evening. One who initiates in love, wins the bet. - Indu, what are you doing? - Mummy, this is Mr. Ajit. - And she is my mummy. - Greetings. Stay happy, son. He is uncle colonel's nephew. I met him just today. I feel as if I've known lndu for years. He seems to be a very nice boy. - I don't like him, what, Pappu? - No! You people go and play. - Indu, make tea for him quick. - Okay, mummy. Mother, I got wet in the rain. Send a cup of tea to my room. To your room? Why don't you drink here? You've come till here so drink and go. Well I'm sick, you send upstairs. Then tell your father to hire a servant. You argue! Go away! What's the matter, Munni, what's the matter, child? Father, brother was sick, he wanted tea from mother... she refused, moreover he started mocking brother. I objected so sister slapped me. I'll go to give tea to brother, I'll see who stops me! I'll go to give the tea, child. You go and call uncle colonel. Here, son. Drink tea. - How are you? - I'm all right, father. Forgive me, son. Because of me you suffered so much. - What are you saying, father. - What I'm saying is right, son. Had I not married again... none of this would have happened. But, son don't feel that I don't see anything... even after seeing all this. My heart also aches. But I'm silent, only for the sake of the family's unity. So that no quarrels and disputes happen. You know there are small children at home. I understand your compulsion very well, father. Live long, son. But you have a high fever, I summoned the doctor. No, father. No need of doctor, it's ordinary fever. Not ordinary fever, son, this is some serious disease. It's eating you up from within. Why don't you reveal your heart to me? I failed to become your father, but I can be your friend. Nothing wrong with me, father. I'm absolutely all right. - Absolutely all right. - Shyam? - How is Shyam? - He's in bad shape, Colonel. I think I should call his friend Dr. Ramesh. I wonder what he is suffering with. I know what his sorrow is. What pain it is. And I also know... what should be prescribed. And where that medicine will be found. He doesn't know what the... condition of my heart is He doesn't know what the... condition of my heart is Shama? - Colonel, you? - Daughter, I've come to take you along. Shyam is sick. His condition is very bad. He's sick? What happened to him? The one who inflicted pain is asking what happened. Shama, Shyam's disease is not one... that can be cured by a doctor. Only she can cure that pain who has inflicted the pain. Colonel, now there'll be no use of my going. On seeing me he'll go crazy with anger. My sin has created a hatred in his heart. Don't call it a sin, Shama. Even the shadow of sin is foreign to you. You can deceive the world, you can deceive Shyam. But you can't deceive me. The same simplicity is still on your face... that I saw on the first day. You'll have to come with me. - Don't compel me, Colonel. - I'm not forcing you. I'm asking for my right. You remember, once I saw the gesture of love in your eyes... and stopped Shyam from leaving home? If I had not done so, then your love story... would have ended right there. You can't be so ungrateful... that I ask you for something and you don't give it. - I'll go, Colonel. - Live long, daughter. You get ready, I'll bring the car. Kiran, I'm going out on important business. I'll return by tomorrow evening. Going by evening and return by evening? Going by evening? What do you mean? Don't try to hide it anymore, sister, I heard everything. Now I understand why you used... to get upset while laughing. And why you used to call out Shyam... Shyam. You tortured yourself for my sake, sister. You held the pieces of your broken heart... and kept joining the pieces of my heart. For my sake you ruined... Mr. Shyam and your own life! Anyway, what was supposed to happen has happened. Now I'll accompany you... and tell the entire truth to Mr. Shyam! Don't do so, Kiran, I plead of you. Now your secrets are mine, your child has become mine. Your marriage to Ramesh has been arranged. Now don't spoil the ready broth! Don't think of my joy. My joy means your ruination. And I won't let it happen ever! Perhaps Fate decrees we... can't both be happy at the same time. Now I'll go to him for the last time. And I'll break even that wall of memories... that's standing in between the two of us. Dear Shama. Okay, Kiran now I'll leave. Take care of the child. And remember, if you want to play with your life... before that happens you'll see me dead! Shama, you've come here at my request. Now agree to another thing. Tell Shyam that there's no blemish of sin on you. Colonel, don't compel me to say this. If you remain quiet now... then Shyam will become quiet forever. Don't say that! First he had the sorrow of your separation. He endured this sorrow. When he thought the reason you left was your sin... it was as if lightning had struck his heart. There's still time, if you wish then Shyam's life... can be saved, things can be fixed. One who rectifies things is someone else, Colonel. Oh Rectifier, rectify the things Make our boat reach the shore Our world is in your hands Shape it if you wish, destroy it if you wish Make our boat reach the shore Oh Rectifier, rectify the things Make our boat reach the shore Thorns are here, thorns are there as well If you wish, turn the thorns into buds Make our boat reach the shore Oh Rectifier, rectify the things Make our boat reach the shore Oh Rectifier, rectify the things Make our boat reach the shore No... no. You aren't my Shama. You aren't my Shama. What have you done to yourself? I heard you don't even take medicine? - Please take the medicine. - No. I won't take medicine from you. I'll take medicine from that Shama, whom I loved. Each and every inch of my body is calling her. Forget that Shama, Shyam, she died long ago. It's been long, that Shama strangled herself. If that Shama is dead, then why... did this Shama come here? This Shama... who knows to play with... plays with another's life using the excuse of love. I didn't play with anyone's life, Shyam! I don't know. I don't even want to know. I want to die in comfort. Let me die. Go. Go away from here. Go away! Why are you standing there? Go away! Go away from here! Go away... go away. God, you still haven't answered my prayers. When will you answer, god? When will you answer? - Ajit. - Ajit? Let go of my hand. Indu, now you'll ever get me to release your hand. So, you pretended to drown to get rid of us. You thought you'd remain hidden... after playing with someone's life? You'd never come face to face with us? Humans can hide from another human, not from God! - Ajit, what is she saying? - No idea. She's a strange and crazy girl, and started making up stories as soon as she arrived. Come on, get going! I don't know even know you! You don't know me? I'm Shama, Kiran's elder sister. - Kiran who? - The one whose life you ruined... - and now you're denying it! - Stop it or else... - Come on, lndu, let's leave! - You can't go now! - Get out of the way! - No, I won't move! - Move! Ajit, what's this noise? What's happening here? Ajit, what's the matter, son? - Shama, you here? - Look, mummy... what is this crazy girl blabbering? She's accusing poor Ajit falsely! Wicked, you came earlier and left with Ajit's happiness. Now you came to place hurdles in my daughter's path? What grudge do you have against this family? What harm has Ajit done to you that you're after him? He's a cheat. First he ruined my sister's life. - Now he wants to cheat lndu! - This is an absolute lie! I don't even know her at all! But you know me, I suppose? But you may not know him. He came after you left. You must remember those days... when you played with my ignorant heart? Gave me false dreams, promised me happiness in life... and then one day you left with my happiness! Left this reminder for making me cry! You forgot me, but how could I forget the father of this child? None of this is true. I'm not the father of this child. This is the first time I've ever seen you. - You never saw be before? - Never. Think a little and say, perhaps you have seen me before? I told you already I've never seen you! Then why are with me in this photograph? All this is fraud. All this is a lie! An absolutely lie! - If this is a lie, then why are you fleeing? - Uncle Colonel? You played not with one but with many lives! You've wounded many hearts! - Now you also enjoy a wound! - No... no, uncle colonel! You started shouting before the bullet was fired? You worry for your life? You didn't care for the life of the one you tried to destroy! If she had committed suicide, then what would you've done? I was embracing death, but my sister saved me. For saving my life, she sacrificed... all the joys of her life! She strangled her heart and turned away from Mr. Shyam! - Kiran! - No, sister. Let me say everything today! For bringing a smile to my lips she... filled up my tears in her eyes! To hide my sin, she accepted my child as hers! So that I could get married to Dr. Ramesh! For the sake of my life, my sister died while alive! Ajit, you're responsible for Kiran's ruination... Shama's tears and Shyam's suffering! You're not a human but a blemish... on the name of love, on the name of family! On the name of morals, on the name of humanity! When I think that you are my nephew, I feel ashamed. I wish you'd not have been born in my family! I wish I'd have died before listening to the story of your sins! There's only one punishment for your sins, your death! No... no, I can't see his death! Punish me for his sins! If you've eyes, then see. If you've a brain then think. What are you and what she is! You're not even the dust under her feet! Beg at her feet... beg! If she forgives you, then you'll survive! Otherwise you'll be killed by me today! Kill me, I've no right to live. Penance for my sins will happen only in this way. I'm not worth Kiran. Marry her to Mr. Ramesh. No, Ajit, Kiran was yours and will remain yours. Kiran loves you, she wants you. You accept her, marry her. Forgive me, Kiran. And, Shama you forgive me. I misunderstood you. Father, now Shama and I'll leave from here. I found whom I was searching for. Shyam, my son, now you can't go anywhere. I was guilty, my obstinacy turned... the whole house into a hell. Now you all forgive me. Daughter, say you've forgiven me. You're asking a maid servant for forgiveness? - Not maid servant, daughter-in-law. - Yes! Come, daughter. You also come. You both also come. - Colonel, you come too, food is ready! - Food?
