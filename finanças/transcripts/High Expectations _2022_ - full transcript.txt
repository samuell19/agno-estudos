(knocking on glass) (door jiggling) Jack, it's Eddie. (lid closing) All right, tick tock, wakey wakey. (Jack groaning) - Oh, Eddie, what the hell are you doing, man? - What do you mean what am I doing? It's almost 1:00 PM, you lazy ass. Get up. - All right, all right. Give me a break, man. I was working till 3:00 AM. - Oh really? Because I heard you were out with Diane Connell last night. By the way, she left early because you were your usual charming self. She said you spent most of your time talking about your usual Armageddon world theories. Real nice job there, Chief. - How do you even know about that date? - Well, she's a cousin of a friend, of my girlfriend's second cousin, stupid. You don't think I know? - I know you know. You're something else, man. - Hey, uh, where's your uniform? - I don't know. Why do you care? - What do you mean what do I care? I told you I would pick you up. Bro, we're playing Pub Meisters today. - Pub Meisters, is that today? - Do not, do not tell me you forgot. That's funny. - I didn't forget. I didn't forget. - Okay. - But I'm not going today, so good luck getting that done without me, Champ. - No. No no no, not today, okay. Jersey, shoes, pants. Oh my God. - What? - It's your underwear. - Yeah. - Bro, I can smell that from here. I don't even wanna look at it, Bro. I don't even wanna look at it, Bro. Are you, are you kidding me? - It's stuck. It's stuck, it's hanging on a picture now. - No, it's stuck all right. Help! Somebody call the fire department hazmat team, because nobody should touch that. Bro, I gotta wash my hands. I gotta amputate, Bro. Oh my God, help. 911. Oh, disgusting. I do not care about any other game, but this one you cannot miss. Besides, you're our complete offense, and last I knew you need at least one goal to win a game. So, you're there. Also, you better have another pair of underwater or you're running to the field. You're not riding in my car. - All right, all right, I'm coming, okay. See you out there. - You're dead, no, you're walking. - Let's go. (soft piano music) (players chattering) Yes! (whistle blowing) Nice. (soft piano music) (players chattering) Come on, come on, let's go. Let's go! - Come on, ref, that was a foul! - Yes, Jack! Yeah! (whistle blowing) - Ref, are you crazy? - What, you kidding me? Six to nothing, slaughter rule, baby. Still undefeated. Have a good weekend, you guys. - See ya. - Okay, so, what are you gonna do for Labor Day? - I don't know yet, man. - I'm serious, though. If you don't have any plans, come out to the lake for the cookout. We'd be happy to have you. - Yeah. - You could bring a date with you. I don't know if Diane Connell will really return your call ever again, but ... - You're funny. Give me a second, yeah? - Yeah. - Hey, Sofia. - How was the game? - Good, we won. How you been? - Good. - Yeah, like okay good or real good or? Yeah. Eddie invited me to his aunt's place at the lake for Labor Day and, I don't know, you loved his aunt, remember? Think you wanna go with me? - I don't think so, Jack. We agreed, remember? - Yeah. - Ready? - Yeah. - Good game out there. (car door closing) - Give me one second, okay? - So you're with that guy now? - He's just an old friend. Jack. I really do hope you find your happiness. - Sure. - [Greg] Let's get outta here. (car door closing) (engine starting) - What was that about? - Looks like we're moving on. - [Eddie] I need a drink. Whoa whoa, I'm done. I'll vomit if I have another. - Vomit then. We'll take two. - You're not listening. Please. - Please. - Oh thank you. - This is a double. - Estrovia. - What are you doing? What does that mean? - It means we're moving on. - What? - Who gives a shit? - Estrovia means who gives a shit? - I mean who gives a shit? - Okay. - That's a smoke show. (clears throat) Hey, how are we? Yeah, so my buddy and I, McLovin down there, we got a bet. Was that a weird look or a smile that you gave me? - You mean like this? - Yeah, that's the one. - That's definitely my weird look. - That's good because that would a really weird smile, if it was. You actually have a pretty great smile. - Thank you. - What's your name? - Sarah, from Chicago. - So how long you here for? - Oh, we're actually leaving right now. It was nice to meet you. - Oh, yeah. Nice to meet you. Can I get your number? - Yeah, I don't meet guys at bars, especially drunk guys. - You're drunk? I'm not drunk. - Yeah, right, okay. Well then tell me one thing. - Hm? - What's my name? - Your name? - Mm-hm. Can't remember? - No, I know it. I know. - All right, I'll tell you what, if you can guess my name then you can go back to the hotel with me and all my friends' party. Can you say hot tub? - Hot tub, huh? Your name is Chicago Sharon. Wendy, Janet, Susan? Oh, let's go with the hot tub, Sahara. - Yeah, that's it, Sahara. Where'd you come up with that? - Oh, you know, like the desert. We have to get moving. Can I get your number? - All right, give me your phone. - Yeah? You won't regret it. - Yeah, I better not. - Text me when the tub is hot. - Mm-hm. - Okay, see you later. - What's up, Wood? What's up, Wood? What's up, Joe? Like that? - Wow, wow. How'd it go, Romeo? - You saw the look. She said she'd text me when the hot but was warm. - Which look was that specifically? - You gotta be kidding me. When'd she get here? - When you went outside. - Cool. - Jack, don't. - Hey, Sofe, how are you? - Jack, please, I'm with friends. - That's cool. I, I know that you said no earlier about going to the lake with me, but I think you want to and I just wanted to ask you what time you wanted me to pick you up at. - Jack, just leave. - Or? - Everything okay here? - Yeah, everything's okay. I'm just talking with Sofia. But I did have a question for you. Is it true what they say about guys who drive Maseratis? - What is that? - That they lack in other areas. - You can kiss my ass. - Well I would hate to mess up your hair. - Hey, hey, hey! - Sofia, I just wanna have a conversation. I just wanna have a conversation with you! - Sorry about that. - Joe, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. (Jack and Eddie shouting) - Why did you hang out with that guy? - [Kevin] Since star Eric Douglas got injured, Georgia just can't seem to score any goals. - [Jack] Come on, O'Brien, you gotta shoot that yourself. - [Kevin] Any easier for Georgia. Their next match day is against reigning champs Carolina, led by the Davis clan, legendary coach Harrison Davis, and his son, his all-star goalie, Sam Davis. - [Sally] Hi, Jack, this is Sally. I was just checking again if you got my message about tonight. It would really mean a lot to everyone if you came. Please call me. (gentle music) - Dammit. (gentle music) (gentle music continues) - [Harrison] I can't eat another bite of this cake. - [Joan] Oh, I think you can try. - All right, I'll try. - If you put your mind to it. Look at that. - Absolutely. - I know you can do it. - There you go. - Delicious. - [Sam] I asked for chocolate, but I-- - My body says no, but my mind says yes. - She does that. - Jack, you made it. I'll open the gate, meet you out front. - Great, yeah, I'll see you there. (engine chugging) - [Sam] Get outta here. - Dad, we've got another surprise. - Sally, please, no more surprises, please. - She's gone. - Do you know what it is? - Hey. - Hey, Sally. - Sorry, am I late? - No no no, of course not, you're perfect. Look who I found. - There he is. - Wow. - What's going on, man? - Hey, Buddy. - How's it going, man? - Wow. - Took you long enough, you good? - How are you, man? - Good, good. Been a while, what's up, man? - How are you? I don't care. - Hello, Jack. - Father. - This is my fiancee, Joan. - Nice to meet you. - Joan. Yeah, you too. - [Joan] You must be so hungry after that long ride. Do you want some cake? - I'm good. You know, I'll actually do some coffee if you guys have it. - So, Dad, Joan been taking you to these breath work classes or something? You blew those candles out like a champ. - (laughs) Thank you, yes. I did do a good job, if I must say so myself. - [Joan] Oh yeah. - Care to let us know what you wished for? - Well, you know I can't do that, but I bet you can all guess what it was. (group laughing) - Would it have anything to do with a record fifth championship trophy? Maybe. - That means another one for you if it happens. - A chip off the old block, right? - Oh that's right, Sam, congratulations, MVP. - Thank you, thank you. First unanimous ever, which is pretty good, if I may say so myself. (group chattering) I got the good genes, right, Sis? - You know, let's face it. We should all be grateful. It's been a really good year for this family, for the team. Sam. I was on the phone with the governor yesterday, and he wants you, Sally, to fill the vacancy of Representative Hillest. - Oh my God, Dad. - Congratulations. - Thank you! - Congrats. - [Sally] Oh my God. I've gotta call Raymond. - Yeah, yeah. - I'll be right back. - (yawns) Well, it's getting a little late for me. - Everybody, I've gotta get going. Little Billy isn't feeling well. - Aw. - Sounds like Daddy just fed him too much ice cream. Happy birthday. - [Harrison] It was quite a night. - I am so excited about the governor's appointment. - Yes. - Thank you. - Of course, Babe. - Goodbye, Sweetie. It was great seeing you. I've got a work-related case in Atlanta. I'm gonna call you. We're gonna get together, okay? - Sounds great. It was nice seeing you. And congrats again. - [Paul] I think I'm gonna hit the road too, follow you out. Dad, happy birthday. - Thanks, Paul. - [Paul] I'll see you at the game in Atlanta, right? - Sure. - [Paul] Hey, Joan, thank you again. - You know what, I'll walk you out. It was really nice meeting you. See you tomorrow? - Night. - Great. Oh, Sam, can you help me with something? - With what? (soft music) (footsteps padding) (soft music) - Come on inside. I wanna show you something. Take a seat. (door closing) It's good to see you, Jack. Look, I know how difficult things have been for you. I want you to have this. I found it in the safe. I think Mom would want you to have this. - Thanks. - Jack, I'd like to say that-- - Did you see the Georgia game the other day? - Yeah. Not much of a game, huh? - Yeah, Georgia looks like they're gonna be in big trouble after they lost Eric Douglas. - I doubt they can win without him. Look, I'd like to talk to you about something. - Not now, please. Maybe we can just say that I came over to see my family and it happened to be your birthday. - May I ask you one question? - Sure. - Are you happy? - Am I happy? What do you care? Think it's a little late for that? - That's not fair. - Sure it is. Why are we always pretending, huh? The truth hurts, doesn't it, Mr. Always Tell It Like It Is? - All right, look, just hear me out. I told you that you and I would be able to move on once you worked on your temper, your anger. If you can honestly tell me that you have, then I think we should move on to the next step. Are you doing any better? - Probably not much. - Still taking your meds? - No. Everything they've recommended makes it worse, actually. - Sorry to hear that. - Mm. - You know, you could pick up the phone, maybe call, talk once in a while. - You know the night that Mom died, I made a promise to her that I would talk to you and I would tell you how I really felt? I made that promise about three years ago. - What would you have said? - How come you never believed in me? - What? - You knew that it was my dream always just to play soccer. You know, play for you. Father and son. But then you would tell me to aim for smaller schools because you knew that I wasn't good enough to play Division One, definitely not in the pros. But I ended up on your team, and you cut me in front of the whole world without giving me a chance to prove myself, and then you tell a reporter that you knew Sam had the stuff of champions. You know what that's like? That's like going, Hey, world, the great and powerful Harrison Davis believes that his youngest son isn't worth a goddam thing. - I swore I'd never tell you this. No Division One school wanted you. I drafted you onto my team because nobody else would. I never meant to tell you, but you asked, so there it is. - There it is, I'm a favor? You never even gave me a chance. - I did give you a chance. - You knew that it was my dream. Bullshit, two exhibition games, with half the real team playing, that meant nothing, you know that. You won't say it, will you? Come on, Dad. Come on. Tell it like it is, right? You never thought that I was good enough, did you? - The team didn't think you were a fit for them. It was becoming a problem I couldn't ignore. - A problem you couldn't ignore? - I didn't mean it like that. - The hell you didn't. (scoffs) That's what you think of me. Your loser son Jack, rough around the edges, dropout, didn't inherit his father's hall-of-fame talent. - That's not true. - I knew I shouldn't have come here. - Jack, don't go, please. - You know, I can't wait to get outta here. You know why? Because as soon as I cross into the great state of Georgia I get to take a nice, big breath. - What good'll it to you to leave now? We can talk about this. I don't want things to go on like this. - Well, you probably shoulda thought about that a long time ago, uh? - Jack. Dammit! (soft dramatic music) (engine starting) (engine revving) (soft dramatic music) (soft upbeat music) - Yes, ladies and gentlemen, this is it. For the championship, Jack Davis trying to do something that he'll never be able to do, score a goal on his older brother and future hall-of-fame goalie, Sam Davis. - Come on, boys, dinnertime! Right now, it's gonna get cold. - Just a second, Mom. We'll be right there. - Don't give me that we'll be right there, Mom, stuff. - But, Mom, this is for the world championship. - Yeah. - Okay, since it's for the world championship. - You'll never get one past me. (soft music) - Remember, Jack, visualize. Visualize. - This is it, soccer fans, for all or nothing. Here we go. What a save! Let's go! Not in my house, not in my house! Never in my house. Let's go! (engine revving) (horn blaring) (wheels spinning) (tires squealing) (Jack breathing hard) (car whooshing) (crickets chirping) (knocking on door) (glass breaking) (banging on door) - Leave! I have a gun! I have a gun, and I've called the police! - [Jack] When'd you get a gun? It's me, Jack. - Oh my God. Jack, you scared the shit outta me. And I don't care drunk you are, you have to leave now. - Were you actually gonna shoot me? - No, idiot, I was threatening to shoot a burglar until I found out it was you. Now leave. - No, I haven't been drinking. Okay, I just came from my family dinner and, I did what you always told me to do. I told my dad how I felt. - You spoke with your father? - Big surprise, it didn't go well. - You can't just show up here like this. - I know, I know. I'm sorry. I just, I had nowhere else to go. - You know what? You can stay on the couch tonight. - Thanks, okay, I didn't know who else to turn to. Eddie's great, but not with this sort of thing. - I understand. - You know, it actually felt pretty good, telling him. Does that sound strange? - No, not at all. What'd he say? - Mostly the same. Except he admitted that he had no faith in me, and then he blamed it on the team. That's about when I left. - Good for you. I'm proud of you. It took guts to do what you did. And I'm sure you'll sort it out in the morning. - Yeah. - I'll get you some blankets. - Thanks. You know, I'm probably good with this one right here. (door closing) (footsteps approaching) Oh. And, sorry I surprised you like this. - No need to apologize. We'll talk in the morning, okay? - Yeah. You know, I've always been jealous of you and your family? Three brothers, two sisters, a mom and dad and, I don't think I ever saw anyone do anything bad to each other or do anything but love each other really. How real was that? - It was very real. I know it's unusual, but even as kids, we were all for one and one for all. Our parents really instilled in us that family was everything. We had so little, but we really had so much. I was very lucky. - Wow. Yeah, my family, we competed for pretty much everything. And not only the attention of Dad but also with every stranger who wanted a piece of him and his fame too. We just had to look out for ourselves. I guess that's way different than you. Seems like we had so much but really so little. - I know. Good night. (gentle music) - Night. (sprinkler clicking) - Jack, come on. It's time to wake up. (Jack groaning) - What time is it? - It's time for you to go to school. - What? - You heard me. You always promised to check out my school, but you never did. Well, I decided that today is the day. - As much as I'd like to, I think I have a temperature today, Miss Portales. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, very funny. - Isn't today Labor Day? - There might not be classes, but there's still rehearsals for the performance at the fall assembly this week. - Was your friend around last night? - Just get dressed. - Yes, ma'am. - The Thai Bar, I haven't been here in a minute. - You want coffee? - No, I'm good, thanks. You know what, actually I'll for a caramel macchiatto? - Whipped cream and an extra shot still? - Is there another way? - (chuckles) Guess not. All right, I'll be back. - Thanks, Sofe. (upbeat music on stereo) (phone buzzing) (phone pinging) - Okay. And here you go. - Thanks. - Mm-hm. - You got a call from someone. - I'll call him back later. Ah, I love this song. You know, I haven't given up. - Really? I haven't either. You know, I was actually just thinking about this that I think we're both in a much better place-- - No, Silly, on my music. I just completed my very first demo. - That's great. Can I hear it? - No. - What do you mean no? - You might not like it. - What are you talking about? I've always liked what you've done. Come on, email the file to me, Sofe. - No, they haven't even finished mixing it. They'll hopefully finish mixing, they said, next week, so. - Oh yeah, they'll mix it next week? Don't lie to me. - I'm not lying to you. - You are lying to me. You always do that. You blink like that when you're lying. - I do not blink. - You do blink. - [Broadcaster] With the morning sports. The word is, Coach Briana Scurry of the Georgia Wild soccer team could be fired if the team doesn't win one of the two remaining games-- - It's a bummer because she's a great coach. You know, she used to be an assistant for my dad. - Wait wait wait, you know Coach Scurry? - A bit, yeah. - Well why don't you talk to her, get a tryout? I mean, you heard what they said. They desperately need a striker. - For the Wild? - You're a striker, right? - Yeah, but in a podunk industrial league. It's nuts. - Come on, I bet you're better than that old guy who's way past his prime. - Sofe, look, nobody will even give me a tryout after what my dad did to me. Okay, Coach Scurry will just think I'm crazy. - You haven't changed, one bit. - No, I have changed. I just, I don't wanna put the coach in a awkward position. Okay, especially after knowing my father for so long. - Why don't you think you could play great for Coach Scurry? When will you stop worrying about what other people think about you or the expectations they have of you? Especially your family. It's the same argument we have over and over again, Jack, and I'm tired of it. - You too, Sofe, huh? - That's exactly what I'm talking about. Quit playing the victim all the time. It got super tiring when we were together, and it's still real old now. (engine starting) (birds singing) (footsteps thudding) - Good morning, everyone. - [Class] Good morning, Miss Portales! - Everyone, this is my friend Jack.

Is this the '90s? - [Jack] I don't care, I'll hear it eventually. Watch. - Listen, about dinner? I can't today. I already have plans. - With who, Biceps? - That's none of your business. (phone buzzing) - Hey. - Hello, hey. - No, I'm not running late. I told you, it's not fair to ask me that. I'm here. Okay, bye. - Hey, I just wanted to say thanks, for everything. Thanks for letting me stay last night. - You're welcome. It'll all work out, believe me. I'm glad you finally said something to your father. - Yeah. I'll see you. Hey, Sofe. Let me buy you lunch sometime, huh? - (sighs) Could you handle us being just friends? (birds chirping) I'll make you a deal. - Yeah, what's that? - If you go see Coach Scurry and ask for a tryout, I'll buy you dinner at O'Nesta's. - O'Nesta's, that's our spot. Are you being serious? - Do I look like I'm bullshitting? - All right, you throw in your demo and you got yourself a deal. - No no, no no no, I told you. It's being worked on. - I'll think about it. - [Joan] So, are you mad at Sally? - [Harrison] Why would I be mad at her? - For inviting Jack without talking to you. - Oh, she was just trying to help. I love her for that. - Hm. - I talked to Paul a little while ago. He says Jack's doing fine. He's gonna have dinner with him in Atlanta when the team's playing next week. - I wish I could help more. - I wouldn't recommend that. Jack was pretty close to his mom, probably closer than all the other kids. - What about you? - Oh, we got along great when he was a kid. Then when his mom got sick, he just got angry. Mostly at me, I think. - What about the other kids? - Well they were all affected in their own way, but not like Jack. Unlike Sam and Sally, Jack just bottled it all up inside. - And Paul? - Well, Paul, he was some kid. He just took it all in stride, even tried to help Jack. Sam and Sally, they're A types. Sam was actually pretty hard on Jack. And then finally Jack figured out his mom was not gonna make it. It got really bad. Add to that the fact that he couldn't get past the practice squad on my team. I guess that just proved to be too much for him. - Well, looking back, do you think you could have kept him on the team? - It was the toughest decision I ever made. But my father told me that when you're making decisions, especially about the players, the team comes first, no matter what the emotions are. - Oh, honey, that musta been really difficult. So, are you gonna call Jack? - Oh, I guess I'll give it a couple of days (chuckles). I'll call him after he has dinner with Paul. - Good plan. (lips smacking) - [Kevin] Reigning champions Carolina cruising four goals up late as Georgia, looking to get on the board. Nelson strikes, easy save for Sam Davis. - Nice hands, nice hands. - [Dave] Oh, typical Davis. Look at him taunting the Georgia crowd. - [Kevin] Some may call this confidence; others arrogant. - Come on, boo! Look at him, man. My brother's such a freaking hotdog. They're up by five goals and you woulda thought he just won the game. - It's funny because I kinda hear like a little jealousy. - No. - Like a tiny baby. You know for a hotdog, he's kinda good. Musta been pretty hard trying to follow in his footsteps, huh? - Yeah, you don't wanna know. (crowd groaning) - Did your dad ever talk to you about playing for him? - Want another beer, Eddie? You're good? - I'm good. - Yeah, me too. - It's crazy, you know. Your brother is Sam Fricking Davis, and your dad is Harrison Davis, you know, and you been keeping this on the DL? - Yeah. Yeah, no, thanks for not talking about it around a big group of fans. - Did you guys know that this ... - Yeah, I'm gonna head out. I'm gonna head out. I'm meeting up with Paul for dinner tonight, and I'm putting in a shift later. This game's a blowout. I'll hit you later, yeah? - All right. - Thanks again for the tickets, man. - Anytime. Aw, come on! (taxi radio chattering) - Oh, I'm not on duty. - Hey, are you available? - No, I'm sorry, I'm off duty. Sorry about that. Yep, get the door. - Hey. - Jack. - How are you? - Good, good to see ya. - Good to see you. - You see Dad? He just left. - Why is he here? - The whole team's staying here. - Can we go somewhere else then? - No. - No, seriously, if they're all here, I don't wanna eat here. - Come on, sit. Don't worry, it'll be fine. Sit, sit, sit. You end up going to the game? - Yeah. - So why didn't you use the ticket I left? - Because I went with my friend Eddie. He's got season tickets. - [Server] Sir? - Hey, could I get a club soda with lime, please? - Oh, come on, I'm leaving in the morning. - I know. - [Server] Be right back. - So let's have a good time tonight. - Well I gotta get up early. I got bills to pay. - Okay, well, don't give me that. Do you know how much money is in that trust fund of yours? - I don't care. - You know Dad told me he's letting you have access to some of it now? - It's cool, but I don't want any of it. - Okay, what are you talking about? - You know the guy. If I take something, then I owe him something. I'm not gonna owe that guy anything. - Okay, that's not the case. You're not gonna owe him anything. What, you'd rather drive a taxi? Come on. - No, I don't wanna drive a taxi, but I have to do it to pay rent. - You have always been one of the most stubborn people that I know, you know that? - Thanks. - Yeah, you're welcome. Thank you. - You're welcome. - Oh God. - What? - The self-anointed king has arrived. - Hey, here we go. Hey, good to see ya. - Dude, this is exactly why I didn't wanna sit down and eat. - Just take it easy. There's nothing we can do at this point, okay. - I don't get it, man. What, one doesn't satisfy him anymore? - No, he needs at least three to satisfy that ego. - I'll be damned. Ladies, it's my two brothers, Humpty and Dumpty, sitting all by themselves. This is Tawny, Patty and ... - [Bridget] Bridget. - [Sam] Bridget, is her name. - Yeah, that's real classy, Sam. - What are you doing here, Jack? - I live here, Sam. - Oh, that's right. You know, I was kinda hoping maybe you would take us all on a ride in that Ferrari you been driving around. - [Tawny] He has a Ferrari? - No, he doesn't. He just likes driving real fast, don't you, Buddy? I will see you all later. Hopefully much later! - Good one. (Sam laughing) - (snorts) Woo. - How does he not bother you? - I never said he doesn't bother me. Okay, it's just nothing compared to you. - Why? - Because you feed into his always hungry ego by letting him know that he gets to you. - It's because I can't help it. - You kinda can. Also, take into account that I am the brain of the family, with no athletic ability, so I'm not the one competing with him. - I just think if I look back at it, there's probably some stuff that I woulda done differently. - Like what? - Stood up for myself. Even knowing that he probably woulda beat the living shit outta me, I just, I think it would made a big difference, you know? - Is it too late now? - I'll take a swing if you'll back me up. (Paul laughing) - Thanks. - Yeah. - You moron, that's a club soda. - I was gonna say, that's a club. You know, with his tolerance, he'll have a buzz. (both laughing) Oh God. (Jack sighing) You remember what Sam would always tell me when we were kids? - No, what? - That there was no way that I could be a Davis, because I didn't have one iota of athletic ability, like the two of you guys do. I was probably the son of that weird mailman we used to have, remember him? - The guy with the big calves? - The big calves, that guy Craig or something. - Yeah yeah yeah, Craig. That's funny, though, I actually agree with Sam because you guys have the exact same noses (laughs). - Oh, okay, now he's a funny guy. - No, I'm just playing, but they were pretty similar. (both laughing) You know, sometimes I like to imagine that Mom's somewhere listening to us and laughing along. - You got that right. (soft music) - All right, don't forget your basics. Two touch, let's go back. - Two or one, Eddie? - Two. Hey, hey, the cones, the cones. - I'll hand this one to you, Eddie. (players shouting) Okay, yeah, and on that note, that's enough for today. Yeah, that's enough. All right, okay. Hey, good work today, you guys. - We, we're headed to the bar? - Oh please. Please. Hey, I'll see you guys at the bar. - Yeah. - We'll see you, man. - Drinks on this guy. (soft music) - [Jack] Look at that, our spot's open. - Bada bing. Wait, the Wild are switching Wayne Fuller to a striker. - Fuller? - Bro, this is not good. - Wayne Fuller? - My grandmother can play better offense. Is it bad? Okay, I need a refund on my season tickets. Help, help. - I don't blame you. Sounds like they're desperate. - Oh man. Refund. - Hey, what time is it? - It is time for you to get a watch. - No, seriously. - It's 4:30. - Yeah, I gotta go somewhere. - Where you gotta go? - Yeah, I'll be back for happy hour. I'll tell you later. - Who is she? - I gotta go. - Okay, I'm out, I'm out. Good luck. - I'll see you in a bit, dude. - See ya, Buddy. (soft music) (Jack breathing hard) - Come on. (Jack breathing hard) Come on now. No, no. (fist pounding) (Jack breathing hard) - [Disc Jockey] Welcome back. I hope you don't mind if I do something a bit different today, introduce you to someone. Remember this name, Sofia Portales. I've received many demos over the years and rarely play one, but I think this is something very special. Here's Sofia with her debut song, "High Expectations." (gentle music) (Jack sniffing) (gentle music) ♪ I'm tired of those high expectations ♪ - Oh my God. ♪ The prodigal son ♪ ♪ A chip off the block and now ♪ ♪ Be thankful, you're even better off, hm ♪ ♪ Tell those expectations where to go ♪ ♪ With all those who doubted you so ♪ ♪ They never really knew you like me ♪ ♪ That's all I could see ♪ ♪ That's all I could see ♪ ♪ Hoo ♪ ♪ Hoo hoo ♪ ♪ Hoo ♪ ♪ Has nothing to do with fortune or fame ♪ ♪ Associated with ♪ ♪ Your silly last name ♪ ♪ Please realize this ♪ ♪ So we can dream ♪ ♪ Again about you, about you and me ♪ ♪ Oh ♪ ♪ Tell those high expectations where to go ♪ ♪ With all those who doubted you so ♪ (door jiggling) (knocking on glass) - Hey, can you open the door, please? Please. Thanks. - Can I help you? - Yeah, I need to see Coach Scurry. - We close at five. - Is she in there? - Do you have an appointment? - No. - Well, I'm sorry, you're gonna have to have an appointment. - Please, this is really important. - What's your name? - Jack Davis. Coach Scurry already knows me. - Louise, I have a Jack David here. - Davis. - Jack Davis? - Sorry, Jack Davis. - Jack Davis. - [Louise] Who is he? - Mr. Davis, you're gonna have to make an appointment. - Yeah, okay, well, when can I see her then? - It'll be have to be sometime next week. - I don't have until next week. Okay, just tell Coach Scurry that I found her missing striker. - What did you say? - Yeah, let her know I found the striker that you need. Okay, I'm serious, it'll be worth it. - Okay. Be right back. (Jack breathing hard) Good news, coach Scurry will see you now. - Oh, thanks. Hey. - Hey, Jack, it's been so long. It's good to see you. - Good to see you too, Coach. - So, how's the family? I see your dad and Sam when we play each other, but we don't really get a chance to talk. - Family's, uh, doing well. - Great, glad to hear it. So what's this about finding the striker the whole world knows we need? - Yeah, I know you're really busy, but just hear me out before you toss me outta here, okay? - Does your dad even know you're here trying to help me? They beat the crap out of us last week. - Yeah, he doesn't need to know about this. Okay, I know that this can sound crazy, but I can be the striker that you're looking for. I know it. - You can be the striker? You? - Yes, Coach, me. - Jack, when's the last time you played? - I play all the time. It's just mostly industrial league. - (chuckles) Like I said, when's the last time you played pro-level soccer? - Three years ago, when my dad cut me. - Come on, Jack, you gotta give me a break. Your family and I, we go way back, but this just doesn't work. You haven't played in three years since your own father cut you. Not to mention that temper you have. - I've worked on my temper, and my touch is as good as it's ever been. Look, do what you need to do, but I'm definitely better than any striker you've had since Douglas got injured. - Your talent has never been the issue. You lack self-confidence. You've never believed in yourself. - I walked in here and told you that I'm your man. I'm pretty sure that confidence isn't the issue right now. - Well I gotta give you credit for that, but you gotta-- (phone ringing) - [Receptionist] Mr. White on Line One. - Thank you. Jack, I'm sorry, I got a lot on my plate. I really have to take this call. - Just give me a workout. - You're really putting me in a tight spot here. - I know. I won't embarrass you. Okay, I promise, just all I'm asking for is a shot. - I'll tell you what. I'll give you a few minutes at training tomorrow. No special treatment. You better prove me wrong, or everyone's gonna think I flipped, and maybe I have. - You won't regret it, Coach. - Maybe I already do. Are you even in shape? - You'll see. - All right. (sprinklers spraying) - Thanks. - Jack Davis, right? From the first family of North American soccer. - That's a good one. Nice to meet you. - What are you doing here? - Okay. I'm training with the team today. - You're just training, really? That's a little weird. Nothing to do with you joining the team, though, right? - Nah, of course not. - Yeah good, because I'm not a fan of the Davis family. Known your brother a long while. I can't stand him. Or your pops, who cut me for no good reason. - Check that out. Makes two of us then. Because he cut me too. - Yeah I know. - Who doesn't? - Listen, man, I'm gonna do everything I can to keep you off this team. We may need a striker, but the Davis family and the stench that goes with it, it's the last thing my team needs. - We'll see you on the field, Keep. (players chattering) (gentle music) - [Creekmore] Who's this guy? - [Briana] This is Jack Davis, Coach Davis' son. - [Creekmore] Coach Davis from Charlotte? - [Briana] The Coach Davis, yes. We're gonna give him a try. He came in. Figured let's have a go. We have trouble scoring goals. So we'll give him a chance. - He's that good, huh? - I hope so. I hope he is. He's got a good hit. He has decent speed. - All right, I'll go check him out. - All right, thanks, Coach. - Jack Davis. - Coach. - Assistant Coach Creekmore, nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. - You ready for this today? - Hope so. - All right, we're gonna get you set up on those balls over there. Need to do some measurements of your kicks, see what kinda shape you're in, get you in some of these drills too, okay? - Cool. - I want you to try to kick all these balls in the goal without stopping. Between each shot, backpedal around the cone, on to the next ball. I'll tell you when to start. - Cool. - Go. (Jack kicking) Around the cone. (Jack kicking) All the way around the cone, hustle up. (Jack kicking) (soft music) I need it harder. Hustle up, hustle up. (Jack kicking) One more, come on. Hey, Jack, need you to start running laps. Not gonna tell you how long you have to run, but if you don't maintain a six-minute mile, then any chances you might have are done. - Okay. - Just get ready to go on my mark. Set. Go. (upbeat music) Hustle up. (upbeat music) Good. Good, 11:55, 56. Barely made it, Davis. Hustle up, back to the balls, let's go. - Shots? - Shots. - All right, Goalie. - You sure about that? You need a little break? (Jack kicking) You mean like that? Come on, I'll give you a freebie. (Jack kicking) Oh, that's cute. So you wanna hit the other side, or are you just gonna keep going left? Ooh, I'm sorry. You gonna put some power behind that kick or what? I mean, come on. - Yo, I missed your name. What is it, Douche Bag, right? What's up? - What you say to me? (group shouting) - Back off, back off! Back in goal, Dennis, back in goal! Listen up, listen up! Hey, you wanna make this team? - I got you. I got you, Coach. - All right, back to the cones. Drilling and agility. Touch all cones, down and back, down and back. Faster. Now sprint. Sprint! Back, down and back. All cones, let's go, sprint! - Jack, you're up, let's go. - Come on, you're in! Hustle up, Davis. - (blows whistle) Play on, let's go! (soft upbeat music) Jack, you're offsides! What's going on? Come on. All right, we don't play stupid here! All right, guys, corner kicks. Let's go, corner kicks! - Nice play, Messi. - Guys, guys, come on, we have to be able to score on these set pieces, let's go! Left side, left side now! (upbeat music) All right, that's more like it. Sprints, over here, wind sprints. Jack, come on. All right, you didn't embarrass yourself or me. The coaches and I are gonna have a conversation about you tonight, and we'll let you know. - Thanks for the chance, Coach. - I can't guarantee you anything. - Got it. - All right, off you go. - See ya. (Briana applauding) - Let's go, guys! - [Jack] I don't know, I just completely whiffed on the first header. - But you made the one right after, right? - I don't know. I don't know what Scurry's thinking. I mean, I don't know if she's gonna call me or-- - I think you're worrying too much. No matter what happens, I'm really proud of you. - I mean, I owe so much of it to you, right? Can you believe it was your song that was playing when I was freaking out? - But you're the one who did it. That's what's important. - Yeah. Your song? - Yes. - Did you write that after we broke up? - Yeah. Are you okay with that? - Yeah, yeah, of course. I think it's so good. I know you hate when I say it, but I think you're gonna be really big. - (chuckles) Thanks. - Yeah. - Means a lot to me. - So how are your students? - They're great. They did so well at their school assembly. And they've been asking about you. - Oh, must be the rapping. (Sofia laughing) - I'd be down to come around and see them again. - I think that could be arranged. - Yeah? Cool. (phone buzzing) Oh shoot. Um. Yeah, I'm gonna, I'm gonna take this real quick. I'll be right back, quick. - Good luck. - Hey. - [Briana] Hey, Jack, this is Coach. I have a decision for you. - Oh, hi, Coach, how are you doing? - After a long deliberation with the other coaches, we've seen that the long layoff has affected you. (soft music) - Hey, it's okay. You did it, and I'm proud of you anyways. No! - Yeah. - Yes? - Yeah. - She said yes! She said yes! (diners applauding) - Yeah, woo! She said yes! - No, no no no, it's not that. I'm sorry. - (laughs) Yeah, sorry about that. (Jack laughing) Oh my God, cheers, cheers. - Late here in the second half, as expected, a low-scoring match between Chicago and Georgia. It's Chicago, the home side, that leads by a goal to nothing. - And here in the Windy City the Wild looking to catch a second wind. - Come on, boys, here we go! Keep the ball, keep it! (crowd cheering) - [Kevin] And another misplaced pass by the Wild. - [Dave] And you can see the frustration in their body language. - [Kevin] A strike from distance now. Oh, it's a good save. Really good stuff by Dennis Brady. Georgia relying on their goalkeeper as they build outta the back, and what can Briana Scurry's team offer? - Find him wide! Find him wide! Nice. - [Kevin] Better buildup play from the Wild. The ball, to the feet of Florin, onto his right boot. Blazes it! - [Dave] Ooh, looks like his age and knee surgeries are beginning to take a toll. - Come on, come on, be on the end to end, let's go! - Coach? Hey, put me in. Coach, I can get us the goal. - What the hell are you doing? Get back on the bench. - I can get us the goal we need. - Coach will tell you when to get up, you got it? - Yeah. - [Dave] Chicago's defense has prevented Georgia from getting out of their own half. - [Kevin] After a perfect start to the season, winning seven straight games, the goals have dried up since losing striker Eric Douglas. Now a fourth straight loss for the Wild. Next week, it'll be Dallas visiting Georgia, and the winner of that match will go on to play in the championship game. - After the chance I took with you, that, really? Don't say another word to me. I should cut you right now, with a game left, but you know what? I'm not gonna do that, because I don't wanna embarrass your father, or your family. - It has gotta be so frustrating when you just can't mount any offense. - Georgia's scoring woes continue. Another loss for the Wild and now they cannot afford another slipup. Let's head back to studio for post-match analysis. (footsteps padding) - Welcome. - [Jack] Hey, everyone. - Hello. - Hey. - Jack, do you really play for the Wild now? - I sure do. That's a nice jersey, looks good on you. - All right, everyone, that's it for today. - Hey, what's his name? - Jerry. - Jerry. - Hey, Jerry, would you wanna go to the next Georgia Wild game? - For real? - For real. - Of course. - Awesome. - Guys, guess where I'm going! - Oh, I hope that's all right that I invited him to the next game. - (chuckles) Of course, he'll love it. - Yeah, I figured it better be this game, you know. I could have a whole playing career where I never get off the bench. - Hey, I thought you agreed to stop talking like that. - I know. And I just, you know how bad I want an opportunity to get out there, you know, prove myself. - I know. - Should we get outta here? - Yeah. - Good day? - Yes. - Yeah? - Yeah, it was good. Not any rapping this time. - No rapping. (fans applauding) - [Kevin] Oh, and William Ford misses again. - Coach Creekmore? - Yeah, Coach. - I've seen enough of this. Might as well see if Davis can do anything. - Got it. Davis, off the bench. Start warming up, right now. Let's go, hustle. - Let's go, Wild, let's go, intensity! - Jerry, look, Jack's warming up. I hope this means he's going to go in. - Jack, come here. You're going in for Florin at striker. Look at me. This is your time to show what you can do. We just need one goal. Now get in there and do it, all right? - Yes, Coach. - All right. Here we go, Wild, here we go! - [Kevin] Enough is enough for head coach Briana Scurry. Substitution for the Georgia Wild. Jack Davis, a late-season signing set to enter for the veteran Florin. With the season on the line, can Davis be the key? (soft dramatic music) - [Dave] As Davis comes on for his Wild debut, remember, this is also his professional debut. - [Kevin] He needs an instant impact with Georgia trailing by a goal to nothing. It's Davis now combining beautifully. Georgia on the hunt for that equalizer. The ball now, to the feet of Jack Davis. In on goal, brought down edge of the area. - Free kick, Georgia. - Come on! - Back off! - Stop it, no, no no no. - [Dave] Newcomer Davis is giving Georgia the spark they need. - Nice, Jack, way to keep your head. Let's go, let's go, Wild! - [Kevin] Yellow card for Dallas defender Blake. Georgia need a goal, and this, a prime-time opportunity. Davis takes his place inside the danger area. Diego Sanchez over the ball for Georgia as Lynn sets his wall. Sanchez delivers. Davis, goal! - Yeah! - Yes! (crowd cheering) - [Dave] Georgia has tied the game at one on a goal by Jack Davis, and look at the Wild fans! They are going crazy! (crowd cheering) - [Kevin] Georgia on the attack once more. Beautiful ball, Jack Davis delivers for Garcia, oh! How the tide has turned. Georgia playing brilliantly now. - Come on, Jack. - Come on. - [Kevin] Pass to the onrushing Jack Davis. The cross is a good one, Garcia with the shot! (crowd cheering) - Yeah, woo! (whistle blowing) Here we go, woo! - [Dave] And there goes the full-time whistle. Late drama that sees Georgia advance to the championship game. (crowd cheering) What an amazing ending to a great game. Davis brought a tremendous amount of energy with him into the game. - [Kevin] You're absolutely right, Dave, and this is exactly what the Wild have been missing. And talk about a phenomenal way to advance while also winning the South Division. Their attack was on fire, far superior to anything we've seen all season, hitting the target 21 times. Now let's head north to Boston, where the Big Blue are hosting the Preying Mantis of Carolina. - What a year, huh? What a month, man. - Unbelievable. - Yeah, I owe a lot of this success to you, man. - What? - I do. I do. - Come on, what did I do? - I don't know if I could ever tell you. - Hey, you know what? Forget about it. - Stop. No, never, man, thank you, though. To you. - To Boston. - Boston, why Boston? - Well yeah, with our win and if Boston doesn't lose to Carolina by more than two goals, you know, you don't have play your father's team. - Cool. - Hey, you don't wanna play your father and brother for the league championship, do you? - I don't care who we play. - Just saying. - Mm, bring them on. What? - Look who it is. - Jesus. - Cool, man, just be cool. - I'm good. - [Greg] Congratulations on your success, Jack. - You really mean that? - Of course. Oh, and I, and I also wanna introduce you to someone. Jack, meet my friend Mike. - What's up, Mike? - Big Wild fan. - Yeah. - You really do know Greg? - Yeah, yeah, Greg and I are good friends. - Wow. Can I get a pic? - Yeah, sure. Sure, yeah. How about all three of us? You want me to hop into the middle? All right. - Okay, ready? Everybody say Wild! - [Group] Wild. - Yeah (laughs). Look at you, big shot. - He just pinched my ass. - Greg? - I'm serious, guys. I must be crazy. I think he pinched my ass. - I tried to tell you we were just friends. - No, you didn't. - Yes, I did. Mike is his boyfriend. He probably did that to get even with you after everything you've done to him. - Yeah, no, well he got me back. - Hey, hey, hey. Final. - Uh-oh. - Carolina six, Boston three. It's gonna be an interesting week. - What does that mean? - It means we got a date with my dad and Sam. - Wow. - Yeah. - You gonna be okay with that? - Of course. No no, I couldn't be happier. - Cheers to that, Buddy. Aint nothing but a thing. - Couldn't be happier. (basket thumping) (phone dinging) - [Harrison] Jack, this is your father. Look, I need to talk to you. Please call me. (phone dinging) (soft music) (phone dinging) (soft music) (phone dinging) (soft music) (players chattering) - Ah! - Dammit, Jack, that is at least twice you've missed that today, what is your problem? - Sorry, Coach, I got it. - Hey, sorry's not gonna cut it, all right. If you don't focus right now, you're gonna find yourself on the end of that bench, and you know I'll do it! All right, let's go, let's go! - [Fan] Good job today, Dado. Tell Mateo hi for me, huh? - Any predictions on the game, Sam? - Predictions? Yeah, I like our odds, and that's an understatement. - Does that mean you guarantee a victory? - You got that right. - This must be a special occasion, though, playing against your brother. - I'd say it is. - Any special advice for him since this is his first championship game? - If he's smart, he won't try to put one past me. - [Reporter] Have you talked to him? - I did. I left him a message, and this is what it said. If we don't win, I will walk down Peachtree Street wearing my brother's jersey in a pink tutu. All right, hey thank y'all. Excuse me, thank you. - Thank you so much. - Oh, hey, you know what? And I'll shave my legs. Quote that. - We're gonna hold you to it. - Jack Davis style. - What the hell are you doing? Hm? Use your brain. You are embarrassing yourself. And your family. Cut the crap! (soft music) (soft music continues) - Hey, hey. - Hey. - Hey, hey, hey, our favorite spot. - Yeah. - Always loved it here. Ooh. - So, how was practice? - Good, it's good. We're just two days away from the big game now. - Jack, you've been acting so nervous lately. Is it the game? - Have I? No. No, I'm good, don't worry about me. - I love you more than anyone else in the whole world, but I do worry about you. - Wait, what's the matter? - Nothing. I ... Anyway, I think you'll agree with me that the people who care about you the most just want what's best for you. - Sofe, why are you saying all this now? - No reason. - No, you're making me feel a little weird. - Never mind. It's, it's, it's nothing, okay. Okay, before we eat, there's something I wanna show you. - Okay. Wait a second, wait a second. Before you play anything actually, there's something that I wanted to tell you. You know that I love you and I care about you more than anything, right? - Of course. - Okay. - Oh my God. - I believe that everyone gets one person, right, who's meant for them forever and, I've known for so long that, for me, you were that person. - Oh my God (laughs). Jack, I'm in shock. - I know, I know. Look, I promise to love you more than anything. Will you marry me? - Oh my God. - It fits perfectly. - It's so beautiful. - So, will you? - Yes. - Yeah? Yeah. (lips smacking) She said yes! - Yes, but, Jack, you've made incredible progress and I'm so proud of you, but we both know that there's still a lot that we have to work on before this marriage thing. - Yeah, no, I know, and I promise that I will do whatever it takes. - This is the perfect time to show you what I wanted to do. - Yeah. - So, our song (laughs). I know how much you always loved when I sing in Spanish. (gentle guitar music) (gentle guitar music continues) (Sofie singing in Spanish) (singing continues) (singing continues) (singing continues) (singing continues) (singing continues) - What the hell? - Jack, okay, don't get upset. It was my idea. - Look, Jack, I have to talk to you. - Wait, you did this? - Don't blame Sofia. I called her. I said I had to talk to you. - No, after what you said at the house, there's nothing more to talk about. - Jack, you can't continue on like this. - I can't even my own engagement without you screwing it up. What's wrong with you? - Just take a walk with me. Just a walk. - And how could you be a part of this, huh? Thought I could trust you. - That's not fair! - Thanks for trying, Sofia. - Sorry. (soft music) (bike banging) (door slamming) - Hey, man, is this Wally? Yeah, no, it's JD. I didn't know if this was still a good number, you know. I know. It's been a while, huh? You saw the game. That's really cool, man. You know, I was wondering if I could get together with you, you know, run it back like old times. Sure, uh, I can head over right now. (Jack breathing hard) (soft upbeat piano music) (soft music continues) - [Wally] Who is it? - Hey, do you know if this is still Wally's spot? - Wally who? - I don't know. - You don't know my last name? (laughs) JD, man, it's me, Wally, man. Look, check it out! - Oh wow. - Yeah, it's the long hair, do you like it? Come on in, come on in. You don't recognize me? - No, I did. - Oh man, it's the long hair and the beard. You hate it, don't you? - No, it's, it's different. - Man, you know who likes it? The ladies (laughs). This place is like crawling with women. Well, Tuesday nights mostly, but that's when we have free hallucinogens night. I'm just kidding. I don't touch the stuff. What do you think about the place, man? - It's, it's cool. - Yeah, I did some redecorating. Check out my new art, man. I've been taking classes. - Yeah yeah, I haven't been here in a while. - It's been like two, three years. I thought you didn't love me anymore. You wamt the old stuff or something new? - No, the old stuff. - Here's your old stuff. Here's something new. That makes you feel like you can fly, to the moon. (Wally laughing) (knocking on door) What you, what you bring a friend? - No. - Okay, I'm sure it's nobody. Hold on to this. - I actually gotta get going. - Yep, yep, yep. Oh no! - What's up? What's up? - It's the cops! Shut the door, run! (Wally panicking) (soft upbeat piano music) (siren blaring in distance) (soft upbeat piano music) (siren blaring) (police radio chattering) (siren blaring) (police radio chattering) (soft upbeat piano music) (Jack breathing hard) (train whistle blowing) (train clattering) (engine humming) (door closing) (footsteps scurrying) (keys jingling) (door slamming) (Jack breathing hard) (soft piano music) (piano music continues) - [Sofia] Jack, it's me. I hope you're okay. I'm just really confused right now. I was just trying to make things better. You know that. You and me can't go on like this. Good luck tomorrow.

Yeah, like, it's a long story, Eddie, all right. - So breaking news that's just come in. Our sources telling us that legendary coach Harrison Davis is set to announce that he'll retire at the end of the season. - Hey, Eddie, give me a second. I'll call you back. - I'll make this brief. I am hereby announcing my retirement as head coach. Effective immediately after tomorrow night's championship game. I'd like to thank my friends, family, and all the fans, on both sides of the pond, for their support throughout the years. It's been something. I will not answer any questions regarding this matter until after the game tomorrow. - Well, the rumors were true. Legendary coach Harrison Davis has announced this will be his last season. What a career. Winning the World Cup, a hall-of-fame professional player in England, and then in the US. A coach in England, and then in the US. He became the majority owner of the Carolina team. What a life in soccer, the last 17 seasons with this Carolina franchise. - [Kevin] That's right, Dave, it certainly will be interesting to see how it affects the team. And remember, he's coaching one son against his other son. It's gonna be much more than a regular game. (gentle music) (engine idling) (gentle music) - Hey, um, I could really use a friend right now. Yeah, I'm at that park behind the stadium. I'll see you. (engine idling) - Yo. What's going on? - I can't go in there, man. - What do you mean you can't go in there? - I don't know. I, I don't think I can. - What's going on? - I don't know, man. I keep having these like episodes where I, I can't do anything. I feel like I'm drowning, and then ... It's just terrifying, man, because I don't know when they're gonna come or how long they're gonna last. It's just too much now, man. Everything, it's too much. - What's everything, the game? - Everything. Everything, Sofia, my father, the game, my career, my dream. Literally everything. - Okay. Can you try something for me? Where are we right now? - Park. - We're in a park. Your father's not here. The team's not here. The game's not even here. We're just sitting here talking. Win or no win, you are still my best friend. - Yeah, but it matters if I win. - To who? - Everyone. - We been doing the same stuff for years. And the only people it matters to is us. You could be selling T-shirts in Tahiti, man. I don't care. The only thing that you have to do right now is go in there and play a game, if you want to. The only reason you've gotten this far is because you wanted to. I didn't do any of this. This is all you. If you don't go in there, I'll have to go in there and try and play for you. And I don't think I'll do as good of a job. (gentle music) I'll see you in there. If you don't, you'll regret it for the rest of your life. You'll hear me from the first row. (gentle music) - Kevin Egan alongside Dave Cohen. We're set to go for the championship game between Georgia and Carolina. And, Dave, safe to say we've never really seen a storyline like this one. - Absolutely, Kevin, in fact, they're dubbing this one the Family Feud. Carolina, with owner coach Harrison Davis, goalie Sam Davis, as Carolina goes for a record fifth championship. And they'll have to beat the other son, Jack Davis, a star striker and a late-season signing for Georgia, who will hope to try and take the Wild to their first-ever championship victory. The wait is over, as we kick off the championship game. Now Davis with an early touch. And he's not really moving, Dave. - [Dave] Yeah, he looks listless. He might be having some kind of issue, and now he goes down. - Jack, what the hell's going on? Let's go! - [Kevin] Good news for Georgia. Jack Davis is back on his feet. - [Dave] Yeah, and only in his second game, he's become a critical cog in the Wild's revitalized offense. - [Kevin] Certainly helping them combine here as Georgia go on the attack. Up against the reigning champions in Carolina. Can Briana Scurry's team cause the upset? Sam Davis watching on. The ball pushed wide for Mendy. Mendy delivers beautifully, for Jack Davis with the header! Into the grateful palms of his brother Sam. - Just like old times, Jack (laughs). Just like old times. Jack, Jack. - Hey, we made it. How's he doing? - Okay. - Woo! - [Kevin] Closing stages of this first half. Georgia surprisingly brilliant here in this championship game against the champions, Carolina. On the attack they go again, with the instrumental Jack Davis. - Go left, go left, cover! - [Kevin] Chance for Davis! Once more his brother standing in his way. - All right, Jack, all right, next time, Jack, next time! (soft piano music) - How are you so bad? We have the same genes. (soft piano music) - [Dennis] Watch the gap in the middle. - [Kevin] The first goal yet to be scored as Carolina ... - In middle, in the middle. - [Kevin] Go on the attack through Luis Rojas. - Come on. - [Kevin] He meanders his way through. A little shimmy and a shake. Rojas with the goal! Against the run of play, Carolina have scored! - [Dave] Oh, Kevin, this is gonna be so demoralizing. The Georgia Wild has played so well, above expectations, only to give up a goal late in this first half. - [Kevin] This now a huge test of character for this Georgia Wild side. Can they find a way back into it against Harrison Davis and the champions from Carolina? (crowd murmuring) (soft dramatic music) - Anybody feel like putting a ball in the net tonight? Hm? How about we score a couple goals, maybe one goal? Jack, can you not let that asshole brother of yours get in your head? - Hey, leave him alone. He's the entire offense. We're all out there trying. - I see that we're trying, but it's not good enough. It's not cutting it. - We're down by a goal, and we're fighting each other? Rolling over and dying is exactly what everyone in that other locker room expects you to do. As far as I see it, you have two choices. You can either accept losing and the labels that other people put on you, or you can take your destiny in your own hands and get to work. You have 45 minutes to show everyone what you're made of, to leave it all out there on the battlefield, for yourselves and each other. Now tell me, what's it gonna be? (soft music) Are you warriors? - Yeah. - Bring it in, come on! (players clapping and cheering) - [Dennis] Get in, get in. - Who are we? - [All] Wild, Wild, Wild, Wild! - Wild, let's go! - Come on, boys, let's go! Let's go! (players clapping) - Can we do this? - Yeah. (Harrison sighing) (Jack clearing throat) - Aren't you in the wrong locker room? - I'm not here as a coach. I'm here as a father. Have you got any idea how hard it is to watch what's going on out on the field? - What are you talking about? As long as we don't score, you get that record championship you always wanted. - A father whose son is suffering. Trust me, I'm suffering as much as you are just watching it. Screw the fifth championship, if it comes to that. - Screw the fifth championship, really? - You're damn straight! - Are you really done? - Yeah. Yeah, I'm done. I tried to call you before it came out in the press. - I know. I saw the messages. I figured it was a stunt, that you'd never stop coaching. - Me too. - So then why are you quitting? Dad, is, is something wrong? - Yes there is. That's the other thing I wanted to tell you before. I've been diagnosed with MS. - What? Like multiple sclerosis? - It's a process that's gonna take some time. So no more coaching. - Dad, I'm so sorry. I didn't know. - It's okay. It's all right. I'll deal with things as they come. Listen up. This is your time now, Son. You really deserve it. - [Creekmore] Jack, Coach needs you. - Yeah, I'll be right there. - That makes two of us. (gentle music) Yeah. - Yeah. (Harrison exhaling) - [Kevin] Deep into the second half, Georgia looking for that equalizer. It's Carolina leading by one. Wave after wave of Georgia attacks. Here they go with Jack Davis with the cross. - Watch Jack right there, watch it! - [Kevin] Sam Davis just marshaling that back line, but the ball falls now for Liam O'Brien! The game is level! - [Dave] Oh, we talked about the curious letdown right before halftime, but now we're all even! It is anybody's game. - Oh my God, they got one. - [Kevin] The match level at one. Georgia possessing brilliantly. And, Dave, look at Carolina, the champions, sitting so deep defensively. - [Dave] Kevin, Georgia's pressure has been relentless. - [Kevin] Credit to Briana Scurry and her team, now looking to carve out that big opportunity. Davis high and wide, nowhere close. - All right, Jack, all right, next time, Jack, next time! - [Kevin] Final few seconds of stoppage time. Is there one more attack from Georgia? - Go back, go back! - [Kevin] Jack Davis, inside the penalty area, thrown to the ground. Knocked down by his brother Sam. - Ref. - [Kevin] And the referee has a big decision to make. - Come on, Ref! That's a PK! - [Kevin] Georgia wants a penalty. And the referee wants another look, so he'll head to his monitor. - It'll be okay. Don't worry about it. Don't worry about it (laughs). - [Kevin] What an ending to this match. Sam Davis is confident he did nothing wrong. Jack Davis wants a penalty. What will the decision be? (whistle blowing) - Are you kidding me right now? Are you blind? - [Kevin] Penalty! - Are you blind? - [Dave] Whoa, a penalty kick is coming up. Now the question is ... - Are you kidding me? - [Dave] Who takes it for the Georgia Wild? - No, you know that please. Okay, okay, that's fine. - [Dave] Sam Davis in goal, and it looks like his brother Jack will get the opportunity. We told you at the outset ... - Here we go. - [Dave] We've dubbed this the Family Feud. - Come on, Jack. - Yes, come on. - [Dave] Now, 12 yards separating Sam Davis and Jack Davis. The penalty kick could decide this. How can coach Harrison Davis bear to watch his sons Sam and Jack in this decisive moment? - [Kevin] And Coach Davis removing the iconic cap worn by his father, also a legendary coach, Harrison Senior. He's worn it every match since his father's passing, and is this the final walk for Coach Davis? - Coach. - Coach. - All right, guys, here we go! Go! (gentle music) (crowd cheering) - [Kevin] So here we go. What an ending to this championship match. Brother versus brother from 12 yards, and every other play will jockey for position in case this ball stays in play. Jack Davis, this his first professional penalty kick. And you know, you just know, these two brothers have been in this position before. - [Young Sam] Look at me. - [Mother] Come on, boys, dinnertime. Right now, it's gonna get cold. - Just a second, Mom, we'll be right there. - Don't give me that we'll be right there, Mom, stuff. - But, Mom, this is for the world championship. - Okay, since it's for the world championship. - You'll never get one past me. (soft dramatic music) - Remember, Jack, visualize. (soft dramatic music) (hands pounding) (soft dramatic music) (soft upbeat dramatic music) (soft upbeat music continues) (Jack kicking) (soft upbeat dramatic music) (soft upbeat dramatic music continues) (Jack kicking) - [Kevin] Goal! Jack Davis scores! With that, Georgia Wild have won their first-ever championship. - [Dave] I've seen a lotta game winners but never one like this! The goalie saved it, it deflected off the post, ricocheted back to Jack Davis for the game winner! - [Kevin] What a goal and what a match! An instant classic. - Did you see it, Dad? - Let's go, let's go! Yes! - [Sofia] Oh my God! - Yeah, well, I guess it was just Jack's turn this time. (crowd cheering) - You hear it? You picked a hell of a night to get one past me. - Yeah, well, better late than never. We good, man? - Yeah, I'm good. (soft music) How's it feel to be a champion? - I don't know, man. It's still settling in. Sure as hell beats being a champion of frustration. You know, I can't wait to kick your ass next season. - Ha ha, I look forward to it. - Where did that come from, man? What, you laid him out without me? - I was waiting for backup. - You didn't need it, man. Come here, dude. - Thank you, man. Thank you. - Yeah, go have fun, come on. (soft music) (crowd cheering) - Holy shit, can you believe it? - The best, craziest decision I've ever made. - Thanks, Coach. - My pleasure. You were awesome. Yeah! - Incredible game! Dude, that was awesome! (Eddie screaming) - You did it. - We did it. - No, you did it. Remember this. Oh my God! Are you kid, look at this! (soft music) (Harrison chuckling) (crowd cheering) (gentle piano music) (piano music continues) (piano music continues) - Oh. - I'm so proud of you. - Thank you.
