[music playing] [singing christmas carols] [laughter] Now, matron, we mustn't keep Santa Claus waiting. Santa Claus! Santa Claus! [singing christmas carols] Merry Christmas. Oh, Countess! Merry Christmas, [inaudible]. But Countess! Merry Christmas, doctor. You have no right to be here! You can't keep me out of this. But... Me, I've never been fond of children's Christmas parties, - and I'm [inaudible]. - But... After all, this is much my nursing home as it is yours. - But... - Or hers. Well, nearly as much. Of course it is, but you have just had a very serious operation. Whose fault's that? It was you who kept on about my grumbling appendix. Grumbling appendix, indeed. I believe you invented the whole thing. [singing christmas carols] [inaudible] Happy Christmas. Happy Christmas, Jean. Happy Christmas, Francois. May we see mother? We'd like to show her the cake. Oh, I'm sure it'll be all right. Miss Cavell's not about. She's not supposed to know this. Yes, I know, Jean. She's in the children's room. I'm sure it'll be great. Thanks. Matron, the Countess has called. Countess? Yes, she's with Dr. Depage in your sitting room. [inaudible]. [inaudible], the cake is here. Would you like to see it? Look. Jean made it all by himself, didn't you, Jean? Good boy, Jean. [inaudible] I made the icing. Countess, what are you doing here? I'm walking. Merry Christmas. I told her to rest, but she's [inaudible]. Oh, stuff and nonsense. Clear off. Clear off. I don't need you. Who's is that? Madame [inaudible], Suzanne. She's quite a character. Do come here. Want to go to the Countess? Would you [inaudible] come to Madame? Matron, could you come to the small ward at once, please. I have to go and see young Madame Rappard. She's very poor. I may need you doctor. The excitement... the boys were here. They have a surprise for you. A cake for the children starving. And she wanted so much to see it. I'm not supposed to know. I understand. Don't spoil it for them. No, I won't. Merry Christmas, children. Merry Christmas, [inaudible]. [cheering] Waiting for you. Please, go. [SOFTLY] Stay with her yourself. Send down if you need me. Yes. [children cheering] What a beautiful cake! This is you, I suppose. It was Madame Rappard's idea, wasn't it, Jean. Yes, mother wanted to thank you. We all did. How very kind. Is it as good as it looks? Would you like to try it, Miss Cavell? I think you better cut it, Francois. [music playing] Oh. Your mother, rest her soul, would be so proud of you. Thank you, grandmammy. Oh, goodbye, grandmammy. Don't worry. It'll soon be over. Goodbye, Francois. Be sure and take care of grandma and the shop. Of course. Look, Jean. My first bake! Ah, it's as light as a feather! Don't worry, [inaudible]. Keep [inaudible]. [music playing] Goodbye, Jean. Be brave. Be brave! [music playing] [scream] Madame [inaudible]! Madame Countess, why don't we go before we are all killed! Leave the Chateau? Certainly not. Nothing would induce me to. [bomb sound] Madame la Countess, Madame la Countess! Stop making a noise like a stuck pig. Charlotte, pick up that bell. [FEARFULLY] All right, Madame la Countess. Straighten the picture. You know how I hate crooked pictures. But what is the use? In a few moments we will be all dead! It would only be anticipating the inevitable by a few years. [bomb sound] Albert... Yes. The picture. The picture. [music playing] They're only a few miles off. [inaudible]. Did you hear what [inaudible]? Burning the village and killing the wounded! [loud] They are [inaudible]! [music playing] Your poor mother, rest her soul, would rather you'd been born blind than to have you look on such a sight. [music playing] [soft music playing] Good evening, Madame Rappard. Matron, I am glad to see you. I'm so worried about Jean. Why, what's happened? They said he's been captured by the Germans. Madame Rappard, you musn't believe all you hear. Brussels is so full of rumors. Yes, but they say they're shooting all the prisoners. [inaudible] Jean! Oh, Jean! [inaudible] [inaudible], my boy. I was captured, but I escaped. They saw me in the square and they're after me! Don't let them catch me! No! Atten hut! Madame Rappard. [german word] hut! Quick! Quickly. Oh. Oh. [inaudible]. [speaking in german]. Ah, English. I am. Who lives here? This lady. As you see, she is not very well. Are there any questions I can answer? We are building troops. How many she take here? Four. Jean. They are building soldiers in the house. Keep very quiet. [speaking german]. Madame Rappard. Madame Rappard. [speaking german] Where [inaudible]? You have to be very brave. They're building soldiers in the house. Oh, what are we going to do? What are we going to do? Now, don't worry. But they'll be sure to find him. Keep him hidden until after curfew. Get some of his old things together, and I'll come back and take him to my nursing home. Oh! Oh, God bless you! [bell ringing] [dog barking] Fraulein, do you know it is past curfew? I do. You should be in your house. I'm on my way to a very urgent case. [bell ring] We might be able to get him away. One of the soldiers is asleep in there by the stove. We must try. Is everything ready? Yes, he's got his clothes in there with him. Come along then. [loud noise] Oh. What happened? Oh, I've taken every bit of skin off my knee. That's what comes of having a horde of men in the house. Oh. Oh. [music playing] Reported numerous escapes. Prisoners of war from temporary camps. Probably seeking refuge in Brussels. Immediate action demanded. Captain, you will take the necessary steps to apprehend any refugee soldiers and advise the civil population of the penalty for harboring them. [inaudible] What is it? Search all houses. And if you find anyone looking suspicious, arrest him, and report immediately to your sergeant. I'm one of the lucky ones. If you can see some of the others lying wounded in trenches and shell holes. If you can only do something for them like you did for me. We have to think of you now, Jean. We must do something quickly to get you out of Brussels. Miss Cav... Miss Cavell. I must see her at once! I'll call [inaudible]. Will you wait in the sitting room? [inaudible]. Oh! Oh, my dear! They're making a house-to-house search for the prisoners! Oh, sister. Please return to the ward. Now, what is it? Soldiers. The soldiers, I heard them talking. Madame Rappard, you must keep calm! Where is he? Where is he? He's quite safe. He's up in one of the small wards. Oh, they'll be sure to find him there! They'll be sure to find him there, [inaudible]. You must rest quietly. I'll bring him down and we'll take him to the cellar. Oh, yes! Yes, um, that will be much safer! Halt! [speaking german] [inaudible] Go there, Jean. Over here. Now bolt the door inside and don't open unless you hear my voice. Yes. Wait! Listen up. Help me with this. [speaking german] [music playing] [inaudible]. You cannot go up there without the permission of the matron. What is it, sister. They say they have an order to search the home for escape prisoners. Very well, they will search. [inaudible] [music playing] Good evening, Madame [inaudible]. Why, Mason, what brings you here? Is there somewhere we can talk quietly. Why yes. Down in the cabin. There's only my good for nothing husband cooking supper down there, and you know him. That's as good as being alone. You remember Madame Rappard? You mean that poor thing in the bed next to mine who left those two nice boys? It's about the older boy Jean. He was taken prisoner but he managed to escape and make his way back to his grandmother. I have been hiding him, and now I wonder would you help by taking him across the frontier into Holland? Of course I will. When will he be here? We're due to leave at 7:00 in the morning. Oh, I'll see that he gets here. And when you're across the frontier, would you send this card just to let his grandmother know that he's safe. Of course, I will. [bells chiming] God bless you, Miss Cavell. [music playing] Jean! We're at the frontier. They'll search. Keep quiet. What happened [inaudible]? Oh. In there? Oh, cognac ala masa moulya. Well, how about one? [speaking german] Bottoms up. [speaking german] You're welcome. Oh, Colonel. Would you be an angel and post this card for me? What? You post the card for me? Oh, yeah. [speaking german] Yes. Thank you, General. [music playing] Madame la Countess! Madame la Countess? [inaudible] What is. What is. [inaudible]. They must have caught them hiding in the woods. What are they doing with them? The... They're going to shoot them! Madame la Countess! [speaking german] Don't be a fool, Charlotte. Of course they're not. You don't shoot prisoners of war. [gun shots] [inaudible], you hear? [inaudible] You foul brute. You're a disgrace to your uniform. You hear me? Do you understand what I'm saying? I can't speak very much your language. But I know what you say. Then why did you do it? Why did you do it? It was commanded. You mean... oh, my God, [inaudible]. That's horrible! Madame, war is horrible. They were in civilian clothing. According to the log of war, that makes them spies. They shot them. I never thought I'd live to see such things. Horrible. Everywhere, all over the countryside they're hiding out in barns and ditches. Most of them wounded, sick. Charlotte, told me that if you go to the far side of the woods you can hear them moaning, crying for help. Is the matron in? Yes. Can I see her? Oh, I have such good news for her. Well, I'm sure she'll see you, Madame Rappard. Thank you. He's safe! He's safe! I just got the card! Oh, God bless you. God bless you. Oh, Madame la Countess, she saved my boys' life. God will bless her. [crying] God will bless her. [music playing] JEAN [VOICEOVER]: I'm one of the lucky ones. You can see some of the others lying wounded in trenches and shell holes. If you can only do something for them like you did for me. MADAME COUNTESS [VOICEOVER]: Charlotte told me that if you go to the far side of the woods you can hear them moaning, crying for help. [music playing] [inaudible], an angel from heaven. Not quite, but I'm well on my way. Snatched from the jaws of death, I called it. [inaudible] you'll be quite safe in the ward as civilian patients. And then we shall arrange to get you into Holland. I'm afraid it will be some time before you can move, though... your foot is septic. Go on, is it? Yes. [inaudible]. Bungey, the name is, Miss... Private Bungey of the East Kent regiment, commonly known as the Buffs. We'll have to be especially careful, Bungey, or your English will give you away. Ello, ello, ello. Woah. Careful over the cobbles, cabby. Yes, it is a little unsteady, but the Countess has never driven an ambulance before. Oh, I see. Blimey! Oh, sister. I have four cases outside I wish to isolate in a small ward. Will you see that it's made ready? Yes, matron. Um, there's a villager to see you. I'll deal with that later. But the officer said it was urgent. - Officer? - Yes. He's a German officer. He's in your sitting room. What is his regiment? He didn't say. He said he wished to speak to you personally. Very well. I will see him. Attend to the ward, sister. Yes, ma'am. An officer has called to see me. Drive around the back of the house and wait for me there. Madame Cavell? I'm Dr. Gunther of the Army Medical Corp. We are transferring the first contingent of our wounded here today. You will remove all civilian patients to their own houses. All Belgium, French and British wounded must be handed over to the German authorities. Very well, Dr. Gunther. They're bringing German wounded into the home. Well, what are we going to do with these men? We can keep them down in the cellar for a few days. That's where I keep Jean Rappard. All Belgium and French soldiers hiding in the town are to be delivered up as prisoners of war. They don't know us yet, Madame Rappard. They don't know us yet, [inaudible]. Remember [inaudible]? What are you looking for, my friend? They've rolled into [inaudible]. How many? Four. [music playing] [gasping] I'm afraid it's hopeless. Just a few minutes now. Poor boy. So young. [speaking german] What is he saying? He thinks he's a prisoner of war. He wants to be set free. [speaking german] You shall be free. [speaking german] Very soon now. Sorry if I'm late, ladies. Oh, no, Madame la Countess. We were learning. Eager for your work, eh? Yes, indeed, ma'am. Good. He's sleeping. If I can be of any help, please don't hesitate to send for me. Thanks. What is it, nurse? The Countess is here. She's in your private sitting room. I have to go down to the small isolation ward first. Please stay here, nurse. Some friends have promised to help and we're making plans to leave. Tomorrow night, I hope. Use the identification cards coming through. [speaking french], bien. Merci. How about me? Oh, no Bungey. You must wait until your foot is better. I thought you said it wasn't skeptic anymore. No, I didn't, but you'll be too dangerous for the others. I'm sorry, Bungey. Good night. Bonsoir. [inaudible], Bungey. [inaudible] Good evening, Countess. Only three of the men will be leaving. The English lad is not fit for the journey. He must go later. Were you able to get the identification cards? [inaudible] Madame Moulin, when can barge will leave? Whenever you wish, matron. Tomorrow night then. And Madame Rappard, is everything ready? Everything is ready, matron. Francois will guide them to the back. Francois will watch the back of the house. You will watch the front. [bells ringing] Courage, Madame Rappard. You have your identification cards? Oui Madame la Countess. [knock on door] [inaudible] Four men [inaudible]. All clear. Follow your instructions implicitly and you'll soon be out of danger. Bon voyage. [inaudible] [inaudible] Well, Bungey, your turn. Don't think so, [inaudible]. Unkind word and I shall cry my bloomin' eyes out. Would you be an angel again, [inaudible]? [speaking german] [music playing] Gentlemen, the new military governor of Brussels, [inaudible] General [inaudible]. General, [inaudible], head of the political department [inaudible]. Captain Heinrichs, Chief of the [inaudible] espionage. Lt. Schmidt, [inaudible]. Captain Heinrichs, [inaudible]. Captain Heinrichs, you are head of [inaudible]. Yavolt, Excellence. Will you look at that. Would you mind, Excellence, tell me how this came into your hands? It was taken from a derelict Belgium soldier who was captured last night on the outskirts of Brussels. But Excellence, this should have come directly to me. I have given instruction that all papers referring to the traffic of escape prisoners and derelict soldiers shall pass through my hand. [inaudible], Excellence... I want no argument, Captain Heinrichs. I have been sent to [inaudible] to restore discipline amongst the population and the [inaudible] occupation. And I mean to do so. This traffic and escape prisoners has been going on long enough! I am convinced there is an organization behind it. This map is the clear proof. Unravel this, and we'll get to the heart of your organization. [singing] One of these days, I suppose these simple Germans will wonder, if no other cargo goes over the frontier, [inaudible]. [inaudible] poker player, I'd say we had a full house. Patrick Doland? Yes, ma'am. Issac Rosenthal? Yes, [inaudible]. James Colsac? Ey, [inaudible]. What about me, Miss? Can't I go on the next load? We'll see how you are, Bungey. Oh, I'm all right. Look at me! London [inaudible] it is. It's all right. It's all right. I did it on purpose. [inaudible] Oh, I'm not, am I? Now will all those whose names I've called give me their Army identification card. Good night, you all. Good night. Here. Thank you. You know, [inaudible]. I don't want to grumble, sir. I [inaudible] with a nice square meal after [inaudible]. We're lucky to get in at all. It must be very different [inaudible]. [inaudible]. But what wouldn't I give for a nice pint of [inaudible]. Perhaps [inaudible]. And then perhaps a nice stable kidney pudding with plenty of kidneys and the gravy running all over the base. How many can you take on the next trip, Madame Moulin. As many as you like. I don't think these [inaudible]. There's seven more will be here on Friday. Then 11 must go tomorrow night. I can take them. [inaudible] off and transferred to the German identification cards. Can that be done by tomorrow night? Yes. You, Madame Rappard? It's all arranged. Francois and I will guide you as far as the [inaudible]. And the other boys, we'll take them on the tram [inaudible]. Mama, look out! [music playing] [inaudible]! British! Yes. We must take him to Brussels. Oui. We must hide him. [speaking german] [speaking german] [inaudible], clean up [inaudible]. [inaudible] Edith, my dear, this must be the last. We must stop it. How can we stop? While any of these men are needing our help, we must go on. If one of them should be caught and shot will be our fault. Swab. But we searched the whole wood, Herr Captain and can find no trace of him. Lt. Schmidt. Offer a reward, 500 francs, for any information leading to his arrest, dead or alive. Search every hospital, and instruct all doctors and officers to report any unusual cases. Yavolt, Herr Captain. Lean heavily on me. That's right. [inaudible], but I must get you downstairs. If we meet anyone on the way, don't speak. Ah, Lt. von Schultz. Your promotion is overdue. Donka, el Captain. Now this map indicates a secret organization going on [inaudible] escape prisoners. Yavolt, Herr Kapitan. And I'm relying on you to uncover this entire organization, uh, Captain Schultz. I will earn my promotion, Herr Captain. Madame la Countess. Another one has arrived. [inaudible] is he stable? No, Madame la Countess. This one came to the lodge. He's waiting outside in the hall. Ask him in. Madame la Countess, you have the reputation for being a good friend. Well? I have escaped from a German prison camp. From what prison camp did you escape? [inaudible] What nationality are you? French. What do you expect me to do for you? Help me to get out of Belgium and back into France. I am anxious to fight again for my company. Charlotte, take care of this poor man. See that he has food and drink, and lock the kitchen so that he won't be disturbed while he's there. Wee, Madame la Countess. Merci, Madame la Countess. This way, please. Brussels 9046. This Brussels 9046. May I speak to the chief of police? This is the Countess Mavon. Would you send an escort to the Chateau Mavon at once. I have a French refugee prisoner of war here. I'm keeping him locked in the kitchen until you arrive. Not at all. It's a very great pleasure. Cavell. We're being watched, my dear. I was followed here by the man talking to those workmen. And last night a stool pigeon flew into my [inaudible]. What did you do? Pinched his wings a bit and handed him over to the German authorities. I thought they'd understand the same language. He had the loveliest Franco Prussian accent you've ever heard, my dear. Francois Rappard. One. What are you looking for, my friend? A safe road and a quick journey. Who sent you? Number 33. Read it again. "I have almost earned my promotion, Herr Kapitan. But I have not yet reached the heart of the organization." How [inaudible]? Through Dr. Gunther. Was addressed to him to be delivered here. Where is Countess? At 149 [inaudible]. Oh, let me see. That's the nursing home run by... The English woman, Cavell. I'm sure. [buzzer sound] Dr. Gunther. This note. I found it on my desk. It must have been put there by someone who knows the house. Have you seen anything suspicious here? No, Herr Kapitan. I've carried out the instructions, but I've seen nothing. What about the woman Cavell? She's cooperative and a generous person. [inaudible] she's an English woman and must be watched. Fraulein Cavell. Where does that lead to? The boiler house. I should like to see it. Very well. I will take you down myself. You can hay or sneeze no, man. I don't want to. Now I've gone past it. Fraulein Cavell. A number of escape prisoners have been making their way out of the country. It would be a very serious matter for those who engage in this traffic if they should be caught. Whether they were men or women, Fraulein Cavell, they would incur the severest penalties. It is our duty. It is your duty. Matron, are you all right? So tired. It's too much for you, matron. Why don't you lay down... [inaudible] suspect. These men are in great danger. We must get them away at once. [inaudible], he's not fit to be moved. Send word to the Countess, Madame Rappard, Madame Moulin for tonight. Yes, matron. Now you know the routine. You follow the guide and in pointed groups as far as Moulin. There you will be handed over to the other guide. You have your identification cards? Yes. You know the password, safe road and a quick journey. Now I'll see if all is clear. Goodbye, Bungey. Don't forget your promise. Not a drink till you are safely across the frontier. Nor you, Pierre. No, we won't forget, Miss Cavell. There's other things that I won't forget neither... no [inaudible], none of us. God bless you. Bye. Bye. Au Revoir, Pierre. Godspeed, Jacques. Bonsoir. Bungey. Oh. [inaudible] What's that for? Your supper. Oh. I thought that you wanted me to get inside it. It's a good one. Comic. I'll see you later. Ey. And maybe bring you some cognac. Oh. That's different, isn't it? Here, here, what about Pierre and the other [inaudible]? I'll give them just five more minutes and then we're off. [inaudible]. I wonder what [inaudible]. Fantastic! The whole of the German secret service fooled by a few women! Yes, [inaudible]. And I can tell you more than that. I'm sure you can. You're the clever one. Yes. And shall I tell you something? Yes. You know who I am? No. I am Captain William Schultz of the German military intelligence. How many? One. Madame la Countess, you will come with me to Captain Heinrichs' office. England, and to play some cricket, and to see [inaudible] again. Norridge. Yes, do you know it, matron? It's my home. Give it my love. I demand to know why I've been brought here. You do not know? I do not. You are under arrest for assisting prisoners of war out of the country. Now, all you do is follow the guide and you will soon be safe. Yes, matron. I understand perfectly. Don't you ever want to go back home, not here among all these foreigners? There's only one human race, my dear. Yes, I suppose that's true. What would they do if they found out you had gotten me here? I mean ought'n you to hand me over to them now that I'm all right again? You think I've nursed you back to life to hand you over to be shot? I'll see if everything's ready. How dare you. Officer [inaudible], [speaking german]. Do you know this man? Or this? An informer and the worm. I congratulate you on your friends, Herr Captain. We'll have to go without your identification card. Nothing's gone wrong, matron. Oh, no, no. You have your emergency ration? - Yes, ma'am. - Your money? Yes. Come along then. All clear. Goodbye, Richard. Goodbye, matron. I shall never be able to thank you enough. God bless you. [inaudible] Miss Cavell, I arrest you for harboring escape prisoners of war. [speaking german] [speaking german] I've just seen the signal! We're at the frontier. There's danger. You'll have to swim forth 100 yards upstream, and you'll be safe. You Madame Moulin. I am. You're under arrest. [speaking german] Get your hands off me! I don't like it, [inaudible]. I don't like it. You can get no information from the military authorities. I hear unofficially trial is imminent. If you could establish espionage it would be simple. Yeah. But we have no [inaudible] evidence. But there is an alternative. We can charge her on a Section 58 of the military code which makes furnishing the enemy with men, an offense punishable by death. Go yourself and see the lawyer representing Miss Cavell. Tell him to impress upon the court that she is a woman who has sacrificed her life in all this storm of hatred, trying to create a refuge of goodwill and forgiveness. I will, sir. But you mustn't stress yourself. I will bring out all the points made by your ministry in my speech for her defense. But your presence at the trial would cause a great prejudice. The German judges would feel that you were exercising a kind of supervision. Oh, I wouldn't have that happen. But you will keep us well advised, won't you? Of course. I suppose at the worst it could only be a term of imprisonment. That's the worst. Thank you. Of course, you are the public prosecutor and I have no wish to interfere with your conduct of the case, [inaudible]. Certainly. There may be a [inaudible] of checks [inaudible]... [inaudible] that the military code applies only to Germans supplying the enemy with men. A law which is good enough for Germans is good enough for these people. Of course, we would have been to see you before, matron, if I'd been able to get a permit. Yes, I know. It seems more like seven years than seven weeks since you left. It has been a long time. Everything has progressing quite satisfactorily with the home. Oh, yes, matron. We've been carrying on as though you were with us. That's right. And you'll soon be back again for the directors of Institute have arranged for an advoca... You're not permit to discuss any matter in connection with the trial. Surely, I'm permitted to tell Miss Cavell what... You will discuss nothing with her in connection with her case. That is the condition of your [inaudible] under German military law. That may be all right for Germans, but I'm an American and I think it's... I'm not interested what you think. They can't stop me from telling you an attorney has been engaged for your defense. Mary, my dear, don't distress yourself. It can do no good. It's all so unfair to those of us who know how much good you've done. Oh, [inaudible]. I know just how you feel. GERMAN GUARD [OFFSCREEN]: Fraulein [inaudible]. Sister, take her back and let her rest a while. Yes, matron. We'll come and see you soon. That situation calls for the severest penalty. Pity [inaudible]. Leniency would only be mistaken for a weakness. OFFICER [OFFSCREEN]: The charge then is to be [inaudible] through the death penalty. I wish an example made. The network of conspiracy unravels, but it's still [inaudible]. As far as purpose, the furnishing of soldiers to the enemy. Directed in Brussels by this woman, Cavell, and her accomplices who are here on trial. There has been steady traffic to [inaudible] Germany, and [inaudible] enemies under this woman, Cavell's direction. Men of military age have succeeded in passing the frontier. It remains to be seen whether what has been charged against them constitutes their [inaudible], or whether the true purpose of this organization was that of espionage. [SARCASTICALLY] Espionage. [inaudible] Spying. Spying I wish to call the head of our counter espionage, Captain Heinrichs. Captain Heinrichs. You know [inaudible] Miss Cavell? Yes. Will you produce a statement taken by yourself? I do. The statement taken correct in every detail. It was taken with every precaution. No possibility of error. Is it suggested that this organization existed not only for the purpose of providing the enemy with men, but also for espionage? I have no proof of that, [inaudible]. All of your witnesses has been drawn from military intelligence service. Is there no independent or civilian witnesses? [speaking german] [inaudible], I have one important witness whose evidence alone should be sufficient to convict all the prisoners. I call Francois Rappard. Francois Rappard. Francois Rappard. Francois! Francois! Francois Rappard, do you know the accused, Miss Cavell? Yes. Did you, at the request of the woman Cavell, conduct fugitive soldiers through [inaudible] border? Yes. Did you hear them say that they were going back to join the Army and fight against Germany? Francois Rappard! Did you hear them say they were going back to join the Army and fight against Germany? [scream] Don't tell them, Francois! [crying] [inaudible] I know, [inaudible]. I know, dear. We are doing everything in our power. Yes, we know, Mr. Gibson, and we're very grateful. But we can't understand why they wouldn't allow you to be present at the trial. Her defending counsel said it would prejudice her if I did. But he assured me she would receive a perfectly fair trial, and that he would do his utmost independent and the best of his ability. Let the court put itself in the position of this woman. Dedicated as she had been throughout her life to the service of the helpless. And ask themselves what they would have done in the face of the irresistible impulse to assist those unhappy fugitives whom she had hidden in her house, or given assistance from her purse. Her only motive in acting as she has done was to save men whom she thought to be in danger and help them escape from the country. She never for a moment had it in her mind to do an injury to Germany. The law of Miss Cavell is far above any military code. A law infinitely higher than war and the idea of [inaudible]. The life of that woman belongs to the sick and wounded. The lives that many Germans soldiers owe to her skill in the early days of the war dries out against the shedding of her blood by the German authorities. If what she has done is deserving of punishment, then detention for the duration of the war is the maximum penalty that should be inflicted. Could it be doubted that this organization was a premeditated conspiracy to undermine the German authorities? Was it not plain from the fact that the enemy was benefited and Germany injured by their action? By their breach of law, these people put in danger the lives, and probably cause for death of brave German soldiers in the front line. The head of this organization was undoubtedly the woman Cavell. It will be said that she was a nurse. A nurse has obligations beyond military code. To make use of her calling as a cloak for recruiting soldiers to the enemy was a gross abuse of her noble profession. [german] Miss Cavell, please. Do you wish to say anything further to what has been said on your behalf? I have nothing further to say. You admit having assisted soldiers to cross the frontier? I do. How many of these men did you assist in leaving the country? About 200. Did you know the offense is punishable with death? I did. Against the woman Cavell, I demand the penalty of death. [music playing] The case against the woman Cavell is closed. Sentence will be discussed and put to the vote. [music playing] [inaudible]. Please do not be afraid. He demands the extreme penalty, but they would never carry it out. Thank you. You are very kind. [bell ring] [inaudible] I think we all seem sentimental because she's a woman. Precisely. Is there any thought in your mind this woman was the leading spirit? None whatever. Then there is no more to be said. I confirm the sentence. [inaudible] Have an order drawn up for my signature, directing it to be carried out as early as possible. Gentlemen, good day. [inaudible] Thank you. My dear nurses. Your charming letter gave me great pleasure, and your lovely flowers have made my cell gay. The roses are still fresh. But the chrysanthemums did not like prison any more than I do. Hence, they did not live very long. If you were in my place you would realize how precious liberty is. But I hope by the time this letter reaches you, you will have better news [inaudible]. [speaking german] Fraulein Cavell, I have to read to you the sentence of the court. Judgment given this day by military tribunal of the Courts of Justice Brussels against Edith Cavell, directors of the Berkendael Medical Institute for treason commit in time of war. Sentence, death. We carry it out at dawn. Is there anything you wish? I would like to see an English chaplain. [inaudible], Fraulein. [speaking german] I [inaudible]. Gentlemen, what can I do for you? Will you inform, Mr. Excellency, if the sentence in the Cavell affair has been promulgated? Any information that you are entitled to will reach you at the proper time, Mr. Gibson. I... I understand that. But would you tell me if the court has passed sentence on the prisoner. The court has not yet published its findings. Then I presume no sentence would be carried out until it has been made public. The sentence will be carried out when the legal requirements of the Imperial [inaudible] has been fulfilled. Good day, Mr. Gibson. Good day, [inaudible]. [playing music] [speaking german] Firing squad, you'll meet 5 o'clock tomorrow morning. - Kirk? - Ya. - [inaudible] - Ya. Rammler? May I have leave of parade, Sergeant? I wish to report sick. Yellow fever, Private Rammler? I am... I am sick. There's an ugly word for this complaint of yours. I don't mind fighting, but this is murder. You refuse to be ordered? I do. Private Rammler, you are arrest for insubordination. [speaking german] [music playing] Would you please be seated. I have called Mr. Gibson. This note has just come for you, sir. It's very urgent. Oh, thanks. Oh, Sister Watkins has just called to see you, Mr. Gibson. Better go and see her. She may have news. Mr. Gibson, Miss Cavell has been sentenced to death. What? Yes, and it's tomorrow morning. It can't be possible! I assure you it is so. We were told by the deputy governor, Mr. Gibson. Excuse me, sir. Mr. Whitlock wishes to see you immediately. Wait here, I'll be right back. [inaudible] we're being fooled. Read that. This confirms what Sister Watkins told me. I want to write a note. They're going to kill her, sister. I know it. They can't. They couldn't. If only I weren't tied to this bed! Couldn't have caught it at a worse time, sir. Get that to [inaudible]. See that he reads it himself. Very well, sir. If you will forgive me, I'm a little dazed. I'm distressed to meet you under these circumstances. If there is anything I can do to help. So much to do before my work was finished. [inaudible] Institute, the [inaudible]. It is God's will. God's will. Sometimes so difficult to comprehend. That is what my mother would say if she were here. Will you see that a message reaches her? Tell her that I am quite happy, that I have no regret for what I have done. Oh, Gibson. [inaudible] Your Excellency, I have the honor to bring you a personal note. [inaudible] from my minister. I can do nothing in this matter. But surely, your Excellency, you don't wish me to understand that you intend the sentence to be carried out. I have no say in the matter, Mr. Gibson. Decision rests with the military government, [inaudible]. But your Excellency... The military governor of Brussels is the confirming authority, and no one can interfere. I know, but couldn't... I doubt if the Kaiser himself could do so. You mean this woman is in the grip of your war machine? I mean nothing, Mr. Gibson. When is the sentence to be carried out? I have not been informed. Governor. They've treated you considerately whilst you've been here? Oh yes, they've all been very kind. But thank God for these few quiet weeks before the end. Life has always been hurried and full of difficulties. This time of rest has been a great mercy. [inaudible], Mr. Gibson's here to see Excellence. He's out. His Excellence is out, Herr Gibson. I wish to see him. I'm afraid that's not possible. But this is most urgent. I have a message for him from the American minister. I'll see he gets it first thing in the morning. You know perfectly well, Captain Heinrichs, that would be too late. As the Governor's had a very trying day, Herr Gibson. I dare not take the responsibility of disturbing him. Oh, don't worry about the responsibility. The American minister would take that. Unfortunately, Herr Gibson, this is military headquarters, not the American embassy. I have my orders. Why this is... Mr. Gibson, at the opera. Thank you. [music playing] Please, I'll tell him at the end of this act. But this is my [inaudible]. I must see him immediately. This is the general's own private box. You cannot go in. I wish to see General Von Ehrhardt. He cannot be disturbed. My name is Gibson. I'm from the American Embassy. Please tell him I'm here. Mr. Gibson, [inaudible]. Most irregular I know. But my minister will take the responsibility. What is your business? General, there is a rumor or I have been told that Miss Cavell has been sentenced to death. Yes, sir. Moreover, the sentence is to be carried out in the morning. At dawn. [gasp]. Well, don't you realize what it means if you execute this woman? German will be banded throughout the civilized world. Don't you realize what a terrible disservice you are doing your own [inaudible]? To fail in my duty would be a far worse disservice. The maintenance of good order in Brussels requires these penalties be carried out. The maintenance of order could never require the murder of a woman. Your language is hardly diplomatic, Mr. Gibson. Moreover, it is most inexact. One doesn't apply the term murder to the execution of those who have been very convicted on their own admissions of capital offenses. Tried before a secret tribunal. Denied all communication with her legal advisor. Is that your [inaudible]... I have no wish to discuss the procedure of our German courts [inaudible]. If that is all you have to say, Mr. Gibson. I have much to say. A sense of horror so strong, your Excellency will make allowance. This affair, it all seemed so simple and logical to you. [inaudible] and tragedy. A crime against humanity. You regard is a crime against humanity the punishment of people for a military offenses in time of war? Yes, but your Excellency, a woman? [inaudible] mixed up in these affairs, Mr. Gibson. Very well, then imprison her. Put her out of the way until the war's over. No recommendation to mercy was made. The court has decided to punish her with death. Who knows thy cross before my closing eyes shine through the gloom and point me to the skies, heaven and morning grace, and earth's [inaudible] shadows flee in thy, in death alone abide with me. Amen. [marching] [speaking german]. EDITH CAVELL [VOICEOVER]: I have no fear nor shrinking. I have seen death so often. It is no longer strange or fearful to me. [speaking german]. [music playing] [singing] Standing, as I do, before God and eternity, I realize that patriotism is not enough. I must have no hatred or bitterness towards anyone. [music playing]
