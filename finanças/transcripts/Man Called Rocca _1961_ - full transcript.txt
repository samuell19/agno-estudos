You haven't lost your skills. Everyone has a hobby. What are you doing here? You're homesick? No, I came because of Adé. What has he done this time? He says he didn't do it. Yes, but he's inside. You want me to get him out. Is that it? Just wanted to tell you. It's the same. Involved with the underworld. What was he doing with those clowns? He had a partner. They were running a gambling joint. Partner... He must like it, Adé being inside... You know his partner? A guy called Villanova... He's out of town... Where is he? Dunno. But he left: his girl behind. And he cares for her... Pretty. Too pretty to remain alone. And if she did not behave, Villanova would come back. Fast. Come on, get up. I'm hungry. - What time is it? - Twelve thirty. But I'm meeting someone in the beginning of the afternoon. Beware of draught. Be quick. I'm hungry. Where are we having lunch? Same place as yesterday. Why do we always come here for lunch? I like the place. - Hello. - Hello. What will you have? Same as yesterday. That hot dish. I can't sleep afterwards but it's not unpleasant at all. MY news? Nothing. Adé... is fine? I think so. I'll go see his sister. Good. Where's he from? He's Mexican. You know him well? Not more than you do. What did he tell you? That having you here is a real honor for his place. We should talk a little. For a change. You know a guy called Xavier Adé? Of course. We all know him. Why? Just wanted to know. But... "all"... that's a lot of people. To tell the truth... Villanova knew him better. They were doing business together. Is that all you know? Why are you so much interested in that guy? Let's say, I came here to take care of him. O.K. ... I understand... Tell me everything you know. I saw him only once. But I had guessed their partnership wouldn't last. Villanova found him somewhat burdensome. That's all? I've told you everything. I read the rest in the papers. I really think your friend is not guilty, Mr La Rocca. But it's complicated. The police reports charge him. The corpse was found in his car... and the weapon under the front seat. It's true that such obvious evidence is often bad for the prosecution. You've lived here a long time? Twenty years. Who could have flamed him, in your opinion? Xavier Adé is said to be very rough. Among those people he sees, it's a problem. It attracts police's attention. Someone wanted him dead. Who is that someone? Among his friends, there's only one : his partner. His name is Villanova. His name is La Rocca, Roberto La Rocca. And where is he coming from? I don't know. I met him in Monte Cassino He was playing soldier... I've seen tougher ones than that little fool. Listen, it's quite simple. I won't let him any choice. It's Maud or he dies. I gave you my opinion. You do as you please. The decision is made. Girls are a dime a dozen... and he had to take mine. That's Villanova, Maude's man. The others are friends. Nobody told you? I didn't ask. You thought she was living with her folks... and that she was still a virgin. I didn't try to know. It was good. That's all. You won't feel good at all. All of a sudden. You've been with Maud everywhere in town. You didn't find it strange that she knew all these people? To each one his own life. And your life is screwing other men's women? Especially when they're away. Away or not, it's the same. And what does that mean? It means I like this girl. As for the rest... We are the rest. You're too young. You're not up to it. You'll give us Maud's address and leave town. And you're really lucky... Come on, we're listening. I like the town. And the girl too. You were given a break. You should take it. It's very nice of you. It would be better if this girl came back. You shouldn't have done that. I had to start somewhere... Why did you do that? I had to start somewhere... There are always ways to come to an agreement. I hope from now on we'll get along better. He cared for that girl. It wasn't worm it. You can leave if you wish to. I'd rather have avoided that. But it was him or me. What are we going to do with him? A friend deserves to be buried. You know the area better than I. Try to think of a quiet place. Meanwhile, put him in here. Try to find a hm and ropes. We'll get rid of him at night. - Keep it. - It distorts my pocket. What time does it usually close down here? At about 3 or 4 a. m. It depends. Except Maud, who knew about his business? The both of us. O. K. You'll take care of business as if nothing had happened. You can trust us. See you tonight. I've come a long way and he had said today. If you can wait a little, his partner will be coming... Villanova may have told him about you. O. K. I'll wait. Look at that. It's new, isn't it? Feel with your eyes, not your fingers. On sud: fine fabric, it prints. You've been had once more. They told you it was English. Don't you have a girl waiting somewhere? Giving. - Everything all fight? - Not quite... What's wrong? You see that fellow? He says he's got an appointment with Villanova. I'll talk to him. You wish to see Villanova? I'm his partner. Yes, I have an appointment. My name is Cipriano. A business matter? So? I'm going to settle here. Villanova sold me the joint. You shouldn't be surprised. If you're his partner, you must know about it. Yes, of course. This is not the right place to talk. Your hotel is far? It's nearby. -We should go there. - What about Villanova? - I'll explain everything. I'll be back soon. - I'm washed out. - You don't have to gamble. Well, old boy, you're not friendly tonight. Hey, your suit... What about my suit? - There's a defect. - A defect? Where? At the shoulder... - The shoulder? Yes here... it's puckering. You think so? There's a guy at the door. Never saw him. His name is La Rocca. I'll go. We didn't expect you so early. It's not so bad here when there are people around. It's different. Yes, it looks more cheerful. The trouble is you must close in fifteen minutes. We can't. Give the news. And we'll see. Gentlemen, we're closing in 15 minutes. - What does it mean? - That we're dosing in 15 minutes. We're closing in 15 minutes. - You're crazy. - Last games. - You're joking... - That's the way it is. - No time to recoup our losses. Nothing I can do... What's that mess? I've got orders. Closing in 15 minutes, gentlemen. - But why? We stop the games. Where are you coming from? We haven't seen you around. I don't like gambling. - You're not wrong. I didn't make off tonight. Take this. You'll feel better. Why would you do that? Money comes and goes, you know... Well... thank you. See you around. I don't like it. Villanova would never do anything like that. Keep your luck for tomorrow. No. Doesn't work that way. Open by 100. Come on, gentlemen. At the far end there's a guy who won't accept. I know him. He's a bad one. Look. Some are staying to see what'll happen. We're closing. Who's that guy? You've got lots of friends? They're not speaking. I am. And I'm not going until I've recouped my losses. How much have you lost? A big plate. - One minute. - Leave it to me. We turn a card each. The bigger one wins. If you win, the House gives you your money back. If you lose, you go as you are. You're prodigal. You choose. Don't let him do that. We're even. With this one, you would have won. You had your chance. We don't even know this guy. No one does. Yes, we know him well. You'd better go. Take my word for it. He's right. Come, let's go. Go and lock up. Good night - Good night Don't worry... Your suit is perfect. - I knew it. You thought of a place? - Yes, there are coal mines near Gardanne. Lots of unused shafts. - Is it far? - No, we're almost there. Here, look... Down there. Not a cheerful place. -It will do perfectly well for us. The shaft is further down. Let's have a look. It's deep? It will do. Go and get him. - Come on. Come on, help me. What're you waiting for? - I will spoil my suit. - Who cares? Come on. Good. Let's go back. - If I scrub it, it's mined. - Well, don't scrub it. Come on. - We'll see you tomorrow? - Yes, I'll come... You could have told me you were going away. What are you saying? You could have said you were going. You were asleep. I always fear something happens to you. I'm sure Villanova is back. I know... I saw him. And?... Andi'... He went away again. It can't be true... Yes, it's true. Come on. Time to sleep. At once? I'm only a little man, you know... 'd night. Take this. it's your money. - You got lucky? - In a way... It's O. k. Who's there? - It's me. - Come in. He's just arrived. The young always think they're smart. - Thinking he took Villanova down... - He shot him in the back. So... you go first. I wait a little, get in, pick him out and come back here. - That's it. It will be easy : I'll pat him on the shoulder. - I'm going - O. k. Quiet tonight, isn't it? The guy who was here yesterday has not been back. And it's no loss. He's a rough customer. - Thanks to you. - Yeah, that's right. No one has asked to see Villanova? - No. Great. I've got to go to my club. I won't be long. We'll talk after. You wait for me, O. k. ? - He's got a dub? - Yes, a cellar club. His wife keeps it. - Where? - on Tobano street It's called "The cicada". What? You're packing? You're sure you didn't know more about this guy? I told you he's just arrived. - You're unlucky he is here. - Why? You know him? I've met him. He shoots too fast for me. So you're lying down... - Watch your tongue. - O.k., O. k. it's your dough, not mine. I've got enough dough. And I want to make the most of it. Well, I'll manage on my own... - What are you doing here? - That's your car? - Yes. So what? - Let's go for a drive. - Where? - Don't worry about that. - Where are we going? - To your club, "flue cicada“. I was there. I didn't see you there. - On the way, I met a friend, so... - Yeah, you've got many friends. You've got too much work. You must feel tired. - No I'm not... - You'll tell your wife you both need a rest. - I can assure you... - Tonight, you're leaving on a trip. And you had that idea just like that. All of a sudden. We've got to take the opportunity. Our friend won't always be available. I'm not against it... - Good night Good night... but it is so fast... Believe me... We really need a change of air. They're all leaving town. I wonder why... I like the idea of being in charge of this dub. And it's a good omen. I'm always so afraid you'd leave... Where would I go? I don't know... When do I start? - Tomorrow. - Tomorrow? Say... We've got no time to lose then... You've only got one thing in mind... - You've changed in those 3 years - I'm happy to see you, Roberto. I could not come before. - He didn't do it, Roberto. - I know. But how can we prove it? - You go and see him often? - Yes, every week. Well... when he is not in solitary... - When are you going? - Friday. I'll go with you. You don't need anything? No. Today, no. Roberto's here. He's seen your lawyer. You'll tell him to go away. I don't want him to get mixed up in this. Right, Xavier. You'll also tell him I'm glad he came. How is he doing? All right. Good. But he must go, fight? - Good bye. - Good bye. so? I told him you're here. He wants you to leave. Yes, he's in a fit. All we can do is wait until the trial. Good morning, you're here for the visit? - Yes, why not? Shall we? - Yes. You'll see beautiful things. Here're two tickets. Thank you sir. You've already visited the mansion? - No, no. - It's from flue 17th century. Built in 1664, for the cardinal of Vendome, Governor of Provence. He had it built to shelter his loves with the countess of Corbin. He didn't do things halfway, did he? He was Louis the 14th's cousin. - Well, in that case... - You have a beautiful architecture here. Gentlemen. The court. After answering the questions asked and after deliberating as by law the Court and the jury have decided to give the defendant the benefit of mitigating circumstances. Therefore, the defendant, Xavier Adé is sentenced to 10 years hard labor. You have 3 full days to appeal against this sentence. After the delay has expired... I didn't do it, you morons. What happened to Adé? He was sentenced to 10 years. 10 years? Yes... He was transferred to the penitentiary. What are we going to do? We'll go there to check out the premises When? Tomorrow.. That thing is still working? - Yes Yes - Play... - You alone here? - Yes, why? Much danger. Fights often, no? Hmm. Not that much. And Paul and I, we manage... Paul, no good. Me, help you. And you... help me. What d'you mean? I... poor. You give me money Me give you safety- Ah... I see. Well, I'll think about it... - O. K. ? - Yes... yes... Bye... - Good bye. - Pretty lady. I... coming back tomorrow. Hey? what about the bill? We've got to close. Quick. So... they won't go there any more? No, they say it's too far. - You'll come, won't you? - Oh, I don't know. Come on. What is it? Very beautiful, isn't she? You happy. If you're interested, it's easy... - No. I talk business. You think? - No, it won't be possible. Me not rich enough. Understand? Yes, yes... You think again, maybe. No? - What are you doing here? - Oh, Roberto. I'm happy you're back. What's going on? Tell me. Those guys. American deserters I think. Mean looking. They terrorized everybody around. Quiet down. We'll take care of it. - Pretty boss here? - No more pretty boss. She gone. Now. Boss man. Understood. Well... boss here? I'm the boss. What d'you want? You not know? Pretty boss nut tell? She did. But I'm not paying. So, you've got to go. Now, it's more expensive. Sentenced to 7 years by the Aix-en-Provence court of law. Shootout. Goes to the tailors' workshop. Listen to me. I'm in charge here. And I don't like gang leaders. Keep quiet and everything will be all right. Next. - You've been here long? - Five years. You know Adé? Adé? yes. He's downstairs, at the bags workshop At the moment he's in solitary. He's been in a fight. So, Morin? Not finished yet? Yes, boss. What a jerk. Right... if you need me, you call. See you later. You'll be quiet now? - Hi. - Hello. - Wasn't too long? - No. You're coming back from solitary? Yeah. 15 days. You've seen Adé? Yeah. But not lately. He was not coming out any more. There's a reason? The trustee... A piece of trash. He hates his guts. He forgets to give him food a little too often. And what can it get to? I don't know. But Adé has still got one month to do. - Thanks. - You're welcome. You'll forget I'm the one who told you that, o. k. ? What do you think you're doing? Put that out at once. It's a pity. Alter lunch, it's the best of the day. You will go into detox. In solitary. Come with me. Come on. In the buff. - Done? - Yes, boss. - How long are you staying? - 15 days. Put him in number 5. - What's that? - I was wounded before I was arrested. - You're new here? - Yes. - Yes, boss. - Yes boss. Yes We'll lake care of you. Put him in Nr 8. Hey... you again. Yes, boss. I'm unlucky. So you say. Number 3, right? Take them out. Take them out. No, no, give me this... Out. Out. So... piece of trash... not coming for a walk? Fuck you. Hands out. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. - Hey, what's that? - What? what's the matter? One word and you die. Adé's still alive? - Yyyes. - Call him. I want to hear his voice. Number 6. Number 6. Talk to him as you usually do. Hey... piece of trash. You're not answering. Is what I was told true? You don't give him anything to eat? No. If I don't see him outside tomorrow, I slit your throat. Shove off. And don't forget... I sleep with it. Out. Out? So... number 6? The trustee knows. He'll leave you alone. Try to keep quiet now. Go back to your workshop. He's got the blade now. Treat him well. He doesn't really like you. You can count on me. I hope so. For your sake. When the lights are out, change beds with Adé. No regret about your cozy little cell? I only regret not to have Killed that piece of shit. That would have been a brilliant move. I would have felt better... I'm fed up. I can't take it any more. This place drives me crazy. - I've done nothing. You get that? - So what? It doesn't change anything. Nothing, I know. But we must get out of here, Roberto. To do that, getting in solitary every other day is not the best move. Do your work, speak to no one. Then, we'll Geneviéve will certainly come see me tomorrow. She's changed, hasn't she? Yes. I'd like the both of us to go together. She'll be pleased. What shall I do now? I'm all alone. Listen... You're young : you must think of yourself first. Got that? We'll manage. You don't have to worry about us. And... You won't be alone long. Don't worry. And come as much as you can. Attention.

What are we celebrating? It's an anniversary. - Which? It's been 2 years since I've been lighter on one side. I've found a job - Where? In a clothes shop. The lady's old. If I get on well with her, she might leave me the shop. That would be nice... Yes... And what have you been doing this afternoon? You went out? To see people walking around, I can watch from the window. Pass the mustard. Xavier's gone until Friday. - Where? - I don't know, he doesn't say. Dry me, please. Thank you. - The gentleman wants to ? - Take me to Nevada. - My master is expecting you? - He knows me. It's enough. Let's go. I'm following you. You get a tan faster. You do. You don't get a tan so fast, but you're cute all the same. One of your friends wishes to see you. - Let him come. - He's right here. - Adé. My dear friend. - Hello, Nevada. Oh, you've lost your arm. How unlucky. I lost my two legs... Sit down. - You will have a drink? - No. I'd like to talk to you. - Alone. - Really? Get into the pool, girls. Come on. Come on. Come on. They're nice, aren't they? And what do I owe the pleasure? It's been a long time... - I need money. - Always the same. You haven't changed. How mud. do you need? 4 million. You can't be serious. - I am. Quite serious. You're crazy. Things aren't what they used to be. They're hard times. - I can't get such an amount. - Come on. Stop whining. You'll have a little less fun with the little girls. It'll do you good. Right... we'll go to your office. No scandal. I lost one arm but I'm quite good with the other. Still at the same place? Come on. Open it. And you can't afford it? And this is for your reluctance. - This is not right. - I need that dough. It's not much for you. Don't try anything. Ever. 0. K. ? Or I'll be back. And it won't be for money. Good bye. Hello. Give me Marcadet 3558 in Paris please. - What do you want, Sir? - Adé's in? No, my brother isn't here. What do you want from him? Us? Nothing. Nevada does. He would like another talk with him. Who's Nevada? Never mind. Adé borrowed money from him. And he was quite heavy-handed. So, he would like this money back. Quickly. I'll tell him as soon as he's back. Do that. And to be sure you won't forget, we'll take the lady with us. No, she's got nothing to do with that. She won't go out. Come on, put on your coat and follow me. What's wrong? Look, we've got the house. What's the matter? Where's Geneviéve? Who did that? Who did that? You did. Yes, you did. They wanted you. I couldn't do anything. Can you hear me? Nothing. - Who? - You have no idea? Nevada. Ah, you know. But when you understand, it's too late. He pisses you off, Roberto. Get the hell out. He doesn't want to see you. He can't stand you. Get off. - Poor one-handed man. - Stop. you're going too far. My condolences, sir. Sir. THE END
