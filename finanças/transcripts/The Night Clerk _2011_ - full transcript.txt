His wife called us, not having any news for days. Know, she called me. - Did he stay here long? Three of four days. - Wasn't he supposed to be back? No, don't think so.

Don't know. You tell me. Thanks. Thanks. left an item at the tailor, could you pick it up? You've got one for me? Thanks. Come on, go on. Put it down. You're coming to Claire's? - think I'll find it. Here's the key. Leave it in the glove compartment. Did Mrs. Couvreur say for what occasion? No, think it's for her place. Can you make me one? - For you? The same? Not the same color. like the pink one. Hello - Hello, sir Not bad. Classy, isn't it? You don't like it? - do. Did you put perfume? - Yes. It is... Why do you dress like this? Something special? I'll bring you out. It must be expansive. - No, it's OK. I'm sure the boss will give me a discount. I'd like you to see that. - see, people packed with money. You should see the cash they spend! Hello Julie, alright? The road was clear? Yes. See you later. You're leaving now? - Going training. Say hello to your father, you haven't seen him in three weeks. Don't push me. - At least try to be on time for dinner. Does he confide a bit to you? What's the matter? - Don't know, he's been like this for a while. Every time we come here. When Arnaud was little, Jacques brought him to an Inn a friend was rebuilding up there. At seven, he wasn't interested in the works. That bothered Jacques. When he got back at night, Arnaud wasn't with him. He had forgotten him there. We found him at dusk, somewhere on the work site. He was almost frozen. We're expecting a baby. We wanted to tell you tonight, but couldn't wait any more. I'm so happy, Julie, I've been longing for it. Don't worry, it must be why he's concerned. Men are even more anxious than we are. Do they know at your school? Yes, but don't want to let them down for graduation. I'll take my leave after the practice exams. Some cheese? - Yes. What's wrong? - had a hard week. What did you do? - Three days training on glacier. How high is it? 10500 ft. You camped there? - Yes, that's not the problem. We had shitty weather, the snow was bad. Nobody forced you. - Jacques, please. Stop drinking, it won't change anything. - Leave me alone. Don't get why you come if it's to do this face. Don't come for you. If my coach wasn't here... Who got you out of the shit? Your coach? It's far from over, do you realize? Nothing would've happened if you hadn't sent me there. You're smoking again? Jacques, you have to call Bertrand for Frederic's contract. It's awkward he has a record. Did you hire him? That bothers you? Because he's a delinquent? Why did you do that? We were looking for a courier... It's never been needed here. - What do you know? You're interested in my business now? - Don't start again! Who is he? - A young guy in rehabilitation, that Jacques hired as intern. - What did he do? Nothing serious, small theft. It can't be so small, he went to jail. Why? - He beat the shit out of... a guy who insulted him. Don't make it bigger, he's no criminal. He stayed 3 months in jail. It's good you hired him. See how hard it is for my students to find a job. That's it. Hang in there. Thought you needed strong nerves in you job. Goodbye. - Goodbye, Julie. When do you come back? - don't know, You'll see. Clients don't bother you too much? - No, it's OK. Some are real pain, they'll ask crazy things. It's important not to show anything. "Yes, sir." "Of course, madam." Huh? Apart from that, life is good? You've got a girlfriend? - Yes. What does she do? - She works. In a water bottle factory. You're not from here? - No. I'm from Saint-Etienne. Why did you come here? For the mountain? Not really. had to take a break. Do you go back for family? - No, don't see them any more. Anyway, they're not my family. There you go. - Thanks. Not boo tiring, your job? - No, it's OK. So Couvreur hired you? - Why do you say that? Weren't you supposed to leave at the end of you internship? Gotta go. - So he's also your driver? Aren't you cold, like this? - No. I'm OK. It's your only jacket? Nothing warmer? You dress like this in front of clients? - No, usually don't wear it. We'll ask my wife to find you a coat. I'll buy one. - No. Come on. Come, Frederic. Don't know... This one? Arnaud doesn't wear it any more... hope. Will you try it on? Found this. - He looked for this watch a lot. You're done working? And what about you? - In 45 minutes. Gimme a puff! Do you want me to go shopping? - If you want. I've gotta go. Take some butter. finished it this morning. Why do you stay here? It's a crappy job. Are you stupid? And yours is not shit? Just because you dress like this? Jacques? Hello. Your father wants you to pick him up. - Why? He doesn't want to drive with snow. - He abuses. Don't have time. Impossible. Told him you would. - Let him take his car, it's ridiculous. Would you go? - Yes. If you want. No, he'll complain about the van. Can take my car. - No way. Your car is not in good condition. Hello. - Hello. It's yours. Watch out. Not boo fast. If you mess up, it'll fall upon me. Wear you belt. Why did you go live so far? My wife is from there. She wanted to come after retiring. And it's better not to be too close from my son. We have the same personality, so it makes sparkles. Hello Everyone. - Hello. I'll greet you from afar. I'm recovering from a ?u. He's a good boy. - Everything alright? Leave you. So, how is the sergeant? - It's Lieutenant. Ya, same thing. Well, I'd like to sit. Can't we go up?

Local police already came. Know. Bartod transferred me the case. He's not in charge any more? - No. It's Crime Investigation Department. Was it his first time here, this sir Cassiny? - Yes. Cassany. If I'm right, he's been seen in Andorra? Saw it in the paper. Not seen, only his car and belongings. How did he pay? Don't know, an employee did it. Can see him? - If you want. Do you have a pen? Mine doesn't work. Yes. - Thanks. Actually don't. Means of payment isn't registered. - Some clients pay with cash. He had all this money in cash? Yes. - Did you notice something... in his behavior? No. - Did he look tense? Normal. I'll give you my card. I'd like to question you employees. You never know. Maybe someone noticed something. Come on! No, this way. Oh you're there! Who's this woman? A fool who comes have her dog piss in the park. No. She's from the police. - What does she want? She's investigating about a client... - Who? Remember Cassany? - Of course, he gave me plane tickets and his passport to put them in the safe. This dress suits you well. Disturbing people on the weekend! Couldn't she wait for monday? Didn't you bring wine from the cellar? - Frederic will. Like this kid, don't you? - Yes, but this is a family reunion. Where's Arnaud? In his room? - Yes. think he's coming. How are you, Paul? - Very good. Comfortable in the room up there? - Perfect. So I'll be Great Grandpa because of you? What is Arnaud doing? Thanks, Frederic. Are you going back home? Yes. - With this weather? No. Drink something with us and we'll find a solution. Ask Christine, there must be 2 rooms left. Don't want to disturb. - You don't! Got you mother on the phone. We're getting there with the invitations. Sit down, Frederic. Did you set up a date? - Yes. December the 8. We found a ?at. Where? - In Laubadere. Really? - We won't be the first ones. That's for sure. - What does it have, this district? Tarbes is a quiet city. - Not that much. Are you sure? Can't you find better? It's good for me, next to the school, and it's calm. People exaggerate. Some wine, Paul? - No, thanks. I'd like some, please. What does she want from Cassany? - don't know. It seems he disappeared. He's been seen here for the last time, so she asked informations. What do you mean disappeared? - don't know. Disappeared. Hope they solve that soon, because having the police in the hotel doesn't look good. Toasts, someone? - Yes, I'd like. Would you pick them up? They're in the kitchen. Then you'll go see Christine. Why is he here? - Ask your father. Jacques bonded with this employee. Goodnight. What's going on with this guy? He knows. Did you speak to him? Know he knows. Don't worry, we can trust him. - How do you know? Shit! You're crazy! - Lower! Your mother will hear us. Don't get it. - What? You fucked up. I'm just trying to fix it. That's not hard to get. You don't like it, you leave. Simple. Ya, go away. What's going on again? - Nothing. He's difficult. Not like your employee. What does that mean? You'll make a fuss because told him to sleep here? Wasn't gonna let him drive with this weather. If he crashes, it'll fall upon me. You know what mean. You treat him better than your son. He's a poor kid who's been unlucky. If can make his life better, do it. That's it. I'm surprised you don't get it. - You're all smoking so much. Air! Go to sleep, before your father starts snoring. Hey you! What are you looking for? That's not yours. This coat is mine, give it back. No. - Take it off. Your mother gave it to me. - Are you taking the piss? Ask her. - Shut up take off this coat! Go to hell. - What did you say? Asshole! What's wrong? - Nothing. Don't wanna tell me? Well. You've got no work? - It's my break. You know people walk by, here? Hear me? Will you hurry? Where do you think you are? Stubborn! What time do you leave? - 7 p.m. Are you alone at the reception? - Yes. Hello. - Hello. I'm going. Can see you, later? - Yes. You're well equipped. - Yeah. But still caught a cold. Didn't you bring your dog this time? - No. managed. Sorry for last time, came without forewarning. Yes. Like today. Will you question all employees? - Well have to. Don't see what more they could tell you. It's awkward in front of the clients, you understand? I'll be discreet. What time did he leave? 6:30 p.m, something like that. Was he alone? You went home directly, after? - Yes. Don't you want a glass? - No, thanks. Weren't you at night, before? - was. Why did Mr. Couvreur change your job? Was an intern, and then He hired me with a new schedule. It's for the 12th. For early afternoon. Don't forget to bring the sheets to Claire. It's ready. What's that? - The lost and found, we give them to the Red Cross. It's brand new, this one. - You like it? Take it. Anyway we give it away. Are you stupid or what? Help me carrying stuff for my wife. No! Stop or we'll be soaked. Watch out, think it's fragile. What's this? Never ordered that. It's a gift! Awful isn't it? - Yes. That's for my place, I'll bring it later. Can help you. - If you want. Clients seems to like you, had compliments about you. Thanks. It's an obsession. An estate agency keeps on writing us. You plan to sell? - No. Why? Look what I'm bringing from the kitchen. They're fresh. Smells good. - I'll cook them in a pan. Do you like girolles, Frederic? - Yes. You eat with us? just need 2 minutes. Stay, if you want. You know, that girl, she came back. She even interrogated this poor Jacky, you realize? It starts to be really bothering, this police thing. Let them find him, this Catalan. With a glass of Chablis, It'll be delicious. Serve us a glass? How are you? - And you? What's up? Same old thing. Each time we have an interesting case, Feds take over. She told me about Andorra, where they found his... You think he hasn't been there? - doubt it. Why? Tell me. This all thing is causing me some trouble, with police always at the hotel... He did his last cash withdrawal here. - Yes. So? It doesn't mean anything. - Yes, it does. His last phone call was here too. His mobile has been tracked to localize it, but it wasn't fruitful. The strange thing, is that Cassany's sister lives near Andorra. She couldn't believe he went to the hotel. He usually stays at hers. Do you want something? - No, thanks. Don't get it. Why don't the Spanish police takes care of it? They do. They scrutinized his company accounts, interrogated his associate. Don't you know? - No. Cassany planned to leave him, taking a big part of the shares. He mustn't have been very happy. OK. That's good. What's this car? From your boss? No. It's mine. You got so much money you don't know what to do with it? It was a good opportunity, and bought it on lease. Needed it, other one is rotten. It looks bad at work. - thought you wanted to move. Don't frown. Shall we go for a ride? - No, I'm exhausted. Ya, the car is beautiful. It's silly, but when saw you with this car, thought 'Shit, he starts all over again'. What? - All this money, it's weird. See you trust me. Very pleasing. You put it on! It suits you. Here they are! Bravo! The ?owers! Who do you put there? - Arma Lequet. Dad's never been fond of Arma Lequet. - Oh yes, right. You're father is so happy. - Congratulations. Hi Arnaud. You look good. Leave you. See you later? - Ya. Hi Sophie, how are you? Yes he'll be late. kept a bottle for each of you. Hello. May serve you? - Yes. You're doing good? Here. - Thanks. Enjoy. Can have one please? Sorry, are you from the family? Yes. I'm happy you came. Hi. - Hi. You dressed up. - come from work. You work every week end? - Sometimes. You've the right to have a life, we work and bosses get rich! Not everyone is the same. Aren't you cold? It's freezing. Shall we go? - Why? You just arrived. I'm bored. Very nice. You're fucking nuts. What's wrong? We bore you? We're not good enough? Your keep on repeating, your political stuff bothers me. You've got better to say? You never tell anything. What are you doing? Come on, stop! Frederic. But Fred... What do you do with your bag? Your girlfriend dumped you? Can sleep here, tonight? - I've no room, with all the guests. Yes! Maybe. Come. Didn't know there were rooms here. - We'd have to refit them. We just arranged them for the guests. Here. This one. You're lucky. Arnaud's cousin couldn't come. It's a bit old, but if it can help you... It's nice. - You can stay as long as you want, it's not a problem. - Thanks. You've got a cigarette? don't know where're mines. Can ask you something? know it's not my business, but what did he do to you, the guy you beat? Because of that you had troubles? - He insulted me. Of what? - Of Bastard. Do you know something about your parents? - No. Didn't you try to find your mother? - She doesn't. You don't know. Anyway, what would it change? - don't know. Don't you think it's important to know? Let's drink a glass of champagne. Think they found him. - What? Think they found him. How much time do you leave? - 15 days. Can't you go longer? - No. gotta be back the 22. It's not good. You shouldn't stay around. Wanted to tell you, when the baby will be born, you could find a place nearby, with Julie? It'd be easier, no? - What would do here? What would you do here? Leave. Have fun. Don't worry, take care of everything. Like you did with the cop. - Stop. That's nothing. You didn't do so well, or she wouldn't be looking here. Yeah, that's it, brag. Would've like to see you cope with it without me. You think enjoy it? Yes. Think you enjoy it. Do all of this for you. - Nonsense. You do it for your hotel and reputation. You have a nice opinion of me - Am wrong? Think I'll better go. We're not insulting each other on you wedding day. You're a good dog. Don't move OK? Shit. Alright? - Yes, Thanks. Thanks. Hello. - Hello. Is you father here? - Yes. So you're in the mountain squad? - That's it. Which squad? - PGHM of Pierrefitte. You're going on holidays? - Yes. Happy holidays, then. The autopsy revealed injuries caused by the corpse's transportation. He must have been dragged into the ravine. Which isn't an easy task, knowing the height. Do you see where's Creux Fernel? - Yes. People do ski touring there. Indeed, some skiers found him. They took shelter next to the ravine to eat. Excuse-me. Well... Behind the bar. - Thanks. We found a big wound on his abdomen, caused by a violent shock. It must be a car accident. Well, it's just assumptions. He was real estate promoter. Did you know? - Yes. He was seeking to buy land and hotels for a big hotel chain of Andorra. - This didn't know. He met many owners in the area. Were you in business with him? No. Why are you asking me that? Like that... Do you plan on selling? - Not at all. Say that because learned your son didn't want to take over. Hello. - Hello. You changed your car? - Yes, why? For nothing. Do you have a minute? - Not really. It's been how much time since you got out of jail? It's over now. Yes. Of course. Goodbye. - Goodbye. Come on dog. Let's go. What says the newspaper? - That he had an accident, and they notify his death. Which road is it? The one going up? Don't get it. Nobody takes it. - Higher. They do. My sister in law maybe took it once. This guy must have been shady to be dumped in a hole like that. Did you see the call for witnesses? - Yes. They won't find anyone. There's just 2 or 3 folks taking this road. Can sit here? - So you're there? How can they know it's an accident? They found headlight parts. With this they have everything, the car serial number, the brand, anything. Surprising with all the snow... I'm serious, my brother in law is in the police. They're searching all the garages to find out if someone fixed a car. Hello miss, Can help you? Yes. Hello, I'm looking for Frederic Boissier. Frederic? I'll see if he's available. How did you come? - With Sandrine. She waits for me. So that's where you live? That's what your boss gave you? What do you do for Christmas? There's another girl? - No. So what? That's for me? That's kind. You like it? - love the color. Wasn't it boo tiring? - No, it was alright. Yet we walked a lot. It's so beautiful. Landscapes, the color of the desert. Incredible. Did you take care to bowl the water? - Yes. It was hard to follow Arnaud, he walks so fast. Will he have lunch with us? - He's at the training, he'll be back this afternoon. - He doesn't come say hello? Yes, hullo? Yes, he's here. No he's busy. Tell her it's impossible. Who is it? - Give it to me. Again this woman. She wants to see you. That's enough. My son's just back, we're together. - Give it to me. Yes it's me. Why? No, just what's between the 12 and 17 of October. May you explain to me? Can you give me the safe's key? Thanks. Look at the safe please. Have the right to be informed, no? If you think was in business with this man, you're wrong. Yet you're in the list of the hotels to visit. Incredible. What list? Who gave it to you? His associate. - don't know these people. Have nothing to do with them. Maybe they wanted to buy, but never wanted to sell. Found this. Put it with the rest. Won't let myself get pushed around. - Sorry. That's the procedure. Searching our stuff because a promoter came? Do something. - What can do? Hello. - Hello. You can go. Do you see something? - No don't. Scratches, nothing serious. What is it? - don't know, it must be analyzed. Must commandeer your vehicle. - But my employees need it. Can't help. ls someone driving it in particular? No, everybody. We leave the keys on. Must interview again your employees and family. Can't you leave them alone? I'm getting fed up. You're messing up my season and my hotel reputation. It's not my fault he came here. - I'm just doing my job. I'm working too. You're making me loose my time. Julie? What are you doing in the dark? It's the baby? What's going on? You had some arguments? Where is he? In his room. We didn't have the choice, Michelle. What happened? Don't know. He was on the side, didn't see him. He ran out of gas, he must have gone for some... Why didn't you go to the police? - So that they put him in jail? You realize what it means? - Jacques, it was an accident. How could you do such a thing? Assume Frederic knows? Now understand your little game with him. Happy holidays! Merry Christmas! Look who's here: Miss Santa! Today we have a game, find the animals finishing with the letter E... We have eight answers, wonderful, it's Christmas, so the game is special. Take a paper. Re?ect. As you know, it will be a direct line. Let's go in 5, 4... Can talk to you a minute? - Yes. It would be good tn... Find another place to sleep. Why? - It's temporary. You can't stay here. It's not well accepted by employees. This can't be the reason. It's not safe to stay here, the police will interrogate everyone again. They'll start to wonder... It's better for you too. It's not against you, Frederic. But I'd prefer you find something else. Since when didn't he come to work? Two or three days. Can you give me a glove? Thanks. He lives in Bagneres, right? - Yes. Can you give me his address? - If you want. Can talk to you? We got the report from the experts. So? The front right wing and the headlight have been replaced. It's a clean job, but not done by professionals. The stains in the trunk? - It's not blood. It's wine. Wine? We also found glass fibers. Thanks. You know where you're going? And you? - At my sister's. Don't tell it, OK? Don't go back to the hotel. You fucked me. If you don't go to the cops, I'll go and tell everything. Do what you want. You're a son of a bitch. Why do you do that to me? Don't have the choice. You really fooled me. Give me cash. need it to pass the border. Don't go to the border, there's cops everywhere. Give me cash. - Stop, don't have some. Give me you credit card. - Stop! Now, go away, please. Is there someone? Is it you, Frederic? What are you doing here? - Let me go. When you'll give me the money. OK, but let me go. - don't trust you. Give the money. No. - Come on. Don't mess up. Don't get closer. Your problems are not my business, but don't want troubles with Couvreur. He doesn't give a shit about you. Why do you bitch for a bastard like him? That's the life you want? - Move, you dickhead! Mathieu! - Let me go! He won't go far without car. Does he know the area? You'll have to close the hotel for a few days. Here. Don't move. Don't move. Alright. What did he do? - don't know. Stand. Call the lab. - Thanks If send it tonight it's OK? - Yes. You see where's Ruffange? - Yes. Go to Henry Delemaire, a wine dealer.
