Hey, why did you stopped the vehicles? I've to check. This is Minister's car. That is an Ambulance. Do you've to check these also? Hey, open the gate. Minister's brother-in-law is in a critical condition, open it. Sorry, we won't leave you without checking. Are you a Doctor to check the patient? We didn't mean to check the patient, it's the vehicles. I like your sincerity. Why do you want to check unnecessarily? Keep this as your pocket money. Are you trying to bribe me? No, it's only subsidy, take it. I'm not used to it. Are you a patriotic person? Take it. Stop talking & show the vehicle. Hey, he seems to be a very sincere officer. Show him how sincere you are. Check it. Are you fine? Where? I'm coming right now. Who is this high jump guy? He's jumping like Jackie Chan. She is very shrewd. She seems to be junior Kiran Bedi. Who are you? I am a local Hero. Why're you fighting? To help you... No one needs your help. Sit aside & mind your work. Is it so? - Yes. Hereafter, no Government can save you. Hey, Go man, Go to madam. It seems, she doesn't need help. Don't show off. Turn back & see. Why're you beating us by wearing this uniform? Because, she's counting her days. I'm doing this business for the past 20 years. Like you, do you know how many we had come across? You might've come across many people. Why do you need a belt? That's it. Oh! God! She is screaming. I must stop them before they kill her. Hey, stop it... stop it. Will you also rape her? No jokes, be serious. Leave her & surrender yourself. No jokes, be serious. This is a serious warning you brainless. I told you not to joke, isn't it. Put them into the jeep. Stop. Don't try to take undue advantage of other's credit. What's this? Why're you arresting my smugglers? Your smugglers? So, are you their boss? You stupid. I'm telling you that they're my customers. Look at this uniform & then talk. I don't care about your dress or address. I talk only directly on face to face. Do you know who I am? If this is your dress, then, you are S.I. I'm S.I. of one town. I'm ahead of you. I'm S.I. of 2 town. Why to quarrel between us? We'll make it 50-50. Are they any brinjals to share between us? Rowdies, come to my side. Stop. I beat them first. No, I beat them first. Hey, Who beat you first? Hey, Tell me. Who beat you first? No one beat me. We were smashed in the back. I didn't see, who it was? It was me, you fool. Okay, you beat them. Why did you come to my area & beat them? Because the check post they attacked was in my area. You must've arrested them in your area itself. Why did you arrest them in my area? Because, they escaped & came here. Will they wait for you, without escaping? Why did you come to our area & beat us? I told you not to joke, be serious. Oh! God! He beat me again. If you are the S.I., where is your dress? Do I look naked to you? Can't you see the pant & shirt? Hey, I meant the uniform. It's in the laundry. I see. Okay, show me your identity card. I left it at home in hurry. I'm not an idiot to believe that you're an S.I. & What you say is true? Then, are you a stupid? If you talk too much, I'll also arrest you. If you talk anymore, I'll create false evidences & frame you as their leader. I'll drag you to court & put you in jail. How dare you? Totally 12, sir. Hey, he is asking hearts not the hooks. Come on... Come on.. Good morning, sir. - Good morning. Why're you looking so tensed? I didn't sleep all night. Is it because of mosquitoes? Revenge & vengeance. On whom? Is it on S.P.? On a woman? - A woman? Why are you so scared? I'm not scared. I'm totally shaken. Tell me, who is she? I'll not only give my life... ...lf necessary, I'll also give my salary. She is also a Police Officer. No, it's dangerous to fight Police. We're also Police, isn't it? That's why, I'm telling. We know how dangerous we are. Leading a king size life, how can I be afraid of a woman? She didn't even respect me. We must teach her a lesson. Since she doesn't care about the dept., I'll teach her a lesson. From today onwards, our job is to teach her a lesson. Hey, you... 5 for Rs.10. Look, give me 5 corn. Give me good & tender corns. Tender? I'm here not to sell corn. - Then, what? Black tickets. Black tickets? - Yes. Do you want? - Yes, give me 2 tickets. Take it. Let's go. Are you selling the tickets? I'm not selling at cheap rates, I'm selling at higher rates. For want of money, will you step down so cheaply? You idiot. I'm not selling tickets for money. There're many black ticket sellers over here. If I sell tickets, the regular sellers will create some trouble. We can arrest them red handed. Because of powerful, sincere Police Officers like you. ...Rowdies are afraid and are getting into politics. Enough of praising me. Go. If they see you, they'll recognise me. 10 for Rs.20. Girl, give me 5. - Give me hundred. You! Yes, my jasmine flower. Why're you selling the tickets in black? If not in black, I'll sell them in blue. Is it a side business? No, it's straight business. What bothers you? You're selling the tickets in black & talking against us. Not only black tickets, I'll also sell gold watch. What'll you do? You'll be arrested. Who are you to arrest me? I'm the S.I. of 2 town. 1 town above you. This is 1 town, means it's my town. It's only me who can make a arrest, if any. Yes, she is correct. Ours is a wrong step by mistake. I need not be a Policeman to arrest you. As an ordinary citizen, as a responsible youth... ..As an Indian... - As a Basha, as a Shiva. ...As a Pedarayudu, as a Chinnarayudu.. ...As a Sardar Paparayudu... These injustices... What's next? Violence... He has the right to end violence. I've the right to provoke him. I knew that you'll come with such idiotic ideas. That's why, I've bought my identity card. Where is your identity card? It must be here only. I think, I missed it somewhere. I'll find it now itself, whether it got missed or not. I'll reveal your true image to the public. Come. Brothers-in-law... sisters-in-law... come. Come. See this woman. Look at this woman, who's swindling the society & it's people. What's it, sir? What happened? Indian women are admired as mothers, sisters & wives. But, she is swindling the sweat & hard work of poor people in black. When I told her that woman shouldn't do like this. She calls herself as an Inspector of 1 town. I'm a Police Officer. If you're a Police Officer, you must catch black ticket sellers. ...And shouldn't sell black tickets. Are there any separate rules for you & people? This is a country where chaste Savithri, Sakubhai & Anusuya were born. It is a country which gave birth to Jayamalini, Jyothilakshmi, Pakeeza. Having born in such a country, if you sell black tickets. Will Poolandevi forgive you? Or will Sridevi tolerate this? Hey... Am I talking too much? Too much? Tell me, you citizens, tell me. What should we do with this woman? It's okay, leave her. If we leave her, they'll even sell the bus tickets in black. I'll take your snap & I'll paste it in your station itself. Come... Get down. Leave me. How can I leave you so easily? Come... Come. Come. Whom did you salute? To me or to her? Why would we salute you? We saluted our madam. How dare you salute a black marketing girl? Will you sing our National Anthem in front of the Union Jack? Hey, we'll talk to them later. Who's there? Where is the pen & pad? Where is the writer? I'm the writer. - Then, write.. Is it any serial? Are you joking? It's about a case. File an F.I.R. & put her in jail. Are you asking me to arrest our S.I.? - Who are you? If you talk without respect I'll break your backbone. Who do you think he is? I.G.'s favourite S.I. Keep these things later. First, file the case. Sir, she is.... - She might be anyone. Everyone is equal in the eyes of Justice. Write. Unless you tell me, how can I write? The subject is selling tickets in black. Imagine the rest & write. Since you're a writer, he has given you a chance. Show your talent in it. Take madam in. If you call her madam, I'll transfer you to forest. Call her a Criminal? Take the criminal in? Sir, she is a black marketeer. She is also the boss of black ticket sellers. Who do you think she is? She is the S.I. of this station. Being an S.I.... Moreover being a lady S.I... Could there be a worse insult than this? Our department is losing it's prestige because of such people. The film makers make fun of us because of such people. Sincere Officers like you lose their value because of such people. Because of such people, our department is getting spoilt. We shouldn't leave such people. Call all T.V. channels, press people and everyone. Do you know why she was selling tickets in the black? I know. Since they don't get bribes, they don't get any care. They don't get their salaries, and not able to digest their food. I sent her to arrest black ticket sellers. Really! Since our men don't know about your sincerity. They had put you in jail. It's okay. You can go. You have put me into jail in my station itself, isn't it? I'll see. What'll you see? Is it any phonographic song? You'll see what you're destined to see. I guess, this is what shake before use means? What's it? It seems, you've drank too much. - No, it's very less. Don't shake like that. It might leak from behind. I'm drinking the lucky drop, but there is no fragrance. Since you're drinking, how can you smell its fragrance? We can only smell it. It smells like kerosene. - It should've been adulterated. Son! - Yes. For how long will you keep burning your hands? Cook without burning your hand, your father is worried. Listen to me, get married. What's there in a hurry? - It's not for you, I'm in a hurry. What bothers you, if he doesn't marry? You shut up. You go to Police Station. I'm getting bored by sitting alone in the house. Even to prepare an omelette while drinking there's no woman in the house. Stop blabbering & cook. I'll bring vegetables from the market. What happened to the kerosene bottle which I had kept there? Was it a kerosene bottle? - Yes. I thought that it was a bottle of liquor & drank it. Did you drink it? Yes, how will the kerosene in my body come out? Very easy. Light a match stick & swallow it. Your stomach, kerosene & you'll also. How could you drink kerosene? - Hey... Madam, why're you going without giving money? Cash? He seems to be a new person. Tell him about me. Hey, who do you think she is? Who? Is she Amitabh Bachchan's Mother-in-law? 1 town S.I.'s own mother... Is she 1 town S.I.'s own mother? So, won't you give money? Hey, come to the Police Station. - Why? I caught you when you were trying to steal madam's bag... Come. You winked your eyes at me & spoke vulgarly. She saw that. I saw... I saw.. Oh! My God! I had asked you for money by mistake. Leave me, madam. It seems that this oldy is her mother. She is not an ordinary old lady. She's a ripened oldy. I'll buy 7 gm. of onions, 6gm of lady's finger, 5 gm of chilly. Don't you need 4 or 5 gms of leaf, spoiled cocumis, banana peel? What do you want, madam? Give 5 kgs.ladies finger, 5kg.... 5kg. chillies, 5kg.... 5kg. onion, 1 kg lemon. My goodness... my best customer ...My lucky customer. Customer should be like this. She ordered the quantity & never asked about the rates. Take her as an example. Make it fast. Yes. You are the first customer. Do you want anything more? This is enough for the day. Take the bill. No need. Keep it with you. Where is the money? Money? It's cash.... How dare you ask money from 1 town S.I.'s own mother? It's not that. It seems, you are selling bombs with brinjals. It seems you're supplying beer with cucumis without any licence. Oh! God! No.... You need not give money. Please go. Hail an auto. Since, you are 1 town S.I's own mother. Why should you travel by auto? Come... I'll drop you in my jeep. Who're you my dear? He's 2 town S.I. Your daughter & he have a good understanding. Did you see? Everyone must be dedicated the department like him. Let's go. What's this? Why've you brought me here? Since you're my aunty, I thought of putting you in jail. Are you going to put me in jail? Why're you looking at? Put her in jail. Do you know whom am I? 1 town Inspector's mother. It's a curse for being her mother, come. Leave me. Are you going to put me in jail? If I don't transfer to Andaman Islands immediately. I'm not her mother. If you talk unnecessarily, I'll kill you. Let's see how can you kill me. I'll phone Chief Minister & get you dismissed immediately. Is it Mr. Chandrababu Naidu? Greetings. Hold on the line. Madam wants to talk to you. You can talk. Why should we unnecessarily disturb him? Don't act too smart. If you phone him now, he'll make a blood donor. Behave like a constable. Don't act like an Inspector. Look, will you keep quiet. Or Shall I kill you in the lock up? Now, she'll come & fall at my feet to compromise. Look, the lady dragon has come. Be strict. She'll fall at our feet. Daughter - Mother. If you talk unnecessarily, I'll smash you. Keep quiet & play Stone game. I don't know that game. I'll call Srilankan team, will you play cricket with them? You want me to release your mother. You're very sharp. Don't apple polish me. Unknowingly... Not unknowingly... You & your mother are doing it wantonly. Your vegetable scam has come to light in our investigation. I'm really very innocent sir. I always tell her to buy things by paying money. But, because of her greediness my mother... We've got information from CBI that you're taking bribes through your mother. I'll never leave this case. We're going to move this case in Assembly or Parliament. Am I talking too much? Don't make a mess of it? Do I look so cheap? File an F.I.R. & take that old lady to court. No.... No... No.. If you tell me what you want.,.. What's this? Why're you here? Where'll I be without staying in the station with you? Then, Archana came & kissed me. Did she kiss you? - Yes. This is day dreaming, sir. May be she came in your dreams but she never came here. It seems, she has come. You keep your legs on the table. She'll come & hold your legs. You keep quiet & allow me to be dignified. Instead of her, her constables are coming. She might be feeling shy that's why, she's sending her messengers. Don't compromise with them. She'll not come. Tell that you won't talk with them. No, I won't listen to you. We came to... He knows very well that, why you've come & who sent you? Though you may cry by holding my legs. I'll not leave your madam's mother. Ask your madam to come & relieve her mother. Please listen to us. - What's it? Our Inspector has arrested your father. So what? He is in my station & in our custody. We were asked to give this information to you. Will you arrest me & remove my clothes? Do you know who is my son? Lodge a complaint. I'll make an enquiry on whose is your son. Being a woman, Are you telling vulgar jokes? If my son comes to know about this... If you talk vulgarly I'll blast you with bombs. Be careful, madam. - Come, madam. Walk slowly... Go... come in. Son, you've come at the right time. Teach her a lesson. Though I told her that I'm your father, she never listened to me. She handcuffed me, removed my dress & put me in jail. Be happy that I didn't remove your underwear. It's not because you felt pity on me. You didn't remove it because of your safety. Keep quiet. Why're you talking to the Inspector like that? Please come, madam. - Come, madam. I've brought your mother. If you can release my father.. An FIR has been filed that 2 town Inspector is ... ....Selling scotch whisky through his father. Keep quiet... It's necessary to have witness while writing the FIR, isn't it? His father has given a statement that his son is asking him to sell whisky. You betrayer. How could you be his father? What do I know? They said that they'll release me if I sign the papers. Did they say that they'll release or they'll provide liquor? I can't remember since I was fully drunk. Take him to the court with that complaint. Victoria, wait... wait.... Why should we both quarrel? If you arrest my father or If I arrest your mother.. ...lt's our department's prestige that'll lose its honour. Actually, such people shouldn't be left out. Atleast, release him this time. Don't think that you're the only brilliant person. Only now, we understood that you're also brilliant. Never ever quarrel with me. Even if you wish him to quarrel with you, he'll not. Release that old man. She doesn't know about me. Do you've any sense? It's alright, you drink. Why did you sell scotch whisky? Why would I sell scotch whisky, if I've it, I'll drink. He's correct. Since you didn't sell, why did she arrest you? She came & knocked the door. I opened the door & inquired who she is. She told that she was our neighbour. She told that she had taken kerosene from you. She gave me 2 bottles. I thought it's true & I was going in. That's all. She came in with the police & arrested me. Oh! God! She's finished. Her marriage is over. Come on, take this. Oh! God! You are 1 town Inspector's mother. Why're you giving money? We don't want it free of charge. Are you fine? Is it inter caste marriage? No. Why is the priest sitting next to your daughter? Yuck! He the priest who is performing the marriage. Sit down. - I see. Where is the groom? He is dressing inside. Sir, please bring the groom. What's this? I asked you to bring the groom, but you've brought the groom's father. I'm the groom. I decided to marry only after earning rupees 10 crores. I went abroad. It took some time to earn. So, I'm getting married a bit late. What kind of a groom is he? Stop it. Myself or my father should've told this. Who's she? She might be your sister. She might've stopped the marriage because of sister-in-law's dowry. I've none. Hey, get up. When? You only... idiot. How many more times will you marry? To how many women will you be a husband? What's it? Is he already married? Not a marriage? Marriages... 6 marriages. Don't worry, father-in-law. I've divorced them. If you had divorced them. You must've performed her marriage like a father. Instead, you're sitting next to her as a groom. Who are you to question these things? I'm the voice of the women with whom you play. Look, if her marriage gets stopped now. She'll never get married. Why not? What's wrong with your daughter? Marriage won't take place if a man doesn't like the woman. But if a woman doesn't like a man will you perform her marriage? She's sitting here with her consent only. Will any girl like this 50 year old crooked husband? Will any girl marry him whole heartedly? Girl, Are you not beautiful or are you not wealthy? Or don't you've the courage to live on your own? Don't you've the guts to marry a person you like? Are you going to marry & give yourself to this hangman? Will you live like a dead person? This brute will swindle your money & enjoy you for some days. ...And like others, he'll divorce you & marry another girl. This time, I'll not do it. This is my last & final marriage. I'll accept to wear the auspicious thread not the gallows. Women are not broomsticks to be in the corner after your needs are fulfilled. If needed, she'll also turn into a sword. You've enlightened me. If not married, I'll stay as a spinster all my life. I'll never marry such idiot. Get lost. How could we leave him so easily? I'll bring him to light & hand over him to the police. Come... come. Poor fellow, bride's daughter had spent a lot money for the marriage. Let the money go to hell. But, the girl's life is saved. Okay, how many children does your son has? It would've been 3 children, if he was married. It means, is he not yet married? No. Has your daughter got married? Looking for alliances. Then, let's see our alliance. Don't mistake me. I mean to say that how'll it be if your daughter & my son get married. It'll be very nice. But they're like cat & dog. Will they agree to marry? We'll use our brains & get them married. What's it? For how long will you whip the stick like a man? If you get married & hold a baby on your shoulders. You'll look great as a mother. That's why, I've got an alliance. The boy is very good. He is in a wonderful job. I like him very much. It's not you, it's me who should like him. If you see him, you'll call him as your Prince & fall at his feet. Whether I'll fall or get up. Bring his photo, only then I'll tell you. Look, baby. You might get deceived by looking at the photo. If anyone applies make up & takes a snap. ...Even an 80 year old will look young & beautiful. So, I'll call them. Meet him directly. If you like him, we'll fix the alliance. I won't marry. She'll look very beautiful. I'll not marry even if she is very beautiful. What's the problem? I'm in love with a girl. You can also fall in love with her, after you marry her. She'll be a very good match for you. You both are in the same department. So, you can go & come in the same jeep. Same department? Who's it? The 1 Town Inspector who arrested me. Yes. Oh My father... Why're you telling this so late? I'm in love with that girl only. If it's Archana, I'll marry immediately. Why should we delay, fix the marriage date. Please wait. The boy must come, I must see him & I must like him. You'll definitely like him. We'll fix it after I like him. No need to worry. Did you call 2 Town Inspector? No. What's all this? Why did you come here? We're on duty. C.I. is coming. Why C.I. is coming here? After he arrives, we'll ask him & tell you. Him? When did he become C.I.? Today morning only. What's this? It's our culture to greet with folded hands. Why're you saluting him? He is not a guest to greet with folded hands. Till yesterday a colleague. Today by cadre big boss. I came here to become your husband. Why're you dressed like a new bride? Sir, it is... Bride seeing function. Oh! Is it Bride seeing function? Is he the groom? Yuck! Not him. Then, who? I don't know. Hey you, my innocent daughter. He is the person who came to see you. Him? Why didn't you tell me before that it was him? If we had told you before, you would've said No. That's why, your mother & myself enacted in this way. Do you think I'll say `Yes'? I'll never marry your son. Did you think that I'll marry you if you come like a C.I.? I'll talk to her. He wants to marry you. What's all this? I'll not marry him. Why? What's wrong with him? He's handsome, wealthy & got a good job. Above all that, he is also arrogant. It's the arrogance which looks good in him. Moreover the more arrogant a man is, the more the powerful he'll be. You don't know. He want's to marry me to take revenge. To achieve me & to play with me. No. To adore you. I like you. I wanted to see you, talk to you & spend time with you. I wanted to do these things that's why, I quarreled with you. Not to hurt you. I really love you. It's a lie. No, it is true. I loved you at the first time I saw you. I wanted to share life & live with you. If you say `No', I can't bear that. If I say `Yes'. Stop. You look like a dancer in V channel. Who're you? Your name sounds good. If anyone utters my name even children don't drink milk. Will they drink horlicks? Keep quiet. Even if you apply sweetener on me.. No bee or ant will come near me. Why? Do you stink so badly? Don't joke. Give me your corn without saying a word. - Yuck! Why did you talk so much for asking this? That's the killer Kirlosker style. What's in your pocket? - Milk bottle & wallet. Did you consider me as a child to take the milk bottle? Take the wallet. - Take it... Take it. Take that watch also. My mother-in-law presented me this on the eve of New Year. Since you like it, take it. Can I go? Wait... wait... wait. Don't shout. He might get up. Is he a Prince? - No, he is my son. Give me the two bangles this baby is wearing. He is fast asleep & they are very tight. If we take it, he'll get up. If he gets up, he'll start crying. Let him cry. If he cries, will the earth get drowned? Take it. If you really want it, give me your address. I'll come & give it to you. Did I ask you for my past loan? Get lost. What's your feeding you? Your hands are very fat. Don't cry... Don't cry. How dare you make my child? You're finished. Don't cry, dear. Don't cry... I'm here, isn't it. Dear, Is your shopping over? - Yes, it's over. There are 2 soaps over there. Take it. Without considering that I'm a comic villain, you broke my teeth, isn't it? See, what I'm going to do to him? - No. Don't harm my son. Your son? He told that he was his son. You useless. If she's my wife, won't he be her son also? Then, I won't harm your son. I'll rape your wife. She doesn't even allow me to come near her. How'll she allow you to rape her? - Is she so powerful? Very powerful. Listen to me. Don't get on with her. She is only a girl. What'll she do? I'm telling you because I feel pity on you & you are also a man like me. Don't get on with her. Don't talk like a mentally retarded person. Though I'm weak compared to men. I'm very strong with women. Oh God! He's finished. Another teeth. - I'll make a call. Hey, I told you not to trouble her & that you'll be beaten up. Did you listen to me? Look, you've lost another teeth. Poor fellow, leave him. - I'll never leave him. Take him & put him in jail. No, please don't arrest me till Saturday. If you want, I'll surrender myself on Sunday. Why? Do you've any auspicious hour? Yes, I'm going to get married to my uncle's daughter on Saturday. I'll perform your marriage in the station. No, please listen to me. Do you want the doll? What's that smile? Oh God! Is the doll looking nice? Look, how he is smiling? You can take him out & pamper him, if he is smiling, isn't it? What's this? We must pamper him only when he's crying not while laughing. Yes, that's the latest development. Understood. Dear, let's go. Let's go out & play. What're you looking at? Seeing your beauty getting more beautiful every day. Oh! Please leave me. This is the most routine dialogue delivered by every wife. Don't you want to go to station? Your life is itself a Police Station. In that you're a prisoner. Your husband is an Inspector there. You're not able to differentiate between Day & Night. Mad girl! I've forgot about time itself. How can I remember day & night? No, please. - Don't say, no please. Getting late. - No problem. I'm your boss at home & office, isn't it? Sir, SP has come. Tomorrow we've to produce evidence against Minister's brother in Court, isn't it? Is everything ready? - Archana is looking after that case. Where's Archana? Sir, I think, she hasn't come yet to Office. May be not yet come? May be she'll come now. Time is going to be 11 a.m. Has she taken permission for late coming? No sir! How can she come late without permission? I'll take action against her, sir. What's the news today? Do you think am I a Doordharshan reporter to tell news? What happened to you? You're a subordinate. Without wishing me, are you sitting in front of me? Okay! Enough! Switch on that fan. It's very sultry. What's the time now? You've a watch on your hand, isn't it? I didn't ask you the time to know what's the time? But to let you know why you've come so late? Don't you know, why? Why're you replying to me like you do to your husband? I'm asking you as a responsible higher officer. Why're you so late? Do you want me to tell? - You must tell. All 24 hours my husband is with Carnal desires. Getting up at 5 a.m. finishing all household chores, cooking & body work. When I was changing dress to come to office. He came correctly from the back side. - Please shut up. If you want to satiate your husband's desires, take a day off. Not on duty hours like this. This is... Go & carry on with your work. I didn't expect you here, sir. Father! How's your daughter-in-law's mood? Very bad! Dear! Yes! I'm thirsty please get me a glass of water. Take it yourself & drink. Get me a tea please. Prepare it yourself! No need! I'll have dinner! What did you cook? What will I cook? I finished dinner. Gave the leftovers to maid servant. You're the greatest devoted wife! Guessing that I'll not be hungry today. You've found it earlier! Wife? Joke? You're a good woman, so you stopped with that word. If it had been another wife... - Do you've another wife? Instead of telling another's wife I said another wife. Are you angry? - No, burning! Then, I'll cool it off! - Don't touch me! Do you've to create such a scene before SP? You could've told something and managed, isn't it? As if you're very sincere and I'm irresponsible. That means law and justice... Why're you sleeping on floor? I must respect Law & justice, isn't it? You're C.I, I'm just an S.I. You must be on top I must be down. That's for the outside world only. Duty isn't important than wife & children, isn't it? This is for inside the house. Don't talk like an opportunist man to get things done. Am I so low to get scolded by you? Why're you crying? What happened now? Why will I cry? If I resign that useless job... Then, people who should cry will cry. Don't do like that my better half. You won't bear any short of this! A husband will get mood only when a wife is angry. I'm not getting any mood leave me. But, I've got, isn't it? Automatically, you'll also get it come. Today is the final hearing of Minister's brother case. All evidence are perfect, isn't it? If not Minister will use all his power to free his brother! No sir, every thing is perfect! Definitely, he'll get a life term. Take him. Why did you bring him here? Father is not at home! I must go our urgently. And he's crying! Unable to decide what to do. I must go to court! Okay, give him to me. No dear... SP is inside. What?- What happened? Some one had blown up the van with a land mine. People travelling in it. All have been charred to death. No one survived! It's been 2 years since their death. How many more days you'll spend mourning for them? I can't bear to see you like this. You must become normal. You must marry again. Father - Yes, son. I can't betray my Archana by marrying again. Will you betray us by becoming mad & sleepless? We are not asking you to forget Archana. We are asking you to forget the sorrow of losing her. Any how my daughter is dead. At least you be happy! I'm not telling as a mother-in-law but as a mother. I'll live only as Archana's husband not as some one else's husband. You didn't just had a dead wife you've a living father also. I'm also a husband for a wife. I know what's life without a wife. Unable to forget your mother I contemplated suicide also. But you're a motherless child. Thinking you shouldn't become fatherless also. That's why, I'm still alive. I became a drunkard unable to forget her. You shouldn't become like me. Our family line shouldn't perish with you. You need a partner and this home needs a lady. If you've the affection on this living father which you've on a dead wife. Then, marry again. Tell me, if you're not interested I'll die under some running train. Don't refuse son. Sir, if not for you atleast marry again for us. If you marry again even madam will feel happy in heaven. Okay! As you wish! I'm very happy now! On this happy occassion - Will you drink a full bottle? No! From today, I'm quitting drinking habit. From today you're not working with son-in-law but with us. We'll search a bride. Then get a photo of sir in a good pose. We'll show it to the bride. Groom is handsome. If you see him personally he'll be more handsome. He'll be stunning! It isn't enough if he's just handsome. He must be good enough to marry also. He must be according to my principles & philosophy. That means...? That means my husband should be like Lord Rama. You mean he must be striking arrows with crowns & forehead mark. Not in that get up! He must be like Lord Rama in personality. He's not like him he's Lord Rama himself. Even Lord Rama might've seen Shoorpanaka. My son would see only the boot not even the face of a lady constable. He mustn't ask a pie as dowry! My C.I has plenty of property. But my son is already.... --is he married? Oh! No, dear! This is his first marriage. He had refused many proposals. Why? Any problem? - No he didn't like any girl. It seems he got very impressed with your photo. If you say okay... It's okay for me! Why didn't you tell her that it's second marriage for him? If I tell her she's refuse - For that? For that will you tell her lie and get her married. No one is willing to marry for her modern views & principles. We've got your proposal after a long time. If we hide about the fact and get them married. Once they're married and 3 nights are over. That means cheat her into this marriage. What's there to cheat her in this? Does she've to bring up the first wife's children? Does she've to share the husband with her? Not that sir, she's very modern. We met her once in a marriage. Later on if she creates any trouble. If she does like that it'll be my daughter who'll be at loss. When he's telling so confidently why should we bother about it? If you refuse she'll not get a husband in this life. Don't refuse. Okay! As you wish. Don't worry about my wish! Did you tell everything to the girl? Everything means... Except about your earlier marriage.... Not only that I've told everything about our family also - Yes... Yes. What did she say? - She regretted! She felt pity on you. She wished to marry you. If you also agree... Okay!... As you wish. Anyhow we hid the fact from the bride why with your son also. Then, he'll refuse marriage. He may get to know at least later on, isn't it? Bride's father told, that once married & 3 nights are over. Everything will fall into place. My son will also do the same. We'll get them married cooly and pack them off to honey moon. Sit here, sir. How much? Then, do one thing. Keep this Rs.1,000 and think it as Rs 10,000. Rs 1000? It won't work out. Then, do one thing. Will it workout if I write this building to you? It won't work out, sir. - I'll beat you. Sir what's this? Look at him. Ram koti, why're you bargaining with him? Settle him quickly. Father-in-law... Mother... You...? I didn't die. I'm alive. Your son's love has saved my life. This boy?-Your grandson. Oh! my dear come... come to me, dear. Where were you all these days? What happened to you? I'll tell you all that details later. Where's my husband? Is he inside? No madam. - Has he gone to office? He has gone to Ooty. - On duty? Yes madam, on duty only. In which hotel he's staying there? You come inside, we'll discuss. - No, mother. I must meet him first. I must go to Ooty immediately. Why?... He'll be back in 2-3 days. I lived like a zombie without seeing him. Father-in-law, I can't stay even for a moment without meeting him. No... Archana, listen to me. What to do now? - I'm also confused. Whether to feel sad for getting son-in-law married again, ...or to feel happy to see my daughter come alive again. I'm confused. I'm totally confused. I can't bear this tension. I'll have. I'll start drinking again. Phone and inform him about madam's arrival & not to reveal about marriage. I'm Ernakulam Arumugam speaking. I had ordered for tea. It hasn't come yet. What happened to it? Wrong number. Till now, you were going great guns. Suddenly you're mellowed with shyness. A woman bows her head in marriage. And bows her head with shyness on her nuptial night. Is it? Who's that sir? A person named Vikrant from Hyderabad has come there. Put me to his room please. He has instructed not to disturb him till morning. He wouldn't have expected a call from me. Please put me to his room immediately. It's an urgent matter. Otherwise families will break up because of you. Let it break up. But our hotel shouldn't get bad reputation. Finished. How can I to stop this World war Ill? If I go on flight. Don't finish off all your shyness on this night itself. Still there are 2 more nights. It's too bright. Close that curtain also. What are you looking out there? Nothing. - I'll be back in a minute. You...? - Yes it's me... your Archana. Our son. My dear son. Kissing in public is banned here. Other people may feel uncomfortable, isn't it? Please control yourself. We'll go to room. - Go. Not that side - Why? Some one else is there. - Who? I'll tell you later. I'll book another room, wait. I was very eager to see you. I even feared of missing to see you. Where were you all these days? What happened to you? That day, when I was taking Minister's brother to the court. His henchman attacked us. They kidnapped me and Babu and blew up the van. Why? In anticipation of the charges being dropped for inadequate evidence. If any problem crops up, they wanted to escape by using me as a ploy. That means... these 2 years... I & Babu were held captive by him. When court had dropped these charges recently, ...they freed us. Where are they now? They've left this country. How are you? Don't you know how will I be in your absence? Thinking that you're dead... Dear it's me, Jhansi. Where are you? Here near by only. Without staying with me on our honeymoon. You're saying that you're somewhere else. Come quickly. Alright, I'll come. Who's that? I'll come back and tell you in detail. Wait. I'll come back immediately. Which is Vikrant's room? - He has taken up 2 rooms. In which is he staying? We don't know Telugu. Inspite of being a Telugu man, can't you tell even that. Moreover, wearing a suit also. What are you doing here? - Sir, Archana madam is alive. She came here just now. Did you meet her? - No. Did you tell her about your marriage? No. I've to tell her now. - Don't tell sir. Why? When she has come eagerly after 2 years of separation, ...how can you tell her that you're married again? She'll not be able to bear this shocking news. She'll jump to death from terrace like Divya Bharathi. True. She's very sensitive. Then, I'll tell Jhansi. That's much more dangerous. Why? She knows everything about me, isn't it? She doesn't know anything. We had hid to her that this is your first marriage & made her to accept. I had asked you to tell everything to her before marriage. And you said that you had told her. If we had told, both of you wouldn't have agreed to this marriage. So, we lied. She's very volatile. If she comes to know this truth. She'll publish your photo in Newspaper about as much married C.I. ...and in that angry mood she may even commit suicide. How is the lady in room NO.206 related to you? She?... She's my wife. - She's calling you. Okay. How's the lady in Room NO.306 related to you? She.... she too is my wife. She's calling you. She's calling. She's also calling. Where am I to go? Don't go to anyone. Take another room & rest there. Though you may not get mental peace, you'll be saved from getting mad. What am I to do now? I'm numb. My heart is pounding. You're lucky. My entire body is pounding. Sir, how many times I've to tell you. Your son's mother is calling you. Okay, I'm coming now - Go.... It seems moon is going away and sun is coming. Your honeymoon wife is calling you. I surrender myself to you Lord Ayyappa. Where did you go away, dear? It's going to break into dawn. It's going to break into dawn for you. And my desire has slumped down. What's this slumped down? That's my S.P. He has come here suddenly. Why're you bothered about it? You're on a holiday, isn't it? Mine is a useless essential service, isn't it? Even on a holiday, it's like I'm on duty only. Look, it must be from him only. Sir, I'm Ramakoti. Greetings sir. Tell me sir. Sir, why're you greeting me? I'm your Head constable. Terrorist? Is he here? Do I've to nab him? What's this terrorist & nabbing sir? ...I'm Ramakoti. Sir, Archana madam is looking for you in all corridors. I know it sir. How can I go now & catch them? I don't even have my AK-47 with me now. Ak-47..?! I think he has gone mad with the shock given by 2 wives. True, it's our first night. We're in a good mood. Is it good on your part to ask me like this? No doubt. He's surely gone mad. Okay. I'm coming there immediately. Where are you going out again? It seems, I've to catch some terrorist... - He's calling you. You've got it right. I'll tell him that I'm not coming with him. You be here and don't get upset. What's this dear? What?- I've come to you eagerly after a 2 year separation. You went away without even spending 2 minutes with me. That's... my S.P has come here. Who? Mr.Shahrukh Khan? No, Mr.Aamir khan..... It seems to be some important case. No cases for a month. Then, wait here. I'll apply for leave & come. This is a 5-star hotel. We can't accept you having 2 women in 2 rooms. Then, will you give some other room? We can't give you 2 rooms. Do you want me to have both of them in one room? Impossible. This is a respectable hotel where families stay. That's why, I've come with families (wives). Look, there are hotels which cater to 2-in-1 types like you. Check in there. Is it?- Yes. - Okay. Silly job. It's better to resign this job and sell mango jelly on tank bund. What happened? - Asking me, what happened? Though I said, it's my first night, he insists on nabbing terrorist right now. Then, no first night, isn't it? Why not? There are plenty of nights. Come here. Pick up madam's luggage. Alright. You go to Hyderabad with him. I'll look after this terrorist matter and come back in 2-3 days. I went crazy and married a policeman. I'm hungry. Okay. I'll go down & bring something. Enough... Please leave me. You were cool in the room but got enraged in the lift. what's it? You're going away, isn't it? I couldn't control myself. Then, shall I stay back? Oh God! No. Go away. We're vacating our room. - Which room? Which room? Our room only. What about 206? Who's staying in 206? My S.P is staying there. I'm vacating that room also. - Come madam, car is ready. You go.- Come madam. - Come quickly. Thank God, one job is over. What's this? You too are packing your bags. What's this, me too? Is anyone else also packing? That's my boss Mr.Aamir Khan. Just now, he too had packed his bags. We'll go home. - What... now? She too went just now. Who's she? - That's my boss. You said... She went. Oh! it's not she... it's he. He went just now. I don't know what I'm blabbering in tension. Why're you tensed up? You've come, isn't it? - Don't you like my coming back? No. I like your coming back. It's my officer's coming here which I don't like. Okay, get going. Let's stay here for 2 days and then go. In the eagerness of meeting you. I didn't talk properly with mother & father-in-law also. If you want, we can come back here after 2 days. For God sake, don't bring your many wives to our hotel. Okay, we'll do like that only. Do you've to stress on it so much? What is he saying? He's saying that his hotel's business is going dull. He's requesting me to stay here only, whenever I visit this place. You go. I'll go. No need. Just go away, it's enough. Why're you so serious? Incapable to look comic. What happened? We're fine. you both... What will happen to us? That's, I think he was worried about out travel. Isn't it, father. Yes, dear. Brother-in-law.... Brother-in-law. Oh! son-in-law. Have you come back so quickly? I had to come for an urgent work. Then, where's my daughter? Your daughter? She has gone to the convent. Convent? why? Why? To study. Who's he? I'm his father-in-law. Distant... A distant relative. Distant? I'm your close relative. My mother's brother, his uncle's, brother-in-law. His brother-in-law's co-brother. How can you be a close relative? Just say, yes. Such a distant relative. If as you said, then how can he be his maternal uncle. He must be his paternal uncle. I'm his Maternal uncle. Somewhere something has gone wrong and our relationship changed. I've never seen him here before. In your absence, in a forceful situation. He bonded this relationship. You might've got tired by the journey. Go & take bath. Go. Son-in-law, what's all this? Where's my daughter? She's in my pocket. - Come on, take it, shut up. Crying aloud for your daughter. We've safely put her up in a hotel here. My daughter is in hotel. Who's this girl? Your son-in-law's first wife. Without listening to my disapproval of this marriage. You went a head & got me married. At least, if you had told this truth to Jhansi, ...we wouldn't have faced this situation now, isn't it? Why to scratch old wounds? Think about the future. After 2 years of difficulties my daughter has come eagerly. Don't hurt her and render injustice to her. You mean to hurt my daughter and do injustice to her. I didn't mean that, brother-in-law. Your talk sounds like that only, sister-in-law. You want justice for your daughter. What do you want for my daughter? You're missing to catch a point in this. If justice is done to her daughter it'll be injustice to your daughter. If justice is done to your daughter then it'll be injustice to her daughter. If we do justice to both of them. It'll be injustice to your son. Oh my God! What will happen to my daughter? Why're you crying now? If not me, will my neighbour cry for my daughter's sorrows? Expecting such a situation, God had made me not to consummate this marriage. My daughter didn't have this happiness also. Be happy. If your daughter had enjoyed that happiness. You would've been in sorrows now. Since, she's still a virgin even after marriage. You can atleast try to get her married again. Are you playing fun? Who'll marry her after her first marriage? After coming from a honeymoon. Who'll believe if we claim her to be a virgin. What do you want me to do? It's wrong for a woman to have 2 husbands. It isn't wrong for a man to have 2 wives. So... Do you want to live with both of them? Impossible. I loved & lived happily with Archana only. She's only my wife. Isn't my daughter your wife? If that Archana hadn't come back. Wouldn't you've accepted my daughter as your wife? It's different if she hadn't come back. What do you want me to do after her come back. I'll live with only one woman, and that's with Archana only. You say you'll not live with my daughter. Don't interfere bloody. I'll kick you. Brother-in-law. Brother-in-law, what's this? Will you spoil my daughter's life. Will you ruin my daughter's life? Hey! don't cry like this and make us to laugh? I'll set it right. Son, it's dangerous if anyone of them comes to know this truth. So, for sometime manage them in different houses. After that, you reveal it slowly to them. They'll decide what should be done. This seems good idea, follow it son. Okay. Will he live with my daughter, brother-in-law? He'll definitely. First, if we subdue his anger and make them come closer. Saying she's also my wife he'll come to terms with her. That means from today my C.I is 2-in-1. No... 1 by 2. This is our cupid's kingdom. How's it? It's good but why do we need a separate flat for us. Son, go & look around the flat. We're going to romance after a 2 year lull, isn't it? If we raise shrieks & shrills, old people may get tensed up. No one will disturb us here. All mischievous ideas. Moreover, I don't want to continue with my job. Why? You serve the state. I'll serve you & settle all the old dues. Thank God! I have brought one vehicle into the right track. Now, I've to look after her matter. Don't know which mother's son's we are. We were brought up in the same cell for 2 years. Brother, this jail bond should continue all our life. As your say, brother. What's your immediate programme? As a rowdy, I had done innumerable crimes. Never in my life I had been to a police station. I'll kill that lady S.I & her husband for putting me into a jail. After that, I'll kidnap my fiancee and marry her by force. What's your programme? Before the red dye had dried and spoiling my 7th marriage, ...One who had made me useless to the new as well as old wives, I've to find out who that Lady Leader is and kill her. Ramkoti, get it done quickly. - Put it inside. It's getting late. Jhansi, what's this? Shifting. - Shifting? Why? Why couldn't we consummate our marriage? It was SP's problem in our honeymoon. Here it's a problem with auspicious time. 'Vasthu' is the problem for all our problems. It seems this building doesn't have good 'Vasthu'. It seems we'll never consummate our marriage if we stay here. Astrologer told this. So, I've found a good flat with excellent Vasthu. - Flat? Where? That is our 1 Town flat. - Oh my God! There? What's this 1 Town flat? It is near by 1 Town. You can't find worse apartments in entire Hyderabad. Moreover, that area isn't good. Shut up. The neighbourhood is excellent. Those are the best flats in this city. No Jhansi, it's troublesome area. Too many rowdies also. Why're you afraid of rowdies though you're a policeman? He's not afraid of rowdies but wives... Wives? - Police are like husband to rowdies, isn't it? Then, rowdies are wives of Police, isn't it? That's it. Brilliantly covered it. Covered? Instead of saying clarified, he said, covered. We'll shift into some other flat. ....I like that flat very much. No more arguments regarding this matter. Come. Hey! What's all this problem man? Fights between wives in flats climax in Apartments. Couldn't you cook up something & stop her? Where did these oldies go? What's the meaning of those attires & songs? Watching you here is giving us heart attacks. So, we're leaving for a pilgrimage to Kasi. Dear, shall we go? - To Kasi? No, to flat. How am I to take her to Archana & manage her? Unable to find a solution for that only. We had taken this decision to go on a pilgrimage. Show both of them all the movies with 2 wives. If you're able to bring about a compromise, write a letter. We'll finish our pilgrimage & come back. If not... Are you asking him also to come there in this attire? That's all, isn't it? Will you go away leaving C.I. like Kashmir between India & Pakistan? You can't avoid it anymore. Row my boat in the mid sea, Oh God! Sing...& go to them. Unload the luggage & bring it to the flat. Come. Are you put up here only? Are you doing well? Did anyone tell you, I'm not doing well? With your grace, he's still a bachelor. Who's he? Our relative? Yuck! He's a cheat. When his wife is still alive, lying that he's a bachelor. ...A crook who had married many times. They say, we can tell 100 lies to conduct a marriage. May be he tried to marry 100 times by telling one lie. That's why, I put him into a jail for 2 years. It had come in all Newspaper and was shown on all T.V. channels also. Not all T.V. channels, only on E-TV. Did you see that? It seems it was shown on E-TV. Are you planning any villainous tricks? How can he play a villain. He's doing comic roles only. Enough of revealing my story. Keep quite. - Come, dear. What? You're going on marrying, isn't it. How do you keep this a secret & manage them? Can you give details? Why do we need it? His character is some what nearer to you, isn't it? May be episodes from his serial will be helpful to us. Great act... Come. You go ahead. I'll come with the luggage. Please, manage carefully. Dear, Why don't you come? - Coming... Which floor? Yes. Why? Nothing, it'll be higher. - No problem... come. Why did you jump in like that? New flat, isn't it? I thought it'll be good and variety. Come. How's it? Yuck! It's disgusting, we'll look out for another flat. You don't have good taste at all. When you find such a beautiful view here. Not good? I like it very much. Moreover, 'Vasthu' is also perfect. - Not that... Don't say another word. Get the luggage. Okay. I'm dead. Has your father come? You go on, I'll come. Why've you stopped there itself? What's all this packages? We've all these things, isn't it? Why did you buy them again? Dear, why don't you bring the luggage inside? Who's she? - Who's she? Why don't you say? Who's she? Actually, who are you? I'm his wife. Are you wife of my husband? Your husband? If you've eye sight problem wear specs. He's my husband. If you call my husband as your husband I'll break your teeth. Will you break my teeth for calling my husband as my husband. You'll get killed... He's my husband. No, he's my husband. - No, he's my husband. Please give me way. I feel this scene may be of help to me. Show me. - If you want, see this. He has tied auspicious thread also. You would've tied it by yourself. He had married me only. If you want, see our son. Dear, Is that lady telling the truth? If you call me as that lady, I'll cut you with a knife. When she's saying so much, why're you silent? He'll say anything only if he's your husband, isn't it? She's only my wife. Is she your wife? Then, who am I? Who are you? - Don't you know, who am I? Why'll I ask, if I know you? Don't you know me really? Why is she going in so fast? I hope she hasn't gone to commit suicide. If you don't know me, how come you lived with me? And fathered a son. How did you get into these photographs? Dear, what's all this? Marrying her and becoming father to a son... Did you marry me as a second wife? Have you gone crazy? Me marrying second time? If not, what are those photos? - I'm not the one in that photos. Are you not the man in this photo? - 100% we're different people. That man & me are different. If you want watch your husband doesn't have specs but I've. Your husband has ear ring, but I don't have. You might've put on specs and taken off this ear ring. I'll smash you with slippers, if you talk in between. I wear specs by birth. I don't have a ear ring. When did you start to tell lies & cheat? Why should I cheat you? May be your husband looks like me. That means double role? - May be. Then, are you not my husband? If I accept as your husband, your real husband will be left in lurch. Not her husband, Ill be left in the lurch. Come. Who's this lady who has given a shock on our arrival? That's why, I said no to this flat. Now that everyone knows who you are.. There'll be no more problems in the future. My head is tensed up. I'll have a bath & come. Any trouble? - Give me that brief case. Take it. Madam, is he your husband? - Yes. But, he's not accepting & says its dual role. That's what I can't understand. Hey Archana, is there any meeting by the flat people? Not meeting sir, there was a little commotion and an accident. What happened? A couple have moved into our opposite flat. Her husband is exactly like you only. Why're you surprised? He's not your husband. He's my husband. - Greetings. If he wears specs, he'll be exactly like my husband. Yes... as your husband had said... dual role. Without knowing the truth, I had abused you. No problem, even I would've behaved the same if I was in your place. Please call, your husband! I'll introduce my husband to him. Alright. You don't go in. I'll go & give him a surprize. You look like a replica of me. They'll easily believe if we say we're twins. When, I see you now, I feel like I'm seeing myself in the mirror. Like in these movies, we look like twin brothers. That's alright, what are you doing? - I'm C.I. in Domalguda Police Station. Okay, what're you doing? - Oh! I'm surprised. I'm also a Policeman. I'm also a C.I. Not only they look alike, they work in the same department also. When I see them together... It's like watching movie `Hello Brother'. I'm very happy to meet you. We'll meet often like this. Certainly. He's exactly like me. Isn't it thrilling? Definitely, it's thrilling to shock me. I once again say sorry for abusing you. Forget it, hereafter we're friends. Come... come... we'll go. Why're you still standing here? Dual role movie is over, clear out. You're not twins. How come you both are look alikes? I'm also surprised. May be your father & his mother... Yuck! My father is a gentleman. May be your mother and his father... Don't try to dig into the issue too much. Get me some thing to eat. I'm hungry. I'll get it in 2 minutes, sit down. Don't rush! Do it leisurely, I'll have bath & come mean while. Study! Dear! Where's he? Coming. Just now you had bath and were talking to him. Why did you go to bathroom again? I forgot to close the tap. I went to close the tap. It's time to leave to office. You arrange all things. I'll go. Come here quickly evening. - Alright. Is breakfast ready? It's ready hot. Dear, our son wants to go to Zoo. - Do you want to go to Zoo? Be ready by 2 p.m., I'll go to station and come back by afternoon. Are you going to station again? You came home just now only. From today, I've to work 2 shifts. Work load has increased. It's me. Who's Archana? I didn't call you as Archana. A Priest is conducting a prayer here, I said do Archana (prayer) correctly. Why did you call me at this hour? I'm bored to death at home. I thought of spending time with opposite flat Archana. It seems she is going to Zoo with her husband. Yes. How do you know that? Her husband told me. Shall we also? Not today. Some other day. Today, I've some other appointment. Leave it. For you, she's more important than me. She?... Who's she? That.... useless job. You spend day & night for it, but for me not even a couple of hours. That means.... Nothing doing. Will you come or not? When you're asking so affectionately, how can I refuse? I'll come. Then, do one thing, I'll be waiting for you at Zoo by 3 p.m. You come straight away there. Okay. Sir, any new problem? - Yes, I'm dying with these two women. This shows, even 2 Town C.I. also shouldn't have 2 wives. No need of Morals, advise me. Jhansi asks me to take her to Zoo. Archana too makes same request. Who'll you take if it were you? Don't make fun sir, How can I take your wife to Zoo? I didn't tell you to take her. I was asking if you had faced this problem what would you do? If it was me, I would've gone alone & offer myself to a lion & get killed. That means, are you suggesting me to kill myself? Not for now sir. Do one thing. One Town is little soft, so leaving her at home. Since, Two Town is hot headed. Take her to Zoo. Then, you call my first wife and saying, I'm busy. And will take them tomorrow... saying this manage her. I'll manage the second wife. Where are you leaving? That's to Zoo only. Then, we'll go in auto, come. - Why did you come here? One Town phone is not responding. Madam, Greetings - Greeting. You here? What's this one Town? - That's official work. I told you to wait at home only. Why did you come here? Nothing! Zoo is near to this place. From here if you come home & from there if we go to zoo. It'll take time, so we came here. You've done it correctly, madam. If our Railways had your time sense. We would've loaned money to America. Come. Greetings...-Greetings. Have you also come to Zoo? Yes! My husband said, he'll come. - Did he say he'll come? I think he'll not come. He just said he had some work. How can he fail to come after promising? - You shut up. He'll never refuse me. He'll definitely come. Then, we'll wait for some time & go in together. If she waits for her husband there's some meaning to it. If we also wait, how'll it be? You carry on, we'll join you. - Okay. Okay, let's go. We'll go. Hi, sister-in-law. How're you, brother-in-law? - Asking me, how am I? Since I missed you and you had become someone else's Wife. Like Romeo without Juliet. Like Samson without Delilah! ...I'm living lifeless. By the way, how are you? - I'm very happy. Thank God, atleast you're happy. That's enough for me. By the way, where's your husband? - I'm waiting for my husband only. How come you're coming from this side? Whichever side I may've come from... I've come to you, isn't it? Is he your husband? - Yes. Dear, he's my brother-in-law. Why did you marry this already married man? Married man? - Yes. He's already married. His first wife is S.I. Why're you laughing? He too has misunderstood like you. He's thinking me to be our opposite flat man. Opposite flat man? Who's he? Opposite flat lady's husband. Who's that opposite flat lady? - Opposite flat man's wife. Hey, Don't confuse me. He's not confusing, brother-in-law. There's a man who's exactly like him. They're living in our opposite flat only. No, Jhansi, he has another wife. Good! you didn't say that Jhansi has another husband. If you're so suspicious they went inside just now, go & check yourself. He'll check it later. Looks like he's going on some important job. We'll meet later, brother. There's something fishy in this. ...I'll find it out. This is Hippopotamus. Does it take Horlicks every day? - No... why? Then, why is it a flat? Stupid. Dear, did you see him? Where's he? Am I not saying my husband & her husband are 2 different people? No way! Again, blurting out the same word. Without beating me, listen to what I'm saying. Your husband & that Jhansi's husband are one & same. He's appearing as Two, isn't it. Yes. When we are look alikes, how can we appear different without looking same. No... No, you're not two people ...Only one. No! Look here. My husband has Ear ring. Her husband wears specs. Why're you saying man with pocket watch is Gandhi & without is Rajiv Gandhi. If you talk too much, I'll beat you so much that your eyes will pop out. Do whatever you feel like doing me. But, you're playing dual role. And you're over acting. Another tooth. It's me, Jhansi. What? On our nuptial night ...will you disappear? Do you know how much I felt hurt for that? You should feel if I run away without dress, not without address. Don't crack jokes. You made me sleepless all night. Even if I had been at home you would've been sleepless. The Jasmine flowers were troubling me all night. Asking, where's your husband? Where are you exactly? That's in Office... I'm in office. What's this you're at home & telling you're in office? Last night I had night duty and I missed it for your duty. If I say I'm at home, I'll lose my job. Who's on the phone? SP from one Town. - You carry on, sir. Sir? What's this calling me, sir? You're Home Minister, isn't it? I must respect you. Okay, At least today, we're going to have our nuptials or not? I'll try. Try? We must look for an auspicious time etc., isn't it? It seems even today the time is good. Priest said that. That means... What's this, you're talking about auspicious time? For my nuptials. What? Not yet over? He didn't allow it to happen. Who? - My husband only. He's a different type man. He believes in traditions & auspicious time. Is it that the reason or does he have any second wife? No, he's not that sort of a man. In one word, I can say, he's modern day Lord Rama. Men superficially appear like that only. Why do you want to get involved in her personal matters? She has come for some important thing look after that & send her. Our Iron box is broken down. If you lend yours... I'll give... one minute. Come tomorrow morning by 9 to the Court. I'll be there. Don't forget. I'll talk to the Public Prosecutor. Excuse me!- Yes. What's this? -What? When I tried local call, they're saying to try after one day. Who? - Telephone please. They... they're like that only. It has become a fashion of late. Take it. Bye! - Thanks. Thank you very much. You may go. Poor girl! I didn't tell her last she my feel hurt. Definitely her husband would've taken a second wife. Are you sure? Sure! I felt like that on seeing his face. His face is also like mine only, isn't it? Your face and that bloody fool's, face are totally different. Hey! Don't call husband as bloody fool. You'll lose your eyes. Why'll I lose my eyes? I said about that lady's husband? A husband is a husband for any woman, isn't it? What's that? It's like that only, go & get tea for me. Why Tea now, I'll serve food, come. I've prepared your favourite Egg plant curry. Okay, serve & I'll have a go for it. Greetings. - Greetings. Why this lady's husband is sneaking into that lady's flat? That's the story of the Hello Brother. Brother, is it you? What's this story? Don't you know it? He's common husband for those two wives. Atleast tonight our nuptials. My SP says, postpone it by a week. Who's he to decide about our nuptials? He's an expert in astrology. When I asked him he told me. I suspect you from your behaviour. If you've any problem go to Dr.Samaram. I'm cent percent fit. You needn't have any such doubts? Wait for a week. I'll fulfill your desire. I'm just waiting for an auspicious time, that's all. Okay, come, I prepared Egg plant curry, your favourite dish. Come & have lunch. - Did you also prepare Egg plant curry? You're saying, you also! Anyone else had prepared it? Head Constable brought lunch from home since it's Marriage Anniversary. It had the Egg plant curry. that's why, I said like that. Then, did you eat there? I ate little thinking he may feel hurt if I don't eat. Then, why're you sitting again? - Thinking you may feel hurt. You're not sharing my bed. Nothing will go wrong if you don't share food. Get up. - That isn't it, Jhansi? It's me, Archana, where are you? I'm nearby only! Why? Kirlosker & Murari are peeping from the window. I'm scared. - You come here immediately. Okay, I'm coming. Where're you going again? It seems I've to sign some paper in office. I'll be back in a minute. You? What're you both doing here? That's.... we were watching closely since we liked the door colour. Oh! Is it so? Bloody fools! They're here only. What am I to do now? Didn't you go to office? - I'm thinking of skipping. Then, come, cricket match is being shown on T.V. Let's watch it. Is it? Then, I'll come back after changing my clothes. Hey, brother, look there. No doubt. That man is this man. This man is that man only. He's shifting from there to here. Then, why to delay, let's start it. Have you come? Why're they loitering in our & Jhansi's threshold. Time is not good... Whose? - Theirs only. Door is locked. He could you come in? If they see me coming from the front, they'll escape. So, I came from behind scaling the pipeline. Oh! Brother-in-law, is it you? Please, come in. Why is he with you? To tell you a truth. - What? Like a social reformist. One man must've only one wife. Woman is not helpless, but strength, etc Giving such great speeches. You spoiled my family life & sent me to jail, isn't it? What's your husband doing now? - What's he doing? Maintaining 2 wives very near. He's maintaining both of them running families, shifting places. Hey, if you talk any non-sense about him I'll break your teeth. I promise on Temple of Birla Please believe me. Your husband is not just your husband. He's that opposite flat, lady's husband also. Just now, he sneaked into that house right before our eyes. He's playing a double game. - He's playing. When he's at home. Are you saying he has sneaked into opposite flat? Is he at home only? Please, call him out. Dear!...-Dear! Please come out. - Please, come out. What's it, Jhansi? They're accusing you of having 2 wives and sneaking into opposite flat. Since you missed marrying my wife. Since my wife had sent you to jail. Harbouring vengeance, raising doubts between us. Are you trying to break our family? I'll kill you both. No.... No... what we are saying... What the hell are you going to say? If possible unite families don't break them. Get lost. Get out. Brother, what's this? We'll start from that side. Come....-Come. What do you want? - We've come to tell you a real story. What? Do you know, who's that Jhansi of your opposite flat? I know her. Who? she! - My neighbour house lady. There only you've been mislead. She's not neighbour house lady. She's your husband's bed partner. That means, she's your husband's second wife. If you want, go & check there. The husband who should be next to you is with her. With whom? Next to her. Brother, is it our eyes or not? You were there just now. - What am I there & here? Feeling jealousy of made for each other couple. Are you giving false statements? We are like Lord Rama & Seetha.... Your litigations will not succeed. If you say anything non-sense again. Comedy will turn serious. Get out...-Get out... If you believe such fools. - How can I believe them? Don't I know about you & your character? I'll not believe them even if they tell me the truth. Wife means... you're my wife. Stand on those words only. Dear! Dear! Dear! Hey, Are you here? Otherwise did you think, I'll be in the next flat? Why'll I think like that? What are you doing here? I'm seeing the city in it's true nature. Then, wait, I'll bring chairs. We'll sit & gossip. Then, what shall we do now? If we prove that, they're not two but only one. Archana will kill him & go to jail. After that I can marry Jhansi. - Are you dreaming now? No! This is my childhood dream. Plan something & break open his secret. Get up! Did you hurt your head? Have you gone mad? It's not this boy, we were planning to get rid of. His father. Don't I know that? You mad fellow, this is lead scene for that only. Say it properly man. If I say next scene here only. They'll book me for leaking scene. - Come. Greetings madam. You? We're Tribals. - We're Mountain Tribals. We'll tell your future. We'll tell your life's happy & sorrow moments. I don't believe in fortune telling.. Go... Don't get angry, madam Jhanshi. How do you know my name? It's words of Tribal Goddess. Your father's name is Shivaram. - Your husband is a Police Officer. Your life isn't happy even though you're married. Yes, true! Come in. Show me your hand, madam. Hocus - Focus. Abracabra. Your lines predict good fortune. But bad fate has lead you into a tearful life. Say it in detail. Your husband is a good man with a good heart. But for nuptials.... - He escapes. Yes, it's true. Tell me a way out for this problem. Keeping the Goddess's Idol before you. With your husband sitting next to you... Pray for 3 days. 4th night will be your nuptial night. Madam, you'll become pregnant before a month. It's God's order! Your husband shouldn't go out for those 3 days. If he disobeys, he'll die. I'll not allow him to go out at any cost. But, if he wants to go to bathroom and... 30 minutes! He can go out for 30 minutes. If you allow him more than that your husband will die. No, as ordered by you I'll not allow him to go out. God bless you. It's me, Archana. Our son fell down and hurt his head. Severely hurt? 4 stitches! Just now, I've brought him back from Hospital. You come immediately. Okay, I'll come immediately. I'm going home, anything urgent call me at home. Okay, sir. Dear, you're safe, isn't it? Thank God! Now, I'm happy. Do that later! First tell me, why did you come here? I must go out urgently. You mustn't go out anywhere you come home with me. Why? It seems your life is in danger. It seems if you go out your life may be in jeopardy. Who said that? - Mountain Tribals. Fools! They'll say like that only to squeeze out money from you. No, they didn't take a penny also from me. If you stay with me for 3 days. The danger period will pass off and as well as our nuptial night also. We mustn't believe such things. I too didn't believe it initially. But, they told all true things. - No. I never asked anything in past. I'll never ask in future also. Please listen to me for the one last time. Come. Our plan has worked out very well. Now, she'll not leave him out at any cost. If he's one as we are thinking. He can't go to that Archana's house. Mummy, daddy has come. He's not daddy, he's uncle. Sorry!- No problem. How's your son? He's having fever, I think because of that hurt. How do you know that her son is not well? It seems just now she had called her husband. He told me. He said he'll come home immediately, ..but hasn't come yet. Where's he? He got a call from I.G. he went there. He told me to tell you that he'll be coming late. If you need any help, please tell me. - Alright. Come. Don't worry dear, you'll get well soon. You?! ...come in. How's your son? - Fever has increased rapidly. He's babbling for his father. When I called his office, It seems he left yesterday afternoon itself. I'm very scared, where he might have gone. You be brave! I'll go & send him. - Thanks. When her son is unwell? Why're you so concerned as if he's your son? Son is a son for any one, isn't it? I'll go & inform him. How can you go out? They said you're facing danger, isn't it? If anything happens to the kid. - If anything happens to you. Nothing will happen to me. I'll go just like that & come back just like that. You mustn't go out. Don't you feel, pity on seeing that kid. I do feel! But what can we do in such a situation? If we do one thing. What's it? If you take out the specs, if you go as that kid's father. He'll think you as his father his spirits will soar high. And his fever will come down. What's this you're so moved? When you said like a mother I felt like I'm the father. Don't delay. Go immediately. Okay, I'll change my dress & come. Listen, come within 30 minutes. Otherwise, it's danger for your life. Alright. Dear, where did you go away? How's our son? What happened to my dear? I got hurt. Good, he's acting perfectly as the kid's father. I can ask him to try in movies also. Do you know how scared & sad I felt when you didn't turn up? I've come back, isn't it? Oh God! He's over acting. You shouldn't go out till fever comes down. Alright. I'll not go anywhere. I'll stay with you only. I can't stay even a day without you. Silly girl, can I stay? He's committing himself! May be if he goes like that... Oh! Is it you? What's it? I just came to check if your husband had come or not. He came just now. I'm happy! I'll go. - Okay. Come home. Home Minister has come! I'll meet him and come back immediately. Are you going out again? - Daddy, please don't go out. Dear, I'll come back immediately. Come back quickly. Thank God! You came at right time & knocked the door. If not... Would you've run a family with her? Don't you know about my character? Stop your play acting. When I told you to act as the kid's father. Will you act as that lady's husband? I did like that, so that the kid doesn't suspect me. Did he tell you, he'll not believe unless you hug & kiss her. Not even bothering about that she's a mother of a kid..hugging her. You showed a true man's colour. If our nuptials had been over, you couldn't have been tempted. Not that... Don't touch me! Take a bath with Dettol & come. Okay! It was my mistake to believe & send him there. Even after 48 hours, Archana's husband didn't come. Jhansi's husband didn't come out. He's definitely 2 Town. Didn't I tell, they both are one & the same? Just another 24 house only, isn't it? If he comes, okay, otherwise we'll open his secret. We'll break up their families. You bloody, villains, are you planning such a big thing? I'll teach you a lesson. I'll teach. Sir, it's me, Rama koti. Oh God! Why're you calling me again as sir? I'm your sub-ordinate. Should I've to tell you Million times like chanting God's name? Understood sir! Is 2-Town Madam next to you? Yes sir! Tell me the matter, sir. That Kirlosker & Murari have planned to ruin your family life. Bomb? Tell me in detail, sir. Then, I'm coming immediately. What's it dear? What happened? It seems 2 Terrorists have planted bombs in my station. I must go immediately. If anyone plants a bomb one must run away. Why're you saying, you're going there? I must go & defuse them immediately otherwise, it's very danger. You'll be in danger if you go, isn't it? There's a grace time of 30 minutes, isn't it? I'll be safe! I'll come back soon. - Don't go. Dear! I'll be safe. - Please listen to me. I'll come back & listen. - Please, don't go. Please, listen to me!-Don't go. - It's dangerous situation there. - Dear! Where is your husband rushing? It seems some terrorists have planted bombs in his station. His life will be in danger if he goes out, isn't it? How do you know that his life is in danger? You said, Bombs, isn't it? My friend thinks if it explodes his life will be in danger, isn't it? - Yes. I'm also afraid of that only. If you don't go to Archana Madam's house immediately. Your secrets will be out. Then, you do one thing. What's it sir? I'll go as Archana's husband you go to Jhansi as my dupe. What are you blabbering sir? Am I your dupe? - Yes. What is your position & my position? What's your height & my height? What's your style & my stomach? What's your personality & mine? Impossible! I can't go. You'll not go like this. I'll change your shape. No, it'll be unnecessary risk. I'm there, isn't it? When are you not there? You'll be there from the beginning to the end of the movie. I'm just a comedian, what will be my position? Just come with me, without further argument. Don't get scared. One must scare away a husband. Never get scared of a husband. Husband? What do you mean by husband? It's your husband, who's inside that bandage. What happened to him? When he tried to run after defusing bombs to save policemen. It went off. Dear, you went without heeding my warnings. Away... Away. If you hug him in this condition. Apollo doctors have said he may die like a dropped egg. Though I warned your life is in danger, you went brushing it aside. Did you see, what a danger has befallen on you? Since you're very lucky. He came back alive from death. Come, let's take him to home. Come. Be careful. Slowly... slowly... sir. Come. Brother, he's not one man, he's twins. Are you sure, brother? When we are seeing the evidence right before our eyes. Do you still have doubts? They're two! They've two! We're two. Slowly. Sleep slowly. sir. You go & bring the fan. - Alright. Without getting up, you sleep like that only for 4 days. What about my food, sir? When I come to see you, I'll feed you. Take care of him carefully. Thanks. Dear! How's our son? He's blabbering your name only. Dear, come to me. You mustn't go out till our son's fever comes down. Okay! I've assigned my duty to another person. No need for me to go to 2 Town for the present. Great man! He survived even a bomb blast also. Great survivor. I must marry my aunt's daughter at any cost. Tell me any idea, brother. If he's in full strength he'll bash us both. Now, he's 90% dead with the bomb blast. If we beat that balance 10%. He'll die. After that you can marry Jhansi. Then, come! let's kidnap and kill him. Dear, you went without heeding my warnings. Look, how much you're suffering now? Get up. I can't sleep, if I get up. I'll help you to sleep come on, get up. Drink juice. I've already had 6 times I can't drink anymore. Don't say like that dear. You're not having food, isn't it? You'll become weak. Come on have it. - Oh! No, I don't want, madam. Calling me, madam? - Did I call you as madam? I might've called. After this bomb blast, I'm blabbering with everyone. Even your account seems to be different. That's the effect of the Bomb. I broke my face & bit my tongue. Oh God! If anything happens to you, who's there for me? He only! Who else? Who's he? He... means God. Okay, have it. Why're you shivering? When it's giving me shock How can I stop from shivering? I'm very impatient! Please stay away from me. Sorry... sorry, madam. Why're you saying sorry for this silly thing? Wait, I'll change my saree & come. No.... No... No.. What happened to you dear? Don't change clothes infront of me. I can't stop myself. Why? Are you feeling shy? No, I'm scared. Why're you scared? I'm beautiful, isn't it? That's why, I'm scared. Why're you scared? I'm not a stranger, isn't it? Look, if you go on do like this, then I may be forced to betray my boss. Boss? - Who's your Boss? My Doctor! He has advised me not to watch even Star T.V. You go & change in the next room or else I may get emotional. Is that you're concerned about? Then, wait. Thank God! I'm saved for the present. I wouldn't have accepted to come if I know such scenes were there. If situation continues to prevail like this. Oh! God! I'm damn sure to cross the civility line. Sure. Hey, what's this? Why're you shouting like a small kid? Sit tightly for sometime! Pain will come down automatically. Oh! God! They're wearing veils. Hey, Who're you both? Who are you? God! Please leave me.-Leave him. Leave him Where are you taking him? I'm finished. - Who are you? Leave him. Anybody. Help me. What are those shrieks? Looks like, it's Jhansi's voice. Oh! God! May be he's doing something getting tempted by Jhanshi. Help me. Jhansi, what happened? Someone is taking away kidnapping my husband. - Who? I don't know. Save him. Oh My God! I had decided Jhansi as my wife before she was born. Are you trying to get into her bed by becoming her husband? When I'm beating him so seriously why's he laughing like a comedian? May be his cries are like laughs. Go ahead with 2 more rounds. Go ahead... go ahead man. This side... that's side. Everyone come & join to beat him. Hit me.. I'll not feel anything. Hit me. It's very pleasant. - Stop... stop. Now, I've understood why he's laughing without crying? Why? When he's covered by a thick bandage how can he feel pain? Is that? That's it. Remove all the bandage & beat him. No... No... please don't remove the bandage. Why? Are you not wearing any clothes inside? I'm not wearing even an underwear also. No problem, we all are men only, isn't it. Remove it, boys. No... No... don't remove bandage. Oh God! They're removing bandage. Brother-in-law, what's this? Sir, please save me Please save me. Hey, Brother-in-law. Dear! Leave me. No.... No... please don't remove my bandage, wait man. Hey, why is he dragging me? Don't remove my bandage. Shut up. You'll die a merciless death. Leave me!-Don't shout. Hey, stop. Come. Sir, save me. He's removing entire bandage. Wait... wait... wait. Slipped again from me. Stop. Sir, save me. Save me, sir. Just one bandage only. Don't strangle my neck. I'll die. - It's better for you to die. Sir, save me. Come quickly. Sir, come quickly. You? Why did you come in this disguise? Why did you cheat me? It isn't he who cheated you. It's him. Where's my husband? After reading entire Bible, why're you asking who's Christ? You both were happy feeling, you both have husbands separately. But you married & shared only one husband. He's this man only. Who's she to you? She's my wife. She? She's also my wife. You've heard, isn't it? Our job is over with this scene. Now, the one day match will begin. They'll decide who'll bowl & who'll bat by tossing a coin. We'll sit in the gallery & watch the match... come. Why did you cheat me? Why did you betray me? Neither I cheated anyone nor betrayed anyone. May be he has become an artiste in the drama played by the fate. Tell me, why did you marry me as second wife? Wasn't I a good wife to you? Listen to what I'm saying without getting excited. Everyone forced me to marry after I thought you were dead. Why didn't you tell me that? Thinking that I'll refuse. If I know you're already married? Thinking that I'll reject you? I knew after our marriage that they hid this fact from you. Atleast you should've told me later. Why didn't you tell me? If I felt... Were you afraid that I'll leave you? Or did you hid it not to miss the chance of having me? If I say after sometime. They'll resign to their fate. Did you think of enjoying life with 2 wives? Not like that. Archana, atleast you try to understand me. You married her thinking, I'm dead. - That means... Don't I have a place in your heart? You don't love me. - What's this Archana? If you had loved me, you wouldn't have thought about marrying again. You wouldn't have married again. - Please listen to me. Don't touch me. The moment you tied knot with her. Our relationship is over that moment itself. Your Archana is really dead that moment itself. Live with her only. Accept her only as your wife. I don't want a man who has lost his chastity. I want a chaste husband only. You've ruined my C.I's family. I'll come back as Hero in the next film & see your end. Be careful. What have you done? Don't talk, you don't have any right to talk. I'm your mother. Are you a mother, who gets her daughter's husband to marry again. You've brought a second wife to my husband. Are you my mother? If you're a mother, why did you get your son-in-law married again? After your death, fearing, he'll die in sorrow. I got him married. Is it wrong? - Definitely, it's wrong. What do I lack? Am I lame or squint? Why should I become a second wife? Will you spend all your life without a husband? Will you live without a male partner? Can't I live without a male partner? Do women only need husband? Don't men need wife? If I marry again will he accept or bear it? Shut up. Why do you compare men with women? Does man has any special horns or fell from heaven? We too eat the same food eaten by them. The same blood flows in us also. A deserted wife is looked down and ridiculed. Will they praise and pray a deserted husband? He doesn't want a wife, He's desiring a woman. That means, Are you going to leave him? Otherwise, do you want me to live with him by leaving my self respect? Three knots... seven steps... 4 walls. Do you want me accept these as the boundaries of a woman? Do you want to accept a man who'll sleep with me one day with her next day? Am I a wife? Second wife? or a Prostitute? On which basis or right do you want me to live with him? A man who has another wife can never became my husband. That means... - I'm disowning him as my husband. I'll take divorce from him. What's that? Lawyer notice? Who sent it? Your daughter-in-law. Why? It seems they want divorce. Why're you feeling sad? It's they who should feel ashamed of going to the Court. They should cry for losing a good husband like you. When women are so stubborn... ..You're a man! How much stubborn you should be? When they don't need you? Even you don't need them. Till now, I followed your words. Now, you'll follow my words. A deserted woman may not get a new husband. But a man will get lakhs of women. You marry again. People will stop spitting on earth. It's they who brought the situation of getting spitted up on. When you're going through hell unable to forget them. They're planning to watch it joyfully. If you marry again, it'll be like hitting with a slipper on the face of dogs. Do you want me to marry for revenge? Or will you cry with their photo in your hand? I'm going through hell for one mistake. I'll never commit that mistake again in my life. Then, do something which you'll never done. Start a new habit. Take this. Become a drunkard like me. Forget your sorrows & responsibilities. Better than getting insulted as a husband deserted by a wife. Become a drunkard respectfully. At least then, I'll be happy as a father. Take it. Come out. Come out. Brothers & sister. Look at them. She's my first wife. She's my second wife. Hey, why're you staring me? For having come drunk? I didn't come drunk. You made me a drunkard. You overstretched a thing to the point of break. And made me a drunkard. Will you both divorce me? Is ours a marriage or game of cards? To play & drop it in the mid game. What was my betrayal? Is it coming from my first night as soon as you came back? Will any other man come like that? Ask them to tell? Thinking you were dead, I became like a mad man. Since you're coming into my eyes I close my eyes. Sleepless... Without food... I spent my days. I wanted to come to you after death. Unable to forget my dead mother, my father who became a drunkard. Your life shouldn't become like my life. I've seen what will be the affect of losing a wife. When he forced me to marry again. Unable to hurt a father with my death. I lived on only to marry her. Not in the lust for her beauty, complexion or.. Is it a crime? Is it a sin? Hey, This year's NO.1 chaste woman of South India. What about you? Are you feeling insulted for getting an already married husband? Did I drunk before? Did I touch you? Did I get into your bed with lust? Did I enjoy you? Even after marriage, I left you as a virgin. If I had been a rogue. If I was a man with lust for women. I wouldn't have left you a virgin. But, why didn't I do like that? Why didn't I leave my morals? Because Archana was living in my heart as my wife. You're going on harping about failing to tell the truth. Do you know, why I didn't tell? No one is ready to marry my daughter. If I say it's second marriage she'll refuse. When your father came & cried with my father. They lied to me and made me tied the knot. When your father failed to tell you the truth? Why should I tell? When she came back alive I knew that they didn't tell you the truth. If I say I'm already married & my wife has come back from death. I didn't tell you, fearing you'll die in shock. What about you my all India chaste wife? Lord Rama tested by fire Seetha who stayed in Lanka for 9 months. The same Lord sent his pregnant wife to exile for a fool's words. Your favourite God. When you were missing for 25 months. Where were you? What were you doing? With whom did you stay! Did I ask you like that? No! Did I suspect you? No. Wife means love! Wife means belief! Wife means trust! Who didn't have it, your Lord Rama or your husband? Come on, tell me! When you turned Lord Rama into God & dedicated in temple. Will you throw me on to the street as a stone? You may be a wife for Namesake only. I loved you more than my parents. But, atleast you haven't given me the value equal to your son.You great mother! Unable to render justice to two wives. I got distressed! I feared what will happen to you if you come to know the truth. I cried your part also so that you shouldn't shed a tear. After doing all this, are you going to divorce me? Actually... You come into position. Come! If you disown me, did you think I'll fall at your feet? When you've decided you don't want me! Why do you still need those auspicious threads? Are you planning to live happily as Ex-wives with it's safety. I'll not give you that chance. Not as wives with auspicious threads. But wives with snapped auspicious threads. Like widows! I'll see that you'll wear white sarees. Without giving the divorces, I'll leave you as widows. I'll make you cry all your life. Stop! Don't you like me dying also? You must live. You must live a long live happily! Not without love on you. Not without knowing about you. Thinking you & Jhansi shouldn't be punished unjustly because me. I suspected & insulted you. I wanted to go away from you! So, I chose divorce! I became your wife! I became mother of your son. At least for some time I had lived happily with you. But Jhansi. She didn't get anything as a wife except the auspicious thread. Please give her a place in your heart as wife. No sister! If you do like that, not only you lose a husband. You're making your son also lose a father. He married only you with love. He loved only you. I don't have a place in heart only you've! Even if you force me to become his wife. I can get his body but I can't share his heart! Wife's position is always yours. When you both have so much of affection on each others! Thinking about each other's welfare... Don't spoil your lives! Like sisters be happy and make him happy. Forgive me! Archana only is my wife Jhansi can never be my wife. Yes, father. He must always be like Lord Rama. That Lord Rama has only a Seetha. And that Seetha... ...ls my sister! Then, what about your life? I'll marry again. Without bothering about me you both live happily. From today, only she's your wife.
