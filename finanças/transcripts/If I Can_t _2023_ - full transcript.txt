You know, I'm just one cheeseburger away from being a fat bitch. I know that, you're lying. What? It's a good thing, you married somebody who loves cheeseburgers and will buy you all new clothes. You cannot afford to buy me new clothes. We can barely afford clothes for that baby. Well, your baby daddy got that promotion at work. Yep, you know what that means? What? More money, insurance, and more time to spend with y'all. Always say you think you will. That's why I'mma get you whatever you want because you believed in me. Just watch. I love you, Emory. I love you too. I just put her down there. Oh, okay. How was work, papa? Work was work. How's the most beautiful girl in the world? I'm better now that my king is home. Come here. Oh baby.

All the stuff that I can't fit any more, thanks to him, and him. I told you get rid of some clothes not pile them all in the front room. I mean, this look crazy. Oh mama, speaking to that. You think you can watch the baby while we go drop this off at the Salvation Army? Of course, I can. Yes, I care for you baby- How did you know I don't wanna get out of the house with you?
