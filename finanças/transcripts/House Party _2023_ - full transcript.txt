♪ Now, wait a minute ♪ in the city, of la ♪ they're poplocking, woo I know for most people, a house party is just a kick-back to catch up with the homies. But this is la, a city where a party can change your life. A place where legends are born, die, and live again. And bein' rich or bein' broke can be separated by a mere freeway. But once in a great while, the stars align, and the fates bless a few fortunate dreamers with a night that will change the course of their lives forever. In other words, there's some crazy, beautiful, weird-ass shit about to go down. One and two and three and four. The fuck? Destiny, what you think? I know it sound weird, but let's see what daddy cooked up. This beat feel good! It feel free! I'm the goat! Sellin' out stadiums! Platinum records! Yeah, that's my baby on the track. You hear that? That's you. Yo, come on. Look who decided to wake up. Did you sign the start forms for the it job yet? I'MMA get on that Monday. You ain't got all the time in the world because in three months, your mother and I will be enjoyin' our retirement. Spoonin' each other on the Sandy beaches of Daytona, Florida. And this house will be sold, so... did you find anywhere to live yet? Once I start my new job, I'll have the money to get a new place. I mean, you could just lend me the money. Yeah, right. When I was raised, you think anybody was just goin' around giving me money? You don't know what it was like in la in the '90s. Don't let this house fool you. Half this shit we got in the riots, right baby? You ain't lyin'. I said, "lend," pop. Dang. Oh, I saw Mrs. Bailey at vons yesterday. How is Venus doing? Good, I guess. I mean, I think she live near leimert park, now. You two were like twins in middle school. - Remember that? - No, I don't remember that. I thought you two might have been datin' until she went to prom with that football player. I follow him on Facebook, too. He is more handsome now than ever. You don't ever talk to Venus at work? Not really. She work in the main office. I see her when I'm dropping off keys to a house or... Picking up my check. That was nice of her to help you get that job. But stupid of you to help Damon get his. Jesus is my friend. Yeah, he's my friend. Damon! Damon, wake your lazy ass up. Damon! I know you gotta work today. And clean up this room, too. It smell like ass and onions in here. Damon! All right, I'm up already, man. Damn. Jeez. That's what you get, stayin' out partyin' all night. Mm-hmm. You think you can live playing pick-up basketball and clubbing and fucking up my house? See now I know why your mama kicked your ass out. Aunt Jean, for the last time, all right... It's not clubbing. I'm a promoter. I'm working, all right? People followin' me on Instagram and comin' to my parties. - Oh, really? - Yeah. - Did you make any money? - There she go. Oh, I get it. It's a non-profit. You're doing charity work. Boy, if you're in a club and not making any money, then it's clubbin'. You must think I'm stupid. Don't forget, you owe me rent, plus last month's. 'Cause next stop is gonna be skid row for you. Talkin' about followers. You know who got followers? Jesus. Mm-hmm. Take your rude ass to work, and clean up that room. Smell like somebody fucked an onion. Oh, my god, aunt Jean, you just cursed. What would Jesus say? Jesus would say, "shut the fuck up, this is my house!" Man! Hey, beautiful. Don't make me get my gun. Oh, shit. Let's get you to your mom's house. See, what granny and paw-paw don't know is... Is that I'm about to make a lot of money from this party. And we gonna have everything we need. Have all the toys you need. Hey! Hey, what's going on? What y'all doin'... - Where Damon at? - I don't know. Y'all know he doesn't live here. We gonna burn his nigga house down. - Larry, chill. - Whoa. What? I got my daughter with me. I tried to call y'all twice this week about the party. Y'all ain't returning my calls. Y'all dickheads off the party. - Guile? I got this. - Hmm. - Okay? - Yeah, yeah. 'Cause y'all dickheads off the party. Yeah, I heard him. But why? You know exactly why! We're gonna make you pay. - First we gonna tie you up, right? - Mm-hmm. Then we'll cut your little nappy head off - with a rusty machete. - Whoa. - Yeah. - Then I'm gonna sew your Booty hole up. I'm gonna take some Mexican candy, the spicy kind. Then I'm gonna shove it down your throat till you're nice and plump. And then I'm gonna beat your ass like a pinata. Larry... Larry, let's just calm down. Hey. Hey. I need you to really work on dialing back your threats. - Dial it back? - You put too much sauce on it! - Too much sau... - What you mean, too much... A pinata? Y'all off the party! You and that little weirdo Vic, and that's that! Y'all can't do that, man. We got money invested. You can thank your home boy, Damon. Never liked that roach-face-ass nigga, anyway. Yeah, he tried to play my baby cousin, tried to get away with it? And steal from her? What you mean? He stole from her? Daisy can't find her gold necklace. And I know that little crackhead-ass boy Damon took it. We're gonna fuck his ass up on sight. - On sight, boy. - Yeah. That's right. Then we gonna grind his dick into a juice. Make him drink that shit. - Okay, no, no. - What's left over, that's for you. We just talked about you dialin' this back. - What did I do? - We're not juicin' no dicks today! You know what? I quit! - Oh, you quit? - I quit! Do it yourself! - You did this same shit in the third grade. - So? Just get the fuck outta here, man! - Guile! - Huh? I got this! Between the both... why... I got it. Get the fuck outta here. Get yo' ass in the back. What you doin'? I thought you quit. You got short legs. You interrupt me one more time, I keep tellin' you. Every time I speak, you wanna speak. Quit speakin'! Hey. What's up with it, y'all? It's your boy, damonthadon. Just wanna hit y'all with a bit of morning motivation. Lot of people trying to stress you out. But don't let the bullshit get to you, all right? Do whatever it is that makes you happy. Smoke a little weed, a little meditation. Maybe a party. Y'all know we got a big one comin' up, so, make sure y'all pull up. Until then... it's regular. Damon! Damn, man! Always hating. Here I come! Fuck. Hey, armen. Sorry I'm late, man. The 405 crazy. Somebody famous live here? Jesus, I'm so glad I won't have to deal with you anymore. These areas are marked and locked. They are not to be tampered with. Kevin will return the keys when you're done. He's the responsible one. Man. I have another site to get to. Bye, Damon. It's Damon, bro. The French way. Stupid. Shit ain't that hard. Damn, man, this how the other half live, huh. Hey! God damn, man. I see you late as usual. Yeah, you know, I got caught up in the clubhouse, schoolin' niggas on how to be successful and not have to work a basic job. Hey, how's my goddaughter, destiny? She fine. She's at her mom's house. Man, armen was acting weird as hell, bro. Actin' hella sketchy about who's crib this is. I guess you ain't heard we got kicked off the party tomorrow. What the fuck is that supposed to mean? Kyle and them is pissed. They don't like you doggin' their cousin Daisy. Daisy? Light-skinned Daisy? That's they cousin? Shit. I'd be pissed, too. But they can't kick us off the party, though, kev. We put money in! I'm the host! I told you, stop messing with that girl. She started liking me too much. That shit... It just turn me off, you feel me? I'm like, "you want me? Me?" I'm still in my ho phase, bro. Man, they said you stole her chain. Man, that's cap! That's big cap! That's bottle cap! That's Colin kap! - That's cap-tain america! - Yo! Nobody want that fugazi raggedy-ass swap meet chain, anyway. Chain's not worth shit. Damn, that shit just fluffed itself. Whose crib is this, man? Steve Jobs? - Steve Jobs is dead, fool. - Don't mean his house died. There goes the money I invested. I got shit to pay for. Have to pick up some extra shifts. That might not even be enough. I know, right? They payin' us Mexican prices out here. Hey, my bad, Juan. I'm Venezuelan. Hey, nobody said you wasn't, Juan. Come on, let's knock this house out. I ain't got all day. I gotta get home in time to read to destiny and drop the keys off. Armen must think you a slave, huh? He know better not to try that shit with me. I'll knock his ass out. Hey, v. It's crazy you called. My mom's... What the hell is wrong with you? Oh, nothin', I'm good. Corporate is in there right now, watching a video of you and Damon smoking at the house on baylor street. That don't even sound like us. This is serious, Kevin. They are short on staff today, so, they're gonna let you clean that last house, but you are getting terminated officially, first thing Monday morning. Maybe we can talk to 'em and change their mind, or somethin'. I need this job. These niggas fired. - No, y'all "fired" fired. - Hey, Venus! I gotta go. Sorry. Sorry, kev. Who was that? Little girlfriend, Venus? Hey, bro, let's spark up. Why you standing there like you shit yourself? - We fired. - What? How? To be honest with you, fuck this job. You're way too talented for this, kev. What you should do is focus on them beats. The shit you sent me today, now, that shit was hard. I ain't mean to mess up your money, though, man. My bad, dawg. But you'll figure this shit out. You always do. What if we threw a house party? Where? Auntie crib? I mean, that shit could work, but... She got these low-ass ceilings, and she got this cat that be throwin' up every time it smell weed, so... No, not like a regular house. People are tired of us throwin' the same party. Every time. We need something... different. Something bigger. Something like this place. You trying to throw a party here? Not here. - Armen would kill us, man. - True. We could rent something out like this. Rent? Oh, hell, no. That would be terrible for our margins, dawg. Plus, my followers? Here? Shit. Niggas ain't got no respect for a nice place like this. I don't know. I gotta figure something out, though. I need ten g's by next week. My parents about to sell the house. If I don't pay for my daughter's fancy preschool, char could make a case to get full custody, and I ain't having that shit. Man, all right. All right. All right, man. Damn. You ain't gotta convince me. I was in the moment you said... "Damon... please, I need your help." - I didn't even say that. - Man! I could hit up my fan base, we could make 10,000 off cover charges, easy. All right. Enough hypothesizing. I'll call around. Let's get to work. Damn. This nigga love to work. Shit. Jab. Jab. Spin. Yeah, that ain't a travel. That's good. Hey, Sabrina? Yeah, remember we threw that Halloween party last year? Oh, look... I'm throwing another party this weekend, and I need a venue. Damn. This dude got his own museum. Damn. She thick. Whew! I would. Dude got Miami shit, Cleveland shit, la shit. It's like, damn, pick a city, bro. Man, you could actually fuck in here, bro. Yeah. Yeah! Conforming to body. Yeah, this is nice. Oh! Ewe. What the fuck? Is this motherfucker a giant? Damn. Two weeks meditation? This dude gotta be stressed. Who is this bro? Buddy is on LeBron's nuts. Oh, my god. I know it's last minute, but you gotta have something. Yes, sir! Yeah, I understand. These promoters talking a lot of shit about us. - We're being blackballed. - Well, fuck all that, bro. Why is you still cleaning? Might as well get this last check. Fuck that, kev! What you doing, man? They got cameras in here! Don't worry about that shit, kev. I found the camera room and I turned all them shits off. You forgot I worked at geek squad, huh? Whose jacket you got on? Check it out. It's LeBron's. LeBron who? James, nigga! There is only one LeBron on earth! Why you got on his clothes? 'Cause this his house. Mmm. This him, kev! This him! This all him. This... man, look, man! This is his candle. Smell like game time in this motherfucker. Look, man, this is his... This is his fridge, kev! Look! This his juice. This juice is LeBron juice, bro! Get some of this greatness in your life, goddammit. You fucking kidding me right now? Shut the fuck up. Yep. Told you. - Hey, there. - Oh! You are one handsome, philanthropic motherfucker. - Who, me? - Your hairline is perfect. Anyone who says otherwise is just jealous. Bro, he got a hologram of himself, just to give him compliments? Yeah, that do make sense, though. The only person that could convince him he the greatest... Is the greatest. You handled the decision to go to Miami perfectly. Nah! That's cap. This guy. Damon. Stop touchin' shit, man. Man, what, man? Shut up, bro! Your scary ass, bro. Oh, damn, I need a face ID. Shit. Hey, Talk, man. You were great in trainwreck. In fact, Ian crouch of the new yorker said you were the funniest person in the movie. Damn, we got all of LeBron's contacts in here. Pretty much everybody in the world. Man, shut up, bro. Even got Carole baskin in here, bro. Should we invite her to our party? Yo! Yo. Yo! Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo yo, kev! Yo! Kev, yo! Yo, yo, yo. Yo! Yo! How about... We throw the party... here? Bro, that was a bad idea before. - It's a terrible idea now. - What? Your NBA 2k rating should be 100, not 97. Yeah. Come on, man. It's the perfect idea, bro. Who wouldn't want to party in the king's house? To become a champion, you must think like a champion. Listen to LeBron, man! Look, it's perfect, dawg. Look. We just hit up all his contacts. As LeBron's assistants. We say that LeBron throwing a secret party on some low key shit. You want to trick famous people into thinking LeBron throwing a party? In his own house? - Hell, yeah! - Man. We can charge way more at the door with these celebs coming, all right? We can make ten times the money, kev. We can send destiny to preschool, high school, college... whatever. What about his family? Somebody could show up. - We can go to jail. - Your scary ass. You worried about the wrong things, kev. Look. Right here. They on vacation. - He meditating for two weeks. - Two weeks? Must be stressed. I would be, too if I was about to hit my 30th season. Look, bro. It's simple, all right? We could throw the party, have it cleaned, without him even knowing. Man, I don't know. Hey, hey, man. Hey, hey! This is not about us, kev. It's not about you. It's not about me. You know who it's about? Destiny. Lil' baby. She can't read. She can't write. 'Cause she can't go to school. - Why? Because you broke. - Shut up. But you can change that, kev. You could make it happen. All right? Yeah, you see it. Now... are we doing this? Or are we doing this? Come on, now. Say yes. Say yes, kev. - This shit gotta be spotless. - It's gonna be sparkling, bro. - Yeah... - We doin' it. We doin' it. Yeah, my boy! You know what that means, right? Looks like we about to throw a house par... Excuse me. We're done in the living room. Oh. Okay, for sure. You can leave the cleaning supplies by the door. - Yeah. - Yeah. Dawg, you about to get... Which door? The one over here? Just the one over... Not that one, the one right over... There's so many doors in the house. Yo, Juan, get the fuck out of here, bro! You ruining the special moment between me and my man, bro. - Sorry. - You and Gloria can leave. We'll lock up. Thanks, man. Yeah, come on, bro. Man, this is what we do, man. We throw parties, bro. I'm gonna make some calls. About to get it crackin'. Shit, I'MMA call diddy. Of course, puffy, diddy, Sean, Mr. Love. Yeah. Ciroc only. We put the dj booth right here, vip area upstairs. We can get sly and reg to do security. Hell, yeah. We need somebody good to clean this place so we don't get caught. - We can do it. - Naw, someone good. You right. You right. All right, we're gonna tell everybody no phones, no social media. The theme is for LeBron and all the guests to play dumb if it's ever brought up again. We're gonna call it, "off the grid part two." "Off the grid part two"? So, people think they missed the first one. People would love to have Dr. Dre on the ones and twos. Oh! This is Dr. Andre Liebowitz? Oh, my bad. My bad. No, I do not need a hair transplant. Oh, my god. Then we invite all the celebrities and regular people too, and charge them more. Man, we about to be the biggest promoters in town. Blanket. Popcorn. Bro. You really think LeBron's installing popcorn in his goddamn cinema... - Hey, yo. - Yeah? I think we'll be good if we keep the party to the living room. Everything else is off limits. Yeah, we can just party-proof it like we did that pajama jam we threw at my granny house. Exactly. Plus, all the good stuff is packed into the restricted areas, anyway. Word. Nigga, this shit about to be crackin'. I'm talking about legendary. I even booked us some performers, too. - Who? - Migos! How the hell you do that? Told quavo he can play LeBron one on one. - He believed it? - Of course not. But he said he coming. Shit, I was thinking he could freestyle over one of your beats. Nah, man, I'm still uncomfortable playin' my shit after what happened. This the one? Hey, nigga. Turn this weak-ass shit off. I got a customer out here. Yo, this shit really is trash, bro. Fuckin' weirdos. Can't lowride to this, nigga. This ain't dre. You gotta get over that, bro. Dude was recording in the back of a cell phone shop. No, I still don't want to do it, though. That shit fucked me up. All right, whatever, bro. Look... I'm gonna drop a fake set of keys off to the office now. And I'm gonna give Venus the real set, after the party. Man, we about to be kings in the king's castle, dawg. Poof! Mm-hmm. We got a lot to do. All right. Focus on the important stuff. Yo! What the fuck? My fault, bro. Shit. Damn. Keep your feet off my damn car. Come on, kev. Let's get to work. Start with the back yard. ♪ Oh, god... Yup. It's that rapper weed.

Wait, Venus. Don't leave! Don't... Don't leave! V, I know this is crazy. But you know me. I wouldn't do something like this unless I was desperate. I gotta pay for my daughter's school.

Okay, I see you, sis. Kevin, this is a really, really bad idea. It's kinda dope, though, right? - I mean, we in LeBron's house. - Yeah. He probably sat right here and contemplated on killing j.R. Smith. I'm contemplating killing you right now. Come on, v. Relax. Why does everyone keep telling me to relax? I mean, you probably should just relax a little bit. I mean, you be a little tense. Look, but I'm serious. I know this is crazy, but a night like this don't come around more than once. Yeah, whatever. As soon as she's over this shit, we leaving. You impressed yet? I'm getting there.

Don't lie to me. I swear. Music has always been your calling. You still making beats? From time to time, fucking around with Damon. To be real, making beats is a waste of time if I ain't making bread. I should focus on something real. One of my uncles in New Orleans actually does music. And no matter what life threw at him, he never gave up. I'm sure if he can make his dreams come true... You definitely can. What about you? I remember my mom made me go to those little ballet recitals you did for Christmas. You didn't give up on your dream, did you?

Well, thank you for having my back, though. - I got you. - Yeah? Oh, my god. It's so cute. What the fuck is this? Oh, my god. I needed this, man. Wow. After off the grid 2, life changed for a whole lot of people. Damon was sentenced to a year, but after LeBron read cudi's poem, he reached a plane above enlightenment, and convinced the judge to release him early. Mya was there to pick him up when he got out. Don't know how he pulled that. Angel... Those janky-ass promoters got arrested for trying to sell LeBron's ring on offerup. Hope somebody beat they ass. Mika moved in with Peter, and his koala started liking her more than him. She's thinking about bringing Marley back to Houston. I guess the joke's on him now. Venus and I took the leap and moved in together. And after the party, she decided to focus on dancing full-time. And Vic finally made it back to our timeline and vowed to stick to hennessy from now on. As far as the money we made, we ended up giving it all back to LeBron for fucking up his house. That nigga's so rich he just donated it to charity. - You did this? - Yeah, yeah. Thanks to Damon, though, I ended up selling one of my beats to big Sean and hit-boy. That made me enough money to send destiny to preschool, high school and college. I guess Venus was right. Dreams are worth chasing. And as far as our new friend... Yeah. I'm back, baby. Looks like we about to throw a house... Excuse me? ...Party. What y'all think this is worth? About 48,762 dollars and... You been watching antiques roadshow,huh? Did you fart? No, that was... that was... Yeah, that was me. Cut. We've been locked in the house all year. We're trying to get naked on a beach. Smoke weed. Talk to a parakeet. Maybe have his kids land on my erect penis, I don't know. They might think it's a tree or something. Got kids in here, nigga. I just wanted to chat him up and maybe get him to sign something, if you know what I mean. Hey, man, come on. Oh, no, no guys. It's a laker Jersey. - Right. - That's my wire. - Right, man. He the feds, yo! - I'm the feds! I posted two black squares on my Instagram, by the way. Just to let you know how blm I am. One for me, one for Marley. Because we are... we're down. I was gonna go to the protest. - But...? - I didn't go. I came up with this fire-ass movie idea, okay? It's five heartbeats meets demolition man. Same director. It's the five heartbeats meets Jurassic park. It's roots backwards. So, instead of roots, it's called trees. My hosting shit really starting to take off, too. I got all my famous... Yeah, my hosting shit gonna go up, too. I got all my... Sorry, the water keep going in my nose. One more time. You would've been a phenomenal baseball player, by the way. That headband makes you look 20 years younger. Someday, you'll be the governor of Ohio. How many teams you think we can win championships with? Drake finally asked for that feature, didn't he? It's taco Tuesday! You handsome devil, you. I don't? I don't? You got your balls on camera for no reason. Balls on camera. Shit.

Get your marasupal-ass away from me, man. Marasup... What is it, "marasupial?" Yeah. Get your marasup... Wait. I can't even pronounce that word. Say it again? - Marsupial. - Marsupial, all right. Yeah, say the word again? - Marsupial. - All right, marsupial. The fuck is up with this Mara-supial... Marsupial motherfucker, man? Fuck. Your letter was just so touching and poetic. I had to meet the person who wrote it. Cut, I'm blushin' too much. Shit. Oh, please. Hey, why is this nigga playin' beats at a party? - You say... - I forgot what I... Is my dawgs in this motherfucker? Hell, yeah! Everybody trying to add a little bit of bass in they voice, ain't they? Yeah! Hell, yeah! Y'all niggas don't sound like that! We got a big problem.
