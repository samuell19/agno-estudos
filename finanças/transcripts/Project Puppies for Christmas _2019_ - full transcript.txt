Look at them. They wage war amongst themselves destroying the planet that was created for them. They're vain and selfish, concerned with only themselves. I say let them go. Plunge them into the darkness they so richly deserve. You think they are not worth protecting. Yes! There is more to them than you turn your eyes to now. They have lost their faith, their righteousness. They wallow in misguided notions of political correctness. They have no morality. Perhaps it is you that has lost your faith. Spend time among them. Find good. It's there, sometimes in the most unexpected places. Okay, Alex. We've gotten almost everything done. I still have to go to the bank and then maybe we can... Let's go in and look at the puppies, Nana. Ah, you know we can't have a puppy, Alex. Let's go in, please? Well, I suppose so but only for a minute. I need to get to the bank. Are you getting a puppy? No, our papa owns this store. We're just playing with them. That must be fun, always having puppies to play with. Well hello there. How are you? Good, thank you and you? Excellent. I'm finding homes for all these little bundles of energy. So I'm doing very excellent. We have the finest pedigrees. Aren't you sad to see the puppies go? When I was a boy I worked in an animal shelter. I remember there were so many dogs, too many. That was sad. Now, I just only get enough puppies so I can get enough loving homes for all of them. And a portion of my profit goes to the animal shelter to help the other dogs, too. Oh, this is a cute one. How much? $750 and that includes all insurance and papers. Oh, I'm sorry, Alex, we have to go. I have to get to the bank. Okay. Bye puppy. Rick, come on in. Thank you for coming. Oh, good to see ya, sis. You too. I have some coffee ready. Good. So where's Alex? At her friend Peyton's house. So what did you wanna see me about? Is it about Alex? When did I start having to come up with a reason to spend some time with my favorite baby brother? You're getting forgetful, sis. I'm your only baby brother. Oh, that's right. No, I'm just a little down, wanted some company. Alex is fine but she's wanting a puppy and they cost $700 minimum. With the food costs and Social Security, I just don't think I can spend the money on a puppy. I wish I could help but Brian's med school expenses are eating my lunch financially and my dinner. Of course it is, I understand. I just thought I would ask. What's with you? I don't know. I just wish I could get a puppy for Christmas. We could ask your Nana to get it for you. I already did. She says we don't have the money to get a puppy. Yeah, I asked my dad for one, too. I got the it's too much responsibility shutdown. I've got it! Let's ask Santa! Really? What makes you think we'll actually get a puppy? Simple, we just do a good deed and Santa will be so impressed, he'll go through hoops to get us a puppy. I guess. No, it's guaranteed. Now, all we have to do is come up with a good deed. It'll have to be a big one. Ah, for crying out loud. All right, you kids, that's enough. Now, you come by here and I saw you hit my rocks. Leave my rocks alone. Yeah? Go on, get outta here. Yes, sir. Yes sir, yes sir, yes sir. Delinquents. Let's bring Christmas joy to Nilwater! What? You said big, not impossible. I think we could do it. In this century? We can if we come up with a plan. Well, whatever it is, we have to act fast! Christmas is in like a week. Project: Puppies for Christmas! Yeah! Thank you for shopping with us. Good morning, Mr. Davis. Don't ring anything up twice. I'm watching. Of course not, Mr. Davis. You're ringing it up too fast for me to see the screen as items get rung up. Slow down. Yes, Mr. Davis. I want everything double bagged. The plastic's so thin one bag rips. Double bagged, yes, sir. That's 24.31, please. Uh, you forgot something. The, what is it hazelnut? Oh that's my favorite, too. Oh yes, I didn't see it. It's all your fault for going so fast. I couldn't keep up. Sorry about that, Mr. Davis. Would you still like it? Uh, sure he does. Gotta love that hazelnut, huh? Of course. I'm the manager. Is everything all right here? Yes, everything's fine. Nice parking job. I wasn't stealing anything. No, I'm sure it wasn't planned but once you got a look at the coffee in the bottom of the basket, I betcha the temptation was a little too much. Are you accusing me of being a thief? No, just human. Hey, Dad. Alex and I are going to be spreading some Christmas joy. Oh really? That's great. What are you two gonna do? We're going to be spending the next five days with Mr. Nilwater. You know, baking cookies, holiday decorating. We might even go to the homeless shelter and bring some good to others. Uh, I'm not so sure about this idea. It'll be fine, Mr. Fields. We'll check in every hour and you can come over with us on the initial visit. And Peyton and I will never leave each other's side. Can't you just start a recycling club or something? Dad! Fine. But I'm going, too. Yay! They're going up to Nilwater's place? Oh man, they're dead. I can't watch. Let's get out of here. You on a suicide mission? I kinda wanna watch. Come on, guys, let's get out of here. Come on, Daisy. Come on, guys, let's go. You ladies are sure about this? Yep. Oh for crying, what do you want? Uh, Mr. Nilwater, hello. The girls have decided they'd like to spend some time with you, baking cookies, decorating for the holidays. You know, bring some joy into your life. What? No! Go on, get outta here. Well, we could decide to come back every day and bother you plus get the neighborhood kids to be loud and play constantly on the sidewalk in front of your house. They could accidentally trample your grass, scuff your walkway. You're gonna help me by blackmailing me into going along with your plan? Nice start. Come in. Make yourself at home. We thought we would be spending the day baking cookies and getting to know you. We brought the ingredients for chocolate chip and peanut butter. Yeah. Does that mean we have to make both? Uh, no. I think one will be okay, right girls? Baby steps. Sure, okay. Aw, kitchen's right this way, come on. Don't make a mess. Which cookie sounds good, Mr. Nilwater? Oh well, whichever one you can make the fastest. Chocolate chip it is. How 'bout sitting on a stool over by the counter here? Sure. And where do you keep the bowls, Mr. Nilwater? First cupboard there next to the thing. It's better. Need a spoon? Yeah. Right there. Oh, good, thank you. Okay let's get started. ♪ It's the holiday season ♪ Time to join in prayer ♪ People running to and fro ♪ But do they really care ♪ They go through the motions ♪ They light up the tree ♪ But do they know ♪ What it means All done. We hope you enjoy your cookies, Mr. Nilwater. Yeah, so do I. I mean, I'm sure I will. Well, why wouldn't I? Try one, let's see what you think. Uh, I think Mr. Nilwater is ready for us to get out of his hair. Uh, yeah, let's, I'll try some later. Why don't you grab some and... Okay, thanks. There's plenty to go around, isn't there? Bye, Mr. Nilwater. See ya tomorrow. What? I hope we didn't impose too much on you. Uh, no, we're good. Thanks. I'm looking for the best grandmother in the world to come tuck me in. That's sweet. And might I add I think you are pretty special yourself. Nana, is it strange that I liked Mr. Nilwater? No. Honey, I think what you and Peyton are doing is very admirable. He lives alone, Nana. Kinda sad. Maybe he likes it that way. Really? I am so proud of you. And I know your parents would be, too. I miss them. Me, too. Now you go to sleep and dream about sugar plums and fairies. Okay, I'll do my best. Hey. I just wanted to say good night and that I enjoyed today. Are we doing the right thing? About trying to get puppies? Mr. Nilwater. Maybe he likes being alone and we're intruding. I look at yours and Alex's hearts. Yes, in a way you are using Mr. Nilwater in an attempt to get puppies, but hey, I know it'll make you happy to bring some joy to his life, too. You know you're right. When I was baking cookies I wasn't even thinking about the puppies. I just wanted to make a difference for Mr. Nilwater. You know it's not too late to start a recycling club. - Dad! - Okay. Fair enough. Good night, sweetheart. Sleep well. We'll get you all tucked in. Good night, Lucy. It's a reindeer by the way. Yeah, that's what I meant. I love you. Good night, love you. Sweet dreams. Oh no, they've seen me. Oh, goody, you're back. Good morning, Mr. Nilwater. Hi, Mr. Nilwater. Just out of curiosity, how long does this plan of yours last? Five days. Five days. How were the cookies, Mr. Nilwater? The what? The cookies we made. Oh, yeah, cookies. Uh, oh, hmm, edible. That's Nilwater-speak for excellent. Okay, well, let's get started, ladies. Any chance I could stop you? Nope. We'll put... Let's work on this here. I didn't tell you I was a Rastafarian, did I? Okay. Guess that didn't work. Mr. Nilwater, would you mind grabbing that ladder for me please? I got it. I got it. Don't break it. Just put it in the ground and just step on it. Dad, Alex and I forgot a few things. We're gonna run back to the garage. Okay. Thanks. Look both ways before crossing the street. Yes, Dad. What's up with those two? What do you mean? Well, I mean what are we going through this dog and pony show for? Ah, I think they believe that if they do a good deed that Santa will bring them puppies for Christmas. Oh, so there's an agenda. Yes. But they both have really good hearts, good intentions. They've been through a lot. I noticed you're not married. Oh, yeah, um, Peyton's mom, Sandra, lost her battle with cancer two years ago. Oh, I'm sorry for your loss. Thank you. It's been tough. For a long time I hated everything. Every morning. Each happy couple I saw, every night, just keep sitting there angry, wondering why it had to be Sandra. I mean aren't there plenty of criminals in the world this could happen to? Why someone good like Sandra? I wallowed for a long time. Then one day I looked at Peyton and I realized I have to let go. I can't show Peyton that being angry is okay. Excuse me, um, we're getting through though, one day at a time. Counseling has helped. The church and the support there. Alex has it much worse. Father was killed by a drunk driver. Year later she loses her mother to cancer. That's where they met. Their mothers were in the same treatment center. They've both experienced tremendous loss and yet somehow, somehow they're not angry at the world. Never thought to look here. I'm sorry, did you say something? I said, yeah, they have good hearts. Now, what do you say we get these lights up? Yes, let's do that. Okay. ♪ Oh Jesus, oh Jesus ♪ Oh what a wonderful child ♪ Jesus ♪ Oh my Jesus ♪ Soulful me ♪ These hands of mine ♪ Newly mine ♪ Oh me Hey, how you doing? Good, how 'bout you? Ah good, Merry Christmas. ♪ Let it be ♪ Glory, glory ♪ Glory ♪ To the new born king Welcome to the Sunday service. We're just a few days away from Christmas and I hope you've done all your shopping. One announcement, we are going to have a Christmas Eve candlelight service at seven. We won't have a service on Christmas Day so we can spend time with our families. Now last week we talked about the birth of Christ. Today I wanna talk about the Christmas spirit. Christmas has become commercial, big business. Having said this, the giving of gifts and family get-togethers have their place. And it's a wonderful way to give and receive love. Love, hmm? How does one achieve being a part of the Christmas spirit? Through love. Love one another seeking nothing in return. No one should be required to give gifts to earn someone's love. Whatever gifts you get this Christmas, be grateful and with a glad heart. Amen? Amen. Oh, thank you. What are you doing with your hands? Oh, oh... It was a wonderful service. Well, thank you. Merry Christmas and I just wanna say thank you for standing up for me the other day. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, right, sure. You're welcome, kid. And you're a good guy. Thank you, it's means a lot. That was a very interesting sermon. I wonder, do you believe what you said out there? Well, thank you and yes. I don't believe we've met. No, no, we haven't. I'm Nilwater. Well, where are you from? Me? Far away, far away. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas, sir. Nana, this is Mr. Nilwater. Hi, I'm Alex's grandmother, Ellen, and it's so nice to finally meet you. And you, thank you. I hope Alex isn't being too much. Alex, no, no she's a delight. We'll be over this afternoon to finish the Christmas lights, Mr. Nilwater. I'm sure you will. And try to come as soon as possible. I go to bed early. We sure will. Okay, great. Good. Well, it's so nice to meet you. And you. Thank you. Pastor. Mrs. Gregory. That sermon was absolutely wonderful. Well thank you and Merry Christmas, Mrs. Gregory. Merry Christmas to you. Curt, would you help Mrs. Gregory... - Oh yeah, of course. - Oh, Curt, thank you so much. Let's hit it. All right, I'm on it. Hey, will you look at that, huh? It's beautiful. Isn't it great, Mr. Nilwater? Oh they're not bad. Not bad. Okay, ladies, time for us to head home. Okay. Okay. Okay. Good night, Mr. Nilwater. Good night, good night, yeah. Good night. I'll take care of the stepladder in the morning, okay? Thank you, thank you very much. Not bad. Not bad at all. Okay, can I have everyone's attention, please? We are expecting some guests this morning and they are coming to help out. So please try and be patient with them as they are new. And let's try and welcome them to our home. Huh, yeah, we'll take care of 'em. You better believe it. Let's pray, shall we? Can't we eat first? No, we pray first. Yes, ma'am. Dear Lord, thank you for this shelter and bless this food, amen. Amen. Hey, I'm coming. What day is it today? Day three, it's day three. Okay, right, what are we doing? We're going to go pick up Alex and then we're gonna go to a homeless shelter. Homeless, oh we have one of those, huh? Yeah. Right, oh well let me ask you a question then. What are we going to a homeless shelter for when we can, I don't know, sew Christmas stockings? It's to make you feel warm and fuzzy helping others. And it's a school project that I have to do over winter break. Oh well, okay, all right. Oh that's horrible coffee. We can all go in my car, Mr. Nilwater. Don't worry, my dad is a great driver. And we have full coverage. Oh, no, no, that's not what I'm worried about. I'm trying to decide if I wanna be locked in the car with you Alex. Oh well. Excuse me. Hi, you must be the nice folks I spoke to on the phone. That's us I think. I'm Cara and thank you so much for coming in today. Oh, our pleasure, right girls? Absolutely. I'm John, this is Mr. Nilwater, Peyton, and Alex. They're the masterminds behind today. Very nice to meet you. Why don't I give you a quick tour then we can get to work. Great. Okay, this way. After you. How you doing, Mr. Nilwater? Oh, just fine, thank you. I'm doing a little bit of manual labor here thanks to you two. Isn't this great? We get to help out people and make your day a little better. Yeah. Thank you. You're welcome. Thank you. I didn't know what else to do. Hi, sweetheart. - Hi. - How you doing? Good. Good? You ladies did a wonderful job in the kitchen. And I was just thanking your dad here for moving all that stuff to storage. My pleasure. And you, Mr. Nilwater. Hmm? Thank your with all various chores. Oh, you're welcome. So when do we eat? Right now. Aye. We'll serve first, and then eat. Peyton, could you pass out the trays and silverware? Sure. Alex, I'm gonna ask that you give out the rolls. Okay. Just use these tongs. And, Mr. Nilwater. Hmm? Could you please serve the soup? I think I can handle that. Mr. Fields, can you help me give out drinks? Sure, and please call me John. All right, everyone, time for lunch. Lunch? Here and here. Thank you. You're welcome. Gonna have some soup? Would you like a roll? Oh, you're gonna be sorry. There you go. I stripped paint for that. Would you like a roll? Enjoy. Thank you. Here you are. - Care for a roll? - There you go, son. Here you go. Yep, and have a sip. Yes siree. Thank you. You're welcome. Can I get a couple of extra rolls for my dog Bandit here? Of course. Thank you. Ladies, this is Fred. - Hello. - Hi. Hello. So Bandit is a boy? No, Bandit's a lady. But she's got a knack for stealing snacks so I named her Bandit. Word of caution, don't leave any cookies unattended. She loves them. Does Bandit like soup? No, and none for me either. There's probably something back here we can find for Bandit. Did you hear that, Bandit? Bandit, can you thank this nice man? Yeah, well, extra loaf of bread. Very thoughtful. Very thoughtful. There you go. Thank you. All right. Thank you so much. See ya, Bandit. Atta girl. Dogs like breads. Okay, Bandit, you are the sweetest dog. You're just the dearest thing. I just love you. Fred, can we pet Bandit? Fred? Run for cover! Incoming! Hit the deck! Fred, Fred, it's Cara. Fred, it's Cara. You're here, you're here at the shelter. Fred, please. Try to help him. What? Where? You're safe. You're fine, Fred. Semper fi. Marine, too? I was in country. Your tattoo told me you were a marine. When you're in the company of a fellow marine, you're with a brother. Just sometimes my past comes back to pay me a visit. Bandit, Bandit, you Bandit, you come up here. Come up here, sweetheart. Yeah, you come here. Would you like to pet Bandit? Sure. She's gonna have puppies, you know. Really? What kind? We're not sure. All I know is she's been plumping up. Wow. Do you know when? I reckon pretty soon. Um, what'll you do with the puppies? Probably try to sell 'em. If not then just give 'em away. Why? How much? I'm not sure. You girls want one? Yes! Well, I'll see what I can do. It's open, come in. Hey, gang. - Hi. - Morning. Coffee's in the kitchen. Thank you. Watch this, Mr. Nilwater. - Yeah, that's uh. - How's it going? It's getting there. Yeah, yeah, it's getting there. Guess I just gotta keep at it. I guess you should. As long as you don't run off and join the circus. How could I do that when I've got you around, Dad? Mr. Nilwater? Yes. Do you have any photos of family or friends? Oh, family, no I'm sorry, I don't, no. Oh. So do you have any family nearby? Alex, maybe quiz Mr. Nilwater another time? Hey, listen, I'm afraid to ask but what's on the agenda today? We gonna be going in an airplane, dropping fake snowflakes over a school or a children's hospital or... Well, you're right about the location. We're going to the children's hospital to read Christmas stories to the kids. Santa Claus will be there. No kidding? Is this something you guys came up with or is it a school assignment? - Yes. - No. Mine. Peyton picked the shelter. I picked the children's hospital. We should get going. I'll drive. Yeah, all right, okay. Can I use the bathroom real quick before we go? Sure, yeah, it's upstairs, take a left. Okay, thank you. You gotta jiggle the handle. Daniel Nilwater. Look what we made you, Mr. Nilwater. Alex and I. Look at that. Isn't that cute. Don't... We will put it right on your pocket. Oh a little snowman. Looks like I'm the marshal of Snowland. You know if there were a marshal of Snowland. Well, then absolutely. This is what this badge would look like most likely I would think. But, uh, well, thank you for that. All right, shall we go? - Uh, yep. - Sure. Okay. All set. How are we this morning? It's time, sweetie. Gotta go to work. I understand. So today I brought you this one. I hope you haven't read it yet. Smells like hospital. Brings back memories of Mom. I don't wanna think about it. Hey, your mothers would be very proud of you girls. Oh, yes they are. I mean, I'm sure they would be. Hello. How can I help you? I called the other day, John Fields. Fields, I see you on the list. Great. Okay. See Olivia Roberts down the hall, room three. Thank you. Excuse me. Oh hi. Are you looking for the nurse's station? No, we're here to help today. John Fields. Olivia. Nice to meet you. As you can see things are a little nuts around here. Yeah, it looks like you've got your work cut out for you. Yeah, and for the other three personalities running around in my head. Okay now let's get you guys started. Today I'm gonna have you put on story time. So you'll read a book to one of the kids in their room for about an hour and then I'll give you your next assignment. Does that sound good? Sure. Sure. Nice to meet you. You too. Here's some of the stuff you need. One person can read while the other does the sound effects. So feel free to embellish where you like. The bells I think you can figure out on your own. And the cups are for reindeer hooves. - Okay. - The kids like it. Okay, where do we go? Room 204, her name's Jessica. All right, let's go, guys. Giddy-up, reindeers. Get on outta here. You must be Jessica. Hi, yes. Hi, I'm Peyton and this is Alex. We came to read to you. Okay to come in? Sure. My dad also came to help with a friend. I'm John and this is Mr. Nilwater. Hi. Hi. We brought some books. Do you wanna choose or do you want us to? You can. Okay. How 'bout this one? Um, okay, so Alex, you can read. Mr. Nilwater, you could do the man's voice and the Santa voice. I will do the bells and the reindeer hooves, and you can do noise effects like wind and stuff. Love to. But no laughing. It's my first time. Can I sit right here? It was three days before Christmas. There were three children, Max, Jamie, and Ben. One day, Mandy and Max were sitting outside and they heard this huge gust of wind. I said no laughing. All of sudden out of nowhere they see this huge sleigh with a bunch of reindeer. And they hear this huge voice say... Oh whatever happened to Rudolph? But wait, there was a solution. There was one reindeer there who was different than all the other ones. 'Cause it was finally time to shine. But thanks to Rudolph, Christmas was finally saved. The end. Bye. Oh, I'll leave these here. - Bye. - Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. It was good to meet you, Jessica. You, too. Do you believe in angels? Yes, I do. Now, why would you ask? I saw an angel in my dream last night. What do you think heaven is like? I think you're going to like it. Me, too. I'm tired. I think I need sleep now. I understand. I'm glad that I had a chance to meet you. Sleep tight. I will. Hello, my friend. How are you? Good, good, how are you? Oh, here's a prayer. Everybody needs a daily prayer, don't you think? Yeah, yes I do. ♪ Glory, glory hallelujah Lord, life is full of your wondrous mysteries. Thank you for all your mercies. Dad, Jessica's gonna be with Mom soon, isn't she? 'Fraid so, sweetheart. Hey, everything okay? Yeah. What's next? Thank you so much for helping out. So the staff now needs help setting up the cafeteria for St. Nick's arrival. I was thinking maybe y'all could help with that. Sure. Which way is it? To your left, down the hall. Let's go, girls. Thank you. Oh boy, this party's scheduled to start in 15 minutes. Yeah, these folks sure could use some help, huh? All right, we better get moving. You two so owe me. Yeah. Excuse me, we're here to help you set up. What would you like us to do? Great, we could use the help. I could use help setting up drinks. Two ladies could help Samantha set up photo stop. And Brie, as you can tell, needs help with that garland. Okay, I'll help with the garland. Mr. Nilwater can you take care of the drinks? 10-4. And ladies, why don't you head over to Samantha and kindly ask what you can do? Right. Okay, excellent, let's go. Okay. Hi, ladies. You here to help me out? - Absolutely. - Yep. Great.

Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, that's me. I really love to help. No, I mean it, you were good. Really? Well, you know, you got all those kids there, they're so innocent, and they, ah... Well, my mom says it's always good to try. Well, yeah, I suppose it is. Yeah, that's my mom. Tell your mom I say hello. I will. I don't get it. Get what? Why this? Why her? I honestly don't know. Why you? Sorry? Why are you here? I can size people up pretty quick and you're not the warm and fuzzy type. So why are you here? For two girls who have braved far more than they should have at their age. Two girls who've helped me see beyond what I saw in this world. Have a good day, Mr. Nilwater. Sure will. Hello, Daniel. Hello, Moira. What are doing? My job. Please don't tell me you're here to take her. She suffers. I know, but it'll destroy her father. In three days, she'll get her miracle. Her father will walk her down the aisle. Then why are you here? I'm here to watch over her. Good. Good. I liked Jessica. Me, too. I'm glad we went to a hospital. I just don't feel so angry anymore. Hmm, I never really thought about it like that. But you know what, you're right. All set? Yep, we're good to go. Did you miss me? - You betcha. - Hmm. There you are. Ah, thank you. So, something on your mind? I've been thinking about getting the girls something for Christmas, something nice. Maybe a good book for Alex and juggling lessons for Peyton and I just wanted to see your thoughts on it. Wow! I'm sorry, I didn't mean to say that out loud or at all, I mean, just wow, just yeah. You know what, I'm gonna stop now. You good? Yeah, I'm good. I just... I think that would be awesome. Thank you. I'll drive. Well, the girls are gonna love their gifts. Yep. Hey, thanks for stopping by the coffee shop. I think you're gonna love it. Sure thing. Good afternoon, how many? Hi, just two. Right this way please. Coffee? Yes, please. Thank you. I'll be right back with more cream. Yeah, thanks. Yeah, nice place, huh? Yeah, can't believe I've never been here. This is the best coffee I've ever. Wait a second. Cara. Look who's here. Come on. Hi, guys. Oh hi, would you like to join us? Come on in. Oh, thank you. Appreciate that. I'll help you. Thank you. That kind of a guy. How are you today? Um, good. It's a really good day. Hello. Hi there. Would you like some coffee? That would be fantastic. So, how are things at the shelter? Good. I'm getting paperwork and projects done finally. Oh, the girls keep asking about Fred and if Bandit's had her puppies yet. I think any day now. But I'll call you when she does. If that's okay. That would be great. Great, that'd be great, yeah, yeah, all right. Well, fun running into you. Yeah. Well, goodbye, gentlemen. Bye. Drive carefully. What? Nothing. No, I just thought it probably would've been a good idea if you asked her out to dinner or something. Oh, you were thinking that? I was thinking that, yeah. Just out of curiosity, did you set that up? Come on. You know how complicated that woulda been? I'd have to find out where the girls were to come over to your house and the phone calls. It woulda taken an awful lot. Yeah, it would have. Yeah. More like divine intervention. Divine, exactly. It's my house back there. I know. Oh, I get to walk from your house? You're gonna have dinner with us. Thanks. Dad, Alex and I are home. In here. Now, girls, that's not polite. Oh, it's funny is it? I'm sorry, Mr. Nilwater, but it is. It's incongruous. That's why it's so funny. Yeah, well who walks around with juggling balls in her apron, I'd like to know? I do because you gotta practice. It's more fun around boiling pots and stoves. Ah. Well, Mr. Nilwater is having dinner with us so please wash your hands and set the table, thank you. Uh, Dad, Alex and I are gonna go to my room for a few minutes. All right. They are really great girls, aren't they? Extraordinary. Does Peyton miss... Sandra? Yeah. It's not as bad as it used to be. I think yesterday helped. It was her first time to a hospital since her mom died. Well, you seem to be handling whatever gets thrown at you. Thanks. I am definitely not looking forward to the boy situation. What? I can imagine. It's just she's had to grow up too fast. I just hope I don't mess this up. Ah, I wouldn't worry about it. You're a good man, John. You're doing a great job. I don't know, I think with the Lord's help everything will just turn out fine. She needs a mother. Mr. Nilwater. Yes? Will you do the honor of saying grace for us please? I most certainly will. Lord, make us humble and truly grateful for this food and all the blessings you have given us. Amen. Amen. Who's hungry? I am. Me. Hope they're not being too tough on you. No, you scamps. Is now a good time? Sure. Okay. That's the last of it, Mr. Fields. Thank you, ladies. What's that, Mr. Nilwater? Peyton. What? It's just something I picked up for you ladies. I guess early Christmas gift. Oh yeah. Dad, can we open it now? Please, please, please, please? Yes, you can. Yay. Thank you, Mr. Nilwater. I'm off to join the circus. Ha, not so fast, young lady. Not until you're at least out of college. Thank you. It's amazing. Well, so are you. Would you sign my book for me, Mr. Nilwater? Absolutely, I'd be honored. Got a pen right here. Perfect. Thank you. There you go. Thank you. You're welcome. You're welcome. What'd you get? A copy of the first edition of The Odyssey. Your favorite! Yeah! I got juggling lessons. All right. You need it. Dad, can we schedule these tomorrow? Oh, I'm not sure what hours they're working on Christmas Eve but we can call. Yay! Well, it looks like I better be going. It's getting a little bit late and gotta hit the road. Sure. Hey, thanks for having dinner with us. Oh, you kidding? Thanks for having me. Thank you. Good night, Mr. Nilwater. Good night. Thanks again for the gift. Well, you're quite welcome. Tally ho. Good night. Look both ways before crossing. I'm telling you there's nothing. Okay, how did you find his first name? Maybe you got it wrong. No, I looked at his mail. It said Daniel Nilwater. I can't find a record of him anywhere. It's like he came out of nowhere and poofed onto the planet. Hmm. Maybe he's in the witness protection program. Really? What are the odds of that? Well. I don't know. But I do think it's kinda sad. I mean, no family. You don't know that for sure, Alex. Don't get too hung up on it. Maybe he's an angel sent from heaven. Oh, yeah, because an angel would be sent here to this place. Maybe he's here to help us get the puppies. Peyton! Okay, I'm just spitballing here. You're the genius of the two of us. You come up with the idea. Let me do some more research first. Alex, good morning. Everything okay? Hi, Mr. Nilwater. I apologize for coming so early. Where's John and Peyton? Um, they're coming later. I just wanted to drop this off. What's this? You didn't have to get me a gift. Just a little thing. Huh. Shall I open it now or wait till later? You can open it now. I think, well, I noticed you didn't have any photos with family or friends. Everyone should have at least one picture in their house. So I'm not sure if you have family. We thought we could be a good substitute until you get a picture with family or something. This isn't really coming out right. But here you go. Thank you. It's, oh, extraordinary. It's very sweet and kind of you. I'm gonna treasure this always. Well, uh, I gotta go. We'll be back later. Just a heads up, wear comfortable walking shoes. Oh, can't wait to see what this is gonna be. Walking shoes. Okay, so you found nothing? Nothing. No family history, no property records, no social media, nothing. Well, the social media thing, that's to be expected. Not sure Nilwater even owns a computer. Who owns the house? Some corporation, Clean Energy Company out of Houston. Weird. Yeah. So my witness protection theory could be right? Or it could be the other thing you said. You remember in the shelter when Fred flashed back to the war. Fred was in hysterics and it wasn't until Mr. Nilwater touched him that he snapped out of it. Could be a coincidence, good timing. Or, he really is an angel. What's your proof? I know you, Alex, you have to have something ready to go. Not a lot. Just that really in the whole no past issue. Like he was just sent down. To do what? He's been here for over a year now. Wouldn't he have done whatever it is already? I guess. Well. Good morning. Morning. Good morning, Mr. Nilwater. - Morning. - Morning, Mr. Nilwater. How's your day going? Well, so far. Right. I'm reluctant to ask but what are we doing today? We are gonna go get some presents for Fred and Bandit. Oh, how nice. I figured we'd pick up some food for both of them, a bed for Bandit, and maybe even some cookies. I can't wait to see if Bandit had her puppies. Me, too. Dad, we can get one, right? We'll see. Don't get too ahead of yourselves. Should we go? Sure, girls? Yep. - All right. - Okay. Boy the life of a dog, huh? Oh, John, so glad you're here. Everything okay? No. Fred cannot find Bandit. How long has she been gone? Since early this morning. Dad, we're gonna look for Bandit, right? Of, of course. Where's Fred right now? Out, he's looking for Bandit. Where does Fred usually look when he looks for Bandit? Could be anywhere between here and 6th Street. Okay, we'll go see if we can find Fred or Bandit. Fred is so distraught. I'm kinda losing my mind here. Hey, don't worry. We'll find them. Okay? Okay, thank you. All right, guys, let's go, come on, move. 6th Street, okay. Bandit! Bandit! Bandit! Bandit! Bandit! You okay? Well, I'm just a little surprised is all. About what? Never expected to be doing this today. That Cara gal, she really likes helping people, doesn't she? Yeah, she does. Bandit, please come out. Bandit! Bandit! Hey, hey, we're gonna find her, okay? I promise. You know, if I was a dog, what I would want more than anything would be a nice dumpster. Now, I happen to know that dumpsters are always behind buildings like this. Girls! Bandit, Bandit, Bandit. That's our dog! All right, now. - That's our dog. - Really? That's our dog. That's our dog. Well, you can pick her up at the county dog shelter. What, wait, wait, why not now? This dog's been running wild, no leash, no license. As far the county's concerned, this is a stray. I'm sure we can work something out, right? Look, go home. Your dog will be available in a few days. But she's about to have her puppies. They'll impound the puppies, too. What? Dad, can they do that? - All right, listen, buddy. - Please. Come on, it's Christmas, have a heart will ya? Look at these little kids. They're in tears. Sorry, I got a job to do. Bandit. Bye, Bandit. Hey, Merry Christmas. Yeah, Merry Christmas. Please tell me you found Bandit. Sort of. Bandit's alive. She's just been taken to an animal shelter. Dog catcher caught her just as we got to her. Okay, but she's all right, though? Yes. She hasn't had the puppies yet. So we should be able to go get her, correct? Actually, they need a day or two before they'll release her. Why? Think they need to process her. What if she has her puppies? Well, they'll impound the puppies, too. I'm gonna call the shelter right now and see what can be done. Did you find Bandit? Well, yeah, Fred. She's in the pound. She's great, she's fine. But they gotta go through some paperwork, take a couple of days and she hasn't had the puppies so don't worry. I'm gonna call the shelter. I might be able to apply some pressure. Why don't you all go home and get some rest. I'll update you with what I find. You sure you don't want us to stay? No, it's fine. I'll update you with what I find. Thank you. Okay. Well, I guess we go home. Hello. Uh, what can we help you with? Yeah, hey, um, listen, a friend's dog got picked up today and I thought I'd just swing by, pay the fine, and you know boop-diddy-bop, you know, take her home. Well, if the dog came in today, you wouldn't be able to pick her up till day after Christmas. But, kinda my point, you know, it's Christmas. And the dog's pregnant. I've got a couple of little friends that would really love a puppy for Christmas, if you know what I mean. Come on. ♪ We wish you a merry Christmas ♪ All right. I guess it is Christmas Eve. - All right, well thank you. - All right, follow me. Thank you, sir. You know, I'm breaking a lot of rules here, right? Well, thank you, sir, I appreciate it. Is this your dog? Ah, yeah, that's Bandit all right. Hey ya, buddy. Oh, what time do you close here? Uh, we close at midnight tonight 'cause of Christmas. Okay. Well, thank you. There you go. Look at that. Bandit, say Merry Christmas. Let's get outta here before this nice gentleman changes his mind. Ho, ho, ho, Merry Christmas. Now, don't try to tell me how to drive. Cara. Oh, hi, guys. I've been trying to reach you on your cell. Oh, I'm sorry, I left it in the office. We couldn't get the shelter to release Bandit today. What's going on? Mr. Nilwater called and asked us to meet him here. Why? Not sure. How's Fred holding up? He seems lost. Just sitting there mostly. Anybody need a dog? Bandit! She's okay! My Bandit. Did I ever miss you! Oh, thank you so much. We're just family right now. That's okay, Fred. You're very welcome. Did she have her puppies? Hmm, uh, no. It's okay. Yeah. Hey, who knows, maybe she'll have 'em tomorrow and they'll be Christmas puppies. All right, girls, we should let Fred and Bandit rest. You know, I'm feeling it myself. Peyton and I would like to invite you, Fred, and Bandit over for Christmas dinner tomorrow. Mr. Nilwater will be there, too. I will? Yes, yes you will. Well, that would be very nice. Thank you. Bandit and I will be there with bells on. Well, have a good night. Yeah, you too. Okay, let's go. Uh huh. Let's go. You got something to say? No. Good night. Drive carefully. Bye, Mr. Nilwater. Ho. Hmm. Mr. Nilwater must be going somewhere else. Yeah. Maybe he had something last minute to do. Nana? In the kitchen, Alex. Merry Christmas, sweetheart. Mmm. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas, Nana. Oh, Merry Christmas to you too, sweetie. Can we open presents? We sure can. How 'bout you open this one? Me first? Okay. Well, what's this? I don't know. Santa musta brought it.

I got a little something for you. Oh, thank you very much. And thank you for the puppy. Oh, I was afraid I was overstepping my bounds there but the girls wanted a puppy and well, I happened to be at the shelter and there you go. No problem. Peyton is ecstatic. - Mr. Nilwater. - Look honey. Girls. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. This is Maggie. And Murphy. - Murphy, Maggie. - Thank you so much. Oh, you're welcome, you're welcome. Merry Christmas, too. Merry Christmas. All four of you. Mr. Nilwater, you sit right there. - Okay. - And I'll get you some egg nog. Well, thank you. Nana, Merry Christmas.

You have a lovely home. Thank you. Well, let's eat. Shall we all gather our hands together and say a little prayer? Heavenly Father, thank you for bringing us together as family and friends. Thank you for this food, this blessing you've bestowed upon us. And thank you... ♪ 'Tis the time of year to see ♪ Decorations on trees ♪ Presents there for you and me ♪ ♪ It's Christmastime again Well, hello, Alex. Yes? On the present, the tag. You said thank you. What did you mean by that? You're going to have to go back, aren't you? Yep. Back up there. Yeah. But you know, I get to go back because of you and Peyton. You both restored my faith in humanity. Hey, once I'm up there I get to watch over the both of you, you know. At least that's what I'm gonna request. Hey, I've got something for you. Close your eyes. What was that? That was joy. Whenever your life seems a little bit crazy, I want you to sit still, close your eyes, and joy will come. Hey, would you do me a favor and explain it all to the rest of them? Thank you, Alex. Alex, come see what the puppies are doing. Ho oh. Well, I guess we'd better go out there and see what's up. I see you found what you needed. Yes, and I am humbled. Thank you. I would like to make one request if you will allow it. Ask. I would like to be charged with watching over children. I feel humanity can best be reached through them. So be it. The children need all the help they can get. Especially those two.
