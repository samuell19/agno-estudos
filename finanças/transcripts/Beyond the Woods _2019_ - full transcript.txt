Subtitles by explosiveskull I'm Detective Reeves. Today's date is December 2nd, 1993. This interview is being recorded and may be used as evidence. Please state your name. My name is Andrew Bennett. So Andrew, last time we talked, we discussed what you did to Laura. Now, we're going to talk about him. Can you tell me who this is, Andrew? Still working on this piece of junk, huh? Make yourself at home. I wasn't expecting anyone for a couple more days. Yeah, I just wanted to see how you were doing. Well, I've been better. And you? You seem a little lost. I thought she was getting better. I looked at you and I thought, "Wow." How can I ever thank you for what you've done for my family? What you did for Laura. You can't blame yourself, Jack. It doesn't make sense. What's with the boxes? You moving? No. Just packing a few things away. How are the funeral preparations going? Well, as good as planning a funeral can go, I guess. Sorry I haven't been around to help with any of it. Well... You're here now, ain't you? Jack? Jack? I need to know where Jack is. I'll tell you where he is. But you're going to listen to every word I have to say. Don't fuck with me, Andrew. I don't have time for this nonsense! I won't be home for dinner, you? I think it's fair you hear the whole story. You're overreacting... Yeah? I'm going to head to the store and grab a couple of things before it closes. Yeah, okay. Andrew? Is this your letter? Is this your handwriting? Come on, Andrew. I need for you to say it right into the tape. Yeah. I'm sorry, I can't hear you. Yeah. All right. That wasn't too hard, was it? Keep going. We... We used to dance to this song. Andrew... Remember when I said I didn't know how to thank you for what you did for Laura? She's always been afraid of heights. Since we were kids. There was this one time, a carnival came to town. We drove past it on the way home one night. I'd never seen anything like it and it didn't look real. We begged Mom and Dad to take us. Finally Mom did, and when we got there, Laura... Laura only wanted to do one thing. The ferris wheel. So, we got our tickets and waited in line. Laura could hardly stand still, she was so excited. So then it was our turn, and we got on the ride and everything was fine. But when we got to the top, Laura made the mistake of looking down. I've never seen anyone so terrified. Mom tried to calm her down... but she passed out. The ride operator even called an ambulance. That was how she reacted to heights. So her jumping like that didn't make sense. She was afraid of heights. Why would she go into the middle of nowhere and climb to the top of some goddamn waterfall and jump? You made it up. You made up a death where it would be impossible to find her body... Don't go accusing me of something you can't take back. I found her glasses in your fire pit. I tried to tell myself I was wrong. That I was overreacting like I usually do, but... I always looked to you as the person that saved my family. I never thought you'd be the one who destroyed it. Now you put that down before somebody gets hurt. Don't come any closer. You killed my fucking sister! That's enough! Now you listen to me and you listen to me good, boy. You're looking for answers right now and they ain't there. You want to believe she wouldn't kill herself? I do too. I do too! You know deep down your sister wasn't well. I stood by her, Jack. I took care of her, and I loved her. Where were you in all this? Yeah. You know, I think I liked you better when you were a drunk. We're a family, Jack. And we need to be a family right now more than ever. So you put that down. Put it down. I'm sorry. Hello? Help! Andrew. What are you doing, Andrew? Just wait a minute, okay? Wait for a second, just wait! If it means anything, it was an accident. Families have differences all the time. I guess the truth is, I didn't know what to do with him. I'll say. Hold that thought, I'll be right back. Alright man, let's get back to it. What the fuck is so funny? You won't find him. What? You won't find him. I know you went to go have a chat with your little buddies, but uh... Yeah, you're just wasting time. We got into an argument. Things got heated. I wanted to help her, but it was a real mess. I'm not a monster, Jack. This isn't happening. It's not real! Help! Alright. After you chained Jack to the tree, what was your plan? The woods can be a very scary place, detective. Hello? Somebody? You weren't supposed to be here. If you were here when you were supposed to be, this never would've happened. I need more. Please. I saw your pills. It's okay, Andrew. Whatever it is, we can still fix this. Help! Help, please! Somebody help me. Help! Help! Anybody! Help... Andrew. I won't say anything. No... Shit. I'm leaving you. What? Yeah, you heard me. I'm leaving you. So, where were we? I wish it didn't have to be this way. It doesn't. You're a good person, Jack. Just in the wrong place at the wrong time. Yeah, no shit. People are gonna start realizing I'm missing. Yeah, I know. This will be the first place they'll look for me. I told people I was staying with you for Laura's funeral. Don't be stupid. Now go. Go tinkle. I'll be back tomorrow. What's going on? Where am I? What the fuck are you smiling at? You bringing me here... you care. The Andrew I know is still in there. Tomorrow's the funeral. It's my sister's funeral. Andrew? Andrew! It's my sister's funeral, Andrew. Andrew... I heard them again last night. Heard who? The wolves. And out come the wolves, Jack. What do you mean, wolves? He started seeing things. Things that weren't really there. He told me he saw Laura. Jack. Jack. Wake up. Laura? Shhh, it's okay. Don't panic. I found your glasses. I saw your teeth. It's Andrew. He's lost his shit and he's gone crazy! You look so scared. Everything's going to be okay. What are you doing out here all by yourself? Because your psycho husband brought me out here when I found out what happened to you! No. No... I mean, why are you here, instead of at my funeral, Jack? Why aren't you at my funeral? I'm buried in the ground and you can't even show up? I'm sorry, Laura! I wish you could have been there. What did you tell everyone? Oh, sorry. Jack really wanted to make it for his sister's funeral, but I'm actually the one who killed Laura. And Jack found out, so I brought him into the middle of the woods and chained him up to a tree so he couldn't make it, but he sends his condolences! So tell me about your interactions with the family on the day of the funeral. Come on now Andrew, stay with me. Alright, this is important. And now to share a few loving memories of Laura, is her husband, Andrew Bennett. I ain't too much for speaking in crowds, so please bear with me. I was up last night, and uh... I was thinking of what I should say at a time like this. But uh... Well, luckily I was on my way over here today and I started thinking about Laura. And how if you really knew her, you just knew she had that way about her where... She could just walk into a room and... Just make it a little brighter. She had a kind word to say about most. And uh... If you ever... needed anything. you know she'd just... you know? I just kept thinking about her hands. How when she'd get excited, they'd do this little dance across her lap. Or... How when we first met... I don't know, it took me about a year to ask her out. But luckily I did and she said yes. I asked her to the movies and I found myself trembling outside this movie theater, and uh... I was terrified. Then all of a sudden this little hand just slides into mine. And... All those worries, all that fear... I remember looking at her that night and thinking that this is the woman I want to spend the rest of my life with. I guess we never really made it that far. But I love you. Thank you, father. Hello? Holy shit! What happened to you? Are you okay? You have to let me out of here, please! Of course, hold on. Shit! I'm going to need to go get help to cut the locks off these chains. Okay? Okay. I will be right back. Okay. Who are you talking to, Jack? You remind me of this pet I had when I was a kid. He was an ugly little thing. A guinea pig. Well like I said, I was a kid. And uh, one day I got this idea in my head. I wanted to teach him how to swim. So... I got this plastic bag and I put him in there and I tied the bag up real tight, and I tied this little piece of rope around the bag just to make it snug. And uh, I hauled off and... Threw that bag way out into the lake. I just stood on the shore watching the tide drag that bag further and further away. Remember I was real upset by this. I started to run along the shore. I started crying. I figured I'd lost him. I figured my folks were gonna tend my hide when I got home. But a little ways down this river bank... I look down and I see this plastic bag with something just trying to claw its way out. I run over, tear open the bag and sure as shit, it's my little buddy. He's looking up at me, soaking wet. Eyes are bulged right out of his head. And he's shocked. Right then and there... I promised I would always take care of him. And I'd never let anything happen to him. See I realized I loved the little guy. Well, next morning... I wake up all excited. I run downstairs to check on my pal and, uh... Just like that he was gone. Sometime in the night, alone. Maybe scared he left. You see Jack, I don't want you to leave. You're all I've got. You know the irony in all of this? I named the little fella Jack. Hungry? Andrew. Chief. Just want to offer you my condolences. And I'm wondering if I can speak to you for a moment. Maybe inside? It's a little warmer. So? I want to talk to you about your brother-in-law, Jack Rodgers. What about him? He's been reported missing. His mother filed a report yesterday and she was concerned about his welfare. We talked to a few of the relatives and friends and they all said that he was supposed to be staying here with you this week for the funeral. Yeah... He never showed up. You never thought to call your in-laws, see if Jack was there? Heck, you could've reported him missing yourself. I just didn't figure there anything to report. Jack was always the kind of guy to just get up and... I figured it was his way of dealing with things. We... didn't really talk much. I see. Well, do you have any idea where he might be? Other friends' places? Girlfriend? No. Right. How about having a look around the place while I'm here? Is that okay with you? You looking for something in particular? No, I just thought I'd take a little looksie because I'm here. If that's okay with you. Got a warrant? No, I don't. Do I need one? I think it's time to leave. Jack... Jack! Thought I lost you there for a second there, buddy. Wouldn't matter anyway. I'm going to die here. You don't know that yet. Whatever this is, we can work it out. I love you so much. But you need to get help, okay? And I'm not going to be here anymore. Andrew, you let go... Oh my god, Laura. Laura, sweetie. Laura wake up, come on! Laura, please wake up. Laura, please wake up. Wake up! Come on, wake up! No, no, no... Laura, please no! How you doing, Andrew? Can we continue? You seem quiet today, Jack. Here's your search warrant. Hey Chief! Found this. Citalopram. What is that? It's used to treat anxiety and depression. I think I got something! This matches the exact make and model of Jack Rodger's missing car. Well, you cracked the case. That is Jack's car. Mind telling me what it's doing in your possession? I'm a mechanic. Jack asked me to take a look at it. With everything happening, I haven't had time. Let's tow the car. Excuse me? I'm getting real tired of your little story and act here, Mr. Bennett. Things aren't adding up. You have no right to take anything. Shame on you. I got a warrant that says I do. We're towing that car. Why don't you take Sparky here and get the fuck off my property? You know what, Andrew? I think you know exactly where Jack Rodgers is. And I'm going to find him, and when I do, I'm putting the cuffs on you and you're going to jail. How about that? Tow the car! Go on, go inside. Cocksucker. What's the occasion? Listen buddy... I don't want you to make this harder on yourself than it has to be. Andrew, I won't say anything! I think we both know you're going to rat on me the first chance you get. Andrew, please. I'll... I'll give you a little time to get good with this. Andrew, no. Please, just talk to me Andrew! Andrew, wait. Just talk to me, please wait! Fuck! Jack, wake up! It's time to go, buddy. I'm not gonna tell you again, Jack. Everything's gonna be okay. There's no need to run. I love you... And I'll see you soon. Mr. Bennett, we're here to take you in for questioning in relation to... Gun! Put your weapon down! Put that goddamn gun down now! Bennett! Drop your weapon. Now put it on the ground. Do it now, Bennett. Back away - two steps! Keep him covered. Hands above your head! Andrew Bennett, I'm placing you under arrest. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say, can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to an attorney. Now, you have the right to have an attorney present during questioning. If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be appointed for you. Do you understand these rights? Come on, let's go. So you mean to tell me that you just walked right up to Jack and shot him? Twice? Well... Not every story has a happy ending, detective. You sat here all this time feeding me this bullshit story. When all I wanted to know was where Jack is. You wanna know where Jack is? Just check the fire pit in my back yard. So let me get this straight... You took your brother-in-law out in the middle of the woods, chained him to a tree and left him to die? I took him out there to explain things to him. That's a whole lot of work. Why all the trouble? Well, we're family. Families have differences all the time. I guess the truth is I didn't know what to do with him. I'll say. Hold that thought, I'll be right back. What's this, Andrew? It reads like you were trying to off yourself. You still not talking, huh? Well, let me tell you what I think. I think the day you went to kill Jack, you wrote a suicide letter. You weren't going to kill Jack... You were going to kill yourself. You just couldn't take the stress or guilt anymore. But you couldn't do it, could you? I reviewed the police report from your arrest that day. It says you were already armed when officers arrived. That you put the gun against your own head. Hold your fire! Put the weapon down. It's going to be okay. They ruined your plan, didn't they? But of course, you knew by that point it was all over. Keep him covered. Tell me where Jack is! Alright. You know, I sat here... and listened to every word you had to say. The way you wanted. But I'm tired of your stupid fucking games, Andrew Bennett. So I want you to get up on your feet. I said get on your feet! And you're going to help me find Jack, alright? Where's Jack? I said, where's Jack? Where is he? Where is he? Was it worth it? All the lies, the make believe. Man... Man, everybody makes bad decisions. We have to live with the consequences. I think that if Laura were here right now... I think she'd want you to tell her where her brother is. Tell me where Jack is. Huh? Here, write it down. All right people, listen up. We're looking for this man. His name is Jack Rodgers and he's somewhere out there, chained inside a shed. You've got whistles. If you see anything, no matter how small, go ahead. Make a sound and we'll converge on your location. Remember, he's been out here for days now. He's cold, hungry, possibly injured. It's my hope, no scratch that, it's my belief, that he's still alive. Alright, he's counting on us. Let's bring Jack home. Get those chains off him. Come on... Subtitles by explosiveskull
