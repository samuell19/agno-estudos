Now we know why guys join the air force. Maybe I should've learned a little Spanish before I came down here. They're telling us to come out and die like men. Something about our mothers and, uh... farm animals? They don't even know my mother. You go left, I go right. Ready? Ay! Ay! It's too early in the morning for this. I haven't even had my coffee yet. - Your guy as young as this one? - Younger! - They shot first. - Yeah. They weretrying to kill us. They were kids trying to kill us. They squeeze their trigger, you're still just as dead. Yeah. Now with her latest dispatch from the field, our reporter Lena Anemberg. John, We've seen it time and again around the world. Violence and destruction suddenly erupting in peaceful countries. Explosive conflicts over race and religion... have resurfaced and torn apart nations... that seemed to be on the verge of success. Here in the American South, the bad old days of bigotry and intolerance are mostly behind us. We've learned to live and work together. But now this peaceful corner of America... has been rocked by a mysterious campaign... of intimidation and destruction-- all of it aimed at minorities. These outrages have encouraged other bigots... to come out and try to spread their poison. Burned churches, ruined businesses and shattered lives... testify to these vicious attacks. Shockingly, not one of these crimes has been solved. Not one suspect has been identified. Meanwhile, people around here are scared. They wonder what target will be attacked next. As they sift through evidence, local authorities are at a loss to explain how these criminals... have managed to succeed so well... or where they might be hiding. AndI have to wonder... what evil forces have brought back the hatred and violence... that threaten us all. In Georgia, this is Lena Anemberg... on the road and on the radio for Trans-State Public News. Karl. Hello, General. How are you?I'm great. Thanks for coming.It was my pleasure, sir. Seems like just yesterday... that you and I were having our little run-in with Mr. Noriega. I'm sure the people of Panama are talking about us still. How 'bout a drink?I'd love one. Thanks. - Scotch, I believe. - You have a good memory. Well, you remember the things you want to remember. Good to see you, Karl. I head the board of trustees... for the Military Academy of the South. It's a private military school... up the road from here. My nephew, Ted, he's a cadet there. Second classman. - They asked him to join Werewolf Company this year. - What's that? Some small, elite unit. After a few months of drilling with them, studying with them, living with them, he cut me off completely. Won't take my calls. Returns my letters. Sounds like a normal American teenager. No, sir. Everything changed... once this new commandant, Brack, signed on. War hero. Huh. More decorations than a damn Christmas tree. He's turned the academy into some kind of a cult. You're moving awful slow this morning, Robson! You are not at an oasis, and you are not romancing some poor farmer's goat! Let's move! I said move! What is this? Mauk, did you sleep in that uniform? - Sir, no, sir! - I wanna see nothing elbows and assholes! You're moving like a girl, Cunningham! Harmon, take your P.M.S. out on someone else, will ya? You know, Karl, a history teacher left the academy for-- well, who knows what happened. Hard to get a straight answer out of anybody there anymore. I still do have something to say about what goes on there. If you're willing, I've arranged for you to take his place. - You'd be the substitute. - Undercover? As far as any of those people are concerned, you don't know me. You're the subordinate of a subordinate that I just happened to hear about. - I've already got some men in play. Some good men. - Then why me? Because they need a commanding officer. Of course, you know-- you know Baron von Richtoven. Yeah. World War I flying ace.Yeah. You may also know a rather curious fact in his biography. He began his military career in the cavalry. That's the code. That's how your men will identify themselves. "Richtoven began in the cavalry." I can't thank you enough, Karl. Present... arms! - Orders! - Orders! Hup! A cadet approached me last evening during study hours... wanting to leave the Academy. The problem was he felt he wasn't liked... by the other members of his unit. Dogs are liked. Small children are liked. Members of religious orders practicing charity and celibacy are liked. Soldiers... are respected. You are respected here. You are respected here more than you will be in any other place on God's Earth. More than in your own homes, your parents' homes. And it's not because you are good young soldiers. It's because you are great young soldiers. Left face! Column, left... march! ♪♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ Left! Left! Left, right! Hard left! Forward! Left! Left! Left, right! Left! Left! Left, right! Are you lost, or do you always have that look on your face? I'm lost andI always have this look on my face. Are you looking for something in particular? The commandant.Oh. Colonel Brack. I'm the new history teacher.I'm the medical officer, Dr. Chamberlain. Jennifer. My friends call me Jenny. Thomasson, Karl. But my friends call me Karl. The colonel's this way.Thank you. The barracks surveillance photos, sir. Mm. Yeah. I could get that autographed for you, sir. You think security is a joke, Buckner? No, sir. Won't be so funny... when the FBI comes rolling through the main gate in a Bradley fighting vehicle... headed straight for your barracks. - It'll be Waco all over again. - Yes, sir. So where are you coming to us from? From Argentina. Were you teaching there? I was on kind of a research grant. Do you have any experience in the military? A little.That's good, because the man you're replacing didn't. He found life at the Academy a little constricting. We do things by the book here. How long have you been here? About two years next year. So you do things by the book? Except when I don't. Well, here we are. Well, thanks very much for the help. I'm sure I'll see you around.I'm sure you will. It's that kind of place. The aerial maps you requested, sir. The bank and the power plant. That's very good, Buckner. Now... get me a cup of, uh, house blend. Buckner.Sir? Make sure she signs it legibly, will you? Go on, son. Colonel Brack? Karl Thomasson. Our new history man. Welcome to the Academy.Thank you, sir. Have a seat, please. You came very highly recommended by General Teague. Said you were a hell of a fine teacher and an even better soldier. - Would you like a cigar? - No. Thank you. Communists are good for something. Sir, I have a confession to make. I've never actually met General Teague. I was with the 7th in Haiti, Special Forces. My commanding officer recommended me to him. Haiti? Now, there's an exercise in minority management. Did you ever do the lambada... with those dark ladies down there? No, sir. There wasn't much time for dancing. What'd they have you doing? We went in early-- Special Ops. But, um, that's still classified. Well, it couldn't have been too special-- to drive those monkeys back into the Dominican Republic. I think you'll find the Academy is a positive place to work. The cadets are eager and disciplined, ready to follow orders. Come to think of it, so are the teachers. Well, then I'm sure I'll fit right in, sir. I'm sure you will. And if you don't, you won't last long. - That's a promise. - I'll remember that, sir. Teaching is a grave responsibility, Thomasson. We're shaping the future here. Godspeed to you.Thank you, sir. Cadets! Atten-hut! Cadets, face! You're in close proximity with your enemy, and your primary weapon is of no use to you. What do you do? What do you do? In hand-to-hand combat... we carry our arsenal of weapons... with us at alltimes, people. Make a hole. We carry them right here. Cadet Ward, front and center. In hand-to-hand combat, we have hand strikes, we have arm strikes, we have jump kicks, and... we have... take-downs. Recover! Return back to formation. But by far... your greatest weapon will be... turning your enemy's force against him. Turning your enemy's force to your advantage... can mean the difference between life and death! Yourlife, his death. Anyone... can learn to use an enemy's force... against him on the field of battle. - Excuse me, sir! - Me? Yes, you. Can I borrow you for a demonstration, please? Oh, I-I don't think that's a good idea. I was just, uh-- Closer, please.Well, uh, I didn't mean to interrupt. I was just walking by and-- No interruption at all, sir. Oh. You look familiar.Yeah, I get that a lot. Well-- what I'm doing, sir, is I'm teaching this outstanding group of young people... that anybody can learn the basics of hand-to-hand combat. Well, I don't know if anybodycan learn. Anybody, sir. There may be one person who can't-- me. You're not gonna hurt me.I'm worried that you're gonna hurt me. It's all right, sir. Do it, sir. All right. Quiet down, cadets! Well, when in Rome-- Buckner, take this man's wardrobe. Thank you. All right, sir. Very simple. I'm gonna plant myself here.All right. Come at me. Let's see what you've got.Uh-huh. What, do I just come at you? Just come at me. Throw a punch, whatever you think you might like to do. Sorry. Let's try that again. - You want me to try the same thing? - Same thing, sir. You sure I don't know you? I don't think so. Okay. Ready, sir? All right. You know, you remind me an awful lot... of someone that I was in Panama with. This crazy-ass captain who kept bitching and moaning about... collateral damage that we were inflicting. You know what? You remind me of this pain-in-the-ass sergeant... who was the light heavyweight champion of the 7th. Undefeated, untied and still pretty. That is debatable. Captain Thomasson, how are you, sir? It's good to see you, Devlin.You too, sir. Standby. Ward, take over class. Partner up, pair 'em off before you do those drills. Yes, sir! So what the hell are you doing here?I'm here to teach. Let me guess. Military History.You got it. Well, I betcha you might be familiar with this odd fact I learned the other day. Did you know that Baron von Richtoven began in the cavalry? Yes, as a matter of fact, I did.Thought you might. What else do you know? Patience, Grasshopper. Come on. Home, sweet home.Pretty big. Yeah, it was pretty big till they divided it into four apartments. Now it's pretty small. Door should be unlocked. Keys are inside. Furnishings are government issue. Any resemblance to a home is purely coincidental. My place is right across the street here. You got a cadre of people all around you, so watch your back, sir. I better get back to class.When can we talk? This place has eyes and ears, if you know what I mean. Tell you what. There's a, uh, little roadhouse about five miles south of here. We'll talk there. They water the beer, but the waitresses are full strength. Good to have you on board. I'm sorry. I thought I was supposed to be staying here. You are. You're gonna be late! Cadet Frey. Sir. Here, sir. - Cadet Harmon. - Sir. Here, sir. - Cadet Mauk. - Sir. Here, sir. - Cadet Robson. - Sir. Here, sir. - Cadet Teague. - Here, sir. My name is Mr. Thomasson-- Captain Thomasson-- and this is American Military History. If American Military History is not your final destination, please notify the flight attendant at this time and disembark. To be a good soldier, you must know the enemy. To know the enemy, you must know history. You must know how man reacts in battle. To win battles, you do not beat weapons. You beat the soul of the enemy. Who said that? Anybody? Come on. Take a chance. General George S. Patton. Someone who knew a little about soldiering. - Teague, right? - Sir? Are you any relation to General Bud Teague? Uncle, sir. Well, your uncle was one hell of a soldier. Don't you agree? People say that. People say he's quite a soldier. I'm asking you what you think.Sir, in this class, will we be discussing... the lies that have shaped American military policy? - What lies are those? - The Holocaust, for instance, sir. Cadet Buckner... what is it about the Holocaust you believe is a lie? What about it isn't a lie, sir? You got Jews and queers and Reds and Gypsies. You got all these degenerates that have pissed and moaned their way into history books. And they've all used the Holocaust to do it, sir. So you're saying that the Holocaust never happened? Six million people did not die, sir. - Hmm. - So the Nazi's never killed anyone? - Not 6 million people, sir. - How many? One million? - No more than 300,000. And that's a fact. All right. Let's say 300,000. No, no. Let's make it less. Let's say 100,000. 100,000 innocent people... killed, not for something they did, but for who they were. You wouldn't call that a Holocaust? No, sir. I wouldn't. And what would you call it, Buckner? I'd call that bad luck, sir. - Good afternoon. - Sir! Yes, sir! Well, I see you found your classroom without any problem. Yes. The cadets and I were just having a spirited discussion on modern European history-- fact or fiction? I like a spirited discussion. It broadens the mind, and isn't that what we're all here for? Intelligence? Yes, sir... when we can find it. ...combat, people! - Move, move, move! - Let's move! - You guys are Werewolves! That's right. Come on! Come on, Werewolves! Try moving, soldier! Work those legs! Go! Move it! Come on. Move like a Werewolf! Come on! That's it. Come on! Go, Werewolf! All right, Steve. Are you a soldier? Stay low! Come on! Kind of intense, aren't they? - Yeah. Who are they? - The Werewolf Company. Werewolf Company? The Academy's elite. Who are those other guys? Sergeants Van and Lim. Military advisors. They have their own military advisors? Perks of being in the elite. Lim, huh? Well, I better get going. I've got a meeting to make. You should stop by the infirmary sometime. Hospitalization? I like that. Let's see it, Buckner! You wanna lead? You call that leading? I said move! Throw that knife! So Brack's behind this? Mm-hmm. It's like this, sir: You got Werewolf Company. That's Brack's pet project, if you haven't already figured that out. They train by themselves, they eat by themselves, they study by themselves, and they have a tendency to disappear without a warning... for these little training missions. - Training for what? - Hi, guys. I'm Sissy. - Sissy. Hey, how are you? - So, you two aren't from the military academy are you? - Now, what gave us away? - You're the only two guys... in here without beer guts the size of beach balls. Let's see if we can't change that. Why don't you get us two icy cold drafts? Huh? Thank you. Mmm-mm-mm. Where do the Werewolves disappear to when they go on these training missions? That's Brack's deal, so it's hard to say unless we were to take a closer look. What about those older guys, the military advisors? Who are they? If I was a betting man, sir, my money would be on ex-convicts. And the Korean? Man, he is out there. His name is Lim. Military advisor with a rank of wacko first class. Well, Buckner seems to have a problem with anybody who doesn't look like him, and I assume that the rest of the Werewolves feel the same way. I see what you're saying. Why is an Asian a member of their band of merry men? Why indeed? You boys are in luck. Tonight is our country karaoke happy hour... and I think we're just about to get started. - Oh, boy. Thank you, Sissy. - Uh-huh. What about the cadets? A bunch of head cases-- all those little Werewolf bastards if you ask me. They even have their own private training compound. - Where? - About a 20-minute march south of the school. It's pretty secure too. They have Constantine wire, early-warning devices. They got the whole nine yards.Any way to get in there... without using the front door? That compound is like a pretty woman. There's always a way to infiltrate that perimeter... if you just look hard enough. Cheers. Hi, y'all. My name's Dixie, and before I take one more drink order, I just have one thing to say. ♪♪ ♪ Frankie and Johnny were lovers ♪ ♪ Oh, lordy, how they could love ♪ Sir, you know, I forgot something out in the truck.

An army that believes in what it fights for... is greater than its numbers. So never forget why we fight. Never forget that the atheists and the multiculturalists... will not rest until every white man, woman, and child is bent before them. Never forget that the next step after our enslavement... is our genocide. So our choice is clear. We fight or we die. Let's take a look around. What do you think? Well, The lock's not a problem, sir. Just gotta make sure the gate's not wired for any early-warning devices. Heads up. Bingo. I heard something.I'll take care of this. Hyah. Aah. Well, that couldn't have been pleasant. No, sir. He'll be out for quite some time. Call me later... just after rounds! Cadet Buckner. Don't tell me. The Nobel Committee has awarded you the peace prize. Cadet Teague is no longer registered for this course. Says who? Colonel Brack. You can sit. Have a seat, cadet. I'm hoping that wasn't meant as an insult, sir. No, Buckner. I was completely serious. I sincerely believe that you deserve the peace prize. You are a walking poster boy for tolerance and brotherhood. Because I am cadet commander, I deserve the respect accorded that rank, sir. Oh, shut up, Buckner, and sit down. That's an order. Hold on, Buckner. I'm just curious about something. - What if I did mean it as an insult? - Sir? What does a cadet commander do when his honor is insulted? He rectifies the situation, sir. Well, then rectify it. - That would be insubordination, sir. - Not if it's a direct order. Do it! Do it! Rectify it! Come on, Buckner! Kick his ass! - Show him, man. - Get him. Ohh! Thousands of people in this country died... fighting a war against assholes like you. Some of them were in my family. Sir, he can't breathe! Take your seat. Class has started. Cadet Teague is no longer in my class? He has to be transferred out. Why? He's a provisional Werewolf. Another couple of weeks, he'll be a full member. - I guess he's not taking any chances. - What kind of chances? He doesn't really know you. Fact is, none of us here really do. Do you believe in liberty, Karl? I guess the question is do you believe liberty has a price? You're a clever man, an academic. Name it. Eternal vigilance, Karl. That's the price we pay for our freedom, and it's a lesson we want all our cadets to learn. Unfortunately, it seems that the Werewolves are the only ones getting the message. Now, if there's nothing else, I have work to do. Captain.Oh, hi. I wanted to welcome you to the neighborhood. I live just over there. Oh. Thank you very much. I didn't think flowers and candy would do it for you. Well, you never know. I moved around a lot when I was a kid. My father was career army, so I lived in about 200 places. So I know what it's like being the new kid on the block. Well, it's a little different when you don't have a family. And you don't? No, I never got around to it. Neither did I.Well, you've got time. ♪ Live a life of blood and danger ♪ ♪ I wanna be a paramedic ♪ Pump that funky anesthetic ♪ Airborne, whoo, whoo So what branch were you in? Regular army. Infantry. After Panama, Just Cause, it seemed like a good idea not to re-up. - And you went right into teaching? - No. No. - I was a professional soldier. - A mercenary? I didn't take you for the type. - What's the type? - A person who goes into combat for any country that will pay. Well, I was a little more principled than that, I hope. Listen, I have things to do. Thanks for the present.Don't mention it. Wow. What did you say your name was again? Uh, Teague-- Ted. Well, Teague Ted, um... I'm working the next couple of nights, but, um, maybe I can see you on Sunday? Um, I'm not gonna be around this weekend. Where you going? Away. Away where? Just something for school. Going with other cadets? Look... it's not really something that I, uh-- Oh, shit! Is that the time? Lights out in five minutes.Time flies when you're having fun. How far away from the school are we? It doesn't matter. Just drive me. - I have to get dressed. - There's no time for that. I'm not getting behind the wheel of my car stark naked. Bye. I'd like to see Colonel Brack. Why? What's the problem, handyman Luther, you got a short circuit... or you got a leaky faucet? I need to see him, cadet. It's cadet commander. I need to see him! Yeah? Well, he's busy. I was in the military, kid. Don't forget it. Yeah? What branch was that, Salvation Army? Violation of curfew is not something we take lightly. I believe I have an explanation, sir.Save it. You're restricted to quarters for 72 hours. - What about this weekend, sir? - You won't be going. Sir, if I may? Sir, I don't need to remind you... that Cadet Teague is very close to moving beyond his provisional status. And I think it would be unfortunate if that were to be jeopardized... because of this one... lapse in judgment... sir. Who will see that there are no more... lapses in judgment? I will, sir. Just remember, Teague, two more weeks and you'll be a full member. - It's yours to lose. - Sir. Yes, sir. - Cadet Robson. - Sir. Here, sir. And Cadet Mauk.Sir. Here, sir. Well, the Werewolf Company seems not to be with us today. - What a surprise. - Do these guys miss class often? - They're leaving on a training mission. - What kind of mission? They don't say.And we don't ask them. I'm sorry about how late things got the other night. I mean, I just kinda lost track of the time. You're not mad at me, are you? Well, you did what you were supposed to do-- questioned Teague. He did what he was supposed to do. Volunteer nothing. I know, but I got him in trouble. I didn't mean to. Come here. Mmm. You smell like a spring day. You wouldn't mind if I saw him again, would you? Teague? Well, he's a little young for you, isn't he? Yeah, but he's nice, though, and it gets really lonely working out at that bar. And the only person I see when I'm not working is you. You didn't sleep with him, did you? That's not what this is about, is it? I'm thinking about moving back in with Mom. - Your mother is a multiculturalist. - She's engaged to a black man. I will not have my only daughter in that kind of rancid environment-- polluting your morals-- and I will do everything in my power... to make sure you are not, you understand me? I think all this spying that you're making me do has polluted me enough already. That woman is a Godless multiculturalist. So if we use Vietnam as a model-- Let's talk about the Civil War. I think it's important for all of us to understand... the role that black soldiers played in the Union victory. They served in segregated, all-black units, and they participated in almost 500 engagements. Twenty-three black soldiers received the Congressional Medal of Honor for Bravery. And as you know, that is the military's highest honor. And you know... some say, sir, that we're primed for another Civil War. This time, whites against blacks. I don't know if you're aware of this Buckner, but they actually have medication for people with your condition. ♪ I wanna be a' airborne ranger ♪ ♪ Livin' a life of blood and danger ♪ ♪ I wanna be a' airborne ranger ♪ ♪ Livin' a life of blood and danger ♪ ♪ Airborne ranger Airborne ranger ♪ Yeah! Just a minute! Hi.Hi. I was a little short with you the other day. Ah, I didn't even notice. Well, I thought I'd make it up to you and buy you a drink. All right. So the military has always been a part of my life. Not only was I an army brat, but I went to a military college, and the army paid for my medical school. So I guess that's why I take the whole mercenary thing so personally. Because you think guys like me are in it just for the money? Yeah, I guess. I never went into combat for just a paycheck. There's too much at stake. But, in the end, I think that was the reason I quit. Got to the point where I was just in it for the money. Do you ever think about going back? No. Makes you stronger, growing up the way I did-- that kind of rootlessness. Makes you depend upon yourself. Although, it gets a little lonely sometimes too. Makes you do things... you don't always wanna do. - Do you ever do things you don't wanna do? - No. I used to... but that was my job. Let's get outta here. Hope you like this wine. If you don't, it's your fault, 'cause you bought it. Cheers. Red wine always raises my temperature a little bit.Really? It always makes me... just a little bit tired. Are you tired now? Actually, no. I'm feeling wide awake now. Hello? Okay. Where? No, but I'll find it. I have to go. Sorry. Teague here.Sir, it's Karl Thomasson. I'm just wondering how far away you are.How far away am I from what? From where I am.Karl, what are you talking about? Sergeant Van, I have sighted the enemy. I'm gonna have to call you back. Whoo! Go, go, go! This will be interesting. Forward. I think this... and this. Van, let's go.Buckner! You pussy! I always expected Van wouldn't come back one day. He was the dumbest white man I know. And Thomasson-- when can I get rid of him? Not until I find out who's gonna come looking for the body, so why don't you take the rest of the day off, have a couple bottles of sake? Sake is Japanese. I'm Korean, Colonel. Mm-hmm. And don't think you wouldn't be back there right now... if you weren't a world-class exterminator. Dismissed. - Jenny. Hi. - Hi. - I owe you an apology. - For last night? - Yeah. - That's not the first time somebody walked out on me, although, I have to say it's usually afterwe've had sex. I'm sorry. I'd like to make it up to you. How about dinner? I can't. Well... no second chances, huh? No. It's actually nothing like that at all. I substitute in an emergency room in Atlanta. - How about next Saturday? - Oh, I'd love to. It's the officers' ball. The social event of the season. Everybody will be there. - What, you don't dance? - I wouldn't call it that, no. Well, it's not about dancing. It's about being part of the group. Esprit de corps. - I think we should go. - I think we should. So I'm drinking a beer, surfin' the net, decide to check these guys out. I'm doing a little research, try to figure out... where these little Werewolf bastards were over the weekend. I didlearn something in the military besides how to kill people and blow shit up. And look what I found. "Atlanta bank bombed." Mm-hmm. But not just any bank. That's the Development Bank of the South-- the biggest backer of minority-owned businesses in the southeast. "Witnesses reported seeing a group of four teenagers dressed in military fatigues... fleeing just before the blast." Sound like anybody we know? So I start digging deeper, and look what I find. What is that? Oh, I'd say that's your average, run-of-the-mill white supremacist hate site-- with one little difference. See all these letters in here? These are all signed "The Colonel." - Brack? - I don't think it's the chicken guy, sir. "We must defeat our enemies absolutely, "we must use violence generously, and we must begin immediately." Ted. Ted! Hey, Ted! What do you want? I wanna help you. Help me do what? I don't think you know what you're getting yourself into. Either you step aside right now, or the next person I speak to is Colonel Brack. Call me if you feel like you're in trouble. Captain Thomasson.Hello, Harmon. Can I help you with something, sir? No, thanks. I'm waiting for someone. She's working late. Well, have fun.Yes, sir. I hope I didn't keep you waiting.Hi. Do I look okay? You look phenomenally okay. My compliments on your taste. Why, thank you. I picked him out myself. Enjoy the ball. You lead with your left.I'll keep that in mind. Ladies and gentlemen, may I introduce our alumnus, Lieutenant Colonel and Mrs. Callahan, class of '81. - Something wrong? - No, no. - Uh, Cadet Mauk. - Yes, sir. I'm wondering if you wouldn't see Dr. Chamberlain to the bar. She needs a drink. - Don't you? - I do now. Where are you going? Just around the corner. - Which corner? - Ma'am. Come on. Let's go. I thought I'd find you here, sir. What's going on? Got a road trip. Here, take a look. - What do you think?-I think there's room for me in the back of that supply truck. Stand by, sir, you're not going anywhere without me. If I don't come back, I need somebody to come get me. Hmm. All right. Come on. Let's go. Move. Let's go. Let's go. A billion dollars doesn't buy what it used to. Come on, come on, come on. All right. All right. - We've got exactly 12 minutes. - Let's split up. Do what we came here to do. Meet back at second level. Go! Seventeen stories down, to the gates of hell and back, boys. Whoo! Shit. Frey! Ted, I can make it. I can make it. - Go with the others. - Ted. - We've gotta help him! - Go with others. It's gonna blow up. I can make it. Help me. Help me. Where's Frey? He fell. Come on, let's go! Acceptable loss. Go! What about Frey? Come on, go. Move out. Move. Go, go. Come on. Let's go. You like it? You like it? Another one? Another one? Come on. You like it? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Ow, ow. Come on. Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Come on. Come on, baby. Do it to me. They sure know how to rig their demo. I'd say we have enough to call in for our backup, sir. Call? Who you gonna call? You think Brack is in this for himself? You don't think there are people, powerful people financing this operation? Every time I see y'all, y'all are whispering to each other, just like a couple of old ladies. It's a wonder you survived in 'Nam. Oh, y'all think I'm a little nuts, huh? Think I don't know nothing. That's okay, everybody does. I tell you one thing I do know. Richtoven began in the cavalry. - Teague sent you? - Teague sent me here first. I'm his eyes and ears, his antenna, his feelers. Even if you get past the people that Brack is in bed with, you ain't got nothing on him.For starters, Bubba, how about a couple major bombings? You can't connect him to either one. You want Lim? Want to cuff the Werewolves? Go for it. You might get lucky. But if you want Brack, you're gonna have to sweat for it. I got something to show you. Now, Ms. Frey, you must know that we're doing everything humanly possible. The sheriff's been notified, It's just a matter of time before he turns up. Yes, ma'am, I will. Our prayers are with you. - What is it? - Frey was alive when we left. - Barely. - He was hurt, but he was alive. Sergeant Lim made a necessary but difficult decision. Frey wasn't gonna make it. To take him would've jeopardized the mission and everyone on it. We could've saved him if we'd brought him with us. Casualties, Ted. They are an unfortunate fact of combat. I know that you're upset, but I'm satisfied the right decision was made. Now, I'm sure you have other things you should be doing, son. I don't believe in what you believe in. I don't hate the people you hate. Uh-huh. You know, when I was your age, I was in a school very much like this one, in a unit not unlike the Werewolves. This was during the Vietnam War. So much of our effort was aimed at disrupting the protests. It seemed to me, because I was young, things were getting too rough. We were getting a little too rough. I wanted out. Do you know what my commander's response was, hmm? Now, I know somebody like you doesn't need this kind of persuasion. Just remember what I said when you first became interested in the Werewolves. Once you're in, you're never out. Do I make myself clear? ♪ I wanna be an airborne ranger ♪ ♪ I wanna live a life of danger ♪♪ Is this what I think it is? The guy you replaced is under all that stuff. How did he die? He was so careless, even I couldn't help him. Teague sent him in? Nope. He was just naturally nosy. So who killed him? Lim? I could tell by the way his neck was broken. You see him do it? After they buried him, I dug him up. - I put him back. - Luther, did it ever occur to you to call the police? I've got something else to show you. 101st airborne. That's where I met Teague. I was in demolitions. E.O.D.-- Explosives Ordinance Disposal. The way I see it, you can either out manoeuvre Brack, or outgun him. Either way, you got to know exactly what you're doing. Coffee? It's tight, I like it. Consider it approved. - Frey's dead, isn't he? - Red. Didn't you say it wasn't necessary for you to go? So it's my fault that you left him there to die? Isn't it true in your culture that a woman is expected to open her mouth... only for her man's sexual gratification? I may have you people all wrong. Hold up, sir. They're gone, all the Werewolves. I just saw them at the compound about ten minutes ago. How are we gonna find them? It's a basic G.P.S. navigational system with one important difference. Instead of telling you where you are, it tells you where the other guy is. How does it know where the other guy is? Well, it helps if you put a little homing device under his bumper. - You're not coming with us? - I never travel. What do you mean, you never travel? I mean I never travel. Anywhere? Are you aware of what goes on in the world? Hmm? There's some crazy shit out there, man! How did you get to the academy in the first place? Carefully. Very carefully. I got work to do anyway. Brack went with them. He never goes with them. They're splitting up. We've got the Ford on display. We should go after Brack. I'm gonna take a look around.Yes, sir. I'm gonna keep an eye on Lim. It's time, son. Adversity introduces a man to himself. Werewolves now, Werewolves forever. There is no pain. Let it bubble up, boy. Damn. Join us when you compose yourself. Hey. Lim's headed to Teague's house. How long is it gonna take us to get there? Forty-five minutes if we fly. I need you to radio the academy. I want the campus locked down until we get back. I'd like a piece of him, sir. You'll all have your chance. Where are you going, you son of a gun? Goddamn. That Lim is one sick mother. Brack's tying up loose ends. Yeah. The display in the jeep says that Lim's headed back towards the academy. We should head back. Well? General Teague is dead, Luther. - Then we should do something about it, shouldn't we? - Yep, it's time for payback. - We're all gonna split up. - Give ourselves three times the chance of finding him. Whoever finds him first-- My pleasure.That goes without saying. Hey, Lim. I want to talk to you, you sick bastard. You lose, sir. Watch it, Luther. I'm gonna take away your drool cup. Go. Move. You know what I think, Luther? I think the only solution for a mental degenerate like yourself... is a mercy killing. As one degenerate motherfucker to another, I think you should go first. You know why I was discharged from the army? Huh? I enjoyed killing too much. Didn't you get the message? The camp is under siege. There are two guys, Harmon-- a history teacher and a martial arts instructor. That's not under siege. That's a faculty meeting. Get to your post and that's an order! You know, Harmon. There's something I always felt you should know. - Cat fight. It's cool. - Come on, Mauk! I wish I could tell you things aren't the way they look. But, like I said, loneliness makes you do things you don't want to do sometimes. Pretty poor excuse. Yeah, I'm running out of good ones. - So I was just another subject of surveillance? - That's the way it started. Toss the gun, bright boy. Just what I like to see, the staff networking. There can be injuries in what the Werewolves do. It's nice to have a doctor on your side. At least I think she's on my side. Sell your multiculturalism in hell. No! Oh, baby. Brack. Brack. In Chinese, the word "crisis" consists of two characters-- The first is danger, the second is opportunity. Your uncle's dead. Brack's responsible. Don't listen to him, Teague. - Lim killed him. -Thomasson's the one who did it. The man's a mercenary, totally without moral fiber. How did he die? The same way Lim kills everyone-- with no mercy. You don't really believe him, do you, son? You're not being a great, young soldier. Take Teague's weapon. That's an order! Now! Five of you and one of me. You're outnumbered. All of this will be on your academy records. Someone else is gonna decide this one. And what do you mean by that, teacher's pet? It means we're gonna call in somebody with a badge. You, you're the one who turned my troops against me. - Hyah! - Halt! Halt, Colonel Brack. For what, Teague? If you shoot me in cold blood, oh, you uncle would be so proud. You're not even being good, young soldiers. You're being treacherous little shits! The future belongs to real white men. It's just the holocaust. Get over it! Racial purity! He was very proud of you. I tried to get out after Frey died, when I realized it wasn't some war game we were playing. Brack made us feel like men, soldiers. I guess Buckner was the only one who really stopped to think... what it was we were soldiering for. You know, just because you made one mistake... doesn't mean you shouldn't keep fighting. As long as you remember that the good fights, the important fights, are rarely fought on the battlefield. You look pretty good.I feel like shit. Doc says he'll be up and around in no time. Well, whoopty-fuckin'-do. What the hell does he know? He ain't the one who had his insides all slashed and diced. Just when I start to feel better, Luther tells me you're gonna be around a while. Yeah, the trustees have asked me to stay on and help till they find a new commandant. Besides, somebody's gotta take care of you. I thought you people wanted me to recover. How in the hell am I supposed to recover when I gotta keep your butt out of trouble, sir? Captain, I ain't done complaining yet. Captain. Captain, get your sorry ass back here, sir. Luther, let's go get a beer. Cool.
