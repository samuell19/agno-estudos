Benevolently transcribed by -= AnnotatedSnark and LiHi =- MIND THE GAP... He's coming... Welcome back! Yes, it's finally here, solar-eclipse day! And here's that radio phone-quiz in full: "The eclipse:..." ...is caused by a) an asteroid, b) Jupiter, or c) the Moon? Calls cost 50p a minute, so keep those calls coming! Funny place to pick up a cab, innit? The M25? Where've you come from? The sewer. The sewer. Thought you came out of the service station... Funny place to pick up a cab, innit? The M25? I don't know. Is it? You tell me. Might get run over. - What? - Said you might get run over. Ah. No, I don't think that is probable. Yeah! It's one of the busiest roads in Europe, mate! Oh... how fascinating. Yeah... Some people call this the Neverending Road. It's like a doughnut. Goes round and round... Goes nowhere forever?... Not from around here, are you? You can't smoke that in here, it's a non-smoking cab! Have no worry. - It's not real cigarettes. - Fuckin'... What line of work you in, then? I cut people open to find out where their dreams live. - Come again?? - You, for instance, have a reoccurring dream... You are in a pub. Pint, please, mate. You receive a draught of beer with great pleasure. You drink with relief... ...and then you turn and look. And you recognize with terror that The Happy Eater has just come from your home Where it has been devouring your children! Its redness... ...is the blood of your sons. And the dreams started after your operation. They placed an alien organ in your body. A pig's heart transplant. And with the pig's heart came piggish thoughts! Well, that's where you're wrong, mate! Wasn't a pig's heart, it was a baboon's! - "Baboons"? Yeah, baboon! - Baboon? - A baboon! Ah, a baboon! Not a pig, but a baboon. Where do these thoughts come from? Through ear? Are you ill?? Donno... I don't know where the thoughts come from. Everything's been getting strange... Stranger. The traffic patterns are changin'... The roads are suddenly empty and then full. People in this cab are getting stranger and stranger... My inner-Baboon is taking over... God help me. Pull over! - Pull over! - What, here? ...THE YES SURPLUS IS TO BE NEGATED. This morning's reports, sir. In general the situation is... worrying. - Our beat officers have been sending in strange report. - Why? What have they seen? It's not so much what they've seen as what they're saying, sir. Like? Officer 26 15 5 reports: "a higher incidence of language" in Potter's bar. Officer Komsruck report a "window conspiracy" in Hoxton. A window conspiracy? A window conspiracy. STOP FOLLOWING ME... - STOP LOOKING AT ME - SPY ON SOMEONE ELSE - DON'T LOOK AT ME! - WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS STARING?... - LOOK OVER HERE... - TODAY, WE BREAK FREE OF OUR FRAMES - HE IS HERE - I'M WATCHING YOU - I'M LOOKING AT YOU... - YOUR DOUBLE GLAZING DOES NOT IMPRESS ME! - HE'S HERE!... Taxi! Who're you, then, mate? Sunshine! Who are ya? What line you in, then? Oh! Aren't you that really brilliant junior minister for fish? Fisheries, yes. Rory Spottiswoode. Rory Spottiswoode... I say, yeah... - What's that you got there? - It's my work... - Give us a gander! - I'm afraid it's confidential. Hey, I voted for you! I've got an awful lot to do! I really got to get going! - Hey! See up there? Behind my head? - Yeah? There's a sign. What does it say? - "This is a non-working cab". - And what does that mean? Your cab doesn't work? No, don't be a plonker, the cab is working fine! - Put your work away! - Can't I just look at my papers? I'm afraid that if you just want to look at your papers you're gonna have to step out of the cab. I am a government minister! I don't care if you're the Queen of Sheba! No exceptions! You talk with me! I've no wish to talk with you! That's of no consequence! You talk; I don't listen... I talk; you don't listen. Have you never been in a fuckin' cab before?... I'm lonely. I'm bored. The only human contact I get is through this fuckin' mirror. I need some human contact! I'm the Minister of Fisheries, and I've been having extensive talks with representatives of Gwupigrubynudnylandia. It's been hard work. I've hardly seen my pets in the last fortnight. It's hot... It's hot in your cab. I have such great ideas, Roy. I can make a hundred knife-edged decisions every day! I shouldn't be in Fisheries... Two weeks! Two miserable weeks sitting at tables with carafes of water! I hate water! Those bloody Gwupigrubynudnylandians! They've disrupted my routine with their stupid negotiations! And have you seen their suits?! What am I saying? Where are we? Who are you?... Who are you? Where's mister Spottiswoode? This way, minister... - Scotland Yard! - Ok, gov'ner... Scotland Yard. Yeah... Yeah, gov'ner. Wait! - Don't I know you from somewhere? - Who, me? No. Not unless you... got in my... cab before. Something familiar. Something strage. Wait! No! I'll get out here, whoever you are! Whoever you are. I'm Roy. Roy from Walthamstow. ...over to the embassy, where a breakthrough agreement's been brokered by the Fishing Minister, mr. Spottiswoode. In view of the grass-skirt behaviour during negotiations, and the continued face-painted mud-slinging between our two nations, I have decided to come down fully in favour, and the decision, let me tell you, has not been an easy one, ...of declaring all out war on Gwupigrubynudnyland and on the Middle-Far-Distant East in general! Let me make it quite clear: this is not a limp-wrist, blue-hat war, but the real testosterone! But we have been supplying arms to Gwupigrubynudnyland for 20 years! And now you're saying we'll use them on our own troops? Yes. Let's face it, we've trained these bigots! Causing havoc! Raping Au Pairs, and things like Aldershot. I think it's about time we pack them off somewhere foreign! Such as Gwupigrubynudnyland! Let them run amok there! I mean 4th Para are going to suffer! I'll tell you that, 'cause they were personally responsible for sodomizing my aunt Julie, and I've not forgiven them for that, the bastards! They're going to be in the thick of the action from the word GO! 4th Para are going to die! And I'd like to make this quite clear to you all: that's me, Rory Spottiswoode, the Minister of Fisheries, NOT the Minister of Defence, who has declared war. Hope you appreciate that! Who will be in charge of the campaign? Captain Bird's Eye will be coming out of retiremet to take charge of the Navy. Say, can I get a close-up? I'd like to get this across to the voting public: Captain Bird's Eye's products are extremely healthy and nutritious. And if you've not had an Alcopop today, your day has not truly begun. Have an Alcopop for breakfast. For the wee ones. Little Jimmy. Give him an Alcopop to start his little day! Alcopops are going to form the backbone of our war effort. We will not go into war sad. We will not go into war sober. We will go into war with a smile on our faces! Bloated and exalted with Alcopops! Mr. Spottiswoode speaking from the embassy. We will come back when we have more information. Total chaos on the roads today when as many as 6000 Black Cab drivers... were summoned to the same Kosher meat packaging plant in north London... by a strange voice, which they described as "angelic". Here, in the Underground control room, I see myself as Emperor of London. And I dream of the day when London will cover the entire world surface... And the United States of America will be London's 57th postal district. And the Central Line will run from Alaska to Vladivostok... And I will control all of it, from this control room... But, for the moment... the lack of investment is really getting me down... Mr. Schlauch! You were saying? Yes, Lindsey. Read me the last sentence. Our client profile is very disencouraging. Our last customer survey said that only people with very low self esteem - ...travel on the Tube network. - Yes, Lindsey. The problem with the Underground System ...is that no one in their right minds... would choose to travel... underground. "Yours sincerely"... et cetera. I'm going to buy some fags. This is London Underground Control: We've popped out for a few minutes to buy some fags. London Underground apologize for any inconvenience. - Emperor Schlauch? - Yes? I have something for you. A mango. And... a telephone directory. The Book of the Names of the Dead. And the Orb of Judgement... So, this is a first rate opportunity this lifetime for those in the south east to witness a full solar eclipse. Unfortunately, in the late afternoon... ...said effect won't be-- The radio is dangerous from now on. Our struggle is over. Our imprisonment in this tower... ...is at its end. You both know secretly we have been preparing for this. I have met with the ????? and have shed my earthly form. Today, you unleash the forces in the Underground System. London Underground would like to advise customers of a situation: From now on, the entire earthly... ...Underground network will be shut down. London Underground apologize... for any inconvenience... ...this may cause. This... is... due... to... It's the Tubes now, sir! And no one can tell me what's happened. - Send someone down there. - Well, that's just it, sir. Sounds stupid, I know, but... no one seems to be able to find a Tube station. The situation in general, sir, is worrying. I have a conjecture, Cuthbert. That it has something to do with that taxi driver... In his cab I sensed the presence of a strange force. A force the like of which I have not felt... before. Cuthbert, today is a strange day. The day of a solar eclipse. The planets are all out of alignment, and all is in flux. There may well be today some psychic disturbance. And yet I am concerned, Cuthbert. The Pale Child of the Astral Plane that represents existence... I saw her! For a brief moment, ...in that cab. And she seemed... ...to be dying. Provincial detectives laugh at me behind my back because I rely on the spirit world ...to bring criminals to justice. They call me "Mystic Meg". Little do they know, that London, Cuthbert, is a city built on a mystic network. London is full of forces... that we know nothing about. Even the bollards, Cuthbert, Even the bollards... can have powers. To placate the Fax Devil, press: # # 6 * * 6 # * 6 And garland your fax machine with Dogwood rows. Let not the hand of an unclean woman press the keys or cast a shadow across the display during her term. Best of all, banish her to a tent in the wilderness during her unclean time, rather than test the gall of the Fax Spirits... The papier-mache fingerbob wards against piratical junglist radio signals transmitted by the deranged from the tower block barrels of south... east... London... I would just like to say that in my opinion today's events are based upon the idea that, well, the very truth, that the world as we know it today has become a cesspit of blood, excrement and sperm!... What the fuck's going on?! - Hey! Where's you takin' him? - Shut it! - Shut it yourself! -... your fuckin' mouth! Bethnal Green, primary school: arson, and mutiny. Put it on the map. Other reports, sir: Officer Pferdfuss reports a grass-blade incident in Tufnell park. Officer 24172 reports "a scouring of the inner ear" in Wembly. And officer 9391 reports: "a smegma trumpet..." "...passing south from Stamford Hill". It's all over, sir... Our entire constabulary has gone insane. Put them on the map. The Minister for Fisheries and the Tube controller Schlauch have been apprehended, Sir. Shall I have them brought to you for questioning? Yes, Cuthbert. Taxi drivers, though, ...causing such a jam up! I think, Janice, you'll find that most taxi drivers ...suffer from extreme mental illness. Therefore, I think it quite unkind of you to bring this matter up. If you should succumb to Possession, the cure shall be to eat of singing insects. If their legs rise above the heads of them, you shall eat. If their legs rest below the ears of them, you shall not eat, for they are winged, creeping things and an abomination! Sit down, gentlemen. Mr. Schlauch. Mr. Spottiswoode. Sir, I think there's something... - ...appearance-wise, that... - Silence, Cuthbert! Gentlemen, what are your names? Cuthbert, guide my hands to their foreheads. Let them go, but have them followed! They might lead us somewhere... We are not dealing with a normal criminal element... We shall have to abandon all normal police procedure. The Astral Child who represents existence itself... is dying. I shall continue my enquiries on the Astral Plane. Who is there? - Is there someone there? - I am here. Are you an evil spirit? No, don't use gesticular language with me, please, I am blind. - Are you a guide? - Yes. So is there a new presence? Yes. On this and every plane. He is closing things down. Who is he? - No one knows. - Where is the Astral Child - who represents existence? - In the sewer. He has put her there. - Where is he? - In Edmonton. He is here and everywhere. He is closing things down. His victims will lead you to him and the Astral Child, and the gate. As we speak, they are passing my earthly form. Leave now. Soon the Astral Plane will be downsized. Search him in the spirit places. I will. Where am I? We're going shopping. And then we're going to the bank. You like our little shopping trips, don't you, Mr. Brown? No I don't. Going in for your fags. - What? - Your fags, Mr. Brown. You're short again, Mr. Brown. - What? - We'll have to go to the bank. - Bank? - You're 40 p short. I'll buy your fags and you can pay me back when we get to the bank. - What? What? - Stay here. I'm not going anywhere in a hurry, am I? Where am I? Why aren't we home yet? Truck turned over at Monte... Monte Cassino... We had that Rommel... the Desert Rats... Nurse! Two sons... Never got to see them... You were born in a house, with a stream at the bottom of the garden... I wanna be young again? I wanna wipe it all out. - Are you there? - Yes. Am I home yet? Yes, you're home. Home already? Oh, good. Right, I've got your fag, Mr. Brown. We're gonna go to the bank! Bleedin' bank! Less of that! Mabel Lewis... Against the bus stop. Nice tight muff! Mr. Brown, we're in the bank! Well, eveyone needs their shag in the morning! I need a shag in the morning! Nurse... You need a man with experience... Not one of them young fellows crawling all over ya... You need a man who's got experience! Sorry about this... It's worse than normal. Be quiet or you won't get any dinner! You haven't been feedin' me properly... Poison! I should'a married that Mebel Lewis! Instead, I settled for that bitch. That well poisoner! She stole my golf clubs! It's the kind of woman she was! She'd steal your golf clubs as soon as say jack! One day soon you will be like me... Pushed around... Drenched in your own piss... Right. Just get your money. I want a money transfer order, for the country's entire assets, to the account of Mister Albert Brown! Ah... I'll just phone for authorisation. Geff Plow. YES THE TRANSACTION IS AUTHORISED Yes, the transaction is authorised. Willis reporting... a haunting peacock... soliloquy. Has officer Willis been following the victims? It may be our only hope. Yes, as far as Hyde Park... - But... - But? His last radio reprot stated that... "...Their vector is snakelike but..." ...determined. Like a vehicular vector. ...sans vehicule. - ''...sans vehicule''. This is not officer Willis' habitual vernacular, sir. I'm afraid that even Willis has become insane. - He's lost them. - I fear so, sir. Cuthbert... Do you think that everything that happens is inevitable? Yes. What do we do? Crawl in the dust... grovel and beg. Weep tears and cry out... I've never known you to give up so easily, sir. Cuthbert, get the ouija board! Good day, sir. Can I ask you what you're doing? I'm returning to Japan. I have had enough! By which route? Below in the lake, there's a pipe that goes Sloane Square, under Russia, all the way to Japan! - Japan... - As a young man, I swam that pipe, from Komatsu - Kom... what? - Komatsu. Maybe, I'm too old for the journey. My flesh is old. But my spirit is young! The next time... I see the sun... it'll shine over the Caspian Sea, where the sturgeon swim. Do you want to come? The Caspian Sea?... When I was in Ruthenia before the war... I saw a man who played the "zimbalo". And he had a performing chicken. He made just enough to live on, and his wife... was very very beautiful. Thank you, rabbi, for that illuminating story. For those of you who have just tuned in, this is an emergency debate about on the unusual state of the nation. News just in: the stock market has imploded. A massive amount of money was withdrawn from one bank causing everyone to call in their debts. Soon it transpired that everyone owed everybody else money and no one actually had any themselves. And further developments on the tube: It appears that the Underground System is to be renamed the Underworld System, and will to be used exclusively to ferry the dead to the Valley of the Last Judgement. Now, over to Westminster Palace: Once again, I'll make it quite clear: We have checks and balances, balances and checks, in place, to prevent this kind of thing! There is no chance that I or my superiors would authorise the transfer of the nation's assets to any unauthorised account... - Hang on, we got a weirdo... - Excuse me? - What's he got there? - Get a close-up. - Is this interview finished? - It's a mango! Cross stuck in it... Spirits! Spirits of the dark... Are you there? Knock, once, if you are there. Good. - Cup of tea? - Oh! Go away! The circle is broken! We shall have to try again. Spirits! Answer!... Astral Child... Are you there...? That is not the Astral Child, it's an interfering spirit! Spirit! - What is your name? - N... O... - Get this down Cuthbert! - It stopped. Spirit, spirit... What is your name? N... - O... - "No", "no"... Is "No" your name? Y... E... S... Are you a mischievous spirit? A joker?? I want to speak to the Astral Child! N... O... Hark... The animals come... One by one, pair by pair, Antilope, oxen llama and hare. Mew, moo, low and bark, to the Ark. Brown brick monolith By Talgarth Road in Hammersmith. Noah, patriarch, awaits them there. Pair by pair... And one by one, he strings them up. From aft to fore. Lo! The animals hanging there, antilope, oxen, llama and hare. What have we got? Hjkhl nnn gehenom... nbnb... We will drag our corpses... Fff... drrd. And hang them above our souls. Kkhann... By the M25. Ttt ... To the question "Where have you put the Astral Child who represents existence?" He answered: "In the sewer. Where she belongs." Cuthbert... We are going to need a bigger circle. Get the tea ladies. We are joined by Janice Waily, Abel Mularchy and rabbi Moses Golem, to comment on the situation. Janice? Yes, well, experts are now saying that the Pound now actually has a negative value! I mean to say, if you pay someone now in Sterling they actually owe you money! And what's more, money with interest. What actual implications does this have? What is happening to the country? Abel. Why why why why why must we have this passive passive sense? "What is happening to our country?" "What is happening to our country?" What it's lacking is a sense of moral responsibility. The question should be: what are we doing to our country? It's the M25, sir. North-west. This is the sign, Cuthbert. Get the car. I think we should pass, for a more humanist point of view, over to the rabbi, please. Well, as ever it's the question of choices: do you simmer the dumplings in hot water and then transfer them to the chicken broth, or do you simmer them in the chicken broth in the first place? Now you may think this is a sort of academic question, but no. Because you then have to choose between the flavour on the one hand and the disintegration on the other and that is a microcosm... We must be out to pin the blame somewhere! Where do we start? Abel. In the case of the school mutiny and fire, I think it quite obvious that the responsibility lies with the children themselves! No, no, no, no, no, Abel. That bares no relation to reality. I am the mother of two children and I never let them out of my sight. Never out of my sight! They're not allowed to watch television or go to school! Consequently they will, I assure you, grow up with high, I say high, moral standards! It's the parents and the teachers who are to blame! But, but today's events defy explanation, don't they? Well, if they defy explanation, what are we doing here? I've often wondered... But the country seems gripped, gripped... Gripped by what, Ivul? Gripped by mass psychosis. This is nonsense! It's utter nonsense. Once again we attribute guilt to a spurious collective - rather than to individual culprits. - Abel... -Ah! Please... Abel, if I may, if I may, Abel... -No, please, no, let me finish. Please. Can we get back to the point? No one seems to be making any sense anymore, Even the police seem to have brains of truncheon meat. Our society is vapid, meaningless... and violent. - Who's to blame? - The children! With their buggy eyes and their bulbous bodies! They're taking over the nation, them and their accursed trainers! Yes, yes, I couldn't agree more. I think, someone has to take the blame. And the finger has to be pointed, I'm going to point the finger - at my own offspring. I agree with that! You little bastards! Did you hear the man? Did you hear the nice man? - Did you hear me? - Yes, did you hear him? Have one of them over here and I'll give him a good seeing to... - Really, Abel? Would you? - Absolutely. - Would you?? - Absolutely, I'd feel obliged to help. - Well I shall unchain them shortly. No, leave them chained, I prefer it that way. Well, well, we could talk forever... Is there a solution? Yes. I have it here. It's a tuning fork. I acquired it through the... Sunday Times "Recent innovations" booklet. "Tuning Fork of Annihilation: "Broadcast the melodious hum of this durable, stainless steel of tuning fork across the airwaves, and cause the destruction of all domestic televisions and the death of all children who hear it." - Wow. What will they think of next? - Shall we give this one a bash? Why not? - Give it a ting... - Yes... Oh no! The BBC would like to apologize for the widespread destruction and loss of infant life. Faster, Cuthbert, faster! Let's not take all day! Do not attempt to leave the station as this is impossible. The unofficial, unconfirmed spiritual force has taken possession of all London Underground stations. The next trains arriving on all platforms are carrying the souls of the dead on their final journey from all the gathering rooms of the Afterworld. But is there a spiritual angle to today's events? Can a religious spin be put on them? We have with us rabbi Moses Golem, who died two years ago but, we're very happy to say, has been exhumed for today's broadcast. Rabbi? Since our beginnings we have been watched over by the gods. At first by Wotan and the Norns, and subsequently by successive generations of watching deities. ...Unfortunately, however, over the centuries the quality of the deities has somewhat declined due to relentless intermarriage, until, now, sadly, we are left with an inbred halfwit. His name? His name? Dave. Guess what screen I'm thinking about. Screen... - 437. - No. - 326? - No. 22... 4. How'd you guess that? Intuition. That crack in the pavement's got bigger, Dave. Now I've... I've always liked them chimneys. Hey, Dave... - See that again? - Oh god... Oh dear... Tosser! ...Put a stop to that right away... Now I... I like the interactive side of this job. I'm bored. What's that? Dave... It's come to my attention that you, are the most vacuous being in the universe. Me? Really? That's why you've been selected for The Great Toss. What's a...? What, like, I won somthing 'ave I? Dave Dave Dave... Don't, don't try and speak. It doesn't become you. Your days of watching are over. You alone can see everything. You watch but totally confused by what you see. This is your opportunity to make everything simple. Dave, there's too much stuff in the world! And people keep on making more and more stuff! They're stuffing the world with stuff! Dave, imagine the purity of a blank screen. We need to make everything disappear. All those voices. All those things. All that stuff. I'm talking about - erasure. The train you are riding is bound for glory. You are being taken to a new land, where work is plentiful and love abounds. Your lives were empty. But now they're full. Now you have joined us, we are as one. Brothers and sisters, the time has come. No cars. No pigeons. No... legs! No... houses! No dogs! It's the beauty of life, without the trappings. Well, Dave... Think you've got the idea. London's a big city. You have a long task ahead of you. Start on the outskirts and work your way towards the center. No shops. No parks. No... skirts... You will not find this peace in the Book of Revelation! You will not find this peace in the Sayangita! In the book of the Cloud of the Unknowing! You will not find this peace in your personal message machine that tells you you must meet someone 8:30 outside your local Odeon! Can you hear me? Can you take this in? And finally - London is being erased. Most of the outskirts, suburbs and external zones have been entirely downsized. The erasing force is moving its way inwards But the essential zones are still, thankfully, intact. Keep medicines out of the reach of children. The refugees were found urinating in container trucks. Do not drive or operate machinery. The man from Del Monte says - Yes. L'oiseau chante avec ses doigts. Get into the car! The manager and his staff welcome you to Brighton! But embassador, you're spoiling us! If music be the food of love, play on. Hear my prayer O Lord, Hide not thy face from me in the day of my distress. Incline thy ear unto me, For my days con... consume away like smoke. My bones are burned as a firebrand. And my heart is smitten like grass, and withered. And I forget to eat my bread. Cuthbert, I sense you seem troubled. It's lucky you can't see, inspector. Why is it lucky I can't see, Cuthbert? And no police! No windows. - Who are you? - It is I. - I will lead you. - Where? The answer is different but the questions are important ...her vagina that smells of the fish of Hades! I take you thirteen! Thirteen! Thirteen times it cums! And 13 times a droplet of my semen shall she suck as on my penis... To redeem thyself now... Yes, yes, you can laugh, but...! The world will end in half an hour. You have half an hour to reconcile yourselves with the end of transmissions, the end of all signals, the end of data! Free yourselves from this tiny-minded, ten finger fascism! From the of despotism of decimality! The decimal system is the numera... ... ...the Devil! Translate your mind into binary! The zero is the hole! The woman's hole! The one is the phallic creative principle. Translate! Before it's too late! None of you are really there. Prepare... To face zero! Let this edifice, henceforth be known as "Keith's Column"! Avoid the void! No doors. No bricks. No mortar. No roofs. No Privet hedge. Kneel. Stretch out your hands! No steet lights, no shops, no busses, no grills, no bollards, no pavement, no tarmac... It was her and he did not listen! He walked on! He walked by! We are God's people! ...neurotic! NASA filth! FBI! CIA! Engaged in funded chaos! Ye Germans shall go to the lake of fire with their Ginger spice! They're approaching the planet! Approaching the planet now! We must listen! The wrath of God... Signal shutdown... Release. He's here for you. He will open your eyes. Reach your hand up! - Tell me your name. - No. - Is that your name? - Yes. So is this the promised End? Yes... Could I have prevented this? No. We will drag our corpses And hang them above our souls, by the M25. No St. Paul's. No Canary Wharf... whatsit. No Nat-West Tower. No birdsong. No sound. No... substance. No light. No Dave.
