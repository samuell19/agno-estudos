NARRATOR: Far away and long ago in the city of old Baghdad, it was the Caliph's birthday and jugglers and dancers were doing their best to entertain him. The Caliph's son, Prince Achmed, was young and eager for adventure. Suddenly from the crowd came an old man leading a strange artificial horse. lt is a magic horse, o ruler of the world. (LAUGHS ) lt flies through the air. The Caliph was delighted with the horse and wanted to buy it but the owner, who was a magician, would not sell it. But he said he would let Prince Achmed have a ride on the magic horse. The magician showed Achmed the lever in the horse's head and suddenly, up, up he flew on the magic horse. But the magician had not told him how to bring it down to earth again. The Caliph arrested the magician but Prince Achmed sailed ever higher and higher. Finally, Achmed found a lever by the horse's tail and suddenly, the horse began to descend. He was now east of the sun and west of the moon and below him were the magical islands ruled over by a bird princess. lt was said that whoever could steal the feather dress of the bird princess would have the power to make her follow him and become his slave. Achmed had fallen in love with the bird princess and asked her to be his wife and return with him to Baghdad. ln Baghdad, the magician was wondering what had happened to his horse and Prince Achmed. But the princess's attendants flew to the rescue. Great was the excitement in Baghdad when the people saw Achmed returning on the magic horse. The Caliph was overjoyed to see his son again and was delighted with his beautiful daughter-in-law. Everyone had forgotten the magic horse, except the magician. And neither of them was ever seen again.
