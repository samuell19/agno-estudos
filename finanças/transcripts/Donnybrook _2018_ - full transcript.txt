Lucky he didn't steal this, too. I'll get you a deal on it. Whatever you want. Donny, I need the money now. My, uh.. My wife, uh.. She's pissed. What did you say he looked like? I already told whoever answers the damn phone over there who stole the shit. It was Jarhead Earl. Yeah. He took a whole grand in a plastic bag. That's just enough to get him to the Donnybrook. The best I can give you is, uh.. This kid catches a beating or a bullet. Besides, there's worse things in the world than a vet trying to win a fight and pull himself up by the bootstraps. Hey. That's my last one, man. - Go ahead. - Thank you. Take any.. Whatever you want.. Okay, let's pull up here, just.. Come on, come on. - Why have we stopped? - Hang on, hang on. It's just the car.

The way you hit that, too. That's right. I'll hold the bag. Here you go. Hit that left. Now get that right. Now get that hip into it. Get the hip into it. Alright. That's it. - Hurts, right? Yeah. - Yeah. It hurts. We don't have to do anymore. Sarah. Hi. It's okay. Hi, look, I... I don't... I don't need anything. I'm just.. I'm working right now. I just.. I just.. I just wanted to see you. - What? - I'm trying. What? I had a beer. I.. Sarah, I'm trying. Okay? I can't even remember the last time I messed with that other shit. Okay, I know you hate me. Can't you just stop and talk to me for a second? Angus came by my house, Don. When? A couple of times. With his sister. Wanted to know if there are any customers still around. Did he hurt you? Hey! Did he hurt you? No. You did. Let me go. Let me go! Let me go! Betting that's a .380. His brother was a classmate of mine. He was a good guy until he drank his liver black. Little Eldon. He was the pride of the family. Hey. DNA too. I know who he was fucking. Will you take that fucking mask off? Eldon gets the same bullet as the tweaky brothers. Angus is setting to cook a new batch somewhere. So write it up? Motherfucker. He is the reason everything's going to hell. What you gonna do? I'm gonna find him. Who'd Eldon owe money to? That I don't know. - You don't know? - No. Well, then, how about this one? Where's Angus right now? Cookin' somewhere, surely. That's helpful. How much powder were those moron brothers holding? That's none of your business. Besides, I thought I'd be the one to ask questions. If that's alright with you. Angus is the devil, man. I'd just leave him alone. Well, somebody's got to kill the devil now. Ain't that right? Besides.. ...what else am I gonna do? I bet you're still holding some of that powder. Ooh! Yeah! Get the fuck out of my car. Fuck you. Preach this. Give me. Give me it all. Give me it all. Fuck you, motherfucker! - Where's Angus? - I... I... I don't know. Where the fuck is he? - Hey, now, don't.. - What? Come on. Enough. That's enough of that. Are you gonna win that Donnybrook? Think I got a shot? - Mm-hm. - You do? They'll literally have to kill me. And if they couldn't kill me over there they're sure as hell not going to kill me over here. Yes, sir. Now get some sleep, will you? Goddamn. Hi. Hi. Are you alright there? Uh, it broke down a ways back. Is that a limp you got? I picked that up in Afghanistan. - Is that right? - Yeah. You need a ride, soldier? Yes, sir. Hoping to meet up with my sister. Sister, huh? Older or younger? Much younger. A little sister. That's just great. Bet you spend half your life trying to keep the boys off her. Something like that. Just like my son did. He's done real well. Wife.. ...four kids. My grand kids. At this point I just have to pinch myself. I mean, how big a success can this kid be? Where's it come from? College? High school? Military, like yourself there. I mean, where? I don't know. I do. Success is something you build long before a... a promotion or a job. It's... it's.. It's generations deep. How you take care of your family. How you care for the ones that are closest to you. That's where it starts. Would you mind pulling over up here? I gotta take a piss. Oh, sure. What are you gonna do with that? That's what I call success. Where are we going? We're looking for a fight. We're down, so gotta make a crack somehow. Now, you're gonna stay here, just like we said, okay? I'm looking for a fight. - I'll get a beer. - Yeah, I got you. $2.50. Ah, is that the pot, fellas? Yes, sir. Come on, pussy. I got plans later. Pick a man. - Come on.. - Go get 'em! - Come on, man! - Come on, Wolf. Show him what you're made of. Get up, pussy! You gotta take that shit! Get up, pussy! Get up, big guy. Come on. - Wow! - What a man! Take that down, killer. Bad! Man.. You ever hear of the Donnybrook? Yeah, yeah. That's where we're headed. Semper? Semper Fi. Name's Poe. Promoter's fee, mind you. Cops! - Where? - Inside. What? I got a truck. Let's go, okay. What is this? I keep an office. You want a beer? They're cold. Thank you. Do you got a phone? I just need to check in with the wife. Yeah. Be my guest. Thanks. Good evening. Hey, lady, how're you doing? Hey, daddy. You sound tired. Are you okay? Mama's bad. She is? You want to put her on the phone for me, baby? - Just hold. - Hey, Scout. Yeah. You still ready for Candy Land? Born ready. Jar? - Did you win? - No, we're not there yet. We still got a ways to go. You should come and get us soon. Okay, baby. I love you, Jar. Okay. I gotta go. I love you so much. You devil. You didn't mention you had a girl with you. - Did she come alone? - I don't know. Who's she with? Did you see anyone with? I don't know. Why? Where the hell you come from? I saw you at the bar. Uh-huh. I knew you were going to the Donnybrook. I thought we could pair up. Watch each other's back. Where's your brother? He's gone. Cops. Proposition for you. You got no vehicle, no safe place to stay. You're still a day's journey from McGill's plot of land. Who's McGill? The Nazi who runs Donnybrook. So? So I get you out of here, stash the boy safe for a couple days and get you to the brook. Like hell. I'm staying with you. No. Don't you worry about it. We're gonna figure this out, okay? Donnybrook's no place for a kid. Alright, what do you want from me? You win, then we peel off more of that pot. Like tonight, promoter's fee. If you stay here, nothing but handcuffs for you juvie for him. I can go with. When I get to the Donnybrook, I can just sell what's in this bag and disappear. What's his name? Moses. Is this it? This is it. My guy's boat won't have a trace of a cruiser to it. It'll look like you're on the river fishing. - Smoke? - I don't smoke. Been waiting for you. This is Ann. Hi. We ain't got no more blankets. That's alright. This is fine. We'll head out tomorrow. The boy'll be alright with her. - Thank you. - Hm. Don't thank me yet. We still have to discuss a fee. If that's alright? Yeah. I'll be right back. Don't go anywhere. There's a pillow here if you want to lay down or something. Single or double? Where is she? One more. I haven't seen her, man. To my sister. Delia. Let me just.. She'll be back tonight, man. Donny? What do you want? I called you a bunch, boss. I gotta repeat the question? The girl was spotted. The girl? The girl Delia. With Jarhead Earl. Scrapping at a bar on their way to the Donnybrook. No Angus? Gotta be close by, I figure. You got a name for this bar? Single or double? I know the man who did that to your face. Well, have at him. Maniac stole my truck and my Weatherby too. His looking for his sister. She was selling crank couple evenings here peaked his interest. Girl is long gone, but I told him she'd be back tonight. He'll come around. Gives me a chance to get my shit back. I'll be in the parking lot. Ready, motherfucker? You're looking for me, deputy? What the fuck are you looking at? I'm looking at a dead man. Me too. Wasn't looking or anything. It's alright. It's fine. Yeah, I was just, uh.. There is a blanket right there if you want it. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Scrub up good? I highly recommend it. A swim? That too. Why didn't you, uh.. ...take the money? Back in my trailer with your brother? I saw you. You, you saw the bag. I don't know why. What are you doing here, Delia? Going to the Donnybrook. I don't know a man in my life that, um.. ...doesn't want to use me, you know? Then I see the way that you treat Tammy, you know? How you act for your kids. I guess it just made me wonder, you know? I'll go check him out. You know, it's just a couple of days. We're gonna be riding high back to those girls. You're as strong as they come. Say it. I'm as strong as they come. Yes, you are. - You gonna be alright? - Mm-hm. You're a good man. - Bye. Love you. - Yeah. Ain't far now. These bikes yours? Can I ride one? Ain't you gonna pedal away? No, sir. I ain't afraid. You comin' in with us? No. I'm just the messenger. Time for you to fight, son.
