The shadows are okay, but screw the pants. - Jonathan, it's a business. - Shut up, Steve. We extend, he is angry that he was defeated. - Beginner's luck. - No, that Conway is not a beginner. Ten thousand hours, 98% victory rate. He's not playing scrubs - to get these numbers. - Maybe I'll learn something from him. I know what I'm doing.

I want a thousand dollars a day to use that crap. And be more of a man, asshole! Pulse, where have you been, man? - Out there, in the real world. - Reality sucks. Who else is online? Crock, are you there? Shit, he's AFK. Game update. Server is not ready yet, I can't connect. It's over. PATCH DISTRIBUTION IN PROGRESS NO SERVER AVAILABLE - Hello? - Tyler Conway? Richard Brixton. We need to talk. I understand the emotion. Walking through strange worlds, chasing your enemy, choose the right weapon, make a clean kill. It's incredible, I was lost in that. I never had much skill, or whatever it is, I don't know. But I was always able to recognize a talent. You represent Jonathan Spencer. There is a new generation in the city. Children playing Playstation before they can walk. Sounds familiar? It was Xbox, actually. Right. So, what do you think of someone making games for you? I have no problem finding a game. I am in several pictures. I'm not talking about your neighbors' LAN, where you get a $ 15 voucher to use at your local electronics store. Or in great equipment. Great equipment. I'm talking about sponsors. Partnerships, airline tickets, hotel stays, paid registration. And then you play, and if you win, we split the profits in half. Who do you think makes these deals? Who do you think brings it all together? - You? - IT'S. I think I can get you. At this stage in your career, need someone with contacts, that you can call and say, "hey, you don't know who I'm talking about, but he will be the next sensation, Tyler Conway ". So you're going to make me a legend? I'll turn you into a professional. The money is in the tournaments, and to compete in the tournaments, have to be on a team. If I decide to take the conversation forward, I can put you in one of the best teams. - What? - Nefarious. - It's Jonatham's team. - It was Jonatham's team, had some setbacks. What do you say? Partners? Need an attacker? - Dave, my brother! - What is happening? How are you? - Good. So this is the place. - Yeah, we're getting better. - Richard Brixton is signing the check. - Brixton. - Brixton. - That guy fluctuates a lot. Let's enjoy it while we can. Where do I get? Down the hall, up there. There. - Hi, you probably don't remember... - Water Venus. IT'S. Yeah, come on in. We haven't opened yet, we may never open. We have tuna. Not me... Jonathan fought badly with the aide, and destroyed the hotel room. I live outside the city, and I remembered the name of your restaurant. And I know you don't know me, and that you can be a serial killer... - But I was wondering if I can sleep here. - Yes. - Yes, no problem. Feel free. - It will only be for one night. Kate, you can stay as long as you want. But if you're going to kill me, be quick, right? Hey, man, I wanted to know... Kate, Dave Foreman. Dave, Kate Valery. So, Ty, when do the others arrive? They must be coming. Tyler Conway. Yeah man! Yeah, I was on the LAN when you destroyed Spencer. My God, you were like... And I was like "damn", and Jonathan was like "damn it"! Man, thanks for pissing you off, and for making you give up. Don't mind, man, Jonathan is an asshole. I was ready to give up, anyway. Right. Do not believe me. Got it man, I'm listening to you. In fact, I'm Cranked. Or Steve, whatever. Right. I'll post 15 tweets a day, ten on Facebook, and on Tumblr for 250 a week. Right? Are we agreed? Okay, very good. I send you the bio, the photos and everything else. Ego, we finally met. Do me a favor, man. Call me by my real name, Wayne. We are a trend. I think you really broke up with Spencer. I would get a bodyguard if I were you. Okay, boys. Make yourself at home. I didn't even know she was part of the deal. Yeah, if I were you, I'd get two bodyguards. What are you doing? Hanging up my stuff. Should I put it elsewhere? Weird. Take a deep breath. Exhale, squeeze the trigger calmly. Security lock. Okay, buddy, try again. Hey, are you okay? It looks like you saw a ghost. This place is not haunted, right? No more or less. I grew up here, helped out in the kitchen, loaded tables, family business. So, where were you living? I have some friends and Die-Hard Diablo Nuts. I was staying with them and sleeping at my uncle's house. Is that come back... It is no longer my home. So make it be. Hey, isn't it weird to be playing in a restaurant? It is not a restaurant, it is the Conway Games House. I tweeted this, posted it on Instagram, and we already have ten thousand followers. - Did you turn off the cell phone location? - I will do that now. Too late, man. Once on the internet, forever on the internet. Wait, what's our name like? Time Cantina? - What do you think of Shadow of Fire? - It looks like a horse's name. Do not wait. Omen. - Isn't it kind of dark? - Steve, we're like robot killers. - Yeah, what about Heavy Bombs? - Okay, I prefer Omen. Yes, Omen, I like it. Richard wants me to be the team leader. Yeah, it seems. - Is there a problem with that? - Yes, I don't leave Jonathan's team to obey another sensation of the moment. I've always been part of the team, now I should be the team leader. Is there a problem with that? Okay, Steve. - You can lead. - Thank you. If you beat me one-on-one. DOOM CRANKED, 7620 MATCHES, 87% VICTORY RATE, 6658 VICTORIES Lucky Strike. - Wait a second! - Dude, I'm just getting started. Time! What is this thing, from the 1960s? Damn man! Best of three? I think it's decided, Tyler will give the orders. According? It looks like a joke to me. - Who do you think is to steal my team? - Who left the door open? - Any trash can get in here. - Jonathan, get out. Nice play. So, you took everything. - Seriously? - Hey! Wayne, turn off the location! Off. Shit. Right, thanks. Nice. Yeah, I played a little, but it was at Team Fortaleza. - Not as heavy as Reflex. - How did you start playing? I was bored and had a computer. I was not a very sociable child, everyone made fun of me, people thought I was ugly. Hard to believe. Do not know. At Team Fortaleza, I could be a doctor, a soldier. It brought me power. I was really good. Do you still play? No, I was in a European league for a while, but the time zone and sleepless nights practically killed me. My avatar's name was Mirage. Thank you Richard, components and everything. Shit, speaking of the Devil. Hey, guys, listen up! Detroit is in two weeks. The Midwest Conference. Win and go to Las Vegas. Lose, and you will die on the beach. There are almost a million at stake, don't screw it up. Guys, let's play Montreal SleepyBoyz. It is a unique chance.

Let's go! - Steve, coming in. - Where is he? At the top of the screen. Shit. I'm officially mad. Are you kidding me? He will take the flag, get ready to stop him at the exit! My God, it was the easiest. - I'm after him, get ready! - Okay, I see him. Stop him! Dave, move! I'll take the flag and push it out. Are you kidding? Shit, was it really us? - You used me as bait, don't do it anymore. - I didn't use you as bait, it was an ambush! Okay, and Wayne, shouldn't you be covering for him? Steve. Steve, what happened? - I don't know, man, I left the area. - You left the area. - Did you leave the area? - Seriously? What's up man! Unbelievable. Attitude? What attitude? It is the largest convention in the country. I did this for three years in a row. Okay fine. Shit! - What is the problem? - Venus water fired me. This is crazy, I would buy anything from you. It was Jonathan, he burned me. You know, you don't need them. Do you collect pictures of cupcakes? - Only the ones I do. - You did it? - Yes. - Can I see? They are very, very good. - Thanks. - You could sell. - Seriously? - Yes. Dude, we need to talk. Okay, let's say you're the quarterback. They hit the ball, the defense is coming, and the receiver is free. What do you do? You run up to them, and then you explode with the team for failing to cover you? Is that your strategy? If so, it sucks. Okay, and what's yours, Dave? Block me instead of covering me? - Dave, the team was all over the field. - Tyler. You don't have to prove anything to us. We know it's good, but so are we. - So who are we going to face? - Foraz da Lei, with "Z". - Copenhagen. - Damn Europeans. Thank God it's just a game. GRAVE OUTLAWZ, 562 MATCHES, 70% WIN RATE, 393 WINS Okay, guys, let's aim in the middle. Nice shot, Wayne. The other guys play for a long time. - Dave, are you ready for the carnage? - Wait, don't jump so soon. We can handle it. - He is coming back. - I'm jumping! - Carnage is coming! - Roger that. Follow me! I got the first one, taking the flag now. - Two on me! I'm on the flag. - Good help. I caught him! - Good! - Returning now. We all know it was luck! Yes! Good! Yes, that's what I'm talking about! That was very good! What was the first game you played? The first game? GoldenEye, when I was five. Mario. - Do you remember Spore? - Yeah, crap. I almost went back to playing Haze. Dude, Quake? - Doom. - Yes, Tomb Raider! - Hey, she's hot. - She's so hot. What do you think Richard played? Pong! - Why don't we play again? - Why don't we have a party? - No, a retro game party. - Wayne sends the invitations. Guys, only two pieces left. Playing, getting drunk, it will be too much. Good! LOVE CAKES TO DIVIDE Do you want a piece of my heart? - I forgot the appetizers. - Never mind. Jesus! Calm. - Need help? - Not alright. To new beginnings, for both of us. No hard feelings? IT'S. - How do you call it? - Control-Alt-Delete. You know, it's weird, at parties, people ask me what do I do. The last thing I would say is that I am a gamer. - But today, we're all gamers, man! - IT'S! Did you see Kate? It's ok. - Guys, have you seen Kate? - She's with Jonathan. - Come on Kate, take one more with me. - I'm feeling bad. - Wait, what are we doing here? - You said you wanted to talk about us. I did not speak. Let's take your clothes off, so you can breathe better. Jonathan, don't touch me! Skirt! Are you alright? Yes? - Hey, can I? - Yes of course. Do you want tea? Thanks. - How are you feeling? - A little dizzy. What happened? I remember the party, - but we... - No, nothing happened. Kate, what were you doing with Jonathan? - He told me he wanted to go back. - Is that you? Is playing? Ended. So, this is your old room. Yes, I was sitting right there when I played Quake the first time. Kate. I know what it's like to feel helpless. It was after we closed. Someone was hiding when my father locked it. It's all right. Go! Look, there's nothing here. Please don't hurt him! Let's go! - No! - Dad! Dad! I couldn't save him. My dad taught me how to shoot. As if I had predicted it, or something. But when he needed me, I crashed. You were just a child. My mom couldn't cope. She stopped eating. They are together now. Yes, they are getting ready. Of course I'm with them, it's called customer service, buddy. As? What do you think of a limousine? That's how we do it, friend. Unless you want to send a jet. We are ready. Remember to show the logo, right? Make our sponsors happy. Well, get ready. - Finish them. - We will do our best. Understand something about Jonathan, right? Talent is not enough. This guy doesn't just want to beat you, he wants to end you as a person. Look at me. If you want to approach him, when the time comes, talk about his father. He had a problem with gambling. He lost everything, the car, the house, his wife abandoned him. But Jonathan's ego is a wall. In fact, he is very sensitive. See, you have what it takes. Go get them. - Right. - Tyler, are you ready? - F9. - You got it. You are excellent at this. No, I just know how you work. I've seen you play many times. I bet the Venus Water has a mascot. Maybe they'll hire you again. - Mascot, what a respectable job. - Hey, any woman who can sell a car for $ 500,000 wearing only a bikini and spike heels deserves my respect. Don't mind him. When Jonathan started on the Reflex circuit he wanted me close to him, and it made sense. Be his mascot, as if he were stupid. - Yes, but you have talent, you are a gamer. - Not like Jonathan, - he broke up with me in Copenhagen. - Wait, did you play against him? Yes, he was a freshman from Team Fortaleza, in the final, about two years ago. I spent all my money to go, there was no way back home, and he paid for my return ticket. DAD Dave, take this off... - Jesus! - That's how you lose an athlete's scholarship. I was a quarterback in the competition that would take place in Washington. The Miami team came like a runaway train. I can still hear the crack. That's not what hurts me. It's the... It's my father. And the fact that he can't look me in the eye. Look, boys. Uniforms. God, it's like the sun has thrown up. Let's look like FIFA cheerleaders. Motor City is returning to host the Arena Reflex do Oriente Conference. Twenty teams will battle for the next three days, and the winner goes to the finals in Las Vegas. Who wants? IT'S! Look that. Very tasty, note eight. Maybe ten, if she's in the shower. See you at the game, nerd. Members of the Nefarious and Omen teams, please come to the main stage. Tyler, did you do your makeup on Wendy's drive-through? Shut up, Wayne. Dude, see me a combo number three with extra ketchup. Nice uniform! I will end this clown.

It is the first match of three. Ty, did you see anything? - I heard him coming from the right. - It's Jonathan. - I'm going after him. - No, calm down. - Come get me, asshole. - You asked for it, idiot. Tyler, stop! - Ty, you're leaving us without cover! - Tyler, what are you doing? Are you kidding? They had the power of carnage, they are coming now. Get them, Chucky! Kill them all! I'm on his tail. You are terrible. Good game. - Was it a strategy? - No I'm sorry. I just received a message from Nurv. Through the miracle of streaming, they got the first row for whatever it was. They were not impressed, you are almost finished. Go home, asshole! You are obviously not professional. - Delete that photo. - It won't be cool, - You already have a million downloads. - What photo? People are cheering up looking at your curves. Seeing how you like gossip, I thought you would like the exhibition. You asshole! - Erase! - What? - Get off the site! - It never left my cell phone, it was just a montage, you idiot! Team Omen was disqualified for the fight in the Detroit competition. Taking Richard Brixton to take Conway and the rest of the team. Team Spencer won the stage, and went to the finals in Las Vegas. Okay guys, look. Detroit was just an obstacle, right? We will learn and improve. Detroit was not an obstacle, it was a reality check. So yes, I'm going to go back to what's left of my shitty life. Steve? Wayne? PRESSURE TIME IS DEAD. SEPARATED, FINISHED. How are things, folks? I'm building a team. Any gameplay links I can see? I can take you to the stratosphere, but I will not talk about the hotel. I'm Counter Strike. Seriously. I’m Counter Strike. I just left, so I have a lot of time. Give me two weeks, and I'll be the guy at DotA. We're playing Reflex. I was born to play, it's in my DNA. In my past life, I was a CPU. - So, wait for your call? - That's okay. Who was? A guy I met online. He wants to join my team. Your team? You already have a team. Seriously? Well, where are they? They are out there. I could have just apologized, explained that he stepped on the ball and they will still be here. Wait, did I step on the ball? No, they were unable to continue. Tyler, you had a strategy and you were out of balance. I ended up with Jonathan's asshole! I'm surprised that he doesn't support me, maybe I like to lower his pants for him. Don't you dare say you did it just for me. He did this out of his own pride. Worth it? Did you fix anything? Tyler, it's just a game! It is more than a game. You know, I know why you worked so hard to be a good sniper, but you are not responsible for what happened to your father. You need to learn to trust yourself, because until you do that, you will not trust anyone. You will not trust your team, you will not trust me. I think I'll find a place for myself. Good luck, Tyler. I hope you find your team. Tyler, it's Roo. How are you, buddy? Krok here. Ty, are you up to playing? Friend, are you playing? I have to prepare for the Western Conference games. Let's get out of here, he still hasn't recovered from Detroit. Yes for sure. Wait, are you going to play at the North American West Conference? Yes friend. - But you are Australian. - Technically, I'm from California, I was born in Malibu. - Then you are eligible. - That's right. I reviewed the Detroit game, and it was hard to watch. You took us there and I blew it. We were disqualified, we lost the Conference. But I think we still have a chance to play in Las Vegas. It will be much more difficult to get there, but I know we did it. I am... I'm begging you to give me another chance. I'll be here at eight pm on Friday. I hope to see you there. You better do what you say, friend. I dismissed two models for that. - Wayne, come have a drink. - Not so fast, stud. Damn it. The Omen. Back from the dead. Perhaps. So, what is this about? - Dave, you're from Washington, right? - Seattle, born and raised, I'll be back next summer. Assistant coach in Washington. - Congratulations. - Well, that's it. We register the team in your name, it will be our entry. - Wait, entrance for what? - For the Western Conference. - Yes, but Washington is in the top 20. - No, the Arena Reflex Conference. - We won and we're going to the final in Vegas. - Dude, we did badly in Detroit, - we will go bad in Los Angeles! - No, I did badly in Detroit. And it won't happen again. Because Dave, I want you to lead the team. I want to change positions. I do not know, dude. - Wow, man, what the hell is this? - What? - Steve. - Such a decision needs to be talked to the Holy Trinity. My dad is going to kill me. LOS ANGELES FINAL DEPARTURES The main story remains Team Omen, relocated to the Western Conference after a humiliating departure in Detroit. Rising from the ashes, Omen was restructured, with Dave Foreman replacing Tyler Conway as the team leader. The strategy seems to be working, as Omen is standing out, defeating the other 20 teams and breaking records this season as one of the most impressive of the tournament games. The destruction of Korea's FonNgPO means that they are almost reaching the Western Conference if they beat the notorious Time Freakzoids. He plays loudly, I can hear him from a distance. Release the rockets, catch him off guard. Hey, Jonathan, what's up? All official leagues, go to the administration, please. SUNA STATION FREAKAZOIDS, 1326 DEPARTURES, 87% VICTORY RATE, 1154 VICTORIES Watch out for this Leader, I heard he's crazy. Lie. As... He has the power of carnage, the other attacker is not with him. He's down. Damn, it's on my tail. Dave! - Dave, we need to do something! - IT'S. Great strategies. Omen misses the first game of a match with three games. Let's talk about Leader’s performance, it was absolutely violent. There is no way he could have fired the shots. Shit! Excuse me, hey! - Yes? - I think one of them is cheating. He's using an aimbot. See, did you see how the aim attaches to the target? You can't go wrong. It is a flaw in your video. - Would you like? - No. What a... There is only one thing to do. Raise the level of our game. Let's get into that carnage fast! Ty, are you with me? Yes, let's do it! He is here. I'll get him. Shit, one more. That's how it's done. Dave, find me on their flag! Turning the corner, pushing now. Shit. Don't worry, I'm here. Go get their flag! I took the flag and I'm going. Shit, I need help. That's what I'm talking about. Wayne, I'm taking the flag. Back me up! Take it home, Dave! - Yes! - Yes! I can't do that, man, I'm almost defeated. One more of these and I'm going to melt. Bullshit, man, you did well, really. No, your moves made us win. You need to be leader of the team again. Okay, let's get them. Omen won game two with the tactic in the Arena Reflex game. Now it can be anyone's. - Get him, he's got the lightning! - Yes, I saw it, we have to kill him now! This is silly. I took their flag. Watch out, we're tied. Steve, take the flag! Wayne, pair with Dave! Understood. Dave, jump, get the flag defender. I entered. I'm jumping on Leader! Steve, they killed me and they're coming! Shit! Look at me! - I caught him! - My God, no! Take this, Steve! Damn these players, I'm taking it, boys! - Yes! - Yes! This team is amazing, I'm lucky to be part of that. They taught me so much. It was a difficult path. I mean, Omen separated for a while. Yes, we forgot why we were together. But we need to find our way back. Any regrets? We said things that we shouldn't. But we are moving on, focusing on Vegas. - Vegas, baby! - Omen! REFLEX ARENA, FINALS, VEGAS SEARCH KATE VALERY You need to like the noise. "Good Omen in Vegas". - IT'S. - "Spencer knows the opponent", - "Omen in Reflex". - IT'S. Hey, Tyler. Guess who it is. Do you want to ruin my day? Got a minute? I'll be back in five minutes. - So you came back. - You came back. Conference champion, very well. - Richard, you gave up on us in Detroit. - You gave up on you in Detroit. Let me tell you something about athletes and business. Assessors need to work with something. Let's talk about your future. Five years from now, he will no longer be a gamer. Let's say you win today. One million dollars, divide by four, two hundred and fifty thousand, less taxes, you get 175 thousand. How far will it take you? Nor will it cover your canteen. Tyler, this is not like boxing, that everyone is watching closely, that it is impossible to change the results. Are you serious? There's a lot of money involved, like 20 million dollars. - I get a lot of it for us. - How much? Two million just to lose? Is it for real? Yes, bettors want Nefarious to win the title and are willing to pay. Let's put it to a vote. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome Omen and Nefarious! TEMPLES OF HEAVEN Wait, don't let them pass. They're coming from the left, get ready Wayne! Okay, start shooting! Take care, shoot over me! Shit, they got in! Wayne, what are you doing? Wayne, run, don't face this fight. Wayne, do you hear? Welcome to the meat grinder. Boys, come on! Steve, they're coming in. Wayne, you got the Tele-Spawn. Stop it when it comes out! He's leaving now! Wayne! Steve, he is difficult! - Shit. - Yes! Yes! - What's wrong with shooting? - Someone has to attack, because Jonathan is breaking up with us, and you left me to die, so... - Yes, I saw Jonathan pass you. - Okay and. You accepted, didn't you? He made a deal with Richard, that's why he's playing so badly. Man, he always plays badly. Yes, I accepted. And you would accept it too, if you were smart. Damn it, Wayne! Steve, relax. Calm. I'm tired. People posting about their great lives. You know, money talks, and losers walk. So walk. Great. Who will be the fourth player? We can't do it with three. We need someone who knows our style. Someone who knows our strategies. Damn boxes, I could say goodbye to everyone. Kate? - What? - You saw us play, you know the strategies. It's time for Mirage to return. I didn't come here to play. See, what you said on Twitch, about finding your way back. It was really cool to see you playing the way I knew I could. We could win every game, and it wouldn't be worth it to lose you. We need you, Kate. I need you. Not just for that. - You are so... - Are you in? Continuing at Arena Reflex, at the championship in Las Vegas, we have a change in the Omen Team. Replacing Wayne Levin with Kate Valery. Leaders, at your signal. - Red Team ready. - Blue team. Ready. MIRAGE, ??? DEPARTURES, ??% VICTORY RATE, ??? WINS Jonathan is here, get ready! Ty, hide, I'll take him to you. He's here, I'm taking it for you. Get ready, now! Kate, come with us. Dave and I are taking it now! Understood. Two guys up front! Tyler, take the flag! - Kate and I got the guys in the middle. - Careful, there are people in front, not yet. - We need distraction. - Leave it to me. They took the bait! Go! Go, Ty! What are you doing? Let's go! What? Did you think you couldn't do that? You're sweating like a pig! Go wash up, you're sweating a lot. Yes, Richard. What an intense, spectacular match. An incredible comeback from Team Omen. Let's go for a quick break and give the robots a well-deserved rest. We are back in half an hour. - The hands. - No! You! There is always someone out there trying to have what you have. Your girl, your job. And they will succeed, unless it is the strongest in the room. And in this moment, this guy is me. You're a tough guy, right? Are you also lucky, just like your father? What did you say? Yeah, your dad loved to win, didn't he? More than anything. He would rather spend his salary playing poker than putting food in his mouth. Did Richard tell you that? Screw U. - Where's Tyler? We are back in ten minutes. - He went to... How much time do we have? Three minutes. - Shit, Tyler, you can't play! - Yes I can! - No, I'll tell the officers, okay? - No! - They'll kick out the Spencer cheaters. - No, he will say that I started, - just like in Detroit. - It's ok. I will play. And we will beat him. Okay, let's go. What happened here? I slipped in the water in the bathroom. Ty, don't accept this fight, go away. - Guys, I don't know how long I will last. - Hold on, we'll make it. It ends now. Come on, you little shit. No! What are you doing? Dave, run! Here we go. I'm covering you up, go! Almost there, getting in the middle now. I'm on the bridge. Shit. Yes! I caught. - Shit, Jonathan is after me! - Yes, I see. I will stop you! I lost sight of Jonathan, get ready. Come on, Jonathan, where are you? Yes! That's what I'm talking about! That's what I'm talking about! EIGHT MONTHS LATER LOVE IN BYTES Winning requires taking risks. Try this. Okay, it's a grenade launcher. It's sensitive, so if you shoot, can put on the wall, it drops. If you hit someone, it will just explode. See how the carnage is coming, right there, he's going after it. You have to press the space bar continuously, it will give you speed. It was very good. Thank you for sharing my dream. - It's daring to risk everything on cakes. - Venus favors the bold. - You know, it's nice to come together on your LAN. - Our LAN. Dave closed a game on the Atlantic City servers. - Seriously? Who are we going to play against? - The Swedes. Shit, they're really good. We need new strategies. Good, I'm thinking of some. We can. subtitles: Perfect
