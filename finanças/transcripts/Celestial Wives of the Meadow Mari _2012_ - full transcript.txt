I've already heard this story a million times! Lumshay! Lumshay's son! Your Mom and Dad will be back soon. Okanai Oshanyak When will you come to visit next? I don't know. Ask your mother to let you spend half the summer here! Kilemary isn't more fun, is it? Go on, eat! How flat you are, Oshanyak! You're not a stalk and not a stick. When will stuff start coming out? Let me get your beauty moving. Come here and get undressed! Auntie Okanai - Come on over here! Why do I have to get undressed? Come here! Hurry up, move it! Auntie Okanai! Ven'ka and I dry ourselves with this! Ven'ka's a good husband! I'll lure out your beauty - you'll see! What are you doing! It hurts! You're a beauty, Oshanyak! You're not a stalk! I'll share with you! I have enough to spare! It won't be long now! Don't tell your mother, though. Onya Onya, what's wrong? Did you and Ondik have a fight? No, but... He went to the fair in Shin'sha. I think he found a woman there. Why do you say so? He bought a bagpipe. He came back so happy. Playing all the time. He doesn't ask for me or for food. Someone fed him well and made him happy there. You know what - look at him. Have you looked? Right there. Look closely. You know your own smell. No, I haven't looked. Go and look now. Before he remembers and washes it. He might have already washed, if he's smart. Maybe he's gone mad and forgotten everything? Go... and smell it! Show me... your penis! Who taught you such a thing? Who have you been with? Shut up... Shut up, Venera! Well... did you look? As soon as he heard it, he grabbed me... Threw on the bed... Now it's too late to look... Oropti How are things, Oropti? Fine, Ovda. Let me pass. I love your husband. Let me have one date with him. Are you out of your mind? Oropti, my dear. I've loved him for ages. He'll only make love to me once. I won't come to you ever again. No. Don't ask for that. What's with you? Just think about it... You have blind hedgehogs in your belly. Unborn nuthatches. You breastfeed martens and badgers. So my husband will stick it in you, and then into me? Just think. Farewell. You'll come for me yourself. What's that, Oropti? Don't. It'll scream! No! No! Ovda hexed me this morning. That's the cry of the stone curlew- a rare bird in the forest. It lives in ravines. Runs in fields at night. Her milk dried up that same day. She speaks in strange voices. I am the one she is scared of most! I don't know. Come out! Come out! Eat! Look, this is delicious! Come out, curlew! Eat! Come out, curlew! I'll rip your head and wings off! I'll break your wings! Eat! My sweetheart... You went to Ovda, didn't you? Get up, Oropti, my love. Osika Your Osika's been gone a long time. Blue moose! The bathhouse is getting cold. We took God knows who into our home. Blue moose! My darling! Walk around the swamp. Find yourself some moose. You won't live with my Misha. I don't like you, daughter-in-law. The moose goes from hard soil to dampness. Follow him and stay on the swamp! Ochina We'll jump around like bunnies! Our old men will jump from their graves and chase to grope us! Stop dreaming! Hare pate won't work like that anymore! What if it works? Oshalyak Farewell, Paranga and boredom! I was invited to study in the city! They said I'll sing in Kazan, in Moscow! Dear hometown, I'll never forget you! Farewell! Hi, Miss Lida! Hi, Oshalyak! I'll take two tar soaps and a purple washcloth. This one? You can't be a performer! You'll wither away. I'll save up from my scholarship. Thanks! Goodbye! Goodbye, Oshalyak! Please, don't leave. I'm begging you. Why? Stop chasing after me. I'll never love you. Never. Go I'll send a nice one after you. He'll crush you. Mister Gennady! You can just call me Gena! One moment! Please! I see you have no ID on you. Go back where you came from. Hurry! And take along the one who sent you! Love, love! We'll have the wedding in Paranga. Oshtylech I should have a husband like this! Ormarche I want to go with you, too! Why did you come here? You're only twelve! Too early for the kissel festival! Get out of here! I want to stay with you, please! Okay, but you have to be quiet. No talking! Drink this kissel, our dead ones. Help yourselves! Don't be mad at us. We didn't forget you. Give us health and good husbands. Have you had enough to eat and drink? Have more. And so will we. Let's play hoof. Where are you going, Ormarche? To the bathroom. Don't lie! I really have to go! I can't hold it anymore! You piece of shit! Grandma! Grandpa! They're in the dining hall! They've turned into our guys! Oh, God! Again! They spilled our kissel! God, help us finally get rid of them! They're in the dining hall! Olika "Autumn" "Gentle" "Grass" Will you marry him? A rowan branch for support. Ajuniper one to fight off dogs... and a bird cherry one to fight off snakes. Don't be afraid. Don't be afraid. Wash, daughter, wash. Today is your seventh day, it's bath day. Don't be angry with the snake that bit you. Olika, what is that song about? "Autumn" "Gentle" "Grass" Orika Pest! It's his fault. I called him. I wouldn't have fallen if we left together. He's still drinking at that wedding. Is that a real husband? Did the ravine devil rape you? Vuver? That's right, he did! That's right, he did! Bite me like your husband bites you. When my husband gets back, I'll tell him Vuver raped me! Come on! Here, here... and on the neck. Are you out of your mind? Hang in there, pal! That's what Vuver did to me! He hurt me. Here and here. Don't you leave me alone again! And you should cure me now! Dear God! I just hope I don't get pregnant by such a beast! Vuver! Vuver! I'll kill you! You tricked me! You tricked me! Pest! Onoshka So? No. Stop it. No. Don't undress me. Onoshka! Who's in there with you? Uncle Chemen, is that you? It's me. Do you need help? Who's in there with you? Are you crying? Uncle... I don't need anything. Don't tell Dad, ok? Leave, please. Isn't it a bit early for you? Uncle! Ok, I won't say anything. Please, go away! I'm going... Osylay Seryozha! Let's go home! Today is the last day you can visit your old home! Your wife and daughter are waiting. The table is set, they sent us for you. When they bring your father home, don't frown. And don't laugh. If you don't respect him, respect Death. There is nobody but us to host him on his 40th day. His parents are dead, and he never got another family. I know that already! What did he ever get for me after you kicked him out? Move over! That Pinocchio doll from Yaransk? Don't lie, Osylay. You saw a lot of good from your father, not just that toy. Let's go! Stand up! I was little, I was so happy to get it. I played with it. And you were at the table bawling. And sticking a screwdriver through Dad's face on your wedding picture. I was so scared when I saw that. I'll never forgive you! Or him! Osylay Sergeyevna! Come on, they'll be here any minute! I will laugh at Pavlik! I'll kill you! Sergey! Is my mother cold there? Do you mean Lucy? She was cold. A mole cricket gnawed through her coffin lid. Soil was pouring in. I fixed it for her yesterday. It's all done. She gave me a kiss. How's my husband, Izerga Gavrilov? Izerga found a lover, she's completely toothless. He now has nine beehives. They're a good couple. She has no teeth, and he's all covered in bee bites. And he quit smoking! What about you, did you quit? I will as soon as I get back there. Hi, Seryozha! Hi, Dad! Hi, Olya! Hi, Osylay! Look at Pavlik go! He started drinking at home in the morning. Sergey was like that too. God rest his soul. His best friend, Pavlik, is just like him. I cut my hair. I can't really see the difference. Marry me - and you'll see! I want to be with you, pal. This is actually a song. Oshanyai But I can't write music, I'm no composer. On the bank of the Urzhum stands the town with the same name with the windows of old homes it looks around itself, the dam roars under the bridge. I am no longer depressed. So many fields and woods around. It's beautiful and so nice. So let us celebrate and love our dear city of Urzhum! Let's decorate and have many guests and not drink vodka anymore. "Oshanyai". When I drive through Pumar, from or to Urzhum, I only think of Oshanyai. She's with her husband in Sernur. And I am living in Urzhum. Pumar is where we were born. It is between Sernur and Urzhum. We had a lot with Oshanyai, a lot of loving in Pumar. We never married, we broke apart, so be it. There is one thing I remember now, when I think of Pumar. Our very first time, I put her on a limestone, on bare stone. I didn't put anything under her, I didn't take off my shirt. I didn't notice my knees bleeding from the rough limestone we were on, stone covered in grit. Oshinay, light as a flower, hugging my head and my back. She said nothing. We got up and went home. And we kissed on the way. In the morning I found that spot. I sat and I cried. I stroked the limestone with one hand, and hit my forehead with the other. Our true love began on that day. As deep as eyes. She never complained about her hurt back, but she felt sorry for my knees. But I cannot bear it. I feel so sorry I can't breathe, I can't hear anything. I don't go to Pumar much, I don't need its groves. May the towels drop from its trees very soon. The best thing in my life is Oshinyai's gray stones. Forgive me, Oshanyai. That's all. I'll hit you with this pipe! Go, blow somewhere else! Otsvoen Stupid bitch! Go ahead, lazy girl. At least go up to the highway. You are a woman now, you should blow. You all go and blow. We did already. When the blood came, when we were brides. Blow again then. I don't want to embarrass myself. That's the way it should be. Or you won't have a husband. So be it. Why should I tell everyone what's going on in my underwear? Auntie! Auntie Marussia! Is it you, Otsvoen? Why are they making me do it!? Don't cry, little birch! You are a woman now, a bride! Don't be mad at anyone. The girl's pipe is to turn this day into a celebration. So you won't be afraid of the female fate. And the gods will save you.
