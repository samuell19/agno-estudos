TO LAURENE, HER MOTHER Let me read you what I put. "Her name is Jeanne. I'm broke." "Love her." - How's that? - Fine, but… What if she wakes up? Don't worry. I gave her half a sleeping pill. Come on. HER NAME IS JEANNE. I'M BROKE. LOVE HER. Michel? Michel! Hey, Grandma. Did the wind bring you here? Where are you going? There's nothing that way. What's that? Is it for me? "Her name is Jeanne." "I'm broke. Love her." We're here. Come on. I walked a lot. My legs hurt. But we're home! Come with me. Come on. I'm thirsty. Sorry. What's your name? Robinson Houla. I lost my suitcase and my things. I have nothing. Where did you lose it? I don't know. Don't you have any family? I don't know. Can I stay with you? Of course you can. As long as you want. Make me some elbow macaroni. With butter. Michel. Michel… The repo men… Michel. Michel. Eat before it gets cold. Michel… Robinson! What's that sleeping in the kitchen? What? What's that sleeping in the kitchen? - Grandma. - Whose grandma? A grandma. What's she doing here? She was abandoned. She doesn't have anyone. I don't want her here. Gaspard. Gaspard, don't be cruel. She doesn't have anyone! Her house was repossessed, she wanted to drown herself! He's dead. Twenty-five. Two! Twenty-six, twenty-seven. Twenty-eight. Almost missed that one! Twenty-nine. - Good. - Fire. Fire. - Fire. - Good. Good. They tossed her out like a used sock. - At the edge of the ditch. - Good. She was alone in the storm. With an envelope on her coat. Like an orphan on the steps of a church! I know, I know. Good. She's had cancer twice. In her breast and her knee. I get the picture! That's not all. - You have no idea what... - Enough! Good. - Good. - Good, too. - Fire. - Good. - Fire. - No, that one's good. It's good. Is there any wine? Just beer. The thigh. Gaspard's coming. Do something, anything. Wash a bowl! I took the chicken out, but there's a steak. No. - I'll do it. - No. Let me do it! - You've been working. Sit. - No. - I don't mind. - Let her. Why are you yelling at him? Sit down. Want some sauce? What's wrong? What'd you put in it? Oil, that's all. - Which oil? - That one. Lemon dish soap. She cooked my steak in dish soap. Don't go anywhere. Wait here. Don't go anywhere. 3 JOURNÉES STREET LOUIS BLANC STREET PASCAL STREET MARÉCHAL JUIN AVENUE RASPAIL STREET - Grandma! - They're going to hear it from me… - Pigs! - Grandma! - Grandma! - They're going to tow it! Come here! - What? - Come on! - They're towing Robinson's car! - It's fine! It's not his. He borrowed it. - Yes, but… - Come on. Do you know Jeanne Delmas St.? No. Why? It's named after me. - I was in the Resistance, so… - Don't give me your sob story. Robinson's friends always have a sob story. If you knew what I've been through… No, don't tell me anything! I've been down and out too. Your son ditched you. Robinson's mother left him. He's a foster kid. We were all abandoned. We can't look after you. Understand? I can still make myself useful. I can run a household. You had some bad luck, Grandma. We can't buy you medicine when you get sick. I never get sick. - Robinson, he... - Robinson! He's too nice. He's not realistic. You remind him of his unlucky life. If he could, he'd bring home every unfortunate soul in town. An ice cream. Thank you. Want an ice cream? I don't care. One Blue Sail special, please. HER NAME IS JEANNE. I'M BROKE. LOVE HER. Here. You're broke, but you're buying me ice cream. I bought it on credit. - Want to try? - No. - Go on, it's good! - No, I don't want to! I don't want to. - OK. - Where are you going? I'll be right back. I'm going to get my friend. I am. He has a car. I'll be right back. Don't move. Darkies are usually nice to old folks. Did you just call me "darkie"? Grandma! He didn't… Fuck! - Gaspard, listen... - No! I didn't run away from my family to have another one. Family is shit. It's just a bunch of problems. That's reality! That's why she was abandoned! - Where are you going? - To kick her out. - Don't be stupid! - Don't force a grandma on me! - Stop! - Let me go! Fuck off with your old bat! If you touch her, you'll regret it. Friends or not. Stop! Christ. Your identity problems, money problems, unhappiness… I'm sick of it! Too complicated. - Calm down. I'm sorry... - You forced this on me! You didn't ask what I thought! Here. Short, she stays. Long, she goes. This one. Short. She stays. That's it. When I say "top," put an X. Not now. When I say. Erase that. Top! - Did you put an X? - Yes. Top! Top! Top! Top! Top! Top! Will you buy me a dress? And maybe some overalls, if I help you out. And a bicycle. For my birthday. It's coming up. We don't have much money, you know. Top! We're fixing up the house with salvaged materials. Why? You're young. - Don't you have a job? - Sure I do. - Don't you have a career? - I do. We used to work at a lock factory. They shut down last year, so Gaspard and I… Top! We wound up unemployed. I'm all right, but Gaspard lost everything. He lost his wife, his house, his car, everything. Top! And he and Gina were kind of my family. Are you paying rent on the house? The bank might come… The house is ours, Grandma. Don't worry. We found it. It was in ruins. So we rebuilt it with our own money. Top! Top! GASPARD AND ROBINSON'S REFRESHMENTS Top! - How much is that? - Let me do the math. - How many Xs? - The ones up here are the dead. Where do the dead stop and the "tops" start? Is this a new way of doing math? Let me see. I told you to separate them with a little dash. Forget it. Just put 837 meters. - Why 837? - Approximately. Gaspard. You good? Yeah, I'm fine. What's wrong? GASPARD AND ROBINSON REFRESHMENTS ABOUT 837 METERS GRAND OPENING JULY 15TH Wow! This one's heavy. Oh, Christ! Go ahead. What are you doing? Don't be cute. - Hold the ladder. - No. Robinson, you're going to break a leg, for Christ's sake. You're an idiot. - Quick. It's heavy. - Yeah. Ever wonder why folks let their houses fall into ruin like that? That's a nice house. A lot must have gone on here. Yeah. They met by chance On Bastille Day Street He had a little room And they loved each other tenderly She brought him here. The first on January. This was her parents' house. Good people. Made a fortune with the sea. In 1944, they even hid Jews in the attic. They got married in church because… She wanted to wear white. Here's the bedroom. The bed. Right next to the window. They didn't have kids. They were never apart for ten years. Because he loved her more than anything. One night, she was… leaning near the window. Watching the snow fall. She said she was leaving him. She'd met someone. She was tired of being with a man out of work. He felt betrayed. And all his dreams… Screwed. Stop it, Gaspard. I don't like it when you're down like this. Don't rehash the past. We'll be all right. We'll open the bar. Right? Come on. Let's get out of this house. Come eat. I made gazpacho. I'm not hungry. Are you all right, Gaspard? You're not going to do anything stupid. Go have dinner with your girlfriend. Gina! Gina! Cover up before you catch cold. He's crying like a baby now. He put Gina's music on. That's not a good sign. Go inside. - Are you crying? - Leave me alone. Stop crying. It makes me feel bad. My life is meaningless. I'm giving it all up. I'm marrying Grandma. Want to party? Eh? There's no beer left. I drank it all! - Why are you so down? - I don't know. It just happened. Gina! Leave me alone! Leave me alone! The usual, sir? Pastis? A little mozzarella? Oh, man. Marie-Louise didn't buy groceries? Hey! Marie-Louise brought a guy home. That's why she didn't buy groceries, they must have eaten out. I'm happy for her! Me too. - Should we go to the boss's house? - It's not Tuesday. They'll be home. You OK, Gaspard? Stop asking me that! Should we borrow the Cadillac? Go! - Stop kissing me! - I love you, Gaspard. They're beautiful. Sleeping like angels. Shh! Christ! - Don't make me laugh. - I'm trying. We have to eat it all. We have to be quiet. These are leftovers. - Leftovers! - Quiet! Leftovers! The grandmother. Grandma! - Grandma! - Michel, what's going on? - Look, it's for you. - Oh… What's this? - And shoes, too. - Oh… You shouldn't have. It's because we love you. - What's wrong? - It doesn't look good on me. Sure it does. - I think you look very pretty. - No, look. And the color doesn't suit me. Gaspard. She doesn't like the color. I told you it doesn't go with her hair. What do you think? I think it looks very good. - Really? - Yes. Then I'll keep it, if you like it. Do you like sunrises or sunsets more? The sunrise. It's sweeter. I like dawn more, too. The day my mother went off with her Norwegian, it was dusk. She had a suitcase. She was walking away, looking back. Her Norwegian was pulling her arm. She was waving goodbye to me. Ever since I was a kid, I always thought that… people who don't love each other left each other at sunset. If I die before you, I want to be buried in a mass grave. - Even if we get rich someday. - Don't talk like that. Grandma. Grandma. Come sleep inside. - It's cold out here. - Yeah. Hey, Africans! Good morning, Spaniards! Hi, Italians! Good morning, Moroccans! Good morning, everyone over there on the other side! Hey there in Marseilles! Hey, everyone! Hey, all the Vaucluse women! Hi, Grandma! Good morning, bees! Good morning, my yard and my house! Good morning, my bed! Good morning, Gaspard. Good morning, Robinson. - Does that hurt? - No. Robinson! Hello! Give me a kiss. - Yeah? - Help me out here. Robinson! Hello! - Yeah? - Can we do the truck? When Gaspard takes his nap. Shit, she bit me! Robinson! - Yeah? - Come here! Get this goose out of here. She bit me. She's hysterical. And she shits everywhere! Get rid of her! - Christ, chickens… - Come here. - Easy. - Easy. Easy. Look, you scared her. - What is it? - The chickens. I have to move out. Come here. Look, she shit everywhere. - You're scaring her. Stop! - Get her out! Get rid of it. I hate them. Look at this. Who's going to clean this up? There's another one. - Stop. - Get out, chicken! - I'm sick of this! - Wait! - Why did you bring them? - I'll take her. I brought them in because of the fox. Here we go. Look, you're scaring them. Stop! Below the Mirabeau bridge There flows the Seine As for our love, must I recall how then After each sorrow joy would come again This fly! Let night come toll hours away Days go by me here I stay Let us stay hand in hand and face to face Got it. Mm… Not too fast, Grandma! Here. Here! Go, Grandma! Go! Yeah, Grandma! Oh, the ball! Let's go play. OK? That's a woman living alone. How do you know? How do I know? I can just tell. Maybe she's got a guy at home. Maybe he's sick, or paralyzed. Who knows? No way. She's thin. She must not eat every day. Maybe her eyesight's bad. Maybe she doesn't have parents. Maybe she's an orphan. Robinson, that's enough, OK? - Stop. - What? Oh, give her some flowers! Give her flowers. Stay there, OK? - Go on. - I can't. - Buy her a drink. - I've never hit on a girl. Buy her a drink. Show her what you're like. You look great. My jacket is good luck. - I don't want to. - Go on, it's not that hard! - OK, OK! - Go! Guapa! How are you? Sir? Sir? Sir? FALLEN ON HARD TIMES. THANK YOU Thank you. - Thank you. - No, thank you. Sir? So? - Well? - I gave her some money. Why'd you do that? She needed help. I told you… I could feel it. No way! You bring home an old lady and fall in love with a beggar. You're like a magnet. That was the money for the nails! We're broken. Yeah, but… It's fine, we can keep eating at Marie-Louise's place. Marie-Louise is on a diet now. It's all over. Give me my jacket. Where are you going? Hey! Don't sit there! Very nice! - Want to put it all out to see? - Sure. Hey! - Where's the girl who lived here? - No idea! That's nice. Is it a bird? No. It's a kite. Know how to fly it? - What's your sister's name? - I don't have a sister. Who's the lady with you? That's my mom. Her name's Rose. - Don't you go to school? - No. My mom won't let me. What's your name? She's living in a greenhouse. With her daughter. Can you imagine? She must be in deep shit. You wouldn't think so, but I know. Look, Robinson, I don't want any widows or orphans at the house. You brought home a rooster, a hysterical goose, a half-crazy grandma… enough is enough! - I didn't say anything. - I know you. You're like a priest. I'm sick of you calling me a priest. We're opening a bar, Robinson, not the Salvation Army. Sorry, but I can't just turn a blind eye. - It's just how I am. - Why are you doing this to me? - It's not all your responsibility! - Do what to you? This misery was there before you, and it'll be there after! - We can do something about it. - Go ask the baker, then. This concerns me. He makes the bread. You've got nothing. Half a house! This concerns you, does it? I was wrong to go into business with you. Every vagabond who walks by our place, you'll give them all our fries. Christ… It's funny, listening to you. You don't know what it's like to be 12 and alone, no place to sleep… You've never slept on a bench or spent three days freezing your nuts off! When your wife left you, I brought you home. It's true. You don't know what it's like to be alone at night, seeing lights in the windows, doors closed, gates locked, refrigerators locked, restaurants and patios locked up! Everyone dining out on the patios, that's all closed off to me! I don't care about your fries! I don't give a shit! What was that? Go cry me a river, OK? I'm sick of hearing about this. - OK? - Asshole. Oh, hey, ginger boy! You don't know what it's like, family dinners at Christmas, being forced to eat when you're not hungry. When I was kid, I hated Fridays. That was beef-and-potato casserole day. I hated beef-and-potato casserole. I had to bathe three times a day. I loved gypsy kids, they were so dirty. With their torn clothes. They were free! I had to get up at the crack of dawn to say good morning. Go to school with a backpack full of books every day, all for what? You tell me. Hey! So I'm sick of hearing about how hard your life has been. There's the truck. Fuck you! And fuck the truck. Fuck all of you! Robinson! Come on, Robinson! - Robinson! - Shut up! Hello! Robinson! Where are you going? I'm going that way. I'm walking! Take your socks off. Come on. Hurry up. I'm thirsty. Hurry up! - Hurry. - Quiet.

Come on. It's so nice! Come on! Go see Robinson. - Come with me. - Yes! See? If you let the line out, it goes into the sky. - Should we send it to the sky? - Yes! Above the clouds! See? The kite! It's so nice! - You can borrow it. - Yes. - Want to play with it while we eat? - Yes. - Hold on, OK? - OK. - You're sure? - Yes. Cakes. Bread. Sausage. OK. A leek. Green beans. Don't let go. Don't let go of the kite! Cheese. - Want some honey? - No. It's good like this. Look. You got it everywhere. Let's go. We're late. - What do we do with this? - Leave it. It's a shame to leave all this. Yeah. If you know anyone who wants it, they can have it. - I'm leaving it. - They can take it! Yeah, OK! Keep the kite, too! It's yours! - What's up? - Get out, I need the truck. What, I have to do everything? What'd you do with the food? Give it to the poor? - Father Robinson? - We ate it! Tell your girlfriend not to treat me like an idiot. - Where are you going? - I'm sick of her. Sick of her! He's going to get drunk again. And cry like a baby. Olé! What are you doing here? Eh? What are you doing here? Mommy's sick! Where's your mommy? - At my house. - Where? - Where is... - Over there. Come on. A doctor's on the way. I don't want to go to the hospital. Don't worry. I'm here. They'll take my daughter. I'll look after your daughter. Robinson, wake up. Wake up. - Robinson! Wake up! The night I just had… - What? Something happened to Rose. I brought her daughter home. You were at Rose's? I wasn't at her place. Get up! She needs you. Remember Grandma? We flew the kite with you. Remember the kite? Don't you remember? - Do you? - No. Your mommy's going to come back. She'll come back. - Your mama's coming. - She'll come back. - My little sweetie… - Mommy's coming back. Oh… Don't cry, sweetie. You'll make Gaspard cry. - Don't cry. - Want some? Make her some breakfast. Want some breakfast? Are you hungry? Give me a kiss. OK? - You all right? - Yeah. - And Eve? - She's at our place. Do you know when you get out? I must have caused you a lot of trouble. I'm sorry. No, no. The doctor asked me for your address. I gave him ours. I don't feel well, Gaspard. It's the smell of the ether. I feel sick. Ma'am? Here. - What does she have? - Endocarditis. - Is it serious? - No, not at all. It's just something with her heart. The doctor said it was nothing. Come on. I swear, she'll be fine. She gives off something… so pure. Yeah, yeah. Are you coming? Come on! Here. You OK, Grandma? - Pardon? - No, nothing. Can you cut the hairband for me please? Hang on, let me finish this first. OK… Show me. Who's this doll? What's her name? Huh? Let's call her… What should we name her? - Missouquette? - Nah! - Let's name her "Boucleline." - Say that again? - Boucleline! - Boucleline? Where's your dad? He's dead. Here. There you go. Thank you. OK. I'm going back to work. I'll leave you with Boucleline. Screwdriver. Pliers. Hammer. Nothing on TV this afternoon? There! ATELIERS STREET JEANNE DELMAS STREET Give me the cake.

Give me your hands. The wheel! Yoo-hoo! Up we go! Want me to throw you? No! You alright? Gaspard. You all right? Yeah. Are you sure? Yeah, Grandma, I'm fine. FOR SALE Hey, Gaspard. The salt's done a real number on your truck. It's rusted. - You're not scamming me? - It's been in the garage for years. So? - I'll take it. - Yeah? To Robinson, Grandma, Eve, and Rose: Someday I'll stop by for a pastis and a slice of mozzarella at your bar. Gaspard. LICENSE Gaspard! Gaspard! Gaspard! Stay here. What's wrong with Robinson?
