The pilgrims this year are nice people. Am I not right? - Yes. We'll definitely get enough tips to last us a year. Almonds, walnuts, dates, onions.. Please accept these, Maharaj. I'll accept it, Mr. Govinda Das. This pilgrimage could be possible only because of you. No. No, Maharaj. What are you saying? I lived in Kolkata for many years. Bengali ascetics are very nice people. You should carry all kinds of necessary things with you. When you get tired walking in the desert sands eat an onion. You won't feel thirsty. Please don't refuse me, Maharaj. I've arranged a separate camel for Goddess Kali. Don't worry that he is going there for the first time. You're sending him with me. I'll take good care of him. Why are you crying again? Swamiji, please come and try to convince her. Atheistic! How dare you touch a Brahmin? Brahmin? So what if you're a Brahmin? Enough of your lectures. This is our place. If you come here again, we will.. Please come, Panditji. Come. I've lost my religion. These low caste people have touched me. Swamiji, when will we leave this place? As soon as Gul Mohammad finish packing the luggage. Why are you roaming about? Nothing matters to you. You interact and eat with everybody. I don't understand what kind of ascetic you are. Where are they going? - I don't know. Maybe on some pilgrimage. Come on, let's join them. - Have you gone mad? There's a new girl here. Come with me. Leave me. - Hey! Don't dare to touch her. I'll kill you. So, you want to kill me, man? Scoundrel! Rogue! He was trying to act smart with me. I can't stay here. I can't stay here under any circumstance. Listen.. we'll set out tomorrow morning. We'll be able to join the pilgrims if we set out early tomorrow morning. Don't cry. Don't cry. I'm helpless. The people here are so ill-mannered. They won't let us live peacefully. People who won't be able to bear the difficulties of the journey.. ..can go back. We'll have to walk on the hot desert sands for days. You'll have very less food to satiate your intense hunger. You won't even get a shelter to rest at night. You must vow that you won't share your water with anyone. Not even with your spouse or with your parents or child. You'll lead the life of and ascetic from today. All of you are Brahmachari (celibate) now. Don't think about anything. Help each other. When Vishnu's Sudarshan chakra cut Goddess Sati's body.. ..into parts and scattered them, Sati's head fell in Hinlaj. So, Hinlaj is considered the most holiest.. ..of all the 51 holy shrines of the goddess. The goddess resides here. For ages men and women have undertaken this difficult journey.. ..to behold and seek the blessings of Goddess Hinlaj. When Sri Ram Chandra killed Ravan and committed the sin of murder.. ..he went to seek the blessings of Goddess Hinlaj to get rid of this sin. If you repent before Goddess Hinlaj and confess your sins.. ..the goddess will free you from the most heinous sins committed. Start praying and make your offerings. We'll start the journey at the auspicious time. Swamiji.. Do you want to say something, Popat Lal. No.. no.. nothing. You're and ascetic. I appoint you the head of this group. I've two sons. Mother has already met Sukhlal. Sukhlal and Ruplal will be the stick-bearer. Sukhlal. Ruplal. Bring the sticks here. Coming, father. Sukhlal, carry the stick. I'll soon be there. I've aged. I don't have the strength to endure the difficult journey. So, I'm sending my sons with you. Where is your elder brother? - He's coming. This is the stick of Hinlaj Mata. We've made it out of a branch of a tree from Hinlaj. Stop where he rests the stick. Resume the journey when he picks up the stick. You must offer food to the stick every day. "My heart sways, my body sways.." "..I've lost peace of mind." He's Ruplal, the charidar (stick-bearer). I've appointed him as the leader of the group. Discuss everything with him and then take a decision. Don't worry. I'll handle everything well. Charidar (stick-bearer)! - Coming. Take rest for some time. I'll check the other arrangements. The ages of both the stick bearers won't add up to 30. We've to depend on them for the journey. You only noticed their age. Did you notice how they do their hair and sing Hindi film songs? Let's leave everything to Goddess Hinlaj. Let's have faith in them and start the journey. I can't allow this small boy to walk. He'll sit on the camel with me. - Okay. Okay. No. No. I'm a man. I won't ride the camel. I'll walk like others. Glory to Goddess Hinlaj! - Glory to her. Glory to Goddess Hinlaj! - Glory to her. What happened? Why did you stop? What's wrong? What happened? What happened? Why did you stop? What happened? Why did everyone stop suddenly? I'll go and check. Shall I go ahead and see? - No. Don't do that. They may be robbers or thieves. Let's go back. Let's go back. Where shall we escape, Panditji? if they're robbers they'll attack us. I'm of the same opinion. Let's go ahead. - Okay. Mohammad, wait here. Who are you? Do you want to have tea? - What? You're in a group and yet you're scared? We're not scared. Why should we be scared of anything? Yet we should be careful. Sit down. Have tea. I'm very pleased to meet you. Have tea. Did you see what that fraud is doing? He's drinking tea with the non-Hindu men. I know that irreligious men like him will be born in Kalyug (age of vices). It's better to stay away from them. Let's move. - Where will you go? Who will guide you? The camel-man and stick-bearer, everybody is drinking tea with them. Shut up! I'm worried about keeping my religion intact and going back safely. He's interfering in everything. Stick-bearer, will you go or should we've to wait for you? Coming, Mr. Jay Shankar. Thanks a lot, brothers. We'll leave now. We'll meet again. - Of course. Of course. Bye, brother. We'll rest here today and set out early in the morning when it's cold. We'll reach Sunderi by afternoon. - Okay. Put down the stick. Just chanting the shlokas isn't enough. The religious scripture mention that.. ..we must practice religion with our better-half. But guruji.. - Don't you see me? I have children and grand children at home. After your guruma renounced family life I had to marry again for them. Dil Mohammad, come back today. - Yes. Don't go too far away. Where will he take the camels? There are cactus plants near the roads that we just crossed. He'll go there. Leave right now. Don't delay. Oh no! The water is very salty. We can't use this water. I had to carry my water-pot together with your sack. Quiet. - What? Quiet. - Shut up! I maybe your friend.. - Yes. ..but I'm not your porter. - Of course. Carry your sack. What's wrong? Why are you shouting early in the morning? You can only complain. The water is so salty. I felt uneasy the moment I drank it. Look, I'll be your porter but I'll be at peace only after.. ..I quench my thirst with water from your pot. Mohandas, go and stop him. The wells here are placed far away. If he wastes water he'll die of thirst. Brother Chiranjilal. Brother Chiranjilal. Seikhji! Seikhji! - Yes, Maharaj. Oh Allah! Come with me, Maharaj. Walk carefully, master. Let's go and help them. Bring them here. Move. Move aside. Let them breathe. A woman? How did a woman come here? Move. Move aside. - Mother! I'm here. You don't have to worry about me. Go and check the girl. Where are you going? I'll be back soon. - Please take care of the girl. Swamiji, let's take the girl inside. Inside? Why? What? What did you say? Don't waste time, bring her inside. The water isn't enough. Tell them to bring 2-3 buckets of water. Shankar, I want water. Has he regained consciousness? - No. Sukhlal, light a fire. We've to give tea to them. Seikhji! Brother Mohammad, please listen to me. No! No! this is impossible. Scoundrels Rogues! Oh Allah! No.. she hasn't regained her consciousness yet. Do you see what has happened, Bhairavi? Humans have treated her inhumanely. But even in her state of unconsciousness.. ..she's stretching out her hands to humans for help. Poor girl! She's a young girl. We're in a foreign country. We've a difficult journey ahead. What shall we do with her, Swamiji? I don't have any answer. We're going to our Mother Goddess in quest of peace. She has brought them here. They're also in search of peace. "Salutations to the divine mother who removes distress.." "..of those who you approach you and take refuge in you." "Please be gracious, Mother of the entire universe." "Please be gracious, Goddess of the world. Protect the world." "You're the goddess of all the moving and non-moving beings." Bhairavi, Mother appears before us in different forms. This tortured girl is a part of the same goddess. Maharaj.. - Yes. No.. she hasn't regained her consciousness yet. But, she's better now. What about the boy? He was beaten so badly that it's really miraculous that.. ..he escaped without a fracture. He had opened his eyes once but then again lost consciousness. Maharaj, what are your plans for today? Everybody wants to know. We can't start under the present circumstances. You're right. Popat, I suggest that we stay back here today and start tomorrow evening. Yes. That'll be better. What shall we do about the water problem? The water from the well is not fit for drinking. Don't worry about water. If we start early in the morning with Dil Mohamamd.. ..every person can get two pots of water from the river. It's not too far away, around two and half miles. But they've to walk a long distance in the desert. Who will agree to go? Why, Maharaj? Everybody will go. I'm ready to go. I've walked such a long distance.. shut up.. ..carrying such heavy luggage. Why can't I bring two pots of water? Don't worry, Maharaj. Don't worry. Okay. Has Dil Mohammad come back? - Yes, Maharaj. I found their belongings besides the river. Belongings? - Yes. The musical instruments, sari, scarves, anklets.. All these things. Dil Mohammad, keep them carefully. Mother.. mother.. who? Kunti.. where is Kunti? Where is my Kunti? Kunti! Who.. who are you? Who are you? Where's my Kunti? Where's my Kunti? She is with us. She's fine. - She's fine? Robbers! Rogues! You've come to snatch Kunti from me. Don't you've a mother and sister at home? Don't you feel ashamed? Why just three of you? Come one by one. Let me see how strong you are. Run away, Kunti. Run away. Run away. I couldn't save you, Kunti. I couldn't save you. I couldn't save you even after coming to the desert. Run away. - You've saved Kunti. She's fine. Kunti is alive? - Yes. Kunti is alive? - Yes. But she couldn't save herself. She may be alive but I couldn't save her honor. She has suffered and went through a lot for me. I want to go to her. I want to go. Yes, you'll definitely go. You'll definitely go. But, go after some time. After some time? Later? Okay. "There are so many sins been committed in your world, Mother." "It's a curse." "Is there no respite?" "Lie wins over truth today." "There are so many sins been committed in your world, Mother." "It's a curse." "Is there no respite?" "Lie wins over truth today." "Where's Ayodhya? Where's Lord Ram?" "Where has the ideal times got lost?" "What has happened?" "What has happened?" "Humans have become like animals." "Appear on the land of pious and holy women like Sita and Savitri." "Bring an end to this abominable practice." "There are so many sins been committed in your world, Mother." "It's a curse." "Is there no respite?" "Lie wins over truth today." "Don't your strong hands have the power to end violence?" "Save the helpless souls of this world, Mother." "We seek shelter at your holy feet." "We'll complete this difficult journey." "There are so many sins been committed in your world, Mother." "It's a curse." "Is there no respite?" "Lie wins over truth today." Thirumal, hold me properly or you'll fall. Sir, the man who can't save his wife's honor should be left behind. No, brother. Don't say that. Let's go. I'm a sinner. I'm an unchaste woman. No, daughter. Don't think that way. No one is a sinner in the eyes of the goddess. No one is unchaste in her eyes. Dil Mohammad, how long? We'll have to walk for couple of hours more. Glory to Goddess Hinlaj! - Glory to her. Dil Mohamamd.. - Yes. ..take down the luggage and.. ..take the camels to drink water. - Okay. Are you feeling unwell? - No. Are you feeling unwell? - No. Dil Mohamamd, give me a bucket of water. Why don't you understand that this is for our well-being? I don't want this. I don't want anything that will separate me from you. Thirumal.. ..we've committed a grave sin and so we're in this condition. We don't get peace anywhere. It's a sin to be alive. Our love is a sin. - No. No. Don't say this, Kunti. Don't say this. Love can never be sin. Why do you forget the day when we held hands and set out? We've suffered a lot, yet our love kept us alive. Please don't send me away after coming close to me. We must live with them from today. We'll become ascetics like mother and Swamiji. We'll pray for peace at the feet of Goddess Hinlaj. Kunti.. Kunti.. - No. No. Leave me. I beg of you, please leave me. They'll take a tax of 1 rupee 14 annas from every person. They'll note down our name and address. Only then we'll get permission to leave this place. Maharaj has come back. What happened. Maharaj? Did you pay the tax? - No. The inspector didn't come to the court. He comes when he wishes. The guard told us that he comes thrice a week. He'll definitely come tomorrow. What a problem! If we got the permission today, we could've started out tomorrow. We lost a day because of the inspector. We lost another day because of Thirumal. We've no other option. The delay is not intentional. Where is Thirumal? He's fine now. We must enquire about them. He was here some time back. I'll go and check. Thirumal! Brother Thirumal! They're calling me. Promise me Kunti that you'll meet me again tonight. Promise me, Kunti. Promise me. No, we can't meet. I can't meet you. Thirumal! Brother Thirumal! Well, it's not a wise decision to take them along with us. We have no other option. We can't leave them alone in this foreign land. Come, son. Come. Sit next to me. I hope you're fine. How is your body ache? The body has got rest. He has no body ache now. How could you be so immature, son? Where were you going all alone in the desert? We're coming to join you. - Us? Yes. We were present in Karachi the day you left the place. It's okay.. you don't have to tell us anything if you find it difficult. No. No. I must say it even if I find it difficult. I don't know who my parents are. I wandered on the streets ever since I can remember. I grew up on the streets. I would wear anklets and dance. I would play the harmonium and sing on streets. I picked pockets. I was jailed. I was addicted to drugs and alcohol. I've done everything that rogues like me do. When I was wandering around in the villages of Rajputaan.. ..disguised as an astrologer.. ..I fell in trouble when I went to read the palms.. ..of a landlord's daughter. I met Kunti. Her husband went to abroad two years back. We didn't get any message from him. Please read her palms and tell something about him. Why are you staring at her face? Just reading the palms isn't enough. Face reading is also important. There are lots of problems. I can't tell you anything today. I'll come again later. I went to her house the next day. I saw her again. On the pretext of reading her palm I held her hands. This continued for days. We would keep staring at each other. We never felt the need to express our feelings. We conveyed it through our eyes. Then one night the rich man's daughter Kunti eloped with me.. ..only for the sake of love. Stop your nonsense. Why does the married woman decked in ornaments roam around with you? Get out from here or I'll call the guard. We wandered in many different places but didn't get a shelter. She was not my wife. So, she wasn't my legal life partner. We would travel from one village to another. I would play the harmonium while she danced. We earned a lot of money that way. Wonderful! Fantastic! They were not happy just with the dance. They wanted something more. Thirumal! I would get angry and fight with them. And would flee from there. We fled and finally reached Karachi. There too a man tried to molest Kunti. We thought of joining you. If we join you she can be safe at least for a month. Maharaj, I don't have anyone except her. No one loved me. No one came close to me. She is mine. But.. I couldn't save her honor. It's my mistake. My fault. My.. If I could get hold of them once.. Whom, Dil Mohamamd? The men who raped Kunti. The men with whom we had tea that day. Thirumal.. - Maharaj, please save me. Please save me. If Kunti doesn't meet me, if she doesn't talk to me.. ..if she renounces family life.. ..for whom shall I live? I've no one except her. I've nothing. Don't worry, Thirumal. I'll arrange everything. There's no one in this world who can keep your Kunti away from you. Don't touch me. - Why won't I touch you? What's wrong with you? - Nothing. I just want to forget you. - No. You can never forget me.. ..or you wouldn't have come at this hour to meet me. I've come to tell you the last time that.. ..the only way to repent for our sins is to become an ascetic. Wrong. They've misguided you. Please have mercy on me, Kunti. Please have mercy on me. Please forget everything that has happened. Let's go away from here. What are you saying? What are you saying? - I'm absolutely right. What relation do we have with them? They want to ruin our lives. Kunti, I promise that we'll settle down again. We'll enjoy and be happy like we used to be. - No. No. Kunti. - Don't touch me. I've vowed to mother that I won't touch you and talk to you. No. No. I can't let you go. How can I live without you? Leave me. Leave me. Where will I go without you? Where will I go? - Go wherever you wish to. Go away. Go away from here. Thirumal! Thirumal! Will Chadrakup Baba help us get rid of all the sins? Will he be cured? - Yes. He should be cured. If you confess your sins before Chadrakup Baba.. ..even if you confess sins like feticide and murder.. ..He'll forgive you. You can visit Mother Hinlaj after you're free from the sins. Shut up! Idiot! He keeps talking all the time. He is so disturbing. What are you saying? Please don't mind his words, Mr. Popat Lal. He has lost his sanity. He's mad. It's okay, sister. It's okay. Thirumal, let's go.. - Who are you? Who are you? Go away from here. - Thirumal! This is abominable. He has eloped with someone else's wife. Who'll else will lose sanity if he doesn't? Keep him here. Keep him here. Let him die here. What are you saying, Jay Shankar? Your frequent visits to the forests is abominable. It didn't happen because of them. Come on, move. Why? Do you want to hit me? He thinks he's too smart. Sister, please convince him to come, I'll go ahead. Water. Why are you behaving this way? What shall we do if they leave us and go? Do you hear me? Come. Let's go. I'm worried about Mr. Jay Shankar. Stomach upset isn't a good sign. He'll soon be back. Where shall we rest tonight? We'll stop near the stone ahead. Let me go and discuss the matter with Maharaj. Gokul Das, brother Gokul Das.. - What is it? I was saying that.. You're going to land me in trouble. We'll be in trouble if they find out. You fool! Let's do it secretly. - Secretly? Okay. No one should find out. Do you get me? - Okay. So, I would suggest that since we're getting late for Mr. Jay Shankar.. ..let's take the route over the mountains. Even if we have to stop on the way, we'll reach before the camels. Why don't all of us take the route over the hills? The camels won't be able to walk on the hills. Seikhji knows the way. They'll reach on time. - Oh! Then I'll have to take the long route with Bhairavi. Ruplal, send Dil Mohammad. - Okay. Mr. Popatlal, come with me. It won't be wise to walk over the hills with Thirumal at night. You're right . Kunti, leave Thirumal with me and come with me. You must be tired dragging him along. Thirumal, come with me. Let's go. Stick-bearer. Let's go. Glory to Goddess Hinlaj. - Glory to her. Glory to Goddess Hinlaj. - Glory to her. Glory to Goddess Hinlaj. - Glory to her. Maharaj.. we're sinners. Pilgrimage is not meant for us. He has become mad as we tried to go on a pilgrimage. Isn't it? Let's go, daughter. The camels have gone ahead. Let's go. Who is there? Stop! Why don't you answer me? Answer me. Who are you? Sister, take care of Thirumal. No, Mr. Popatlal. Beware! Thirumal! - Thirumal! Thirumal! - Thirumal! Thirumal! Thirumal! Allah! My son! My child! Thank god. Thirumal! Thirumal! Kunti.. Kunti.. these men have killed the men who raped you. They've killed them. Look. Thirumal! You're cured now. You've played the old tune. I know that you're cured, Thirumal. Thirumal, I know that you're cured. I'm cured? Why? What has happened to me? - Nothing. Nothing had happened. Nothing. Kunti.. something went wrong. Where are we going? Goddess Hinlaj will set everything right. We're going to behold her. Karachi.. or the land of rogues.. Desert.. and after that.. ..after that everything was engulfed in darkness. There's no darkness now. There won't be any darkness around us. By the grace of the Goddess we'll find light again. Let's go. Hey Dil Mohamamd! Hey Naseruddin! Where were you? Why? Am I your servant that I'll always be at your service? I was sleeping in my room. Where's my roti (Indian bread)? - Roti? - Yes, roti. I got the information this morning that there are 30 people in your group. I owe you thirty rotis. Brother, there is no wood or bushes around. Even the camels didn't eat anything throughout the day. How can we have rotis with us? I don't want to hear any excuse. I want my share of rotis. Brother, don't be angry. - Leave me. I know your tactics. You can go only after you give me rotis. What are you saying? How can we give you rotis when we didn't even make them? Please accept same money, Naseeruddin. Great! Well-said. Do you think I can eat money? Don't trouble us. We'll give you flour, make rotis for yourself. How will I make rotis here? How will I light fire? There are no logs around. God hasn't blessed this place with rain. You won't get water here. All the bushes have dried up. There's nothing to cook rotis here. How will I survive? I didn't eat rotis for a long time. I didn't eat rotis for a long time. No! I owe 30 rotis. You must give me 30 rotis. Didn't you know that you've to give me food when you took water from here? Scoundrels! - Shut up! Don't threaten me. Bhairavi, give my bag. What are you doing, stick-bearer? - Leave me. Leave me, Mr. Popatlal. I went to Hinlaj with pilgrims five times. How dare he insult me? Dil Mohamamd.. - Maharaj.. Maharaj, this old man has insulted me. Brother, we couldn't make rotis today. We didn't eat anything yet. Take nuts and dates. - Give me. Give me. You didn't give me the rotis I deserve. Give me the nuts and dates. Gokul das, walk slowly. I'll be back soon. No one should find out. - It won't help. It won't help? What do you mean? There's no meaning to it. What are you staring at? I may have had extra to reduce the weight of the sacks. What? How dare you? Why are you fighting? How dare he beat me? Selfish man! Do you know.. - Beware! If you say anything I'll beat you. How dare you beat me? I'll tell them. I'll definitely tell them. Listen to me. Listen to me, stick-bearer. He had brought food in the sack. He ate them secretly. I shared it with you. - Yes, it was the wage you paid me for carrying it. Wages for carrying it? I was hungry so I ate it. - Okay. Brother.. - Okay. I'll teach you a lesson. I'll teach you a lesson. If we have raw flour with jaggery it upsets the stomach. Isn't it? You're very hungry. Right? Do you want to eat dates? No. I was just asking. I'm a man. I don't get hungry so easily. No! Shame on you. the ascetic will hear us. I don't care if he does. Why are you behaving immaturely? Go with them. I've vowed in the name of Goddess Hinlaj. You've pledged in the name of Goddess Hinlaj? A storm is razing. A storm. Get down. Get down. Maharaj.. What's it, Dil Mohamamd? - We must leave now. Okay. Let's go. Madam? - I'll call her. Bhairavi. Bhairavi. - Thirumal! "Mother. Mother." "Mother. Mother." "Mother. Mother." "Mother. Mother." "Mother. Mother." "Mother, when will the travails of our journey end.." "..and when will we find peace under your affectionate shelter? "Tell us, mother." "Mother, when will the travails of our journey end.." "..and when will we find peace under your affectionate shelter?" "How far is it? How far?" "Tell us, mother." "How far is it? How far?" "Mother, when will the travails of our journey end.." "..and when will we find peace under your affectionate shelter?" "How far is it? How far?" "Tell us, mother." "We don't fear darkness." "We know that we'll get shelter at your feet." "We don't fear darkness." "We know that we'll get shelter at your feet." "If thorns prick our feet on the way, we'll smilingly bear it." "How far is it? How far?" "Mother, when will the travails of our journey end.." "..and when will we find peace under your affectionate shelter?" "How far is it? How far?" "Tell us, mother." "The homeless wayward love finds an address at your benevolent feet." "The homeless wayward love finds an address at your benevolent feet." "If a tempest razes, we'll face it bravely." "How far is it? How far?" "Mother, when will the travails of our journey end.." "..and when will we find peace under your affectionate shelter?" "How far is it? How far?" "Tell us, mother." "You make us suffer a lot, Mother." "But finally you give us shelter." "You make us suffer a lot, Mother." "But finally you give us shelter." "You're our guiding light in this darkness." "How can we forget you?" "How far is it? How far?" "Mother, when will the travails of our journey end.." "..and when will we find peace under your affectionate shelter?" "How far is it? How far?" "Tell us, mother." "How far is it? How far?" "Tell us, mother." "How far is it? How far?" "Tell us, mother." "How far is it? How far?" It's been more than 24 hours. We haven't eaten anything. What shall we do, Sheikh ji? - God knows. Even the camels didn't eat anything. We must keep walking till tomorrow. Only then we can reach Chadrakup. She'll collapse soon. Send her to me. Sheikhji, won't we find shade where we can stay tomorrow? Yes, we may find shade there. - Oh! Unholy. This is unholy. There's darkness everywhere. God, save me. Protect me. Swamiji, what shall we do now? Mr. Jay Shankar is.. - Mother will take care of everything. Let's go. - Let's go. Sheikhji, it's difficult to walk anymore. The well is far away. All of us will die if we stop here. We can't walk anymore. Stick-bearer! Stick-bearer! - What happened? What happened, Sundarlal? You've to stop now. We can't halt here. - Why did you stop here? Will you be able to save Mr. Jay Shankar if you stop here? Please try to convince them. We'll reach the well if we walk for few hours. We must reach there anyhow. Don't stand silently, brother. Have faith and keep moving ahead. By the grace of Chandrakup Baba and Mother Hinklaj.. ..we'll rest for a day after we reach the well. Panditji will definitely get well. Jay Shankar, will you drink water? Brothers, I know it's very difficult and tiring.. ..yet we've to carry him. I've supported him till now, but I can't anymore. Isn't there anyone amongst us who can carry Mr. Jay Shankar.. ..and save our lives? Okay. Since we must go ahead.. ..let's take Mother's name and carry on with the journey. Tie Mr. Jay Shankar to my back. I'll carry him. - Stop! Tie him to my back. Let me carry him for some distance.. - No. I can manage. If I tied a child to my back and begged I would've got food. But.. - Don't waste time, do as I say. Do you think the ascetic can carry him? Come on, do it. Don't delay. Seikhji, how long will it take us to reach the well? The boy will collapse. Oh Allah! It'll take us about an hour. Let Mr. Jay Shankar ride the camel in my place, mother. He has been carrying him on his back for a long time. No. No, madam. Tell him to stop the camel. What happened? What happened? What are you saying? What? Let me see. Get water for him. Get water for him. He did a long time back. His hands had become stiff and held Thirumal tightly. Thirumal! Thirumal! Thirumal. Thirumal. Thirumal. Thirumal. Thirumal! Thirumal! Thirumal! Go away. Go away. I've carried a dead body on my back. I've carried a dead body on my back. I'm helping people. I'm helping people. Friend, I couldn't take you back to your country. God has called you. By his grace you'll always be at peace. But, I'll always regret this. Your near and dear ones are far away from you. Your wife is waiting for you at home. But, you couldn't go back. You always rituals and customs. But, we couldn't cremate you as per rituals. The sky is a witness. The wind is a witness. The sands of the desert are witness. We did whatever we could. We're forced to leave our co-traveler behind. I pray hat Goddess Hinlaj forgives us. Thirumal, we're leaving. Let's go. Thirumal, what's wrong with you? Come. Go. Go. I won't go with you. You won't go with us? Do you think I don't understand anything? You made me carry a corpse.. ..you made me mad so that you can escape with Kunti. Isn't it? What nonsense? All of you are dacoits. All of you are scoundrels. Kunti is mine do you get me? Kunti is mine. What's wrong with you, Thirumal? What has happened to you again? Kunti, let's go from here. Come on. What are you doing? Leave me. Let's run. - Leave me. Catch him. Thirumal! Leave me. Leave me. What are you doing? Leave me. What are you doing? Leave me. Leave me. Thirumal. - Thirumal. Leave her. Leave her. Thirumal.. What are you doing? Leave me. All these dacoits have snatched my wife from me. Okay. I'll go alone. Where will you go, my friend? What did you say? Friend? I'm your friend? He called me his friend. - Yes. Okay. Okay. Since you're my friend, I'll tell you secretly. I'll go to Karachi. - Karachi? How strange? I'll also go to Karachi. We can go there together. Let's go. Oh! So, you don't believe me? No. No. Since you're my friend, I trust you. Let's go. Let's go. They'll take the camel through the other route. Let's go, sister. - No, I won't go. Leave us here. No, daughter. Don't be so impatient. You're going to the Goddess. She has inflicted the sufferings to purge and purify you. How much more will she make us suffer? What kind of Mother is she? She snatched away his sanity again after returning it. Why? What's our mistake? Is love a mistake? Is love a sin? Come on, answer me. You're and ascetic. You're an ascetic. Please tell me what our fault is. Sister, let's go. They've moved ahead. Seikhji! Seikhji! Oh Allah! Is he a human? He's the owner of the wells here. He's a rich man. He doesn't live here. His servants work for him here. We're lucky that he's here right now. Dil Mohammad! - Mr. Khan, you're here? Such a voice in such a huge body? Greetings. - Greetings. How are you? We're meeting after a long time. Maharaj, you'll get shelter here and water from the waterfall on the other side. Take rest today. You can resume the journey tomorrow morning. I'll leave now. Will you come in the evening? Bring Naseeruddin with you. We'll sing and dance. - is it? Great! Great! I'll come. I'll definitely come. Goodbye. - Goodbye. "You guide us." "You're beauty personified." "Beholding you is worshipping you." "Beholding you is worshipping you." "Your memories keep me alive." "Beholding you is worshipping you." "Your memories keep me alive." "Beholding you is worshipping you." "It's right that I'm angry but I'm your devotee." "It's right that I'm angry but 'm your devotee." "If you accept me.." "If you accept me.." "I'll dedicate myself to your service." "If you accept me.." "I'll dedicate myself to your service." "If you accept me.." "Why won't I surrender before you?" "Your land is my world." "You don't lack in anything." "Your land is my world." "You don't lack in anything." "Your land is my world." "If I've to pray before you.." "I shed tears as I mediate about you." "It's my prayer." "It's my prayer." "It's my prayer." "It's my prayer." "It's my prayer." "It's my prayer." Fantastic! Fantastic! You've given us immense joy. I'll never forget this day. It's the grace of god. Okay. Goodbye. Go to sleep now. We'll start early tomorrow morning. Who is it? No! Who is it? Where? Who is it? There he is. He's trying to escape. Hit him. Hit him. Hit him. Hit him. What are you doing? What are you doing? Who are you chasing? I've killed.. I've killed my Kunti. You want to snatch my Kunti from me, you scoundrels. Sinners! I've killed her. Please carry the girl to the camel. Are you going to start now? - Yes. Why don't we wait for some time? He must be hiding somewhere up there. He can't come down as he's scared of us. We've waited long for him. It's better if he doesn't come. What are you saying, Bhairavi? Yes, I'm right. He might strangulate and kill the girl. I don't have any feelings for him anymore. - Bhairavi.. Ruplal.. Popat Lal. Thirumal! Thirumal! Thirumal! Thirumal! Why are you unnecessarily troubling yourself? Thirumal will definitely come down to drink water when he's thirsty. He'll catch him and send him to us. Dil Mohammad, don't waste time. Let's go. Let's go. Maharaj, won't I ever get him back? Won't he come back? - He'll come. He'll come. He comes back despite being hurt in love. But he is insane. What if he loses his way? We lose our way. His path is simple and straightforward. So, he never loses his way. He never loses his way. I hope his words come true, Baba Chandrakup. Please send him back to me. Please send him back to me. We'll reach Chandrakup after we take the turn ahead. Glory to Baba Chadrakup Swami. - Glory to Him. Chandrakup.. Oh god! Goddess Hinlaj, I pray that I reach Chandrakup. For twelve years.. I've spent each day and night.. ..in the last twelve years waiting for this moment. I've been waiting for this day. Glory to Baba Chandrakup. Please allow me to repent for my sins. Have mercy on me. I pray I'm in my senses when I reach there. Swamiji Maharaj.. Do you want to say something to me? Yes. Who is the lady who has come with you? She is not related to me. You've come to this far flung place to get rid of your sins. Why did you bring that trouble along with you? I don't remember any sin I've committed.. ..to get rid of which I've come so far. I was born out of the womb of one such woman. So what's the problem if she comes with us? I wish I could reason like you. I've been carrying a heavy burden of sins. Swamiji Maharaj, please forgive me. I shouldn't have asked you this question. Mother is a goddess. She is different. But I consider womankind more dangerous than snakes. My brother lived in Delhi at that time. He died all of a sudden. Father brought sister-in-law to our home. Since that day problems have been a part of my life. They can be very deceptive. They know how to control men. When I realized my life was already ruined. I had no option to retreat. But I had to save the reputation of my family. That night.. it was raining heavily. There was no human being nearby. She was writhing in pain in her room. I was helplessly standing outside the room. I suddenly thought of going inside and strangulating her. Her cries stopped suddenly. And instead of her cries I heard.. Swamiji Maharaj.. Swamiji Maharaj.. ..will I get respite from a serious crime like killing a child.. ..if I go to Chadrakup? For 12 years.. I couldn't forget this sin I committed even for a moment.. ..in the last 12 years. I couldn't forget it. I'm alive because I'm hopeful that Chadrakup Baba will forgive me. He'll give me respite. Father.. Almighty.. give me respite from my sins. Save me, lord. Save me. Almighty lord, let your ashes bring peace to my heart, body and soul. Quench my thirsty soul and give me peace. Have mercy on me, lord. Have mercy on me. Hey Chandrachur.. "You eradicate sorrows and protect the world." "Hey Parvati.." "You eradicate sorrows and protect the world." "Hey Neelkantha.." "You eradicate sorrows and protect the world." "Hey Lord Shankar.." "You eradicate sorrows and protect the world." "You eradicate sorrows and protect the world." "You eradicate sorrows and protect the world." "You eradicate sorrows and protect the world." "You eradicate sorrows and protect the world." "You eradicate sorrows and protect the world." "You eradicate sorrows and protect the world." Look at the grace of Chandrakup Baba. I'll put the offerings there. Baba will accept them. People who've committed heinous crimes like.. ..killing of women and feticide will get respite if they seek forgiveness from Him. Glory to Baba Chandrakup Swami! - Glory to Him. But if a sinner doesn't confess his crimes then.. ..the mud will stop bubbling. The lord won't respond unless he confesses his sins. The other pilgrims will also be punished for him. No one will get the permission to behold Goddess Hinlaj. Our perseverance and sufferings will be wasted. Maharaj, you're the leader of our group. Come forward with your offerings. Oh Lord! Oh God! I've confessed the heinous crime that I've committed. I won't get respite unless you forgive me. I won't get to behold Goddess Hinlaj too. Please accept my prayers. I'm Sundarlal Bajoria. I never committed any heinous crime like killing a woman or feticide. Hey Mahakal! Hey Chandrakup Swami! What's this? Why did the mud stop bubbling? What crime have you committed? Confess your sins. I.. I.. Then why didn't Baba accept your prayers? Why did Chandrakup calm down? I won't let you spoil the pilgrimage. We'll sacrifice you in Chandrakup if you don't confess. Confess or we'll sacrifice your life. - Of course. Believe me. Please believe me. Please believe me Baba Chandrakup, I never.. Shut up! Liar! Fraud! Why did Baba reject your prayers if you didn't commit any sin? Confess if you wish to live or.. - Stop! Ruplal, don't lose your temper. Sundarlal, you may not have committed the sin directly. Don't you remember any sin in which you were indirectly involved? But she was a maid. Mother had thrown her out of the house. I never heard anything about her again. Who knows if I was responsible for her fate? Yes. Confess what had happened. Confess what had happened. I was 18-19 years old at that time. There was a maid who worked for us. Her name was.. Glory to Baba Chandrakup! - Glory to Him. Baba Chandrakup Swami, I'm a sinner. I didn't follow the rules of the society. I didn't follow the customs. I fell in love with a man. I lost my honor because of the sins. Thirumal became insane because of my sins. He saved my life but I left him behind and came here. I'm illiterate. I don't know any sacred mantras. I don't want salvation. You know what I want. Please help him get back his sanity. I pray that he lives a healthy life. Bring him back to me. Kunti! - Who? These rogues thought that they can escape with you. They planned to snatch you away from me. No one has snatched me away. No one can separate us. Don't come forward. I'm coming. Thirumal! Kunti. - Be careful, Thirumal! Shut up! I want to go to my Kunti. Stop, Thirumal. Stop! Kunti. Kunti.. I'm coming. Thirumal! Glory to Goddess Hinlaj! - Glory to her. Glory to Goddess Hinlaj! - Glory to her. "One who abides in all beings in the form of intelligence.." "..and grants enjoyment and liberation." "Salutations to you, Devi Narayani."

This girl has lost everything she had in Chadrakup. Okay, you don't have to go ahead. Seek blessings from here and wait for us in my ashram. Stick-bearer, carry on. Glory to Goddess Hinlaj! - Glory to Her. Glory to Goddess Hinlaj! - Glory to Her. How long do we have to walk? I can't see the ashram yet. Let's go back to the river bank. There it is. - Where? Over there. Can't you see something dark there? It must be the roof of the ashram. - Oh yes! You're right. I didn't notice. Come on, hurry up. let's go. It's getting very hot. Did we make a mistake? No. No. I think it's hidden behind the hillock. Over there? - Yes. No. We made a mistake. The ashram can't be so far from the river. I want to drink water. You can't drink water here. Let's go back to the river bank. We'll definitely find the ashram there. Okay. Let's go. River? Where's the river? I want to drink water. - Where's water? Let's go ahead. Come with me. We'll soon reach the river. We won't get water unless we reach the river bank. Water.. Water.. Where's water? Kunti.. Kunti.. Bhairavi.. We've lost the way. Let's sit down. - Yes. Let's sit here. Kunti! Kunti! What do I do now? What do I do? Bhairavi, stop. I'll pickup Kunti. Give me strength, mother. Give me, strength. Water.. I want to drink water. Let's go. Hold my hand. Let's go. Bhairavi! Kunti! Who.. how are you related to me? Maharaj.. Maharaj.. Why don't you answer me? What happened? How can I save you? I can't carry you. It's better to sleep. Sleep peacefully. I'll keep watch over you. No one will say anything. No one will do anything. Glory to Mother Hinlaj! Glory to you. You'll die because of my sins. You'll die because of my sins. Where's Thirumal? I'll go to Thirumal. If I go away you'll be alive. Clouds will cover the sky. It'll rain. Water.. water.. I want water.. What kind of deity are you? You don't forgive the sinners. Don't you feel ashamed that you punish the innocent.. ..for someone else's crimes? You can only hurt people. You can only make them suffer. You can only spread the fire. Why don't you give some water? Water.. little water. I'm coming. Don't be angry. Come near me, Thirumal. Come and embrace me. Come, Thirumal. No.. no one can keep Thirumal away from me. I'm coming. don't call me so ardently. Thirumal! Thirumal! Thirumal! Thirumal! The sandstorm couldn't kill us. We didn't even die of thirst. Our co-travelers had found us. We're going back after completing pour pilgrimage to Hinlaj. But, they who didn't follow the rules of the society. The ones who didn't follow the customs. They only followed the ancient norm of this world- love. Did they get lost in the mud volcano of Chandrakup.. ..and amidst the desert sands? It's hard for me to believe that they're lost forever. Whenever I close my eyes I can see them leave their bodies behind.. ..and depart to the eternal abode of love. They're wandering around happily holding each other's hands.. ..in the world of eternal love. The union which was looked down as a sin.. ..has become immortal after their deaths. "The homeless wayward love finds an address at your benevolent feet." "If a tempest razes, we'll face it bravely." "How far is it? How far?" "Mother, when will the travails of our journey end.." "..and when will we find peace under your affectionate shelter?" "How far is it? How far?"
