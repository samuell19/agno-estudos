In this book are collected all the prophecies of Eibon, ...handed down from generation to generation... ...over more than 4,000 years... You ungodly warlock! Because of you this hotel... ...and this town... ...will be cursed forever! The seven dreaded gateways are concealed in seven cursed places... Woe be unto him who ventures near without knowledge... Be careful what you do, ...because this hotel was built over one of the seven doors of Evil, ...and only I can save you! Woe be unto him who opens one of the seven gateways to hell, ...because through that gateway, ...Evil will invade the world... I told you, Martin, we can't. All I inherited was this hotel, nothing else... But it would be such a pity not to. - Let me at least finish the plans... - No, forget it. I won't even charge you for it! Look, really, it's not the case. I just want to clean up the outside walls a bit and... ...maybe tidy up inside and then... Well, if business starts booming, we'll see... It's better if you do it now. Wait four months and you are going to lay out! You can't imagine the effect... ...that double-digit inflation is having on housing... Hi, Larry! How's it going? Oh, good morning! We oughta have this whole wall finished by tonight! - Great! - 'Bye! The outside's okay, good old 1800's Louisiana, ...but the interior, I mean, ...hotels just aren't run the way they were 50 years ago... The eyes! The eyes! Her eyes... ...eyes...! Arthur! Where's that doctor? He's on his way. This man needs to get to a hospital. I'll clean up the wound first. Have you got any water? I'm sorry, but till the plumber comes, ...I'm afraid I can't get you any. Then we better move him, right now. Give me a hand, will you? Take the legs, gently... Okay, up! - Thank you, Doctor. - It's okay... How can I um... check up on him? Ask for me at the hospital... John McCabe! We're off to a great start... Let's just hope there isn't any lasting damage... I sure would like to know how a man can fall off a scaffolding... ...six feet wide... Liza... hey! Look at this picture... I wasn't aware you'd already scored a client... Client? There isn't a soul here! I guess it must've been Arthur. Yeah. Hey is anybody home? Just a minute, coming! Good morning! You're the plumber? - Ayup. - Joe, right? Yes ma'am... What's the trouble? Um, no thank you, I'm afraid I can't tell you. Nothing comes out of the faucets and yet... ...somehow the basements flooded. You tell me. The whole basement? - And how! - Well let's take a look. Okay... Follow me. Hope it isn't too serious... Watch out, the stairs are real slippery... Well, here it is. How long do you think it'll take? It'll take as long as it takes. Martha! I made this little pathway to the far end... ...just for Joe. Thank you, Martha... Well, I'll go take that look... Where's Arthur? He's upstairs, tidying up the rooms. We're doing our best to help, Miss Merrill... Yes, I know, thank you. Listen, I'll be going into town later. Would you please make a list of all the things we need? - Yes. - Okay? Don't worry. Arthur! What're you doing in my room? I was looking for keys... Which keys? I told Ma that I was gonna clean up the rooms, ...but some of them are... Locked. Well... I'll just have to find the keys, Arthur, won't I? Or else we'll simply call in a locksmith. In the meantime, ...could you go up on the roof and check the chimney? I think it's clogged. I heard a car drive up before. Was it Joe? Yeah. Why? You are Liza, aren't you? Yes. My name is Emily. I've been looking for you. Joe! Arthur? I don't understand, Emily. How do you...? Don't worry, I know the way by heart... ...and there's always Dicky here. Come, Liza, I'll show you the way. Joe! Emily... Why did you say I must give up the hotel? I can't explain it to you, ...just take my word for it. Go back to where you came from, and hurry! Leave this place! What's the matter? I don't know. He's in amazingly good shape... ...for a corpse that's supposed to've been dead six years. D.A. said to open him up and see what he had for breakfast. How about if we give a try with...? Forget it. Wire this old guy into your brain wave machine? - Why not? - Okay, okay... But you're on your own with this one. I warn you though, when I get back, ...I'm gonna give him an autopsy... Harris here. Miller wants you up in 24, on the double. I'm on my way, honey. Wait for me here, Jill. I won't be long. Mommy! What did you do in the Big Apple? Just about everything a girl could do, ...without losing her good English breeding and reputation: Modeling, dancing, secretary... ...I almost became an unsuccessful fashion designer, ...when this letter arrived announcing the inheritance... Big surprise, huh? More or less... I knew I had a rich uncle who was a bachelor with a lot of real estate. I never imagined from one day to the next that I'd be running a hotel. Tell me, with all these accidents, ...you know, with Joe the plumber and the housepainter, ...do you think you'll give it up now? I couldn't do that if I wanted wanted to... ...it... this is my last chance. Either I run this hotel, or I go on relief... Well I tell you what, ...when you get the hotel fixed up, I'll come and stay there, okay? So you can book me a room now. Sure! You got it! The best in the house! Oh, of course! How long do you think it'll be before it's ready? I don't know, it's dragging on so much... Arthur and Martha are more of a hindrance than a help... They just can't seem to get it together... Well, if you... ...hired them, you can fire them. But I can't fire them, they came with the hotel! Strange... I've never heard of them! Doctor McCabe! You're wanted on the phone. It's the hospital. Oh, thank you. Excuse me... Yeah? Oh, Harris, hi! What? ...in heaven... ...give us this day our daily bread, ...and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those... ...who trespass against us... ...lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen. And as we commit the souls of Joe and Mary Ann... ...to our Father in heaven, we pray together... O merciful Lord, watch over Jill, their daughter, ...whom Joe and Mary Ann's untimely departure... ...has left alone in this world, a helpless child. Comfort her, and guide her, and give her strength. We ask this, O Lord, in the name of the Father and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen. Courage, my child. Liza! Emily? Why didn't you listen to me, Liza? We blind see things more clearly. I wanted to spare you... ...but now I'll have to tell you everything. Sixty years ago, everybody in this hotel disappeared... ...every last person. A painter called Sweick, who lived here, ...closeted in his room, ...had found a key... What key? The Seven Gateways... ...to Hell! This house was constructed on one of the... Who else is in here?! There's nobody here. I can feel a presence. Somebody else is in here! No, Emily... ...nobody's here. Yes... It's him! He's here again! He's come back to the hotel... Get a hold of yourself, Emily, please. What is this? That? A painting. Just an old painting. There's the bell! That's the bell from Room 36! That's where he was killed, in his room! 36 was Sweick's room! The man who found the key! He's returned, Liza. Don't ever enter that room! Now look, Emily, I've lived in New York all my life, ...there's one thing I've learned not to believe in, it's ghosts... I was lucky to inherit this hotel. It's the first good break I've had, ...and it'll take more than a faulty electrical contact... ...or some crazy story to make me give it up! Emily! Liza! Oh, John! But I saw him... ...there! Nailed to the wall! You see those nails? Well they certainly look old, ...but this looks more like rust than blood. Now it seems so impossible... ...so absurd... ...and yet... Ah, I don't know... Now look... Come and tell me exactly what you saw, huh? No, never mind, it's useless. I guess I must just have a pretty wild imagination. I got carried away by that story that Emily told me about Room 36. Emily? Who's Emily? The blind girl that lives in the old house by the crossroads. There's no blind girl living there, ...and I know everyone around here. The book! The book that was on the desk, it's gone! ...open two walls, see, and lengthen the basement, ...and you'd have room for a kitchen, and maybe even for a laundry! Huh... whattya think of that? Martin... I've already told you, I don't have the money. Do whatever you want to, as long as it doesn't cost! - I have carte blanche? - Yes, but not a blank check. Well the first thing we do... ...is bring someone in to pump out all the water. That I can get done real cheap. And then... on the other side, I'll make a living room and a game room. Have you got the original plans of the cellar? The... there was another book here, ...a different one! You want to buy the book? No, not this one... The one that was here a second ago. That book's been there for two years. Nobody wants to buy it. It's very nice though, very, very interesting. Liza! What's wrong? Buying books? I was just looking for... Is anything the matter? You look sick. It's nothing. I'm just a little tired that's all. I think I'm beginning to see things... I get the picture; I'll have to go to the Town Hall... ...and dig out the originals from the files. Reopen that hotel? Anyway all the turn of the century building plans... ...are on those upper shelves there... Uh, they should be under what the card says, MI3.012. Well let's get 'em down and look at 'em. You surprise me, Mr. Avery. You haven't heard about our town employee's latest labor victory? Took a three week strike to win. Yeah, it was something about lunch, ...an earlier break. I'm sure you'll be okay on your own. I'll be out till... I dunno, till one or a quarter of. You feel completely at home now, y'hear? Have a happy lunch. Thank you! I'm going to lock the door. That way you won't be disturbed! First from one to two, now from 12 to one, ...three weeks of picketing, a GREAT labor victory... Now then... M13.012. Mandeville... Seven Doors Hotel... Hotel... Seven Doors. What the...! "The seven dreaded gateways to Hell... ...are concealed in seven cursed places..." Good boy, Dicky. Good boy. Who's there?! Answer me! I know you're there! Where are you? Who are you? Who?! I know it's you. I can sense it! What do you want from me now? What is it now?! Sweick, I know you're here. No, no! No! No, Sweick! Go away! I don't want to go back! You can't take me! I don't want to go back! Stop tormenting me! Don't come any closer! Don't come any closer! No! No! Go away! Leave me in peace! No! Go away! Don't touch me! You can't take me back! I did what I'd been asked! Now leave one alone! Go! Go away! Away! No! I never spoke! You can't condemn me... I don't want to go back! Attack, Dicky, attack! Dicky, attack! Don't let them get near me! Attack, Dicky, atta-ack! Attack! Dicky! Attack! Chase them away! Chase them away! Dicky, attack! Get rid of them, Dicky! Get them! Attack, Dicky! Attack! Good boy, Dicky... ...good boy. You made them go away. Arthur? Liza! Liza stop it! Stop it! Come on, come on, stop it! Come on, it's me! Calm down. You're okay. Come on, sit down here... I saw Arthur. He was dead but... Liza, stop it! Look, I'm sick of hearing all these stories! What stories? Well, like the first one, ...about the man nailed to the wall in Room 36... ...and the blind girl that doesn't exist...! But Emily's real! She does exist, I... I saw her! I spoke to her! The girl that lives in the old house by the crossroads? Yes! That house has been abandoned for the last 50 years... But that's not true! It's not possible! I was there, I... I mean I went there... I was there... Yes, I knew you were there... I found the book you'd left for me to read... You found the book? And I read it. What did it say? Show me where you saw Arthur. Here. And he tried to kill you, huh? Please, John, you... ...you must believe me... I swear... So where's Arthur now? But I don't know! He attacked me. I was trying to break free. He was here... The cuts on my... There are none. I must be going crazy! Perhaps... ...or else... Who are you, Liza? Who are you, really? But John... I don't understand you! What a question! Why do you ask? Because according to the Book of Eibon... ...this hotel... ...is one of the Seven Gateways of Hell! And you will face the Sea of Darkness, ...and all therein that may be explored. Strange, there... ...there isn't a soul in sight. Yeah. Well we'll be at the hospital pretty soon. I wanna talk to Harris. Where is everybody? Let's try the laboratory. - But John, I... - No, Liza. I'm a doctor. I won't accept irrational explanations. I want to talk to Harris. I'm gonna call the FBI. John! The elevator! Get the hell going! John, quick! Jill! Harris, what the hell is going on around here? I don't know! I think I'm going crazy! Here they come!! It's Jill. She was in the autopsy theatre, all alone. This way! We're under the hotel! Impossible! It's crazy! Come on. And you will face the Sea of Darkness, ...and all therein that may be explored...
