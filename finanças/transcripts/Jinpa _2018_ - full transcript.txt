JINPA It is a disgrace for Khampa clan when a revenge is not taken. The road passes through the isolated terrain of Kekexili, which is a region situated at an average elevation above 5,000 meters, with extremely harsh conditions and few inhabitants. How beautiful a sunny day is! After a storm the air feels serene. The fresh air is a celebration. How beautiful a sunny day is! But no other sun is more beautiful than my sun upon your forehead. Oh, the sun, my sun, upon your forehead. How beautiful a sunny day is! After a storm the air feels serene. The fresh air is a celebration. How beautiful a sunny day is! But no other sun is more beautiful than my sun upon your forehead. Oh, the sun, my sun, upon your forehead. Come on! What a terrible day! A sheep ended up under my tire. Put that under the seat. Don't block the gear stick. Do you smoke? No. You don't look the lucky type. Just don't bring me more misfortune. It must be your ill luck. That explains the sheep! What's your name? Jinpa. Jinpa? Who gave you the name? A lama. Are you a pilgrim? Can't you hear me? Are you deaf? I'm talking to you. Are you a pilgrim? No. I'm on my way to Sanak. I see. I'm going that way too. I'll take you. You enjoy your snuff? I'm used to it. You want some? I don't like it. What about this? I asked you, and you said you didn't have any. You asked whether I smoked, not whether I had cigarettes. What's the difference? I asked whether you smoked to see whether you had cigarettes. I don't carry cigarettes, and I don't smoke. Someone thought I was a pilgrim and gave me this. Giving pilgrims cigarettes! He told me to smoke when I'm tired. What's wrong with you? Give me a cigarette. You never asked. Bullshit! I'm being kind. So you're sitting here comfortably. Damn bum! Give me one. Can't you see I'm driving? Light it. That's more like it. You're actually okay. It's no too bad having you along. You don't talk. You must be lonely. I'll sing you a song. How beautiful a sunny day is! After a storm the air feels serene. The fresh air is a celebration. How beautiful a sunny day is! But no other sun is more beautiful… How do I sound? Not very good. How beautiful a sunny day is! After a storm the air feels serene. The fresh air is a celebration. How does this sound? He's a bit better than you. He's a famous tenor. You have no idea. What will you do in Sanak? I asked what you'll be doing in Sanak. I'm going to kill a man. You're a funny guy. Just look at you. You aren't the killing type. You don't believe me. Suit yourself. You asked me; it's not that I wanted to tell you. Twenty years ago a guy killed my father and ran away. I've looked for him everywhere. I've been searching for more than ten years, and I haven't been able to find him. When will we arrive in Sanak? Just before dark. What is it? In a hurry to kill? I've waited over ten years. I can wait one more day. Who's this girl? My daughter. Her mother died. Do you know the name of that song I sang? No. 'O sole mio. She's my only child. She's like the sun to me. So I like that song. You have no idea. We'll get there just after that pass up ahead. Ok. Here we are. This is it. What's your name? I'm also Jinpa. Jinpa? Who gave you the name? A lama. SANAK Have a cigarette. Thank you! Why do you wear sunglasses all the time? No reason. Finished unloading. Hurry up! Your sweetheart keeps asking about you. Meat for sale! Fresh meat! Meat for sale! Fresh meat! Meat for sale! Fresh meat! How much for the whole sheep? I'll give you a good price for the whole sheep. How much? Let me see. 664 RMB. You can do your own calculation. That's fine. How much for a live sheep this size? About 500 RMB. Not much of a profit. It isn't easy killing animals to support a family. I'll go to the monastery first, then come back to buy this. I thought you were buying. Fresh meat for sale! Any monks in the monastery? Who else but monks in a monastery! This damned beggar is right. Spare me some change. I'm starving. I need to buy some food. Thank you. You've left the door open. Shut it for me. What's this? A dead sheep. What's this? A dead sheep. How can you bring a dead sheep to the monastery? I'm a lorry driver. I ran over this sheep. Om Mani padme hum! It was bad luck. There wasn't a living soul around. Suddenly it ended up under my tire. Please guide its soul to the next stage of life. I feel bad. To help a sheep's soul? Look at this poor thing. Who knows what bad karma it has! Don't fool around. Take it away! I'm not joking. I'm sincere. Look at this poor thing. Please help its soul. Put it down. I'll chant a prayer. Thank you. Just as the warrior Mañjuśrī attained omniscience, and Samantabhadra too. All these merits now I dedicate to train and follow in their footsteps. Om Mani padme hum. Isn't that a prayer for humans? Animals are living souls like humans. They're at different places in the same wheel of life. You know so much. Now it has guidance, and will find its way. Please take this 500 RMB. It's not necessary. You helped its soul. Please accept it. Alright. You can leave now. What should I do with it? That I don't know. Please give me advice. Its soul has found its way; now you can eat it. I killed it. I shouldn't eat it. Then give it to the vultures. Will that be acceptable? Yes, it will bring good karma. Good. Give it to me. It'll last me a whole month, and also bring you good karma. You would eat it alone, but many vultures could share it. Is it the same? The vultures will carry it to the sky. Can you do that? You're right. To the vultures, then. Here. Take this 200 RMB. Buy yourself some meat to eat. That's kind of you. Here, help me carry this to the sky burial site. Ok. Om Mani padme hum. Om Mani padme hum. Fresh meat for sale! Fresh meat for sale! Good price! Hey! Yes. I'm back to buy the whole sheep. It's been sold. Only have this half sheep left. Ok, I'll take that half. Are you really buying? Yes. Ok. Where should I put it? Here. Why is there blood? Alright. 332 RMB. You said you'd give me a good price. Yes, that was for a whole sheep, not a half. That's fine. Here is your change. See you. See you. I didn't think you were coming. Why wouldn't I? What's the matter? Nothing. Is there another woman? No. Then why can't you? No reason. I met a man yesterday. Don't you always meet different people? He was from the Khampa region. He's different. How? He and I have the same name. He's also called Jinpa. So what? Many people share the same name. He said he was on his way to kill a man. Nowadays nobody dares kill anybody just like that. SANAK KHAMPA TEAHOUSE Do you have sweet tea? Yes. A warm pot. Big or small? Small. A kilo of meat. Ok. What else? Some buns. How many? Fifteen. Ok. Hey, miss, five more beers. Ok. Thirty more buns. You just had fifteen. You shouldn't. And more beers. Wait a second. Haha! You drink horse piss and get naughty. Bottoms up! Old man, your Vajrakilaya has popped out. This amulet protects me. No knives can cut me. What about bullets? People now don't believe it. It was from a lama from the Sharde Monastery. I have worn it for more than ten years. That year my wife and I went on pilgrimage to Lhasa. We were just off to pray at dawn. My wife kept talking. I scolded her. She got angry and left. I sat down at a teahouse, and ordered my tea. A Khampa man came in. His hair tied up in a warrior tassel. He carried a dagger around his waist. He sat down next to me. He asked whether I wanted a Vajrakilaya. He took out a yellow handkerchief with a Vajrakilaya wrapped inside. It was rare. It showed a naturally formed Tibetan letter ཨ. Finally I bought it for 20,000 RMB. Your buns. Where are mine? Yours aren't ready. I ordered first, but they got theirs first! They're old customers. That's why. What kind of service is this? This is our way here. Come, let's eat. Go on, you eat. This Vajrakilaya is quite something! I went for pilgrimage that year, did some business and benefited from it. Hey, miss! Miss! Yes. These buns are smaller than eyeballs. Fifteen more! There aren't any more. Get me your boss! She's the boss. Haha! How come there aren't any more? The kitchen is closed. We don't serve food now. Only drinks. I see… Anything else? Sit down. How's the meat? Delicious. I'm looking for someone. Who? He arrived yesterday. A bum from Khampa region. A thin guy? I thought he was a beggar. That's him. He didn't make any trouble did he? No. He was looking for Martsa. Martsa? Yes. Martsa. He wanted to find Martsa. That's what he said. Did he find him? I think so. Mister, would you like more sweet tea? There won't even be any tea left soon. Do you have beer? What kind? What brands do you have? Lhasa. Budweiser. Two Budweisers. Big or small? Small. Your Budweisers. Are these really Budweisers? They don't even have labels. They fell off. I forgot to paste them back on. Do you want them opened? I'll do it myself. You need to shake a Budweiser before you drink it. It tastes better. That's it. All the drivers do this. Do they? Yes, but why? Tell me. Why? How do I know? Why do you wear those sunglasses? No reason. You're different from the people around here. Join me. Put it on my tab. I'll pay tomorrow. Make sure you do. I've drunk too much today. I'll pay tomorrow when I'm sober. Didn't you say you saw that Khampa man? Tell me. Why do you ask? I know him. Let me tell you. After a big snowfall that day, somebody saw him. That year my wife and I went on pilgrimage to Lhasa. We were just off to pray at dawn. My wife kept talking. I scolded her. She got angry and left. I sat down at a teahouse and ordered my tea. A Khampa man came in. His hair tied up in a warrior tassel. He carried a dagger around his waist. He sat down next to me. He asked whether I wanted a Vajrakilaya. He took out a yellow handkerchief with a Vajrakilaya wrapped inside. It was rare. It showed a naturally formed Tibetan letter ཨ. Finally I bought it for 20,000 RMB. I went for pilgrimage that year, did some business and benefited from it. Are you the hostess? I'm looking for a man. Is there a man named Martsa in this town? Are you begging for food or looking for someone? If you're begging, get out of there. I'm not begging for food. I'm buying food. Put away your money. There are thieves around here. Get me a beer. What kind? What do you mean? A beer for drinking. Don't you know anything? I asked what brand. No idea. I thought you were a man of the world. You don't even know this. We have Lhasa Beer, or Budweiser. Which one? Lhasa beer. Big or small? What do you mean? Two swigs in a small botlle, four in a large. Large. Ok. Take the money. Do you have noodles? Yes. One portion. Ok. One bowl of noodles. Alright. Come over here. I want to ask you something. Is there someone named Martsa in this town? Yes. He runs a grocery store. Is he from Gojo Sa-ngen? He is around 50. Are you a relative? Noodles are ready! Ok. Mister, you haven't eaten for days? Is there someone called Martsa here? Yes. He runs a grocery store. Is he from Gojo Sa-ngen? He's around 50. Are you looking for relative? Is he from Gojo Sa-ngen? That I don't know. He's about 50. He has run his store for 2 years, but doesn't seem to be planning to stay here. He's very quiet, as if there's a lot on his mind. He doesn't socialise, just goes to pray in the monastery. He's pious, not very rich, invites a lama to do rituals and free some animals every year. Everyone knows him, and all find him somewhat strange. Mister, is it him that you are looking for? Are you alright? I've found him at last. Look! His bag is still here. He never came back. If I see him in the street, I will immediately recognize him. But he might have already left town. That bag is definitely his. Where has he gone? How do I know? If I knew, would I have let him leave his bag? Is Martsa still staying in town? Where else can he go? He is always in his store keeping himself busy. Doing who knows what. Have you seen him today? No. It's true, not today. You don't think he's been killed? What are you talking about! MARTSA'S GROCERY Can I help you? Is this Martsa's shop? Do you know him? No. Neither did the man who came yesterday. Martsa seems unsettled these few days. Where is he now? Praying in the monastery. He'll be back soon. Have some tea. xxx Your accent isn't local. No. I'm a lorry driver. I've never seen you before. I seldom pass this way. Where is the Khampa man from yesterday? He left in tears as soon as he saw Martsa. Why did he cry? I don't know. Is he your friend? No. I give him a lift here. Mama. My son. Mom, who is this? He's here to see your Pa. Where's your Pa? He's coming back now. Om Mani padme hum. Om Mani padme hum. This man is waiting for you. Come, my boy. Ok. Who are you? My name is Jinpa. I'm a lorry driver. Are you Martsa? Take some tea. Hey! Are you alright? I'm fine. I walked too fast just now. Can I help you? Did a Khampa bum come by here? I gave him a lift here. He said he was looking for you. Yes, he came. He came to see me. When he saw me, he said it wasn't me he was looking for. I made him some tea. He drank it but then left crying. I haven't seen him again. I have to go. I'll go and look for him. What is the matter? Nothing. "If I tell you my dream, you might forget it. If I act on my dream, perhaps you will remember it; but if I involve you, it becomes your dream too." Tibetan proverb The fatalistic carriage proceeds day and night, leading us to the wasteland. At the source of sympathy and compassion is the company of a dictator. A black car comes and goes through the streets, selling predictions for the future. Great beauties of the past are debased as cheap sluts. Children rot like left-overs of past meals. Bachelors without a bed raise the axe of the sky, trying to kill the fawn in their illusion. That is in vain. Living is in vain. All is in vain. Freezing souls destroyed by songs gather in a praying hall lit up with butter lamps. They daze at the dance of the silent fairies. They need a staff like the snowy mountain, an umbrella like the sky. The nerves tortured with the heat of June need baptism with nectar and poison. So hungry yet staying away from food. So sad yet seeking out sorrow, because there is no choice. The wings of light slash the dark night. Bright blood flows to clarify things around. Indulgence in feeble words cannot help express the imagination. Engrossed in sunlight blooming. Fearful of proverbs in the wrong order. Avoiding female wisdom to exaggerate. Content with the satisfaction of saying what one wants to. Waking from a dream, but too late. This is not the world I want. Not like this. This is not the world I want. Subtitles ripped by Peterlin
