Nobody knows Professor, how could such a tree grow on cement in the county? There's a swamp by the Paradise Lake There perhaps stands the tree lts sacred tonic trunk towering up in chill silence smacks deep in the middle of the county Find that tree, boy, and you'll learn the secret of life yourself Find it and become a hero of Raintree County Do you really think it there? Why don't you have a real good see for yourself? Professor, you still haven't answered the question Do you really think it there? lt's there alright lt's there--- But the sacred fire is ready to be back if you look for it l'm sure you'll find it What'll happen if what you presume the raintree we don't find?

Remember, young man--- Union belongs to those who keep breath in the cabinet What cousin said means, Johnny--- if succession comes--- the north should succeed Hear him say--- Sir, one thing you must understand Johnny is a poet He stays 2 months with his girlfriend--- therefore, he loves south l'm not so sure you prove it That's because he's a moralist You won't get straight answers from him He'll draw up opinion for another name He's also a dreamer--- a seeker for the meaning of life with capital wealth Sir, your search has ended Stay here with us and help us to build our dream We have thousand dreams for a great republic on this soil of merit with it's pretty homes and most beautiful---women 0h, Sam ---you're wonderful You shelf like some golden pitfalls Cousin Sam ---Johnny doesn't like slavery Does Johnny like to waive slaves in the north?

There were some wrangles--- 2 bodies were found together So? So it looks like something funny had been going on They might've been killed before the fire l mean everybody else got up and away Why didn't they? That's the question of identification--- which woman was that woman? Which? There was talk of Susana's father with the woman who was found in shock The woman---the woman--- who was found with? l exaggerated, Johnny Anyway, the thing was hers--- it was better the way as it was 0f course, there was a lot of talks--- You know how woman talk in this family--- women are worse the most l don't want to scare you, boy But you don't need a private life because you've a beautiful wife That's the worth of it Alright, what happened after the fire? Well, nothing much 0h, the excitement Susana had taken and disappeared for 2 or 3 days l forget now They found her finally She was in Henrietta's cabin all the time And Susana had to go up to her aunt's place in Pennsylvania That's all l know about it Does anybody else know?
