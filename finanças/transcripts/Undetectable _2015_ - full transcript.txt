- What time is your appointment? - Nine. You want some breakfast? - I'm getting a blood test today. - Everything will be all right Adam. - I love you. - I love you too. Don't be nervous all right. - I won't. I'm sorry I kept you waiting. - No problem Dr. Nazemi. - You look good Adam, how have you been? - Fine, thank you. Working a lot, I've been trying to keep myself busy. - Good, I'm happy to hear. Let's go over your results, shall we? - Yeah. - Your blood count came back normal. Your t-cell count is also on par with the last test. Liver normal, kidney also came back normal. Your cholesterol seems a bit higher than the last six months. Don't worry I'll just prescribe something for that. The good news is that your viral load is within undetectable levels. The treatment has the virus under complete control. You have any questions? - No, no. This is all good news, isn't it? - I know this year has been really difficult for you but you have to be proud of yourself. You have taken all the necessary measures to keep yourself in the best health possible. I know, I know, it's just that-- - What's the matter? - It's stupid, it's just I've been, I've been having these night terrors. Night terrors? - Adam, some of the medications prescribed to treat your condition may cause hallucinations and anxiety. I assure you, they're only documented side effects in patients with your condition. - No, no, no! I'm sorry. I'm going to refer you to one of my colleagues. Speaking out to somebody about what's really bothering you, it's going to help you feel better. I know exactly what you're thinking. Shit, Rafael you scared the crap out of me. - It's missing something, isn't it? Well it's nice to see you too my boo-boo. To what do I owe the pleasure? - I wanted to see you. - How thoughtful of you. Here. Look at me. Do you like what you see? Good, now please carry on. - Look Rafael I know you're upset with me-- - I am not upset Adam! I'm just trying to figure out what's missing from my painting. I've been out of inspiration lately. What is it that you want? I went to the doctor today. Has it been a year already? Well I barely noticed it. I guess time just flies when you're having so much fun. - I'm undetectable. - You make it sound like it's hell. - It's not hell it's just, limbo. - I played this blame game a thousand times, and I am bored to death with it. No hurt feelings between you and I. Do not feel guilty. Okay. - I can't help it. I felt terrible this whole year. I needed to speak to someone Rafael and you're the only one who could-- - What? What Adam, what? Understand you? - Make me feel better. You always knew how to make me feel better. - It's me, me, me, always with you. - I was worried about you, I swear. I heard your condition had worsened. They said you were doing really bad. - And I heard you have a new boyfriend. Tell me, did you already get him sick also? - He just tested negative Rafael. We use protection. Make sure he's always safe. - Well I bet you two don't fuck the way we used to. There's no way. - We're in love Rafael. Unconditional love I wish I didn't-- - What? You wish you didn't, cheat on me? Yes. - I have something for you. I want you to have it before, well, before it's too late. - It's beautiful. - Thank you. I want you to do me a favor Adam. When you go home tonight, I want you to get some rest. And when you wake up in the morning, I want you to turn the hour glass on for the first hour of your day. Don't think about the past, ignore the uncertainty of the future. Forget about your problems and just be present. You'll find that the more sand escapes through the hour glass, the clearer you'll see through it. ♪ Just a little bit complicated ♪ Keeps you awake ♪ Just get close to somebody - He's beautiful Adam. I definitely see what you see. - Rafael help me. - I thought about you, I did. Every single day. You know I would've fought this thing with you if you hadn't left me. - What the fuck is going on? What did you do to me? - Shh, I want you to let it go. Do you know how many hours are in a year Adam? 8,760 hours, the first 2,100 hours were the worst. I was sick, I was dumped by my cheating boyfriend. The one who got me sick in the first place. I was left alone. Like I was nothing. Like I was invisible! I'm not invisible. I loved you. You're my boo-boo. And you say that you're undetectable. That's exactly how you made me feel. You made me feel like I don't exist. - What are you doing? - The first six months went by and I wasn't doing so well. My infection kept getting worse and the doctor said there was nothing that they could do for me. So I went to go visit my parents. And they shut the door in my face. So, I took matter in my own hands. And sadly, well, it didn't work out so well. When I thought, everything was lost, she came to me, to my rescue Adam. She chose me, she detected me. And she said to me. - Yesterday is the past. Tomorrow is the future. - Today is a gift. - Babe, babe, it was just a dream. Are you okay? - Yes, yes. - Are you sure? Are you gonna be okay today? - Today? - Beautiful service right? So did you notice his parents didn't show up? I couldn't believe it. - Yeah I don't think he wanted them there anyway. - I just think it's awful. After all that pain, to die alone like that. - Can you just not talk about it anymore? I really don't want to speak about it-- Imagine the pain-- - Let me finish. I'm sorry. I just really don't want to speak about him when I'm with you. I paid my respects, said my goodbyes, and now I'm ready to move on. - You're right. - Want to go get dinner? - Sure, just let me change. How about that French restaurant on Melrose? Read great things about it on Yelp. They have really nice waiters, but candlelight, I know how you feel about that. What? What is it? - You look ravishing my boo-boo. - Boo-Boo? I'll take it.
