Silverware, Grand Marnier glasses, white wine glasses. I don’t know about those calla lilies, change them for tulips. I ask Mari to hit the octopus 60 times, if not it’s chewy and it’s a shame. There’s a black moth in the living room wall. The gardener says we have to wait for it to leave, if not it’s bad luck. It’s my birthday party. I’m wearing the ivory dress I got in New York. The house is beautiful Full of people Everyone looks at me Julio Iglesias is one of the guests He comes to tell me that he loves me, holds my hand Takes me to Spain and we live in the Corte Inglés Did you see the table? I am telling them about the ring... It’s spectacular! Divine! Hello, Mariluz how are you? Javier... Happy Birthday, Sofia. Thank you so much. Thank you for inviting us, your house is gorgeous as always. Thank you. Where’s Fernando? At the office, you know how he is. Sofia de Garay, look at you! Happy Birthday! Thank you. I guess it’s my turn to drive again, right? Inés, don’t be such a drag. Cheers! Cheers! What were you talking about? You were laughing... You tell her, Ale. No way! Gossip? A joke! A girl from a posh catholic college... asks a girl from another posh catholic college Is your daddy a dollarchanger? No? How tacky. Where were you? Javier’s asking about you. Happy birthday. Where have you been? Go get changed, everyone’s waiting Come... Do you like it? No! Baby! What’d you do with the other one? Who cares! Do you like it? It's divine! It’s divine, my love... I love it, I love it! It smells so new, so good, so good! Stop, stop, stop. Our guests! Your son is a man... I’m a woman... I don't understand anything. It’s her son. She’s going to marry the owner’s son. But she doesn’t know it’s out of interest. But that was before, now she loves him. How do you know that? At the hospital, she wants to give him her kidney. Go serve the soup before it gets cold. Sofía’s going to tell a joke. Ready? Patience... let’s see... why are you laughing? A girl from a posh catholic college tells a girl from another posh catholic college Wait, wait, yes, a girl from one posh catholic college... I’m horrible at telling jokes, why do you always do that to me? When there’s no toilet paper or toothpaste, we won’t be laughing. Here’s to toilet paper! Cheers! You know the President said, we have to administer all this bounty. And he wanted to defend the peso like a watchdog. He said that? He sure did, like a Chihuahua. You’re such an idiot. Stop, stop, no more politics! Let's go. Wait. Stop it. Stop what? What’s wrong with her? I’ve no idea. I didn’t tell you. I ran into her... and asked her when she wants to go to Cuernavaca... the 4 of us, see if she’d say anything.... Right. Nothing. Zip, Alejandra. Nothing. Look at her. I don't understand why she won't tell us anything. You can tell they’re not doing well at all. At all. I swear I don’t know why I even invited her. Because you’re polite, Sofia. You should’ve invited Ana Paula. She wants to join the club. Oh no! I know but you’ve no idea the house her husband got for her in Valle de Bravo. She invited me to lunch. Come with me I don't want to go alone. Wait, what? Ana Paula. I’m scared she’ll give me longaniza tacos. I love those. Totally not, don't be tacky. THE GOOD GIRLS Next year I want cannelloni, or cheese soufflé, and French wine. Everyone wants to copy me, Toñis... they copy my dress, my cannelloni... This way, this way... The tulips, they copy everything all the time. Everybody. Did my mom call? No. Tell me the truth: Am I as bad mother as my mother? Tell me the truth, Toñis, the truth. You’re a good mother. Go to sleep, close those little eyes. Happy birthday, Sofi. Thanks, Toñis. Bye mommy! Bye mom! Don't forget to wear your braces... I don’t want to go to camp! Stop it Gaby, there’s bonfires, games, She’s scared of camp You’ll make new friends... I’m not scared of camp. You have your passports? Sure? You have everything? Remember not to hang out with Mexicans, ok? Ok. Good. Mari! President Lopez Portillo addressed the nation from his office. The news everyone was expecting: Today the price of dollar went up again, devastating the national economy, which had been fragile for several months. You don’t have any water either? No. We should order a tanker truck. Sure, I’ll tell my boss. You going on a trip? Sorry? You going on a trip? Mmhm... Where? On vacation. The lady will have the snails and I’ll have the rib eye, medium. Same for me, and for the lady the shrimp. Want to share a Cesar salad? Perfect. Please. You see? So glad we came here, that way we didn’t put you to work. Oh you know I’m always happy to have you over. But we can pamper you here. So? What’s the occasion? What are we celebrating? Well... nothing. Javier, what a mystery! What’s wrong? There’s no easy way to say this, let me get to the point: The Americans backed out of the deal. They think it’s too risky. What does that mean? That means they want nothing to do with us. Terrible news. There will be other opportunities. We needed those dollars Let’s find other dollars then. Things aren’t that simple. I wanted us to get together because... I want you to take over, Fernando. It makes me very sad it has to be under these circumstances, but there's no other choice. Right, so when things get tough, you get going. That’s rich. Fernando, your father worked like a mule to get what he had. When he got to this country, he didn’t have anything. The life you know, he gave it to you. It didn't fall from the sky. I’m just an employee... You’re the owner. What do you mean...? Another bottle, please. What do you mean cancel lots of things? Sofi, why don't we let them talk? We should stay on the sidelines. You know what? Fuck you. Fernando! Calm down. The check! Fernando... Let’s go. He can’t just go and leave you hanging. Talk to a lawyer or something. I thought they were going to tell us they were getting a divorce. What? Divorce? At that age? Why? Baby, are you listening? I don’t know... You don't know what? What to do. What do you mean don't know? I trust you. Everything’s going to be OK. Say it. I’m going to change. I'm tired. President Lopez Portillo inagurated the navy's training ship in a prestigious ceremony accompanied by senior officers by the marines. Hello! Hello Mrs. Sofi, nice to see you. Thank you. You have a match, right? Yes! Alejandra’s already here, she’s waiting. Oh really? Thank you. You're welcome. Did you hear about Luli Medina? Oh, yes. Poor thing. Poor Luli. I mean what would you do if your husband were a good for nothing? I’d leave him. Yeah, me too. He didn’t have anything before meeting her. Nothing. But what happened? She’s leaving the board! Well, they kicked her out. Which is not the same. Why? Poor her. Can I have some milk, please? Thanks. I don't get the deal with Gaby. Mine were so happy. She’s still little. Yeah but it’s not like she’s off to war, camp is awesome. How did the party end? So good, so good. I'm tired. I had a headache from all the red wine. Really? Of course! The octopus was delicious, it was homemade right? Totally. I think it’s really weird to give octopus for dinner. But I’m so old fashioned, right? I really thought it was modern. Everything was so great. And your dress! So comme il faut! It suited you gorgeous. Divine. Divine. Where did you get it? Don’t be so greedy! I have a right to keep some secrets no? If not we’ll all look the same. She got it in New York. We’ll just call Toñita and she can tell us the designer name. I can’t tell you anything right? What did Fernando get you? A car. Didn't you see it in their garage? A Grand Marquis, champagne color. I love that color. Wow so splendid! That’s so generous! Specially with all that's going on. It has double merit, right? Yes we’re so fortunate. Indeed. Yes, things are really bad. Bad. In fact, Fernando had to fire his uncle Javier. Why? I guess poor management. Javier came with Fernando’s dad from Spain. They started the business together. He was the right hand man, since forever. Poor Fernando! Poor Fernando. Yes. Hey, Ricardo’s been in bad mood all week. He’s unbearable. Same as Antonio. Unbearable and he’s coming home for lunch everyday. And what do you cook? He says the president should’ve done that earlier. He also says when modernity comes everything will change. Did he say when it’s coming? What about the husband? He has a brokerage firm. Really? Haven't you seen him? He's tall. So tacky, but he has something. Masculine. Big. I swear it stresses me out to think if she’s wearing the green or purple contacts Purple. Green. Wanna bet? Whoever loses has to blow the doorman a kiss. Chill. I brought rice in case you have space left. Thanks. I love your blouse, where’s it from? Everything’s so delicious. You want something else? No, I’m fine thank you. Doesn’t your husband come for lunch? Oh, my husband.... Nope, almost never. My golden dream! Ale tells me he’s in business. He’s a broker and he does really well. Yes, thank god he does so well. What’s his last name again? Haddad, with an H. Haddad. Haddad. Isa, leave it in case we want more. Yes, ma’am. Oh my god your hair’s fabulous, is that the shampoo I recommended? Isn’t her hair fabulous? I won. She was wearing the green ones. We have to tell her she can’t dress that way. She can’t have that furniture. So do you like dollars more or pesos? Dollars! Finally! Water! Can you imagine if this happened during my birthday? Can’t you call the minister of water or whatever? Right... I’m going to call the president’s house... Seriously, this can’t be. Love, there’s no water minister, there’s the Minister of hydro something resources. Well, whatever! You know what Alejandra told me? That the only thing missing from my party was a celebrity. Can you imagine? How tacky! Next year I’m asking the caterers to do the food, they can make cannelloni or something. Fer. I'm sorry. My uncle Javier’s getting senile. He doesn’t take risks. That’s why we’re screwed. Maybe it’s not such a bad idea for me to be in charge. It’s for the best. Red suits you, ma’am. Really? Yes. It’s exclusive right? Yes. Delicious, right? The other one’s almost the same but green, don't you have it? No, but this one is great. I’m talking about this brand. No, it hasn't arrived yet. That’s all we have. But look at this. Give me this one then, thank you. Of course. Can we get more shoulder pads? Yes, whatever you like. Do you want me to call the seamstress? I am totally not used to buying gala dresses in Mexico. I’ll let my client know. Thank you. Sorry ma’am but the bank isn't authorizing the transaction. Do you want to call them? No. I'll write a check. I am lost in the gentleman’s section at the Corte Inglés. The store is completely empty. I’m looking for Julio Iglesias. I don't see him anywhere. I hear his voice in the distance. I climb the escalator... and I realize he’s having dinner with the kings of Spain. I walk towards him and I hug him. I greet the Kings. My mom’s voice interrupts saying, “Sofia, stand straight hold your head high. You are Sofia De Garay. You are Sofia de Garay." Antonio’s secretary finally answered.. I swear I've been waiting months to meet Beto. Don't even tell me. Beto is just like you. So, Thursday then. Where are you going? Champs Elysees. Please have the "escargots". You want to come? Thursday? We can’t... You’re the worst! Did you tell her you're moving to the neighborhood? Not yet. That’s great! We’re so happy! Ale, did Floren tell you I called? Yes, sorry, I’ve been so busy... You want to something to drink? A little Brandy, Cognac, something? No thanks. Floren! Yes, ma'am. Take care of the ladies. How are you Mrs. Sofía? Very well, Floren. How are you? Fine. Thank you. What will you have? Whisky for me. And for you? I’m fine, thank you, Floren. Thanks. I love your purse. Thanks. It's divine. I’ll sell it to you. Really? No, just kidding. Get the "escargots" and the "coq au vin". So what happened? You got tired of Polanco? Why are you moving here? We wanted something more spacious, for the children. The water shortages are terrible here. Really? Fer and I are even considering moving... to another country. Where’s the Mr.? Asleep in his studio. What’s wrong, are you in a bad mood or what? No. Beto Haddad and his spectacular wife attended the opening for a painting show alongside the cream of Mexican socialites. Yes Floren, it’ Mrs. Sofia. Well, thank you. I’m looking for Mrs. Alejandra, is she around? I wanted to confirm that my husband and I can come to dinner on Thursday to Champs Elysees. Yes. Yes. Great. Will you let her know? It’s important so she can change the reservation. I’ll call again tomorrow morning anyway. Thanks. You too, Floren. Thank you. Goodbye. Good morning. Morning. I need you to be ready tomorrow at 7. What for? We have an appointment. At night. I want you to meet my friend’s husband. He’s a broker or something. Fer, it’s important, O.K.? And you make yourself handsome, O.K.? Of course. My card was declined at the Palacio. I’ll tell Rosi to call the bank. Did you see your uncle Luis? Yes. And? Nothing. Did you tell him about Javier? Do you know what he told me? He said it was coming. Everything's so obvious to them. I was thinking the other day... why don’t you call Pablo? No, Sofía. He has a great position in his uncle’s bank. And tomorrow I want you to go to the office, I don't want the maids thinking their boss is useless. How are you? Did you bring your racket? Yes! Look. Look, like this one. With a bow. Oh no, those suits look bad on me! That’s true. Let me tell you something, you need a good tailor, or even a good seamstress. I have a great tailor. Really? Give us his number. Did you hear about Inés and Daniel? Are they getting a divorce? I don’t know. Every time I see her and ask her for Daniel, she says he's sick. Right, well I hope it’s not contagious. I know they’re bankrupt. They sold their house in Cuernavaca. What? They had to leave the club. Oh no, Ale. No! You’re exaggerating. No, Antonio told me. Daniel’s broke. His debts are too much. How horrible. He says it's a matter of time. Poor Inés. Poor Inés. And do you play tennis? On top of knowing all about tailors... I’m starting classes. Oh, cool! Well, Inés played so well, she’d played since she was little. Very well. So glad they let you into the club. It’s not easy. Why aren’t you eating Ana Paula? I had breakfast at home, but go ahead, eat up! Eat up! Don't say ‘eat up’. So tell me, how was New York? Amazing. Beto and you went alone. Yes. Did you buy many things? You’ve no idea. Beto’s going to have a heart attack when he gets the credit card bill. What? Wasn’t he there with you? You know how they are, men. Unbearable. What did you buy? A hat, a dress, shoes. Julio Iglesias and I are spending the summer on the Balearic Islands. We’re sitting on the deck of a yacht, having a drink. His shirt has a new lipstick stain. Unknown. What time is it? Before I can say anything he says: "Sofia, Fernando's a good man, from a good family. Fernando's a catch." You're drunk. I'm really tired. It doesn’t matter It doesn’t matter Of course, It doesn't matter. You're tired. Yes, right right, Rosi, he must be about to get here. Since he's been so busy with everything. I wanted to check if he was around. What? How? Taking stuff? That's stealing! Why hasn't Fernando called the police? Yes, yes. Don't worry Rosi. I'm sure he'll tell me, thanks. Waiter... Could you tell me the price of the filet mignon? Let me see... It's 350 pesos. They called from the store. What store? Something about a check you paid with. The number is there. Thanks, Toñis. Sofia, your husband forgot to pay us for the week. Did you see him? I’m leaving your pay here. The others need theirs too. I’ll write them a check tomorrow, ok? Mari’s left for her village. You owe her over a month. If Mari’s gone I need you to help me with breakfast tomorrow. Toñis. Yes? Can you make me some quesadillas? I’m starving. Yes, my girl, I’m coming. What did you do? Look at you! Look at the car! I’m so ashamed with Alejandra. Why didn't you arrive? I couldn't care less for the car and for Alejandra. Everything is solved. We’re going to be ok.... Look at you! We're going to be o.k. What are you talking about? I had a fucking good meeting. Fucking great. Listen, listen. We’re good. Listen to what? You can’t even speak well. Speak clearly. We don't have to worry about anything. I just closed a loan. In dollars. Dollars. Who gives a fuck about the car. I’ll buy another one. Two cars in fact. Seriously? In this country everything’s about having connections. Wait, what did Javier say? Javier can suck my dick, he can suck it! That's enough! Ma’am, I know things haven’t been good lately, but I wanted to tell you that check you gave me... bounced. I'll tell Mr. Fernando to pay you in cash, when he wakes up. O.k. When have we ever let you down, Miguel? Never, Ma’am. Right... You can leave now. Thanks. Look, the Labordes are there. Yes, I see them. I thought they were in Vail. Remember Vail? Remember? Of course I do. We have to fire Miguel. He talked back to me the other day. Really? Really? Whatever my queen wants. Stop it, Gaby! Martin, don't do that, you’re going to hurt me. Stop it, Gaby! Miguel, please take Mimosa to the vet, she’s starting to stink. Stop it, Gaby! Yes, ma’am. Sierra Leone. The sign says Sierra Leone. Everyone at camp had a yoyo, I want one. We’ll get you one. What’s wrong? Did you hear about Daniel? No, what? He died. What? How? I am so sorry, really. May God grant you resignation. Thank you. Fernando couldn’t come, he had a lot of work but he sends you a big hug. Thank you. You know we’re here if you need anything. Really. I hate funerals. I never know what to wear. I’ve been to so many this year I even have a section in my closet. So depressing. You think we have to go to the burial? I don’t think so. I mean, we’re here, we’ve done our part. Hey, did you hear what happened? Santiago Izaguirre says that... Daniel felt a pain in his arm and he thought it was nothing. Then he got into the shower and Inés heard a scream. Then she found him lying there. Dead. Good, Fernando’s good. Now that Javier left, he’s in charge. Yes, excatly. About time. So happy. We’re so happy. No. Don't worry. I thought you were too busy. Super fun. Everyone came. Octopus. So good, they’re so big. So tall, they’re divine. Yes, I will send them over to San Diego one of these days. Yes, mom. You too. Bye bye. Hi, Arturo! Hello! Have you seen Alejandra? The lady I play with? Haven’t seen her today. Thanks. You’re welcome. Sofía! How are you? Good, thanks. Did they also shut your water off? Yes. Nice to see you. I’ll see you at Ale’s house? They're helping me with my birthday party. Oh yes... We're all meeting there to plan it. Sure. Good. By the way, we’re throwing Betito a little party so you can bring the kids. They’re back from camp right? Thanks. There’ll be ponies. See you there. What do you think of tulips? Who’s doing them? Marta Sofía, for Ana Paula’s birthday party. Calla lilies would be better. So, what about Julio Iglesias? What about Julio? Beto, Ana Paula’s husband has friends who own a hotel in Acapulco. Turns out they’re really good friends of Julio Iglesias’ and he’s going to be in Mexico... He’s coming to her party? I have to say, I think it’s so tacky they’re getting so excited. Remember when we went on our missionary trip? Remember when I woke up that night because I thought you were crying? We’d seen so many ugly things that day, I thought you were crying because of that, but really you were doing crunches, remember? So weird you’d think that. When we got back, I was the one who told everyone you were crying because you’d lost your virginity. What’s wrong? Are you ok? Me? Sure. You know what we should do? A trip. The four of us. Europe. No kids. Or with the kids but also with Toñita and Floren. We could start with Paris, London, then Spain and Portugal. Sure, let’ do it. It’s been a weird season. I understand if you don't feel in the mood for parties. What do you mean? I mean, parties are for feeling good, having fun. You don’t seem at your best right now. I don’t think Ana Paula would be offended if you don't go to her party. You neither invite her to yours, after all. Where’s Sierra Leone? What? Where’s Sierra Leone? In Africa, love. Do you think yoyos are popular there? Don’t know. I don't think so. Why do you know so much about Africa. I don't know much. Mom, where's Benjamin? Rodrigo come here! Let me see your teeth. You didn’t put your braces on? Yes I did. Yeah right. The kids at camp all went to Disney. When can we go? Ask your dad. In the summer maybe. Mom, where’s Benjamin? Why’s dad sleeping, it’s not night Did you know there’ll be ponies at Beto’s party? Mom, where’s Benjamin? He’s sick. I think Miguel is also sick. Why? Didn’t he come get you at school? Nope. Juan Zamacona’s mom brought us home. Good afternoon. Good afternoon. I work for Mr. Diaz de León. We’re looking for... Mr. Hernandez. Let me see. Just a second. We’re really very sorry... We need to proceed. So if you could please sign here... Mom! What’s ‘repossess’? Julio kisses me one last time... It’s over between us He looks deep into my eyes and sings to me. I ran so much through life... I forgot that life is lived in a moment. I wanted to be first Hello I’ll be right over ok? One more Hi Sebas, how are you? How are your parents? Be careful! Not good Not good, why? Can I have one? Thanks. You have to give me the pony guys’ number. Sure, of course, any time. You know what you’re wearing for my birthday? You’re coming right? You haven’t confirmed... Right, sorry, it’s just that Fernando’s so busy. Please come! It’s going to be great. I’m going to set up a dance floor in the garden and everything. So many parties. Yes. Every year it’s the same. Betito and I have birthdays one after the other... I do want to buy that purse from you. It’s not for sale. Why do you wear colored contacts? The girls in the club say you wear the purple ones to look like Elizabeth Taylor and the green ones to look like Sophia Loren. What else do they say? That I’m a slut like Liz? Because I was with Beto when he was still married? Or that I married for money? Why are you so fucking arrogant? Everyone knows what’s going on with you. One should say ‘every body’. You think I don't know why you didn’t invite me to your party? Or why Alejandra and all those spoiled girls suddenly want to be my friends? Who do you think you are, Sofia? Sir! You have a call. Sir! If you think we’re so horrible, why do you want to be here? Honey, we all want to live like princesses. Or do you think it’s just you? When you turn around, people talk behind your back too, they say horrible things... –Beautiful... –Divine Where have you been? Why didn't she invite Ines? You don't know? It seems like Daniel didn't have a heart attack. No way. He shot himself. Daniel? It's a shame, right? God, Lore, who says that? Lupita Ruiz Rincón, Marianita said so... She asked to keep it secret. Hi Sebas, how are you? How are your parents? Is it true that Rodrigo and Martin’s dad’s a drunk? Gaby, we're leaving. Let's go find your brothers. Mom, no, the piñata. Who said so? Nobody. Why are you telling lies? It was just a joke. Well, your jokes aren’t funny. Wait that’s my candy! Yes, but it’s nice to share... Run, Gabriela, run. Mom! Ok, we’re done. God, Lore, who says that? Lupita Ruiz Rincón, Marianita said so... She must've got so much money from the insurance. It’s like a movie. Let's change the subject. Antonio, stop hitting your brother! Every day is the same! Let’s break the piñata! What’s wrong? Mom, are we poor? Who told you that? Santiago and Sebas said we’re poor. That’s stupid. Mom, you said a bad word. Children! How was the party? Did you have fun? Toñis, are we poor? How could you say so, sweetie? Is that the one from your graduation? They're going to take everything... so get ready. I’m calling my mom, she can help out with tuition. It’s all the corrupt government’s fault. And fucking dollar Dollarchangers. Like your mom. So it’s my mom’s fault? Well, I guess she was the one who "told me" to marry you. ‘Sofia, Fernando’s a good man, from a very good family, a good catch, you should marry him.’ If not, what? You’d have married Pablo? That mediocre classless fuck. Classless fuck? Calm down, will you. Don’t tell me to calm down. Don’t you think I didn’t realize you weren’t a virgin? You should be thanking me. I pretended not to notice You’re such an asshole. What did you say? You’re an asshole. And you’re a fucking slut. Fuck, I miss my dad so much. Julio Iglesias singing: "I ran so much through life... I forgot that life is lived in a moment... I wanted to be first... but I forgot how to live... and about the small details." The president has announced the most dramatic news in Mexican history: he has nationalized the banks... –To those not yet nationalized... let’s give them one month. September. Independence Month... to meditate on their loyalty. Then we will act. It seemed he could not longer keep reading, especially when referring to the poor. I have asked for your pardon. I am carrying this responsibility... Sir! They're looking for you! They’re coming to take the car... Good Afternoon. Who is it? It’s Sofia Come on in. Thank you. Mrs. Sofía? Come in, you’ll catch a cold. Please give this to Señora Ana Paula, from Sofía. It’s not here. Yeah, right. Fer, it was back there on the left. I told you not to give me directions. I remember perfectly, Sofia. I can’t say anything. You don't remember. You don't listen. Why are you in a bad mood? I’m not in a bad mood. It’s annoying when you don't listen. I’m not going to listen when you talk to me like that. You’ve been doing that for days. Thanks. Your ticket, sir. Your keys? They're in there. We’re so late, so late. Calm down. Wait for me. You know that joke about the Banker’s club? No. How does it go? It’s now called Memory Lane. You’re terrible! It’s a good one. It’s a good one. Thank you, that’s fine. How’s it going with Joaquin? Good, he’s a good guy. How are you doing? Well, well. Adapting to our apartment. You know, it can be tough at first... but he’s good at what he does. You’ll learn so much. I’m full. Dessert anyone? Yes, please! The desserts are so wonderful here. What’s that one called? Carlota? I love that one. No thank you, not for me. What are you getting, beautiful? Guess! Crème Brulée and a cappuccino. Do you ant something Sofia? I’m fine thank you. We could get you a cake and sing happy birthday. No! Please, no! Let us celebrate you please, woman. Fernando, tell her. Sofia, my love. Ok, a little cake, but let's share. Of course Crème Brulée and a birthday cake. Another one for me. And a cappuccino please. She’s coming, she’s coming! We’re going to sing happy birthday Oh no, no, no! It’s not a birthday if we don't sing! Let’s have a toast instead! Cheers! Thank you so much. Lopez Portillo. Look who it is! The dog who was going to watch over our pesos! They say people are barking at him in restaurants. Really? Get out of here, you dog! Get out of here! Thief!
