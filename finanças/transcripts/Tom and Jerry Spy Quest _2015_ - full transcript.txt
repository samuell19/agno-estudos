That's my boy. Spike, come here, boy. - Hey! - Watch it! - What's the deal? - Masher. Hey, get back here. Oh! Mama, Mama. Look! That's great, honey. Hey, I'm sorry. He didn't mean any harm. It would seem that Bandit is not a big fan of cats. Come on, Bandit. It's getting late. We have to get back to Quest Key with the supplies. What are those? Hold on. Jeepers! Let's get outta here. Let's go. Hey, look. What are they after? I think they're after us. Wow! Go, cat. Go. Incoming! Come on, we've gotta get back to the hydrofoil. Hey, wait up. Mama, look. - Sorry about that. - Sorry. Let Mama finish this chapter. Ahhh! Hoop flares? They don't know that, Hadji. I do not think they care. Well, that didn't work. Race! Quick, boys, get on. You might wanna help your buddy. We would stay, but our ride is here. Who are these animals? They helped us, Race. Have you two ever been in a chase before? Hang on! Excellent throw, Jonny. Hey! Yeah! Impossible. Who is that amazing feline? - And... - Finished. What did you want to show me, Floyd? Oh! I give up! So, who's gonna tell the boss, Jonny Quest gave us the slip? Not me. I like living. Yeah. I like living, too. Long healthy life, collect a pension. Pension, definitely pension. Don't tell him. How's he gonna know? Because I know everything. I'll bet that Quest kid has coughed up hairballs more effective than you three. We can try again. No, no, no. You missed your opportunity. No. I wanted the boys for bait, and now it appears you have to go after the big fish himself. And woe to you, should you fail Dr. Zin again. Welcome to Quest Labs. Pretty cool, huh? - Hi, Dad. - Jonny. Thank goodness you're all right. Uh, yeah. Well... Well, we, uh... Should never wander off again. You know, boys, there are a lot of people who would like to get to me through you, which is why you have to stay close to Race. He's here to protect us. We could've handled it, with our new team. Yeah, the Five Musketeers. Or should I say four and a half? What are your new friends' names? Oh. Uh. Do you know, Hadji? Yes, yes. I believe so. Their names are Jerry and Thomas. Oh, so, you must be Jerry and you're Tom? Oh, you're Tom and you're Jerry! I kinda liked it better my way. Huh? Stand back, everyone. I'm going to activate the Q-sphere. Extraordinary. According to the Questometer, the Q-sphere has enough power to run a small city, indefinitely. Sure sounds like you solved the world's energy problems, Dad. Yes, but if someone evil were to get their hands on it, there is no telling the destruction they could cause. You're right, Hadji. But we mustn't let fear stand in the way of science. Or dinner for that matter. Who's hungry? I am. I can smell it from here. That's not dinner. No. Not that pot! Well, I'm definitely not in the mood for barbeque. Wow, Pop. This is delicious. Oh, don't thank me. Race did all the cooking. Any more for you, Hadji? Oh, no, thank you. I couldn't eat another bite. Those chicken wings were out of this world. Yeah, and how about the pasta? I gotta tell you, Race, that pasta was incredible! Where'd you get the recipe? Just a spicy little dish that another spicy little dish taught me, a long time ago. Mmm-hmm. Was she sweet, too? Uh. Yeah, she was... I mean, I mean, the dish was. I... Well, you know how women are. Uh, tiramisu anyone? I think we should all, ahem, turn in. Phew. I owe you one, Doc. That's quite all right, Race. You've saved me many times. Well, how 'bout it, team? Time for some shut-eye? Yeah, and Tom and Jerry can bunk with us. Off to bed, everyone. Let's go, Tom. Yeah, how are we gonna get inside? Many lasers. Lasers are very dangerous. Prone to accidents. Burn our tails. Yeah. We are gonna have to find a way to shut off the security system. Just like that. Thanks for leaving the door open, boys. You really shouldn't have. Ooh! Is that chicken paprika... Focus, doofus. We're here to steal that sphere and grab Dr. Quest. Ow. Stop him! That mouse will ruin everything. That ruthless mouse! Yeah, missed me. Hit me, but it didn't hurt. Ah, got a whole new look. Kitty Santa. Definitely Santa. Be nice, kitty. Oh. Oh, yeah. There it is. It's definitely the Q-sphere. Uh-oh! Robot arm. Definitely free. Got it. Yeah, that's right. Now, see, the baseball game's over. Ow. Ow. Definitely rolling. Got it. Uh, perhaps we should use the back door. Whoa! Hmm. It's the creeps from the beach. They're stealing the Q-sphere. Put it down, nice and easy. What? Stand back, Doctor. I've got him. Huh? Oh, no. Ooh, I'll take that. What's all the commotion? Argh! Dad! Stay back, boys. Hang on, Doctor. Not so fast, buckethead. Turn this bus around. Hey. Bye-bye, boys. Holy smoke, they got Dad and Race. But why did the security system not alert us? I understand why evil people would take the Q-sphere. But why take Dr. Quest? Because Dad is the only man on the planet who knows how to work it. With Race out of the picture, who will save Dr. Quest? We can save 'em, if we only knew where they went. Perhaps those robot creatures left some sort of energy trail. Ah, I doubt it. But the Q-sphere does. Good thinking, Hadji. I find meditation helps clear the mind. There! Somewhere in the tiny nation of Moldovistan. All right, Questketeers. To the Quest Jet. But Jonny, who is going to pilot? I am, I guess. All right, buckle up. Woo-hoo! Great take off, Jonny. I've seen Race do it 100 times. Landing, not so much. I see that you have secured the prisoners. Safe and sound. Yep, we locked them up good. Yes, but I am afraid Dr. Quest still refuses to cooperate. Ah, the fool. Yeah, I don't think he likes you. Not a fan. Definitely not a fan. Not wearing your T-shirt. Definitely no T-shirt. Perhaps we can find a way to motivate him. Yeah, definitely went on too long. Got to know when to quit. How close are we, Hadji? We are just off the coast of Moldovistan. The signal is coming from one of the islands. We have company, Jonny. Robot drone missiles. I'll shake 'em off. Done it a million times. You have? In the Quest simulator. Simulator? Hold tight. Hadji, get ready to hit the thrusters. A little farther. I am not certain there is any farther left. Jonny! Warning. Warning. Come on! - Come on! - Impact unavoidable. Now! Pull up, Jonny. Pull up! Pull up! Collision avoided. Phew! I don't like the sound of that. Hang on, guys. - Abandon ship. - Good idea. Hang on, guys. Gotcha! Not so tight, Tom. I can't reach the rip cord. Race is gonna go through the roof. Look on the bright side. Now you do not have to land it. Where are we? Hey! There's the answer. Oh, Moldovistan. We actually made it. Let's head for the city. My, my, my. So it was Jonny Quest who was flying the jet. Clever boy. No doubt he was aided by that magnificent cat. Look how he's ready for danger at every turn. He ain't so tough. What was that? Nothing, boss, uh, Doc. Doctor. Dr. Zin, sir. Bandit. Come here, boy. The tracker says the Q-sphere is still on the island. How do we get there? We have no money. Don't worry. We have an old friend who lives here. Yes, Dr. Zin. Understood. We must bring the boys to Zin. Alive! And the animals? Uh, they are expendable. But be careful of that cat. He's diabolically clever. Hey, quit horsing around. - Which way, Jonny? - I don't know. Last time I was here, I was just a kid. Hey! Jonny, look out. Watch out, Hadji. Oh! The noose tightens. Argh! Come on! Get off me. Argh! Uh-oh. Wrong way. I have an idea. Everybody up. Time to make like a banana and split. Stop them! Follow them! Whoa! I am truly sorry for this. It's locked. Hurry, you fools! Jonny, we do not have much time. My, my, look what the cat dragged in. Jezebel Jade? Just the person we've been looking for. But, Jonny, is she not a mercenary who works for the highest bidder? Let's debate morality later, boys. Inside, now. Better get downstairs. You too, mopsy. Where does this door lead? I think to there. Eyes this way, boys. Nice place, Miss Jade. Yes, very artistic. It ain't Carnegie Hall, but it's paid for. We sure are glad to see you, Miss Jade. Cut to the chase, kiddo. We really need your help. Race and my dad have been captured and we're here to rescue 'em. Well, I hope you like foster care, kid, 'cause Dr. Zin has 'em. Dr. Zin? How do you know? You forget. Information is my business. Dr. Zin has been after my dad's research. You have got to help us. Sure, make me an offer. I don't see any collateral, so I'll settle for cash. But this could endanger the world. Jezebel Jade sticks her neck out for no one. Even Race? Especially Race. I thought you liked him. Oh, we had a little something once. But, apparently, once was enough for him. Now, if you'll excuse me, boys, I've got a show to do. Too bad, Miss Jade. Could have been a pretty sweet deal for you. Right, Hadji? Oh, uh, yes. Very sweet, like honey. Deal? What deal? Dad was working on a top-secret project for the government. I bet they'd pay plenty to get it back. But if you'd rather pass on a fat reward... On second thought, boys, you may have touched my heart after all. Jezebel Jade is open for business. There's a skimmer down in the garage. That should get you to the island. Thanks, Miss Jade. Whoa! Hold your horses. This isn't free. Sign here. I expect your father, or the government, to pay me for the rental of my equipment, in case of your demise. You drive a hard bargain, Miss Jade. But Race always said you were the smartest lady he knew. He called me a lady? Five minutes, Miss Jade. Break a leg. You can leave from downstairs. Just don't make a racket. Come on. There it is. I will open the door. - There they are! - Uh-oh. We gotta move. Don't let them get away. Look out! * In the heart of the city * Dwells the lady who's known as Jade * Powerful Bold and pretty * She's a girl who's got it made * Oh, I don't need no man * Independent and full of pride * I'm a gal with a plan * It don't include being * Some man's bride * I'm all business no pleasure * And I know what men desire * For they seek pomp and treasure * The highest bidder is the buyer * Oh, I don't heed * Heed no man * Oh, I don't need * Need no man * But man, oh, man * Oh, man, oh, man * Oh, man, oh, man * Do I need you * Do I need you * Mercenary species * But my heart is not for sale * Hard and broken in pieces * Thank a tall, tan action male * In the heart of the city * Dwells the lady who's known as Jade * Lonely, loveless, a pity * I'm a girl that * Love betrayed * Man, oh, man, oh, man * Do I need you * Man, oh, man, oh, man * Do I need you Wonderful. Wonderful. Bravo. Add the damage to their tab. Yes, Miss Jade. Dr. Zin's island is dead ahead. Shake a leg, guys. Come on, Questketeers. There's no time to fool around. Okay, boy, down you go. You okay? I think he likes it. We'll fly halfway up the volcano to get a better look at the island. Okay, let's go. So, you think Zin noticed? Highly likely. Dinner is served. Ugh, fish sticks again? This is the third time this week! I hate fish sticks! Ah, Dr. Quest. I told you, Zin. I'll never help you access the power of the Q-sphere. Oh, trust me, I have ways to convince you. Hey! Ugh. - Dad! - Dr. Quest! Jonny, Hadji, how did you get here? Ah, such an affectionate display of family devotion. Oh, boy, it would warm my heart, if I had one. What do you want, Zin? All you have to do, Dr. Quest, is to wire the sphere to the island's energy system. Now, once that is completed, I'll return the boys to you, safe and sound. But try any trickery and I'll deliver them to you a little bit on the crispy side. Don't do it, Dad. I have no choice, Jonny. I can't let any harm come to you and Hadji. Oh! Take the boys to their cell and make sure you find that cat. Nothing is safe around here until that devious feline is dispatched. I want him shot on sight. Bang! I have to admit, I'm amazed you boys got this far. But I wish you hadn't. Titanium steel. Believe me, I've tried to bend it. I just hope this floor does not crack. So much for digging a tunnel. Hey, what about up there? That's just a ventilator. Even if we could reach it, it's too small to fit through. Bandit, you're just about the right size. Hadji, you think you can still do your levitation trick? It is no trick, Sahib Race. Sim sim salabim. Good boy. Now go find Tom and Jerry. Uh-oh, is this on? We're live? You could have said something. Welcome to the Zin Automated Battle Island. Hello. Hello, out there. Thanks to space-age technology, this mobile fortress of destruction is powerful enough to bring any country of your own choosing to its knees! And all for a reasonable price. So it was Jade who got you here? She helped. Did, uh, she mention me, by any chance? Oh, yeah. That bad, huh? I think she still likes you, Race. In a scary kind of way. I can't blame her. It's what happens, boys, when you put business in front of other people's feelings. I guess I messed things up big time. I know the feeling. Sorry I got you into this, Hadji. If I had to do it all over again, I would still be here. Thanks. But, like my dad says, sometimes I bite off more than I can chew. Don't beat yourself up, Jonny. You too, Hadji. I'm proud of you both. Yeah? Absolutely. What other boys would have had the courage and resourcefulness to travel across continents to track us down in the middle of a volcano? Gee, thanks, Race. As a matter of fact, when we get back to the Keys, how about some flying lessons, in the jet? Yeah, the jet... I hope you're not considering any delaying tactics, Dr. Quest. On the contrary, Zin, the Q-sphere is now fully installed. At last! Bring him up. May I see my son now? First, we must test the sphere. Because if it doesn't work, you'll be seeing your son in the crab pit. Fish sticks ain't good enough for you? No, course not. No, no, no. You're a big-time doctor. Huh, yeah. Well, doctor of what, hey? Ha! Hey, ain't you supposed to be upstairs? Then you can take this up to his royal butt-head. And stay out of the catnip! Can you feel it, Dr. Quest? It's the power of my intellect being unleashed. That's funny. It sounds like my Q-sphere. Isn't that just like you, Benton? Denying my brilliance. Even when we were freshmen at the university, you were jealous of my superior genius. All you had was a genius for destruction. I did not burn down the chemistry lab. It was never proven. What about the explosion at the super collider? A little cloud of radiation. I don't know why they got so huffy about it. I was the one who lost his hair. My long, beautiful, silky hair with its natural bounciness. They had to evacuate the city, Zin. It really is too bad, Dr. Quest. We could have been quite a team, you and I. We could have ruled the world! Instead, that glory will be all mine. You might have saved us all the trouble by inventing a decent hair restorer. What's happening, Race? Looks like Zin's plan is gonna bring the roof down on us. I'm more worried about the floor. Up here, boys. Ugh, crabs. Always hated crabs. Help! Not on my watch. Bandit! And he brought Tom and Jerry. Can they get us out of here? If you're gonna rescue us now would be a good time. We're waiting. Now! Well done, guys. Tom. Jonny, watch out! Bandit! Let's go. Phew. Behold, Dr. Quest, my triumph is at hand. Incredible. Race, we're headed for the edge. Hang on, boys. I can't stop. Oh, no, Hadji! - Race. - Gotcha. Hadji. - And I've got you. - That was close. Couldn't forget about you. Gotcha. Whoa! Oh, no. You're slipping! No! Not again. Where exactly are you taking us, Zin? Home, Dr. Quest. While you were tinkering with your little sphere, I devised the means to harness its energy to create the greatest, most glorious warship the world has ever seen. Watch out, drone ahead. I'll need a distraction. Hmm. Tom can do it. Well, in that suit, he'll think you're one of Zin's cats. Identify yourself. Your worst shutdown. Talk about an instant junkyard. When did we get this communique? Just moments ago, Mr. President. It went to all the world's leaders. You're sure it's from Zin? Yes, sir. That's his signature smiley face at the end of the threat. Can we stop him? We're trying to locate him now. But apparently his airship has been cloaked from radar. Perhaps we should bring in Dr. Benton Quest. We would, if we could find him. Fifteen minutes, Dr. Quest, the time it takes to cook a frozen pizza. It's all the time your nation has left. You guys stay back, I'm gonna get your father. Oopsie daisy. Hadji, we have to shut down the Q-sphere. Can you handle the crane? Yes, I am quite good at lifting things. We're ready when you are, Jonny. Ready. Ready as I'll ever be. You guys stand guard, okay? Looking good, Jonny. You're almost there. Ah, nothing goes better with a military bombardment than a hot cup of Chai tea. Ugh! Milk? Huh? What? Race Bannon? And the cat! Leave Bannon to the drones, you must protect the sphere from that hateful cat. Knock, knock. Here we come. What? Hey, it's that Quest kid. You guys get the cat and I'll take care of the brat. Whoa! Uh, Hadji? I am on it. Whoa! Boys, I need a little help down here. You got it, help is on the way. Yeah, yeah. Help on the way. We're the help. Ha-ha. Whoa! You're going the wrong way. Where're you going, buddy boy? He really was nothing but a scaredy cat. Yeah, a real coward. Definitely yellow. Yellow like a dandelion. - Yeah. - One down, four to go. Jerry. Gotcha. Whoa. Five minutes, Dr. Quest. I can almost taste the pepperoni and mushrooms. Yum, yum, yum. You're one sick, twisted individual, Zin. Phew. There. Just a couple more. Oh yeah? You think so, huh? Well, how 'bout we blow your crane down? Huh? Bandit, no. No! Aw, gee, too bad, kid. Watch out, Hadji. Well, this is one way to kill two birds with one stone, huh? Jonny, look out! Yeah! Hold on, Jerry. Huh? Whoa, nice flying, Tom. You take the kid. I get the dog. Huh? Well, well, this little reunion will make it easier to take care of you all in one fell swoop. Cut 'em down to size, boys. Definitely one of the boys, one of the gang. Yeah. You should've quit while you were ahead, kitty cat. Yeah, cut it down to size. Come on, Hadji, now's our chance. Whoa! Whoa! Jump! What now? No! You have bested me, feline. - Dad. - Dr. Quest. Jonny. Hadji. Your magnificent cat may have won this battle. But even without the sphere, this island has enough energy to reach the coast and crash. Happy landing, Dr. Quest. - What? - Car's full, Doc. Try the next one. That's my escape pod. Not yours. Why did I ever make henchmen out of cats? We've located Zin's airship, Mr. President. But I'm afraid it's too late, he's too close. Uh, then it's going to take a miracle to save this city. Dad, Tom and Jerry know where the skimmer is. We can use that to escape. Good thinking, Jonny. But we can't take a chance on this island hitting the capital. What are you doing? I knew that someday I might fall into enemy hands, so I created a failsafe missile that hones in on my watch to prevent my work from being used for evil. It's activated, let's get out of here. And on top of that, the Washington Monument has 900 steps, a two-ton capstone, 30,000 marble blocks... And Titan III rocket boosters? Shouldn't I have known about that? We're cut off. Maybe there's a way we can go around. We don't have time. I will levitate Jerry to the other side and he can bring the skimmer to us. Ahhh! I'm sorry, boys, I'm afraid this is it. Never send a mouse to do a man's job. Or a woman's. Miss Jade! But how? I followed you. I had to protect my investment. We even saved your little ball. Jump, Race. Jezebel, you're a sight for sore eyes. Yes, yes, I am. Uh, can we go now? We'd better. And as we reconstruct the Washington Monument with the original stones we retrieved from the ocean, we are proud to honor these brave and ingenious heroes with the distinguished medal for bravery and ingenuity. - Bravo. Bravo. - Huh? Cool, uh, I mean... Thanks, Mr. President. You know, Jonny, you remind me of myself at your age. Easy, boy. Oh, and we even had a special one made for you, Mr. Mouse. Whoa. Whoa. I don't remember this in the program.
