Snow and Fire PARIS FIGHTS FOR IT'S FREEDOM On the 6th of June, 1944 the allies landed in Normandy On the 18th of August, Paris was uprising Teenagers were participating in the battle, spontaneously. Many of these young people wanted to join the regular army... to liberate the Vosges, Lorraine, and Alsace... ...and return the French army to its place among the Allies. This film recounts the story of those youngsters... ...who entered a long winter of Snow and Fire. Paris, August 19, 1944 We entered the war as if we were starting kindergarten. Don't just stand there... Come and help us! Quickly! There's hardly any pulse. Prepare a caffeine shot, and a compression bandage. There's shooting in Saint-Paul St. Don't stand there! He'll die, if we leave him like this. I couldn't reach the hospital. I can go... I have my bike. I can't see anything. They've cut the power. He's dead. The ambulance is here. What's your name? There's a theater in the next street. Maybe they have some candles. Thanks. Coffee? Like a juice? I'm worn out. Go and take a rest, there are showers upstairs. You can slap me... I just couldn't resist doing it. - Careful at the intersection! - Watch out! Michel! What are you doing here? Jacques! Quick! Get the machine-gun! You're crazy to be riding around like that. Your mum would be furious! Don't be silly. Pierre, there's more sand coming! There's more sand! Here's the truck. Where the hell's that damned machine gun? Cover me! Where's he going? Take care of the driver. Good on you, Jacques! - I was scared. - So was I. Line up! Get to work! Stand to attention! Good! Taking the town hall from a bunch of clerks wasn't exactly Austerlitz... Defending against two SS panzer divisions... ...is likely to be a little more difficult. They'll be in Paris tonight... That is, if our information's correct. If anyone wants to drop out... ...right now is the time to do it. - The Republican Guard? - At Kosciusko. At ease! Your men to the doorways and windows fronting Rivoli... A frontal attack is expected. - Is Stephane up there? - He is at the prefecture. Good. You take over. Single file! Follow me, on the double! Forward march! We found hundreds of these at the Bazaar. All right, leave them with me. And you address me as Sir, right? Yes, Sir. She's the most beautiful girl that I've ever seen. More beautiful than Amelie? Are you kidding me? Amelie was as flat as a flounder. She was 7 years old. But you stole her from me. I was 9, boyo... You didn't have a chance. It wasn't the first time? Just wait for the second! There won't be a second time. It'll be "her". I love her, I respect her. She gave herself showing generosity. Nurses are a generous lot. I HAVE to see her again! - She must never think that... - She was seduced and abandoned? Yes... She's the woman of my life. I'm very serious. Michel, you can't judge, based on one night. You can judge the arse, but not what's in the head. Even the arse, in one night... You've got a dirty mind. It's funny with the upper classes... Your vulgarity is an affectation. Let alone the hoi polloi. Why didn't you come back for 2 years? My mother worried. Mine, not at all. Did you get your matric? - Last year. - And since? I was in hiding. I don't know anything about her. "She vanished with the breaking dawn. " Cease fire! Cease fire! For God's sake, cease fire! Let me past... Out of the way! It's HER! Don't stay here... there are two tanks on Rivoli. Get hold of their weapons... Let's go! There are tanks on Rivoli St! Take off his clothes. - Doctor! - An emergency, a hemorrhage. Christiane? - She's not here. - Do you have her address? - Can you give it to me? - Yes. Hello? What's happening? Who? Hang on! Who is Bidault? They're waiting for you. Hurry! De Gaulle is in Rambouillet. De Gaulle is in Rambouillet. General Leclerc is at Croix-de-Berny station. The first French tanks... ...have crossed the Seine at the Austerlitz bridge. They're coming! France! Paris is liberated! It has freed itself... ...from a retreating enemy. - 5 days without calling! - I'm with the Resistance. I'm enlisted. Enlisted? We took the town hall, 10 of us were in a truck... ...and I helped to fix injured people. Did you lie about your age? Got to go... Last call is at 11 o'clock. - You're not sleeping here? - No, we sleep with the battalion. Don't you worry. You think I won't worry? You've got a cheek! - Do you get anything to eat? - Yes! Plenty! Even chocolate. Enlisted... enlisted? But it's all over. Paris is free. It's finished! But Mum, France hasn't been liberated yet. Dad's still a prisoner. I'm going there... going to Germany. Your pajamas are in the dresser. We formed a battalion... I'm going there, on the front line. But you have to tell them that you're too young! I'm off! Guess who I've run into? Jacques! Young Senechal? He sends his love. He's terrific. He's already killed two Krauts. C'mon... Don't you worry! Michel! If there's fighting at the front, stay out of it! Come on, Catherine. Requisition, damn it! You're supply officers! I've got 300 mouths to feed. Is the equipment there? I've asked Colonel Roll for it. We depend on De Gaulle. Sort it out. We need guidance. How many sergeants are there? - Two. - Proper ones? From the Resistance. You were in the infantry? - Artillery. - You? Ballooner, Captain. Don't we have any NCOs? Well, there's one, but... - But what? - There's Hans, an Alsatian. He was a corporal in the French army, then a corporal in the Wehrmacht. Where is he? In the cellar with the prisoners. You're a champ. Let's go find him. The battalion-strength report, Captain. 100 from national teams, 50 students... some from Resistance, draft-dodgers... ...some Bretons, and even a Tahitian. - Average age? - 18. But they're keen to go. Appoint the oldest of them responsible. Here's the prisoner, Captain. Show him in. What rank? Corporal 1st class, in the French army. 2nd class in Germany. Do you know how to sew? Bingo...! Now you're a French sergeant. Take these raw recruits and make soldiers out of them. On your way! Give me those stripes. Stand at attention! What's the matter with you? I'm a sergeant. No kidding! - Will I sew them on for you? - Leave it. - Lilette will take care of it. - Lilette? I've been living with her for 2 years. In love? We haven't had sex in 3 months Maybe more. Living with her for 2 years... What did you get out of it? She's not so young any more. It's good for her, and me too. How old? 25. 25!? Well, mine is all of 19. - So you found yours? - Yeah. Her name's Christiane Mercier. Her girl-friend fixed me a meeting. As you see, I cough more. Senechal! A young girl's asking for you. Put-upon again! I'm surprised... This is the time she dances the cancan. You awake? Fuck him! He's a cradle-snatcher! It's his sister. Attention, blank shots, no closer than 3 metres. Little Jean, I got you, you're dead. Come back down. No, I was behind the rock. Rubbish! I got you full in the face...! Back off, damn it! Like this? Scram, or I'll toss a grenade! Go to hell! You're surrounded. I'll throw it on three. One! Two! Three! Cease fire! Who threw that, for God's sake?! I did. Chasseur Michel Fournier. You get 4 days! - But... - 8 days! - You letting me go? - Go to hell! Is Fournier there? Yes, sergeant. Michel! You get out tomorrow. But I've got a date with her this evening. Let me out of here right now. You're a sergeant, aren't you? I can't. The battalion is confined to barracks. Standing up to a chick isn't... I've waited 2 weeks... I want to see her! She'll be expecting me. I don't have her phone number. She'll never want to see me again. I'm going to try to let her know. You'll do that for me? Jacques... you won't steal her from me? Whereabouts is it? I'll be two minutes. It's okay with your mother... We can go out. Great! - Can we go to the movies? - If you like. Christiane Mercier? Yes. I've come on behalf of Michel. He's in jail. In jail? Only for tonight. It's not serious. The army! He's in the army? If it's okay with you, same time tomorrow, here. No, I'll be working tomorrow. I came to tell him... You're his friend? Yes, for 10 years. Sit down. Come on! Schoolmates? We lived in the same building. Our families were neighbours. Can you tell him something, for me? - Tell him... - Well, well...! Lilette Van Dam, Mireille Leduc. Christiane Mercier. Sit down, we're eating here. Here? It's a long way from the theatre, and we have to change. They're in a hurry. Can we order? You're in a hurry, too. - I'm going home. - Oh no, why? I have 3 whiting left, with ration cards... 2 Basque chickens and swede turnips. Fine. We all have star-signs and an ascendant. I was born in March... ...and I'm Pisces, ascendant Capricorn. I'm born in September. September? You're Virgo. and, Lilette... Listen... "Uncompromising, exclusive, sentimental... "Virgos believe in passionate love. " Do you believe in passionate love? Not really. Ask your parents what time you were born. I don't ask my parents anything. Not even the time? - They're dead. - Both of them? I don't want to talk about it. This Michel... is he your lover? He's a kid. How old is he? He's the proper, idealistic type. He's not a kid at all. Idealistic, proper, not a kid? It didn't stop you having sex with him. Jacques! I'm glad I slept with him. I spent part of the night with the dead... with corpses. And the rest, with a sweet guy who made love to me. What's it to you? Women bother me who make fun of men by calling them children. "Women"?... "Men"?... You classify, you specify. You call us "chicks" and "birds". Is your sign "Bourgeois" ascendant "Boor"? And yours, "Bitch" ascendant "Suffragette"? We'll be on our way. Come on, Mireille. You aren't coming to see the show? Come on now! A start like that ends up either in blood or in bed. - The bill, please - Yes, Sir. Christiane, I don't know what you want to say to Michel... ...but you tell him yourself. I don't come back without another date. It was just an impromptu event with Michel. I want to be free, to laugh, to dance, to love. Do you think that's bad? Do I seem to? You can reach me at this number. Are you faithful in love? No. Well, 'til we meet again. This is yours? Can I drop you off? I live close by. That's alright. It's not this way. - Can I drive? - What? Could I drive? No. We're there... it's number 3. How do I stop? Brake. On the right! Disengage the clutch on the left. It's not stopping. Goodnight. Goodnight. Distribute that. Each of you get your stuff. Be back together in 20 minutes. - There are no straps. - Work something out! Quiet, damn it! On your feet, Fournier. You're out. - What's going on? - Leaving in an hour. Move it! Give me some for Michel. Can we be going to the front? In the middle of the night? Why do we have to be quiet? How's it going? Maybe it's because of planes that we're leaving at night. We don't tell our parents? - What's going on, guys? - Shh! I've prepared your kit. Have you seen Senechal? Move it! Hans, shut them up. I don't want to hear anything. What the hell have you been doing? Cartier's been looking for you since 10 this morning. What's going on? We're going to the front. - In secret? - We're joining de Lattre. - And then? - And then?! They want us to be part of the FTP Resistance group. ...and then we desert. - Desert? So we're to fight? - That's right. We follow de Gaulle. I'm fine with obeying a general. Eyes left! Get in line! In silence. Line up in silence. Eyes front! Stand at ease! Battalion. At my command... Atten-shun! Backpacks! Packs closed, damn it! - There are no straps. - Backpacks! - Backpack! - Where were you? I'll use my tie. You? My braces. Get them under way. Very good, Captain. Sling arms! First platoon, forward, march! Damn it! I'm losing my pants. What am I going to tell them at the FTP? You can tell them that I'm quitting. After 4 years with de Gaulle, I'm not fighting with a commie outfit. You'll let them be killed... They're not ready. They'll be ready. Come on! - How did you find her? - Very well. Not bad. You get another date with her? She gave me that. Her telephone number. She gave it to you for me. Did you tell her that I love her? That I'm serious? Michel, there are thousands and thousands of girls. All chicks? Not at all! We're finally on our way, to fight... We're gonna kiss, we're gonna screw, we're gonna live, damn it! And maybe die. Come on, everybody off! Quickly! Move it! Schnell! Enough with the "Schnell" Hans! Leave your kits on the trucks! Hurry up! Assemble in columns of 8! Atten-shun! At my command... Present... arms! Order... arms! Volunteers to be parachute troops, take one step forward. Battalion... At my command... One step forward... march! Are we going to be parachutists? I get vertigo. There you are. - Er... - Yes?! I have to pass my matric this year. - Name? - Bonnard. My parents don't... You're going home to them. Right now? Right now. This is MY spot. Get fucked. - Don't forget he's a corporal. - So he can get fucked. It's brand new... There are still labels. There's even toothpaste. What is it? It's written in American. For shaving. You don't need it. Cut it out! Are we going to see snow? I'm sure. Are we gonna parachute? You won't be qualified any time soon. Is this how it's supposed to be? No way! There you are, pin-head. Forget about regular-army grades. Equivalent grades... Only equivalent grades are supported. I did have 3, now I have 2. It's no laughing matter! You did say "Captain"... Now you'll say "Lieutenant". The battalion will be shared out amongst the regiment. You'll be mixing with veteran soldiers. Soon... Soon you'll be marching past Commander Faure. I do not want to see any choir-boys... ...boy-scouts, or majorettes. I want to show them that young Parisians have balls... and that they are ready to fight... ...to return France to its rank amongst the Allies. I want to see the faces of volunteers... ...that are determined. I want expressions of steel... ...turned proudly towards your new officers. Have you understood me? Eyes... left! Eyes... front! Section... halt! Fall out! Goodnight, Fatso... We'll bring you a hot-water bottle. One with two big tits! It's Mummy that big baby wants? Someone to put you to sleepy-byes? Fuck off! You're such a cutie! You won't be such big-shots tomorrow! - Good night. - Bunch of degenerates! Can I make a phone call? Thanks. I've enough money. Three beers, please. How many fucks have YOU had? Why do you keep asking me? - For Paris? What number? - Montmartre 3842. What will it be? - A glass of milk. - Milk? Grenadine. In 10 minutes. Thank you, ma'am. Who's the girl in yellow? That's the "lady of the manor". I love "Amor, amor". Like to dance? Want to dance? My feet are sore. "Amor, amor", miss? Sure. Ten minutes delay. You've made a hit. She looks Becassine, in the comic-strip. - Is that mine? - I'll see. It's Paris. In the call-box under the stairs. Don't go. Miss Mercier, please. Christiane! Phone for you! You're not from here. No, I'm from Besan?on. Not far from here. Like to dance? Love to. In Tahiti, they dance like this. Hello? Christiane! It's Michel. It's me, Michel. Where are you? In the mountains, near the Swiss border. It's hard to hear you with this music. I wanted to talk as friends. That OK? If you wish, Michel, my pet. I didn't just call to... Did your friend leave with you? He's here, flirting with Becassine. We're parachutists. Yes, both of us. Did you get my letters? Have I jumped? No, not yet. Christiane, I wanted to ask you... ...to be my wartime penfriend. Sure. What is is it I have to do? Reply to my letters. I'd like a photo of you. I won't show it to anyone. or maybe to everyone, and say "Do you realise...!" "This is the girl that I've... "... that I love. " I'm perfectly serious! Shit! I've been cut off! I have her. She'll be my wartime penfriend. Everybody up! It's 6 o'clock! Get moving! So this is the job! Can't just wake up any longer. Bunch of good-time-charlies! It's 6 o'clock, you layabouts! Come on, get a move on! 12.05! The jerks, the jerks! Oh no, the jerks! The stupid jerks! Fuck it! Quiet, damn it! Watch out for mines. Follow the beacons. Senechal! Pouldu! - Milk? - Yeah. Something moved. We're hunting Krauts, not rabbits. Hey, guys... Spoils of war! Yeah! Fleury! Do I know him? - From around here? - Any of your business? Well, do you know who it is? I think I'd prefer the haberdasher on the Rue des Abbesses. Have you spoken to the father about it? He's a kid. I'm not going to have a kid, by a kid. I'm not going to involve him. This is my first time. It's serious, I risk getting into serious shit. I know. I don't know what I'd do, if it happened to me. - Stop preaching. - I'm not preaching to you. I'm not going to be a teenage mother. We've been deprived of everything for 4 years. It's not a time to get trapped. I won't trade my cigarettes for milk. Yes, but if you were in love... My friend Nadine met an American. Both her father, and the American's are pastors. She says that's a sign of fate. She doesn't speak English, and doesn't dream of America. I find Parisians to be hypocritical and selfish. They've forgotten everything, except that they were hungry. We were always hungry. And that they were afraid, because we're still afraid. They no longer want to hear about the war anymore. In 'Le Figaro', General de Gaulle is indignant. "Talk about our army", he said... "Our soldiers need to feel supported. " He'd been told that the armed forces were no longer of interest. - That's nice! - Does it surprise you? - Read some more. - No, that part's private. Michel, your letters are upsetting. I can't stop myself from being afraid for all of you... .. so near, and yet so far away. I hope my letters are breaths of this air of freedom in Paris... ...which you defend so dearly. Your wartime penfriend, Christiane. P.S. Is your friend Jacques with you? - Can I put it in your pack? - Sure. I'll get it back, on leave. Every 20 seconds. The German 88s. Harassment fire. If you get to hear it, it wasn't for you. And if it WAS for me? You never hear it. She's in love. - Your 'lady of the manor'? - Yeah. Fournier, Pouldu, you're wanted at the aid station. I have a hard time answering her. You write all the time. This must be it. What do you want to say to her? That I love her. That I want a photo of her. That I want to make a date with her. - Can you help me? - Yeah. - 2nd class Fournier. - 2nd class Pouldu. At ease. Out of here! Fournier... have you done First Aid? Get undressed. Get undressed! In the Scouts, when I was 12. - And during the uprising? - Stretcher-bearer. You'll replace Fleury. - Captain... - Yes? I'm here to fight. Don't worry, you'll fight. Sulfonamides... Kocher forceps, to clamp blood-vessels... Kramer splints... tourniquets, tincture of iodine... dressings, tetanus serum... syringe of morphine... and your blue pad. OK? I said get undressed! It's in English. Write your diagnosis in French and affix it to the injured person. The diagnosis? Good, come here. Priority 1... Neck wound with suffocation. Priority 2... vascular injury. Put on a tourniquet. Priority 3... the stomach. A burst of shrapnel entered there. You write... Deep abdomen wound. Evacuation requested. And what do I do? If the intestines are out, you put them back in. You bandage it up and give a shot of morphine. Finally the head. A bullet goes in there, you write... "Frontal bullet to brain apparent. " Evacuation? Useless. The casualty evacuation- team has other things to do. A shot of morphine, if the guy can talk. OK? Seton wound with fracture of the humerus. Of the what? The humerus is that bone, there. Sulfa drugs, clean the wound, apply splints... iodine tincture and dressing. - Morphine if... - If the guy's conscious. In case of hemorrhage, you mention if an artery has been cut. How do you tell if it's an artery? For details, see Adjutant Valentin. Captain...! You'll start practical training tomorrow. Pouldu, you'll be stretcher-bearer. Get dressed, old man. Alright, we'll start from scratch. What's that? Commander Lestrade doesn't want to follow the maneuvre. What the hell is this? We attack in 5 minutes. We need armoured support. There are two Tigers in the woods. I'm not advancing my tanks. We'd be destroyed. Fucking hell! My guys have got no cover! I lost 5 tanks like this, yesterday. No question of moving forward. We attack in 3 minutes. The bazookas with me. Bazookas follow the Captain. To all of 22... Fire at my command. I have the hiccups. Scare me! Get ready to attack! Forward! I'm hurt! My leg! Don't worry, it'll be alright. Don't worry, we're here. Sulfa, eight. Fuck it, do something! - Medic! - Yes, I'm coming! My foot! I'm gonna die! Lil' Jean? Lil' Jean! Mummy! Mummy! Mummy! Fournier! Come on! Lil' John! Extend your fucking range! We're getting hit here! What are you doing? Working for the Krauts?! Call Lestrade, the tanks are destroyed. He can move forward. This is Sanglier 250, over. What is it, Michel? What have I got? Where does it hurt? It's spinning. It's nothing? You are so lucky! Regroup the men to attack the village. That's good. Has to be sent out tomorrow. Special flight. We planned to mix it for Thursday. - Work it out. - It's too late. Any others mixed by tonight? Absolutely. Get them off right away. Yes, that's taken care of, Sir. David and I are heading back east. I was asked by Knight for a GI Christmas. This is classified stuff, you know. Nice work, boys. - Thank you Sir. - Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Tourist Service... What can I do for you? Nadine, this is David my cameraman, I told you about him. - Hi. - Hello. Well, shall we go? Christiane! Chocolate, jam, Christmas turkey. You'll have a good time. Franck. Hi. - David. - Hi. Dan, my friend. You look like a present. Let's go. He said you look like a gift. I have a leave pass. I'm going with them. We're spending Christmas together. What about you? - Where are you going? - Alsace. - Where are we going, Frank? - We go eat. In this?! It's beautiful! We go to Saverne... Want to come with us? - Saverne? - Yes, Saverne. "Saverne", Nadine. That's where they are. What's your name again? Christiane. Come with us, Chris. Yes, come with us! Yes! Chocolate, jam and Christmas turkey. - Satisfied? - Sure. You'll enjoy it. Where's Mum's old leather bag? Where are you going? Here it is. To Alsace. Do you mind, Grandpa? To Alsace! What about New Years Eve? In Alsace, with some Americans. There's war going on... It's dangerous. Not at Saverne, Grandma. It's not at the front. "You are my strength, my courage, my talisman... " "My shield against bullets, my antidote to fear. " Little spy! Your Michel, Saverne, "December 20, 1944." Do you have a balaclava? There's snow. Don't you worry. Love you. I'll be there in 2 days 'Bye, brat! Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Oh, chocolate! How about some music? - David? - No thanks. - Are you with the 1st R.C.P.? - Yes, Miss. Do you know Senechal and Fournier? They shouldn't be far away. Fournier is at Midnight Mass. And Senechal? He'd be around here somewhere. Midnight, Christians... It is the solemn hour Where God-as-man came down to us The whole world trembles in expectation on this night Who gives to him, the Savior People on your knees wait for you deliverance! Noel...! Noel...! Here is... ...The Redeemer... Noel...! Noel...! Here is... The Redeemer. I don't believe it! Did you come to see me? I came to spend New Years Eve with you. Here it is. Not ready yet? I'm going to have to take things in hand. There are ladies, Lieutenant. Damnation! Lt. Poupon. Your servant, Ma'am. Christiane Mercier. My pleasure. Torea. Smells good! I took of the army gear and put embroidered sheets on. You've nothing to drink? Gotta hand it to the Supply Corps! Sorry Lieutenant. She came 500 km, though. "The Lady of the Manor" wouldn't have done that. What lady of the manor? Her father's a tenant-farmer! She still lives at the castle. Oh yeah! Merry Christmas. Josiane. Nicole. Merry Christmas. Champagne for these ladies. Do you usually come here alone? Often leave alone. You know Jacques. Don't forget to eat dinner. Could the ladies help us in the kitchen? She came 500 klicks to see me. To see ME. One night... One whole night! At my command... The sauerkraut. Senechal, the wine. You, the bread. The chairs. The gramophone. Get to it! Yessir! Dinner's served! Dinner's served. Just why did you come here? I came to spend the night with you. - You've never written to me. - Michel writes to you. So? You shouldn't feed him bullshit. Instead of what? I reply, to give him courage. - I'm his penfriend. - Bravo. He's addicted to your letters. As you are here, you have to be nice. Meaning what? No one forced you to have sex with him. No one will force me to have sex with him, again. I was writing to him, to have contact with you. You never responded. Sometimes, I thought you were dead. So what? There's nothing between us. It's not for me to tell him that his romance is fake. I'm quite capable of telling him myself. Not this evening. Are you going to be staying with us long? I came to celebrate New Year. Did you see about that doctor who poisoned 27 people? You drink too much, my pet. How long are you staying? I'm enjoying the jeep. They're filming the GI Christmas. OH NO! Music! Let's dance! You're not leaving tonight? Something's burnt. Shit, my pie! Like to dance? We'll have a ball! So Scarlett becomes a widow and then there... So how does it finish? She tells Rhett that she loves him, but in fact, she's always loved Ashley. It ends badly. Rhett is leaving, and says this to her... "Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn!". Shall we dance? Where's the bedroom? The bedroom? It's upstairs. Shall we go up? Right now? The first time was so... That night it was cold. The last time, I was too overwhelmed to achieve... Then, this time, last night... It was fine, wasn't it? Yeah, sure. Anyway, supposing... Well, do you understand me? I'll be 18, on the 3rd of May. We could get married right away. My uncle promised me a job. He sells radios. - Michel... - Don't say anything. If you say yes, I'm not sure I'll make it. Guys are getting chewed up. We won't all make it. If it's "no", I'd rather believe it's yes. - You're crying. - It's just the cold. You've been my most beautiful Christmas. You're disappointed? I'll get leave, soon. Christiane! Write to me. Thank you. Didn't it go well? Is there any coffee? Want to tell me about it? What about you? It was really good. It's not true that it's not good the 1st time. He asked me to marry him. Before or after? Before. Is that why you had sex with him? No. Well, maybe, just a little bit. So? Sorry. David was very disappointed. There was a ball... turkey, ice cream... He asked some questions about you. If you had a lover... about your parents... What happened? Did you see him, at least? What did you tell David? That you had 2 fiances. That calmed him down. I got a marriage proposal. Michel? I loathe him. - Michel? - No, Jacques. Move it! Hi. Sergeant Raisin. 1st Parachute Company. Come on in! Not too cold out there, for you? Happy new year, everybody! Happy new year! - Goodbye! - So long, take care! 26, 27, 28, 29, 30. 5 days without a letter. I don't count 31. I don't count it until midnight. It's normal... they're swamped at the post office. Isn't that normal? A week from now, well be in Paris. You know the rumours about leave. Can I bum a Lucky off you? Thanks. I turn up at her place, with flowers. Will it be a surprise? Keep quiet. They're not far away. You know, with surprises... What about surprises? Forget it. You only see the bad side. You mean the arse? You don't believe in anything about anyone. Love is an arse, feelings are stupid. Women are whores. Just look at the stars. Sky, beauty, God... all of it. You don't even see them. "Planet Earth is a rotten apple. " Do you know Jean Cocteau? A great poet. You were coming with us to mass. Yo make fun of me for praying. I'll give you something to laugh about. I'll be married before God... and have a wife and children... A woman that I respect. Michel... You're in love with your ideal of love. You see the beauty and the sweetness. What if she can't cook? It's like looking at the sky and seeing stars. The things that are falling, are shells. I can't feel my feet... Damned snow. Nothing to report. Come on, it's midnight... We're going to have a drink. ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR, FIVE, SIX, SEVEN, EIGHT, NINE, TEN, ELEVEN, TWELVE Happy new year! Hey, Frenchie, happy new year! Happy new year. Time for champagne. I'd like an ice-cream. Thanks a lot! Can I have one of those? Happy new year, honey! That one, too. My gift... words For me? Thank you. A dictionary. It's all in there. I don't understand. That's what I mean. You did well to come! Take off your glasses. You don't need them. - What's his name? - David. David what? Castelli, Italian... Well, New Jersey Italian. Is he in love with you? We barely know each other. - Are you I love with me? - What? Like to dance, Miss? I don't know how to dance. Come along... I'll teach you! Go on! Come on, then! I hardly know you... But I want you. You don't understand, do you? Not a word? I want that smile every day of my life. Your accent... You'll never lose it, will you? Not a word? I want 6 children... 6 girls... 12 eyes, just like yours... ...looking at me, all the time. What ARE you talking about? Where are you going? I'm not one for big cuddles. Want to dance? I feel a bit queasy. Excuse me... I'll just be a minute. She didn't explode, after 3 strawberry and one chocolate ice-cream! Anyway... ...should go back in. Listen Suzanne, she's 19. She can do what she wants. Aren't you enjoying yourself? Not at all? Feeling better? I ate too much ice cream. It's better. Get ready! You got a fag? Give the other one to your mate. We're not mates... we're brothers! Yeah, brothers... isn't it obvious?! Backup behind the armour! Come on, get moving! Advance, Pouldu! Stop shooting! Cease fire! Stop shooting... We surrender! Cease fire! March forward in line! Round up the prisoners! Hands up! Hands up. "H?nde hoch. " Keep moving, damn it! Halt! Krieg fertig f?r uns. What did he say? "The war is over for us. Your turn to go and get yourself killed. " Raus schnell! Raus schnell! On your feet! Jean-Pierre! Oh, the bastards! Bastards! Jean-Pierre! No, stop! Stop! Don't be an idiot! Stop! For God Sake! Get off me! What do you mean... you missed? It happens. What more can I say? Or it was twins. But that's a disaster, it's not possible. What can I do? September, October, November, December, January, February, March, April... May. Christiane, there's a father out there somewhere. It's snowing. "The flames project... "shadows and lights "on the tired faces of friends... "on the tired faces of friends... "a strange harmony... " Wait! "a strange harmony... " With an "H", Pouldu... harmony. "... of snow and fire. "Harmony... "the word makes me think in your face. "The word "makes me think "once again... of your "face. [Journalist George Senechal shot this morning. ] "The curve of your cheek, "the shadow of your eyelashes, "your gaze so soft, so clear, "intense, mysterious. " That's really something! Mail! Torea... Pouldu. - Senechal - I'll take it. - Nothing for me? - Nope. Here, it's your mother. Still nothing for me. Listen to this... "I'm waiting for you. "I'll make you a gift of my love, of my purity. " Has the lady of the manor had a cork in it? Attention! Here are full rations... We've got ourselves a shindig. - Where's the shindig? - Rossfeld. The marines have freed the village, but they're surrounded. We have to try to get them out. January 12 Sanglier 250.2-5-0 calling Marines B.I.M. Over. Marines B.I.M. here... Glad to see you. We're in front of you, 50 metres from the crossroads. The Krauts flank the village on the east and west. We're approaching the intersection. Get ready to join up with us. We're going with the tanks... Come on! Hans! So it will be French fashion that will revive the new world... ...thanks to those aristocrats of form... ...who are our great fashion designers. Racing... The ladies of Paris will be at Auteuil this Sunday... for the first big steeplechase of the year. Among the starters are Mirabelle, Park Arrow... ...and the great stable favourite... West Wind. At Longchamp, at the weigh-in, you could get to see the countess... Setzen Sie! Tetanus 10. Left leg smashed. No pulse felt. Put him over there. Don't go... I'm going to need you. Amputation... Prepare the anaesthetic mask. Morphine and atropedine. Pouldu, go and see what's going on. Regroup at the edge of the village. What's going on? Panzers. They hit our Shermans. Pull the retractor tight. Hold the leg. Counter-attack by German armour. Don't just stand there! Make yourself useful... There are wounded, for heaven's sake! Let's not be distracted. Los, weitergeben. Hier gibt's nichts zu sehen. Los, los, es gibt keine Gefahr. Okay? Get rid of that leg. What are you waiting for? Finish off. - OH I LOVE TO CLIMB THE MOUNTAIN AND TO REACH THE HIGHEST PEAK BUT IT DOESN'T THRILL ME HALF AS MUCH AS DANCING CHEEK TO CHEEK DANCE WITH ME I WANT MY ARMS ABOUT YOU THE CHARM ABOUT YOU WILL CARRY ME THROUGH TO HEAVEN I'M IN HEAVEN AND MY HEART BEATS SO THAT I CAN HARDLY SPEAK AND I SEEM TO FIND THE HAPPINESS I SEE WHEN WE'RE OUT TOGETHER DANCING CHEEK TO CHEEK WHEN WE'RE OUT TOGETHER DANCING CHEEK TO CHEEK I've been thinking it over. I want the baby. The baby is OK with me. There's only one problem. The problem is the father. The real father. Won't you tell me? Who is the father, Chris? He's dead. The liberation of Paris. I guess that takes care of that. I'm sorry, but it makes me very happy. I'm sorry. - Did you love him? - No. Do you love anyone else? Not anymore. Chris... Will you marry me? Not yet. The following... Bonafay, Dubuisse. Ploarec. Pouldu, Ricquebourg, Senechal, Saint-Bris, Soumaille, and Vernier. Departure of leave-permit-holders 1500 hours. Break ranks. 72 hours of fucking! The lady will be satisfied. You'll have brief me on how farm-girls like it. Don't look so glum... There'll be other leaves. I'd like to exchange my leave with Fournier. Sorry, Fournier just left on a medical-mission with the doctor, Captain Musson. You had a bereavement in your family, right? Your mother needs you. You should go and see her. May I go now, Captain? Jacques! Michel's fine. Every second I tell myself that my little boy can die. Just look at you! Is Michel as haggard as you? Come in, I have some beef stew left over. I have to go up. It's Michel's flag. - Smart eh? - Very. I'll come back for the beef stew. I wanted to say, about your father... I liked him a lot, despite everything. It's Aunt Alice's port. I have a few bottles left. You are hungry? We don't have much. I have cookies. We're well fed in the army. You soldiers are lucky. There's nothing in Paris. Don't you take your coat off? It's freezing cold. We really suffer from the cold. Catherine sleeps with me. We keep warm, don't we? Sit down. How long do you have leave for? Just two days. Where's the painting? I sold it. Badly, of course. People take advantage of your bad luck. Not always. They let me stay in school. The headmistress was nice. Mum was scared I'd be forced to leave. He did nothing wrong, Jacques. Nothing. At the trial, witnesses came to tell... ...about how much service he'd provided. The Valadons... ...and Mrs Carcassonne, too. Did you know she was Jewish? You never mentioned Jews. He was very brave. It hurt to be accused of being a traitor. His articles about the collaboration... I read them. I'd like to talk with your brother alone. You wouldn't mind, Catherine? You'll come and see me? In prison... ...until the very end, he hoped for a sign from you. And you were never accused? I've done nothing to feel guilty about. Those who had enough food are the guilty ones. So you're a one-man tribunal?! The Resistance wouldn't accept me, because of Dad.. So much the better. You'd be dead. You would've saved me, thanks to your friends. Your father took risks... So you could eat lobster at Paquin's... ...and at dear Mr J?nger's, wasn't that his name?! Or ambassador Abetz, who appreciated your recipes... .. and goodness knows who else! I can't make you love me... ...but I won't accept you judging me. I did write to Dad. - Miss Mercier? - That's me. Christiane Mercier. Please come in. She's not here, but you can wait if you like. This is Grandpa. So it's you? You didn't let her know. Sit down. Can I heat up something for you? No, thanks. Do you know where she is? She goes out a lot, in spite of... Well, you know what she's like. In spite of what? Do you have any chocolate? I just might. I'm stupid, I should have... Well, have this. For Grandpa, thanks. Your parents? I didn't want to see them... ...in the car, after the gunfire. Christiane and I ran off... And then she went back to the car. Not me. So this is the way I'll remember them. The 1940 exodus? Hasn't she told you? She's weird. She talks all the time... ...and she says nothing. I'll be going. You can tell her that... You ARE aware, aren't you? She's pregnant. By you, Michel. She hasn't told you? Do you know why? Because she wants to go to America, that's why. I think it's wrong. Sleep tight, honey. See you tomorrow. Good night, David. Are you here to talk to me about Michel? I wrote to him. I told him everything. Everything? He's American. He asked me to marry him. I'm leaving, Jacques. It wouldn't be honest to let Michel have hope. No, that wouldn't be honest. Thanks for coming. Goodnight. Will he be called "David Junior"? Have you told Michel, about that, too? You don't have the right to do that. - A child is made by two people. - Really? Yet men have the right to walk away. - Michel's not like that. - So? I didn't want to have this child... But now, I'll bring it up as I want... ...with the father I want. Deflowering a boy gives no rights to rule my life. And "Daddy" isn't curious? Could be a little Kraut... In war, everyone gets a turn. The women used to be shorn. Now they fleece the Gls. That's the second one today. We CAN just do things for love. Do you love him? Yes.. Or is it just so you can get away? I love him because he wants us to leave here. I love him because he really loves me. Because he wants this child. I love him because I'm sick of grey. I love America... I love their films... and Glenn Miller. So what? What is there to be ashamed of? I've never been ashamed of anything with him... ...because he's someone who's noble and generous. With you I'm always made to feel ashamed... You are so cynical... You're judgmental and destructive. As far as you're concerned... ...Michel is your excuse to tell yourself you can love. Why you hate everyone? And women, most of all? I didn't come to talk about him. Why, then? I hope that you'll be very happy. It seems it's a total stuff-up! Get your kitbags together. What about our leave? Cancelled. Nothing since October. Assemble in the courtyard in 2 minutes. Senechal's jacket. Yeah, thanks. Fall in! Leave bags on beds. I want to tell you, Jacques my love, as since that talk, ...I know something's started... And that kiss you gave me, adds to... Fournier, no time for reading mail. Come on, guys... everyone outside. Vaille, Lamaurie, Torea! Fournier! Well, look who's here! You look lovely! Hi! Did you see the lady of the manor? Her dowry's 2 hectares and some cows. Are you getting married? Get a move on... Go gear-up. - Jacques! - Do you think he's... - Hurry up! - I'm coming. Did you see her? Your mother? She worries a lot, but she's OK. She made a dress out of my flag. No... Christiane! Did you see her? Yes, I did. Why doesn't she write anymore? Maybe because she writes to you. You're a two-faced bastard! You've screwed her. The first night, you screwed her. You said she was a whore. You're filth! You dirty everything you touch. I always knew you'd do it. I have NOT done it! You're my friend. Your friend? I'm the son of the concierge... ...while you are Mr Senechal. Though Senechal is hardly a name to be proud of! Say that again! You get in the truck. An you go and get your gear on. Get behind the tank! What are you doing? You're crazy! Fournier! Get off me! Stop being stupid! She's pregnant! With YOUR baby! A baby? A baby. - Your watch... - Stop bugging me! Forward! Forward! Get behind the second tank! You OK? Yeah. OK. Cover me! Danke. Thanks. Give me the plasma. We're out of plasma. Fournier. Give a caffeine shot here. Duval, make a tourniquet. Can't you see the artery's cut? Any morphine? Two syringes. You wounded? You'll be attended to. We're bringing more wounded. Where shall we put them? Take out the dead. That one. That one, too. Poupon. He's gone. But he's breathing. Get him out, damn it! Pouldu, give me a hand! Poupon. Pouldu, Fournier! Michel, come on! Pouldu, Fournier! Get out of sight! - Sherman? - No, a Tiger. - Who fired? - It's bazookas. Don't move! Hi there! Thanks. No sweat. What unit? 254th U.S. Regiment. Thank you! February 2nd 1945 Order... ...arms! Dismiss! Michel... Shall we have a drink? There are things we need to talk about. I guess there are. I'm going to HQ... I'll see you at the base. Let's drink! There's hot coffee. Biscuits, schnapps... They're cool, those Krauts. The beds are even made. Are there any girls in them? Mail! Placinti, Bourgoin. - Raisin. - Here... I'll write to his parents. Balmino. - Fournier. - I'll take it. Out of the way! The barracks are mined. Those pieces of shit! They mined their barracks! Stop that music, Goddamnit! As the battered German army retreats... ...before the advancing troops of Patton's Third Army... ...Hitler's war machine is quickly... "Dear Christiane, It's nearly 3 months since Michel left us. The approaching outcome of the war is becoming clear, but this last devastating sprint of ours... can cause oversights which can kill our soldiers. It's cruel, a bad joke, like the death of Michel. Maybe you'll never read this letter. You never replied to the last one. Are you already " body and soul" in America? "Bodies and souls" in the plural because I can't help thinking of the child who will always be, no matter what, the child of Michel. Maybe one day when the wounds have closed, you'll feel the need for me to know him or her. Away from the battlefield however, it's a happy ending, A quick but cheerful ceremony was performed at the American Cathedral right in the heart of Paris. As a result, this lucky GI is going to be bringing a French bride home, More and more US soldiers are expected to be asking their commanding officers for permission to marry European girls if they continue their overseas duty. "It's only normal," say Gls, who come in contact with pretty French girls. It seems we'll be getting our American girls stiff competition, from now on. There's a sound problem. - When did you synchronise the sound? - Friday. David... The plane's waiting for you. I gotta go. They're signing the peace in Berlin tomorrow. Sorry I'm in a rush, honey. I'm not going to America. Come on, Castelli! We're waiting for you. Shit! The war is over... This is my life, damn it! Don't move, don't think, don't make any decisions! Wait for me? Please! May 8th, 1945 Jacques! I took your room... but you can have it back. We have a maid again. And then, Mum... Out with it! Do you remember Mr Lalande? He used to visit us before the war. The banker that Daddy liked a lot. - Remember? - Yeah. He came back from London, where he was with General de Gaulle. He came straight to see Mum. I think he's crazy about her. Are you coming up? Not today... Not yet. Can I tell Mum you're back? That you give her a kiss? Sure. Say I love her. Thanks for your letters. Tell me. I'll tell you everything. Give me that. It's heavy. Do you have any news about your husband? He'll be home soon. The Red Cross notified me. He doesn't know anything, of course. I don't know how I'm going to be able to tell him. Do you know I'm going to be a grandmother? A girl... a young woman, rather, came to see me. Christiane Mercier... Do you know her? Yes, I know her. Jacques... Was Michel in love with her? Yes, he loved her. Did he know? Yes. He was very happy. Like to come in for a drink? When did she come? A few days ago. She didn't leave for America? No... I'll be going to see the baby. You should take a taxi before the next contraction. - Who is it? - It's the baby's father, Grandpa. Good... shall we go? Subtitles by FatPlank for KG
