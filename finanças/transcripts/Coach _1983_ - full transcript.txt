(crowd cheering and clapping) (man yawns) (crowd cheers and applauds) - Watch, watch, great shot, turkey. - Oh man. (referee whistles) - You're dreaming, man. - 32, pushing. - Oh, Brad. Get ready, Adam. Hey, Adam, wait. Not now. - Broke my neck, open your eyes, will you? What are you doing here? - Hey, you got five, you're out. - What? - [Player] Let's go, Brad, get off the court. That's five. - It's four. - They have to drag you off the team, you're gonna be out the rest of the season. Do you want that? - I didn't know these people can count. - Anybody ever tell you you have a temper? - I do not. - Checkmate. - [Player] Shoot it. You're not paid to wait there, shoot. (crowd cheers) (horn blares) - Larry, would you cool it with that horn? (whistle blows) (crowd cheers) - Shoot, Adam, shoot. - Shoot, get rid of it. - Now? - Now. (whistle blows) - Hey. You played a nice game. - Right, one of our best. - Leonard, you can put that thing away now. - Just a minute, Mr. Johns. I'm trying out my new strategy. - Huh, strategy. That's what we need. Strategy, hah. - Nice game, Johns. It was a little like throwing the Christians to the lions though, huh? (chuckles) It's all right. We needed the practice. - That's it. I've had it. - There goes another one. - I wonder who they'll get this time. - Does it matter? (man clears throat) - Excuse me. - May I help you, young man? - [Man] I'm here to see, Mr. Prior. - Your name please? - Stuart Linley. - [Secretary] Is he expecting you, Mr. Linley? - I believe so, we have an appointment. - One moment, please. (phone buzzes) - Yes? - [Secretary] Mr. Prior, there's someone out here to see you. - Jolene, I don't have time to see anyone right now. Who is it? - Mr. Linley. He says he has an appointment. - [Mr. Prior] All right, send him in. - Okay, you can go on in. - Thank you. Mr. Prior? Stuart Linley. Good to meet you, sir. - [Mr. Prior] Yes, Linley, how are you? - Is something wrong, sir? - Not that I'm aware of. Mr. Linley, we're a small Christian school here and located as we are in a small community, we're not plagued with the problems of the larger schools. - I'm glad to hear that, sir. - However we do not allow our size to diminish in any way our pursuit of spiritual and academic excellence to the highest degree. Our students are here to learn and learn they will. - I totally agree. - Furthermore, I expect a great deal from my teachers. I require them to run a tight ship and to discipline discordant individuals swiftly and with resolve. Are you thus inclined? - Thus inclined? - Will you agree to administer tough discipline in your classes? - Well, yes, if it's necessary. - Good. I'm glad we agree. There remains one facet of your responsibilities we have yet to discuss. I see here that you minored in physical education. - Yes, sir, I did. - Any coaching experience perhaps? - No. Oh, I substituted for a friend of mine once. - Excellent. - Excellent? - I would like you to coach our varsity basketball team, such as it is. It will require only a few hours a week of your time. Personally, I consider the entire program to be a bother, a total bother. Not to mention the drain on our financial resources. - Mr. Prior, I'm no coach. I am not qualified. - Nonsense. You've coached before, haven't you? - Oh yes, but-- - Well then. That settles it. - Mr. Prior. - Mr. Linley. Let me make myself clear here. I'm asking you to coach our varsity basketball team. I'm not asking for any miracles. Simply make sure the boys show up for the game. Hold a practice occasionally if you must. Just get us through another season. It'll be over before you know it, thank goodness. But I don't want any of this ball playing to interfere with the boys' schoolwork. Is that clear? - Yes, sir. But what about the other coach? - Other coach. He quit and quite unexpectedly I may add. You'll need this, Linley. Miss Riddle has your schedule for today. - Is that a trophy case? - Yes, it is. - Well, where are the trophies? - Why, you're serious. You're actually serious. (laughs) - When you realize that this concept to fix every area of life, it is truly remarkable. To examine this further, turn in your Bibles to Psalm Chapter 19. Psalm 19 verse... You do have your Bibles, don't you? Yes? - Mr. Linley, we didn't think we needed our Bibles in science class. We've never had that happen before. - Yes, I can see that, and that's a mistake that a lot of people make. Separating God from some area of their lives. Oh, it may happen by accident, but it does happen. For instance, let's take a science class. How can we possibly separate God from science? God is the author of science and it's the same for any other field of knowledge. God has given us this as a standard, as his guideline. The psalmist says, "Thy word is a lamp unto my feet "and a light unto my path." Joshua 1:8 says that we should meditate on this day and night and then we'll be successful. There is no area of our lives that should not be aligned with the Word of God. (bell rings) Before you go, your assignment's on the board. Read Psalm 19 and bring your Bibles to class. You're excused. (students chattering) - [Student] Mr. Linley? - Yes? - I just wanted to tell you how much I enjoyed your lecture and I agreed with everything you said. You're the new coach, right? - I guess I am. - I also wanna wish you the best for this year's team. - Thanks. - The guys have been a little hard to work with for the other coaches. - The other coaches? - Well, we've had more than one. Just don't let them get to you, okay? - I'll try not to. - Good. See you later. - Bye. Can you guys tell me where the gym is? - Yeah, go down to the end of the hall, take a left, and go in the double doors. - Okay, thanks. (students chuckle) - There goes another. (student snoring) - [Brad] Hey, watch it, stupid lunatic. - Stay out of my way then. - Come on, you guys. That new coach will be here any minute. Try not to be your real selves first thing, huh? - What's the difference? He'll come in like the rest of them. Rah rah, ding ding, boom boom. We'll lose the next couple of games like always and he'll split. You just watch. - Aw, shut up, Stanton. If you'd keep your head screwed on, you'd at least make it a whole lot easier on him. Where's Russell? - Where you think? - [Player] Russell, will you get over here? Hey, Lavelle, something wrong with this end of the court? - [Player] Hey, who's that, man? - [Player] Check it out, man. - Nice shot. - Not bad. - Who's the captain? - I guess I am. - Spread out around the key and shoot some. - Mays, he said shoot from the outside. This is no Kareem Abdul lookalike contest. - Hey, it's the way I like to move, man. - [Captain] Stanton, why don't you just relax? - That's enough, hold it. You guys don't look like a team and I bet you don't play like one either. Well, that's gonna stop. Practice is over. - How are we gonna become a team if we don't practice? - Get this signed. We're leaving Friday after school. Bring a sleeping bag, change of clothes, and a Bible. You're gonna need it. See ya. - It's the weekend. Who does he think he is, man? - And if you don't make it and you don't have a good excuse, then you're benched for the next three games. (players laugh and chatter) This river may not look rough, but it can be. Our campsite's about four miles down river. Work together and we'll be all right. - Can't even swim. - You can't swim? But you said you could in your consent form. (Brad chuckles) Well, sit in the middle and hang on tight. - This is a piece of cake, man, piece of cake. - All right, get the raft out. Two on each side, pick it up, don't drag it. (slow guitar music) Yeah. - [Player] You ever been down this river before? - [Stuart] Yep. - [Player] It's nice, isn't it? - Sure is. - [Player] Would you get your knees out of my back? - I can't, there's no room. What do you think this is, the Queen Mary? - Hey, coach, how much farther? - [Stuart] Not much. - I'm telling you, Mos, I can't take the knees in the back. - Think I'm getting sick. - [Player] Hey, Tim, would you paddle more? I wanna get there. - There's rough water on the next bend. (players shouting and chattering) There's rough water on the next bend. - Hey, Brad, would you slow down? You're gonna make us go in circles. - [Brad] Tim is, he's dragging. - [Player] Aw, come on, will you try a little harder? - [Player] Listen, would you all shut up? (water rushing) - Oh, it's just the wind in those trees over there. - [Player] How come they're not moving? - Oh, coach. We going through that? - Hell, man, I'm out of here. - We can't do that. - [Stuart] Just hang tight. (players chattering) (upbeat guitar music) (slow guitar music) - Piece of cake, right, Brad? - You know? This would make a nice painting. - Is that? Hey, Coach. Is that an eagle? - No, just a hawk. Eagles are pretty rare these days. We don't find them around much anymore. (twangy guitar music) (men chattering) - Why can't we camp down here? - Yeah. - Yeah. - You like sleeping with snakes? - Not really. - No, not that bad. - All the way, let's get going. Ah. Is anybody afraid of heights? (players whoop) (players chattering) Come on. - Coming, man. - [Stuart] The view is great. (men chattering) - We did it. (men cheer and clap) (men chattering) - Hey, look at the camera, make it a good one. (camera clicks) (slow harmonica music) Before we start working together, there's something I wanted to tell you. I didn't ask for this job and I think there's a lot of guys who could do it better, but it's been given to me and I'll do the best I can with it. There's something else, guys. Things cannot continue as they have been. - What do you mean, coach? - He's talking about us losing all the time, right? - Sure, that's the most obvious thing, but consider this. We are the only Christian school in this conference and what's our reputation? - The Madison Misfits. - Right. Doesn't that bother you? I mean, deep down inside, doesn't it just gnaw at you? Well, it does me. - Well, sure it does. It always has, but what can we do about it? We're outclassed. - Maybe we are, maybe we aren't, but I don't think you can say that until we're playing to the best of our abilities. Have you guys been playing that way? Any of you? Brad? Russell? Mosley? All right, then. Until you are, I don't wanna hear any more about being outclassed. There are a lot of things we could improve on in the skills area. And there's something more important. Listen to this. This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth, but thou shalt meditate therein day and night, that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein. For then thou shalt make the way prosperous and then thou shalt have good success. This is where we begin, by working the Word of God into our hearts. It'll change attitudes and actions and once more, it'll give this team something we badly lack. Harmony. That certain rightness that comes from working together well. Listen. - What? - The harmony of God's creation. Everything for its purpose. Fitting together, working together. Do you guys understand what I'm saying? - How can you be so sure thing are gonna change? - Because I believe in this book and you guys are gonna work harder than you've ever worked before. And I'm not a quitter. Let's have a word of prayer before we hit the sack. Father, we thank you for the safe trip down the river today. We thank you for the beauties of this world you've created for us to enjoy. Help us to study your Word. - [Brad] Russell. Russell. - [Russell] What? - This guy sure is different, isn't he? - [Russell] Go to sleep. - [Stuart] Work it inside, keep the passes fast. Come on, keep up the pace, keep up the pace. Good rebound, keep working at it. (blows whistle) Come on. Hustle on down. - I can't believe this guy. If he keeps this up, we'll all be playing from wheelchairs. - You mean intensive care. - Russell, Brad, Mosley. You three get to stay, the rest of you guys get to leave. (players groan) 15 minutes, come on, some follow shots. 15 minutes, that's all, 15 minutes. (players chattering) (players chattering) That's better, Mos. That's good on the follow through. Russell, go ahead, take a couple. - [Mr. Prior] Mr. Linley. - [Stuart] Mr. Prior. - [Mr. Prior] Do you know what time it is? - [Stuart] Yes, I do. - [Mr. Prior] What do you mean by keeping these boys here until this late hour? - [Stuart] We're almost through. - [Mr. Prior] I specifically stated that this ball playing was not to interfere with the boys' schoolwork. - [Stuart] I don't usually keep them here this late, but we've got a game next week and we're trying to get ready for it. - [Mr. Prior] I'm not the least concerned about the game. I am concerned with their schoolwork. - [Stuart] Excuse me, Mr. Prior. Guys. You can go. Thanks for staying. - Sure, coach. - See you tomorrow. - Okay. - Tomorrow? You're going to hold another practice tomorrow? How many does that make this week? - [Stuart] Mr. Prior, I'm doing what I think is necessary to get this team into a winning condition. - Winning now, is it? Who said anything about winning? - Mr. Prior, I see no reason at all in playing if we're not gonna do our best. - I don't want you flying off into extremes of this assignment. I simply asked you-- - I am not flying off into extremes. I envision a lot for these guys. They could be a really good ball team. - What you envision and what actually exists are worlds apart. I suggest you readjust your expectations with our hapless team and focus on the truly important aspects of your tenure here. - In other words, you want me to just keep doing what's been done before? - [Mr. Prior] That is correct. - I don't think I can do that, sir. - Mr. Linley, I initially judged you to be a man of reason and good sense. I can see now that perhaps I was mistaken. You and I will discuss this more fully at another time. Good evening. - [Stuart's Wife] Do you like the stew? I haven't fixed it before. - Yeah, it's real good. - You haven't tasted it yet. - Yeah, it's great. I knew it would be. - So how's practice going? - It's okay. - Honey, do you really think you can do anything with those boys? You do know that they've only won two games in three seasons, don't you? - Yep. - And one of those was by forfeit. - I know that. - Doesn't that bother you? - Sure, it bothers me, but the guys and I are working to change that. We've got a chance to finally be a good Christian testimony in this conference. This is a real opportunity. - You call this an opportunity? - Yes. Isn't it? - Well, I don't think so. Well, honey, you don't have near the experience you need. - I've got some experience and I've got these books and I'm doing the best I can. I really believe that God will honor that. - Oh, sweetheart. I know how hard you work at something once you've committed yourself to it. I just don't want to see you disappointed. You know, some of the teachers at school, well, they're saying that they think you've lost touch with reality for thinking you can make winners out of that team. - Hey. I don't blame them for that. They've never seen anything but losing. But honey, don't worry about it. It'll work out. - How 'bout some more coffee? - [Stuart] Thanks. ♫ I heard an old old story ♫ How a Savior came from glory ♫ How he gave his life on Calvary ♫ To save a wretch like me ♫ I heard about his glory ♫ Of his precious blood - All right, guys. (cheerleaders cheering) Now we've already asked the Lord to bless our efforts today and I think he's gonna do it, but I can't tell you enough how important it is that you guys work together out there. We're facing a tough team. - We know. - They beat us by 45 last time. - That was then, this is now, so forget about it. Now I'm expecting to see some good teamwork out of you guys today, so let's go out there and make it happen. Now come on. - [Players] One, two, three, let's go. (cheerleaders cheering) (crowd cheering and yelling) - Hey, the boys are looking good today. Think we got a chance? - Of course not. (whistle blows) (crowd cheering and chattering) (Stuart's wife claps) - Got four left, four. - All right, what do you think of that? - It's not over yet. Stop that hedonistic hollering. It's adolescent. (crowd cheers and applauds) - [Cheerleaders] D-D-D-Defense. D-D-D-Defense. (buzzer blares) - Hey, now you guys got it going. Now don't break it up. - Who's top man? - It's Russell with 11, you've got eight. Stanton, Keats and Lavelle. - [Stuart] Hey, forget who's high man. You're all doing good, that's all I need to know. - So we've been fooling around with these choir boys long enough. I want you to start getting tough. There's a guy out there, number 32. His name is Stanton. Get rough with him. When you do, he's going to explode. (horn blares) (crowd cheering and yelling) (whistle blows) (players yell) - Come on (claps). - Get away from me, pal, I don't need that anymore. - Hey, Stanton. 13, you're out of the game. - I don't even wanna play anymore. He can have it. (buzzer blares) (crowd cheers) (whistle blows) (cheerleaders cheer) (whistle blows) - I don't know why I even bother to come to these games. - Aw, y'all suck. - Suckers. Yeah, you suck, man. (crowd cheers and applauds) (buzzer blares) (melancholy piano music) - [Stuart] I'm not a coach. I'm not a coach. God gave me this challenge. He gave it to me. This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth, but thou shalt meditate therein day and night that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein. For then thou shalt make thy way prosperous and then thou shalt have good success. - [Mr. Prior] Absolutely not. I am shocked beyond words that such a proposal has even crossed my desk. - Mr. Prior. New uniforms would mean so much to the team. The ones they wear now look like clown suits with numbers on them. - No. It is out of the question. - I hope you guys are ready for the big speech. - Yeah, this is where they usually split. - I don't know. He's different. I think. - Sure, he's different. The man cares. He believes in what he's doing. - He was humiliated in that last game. - I knew it. I just knew it would turn out like this. - All right, listen up. I've done some serious thinking since your last game and I've come to some conclusions. We're gonna make some changes. We're gonna run more. Now don't get me wrong. You guys played some good ball out there. Then you fell apart, but there's potential and I think you guys are well on your way to becoming a winning ball team. We're gonna start training for the fourth quarter. - Fourth quarter? - We're gonna outrun those guys in the fourth when they least expect it. Our fourth is going to be better than their first. You guys are gonna find out what you got legs for. Now it's gonna mean some extra practices, so learn to use your time wisely and don't let your studies suffer. If your grades go down, you're off the team and you know it. Something funny, Brad? - Yeah. We thought you called us in to tell us you're going to quit. - [Stuart] Quit? - Sure, the others would have by now. - Let me tell you guys something. A famous British preacher Charles Spurgeon once said, "Weave victories from defeat. "Learn success from failure, "wisdom from blundering." I think you guys should know by now that I'm not like the others, but before this season is over, you may wish that I were. Now let's get going, we're running late. (claps) Hey, Leonard. - Yeah, coach? - Who's that kid over there? - Oh, that's Phillip. - Is he waiting for someone? - Nah, he just likes to hang around. - [Stuart] Oh. (TV blaring) Who wants a dog? - No thank you. - He's already had six. (players laugh) - [Stuart] All right, did you see that guy? - [Player] Man, he's great. - Why don't you ever do that, Russell? - I do. - When? In your dreams? - Least I don't get boxing mixed up with basketball. - [Stuart] That goes one for you, Lavelle. - [Mosley] Check this guy, man. - Wow, did you see that? He looks sort of like Mosley. Hey, Mos, did you teach him how to do that? (players laugh) - He's better than Mos. (players chattering) - [Brad] Nice move right there. See how he guards the ball right there? He's tough. - [Russell] Thanks, coach. Enjoyed it. - [Stuart] See you tomorrow. - Thanks a lot, coach. - Goodnight, coach. - [Stuart] See you guys. - You know, even if we played as good as those dudes, we'd still look like clowns with those ranks we gotta wear. - That's the truth. - Hey, take it easy, coach. - We'll see you tomorrow. - See you. - Good morning, could I help you today? - Yes, have you got some basketball uniforms? - Yeah, right back here. - You didn't. Tell me you didn't. - I had to. They needed them so badly and, well, Prior just wouldn't do it. - And so you did? I can't believe you spent that money. It was supposed to be for our new furniture. - It was important. Look, I'll make it up to you. - Important? Isn't furnishing our home important to you anymore? - Of course it is. It'll just mean a few more months. - Oh, I knew this would happen. You're spending all your time on that team and it's all for nothing. - That isn't true and you know it. The experiences those guys have this season will last for a lifetime. - Stuart. Stuart, you are usually so right and I've always trusted your judgement, but this time, you've just gone too far. You've over committed yourself and you've built up a mountain of false hope for these boys. - I have not built up false hope. For the first time in their lives, these guys are trusting in God for his leading and not themselves. For us to claim the promises of God and not have something special happen, it's impossible. (slow inspirational music) - You're impossible. (slow orchestral music) (basketball bouncing) - [Stuart] Who's winning? - [Phillip] Guess I am. Even when I lose, I win at this game. - [Stuart] I guess that's the advantage of playing yourself, huh? - I don't have to leave, do I? I didn't break in or anything. - No, you don't have to leave. - Good. My name's Phillip. You're Coach Linley, aren't you? - Nice to meet you, Phillip. Sometimes I wonder if I'm the coach or not. - Oh, I've been watching you. You're good. - Thanks, I appreciate the encouragement. - I think you're gonna take the team far. - What makes you say that? - You're not afraid to try new stuff and... - And what? - You're not a quitter. I'm not one either. I know one when I see one. - How old are you, Phillip? - [Phillip] 16. - How long have you been... - I haven't been able to walk right since I was a kid. I can still do most everything my friends can do though. Except... - [Stuart] Except? - Except play basketball. But I still play in my mind. Did you know playing in your mind can improve your game? - Yeah, I've heard that. - The subconscious mind can't tell the difference between what's real or imagined. - Hey, you are into basketball. That's some pretty heavy reading. - Yeah. It's pretty interesting, but I also keep stats. - You've got statistics here for the past two years. - Well, three years actually. Some of it's at home. - Phillip, this stuff is great. You've got individual profiles on our players and our opponents. I can scout a few games, but with my schedule... Have you shown this stuff to anybody? - I showed it to Mr. Johns. He just laughed and said, "Messing with numbers won't win ball games." - I can believe that. - I showed Russell Hayes too. He told me to buzz off. Said I'd do anything to travel with the team. - Don't worry about Russell, he talks a lot. Would you, Phillip? Like to travel with the team? Be our stat man? I could really use the help. - Hey, I'd like that a lot. - Okay, bring your books by the office tomorrow and we'll go over this stuff together. Deal? - Deal. Boy, talk about answer to prayer. - See you, Phillip. (students chattering) - You're heading home early tonight. What's the crisis? - It's my wife's birthday and if I'm late, it will be a crisis. - Well, you're off to the right start. Those flowers are beautiful. - Thank you. - Bye. - Bye. - You know the trouble with some people is that they work too hard. - Michael. Michael Hot Shot T. Well, how are you, boy? - Can't complain. I heard you was here, you doing okay? - Great. Hey, what's it been? About 10 years? - At least 10 years. - 10 years. Wow. That's nice. You like it? - Yeah, sure, your basic transportation. I didn't know you were a teacher. I thought you were in business with that construction firm. - Oh, I tried it for a while, but it just didn't work out. Had to get a job doing something, so I started teaching. After a while, I really took a shine to it. Here I am. - That surprises me because you've always been on, you know, making the big bucks and playing the high roller. - Yeah. Yeah, I guess I was, wasn't I? Well, it looks like you're doing all right. - Yeah, yeah, sure. Money's good. Business is doing okay. - You still in church and everything? - Church? Well, no, not exactly. I've been traveling with the firm so much the past few years. That part of our lives has just been up in the air. - Our lives. So you're married. - Yeah. Seemed like the thing to do. I just hope I can keep it together. - Michael, the only way to do that is to put the Lord first. I've sure found that out. - Always were the Bible beater, weren't you? - [Stuart] It works. - I hear they got you coaching. - Yeah, just basketball, that's all they've got here. - Is that guy, Prior, is he still the principal? - Yeah. - I hear he's a real bear. He's even down on sport. - Oh, he has his moments, but he's all right. - What drives you to stay at a school like this? I mean, why not go to a bigger school? Something like a junior college or something? I know you'd get more recognition and it'd certainly triple your pay. - I believe God has called me here. - Think it's a waste of a lot of talent, little buddy. - God's given me a great challenge. These kids need guidance. That basketball team. It'll take it all to get them over the top. - Sounds like an understatement. Hey, I'm gonna have to head on down the highway, but it's been great to see you. Listen, why don't we grill out or do something? Get together? - Let's do it. Later, Michael. (car starts) Come on, push it. - We're tired, coach. - Aw, man. - Need a break. - You trying to kill us? - Oh, man. - Never had us do this before. - How many more of these things we gotta do? - You got two more. Woodings, why you running like that? - New shoes, I'm trying to break them in. - Then make them old shoes. - I'm done. - I'm tired. - Goodbye. - See you tomorrow. - Hey, coach? - [Stuart] Yeah. - You wanted to see me? - [Stuart] Yes, I did. I want us to start having pep rallies on the days we have games. - Pep rallies? You mean like in front of the whole school? - Yeah, something wrong with that? - It sounds like a good idea, but do you really think anyone's going to come? - Oh, it'll be a little slow at first, but it'll catch on. - Well, okay. I'll get right on it. - Good, thanks. - Bye. - Come on, keep the knees up. Keep the knees up. More you run, sooner you're done. All right, gentlemen. Good workout. (players chattering) Come on, get up here. Hurry up, you're not dead. Before you guys go on, I want you to meet our new team member. This is Phillip. (players laugh) - Hey, Einstein, are you gonna play center? (players laugh) - He'll be working with Leonard on statistics. He's got enough numbers to fill a book. Hey. Hey, whatever it takes, we're gonna do it. Maybe Phillip was the missing link. Go on, hit the showers. (players chattering) - Hey, coach, wait. - What? - I got an idea. - What's this? Are you saying this thing is portable enough to set up in a gymnasium? - Oh yeah. Look what we can do. We can set up a whole file on a guy and catalogue all kinds of data on him. - Incredible. Will you guys work together to catalogue the information we have so far? - Sure, I'll let you know when we get it ready. - Yeah, this is great. Come on, let's get it looking nice for the pep rally. Good job. - Thank you. - Get the gum off. Don't let anybody sit on it. Come back and get this part right here. You're gonna have all your fans in here. Looks better, looks good, guys. Looks good. - Hey, coach. - Hey, Tim. - What'd you wanna meet me down here for? - Oh, I wanted to see you for a little bit away from the gym. You ever been here before? - Sure haven't. - There's something inside I want you to see. I've seen some of your work, Tim. It's pretty good. - [Tim] You think so? - [Stuart] I really do. (soft orchestral music) God's given you a great talent. - Thanks, but it's no big deal. I just find painting a real good way to express myself. - What are your plans for the fall after you graduate? - Well, I've thought about business school. I'll probably work with my dad's firm in the summers and go with him full time when I get out. - Is that what you really wanna do? - I don't know. - Have you ever thought about pursuing your art? I mean, studying it. - I used to, but it's like my dad says. What kind of future would a guy have as a half baked artist? - Half baked artist, huh? Tim, there are thousands of people making good livings doing the things they're truly gifted at. Do you enjoy painting? - Oh sure. When I paint, I feel right. Sometimes I find it easier to say what I wanna say with just a picture. - Are you familiar with the parable of the talents? - Vaguely. - Regardless of what talents we have, God expects us to invest them for him. If we do, he rewards us. If we don't, he can diminish those talents and perhaps even take them away. - Take them away? But my dad wants me to go into business. - Hey, the last thing I wanna do is drive a wedge between you and your dad. That's no good, but you've got to tell him how you feel. He needs to know. - I don't know. - Hey. Trust the Lord, Tim. He cares about this as much as you do. - Will you help me, coach? I mean, if I need it. - You mean, you want me to talk to your dad? - Yeah, if it'd be all right. - Sure, if it'll help, I'd be glad to. - Thanks. Coach, what are your talents? - Oh, I guess helping guys like you find theirs. - You're pretty good at it. - Thanks. Hey, there's some watercolors in the other room I want you to see. - Great. - Okay, now we've trained for the fourth quarter. They won't be ready for it. Now let's go out there today and play like winners, all right? (players clap) Let's get dressed. - [Mosley] Get going now. - But not only will you play like winners, but you're gonna look like winners. (players clap and chatter) - [Russell] These are great. - [Stuart] How 'bout them threads? - You mean we won't have to wear these goof suits anymore? (Mosley laugh) - I've got a good feeling about this game today. Oh yeah. - [Stuart] All right, it's just about time to go out, but before we go, there's someone here I've asked to speak to us. Pastor Brooks? - How you doing, pastor? - Hey, pastor. - I just wanted to come by and say a word before you go out today. I've spent some time with your coach the last several weeks. He's informed me of your progress. I just want you to know that I believe in what you're doing. I'm proud of your spirit, the hard work you've put in. You guys have made some good accomplishments. Being the only Christian school in this league of Goliaths has been difficult, I know, but I believe the Lord will use you and honor your efforts. It's a tremendous opportunity to strive for excellence in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Give it all you have, fellas. There may come a time in your future lives far beyond the bounds of this gymnasium that you'll be confronted with even a greater challenge, but with God's help, you can handle it just as you will today. This is a time for learning, learning to ask God to use you and then accept what comes from that. Being willing to give him the glory for it. He may allow you to be disappointed, but then he may call on you to be a smashing success, but in either case, praise him for the outcome. You can tell I'm a preacher. Sermons are unavoidable. God bless you today, fellas. I'll be praying for you. (players chattering) - Thank you, Pastor Brooks. Well. That's it. So let's go and do it. (cheerleaders cheering) (crowd cheers) - Boss, boss. Check these guys out, man. - Look, the guys got new uniforms. Don't they look great? - Look, Alvin. Look at them, don't our boys look sharp? - Yes, they do. They do indeed. - Alvin, where are you going? Alvin! - Coach, a moment with you please? How dare you requisition new uniforms when I specifically forbade you? It's unthinkable. - They look good, don't they? - What? - Mr. Prior, I didn't use any money out of the equipment account. I used the special funds account. - We don't have a special funds account. - I do. I used some money that Barb and I had saved for new furniture. - You? You mean you bought those uniforms out of your own pocket on your salary? - Mr. Prior, look at them. They look good. I mean, really good. They needed this. This school needed this. Mr. Prior, we're Christians. In this conference, this school has been a joke. I believe that the Lord deserves the very best. Yeah, I did it and I'd do it again too because I think it's right. Now if you'll excuse me, I got a game to win. Hey. The guys could really use your support. (buzzer blares) (crowd applauds and cheers) (crowd applauds and cheers) (crowd applauds and cheers) Stay low on defense. (crowd applauds and cheers) (cheerleaders cheering) (crowd applauds and cheers) (horn buzzes) New guy going in. - What's his name? - 13, Markham. (computer beeps) - Markham. Plays forward, 6'2". Average points per game, 21. Number of rebounds, average. Free throws, 76%. Nothing unusual. Wait a minute. This guy's red hot on the baseline. Better get somebody on him now. - Thanks. Russell, Russell. This new guy, 13, name's Markham, is red hot on the baseline. Now go in for Williams. Play it tight, we're going eight big ones. Smother them. - Now how did they know that? I thought you said these guys were pushovers. That coach knows what he's doing. (crowd applauds and cheers) (crowd applauds and cheers) (whistle blows) Yeah, what kind of a pass was that? Terrible, watch your passes, guys. - [Player] Dang, coach, I'm tired. - So what? They're tired too. - Brad, you're doing great. You're all doing great. Now Mos, now work for it. - Now let's get on these guys. We can send these Holy Joes home crying to Mama. - Come on, we've all worked for it for so long. Now let's grab it. - Let's go. - All right, come on, baby. - God, help us to do our best and to do it for your glory. Amen. (players yell) (crowd applauds) (crowd cheering) - Now keep it up, work together. (crowd applauds and cheers) That's it, Russell, stay on him. (crowd applauds and cheers) Cut off the baseline. (crowd applauds and cheers) (crowd applauds and cheers) (buzzer blares) - We won, we won. Alvy, we won. - Laverne, contain yourself. And don't call me Alvy in front of the students. It isn't dignified. I'm aware of our victory and I must admit it is considerable. - Hey, you guys might have beat us this time, but we're gonna be back and I'm gonna be there. - We'll just see about that, pal, all right? - Brad. Right here, finish your play. Good game, buddy. - Hey, class act, pal. Class act. - Thanks, Michael.

Layeth not for yourselves treasures upon Earth where moth and rust doth corrupt and where thieves break through and steal, but layeth for yourselves treasures in heaven. We wanna win some ball games. We wanna do well. We'd like to get a trophy or two, but the greatest trophies will come from God and I hope that for each of us, our treasure is in heaven. - [Mosley] Coach, how come you didn't bring the whole team to hear this guy? - I didn't think they'd appreciate hearing him as much as you would. - I've always wanted to hear him speak. I hope we can get a good seat. - Bobby Jones, a child of the king. - Basketball has been number one in my life, but I've seen through God's love and through the conversion of my life to Jesus Christ that it's really not that important, as far as our priorities go. When I asked Jesus to come into my life to save me from my sins, I experienced a conversion and awareness in my life that God has more planned for me than to just play basketball and the winning, the attitude that I had that if I didn't win that I had not accomplished anything went out the window. I thank God that he gave me the strength to play the game and I was given an awareness and an appreciation for the fact that I was healthy enough to play basketball and had the ability to do that and in the NBA, the Lord has helped me to see through the mask of many people who try to make their life mean something through drugs or through fancy cars or clothes or whatever they might wanna do to be accepted and it's not only in the pros. It's also in college and in high school where we see people trying to be accepted by other people, by their peer groups and that pressure that's put on them to try to take a drink or to use beer or drugs or whatever it might be is really strong, to say that to be accepted, you've gotta do this and I thank God that I have the acceptance through him to not have to be accountable to any man, just to the Lord Jesus and I thank him for the satisfaction and peace that he's given me in my life. - Hey. My name is Mosley Mays and I appreciate the things you've said tonight. It's made me think a lot. - I'm glad you came, I praise God that you're here. - Thank you very much. - [Stuart] He's a good speaker, isn't he? - Aw, he's all right. Coach, I wanna walk home. - Why? - I've got some thinking to do. You don't mind, do you? - Course not, Mos. Anything I can help with? - No. I need to work it out by myself. I'll see you later. - Goodnight, Mos. - [Student] I'm through now, Mr. Linley. - Thank you, Danny. How's it going, Ace? - Okay, coach. - Something crowding your mind, Mos? - Coach, you ever been wrong? - [Stuart] Are you kidding? - I mean downright stupid. - Aw, Mos. I've done some things that could've won me the knucklehead of the year award. - The other night, when that dude was talking. - [Stuart] Yeah. - He said some things that cut through me like a knife. - I know what you mean. - Coach, I hadn't been playing for the glory of God. I've been playing for me. Marvelous miraculous me. - [Stuart] I know that. - You did? - Sure. Something like that shows. But Mos, you're good. God made you good. Hey, there's no crime in being good. The crime comes in being proud. You know what the Bible says about that? - [Mosley] No, what? - Proverbs 16:18 says pride goeth before destruction and a haughty spirit before fall. We're gonna reap what we sow. It's inevitable and God tells us the fruit of pride and a haughty spirit is destruction and a fall. It's really simple. We handle problems in our lives by following God's commandments. - That's in there? - Sure. If you want honor, sow humility. - What about playing college ball? - Is that what you really wanna do? - More than ever. - Psalm 37, four, five, and six. Delight thyself in the Lord and he shall give you the desires of your heart. Commit thy way unto him. Trust in him and he shall bring it to pass. - You're using that book like it's the answer for everything. - It is, Mos. That's what I've been trying to tell you guys all year. This is God's blueprint for our total success. - This is a powerful book. Why don't Christians use it more, coach? - I don't know. Ignorance maybe, but I do know this. They'd avoid a lot of heartache and hassle in their lives if they only would. - [Player] I hear they haven't lost a game all season. - [Player] Have you seen those guys? They look like a bunch of apes. You have a brother that goes to that school, don't you, Adam? - [Adam] A brother, sure. (players laugh) - [Player] I'm only kidding here, have a banana. - [Player] I don't see that these guys are any different from any other team we've played. - [Mosley] That's right, the dudes are cocky. Last thing they're expecting is to lose. - Hey, coach. - Hey. - What's up, coach? - Hey, coach. - [Stuart] How's the fishing? - It's not too good. - You got one? Hey, come on down here, I wanna tell you something. - Sure, coach. - (laughs) Just a second. - [Stuart] I wanna tell you guys how proud I am of the accomplishments you've made this season. Of your progress on and off the court. It's been exciting to see you guys develop into a winning team and mature as young men. That's what makes my job rewarding. - I don't think we could've done it without you, coach. - That's right. - Yeah, the others didn't seem to care as much as you do, coach. - Thanks. I appreciate that. We've had success on the court this year because you guys have learned to work together. You developed some of that harmony we've talked about and the scoreboard has shown it, and you two have been great with the computers and the numbers. Knowing our opponents has been critical to our success. But above all that, we've had the blessing of God. We've prayed about it, we've been in the Word, and God has blessed us in a way I never thought was possible. So far this year, we have met most our problems on the basketball court, but in just a few months, you guys will meet some of the biggest problems of life. Where do I go to college? What occupation should I train for? Who should I marry? And you're gonna need a strategy, a game plan and the strategy is the Word. (slow violin music) Order your life by the book and you'll succeed. Forget about it and you're gonna fail. It's just that simple. In 20 years, some of you guys won't remember how to hold a basketball, but you be true to God and he'll be true to you. You honor him and he'll honor you. It's just that simple. I didn't bring you guys up here to preach at you, but I care about each one of you and I want you to have a life that's successful and satisfying and you'll have it if you do it God's way. (Mr. Prior clears throat) Mr. Prior. - Mr. Linley. I mean, Stuart. It's not often that I feel compelled to admit or rather, that my judgement has been amiss regarding an individual and well, frankly, I feel you've done a superlative job in the classroom and on the court. To be honest, you have accomplished what I previously thought to be impossible. - Thank you. - Never have I seen the students so excited about learning, especially in their Bible classes. You've started something here and it's a good thing. - It's no sacrifice, Mr. Prior. I love the students. - I know that. It shows. The board has given me approval to reimburse you for the new uniforms you bought. Now go and buy your wife some furniture. - Mr. Prior, you didn't have to do this. - Yes. Yes, I did. God bless you. - Thank you, sir. - And whip 'em good, coach. - We'll do our best. - [Opposing Coach] All right. I'm not gonna tell you guys anything you don't know already. You've won 24, make it 25. Don't fool around with them. Just do it. - Now listen up. I think we all feel the same way about this one and we can do it. The system ready, Phillip? - Yes, coach. - [Stuart] Any problems? - Nope. - Good. Now remember it's teamwork and a chain is only as strong as its weakest link. Any questions? (cheerleaders cheering) Father, we thank you for bringing us this far. We do ask that you would assist us and empower us to do the very best we can. Help us to play with clear minds and cool spirits, that we may honor you as we should. We thank you and do pray this in the name of Jesus, our Lord. Amen. - Let's go, all right. - Come on. (players clap) - Let's get 'em. - Let's get 'em, fellas. - [Team] One, two, three, let's go. - [Opposing Coach] We'll have a back screen for Wakefield with a layup. - Hey, you guys, we got these clowns so well. They were in their locker room praying. (team laughs) (cheerleaders cheering) (crowd cheers and applauds) - You clowns are gonna be sorry you showed up for this game. - Come on, Brad, let's go. - You there? - I'm here. - Good, standby. (horn buzzes) (crowd cheering and yelling) Good defense, stay on it. (crowd applauds and cheers) (horn buzzes) I want you guys to run that shift, the one we used against the Bulldogs, remember? Pull to the right and run the rotation. It'll really confuse them. - What are they doing, coach? - Don't worry about it. Just run what you always run. What's the matter with those chowder heads? They see a new routine and they go flinky on me. - Madison used to be so rotten. What happened? - Oh, there's a new coach. My husband. - [Woman] Oh, really? - What is wrong with you? Did your timing change slip or something? - What do you expect me to do, jump over the Mays guy? He's 10 feet tall. - What is it with you guys? Will you just play ball? (buzzer blares) (whistle blows) (crowd applauds and cheers) - Who falls off the most? - I'll go to check it. Usually Stevens, big man. - Thanks. (crowd applauds and cheers) (crowd applauds and cheers) (crowd applauds and cheers) (buzzer blares) - What's the deal? What are you playing with these guys for? You need the big league now. We've played these clogs before, remember? - [Player] I thought we did. - Okay, it's time to get rough. Work on that Stanton character. I've seen him blow like a cork before. Hit him, you get him out and they'll fly apart. (crowd applauds and cheers) - [Stuart] Brad, you've gotta handle that temper. A lot of people may depend on your cool spirit someday. - [Brad] I can't help it. When somebody makes me mad, I'm mad. That's it. - That's not it. Read this. - I don't wanna read it. - I said read it aloud. - [Brad] He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty. - [Stuart] Read it again. - [Brad] He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty. Better than the mighty. - I guess they got you picked as the weak link. - This team doesn't have any weak links, coach. (crowd applauds and cheers) - Bravo, I say bravo. - Alvin, this isn't a concert. - Sorry, dear. I'm new at this. - You're doing fine. (crowd applauds and cheers) - [Brad] Coach, these guys haven't lost a game all year. What chance have we got? - [Stuart] Have we trained hard, Brad? - [Brad] Yeah. - [Stuart] Have we tried to serve God in our lives and playing? - [Brad] Yeah. - [Stuart] Do we honor God when we win? - [Brad] Well, we all want to. - [Stuart] We sure do, and that's what God wants. He wants us to work hard, hard as we can for his glory.
