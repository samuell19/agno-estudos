The Jeppson's crates came! The train broke down and Mr. Adams showed up with everything! They're really big, there are at least ten of them! Well, that's fine but there's nothing we can do about it tonight. Pa, no! We have to deliver them! Oh, no you don't! Not with this storm and it's Christmas Eve. Pa! We have to! They've been waiting forever. It is too dangerous. They might not even have food, Pa. And it's Christmas. God helps those that help themselves. But isn't that what we're here for? Oh no no no!

And it came to pass in those days that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus, that all the world should be taxed. ♪ ♪ And all went to be taxed. Every one into his own city. And Joseph also went up from Galilee. Out of the city of Nazareth, into Judea. Unto the city of David which is called? Bethlehem. Because he was of the house and lineage of David. To be taxed with Mary his espoused wife being great with child. And so it was that while they were there the days were accomplished that she should be delivered. ♪ ♪ And she brought forth her first born son. And wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger, because there was no room for them at the inn. And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night. And the angel said unto them: "Fear not, for behold I bring you good tidings of great joy. Which shall be to all people For unto you is born this day, in the city of David: A Savior. Which is Christ the Lord. And this shall be a sign unto you. Ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger." And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly hosts praising God, and saying "glory to God in the highest" and on earth, peace, goodwill toward men." Children, though we don't have much right now. What we do have is the gift of God's Son. That is the true miracle of Christmas. Now, let's say our prayers because it's time for bed. What are you gonna tell them? In-in the morning? Merry Christmas. —Merry Christmas, Ellen. —Merry Christmas, Ellen. I'm praying for Santa, so he doesn't get lost. He can still find us, right Pa? I'll leave a lamp lit so he can't miss us. In it's own way Christmas will always find us. Goodnight, children. Goodnight, Ellen. Goodnight, Ma. I can't tell which way it was pointing! We'll never find the Jeppsons' cabin out here in this! Maybe we should go back! We'll be just as lost going forwards as backwards! Come on up! ♪ ♪ Perhaps Ellen's right. Perhaps we shouldn't be keeping our hopes up. Hope is all we have, Leland, and our blessings. Few as they may be. I told her that before dinner. I just wish somehow things could be better.

Are we even on the road? You and Mother were right, it's too dangerous. We'll be alright. Take the lines! Straps are loose. Dear Lord, we can't do this by ourselves, we need thy help. Please Lord, help us. ♪ ♪ Pa, look! There's a light! Leland... Leland... Leland... there's something outside! Get the children. Shhhh... Is it Santa? George? It is Santa! What are you doing here?
