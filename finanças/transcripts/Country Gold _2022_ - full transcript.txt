- Good evening. When we began these specials twelve years ago, the artist we're going to meet tonight was a struggling unknown. But these days, he is entering the history books as the number one singer in America, selling more records than Michael Jackson and Madonna. And he's doing it with country music. His name? Troyal Brux. You're at the height of your career. A million records sold. And everyone looks up to you as a country music hero. - Hero. I mean, there's, there's that word again. You know, I think it's time we redefine that word. You know, am I a policeman or fireman saving lives? Yeah, in a way. I'm saving souls with my tight-ass voice. - Tell us, Troyal, who are your heroes? - My heroes? I mean, that's easy. You know, the legends. The people that paved the way, that came before me. You know, we're talking about Johnny Cash, Merle Haggard, Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson. These people that marched to the beat of their own drum. - And if you could meet any one of them today, who tops the list? - Kind of put me on the spot there, Gail. If I had to choose anyone, I guess it'd be George Jones. - And if George Jones was watching you from home, what would you say to him? Bub Nelson. It's best when shared with someone you love, or someone you just like to have a good... - Cut. - What was wrong with that one? - Okay, Troyal. No, it's good, it's good. But, uh, I'd like you to relax a little more... - I am relaxed. - Well, you're about to have a beer. You don't have to, they, they do want a sense you're gonna enjoy it. - I mean, I probably will enjoy it. - Well yeah, Bub Nelson. - What do you want me... - Just say it. Say it with me, Bub Nelson. - All right, I got it, I got it, Bub Nelson. - Bub Nelson. - Bub Nelson, I got it. - It's easy, right? You got this, I know you do. - All right, yeah, I got it, okay. - Great, all right, go again. - Bub Nelson. It's best. Uh, it's best shared. - Cut. - See, now you're, you're all in my head. You got me all messed up now. I can't even do anything, I can't concentrate. Bub Nelson. Uh, Bub Nelson, it's best when shared. - Cut. - With someone. I can get it right, I just gotta... - Yeah, c'mon... - No, I'll, I'll go around. - Yeah, let's just go again. - Let's go again. - Okay, all right. - Bub Nelson. It's best when shared with someone you love, or someone you just like to have a good time with, like me: Capitol recording artist Troyal Brux. - Okay. It's good. Let's go again. - Why would we go again? That one's good. That was, that was the best one. - 'Cause we're just warming up. - That's the best one we've done yet. - Yeah, yeah, no, it's good, but you can do better. I know you can do better. - How much time do you wanna waste? Let's just waste all my time. - It's not a matter of wasting time. - And let's waste all the crew's time, just because you don't know how to do your job. - I like, I like that you care. Just relax. - All right, look, I'm gettin' a little upset and I'm sorry about that, all right? - Okay, c'mon, let's just do it again. - All right - No worries, man C'mon, buddy, we got it. - What was wrong with that one? - Well, you probably shouldn't flip the can, if you're gonna crack open and drink- - I like the flipping the can, the flipping the can's cool. It shows I can do the trick. - But, it's not gonna work. - It shows I've got talent. It's not gonna work if you can't drink it. - The whole point of you hiring me is because I have talent. - Naturally. - Look how I can do it. - Troyal, I think it's great. Look, I can keep on flipping. - 'Cause if it works, you were, like... - I flip it right every time. I can juggle it. - No, I, I, I, I don't... - I can juggle the whole fuckin' thing, how 'bout that, huh? - I don't want that. - I don't want that. - I got ideas. Let's just try again, try again, try again. Let's just do it all f... - Yeah! Bub Nelson. It's best when shared with... - Cut it. - What the fuck was that? - Boom in the shot. - Yeah, boom in the shot. He fucking hit me in the god damn head. He could have hurt somebody. He could poke somebody's eye out with that fuckin' thing. - C'mon, let's just take a sec, let's settle. - Piss juice. - Cut! - Do you think Dad will be home for Christmas this year? - I don't know. - Last year we weren't so lucky. - Yeah. - Maybe this year will be different. - I don't think so. - Now, boys. I don't wanna hear no guff outta neither one of you this year, if your daddy can't be home for Christmas. - Yes, mama. - He provides for us, tenfold. Last thing we need is to make him feel guilty. These are his prime years, and he needs to make the best of it, 'cause tomorrow it could all go away. You understand what I'm sayin', boys? - Yes, mama. - Nicholas? - Yes, mama. - All right. Now, come here, babies. - Well, what do we got goin' on here? - Dad's home! - Why don't you boys go give your daddy a hug? - I don't know what I did to deserve this. - Letter came for you today. You didn't eat much. You know, I worry about you not eating enough, Troyal. You got a long way to go, and it's best to start gettin' some good habits. Earlier, the better. Your mom and dad could both die of heart failure on the same day, I guarantee you, it's 'cause they weren't eatin' right. This family's seen enough tragedy in the time that I've been a part of it. I just want you to see your children grow up. Is that too much to ask? - Baby, do you know who wrote this letter? - Somebody named Jones. - Oh yeah, somebody named Jones, yeah. Try George Jones. - George Jones? You mean "George Jones" George Jones? - The George Jones. The greatest country and western singer of all time. - Well, Troyal had said it, but knew in his heart that it was hyperbole. It was unspoken knowledge that the title of the greatest country and western singer of all time belonged to none other than one Roger Nelson, who had written some of the most unique and thought-provoking material of the genre. The night before he was to walk into the recording studio for the first time in the fall of 1976, Roger was stabbed by a homeless man and died in a ditch with only his ideas to keep him warm. - Well, what'd he say in the letter? - He wants me to go see him off in Nashville. - See him off? Where's he going? - It doesn't matter where he's going, it matters where he's been. - How old is he now? - I don't know, he's prob'ly gettin' up there. One country legend to another country legend, wants me to come out there, hang out with him. Of course, it's this weekend. - Oh, baby, this weekend? The boys will want you to play catch with them. You know, we're all just really glad to have you home for a while. - And I appreciate that, and I appreciate this whole Betty Crocker thing we got going on here. This Norman Rockwell painting. - Oh, you do? Oh, well that's good to know. - Yeah, but I can come back and, uh, play catch outside with Nicholas and Christoff any day of the week. - Christopher. - That's what I said. Anyway, it doesn't matter. I got this locked down. I make nothing but hit records and baby boys. - Mm-hmm. - Mm-hmm. Ain't that right? - You do. - Yes I do. - But that's not the point. - Baby, I idolize this man. Do you understand that? - I know you do. But you know who those boys idolize? - Probably one of those stupid cartoon characters they watch. - No. Their father. They idolize you, baby. - Maybe I'll, uh, get 'em a souvenir or somethin' while I'm out in Nashville. - Oh, I'm sure you will, baby. - Probably something big and extravagant. George motherfuckin' Jones. Hey, can I get more vocals in my monitor? Y'all ain't gonna guess where I'm going this weekend. - Where you goin', Troyal? - Nashville, Tennessee. - What you got goin' on in Nashville? - How about dinner and drinks with a country legend? - Waylon Jennings? - No, not Waylon Jennings, it's a different country legend. - Oh is it, is it Johnny Cash? - No, God. It's George Jones. - You gonna drink with The Possum? - Yeah, The Possum. See, he knows what I'm talkin' about. - Whatever happened to him? - I heard he drowned in a bottle of whiskey. - Nope, he got clean, he's sober. - All of a sudden, y'all know so much about George Jones. Anyway, yeah, he invited me out. To Nashville, Tennessee. For dinner and drinks, which is an industry standard. 'Cause one legend wants to hang out with another legend, 'cause we have the most in common. You guys will understand when you're more established. Bottom line is we're probably gonna get drunk. - Well, how come you don't get drunk with us? - I do get drunk with you guys. I get drunk with you guys all the time. - You don't drink like that. - That is so frustrating. I could drink any one of y'all under the table, except for Melvin. - Well, you can't outdrink me. - I'm talkin' about in like a competition-type setting, Ray. Like, if there's four or five beers in front of us, I get to number four, you'll be at number three. Which is more of a speed thing, but I think they also count for quantity. - I think it's pretty cool. - Oh, there goes Melvin. The only one with any sense in this band. Of course, his playing could be improved upon. Let's hit it. - One, two, three, four. - Before you ask me why I'm late, you need to be askin' yourself why I'm still messin' around with these bottom-feeder bandmates. - They got a special here, it's a pear-glazed pork loin with basil droppings. - Pear-glazed pork loin with basil droppin's, that's, that's what it's come to now, hasn't it? - Yeah, I better not commit to the calories this early in the afternoon. - I'll tell you what, I'll commit to whatever calories they got, as long as you're buying. - Well, that's protocol, isn't it? - That's probably the best thing we got goin' on with this relationship. - Here's what I got for you. This weekend down in Dallas is Governor Richards' birthday. You're gonna go down there, play a few songs, shake a few hands, kiss a baby. You jump back over the Red River, $25,000 richer. That's take-home money. That's in your pocket. That's after fees. That's after my fees. The boys, they get their minimum wage, travel costs, all that. - Well, that sounds real tempting, except for I'll be in Nashville, Tennessee this weekend. - You don't have anything in Nashville this weekend. - No, this ain't in the books. See, I'm gonna be hangin' out with a country and western legend. Maybe you've heard of him. His name's George Jones? - You're recordin' songs with George Jones? - No, we're not gonna be recordin', man. We're just gonna be hangin' out, sitting across from each other. Mind-meldin'. - Like, talkin' 'bout future projects? - I don't know what we're gonna be talkin' about, man. We're just gonna be shootin' the shit. - Are you tellin' me that you're willing to throw away 25 grand, to go have soup with a 60-year-old, washed-up has-been possum? - Well, you make it sound better than it actually is, but yeah. Uh, I'm gonna have, uh, American cheeseburger, and this guy's gonna have the pork loin pear glaze. How about that, huh? Thank you. - I don't understand. All right, this, this isn't Hank Williams Jr. This isn't Charley Pride. This is a, this is an old man that's washed up. He's trying to get what you got. - Look, I have been a fan of George Jones since I was a wee little baby boy. Now, this is a golden opportunity for me, and I'm definitely not gonna let it pass me by over some money. - Well, that's why the people love you, isn't it, Troyal? It's that passion. - God damn right. - I met my hero once. - Yeah? - Yeah. It was in Boston at a charity event. Joltin' Joe DiMaggio. - You met Joe DiMaggio at a charity event? - Isn't that something? - Well, it's a small world. - I walked up to him, I introduced myself. I shook his hand. I thought that'd be where we left off. But no, we got to talkin', we were havin' a good time. Our ladies started talkin', we're out to dinner, and I got his number, and I can call him right now. - You can call Joe DiMaggio right now? - I can call Joe DiMaggio right now. Pick up the phone, I can talk about baseball, I can talk about the wind. - See, that's, that's the same thing that's gonna happen with me and George. I'm gonna go out there, we're gonna hang out. We're gonna become best friends. He's gonna be sending me Christmas cards. I'm gonna be sending him Christmas cards. Hell, we're gonna have things to do with each other that don't even revolve around Christmas. Shit, I'm gonna have a room for him to stay at my house. Man, I'm gonna have a bunch of rooms, for a bunch of country and western legends. My house is gonna be the, like, the United Nations for country and western legends. - Wouldn't get 'em all booked at the same time. You know, you keep talkin' about what you wanna do, and hope somethin' will happen, and you don't do it and it won't happen. - Well, that's a nice sentiment. Except for in this case, it doesn't work. 'Cause I am makin' it happen. - Well, that's a Joe DiMaggio quote, Troyal. - Well, it's a good quote. - Y'know, the first time a reporter asked Joe DiMaggio for a quote, he thought it was a soda pop. Isn't that funny? - Kind of slow, then, isn't he? - Well, he's not slow, he's, he's a center fielder. And, you know, he, he was a rookie. I'd like to see your rookie card. - My rookie card? Shit, it'd be filled with stats. The whole back side, just nothin' but stats, printin'... - Whole lot of strikeouts. - Numbers. Well... - They might let you play first base. - Baby? - Yeah, baby? - Why do you think George Jones wrote me that letter? - 'Cause he wants to spend time with you. Everyone does. - There's not enough time in the world for that. But that, that doesn't sit right with me. I mean, he's an icon. And I'm bound to be an icon. If he's on his victory lap, I'm, I'm on the home stretch. - Yeah, you're on your way, baby. - Maybe he feels a connection to my music, the way I felt a connection to his growing up. - Yeah, baby. - Maybe it's one great artist reachin' out to another great artist so he doesn't feel so lonely. I know what that's like, hell. - Good night, baby. I love you. - Good night. - Troyal? - Yeah. - I feel like we're losing you. - Why would you say that? - Dear Troyal, I'm writin' to you today in hopes you're doin' well and your family is thriving. I watched your special the other night on TV and I have to admit, it left quite an impression on me. I was touched by your words and appreciate them more than you know. You seem to be well on your way to becoming a country superstar yourself. I would like to invite you back to Nashville next weekend if you are free. I'm taking a very extended vacation soon and it would be an honor if I could meet you before I go. I understand if you're too busy to accept. Best, George Jones. - Welcome to Nashville. - Howdy doody. They got me here a reservation right here for Travis Wiley. - Travis Wiley, let me see. - That's kind a stupid name and I didn't come up with it. You might wanna check who made that reservation. - Capitol Records? Are you a musician? - Guilty as charged. I'm actually a pretty good musician. You like country music? - Mm-hmm. - Well then, you might recognize this face. You might recognize this shake. Huh? - Mmm. - I'm Troyal Brux. - Oh my God! Oh. Sorry. - Shh. Okay, listen, this is of utmost importance, all right? Now, I'm here for Nashville, one night, one night only. I wanna be treated just like normal folk. Just like I was just a normal guy that came in here and booked a room. Travis Wiley. That's why I go by that name. That's, that's what's called an alias. - Of course. We'll take real good fuckin' care of you. - You are a live one. - Bullseye! - But no, I, I do appreciate that. And that's why I like to stay at this nice hotel. This is a, this is a real nice establishment, and uh, you guys are all real nice. You treat me real well. - Here's your key card. It's room 1615, and if there's anything you need, you let me know. - You bet I will. - Enjoy your stay! - Thank you. Oh, hey, well there he is. Head honcho, you're the big man of security, huh? - Hm. That's me. - You wanna walk me to my room? - Sure. Now, I don't know if they talked to you downstairs about who I am or what I'm doing here today. - Oh man, I know who you are. - Oh yeah? I didn't picture you to be a country music fan. - I mean, I wouldn't say that. We went to Stillwater together. From '82 to '85. - You went to Stillwater from '82 to '85? - Yes, sir. Played football. - Small world. I mean, what was the number on your jersey? - 31. - 31. Well. Was a good team those years. - Yeah. - Same year as I went, y'know? - Yeah. Yeah. - Well, what you doin' here in Nashville? - Man, just workin' in a hotel. - That's as good a living as any, I guess. - You played the guitar? - Yeah, I'd say it worked out pretty well for me, too, huh? What do you think? - What can I help you with tonight? - Well, as you know, I'm stayin' in this room right here tonight. Now, paparazzi catches wind to this or some crazy fans and it's gonna be hard for a fellow to get some sleep, you know what I'm saying? - Sure. - Now I need you to keep an extra special eye on this door right here. Can you do that for me? - Yes, sir. I got you covered. I'll guard it with my life. - Stillwater alumni. That's, that's really somethin'. - All right. - 'Preciate it. - It's George. Leave a message. - Hey, George. It's, uh, it's Troyal. I just, just got here in Nashville. I'm at the Himbassy Suite, or the Embassy Suites. Almost said Hilton. Uh, it's, it's pretty cool, man. It's kind of themed out. They got, uh, old concert posters. They got a Waylon Jennings. I'm looking at a, a Johnny Cash poster over there. I bet there's a, bet there's a George Jones poster somewhere. I just, uh, haven't really done much investigating as I, as I said, I just got, just got into town, so, um, I guess you could give me a call back. Uh, you could call, er, let me see. I don't, I don't have a number here, but I can, well, let me, how can I do this? I'll put the phone down or, hold on. All right. It's, uh, 1615, that's the room number. So, uh, 1615, you call the front desk at the, uh, Embassy Suites and that's, uh, they'll get you to 1615. That'll be the, that's my room number. Uh... Tell you what I'm gettin' pretty, pretty inspired here. This is, uh, this, it's really something. - Damn, cocksuckin'... - Hello? - Clint? - Yeah. This, this is Troyal. - Meet me at the Paddock Club in 15. - Ha, I, yes, sir. Yep. I'll, I, I can be there, I can be there real quick. I'll be there, just gotta... Uh, hello? Hello? All right. There he is. Hey, I'm, it's me, Troyal. Nah, he knows, he's gonna meet me there. Uh, say, don't you owe me a couple of bucks? Or, say, say, don't you owe me a five-spot? Or a cool, a cool spot? Or. Stupid. Hey, good-lookin'! No, that's, that's queer. Hey, did, didn't I read about you in the funny pa, yeah. Hey, didn't I read about you in the funny papers? All right. - Here you are, sir. - Thank you. - Mr. Jones. - Mmm. Howdy. Have a seat. How was your flight? - Well, I'll let you be the judge of that when I tell you I flew private, so... - That's nice. I hadn't left East Texas for several years 'til last week, and kind of forgotten how nice it was. - Well, I count my blessings every day for my success. - Do ya? - Yeah, of course. - Yeah, that's right. Good ol' boy. That's what you're into, isn't it? - Uh, yes, sir. I'm just a Oklahoma boy done good, y'know? My state's proud of me, I'm proud of myself. And my success is, of course, you gotta understand what that's like. I mean, you gotta be proud of yourself. - Oh, I don't know that pride has very much to do with it. I've lived a long life, son. There's been a lot of ebb and flow. I don't have too much pride in my own accomplishments. It's, I find I have pride in other people's accomplishments. You know, like, like you or somethin', and not myself. - I gotta say, Mr. Jones, it's sittin' across from you, you know, a country legend like you, and, it's pretty surreal. Then you telling me that you're proud of me, that makes me feel really good. - No. No, no, no. I was just using you as an example in the sentence of something to be proud of that was not myself. No. I don't know if I could be proud of your accomplishments anyway. They're a little bit too much like my own accomplishments. Now, that'd be kinda like arrogance, wouldn't it? And, uh, that's not very good ol' boy. You get what I'm sayin'? - Yeah, I think I smell what you're stepping in. - Yeah. I, I'm hungry. Wanna go ahead and order? - Sure. - Waiter. Let's skip the appetizers and go straight to the main course, that okay with you? - Hey, it's your world, man. I'm just livin' in it. I'm gonna have whatever Mr. Jones is havin'. - I want the filet. Rare. Baked potato. - Yes, sir. - And I'd like to amend my last statement. I would like exactly what Mr. Jones is havin', except for I'd like my steak cooked well-done. - Hmm. You really are from Oklahoma, aren't you? - I believe I am. Yeah. - Well-done, huh? - Yes sir, I like the cow, uh, good and dead. - You're really into this good ol' boy act, aren't you? - Well, I mean, you put a nice steak in front of me or a chicken-fried steak, I'm gonna go with the chicken-fried every time. That's just, that's just how I roll. - Yeah, but you cook the flavor right out of it. - I, I don't like the blood. - The blood's where the flavor is, son. You know, you've insulted the chef, right? - How'd I do that? - I mean, a chef will cook a well-done steak, but they do so begrudgingly. And, see, the chef will pull the order for a well-done steak and balk at it with the rest of the kitchen staff. At first, they'll, they'll be angry as a mongoose, but that'll turn to outright mockery at the guest's expense. And that means you, Troyal. - Oh, damn. - So they move that soon-to-be-forsaken meat to the hottest part of the grill, trying to, you know, push it along, cursing all the while. Then, it becomes a race to see how many real steaks they can cook in the ungodly amount of time it takes to cook that one bastard child. - Well, how long does it take to cook your steak? - Eh, two, maybe three minutes. - Oh, yeah. Damn. I, I can't do that. - So just before your steak is burned up into a sick little lump of char, mine will delicately and ever so graciously emerge as a culinary masterpiece. Tender, juicy, and rich, that, most of all, remains in its God-given pure form. - Why don't you just eat it raw? - Well, a few minutes on the grill is what separates us from the animals. - Well, I never thought about it like that, Mr. Jones. - Ah, well. Oh, I'm sorry. There's the wine, have yourself a pour. - Don't mind if I do. - It's a seven-year-old P & V. It's pourin' pretty good right now. - Mm. Yeah, that's, that's nice. That's real interesting. You know, I like to drink. I drink a lot, you know, beer or whiskey or wine, you know, whatever you put in front of me, I, some would say I have a problem. Drinkin' problem, like you, well, not like you. Wait here, hold on. I got something for you. - Oh. What are you gonna do next, boy? Get down on one knee? - No, these are, these are cuff links. They're belonged to Hank Williams. Senior. - Well, hell yes, Hank Williams Senior. Ah. Son, maybe you, uh, maybe you better hold onto those. - No, I got 'em for you, Mr. Jones. - Oh, that's very thoughtful. But I really, I really can't accept 'em. Listen. Listen, Troyal. I know I was kind of vague in my letter about my trip and I'm sorry, but I meant to do that. It's just not somethin' that I want broadcast. - Well, you can trust me, Mr. Jones. You can, you can certainly trust me with a secret. - Well, uh, for starters, I'm on the outs with Bev again. - I'm sorry to hear that. - That kind, patient, life-savin' woman has finally kicked me out. And, uh, as far as the trip goes, you ever heard of cryonics? - I don't think so. - It has to do with the freezing and storage of a human corpse. The idea is that resurrection might be scientifically possible at some later date. - Like Walt Disney. - Exactly like Walt Disney. Troyal, I'm sick. It's my heart. - I didn't know that. - Yeah, some days it's okay. And then, other days it's not so good. - So you're thinking about getting frozen? - I've done all the thinkin'. I'm goin' in tomorrow morning. - Well, what if somethin' goes wrong? What if you die? - Everything's a risk, ain't it? I mean, I'm just tired of living on my past. On my last night on Earth, I wanted to see what the future looks like. And, for better or worse, I believe that that is you. - So you're sayin', it's your last night on planet Earth, and you wanna spend it with me? - Well, I hadn't actually put a lot of thought into it, but yeah. - Well, God dog. That's wild, man. Cheers! - Rare. And very well-done. - Uh, listen, real, real quick, I just wanna say I'm really sorry. I did not mean to disrespect you by asking for a well-done steak. - I don't know what you're talking about. ♪ Sodom and Gomorrah wouldn't seem so bad ♪ ♪ Debbie, you know, I'm tryin' ♪ - Hey, P-Wee, slow night tonight? - Seems to be the case. - I was hopin' it would be. How are you, friend? - Doin' good, thank you. - Got a buddy with me tonight. You recognize him at all? - I can't say that I do. - Take that. That's what I like about you, P-Wee. You're a classic and you always will be. - Only way God made me, thank you. - Well, god damn. I thought I'd see you here. - George. How are ya? - I'm fairly well. - Didn't I read about you in the funny papers? - Troyal, I want you to meet Juno. Juno is a very talented individual. - You a musician? - Hell, Troyal, it's Nashville. Everybody down here's a musician. No, Juno's not much of a piano player. But he does have other talents that prove to be very useful. Won't you join us at our table? - I'm ready to go back to the hotel. - But this is where the country stars come to write their drinking songs. - I don't see any country stars. All I see are a bunch of lowlifes. I'm gonna go and start the car. - No, just give it a few minutes. Have another beer. - I don't want another beer. I want to be clearheaded. - Well then, go get some pretzels at the bar. Whatever. Let's stay a few minutes. - Man, it is a bad place to work for a recovering alcoholic. I will tell you that much. - They tell me that my ass was coverin' the drain so no water would go down it. I was just lucky that the suction from the drain didn't gut me. I was luckier still that my road manager found me just as I was gettin' ready to turn blue. - So, so you missed the show? - I sure did. And I felt really bad about it. Back in those days, people would drive hundreds of miles from these little farm towns to come see the, the shows, and, and I'd do some stupid shit like that. The promoter had to give 'em, uh, a, a voucher? For some future show. I don't know, but the fans still had faith in me, though. Even to this day, I don't understand why. You know, I, I would apologize to every single one of them if I could. I was a mess back in those days. Heh! - Well, shoot, I'm just, I'm glad you're still alive. - Well, it's not from lack of trying to not be. You know, I won all the awards. I'm not braggin'. I won 'em. I know you won a bunch, too. But a lot of those are ones that just got made up in the last year or two. And that's just, like, the Country Music Association, television, whatever. George Strait. Straight! My ass! Anyways, it's easier to win an award that just got made up in the last year. 'Cause you just have to show 'em somethin' new. I mean, no offense, it's like country music dressin' up. Or dressin' down, maybe. Tryin' to be something that it ain't and never will be. Rock and roll. - I like CCR. - Now see there's a, CCR. That's, that's a good band. - Well, see? Now, that there is the reason that I don't got no friends! That's just the way I like it. 'Cause I'd just turn around and stab a knife in your back some time when you weren't lookin'. Ain't that right, Juno? - That's right, George. - You son of a bitch. But I like it like that. You know, there's, there's true things that are terrible and there are terrible things that are true. I, I'mma tell you another story. This is a true story and I have never told a living soul about this. It was about one time when I was in a tight spot with the mob. I was up in New York City, which was probably my first mistake. - I don't know how to describe this guy. He's either a spic, Rican, wetback, ahh, Spaniard. He's a Mexican. - Well, what, what does this, uh, Mexican do for a livin'? - He sells drugs to children and their mothers, his own fuckin' neighborhood. And with them, it's always, he wants to kill this. He wants to do that. Whores up the kazoo. - We need to put some poison down this motherfucker's throat. - That's right. That's right. - Uh, alright. Uh, but uh, what's this got to do with me? I mean, uh, uh, what do you want me to do about it? - We think you can help us. - Now, look, you owe us quite a bit of money. Hey, Marty, how much is it? - 30 big one. That's lots of money. What the... - 30,000 dollars? - I know. I think we're crossin' some lines here. I'm a country singer. I'm not a, uh, whatever it is you think I am. - You're nothin' but a damn degenerate. - Okay. But I am not a killer. - Yeah? What'd you do in, uh, Korea? KP duty? - What's it gonna be? - They had me by the balls. I didn't have anyone I could turn to. Not to mention I was dead broke at the time. - So you went through with it? - What choice did I have? - You killed a man. - I'm not saying I'm proud of it, but it was him or me, so, yeah, I done it. I snuck in there when he was making it with his woman. - Sounds like somethin' that'd be hard to keep to yourself. Somethin' that would eat you up inside. - You work it out with your music, with your art. That's how you blow the dust off your soul when the world crashes in on top of you and tries to bury your ass. That's how you crazy glue the pieces back together after somebody's ripped your heart out and stomped all over it. It's why God made us artists. Everyone. It doesn't matter if you are number one, or number one million in one. Everybody is an artist. I believe that. Everybody is an artist. - My wife sings in the choir every Sunday. - Well, mine too. - I believe in Him. - Everybody is an artist. - I do too. What's your point? - I would like brandy. - Everybody is an artist. - And he will have a glass of beer. - Everybody is an artist. - It's showtime, motherfuckers. - What about me? Am I an artist? - Oh, you are an artist. I'm sure as shit you're an artist. You're the most... - You know, Connie here, she's a singer. Maybe y'all can do a duet together. - Oh, you're a singer? - Yeah. Been singing all my life, but ain't nobody found me yet. - So it, it's Connie. And... - Donna. - Donna. - And that is Sueleen. Sign of the times. - Howdy, y'all. - Matched trio. Thank the Lord for numerical coincidences. - Troyal, you gonna sing us a song tonight? - Uh, hadn't planned on it, but how 'bout a autograph? I could do, I could do an autograph for you. - I think I'd like that. - It's like my daddy taught me. The world will not let you scream, so you better learn to sing. - That's beautiful. - And he underlined the point by making me sing on command or he'd beat the shit outta me. - Oh, you poor baby. Did he beat you horrible? - Oh, Miss Donna? He beat me horrible. - Oh. - Oh, I'll, I'll pass on that. I'll go ahead and, just... - Come on, Troyal. We're tryin' to have a celebration here. - Yeah, come on. Don't be a sourpuss. - Oh, no, no, no, see, I don't, I don't, uh, I don't mess with this. This isn't one of my favorite. This is, like a light beer? Like, I can do light beer. I can drink plenty of those. - Now, I have seen you up on stage, grinnin' like an Oklahoma jackpot. - Ugh! Come on, Juno! You're gonna act like a fool, people are gonna treat you like a fool. You got this. Let's go. - Mmm. Beans. All right. Oh. Beans, two nights in a row. Hey, that ain't bad, huh, Ma? Uh, let's get you a scoop here, and a scoop for me over here. - You bet. - Hey, Ma, guess what? I went to P-Wee's old place right after work. Ran into Trey. We get to playing a round o' pool and get to talkin' about the Memphis game. About halfway through the conversation, I realize, wait a minute, Trey doesn't own a TV. That's when he tells me that he installed an antenna on his roof last week. I told him about your situation. Trey is volunteering to install the antenna on your roof next week. How does that sound? - Sounds great, but I've already got Jack. - Who's Jack? - Jack Kennedy. He does a sound booth at church. You know Jack Kennedy. - Oh, the sound guy. Yeah, he's a good man. He's gonna come by? - Mm-hmm. - Well, wh, what day, I gotta tell Trey this. - He'll have to come on a Sunday because he works the other six days. - Just let me know when he comes by, okay? I wanna be here for that. - Okay. - I know how you get, you wanna be very helpful. You want to help out and you end up straining something. So, let me be that person to strain something, all right? - You'll just be in the way. - I understand that. I just wanna help you, all right? I just wanna help you. - You'll be in the way. - End o' discussion. I just wanna help ya, Ma. - He's full up. He's got enough. - I just want to help ya. That's it. That's all. I just want to help you. - You'll be in the way. You understand? You'll be in the way. - I would be in the way, wouldn't I? I always seem to be in the way. - I'm... - Sorry, you'll be in the way. - I'm always in the way, aren't I? - Takes all kind to make the world, I guess. - You'll have to excuse me for a minute. - Now, what's the chance of those two, havin' a drink, bein' together in this bar? - That's the whole point, knucklehead. They come here for this reason. All, all the stars. - Well, it ain't them. - I'm gonna go get a picture.. - God damn it, Ethel, you're gonna embarrass me. Sit your ass down. - But you know who those boys idolize? - Dad's home! - Their father. - Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't realize there was someone else in here. - Anyone can be in here as far as I'm concerned. It's 1994. And you know what that means? In six years, all these noisy machines are gonna shut down, and all of this is gonna cease to exist. - Okay? - What's the matter? You seem upset. - I'm not upset. - You say so. You need to trust that home is what you make it. And you can be anyone you want to be, this time around. - Troyal, Troyal, Troyal. What would you say to a night with a real country girl? - I'm married. - Of course. All the best ones are. - You mind if I use the phone? - Is it gonna be a local call? - Actually no, I'm callin' home. Here. I'll give you $10. How'd that be? - Been a lot of counterfeitin' going on around here. Looks legitimate, though. I'll give you a minute. - Thank you. How you doin'? - I feel like we're losin' you. - Thanks. - Certainly, certainly. - Share and share alike. - Hey, ladies, get that over here. - Oh, yeah? - Oh, we're gonna have a party now. - Yeah. - Yeah! - Ooh! - Oh, no, no, ma'am, ma'am. No, you, you, you can't, you can't have a picture. - Well, well, it's my camera. - Just hold on a minute, sonny. - I can take all the photos I want. - You're gonna have to give me that camera. - Oh no, I will not, I can... - Here, let, I'm gonna give you, I got some money. I will give. - It's not for sale. - I'll give you 300 dollars. - It's worth a lot more than that. - Bud. Why don't you pick on somebody your own size. - Those pictures, are personal property of ours. - Okay, this is just a big misunderstanding. And they just happen to have something that doesn't belong to them. - Listen. - I don't know who you guys think you are, with your loud shirts and your loud talk and all the drug use, but this is my bar. I own this bar. And you ain't Nashville. - P-Wee, hang on now. We're, we're gonna get this calmed down. Just a misunderstanding. - George, I love you, but you've been wearin' on me for like 10 days straight. Ya ain't Nashville either, man. - Now, hold on, god damn it. - God damn it, P-Wee, ya piece of shit. Fuck you, P-Wee. - Okay. - Okay, here's what we're gonna do. I'm gonna go ahead and take this. - Oh! No! Oh! - Ladies, that is our cue. - I'm gonna go ahead and give you this, and I want you all to have a really nice night. - Oh. - Keep buying the records. - George. Don't come back for at least a week. You understand? - Oo-wee! - Not bad for an old guy, huh? - What, you mean to tell me we ain't the same age? This night's just nearly perfect. I bet you can hear the coyotes howlin' out here, huh? - Yeah, there's more scavengers every year. - It's a damn beautiful world, though. You sure you don't feel like stickin' around? ♪ Let me introduce to you ♪ ♪ A woman with a dream ♪ - You're awful mopey tonight. - I was just thinkin', is all. - 'Bout what? - 'Bout somethin' I lost. Long time ago. - I'm listenin'. - I was thinking about life and, and time. And how weeks turn into months and, and months turn into years. And before you know it, your, your kids are all grown up and, and you're old and wrinkly, and everyone's forgotten about you. I'm sorry I was impolite at the bar earlier. I, I know I get like that sometimes and I don't... - Oh, no. Sorry if I was. - I was just really lookin' forward to this trip. Y'know, I was really lookin' forward to meeting my hero George Jones. Now that I've met him, I'll, I'll never get to see him again. If all this cryogenics talk is true, which I mean at this point, who's to say? Y'know, you can hear it in his songs, but comin' face to face with him. That's, that's when you really realize that, that he's in, in pain. - You do know that George Jones is a piece of shit. - Well, we're gonna have to agree to disagree on that one. I think George Jones is a genius. - Was a genius. Now he ain't nothin' but a washed-up degenerate. Cryonics. Hell. He ain't Walt Disney. And he ain't half the songwriter you're gonna be. - I appreciate that, but... - But nothing. Appreciate what you got and shut up. Most people got nothin' like it. You have no idea what all you could have, do you? I can do things for you, Troyal. Things you couldn't even dream of. Boo! - You all right, man? - Imagine seeing yourself as a different self, living a different life, but a life not so different from your own. We're talking about alternate dimensions here. You know, standing upon the precipice of reality, gazing upon a horizonless valley of infinite cells. Each one with its own opinion, thought, passion, desire. Y'know, once you're able to glean on this notion of alternate timelines, then you'll begin to understand what it was like for Spock to be born and raised in a Vulcan society. But, to put a finer point on it, you finally understand the leadership qualities that it takes to captain a Starship Enterprise. Qualities like, uh, like Captain Tiberius Kirk had, or Jean-Luc Picard. Shooting star. You know, captains who actually had a Vulcan mind-meld. - Sounds like a good show. - Oh man, yeah. And the Vulcan mind-meld? We're not just talking about some fuckin', uh, Freaky Friday situation. We're talking about the entire thing. Right? Head to toe, from the beginning nerve end to the next, to the end. We're talkin' about, Deni. Oh my God, fuckin' Denise, uh, Denise Crosby? The fact that she went back to those studio execs and told her that she wanted to reprise the role of, uh, Tasha, of, uh, fuckin' Tasha. Uh, fuckin', uh, Tasha Yar on the Starship Enterprise. I mean, the fuckin' balls on that woman. I mean, the fact that she played a Romulan consort, but also played her own fuckin' daughter? Fuckin' wild, man. - I'll bet you ladies are licensed massage therapists. - Now, how did you know that? - Just a hunch. - Troyal, have you ever had a massage? - Nah, I don't, I don't think so. - It'll change your life, brother. - Connie? We should definitely give Troyal a massage. - How 'bout it, Troyal? You want a massage? - You're a star, son. You deserve it. Why don't you show these ladies your fancy Nashville hotel suite? - Fuck it. - So, basically. Uh, Dr. Hammond, uh, and he's cloning dinosaurs on this island, right? - This one feels real nice, but tight in the neck and shoulders. - Dinosaurs. - This one skin's all loose like, but his muscles? - But that's the whole point of the movie. - Sure are hard. - Like leather. - Nah. Like velvet. - Yeah? - Yeah, yeah! The ones with all the cute boys on the front. - Oh yeah, who's cool now? JTT? - Yeah. - Yeah, I know about JTT! You impressed? - This is it, isn't it? The lap of luxury. - I mean, I guess it's all right, if this is what you're into. - It's nights like this that I am really going to miss when I am not in this world. - What happens if you get out and everything's different? - The skies could fall and the rivers turn to blood, but there will always be country music! - Yeah, but, what if, what if everybody just forgot about you? - No, nobody forgets a true artist. They forget the, the theatrics and the, the glitz and the glamour. They forget the sizzle, but they still hunger for the steak. And nobody cares about music that's got no substance, songs without a soul. - I know you ain't talkin' 'bout my music, Mr. Jones, 'cause top of the pops, man, my shit is legit. - No, I wasn't talkin' about you. Although, I don't really know. I've never heard any of your tunes. - Whattya mean, you ain't never heard any of my tunes, man? I thought you were a fan! Shit, I've heard all your songs. - Ah, I just don't listen to much music anymore. - That's just downright disrespectful, man. - Well. Why don't you sing me something? - Just right now, with no music? - No, there's no better time.

What the hell are you doin'? - What the fuck does it look like I'm doin', peckerwood? - Okay. All right! That's it! - Baby, baby, you just sit back and let me take care of you. - No, no. Party's over. Everybody's out. Party's over! - God damn it! - You need to lighten up! - You need to learn to relax. - No, honey, it's okay. No, I think it's plain as day. This one don't like women. Come on, girls. - That's a bunch of bullshit. - Fantastic. That, that means you, come on, get up. - Oh, shit. George, listen, uh, we weren't expecting any of this. Uh, ya got any singles, fives, uh, anything for cab fare? - I ain't got nothin' but big bills. - God damn it! Is anything gonna go right today? Well, I just don't know what to do. - Here, take that. $20. - Troyal, you're a good man. I'm gonna get you back. - Nope, I don't need to be gotten back. Just, just leave. - No. George will tell you, I'm good for it. George, tell him. - Well, yeah. - Okay. Just go. - I think we're sayin' the same thing is all I'm sayin'. George, take care. - Leave. - Finally. I thought they'd never leave. - You just don't get it, Mr. Jones. I mean, you're like a hero to me. You invite me up here to Nashville, to be my friend. I mean, that means the world to me. You've been an inspiration to me. You've been an inspiration to everyone. But now I see you're, you're just bullshit. - I'm not bullshit. You're bullshit. - At least I'm not a liar. - Your whole life is a lie. - How's my life a lie? - You're lying to yourself. You're a god damn star and you can do anything you want. And you got yourself fenced in this little tiny pod like some pussy-ass coward. - I'm not a coward, Mr. Jones. You know what I am? I'm a loyal, faithful, good ol' boy. Big star. What's that gotten you? It ain't enough! - It's never enough. It's never ever enough. And who cares if it's truth or lies? The truth is just a last resort anyway. It doesn't even really exist anymore. Not now, especially. Just some bullshit story somebody told once, and it doesn't even matter who. Does that offend your sensibilities? Does that disrupt your conscience? Me, I ain't got a conscience. I, I, I'm just a pipe for fluids to pass through. You put your heart and your soul into your music, and, and, people just want to, they just want to gobble ya up, they just want to eat it. They eat the shit outta your godforsaken soul! Everybody loves the music! And all the time they're just tellin' you they're hungry. More! More! And they crowd around you. And it's re, record label people and, and, and journalists and, and managers and this constant stream o' women. And they're all sayin' more, more, more! And, shit! What, what kind of a songwriter am I when I can't even stand my own songs? It's god damn torture! I'd rather have a boilin' case of hemorrhoids than write a song. I thought my music could make people better. Nobody needs me anymore. After tomorrow, they have to find somebody else to devour. And try to change people but they, they changed me into their image. Ah! The future used to be tomorrow, and now it's today and, and, nobody's ready. And no one wants to know anything! They just wanna, to, to feed like hogs at the trough. - Why don't you just get frozen then? Maybe you'll live a hundred years. - Yeah, why not forever? I could be the wandering minstrel! What the hell do you know, anyway? You, you gimme back those Hank Williams cuff links. You don't deserve 'em I knew the man, god damn it, he'd be spinning in his grave thinking of you. - Well, that's not really that big of a dis, George. 'Cause I got 'em for you anyway. - It is Mr. Jones to you. You don't get to talk to me like that and then pretend that you're my pal, my, my equal. That song you sang was just damn terrible, boy. - Well, first off, there was no musical accompaniment. And secondly, I'm not even finished writing it. - Well, don't bother. It's shit. - You take that back. - Oh yeah? Fuck you. - Fuck you. - Fuck you! This is not how I wanted to spend my last night. - You think this is how I want to spend any night? - Now you're gonna tell me I have to leave. - Well, yeah, I do think it'd be a good idea if you left. - Just hang me out to dry like everybody else. See if I care. - Jesus. - You haven't learned what it's like yet, being up in that spotlight. You think they can see you, but they can't really see you. It's so cold up there, it's like you're walking on the moon. - I mean, yeah, I understand. It gets lonely. - Ah. After tomorrow, you won't have to worry about seein' me around anymore. - What do you want from me, Mr. Jones? - I envy you. - You, oh, you envy me. - I gotta spell it out for you? - What do you mean you envy me? - You got everything in front of you. You got your, your whole life, and your whole career, and all these opportunities to make great things for yourself and I see you doin' it. And, and I wish it was me again, knowin' what I know now. Make better choices and not fuck things up. Put my head better on my shoulders like I see you doin'. That's why I'm gonna freeze myself tomorrow, 'cause then hopefully I can come back, and make a strong finish in, you know, twenty or fifty or a hundred years when all the people that I've harmed are dead or moved on. That, and I need the rest. - Look, look, George. You don't need to get frozen for that. You just need to get therapy, rehab, somethin', shit. Get clean, man. I'll pay for it. - No, it's over for me. I'm just a tired, sick, old man. - It's not over for you. It's not over for anyone until it's over, and it ain't over yet. - Oh, God. Who's that? Are you expecting someone? - That's probably your friend Juno. - I don't want to see him. - I'll tell him to get lost. - Evening, Mr. Brux. - How are ya? - How's that quiet evening going for you? - Not as quiet as I'd hoped. - Hmm. People fighting in there? - Had, had some people over, but, you know, they're, they're not here anymore. - Just we've had some complaints about some shouting, so... - Yeah, like I said, they're, they're long gone at this point, so nothin' to worry about. - How 'bout that old man that came in after you? He seemed a little messed up on the way in. - You know, we had some beers out in the town, but that's perfectly legal in the state of Nashville. From what I understand. I haven't read every law book. - Let me ask you somethin'. You gonna break any more shit in your hotel room? - I'm really sorry about that. Here, let me, let me give you a little somethin'. No, no, no. - It's fine. - You know, I never really got your name. - I imagine that comes with the territory. - I'd sure like to know it. - Let's just say I'm somebody you used to know. You have a good evening, Mr. Brux. - You've been a good friend to me, Troyal. - I believe every man has a path to redemption. - Mm. Did I ever tell you about that time I did undercover work with the FBI? - I don't think I heard that one yet. - It's good. I can hear everything. - All right, George. Remember, if you feel like you're in any danger, you use the code word. You remember the code word, right? - Of course. - I know this ain't easy, but you're doing it for your country. It's the price of freedom. - Let's get it over with 'fore I change my mind. - Hm. - All right. - All right. All right, let's rock and roll. So, Mr. Jones, I cannot tell you how pleased I am that you've taken an interest in our movement. Someone of your stature. Someone all of America loves and respects, young and old alike! Oh, I want you to meet Luiz. Luiz, do you have a moment to meet a country and western legend? - Oh, yes. - I thought so. Mr. Jones, this is Luiz. - Mr. Jones, I love the country music. Thank you for opening your heart to the suffering of my people. - Thank you, Luiz. So, luckily, we were able to get Luiz and most of his family out of the country, but sadly, many of his relatives remain. The actions of this administration contributing to violence over there have been deplorable, to say the least. It's a story that must be told. And hopefully with your help, we can bring this abomination to the attention of the American people and stop this madness. That's where you come in. So, as most people know, our current president has a certain cowboy sensibility. I'm told that he adores your music and admires you very much. Our sources tell us he would very much enjoy meeting, as well as a photo op with you. And then, about a week after that, we're hoping you would make a statement against American-sanctioned violence throughout Latin America. People would listen to you, Mr. Jones, and you could help turn the tide. We most certainly believe they would listen, Mr. Jones. Your influence is considerable. Now, if you agree to this, we have a congressional contact that could assist you in getting a meeting with President Reagan. After you meet with him, we would time the release of certain CIA documents we've managed to obtain to the New York Times and other press outlets. Now, we expect a certain amount of public outcry in wake of these revelations. But with your prominent support, we could turn that into a tidal wave and very possibly move the needle finally towards some sort of justice for these dispossessed people and accountability for these neofascist monsters. You'd be doing the world a favor. Mr. Jones. - Tree tops. - Tree tops. - Tree tops? - Tree tops. - Fuck! - Is that enough? - I guess it's gonna have to be. Let's go. All right, this is a raid! Everybody down! - Is that a true story, Mr. Jones? - Call me George. It's time, son. - Hey, George. I just wanted to say, I still think you're a legend. - Thank you, Troyal. That means a lot to me. You know, there's two ways that you can secure your legacy. One is have yourself frozen in time. The other is to completely reinvent yourself. Take care, son. - Let's go. I don't know why I wandered into this part of Texas, drunk. When you took me in, pitied me, helped me to straighten out. Married me. Why? Why did this happen? - Showtime, Champ. - I'll in be there in a second. - You know, a man always doing his best becomes a natural leader, just by example. - Is that another Joe DiMaggio quote? - Yeah, that's old Joe. - Well, that's nice. - Hey, um, I'm real proud of you, Troyal. - I 'preciate it. - Now, I know we've had the conversation before, but, uh, um, I thought I'd bring it up one more time. It's, uh, it's about these, these gold boots. - I told you before, I'm not gonna wear those gold boots. They don't go with my cowboy image. - Well, we did the focus groups and they, they're still boots and... - Man, I don't care. I need shit-kickin' boots, man. You're not gonna lead a steer to a feed trough wearin' gold boots, looks stupid. - Well, I, I hear ya, um, but you, you know, John Fogerty wore these boots. - John Fogerty of CCR? - Mm-hmm. - Well, set 'em on the counter on your way out. Son of a bitch! Huh! Huh! God damn superstar. Showtime, motherfuckers. Well, Troyal, everything seems to be going pretty well in your world. You have the number one record in America right now, a beautiful family, and what looks to be a bun in the oven. - Well. God, He's smiled down on me. He's, He's blessed me with a wonderful, nurturing wife and of course these little fuckers. - And we're just really glad to have him home. - Well, you have managed to do something that most artists can't quite get a grasp on. You're keeping your music fresh. Now, one could say that you are staying with the times so much that you've become timeless. Now, someone as content as yourself, how are you able to keep your finger on the pulse of what the people want? - Well, I think the, the important thing to, is to stay relatable in, in my music, y'know? Make the material, uh, really resonate with folks, uh, of all, of all kinds of different backgrounds. You know, I do that by just understanding them, knowing who they are, who, who everyone is. - Oh! Wow! I just, I just got goosebumps. - Right? Well, that's what I do. You know, that's what I do to people. I, I create feelings in them that they didn't even know they had.
