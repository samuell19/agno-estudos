FIRST STORY "Sharona Honey" I had a dream. Did you enjoy it? A lot. And you? Then... how will it end? The dream? The way we want it to end. I have a driving lesson at 8:30 a.m. What time is it? -9 a.m. -9 a.m.?! Watch it, honey. "Honey" your mother. Maybe you'll drive. I'm under terrible pressure. I forgot about the photo sessions. Sharona, it's your test tomorrow, not mine. -You're angry. -Angry? Of course not. What's all this garbage in the streets? Didn't you hear about the strike? Where've you been? I think I'm pregnant. -Well, who's the father? -Come on. -Not the guy from last night? -Are you following me? So, it's your boyfriend you fought with. -How would you know? -Then you threw him out. -How would you know? -You disappeared. -How would you know? -How would I? -You saw him? -Saw who? Yonathan! When? Where? How was he... Tell me the details. Yesterday, in my bar. He looked like a wreck. Keep driving. -Did you talk to him? Was he alone? -Yes, yes. Drive! -Yes what?! -Drive already! Here is this fool. Sharona, hey. Oh, Michaela, hey. Bye. Have you heard that Otto is coming to Tel Aviv today? -So? -Just thought you'd like to know. I have some great makeup that would really cover it. It shows? "Shows" is an understatement, don't you think? She needs a cast, not makeup. What? What's the look? Romantic, antique...? Wow, fantastic. Amazing. I'm not sure. Melancholy, romantic, autumny... Give me all of these. I'm late. Mikki will kill me. Say, honey, aren't you having too much of a good time? Good time? I'm going to get killed tonight. Again? Bye. No, no, no. Take care of yourself. Leave it. -Fine, okay. -I don't know, that Michaela. Every time I see her, I feel like slapping her. Tell me, does it show? No. With Sharona. Wait. Where to now? To Oberson, to pick up some dresses. It'll take about half an hour. -Tell me, did he do that to you? -What? That bruise on your neck. He did it? -Does it really show? -Yes, it shows. Relax. What's wrong with you? Do you wanna kill someone? Yonathan will kill me. What will I do? Pray it won't leave a scar. Go already. You're late. The lady has arrived. Sharona, honey, what happened? Sharona, how are you? Tell me, how will it end? -Finally, the clothes arrived. -Nice scarf. What's with you? Mikki, I'm really sorry. What's the excuse this time? Otto? Yonathan? Erez? Or Bruce Springsteen? Today, I really tried not to be late. Yeah, I'm sure. This time, it's serious. I threw Yonathan out. -Well? -I wasn't home last night. -Well? -And I think he knows. Well? Wow, beautiful. -Well? -What? Yesterday? Last night? Was it Otto? Erez Buchwinder? Are you nuts? He's married. Gino. No. I thought it would never happen. Me neither. Isn't it beautiful? Was our last photo session at Hilton on the 28th? Wasn't it on the 30th? And today is the 5th? I've never been so late. It's been a week already. You haven't taken a test yet. Don't be so hysterical. -Limor, he's kicking. -What? Kick him back. Sharona, telephone. Oh, no. It's Yonathan. -Tell him you're busy. -I'm busy. Is it a guy? No, it's Otto. He says it's about the wedding. I don't have time to get married now. He should call tonight. Now, he'll get offended. I don't understand you. He's a great guy. I'd marry him tomorrow. -I can't. Tomorrow is my driving test. -Driving test?! I'd marry him. Who? Gino? What's happening? You're love-struck. No, Limor, it's different. He's not a psycho, he's not a baby. He doesn't try to change me into something else. He's not... -He doesn't breathe down my neck. -So, what's on your neck? Bird poop? Let me see. Yonathan will kill you and then kill himself. It's not funny. I'm afraid to go home. He's dangerous. Leave a message for Sharona and Yonathan after the beep. Yonathan... Yonathan, if you're there, answer me. Are you there? Yonathan. You forgot the keys. They'll be at Erez's bar at ten, and so will I. Sharona -Hello? -So, are you alive? Hardly. I'm standing on my balcony. I can see my keys, a letter from Yonathan, I can't get in. I'm so tense, I could smash the flowerpots. You're on the phone accidentally left on the balcony. Right, genius. God loves me. And where are your keys? They'll be waiting for me in your bar at ten. I'd come help you, but I'm in the middle of a lesson. Can you manage? I have another photo session soon, dressing some baby. So, leave now. They'll be amazed if you're on time. Yonathan. I'm coming up! Don't you dare. I'm coming down. Otto, I'm exhausted. I can't go on anymore. I've missed you so much. -I'm locked out. It's so unfair. -Why didn't you say so? I can break in. Forget it. It's too complicated. I'll have the keys in two hours. Are you sure? Yes, though I'd shower right here in the street. A real bath? Come on, it's across the street. I know you. You'd sell your mother for a shower. So this is where the monster lives. Sorry, I mean your friend. She really loves herself. Shut up. Want something to drink? Look, she can see right into my living room. Are these binoculars? I can't believe it. She has no boundaries. Did you know about this? Me? No. No! Since when are you shy in my presence? Leave me alone, Otto. I'm busy. I need an answer. You promised me an answer. Don't start with all the wedding stuff again. Otto? What now? Thailand, Acapulco, Kuwait? Paris. Do you remember our Paris dream? Winter, fireplace, chestnuts? You promised me. Otto, I'm not going to Paris now. I'm not marrying you. We broke up two years ago. How long will it take you to understand? 20 years? And take your hand out! What do you do with your psychologist? Mess around? His license must be revoked, really. What's this? My plan was to join you in the tub and celebrate our trip before you started with your nonsense. Don't come near me. Hey. Hey. -Bye. -Bye. I go into the bar, see Gino and Yonathan in front of him. I take the keys from Gino, introduce them, and say, "Listen, about Sharona--" Great. But remember, if you see the jeep, keep driving. Keep driving. -You see the jeep? -If I do, I keep driving. No, idiot, that's a question. Do you see the jeep? Wait, wait, wait. At 10 p.m., I ID the suspect's jeep parking suspiciously near a pile of suspicious trash. -Do you see Yonathan? -No, I don't. Relax. Can I stop now? -If I don't come back... -Go already, monkey. She comes to my flat, fills the tub, and takes a bath. What a bitch. She left the tub a filthy mess. And full of hairs. Shit. Michaela. Yonathan! Yonathan! Who gave you a license? It's not funny, Yonathan. It's not funny at all. Hi, Skeetza Bar. -Who's this? Inbal? Hagit? -Hagit. Hagit, this is Sharona. Tell Erez I was kidnapped in his car. He shouldn't worry. I'll be right back. Take me back. Look, I can't live without you. I think about you all the time. I'm a wreck. I can't stand it anymore. I just can't take it anymore. Where were you last night? -And where were you last night? -I asked first. -I couldn't stay home after what happened. -So you went out to fuck? Look, I know you were out fucking. It doesn't bother me, okay? I just want to know with whom. So if it doesn't bother you, you can relax. Besides, you don't know him. I knew it, I knew it! So it's true you were fucking! I bought a house. Congratulations. I think I'm pregnant. -So this is the house you bought. -Pretty amazing, isn't it? Wait until winter. It'll be even more amazing. You, I, and the baby will sit in front of the fireplace. Yonathan, we're still fighting. I haven't made up with you yet. But I love you. So why do you drive me crazy? Because I love you. Do you love me? Enough, Yonathan. Let's take the car back. I need sleep. I don't even remember my own name. What's his name? I want to know his name. Whose name? The vampire who screwed you last night. His name. Gino. Gino. Yes. Italian? -I don't know. -Great. You fuck someone and don't even know if he's Italian. Okay, I'm leaving. No, I'm leaving. -Don't come back. -Don't worry. What? Good evening to the happy couple. -Erez, come. -What happened? Where are you? I'm alone with the car. And where's Yonathan? Oh, I get it. So are you coming? Wait, I have a better idea. It's not working. I'll die and you'll be to blame. Are they honking behind you or is it my imagination? I can't find second gear. Switch to third and pull straight back. I'm telling you, your car's a wreck. There's no fourth gear! Shut up! Try again. Clutch all the way and press to the right. Don't tell me what to do! Sharona. Sharona. Shut up! I'm busy! I don't wanna drive, I hate driving, I hate cars, and I hate you. You've got problems? Shit bricks. Are you okay? I'm near the Dolphinarium, approaching a light. -Red light? -Yes. -Are you managing? -I stopped. Well done. Look in the mirror. Closer. -Well? -Fix your hair. You look awful. -Erez... -What, it's green? -I don't feel well. -What happened? I think I got my period. -I'm going to the toilet. -Shout if you need any help. I'm next to my wife. Looking good, honey. Go to hell. Bitch. I hope she drops dead. Sharona. Sharona. Gino? Did you get it? What? The keys. Not yet. -Sharona, did you get... -The keys? No, "it." Yes. Sharona. Sharona, are you okay? -Sharona. -Yes. Baccardi cola for Sharona, keys for Sharona, and tea for my wife. Drink. Drink, drink. Are you sick? No, I'm actually not. Could you be a part of some scientific experiment and they just forgot to tell you about it? It's time you break up your psycho club and graduate. -You're worth more than that. -Erez. What? Why didn't you tell me Natalie was pregnant? Does it matter now? Your wife's pregnant and it doesn't matter now? Okay. Congratulations. Are you taking me home? I'm going to LA for two months. It's about the club I told you about. I want you to come with me. Styling there is different from here. It's a profession. You're good at it. You'll succeed. Why are you offering me this? -You know why. -No, I don't want to know. -Sharona. Sharona. Sharona. -Shut up! Shut up! I can't anymore. I've been in love with you for months. You think I hang out with you because I'm bored? -And what about Natalie? -She doesn't need to know. No, idiot. What about her and your great love? What about the baby? I would move this baby from her womb to yours. Wouldn't you want my baby? I thought you were my friend. -Shit. Yonathan is here. -I'll go up with you. Absolutely not. I'll deal with this myself. -But, Sharona... -No, thanks. I'll wait down here. Call me if there's a problem. Erez, do what you like. Yonathan. Yonathan, open up! Yonathan! Crazy, psycho, lunatic. Yonathan, let me in, please. Let's talk. Enough. Leave your speakers alone. What's this... No, not the photos from Eilat! Enough! No, no! I'm calling the police! I'll kill you, Yonathan! Yonathan. Don't touch my magazines. Don't you dare touch them, you crazy bastard! I'm coming in. I'll break the glass! What? Who is it? It's Michaela. Sorry to disturb you while you're busy. Since it's a matter of life and death, maybe you'll spare a moment. Your ex-boyfriend locked himself in my balcony with binoculars and a gun and won't come out unless you come. Lovely, Otto. Just fantastic. -What happened? -Nothing. You've turned him into a mental case and ruined his life. Move. Don't you charge a bit too much for a whore? Tell me, did I ever do you any harm? Stop breathing and it'll be less polluted around here. Drop dead. Look, the strike ended. Do you do this often? What? Peep into my house. Sometimes. Depends whether Michaela is home or if I can't resist it. Can't resist it. Aha. Otto. What? I don't love you anymore. Even if you put a bullet in your head, it won't help. I just don't love you. Let's have a baby. What baby? What baby? What's this baby stuff all the time? It might be a boy or a girl. You're not listening to me. You're not listening to me. Why don't you listen to me? What's the matter with you? Get off my back with your children, your Michaelas, your crises, and stop breathing down my neck. I'm sick of it! Enough! This is the last time you enter my flat. Even if I have to move. SECOND STORY "Operation Cat" Morning. I'm not dead. Amnon, where are you? You're probably lonely now like me. Who's there? Who's there? Amnon? Message for Zofit Sharon. Michal Ofenhaimer has been waiting for you for an hour at the gallery. Schnitzer says you should call editorial desk urgently. Message for Zofit. Michal O. has been waiting for you for an hour at the gallery. Schnitzer says you should call editorial desk urgently. -Who's there? -The movers. You said morning. I'm sorry, I can't now. Go in, go in. His wife had contractions. We took her to the hospital. No, no. I'm really sorry. I can't right now. Go away. I'm sorry. This is Israel, not Switzerland. I can't today. I have to go. You know what having a baby is like. Mazal Tov, congratulations. You could've at least given me a notice. We told them. You don't have a phone. What could we have done? Who is "them"? Amnon and what's-her-name, his friend... Elinoar. What kind of name is that? Elinoar? You're moving the stuff to her place? He's living with her? What, Amnon and Elinoar? That's impossible. I knew it. Listen, take everything! Stay, on the condition you take all his rubbish! I don't want anything that reminds me of him. What, take it all? All of it? Yes. Schnitzer? I'm sorry. I had a terrible night. Yes, I know what time it is. I had to interview Michal and Bohnar at noon. You sent me a taxi? Good. I'll do it as fast as possible. What, can't you lift that? You need the fire department for that. It's good and stuck here. Everything? All of it? Yes. Zofit. If it weren't for you, I'd have given an interview to someone else. Seems like dyslexia isn't a passing thing. My dear. Would you believe it? How many years has it been? -Do you have something to drink? -I'll go get it. Sorry I'm late. It's nothing, only an hour and a half of wasted time. What's the fire department's number? Your brain's burnt out? You could've taken the photos and left as usual. She didn't let me. She's been driving me nuts. -I heard you left Amnon. -She's been driving me nuts. Oh, well, then he left you. Does it matter? The most important thing is that you're not with that degenerate. You see? It's good you didn't get pregnant. Nature knows exactly what it's doing. When it comes, it comes. I know from experience. How do you know? A little bird told me. You know, when you were in NY, he tried to screw me. Good. Who? Your sick husband, that's who. You wrote poetry and he hung around with his tongue out. Okay. We can begin. Not even a pen. Jesus, how prepared are you? I have a tape. We can begin. It's very important they understand I love animals. All the slain rabbits, the stuffed crows... I'm drawn to this out of pain. For example... Okay. At the back entrance to the theater in one hour. One hour. Schnitzer wants a photo of her in the tub. Hello? Is it the fire department? Don't you dare be late. Your line was busy, so I just came. Busy? Listen, there's a cat trapped in a sewer drain. -A cat? -A kitten. I was told you could help me. He's not really mine, but I love him. Ah, love. I think there's a fire. You probably have to go there. Don't take it to heart. It's just a cat. Excuse me, where's the fire? Perhaps it's in my direction? I have a daughter your age. Are you married? Not exactly. Yes. Children? Not yet. Nothing's burning. Don't be sad. Maybe you can call the SPCA. -SPCA? -Yes. -Good luck, honey. -Thank you. What mortgage? Do you know how much child support I pay this tart? Look, I stand here all day, I'm hot and sweaty... What can I do? No, I can't. Hello? SPCA? Zofit Sharon speaking. I'm a journalist. What a beautiful entrance. I came to say I can't come. I have to wait for the SPCA to come and save my cat. Do you have money to lend me for the bus? My bankcard got swallowed in the ATM. Nice to meet you. Miriam Bohnar. Nice to meet you. I didn't realize how beautiful you are. Zofit Sharon, she's always like this. Fragile... and a poet. What color is the cat? Black and white. -Do you want to save it? -Yes. And you want to photograph me in the tub. -Yes. -Good. Then you'll have to wait until I get dirty. So take her where she needs to go and save the cat. Then come back, I'll take a bath, and you'll photograph. Continue the rehearsal. Do you need help? Sorry, you can't park here. -A cat is trapped in there. -Leave her. I'm waiting for the SPCA to come get it out. What's going on? -Do you live here? -I have for six months. I'm near-sighted. You're Zofit Sharon, right? How do you know? My group's singer told me. So you're the ones up there playing all the time. It doesn't bother me. It's actually nice. We composed music for one of your poems. You composed music? For which one? Someone whispered "Let's cross the river" And then tried to drown me -Oh, how strange. -Oh, how strange. We're having a rehearsal. Want to come up and listen? No, I'm waiting for the SPCA. They're coming to take you? 17 Netzach Israel? -I'm from the SPCA. -Excuse me? I'm from the SPCA. Where's the cat? You're by yourself? Yes. -I don't understand. -I brought a box. A box? You need a crane to get it out. I'll call it. Why the plastic? You'll smother him. I made holes. I always know when it'll rain. Rain? Today? Rain! Hey! Hey! It's not his fault, it's mine. I didn't let him park. Please, he wanted to park there. It's permitted there! There's a little cat... This man tried to help me... Sorry, that's life. -I'd chew you up, sweetie. -I'd get stuck in your throat! A man came with a box. What could he do with a box? He began calling the cat. On the phone, you said you'd send a skilled person. I thought you'd send a crane. A crane? A bulldozer. You're in the wrong place. You're wasting your time. -This is the SPCA, no? -That's right. And if we had removed it from the sewer, we would put it to sleep. Put it to sleep? "Sleep." Kill it. Do you know how many we put to sleep every day? You do what? You kill them? Can you repeat that, please? Where's my tape recorder? I'm a journalist. I don't like to use this, but... -Give me your details, please. -Relax, I'll give them to you. You can photograph and record. Do you have children? No. What does it have to do with this? -You see? -What? You have time for nonsense. So why are you called the SPCA? It's just a butcher shop. You thought I'd gone away? Schnitzer is furious. If the two articles don't get sent in by 5 p.m., you can forget about your job. We're flying to Bohnar now. Schnitzer wants us to cut her into little pieces. I must go by my house. No, it's gone far enough. -But it's on our way. -No, absolutely not! You're kind to animals, but who cares about people, huh? I'm sorry. I told them you weren't to blame. Hey. -What's this? -What's this? They didn't want it. That's what this is. -Amnon didn't want his things? -Their place has got everything. We're done. Should we move it upstairs or not? No. Where's our money? I don't have any money. The ATM swallowed my card. Swallowed or not, you're lucky you weren't swallowed up. I'll be back in an hour and I want my money. Do-gooder, you disgust me! You're lucky you're a woman, or I'd tear you apart! Destroyers of the country! Zofit, we must photograph her in the tub. Today's the deadline. I know. Leave me alone. You'll be fired, don't you get it? I need to talk to Amnon. And after that, you're coming with me. After that, he'll help me save the cat. -Forget about him already! -We're still married. I meant the cat. -Stop for a moment! -Why? Because Yakki says so, okay? Your Amnon is exactly as Michal said, a mental case. -He never did me any harm. -Yes, he only left you. Excuse me? I left him. Okay. That's it. I said my piece. Do what you want. I'll manage on my own! Hello, I'm a reporter and I'm reporting a health hazard. -What's the complaint? -It's not exactly that. There's a kitten stuck in the sewer drain. Sewer? You know, the metal grille. And I want... -Sewer, you said? -Does it matter? If it's a sewer, you must go to the sewer department. -This is sanitation. -I was told to go to the water department. I went to the water department, they sent me to the inspection department, and they sent me to the sanitation department, so now I'm here. I'm a resident of this city. You should hear it meow. I would do it myself, but I can't. I need help. What's the problem? After work, your husband and some of his friends can lift it up. My husband is dead. Message for Amnon from Zofit. I know everything. It's not important. You're the only one that can help me. I'll wait outside my house. It's a matter of life and death. I've been watching your things. Thanks. But I don't care about them anymore. -Do you have a phone token? -No. Do you want to come up to my place and call? Yes. I don't know where I put my glasses. You only use them when you write on the tape writer. -Typewriter. -Typewriter. Imagine writing poetry on the tape recorder. You broke up? More or less. You don't want his stuff and he doesn't either? More or less. It's all "more or less." Isn't anything exact? How old are you? Seventeen, more or less. And you? How old do I look? You look great. I get it. You're trying to hit on me. I don't believe it. The editorial desk won't pick up. Do you know you're charming? That's not true. Yes, it is. -What's your name? -Eyal. I thought it was a matter of life and death. It is. It's going to rain. He'll drown. You wanted this separation as much as I did. You can't just pester me. You're talking like a stranger. Nice to meet you. Miriam Bohnar. Nice to meet you. Amnon. May I sit nearby and listen? Yes. It's fine. I'll be done soon. I got a big fine because of her. She didn't want to wear the helmet. What a shitty day. You are a plague. Bless you. -Good bye, darling! -See you soon, honey. Do you want me to come back home? Why are you doing this to me? You can't manage without me. Yes, I can. Fact is, I'm here. You have connections in the municipality. Use them. So, you want me to speak to Elinoar's father? You're not that naive. Why is it when I ask you to do something, we quarrel? Her father is in the city council. Only he can help. I'm sure Elinoar will agree to help. Let me ask her. The way you're trying to split us up stinks. Stinks? Stinks?! You taking the phone line stinks. I bet you have two. He has two lines. This is my shirt, and I don't want that tart touching it! -I supported you for four years. -You cheated on me for four years. What were you doing in NY while I wrote poetry? I raised you, you baby. You never worked at all. I did. I'm a poet. To me, that's work. Grandpa. You're beautiful. Compared to what? This is your last chance to decide. Do you want me back? What's so "last chance" about it? Elinoar is pregnant. -Not from you. -Why not? Because your sperm is no good. Seems like it is. I want you to decide. I've decided. I want both of you to get out of here. Hello? Police? I want to report a bomb on 17 Netsah Israel Str. In the sewer. I came to inform you that I can't be interviewed. I also didn't agree to be photographed in the tub. Is it because I was late? On the contrary, I'm happy you were late. Suddenly, I understood I shouldn't be interviewed. My theater must speak for itself. It can't be explained to those who don't comprehend. That's why I was never interviewed, not even in France. I'm afraid they'll steal my fire. So, why did you come? Curiosity. I love a mess. Don't let me bother you. Keep on doing what you must. I'm part of this chair, this street, this state. I'm glad you don't want to be interviewed. They hate you at the paper and wanted us to write vicious things about you. Interesting. I completely understand that. There is something against Israelis not living here. I'm not angry. I'm full of love, like a dying person. You shouldn't talk that way. You're not old. But I'm sick. You look healthy. Yes. A woman has to look her best on the outside. She needs to wear makeup and dress well. Then she is to be left alone, and that's good. You must learn to be on your own. Why did you call the police? I want them to break open the sewer. The most important thing is concentration. You really lack it. You see that one in blue? She said there is a bomb there. Eyal! A message from Schnitzer. You're fired. A message from Schnitzer. You're fired. It's for the best. You'll find a more suitable job. I see you need to be by yourself. I'm going. What else can I do to save it? The solution is not with other people. I think you finally understand it. Right? Concentration. Concentrate for once in your life. Where's the money? A new excuse? -She won't bring the money. -She will. Sorry, I don't have it. Take all the stuff there. It must be worth more than what I owe you. -You have nerve. We want our money. -This guy says you reported a bomb. There isn't any bomb, only a meowing cat. Do you know anything about this? They booted him because of me, so he's angry at me. Liar. -You put that barrel there? -Yes. -Did you try getting the cat out? -Yes. -Your ID, please. -This crazy chick has been here for hours. ID, please. All this mess here is her fault. You're walking around without an ID? I think I put it in the wardrobe. -A con artist. -No, a lunatic. They're the most dangerous. Look, we're alone. Do you want to come home with me? THIRD STORY "Divorce" You're making a mistake. I'm doing my job. I'm a friend of Israel Roshko. You can be a friend of the Police Chief for all I care. Are you always this tough? Tikva, what about the sandwich? It's on its way. Can I have a bite? Why not? It took you a long time. I'm starving. I wrote a ticket for someone who claimed he knew Roshko. -You're a lost cause. -Why? I told you there are rules. No wonder I'm in an air-conditioned office and you're drying up on some hot street corner. To me, there are no rules, only laws. -Want a pepper? -You're so stubborn. Sixty-nine for half an hour. What kind of country is it? What's wrong with 69 for half an hour? You know what 69 is. Okay. I didn't say anything. What 69? Look at the guy in the suit. He must be a foreigner. Don't you like your French fries? Tikva. Tikva! Menashe! What happened? Menashe! -A thief? -Yes, a thief! -What did he steal? -Menashe. What? I don't understand. Does anyone here speak German? Stop this charade or I'll arrest you. -Charade? Is he a thief? -Not a thief. A murderer! What? Who did he murder? He murdered me. He ruined my life. Look at me. I will never forget your shitty face. What's wrong with you? It's him. It's Menashe. Does anyone here understand German? What's going on? -I understand German. -Good. What does she want from me? -He wants to know what you want from him. -What I want from him?! -Stop this act, Menashe! -Stop this act, Menashe. Who is Menashe? What is Menashe? I am Arp Ziskin. Who is Menashe? What's Menashe? He is Arp Ziskin. Here, Arp Ziskin. It's a German passport. He's hurrying to the airport. Can he go? Thanks. It is him. Stay out of it. It's personal. Policewoman out of control in Shalom Tower basement. Menashe! Hello, mister! Hey! Lady cop, he didn't buy a ticket. Sorry, honey. The establishment of a Jewish state in Eretz-Israel. To be known as the state of Israel. You can come out, Menashe. Anybody speaks German? 33 over. Aviv here. What's going on? I told you to stay out of it. -Roshko says you must stop this. -It has nothing to do with work. You're in uniform. This is a serious act. Give me the gun. This is the policewoman who hugged Ofra Haza. -Is the gun real? -Yeah. Get out of here! -Roshko orders you to stop immediately. -I've waited for this for five years. If you don't understand, you're nothing to me. Tikva, it's not him. What? Roshko tells you what to do? Why don't you talk to me? Weren't five years of silence enough? Look me in the eyes, Menashe. I know it's you. I have too many questions and I don't speak German. Talk! You know how beautiful your daughter is? Do you know Erez is already in first grade? When asked if he has a father, he says his father is dead. If you remain silent, it will be true. I've waited for this for five years. Where were you those five years? You ruined my life. You agreed to divorce two days before you disappeared. You promised. So why? Tell me why or I'll shoot you. You think it's funny? Believe me, Menashe, I'm not afraid of you anymore. Go on. Kill me if you can. Tikva, give me the gun. Roshko says you must go straight to questioning. If he leaves this country, I'm doomed for life. What? He's leaving the country. What will I do? You'll have time to think about that in jail. Tikva, are you crazy? Put the gun down. That's an order! Beware of me because I am crazy! Tell Rohsko I'll trade Pazit only for Menashe. He's on his way to the airport with a German passport. He calls himself Arp Ziskin. Put on the handcuffs. What are you waiting for? Put on the handcuffs! You stay here. -To all units, second call. -Stop. A cop is in distress in the wax museum. Hurry. You can continue. Do you speak Hebrew? Yes, why? So why do you speak Yiddish? It's so annoying. This is his honor, Rabbi Laufer. Shame on you, lady. Attention all units. This is Iris 33. The kidnapper is in the elevator headed to the observatory. Stop the elevator. The kidnapper is a cop with police radio. So don't use it. I repeat. Get off the radio. Rabbi Laufer, come with us. The rest, stay here. -But why? -Because I'm asking nicely. Sir, please leave. Please get out. Sit. -We were only hugging. -You can leave. You stay here. -But we were only hugging. -Get up! Gili. -Get out. -But why? -Run! -But, Gili! But we didn't do anything. I want to stay with him. Tikva, Roshko here. I know you were angry, but now, you must be sorry. Explain what you want and we'll help you out of this. Where is Menashe? Arp Ziskin? Not located. He hasn't reached the airport yet. What do you want from him? A divorce. Please repeat. I want a divorce from Menashe! It's not funny. I know you, you're an excellent cop. You may feel unappreciated, but it's not true. If you give up now, we'll forget about it. If you give up now, he'll be considerate. I don't want to give up. I want a divorce! Watch out! If someone tries to be a hero, he'll get shot. Don't do anything stupid. Has he placed snipers yet? Quick. Put your handcuffs on the floor and leave! Stop it, Tikva. Do you think you're Rambo? Watch it. Move. Come in front of me. Move. Didn't you hear what I said? Put your handcuffs on the floor and leave! Didn't I ask you already? I can't leave him. Please. She told you to go out, okay? So beat it! Sorry. Lock the handcuffs. Watch it. Give me your hand, okay? Is it too tight? You don't speak to women. I don't speak to lunatics. Are you always so tough? So original. Everyone I give tickets to asks me that. What is your answer? I keep writing the ticket like I didn't hear them. What's your name? Menashe. Menashe? -What's your surname? -Prosper. -You're Prosper to me. -Whatever you say. My name is Tikva. Do you know why? -No. -Me neither. Erez. Mally wanted to talk-- What? Robin Hood? What about Robin Hood? I know I promised. I'm stuck with another shift. We'll go tomorrow, okay? What? Erez? Erez? Mally? Tell him not to cry. Make yourselves scrambled eggs and a salad, okay? Okay, honey. I'll call later, okay? You'll pay for this. Jail with the hookers. And for what? It isn't even Menashe. -Who are you to tell me it isn't Menashe? -I'm your commanding officer. Yeah, both of us know why. So, what if you're still married? Nobody will marry you anyway. You're a bimbo in a cop's uniform. Having sex for business interests. Excuse me, Rabbi. She's married too. Better than being all dried up inside. Sleeping with the commander while arresting hookers. Why not? -Liar! Ugly bitch! -You better watch it. I don't care if I die today. And you pretended to be my friend? Tikva, it's Roshko. What's going on? Everybody's okay, commander. Have you located Menashe? Arp Ziskin hasn't arrived at the airport yet. Arp Ziskin. Roshko, I won't release anyone until I get a divorce from Menashe. Menashe. Put me in prison. Either way, I'm serving a life sentence. It's all your fault. You and your ancient laws. Rohsko's planning something. I know him. Snake. I must reach the observatory. Let's go. -Where? -To the observatory. It's safest. Why am I explaining this? Come on. Rabbi. Hey. Hey. -Can I stay with Gili? Please. -You know you're a pest? I won't be a bother. Please. You've got a lot to learn about men. Come on. But no hugging, it's annoying. Jack and Jill. -Your name? -Shirli. -Shirli, help them with their masks. -Why? Because I know Roshko. I have a request. -I thought you don't speak to lunatics. -I must make a call. Later, Rabbi. Put your masks on. Roshko, I'm taking the elevator to the top. I need a clear area in the hallway and the observatory. Did you hear? I hear you. It'll be clear. No problem. No problem? I hope you'll have a problem, snake. Tear gas! You disqualified me from officers training for breaking under stress, remember, Roshko? I'm performing pretty well, don't you think? Did you like the fireworks? It's for my independence day. Breaking under stress. You were my stress. You disappoint me. I thought you were more rational than this. Rational? So, how could you think I would sleep with you? -Sorry. -Why didn't you tell me? I need to make a call. It's a police radio, not a phone. Don't move! The Rabbi needs to make an urgent call, sorry. Civil Defense exercise. Be calm. It's only a drill. But the elevator is stuck. Watch it! Move, come on. Yes, she means business. Yes. Tell the guys to check what the police is cooking up. We're already in the picture. Very good. Tell Mandelmann to tell the Minister to tell the police to stop fooling around. They're endangering lives. Oh, no. -I must reach the top. It's safest there. -It's ten more flights. He won't make it. -What do you say? -Sorry. -What do you say? -Shirli's hungry. Tikva, not everyone is in your physical condition. -Tikva. -What? -Maybe the service elevator is working. -Gili has to pee. Actually, so do I. -Prosper. -Tikva. -Prosper. -Tikva. -Prosper. -Tikva. I'm shy. What can I do? -They've got Menashe. -Who? How do you know? Connections. Roshko, I heard they've got Menashe. -How do you know? -Connections. It's working. Menashe is on his way here. His passport is fake. -Why didn't you tell us he's a fugitive? -Because I didn't know. Tikva, we heard gunshots. What's going on? I fired accidentally. Some are injured. I'm coming down. Sorry, Roshko. I didn't mean to kill anyone. What? Repeat? Rabbi Laufer is severely injured. I didn't mean to kill Pazit. What's that? Let the pig weep over you. -How can you sleep with him? -He's a great lay. -But he's disgusting. -You'd be surprised. Tikva, do you hear me? Answer me. Where are you? One more flight up. Up? God is up. I can't move. I can help him. Tikva, where are you? What's the condition of the injured people? Sorry, Rabbi. I'm not enjoying this. I didn't intend for anyone to get hurt. Please understand. I have no hope. I've been alone for five years. Sleeping alone, raising the kids alone. Five years without a man. I'm conservative. What can I do? If a guy hits on me, I refuse. For what? If he's not serious, he's not for me. If he is, what can he find with me? A trap? I'm only 32. I don't want to die alone. I understand your pain. Judaism does all it can to release a woman from the state of desertion without divorce. If a man refuses to divorce his wife, it's forced upon him until he agrees. However, he must release his wife. It's absurd. You say she's crazy? Your laws are crazier. Marriage is sacred. And divorce is dirty? Are you married? I was. What a shitty set-up. One morning, I wake up, and the guy is gone. He exists, yet he doesn't. He's not alive, yet he's not dead. The law can't help me, you can't help me. Everyone knows I'm right, but being right doesn't help. A wife buys her freedom in one of two ways. Divorce or death of her husband. This is God's will. Even he can't help me. Relax, don't be tragic. Jack and Jill. Go home. -Thank you for letting me stay with him. -Yes. I thank you too. -I'm sorry. -It's okay. Life is full of experiences. Good luck. Good luck to you too. Wait. I want you to take something with you. If something happens to me, give this to my kids. Prosper, help the Rabbi. Tikva, we have a problem. I hope you hear me. Your husband escaped. We're looking for him. It will take some time. Can you answer me? Roshko, I don't buy your tricks. Try something else. You thought you could fool me, eh? Throw your weapon. You have no chance. On the count of three, drop your weapons. One... two... Good, Tikva. Now the gun. Slowly. What do you do?! Tikva, watch out! Don't shoot! Do you want all of us to blow up, Roshko? I'll count to three. Do you think it's a toy? Try me. I've got nothing to lose. You'll endanger everyone. -Shut up! -One! Tikva, you're making a mistake. Menashe escaped. I don't know-- Two! You're a murderer! Enough, Roshko! Don't you see she's serious? Thanks. Why are you helping me? Good question. How about a good answer? I don't have such a good answer for you. I'm helping you because I don't think you stand a chance. Do you feel sorry for me? No. I think married or divorced, it's all in your head. The most important thing is what's in here. If you and I would, you know... Just as an example. Do you think I'd care if you were married? I'd live with you anyway, without marriage. What's a divorce? It's a piece of paper. -It's true. -What's true? Menashe really escaped, but don't give up. It'll be okay. Tikva, we have a rabbinical delegation here, friends of Rabbi Laufer. -They want to talk to you. -Go on, you won't regret it. Let them come up. And your kids are here to ask you to come down. Mommy. Yes, darling? I love you and I'm proud of you. Keep on... Mommy, it's Erez. Tomorrow, we're going to Robin Hood, right? You promised me. I hope so, darling. Tikva. I promised them to go see Robin Hood. I always keep my promises. -They'll never forgive me. -Of course they will. How could I do this to them? Did you think I could kill you? I can't even kill myself. Well, can you rely on the police? All is settled. He will give you a divorce and we will send him to Germany. The police doesn't know anything and we won't tell. Your husband, free of will, agrees to give you a divorce in the presence of the rabbinical court. Tomorrow, he will fly to Germany and you'll be free. I see you're shocked. Good. Is that true, Menashe? Yes. I want to know why. I'm giving you the divorce, so why does it matter? No. I mean why you disappeared. Why did I deserve it? I don't know. No. No what? I don't agree. I'm supposed to agree... so I don't. But that's what you wanted, a divorce. Yes, but not this way. Why does it matter how? You're buying your freedom. Do you think if he gives it to me now, I'd feel free? I thought so too. But I don't. Everything is kosher. Kosher, but stinks. I want him to pay for what he's done. He must go to jail. Tikva, I'm the father of your children. Who is this man? I don't know him. Roshko, I'm done. You can come up. Arp Ziskin is also waiting for you here. Tikva, look. For Tikva Jack and Jill
