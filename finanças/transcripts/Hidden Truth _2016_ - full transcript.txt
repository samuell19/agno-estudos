Hey, Zoe, you ready? Hey, Zoe, you ready to go? Hey! Gotta get going. Hi. You ready to go? Okay. Just one second. I didn't even start wearing makeup until I was in my 20s. Times have changed, Aunt Jamie, times have changed. Yes, they have. Trust me though, you don't want to grow up quite as fast as you think you do. Oh, but I do. You look just like your mom. That's what I keep hearing. Zoe, come on, I'm leaving. Okay, you coming in? - No, thanks, I'm good. - Okay. Wait for me here, okay? - Hey, Jamie. - Hey! - Hi! - Morning! That is a good choice. Hey, Michael. I mean, I used to be in the music industry. It is my niece's birthday and I want to get her something. Oh! You know what? Let me see that. Well, you know what? Oh, yeah. She's going to like this one much better. - Yeah? - Yup. - Okay. - Thanks. - Yup. - Nice to see you. - You, too. - Say hi to Veronique. - I will. - Okay. Bye. Hi, you've reached Zoe's voice-mail, leave a message. Zoe, where did you go? I told you to wait for me. Can you call me, please? Hey! Hey, sis. Zoe took off again. Yeah, she tends to do that. She's your daughter. Why am I the one trying so hard? I know you are, and I'm grateful for everything you're doing. You checked by the park by the east side of the lake? No. I found her there a couple of times after Layla died hanging out with her friends. All right, I'll check there. - It's her birthday tomorrow. - I know it is. I haven't forgotten. Well, I'm having a birthday party for her at the house. So maybe you want to come. She thinks I abandoned her. She hates me. Her mother hated me. Pace, please stop playing the victim. You asked me to look after her. You needed to get your drinking under control after Layla died. Yeah, well, the whole town thinks I killed my wife. I still get dirty looks everywhere I go. I got nothing here, Jamie. You got everything. Oh, yeah. A marriage that fell apart after a year. Yeah, how's that house you got out of it? Yeah, well, that house is why I'm able to look after Zoe. Will you please just come tomorrow? It would mean a lot to her, whether she shows it or not, and you... gotta start getting out of here. You can't hide like this all the time. Yeah, I'll think about it. Thank you. I said I'll think about it. Good. Thank you. - Okay, all right. I'll try. - Okay. Bring a present, please. - See you! - Yeah, see you. I got you something. I didn't get you anything on your birthday. So? What is it? Well, open it and find out. I only had enough money to buy you one charm, but you can always get more. Let me do it. It's for luck. I need all the luck I can get to get out of this town. It's nice. Thanks. Happy birthday. There's a whole world waiting out there for us, Natalie. Mmm. I like it here. It's easy. Maybe for you. Right. Sorry. I know it's been rough for you. I'd do anything to get out of here. I've almost got enough money saved. Saved? From what? You don't have a job. I've got a sponsor. That sounds potentially gross. Nothing is as gross as the thought of me spending the rest of my life here. Trust me. It's kind of cool of Jamie to throw you a party. Can't wait. Oh, come on. It might be fun! All right, well, you can go and stand in for me. She's just trying to do something nice for you. Yeah, I guess. Speak of the devil. You couldn't have told me? I texted you! Yes, you did. I'm just going to hang out with Natalie, okay? Well, okay, but you don't want to have lunch? I was going to buy it for you. I'm dieting. Can I please just stay here and hang out with Natalie? Please? Okay, I'll see you at home for dinner at 7:00? - Yeah, sure. - 7:00! Bye, Natalie. How annoying! Oh, she's fine. How's my little bird? Ew! I'm not your little bird. Ah, you know you are. Right? You've been avoiding me. It's my Aunt Jamie. She suspects something. No, she doesn't. You don't know her. She's all over me with questions. I do know her. But I'm not stupid. She has no clue what's going on here. None at all. Well, that's not very nice. After all I do for you. I'm only doing this long enough to have enough money to move to LA, and then I never have to see you or this place again. Ow! You're hurting me! Let go! Quit it! You're hurting me! Jeez. You know, I want to see you tomorrow. I can't. It's my birthday. You will, and I'll make it worth your while. You want the rest of your money, so you can get out of this place once and for all. Same place, same time as usual. Get out. Zoe, what happened? I thought you're meeting me for dinner. I'm really tired. You can lecture me in the morning. Get back here! I'm not lecturing you. I'm your guardian. You're going to have to start following some of my rules. - This wasn't my idea. - No, it wasn't mine either, but your dad is my brother. - Who didn't want me anymore. - No! Who loves you very much, and so do I. And both of us want what's best for you, and he couldn't do that for you after your mom died. She was murdered. Zoe... I know that! Yeah. And the whole town, my school... the Sheriff thought... No, wait... Still thinks he killed her. Yeah, and that's exactly why we stand behind him. Right! The way you stood behind me, when he handed me off to you. Hey! Are we going to keep going in circles like this? That's all they do here! They just go in circles, never going anywhere. I want out of this stupid town! I want out from the staring eyes and I want away from my drunk father. He's been sober for months! Yeah, and you weren't around when he wasn't, so don't try to step in now and save the day. I don't need you! I can take care of myself! Aunt Jamie. Hey. I'm sorry. Honey. No, I'm sorry. Hey. How's the marina project coming along? Okay. It'll be better once the town approves things. You're awfully tense. Just been working too hard, I guess. Well, you know what they say about all work and no play. Um, don't we have a tour group coming in today? - Yes. - Yeah. I will be more in the mood once the town approves my plans. - Okay? - Okay. Okay. Happy birthday. Zoe! Zoe! Hey, birthday girl. Zoe? Hello! Zoe, it's your dad. Just wanted to wish you a happy birthday. I'm hoping we can talk at your party. I love you. See you tonight. Thanks. Hi, you've reached Zoe's voice-mail. Leave a message. This was the last time. Is it? You said you were going to give me the rest of the money. Mmm. Did I? Yeah, you did. And if you don't... You'll what? I'm only 16... well, 17. You could go to jail. All I'd have to do is say the word. Are you... Are you threatening me, huh? No, I'm bargaining. Just like you always do. You hear me? I'm done with you! Now back off! I can take these. Thank you. This is my fault. I left her a message saying I was going to come to her party. No, that's the right thing to do. Was it? Now, sweetheart, you don't call the shots. I'll call the cops! They'll take you away! I'll tell your wife! I'll tell everyone about you and my mother! Give me that! Hey, Zoe! Zoe, will you please just call us and let us know you're okay? I won't ask any other questions. I'm just worried. Mrs. Nevin, everything's all cleaned up, and my dad should be here soon to pick me up. Aw, thank you, Natalie. I'm sure Zoe just forgot about the party. Yeah. Yeah, that's probably what happened. - I'll see you - Bye. Zoe! Zoe! Zoe? Zoe! Zoe! Zoe! Zoe! Where are you? Zoe? Zoe! Zoe! Oh, my... Are you looking for this? Have you considered that your niece may have run away again? She's just never been gone this long before, and we've been getting along better recently. But there was trouble at home? Yeah, but nothing serious. I mean, you know the situation. - But... - Okay. We're checking the bus and the train lines, and we sent a report to the LAPD, in case she's headed there. You call me, if you need anything. My cell's on there, in case I'm not in the office. - Okay. - Thanks, Mrs. Nevin. Okay, thank you. Pace Nevin's kid. No telling where she's gone. Michael. Michael. Oh, my God, they just found Zoe Nevin's body in the lake. They think it's murder. Michael, did you hear me? Oh, my God. First her mother, then her. Jamie. Hey. - Sorry, I'm late. - No, I'm glad you came. How you doing, sis? What about you? How you doing? I've had my moments. Any news? No, the Sheriff's not saying anything. Nobody else is saying anything. Yes, it's just a matter of time. What? What do you mean? I've already heard the rumors. Pace, no. That's not going to happen again. Hey, Natalie. Hey, Mrs. Nevin. I'm so sorry. You think you know people, but you really don't. What do you mean? People are like prisms. Lots of sides. Take Pace Nevin. Seems like a good guy. Has a business. But he has a dark side. He beat and killed his wife, and I'm betting he did the same to his kid. You still believe that, huh, boss? Oh, Nevin has a side to him you don't want to see. You trust me on that. I've known him since he was a kid. Lots of issues, problems. His sister is the only good Nevin seed. What? That's just Michael Evans. Yes. What's he doing here? He's probably paying his respects. There you are. Sheriff Connell's here. He asked to talk to you about Zoe Nevin. Okay. Tell him I'll be there in a second. Sheriff. A surprise visit? Michael. Just investigating Zoe Nevin's death. Very sad, very sad. Can't say I knew her. She worked for you apparently, last summer? Her mother worked for you, too. Sure. Ah, right. Right. I remember her. She quit before the season was up. So you do know her. Yeah, sorry, we have so many people come and go from working here, don't we, honey? I understand. We haven't actually seen her around since she worked here. But you went to the memorial service yesterday at the lake. I was... Yeah, I was just driving by. I saw people at the lake. Was curious. You know, had to look. Didn't actually go to the service. - Got it. - Oh, yeah. Yeah, well, we're just asking everyone to be diligent here with this because it's just been a year and a bit since her mother was also killed. So horrible. A mother and her daughter. Of course, Sheriff Connell. Is there anything... anything else we can do for you today? No, that's it for today. Thanks for the coffee, Mrs. Evans. Anytime. What happened there? Oh! Oh, yeah, yeah. I cut me head on a... nail in the storage room. Nasty wound, huh? That's a big nail. Yes, it was. You gotta be careful these days. That's what my wife says. You have a good one now. You, too, Sheriff. I found a $1,000 in her room, and she didn't have a job. So, someone gave it to her. Maybe she had a job you didn't know about. Maybe she just saved it up. I just don't think that's possible. With all due respect, Miss Nevin, a lot of real parents don't know a whole lot about what their kids do. Okay, I might not be her "real parent," but she was like a daughter to me. Okay then. So what about physical evidence? The body was in the water for two days. What DNA and physical evidence there was is long gone. There was a white nylon line, the kind you use to tie up boats wrapped around both legs and arms. He could have tied it to an object to weigh her body down and somehow it came off. Cell phone? We haven't found it. It's probably at the bottom of the lake. But we have been over her calls, there's nothing unusual. Friends at school, your number. Text messages? Phone company doesn't keep a record of text messages. They're stored on the phone. I do have the autopsy report, if you want to hear about it. Yeah. Are you sure? Water in her lungs, but the coroner believes she was dead before she was placed in the water. By the bruises and contusions on her skull, he believes the likely cause of death was blunt-force trauma. Um... and was she... No, no. There was no physical evidence to suggest that your niece was raped, but she was sexually active, possibly just before death. This homicide... is a crime of passion by someone who was very angry. What does that mean? I mean, what are you getting at? I believe it was someone she knew. Someone with a history, a bad temper. Sheriff! My brother did not kill his daughter. Pace. Yeah, Connell? Just wanted to talk about the last time you saw your daughter. When was that? About a month ago, I guess. You guess? Could you be more specific? I may randomly seen her around town, but if that happens I try and stay out of sight. And she lives with your sister and not you. Why? Well, come on now, Sheriff. The whole town knows that story. The time you hit her, she called us. And then she wouldn't cooperate with the charge. Did you have something to do with that? No, I wasn't even there. Went back to the Roadhouse, got more drunk. Sheriff, I haven't had a drink in six months. I'm trying. So let's just get down to it and tell me why you're really here. I told your sister I believe you killed your wife Layla. Oh, well, that ain't no newsflash. You had nothing on me. I also think you may have killed your daughter the same way. Now unless you have something to charge me with, we're done here. I may not at this moment, Pace, but you'll mess up and I will be there. I've done my messing up in life. You're looking at the wrong guy. - I love my daughter. - And your wife? No, I didn't love my wife. I sure as hell didn't kill her. I got work to do here, gentlemen. You have a nice day. So you told me that you saw Zoe the day of her birthday party. What did she say to you? She wanted me to leave her alone. Let her think. Had something on her mind I guess. Do you know what it would have been? Natalie, if you know something, it's important that you tell me. I promised her I wouldn't say. Honey, she's gone. Everything's changed. And you can tell me. She said she'd been saving money, that she had this sponsor. An adult? She didn't say, but I assume. None of us have jobs or any money saved up. So it must have been an adult. Hey, I just wanted to say how sorry I am for your loss. Thank you. She was a friend, I imagine. She was my best friend. I am truly sorry for both of your losses. Please have lunch on the house. Anything on the menu. On me. It's my pleasure. Thank you, Michael. It's my pleasure. That's a lot of money for someone her age. I mean, whoever was giving it to her was... not paying her for babysitting. Who do you think it was? I don't know. I thought you might. I don't know a thing about her for the last few years. Sheriff Connell stopped by. Like I said, it was just a matter of time. No, it's not. He tried this last time and he couldn't prove a thing. Well, it's a small town, sis. He could if he really wanted to. So now what? Do you believe him? Jimmy would lie to a priest for a beer. For a six pack, he'll tell you anything you want to hear. Pace he was in there all night. There must be other witnesses. Oh, there are. And all back his alibi, same as last time. But he's sober now. What's he doing in there all night? He says he's shooting pool and drinking non-alcoholic beer. All right, so now what? Pace Nevin's no dummy. He didn't leave a single piece of evidence before when he killed his wife. Let's hope he wasn't as careful this time. I've always been afraid to ask you what happened that night with you and Layla. We were over at Jimmy's Roadhouse getting drunk. She wanted to stay for one last round, I told her she had enough, she wasn't having it. She started rubbing up on some guy. I left, went home. Leave me alone, Pace. - Layla. - I'm not coming home! Layla, I'm coming to get you. That's it. Pace, go to sleep. - I'm trying to have some fun. - Layla! I passed out. I woke up the next morning, she was gone. Where do you think she went? Beats me. Sheriff Connell thinks I killed her and dragged her body into the lake because she was publicly embarrassing me. What about the person she was with at the bar? Never seen again. That wasn't the first time. She had plenty of men around town. If you leave this car, I swear to you... Don't touch me, Michael. Hey! Hey! No! Michael! Who actually did it, I don't know. Betting that I knew her so well, she probably threatened one of her men. She liked to go after the married type. But I didn't touch her. Not that night at least. I think it was the same person. What do you mean? I mean the murders are so similar. I don't think it's a coincidence. I think the person who killed Layla killed Zoe. I gave it to Zoe for her birthday. You're sure? It was attached to a bracelet, but yeah. And this was the day before her birthday? Yeah. She put it on right away. Okay, thanks. I think Zoe left this when she moved in with you. She took the rest. You found this in a row boat? Yeah. Needle in a haystack. How long did Zoe work at the Pines? For half a summer. Before she moved in with you, she quit. Wasn't her thing. Didn't Layla work there? Yeah. What did Layla think of the Evans? She didn't really say. Although I had to pick her up a few times at the Roadhouse, and Michael was there, just about as drunk as she was. Oh, and his wife? Never really saw her. Maybe at the lodge bar, but never outside of there. Hmm. The Evans are pretty well-to-do for these parts. Don't you think? Yeah, you can definitely say that. Excuse me, Veronique. Hi, Jamie. We're not actually open yet. I know. I just wanted... to stop in and see if Michael was around so I could ask him some questions about when Zoe worked here. Um... Hi, Jamie. Jamie wanted to ask about when Zoe worked here. Oh. I actually have some work to do. - Goodbye, Jamie. - Thank you. I'm as sorry about what happened to her as anybody. Maybe I can help? Well, I was hoping you could tell me what she was like as an employee and if you remember why she quit. Well, Zoe wasn't meant to be a waitress... You know, kept getting the orders wrong. I offered to let her work in the kitchen, but she refused, so she... she quit, - but... no hard feelings. - Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm. So you never saw her after that? From time to time around town... in passing, yeah. - Why? - Um... You weren't giving her money for any reason, were you? Pardon? She had a lot for someone her age, and I'm trying to figure out where it came from. It didn't come from me, if that's what you came to ask. Okay. And I don't like your implication. No, I am sorry. That's it. That is it. I have a business to open. Please let yourself out. Miss Nevin, please come in. Sit. Thank you. Um... So I believe... that Zoe was killed on the opposite side of the lake, and she was put in a boat and she was dropped in the middle of the lake. And you can prove this, how? I found a charm from a bracelet she was wearing in one of the rowboats on the opposite side of the lake from where she was found. So, Sheriff, I want to ask you... what is the motive for my brother to kill his own daughter. Miss Nevin... what if Zoe knew something that could implicate her father in his wife's murder. I mean, we all know the story that Zoe saw her mother getting in a vehicle, which is hardly convincing. Zoe, you need to be absolutely certain what you saw last night. My mom got into a car. Whose vehicle? Did you see it? It was dark. - It was out on Main Street? - Just down from the lodge. Could it have been your father's vehicle? Is it possible she got in with him? No. How could you be sure? Did you see him the rest of the night? No... I don't know. I didn't go home that night. So he could've gone out, found her drunk on the street. Maybe. I don't know. But it is probable that she was covering for her father and knew more than what she was saying. Or she was just a scared and confused 15-year-old. Since we can't ask Zoe. Maybe this is speculation, but if it's not... it means your brother had plenty of motive. I just think you're wrong. You think we're wrong? This charm came from her bracelet, and the rest of that bracelet is still somewhere. This is the money I took out of her room. I'm sure you can get prints off of that, and then there's this. So I'm not the expert here, you guys are. But my gut is telling me that Michael Evans is connected to Zoe, I think as far back as Layla. Those are some serious allegations. I'm aware of that. Michael Evans is a very upstanding citizen in this town. Well, he's also one of the only ones who has this kind of money to throw around. Sheriff, I just want you to look into this. Please, will you do that? Please, for Zoe? Just look into it. Thank you for stopping by, Miss Nevin. Are you really this close-minded? I know as well as anyone that my brother has had troubles, but Sheriff, you've known me and you've known Pace since we were babies, and I'm telling you there is more to this, and I believe that you will know that if you just look into it. I got this from the Nevin's. It's an interesting photo. Wow! Uh, yeah. I don't even remember getting that picture taken. Have you told me everything about Zoe Nevin? Of course, I have. About that injury to your head? Okay, I told you. I hit it on a nail in the storage room. Okay, would you like to see? Yes, I would. Very well then. Right this way. Right there. Okay then. You get that checked out at the hospital by any chance? Uh, no, no. It's not that bad. Just cleaned it up myself. You should be careful. The nail is a little bit rusty. You don't want to get a tetanus shot. Those suckers hurt. I didn't even think of that. Thank you, maybe I should get it checked out. Yeah. Um, and I wish you luck in getting to the bottom of this. Mammoth Lakes really, really needs some closure. Is there anything else? Very well. Get this cup to the lab and analyzed for fingerprints and DNA. And tell them I want the results today. Copy that, boss. There was no Styrofoam cup in that boat when I was there. The cup tested positive for your brother's fingerprints and DNA. That puts him at the crime scene. I can't believe that. Maybe not, but it's enough for the state attorney to go forward with a manslaughter charge. We're booking Pace now. What? No! Did you look into the money I gave you? Did you look into the picture? Did you? Jamie, listen... Hey, Ed. - Hey. - Just gonna get this. I'm really sorry about what happened. - Thanks. - This town ain't the same anymore. You know that alley in the side of the building? I see a lot of things going on out there at night. Drug dealing. I've called the Sheriff so many times. Yeah, well, don't get me started on that. - Thanks. - Hey. I don't know if I should be telling you this, but I did see your niece in that alley. - When? - A few times. Yeah, but when was the last time you saw her? Maybe a week ago. Was she by herself? She was by herself. A car pulls up, she got in it. Okay, what did the car look like? It was dark color, it's all I know. And it was a car, or was it an SUV or... It could've been an SUV. You didn't get a look at the driver, did you? Sorry. Thanks. - Ed? - Back so soon? Yeah, where do you keep your surveillance footage? In the office. Can I take a look at it? Yeah, come on back. Okay, anytime after 4:00 p.m. should be good. Pause it there. Can I get this printed? Yeah. Anytime, Bill. You have a good one now. Sheriff Connell. Your office said I could find you here. So whoever owns this car picked up Zoe that day. I'll have it looked into. It was very hard to tell if what you're seeing is actually what you're thinking. This is getting ridiculous. It's insane. You have a man in jail for something he didn't do. I'm bringing you evidence. I'm giving it to you, you're not doing anything with it. Miss Nevin, you have to let me do my job. I don't see you doing your job! Yeah, I use that alley once in a while, and... sure, yeah, it could be my car. This is from the day before the Nevin kid was killed. Did you use it then? No. You didn't ever see or meet Zoe Nevin in the alley? No. I hardly knew her. I already told you that, Sheriff Connell. I mean, why this questioning? You know... I would never hurt a kid. I know. This case is, well... It's complicated, to say the least. Okay, fine. If there's anything I can do for you. Anything. Please let me know. Okay? But, Michael, I do need to ask you a question. Just so I can clear things up. Hmm? That afternoon, and evening... October 14th, Friday, where were you? I was here, of course. Do you... Do you want me to prove it? Honey, on that day the girl was murdered, I was here the whole day, right? Yeah. Yes. Yes, he was. Well, that's all I need to hear. - Okay. - Miss Evans. - What's all this about? - Nothing. - Hi. - Hi, can I help you? Yeah, I'm wondering if you can tell me if you've granted any land leases to anyone on this side of the lake? Hold on, let me check. Ah, here it is. The land lease belongs to a Michael Evans. He lives here in town. Can I get a copy of this? - Sure. - Okay. Hi. Hi. Are you the boy who found the body on the lake the other day? I saw you on the news. Yeah, was that your kid? Yeah. That was my niece. So do you live around here? Yeah, I live by the lake over there. Okay, do you remember if a few days before you found the body, you saw or heard anything unusual? Like what? Like a struggle or two people fighting or anything like that? Look, I gotta go, okay. I hope you find the guy who did it. Hang on. Hang on! Hang on, wait. As we told you before the break, this remarkable story spans three continents and eight decades. We begin our tale in this small town in Southern Russia. Katerinaslov as it was called... ...has not changed much in the ensuing years. Congratulations. You got lucky this time. Stay the hell out of this, you understand? He just threatened me. Isn't that enough to at least question him? I already did. Well, what did he say? He was at the motel the whole time. His wife vouches for him. - Yes, of course she did. - Jamie. Look, he tried to run me over with his car! Did you see him or get his license number? No! Hey! Hey, hey, hey! Hey! Stop, I need to talk to you. Hey. Hey. - Hi. - Hi. I got the feeling you didn't tell me everything you know about the night my niece was killed. What do you mean? Her name was Zoe. The day she was killed was her birthday. She was 17. How old are you? 15, almost 16. Going to get my driver's license then. So, did you hear anything that night? Yeah. I saw something. What did you see? I'll get in deep trouble if I tell you. My dad told me never to snitch. What's your name? Todd. Todd, this is really, really important. Zoe had a really sad life, and you can help her by telling me exactly what you know. There's this guy who has a cabin in the woods over there. My buddy Randy and I... we sometimes go in. He's got a lot of beer in there, so sometimes we take some. That night I was in there alone. I heard a car pull up. I think it was black. He was with a girl. Your niece. You saw her? Yeah. Through the window of the cabin. I snuck out the back, went in the woods. Not too long after, I heard to hear screaming, and then I saw him chase her out of the house and into the woods. Zoe! Zoe! Get away from me! Zoe! Zoe! Where are you? Zoe! Zoe! Zoe! And then, the screaming stopped all of a sudden. What did you do then? I ran home. You're not going to tell my parents about me breaking into that house and taking beer, will you? No. No, I just need to speak to them. No, please look, my dad, he will kill me if he figures out that I broke into that place. Look... if I talk to him, he'll understand. No, he won't. He will. Just... I need you to take me to your parents. I need to talk to the Sheriff. Please, Todd! Is there something wrong? No. Why? Should there be? Good. Are you going someplace? No. Why would you ask that? No reason. Jamie. Jamie! Oh, Jamie, I know you're here, and I know why you're here. Hmm? You want to come to my house? I know you're here, Jamie. I know you're right here, Jamie. Jamie. Jamie! Jamie! Jamie! No, no, no. No! No! Michael, stop! Don't do it! Evans' wife finally spilled the beans on him, and he finally confessed to everything. Micheal was having an affair with Layla also, and she was going to tell Veronique, so he killed her. And Zoe... She was going to tell people, so he killed her. Feds are coming in tomorrow, so it's out of our hands now. I've been Sheriff of this town for... 30-some-odd years. These are the only homicides on my watch. Didn't they teach you how to use those things? They said it's going to be another couple of weeks. You did well, sis. Really good. You're like a... Like a real-life detective. I owe you. You don't. We're family, that's what we do. You know, you should have this. You should keep this. Why don't we both hang on to it? You know, she was lucky to have you in her life. Nah, it was the other way around. I was lucky to have her.
