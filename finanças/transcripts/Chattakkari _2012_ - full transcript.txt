Let's pray to God that everything wiII turn out fine. Let me take Ieave. Ok, son. Daddy isn't here at this time. Then, why did you come now, JuIie? I had to see someone. - Who?

But it's not the kind of Iiking that you think it is. JuIie... - It's my name, Richard. I'm not in Iove with you or anything. No, I know that. You're behind that Warrier boy, right?
