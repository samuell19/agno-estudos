[â™ª instrumental &quot;Lonely Girl&quot;] [music continues] [music fades into tap routine music] [shoes tapping] [performers tapping] Come on, girls, a little pep. Come on, girls, snap it up. - Can you get any more play out of that thing? - That's all we can get. - That's not enough. - You ready? All right, girls, line up, face front. Parker, these are the girls for the modeling scene. Hold it, Jack. Take a breather. OK, kill the playback. [music stops] Girls, give me a slow turn, huh? All the way around. Now, that's it. [crew chatter] Blond little girl, will you step forward, please? [man] Hit that groove in the corner and swing it this way. We need a global on the one that's hitting the window. Ah, she'll be fine, real fine. [man] All right, kids, that's all. The rest of you can go. Go to room three in the wardrobe department. You know where it is? Yes, sir. - It's that way. - Oh, yes. Thank you. Thank you very much. An eager one, huh? That's some hair. Some body. What's her name? Jean Harlow. - [man] Speed. - [bell rings] [Parker] All right, action! - [playful music plays] - [cranking sound effects] Shoo. Shoo! [blows whistle] Come on, you people, get off the sidewalk here. - [people chattering] - [blows whistle] If you knew better, you'd stay away from here! Come on, you people, you gotta move it. Get off the sidewalk here. Oh, and you can stay there. - Thank you, sir. - Yes. [grunting] [indistinct shouting] [blows whistle] - All right, cut! - [bell rings] Hold it right where you are, honey, hold it. Print that one. Let's see now. Uh-huh. Hey, give me a close-up right in here, huh? [man] All right, boys, move it for a close-up. - [man 1] Light that 24. - [bell rings] - [man 2] Twenty-one, take five. - [man 1] Turn it around! - [man 3] Speed. - Turn it up here. - We got speed? - You got speed. All right, action! [playful music plays] [bubbling sounds] - [popping sound] - [water draining] [bird tweeting] Ahh! [crashing] - All right, cut. - [bell rings] - Rich, you all right? - [Rich] Yeah! Oh. Do you know where Mr. Hansen is? He went in the dressing room. - Oh, thanks. - Any time. Buddy, look, I am only the assistant director. I don't run the studio. You gotta ask him. Right. Yeah, come in. Hi, want a beer? - No. - I make it myself. No, thanks. Let's see, you're doing a scene where the finance company comes, - takes the bed away with you in it? - Mm-hm. - What are you wearing? - Oh... Well, come on, honey, take it off. I can't see through the cloth. Mm. You're the modest type. I'll close the door. Turn around. Now let's see what you look like lying down. Come on, honey. I haven't got all day. - How many days you got on this picture? - Oh, one. Like to try for five? - Now, look... - Honey. Look, I picked you out special. Now you play ball with me, I'll keep you working. No, thanks. What's the matter? Don't you wanna get ahead in this business? Sure, on my talent. Honey... honey, you're not Sara Bernhardt. You gotta make the most of what nature gave you. It's done all the time. Not by me. Take it or leave it. - Please let go of me. Please. - OK. - [woman] Operator. - Get me casting. - [man] Casting, Eddie speaking. - Hey, Eddie, - gonna need another girl for that bed scene. - OK, whom do you want? Wait a minute. Change your mind? And this time, get me a girl who isn't ashamed of her body, huh? [opera music plays] Hello, darling. Hey, sweetheart, your paycheck? There isn't any. But I have a horse running at 3:00. You better tell him to walk! [door slams] - Marino? - Yes, love? - What's wrong? - No pay. - Jean? - [sniffling] Mama. What's the matter? Oh, Mama, all they want is my body. - Well, it's a pretty one. - Yes, but I'm not a person to them, I'm a thing. I'm just hair and legs, and no face, no feelings. What happened today, Jean? Well, the assistant director got me in a dressing room... - He didn't. - He tried. It was five days work or nothing. - Take it or leave it. - And you left it. In spades. I knew you were too young for this business. It's rotten and evil. Only for those who think evil. Who sent for you? In life, you take the bitter with the sweet. How would you know? I have had my disappointments. - Mama... - Marino, she's unhappy. I am not unhappy! I'm mad! Two grown people and neither of you - bring a dollar in the house. - But how can I... What about your handsome prince here, Marino Bello? [imitates Italian accent] &quot;I will take you to sunny California. We will live in luxury and sunshine. Picking golden fruits off the trees.&quot; You will see, they will come. - Cheap, shoddy greaser. - Jean, your father... - He's my stepfather. - Nobility runs in my veins. King Liar, Prince Loafer, Count Ne'er-do-well. - Baron Loudmouth. - I turn you over my lap and spank some respect into you. I'm too smart to get that close to your lap. Stop it, stop it! That's a terrible thing to say! But we all know what he is. Words like that from your mouth, and yet, you're too good, too pure to keep your job in movies, huh? - Marino! - The day I make love, Marino Bello, it will be for myself, not for you! Not if I starve to death! - You didn't have to say that. - Oh, Mama, please. I don't feel good. - Well, I'll get you something. - No, no. Just a quiet hour alone, that's all I want. [inhales, deeply, sighs] You suppose she's lost her job for good? I don't know. After a while, you can talk her into going back? You know what you're saying? [grunts] She must become a woman someday. - Not like that. - You make too much of &quot;how&quot; and &quot;when&quot; and &quot;where.&quot; Think of it as part of life. The most beautiful satisfying part. Not for everyone. She's a passionate girl. It glows in her. It comes from you. Marino, can't you get a job? Always a job. Job, job. [groans] As if that were the purpose of life. I want something bigger and better for us. I want to promote something worthwhile. - And if I'm tied down... - But the bills we owe. We have to eat. If she can work a little while longer, then one day I'll make it all up. We'll have everything. - Money, servants. - But suppose she doesn't want to work? - She will. - Suppose she can't work. She will. She's not the kind who can do nothing. Come here. [laughs] Come on. Darling, darling. Now don't worry about our little Jean. In that slim, delicate body is a woman as strong as a marble statue. Yes, Marino, but you can't expect.... But if I took a job, what would you do for your pleasure in the day time? Hm? Mm. [chattering] Sorry, nothing today. [disappointed groans] OK, girls, now line up, face the front here. All right, you, on the stage, please. You... Betty... You, no, no, honey, not you, the girl in the back. On the stage, please. And you and you. That'll do. Thank you, girls, that'll be all. Sorry, kids, that's it. - [man] Action! - [up-beat music] - [man] Cut! Print it! - [bell rings] All right, that's one hour lunch for everybody. [chattering] [man 1] Coffee and milk over there. [man 2] Here you are, cutie. - [man 1] Were you here before? - [man 3] No, no. [man 1] One per customer. Coffee and milk over there, folks. [man 4] Thank you. [man 1] Coffee and milk over there. Coffee and milk up front by the fire. One per customer. [man 2] Here you are, cutie. - [man 1] Were you here before? - [man 5] No. [man 1] One per customer. Coffee and milk over there, folks. - [man 6] Thank you. - [man 1] Coffee and milk over there. Right over there. Coffee and milk up front, folks. - Hey, just a minute. - What's the matter, Tim? Pardon me. - Something you wanted? - Yeah. This dame. She's with me. We're making a test later. That so? Funny, they didn't tell me. I thought I knew every dame that worked in this company. Yeah, I'll bet you do. [laughs] No use wasting time with riffraff, honey. Let's go. - Like a soda? - [stammers] Yeah. - One orange. - Hiya, Arthur. Hi, Bo, glad you're working. Sit down. Sit down. Go on, eat. - Good? - Mm. - Who are you? - Oh. Arthur Landau. Talent Agent. Hm. You just struck out. Oh, I don't know. That was a wonderful performance you just gave a moment ago. Good as Chaplin. - Will you settle for 27 cents? - No. That's what I was afraid of. Here, you can keep the rest. Call the dress extra cop if you want. Oh, sit down, relax. They got more food than they know what to do with. Come on. Come on, come on, come on. Enjoy yourself, eat. Chicken looks good. You know, I've seen your work before. 'Course, generally with a lot less clothes on. Oh, now I get it. You're the same kind, it just takes you a little longer to work your way around to it, huh? You really been burned, huh? Only in thought, not in deed. Well, that's good news. Oh, well, the word's gone out over the casting drums, little Jean doesn't come across, so she doesn't come over on the screen. How long can you hold out? Oh, I got mad enough forever. And if you get hungry enough? - What do you want, Mr... - Landau. Arthur Landau. Mm, talent agent. - Talent for what? - For tomorrow's stars. Ten years I been learning this business. I got an eye. [scoffs] For hungry blond dames. It figures. I look beyond the surface. A year from now. Five years from now. I don't think of you as a hungry blond, dame. I see you as a rich, sought-after blond star. Covered with fur, chauffeured, limousine right through the front gates, to your private dressing room. We both have the same dream about me anyway. Well, it's happened before and it will again. - You have an agent? - Would I be stealing food? How about me? I get you work, you give me ten percent. Do you just go around picking up everybody? I got 12 clients. One of them in this picture. I'm an honest man. Look, I got a beautiful wife and I love her. For a dime on a dollar, you'll get more work out of me than you can from a 40-mule team. Deal? Deal. Finish the lunch, you got a call in ten minutes. - I do? Where? - Right here on this picture. Oh. Oh, I forgot one thing. - For instance? - What's your name? Harlow. Jean Harlow. I couldn't have made up a better one myself. - Oh, it's real. - Good. Hey, everything about me is real! That's good too! Don't expect this business to make any sense. It never does. It's a crap game with loaded dice. You get hot, you walk away with a bundle. - You live alone? - My mother and stepfather. - Mm. You don't like him. - I didn't say that. Your voice did. It's not what people say, it's the way they say it. Study, listen to them. A producer screams at me, calls me dirty names? I still know I'll make a deal. If he wasn't interested, I'd get a flat &quot;no.&quot; It's the same kind of acting on both sides of the camera. If you're so smart, how come you're not the biggest agent in town? Hm. It's as hard to be a good agent as it is to be a good doctor. It's a craft. It takes study, patience, time, internship. Turn left at the next corner. It's the pile of rubbish by the fire hydrant. - And don't try to imitate me. - Imitation is... Is the sincerest form of failure. You'll be you. A first, an original Jean Harlow. I can buy you a copy of Mona Lisa for ten cents. - [car honking] - Don't call your home a pile of rubbish, honey. Mm-mm. What a house looks like is unimportant. It's what goes on inside that counts. It's the pile of rubbish by the next fire hydrant. - [laughs] - OK. Well... Are you a native Californian? Immigrant. Kansas City. Some of our best beef comes from Kansas City. Now, tell me about your hair. Where'd you get the idea? - From God. - Yours? Jean Harlow original. There, you see? If you had imitated Clara Bow, I never would've noticed you. You want your ten percent? One dollar. Not much for a whole afternoon's work. A journey of 1,000 miles starts with but a single step. It won't even pay for the gas. One day, you'll resent me the ten percent. - [scoffs] Never. - Mm. Human nature. I'll call you tomorrow. Bye. Oh, and thank you so much for everything, Mr. Landau. - That wasn't necessary. - I know. That's what made it fun. - Oh, Jean. - Mm-hm? - Keep Saturday afternoon open. - What for? We're gonna spend the day at Jack Harrison's place. Jack Harrison? The big... - Movie star. - Ohh... Afternoon, you grifters. Landau is here with the staff of life. - Hi, Artie. - Hello. Gentlemen, I'd like you to meet Jean Harlow. - How do you do? - Baby. The ugly one with the curly hair that's Jack Harrison. Hi. The one sitting next to him is king of the saddle tramps, - Rex Chambers. - Mm-hm. The drunk with the cigar, that's the famous director, Dave Northcraft. And the bathing beauty, sitting on the ace, is the infamous producer - Marvin Silver. - Who just barred you from the lot. - [Jack] What do you say, Marv? - [Marvin] Can't open. All right, come and get it. Pastrami, corned beef, coleslaw and pickles, courtesy of A. Landau and company. - Up two. - Marie! Hey, take it easy on my ear. Come on, two more. - Wanna drink? - No, thanks. - How about a swim? - Huh? I, I didn't bring a suit. You wanted something, Jackie? Yeah, show her where to get a bathing suit, will you, Marie? Sure, baby, sure. [humming] Come on, honey, it's this way. - You having fun, honey? - Uh-huh! [sighs] Gee, I've never been in a place like this before. Tell me, what's likely to happen? - Honey. - Jean. Jean, all right, Jean. Look, this isn't Shanghai. It's Jack Harrison's house, USA. Those fellas in there are good guys first and men second. So, if you're worried, leave while they're still good guys - and before they become men. - Oh, I'm not afraid. - I'm not afraid. - Keep saying it, honey. Just keep saying it. - Eight, nine. - Here you are, Joanie. Ten... oh! Oh, forget it! Hey, Dave, remember the time we made the picture down in Florida - and you got shoved in the pool? - [all laughing] [indistinct chattering] Hi, honey. Jean. You... like a little drink? - No. - Just being friendly. Hey, your hair, it's still wet. Oh, well, it'll dry. Arthur? - Arthur? - Look, honey. Oh, it's such a lovely little house you have here, Mr. Harrison. What's a house? It's just a place to shack up with a book and a... and a few odds and ends. Arthur? What's the matter with you? Oh, I certainly enjoyed that swim in your pool, Mr. Harrison. Well, it would make me very happy... Wait a minute. [gasps] Please, don't touch me. Arthur! Arthur! Arthur! Arthur! What's the matter? Something happen? What the devil did you tell this girl about me? Well, Jack, she's just new in town. She's new everywhere. Well, she's seen those parts you played on the screen. - Frightened her. - Oh, now Artie, you should've told her. That's not the real me, honey. Just don't forget her name. It's Jean Harlow. Oh, I'll never forget her. Well, it's time I turn in. Nighty-night. - Night, Jack. - Oh, thank you so much for everything, Mr, Harrison. - [Jack] Artie? - Yeah? You'd better put something between her knees. They're knocking. I really messed things up, didn't I? Yep. You wanna drop me as a client? Nope. I didn't know what to expect. One thing I don't do, young lady, is procure. You have the body of a woman and the emotions of a child. I guess so. I wanted you to meet some big movie people and see them in their natural habitat. So you wouldn't be awed by them when you work with or for them. - I never will. - It's possible. But you have to get over being scared of men. Scared of them? I'm not scared of them. I'm scared of me. I don't want my career to begin and end on a couch. If he so much as touched me, I would have fallen down in a heap of nothing at his feet. - I've got it. - What? How to sell you. The sweet, beautiful girl-next-door. But on fire inside. Afraid to trust herself. Afraid of what she'll become. Provocative, sensual, to a point, and then, bam, the doors close, drives men mad. Play that character and I'll find parts for you that'll drive this town nuts. I promise. Isn't there a chance? I'm sorry, Mr. Landau, but your appointment is not until 11:00. I know, baby, but there's only one girl's part open in this picture and I gotta get in there before Travis gets in there with his client. Look at her. You wouldn't want him to miss that, would you? I could get in trouble. Look, how about two tickets to the raging fights Friday night? [chuckles] I've seen better fights in there. Right from the home office. Paris. Ten dollars an ounce. [stammers] Even if she gets the job, that's more than you'll make on commissions. Commissions, money, who cares? We're talking career. There's a face America should see. - Oh! - [man] Hold it, hold it! I told you, not in the rehearsal! - I'm sorry. - [groans] All right, you, go clean up. We'll do it again. - Yes, sir. - [man] Come on, move, move, move! Pinky, I hear you're looking for a girl for your picture. Girls I can order by the gross. Not like Jean Harlow you can't. - I've never heard of her. - You will! Pinky, she's got a shape you dream about. A smile like sunrise over the desert. Hair you wouldn't believe. White gold. - Salary to match, I suppose. - She'll work for the minimum. And I'll kickback my commission. - [man 1] Rolling. - Take five. [man 2] Speed. [man 1] All right, action please. [upbeat music plays] [doorbell chimes] Fresh eggs, madam. [honking sound] - [gunshot] - [screaming] [screams] [squeals, groans] [man] Cut! Cut! Cut, cut, cut! - Morning, Jean. - Good morning, Arthur. - Your breakfast, madam. - [exhales] Oh, Arthur, you think of everything. [groans] Five a.m. I wouldn't get up this early to get married. I've got two jobs for you today. Mm. Two pies in the puss? Two skirts ripped off? Or do I just drop in wet cement? - Would I do that to you? - Not if you could think of something worse. Today, you're going to be dressed like a lady. - [man] Action! - [orchestral music plays] - [man] Cut! Print! - [Jean] Oh! This is a wrap up. Everybody, stage 12. Yes, sir. You heard what the man said. - Move it! - Get that light over here! Did you get wet, honey? - Jean? - Hm? Jean? You're home. Oh. Tomorrow's Sunday, you can sleep late. You have a Monday morning call at seven. Oh, if I don't have pneumonia and my bones heal, and the black and blue marks don't show. You won't be doing this forever, honey. But I need film on you, any kind, anywhere I can get it. - When a big break comes... - You mean when they break my back. No, we'll have something more than talk to show. Good night. Courage. - [people laughing] - [man] How about a drink here? [Marino] Certainly! Wine is the party of the earth! - [opera music plays] - Believe me, my friends. There is buried and sunken treasure all over the world! Millions! Billions! Just waiting for someone with a few dollars in his pocket to come and find it. I have maps, handed down by my ancestors. [man laughs] Good evening, my little movie star. These are my friends. - Pleased to meet you. - And this is little Jean, whom I taught to walk, talk, move like a lady. - [laughs] - Imported wine. My little love, the California wines are as yet immature to an educated palette. Three dollars a bottle. I worked two hours for every bottle on this table. - Oh, Jean. - Yes, but who gave you the skills to earn this money? Marino Bello, no? And perhaps your agent could find a part suitable for me? He only handles people. [chuckles] Think nothing of it. A good actress is a temperamental actress. Both the curse and the joy of beauty. [all laughing] - [sighs] - Jean, darling, why must you always be so cruel to Marino? And in front of friends? I work hard for that money, Mama. - I know you do. - I let them hit me with things, tear off my clothes, hit me with fire hoses, drop me in wet cement, plaster me with mud, but not to keep that gigolo in imported wine. I know he's not a practical man. He's a leech, a bloodsucker. We have a hard enough time keeping ourselves in food, without inviting in the neighbors. - Yeah, but he means well. - Oh, I can't stand that music. - [loud chattering] - Well, it's our anniversary. Our wedding anniversary. Oh, Mama, I'm sorry! [sobs] I really am. It's all right, I understand. Couldn't he do things nicer? Yes, he could. We all could. But he's the man I married, the man I love. One day, it'll happen to you. And then you'll... you'll realize what I mean. I couldn't love a man I didn't like. Well, that sounds very profound. You could hate a man for a lot of things, and still love him without knowing why. Not me. It's gonna be everything or nothing. It can happen the way you want. Marino was for me and... I couldn't help myself. He's a good man. He just dreams too big. All right, Mama, if it's what you want, I'll try to pay for it. [groans] I'm worn out. - [sighs] - Acting is hard. Oh, I'm not an actress, Mama. I'm a punching bag. A fire they keep trying to put out. A target, a Kewpie doll on the midway. [sighs] I'm not a human being, I'm a studio prop. - [exhales] Mama? - Mm-hm. What does imported wine taste like? Well, why don't we find out? [woman] Worried about the Harlow girl? Is it wise to spend so much time with her? Is that a question or an indictment? I thought it was a question. - Mm. - Are you in love with her? Oh, for Pete's sakes, Beatrice. I have only one love. First, last, and always. Yes, I know. Your agency. - Right. - [both chuckle] No, you know it's you. It's just that... You think of her as something special. Yes, I do. She's uneducated, unpredictable, unsophisticated. And yet, she's unique. Original. A genuine first edition. - Of what? - Of innocence and sensual promise of breezy, bright, uncomplicated, clean passion. If there is such a thing. There is. Once in every girl's life. After her first love, her first man, all that breezy, bright passion will turn into the normal fear and uncertainty of womanhood. I'm talking about a professional life, not a personal one. Can you ever separate the two? Look, all I know is I got a great big, uncut diamond in my hands and I'm being forced to sell it for glass. I can't get to the big buyers with it. Here, I've got a can of film on her. Bits and pieces of everything she's done. You know what it took to get this much film on her? Years of your life. [sighs] I've used every professional trick and committed every social crime I know to keep her working. I did it for nothing, lost money. And yet, all they use her for is to dress up a picture, something for comics to squirt the water at, legs for a camera to pan up. Ah, what a business. - Come to bed, darling. - Yeah. Oh, all I know is... ...if she hits big, I hit big. She could make me the kind of agent I've always wanted to be. If I could only make her the kind of star she should be. [sighs] There's not a line of dialogue in that film. But if some producer could only see all of it at the same time. Take it to him. I can't get in to see the big boys. I'm a nobody to them until I have a somebody as a client. Richard Manley is shooting a big budget picture. Needs a girl. I can't even get through the front gate, much less his private door. They say he likes new faces. And new bodies. If I wore a size ten dress, had a 38-inch bust, that door would swing open like... That's right. Give the film to your sensual protege and let her. Mm-hm. You know something? I'd like to take you in as a partner. Any time, Mr. Landau. [sound effects in film play] [woman screams] [man grunting] [woman screams] [whistle blows] Look at that. How when she smiles, she lights up the whole set. And when she walks, look at everybody watching her. - They can't take their eyes off her. - Mr... Mr... - Landau, Arthur Landau. - I'm already seeing the merchandise. - Don't hustle me. - Just trying to point out things. Either I feel it or I don't. I have breakfast cereal in the morning, I don't have to read the box afterward to find out if I enjoyed it. Yes, sir, Mr. Manley. [screaming] [Jean groaning] [turns film off] [sighs] You have any film on her with dialogue in it? Well, you see, I put this together in such a hurry, that I didn't get a... No. Well, how do we know she can talk? W... Of course she can talk. Jean, get up and say something. The Pledge Allegiance to the flag, do you know that? We all know it, Mr. Landau. What I'm interested in is how she sounds on film. Well, we could make a test. Why not? A good test would cost me $3,000. Maybe I could pay for half of it? That's not the point, Mr. Landau. If I make a test and it's good, and we can't make a deal afterwards, I've wasted time and money. You tell me now. What do you want for Jean Harlow? How much? Ironclad, three year contract with no options. Two hundred dollars a week if she's not working, two-fifty a week when she is. And $50 raises the second and third years. And she reports for wardrobe and rehearsals in ten days. Now, Mrs. Bello, you sign right here. One moment, if you please. Is it advisable to sign this document? Well, she's underage, you have to sign for her. Listen to me first, I am a man of experience. - All bad. - I ask you, how many movie theaters - are there in America? - Oh, who cares? Oh, I don't know, 14, maybe 15,000. Exactly! If this producer, Manley, gets only one dollar, an absolute amount for this movie, one dollar from each theater, he will have twice as much money as that contract is worth. That's fascinating. Now, Mrs. Bello, would you mind signing right there, please? - One moment, love. - Oh, Marino... This man stands to make a fortune off her work. And he throws us a few pieces of pasta, pennies. Not us, me! Two hundred dollars a week is a... is an insult. [scoffs] It's more than you made last year. Well, what do you have in mind, Mr. Bello? You see? He listens to me. A thousand dollars a week, would be more to my liking. With $500 raises each year. - That's ridiculous. - Is that all? For the moment. I might have other ideas later. Now let me explain some facts of life to you, Mr. Bello. - Mm. - The easiest thing to come by in this town is money, after you have a hit. The hardest thing to get is the first big chance. Now what you don't know and Manley doesn't know, is that I would've given him Jean for nothing. I might even have paid him to get her a leading part in a big picture with three top male stars in it. Yeah, so just shut up and let Mama sign. Shall I, Marino? No. I made a verbal deal with Manley, an oral contract, gave my word. You had no right to. Perhaps there is room in this agency business for new blood. And a lot of yours is gonna be spilled if you don't let her sign it right now! Jean, please, if you insult your father once more, - I won't sign the contract. - Mama, we owe $500! The rent, the butcher, the telephone, his gambling debts! You don't own a decent pair of shoes and he's got two suits in the cleaners we can't afford to get out! Now sign it right now, please! You just bought yourself a new agent, kid! Get your hand off me! I spent a hard, profitless year getting you this far. Your family can do what it wants with your life, but not mine. I have one asset in this business, my word is my bond! I gave it, I won't change it! We could've gone far, all gotten rich. - [grumbles] - Oh, Arthur, please don't go! You are not gonna ruin my life and get away with it! Mama, do you want me to tell you about this, this lover of yours? - Your great Latin bed partner? - Jean! You want me to tell you what he tried to do, wanted to do ever since he got in this house? Do you want me to tell you?! No! Don't! I don't want to hear it! Not another word. Mr. Landau, can I have those papers, please? You've said enough already, Marino. We all have. [applause in theater] - [sobbing] - Don't, honey. Oh, it was awful! - Terrible. - Oh, sweetheart. I walked scared, talked scared. - I was scared. - Oh, but the dresses were beautiful. - Oh, Mama. - [speaks Italian] - What does that mean? - Tears at night, happiness in the morning. As my noble ancestors used to say... - [speaks Italian] - Oh, shut up. All right. The picture got good reviews, she didn't. I saw the first picture you ever made, Mr. Manley. The studio released it in Timbuktu. I put up my own money for the next picture, can you do that for her? - No. - Then let me finish. As I said, they didn't go for her as an actress. They went for her as a woman, a sex symbol. &quot;She can't act her way out of a paper bag, but in a black negligee she had the boys standing on their heads.&quot; &quot;The sexiest figure I've seen in front of a camera in years.&quot; &quot;As a critic, I found her voice scratchy and her manner untalented. As a man, I kept on thinking, 'Oh, you kid.'&quot; And the preview cards. &quot;Wow.&quot; &quot;The plot got in the way of that dame.&quot; &quot;What's her number?&quot; &quot;She had great lines, starting from her neck down.&quot; I want to send her out on a personal appearance tour with the picture. For a percentage of the house? For $250 a week, plus expenses. I gambled a lot of money on that woman, I intend to get it back if she has to do a striptease six times a day. Will she cooperate, Mr. Landau? Completely, Mr. Manley. [orchestra playing prelude] [crowd cheering] Oh, you've all been so wonderful to me. I don't know where to begin. Start at the top, baby and work down! [audience laughing] [orchestra resumes playing] One of the local critics said that I wasn't a real actress. Does any part of me look false? [audience applauds, shouts] No! Well, no matter how he feels about me, he's wrong. [audience laughing] [audience applauds, cheers] Someone in the audience wants to know: what do I have on when I go to bed? - My alarm clock. - [audience laughs] [man on PA, indistinct] This way, Miss Harlow! Thank you! Miss Harlow, what do you think a man looks for in a woman? What he doesn't see in his wife. - [men chuckling] - How do you like Cleveland? How can I tell? I've only met half of it, the men. Miss Harlow, do you think the world's becoming too sex conscious lately? Why don't we wait until next year to see the population figures? Do you think a woman can get by on looks alone? If she gets them from the right man. [man] Speaking of that, how does Richard Manley look at you? Well, what do you mean by that? Well, the rumor's out that he's asked you to marry him. Oh, Richard Manley doesn't usually ask anything, he orders. Would you? Marrying Richard Manley would be like drinking near beer, awfully thin in body and very low in content. - High enough? - Just great. Sorry, gentlemen, we have time for just one more picture. Thank you. Come, darling. - Thank you, Miss Harlow. - The bags, please. [all chattering] - Jean! - Arthur! Am I glad to see you! It seems like years! Let me look at you. Oh, you look like a different girl! Can't play to half a million peeping toms without it doing something to you. Yeah, but you handled yourself well. I got an office full of clippings. Hello, Mr. Landau, how are you? And a crate full of unpaid bills. - Mrs. Bello. - Hello, Arthur. Hm, gold-tip ebony cane, $80 shoes. Ah, Cuban cigar, ten dollar tie. - Is that diamond real? - Of course. Good jewelry is an investment. - Mr. Bello... - Oh, come on. I want to hear about everything. What's been happening, what am I going to do next? - Yours? - Well, it's all your fault. You forced me to act like a successful agent. - Oh! - Marvelous car, but where do we...? You take that taxi and the luggage. All right. - Come, my love. - And don't forget to tip them well. Of course. When you made that crack about Manley, it wasn't exactly in the script. Oh, I know. Only I just got tired of giving out those same stale answers over and over and decided to make one up myself. It got back to him. - What did he say? - He laughed. - He did? - And then said, &quot;Bring her up to my house.&quot; What does that mean? What do you think? What did you say? I said yes. - You didn't? - Yep. Arthur Landau, you once told me - in no uncertain terms, that you never... - Procured. Yes, I couldn't think of the word. But all you really meant was you'd never do it for small stakes. - I have something to say about what happens to me. - Will you shut up? Richard Manley isn't an ordinary fellow. - He doesn't make love to ordinary women. - I couldn't care less. He put out on this tour not only to help the picture, but to make you a big name, and he's done it. Clothes, special material, interviews, pictures. All for one purpose: so you'd be important enough for his ego to make love to. - And you knew. - Of course I knew. It's the biggest break you could ever get. [scoffs] That's what you think? Oh! Well, you're just Marino Bello in another form. The important thing is we've gotta get you out of this contract. - By going up to his house? - Manley doesn't make pictures fast enough. It could be months before he finds another part to fit you. And, Jean, you've got a good start. I wanna keep you in front of the camera every single day. - Well, we're work somewhere else. - He'll never let you. And you'll sit on that good-looking, much photographed, highly-publicized... You might've said &quot;lovely&quot; instead of &quot;good-looking.&quot; And you will slowly die on the vine and never be heard from again. Oh, what a happy homecoming this is. Ahh. You care to take a big gamble? By doing what? By going up to his house. Arthur, I don't think I understand you. You will. Now, let me show you upstairs. All right. Please. [clicks on PA system] [slow music plays] I like anything. If you don't care for that, there's jazz, classical, opera. Anything but opera. Your trophy room. Hm? Just a few of the girls I helped make famous. I'd... like to see your picture up there. I'd rather see it on the cover of Photoplay. Everything's possible, sweetheart... ...if a person knows the route. Here, let me show you my room. [Jean gasps] Ohh! - You like it? - Is this... Is this real? Real? This is just the beginning. It's a dressing room. It's beautiful. Hers. His and the bath. And... ...for that exciting, sensual feeling of exotic nature, in the raw. [rain falling] [gasps] - You like it? - I don't know if I'm in heaven or hell. You think you could be comfortable here? Who couldn't? - With me? - I don't think so, Mr. Manley. Oh, call me Richard. I don't know you well enough and... I don't want to. The man who gave you your big break? Who could make you a name that this town would never forget? [nervous laugh] I know the name, it wouldn't sound nice. - You got a quick mind. - And quick feet. Stop chasing me. - Come here. - No. [glass shatters] - Why did you accept my invitation? - For dinner. You must've known what I wanted. That doesn't mean I have to give in to you. I've already bought and paid for you. - That's what you think. - You tramp! [groans] Not yet, I'm not! Just what makes you so different? Because I'm me, Jean Harlow, not one of those trophies on your wall! Before you get out of here you will be! You'll have to kill me first! - Go on, get out of here! - Not before I tell you what I think of you! - You already have! Get going! - You're a dirty animal of a person! - I give and I can take away! - You ought to be locked up! - You'll never work for me again! - I never want to! You were nobody when I picked you up and you'll be even less when I drop you! - I'll be smarter! - You can't even act! - You're a physical curiosity! - When I wanna be loved, I won't have to buy it, beg for it or beat somebody into it. - You OK, Jean? - I got out intact. - Well? - It worked. I've never seen a man so mad. I insulted everything about him. He can't wait to give my contract away. - Well, that's good news... - Go on, take me home. - [winces] - Was it that bad? It was a terrible thing to do to anybody. - To him or you? - Both of us. I don't care much about him. After all, think of why he brought you there. But I value you. He said I couldn't act. Oh, I wish I had that scene in the bedroom on film. - Got you as far as the bedroom? - Mm-hm. - And Arthur? - Yes? - I didn't really want to leave. - [starts engine] Oh, I hope you know what you're doing. So do I. - [man] Sixty thousand dollars, is that what you said? - Mm-hm. [laughs] Sixty thousand dollars. Mr. Landau... Mr. Landau, for $60,000 I can buy the entire chorus line at the Roxy theater. Maybe even the theater. I didn't set the price, Mr. Redman. - Mr. Manley did himself. - Oh, he did? - Unreasonable. - Did you see her picture? Mm-hm. I saw it. Did you read the reviews of the tour? I did better than that, Mr. Landau. I saw her myself on the stage in New York. Then you were interested. I follow everything in this business. To know what to avoid, as well as what to do. Well, she was a big hit. In a small way. Look, Mr. Landau, we make pictures at this studio to please millions of people. Hear what I'm saying? Millions. And not only here in America, but all over the world. Now, we can't limit ourselves to the... the what, the burlesque crowd who goes to watch a girl in a silk, tight dress tell dirty jokes? - They weren't dirty jokes. - Very close to it, very close. Believe me. Mr. Landau, we make family pictures here. For the family. Musicals, comedies, stories about small boys, dogs, history, adventure. Look at these plaques here, the awards here. Look over here. Did you ever see such a collection like that? Huh? It's something, isn't it? Can you show me one award that was given to a girl who stood up in public in her underwear? Well, thanks for your time, Mr. Redman. I just thought I'd give you a chance at a star of tomorrow. Sit down, I'm not through yet. - Somebody there? - [woman] Yes, sir. I want Sally Doane and Paul Bern in here right away, please. Well, Mr. Landau... [chuckles] ...times change, don't they? Sometimes you have to change with them. Now Miss Doane, Miss Doane has her finger on the public pulse. And Mr. Bern is a man of... education... ...refinement, judgment, and yet, showmanship, believe me. And fortunately for me, for me, he never learned ruthlessness. Miss Doane, this is Mr. Landau. - How do you do? - How do you do? Sit down, darling. Miss Doane... Sit down. Miss Doane, what is America reading today? Mystery stories with hard-hitting action and sex. War novels with violence and sex. Biographies with psychiatry and sex. [Redman] I see. What plays are they seeing? Drawing room comedies and musicals with sex. OK. Do you think sex is here to stay? - [chuckles] - I mean in the entertainment field. Please! Pictures. Well, it's always been here, sir, only in a smirking way. Well, what other way is there? [chuckles] You mean something exists called good clean sex? That's not an easy question to answer. Well, my dear, I don't pay you $500 a week to ask you easy questions. Ah. Mr. Bern. Mr. Landau, I'd like you to meet Mr. Bern. - Nice to meet you, Mr. Landau. - Likewise, Mr. Bern. We must lose a month a year at the studio, shaking hands. Sit down, sit down. Paul, Mr. Landau here is peddling a girl called Jean Harlow. - Yes, I've seen her. - You have? What do you think of her? I think she's gonna be very important. [Redman] Mm. Why? She's what the audience wants to see today. Sweet and clean enough to respect one moment, passionate enough the next to... ...well, excite the baser emotions. It's an unusual combination. The girl we wanna marry and have as a mistress. Why didn't you tell me this before? I didn't know you were interested. I'm not, I'm interested in making money! Well, I can see that this is inevitable. The time has come for us to start making sex films for the family. Hm. And Mr. Landau, you are a very lucky man. My own greed and the weakness of the human race could make you very rich, you hear? Very rich. Hm. [chuckles] - Oh! Oh! - [telephone ringing] - Oh, it's beautiful! - Jean Harlow's dressing room. - Oh, Arthur! - Yes, she just arrived. - Yes. - Oh! - Thank you. - A kitchen, a stove, a shower! Mirrors, everything! Oh, I could live here, it's better than my own house! Mama Jean and Marino. Mr. Everett Redman himself! Wow! Oh, Arthur, you shouldn't have. - Paul Bern. - Redman's right hand man. - I told you about him. - The one who liked me? Oh, well I like him. [Jack] Yeah, that one's from me. Oh, Mr. Harrison. - Hi. - Hi. The booze set me back so far, I didn't have anything left for a card. - Oh, thanks so much. - Welcome to the velvet prison. Thanks again. Pardon me. I hate to break this up. Well, if it isn't the gentle thief. - Hi, ugly. - Finally made the big time. Well, I figured if you made it, there was still room for real talent. Redman called. I've gotta go over to the administration building. As a matter of fact, I asked him to get you out of here. - I better leave the door open. - You know your client better than I do. Let's have a drink. No, no, no. None of that bubble bath. I mean something that'll stick to the ribs. Yeah, I figured I'd better keep a little of this around to drink when I'm over here. - Drink in the daytime? - I tried drinking in my sleep, - didn't work out. - [chuckles] Oh. Oh, Well, where's your dressing room, Mr. Harrison? Jack. My dressing room? Right next door. Excuse me. Oh, sorry. You really know your way around, huh? Yeah, it used to be Irma Morelli's dressing room. Oh, imagine, Irma Morelli. Whatever happened to her? She fell victim to an attack of common sense. Quit. She got out of the business while she still had some of her looks, sanity and morals left. And that's what you ought to do. Don't even sit down. Turn right around and walk out of here. [chuckles] Looks like a funeral. It is. Yours, if you stay here. You know they're gonna bury your past. All this, you, the way you talk, it's like a scene out of a movie. Yeah, and after a while, nothing will seem real to you. And don't be too flattered with this dressing room. You know, they've got a dog on this lot who's got a better one. To the loveliest and nicest girl who ever showed up on this lot. Oh, well, thank you, Mr... [chuckles] ...Jack. To the handsomest and most interesting man I've ever met. Well, I'll drink to that! - So you wanna be a movie star, hm? - Well... You think the hard work and struggle is all behind you? That you finally hit the big time? - Of course not. - Everything you did to get here is nothing compared to what they've got planned for you now. You see, you're a piece of meat. They'll run you through the meat grinder, they'll season and shape you, and then they'll... roll you into nice little meatballs and throw them to the public a little at a time to eat you up, till there's nothing left but the bones. I don't know. You look like you've survived. Yeah. Well, the day before I walked on this lot, I was twice the man I am now. But I've still got a chance. As a matter of fact, we both do, if we act now. What do we have to do? Marry me. We'll run away together somewhere. Well, why not? I haven't married anybody all day. I've got a little money put aside. - Come on, let's go! - [laughs] Oh, you're not really serious, are you? Yes, I am. There's something about you I've liked from the minute I saw you standing in my house that day, looking so scared. I'd really like to marry you, Jean. - Oh. - I'm Paul Bern. - Oh, please come in, Mr. Bern. - Thank you. - How are you, Paul? - Fine, Jack, thank you. I was just putting her through the freshman initiation ceremony. - She's a good sport. - Thank you so much for the beautiful flowers, Mr. Bern. It's my pleasure, Miss Harlow. Oh, come on, let's cut out this mister and miss stuff, huh? Next thing you know, we'll have to knock before entering. Well put. Or should I say, well remembered? Touche. So, I got it from a writer. Miss Harlow, I thought you might like to take a tour of the studio. - Oh. - And I'm leaving for Mexico, officially. - Well, good luck. - Never give luck away, sweetheart. It's too hard to find when you need it. [chuckles] [piano plays up-tempo music] All right, hold it, hold it. Let's take it again from the beginning. Jean. Beat it out this time. - OK. - [piano resumes] [gasps] [indistinct chattering] Will someone sit down, please? That's it. Oh, dear, you dogs. What a day, what a day. You beasts. All right, Miss Harlow, smile. [car horn honking] Miss Harlow, your car is ready. - My car? - We bought it today. We did? With what? Some money, some credit. You have to live up to your position in the world. Hm. I don't have time to live. You will. The rewards are only beginning to roll in. - New jacket, huh? - Of course. New jacket for a new business. My card. Pardon, please. Marino Bello, investment counselor. [laughing] That's a laugh. You won't think so a year from now. This is a new city, a new state. There will be a demand for oil, gas, real estate, buildings. We'll grow with it. All the investments you ever made, Marino, came in fourth. Not all. I always believed in you, Jean. - That's true. - And wait. Wait until you see how well I've used... our money. - The investment I made. - Oh, no. Your mother and I have decided to take over the management of our mutual incomes. - What did you buy? - Only some land. - Where? - Where, where, where! Underneath a new house we are going to live in. - Befitting your station in life. - Marino, so help me... For once, why don't you give me a chance, Jean? I have had bad luck, yes, but I also have taste and judgment. I've helped make your mother happy, no? Perhaps I could do the same thing for all of us, hm? Maybe you could at that. Oh, anyway... it's only money. You see, it's the dawn of a new day for us, my little Jean. [singing in Italian] [honks horn] Tilt your head just a little more to the right, Miss Harlow. That's it. Just, no, just a little too much. That's it now. Hold it, hold it. What a gorgeous hairdo, Miss Harlow. It's just gorgeous. Hold it. That's lovely, just lovely. Boys, bring the rope. Put that first one here. - [woman 1] Harlow. - Harlow. - Harlow. - Harlow. - Harlow. Harlow. - Harlow. - [woman 1] Harlow. Harlow. - Harlow. Harrison. - [woman 1] Harlow. - Harlow. [man] And Mr. and Mrs. Everett Redman. Give them a nice hand. - And here she comes now... - [crowd roaring with cheers] ...Miss Jean Harlow and Mr. Jack Harrison! Give them a great big hand! Oops, now I know the end is near. They gave you top billing over me. - Ladies first. - Not in this business, sweetheart. You're first when you earn it and you are the hottest thing since sunburn. - Ready to run the gauntlet? - Wait till I take a deep breath. Oh, you showoff. Let's go. Goes straight to your heart, doesn't it? All this frantic adoration. It scares me. You ought to read my fan mail. - You get the letter I wrote? - Censors burned it. - You know, you look tired. - Your hair's turning gray. [man] Nice big kiss, Miss Harlow? Why don't we get a place at the beach this weekend? Just lie around and lap up the booze, huh? My mother told me never to lie around. Well, we could stay home and start our own nudist colony. I promised Paul Bern. Oh, just a concert and dinner. All you're gonna get out of that, sweetheart, is a stiff neck and indigestion. Same thing you're offering me, isn't it? [slow, romantic music] What are you thinking about? Well, I was wondering what you were thinking of. Oh, movies. - That's nice. - And you. No, don't laugh. You're both important cultural influences. Me, a cultural influence? Low-cut dresses, bubble bath, bedrooms. Life doesn't move on philosophy alone. No, I suppose there are other things, like, oh, money... fear. And passion? My critics call it &quot;sin.&quot; I often wonder whether critics ever fall in love. Mm. Not mine. Your public does, hundreds and thousands, just by watching you. I'll have to go and see some of my own movies. Two double features and you'll quit working. Marry the first attractive, intelligent man who asked you. Anybody we know? I'll draw a test. One. - Seriously, Paul. - I'm serious, Jean. I've seen every picture you've made twice. You've made me a firm believer. Do you think there'll ever be a chance for me to play better parts? I just offered you one. - Thank you, but I... - Jean... Don't turn it down before you think it over. It's the best part ever written for you. You'll have to talk to my agent. He makes all my deals. - [playing up-tempo music] - [audience cheering] [classical music playing] [crowd roaring] Come on, throw the left! The left! The left! - Oh! - Oh, come on! All right, hook him! Hook him, hook him! [groans] All right, baby! Jab! Jab! - Jab! Jab! - Jab! - Attaboy! - Did he do it? - No. - Oh. - [thudding] - [cheering] [man] Two! Three! Four! Five! [Redman] Jack, my boy, I'm not in the habit of giving advice to people. [Jack] You mean free. What a man does in his personal life is completely his own affair. Of course. Unless he happens to be under contract to Majestic. [chuckles] Listen, have I ever before asked a personal favor of you? - Not yet. - Ah. Well, I'm not gonna ask one now. As a matter of fact, - I'm gonna do you a favor. - It's worse than I thought. - You like Jean Harlow? - I like Jean Harlow. - Jean Harlow likes you. - Scans great, why don't you put it to music? Listen, you're single, she's single. You're a star, she's a star. You're both made for each other. You have my permission to marry her. Of course, the only thing that's held me back, worrying whether you'd approve. And you have my blessings. Of course, this is just between the two of us. Oh, I'd never rat on a blessing. But tell me, tell me, Everett, any reason for this sudden burst of generosity and confidence? [exhales] Of course. Of course there's a reason. There's always a reason. Paul Bern, he's lost his head over her. He can't work, he can't think, he... stares at her picture all day long. He moons around the set like a lost dog. He's absolutely useless to me. - Why don't you give him permission to marry her? - Why? Because, my friend, we have here a star, with the body of a chorus girl. A juvenile mind, a certain attractive coarseness in manner and speech. You are more her type. - You're all charm. - And we have enough trouble with these girls without Paul Bern educating her. - He's got her reading books. - No! - Yeah. - The nerve. Reciting poetry, listening to string quartets. - What is the world coming to? - I don't know. Next thing you know, she'll have a Harvard accent, be too much of a lady to take off her negligee, hop in the bathtub and kiss the plumber. [both laugh] Yeah, laugh. It's funny, it's funny. You know, the day... The day that Jean Harlow becomes Lady Harlow, she becomes worthless to us. And we lose money. - Well, you're honest anyway. - Well, not completely. You also strike me as a man who's not fascinated with children. This already could save me six months of Harlow's time every two years. Oh. I would like to give the bride away. You've certainly tried to. Now, all we need is for Jean to see it your way. That's no problem. You always get the girl in the pictures, don't you? If you need any help, I'll loan you some writers. It's been nice chatting with you. [soft, instrumental music] Jean? Are you all right? I guess so, Mama. Would you like a cup of coffee? No thank you. Marino and I missed you after dinner. I thought we were gonna play Parcheesi. Oh, I felt like coming up here. - There's not much to do here all alone. - You're telling me. A bedroom with only one person in it is the loneliest room in the world. I didn't mean that. That's because you never have to think about it. Your bedroom's never empty and always busy, judging by the sounds I hear from it. - Now I'm embarrassed. - Oh, don't be. I've heard them for years. Especially when we lived in that cracker box downtown. Tell me truthfully, Mama. Is Marino that exciting? Jean Harlow, what a terrible thing to ask your mother. [laughs] Well, if it's not terrible to do, why is it terrible to talk about? I don't know why, but it is. Oh, don't you see? I envy your satisfaction with Marino. You know, that's the first nice thing you've ever said about him. Well, I still can't stand him. But he does seem to have some special knowledge about life. You know, before you came up here, I was examining my body in the mirror. Trying to see what makes it different, why the public goes crazy over it. I look pretty ordinary to me. It's the way you carry yourself, the way you act. Yes, but I don't really know what I do or why I do it. Well, it's natural. It's an instinct. And don't forget, people also read into someone what they want to find themselves. Yes, but it makes me afraid of myself. - But why? - Well, because I want love to be something special to me. And doesn't every girl? Yes, but I don't want it to be cheap or even ordinary. I want it to be like Richard Manley's bedroom. - [chuckles] - All colored lights and flowers, music and tropical rain. Well, maybe it will be. [laughs] Oh, Mama. Wouldn't my public die laughing if they could hear me now? [both laughing] Oh, Jean, darling, everybody in the world, man or woman, has the same problem. Find someone you love. Marry him and let nature take its course. - You make it sound so simple. - It is. [bells chiming] It just can't be true. I'm sorry, Jack, but it is. But I asked you first. And he asked me last. I had to learn it from a newspaper, huh? Oh, I am sorry about that. I meant to tell you myself. Why, Jean? Why Paul Bern instead of me? Because I'm not dependable, he is? Because I'm not educated, he is? Because I have a reputation with women and he doesn't? Because he can help your career, I can't? - Now, Jack... - It's true, isn't it? - Everything I've said about us. - Yes, but it's the way that you say it. What, bitter, cruel, disappointed? Well, I am, Jean. I don't lose a girl like you every day. Oh, Jack. I wish there was something I could say. Maybe... Maybe you better not say anything. Just invite me to the wedding. You mean you wanna come? I'm... practically one of the family. Well, will you promise to stay sober and not cause any trouble? Promise. If I get to kiss the bride. Oh, only in front of witnesses. I'd better get my private kissing in now. [man] Mr. Bern? Mr. Bern, will you kiss her again, please? Hold it. - Fine. - Thank you. - One more, please. - That'll be enough. Thank you. Paul, congratulations. You have a remarkable wife here, don't try to change her. And two children, you hear? No more. All right. Congratulations, Jean. Try to stay the same, unspoiled movie star you always were. The world's unluckiest man would like to congratulate the luckiest. - Thank you, Jack. - Now, the only reason I'm here. - Congratulations, Paul. - Thank you, Arthur. I hope you're as happy with her as I've been. - So long, sweetheart. - See you at the studio. Jean... It's been a long road to here, Jean. And a wonderful one, thanks to you. All I did was direct traffic a little. Take care. Jean, keep happy. Mr. Bern, you are now married to royalty in a woman. Treat her like a queen. - I'll do my best. - And after the wonderful honeymoon, we should get together more often. Discuss the man's world of finance and investments, huh? Oh, yes, yes. We must do that sometime. You've never looked lovelier, darling, never. You are breaking your stepfather's heart. But... that's the way of the world. Let's cut the cake, shall we? Looks like the cake from Yukon Fever. - Well, it is. - The one I fell in? Yes. - Darling. - Wait for the picture. Hold it, please. - Thank you. - Mm. - You're shaking. - I thought it was you. - I love you. - I hope you always will. Oh, cut out the mush. I'm hungry. [cheering] [horn honks] - Where are they going on their honeymoon? - To his house. They both report to work on Monday. Oh, you've got a heart of pure lead. Don't criticize me, you betrayer. You let me down. - I'm thoroughly ashamed of myself. - Mm. [clock chiming] [car approaching] [car door opens, closes] [doorbell ringing rapidly] - Jean? Jean, what's wrong? Why are you here? - [sobbing] Oh, Arthur! Arthur! I wish I were dead. What happened? He would've killed me if he could, I know it. - What happened? - Oh, you're hurting me! - Arthur! - Beatrice, get me a drink, please. - You don't need a drink. - I need one. - I'll get it. - [sobbing] Sit down. We had a fight. - On your wedding night? - He knocked me down. - But why? - I don't know what happened. I don't think he meant to, but I was trying to get out. - He was trying to keep me there. - Here, dear. [gasps] Your face! - I hurt somewhere in the back. - Let me see. Oh, my God! It's all red and swollen. I fell backward over a coffee table. In God's name, what happened?! - We had a fight. - You said that! Well, it all happened so quick. - What caused it? - I did, I did. I got mad at him. Why? Oh, Arthur, Beatrice. He didn't want a wife. He wanted a mother, a companion. A decoration. He... he's... He couldn't make love. He's never been able to. The man I waited for, saved myself for, didn't even want me. Oh, I prayed for it to be beautiful. And it was ugly! Oh, it was so awful! He... He got down on his knees, and kissed my legs, and begged me to understand. To stay with him. - Jean, don't say it. - No, I have to! I tried to get out of the house. I ran, he grabbed me, begging and pleading. He said that I could live with him and find passion wherever I wanted. We had a terrible fight. I said awful things to him. And then everything exploded, and I, I landed on the floor in broken glass and upside down furniture. I can't believe it. He just stood there, frozen. As if he couldn't understand what happened. Then I grabbed my coat and ran out. Oh, I don't even know how I got here. I was crying so hard, I couldn't see. Oh, Arthur, what am I gonna do? - [sobbing] - I... I don't know. Well, I do. We're going to call Dr. Parkman. No! Not yet! This whole thing could get out! She needs a doctor to look at her! I said no! Oh, boy. Gentle, considerate Paul Bern. Whew, that's beyond belief. Has the jury reached a decision yet? Oh, don't give me that line about our obligation to our public. We have one, you know? The public feeds on our shortcomings more than it does on our virtues. If the public disowns us, we still live with our problems. So let's approach things from a proper end. Ourselves. You mean yourself? We all have flaws. You're infected with commercial greed, Jean with romantic vanity. For myself... Oh, let's cut out the second-rate philosophy and get down to brass tacks. You're the cause of all our troubles. So what are you gonna do about it? I thought you were gonna tell me. All right, I will. You and Jean live apart for a reasonable time... - and then we'll quietly go down and... - The reporters will find out - in two days. - You don't expect her to live here? For better or for worse. We married! Where was the better?! - We didn't have time to find it. - Huh! From the way she looks, she wouldn't have lived long enough. - Jean, does your agent do all your talking? - No. Well, you've had your ten percent of conversation. Now get out of here! - Not on your tintype. - I said out! - Oh, brother, that's what I've been waiting for! - No! No! Stop it! Stop it! - Both of you! - Keep your guard up, Jean, - his type would prefer to hit women. - Paul, please don't! - Go ahead, let him go! - You're doing this deliberately! - You're damn right I am! - Arthur, let me talk to him alone. - Huh! We can't afford the medical bills. - Oh, please! [sighs] All right, Jean. Just had to get it out of my system. I'll be waiting right outside just in case. [door closes] Paul, why did you marry me? 'Cause I loved you. I loved you before I met you. I sold you to Redman. I was your agent. - How could you love me when... - It's not impossible. Nothing is. I thought you could help me. Why didn't you tell me before? 'Cause then I wouldn't have stood a chance. - No, don't touch me. - Jean, don't be afraid. I'll give you love in every way. Except the one that counts. In time. Just help me. [sighs] Fifty million men and I had to marry you. Jean, I... I can do so much for you. - Teach you. - I can get books at the library. And music at the record shop. But where do I go to become a bride, a wife, a mother, if not to the man I married for those things? Jean, help me over this. And what if I can't help you? You're the love goddess of the world, aren't you? [scoffs] Created out of nightgowns and publicity releases. You ought to know how fake it is. I'm just an ordinary woman with the same ordinary fears and problems. Then you should understand my problem. I said &quot;ordinary.&quot; There's only one thing for us to do and that's get an annulment. - All those headlines? - I didn't write them. [sighs] We'll be the laughingstock of the world. Well, I can stand it. Well, I can't! You have to, it's the only way! Now, Jean, I'll get help. I'll go to a doctor, - A psychiatrist... - You should've done that long ago. Give me a chance! Give me time. I couldn't live if I... ...couldn't make it up to you. Oh. Oh, it's all so sick. Jean? Don't expose me to people for what I am. I can't live your life. I've got my hands full with my own. [siren blares] [telephone ringing] Yeah? - Yeah. - [knocking] Hey, Paul Bern shot himself. - Paul who? - Paul Bern, the guy who married Harlow. - When, where? - In his bedroom, sometime during the night. - Who've we got to cover it? - Berkins, Adler and Thompson are on their way now. - Well, is he dead? - I don't know. - Where's Harlow? - Hey, where's Harlow? - Nobody knows. - Good! Now we got us a two week story! I hope they keep him alive until we get a statement. [siren blares] Harlow in hiding! Extra, read all about it! Extra! Paper, paper! Hollywood's sympathy goes to Jean. Jean, they're waiting for you. Jean? - Mama? - Yes, dear. I don't wanna go. You have to, Jean. Why? [Arthur] Because he was your husband. Yesterday, I was at the top of the world. Today, I'm at the bottom. Oh, no, you're not. Oh, you should see the letters and the telegrams. Jean, today you have to think about Paul, not yourself. Did he ever think abut me? From the beginning to the end, he only thought about himself. Don't say things about the dead. There's nobody deader than I am right now. But I guarantee all of you... ...that I won't be by tomorrow. Work? Ah, who said anything about work? - I did. - Jean, you're a little girl who suffered a big tragedy. You deserve a vacation, you need one. The public... - &quot;The public.&quot; - The public pays for you, gives you your living. Forgave your misfortune. Now you owe them... All I owe them is a good show every four months. I want a picture now and another one and one after that. Such determination. What do you hope to prove? That I'm alive! Every inch of me, every part of me. It isn't necessary. Think of what I'm worth now. I'm a curiosity. - A woman who's so hot that her husband... - Please, don't talk like that. ...that her husband killed himself because he couldn't satisfy her. Please, Jean, leave him lie in peace. Look how they'd line up for that. Doesn't it excite that ticket window you call a heart? Not under these circumstances and I don't deserve such a judgment. Everett, please, she just wants to work so she won't have to think. Wrong. I want to work because it's the only thing I ever learned to do in this world. I'm going down to my dressing room. I want to read scripts. Arthur... Arthur, the terrible thing about this business is people begin to believe the parts that they play. They're always beautiful, always loved and never alone, never tired, nor dirty or disappointed. You give them a lead in a picture, they want a lead in life. And the one good part they once prayed to get, they now demand 24 hours a day. Well, we gave birth to Jean Harlow, the star. And we're responsible for her care and feeding. The kind of food she requires exists only on paper. She'll starve. Six months. Six months, two completed movies and... - And two cases of whiskey. - [laughs] Well, it was brewed to be drunk. Everything in this world was made to be used, right? - Mm. I suppose so. - Hm. You, me, money, time, friends, name it. - Where's Mama? - Gone to the movies. Poor thing, she's just escaping life. It's just an illusion, nobody can do it. Watch what you are doing! Those are valuable oil maps! [chuckles] The best things in life are above ground. You are tired of supporting me, huh? But I'm trying to earn my own way. Don't try to be what you're not. Be what you are. Mm. A night for philosophy. You're a man who lives off women. - Now... - Oh, that's not bad, if you make them happy. You make Mama Jean very happy at night. [sighs] Six months. My period of mourning is over. I've done the decent thing. The decent memory of my late and too decent husband. You used to like me once, remember? And I still do. Oh, Marino, I need help. The kind of help you seem to be expert in. Well, I know I made a big fuss about it once, but... ...I don't think I would now. Well? You always misunderstood me, Jean... ...as you've misunderstood yourself. I tried to make a friend, a daughter out of you. But because you disliked me so much, you read into my every intention your own weakness, not mine. I am obviously improvident. I am certainly undistinguished. I am completely unlucky and unsuccessful, yes. But I am not unprincipled. My sins, I hope, will be only those of... of omission. Never again suggest such a thing to me. Or I will leave this house immediately. [laughing] Ooh... I certainly can't read men, can I? The ones I think are good, turn out to be bad. And the ones I think are bad, well... Help me up. Oh, Marino. Get away from me! And stay away! You pious liar. Go find what you're looking for someplace else! [laughs] Oh, don't worry. Don't worry, I'm going to. Every place else! [door slams] An old habit I picked up from you. - Just walking in. - Hi, Jean. - Hi. What are you serving? - Anything you'd like. Oh, that opens up some interesting possibilities. Anything you offer, I'll take. And don't restrict yourself to drinks. Jean, this is Serena. - Hello. - New protege? A new wife. We married last week in Tijuana. Honey, this is Jean Harlow. I recognized you. How do you do, Miss Harlow? Well, congratulations. - [Serena] Thank you. - Well, I guess I'd better be moving along. [Jack] Why? There's no need to. [Serena] We'd like you to stay. Well, I have some people waiting for me. Somewhere. - See you at the studio, Jack. - [Jack] Monday morning. Take care of yourself, Jean. [laughs] That's exactly what I had in mind. Something wrong with her? [sighs] There's something wrong with all of us, sweetheart. Just takes awhile for each of us to find out what it is. Good evening. Tell Mr. Manley Jean Harlow's here. Yes, Miss Harlow. Mr. Manley, I think I owe you something. Oh, I hope you saved room on your wall for my picture. Bedroom was to the left, as I remember. It still is. Then you shouldn't have any trouble finding it. What the hell is the matter with you? Nothing, nothing. It's one thing to have a reckless fling. But it's quite another when you make a way of life out of it. - My private life is my own. - When it's kept private. You realize what I've had to do to keep your name out of the scandal sheets? I don't do anything that millions of ordinary people don't do all the time! The day you became a star, you gave up your right to be ordinary! - Says who? - Says me! And the newspapers and Majestic Studios. And the millions of dollars they invest in you. So put the cork back in the bottle, stay out of hotels with strange men and stop making me ashamed of you! Listen, Arthur Landau, you work for me. I give the orders and you take them. I work for myself. I have many clients. You're just one of them. You hire my judgment. - Which I just gave you. - For a very pretty price, I might add. Oh... I told you once you'd resent the ten percent, didn't I? On the way up, they never do but on the way down, oh, they've gotta blame somebody and scream &quot;thief!&quot; Who says I'm on the way down? Here! Look at that face. Huh? The dark circles, the lines, the puffiness. Picture it a year from now playing second leads. And a year after that, boozy character parts! - And then, finally... - Oh, shut up! Shut up! - Oh, I wish I could fire you. - Go ahead. This town's full of guys who are willing to lie for a piece of your salary. Oh, Arthur, please, just go away and leave me alone. Can't I help you some way, please? No, no. Go away and leave me alone. I can't leave you alone! I don't know what you're liable to do next! Well, it's my life whatever I do. I've made you all wealthy. You all have homes and families and someone to love. Let me find what I need in my own way. Now go on, get out of here and leave me alone. [door slams] [sighs] Ohh! [sobbing] [horn honks] [woman laughs] [man laughing] Paper! Get your late evening paper! Paper, mister? Get your paper! Your late evening paper! Extra! Get your paper here! - [bell dings] - [car horn honks] [engine running] [waves crashing] [coughing] [car brakes squeal] [doors closing] [labored breathing] I... I tried to... [gasps] I tried to get somewhere. Somewhere. Everything I did... ...was further from you, from me. - Mama. - Baby. Mama. I'm gonna try to do better. I promise. I'm gonna... But they... they liked me, didn't they? Didn't they? They love you. They love you, as we all do. - Mama? - Hm? Baby. I promise... I'm gonna be a good girl. A good girl. Mama? Mama! - Something's happening! - Jean! Jean! Oh, dear... Please! Help her. Oh, baby. Jean? Don't. Don't. [sobbing] Jean! [shuts off oxygen] [sobbing] She's beyond help, Mrs. Bello... ...our help. She was only 26. Pneumonia's something we haven't conquered. She didn't die of pneumonia. She died of life. She gave it all to everyone else. And there wasn't enough left for her.
