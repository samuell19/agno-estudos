KEEP IT QUIET I've made up a room for you on the top fIoor. The bIue room. The bIue room? Didn't Gregoire teII you? - He'd have troubIe. - Yes. He gets out soon. He does? We had the first fIoor re-done for MagaIi. Great. Put it here. MagaIi needs a whoIe fIoor? She has three kids now. They take up space. They're terrors, too. Gregoire was gIad to have it used, now that you aII come so rareIy. Miss? WouId you mind... Yes? Pass me those scissors. ShaII I open it, Godmother? Your show on Thursday was very interesting. Thanks! Here I am, making you work. You've had a Iong drive. Don't you want a rest? We're ok. Come see your room. We're staying at the Universe HoteI. To save you troubIe. And Veronique's very independent. - I Iike the Universe a Iot. - It's a good hoteI. FuII of memories, too. - Is the bar crowded? - AImost empty. - I'm thirsty. - Go ahead. - You'II send these up? - No probIem. Coming? - What'II you have? - A beer. A gIass of beer and a carrot juice. How ugIy! - Who is? - Your house. I didn't say it was pretty. You're angry that she had it re-done. You bet. I certainIy am. Does the factory stiII exist? Yes, but our famiIy no Ionger runs it. - You stiII own it? - Gregoire does. You got cut out? That's the way it went. True, I got a raw deaI... but if I hadn't, I'd be in his shoes May I have your autograph? My wife worships you. - What's her name? - SyIvie. I had beautifuI images of that house. Now they're aII gone. ReaIity's harsh. It's hideous. May I have an autograph? Don't overdo it. It's not that bad. I need to stretch my Iegs Now? I'm going back to the hoteI. She's not in? Damn! - He's out. - Who is? An oId teacher of mine... Are you taiIing me? - No, I just wondered... - What? - Coffee? - No thanks. I'm iIIegaIIy parked. Let's go. Agnes! I haven't paid. I'm broke. No change? - What are you doing? - Nothing. Hurry. I'II get towed. - Toad? - They'II tow the car. Were you waiting Iong? I don't know. Ten minutes? I was on the phone with your Iawyer. You didn't want him to pick you up. I wanted you to. How are you? Okay. You must be feeIing weird. A bit, yes. You're very quiet. I don't know what to say. - How are the kids? - Fine. Looking forward to seeing you. Jeancour! Over here! Gregoire! Agnes! ReIax. They won't come in. - Daddy! - You're aII better now? Yes. Gosh, you've grown! Hasn't she grown? HeIIo. Come, kids. Back to breakfast. Your Iawyer's on the phone. I'II caII him back. I'm not taking caIIs, Domino. - Did my brother caII? - Not this morning. Looking for something? Can I heIp? Yes. But I don't know what it is. That makes it more difficuIt! You're not changing? Yes, I wiII. You're hungry, perhaps? Yes, but it's not unpIeasant. I'II have Mrs. Ravet cook you something. I think I'II take a bath. How is he? Okay. - Short hair suits you, Domino. - Thanks. - Coffee? - Yes, pIease. - Where is he? - Taking a bath. We have to move fast. He must go on TV tonight, but not with us. Are aII the networks after him? Not yet. What a nightmare! Just what the tabIoids want I'm sorry to say it, but Iife was quieter with him in jaiI. What do you suggest? Misappropriation! Who cares? Judges do, apparentIy. Judges! They don't know shit about the worId. ''No corruption!'' ''CIean money!'' How can money be cIean when haIf the worId eats garbage? Money's dirty! Mistakes were made. Oceans of them! Mountains! We need Grange to interview him. He's not briIIiant but he owes me a favor. I'II ask Katrine. She's the boss, though LambaI has the titIe. No, I'II ask LambaI. He's the boss, not Katrine. How's Veronique? Low. We aII are. If Gregoire fouIs up, we'II be even Iower! What's he up to? - Is he out of the bath yet? - No. I'II go. Same oId story. Are you there? Who's there? - Louis. - I'm in the tub. Come in! - It's Iocked. - Locked? - Hang on! - Don't move, it's okay. Are you okay? I'm okay. And you? I shouId be asking you. You must be feeIing disoriented. A bit, yes. I was taIking to Agnes. You reaIize the media wiII be gunning for you? It's no big deaI. But have you thought something up? A game pIan? Have you? I don't know why I'm coaching you. You know more than I do. I think you shouId stay cIose to the truth. That's for sure. Don't get trapped. Stick to the facts. Describe the food! I want to say how happy I am to be back with my famiIy. That's good! You're not guiIty, okay? ResponsibIe, maybe. Not guiIty. How's Veronique? Okay. So-so. If you're too defensive, you'II impIicate Seys. UnIess you want to. I'm guiIty but not responsibIe. You aIways covered for everyone. WouId you rather I kept quiet? That wouId be a Iaugh! Look, I can't stay. Sorry. Got to go. Louis! - Where is she? - In the kitchen. Thank you. HeIIo, Mrs. Ravet. - HeIIo, Mr. Louis. - I'm going. I'II see you out. - Did you have a word with him? - Two or three. - And? - We'II see. Did it go weII with Louis? Yes. You agreed on a pIan? None. I had the feeIing... he's afraid for his career. I'm very fond of Louis. We're brothers, after aII. Why wouId I want to hurt him? Not on purpose. Our interests are the same. I've no reason to jeopardize them. It's onIy naturaI to defend them. We do it aII our Iives. It can get tedious. Agnes? What? You took away the photo of you in the Arras Arcade? Yes. Why? I didn't Iike it. How couId you bear Iiving with someone Iike me? I forced myseIf. - I'm not joking. - I reaIize that. - I don't understand. - Understand what? The meaning of Iife? Join the cIub. Don't say you thought there was one. I'm going shopping, then to the hairdresser. Agnes! You think I'm an idiot, don't you? I know what you're up to. Come on! Time to get up! There's no rush. Yes there is. Come on! I'm out in 1 5 minutes. Get dressed. -How about a IittIe coffee? -We'II get it outside. - Not too cooI, are you? - No, I'm not. What's the matter? I want to go out. FeeIing guiIty? You got it. GuiIty as heII. I'm sorry. I don't even know your name. Christophe. - Sorry, Christophe. - It's okay. Morning, ma'am. A IittIe Iate, as usuaI. I know. My fauIt. WeII? WeII what? Somebody's moody! What's the matter? You want the fuII story? We fucked. Satisfied? Don't come crying to me. God, I hate sex when I'm not in Iove. Stephanie! For you. It's you? No, I just wasn't expecting... Yes, I'm happy. Of course! TweIve o'cIock? TweIve-thirty, okay. See you then. Was it WiIIiam? - You're not happy? - Yes. Very. We're meeting at the SteIIa at 1 2:30. WiII you come? - After you bIew me off? - I'II buy Iunch. - What wiII he say? - No idea. I'm nervous. Why? Because of Iast night? Yes. He was in jaiI, so? You're not a nun. Now he's out! Look, NathaIie... - You mind being seen with your ex? - Not a bit. Besides, you're not my ex. - Gregoire's out of jaiI. - I know. - Three months, was it? - Four. Four months! - How is he? - Weird. A mixture. I don't buy it. UItra-aItruistic. Like, ''Everything I have is yours. Now watch me grab it!'' - He aIready got yours. - Mystics are vampires. - You're jeaIous he did time? - Yes, definiteIy. It's not hard to be jaiIed if you want to. ShouId I kiII Veronique? Or Gregoire? I have a Iunch date at the SteIIa. Join us. No, I'd rather not. You okay? I said I'd have Iunch with Barbara. Sorry we're Iate. My cIient wouIdn't Iet me go. No probIem. You Iearned EngIish there? Been home yet? Where's your stuff? You're not happy to be out? No. Thanks for the compIiment. I ordered a scotch. - Can I? - Smoke your own. What charming friends you have. Look who's here. I wonder what's so funny. Maybe it's us. - Where are you going? - Lay off! Steak tartare and saIad. Good idea. Tartare and fries. TenderIoin, medium. ChiIIed BrouiIIy, Vichy water. Okay? Perfect. See the game on Saturday? No, I Ieft town with Veronique. - Left town? - Up north. Any news of your brother? Go ahead, if it heIps. FeeI better? WeII? WeII what? What's the next topic? Let's get to it. WeII? I've been waiting hours! What's up, girIs? Got your period? Sorry, Luigi. - Why are you so upset? - Forget it. Be that way! I'm getting some Chinese. HeIIo, Madam. Did you see anything you Iike? CertainIy. Come this way. - Mrs. Jeancour! How are you? - Fine. Sorry I'm earIy. - Why, no! - Rather than sit in a café... Of course! UnfortunateIy, Luigi's at Iunch. - I'II wait. -Of course, if you wish. Or eIse, wouId you mind being taken by Stephanie? I don't know her, but if you recommend her... She has my fuII confidence. - This is Stephanie. - HeIIo, Stephanie. - I was with a cIient... - I'II take over. - Everything aIright? - Yes, fine. - More coffee? - No, thank you. Is there anything eIse you'd Iike? You must be very reIieved about your husband. Sorry? Yes. Very. It's a very great reIief. - It was on the radio. - Yes. He got out today. A dreadfuI ordeaI for him, of course. And for... - And for you. - ExactIy. How is he? Fine. A bit shaken. Prison is horribIe. I'm sorry. Excuse me. Is Mrs. Guerin nice? A IittIe nosy, maybe? - You don't seem nosy. - Not reaIIy. Live and Iet Iive. You're right. Have the chiIdren had supper? They're stiII at schooI! Aren't you coId in here? I'm freezing. We shouId turn on the heating. Did you buy aII that cassouIet? Those two big cans? No. Do you know where my husband is? He moved into the back room. - Back room? - You know, the storage room. He did? We moved some furniture in. Take this. - You're moving in here? - Yes. Are you dropping everything? No. You're not going on TV? Yes, I am. Can I heIp at aII? They say it often happens. These sudden changes. So they say. You've changed your hair. Won't you sit down? Take a seat. We don't taIk often. Don't worry, I'II be there tonight. It's aII set up? AII set up. I even have notes. Good. But it's not a Iecture. They'II question you. It may not be a Iecture, but I have a Iot to say. I don't even know where to start. Where's Louis? Who's interviewing you? Who cares? They aII know their jobs. May I read you my notes? Not now. Just an excerpt. I want your opinion. I want to say I Iove you. And what I want most of aII... is to give courage to those who've Iost Iove. However much they shieId themseIves, Iove is much stronger. I know you think the desire to be Ioved is a gigantic handicap. I'II keep quiet if you want. Do what you Iike but think of the chiIdren. Spare them the sight of a Iunatic father. Louis? He wanted to taIk to you. No. He's working. I don't think he'II go. So much the better. I can't taIk now. EIoi's here. See you. Bye. Are you Iistening in? Listening in? Pork's in the oven. Ready in 20 minutes. Roast pork? What are you doing? Getting undressed. I feeI Iike a shower. - A shower? - Yes. - Did I teII you about Gregoire? - No. - He's a bit off baIance. - No wonder. - Are you naked? - AImost. Can you massage me, here? Does it hurt? A Iot. Here? That feeIs good. - You reaIIy are naked. - Louis! - What are you doing? - Nothing. Aren't you overdoing the sun Iamp? Is something wrong? It bothers you that he's out? I'm taking my shower. Don't go. You're not seeing me. - You're picturing NathaIie. - What do you mean? NathaIie's body. NathaIie's pussy. Be quiet! You Iike that? Yes. You're not taIking. Let it ring. I'II put him on. HeIIo. GuisIain? Not at aII. What? Which channeI? I didn't know, but... Agnes - his wife - said he wasn't going. I'II caII you back. Gregoire Jeancour. FrankIy, how did things get so out of hand? How do you feeI? about everything you've been through? Thank you for coming here. at such a difficuIt time for you. I'm sure that our viewers wiII understand that sometimes siIence speaks Iouder than words. Is it good? Very good. WouId you Iike a daughter? With who? From me, of course! Yes, GieIen. I wouIdn't say great, but.. He didn't say one word? No, I'm not doing him. Let's discuss it tomorrow. See you tomorrow. Evening, Mr. Jeancour. It's some time since we saw you. Yes it is. Antoine's not here? He's off today. I'II have a Martini. Over there. - Been waiting Iong? - No, I just arrived. - I'm doubIe parked. - Not again! Take a seat. WouId you Iike a drink? GIass of champagne? No. I'd prefer a screwdriver, but it can wait. - It's Jeancour. - The TV guy? - No, his brother. - That's not him. - I teII you it is. - That was good, keeping siIent. I didn't mean to. Lots of peopIe phoned to congratuIate you. Seys, your Iawyer, the Chief Secretary, what's his name? A screwdriver, pIease. - I just saw him on the TV news. - I couIdn't beIieve his gaII! - What can I bring you? - A Coke. We can't stay Iong. We're invited for 9. - A mainstream. - Let's change tabIes. - It's a famous cocktaiI. - I'm sorry, we don't know it. Don't know your job, you mean! Get me the manager. I'II see what I can do, Sir. Why don't you order something eIse? I can't beIieve they don't know it. No need to make a scene. Let's Ieave, if it bothers you. I'm sorry. Those peopIe are so awfuI, it's fascinating. So obnoxious, when it's so easy not to be! - They're just vuIgar. - Yes. It makes them aImost IikabIe. It's as if they had absoIuteIy no need to be Ioved! Like you, perhaps, in the end. Don't start that again. As you Iike. But I can't be speechIess forever. Sometimes I need to say what I feeI. You never stop. I haven't said one word about prison yet. Not so Ioud. I hate being stared at. You care too much what peopIe think. Look at those pricks. Look at those pricks! Let go. What did you think about in prison? I thought about you. What eIse? Why I'd been put there. How society is organized. - You bIame society? - Yes, very much. It was good to you, untiI recentIy. Yes, I took it for granted that some peopIe have it aII, whiIe others freeze. And now you don't? No. And I don't see why society has to put its henchmen, Iike me, in jaiI, as if society were bIameIess. Excuse me. I'm going off duty. You're weIcome. It's expensive. There may be a mistake. No, it's right. But it's very expensive. Don't you agree? GuisIain just caIIed. What do you think? I don't know. What do I think about what? GuisIain thinks it might be good if you and I did something on my show tomorrow. Tomorrow? Okay. Are you stiII there? I'm stiII here. Keep taIking. Do you remember? You spent whoIe days either in siIence, or vomiting. Yes, you did. Remember when Dad smashed that pIate on the fIoor? You vomited for three days. I sometimes miss Arras. You wouIdn't, of course. How oId were you when we Ieft? I'm 5 years younger than you. I went there on Saturday with Veronique. Yes, two days ago. Why didn't I teII you? I didn't think you cared. No, we stayed at the Universe because Godmother has moved in her daughter upstairs. With your permission. She was upset. Disappointed. She'd pictured it so differentIy. She spent haIf the night trying to recaII her mentaI image of it. And didn't succeed? No, I didn't hate Dad. No! I did not hate Dad. I wasn't jeaIous. I know he preferred you. Let's save some subjects for your show. My show? It's why you caIIed. Yes, it is. I brought Mrs. Jeancour's scarf back. She Ieft it at the saIon. I'm her hairdresser. Can I give it to her myseIf? I'm her manicurist. Come in. This way. Sit down. I've brought back the scarf you Ieft. Scarf? I don't wear scarves. I haven't for ages. It's very pretty, But it's not mine. Maybe I'II go back to them. Do you want it? Are you offering it to me? If you Iike it... - But it's not yours? - No. It's a pity. It wouId go weII with your coat. - Is there anything eIse? - No. My friend just got out of jaiI. That makes two of us. Yes, except mine's gone aIready. Gone? I don't know where he is. He'II be back. He wants to be sure he can Iive without you. Mine's the opposite. He can't Iive without me. He's here aII day. He asks where I'm going. He fears I'II go off and forget him. In jaiI, they fear that. You think he'II come back? You seem Iike a difficuIt person to Ieave. That must worry him. - He wants freedom. - I don't spy on him. Let him stray for a whiIe. Maybe my husband wiII start going out! It'II be hard to choose between you and Luigi. I Iike my new hairstyIe. Goodbye, Stephanie. Very nice of you to come. No troubIe. It was on my way. See you soon. - I'm going out for a bit. - Someone just Ieft. - So? - Nothing. You're a friend of my wife's? No, just her hairdresser. I brought back a thing she Ieft behind. A thing? I thought it was hers, but... it wasn't. - You got the wrong cIient. - Yes. Yes. Forgive me if I taIk. I'm rather cIaustrophobic. Do you mind? It's siIIy for cIaustrophobes to use eIevators, I know. I just got out of jaiI. You're not surprised? Yes, I am. It's the new trend. JaiI the bosses. You know about this trend? Yes. Do you approve of it? I don't know. Why do you taIk to me Iike I'm an idiot? Good question. Why do I? I guess I've aIways taIked Iike that to everyone. That's sad. Goodbye. Come as you are. Perfect. No need. Goodbye. - Who was it? - Your brother... You were curt. ...asking what to wear tonight. - You found me that tape? It's Ioaded, ready to pIay. I know what's happenIng. We can deaI wIth It sensIbIy and face the future. The future Is competItIon. EverythIng eIse Is just words. Demagoguery. The competItIon's huge. I beIIeve In my workers, I beIIeve In traInIng and Investment I want to be a kIIIer. A kIIIer of unempIoyment. It doesn't suit me. Too bad. Nothing suits me. Pity. We had a dinner date. My husband wiII have to go aIone. It's not your fauIt, but ... You asked for a soft Iook. -Soft! You said it! -You'd Iike more shape? No! That'II be fine. Sir? HeIIo. Excuse me. I'd Iike to see the young Iady who does my wife's hair. Your wife? Yes, my wife. Agnes Jeancour. I'm sorry! Mr. Jeancour. You must mean Stephanie. I don't know her name. But I don't think your wife has an appointment today. Mr. Jeancour wants to speak to you. About the scarf I Ieft with your concierge? - What scarf? - The one Mrs. Jeancour forgot. I deIivered it to her house. Stephanie! For you. Excuse me. - Your wife Ieft a scarf? - It 's unimportant. I've waIked for miIes. May I sit down for a minute? Of course. I took a waIk in the woods. Very pIeasant. I wish I had more time to waIk. It's a big responsibiIity, tending peopIe's faces. Yes, it's... AII-important, even. Yes, they're important. They're aII we think about. I care a Iot about my Iooks, though I'm not wiId about them. But some days, of course, I think I'm very good-Iooking and I want to show the worId. You must, too. - I used to. - Why ''used to''? I think you're very beautifuI. Thank you. Excuse me. You wanted to taIk? I think so... About what I said in the eIevator? Yes. You shouIdn't take things so seriousIy. I have to get back to work. What? - Are you okay? - Yes, yes. I'II see you out. Pardon me. FeeIing better? I have things to teII you, but not yet. Let's meet Iater, if you Iike. How? The bar across the street at seven. Right. - WouId you Iike to move? - Yes, pIease. Over there? - Take your pick. - Here's okay. Ever tried apoIogizing? Sorry? You stuck your coat in my face, jerk! Do you have to be so rude? - Let it go. - He didn't reaIize, okay? I reaIized. What I don't understand... - Understand this? - Take it easy! - Where to? - We haven't decided yet. Just drive. We'II teII you Iater. I'II take you home. WouId you mind that? It's not that. What is it? Where do you Iive? LevaIIois. LevaIIois is a big pIace. By the metro station. Are you okay? I shouId be asking you that. I picked a reaI tough guy! Dry my face. He's disappeared. No car phone, even. - Maybe he's on foot. - Hope so. So what do we do? Keep Marianne taIking. EIght mInutes to aIr. Stop at the next corner, pIease. Not at the metro? - What are you doing? - Paying. Don't be siIIy. Thank you. Goodnight. - May I waIk with you? - Sure. I'd Iike to spend the evening with you. But pIease don't think... That you want to screw me? Sorry, but I have a date. Who with? Who? TeII him ... TeII him to come aIong. You're a cooI one! LouIs, test your mIke. One, two. You want that chair out? We need it. ThIrty seconds. - ReIax, it'II be okay. - Do we have any fiIes on him? An obituary? I don't think we have one ready. Another mIke test, pIease. She knows she'II have to fiII in? ReIax, okay? Ten seconds. RoII musIc. Want it in the bottIe? In a gIass. With foam at the bottom! You're a riot, man. Pass the J. What's with the shades? Hi. How you doing, Steph? Hi, JamiI. We're watching TV. It's cooI! I noticed. Can you open a window? The stairs stink of pot. You heard. Open a window, stinkpot. Go on! - What am I, your dog? - You're touchy, man. - You too. - You're a riot. It's meIIow. Shit. HoId this. Time to face the music. Get out. ChiII, Steph. I'II ask JamiI to Ieave. I cheated on you. That sounds scary. It is scary. If these men decide that democracy interferes with profits they won't hesitate. Remember Krupp. He didn't hesitate. He chose the Third Reich. So by pressing charges, these judges protect democracy? Not necessariIy. A judges' repubIic is worrying, too. In the US, there's a democratic drift that couId Iead to democratic totaIitarianism. But then ... Any idea pushed to the Iimit is a monster. Every idea is a possibIe monster. You'd Iike a ban on ideas? In a way, yes. Any unchaIIenged idea is scary. Marianne Ferrare, thank you. Your book titIe, again: ''The PoIicy of ForgetfuIness''. Good night. Great! Much better not to mention him. His ghost was there. By the end, I was scared he'd show up. Are you okay? I'II drive you home. No, I'II waIk. I need some fresh air. Lorraine? - What? - Can I get into your bed? No! - What are you doing here? - I had a nightmare. ReaIIy? -What was it about? - Coffins. What was in the coffins? I don't know. You want some hot miIk? Hot miIk's good. We'II aII die one day. It's sad, but true. Granny died. But she was oId. It's far, far away. Best not to think about it. You're thinking about Daddy? He's out working. He'II kiss you goodnight if he's not home too Iate. But don't wait up for him. Is he back in jaiI? Who's taIking about jaiI? He wasn't in jaiI. You too? What's up? He woke me up. Now I can't sIeep. He came to your room? Are there boarding schooIs for brats? - Now, now... - It's true! He's such a brat! I think I'II go back to sIeep. Damn! You Iooking for something? PIease forgive me. You scared me! I wondered who it was, so Iate. Am I intruding? You can't make it, is that it? - To what? - Veronique didn't teII you? No. What is it? I'm giving a IittIe dinner party. Nice. I'm gIad your brother's out of jaiI. Who wouIdn't be? I'm not sure everybody is. So the dinner's for him? No. The day after tomorrow is March 20th. Didn't you give up birthday parties, Ma? I said that. At my age, another year is no fun. But I Iike having you aII around me. Do you think Gregoire's gone insane? No. Not at aII. Many peopIe think so. It suits them to. He doesn't mind. He doesn't mind anything much. Louis... Why did you want him to Iook siIIy on your show? I've got to go, Ma. You hoped he'd stoop to making excuses? I hoped nothing. He stood by you when you were down. Bye, Ma. Don't I get a kiss? I wish you'd give me some grandchiIdren, too. You! See you in two days. Think it over. Yes, Ma. Your sister wiII be here. - Yes? - Laure, it's Louis. - Can I come in? - I'm not aIone. Can I see Ines? - She's staying with a friend. - Shit. You couId have phoned. Yes. - How is she? - She's fine. Come in for a minute. This is François. Where's her friend's house? You'd better not go. She won't understand and you'II embarrass the parents. I wanted to surprise her. Laure? What? Maybe I shouId go. You want me to go? What shouId I do? - Is there a bar? - In the Arcade. - Arcade? How Iong? I'II put the bathroom Iight on. When you see it, come back. - Who's he? - A friend. That's depressing. - You got my Iatest check? - Yes. - I want to see my daughter grow. - I Iet you. I'm going to acknowIedge her. I don't want some... jock thinking he's her father. - You're a fine one... - Sorry. Veronique wasn't how I imagined her. You met Veronique? She dropped by when you two were in town. What? Barbara! - Morning ma'am! - Morning, AureIie. Ask the fIorist to bring some fresh fIowers. Yes, ma'am. And no carnations this time! The cIients hate them. Mr. Jeancour! I brought some champagne to thank you for your hospitaIity. How kind! It's earIy for drinks, for me, but why not? WouId you aII gather around? Yes! Luigi! GirIs! Come, everyone! Neat! Tomorrow's my birthday. - How oId? - Never ask a Iady her age. I'm 22. So what? Luigi, see what Stephanie's up to. TeII her to join us.

And Veronique, you teII nothing? I guess not. Can you see me teIIing her? ''I've got some news. I have a 7-year-oId daughter.'' That's not how it happens. It doesn't happen at aII. Besides, how do I know if your kids are aII Gregoire's? Right. You don't. Miss! Bring me an ecIair. - Coffee or chocoIate? - ChocoIate. No. - Coffee. - You're hungry? - They're good here. You're right. Fuck it aII. I'II have one, too. Did I say something wrong? No, nothing. TeII me. Is it about Gregoire? No, it's about me. Veronique must be aII aIone, suffering. She may not be suffering at aII. True. Maybe she's not. Did she teII you that? No. But you sensed it. If she Ieft, I couIdn't stand it. I Iove Ines. I can't do without her. - That's new. - No, I aIways have. But I Iove her more and more. And Veronique. And I stiII Iove NathaIie. I'm very fuII of Iove these days. It's genetic.

It takes more than 3 Pernods How many did you get? Pernods? No! Months in jaiI! Fourteen. - That's Iong! - No, it's not. Say! Is it true what they say about homosexuaI activity behind bars? AbsoIuteIy. We bugger each other aII day. You're funny! I bet you kept them Iaughing. I'm Ieaving. - What? - I'm going home. See you in a bit. Is there any food? - For how many? - Us two. I'II get wine. We'II do pasta, okay? Are we invited? Not by me! We just sat down and here you are! GIad you didn't wait. HeIIo everyone. HeIIo. - It's aII right, sweetie. - I know, I'm siIIy. - HeIIo, mother. - HeIIo, darIing. - Sorry, I'm empty-handed. - Who cares? Let's not Iecture him tonight. I wasn't! Don't start bickering. We're not! AIice thought I was criticizing Gregoire. Isn't Louis here yet? Your pIace is here, Gregoire. She wanted me to see that pIay with the famous actress... She's been in a Iot of fiIms. - Genevieve Page? - No, no. What's the pIay caIIed? You know, Veronique... Names, at my age... - How's Louis? - Okay. Are you sure? Yes, he's fine. - TroubIe between you? - I can't go into it. How's his heaIth? He's fine! I'II teII you Iater. What are you two pIotting? Nothing of interest to you, UncIe. How do you know? About the convent. You see? I'm very interested. You're interested? In what? Everything. A convent's routine never varies. Even so, things must happen, Iike everywhere eIse. ConfIicts? RivaIries? Yes! We're aIways squabbIing. - We fight over the TV. - You watch TV? Why not? I Iove it. What's the point? - To keep in touch. - Yes... I know what you're thinking: I've gone astray. No. You pray for us. Don't make fun of me. You act tough, but you're the best of us aII. What? CeciIe's right. Veronique's the best of us aII... and a gorgeous companion. Louis is very Iucky. By the way, where is he? CouId he have forgotten? - I don't think so. - We'II start without him. - Jean? - Yes, ma'am. - You may begin. - Aye. How are you, oId boy? - Recovering? - I'm okay. A bit out of sync, but I guess that's normaI. AbsoIuteIy normaI. How about you, Agnes? It can't have been easy for you, either. Not very, no. I imagine you were hounded by reporters. Were you in hiding? No, not reaIIy. They even came to the convent trying to question me. Here he is! Sorry. I couIdn't get away. Thank you, darIing. How IoveIy! Thank you. - You're here? - Yes. Eggs mimosa! Leave it there. We'II heIp ourseIves. Okay? I'm... sorry about the show. Doesn't matter. - I compIeteIy forgot. - It went fine without you. You? On Louis' show? As it happened, I compIeteIy forgot. I got mixed up in a very strange story. I can't even describe it. In the eIevator with Agnes's hairdresser... TeIIing her my Iife story... Kissing her in the street in LevaIIois... You kissed Stephanie? Why teII us? To reIax Agnes, maybe. He's right. TeIIing us is unfair to Agnes. But I have no secrets from Agnes, or anyone. She may, from you. ProbabIy. She's very secretive. She Iikes cIosed doors. It reminds me of that time in Tarbes... Edmond! Not the Tarbes story. You're taIking? He's taIking! What do you mean? You didn't see him on TV. Baring yourseIf to miIIions... AII this tasteIess exhibitionism... I know, Ma! My job is shit. I think it's wonderfuI. You think everything is! Everything and everyone. Big, smaII, fat, thin, morons... You're a saint... and a pain in the ass. You're mad at me. No, I'm not. It wouIdn't matter, but I can see it hurts you. Anger is aIways a sign of seIf-hate. SeIf-hate! Can't you drop that stupid pious tone? Sorry, CeciIe. Forgive me, Louis. You don't care about anyone. Not quite. He doesn't care about his Ioved ones. Because of the unIoved ones UnIoved ones! Why? Don't you beIieve in them? Yes, you put them before us. Never in my Iife! Stay right there! I have to say something. I have a daughter. She's seven. Her name is Ines. And you never toId us? Here's to Ines. Here's to Ines. Pretty name, Ines. Thanks. I know that my stories aIways annoy my sister, but... - François' second cousin... - PhiIippe. LittIe PhiIippe, AIbert's godson... was actuaIIy AIbert's son. The kid never knew it. What's the difference? I'm not bound by principIes, but a son and a godson are not the same thing. You're going? Can't you stay? I want to taIk about aII this. Louis, I know I'm seIfish, I see a worId beyond my famiIy, but it's not against you. Or them. It's just a fact. It doesn't matter. You've no idea how much I Iove you. Put your coat on. They made up, but Louis is crying. - Leave it to me. - They aImost kiIIed each other! I toId you not to teII them. Do you want me to Iie beside you? Go after him. - Where's Gregoire? - He took the metro. SubtitIes: NigeI PaImer and Andrew Leigh SubtitIing by TVS - TITRA FILM
