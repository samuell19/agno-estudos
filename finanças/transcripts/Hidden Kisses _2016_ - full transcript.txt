Don't drop me right in front of the house. Okay! Am I well-dressed? It's alright for a nerds party. Okay. I won't go then... I was kidding, you're handsome, Sir! I don't know anyone... It's hard to change school in the middle of the year but it's a good start! You've already been invited to a party. Have you spotted any girls? You've spotted girls! I'm reassured, I'm not the only one late! See you this evening! - Good evening, Chief. - Good evening. - Good evening, how are you? - Fine, thank you. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Okay... Good evening, Chief. Goodbye, Sir. - Guess what? - What? Here's a clue: noise complaint. The party? Yes, they assigned it to us. What shall we do? Let's wait until they call again. Can you imagine Nathan's and Chloe's reaction if we went there? I'd like to know what's happening at that party. What are you doing? Browsing Chloe's profile. My daughter and I have a deal. I have her password in case of a problem. You're being curious now... They're having fun... Wait, go back... Is that Nathan? That's a boy! He's kissing a guy! Hey dad! How's it going? Chloe's mother showed me a picture from the party on her daughter's blog. - What's that picture about? - What picture? The picture where you're kissing a guy. Oh. Nothing. Just a buddy. We were drunk and we wanted to make the girls laugh a little. - Did they find it funny? - Yeah. We had an agreement. I let you do anything except drink alcohol! We agreed on that! Well. Let's forget that now, alright? Get ready... It's a nightmare! Don't worry, I promise. There's no way you'll be recognized. I need to see you this afternoon. Why? Only for five minutes, I need to give you your scarf back. I'll call you back. Nathan! Nathan! Do you know them? Kind of... I know them from school. They're pretty! They're alright. Go see them if you like. It's okay. Shall we go? What a shame! They must be looking at that picture. Go tell them it was a joke! I don't care. Come on. They're making fun of you. Tell them! If you don't tell them, then I will! Dad! Stop it! I don't understand. - It doesn't bother you that...? - It wasn't a joke! It wasn't a joke when I kissed that guy! I need to go. You're already leaving while it's getting good! I know, but I'm exhausted. What do you want? Look at the picture from the party! Good morning! Yes, its the new guy from the 10th grade! He kissed a guy! That's the new guy, look! Wait... Let me see! Go to your classes! Good morning! Everybody in! Could we quietly start class for once?! Nathan! Alright! Shall we start? Well today, we'll see how to graphically represent a function. I'm sorry. Posting that picture on my wall was stupid. - Do you know who took it? - Nobody knows... Who's the guy you kissed? I bet it was Julien. Was it him? You don't care about what I'm saying? The graphical representation of a function is the set of points... Come on admit it. It's Julien I don't remember. - Come on, I won't tell anybody! - I can't remember! Enough Nathan! Don't you think you've attracted enough attention? I don't understand why Julien isn't admitting! I can understand it. If I were gay, I would kill myself! You would be able to tell if Lucas were a faggot! I think it's obvious! Have you ever seen him with a girl? You haven't had any girl either! Don't say that! - Don't touch me! - Don't say that! I'm not a faggot! I'll kick your ass! I'm not touching you! He said I'm a faggot. I'm not the one who's gay! Lucas is! - Don't grab me again. - You're crazy! You and your friend Lucas are crazy! I saw them staring at each other at that party! There's something between them! It must be Lucas who kissed him! And he's saying I'm a faggot... He's insane! What's going on?! Are you out of your mind? Stop it! Sit down! Go sit down, Lucas! Who wrote this? Do you want to go to the nurse's office, Nathan? I'm fine. Actually, I'd like to go. Go ahead. I know what's going on here. Everyone's talking about that picture here. But nothing justifies your behavior, Lucas! I'm being accused, so I'm defending myself. The other guy should admit, right Julien? Just because I don't want to date you doesn't mean I'm a faggot! Are you aware of the words you're using? "Accused"... "Admit"... As if you're dealing with a crime! It's like "faggot". It's an insult! What are you talking about? It's not an insult, it's a regular word. We just use it to make fun of someone! Words have meanings! They can be very harsh! But Sir, He chose to be that way, he should accept it! Oh, you think it's a choice? So you chose to be attracted to girls? No. I didn't choose that. It's because they're attracted to me! May I ask you a question, Sir? Yes. Is it true that you're into men? What makes you think so? I don't know... You're defending the gays. And your style is a bit... Never mind... Go ahead what is it about my style? She must mean you lack some masculinity. Alright. Let's be serious for a moment and we'll discover the other prince of the English elegance... Oscar Wilde. It's Nathan. I'm waiting for you. There's nobody here... I'm waiting for you... Call me back. Have you heard about his son? Yeah. I don't want to be in his shoes! Did you tell them? I didn't say anything! What's the problem? You've been avoiding me. I just don't like to talk at work. Stéphane, we're going for a drink. Are you in? - Not now, I'm tired. - As you wish. If you change your mind you know where to find us. Hey dad, I'm in front of you workplace. I was thinking we could go home together. Call me back if you get this message. I still have work to do. Don't wait for me. You should learn irregular verbs. Same for you. - May I see you for a minute? - Sure. We'll talk about it later. - Please. - Thank you. You know me, Tristan. I'm not the kind of principal who interferes in classes. I've received calls from parents who didn't really appreciate the fact that you talked about homosexuality during a class. I didn't talk about homosexuality, I... I dealt with homophobia. My job is to allow pupils to overcome their prejudices... No, your job is to teach English. Nothing more. Then we should invite an association fighting against homophobia to take action here. Pupils have a lot of questions and... Is this a joke? Can you imagine the mayhem such an association would cause here? Listen Tristan I have nothing against gays, I even have many homosexual friends, so you can behave the way you want outside, but here you're a simple teacher, is that clear? Great, thank you. Why didn't you tell him you have a wife? Let him believe what he wants. I was with the 10th grade students. There was another name on the board. Nathan got overwhelmed! A fight started. Whose name was it? - Marco. - Marco? I don't think it was him! Really? What do you mean? Do you realize what you're saying? Relax Tristan. It's just a hunch. I can't believe we can't help that kid! It's his fault. He should have been discreet. What? What about you, Catherine? I think that in order to work peacefully, I should go elsewhere. Wait Catherine! Wait Catherine! I know what you want from me. The answer is no! It would be nice if you talked to Nathan. I knew it. So once again: no! Alright? It would he helpful if you talked to him. How stubborn are you! I pity your wife! You would know what to say, you know what he's going through! I'm his Math teacher. I just know about equations and geometry. Those are my only skills! The other day, you told me that you would never, ever want to relive your teenage years. Remember that? Things could have been easier for you if a homosexual teacher had told you you weren't alone! Do you realize what you're asking me to do? What are you afraid of? That people find out you're a lesbian? So what? Things have changed! I can't believe it! Do you straight people think we're paranoid? That we see homophobia everywhere? What do you think? That everything is fine because of a law about marriage? If you knew what I hear during recess, in the classroom or even in the teacher's room. You were there, right? It would be Nathan's fault because he "hasn't been discreet"? - Catherine... - No, you listen to me! When I was a teenager, school was hell! I'm still at school. Teaching math is the only thing I can do. My family barely speaks to me. I've been really lonely. I held on thanks of this job. And aside from close friends like you, I don't tell anyone about my private life! I'm 50 and because I have 140 students looking at me and 280 parents are holding me accountable. I just want people to leave me alone! - And Nathan? - He'll do what I did... He'll suffer and then he'll get over it. Yeah, it's me again. I'm tired of your voicemail. Can we a least talk? Please call me back. Hello... We've gone to the wrong floor. YOU FAGGOT Turn the volume down... Why don't you say who's the other boy? I don't remember who it was. I was drunk. Don't take me for an idiot. He's threatening you, right? He doesn't want to talk about it and I don't want to betray him! Right, but in the meantime, you're the only one suffering! It's hell at school and my father yells at me when I come home. But I don't care. You know why? Because I'm in love. - What are you up to? - I'm just telling the truth. You can't fall in love at your age. Really? You told me you were crazy in love with a girl in 10th grade! This is... It's different. This thing with that boy isn't serious... I'm gay! You'll have to accept it I'm your only son It's not easy to have a son like you. It's not easier to have a homophobic bastard as a father! I knew it was him! It doesn't make sense, I spent the evening with my boyfriend! Enough for now! I swear I'll get you! Stop! Another word and I'll give you a test right away! Alright, Madam... Do you remember everything? We need to act quickly. That way, it'll be easy work for the CID. Let's get ready. Patricia can we talk? - I'm sorry for... - You've become paranoid! A couple of colleagues gossip, so you think everyone's a jerk. What are you thinking? That I perceive you differently because of Nathan? - I don't know... - It's okay, it's fine.. No need to tell me that if my daughter had kissed another girl, I would feel bad. That's true, thanks... It was unexpected... We were like best friends, and then everything changed. I don't know what I did, that made him keep it a secret. What's wrong with me? I never thought I'd take it this way... I thought I was open-minded... No... We had each other's back. When his mother died Nathan told me: "Don't worry, dad we'll get through this..." Now, it's like we're strangers. He's still your son... Why are you always calling me? I'm not the one who wrote that on the hoard. I know it wasn't you. It was someone who wanted to mess things up. There was no need to make me come here to tell me this. That's not the reason why... I wanted to see you, Louis. I'm feeling lonely. I see you in the classroom but I can't even... I'm not like you. That kiss was only a try. I see... Did you bring my scarf? I'd like to keep it. I'm not the only one who knows it was you. The one who took the picture knows as well. Whom are you texting? My mother. She wants to know at what time I'll be home. Shall we dance? Go ahead. I don't want to dance. What do you want? Follow me. I'm scared too... Is anybody here? Let's swim? Go ahead if you want. Come on... It's practice time, Louis. Nice footwork! Come on! - Did I hurt you? - It's fine. Are you okay? - Do you want to win that match? - Definitely. You need to work on your weaknesses if you want to win. Come on! Good. You see. It's all in the mind. Good. Well done. Very good. So he told me: "Can I have the balance sheet for Monday?" My weekend is ruined now. How was your day? Back pains all day long... It's good to be a doctor... Eat Theo, be nice... I bumped into Laura's mother... - We talked about the young lovers... - Come on... You're in love, right? - We're not married... - You seem to be well on your way... Even though I'm not in a rush to become a grandmother. She also told me about a new boy in your school called Nathan. - She told me he is gay. - What does "gay" mean? Eat your tomatoes. - For the parents... - It can't be easy. Have you already talked to him? No... I mean, I've just said hello. Keep your distance. Like on a ring. You didn't expect that one. - No worries. - "No worries, no worries"... That's all I hear. Pass the ball. There you go. Yellow team, it's your turn! Pass the ball, Marco... Pass the ball! What's wrong with you? I don't touch faggots! Don't touch me! What have I done to you? Don't touch me! Stop it! What's going on? Don't touch me! Take a two minutes break! Calm down! Are you okay? Let's go! Look at this! This is a scar! I was bitten by a dog when I was young. Stop it, you're turning Nathan on! Aren't you ashamed? The girls locker room is over there! He'd rather stay here to watch! Come on, keep watching! Stop it! Stop it! Nathan, is that you? Nathan! Nathan! Hi, it's Nathan. Please leave a message. Nathan, I got a call from school they told me you weren't in class today. I'm not angry. I just want to know where you are. Call me back, please. Can you hear me? - Gentlemen. - Please. What's going on? One of them ran away. This one has been stabbed. - His identity? - He has no ID on him. This is Tango 2... Rue des Bordes. One man injured. Send an ambulance. Inform the CID as well. Copy that, thank you. That bastard made me run. He threw this away. You go back with Marc... - I'll stay here with Patrica. - Alright. Hi, it's Nathan. Please leave a message. Nathan! Nathan! Nathan! Nathan! What happened? Let me see! Le me see, Nathan! What happened? Talk to me. Talk to me, I'm here. Talk to me... They hit me, dad. Including him... Including him... Relax, I'm here now... I'm here... I'm here... I'm here... I'm the one who took the picture. Why would you do that? I wanted you to react. But I didn't think things would go this far. - Are you in love with him? - No! So why did you kiss him? I didn't. He wanted that. He's been hitting on me since he arrived at school. He kept following me at that party. The only way of getting rid of him was to kiss him. So I did. But I'm no gay. I don't care about that guy. You're the one I love. I believe you. Laura, will you stay for dinner? Stay, I'd love it. How's Nathan? He really wanted to go to school this morning. He told me if he didn't, he would never go back there otherwise. What are you going to do? I don't know. He doesn't want me to get involved. If you had seen what they did to him... A father who doesn't protect his son is not a father. Good morning. Is this for me? We've been together for a year. We should celebrate that. What's going on? You're quiet today! Nathan, what happened to you? He fell down, Madam. Nathan... what happened to you? I fell down. Now, we're going... to finish working on... Now, we're going... to finish working on probabilities. No, I'm not going to tell you about probabilities. I'm going to tell you about a girl... That girl always went to high school with a horrible fear... She would make detours to avoid the ones who would make fun of her. Because... She preferred girls to boys... That girl would have been less ashamed of herself if she had the chance to know someone like Nathan. Someone as brave as him, who dares to say he's different. You need courage in order to stay true to yourself... and to look other people in the eyes. What's the courage of those who have beaten Nathan up? - Madam? - Yes? That girl you talked about, was that you? How would you calculate the probability that it would be me? I don't know... When you flip a coin, you can either get heads or tails. We say that the probability to get heads or tails is a half. Getting heads or getting tails, is an outcome. Aren't you going to lunch? When I was your age, I spent hours alone in the classroom. Sometimes, I feel like I have that feeling again. I wish you will never have to go through that, Nathan. You're the one who's right. - Are you alright, Catherine? - I'm fine thank you. Kiss me. Kiss me. Look at that! Come on, stop it! Get out of here, there's nothing to see! What's going on with you? Times are changing... I'm not afraid... What if I kissed you right now, in front of everybody? - What? - What about that? - You're crazy, stop it! - Kiss me now... - Stop it! - Come on, kiss me! - Why are you touching me? - Kiss me! Stop it! Stop it! There are people here! - You're afraid! - Leave me alone! Get lost! I pity you, Louis. I realty pity you... What are you doing here? Get lost! Do you think you're scaring me? You're not scaring me! You're not scaring me either! I'll take you all on, one by one! The faggot isn't scared! What's going on? You're so quiet now! Am I shocking you? It's because there are people around! You're afraid to look like assholes, right? Right? It's easy to beat someone up when there's nobody around! But now... In front of everybody... Come on! Come on! Come on! You worthless pieces of shit! Nathan! Hi... - You were here... - Yes. "I can take you on, one by one"? I didn't know what to say. Let's go. Hi, it's Nathan. Please leave a message. Hi, it's Louis. Call me back, please. My parents are coming for lunch tomorrow, It's the only moment of the weekend when we're alone. And you're working?! I have a balance sheet to deliver on Monday! Oh no! Shit! It froze again! I don't understand! I can't get that sheet back. Use Louis' computer. No way. He hates it when we go in his room. He's not here. - Do you know his password? - No... Try "boxing" or "Laura"... - Do you know what's mine? - No. My woman's name! I wasn't talking about you... It was just out of curiosity! Everyone's been talking about it since Nathan came! I visited some forums just to get some info! That's it! What about gay porn websites? Is that also out of curiosity? - I just visited one! - You're lying, Louis! We've checked your history. I don't understand. What about Laura? I'm talking to you! Louis! I know that these associations are allowed to take action. But let me remind you that it's up to me to decide to invite them or not in my institution! And as I already told you I'm totally against that! That's not because of personal conviction. You know the parents won't hesitate to oppose that! If Nathan has been beaten up, it's also our fault because we didn't do anything! We can't dismiss this as a one off, Just because we don't want to upset parents. We're planning on launching a petition. Out of the 53 teachers who work here, 47 told us they supported having one of these associations here and they were ready to sign it. And a large majority of the parents would sign it as well. Sounds nice, but you're not the ones who will have to talk to parents. What should I tell them when we'll be accused of proselytizing Tell them to look for the definition of proselytism in a dictionary... So they won't use that word incorrectly. Homosexuality is not a doctrine... or a philosophy... It's not a life choice. Put your gloves on! Don't you want to have a family? I mean a regular family! Do you want to be miserable all your life?! Do you? Living on the edge of society. I'm lost, dad. "I'm lost, dad"... You know why?! Do you know? Do you? Because in your small head, you know you're going the wrong way! It's not inevitable! Don't let yourself be controlled by this shit! This shit will go away! I've tried, dad... I swear I've tried. "I've tried"? You've tried?! Look at me when I talk to you! Put your gloves on! Put your gloves on! Get ready! Defend yourself! Come on! Come on, hit me! Is that all you got?! Come on! Come on! Get up! You've tried?! You've tried?! Face me! Come on! Punch! Come on! That's how you do it! Come on! Do you want to win that fucking match? Are you going to win it! Get up! Get up! You've tried?! You still need to try! No more phone! No more internet! You agree on that, right? He needs to stay here. We need to solve this. He has to go back to school. I'll write a sick note for him, he can be sick for some days. And it's not completely a lie after all... Do you think it's the solution? You want him to stay this way?! No. Then you need to stop protecting him like that! We can't let him ruin his life! We need to show him he's wrong. He needs some time to realize it, just a bit of time... I'm sorry... Hey... Do you trust me? Yes, I trust you. I'll get that. - Hello. - Hello Laura. I'm here to see Louis because he's not answering my messages. I was concerned. It's fine, he's in bed and he's got a high fever. He's got an acute angina. Can I see him? Do you want to get sick too? Don't worry, your darling will get better soon. - I'll tell him you came by. - Thank you, goodbye. I'm coming! Did you think I had forgotten? 16 years old! We should celebrate that, right Awesome! Great! Blow them out or we'll eat the candles! Blow them out! If there's anyone, I mean... You can have the flat to yourself this weekend and invite some friends. It's okay... Is that Louis? You'll have to sort things out with him someday... I don't care about that guy. I'm not gay... I'm not gay... But dad... What? Come on! - Are you sure? - Yes, I am! This is my son Nathan... Hi Nathan, I'm Serge... I'm Marc. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you too. Well, have a seat, welcome home. It's a bit like our home here. So, are you studying? - I'm in 10th grade. - Really? I have a piece of advice, keep studying, otherwise you might end up like us! It's not so bad! You had a Gothic phase when you were a teenager. Well, the same thing goes for me. I just wanted to provoke you. None of this is true. I'm not gay. It was stupid, I know. I know I hurt both of you. What about Laura? I understand all of that thanks to her. What's going on? It was only provocation. It wasn't true. I'm really sorry... Let him call Laura. Have you used your phone? - No... - No? Are you sure? I just wanted to call Laura. Nathan... Nathan... Nathan... And of course no Laura... You can get your phone and your computer back. You can go out, see whoever you want. But don't ever talk to us again! Lying to us? Are you treating us as if we're enemies? From now on, we're ignoring you! Eat Theo! - I don't like this. - Eat! - Where are you going? - I'm getting the salad. Do I really have to eat alone every time? I didn't do anything wrong. I had to lie... He's insane... Please talk to me, mom... I'll change. I swear I'll change. But please talk to me... Mom, can I have water? You scared me! - Were you spying on me? - I thought you'd give in. I'm not sure I can keep this up, it's too hard! Do you think it's easy for me? We need to hold on, it's only a matter of time. - Are you okay? - Yes. Theo! Get out of here, Theo. I want a hug. Get out... Stay away from your brother. Theo! I'll tell you a nice story. Come on, leave me alone! You're dead to me now! What's going on? I'm leaving. I'll never go back home. Explain to me what happened! My parents have gone crazy, they hate me... Is it because of that picture? Answer me, is it because of the picture? Are you really gay? Is it my fault? Do you think I'm ugly? Maybe I'm a bad kisser? What should I do? I need money Laura. You need to lend me some money. - Dad! - What? I need your help! You really don't know where he could be? I have no idea! I need your help, focus! Have you heard anything? Did he tell you anything? - I think I heard a train... - A train? Are you sure about that? - Are you sure about that?! - I'm sure! Okay, let's go to the bridge. There's also the abandoned factory. We often meet there. Do you have a description? Blond, 16 years old. Regular height. Okay, I'll let you know. Let's go! Sorry! This is where we meet! He's up there! Stop! Louis! Don't do that! Leave me alone! Don't come any closer! Louis, I just want to talk to you! I have nothing to say to you! There are people who love you. Your little brother, your parents. You're wrong. I'm dead to my parents! They treat me like shit, they hate me! That's not true... Louis... Look at me... Louis... Look at me... Give me your hand... Give me your hand... Give me your hand... Yeah. I've never been so scared... See you tomorrow Serge, thank you. I'll take you home. I can't go back to my parents. You need to go home Louis. Can he stay with us tonight... He can go back home tomorrow. Here you go. There you go. Nathan... But I... It's getting late. We all need some rest. I'll come see you. Will you be okay, Louis? I'll be fine. If you need anything, talking... I'm in the next room, okay? Alright, thanks. I'm fine, don't worry. Try to get some sleep... Nathan... I can't sleep. Come in... I was eight years old. My grandparents used to come to our house. They were always looking at me in a weird way. I understood that I'd never be like the other boys. I didn't want my parents to be embarrassed because of me. I put pressure on myself. I became a paranoid. When I started going out with Laura, my parents felt reassured... And then you showed up... This is a new student. His name is Nathan, and I'm counting on you to welcome him. It was the first time I felt something like that... Let's continue the lesson about the author of "I have a dream"... I was really ashamed... More than ever. I thought you would've gotten rid of it. No... What are you doing? It's your smell! When I saw them together, in love, I had a weird feeling. I felt a bit dumb... I'm barely getting used to the idea, Nathan could have spared me! He could have taken it step by step. Slowly... Well. It's getting late, I'm leaving! I hope I didn't wake Chloe up... She's not here. She's with her father. Well... Stay here... - Good morning. - Good morning. - Are you leaving? - Yeah! - See you later then... - See you. How will we manage this at work? I don't know. - I don't care. - Yes! - Hi dad! - Good morning. You must have noticed that Louis was... Don't bother yourself. And... - Did you... - No. I knew I was going to deal with that matter with you. I'd even prepared a little talk for the occasion. Honestly, I thought it would be with a girl... And what would you have told me? I think I would have told you about my first experience... It was during high school... We were scared too! We took our time. So, the first time was magical because we were in love... This talk works in my case as well. Yeah I think so too! - Good morning. - Good morning. - Please, help yourself Louis. - Thank you, Sir. Call me Stéphane. - Stéphane? - Yeah. When are you going to call my parents? I already did. It was your mother. We had a talk. That must be her. She's picking you up. Yes? I'm Louis' father. Tell him I'm waiting for him outside. Just come up here! I'd rather not. Let my son come down here immediately! Where's Louis? Can we talk for a minute? There's no reason to do so. Where's my son? Did your wife tell you what he almost did last night? Listen, I know what you've done, I'm very grateful for that, but this is none of your business anymore, okay? Louis told me what's going on in your house. So what? You want to show me how to raise my son? No... I know how you're feeling, I was angry as well... If Louis still isn't here in a minute, you will regret it. Louis! I don't want your father to get into trouble. Are you really going back there? I'll be fine. I feel stronger now. Thank you for everything, Stéphane. I locked him up in his room. Do you realize what he tried to do last night? That's precisely why I locked him up. I'm just preventing him from trying again. Give me the key, I want to see him. Not now Corinne, that would make things worse. Are you insane? Give me the key! I have a few consultations at the office, I'll be back in two hours. We'll go and talk to him together, alright? Corinne, do you trust me? Do you trust me? Hello No, I'm on leave but I'm listening. Well... Yes, call him on my behalf... Wait, I have his number in my agenda... Can I call you back? - Louis - What? I'm going to smash the door in! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! - Hello. - Hello, is my husband here? No, he's in a consultation right now. Alright. Goodbye, Madam. What are you doing here? We need to talk. - Can't this wait? - No. What's going on? Have you left Louis by himself? I don't want you to keep mistreating him. Mistreating?! What are you talking about? I love my son too. I just want to protect him. He wanted to kill himself because he's gay, right? No, it's because we rejected him. Because we made him think he was abnormal. I'm feeling so guilty. And if Nathan and his father hadn't been there... Come on... Did that cop brain-wash you? We need to change, not him, do you understand? What are you talking about? I don't recognize you anymore... - Corinne - I'm leaving you. I'm leaving with the kids. I'm moving in with my parents. And let's make things clear: If you do anything to stop me, I'll file a complaint for mistreating. Think about your patients, about your reputation. - What's going on? - Nothing, let's go. How's your new school? I don't know, I'm starting tomorrow. I've read your email. You almost wrote a whole novel. I know, but I had to since you weren't answering my texts. You've hurt me, you know. I know... I'll come back for the boxing tournament. Yeah, great... Will you be there? I don't know... So, is it true? You think I'm pretty? Very pretty. Too bad I'm not bisexual! You jerk! Are you still there? I need to go, I'll call you back later. Wait, I wanted to tell you something. I had Corinne on the phone earlier... And? She found an apartment, they're coming this weekend. I know... Wait... Stop... One second... It's so annoying to have a physically diminished father! Diminished? Race to the car! What are you thinking about? I'm not sure I should have come... Are you mad at me? I guess it wasn't a smart question... You know... It wasn't against you. I mean... It wasn't meant to hurt you. I don't know what to say... I'm not mad at you. Feels weird, right? Do you love him? We weren't meant to be... He's here. I missed you. I'll never get over it! I do! I think they're lovely... - We're ready. - What shall we do? It's okay. Isn't Louis with you? No, he doesn't want to fight anymore... What's going on? Is there a problem? I don't want to fight anymore. I thought I was able to beat him... But I can't... What's the real reason? You're not the one who's supposed to be here... Whom are you boxing for, your father or yourself? It's alright if you don't want to go. You can go home and that's it. But no regrets. Okay So think quickly, because they're waiting... Could you help me put them on? Forget about all that now... Breathe, think about your fight. There you go. Okay? Let's go. So, no head butts. Have a good fight. Keep your guard up, Louis! End of the first round. What did I tell you? Keep your guard up! Are you listening? Come on, Louis! He's brave. Louis wins the second round... Did you see my guard? I really got better, right? Thanks to you... Will you celebrate this with us? Stay here, dad... Aren't you proud of me? Aren't you proud of me! He'll need more time. Come on, we're waiting for you...
