More than 2000 years ago, during the Warring States era, the mysterious Master Gui Guzi appeared. According to rumors, he had a military manual so potent that any vassal state that owns it would be able to dominate all under heaven. Master Gui Guzi transmitted this military manual to only one man, his last disciple, Sun Bin. Sub Bin followed his Master, Gui Guzi, and lived in seclusion in the mountain. When the entire world was engulfed in chaos, The King of Wei has a great thirst for talented people. Please, Sir, follow me and come to with the state of Wei. I, the King of Qin, respectfully invite Sir Sun to descend the mountain So that I can honor him as the National Advisor. I come from the state of Qi, as ordered by the king of Qi To respectfully invite Sir Sun to go down the mountain? THE WARRING STATES Translators: Blue Magic (Chinese to Vietnamese) April (Vietnamese to English) Director: Chen Jin So beautiful! The battlefield? The gleam in Ji Er's eye? Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill! Attack! Kill! Shoot the arrows! Everybody! Take cover quickly! The arrows are coming! The shooting is over. Hurry, let's go collect the arrows. Quickly! Don't pick up the arrows! They are still shooting. More arrows are coming! Take cover quickly! I saved your life. But this flute saved my life! Without it, I would be dead! Uncle, you saved my life I will give you food. What kind of food? We trade these arrows for food at the Wei military camps. My name is Little Doggie, what is your name, Uncle? Sun Bin. Come here, nephew. The general has ordered that, given that we are at war, we can't hand out food. Let's wait. We just want give you the arrows, we don't care about the food. We are going to collect more arrows now. and we will return shortly. Why are you so unreasonable? - Sun Bin This child almost lost his life. Who is Sun Bin? You are that General? A student of Sir Gui Guzi. They risked their lives collecting arrows to exchange for food. Impossible. I got the food. Here is your share. You saved our lives, Sir? My three thousand soldiers and officers? General, there is a woman over there. she is very beautiful. Her eyes, especially, are so big. So she was the one who beat you guy up like this? She is as ferocious as a wolf. Very interesting. Sir, do you have any suggestions for us? Not yet. I haven't been able to come up with one yet. Sorry. Which day is today? I have a suggestion! General, The Wei troops are carrying the bodies of our dead soldiers up the mountain. I don't know what they plan to do. What would be their intention? What is up there in the sky? There will be a solar eclipse tomorrow at noon, General, let's take advantage of this occasion. Order our troop to slide down the mountain and infiltrate the Qi troop's camp. The Qi soldiers will become disorganized and they won't be able to react on time. Then we can break the encirclement and remove the threat. Something is wrong! Reporting! General, The Wei army took advantage of the darkness and slipped down the mountain. They are coming after our rear guards! Send the archers to the back! Yes. Listen to the order! The enemies are here! Kill them all! Kill all the Qi soldiers! Wei soldiers have tied red string on their arms. Remove the string. Master of the House? Master?of the...House! Hurry, run! Sun Bin, don't run. Stop. Stop, Sun Bin! Don't run. Don't chase me, or I will jump down! Shoot! Senior General Pang is strong and awe-inspiring. This humble commander took advantage of the night to slide down the mountain to enter the Qi army camp. They couldn't react in time and ran toward the border. Who taught you this stratagem? Not sure... Please forgive me, Senior General! So in the end, who defeated our troop? I am asking you! I am asking you for the last time! He is Sun Bin, my junior brother. Sun Bin. No matter what, you must bring him here. Bring him here in front of the Wei King. By all means. Only him can save the life of Senior General Tian. Lady, you have been wounded. Sun Bin You are calling me, lady? Aren't you? Reporting! Tian Xi has returned He is outside of the fort. On the carriage there is another man. He is? Speak quickly! Sun Bin, a man from the state of Qi. Sun Bin. Open the Citadel's gate, use national rites to welcome him. I lost the fort, how would I dare to go meet the King? Behead him! Old General Jian, I dare not. The time hasn't come yet? Heaven ordered you to come here to help me. It is a great honor for the state of Qi. The army of the Great Qi welcome you. please get off the carriage so that we can greet you! Who dared beat you up so bad? I ran into a weird animal on the way to here. The beast likes Bin and wants to eat Bin. Evidently Bin couldn't accept that and fought against it. The weird animal ran away. Bin got just a few minor scratches. Please. Senior, what is the name of that female warrior? Please release Old General Jian immediately. His Majesty is very bright. he rallies the people and treats the wise and learned well. He enhances the reputation of the State of Qi. It is very fortunate, very fortunate. Students of Gui Guzi include Pang Juan and Sun Bin. But only one is the true student who learned the best from him. Yes. Between your brother and Sun Bin, who is better? My brother fought against Sun Bin on the mountain. At that time, both were students of Gui Guzi. Gui Guzi wanted his two students to play hide and seek. Sun Bin hid in the forest. My brother couldn't find him. So he pretended to be wounded, and Sun Bin immediately showed himself. At that time the bond between them was very strong. It was said that before Pang Juan descended the mountain, he promise to marry his sister to Sun Bin. Am I not always next to you? I was only joking, please don't mind me. It was painful for this old general. Father, your daughter is late. The Tian Clan values daughters more than sons. You saved my life. I lost the fort. I don't dare look at his Majesty's face. How could the fort be lost so easily? It was shameful for our family. Where is the man named Sun Bin? At the court. Please thank him for your father. Old General Tian, In the Tian Clan, a daughter is more precious than a son. Senior General Tian Jian lost the fort. should he be punished or not? What is your opinion, Sir? His crime is as great as yours, Majesty. How dare Sun Bin say that? Sir, please speak your mind. You don't know how to use people? Your Majesty, Sun Bin deserves to be beheaded! Sun Bin's crime is punishable by death! Why? Today, I elevate Sun Bin to the post of Private Counselor His salary and benefits will be above that of a Great Lord Thank you, Your Majesty, but I Sun Bin don't dare to accept. Before I come down the mountain, my Sifu reminded me that i shouldn't become a mandarin, or a general. It is something I should not do. Your senior brother Pang Juan, isn't he not also a general? right. Idiot! Clearly he wants to die! Not so. not so? He doesn't want to be a mandarin, or a general. Why not let him become a guest of the House of Tian? who is this Tian? Thank you, your Majesty! Why are you following me closely? I am your house guest. Old General Tian told me to thank you for saving his life. No need - He committed a grave fault. Thank you so much, Sir, for letting me know. General Tian is my father. Even if Sun Bin likes the Master of the House, Nevertheless, the general did commit a very grave crime. What did you say? the crime is? You just said something about liking? The Master of the House might not look like a lady, But Bin really like.. Take it easy, don't be too forceful! Go tell the Master of the House that I am very clean! I don't need to take a bath! Why do it? it is so unbecoming! I already told you I don't need to take a bath! Our Master said you are very dirty, Sir. You must be bathed and cleansed before you can be a guest of the House of Tian Save me! Can you hear anything now? I am sure you can hear something. Why did you dive down so deep? Sun Bin.. The Master of the House is bathing with you. Master of the House, here are your shoes. The Master of the House didn't put the shoes on. Here are the shoes, Master of the House. Too cruel! Where is everybody? Do you have anything to tell us? What are you laughing at? A little empathy make you laugh too? The Master of your house beats me with a stick, he assaulted a man with no weapon whatsoever. he also attacked suddenly. And that make you laugh? I won't argue with you anymore! Please send the following message to the Master of the House. we must use reason to win people over. This is not a battlefield. I am not her enemy, I am her houseguest! She must attract and treat the wise well and give feasts to the learned to earn my heartfelt respect. And there is one more thing, She didn?t slap my face, she only hit my body. That is something that is praiseworthy! Are you happy with that? Just go? I heard that this "Cui Guzi Military Manual" was transmitted only to Sun Bin, and never to Pang Juan? Pang Juan isn't well versed in any military strategy. His Majesty is going back! There is no such thing as a "Gui Guzi Military Manual" Just rumors. How do you know that no military manual exists? I studied with Sifu in more than ten disciplines. For many years I led troops on the battlefield based on their courage, based on my ability to use military strategies and tactics. and so I don't believe that there is a military strategy that will win each and every time. I am going to attend a Gathering of Kings at the Luo River. The King of Wei is saying that he is sick and ordered general Pang Juan to go. Lady, please help me seduce Sun Bin. The people of the state of Qi all hope that she will achieve great deeds. Kings! Let's start the ceremony! Kings! Please sit down for The annual gathering at the Luo River. Kings from the four directions came at the appointed time. I am very happy. Only King Hui of the State of Wei... Respectfully reporting to the Son of Heaven, My King is gravely ill and thus couldn't come. The states that belong to my Great Zhou state, were chaotic for many years and the number of people wounded and killed was innumerable. The struggle between Qi and Wei resulted in rivers of blood. What happened to all people under the heaven fill my heart with pain. This gathering is to take over the forts at the borders of the state of Qi. What happened to your nose? Di Lu kicked me! You are invited to come to the State of Qi? ?then you must lead the horse for a walk! Please wait for me. It is so dark and scary here! Master of the House, please go slowly. I don't see anything. Master of the House, the troops are well disciplined and well trained. Do you know who he is? His name is Sun Bin. He is the one who taught the Wei troop to take advantage of the heavenly dog eating the sun (the solar eclipse). Why is he hiding? Just let them admire you. Honored! Honored! King of Han I didn't settle last year's battle with you. So why don't we settle that score now To get it over with. States big and small all are children of my Great Zhou All are? Stop arguing. Let's follow the old tradition, and have a chariot race to determine winners and losers. Young general, please have some wine before you leave. All I want to do is to escort your Majesty. You want to leave, Sir? The King is in another country, so it is natural to be impatient. Then you go ahead without me, right now, His Majesty doesn't agree. So how can I leave before him? Hypocrite! it is noon! Let's get going. Let him do it. High mandarins, please return. Master of the House, Di Lu is winning you over? How do you know? I understand the language of horses. The biggest braggart in the whole world is you! I will ask Di Lu to speak, it will speak along with me. Do you believe me? No. What if I am right? say whatever you want. If it really can speak The Master of the House will let Bin kiss your eyes, agreed? Fine. I am right! Let Bin kiss you your eyes once! Do what you said! Let Bin give you a kiss, please! Before, the reason why I ordered you to go to the state of Wei. was to help find a chance for the state of Qi. Now that Wei troop took over a fort, I am so afraid I am sweating. Your Majesty, please don't worry. I, Pang Juan, am here. The Wei army can't beat the Qi army. The Master of the House must keep his word. If you said nothing, it would be fine. But if you promised, you must keep your promise. Let me kiss the Master of the House once. Not saying anything means you agreed. The Master of the House use a sword, rather than an arm, this time. This means she won't dare attack Qi. Or could it be that the Master of the House also like Sun Bin? Where is everybody? Nothing! Nothing! I told you nothing! Nothing! Master of the House, Master of the House? He came down with a cold. Just drink a lot of ginger water. Juan Greetings, Senior Brother! Master of the House, here is my Senior Brother Pang Juan. Here is the Master of the House, Tian Xi. My senior brother used to be able to drink a lot of wine! he still can do it now. Senior Brother, please help me. How can I help? In a moment please let me and the Master of the House leave by ourselves. Fine, I understand. let's play hide and seek with you. see who will find me first. And then later... Later I let her capture me. I was gone by then. Right right. Master of the House, I go hide now. These two won't be able to find me. Di Lu, it has been quite a while since we last met! Five years! Yes, five years. Each night I look in the direction of the State of Qi, and hope that you would fly down. You speak less and less. I live in the State of Wei As a Wei woman, I need to be be my guard and let no one hear us. WARRING STATES (2011) When I was little and living up the mountain, Often I sat by myself alone. You hide too well, we couldn't find you. Master of the House, do you want to know how I feel when I saw her for the first time? the feeling I had then? I don't want to? The horse race between Qi and Wei is just something that was arranged. If Di Lu is here, Qi will certainly win. This time, let them win the race. The Wei border forts can't be taken back. So why even think of winning or losing? Pang Juan had a change of heart. we can't win this horse race. Wei wins! Master of the House, Di Lu was poisoned and had died. The day before he had a crisis Master of the House, Sun Bin saw Di Lu die. He ride the chariot himself, no one can't stop him. The second heat you can't go. Di Lu has died. Our horse can't win. Not necessarily. Match our weak horses against their strong horses. Math our strong horses against their medium horses. Match our average horses against their weak horses. I don?t quite understand what you said. even if we tried our best, the best we can do is to come out even. You still have me here. I understand horses. Qi wins! The problem is not winning or losing. You can't go. The Qi race horse has entered the battle. The Wei people are waiting for us. So you are the ones who harmed Di Lu? Third heat! Even if you kill the horse, you still lose. Qi wins! No, General? Sun Bin! Sub Bin! You know how to make the heavenly dog eat the sun (a solar eclipse) About this story? I can't even take care of myself. I want the Master of the House to know a secret related to the heavenly dog eating the sun event. Because Sun Bin studied astronomy under his Sifu, he was able to guess right, that's all there is to it. Senior Brother, what now Bin? I am fine. No problems. Are you hurt? Anything get to me, what? which hurt? I fell of the chariot and you didn?t even pay attention! No, I did? Please come with me to the state of Wei Where are you taking him? Where to? Stop! Don't worry, Head of the House, they? Put the sword down. What are you doing? His Majesty has come. Because he lost the last race, The King of Wei wants to capture Sun Bin and take him away. What happens if he can't do that? The great army will come, and the state of Qi won't be secure. How about the fort and fortifications? Minor details! Let me bring Sun Bin, and I will return the fort. Fine. Bin, go. I am waiting for the Head of the House, Go! Let's go! We must wait for the head of the House to see us out. Head of the House, Head of the House? Go Senior Brother, just let go! Each night I look at the State of Qi. Pang Juan has changed his mind. Yes, it has been five years already? that this flute saved my life. I would like to give you.. Head of the House, do you know what is the best thing in this world that Bin saw? What? They eyes of the Head of the House So you are indeed the Sun Bin that people talked about. Your Sifu has given the military manual to him. Bin is smarter than me. What is this place? This is where I study military strategies. I feel safe whenever I am here. Not bad, no one is here. Just the two of us. Clean Bin, come here, Please write down the military manual that Sifu transmitted to you. What for? I want to read it. Let's drink up! Sir Sun, may I ask you a question? After we captured this border fort, why don't we press on and take the Qi capital? You can't take the Qi capital. Why can't we take the Qi capital? When Senior General Pang led you to take that fort, it was an abandoned fort. An abandoned fort? Why was it an abandoned fort? Any place that is well guarded, is a place where conflicts happen regularly. Such places are not worth the trouble. You don't get what I said? Sir, if we let you lead this battle, is it what you are going to do? I won't lead this battle and attack. why won't you? If the country has no wars to fight, soldiers will become farmers, so why should they fight? Don't you guys want to go back home and farm? Yes we do. Before you all go back to the State of Wei, I heard the news that The King of Wei wants Sun Bin to write down the military manual and then eliminate him. I am here, who dares to touch him? Brother, you don't know it yet. Knowing too much might get you killed. But wouldn?t what you are doing will lead you to your death also? Brother, so the reason you came to Wei rwas really to seek to stay alive? Don't think that I don't know. Years ago when the King of Qi gave me to the King of Wei, The chess game was set. The use of military force requires preparation. even a small fort could be defended through careful preparations. the number of soldiers might be small, but strength come from the righteous cause. Wars don't need a righteous cause. So it means that no one is invincible in this world. States that keep its word grow and prosper. Doom comes to whoever uses military force with belligerence. Sun Bin Sun Bin, please get up, quickly. Hurry up and write, the King of Wei wants to see. I already wrote. Am I not your brother? Yes you are. Then write it all down quickly. And if you write a fake military manual, remember that cheating his Majesty is punishable by death. Even I can't make that charge of away. Senior Brother, the truth is I wrote it all out for you. I will go tell the King of Wei. Sir Sun, Your Majesty, I was hunting when suddenly I saw two bird fighting over food. I use my bow to shoot them. The two birds Sun and Pang started to cry. Sir, please hurry and go? Go with us, quickly. where to? Don't ask! where do you want me to go? Sir, let's go. Go Finish your story and then go. Return to the State of Qi quickly. Why? Hurry, escort him away. Don't you know? There are people who want to harm you. If you don't run now, it may be too late. Someone wants to harm me? No one is trying to harm me. You are stupid! Really stupid! Take him away quickly! Madame Jun please tell them that I can't go. Please say just one word! Senior Brother, Senior Brother, please climb in! Senior Brother Senior General, Wan Er, what do you want? To see him off? ?going back to the State of Qi. May I ask you, Madame Jun, Does Sun Bin have any problem in the state of Wei? You and Madame Jun, what are you doing running outside? To look for me to play with me Bin You are making things up Sun Bin colluded with the State of Qi. Should be he killed or not? Since when, senior General did you become as weak as a woman? Your Majesty, If you kill Sun Bin, people will say that the State of Wei is jealous of talented men and no one will come to serve. What do you think? All we need to do is to guard him strictly. Don't let him run away. Wait for him to change his mind and turn over the military manual. I can't believe you are so thorough. Then let's take him to a place where he can't escape from, accuse him of treason and then use torture to break his legs. Not a bad idea. Tomorrow, I will have people take you back to the State of Qi. Is that true? I really want to go back to Qi, it is so boring here. There is no one I would like to meet here. I miss Tian Xi a lot. I also don't want to be away from you. I will come to see you, senior brother. What does the King of Wei think? Does he trust me? Don't think about them. I already told them, That Sifu didn't transmit any military manual to me. whatever Sifu transmitted to me, I already wrote it all down for you. I wrote down whatever I wrote Right, that's true. Senior Brother, The King of Wei doesn't trust me, and now you don't trust me too? Why? Why? Senior Brother, are you mad at me? Sun Bin, Sun Bin was tempted by beauty and skill He colluded with the State of Qi to spy on Wei he become a secret spy for them. His Majesty ordered his arrest, and condemned him to have his patella bone broken. Bin, Do you know that stupid kings like those are shameless low life, that must be exterminated to help get rid of wars and allow all under heaven to rest and recover? Can you do it? You can do it, I will help you. Not possible. So will you support me? Read the military manual Senior Brother, Senior Brother, please don't go! I am very afraid, Senior Brother, please? Juan, please don't go. Don't be afraid, it will be over very soon. Go to the State of Qi to let Jian Xi know. Yes. Senior General, I took a piece of bone? Did you get the military manual? His mouth was already gagged. why are you laughing? What are you laughing about? End of CD1 Bin Bin No matter... Read the military manual. I am not giving it to you. Why? I will not turn it over. Juan, just kill me. Continue to pull out another bone! Yes. Kill me! If I save Sun Bin, the state of Wei will do an about-face, and the state of Qi will be in trouble. Qi and Wei will fight. Only Sun Bin could oppose Pang Juan. Majesty, Obeying his Majesty's order, save Sun Bin. The reward will be three hundreds taels of gold. I heard that Sun Bin is being tortured horribly. Don't you want to go see? I have to serve his Majesty still? Go, go? Just to see his face once is also very satisfying, no? I truly don't want to go. Take the lady to go? Yes. Madam, please? Must find a way to escape. Madam Sun Bin has gone mad, where is everybody? Senior General It was broken in two pieces, so even if a key is available, it is useless. Write down the military manual! Pretending to be insane is useless. Are you calling for me? What now? Kill! Everybody, stop! Three days has gone by and I could only think of this hare-brained scheme! What kind of food are you guys eating? Why should I use you all? Senior General, Please consider this - Sun Bin has really gone mad. Chop you up?ha ha.. Drag him out to the market! Yes. Lead him out? Beheading! Beheading! THE WARRING STATES IMAX VN Vietsub by BlueMagic, Engsub by April You and I we haven't seen each other in a while? You were 13 when you were taken... ten years has gone by since then. Sister? Can you help me? Sun Bin has gone mad, please don't incarcerate him any more. Someone is guarding him. If we want to save him, you and I must coordinate. Fine. What is this horrible and deadly smell? The three of us meet again today. We must get really drunk! Then please listen to me. Senior General, Please! Sister? Do you still remember the Tai Zang dance? I vaguely remember it. Can you guide me? Sister, Always remember that everyday Sun Bin crawls to the tree at the crossroad, The road is small, so they won't watch it closely. There, two light carriage can meet without anyone seeing them. But you must act swiftly. Don't forget that! Hurry, get on the carriage. Sir Sun, please get on the carriage quickly. Sir Sun, please hurry and get going. Quickly. Don't let Sun Bin escape! Sun Bin, get on the carriage. Make way! Wei troop is coming, run! Run quickly! Sun Bin Hurry! Why aren't you going? I can't stand leaving you. Assassins! Assassins! Assassins! Me too, I can't stand being away from you? This time, there won't be any assassin anymore, right? Go! what do you mean? Master of the House, is Sir Sun really insane? There isn?t much else we could do, just try our best. Stop! Where are you going? I am bringing grass in. How come you are doing this so early in the morning? Sun Bin, Sun Bin, Sir? Sun Bin, Sir? Sun Bin, Sir? Kill! Speak up! Where is Sun Bin? This is something I would like to ask you. Sun Bin considers that you are the one closest to him. How could you treat him like that? I have done all I could. Sun Bin is now an invalid. What could he do to you? Please let me take Sun Bin away. I beg you! I beg you! I did forgive you all, But because you decided to come back? What is your intention? I understand the language of horses. Where are you going? Return to the state of Qi? You think you all could return? What is your intention? Or do you also want to pull my bones out? I used to forgive you all, But remember this well - there won?t be a second time. Get back. Senior General, There is a hole in the stable! Sun Bin and them use the "lure the tiger out of the mountain" ruse I will not let you all go. They are chasing us. Yu Ci, you go ahead of us and try open the fort's gate. Yes. Hurry? Guards! Open the gates! Opening the gate! Hurry, the State of Qi is right ahead! Get back! Bang Juan, look there! Our State of Qi! Have you forgotten? every person has a private path, you won?t understand mine. His Majesty was right. You have truly changed your mind. If that is the case, I must make you surrender to Qi. Hurry up and stop him! Senior General, where am I? In the State of Qi. Sun Bin Is Sun Bin really insane or not? Really insane or not? Senior General, please take a look. Sun Bin The State of Wei oppressed our Great Qi State Debased what we respect and hold dear. We will cleanse this affront with blood. Pang Juan is brutal. His actions are cruel. The people of Wei are cruel and brutal. Pulling bones from a man's leg is no different from killing the man himself. Sun Bin kill the people from Wei You follow behind His Majesty leading one million strong and heroic soldiers to eliminate the traitors led by Sun Bin. Kill the Wei people! Henceforth, it will be just you and me, the two of us. If you don't eat, I won't eat either,. If you don't sleep, I won't sleep. If you refuse to eat, Tian Er will take care of you. There is an earthquake! Sir Sun, Tian Xi knows that you are suffering. But is your suffering the same as that of the people? Our state of Qi is going through a major crisis from which we might have difficulties recovering. His Majesty is concerned that Wei will attack at this moment. No, Wei must attack Zhao first. we can't help it, majesty, absolutely not. Majesty, if you do so, it will be like harming ourselves. If we don't save Zhao, our country will be in big trouble. National Advisor sent His Majesty a red sachet. Bin heard that over the last few days the Wei army burned and killed everywhere causing the people to bitterly complain. If His Majesty is concerned about the people, The only thing left is to mobilize and start a campaign to bring peace to all under heaven. The National Advisor has arrived! National Advisor, please stop. This man is like me. National Advisor rewards you. Thank you National Advisor. Don't let him come near the National Advisor. National Advisor, it is not convenient to stay here, why don't we just leave? This man is like me. Wei assassins are famous throughout the lands. Luckily today the Master of the House has a supple armor to protect the body. Later on let Bin go. The assassins who tried to kill you, where are they now? They killed themselves using poisons. I submitted a letter requesting that the troops be mobilized within three days. In these three days, there were a lot of strangers in the citadel. After that tragedy, fearing that the people would come into the citadel to cause trouble, the four gates of the citadel were closed. People from inside can go out, but people from outside can?t go in. But there are? there are victims. People who live outside of the citadel are in trouble, their situation is dreary. yesterday while waiting for the court to convene, I allowed a few people to get in. how many people? From 300 to 500 people. That's why. Assassins mingled with the people and got inside the citadel. So what should we do with these people? we go to the soup kitchens that provide relief inside the citadel and kill them all. Old General, we shouldn't do that. Bin has very modest proposal, would you care to consider it? May I invite your Majesty and the court to go with me tomorrow to distribute soup to those afflicted by this event. Distribute soup! One can't be fooled when hungry. Before they go on a mission, Wei assassins ate and drank their fill of meat and wine. Put a lot of hot pepper in the soup. If they are refugees, they will eat it without any hesitation. If they are assassins, they will have a hard time swallowing it, And in the blink of an eye, their true self will be revealed. Soup distribution here! Master of the House, please remember This ruse is indeed a ruse within a ruse. Whoever eat the soup is an assassin. Because a lot of hot pepper was placed in there, regular people can't eat it. whoever took a bite would know this. And so an assassin will be found out immediately. This ruse could be used to identify the traitor who leaked our state secrets. They weren't affected at all. Arrest them! They committed suicide. where are the assassins who were trying to kill you? They took their own poisons and died. I went everywhere looking for you. Why are you here? I am exchanging confidences with Di Lu! Did we find the traitor? Let's just go. that? What did I want to say moments ago? Ah right? Tomorrow you will get on the stand to bow to the commanding general, and so I coming to visit with you. Sun Bin understand. The Master of the House has received the title of National Queen. Right. Right. In dealing with Pang Juan, what is your win/loss percentage? I don't know. Why are you so stupid? Here! Put it on. Master of the House, we don't need that. Master of the House, we truly don't need that. We can't do that, Master of the House. Put it on! Put it on and then you will not die. Later, when I will no longer by near you, you must protect yourself. War is not a game. Returning safely from a war is something good. I wait for you. I can't no longer wait. Tian err is now? The National Queen already? Bin? Later?can I wait for you? Tian Er is now the National Queen. Really? Pang Juan went against all under heaven to mobilize an army. Sun Bin and Pang Juan are fighting with all their might on the battlefield. Destroy troop formation, defeat strange strategies, win over the people. help the people of Zhao achieve peace. You need not worry when fighting on the battlefield. We wait for your victorious return. S? d?ng m?t ph?n d?i l? cho ti?n sinh Senior General! Senior General! Senior General! The state of Qi has mobilized its army to save the state of Qi It will not attack the state of Wei by surprise. Reporting! National Advisor We have arrived. The vanguards have detected Wei troops ahead of us. General Tian proposes that the big army move 3000 troops to the rear. How could 3000 troops fight off the wolf Pang Juan? Then what the National Advisor has in mind is? Reporting! Reporting to the National Advisor, Pang Juan had his doubts and the Old General, How much time will we need to withdraw everyone?
