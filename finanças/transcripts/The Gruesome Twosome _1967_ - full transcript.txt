[♪ Upbeat music] You're new here, aren't you, dearie? I sure am. Hmm! I can tell by your disheveled appearance. Uh... no offense, of course. That's all right. I know you girls live sheltered lives. Well, my life is simply plum full of exciting things. Really? And what is so exciting about your life? I don't think you'd understand. [Chuckling] Well, I must say, you've got a nerve. Honey child, you have to have nerve to go through what I've been through. And what have you been through? Apple dumplin', I've been through bloody murder. And that's a fact. Mmm... that's nice. Don't fight. Murder... well, you do look a fright, dearie. [Chuckles] Ignorance really is bliss. Sugar pie, you ever been to college? College? What's that got to do with anything? Somehow, I knew you wouldn't understand. I've been to college and believe me, I got a real education. Matter of fact, that's where this all happened. You're talking in circles. College, honey lamb, is where I flipped my wig. Or rather, where I became what I am today. [Laughing] I can believe the last part then, but college? Dearie, you are funny. - What degrees do you have? - [♪ Soft jazz music] Crime-like virtue has its degrees. As Mrs. Pringle always said. College, crime, Mrs. Pringle? I think you're wiggy, dearie. Why, thank you! Now, if you'll just hush, I'll tell you what happened on my college campus. I mean, the story of Mrs. Pringle, the co-eds, Napoleon and Rodney. He's actually responsible for my being here. That Rodney certainly knew how to use a knife. - A knife? - Oh yes, sweet potato. Why, Rodney could raise the hair off your head. [Laughing] You silly thing! Dearie, you realize I don't believe any of this? [Screaming] [Laughing] Experiencin' is believin'. As Mrs. Pringle always said. [♪ Soft, mysterious jazz music] - May I help you, dear? - Oh! Yes. I've come to see about the ad that you have in the paper for a room for rent. - Is it still vacant? - Indeed it is. It certainly is. I'm so glad to know you. I'm Mrs. Pringle. I'll show you the room. Get away, kitty, get away. Oh, that cat. Napoleon, did you come to meet our pretty visitor? Isn't she a lovely girl with just lovely brown hair? Beauty can inspire a miracle, as I always say. Don't I, Napoleon? And now, I'd like to show you the room, my dear. Rodney will be delighted. Simply delighted. Who's Rodney? Oh, you just come along with me, my dear. You'll meet Rodney soon enough. Yes, indeed. What lovely wigs. Is this your business, Mrs. Pringle? Yes, this is my little wig business. Rodney and I and, of course, Napoleon, find it very nice. Of course, my dear, it is very difficult to find just the right wigs. And we're very particular, aren't we, Napoleon? I think it's just wonderful living here like you do running your own little business. If I take the room, I'll be sure and tell the girls on campus about your wigs. Oh, fine. May I see the room now, please? Of course, my dear. That's why you're here. Come with me. [♪ Suspenseful music] I don't understand. Is the room here? Yes, my dear. Rodney, my love, there's a visitor to see the room. Oh, no. [Screams] [Inaudible] [Screams] [Screaming continues] Gracious, Napoleon. What a clumsy girl. [Rodney grunting] [Continues screaming] [Rodney guffawing] [Screaming ceases] [Rodney guffawing madly] [♪ Upbeat jazz music] - Hi, how's it going? - Oh, fine, Dave. You're late. We'll both be late for class. Oh, my lab class held me up again as usual. I'll pick you up tonight around eight, OK? Oh, Dave, I'm sorry. I promised Dawn I'd help her look for an apartment. She's moving off-campus this semester. I forgot all about our date. That's great. You know, this is the third date that you've forgotten about this week, Kathy. First you had to help Sally find her stolen earrings that turned out not to be stolen. Then it was the big search for Mrs. Archer's parakeet that you were convinced was in the pot pie that we had for lunch yesterday. And now it's an apartment for Dawn. Oh, for goodness sakes, Dave. We're together all the time. Honest, I'm sorry, but I promised Dawn. We'll go out tomorrow night and I won't let anything interfere. OK? Come on. We better get a move on. - Hi, how are ya? - Hi, Kathy. What do you think about those missing girls? The whole campus is talkin' about it. I know it. It is strange, all right. Three girls just disappearing like that. Yeah, it is. And that's all I want you to think about it. Brother, that's all I need. Kathy Baker, girl detective. How'd I ever get mixed up with a female James Bond? - Bye. - Bye. [Sighs] We've looked at seven rooms, Dawn. If we don't find one soon, Dave's not going to speak to me. - Really? - Yeah. He's mad again. I'm breaking too many dates. Dawn, you can't move out of the dorm now. Not with all these girls disappearing. It gives me the creeps just even thinking about it. [Kathy gasps] Janet's right, Dawn. The campus is a safe place. No one knows what's happened to these girls. And they all lived off-campus. Oh, don't be silly. I admit it's spooky, but I think there's a perfectly good explanation for it. Anyway, I have to move since I'm taking a part-time job in town. It's too hard to get back and forth. [♪ Upbeat jazz playing on radio] Ooh, baby. Ooh, baby. [All chuckling] [♪ Music stops] 'Please stand by for an important announcement 'regarding the murders in this area.' [Janet] Oh, my God. 'Please stand by.' [Newscaster] 'We interrupt this program to bring you a bulletin 'on the disappearance of three co-eds from the university. 'Captain John Howell of the Brockton Police Department 'has just issued a statement 'that evidence leads the police to believe 'that the three co-eds may have been murdered. 'We ask all female students 'to remain in the dormitories after dark. 'Complete details on the 10 o'clock news. 'And now we return you to Rudy and the Rascals.' - [♪ Music resumes on radio] - I knew it. I felt all along something terrible happened to those girls. Dawn, I think you should stay here until something more is uncovered. Kathy, for goodness sake. I admit it's scary. But what's the difference in staying right inside the dorm at night and right in my own room? After all, I'm not looking for a room in the public park. - [All chuckling] - [Girl] You are. Oh, by the way, may I borrow your gold barrette? Yeah, sure. I don't know, it's... I still think you should stay here, Dawn. It's just... it's just a feeling. Kathy, if we paid any attention to your feelings, we'd all end up in the loony bin. - Or in jail. - [All chuckling] Come on. Let's stop being morbid. Open that paper to the "Rooms for Rent" section. The "Rooms for Rent" section. The radio said the police suspected murder, Dave. Imagine! In this city! Murder can happen in any city, Kathy. The police are doing everything they can. Oh, but are they, Dave? I mean, they only suspect murder. You'd think they'd know by now! Dave, suppose you and I did a little checking? Maybe we'd find something that could help the police. Hold on. The police don't need any help. And I don't want you going off on any snooping excursions. This is serious, Kathy, and it could be dangerous. There's a possible killer loose. That's the point. All the girls are students. Now, where is a better place to look than right here on campus? Kathy, I don't want you to get involved. The police have checked the campus. And they don't need any help. I know how you get carried away over things like this and it worries me. This is no simple little mystery. Dave, you know Mr. Spinsen, the janitor? Now, there's a mysterious man if I ever saw one. - What? - What! Yes. He's the just the type that would do something like that. Good grief, Kathy! Man, you're something else. Mr. Spinsen! Look, enough is enough. Maybe you don't have to go to class, but I do. Just leave Mr. Spinsen out of this and you stay out of it yourself. I'll call you later. [♪ Dramatic music] [Screaming] - What is going on? - [Screams] Police! I caught the man! He's going to kill me, too! Help! Young lady, I don't know what you're shouting about, but nobody has murdered nobody around here. [Sirens wailing in distance] But what are you doing in my yard? Sir, I'm the one that called. Something terrible's been going on here. All the screaming. My little girl has the mumps and can't sleep. What is it? Arrest that man, Officer. He murdered those poor co-eds. I can prove it. He buried their bodies right there in these bushes! Hey, I don't know what she's talkin' about. I want her arrested for trespassing in my yard. I don't know what's going on here either, mister, but there's something that has been buried here. Now, you better talk. And talk fast. I will talk and I will talk plenty. Those bones are for my dog, Odin. Every year, at Odin's birthday, I bring home the soup bones from the kitchen of the university. I bury the bones, Odin digs them up. This way we have birthday party. The cook at the college will tell you, we do this every year. I sneak out the bones because I don't want to cause the cook in trouble. But murder, I do not do! But, but... I thought he was the killer. I mean, I watched him take the bones and I followed him home. But you gotta admit, it did look strange burying them and all. Now, missy, you have caused enough trouble. Following people, accusing them of murder and now trespassing. What is your name? Kathy, sir. Kathy Baker. Kathy Baker... I've heard that name before. [Snaps fingers] Oh, yes. You're the girl who turned in a complaint about a body being hidden in a closet at the school. We had to send three men back to get new uniforms because of that. It turned out to be one of the student's pet skunks. Get in my police car. I'm gonna take you back to the dorm. But first, you apologize to this gentleman. - I apologize. - Hmm. Eh, birthday party start all over. [Doorbell ringing] Do come in. - May I help you, dear? - I hope so. I'm interested in a wig for my daughter. Oh, indeed. You've come to the right place. We have the finest wigs that money can buy. In life, we get what we order, I always say. Don't I, Napoleon? These are lovely. Almost human. Uh, what color is your daughter's hair? She has dark brown hair. She had it very long, and has cut it very short. It's darker than this. Seems all the girls are cutting their hair and then buying wigs. Indeed. Everything's a fad with the young ones today. Of course, I can't complain. Can I, Napoleon? But dark brown hair? We just don't have a dark brown wig now. How soon do you need it? There's no rush. A week or two will be fine. Here's a swatch of her hair. I'll leave it and stop back in. Well, that's splendid, dear. What a lovely color. A little hard to match, but we'll do our best. Won't we, Napoleon? - Good day. - Goodbye. Gracious, Napoleon. How am I ever going to match that child's hair? That vicious dog literally attacked me trying to get those bones. I tell you, it was horrible. If it weren't for the police coming at that very minute, I'd have been a goner! Kathy, you said the neighbor called the police and that Mr. Spinsen was attacking you. - [All chuckle] - I did? Well, I mean, the neighbor did call the policeman as he was cruising by. Kathy, you are something. Why can't you ever stay out of trouble? Imagine. Following Mr. Spinsen home and then accusing him of murder. Now look, maybe I did make a mistake. But it could've been Mr. Spinsen committing those murders. Or anyone. If we don't follow every possible clue, why, we could all end up dead. Or worse. Kathy, what could be worse than being dead? But we don't have anything to worry about because we have you for a roommate. But it isn't every dorm that has its own built-in detective system. Oh, all right. But if something horrible does happen, just don't call on me to find out. [♪ Slow surf music] [Nancy] Hi, everybody. I thought I'd drop by and see the hero. Nancy, your hair. My gosh, it's beautiful. - Isn't it fabulous? - Oh, gorgeous. This is the wig I've been waiting for. Doesn't it look just like real hair? It sure does. Hey, it is real hair, isn't it? Where'd you get it, Nan? My kid sister's been bugging the whole family for a fall. Bet it was expensive, huh? No, not really. I was very lucky. I went downtown, found this little wig shop. And this sweet old lady and her son run it. And all you have to do is cut off a little piece of hair and she matches it just perfectly. It looks just like... oh. But it cost me almost a month's allowance. But it was worth it. I can hardly wait to show Bob. Hey, write the address down for me, will you? OK. - It is beautiful. - Isn't it beautiful? Oh, I got to run. I'm late for my date. So long, then. We're still apartment-hunting. - I'll see you later. - Yeah, we'll see you, Dawn. [All] Bye. Take it easy, have a good time. [♪ "Brahms' Lullaby" melody] That's a good boy, Rodney, dear. You've been working so hard lately, we've hardly had time for a visit, have we? You want Mother to tell you a story? [Grunts] Your dear father, the Lord rest his soul, always loved a storytelling session after a hard day's work. Rodney wants a story. Tell me the story about Rapunzel and the golden hair. That's my very favorite one. That always was your favorite story, dear. Now, make your special promise to Mother and she'll tell it to you. No. No. Rodney wants to hear the story first. No. Rodney, you do not pout at Mother. Now, make your special promise. Hurry up. It's near your nap time. No! Rodney wants to hear the story first! Rodney can be such a naughty boy. And you know how Mother likes naughty boys. They get switches in their stockings at Christmas. Now, Mother doesn't tell stories to naughty boys until you make your promise. Rodney is sorry he was naughty. And making promise to be Mother's good boy. Oh, that's nice, dear. And now your special promise. I promise to be a good boy always and listen to Mother so that I can live here forever and never have to go away to a place for bad boys. [Chuckles] Oh, that's splendid, dear. That's fine. And now that you've been such a good boy, Mother has a present for you. - [Gasps] - An electric knife. And now, Mother will tell you a story. Once upon a time, there was a beautiful girl named Rapunzel with long, beautiful golden hair. She was such a lovely... [♪ Upbeat jazz music] [Madeline] 'I love you, Terrence.' - [Munching loudly] - [♪ Classical music] 'I love you, Terrence. 'Tell me that you care, too. 'Oh, tell me, Terrence, I implore you.' [Smack] [Terrence] 'I... '...love you... - '...too, Madeline.' - 'Terrence, I... 'I...' Dave, for goodness sakes. Dawn and Tom can see us. Not if they can keep that up, they can't. Well, OK then. We wouldn't want to be the only ones that knew what this movie was all about. [Moaning] [Madeline] 'Oh, Terrence. Why is it I can't reach you?' - [Terrence munching] - 'Why is it you're so cold, 'so distant, so unfeeling? 'Oh, how I long to hold you, kiss you, 'caress you, squeeze you. 'Can't you talk to me, Terrence? 'Why can't we communicate? 'Oh, speak to me, Terrence, my love!' [Terrence munching] 'Mmm!' 'Oh, Terrence, you're so strong, so masterful, so fun.' [Terrence belches] - 'Oh, Terrence.' - [Terrence munching] 'Something has come between us. 'What is it, Terrence? What is this thing?' [Terrence moaning] 'Mmm... a banana.' [Madeline] 'Kiss me, my darling. Kiss me.' [Terrence] 'Hold it.' [Madeline] 'Oh, I can't get enough of you, my love. 'Kiss me, kiss me.' [Terrence munching] So romantic in a drive-in movie. This is just great, Dave. Dave, do you ever wonder what all these people in all these cars are doing? Nice thoughts for a young girl like you. Oh, I don't mean that. Honestly, Dave, sometimes you just say the worst things. What I mean is, well, what are they doing with their lives? How do they think? Where do they live? Well, I feel we're just surrounded, right this very minute, by simply fascinating people we can't even begin to know. Maybe there's a group of nuclear scientists relaxing at this movie before they plan their first trip to the moon. Or perhaps even a spy, just loaded with all kinds of secrets to overthrow the government, or even... Or maybe there's a guy in one of those cars who's absolutely out of his mind to make mad, passionate love to his best girl. [Madeline] 'Oh, Terrence, don't you think it's time we...' - [Terrence] 'No'. - '...had a talk? 'I mean it, Terrence. 'You've been avoiding this discussion. 'But if we mean anything to each other, 'please listen to me.' [Terrence belches] [Terrence sighs] 'Hmm?' [Madeline] 'You've got to stay to hear me out. 'This is the most important moment of my life.' [Terrence] 'Have some beer.' [Madeline] 'Oh, who can drink beer at a moment like this?' [Terrence] 'I can.' [Madeline] 'Why must you be so callous, so crude?' - [Terrence belches] - 'Why must you avoid the issue? 'Haven't you anything to say to me, Terrence?' [Terrence] 'More beer.' Dave! Why are you so gushy all the time? Honestly, don't you ever think of anything besides love? Hey, what's going on up there? We spent a buck and a half to get in here. Why can't we get some peace and quiet? Honestly, Kathy, can't you ever concentrate on anything - besides mysteries? - Oh. I'm sorry, honey. I guess I do get carried away. Forgive me? Dave? What if the murderer is right here in this drive-in, hiding out from the police? Well, I'll bet we could just go ahead and catch... - Here we go again. - [Dawn giggles] Well, the movie's over anyway. Let's go home, folks. Boy, you can chase murderers around here all night if you want to, but I've got to get home. I've got an early appointment in the morning to see an apartment. - [Engine starting] - Hold it, my Coke. [Doorbell ringing] Good afternoon. Um... I'd like to see the room you have for rent. Is it still vacant? Perfect. Perfect! Gifts come on high in their own peculiar form. Oh, do come in, my dear. The room is waiting for a pretty girl like you. Such lovely, long brown hair. I'm glad you still have the room. I've been looking for simply days. Well, you shan't waste another moment, will she, Napoleon? You know she's just the right one, don't you, you clever cat? - Isn't she lovely? - Uh, yes. Uh... oh, I'm Dawn Farrell. I'm a student at the university. Oh, I'm Mrs. Pringle and this is Napoleon. Really, my dear, you're exactly what we've been waiting for. Oh, and now the room. I do hope you like it. Oh, well, I think I'll love it. Could I see it now? I've got a class this evening and I can't be late. Of course, my dear. You can leave those things there. - You won't be needing them. - All right. Get your happiness out of your work or you'll never know what happiness is, I always say. Don't I, Napoleon? Come right this way. I'll show you your new room. Is the room here? Yes, indeed. Really, it's very convenient. You're quiet and away from the rest of the house and you have your own entrance. Well, I guess it'll be OK. I wasn't exactly expecting it to be like this. Oh, the room is over there, my dear. Oh, I see. Oh, is this your hobby, Mrs. Pringle? I'll bet you're the woman Nancy Harris bought her wig from. Of course, she said the wig shop was run by a nice lady and her son. When she gave me the address, I never dreamed that it would be... Nancy Harris? Well, my dear, she gave you the address? Well, it is certainly possible. You see, this little wig business helps support myself, and Napoleon, and my son Rodney. I see. Uh... does Rodney live here, too, Mrs. Pringle? Oh, yes. Rodney's a good boy. I couldn't be in business without him. "A boy's will is the wind's will, "and the thoughts of youth are long, long thoughts." Longfellow. [Dawn] Hey! "The doors we open and close each day "decide the lives we live." Right, Napoleon? Hey. Mrs. Pringle. Mrs. Pringle, come back. Open the door. [Rodney guffawing] Who's there? Who are you? No! Get away from me! No! [Screaming] [Screaming stops] [Rodney mumbling gibberish] [♪ Playing rock music] [Indistinct chatter] [Yelps] You're not gonna get me! You know there's a penalty for throwing water over my head? Is that right? What's that, Dave? This. Now, isn't this better than running around playing detective? You know, we don't spend any time at all together, Kathy. I'm getting lonesome. Oh, you know I love you. Very much. I'm worried about Dawn. She never came back to the dorm last night. Well, I hope nothing has happened. Can't we spend one afternoon without you worrying about something happening to someone? David Ford. If you have no feelings for anyone but yourself, well, maybe I made a big mistake about you. Well, we have a murderer running around loose. Anything could have happened to poor Dawn. And all you care about is... Oh, just take me home! That's a good idea. [Knocking on door] May I help you, dear? Did you come to see the room? No, ma'am. I came to see if you buy hair. I saw your sign and wondered if you'd consider my hair. I need some money. Mercy me. I think you've come to the right place. Do come in, my dear. My, yes, you have lovely hair. Rodney would be delighted, even though he didn't expect to work today. But there's a time for work and a time for play, I always say. Right, Napoleon? What's the matter, dear? Why are you crying? Are you afraid? No, ma'am, I'm not afraid. It's just that I hate to lose my hair. Oh. You poor child. But don't worry, Rodney will be as gentle as possible. Nobody can steal what's in your head or in your heart, I always say. Right, Napoleon? Come with me, dear. It'll be over as quick as you can snap your fingers. Rodney, my dear, we have another visitor. And remember, tonight is Thursday, and Napoleon always has litter on Thursday. Right this way, my dear. Mrs. Pringle? Mrs. Pringle. What room is this? [Rodney muttering] Who are you? [Screaming] [Rodney grunting] [Girl grunting] [Car engines revving] [Indistinct commentary] [Commentator] Number 46, Arthur Greenwall... [Commentator] There's another car pile just back there on the second turn. Hey, Dave, where's that gal of yours? She bug out on you, man? Nah, we had a mutual disagreement. I've been letting her cool off. I guess I better go call her though. [♪ Light orchestral music] Hi, Dave. No, Kathy isn't here. She left this afternoon. No, we thought she went with you. I don't think so, but I'll check and see. Hey, does anyone know where Kathy went? [Girls together] No. Sorry, Dave. You know Kathy, she's probably out witch-hunting again. No, Dawn never came back. Now, that's something that has us all worried. Kathy just may have done that. Dave, you don't think anything has happened to her, do you? Well, call me back if you find her. Bye-bye. Hey, was that Jude on the phone? No, it was Dave Ford. He's looking for Kathy. I'm getting worried, Lisa. Dawn's gone and now Kathy's disappeared. So, what's the big fuss? I know where Kathy's at. You do? Where is she? Sure. Dawn left a note for her this morning. Well, what did the note say? Well, Dawn went apartment-hunting again and she said if she found a room she'd go ahead and rent. She wanted Kathy to come back and pick her up after classes, then they could get their things. And I didn't... I forgot to give the note to Kathy until this morning. Come to think of it, she got all excited when I did give her the note. You don't suppose that's where she went? Oh, Lisa, this is terrible. Don't you understand? If Dawn did find a room, she wouldn't just leave her things here. Oh, something must have happened, and now Kathy's gone. You don't think they've been murdered, do you? Oh, I don't know what to think. Lisa, do you remember what the address was? Oh, golly... no. Wait a minute. Somewhere on Elm Street. 117. 117, Elm Street, that's it. Well, so what are you gonna do now? I'm gonna call the police. [♪ Mysterious music] [Doorbell ringing] Land sakes, Napoleon. Who could be calling at this hour? Bless my soul, child, may I help you? Come in. Please excuse me, ma'am, but I'm looking for the young lady that came to rent a room from you earlier this week. Dawn. Dawn Farrell. I know it's late, but I want to talk with her. Dawn? Dawn Farrell? Why, we don't know anyone by that name, do we, Napoleon? Well, you must be wrong. You see... Dawn wrote this address right here. She has to be here. She has very long dark brown hair. Ah, I remember now! Yes, the beautiful girl with the long dark brown hair. She was here, but she didn't come to rent a room. She came to buy a wig. A wig? But I thought... I don't know what to think. A wig? Wait a minute. You must be the lady that sold the wig to Nancy Harris. Gee. I must've gotten my notes all mixed up. - Mrs, uh, Mrs... - Uh, Pringle. Mrs. Pringle. And this is Napoleon. Mrs. Pringle, I apologize for all these questions, but I am worried about my friend. And your address is the last place that we know for sure that she went. That is strange. I'm sorry, dear. I wish we could be of some help. Oh, well. I guess I better go. - Oh. - Sorry for troubling you. It's no trouble at all, dear, no trouble at all. Come anytime. [♪ Soft jazz music] Napoleon, I'm afraid we have a problem. Mercy, whatever possessed that child to take our address down. Well, if things go wrong, don't go with them, I always say. Don't I, Napoleon? [♪ Mysterious music] [Kathy to herself] 'If Dawn came here to buy a wig, 'where did she go? 'And why did she say she came here to rent a room 'if she really came to buy a wig? 'Something is wrong. 'And I'm going back to find out what it is.' Well, well, my dear. I see you didn't leave after all. I told you I heard a noise, Napoleon. And now, my dear, I think you'll find exactly what you came for. [Screams] [Mrs. Pringle] 'Ah, yes, I remember now. 'Our little girl with the dark brown hair. Right, Napoleon?' - [Rodney mumbling] - Who are you? Who are you? [Police sirens wailing] [Officer] This is the police. [Banging on door continues] My, my, my! Why are they banging out there? Just a minute. Gracious! You men look so perspired. May I get you a glass of iced tea? No, thank you, ma'am. We had a report of some trouble here. "Trouble"? Mercy me. We never have any trouble here. Do we, Napoleon? Now, why don't you nice young men come in and relax? Gracious, you look all in a huff. Have you seen a girl with long blonde hair? We know she's been here. Long blonde hair? Why, you poor young man. I believe he's lost his best girl, Napoleon. Now, why don't you come inside and relax and we'll see what we can do to help you. Come, come, come, come. Follow me, follow me. Come in. Come right this way, gentlemen. The girls at the dorm told me that Kathy positively came to this address. Now, where is she? The dorm? Kathy? Young man, you are upset. Why don't you sit over here and we'll make things fine and dandy again. Now, then, that's better. Suppose we start from the beginning. Who are you looking for? And why in the world would you think she's here? Ma'am, I'm beginning to think this whole thing has been a mistake. Look, if this turns out to be some kind of college prank... This is no prank. I called the dorm later and the girls told me that Dawn Farrell had rented a room at this address. And that Kathy had gone to find her here. Now they've both disappeared. Son, I'm beginning to believe that you have a good imagination. - [Thud] - Gracious! Our boarder must be putting up another picture, Napoleon. I must speak to him about hammering so late at night. Leave me! Leave me alone. [♪ Tense jazz music] Hold it there, sonny. I want to open that door and see what's going on in there. That didn't sound like hammering to me. No one opens this door unless you have my permission. Ma'am, I'm sorry. I think this kid has flipped his wig. [Muffled screaming] There, did you hear that? Hammerin', huh? I'm going in there. Well, maybe we could take a look. At least it'll help calm him down. But wouldn't you gentlemen rather have some tea? [Struggling] [Rodney screaming] [Rodney wailing] [Kathy screams] Oh, my! My lovely wig-pieces all ruined! Rodney, you should just be ashamed, shouldn't he, Napoleon? Oh. [Sobbing] [♪ Soft music] Young man, we owe you an apology. And young lady, you had a close call and we want to thank you for helping us put an end to this monstrous situation. I'm sorry, lady, about your friend. At least we've put an end to these murders. [Sobbing] Lieutenant, what do you suppose will happen to Mrs. Pringle and her son? She seemed like such a sweet old lady, but I'm afraid they'll both spend the rest of their days in the state mental hospital. Come on, let's go make a report. [♪ Sinister drumbeat] Oh, darn. Too bad it's closed. I wanted to buy a wig. Oh, well. Wonder what that is. [♪ Burst of dramatic music]
