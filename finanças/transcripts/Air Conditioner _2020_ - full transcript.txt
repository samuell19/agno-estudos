It's 7:00 am nationwide and it's time for the news here at Radio City 80.8 FM. In this newscast we are going to highlight the rise in heat related deaths and those pertaining to the collapse of air conditioners. The Angolan Association of Refrigeration, Air Conditioning, Heating and Ventilation calls on the Angolan state to help decipher this mystery. This newscast editor is Agostinho Alfredo and Bruno Gonga is our radio technician. I am your host, Andreza Penelas. Stay tuned for the headlines on yours truly Radio City. Greetings. In Malanje, The Angolan Association of Refrigeration, Air Conditioning, Heating and Ventilation... Driver, can you turn up the sound, please? ...calls on the Angolan state to decipher the real causes of the mysterious falls of ACs. Speaking to the press, AARAHV's president Aldemiro Maiato stressed that the country is likely to be facing a conspiracy to insert fans into the Angolan market, considering the bilateral agreement between Angola and China. Next stop, NZamba 2. NZamba 2, Multiperfil. Multiperfil... Two seats left to Multiperfil. Five air conditioners fall off from the fourth floor of a building. Unusual as it may seem, the accident happened yesterday morning near Caála. The aftermath: one dead, three injured, and a damaged Lexus coupe that was parked outside the building and was completely dented. Now, we leave it for three minutes. Listen... My father, before going to sea early in the morning... he would stare at the sea, same as you doing with this mug... waiting for the right temperature. He used to say: "The wind is the almighty. "He tells you everything, Zezinha". I'm talking about real wind, not that air conditioner's breeze. Wind from the sea. From Kianda, goddess of the sea. Yes, boss. - Why is this the AC still not working? - Yes, Dr. Nok. I'm still the boss here. Tell me, why is this not ready yet? - It's done. - Do you know what time it is? - I've been waiting since you went down there. - I went out just for a moment to buy bread. It's hot. Got something to say? - Either it works, or it doesn't. - Yes. Do you understand me? How long I have to wait? I want this air conditioner working. Matacedo will solve the AC problem. I don't wanna hear excuses, I'm tired of excuses. Yes, boss. Am I being loud enough? I want this shit working today. I come back and still have no air conditioning... you had time. Okay. By the end of the day I wanna see this shit ready. - Was I clear? - Yes, boss. I call the shots here, goddamnit! - There's no problem, boss. - How is this possible? Listen, you have until the end of the day to fix this shit. - Are you listening? - Yes, yes. Yes. - Was I clear? - Alright, boss. Bye. Until the end of the day. Bye. It seems as though my bosses have no heart. The way Dr. Nok treats his mother... I think when this lady dies, she won't be mourned. Matacedo, listen to me, family is not just your father and your mother. Did you stop by Mrs. Ana's yet? - Barely. - Barely?! You must spend some time at the mourning ceremony. Or is it that you also think like Dr. Nok? "Mourning is for the hungry person, one who's always scraping for food, booze. "That's who that ceremony is for." Do you feel the same way? Let me just go get this air conditioner. Take out the garbage upstairs. - What's up? - It's all good. Matacedo. Good morning, Matacedo. Listen, I'll be right back. Don't touch anything. Stay put. Not a sound. We have been telling our audience at public TV and radio networks that they ought to be extra careful, avoid risky areas, not walk directly under air conditioners. And we are waiting for the support of the scholars. How can citizens find alternatives to cope with the repercussions? I believe that the first step is to dismiss the entire government. The second step... is to dismantle all air conditioners, those who wish to keep them shall place them on the ground, get rid of all fans. We shall try to implement a social housing policy that is in harmony with the weather conditions of our country. We are always trying to import models from abroad and when things go wrong, we blame it on the foreigners... Matacedo, what are you doing here? My God, didn't I tell you not to move away from the kitchen? Come on, why you do me like that? - This shit still ain't fixed? - Doctor, the ACs are all-- I don't care if everyone else's are falling. Mine can't fall. This shithole doesn't have a coordinator, but it has a president. I run things here. Are we clear? - Okay, doctor... - Let's go. I've told them... On television they said: "If it hasn't fallen yet, it's better to take them down." Many people are dying with air conditioners falling on their heads. Did you see it? I heard. Well, still better than what my mother caught, right? Your father said she's back talking. To say the least. But it took a long time. She got us so scared. I, for one, was already thinking of snatching that African fabric of hers. You have no feelings. It has nothing to do with feelings, I'm just kidding. It's funny, the time she got sick, we were freaking out, walking back and forth. The way her face was left.. We're getting by-- Your mother suffered in this house. Where are the air conditioners that fell this morning? Dunno, I haven't seen jack this time around. You are the one who keeps watch, Matacedo. The one from the boss on the seventh floor was here. Yo, O.G., did you go see aunt Ana? They took some of these air conditioners to the mourning ceremony at hers. You and Zézinha, all the time talking about the dead. What if it isn't there? So, you should holler at the Cape Verdeans. They know everything. It's about the boss's air conditioner. We know. We're stunned that you only came now. And your ear? It's keeping me from falling asleep. We know. The thing you're looking for, you'll find it in a TV set. Follow the fans, and one drop at a time you'll get there. Thanks. - Good Morning, Matacedo. - Good morning, need help? Thanks, it's not necessary. ELECTRICAL EQUIPMENT SHOP, LTD. Mr. Mino? Mr. Mino? - Eh, wrong move. - Hey, this is a bet, avoid the convo. - He's scared. - I ain't scared. That's my move. Hell, if you eat, you drink. - Heh. - Tadaw! - You just lost half. - Finish him. You're in trouble. Killshot. What you up to? Trying to squeeze a tie out of this. Say what? You're facing a pro, dude. Watch me do it. - Dodge him. - Wait. Let me reverse this... Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me? Who is it? It's Matacedo. Matacedo, I was yelling for you down there, been waiting for you since. Take a seat, man, sit down for a second. I got something for you... Food... - There you have it, man. - Okay, thank you. You're welcome. Now go and share it with the others. Please, beware of the ACs. Watch out. Too many ACs are falling. Beware, you are losing weight. - Don't forget to close the door, son. - Okay. - That's proper food right here. - His team is Cambondo of Malanje. - Cambondo? - Ah, don't say that. This is the way you should eat it. - That's a pro move. - Yeah. He's no match. - I'm feasting. - Yeah, nice one. Come on, your turn. - What's up? - Play. What is that? That's soft for me, I'm more into shots of whiskey. Take him out. What does whiskey have to do with food? Just eat and shut up. He thinks he's the man... Bring it on. Look at his hunchback. Look at his hunchback. I cannot accept the way you're treating the Angolan state in this program. Dr. Secretary (of State). Let's keep calm, let's all talk... But you have to soften the language... That's the language of common folk, it's the language of the people who suffer, not the people who live it up, driving fancy over-priced cars in utter comfort, while common folk perishes because an air conditioner fell on his head. You're clearly mixing matters here. Your insensitivity level is... Matacedo? Run slowly, damn it! Matacedo? - Did you see Matacedo? - He's up there. Get out, get out, get out. Show respect to have respect shown I'm a man of talent, as you've come to know Didn't need to show off for this song to blow Puffin on light stuff, cancer's just bad luck Kids are getting jumped, just so they smarten up My role is singing, not jesting or fooling I don't praise myself, I let listeners do it Tito Spyk full of charm, I waste no time, and ring the alarm Let's not forget Lito da Placa If Kuduro was jiu-jitsu, he'd be king of nunchucks Matacedo. Hey, Matacedo. Come, come. You're kidding me, right? It's 4 pm. I want to go home. Where is boss's AC? Boss's AC? Zezinha... - I left it at Mr. Mino's shop for repair. - Hmm...? Mr. Mino's shop? You know damn well that no device ever comes back from that shop-- Don't leave here. Stay right where you are. Sis Juli... I'm coming, my word. Put the beers in the ice, prep those mixed grill stabs, and make sure they're spiced up. I'm coming, I'm almost done, my sister. Wait, wait, wait. You know that shop is like a black hole, you won't get it back. - It'll be ready by tomorrow. - I sure hope so. I want to find that AC at our doorstep, first thing in morning. I don't want trouble with the boss. Understood? I don't want any trouble with the boss. Nuff said. Hey sis, I'm coming. Give us some oxygen. We just craving peace, man. Trapped in obscurantism, in Whateverland. They conditioned most things, even the air we breathe. Lost in thought, old timers ask us why we so fierce Blood, sweat and tears, all you gotta do is let us be. This is the land of grieving folk. Inheritance of the exploited. They gave us lemons we planted an orchard Lost in consumerism, adrift, in dire straits Yo, I'm in my own lane, my words are portraits Real MC's shape things In this promised land where sinners are saints. Kuduro's a war, but not every hole is a trench. Kuduro's a war, but not every hole is a trench. It's the fifth this week. Did you have breakfast? Hey, that ear of yours is hungry. This is what happens when you can't sleep. Or just take a shower. Does a security guard get to sleep? Or bathe? That guy will never recover the air conditioner of the seventh floor. At Mr. Mino's shop? Fought in the jungle, but will fall in the city. Is a war out here. Isn't it, Matacedo? Matacedo… Matacedo… Matacedo… The boss is calling you upstairs. It's officially the coldest season of the year, but still the death toll linked to heat and air conditioner collapse throughout the country continues to increase. Last Thursday, a 93-year-old man walking along Restinga for fresh air tripped over an air conditioner and fell. Local police said in a statement that the man has passed this morning and the cause of death was a heavy blow to the head. The country's 18 provinces are on alert. The Governor of Luanda visited Huíla, one of the coldest provinces in the country, accompanied by a commission of 20 people, working to find out the causes behind the collapse of air conditioners, and control the heat wave. This newscast was brought to you by Agostinho Alfredo, our editor; Bruno Gonga, our radio technician; and myself, Andreza Penelas. Next stop, Cacuaco district. Next stop, Miramar - Roque... Cacuaco district. Mr. Mino? Mr. Mino? It's Matacedo. Next stop, Cacuaco district... Cacuaco district... ELECTRICAL EQUIPMENT SHOP, LTD Mr. Mino? DO NOT ENTER Good morning. Good morning. Come down here and give me a hand. Come down. Come on, there's no time to waste. Excuse me. Come here, hold this. Bring the radio. When the air conditioners began to collapse, I immediately became suspicious. So I found it was time... Mr. Mino? Turn on the radio. Just as the fruits come loose from the branches when ripe. Mr. Mino? Hold here. Give it back. But without trees, what you expect? Everything was much easier when there was only paper to rely on. Now it seems that they make these machines because they're too afraid someone will steal their ideas. Mr. Mino... What you see here… are memories. - Our memories. - Mr. Mino... Look, when the transfer is done, take these over there, and bring those here, okay? Then you must plug this for the sound, there's no memory without sound. And here, this one is for the images, from here to the board, from the board to the TV. Mr. Mino... I just came to get the boss's air conditioner. Only after the transfer is complete and I finish making my soup. Hey, what the hell! Good afternoon, neighbor! What are you doing sitting in front of my door? Sorry for the invasion. I felt the breeze coming out of your home, and I'm just really enjoying it. My house feels like an oven. You're wasting your time, neighbor. Go to Hyper Electro. There are fans for all tastes and pockets... Matacedo, what took you so long? Are you serious? I'm going there right now. Thanks so much for the tip. Tristar Turbo Fans. Say goodbye to the heat indoors. Hey, careful, don't touch it. Look... I found the boss's AC. Come see this. Careful, don't touch it. Come and see. Look... in fact... I cannot explain, but inside... are our memories. What you mean, "our"? Around the hood, there is no air conditioning. So where are you going to get our memories from? Yes, you're right, my daughter... I'm not your daughter. Our memories fell out with the trees. Now, only air conditioners are falling. As far as I'm concerned, it could be you who is damaging the ACs. As far as I'm concerned, it could be the soviets who murdered our first president. Hey, stop. Hey... Behold the future. Look, with this machine I'm piecing together, none of our memories will be left out.

Casuarina seeds. Please bring that air conditioner part over there, quick. I have to work, hurry! Move. Mr. Mino, thanks. Tito, Tito. Hey... leave it, let it be. Yo, I'll eat you alive, man. - I'm the one who will carry it. - Chill, chill. Who got here first? Me, that's who. - But Tito will take it. - No. Tito will do it. - Got that, sucker? - I will take it. Yo, man… you better chill. I will beat you silly and smack you stupid. - Do you want some? - Things can get ugly. I'm telling you, I'll chew you up and spit you out. What's going on? What's the matter, boy? He brought it here, now I'm taking it upstairs. Oh, okay, turn around, carry me, carry me. - Get your hands off me. - Tito, calm down. I chose Tito. Why you tripping? You're such a wanker. Out here fronting, looking like leftovers. Go... Get out my face, go now, you fucking dog. Those kids are something. Did you see how Tito grabbed him? "I will kill you, I will kill you." They're strong alright... - I was there, trying to find a way. - A way of doing what? - To help. - You? I was looking at Tito and thinking to myself: "If this kid decides to grab Matacedo… "His skinny ass would be in trouble..." Hell. All of that for 20 cents. For a mere 20 cents. Why the casuarina seeds? He's a nutcase. These seeds are dry, lifeless, and good for nothing. - It's not madness. - Is what? It's pain. Matacedo, beware. Mr. Mino is a drifter, making up memories of loneliness that only he feels. The same thing happened to my father. My biggest fear was to... drown in my own dreams. I dreamed a lot. I dreamed a lot. I dreamed of the sea. My father... the world across the bay. When they evicted us from Ilha... they took away our lives. I had one last dream. The sea was dry. No water. Only sand, no fish. In my dream, I saw my father, desperate, trying to extinguish the flames of our boat... with sand that slipped through his fingers. I felt everything... but I wasn't seeing things through my own eyes. I saw my dream through my father's eyes. Do you get it? Do you understand? You must go to Mrs. Ana's mourning ceremony. Mrs Ana's pain… is my pain. Unlike these neighbors, crying and moaning, I know what she has lost... We don't go there for that cold body. We do it for ourselves. For our sake. You know that this air conditioner will fall, don't you? I know. When my parents and I return to Ilha, you should come with us. At my age, work in the sea? Matacedo, the sea doesn't know who is old. But I know. If only I can die lying down. That's all I wish. All of us will die lying down. The sad thing is when you have no one to carry your coffin. Zezinha. Zezinha. Zezinha, where you at?
