Central Film Distribution presents FAUST Performed with puppets made by old families of puppeteers Producers, assistants and contributors Scriptwriters Puppeteers Voice-over Artist Artistic Director Editor M S c CeopoeoSe Syeo OceSt a Ceoedcteo Camera Operator Film Director So that you do not forget the legacy of the 1 9th-century Czech puppeteers, so that you can enjoy the wooden figures and the colourful sets, we shall perform a magnificent play about Doctor Johann Faust. First, you will see how the learned Faust kept choosing between good and evil until he signed himself over to Mephistopheles in exchange for fame and power. You will see Faust perform great trick s for the King of Portugal, from where he was chased for being the devil's accomplice and how, later, he cursed Portugal with floods from swollen seas. Finally, you will watch the unhappy Faust haunted by evil dreams and offered repentance, yet succumbing to the devil's temptations and falling into eternal perdition. Watch and listen, the comedy is about to begin. What is Faust doing now? He is still deliberating, whilst life invokes his fate and waits for his decision. Faust is not satisfied with his life. ls he to live like a poor hermit amongst book s in a grim study, or live like a lord, surrounded by beauty, like a rich man with royal powers, like the master of all secrets, a connoisseur of magic? Where does true happiness lie? The moment Faust signs the contract with his own blood, he gets the lightning-fast Mephistopheles and 40 thousand evil ghosts as servants. His fame sweeps through the world as far as the King of Portugal. There, among outstanding artists, Faust displays his necromantic skills. The diversion with David and Goliath hides a devil's illusion. The Queen and the courtiers were petrified with horror. The King himself is speechless. The servant of hell now stalk s the garden as the royal court watches on helplessly. And when evil forces start swarming, the King bares his sword. But the angered Faust shows his might. Later Faust returns home. He indulges in pleasures but finds no happiness, not in silver, nor gold, nor diamonds from lndia, nor merrymaking. Faust is stricken with fear, haunted by nightmares. The doctor awakens from his bad dreams and orders Mephistopheles to make him a picture. The devil again tempts him with evil. Faust, however, in all sincerity wants to repent. Mephistopheles has set a wicked trap and comes now to collect his dues. The end of pleasure is nigh, no mercy upon you, you futile human creature. Faust is alone, abandoned, forever lost. Thus Doctor Faust lost his soul to the darkness of hell. And so ends our play. Good night!
