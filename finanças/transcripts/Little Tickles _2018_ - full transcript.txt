Odette; - Yes; - What are you doing; You draw; - Yes. - It's pretty, tell me! You like it, drawing; - Yes I love that. - It's pretty! - Thank you. - I wish I had a little girl like you... to draw, read stories to him... But I have three boys. They think only to play soccer. I wanted to ask you something, but I'm not too daring. - But if Gilbert, tell me. - Here. You wouldn't want to play doll with me; - Oh yes! More, I have plenty of them. - No wait. Which would be great, it would be that you make the doll and me the little girl. I could dress you, style your hair. It would be funny, no; - Yes maybe. - What's this here; - The bathroom. - The bathroom; - Yes. - We're going to go, okay; But you don't tell anyone. I play with you only because you are all alone. Come on, honey. It's beautiful, your design. - Thank you. - Come. - This is the first time I've talked about this, doctor. It should relieve me; - We are not released, just by revealing his secret to a third party. Even couples... I work mainly with couples, well, not just couples. I have a bulimic too. Besides, why did you come to see me; I treat a couple of friends to you; A colleague; - No. I often go to the station and pass your plaque. So, I came in. - Okay. - Actually, before, I could live without thinking about that and... I've been seeing for some time his face everywhere and I feel his hands. Here. - You suffered a serious trauma, miss. - Odette. My name is Odette. Where the fuck is she; - You said it. I had retained. But you know, miss... - Odette. - A distance from the patient is necessary. The first name is too much... - OKAY... - It's so important, this first name; - Yes. It is the white swan from Swan Lake. - From "Swan Lake"; - Ballet. - Ballet; - Of dance. - Okay. - Tchaikovsky. Odette and Odile, yin and yang, black and white. - Yes, I know. - Odette, like the dying swan. - Usually, I treat less violent cases. Finally, I successfully treated an anorexic. But there I... I'll tell you a colleague who can help you better. - You laugh; I go up to see you, I tell you what I never said to anyone and you send me to a sister; - I am not rejecting you... - You are not rejecting me, madam; - I just want you to be accompanied by the right person. - I won't talk to anyone else. - Okay... - I don't talk much, you know... I dance. Children's laughter Classical piano music - What are you doing; Come on! - Slowly! Gently, girls! You shouldn't run. Ah! Mrs. Le Nadant, you thought about hearing the Conservatory; It's going to be fair for registrations. - We talked about it, but it's not... an easy decision. - She dreams of becoming a ballet dancer. And her name is Odette like the white swan. It's a sign. Laughs Moms, we stop chatting. Ah, but there is a dad! And you are the father of whom; - From Sonia. - Usually, it's mom who comes. - From now on, it will be every other week. - I want to see mom! - Okay. Come on, moms, dads... - You will hurry up tonight, Gilbert is coming to get you. - Gilbert; - Be nice, he gives you gifts all the time. Go to the bar. - Mrs. Le Nadant, I have the registration form. You just have to fill it. Then you have to see, or the boarding school, or a reception house. - We can wait for her to audition. - They will take it, she has quite a talent! - Mrs! - I discuss! Work on the dance of flowers. - YEAH! Cries of joy Softly! Slowly! There, near M. Vincent. Odette, come here. Piano - We're talking about the hearing. - What is it, Benjamin; - Dad says if I do this dance, I'm a girl. - Not at all! Benjamin, the flower, it's the flower, but in the flower, there is the pistil. - The pistil; - This is the big stem that the bees gather to make other flowers. - I'm going to be the pistil; - You can be the pistil. - Girls, I'm the pistil! I am the pistil! Cheers - Why did I say that; Why did I speak of the pistil; Well. Mrs. Le Nadant, think about it but quickly! Lively music But what is he doing to me; Oh, Mr. Vincent! Stop! Stop! Jazz class is Friday, Mr. Vincent! - Well, my Dodette, don't forget, it's Gilbert who's coming. Piano I do not want. I do not want. - You do not want. You do not want. The jury will decide. Place yourself at the bar. She draws. - It's true what your teacher says, you're doing really well. You... You dance like an angel. You will be a star dancer, that's for sure. However, you have to work. There is only work that pays for life. Take off your panties. Come on! Here. It's good. You like you; Yes, you like it. I also quite like. You can pet yourself too, if you want. You know... He is breathing hard. I'm happy, Odette... I am happy. - Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh dear! Thank you for bringing the girl back. - You're welcome. - What a car! - She is beautiful, huh; But Sophie has a face. I'm not working for nothing, shit. - You're right. Come and have a drink. I will pass for a tramp with my BX. - I love him. - With Nico, things are going well; - Very good. Thank you for recommending it to me. He works well. - You need the best for your bar. - Stop it. It is a brasserie. - I cherish you. You offer me a beer; - It's boring, by force. Tell me, I learned. Mom told me about the Conservatory. This is a hell of a thing. Oh there there there there! - It will be useful to rehash all that; - In two sessions, you gave yourself up, that should relieve you. - No. It's not because we talk about it that it passes. - Distance is better... - What; - No it's nothing. But... Yes Yes. It is the beginning of acceptance, of absorption of pain. - I'll put your finger in the eye. - Sorry; - We will see if by saying: "Odette put my finger", the pain passes. No Madam. You will tell yourself that I am stupid and you will cry. - So you passed the audition for the Conservatory. - Yes. Madame Maloc was hysterical. I had my solo at the end of year gala. - Come on. Advanced. Marie, get in place. It's not possible. - But I am placed. - You're in the wrong place. Come on, I tell you. Stop fooling around, Marie. But put yourself on your mark, there! I made you little marks with colored scotch tape. Stop! Where's your scotch; Lift your foot. That's it! If you have scotch tape under your feet, you are well placed everywhere. - That's what I said. - Marie, you tire me. Shut up, please. We take back! Soft music Ah! Mrs. Le Nadant! - Hello, Mrs. Maloc. - You are content; The little girl succeeded. It's not easy to get into the National Dance Conservatory. - It'll make us weird... - Marie! I gave you a mark, it's not a prison. The petals are the moment of the wind. - I see you a lot! - Oh! I am in a movement of creation. I speak like a national scene director. Well. The wind rushes in, making the flower petals shudder. Bees, we place ourselves. Bees, we place ourselves! The flower opens. And be careful, Benjamin... Solo! Dramatic music - I'm the pistil! He screams. I am the pistil! I am the pistil! Screams - Benjamin! - I'm the pistil! - Benjamin, look at me! Calm down. You want to get some air; - No, I'm fine. - Okay, calm down, not to scare your comrades. Go on up! - What happened, Benjamin; - I'm worried, this little one. His mother wants him to audition the Conservatoire. As much for Odette, I believe in it, but he... If he frees himself from his obsessions, he will go far. He has potential. Look. It is Odette's solo in I "'Allegory of Spring". That's wonderful. Classical music Oh! - Oh! - Look! How beautiful she is! - But still anyway, there it flies! - We are insured for that; - That's not the problem, Mr. Vincent. It's natural. She is doing therapy. So she tells of her childhood and she remembers her good memories. - But it scares me. I want her to come back down. - No, don't worry. Fly, my daughter. Fly! And don't forget anything of your beautiful memories. Don't forget anything. Remember everything. Remember everything. It's great, Odette! - My little Odette! - Odette, I have a gift for you. I will miss you very much. This is the poster by Rudolf Nureyev. She had been on the classroom wall for 20 years. It will bring you luck. - Thank you. Children's laughter - I said no to taste behind the scenes! - Mum! - What; I do counting, you bother me. Stop this music, I can't take it anymore. You are leaving for Paris in a week. You don't know what you're taking; You haven't packed your bags; - We have time, mom. - No, we don't have time. It's like it's tomorrow. You do not realize. You just want to get the hell out of your dance. Dance! Dance! There's more to it than dance. It'll make me empty, me, here without you. I recorded you tapes for there. - That's right, mom; - Yes. - You're so nice. - My little Odette. I won't let you go with your old post anyway. - You bought me a new position; - Yes. She laughs. Hey! But all this is expensive, you know. Travel, host family... So, you will not do a year like the 6th. Promised; - I promise. - Come on, put this room away. But you're crazy to put a towel on the lamp; You can burn the house. It's the one Gilbert gave you. What did you wipe with; - I dunno. - What do you mean; - I dunno. - Stop answering me that! - Oh! Mado; Why are you screaming like that; - Look what she's doing gifts from Gilbert. I don't know what she wiped with, it's all sticky. - What are you doing with your towels; - Answer. - I'm sorry, mom. - She apologized, Mado. It's okay, she has... You tidy up your room, honey, please. Okay; - You use it until the end of the week. I'm not here to clean up all day. The phone is ringing. Hello; Ah, Gilbert! - Why are you doing this; - Yes, of course we are working this weekend. I'm going to start a machine. - These are our biggest numbers. - And you tidy up. Okay; I love you. - That's why I help Fabrice at the bar. - Brasserie, please, no bar. - Yes, we're a little selfish. She would be better with you, that's for sure. - Who is it; - Gilbert. They offer to take Odette to the mountains. - Feignasse! It's not going on vacation that you will pay the credit for your car. - Yes, but you know him. - Odette, your mother asked you to clean up your room. - Thank you, Fabrice. I still pass for the wicked one. Yes... Wait, I ask Fabrice. Wait two seconds. So they take it or not; What does one say; - Ask Odette. - No, we are her parents, we decide for her. - I dunno. You decide too much, me, not enough. So do what you want. - How soft you are! Thank you, Gilbert, but no. We keep it with us. Yes, we want to take advantage of it. But thank you very much. Thanks anyway. Kiss Sophie and the boys. - You want to take it; Are you sure; - Yes. - I didn't tell you to tidy up your room; - It's okay, she was going to get started. Why do you do this all the time; I do not understand. I swear, I don't understand you. - I knew it! Where's your dirty towel; - Dad launched a washing machine. - Come. You didn't want to go to the mountains with Gilbert; - No. - Well, you're going to go. She's breathing hard. He is breathing hard. - Ouch! - Hush! Hush! Shut up! Don't make any noise. Odette is crying. Don't cry, Odette. Only babies who cry. - We are going forward. We are going forward. It's more concrete. - It materializes my desire to die, yes. - Why are you whispering, doctor; We are in a memory. There is nobody. - I have to get used to it. It's a bit special as a sensation. - It's okay; - Yes Yes. - Safe; - Yes. So if I follow the timeline, there it is Paris, it is dance, it is fulfillment. - Yes... The development; I don't know if we can say that. - That's good, Odette. - Why he continued; He saw that I didn't like it. - It's a rape, Odette! Come on, let's not stay there. - Here. Warning. - Sorry. It's not too much... - Here. Here! - Ah yes, it's black, black. There would be a way to repaint or... - Ah, that's not possible. I'm sorry. My daughter is in college. It would upset her when she comes back, summer, if we transform her room. - I understand. But this year, it will be Odette's room, during the school year. Therefore... - Ah yes... She can put up her poster. It doesn't bother at all. - I'm going to put my poster of Rudolf Nureyev. - That's it. - I'm hanging it on you; You would have bedbugs; - Not at all. If all the residents make holes... I'll get you some sticky dough. I will be back. - I am sorry. I... We can't afford to find anything better than that, so... It will be fine; - It will be fine. - I saw shops next door. We can buy something... - It's okay. You can leave now. - Don't worry, Mr. Le Nadant, it's going to be fine. Hold. - Thank you. - We are right between the Conservatory and the college. We are 5 minutes away. Eh; You just have to think about closing the shutters, every morning before leaving. - Close the shutters in broad daylight; - Oh dear! Well. We are in the 19th. It's not the best area in Paris, but it's not the worst, either. Come on... It is in good hands. - You will still be careful... Well. See you in a month; - Yes Dad. - I love you, darling. - Me too, dad. Well... Bye darling. - I received a package for you 2 days ago. He's here. Say, we're not forgetting you. She laughs. Come on, I'm going. Settle down and... Hush! No building, eh; - There, Nureyev, it's not top top. You're going to have to help me. A harmonious orchestra Wow! But it's incredible! Applause How beautiful! Where are we there; - We're at the Paris Opera! You thought Nureyev was going to cheer you up in maid's room; Come on, sit down and I dance for you! - I want to see you from above. OK, Nureyev! 5, 6, 7, 8! "Swan Lake" Oh la la la! Tρèc de phew! Wow! Hoots and whistles from the crowd - Miss! Miss! - Kid, I was on to imagine that. - Who are you; WHERE is the girl; - Don't worry Nureyev, I'm coming back as a little girl. We are just in the fantasy of a memory. I can do whatever I want. They never wanted me at the Paris Opera school. - I do not care. - Bastards! It's the only time where I find myself on the stage of the Opera Garnier. So, I take revenge. Asshole of Opera! Hoots Fuck you! - Odette! You are with me there; - Fuck! - Resume from Mrs. Kicheff's departure. We're going astray. I understand your suffering, this need for an imaginary friend... - Who is this fat lady; - He's talking about me; He can see me; - Yes, he can see you, it's not a concrete memory. I said, it's... for fun. - You don't have to make her say what you think of me. I'm not dancing, I'm sitting. Inevitably, we get bored. - When you're fat, you're fat! - You are well-groomed. She's fine. - No. - It's okay! - But I'm dancing there. And double spin! - Let's go back to a concrete memory. - No one is watching. I go back to poster. - Yes it's good. Thank you. Therefore; - "My dear little Odette. "I'm so proud of you "and your desire to become a ballet dancer. "You will be happy, I made arrangements with your parents. "I will come to see you next weekend. "I kiss you very hard. Your Gilbert." Cries of rage Open up. Come on! Hi! My name is Manu. I'm from the building next door. What's your name; - Odette. - And Manu is your neighborhood buddy; - No. Manu, they `re my best friend. He's always been there for me. - It's also your drug supplier, no; - When I needed it. But I tasted it alone. I dived alone. - So what; - You stole it from your little reuf; - How I make my deliveries; - You change activities every week. - I carry you around all week. I'm the driver. - You're going to skate. - Skating; Triple loop in your head! She laughs. Come on, I'm giving you a drink. - That is cool. - I'm a gentleman. - You have money, at least; - What; Money; - Yes. He laughs. - No, as usual, I have no bif. We're making a basketball coffee. - No, my legs hurt, I'm not running. - You gallop faster than me. - No. - The day I start off, I'll really invite you. - Bif to dealer; Always; - You show me; Speak louder. - It makes me drunk that you deal. - I won't deal all my life. - Its good. You force-fed me. - Are you serious; Odette! - I'm serious. - Seriously! Odette! Oh! Don't be a daredevil like that! Whore! Wait for me! I swear, the day I die in rap, we're going to the States. - Nour, Abdel, it's okay; Always the same. - Oh there. Now is the time; - We take the time. - Wesh, guys. - Go ahead, bastard! - Spin, please. - Bastard! - He thinks it's the street to his father. - Cool, here we are. - You got the weed; You got that where; - In Amsterdam. We left with Abdel. We were sold a piece of phew. - What; Rap music - I'll explain it to you. You shouldn't get caught by the guys with that. OKAY; It's hero. - You're phew, this is hard drugs. - In spikes. If you smoke it, you sniff it, that makes you feel good. - I don't touch that, guys. No. - OKAY. But you, with all your anxiety attacks, that even shit, you don't care, I tell you, with the hero, it will put you well. You will dance like a fool, in your conservatory with the buds. Try it. - Brother, she has a real life. She is not a galley slave. - Leave her. Rap Music - Odette, if you try, I try. - Go ahead. There is nothing to lose. Damn, it's windy! You either have the balls or not; Urban music with tribal percussion - Here! Here! There, that's it. There, that's it. Exclamations of admiration Wow! You felt emotion there; It's strong! - It's cool. - No no. I rarely say it, it's very strong. - It's great fun. - In terms of emotion, you gave us one thing... There was no technique, but there was emotion. - No technique; - No. It is not serious. What I'm looking for here, here, it's emotion. There I had it. She was there. And that's what I want in this workshop. I'm not talking about technique. Here we are... in the destructured, in the... There is, there is. But after 4 years, we tell ourselves that we will have a higher level. And in 5 years, we can dream, we will have the emotion and the technique. Uh... I asked for a dance on a state of being. The state of being that Odette presented to us... You can stop with that, it bothers me. You proposed us the state of being a little girl. - Yes that's it. - That's it; And this state of being is suffering. Here. She is a suffering little girl. And the suffering of this little girl, it's the Holocaust. - What; - You are part of a family story or rather... - Not at all. It's... - No, no. Excuse me, we don't want to know. I ask questions... We are not here for that. You played an emotion, you gave it to us. - I just... - No, no. If you want, you can talk to your classmates later. You know that... You know your name; - Odette Le Nadant. - Ah! This, you see, is post-traumatic amnesia. Often precisely, on the return from the camps, there was this silence, which can be hereditary and reproduced, reproduced. You know you are Jewish; - No, I'm Breton. - Ah there, that's it. There have been very few Breton Jews and very few have returned. We understand suffering better. Thank you for sharing this moment with us, Odette. Muffled laughter We have little time left. If someone wants to pass, but then run. Benjamin... - Morning. Hatching. Petals. - Okay, Benjamin, let's stop. Its good. Benjamin! Benjamin! - Pistil. - Benjamin, you stop. Anyway, the time has passed. See you next week. Odette! You stay. I need to talk to you. Come back. I wanted to tell you, your dance is strong, it is powerful. But you have to get out of your fog. You told someone about it; - I don't know, I have nothing to say. - You don't want to tell someone about it; - I don't know what you're talking about. I can go; - Yes Yes. - Thank you. It lasts 10 years. - I heard, huh. - Yes Yes. It shook you less this session. - I'm not the one who has to feel. - I just told you about my drug dive. Nothing serious. - No, but we're moving on. We are going forward. Uh... It's already 6:05 p.m. - OKAY. There is an obese who gets impatient; - There is no little pain. - I'm kidding. It can't be seen too much, but I like to laugh. - You may know her... Two Lacanians meet. The first one says hello. And he is very upset, he finds that he has said too much. But the other one is also annoyed, he wonders what that means. She laughs. Uh... We're going to make an appointment for next week. - No I think not. No Madam. It's not because of the joke. It's just that it's better. Much better. And I just auditioned. I got the job, I'm going on a international tour for a year. It will allow me to distance myself from my past. - And on your return; Your past; - Well, he will have forgotten me. - Well... - Thank you very much because... this is the first time anyone has listened to me. - Have a good trip, Odette. I am there when needed. - OKAY. - I did the Conservatory. - Ah yes; - I'm not getting used to this bush on your head. Sorry. - Stop, girls, what! - You are the bearer of the gush of nature! - This training to do "Poui Poui and the magic tree". - At least you're in the title. Stop or we send you to the guys' lodge. - No, they're fighting, it's childish. - It's still missed. - You missed it. - Thank you. Alice, you can help me; - Ah yes. - You're still in pain; - Yes, the trapeze. You make up for it too well! - Mom has been on the road for 18 years, so... -18 years old! How old are you; - You want to know; Top secret. She laughs. - In absolute terms, she is young. Except that at 40 years old in dance, you're at the end of your career. - You're not cool. - I confirm to you. My knees are screwed up. It's time to stop. I see that I get older when my 15 year old daughter has her period. -15 years old, it's normal. I got them at that age, it's late. - But it's my baby, it will remain my baby. - The conversation disgusts me, I'm going to have a water fight. - That's it. - Good battle! - What are you doing; What is this blood; But my baby, you have your rules; Oh, my little darling! My Dodette, you have your rules! It's not true! But it's crazy, you're so small! Eh; You're barely 10 years old, anyway! You have no hair, no chest, nothing. That's crazy! I got my rules very late, at 17-18 years old. It's late. It's weird that you got them so early. It must be mineral water. I saw a report on it. It develops progesterone and it advances puberty. You understand what that means; No; You do not understand; Oh dear! I will never get her back. Honey, when you wash panties, with blood, you have to put cold water. Hot water cooks the stain. There, I can do nothing more. It's okay, but you should have told me about it. It's okay to grow up and be a woman, you know. My baby who becomes a woman... It makes me weird. It makes me very weird. Okay, come on, I'm throwing it away. - Mom, I have to tell you... - We're going to see the gynecologist; - No! - No; You do not want; When we have our rules, we will see the gynecologist. But if you're not ready, let's wait a bit. We're going to go buy sanitary towels. We don't say anything to dad, okay; Come on. Wash your hands. Let's go. Little screams Moans - You are rabbits or what, lovers... Ah yes, it's not Sylvain! - Lola! You say nothing to Sylvain. It's just that we took mushrooms. We're kidding. - It's super funny. - It suits you that Sylvain is free. - What you fear! "Romeo and Juliet - The Kings of the World" - - It's okay; - Yes and you; - Who is he; He's not in the troop. - The hotel watchman. - And then what; - We can be together tonight. - Let go of me. Change nothing. - Relax. Hey! - Who is it; Cheers - Thank you. You're on "Les Dix Com"; - It's not "Les Dix Com", it's "Aladin". - We will make egg puffs! Eggs! Coke! Coke. - Hush! - Ah, old woman! She laughs. - I don't age, I mature. You are like that; - Argentina. Beach. Caipirinhas. - In the southern hemisphere. This is winter. - Go ahead, go instead of me... - Stop. - Get out! Get out! Stuck to me! - What do you have; - I'm disapointed! Go away! Go away! You are like everyone. Go away! Shut up! Go ahead, go ahead or I'll put one! Fuck you all! - The farm! It's okay! Let's go! - What are you doing; You're in "Romeo and Juliet" costume! "The Ten Commandments" There, it's "The Ten Com"! Send. Yes. - Two shows, one production, I had to gut myself one day. - She got the wrong costume. Ah, I swear to you! Send. Top! Its good. - We do not care. I'm sure Capulets have crossed the Red Sea. - Come here! Electronic music - I'm sleeping in the truck. - We don't go to bed. We never decide to go to bed. We never fall! - It's okay; She coughs. They sing "When The Saints Go Marching In". - Come on, everyone's coming down! - Wait for me! Oh! What's this here; - We're in Roubaix, Dracula. - Yes. Great. Brouhaha of the dance company Ah! "Rabbi Muffin" Lola, we go out tonight or not; - No, I have friends this evening. We just returned to Paris. You have no friends; - I have no one left. For 4 years, on the roads. - The tour; It's not the high that isolates you; - How are you mom; - Odette, he is saving to talk about what happened to you. Yes. You have to assume it until you admit it. She's crying. - I have nothing to confess. I did not do anything. - Sorry. Sorry. It's true, it's not the right word at all. To reveal it, to say it. - Tell it to whom; To my parents; - For example, yes. - You've cracked. Sit on the chaise longue. You think I'm going to spoil my parents' lives while Miguié is their friend; - Still today; lt is always part of your life; - They're on the same street. He is a pastry chef and my parents have a bar... a brasserie. It is a small city. We do not say so. - You inflict yourself on seeing him again; - I grew up, he's more interested in me. A scooter passes. - Fuck, I knew it! I knew it! I always knew it, Odette! Today, I would burn him, I bugger his mother! - I know, Manu. - Whoever does this to my daughters, I smoke it! You want me to smoke it; - No. - I'll smoke it! Now I can. At the time, I was too small. - Hey, hey, hey! Oh! Reuf! It's ok now. It's okay. I'm fine. It's okay. OKAY; Its good. - Yes; Its good; That's why you cry when you get high; Don't take me for an idiot. Whore! It doesn't go like that. - I know, reuf. I know. I know. I am late. - You are late. - Cute, your colleagues! - You're a phew, you're too good for them. Bang! - What I like when you dance! - No. Come. - On my mother's head, we will take this trip to the States. - Hey! We will be going to Los Angeles! - What will we do; - The dance of anger, what. - Hey, Zoulette! I'm here for you! - Hello. Nice to see you. Come. Let's go. I'm Luce, Jacky's colleague, the warehouse manager. It's for its starting pot. He's a rugby fan. We said to each other with colleagues, a dance with 3 pretty girls in rugby, to give him the gift, it would be great. - There is another gift; - Yes. Two tickets for a XV match at the Stade de France. So we called... - Lola. - It's you; You made the Christmas tree last year. - That's it. - That's it; I loved it! It helps to keep in touch. If you want to cool off a bit later. It's a surprise, be discreet. Jacky is drinking coffee up there. We will meet in 5 minutes; I will start the music. You go there. Its good; It has to dance, it has to laugh. If you can stick together a little. May he be embarrassed. - We're used to it. - See you soon. I look forward. - Fuck, the big loose! - You're at the Palais des Congrés, every night, it's good. - We do not care.

It lasts a year, it's in 6 months. I dunno. - You didn't tell me about it. - I was going to do it. - It's a great company. You always wanted to dance with them. - It's up to Odette to make the decision. Finally! This is great news. - Especially if she doesn't go. - But I'm proud to have succeeded. Even if I don't, it's fine. - Excuse me. It is forbidden to smoke. - You accompany me; - Of course. See you later. - I'm very proud. It's beautiful. - Yes. Thank you. I did not know. You know it since when; - Fifteen days. - Fifteen days, damn! 15 days that you pretend nothing. - No that's not true. It's not that. First, you learned it in a bad way. You know, it's my job to audition. - I know that. - You see; - That's not what hurts me. What hurts me is that you don't tell me. I made the video. I looked like a jerk. - No. It was great. - And there I am invisible. I am told nothing. - It's not true. It's just that... Why are we talking about that; We spent a boring evening. - Very boring! Your mother still runs your life; - Don't talk about her, please. - She's unbearable. - It's just that I didn't want to worry, that's all. - It's just that... It is by hiding things from me that you can lose me. - I can lose you; - No I... - You're telling me that I can lose you; I thought we were stronger than that.

What the hell are you doing to me? - Look at you, we're the same. The same violence. It was bullshit, your whole notion of happiness, your little life teddy bears and all. You're a liar. Come on, we're going back, we're going to make love. - No it's OK. No I can not. I am tired. I'm tired of enduring it all. Drop it. - What's the matter; Stopped. - I don't want to wonder if you'll wake up next to me. if you are going to want me, if you're not going home drunk, when we had to spend the evening together, you go days without knowing. I do not want. There I am... Phew! I'm snorkeling, damn! Since I got to know you, I've been snorkeling. I'm breathing more there. I don't want that. - Stopped. - No, I don't want that.

I thought you were fine. I do not understand. You had passed a course, you started to digest your pain. And in the face of love, you freeze. - I was not going to tell the one I love about the rapes I suffered. He would have run away. - You are wrong. - And he left. - When you love, you can hear it. - No, it's a fairy tale, that. In real life, it's not like that. - And now, what are you going to do; - I'm going to get some fresh air. Go ahead, Manu! We tear ourselves away! We're going into our kids dream, damn it! - Odette!

I'm talking about you, you're my reuf. Don't worry, as you speak in verlan, the psychiatrist understands that slab. Laughs - You tell me like a guy... a caricature which speaks in verlan; - I'm telling rotten memories. I have to make her laugh. - I admit that your life is gratin. If you don't make her laugh... But that's what makes you laugh; - I don't know, your face, your delirium, your face... our kif. - You blew a lead; - What happens to you; - What are you talking about your shrink; - What are you doing; Loosen your thong. - Where's your shrink; - Fuck, but... - Where is she; - The session has not started.

He has been coming to our house like a brother for years. We trust him. And he rapes my daughter! He rapes my daughter before my eyes, damn! He continues his life as if nothing had happened. He comes to our house. He comes to eat, quiet. We are going on holidays. He comes for coffee every morning at the brewery. He considers me his friend. While he rapes my daughter! - It's okay. Calm down. We will not draw hasty conclusions. We... I don't see him as a pedophile. He has everything for him. He is beautiful, he succeeded. There is nothing perverse. I do not understand. - Okay, Mado. What does a pedophile look like? How does it work; How does one dress, a pedophile; You know it; No, you don't know. It can be anyone. That's why I got smoked! - Odette... Are you sure; - Mado! - Drop it. Its good. I should never have told you. - We believe you. - Of course we believe you. We can still speak, no; But we believe you. But hey, since he was very close to you, maybe... - But hey, what; But hey, what; What; Maybe what; Go to the end of your idea. Express yourself. Tell me what you think. - Maybe you interpreted his gestures... - Interpreted! Are you kidding me; You think I'm lying; - I said you were lying; - You're implying it! I do not lie! - We can talk to you; You give us the information... - You accuse me of lying! - I'm not saying you're lying, but these accusations are serious. - I know it's serious! I'm not inventing! - Mado! What is serious is what he did. Okay; All these gifts and I saw nothing like an idiot! - Well yes, we can't imagine such a thing. We have to settle this between us. We're going to go see Gilbert and we're going to talk to him. - I'm going to kill him. - No, don't be silly. - I'm going to kill him. - It's okay, we understood, you're going to kill him. She sighs. Like we need this. And people... How they will react, people; - And me; Me! - Sorry, my Odette. Sorry. Sorry. She's crying. I hide behind this word because if not, I swear to you, I kill him. I don't know what else to say... Sorry. Sorry... I love you so strong. She sobs. My life is behind me now. You know; But you are in front. You are only in front. I want you to always have my forgiveness in your head, that you hear it all the time, that it sounds, that you know your father told you that he would always be with you. Okay; Come on. I love you. - Thank you dad. What are we doing; What does one say; - We say sorry. - Sit down. - Thank you. - Sit down. - It's a complaint for what; - You're crazy, you. - For sexual violence. - A tuna-mayo; - Ham butter.

He is called Gilbert Miguié. It is done. - Yes. - It was not a question, rather a statement. I didn't know we were so happy to send someone to the slaughterhouse. - The slaughterhouse; I filed a complaint. - Ah yes; I heard them: "We're going to be Miguié!" You call it a complaint; It's more like bullfighting. - Because he's a repeat offender. There were other complaints. It's just that... there was no penetration for others. - Spare me the details. We are going to be entitled to a trial. And there, I'm not ready. - He must be tried. You don't think you have to... Mom... And the binoculars; You think of binoculars; You think about it; - And Sophie; You think about Sophie; The pedophile granny, you think about it; You think that after that, her daughter-in-law will give her the little ones; And Guillaume; What is she going to say to his wife, about her husband; Maybe he's like his father, that pedophilia is genetic. You thought about it; No. - Mom, I can't do this alone. I need your love. I need you. - You need our love; Is that so; It is you who let us go for the dance. You sometimes come back to dazzle us with your conquests and your travels. Feet under the table. Mama's beef bourguignon. A weekend, by the pool, at the expense of the princess. And recharged fully, miss leaves. And now you tell me that you need our love; The two morons who saw nothing, nothing at all... Oh fuck! Oh, Miguie loaned us money! Eh yes!

Odette blows. - Miss Miguie, you are testifying against your brother, Gilbert. You know, your complaint is not admissible, the prescription on sexual violence, being fixed at 20 years after the majority. However, The Attorney General insisted that we hear you. You will take the oath. - Uh... - "I testify in my soul and conscience." - I testify in my soul and conscience. - "I swear to tell the truth." - I swear to tell the truth. - "The whole truth, nothing but the truth." She repeats. Raise your right hand and say "I swear". We are listening to you, madam. - Miss. I never had a sentimental life. I can't do it. He took everything from me. You know that, Gilbert, that you took everything from me; My body, my self-esteem... my life. Look at me. I was 12 years old, Gilbert! I was 12 years old! And you fucked me! I was 12 years old and you fucked me! Pedophile! - Prescription! And it's a minor misappropriation. - Violate, it is not serious; He fucked his sister! - Miss Miguie, please. - Sorry, I'm vulgar. - Go for it. Carry on. - And you, you realized nothing; You've been married to him for 20 years, you haven't seen anything; All these victims; You have to believe that money helps to keep quiet. I'm still in pain, Gilbert. I feel you climb on me every day. When I wake up, when I fall asleep... you're there on me. You stole me. You emptied me. Where is it, the prescription for my terrors; - I never forced her, little one. She was as silent as a carp. We don't force people. When we don't want, we don't want. She wanted. She liked it. Even it's ... It was you who took your panties, Odette. So... she offered herself to me. You had to... What; That I refuse; I do not understand anymore. Sad music "Little girl" Little girl, you swing And when you dance, your dress swirls Little girl, so quiet When you remove your makeup Little girl, you are my daughter Tattooed with my intimate worries Nightmares, daggers of all my nights The drums will sound almost midnight "Little girl" Tell me Why you are no longer here - No mother... I don't invent pain to exist. Why did you come; - My darling, the lady had to hear another version. Besides, what do you still do with a shrink; You won. Gilbert was 7 years old. What else do you want; - I would like us to reconstitute. - There is nothing to reconstruct. Just notice the damage. Your father, he's in contrition... And me... I can to smoke a cigarette; - Yes. Rather, there. - Okay. - Mrs. Le Nadant, it is important that you resume the dialogue with Odette. You came, it's already a great step. You are open to an exchange. - I'm here for the Salon du Brasseur. As Odette insisted that I come... - Mom, I really need to talk to each other. Listen to me. Listen to me. - Let go of me! You're going to piss me off for a long time with this; All that for fingers in the pussy, licks. You know what I have experienced in life; So stop pissing me off! Lying in the assize court to hurt me! You are going to go up to where; How far are you going to go; - It's okay; You've finished; You know what I really wanted; Take me in your arms and tell me you're sorry. That's all. I was this little girl. I abandoned it and so did you. You don't think we dwell on certain pains. But it's not your pain, it's mine. You can say that I lied, that it's not true, it doesn't matter, I do not care. I know, I know what I suffered. And today, I want it to come out. I don't want to live waiting for death. You understand; Can you understand; Excuse me, doctor, I have nothing more to do there. Odette; - Yes; - You draw; - Yes. - You like it, drawing; - Yes I love that. - What are you pretty! I forgot you were so pretty. - Do you know me; - I knew you well, yes. - What's your name; - Odette. - My name is Odette too, like the white swan... - of the Swan Lake. - I will become a great star dancer. - You know, Odette, there are many paths, many. But you will become a good person. She's crying. I promise. I would like to ask you something. You would like to come with me; - Yes, I've been alone for a long time. - I know... I know, my dear. Forgive me. Sorry to have abandoned you all these years. It wasn't your fault. You had nothing to do with it, in fact. We will never leave each other again. Okay; You come; "Happiness" Don't be afraid of happiness It doesn't exist Neither here nor elsewhere Tadida dida, dadida We will die tomorrow Don't say anything Marital happiness Will remain local crafts Let yourself go Time for a kiss I will love you The treasure is not hidden It's right there At our feet, unveiled He would almost make us fall It's harmful that we don't live Only once It's a time of joy Who offers himself like you to me Let yourself go Time for a kiss I will love you A little salt in the sea Won't change anything We adore ourselves, we bury ourselves We find a hand and we shake Don't be afraid of happiness It doesn't exist Let yourself go Time for a kiss I will love you Let yourself go Time for a kiss I will love you Children's voices Subtitling: HIVENTY
