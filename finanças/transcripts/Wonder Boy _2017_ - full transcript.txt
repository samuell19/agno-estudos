Wo-oh wo-oh, Chao Fan, baby Chao Fan Chao Fan, baby Chao Fan - Chao Fan, baby - You're my Chao Fan, baby Time to eat! Baby Dad, eat. Mom, eat. What kind of music is that? Dick! Chao Fan, baby Dick! You're my Chao Fan, baby Stop. Come and set a good example. If I knew you would be banging non-stop I wouldn't have made you take lessons. I've stopped anyway. I'm going to be a pop star. Pop stars are all drug addicts. Who said? See this? That's why they're all banned. But that doesn't mean that they all... You just finish school and then come and help me in the office. No thanks. Don't be rude, eat your dinner. And this weekend, go and have a haircut. You look like a drug addict. Why so grumpy? I hate my life. Because you can't be Elton John? Shut up! Tomorrow is my first day in this new class, okay? I just want to make a good impression. A very good impression of a four-eyed skinny cockroach! - Get out! - Don't oversleep, okay? If you're not in the car on time, I'm leaving without you. May I remind you that the government has banned rock concerts and long hair like this on males. I have noticed an increasing number of boys with guitars glued to their backs. I want to emphasise that we do not encourage the playing of rock music in this school. - If you get caught by the police - Brother! on the street they will send you for a haircut. St. Peter's Institution upholds a clean image and so in accordance with the government's policy we will proceed with our monthly hair check. Now, the Talentime for schools is coming up. And Saint Peter's has been selected to host the heats and semi finals. I do not expect to hear any rock music entries from you. Don't love me for fun, girl Let me be the one, girl Love me for a reason Let the reason be love Don't love me for fun, girl Hey! What do you think you're doing? - What? - You have enough hair to sit here? - I... - This... is the "got hair" zone. And there... is the "no hair" zone. Hey, Sammy, let him sit where he wants.

We'll wait here for a while then. This is so dangerous! Danger follows me everywhere. Bullshit. Think that's dangerous, you wouldn't survive half a day in my house. Why? Wait till you meet my dad. Your dad is dangerous? What would he do to me? Throw you out the window. Chase you around the house with a belt. And throw anything he can find at you. Why would he do that? Most of the time he's just too drunk to think. Your mom? She's not around anymore. Don't tell anyone what I told you, okay? Of course. I wouldn't want my dad to beat me up too. It's not a joke. I trust you not to tell anyone. Thank you. The coast is clear. You sure? Let's get out of here. Why don't you go and concentrate more on your studies? Your "O" Levels are coming soon. And you're still hanging around with those hooligans. We are in the Talentime finals. I don't care what you're in. Just make sure you pass your exams. - You hear me? - Yes, I heard you. Why do you always disobey him? Are you trying to drive him to his grave? Then why doesn't he listen to me? He is your dad! So what? He doesn't understand me. No one understands you. Anyway, his business is not doing well. And all our expenses have gone up. So can you please... Can you please try harder? Hello? Hey. Why are you calling me so late? My family is sleeping already. Yeah, my dad too. I'm bored. Can't sleep? And I feel like talking. Okay. What are you doing? I'm... writing a song. Why do you write songs anyway? Because I can. You arrogant bastard. You know, someday, I hope we can sing my songs. You're such a dreamer. No, I'm serious. You should hear this one I'm writing. Sure, okay, one day. Hey, Mark. I... I've kind of written a song for you. You wrote a song for me? Hey, my dad just woke up. Got to go, bye. Hello, Mark? Talking it over just the two of us Working together day to day Together Where the hell is Sammy, man?

You look fine. Thank you very much, Candy. And now, please welcome our final contestants The Wonder Boys, with In The Morning. Let's win this. In the morn...

Look, I don't care, we don't care, okay? Anyway it's over now. Hey. What's over? Us. The Wonder Boys. Why? Yeah, you guys are good, you can still go on. - Not good enough. - 'Cause all we ever did was sing covers. Here we go. At least we could have tried... To sing one of your precious songs? Yes, I get it, but we didn't. - No, what I mean is... - I know what you mean. Maybe you should go do your own thing with your songs. I'm just trying to speak my mind. Brother, don't be such a jerk. Like I said, it is over. I'll see you around. Mark, wait! Come, let's go. We're not good enough to sit with this genius. Why are you like this? Like what? Talented? Your exam starts this week? Have you been studying? No. You smell like you just came back from the temple. What temple? It's his cigarettes. What? Smoking? Do you want to die? Relax, everyone is doing it. - It's no big deal. - Stop smoking and study hard for your exam. Study for what? So I get to be stuck in that boring office just like you? Forget it. What do you mean "forget it"? How are you going to survive if you don't pass? Don't worry. I won't die. If I said, from the heart I feel lost, when apart From my brother, my superman What would you say? Hello? Who is this? Is Mark there? He's not in. Who the hell are you? I'm his friend. Do you know what time is it? Friend? Sorry. Don't call him anymore. Richard. Hey! I was trying to... What did you write to me? What did you write in the letter? Why did you send it to my house? You didn't read it? My father opened it. You know what he gave me? Mark... He said a homo sent me a love letter. What else did you write? I told you to keep it a secret, right?

The public's not interested in local compositions... Anyway, it's good to see you. Yeah, same... Okay... I know I was a jerk. No, it's not that. It's just that you remind me of Pat. And I remember someone said he could win the Talentime all by himself. And that was the jerk speaking. But I really believe you can do it. I don't. Yeah, I saw this today. Look! No, I'm done with Talentimes. But you haven't tried it on your own before. I don't know. Come on, give it a shot. It's time to play your own music. Hello? Hello! We're too late.

And this is a song that I wrote called Life Story. Wake up she said Look, it's a beautiful day Downstairs to the kitchen door And then away Into the light Morning feeling lives on Come the clouds and moon And morning is gone Born today, some years ago And had a happy childhood But I fell in love and out Nothing's changed Lived a life of nothing much But then, how much can one expect But there you are, my life has passed But I'm the same Just my life story Minute by second A story that goes on forever With each breath that I take This is my life story Uneventful-lest story That ages with each year and birthday cake Oh my god! You're Vernon Cornelius! - Yeah, hi! - I'm such a big fan of The Quests! Good to know. Hey Dick, how old are you? Seventeen. And you say you wrote the song. Yes. By yourself? I am not gonna put you on Talentime. I guess you prefer covers. No. Actually, on the contrary, I think you're quite special. Even if I put you on the Talentime, you might not win. Even if you do win, you're just gonna go join another contest. So, what I'm going to do is... I am going to make you a guest artist. Thank you. But why? See, this way, you get to come out every week.

Very wise That is what I would do If I were you Whenever I am feeling low I look around me and I know There's a place that will stay within me Wherever I may choose to go I will always recall the city Know every street and shore Sail down that river which brings us life Winding through my Singapore This is home, truly Where I know I must be Where my dreams wait for me Where that river always flows This is home, surely As my senses tell me This is where I won't be alone For this is where I know it's home When there are troubles to go through We'll find a way to start anew For there's comfort in the knowledge That home's about its people too So we'll build our dreams together Just like we've done before Just like that river which brings us life There'll always be Singapore This is home, truly Where I know I must be Where my dreams wait for me Where that river always flows This is home, surely As my senses tell me This is where I won't be alone For this is where I know I'm home
