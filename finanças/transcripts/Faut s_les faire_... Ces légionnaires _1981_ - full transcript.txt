Shut the door! Ouch! Done! Shut the door! Darn it… Oh, no! - Jacques Philippe? - Yes? - You're fired! - What? THE SANDWICH MAN RESTAURANT AND DELI Hi, love. - Did it work? - Perfect. I got a one-year contract as an ad creator. Awesome! They even gave me an advance. Here. Order whatever you want. Garçon! Champagne! You're crazy, I've had tooo much. We're celebrating, sweetheart! A toast to our love. I'm getting you drunk, aren't I? Will you excuse me a moment? I'll be right back. Shit… It's him, go! Ouch! Shit! A witness! Kill him! Shit! Excuse me, do you have a fire exit out back? This way. Jacques? Why are you dressed like that? Don't move. What's your boyfriend's name? Do you have any room left? - Yeah, get in. - Thanks! This is our pork dish, with raw vegetables. - Gérard, please serve. - Thank you. - Maître d'hôtel! - What is it? This is unbelievable! This is outrageous, that cart - is ours! - Indeed. I'm sorry about that. Leave it. My apologies, sir. Sorry. OK… Alright. I'm sorry, sir. We didn't order this! My apologies again. Sorry. I'll be right back. Has that idiot waiter lost his mind? I'm sorry, sir, this has never happened before. Gérard, please come here. - Why us? - What happened? Come with me. I've never seen such a thing! Thank you. - Your dry Martini. - Thank you. - Is everything in order now? - Yes. I'm glad to hear it. It wasn't that bad, right, sweetheart? Get out. Get out! Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, ma'am. I'm so sorry. Sorry. - Easy. - Sorry, I don't know… There. - Stop. - Sorry. There. What a dumbass! He's fondling my wife's breasts! What's the meaning of this? Please stop this! - Darn it! - I see! Ladies and gentlemen, your meals are on the house. - As for you, Gérard… you're fired! - No! - Nice customer service! - No! I never thought we'd ever be able to marry her off. Our money erases her ugliness, my dear. What a beautiful, rich, wedding. We would've had to kiss our factory goodbye. Miss Pierrette, do you accept to marry, before God, Mr. Daniel Kiapt? Yes, yes, yes! I do! Mr. Daniel Kiapt, do you accept to marry, in the presence of God, Miss Pierrette? Well, I mean… Daniel! Well, I… - So? - But… Well? Yes or no? Well, no! My love! My love! Good Lord… Dédé! Dédé! Wait! - It's going to be OK. - Stop that. It'll work out, I promise. - You should be ashamed, son. - Yes, Dad. Fifty years in the beret industry. Generations of our family in the beret industry. Sacrifices for the beret industry! Long live the French beret! And all I get is a son who rejects the beret industry? Dad, I have other plans! Jean-Marie! Jean-Marie… My boat! Where are you going? - To Africa. - This one was waiting for you. But it'll cost you! Come with me. Have a nice trip, nutjob! Sweetheart! Let's go! Sweetheart! Dédé… - Let's hit the road! - Hey! Hurry it up! Let's go! Get in! Hit it! Sweetheart! Sweetheart! Step on it! Step on it! - How did she get here? - Ever heard of planes? - Gérard. - Jacques. Daniel. Ah! Let go! - Hello! - Go! Have a nice life! Well, girls, it's not very crowded around here. This isn't going to be very much fun. I just realized there aren't any clothing stores! What are we going to wear? This guy's something else! You think like a chick! That's not true. - No way… - Unbelievable! Get off and gather in the yard! Hello, this is Colonel Berger. From Paris? Put him through. Excuse me, young man, do we get our own bathroom? Come on guys, we have to get inside. You don't know? Oh, well… - Daniel, are you coming? - I'm coming! This is a state matter. We were surprised during an operation by a troublesome witness. According to our sources, he's wearing a legionnaire's uniform and is going to the desert. Is he one of the new recruits? What's his name? Jacques? Philippe. - Perfect. - He cannot get away. I'll take care of him, Minister. Colonel, the new recruits have arrived. I'll be right there. I don't trust that Colonel. I'd feel better if you went there. Very well, sir. On my order! Attention! How do they look? Like newbies, Colonel. Soldiers, from now on, you're are part of the Legion, you no longer belong to yourself, have girlfriends or friends. Your only girlfriend is now the Legion. Your only friend is the flag. Legionnaires are the most… disciplined soldiers, Colonel. You've been here before? No, Colonel. Some of you think you're here on vacation. Some of you will try to shoot the breeze. The Legion will subdue them. If the Legion can't, the desert will. If the desert can't, the vultures will. And if the vultures can't… I'll do it myself. I don't know what's worse for you. Dude, this isn't the time. Adjutant. Take attendance. Sargent! Attendance! Reginald Jean Gérard! Here! Hans Von Richstaffen! Kawasakanoff! De Bonnier Angerran! Here! Ahmed Ben Mohamed Chali! Xiat Daniel! Here. Philippe Jacques! That's me! Alfred Meunier! Here! Peter Van de Reijt! - Julien Kleubloche! - Here. Silence! Silence in the ranks! Look! What the hell? Hello, how are you? I've come from Geneva. What a great sandy place you have here. What's this nonsense? Take care of it. Your name! Menu, Mr. Soldier. Silence in the ranks! Go get your uniforms! Get a move on! - It's a bit tight. - I don't care! Don't worry, honey. I'll do your touch-ups for you. What about the Swiss boy? Cracking under pressure! I'll tell you the combination in case I forget. Hello, Bank of Geneva, please. Dad? It's Eddy! I made it. Yes. Oh, there's sand everywhere. I have a problem with my suit. Oh, my measurements? Sure, hold on. Wait, I'll take your measurements! Well, that's a fat Swiss bee! Hold on. Are you crazy? What about drafts? He's nuts! Look sharp for the Colonel. Looking sharp for the Colonel! Everything off. Next. That'll change a man! Those who already had their haircut, put your hats on! Forward, march! Soldiers! You're looking at an SMG. An SMG is a submachine gun. The SMG is made up of three parts. The first, the second and the third. Nothing is easier than dismantling an SMG. Remove the magazine. That's it. Everyone got it? Any questions? How do you put it back together? Good question! Good question. Very easy. Grab the SMG, stick the breech in, and push its behind - to slide it in. - Oh! Then put the spring in. Push the cap all the way in… A ten-year-old child could do it! Bring a child in! You just have to put the central assembly into the system. And push back. So you can bring forward the left part of the mechanism, while giving a thrust to the right side towards the erection… ejection chamber! Oh my… Gently replace the magazine… Don't worry, they're blanks. Get up, wimps. Parasites. Despicable! In the yard! Hurry up! Get ready! At my command! One, two! One, two! One, two! One, two! Faster! One, two! One, two! One, two! One, two! One, two! Faster! One, two! Faster! One, two! One, two! Faster! One, two! One, two! One, two! One, two! Hurry up! There! Is that good? Get moving! Lie down, gentlemen, lie down! Keep moving! Not that way, don't wimp out on me! Let's go! Let's go! Let's go! Pick up the pace! Circle around the pivot! Turn! I like this exercise. It's fun! Faster! Go, go! Go, go, go! Gérard? - Gérard! - Faster, faster! Don't flinch. Keep moving. Well… Oh, my… So? Happy? Satisfied with your first day at the Legion? Great! We'll do it again tomorrow at 5 a.m.! Good night, kids! The first time I saw you, I understood why I had come so far. Oh, words. Always words. I mean, do you think I'm happy here? You promised to take me away from this sad, austere life. I've packed and unpacked 100 times. You've canceled our departure every time. What are you waiting for to desert? A war? Katia, you're being hard on me. No one loves you like I do. Prove it then. Alfred, I won't wait forever. You promised me the moon. My love, don't ask me for the moon. We have the stars. Alfred… Heavens, my husband! Well, is this the time you're coming home? - And drunk! - Yes, I… Go to bed, you're embarrassing me. - But I… - Sure, Dear. Go to bed. I said go to bed. I'll stay awake all night to think about you. Goodbye, gorgeous. Goodbye, my friend. Are you waiting for desert people to turn your lights off? One day my prince charming will come One day my prince charming will come I come to get fiancé. Me in love. Him, soldier. Foreign Legion. Does this! Me from Paris! Paris, Eiffel tower! What is this in regards to? You speak French? Of course. I was there in May of 1968. Is that so? Well, I'm looking for… Oh, don't bother. I understood everything. I know what to do! You do? Come with me. This is a very old secret. Ask this mirror. Come! Beyond the seven mountains, beyond the seven valleys, mirror, my beautiful mirror, make the man of my life appear! Do you love me with a love as great as the desert? As pure as the sky? Enough of this talk. Go to the market, I'm hungry! But I'm broke! Grab the bucket. Go to the bank! And check the exchange rate! Don't let them trick you again! Get up! Bunch of slackers! Hi, guys. Oh! It's hot! Is that you, Gertrude? Sure it is! Here! So? Did you have a good night? I don't know, I slept the whole time. Get dressed. You. Follow me. I have something urgent for you. Shit, what's going to happen to us now? - Hello. - Hello. I love people who whistle while working. That's right. I'm kind of gay, as they say in the States. You didn't have a haircut? You don't like it? I do! It's just that legionnaires are usually more… manly. You do know men well. Is it that obvious? How did you end up here? Oh, you know, when you're 18… A look, a promise of happiness. The champagne that goes to your head. A place on a liner. The prestige of the uniform. Names that make you dream. Caracas, Marrakech… Tangier. Poitiers. And the Legion. The desert. Sadness and boredom. You mustn't let yourself go, girl. Your husband's charming. I like him. Do you have a thing for soldiers, too? Not really. What do you think of the Colonel? Ah, that's what I thought. I saw it right away with you two. I betrayed myself. Don't worry about it. My lips will be sealed. Women must be able to keep each others' secrets. Major, can I help my friend? Go ahead. Thank you. So? Hurry up! Faster! Is this going to take all day? It must be a local specialty. It must be. Your stew was good, Daniel. What was that after-taste? I always add a bit of cinnamon at the end to add flavor. Ah… You sure know how to cook. I know my way around the kitchen. You know all the tricks. Tricks to flirt with men, yes. I knit, too. - Really? - Yes. Oh, knitting, cooking, family life… I gave it all up a long time ago. Are you stressing out? Don't, ma'am! "Ma'am"? Are you serious? You're funny, Daniel. You're the only one who makes me laugh here. You're too good for the likes of me. You know what? You should change, it'd take your mind off things. Good idea! Come help me pick a dress. Great, I love that! I thought so. - What about this one? - It's pretty. - No, it's ugly. - It is pretty. I have a pink négligé, but it's too big for me. - It's beautiful! - It's your size! - It is? - Yes! Try it on. I shouldn't, ma'am. - You really want me to? - I do! By the way, how is your lover, the colonel girl? - Girl? - Yes, the colonel girl! But he's a man! Oh, you know, I do get genders confused sometimes. In any case, you don't seem to have very much fun with him. - Like Mrs. Bovary. - Who? Just a friend of mine. Put it on while I make some coffee. With all due respect, ma'am, that lover of yours is rather lousy! You think so? I do! He's classless, dry and all! You're right, in a way. And she doesn't stand up straight. What? She's leaning! - Like the tower of Pisa! - What? It's in Italy! No, he's not Italian! She doesn't understand! And he has a pouty mouth and drooping shoulders, he's ugly, very, very ugly. Heavens! The colonel! What's wrong? You didn't catch malaria, did you? Leave me alone! I'll slap you! Will you deal already? Oh… He's so cute! Is there a Swiss man in the room? - What a nice Bedouin. - Here. This is for you. Oh, it must be my suit! A little gift? Gladly! The stamps! For my collection. Give him the stamps, Eddy! - Thanks again. - Thank you very much. Goodbye, handsome Bedouin! - My suit! - You'll look so handsome in it! - Have you seen my husband? - He just left, ma'am. What's going on? It's for me! Excuse me, it's for me. Here I am. Good evening. Something to drink? Gérard. - Sir? - Champagne. Will a Perrier-Jouët do? - Very good. - OK, sir. - You're paying? - Don't worry about it. - My name's Jacques, you? - Katia. Do you come here often? I bet women like you, huh? Sometimes. Here. - Thanks. - To your loves. Not yet, Minister. It's tricky, the four of them are always together. What was that? All four? At the same time? During the mission? I see… That's pretty smart. I'll do it, sir. You can count on me. No, but within two days, I… My respects, Minister. That's no fun! I don't like walking! 20 miles in the desert is nothing, Swiss boy. You just have to pace yourself. I'll do it on one leg. Fast in your feet, slow in your head, right? Soldier, you're starting to annoy me. Stop fighting, girlfriends! You know it's one for all, all for one here! So? Attention! Soldiers. You're going to walk 20 miles in the desert without stopping. You're not here to jog or take leisurely walks. If one of your comrades falls, leave him be! Never forget the motto of our Legion, which is… "When you gotta go, you gotta go." No! Which is… "Enough is enough." No! Which is: "Walk or die." - He's crazy. - Be brave, man. They're all yours, Major. Soldiers! Forward march! One, two, one, two! - One, two, one, two, one, two! - Two! Two! Two! Two! Faster, come on! Faster! - Come on! - We're not waiting! Faster! Take my hand! Come on! Come on! Come on! Get back up! Get back up! Up! I'm done! Keep going! Hold on! Faster! Take my hand! Pull me! - Eddy! - Pull me, damn it! Go! I can't… - Gérard! - Don't stop! - Get up there! - I'm staying here! - I can't… - I lost my canteen… Get up here. Alright, guys. A half-hour nap. - Good night. - Good night. Water… Water… Gather up! Attention! Ouch! God damn it… I need four volunteers. Well, that was easy, gentlemen. Follow the sun to the oasis of Tozeur, as scouts. Then wait for everyone else. Do you understand? - But, huh… - No discussion! Colonel. Isn't the Tozeur oasis that way? You think so? Well, that's OK. They'll find another one. Let's go, guys. Be brave, guys. I'm thirsty. Hey! That's my foot! Oh, I can't go on. Water… Shit! It's empty, guys! Mine is too. What? Mine has a hole in it. Yours, too. - Look. - What the hell? I want to go back to Lausanne. - That's suspicious. - No, guys. Hang on, guys. Be brave! Hang on, OK? Hey! I can hear a dog. Where there's a dog… - The caravan will soon pass by. - Oh! And this! It's a mirage! Oh, guys! What did I tell you, guys? What did I tell you? Over here! Let's go! Who does she think she is? Eddy! She's even prettier than the other one! Listen, I'll hire you and fire all the others. You're pretty. Do we have a deal? We give you our rifles, and you get us a camel and a guide, OK? Shake on it. We made it, Eddy. No! No… - Gérard! - We made it. Kids! There you are! Oh, kiddos… What's with you? You're not being yourself. You don't understand the weight of my responsibilities. My mind is elsewhere right now. It must've been tough! Oh yes, Major! Especially for my pride! So you don't care about me anymore? Of course not, I think only of you, you know? Oaf. Typical soldier. How did they do it? Stop it, Eddy, you're bluffing! Hurry, times ten. I won, you lost. What's happening? It's raining inside, honey. What's this? There's not enough. Sure, sure! Yeah, he even stole your beer. Ouch! How dare you attack a woman? Ouch! Gladly! Have you heard the news? I was just appointed as the colonel's driver. So? I'm the Major's driver, I don't make a big deal about it. Brown-noser! One, two! One, two! One, two! So at the last time, bam! I escaped. Can you imagine me married, Major? What about you? You don't always do what you want in life. I met my wife through her brother. Him and I were very close. And I married his sister. That's life. Come on! Get back, I was here first. Sorry, but I was here first. Get back. I can't, I'm driving the major. What about this guy? - What? - Stop the car. Do you have change for 500 francs? The locals never do. I don't. It's for a gift. For a woman. You understand? The bank's right there. Wait for me. - I'll be right back. - Alright. …the bedside. - A big bedside. - On a white bed? - She was silly. - Wait here, Major. - Yes, sir? - Can you show me this necklace? Right away. - It's beautiful, how much? - It's a 100,000. 100,000. Here. - You don't want to haggle? - No, keep it all. I got it. What a good customer. Major, you shouldn't have. It will look great with my wife's dresses. Which you wear beautifully, by the way. Oh… You know… - You spy on me, little sneak. - Do you want me to? Colonel! Here's the change. Wait for me here. My money! - How much is this? - 100,000 dinars, sir. Are you kidding? Do you have anything else? - This. - That's 1,000 dinars. What about this? That 500 dinars. Yes. Five dinars? Five dinars. Alright. - This, but it's crap. - It's very nice. She'll love it, it's gorgeous. 500 dinars? Can you wrap it up? Right away. This is admirable. I'm sorry. I'm late. But here's to make up for it. You remembered my birthday. Oh, how thoughtful. Open it quickly, you'll like it. It's sumptuous. I would expect no less from you. Sumptuous indeed… I wouldn't dare give it to my cleaning lady. You don't like it? I've always been told that it's the thought that counts. Do you love me? Alfred. You're confusing. Excuse me. I'm glad I had an internship in the Swiss Navy. Attention! I'm giving you 30 seconds, 30, to be ready with your cross-country clothes with your pack. Now! Wait for me! Wait for me! Colonel… this is a mine field! No! Go! Go! Pull! Yeah! Pull! I need four volunteers to test the work of their peers. No, no. Not you. So? Losing your nerve? You're designated volunteers. - Not voluntarily. - What was that? Not voluntarily! We are! We were voluntarily assigned! Come on, buddy, you've seen worse. Guys! No hands! Well, almost. Your turn, Gérard! A small boat… Once… upon… a… time. There was… boat… It… it fell. It fell. It fell… Colonel. I don't want to go. Who do you think I am? Go! It's breaking… Good. That's good, Eddy. Keep going, Eddy. I wish I could trade places with that sheep. Caramba. Another miss. Guys… doesn't the colonel's relentlessness worry you? Jacques is right, it's suspicious. You're right, girlfriends, I'm all angsty. Is she at it again? Girls, discuss it amongst yourselves, I have some house cleaning to do. Bye. I'm glad you're here, Daniel. - Are you alone? - I'm expecting the colonel shortly. That's him. Go into the kitchen, I'll tell him I have a headache. No, I'm going to hide or he'll give me a hard time. Oh, dear friend. This is a bad time. I'm exhausted and I have a headache. Too bad, dear friend, I'll dive back into my studies of military tactics, I can't get enough of it. - May I use your phone? - Please do. I'll get you some Cognac. Is this the ministry? Yes, Minister. No, not yet, Minister… I'm like Napoleon after Waterloo. I'm very annoyed. These four boys are very lucky, but they'll be executed before the party. I guarantee that within 24 hours… My respects, Minister. You look preoccupied, my dear. Do I? No, no. Let's go for a walk, after all. I need it. What's wrong, kiddo? Are you cold? In this heat? He's not going to get me! This shark's not going to get me! I'm leaving! Back to Paris, anywhere but here. Let go of me! I'm leaving! Let go of me! - Sir! - Ah! - The news. - Let's see it. Shit, it's them! The killers I told you about. Are you sure? With the colonel? - Yes! - What does it say? I don't know. Hold on. Hey! Hold on! Translate this article for me. - That one? - Yes. The minister… The colonel. Last year… at the Legion party. Great friends, great friends. So he was trying to kill us? I don't believe this! - Hey, girlfriends! - Here comes Daniel. Girlfriends… It's terrible. I heard everything up there. - The colonel wants us dead! - See? We need to get out of here. This is weird. Give me some money. Hurry up! CAMEL SERVICE FUEL No, no! Jacques! Jacques, hurry! Put this on! Put it on, hurry! - That way. - Hurry, run, run! Stop! Stop messing around! It was just a joke, man. No, no! Quiet, guys. Beyond the gate, we're saved. It's the great escape. Hold your sheep back! It's not my fault. Attention! Bastards! Sergeant! Where's your sense of humor, Sergeant? They were just kidding. At ease! Come on! It was a good one, huh? - Let's go get a drink! - Yeah! You're silly! Come on guys, we got it this time! Stop! Stop! - Let's have a look. - What's wrong with the car? I think it's my fault. - I should've stuck to my diet. - Come on, help me! It's useless! Do you know what would happen to my nails? Oh, his nails! Guys, look! I have an idea. - Freedom! - Let's go! That way! - Eddy, it's the other way! - It's his camel calling him! Well, Jacques, that was a great idea. - I think we'll never escape. - Never. Fuck! So? So? We wanted to escape, jerks? And you stole a Jeep? You'll see what I'm made of! Dumbasses! I'm going to let you die of thirst. The sun will burn your skin. The crows will poke your eyes out. - Do you know the way to the Legion? - The Legion? Hop on, buddy! Good news at last. Fucking car! Shit! Faster! Faster! Oh boy… Guys! A naked girl! - Will you stop with your bullshit? - Just look! It was just a mirage. Girlfriends! Oh, my! Ah, mirages are nice. I see… I see a young girl. There's two of her. Yeah, I see them too! Yeah, must be a group mirage. Woohoo! My love! Look, do you think I'm pretty? That's great, we were just looking… For boys to take pictures. Are you a model now? Don't you think I'm beautiful enough? Dig me out, dummy! Only if you marry me. Never! Never, never, never! Ladies, we're leaving. - Hey, girls, come back! - Hey! Don't leave us in here to rot! Asshole! - Well… - Asshole. Fine, but I'm really just doing it for you, girls. Dummy, come back! - Come back! I agree. - My love. We're over here! Hurry up, dummy! My love! Yeah, right. We'll see about that. - Hurry up, dummy! - I'm doing my best! It's going in my face, dummy! Don't kiss me! One more! There's the timer and… I'm coming! You're so handsome. You smell like warm sand. My soldier. I've heard this once before… If you don't want to remain broke, invest in gold. That was our ad break. It's hot, I'm thirsty! I'd love to buy you a drink. Garçon. A cocktail, please. Thank you. - Here. - I'm not thirsty. But that's your cocktail. I never drink alcohol, fatty. Oh, my… How about my cocktail? Well… Oh, my… Who set them free? - Come. - Yes, let's go. Lift your leg. Lift it. The colonel will never find us here. There you are, finally. Is the matter settled? Soon. It's a matter of… - Is this a joke? - It's a matter of… The order came from the top. It's them or you, it has to end. Hide, guys! - Sweetheart! - Now's not the time! There they are! - Not now! - What's gotten into you? Well, here they are. Get out of the way, twins! Stop, soldiers! - Don't move. - I'm going to eat them up. No! Come on! Hands up! I'm drowning! Oh, soldiers! - Will you take me with you? - Move, Robinson Crusoe. Gentlemen. Since you deserted… You will be shot. To set an example. I told you he was a killer! He's a gangster! I should've killed you earlier! The sun's gone to your head, kid. Come on. You're a mean man! What did I just hear? You're going to shoot them? I'll call you back. - They tried to flee. - So? Don't get involved in this. Get out of here. - Is that your last word? - Yes. Alfred… You're a monster. We're through. - Évelyne! Sweetheart! - Jacques! Évelyne! What are you doing here? I came to be with you. Gérard, she came to be with me. Here we are. They're motivated. Don't worry, I'll take care of it. Well, that's all well and good, but we need to find a solution. I'll be right back. Édouard. Édouard, please, stop for a moment. Do you know terrible things are happening here? You can see that I'm very busy, leave me alone! LONG LIVE THE LEGION Are you deaf? We must act quickly! You're imagining things. Everything's fine. Get in line! Quickly! Dear friend, I came to ask you for the first dance. I'm not paralyzed, but it's so much more convenient… Thank you for being faithful to our parties, dear. Of course! Your husband the colonel is very nice. He's not my husband. He's a bandit. A friend? Even better! Courageous young men are about to be shot. My daughter is a good cook. I'll sell her to you cheap. - Our friends are in prison. - No! - Yes. - Buffalos? Here? How rare! They're usually up north. Don't listen to her, General, She's had too much whisky again. You ski? It's fun, but uncommon here! They're going to get shot. Someone embarrassed you? Well… You know what, General? Shit. Bless you. She's cute. Leave us. It's not a good time. I'll free them and they'll leave with the Jeep. Follow her, I'll take care of the Jeep. Katia! Katia's my friend! She's my friend! - Katia! - How did you do that? Don't ask. The colonel's Jeep is waiting for you out front! A Jeep! - Hurry! - Thank you! I've decided that I like women! - Hurry up, Jacques! - I'm coming! Come on! He's coming! Shoot! Positive and negative. This is going to be fun. Very nice. Don't! I swear that's the truth. The colonel is a felon? Why didn't Katia tell me? We were dancing together! You! Come with me. Everyone's acting so weird tonight. Évelyne! Sweetheart! Évelyne! I lost my sheep. This way, hurry! My God, what a party! Quick! Ah, what a show! - My love! - Not a good time! Finally, we're saved. Eddy, don't stay there! Stop! Stop! - I'll save her for you. First choice. - We'll write to you. Don't stay there! Out front! Go! Let go of me! But… Dumbass! It's the General. We're done for. Lets get out of here. - Which one is booby-trapped? - Huh… That one. Cheers! Oh, no! - They've escaped! - Let's go, guys! Wait for me! Wait for me! - Go! - Faster! Go, go! Go! HAIRDRESSER Over there. On the other side. Over there. - Over there… - Yeah, yeah. I'm sick of it, guys, I drove all night. - Gérard, take the wheel. - I don't have my license. I'm hungry. I haven't eaten since last night. Girls, we'll never find them in such a big place. Over there, look! We need to lose them. Let me drive, I know secret ways! - I'm sick of your secret ways! - Let me drive! - You want to drive? - What are you doing? - I'm sick of this car! You drive! - What are you doing? I'm sick of it! Why are you blowing up in anger? Thank you, General. Thank you, General. Thank you, General. They could've at least thanked me. There he is! What a nice little sheep! I used to know a sheep like you. Soldiers! From now on, you belong to the Legion! If any of you try to take it easy… The Legion will subdue them. If the Legion can't, the desert will! If the desert can't, the vultures will. And if the vultures can't… I will! I don't know what's worst for you! That guy again! Subtitle translation by: Michael Francart
