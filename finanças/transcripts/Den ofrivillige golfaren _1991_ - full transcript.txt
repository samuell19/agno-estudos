AND OTHER BRILLIANT ACTORS This story takes place during an economic boom in Sweden. PARVUS FINANCE Sorry to bother you. I see you have more important things to do. But what are we doing about this toaster factory? It's always pulling left. "Toastmaster." - Close it down. - Okay. - We're only after the land, right? - Yep. Sure. The meeting starts in two minutes, fellas. Okay. Parvus Finance regrets the closure and hopes you understand. My thanks for all these years. Ms. Wallin? Let's start here. - Thank you. - Thank you, Göte. Well, that's that. After twenty years, all you get is a couple vegetables and, "Goodbye!" Yeah. Parvus Finance... ...can kiss my ass! - Don't you want the stuff? - You take it, Stickan. That poor man. Give him some coins, Rutger. Here you go. Don't spend it all on pilsner. He looked nice and neat, after all. BRAMSERUD & PARTNERS Accumulate Create Perform Hey! Time for a round of golf? No, I have a lesson with Patric. I mean, my swing is perfect, but there are a few details left. Like hitting the ball and other little things. Are you here to play? No, we have a meeting about the new nine-hole course. We'll play a few holes after that, since we're already here. How's the building permit coming along? The County Custodian of Antiquities is making a fuss. He wants to classify the place as an archeological site. Archeologists are a strange bunch! Then again, he's not a golfer! They're at it again. Go inside, Olle. Grandma and Grandpa will be right in. - Ivar. Your helmet. - Yeah, yeah. How long are we going to live like this? We shouldn't have leased the land to them. That's just how it is, honey. It pays twice as much as grain. Pardon me. Guess I forgot to adjust my thumb. Oh! Sliced it again. Move your thumb over a bit more. You came into the swing from the outside. Now the tee is too high. - What's that? - A tee drill. - A "tee drill"? - Yeah. It really works. It's from the US. You should sell them in the pro shop. That's so unfair. Ask him to leave. Tell him his teddy bear kiddy show is on. Mikael is good. - Our juniors are really good. - Is he a member? Of course! There's a ten-year waiting list. And he's, what, seven? He must have applied when he was a sperm. His parents registered him when he was born. That's the only way to get in these days. Next, item four. Should we allow people to play shirtless? No. It's improper golf etiquette. No, men shouldn't play shirtless, unless we can, too. Sorry. Then there's today's most important item: The expansion of the golf course. To 27 holes. That is, an additional nine holes. The County Custodian of Antiquities said no. This has caused a bunch of problems. Everything's been delayed. We have to appeal. If we win, we won't get started until the winter, with all the problems that entails. Frozen ground and such. So, let's hear why the state wants to prevent people from having fun, from getting a little exercise. The area is most likely an old settlement from the Viking Age. A lot of ancient artifacts have been found here over the years. Oh, really? I've never heard anything about that. Have you, Torn? No. Olofsson, who leases the land to us, would have said something. He pointed out, actually, when we were turned down, that he's never seen any evidence of ancient artifacts. We have different information. The new course would be in an area with very sensitive plant and animal life. Personally, I don't think artificial lawns and sand traps have a place in our Swedish cultural landscape. Your personal opinion is totally irrelevant. Show us your ancient artifacts instead of spouting your theories. And as far as the sand traps... If you want to play in a sandbox, you can go to Birka. Well, I never...! - Well, there went the nine holes. - Nah. I think we need to try a more diplomatic approach. People like him need to be reined in. Who's that? It looks like the Antiquities Custodian. Quick! Get the tablecloth. I'll get the other stuff. Take off your helmet, Ivar. He'll think we're crazy. You're right in time for coffee. Would you like a cup? - Lovely weather. - Yes... I understand you're looking for your Viking village. Yeah... Time is running out. Have you really not found anything in all these years? Old coins, clay shards, or something similar? No, it's mostly been stone. Look, here's my ball! I thought it went onto the Olofssons' land. That's because you insist on playing without your glasses. It makes me look ten years younger. You don't want to play with an old bat, do you, darling? Of course not, dear. If you find anything, report it. According to the fifth paragraph of the Antiquities Act, you're committing a crime if you don't. I like the tension between the masculine and the feminine. They should probably be placed in a sort of diptych. What's that one called again? - That one? -"Vision of the Future Three." And that's "Vision of the Future Two"? No, it's "Night of the Lesbians." No... I don't know if the room can handle the intensity. - Hi, darling. - Hi. Nice! What the hell are you doing?! Sorry. - Can I talk to you? - Sure. I'm sorry, but we can't see each other tonight. I'm closing down a company. Well, a toaster factory... Skip the details. I know Parvus Finance is more important than me. We won't have time to play golf tomorrow, will we? Sure we will. I'll try to get away for a few hours. We have a 10:43 a.m. tee time with Tom and Pyttan. - We do, do we? - Yep. Isn't it a little strange that we only see each other on the golf course? - Now you're being unfair. - I'm being unfair? Oh, forgive me. I don't mind being your mistress, but I refuse to be your "golf buddy." Excuse me. I have to finish setting up the exhibition. Hey, listen... Will you be there tomorrow at 10:43 a.m.? I really did try to get out of tonight. Fine! I'll be there tomorrow at 10:43 a.m. - Hi. - Hi, Stig-Helmer! - Terrific you could come! - Yeah. - Nice to get some exercise. - It sure is. You can rent a racket. - I brought my own. - You did? Look. Oh, my! "Deluxe Badminton Set. Made in Taiwan." - Both ball and net! - Yep. - Where did you get it? - The gas station in Norrtull. It was really cheap. 39 kronor! But I guess the quality isn't that great. Stig-Helmer, sometimes I think you're screwing with me. Ten minutes. Only fifty minutes to go. Wearing yourself out like that can't be healthy. No. - Too bad about Toastmaster. - Yeah. It was a crap job, standing there checking toasters all day. Yeah, but I liked it there. My co-workers were nice. - But it didn't pay very well. - That's what I'm saying. It was a badly-paid, crap job. You should thank your lucky stars you escaped Toastmaster. Huh? Life is full of possibilities, Stig-Helmer. Yeah, maybe. - Have you ever pumped iron? - No, never. - It feels great. Try this one. - Me? Put this down. Grab it there and there. And lift! Go, Stig-Helmer! Come on! - Heavy. - Yeah. I'm going to an exhibition tonight. Want to come? - Sorry, I'm busy. - New girl? Not exactly. 'Hi! 'Hi! - Nice to see you. - Thanks. 'Hi! 'Hi! - Great turnout! - I know, right? - Congrats. - Thank you. - Where's the artist? - Over there. - The one with the beard? - No. Artists don't have beards these days. That's the art critic. The well-dressed man next to him is the artist. He doesn't look like he's starving. He was already famous at the academy. - Hi. - Hi! Welcome! Hello, there! An open structure. - You avoid complicated hierarchies. - Otherwise there's a gap. I want to transform utopia into pragmatism. Interesting. How much is that? It appears to transform utopia into pragmatism. Oh, that? - It's been a while. - Last time was at the golf club, I think. Yes. How's the golfing going? I switched to a Mazda. Seriously. I don't play as much as I used to. - It takes up so much time! - It really does. What's your handicap these days? Fat, nearsighted, Norwegian... I have a 30 handicap, but I never use it. I should only pay 50% of the annual fee. - Why's that? - I'm never on the fairway anyway. I heard you're dating some golf schmuck. Is it true? Well, it's a long story. We can talk about it some other time. Over dinner? - Sure. - I bought one of those noodle dishes. - Huh? - A wok! Oh! I'd love to. I need someone to socialize with. Green 61. Six, one. "Bingo" on 61. - Don't forget to give it to Karl Helmer. - I won't, Morn. You win 100 kronor. I can't believe they fired you. You've worked yourself to death for them since you left secondary school. - And you got nothing for it. - I got... At least your father got a gold watch. - It may have been gold plated, but still. - I got a toaster. - A toaster! - It was an F41. The deluxe model. Four slices. It was very expensive. You didn't get your engineering degree. What will become of you? Go Bajen! Fifty and unemployed. - We were promised other jobs. - Doing what? Something to do with the environment. You're squishing his paw! His paw is caught! Just get a regular car. It's so embarrassing getting into this mish-mash... - Messerschmitt, Mom. - That's what I said. I tried to stay calm and collected. But then that uppity chairman said I could go dig at Birka. I try not to have preconceived notions about golfers. Are you sure the settlement is in that area? Everything points to it. I'm worried they'll destroy the entire area. Golfers ruined the Viking port in Gotland. If we join the EEC, Sweden will be one big golf course. Poor baby. Huh? Were those bad old golfers mean to you? Lay down and dream that Sweden is one big excavation site. The helmet, darling. "Environmental care." What bullshit! Nope. Street sweepers, that's what we are. Although we're probably called "sidewalk therapists," or "trash cosmetologists" these days! At least we're out in the fresh air. That's nice. Don't be so damned positive, Stickan! Remember, you're Swedish! God, how people litter! Environmental Management Inc. Hey! I didn't recognize you without your golf clubs. Cute, darling. Cute. - Where are my golf clubs? - In the garage. Or you could do some gardening. Hit some dandelions with the sandwich, or whatever it's called. No time. I have a 10:43 tee time. When you're done with those 18 holes, maybe you could fix the ones in the fence and the roof. Then the fox said, "I'll eat you up!" How many times have I told you those aren't toys? You have your "Ninja Turtles" or whatever they're called. - Are you playing golf again? - No. - I'm going fishing. What did you think? - All you do is play golf. Welcome to Guldbrandsen Gallery's answering machine. I'm in meetings all day. Leave a message after the beep. Have a nice day. GULDBRANDSEN GALLERY COSMIC CADENCE 10,000 dollars? CLEAT CAFETERIA The delivery entrance is in the back. This entrance is for members only! Bruno, it's okay. He's here to see me. Who was that? I didn't think people like him existed anymore! He's the club's new chairman, Bruno Anderhage. Parvus Finance. - Hey, that's great! - Thanks. - I know exactly where to put them. Thanks! - Bye! 'Hi! 'Hi! - Hi! - Hello! We don't see each other for a year, now we see each other every day! - Are you going to play? - No... You can't waste such a beautiful day playing golf! Listen... What do you say to wok night tonight? - Tonight? - Yeah. What time did you have in mind? - Double bogey on nine? - Double bogey...? - Seven o'clock? - Yeah. That's fine. I have to go. We have a 10:43 tee time. - Okay - Bye! 'Hi! Hi! - Hi. - Hi. I'll show you a real whopper! What the hell is this? People will wear anything! Hi. I'm club chairman. Please dress appropriately in the future. This isn't a campground, it's a golf course. Asshole. Parvus Finance, Anderhage. Hello! Yes... Yes... Okay. Rune's Excavation is faxing over the estimate for the new holes. - One moment. I'll put my lawyer on. - Yes, hello. I don't know why they bother having an office. Where else would they put in the winter? Pyttan ! Oops. Tough luck, Bruno. It was a good shot. I thought I'd shoot 20 meters further with this. And you did. The ball went 20 meters further into the forest than usual. DO YOU OFTEN WIND UP HERE? THEN IT'S TIME FOR A LESSON! TALK TO PATRIK IN THE PRO SHOP. What kind of nonsense is this? Stickan! Don't dawdle. We have another district to do today. - Fore! - Watch out! "Watch out"? You've been playing golf for 50 years, and you yell "Watch out"? It's "fore"! Or are you so senile you've forgotten? What do those chickens look like? How much are you making on that Toastmaster deal? -20-25 million? - Something like that. So, he should be able to afford his own tees. But I guess they've gone up to 20 öre. 20 öre here, 20 öre there... Not a single goddamn tee. The people in front of us are a bunch of cheapskates. - Mette, do you have a tee? - Yes, of course. What color do you want? Something to match your pants? - Stop fooling around. - Catch. What do you say? 1,000 kronor closest to the hole? Deal. What the hell are they doing? You always have amateurs in front of you, and Ballesteros behind you. Damn! And he's supposed to be club chairman! What kind of club is that? It looks like a vacuum cleaner. Damn, what a strange game! Oops! Sorry. Too bad, Bruno. That damned bunker! It's hard to concentrate when people won't be quiet. - What are you doing? - I had a hundred kronor on the bunker. Pyttan had a hundred on the rough. Ta-da! A hundred kronor? Amateurs! Fucking clubs! You forfeit a stroke if you throw a club. I think you should shut your mouth, Mette. My ex-husband, Åke, was a golfer. Finally, I said to him, "You have to choose between me and golf!" He chose golf. This one's into gardening, so at least I see him. I wish Bruno would help out in the yard instead of playing stupid golf. He says he hates gardening. How many strokes so far, Bruno? None of your business. You count yours, I'll count mine. When we played last week... - Don't people have jobs? - No. They sold their house in Benidorm, and now they're moving to Florida. They're tired of Spain and the tourists. Shh, Alice. Rutger's putting for a birdie. Wait until I'm finished, darling. You know how annoyed you get when I talk while you're putting. And they bought a plot near Orlando, and they just love it there. I'm done talking, Rutger darling. I can't concentrate when she's quiet. Here, Stickan. Here. - Sink it. - What? Sink it. Okay... Shut your trap, Alice! Stig-Helmer is putting for a birdie! Yeah! What kind of nonsense is this? Good, Bruno! It's going in! No! That one's on me. Thanks. Hey! Where's the clubhouse? It's a five iron, then a dogleg right, and a nine iron. Maybe you don't play golf. It's behind the grove over there. Oh! Short hole is 3,000. Closest to the flag on the 16th is 6,000... Double or nothing on the 18th. That'll be 12,000, please. Didn't go too well, did it? No, it's these new clubs. I'm going to switch. I got 32 points, and you got 12. It's not hard to get 32 points when you play using ladies' rules. - I was just unlucky. - Then you must be very unlucky. You got 12 points on Tuesday. With your old clubs. It was all that goddamn cackling. I'm just a bit off kilter. It's hard to concentrate with all that cackling. Cackling? Now you listen to me, Bruno Anderhage! The little golf you've learned in 15 years is what a normal person learns in a week, so don't tell me you're "unlucky." Bullshit! So you think anyone could beat me at golf after one week? After one day, if you play like today. So you're saying, for example... ...that guy could kick my ass at golf after one week? That's what I'm saying. That's the dumbest thing I ever heard. How much do you want to bet? - Whatever you want. - A million? - Sure! - And where will you get the money? I can sell my large Picasso. There's no risk. You should consider it, Bruno. You two are my witnesses. One million. Deal! - Hey, you. You in the orange. - Huh? - No, the skinny one. Come here a sec. - Me? Do YOU play golf? - No. - Have you ever played golf? No, never. We have a little proposition. You get one week to learn golf, then you and I play a match. You get 100 if you do it. Here's my card. -100 kronor? That's not much. - No. 100,000. 100,000?! Is this "Candid Camera"? -"Anderhage." - Parvus Finance? Where did I hear that? - Do you think I should do it? - Yeah, why not? 100,000 kronor for a week's work. Not too shabby. I'd have said yes at once. Your Norwegian buddy plays golf. He can help you. Life is full of possibilities, Stig-Helmer... The match is on July 26th. That's in one week. We hope you'll do it. We need a knowledgeable judge. May I ask if there's money involved? As you know, club policy doesn't permit betting. - As chairman, you should know that. - No, this is a matter of honor. It's the Swedish Championships. Terribly exciting. Stig-Helmer Olsson leads Ove Sellberg by one stroke. Sellberg's put goes in! Do you want the lid on? No, you can take it off. Olsson has to sink his put for the victory. Olsson wins the Swedish Championship! - Hi, Mom, it's me. - Hi. Do you still have Uncle Julie's golf stuff? Yes. It's probably in the attic somewhere. What do you want it for? - Are you going to a costume party? - No! Poor Julius! Just because he moved up in society he thought he had to play golf and bridge... - But she was the one with the money. - I'm coming over to borrow the stuff. Must you really root around in the attic? I have a dentist appointment. - Not until next Thursday. - No, but still. Look! Here's something tartan. - That's my old Dixie vest. - Oh, right. Well... Stig-Helmer, look! Those are Uncle Julie's golf clothes. Here's his golf bag. Where are all the clubs? Oh, dear me! Oh, I know! Look! Morn! Oh! Yeah! They worked so well... I was mad, so I bet him anyone could beat him at golf after one week. - How much did you bet? - A million. Funny. How much did you really bet? It's true. A million kronor. That means nothing to Bruno. He's become reckless after all his business deals. He and Tom are always betting. Unfortunately for me, Bruno picked some random guy. Some scrawny sanitation worker. - Did you say Bruno? - Mm-hmm. Small, dark, new club chairman? Yeah. Do you know him? We met once, at the door to the club. Surely he's not your type. No. He's not my type, but I always fall for the wrong type. Do you think it's possible to learn to play golf in a week? I'm so childish! - What did the sanitation worker say? - He thought we were crazy. We said we'd pay him 100,000 kronor. - Bruno can pay. - And what if Bruno wins? Oh, my God! If Bruno wins... He'll be utterly unbearable. And I'll be utterly broke. I have to put a stop to it. Can I borrow your phone? Dad? It's for you. Thanks. - Anderhage. - Hi, it's Mette. It's inappropriate to call me at home. I know, but I need to talk to you. I'm sorry for my outburst. - Let's just forget it. - No,no. A deal's a deal, little lady. If you need something, we can meet at the driving range. I need to practice. Bye. Thanks for calling. Shit! - Playing golf again? - What? No. - That was my mistress. - Ha! You and your damn golf! Hi! Is this a bad time? Not at all. Come in, Stig-Helmer. - Thanks. - How's the new job? - Refreshing and good. - Great. I'm thinking of taking a leave of absence. - After only one day? - Yeah... This may sound a little strange, but I thought I'd learn to play golf. Golf? You're going to learn to play golf? - Is it hard? - No. It's super easy. Just hit far and straight and into a little hole. Great. Maybe you can teach me. I brought some stuff. Old clubs... Stig-Helmer, look at me. - Do you feel okay? - Sure. - You look weird. Are you drunk? - No. Breathe on me. I know you're down after this business with Toastmaster. Ole? Now it's war! I just don't get... - That's him! - But" Him? No, Stig-Helmer! I'll teach you how to eat Chinese. - Hold the chopsticks like this. - Okay. Bang them together, and then... Voilà! If wood is too hard, go with iron. - Well, like I said, Stig... Helmer? - Helmer. You'd be doing me a huge favor if you put Bruno Anderhage, formerly known as Andersson... If you put him in his place. - Maybe you've changed your mind. - No. Stig-Helmer hasn't changed his mind. Have you, Stig-Helmer? I'll coach you. That's very kind of you, Ole, but I think we need a pro. Fine. But first Stig-Helmer needs proper equipment. Who has the best selection? Swing-o-Tech. Scratch Company. - My clubs will be fine. - Clubs? Those aren't clubs. They're ancient artifacts! Okay. We'll meet outside Swing-o-Tech tomorrow. Noon okay? - Want me to pick you up? - No, I'll take the company car. ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT INC. PUSH FOR TICKET TICKET Swing-o-Tech We'll start with clubs... The beginner here wants a set of extremely easy-to-use clubs. He's going out as a scratch player next Thursday. Oh! Then I suggest a cavity back, with a fairly low center of gravity. Great. Of course. My thoughts exactly. Go for it! Whoops! - Great, Stig-Helmer! - This is fun! Si? That was Jack Nicklaus. Final nail in the coffin. I'll take Stig-Helmer to hit a couple of buckets at "Bramserud's golf school." Do so. God, I hate Bruno Anderhage! He brings out the worst in me. Hit a couple of "buckets"? Yeah. Hit a couple of buckets. Buckets...? Hop in. Sit down. I'm in a fucking hurry. Hi, it's Anderhage. Tell Patric I'll be a little late for my lesson. Damn it! He's one to talk about proper attire! You came into the swing from the outside again. That slice could cost me a million. It won't take that many lessons. What? Oh, right. Quiet, Fifi! Carina thinks I'm out with the dog. The hardest part of this sport is getting past the wife! When I play bandy, I play from this direction. You brought Uncle Julie's clubs. - Yeah, as a sort of mascot. - Okay. Squeeze there with your hand, and put your thumb there... There. Now try and hit it! - Well, now... - I guess my hands are too sweaty. Parvus Finance - I hit a bucket at lunch. Know who I saw? - No. - Your opponent. - The street sweeper? - How is he? - He has a natural, powerful swing. - He does? - But he didn't hit the ball. But he managed to throw the club 5 meters. And, I must say, it flew straight. Yeah... It'll be like taking candy from a baby. Damn it! It pulls to the left. "Hands at the top of the back swing." - Good morning, Helmer! - Hi! Come in! Snazzy look, Stig-Helmer! Are those the one-and-only Uncle Julie's clothes? Yeah. The socks are a little short... - Was he any good at golf? - No. He had a two... - Handicap? A two? - Yep... - We brought some golf books. - Thanks. Yes! Golf Without Tears! Roderic McDougall. - Where did you get this? - It was in Uncle Julie's bag. It was the number-one golf bible in the '60s. Roderic "Dogleg" McDougall. I wonder what he's up to these days? Stig-Helmer? This is our stop. His father drove the Flying Scotsman. - What? - The Flying Scotsman. - I see. - It's a famous locomotive. I'm going to buy a model of it when I have the money. Great! How strange! - We were supposed to be picked up. - Okay... Maybe they didn't get our message. - I'll go call. - Okay. Fourteen McDougalls in the phone book, and you're picking up chicks. This is... - Nice little village. - Yeah. - And nice little lady, too. Fiona. - Yeah... The father seems a bit strange. I wonder what he's up to. I wouldn't worry. People are slightly eccentric here. If you're eccentric here, you're original. It's not like it is in Sweden, where you're just an idiot. You'd fit in well here, Stig-Helmer. - I'm not all that original. - No, you're completely average. Everyone plays with trains and drives a Messerschmitt while wearing their uncle's golf pants. - What do you want? - A glass of milk, I think. Milk? Stig-Helmer! This is a pub! They don't have milk here. Slainte. - Stig-Helmer Olsson. - Ole Bramserud. Hi there. - Did you see that? - Yep. Where the hell did it go? Here. What the hell are you doing? Picking up my ball? You're dangerous. You almost hit a deer. I don't give a shit about your deer! This is a golf course. Don't pick up the balls! This is a forest. The Right of Public Access applies here. The golf course is that way, and it's covered with grass. That's none of your fucking concern. Stick to your Viking graves. Give me my ball before something happens. Sure... Bovista.Puffball. Good edible mushroom. Your ball is in the bushes over there. Happy hunting! Ole? Ole? - Hi. - Hi. Do you hear that? Yeah. Sounds like an iron pipe or something. You're too old to believe in the plumber, Stig-Helmer. - Yeah... - Go back to bed. Nighty-night. Good night. Fiona... - Nice to get some exercise, isn't it? - Yeah. - Tired? - A little. Now we just have to go back! Jesus! Think I'll make it with a three? - I would play it safe. -"Safe"? - Can I give you a tip? - What? - Hit farther and straighter? - Play by ladies' rules. - Ladies' rules? - Don't be so macho. Use the clubs you can handle. Skip the woods. Oh, no. There will be no ladies' rules here. It was just a suggestion. It's your money. What the hell was that? Here it is. What the hell...? I hit a rabbit. Black grouse. A rock ptarmigan down here? Someone's screwing with us. I've had it with that Viking idiot. I'm giving the go-ahead for the new holes today. - And who pays if we're turned down? - I do. Amazing! Where did you learn to do that? I kicked the ball around as a kid. All the little boys did. Golf seems trickier. WE'RE BUILDING VITTRINGE'S NEW 9-HOLE GOLF COURSE Line it up properly and caress the ball away. Okay. Yes! Not bad. One more. Can you help me get loose? - His breath isn't to be trifled with. - No... Talk about 70-year-old pure malt. The smell isn't so bad, but it stings my eyes a little. Twenty-nine? Now we're getting somewhere. - What are you having? - A draft beer, please. A draft beer and a mineral water, please. Mineral water? Are you sick? No, but I'm going to win this game. No booze, eight hours of sleep, and the rest is golf. - What does Carina think about that? - She's going to Florida with the kids. I'm nervous. Calm. Stig! Is he a good teacher? He mostly goes fishing. Stig-Helmer is practicing with the Vardon. He made par today. Well, that's encouraging, but who's Vardon? It's a kind of robot. - Row boat? - No, not a row boat. - Robot! - I can't hear you. Where are you? I'm at the Laughing Duck. He's really good. It's going really well. Relax! Bye! Bye. A robot and a laughing duck. I see! Well, Pablo, it's been nice. I can't sing and don't know any lyrics. - We can hum... - What? "Anslagstavlan." - No. - Yes! Come on! Stig-Helmer! It's like I said. Life is full of possibilities, Stig-Helmer. You could have checked toasters until your dying day. Now, you're practicing golf in Scotland with a British Open champion. And you met Fiona. Here they come. - Hi. - Hi. This is Fiona McDougall. This is Roderic McDougall. He's been coaching Stig-Helmer. McDougall's been coaching Olsson? Yep. Ballesteros wasn't available. Neither was Jack Nicklaus. - I think this has gotten out of hand. - So do I. I think we should stop this childishness. So do I, honestly speaking. - But unfortunately, it's too late. - How do you mean? Well, we sold the broadcasting rights for the competition to Scottish TV. Too bad. You should have given the Board a few days' notice before bringing in a TV crew and a winner of the British Open. I swear I had no idea. Sure. We'll discuss it at the next Board meeting. Hey. - Keep your head down. - Focus on the ball and swing gently. - And win. - I'll do my best. - I hope we have a good game. - Thanks. I must congratulate you on your hat. - I see you're only using irons. - Yeah. I have the lowest handicap, so I guess I start. We'll find it. A golf robot, was it? YES! - Tom! - Yeah? - Am I allowed to move loose objects? - I think so. Bastard! HARD TO HIT? TAKE A LESSON WITH PATRIC! Sorry, Bruno. Take it easy, Bruno. Damn it! Goddammit! Wait, Bruno! There's a kid in the bunker. Hey, kid! This isn't a fucking playground! - What the hell is this? - How cute! Fucking kid! Unbelievable! - Oh, God! - What do I do now? You'll have to wait until the ball comes out... Too bad, Bruno. Straight to the hole, Stig-Helmer! The kid says you ruined his farm. He should stay off the golf course. This isn't a playground. Keep an eye on him. Will you please move? Go! Do you see the flag? Yeah. - Aim for the flag and keep your head down. - Okay. It landed in the truck! Congrats! Thanks! Stig-Helmer... YES! Nice, Bruno. Well, little lady, that's that. You know where to send the check. Gentlemen! The match isn't over yet. According to rule 19.1, Olsson has the right to play the ball where it lies. Rune's Excavation. What? No, I don't have time. I'm getting paid by the job. Oh? 1,000 kronor? I'm on my way. If he makes it in two, you tie. But he won't. Let's hope not. What the hell is he doing here? Finally! How the hell did he do that? One million kronor to Mette Guldbrandsen Here. Congrats. Use the money to buy yourself some tees. What the hell are you doing? Are you out of your mind? - I'm plowing my land. - What? - I'm turning it into an energy forest. - An energy forest?! Like you said, this isn't a playground! Subtitles: Sofia Anulf
