Wonderful! Wonderful! He'll take a salary but won't do any work. He's scared of girls. Coward! Hey, open! Open the door! Open the door. Open the door! Watchman, open the door! Where are you going in such a hurry? Sir! Sir! Sir! You'll keep saying 'sir, sir'? Will you say something? Where are you going? Sir, I went to give food to madam. Sir, I survived the German war... but I had to run from here. Why are you tarnishing the name of brave people? Go! Get more food. As you say, sir. Oh dad, you! Okay, so you're still on a hunger strike? What happened to this room? Did an earthquake strike? Not yet, but it will. Oh, what am I going to lose from it? Instead of locking me up here... why not just tie me up in chains? I'll do it if necessary. With pleasure! You can tie me up in chains. You can do whatever you like. But as long as you imprison me on this boat... I will not eat food. Baby, stop acting like a child. You've grown up now. And you also know very well... that what I want to happen, will happen. Dad! Why don't you try to understand? It's a question of my life. Why are you against my marriage? I am not against marriage, I am against the one... whom you want to marry. I won't ever get married... if I can't marry Sumanth. How won't you marry? Come in, Khan. So, you have come again, Khan? Wait! Put the food over there. - I won't eat the food. - Who told you to? It's for me. Khan, serve the food. Oh! I am very hungry. I feel as though... I haven't eaten food for the last two days. Yes Khan, you can go now. What? Parathal Rana Pratap used to eat it. Oh, roast mutton! His highness Akbar... liked it a lot. You're using brave people's names... while playing with knife and fork. I won't eat the food. I'm not hungry. Who's telling you to? It's your loss. Why not! You have to live with... We used to take poison. Dad! You feel like joking and it's hurting me. Why don't you try to understand, dad? I, I love Sumanth. Why do you love him? What's the reason? Because I like him. And he's the best pilot in this world. And he'll take you to the moon, right? But remember one thing. He doesn't love you. He loves my seven hundred million rupees. Yes, every time you say the same thing... about the person who loves me. Not only me, the whole world is... saying the same thing about that scoundrel. I'm telling the truth. This is his third love affair. Whenever he falls in love... it's with a millionaire's daughter. He never loved any of them. And he doesn't now, either. You know nothing. It's all lies! You've begun misbehaving with me! Get out of my sight! Sir is calling. Yes, madam. Watchman! What are you doing there? - Where's Baby? - Sir. Why are you running like wild animals here and there? Quickly, lower the boat. Captain! Captain! Captain! Captain! Open the door. Hey, open the door of sir's cabin. Why are you surprised? My beloved is on the other side. The river flows between us. Oarsmen, take me to the other side. My beloved is on the other side. The river flows between us. Oarsmen, take me to the other side. My beloved's village is far from here. No one knows what I am going through. The ocean is deep and I am alone. There is no one to help me. Oarsmen, take me to the other side. My heart swings looking at the waves. My beloved smiles at me as I see... his image in the water. We longed to see each other... and they gesture to each other all the time. Oarsmen, take me to the other side. My beloved is on the other side. The river flows between us. Oarsmen, take me to the other side. Why are you surprised? The boat is returning empty. I don't think they found Baby. I say, that even an airplane... cannot catch my Baby. - After all, she's my daughter. - Have you ever thought about it? Yes, girls are very smart these days. Not all! Say only Sir Girdharilal's daughter. But, for how long will she show her intelligence? She doesn't have even a single penny with her. Ultimately she'll return to me. But sir, you're forgetting the diamond ring on her finger. What's that, a diamond ring? I'm ruined! Captain... inform my friends... publish it in the newspapers... announce it on the radio. Keep an eye on Sumanth's every move. Understand? Yes, sir. Do you want toast. Madam? - Toast? - Toast. - Toast is over. - Over? - Get anything. - Anything? Anything? Chilli! Chilli! Waiter! Waiter! Water! - What do you want, madam? - Water! Water! Water! Water! Excuse me. We have an important announcement. It is announced to the public that... Sir Girdharilal's daughter, Kammo... has jumped from the ship and escaped from there. Anybody finding her will receive... a reward of one hundred twenty five thousand rupees. This is radio Ceylon. And now our film program begins. Waiter! Waiter! Madam. Telephone. Over there. - Post office. - Post Office? Yes, yes, I am Sagar. I'm the writer for your newspaper 'New World'. Hang up. You've driven me crazy. You have sent so many stories... all ordinary and nonsense. I've become sick after reading your stories. I've come to Bangalore to get away and I find no peace here, either. The story I'm going to narrate now is quite interesting. - You'll feel very nice after hearing it. - Send it in if you like. I'll throw it in the trash without reading it. Yes. Okay, so want to come and meet me personally? - Most welcome. - Yes, I'll be right there, sir. Don't you dare come here or I'll bang your head. Listen. How do I make you believe... this is a true story? Why won't you believe me? Very well, I'll come and narrate over there. Satisfaction guaranteed! Remember, you'll make a profit of at least one lakh rupees. And I want only a thousand rupees. Okay. Only a thousand rupees? Look, one astrologer saw my palm yesterday... and told me he predicted that... I'm going to kill a lousy writer. You're welcome. Yes, yes, yes, why are you angry? I'll hang up the phone. Now what's the use of calling? I'm going to meet you. What did you say? In hell! No, not in hell. We'll meet in Bangalore. Hurry up, mister! Shut up! I'm sorry, I didn't mean you. I was telling the lady outside. These people are very rude. Not you, I'm sorry. I was saying... there's a bus to Bangalore right outside. I'll come immediately. Hello! Who's speaking? Mr. Sumanth is there? Not there! What did you say? Races? He's gone to Bangalore? Bangalore. Madam, what's the matter, madam? I want to go to Bangalore. Look, you do one thing. You can fly and get there sooner. By airplane? Understood! Understood! Your heart is very weak. Don't worry, doesn't matter! There is one beautiful idea, madam. You go by bus. The fare is very low. That's right! Where's the bus stand? Come, I'll show you. No, madam, no. Wait. Wait. If I go with you I'll lose my job. I'll tell you. Turn right from here. From the right hand you go to the left hand. There's post board over there. From there you turn left. And from left you take a right. There's a movie theater. The Roxy Cinema. From there you take a turn and madam! Madam! Madam! Ticket please. Sir, you can sit over there. - How do I get there? - By walking, sir. But you're blocking the way. A bird can't even pass... and you expect a human being like me to get through? Be careful. I hope he doesn't suffacate. Mind your own business. Oh, so you can speak in English also? Ticket please! Ticket please! So you don't have a ticket? Go. Excuse me! What nonsense is this? This is my seat. - Is this your seat? - Yes. Conductor? Are the passengers' names written on the seats? No. Conductor, are the seats measured so only half a person can sit? - Yes. - No. What nonsense is this? In the future, if you go on a journey then please... take a healthy person along with you. Or else this beautiful nose might get injured. - Sir. - What is it? Mr. Sumanth's letter. You've taken such an unlucky person's name so early in the morning. Any information about Baby? No, we've published her photograph... in all the newspapers. We've sent telegrams to all her friends and loved ones. Now everything is in God's hands. Remember, if Baby isn't found soon... then your salary is also in God's hands. Oh lord, help this God... and immediately send the prize of 125,000 lakhs over here. Oh lord, you don't know I'm experiencing a money crunch. Now tell me, how can I carry around this punishment? Oh lord, if you bless me, I'll get rid of all my worries. - Hey, not like this! - Then how? Like this! You can perform miracles, oh lord Ram. Send a lottery of 125,000 rupees, on my name. I am greedy for money. I wake up in in my bed thinking... 'When will poverty vanish from my house?' You can perform miracles, oh lord Ram. Send a lottery of 125,000 rupees, on my name. The news is so nice in the newspaper. Goddess Laxmi will obey us. We'll have a bungalow in the stars. You can perform miracles, oh lord Ram. Send a lottery of 125,000 rupees, on my name. In this money crunch I have to bear... the expenses for two persons. We shared what little we had. The day we dreamed of never came. You can perform miracles, oh lord Ram. Send a lottery of 125,000 rupees, on my name. She's sleeping peacefully... and has awakened the other person. Come on! Come on, get down! Where are we? - What? - Where are we? You're in heaven and I'm in hell. - What do you mean? - You slept well using me as your pillow. I didn't sleep a wink. Oh, I am sorry. Okay, you're forgiven. I've wasted many nights like this, and now one more. - The bus will stop for half an hour. - Conductor? - Yes? - Only half an hour? - Yes. Any objections? You don't interfere. Who is asking you? - If I knew you were so shrewd... - Then? I'd have moved my shoulder while you were sleeping. Your beautiful nose would have broken into pieces. She wants to talk to me. - Conductor! - Yes? Look, I'm going out. Wait for me if I'm late. Yes. Yes, she's travelling by bus... and is dreaming of an airplane. - "Wait for me if I'm late!" - Conductor! - Yes? - Wait for me, too. - Wait for you, too. As though I'm their servant. I'm a conductor! A conductor! Not a useless person. Driver, have you seen how they behave towards me? Dumbri, if God shows his miracle... and we find this lady... We'll get a reward of 125,000 rupees. - Understand? - From the day I married you... you've so many dreams of this type. But when you woke up you were still a poor man. Oh, your parents gave you something that you talk to me this way? Don't you feel ashamed for telling lies? You've named yourself as God. You bought this auto with my wedding dowry. And you're feeding yourself from it. Or else you would have starved. Right now I'm happy looking at this photograph. Where shall I look for you? Where shall I find you? Hey! I've found that girl! Hey wait! Wow! Come with me. Shut up! Shameless person! Good! Today's work was done by her. My hand was in pain. I let her go because she was a woman. Otherwise, I'd have smashed her like a mosquito. Come on! I'm saying, breakfast is ready. Would you like some? - What's this? - Maize. You don't recognize maize? - Where are you from? - Please keep quiet. Who asked you? - What do you mean? - You put the evil eye on it. My stomach would have ached had I eaten it. One maize. "Ghandhi-ji will repent." "Only he can save us." - Keep quiet! - Who's talking to you? "Ghandhi-ji will repent." "Only he can save us." Oh! This is maize! It's called corn! You make corn soup, biscuits, pudding... and cake, too. You make maize bread also from it. Maybe you don't know that? The conductor was right. Traveling on a bus while dreaming of an airplane. Eating corn and talking about cakes and puddings. "Ghandhi-ji will repent." "Only he can save us." "Ghandhi-ji will repent." They are so pretty. Why are these poor birds caged? Madam, it's my business. How else will we eat? - How much to buy them all? - Ten rupees. Ten rupees! Take this. Twenty rupees. May God bless you. I fly like a bird in the sky. Today I feel like... a free bird in this world. Free bird. My life is full of happiness today. All my sorrows are finished today. Someone sings songs in the green fields. Today I am free willed. My life is filled with the colors of joy. I feel like a free bird in this world today. I fly like a bird in the sky. Today I feel like... a free bird in this world. I feel like playing with nature. I feel like playing with the waves in the river. I feel like playing with the moon, sun and stars. I feel like embracing the sky in my arms. I keep on moving and singing... lost in my own world. Today I am free willed I fly like a bird in the sky. Today I feel like... a free bird in this world. Free bird I'll have clouds surrounding me. I'll adorn anklets shining like thunder bolts. I'll steal the kohl from the black clouds. My life is like a flowing river. My heart beats like waves from the cool breeze. Today I am free willed. I fly like a bird in the sky. Today I feel like... a free bird in this world. Look, please give that blue bag to me. Listen, you must be having a black briefcase. Please give it to me. Thank you. The bus left? Yes. They couldn't wait. - The driver eloped with it. - The driver was very bad. I told him not to leave until I returned. You're right, your highness! You're right! How dare that slave not obey your order? He must not have understood. - He mistook you for the queen of cards. - Thank you! But, how did you miss the bus? - I thought I could help you. - I'm not a child. Yet you're behaving like a new born baby. I don't like any misbehavior. After all, what do you think I am? I've imagined nice things about you. I wish even you could understand yourself. I think this is a picture of me. No, it's a picture of me. My father's name is Sir Girdharilal. I've run away from home to marry Sumanth... and the one who finds me will get... a reward of 125,000 rupees. Oh! So you're waiting to collect... those 125,000 rupees? Don't worry, keep your mouth shut. After reaching Bangalore I'll give you the address where you can collect the money. Maybe you've not come across words like 'sympathy and 'humanity'? You know only how to use money to buy what you want. Yes, even human beings! They aren't human beings. They're animals imprisoned in the cage of life. Animals! And you can only watch the animals! Hey Mr. Humanity. Now what happens? Hey, I'll write a reference that you're an honest and loyal person. Now say something? This human being is strange. He doesn't even answer the questions. If you don't want to speak, then go do as you please. This kid has more humanity in him than the human beings. At least it answered me. Human beings follow the language of humans and... and animals follow their own languages. Oh my dear kid! Can you tell me... when the next bus arrives? It's saying it'll come soon. Oh my dear kid, teach this lady some manners. Tell her to listen to her elders. Her father is right that... Sumanth is not a nice person. - He's marrying her for her money. - Shut up! I know much better than you. I don't need your opinion. This girl is strange. She's polite when you're angry and angry when you make her understand. Nothing can beat a good dance. He gets mesmerized. Mr.Sumanth, you're a very passionate person. Sir Girdharilal's daughter... ran away because of her love for you. And you're having a good time over here. This isn't anything new. She's the third girl to fall into my love trap. But Girdharilal is a very stubborn man. This time you're playing with fire. Do you think I have to play with water to earn... those 700 million rupees? Once I get it, then you'll see... all the pleasures of the world at our feet. All the lines of Air India lnternational... will be waiting to take us all around the world. All countries will call out to me... 'Sumanth, where are you?' 'Come once, at least.' if your dreams don't come true... imagine what you'll face? Nothing untoward will happen. I'll find a new house. As long as I'm alive, if one girl doesn't agree... the next one will, or the next. This is also fine. This is also done. This, too. Wow! I've written such a nice couplet. 'I am desperate to meet you.' 'Come, come don't be so stubborn.' 'Please listen to me once for God's sake.' 'You are leaving? Wait, listen to me once.' 'I used to say that, let it be I never said anything.' 'Go.' Wow! It's a very nice couplet! Both the... That's why I was wondering... how I'm able to write the couplets so quickly? I wasn't aware that Kalidas's poetry... had been placed next to me. Madam, I'm known as a bard in Urdu... as lyricist in Hindi and a poet in English. What's your good name? Wow! You've answered it so nicely... with your silence that you don't need... give your introduction. I've written a couplet. Please listen to it. 'After you changed your view of me... you don't even recognize my face.' 'And... And you stare in such a way as though... - you don't even know me.' - Shut up! Greetings. I don't think you liked the couplet. I swear on you I'm an all-rounder! Listen to another couplet. 'Though I am in pain, then too I smile.' 'Though my eyes are full of tears, then too I don't cry.' 'And I don't sleep the whole night so that... I don't have any dreams.' How did you like my couplets? You're yawning? A new way of praising someone? Wow! 'He sighed and became crazy for her.' 'Think about the one who went through all this.' I know this couplet has set your heart on fire. I hope the bus doesn't catch fire. If there's a fire, I'll put it out. My name is Sagar. Come on now, get up from here! - Why? - If you ask 'why' again... I'll read you such a couplet you'll be in real trouble! Do you follow? You're flirting with my wife! - Come on get up from here! - Your wife? - Yes! I've wasted my couplets. Get up from here or else I will humiliate you. I'll get up, I have been humiliated very badly... and am leaving your place. He seems to be a poet from some theatrical company. If you stop talking, I'll be able to thank you. I felt sorry for the guy and came over here. So a very good poet doesn't go insane sitting next to you. Nav Bharat Times! Today's special news! Today's special news! Nav Bharat Times! 1.25 lakhs rupees reward! Indian Express! Nav Bharat Times! Indian Express! Nav Bharat Times! Today's special news! 1.25 lakhs rupees reward! Today's special news! Millionaire's daughter runs away. 1.25 lakhs reward! Today's special news! A millionaire's daughter runs away! Hey, boy. Driver, the news is the bridge... has broken. It's being repaired. - Then? - Then what? Until it's repaired... you can't change buses. Listen. Constable. Listen. How much time will it take? Maybe one night, maybe ten. - Ten nights? - Yes. Listen, are there any guest houses here? There are none here, but there's one there. Mr. Banwarilal is its owner. But it's only for married couples. - Not for bachelors. - But who's a bachelor here? You wait. I'll return soon. Why are you sitting alone? Where's your husband gone? You've returned to harrass me? Shall I call him? Why not! You call him and I'll call the police. - Police? - Yes, look at this, look here. The couplet is, 'You gain nothing... when you tell the truth in love.' 'But now the time has come... when you'll be rewarded.' Look at this, 1.25 lakhs! How was my couplet? What? Oh! Here he comes. He's come. Oh! I've banged my head. Hey, beautiful damsel. The bus won't go any further. We'll have to stay tonight at the guest house nearby. Get down. Driver... please have our luggage brought. Come on, come. Do you know that poet has come to know everything? He was just showing me the newspaper. Really? You seem to be a very good poet. By your blessings! I've been a poet for the last twenty years. I have written a new couplet. Please listen to it. 'You gain nothing in love when you tell the truth.' But why are you looking at your palm like that? Tell me. This hand? Not my palm. I'm reading the lines on my palm. - Really? - I'm reading the number of poets... I'm going to kill. I have killed three poets before now. You say that as if it's something great. What's your profession? - Dacoit. - What? What did you say? Dacoit, you said? - I'm finished! - How may kids do you have? I'll tell you. A poet always has many children. - Eleven. - Shut up! I'll be quiet. But why are you asking? I will kill your entire family. - What? - Yes? Now, pay attention to the name. Dacoit Sultana. - Understand? I understood everything. The same dacoit Sultana, who has... created fear in the whole area? Oh! I had heard the name. And today I've met you. - Get up. - Yes. Be a man and look me in the eye. But I have totally gone blind. Don't worry, I squeeze the trigger and... you'll see the sun from its light. Oh! But why are you bothering yourself? I'll leave here. Please forgive me. You'll apologize for your whole family. Why not! Not only once but many times. But let me go and get my family. - The newspaper? - The newspaper! This is a death letter for me. I'll tear it right now. Like this, okay? - If you mention this to anybody, then? - Mention? Am I a donkey? I love my life. I love my wife and kids. And I love this girl! I'm eloping with her. Understand? You can elope with her, sure! Elope with her, if you want. If you allow me, may I write poetry in your honor? 'Don't cry, don't complain, try to... soon escape from here.' 'Try to soon...' Great! He's been irritating me for a long time. How did you get rid of him? With my intelligent brain, which you don't have! I made a mistake in praising you. You've started acting too arrogant. - What? - Yes! Where's that guest house? Can't you see? It's over there. Follow me. Understood! Understood! - I have a question. - If you're husband and wife... why do you want two separate rooms? Why? Well, separate! We had a fight in the bus. Very bad. You're talking like a child. If you stay in separate rooms... your fight will go on forever. Go and select your room. We'll stay separately. Then stay elsewhere! - What other place? - Stop bothering me. I have to work. - Please listen. - You'll take the room? - Yes. - Pay me five rupees. - Five rupees? - Yes, five rupees. Which are our rooms, Mr. Humanity? What 'rooms'? We've got one room. I won't stay with you in one room. - Then you can sleep in the jungle. - Don't you feel ashamed? We'll stay in one room. I'm more shy than you. But I'm helpless. He only hands out rooms to married couples. And if you're married, he gives only one room. So you told them here, too, that we're married? I had no choice! I don't want you for a wife. Understand? I won't stay in this room! Who wants you to? Who! Who is it? Hey, you? What are you doing over here in the dark, dear? Well, no reason. Oh God! It's a bad thing. There are fights between a husband and wife. So what? Go, go back to your room. What? No. It's late at night. It's going to rain. And yes, sometimes snakes... come out over here, dear. Let them come. Decent girls don't stay alone... in the dark this way, dear. What might someone say? Look, I'm a very strict person. Return to your room. What! Return immediately, or I'll take you there, okay? Come on. Bad, very bad! The ignorant husbands of of today are henpecked... and spoil their wives by giving in to their demands. - What! - Go, go. Go on ahead. Who is it? Open the door. Who is it? You're a rude husband! You left your wife alone and it's going to rain. What to do? She won't listen to reason. If she doesn't listen, then beat her to make her understand. Yes, from now on... Come on, now go inside! Come on. It seems her parents have spoiled this girl a lot. You're right. What are you still doing here? Come on. Shut the door. - Well, actually the door... - Shut the door! Don't get scared, beautiful damsel. Look at this. This is your room. And this is mine. I won't stay here! After all, what do you think of yourself? I'm trying to make you believe I'm not.. Interested in your beauty or your money. My only interest in you... is to write a beautiful story of this journey. That story gets published and I become famous worldwide. Understand? So, you're a newspaper editor? No, I'm a writer. That's the reason for your greed? Then I'll never stay here! I'll jump over that wall. Be my guest. You'll break your leg and I'll bring you back here. The only difference will be the title, "Limping Damsel", and not "Beautiful Damsel". Have mercy on your family. - You look so scared. - What? - I feel sorry for you. - Thanks for your concern. Listen to me. Return home. - This person doesn't deserve you. - How can you say that? I'm a reporter. Nothing stays hidden from a reporter. I know very well what kind of person Sumanth is. Before you, he was with Sir Mohanlal's daughter. After that, Raibahdur's niece, and now you. Don't you feel ashamed, blaming someone like this? It's my life. I'll do what I want. Who are you to judge me? Everything looks yellow to a jaundiced eye. Don't believe me. The day that person betrays you, you'll remember someone tried to warn you. I am going to think about the story. Do whatever you like. This romantic night and the beautiful atmosphere. Oh lovely moon, mesmerize us... with your charm. The moonlight is silent after evoking my desires. This atmosphere is not allowing me to sleep. The swaying breeze and the blue sky. Why is my heart so restless? What do I lack in my life? The moonlight is silent after evoking my desires. This atmosphere is not allowing me to sleep. This romantic night and the beautiful atmosphere. Oh lovely moon, mesmerize us... with your charm. My heart is searching for a dream... which can't be fulfilled. I am searching for my beloved... on this moonlight night. This romantic night and the beautiful atmosphere. Oh lovely moon, mesmerize us... with your charm. The moonlight is silent after evoking my desires. This atmosphere is not allowing me to sleep. Does anybody unknowingly remember... me in this atmosphere? Who fills my life with joy with his cute smile? This romantic night and the beautiful atmosphere. Oh lovely moon, mesmerize us... with your charm. The moonlight is silent after evoking my desires. This atmosphere is not allowing me to sleep. This romantic night and the beautiful atmosphere. Oh lovely moon, mesmerize us... with your charm. Two! Four! Six! Eight! Ten! Eleven and twelve. - Why is it more? - Why are you counting yourself? You're the father of all these children. Really? Now tell me why you counted the children. I was hoping maybe the number had decreased. Hey, how can the number shrink? Here the twelfth one is on its way! You're talking of the twelfth one's arrival... and the eleven were going. - What? - Yes, it's because of my bravery... that nothing happened. It's okay, okay. My dear children, you all would have... learned a lesson, had you been with me. And you would have seen that... your father isn't just a brave poet. What happened? Nothing, my poetry got stuck up. But is also a brave man on the battlefield. So, yes, my dear delicate Kavita... I swear by your fat body that as I was... returning from the poetry session... I came across dacoit Sultana. Oh my! What happened then? What do you think happened? The war continued for a full seven hours. And they fought! And fought! And fought! Hey, are you going to stop there, or finish the story? What is there to say? Nobody won the war. - Did you expect me to lose? - A draw? Yes, but does a poet ever accepts defeat? I picked up a stone and recited... beautiful poetry in his ears. The moment I read the poetry... the stone turned into an atom bomb. - Atom bomb? - Yes! And then I said, 'Where are you going, kiddo Sultana?' You are still a young lad. - He said he'd kill my children. - The children? Listen to me first. And then I challenged him. I said I'd defeat the whole world. He said he'd return one day to take revenge. Then I told him I'd break his nose. Nose! Nose! Children, I can't take any more. Then what do you want? I want us to go and apologize to him. Only then I'll be able to live peacefully. You can never trust a dacoit. You can never trust them. You want us to apologize? - Yes. - We all go and apologize? I already told you there's no one... except a young couple over here. - Uncle! - Yes. What's the girl look like? Look, I find it a bad habit to look at young girls. - Oh. - Not every man is an owl like you! It's okay. Okay. They aren't owls. But none of the men are as handsome as I. What! Do you think I'm so old? I'll hit beat you and break your head into four pieces! Listen! Listen! Listen! Listen! Look, we are very decent. We don't like violence. Speak plainly whatever you want to say. We suspect the girl has eloped. Yes, and we just want to make sure. I already told you they're husband and wife. Have you seen their marriage certificate? You've seen it? Tell me. - No. - Then how do you know they're married? Yes, you'll learn when you go to the city. These days young boys and girls go around as if married. What? Sir, what strange times have come? The ones who wanted to go have left us and gone... and have bluffed us. Oh God! Come, come with me. Hey! Hey beautiful damsel! Get up fast! What's the matter? Let me sleep. What are you doing? Let me sleep! - Something has happened! - Let it happen! - Do you hear that? - No! I'm saying some people have arrived and are looking for you! - What! - Go to sleep! Come in. Come in. Come. Listen, someone has come to meet us. - She's changing clothes. - Oh. No, I won't come. You don't care for your wives. I'm tired from the last three nights. - You awakened me. - You'll have to come. This isn't your father's house. It's your husband's house. - I'll go to my father's house today. - Who's stopping you? Go! I'll go to my father's house now! I'm warning you. Don't come. I'll marry someone else! Why are you scaring me. I'll send you to jail! Jail! Really, you'll send me to jail? Just try it!! This is what your parents taught you? Did you see? They've begun fighting again. Aren't they husband and wife? This chap has to suffer the same fate everyday! Yesterday a girl beat him badly. I think he'll get beat up today, too. You must have thought about it earlier. You must have thought about it earlier. What's the use of crying? You hit me! I'm sorry, madam. Go and make them understand. You created this mess, and only you can solve it. - Why are you sending her? - I'm feeling shy. - Go soon. - What's the point of crying? Okay, I'll go. Can I come in? What do you want? Leave! The matter is, where is your wife? - My wife? None of your business! - I wanted to apologize to her. - Apologize? Apologize for what? - I just want to say I'm sorry. - Oh! Apologize to her! - Yes. Sorry for what, buddy? We husbands suffer the same fate! You are absolutely right. You are absolutely right. We husbands work from morning to evening and... get beat up in the night. Yes, we're in a very bad state. And then the fingers get stuck in these chubby cheeks! Yes! Yes! I'm telling the truth. I haven't shaved till today. - Why not? - She shaves me every morning... with her delicate fingers. Well, didn't you shave today? Yes, I did. I got my first beating this morning... and this is my second. - Come on! I'll be right back. This world is full of cowards now. The wife beats while the husband tries to escape. Oh God! Oh God! Oh God! - What nonsense is this? - Why did you beat me? - You beat me first. - No, you did. - Shut up! - No, you shut up! Really, your parent's have spoiled you. - Eat your breakfast. I'll find a bus. - I'll come with you. I'm sorry, but I'm not one of those henpecked husbands... - who takes his wife everywhere. - I'm not your wife! One day you'll become someone's wife and may God save him! - Good morning, dad. - Good morning. Don't you feel ashamed to call me your father? In two days you'll become my father. - Any news about Baby? - No! It's really very sad. I'm not sad. In fact, I'm happy. At least she's away from a jerk like you! Jerk! This face has made so many women go crazy! Yes, maybe all the girls are blind these days! They only see the face and fall in love... but when they learn his true nature, they bash him up. I'm not one of those men. After all, why won't you try to understand? With your money and my fame... we can turn around the whole world. Sir, if you're so famous, can't you turn around the world... without my money? Because one can't turn around the world on fame alone. Whether you've turned around the world or not... you've certainly turned me around. But do remember, if you try to act smart with me... then I'll show you no mercy. Why not compromise with me... since you know you'll lose? I'm one of those people who fight till the end. I'll do my best to ensure Baby doesn't marry you. And if you're not successful even in this? Then it will mean the defeat of my destiny. She wants to leave! She wants to leave! So, leave! Who cares? That I'll suffer? Suffer! I'll even suffer along with you. I regret doing all I've done. Where'd you go? I asked where you went. To buy saris. To buy sari's? Women are so strange! They may not have money to eat, but still they go shopping. - How much money do you have left? - One rupee two annas. Enjoy! The bus won't go for another five days. Then? Then where will we stay? In the air, since the money's gone. Don't you have any money? I did, but left it at the Bank of Baghdad. Money or camels? Madam, don't talk so much! Grab your luggage and start walking. - So far? - Yes. But what will we eat? Silken saris! Hey! Hey Mr. Humanity! Yes, speak, beautiful damsel! What's your name? Anything, I don't care. - Please tell. - Sagar. Sagar? Really? It's your real name? - Which means ocean? - Yes. Any objections? The signs of water and storm aren't visible on your face? It doesn't suit you at all. Love makes people go crazy. Why live when you're one place and your beloved somewhere else? Hey mister! Why did you start being so informal? - Because you're younger than I. - Then I'll be informal with you, too. No, you'll be formal with me. Remember that. You! You! You! Go to hell! Mr. Humanity? Your brothers and sisters are calling you. Mr. Humanity! Please listen! I'm very hungry. - Can you get something to eat? - You're already eating. What else do you want? Listen. This is corn. I want something nice to eat. What's better than this? Millions live on this. And if you want something tasty, then take this. Eat this. Oh, so much! Why did you take the trouble? Sagar! Sagar! Now I'm very tired. I can't walk anymore. Look, there's a village nearby. Cross the stream and then... send a telegram to your father. He'll send a palanquin for you. Oh! That's not possible. Then keep walking quietly. Right now I'm very tired. You tire too easily. The villagers walk fifty miles daily. Have you noticed the poverty? Yes, and I liked it very much. - Then why are you crying? - No reason. Sagar, let me rest here for a while. So, you've become informal again? Come on, get up! Come on, get up! We have to get over there. Have your relatives built a bungalow for you over there... where you can go and settle down? - No. Your father's palace is on the other side. Look, mind your tongue! - Shut up! - You shut up! - I'll count to three. - Then what? Sagar, put me down! I don't like this at all. Put me down! Put me down! Why do you follow me wherever I go? With silken feet you sneak into my heart. Tell me, what is it you want from me? I have to answer the call of my heart. On the path of love, in quest of love. Don't ask me who's in control of it I'll raise a hue and cry, create a scene. Who are you to me, anyway? Go away from my doorstep. Stay away from my heart. Tell me, what is it you want from me? What harm have I done? I've given you my heart and asked for yours. Go and call some wise man. Let's get it solved right here and now. Don't ask me who's in control of it. Our hearts have gone crazy for each other. Who will now listen to me? Why do you follow me wherever I go? With silken feet you sneak into my heart. Tell me, what is it you want from me? Don't ask me who's in control of it. Tell me, what is it you want from me? What are you thinking? Are you still lost in that dance? Yes, wasn't it very nice? Yes. So close to reality. Met each other, danced and sang, and then were again separated. Go to sleep. - Sagar? - Yes? I'm hungry. Hungry? You've eaten so many grapes. Aren't you full?? Now eat me up, okay? I don't eat meat. I'm a vegetarian. Sagar, Sagar! I'm hungry. Get something to eat. You think I get scared, that I can't go anywhere? Look, I'll go right now and get something to eat. She's crazy! It was a very inauspicious day when I met you. Sagar. Sagar. Sagar! Sagar, where did you go leaving me alone? If I had died of fright, then what? I went to make arrangements for your food. Look, my heart is beating so fast! Okay, now tell me, are you very hungry or very scared? I'm neither hungry nor scared. You'll never be able to do any work. You've been washing the sari all morning. And it's not clean yet. Listen, I'm your husband, right? Not your washerman. I'm a poor man, which is why I'm washing your sari. If someone else did it, you'd know. Understand? Okay, fine. Hurry up or we'll lose the 125,000 rupee jackpot. Really! So sit behind. Come. You always talk to me like this. I'll understand. If you speak angrily, I understand nothing. Very good. Left, right! Come on, fast! All line clear. All line clear. Move ahead, walk ahead. Let the procession advance. There's a cannonball amongst us, so no fears. All line clear. Buddy, the line's clear. I have never missed the target. No one is a match for us. Ultimately the world had to bow its head to me. - Papa! - Hey, quiet! We're going along singing. Don't ask where our hearts are burning. Place us in your hearts. We are worthy of love. All line clear. Let the procession advance. There's a cannonball amongst us, so no fears. All line clear. Buddy, the line is clear. Hey! What now? Are you going into the jungle to die? Can't you stay on the road? - Do you know what's over there? - What? There are two graves. - Where? - Over there. You ask for any wish here and it gets fulfilled. - Really? - Yes. My mother couldn't conceive. - Then how did you take birth? - Listen. She came and prayed here. And I was conceived. Her wish was mistaken. My life wouldn't have been ruined... if you had never been born. Hey! If I hadn't come into your life... you would have remained unmarried. - Do you understand? - Mind your tongue! We're near the grave. Yes, we're near. Remove your shoes and then come. Where shall I put them, so no one takes them? Oh, one who solves everybody's problems. Oh, the one who is sleeping peacefully. If we find the lost girl? And if we hit the jackpot of 125,000 rupees. - We'll offer sweets worth five rupees... - worth five thousand rupees on your grave. Slowly, slowly, you will repent if your wish is fulfilled. Miser! I'll distribute sweets worth ten thousand rupees. 10,000 rupees? Listen, if it's like this, then very soon... you'll see a third grave instead of two over there. - What are you saying? - I wasn't saying anything. Okay, fine! Go closer. Hey, who removed the mud from the graves? - What are you saying? - I'm right. There were huge graves over here. Now they've become small. I think he's building a new one. What do you both want? See, he's become alive after seeing us! Our prayers have been accepted. Ask what you want to ask. Sir, you know everything about that girl. I know everything! You're searching for Sir Girdharilala's daughter, Kammo. - Yes, sir. - You'll receive a reward of 125,000 rupees. - Yes. - Then listen. You are on the wrong path. You won't find her here. - Then where, sir? - If you want your wish fulfilled... then listen to what the saint says. Leave here immediately... or else the girl will get away. Leave immediately, I say! Listen to what the saint says! This voice is coming from on high. Sagar! - We've hit the 125,000 rupee jackpot! - Our wish has been fulfilled! Shall we call the police or will you come with us? Get out of here or I'll teach you a lesson you'll never forget! Hey, you don't scare me! Let go of me! You'll be sorry! Leave me, or you'll be sorry later. Save your life. What are you telling me? What nonsense is this? - Stop your wife! - Why stop her? Now I'm enjoying it! Enjoying it? That girl is very short tempered and will beat your wife badly. Hey, listen! Listen! Listen! I've been waiting for this for four years. Let her beat my wife for four hours, at least! It will be fun! Very good! Wow! Great! Good! Be careful! Harder! Please look there. Listen to me or I'll beat you badly. Forget it! I've seen many like you! From that side! Very good! She's too good! Who is she? Good! Great! Great fun! Stop! I'll return soon. Very good! Hold it down. Hey lady, I don't know your name and address but... Hey, why are you helping her? Sultana sir! Sultana sir! I have finally found you. Hey! What are you doing, hold her. - Hold her! - Beat her! Everyone beat her! Everybody beat her! Good! Very good! Stop them! Stop them! Attack! Attack! Why are you beating me? Sultan sir! Sultan sir! Sir, your cap! - Thanks a lot. - I hope you've forgiven me now. My whole family is serving you. I'll write poetry in your honor now! 'Neither did I cry nor did I complain.' 'And you escaped quietly.' 'And you escaped quietly.' Oh no! One more new trouble. What happened? Out of gas. Come on. If it's not one thing, it's another. What happened now? I'm very tired. Don't get scared. Look there. Bangalore is only seven miles away. Only seven miles? Seven miles! We started from Madras. Who can stop the time? Yes, that was a long time ago. I wanted to fly there. And now Bangalore is only seven miles from here. And my legs are trembling. It's true your legs tremble as you approach your destination. I can feel something else. What? As though I'm alone going ahead... leaving my destination behind. Look there. The road forks up ahead. One goes to some poor village. And the other to the rich city of Bangalore. I'm impressed so much with the simplicity of the village... that the glitter of the city now seems phony. You still haven't lost anything. Agree, dad. You seem to have lost your appetite, also. - You're not eating. - You're standing before me. Sometimes I feel like eating the fruit... but sometimes I feel like eating you. We both belong to you! Put a marriage announcement in the paper. - Baby will return immediately. - I don't have any other option. You shouldn't waste any time. - Shall I go? - Don't bother. - Why, dad? - You'll dictate incorrect English. Wow dad wow! This is too much! I might make mistakes in my mother tongue but never in English. And yes, dad, if you need me I'll be at home. Woman is the main source of life. You can't lead your life without her. The main source is useless! Unless there's a brave man there to overcome the storm. - Understand? - Really? - Yes. So, you only know agression. Move aside! Take care. Yes. Be careful. Be careful! Be careful! I Be careful! I'm sorry, brother. It was a mistake. It's not your fault. I was born at the wrong time. - Who are you? - We are both travelers. Travelers. - We wish to stay here. - Then I was born at the right time. - For how many days? - Say... for two to four days. Who are they both? - Who is she? - You didn't recognize her? Oh! I think she's his wife. - Yes? - Your wife. Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! They are travelers wishing to stay here. First tell me who they are. Speak softly or they'll feel bad. I won't allow any stranger to live in my house. Look at her face. She looks like some trouble. Trouble! Why are you trying to insult her? Keep quiet, Mr. Madharilal. Or else I'll break two more of your teeth.. Who are you? - We are travelers. - Even I can see that! What is your relation to her? Why trouble them? - They told me they're married. - You shut up! Forgive me! I'm sorry! Tell the truth. Who are you? - Husband. - Wife. - When did you marry? On Tuesday, at seven o'clock in the morning. You can't both be husband and wife. - How do you know? - Wait! Move aside! Stand up straight. Stop breathing. Where are you going? Listen. I'll bet they're married. - How did you make out? - Look. If they weren't married, he would have screamed when I pulled his nose. And when I pulled his ears. And when I pulled his hair. And when I pummeled him. Hey, but he didn't scream. I've learned he's used to getting beaten up. You are correct, Mr. Madharilal. If they turn out not to be married... and if our name is again defamed in the village... then do remember, I will show you no mercy! Excuse me. You can discuss this later. May we see our room now? Kindly show us our money! Money! We'll give the money on the day we leave. If you don't trust us, we'll leave. Let's go. - They don't trust us. - No, sir.- I'm sorry. We thought we'd stay for two to four days. Then leave a tip of fifty rupees. It's not to be. Remove your hand! What are you doing? You've turned this place into an orphanage. Wherever you look, nothing but aunts. So many empty rooms. Move. Sir, please come. - I'll show you the room. - Listen. - Yes. - Arrange for some food immediately. Yes, yes, yes. - He's very hungry. - Yes, madam. I want homemade ghee with the food. - Sir, as you wish. - Where are you going? - I'll show the room. - Yes. - You go and cook the food. - Yes, yes. - Please listen. - What is it? - Do we have wheat flour? - Use millet flour for the bread. She beats me in front of everybody. Come now. The food's getting cold. You eat. He must be getting my meal. - There won't be a second plate. - No second plate? Why not? Just one plate of food for two people? Mr. Madharilal! Mr. Madharilal! It's the custom in India that... a married couple eats from the same plate. Husband and wife. Today we eat from the same plate. Maybe tomorrow you won't even recognize me. Who can say who won't recognize whom? Eat. Look, our fake wall has been erected again. Our life is so strange! Everything is fake. Relationships are fake. Husband is fake, wife is fake. Hey! What happened? What are you looking at? There's no one over here. - Hey. - Yes? - What are you thinking about? - Nothing. I thought that Sumanth had come and you weren't listening. I was thinking about the future. Who knows what the future will bring? Tomorrow will be so nice, right? You'll be with Sumanth in Bangalore tomorrow. Separated hearts will be united. That's what you were imagining, right? I was thinking about the ones being separated tomorrow. You shouldn't feel sorry for the ones being separated. You won't be sad when we separate? Sorrow is a weakness. And I don't like to show my weakness. Oh beloved, come and meet me in this starlit night. and turn this bleakness into heaven. The sky will start swaying. It's my heart's desire, oh beloved, to be taken to the stars. This place does not amuse me anymore. Come close to me in this romantic night. My loneliness calls out for you. The rays of the moon entice us to fall in love. Life is a journey. Who knows where we'll be tomorrow? Oh beloved, come and meet me in this starlit night. The forest will come to life. The sky will start swaying. It's my heart's desire, oh beloved, to be taken to the stars. This place does not amuse me anymore. I wish I could become a cloud and glide away. I would bring the sky shimmering like a bride down to earth. The moon would glitter, the stars would sparkle. The world would be joyous because two hearts have united as one. Oh beloved, come and meet me in this starlit night. The forest will come to life. The sky will start swaying. It's my heart's desire, oh beloved, to be taken to the stars. This place does not amuse me anymore. Sometimes a moment comes in love... when you can foresee what is going to happen. You can feel it. Do you know what it's called? Absolute madness! That is because rich and poor have differing emotions. You can change your destiny by studying the lines on your palm. Because you are rich. I can only read my palm but I can't change my destiny. After all, why don't you try to understand me? The wealthy are also human beings. They also have a heart which beats. They can only count their heart beats. They can't feel anybody's sorrow. You've only read fictional stories. You've written fictional stories. You cannot understand life. Maybe it's life that doesn't understand me. First you have to understand yourself before you can understand life. You'll have to convince yourself what you're noticing isn't a dream. It's reality. Reality? You're trying to teach me about reality? Hey! That's enough, now. Don't you know you'll be in Bangalore tomorrow? Stop fooling now! You'll never understand a woman. I hoped you'd have at least tried to understand... the one who has excused all your disapprovals. What will she go through if you approve of her? Which you won't get even from God or human beings. Kammo? Kammo, are you listening? You're right. I'm slow to understand. I'm crazy. Hey, are you angry with me? Listen. I've decided that we'll get married. In fact, today, and immediately. Hey, no! How can we get married today? You need money to get married. You know already that I have none at all. But don't worry. My editor lives in Bangalore. I believe he'll give me money. Listen Kammo, I think I have to leave now. I'll return by morning with the money. Till then, wait for me here. Kammo, please say something. Kammo! Sleeping? You didn't hear a word I said? Good. I'm going. I'll return as a bridegroom in the morning. But where will I find gas money? Greetings, sir. Sir. Greetings. Greetings. How many liters of petrol do you need? Not much, only two. You can take as much as you want. We have plenty. My name is Sagar, but I don't have the money to pay for the gas. If you don't have any money, then why did you come here? Listen, I have to go on urgent business. If you want you can keep my bag but please give me fuel. - No! - You can even keep my hat. Oh! Have a look. It looks very nice on you. You'll make heads turn wherever you go. - And if you don't come back with money? - You can keep the bag and hat. - I won't give them back, I swear. - I agree. Okay. - Who is it? - Your fan, Sagar, famous the world over. Okay. So it's you? Hey, what are you doing? If Sagar dies, it'll be a huge loss for the other editors. I have such important news, the other newspapers will beg to get it. Mr. Editor, this news is about Sir Girdharil's daughter. You got this news today? She's not marrying Sumanth. Is she marrying you? Yes, this is what I came to tell you. Have you gone crazy? Get out of here! - What did you say? - Sir Girdharil's daughter is marrying you? Yes. If you lend me one thousand rupees... I'll marry her immediately. - One thousand rupees. - Only a thousand. Get out of here! Get out! Listen, please listen Mr. Editor. This story is absolutely true. It's a question of my life or death. I'll tell you the complete truth. Listen. One bright morning I was traveling to Bangalore by bus. This girl had quietly escaped from her house. Do you remember when I called you up? This is what happened. I was sitting next to her. Hey, Dhano's dad! Hey, Dhano's dad! Listen, Dhano's dad! Come have a look at this witch. She's sleeping alone over here. I told you after seeing her once... that this girl was without character. Now, watch as I humiliate her and throw her out of the house. - What's all this noise? - Don't you feel ashamed talking like that? Shut up! Where's Sagar? I'm asking you. Where's that blot on your reputation? Has he deserted you after only one night? Aren't you ashamed to insult someone like this? Sagar, must have gone out. When he comes back he'll explain. Hey, what will he explain? His clothes, his suitcase, and his scooter are all gone. Wow! Very nice! It's a beautiful story and I'm excited. I'll give you two thousand rupees. But remember one thing. If the story is fake, I'll send you to jail. Sir, I'm ready to swear you can hang me if you like. Please give me the money immediately. Take this. Check. But I need cash. I have to pay the guest house bill tomorrow. I have to make wedding arrangements. This will take time. I know you're in a hurry. But do you expect me to keep two thousand rupees in a hotel room? The bank opens at ten o'clock. You can cash it then. Thank you. Thanks a lot. Sagar. Sagar. Oh, look at her face and look at her behavior. She's pretending to be a decent girl! Get out of here! I say get out! - Let go! - Go on. Get out of here! I should have poisoned you! Don't ever show your face around here again. If you have any shame, go and kill yourself. Yes, Sir Girdharilal speaking. Who, Kammo? Dear Kammo? Where are you, dear? Sir Banarsilal? I am coming there right now. Dear, I'll be there soon! Ms. Malli. Ms. Malli. I've found my daughter! Nathu! Nathu! Ramu! Raghu! Babu! Shamu! Get the car ready. I've found my daughter. I'm going to get her now. Yes, tell Malli also to get ready. Go! Go right away! - Baby! - Daddy! My dear daughter! Hey crazy! What are you doing? Today I have the most precious thing in the world. Most precious thing... Forgive me. Daddy. Today I have realized it's a very big sin... to run away from your house and not to listen to your elders. Something even God and the world can't forgive. Dear, but you haven't committed any sin. But the world thinks I have. Daddy, I have heard such words spoken against me... that I felt like I was dying over there. What do you care what others think? I'll create a different world for you. No dad, it's not their fault. It's due to my own stubbornness. Those older times were better. A girl left her home twice. The first for her marriage and second after her death. I think you've been hurt very badly. Do you know dear? Your dad hasn't eaten properly... since the day you left. Come dear, come on. Okay, sister, greetings. What did you say? You've found her? No, no, it's not possible. Yes, yes, yes. Your story is false. Who is it? Come in. Hey, I'm not telling you. I'll complain at the police station against him. I'll get him arrested. I'll send him to jail. So, do you still claim your story is true? Mr. Editor, sometimes God has some other plans for you. Sir, I put your money over there. Please forgive me. But listen, how did all this happen so fast? It can take a lifetime for a man to build his destiny... but no time at all to ruin it. Love was progressing but despair was smiling on me around the corner. At some point, she changed inside. But it wasn't she alone who changed. The whole world changed. - Sagar. - Yes? Take back the money. If there's no story, why pay me the money? I believe there will be a twist in your story. - I'll take the money then. - Don't be stubborn, Sagar. You're young now, with a long life ahead of you. You never know when you'll come across many such stories. Mr. Editor, I won't be so fortunate as to write such a story. To tell you the truth, I had written it with my blood. Now only tears are left, instead of blood. Can you write stories with tears? Sagar, all the famous love stories in this world... were written with tears and not blood. I have complete faith you'll write a better story after this experience. I'm giving you this money as an advance. Wish you good luck. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Here is our thief. Have him arrested immediately. - Why not? - Oh, you? Yes. So, you recognize us? Yes. I have many fond memories of you. Hey darling, this man has changed a lot in four days. As though he's forgotten how to smile. She's taken away my smile. His talk was so interesting. And today he's looking so sad. What's the matter? I was wondering how to see you again, and return your auto to you. Return what to us? You ruined it and now want to return it? Pay me a thousand rupees. What are you doing? Look at that poor chap's face. You're right. Okay, I won't ask for the money. Go, I forgive you. My Bhagwan has forgiven you. Thank you. I have money. - Please take it. - Okay, give it. Okay, come and pick up the luggage. Hello Kammo. I was dying to see you. Please Sumanth, I am very tired at the moment. Hello, hello. Yes. Just a minute. Sir, your trunk call. Hello, speaking. Sagar! Who Sagar? Money? Which money? Wrong number. I don't want soup. Go and get corn for me. Who's the idiot who told you to get corn? - Take it away! - I asked him to, daddy. You? Why? I have some very fond memories of it. The joy I derived from eating the poor man's food... I didn't receive from any other food. Is it so? Okay, dear... there will be corn in every dish, from today. Give me some, also. Let me also taste it. 'Gandhi-ji will repent.' 'He'll eat corn.' Kammo, what happened dear? Kammo! Oh my charming beloved... why did I give my heart to you? Why did I fall in love with you? My love for you is like a disease. Oh my charming beloved... When I think about you and remember... that face so dear to me... I regret having fallen in love. I am tormented by these memories of you. Oh my charming beloved... why did I give my heart to you? Why did I fall in love with you? My love for you is like a disease. Oh my charming beloved... My eyes are going crazy looking for you. I'm not able to relax, even for a moment. The brightness of the daytime stings me like a serpent's bite. With whom should I share my pain? Oh my charming beloved... why did I give my heart to you? Why did I fall in love with you? My love for you is like a disease. Oh my charming beloved... Kammo, what's the matter dear? What's wrong with you? Say something. Dear, you are under my oath. Say something. Dad, I'll feel even worse if I tell you about my sorrows. Dear. If all my wealth could bring back... your innocent smile then I swear on you... I won't mind spending it all. There are some joys in life which... you can't buy with money. It seems that love has affected you very badly. You can only feel the cool breeze... but you can't describe its effect. Dear, he's very fortunate because... the more I tried to keep you away from him... the closer you grew towards him. - Daddy? - Yes. - I want to tell you something. - Yes, please do. But, I don't know how to tell you. Dear, whatever you want to say... I've already arranged it. I wanted to tell you before eating anything... but didn't know how to tell you. Look at this dear. Whose wedding card is this? Please have a look. Wedding! My wedding? Yes, yes, with Sumanth. You love him, right? Dear, your love defeated my stubbornness. I will get you married with great pomp... and the whole world will see it. Dear. Please smile, dear. There. There, you have smiled! Now your lips are smiling. My dear. My dear. Dad, I'm very happy today. I'm very happy. I know it's a very happy moment for every father... when his daughter gets married. God didn't bless you with a son. He blessed you with only one daughter. He gave only sorrow to you instead of giving you happiness. Maybe I have no other option than getting married. And I am responsible for all this. No, dear. Dad, why did I take birth? Why didn't I die the moment I was born? Dear, why are you crying on such a happy occasion? I'm very happy with this wedding. If you're happy then so am l. Your joy is my joy. God bless you. The bride leaves for her beloved's home. The bride is feeling shy under her veil. Let the bond of your love remain intact. Don't forget us. Gone are the days of childhood. When I was young my beloved entered my life. Don't shed tears when the family is celebrating at home. Let the bond of your love remain intact. Don't forget me. It's the custom of this world. The one who holds your hand is your partner. We are strangers to you now, dear. He is everything to you now. May you always be happy. Don't forget me. I beg you never to forget the exciting swings of Spring. Dear, when you return, I hope you come with good news. Let the bond of your love remain intact. Don't forget me. The bride leaves for her beloved's home. The bride is feeling shy under her veil. Let the bond of your love remain intact. Don't forget me. I would like to thank all the reporters. Now I'm busy, so please excuse me. But sir, you have disappointed all the reporters. We've come from all corners of this world... to interview and photograph the bride. Sir, all the newspapers will be grateful... if we can interview the bride. And we'll take some beautiful photographs of her for our newspaper. Please! Please! Okay, fine. Though it's against our customs... I don't want to disappoint anyone on this auspicious day. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. What's the matter? Why the delay? Neela, please go and see. Greetings! Greetings! Why did you choose Sumanth, a pilot... as your life partner? - What? - It's said there's life elsewhere... and he'll take her for a ride there one day. Did your romance begin in the air or on earth? I remember nothing. How is love concerned with air and earth? One can fall in love anywhere. Is this a love marriage or an arranged marriage? We both consented. Now please excuse me. The auspicious time... for the wedding is passing away. Congratulations. Thank you. Congratulations, Kammo. Thank you. Wait, madam. I apologize, madam. May I ask some important questions? The time is finished. Your questions won't be answered. - Let's go, daddy. - Wait. Then I'll write everything about those four days... after you escaped the ship. I'll set the press on fire if you write anything about my daughter. What right did you have to return to Madarilal's guest house... to make fun of a poor man? My wish? I don't want to answer this question. - I won't give any answer. - You have to answer, beautiful damsel. Mind your language! Now I'm marrying someone else. I know. May God protect Sumanth. What's the matter? What do you want? - What's your name? - Sagar. And I want nothing. I just want my money back. - Money? - Yes. This is your humanity? Dad, give him however much money he wants. Very well, dear. Here, take it. 125,000 rupees. I don't want your reward. What, then? Here take this, read it. Rent of the guest house, five rupees. Cap and bag kept on mortgage, ten rupees. Seventy five paise for the carrots, radish and corn. Seventy five paise for the carrots, radish and corn. Total, fifteen rupees and seventy five paise only. Yes, I'm a man of principles. I'd have excused him, had he been poor. I agree with you, sir. - You seem to be a shrewd person. - Yes. Haven't you noticed how I've changed your daughter these last four days? Something you couldn't do in twenty years. - Well, excuse me. - I've excused you, excused you! I'll be right back. Then why did you leave me and go? Did I leave you or you left me? I had gone to arrange money for our wedding. - I left a note under your pillow. - Didn't you read it, or are you blind? - Apologize if you're ashamed. - Why should I apologize? If this wasn't your father's house I'd have broken your lovely nose. Hey, this isn't her father's house. This is your house. Slap her hard. Give her a good slap. - Where's Baby? - What? Dear Sumanth, today you didn't call me daddy? Dad, the auspicious time of our wedding is passing away. Not Baby's but, yes, the auspicious time for your wedding has passed. - What do you mean? - I mean that Baby has gone away. - Where? - With her beloved. The bride is going to her beloved's house. The bride is feeling shy under her veil. Let the bond of your love remain intact. Don't forget me. Don't forget me.
