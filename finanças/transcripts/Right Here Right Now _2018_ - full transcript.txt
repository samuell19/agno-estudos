A beautiful moment, a good ending. Credits please. Everyone's here, the whole family. Everyone's gathered around. We don't have to pretend. This is as good as it'll get tonight. And I'm worried I won't remember. We always wonder why we're even alive but in reality it's very simple. The only thing that counts is right here, right now. Right here, right now is everything. You have to be fully present. Because it's over in a heartbeat. Mathilda. I ruined everything. I was so stupid and so weak. Consumed by self-pity and hatred. And so in love with you. I couldn't believe that you were real. You said, "I love you," and I asked you, "But why?" How did you put up with me when I couldn't even stand myself? You've always been smarter than me. Markus, turn the music off. Kiezkalle, the chapter in which an unscrupulous asshole wants to spend New Year's Eve with me. Well then, my dear Oskar. That's not good. I paid him back ages ago. Hello? Don't you recognize me? Kalle Schwensen. Exactly. Usually, I would have broken one of your fingers by now for not answering your phone and for not respecting me. That's the impression I'm getting. But tonight you're giving me ten grand, or else I won't be so nice. And you don't want that, right? This is trespassing, Mr. Schwensen. I'll call for help, I'll call the police. I think you're crazy. I screamed my whole life and nobody cared. I'm 50,000 euros in debt, I don't think I can give you ten grand, Mr. Schwensen. Listen, I'm not here to make jokes, okay? Pull yourself together or you'll see another side of me. I'm expecting the 10 grand tonight and I expect you to answer the phone when I call you or I will break your finger. Understood? That's what I want to hear, my friend. And... I'm sorry about the door. Have a nice day, good man. Here are my problems, in order of importance: Today is our club's final night, Mr. Schwensen knows where I live, and my door is as broken as my soul. So, tomorrow I will leave this town, change my number and leave it all behind me. And I will forget about Mathilda. Fortunately, I won't have to be on my own tonight. I'm lucky to have Nina, Rocky and Leo. Nina keeps re-inventing herself. I think right now she's gone from nursery school teacher to being a painter. She'll provide the decoration for the club tonight. You wish. We are always told that every person has their own individual talent. And everyone's looking for it. "What's my talent? What's my talent?" But that's not my thing. You look like crap. Rocky opened our club years ago with his band Kid Kommander. And today he'll play the final gig. During all this, he's become a famous rock star, by accident. It's got nothing to do with being a rock star, I just don't have time to make music anymore. I've always wanted to make music and now that I can live off it, I end up doing other stuff all the time. But why do you have to paint it black? Leo is the girl with the big heart and the iron fist. Leo protects us. And our club doors. I just can't leave you alone. You needed to be here at 2:30 p.m., now it's 3:30 p.m. What are you doing with whom, and when will you be here? This is Pablo. Pablo is my business partner. Last night was the first night he arrived before me. And, of course, he's milking the situation. Everybody's enjoying it in their own way. It looks like you're moving forward, but really you're regressing. You're moon-walking through life. -Nino. -What? -Please can you turn this off? -Why? -You're a spoil sport. -Because it reminds me of Mathilda. Can't we talk about something else besides... "Mathilda! I want to get back with her." Everything's plastered with my mom, eh? Everything. Do you think the trees will die if they leave her on there for too long? -Probably. -And the birds will stay away, too. When they come back from the South to nest here, they'll need to apply for a visa. Rocky's mom is Senator of the Interior of this dying city. She installs surveillance cameras, introduces loads of regulations and destroys even our last freedom. And even here, everything will be neatened up tomorrow. It'll be a tavern for drinking beer with a hotel right behind it. End of story. Oskar, the keys. Two years of bills,Â disturbing of the peace, police call-outs, collapses, sleep deprivation and moments of great joy... that celebrated life...here, in the melting pot of searching souls. Can you get me one of those? Here, you can put it in the elevator. Everything alright? Everything's running smoothly today. Our memories are still stuck to every corner. Enno wanted to sort out the fridge. -You gotta kick his ass. -Enno! The club's never looked better. Alright? And, on our last night, we're all working for Kiezkalle. I have to tell Pablo about it. It's punk rock in its purest form. -Punk rock! -Isn't that the key word? You made me wait, but at least I was in good company. My little dick. What an amazing vibe there is in this room. How much is left in there? A coffee with three sugars. Um... I have to tell you something. This morning, a Mr... We'll close with such fucking huge debt. Such fucking huge debt, and you're only putting 100 people on the guest list. Did I hear guest list? Nice. -Hey. -Good to see you. -Take your hat off. -Can you prep a line? Off with your hat. Do you want a line or not? I asked if you wanted a line? Get out. Go on! -What's wrong, dude? -Get out. Look at you. It's New Year's Eve and you're wearing this ugly tracksuit! Get out. Dude-- Everyone used to be welcome, dude. What I wanted to tell you... Oh, we have to get ice cubes from the gas station. -Right. -No crushed ice. Never. You see crushed ice and you'll say, "Nope." You're allergic to crushed ice. Why don't you do it? You're the best partner. I'm going to miss you so much. Indeed. 10,000 euros protection money could throw even Pablo off his game. Party. And it would help no one if we both collapsed. What... what was the question again? Nina, turn the music down! The guys are saying they can't work. What are you doing? Oh. Oh that's the pizza delivery. I ordered pizza. Hello? Hello, my name is Kalle Schwensen. -I'd like to-- -Oskar's taking a shit. -Are you calling about the guest list? -What? I don't want to be on the guest list, I want to speak to Oskar. Not funny. -Tell him who's calling. He'll know. -I can't hear you. If he's not on the phone right away, he'll only be able to count to nine because I'll break his finger. I'll do it with utmost regret, but I will do it. Please do me one favor. Don't call again, okay? -And... leave us alone. -Trust me, I will call again. Kalle.... Schwanz... Schwanz or something. I know. Who do you owe money to? Kalle Schwensen. Why? Because he... lent me money two years ago. And you didn't pay him back? Yes, but-- Now he wants 10,000 euros. So, all he has to do is call you and you'll give him what he wants? He broke into my flat this morning with two thugs. Let him come here. He will. I'll handle him. Nina, I... I think you're capable of anything but not that, I'm afraid. Where is this dick? Hello! It's green. The phone's ringing. Your strategy... Just don't answer it. What did he want? Hello? Dad! Hello? Dude, my dad just called me. What did he say? I haven't heard his voice for two years, dude. Could we make a detour? Of course. Gosh... That's the only explanation. It was my dad. It must have been my dad. Didn't you say he was in a vegetative state? Yeah, he's heavily medicated constantly. But she took over his care because she didn't want to leave him in hospital. It's not very good for the election campaign. I'm banned from the house, I can't go in. Just act normal. Really normal. Drive a bit faster, dude. Not that fast! Okay, hang on. Woah! You can't just... Just drive normally, just how you would in front of your flat. That's not a house, that's a castle, dude. Yes. No wonder she installs cameras everywhere. That's my home. What's with those guard dogs? I'd like to talk to my dad. He's not in at the moment. Yes, he is. I'm not going to argue with you. Please. Bye-bye. You know my dad is in there, I know my dad is in there. And you're just lying to my face, sending me home. We're just doing as we're told. You're doing as you're told, dude... It's a fucking prison, dude. He's rotting in there. Come on. We'll go to the back of the house. Fuck me... That's my dad, dude. Hey. Come on. Get in the car. Go on, get in. Yes... I can't believe that you're here. Hey. This may be difficult to understand for people who don't know, but Rocky's father has never been to one of his son's gigs. From day one, he was against the idea of his son becoming a musician. He didn't want him to make the same mistakes he had. But that could change today. But he doesn't look as bad as you described. I still can't believe it, that he's really here. I'm a little bit worried that he'll... down seven short ones and collapse or something. We'll sit him down in the private area behind the bar with a bottle of water-- You're Rocky, aren't you? Please, can we take a photo? -What do you want? -What of? -A photo! -A photo! Well, of us! I'm your biggest fan... in the whole wide world. And the one that's drunkest. I don't want to take a photo. Please don't. Why not? -Because I don't want to. -Please. That's Rocky! Hey, Kommander! How cool is that, dude? Dude, what are youdoing here? -He doesn't want to take a photo with me. -Can't you see? I'm... getting ice cubes. No photo? You don't want to take a photo with this hot chick? She's my girlfriend, bro. Isn't your mother Senator for the Interior? Yes, my mom is Senator for the Interior. You guessed that right. She can't control her son at home, and that's why she's after the Antifa. Honey, come one. I'm getting the autograph you wanted. Dude, can't you talk to that idiot? What's wrong with him? -Hey... -Piss off. Boy, I'll take you down, dude. Girls, I just have to go over there for a second. Good to... I just wanted to call you. -I just wanted to call you. I--- -How nice. I even tried calling you, but I only got voicemail. We really do have a communication issue, my friend. I am really super busy at the moment. So, you're saying that talking to me isn't that important? I didn't say that, Mr. Schwensen. And what about the money? It... It's on its way. I'll tell you, if your girl... answers the phone for you one more time, I'll be very angry. Mr. Schwensen, you'll get your money, on time, tonight. Are you sure? Yes. Then all the best for your business. -Please, not that one-- -Shut up, girl. I told you, it'll cost you a finger if you don't answer the phone. We don't want me to break promises, right? I think it's okay if you break your promises once in a while. Karlheinz. Dad. Robert! Good to see you. Long time no see. What are you doing with those boys? Who are they to you? He's my son. Which one? That one. -That's your son? -Yes! You have no idea how lucky you are. You'd have one less finger if it wasn't for Robert. It's New Year's Eve. Take a day off, eh? All the best, my friend. Okay, let's go. I'm not going to ask you what mess you're in, alright? Are you okay? How do you know Karlheinz? I don't know him. Oskar? What? Mathilda. The chapter in which Kiezkalle stops calling for a while and I still get more than I bargained for. Oskar. How could this take so long? You're joking. I'm a huge fan. "Tintenfischmann" was thenumber one hit when I was born on October 23rd, 1991. Why don't you get usÂ a drink, Pablo? -Yes, do you want a drink? -Yes. Oskar, why didn't you say anything? Veuve Clicquot, the lonely widow who drowns her sorrows in champagne. Thank you. Ah, where? Where? Dude... alright? All good and you? -Hey. -Hey. Number 228. What does it look like? -What does the jacket look like? -Dark green. Everything's hung up shittily. I've got... -I've got everything under control. -Sure? Everything's under control. Don't worry. Okay, great. I'll go upstairs then. -See ya. -Laters. Bye! -Take one. -It's all getting too much for me. With whom? The stage is too small. I'll sort it out. I've put a crate down there, alright? Okay, thanks. No, I was still in Hamburg yesterday. Not again. Not today. Not today. Ten! Nine! Eight! Seven! Six! Five! Four! Three! Two! One! Dear New Year's Eve... I take it all back. I had no idea. Happy new year! Hugging is the best thing. We should do it more often. Hug people all the time. Did you get the message? -No. -Mathilda is on her way. HEY IDIOTS, HAPPY NEW YEAR! ARE YOU STILL ALIVE? I'M UP FOR A PARTY. LATERZ! PABLO IS CALLING 20 MISSED CALLS UNKNOWN NUMBER IS CALLING I will run my broken finger through her hair and say to her... "Mathilda, how nice." Let's go to the sea. Better yet... she won't come at all. Rocky. Or, "Welcome to the broken heart's club." Thanks everyone for coming... to celebrate the last night... of this amazing club. Please put your hands together for Oskar over there. Oskar! Do you want to say "Yes" to life? The next song-- Fuck your mother! "Fuck your mother"... Right. If you've got a problem with my mother's politics, I'd advise you to go vote. My mother has her politics, I have my music. Encore! Encore! Encore! Encore! Encore! Encore! Encore! Encore! Encore! Encore! Encore! Encore! Encore! Yes. This... was Kid Kommander's last gig ever. Mr. Rockmann? Dad! Put him down here. Put him down here! Someone call an ambulance! -He's having a heart attack. -Heart attack? Hey, Kid Kommander. Get us in, dude. Fuck off, man. Fuck off! Can I come with you? -You can come in the cab. -In the cab? Really? Hey! Let's drink. Here's one to life and two to death. Cheers. Come on! Let's dance! What's wrong with Nina? She's over the top. Or maybe we,Â the others, aren't high enough. Down it! Down it! Down it! Are you stupid? I've asked you if you're suicidal! Mr. Schwensen, it... it... really doesn't have to be... You're so unreliable, it really pisses me off! For ten people? Ten people. Hello? Can you hear me? I... I've got... -Can you hear me? -Yes, I've definitely got a table for you. -Good. -Maybe I could put you... -Good to hear that we agree. -next to the stage in the private area. And tomorrow, 3:00 p.m., I'll get the money, understood? Yes. No, this... You don't have to cut my finger off. -Please let-- -So think about it, okay? Would be a shame if you had to wear mittens in winter because you don't have any fingers. Don't disappoint me. Don't disappoint me. -Hello? -Understood. Are you puking? Unbelievable. He's throwing up. Listen... The squid woman. The chapter that's not on the guest list. I've got to tell you guys something. I've got to tell you something. -Who's coming? -Kalle Schwensen. And, uh... Kiezkalle. -Kiezkalle? -Kiezkalle. He's coming to... Yes, he's dropping by for a second. I've put champagne in the fridge for him. He's plus ten on the guest list. Please, just let him in. Don't make a fuss. -Why? -Are you kidding? It's not necessary. He barged into Otto's with his people, they smashed everything up, my friend lost an eye. Because you owe him 1,000 euros he's coming in-- -10,000. 10,000. This is not a joke. -10,000? 10,000 euros? He wants 10,000 euros from you? And you are giving it to him? You want to... I'm asking you... -Oskar, you want to give it to him? -Yes. I can't believe that you're so stupid! He will never get in here, seriously! Dude, I'd rather die. I'd rather die than let him in. Please, can you wait a second? Never, dude. -He'll never get in-- -What are you doing? I'm calling a few friends. He'll never get in here. -Only over my dead body! -How long do we have to wait? -Shut up. Shut up! -Can we get in, please? No. Shit. You said that right now? Who said that about getting in? Who said that about getting in? Who said it? We didn't say anything. All we want to do is party. Right... please let's... make some space here. Right. Line management here. Pea man... Princess and the Pea. Here's eight. That's 1.5, the till has another 500 for you. The fact that Rocky is leaving the band... Karlheinz Schwensen is going to turn up here at 3:45 a.m. -And why? -Cool, dude. Karlheinz Schwensen? Because we borrowed money from him a while ago. -Look away. -How do you know Karlheinz Schwensen? Look away. -What are you doing with those lunatics? -Well... -I met him in the Pubatsch club. -Why? -Because he's scared. -You're a cunt. Why didn't you tell me? Come on. I was in such a good mood. This is a sad face. Does Toby know about it? I just talked to Toby. He's already called the Antifa. -Really? -Nice! -Nice! Nice! Nice! -There you go. Yes, but I won't let it get that far. I'll give him the money before. Are you scared of the blue lights? You can give him the 10,000 together with your dignity, if you like. Or you could wait for the Antifa and the police, and Karlheinz Schwensen will be gone. We're not starting a war on the grounds of my club. Yes, we will. It's our club. And we'll look great with some blue lights. I don't think that's a bad idea. You can't give him 10,000 euros. -No. -No way. No way. You don't do that. -Better to call the cops. -Don't wear a hat. I wouldn't advise it. Yes, fuck the hat. Please, just deal with what's important. -For once. For once. -It's important-- Antifa never sleeps, my friend. Let him come here. Is that her? -Hi. -Erbse. You're Erbse, right? I'm Mathilda. Yes, I know. I know. -You know? -Yes. -Happy new year, Mathilda. -Happy new year. I've heard so much about you, but I'll tell you about it another time. There are three reasons why Mathilda could be here: She just wanted to see an amazing New Year's Eve party and ended up here by accident, she suddenly remembered that I existed and that she had the best time of her life with me, or she is pregnant. Some idiot impregnated my Mathilda, and now she's saying goodbye before she enters a life of responsibility and the joy of motherhood. That seems a bit stupid somehow. Wow. So this is your office? Yes. Wow. Well it suits you, Oskar. It really suits you. What exactly do you mean? I don't know, that's how I'd imagine your head looks like on the inside. Right. My head? -Yes. -My head? Yes. Which desk is yours? Guess. That one looks more impressive, I hope that one. Yes, that's mine. -No, it's not. -Yes. No, it's not mine. Shit. Okay. I didn't say a word. That one's really nice, too. Well, Oskar, cool, ey! -Your club! -Mhm. Wicked. Here. -Thank you. -There you go. Well here's to you. Here's to you. It's nice to see this. I've always wondered how you... where you are. Here. Yes. -Did you? -Yes. -Okay. -Yes. Fancy a cigarette? No thank you. Did you quit? Yes. I'm in this everything's new, everything's different kind of phase. -Yes. -Everything's new, everything's different, and now you're coming back... to me? Yeah. But, well... I've never been here. It's a bit chilly. Here? In Hamburg... I mean. Yes. Oh man, and now we're talking about the weather? -Yes. -No. -Please don't. -But the people are good. -Yeah. -The people are good. Yeah? Do you think it's stupid that I'm here? No. No, today is already... The whole day is fucked already. You're not making it any worse. -Charming. -Right? -Very charming. -It was meant in a nice way. Maybe it didn't come across like that. -It's great to see you. -Yeah, totally. How are you doing? Fine. And you? I'm a little nervous. So what are you doing here? Saying hi. Is that uncomfortable for you? No. Have you still got this... This... what? Did you fart? No! Have you still got the same, have you still got the same perfume? Yes, I've still got the same perfume. Why? -Yeah... -Do you want to smell it? Err... Yes, it is. Have you still got the same perfume? No. Do you mean the sweaty, unwashed perfume? -Yes. -Yes, I bought it again the other day. May I smell it? Okay, yes. Yes. I think... it's the same... Yes. smell. Good. -Shall I... show you the club? -Yes, show me the club. Okay, guys! They're here! They're here! They're here! They're here! It's on! -It's on! -Guys. -Hey! -Come here, you wankers! Come here, you wankers! -Oskar, what's going on? -Nice! Please go inside. No, I'm not going in now. What's going on here? Come here, you wanker! Come! Come on! Come here, you cunt! Come here, you cunt! Guys, hey! Nina! -What? -Stop it. I'll handle it. Yeah, we saw that. He's got boobs. Has he always had boobs? Did you invite her, too? Alright guys, back up. She's our guest. Who's moved the barrier? That's not acceptable. Mrs. Rockmann. -Hello. -Good evening. -Good evening. -Mrs. Rockmann. Mrs. Rockmann! Very nice to welcome you here on this beautiful New Year's Eve. Good evening. Happy new year to you. Please can you tell me if my husband is in there? Err... Yes he is... was... certainly here. Please can you get him for me? Err... I'm afraid I can't, Mrs. Rockmann. I'm very sorry. He-- He is ill and needs to come home. Do you understand? Come with me. Why don't we get him together? -That's shitty. -Dude, that's shit, proper shit, man! -Who else are you inviting? -Oskar, why are you standing there? With suit. The Senator for the Interior, she's my favorite guest. She's not Kiezkalle. It's not Bellevue, but it's still nice. I've just fallen in love with Rocky's mother. For you it may be new. No, it's not new. I know places like this. No dancing! This is the Senator of the Interior. Can we have a reasonable conversation in a quiet area? I'd like that very much. I would have torn this down. I'd like a new building. That would be logical. -And that's why-- -That would be logical to me. But you and monumental protection, you're both on the conservative side. -You want-- -I'm a conservative? You don't want to see it but it's true. You'll understand it in a few years. -You have to loosen up, Mrs. Rockmann. -I've got other things to worry about now. I'm looking for my husband. I'll get you some punch. Mr... Mr. Wro-- Mr. Wrobel! Hands! Where are your hands? Does she understand what's going on here? That there are no business logos that ruin the place? That a beer is only two euros, that the hourly rate is higher than the minimum wage. If she even gets a glimpse of the fact that almost everyone here has dedicated their life to an obsession, that they exploit themselves for a greater purpose, for art, for the adventure, for an alternative way. But all she probably sees are joints, wide pupils, this uncontrollable energy, and she's scared. And she should be. Hey. What's up with you? Wow! I cut myself shaving. That's where you shaved? Well, I'm a tough woman. Nina. The chapter in which I will lose the ground beneath my feet. Shall we put a little dinosaur plaster on it? And then we'll dance again. I'm not sure a dinosaur plaster will be enough. -And then we'll drink a shot together. -Defo! Okay? -But we should take you to hospital first. -No! No, no, no! Oskar, it's... it's an awesome party. And it's normal to hurt yourself. It's normal. -For you maybe. -Of course! I'll carry you to the office, okay? -Hello? -I'll carry you to the office. Okay, you'll carry me to the office. There we go... Keep it up. Keep it up! Fuck... What am I doing here again? I'll get you... careful... something to drink. There you go. Don't drink too much of that. I'll be right back. Right... Again... Okay. Watch out... There you go. Jesus Christ. That's... That was inside me? Err... yeah. Open your hand. Right... Take your finger out. And hold on to it. Hold on to it. Are you alright? Oskar... You okay? -Oskar... -What's up? Hold it. What's up? Oskar... Yes? Watch out. Take your finger out. Well done. -What's up? -I'm dying. Dying? No, I don't think so. Here, Ninutschka. There... look. A nice parcel. I'm so scared. I'll take care of you. I'll take care of you. I'm here, okay? I'm here. No, I have to tell you something. What? I've got a brain tumor. It's on my... brain stem. It'll suffocate me soon. And I've only got... three, four months left. And then I'm gone. I wanted to tell you another time, actually. I... It's so stupidÂ that I'm doing it now. Oskar... I love you so much. You've got cancer, Nina. You're dying, Nina. But it can't be. It must be a mistake. Everyone gets cancer. Other people get cancer, not us. Certainly not Nina. In a moment we'll wake up... we'll wipe the sleep from our eyes, go to the beach... and you'll... be talking about the colors of the waves... and you'll say that you can already see the picture, that you just have to paint it on canvas now. You won't even think about it. Just do it. No idea where Mathilda's gone. I wonder what she's doing here. I want her to leave. Just leave. Nina, wait. You can't walk. You've got a hole in your foot. Nina, your foot! You've got a golf ball in your head. You've got to see a doctor, Nina. Is that Mathilda? Is that the Mathilda that you-- Yes, that's Mathilda. Here's to you and to tonight. -Hey, put it out! -What? Don't you want to put the joint out? Why? You're not seriously banning joints now? Yes. I see! So only chemical drugs then! I thought you were pregnant. Seriously? Seriously. Oskar, seriously? Did you really think I was pregnant? You're an idiot! I'm not pregnant!Â Do you think I'd be in your fucking club if I were? Oskar! Happy new year! They're smashing the place up! They're smashing the place up! Come! Come, come, come! You have no idea what just happened. It's getting even better! Please, I have to go back! I've got good and bad news. The bad news is, the lift doesn't open. The good news, the Senator of the Interior is trapped inside. Hello? Mr. Wrobel? Mr. Wrobel? Are you here? Can you hear me? Come here, please. Mr. Wrobel, look at me! Hello? Mr. Wrobel, why don't you say something? Shut up, you asshole! -Mr. Wrobel. -It's rare. You don't get that everywhere. Open it. -Mr. Wrobel... -It doesn't open. Mr. Wrobel, listen to me. Listen carefully. This is false imprisonment and denial of assistance. -Are you comfy? -I've really-- Shut up, you asshole! I'm talking to Mr. Wrobel. Right, if you won't help me I'll have to call the police. If I'm not out in ten minutes I'll call the police. Understood? Oskar, get her out. It's not funny anymore. I'll call the police! We'll sort it out, Mrs. Rockmann! Oskar, get her out. Hello? Mrs. Rockmann-- -There's gotta be someone... -Mrs. Rockmann. -who's able to open this elevator! -We'll get you out. Hello? The door's jammed, Mrs. Rockmann. -Who else is there-- -Yes, I know that very well! That the door's jammed! I'll help you, Mrs. Rockman! -Mrs. Rockman, Mrs. Rockmann,Â I'll help. -It's a mix of pulling and kicking. -Don't get a shock, don't get a shock. -Three, two, one and-- Mrs. Rockmann, we're almost there! Keep calm. You can-- I've tried all that myself! -We'll get help,Â Mrs. Rockmann. -You've got ten minutes! We'll get help. -I'll never get help. -And remove that asshole. Remove him. Mr. Wrobel! Mr. Wrobel! Mr. Wrobel! Fuck, dude! Where's this coming from? It's not my fault, not my fault! Dude, shit! Who took a shit here, man? Andy! The shut off valve, you have to-- You have to turn it to the left! I'm going to throw up! I'm going to throw up. Oh my god, oh my god! What are you doing with the valve? You have to turn the mains off! I do all the dirty work, but I'm not doing the toilets! I'll punch you in the face! I'll punch-- You know what? I just put my hand down the toilet! I put my hand down the toilet! You are an idiot Dude, dude! Uncle! Stop! -Break! Time-out! -What? We have to find the shut off valve. We have to find the shut off valve. Oh my god! That was the toilet handle! That was the handle. Look over there, that's the shut off valve.. -Where? -Lower. -Where? -Lower. Now to the middle... Right there. Oh my god, you're finished! Got ya! Got ya! Rockmann! Amazing! You look good! You look great, Mr. Rockmann. I'll... play a gig for you now. You watch. The dead Elvis. The chapter of one guy's resurrection while everyone else drowns in ecstasy. -Dude, what an amazing guy! -Wicked! For a moment I thought he was dying. And what it looked like as the sun rose on the horizon. And my dad... was pushed on the stretcher -into the healing light. -Into the healing light. Hanna, nurse Hanna... -Yeah? -gave me Vasopressin. -That's more than-- -...be careful. We need something to drink. You look good. -You too-- -I have to tell you something. Guess who I've seen. Mathilda. No! Yes! Yes, I know. I've seen her too. -You've seen her? -Yes I have. -Then why are you here? -We have-- Why am I here? Well... -And what do they do? -Wake you up. -Good. -Good. Are you serious, about the band? I think it was my best decision in a long time. Yeah. I've never felt better. You really are a bit arrogant. Maybe. I've got to tell you something else. What is it? Your mother's stuck in the elevator. That's a lot of information. -My mother is here? -Your mother is here. My mother is here. She's stuck in the elevator and we can't get her out. Why is she... And you're not getting her out because you... -or are you in the process of-- -We're trying to get her out. But it's not working. Because the elevator is stuck? Since when? Man, are you crazy? It looks like you're enjoying the fact that my mother's stuck in the elevator. She went in there of her own accord. Yes, but you didn't get her out, that's the thing. But we've tried to. That's my mother. You'd have got anyone else out, but not my mother. That's fucked up, man. I'll get my mother out of there. -You? -Yes, you're going to go find Mathilda. Okay? So that's how it is when you find the love of your life again after 2,000 years. It's definitely Mathilda. But, for some reason, I don't feel anything. I have to save Nina... help Rocky... I have to take care of the party... I really need to be fully awake now, but all I want to do is run away. But then what is there? And who's this woman? What are you doing in there? Damnit! -What bullshit. -What? That really is the most stupid question you could ask me. Andy, listen to me. No, I'm not okay anymore. That you allowed for your dad to be here... for him to be in mortal danger-- -Are you crazy? You're in-- -You don't understand, Son! Quiet! -I'm begging you. -I'm listening. What do you want? Don't you understand? Have you gone crazy? You're the one who looks crazy right now. You're talking about reason, are you crazy? He's fine,Â he's better than he's been for a long time! I'm begging you! Do you actually hear what you're saying? -For god's sake, he's not well! -Here, look. I'll put the crow bar down here for you. There. Then you can take it and... I have no idea, dude. Really. I've got a brain tumor. A tumor. Wanna see it? Show me. There you go. So what does it look like? The tumor is beautiful. Thank you, I made it myself. There. And? -Looks good. -I'm feeling much better already, Oskar. I have to... one second... Sexy dude! Mathilda? I love you. Every woman I-- Do you want to-- Will you-- Just say it! Will you want to marry me? Squid man Squid woman Squid man Squid woman Come on! Squid man Squid woman Squid man Squid woman Fuck it. Yes! Fuck it! Do you need anything? I'm just gonna get some water. Just wait here. I'll be right back, okay? Okay? Two minutes. I'll be right back. Nice, dude. Open your mouth, Oskar. Trust me, trust me. Get in. Is everything okay? Oskar? Oskar! Talk to me. Hello? Can you hear me? Hello? Are you comfortable? Are you okay? Yes. Right. Doesn't look good the way you're lying there. Can you get up? I think you took a few too many, right? What did you take? Three. Pills? Shall we take some valium? Yeah? Stay calm. Two. And ah. Careful. That's Absinthe. Oskar. Don't fall asleep. Just breathe and-- Yes. Other nostril. Here you are. -How are you? -Good. And you guys? Why are you hiding? Oskar? -Is everything okay? -Yes. -Are you sure? -Yes. Look at me. -You're not at all, man. -What? -Open my eyes? -Yes. Do you want to... Shall I.... -Are you okay? -Yes. Okay. -I'm great. -Yeah? Yes. I have to talk to you. -What? -Because... I think you have to drink some water first. Here's to me. Listen... About the two of us-- It has to be over. What? It's-- I'm sorry to have to tell you that... that I feel like I'm being held back. -I'm holding you back? -Yes. For me at the moment-- I don't understand where this is coming from right now. What's going on? I'm sorry. You don't have to be sorry. Now is not the right time for this conversation. And... everything's fine. We're good. That's great. Yes. -Do you want some? -Yes. Thank you. Right... I've got to talk to Erbse for a second. -Back in a sec. -Sure. No problem. I just have to go out for a second. With the furniture over there-- Enjoy! -Thank you. -See ya. I'm really happy that you came, really. I just wanted to say that. I think it's important to see each other in order to realize that-- Have you actually met the others already? Yes. Great guys. -They are, aren't they? -Yeah. Absolutely. Yes. But I wanted to tell you something. I somehow... well I... I'd liked to... end this here... with us. There is no relationship that you can end right now. Yes, I'm doing it right now. I am ending the relationship. Oskar, I'd appreciate it-- I totally accept it and... right? But I'd like it if we could talk about this properly... when you're not so off your head. Call me when you need me, okay? You idiot. What was that? New Year. The chapter in which the weak are rewarded. Are you crazy or what? Are you crazy or what? Hey! Piss off, fucking cops! Piss off, you fucking wankers! Fuck off! Evening. Are you alright? Yes. -Are you okay? -Yes, I'm okay. Do you need a doctor? No. Thank you. What took you so long? Well we're very busy tonight. But still, Happy new year. You too. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. -You can go, thanks. I don't need help. -Sure? -Yes, thank you. -Okay then, bye. Listen to me. I never want to see you near me again, understood? Alright. Please. So much for love. Why does everything always have to get out of hand? Happy new year! Gracious. Gracious. Look at her. Are those the last ones? The last people... to let their sweat drip on this floor. Which in return will drip from the ceiling. -Yes. -I've loved it. Shame Nina isn't here right now. -Yes! -Absolutely. Where is Nina? No idea. I haven't seen her for an hour or so. We should get someone to call her. I'll go look for her. -Are you--Â Tell her we're missing her. -I'll look for her. -Good luck. -Laterz. Vincent can Gogh cut his ear off, yes. Did he cut his own ear off while he was drinking absinthe? We don't know. The fact is, that it's a substance of love. A substance... of friendship... and mental energy. Come on. It won't get any better than this. There's always the question of what life's actually about. Because you forget everything in life so easily, but what life is really about... is right here right now. Right here right now is everything. -Amen. -Amen. Nastrovje und gracias. What's that smell in here? Yeah, what's going on there? Oskar. Oskar. -Is that fire? -Get out! Guys, where's Nina? Nobody's seen her. I haven't seen her for ages either. Where's Nina? Guys, guys, we have to get out. Hey, guys! Get out! Calm, stay calm. Oskar? Nina! Is anyone up here? Is anyone still in here? Hello? Nina? Nina! Nina! Hey Oskar, did you make it into the new year alright? Brilliantly. So, do you have the money? I don't have the money. Doesn't matter, my friend. Dude, where is she? Where is she? Where is Nina? It's alright, it's alright. Did you see her here anywhere? Turn off your fucking camera, dude! We should call the fire department-- Where is she? Where is she? I don't know! Nobody does! Let's wait for the fucking fire department. There, there, there! Nina, are you okay? -Move her away from here. -Move her over to the wood. Put her-- Put her over there. Put her over there. On the wood, on the wood. Has anyone got water? Has anyone got some water? -Wait, wait-- -Has anyone got some water? Nina's laughing. Everything alright? You justÂ carried Leo out of there, dude. Like an undertaker. That's how you do it. -Let's have a smoke. -Yeah, dude, let's have a smoke. Here some confettit, dude. We certainly don't owe the fire department.
