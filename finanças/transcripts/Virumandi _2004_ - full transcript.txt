My name is V.R. Krishna Iyer. I was a lawyer, then a minister and later a judge. I am 88 years old. I say this out of my long experience. The law of death penalty has to be abolished. It's not my opinion alone. It is known from the time of Buddha. Mahatma Gandhi has said many times that... Only God can take away what He created. Not the Court or the State. My name is Munusamy. I've hanged 46 persons so far. Do you feel any guilt? What? Do you feel guilty for taking away so many lives? I did initially. Later, I looked at it as my job and felt no guilt. This is a Manila rope. We always use a new noose. We use this black cloth to cover the head to avoid seeing the facial distortions. Why subject the officials present through all that? Maarappan. Death row convict. I was the Head Master of a school for 30 years. There was a commotion in the class room. It was the Correspondent's son. I warned him. He didn't listen. So, I hit him and he fell down dead. I'm not committing a sin. This is a job that God wants me to do. I was upset and wanted to kill myself. But, my wife advised that a teacher should not set a bad example. So, I surrendered to the police. The court proceedings were long and delayed. I've been given the death penalty now. A mercy petition was submitted. I have no idea about the status. I don't have a noose around my neck. Yet, I'm swaying between life and death. We ensure that a death row convict dies with dignity. I don't understand the dignity in dying like this. If I had known I would get the death penalty, I would have hanged myself at home. My name is Angela Kaathamuthu. I'm at the Central prison. I'm doing research on whether the death penalty is necessary or not. We obey the law not for the welfare of society... but for fear of punishment. This is the truth. To maintain law and order in a society, punishment is essential is one view. The law itself is not working is another view. Like men, the law has been wrong many times. There are historical evidences supporting this. The law has been generous in rewriting many judgments. But the law doesn't allow one judgment to be rewritten. That's the death penalty. Move. My name is Paykkaaman. I passed the examinations in 2000, was promoted and appointed as sub-jailer here. What is it? A loose nail in the door. Excuse me for a minute please. -Ok. I think we have to call it a day. Let's continue tomorrow. We will get permission first. Never mind. Is the camera turned on? Turn it on. I'll start right away. I'm Narayanan. Death row convict. I am to die and I have to say a few things. Many atrocities are happening here. Paykkaaman tortures us. Whatever is prohibited in a prison is allowed here. Mobile phone and drugs go around. The jailer is a good person. But the sub-jailer... Did he talk? The death row convicts are moody fellows. They act emotional. But they are full of lies. You could have spoken to me. You've left the lens cap behind. Will the channel telecast this? Wouldn't they be afraid to? Definitely. They will telecast this. We have to worry only if it's a government channel. I'm planning to bring more tapes tomorrow. What if there are more like Narayanan? You could have been arrested yesterday. I was so nervous. My palms were all sweaty. You have a doctorate in 'civil law'. Whereas, I have a doctorate in 'golmaal'. Wait and watch what happens tomorrow. What about this shot? Mark it as important and keep it safe. Let's decide later. Let's not get into trouble. Let the jailer know that Angela is here to meet him. They are here to meet the jailer. I want to clear up this mess during my tenure. Sir, the lady interviewer... Send her in. Stop giving explanations. Please be seated. What happened? The convicts are on a fast inside here and there are people protesting outside. Please don't record... -No. He won't. Even a small incident will do. But, this time it is a death. Any custodial death, we will be held accountable. That said, will you finish your interview today? -Yes. Please avoid the area where you conducted the interview yesterday. I've organised this block for you. Please finish your work today. We just have a few more. We have to finish one that we left halfway yesterday. Which convict is that? Headmaster Maarappa Gounder? The death row convict. Nothing. Please wait outside. There is a great deal of confusion here. To sort it out, we need help from committed people like you. You can't interview Narayanan. Why? He fell sick yesterday and died on the way to the hospital. The convicts suspect foul play and are... Can you hear them? Sir, the relatives are here to collect the body. I'll be there in 5 minutes. Narayanan was a rowdy and was the worst of the lot. Wait. When you see ladies, open the whole gate. Please come, Madam. The person who died is a rowdy and they are on a fast as if he was a 'Mahatma'. The jailer is a nice man. But, that won't do. You need an iron hand. The direct IPS officers won't have it. Officers like me who rise up from the cadre will have it. Do you see them fasting? I'll come. Wait. Please come, Madam. I think you are upset because you can't interview Narayanan. I am not. Don't worry. There is a more interesting case. The two convicts we are about to meet have killed 24 people in Theni district. They tried to kill each other. Now, they are both in here. One fellow got the death penalty and the other one a life sentence. You must have heard about the Virumaandi case. I was the one who investigated that case. You are going to meet the second accused. Virumaandi's archenemy. I'm Kothaala Thevar. Chinna Kolarupatti. Theni District. Life sentence. Life sentence. Go on. Even before Thirumalai Nayakar, Sundara Pandya Thevar ruled the land of the Pandyas and as his descendants... Talk normally. Don't go into history. Not needed? No need. What is your opinion about death penalty? It is definitely needed. It's Ok if 10 innocent people like me die. But murderous criminals shouldn't roam free in this country. But the law says 10 guilty can go free. But one innocent man should not be punished. We respect dharma and destiny more than law. Dharma has destined him to die. That's what law says too. What can you conclude? God is there. Who should die according to law? That fellow? -Who is that? Virumaandi. I can't even say that name. Don't judge me by my face. I might look like a villain. But he is the real one. He instigated the fight between the two villages that turned into a bloodbath. Which two villages? Chinna Kolarupatti and Nallamma Nayakanooru. Two beautiful villages... [Kothaala Thevar] The Jallikattu was held in Nallamma Nayakanooru that year. Nallamma Nayakan killed my father and I went to prison for that. Everyone knows this. We have a hostile relationship. Still, I put aside my personal hostility for the sake of both the villages... and attend such village festivities... extending my hand of peace. Greetings to the men, women... and the brave bull tamers assembled here. The Jallikattu is about to start. The temple bull comes first. If you want to win, don't touch this bull. Pray to the temple bull. The bull is here now. Move aside. The temple bull is here. The temple bull is here. Don't touch. I warn you. Don't touch the bull. Apply the sandalwood paste. Move aside. Allow it to go. Our Nallamma Nayakan's bull is next. Do you know its name? Veerapandi. Nallamma Nayakanooru bull. Listen carefully. Don't make noise. Our villagers shouldn't try to tame it. The bull is named Veerapandi. Who dares to tame Veerapandi? It's named after Veerapandiya Kattaboman... the chieftain who waged a war against the British. The bull named after the brave chieftain is here. I dare you to tame the bull. Our bull has been tamed. That was so easy. Nayakar is watching you. What happened to your bull? -I think it's not well. It seems the bull is not well. What happened? Stop saying all this into the microphone. It's Ok now. The bull is Ok. You've tamed the bull. They'll give you the prize money. Collect it. It's not about the prize money. This is a game of valour. Valour! Why are you holding the tail then? We give an inch and you take a mile. Everybody is on the bull. Ask them to release it. Shall we reward him? Sit down. Shall we give him a watch? Sit down. Listen, brave bull tamers... the bull you've all been eagerly waiting for is here now. What's the name of the bull? Annalachumi's Sorimuthu. Sorilachumi's Annamuthu! Stop it! They'll cut you to pieces. The bull belongs to Kothaala Thevar's niece Annalachumi. Why are they saying my name? They should announce the bull's name. Get ready now. It's no ordinary bull. It butted 50 men in the Alanganallur Jallikattu. A bull that butted men even when it was confined. It had butted several men in the Karadikal Jallikattu. The ambulance is here. You can either get into the ambulance or into the arena. Listen, brave bull tamers. Chinna Kolarupatti villagers shouldn't touch the bull. That's the condition laid out. Annalachumi's untamed bull. Just like the owner, it will gouge out your intestines if you try getting close to it. Those who dare... The brave ones get out of the arena. Else, the bull will find out what you had for breakfast this morning. Watch out. The bull is here. Watch out! It's charging to attack. Careful. It is running to attack. It's ready to attack you. Watch out! Don't stand in that corner. You are an easy target. -It threw him up in the air. -Attack him. I'll kill you if you throw sand into its eyes. Don't just stand there. Run away. Maybe there is a cow inside. Chase out the bull. This is embarrassing. Send the cow out and the bull will follow. The villagers from Chinna Kolarupatti shouldn't tame the bull. Please don't. Why shouldn't we? That's the rule. Your villagers shouldn't try to tame the bull. Is an outsider allowed to do that? Outsider? Who is that? Our friend from Singapore. Supputhai's grandson. Your friend from Singapore! Who is that? -Supputhai's grandson from Singapore. He can try to tame the bull. Let's see. Virumaandi, come down. You have to win, Virumaandi. Come down. Shall I? [Kothaala Thevar] The enemy does not jump down from the sky above. He is the one who we encourage and allow to grow. There were rumours that Virumaandi's father and Nallamma Nayakan were the ones who killed my father. I didn't believe it then. I was naive. Ready! I'm Ok. Only the Singapore fellow was allowed to tame the bull. Why are all of you on it? Where is she? Do you accept defeat? She did. Move. Gulp it down. It stings. Must be good alcohol. Hey, Bully! I've been calling you. Didn't you hear me? My mother named me Virumaandi. You call me by some other name and expect me to respond? You could say that. But everyone knows you only as a bully. What did Nallamma Nayakar tell you? I heard he sent word through someone. What did he want? He wanted to buy my land. What did you say? The same reply that I'm going to give you. What was your reply? My land is the only one that gets water at 20 feet depth. I respectfully told him that I won't sell it. I just asked about the land. Where are you going? We are on our way to Theni. Who said so? -You did. No. I'm going somewhere else. Drive now. Does he think this road belongs to his father? -Move it. -That belongs to grandma. Who cares? Just move it. [Kothaala Thevar] Virumaandi had come home drunk and wanted his grandma to cook for everybody. To wake her up he had poured a bucket of water on her face... and she died. A silly prank ended in a terrible tragedy. What happened? Come here. What happened? Grandma was sleeping. He poured water on her face to wake her up. He poured cold water on her face. What's the point in crying now? She's gone. I just got back from Kandamanur. Give me the dhoti. Move over. [Kothaala Thevar] Virumaandi's land was the last one near the lake. Beyond the lake it was Nallamma Nayakanooru. If he could get hold of Virumaandi's land, he could get complete fishing rights and access to divert ground water. After Supputhai's death, I knew Nallamma Nayakar would somehow buy that land. I was right. Virumaandi, stop drinking. Do you want to get buried along with your grandma? You have no one now. Stop roaming around with these ‘Gubeer Jolly’ brothers. Start making some money and get married. No. Like my uncle, I'm... Uncle... I'm going to get into agriculture. Would that alone do? What about a wife and kids? No. When I want a wife, I'll go to a prostitute. Is this how you speak to a police officer? You are drunk today. That's smart! The police officer found out. Don't stop with that. Cut me here as well. Like he suggested I'll get buried along with my grandma. Forget I said that. All arrangements to bury your grandma have been made at the burial ground. Whose grandma? Your grandma. I see. You can bury your grandma there. I've found a place for my grandma. I'm going to bury her here. Where? Inside the well? That's not in our custom. She is not a god made of clay. Don't contradict what I say. I'm going to bury her in my land. Are you crazy? All of you leave now. You can shave his hair later. Watch out! There's a well. That's my well. As if I won't know. - Of course you would know. Nallamma Nayakar is willing to pay a good amount of money for our land. I see. If you bury her in your land the value of the land will depreciate. So, if I bury my grandma in my land, you'll arrest me? The police will arrest me. Is it? Calm down. It's just between the two of us. I won't arrest you. I'm just saying that the value of the land will go down. I value my grandma more. I don't care about Nallamma Nayakan nor Kothaala Thevar. They are all here. Uncle, come here. My uncle and I are going to cultivate this entire land. Are you going to be a farmer? You see me as a farmer? I need to see a doctor! Brother has got into a brawl. Please come. He will listen only to you. You fellows get him drunk and then say he is in a brawl. Wretched fellows! Hurry up. Virumaandi, you are drunk and brawling. All the elders are here. Come with me. You people pray to three gods. My grandma taught me to pray to five gods. Land, Water, Sky, Wind and Fire are the five gods. You forget to pray to one of them, there will be a famine. The top part of the crop is for us, the mid part is fodder... the root is left in the soil. That's why... we have water at a depth of 15 feet. Like vampires those rich fellows have sucked out all the ground water... and the rest of them in this circle have to dig borewells up to 250 feet depth for water. Don't talk about all this. Please listen to me. I'll listen to you. I won't talk like that. I didn't mean to disrespect the elders here. I am going to do agriculture here. Get lost! There is a spring of water in the place we dug to bury grandma. Where are those respected elders? Come here. I called those elders. Why are you coming, uncle? Virumaandi, listen to us. You have to do the final rites. You can't behave like this. We can take a look later. Leave that and come. Do you see this? This is not water. It's my grandma's blood. It's her blood. She toiled on this land. This is not just land. This is my grandma's body. You dare fix a price for this. Don't ask for this land. This is my grandma's body. Don't glare at me like that. Get lost! Let's leave. Tail-wagger! How dare you threaten to charge me? This is my grandma's land. Get lost! This is my grandma's body. Don't antagonise Nayakar. It does no good. He has goodness only in his name. Not in him. Even if Nayakar pardons him, I think he will kill himself by drinking. That's even better. Nobody to claim the land. But the panchayat will meet at Nallamma Nayakanooru. As if he will play fair. I'm sure you'll use your tactics, negotiate and get the land for Nayakan. -Don't... -Didn't you talk to him? -No. It was something else. -I know. You were a bully even back in school. Brother, only my police station is at Nallamma Nayakanooru. But, my heart belongs to Chinna Kolarupatti. Thevar, ask me whatever you want. I won't forsake a person of my caste and negotiate for one of another caste. Let me handle him. You won't have to do anything. Nallamma Nayakar would have drawn a plan by now. What happened? What is it? What happened? He is hurt. What happened? You are bleeding. -Someone stabbed Virumaandi. -I expected this when he antagonized Nayakar. You are right. I think it was one of Nayakar's men. I couldn't see clearly in the dark. I think I saw Nallamma Nayakar with a sickle. You didn't see clearly. So, don't bring up a respectable person's name. Don't you see where he has ended up for blabbering? Are you trying to start a fight between the two villages? No. I think I saw him. Take him to the hospital. Hurry up. This way. I think he has gone this way. Who is it? Quiet. Come here. Who let the dogs loose? Who is here? What happened? Don't come out. Some problem between Nallamma Nayakan and Virumaandi. Don't come out. Keep the kids inside. Don't even peek out of your window. Close the door quickly. Move aside. None of you should get into the vehicle. I don't see the sickle that was on his back. That is evidence. Isn't it? As if that's important now. By God’s grace... [Kothaala Thevar] How would we know what our destiny is? I prayed for his well-being. He recovered after two months in the hospital. I thought he would have reformed. But, he didn't. He came straight from the hospital to my house to ruin everything for me. Stay back here. Sir asked you to come inside. Please come, Virumaandi. How are you? -We should be asking you that. Hello. You carry on. God has been kind to you. Do you understand? What are you looking at? You refused to sell your land. I hate to depend on others. Even if I have to dig up to 300 feet, it's my house, my well. I'll definitely get water. You won't get water. Move your hand. Stop it. Don't dirty my dhoti. You wouldn't be able to joke if you'd died.. Obviously! How would I if I were dead? Make more wisecracks. I heard it. Nallamma Nayakan heard it too. And you know the consequences. I'm digging a well here. Whereas, he dug a pit for you. That's the difference between a respectable person and a petty one. Allow him inside. So noisy. We are having a conversation here. It seems you told the police that you don't know who stabbed you. I asked you a question. I was drunk. Didn't see who it was. The whole village had seen him. But you didn't. File a complaint against Nallamma Nayakar. Leave the rest to me. Nayakar's men will negotiate the land. Don't sell it to him. That land is part of our village. Understood? Are you going to use a knife? It's summer. He'll get a burn. Stop it. Apply some powder. Its summer. Where did I stop? Apply powder under the arm. Keep quiet. You stopped while discussing the land. Sell your land to me and leave for Madras. You've come from Singapore. You won't be able to manage here. What are you saying? I'm here for a reason. I'm indebted to your family. It's not about money. I have 10 lakh rupees in the bank and I regularly get interest. I came here to tell you that the water in my land is all yours. You are asking me to leave. I thought I could partner with you. Partner with me? Why? You want to know why? Annalachumi was the one who saved my life. She was the one who wrapped me safe and took me to the police station. Annalachumi. Annalachumi... What is it, uncle? This is not for you. Is this true? What? Move aside. Feed the big dog. I asked you a question. About what? About me. So, you didn't tell him. Be it an animal or a man, when I see it dying, I can't be heartless. That dog won't bite. Don't get agitated. You said it won't bite. But it did. What's that noise? Did you turn on the motor? The beehive! Oh, no! They broke the beehive. Take him to the shed. Do you have a matchbox? Please can you unleash the dog. Poor thing. May I have a 'Beedi'? It's stinging. Why did you let the bull run loose? How long can you be in the water? Virumaandi and Annalachumi are coming together. I got stung by the bees. Your face is swollen. [Kothaala Thevar] Annalachumi was naive and young. I didn't know what her intentions were. He is a bull tamer. I think he used the same tactics to woo her. I should have cut him off then. But, I didn't. Some more please. Serve some more. I wonder how you digest all that you eat. That's rude. Don't make fun of him. I'm not making fun of him. We feel like we're cooking for an army. Stop talking, Annalachumi. That's Ok. What she says is true. I overeat only because she cooks tasty food. You can scold me as much as you want. But, don't stop cooking. You haven't washed your hands? You cleared the muck and came straight to eat. Get up. Go wash your hands. I washed my hands. Didn't I? She won't let go. Go wash your hands. My stomach is growling. Hurry up. Oh, no! Serve me first please. He's not well and has no appetite. Pour the water. Careful! Are you a cannibal? Stop it. Wash your hands again. [Kothaala Thevar] He's very good at sweet-talk. I fell for that and made him my partner. Like a bug attracted to light, Annalachumi was lured into his trap. No wonder we couldn't find them there. The two lovebirds are here. [Kothaala Thevar] They say, 'You give an inch, they'll take a mile'. He took advantage of the privileges I'd given him. I pretended not to notice it for Annalachumi's sake. I asked him what would people think if they saw the two of them together? He got drunk and tried to attack me. Are you crazy? Why don't you shut up? Let him talk. How dare you disrespect him? Stop it. [Kothaala Thevar] If I had killed him then... twenty four men wouldn't have died. Annalachumi and my wife cried and pleaded for him. He escaped from the jaws of death. After that kind of a behaviour will saying a sorry do? I was a useless fellow! For the sake of Annalachumi, I forgave him. After the case is closed, you and Virumaandi... I'll get you both married. I've made up my mind. I'll announce in the panchayat. We are going for Nallamman's panchayat tomorrow. Nobody will dare lay a finger on you. Don't be afraid. Leave it to me. Afraid? Me? I've thrashed a Chinese fellow in Singapore. Not everyone with small eyes can be Bruce Lee. It's Nallamma Nayakan's panchayat. You speak as if it's Thirumalai Nayakan's panchayat. Wait. That's my son Peddaraasu. He goes to the court every day. He has to because he is a lawyer. I first went to the court 18 years back. If your father was alive now he would tell you the reason. I went to meet Kothaala Thevar's father Thavasi Thevar... to make a truce on behalf of your father and it ended up in a fight. Thavasi was the one who took out the sickle first. But, I stabbed him first. After four years in jail, I came back and... made a vow I'll never touch a sickle again and never step into court again. I've stood by it till now. That's the reason I have the reputation of being a respectable man. It's only because of that vow Kothaala Thevar and you are still alive. I don't need that pitiful life. I'm as good as dead then. I challenge you for a fight now. Are you ready? Don't try... My son won't touch a sickle. But I will. My son saved your father's life. Stop it, mother. Have you gone crazy? Stop provoking people with your antics. It's a false allegation. Withdraw your complaint. What? False allegation? You asked for my land. I refused. So, the respectable man resorted to using a sickle. Calm down. I will talk. So will my sickle. Listen. I have something to say. -Go ahead, son-in-law. I won't sell my land even if you give me crores of money. Coimbatore Kondaraasu sitting right there has a full well. If you are dying of thirst, why don't you take water from his well? He will sell everything readily. Did you say I will sell everything readily? Do you see that person sitting there? Acting innocent. Kothaala Thevar. He will sell everything readily. Mind your words. I am here as a witness. Don't provoke a fight. Kothaala, if you have the guts, fight with us directly. Don't shoot off Virumaandi's shoulder. This is a gathering of respectable men. Why are you talking to him? I gave the complaint. Talk to me. If this is a gathering of respectable men, I'm one too. Let me make an announcement in the panchayat. I'll donate a share of my property for charity. Tell Nayakar to do the same. I'll accept he is a respectable man. Do you even realise what you are saying? Donation, Charity... Am I going to take it with me when I die? I will give. I'm giving a portion of my land and the well to the people of Chinna Kolarupatti. I'll give it in writing. Now tell Nayakar to give away something. What do you want in writing? When he was the Zamindar the whole village belonged to him. What do you know about his generosity? You speak in rage. When you actually have to do it, you won't have the guts. When I give my word it is as good as giving it in writing. If Nayakar can't do it... let Kondaraasu his man-Friday donate a bit of his land. Didn't you get it for free from Nayakar? So, why don't you give it back to him? Poor man. He has no water. Look at his dirty dhoti. How dare you speak to him like that? You say he is a wearing a dirty dhoti. But you are the dirt. It's Ok. Let him talk. How dare you speak about him? Weren't you whipped and sent to jail for troublemaking in Singapore? I know everything about you. Every small thing about you. It seems he knows everything about me. Oh, really! I feel itchy now. Tell me where I feel itchy. I don't know where you feel itchy. But I know that when Kothaala Thevar feels itchy, he uses you as a tool to scratch. But, I'm not a tool for Nayakar. We are like family. I'll give away my property to whoever Nayakar tells me to. I am ready to give away my property unlike... Kothaala Thevar who would give up his family for property. He wants your land and water. So, he gave up his niece. If he can get some more property, he will even give up his wife. Stop it. I will kill you. You threaten me with a sickle. But, I'll kill you with my bare hands. [Kothaala Thevar] I didn't know if it was my karma or whether I was cursed. But, God had decided to test me. That moment, I realised I was going to face the consequences of his actions. Get into the car. No one saw this. I endured everything and stood by him like a lightning rod. Get into the car. It doesn't matter whether he abused me or you. I should have killed him. Why did you hold me back? How could he say that about a good woman? That you pimped her? You should have killed him. He said you pimped... Stop it. That fellow just said it once. I think he is going to put up posters everywhere. Annalachumi is coming. Don't tell her anything. She will blame me for everything. I have to hear her scolding because of you. What happened, uncle? I heard you caused some trouble. I didn't do anything. Please tell her, son-in-law. You want me to tell her now. Some time back you told me to keep quiet. Your aunt... His wife... -Please.... -Don't touch that. Whose is that? Belongs to Ram. Konraas is going to have a crowning ceremony for that. Please come here. -Where? Why? For what? I asked you a question and you just walked away. I'm really angry. Let me go and find out. Keep my sickle ready. I have to take care of that fellow... You wanted to sacrifice a goat for the deity. Right? I'll bring Konraas. -I know you're capable of that. -And you won't spare that. [Kothaala Thevar] It's normal for a person to get angry and then calm down after some time. But his anger was like the wild forest fire. Where is Virumaandi? Wake up. Virumaandi has gone out alone. Hurry up. We have to help him. [Kothaala Thevar] By the time I could get there Virumaandi had picked up a fight. I had no choice but to fight. Don't allow them to escape. Kill them. son-in-law. [Kothaala Thevar] In the blink of an eye he killed Konraas in a ghastly manner. Let's go. In that blinding rage he attacked me as well. By the time I could calm him down my men were in the fight too. Spare no one. Kill everybody. You dare to fight with us. Virumaandi was blinded with rage. He didn't know right from wrong. Help! My baby fell into the well. By the time he calmed down many lives were lost. Stop it. Why are you both fighting? He openly said that we were his family. Even if he was a murderer, how could we give up on him now? Leave now. -Has he gone crazy? He started hitting me. I was trying to help you. I don't need your help. Don't hold me back. I want to kill him. Stop it. Don't allow him to escape. Kill him. You allowed the witness to escape. He is getting away. Catch him. What did the baby do? I didn't do anything. -You didn't do anything? Someone who looks just like you killed them all. I didn't do anything. Stop it. You said you were with us. So why are you denying it? Don't lie. Virumaa, leave him. Listen to me. Go see who it is. The police are here. Save my husband please. We can talk about this later. Virumaandi is innocent. Nobody can do anything. I'll accept the blame to prove that you are innocent. Hello. Hello, Sir. What happened, Kottaichaamy? Nothing. Nothing? Go in. I brought the witness with me. Shall we have the enquiry here or at the station? Let's have it here. Come inside. Please go in. You are the lawyer. Virumaandi, don't worry. Leave it to me. The eye witness Ramaras agreed to come here because of us. We have to take care of him. Just repeat whatever you were taught. He is a good judge. Maintain silence. Tell them to keep quiet. Were you with Konraas on the day of the incident? No. I was in Madurai. Did you go to Madurai? Or did you go to get money from Kothaala Thevar? Do you know about Nallamma Nayakar's negotiation with Virumaandi for his land? Don't nod your head. Speak up. Yes, Sir. The negotiation ended in hostility. Do you know that? Yes, Sir. Nallamma Nayakar tried to attack Virumaandi and a complaint was filed. The case is still pending. Do you know that? Yes, Sir. That's a separate case. What did he say? -He says it's pertinent. He says it's pertinent. Do you know that Nallamma Nayakar tried to buy back the land that he'd already given Kondaraas? Yes, Sir. Did Kondaraas give back that land to Nallamma Nayakar? No, Sir. So, Nayakar could have got angry with Kondaraas just like how he got angry with Virumaandi? Give me an answer. Yes, Sir. In the case filed by Nallamma Nayakar, the accused arrested under Section 302... Virumaandi Thevar, Kothaala Thevar, Kottaichaamy and others... are acquitted in this case because of insufficient evidence. Further, the Court orders the police to conduct an investigation and find the criminals. The whole village was against him. But I thought of him as family and helped him out of a criminal case. I don't need his loyalty. But how can he betray? Forget betraying me. How can he betray Annalachumi? He betrayed her. I would have got them both married. But, he is a brute. Annalachumi was not an ordinary girl to cater to all his whims. She is from a big family and didn't oblige to him. So, he kidnapped her. I brought her up like a princess. He brutally hit... He thought he can get away by playing on emotions. That didn't happen. Justice was served. Please keep this confidential. Please don't telecast it. It's about a girl. No. We won't. Over? -Yes. Let's go, Kothaala. There's a belief that getting photographed reduces your life span. My death penalty was reduced to a life sentence. Go ahead and take a photo. When will it be telecast? I'll let you know. You can leave. Lock him up first. Only then open his cell. Let them not be anywhere near each other. Else, it will be a riot. Are you from Thanjavur? Yes. Proper Tanjore? No. I'm from Kilvenmani. Sit down. Sit down. Behave properly. Don't cause any trouble. Understood? Stop glaring at me. We are all tools. You are being interviewed. It will be telecast. Can we view what we shot just now? Why? He will be hanged in two weeks. That's why. I'll play it for him after the interview. You were a part of this investigation. So, please can you wait outside? You will be able to see it here. I'll play it for you after the interview. It will be a distraction now. Are you ready? Turn it on. What is your opinion about death penalty? I've posted the warden outside. Ok. You had kidnapped a girl by name Annalachumi and raped her. Then you have... Every action will have a motive. What was the motive...? Can I ask you a question? -What? Can I ask you a question? Go ahead. What's your size? Turn it off. I'm here as a humanitarian. I don't believe in 'If you've killed, you have to be killed.' I'm not a wealthy woman doing social service for entertainment. I want the death penalty to be abolished. So, please respect that feeling. If you have any other decent question, go ahead. First give an answer to my question. Answer Madam's question... No. I can't give an answer, Mr. Virumaandi. Why? When you go to buy one, the shopkeeper asks for the size. Wouldn't you tell him? I will tell the shopkeeper. But, to the fellow who raped a girl... But, not to the person who raped a girl. Likewise, I've said all that I had to in Court. I don't have to talk to a female who's strolled in with a camera. Don't get upset. I meant her. Not you. What is it, Madam? -Nothing. I understand. Answering these questions doesn't help you in any way. But, it will be of help to others after your time. That’s why. -Hey! Take your camera and get out! As if the warden can hang me now. I'll call him myself. What? Tell Paykkaaman that I don't want to talk to these people. Take me back to my cell. Madam, let's leave. Please wait. Why? Who are you angry with? Why do you retain so much anger when you are going to die? Is it the fear of dying that causes anger? What do you know about dying? Stop it, Virumaandi. Stop it. All of you know what fear is. I don't know what fear is. That was my only wrong. Turn off the light. I told you not to record this. Anger, justice, death penalty, Annalachumi, myself, noose around the neck, dying. What would you know? You've just read about all this. You wouldn't understand. I understand. I know. What do you know? -Will you please listen? My father in this very jail... was hanged to death. His name was Kaathamuthu. He worked hard to educate me. He borrowed heavily to get me married. I was Angela James after marriage. In order to protect me... he killed James, confessed to the murder... and was hanged to death here. I'm now Angela Kaathamuthu. Dr. Angela Kaathamuthu. Doctorate in civil law. Being hanged to death, dying by strangulation. I understand it all. Madam! Please wait outside. Madam, call out if you need help. The door is kept open. Do you know what this is? I don't see anything. -I'm asking you what this is. No. Please tell me. My lifeline. My destiny. Remembrance of Annalachumi. Her nail marks. They would have told you I raped Annalachumi. Do you know who Annalachumi was? She was my wife. If she was with me now, I wouldn't be here. If she were a witness the lies wouldn't have won. Destiny. My destiny. My mother died when I was 12 years old. My father then took me to Singapore. I led a happy life there. He later died. I got into a small trouble and had to come back here. My grandma was the one who brought me up. She raised me as a winner. We don't realise what happiness is when we are happy. When we lose everything... you realise it then. My gang and I won the prize money at the Jallikattu, had a few drinks and were getting back home. Gulp it down, brother. Must be good stuff. You wanted to get thrown by a bull and die? If that's your wish, here... A bull tamer? You? Were you waiting for it to butt you? Oh, no! Blood. -So what? I have plenty. Supply it through a pipeline then. I thought I tamed the bull and turned around for a minute. It knocked me down. I'm sure you would've turned around to look at a girl. Stop laughing. He's a grown up man now. Don't scold him. Apply this. I don't care who you are. Get lost. I told you to watch from the electric pole. Did I tell you to take part in the Jallikattu? The electric pole? Did you want him to get electrocuted? Shut up and take back those words. If he dies I have to live a lonely life and die. All of us have to die one day. Shut up. I'll break your mike. Enough of your threats. Come and collect the prize. You keep it. I don't want the prize. If he had died, would you give your life? Would you? Yes! We will give you plenty of money. I'll get it from sir. Sell your land to sir. Name your grandchild and let us die a peaceful death. Let us die... You want to die too? You ugly fellow! You want my land. Is it? You'll use chemicals and spoil the soil. Our way of farming is different. Only my grandson can farm my land. Don't think he doesn't know how. I'll teach him. I was the one who taught his father. Don't think he is useless. He is very clever. Just like you... -Useless fellow. Ignorant fool. Let's go. The three of us? Your vehicle can't carry the three of us. Will it? Is it feigning some illness? Where is your chain? -She has a good memory. -Start your vehicle. -Ready? -I'll sit in the middle. This bull can sit right behind. Are you seated? -Yes, grandma. I'm holding on. Running beside you. You can't leave. I'll kill you. Better come and eat. We were given 1000 Rupees as prize money for taming Kothaala Thevar's bull. The bull is of no use now. Quiet. Grandma is sleeping. She won't sleep this early. Grandma... Don't pretend to be asleep. I too will pretend to believe it. I'm going to tickle you on your tummy. Grandma, bananas and 1000 Rupees... our winnings. Showing off your acting to me. Is it? I'm going to throw water on your face. Don't, brother. What if she dies? She didn't wake up. Check and see. Brother, let's take her to the hospital. Stop the acting, you rogues! She's left us. She's gone. As if you don't know. What did you tell me? What did you say? When I buried my father, what did you tell me? You said you'll be there for me till I settled down in life, that you wouldn't die until then. My mother is gone too. What will I do now? Answer me. You said you'll live for another 10 - 25 years. You liar. You said you'll be around to see my children going to college and only then die. Didn't she say that and laugh? And I believed her. What will I do now? Supputhai, get up. Get up. Get up. Like my mother... Took care of me like a mother... What am I going to do now? She's left me and gone. Like a mother... [Virumaandi] In our villages people get stabbed in fights mostly over land and women. I got stabbed in a fight over land. For the water in the land. Who is it? Go. Who let our dog loose? Who is there? What happened? Don't come out. Some problem between Nallamma Nayakar and Virumaandi. Don't come out. Keep the children inside. Close the door. Quickly. Wait. Hey, Virumaandi! Didn't I warn you the other day? Who stabbed you? I have to write the FIR. [Virumaandi] While in the hospital, I felt that every breath of mine, I owed it to Annalachumi. I was bed-ridden for a few months. You were able to tame the bull. But were you able to tame your heart? She seems a nice girl. I had dreams of grandma and Annalachumi visiting me often and taking care of me. You keep this coin. Eat this tablet. You won't feel the pain. Sister, give him the medicine. Open your mouth. Your friends are here to see you. You can see him. Brother, how are you? Do you need anything? Annalachumi... Annalachumi! Our brother is back to normal now. [Virumaandi] After discharge I went first to Lachumi's house. Grandma was right about what she said in my dreams. I tamed the bull. But, not my heart. The bull is tame now. The bull has been tamed. But that... Be careful. If you hurt my bull, I'll cut you to pieces. She'll cut you to pieces and make 'Biriyani'. I meant you. Not the bull. Come here. -Coming. I called the bull. Oh, your bull. Sorimuthu, she called you. Come. Come. Did you see that? It obeys our brother. It listens to your brother. Is it? Wait here. It obeys only me. Acting tough? You donkey. A donkey? I thought it was a bull and we won the prize for taming it. Stop talking. Else, I'll cut off your tongue. He says, he can't speak anyway and to cut off his tongue instead. Stop it. You are spooking it. Who's spooked? The bull. Double meaning dialogues from you idiots. Pass me my trousers. Times are changing. There will be rumours if they see a bull and a girl together. You're right. Let's leave. That's why I'm going along with the bull. I have to protect her name. The bull has to be protected too. Please go on. Wear your trousers, brother. We'll leave then. Get lost. Quiet. He is sharp-eared. Do not touch my vehicle. It was steep and I just helped. Why are you getting angry? I'm here to thank you. Can't you say a few kind words instead of scolding me? Do you want me to give you an earful? I got a new life because of you. Why not an earful from you? I won't fall for this exaggerated talk. Leave now. Why should I? This is my land right here. Your place is farther down. What happened? Hey! What are you doing? Finding out the problem. Clean the spark plug and try starting it again. On the pretext of repair, you'll come closer... you'll meddle with the plug and then meddle with me. and I'll fall for you. Right? I don't need your help. I can manage. Ok. Carry on. You want to get stabbed again? If you stab me whom will you get to marry then? You're right. I can't wait to get married to you. I'll get married into a wealthy family and live like a queen. Why would I get married to a bully like you? What's wrong in getting married to a bully? You'll give birth to a tiger cub. I want babies. Not cubs. I'm ready. How many do you want? You seem ready to help with childbirth and name the child. Of course! I'll name him Puliyeru Padiyaan. What? That's my father's name. Sounds a mouthful! If you want an easy one. Then let's name him 'Banana'. I think we'll have a rosy baby. So let's name him 'Red Banana'. She's laughing. Chandrabose? -What? How about that name? -Stop it. You are talking nonsense. I'll name my child Tendulkar. That's not our kind of name. As if Chandrabose alone is our kind of name. But he's such a great man. Great man? Can he score a century, hit a sixer? He can't do all that. He only hit the British. Don't touch my bull. The train will be here any minute. It will get run over then. The only train that passes through comes here to run over my bull? You're right. All your answers are right today. Why fight over this? Let's name him Tendulkar. Otherwise, you'll go around the village complaining. That would be embarrassing for me. What will the pet name be then? Tent? Shameful! -What is it now? I'm discussing the name I want to keep for my child with you. She has finally understood. Don't touch my bull. Wondering whether I'm allowed to touch at least the bull. Shameless bull. Why are going you behind him? I'll deal with you when we go home. Will you deal with me when I come home? Why? I'll be coming home often. For what? Your uncle and I are close to each other now. I might have to visit him often. You are alive with God's grace. You still haven't learnt a lesson. The termite when it gets wings will keep flying until it dies. That's you. Really? As if we are going to live a thousand years. I'll live happily till I die. When talking to Annalachumi I felt my heart flutter. -She's fallen for you. -You're lucky. Careful. We pray for good rains and a fertile land. The goat nodded its head. Do it now. They were looking for you. They went ahead with the sacrifice without you. I know. Then, why didn't you attend the ceremony? I didn't feel good about it. Offering the goat? Yes. You made mutton curry yesterday. All of a sudden, you don't feel good. Is it? How to make mutton curry otherwise? I know. But, when I see the goat being offered, I think of you. What? You should think of me when you see a tiger... not when you see a sacrificial goat. How come? I can't help it. I have a medicine for that. Why did you wipe your mouth? Don't you like me? Did I say so? Will that do? That's a relief. I can't force a girl to marry me. Let us not... No to what? This or marriage? Let us not do anything. What's wrong? I think my uncle is watching us. Don't look immediately. How did you know? I'll tell you. Tell me now. -I'll tell you after we go home. The sickle that was used to stab you. It's from this house. Read out the name. 'Ko' Kottaichaamy? Look at it properly. It's my uncle's. Son-in-law! Where were you? I've been looking for you. Are you crazy? A sickle with your name... was used to stab me. Explain. Are you suspecting him? Quiet. You keep quiet. Let that fellow explain. How dare you speak without respect? Wait! I can explain. This sickle is mine. Don't you remember, Kottaichaamy? We had left our car at Nallamma Nayakanooru when it broke down. You remember? Didn't we file a police complaint that our belongings were stolen? Did they not deny our allegations in the panchayat? This sickle was in the car. Don't you see how sly Nallamma Nayakar can be? Do you realise Nallamma Nayakar's devious scheme? He is jealous about our close association. Why are you giving me that look? I thought of you as a brother and you suspect me? My brother suspects me... I can't bear this. This was the sickle used to stab you... Please don't. Annalachumi is not to be blamed. Anyone would have thought the same. I'm not angry with you for suspecting me, Annalachumi. Don't you believe me? After the case is closed you and Virumaandi can... I'll get you both married. I've made up my mind. I'll announce it in the panchayat. We are going to Nallamman's panchayat tomorrow. Nobody will dare lay a finger on you. Don't be afraid. Leave it to me. Afraid? Me? I've thrashed a Chinese fellow in Singapore. Not everyone with small eyes can be Bruce Lee. It's Nallamma Nayakan's panchayat. You speak as if it's Thirumalai Nayakan's panchayat. I can handle it myself. You don't have to go to that wretched panchayat. If we don't go, they'll think we are cowards. We have to go. We definitely have to go, son-in-law. But watch out. They'll try to stir up trouble. Be tactful with your answers. Do you understand? The way I see things, Annalachumi is going to turn him into a henpecked husband. He already is one. The bull has been tamed. [Virumaandi] I didn't listen to Kondaraas who pointed out that Kothaalan was using me as a tool to scratch when he gets itchy. Instead, I got angry and it ended up in a fight. It doesn't matter whether he abused me or you. I should have killed him. Please come here. Why? For what? I asked you a question and you just walked away. I'm really angry. Let me go and find out. What is it? I'm talking to you and you ignore... Anyway you don't listen. So, what's the point in talking to you? Move. Give way. I see no difference between this animal and you. The minute I open the cowshed, it will charge out to attack Just like you. Ok. I thought you were making fun of me. They aren't making fun of you. They are mocking you. We need blessings from the elders. Not their curses. Who do you think are the elders? Do you mean Nallamma Nayakan? He was the one who stabbed me. You didn't see him. Nor did I. Did you? Did you see him? Ok. Forget that. Why did you hit Kondaraas? I wanted to tell you. But Kothaalan stopped me... He bad-mouthed your aunt. He did not. He spoke the truth about my uncle. There is no difference between you and this animal. You better grow up. Else... But for my grandma no other female dares to speak to me like this. I dare you. I have to take over your grandma's responsibilities as well. Don't think I'll play the role of a wife alone. Understood? Ok. So what should I do now? Withdraw the complaint you filed against Nallamma Nayakar. You'll then suggest I apologise to him. One who forgives is a man. One who asks for forgiveness becomes a respectable man. Are you implying... That I'm not a respectable person? So, you don't think of me as a person? I can't change you into one. It has to come from you. What should I do now? Just say it and go. Enough of drinking. Eat and go to sleep. Who is it? Who is it? It's me. Virumaandi. Wait, Konda. I didn't come here to pick a fight. -Then why are you here? What do you have in your hand? Your slipper. There's nobody here with me. I came by myself. Why are you here? Stop there. Listen to him and leave. Carry on with your work. Listen, Konda. A man... She said something... Who? One who forgives is a man. One who asks for forgiveness is a brave man. Ok. I'm a 'brave man'? Are you a 'man'? Take your slipper. Take it. Without a pair you have to hop on one foot? So? I'm a 'man'. Come in. Where? -Sit down. Sit down, 'brave man'. Carry on with your work. Hey, Ramaras! Sir? The coffee shop should be open now. Bring some coffee for us. Not from your shop... I warn you! He's a drunkard. The baby is crying. Go check on the baby. That's my wife. This is Virumaandi. Don't be scared. He's here to apologise. My slipper. Kothaala Thevar and his men are coming with sickles. You tricked me. -Please listen, Konda. You dared to throw your slipper at me! Are you crazy? I came here to make a truce. That fellow is dead now. I'm coming. Leave no witness. Kill them all. Don't spare anyone. Even the children. Open the door. Help! Save us God. My baby... Has he gone crazy? He started hitting me. I was trying to help you. You allowed the witness to escape. Are you crazy? Catch him. My baby is gone. My baby is dead. I'll kill you all. Stop screaming. Why did you slap me? There are 20 men out there with sickles. They'll kill you. Let them kill me. My baby is dead. Where has he gone? God had intended this to happen. Let's bathe and then leave. No. Let us leave before he brings the police. I want to wash away the blood. No. Let us leave now. Ok. Let's go. Let's leave. Let's not fight amongst ourselves. Tell her to step aside. They have arrived. Step aside. Move. Hello! Please give way. Please don't touch anything. Please don't touch. All this is evidence. Nayakar, I want my baby. I want my baby. Bring back my baby. Oh, God! Why did you save only me? I want my baby. She is the only witness. How can I file a case based on her testimony? She's lost her mind. Wear your shirt. It's hot and stuffy. -Go to school. Get my shirt. I’ll bring it after I send them off to school. They don't have to go to school for a few days. Why? The school is in Nallamma Nayakanooru. Things are not Ok between the two villages. They wouldn't hurt children. There are other children going to school. None of the children from Chinna Kolarupatti will go to school. We have nothing to lose if they don't study for a few months. I knew this would happen. You put an end to Kondaraasu's family line! You've ruined the whole family. Leave now. Just run! You have to keep running the rest of your life. You can’t hide from the police. I didn't do anything. You didn't do anything? Someone who looks just like you killed them all. What's got into you now? Something that none of you have. I've come to my senses. Nallamma Nayakar's men are going to kill your husband and... he is to be blamed. You enticed me, made promises... and I already feel widowed. I didn't do anything. You came along with us. You can't dodge now. We went together as a gang. Whatever it is, we have to stand united. That's enough. Sir, what if he tells the police. Stop lying. Why take the blame for something I didn't do? I rather kill you now. You and Kothaalan killed everyone. Yes or no? Yes. That's true. I want the truth. Say it now! We... Myself and Kothaalan... I killed everyone. I killed them all myself. You did not kill anybody. Leave him. Listen to me. Did you hear him? I didn't do anything. Save my husband please. We can talk about this later. Virumaandi is innocent. Nothing will happen to him. I'll confess to prove that you are innocent. You don't have to prove anything. I am innocent. You are guilty of murder. That's the truth. Hello! Hello, Sir. What happened, Kottaichaamy? Nothing, Sir. Nothing? I brought the witness with me. Shall we have the enquiry here or at the station? Let's have it here. Please go in. You are the lawyer. Virumaandi, don't worry. The eye witness Ramaras trusts us. We have to take care of him. You've joined the winning team. Don't worry. I'll take care of you. Have you eaten? -No, Sir. Prepare food to eat. Come here. Nayakar insulted me in front of everybody. -What did he say? He said 'You know the truth. But, Kothaalan has bribed you'. What was your reply? I swore that I didn't. It's good we promised you a bribe after getting the work done. Else, you would've made a false promise to him. I didn't kill anyone. That will be the verdict in the Court. Am I right, Paykkaaman? We have to cook up a plan to get that verdict. Why cook up a plan? I didn't do anything wrong and I'm ready to say this in any Court. Ok. So, if they question you about who did it? My life and the children's will be ruined. Please don't expose him. I think of you as my brother. Please don't. Please help me. Did you visit Kondaraas on the day of the incident? You can tell the truth. No, Sir. I was with Kothaala Thevar in his house. He is lying. That's a lie. [Virumaandi] They killed those people. Whereas, I killed the truth. The lies I told buried the truth. The burden of other's sins was mine to bear. You are doing wrong. That day, inside the well, you were a good man. Why are you lying now? I shouldn't have spared you then. In the case filed by Nallamma Nayakar, the accused arrested under Section 302... Virumaandi Thevar, Kothaala Thevar, Kottaichaamy and others... are acquitted in this case because of insufficient evidence. Further, the Court orders the police to conduct an investigation and find the criminals. Virumaandi... Remember this... Don't think the lies have won. The truth will only prevail in the end. I can have a peaceful sleep until then. Can you? Your conscience is the Court. The rest don't matter. Start the car. My well is polluted with sewage now. I've allowed sewage into my grandmother's well. I have to find salvation. Shall I give away all my property to the village? Don't do that. I have to. I'll speak to Nallamma Nayakar's lawyer about it and give it all away. What about you then? I have money in the bank. Money will depreciate. Land will always appreciate in value. Don't be foolish and give away your land. I still have an asset of great value. What? No. We don't need them. Go away. Run away as far as you can. All alone? You said you'll be everything to me. Was that a lie? Take me with you. Sure! In a few days, I'll tell Kothaala Thevar... No. No one has to know. Let's leave today. Right now. I'm advising you like how your mother would. Take care of your children, Oh, God! I haven't bought anything for the ritual. Tie it. Bless your children with a long and happy married life. Take care of them. How about an offering for me? I'm in a hurry now. I have money in the bank... You always give some excuse or other. I do trust you. People usually give something as a token of gratitude. Something small... Please accept this. God bless you with a long and happy married life, my princess. When you told me you were bringing your wife I thought it was a bluff. Not a bad choice. She looks nice. You are lucky to marry him. He is one of a kind. Wish I had a son like him. But God bestowed me with a donkey. My fate! How long are you staying? Two to three days at the most. Why? Stay here the whole year. This is his house. Did you know? Why didn't you tell her? -I'll tell her. -I doubt that. Can I have the key? Beedi and a matchbox please. Pay here. I have to say something. He took the blame and was punished for my son's wrongdoing in Singapore... quit the job and is here now. Try to forget it. -Yes. I have... My son married a Chinese girl. He doesn't visit me or keeps in touch anymore. I've given up on my son. So, after I die, he is entitled to all my property and wealth. I'll get it after a 100 years then. Wait. I'm going for a late night movie. You both can have the house to yourselves. Hello, brother. When did you come? Virumaandi is just married. He's here for the honeymoon. I'm going for a late night movie. Why are you looking sad? Do you regret marrying a loser like me? My husband is perfect. I have no regrets. I've made up my mind. What? I don't want the name Tendulkar. Your father's name sounds fine... For our child... You are butting like a bull. From one of the fights? I got butted by a bull. It happens while taming a bull. -How? I'll tell you. While taming the bull... This is how... What? I have a scar for every bull I've tamed. I've won over the Untouchable One and I haven't got a scar. How can that be? Give me your hand. What are you doing? A mark... My lifeline... I'll bring the ointment... Shall I apply the ointment? Shall I apply the sacred ash? How can I when you hold me? Let go... Let go please. What did you ask? A 100 years with you. Will that do? Can I have coffee? You open the shop early in the morning? What are you doing here? I thought you were asleep. So, I came here to have coffee. Brother, black coffee or with milk? -Black coffee. I thought you both were sleeping. So, I opened the shop. Two people from the bank named Kottaichaamy and Raasukaalai were here asking for you. I told them you were sleeping. Did they come and meet you? Where are you going? Come inside. Madam, finish up. Pack up immediately. What happened? -We are expecting disturbance. Pack up. Take him to the main gate office and handcuff him. I'm bringing the visitors through the main gate. Lock the gates behind me. Hurry up. Paykkaaman sir, that was a sudden raid. You threatened our livelihood... so that you can enjoy the perks yourself. That's not fair. What? Madam, please... Take them... How can you talk like that in front of visitors? You don't understand a thing. The jailer doesn't believe in 'Live and let live'. He organised the raid. I have nothing to do with it. If he checks, we will incur a loss of 30 lakh rupees. What should we tell those outside? My family is out there. There is a raid in the kitchen. If someone snitches, we are in trouble. I have two more years of jail term. If something happens, then... Get lost. A business will have its ups and downs. Just think of it as a bad day at work. It's your day that is bad. You lived off the work we did. The value of our stock is 30 lakh rupees. If someone gets to know about that a riot will break out. Carry on. Start a riot. An enquiry will happen only if a complaint is written by the jailer. If a policeman writes the FIR that's it. We are done. As if he killed 24 people. I wrote the FIR and got him a death penalty. If the jailer walks out of here, you'll face the same consequence. Don't allow him to come out. What if the jailer dies in the riots caused by the convicts. Go and start a riot. Call them back here. Do you have a cell phone? -No. I'll send one across. A few of yours and a few of mine have to die so they don't suspect anything. Understand? Turn off the camera. How could you allow him to record? Close the gate immediately. Sir, the lady and the cameraman are running towards Block C. Handcuff and put them in the cell. Stop them both. What's the commotion? Who is at the gate? Stop. I warn you. Paykkaaman sir, I found the jailer in the kitchen. He is injured. Everyone is rioting here. Nothing should happen to the jailer. I warn you. Is he there? Yes. But, he cannot talk now. It looks like a knife wound. He is bleeding. I doubt he will survive. Come to Block C immediately. There's an important work for you. Bring the radio. Come here. Sir, the convicts are rioting. Catch them both and bring them here. It's not safe to go inside. I can't, Sir. I have a family dependant on me. It's right here and you raised such a fuss. Throw it over the compound wall. Tell our person to collect it later. Don't you dare say a word about this to anyone. I'll kill you. There's one more thing you have to do. The jailer's body... Move. What should we do now? He has a gun. Send all of them out. Let's lock him here and leave. Leave. Hurry up. If you find them and bring them here... What will I get? What do you want? Annalachumi. Virumaandi and I got married. I'm not part of this family anymore. I'm not part of this family anymore. I beg you. I don't want your property. I promise not to come back here ever. I'm married now. Please let me go. If I let you go, you'll file a case asking for property. I won't. I swear on my wedding talisman I won't ask. Please let me go. I want to go back to my husband. If he comes to know he will kill you. Sit down. Don't use your wedding talisman to threaten me. It can be removed and tied again. Tie it. -No. I won't. You tie it. Stop it. She might die. What's happening, Kothaala? If she is dead bury her. Open the door, Kothaala. If she lives, she will live as your wife. Let's go. What happened? Why are you coming? Stay back. You are the husband. What happened? She is crying and is in a rage. Poor thing. Let her go. Shut your mouth. Spend time with your wife. It's your 'First Night'. But it's still day. It's Ok. A Guard on night watch has no 'First Night'. Sir... What happened? She locked herself in the kitchen. Open the door. Don't do it. Annalachumi. Don't ask for the impossible. Money? Can you save me from the death penalty? Spare me. I refused to tie the wedding talisman. You'll become accomplices. Leave now. Spare me. I didn't do anything. Kottaichaamy was the one who tied the wedding talisman. Where is Kothaalan? -In his house. Really? -Yes. Show me the way. Open the door. Who is it? Kodangi. Are you not well? -Open the door. Virumaandi is here. Virumaandi is here. Who is it? What's the noise? Please spare him, brother. Don't come any closer. I'll drop him down. He'll die. Please help me. Please don't drop him down. Please don't. Kill my father. Don't spare my father. Kill him. Don't run, Virumaandi. Chase him down. Hurry up. What happened? Virumaandi stabbed him. -Is he alive? Break open the door. Take him to the hospital. The door is bolted from inside. -Move. Virumaandi, I know you are hiding in there. Better come out. Step outside. Someone control the bull. He's escaping. Catch him. He ran away. The electricity has gone. There is no way you can escape into the forest. Turn off the light. The police and the entire village is heading this way. Get into the car. Why? The enemy's enemy is a friend. Hurry up. We don't have time now. Hurry up. I'll join you in a little time. Eat and then leave. Take this cell phone with you. Eat first. Don't stay in one place. Spend your nights travelling in a bus. Don't come out in the daylight. I'll ask the lawyer about when you have to surrender. Serve him some more. - I will. Inspector Paykkaaman is here. How dare he come here? Who is it? Nothing. You eat. Please eat. God is on our side. God will never forsake the good. Get up. You have to leave now. We have no time. The police are here. Peddaraas, we have to help him escape. Sir, Inspector Paykkaaman wants to search the house. I asked him for the search warrant. -He doesn't have one. I said it's an emergency situation. He is a murderer. He's killed six people. I trust you won't give refuge to a criminal. In that case, why are you looking for him here? We were changing. How can you walk in? I apologise. -You loiter in like a stray dog. I'll wait outside. -Do that first. I'll come back soon. Bless you. I apologise. I am just doing my duty. Stop that van. Whose is that? Give way. Step aside. Why did you stop? How are you? I'm Ok. I'm not sure who to trust. Don't worry. I've spoken to the lawyer. I'll tell you when you have to go to Madurai. Let's sort out our differences later. I want Virumaandi now. Else, we will end up fighting. Don't expect any respect for your age. What do you say? What do you expect me to say? That I'm shivering in fright? This way. This is Virumaandi. The call got disconnected, Virumaandi. I'm on my way to see you. I'm in Chennai now. You wait there. I'm close by. Take the cell phone. Hurry up. Nobody touched anything? Leave. Hurry up. Leave. Take it. Leave. Yes. It's me. What? When? Shall I come? Ok. You come here. I'll wait. They just found the body. Stop whining. Take him to the hospital. Tell them you hurt your hand while fidgeting with the motor. Don't tell them about the gun. Surrender in the Madurai Court. What? It's true a policeman can't be trusted. You took money to help us. Now you tell us to surrender. I'm trying to help you. Before Virumaandi can give testimony... Sir, explain it to him. Your testimony should be the first one on record. Only then it's First Information Report. Nallamma Nayakar's men are coming. Move. Give way. What are you looking at? Move. This is Nayakar's cell phone. It has Virumaandi's number. Find him before you surrender. I understand. Don't be foolish to cut his head and throw it in the canal. I'm saying this for your own good. Dig a deep pit. Fill up with salt... Don't underestimate a sniffer dog... He's tried to call someone. Must be you. But, he had a cell phone... Didn't he? I suspect Virumaandi. He is a treacherous fellow. You shouldn't have helped him. Are you also suspecting Virumaandi? I have to write the FIR. We have to find out who killed your father. I'm sure you know Virumaandi's whereabouts. I may not be as big a lawyer as you. But, I'm a lawyer too. But, an honest one. My father said that's what I should be. Ok. Carry on. I know who killed my father. -Who? You know it too. My father believed that only truth would prevail. I believe the same. Not a single person from this village will testify against Virumaandi. Everyone already knows about our discussion. I'm talking in private out of respect. All of us are ready to attack the police, burn down the police station and go to jail. My father's funeral should take place in a dignified manner. That's why we don't want any trouble. Understood? I've spoken to him. Move. Don't cause any trouble. It will become a Law and Order situation then. Understood? Has the PP come? Don't look at them. Keep walking. That's the lawyer's car. Why did you stop the car, idiot? Hello, Sir. You shouldn't be representing a fellow like that. I'm not here as a lawyer. I haven't even shaved. Look at the stubble. Have you seen me in Court like this? Hello, Madam. I'm your old client. He was my client. He escaped twice from a murder charge. Enough. I have to meet the Magistrate. Will you give way please? Of course, Sir. Give way. He won't be able to step into Court alive. That's for sure. We will kill him today. This is inappropriate. Hurry up. Driving at snail's pace! Is the tea ready? I'm grateful to you, Madam. Catch him. No one has given a testimony against Virumaandi in Nallamma Nayakar's murder case. That doesn't matter, Your Honour. By investigating Annalachumi's murder... I can prove Virumaandi's part in the other murders that were committed. Repeat after me. -Ok, Sir. I solemnly affirm... Louder. I solemnly affirm... I state the truth. the whole truth and nothing but the truth. Quiet. Lord Muruga... When you last saw Annalachumi, was she alive? Yes, sir. Is there a witness? He won't do any wrong, Sir. Those fellows said they were from the bank. So, I showed them the house. I didn't know they had come to abduct Annalachumi. You killed your accomplices so that they would not turn witnesses. We have your fingerprints and your accomplice's from the incident spot. We have evidence that you raped Annalachumi. What is that? -Forensic report, Your Honour. The post mortem report states that you forced her against her will. Do you understand? The forensic report says it's a rape. Rape? Are you denying it? We are not denying anything. We did abduct her. But, we did because we feared Virumaandi's wrath. I swear. Your men abducted that girl and brought her as an offering to you. The poor girl fought hard. She used her nails to scratch you. Particles of your skin were found under her nails. And there is a scratch on your chest. Right? He raped and then killed the girl so there won't be a witness. And you say that she committed suicide. Am I right? The forensic report says you've had sex with her. But you deny rape. Can you explain? Why would I rape her? She was my wife. Where did you both get married? I was the one who got his parents married. I was the one who named him. If he had told me I would have got them married. But, he didn't. So you didn't get them married in the temple. Definitely not. Why would I lie about it? Ok. You can leave. So, your marriage did not take place in the temple. Do you have any record of the marriage registration? No, Sir. I don't know those formalities. I thought making a vow in front of God would do. But, you knew the formality of writing a deed giving away your land to the village. Your pretence of being a good person won't help you get away with murder. Sir, he didn't do any wrong. All this is fabricated. You will rot in hell. This is Kothaala Thevan's work. Question him. Your Honour, Kothaala Thevar has turned approver and confessed to his crimes. I respectfully request the Court to show him some mercy. Kothaala Thevar had a part in the murder of Kondaraas and others. But, it was Virumaandi who instigated it. I pray the Court awards the highest form of punishment to him. In this case with regard to the killing of 24 persons in Theni District... Virumaandi's accomplice, the second accused, Kothu alias Kothaala Thevar... as per Section 302 of IPC is awarded the life sentence. As per Section 302 of IPC, the first accused, Viruman alias Virumaandi... is being sentenced to death by hanging. This Court further as per Section 376 of IPC awards the first accused life sentence and... as per Section 148 awards three years of rigorous imprisonment. After due consideration of all the evidences and materials relevant to the case, I write this judgment. Can you save me from the death sentence? What can you give me? Mind your words. Listen to me. I can arrange for whatever will make you happy. Seeing you die in the riot will make me happy. Kothaalan? What about him? I'll offer him to you. Get me that woman and the tape. I'll give you Kothaalan. You can do what you want while rioting. How will you hand over? You find her and the tape first. I'll bring him to you. The sub jailer wants to have a word with you. What will I get? Ok. I can do it. You want the woman and that camera? Virumaandi is mine. Where are they? Give it. What are you doing? Hurry up. Hit him. Hit him again. Hit him again. Enough. Let's go. Sir, where are you going? To meet the sub jailer. I have to hand you over to Paykkaaman. Run. Where's the camera? Don't come any closer. I'll kill her. I warn you. I'll kill her. Go ahead. Leave him. Get hold of her. We were waiting for you, Sir. An enquiry will happen only if a complaint is written by the jailer. If a policeman writes the FIR that's it. We are done. As if he killed 24 people. I wrote the FIR and got him a death penalty. If the jailer walks out of here, you'll face the same consequence. Don't allow him to come out. This tape is important evidence. I trust you more than I trust Paykkaaman. We have to help her take the tape outside. Shooting order has been given. Don't go out like this. They will shoot you down. Wear the uniform of one of our injured officers. It's of on use to them now. We have to break open the door. Lift him up. Let's carry him and leave. I'm dead weight. Don't bother. All that matters is my honour. Do you understand? Yes, Sir. Our officers should not be harmed. If they are in danger, shoot at sight. What is happening? Everyone is rioting. They escaped. Don't be afraid. If you are in danger, he will know what to do. I trust you. Take this. Take this. I don't know how to use this. Better not to. It's better you don't know to use it. We are not able to break the lock. That won't work. Come here. Lift this. Bring them safe. Is there a way out? Yes, Sir. There is an exit that way. Hurry up. Don't... 'An eye for an eye' can't be the punishment. Don't kill him. [Virumaandi] People believe the prison is a place of rehabilitation and reformation. But, I have something to say. During my time in there I neither saw nor experienced anything of that sort. It's also been telecast now. An enquiry will happen only if a complaint is written by the jailer. If a policeman writes the FIR that's it. We are done. As if he killed 24 people. I wrote the FIR and got him a death penalty. After receiving special permission we have with us a guest from the prison. He was charged with many murders that he didn't commit. He was sentenced to death by hanging. Mr. Virumaandi, you are a death row convict. Do you have anything to say? Madam has appealed on my behalf to the President of India. If I get acquitted I'll be thankful and live a good man my whole life. But, would I lead a happy life...? I won't, Sir. Without Annalachumi, l just have to pull through life. But if people think I don't deserve a second chance... I'm Ok with that too. I'll think I'm going to the same place as Annalachumi in the same manner she left. Annalachumi often used to say... A person who can forgive is a man. But the person who asks for forgiveness is a respectable man. The one who asks for forgiveness is... -A respectable man. I'm trying to become a respectable man. Instead of waiting with the hope of Law being merciful and generous... I think people like Dr Angela who are fighting for reformation are doing the right thing in my opinion. Do you think crime will increase in society if death penalty is abolished? There are no facts to support that. Almost 85 countries in the world have abolished death penalty. India is the birth place of 'Ahimsa'. But we haven't taken a stand on this yet. In my opinion, when we plan to take away a life, it is murder.
