No. I'm not on drugs. And no, I'm not crazy. Hey, Anna.Have you seen David? No, I thought he'dbe with you... Is something wrong? Maybe he's stillin the lunch line? Jake, what are youdoing here?

You haven't saida word since I got here. That box that Jake hadwith him today. When I opened it, I got a weird feelingall over me. What kindof weird feeling? I had a visionof a boy - behind a rock, crying.- Oh, yeah. My mom gets those,only she calls themhot flashes. Dude, listen to what I'm saying. ( Video game beeps ) Not like that. I had a peaceful feelingall over me. I felt good. I thinki'm just gonnahave to stay away from that guy. What are your plansfor today, Jake? Anything special? Nothing really. Gonna meet upwith David and we're gonnago to the mall later and shoot some hoops.They're having an open gymlater. I think they're recruitingplayers for the team, but me and davidare just gonna shootsome hoops. Oh, I have a friendcoming over tonight. Oh, anyone I know?

Jake, did younotice the tree? Hey, buddy, wanna playsome one-on-one? - Gym's open till 7.- Let's go. By the way, no cryingwhen you lose, punk. Shut upand play, snitch. Hey, Anna's comingover later tonight. Oh, so you didcall her. - Are you gonnashow her the box?- Aw, shoot. I was gonna bring itso you could see itone more time. You just don't stop,do ya? Look Jake,i can't seewhat you see or feelwhat you feel. Maybe Anna will. What if Anna does feelwhat Richie and I feel? Why can't you? I don't know, buddy. I don't knowwhy I can't see it,or why I can't feel it. Maybe I'm notsupposed to. I don't know. It's just keepingme up at night. I don't knowwhat to do with it. All right, well tell mehow it goes, all right? - You aren't coming?- No, three's a crowd. And besides,you have to showher the box. Maybe she can help you. She goes to church. You said you seejesus, right? Maybe he's tryingto tell you something. Maybe he wants youto go back to church again,jake. Yeah. Whatever. * heedless of the windand weather * * fa la la la la * * la la la la * ( carolers chattering ) The same jesusthat was in the box. - What box?- I'm sorry, what? You said that'sthe Jesus in the box. What box? Oh. never mind. I was just talkingto myself. - Can I haveone of those posters?- Here. Thank you. Hey... Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. ( Taps ) Jake: mom, come up here, please. - Mother: what is it Jake? - Just come up here, please okay, what is it,jake? Look. I found outwhat's in here, look. What is that? It looks likea nail of some kind. This is who I see. Do you thinkit could be oneof those nails? You sure this iswho you see, Jake? I thought you saidyou saw a little boyholding the box. I do seea little boy. I see a little boyholding the box, and I see the same boy,except a little older,crying behind a rock. And then I see jesushanging on the cross. - Do you believe me?- ( Door bell chimes ) Hi, Mrs. Casper,is Jake home? Let me takeyour coat. Thank you. Jake, Anna's here. Hi. Mother: Jake, what kind of pizza do you want me to order? Pepperoni is fine. - Is that okay with you?- Sure, that's fine. Awesome.there's somethingi want to show you. Sit down. So how did you feelwhen you opened it? I didn't feelanything. Okay, look. There's somethingin here.( Knocks ) What is it? Some kind of nail. Jake, where didyou get this? I found itin my grandpa's store. He dieda few weeks ago. So you don'tfeel anythingwhen you hold the nail? No.what do you mean,jake? Believe it or not, when I open the box,i see a vision of a little boyholding it. I think I even seejesus hung on the cross. When I hold the nail I see a visionof the same boy, except a little bit older,holding the same box. It's like... It's like it'sin a different placein time. Are you sure? I didn'tfeel anything? - Have you had your momor anybody else open the box?- Yeah, but... - The only person that feltanything was Richie.- Richie? It's a long storyabout Richie. That... Is who I see on the cross. Do you see the nailthrough his hand? Could that nail bethe one that hung jesuson the cross? I don't know. Is that even possible? I've never heardof anyone findingthe nails that crucified Jesus. I mean, I've heardabout the shroud, but that's about it. I heard about it. People still sayit's fake though. I have a Bible in my roomthat my grandpa left me. I think it has picturesof the crucifixion tell meabout this little boyyou see. I told you,i see a visionof a little boy playing with the box.And then the same boy,and the same box, except a little older. Crying behind a rock. Maybe the boy put the nailin the box, maybe he saw jesusbeing crucified. I'll be right back. ( Door bell chimes ) Pizza's here. - Hi.- your pizza. Yes, how much? - 144.95.- um, no there-- - 133.95.- there must be a mistake... - 122.67.- it's supposedto be closer to 20 some... There's nomistake here, missy. Hey frank,i got one giving usa hard time-- ( laughs )there's no frankover there. It's just me. Okay, how muchdo I owe you? Seven bucks. I have 30. Keep the change. - Thank you.- Merry Christmas. Jake: mom! - Check this out.- What? The Bible? No, I found a noteinside of it. July 14, 1998. Today I'm writingthis to let whomeverfinds this letter know that it'sin my possession. I have a small wooden box that is filled with some sort of something that is beyond my comprehension. You see the boxcontains nothing. Yet it feels likesomething is in it. When I open the box, I immediately get a very peaceful and beautiful feeling. You might thinki'm crazy, but this box is connectedto someone called holy. It's a feeling that I can't describe. When I open the box,i see Jesus hangingon the cross. I can see a young man holding this very box and crying. While he's watching Jesus being crucified. I can't help but thinkof my Jake when I getthis feeling. I'm not sure, but I believe this box is meant to be in Jake's possession. Carry out something that only he is meant to. I know that jakewill find this box, just at the timehe needs it to fulfill whateverhe has been calledto do. Jake, what do youthink this means? Grandpa felt and sawwhat I feel and see. What if grandpawas right? What if i'msupposed to do somethingwith the box? But what? He never saidwhere he found it. What if someonegave it to him? What if grandpa foundthe box where I found it? What if he left it thereso I would find it? Someone called holy. What does thateven mean? Okay, there isan explanationfor all of this. There has to be. You told methat grandpa always talked about peoplethat came into his shop. Do you rememberanything about somebody that gave himthe box. No. I don't rememberhim saying anything about anyonegiving him the box. Maybe somebodysold it to him. ( Sighs )i don't know,maybe he did-- I just don't understandhow I only know three people that felt what I feltwhen I opened the box. Why didn't you, Anna,or David feel anything? Why just me, grandpa,and Richie? How do you know richiefeels what you feel,jake? Does he knowabout the box? He opened it. He didn't sayanything, but... I know he felt it. That's whati don't understand, Richie is nota nice guy. Wait, is thatthe same Richie that cameto your birthday partywhen you were 10 and poppedall of the balloons?That Richie? - Wasn't he sickor something?- Yeah, that's him. - ( Door bell chimes )- ( knocking ) Looks like it's timefor me to go. I'll get it. Look, don't tell my momthat Richie bullies me. She'll freak. I'm Anna's sister,here to pick her up. Anna! - Call me tomorrow, okay?- Anna. - Ready to go home, punk?- I'm so sorry, I thoughtmy mom was picking me up. - What does that mean?- Is this your sister? - You can pick me upif you want me to.- Yeah. Jess, we gotta go. Open the door. You don't want meto come in, do you? Oh is that him?Even you can do betterthan that. He's not my boyfriend. Right! later, boyfriend. Anna: why do you always do this to me? Maybe you shouldtalk to pastor mikeabout all of this. Look, mom. I don't knowwhat to make of anyof this either, but you know the last timei went to church was for grandpa'sfuneral. I just don't wantto go back to the place I had to say goodbyeto him, you know? If you think you needto talk to pastor Mike,i can invite him over here. I'm gonna go to bed. - Let me thinkabout it.- Okay. Good night, honey. Jake: good morning, mom. - Good morning.- Did you get any sleep? Uh no, not really.How about you? Not really. I opened the box,though. There's somethingso powerful about it. It doesn'tscare me, though. Like I said,maybe you should talkto pastor Mike about that. He can at leastgive you his opinion about what you see and feelwhen you open the box. Hey. I never thoughtabout this, but this looksjust like Mrs. rousso. What? Doesn't that lookjust like Mrs. rousso? ( Laughs ) Right? Yeah, like a youngmrs. Rousso. - That's it, mom.- What's it? Mrs. rousso. Do you think she knowsanything about the box? You said that herand grandpa werebest friends. Didn't they get coffeelike every day? Maybe she just nevertold us about the box Let's go. Uh, give me a secondto get ready, will ya? ( Sighs ) Richie, you better tellthe doctor everything, because if you don't,i will. Okay, I told you,i'm gonna tell themeverything. The doctor willbe right in. Mrs. leal. - It's nice to see you.- Nice to see you, doctor. There's Richie.How ya doing? Looks like you'velost some weight, how long haveyou had this cough? I guess, I've had itfor a few days now-- he's had the coughfor a week. - And he won't eat.- Ma, please! Why aren'tyou eating, Richie?What's up with that? I'm just not hungrythese days. Connie, would youplease excuse us? I need to takea good look at Richie. Make yourself at homein the waiting area. I'll come and get youwhen we're done. Look, Richie.It looks like I'm gonnahave to admit you. I'm not takingany chances. Come on, doc.It's Christmas time. I know.You wanna be homefor Christmas. I get it. But lookat the weather out here. People are runningaround with coldand flu bugs. Stuff like thatcould kill you. And you know it. I'll go outand I'll talk to mom, and I'll let her knowwhat's going on. We'll getthe paperwork started. Hang in there. - Need help with that, ma?- Oh, no thanks, - I'm almost done.- All right. Where's your coat? This is my coat. ( Laughs )all right look, I'm gonna go meetthe guys at the arcade. Those video gamesare a waste of time. Would it kill youto read a book every once in a while? It might. I don't wantto take the chance.( Laughs ) Richie, I knew it. You're not well. Ma, it's okay.I'll be in the hospitalfor just a few days. I'll be outby Christmas time. ( Coughs ) You know, christmaswon't mean anything to mewithout you. I just want youto be healthy. ( Door opens ) Richie,this is some paperworkthat you and your mom need to takeover to the first floor. From there,they will take youto your room. You know the routine. I'm sorryyou have to be here. I hate this. Mrs. rousso: What's this Jake tells me? You havesome questions? Well, I thinkjake is the onewith the questions. Huh.well, I knowthis box. Your grandfathershowed it to me before. Did he giveit to you? No. no, he didn'texactly give it to me. Open it. I want youto open it. Do you feelor see anythingwhen you open it? Have you calledyour father? His shift is almost donefor the day? Yes, I called paco, too. ( Coughs ) Why don't yougo home, mom? I'll wait for dad. I'll waitfor him, too. I'll go home later, I wanna talkto the doctor. Is this room coldor is it just me? Congratulations,mr. and Mrs. leal. Say hi,to your new mommyand daddy, Richie. Hello,mommy and daddy. ( Laughing ) - He's beautiful.- He's perfect. Welcome home, Richie. Lord, please takecare of my son. ( Sighs ) Jake, you felt whatyour grandfather felt when he openedthis box. You know,he even said, "i have no ideawhat heaven is like, but if it feelslike it does when I openthe box, then I can't waitto get there." When he used to say,"i get a special feeling." I thought he was losinghis mind or something. I mean, no offense,maggie, but... None taken. - Man, it's cold out there.- Yeah, I know. Have you heardabout Richie? No, what about him? He's in the hospital. He's sick again. What do you mean,sick again? Cancer's back. He's not doingtoo good. I mean... I meanit doesn't look good,you know? I have a bad feelingabout this. Hey, you wantto go see him, man? No. They won't let us in. Besides, Richie said it'stoo far for us to go. Fine. Now, let's go playthat boxing gameover there. The box. What box? The box that Jake had. That Richie picked upoff the ground. Remember whenthey fought at the schoolthe other day. Yeah, what about it? Well, that night,richie told me something. It was reallybothering him. He said thatwhen he opened the box, something cameover him. Something...peaceful. That's crazy, man. I don't knowwhat that means, but somethingtells me that we needto go find Jake. Well do you knowwhere to find him? No. there's waysto find him. Let's go. Man, I still don't knowwhat that little boxcan do for Richie. Did he ever mentionwhat was in the box? He always saidhe felt like the box held somethingspecial inside. Although, he nevercould find it. And you know, the box, the box hadsome weight to it. I bet you twodon't know this. Your grandfathertook care of a homeless manfor a while. He'd come in hereand he'd get his meals. And your grandfatherwould pay for it. He even let him stayin the back of his storefor a few weeks. I bet you didn'tknow that, Maggie. Nope. Anyway, the first timei saw that box, was shortly afterholy disappeared. So I alwaysjust believed, holy gave himthe box. He never mentionedanything like thatto me. Although, I guessit's because I probablywould have told dad to makethe homeless manleave the shop. Huh. well, I'll be. He was right. There is somethingin there. What is it? I don't know. I think it'ssome kind of nail. May I? You know,just a few months before your grandpapassed. He told me he wasgoing to hide the boxin the store. ( Chuckles )and that if youhad anything to do with it, Jake, you would findthe box. And he believed somehowthe box would end upin your hands. At justthe right time. You mentioned, holy. Was that the homelessguy's name? He saidhe was knownas holy. Holy...like god holy, or holey likeholey clothes. When your grandfathertold me he was gonna let this guystay in his shop, I did my research.I went around and I askeda lot of questions. And everyone I askedsaid he was harmless. Just a kind old man. Hey mom, do youknow how Jesus was nailedto the cross? Well, he diedso that you and icould have life. Yeah, I know that,but were the nails through his handsor his wrists. I'm not sure. I see some pictureswith the nails through his hands,and some pictures with the nailsthrough his wrists. I can't reallytell you any morethan I already know. Do you knowwhere holy is now? You know,i can't say, Jake. After he leftyour grandpa's shop, nobody ever sawhim again. I mean... Seems likehe just disappeared. I asked about himfor a while, but nobody'sever seen him again. He truly wasa kind old man that never didany harm to anyone. And you knowanother thing, he used to hand outthese little woodencrosses, I don't even knowwhere he got them. I we needto get going.I have to stop by the churchand drop offsome boxes. - Okay.- thank you, so muchfor all of your time. - Oh thank you, Maggie.- Bye. We'll see youlater. You guystake care now. His "sats"are really low,mrs. Leal. The doctor willbe in soon. ( Kisses ) ( Knocks ) Hi. I gotthe test results back. It's not good. Looks likethe cancer is back. I'm sorry.It's... it's bad. Please, tell me we canbeat the cancer again. We did it before,doctor. I'll run more testsin the morning. But just so we're clearand all on the same page,he's a sick young man. Hi, dad. How was work today? It was okay, son. How are you doing? I'm not feelingtoo well right now. What does the doctor say? It's back, right? He's gonna runsome more testsin the morning. Are you hungry,richie? I can ask the nurseto get you something-- mom, I'm not hungry. I feel really tired. Besides,the food hereis awful. Okay,you get some sleep. I'll be herewhen you get up. I want to go home, mom. Please, Connie,go home and getsome rest. I'll staywith him tonight. I'm not going,richard. I'm scared. I'm really scaredthis time. You go home,you must be tired after workingfor 12 hours. If you're gonna go home,you should takeyour jacket. I'm not going home. I'm gonna go tothe chapel and pray. ( Crying ) ( Cell phone rings ) - Hey, Cindy.- Hi, Anna, you busy? No, I'm justreading a book. - What are you doing?- Nothing. Listen, have you heardanything about Richie? No, I haven't heardanything about Richie. He's in the hospital. Is he goingto be okay? Do you knowwhere Jake lives? I knowwhere he lives, but he and his momare out shopping today. Yeah, I'll do my bestto get a hold of him. - And I'll call youright back.- Okay. Thanks. - Hey, Anna. - Have you heardanything about Richie? No, I haven't heardanything about Richie. Well, he'sin the hospital. Apparently he'sreally sick. When did that happen? Cindy just called me. Oh, and she saidpaco's lookingfor you. Wait, why is pacolooking for me? I don't know. Look, I'm goingto the church with my mom. So I'll call youlater, okay? Okay, bye. Was that Anna? Yeah. She says that richieis in the hospital. He's really sick. Did she saywhat hospital he's at? I wonder what couldbe wrong with him. I don't know. Hey Cindy,did you find Jake? Anna said he's out running errands with his mom. - Oh, okay.- You know, holiday stuff. - Yeah. thanks.- Have you heard anything about Richie? No, I don't anythingmore about Richie. Well, tell him I said, "hi," okay? Yeah, I'll tell himyou said, "hi," the next timei talk to him. - Thank you. - Yeah, thanks. So... did shefind him? No. she talkedto Anna. Anna said Jake'sout running errandswith his mom. Probablychristmas shoppingor something. So... what now? I don't know. I guess we justwait and see. We have to getthat box to Richie. I have a feeling... - He needs it.- Alright man. Well, if you gosee him tomorrow,call me. I'll go with you. You ladies need helpwith anything? I brought the boxof decorations that we usedlast year. And Jake's hereto help if we need him. Hey, Jake.What are you doing here? What are youdoing here? Pastor Mike saidthe ladies were gonna comeand help the place up. So mom volunteered me,of course. I thought youstopped comingto church? No, Jake.You stopped. Did you hearabout Richie? No, what about him? Anna called me today,said he's really sick.He's in the hospital. No, I hadn't heard that. Well, you ladiesare doing a great jobas usual. Hope you're lettingthese boys do someof the work. - David. glad you came outto give a hand.- Thanks for having me. Jake! is that you? It's been a while.How've you been? I'm fine, pastor.I'd actually liketo talk to you about something,if you have a minute. Of course.You boys wanna talkin the office? That's great.Hey, mom. David and I are gonnatalk to the pastorin his office. Yep. i'llwait for you. Isn't thatjust like a man?They're going on break - before they even getstarted working.- Typical. Pastor Mike:What can I dofor you, Jake? By the way,i know how hard it was for you to loseyour grandfather. He did great thingsfor this church. He's missed dearly. Thanks, pastor. It just feels weirdbeing at churchwithout him, but I feel likehe's with me right now. What'son your mind, Jake? It's about this. Do you knowwhat this box is,pastor? Do you see anythingwhen you open it? Yes. And I'm almost sureyou're going to tell methat you do too. Aren't you? I do. My grandfather feltsomething too, he wrote a letterabout it in his Bible. I know he did, Jake. I told himto write it. You see, this is notthe first time that i'veseen this box. A few years ago,your grandfather came byto see me and his brought this boxwith him.

And I went downto the store and gotyou a coffee - like I did today.- You did that many times,richard. - We were herewith Richie for weeks.- I know. But the first time, do you rememberwhat happened? What happened? I was walkingto the store, and I saw an old man. He was getting beat up really bad in an alley. And I remember running towards him and the guys ran away. He was hurt really bad. I picked him up and carried him to the hospital. He was bleeding. And when they put him on to the hospital bed, a little wooden cross fell out of his pocket. And I remember him looking at me and saying he would repay me someday, for the act of kindness. Maggie: okay, I do remember that. I was mad at youfor not bringing me backa coffee. Yeah, I just rememberhow thankful he was. I wonder whateverhappened to him. Who knows. Good evening,we are here to seerichie leal, I believe he wasadmitted today.

And merry Christmas. I'd like to startby sharing somethingwith all of you that happenedjust a few days ago. These kidsare about to tell youa true story, of what Jesus christhas done for them. I know,because I was there. So, let'sget started. Jake? ( Applause ) Thanks so much,pastor Mike. ( Microphone feeds back ) Hello, everyone. My name isjake Casper. Wow, there's a lotof people here today. Well,it's been an amazing week,to say the least. If you believethat Jesus christisn't performing any miraclesthese days, and it's impossibleto love even your worstenemies, sit back, and listento our story. A true story that beginswith a small wooden box. I call itthe messenger's box. And somewhere tucked awayin the atticsof our hearts, we all havea messenger's box. But make no mistake,it's not about the boxitself. It's about what'sin the box. And if you findyourself in a hopelesssituation today, no matter what it is. No matter how darkthat situation may seem. There is hope. And that hope is in Jesus Christ. You see, we are notguaranteed tomorrow, or even the next minute. So after you hearour story, I'd like eachand every one of you, to answerthese questions. Have you foundyour messenger's box? Have you opened it? And if you haven't, what are youwaiting for? **
