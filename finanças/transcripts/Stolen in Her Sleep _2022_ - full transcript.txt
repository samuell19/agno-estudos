Hey, brought you a coffee. Cream, no... Hey, you're not supposed to be in here. [soft music] [baby monitor crackling] - James! - You're home early. Well, that client just agreed to everything that I asked him, so I got up out of there, first flight to Dallas. That's amazing. Oh, I'm so happy to see you, Hallie. I know how hard it is on you when I'm gone. Well, the important thing is that you're here now. - [baby fussing] - Oh, I just checked on Ava. She's knocked out. What were you saying? I was saying, um... [baby babbling] - Oh, baby, it's nothing. - I promise. I'm just... I'm gonna check on her. - I'll be right back. - Okay. [soft music] See? I told ya. Come on. I'll make some tea. Come on. Give me some attention. - I've been gone for too long. - [laughs] I thought you were gonna start napping when Ava took naps to catch up on some of those late nights, right? I know, I try, but every time I start to fall asleep, the monitor goes off, so I thought I'd do some work. I don't know. Even when I do sleep, I don't really seem to wake up feeling rested. You could at least turn that thing down a little bit. I mean, geez, no wonder you can't sleep. But what if Ava needs me? If Ava needs you, she's gonna let you know. There ain't nothing wrong with her lungs. Just her heart. Hey, not anymore, right? She's as healthy as any baby out there. Doctor said she's fine. I know, I know. I just... I can't help but think something, anything, everything is gonna go wrong again. That's just your anxiety talking. It's been two months since the transplant, baby. She's fine. You're still taking your meds? What kind of question is that? Well, the doctor said if you stop, it could cause headaches and paranoia. - Hallucinations, I know. - I was at the appointment, too. I would never do anything to endanger Ava. - You know that. - I know. I just also know you hate taking those pills, and... And? Nothing, nothing, baby. James? Look, I just know how stressful this is for you. I want to make sure you're okay. I'm okay. Because if you're not okay, you can tell me. I'm okay. Okay, good. Well, I, uh, think we might be able to get a little extra help. Oh, Mary already comes two times a week, and I don't really think we can afford... Not Mary. My mother suggested that she could help. Told her we'd talk about it. - So I could be the bad guy. - No. I think we should say yes. I think she could be a big help for you. - Your mother? - You sound surprised. Well, I mean, I am. I know you guys have had some good talks the past few months, but bringing her into our home to help with Ava, that's a big step. - Yeah, I know. - It's all happening so fast. This just makes sense to me. You know? I mean, ever since she got the courage to leave Joe, I know this is what she wants, a chance to get close to me again, to you, especially to Ava. Are you sure that Joe is out of the picture? This time she really left. And for the first time in a long time, I get my mom back. Ava gets to know her grandmother. - Then it's settled. - Okay, good. Because I told her to come by at 1:00. 1:00? I know it's super short notice. But she was so excited to meet you and Ava, and... Of course, of course. I just... I wish I had some more time to do something special for lunch. - I got lunch covered. - You go take a nap. - Oh, a nap would be so nice. - But are you sure? Because Ava isn't gonna sleep that much longer, and... I got it, baby. Mary's coming over to help today, too. She'll help when Ava wakes up. - Okay. - Go get some rest. - Get horizontal. - [laughs] Hallie, why don't you try sleeping without that thing? Right, force of habit. I love you. Headaches, hallucinations, and paranoia, oh my. [baby crying] Okay, I know, honey. All right, okay. So today we are meeting someone special, and it's important to your daddy that we're supportive. Okay? So we have to be really nice. [doorbell rings] Oh, that's her. Let's go meet your grandma. Oh, it is so good to see my son. - Thanks for coming over, Mom. - Looky here. - Hi. - Oh, there they are. Your beautiful girls. Mom, this is my wife, Hallie, and this is... Oh, Ava, of course. Oh, I know how to hold a baby. Yes, I do. Oh, I used to hold your daddy the exact same way. Yes, I did. I have a present for you. Mr. Fuzzleby. You remember Mr. Fuzzleby? He was your favorite stuffy for years and years. I had to put up quite a fight to keep Joe from throwing him away. Oh, yeah. Hallie? I'm just about finished with these. - Oh, thank you, Mary. - Mary, this is Lynne Reynolds, James' mother, and this is Mary Collins. She helps out a couple times a week. Nice to meet you, Mrs. Reynolds. You too, Mary. Thank you so much. There's Daddy. - Oh, let me see my girl. - Let me see my girl. Come here, sleepy girl. Oh, come on, Mom. That's not necessary. - You don't need to do that. - Oh, it's no bother. You didn't tell me that you have a maid. Oh, well, you know, Mary's more of a mother's helper. Oh, well, if you must have a stranger in the house. Okay, how about some lunch? Let's eat. [all laughing] So he stands up in front of everyone and says, "Look, Mommy, I'm big Jim." And then his pants drop. [laughs] Well, I mean, I was six years old. Those pants would have fit a 12-year-old, Mom. Oh, you exaggerate. Oh, let me help you. - Oh, no, you're our guest. - Well, I would love to help. James, remember the time I was telling one of your friends about when I first tried to potty train you? You know, I... [laughing] Oh, well. This is... here, let get that. I guess it's easy to let your housework get away from you when there's a new baby in the home. I was actually on kitchen duty today. So that's my fault. Oh, well, that's understandable then. I just thought, well, since you weren't working, that you were in charge of the house. - Actually, I do work. - I'm an artist. Oh. James told me that you weren't painting anymore. What I actually said is Hallie hasn't had a lot of time to paint these days just 'cause Ava's got a lot of doctors' appointments. But I do have a new show that... That's wonderful. It's so great to have a creative outlet. But after all, family is most important, right? I'm gonna let you two catch up. And it's about time that Ava had some fresh air anyway. That sounds lovely, dear. And we'll just tidy up in here while you're out. Thanks, and please ask James if you need to know where anything goes. - All right, let's get to it. - Let's get to it. Is that a good spot? Hi. Hi, I'll have a chamomile tea, please. Yeah, sure. Oh, I seem to have forgotten my wallet. Sorry, um... I'm sorry. I don't... - Oh, here. - I got that. Oh, you don't have to do that. - I'm happy to do it. - Thank you. I can't tell you how many times I've run out of my house without my wallet, and some good Samaritan has come to my rescue. So I guess it was my turn. I'm Megan Devereaux, by the way. - I'm Hallie Reynolds. - Nice to meet you. - And this is Ava. - Well, hello there, hey. She's so precious. Would you like to have tea with us? Ava isn't much of a conversationalist yet, but... Well, how can I say no to that smile? Oh, perfect. How old is she? - She's nine months. - Thank you. You know, I don't know why coffee shops always insist on putting pictures of steaming coffee cups everywhere. I mean, do they really think that we're gonna forget about our caffeine cravings? I'm sorry. I'm super opinionated. I'm an art PR, so... - Oh, I know what that is. - That's... I'm an artist myself. Mostly mixed media and acrylics. You're that Hallie Reynolds, the one from Albuquerque? I'm from Los Angeles now, but how do you know? One of my colleagues gave me the catalog to your last show. It was unforgettable. I had no idea anyone knew me here. I'm actually working on a few new pieces now. Well, what are they like? I'm just trying a new direction at the moment, several new directions, any direction I can think of, to be honest. Oh, you don't have to worry. I mean, your last show was such a hit. Thank you. But that show, I felt like I could just close my eyes and I know what to create. Now all I see is the inside of my eyelids. Creative block. If the creative block was the size of the Great Wall of China. I thought it would get better now that Ava's healthy, but... You know, I'd be happy to take a look at your work if you'd like. - Really? - Of course, yeah. Well, I know what all the galleries are looking for right now, so... - That'd be great. - So what was wrong with her? What's up with that creepy guy staring at us? - What? - What guy? [tense music] He must have moved on. Anyway, you were saying now that Ava's healthy... was she not? I hope it wasn't anything serious. Oh, it was her heart. But she's all better now. It has been really nice getting to know you. Thank you for the company and the tea. Yeah, anytime. And I meant what I said about coming to see your work. Why don't you just put your number into my phone, and I'll just give you a call in a few days? Thanks. It was really nice to meet you. And you too, little Ava, sweetheart. - Bye. - Bye. Thank you. [baby crying] It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. - Hey, whoa, Hallie. - What's going on? - Someone was following me. - They were at the café. And then they were running behind me just now. Are you serious? Hey, who's out there? Well, I don't see anybody. Maybe it was your mom's ex-boyfriend? - Joe? - Why would Joe be following you? I don't know... I mean, you said he was dangerous... Hey, I don't think my mother is lying to us. Well, she would do anything to be back in your life again. And now she's in our home, and... Baby, did you take your pill? - Yes. - Okay. I'm just asking. - Okay, I'll keep an eye out. - It's okay, baby. Is she okay? - Yeah, yeah, she's fine. - Here. It was just so weird. Hey. Hey, baby. Okay. You seem really freaked out right now. Yeah, I'm fine. It was probably just a jogger or something. I, uh... I wanted to get back before your mom left. Okay, well, Mom's actually gone already. - Oh. - She said she had a date. So there goes your theory. - Well, that's great. - She deserves a nice man. Look, I know you guys kind of got off to a rocky start. It's okay, I'm sure she just feels like she has a lot of lost time to make up for. Yeah, yeah, she actually said something like that. So I told her that she could come around whenever she'd like and help out. I hope that's okay. Yeah, yeah, it'd be great to get to know her better. It's important to me to have her a part of our family, you know? - Yeah, of course. - I'm sorry. No, stop. I actually just found out I have to go back to Dallas tomorrow, too. - You just got back. - I know, I'm sorry. They just called me. Apparently that deal isn't going as well as I thought. And that's why I thought you'd want the extra help. I can tell her not to come. Say the word. No, no, it'll be good to have extra help. I actually met someone at the café who's an art PR. - Really? - Yeah, I forgot my wallet. And she paid for my tea, and we got talking. And I don't know, there's something about her that makes me want to paint. Baby, that's awesome! I know you're dying to show your work off again. Now you can. It's been a rough year, but it's all gonna work out, right? Good morning, beautiful. Princess still sleeping? Yes, like the royalty she is. I didn't even hear you get up this morning. I got up early. I worked on some of the brush strokes, and... do you want some eggs? Ooh, no, I gotta go. Did you get any sleep last night? - Yeah, I got some. - Wish I didn't have to leave. Me, too. - Duty calls. - Hey, do me a favor. Please try not to jump every time Ava makes noise, okay? And try to get some sleep. Not sleeping does funny things to people. Promise. - Go get 'em, tiger. - Bye. [baby monitor crackles] [sighs] It's nothing. Concentrate. [baby crying] Okay, just a quick look. What? Ava? - No, no, no, no, no. - 911, what's your emergency? - My baby. - Someone took my baby. - Ma'am? - Hallie. What's the matter? Ma'am, ma'am, are you there? - No... no emergency. - Thank you. Were you just calling 911? I went into her room, and she wasn't there. Well, I went to check on her, and she was already awake. So I thought I'd give her a bottle. She's just getting settled down. What are you doing here? James gave me a key so I wouldn't disturb your work. - Oh, how thoughtful of him. - Don't you have work to do? No, we usually do story time now, so I can... Oh, well, Grandma and Ava can do story time. That'll be fun. You can get back to painting. Looks like you had your work cut out for you from the last I saw. You were in my studio? Oh, James just gave me a tour. It is so lovely. It'll be a perfect playroom for Ava when she gets a little older. Uh-huh. James told me about your new boyfriend. Oh, he did? He seems nice. I'm sure Joe is upset. Joe? It is done with Joe, and he knows it. Are you sure? 'Cause guys like that usually don't take well to rejection. I'm sure. Well, I'd love to meet your new boyfriend, hear more about him. I don't think it's necessary. It's very new, and there's not much to tell. Oh, are you sure about story time? Oh, of course. Okay. [phone rings] - Hello? - Hallie? This is Megan Devereaux from the café. Megan, hi. I was just telling my husband how much I enjoyed meeting you. - Oh, how sweet. - How are you? And how's little Ava? - We're doing fine. - Great. My offer still stands to take a look at your work. That would be amazing. And I'd love to make you lunch as a thank you. How's Wednesday 1:00? - Perfect. - Just text me your address, and I'll see you both then. Okay, bye. Okay. [soft music] [indistinct chatter] Mary, hi. - Hi, Hallie. - How's our little angel today? - She's good, thank you. - She's just finishing up a nap. Would you be able to get her ready for the park? - Of course. - Thank you. Hi. - Lynne! - I wasn't expecting you today. Well, I just thought I would pop in and see if there's anything you needed. - Oh, that's so sweet. - But we're good. Well, I'm sure I could find something. There's always so much to do when there's a baby in the house. It's just that I have a meeting today with an art PR specialist, and she's coming to look at some of my work. Oh, that's nice. I could take Ava for a walk while you talk to your specialist. - Mary has that sorted. - But I was really hoping... Look, I'm really sorry that you drove all the way here. It's just that I would have let you know if I knew you were coming. Oh, I didn't know I needed an invitation. Of course, you don't. It's just James and I really want to respect your time. How about we lock something in concrete then? Ava's story time tomorrow. She would really like that. All right. You let me know if you need anything in the meantime. I'll be sure to let you know. - Okay. - Okay, bye. [sighs] - Hey! - Hi, how's the baby? Sorry, what? Hold on, I can't hear you. How you doing? Good? How's the little one? - Oh, she has the sniffles. - Oh, my goodness. Do you want to go to the coffee shop later? - Hold on. - Let me check my calendar. - Yeah. - Around what time? How 'bout about 4:00? Yeah, works for me. - Okay, I'll see you then. - Bye. Okay, bye. Here's my girl. [doorbell rings] - Megan, hi. - Please come in. - These are for you. - Oh, thank you. - And this is... - Where's little Ava? Oh, we can give it to her when she gets back. Oh, she's not here now? I sent her for a walk with the mother's helper. It's less interruptions that way. She'll be back in an hour or so. - Great. - So what's first, food or art? - Oh, do you even have to ask? - Art. The light in this room is great! Yeah, it's part of the reason we got the place. I knew it would be a perfect studio. Oh, those... I mean, you don't have to... they're not really finished. Oh. This is interesting. Why did you stop working on it? I just can't seem to finish that one. Oh, you should. It's just... it's got so much life to it. It's like you can almost see her breathing. I have some other sketches. - I could show you... - Oh, huh. I'm sorry, I just wasn't expecting... This isn't like your usual work. Is the slash something you're experimenting with? Um, no, I don't know how that got there. Hey, how about I show you the house, and then we can have some lunch? Great. [tense music] Oh. What a pretty nursery. May I? Ah, it seems like Ava's already starting a little collection. That was James's favorite when he was little. Or at least, that's what his mom says. He doesn't remember it at all. Sometimes miracles are just good people with kind hearts. I feel like there's a story behind that. There is. It might just be the reason that portrait of Ava is so hard to finish. We almost lost her because of her heart. It was a congenital defect that surgery couldn't correct. Oh, how awful. But a heart transplant saved her life. So I painted this for her nursery, and I painted another for the donor's family, and I sent it to them through the hospital. That's so sweet. It doesn't begin to express my gratitude. Oh, I never asked. Do you have any children? - Me? - No, no, no, no. Art is my love. Now let's go have some lunch. And we're gonna go over all the ideas I have for your next sellout show. Okay. I guess you could call it a family business or a family calling. My mother was an art PR, and so it just felt natural for me to do it, too. And I get to work with wonderful people like yourself. Oh, thank you. [gagging, wheezing] Oh my, Mary! - Hey, hey! - Mary, what's wrong? - Mary, what happened? - Is she okay? And I know the perfect gallery for you. In fact, we should go tomorrow and meet with the owner, show her a few of your pieces. - I would love to. - You sound so surprised. I think it's what I went through with Ava. When she was born, I had all of these instincts on how to love her and how to care for her. And then when Ava got sick, I couldn't trust my instincts anymore. That must have been the worst feeling. It was, and still is in some ways. My doctor has me on these pills that help me live somewhat normally. And, even though Ava is healthy, I still don't know which instincts to trust and which are mama jitters. - Mama jitters? - It has to be that. I'm sure everything's gonna be fine. [sirens wailing] [indistinct chatter] [ominous music] [phone rings] - Oh, I might just get that. - It might be Mary. Oh, it's just James. Oh, no, go ahead. - Hey, James. - How's Dallas? Hallie, baby, there's been an accident in the park with Mary. - Okay. - It sounded really bad. You better get over there. - Yeah. - What is it? There's been an accident at the park with Mary and Ava. Okay. Are you okay? Can I... okay, I'll drive. - Okay, come on. - Let's go. Excuse me, excuse me. I'm Hallie Reynolds. Officer Davis called my husband and said... I'm Hallie Reynolds. There's been some sort of accident? What happened? Is Mary okay, and Ava? I'm very sorry, ma'am, but Ms. Collins didn't survive. - What? - She died? What happened? And where's my baby? Is Ava okay? She said she was going to take her away from the commotion. - Who? - Your mother-in-law. She said she'd look after her until you got here. Of course she did. Is there anything I can do for Mary to help? No. We were able to get in contact with the family. But I'm sure they'll be touch with you if they need anything. I'm sorry for your loss, ma'am. Thank you. It's pretty convenient that she was here to save the day. Yeah, it's a little strange, but just go easy on her. She's still Ava's grandma. Yeah, I'll be back in a sec. - Finally decide to show up? - What are you doing here? I was on the phone with James when the police called. You were still in your meeting with your artist specialist. I came soon as I got the call. That woman has died of a drug overdose. What? - But Mary wasn't an addict. - I cannot believe you would let a woman like that around your baby! I let you around her. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that. So I suppose my past with Joe makes me dangerous to your family? Joe is out of my life. I told you that. I shouldn't have said that. It was out of line, and I'm sorry. But it's been a big day. And I really should get Ava home. I want to be a family again with my son. And I am not gonna let my past get in the way of that. And I'm not asking you to. But ever since you've been at our house, someone has been watching me and following me. And if it's not Joe, then who is it? Your new boyfriend? The one you won't introduce to the family? Joe is out of my life. I promised that to James. So whoever or whatever this is, it is not him. And I will tell you something. I will never let anybody get in the way of my relationship with my son again. Anything else? No. - Oh, that woman. - Breathe, just breathe. Here you go. Okay, good night. [baby fusses] I love you. Mary on drugs? I know, I can't believe I didn't notice. I didn't either. You didn't spend as much time with her as I did. What if I missed something? Well, you have been tired all the time. Yes, I've been tired. And I know that something's off with me, but I don't know what it is. Well, the first step is to get more help. I'll call the agency first thing in the morning. Because they did such a good job last time. Okay, well, I know my mom would be happy to help out more. I don't think your mom likes me very much. What makes you say that? She's just judging me as a mother, and she wants me to stay home with Ava in the house and not have a career. Okay, well, maybe she's just thinking about everything she missed out on when I was a kid. But that still doesn't give her the right to pass judgment on our lives. - All right. - So what do you want to do? I want you come home. I want that, too. I'll try to get home as soon as I can. - I know, thank you. - I love you. - I love you, too. - Bye. Bye. Ava? Someone stole my baby! Ava? Someone stole my baby! Ma'am, ma'am! You can't block the exit with your stroller. - I... - Ma'am, are you okay? Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. You shouldn't leave your child alone. Anyone can take her. Oh, I'm so sorry, Ava. What? [thud] [baby fussing] Oh, can't get any sleep tonight? Hmm? You can't sleep either? I don't think I'm gonna sleep tonight either. Yeah? Hi, baby. Hi, hi, hi. - Hallie, Hallie, Hallie! - What? What are you doing falling asleep with Eva in your arms? Don't you know how dangerous that is? I was... You could have dropped her and not even known it. - I would never do that. - What are you doing here? You invited me over for story time. You really need to take better care of yourself, if not for you then for Ava. Now, go to bed and get a proper rest. - And I will watch her. - No, I can't. I promised Megan I'd meet her at the gallery. I have to get Ava ready. You can't bring a baby to a business meeting. I'm sure if I explain, they'll understand. You did promise me story time. Yes, I did. [soft music] Okay, thank you. Bye, baby. Oh, my sweet little baby. You look just like your daddy. - You started without me. - How's it going? Honestly, I have no idea. - How are you doing? - I'm okay. I'm so sorry to drag you out here after yesterday. It's just the gallery schedules are filling up really fast. I'm just so grateful to be here, thank you. - Your work is wonderful, okay? - You deserve to show it. Impressive, quite impressive. Thank you. And I believe your last show here was a success? A complete sellout. Well, that speaks well of the possibilities of your being here. Before we make any final decisions, I'd like to see a catalog of all of your currently available work. Oh, I'm afraid I don't have an up-to-date catalog. My last year has been so hectic. - Making so much art. - Right? It would be tough to pick which pieces to put in a show, but we could get you a catalog in no time. - Oh, excellent. - I can't wait to see it. So nice to meet you, Ms. Reynolds. And you, Ms. Devereaux. I can't believe that went so well. I have no idea how I'm gonna get a catalog together in that time. It's simple. Just get some high resolution photos, send them to me. I've got the greatest printer. He'll even do the graphic design for you. And I can come by later and help you with the photos if you want. Hallie? What is it? - It's that guy again. - What guy? - You know, from the café. - He chased me home that night. - Somebody chased you home? - Seriously? - He's across the street. - Look. Hallie, I don't... - Are you okay? - Yeah, yeah. I-I didn't get much sleep last night. Sleep deprivation, it can be really serious. Is anything else happening? Maybe... I don't know. I mean, Lynne is just showing up out of nowhere. She comes in and out of the house like she owns the place. And I think she was even in my studio. - Wait, really? - Yeah. You know that painting with the slash? It got worse. And I did not do that. She's the only one with a key to the house. And last night, my door was open, my kitchen door. And I know that I locked it. I know I did. You have to get that key back. I don't have any proof, though. How much more proof do you need? James is just so excited to have her back in his life, and I really don't want to mess up their relationship. Hallie, she's messing with your head. I mean, that's not just dangerous for you. It's dangerous for Ava, too. - I'm fine. - It's probably nothing. She loves James, and she adores Ava. Yeah, Hallie. Sometimes love makes people do crazy things. - I don't know. - Come on, let's go. Lynne, Ava, I'm home! Hush, hush. I just got Ava down for her nap. It took forever. She's way off her schedule. Sorry. It's just so important for children to have a schedule. It gives them a sense of safety, stability, something to rely on. Yes, children do need reliability in their lives. I'm just gonna put this away. [gasps] What? [gasping] Shh, I just told you, Ava is finally sleeping. Give me your key and get out. - What? - You heard me. I will not be playing these mind games. - You think that I did that? - Hallie, I would never... You were the only one here. Yes, but I didn't do that, I swear! I don't know what you think you're doing, but just because you missed out on your family doesn't mean you can have mine. You think that's what I'm doing? Just give me your key and leave. Fine. I'm going for now. But this is my family, too. You can't get rid of me that easily. What? One, two, three, four, five... What? Lynne. Yeah, I hear what you're saying, Doctor. It's just these pills, they're making me fuzzy. And I feel like there's something wrong with the batch. Okay, Hallie, I can write you a new prescription, but don't stop taking the daily dose I gave you, okay? It won't be good for you. Okay, thank you. Okay, take care. What? No. Hey! [baby crying] Ava. [baby crying] Ava. Yes, okay. [grunting] Okay. What? No. Who's taking my baby? [Ava crying] Ava? [continues crying] Ava! Mommy's in here! Hey! Ava, hey, hey! Hallie, what the hell are you doing? Whoa, whoa, whoa. Relax, relax, relax. What were you doing in the garage? What are you doing here? You told me to come home as soon as I could. I got the earliest flight this morning, Baby, what the hell are you doing in the garage? I came in here to get something, and the door locked behind me. Baby, lower your voice, okay? It was not locked. It was not locked. - Yes, it was. - I couldn't get out. I could hear her crying, and I couldn't get out. - It was not locked. - It wasn't even stuck. I opened it as soon as I turned the knob. - Yes it was. - I... look. - What's happening? - Look. Try to catch your breath and relax, okay? I'm gonna go put her down. Why don't you meet me in the living room? Can we turn this thing off for one minute while we talk? - But Ava... - I opened the door. We'll hear her if she needs us. And our phones... I don't want any work interruptions. Off. Tell me what's going on, baby. The fact is, some nights, I am not sleeping well and some nights, not at all. My mom called. She said she found you asleep holding Ava. And I bet she couldn't wait to tattle on me. No, Hallie, it was not like that. She's very concerned for both of you. James, she has been playing mind games with me ever since you left. - What does that mean? - I don't know what that means. She has been messing with my paintings, with my pills. She's been messing with your pills? - Yeah. - Hallie, are you taking them? - Yes, yes. - Be honest with me. Yes, yes, I am taking them, and I even mark a calendar every time I do until she started messing with that, too. And what about your painting? What did she do to your painting? You know that portrait I started last year? There is a big splash of red paint right across my face. I mean, why would she do that? That's terrible. Can I see it? - I threw it out already. - It was disturbing. Huh. You don't believe me. No, I believe you, Hallie. I believe you, but I just... I believe something's going on. I'm trying to figure out what it is. That something is your mother. Look, I know she came on strong. Okay, she's a handful. I know, trust me. But, baby, your paintings and your pills? I just don't see why she would do that. Why would she do that? How can you possibly understand her motivations? She is my mother. Who you haven't talked to for 15 years. Who knows what she's been through in that time? I'll go talk to her, okay? See if I can straighten some of this out. Thank you, and I know that my lack of sleep is messing with my ability to function properly and take care of Ava, but I am working on that, I promise. Is there anything I can do to help? Be home more? I would sleep better if you were home. - You know I want to be here. - I know. And I am so, so grateful for everything that you do. I'm grateful for you. [soft music] We'll figure it out, I promise. - Everything okay? - Yeah, everything's amazing. I haven't slept that well in ages. - That's good, baby. - That's good. Whoa, whoa, whoa, where you going? Come on, let's do it a little bit more. Jump on in. The water's fine. - Okay. - Oh, yeah. [doorbell rings] Who is that this early? I'm gonna go. Oh, I think you got it. You can do it. Come on. You're the best. I love you. - Ugh. - You light up my world. - Hi. - Megan, hey. - Are you okay? - Is Ava? - Yeah, she's fine. - What are you doing here? Just got worried when you didn't return - any of my calls or texts. - Oh, my gosh. I told you I'd get back to you about the pictures. I'm so sorry. I turned my ringer off. James got home early so we just had a quiet night in. - James? - Yeah, James. - My husband. - Hey. - Everything cool down here? - Yeah, this is Megan. She's just checking in. Megan Devereaux. The one I was telling you about. This is James, my husband. - Nice to finally meet you. - Hallie's told me so much. Thank you for doing all that for her, by the way. - Oh, please, no. - I haven't done anything. Well, if you're okay, I guess I'll just be on my way. I really am sorry. I just... you just seemed rattled lately and, you know, that stuff you told me, seeing people. But I'm glad everything's okay. Why don't we meet up for lunch later with Ava and we can talk about the catalog? - That'd be great. - Okay, I'll see you then. And it was nice to meet you. - Yeah, you too. - Bye. That was kind of weird, you know? She was, like, extra worried about you. Oh, she's just caring. Caring enough to come all the way over here first thing in the morning? What was that about you seeing things, what? - Nothing. - Hallie. Maybe there's more going on than anxiety and insomnia. - Why didn't you tell me? - Are you okay? I mean, I feel fine. I'll just... I'll make another appointment with the doctor. - Okay? - Please. - Go, have a good run. - See you soon. I just feel so much better when he's here, you know? Well, it's so great that James was able to come home from his trip early. It really is. You know, I have to admit that when I saw the car in your driveway, I thought maybe you had gotten more help, you know, after Mary. I'm here for you if you want to talk about it. You know, we're always talking about me, and Ava, and my problems. - I don't mind. - Let's talk about you. - Okay, if you insist. - Your mom. You told me that she got you into Art PR. Yeah, my mom was great. She just really wanted to help other artists. Watercolors were her favorite. You do a lot of work with watercolors, too. You work a lot with watercolors. Hallie, Hallie? Is everything okay? Yeah, watercolors. It's more acrylics these days. I think I prefer the paint on the canvas, you know, the textures. This is what I was working on yesterday. - Oh, I love that. - I don't know about that. Lynne? What are you doing here? I thought James was coming to see you. He was, he told me to expect him after his run. But that was over two hours ago. I've been trying to reach him. I can't get a hold of him. I come here. No one is home. It's going straight to voicemail. Something terrible has happened. I just know it. - I have location sharing. - Let me see. It says he's at the hospital. - The hospital, call! - Yeah. Hi. Hi, this might be nothing, but do you have a James Reynolds there? As a patient, I mean. I'm Hallie Reynolds, his wife. A coma? Oh, oh my... Yeah, we'll be there as soon as we can. - It's okay, it's okay. - You two, get to the hospital. Okay? Ava can stay with me. You know you can trust me, right? - Okay, thank you. - Sweetheart, I'll drive. Thank you. It's gonna be okay. - Thank you. - It's gonna be okay, sweetie. I just talked to the doctors. He's in serious but stable condition. And there's no major organ damage. But they won't know the extent of his brain injury until he wakes up. I just feel so helpless. Why do you hate me so much? - What? - We both love James. We both love Ava. I don't hate you. I just don't understand why you would... I did not do that to your painting. I know that you think that I did, but I didn't. I know you don't believe me, but it's true. And I know that I have come on way, way too strong. I was just trying to prove that I could be useful, that I could somehow know what a mother is supposed to do. So I've been reading articles and learning. It breaks my heart because I missed so much. You know, all those little things that you're soon gonna be taking for granted. Those badly-iced homemade birthday cakes that tasted so good and those inside jokes that only we understood. I was a terrible mother. Lynne, James was so excited when you wanted to be back in his life again. You must have done something right to make him feel that way. And you knew that something was wrong with him. Your instincts were amazing. I wish I had that with Ava. Every time something little happens, it just rattles my nerves, and I don't even know how to trust myself. I know something about that. When James came along, I was the exact same way. But you, you're very, very smart. And you're very confident. You're a wonderful mother. When you really need it, those instincts are gonna kick in, and there will be no doubt. - Thank you. - So listen to your instincts. What are they telling you to do? I think I need to go be with Ava. Then go. I love you so much, baby. And Ava loves you, and we'll be back soon. Hallie, this is Matthew, my boyfriend. It's nice to meet you. If I can do anything... I'll see you soon. Let's get you all changed. Nice diapey. There we go. It's okay. I'm here, baby. Poor little Ava. So much has happened to you. There you go, sweet girl. You're so sweet. Look at how beautiful you are. [baby crying] Let's get you changed. Hallie, you're home. Hey, how's Ava? - She's good. - I just got her down. I really want to see her. So can I talk to you just for a minute? Yeah, sure. I know it's not my place. But I'm a little worried about you. Why? Those pills that you're taking? Are they working? Maybe your doctor has you on the wrong... It's none of your business. I was just asking because I care. Yeah, I'm sorry. What are those pills you're taking? In college, I had anxiety, racing thoughts, panic attacks. But it got better. And I didn't really have any problems until Ava was born and we found out about her heart. So, I started seeing a doctor, and that's what the pills are for. I was supposed to make another appointment but then James... Hey, why don't you let me take care of that for you? - I can do it. - I know you can, okay? But you have had a terrible day, and you need to focus on your family. I'm happy to do it. Tell me what your doctor's name is. Dr. Sotto, Ruth Sotto. I'll handle it. I made you dinner, too. It's in the fridge. Promise me that you will eat it. Thank you so much. Hey. I'll be back in the morning to check on you, okay? Okay. Bye. [baby crying] Ava? Mommy's coming! [baby crying] What? [baby crying] Ava? Honey, honey, Mommy's got you. Hey, are you okay? Oh, God, baby. I know, I know, I know. It's okay, baby. I got you. [knocking] Okay. Are you okay? I called, but you never picked up. I, um... - What happened? - I don't know. I woke up, and Ava was in the laundry basket in the kitchen, and I think someone broke in, and... I'm sorry. I have to change her. It's okay, baby. Hallie, I checked all the windows. No one broke into your house just to mess it up. - They must have. - No, the back door is locked. There's no signs of forced entry. - I think I would remember. - Would you? I... what? It's that guy again! He just ran behind our house! Hallie, you're seeing things that aren't there. No, I'm not! Oh, Hallie, what did you do? - I-I got rid of that. - I know I did. Your mother-in-law hasn't been here, and James is in the hospital. It's only you here. But I couldn't, I... I threw this out. I know I did. I-I don't remember. - What is wrong with me? - I don't know, but I think it's time for you to admit that you're not okay. No, but I am okay, and I am fine, and I'm not crazy. Hallie, you're seeing things that aren't there, okay? You're doing dangerous and scary things and not even remembering it. You're putting Ava at risk. - No, I would never. - Do you really know that? Do you know that for sure? What if I hurt my baby? What if I hurt Ava? I'm gonna get you help, okay? I know a place. It's called Arden Pines. I'm gonna take you there, and they're gonna make sure that you don't hurt yourself or anyone else, okay? - But what about Ava? - And what about James? They don't even know when he's gonna wake up. It's okay, it's okay. I'll stay with Ava until you're better. It's gonna be okay. - Okay. - Come here. It's okay. It's gonna be okay. - Oh, gosh. - What? Nothing, I just have to stop at home real quick. - Okay, I'll just be a minute. - Where are you going? I just need to grab something real quick. Okay. [babbling] [indistinct yelling] Hey, baby. I can't leave you here, Ava. Come on. Megan? Where are you? What? What? Megan doesn't have any kids. - Don't touch him! - [crash] - No, no, no, no! - Don't touch him. Are you okay? What... this is the guy, the one I've been telling you about, the one that's been following me. - What happened? - He attacked me. - Well, who is he? - I don't know! - We have to call the police. - Okay. I'll call the police. You stay here and watch him. No, wait, Megan, I saw the pantry with the monitors. Why are you watching my house? What's going on? I just... I'm sorry, okay? You said that there was a guy following you, so I got worried. I just wanted to keep an eye on you and Ava. But that doesn't make any sense. - Where is Ava? - Is she okay? She's in the nursery. But you said you didn't have any kids. - What? - I have to call the police. - Wait. - What? - Do you have any kids? - No, I don't, okay? I will explain later. You stay with him. Don't move. Don't move, don't move! She's calling the police. No, she's not. What? I'm Luke Devereaux, Megan's husband. But she didn't say anything about being married. - There's no time for that now. - She's after your daughter. What? Ava has your baby's heart? Oh, my... Wait! Megan, please stop. Put Ava down. Put that down. Really? "Sometimes miracles are just good people with kind hearts." That's what your painting said. But sometimes miracles are kind hearts in good people, just like my little Lily's heart ended up in Ava. - Please don't do this. - I thought we were friends. You know, I realized something really important when you sent me that painting. I could have my little miracle again. I could have Ava. I have to have Ava. Please, just... let's think rationally about this. What could possibly be rational about losing my baby? I need to thank you for the gift of Lily's heart. You were faced with an awful decision at the worst moment in your life. And you chose life the day you decided to donate Lily's kind, strong, beautiful heart to Ava. And I could never thank you enough for that. Please, Megan, please. Choose life now. I'm so sorry. I never meant it to be like this. It's okay. - But she's mine! - Ahh! [grunting] No! [grunting] [whimpering] [grunting] [baby crying] Lily? No, no! [whimpering] She's mine, she's mine! [shrieks] Megan, get off her! Get off her. Megan, get off her! - It's over, Megan. - No, no! - No, no, no! - Get up, get up! - She's mine, she's mine! - It's over! - I've already called the police. - No, she's mine! It's over. - Lily. - Lily is gone, Lily is gone. - It's over, it's over. - Lily, no! It's over, it's over. It's over, it's over. Lily is gone, Lily is gone. [baby crying] [radio chatter] I am so sorry. I knew that Megan was having a hard time accepting Lily's passing. She was obsessed. And I watched her get worse and worse. I just never thought... - Why not just tell me? - Why follow me? - I was trying to help her. - Protect her, I guess. I didn't want her to get in trouble. Just... it might cost her medical license, and she'd already lost so much. - Medical license? - I thought she was an art PR. - No, she's a psychiatrist. - Her mom was an art PR. That explains how she got me to trust her. Did she work in a place called Arden Pines? Yes. She was trying to get you to commit yourself there. 'Cause that's where once you're in, she'd keep you there forever. She would keep Ava. But James would... I didn't know how dangerous Megan could be until... I mean, I just found out that she ran your husband down. I think that she might be responsible for your babysitter's death and tampering with your pills and the paintings inside. I don't know. You were put in a really difficult position. I was starting to think that I was crazy. - Crazy? - Yeah, no. She's very good at making you feel like you are. Losing Lily without getting to say goodbye, it was a terrible thing for Megan. [police radio chatter] - Wait. - Wait, wait, wait, please. He told me you never got to say goodbye to your daughter. Goodbye, Lily. You didn't have to do that, not after everything she did to you. But I did. I almost went through the same thing. [soft music] The show is completely sold out. Can I get a picture with the hot new artist? And would you like one with your family? Yeah Hi, baby All right, let's take a photo, everyone Get on in here. Lynne, you too.
