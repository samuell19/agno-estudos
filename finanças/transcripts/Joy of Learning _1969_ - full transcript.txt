12,247 images speak of her. 22,843... 72,000... 127,000... 444,000 males speak of her. About 2,600 meters. 127,000 will be faithful. Ouch! No, don't move. I'm also stopping. It's anti-atomic umbrella. Yes, but I use it as a reflector of consciousness. Who are you? Where are you going? Where do you come from? She comes from underneath the sea. She was a third world delegate for the new Citro?n factories in the North Atlantic. She was fired for giving pocket tape recorders with printed circuits to the employees. So that they could record all of the abuse from the French bosses. Her name is Patricia. She's the daughter of Lumumba and the Cultural Revolution. Said he. - Emile Rousseau. - Said she. We know, in fact, that the opposition to the Left obtained from its accomplices in the government that schooling in France be obligatory until the age of 55. This morning, 25,000 urban youths, including Emile, happily presented themselves to the opening of classes at the College of Sciences in the city of lights. But there was a sign that said classes were full and the doors were guarded by the 18.4th Armored Regiment of Parachutists. Since Emile and his schoolmates wanted to enter by force, the dean of the college called the Minister of Civil War for him to order the parachutists to fire on them. The works of mathematician Laurent Schwartz, which had been presented to the Russell Tribunal two months before, served to calculate the angle of firing, since it was the same used by the B-52s when their white phosphorus bombs destroyed the silk factories of Hanoi. That's how Emile was shot in the heart. Luckily, he carried under his sweater the latest issue of Les cahiers du cin?ma. His injury was minor. Why did you do that? Question of method. And yourself? Me... Me. Me. Learn. Make them learn. And it's up to me to turn the weapon against the enemy with which they attack our language. Yes, learn. All we wanted was to learn. To have the three To's. - Which are? - To read. To write. To count. In the end, it's not a very funny problem. Nope. - We have to find a solution. - We're not going to stay here. And naturally, as always, we're all alone. Obviously, since we're in the Middle Ages. France is still a democracy, and the Party isn't ready to take over. After all, maybe we're not as alone as we think. After all, yes. We're on TV, right? Yeah, so? Television is in all households. Why couldn't we be as well? A home, isn't that an optical thing? And in South America, there are the homes of the revolution. So we should go into people's homes and ask, so that we can learn more. First, to learn more. Then we'll see. Yes. First, to learn. That's not bad. Okay. To learn. A society, in church. Rousseau. Until the end of the earth. And I searched. At its simplest expression. So, his call... And finally, we... People have decided to... We can't really understand. Of course, they're speaking out of order. We're all German Jews! We're all...! We can't really understand. Of course, they're speaking out of order. - And for the rest... - Solida... We can't really understand. And for the first time... Of course, they're speaking out of order. I think that... - I had gone. - To the ends. - Of the earth. - Searching for. What Rousseau calls. Progress almost unaffected. - Its. - Beginnings. - And I. - Looked for a society. - Reduced to its simplest. - Expression. The society of the Afranics was at the point where all I could find were men. - The Afra-what? - Afranics. A-F-R-A-N-I-C-S. N-A-F-A-R-I-C-S. F-R-A-N-?-A-I-S, French. Yes, it's the French of the year 2000, the Afranics. After the mutations of the computers. Yes. In the universities, we can meet... This disorder is really getting annoying. No, listen, we study links, relations, differences. Organized like this, we can put into function the factories and universities for the profit of the national collectivity of all. This disorder is really getting annoying. No, listen, we study links, relations, differences. The armed forces of the state can do nothing against them. Well, then, off to work. Might as well study that. We'll start over from scratch. No, before starting over, we must go. - We'll go back to zero. - And once we get there? Well, we'll look around, see if there are any traces. Deep down, we're going to search for what's left. It's true, for social studies, it's not about composing man, but to dissolve him. - Is that it? - Yes, of course. Of course. To find the solution, whether chemical or political, one must dissolve. Dissolve hydrogen, dissolve parliament. Here, we're going to dissolve image and sound. - C-I? - T. - E. - N. - E. - L. - M-A. - E. V-I-S-I-O-N. T-E-L-E-V-I-S-I-O-N. C-I-N-E-M-A. C. I-N-E. M. A. T. E. L-E. V-I. S. I. O-N. Images, do we choose them? Or do we encounter them by chance? By chance, since we don't know exactly what they are. Any image. That's not very scientific. I don't agree. Chance is structured just like unconsciousness. The mentality of education is... As well in... Our unions have... We're made to... - Student! Unity! - Well, everything went... - The protest that... - The President... Equality! So, in an image, we must discover a method. Yes, we must find the discourse of its method and ours as well. But then we must not forget to self-criticize ourselves afterwards. And if we find this method, it will give us laws of fabrication. At the very least, reference points. Therefore, maybe one day, the fabrication of images will be based off known things, as opposed to unknowns, as they are currently created in Hollywood, in Moscow, in the RTF studios in Paris, at the BBC in London, at the R.A.I. in Italy, at the Shochiku in Tokyo, etc. The first image. You're only speaking of images. You've forgotten sound. No, I haven't forgotten. It's the same thing. But we can isolate them. In isolated, there is "isle". We are also isolated. An isle. - Robinson. - Yes, Robinson. We must absolutely not imitate him. - He was a fascist. - Robinson? Yes. In evidence, he immediately made Friday his slave. What we need to discover are images and sounds that are free. For example, say "oh". I told him say "say", and now, Stalin. I told him "say", and now, Stalin. Theoretically, these two sounds have nothing to do with one another. No. But they could eventually have a connection. Yes, so what we need to know is what separates them. To know... Mark off in time and space, this silent word that separates them. You, my comrade. You that I ignored, behind the turbulences. You who are arrested, frightened, asphyxiated. Come. Talk to us. And when we'll know, when we'll use those two sounds together, their connection will inevitably be correct. To know all this, we must investigate its base. - It will be hands-on work. Theoretical as well. Theoretical. In every image, we must know who speaks. I told Patricia, "Yes, but without an investigation, no right to speak." - Well... - We must find the truth in the facts. What are the facts exactly? - It's. - It's. - The things. - The things. - And. - And. - The phenomenons. - The phenomenons. - As they. - As they. - Exist. - Exist. - Objectively. - Objectively. So, that's what we said. The truth, it's the internal place of these things and phenomenons, meaning the laws that govern them. To research is to study. We have to study. I told him, otherwise there's no possibility of television. Not a true television, in any case. And not a commercial-filled television like in France. I told her, no cinema either. Not a true cinema, in any case. Therefore, no true images, nor any true sounds, unless we study them first. What will we do the first year? We'll pick up images, we'll record sounds, like we said. It will create unorderly experiences. Actions, hypothesis. Yes, and the second year, we'll criticize it all. We'll decompose, we'll reduce, we'll substitute, and we'll recompose. Okay. And afterwards, the third year, we'll create a few samples of sounds and images. My practice will not be blind, since you will have enlightened it with your revolutionary theory. My theory will not be without object since it will be linked to your revolutionary practice. Look, the day begins. - I'm leaving. - Me too. - I'll see you tomorrow night, then. - Okay, same place, same time. - Bye. - See you tomorrow. Bye. - Hello. - You're late! It's two in the morning! What the hell were you doing? In the West, the massacre of the red earth, forgotten under the tons of steel and iron, under the appearance of possession, ancient and crisped, with a shown sex and without a sex. In the East, the accumulation of history and the black earth, violence that springs when wanted, which surges from the marsh of time, and little by little, covers the adversary from whom hope has been taken. In the West, the masses. In the East, the people. In the West, the images. In the East, the scene. In the West, signs without roots, accumulating, signs without any hold on the deep axe of the exterior. Signs that reflect to the tiny interior of skulls, at the nervous torsion, deeply divided by common ownership, at the knocked out hallucination, only to trace. In the East, the invisible force of the complete mutation of the square writing that takes to the surest ground, the communal inscription made of skin and blood, the marred thought that knew how to think, each of the appearances that we can see realized, is the product of the appearance that it needs to produce itself. In the East, during the night, the past is suddenly erased, the simple indestructible force of the line. It's precisely like this that the moon must have been created and fueled. Understand how that which slides throughout the years and centuries became for you, to the point where water has become superficial. How it's now about a revolution, not by pairing substances or units, but by continents and integral texts, but by continents and integral texts. You no longer recognize the world of your language. You now walk far from these long and discreet signs. You are located at the crossing of unfastened forces. Obligated to see them sink in their divided and differentiated multitudes. You can no longer forget what can be called the definitive passage of lines through steel lungs. Infinity is a gigantic animal, although it has no specific features or any senses that can report back from the exterior into itself. With this perspective, the circular motion around a center disappears, as well as the movement of corral rocks attacking birds, transforming them in their glides to the depths into a closed book, although the stories continue. A double trajectory, risen from a force without guarantees, and the question that is then asked is farther than your memory, asks how to note at the same time the form and the sense, by which link, tension and opposition can be translated into a sentence. There's nothing in the world that develops in a totally equal manner. This time, it turns over itself, embeds, spreads and multiplies. Designating the moment, we work over here. There, this is what really works where the Reds still fight against you, fight and will fight again and again, without respite. Meanwhile, the story continues. - Come on, the day begins. - What are you doing today? With Michel, we're going to break the slumber of Laida Damo. While they sleep, we beat them up and steal their dreams, and in turn, sell them to France Dimanche and Marie-Claire. And then, we give the money away. - Okay, good-bye, comrade! - See you tomorrow night! This isn't serious. It's 3:00 a.m. Where were you? let me tell you at the risk of seeming ridiculous that the true revolutionary true is guided by great feelings of love. The images are going by too quickly. We have to react. You're too romantic. A cultural revolution doesn't happen in one day. We said we'd criticize all this next year. It is intolerable that the guns command the Party. Okay. We're in a bit of an intellectual war right now, no? Yes, I said to Emile. I told Patricia, let's try to make an immediate criticism anyway, without waiting for next year, where we'll criticize ourselves anyhow. Yes, it's true, it's wrong of me to forget, I said, that the students of Paris, in the beginning of May 1968, proved, by their bloody sacrifice, the truth of the Cuban theories, faced with cultural immobility, and often reactionary worker unions... Judged to be undesirable in France! evening speech It's possible to say that eroticism is the recognition of life until death. Until death. Until death. To understand is to discover the common ownership of a series of different facts. more precisely first year more precisely first year more precisely In May 1968, I voted for the socialism on the barricades, by participating in the general strike. The history of man is that of his repression. The return of that which had been repressed constitutes the underground and taboo history of civilization. The exploration of this history not only hides the secret of the individual, but also that of civilization. There is no neutral science. Scientists, there is no neutral science. The scientists collaborated with Hitler and Johnson. There is no neutral science. There is no neutral science. There is no neutral science. We can say all we want about what see, but what we see is never lodged in what we say. or If you want to see the world, close your eyes, Rosemonde. Close your eyes, Rosemonde. Close your eyes, Rosemonde. - The day begins, I have to hurry. - To do what? Get photos taken in my underwear for L'Humanit? Dimanche. Why not ask an agency? No, at L'Humanit?, in the feminine magazines of the C.G.T. they show the same lingerie photos than in the Figaro. I find that disgusting. Revolutionary women's underwear should be photographed differently than in the reactionary press. - Bye. - See you tomorrow night! The majority of students have currently adopted the slogan: The Sorbonne belongs the students! We do not agree with this slogan. We would prefer by far: The Sorbonne is for workers! Second problem... Here, what can we say? What should we say? Here's what I propose: First, theory, second, practice and tactic, okay? Number one, theory, strategy, therefore create discourse. Number two, and so, form thus the grammar. And so, the theory is born from the practice which conditions it. And so, the form creates the content. The S.W.A.T. team is in the Sorbonne. The students are outside. The S.W.A.T. team stays at the Sorbonne, the students block the entry, and it could last a long time. Here's our new slogan: The Sorbonne belongs to the S.W.A.T. team! My comrades could believe that it's not... ... a sort of bond with the workers, the slums. And so, we propose that if the S.W.A.T. team wants the Sorbonne, it can keep it. We can turn the Sorbonne into a garrison house for the S.W.A.T. team. ... a Saint-Ouen. She said to me, if we went live with a random Afronic via satellite? "Soviet or American?" I asked.

They refuse to project the films in their original versions. Since the invention of talkies, they still haven't seen a film talk. It's unbelievable. Terrifying. They would prefer a slave sound to a free sound. They must be punished. - Yes, okay. Bye. - See you tomorrow night. from now on we will no longer accept any kind of blatant truths we don't believe that there exists blatant truths blatant truths belong to the bourgeois philosophy The scientists collaborated with Hitler, Johnson, Stalin, de Gaulle. Films from the Third World. Unobstructed films. Films, etc. You too, little Western girl, pass the word of Lumumba, but also that of Michel Servet, who gave his blood, so that it may flow like his ideas. For the Marxist-Leninist students, the main task is to teach with the working comrades. As a Marxist-Leninist, it is not about giving weapons to the working comrades, but to teach them how to forge some and to teach each other. An erroneous style of work is the expression of an erroneous policy. To implement a bourgeois style of work to the study of Mao's words is to implement a bourgeois policy. Let's turn our attention to the clinic. And let's first take into consideration the pleasure of... To work and study, as a Marxist-Leninist, the words of Mao Zedong, we need to reform our study. Only the Little Red Book can lead us to the true Marxist-Leninist methods to study the words of President Mao. A certain kind of peeping Tom comes when he imagines... sound analyze There's still an artistic program over there. Not piece by piece, but by large quantities. Always new things. Listening to your own voice. With what speaks... - With who? - No. With what do you speak? I talk like everyone else talks. If we say something, then we must do it. Close your mouth. There are no more teeth growing. So, if we do something, we must say it. To speak alone is to listen to yourself talk. I'll start over. Everyone that talks. Listening to your own voice. Close your mouth. There are no more teeth growing. Exactly. If we say something, we must do it. So, if we do something, we must say it. Funny thing, you have here. Really funny thing. I was talking about mouths and teeth no longer growing, and this thing also talks about teeth no longer growing. Analysis of sound through image. Sunday morning, the whites became green, so I saw red. Now, analysis of image through sound. My sex is black, and I spend sleepless nights preparing Molotov cocktails. Here, the sound is missing. The CIA killed the sound technician who had recorded the voice of Camilo Torres, who denounced the alliance of the Vatican with the American Secret Service. Here, the image is missing. The Anglo-Canadian police gouged out the eyes of a cameraman who was filming the landscapes and faces of a free Quebec. Here, the sound is missing. The French upper management asked the government and its police to beat up the reporters who were recording the sighs of the workers facing their hellish work pace. 2nd year (continued) Situation: Critical University: Critical knowing Self-Critical free film Fidel: I will disgust youth from money. I will disgust youth from money. The conflicts of a child, I said, are not conflicts with reality, but originate from the subject's inability to identify himself. So, what is being questioned is the image of oneself. Yes. I said, the image of oneself. And her? The image of nylon. Me, the image without the dot on their "i". Me, reflex image. Me, virtual image. Or aerial. Me, the image from a book. Me, magnetic image. Me, image that gives away the key to freedom and cinematography. I added that we had to be careful not to fall into the ideology of the real. Trap that isn't always avoided by great filmmakers such as Dreyer, Bresson, Antonioni, Bergman. Yes, but then what is a false image? Where are the true images and sounds? I'm 84 years old. I'm 30 feet tall. I'm wearing a yellow sweater. I'm 20 years old. - Listen, it's clear. - Because you know me. I'm 5'4"... Imagine de Gaulle talking to the students, Johnson to the Vietnamese, Franco to the workers. - It would immediately be less clear. - My blue sweater. ...unionized Spanish workers. But the leaders of the Paris branch of the student union needed an entire night's discussion to analyze a face to... I'm 84 years old. - In this image and sound... - I am 33 feet tall. - You have to be able to... - My sweater is... - Yes and no. - Yellow. Yes, for the effort to make... No, because within an image and sound, nothing is stable. So, it's about grasping a movement. I'm 5 feet tall. - The solution to these... - My sweater is blue. ...to these contradictions within the people. film - social - critic And now a minute of silence in sound to the memory of the Black Panthers killed in San Francisco by the FBI's hit men. And now a minute of silence in images, in particular, for the memory of the Afro-Asians and their friends beaten by the police of Kimole and Fran?ois Mitterrand. Who today are supposedly part of the opposition to the Left. And, in general, a minute of silence in images, for all the absent images, censored images, prostituted images, machinated images, delinquent images, buggered images, images beaten up by all the governments, televisions, and Westernized cinemas that rhyme information and repression with trash and culture. We hear when we are a part of what is said to us. The freedom of woman begins at her stomach. The freedom of woman begins at her stomach. Man is what he's done that we've done to him. 2nd Year A constant current Between the biological Nature of man And the constructions Of intelligence Must be established Must be established scientific film Exploration: The act of exploring a country.

And since sound is the union representative of the eye... It stands to reason that image then is the political office of the ear. in the trading of goods Here, Patricia is reading an alphabet that the Gaullist government distributes in elementary schools. She notices that every word given for a letter stems from the bourgeoisie. And that most of the genuine words, and their uses, are absent. For example, the letter B. There's the word "better", and its use says that brioche is better than bread. The proof is that de Gaulle and Pompidou speak to the workers of 1968 like Marie-Antoinette did to those of 1789. Yes, but then they'll say we chose this letter on purpose. Shit, it's not true. We can take any letter. Turn the pages at random, I say. Letter "A". There's the word "acquire" but not "art". Letter "S". There's "sensible" and "soap", but neither "sex" nor "syndicate". Letter "P". Neither "police" nor "psychoanalysis". Letter "C". Neither "culture" nor "capitalism", "class" or "combat". Letter "R". There's, of course, neither "revolution" nor "repression". Letter "F". There isn't "fascism", but there's "family" and "fries". And for the word "famished", the university Gaullists give this example: I feel famished when I arrive at the dinner table. And what about the Third World children who don't have tables? "No, this display is too easy," I told Patricia. Banks exist to lend money, and the dictionary to lend words. But what cannot be loaned out is the distinction between bills and between words. We write words in succession, not on top of one another. Images and sounds can be stacked on top of one another. Yes, because an image is never an image, but a contradiction of images. And it's the same for a sound. Okay. We return to the just contradiction within the people, reflected in their representation. No, not representation, but presentation. Not a show, but a struggle. first research into sound - He asked me. - What are you doing? - She answered. - I'm listening. In movies, we always see people talking, never listening. Because it's not definable. At least not easily, like dolphins. Patricia asked me, "Pompidou?" I said, "No, Pompidou is a shark." The fish then, I said. Emile said that they have a language which is strictly through sound, but at much higher frequencies than ours. We still can't define it in comparison to our own language. We ask ourselves whether it's derived from Chinese or Egyptian, rather than Latin. "As you can see," I whispered to Emile. "Sound is very mysterious," whispered Patricia. Regardless, we should be able to come closer than usual. second research on sound After she said this, I told her, "Do you remember on Friday, with Anne and Michel, when he said, 'Let's go act like idiots at the Pentagon?"' And she said, "Oh, yes." Remember, I made you notice it. The time she took to say, "Oh, yes." Yes. Let's attempt to reenact it. Let's go act like idiots at the Pentagon. Oh, yes! That's not it. Let's go act like idiots at the Pentagon. - Oh, yes! - That's not it either. No. It's strange, the intonation Anne had when she said it, the sound of it was very brief. But to come close to a correct definition of it, we would need... There was in this sound, all the latest Beatles albums, as well as all the novels by Gide. Thus, this simple sound is incredibly complex to transmit. Now, it's lost. Yeah, we should have recorded it. No, I did not say "reproduce". I said, "Transmit to someone, into someone, who is living." No, you see, we're unable to say it. Oh, yes! No, that's not it. - You see. - Yep. It's maybe because voice is the best expression of freedom. I told Emile that his great-great-grandfather had already discovered this. "What? Who did?" I asked Patricia. Jean-Jacques Rousseau. What is true of the citizen, is primarily true of those nude beings, offered to the power of others, the newborns. If we cannot recreate that sound, it's because we don't quite know what it is made of. Therefore, image merged so intimately with the sound it represents that it ended up usurping the lead role. The eye must listen before looking. The day is beginning, I have to go. - Where are you going? - To Besan?on, at the Rhodiaceta. The buddies are on strike. They're occupying the factories. Chris and I are going to project films for them. The Dictator and The Lamentesse. Bye! Okay. It will be day in an hour. This really isn't serious. - Protest. - Comrades, Cohn-Bendit... To the protest... Not welcome... Still, we don't know what it is. Yes, now the unit of time is defined by a natural physical phenomenon. Since 1960, the meter is a product of the wavelength, due to the radiation emitted by krypton 86. What about the second? Well, it's the transition between two super thin levels of the fundamental state of the tome of caesium 133 unperturbed by exterior fields. It's insufficient as a definition, no? It's insufficient as a definition, no? In any case, it allows rockets to be sent to the moon. That's not too bad. - Yes, but listen... - What? Listen. Listen. And because the ideas I received from the senses were much more lively, more expressive, and even, in their own way, more distinct than any of the ideas that I could simulate myself through meditation, or that I could find imprinted in my memory, it seemed that they could not have been processed from my soul. Yeah, so? The exact time of this excerpt, of the 6th Meditation of Descartes, not the time that Descartes took to write it, and even that, but even more difficult, the length of this speech... It's the time it took you to say it. No, that's my own time, through it. But it's time, not yours, nor Descartes', but its own. Yes. - It's not clear. - No, it's not clear. Yes, suddenly, I'm thinking... About what? Yes, there's something despicable about time. Yes. Yes. Eternity and infamy were born together. This proves that we need to start from scratch. Here, more evidence. Read. School will transform societal relationships by organizing the long term and abstract education of children who by their familial origins are destined to occupy society's highest places in management and administration. Then, through a shorter and simpler education, destined for the children of workers and peasants whose entrance in the professional world seems to require a limited education. Well read, Emile. That's how the governmental statements should be read on French television. Michel Debr?: Which youth do you need? Yes. To contest the current educational system and to elaborate solutions... Yes. We must understand that the evolution of the university of the past two years and those to come, is dictated by an objective. Yes. Its integration in the monopolistic capitalist system of the state puts itself exclusively at its service. We must also understand the phenomenon that Lenin picked up that the monopolistic capitalism of the state is the most complete preparation material of socialism. The anteroom of socialism, the phase in history that no other intermediary phase can separate from socialism. The step of assimilating these truths that Comrade Mao Zedong underlined. All that is reactionary is similar in that if we don't try to hit it, it's impossible to make it fall. It's like when we sweep, where the broom can't reach, the dust doesn't leave by itself. Worker's discourse. This signifies that it's useless to cry out like the revisionists do and request a democratic reform of the universities, because either this reform will make the universities return to a liberal bourgeois framework, which is impossible, considering the irreversible development of capitalism in our country, or it aims to obtain from the capitalists second-rate arrangements and in better conditions, even obtain integration in the educational system of a capitalist monopolistic state. This system can only be contested globally and can only be replaced by a socialist educational system. The battle will certainly be long, hard and... Worker's discourse. The socialist revolution will not be won in a day. It will necessarily require ideological preparations. Yes, worker's discourse! Yes, intellectual discourse. How many discourse levels did we say we have? Not bad, here already, she's thinking. - She is thought about. - And she a-thinks. And she is unthought-of of. 2nd year continuation and end. 3rd take.

Strange, is that what is called a new novel? I don't know. No matter, I know where it came from and how it works. "Where?" I asked. It's that guy who works at the university publications of France, next to the cash register. He's the one who wraps the books and gives them to those who buys them. Since he's too poor to buy the books, in the few seconds from the moment when he receives the book from the cashier, and he gives it back to the customer, he gives it a quick glance and learns by heart the little bit of text he's able to read. He's been there for 30 years. He started like that and learned the alphabet and multiplication tables. Today, he reads Faulkner and Chomsky. And the text you just read is the result of one hour of his work. Exactly. It resembles the fold-ins of Ferlinghetti and Burroughs. Maybe, in any case, it's a rare example of text-book. Of text, yes, but more precisely, the practical piece of the French literary production in which the worker... ...science of language should find natural links between speech and writing.

One is a long narrow cardigan with rounded pockets that one wears with a divided skirt made of red flannel, and a printed cotton shirt. There are deplorable abuses. We wrongly steal and kill. All the mafia heads are intoxicated by their power. However, near the end of Louis XIV's century, two men pierced the crowd of mediocre genius. I sometimes err in my operations. The squirrel has a long tail. Papa reads the newspaper every day. You will not be surprised to hear me say that the question to know whether the world can be represented through the theater is a social question. international film Here, the image is missing.

What the workers must learn from this lesson is at heart very simple.

Workers are strong when united through organizations that directly represent them, which are under their direct control. They are strong when united with the other workers, in organizations that represent their common interests, under common direct control.

It sometimes happened for me to sleep at your shoulder. That you beat me at the race, before me, in the dark night. And the sudden silence would fill me with fear. The anguish of being alone like a trial of death. And not just the fear of dying, I've always been resigned to that, but of this expanse in front of me, on all sides, like a forgotten path. Terrified, to find myself in front of a mirror without any images. To feel the shadow of an absent being detached from me. Engaged in a realm of dreams, where I have no place, where I cannot follow him. And even if tomorrow I learn, for him, followed... I won't believe any of it. And anyway, I would only have been attached to his steps for an instant. In this manner, I spent half of our life, in the streets, the metro, in this despair that if it sank, in the end, in my sleep, in my dreams, was only comparable to prison, a punished life, a sort of madness where I could even forget those that I had lost. I have never, in my life, awoken without wailing. A profound wail. Mute. Of all the justice of the night. Sometimes the feeling in me was so strong, that it remained with eyes open, for a long time, and you would ask me, what's wrong? And I couldn't tell you. Believing it was the fog of bad dreams, that was still obfuscating my gaze, and still struggling in the tangled memories of the shadows... Or else, in the consciousness of which the tale explains nothing. I would divert with calculated remarks, the resumed conversation, with yesterday's events or the occupations of the day ahead. And so, keep to myself, this almost present. This rupture of the depths, in the fashion of a pain that we hide. In my youth, I sometimes spoke of my dreams. It's been a long time since I've stopped doing so. This fear sometimes obscures existence. More and more, gaining on awakened life, of my silence, even. It would thrust upon me an awful doubt about all things. And foremost, about us, what made us be, to say us. To us, signifying you and me. To us, different from this plural we, which exists only in my presence and remains when its components diminish, augment, vary. One of these "we's" which are but extensions of me. This reality that you could, like me, destroy, better than me. I say all this without example, without order, in an abstract form, because depending on the discourse that I am, try as I might to turn toward you... My love. I know that it's but a trick of the stranded. I say you. I share things between you and me, as if it were nothing, and although I doubt this sometimes, it's through that, that I remember. That I still have my reason. Guerrilla Film. This face is a bottle. The eyes are the cap. The hair, a wick that descends into the bottle until the nose. The mouth and the chin being the bottom of the bottle. You throw this face smashing into a CRS in France, a Kapo in Germany, a Carabinieri in Italy. In short, against any other face of the repression. blue - film - flyer version - inter - red Morale is... a partisan of Israel is objectively a reac-zionist let's look The Party is at the same time the motor and the target of the revolution. let's listen SOCIALISM OF THE REGIONS let's criticize adhere to the P.C.F., P.C.I., P.C.B., P.C.U.S., to create 2 or 3 Vietnams let's look let's listen skin - red - the flag the cause of the people let's look let's criticize philosophers must ally themselves to the pariahs and the unemployed funny film Are you leaving? Yeah. Definitely? Yes. Where are you going? I'm taking the 10:17 Tupolev to Bratislava. Are you going to shoot another film? Yes, with Skolimowski. And you? Me? I don't know. You might as well stay here, if you want. - It's true. It was nice here. - Alas, alas, I cannot. Why not? They already programmed another show for this sound stage. - Yeah? - Yeah. It's too bad, half the shots are missing. Which ones? For example, you know that shot I liked, when I sang: There is no situation We can't address with a Marxist or Freudian analysis. Yes, but Bertolucci will shoot that one in Rome. Yeah? And there's also the shot where I asked you: - "What is an honorable family?" - Oh, right, the one where I answer: "A family in which everything is taboo." Yes. Yes, but Straub will shoot that one in Germany. Yeah, and there's... There's the one where we illustrated the pillaging of the Third World. Yeah, well, Glauber Rocha will shoot that one in Brazil. There's also the shot... Other filmmakers will shoot them! They will... They will for who? Well, they... They do it for the people. The people. We're still speaking of them? But we never see them. What are you writing? Mi so to di ment Misotodiment. It sounds like the merging of "method" with "sentiment". Is that it? Yes. I found this word, finally, to define images and sounds. - And you? - Me? This never was, never will be, because this is. It's not bad, either. Yeah. It's a bit vague, what we've discovered, no? In other words, this film is a failure. Yes. No, not really. In fact, not at all. Listen, what better ideal to propose to the man of today that is above and beyond themselves? Otherwise, regaining through knowledge of the void that they themselves discovered. - Godspeed, Juliet. - God is dead, Jean-Pierre. - So long! - Bye-bye! The film didn't want to, cannot want to explain cinema, nor constitute its object. But, even more modestly, give an efficient method of achieving it. This film is not the film that needs to be made. But how, if we have a film to make, we necessarily have to go through the well-known paths of films.
