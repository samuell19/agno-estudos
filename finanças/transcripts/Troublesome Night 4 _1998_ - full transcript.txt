Whatâ€™s wrong? Are you okay? Thank you. I had a nightmare. I saw someone running after me in my dream. Then, a car was about to run me over. Maybe, the wedding arrangement drives you nervous. Take a rest. Come on. Look at the lovers. They are like the couple in the film "Titanic", so romantic! You jump, I jump! Shut your poisoned lips! Why do you quote that tragedy while we are taking a plane? Why not?. That's a ship. You'd say something about airplane. An airplane crashed against people's houses in Taiwan months ago. Many people died. Why? Why? The plane once carried some dead bodies. What kind of bodies? Few months ago, there was an accident in Osaka Airport. That plane carried dead bodies who died in that crash. Sir, please don't say such thing on the plane please. Thank you for your co-operation. Let's go back to Titanic, it's romantic. Okay. We don't want to hear this. She is one of our tour-mates. This is either. My name is Leonardo. Dicaprio. Driver. I am a driver. You could never let me link you up with that movie star.

I am sorry, I have to go to toilet. You are really smart. I am sorry. It doesn't matter, my friend is really nice. I am sorry. No problem. Mr. Wong, will I be promoted after this trip.

This is K2, team 8 of China City Club. Do you remember me? How are you? How are you, where are you going to? I come for business. Why haven't you come to have fun in my club? I have been busy. What's wrong with this guy. He stays there for a long time. Look at him! He seems to be a smuggler. I think he is a drugs trafficker. You come with me, and take your belongings. Sir. Welcome to this 7 days tour in the Philippines. There are 70 million people living here. With three million Chinese. What is the proportion between men and women? The proportion is 1 to 7. It's great. But, it's a complicated matter about their sex behaviour. So. Number isn't an important problem. English is the official language. But usually they speak Philippine language. That is the language we usually here locally. Say, I am "Maganda". It's very easy to understand that, it means beauty. Remember this word. This will be useful. We are maganda too. This is a Catholic country Churches are found everywhere. So, isn't whoring prohibited in this country? Whoring? You mean whoring? Miss, would you please don't interrupt? Isn't it prohibited? Don't worry, guns and whores are commonly found here. Do you know what this is? I don't know. No, I am not a drug dealer. This is the ashes of human bone No, ...no drugs? I said, this is the ashes of human bone. Thank you, sir... sorry... You should have paper for importing such kind of thing. Sorry! My Company asked me to carry this, I don't know... That's your problem. You will be fined for this. Sure. Pal, that's why you asked me to bring it. This is an urn, not an ashtray. Luckily I've got death certificate and related papers. Otherwise I will be in deep shit. I'm getting married soon, I can't want it to bring me bad luck. That's why I need your help, I am sorry. I've asked someone to pick you up. I've been long waiting. I wonder! Has he gone for he didn't see me? Please go to Trades Hotel to stay a night. I will ask him to pick you up tomorrow. Alright, let's talk about it tomorrow. Tomorrow. Enjoy you staying here, sir. Thank you. Thank you. This is a big bed. Did you see anything? Did you see what I've just seen? It's horrible. Don't be afraid, it's gone... Come back again. No, but one more is coming. Dear tour-mates, We will wait for another tour-mate, then we'll go to dinner. You are the guy who got trouble in the custom this afternoon. Pal, were you beaten?

Sorry for bothering. You had a girl last night? Didn't you find one? How about you? I don't know what's wrong with this country. The girls are all cool, they want money as well as love. Damn it!

I am sorry... Mr. Wong, nice to meet you again! Are you going back to Hong Kong after finishing your job? No, no. Why are you hurrying to leave? Isn't it a nice place to stay? It is nice, but I want to find a better one. Let's run! He is weird. Pals, please come this way, I have something to tell you. We are waiting for keys, I'll take this time to tell you something. This is a Catholic country. So, there is a bible in each room. When you see that it is open, don't close it. How about a closed one. Don't be naughty to reopen it. This is opened. And it is underlined. St. Mark, chapter 14... During the last dinner, Jesus Christ predicted that... Judah would betray him. He followed Jesus for a long time but he couldn't resist temptation. Well, what do you want to say? Will you betray me? I won't betray you. If you flirt around behind me, that means a betrayal to me. That means... If I do it in front of you, that's not a betrayal. You silly girl. Room 115 to 120, this way, and the rest, please go that side. Don't mistake your rooms. K2, this way please. Sorry sir, you can't take this room. Hey man. This key is with the same number of the room. I failed to whore for days, I have got a temper, you know? Don't bother me. Sorry sir, you can't take this room. I think the receptionist has given you the wrong key. Is this room occupied? No. Then we take it. I will tell the receptionist about this. Sorry sir, you can't occupy this room. Why? Sir, this room is a room with view. And it is vacant, and it's a nice room. I go to office and take another key for you. Hey, you want tips? What am I going to do now? I'll fix him. Go ahead, you are the guide, you'd fix it. No problem... What a coincidence! We came by the same flight, remember me? Yes, we come here for our honey moon, would you? Join our tour for your next honey moon, would you? I've forgotten my card. Room 116, I'll send my card later. Alright. Bye bye. Bye bye. It's your fault, why take the coach? We should take a taxi instead. It's too easy to take a taxi in Hong Kong. We are in a different place, why not try a coach? Let's enjoy the scenery. Come on! Feeling better? The hot weather is killing me! Master, are you feeling better? Stop... Stop. Where are you going to? Why your picture is here? Did you come here before? No. But why is your picture here? Excuse me sir. Can you please tell me how come my picture is here? I am sorry, I don't speak English? Excuse me, do you speak English? Yes. Would you please translate for me?

When the Church moves, people will repent for their sins. And your trip here will be an unforgettable one. She is crazy, let's go. Hey. If you want to see me, this is my address. Let's go. Honey , would you mind answering my question? Go ahead. Do you like me wearing white clothes? what's it? Why do you bring only white clothes for me? Let's go watch table dance. You mean it? Are you telling me that you don't like it? Don't you want to follow me? You have to go? You are the boss! Don't blame me of any physical reaction. What do you think? It's nice. You think this is nice, I'll show you at home. Do you mean it? I'll dance if you behave well. Sure I will. Let's check and leave. Come on , let's watch another dancing. No, let's go home and watch you dancing. Alright, let's go. Check the bill. It doesn't cost much, they must have a lot of money You still want to come again? It's not too bad. Excuse me.

Few days ago, we met an old woman. She foresaw three things. First, we would meet an old friend. And then, what's the next? I foresee that you will go to bed within 24 hours. Why don't you believe me? Why don't you sing in Hong Kong? This is a good place. I don't want to see Tung Chee-Hua, you know? You know? His action is extremely slow and he is incapable. This is a good place. So, we are going to beg for a living soon, aren't we? You'd come here for begging? Good! Take my card. I am the chairman of the society for the singing beggars. Drop in if you have time. Bravo! You are the chairman! Yes. If I need begging. I'll come to you. Call me before you leaving, okay? Let's have a tea. Sure. - Bye bye. - Bye bye. What's wrong? A nightmare again? Nothing... You'd better go to sleep. This is close to the China Town. What do you suggest to eat tonight? Anything would do. What do want to eat tonight? I don't know! Are you feeding sick? Come and take a rest. I didn't sleep well last night. Let me buy you something to drink, OK? What do you want to drink? Coconut please. Take a seat. How much? Twenty dollars please. I want two. Why are you so nice to me? People said, if a husband wronged his wife, he'll treat her better. Did you do anything bad? Drink it first. Why do you keep this picture? Throw it! Alright, I'll throw it. Don't get angry, come on, drink it. What's wrong? The church is moving. Moving? No, it isn't. The witch said a church would move. No, it isn't moving. Here! You mean the inverted image? The people are repenting their sins. What's wrong with you? Tell me. Do you have a child with another woman? What do you want to say? Be frank to me. Have you had a child with another woman? Of course not! Please don't listen to her bull shit! Don't you trust me? But her come true! You saw the image of the church! Why don't you trust me? Hey... What are you doing? Let's have our own activities today. I would like to stay alone. Where are going to? I'll go back to the hotel myself. - Do you know the way? - Let me calm down. - Take care. - It's alright. You have the key, when should I go back? Are you thinking of your wife? You are not thinking of your wife. At lease you were not thinking of her for a second. It doesn't matter. No husband would always think of their wives. They always think of other girls. They have fantasy. Don't you think so? Yes! But so what? There is nothing wrong to have more experiences. But sometimes, you have take a risk. Do you ever think of... Have sex with other girls? I don't need to tell you. You don't to have to tell me, I know what is in your mind. What is in my mind? I'm not going to tell you. It seems that we have nothing to talk. Maybe, we've something to talk. Like what? Something that your wife would not like to know. But you need not tell her what you have done. Don't you know that a woman's faith is? Is just what's in her mind is not what she feels in reality. And a man's faith is that... He makes love with his wife, but he also wants to have sex with other girls. Excuse me. Wait. Do you keep my photo? Sorry. I lost it. Please! Keep this. I hope you'll always remember me. And you are always in my mind. Are you sure this is the place? Yes, just inside, go in and turn left. Inside? Yes. Thank you. You bother my sleep! Damn it! I'll kill you. The snake bother my sleep, so I want to kill it. Sir, massage... Oh, thank you... OK... Thank you. Thank you, sir. What are you doing? When did you appear? When you started to lose faith and trust. What are you doing? I know you want me. There is something I need to ask you. Is that true that my husband is having an affair? What do you think? I don't know. I want you to tell me. Is it because of my words, don't you think that's foolish? No, but what you have said had happened. I really want to know, Please tell me. The Bible said Eve listened to the snake and ate the apple. Because she believed it will give her wisdom. Peter denied Christ three times before dawn. Because he didn't believe that Christ will rise again. Jesus refused to worship Satan because he has faith in his Father. So what about my husband... This is all I can say, speak no more. Sorry, I'm married. Are you waiting for me? Are you waiting for me? You're back. Yes. I have had a deep thought, I should not lost faith in you. I have done something wrong too, I know you are loving me. Well, from now on, we shouldn't be easily affected by others. I am not, it's you, who is being affected. I am just caring about you. Do you really mean it? That means you are not angry with me? Promise, don't get angry again. Alright, let's go up. Wait. You picked that again. No, I didn't. Just throw it , let's go up. What's this? The old woman's words are true. You must have a mistress. You did have a baby with another woman, is that right? Do not listen to other's bull shit, would you? Why don't you trust my words instead? I won't believe you! Don't lose your temper in public, OK? I love you so much, but you have a mistress! Let go of me! I wanna go! I don't want to see you! Let go of me! Apple Wing... Wing... Do you need some help? Yes, please. What can I do? Do you want to call an ambulance? Go, quick. Wing... If you don't trust your husband, why did you marry him? Wing... Look! Where? Over there. Someone died in a crash. What a coincidence! They took the same flight with us You jump, I jump", remember them? You had to cross the road carefully! Do you want to take my advantage? And you too! And you too! Yeah... It doesn't matter. But, pay for it. Do you have mirrors at home? I think you should pay me! You don't have a chance to buy me a drink now, I'm in vacation!

How? Say, have a chat. Even though it's an one night stand, it could be a romantic one. Maybe, you can screw two girls a night, but it could be romantic. I have to pay, you know. Why not start it now? You mena it! Hi, handsome. Hi. Do you need a woman tonight? I want to talk first. No problem. We need... I'll go to Di Da Di Disco tonight. Should you guys want to join me?

I really can't understand that this hotel has ghost! but Why were you naked? Did you really meet a ghost? You could do anything you wish, you already undressed.
