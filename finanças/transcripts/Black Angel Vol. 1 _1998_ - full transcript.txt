Boss, it feels like we're kidnapping her. Don't worry. She's my granddaughter. But your wife... She betrayed me. She knew. If I'd known, I would never have let this child be born. But still... Listen, Yasuda. We'll pretend she never lived. Remember, the baby died. Ange noir (Black Angel) Riona Hazuki Jinnpachi Nezu Kippei Shiina Miyuki Ono Yoshiyuki Yamaguchi Reiko Takashima Don't look at me like that. I don't have them. I saw you were all looking at it. Six years later See? There's nothing here. I don't have them. Don't take the photos. The boss will get mad. Ikko! Give them back to me. No. I mean it. Ikko. Why aren't you in bed? It's my fault. It wasn't Yasu. I was messing about. Go to sleep. I'm sorry. Yasuda really worries too much. Excuse me. She's dad's official wife. She looks old. What did you say? You know these things at my age. Do you now? My mum was his lover. This is my stepsister, Chiaki. She looks like me, right? Not at all. You're far prettier than she is. Ha! That won't get you anywhere. I wouldn't dream of... Is anything wrong? Yasuda ordered these men to protect me tonight. Someone is plotting to kill me. To kill you? The Godfather? Apparently it's someone in the Family. Ridiculous. Who's behind it? No one knows. Too many to count! Relax guys. Have a drink. Come on, give it back. They're just old photos. Who's this? He's handsome. Him? Handsome? Just an arrogant college boy. Too gutless even to get a Yakuza badge, a tattoo. Don't worry, princess. It makes a good alibi to be here. We'll stay until he's dead meat. That's why we pay good money to bad cops. You never know when you need'em. That's right. He made life hell for my mother. He deserves... ...to die. He has to die. Join me in hell. If you ever betray me, I'll kill you. Who is it? Excuse me. We're from next door. We've got a problem. Our fuse has blown. We're not sure how to fix it. Could you help us? Fuse? Sure. Who is it? Ikko... You idiot. Die! You fucking bitch! Godfather... Mummy! Ikko! Run! Get away... You bitch! Forgive me... Yasuda! Don't! Your turn to die! This is O-O-Onda. There's blood all over the place! I was on patrol and heard gunshots. I rushed in... and shot one of them. Send back up. Send back up! Mother, I am working hard to make you happy. Anybody alive in there? Where's the little girl? Ikko, where are you? Not another girl with a gun... Or are you... The Black... ...Angel. Where's the consignment? Did you get a passport? It'll take another 10 hours. Okay. Listen, Ikko. She's on our side. She'll help you escape. Got that? When you grow up... ...there's no need to avenge us. You go with Angel. I don't want to! Yasuda! You've got to. Quickly. Come with us, Yasu! You'll grow into a fine lady. Take care of her. Let's find the kid. Come on. Teach me how to shoot and let's take revenge. I'll work hard and pay you, Angel. Forget about us. Here, take this. Your daddy's friend will be waiting in LA. Off you go. Hang on... Here's something for you. Why aren't you coming? You'll be fine. I'll always be there for you. Take care. We'll meet again some day. OK, off you go now. Are you an Angel? My name is Mayo. - Mayo? - As in mayonnaise. 14 years later Are you Mr Kosugi? No, I'm not. The Kosugi Family! You're Mr Kosugi? Excellent! What's your name? Are you a reporter? Got any speed? What about a gun? Don't fuck with me. What the fuck are you playing at? Get up, bitch! I'm the Black Angel... or something. You bitch. What the fuck happened to you? Where's the boss? Not again! Bad luck, kid. I win again. Mr Kosugi! Maruya's been killed! Some girl and a blonde guy did it. She calls herself The Black Angel, or something. Let's call it a day. Let's go have a drink. Out of my fucking way! Kosugi! Where can I find him? Look! It's Nogi, I'm after. If it isn't Mr Nogi. And is that Narusawa? They both look so young there. This just isn't my fucking day. Shut the fuck up! You bastard! Kosugi! No! I came all the way from America to find Nogi. Tell me all about him and I won't kill you. You know him, don't you! Thank you for dinner. Drive safely. He's pissed as a newt. Out of the car, arsehole. Who the fuck are you? Motherfucker! Nogi! Who else was in the photo? Mr Narusawa... and... I don't remember. You mean Narusawa from the Nogi Gang? That's bullshit. Chiaki incited Nogi to do it. Chiaki, his daughter? We were just low-ranking yobs then. Chiaki made Nogi do it. I don't know if it was sex or love, but they still ain't married! You knew the plot, yet you didn't tell the Don. We only got a small patch for our silence. Nogi and Chiaki got the best territory. We didn't fucking do the job! Come on, I need a piss. Why did they go for the Don's lover and kid, too? The lover's baby was to be the heir of the Family. But Chiaki wanted that for herself. The money was to go to the kid. What was the name...? Ikko. Ikko, a military operation in China in the Second World War Where is she now? She escaped to America. I hear the Mafia got their hands on her. Probably a call girl by now. How do you know? Why me? I go back a long way with the Don. You said we're cutting the dope. Never! Who said that? You're standing in the way of us taking over the bank. You cause trouble. It's not me. I know you lot too well. Well that's the situation anyway. Who's putting you up to this? I'm sorry! It's the East Kanagawa gang. He's leaving. Take care of him. Hey, we've got to stick together, like always. Okay, Boss? Just like old times. Thanks. I appreciate it. It's me. What? Who did it? The police don't know yet. An automatic weapon. A girl? She was showing an old photo of Nogi. The Black Angel. That's what she called herself? They may be after you. Better be... ...careful. They might just get you. No senator, don't. Everyone can see us. < You've reached our> Let them see. No. Then everything is back to the drawing board. No, it can't be. Wait up. Let him listen to this. Oh senator... No. Not that... Hello? It's me. I'm sorry. It could be Ikko, back from America. Ikko? Sounds like her. She'd be around 20 by now. Just 20? Enough talking. Sorry, senator. Damn whore. Ikko is back? He's so frigging heavy. Kasuga. You think she's still alive? Who? The best hotel in Japan? I doubt it. Arty, ain't it? What's this? A Daifuku rice cake. Never tried them in LA? It's good! Delicious! I'm so happy. The Angel saved you? Mayo? You'll find her, I'm sure. That's why I'm here. She'll help us. She's smart, beautiful, she really is fantastic. You quit drugs. But now you're an alcoholic. Has The Angel turned back into a human being? D'you want to work again? The best quality shit. As much as you want. Kill a girl for me. She calls herself The Black Angel. You probably have an idea of who she is. Good morning. Morning. I had a guest. Clean up. Certainly. - Newspaper? - I'll get it. Good morning. I'm in the pool. The senator agreed to get us the permit. I've got a funeral to attend to first. I even have to work at the weekend. I understand. You'll get her soon. No girl is going to scare me. I'm the daughter of a Don. Ikko comes from the same bloodline, you know. Yakuza blood. Are you there? This pool is reserved. You're Chiaki, right? What? I'm Ikko. You said Ikko. You can't be! Can't be! They're here. Where's the pool? That way. You killed my parents. Wait. Are you really Ikko, my stepsister? I searched everywhere for you. Don't move. You killed my parents. Why would I? He was my father too, and you're my sister. How could I do something like that? I was a victim, too. That can't be helped. Even the law says so. I've put aside your share of the inheritance. My mother really missed you when she was alive. She was so sad that you were orphaned. She wanted you to live with us. You liar! I also had a baby. But she died soon after birth. It was around the time when you were born. I always believed you were a reincarnation of my baby. I never ever forgot about you. Stop it. Nogi! No! Don't kill her! Why did you stop me? They wanted to kill you. I don't know. You scared me. Sorry. I made a mistake. Will you still help me? If you kiss me. For you. Wow. I'm happy now. I didn't betray you. Don't go back to LA, stay with me. Let's drink. We'll be all right. I killed them all so that they won't find us here. Is he a Japanese-American gang member from LA? Who are you? Did you kill him? No, Nogi did. You should know that. I know the whole story. Since you were born... No, I actually witnessed the moment you were conceived. You won't remember, of course. It was a rainy night. I heard screams. By the time I reached her the rapist was running away. I wanted to chase him. But she was so beautiful, I couldn't move. So lovely in her school uniform. She was your mother. - But my mum is... - Don't move! I know Nogi's schedule. I'll tell you where he'll be and what he's doing tonight. Listen. Right now he's in Shinjuku. Shut the fuck up! We're talking business here! We can pay three million in protection money. We need five, every month. If you don't agree, we can always fight about it. Tough conditions! Nobody wants a war with you, Mr Nogi. But five per month is too much. It'll be tough. But all right, then. It's a deal. Let's drink to it. Zill, I did it. Just one left. Get up. Get up. You betrayed me! Let me go! A fine fucking shot you are. I let you live. Ungrateful bitch! Wait! That girl is... After revenge, huh? She betrayed me. I'll kill her. That was 14 years ago. What made you come back now? I just turned 20, I'm legally of age to kill, right? Who brought you to Japan? How did you know my schedule? You tiny piece of shit. D'you really think you'll survive this? But you are beautiful, like your mother. You wore a bullet-proof vest. Coward! You call yourself a man? You're bleeding. True Yakuza blood. What you say is right, too. Untie her. Dress her up. Give her a coat. Let me go. Put the vest on her, too. All right. You can go. What are you planning, slime ball? Don't underestimate me. Hey, Ikko. Stroppy bitch! Let her go. Wrong way. Bad luck, kid. Now where're you going? Where are you off to? Had enough yet? Come over here. Kill me first, then you can go. You know, it's not as if we were strangers. My father was a hit man in the Amaoka Family. He died fighting for Don Amaoka when I was a kid. But Amaoka never did shit for me and my mother. When my dad got killed we were completely on our own. Life was very tough. Are you listening to me? - Stop it! - I'm just like you, kid! But when I look into your eyes... ...they remind me of myself seeking revenge back then. Be my woman. How about it? Never! Ikko is in the Central Hospital building. Just kill me. I'm not telling you anything. What the fuck are you doing? Don't jump to any conclusions. I'll still never forgive you. Find them. They've got guns. So watch out. Why did you bring me here? I'm sorry. You might find this inconvenient, but... ...these men died trying to protect you. She didn't shoot me, did she? It's none of my concern. You can't be serious. It will be a blow for the the business if I'm seen here. Your business is successful because we get our hands dirty. Stop kidding yourself. In which case, why didn't you kill her? What did you want with her? Why dope her up? You wanted her for yourself, didn't you? As always. These men died because of your lust. Shut your mouth! You let them escape. What's your game, cop? You're fucking dead! Cut it out! That's enough. Stop it. Right now! There was a woman who helped Ikko escape to America. We searched everywhere for her. Right? Yes, sir. Anyway Ikko will be back to kill me. Next time she shows up, she's dead. I don't want any signs of trouble on this site. I understand. - You fix the cremation. - It's done. You know Mayo? Mayo is his girl, isn't she? Nogi's mistress. Mr Nogi would never betray you. My father hated Nogi. He liked you. I wonder why? My father used to have an eye for a good man. I can't answer that. I'll always do my best for the Don, your father. Let me know. Mayo worked as a killer for your father, he liked her work. Nogi caught her and worked her over. He hooked her on dope and made her his woman. He gave her a bar. I had a daughter... She'd be as old as Ikko if she had lived. I feel sorry for them, but... Could you please kill them... both Mayo and Ikko. It's as if... I met you before, a long time ago. When I was still a child. No, you're mistaken. We first met at your father's funeral. Must be my imagination... They've gone. We're safe now. The style's too old for you, but put it on anyway. They won't be back, for a while at least. I'm freezing. Take a bath. Clean yourself up. Can you imagine what happened to me, thanks to you? You said someone would take care of me in LA. You're no fucking angel! Take a bath. Don't fucking make fun of me! Show me your fucking wings, angel! It's all your fault. You made me like this. - I don't want to live anymore. - Hang in there. You'll pull through. Zill is here to take me. Can't you see him? Zill is here. There's no one here. You'll be all right. Damn you! You old witch! How about we both go away someplace and forget it all. Far, far away... Where no one knows. Where do you want to go? One day In the woods I bumped into A big bear She's taking her time. It's a Yakuza. Police. Hands up! Don't move! Stay there! Don't move. Where have you hidden her? Where's my angel? She brought a breath of fresh air to this sleepy town. After 14 years of monotony. Soon everything will work out just as I planned. I must thank you, too. What for? You really want to know? Drink. I'm high today! Let me tell the world. I finally got the woman I've been waiting for. After all this time, I finally got her! You two are presents for Chiaki, you see. Someone as... talented as me... ...had to clean up those thugs' shit. Mother! Are you listening? It's obvious. You're Nogi's type. Want to be my girl, instead? You would get to live then. It was me... I'm the man... I was supposed to be... Supposed to be Godfather of this city. I... I know... I know every block and street in this town. I know everything! I know what Nogi really wants. I know who is the real mother of Ikko. It was 20 years ago. It was raining. Stop! She was so beautiful, I couldn't move. Exquisitely beautiful. She was still only a kid. She didn't realise what being pregnant really meant, at first. She gave birth to an unwanted baby. Her parents said that it died and kept it quiet. I was the only witness. They paid me to keep quiet. I took care of the police. I did it for her, the victim. I had no hope of promotion, anyway. God will forgive me. So I waited for my chance to be the Don, alongside her. For my mother, too. I've got what it takes. Where is she? It's time to kill her and Nogi. What happened to the baby? This'll surprise you. Now she is... It's a pack of lies. My mother died protecting me! Don't leave me. Still haven't found her? I'm sorry. She's good with a gun, for a girl. The family could use her, if trained. Sometimes a female assassin is useful. "I want her for myself?" Women always say that. No answer. She called us, didn't she? - Right? - That's what I was told. You're all fucking useless. You fucking... Have you killed Chiaki? Boss over here. Anyone! She's here! Up there! Nogi! Damn it. "Join me in hell!" you said. It's all your fault. You always leave me on my own. Chiaki! Where the hell is she? Nogi! Nogi! Nogi! Nogi! Here I am! Show yourself, Nogi! You've caused a right fucking mess, haven't you? A lot of my guys are dead. Get out of here! The city is mine! Nogi! If you don't fucking like it, you can die too! Why did you give birth to me? How could you bring me... into this stinking world? Don't shoot! Ikko's your own... No! It's all wrong!
