(WHISTLES) Thought for sure there'd be another stage coach. Not this time. That's our wagon, all right. Remember, don't hit that dynamite too soon. I can't do it. Can't do what? I can't see the marker. Been in these blazing rocks so long, I can't see. (HORSES NEIGHING) (GUNS FIRING) Briggs? Schroeder? Ramsay? They got Ramsay. I've seen it. Check the others. They can't all be dead. I'm afraid they got Schroeder, too. Jamie, go get the mules. Look over the blue coach. There's only four boxes of gold. Get that gold on the pack mules. Major, over here, quick! He's alive. I didn't shoot him. Just shot the gun out of his hand. What do we do? I don't know. We can't take prisoners, we've got no medicine. We'll need water and food to make him comfortable... Their horses are still around. I'd like to make it back to Carson City. Put that away. Help me get him against that rock. Cass, you and Egan get the gold out of that wagon, quick. Captain, we're Confederate soldiers. On special duty from the Army of Northern Virginia. Better keep me alive, Reb. You're going to need me. Need you? Why? Well, what's he trying... I thought you might want this. Thanks Egan. What were you trying to tell us? The war is over. You got licked, Reb. You're lying. Lee would never give up. Over a month ago. Lee surrend... You better keep me alive. He was lying. Just trying to keep us here. He was lying, that's all. Maybe. We'll keep our meeting with Captain Peterson. We'll know the truth then. They told me you had been under fire. I was. Five and half days. And you never killed a man. I don't know. No, sir. I want you with us when we get home. You won't be... MAN: Hey, Matt! We're here. Somewhere between here and the Texas border, you're going to have to grow up. Major! Just about given you up. You're in sight for sore eyes, Major. All of you. Everything came off all right, didn't it? We lost three men. We got the gold over a quarter million dollars worth. Well... It would be worth 3,000 men to the Confederacy... We can... How long have you been here? Here? Right here? - Right here. - Too long Major. Now let's get that gold into the medicine wagon and you fellas dust outta here. Time's your problem now. Where were you before you came up here? Why? What's the trouble, Major? Not sure. Where were you? I was movin' around. Gettin' known. Virginia said it was my last stop three weeks ago. Why? Then I will have to tell you. The gold isn't worth even six men to the Confederacy. There isn't any Confederacy. I wanted to ride out and warn you, but it was too late. I was sure it was too late. If I'd have left here, I'd have missed you for sure. I wasn't gonna take it for myself. I was... We've heard enough. You knew where we planned to attack. You had time to come out and stop it. - To save the lives of over a dozen... - (GUN FIRES) Don't ever try that again. What did you say? The war is over. There's no army, no rank. Don't ever use your hands on me again. Listen to me, all of you. The war is not over for us. Those dead men back there were Nevada volunteers. This whole territory will be swarming with posses. Men, home from the war, and they're not going to believe a word we tell them. We needed Petersen, but he's dead. Till we get outta here, someone's gotta give orders. So if we're gonna have trouble from you, let's have it now. Fine. We have to let these horses blow. We'll camp here till nightfall. I guess I lost my head, Matt. What's happened to you? Is it that easy to kill a man? Well, isn't it? What else have we been doing for the past five years? Petersen had it coming. Is that all it takes? You've changed. A lot more than you think. Well, you haven't. You've known me for 10 years and you never stopped trying to cut me down to your size. Take care of your horse. I'll take over, Cass. Coffee's still hot. Coffee? I ain't been thinking about coffee, boy. Thank you. That razor's not as sharp as it was, but it's yours. Well... Whiskers just grow right back in the end. Well, we've buried the Confederacy. We've talked about everything but what's really on our mind. Anybody talked about that yet? About what, Cass? If you don't know, you ain't human. The gold? You're human. What do you think we should do? Well, it ain't as if we stole it. It came into our hands as part of the war. For me... I am to take a share home with me. Anybody got a better suggestion? Egan, how do you feel about it? It'd be hard to see wrong in keeping it, when a few hours ago there was no wrong in killing for it. What else was there to do? Give it back to the rotten Union government? They'd probably hang us for thanks. Maybe. We'd probably get strung up for thieves in any case. Is that what you wanna do? To give that stuff back? That's what won the war, not courage or being in the right. Just gold. If the Union wants it back, they'll have to fight us for it. Keeping it for ourselves is something else. If the South is still there maybe she could use it. Not my share, Major. If the war's over, it's over and there ain't nothing that... Coming home, dear Bessie. This time, for good. No more wandering off, I promise you. I'll even go to church with you this Sunday, like you always wanted. We'll ride up high. All the folks will look at you like it was the Queen of the May. - Why, you'll be wearing... - I've heard all that I can take. (GUNS FIRING) Another posse. Drop those flaps. Whoa! (GUNS FIRING) If I tap on the canvas come out shooting. (MEN LAUGHING) Morning, Gentlemen! Morning! Got you anything to drink in that cart, doc? Sure thing. Yeah, has that hogwash got any alkey in it? Open up, Doc. Customers. Why don't you give a good doctor a chance to answer some of them questions? I just borrowed this, Doc. I lost my sombrero this morning. (MEN LAUGHING) You'll buy it. It'll cost you five dollars. Hey, he's got a price for everything, ain't he? You are Doc Collins, ain't you? That I am, sir. Who are you? We're deputies, friend. Deputized fresh this morning. And we're gonna look you over. Help yourself, help yourself. Give me a hand, Smitty. You wouldn't be after the gang that held up that gold shipment? How'd you know about that, friend? Why, you're got to miss the hanging. They were bringing them in when I came through Salt Flats. - Yo-hoo! - Whoa! Come on! Let's get outta here. - That was too close. - Yeah. Major, what would have happened if they looked in the back? We'll have some rope to go with that if we don't think fast. They'll be back looking for this wagon. Hey! (URGING HORSE) All right. Pull 'em up. Whoa! Wrong coach boys, all I got is people. You got some more people now. How many in there? Two. Man and a woman. And one of them is very pretty. Traveling alone, Miss? She's my fiancee. Jamie, get between them. I reckon who you are now. And I don't like it. You don't have to like it yea-hoo. MATT: Did he have a gun? I was just fixin' to look. (CHUCKLES MOCKINGLY) You got one too, Miss? Search her. Looks like army. Union army. She was a nurse. Doesn't she ever talk? Get on with it. Well, she doesn't have a gun. Come on. Use that whip. (GUN FIRING) Ha! Hey! (URGING HORSES) Whoa! Drop them! Inside! Why drag us into this? At least let her go! (GUNS FIRING) Careful over there. Come on, you over here. You two, come on, over here! Jamie! Close that door! Heya, coming aback! Go on. And somebody get that coach? Miss, he's got a bullet in him. How many out there? Five, I think. Let's see if I can make it four. If we have to kill to get out of here, we'll do it. But I'll tell you when. Check that back room. How bad is it? I can get the bullet out, but not here on the floor. Oh, I'm not hurt. I was just scared. Sure, you scare easily. Whoa! Hey, Quincey! Major! You might have killed him, you knot head. Huh... You mean I didn't? Well, you better hope that he's still alive. That I get a chance to talk to him. Then you can do with him as you want to. MATT: Hey, out there! Get him into the shed there. Pour some water on him. We're listening. We've got two coach passengers in here. Give us our man and we'll turn 'em loose. All right, turn them loose. Bring the man out. Where I can see him. (LAUGHS) Now listen who's giving the orders. Man, we don't have to make no deal. You can stay holed up until judgment day. We can wait. Finish tying 'em. I've got a bad shoulder, son. If you want my hands back of me like hers you'll have to break a couple of bones first. What did they do with Cass? Kill him? I don't know. How many out there? Three maybe four they're up in the rocks. The bleeding stopped. I'll need something to probe with. Will you get it? Or shall I? Go ahead. - I want to tell you... - I don't want any thanks. I wouldn't help if I had a choice. A nurse doesn't have one. I'm afraid I'll live. Good, we may need you. You'll find the scissors in the right side of that cupboard. MATT: I'll take the gun. What were you planning to do with this against four of us? We'll be gone before midnight and while we are here there's no harm intended toward any of you. Try to remember that. Seen anybody ride away back the way we came, Jamie? Nobody has rode off any direction. I think they smell gold, Jamie. I'll need some help. MATT: There's a man in there. He'll help you. (LAUGHING) You want me to douse him again? Well, don't drown him, we got plenty of... MATT: All right, you win. You ready to come out? We are ready to give you the gold. Isn't that what your after? You got it with ya? We are not that crazy we left it back there. Over a quarter million. Let us go and it's all yours. We left it practically on top of the ground. Let us send back for it or it won't be there. It won't be where? Make us a deal. All right. You tell us where it's at and there won't be nothing left of us but a cloud of dust. Now you know that. Oh, no, I don't. Then there's nothing we can do about it. You either take that gamble or you don't, one. That's up to you. Well, you taking that chance? MATT: All right, I'll take it. Did you find the wagon? Sure did, and drank some of that good elixir. (CHUCKLES) Take 30 paces from the front of the wagon. And turn right, 20 more. The gold's there with some sand tossed over it. We can go now, huh, Reb? I didn't expect you to take my word for it. Send a man to look. He can be back by morning. Sure we'll do just that. Here's the bullet. He'll be whistling that song again soon enough. And tell me, what happens when the man they send comes back with the bad news? (GUNS FIRING) MAN: We're still here, all of us. And we are staying. Does it surprise you to find people who aren't like you? They are doing just what I counted on. But what are we like? Go on, tell us. She can't and neither can I. What is a man like who would shoot down a dozen men? What men? What men? Nevada volunteers. The gold train convoy. How many dead? MAN: Every last one. (SOBS) OLD MAN: Margaret, maybe he... He might have, uh... Your son? Her's. My grandson. - Might make you feel better... - Get away from me! I want you to hear this. If your son is dead it's because he was a soldier. If he was killed, it was by another soldier. Eight of us came up here to Nevada six weeks ago. The war was still going on then. We had been ordered to attack a convoyed gold shipment. We carried out those orders. Over a dozen men were killed. Union and Confederate soldiers. It wasn't till afterward that we learned that... That the war had ended. Now that's a tall one. And being good, honest soldiers you left the gold and reported yourselves to the nearest Union army post. No, we decided to go home. And take the gold with us. I wanted to tell you what happened because I thought it might help you. Nevada is full of you Confederate deserters and your lying excuses for being what you are. OLD MAN: Margaret, please. Don't say no more. My son wasn't the first. You killed my husband too. At Gettysburg. Don't pay her no mind. Get the fire going now, that cool oil! Hey, what happened to Maxwell? I don't know. Maxwell! Maxwell! Somebody calling me? Come here! Boys let's get this straight. Nobody is leaving here. Now go get the rest of them horses and bring them right over here. From now on that's where they stay, all of them. And when we do leave here. We're all leaving together. He talks pretty big, don't he? You think maybe that Reb was telling the truth? All that gold lying back there? Just waiting for some prune picker to stumble over? Maybe? I wouldn't try riding off to find out if I were you. Who said anything about riding off? I did. (CASS GROANING) - Hey, Quince! - Yeah? Come on, you're awake. Wait a minute don't kick a man when he's down it ain't sporting. Besides he's going to answer some questions. Nice and straight. Now start with the gold. Where is it at? I said where's the gold? I don't remember, I'm all fogged up. It's in the house there, ain't it? No. No, we left it behind. Where? I don't know. I can't think. Ah, it's no use he's passed out again. Molly? You know why I told them that, don't you? That we were... That I was your fiancee? Thought it would be safer for you that way. Maybe I was trying to push you into making up your mind. The right way. All right, Jamie, let's try it again. Rolph, go ahead. MAN 1: Wrong again! Wasn't nobody there! MAN 2: We ain't in no hurry. MAN 3: We are going to wait for you to come out. The moon will be down in a few minutes. Can that rear door be opened without too much noise? Oh, it's been quiet enough to suit me. I don't want to put gags in your mouths. I won't, if you give me your words you'll be quiet. You can have our word. My daughter doesn't mind. You speak for yourself. Anything I can do to see you southern butchers killed, I'll do it. Jamie, come over here. Come on, you leave that one to Puss, belle. Take a good look at the southern butcher, ma'am. He's never killed in his life. But he watched Sherman's men burn his farm to the ground and kill his whole family. - He hid in a cane break and saw his own... - Don't, Egan! Leave her alone. I spoke my peace. Start getting ready. A gag isn't a very pleasant thing, ma'am. If you have to go out weighted down like mules you won't get far. You can have my word, to keep silent. We plan to avoid 'em, ma'am. Not outrun 'em. Do I have your word? You have it. I'll give you my word because I believe you. Thanks. You still don't know the war is over. None of you know what it means or you would have left that gold behind. Oh, stop it, Molly! They've known it was over since the day it ended. We're going now, ma'am. I wish there was something I could... What the major told you was true. You've got to believe that, ma'am. Jamie. Well... Goodbye. We'll get to the horses in the corral. Hey! They're going out the back way! The back way! (GUNS FIRING) Inside! We ain't as soft horn as you thought are we? We'll take care of him later. I'll count on that. Cover that window. He's hurt bad. We wanna get on home. You come out with your hands up and we'll take you to the sheriff in Carson City. Yeah! In boxes! What you wanna say that for? Well, any cactus head would know they ain't coming out of there until we go in and get em. You think so, huh? I know so. I've seen a nice fat hay rope up over in that corral, how'd you like to go in and get it? Has he got a chance? I don't know. We can keep him warm. Hot compresses may keep the infection down. But I can't get the bullets out. If he dies, there sits the reason. What are you planning to do about it? I didn't believe you and I still don't. I did what I thought was right. Bring those rags here. Gag him! (GROANING) You ought to be grateful I don't kill him. He gave his word and broke it. Do you like him for it? Yes! I hope you mean it, you've got to live with him. Somebody's got to be in there with Egan. She'll be in there. Hey, Reb. We got a friend of yours out here. Have a look! Did you ever see a hangman's knot before? Well, have a good look! You got about half a minute to come out. Your boy here says you didn't know the war was over. Well here's your chance to come out and prove it! Got 20 seconds. Then I'm gonna butt that horse. Stay in there! MATT: Wait! Give us a half minute to talk it over. All right. Any dynamite left in your pouch? One or two sticks. When I throw the first one cover me. (INDISTINCT SHOUTING) (GUNS FIRING) (FIRING CONTINUES) (SIGHS) Told you we should have burned them out in the first place. Yeah, I guess you were right. It's smarter if you do it my way. I've been in that station, I know what I'm talking about. Here. Hey! I was hoping there would be some of them around here. Well... I thought we'd give 'em to them. Well, go ahead! Can't you tell when a man is joking, boy? After you get cleaned up. You and Jamie get some sleep. You can relieve Rolph and me in a couple of hours. Yes, sir. I guess I don't have to tell you that them ain't deputies out there. Just a bunch of drifters. Do they... Do they know the gold's in here? You got 'em confused. If they ever find out though and get their hands on it, there ain't gonna be nobody left alive in here to tell. You got any plans? Mmm-hmm. We go out shooting, sometime tomorrow. Wish I hadn't asked. We'll tunnel under here. No! It's gotta be quiet. Can I get you something? Coffee? - Something to eat? - It ain't no use son. There ain't nothing you nor anybody else can do for her. - Well, I thought maybe... - I know how you feel. But this ain't anything to do with Murphy. When her man was killed her boy joined up. He never come home again. And she made herself old and miserable and sick with hating ever since. I've learned to leave her be. But she still gotta eat and so do you. It'd be simpler if you just let me fix it, son. You know you don't look much like a cook to me. - Well, I don't know but... - Look, son, that story your major tells is pretty hard to get down. But I reckon you've got your right to try and prove it, which you won't get from that gang of cut backs out there. So last night I decided to be neutral in this hegboo. Meantime, I'm powerful hungry. Well I'd like to untie you, but... MATT: Untie him, Jamie. Well, I'm much obliged to ya. Don't mention it. You didn't ask for my word. Didn't I? Well you've got it! And if you want proof? I keep a gun right beneath this table. And I could have got it anytime last night. You mean this one? Buckwheats and coffee on the way. Jamie, ungag him and give him some water. I'd like to let you free, too. But it's up to you. I'll stay as I am. He's out of his head. (MOANING) Jamie. They've got enough wood out there to light us up every night for a month. That means we have to leave in broad daylight which might as well be today. The longer we're here, the more danger to them. We'll start out this rear door to draw them away from the front. Then cut back inside and go out that door. If we could take that shed, we'll have a chance. Their horses are behind it. Sounds like sure death to me. Probably. Is there any other way? All right, that's it. We'll eat, wait an hour and then go. Get your guns ready. Jamie. Give our friend here a fresh gag. (WHISPERING) Wait a minute. I wanna talk to you. As long as you are here you will be kept gagged and tied. But it's got nothing to do with that. This is important for you. Calm down, she's asleep. What's on your mind? You're planning to shoot your way out of here sometime today. But if you do, your lives won't be worth a Confederate dollar. Hey, watch your talk there, boy. You'll give us a better way for a price? That's right. How much would two of those bars weigh? About 50 pounds. That's over 20,000 dollars. See my coat over there. It's got two inside pockets, put one bar in each pocket. And when I leave here. No one has to know there's anything in it. No one at all. If you can show us a way to get out of here alive you'll get your price. No one's to know. Now or later. You have our word now hurry it up. Untie my hands I have something to give you. What? In my pocket. I'm a beef contractor. I know this country like a book. There's a tribe of Paiute Indians in these hills not ten miles from here. Their chief gave me that. Now you show that to him. Tell him you've come from Lee Kemper... The Indians were hostile during the war. How were you so friendly? Well, my job was to buy beef. The army didn't ask where I got it and I didn't ask the Indians. Give him that and you'll get horses and a guide and all the food and water you'll need. You'll be in Texas before you know it. What's the matter? We're in here, a dozen cut throats out there. You're just wasting our time. Oh, I'm not through yet. Sometime today or tonight, this pass will be hit by a flash storm. Rain so thick you can't see 10 feet. Does that interest you? I was told this is a dry season. It is. Rain will only last about 10 minutes. Look out that window. Those clouds only mean one thing to a Nevadan. Ask the old man there, he'll tell you I'm right. What's the matter? Something bothering you? Here's when you get a dose of your own Yankee medicine. Miss. Why don't you ask your friend here what's in his coat over there? Rolph! What does he mean? That's what I'd like to know. Now he's just trying to start something. Just a minute. There's some gold in that coat I had it put there. Why? To carry it, I plan to take the coat. Is this true Lee? I suppose so, how should I know? What did you do for it, Lee? Are you gonna let this crazy fool... (LAUGHS) Molly! Molly, listen to me! You didn't change. I just never knew you. He had it coming. Yes, he said that about Petersen, too. Listen, I made my deal with you and it's up to you... Bring that up again. Tell her he was lying and make this crazy fool back you up. Did you come in here to salvage a bargain? Yes, that's about it. I owed it to him. He gave us back our lives. He also got over 20,000 dollars. Most women would be happy with a windfall like that. Your southern ladies? I shouldn't have said that, I'm sorry. Please go now. You've made your effort. It's not your fault it didn't succeed. I'm afraid I'm not even sorry. Maybe it will turn out we did you quite a kind of favor bringing the two of you in here. You've done nothing for me at all. You never retreat an inch, do you? Yes, whenever I'm wrong. - I hadn't any plans to... - (MUMBLES) (MOANING) (SIGHS) Good, good. Take it real slow now or they'll hear for sure. A little early, ain't you. I couldn't sleep. I'll take over. How is he? If he pulls through it will be your doing. (MOANS) Don't come near me. I only want to talk to you. I never done you any harm. Why are you afraid of me? We're not outlaws, we're soldiers. I was an officer. I want to talk to you, ma'am, and I intend doing it. Nobody's going to hurt you. Just hold quiet. No one's gonna do you any harm. (SHRIEKS) (GRUNTING) (GROANS) (PANTING) I've had enough. (CLATTERING) (GROANING) If there's anything more from you, I'll kill you. You understand? I'll kill you. Cass, give him his gun back. He ought to have it took away from him. Why I think he'd just leave, shoot you in the back, and spit. (PANTING) Give it to him. You and Jamie, take your two hours. Cover that window. (EGAN GROANS) I've spent the past couple of hours, trying to figure how to tell you why we... I'm all right. You've no need to apologize. Apology was for myself, not Rolph. You were a soldier. You had every right to try to get home alive. (GUNS FIRING) (GASPING) Major... Maybe I'd better learn to knock... Come in, Cass. Who'd you like to try next, Jamie? Major! We're gonna need his gun to get out of here. Get out! (GUN FIRES) Leave it alone, Rolph. Drop it Rolph, drop it. He tried to kill you. Look out! (THUDDING) You took a big chance there. Well... When I had that noose around my neck out there I started to give myself up for dead. (CHUCKLES) Guess I ain't over it yet. We're gonna burn 'em out. Start throwing that wood. That ought to hold it down. Where's that storm we paid you for? I've been wondering when they'd get around to that. Jamie, get some buckets. I'll get you some. I just concluded not to be neutral. If its all right with you. Fine with me. Jamie, help me with this. Got to get rid of some of this gold. If they don't find it, you'll be safe. Don't worry, nobody's going to get their hands on it. It's going back where it come from. Cass, untie them. You so much as bat an eye I'll shoot it right out of your head. Come on, get over there. You can't stay over here, ma'am. You gotta get over there by the door. Look out, Major. He's dead. Aren't you going to let us out of here? If it's possible to stay it out, we're going to. Otherwise I'll get you out in plenty of time, all of you. Well, at least untie my hands. Cass, help me with Egan. Don't shoot, they were holding me in there. All right, we go now. Out the back window. Wait, we got to scatter their horses first or we won't have a chance. You won't have a chance of doing that either. Come on, get ready. (THUNDER RUMBLES) We'll be gone in a minute. I don't want this to end here. But it will. No matter how you got that gold, if you take it with you you're an outlaw. I know that, but I intend to get it home. Then I'm coming north to find you. Then don't take it. Don't go on fighting a war that's already over. Where will I find you? You'd better go. These storms last only a few minutes. - You've got to... - JAMIE: Major... Cass, he's gone. (THUNDER RUMBLING) (HORSES GRUNTING) Over there. Get going. (THUNDER RUMBLES) Check that room in there. All right, where is it? If you mean gold, they didn't have none with 'em. Fletch, who's over there? Fletch? Hey, Smitty. Smitty? Take it easy. I'm over here. Where are you guys? Quince! Let's go. Maybe we won't have to. Nothing in there. You was in that coach, wasn't you? Yes, I was. And where is the gold? Probably right where they said it was. They didn't have it with them. She's telling the truth. Let's go. All right, let's go. How many you got left? You heard me. Where'd the rest of you go? Take a look. Come on, you can take us. There must be three of you left. Maybe four. Let's go or they'll get that gold before us. They must've been telling the truth. Quince, hey Quincey? Shut up. You want everybody after that gold? Hey, Quincey? Come on. You dirty double cross! (GUN FIRES) (THUNDER CLAPPING) Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, boy. Whoa, boy. Whoa! Molly. Hurry up, pa, they might come back. I guess you're right, Molly. The war is over. They're coach horses son, we got no saddles. Don't need one. You'll find two more gold bags over there, better put them with the rest. Uh, now that you ain't a rich man no more, maybe you'd consider coming back this way. Coming back? Nobody knows you here. You could come back in a few months. And the land's good, over 300 acres of it. Well, I... I'd share it with you. And there's some mighty good hunting, too. If you'd like to come back, you'd be welcome, son. (SOBS) I'm obliged to you, ma'am. I'd like to come back. Don't worry about us, Molly, this Indian token is our passage home.
