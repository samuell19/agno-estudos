[dramatic music playing] Here at Central Command Headquarters in El Manamah, Bahrain, Naval intelligence maintains a watchful eye on a recent military coup, which toppled the Muslim government in Iran one week ago. Now attention is focused on a new development. An American scientist, John Van Tassel was abducted by a team of masked gunmen in Basra, Iraq less than 20 miles from the Iranian border. Van Tassel, a chemical weapons expert, was part of a UN peacekeeping force inspecting Iraqi military installations for possible weapons violations. It is feared the Iranians may have taken Van Tassel in an effort to advance their own chemical weapons technology. The president is reportedly deeply concerned by this act of aggression against an American citizen and has vowed to use all means necessary to secure Van Tassel's release. I'm Mack Nichol, GNN News at US Naval Forces Central Command Headquarters, El Manamah, Bahrain. Clear. Clear. Clear. Ah ha. Tucker? Tuck, you OK? What do we got? Ah. ah. What have we got, Mack? Come on, talk to me, buddy. Tucker? Abort. Abort the exercise. We have an injury. Abort. Abort the exercise, we have an injury. Tuck. Medic! We gotta get him out of here now. He can't continue the exercise. Doc says it's acute appendicitis. They're rushing him to the hospital right now. Gentlemen, we've got to find ourselves a new team member. We've got a SEAL team training in Coronado for the rescue operation. Team 2, the Steel Sharks. They ought to be ready in 48 hours. That might be too late. This man is a walking encyclopedia of information on chemical and biological weapons. The UN uses him because he knows just about every technique in the manufacture of the stuff. You can assure the Joint Chiefs that any information that Van Tassel has generated will be destroyed. Where will you base? We will run the op from the command center on the Coral Sea. The carrier will be in the Arabian Sea in 18 hours. About the request for CIA cooperation, we'd like to use their eye in the sky satellite to coordinate the rescue effort. You have approval. This op will be very touchy politically if it succeeds, even more if it fails. You understand? Yes, sir. I can assure you I will be hands on on this one. I got some news. I made it through. There were times I didn't think I would. Hell week almost got me, but I did it. I graduated, made the teams, passed the six month probation, now I'm just waiting around for that first big chance. Seems so strange. Next week I'll be older than you. By the time you were my age, married to mom, had me, had a life. I don't have any of that. Not yet. Been too busy. I'll be 25. You never had a chance to be 25. Maybe that's what scares me. Then you've always protected me. Bob Rogers? Yes, sir. Dave Zamborski, SEAL Team 2. Come on. See you next Sunday, Dad. Sir, may I ask what's up? You graduated the top of your class and your current team recommended you. They feel you're ready. Communications and electronics, right? Yes, sir. We're mining an operation in the Persian Gulf. Come on. Transports waiting to take us out to a carrier. [music playing] Sir, the men are on board ready for their final briefing. The latest Intel reports. RADIO DISPATCHER: Valley Forge, this is the Coral Sea, immediate execute protocol [inaudible] niner zero, over. Attention on deck. At ease, gentlemen. Gentlemen, Admiral Perry is here for our final briefing. The latest intelligence reports from CIA and satellite recon photos show that Van Tassel is being held in this building on the Gulf Coast. He could be forced to participate in their chemical weapons program. Diplomacy seems to have failed. They deny that he's even being held. We will be monitoring the entire operation by satellite from this room. Excuse me, sir, will you be in radio contact with us? Drop a dish on the beach, and we'll give you the big picture from here. Anything to add? Excuse me, sir. Boss? The F and G? New guy's Bob Rogers. He'll be replacing Tucker. I'm giving him to Mack. You men have run this thing a couple of times in the mockup. What problems do you anticipate? As you can see, we can confirm there's one way in with the exception of the second story windows. It creates a problem for our escape route. Mattox, sir. Team sniper. The surrounding buildings here and here create a pair of blind spots. Well, we have satellite, so we can warn you of approaching troops. From either area, I won't have a clear shot at all. Noted. We'll have the helo drop you on the sub at 1800 hours. I want you in and out and back with your man without anybody knowing that you were there. Return to the sub at 0600 hours for extraction. If you require emergency extraction, the code word is Switchblade. Any questions? Gentlemen, we've got 20 minutes to pack our gear. Let's get to it. Let's do it. Good luck, gentlemen. What you got there? It's nothing. It's just a lucky piece. Look like $0.50 to me. My dad gave me that when I was a kid. Was that all the old man could afford to give you was a $0.50 piece? He was killed in Nam. Give me that the same year. Don't let Cord's rough exterior fool you. Underneath it all, he's even worse. Kappy here is our linguistics expert. Knows how to order beer in 100 different languages. German. [speaking german] [inaudible] loving you. Oh, yeah. You have kids? Yeah. All five of them, well, we think. Don't listen to this asshole. You see, old Mattox here, he didn't join the team for fun. He plans on quitting the team someday, getting out, going on welfare, and becoming a very wealthy man, right? Don't you boys feel left out because I got plans for you in my retirement fund. Gentlemen, 10 minute warning. Finish packing up your gear. Our ride's waiting on deck. RADIO DISPATCHER: Your ride's at 8 o'clock. Coming around. Roger that. RADIO DISPATCHER: Coming in on final run. Get ready. Coming in on final. RADIO DISPATCHER: Final approach. Open the doors. Door. Kit bundle. Prepare to [inaudible]. Make all preparations to dive. Dive the boat [inaudible]. Dive. Dive. [throat clearing] Come on in, Ski. You son-of-a-bitch. Gentlemen, I'd like to introduce you to the second dumbest man who ever joined the Navy. I'd just come back from a tour in Nam. We found we had a lot in common, didn't we? So I began to encourage Ski to think about joining the United States Navy. I talked to you about it every day, didn't I? Twice a day. Twice a day. I'm tenacious. And before he knew it, he became a lifer, just like me. Welcome aboard, Lieutenant Commander. Thank you, sir. You're welcome. Welcome aboard, sir. My men are interested in the ETA for our insertion point. Dobbins? Mr. Pleshe. 0200 hours at current speed, sir. Thank you. Now you go relax, leave the driving to us. Thanks, McKay. What's wrong, Kappy? You a little claustrophobic? Hey, I just don't like tight spaces. Jumping out of planes, you know? Oh, I know. Relax, gentlemen. Approximate ETA for insertion is two hours. Insertion in two hours, sir? You got it. I love when you talk dirty to me. Excuse me, sir. Permission to speak with you? I'm just feeling-- Rogers, you were part of the top 10 that made the grade. You wouldn't be here if you weren't the best. It's just that I've never seen this kind of action, sir. A little fear is a good thing. It opens up your senses. Keeps you alive. So the thing to do is to use it, make it work for you. Yes, sir. All right, gentlemen, let's go over the drill one more time. Sir, we're coming up on the Strait of Hormuz. They have two subs on patrol here, both are Russian diesels, kilo class. They run very quiet on batteries, so we must keep our noise at a minimum. Set conditions QS2. Set condition QS2, aye, sir. Hey. Yes, sir? What do you got for me? Nothing yet, sir. Let me know as soon as you do. Sir? Yes, Hickey? The Oakland will be entering the Straits of Hormuz in just a few minutes. Any sign of activity? Last Intel report has one Iranian sub leaving [inaudible]. The other was last seen along the [inaudible] Coast. What about their patrol craft. Most of their cigarette boats are in the Fourth Naval District. You know, this is the hardest part. Waiting. You plan the mission, rehearse it a dozen times, look at all the possible places where it can go wrong, but you still can't figure out the variables. It's like anything else in life, you really don't know what's going to happen next. Sir, they're about to enter the Straits. Con sonar. Contact, Diesel one, snorkeling at bearing 060 heading right towards us, sir. General quarters, sir? No. We'll run along the west [inaudible] Ridge next to the ON fracture zone, right into the Strait. Chart the course. Take us down 1,000 feet. Dive officer, make your depth 1,000 feet, 20 degree down angle. 20 degrees down angle. We'll dive on fairweather planes. 995. 996. 997. 998. 999. 1,000. Sir, my depth is 1,000 feet. Very well. XO, bring it to a stop. All stop. What have you got, son? Moving away, sir. There's two of them in these waters. No sign of the other one, sir. He's out there. He's not snorkeling. He's on batteries. They can't last long like that. Keep your ears open. Sir. Give it a minute, Dobbins. Con, sonar, contact Diesel 2. He's right next to us, bearing 065, range less than 300 feet. He's ascending, sir. He's starting his diesels now. They'll never hear us. Good. Take us to the Straits. Straits of Hormuz, aye, sir. Ahead 130. OK, gentlemen, showtime. We reach insertion release in 10 seconds on the mark. All stop. Set at periscope depth. Mark. All stop. Make your depth 65 feet. XO, take the Con. XO has the Com. Here we go. Up. All right, Mack. We'll see you on the surface. OK, we'll see you too. Hatch. Flooding. Hey, old man, I just wanted to see you off. Just be here when we get back. Not a problem. When we get back to San Diego, let's take the wives out to dinner. It's a deal. You're buying, right? I got food stamps. You ain't changed, you bastard. Carry on. Have a good mission. Right. Ready, Dave? ROGERS: Alpha Eight Romeo, this is Tango Five Bravo. Beach secure, moving in. Alpha Eight Romeo, over. Sir, the eye in the sky will be over Sector 5 for 16 minutes starting in 10, 9, 8-- Coms are go. Let me know when we have confirmed sat com link. 3, 2, 1. Link confirmed, sir. Tango Five, you're up on screen. Code is green. Code is green. BOB ROGERS: Alpha Eight Romeo, this is Tango Five. Green confirmed. Captain, we've gone green with Operation Switchblade. Put the birds at Ready 5. Flight orders, flight orders. All hands man your flight order stations. The smoking lens is out throughout the ship. The team is in position. Alpha Eight Romeo approaching target area. So far clear. Go to plus 30%. Aye, sir. Going to plus 30. Movement in Sector 5. Looks like 5 unknowns. Looks like they'll run into each other. Plot bearings of unknowns and relate to Tango Five Bravo. Aye, aye, sir. Tango Five Bravo, five unknowns entering your sector at 11 o'clock. DAVE ZAMBORSKI: One split off and take them out. BOB ROGERS: Roger that. I've got him. [grunting] DAVE ZAMBORSKI: Hostiles clearing. Let's move out. Four unknowns leaving the area. We lose eye com in 10 minutes. Highlander in position. The street is clear. Position is clear. 1, 2, 3. [indistinct chatter] [non-english speech] I don't know what you want. I-- I'm, I'm just a civilian working for the UN. I'm making sure baby food factories make baby food. [non-english speech] Yo, Boss. Oh. No, no, don't worry. We're here to protect you. We're Navy SEALs. This is important, did you tell them anything? No. Are you sure? Nothing. Can you walk? I don't know. All right, give him a hand, Cord. Highlander? Street's clear. I can't see the blind spots though. You be careful. Tell Command we're moving out. Alpha Eight Romeo, Tango Five Bravo, bird in hand, leaving cage now. Over. Home base, roger out. The The Oakland that the bird is in hand and the cage is being opened. Aye, sir. Oakland-- Let's go. Bird is in hand-- Sir, Valley Forge reports small craft in water near insertion point. Hm. Well, that's going to complicate things. Send the Valley Forge in to investigate. Well, gents, our boys are on the way back home with the prize. Dobbins, prepare for extraction. Aye, sir. Preparing for extraction. Rog, get him. [beeping] Damn. Unknowns bearing 075. Alert Tango Five Bravo. Aye, sir. We lose eye com in two minutes. Captain, turn the ship into the wind and prepare to launch aircraft. Lieutenant, they're heading for the main team. Got to take them out. Cord. Kappy. Mack, let's go! Reload! Go, go. [non-english speech] Eat this! Reload. Reloading. I'm out. Reload. Moving! Mack, move out! Kappy, go! You're covered. Moving. Reload. Reload. Boss, we got to go now! Reload. Rogers, move out. Moving! Go, go, go. Move it. Move it. Mattox, move out! Contact left. DAVE ZAMBORSKI: Alpha Eight Romeo, we're under heavy fire. This is Tango Five Bravo requesting immediate extraction. Prepare for emergency extraction. Condition is red. DAVE ZAMBORSKI: We got more tangos coming down the loading dock. Captain, condition is red. Have the Tomcats and the Hornets stand by. Do you have Helo Five or pad three ready? Good. Launch the birds. We lose satellite contact in 73 seconds. Reload! [inaudible] Damn. Reloading! Reload. Reload. Reload. [non-english speech] 42, 41, 40, 39-- Oakland, this is [inaudible] Eight. [inaudible] are on their way with emergency extraction. Yes, sir. Roger that. Dobbins, prepare to surface. [inaudible],, 20 degree up angle on fairweather planes. Light them up, Rogers! Time to go, people. Move out. Con sonar. I have sonar contact of a third Diesel, designated Sierra 3. I repeat, Sierra 3, surfacing at bearing 247 degrees, range 600 yards. Sounds like a Russian Kilo class, sir. Maintain current depth, XO. Aye, sir. Montero, began TMA. Aye, aye, sir. Set general quarters. Aye, sir. General quarters. [non-english speech] 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Dark. Sir, Valley Forge reports a new sonar contact bearing 340. Sounds like a Kilo class. I thought both their subs were identified and located. I repeat, this is a new contact. Lieutenant, get me the latest Intel reports. Sir? All stations report manned and ready. Looks like they finally come around to buying themselves a third sub. Flood tubes one and two and prepare to fire? We'll wait and see what happens. Rogers! Go. Move it. Alpha Eight Romeo, we're under heavy fire. [gunshots] Mr. Gregorov, I've just received a land radio transmission. There seems to be a terrorist assault team fighting on shore. Bearing 270 relative. There was no report of air traffic. Your opinion, Mr. Gregorov. That far from your waters, no air traffic, the logical conclusion, they were inserted by sea. But we have been monitoring all service craft. If you already noticed where your patrol vessels and a few small fishing boats. Maybe, submarines. Interesting. Which of our neighbors have such a vessel? None. Then who does? Damn. [inaudible] rear. Cover fire. Cover fire. DAVE ZAMBORSKI: They're right on our tail. Reloading. I'm out. Throw me a mag. Hit the water. Hit the water. [inaudible] in water. Get back to the water. Moving now. Kappy, cover me. Come on. [non-english speech] Reload! [non-english speech] Kappy, get the boat. [non-english speech] KAPPY: The Zodiac's wasted, man. They're coming up behind us. [inaudible] in the water. Kappy, contact. [inaudible], watch our backs. I'm out. Kappy's hit. Come on, buddy. Kappy's dead. Cover me! [inaudible]. [gunshots] Our gunships have cut off your waterways. Alpha Eight Romeo, this is Tango Five Bravo, we have a man down. Repeat, we have a man down. Emergency top cover and extraction helo is in route. Arrival will be-- ETA, 15 minutes. ETA, 15 minutes. We're completely surrounded. They're advancing our positions. We're penned in, out of ammo. We can't resist. Over. It's your call. Understood, sir. Surrender or die in the water. You are surrounded on all sides. Throw out your weapons. You are prisoners of the Irani Revolutionary Guard. [non-english speech] We have received orders to take the prisoners aboard. It seems they are American, and there is fear of a land rescue force. So the prisoners are American, then they've come from a sub, which is still down there. Mr. Gregorov, in your opinion, what would the Americans do if we bring the prisoners aboard? What would they do? Yes, would they attack us? I don't believe the Americans would attack their own men. Good. Then we can use them as a shield, turning them into an advantage in case of a conflict. Sir, any conflict would be ill advisable with an untrained crew. Your advice is noted, but one has to always be prepared. Radio, get me shore command. Prepare to surface. Alpha Eight Romeo, this is Venom Three, playmates being loaded on cigarette en route to service Kilo. Get me the Oakland. Aye, aye, sir. Sir, the prisoners have been brought aboard. Good. Stow them aft. Yes, sir. We continue course. Oakland, this is Cargrew Eight. Cargrew Eight, this is Oakland. Over. India have taken playmates aboard your Sierra Three. Stay with them. Await further instructions. Over. Yes, sir. Roger that. [non-english speech] Look, I demand you-- Shut up. [non-english speech] Get me Admiral Martin at Central Command in Bahrain. Aye, aye, sir. Connecting with Central Command. [phone ringing] Martin here. Admiral, we have a problem. Our team and their guest have been taken hostage. Damn. Casualties? I believe one at this time, sir. What are the chances of rescue? Unknown. We're still receiving Intel. They've been taken aboard one of their subs, one previously unreported. What? A Kilo class. I'll ensure this gets to the Joint Chiefs. What is your operational plan now? We're keeping track of the situation and preparing for contingencies. Well, keep me informed up to the minute. Will do, sir. Cargrew Eight, out. Sir, schematics of the Russian Kilo class. Come on, show me. The report, sir. OK, shoot. Russian Kilo class, type EKM. Intel reports that they contracted for three of the subs in 1988, but reports only two have been delivered. Did you set them straight? Yes, sir. The first sub was delivered in October of 1992, the second in June of '93, the third, nobody knows. Intel had no information. Now the Kilo class has 18 torpedoes, 6 firing tubes, the 877 EKM is powered by a pair of diesel electric engines. Top speed, 17 knots. Our boat does-- 35 knots, sir. Good. Until we can find out what they're up to, maybe we can show them some muscle. See if they blink. They're moving, bearing 209er degrees. Range, 1,600 yards. Sir, what do you want to do? Give them some space, then follow them. Ahead one third. How's he doing? He'll be OK. But I gotta tell you, Ski, I sure as hell don't see much action in his future. No, I'm fine, damn it. I'm fine. So what's the plan? Escape and rejoin friendly forces. We're under water. If we can make it to the forward escape trunk, we can swim out and hope we get picked up. One of ours should still be in the area. Our gear is gone. Then we use their gear. Rogers, why don't you put that damn coin away? This damn coin is the reason I wasn't hit. It's my luck. Sorry, we didn't know this-- You, come with me. Hang tough, Ski. Mack, you all right? Yeah. What the hell are we going to do now? We wait until Ski gets back. What if Ski doesn't make it back? Then I'm in charge, Rogers. If they come and take me away, then Mack is on charge, then Mattox. Any more questions? [non-english speech] As long as Mr. Gregorov is on board, we will speak English. Yes, sir. Welcome. I'm Captain Reza Lashgar of the Royal Navy, your host for the next few hours or longer. I see you've Lieutenant Noussavi. You will be his responsibility while on my ship, and this is Mr. Gregorov, our advisor, formerly of the Soviet Navy. I intend to find out your military intentions one way or another. What is the frequency you use to contact your sub? Zamborski, David, Lieutenant Commander, United States Navy. 555-- Perhaps you didn't understand the question? Where is your submarine? Gone. You spooked them. Probably half way to Hawaii by now. Our submarines are now blocking the Straits. Then they'll sink them on the way out. You'll be the captain of a one boat navy. Captain, I object your treatment of prisoners. Mr. Gregorov, you're here as a technical advisor. I do not need your advice on taking prisoners. Is that understood? Now, how do we signal this submarine of yours? What is the frequency, hm? Our intent is only to have them leave our shores. Tell them we'll release you if they surface. I'll die first. I think you will. Store him below. Bring me another American now! [non-english speech] Sir, that sounded like a gunshot. Sir, should we ready the [inaudible]?? Negative, only one shot. We don't want to break contact. Stay in their baffles, Dobbins. Come on, guys, let's get real. They shot him. Look, Mattox, it ain't over till we're dead. Adapt, improvise, and overcome. You guys know the drill. Now, look, if Ski didn't tell them what they wanted to know, they're going to be back down here to take another one of us. And when they do, that's how we're going to get out of here. Well, out of this room. How do we get off the sub? Forward escape trunk, just like Ski said. Which is on the other end of the boat and getting there is a whole other question. I studied Russian and Chinese subs in A School. Now, if we stick to the lower decks, we have a much better chance. Better chance? Better chance than what? Cord, it's your call. OK. What are we talking about, length of a football field? Little less, 260. Let's not forget, we ain't got no weapons. Except ourselves. Hey, I'm all for it. I could stand a little hand to hand combat. That's right, Mattox, we're stronger than these guys, and we are smarter. Yeah, but what if we get to the forward escape trunk and there's only a couple sets of tanks. Buddy breathe. Hey, don't forget we have an injured civilian here. I can handle it. I'm better now. All right, gentlemen, that's our plan. Now, how do we take these guards out? Suggestions? [grunting] Are we clear? Not yet. Clear. Come on, let's go. Clear. Let's do it. Come on, man, let's go. Mattox, we're going to find a radio room and signal for emergency pick up. All right, take Van Tassel with you guys. We'll meet at the forward escape trunk ASAP. You got it? Go. Go. Take this [inaudible]. What is keeping them? Maybe they don't like your hospitality. Find out. Yes. sir. Captain Lashgar, this is Lieutenant Noussavi. The prisoners have escaped. [non-english speech] Check with Daniel Boone to see if they're still in contact with those subs that they sighted earlier. Aye, sir. [non-english speech] Con sonar, more gunfire, sir. How many shots? Four. Two groups of two in rapid succession. Double taps, that's our boys. What's going on over there? When you're captured, what's the code? Make every effort to escape. Bring us up to periscope depth. Get a good course plot. Speed on that boat so we can pick them up again. Aye, sir. Very good. You carry on. Admiral, the Oakland has initiated radio contact. Patch me in. Oakland, this is Cargrew Eight, over. We've got gunfire on board Sierra Three. Sounds like our boys are loose. Sir, if they are, there's a chance they're trying to get off that pick boat. How much of a chance? If they can find the escape hatch, if we're not in deep water so decompression will not be a problem, but the ocean currents could be, and I have two of my best men working on those details as we speak. Good. I'll have a rescue chopper and a decompression chamber ready. Let's give these boys all the support they need. Roger that. We have sonar contact of the American submarine. They have surfaced to-- And gave away their position. Where are they? Directly behind us, sir. Well, you said the Americans would never fire on their own men. Now we'll find out how well you've advised us. Mr. Gregorov, take us around lag coordinates and prepare to fire. That is an act of war. Mr. Gregorov, this is neither the place nor the time to argue with me. Just do it. Time to intercept the American sub? Three minutes, sir. Load tubes three and four and arm torpedoes. Flooding tubes three and four. We're changing course. How you doing on rounds? OK? I shouldn't have double tapped those guys. We gotta get more weapons. Kitchen. We'll stop for a sandwich later. There'll be knives in the kitchen. Maybe some cleaning chemicals that I could put to use. OK, let's go. Come on. Come on. She's turning, sir, heading right towards us. Intercept time? Less than two minutes. Time to break out the good China, folks. Looks like we've got company. Mr. Montero, Mr. Pleshe, prepare for evasive action. [non-english speech] Intercept time, 45 seconds, sir. Mr. Dobbins, have I ever told you about my pit bull Mr. Razor? No. No, sir. Well, I had this old rope swing in my backyard. Mr. Razor would jump up and grab the rope at a certain height and spin till he got dizzy and fell down. 25 seconds, sir. And I began to think, this is not very good for Mr. Razor's teeth, so I lowered the rope, I put the swing on the ground. I figured he wouldn't bite something ground level. He's opening torpedo doors. Preparing to fire. Guess what? He jumped up and bit at the same height. Fire. Torpedoes fired. Coming right at us. Dive officer, take us down 45 degree bubble. Aye. sir. Mr. Montero, launch countermeasures now. Countermeasures away, sir. Torpedoes missed, sir. Did not arm. Coming to zero level. Leveling off. Zero bubble. Just like that dog, people sometimes aim at the same place, even though the target's changed position. Mr. Pleshe, plot a course into the mouth of the Straits. Aye, sir. Mr. Dobbins, all ahead full. Aye, sir. All ahead full. Let's out run these sea camels and send a SITREP on the ELF. [non-english speech] Get me NABSET. Aye, sir. [phone ringing] FEMALE SPEAKER: Admiral Perry on the line. Patch him through. Admiral Perry. The enemy has engaged in an attack against the Oakland. Any damage? No, but I'd like to use the Oakland to draw this new player out of the Gulf and right in the middle of the Fifth Fleet. Maybe then they'll consider giving up the hostages. It's your call, Jim. I've got a squadron of F-14s flying over to establish presence. Jim, good luck. Bernie, how far behind us are they? Almost a mile. Almost a mile. Let's slow down a little. We don't want to lose them. Indicate five knots. Sir, if we're not going to engage them and we're not going to out run them, what's our course of action? Keep them busy. The more men they need to find us, less men they'll have to find Ski and his team. Van, what you got? Mr. Van Tassel? Oh. Chlorine and ammonia, homemade tear gas. Burns the eyes, lungs, all the mucous membrane. OK, just [inaudible]. Cooking grease napalm. Light it, throw it, boom, watch it burn. These are called bang sticks. Now they're filled with match heads. You light the end, it'll spray fire and debris at whoever it's aimed at. That's the best that I can do with kitchen materials. That'll work, Doc. Let's go. [non-english speech] Com, this is the search party. They have been in the galley, sir. They're headed for the front of the ship. [non-english speech] [non-english speech] Hey, buddy. [non-english speech] Ah. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Go up. I'm tapped. [non-english speech] Level 2 hallway near the ward room. We need more speed. The boat is already at full speed. We're losing them. If you destroy the submarine, you will start a war your country cannot win. Mr. Gregorov, intentional or not, we've killed one of them. We are at war. You know the frequency the Oakland's going to be on? Spent a little time on subs. All right, Gertrude. Yes. All right, it's good for close range. They'll definitely hear Morse code. Con, sonar. Sir, we're getting a Gertrude transmission from the enemy sub in Morse code. What do they have to say? It's the SEAL team, forward escape trunk. Need rescue. How can we be sure it's them? Switchblades. There you go. Respond affirmative. We'll be there. [whispering] Picking us up. We're out here. Let's go. Ow. wait, wait, wait. How you doing, Boss? Outstanding, Rogers. Outstanding. Never better. Look, if I don't make it out of here for any reason-- We're all making it out of here. Yeah. Yeah. Damn near all of us. Listen to me. I spent most of my sorry life alone, and I would just prefer not to die that way. Don't talk like that. Thanks. Now get my stubborn ass up. Con, sonar, Sierra Three at bearing 250. Range, 4,500 yards. All stations manned and ready, sir. Conditions Zebra set. Webbs, load tubes one and two with mark 60s. Tuned at torpedo signature. Flood the torpedo tubes. Prepare to fire.

We'll be entering the Straits of Hormuz in 1 minute 26 seconds. How close are they, Bernie? Like glue, sir. [non-english speech] We've got the high ground this time. Yeah, but they've got the guns. [non-english speech] Chlorine gas has been detected in Section 4. It could be seawater on batteries. We must immediately SEAL off entire lower section. Do so. Captain, it is a very dangerous situation. We must surface to vent. Are there reports of flooding? No, but the escaped prisoners-- Escaped to where? There is no way of this submarine. Load torpedo tubes. Prepare to fire. Sir, I'm picking up a sonar contact bearing 00 relative. Sounds like a Kilo right off the nose. Bernie, time to intercept? Less than a minute. Sir, their tube doors are opening. They're preparing to fire. Don't give them a chance to say Allah. Flood tubes three and four, assign presets. Firing solution locked into computer. Open outer doors, prepare to fire. Fire control range to target. Range is 200 yards. Fire tubes three and four. Torpedoes away, sir. Sir, if we continue on course, we'll be sailing right through the wreckage. The only way out of here is to keep it steady. 4, 3, 2, 1, impact. Hold on. Con, sonar, heavy debris, sir. What do you got? Mr. Dobbins, damage report. None, sir, but that Diesel is still behind us. Good. Let's lead it into the Gulf, and see if it wants to tangle with the entire Fifth Fleet. Captain, launch the Viking sub hunters and drop a line of sonar buoys at the exit of the Strait. I want to know the minute they come through. Mr. Pleshe, you ever own a Camaro? Sir. I got a '67 back home, hopped up four bangers. I like to take it out on Snake Road and see how fast I can take the corners. That's what I want to do here, see how fast we can take the corners. Give me a plan designed down to the second. Aye, aye, sir. We are going too fast. The engines are already straining. If we do not burn these engines, we stand a very good chance of running aground in these narrow straits because the insufficient training for our crew for such difficult maneuvers. Mr. Gregorov, isn't that your purpose aboard this ship, to make sure that they are? I suggest you start doing your job, because I will catch the American sub. Just plot the map. One hell of a frog. Come on, let's get him out of here. Sir, how are we going do to this? I can't carry both of you. Don't you worry about me. I'll get my ass out of here. But we don't leave our dead behind. Now, grab him. Chief. Chief. I respectfully suggest we get the living off first. I'll come back once we reach the escape hatch. You and I both know there's no coming back, Rogers. Get his ring. Come on. Get his ring. Sir, they're headed for the escape tunnel. Bring a right hard rudder, steady course 051. Aye, sir. Right hard rudder, steady course 051. Aye, sir. Right hard rudder. Let's bring it left, hard rudder, steady course 090. Left hard rudder, steady course 090. Aye, sir. Left hard rudder 090. Leveling off. I thought Cord and Rogers would be here waiting for us. So did I. Drop your weapon. Shoot him, Rogers. Drop your weapon. Your time has come, American. Why don't you just go to hell? Where's my coin? Come on. Forget about the damn coin, Rogers. That's not what saved your life. You did. Now, come on, we've got a date with an escape hatch. But they can't outrun our torpedoes. If you fire into canyon, you may start avalanche. Mr. Gregorov, enough of your advising. Now I'll show you what this ship is capable of. Flood tubes one and three. Prepare to fire. They're flooding their tubes, sir. When I tell you, throw the rudder hard left. Aye, sir. Assign presets. Firing solution locked into computer. Open outer doors. Opening other doors. Range to target. Range 1,400 yards and closing. Fire tubes one and three. Reloading tubes. Two torpedoes coming in. Ready? Now. Shift to rudder. Aye, sir. Contact. It's not the target. Sounds like we hit the canyon. The walls are starting to give way. You fool. Out of my way. Reverse engines. Full back. I give the orders here. No, you don't. We're going down. Con, sonar, Sierra Three has hit the wall of the canyon. She's going down. XO, bring us around. Make ready to rescue the team. Aye, sir. Top. You all right? Yeah, come on, go, go, go. Mattox? Hey, man. What are you guys doing? What took you so long? Rogers, can you signal the Oakland? Tell them we're coming out? Yes, sir. We found some of their scuba gear. Captain, banging on the sub, sir. Morse code. From the team, five coming out the escape hatch. Have radio send the flash ELF message to Coral Sea. We need to have some birds up on top to help rescue the team. Aye, sir. Rogers, you provide cover and follow. Get Van Tassel suited up. Sir, we're receiving flash traffic from the Oakland. Any damage with that engagement? Negative. They're requesting emergency rescue operation at 56 longitude, 27 latitude. Sierra Three is down. Playmates are evacuating. Captain, vector and rescue helo. Rogers, we'll see you back on the surface. The prisoners are escaping. Bring us up. [inaudible] Nyet. Con, sonar, escape hatch is open, sounds like two are coming out, sir. Dobbins, what's the status on the rescue from Coral Sea? Should be above in 10 minutes, sir. So you want to be a frog man, huh? Taxi's waiting outside. Move it. Mr. Gregorov, this is a direct order. Do it! Nyet. This is an act of mutiny. Step aside, Mr. Gregorov. You're mad. Blow ballast. Con, sonar, she's starting to move. What do we do, sir? We wait. Diver away, sir. Sir, Valley Forge is reporting Sierra Three is blowing ballast and rising. Status of how many of our guys are survivors? Four confirmed, sir. Move the Daniel Boone in to support the Oakland. We're not out of this yet, guys. Mr. Dobbins, let's see what Sierra Three's intentions are. Captain has the con. Let's lead him away from the rescue effort. All ahead full. Right full rudder, steady course 045. Are we in firing position? Not yet, sir. Still coming around. All stations manned and ready? Aye, sir. Flood tubes one and three. Flooding tubes one and three, sir. Steady as she goes. Open outer doors on all torpedo tubes. Sir, their tube doors are opening. Distance, 2,000 yards. Bearing 000 relative. Lock firing solutions. Firing solution locked into computer, sir. Fire tubes one and three. Torpedoes away, sir. Torpedoes coming in. Do something. Firing position in 3, 2, 1. No! Did we get him, Mr. Dobbins? Affirmative, sir. We have wrenching mental. Mr. Pleshe, plot a course to Bahrain. I have a feeling there's going to be some reports to be filled out. Aye, sir. XO, take the con. Aye, sir. XO has the con. US diplomatic officials are applauding the rescue this morning of American scientist John Van Tassel. With Van Tassel's safe return, the White House believes it has at least temporarily deterred the advance of chemical weapons production in the Middle East. Mack Nichol, GNN News at US Naval Forces Central Command Headquarters, Manamah, Bahrain. Captain Bill McKay, it's a pleasure. Welcome to shore. Thank you, sir. For a while there, I wasn't sure we were going to make it. You did one hell of a good job. My crew does all the work. I just take the credit. Come on, I want to introduce you to somebody. Somebody who wants to thank you. It got pretty dicey down there, huh? I've been in sub service most of my life, and I've never seen any action like that. Hopefully, I'll retire next year and not see any more. Captain, damn good to see you. It's an honor to meet you, sir. This way. Attention on deck. At ease, men. Bill, you've met the team? Yes, sir, I have. The civilian is a Dr. Van Tassel. Doctor, Captain Bill McKay. Doctor, good to see you back. It's good to be back, Captain. Casualties? We lost two men, sir. Petty Officer Third Class George Kaplan and our team leader Lieutenant Commander Zamborski. Ski was a good friend of mine. Mine too, sir. To absent friends. To absent friends. To absent friends.
