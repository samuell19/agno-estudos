Aren't you married? Marriage is a celebration in countryside. In Big cities, it is a regret. Oh no. "O crazy heart better brace yourself." "You must know how to pleasure yourself." "Don't think twice and, just do-do-do it.." "Just do this sin...!" "The world's full of disappointment." "Your happiness is in your Palm.." "Don't wait..and celebrate this joy." "Just do this sin...!" "As they say that.." "even walls have ears." "So do it without making a noise." "You don't need anyone's help.." "cause you're a proud man." - Hello. - Hello..

Okay, we've two big announcements today. First; We have a new addition to the 'My Handy' team. Prabha Ghatpande. Please give her a big round of applause. Never mind. - Pandey. - Yes, sir. Sensation is the new motto of our company.. She's a virgin. And what you are holding is our new toilet paper rolls. I can tell by just looking at her. 3 times softer, more absorbent, and colorful. And now.. Just close your eyes.. And feel this toilet paper. Like this. You felt it! I saw your eyes open. You felt it. - Sir.. - You felt it. - Yes.. tell me.. - Sir, it's the pin.. No, even my eyes opened like this. When I first felt it on my cheeks, it was.. Magical. You know, I always wondered.. In a country, where we don't have enough water to drink.. How do people find water to clean their backside? And then I realized.. It's not about the water. It's about the touch of the hand! And this toilet paper comes closest to that touch! What? You don't believe me. Oh you will. Now, one by one.. You will rub this on your cheeks. No, I am not talking about these cheeks. I'm telling you, dude. His father was doing a good job. Sales were good. God knows what knowledge this Jackass has got from America. Wiping one's butt has become a psychological research. In fact, given a chance this guy would.. Pull down people's pants himself, and..yuck! He is crazy. Coming? "Disappear into your own little world." "Make yourself scarce like a secret." "Make your plans right now." Prabha. What a divine name. No one keeps such names anymore. But if you think, the name can even arouse you. Say it. Prabha! What's up bro... I've noticed you're always in a bad mood these days. Is everything okay at home? I mean, Pandey told me.. You stay in the office till late hours. Don't mind..and, I don't mean any disrespect. Your wife's really gorgeous. But..you don't value her. Your Marriage is like a Rock Ballet.. Don't turn it into a Church Gospel. Trust me; just give it to her tonight! Surprise! Women love surprises. And don't forget to take flowers. I'm speaking from experience. Got it. Leaving early, sir? There is a flower shop downstairs, right? - Will it be open? - I think.. Ohh... it's Wednesday. Flower market's closed today. - The entire flower market's closed today? - Yes, sir. [Song playing on TV] - Yeah Baby. - What are you doing Ranjit. Surprise.. One day he'll barge in saying that. And we'll be gasping. Stop it, Ranjit. You make everything sound so vulgar. Dev always texts me before he leaves for home. That's true. By the way.. What does this Dev look like? Like a husband. - Dev.. - We didn't do it. Dev! Dev! Dev! Dev.. - No, no.. Dev.. - We didn't do it. - No, no.. Dev..Dev, please. - No! No! "I gave you.." "my delicate heart." "I gave you..my delicate heart." "Don't ever break it..my love." "The bond we share.." "don't ever share it with anyone else." "Never.." "Because you're my bliss.." "Because you're my bliss.." "Because you're my bliss.." "my love." "Because you're my bliss.." "Because you're my bliss.." "Because you're my bliss.." "my love." "I gave you..my delicate heart." "Don't ever break it..my love." "The bond we share.." "don't ever share it with anyone else." "Never.." "Because you're my bliss.." "Because you're my bliss.." "Because you're my bliss.." "my love." You're back, Tommy. Tommy.. Come here. Here Boy. What's this 'Tommy' nonsense? So should I straight call you a Dog! - Dolly, please.. - Tommy wait, stop.. Wait..stop..excuse me. Where were you dicking around? Hey.. Whose rotten food were you feasting on... Tell me. Dolly! Hey, Tommy. Forget it. Let me take a look at your neck. What if someone put a leash on you? But how can someone put a leash on you? After all, you're a mangy cur. Must be lying in a dumpster! Dolly! Don't bark! Just tell me where you had been. Otherwise..I'll tell papa.. To stop giving you the 10,000 rupees every week. I went to a bar.. With my friends. Bar? Friends? Vishal, Sumit, and Bhonsle! My old gym trainers. We used to work together. Feel free to ask. Who paid? It was Bhonsle's treat. You're such a freeloader. You're already sucking us dry.. At least leave your friends alone. Friends don't mind. Then let them pay for your expenses as well. And leave me alone. And stop cutting your nose hair all the time. Mister.. Please call Jatin. - Who? - Jatin. Jatin. He just went inside. There is no Jatin here. - Isn't this Jatin Gupta's house? - No. I see.. 10 secrets ways to find out someone's name.. Even I have this Whatsapp message. You want his name? Do you want his name? Yes. 100 rupees. Dolly Verma. Corporator Digpal Verma's daughter. And the guy who just went inside? 100 rupees more. Ranjit Arora.. Dolly Verma's husband! Did you pay the Dhanadan Tv Bill? Dev.. I am asking you. Bill.. So..how was the surprise? What's wrong? She didn't like it. I see. Which flowers did you take? Roses? Damn... That's where you went wrong. You should've got orchids instead. She would've kissed you. I'm speaking from experience. Anyway..let me lighten your mood with a joke. Don't worry. After dinner, husband to his brother. 'You know what, your sister-in-law is really blessed.' 'The food she makes satisfies my soul!' Brother to husband, 'why of course, she is truly blessed.' 'Because it's not just you, it's the entire neighbourhood that she has satisfied' Husband faints. - Dev my man. - Sir. I've got a present for you. I bought this during my college time.. At George Town, Kentucky.. It got me through my darkest hours. And now, it's yours. Sir. Take it. The point is that now you need it. I know you're reeling under a lot of pressure of your Home Loan. Sir. - And you've raise due as well. - Sir. But, I can't give you a raise at this time. Sir..m..my..my EMI.. - Sir, my EMis are.. - I get it. - My.. - No, no, I get it. But the company is going through a transition.. For it's ultimate glory. And we need all the funds. First of all; Our sales are an all-time low. And we're up against our greatest threat. The jet-spray. Typical middle-class invention. Have you tried it? Have you tried it? What, sir? The jet-spray. No, sir. - Should I? - No! It's disgusting. Half the time's wasted in trying to aim. Such a waste of water. Sit-sit-sit. I've got to stop it at all cost, Dev. For the future of the next generation. Because I care. And I know you do too. Before..I saw your eyes open. No, sir, it was just a pin that.. You see, the Third World War.. Will be fought for water. And the only thing that can save it, is this. Do you want to see the Third World War, Dev? Huh, Dev? No, sir. Yeah..exactly.. And that's why I have decided.. That you'll be leading our new toilet-paper campaign. This is much better than a raise, Dev. So make sure you shake it up, Dev. Alright. Shake it up! Hello, is that Mr. Dev speaking? This is Vaishali speaking from New Bombay Co-operative Bank! Sir, your last month's EMI is due. When will you make payment? 'Did you pay for the Dhanadhan Tv subscription?' 'Surprise.. Someday he'll come barging inside saying that!' 'The company is going through a transition.' 'And we'll be gasping.' 'I can't give you a raise right now.' 'Ranjit Arora..' 'Dolly Verma's husband.' 'How does he look?' 'Like a husband.' 'When will you make payment?' Tomorrow or day after.. Hello. Day after.. Sir, cash or cheque? Hello. Cash! - Morning or evening? - Evening! Thank you sir. It's got dual-sim, radio, LED torch, 20 hour battery life. Only 1500. 1500? Fine, I'll take it. And a prepaid sim-card as well. "Revenge!" He could've sold credit-cards or even underwear.. But toilet paper? Fine..I know it's nothing to brag about.. But, it's not all that bad. You know.. You were really hasty in getting married. What? I got married in a haste? What did you say to me? I'm going to Igatpuri for four weeks to learn Yoga. But you returned after 6 months with a Mercedes and a wife. And I was hasty? Speak up. Soy milk reduces cholesterol. Try it. Shut up. Idiot. It's such a pain to read these texts. Ma..Married.. Married woman.. Affair! Text: Affair with a married woman?? Text: What do you want? He's not picking up. Who is it? He is asking for just 100,000! - Do you have 100,000? - No! - Then how is it 'just' 100,000? - Yeah.. Correct! Who can it be? I don't know. Damn, He wants it tomorrow! Just pay him. - Pay him? - Yes. I don't even have money for protein powder. There is no money. Then ask your wife. You married her for money right? No money. You know I am treated like a dog in that house. I get meat only on Sundays. - So what do we do? - I don't know. Ranjit, please. Your wife is our only hope. You get it! Do something.. anything.. Make some excuse, or cook up a story.. But you have to do something, or else we'll get in big trouble. What if Dev finds out? He says he'll tell Dolly. - S♪♪♪ - Ranjit! Ranjit! "Teach the king a lesson." "Show him the might of a knight." "Go on a picnic with the queen." Baby.. Baby? Last time you called me 'baby' was in 2010. Back then you wanted a Mercedes. What do you want now freeloader? Exactly. I am tired of begging. From You! From Papa. I've finally decided. I'm going to start my own business. But.. Business? Okay.. What business? Huh? What business are you going to do? Import business. Only import. And no export. No..I'll export as well. Import and Export. Okay. So what are you going to import and what will you export? So what are you going to import.. And what will you export, you dog? Dogs! Huh! Dogs! I'll import them from Taiwan.. And export them to China. It's got a great scope. No one else is doing it. I have a friend who's a dog breeder.. And he has all the information. We are in it together. Which friend? That..Dev Dev.. Why are you sc♪♪♪ up poor Dev's life? Dolly, listen.. I want to change.. Honestly. For me. For you. For us! And guess, what I need for all this? Just 100,000 rupees. There..now you're showing your true colors. Baby, if I was sc♪♪♪ with you.. Would I have said anything less than 5 million? Think? Am I going to lie for 100,000? Please, baby. Please.. I'll think about it. Huh! I'll think about it. Okay. I said Hello! To Whom? The new girl... Prabha. She's a very decent girl. I am sure she has never French-kissed in her life. Girls who French-kiss have puffy lips. But her lips are very delicate, sweet. There she is. - Prabha. - Yeah. Have you met Dev? - Hi. - Nice meeting you. In case you need anything.. Or you need help with something... you can ask Dev. Of course... after all you're heading the new campaign. Yeah. We will talk later. Cool.. See you then. Some rascal stole my wife's photo. Who, sir? Come, let me show you. That MOFO..Pandey. He lusts after my wife. I have seen it in his eyes. But sir, Pandey.. You just keep an eye on him for me. Okay. Yes, sir. Alright. Now let's get to work. Something incredible happened today. This morning, I was using the toilet paper like always.. When suddenly, I had an epiphany. An idea which will make people.. Desperate to buy our toilet paper. Guns don't kill people, bullets do. Without the bullet, the gun won't fire. You get it. - I get it. - Alright. Now, on the day of our product launch.. You'll turn off the water supply for this entire area. I will turn off the water supply for this entire area? Me? I can't do it, sir. Dev..a woman in Jharkhand married a dog. - Sir.. - Dev.. Dev.. This is India. Anything is possible. So..go to the Municipal Commissioner's office.. And get it done. Cut off the water supply. And let's see how these people wash their backside. Seriously..Jharkhand. That reminds me of an incredible joke. These days there's a very popular cougar joke doing rounds... Name's Moon. Pappu returns from school and tells aunt Moon. Aunt Moon.. Aunt Moon... - You know the teacher today.. - I'll tell you a joke today. - Huh.. - I'll tell you a joke today. Listen.. You? - You're going to tell a joke. - Just listen. - No, no, no.. - Just listen. Fine..tell me. Hold on.. - Now tell me. - One day.. A husband returns home early from work.. With flowers to surprise his wife. Flower. He gets home. But in the bedroom.. He sees his wife is sleeping with another man. What the.. That's my kind of joke. Listen.. Yeah, what next. - Guess what the husband does next? - What? The husband starts blackmailing the guy. Your wife? Oh my, God. Ohh... that rose day? Why didn't you catch her red-handed? I want to teach them a lesson. Ohh for god's sake... That guy was bonking your wife. Why didn't you beat him up? I don't like violence. Great... You don't like violence but you are okay with blackmail? Because I need the money. Hold on.. Do you want to teach him a lesson or take money from him? Both. Both. Buddy.. I've seen in films.. Its people like you who turn out to be the serial killer in the end. How much did you ask for? "Revenge." "When life screws your plans. Embarrasses you, my man." "Plays you like a fiddle. Makes and example out of you." "When you're out for revenge and you're hit below the belt.." "You see the devil in beloved's face." "Only one way to get out."

"Life's going to stab you in the back stick it all the way across." "It's going to tear up your plans. So be prepared.." "No one knows which way the world spins." "The crow takes the shine, and the crane's polluted.." "Money's the main factor here, creating a stir." "This jungle's disdain. Your loss is his gain." "Don't be greedy, What is the worth of money." "You're smart, you know it, don't let the out of your head." "Like a butterfly chasing a cheater." "They look decent, but inside they are evil." "Make them all pay.." "Keep all the money for yourself." "It's the new rule of life. - Cheat your own people." "You must beat your own people, in order to win." "Game on baby." "Revenge." "Who won, and who lost."

He wasn't ready to believe it. It was really incredible, Dolly, you know.. Import-Export! Yes, papa. Dolly told me.. That you're going to start an import-export business. Yes, papa. Bravo, son. Dolly, I always knew he'll do something so great.. That I will be forced to proudly shake hands with him. Dolly dear, get me a drink. You dog, your entire family.. Rummaged leftovers from the garbage. And you will do import-export? You pulled a fast one on my daughter. But don't try to fool me. You know my history, don't you? I tried to get you killed three times. But, thanks to my daughter's prayers.. You survived every time. If you don't return this money in three days.. I will make sure the prayers go unheard this time. Malti. Get the ice. - What's going on? - Handshake. Happy Anniversary Dolly dear. Happy Diwali Dolly dear.

We wouldn't have forced you to marry Dev. Who knew there's a rascal behind that innocent face? Please, mom. Can you lend me the money? You know what.. Sell your father's kidney. Drinking water again. How many times do you drink water? The doctor has advised you against it. But why sell my kidney? Forget it. Dev.. Dev, I needed 90,000. 90,000? But why? Papa needs to get some tests done. What test cost 90,000? Angiography. Dev..I wouldn't have asked if it wasn't for father. Please. Fine, I'll give you tomorrow. Congratulations, buddy. Prabha has agreed for a date.

We haven't eaten kidney beans for the last 10 years. Control yourself.. I am right here. By the way, how did you know it's me? Tell me. Do you suspect anyone? What's the reason for blackmail? "Affair with a married woman." - It just happened. - It's okay. So..you must have a wife too. How do you know? Most of Chawla's cases are like that. Boy with girl.. Girl with boy.. These days a lot of boys with boys too.. Dogs, cats, cattle, sheep.. No one's safe these days. - You know, in Jharkhand.. - I get it. All I want to know is whether you can find the blackmailer or not. Hold this. Look.. Read the third line. 97% success.. 97% success rate! I hope I won't fall under the 3%. - Let it be.. - No Sir.. Fees? 20,000! 10,000 advance. 10,000 after the job. Plus daily allowance. Food, traveling, internet package. If you pay by cheque or RTGS.. Then you'll be charged 18% GST. You can also get a bill if you want. But with 5% Vat extra. It's too much. It goes to the government, we have no cut. The fee is too much. Not more than what you're paying the blackmailer. So pay up. Here? Yeah, they are all like family. No need to worry. What will you do if I find the blackmailer's name? I'll shoot him. You're very lucky. I must say very lucky. Why? Chawla even deals in guns. I see.. By the way..where is Chawla? Uncle.. No, son! Dev sir, for you. Who gave it? Prabha madam..who works in our office. Where is she? She didn't come today. Sick leave. She threw a party last night. She invited everyone. Didn't she invite you? Fine. Yes, sir. Bablu..I need details of a number. Stop showing attitude.. Fine, I'll pay you 1000 rupees. Note down the number. 885.. Come, buddy. Listen..where does Prabha stay? You too. Last night I told you she's a.. Just give me her address! What is it, Dev? We need to talk. Did you bring my money? That's what we need to talk about. There won't be any negotiation. Open the door I need to talk to you. Fine, I'm opening the door. Bablu, you took really long. What? Did you find him? What's his name? Dev.. Dev Kaushal. Great.. Thank you. Why did you stop? Speak up, and make it quick. What is it? Look, I cannot give you any more money. I am already under a lot of pressure to pay my loans for home, car.. Your home's already broken. And you don't have to pay anyway. You are demanding the money from your wife's boyfriend, right? So just add my share as well. Simple. I cannot ask for more money. Then don't.. Sell your house. I want my money. What? Not again. Look at me and talk. When will you pay me? - I won't give you any more money. - Huh. - I won't give you any more money. - You won't. Yes, I won't give any more money. - Are you sure? - You can do anything you want. I can do anything. Then I'm going to tear my clothes.. And scream that you're raping me. - Help! - No, no, no. - Anybody there! - No, no, no. - Anybody there! - No, no, no. Fine.. So? When will you pay me? I'm leaving. Where..where are you going? My money.. Prabha. Wait. Wait. Asleep so soon? She knows we're coming. Prabha dear. I had a spare key. Open the door, dear. Yes I'm searching. Wait a minute. Found it. Found it. Here.. Prabha! Prabha! Prabha! Hey Stop him! Stop! Stop! Hey catch him. Catch him! Stop! Where is he? Look there. Hey catch him! He must be somewhere around. Find him. I think he went in the back alley. Let's go. Stop there. Hey catch him! Look there also. Mister, did you see a nude guy run past here. Nude.. No, but someone ran past here in an underwear. Guys, he went this way. He went this way. She just joined us recently. This week? Yes sir. Okay. Prabha. - Good morning sir. - Good morning. Shinde, take everyone's statement. Yes sir. What happened? Come to the cabin. Coffee? Tea? What's going on? - You killed her, didn't you? - Who? I knew it.. Guys like you turn out to be the serial killer. Are you crazy? What are you talking about? - Prabha. - What happened to her? How did you kill her? Did you strangle her? - Did you butcher her? - No.. I will tell everyone. I will tell the Police. I'll tell the boss. - Anand.. I swear I didn't even meet her. - You are lying. - No, no, I.. - You're lying, dude. You know she was such a hottie. We could have.. Hello. Yes. It's definitely soft. Yes, it's 3-ply technology. Dev, please come in. Meet Inspector Rawle. He's investigating Prabha's murder case. Inspector Rawle, this is Dev, my right-hand man. Did you know Prabha? I mean..I didn't know her well. She joined a few days back. So you guys were not close? What...? I mean, you two didn't talk much. No..Anand introduced me to her once. - Anand who? - We are colleagues. Was he Prabha's friend? They were.. Actually, he's my friend but he liked her. I see.. And Prabha? I don't know.. He just told me that they went on a date once. Did anything happen that night? How would I know, sir? All he said was that she's a virgin. Virgin! - Send Anand inside. - Yes, sir. Anand..come inside. Yes sir. Yes sir. - Anand.. - Yes sir i'm coming. - Anand, they are calling you inside. - I know. If anyone asks you.. Then please don't tell anyone that you gave me her address. Why not? I will tell them everything. What are you saying? Why will you tell them that? Why shouldn't I? - Then I'll be in trouble. - It's good then. - Aren't we friends? - I don't have a friend.. Listen.. What are you saying? You should've thought this before killing her. I swear I didn't do anything. Fine, I won't tell anyone. But I want Prabha's share now. - You want money? - Yeah.. - Aren't you my friend? - I am no friend. Are you going to pay up or not? - Will you pay me or not? - I will give you the money. Okay. I will give you the money. - Which car did you take on your date? - My car of course. Where's the key? - There's the key, sir. - Come on. - But why, sir.. - Give me the keys. - I haven't done anything.. - Hurry up. I said hurry up. Honestly sir, we only went on one date. What can I do? Nothing happened that day. - And the next day.. - Which is your car? This one. Open it. - Sir, there's nothing in the car. - I said open it. - Check it. - Yes sir. - Open the trunk. - I don't keep anything.. I said open the trunk. - Take a look. - There's nothing in here, sir. Did you find anything? See for yourself. You won't find anything. - Take him in. - No, sir. That's not mine. - How dare you kill a virgin girl? - No sir.. Hello. Dev Kaushal. You are a busy man. Who? You don't know Chawla. But Chawla knows everything about you. Chawla who? Manoj Chawla? Just Chawla. Yes tell me. Chawla wants to meet. Whom? You of course. But why? You're the Blackmailer. When and where that Chawla will text you. Okay. Be there on time. You know time is money. So you're trying to say that Dev is blackmailing his wife's lover. And he told you this. And you told Prabha. Then Prabha started blackmailing him. Yes, sir.. Which is why he killed Prabha. This sounds like a story of some B-grade film. You Virgin Killer. - I swear, I.. - Hey. Don't try to impress our sir by talking in Marathi. I swear, sir. The night Prabha was killed.. Dev asked me for her address. I gave it to him myself. What is the name of his wife's lover? He didn't tell me that. Move.. Do you guys ever study? Why do always get beaten up? Stop drinking. How are you? Go on. I said go. Have you decided which one you want to buy?
