250, 300, 350. 350, are you done? 400, 400, 400. [GAVEL BANGING] Fly press with dies and punches. Finally, lot 74, Managing Director. Good condition, brain hardly used, who's going to start us off? Do I hear 100 pounds? - No. 10 pounds? 1 pound? 10 pence? - Yeah, OK. 10p. Well, it's a perfectly reasonable umbrella. Scrubs, 10p. I do not understand. I simply do not understand. No? Well, I suppose I just felt sorry for you after everything my brother told me about you. That is not what I do not understand. Ah. How can it happen that a man, an intelligent, enterprising man, can be declared bankrupt when he has money in the bank and he's selling his goods at a profit? Quite easily. Tell me about it. After all, we are both in the same business. But I am upmarket, and you are downmarket. I know. But then my business is booming, and yours is bust. Isn't it absurd? Is there no justice in business? No. But there is logic. So tell me about it. Very well. I had a brilliant idea, one of the greatest creative ideas of the century. Look, Carruthers Coupled Cutlery, ideal for buffet lunches, family picnics, and camping holidays. The knork slices the sausage with one end, spears it with the other. The spork fixes the strawberry on one end, scoops up the cream with the other. The spife takes the jam with one end, spreads it with the other. The hiker's friend like Campus Companion, Carruthers Coupled Cutlery. And what's more, the inventive brilliance was matched by the financial sophistication. - It wasn't. - It was. I can't wait to hear about it. Let me demonstrate. I calculated that I could sell my coupled cutlery for 200 pounds a case, and that I could produce and sell 10 cases a week. Total sales revenue, 2,000 pounds a week. But I went into even more detail. I worked out that my costs would be only 1,000 pounds a week, labor, material, and overhead. That meant a thousand pounds a week profit on 10 cases. See? Or to make things easier for simpler minds, 100 pounds cost per case leaving 100 pounds profit per case. Highly satisfactory. So what went wrong? Nothing. Well, nothing, really. It was just that I only managed five crates a week instead of 10. Ah. That's with 100 pounds profit per case. That simply meant 500 pounds profit a week instead of 1,000 pounds. Man can jog along on 500 a week. So why aren't you jogging along? That is what I do not understand. Could you show me how you arrived at that 1,000 pound figure in detail? You mean in even greater detail? Very well. Income, 10 cases at 200 pounds each, 2,000 pounds. Expenditure, strip metal, 10 consignments, 35 pounds each, 350 pounds. Lubricants, packaging, and so on, 50 pounds. Part-time labor, bit of extra typing, bit of help on sales, 100 pounds. The three lads at 100 pounds a week each, 300 pounds. Overheads and general marketing, 200 pounds. Total expenditure, 1,000 pounds. Subtract from income of 2,000 pounds, profit, 1,000 pounds. There. How was that? Very good, except it didn't happen. But it, it, it half happened. Oh, yes. Would you mind changing it to show what actually happened? Why? I mean, it's bound to come out at 500 pounds profit instead of a thousand pounds. Even so. [SIGH] Have to spell it out for some people. Right, income down to 1,000 pounds. Now, half the strip metal is 175 pounds. Half the lubricant is 25 pounds. Half the part-time labor is 50 pounds. Labor, well, that's three lads at 100 pounds a week. And why still three lads with only half of 10 labor? Well, you can't just take on and lay off skilled lads like mine. They'd be off to someone else like a flash. I have to guarantee them their jobs. You mean they're staff? Well, I don't eat with them, obviously, but yeah. Yeah, staff, yes. Three at 100 pounds is 300 pounds, and overhead still 200 pounds. Which makes total expenditure? [MUMBLING] It is 750 pounds. Ooh, very nice. So 1,000 pounds take away 750 pounds is 500 pounds Precisely. What? 1,000 pounds take away 750 pounds? But I don't understand. I'm doing half the business, but I've only made here a quarter of the profit. It must be some mistake. Yes, there has been a mistake, all right, but not there. Look. You worked out that 10 cases, 2,000 pounds of sales, cost 1,000 pounds to produce and sell, and left 1,000 pound profit. Quite true. But let's look at those costs. 200 pounds overhead and marketing, 300 pounds for the lads, that's 500 pounds. And 500 pounds for the rest, 100 pounds for part time labor, 50 pounds for lubricants and so on, and 350 pounds for metal. But cut your turnover by half to 1,000 pounds, and see what happens. Overheads don't change, still 200 pounds. Staff costs don't change, still 300 pounds. The other costs, metal, lubricants, casual labor, they do change. They come down from 500 pounds to 250 pound. But it only leaves you 250 pounds profit. So that makes your cost per case look just a little bit different. If you're producing only five cases a week instead of 10, costs now take up 3/4 of the price of each case, 150 pounds, and profits are only a quarter, 50 pounds. But-- but-- but those are just accountants' figures. Ooh, certainly. And bank managers' figures, and receivers' figures, and judges' figures. Well, what is a decent, honest chap supposed to do? A decent, honest chap can start by separating his fixed costs from his variable costs. Remember we compared your forecast turnover of 2,000 pounds with your actual turnover of 1,000 pounds? Well, take a look at that costs. Some of them didn't change. Staff and overhead were the same whatever the turnover. They are fixed costs. The other costs only arose when you produced cutlery metal, and lubricants, and so on. They are variable costs. 500 pounds on 10 cases, 250 pounds on five, 50 pounds a case. So your variable costs are 50 pounds a case. Fascinating. He is telling me that I make 150 pounds profit on each case. That is not what I'm telling you. That is not what he is telling me. [CLEARS THROAT] What are you telling me? I am telling you that we are now in a position to look for the missing figure. What missing figure? The key figure for any new project, the one figure you have to know before you start. - Which is? - Which is-- what? The break-even figure. Look, you worked out that 10 cases gave you 1,000 profit. Now what's the maximum you can produce a week? 16, top whack. But how many do you have to sell just to stay in business? Nine. One? Five? - I don't know. - Oh. Not yet. But now we're in a position to work it out. Now we know that each case has a variable cost of 50 pounds. And 150 pound profit. - Not 150 pounds. - Not? How can it be profit if you haven't paid the rent, or paid the lads, or paid your heating bills? The fixed costs. - Ah. The 150 pounds that's left after paying the variable costs is a contribution towards those fixed costs. Once you've paid those, then it's a contribution towards profit. At the moment, all we know is that it's 150 pounds contribution. It's the value you and your lads have added to the metal and so on that you bought by turning it into cutlery. Your fixed costs were 500 pounds, remember? Well, you can think of them as a hole 500 pounds deep. Each case makes 150 pounds contribution to filling that hole. So two cases pay off 300 pounds of the fixed cost, three pay off 450 pounds, and with the fourth case, you pay off the last 50 pounds and make 100 pound profit. If you make a fifth case that week, then in that case, as a 150 contribution, is indeed profit, all of it. In fact, your break-even in that example is three and a third cases a week. You see? I knew it. Typical. Absolutely typical. - I beg your pardon? - Three and one third cases a week. I was producing five. I was making a profit. I'm a success. Excuse me, I must go and tell them. - Wait a minute. - What, what, what? I said in that example. There was something I left out of that example. Why? Because there are some minds that cannot take any more than one idea at a time, if that. What have we left out? Depreciation of fixed assets. Ah, of course. You understand depreciation? Obviously. How would you describe it? Uh, well, I'm not awfully good at the describing lark. But I'd be also interested to know how you made out. Thank you. Tell me, how much did you pay for all of your machines, cutters, dies, presses, and so on. Uh, 20,000 pounds, the whole of Aunt Agatha's legacy. And how long until you have to replace them? - Ages. Ages. - How long? Oh, a good five years. - And then you go out of business? - No, then I buy some more. - What with? - Profits? I suppose they're not enough. I suppose you've spent them on something else. Oh, all right. Tell me. Right, depreciation. You started with Aunt Agatha's legacy, 20,000 pounds, and you turned it into machine tools. But it was still worth 20,000 pounds. You just put it into machines instead of the bank. But as you use a machine, you start to use it up just as if you were spending the money. Each case of cutlery takes a tiny bit of the machine's value with it, as well as the strip metal. It's another cost of production. And after five years, the machine's whole value will be gone. You will have spent the whole machine. So part of your sales income has to be set against the invisible expenditure of machine value. And that's depreciation. [COINS CLANKING] It may look like money in the bank, but in five years' time, you're going to need all of it to replace your machines and stay in business. Using up 20,000 pounds over five years means using up 4,000 pounds a year. And you'll have to allow another thousand a year for rising prices because those machines won't still cost 20,000 pounds in five years' time. That means setting aside a total of 100 a week for depreciation. So that hole isn't 500 pounds deep. It's 600 pounds deep, which means that 100 pounds bit of contribution from the fourth case isn't profit after all. It's swallowed by depreciation. So your break-even is four cases, not three and a third. Their contribution has to pay for 200 pounds overhead, 300 pounds labor, and 100 pounds depreciation. 600 pounds of fixed costs, four contributions of 150 pounds each. So my break-even is four cases. - So it seems. Well then, what is all this bankruptcy charade it [INAUDIBLE]. I was turning out five cases. I'm laughing, aren't I? Apparently not. Uh, could there be anything you've forgotten? - No. - Good. Tell me how you started this fascinating business. Ah, what a story. All my own idea. Got a die maker, a prototype, market tests redesigned, wonderful publicity campaign. Look at that. Ads, mailshots, launched at a buffet lunch served exclusively with Carruthers Coupled Cutlery. Triumph, triumph. - When was all this? Oh, uh, just over 12 months ago. And how much did all these cost? Well, you don't spoil a ship for a ha'porth of tar. Oh, no, no. 25,000 pounds. And where did that come from? No, it's perfectly alright. I got a loan. - Interest rate? - 20%. - Security? - Machines, patents, trademarks. - Repayable when? - Just over 12 months. And how much have been repaid? Well, it's been a bit-- - Nothing? - Sort of nothing. - I see. - What do you see? I see why you aren't laughing. Look, we said your fixed costs were 200 pounds overhead, 300 pounds labor, and 100 pounds depreciation, right? Right. But 20% interest on 25,000 pounds is 5,000 pounds a year. That's a further 100 pounds a week. Then there's the loan itself, 25,000 pounds to repay after a year. That means setting aside 500 pounds a week for loan repayment, which means your fixed costs aren't 600 pounds. They're 1,200 pounds. And how many 150 pounds contributions is that? Uh, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. 8 contributions. So break-even is eight cases a week. And you are producing? Five. So you needed three more just to break even, four more if you wanted to make any profit. So what are you telling me I should have done? Produced a business plan based on a break-even figure worked out in advance. You mean just as you would have done? Yes. It's called marginal costing. Actually, there is another way. Total absorption costing. Oh, please don't-- don't confuse me with information. It's simple, really. Look, how much would it cost you to produce one case a week? Ah, I can do that. 1,200 pounds fixed cost, 50 pounds variable cost, 1,250 pounds. And if you produce two cases? What would they cost each? Simple, half of that, which is-- What about the variable costs on the second case? Ah, as I was saying, half 1,300 pounds, which is 650 pounds. - Three cases? - Well, a third of 1,300 uh, 1,350. And 3 into 13-- go 3 into-- - Four cases? - It's four of-- what? - Five cases? - Well, hang on. - Hang on, old chap. - Just a second. Don't worry. Notice, I've done it all for you, look. Five cases cost 290 pounds each to produce. Six comes downs to 250. Eight comes down to 200 pounds each, which is your break-even figure, remember? If you get up to 16, they're only costing you 125 pounds each. 75 pounds contribution per case? No, 75 pound profit. That 125 pounds has absorbed all your fixed costs already. So it has. 75 pounds profit, good lord. So if you want to use total absorption costing instead of marginal costing, you can plot it like this. No, it's a graph. I don't believe in graphs. Why not? Well, I don't understand them. Well, it's perfectly simple. It says the same thing in a different way. Look, that is the number of cases you sell a week, taking 16 as the practical capacity, and 4 to 16 as the relevant range. - Beg your pardon? - Never mind, never mind. That is the cost of producing each case. Production volume, production costs. - Very clever. But what does all that get you? Well, suppose you reckon you can sell 10 cases a week. You just read up the 10 line, and you will see that each case will cost you 170 pounds to produce. So you've got to charge more than 170 pounds a case to make a profit. If you charge less, you're in the red. Or you can do it the other way. If you reckon that 200 pounds a case is the most you can charge, just read along the 200 pounds line, and you will see you've got to produce at least eight cases to break even. Produce less, and you're in the red. But-- but if I had done that and found it was eight, this whole magnificent enterprise would never have started. I knew I couldn't guarantee selling eight a week. Yes, a business plan does stop people from starting up doomed projects, but it also gives you a chance to look at alternatives. - Could you have cut your variable costs? - Nope. - Used less labor? - Nope. - Charged more per case? - Not a hope. - Charged less per case? - Oh, brilliant. The man is a commercial genius, business brain of the century. You're going bankrupt, you must cut your profits? How many cases would you sell at 150 pounds each? - Oh, I'd sell a lot. - How many? 15 a week at least. - So? - Hm? What would 15 cost you each? Well, how should I know? But-- yes, but I've never driven one of these. That doesn't matter. Nobody is looking. But this thing can't be working properly. Why? Well, it says 130 pounds. I know. But that's 20 pounds cont-- 20 pounds profit per case. Right. - 15 cases? - Right. - 300 pounds profit a week? - Right. [LAUGHTER] - I'm rich. - No, you're not. You're bankrupt. I am a retrospective millionaire. The bankruptcy courts are full of retrospective millionaires. But-- but my idea works. If you are right about selling 15 cases 150 pounds each, and if you can actually produce 15 cases a week, and if you can still keep your fixed costs at 1,200 pounds, and if you can-- - Forget the trivialities. I was on to a good thing all along. You may have been on to a good thing at 150 pounds a case. Seems you're on to a bad thing at 200 pounds a case. But now that I know all about it-- Do you know all about it? Tell me. All right, I will. First, marginal costing. You divide your production costs into two different kinds. Fixed costs, the ones you have to pay whatever happens, and variable costs, the ones you only pay when you produce something. The difference between the variable cost of the product and the price you charge for it is the contribution, contribution to fixed cost until they're all paid up. When they are, that's your break-even figure. After that they are contribution to profit. Second, total-- total-- total-- Total absorption cost-- I know, I know. I was just getting around to it. Total absorption costing. That way, you take the total costs, fixed and variable, and divide them by all the different numbers you might sell. That enables you to work out a different unit cost figure for all the different volumes. You can even plot them on a graph, if you go into that sort of thing. With the graph, you can take a given volume and see what each unit would cost to produce, or you can take a given price and see how many units you need to produce to keep your costs down to it. Very good. Very good, indeed. 12 months too late, but very good all the same. And now, if you'll excuse me. - Well, where are you going? Oh, I've got a little business to sort out. Cutlery business. Lent them 25,000 pounds a year ago, good security, machines, patents, trademarks. Now they've gone bust. - Really? Why? Never worked their costs out, never had a business plan how to price their products. That was that. [LAUGHTER] Cheers. - Cheers. [LAUGHTER] Never worked their costs out. Ha, ha! [MACHINES RUNNING]
