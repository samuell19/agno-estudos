(dramatic music) (upbeat pop music) - All right. If you could choose anywhere in the world, where would you go and why? - That would be Greece. But, just long enough to fall in love and then we would move back here. - Dinner with one person, dead or alive. Who would it be? - That's easy. My dad. - In your wildest dreams, what does your life look like in 20 years? - In my wildest dreams, I would live with my handsome husband, Dimitri. - Ooh la la! - We'd have two, possibly three kids, and we'd live on a farm upstate. - Farm? You want to be a farmer? - I want to just have a lot of space for all the little kids and the dogs and chickens to run around. - Okay, Abby. (giggling) - Honey, tell me! - Stop! - Just tell me! - Stop and I'll tell you! I didn't send you my itinerary because I'm not coming. - What? - I'm sorry, it's just really bad timing. This has nothing to do with him, so don't even think that. It's just, it's my decision and-- - You've got to be fucking kidding me. (train rattling) - [Brad] This is Brad. Ha ha! I got you, sucker! Now, I'm probably doing something amazing in an exotic location and working on my tan. Yes, it is okay to be jealous. Either way, leave a message with my secretary and I'll see what I can do for you. (voicemail beeping) - 19 years! You're willing to throw 19 years of friendship out the window for him? - That's not fair. - People change, Abby, I get it. But, the person you've become is disgusting. - Would you take a look in a mirror, please? - [Brad] Yeah? Yeah? You like that, huh? Tell me how big I am! - You're huge! You're massive! (moaning ecstatically) - [Brad] Yeah? How much do you love my cock? - So much, baby! I want you to fuck me forever! (grunting) - Abby? Thanks for the cupcake, baby. That's so sweet. Abby, you knew that I needed this and-- - Are you kidding me? - Yes? (screaming) - Wow. - What the fuck? - What's your problem? (screaming) - Oh, my god! I'm so sorry! - My eyes! My eyes! - No, I'm not. I'm not sorry. (screaming) (static buzzing) (sobbing) - I don't know why I get so anxious about flying. This is a breeze. I always forget how good the scared-to-fly medicine is. (giggling) I think it might work better after you've had a drink or two. Note to Self: Always have a drink or two. (giggling) - [Man] You do that the whole flight? - No. (giggling) The medicine wore off and we're still up in the air. I had two more pills. They must have fallen out. I just find it really hard to breathe. I just don't know how there's enough oxygen in here for all of us. I feel like it's a metal coffin. (pounding) (flushing) I need another minute please? (gasping) (upbeat pop music) I think I'm standing in front of the royal family over there in the back and then, over here, look, look, look! Whoa! It's the castle! What? I think that's where they live. I'm not sure, though. (upbeat pop music) This is amazing! (upbeat pop music) This is the scariest thing I think I've ever done! (laughing) So, Penny told me that this place is crazy, but this is wilder than I ever would have imagined. I couldn't understand what the bartender was saying. I think I ordered a large. (giggling) - [Man] Excuse me, darling. You mind if me and my mates join you? - Oh, yeah, sure. - [Ben] What do we have here? Hey, wait, stop. Take this, take this, take it. - Oh, my god! Oh, my god! Wait! Did you see that? - [Jewel] Look behind you. - Runaway backpack? - How did you-- Thank you so much! - I always keep the camera rolling just in case. You cool with that? - What's it for? - [Ben] It's a documentary about backpackers and all the crazy shit they run into in paradise. - What do I have to do? - Nothing, just be yourself. - That's it? - Nothing more. (speaking foreign language) - [Jewel] He's asking you if you want a beer. - Oh, yeah. Just regular size only, please. - Right. - [Jewel] I know he can be a bit intimidating at first, but he's harmless, most of the time. - He really records everything? - Yeah. - Oh, my god. You should see this guy at the bar. He's got this scar on the back of his neck, something about a barracuda attack up at Gili T. - [Jewel] I should probably get us those beers. (suspenseful music) - [Abby] Okay, interesting. No time to tell me where she is, but Penny sends me a picture of her feet. - [Ben] Boo! - Geez, you scared me. - [Ben] You up for some island hopping? - What's this? - Phi Phi Le. One of the most beautiful islands in the country. You should come with us. - I haven't talked to Penny yet. - [Ben] This is what the lifestyle's all about, just picking up and going at a moment's notice. You said you hadn't decided where to meet her yet, right? This would be the perfect place. - I don't know. - Have you seen the movie, The Beach? - Yeah. - Come with us and you'll be standing on it in two days. - [Ben] Bus leaves tomorrow. - Do we have to swim there? - Only if you miss the boat. - Okay, yeah sure. - And so it begins. - [Ben] I think a celebration is in order. (upbeat pop music) - I miss Brad. I know it's dumb. I know I'm being an idiot, but he could really be sweet sometimes. This is pathetic. I am going to go check my email. (suspenseful music) (camera clicking and whirring) - [Penny] Please, stop. (sobbing) I'll do whatever you want. Please. (suspenseful music) - So, we've been traveling all day and all night and now we're on a boat to Phi Phi Le. Ben gave me one of these little pills for the trip. I'm pretty sure it's Valium. They both took one. Look. (lush orchestral music) - Are you filming them? - Kind of them, kind of us. I want a bunch of footage so I can make a video diary when I get back. Do you think they're still arguing about the price? - I did. I'm not so sure anymore. - Well, didn't the guy say it was just 15 bucks a night? - Ben's passion has a tendency to bleed into everything. - So, how long have you guys been traveling together? - On and off, for about six months. - How did you guys meet? - Chang Mai. Opium dens have a way of bringing people together. - The Frisbee king of Thailand! Did you miss me, little lady? (shrieking and giggling) - He's that Australian guy I was telling you about. Him and his buddies were talking about a place where you can blow up a cow with a bazooka. - [Ben] He looks like one of those guys. - That's a real thing? - [Ben] The more you pay, the bigger the animal. I wonder where he got the money for a cow? - I thought he was kidding. - It's Southeast Asia. For the right amount of money, you can get away with just about anything. Who are you? - What? - [Ben] I'll be right back. - Where are you going? - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. - Hi. - Looks like the boys have found themselves a new friend. - I think she helped me buy a bracelet in Bangkok. - I wouldn't doubt it. This country's a lot smaller than it seems. - Do they know how obvious they are? - What do you think? - [Abby] Safe to say, Penny is pissed off. This time, she sends me a coconut wearing an electric blue wig. No message, just another ridiculous picture. I wish she would just get over it. - [Penny] You're gonna want to see this one day. Tell me why. - I am not in the mood, okay? - [Penny] Why? Why! - Why? Okay, yeah, why. Why? Because you and me need to grow up. Because you and me are too old to be partying through third-world countries, okay? We have to settle down-- - [Penny] That's bullshit. That's exactly what we're supposed to be doing at the age of 23. - Look, I have a really good thing going here with Brad and I just wish, I wish you would be happy for me, okay? - [Penny] I can't believe you're doing this. - Okay, Pen, I've made my decision. I'm not coming. I'm sorry. - [Penny] Fine, whatever. (suspenseful music) - How much longer are you gonna hide the sheep? - Meaning what? - Meaning there's something on your mind all day. You wanna come out with it? - I have no idea what you're talking about. - You've got heaps of shit on your mind. It's obvious. - Well, it's personal, so ... - Shouldn't be. You're amongst fellow backpackers now. There's no point in keeping it all bottled up. - Nice try, Dale. - It's too bad, love. You came all the way to paradise to get stuck in your head. (lush exotic orchestral music) He's got this little lady. She's doing a damn near perfect impression of a Dyson on his willy, so he decides to turn things up a bit. That's when he discovers the little lady is, in fact, a little fella. (laughing) - I've heard this urban legend before. - Oh, bullshit, mate. My mate doesn't get angry. Instead, he takes the lady-boy out to a bar, gets him absolutely plastered and then takes him to a tattoo parlor. 200 Australian dollars later, a very strategic piece of artwork is in place. Between the lady-boy's shoulder blades, in such a way that it's very hard for him to see, it now reads "I have cock and balls." - Oh, you're kidding. - Not only am I not kidding, two days later I saw him walking down the beach, still trying to seduce the farang, which leads me to believe he doesn't know what it says on his back. - Where's your buddy now? - Probably back at Patong Beach. Turns out playing a little Russian Roulette with his pecker is one of his favorite new games. (ecstatic moaning) Oh, you like that? - Give it to me! - Naughtiness, naughtiness! You want it harder? (moaning) - Yeah, yeah! Oh! Oh! (groaning orgasmically) - Oh yeah, oh yeah. - [Jewel] What are you doing? - Hey! I wasn't-- We should go back to Ben. Now. Penny's arriving at the docks today, so I have to find out what time to meet her. I can't wait to hear about everything she's been up to. Huh, she sent me a video. (dramatic music) (gasping) - Hey, just start talking. Whatever you need to say will come out. - Something happened this morning. I went to the internet cafe to check my email. There's something I need to show you guys. - [Clown] If you go to the police, I will kill her. If you tell anybody you're traveling with, I will kill her. What I want from you is very simple. Keep having fun with your new friends. That's it. Nothing more. Please don't make me prove that I'm serious. - I'm so sorry I dragged you both into this, but I didn't know what else to do. - You know what this is, right? - What? - Penny's fine, Penny's fine. Have you ever seen that movie, The Game, with Michael Douglas? Really? Awesome movie. Anyway, it's about this guy who's priorities were so whacked that his brother hires these people to do this game on him. The game, it scares him straight. Makes him realize what's most important in life. Well, that's what this is. This is the game in real time. I mean, it's happening all over southeast Asia. It actually started right here in Thailand. You pay people some money and then they help your friend find their happy again. It's like, it's paradise juxtaposed with terror. It's a pretty good idea, actually. - I have no idea what you're talking about. - Of course you don't. Here, this should paint a clearer picture. - Please, I'm begging you. No, please! You don't want to do this! I'll do whatever you want! Please, no, please stop! (screaming) - [Woman] Why would you do this? - [Best Friend] You needed this. You know you needed this. - [Woman] I'm sorry. (applause) - See, I could show you three more of these from last week alone. - I don't understand. Why would Penny want to do something like this to me? - How were things back home? - Fuck you! Don't you dare turn this around on me. No, you know what? I feel sorry for you. - I guess things maybe weren't perfect. - Anything she might be angry about? - Maybe. - [Ben] Like what? - Like I didn't come with her. I stayed home to be with Brad. She's always telling me that I take my life way too seriously and that I'm not as much fun as I used to be. So, you're telling me that that video is supposed to help me take my life less seriously? - No, no, I'm saying that that video is an attempt at shocking you, yeah? It's an attempt at getting you out of your own way. - I came all the way to Thailand by myself. Why wouldn't that be enough? - It's your first time to a third world country. I mean, that's the pretty perfect opportunity for Penny to get her best friend back, am I right? Look, we've all heard the horror stories. We've seen the movies, how scary and crazy Thailand can be. Yeah, no doubt about it. And now, your best friend is supposedly kidnapped. That's pretty scary, am I right? - This is insane. - You know what's insane? A million hits, that's what's insane. - Are you sure? - I've been criss-crossing all over southeast Asia for two years. Believe me, if there was something like this going on in real life, I would know about it. - It makes sense. - The way I see it, hey. Chill out. Chill out, enjoy the ride. Play along. Then, at the end, you'll get to decide what you want your life to turn out like. - G'day, mates! I love to see people's faces when I say that. What's going on in here? - We're just hanging. - Seems kind of tense for just hanging. Oh, shit. I love those videos. They're fucking hilarious. I'd do it to one of my mates if I had the money. You still angry at me, love? - No. Sorry about earlier. - How's about you save your apology? Join me for a cold tinnie instead. We'll consider it dead fleas on a koala's ass. - Get out there and have some fun. Those were the instructions. - You bet your ass those were the instructions. Let's get plastered and make some bad decisions. Why the hell else would we be on this beautiful island? Come on, y'all. It's Dale Time! (suspenseful music) Last time I went to this bar, this hot little sheila splatter-painted my chest. Needless to say, we brought that party all the way back to her bungalow, if you know what I mean. (suspenseful music) (upbeat electronic dance music) - I have this horrible feeling in my stomach. I can't shake it. My mind has been racing all night. I feel like-- Excuse me? Did you put this underneath my door? In that room? There was-- Do you even understand me? (sighing) - Let everything just release and fill up your lungs. Exhaling completely, inhaling deeply. - [Abby] Hey, Ben, can I talk to you for a second? - I'm a bit busy. - Please? Now? - Karma's calling, Ben. - Speaking of karma, how's about I get some of what Benjamin's got? - This better be good. - [Clown] You have to ask yourself a very simple question. Was telling the filmmaker and his hippie sidekick a good idea? I'm not sure. But, you're sure as hell gonna find out. All three of you are now my pawns and Penny is your queen. If you refuse to play along, your queen dies and if you feel the need to tell anybody else, especially that Australian douchebag, not only will she die, but I will cut her into pieces and have them delivered to her family. Now, get packed. You are all due on the 11:30 to Koh Phangan. Once there, sit tight and await my next orders. And, if you should refuse ... (power saw revving) - How could they possibly know that I told you guys? - Not sure. Doesn't really matter now, does it? Got something on your mind? You know, if you do, you might want to say it now. - I'm down to help you out, but not if you're gonna be looking at me like that. - You still think it's a game? - How bad do you feel for telling us? - Of course, I feel bad. Okay, yeah, right, I get it. That's what they want, but this doesn't feel right. How can we find out for sure? - We can't. If it were that easy, they would have been out of business a long time ago. Plus, you shouldn't feel bad about telling us. No one's ever filmed it from this side before. - And what if it's real? - [Ben] I wish. - Trust me, Koh Phangan is a magical place. Nothing bad is going to happen to us there. - I'm not letting you go back to those crazy sex hippies. - They're yogis. You know that. Do you really want to use this as another opportunity to prove how ignorant you can be? - I'm not ignorant of shit. I saw it with my own eyes. - The visual and the spiritual are on two completely different planes of existence. - Don't give me that bullshit. - I'll go check on how the boats are running. - Jewel came here two days after her best friend died of cancer. She was looking for answers. Let's just say she ended up finding them in a very unique set of people. You should go get packed. (chuckling) It's pretty funny. These assholes wouldn't know talent if it were sucking on their balls. They would have got half the money if I'd have been approved for the grant and now they get nothing. (laughing) You know, it's pretty interesting considering the whole Penny thing, right? I'm talking to myself. Fuck 'em. I'm gonna get it done. I'll just do it my own way. - [Jewel] Everything all right? - Yeah. What's up? - [Jewel] Time to head for the boat. - All right. Let's do it. (suspenseful music) - Are you recording? - [Ben] Whenever you're ready. - Hello, Penny. I hope you're enjoying your vacation. I wanted to make this video for you so, just to let you know that I totally get what you're trying to do. You want me to see that my life is really good and that I need to quit being such a head case. I love you for trying to help me, but I just don't think that this is the best way to go about doing it. I think it may be having the reverse effect, actually, so I, can we just let this all be done now? I'm ready to have some fun with my best friend. We came to Koh Phangan, just like the guy in the creepy clown mask told us to, so I'm guessing you're somewhere nearby so come out, come out, wherever you are. I love you, Penny. Can we please just let this all be done with and go have some fun? - Done and done. Video is sent. We'll have a Penny to play with in no time. - I told you this island is filled with positive energy. - I'm down for a drink. Who's in? - I'm good. - Me too. - To each his own. - Did he tell you? - Tell me what? - He was denied for a film grant this morning. - That doesn't sound good. - It's not. A couple more weeks and he'll be out of money. Word to the wise? Stand back while he comes to terms. (suspenseful music) (grunting) (waves lapping gently) (suspenseful music) - Ignorance! It's always been ignorance! People never see what's sitting right in front of them. (laughing) I can't wait for the day when everybody sees how amazing my work is. (laughing) Best day of my fucking life. (sighing) Well, I'm gonna get more beer, okay? (suspenseful music) (heavy breathing) I really thought things would be different here. They're not. I'm just a failure. Like I've always been. (laughing) (sighing) See, this is what it looks like when dreams die. Smile baby Smile this morning Make the sweetest sigh Calling out to my dreams (camera clicking and whirring) - I came to get Ben for breakfast this morning and this is what I found. I really hope he was filming himself last night. (heavy metal music) (thunder rumbling) - I'm sorry, who gave this to you? (speaking foreign language) (thunder crashing) - Not exactly sure what happened last night, but I'm pretty sure death feels better than this. Fuck. - [Jewel] Can I get you some whiskey? - You're hilarious. - We got another letter. - What's it say? - It's the local guy at the restaurant. They want us to go on a hike. - And? - And they left a map for us to follow. There's no mention of the video that we made. I think it's time that we talk about our other options. - Meaning what? - Meaning I think we should go to the police, or the US Consulate-- - [Ben] Look, you might as well cut Penny's throat yourself. - You said this was just a game. - No, I said I thought this was a game. - Now you're changing your words. - You're focusing on the wrong things. If we want to protect Penny, we just keep playing. - Yeah and what if it is really some psychopath behind all of this and what if we go on this little hike and he decides this time to chop us all up into little pieces? - First of all, you have seen way too many horror films. Secondly, I know it's confusing but they were very clear about what they'd do if we go to anybody for help. Yeah, there's risk involved. We all know that, but fuck it. You know what? Life's just a piece of shit anyway. You need our help. Penny needs our help and I'm willing to stick it out til it's done. - I'm with Ben. I think we'll be fine if we stick together. (suspenseful music) - We're heading through Paradise Falls and I haven't seen a single person since we got here. (suspenseful music) Everybody needs me to keep from panicking, but I really feel like shit. I'm really getting tired of babysitting. We're about at the end of the map the guy gave us. I think we're really deep into the jungle here. - What are you doing? - [Ben] What? - Are you filming for your movie? - [Ben] No. - Jesus, Ben, can we just focus on this map and finding Penny for like, two seconds please? - [Ben] All right, calm down. - Your stupid fucking movie is really starting to piss me off. Let's go! - [Ben] What the fuck? (suspenseful music) - "Come out, come out, wherever you are. "Funny video. "I liked it very much. "Thank you. "Simple instructions for tonight: "Buckets, buckets and more buckets! "I can't handle all the tension. "Use the fliers as your guide and please, have some fun." - [Abby] What are buckets? - As in the drink. "Free buckets from 8:00 to 8:10, 9:20 to 9:30--" - [Abby] Why would they want us to go out and drink? I don't get it. - Wasn't that what Penny was always trying to get you to do? Loosen up and have some fun? - Does this honestly feel like an attempt at helping me find my happy place? - [Ben] Yeah, I don't think I can drink today. I promised God I wouldn't this morning. - The necklace. It's Penny's. - [Ben] How do you know? - I gave it to her before she left. There's blood on it. - Okay, all right. Everybody calm down. There's no way to know that it's real blood and how do we even know if it's Penny's? (explosion) (screaming) (dramatic music) - [Ben] It's just the doll! - Well, grown men are supposed to be able to fuck those things! How did it pop? - I don't claim to be an expert on sex dolls, but if everybody could just calm down-- - You keep telling me to stay calm, okay? This whole thing is insane! I'm allowed to be a little bit on edge. And you know what? It is really starting to piss me off how none of this seems to affect you. - What do you mean, none of this affects me? I'm just choosing to keep it together. - [Jewel] Abby? - [Ben] I don't need this shit today. (suspenseful music) Hello, ladies. - What are you so happy about? - Nothing. - Where have you been? We've been looking for you. - I know. I got some good footage of it. - What? - I needed some b-roll. - Look, Ben, I am getting really tired of you filming everything. - All right, enough. Guys, we've had this conversation already today, okay? - Exactly. Who's ready for some buckets? (dramatic music) (camera clicking and whirring) - Looky who I found. - Oh, what have you guys been up to? (echoing laughter) (suspenseful music) (heavy breathing) (dramatic music) (camera clicking and whirring) - Who are you looking for? - Abby. - I think she just went to the bathroom. - Yeah, she's fine. She'll be right back. - Pretty casual attitude considering everything that's been going on, don't you think? - What do you mean, everything that's been going on? - Nothing. - No, it's not nothing. - Yeah, I get it. You're upset. - What are you guys talking about? - Forget it. - So fucking dramatic. - Abby? Abigail? Abby! Abigail! Ben! - [Ben] Oh, shit. - Oh my god. Do you see that? Someone got her good. (laughing) - You need to go. You need to go. - [Tabitha] Relax! I'm not trying to hurt anyone's feelings. (laughing) - You know what? I'm glad you're having a good time but you need to leave now! - Fine. Uptight. Geez. - I need help. - [Clown] How was your night? Funny thing about alcohol. It dulls the senses, makes it really easy to sneak right by somebody and slip a little something in their drink if you want to. Too bad about your dad. Your mom looks like a nice lady, though. How is Ithaca this time of year? I've always wanted to visit. (screaming) (static buzzing) (knocking) - Who is it? - [Ben] It's Ben. - I think I was drugged last night. - Yeah, that makes three of us. Something I need you to see. - Somebody please help me. (whimpering) He won't let me go. He said if I try to escape, he's gonna kill my family. (sobbing) Please. - The bathroom. (suspenseful music) Whoa, whoa. What are you doing? What are you doing? - [Abby] I'm taking these to the police. We need help. - No, no, no, no. We can't, we can't. - [Abby] Bullshit. It's over. It's gone way too far. - So, even if it means Penny's life, you're done? - What do you suggest we do? - We keep fighting. We get her back. - No, no way. Not like this. - With a best friend like you-- - What the fuck is that supposed to mean? - I'm talking about Penny. - You don't even know Penny! - You know, which is odd, because I'm the only one who's looking out for her. - You're not looking out for Penny. You're looking out for you and yourself and your movie! Jesus! You don't give a shit about Penny! You were denied your grant so you have to go home. This is your last shot at getting whatever the fuck you think you need to finish your film. I know all about it, so let's just be clear about that. - Fuck you. - Oh, fuck me? It's not my fault that you don't have what you need. - Guys! - That's such bullshit. - Look! (suspenseful music) - "Ready to go to the police yet? "Sure would hate to have to kill Penny when "you're this close to getting her back. "And to think, all you would have to do is keep a clear head "and continue to play along. "Tonight, Full Moon Party Treasure Hunt. "Step One, hippie chick drinks a mushy shake "at Mushroom Mountain, five p.m. sharp. "Be there or I cut Penny into little squares." (suspenseful music) - I'll do whatever you need me to do. - Okay. Before this goes one step further, we are getting the fuck out of this hotel. (suspenseful music) (knocking) Ben? - Yeah, one second. - [Abby] Why is your room locked? - [Ben] Forget it. Let's go. - [Ben] As good as always? - Hope you guys are good without me for a while. (speaking foreign language) - Who gave that to you? Excuse me? - "Say 'I love Penny'?" (upbeat tropical music) Hi. I love Penny? - To drink? - Yeah, two beers please. Who gave this to you? (suspenseful music) I don't understand how doing any of this could actually help someone. - They break you down. The real you becomes very clear. - Eight p.m. sharp. What do you think would happen if we went earlier? - I'm down if you are. Abby, we are not leaving here without Penny. Know that. You were right, what you said earlier. I don't know her. When it comes to my film, it's not very casual but this is not about my film anymore. This is about not letting those fuckers push us around anymore. No more being on the bottom of the pile. Where'd Jewel go? (upbeat electronic music) - Ha! You guys have to try this! It feels amazing! (suspenseful music) (voices echoing) (suspenseful music) (gasping) (dramatic music) (retching) - [Abby] Oh, my god. Penny's gonna die. What is this shit? - [Ben] No, no, no. We have to keep it together, all right? - [Abby] Oh, god, how? Tabitha's dead. We're all gonna die! - [Ben] We're not gonna die, all right. Just let me think for a minute. - [Abby] What the fuck does it matter? - [Ben] This can't be real. - [Abby] She's already dead. I know it. - [Ben] You don't know that, all right? - We don't know anything. That is the point. - [Ben] Okay, the last time we saw Penny, she was alive, all right? We still have to believe that's true. - [Abby] I can't do this anymore! (sobbing) - [Ben] It's the only choice we've got. Do you really want to be the reason that your best friend gets killed? - [Abby] That is not fair. (sobbing) I didn't ask for any of this. I'm not the strong one. She is. (sobbing) - [Ben] Breathe, breathe, breathe. (suspenseful music) I fuckin' knew it. It's a fucking security camera. (suspenseful music) (upbeat electronic dance music) (screaming) (upbeat electronic dance music) (screaming) - What's wrong? - Where's Jewel? - She said she wanted to get some fresh air. - [Ben] Where'd she go? - I don't know. Out to the beach, I guess. Why? What's going on? - This was taped to our front door this morning. - What is it? - I'm not sure. It will be hard to watch. - Hi, Abby! It's me. I'm outside. I just wanted you to know that everything's much better today, so thank you. Thank you for playing along. I even got to take a shower today. I almost forgot. Happy Birthday Happy Birthday Whoop-Dee-Doo Whoop-Dee-Doo I've got a present I've got a present Just for you Just for you (static buzzing) - [Ben] Is today your birthday? - [Abby] Mm-hm. - There were other things in the envelope. Things I couldn't show Abby. Things that would push her over the edge. "Tell Jewel to watch her fucking mouth." Now, she's nowhere to be found. The real question is when to stop. How far is too far when you have a legitimate chance for the first time in your life? This ... (sighing) This is where it all ends. I can't show this to Abby. She'd go running for help. I can't. I'm too fucking close. I think this is Penny's. - I don't understand why you won't tell me what we're doing here. - [Ben] Because there's a lot of answers to that question that you don't want to hear. - I don't need you to play Daddy. (yogis chanting) (Jewel moaning ecstatically) - [Ben] God fucking damn it! - This was where my spirit told me I needed to be. - Who have you been talking to? - No one. - Well, whoever's playing this game with us thinks you have been. - What? - We got another video, one with a note and some very specific instructions for you to keep your fucking mouth shut. - I didn't know there was a note. - Trust me, there's some things you don't want to know. - That's not your decision to make. - What was on the video? - Well, it was Penny. She was outside. She was wearing a nice summer dress. Some very happy shit. - What else are you keeping from me? - Who have you been talking to? - No one. - [Ben] Then why does he think you have been? - I don't know. Maybe they saw me talking to Dale on the beach this morning. - Did you fuck him, too? - I was meditating. He stumbled up to me. He was still up from last night. We talked, but I didn't say anything. - You positive? - Yes. I wanted to, though. - [Ben] Why? How could that possibly help? - Let's face it, Ben. Things have gotten rather serious and if they continue to get any worse, I wouldn't mind having someone like Dale around. (chuckling) - I think telling Dale would be a very bad idea. - No, if we're telling anyone, it's gonna be the police. - That's an even worse idea. Telling the Thai police department you're caught up in a kidnapping and a murder? That usually doesn't go over very well. - We didn't do anything wrong. - You think that matters? The Thai police department is one of the most corrupt police departments in the world. Do you think they care who did what? - Well, then, maybe telling Dale isn't such a bad idea. - Have you been listening to anything I'm saying? - Then what do you suggest we do, Ben? - I don't know. (telephone ringing) When did you get a phone? - I didn't. - Let me see it. Hello? - [Clown] So happy to see you all together again. Two p.m. today, you three and Jewel's best friend, the Australian, are going to Namtok Beach. - I never said anything to Dale. He doesn't need to be a part of this. - [Clown] Dale. Good to know. He's not part of our game because he knows anything. He's part of our game because he looks like a lot of fun. - Will Penny be there? - [Penny] Abby, it's me. Please, keep doing whatever it is you've been doing. Things have been getting better. - Penny? Penny? - [Abby] Are you filming them? I asked you a question. - [Ben] Yeah, I am and you might as well save your breath because as long as I want to film things, that's exactly what I'm gonna do. What the fuck are you doing? (suspenseful music) (screaming) - [Ben] What? What is it? - It's nothing. I thought I saw something. - [Dale] Everything all right, love? - Mm-hm. Let's keep going. - [Dale] This is a nice little camera you've got here. The dynamic range on this little fella's amazing. - What now? - Maybe I should film you ladies getting sexy with the camera. - There's no one else here. - [Dale] How a little bit of that ethnic love for Dale's sexy-cam? - [Ben] Hold up! Holy shit! Y'all see this? Anybody else see what I see? - [Dale] There must be some other hikers around. - [Abby] Those are Penny's clothes. - [Dale] Penny? Another lovely lady? Never have too many of those around. I may not be an expert, but I'd say that looks like blood to me. - [Ben] Yeah, we know. - What do you mean, you know? You expected some weird shit like this? - He deserves to know. - [Dale] I don't like the sound of that. - If we tell him, she dies. - [Dale] I really don't like the sound of that. - [Jewel] He's involved now. - Actually, you know what? Maybe I am best left in the dark on this one. (dart popping) - [Dale] Ow! - [Abby] What is it? - It's a fucking tranq dart! (dart popping) (Jewels screams) - [Abby] They're coming from the jungle! (darts popping) - [Ben] Ow! Fuck! (suspenseful music) (crickets chirping) (waves lapping gently) (groaning) (birds screeching) - I don't know if I'm gonna make it out of here. (whimpering) It's so dark and I keep losing the trail and my battery's almost dead. (sniffling) If you find this and I'm gone, (sobbing) please tell Penny Sanderson's parents of Troy, New York that I did everything I could to save her and please tell my mom, (sobbing) Jane Ferris of Albany, New York, that I'm so sorry that this happened. (sniffling) That I really wanted to make her proud someday, that I love her. (sobbing) (dramatic music) Why are you doing this? (birds twittering) (church bells chiming) - [Clown] You run, she dies. They all die. (whimpering) (static crackling) - Dale? - What the fuck is going on? I just woke up in a god damned pile of garbage with the key to this room taped to my fucking chest. - I don't know what happened. - Are you three playing games with me? Is this part of Benjamin's movie or something? - No. - Where the fuck is everybody? - Please calm down. I can explain. - [Dale] I want some fucking answers! So, you're telling me, I'm either on one of those internet videos where a psychopath has abducted everybody? - No, I'm telling you that we all thought it could have been one of those videos but, after everything that's happened, I don't see how that's possible. - [Dale] That's the point, darlin'. Hell, I saw a video where they abducted a guy and locked him in a coffin for two days. It's whatever it takes to break you down. - I feel like I'm going insane. - This is Thailand, love. Everybody's a bit insane. How's about this? I'll head on into town and do a little just-in-case shopping. - Just-in-case shopping? - Oh, that's the best kind. (dogs barking) Winner, winner, chicken dinner. Stopped by my unit and got you some clothes, love. Just-in-case shopping. (chuckling) You think they're filming us now? (telephone ringing) Hello? This is Dale, mate. You think you're funny? All right. Now, how's about you shut your fucking mouth. First things first, we want proof that everyone is okay. Until you satisfy this requirement, we will not entertain any of your requests. Well, it looks like you've got some work to do, then. You best watch that tone of yours. There's a shitstorm a-brewing. You do not want it coming down on your head. That is right, mate, and you best keep in mind that I'm not like these little sheilas you've been pushing around. I'm the real deal and I will break you the fuck down. As far as I can see, you've got two options. You either get me the proof I've so cordially requested or you confront me face to face. I look forward to it. - Have you lost your fucking mind? - Oh, calm down, love. Just rattling the cage a little bit. - He's going to kill all of them! - Listen, if he really is a psychopath, I'm betting I'm the one he wants to kill now and there is one thing I can guarantee you, a walk down Thunder Road with Dale is no kind of picnic. What do you say we go get ourselves a couple of cold tinnies? (upbeat electronic music) - Hey, can I ask you a question? - I'm not really in the mood. - How's Penny? - What can we do for you, mate? - Do you know where she is? Tell me! - Calm down, love, calm down. Have a seat. - Chill your chick out, man. - What do you know about Penny? - Some chick in a trucker hat asked me to do it. - A chick? (telephone ringing) - Dale? The phone! - Tell me about this chick. - Dale? - She was wearing a trucker hat and that's it. That's all I know. - Phone? - Give me the phone, love. Hello? I believe there's a matter of proof to be dealt with first. He hung up on Dale. - So what's the-- - It's time to take a walk, bro. - You got it. - We got somewhere to be, love. Get your beer. (suspenseful music) - Dale came up with a ridiculous plan that he thinks is going to make him look like a hero, so it's obvious that he still thinks it's one of those internet videos. I can't do this. I keep asking myself what would Penny do if she were in my place. I know exactly what she'd do. She's always been a strong-- (screaming) (dramatic music) No, no, no, no, no. (dramatic music) (screaming) My camera died last night. I thought I found a safe place to sleep but I woke up in this new location, with my camera fully charged, in this ridiculous fucking outfit. I'm just about tired of being made fun of. (distant heavy metal music) (hard-driving heavy metal music) (screaming) (screaming) (whimpering) (power saw revving) (screaming) (heavy metal music) (screaming) (sobbing) - Ladies and gentlemen! It is my profound pleasure to introduce to you, Miss Tabitha Humphries! ("Babygirl" by Rockapella) Babygirl Let me wrap these arms around you Babygirl Like you wrap my heart Around your every move Let me cradle you tonight Babygirl Babygirl Now I said words don't come easy In my world But you opened up a door to someplace new There's a wonderland inside And all I'm feeling I can't hide Say I'm the love of your life I ain't afraid to say I'd die Without you Tell me you're mine from tonight It's clear to me That I will always love you Always Say to me Baby girl Oh, Baby girl Baby girl Baby girl - [Both] You've gotta take the good with the bad, smile with the sad, love what you got, remember what you had, always forgive but never forget, learn from mistakes but never regret. - I love you, Abby. - Love you, too. (upbeat jazzy polka-style music) - Excuse me, this seat taken? - [Woman] No, sit down. - I'm John. Pleasure to meet you. - [Woman] Emily Tull. - Who knew Austria could be so pretty, right? (upbeat jazzy polka-style music)
