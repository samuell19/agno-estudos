What did you eat this morning? Water lilies. Okay, that's good. Hello? Hello? You can sit down. I have a few questions before we begin. How many weeks are you? Eight. Your general health is good? You're not taking any medications, drugs, antidepressants? No. What's the situation with the father? What do you mean? Well, is he in the picture or not? Does he know about the pregnancy? Yes, we've been trying for a long time to have… I don't want details, I just want to know if he'll cause trouble after and notify the authorities. No. He doesn't know I'm here. He can't know. He was always pro-life, even before they passed the law. No. No. Your husband isn't pro-life. He's "anti-abortion." Give me your coat. I was told you could tell me how to make it look like a miscarriage? There's a protocol, I'll explain everything after. Eight weeks, you're sure? Mm-hmm. When was your last menstruation? January 12. My belly just grew quickly. You can take off your underwear. -You mustn't get cold. -Thanks. Any allergies to medications? No. It'll be cold for a second. Good. Tell me when, Benji? It's a go in thirty seconds. This will help you relax. Okay. It's done. -What's that? -Get up. -Now? -Yes! Your papers please. Yes, sir. I can't get caught. My husband… Forget your husband! You want to do ten years in prison? Shh! Do you have a permit to drive here? Yes. Open the back door, please. Okay. You can close up. Thanks. Are you okay? Benji, I'm starting now. 10-4. You have ten minutes. Okay. Just relax. Slowly... There we go. Okay. Now I'll begin the suction. I know it isn't comfortable, but try not to move, okay? I'm sorry, dear. Breathe. Okay? Shit. Gently, gently… What… Oh, shit. What's wrong? You're not at eight weeks, huh? Yes. Don't stop. Don't stop, please, please. Here, put this under your tongue. I'm at eight weeks, I promise I'm at eight weeks. Now listen to me carefully. You need to tell me the truth, because if you're past your first trimester, you don't need suction curettage, you need an extraction. And if I don't act quickly, it will go downhill fast. You could die, do you understand? How many weeks? How many weeks? Do you want me to leave you on the side of the road? Fourteen. Damn it, fourteen. Benji, you need to give me more time. She's in her second trimester, and she's hemorrhaging. Fuck. What do we do? We change the itinerary. Drive as long as you can. Okay, but we're going to miss the next pick-up. I'll pay, tell him I'll pay. It's all right, she'll pay double. 10-4. I can't believe I'm fighting for women who won't even help themselves. If something happens to you, I'm the one who'll spend her life in prison. Do you understand that? Do you realize that? You've put us all at risk. I'm sorry, but you wouldn't have taken me at fourteen weeks. That's right. There's a reason I wouldn't have taken you at fourteen weeks. I couldn't, I couldn't keep it… I couldn't keep it, it had a birth defect… I would have had it in my womb for nine months and it would have died in my arms. I couldn't. I'll have to use forceps. Do you understand, I'm sorry, I didn't want to get you in trouble, but my husband, he wouldn't have understood, do you understand? Do you understand? If you get a fever, you need to see a doctor, because it could be a sign of infection. Tell them you had a miscarriage. Don't give them details, they won't ask any questions. They'll give you antibiotics. No sexual activity, and don't insert anything in your vagina for at least seven days. Very important. We do what we can in life. You understand? I can't… Yes, you can. You have no choice, it has to be done. My love, where were you? With my sister. Weren't you supposed to stay here today? Are you okay? I'm just a bit nauseous. Thanks. I thought that was over. I just had a big day. I have to go to the bathroom. Jacob? Jacob?
