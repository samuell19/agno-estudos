We were on our way to Panama. With the right kind of luck, I figured we were only two days from the canal. I was beat. In fact, I was already wishing I had never taken the job. My crew always wanted to sail, but the heavy demands of nonstop partying had taken their toll, on all of us. The only passenger I had who knew their way around a sailboat was Amy, the owner's daughter. I used to call her Princess and little rich bitch. But she was actually a lot of help. She even used to do the diving when there was any underwater work to be done. One of her friends said she was some kind of a swim champ in college. Of course, she should've known better than to try to get the drop on an old ex-marine. Sarge, it's Mel! But that was before I taught her anything about sneak attack. You know I could have you fired for that? Next time, don't make so much noise, airhead. Look Amy, sarge is just pissed off 'cause we damn near lost the boat last night in a storm. Some of us were... They weren't a bad bunch of kids, really. There was Jeff, he was Amy's main squeeze. Boe, a baseball player, Larry the runt. Amy's cousin Trevor had brought along his latest bombshell stewardess, Monique. Buffy was a cute kid. Big Tom was the clown. Just a bunch of college kids having a ball on their summer vacation. And yours truly getting paid to babysit while they played. I don't know to this day whether somebody left that dingy loose or it just drifted. Everybody's memory seems a little dim on that point. The rope off. I saw one in there a minute ago. Yeah, it was a big white one about the size... Whichever it was, I got mad and ended up going after it myself. And that was when they went and did something really dumb. What the hell do you think you're doing? Hey! We'll miss you! Buh-bye! Flood it. Here's your rations, sarge! Damn, his platoon gave him that when he retired. We'll miss you! quit screwin' around! Say cheese, sarge! Bye! Jerk-offs, come on! I'm warning you, if anything happens to that boat. Love you, sarge! They made it back to anchor okay. They were just screwin' around, not a care in the world. They had their little adventure. Me? I was working my way down the coast, worried sick about the boat. Must be nice to be so rich. It has its advantages. Land ho! What they didn't know, what nobody knew, was that the fun was just about over. Tom, are you okay? Tom, Tom, are you okay? - Ames, Buffy? - Oh, god, he's bleeding. Tom's hurt! Hey, what happened? You big jerk, you were fooling around, now look what happened. Look, just relax, relax, would ya? I can handle this, the airline taught me first aid. Tom? Oh god, I'm sorry, this is all my fault, I shouldn't have taken the boat. Look, look, let's just see what we got here, all right? Oh, I don't know, man, this cut's pretty deep. Look at his eyes. What? It looks like a concussion. I've seen it too many times in football. So what do we do? Sarge would know. Well sarge isn't here. Well where is here, anyway? Central America, that's all I know, central America. Well, I say we wait for sarge. You know, put his feet up or something. Shit. No, we gotta get him to a doctor. Let's get the lifeboat out. I think if I have this right, there should be a road about a mile in. How many should go? Boe and Larry are absolutely shitfaced. I couldn't even wake 'em up. My good old roommates. Always there when you need 'em. Well, this guy weights a ton, and he's not exactly gonna be tap dancing. We'll all help. Someone should stay with the boat. Fine, then you stay, Trevor. But you turn the running lights on and make sure that you tell sarge what happened. Fine. Just don't get lost, okay? Stop! Please help! Do you speak English? We're American, we had accident on boat. Americans? Sì, sì, he needs a doctor, he's got a concussion. Sì. I am father Esparza. You can come with me, please. Great. Here. There is a clinic, 20 kilometers maybe. I can take you there, it's near the mission. Thank you so much. Is that where you were going? No, I'm just taking these people behind you to a place nearby. They are something special. They are farmers on their way to their new land. Their own country is blocking land reform here. These people are now entitled to make a claim on their own land. Such a perfect vacation. My father me his yacht for two months. We had a really great time. We were heading toward the Panama canal. And this had to happen. Let us hope it is not serious. No! No, don't shoot, we're Americans! Americana? Sì, sì. Gringa. Oh, god, Jeff. ♪ Home, home on the range ♪ Shut the hell up in there, okay? ♪ Where is seldom is heard ♪ Sarge? You have a broken neck, huh? Huh, you have a good time, huh? Now, where are the others? Larry and boe are down in the hole. No, I can hear them a fuckin' mile away. Where are the others? Tom got hurt, they took him ashore. - In there? - Yeah. Amy said she'd send somebody back before dark. Jesus H. Christ. In there? Come on, come on! You piss off, buster. You want your tits for yourself? I will put them in a box for you. Cut it out! Amy, just shut up. No, we're Americans, god damn you! Shoot her. You would like a cigarette? I'd like for my friends and I to please get outta here. Señorita, you and your friends, you're Americans? Yes, and one of us is in need of a doctor, he's badly hurt. Who knows you're here? No one. How badly do you want to get your friend to a doctor? Badly enough. Don't worry. I don't hit. I merely give orders. You will find there are worse things than my bed. Take it off. Take it off, dammit. It always amuses me. You Americans act so big. Yet you are nothing. Father. What did they do to you? You must get away. Or they will kill you. Why? Who are they? Death squad. Monique. Oh man. Guard! Guard, please! He's dead, for god's sakes, please, please do something, you can't leave him in here. Dead? Don't go! Please, come back! Guard! Pedro! Pedro. Pedro, amigo! Pedro! Pedro! Pedro? Uno. Dos. Tres. Hey, hold it, will ya? Can you give me a ride? I just need a ride. Please see it, sarge, please, please, please, please see it, sarge. Thanks a lot, you scumbags. All right, Amy. All right. Oh, yo. Hey, ho, ho, ho. Take her. Welcome to banana land, Princess. Can you still run? Mm-hmm. I want you to go all the way to that clearing. Stand still, put your arms over your head like you're gonna surrender, you understand? You want me to stand there with my hands... Do it or you're dead. Hey. We gotta go back and get the others. Hey, there is no going back, Amy, you understand? It's time to save your own ass, come on. Look, it was an accident that could happen to anybody. Where were you while all this was going on? Why weren't you with them? That was what he was hired for, wasn't it, to... Look, there was a lot of confusion. Actually, we left him behind kind of like a joke. Amy. You don't have to cover for him. The man's a coward. Dad, he saved my life. If he'd have been doing his job, your life would never have been in danger. You know, I pay you to be responsible for that yacht and everyone on it. I know what you pay me fore. That all you got to say for yourself? No. I'm gonna tell you what you can do with your boat. You can shove it up your rich ass, Jack. You son of a bitch. You know I've had it up to here with you. You're fired! Fine with me. Daddy! Amy? Amy! Well, before any more fireworks start, let me tell you where we stand at this point. We don't know who's holding them, but ambassador Bartholomew should be meeting with president Lopez today. Thank you for coming. I full understand your country's concern over this matter. I assure you that my own is no less. As a mother, I think I know what those poor parents must be feeling. These rebels must be stopped. They undermine the trust between us. Our two countries have been friends ever since my Juan brought democracy to Costa Verde. We must help each other whenever we can. Well, if you're hinting about that request for aid, we will do all we can, I can assure you. I have put my best man in charge. Ah, speak of the devil. Colonel? Mr. ambassador, this is my chief of internal security, colonel Perez. Colonel. Ah yes, you were Virginia military, weren't you? That is right, sir. How did you know? Oh, well I make it my business to be familiar with all the key people around here. Is there any news? Nothing yet, Señora Presidente. Well let me know if I can be of any further assistance. Yes, certainly, Wade. Thank you. Colonel. - Mr. ambassador. - Very nice meeting you, sir. Well? As far as we can tell, the Americans were taken by leftist elements. Who we don't know yet. Nor what they intend to do with them. This is bad for us. Very bad. And the timing couldn't be worse. Just when I'm courting the American congress for more aid, and the elections are upon us. We must get those children back. I understand, Señora Presidente. You can rely on me. In Los Angeles, the outlook for today is clear skies. The high for downtown will be in the 80s and drop into the low 60s. William's bringing you some chicken broth. Mother, really? Now eat it. One bowl of chicken broth, madam. And one ultra bad Maui Zaui. What do you say? I think I'd only get paranoid. But thanks anyways. Hey, what did they do to you down there? It was really awful. It's okay. You got the right to get as crazy as anybody. Whatever you decide to do, I'm with you all the way. Where is she, you son of a bitch? No! Amy, och Amy, honey, oh. Mom. It's all right, honey. It's just another nightmare. I was back in that hole. I know, darling, I know, it was just a bad dream. Oh mom, they're gonna die. I know they're gonna die, we gotta do something. Baby, there's nothing more we can do. The state department's working on it, your father's lawyer's looking into it, and we've even spoken with amnesty international. Come on, out. Come on. Daddy, can I talk to you for a minute? Oh, sure, honey. I need to ask a big favor from you. Okay. Well, I'll do my best. What? Well, you know how I'm so concerned about my friends and all? Ah, yeah. Well, we're all concerned, honey. Yeah, but what's being done about it? The rebels are demanding $3 million, and the government refuses to even negotiate. Look baby, you've gotta understand. The United States government would set a very bad precedent if they just give in like that. Besides, I'll bet they're doing a lot more than we know about. Yeah. I bet. I think it's time for action. Action? What if I knew some, you know, military types who'd be willing to go down there and get the kids for a price? You'd pay for it, wouldn't you? Absolutely not. Why not? It's illegal. You can't take armed men into some foreign country. You oughta realize that. - But daddy. - No buts, young lady. Now look, I'm putting my faith in the United States government, and you'd be well-advised to do the same. I mean, they had 15 guys, heavily armed, M16's, everything, the whole shit. What did they expect me to do? I got her out, didn't [? You know, I knew this dude that drank two bottles of whiskey in one hour and was still standing. Shit, I can do that. I know, he was you. Remember caisson and you getting the chopper to medivac me out? Mm-hmm. And in the middle of a mortar barrage, you get out of the chopper and you take a piss. Well, you had to show the bastards that you ain't scared. Right? Thank you very much. Buck. This is the little Princess that put me back on the fishing boats. Buck, Amy. Sarge, the government's not doing anything. They're gonna stay down there, I just know it. Well, that doesn't surprise me. But I feel responsible. Yeah, that doesn't surprise me either. So I'm willing to risk my life and get them out. Now that surprises me. I mean, you're not thinking what I think you're thinkin'. I think she's thinkin' what you think she's thinkin'. Sarge, somebody's gotta go down there and do it, - it might as well be me. - Are you crazy? To go back down there to that country? Got to admit the girl's got heart. No brains. Sarge look, I know that it was my fault. No. No you don't know. You don't know anything. You got 50, $100,000 to throw on this crapshoot? - Do you have it? - No. No. You got trained men that you can trust? In a life-death situation, do ya? No. I don't. You got weapons, you got an airplane, you got ammo, you got anything, got any kinda plan? I don't have anything. Can you kill another human being? I don't know. No, well then you're a little rich bitch from Beverly hill... She just slap me there? Yeah, she just slapped you there. I'm sorry. Buck's got an airplane. You get 15 men, and no less than $50,000, can you do that? Six men and $30,000. Take a hike. Look, it's all I have to offer. You find two guys as crazy as me and him? Caisson, caisson. Beverly hills hotel, may I help you? Yes, one moment, reservations will be right with you. Your drink, sir. Waiter, over here, please. Ames. Trevor, I have got the greatest idea. We're gonna go down there and get them out ourselves. What, me go down there again? No no, who do you think I am, Clint fucking Eastwood? No. Trevor, they're your friends. - Well sure, but... - Think about Monique. Monique. Well, yeah, sure, but... I'll give you half my inheritance. No. The papers are already signed. Monique? Half your inheritance. Well, it's a damn dirty job you're asking me to do, Amy. But somebody's gotta teach those bastards a lesson. Let's get your rear in gear, it's action time. Hmm, the lord helps those that help themselves. Okay, head for boe and Larry's apartment first. You go down sunset past the freeway, I'll tell you when to turn. Ace is doing it, even Trevor's doing it. I want you to pretend this is the guy that held us hostage down there. I gotta tell you, Amy. My shrink doesn't like me doing psychodrama with anybody but her. This is a watermelon. Would you just pretend, boe? I want you to pretend that this is the guy that humiliated me, that spit on Buffy, that felt up Monique, that hit Jeff over the head with a rifle while you guys were drunk outta your brains. Whoa, time out, time out. Welcome aboard, gentlemen. All right, now we just gotta get a chunk of cash quick. How you gonna do that without your dad? Just take a ride in daddy's car. Your dad's gonna kill you for this one. Where do we find a good fence, Ace? I suppose you think that because I'm black, I'm supposed to know where all the good fences are and that kinda stuff. Well, don't you? That's a typical misconception of people of color. I'm studying to be a surgeon. We're not all born criminals. Let's go, let's git. All right, so where is he? Hey. You had somebody fooling with that left front Fender, didn't you? That's gonna cost you. Hey Amy, this is Freddie the... Freddie the fence. Listen, I want cash, I want $30,000. Oh! What is it, April first or what? Blue book's 20. Freddie's book's 10. Then we take off for the Bondo right front. The spot things on the grill. The bald rear tires. The busted right rear shock. I say five grand. $5000? 25. Look, maybe I can do 10, maybe. Look, 15's bottom. All right, all right, let's not quibble. 15 grand. All counted. Say, I'll give you $500 for the Rolex. This is a $3000 watch! Well, what can I tell ya, sweetheart? You want it or not? Okay. Hey, can I call you guys a cab? Get the hell outta here. I don't know. If we don't get some help soon, I'm afraid he ain't gonna make it, you know? It's gonna happen soon. They're gonna make it. Those bastards killed Amy. Who's next? Come on, you guys. Run. Take a break. Where's the a-team when you need 'em? Okay. We have the money, we certainly have the will, now what we need is sarge. Let's go talk him into it. Wait. Let's let him have the day to drink, and then the idea of us being his recruits won't seem so... - Ridiculous? - Inventive. Insane? All right, good. I need a couple pizzas and a case of Bud anyway. Yeah, excellent suggestion, you fat slob. Best idea all day. I'm gonna go ahead, I'm gonna run an easy mile and then I'll head home. There's no such thing as an easy mile, Ames. Tell Ace he's gotta go twice as far tomorrow. God. (Solemn music You killed a guy? He would've killed me. Look, I got five volunteers, I got $15,000, we're in business. No, we are not in business. I told you 15 trained men, $50,000, you bring me four boys and a chick. All I got is a bunch of toy soldiers. Sarge, I think you better take a look at this. Oh,. Tom's body was found in a garbage can outside the U.S. embassy. Rebels are demanding $3 million, or they're gonna kill everyone else by July 4th. That's a day and a half from now. Damn! What we gonna do, sarge? Look, one thing's for sure, we have no time for training. You know, they'll be dad in 36 hours. What do you mean no training? Just jump on a plane and go down there and rescue them? You got it, son. Listen sarge, we got one decisive advantage. Surprise. They don't expect you to return. You're right, you snake. Okay. Anybody want out, say it now. We go. Okay. Let's get busy, we leave in the morning. Did you get it? All right. How do we turn that into our ticket outta here? Just watch. Where's dipshit? Trevor? He had to run home for something. He'll be back soon. Sure. Trevor. Thought you were down on the beach with Amy. You haven't seen that crazy William, have you? I think he stole my car. Uncle Brad, I think there's something you should know. Come on, guys, let's go, come on. Come on, easy. Hey, what we gonna do, throw rocks at 'em? What the he's in there anyway? That's my secret weapon, Ace. Give me the guns. Hey, we go in five, whether Trevor's here or not. You got it, bro. - They can't be serious. - You don't know my daughter. Or that goddamn sergeant Ford, either. Okay, scratch Trevor, we're going, buck. This is the 123 requesting permission to take over. 123, clear for immediate takeoff, runway one. Right. Hang on, gang, we're about to go. I know where Trevor was. 123, abort takeoff. Repeat, abort takeoff. No way, Jose. Here we go. Jesus. What's that damn fool trying to do? , huh sarge? I sure as hell hope not. Damn! Dear madam president. I regret to inform you we expect several U.S. citizens to attempt unauthorized rescue of hostages tonight. Please intercept and take into protective custody. Respectfully, Wilson Sumner, department of state, United States of America. It arrived about an hour ago. I thought you should know. The last thing we need is to have another American killed, especially now that they've agreed to pay the ransom. Don't worry, Señora Presidente. I'll place guards in all potential landing strips. We'll find them, and keep them safe as babies in their mothers' arms. I'm counting on you, Perez. Those guys are no fools. They gotta camp in the high plateau, heavily guarded. Mountains to the north, to the east. They got a river here on west, cliffs to the south. And they got one road. Only one road in here, and you can bet your sweet ass it is heavily guarded. Now tomorrow, the executions begin at dawn. So that means we got one chance, only one chance to get in and out. 2400 hours is our drop time. What time? 12:00 midnight to you. When we go in there, buck is gonna go very high. Sarge, how high is high? High is 10,000 feet. And you freefall to about 1500 feet and your chute'll open automatically. 8500 feet freefall, straight down? Now you got it. Look, just think of it as riding on a roller coaster smashed on acid. I guess I can dig that. Okay. You're gonna head here, you're gonna regroup here, then you're gonna move on into the camp, and that is when our nutty professor here - will create his... - Diversion. Now you got it, right. And that's when you're gonna get in there and you're gonna grab those kids and... And blow those suckers away! No no no no. No, it's not about your people, it's about getting away. Let me tell you, you stop, and five of these guys, and they'll blow you away, believe me. You gotta keep on moving, you gotta keep on moving, you never stop moving. And that means if you have to leave somebody behind, you leave 'em behind, you keep on moving. You got it? 'Cause we gotta be outta here before sunrise, or we're dead. And what are you gonna be doing? Me and buck will be busy, okay? If it should happen that your parachute doesn't open, which can happen, I want you to save it and return it, 'cause we got a five-day guarantee. Before things get too sticky, we wanted to give you this to replace the one that we lost. It's full. Enjoy, gringos. It's your last meal. You mean you're letting us go? Suit yourself, gringo. Hey Pedro. There's no reason to kill us all, is there? I mean, you open that door and I'll take you around the world, but it won't be with pan am. I mean let me outta here and I'll toot your root till your balls turn blue, huh, yeah? Ooh. Can't believe she's selling us out. Let's go. Three million U.S. dollars, as promised. Now lieutenant Caden will go with the colonel to make the rendezvous. I don't think that would be wise. The rebels have put strict limits on the number of men they can bring to the exchange. Nevertheless, we consider it would be prudent to have our representative along, if only to observe. - But... - Colonel. You will take the lieutenant with you. I'm sure he can only be of help. Of course, Señora Presidente. Just pull out to fire. And that for safety. Not too difficult, huh? Is that all there is to it? I thought it was more complicated than that. Nah. They made killin' real simple. It's dying they haven't figured out how to make easy. Okay. All set? Yeah. No heroics now. We have to be back to the plane by first light or we're finished, you understand? Drop zone comin' up. Okay. Go. What are we gonna do about Monique? She may be dead already. Amy never came back from the hole. Look, just worry about gettin' outta here first. Then we'll find a way, okay? Colonel, how long before we reach the rendezvous? 15 to 20 minutes at the most. In the middle of a goddamn village. You see a village on the map? Did you see a village on the map? - Shh. - No village on the map. They're all blank. Where's Amy? Where's Amy?! I don't know, I thought she was following me! Spread out, look for her five minutes, then we go. Let's go! All right. Hey, I'm gonna see if I can find the bathroom. Don't get lost. Hurry back, I need help with this stuff. Oh shit. Where are the others? Others, what others? This is my solo flight, bro. What kind of English is that? English? That's not English, that's Chinese. This is Chinese tea. Would you like to have a little tea with me? Be my guest, huh? Man. This is your way of gettin' back to the motherland, - I don't like it. - Shut up. Where the hell are we, anyway? We'll get there, don't worry. Look! Amy. Get me down from here. Why didn't you say something? Come on. For the last time, where are the others? For the last time, I don't know where the others are. Juan! Oh! Are you hit? No. I peed in my pants, man. Took you so long? Out scoutin', lets' go. Batter up? You know how to put the thing together, right? Sure. Weren't you listening to sarge? I was thinking about the fact that pretty soon, I'm gonna have to jump out of a plane like some guy that's lost his marbles or something. Shit. This thing's made in Japan, you realize that? "Please to put piece eight inside plain," the rest must be in the next part. Oh, shit. Look, I'm gonna get started on the truck. Don't blow yourself up. I wanna go home. Sarge. Where we going? Back to the plane. I wanna get my secret weapon, then we'll go huntin'. You know how to hot-wire a car? Do I know, you're the one who's supposed to know about this. Just because I'm black don't mean I'm supposed to know how to hot-wire a car. Hey look, I'm studying to be a surgeon. So then you don't know how to do this. I didn't say that. I'll figure it out. I'm smart. Now if this little greasy wire was a kidney, and this little squiggly wire was a pulmonary artery. Open prison heart. Damn, this man be dead. Let's see if this damn thing works. Hey buddy. Anybody gonna say hi? Hi. Hi. Amy! You're not dead. Not quite. But how... Later, later. Where's Monique? They threw her in the rat hole. Okay, we'll just wait for Larry's diversion and then we'll get her out, no sweat. All set here. Say what? That was just a test run. We're very close now. I can feel it in my bones. Damned if I know how you white boys ever took America from the Indians. Come on. We're missing one of the parts. Guards come back any second. Where the hell's that diversion? Hey, I think I found it. Look, I'm telling you, you're doing it wrong, it goes like that, but no, backwards. It says right here, "put gas to reverse to fire on side." That's what I said, look, these are Japanese instructions, they talk backwards. Don't means do, it means you're doing it wrong. We can't wait for that diversion any more. Boe, you take Buffy to the garage. Jeff and I will go get Monique. Crazy. You'll be right by the barracks, they'll spot ya. Just do it, boe. It's our only chance. All right. Good luck. Nice of them to provide limousine service, huh? Yeah, it sure is. You in there? Jeff, is that you? Yeah. Me and the whole damn cavalry. Hi Monique. Amy, you're alive. Alive and kicking. God, I can hug you. Get me the hell outta here, Jeff. Hurry up. Can't get this damn thing open. Duck. Diversion! Japanese shit. Show time. You can't find real ammo, you improvise. Holy hell, you got enough shit in there to blow up the whole place and start world war ill. Son of a bitch! This one's for Tom! Put your hands in the air. Move slowly. Watch 'em! Hands up. Watch that. Put your guns down! Now! Now! What's the car doing here? Whoa, we're friends. Please, allow me to introduce myself. My name is colonel Carlos Perez. I'm secretary of internal security of this country. We're only here to free you. We came with the ransom. There's even a marine from the United States here with me. Sage? Buffy! No, lieutenant Caden. Oh. You the real thing? You bet I am. Lieutenant, will you... That's him! That's the leader! Drop it. I said drop it or I'll kill her. You take the wire. Hurry up. So you have returned. Then we shall try to keep you properly entertained. Keep on talkin', assholes. Ready, you scumbag! Head to the plane! Come on, sarge. He ain't comin'. He's coming. Come on! We gotta get the hell outta here. We stay on the ground, we sittin' ducks. No, just two more minutes. No, no, we gotta go. - We gotta go. - We gotta go! Sarge said so himself. Come on, sarge! Come on, come on! Hey, just like the bad old days, hey buddy? Yeah. You would've thought we learned our lesson. Sarge, did anyone ever tell you that you're wonderful? All the time, Princess.
