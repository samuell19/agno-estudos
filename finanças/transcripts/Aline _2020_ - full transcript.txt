I'm a pretty ordinary guy Sometimes I feel like doing nothing at all I'd smoke weed, I'd drink beer I'd play music With Big Pierre But I need to think about my career I'm a popular singer You want me to be a God If only you knew how old I feel I can't sleep anymore, I'm too nervous When I'm singing is when I feel best But this job is perilous The more you give The more they want... I won't lie to you, Sylvette. I want us to do lots of things, but just for ourselves. What does that mean? It means I don't want children. Antoinette. Jean-Damien. Lucette. Jean-Sylvain. Jean-Bobin. Jean-Colin. Jeannette. Pierrette. Claudette... and Jean-Claudin! You didn't want kids at first, Anglomard. Our eldest is pregnant. You're going to be a grandfather! They're all taken care of. I put the twins in school this very morning. I want to take everything the Lord gives us. God knows I love all 13 with all my heart, Father. I know. But now, I'm just too old. What if this one comes out abnormal? Or if there's no mother for the others? What did he say? "That's utter nonsense, Mrs. Dieu." Better not to ask. I found it. What? We'll name her "Aline". Didn't we say "Poupette"? Nope... Aline! Aline Dieu. It's better. Yes... Are you Mommy's little baby? Are you her last little one? Yes! The Dieu Family Band! Have you seen Aline? Seen Aline? Go on! Your turn, baby. Come. - You okay? - Yes. I left one summer night (Oh Mamy) Without a word, without a kiss goodbye Without looking back at the past Oh, the past Once I crossed the border Wind blowing stronger than yesterday When I was near you, my mother Oh, my mother Oh Mamy Oh Mamy, Mamy blue, Oh Mamy blue Not tonight, unfortunately. She has school tomorrow! I understand, but she's up to 3 a.m. every weekend. That's right. See you Saturday. Did you hear that? "If the kid's not singing, we're not coming." Here are the results of Tuesday's dictation. Josephine, A+. Miss Dieu. Miss Dieu! A nice F, like last week. Goodnight, honey. - Mom? - Yes, lovie? You know what I want most? No. To become a great singer. I know, sweetie. Mommy has something big in mind. What is it? It's you. Listen to me, Jean-Bobin. She can't become a circus freak singing hits like a chimp. She needs a song of her own. For her! We're no dumber than the others. We'll write it. I will! And you'll write the music. You can get help from Jean-Colin, Jean-Claudin or Jean-Sylvain. We can do it! And then, and only then, you'll send it to the guy you mentioned. But not before. 12 years old. The box. The box... Wait. Red... brings good luck. Good. In 2 hours it'll be on his desk. Tonight, I bet we'll get the call. Because this here is good. Very good! Very, very good! Jeez, it's chilly! Who does this manager think he is? He could call! He's not on tour with a singer? He has no more singers. His biggest star dumped him! How do you know? Word gets round in the biz. Excuse me, Mr. Pro! Maybe he's starting over in the States? He was seen at a restaurant with his wife last night. He's not bankrupt. You can be bankrupt and eat out. I'll call him. Wait, Jean-Bobin. Tomorrow. Tomorrow's better. Yes? Thank you. Yes, hello. I called you twice. Not necessary. We left a cassette at your office. Two weeks ago. I just have one thing to tell you. Had you listened to it, you'd have called back already. Thank you. What did he say? He'll listen and call back. In 10 minutes. Answer for God's sake! Wait! Yes, hello? No, I'm not her father. I'm her brother. Yes... 12 years old, I swear. We didn't doctor it. We're not equipped to. Yes, when? I'll check her agenda. Hold on. You're lucky. It's possible. No, thank you! And? We have a meeting. With Mr. Guy-Claude Kamar. When? We better leave now. Mom! Come on! No need to smile so much, honey. My beautiful girl. Dad left this for you. What is it? Dunno. Said it brings good luck. Your shoes! Welcome, have a seat. Mr. Kamar, we spoke on the phone. It's really you singing on this? Yes. I'm talking to you, Céline. Aline. It's you who recorded this, Aline? Of course it's me. You know, the voice I heard on it, it's hard to believe it's yours. That it comes from you. Can you sing for me? I'm used to a mike and people around. Close your eyes. Imagine a big audience in front of you. Filled to the rafters with people listening. I'll be listening too. 1,000%. You've never heard this before in your life. I almost cried. The wheel of fortune turns. The wheel of fortune turns! Our big star may have left... "Big" in every sense! But this one... a diamond in the rough. If we find the right songs, and we will, we'll blow them away. And that's just for the European market. I'll get him. Know-it-all. How many singles did Barbara Streisand sell of Woman in Love in Canada? 71,200. And in the U.S.? 630,000. 1978 Ice Hockey Playoffs. What place did we come in? Canada won the Stanley Cup against Boston in six. Excellent! My name? Josette. You lose. I'm Josette. I'm Jeannette. How about me? Jean... Not taking any risks. Jean-Claudin. How about me? Jean... I'm not a Jean. I'm Mr. Jeannette. Since we don't have kids yet, he was allowed to come. We couldn't show you all 57 at once. With the grand-kids. They come every Sunday and we all fit in here. - I have 3... - Keep it up! You opened my eyes You led every game Tell me anything, I'll love you forever So much love I have For you You, my first smile My first memory You saw me grow up My arms are too small So much love I have For you Mama! I need your eyes on me You're what I believe in You're the best thing I have and accompany me Time makes its way As your hair turns gray I'll be a child till the day I die So much love I have For you I have so much love For You And remember, this is her very first TV performance! Before you go back to your mom, I have one last little question. I think many people want to ask it. Did you study singing? No, I don't need to. Gee whiz, I see we have here a young woman, very self-assured, to whom we wish a beautiful and long career. That was really perfect, Aline. But listen good. What you have, your talent, is not something usual. It's not normal. You and I are the same. At your age, I could count so fast, if someone asked me, let's say, 34 x 61 + 17, I had the answer in a sec. But I kept it to myself. I pretended to calculate. Know why? Not to seem pretentious. People don't like that. She'll hit double gold if this continues. She hit it last Tuesday. I asked your siblings. They all said you have a heavenly gift. No, it's also a lot of work. I rehearse, I practice a lot. Thank you... Martine Lévéque, TV7 Montreal. For you, Michel, I'll give you worldwide exclusivity. I'm gonna sing in Paris! I'm gonna sing in Paris! Mom? Did you hear? Is all well? You're not ill? Everything's fine, thanks. When do we land? In 3 hours, 20 minutes, sir. Can I have sugar instead? Of course. Look. Another plane. - She's a pretty one! - Yeah. We're off! For a Man What's best in the light? Blue, pink? Blue's nice. Aline, we're on. Michel Caron, Danielle Chlostawa at Châtelet until February. Now the moment we're all waiting for. This is her first time on a major TV show. I'll tell you her age later. She has a big career ahead. This year's revelation in Quebec. You don't know her face... They won't be disappointed! Weird face, no grace... You won't forget her voice. You'll blow them away. You're the best... and the most beautiful. The song is Love and Friendship. Remember the name of this girl. Here is Aline Dieu. He thinks of me, I see it feel it know it His smile doesn't lie when he comes for me He likes to talk to me About what he's seen, about the path he took About all of his plans... He is so close to me And yet I don't know How to love him Only he can decide If we're talking about love Or about friendship ! love him and I can Offer him my life Even if he doesn't want my life I dream of being in his arms And... best of all, I hear they listen to the album nonstop at the Vatican. - The Vatican? - Yes, Sylvette. At the Vatican. - Not the Vatican! - You hear me. The Vatican. Jean-Bobin... Aline's album is selling like hotcakes in the Vatican. At the Vatican? At the Vatican! You'll never guess where you're breaking all records. At the Vatican! At the Vatican... At the Vatican! Where's that? I'll tell you something. Songs are 45% show. -45%? - What matters, what makes all the difference is what you give of yourself. The stuff of dreams. I know you understand. I want them to go home starry-eyed. Thank you, thank you very much. Tonight, to end the night in the stars, I want to tell you something important, something I care about. Don't drive too fast. Watch the road on your way home. Thank you very much. Maybe do the Denise Pellerin Variety Show next month. We've dreamt about it for ages. You may think I'm crazy but I know she needs to take a break. A very long break. She doesn't want to. It's necessary, Sylvette. She must take a break, see things and get out of your apron strings. Meet people, go dancing with friends. She has none, Guy-Claude. - Her only friends are her siblings. - Listen. I have big dreams for her. I know she'll realize them. For that, her English must be perfect. And no more little-girl songs. They're not really little-girl songs. And let's face the facts. Teeth-wise... a little work needs to be done. Quite a bit of work. Come and see, Genevieve. - Is the whole family like this? - No. Just me. - Look at this. - Hello. Let's get to it. She has no voice. Open. Uncross your legs. Watch out for my baby's hair with your big fat scissors. Mom, it's my job. I do this all day long! Ready? Shall we go? You sang great, no question. The audience was thrilled. Two fans next to me... Yes, yes, but... during your fifth song, what happened? Your eyes kept wandering. I couldn't see you out there. I moved around. I never budge during the show. I was in the balcony to see if I heard well. Never abandon them. Never. They feel everything. He's right. And that's my only little drawback. Tomorrow in Toronto, you'll blow them away. I know it. Night, champ. Goodnight. Sleep well. Oh no. I won't go to bed yet. Goodnight. This is utter nonsense, Aline. We can find much better than that. You must get better. I'm not sick, Mom. I fell in love. I love him. I'm sure he feels the same. If you pass By this country At night You'll see a lantern That points you to a ball Sing, dance, arms intertwined In order to console poor Bozo Crying on his raft Final bets. No more bets. - She's not asleep? - She is. It's me who can't sleep. I'm sorry but that's not done, Sylvette. No, not "Sylvette". "Mrs. Dieu". Mrs. Dieu mother, even. Things far worse are not done. We need to talk, Mr. Kamar. You betrayed me, Guy-Claude. You betrayed my trust. I confided you with my daughter's talent, not her heart. Her body even less. Don't you understand that my little princess deserves a prince? Not an old prune twice her age and twice divorced. Once. Soon twice. I have my spies and my intel. Like me, you know that her fans, the press, her public won't appreciate your little duo. The old man and the little girl. With my little girl. If you want to stay her manager, and only her manager, you heard me, do what it takes, and on the double. If ever you put your fat paws on her, trust me, I'll strangle you with my own hands. I'm not scared. I've killed chickens, rabbits and even fat pigs. The problem, Mrs. Dieu... sorry, Mrs. Dieu mother, is that absolutely nothing ever happened. That's even worse. I wish you already pounced on her with your blubber and that she disliked it. For 5 years you've climbed each step, one by one. Now you want to knock everything down? Is that it? If it's to be alone on top... I'm here. I'll always be here for you. 2,000%. And you know it. But you know what? We won't be acting out that madness. - You need someone your age. - Why? Because an old prune with a princess makes no sense. Now tell me Mom didn't talk to you. No, no. No, it's not that at all. I reached that conclusion on my own. Guy-Claude Kamar, look at me eye to eye and say you don't love me. And I'll believe you. Not in English, Aline. I'm your mother. I can't stand it anymore! I've had enough. One wants English, the other wants me to stay her baby with vampire fangs. Wonder why only I have them! I can't... I can't let you say that. I had one man in my life: your father. He's all alone at home, while I trek across Alabama, Nebraska, Nevada, to help my baby daughter. But I also want one for my whole life! I'm not allowed. Just one. Who's in the plane on his way God-knows-where, maybe to work things out with his wife. How do I sing tomorrow and the day after if he's gone? The venues may be full but I sing for him, Mom. Since I'm 12. I don't get how you don't get it. I'm too weary to sing or have fun if the two people I love the most are at war all day long. Same pulse as Muhammad Ali's. You're an athlete. You'll bury us all. Don't say that. I'll be on my feet for your competition in Dublin. I must put my foot down! You have to be healthy again, Mom. Guy-Claude hasn't reappeared? No one knows where he is. - He won't come to the competition. - How so? The record company said so. They'll be coming instead. Will young Vincent be there? I don't know. He's nice. His mother opened a chain of chicken restaurants. Mother... At least they gave her dancers. Ours doesn't need any. That Danish girl is good. The Danish girl is good. Don't you think? You'll be fine. There's no reason not to be. Breathe... you have to breathe. Don't stress out. - Guy-Claude! - Thanks, Vincent. She's on now. Give Dad a kiss. I miss you. Hello. By one point! One point, Mr. Prime Minister. "Pretty damn hairy", as we say. She's a champion. I've said so for eight years. She'll be the greatest in the world, you'll see. Yes, we'll celebrate it. Good day, Robert. Your country is blown away. As am I. No drawbacks tonight? No, no drawbacks. You were... I'm speechless. I'll let you rest. If it's what you want, I'll be the first. The first and only. Cuvée Amour de Deutz. Even your dad saw it. He saw it on your face on the news, with your cart at the airport, and said: "We've lost her." Sylvette, don't put words in my mouth! You didn't lose me. Love won, that's all. What hurts me the most is that you lied to me for the first time in your life. I didn't lie. I didn't know he was coming. And because he came, I won. My baby. Naked with that hairy fatso! Mom... Mom, I'm 20! At my age you had Antoinette. But your father wasn't much older than me. He didn't have 3 lives under his belt! He divorced. Fine. I'll shut up. I'll shut up. I'll lie to everyone. Even if I'm the opposite of that. But all I want is shout our love from the rooftops. I can do that too. I'll make myself queen So you won't let me go I'll make myself new To rekindle the flame I'll become the others Who give you pleasure I'll play your games If that's what you desire More gleaming, more beautiful For another spark I'll turn myself into gold So you'll keep on loving me "You shouldn't have started “attracting me, “touching me, "giving so much "And I don't know how to pretend”. I don't know how to pretend. This song, Aline, is about a woman in love. Very much in love. Really? Really. Can we know to whom it's intended? I can't say. I can't say who it is. No way, I'm always crying... Show business is tough. - Excuse me. - Okay, Laurent. Let's take a break. I can start over. - Let's break. - Look. Like nothing ever happened. Let's start over. It's fine, Aline. End of sound check. Thank you all. Hello? 1, 2, 1, 2. Before the break, this just came in. Thanks to you all, all our dates for the European tour are sold out. Thank you, everyone. I have an announcement to make. Something important. Very important. For me and... another person who'll go unnamed, in her black boots. Best ice cream in the world is two and a half hours from here. In Naples. So, for our day off tomorrow, a bus will leave the hotel at noon so we can check it out ourselves. For myself, I know. It's going to be pistachio. In the meantime, have a great show. I thought we were staying in Rome just the two of us. Nope. This one isn't for you. Océane. I'm getting married! I'm getting married! I'm going to be married! Gorgeous! Come here. You're beautiful, my baby! Step back. Okay, gang, get ready. My life is a long endless road And I don't know where it leads I search through cities and towns Hoping to accomplish my destiny Mile after mile I'm sad Mile after mile I grow bored Day after day on the road You can't know how much I love you My darling. What's your name? OUR MARIE-ANTOINETTE!! MILLION-DOLLAR CAKE Shoes too small. Not one pair your size in the whole world? I wanted these for the best day of my life. Tomorrow at the beach you won't need shoes. We'll have three days, just me and you, and we'll make our baby. We're allowed to now. Mosquito got me good. You're full of sugar, honey. What did you eat? Tell Mommy. Are you serious? Aren't you on a diet? You've already had four. Yes, I'm serious. Do I look like I'm joking? They're tiny. Yes, my love. No, I haven't eaten yet. At the pool in 30 minutes. Let's say 45. I'm in a meeting. Are you sure? Just a little salad? Not even some grilled fish? He'd eaten enough meat for 2 years. While supposedly on a diet. I said: "Are you sure? Just a little salad?" He said: "No, no." I thought he's really serious. I admire my husband's discipline. I give him a taste of my chocolate ice cream, which he can barely get down. Then he says: "I'll nap for 5 minutes." 30 minutes later, no Guy-Claude. He's not there. I call the room... No one answers. So I go upstairs... and then I see him there... lying on the floor, all glassy-eyed... - It's not funny! - Not at all. I call the front desk. 5 minutes later: no one. I go into the corridor and I see a huge baggage cart. Full of millionaire luggage. I throw it all off. I say: "Guy-Claude, look at me. Look in my eyes. I love you. It'll be fine." I put him on the cart as best I could. The hospital was two blocks away. I push fast as hell. Speedy Gonzales. We get there. They take my cart and my husband of course. They say: "We'll tend to him". And then, Karine... I realize I'm there in the hospital in front of everyone, barefoot, one boob covered, the other not. You hadn't even noticed? Focused on my husband. My sarong did a 360 along the way. All that matters is that Guy-Claude is fine now. He seems in good health. He is. He's pink, handsome, brand new. You made everyone laugh. - Thanks. - Including me. Really? But... if ever your old billy goat jumps over the Great Fence, his nanny goat must keep making people happy. She must keep building what we both started. Know what would happen otherwise? He'd die a second death. I promise. But don't mention this ever again. You're in good health. Everything's great. Look at this baby in an egg! - Little cutie-pie. - So sweet! Little baby... Little cuties in the cabbage. They made them a hat! - I screwed up yesterday. - You were extraordinary. Look at me. You were extraordinary. I know it. I know you. Listen to me. You sing two nights. Tonight and tomorrow. Thursday is just a one-hour show. Friday, after the Martine Lévéque interview, to help sell out February, we travel. You have 5 hours to relax. Okay, Saturday and Sunday, you do 3 concerts. Not 27 No, 3. But Monday... listen to me. After you sign albums in Ottawa, we'll both go home. You'll have a nice day off for you alone. Something's wrong. - It'll be fine. - Something's off. I'll make an announcement. Good evening. For a few days, Aline has had problems with her vocal cords. We thought she'd be able to finish tonight's show. She wanted to do 2 more songs, 2 and a half. But now, she can't anymore. She can't tell you herself. Thanks for your comprehension, your kindness. Thanks from her. She says she loves you and that she'll come back. Thank you. I'll go find your heart If you take it elsewhere Even if you spend hours Dancing with others girls I'll go look for your soul In the cold and the flames I'll cast spells on you So you'll keep on loving me So you'll keep on loving me Do you like coffee? Yes. Time to give it up. Ice cream? Chocolate. That's over. Nothing cold ever again on the vocal cords. Speak on the phone? For hours. With my mother, when I travel. Meaning? Every day of my life. So stop that too. Screaming your lungs out on stage is better than 2 minutes on the phone. If you do all this, I'm sure to cure you. Our national treasure! 7 million Québécois would tear out my two eyes. She doesn't understand why it doesn't work. I'm not at all saying it comes from you, Guy-Claude. I hope not, Sylvette. Especially since I had 3 before I met her. Yes, that's true. But it's been a while. No! Today's the left one. It's not getting better. Not at all. Is all well at home? No problems? Family, husband... No. I don't want to operate. Too risky. You could lose your voice. Or... totally change your tessitura. That would be terrible. We'll be more radical. You'll have to stop speaking. Completely. Not one more word. Not even like this? For how long? Should I make you cutlets again? Guy-Claude loved them on Tuesday. He ate 7. Is that okay? Don't worry. How about chicken? Veal meatballs? I can't speak Three days? Three years? Three months. Oh fuck. Chicken OK! I'll tell him. Say that again? Will she ever sing again? What's going on, Aline? It's three months exactly. Today I'm allowed to start speaking. I don't like it You know you're allowed to speak. I don't like it. We can maybe do a demo? I'm Fred. I'm doing your make-up. Let's get started. We'll take five. - I'm really sorry. - Don't be. - We're allowed to be sad. - I'm ashamed. Don't be. If only you knew. I cried all night in the plane. For real? Dumped by text on the way to the airport. After 15 years. Dumped like garbage. Just bye-bye? Just "bye-bye". You have no one in Paris? No... Yes, my brother who hates fags. Okay. How can I help you, Aline? Not much. Yes, make me as pretty as possible. It won't be easy. My husband must be proud of me, nevertheless. Why "nevertheless"? More sensual, Aline. No tongue. Stand in profile. Hand on hip. Are you free on the 23rd? Let's make some room so we can breathe. Wait! Aline, what the... My mom gave them to her mom. I do the same. This is the one. I'm sure. Up there! Listen... You were... magnificent. You were right to change dresses. Two fans want to see you. I'm not ready... Two minutes. I just need two minutes. Mom! No way! You were in the audience? Mom, I'm thrilled! I can't believe it. Your Guy-Claude kept us hidden in a room all day. Dad, you were here too. I can't believe it. My little Poupette. - You're beautiful, Mom. - See how I'm made up? You were in on it? I'm kept in the dark. Dad, I don't believe it. How did you travel? By plane. Too long to drive. Yes, I figured. You were so good. So beautiful! I have something of yours. Look. What's inside? My gold coin. That's right. Still have it? I have it on me all the time. Gotcha! I'm sick of carrot puree. I know. But it's for your heart, sweetheart. - You don't like this. - Better than nothing. Since when? Three days? Three months. It seems to be the only news. Aline and Guy-Claude are having a baby. Major scoop! You bet. Even with a war, this would be the top story. And his first burp, his first step, his first tooth. Anyway, if he's bald with bad teeth, we'll have no doubt who the parents are. No, this makes me uneasy. I'm friends with Mama Dieu. I never saw her before. - Mama Dieu! - Our national Sylvette. She's always around. The child will have his own room. The couple just bought a villa with 40 rooms! One of the priciest around. Why, did you see it? Not me, personally. But look. I have my spies in Vegas. There we go! I'd hate to do the house-cleaning! Jeez, it's humongous! Enormous. I also know her parents and siblings each have one. Not as impressive as theirs. So what? - That still makes 14 houses. - It's a lot! An entire village. I won't reveal my sources, and I'm not the type to judge, but I heard that they're buying the baby. - No! -I heard... the figure of 50,000 dollars. Martine, did you check... Let them blab, Mom. The English tabloids would kill you. Guy-Claude's treatment is working. Our baby's is securely attached. All is well. Right now, my problem is I'm lost. Here, at home. I went into the pool house and took different stairs. Oh great, I recognize the door. Nope. I just saw a wine cave. And I don't know where I am. I'll call you back in 10 minutes, honey. Mama... I can't find my fishing rods. They're in their spot. In the garage. Which one? Jeannette? I can't find Mommy. Mommy's right there. The world is full of singers. My son has only one mother. We organized everything so that you can do both. 50-50. Listen to me. 7 p.m., you see your guests before the show. To discuss a show they haven't seen? You'll find something. I know you. 8:15, you go on stage. 10:20, show over, leave stage. 10:23, lounging in the limo. 10:55, home at last with Junior. 5 years like that, nice and easy. - 5 years nice and easy? - That's right. Isn't that great? - Happy New Year, Mommy! - Happy New Year, lovie. You're not asleep? You waited up? He kept looking for your car from the bathroom window. I don't love you, I adore you! I adore you, you know? Last show of the week. - Holding up? - I've known worse. Good. This isn't good. Quebec style. Obviously. You bet. We can't tell her now. No, we can't. It's too late. After the show. Come on, it's time. I'm very sorry, Aline. What for? Your father. We could have canceled. He wouldn't have liked that. Nice and hot. French style. Goodnight, honey! Mommy will wake you up when she finishes her Vegas shows. All right? My little baby. Hello, honey. It's over! Mommy's done working. - For real? - Yes, honey! We're leaving. We'll visit the world, all three of us. On vacation? In a way. What's Junior doing tonight for the first time? Seeing Mom at work! You're a big boy now. It may be time to cut this long hair. No, I don't want anyone seeing me. Hello, Paris! Why doesn't she say hello to us? Hello, Junior! See? She heard you! - Hear that? - That's not such good news. Mommy's little babies. Who's smiling at Mommy like that? They smell so good! Not so good. One did a number 1. The other did his number 2. Mommy will eat it all up! Vanilla pudding for Mommy! She's not getting better. I heard that! So long, honey. Have a good match! Yes, honey. Off to work! Your humidifier. Cotton, breast pump. Two ice packs for the milk. Jean-Bobin has two more for the ride back. - Thanks. Love you. - Me too. Rehearse well and don't worry. They both had their milk. We're at 76% seating capacity. It's fine. We still have 6 weeks. But you'll have to do some press. I don't want you singing to one empty seat. It's never happened before. Exactly. I don't want it ever to happen. Not now, not after. Wait, I'll put her on. I'm putting her on. Hold on. It's Junior. Two L's. No, one V. Or else one I and one V. I don't know how to spell "elevator". Mom didn't go to school much. Listen to me... write "stairs". If they ask, say it goes to the same place. Yeah, I love you too, champ. That's right. You chose the date, Aline! I know, but it's too soon. I get no sleep! One wakes up, then the other! Jealous Junior wakes up and whacks my shins with golf clubs. I have to pump milk every 3 hours. Know how many interviews I did between fittings today? 29. Bla-bla-bla, I gain weight, you lose. And Martine Lévéque, all kiss-assy! I told you to stop inviting her! I go back on stage in 5 days 3 hours at the mirror. The curling iron burns my scalp. And the girdle... I have blubber all over the place. My milk drips down the sequins and scratches my skin. I can't go on. I need peace and quiet! I miss my cotton-lined drawer at my mom's house. Mommy! My big Mama. Yes, baby. I'm here. 3 years will go by fast. Sorry. I bother you and you're the one not well. It's all fine. Your stage monitor. And this is Guy-Claude. You hear me, my love? Me too. You're beautiful, my love. After the chorus, do Bugs Bunny for me. I'll never make it. I wanted this just for family. Something gentle, peaceful. Too many people here. Breathe. Breathe deeply. Honor him. He's watching. You're right. Be pretty for him. For us. For me a little. Can I ask you something? Whatever you want. The twins left with Jeannette. Junior is in hockey camp. I won't be able to sleep home alone. I'll lose it. Can I sleep at your place after the show? Of course! Thanks, Fred. - Now I'm ashamed. - Why? My tiny two-room apartment. You have no idea where I live. You have no idea where I come from. 8 girls in one room. One bathroom for 16. Ask Jean-Bobin. At the end of the month, we used ketchup on ketchup. I mean it! I'm 15 minutes away. Behind the Cromwell. You know, down by Washington Avenue. No idea where that is. I've never set foot outside. - In 14 years? - Not once. My love. Don't be upset. I have no strength left. Do as you wish, my love. Do as you can, especially. It'll all be fine. I didn't dare open. Know what my kid sister has in her bags? Nothing. Or almost. So? Still nothing. - I'll look again. - Shall I come? If she comes back, I want someone here. We have no choice. So? I'll make an announcement. we'll cancel. We cancel and call the cops. I'm a girl An ordinary girl Sometimes I feel like doing nothing at all I'd play music With a drink With my mother My sisters, my brothers But I need to think About my career I'm a popular singer You see me Like a goddess I'm a woman Not a princess I feel it's time That I confessed When I'm singing Is when I feel best But this job Is perilous The more you give The more they want One day When I'm too weary I'll consider Giving up my spot I'll make my farewells With class I hope to leave you A trace And etch forever In your hearts Only love, only happiness I love my neighbors I love my public All I want Is for things to click I don't give a damn About critics When I sing It's for the public ! am not A circus freak My life is my music If I sing It's to be heard When I shout It's to defend myself I'd like To be understood I'd like to travel Around the world Before I'm dead Before I'm buried And see the world from above All around me There is war Fear and hunger And misery I'd like For us to be brothers That's why We're here on earth ! am not A popular singer Just an ordinary woman Subtitles: Andrew Litvack
