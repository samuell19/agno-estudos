How has India developed during fifty years of independence? - Yes. Independence? - Yes. - What independence are you talking about? We don't have any independence. What is he saying? - He said that there is no freedom for him. Is it getting recorded? There has been so much development. Petty leaders became rich and started looting us.

How could it not progress? What do you think? Has India progressed or not? Yes! It has progressed! India is the best! Our beloved India is the best in the world!

We work for the radio, not for a newspaper! There is no need to sensationalize this. They are dangerous people. Mrs. Burman, my job is to find out what an Indian thinks and feels... ...after fifty years of independence. Do you have to go into forests to ask them this question? It is necessary, Mrs. Burman. They belong to this country and are angry with us. Don't you want to know what they think and why this is so? It's impossible! They will refuse to meet you! Everything is arranged! A jeep will pick us up! Didn't Shukla tell you? - Yes, indeed. You made these arrangements? Why would I, but... He wanted to see a tree... - Mrs. Burman just a minute - Hold this. But asked for a forest... In Delhi he meets people but there are no trees... He said that he wanted to go to a forest. - Just listen. - Hey! "Let's dance under the shadow of love."

This is for the radio, so please speak in Hindi. You won't speak my language but I must speak in yours? It's not that! I've prepared the questions in English! - Ok. Thank you. First of all, I wanted to ask you that you look exactly like we do! Absolutely normal! What else did you expect? What is your aim? Your aim. - Independence! Independence! From whom? - From your government. The Indian Government! Why? - Why? Yes, why? So many promises were made to us 50 years ago... ...when India became independent but... ...none of the promises were kept and... ...we were exploited and oppressed by your army. Yet, this is your country! - No! That's what you think but Delhi is India. States like ours which lie in one corner... ...do not mean a thing to you! Ask me why! Why? Because we are small states! It is not big state. Delhi is only interested in the bigger states. We've been left to die here. Terrorist... - We are not terrorists! We're revolutionaries! From where do you get your weapons? From where do you get your guts? Where do you get the weapons from? From anywhere. I've heard that Pakistan and China help you. That you get weapons from across the border, and you... I cannot say anything. You hand over weapons to young children and... ...turn them into terrorists for your selfish reasons. That's enough! Let's go! He is worthy of our cause! He has courage and daring! If you ever leave the Radio, come and join us. Now go. Take him. It was night. Half loung station. He was waiting. The train was to come but the rain came instead. The rain droplets were playing like the kids tearing the sky. The trees were swinging as if they had lost their senses. The branches of the trees dashed against one another. It was raining so heavily as if to sink the world. In all this, I saw somebody on the other platform. Brother! Do you have a matchbox? The wind blew the cloth from her head on to her shoulders. Girl. - "Hey stranger... ...please call out from somewhere..." Dark brooding eyes chubby cheeks... ...flat nose as if stuck in a hurry. "You live a fragmented life, I know not where." - Golden... The moment he saw the girl he decided to... ...save her from the bandits and take her away on a horse. But there were no horses or bandits. I thought you were a man and asked for a matchbox! Sorry! She made no reply... just a quick magical look. "Hey stranger..." Why doesn't she smile? Or ask anything? Cigarette... sorry! Just then suddenly like scattered pearls. She said. - Tea! Yes! - Madam, a change is in the offing! A change? - Yes! - Like. Amar is looking after everything! "The wind blew like the velvet." A glass with printed flowers! I ran with the hot tea! I ran careful not to spill the tea... "It says..." "The one who was fair like the cream." But the train started... ...as if it was an insult to stop at a small station. The whistle went off. I saw the train. I did not know if it was her train or mine. The guard showed the red and then the green flag. I ran after the train... "Hey stranger..." The train left the station and so did the girl. Hey! Here! - Here! - Thank you. Will a one-rupee stamp be enough for this? Weigh it. What are you doing? I was here first! Listen to me, brother. - Greetings. - One minute. - Hello! "You are not present, but your smile is all around..." "I am unable to see your face, but can hear your footstep..." "Where are you..." "Where is your symbol..." - Hello! - Hello! In the line. There is no local. I know. - "I was living incomplete..." The meter is out of order! Will this do? Only STD. Do you have change? Talk if you've change! Ok. Twenty rupees! Full rate! No half! No quarter! Thank you. Join the politics! Hey you! My cycle. - Sorry sir! Sorry! This is not right! We've met twice but you refuse to recognize me. Stop following me! No. - You'll have to stop this! Why? - I don't like it! I won't accept that! - I... - Look! What is the problem? Your parents? Relatives? Community? Religion? Or those Two men in the train? I don't know who they are But I could talk to them. Actually, the thing is... If need be I can also fight with them. - It's not that!

That you cannot live without me. Yes! That is true! I will die. - Is it? Without me? Like this! Why talk of Death? Just tell me that you love me! Oh, you have no time. Right? Hey, if you want to leave the old man, I am here Bye... bye. Why didn't they take him to their village? Why leave him with us? He understands your language.

First I'll tell you what I dislike the most. I dislike this distance between us. There is a lot hidden within you. What I hate the most are your eyes because... ...when I look into them I cannot see anything. Now I'll tell you what I like the most. What I like the most are your eyes because... ...when I look into them I cannot see anything. There's a lot hidden within you and I like that.

Hello sir! - Be happy! What is it, dear? - What have you decided? Mother... We went for lunch! While we were returning... We saw a boy running. Amar ran after the boy and I ran after him. In this running around, we had no time to think. Yes or no! That's all we want to know! How can we say yes so quickly? We've just met and... And... - It's a yes from my side! What did I tell you?

His stomach will show deposits of potassium cyanide. Could we have saved him? Impossible! He must have died in ten minutes. If amyl nitrate had been given there may have been a 40% chance. Cyanide is dangerous. Have you seen this? This looks like staff notations, sir! Right. - Find it out. Check out the Yellow Pages. Find out all shops dealing in musical instruments in Delhi. Check every shop. Ok! - Right sir. Thank you very much, doctor. God knows what the police must have got out of him. I am sure he has not told them anything. I am sure he told them nothing. He wouldn't have told anything to them. Stop crying! He was a brother to Meghna! There are no brothers or sisters here. We have not come here to cry. Ken wouldn't have liked these tears He was a soldier who died a martyr. He didn't die as anyone's brother. What will we do here? We have to do something. You tell me. - Yes! It is decided! You're about to get engaged! Then you'll get married and have kids. Then they will get married and have kids. Then one day you will become a grandma. You'll have to see that man's face all your life.

What wrong have they done? Everything will be finished for them. They trusted us! Gave us a place to stay! Are we doing the right thing? Innocent people will be killed, isn't it? Don't you ever have doubts about yourself? The aim of our revolution is... The aim of our revolution is... Independence for our own land. Towards that cause we surrender ourselves.

How many people in your group? I don't belong to any group, sir! Look! I am also a Government servant and I work... ...at All India Radio as a Program Executive. I don't know anything more than that.

Ok. Sorry! Can we go from ahead? Yes, go ahead. - Park it there. We'll have to take a detour! Come on! These terrorists do this and then we are harassed. Then these people harass us. - Take a right from here. Take a right. Keep going. Sir, you are not a terrorist, is it? Let's go! Faster. - Strange. Meghna! I thought something had happened. I thought you... Hey! Where are you going? Come on! - Where? Who are you? Who are you and why have you come here? Don't try to lie! I am tired of your lies! Why did that boy run away from me? Was it a coincidence or was he sent to trap me? He is dead! You came to my house and asked for a job. Not any job but with All India Radio! Why? I followed you like a fool but you used me, Meghna! Why? You used me Why did you do like this? Why are you doing all this? Why this hate! This terror! This devilishness! Don't your parents say anything? Meghna, you spoke of music. You, in that temple... ...you spoke of your mother's hands! Talk! And what do you do? Make bombs! Kill people! You don't know the life I have lived. You haven't seen all that I've seen. You sit in Delhi and play songs on All India Radio. What would you know of the difficulties... ...we have undergone in the last fifty years. We are being betrayed for the last fifty years. When we asked questions we were suppressed. They destroyed my parents. You don't know anything! What do you know? You think if terrorism has increased it is not your fault. We are losing our lives don't you have a hand in it? We do not love the way we live but we have no option. Father! Father! Father! Death in every house. Death at every step. Days nights for years... They went on killing and we went on dying. Blood on all four sides! Corpses on all four sides! Screams still echo in my ears! Enough! Enough! Enough! Enough! Sister! Do you know what fear means?

We take an oath. - We take an oath. Meghna, Meghna... ...l'll give up everything! This job, house... I'll give up everything! Come away with me! Forget all that has happened to you. Let us both run away from here. You and me. Won't you come? Tell me you won't do this. I can't. So terrorist, what do you want to do? How many do you want to kill? Come! I'll come with you! We'll kill people together! Come! You still don't understand! Meghna, I can understand what happened to you. I don't know what's going to happen next. How many will you kill? Ten? Twenty? Thirty? Forty? Fifty? What will be the result? Will that end the problems of your state? Will that bring back your happiness? I know what happened to you was wrong but... ...for the mistake of a few people... ...will you punish the entire nation? The mistake of a few people? What is this mistake? Killing innocent people? Or burning down villages? Raping 12 year old girls? If you cannot reply to our cause... ...you cannot give us justice. Then is it a crime to ask for justice? Small children picked up the gun but... ...their parents did not stop them! Why? Because it made no difference even if they died. Because there was no other alternative to survive... ...from your army from your dictatorship. Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! Shut up! I know what the army is! You would have been dead fighting amongst yourself... Every village is fighting with each other. Had it not been for the army, our country... ...would've been divided into small pieces! Understood? So your army will save us? Who else will save you? Will terrorists or terrorism save this country? Your country! Not mine! What will you do, Meghna? What will you do? Kill people? Or blow up this country with a bomb? What will you do? Go celebrate fifty years of your freedom... ...while the world sees our suppression for fifty years. What fifty years? Fifty years? Fifty years... 26th January parade! What are you going to do? What are you going to do? You... You used me! Yes! Who are you to me? You mean nothing to me! What your heart says? What you think? Your house? Your family? Your marriage, your kids... They don't mean a thing to me. What are you people going to do? Tell me! Tell me what are you people going to do then? Where is everyone? Tell me! - What will you do? What are you wearing? - What's this? - What are you wearing? Don't touch me! - What are you wearing? Leave me! - What are you wearing? Leave me! - What are you wearing? Tell me what it is. Tell me, what is it? You there! Dare tease a girl! - Leave me. I will not let you do anything. You are misbehaving with a girl? Madam, you leave. She is a dangerous girl! Don't let her go! I'll teach you a lesson! Come on, make him sit inside. Hey, you don't know her. They are five persons: two women and three men! And we have reconstructed their faces from the burnt photographs. They seem to be dangerous and equipped... ...with the sophisticated technology. They are here for the last three weeks. They have purchased old military trucks. We have the chassis and engine numbers... ...we have also found out that these people used... ...RDX with a 555 timer to blow up the shop. What does all this mean? Sir, 26th January! Hello! Preeti! This is Amar! Listen! You rang up at the right time. I was bathing! - Listen to me! I am completely wet! - It's important! I am only wearing a bathrobe! Shut up! I want to talk. What do you want to say? - Don't talk rubbish. Shut up! You must help me! Mita and Meghna are staying with us? When they return, engage them to stay there. Hello! This boy is with us! If you could suppress this matter then... He hit a Constable! We know! Help us! It's in your hands! No money! This matter concerns a woman! Yes, I am alright. I'll come home and explain! Both Mita and Meghna are dangerous! - Keep it down! Let me complete. - You are free now. Go. If you ever hit a policeman, I'll set you right. Teach him a few manners. What is happening? - Lay this in the garden. Hurry up! Hurry up! Mrs. Verma, Arun Kashyap from Delhi CBI! We want to question Amar! You've been misinformed! It is impossible! No, Mrs. Verma! We have strong evidence! Whatever proof you have is wrong. My son is the son of an army officer. A few people were staying here! Now they are not here. Where are they? Who were they, Mrs. Verma? Meghna and Mita, Amar's friends! Where are they now? They were here. What about Amar? There's a marriage in this house in four days. Lots of work to do. Clothes, jewellery... ...food is still to be arranged. He must have gone out on some work. Why did Meghna and Mita leave the house? Look Mrs. Verma, if you have any newspaper cutting letter... ...any phones which they made or received anything which you remember. Please give it to me. This will also be a great service to the nation. If I find out that my son is a terrorist... I'll ring you up and have him arrested. Sorry, Mrs. Verma, you will have to come with me. Please. What's going on? - Excuse me. I am an ex-army officer. This is official. What is going on, here? - Take care of everyone. Keep walking quietly! Make a sound and I'll kill you! You cannot save yourselves! The CBI knows everything! Even now they must be after you. Where are you taking me? What's this darkness? My darling, come with me. Come with me, dear. O fool! Is that uniform meant only to keep you warm? Look at this. Trying to impress a girl with the uniform. Look at him. You are enjoying. - You dare not interfere. Don't hit me. - Inspector. - I'll put him behind the bars. I'll put him behind the bars. Move back. Hey, wait! I'll thrash you. You hit me! Hit me now. Hit me now. Hit me now. Hit me now. You hit me. Quiet! Quiet! Hello! Hello! Hello! Hello! Meghna! - Who? Who is speaking? Meghna, don't do this, Meghna. You come to me. Amar, nothing has happened to you? I am not dead! As long as I am not dead, I'll try to stop you. Come to me! Please! Where are you? Where? You can't come here! You are my life my love! Don't you understand that love is greater than terrorism? I am too far it is too late, Amar. No, Meghna! I won't let you go, Meghna! I won't let you go! It is not late. No... Hello. - What is this? What are you doing? Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Listen to me! I want permission, sir. Sir, all the vans have to be checked... ...which are going to be in the parade. What are you saying? I am sorry sir I also want to check the tanks... ...which will salute the President. That is not a just demand. We have been protecting this country. Don't you trust us? Sir, listen to me, sir. Sir, we've lost a Prime Minister because of her bodyguards. Tight security has never hurt anyone, sir. This parade will go on as it has been going on for years. What do you think of yourself? All the security cordons be reconstituted but... ...this matter should be kept a secret. Till the 26th January no one should know... ...who is in charge of which gate And sir, please, please. General! Can this be done? Hazarika? Yes, sir. It will be done! Amar! Amar! Amar! Amar! Amar! What has happened to you, Amar? What has happened to you, Amar? I must find Meghna. I must stop everyone. Don't you understand, Amar? This matter is not within our control! The CBI thinks that you are also a terrorist. They have taken mother away for inquiries. Mother? Please, let go of this, Amar! I have to find Meghna! I have to stop her before dawn! You can't... you can't forget her, isn't it? She'll listen to me! She won't go through with it if she sees me. I must stop her, Preeti! Then why have you come here? You should have gone to Sunder Nagar! Sunder Nagar? What should I do with the wedding cards? Should I write her name with yours? - Where in Sunder Nagar? Why should I tell you? I don't know! Where in Sunder Nagar? I don't know, an old house behind the bus stand! Who told you? I heard it with the kids over the telephone. Are you happy? Now answer my question! What do I do with these cards? Don't move! What are you doing? - Look for cyanide! Look for cyanide! What are you doing? Who are you? Call the ambulance, quick! - He is not a terrorist! Shut up and be quiet for God's sake! And take your seat, please! What's going to happen? Human bomb? I don't know anything. - What will you use? Explosives? - I am not with them! I just discovered that... ...they are at Sundar Nagar. Where are the explosives? You kept her in your house? - I am not with them! Sir... You kept Meghna in your house? - Yes, but... You kept Meghna in your house! Yes or no? She worked at All India Radio and did not have a place. Didn't you give her the place and also the job? Yes, I got her the job! Because I loved her! Why should we accept this? - I am telling you! You went to the North East and met terrorists? Yes! I interviewed them!

Don't sleep! What are you looking at? My last sunrise! Are you afraid? - No! Fear left me last night. You're looking very beautiful! Do you know why?

Take me with you too. Take me with you too. Tell me that you love me. Once tell me, just once, that you love me. Tell me just once that you love me. Tell me that you love me. Tell me just once that you love me. Tell me just once that you love me. "Let me sleep in the laps of death." "Let me sleep in the laps of death." "Let me sleep in the laps of death." "Let my soul be in you." "Let my soul be in you."
