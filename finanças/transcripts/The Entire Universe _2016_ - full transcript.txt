[TRUMPETS PLAYING] [DRUM ROLL] [AUDIENCE CHEERS AND APPLAUDS] Thank you very much. Thank you, thank you. Good evening. Roughly 41 years ago, today-ish, Rutland Weekend Television, the world's smallest TV station, did a special, starring Beatle, George Harrison. And now, tonight, 41 years later, we're back to put on another TV special, with the Beatle of science, professor Brian Cox. [AUDIENCE CHEERS] [AUDIENCE APPLAUDS] And tonight, our subject is the entire universe, which we'll be covering in one hour. As a musical. OK, so, without further ado, please welcome, all the way from Rutland, Muriel Tritt. And the Muriel Tritt School of Music and Dance.

Bit of a snag, he's not here. But he should be on the way from the airport. -This is a live show. -Yeah, he'll be on his way. I hope so. Anyway, that's not the snag. You see, I haven't been able to speak to him for the last few weeks. -What? -Well, I haven't been able to explain to him... This isn't so much a kind of lecture, it's more of a musical. You didn't get a hold of him? Well, it's not my fault, is it? He's been to Patagonia testing magnetism or something. You know, no cell phones. So, he doesn't know it's a musical? -[MAN] He's here. -Oh, jeez. -Harry! -Brian, where've you been? Sorry, I'm late. Can you just pay for the taxi? What? We've already started. I know, it's funny, isn't it? We can to send probes into space at tremendous speeds, but one lane closed on the M25 and you're stuck forever. We've been trying to reach you for weeks. I've been to Patagonia, measuring micro magnetism. It's very interesting, because the Earth's poles are beginning to shift... We phoned. We texted. We tweeted. I can't use cell phones, because we measure in micro-magnetism. Tell me, you did get the script. What? Not unless you sent it by llama. What? -What's this? -It's just a costume. No time to explain. -I haven't got my lecture. -It's all right. It's all on the autocue. And, here we are. Here's the set. Hey, Brian. Robin, what are you doing here? Er... Helping. I'm putting in the correct number of billions and billions in the autocue for you. I have put in loads, you'll love it. Now... Pointer. Clicker. Showtime. Ladies and gentlemen, will you please welcome, Professor Brian Cox. [AUDIENCE CHEERS AND APPLAUDS] [WHOOPING] Thank you. Good evening. This... Is the Hubble deep field image. It's the deepest image of our universe ever taken. [CHOIR SINGING] It's the photograph of a piece of sky, you would cover if you took a five pence piece and held it about 75 feet away. [CHOIR SINGING] It contains over 10,000 galaxies. Each with a 100 billion stars. [CHOIR SINGING] -What the hell is that? -It's the universe music, Brian. -[STAMMERING] It's distracting. -It sounds really good. Yeah, it sounds really, really... Really, kind of, jazzes up the universe. Tell them I don't need any music in the lecture. Well, you know, with the BBC broadcasting it worldwide live... Hang on a minute, I thought it was only broadcasted in Rutland? Well, mainly Rutland, but also, the rest of the world. Look. Just read the autocue, please, because we're running a bit late. OK? Please welcome, Professor Brian Cox. [AUDIENCE CHEERS] This is, the Sloane digital sky survey. This is real data. It's a fly-through of nearby galaxies in the observable universe, which contains around 350 billion large galaxies, each with 200 billion stars, just like our Milky Way. So, if we multiply 350 billion galaxies by 200 billion stars, that means, in the observable universe, there are at least, 70,000 billion billion stars. Seven followed by 22 zeros. Seven billion trillion stars. And that's just the observable universe. We've got good reason to think the universe extends way beyond that little patch we can see. Might even be infinite in extent. Now, today, after expanding for 13.8 billion years, we can see out to the edge of a giant sphere, centred on the Earth, 90 billion light years wide. [TWINKLES] [BRIAN] What's this? What the hell is this? Robin!

[AUDIENCE APPLAUDS] Science isn't a bloody musical. Everyone is very excited. I really look like a prat. You have looked like a prat before. -Science isn't showbiz. -Well, it can be. This is not the Morecambe and Wiseshow, is it? [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] [APPLAUSE] It could be. Hey, you can see the join. -Definitely a wig. -Definitely. Definitely. [AUDIENCE APPLAUDS] -You all right, lad? -Warwick Davis, big fan. Warwick, what are you doing here? I'm playing "The Big Bang". Ba-da-ba-ba! [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] -What? -I know, irony. But he's right tip-top on science, Brian. Per foot, he knows more about science than Tim Peake. Yeah, that's right. Isn't it, Tim? [AUDIENCE CHEERING] [AUDIENCE APPLAUDS] That's right, Brian. Absolutely, that's right. -What? -Really. Warwick is really good on science, Brian. He's absolutely amazing and he could've been on the International Space Station with me. He would've saved a lot of space. Cheers, Tim. You still on for dinner Tuesday? Absolutely, yeah. Your turn to pay. Oh, OK. Tim, I've got a couple of questions. Listen, ask me any question you like. All right, what's a light year? A light-year, is when you don't have very much on, say, a panto in Woking and a possible telly. No, it's a measure of distance. The distance light travels in one year. -Which is... -Six trillion miles. Am I right? -Yeah. -Yeah. Six followed by 12 zeros. Now, let me ask you a question. What's hot, dense and forever expanding? -Well... -The Kardashians. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] -Lovely joke, Warwick. -Thanks, Eric. -It's G-string theory. There's another one. -Ah, I love it. We'll have a shot of Kim's bum, you know. -That could be like Saturn. -What? Like a great gas giant? Oh, boo-boom! You see, material like this, writes itself, Brian. So, moving on now, on the autocue, love, if you think of the universe as... If you think of the universe as a balloon... Oh, great metaphor. With the galaxies represented by dots on the balloon. Then the expansion of our universe is just like the expanding surface of the balloon. All the galaxies appear to be rushing apart from each other. [BLOWING] Carry on. [CONTINUES BLOWING] We used to think the universe was slowing down under the effects of gravity, until we measured the expansion rate very precisely back in the 1990s, and discovered that it is in fact, speeding up, because of the effects of something known as dark energy. Now, we don't know what dark energy is, but it accounts for 70% of the energy density of the universe. [CHUCKLES] Dark matter makes up a further 25%. We don't know what that is either. And the stuff... You all right? Yeah, I'm hyperventilating, quickly. The stuff we can actually see, shining as stars and out of which we are all made, is only five percent of the universe. So, the universe is expanding, but from what? If we're able to reverse time, wind back the clocks until everything rushes back together again. [BALLOON FIZZLES] Sorry. If we wind everything back to the beginning, if we go back in time 13.8 billion years before there were any stars or galaxies, and all the matter of the universe was crammed into a tiny, wrinkly, little pea, unimaginably hot, unimaginably dense, containing all the energy and the ingredients to build the hundreds of billions of galaxies, and billions of trillions of stars in our universe, contained in a single primordial atom, we call that, "The Big Bang". And hold it there, love. For the Big Bang song. -The Big Bang isn't a song. -It is now. [EXPLOSION] [SINGING] -What are they doing? -It's pretty obvious, isn't it? They're elementary particles. Look. They're banging into each other and then disappearing. -Particles? -Yeah, much better than your boring old equations. [SINGING] [EXPLOSION] [EXPLOSION] [EXPLOSION] [EXPLOSION] [EXPLOSION] [EXPLOSION] [EXPLOSION] [EXPLOSION] [EXPLOSION] [EXPLOSION] [AUDIENCE APPLAUDS] [SIGHS] So, what'd you think? I'm a professor, no one will take me seriously if they think I'm in showbiz. Yeah, I think that ship might've sailed some time ago. Erm, and the BBC did say that they were gonna pay you more money. The early cosmos can be thought of as a series of epochs. As in the gradually expanding and cooling universe, the forces of nature separate out, and the particles we see today, the protons, neutrons and electrons, out of which we are all made are formed. Time itself started 13.8 billion years ago. And once time had started... Sorry, Brian. Can we hold time? -What? -Can we just hold time for a minute, please? Well, time isn't here, yet. -What? -Hannah Waddingham is playing time. But, unfortunately, she's late. Er, she's stuck in traffic. So, if you give us just a bit more BS. I'm sorry, a bit more science about the early universe until she gets here. Thanks a lot. You could say that more happened in the first three minutes of the life of the universe than in the next 13.8 billion years. By the time the universe was around three minutes old, it had cooled down to a temperature of only a billion degrees. And it was filled with, what we call, a plasma. A soup of electrically charged particles through which light couldn't pass. Now, light can be thought of as a stream of particles called photons and they have no mass. But other fundamental particles, like electrons, do have mass. And they get it through the interaction with the Higgs field, which permeates the universe, and has a particle associated with it, called the "Higgs boson". Ha-har, Captain Cox. Ha-har. -Who are you? -Got better. Um. [AUDIENCE APPLAUDS AND CHEERS] Who? I'm Higgs boson, me hearties! Ha-har! Noel Fielding, meet Brian. Brian... Brian, huge fan. Love your astrology. Astronomy. Whatever. What's your star sign? -I haven' got a star sign. -Come on, everyone's got a star sign. All right, gin and tonic. [CHUCKLES] That's not a star sign. -He's a Pisces. -I knew it. I'm a Gemini. -We get on instantly. -We don't. All right. Unless, you've got Jupiter rising. I've got anger... Rising. I've got a very finely-tuned drivel detector. And it goes off every time someone mentions "Astrology". It's all true, isn't it? Well, it's not, really. It's kak. What kind of talk is that? Kak? You'll be saying crop circles don't exist, next. Crop circles don't exist. This is ridiculous. Next you'll be saying, global warming is a real thing that we should all be worried about. -Eric, can we just have a word? -Just keep going, keep going. Brian, the thing is, I love science. I love scientology. I love all the sciences. I hope one day, to have a haemorrhoid named after me. -Like you. -Asteroid. Whatever, you get what you want named after you, and I'll get what I want named after me. And I'm getting a haemorrhoid. Like you. [CHUCKLES] Brian, do you know my theory about the universe? You've got a theory about the universe? Yes. You don't know about my theory? I don't know your theory about the universe. I've looked at all the literature. I've seen no record of your theory about the universe. [CHUCKLES] You don't know? This is gonna blow your mind. I've been working on this for over four and a half days. I believe that the universe is entirely made of water. It's just that the molecules are so far apart, you can't tell it's water, unless you're outside, looking in. [IMITATES EXPLOSION] [IMITATES EXPLOSION] It's too much for you, isn't it? I can see. Your knees are trembling. [CHUCKLES] That's your theory? That's your theory? -That is my theory. -All that? All of that. I've copyrighted that, mate. In fact, Deepak Chopra says... Don't you like Deepak? In my opinion, Deepak is full of more methane than Uranus. [LAUGHING] He's great, isn't he? He's like the rhinestone guru. Why are you dressed as a second-rate character from Pirates of Penzance? Second mate, he's got it. He's very bright, isn't he? Well, he is a professor. Actually, he's a double professor. I thought he looked a bit bi. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] He was checking me out earlier, in the lifts. What are you supposed to be? Well, I'm the Higgs boson, aren't I? Get it? Ha-har, me hearties. -Boson... -Yes? -Is an elementary particle. -Right. Bosun, is the second mate on a ship. So, what's your point? Well, my point... My point is, it's silly. It's not silly. It's a metaphor. They like it. You like it, don't you? [AUDIENCE] Yes. Shall I sing? [ALL] Yes. Excusez-moi, Brian, my audience calls. Stay away from my theory, yeah, Spock?

[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] Stop. You stop. Stop. Stop clapping. Stop clapping. Number one... Number one, there's no such element as a Brian Eno. -And number two... -Well, there should be. [CHUCKLES] Number two, this isn't physics, it's musical. Thanks a lot. -It's not a compliment. -That wasn't a "Thank you". -Noel. -Please, call me Cuddles. That's what Deepak calls me. I call him, "Douchepak". We have such a laugh together. You see, he's like you, he's very clever, but he's got a sense of humour. We can't upset him, he's part Vulcan. He's got no feelings. We'll have to explain to him later, what went wrong. Listen, science isn't a panto. -Well, it can be. -It can't. -Oh, yes, it can. -[AUDIENCE] Oh, yes, it can. Oh, no, it can't. [AUDIENCE] Oh, yes, it can. [NOEL] Oh, yes, it can. No, it can't. [AUDIENCE] Oh, yes, it can. -Well, what's that then? -Where? [AUDIENCE] Behind you. [MEOWING] It's a pantomime cat. A cat, but not just any cat. Schrodinger's cats. [AUDIENCE WHOOPING] -[NOEL] And what's that? -That's a box. Right, so if the cat goes in the box... I might be able to salvage something here. This is Schrodinger's famous thought experiment about a cat in a box. The cat represents elementary particles in an entangled quantum state. So, the idea is, you have a radioactive source in the box. When it decays, it releases radioactive poisonous gas, something like cyanide, into the box. That means that before you open the box, the cat is both, alive and dead. But when you open the box, the cat will be seen to be alive or dead. Like Keith Richards? [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] Well, let's see then, shall we? You wanna see in the box, don't you? [AUDIENCE] Yes. -[DRUM ROLL] -Ta-da! [AUDIENCE APPLAUDS] You see, it demonstrates particles. A cat met an anti-cat and disappeared. There's no such thing as an anti-cat. Oh, really? Oh really, says Mr CERN, Mr Particle Collider, says, Mr "Let's bang things into each other and see what comes out". Oh, really? Says, Mr "I'm a Pirate of Penzance "and I don't know much about quantum mechanics, "but I dress Warwick Davis up as a little cat and put him in a box "and make him disappear." Was that Warwick Davis? Should've got a selfie, right? Well, let's see, shall we? Let's see, yeah? -Let's open the box, yeah? -Go ahead. OK. -[DRUM ROLL] -Ta-da! Hannah Waddingham, everybody! [HANNAH CACKLES] Bless you. Brian, -Hannah's playing Time. -I'm so sorry I'm late. -Traffic on the M25? -Gynaecologist in Hackney. Off you pop, Cox.

I'm Time, Brian. -There's no such thing as Time. -[SIGHS] There's only space-time. Facetime? Space-time. See. According to Einstein's special theory of relativity, published in 1905, time and space are no longer to be thought of as separate entities. They're supposed to considered as an indivisible whole. Called space-time. You see, Einstein said... E equals MC squared. [HANNAH LAUGHS] [EINSTEIN] Hello, Brian. [BRIAN] Hello, Albert. Which means... Energy and matter are interchangeable. Correct, Albert. [EINSTEIN] You're damn right, Brian. Before that, we used to think of space as an arena. What, like Wembley? Well, if you like. It's a good metaphor. But Einstein showed us we were wrong. Absolute space doesn't exist. And... Nothing goes faster than the speed of light. Oh, sorry. In the new Einsteinian worldview, moving clocks run slow, and moving rulers shrink. Right, so, if the Queen could travel at the speed of light... Not that kind of ruler. -Er, if the sheikh of Qatar... -Not that kind of ruler. It's more like a measure. Right, so... Would the Queen shrink at the speed of light? Well, hypothetically, yes. As Her Majesty approaches the speed of light, she would shrink and become more massive. What? She'd become Queen Victoria? Brian, I has a question for you. We know the speed of light, yeah? That's one of mine. Thank you. What is the speed of darkness? -It's the same. -Oh. Coincidence. Hey, guys. Maybe I see you afterwards, yeah? For some crazy fun times. OK. ♪ It's a Higgs boson... Brian, I've actually got a science question. Go on. Can you have sex in zero gravity? Why don't you ask Tim Peake? Tim Peake! [HANNAH STAMMERING] Hi... Can we have sex in zero gravity? -Well... -[GASPS] [HANNAH LAUGHS] As the universe continued to expand and cool, gravity began to take hold of the particles of matter and club them together to become the first stars in galaxies. Do you remember the Sloan Digital Sky Survey? That snowstorm of galaxies? This shows us the distribution of those galaxies across the universe. So gravity pulls everything together. And hold it there for the gravity song. You're gonna love this one. It's really your era. -Yeah, '80s. -Hmm. [AUDIENCE LAUGHS] [MAN] It's all right, Brian, things can only get better.

Einstein did come along with the general theory of relativity. Modifying the Newtonian view of gravity. We now know that space-time is four dimensional, and massive objects curve and warp it. So matter tells space-time how to curve, and space-time tells matter how to move. Now relativity describes everything down to the quantum level. But, at very small distances, the high energies at the subatomic level, general relativity breaks down... All right, who are you? -Who are we? -Who are we? [LAUGHING] -Who are we? -Quantum mechanics. [AUDIENCE LAUGHS] Shouldn't have asked. Hey, carry on, sunshine, carry on. You're doing well. You're doing well. [WHISPERS] Let's go. The centuries since Einstein published his theories have been filled with the most spectacular scientific discoveries. We've discovered a universe filled with wonders, pillars of gas thousands of light-years tall, clouds of bright gas where young stars are born. And we see the deaths of stars, producing pulsars, quasars, and super massive black holes at centre of galaxies. This... Is the CMB. It's the cosmic microwave background radiation. This is the picture of the whole sky, the celestial sphere. It's a stunning image. Now this is the afterglow of the Big Bang. It comes from every direction in space. So this really is a picture of the universe as it was 380,000 years after the Big Bang. This is the oldest light in the universe. These tiny fluctuations that you see as different colours are density fluctuations in the early universe. These are the reasons that we have galaxies at all. So this is a, kind of, a static buzz that permeates the universe. You used to be able to pick it up on old TV sets. A bit like Morecambe and Wise. [AUDIENCE LAUGHS] There's no need for that, is there, eh? As the universe continues to expand and cool after the release of the CMB, matter eventually began to collapse and clump around the denser regions to form stars and galaxies. And the universe was filled with light, once more. Only around 200 million years after the Big Bang, the age of stars had begun. [MUSIC PLAYS] [AUDIENCE WHOOPING] ♪ Baby, let me tell you what it's all about ♪ Lying on your back with your tush hanging out ♪ Hanging out... -♪ All you need is a... -[VINYL RIPS] -[AUDIENCE LAUGHING] -Oh.

Protons being fused together to make helium. -Yeah. -[AUDIENCE LAUGHING] Actually, the oldest stars in the universe are over 13 billion years old. But there's one very special star, which formed 4.6 billion years ago in an outer spiral arm of the Milky Way galaxy. -And we call this star... -The sun. -Sun. -[AUDIENCE LAUGHING] And that was followed in less than a million years by the most significant moment in our history.

But Galaxies can recede from each other faster than light. Because they ride along with space time as it expands and it can stretch at any speed that it wants. Now, there is a remarkable new theory about the origin of the universe called Inflation. We've got good evidence to suggest that before the universe was hot and dense, and what we used to call the Big Bang, the universe was still in existence in a different form. It was doing something else. It was doubling in size, unimaginably fast. This exponential expansion stopped, certainly, to form our universe. But some cosmologists think that it may only have stopped in patches. The bits that stop, form universes through a Big Bang, like our own, but the rest keeps on going. If this theory is correct, it's known as Eternal Inflation, then there's a striking and, I think, mind-blowing prediction. The prediction is that there will be other universes out there. Some being created as we speak. And this process may have been going on, possibly, forever. There may be an infinite number of universes. And if there are, then it's possible that we all could exist somewhere out there in a multiverse, in quite different forms. So, for example, in this universe I'm wearing this T-shirt and I look like me. In another universe I might be wearing this rather fetching off-the-shoulder red dress. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] Now you see, in this universe I'm obviously dressed in this dowdy nerd garb. But in another universe I might be dressed in this blue mini skirt showing off my beautiful, beautiful knees. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] In this universe, I'm me. But in another universe, I might be a beaver. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] In our universe, I can be me, but in another one, a camel in a poncho. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] In this universe, I can be the size I am. But in another, I could be as tall as the Eiffel Tower... -[AUDIENCE LAUGHING] -And French. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] In this universe, I'm looking a little bit saucy and fierce. But in another universe, I might be the queen of the fairies. [AUDIENCE] Aww. Here, the Royal Family, are dressed for a Royal occasion. But in another universe, they might be dressed for a tribal dinner. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] And in another universe, they might be gorillas. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] And in yet another universe, they could all be aquatic sea creatures from space. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] So the speculation is endless and it might seem ridiculous, but it's not. It's illustrating the possibilities of an infinite universe.

Stars die, galaxies die, even universes gradually wind down. The formation of new stars grinds to a halt. We already see evidence of this in our own Milky Way galaxy. So, ultimately, eventually, the universe will -die. -Oh. It's not very cheery-uppy. When stars run out of fuel, there are only three possibilities. Our sun will keep fusing hydrogen into helium for another five billion years or so, until it burns through the last of its hydrogen fuel. After that, it swells to become a Red Giant approaching the Earth's orbit, before collapsing like a dying fire. The core will compact to a planet-sized ember. And it will become a White Dwarf... [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] Sorry? A White Dwarf, it's a technical term. -Like Black Hole. -Oh, racist as well. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] More massive stars will collapse in Supernova explosions that for a few brief moments, are amongst the brightest objects in the universe. The core will be squeezed by gravity into a neutron star, a spinning ball, 12 miles in diameter. Oh, about the size of Oldham. Well, yes, but with the mass of the sun, a sugar cube fragment would weigh a billion tons on Earth. If you took a marshmallow and dropped it, the gravitational pull is so big, it accelerates towards the ground and hits it with the power of an atomic bomb. Hold up, where would the marshmallow come from? It's a metaphor. Oh, like White Dwarf? [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] Brian, does anything become spam? -Spam? -Yeah, spam. Most of the stars we see today in the night sky have planets around them. Data from observatories like the Kepler Space Telescope tell us that around one in 10 stars may have Earth-like rocky planets around them. Perhaps with rivers, seas and oceans. That's around 20 billion potentially Earth-like planets in the Milky Way galaxy alone. And there are 350 billion galaxies in the observable universe. So the question is. Are we alone? No, we're here with you. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] No, what I mean is, is intelligent life common in the universe? It's not even common at the BBC. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] Why are we here? -Eric asked us to come. -Yeah. To be honest, there's no way we'd come if you asked us. [AUDIENCE LAUGHING] Where do we come from? -You've come from Peterborough. -Yeah. Kentish Town. No, we think that life started only once on this planet. Do you know where? Oldham? -No, 3.8 billion years ago. -Oh, Manchester. -[AUDIENCE LAUGHING] -In the oceans. And here it took 3.8 billion years for the first living things to become us. What's wonderful, and, at the same time, a little bit scary, is how frequently our own evolutionary path came close to ending. In the Permian Extinction, 250 million years ago, for example, 96 percent of all marine life became extinct. The odds against our survival were huge. The Earth has been a volcanic hell. It's been a frozen ice ball. It's been an ocean free of land. The Earth has been a target for meteorites. 30,000 objects a day burn up in our atmosphere. And surely, after its formation, a glancing glow from a planet-sized object smashing into our Earth caused the formation of our moon. Against all the odds, there's an unbroken chain of light stretching back 3.8 billion years, just one-third of the age of the universe, to some primordial life form in an ancient ocean. And those first living things have, over geological time, assembled themselves into intelligent, conscious beings inside a superbly complex body that can replicate, evolve, and pass on our genes. With an enormous brain that's learnt to communicate with the finest of its peers, both past and present, and leave a legacy into the far future, through language, writing, maths, science... Panto. Shopping. A Hominid intelligence staggering on the edge of space, pondering the immensity and our next steps. The age of stars will close in a hundred trillion years, and with it, the window for life in the universe will close. Do we define the end of our universe to be the time the last super massive Black Hole evaporates? That takes place in... When? -Roughly? -Yeah, go on. I've got this one. 10,000 trillion, trillion, trillion, trillion, trillion, trillion, trillion, trillion years. -Correct. -Yes. -[AUDIENCE APPLAUDING] -Don't leave me hanging. That means, that means, that life will have been possible for only one thousandth of a billion, billion, billion, billion, billion, billion, billion, billion, billions of one percent of the age of the universe. Imagine that. We live in a tiny, minute, golden bright age. The briefest of moments in cosmic time. We don't know how the universe came into existence, or why it came into existence. But we do know where it is. It's all around us. It's in us. It is us. We are the means by which the universe understands itself. But we may be effectively alone. An isolated island of meaning in an imaginably vast and hostile universe. Ugh, that's a bit of a downer, isn't it? Terribly depressing. That's a terrible ending, Brian. Yeah. Well, no, it isn't.
