Ladies and gentlemen, tonight, a very special performance will be brought to you. You will witness a top-notch magic show. A year ago, I was still performing on crowded streets. It was just me and Phuc, my best friend. Just simple tricks. Enough to make a living. But something was missing in my life. Two, one, hey! I haven't done anything. Let's see! Thank you! May I please borrow your straw? Okay. Thank you! Thank you! Three seconds. That brief moment can completely change your destiny. But if you hesitate and those three seconds go by, that chance may never come back. There was something strange about her. It was as if she was covered in a mysterious fog. I couldn't explain the feeling, but I had to find out. Because she was the inspiration for my new idea. If only she turned around.

Does anyone see her? No! Ladies and gentlemen, as the law of karma goes, in one way or another, we all have to pay the consequences for our misdeeds. I hope everyone had an interesting time tonight. Tung the Sorcerer's Horror Magic Show has come to a close. Well done, everyone. Good performance, everyone. Your performance was great tonight. Darling. Great performance! - You did it like a real ghost. - Yeah. Fantastic! I was truly scared. Phuong! Come out and have dinner with us. - Yeah. - Sounds good! Tonight, I have plans. You always have plans when we ask you out. Hey! I'm taking everyone tonight to Nhan Sushi. - Yeah! - Sounds great! - Our boss is the best! - Let's not go home until we are drunk. Let's go, baby! I'm sorry. Here you are. My God, this girl. All her life, all she ever says is "thank you", then, "I'm sorry". Nothing else. She's been working with us for a year but she's never been out with us once. - She's just shy. - Shy about what? - Let's go. - Ah, my phone. Give me a second. I have an appointment. There's a noodle stall outside. You can take everyone there. Thanks, Phuc! Wasabi. What the heck? Noodles? - We are not eating noodles. - My hair looks like noodles already! - No more noodles. - Yeah! We don't need him. It's fine. We won't eat noodles. My treat. That's so great. Fried flour cake. That's just as bad. Happy birthday, dear! Who are you with today? The thought of you all alone in that house makes me so worried. Don't worry, Mom. I've got Teddy with me. Don't worry about me. We're about to eat the cake. Bye, Mom. Bye, little sis. Hey! Don't tell me you're home alone, watching that same Korean movie about the girl with Alzheimer's. You watch that every year. Aren't you sick of it? It's a good movie. Why do I suddenly miss you so much? Forget about that. Don't bother me anymore. Let me focus on my life goal. "To a world with no belly fat." Bye! Yes. About the hit-and-run car. It's a silver Audi. The license plate is 51A hai, hai, bốn, tám… Yes. My name? It's not important. - She's so weird. - What? Look at Phuong. Yeah, so? Every time we ask her to go eat with us, she turns us down. Now, she's eating by herself like some autistic kid. See that? Weirdo. Maybe she's just shy. Don't you know any other words? Do you just know the word shy? If she's shy, then what else would I say? - Whatever. Look at that face. - So? That face there. It can only be… a criminal, a fugitive on the run. Or maybe a robber. A serial killer who chops her victims to pieces and washes them down the drain. - There she goes. - She's making a run. Where are you going? I'm going home. Today, you don't have any plans, do you? Then, come out and eat with us. I have to go home and do laundry. Do it tomorrow. She's not coming. I think she's coming this time. I think so too. Want to bet? One million. - One million. - You're on. Sorry. Wait! Unless today is the anniversary of your parents' death, you have to come. You're such a dictator! What? I just want to invite you to eat out with us and you're calling me a dictator. I don't drink alcohol. So, drink soda. How can I just drink soda with all that alcohol around? The thing is, when I drink alcohol, I have very bad habits. The thing is, I'm the same as you. I can drink up to seven bottles! You can drink 70 bottles if you want. Fine, let's go. No big deal. One million. Get rid of the sandwich. What's this? This is just 500. I have to pay betting tax. Why is it so high? Ghost! He ran like a bat out of hell. I've never seen anyone so afraid of ghosts like this guy. Now, he's famous for a horror magic show. - Bottoms up! - Bottoms up! Whoever drinks will lose a month's salary! Everybody has their own fear. Always telling this same story over and over. You're right to be scared. Anyone who says ghosts don't exist are liars. Come on, darling. Ghosts don't exist. - That's true. - They do. I'm serious! A whole lot of them. There are ghosts that had sudden deaths, who couldn't move on to the afterlife. And ghosts, there are many different kinds. Nice ones, angry ones, and some really, really scary ones! - Phuc. - Yeah? What's the deal with this? Must be possessed by a ghost. Should we bring her to see a shaman? - Hey. - What? She's coming over. - She's coming. - Dear Lord! She's coming. Here she is. - Phuc! - What? Come sit here and talk to her. I'm tired. My seat is nice and cozy. Have you ever seen ghosts? I see ghosts every day. Old ones, young ones, girls, boys, fat, and skinny. All types. It's a joke! Funny! Have you ever had the taste of misery? Never, right? You're handsome. You have a beautiful model girlfriend. You think you're cool? Not one bit! You! You have no heart! Right here. Just a piece of stone inside! Why? - I told you already. - No. I wanted to be by myself, but you didn't leave me be. - Just listen... - Why? We've all worked together for over a year, right? - That's right. - Why? What now? What do you want from me? I already told you. My name is Phuong. I'm really lonely. I'm really miserable. Why did you do this to me? Why? Phuc! Why? One, two, three. That woman! What does she know about me? She should look at herself. Such a weirdo. Always looking so miserable. What kind of girl drinks 30 bottles? She drank like a fish! Just forget about her. It's not that. I'm just venting. Here you are. Thanks. Call me when you get there. And you, remember to call me every day, okay? Anyway, come back soon. I hate sleeping alone. I know that. I have to go now. Bye. Hello? This is Phuong. I know. I just wanted to apologize. I drank a little too much last night. A little too much? Honestly, I don't remember much. You really don't remember what you did? What did I do? You didn't do much. You only ripped my shirt apart, then… exposed me in public. I'm sorry. But maybe I can buy you a new shirt. What size do you wear? My shirt was tailor-made. You can't buy it. So, you can take it out of my pay. Obviously. You really don't remember anything from last night? Hello? Hey! I... Phuong! Hello? Phuong! Hello? Who's there? I am a ghost. Give me back my shirt. You're crazy! It's Tung the sorcerer. Sorry. This is all I have. It's alright. Do you have any tea or coffee? That's okay. You like camping too? It's just me here. This house feels big. Where are your parents? My dad passed away a long time ago. And my mom and my sister live in America. What did you come here for? Ah, nothing. It's just, earlier, when we were on the phone, all of a sudden, I heard a strange noise. I couldn't call you back, so I came by to check up. I'm fine. Alright. Then it's good. It seems… you don't like talking to strangers? Don't worry. I'll teach you. I'm good at this stuff. Say, if you meet someone new and don't know what to say, you can ask, "What are your hobbies?" "Me, well, I like going to the movies. How about you?" "Me, well, I like eating cakes. Great weather today!" "It's raining cats and dogs." So, What are your hobbies? I don't have any. You really don't have any? What about you? Obviously… magic. Well, I have to go now. Thanks again. Who's that? Who… There's no one else here. There! The kid. By the plants. You see him too? Of course! He sits there like a statue! He's my neighbor's kid. He comes over a lot. For what? He likes to play hide and seek, so he hides in here. He should come inside. Why play outside? - Hey, kid! Want some cake? - Don't! Why not? He's dirty. Kids must be dirty. Leave him be. You should go home now. You really should go. It's best that you go now. I'll take him home later. I'll take him home later. I'm going now! Remember to lock the door! Please go. Boo! He's fast! But this kid is a bit… off, somehow. What? Those little devils came to find you again? Yeah, with a man this time. A hottie ghost? No, a real man, not a ghost. - Who's this? - My boss. Is he cute? Not too bad. Then, what are you waiting for? You're bad. It's not what you think. Is he gay? No, he's not gay. He has a girlfriend. A gorgeous model. Okay, I'm hanging up now. This girl! Only calls me when she has problems. Hello? The kid is in my house! What kid? Your neighbor's kid. The one playing hide and seek in your house this morning. Remember? Hurry over. Hurry over to my house! Have you never seen a naked man before? What took you so long? What's up with that kid? He's a ghost. What are you doing? - I'll look for the kid. - What for? To see what he wants. Hey! Wait for me! - Hey. - What? Can you please not cling onto me so hard? I'm not clinging! If you're too scared, go outside. You made a lot of money, thanks to my idea. What? It was my idea. You just gave me the inspiration. I played a big role. Bullshit. Your role was tiny. Wait! What is this? Jams I made. Really? Want to taste? It's so good! Here. For you. Thanks! Let's check the bedroom. - Go. - Follow me. Okay. Hey! What's taking so long? You like romantic comedies? Yeah, because I'm sensitive. You don't dare to watch horror movies? Hey. You like those bloody movies? I don't need to watch them. My life is already like a horror series, with no ending. What? These cars. They weren't like that before. Hey. I think he's gone. Strange. Usually, after they cling to you once, they just won't go away. Wait. If he's not here, then, where is he? Close your eyes. Closing my eyes, closing my life. Why is it so hard to put together? You have to take the wheels out first. Then, you lift the door. I did it, Dad! Help. Help my son. Please help him. Help my son. My son. What is all this about? I don't understand. I had a really good friend. Her name was Van. We grew up together. - We hereby swear - We hereby swear - we'll be friends forever. - We'll be friends forever. We had many things in common. Went to the same class, sat at the same table. When we got older, both of us even liked the same guy. He's so cute! Then, one day, we all took a field trip. So pretty! This is my good luck charm. What is going on? What is going on? Two, three. Three, two, one. I was saved. But not Van. Urbanization has a great impact on… After that, I started seeing ghosts. Everyone avoided me. People close to me also see ghosts, like me. Like… I saw that kid? Van is doing all that for what? I don't know. Maybe… she wants me to be alone, like the wandering ghost that she is. A living ghost. Hey! You think you made me miserable? Living alone really makes me happy. I can play games, surf the web, and watch movies. I'm also on Facebook and Instagram. I have more than three followers already. How many do you have? No matter what, I will live happily. I feel better. Hey! Van, you devil! You're acting like a sore loser. You want to take over everyone's anger? You're dead already! Just reincarnate! Haunting people for what? Keep haunting for what? Pissing me off! It does feel better. You're not scared? What if she starts haunting you? She has a thing for magicians like you. Thank you. Now, I feel terrified. Sorry! Earlier, I was talking about that evil stepmother Van in the movie I watched recently. I wasn't talking about you, Ms. Van. You're so pretty, Ms. Van! I'm just a young and foolish guy! I'm sorry, Ms. Van. I didn't mean it. Did you do her already? Do what? I have a girlfriend. Anyway, she's not giving me any signals. What is this? You want girls to be the aggressive ones? You want her to bat her eyelashes, pout her lips? Stop! - Sorry, miss… - Little boy, we're just… Don't worry. He'll understand later. Anyway, let me tell you this. Between men and women, there's no such thing as "an ordinary friendship". Why not? Do you want to sleep with her? What? We're friends… What is this sleeping bullshit? Whatever. What do you want? How much? Your total is $4. Thanks, bro. Remember to bring the drinks over too. Thanks! So, you two are dating. That's not dating. He came to your house, ate your cake, you walked around together, then, he drove you home. What do you call it if it's not dating? Maybe he's trying to be kind to everyone. Remember Diem? The love advisor for the Ladies Magazine? She has a lot of experience on romance. Let's ask her. Hello. I'm listening. My friend Phuong I told you about, the one who's haunted by ghosts. Is that you, Phuong? Yes. Hello, Diem. Hello. Frankly, she's having some love issues. So, tell me. I'm listening. Actually, it's nothing. She has a blind date tomorrow. Blind date? I understand now. You want to impress him, right? Listen to me. Men are a species that are extremely simple. The criteria for choosing a girlfriend are only three things. These are… The face must look good. Like mine. The body has to be yummy. Like mine. And lastly, a quirky personality is good, but not too much. Like mine. Women like us belong to the upper 1%. So, we have the choice of who to love. We can choose anyone. Why is that? God, because we're too beautiful. Beauties deserve it all. So, fight on! - Fight on! - Fight on! That girl, Phuong, she's trouble. People who see ghosts are called mediums. In olden times, they were called witches. But Phuong is not a witch. Women are already complicated, but on top of that, this girl is haunted by ghosts. You're right about one thing. Women are so complicated. You're such a wimp. I'm so sorry. Stop, stop. Come down, please. Phuc. Phuc. Where did you find this violent massage place? During the Wrestling Tournament, they advertised 50% off... Geez! When I first saw her, she looked like a frail flower. I told her to do whatever. She didn't have to go so hard. She took my spine out. - Phuc! - What? Do you think men and women can just be friends? No. I only believe in friends with benefits. Friends with benefits? Come here. You're disgusting! Always. Look! I never thought Phuong's type is so old. What do you like to do? I like bowling and good food. I like women who are good at housework. She must know how to cook, to take care of the family. This is very important. Do you like kids? How could I not like kids? Good. I want four kids. At least three boys, to carry the family name. Hey. Check it out. I can read his lips. I'm the owner of the biggest bank in Saigon. I own a restaurant chain that serves the best dog meat in Saigon. Really? You're so impressive! Really? You're so abusive! I was a professional racer. So, I drive a Ferrari. The top-rated dish in my restaurant is dog curry. That's amazing! That's disgusting! She saw us. My friends. Let me say hello to them. Sorry. She's coming out. She'll brag about her new boyfriend. I'll go now. I don't want to be judged. What? A blind date? It was my mom's idea. She said he's handsome, funny, friendly. Funny, at least? To be honest… I'm a bit scared of him. I'll handle this. There's something I think you should know before things go too far. Here's a photo of her two years ago. Actually, no, wait. Here's a photo of "him" two years ago. His name is Phuc. You're telling me that this person and Ms. Phuong are the same person? How is that possible? You don't have to believe me, but you're a successful businessman. I think you deserve something better. I'm just afraid my friend there… fools you. A shame. A damn shame. All done. What did you tell him? Nothing much. I just talked about you. - That's it? - Yes. But you two years ago. What? No need to thank me. Let's go eat. So, what's your type? Good looking? Funny? Easy going? I don't care about looks, career, or money. Just someone brave. Hey. I have a friend who's perfect for you. He owns a martial arts studio in District 4. As brave as can be. He does some acting too. This guy? What's wrong? Are you sure he's not…. He's not…? This guy. Rock hard! I looked straight at them and demanded, "You punks better apologize for insulting my family." "What if we don't?", they asked me. "If not, I will unleash my Judo and teach you all a valuable lesson. Of course, I won't use my hands, I'll just use my right leg, and take you down one by one." Then, what happened? Those punks started laughing, then had a go at me. As I promised, I just used my right leg. Taught those 11 drunks a lesson. Eleven of them? It was actually just two! Two kids! Anyway, still two of them, right? You've got nothing on me. I can do something even better. CPR. Mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. I'm really good at it. I learned it at the swimming pool when I was a kid. Hey! Let's go somewhere else! It's so hot here! Let's go. Let's go somewhere else. Go over there. Let's drink. Rock paper scissors. I think… There's something you should know. You don't have to say anything. Tung already told me all about your troubles. I'm not scared. I don't mind. I know… This isn't easy for you. - You must... - I promise… I'll protect you. Nobody has ever said that to me. I'm listening. You're here? I'll come down. Wait for me. I'll be right back. What's taking him so long? Thien! Are you alright? Stop there! - Thien. - Stop right there! I beg you! Stay away from me! Stay away from me. Stay away. Phuong. You don't want to play? I don't like bowling. Try it. It'll make you feel better. The ball is crooked. Try another one. It's the ball. Lower a little. Lower your body a little. A little lower. More. That's ugly! Hey! Oh my God. This part is not even that scary. Come to my house for a week, you'll see real horror. Why does the ghost keep popping up behind people? If they appear in front of you, you'll die out of fear, right? Hey. Can you sit still? Excuse me. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Let's go! Hold on! The movie's getting good. Don't be afraid. I'm right here. Sit still. It seems… when your true love is beside you, there's nothing to be afraid of. Don't be so sure. Sometimes there's more to be afraid of. What are you laughing at? Nothing. That moment, I really wanted to kiss him. Poor baby! You must've been hungry for too long? How long have you been starved? The last time was in high school. But even then, it was just a kiss on the cheek. What? That's called starvation. Oh God! You're doing it all wrong! You have to learn kissing theory again. In general, there are five types of kisses. Those kisses are… the Hamburger, the AC, the Drain Unblocker, the Candy Kiss, and the Swedish Helicopter. What's the Hamburger? The Hamburger, basically, upper lip, lower lip. And the AC? Allow me. The AC means you tilt your head at 15 degrees. After that, you look at him at 30 degrees. Try it with Teddy. First, 15-degree angle. You're off. That's 35 degrees. Move over a little. Blink your eyes. Blink, blink. Now, kiss. There you go! It's not that hard, huh? You need to practice more. Lots of practice! A ghost boy? Yeah! I couldn't believe it at first, but I saw him. He's super-fast. Running back and forth! Phuong saw him too. Ghosts come to her all the time. They ask her for help. Phuong? Is that the weird girl who works for you? That's right. Then we went to the scene of the accident. We rescued the kid's father. Nowadays, you hang out with her a lot, huh? Not really. It's just because… I know she doesn't have any friends, so I feel sorry for her. I have to get back to work. Bye, honey. Hey. Why, back then, did you choose me? You're the only one who didn't smile when I performed. Sir. Please buy some lottery tickets. I have just a few left. So many left. Did you sell a lot today? - Not too bad. - A lot. What time did you start? Since the morning, sir. - Morning, huh? - Yes. Tada! Oh my God! You two are so lucky! Here! It's yours now. - Thank you, sir! - Thank you so much! Hey. You have a girlfriend. Why didn't you ask her out tonight? Why did you ask me out? She's in Singapore. Ah, so, to you, I'm just a temporary replacement, right? You didn't have to come. How can I not come out when a man calls? Let's go for second round. - Please. - Go. Let's go! Waiter! Bring me beer, please. Is this your second round? My name is Phuong. I'm so tired. I'm so miserable. Why? I already told you! I don't like to drink! Why didn't you leave me be? Why? Why did you do that? Why? I'm fine. I came prepared. I'm good. Try to let it pass. Van? I'm sorry. It's my fault she followed me here. I really don't know what she wants. There are three methods to overcome fear. First method, eat a lot, a whole lot. Second method is smiling big and wide. Or make frog noises. Now, you're smiling. Third method. Accept the comfort of others. Is there any way to help me sleep? Are you sure about this? Trust me. Sorry, Nhi. About last night. I had too much to drink. You don't have to explain. I really should have gone home, but nothing happened between me and Tung. Tung. Can you put my suitcase in the room, please? I believe there's nothing going on between you two because I know Tung is just afraid of sleeping alone. Thank you, Nhi. Tung told me your story. It must be so hard. Even if you two fell for each other, Tung wouldn't be able to handle it. He's just a normal guy. He gets scared easily. And it's hard for a normal guy to be with a girl like you. Am I right? Phuong. You taxi is here. I'm truly worried about you, Phuong. Living the way you do, it must be very lonely. No friends at your side, can't find a boyfriend. And those ghosts coming to you all the time, I think it's terrifying. If I were you, I wouldn't be able to take it. I might even kill myself. Nhi! That's enough. Actually, it's not what you think. My mom calls me all the time. My friends too. They talk to me all the time. Living alone is not as hard as you think. Why should I kill myself? I almost died once. So, to be alive like this, I feel very lucky. Sorry. I have to go. You don't have to show me out. Be honest. Do I look that miserable? Who says I have no family or friends? My mom and sister really love me. They didn't abandon me. Who said I don't have friends? Aren't you and Diem my good friends? Why would I kill myself? I'm happy. This girl. She's tougher than she looks. Are you really happy, Phuong? I'm very happy. Then, why are you sad? Who says I'm sad? Be honest with yourself, Phuong. Why do you keep saying that? I said I'm really happy. Living in that chilly house and you say you're happy? I'm happy. Ghosts coming to you every day, and you're happy? I'm happy. At least, I can help them somehow. So, why are you crying? I don't know. Hey. Phuong. Go on. Smile. No. I can't smile. I'm so tired. I'm not happy. Not one bit. What if I'll be lonely like this till I die? She was right. Nobody dares to love me. Yes. I'm lonely. How could I not be? So many times, for days, I didn't see anybody. I didn't get to speak a single word. The truth is, I don't know how I've lasted this long. Why do I keep saying that I'm happy? I'm doing fine? Because if I don't say that to myself, I'll go crazy. I want to be happy. I deserve to be happy. She's not as good as Phuong. Phuong's so weird. Quit without saying a word. No explanation either. What are you thinking about? Nothing. I'm watching TV. You're thinking about Phuong, right? Sometimes. When I saw you with her, you seemed different. Different how? Like you cared about her a lot. I think… you and I should take some time to reconsider our relationship. Is this a joke? I mean… What I mean is… You're dumping me? Did you know that nobody has ever dumped me before? Is it because I don't spend time with you? You do spend time with me, but… not because of our feelings but for different things. I think we're different from each other. Really different. Different. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to hurt you. You could never hurt me! You two weirdos are perfect for each other! And your lousy jams! Nhi! If only I can be a fish like you, my life would be easier. Even these little plants would do. Hi! Long time no see! Fatty! It's really you! It's Diem. Finally, we meet at last. Am I dreaming? What are you guys doing here? We're here to eat your meat. Oh no. We're here to grill meat with you. What? What are you looking at? What is it? - There's nobody. Let's go in! - Yes. Hey! Why aren't you coming in? This place looks scary. The dress you're wearing is scarier. Let's go! He left without telling anyone. Yes. So, listen. Just stay calm. I'll call him now. What are you doing down there? Go away. You miss Phuong? I told you to go away! I miss her. Oh, shit. Sure you miss her, but missing her like this is just a subjective feeling. Listen. Let me tell you something. When you're close to someone of the opposite sex, the body releases a chemical called oxytocin. It's also called happy hormones. That's when two people miss each other, want to cuddle, want to… each other. What are you saying, Phuc? Listen. But at this moment, you have to put those biological urges aside. You have to use logic. Think. If you fall for that girl, you'll see 800 ghosts a day. Can you handle that? Just keep it simple. We go out and have some beers, then we get a Thai massage. A gentle one. We go home and sleep it off. Next morning, you won't remember a thing. Or… I can call her right now. Hey. If you call, your life is ruined. Hey. Do you miss him? A smile like that is a sign of missing someone like crazy. He has a girlfriend. Forget about him. What did I say? Us women belong to the top 1%. We can have anyone! So, where's your boyfriend? Listen. Men pursue me a lot. They line up around the block. It's just that I enjoy being single. Being single is just great! I'm never without suitors. You're not picking up? Answer it. - Answer it. - Answer it. Hello? - Phuong? - Yes? How are you? Fine. Can we meet? But… I broke up with Nhi. Why? I miss you. Let me ask you again. Can we meet? I'm hanging out with my friends. We can go home now. We can eat later. What did she say? She said she's out with friends. I told you. You're out of luck. Phuong? Hello! The reception here is really bad, that's why my voice sounds different, but I miss you so much! Let's meet up. I'll be there soon. - Yeah! - Success. What did she say now? She said… "I miss you. I'll be there. Wait for me." She wants to see you, you dummy. I told you! Luck is on your side. Oh, shit! You can't go. The first thing we need to do now is fix your hair, put on some makeup, change your clothes, then meet the guy! That's right. Wait. Where and when is the date? You dummy! Why didn't you ask earlier? No problem! Let's get you ready. We'll figure out where to go later. Let's go. Everyone ready? Yeah! Wow! Everyone. You okay? Are you alright? What's the matter? If we're going to be dating, you have to buy insurance. I already have one. One is not enough. You need medical insurance, life insurance, labor insurance. You have to buy all types of insurance. I'll buy them all. I promise. We have to sign a relationship contract. What? What contract? Relationship contract. Everything needs to be put down in writing. If anything happens and you deny everything, then what? Right? Fine. I'll sign it. I want to date, do things that couples do. Like in the movies. Don't you worry. I'm an expert. We can walk around, hand in hand. Bare-headed, we will walk in the rain. That sounds cold. What else? We will both do a dance I like. A dance you like? Don't worry. I'll teach you. Let's go. I'm going to fall. What are you doing? AC kiss. Who taught you these weird kisses? What is this kiss? Swedish Helicopter. I have to tell you, these kisses of yours, only perverts could think of them. Calm yourself. Relax. Close your eyes. What if Van keeps following me? Then we live with it. Why aren't you here yet? This city is too crowded and polluted, but when you're in love, I feel like the city is so sweet. So, go ahead and love each other now. Move in. Live together for a while. After some time, I guarantee you, you won't stand the sight of each other. Let's see if there's any love left. You're getting me excited. I want to move in with her right away. You are really sick. Hurry up! You want to be on the cover of GQ or not? Yeah. What happened? What did the doctor say? Overall, it's not life threatening. Phuong, I'm not just his business partner, I'm also his big brother, his best friend. I want him to be safe. If you two are together, I'm pretty sure there will be one day when he has to die. Let's end this! Can I go pee? You've been staring at me for half an hour. - What's three times seven? - Twenty-one. - Seven times 11? - Seventy-seven. 77777 times eight? A thousand and eighty. How do you know? It's the help center hotline. Call them for the answer. Doctor! Save my brother! Are you crazy? Where's Phuong? Phuong who? Be serious for once. Phuong! She's not picking up. So, you're not telling me? - God, I don't know anything. - Phuc! If you're lying to me, our friendship ends here. After what we've been through all these years, now, just because of a girl, you dare say that to me? If you tell me now, I'll increase your pay. The nerve you have. Ten times more! Why didn't you just say so from the beginning? Hurry. Let's go! Why are you leaving? My mom asked me to come. So, when are you coming back? We… Let's break up. Are you kidding? Don't risk your life for love. It's not worth it. We have a lot of time left. Can we stay friends? Men and woman can't just be friends. I have to go now. Take care of yourself. I just want to say one thing. Do you know how scary it is to be with you? I don't even dare to take a shower, don't dare to sleep. I always have a feeling that someone's watching over me. I'm afraid of everything. But what I'm afraid of most… is not ever seeing you again. What about you? Whenever I think about you being alone like this, I just want to run to you right away and hold you tight! I remember you once told me your life is like a horror movie with no ending. But at least, let the main character have a loved one next to her. Because when your true love is beside you, you don't have to be afraid of anything. I love you. I… I don't love you. Phuong? It is you, Phuong. It's me, Hoang. We both studied at Nguyen Du High School. Don't you remember? Come on. Now, you need to listen to me. It's the best thing for you right now. Forget her! You have to think about the show. Think about the future. Think about… hundreds and hundreds of other girls out there. Understood? Excuse me. Please put on some upbeat music to cheer my brother up. You're too far away - Oh God. - You've gone - This song will make him kill himself. - Too far away from me Don't you know, I'm still waiting here Tomorrow, I will try to forget you Even though you… Have you ever seen her? See who? Van. Van. She doesn't come to you? No. Never. The accident that day… completely changed all our lives. Even until now, I haven't stop thinking about it. So, why did you save me instead of Van? Because that day, you were wearing Van's necklace. Fatty? I know why Van follows me. It's the necklace. Phuong. I think, for a while, I won't be able to contact you. Huh? And Diem also. Sorry. Did something happen? I'm busy right now. I must hang up now. TUNG THE SORCERER The number you're trying to reach is not available at the moment. Excuse me! Please hurry up! What am I supposed to do in this traffic? The number you're trying to reach is not available at the moment. Why are you still here? Do you have an unfulfilled wish or some injustice? You… Someone… murdered you, and that person is here, right now. Phuong! It's me! It's me, Phuong! Don't panic! I'll get you out! Phuong! What's going on? How would I know? This is not part of the script. Phuong! This necklace will bring you luck. It'll protect you. Don't ever take it off. It's so pretty! Wow! Can I have it? No way! So pretty. I'm begging you. I was told to always wear it. It'll be my charm, bring me luck. It'll protect me. Just for a tiny bit, okay? Phuong! Van! Phuong! Van! - Van! Van! - Phuong! - Phuong! - Tung, Tung! - Phuong! - Van! Van. Van! Wake up! Van, don't give up! Van! Van, don't give up. Van! Wake up, Van! Van! Wake up! Wake up! Van! Van! I'm sorry, Van. Three, two, one. Don't give up, Van. - Keep trying. - Three, two, one. Phuong. Phuong! Phuong! Phuong! Stay with me, Phuong! Phuong! Why are you crying? I'm not crying. I want to renew our contract. - Contract? - Yes This time is forever.
