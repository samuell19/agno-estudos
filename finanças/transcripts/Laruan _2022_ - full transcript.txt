Expensive. But, one of a kind sir. I have a specialty supplier called Haven. It?s small. But, very exclusive. How much are the rates of your supplier? They?re a little pricey. But, for a reason. I have a relationship with them... so, I can get up to 75 percent discount on those Italian sofas. And up to 25 to 30 percent off on those furnitures. - Okay. - Just for you. - Separate bedrooms... - Damn, Geoff! I?m telling the story here! Private dressing rooms. Places they can hide in. Soundproof walls. I also have good news for you, love. What can that be? The client is a big fan of your works! And you will make three. - Congratulations, Rene. - Wow, congrats! That?s the only way for me to make money. Darling. We will both make money from your works. Oh, fuck. Hello? What do you want? You, stupid. It?s after office hours. Hey... I?m sorry about earlier. I was just playing. Can we make up already? I was just about to get a shower. How long have you known her? Hey! I don?t know. Probably yesterday. I just swiped right. What kind of house doesn?t have ketchup? Ketchup is red. It won?t match with the design of the house. Sorry. What could possibly match you two? But, you?ll learn a lot from him. Right? I won?t learn anything by just merely posing. Don?t kid yourself. Are you serious? You?ll learn a lot. Do it. You could make some cash. - Are you serious? - Yeah! I?ll pay you. You?re so beautiful. Have there been many guys... and women who told you that? This is fun. Always. Rene is busy. Yeah. Is he busy painting Thea? Wait. What? Your husband Rene is doing a portrait. Okay? It might take weeks or months... Hey. Can?t you see that Thea is the perfect girl for us? - Perfect girl? - Yeah! What?s going on? I?m the perfect girl! You are the perfect girl for me. I love you. Geoff! Fuck! Yes, play! This is all just a game to you? Hey, how are you? - Hi. - Hello. Hello? Hi, sir Rene. You?re too sexy. It?s for you, love. I haven?t met a real painter. Your house is full of art. There?s a lot of paintings in our hotel. I?m a concierge, you know, at the Overlook? Have you been there? Oh my god! This is so beautiful. Geoff, look. It?s so pretty. Emma, I?m really sorry. I wanna go now. - What?s wrong with you?! - Go! And fuck here there! Are you getting laid?! Go to sleep. She showed it to her circle of friends. Then, that?s where it... started to become ?vay? va... What?s the term for that? ?Viral.? It went ?viral.? That?s it. That was it. That?s where I had my exposure. She was able to sell my original works. Are you going to pay, or nothing will happen? You?ll get the money. Just finish the job. Come on, please? Yes, so this will all be over. Mr. Avila! I wasn?t expecting you. But, thank you for dropping by. That?s... It?s not that. I wanted to... I want out. I can?t go on with everything you asked me to do. I know that this would happen. Well... Eventually. You?re in love with Rene. Geoff didn?t mention anything to me. My place is... Geoff didn?t tell you? God, he?s such an idiot. We?re designing a new building. The client wants something new. Geoff told me you have paintings in your studio. He?s seen it. Answer. Please. Fuck you, Rene! Answer please, Thea. Thea, please answer me. How about making a painting of your own wife? You can call it ?Naked female with a cigarette.? After everything I?ve done for you?! The money that I made for you?! You fall for a girl half your age. I want to start all over again and be a real painter. Maybe it?s not too late. You?re really stupid! You are stupid! You have an affair with Geoff. I would have understood it if you were both in love. But, there?s nothing real there. Even you, Camille. You?re not real! You?re a fucking fool! I withdrew my share from our joint account. What have you done?! You can?t leave me. You are gonna die just like your dead Thea! What have you done to Thea?! Thea?! Thea! What happened? Are you alright? Camille was here. You okay? Can I have this? This is very expensive. We'll never meet if not because of you. He was happy when he learned that you paid me. That?s nothing. It?s nothing. Where?d you get this? You left it in the coffee shop. Time to quit, Geoff. It?s obviously not good for me. Yeah? I just don?t know how to quit. Sorry about Camille. Quit now, Geoff. Starting now? Can I? Right now. Any news? That was the police investigator. What did they say? They?ve ruled it out... that the fire was an accident. Let?s go.
