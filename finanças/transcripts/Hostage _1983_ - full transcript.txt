You look like a good sport. - Let's go. - Thank you. Good! Another one. - Bad luck, come on. - You'd even miss your bus home. - Oh, never mind. Come on, who's next, who's next, boys? Come on. - champion. - You, okay. - champion. - Where's your money? - What do you think I'm gonna do, split to Tasmania? - Well, we can all live in hope, can't we? - Fox! Watch this, this is class in action. - [Christine] The king at work. - It's safe, brother, it's safe. (crowd laughs) what do you got, bricks behind there or something? Hey listen, babe, tell me, what's the bullseye worth? - A hell of a lot more than what you've got, buddy. - How do I know it'd be worth that anyway, eh? - It's just something you'll never find out, mate. (crowd laughs) oh, oh shame. - Wear it, moll! - Why don't you try the ghost train? Okay, come on, who's next? Roll up, boys, and try your luck. Any three aces wins a prize. Oh, hello. - Have a good night, Christine? - Sure did. - You're sure making a bit out of this teasing routine, aren't you? - Jealous? - Sure, of the money. Now let's go and spend some, eh? - Hey, you two, how about coming to town for a rage? (all laugh) - [Christine] Not in my work clothes. - No. (sparks buzzing) (dramatic music) (upbeat rock music) (Walter singing in German) - Freda, how much do you know about Walter? - Not much. Keeps to himself most of the time. He just came in off the road one day looking for work. Mum hired him because she reckons Germans are better workers than Aussies. - God, she must be pretty disappointed with you and John then! - You're not wrong! Interested in Walter, eh? He sure is spunky. - Just curious, that's all. - Well, you'd do better with him than that bum Gary. - Gary's alright. Anyway, if you reckon Walter's so great, why don't you make a play for him yourself? - Because, darling, he's got the hots for you. - [Lee] Hi, Chris, hi Freda. - Hi, Lee. Well, there's your lover boy. - Bastard. - They're all the same. - Oh hi, Walter. - He's come to cheer you up. He likes you. - Oh yeah, and how do you know? - By the way he looks at you, that's how. - I look a bit of a mess right now. - You look something quite special. - Well, anyway, how do we know this thing's a he? - Because I made him. - Really? It's not bad, you know? - It would've been better if I made it in Germany. The wood there is better. - Germany sounds a neat place. Mrs. Hoffman's told me a lot about it. - Not bad, you know? Better organised than here. - Well, that wouldn't be hard. - You'd like Germany. - Maybe, I'll never know for sure, will I? - Anything is possible. ♪ Who will wave to the maidens ♪ ♪And dance with them and cheer them ♪ ♪ When the shine of hope is near ♪ - What do you think this is? - What does it look like? - Where's my leather jacket? - Take it and all the other stuff I was stupid enough to buy you. And by the way, what did you do with all that other stuff? - [Gary] What are you talking about? What other stuff? - [Christine] Do you want a written list? - [Gary] You smart bitch. - [Christine] Yeah, I suppose you pawned it to try and impress that old tart. - Oh, you got cheek. See that, that's real gold. She's got class. - So have I. Oh fuck off! - [Gary] Don't listen to her. - Forget him, he's not worth it. You deserve someone better than that. - Oh, I don't need anyone. - Don't you? - No, what I need is a drink. I think it was his grandmother! (all laughing) - It probably was too. - Or his sister. - Yeah. - Hey, girls, you wanna make some easy money? - Oh, piss off, you two. We don't need it. - Cheeky. - That's not very friendly of them, is it? Maybe 100 bucks an hour is above their league. - Piss off. - Hey, you don't want us to piss off, do you sweetheart, eh? - You heard what she said, get lost. - Woo. - Phew. You wouldn't like us to go away, would you now? Come on. - Don't touch her. - And what are you gonna do about it, eh? (punch thuds) (man groans) - Alright, okay, okay, we're going, all right? - Yeah, and don't come back. (dramatic music) (Walter knocks) - Hi, Christine. - Hi, Walter, hot enough for you? - Yes, it is hot. You can use my car whenever you want. - Oh, thanks Walter, but the other guys let me use theirs. - I don't want you to use anything of theirs. - Possessive, huh? - You're too good for them. - But not for you, Walter. Do you want to own me? - I want to treat you like a lady. - How do you know I want to be treated like a lady? C-H-R-I-s-T-I-N-E. - You forgot to dot the Is. (dramatic music) (both speaking in German) - okay, give it to me, come on. - Remember who taught you. - Ooh. (laughs) (dramatic music) (guests chattering) (Walter speaking in German) - Happy birthday. (speaking in German) - Happy birthday, Mum. (crowd chattering) - (laughs) Walter wants to marry me! - Walter wants to marry you? - He said he wants to marry me. (laughs) Hey, Walter, come back. Hey, Walt, can I come in? Walter? What's all this for? - I wanted this evening to be special surprise. - Oh, you're serious! You mean you really meant it? - I love you, Christine. I want you to be my wife. - [Christine] oh, you must be kidding. - I want to take you away from all this. - Why, I like it here. Besides, I don't want to get married. Oh, hell - I was never a daughter, I was a referee. - [Woman] Hey, you two, what's taking so long? - I promise to be a good husband and father. - [Christine] Father? - Yes, I want to have children with you. - Children? Christ, that's just not my thing. I want to have fun out of life. - [Man] Come on! - Won't be a sec. - But I can give you a better life. - Look, being a wife and mother doesn't fit into the life I want. Thanks anyway. It's been a lot of fun, Walter, why'd you have to spoil it? - Don't go. - What's that for? shotgun wedding? - Christine, I'm serious. If you don't marry me, I'II shoot myself. - What's got into you, Walter? Quit fooling around. - Marry me, Christine. - Put it down, Walter, and stop acting like a loony. - Don't leave. (gun clicking) I mean it. - I'm going back to the party. - Christine! (gunshot banging) (siren blaring) - Stop blaming yourself, it's not your fault. - How is he? - He refuses surgery unless you agree to marry him. - She's only a child. - I don't want to get married, but I don't want him to die either. - Time is running out. - Oh, I don't know. I don't know. - It would be a godly act to grant him his last wish. - [Nurse] Dr. Garbling, please go to reception. Sister Newton wanted in ward six. - It's alright, he will live, Mrs. Mare sch. - Mrs. Mare sch? (horn honking) (kids chattering) (horn honking) Mum, how could you? - Hm? - These bills are six months old. (Walter clattering upstairs) - So how long do we have to put up with that then? - It's not easy for him either, Mum. - When are you going through with the annulment? - I'm not. I married the man, and I'm gonna try and make it work. Anyway, it's too late. - What's that supposed to mean? - I'm pregnant. I'm gonna have the baby. - That's a hell of a price to pay for feeling guilty. Do you love him? - I'm trying. - It'll be alright when I get better, I promise. - Thanks, Mum. - By the way, Christine, your grandparents are sending over the baby's presents at the weekend. Are Walter's parents sending over anything? Are they, Walter? - Knock it off, Mum. - Well, I only asked. Anyway, why doesn't he ever talk about them? Perhaps family life doesn't appeal to Walter. - It looks good, Walter. - [Nurse] Nurse Collins, please contact ward nine. - You picked a name yet? - Mhm, Amanda. - [Nurse] Dr. Jones, please go to reception. (Freda speaking in German) - Hello, Mandy (speaking in German). - Well, now say something that I can understand. - Hello, Mandy, I'm your father. Now Mandy knows as much German as you do. - Another mouth to feed. (biker squeals) (Amanda crying) (both speaking in German) (tool buzzing) - Hey, kraut, knock off! - Going after the boss’s job, eh? (both laugh) (dramatic music) - what's the matter? - I don't feel like it, Walter. - You never feel like it lately. What's the matter? Joining forces with your mother? - Nothing is the matter, Walter, it's okay. - It's okay for whom? - Please, Walter, don't make a scene. - A scene? All I want to do is make love with you as husband and wife. - Alright, if that's what you want. - What are you trying to do to me, Christine? Degrade me? Don't you have any feelings for me? Don't you think I have feelings too? I'm not some damned animal. - I'm not saying you are. - You wanted me before but not now. What sort of a crazy world are we living in? - Oh shush, you'll wake Mandy. - Do you love me or don't you? - Oh, look, you know why we got married. - Well, my darling wife, if you don't feel up to it. (glass shattering) we'd better turn off the light. (glass shattering) - Oh for Christ’s sakes, Walter, it can't last any longer like this. (horn honking) where'd you get it? Who's is it? - Yours. For a day. (upbeat music) (horn honking) - You know, I used to come up here as a kid sometimes. Oh, it was good to be above the mills for a change. Better than down there eating it. I promised myself I'd get away from this place one day, but I'm still here. - I'll take you to Germany. There are people there who share my dream for a better life for our children. And I want you to be a part of it. These Australians have no sense of purpose. No pride in their work or love for their country. You don't belong here. - So how do I get out? - I'm working on it. - [Reporter] Fire brigades from every station within a radius of 30 miles battled the inferno for over six hours before finally bringing it under control. Seven firemen were treated for smoke inhalation and exhaustion. While the blaze, spurred on by exploding gas pockets-- - Hey, Walter, isn't that where you work? - Looks like it. - Does that mean you're out of a job again? - There are plenty of better jobs in Germany. - Germany? - I've been offered a job in Munich. We leave Saturday. - Oh, that's great. - [Reporter] Raised solely by public support. The lord mayor publicly praised those community-minded people who gave so generously for the job of their fellow citizens. Three people were injured when two cars collided on the city bypass today. One car overturned on impact and rolled down an embankment, trapping the two occupants. (both speaking in German) cheers. - Cheers. - Let's go, my dear, and we're gonna fly. - [Host] After the first round in which Mr. Binks had the misfortune to misplay his turn, it is Miss Templeton 900, Mr. Binks four - can't go yet. - What do you mean yet? - I'm pregnant. - Pregnant? Well, that's great. Yeah, great. When did you find out? - Christine, you're missing your favourite program. - I got the results back today. - Come on, Christine, it's Hogan's quiz show. - So we shall have our baby born in Germany. - Walter, I'm having an abortion next week. - An abortion without asking me? - [Mum] what are you two talking about in there? - Walter, I don't want another child, not now. - Turn that bloody thing down! - What did you say, Walter? - Christine, you can have an abortion in Germany. - [Host] I'd say this is anybody's game. - I said turn that bloody crap down! - It's all been arranged. Is a couple of days going to matter? - Yes, Christine, it does. We're already booked on a flight. Besides, we have the best clinics in Germany. - [Host] He's getting on the table? He's getting on the table. - We'll take care of it there. - [Host] He said three, two, two, two, one! - How Can you watch this crap? (glass shattering) - [Christine] what happened? - My TV. - You're a mess. Look at the filth you live in. - How dare you speak to me like that in my house. - And what a house. No wonder your old man pissed off. - Stop all this. (Amanda crying) - Christine, we are leaving here now. - [Christine] But Walter... - Christine, how can you go with him after all I've done for you? - After all you've done for me? Oh listen, Mum, I'm gonna make a go of it, not like you. You never tried to keep it together, but at least I'm trying because my daughter deserves that much. - If you leave with him, don't ever come back. (dramatic music) (tranquil piano music) - Mandy, you see? There's lots to see outside. Oh, that's the zeppelin field. (Walter speaking in German) can you hear it? - Hear what? - Listen. - What is it, Walter? - The heartbeat. (singing in German) - Heil, heil, heil, heil, heil, heil, hiel, heil! Heil, heil, heil, heil, heil, heil, hiel, heil! Heil, heil, heil, heil, heil, heil, hiel, heil! - You should've stood up. - For that crazy loon? - Shut up. You embarrassed me in front of all those people. - Are these the loonies you stay out with all night? Where do you go on these mystery tours of yours? - You don't understand yet. - Oh, you bet I don't understand, like a family that lives together that doesn't even talk to each other. - Keep your voice down or you'll ruin my plans. - The new life you promised? - Yes. - oh, Walter, what the hell is going on? And for the umpteenth time what are you gonna do about this? - I told you, I am arranging it. (lively brass music) (all speaking in German) - Mandy, have some. Yummy. - Yuck. (Heidi coughing) (Walter and Heidi speaking in German) - come on, say hello to Auntie Heidi. She's your only auntie, so be nice to her. - Hello, hello! You must forgive my English because it's not so good. - No, it's great, it's really good. - You want to go back to mummy, huh? - Yeah. - Yeah, do you, alright. - Come on, Mandy. (Walter speaking in German) - What'd you say? - I said the next one will be a son. - And what the hell do you mean by that? Walter? Mandy, look, it's Daddy's toys. - Daddy's toys. (gunshots banging) (men shouting in German) (mournful music) (dramatic music) - Mandy. - Look, Mummy. - show Mummy your toy. - It's Daddy's. - Gimme your toy, love. Okay. - [Walter] Been prying again? - Get this out of here. Please, Walter, take it away. Are you crazy, Walter? - You think I'm crazy? It's the world that's crazy, not me. It's the cure for a sick society. But I'm going to save you from all that. Soon we'll be living in a special village where a secret army is training for the day we'll take back Germany. But first, I must prove myself. Relax, it's only a dummy. - Oh, you stupid, raving bastard. Did you enjoy scaring the shit out of me? - Soon you will learn not to be afraid. These will be Mandy's toys and my sons. - Oh no, not my kid. - Abortions are no longer legal in Germany. - What? - [Walter] There will never be abortions in my family. - But you promised me, you said-- - I want a son. - You bloody liar, you bastard! All that crap about German clinics. Why didn't you tell me in Australia? - Would you have come to Germany? - Look at the cars. Look at them. (crowd chattering) - Heidi, I don't know anybody here. - I'm the only person my brother has ever trusted. - Well, you must know where I could go. Oh please, I've got no one else to turn to. - And he will know I helped you. You have to go to Holland, okay? - Oh, anywhere. (horn honking) - Hello. Ready? (dramatic music) when Walter was 17, Hans used him in a bank robbery for the neo-Nazi party. Afterwards, Hans bragged about it and they arrested them. At the trial, our mother pleaded for Walter, saying he was just a boy and did not know what he was doing. Walter yelled at her to shut up and not to disgrace him. He spent four years in jail over that. (Heidi and nurse speaking in German) (doctor and nurse speaking in German) (dramatic music) (Christine breathing heavily) (lively carnival music) - Amanda. No, no! - You killed my son! It was a boy, wasn't it? - [Christine] where's Mandy? (blow thudding) - If you’ve already killed one child, how can I trust you with Mandy? - Please, Walter, I need a doctor. It hurts so much. - It's your fault. - Mandy. - [Walter] You'll have to suffer the consequences. - Mandy. Please, somebody help me! (Christine crying) Walter, help! Help me! (nurse speaking in Dutch) (monitor beeping) (Christine retching) - Him, he stole my Mandy. He's a criminal! (man speaking in Dutch) - He's gonna rob a bank! (nurse speaking in Dutch) - He's gonna rob a bank! He's a Nazi, don't you understand? He's got grenades! (speaking in German) He's gonna blow everybody up! Don't you understand me? (all speaking in German) - oh, he stole my Mandy! (speaking in German) - You understand, right? You speak English? He stole my Mandy. - Go. (watch ticking) (dramatic music) Go through. 28 seconds. 45 seconds. 62 seconds exactly. You are ruining my plans. - Walter. - [Walter] Don't you understand? They say you are a risk. - Where's Mandy? - [Walter] If you cooperate, you shall have Mandy back. If you don't, you will stay here forever. - I'll do anything, anything to get Mandy back. Please. - [Walter] Good, I'll arrange to get you out of here. - Walter! (door thuds) - Don't forget anything I told you. Your life will depend on it, do you understand? Do you understand? Keep your back to the wall, never to a window. When you move your weapon, move it abruptly so it seems you mean business. Watch their eyes. You'll know if they’re planning to get smart. When you leave the bank, turn back suddenly as if you’re going to let them have it. They'll hit the floor like flies. This will give you extra time. Ready? (Walter knocks) The door. Okay, you grab it here. You hold tight there because it kicks up. To cock, you pull once. Okay, come on. Remember, Christine, count to 45 and get out. The cops will arrive in 62 seconds exactly, and they shoot to kill. Come on, let's go. Stupid. (speaking in German) - Five, six, seven, eight. Nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16. (speaking in German) shut up. - Mandy. 17, 13, 19, 20, 21, 22. - Mommy, Mommy! - 23, 24, 25, 26, 27. - Pretty Mandy... - 23, 29. - Pretty Mandy... - 30, 31, 32, 33. 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40. (speaking in German) - 41, 42, 43, 44. Come on, it's time! - Come on. (speaking in German) - Let's get out of here! (Walter singing) (sirens blaring) (speaking in German) - I knew you could do it, I knew it. - Why weren't you in there? Why did you stay outside? - They didn't believe you could do it, but we showed them. - I wasn't meant to come through, was I? - [Walter] Now we show the world. - That idiot you sent me in with. - Now you're one of us. - What? - They can't refuse us now. - Get in. (Heidi crying) (dramatic music) - what if they’ve double-crossed us? - Shut up. (crowd chattering in foreign language) (horn honking) Put it out. I don't fancy Turkish prison. - Don't worry, everything is just fine. (glass shattering) (horn honking) - what was all that about? - Quiet. (speaking in foreign language) Come on, come on. (speaking in foreign language) I wish to apologise for that uncivil and barbaric attack by my poor countrymen. You don't want to go to Iran. They are pigs who will rob you. I would like you to be my guests at my home. - Get in. - I'll give you $10,000 and two of my sons for that woman and child. - My wife and daughter are not for sale. (speaking in foreign language) - You offer an insult to refuse such a generous offer. I want the woman. - Go, Walter! - I want the woman. - Go! - Give me the woman or I'll kill you. (Amanda crying) (glass shattering) - Christine, Mandy! (men shouting) Look out! Grab the bag. Get him! (glass shattering) (Christine screaming) (speaking in foreign language) - Christine! (Christine screams) (glass shattering) - Walter, look out! (Walter shouts) (glass shattering) (Christine screams) (speaking in foreign language) - Walter, help me! (Amanda crying) (Walter shouts) (man shouts) (Christine shouts) (speaking in foreign language) (man screams) (speaking in foreign language) (Christine shouts) (flames roaring) - Blast it! - Break his hands, grab him! Get him off! Break his hands. (speaking in foreign language) (explosion booming) - [Christine] Get him off me, get him off! - [Walter] Mandy! - Pig! - [Walter] Where's Mandy? Christine, where's Mandy? - She cannot enter Iran, she has no visa. - What do you mean no visa? She’s Australian, she doesn't need a visa. - She cannot enter, that's final. - What? - Well, what are we supposed to do? - She must go back to Istanbul and apply for the visa or stay here. - Istanbul, are you crazy? We can't go back there. They would recognise and kill us. - That is not my problem. She cannot enter. You two German citizens, you may enter. Your passports are in order. - Okay, Walter, let's go. Leave her. (dramatic music) Have you gone mad, Walter? They will kill you. (speaking in foreign language) no woman is worth that much. - I want to go home. I can't take any more, Walter. - It will take my people several weeks to fix my papers. If I let you go now, you better stay at the Hoffmans' where I can contact you. - [Christine] okay. - How do I know you'll be there? - Because I said so. Well, there's nowhere else to go. - Don't try anything funny. You robbed the bank, not me. If they find out, you'll be sent back to Germany. And you wouldn't like that, would you? - No. - We will put the past behind us, Christine, and start a new life together. (crowd chattering) - Freda! (Christine crying) well, after that worm Wolfgang ditched us at the border, some American guy picked us up and took us to some dingy hotel in Istanbul. I just couldn't take anymore, you know? I'd had enough. That's when he relented and let me come home. And that's it. Believe me, it's great to be back. - What are you going to do? - I don't know. I feel I owe him my life. Maybe I should just run. (Christine gasps) - Guess who? - I wasn't expecting you so soon. - I wanted to surprise you. I couldn't wait to be with you both. Have you told anybody about Germany? - Nothing important. - [Walter] Not even Freda? - No. - Good. - Freda's been great, you know? She won't take any money for the caravan. - I'll take no charity. We'll show them. - What do you mean? - We will work together. - [Christine] Together? - Yes, just like we did in Germany. The perfect team. Tell me how to turn you on. Shit, cops. Open your mouth, and I'll blow your head off. (officer knocking) - Hello, anybody at home? Hello, anybody in there? Excuse me, Miss, is this lot 24? - I don't know. - Are you the owner of the caravan? - Yeah. - I read your ad. I'm interested in buying the caravan. Are you alright, lady? - Yeah, I'm fine. - Is it all right to have a look inside? - No, no, please it's not the best time. - Sorry, I didn't mean to invade your privacy. - Why don't you call back later? - Oh, I'll call back later then. - Why didn't you give him a written invitation? - Drop dead. - Bloody Freda. You told her about Germany, didn't you? Didn't you? (Christine crying) Relax, it's a safehouse where nobody will find us. Don't worry, she's involved. She's one of us. (dramatic music) (phone ringing) - Hello, who is it? - Mum, Mum, please help me. Walter's gone crazy. - You're married to Walt. - I just can't trust you anymore, can I Christine? (smack cracking) Don't ever try that again. You were running out on me. - Yes, you lied to me. - I've planned the perfect job for us. - Oh no, I'm not gonna rob any more banks. No more, Walter. - You're my wife, it is your duty to obey me. - Your wife, and who's bloody idea was that? (smack cracking) - I could kill you any time I want and nobody would know or care, not even your family. So you better do as I say just like before. It's not a dummy this time. If you don't do as I say, I blow up a school or a hospital or even Freda's place. And you will be responsible for those deaths. (wick hissing) You will be a murderess, how do you feel about that? - Stop it, stop it! (speaking in foreign language) - Take this for Daddy. - Don't take it, Mandy. - We're going for a long ride, Mandy, and this will make sure you don't get sick. Take it, take it. Have some water. There, that wasn't too bad, was it? Don't listen to your mother. - Maybe if I take a walk around the block, I'll feel better. - We've already been around twice. - Just once more. - That's enough, Christine. - [Christine] I can't go through with it. - Either we stick together or we die together. Your choice. Don't get any ideas about shooting me in the back. It's not loaded. (dramatic music) Hands up, higher. Back from the counter. You, you, you, lay on the floor face up. Fill the bag. Quicker. Anybody follow us and I shoot to kill. (gunshot banging) (woman screams) In this one, they write how cool and calm you were. The party will see that I was right about you. - Forget the bloody war, Walter. - Forget it? It's only just starting. That doesn't have to be the only thing we do well together. Does this turn you on? - No, it doesn't, Walter. - But I want a son. - [Christine] I said no! - [Walter] You will! - [Christine] Get off me! - [Walter] You'll do what I tell you! You are my wife! - stop it! - [Walter] You will do it. - [Christine] stop it! - [Walter] You liked doing it with Gary, did you? - [Christine] No! - [Walter] And all those other men? - [Christine] No, no! - You are my wife, you must obey me. (glass shattering) (singing in foreign language) Come on and join us. Something the matter, Christine? - No, everything's fine. I'm just gonna go and make some coffee. - Is this what you're looking for? - I'm not taking any more of your abuse, Walter. - You will do what I tell you. - No, I'm not staying with you a minute longer. - I'll kill us all if I have to. And if you don't stay with me, you will stay with no one. Do you hear? Remember Turkey. I cut the Turk's throat to save you and Mandy. You owe me your lives. I own them now. - I'd rather die than live like this! - Christine. (gunshot banging) (Amanda crying) - oh no, Walter, no more. - Walter. - [Amanda] Mummy! - [Christine] I can't take anymore. - Mummy! - what am I supposed to do with you now? - This woman has made you crazy. - [Amanda] Mummy! - Yeah, crazy. You are a danger to the party (speaking in German) - we don't need you. We'll do it by ourselves. We'll show you. - [Christine] No more. - We'll show everybody. - [Reporter] This is the 2Kw Midday News.

However, maritime officials are confident that the spill can be contained if the weather conditions remain favourable. West Germans are today rejoicing at the news of the mass suicides of leading members of the notorious Baader-Meinhof Gang in the top security prison at Stammheim. Andreas Baader, the reckless leader of the terrorists, shot himself in the head with a revolver smuggled in by his friend. - suicide. - [Reporter] The police believe the suicides were a... - I know who killed them. - ...well-laid out plan. - That gang operated better in jail than out. - [Reporter] Baader's mistress in terror Ulrike Meinhof had taken her own life in-- - Now there was a relationship that worked. - [Reporter] Left-wing supporters are claiming the gang were murdered... - I was in jail with him. - ...on government orders. - Too bad she was on another team. - The government in return has demanded an inquiry. - [Reporter] others in the suicide pact were Gudrun Ensslin, who hunger herself in her cell and Jan-Carl Raspe-- - Now Germany will need new heroes. - [Reporter] Who shot himself in the mouth. Both were founder members of the gang. The state road toll rose by three last night with three deaths. - Deal? - Yeah, deal. - You mean to say you found a buyer for that bucket of shit? - Where do they think they're going? - He said Germany. (dramatic music) - Free at last! - It's mine. - No, Mandy, wait a few years. I thought I told you to take the rudder. Take the rudder. I won't tell you again. Come here, Mandy. - I want Mummy. - Mandy, I said come to Daddy. Mandy, I said come to Daddy. What's wrong with this fucking wind? When you want it to blow, it doesn't. When you don't, it does. (dramatic music) Even nature is against me. - Mandy, come here. - Mandy, come to me. - Mandy, show Mummy your new toy, come on. - Mandy, I show you how to play with it. - It's mine. - Stay where you are. So it's games you want to play. I'll give you a 10-second start, then I'll hunt you. - Oh no. - What is it, Christine? Why are you always resisting me? Five seconds. - I'm not gonna play your stupid games anymore, Walter. - We could've had it good in Germany if you’d just cooperated. Three seconds. But you never even tried to understand. One second. I've always loved you, Christine, don't make me hurt you. - Well, I've never loved you, Walter. I hate you, and you can't hurt me anymore. (dramatic music) (Walter shouts) - Help! Christine, help! Help, Christine, help! Help, come back! Christine, come back! Please come back! Save me, Christine, please! - Daddy can't swim. - Please, Christine, come back! Help me, Christine, please! - Daddy's gone. - Please save me! Save me, Christine, please! - [Amanda] Poor Daddy. - Come back please! Come back, Christine! Help, please! (smack cracking) You stupid bitch, why did you take so long? (dramatic music) - okay, now we're even. Mandy, come here to Mummy. - Mandy (speaking in German). - Mandy, I said come here. - In German. - What are you doing? Turn around. I said turn around. - Hang on, Mandy. (boat rumbling) - Mummy! - Stop, Christine. Christine, come back or I shoot. (gunshot banging) stop, Christine! - Johnny, get out of the bloody water! (gunshots banging) come on, get out! (gunshots banging) - [Man] This guy's nuts! (dramatic music) - Hey, lady, over here! (people shouting) - [woman] somebody help her! Please, somebody get her out of the way! (people shouting) - Christine, stop! I've got your head in my sights, do you hear? - Do it. (upbeat music) (dramatic music)
