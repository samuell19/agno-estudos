A moment of faintness.

If you were mine, I'd watch over you every day what are you saying? No one looks after me because no one in the world loves you... - No one? - ..Except for me how true, I had forgotten that great passion! You're laughing have you no heart? A heart? Yes, perhaps... Why do you ask? If you had, you wouldn't make fun of me - are you serious? - I'm being honest have you loved me for long? Yes, for a year like an otherworldly vision, you appeared, one happy day Since that day I've lived for love The love that is the heartbeat of the universe Mysterious, exalted, both pleasure and pain If that's true, keep away from me, since I can only offer friendship I cannot love, or endure heroic passion I am simple and straightforward you must look for someone else you'll have no trouble forgetting me What the devil are you up to? - Making merry - Fine, stay there no more talk of love do you promise? - I'll do as you say, and go now - Must you? Take this flower - why? To bring it back - when? - When it has faded - tomorrow? - Very well, tomorrow what happiness! Do you still say you love me? I love you so much - Are you leaving? - Ll am - farewell - I desire nothing more It is daybreak and we must leave thank you, madam, for such a splendid party The town is still revelling. Pleasure rolls on its way in slumber we'll replenish the zest for further joys How strange... His words have stayed in my heart Would it be a mistake to fall in love? What is it I really feel? No man has ever yet touched my heart to love and be loved is a joy I've never known can I refuse it for the empty pleasures of the way I live? Perhaps he's the one my solitary heart liked to imagine in all his mystery Modest and vigilant, he came here when I was ill he caused another fever, waking me to love The love that is the heartbeat of the universe Mysterious, exalted, both pleasure and pain It's madness! It's empty delirium! A poor woman... Alone, abandoned to this teeming desert called Paris what can I hope for? What should I do? Enjoy myself, then perish in the whirlpool of pleasure I must always be free, rushing from pleasure to pleasure I want my life to follow the path of enjoyment as each day dawns, as each day dies gaily I turn to the new delights that make my spirit soar Love is the pulse of the whole world yes! Love! Mysterious, exalted both pleasure and pain I can't enjoy life away from her it's three months since violetta left her easy life for me those grand parties where everyone was a slave to her beauty In these lovely surroundings she has forgotten it all for me with her I feel reborn. The breath of love has restored me I've forgotten the past because of her happiness She has tempered my eager, youthful passion with her smiling, gentle love since the day she said, "I want to live faithfully with you" I've forgotten the world and almost feel I live in heaven - Annina, where have you been? - To Paris - who sent you? - The mistress why? To sell the coach and horses and all her other things - what's this? - It's expensive living here - why have you said nothing? - I was sworn to silence - how much do we need? - One thousand Louis go now. I'll go to Paris myself say nothing to your mistress I can still make amends I am so ashamed at how mistaken I've been but now the truth has roused me from my dream for a little while be calm in my breast, o cry of honour in me you shall have a sure avenger I shall wash away this infamy - Where is Alfredo? - On his way to Paris - when will he be back? - Before dark, he said to tell you how strange this is for you - very well I'm expecting a businessman show him in as soon as he arrives flora has found out where I am. She's invited me to a dance tonight she'll wait in vain - a gentleman has arrived - The one I'm expecting - Mademoiselle valéry? - Yes? - I am Alfredo's father - You are? Father of that reckless boy who risks ruin over you I am a lady and in my own home allow me to leave you, more for your sake than for mine such manners! - However... - You have been misled he intends to give you all he owns he hasn't tried to yet: I would refuse but all this luxury? No one else knows this... But you shall know the truth I see... do you mean to sell everything you have? Then your past is a reproach to you the past is over I love Alfredo now god has wiped out the past: He knows of my repentance - Fine sentiments indeed - How kind that sounds I have a greater sacrifice to ask of you please don't go on. It must be something terrible I knew something would happen... I was too happy Alfredo's father pleads on behalf of his two children two children? Yes God gave me a daughter, as pure as an angel if Alfredo refuses to come home to his family the man she loves and who loves her the one whose wife she was to be will break the chain that was to bind them in their happiness please don't allow her love to be turned into tears Surely you won't harden your heart against my request I see: You want me to leave Alfredo for a while it would be hard for me, but... - That's not what I'm asking - What more can I offer? It's not enough you want me to leave him forever? You must - no, never! You don't understand how much I love him I have no friends or relations, no one else in the world Alfredo has promised to be everything to me you also don't know that I'm dying the end is quite near leave Alfredo? It would be such torment I would rather die It's a great sacrifice but please hear me out you are young and beautiful but in time... Please stop: I do understand, but it is impossible for me He is the only one I love perhaps... but men can be fickle oh, heavens! When time has faded your charms He may become bored with you. What will happen then? You will have no peace, however great your affection Because your union has not been blessed by god It's true! Put aside this tempting dream Be my family's guardian angel Violetta, please, there is still time young woman, it is god who has inspired me to speak this way So a fallen woman has no hope of salvation However forgiving god may be, man will never relent Tell your daughter, so lovely and pure That there is a victim of misfortune Who had one hope of happiness She sacrificed it for her and now she will die Let your tears flow I know I am asking for an immense sacrifice I share your pain be strong, your heart will stand firm - What must I do? - Tell him you don't love him he won't believe me - then leave him - He'll follow me then... Embrace me as your daughter - that will give me strength You'll have him back soon, but unhappy beyond words he will need your comfort - what are you going to do? - If you knew, you'd try to stop me what can I do in return for such generosity? I am going to die, but I don't want him to curse my memory someone must tell him how much I have suffered no, you must live and be happy heaven will have pity on your tears he must know that I sacrificed a love that will be his until I die You will be rewarded for sacrificing your love and in days to come you will be proud of so great a love Someone's coming. You must go now - I am full of gratitude - Go now perhaps we'll never meet again be happy farewell! God give me strength - You called me? - Yes. Deliver this in person - oh! - Say nothing, go quickly Now to write to him What shall I say to him? Where will I find the courage? - What are you doing? - Nothing - you were writing? - Yes... no - who were you writing to? - To you give me the letter - not yet - I'm sorry, I'm preoccupied - Why? - My father has been here - Did you see him? No, he left an angry letter... But I still expect him he'll fall in love with you when he meets you don't let him see me. You calm him down I'll throw myself at his feet. He won't want to part us then we shall be happy, because you love me... you do, don't you? So very much but why are you crying? I couldn't stop my tears but I'm calm now see, I'm smiling I'll be there, among the flowers... Always close to you Love me, Alfredo love me as much as I love you Farewell! She lives only for my love It's late. Perhaps my father won't come today madame has gone. There was a carriage waiting it's on its way to Paris now. Annina went on ahead - I know, don't worry - What can it mean? Perhaps she's selling more things: Annina will stop her there's someone in the garden. Who's there? - Monsieur germont... - Yes a lady in a carriage gave me this letter for you From violetta... Why am I so apprehensive? Perhaps I'm to join her I'm worried... oh, heaven! Be strong "Alfredo, by the time you read this..." My father! My son, your pain is great come home: Be my pride and joy again Who has made you forget the land and sea of provence? What took you away from your blazing native sunshine? Remember how happy you were there you will find peace there once again God led me here to you You don't know how much your old father has suffered While you were away, his home has been desolate Now that I have found you again, my hopes have been fulfilled if you still have a sense of honour... If I have really found you again... Then god has heard my prayers Have you nothing to say to your loving father? My heart is in turmoil. Leave me alone - leave you? - I want revenge hurry, we must be on our way it was baron douphol - are you listening? - No! Have I found you in vain? I won't reproach you. We'll forget about the past love is my guide and it forgives everything your family will rejoice don't deny them their happiness come home and console your father and your sister She's at flora's party. I'll go to avenge this insult what's that you say? Stop! The viscount is bringing some guests in costume I've invited violetta and Alfredo haven't you heard?

Our friends have arrived We read the future in your palm we can see everything in the stars we can tell what the future holds Let's see You have a number of rivals, madam Marquis, you're hardly a model of fidelity still flirting? I'll make you pay what do you mean? It's an utter falsehood! A leopard never changes his spots my dear Marquis, you'll be sorry if it's true Let's draw a veil over the past what's done is done. Look to the future We are matadors from Madrid, heroes of the bullring we've come to Paris to enjoy the carnival we'll tell you a story about what sort of lovers we are yes, yes, you fine men, tell us! We are eager to hear you! Then listen! Piquillo was a brave matador from biscay with a strong arm and a keen gaze, he was master of the bullring he fell madly in love with a girl from andalusia but this is what she said to him... "I want to see you kill five bulls in a single day "if you do, I'll give you my hand and my heart" the matador said yes, and set off for the bullfight he strewed the arena with five bulls Bravo to the matador, who showed his daring this was how he proved his love amid the applause, he returned to his sweetheart he took the coveted prize into the arms of love this is how matadors win the ladies' hearts here we're more restrained and happy just to flirt yes, let's try our fortune clear a space for the gamblers - Alfredo, it's you - Yes, my friends - and violetta? - I don't know how casual! Bravo! Now, let's have a game! - I'm glad you've come - I couldn't resist the invitation I'm pleased you've come as well, baron - germont is here, do you see him? - Heavens, it's true don't say a word to him.

His hatred is stronger than my words What do you want? Leave this place. You're in danger I understand: You think me a coward? - No, never! - What are you afraid of? - The baron - It's life and death between us if 1 kill him you'll lose your lover and protector at a single blow - is that what's frightening you? - What if he kills you? That's the only thought that puts the fear of death into me - me? What's that to you? - Please leave at once I'll go if you promise to follow me - no! Never! - No, never! Go, you are wicked!

Very well, I love him everyone, come here you called us? What is it? Do you know this woman? You mean violetta? Do you know what she has done? - Oh, don't! - No This woman spent all she had on me like a coward I blindly accepted it all but there's still time to wash away the stain I call you all to witness That I have now paid her back what you have done is shameful! To strike down a tender heart that way you have insulted a woman! Go! Get out, you revolt us A man who offends a woman, even in anger merits nothing but scorn where is my son? I don't see him here you're not Alfredo What have I done? I am ashamed jealous madness, love deceived, ravaged my soul, destroyed my reason she'll never forgive me I couldn't run away from her. My anger drove me here now that I've spent my anger, I'm filled with remorse alone I know the true devotion this poor girl hides within her breast I know her faithful heart that's vowed so cruelly to silence Alfredo, how should you understand All the love that's in my heart? Though you repay me with contempt You don't know that I have proved my love what have I done? I am so ashamed the day will come When you will understand May god spare you then from remorse Even in death I shall still love you Annina? - Did you call? - Were you asleep? Poor you - yes, I'm sorry - Give me a sip of water - Look outside: Is it morning? - It's seven o'clock let some light in Doctor grenvil what a true friend. I want to get up. Help me So kind, to think of me so early how do you feel? My body is in pain but my soul is at peace a priest called to comfort me religion consoles those who suffer - and last night? - I slept peacefully that's a good sign: You'll soon be well again doctors are allowed to lie out of pity - goodbye... until later - Don't forget me How is she? She has only a few hours left - Take heart now - Isn't today a holiday? Paris is going wild. It's carnival god knows how many are suffering while others rejoice how much money is left? Twenty Louis take half, and give it to the poor - that leaves you almost nothing - It will be enough - see if there are any letters - What about you? I'll be all right, but don't be too long "You kept your promise. The duel took place "the baron was wounded but is getting better "Alfredo is abroad. I've told him myself about your sacrifice "he is coming to you for forgiveness: I shall come too "take care of yourself. You deserve a better future "giorgio germont" it's too late I wait and wait but they never come how I have changed. Yet the doctor tells me to hope but with this disease there is no hope Farewell to the happy dreams of the past The colour has gone from my cheeks I don't even have Alfredo's love To comfort and sustain my tired heart Look kindly on this fallen woman, lord take her to you and forgive her Everything is at an end Soon joy and grief alike will be over the grave marks the end for everyone Neither tears nor flowers will fall on my grave There will be no cross with my name Look kindly on this fallen woman, lord. Take her to you and forgive her Everything is at an end Make way for the quadruped lord of the feast his head is wreathed with flowers and vine leaves make way for the gentlest of all horned beasts greet him with horns and pipes people of Paris, give way to the fatted ox's triumph not Asia nor Africa ever saw a finer he's the pride and boast of every butcher lively masqueraders, crazy young boys hail him, all of you, with music and song!

Breath of my life and beating of my heart my tears should flow with yours but I need you to be stronger than ever don't close your heart to hope - calm yourself, violetta - Oh, Alfredo - your sadness is worse to me than death - How sad an ending to our love and my life Ah, violettal - you, monsieur? - Father! - You haven't forgotten me? To fulfil my promise, I've come to embrace you as my daughter most generous girl! You've come too late: Yet I'm grateful see, doctor, I'm dying in the arms of my only friends what do you mean? So she really is dying do you see her, father? Don't torment me. I'm already filled with remorse her every word is like a blow I'm a foolish old man: Only now do I see the harm that I've done come closer listen, my beloved Alfredo Take this picture of me in days gone by May it remind you of the woman who loved you so Don't talk of dying. You must live god didn't bring me here to break my heart If a chaste young woman in the flower of her youth Gives you her heart, marry her: I want you to Show her this picture and tell her it is a gift from someone who is praying for you both in heaven Death cannot take you from me so soon!
