The first frost by the lakeside and the look of the forest is suddenly bare. The sun reflecting on the fallen leaves and the whispering branches shows a completely transformed place. When I first met them was when the forest showed its last beauty in that season. LOVE HUNTER A duck? A lot less ducks around here. But I got this one today! Thanks. It's been fun. Oh... Um... Kazuo! What are you doing? It's okay. I'll wipe it off myself. That was fast. How is it? Quite delicious. We have a very good wine for you. - Here. - Thank you. It'll make for a good memory. I might not be able to come here again. Oh? She said she might not ever come back. This is her fifth one. Always a different guy, always the same thing. So you're also after her? Idiot. Do you really plan to marry? I will. You'll regret it. Don't say anything more. We need to remain apart. There's nothing left for us. Maybe so. But I wanted it to be like this forever. I don't want to think about it. Ah, stop the car! Where to? Tokyo. Get in. But... Come on. Okay, thanks. Hey... What do you think our relationship is? No idea. We're cousins, actually. We thought you were married or lovers. We've done this for many years. But... This is our last vacation together. Kind of a boring place, right? Especially for a young girl. Not at all. Are you classmates? Yes. You two are cute. Want one? I don't smoke. You drink? Sure. Have you been together long? No, not really. You spend the night together? No... Well, it's not strange if you're lovers. I'm getting out of here. What's wrong? What a weirdo. Indecent! Out of everything, Kazuo, getting in someone's car, you don't know about. What happened to them? Leave them. They don't have any manners. Boy... Woman... Sorry... keeping you waiting like this. Kyoko's not here. Go home. Go on. Go home! Miss... I have something important to tell her. Let me see her. You are no longer allowed here. And you know why. You must consider her feelings. If you cheat on me with someone younger, I will never give you money again. I'm all yours. I will marry for you, Jun. The guy that I'll marry is very rich. When I marry, from the top of your head, I'll will decorate you with diamonds all over. I'll put sapphires here. And here. Remember... I'm marrying for you, Jun. I don't want to let that guy have sex with you. Boy! Boy! Boy! What's wrong? Something's wrong about you today! I'm not in the mood. That's not like you. Leave me alone, good boy. Do you hate me now? What's wrong, Jun? You're ignoring me. They're really doing it. Kyoko's acting strange today. - You think so too? - Yeah. She's usually all over me. She should marry who she loves. Stupid Kyoko! See you later, honey. Kazuo! Stop. "The only good thing about you was your virginity. That's how my husband teased me." What does that mean? I read too many dirty novels, I guess. Here. Moaning. Whipping. Getting wet. Doing it! No... Hey, Kazuo... Lately... -You never come to college. -Yeah. That damn Kawaguchi next door, he's doing that every day. It turns you on. Hello? Yeah, wait a sec. Hey, Kazuo! Phone, from a woman. Hello? Yes. What? Now? Sure. Is that so? Okay. I'll be right there. I'm done. I'll be right back. Her again? Yeah, I forgot something in her car. I've been waiting for you. I'm her mother. You're young. Your age? Twenty. I see. Don't get too involved, please? Here it is. Did she tell you something? My mother? "You're young." "How old?" "Don't get too involved, please?" Right? Just like always. Yes. Like always. But... it's the first time with someone like you. Am I better than her? Tell me. I haven't slept with Hisako. No way. She's so young. Can she do what I did to you, this Hisako? Stop talking like that. I always thought you younger guys had sex all the time. Kind of a surprise. Oh. Let's do it again. Not yet... Turn off the light. What's wrong? Take me. Stop! I can smell that bitch! Disgusting... Don't touch me! I totally lost everything yesterday. How about you, Kyoko? I bought them using the racing forecast. - And? - All my horses lost. I think Mr. Kubota's from Radio Kanto is the best. Sadao Tokoro's horse bets are also good. It's nonsense to buy them with someone's forecast though. We should use our own intuition. By the way, what happened to that student? Mr. Chicken? Chicken? Read this. "They had sex the day they met. "However, it was like a ceremony. "He was inexperienced and unskilled. "His only strength was his youth. "He was selfish and rough like a beast. "He put it inside when I wasn't wet "and misunderstood my moaning in pain as pleasure. "He climaxed after a few thrusts. "It was almost like a rape "and I felt disappointment rather than anger. "I was also excited that I found joy -"to train... -Good morning! -"This young man... -You're early! -"Sexually. -My class was canceled. "I was like a mother to him and like a prostitute." So you discovered about my part time job from Kazuo? Oh, you know already? I know what happened last night. Oh, really? I have nothing to say. A rich wife like you and I will never be the same. Your filthy ways have nothing to do with me. What the...! You heifer. You think everything you do is righteous. Don't talk like that. Hisako, a call from Kazuo. Hello? I don't want to see you. No. It's not that. Anyway... I don't want to see you. Bye. It's me. Kyoko. You finally called. It was hard waiting for you to call. But I... Are you taking sleeping pills? It's not good for you. Today. I decided on my marriage day. Won't you congratulate me? That stern voice of yours, even though you should be happy for me. Are you listening? Hideyuki... Say something! I want you! Then take me! Like always. Hard... Can I come over? No... I... I'm gonna go crazy. You remember, right? Your parents had passed away. And you were brought to my house. And we were like siblings. And even more, for me... it was the happiest time of my life. But... Father, like this... How you... My kids... ...will someday suffer... Father... We are... ...the beasts. Father! No way... my grandfather and mother... and you and I... Kyoko. Let's marry. Even though we're cousins. If we love each other... But I can't. It scares me! If I'm with you any longer, I'll go insane. Father... Stop it! I don't know what she's thinking, but she'll soon marry. So for her, it will be a beginning or an end. Today is the last time. You understand? Kyoko... Think it over. Marrying a man you don't love... Kyoko! Kyoko! Grandfather... Oh... Mother. Beasts. Hurry! So good... Good... Hurry... You came. I'm... I'm glad... Ice... Give... Give me ice. Hurry! When I got her wedding invitation, it was a half month ago. Of course I didn't go. What was she trying to do? She even sent me a change of address note. Hey! When'd you get that? A while ago. Got it from a pachinko. Don't do stuff like that! Hey, Kazuo. You said you're leaving your boarding house. Yeah. What will you do? Got nowhere now. Really? How about come to my place? - What? - Think it over. I don't have to think at all. If you'd let me... Sure. -How about tomorrow afternoon? -Sure. I'll meet you at school. I'm almost done. Can you wait? I have my part-time job now. I'll take tomorrow off. Bye. I...love...you... Come on! No decision. No hesitation. I'm the defeated one. The trapped victor. Like a lover in a romance. Hisako! It's been a while. What's wrong? Treating me like a stranger. Want to eat together? It's been a while. Won't you come with me? We'll ride with you. Hisako. It's fine. You can move tomorrow. After eating, we were invited to her newly bought beach house. It was my wedding gift. My husband's. What are you thinking? Why didn't you turn her down? I didn't tell you, but she slapped me once. I felt horrible. But... But I couldn't hate her because I saw her true self. I... I wanted to talk to her again. This may sound stupid. It's an important thing for women. I brought your clothes. Thank you. Mother. When Hideyuki comes, take him to the main hall. Kyoko... You just married. I understand. Take those two home quickly. If I'm not mistaken-- Stop it. I'm your daughter, after all. Sorry for the wait. Let's have a nice drink together. Well, we haven't talked about my wedding at all. In other words, I finally found a place to call home. Huge wealth and freedom. Of course my husband is perfect. He's at the top of the financial world. Do you love him? Your man? Of course... I don't love him. But... being happy without love, I can't imagine it. You're right. For someone like you. In other words, you're just young- But I think that's great too. You don't understand what love is. Sometimes we need to escape to marriage. Are you lying to yourself? This was the first time I talked to her seriously, but I quickly knew... she really loves her cousin Hideyuki. The emptiness, she wants to share it with someone. Even though I knew it, I accidentally said it. But if you love Hideyuki... If she wrongly married another-- Shut up! You don't know. You don't know anything! You are using your own standards to interpret people in your own way. I hate women like that. You can't be a woman like that. With such a cute face. Let's talk it over more. Together. We should get to know each other. There, have a drink. A girl like this, I'll never forgive. Wake up. That old slut! I know! The smell of her! I want to puke! Kyoko... Don't drink so much. I need it. I want to be drunk. Kyoko. Kyoko! See you. Hey, this is getting boring! Let's have fun! You can't just lie there. I will make you feel better. I'll take care of her. Alone in the leisure room, I got a phone call from him. I felt nostalgic. I wanted to jump to him. I began to cry. Once I had doubted his love, but for now, I've put everything into him. No! Hisako... Hisako... Hisako... Hisako... No! Kazou... I'm sorry. This is all I could do. Hold me. Take me away! This is fine. Who needs happiness? It's different for each person. Kyoko. I won't leave you. Kyoko. Kyoko... What happened to Kyoko? I wonder if I'm like her. You're not. You're not, Hisako. Maybe. Why? Because I'm a woman. Kazuo. Take me again! END
