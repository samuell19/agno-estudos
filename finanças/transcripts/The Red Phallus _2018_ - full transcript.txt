It's time to wake up. Wake up, Sangay. You're getting late for school. Sangay, wake up, you're getting late for school. Sangay? - Is that Sangay? - Yes. Why are you late again? How many times do I have to tell you to come straight home? Anyway, Aum Zam's new house is being consecrated tomorrow. Go and reach the phalluses, she wants to hang them down early tomorrow. Take them right away. Tell her I couldn't come as a client has come to get the thangka and that I'll attend the ceremony tomorrow. And come straight home. Don't loaf around like a stray dog. Is your mother home? What's that stupid grin for? Why are you making that face? Haven't you seen me before? Where is your mother? - She is inside. Give these phalluses to your mother. They're my father's gift. They'll ward off the evil spirits. Tell her he couldn't come, as our cat died last night. He went to the riverside to bury it. Sangay, wait for a moment. Why couldn't Ap Atsara come? Come in for a while. It's inauspicious to leave without coming in... have a cup of tea. It's late, I have to go. It's not that late. At least have some tea. I can't. Ok then, tell him to come tomorrow by any means, and you should come too. Of course, Aum Zam, we will. It's your new house. You should come tomorrow. Ok, sure. Oh, I left your things with your son. Ok. These fucking phalluses! Sangay, you'll end up breaking everything in the house. For once, can you be a little bit careful? Soon we might have to eat from the floor. I always tell you to wash your hands straight after dropping things, it might rinse off your bad habits. Try it for once. Sangay, wake up. You're getting late for school. I have to wake you up every morning. I wonder where those monks are going? Monks? Are you crazy? You've started to hallucinate again. I see only the river and the valley. Couldn't you find any other paper to make your plane? You're planning not to do your exams again. Why don't you do the exams for me? Don't lecture me. Why did you keep me waiting here for hours? Fuck! I doubt anyone can get out of this paradise. I'm tired of watching these mountains. I'm fed up of driving this old tractor and hearing its noise. Before I get fed up of you, shouldn't we leave this godforsaken place? I'm also sick of coming to this spot. We should leave this place and go to Thimphu city. I'm sure I could find a decent job there. Even If I don't get a job I could always drive a taxi. You know I'm just a girl. I don't think I can. How can I leave my father alone? You always say, "I'm just a girl, I'm just a girl." I thought we could start a new life. Do you understand? But I wonder when you're going to start making your own decisions. The only thing you know is how to say, "I'm just a girl." Do you want to hold on to your father's apron your whole life? How can I leave just because you say so? I have to finish weaving the kishuthara. What? I have to finish it, it's my mother's kishuthara. That piece of cloth won't be of any use to anyone. Do you know what I mean? It won't make your life any better. Ap Atsara is not a child. He can live by himself. So where will you dump your two kids and your alcoholic wife? That's my problem. I am a man. I know how to solve it. I'm not like you who's got nothing to say except "I'm not strong enough." You don't have to worry about it. I'll find a way. I know my responsibilities. Why are you asking me then? Just because you asked me, do I have to go? Fuck you. It's easier to start a fistfight with a man than to discuss things with you. What's the time? I have to go home. Let's go. You may not be aware of this, but she didn't come to the school yesterday. Ap Atsara, only you can talk some sense into her. The fire and the enemy must be tamed when small. From today onwards, if she misses one more day we'll have no choice but to suspend her from the school. To be honest, most girls of her age are in class X. She is still in Class VI. Look, she's four years behind. Four years behind. Look at her half-yearly marks. Look at the Dzongkha marks. Sangay, don't you feel ashamed? Do you even think about your future? The least you can do is preserve your father's honour. He has earned himself a name as one of the best atsaras in the country. Ap Atsara, do you know she has been seen going around with Passa? I can't even pretend not to know. Everyone is talking about it. I don't know what to say. I can't imagine, at this age what is she trying to do? Look Sangay, do you have any aspirations in your life? I hope not a butcher's wife? You can leave. I want to talk to your father alone. I'm asking you as a friend. Please, talk to her in earnest. How many times should I let her go scot-free? Do you know Passa? He is the son of the infamous butcher. They come from a family of butchers. They have slaughtered hundreds of yaks. Look at Passa. He looks like a murderer. Do you know where they kill the yaks? Up below the pass, they tie them to a tree. The tree is bent double, touching the ground, I believe because it can't take the weight of the pain. How can one escape such atrocities? That's the legacy of Passa's family. But, what to do? That is his karma. Sangay, let's go home. Passa. Passa. Hey kid, call your father. Mother, there's someone at the door. Oh, I want to talk to Passa. Passa, Ap Atsara is here. Alright. What is it? Go inside. Take them inside. Go inside. Let's go there. I've come to talk. I'm sure you know it. It's not about you or me, it's about Sangay. So? So, I came to tell you to leave my daughter alone. Ap Atsara, what do you mean? Where did I take your daughter? What have I done? And I don't think anyone harmed your daughter. Are you serious? Don't play innocent. She's still in school. Besides, she is just 16. She's much younger than you. Ap Atsara, how is her age an issue? I have nothing to do with it. What have I done to your daughter? Don't talk nonsense, don't digress. You're destroying her life. How can I destroy it? Her life is not a material object. How can I destroy it? You're the one who is acting virtuous and playing naive. Are you trying to insult me? Ap Atsara, I am a proud man. I don't get involved in petty slandering. So far, I have never even made fun of a little boy. You're the one who is deceiving everyone with that facade of yours. I've no reason to ridicule you. I'm warning you. You'd better listen to me. Fuck you! Go find some weakling to warn. You can't deceive me with your artifice and your mask. I am a man. What do you see? I am what I am. Yes, I see a pathetic morsel from a family of butchers. How many yaks have your family killed? How many did your father slaughter? A thousand? How many did your grandfather slaughter? Two thousand? You piece of shit! What else do you know? How to drive a tractor? My daughter is still in school. Stay away from her. Ap Atsara, we can insult each other as much as we want. You can call me a butcher a thousand times. It does not affect me. But I know who you are. How long can you hide behind that atsara mask? Don't give me a sermon. Don't push me. Fuck, you have no idea what I can do. At least I am not like you. Your entire life, you've hidden behind that red mask and funny costume. What else do you know? How to make wooden penises? Do you want me to unmask you? Do you want me to speak out? Today, someone wants to become a real atsara. C'mon, pick up a bigger one. That won't even kill a flea. You want to hit me here? Hit me! Hit me! You fucking worthless atsara. You think people don't know who is behind the mask? But I know. Ap Atsara, I've slept with your daughter. Look here. I've fucked your daughter. If you don't feel ashamed, go ask your daughter. Hey, why do you look upset? Are you embarrassed to see me here? Anyhow, come to our usual spot later. I'll be waiting there. Why are you here? Didn't I tell you never to come to my school? Is it so important to say this? Whether it's important or not, you'd better be there. I'll be waiting for you. Never come to my school again. You'd better be there. Hey, hey, come here. He's had another epileptic fit. Take off your shoe and put it over his nose. It'll help. Why is he threatening me? How am I supposed to know? You know, he is my father. Oh, really? Is he your father? Now, I get it. Yes, yes, of course, he is your father. But who ever I am, I am. What's his problem? As if he is a saint, he should think twice before pointing his finger at me. If you come from a family of saints, then, who knows? You must be also a reincarnation of a saint too. So, if I sleep with you, will I be transformed into a saint too? Wow! What a transformation! From a butcher to a saint. Don't touch me. What do you mean by "don't touch me"? I'm your boyfriend. If I'm not entitled, then who is? Stop touching me. Fuck! Say that again and I'll throw you down this hill. You always say that I come from a family of butchers. So, your father must be a realized being. I believe atsaras are played by the realized beings. But, he remained a shell of an atsara. He has nothing inside. Did you sleep with anyone before me? It's none of your business who I sleep with. Of course not. Like father, like daughter. Don't show your butcher behavior here. I can see where you've come from. What the fuck do you mean? Is it my fault that my father was a butcher? Is it my father's fault that his father was a butcher? Is it my fault too that you have a father like him? You might as well blame me for you being born a worthless bitch. Do you also expect me to be a saint? Then, let me see how virtuous you are. Don't touch me. Fuck you! You fucking bitch! Who do you think you are? Get off me. You piece of worthless shit! You bastard, get off me! Tell your father that you slept with the butcher. Oh, you came late again? Where were you? Do you want to take a dip? I'll prepare the hot stone bath. Why did you call me? Why did you call me here? What do you want to tell me? Does the sun ever shine on this place? Or, maybe this empty sky does not have a sun. It seems you've begun to hallucinate again. Or did you lose your power of speech? With these lunatics where is this world heading? It's nothing. Nothing? I heard your father is retiring. I'm sure you'll be appointed as the next atsara. There is no tradition of girls becoming atsaras. Why don't you become one? To start with, you are a man. Is that so? Yes, I am a man, not a gutless girl like you. That's why you are inferior to us. Between you and me, there is a difference of nine lives. You'll have to take nine reincarnations to be reborn a man like me. The only thing you know is to blurt, "I am not strong enough." I'm convinced birds of feather flock together. A father like him deserves a daughter like you. The tragedy is some are stuck behind the mask and some can't see beyond the mask. Unlike you, I'm not a son of a slaughterer. And unlike your father, I don't hide behind a mask. I know I'm a butcher's son. You don't have to spell it out. As if your father is a virtuous man. Did your family come from a line of reincarnated lamas? Mine comes from a line of butchers. So, your life has meaning, mine doesn't. Yours is good, I'm bad. You deserve everything that is good in this world and I don't. The world is good because of people like you and bad because of people like me. Anyway, what does your father know? How to make a wooden phallus? Don't assume my silence is empty. Of course not as you're content to inherit a lot of wooden phalluses. That's why you're silent. One day, when the mask falls off, you'll see the real face. What do you know? You don't even know who raped you. Hope you don't have a baby hidden somewhere in your house? You may not know what happened last year before the festival at the monastery. Maybe today, the entire village will get to know who the real atsara is. Didn't you get raped by an atsara? You may not know but I know. Who wears that mask? Who has that mask? I know it. If you don't believe me go and look for the mask. Do you know who...? Who said I am not strong enough? Ap Atsara, it's been ages. Yes, indeed it's been a long time. So, how have you been? You still look good and strong. Well, I can't even do simple housework. You still look strong and healthy. You'll even live to be hundred. Oh, to live long is a burden. I thought you were returning from milking your cows but the bucket is empty. I sold all except one and she didn't return home last night. I couldn't go and find her. Oh, I see. What about your children? What's there to talk about? They must be in the city, Once they leave home you can't depend on them. I have to live my share of suffering. Well, that's the way it is. And where are you coming from so early in the morning? I spent the night at the monastery preparing for the festival. I couldn't go home. You know the festival starts the day after tomorrow. But I heard you didn't want to play atsara? You know, I've played the role of an atsara for 25 years now. So, I wanted to retire. Is something wrong? It's not that. I'm getting old and I don't have the energy to fool around. And there are a lot of other talented people around. Instead of standing here let's go home and catch up over a cup of tea. I'm afraid I'm in a hurry. Why hurry? The festival is the day after tomorrow. You've a whole day to prepare. It's not that. I've got to wake up my daughter. She'll miss school. She sleeps like a pig. I'll see you at the festival then. Ok, I'll see you the day after tomorrow. Wait a moment, Ap Atsara. I heard the government is going to build an airport in our valley. Is it true? Is it? I didn't hear anything about it. Our valley is a winter roosting ground for endangered black-necked cranes. If they build an airport, the cranes won't migrate here for the winter. So it can't be true. I heard it'd stay closed during the winters and be open in the summers. In that case I don't know what to say. See you then. Anyway, the airport will be of no use to me. I thought I would be happy to see a plane before I die.
