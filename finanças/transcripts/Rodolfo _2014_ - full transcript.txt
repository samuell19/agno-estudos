We've changed? Hardly, not significantly. The world has changed I've stayed the same: I live in constant change and I know all about you, all that can be known, all but your address, the city you live in your children, the language you fill out forms in, where you go in the morning and who you come back to in the evening, that I don't know but I can guess (I can see it all with frightening clairvoyance) We have not changed You live unchanged, a witness to changes. And you know almost all about me, all the you need to know. And those of us who didn't make it? But how can we talk at all about what they have change into? It is the world that changed by their not being around, we have stayed the same. Far from each other, obsessed with the same world. Small as we we are, insignificant. Girls, come on now, photo, photo. Hurry before they go! Wait, wait, I'll give you the photo! Wait, I give you the picture! They are too stuck-up. We are all human in the end, no? How much do I owe you? It's 5000 Lire. Damn, that's a lot. Give me a little discount. You saw what happened. 5000 lire is too much. I give you three. The price is 5000. Come my friend... what is your name? Elvis. Elvis, nice! Like Elvis Presley! No, it's nothing like that. Where I come from Elvis is a common name... like Gianni here in Italy. My name is Rodolfo. Rodolfo Valentino, the second! And so Elvis, what I can do with that picture? You, give me 5000... and you can have the picture. They are so beautiful, no? They are so beautiful, no? I think this is the most beautiful photo you have ever made. And so like that... you must pay me. Oh no, no... Wait wait wait. First, you pay me 2000 for the most beautiful photo ever... and then I pay you 5000 and you give me the photo. Like that, we are both happy! Elvis, my friend... where do you come from? Sarajevo, Yugoslavia. And why you speak such good English? I learned it in school and then I lived one year in US, as exchange student. I lived in London for 10 years. I worked in cinema... at La Scala. You know La Scala? No. It was a very beautiful cinema in London. I was projectionist. You know what is projectionist? Yes, I know what is projectionist. Very well? Yes. Very well? Yes. It was a very good job. I see all the film... I make some money... and I no work too hard. But now... all is finished. La Scala is closed now... and I have no more job. So I come back to Italy. You like Venice? It's ok. I like it here. It's very quiet. But the sea... is not so nice. No. No. In Puglia, where I come from... the sea is very beautiful. You have the sea where you come from? No, but we have mountains. Mountains! Mountains can also be nice, but I prefer the sea. Tomorrow I will go to stay... in Puglia awhile. And so, I will see beautiful sea again. I like that! I like that! See the sea. English is a strange language... so many words are the same but mean different things. Yes, listen, I really have to go now. To take some photo... lire. Yeah yeah, I understand, wait. This... here... Sorry, moment. I take the money. I give the money, one, two... No. No? I have... oh, sorry. Four. So, if you want to see beautiful sea you must come to Puglia. You have paper? I give you my address. You simply have to leave... Without me... and you know that. Cold and hunger cause casualties accross Bosnia. Nine Croatian refugees died of exhaustion in Kiseljak... close to Sarajevo Severe weather conditions prevail in Mostar... where the UN forces have been unable to aid the civilian population... often due to interference from the militias. In the Bosnian capital... three children were killed by a grenade... while playing in the snow. Two more were injured. Take two, take two! I give you... my address. And so... you can come to stay at my house. I take you to the sea. You can take... the train straight to Pascarosa. Everybody knows me there. So you just ask for Rodolfo Valentino. The second, remember, the second. You have to get off here, this is your stop. Thanks. Where are you going? What are you doing there? Move out of the way! What do you want? What are you doing here? I don't speak Italian. (speaking German) I don't understand German. (speaking German) No. Do you know Rodolfo Valentino the second? Who the hell is that? It must be that guy... with the big hat, who wears white all the time. He lives a long way away. What do you want us to do? We can't do anything. I can take him. I have to go to my uncle's anyway. Go ahead and get going. Go on. And who are you? Rodolfo Valentino Who are you? I speak little Italian. Rodolfo Valentino. My son. Get up! Get up! Thank you for coming my friend. Tonino! Tonino! Can you take us to the station? Turn that off. Can you take us to the station? Yeah, sure. Come Elvis. Who is the other guy? My American cousin. His name is Elvis. Like Elvis Presley! Remember? We go to Ceglie. The town more close to my house. It is full of people who talk too much. Too much about their lives and everybody else's lives. To live is not enough for them. They have to talk about it. But, is my town. So... like that... I have to go there. (Rodolfo shouts) (Man shouts back) Would you like to drink something? Sure. A good day to all. Vince... do you always have a beer in your hand? You take coffee? Yes please. Make him a coffee and give me an amaro. The amaro! So how is everything? Everything is fine. We keep going. So do you like him? Cute. Your cousin? A relative? A friend? He's not a friend. He's a friend who came from America to see me. Ah, really? You got something to say about it? You better not. Just a moment. Look how crazy those guys are. It's not the first time the UN headquarters in Sarajevo... was hit during the shelling. And it does not seem to be an accident. The mortars that surround the city are perfectly aimed at their usual targets... I'll give you 5000... for three. Yeah right, 5000. I'll give you two... for 6000. Or three for 8000. Damn it... give me... give me three. I said 8000... give me another 1000 lire. Go on. So did you win anything? Did you? How much left to do? Just a little. Can we get a lift? Sure. Thanks So what do we do now? We wait. Come... we go to visit l'anguilla. L'anguilla! Okay. Hey! You there? (Rodolfo shouts) What do you say, everything okay? Where you come from... they also put l'anguilla into the cistern? What's l'anguilla? L'anguilla, you know... is like a snake... but he live in the water. About so big. Oh, that's what we call jegulja. But they usually live in rivers... so... why do they put them inside? To clean the water. L'anguilla eat the little animals that fall from up. And, how many do they put inside? Just one. One? She... lives the whole life alone... in the dark. Waiting always for something that fall from up... so, that he can eat. That sounds like a terrible life. Yeah. But, many people... they also live like that. Maybe... that is why... some people from here... decide to jump into the cistern. You're saying that people actually here kill themselves by jumping into a well? Yeah. This is a well? Yes, I think that's how it's called. So... when you are not well... when you are not so well... you jump into the well. Not well... well. When the wine is fermenting... inside the cistern... the death... is very quick. Because there is no oxygen. Not a bad way to go eh? Yes, but... when the wine is not fermenting you can always go... to visit l'anguilla. You know... maybe some... they go inside the well only to keep l'anguilla company. Because... he is always alone. It is nothing. Ah, finally, Come. Do you have any petrol you can sell? I've got some back home, sure. Can we go get it now? Sure, sure, let's go now. Let's go then. Fill the whole thing up. Yeah, yeah. That's it. Come on, a bit more. I still have to put the top on. So are you giving me the 2000 lire or not? Alright, here you go. Thanks. Put the top on. Close it well and put it on the ground. Is this the time that we eat? And who the hell is that? What the hell have you been up to? Mum... bring a chair. Let's have a little wine. Let's go ahead and eat then. It's already cold now. I'm feeling tired. Go on, go lie down, you good for nothing. Good for nothing. Go lie down. Don't you want some fruit? No, mum. I'm going to go sleep. I see you later my friend. How did you meet my son? How did you meet my son? Friend. To me he seems... Yes. Have a drink with him. Keep him company. Drink. Hello. Who are you? I speak little Italian. Who are you? I don't speak. May I? Thank you. How did you get to know my son? Speak slowly. I speak little Italian. It doesn't matter. You want to help me? The stones are there. When my son was young, he was so sweet. He would always help with the farm. He would prune the vineyard and climb the trees. Then he went to school. He went into the military. Back from the military he said... "I don't want to have anything to do with farming". And then he went to London. When he came back from London he was worse than ever! He even had some problems with the police. Come! Now we go to the sea. Oh, okay. Wait me here, just moment. Ok. Ready? Yeah. That's enough work! Come on, come to the sea with us. Are you crazy? Where do you want to go? It's cold. It doesn't matter if it's cold... we can warm each other up. Come on, let's go. Go get warm with your friend over there. There are towers like this, up and down the sea, here in Puglia. They made them a very long time before. To protect the people... from... the world outside. The Turks. The pirates. From the top... every tower can see another tower... to communicate with the other towers... and defend from the enemy. But... like you can see... it is not what is outside... that is the problem. One day... we all like the towers... break from the inside. And who puts the stones back... when we break? People close to us? And if... they also... silently break apart? No my friend... no. After we break... we all stand silent like this tower... broken on one side... strong on the other. Then... we can no more communicate with the other towers. And there is no one... to put the stones back again. We are all like this. Sometimes... we break... when we are young. Sometimes it takes longer. But in the end... we all break. My friend... the sea... the sea... is our only friend. Come, we go to make some fun. Bloody hell! Bloody hell! Boody hell! It is finished! What? The petrol is finished. We push. Hey... for how long are we going to push this? We must find... somewhere safe for the Vespa. If someone... find it tonight... we will never see it again. I know a place... not so far from here. Come. Shit! Thanks. And so my friend... we walk, we talk, we live, we die... and in the end it makes no difference. We can say, bye bye! Bye bye rose. Hi ma. Come sit down. Sit down. Do you want some coffee? Coffee? Yes. Thank you. I have to get some work done. I... train... station. Where are you going? I... go back to Rome. You want us to take you to the station? Yes. Alright, we will take you. Hey man. Listen... I'm going back to Rome. Okay. One day... maybe... we meet again. Bye. One day... like the towers... we all... break from the inside. You can always go to visit l'anguilla. Some... they go inside the well... only to keep the Anguilla company... because he's... always alone. Only olive trees. All day... every day. We are all like this... broken on one side... strong on the other. Bye.
