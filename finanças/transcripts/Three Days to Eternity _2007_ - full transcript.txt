Where is it? - Yusuf. Come with me. - Okay. Stay tuned for the morning news. It fits well, right? Oh dear. Open it. The problem I talked about earlier... - Fine then. - This is better. We're all gathered here... - Auntie, that hurts. - Come. Give me a kiss first. Otherwise, there's no way... Ambar. Where have you been late at night like this? - Who's Leni? - Leni. My golf buddy. Sit over here, Yusuf. These are the items that I want you to bring via the land route with my car. Be extra careful. I simply don't trust the handling of airplanes. - Yes, Auntie. - It's the tradition in our family. On Midodareni night, the parents give a last dinner to their daughter. And we always use these plates. And I trust you will deliver these safely to Jogja. It's hers. Please give me a glass of cold water. - Even though at that time... - Ugh, it's bothersome. ...his weight was not ideal. He walked like this. But it's okay. What's important is I know that you love him. But if he doesn't love you... Anisa! Uncle wants some cold water! What is it again? Look at you! Where are you going? I won't be long. It's my friend's birthday. No, thanks. May I? Nervous? Can you believe it? You're getting married! I guess. Why did you agree to do it? I mean in Jogja. Let's not talk about it. You know how Mom is. The Merapi volcano may erupt many times, but when it comes to family tradition, no one can argue with Mom. Yes. And now our house is packed. I'm not up for all this "let's be lovey-dovey" crap. I want to call Opik. Opik? He was "Kubil" this morning. And now, all of a sudden, he's "Opik"? Honey, where are you? You haven't called me all day. I'm so bored here and the house is packed. LET'S GET WASTED. Don't be late tomorrow. What are you doing? - You know what to do tomorrow, right? - Yes, Dad. You just go to bed. Yes. You know why you were asked to do that, don't you? When someone trusts you, don't disappoint them, okay? All right, I'm off to bed. But you, don't get too tired. Damn, this place is packed. Mainstream. Miss. - Edo! - Ambar. You're so wasted. Oh my gosh, Ambar! - What do you want? - Beer. A beer? Beer, one pitcher. Gin tonic for me. Meet Yusuf. Yusuf, this is Dait. Dait, this is Yusuf. - Yusuf. - Dait. Ambar! I got it. - Is it good? - Of course. Give me your hand. Who is Yusuf? My cousin. Let's go, baby! Let's go, baby! Anisa! Yes, hold on! One minute! I'm doing the laundry! Your father said don't be late to the airport! Your mother took your luggage. Yusuf! They left me. What should I do? Yusuf! Whatever. I'm taking a shower now. ...on board. I'm sorry, sis. I woke up late. Everybody is here except you. Can you show some sense of family and come when needed? Why are you mad? I told you I'm sorry. I'll be there. But it's not my fault that you're getting married on such short notice. You know you're in the wrong. You're my only sister and I want you to be here now. Got it? Here's Dad. Yes, Dad. I'll just go by car, okay? I don't like to fly alone. I'll be with Yusuf. So I'll be safe, right? I don't want to. Why should I go there? I don't need them to boss me around. The driver doesn't have to come. Yusuf and I will be fine. Here's Yusuf. My dad. Yes, Uncle. I know, Uncle. Through the south, Cipularang. Yes, Uncle. Sorry to trouble you. - Yes. Assalamu alaikum. - I know the vocalist. My date when I was in Bandung. Miss, you want to take this too? Of course. - Bye, Anisa. - Bye, miss. Have a safe trip. I'll just be a minute, Ambar. - Edwina. - Yusofa. - Just chill here for a minute. - Okay. I'll be back. - Yusofa. - Edwina. Look at you. To fill your wallet with. Ciggy case. One bonus for you. My own creation. Pure. - Edwina. - Yusofa. Let me drive, Yusuf. Yusofa, good catch. EAST PONDOK GEDE TOLL GATE That car... could pay for three years of college fees for a whole faculty on my campus. How's college? Where are you signing up for? Or are you taking another year off? I haven't thought about it. Besides, education in this country is below standard. Why compete to be a loser? It's better than wasting your dad's money. It's not a waste. He's investing in EQ growth. - Investment? - Of course. Whatever investment parents put into their children is a long-term one. Okay. Interesting. What about your plan to go to England? Let's not talk about school. It's hurting my brain. I'm not interested. Losers are those who have never tried. By the way, do you know where to go? I don't. Do you? Nope. This is stupid. We should've brought Ali the driver with us. It's all on you. I just love watching your gigs. Yes. Yes, that's right. Yes. I will let you know, okay? Yes, of course. Yes, sure. I'm driving this time, okay? Yusuf! Let's stop by Bandung. See? Come on, Yusuf. We've never been to Bandung together. We'll stay over at my friend's place and leave first thing in the morning for Jogja. If they ask, just tell them we don't want to get lost if we drive at night. Okay? Yusuf. We have to be in Jogja tomorrow. Everybody will be mad at us. We can do that after the wedding. Yusuf. Yusuf, listen. Once we get there in Jogja, they're only going to tell us to do this and that. You want that? I don't. Come on, Yusuf. They'll be fine without us. Okay, Yusuf? We'll be only a few hours late. Okay? When else can we get this chance? This is Bandung. Yusuf. When else can we go? If I were Adin, I wouldn't have agreed to do this. Really? Why? It's just lame. She's not pregnant, she has a job, and she makes good money. At her age, being forced to get married because they caught them having sex? Insane. Where's your right to choose? There's no right to choose for them because they got caught. Besides, does she mind this marriage? She's involved in the preparations. I know her, Yusuf. Sometimes she cries before she goes to sleep. She doesn't laugh as much anymore. I think she's scared. I heard her try and discuss it with Dad. But my dad said, "If you don't get married, it means you're a whore." He was just upset. But I wouldn't be happy if he called me a whore. I don't get him. He shouldn't judge our morals like that. He thinks I didn't know he's had affair? Everybody does! Besides, my parents have been separated since I was little. Come on. Don't talk about marriage. Although, getting caught having sex. Being naked in front of your boyfriend's mother. - How awkward. - So embarrassing. But in this day and age. I mean, come on. Baby. Meet my cousin. Yusuf. - Yusuf. - Ambar's cousin is my cousin too. Come in. Here you go. - May I try? - Go ahead. You're the First Outlet guitarist, right? You're right. Ambar said you've recorded your second album. - Right. You listen to our music too? - Yes. I like it. I like the sound of Reject. Where's your studio by the way? In Studio 21. I'm kidding. In this second album, you wrote a lot of music too? Quite a lot, me and Eka. Were you in a band too? Yes. But we didn't have the money to make an album. I used an old Yamaha guitar for all of Reject's albums. But it's cool, it has that spontaneous effect. I bought this guitar, a Taylor guitar. Damn, it was so expensive. The sounds are cool though. Clean. But we don't get the spontaneous effect. Really? What do you mean? That's what I mean. This is good. This is new. What is this? Better than a Red Ferrari. So you will go to college in Bandung? I don't even know if I go to college. Are we going? Calm down. Relax. Relax, Enjoy. When you feel the No Name kicking in, then we can go. So we will look good. Did you always want to be in a band? Me? Not really. I wanted to look for a regular job so I wouldn't close myself into a small circle. As small as your toe. Try this. Elvis! Wake up. Are you hungry? We're making instant noodles. It's too slow. Really? Let's go on a trip. We'll go to the beach. Swim all day. Have fun. And then, we drink. We do lovey-dovey stuff. I'm going to Bali next week. Come with me? But we're staying in Amandari, okay? Sure. By the beach. Sure. I will make you happy. Yusuf. Let's go. I already left a message. Let's go. Sir, do you know the way to Jogja? To get to Jogja, you must take the road to Malangbong through Nagreg. - To get to where? - Jogja. That's wrong. They should take the highway. I know for sure. I have a cousin who lives in Jogja. Which cousin? You don't know the way. Don't insult me. My first husband was a bus driver. He used to take me out of town. He was a heavy drinker and a troublemaker. Astaghfirullah! Don't speak ill of the dead. He might've been drunk all the time, but he treated me with respect. Unlike you, who loves to feel my niece's ass. You old geezer! But it's your niece who came to me. Good thing I still think of you. Stop badmouthing my niece! Do you want me to hit you? Old, ungrateful man! All you have is a big mustache! Ungrateful wife! My late wife was kind and obedient. Unlike you! Fat woman! Crazy old couple. Do you still want to get married, Yusuf? Of course. A happy household is my dream. Why? You don't want to get married? Sure I want to. But later. When I have my own money. My dad says that if you worry about money, you will never marry. And how will you provide for your kids? You're acting like a bule, keeping on talking in English. Smoke weed again. Of course. - The police. Turn right. - Why? You look wasted. And I'm a little high too. There's an empty spot. - Didn't catch anything. - Bay. - We haven't got time. - Just for a short while. I don't swim, okay? Damn. It's very hot. Very nice. It's so nice. - You've been here before? - Yes. - Who did you come with? - Elvis. He's a bit weird. Eccentric, right? You know, he's an artist. I don't know. I just don't like him. Why? He might seem like a snob when you first meet him. - This is so good, like having a massage. - That's right. Bay. What if someone hears you? Let's swim to that side. No, thanks. I'm too weak to swim. - Is it cool to smoke weed here? - It's cool. - May I? - I'll hold it. Your hand's wet. - It feels relaxing, doesn't it? - Yeah. The nature in Bandung is really nice. This is Subang, West Java. I say potato, you say potato, right? Java is the most densely-populated island in the world. Really? I thought it was America. I'm talking about the distance between one person and another. America is bigger, so the distance between one person and another is further. Got it. Listen. We are the fourth most populated country in the world. And half of those people live in Java. And West Java is the most populated area of Java. - No wonder it's crowded here. - Crowded, right? LAZY LOVE - Where are we now? - I don't know. Come and throw some money. Peace be upon those who throw some money. I think it's time. One bottle of mineral water. A big bottle. - Do you sell maps? - Do we sell maps? How much? Damn you. Here we go. - I know what the problem is. - What is it? I'm the problem. No, no. Wait. Indramayu. Balongan. Got it. - Tatiana. - Patina. Okay, let's go again. You can actually pee in a place like that? Anticipation of the eruption of Mount Merapi continues. After setting up some refugee camps, and collecting food supplies now the Jogjakarta government is preparing 272 buses and trucks. They will stand by to evacuate people when the eruption begins. This doesn't include the 69 ambulance units also standing by. Many of the public transport... Let's pull over for a minute. Come on. Do you have sweet iced tea? What do you want? The same. Two iced teas. I feel dizzy. My head is spinning. Let's eat something. I'm hungry. I'll have fried rice. I will have toast with chocolate and cheese and lots of condensed milk. Or I'll just have what you have. I'm tired. My body aches. Finally! I got a signal. - Who is it? - Someone from Atma Jaya college. You look so tired. Of course. Hangover. And the sun isn't helping. Let's chill here for a while. This place is shitty but it's... How do you say it? But cool? Not really. But... This place is magic. Magical. I get what you mean. - Mystical! - Mystical! That's it! A pig? Hello, Dad? I'm still in Tegal. The road is slippery, so I have to slow down. Yes, I understand. Yes. Ambar is fine. She's in the car now. The plates? The plates are fine too. Yes, we're finding a place for the night. Please tell Auntie Endang I'm so sorry I'm running late. Tell her we got lost. I'll be there tomorrow. Prayer? Yeah, I will. Later. Yes. Assalamu alaikum. Excuse me. Where can I find a place to stay? Is this Haji Satimo's house? Kasni, make us a drink, tea for the guest. Coffee for me. We only have enough sugar for one drink, and all the stores are closed. Put it in my coffee then. Just unsweetened tea for them, it's okay. You don't mind having unsweetened tea? It's okay, really. I want to ask you a favor. What's this? That's your sarong from the old days. Don't you remember? Really? You wore that when you were circumcised. I borrowed it. Yup, the silent witness to my pain. You keep it. Take me to the bathroom. I feel all gross. I haven't had a shower. I'll wash my face with the mineral water. I'm not lying Just look at Neneng. She was not even ripe when we got married. The secret? My strength! We have two children. And now, she is pregnant with our third child! I don't mean to brag, but that's the truth. I am strong! That's amazing. Your first wife is okay with it? That's the thing. As the head of a family, don't let anyone tell you what to do. As men, we have the right. But it doesn't mean we can do things as we please. I've never mistreated Kasni, my first wife. I wouldn't be what I am without her. Especially since I always fulfill her needs physically and spiritually. By the way, have you tried sex? And your sister? She looks like she's experienced. I can tell if a woman has experience. She has sexy calves. I personally favor threesomes. If you want, we can have a foursome. Or a fivesome. Good night. Oh yes, good night. Oh my God. Morning. Ma'am, where's my car? My husband moved it to the village council. He's washing it. Is that my necklace? It fell from the vehicle when he cleaned it. So, I put it on. It's nice. I like it. Yusuf, wake up. The car's gone. And the wife took my necklace. Why did you choose this place anyway? Yusuf! Ma'am, where's Haji Satimo? He's washing your car to make it clean. He knows about cars, don't worry. He used to be a bus driver. That's my sister's necklace. Can I have it back? Let me keep it. I parked the car at the village council. I washed it. I think we better go now. Can I have my sister's necklace back? It's from our mom. Give him back the necklace! Where is my necklace? You shouldn't have gotten in our car and messed with our stuff! I only wanted to clean the car. Many students have stayed over here before and we never have problems. Where's my car now? In front of the village council. My son will take you there. Let me do the talking. Sir, I'm sorry it's ended up like this. - But we both thank you... - Miss, let me take you to your car. I hope it's enough. Excuse me, sir. They're crazy and you did nothing. It's all right. We can see the car from here. No signal! Dad called us many times. Got any 20,000s for Anto? - Anto, thank you so much. - No. I was just helping. - It's okay. Take it. - I'm just helping. It's okay. I'm really annoyed. You didn't say anything. You're not mad at them? How can I get mad? They did nothing bad to us. They did nothing? He took the car without permission, and she took my necklace. And to you that's nothing? Cut it out. You got the necklace back and the car's okay. What else do you want? It's so you. You can't tell the difference between right and wrong. All you can do is stay silent, nod your head, and act polite. Have some guts! You're a man! You know what? You can be so spoiled sometimes. Just because you can have everything you want doesn't mean you can get it anytime you want. You want everyone to be like you. Complaining at the drop of a hat. People are different, you know. Just be grateful for what you have now. What's that all about? What are you trying to say? - You know what I mean. - No! Can't you just say it? Enough. Stop talking about it. Let's eat now. Whatever! LAMB SKEWERS SWEET SOY SAUCE MEAT STEW ORANGE JUICE, COFFEE MIX Are you gonna stay silent? If you don't like what I said earlier, tell me. Don't just be quiet. It's nothing. Yusuf. Come on, talk to me. I'm tired of seeing you sulking. Who's sulking? You were very rude to them! They did us a favor by letting us stay in their house. We paid for it. It wasn't a favor! I was still polite to them because you told me to shut up! I'm sick of listening to you! You don't think I'm sick of your silence? I'll drive! I'll get us faster to Jogja! You're too slow! You're out of battery. Hi, Mom. What are you doing? We just saw an accident. CALL SHOP, OPEN No, it wasn't us. Mom. Let's talk some more when I get to Jogja, okay? I just wanted to tell you that we'll be there shortly. The plates? The plates are fine. Mom, I just wanted to say... You're busy, aren't you? All right then. We'll talk later. Okay. So, you really think I'm spoiled? Yeah. Sometimes. Ambar, what's wrong? It's not entirely my fault that I'm spoiled, is it? I never feel that I'm being spoiled. How can I regret something that was not my choice? Oh my gosh, Bay. Please don't cry. I'm sorry, okay? Bay. Hey, pretty baby. Yusuf, I'm sorry. It's okay. Sorry for what? Because I was angry at you. When I should be angry at them and at myself. I shouldn't have said what I said. I should've thought about why I was angry. And then I could have been angry. But that family... A bunch of loonies, really! Let's leave it. We're okay, right? But... do you really think I'm spoiled? Okay. I'll say no more. Can I borrow a shirt? Why should you ask? Just take it, no need to ask. I was going to, actually. But your face put me off. Spark up! If I do it, then it turns bad. Dog meat stew. You dog, meat stew! Bay! Bay! Bay! All right. Wear my hat. You look like a goat. I will keep this picture. One day, I will reach these places. Futala. Tibet. You mean this one? I want to take you to Sendangsono. What do you say? Let's go. - What kind of place is that? - Smarty-pants. It's a pilgrimage place. - Seriously? Is it creepy? - Of course not. It's surrounded by hills. It's a place of pilgrimage for Catholics, where they come to pray. - Been there before? - Nope. - You want to pray there? - No. Well, yes. But that's not the point. If you want to go to Sendangsono, that's a good enough reason. How long do we still have to walk for? - But tomorrow at 5:00 a.m., we can get in? - Yes. - Excuse me. - Yes. We're too late. But it opens at dawn. Let's stay the night? Agree. But no sleeping in a stranger's house. No need for that. We'll sleep in the car. Want to try? Half each? You're insane. Taking drugs in a place like this? Relax, it's not as strong as ecstasy. You like making your own rules, don't you? You better use your own mind instead of listening to others. Where did you read that? I forget. I know why your sister chose to get married. Because she is... She's 27. So what? You have to get married when you're 27? When you're 27, you will make a life-altering decision. Janis Joplin, Jimmy Hendrix, Morrison. Kurt Cobain. They all died at 27. President Soekarno established the Indonesian National Party at 27. Go and check. Say it's all true. But why 27? When you're 27, as I said earlier, you will make a life-altering decision. That's when then the doors in your life are either opened or closed by God. It was closed for Kurt Cobain. When you're 27, you will make an important decision that will change your life. Interesting. Are you hungry? Isn't this stealing? Of course not. I know this type of banana costs Rp 17,500 at the Supermarket near my house. We'll slip Rp 50,000 over there. Done. But... Another important age is 29. What's with 29? When you're 29, Earth and Saturn return to the same positions they were in when you were born. Saturn is the planet that controls your subconscious, so all your natural instincts will arise. It's like somebody holds you upside down, and shakes your insides out. And you're forced to see everything that comes out and you put them back in. I'll stop at 27, thank you. What about 19? We're not even a quarter of a century old. We're too young to be considered. What other age is important? At least for you personally. Thirty-five. My mother died at 35. Hey, don't listen to the music alone. I like this DJ. Down-tempo. You look like your mom. Really? Come on, tell me a story. I'm tired. Just tell me any story. Tell you a story. About what? I'm a little bit high and you want me to talk. Yusuf. You haven't had sex, right? Why? Nothing. I'm just asking. But why ask questions like that? What's wrong with the question? If your parents didn't do that, you wouldn't exist. It's weird imagining your parents doing it. But you understand what I meant. Because I think guys have to be experienced. Girls, not so much. Why is that? Curious right? Answer my question first. If I say I have? - Then you haven't! - But I just said I have! Come on. You're always afraid and polite, but want it badly. But nevertheless, you're a nice guy. What do you mean? "Afraid and polite, but want it"? You're silly. Why is it important for guys but not girls? Because sex is so important. Listen. A guy has to master it, or at least he has to know what to do. Or else, the girls will find more experienced guys. Guys can also find more experienced girls. Possible, but unlikely, because guys always want to be better. That's why they dig porn, right? What the hell are you talking about? Let me put it this way. When it comes to sex no matter how stupid a guy is, he would want to appear smarter than the girl. I don't. That's why you're still a virgin. Ambar, wake up. Hi, Mother Mary. Haven't seen you in a while. I'm not a Catholic, but I went to Tarakanita school. And my sister Adin too. If my mom doesn't know yet, I don't mean anything bad. I don't play games with religions. You're awfully quiet. Mind if I share my feelings? Sometimes I fear that I'm nothing. What do you mean? Yeah. I fear that I'm nothing and I will never be anything. You will become something, that's for sure. You're smart. That's what you think. I don't even know what I want to be. I know I still have a long way to go. But I'm scared. I understand what you mean. I'm also scared I won't get a job, even though I've only just started college. But life is a struggle anyway, right? That's true. But I also fear loneliness. I date a lot. But I have never really been in love. If you're wondering about something, and you can't figure it out even though you try, it means, at this moment when you're thinking about it, it's not the time for you to know the answer. I'm not making sense to you, huh? You are. Hey, you speak English? I learned a little from Nur Ubay. How dare you? You made fun of me when I spoke in English. And that's not a bit, that's a lot! Liar, liar pants on fire. There are a lot of things that you don't know about me. Really? Including that you're a virgin? Oh, stop it. Why do you have so many? Half ounce. But in turn, I had to do something for Edwin. FISHING SPOT Dear God. I accept the marriage and wedding to Adinda Napitupulu binti Berson Napitupulu with the dowry of a set of prayer equipment, paid in cash. - Gentlemen? We all approve? - Approved. Praise be to God. Thank you so much. How is Aji doing? - But there's some percentage... - Right. - According to the last... - It's just normal. The tickets, the dates, the airplane. You'll get scolded. Hey, excuse me. Mom. Drink this. But I have my son. Yusuf. Come here. This is Mr. Mul. Yusuf. Mr. Mul, this is my eldest son, Yusuf. He's a student at the University of Indonesia, majoring in architecture. His GPA is 3,6. Yes, sir. I will call you again. Thank you. What is it, Yusuf? I want to apologize, Auntie. It's okay, Yusuf. I'm just thankful that Adin's wedding can still take place among our family here. And we're all right. Come in. Yusuf? I have decided. I'm going to study in England. Glad to hear that. What did my mom say this afternoon? She said, "Ambar is really a sweet and sensitive girl. But she's too shy to show it to others." Sure, whatever. Yusuf, thanks, yeah? For the trip. Come on, push it. SERVICES FOR GLASSES FREE FOR EARTHQUAKE VICTIMS NINE MONTHS LATER Welcome, all of our guests, to the wedding of our friends, Herlambang and Herlina. We will share the happiness with the performance of Herlambang... - For who? - Herlina definitely. Not bad. Adin, are you pregnant yet? Don't wait too long. It'll get more difficult as time goes on. With children, if the age gap with the parents is too big, it could be difficult to communicate with them. But it's not the best. You want more? I still have some. Mama Sri! Pretty, right? - Auntie. - Hi, Yusuf. - Adin. - How are you? Just got here? Yes. Is this your girlfriend? Have you set the date yet? Don't wait too long, or you will... Auntie, I want to ask you something. When will you get married? Thank you. You're still in a relationship with Anton? Babe, what are you doing here? Come, I want you to meet someone. - Nana! - Yes, just a second. How's it going? Good. Just got back? Not really. I've been here for three days. It's spring break. Yusuf, come here. I want you to meet someone.
