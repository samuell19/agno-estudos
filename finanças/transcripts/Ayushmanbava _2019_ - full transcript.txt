He's in Seat number 12. Neither did he take the last flight nor did he leave by road. Like you said, he's heading in the train sir. Finish him! The damn bartender refused to give more alcohol! The liquor had no effect on me. If only I could've had another peg... It's midnight, yet why aren't you all asleep? We're the ones who are supposed to ask you this question, not you! But it's you guys who need to wake up for work tomorrow, not us. We have no job or errand to run. The club called to us tell that four oldies are refusing.. ...to leave the table despite it being the closing hour. Did he refer to us as oldies? - Dad! You're a doctor. It's easy to advise everyone. But make sure you stand without waltzing. Gopali! Meet my daughter! - Hello! Dear Father! Are you trying to introduce me to my father-in-law? Where's my daughter? Did she fall asleep? I'm right here, dad! And why did the three of you come here instead of heading home? Do you plan to continue boozing? Heavens no! There's not a single bottle of Whiskey, Brandy at home! Except for a bottle of Gin! - Thank God! There's no stock! Everyone complains about their kids and grand kids coming home late... And it's the opposite in our house! Come on! We're fine. We all can walk, run, jump and fly. What do you say? As you say! Go to bed now. We can discuss this in the morning. Please go! They're standing right here. There's no fun in drinking like this. Good night! - Let's go! When I came to this house, I was ten-years-old. At first, I was a cleaner. Later I became the gardener. And then, I was the watchman, until I became their milkman. I sneaked into this house and became their cook. After grandpa's time, I'll be the boss of this house. You? The boss? - Why not? Can't an employee become the boss of the house? If our younger boss hears you, your job will go out of the window! Yeah right! No boss of this house can get me out of here! Because I'm here thanks to the lady boss' influence! Got it?! Take any house, those who are employed by the man of the house, don't stay back. And the one's employed by the woman of the house will not leave the place. Mark my words! With time, I shall rise higher! Keep watching! Yeah right! Things are yet to grow down there, and he speaks of rising up! What do you mean? Get rid of these shorts and wear pants! Maybe then you can develop! Mark my words! I shall make sure you develop things first! Only then will I develop the rest! Saru, study hard for another year and be done with the course. Okay? Don't listen to your friends and skip classes. Got it? Kids aren't supposed to take phones to school. Tulasi? It's getting late. Hurry up! Bye mom! I'll be there in ten minutes. *MUFFLED CONVERSATION* GOPAL: Boys? I've fixed an appointment at the parlour. Meera? - Grandpa? We're late. Let's go! - We need to go shopping. I'm waiting for my cup of coffee. Seems like no one's concerned. What's up doc? How come you're serving coffee? Apparently nobody will take care of you today for coming home late last night. You're being punished. When I was out walking, my daughter asked me to make breakfast for you. All I know is to make omelette from a country chicken's egg. And you can attach a copy to us. - Okay. Excuse me. - Hello? Huh? What? Gosh! Next! Who are these girls? Doesn't she seem fine? Everything is fine, but she should be compatible with Gopi right? May I come in sir? - Welcome. Take your seat! Your name? - Sundari. Age? - 30! Marital status? - Married. What does your husband do? - He's a Taxi driver. Then you're rejected. - We're not looking for married women. We need a spinster or a divorcee to take care of Gopi! This picture's good. Uncle, what's happening here? From now on, there's no need for anyone.. ...to worry about your father's well being. We're looking for a partner to take care of him! What? - I mean.. A caretaker! We're looking for a female caretaker. To give your father meds on time, to massage his leg when he's tired.. To take care of his breakfast, coffee, lunch and bed at night.. Dad! - Why are you chiding us? Your father-in-law's announced in on social media.. The video's trending on the net today! My dear in-law, you don't have to justify anything to them. Please continue with the interviews. Next! - What's all this? All thanks to your idea of punishing him, he's returning us the favour! We followed your words and ended up not giving him even a cup of coffee! It's entirely your fault. Bear with it! I've been divorced from my husband for over five years! Very good. - How old are you? I'm only 35! - Very good! Is your husband paying for your living? He's paying for my living, and living with another woman! Which means your future is fixed! Shall I take the measurements? - You may now! Let me take a picture. - Congratulations young lady! Dad! Uncle! - Please stop this. Your granddaughter's getting engaged next week. Does this seem necessary now? Father, please forgive us. We'll take good care of you from now. Gopi! Don't let sentimental words melt you. Dad! Quiet! Uncle, please! *IN UNISON* Fine! Based on your assurance.. Boys? - Yes? The Interviews are cancelled. Pay them their fee and send them off. Let's get back to work. - We shall leave now. Take care. Please come along sir! - Greetings! Please come in madam! Welcome. I'm sorry if the rains troubled you. Greetings! Welcome! Seek blessings from the elders. May you be blessed! Let me do this, please! Madam, you're looking very nice! But one tiny correction. What is that? - Let your hair down. You'll look prettier. - Is it? Okay. Looks like my evil eyes will get you. Madam, don't mind my words but.. You'll look better with a round bindi instead of a vertical one. Let me take the flowers. And you are? - Groom's mother! What? You look like his sister. I can't believe it. Let me take it! What happened? It's nothing. - First, it's for the kids. The ladies get it next, and then it's the oldies' turn. Okay? Come on kids, there you go. - Thank you uncle! What a player he is! His words.. His touch.. Everything was superb! Did he play all his tricks at once? Careful! He seems like a Ram, pray he doesn't ram into you! Relax until the bride appears. - Thank you! Seems like the groom's family has got an antagonist for me! Here's some juice! Ummm.. No thanks! And for you guys? - No thank you! We're fine. Didn't you say there was some Gin in your room? There we go! - Does this seem like a club to you? If we start drinking, there'll be a war at home! Nothing can go wrong! Tell us where the bottle is and let us handle it. It's on the table in my room. But I'm not getting it. Come on! How can you refuse a happy drink at the happy hours? Damn this guy! Who's he serving the coconut cocktail to? Some coconut water for you. - Nah! Sir! This is a nice Ginny blend! - What? Give us some! There you go! What about me? You really shouldn't. You'll have to talk to the groom's family, right? This is no ordinary coconut water. He's mixed elixir in it! Is it? Let me taste some. Yeah right! Didn't you put up an act back then? Who is this scene stealer? He can't be one of us. Must be from the groom's family! Wow! You look beautiful! Thanks! Fits you perfectly! Where are you? - On the way! What do you mean? The groom's family is here! Who will read out the invitation vows? - I'm almost there. Get here soon! You smallie! There's another cocktail left. Want some? Hold it! Follow me! There you go! - Is this mine? Enjoy! - Thank you! Dear Lord! Protect me! Lord Harihareshwara! My laptop hung! Apologies! Please come! - Forgive me for being late. It's okay. Please be seated. This is an auspicious moment. Mr.Dattu! How's your health? And your diabetes? Have some Jamun seeds. It's help you! Can I proceed? - Sure. On the next Friday of Shravana month. Shukla period. On the 9th of August of 2019.. At 10 A.M. of the Abhijin hour, in the presence of elders.. It is decided that the marriage will be conducted. This is a perfect cocktail! You must be the only moron to get drunk from water! This is psychology! This is bliss! We want you all to visit us before the marriage and experience our hospitality. That way you'll get to meet our entire family. Sure. Make sure you bring that guy along! Which guy? That guy who was actively doing all the work. He came holding an umbrella with all of you. Not really. He got the umbrella from your house. He's not one of us. Who is he? Go check if he's inside. We shall take your leave! If he's not from either of our side.. Who could he be? - Look upstairs! Find him! - I'll check the other side! What is everyone looking for? My boss is apparently missing. - What?! Forgive me sir! I'm right here. I found out.. that you're looking for someone.. ...to take care of master, in a video online. I realised that you were looking for a woman. But still, I'm here to take a chance. Instead of telling what I can do, I thought of letting you see for yourself! If you liked what you saw, you may employ me. And if we didn't? Will you leave? We don't need him! Send him away! Stay quiet! Where will we find a better worker than you in all of Karnataka? From now on.. You will work. Specially, for me! Thank you! Look here and talk! So, they took you in, huh? - Yep! I'm completely sober thanks to you! With you around, I wonder what my fate holds for me! Dear Comrade! You're the first one to pass out after drinking water! God bless you! Krishna.. - Master? The reason I asked you to stay in my room, is because.. If you stay out there, everyone will assign you work. That would be troublesome for both of us. From now on, you will eat, bathe and sleep here. This will be your bed. There's the medicine box. Bring it over. I need to take the red tablet once in the day and twice at night. And I need to take the blue tablet twice in the noon and once at night. Oh! Trika! This one reduces anxiety and lets you sleep well. And Losaro, controls your blood pressure. Do you know a lot about medicine? I worked for two years at a pharmacy. Therefore, I know a bit about medicines. That's wonderful. I don't need a doctor anymore. Daddy! I'm scared. Don't be. Get some sleep! You're from RK studios, right? - Yes madam. Do you have my engagement video? - There. Give it to me! Everyone! My engagement video's here! I changed my hairstyle for the first time in the.. ...engagement. I want to see how I look. You seem more worried about your looks than of your daughter and the son-in-law's. They need to change themselves to look good, but I look good no matter what. Hey Gopi! Doctor! Police and the Lawyer! How did you make it at the right time? My granddaughter told me that the engagement video.. ...will arrive at 10 A.M. and asked us to be here. So only we came over. - That's good. Set the Home theater up. - Sure sir. Why do they all seem so unaffected about the happenings in their backyard? Careful kids! Krishna! Join us. Greetings! Welcome! Grandpa looks like a star! Woah! This is no ordinary coconut water. He's mixed elixir in it! Uncle! Why do you have that crook like face while drinking coconut water? Why do you all have such different reactions? Sit down! Those who're behind can't see. - Will you sit down? Damn our fate! He's got a shot of the pickle too! Coconut water and pickle? Heh?! I've never seen this combo before. Which means the coconut water.. Was mixed with something. I'll reveal the coconut cocktail secret. Look what he's done. - Your pickle fetish has got us caught now! Was it necessary? - Keep quiet! Brother! I've something to tell. - Get lost! It was Krishna who mixed coconut water in the pickle! Trust me! Boss, please listen to me. It was Krishna who mixed the Gin in the pickle! Trust me. It was him who mixed pickle in the coconut water! Trust me. Why is the pickle bothering me so much? What am I trying to say? It was him, who mixed Gin in the coconut water.. On the next Friday of Shravana month. Shukla period. On the 9th of August of 2019.. At 10 A.M. of the Abhijin hour, in the presence of elders.. It is decided that the marriage will be conducted. Lakshmi! Oh God! Devaki! Vasudeva! What a disaster my life has become! Stop it! Turn it off! Who put this video along with the previous one?! Do you wish to show my Lakshmi and burn me alive? The video must have been in the pen drive. I didn't think it would play automatically. I'm sorry. Everyone walked in celebrating, and now they're walking out mourning. God, why this grief in a happy home like this? Gopi. Get some rest. We'll come back tomorrow. Master. What happened? Who is she? Don't ask me anything, Krishna. You're nowhere connected to it. Maybe.. But who did we see on the screen? What's happening in the outhouse? You're talking as if you know it all. I'm asking you because I don't. From now on, don't ever go to the outhouse. Don't ask me anything. Okay Master. I'll get you something to eat. I don't want anything Krishna. Leave me alone. Sorry dad! But why? I was the one who gave the pen drive. Oh God! Let it be. It wasn't intentional. You're not at fault. Go have your lunch. I don't want anything. - Listen to me dear. Sridevi. Take her. Both of you eat something. Dad, I don't want anything. A star floated down the sky, asking me what my secret was! ‘Wherever you go, people adore you. Tell me why’ the star went on to ask. A star floated down the sky, asking me what my secret was! ‘Wherever you go, people adore you. Tell me why’ the star went on to ask. For there’s magic right in me, Everyone adores me a lot. For there’s music in laughter, And everyone pays heed to it. This hour shall never return.. And this moment is solely yours. All the happiness you seek, is out there for you. Life is an expansive ocean.. Loss is a tiny drop in it. The more you grab, the more victorious you are. Spread Friendship! Spread Love! Spread all the experience you gain.

For this is the nature of extraordinary humans! For there’s magic right in me, Everyone adores me a lot. For there’s music in laughter, And everyone pays heed to it. Four years ago, Lakshmi sat right here and sang this song for us. And today, you sang the same song and took us back in time. But how did you sing that exact song? Last night, I heard something from the kitchen. I went in to check. A cat came out from the showroom next to the kitchen. When I checked the showroom; I found the.. ...piano, notes and the song among other things. And when the same song as the notes from the room,.. ...appeared in the video, I sang it for all of you. I thought all of you would get angry and stop me from singing. But all of you got so lost in the song, as if.. ...she was right among you and all of you ate together. Are you that well versed with music to just take.. ...a look at Lakshmi's notes and sing the song? I worked at a church before I came here. The Father of the church would play the piano. He saw that I was interested in music, and taught me the piano. After he passed away, I left the job. Master, you remind me of the Father. And I want you to be with me until my last breathe. Damn the Grandpa made a commitment. Only after my death, may you leave this house. Take your words back! You think we'll let you go so soon? We'll make sure you live longer! This woman just can't take her eyes off him! Let's go. Look. Don't touch the piano again. Don't remind us of her. Put it where you found it. - Sure sir. Master? Without knowing about her, I managed to sing her song. At least now, will you.. The one in the outhouse, is my granddaughter. I had three sons and a daughter, Devaki. Her husband was Vasudeva! Lakshmi was their daughter. My daughter and son-in-law passed away in a fire accident. Having witnessed it in real, the trauma destroyed.. ...my grand daughter and she's lost her mind. Don't ever ask me anything that would remind me of them! Mom! Pick the damn call! Chetan! You told me that you'll be back in two days. It's been a week. Where are you? Your father's scolding me here. Come back soon. Mom, didn't I tell you about my friend's wedding? When one visits Goa, the trip is bound to get extended. I've come to Bengaluru on a small job. And I’ll be back soon, okay? Okay. Take care. Mom! You! Get out if you're going to be on your phone! That is how it works here! - And if I talk in here? I don't like it when someone disturbs me with noise. So you don't like the noise, huh? - I don't! Guru! Let him go. Does this noise work for you? They're drunk. Let go! - How dare you hit me! I'll teach you a lesson when you come to Mysuru! What's wrong with you? Why do you sleep next to me? On top of that you put your arms and legs on me! The thing is.. I have a disease that makes me walk in my sleep at night. If you have a disease, find another spot, why sleep next to me and bother me? I slept thinking of you. We work together all day and night. Yet we sleep separately. So only, my heart got me to sleep next to you. Shall I? Krishna? - Sit down! Why the hell are you calling out Krishna in your sleep? Since I was also thinking of Krishna all day.. I shall go wherever he is, tightly hug him and sleep. I have the same sleep walking disease! Since when did you get this disease? Ever since you came and slept next to me, I got infected. This isn't a contagious disease. What happened sis? My laptop hung. I asked sister for help and she just walked away. Is it a Mac book Pro? Do you know about Apple computers? - Type in the password. Give it to me. I was trying since so long. And you resolved it in a minute. That was great. - Thank you! Yesterday, uncle and I played video games. He won all of them. Come on! - Sister, he's right. Uncle's a hero! If he's a hero, what am I? You..? You're a villain! Run! Sir, who are you? - Who am I? Who am I? WHO AM I? Why are you shouting? How dare you come to my house and ask me who I am? Who the hell are you? Look, please behave yourself - Why do I care? Who are you? - Chetu! You just entered the house and are already creating a ruckus! Who is he to ask about me? He's the new guy who'll take care of Grandpa. Few days at work, and he's already a hero to all of you, is it? You've been out since a week. You'd no time for the event at home. All you care is about your friends, pub and drinking. How dare you come down and create a ruckus? You useless brute! - Dad! Don't scold me in front of strangers. If only you had even an iota of goodness like.. ...he does, you would be a better person in life. So that is why all you refer to him as a hero! Is he an expert at taking care of you? Shut your mouth! - Let it be master. It's not fair to compare one another. It'll only manifest their anger on us. There you go! The psychiatrist has spoken! Hello? Please come. What does he want from me? Fine! Damn this thing's blocking me! Tell me what the matter is. Heard that you sleep walk? Excuse me. Talk to me. Since when do you sleep walk? Not like I was born with it. Ever since I came to this house, I walk a bit in my sleep. And ever since the brat in this house hit me on my head.. ...it has gotten frequent. But I'm glad I do. Move over. Let me tell you why. What is it? - Close your eyes. How many fingers am I holding? - Two. And now? - One. Open your eyes. How can anyone answer with their eyes closed? What a childish game! So you can't see with your eyes closed? - Nope! Then how do you sleep? - What sort of a question is that? You close your eyes and go... You can close your eyes and walk to the.. ...right place next to the right person. Yet you can't close your eyes and guess the number? Which means you don't really sleep walk. Remember that everyone should respect women. Just because they work with you, you think you can take them for granted? Careful! Wait a minute. What are you doing here? Leave. Your job is to take care of Master. Hand me the tiffin box. Let me give it today. If they get to know that you're here, you're doomed. Don't worry. Everyone's asleep. Give me the tiffin box. Please? Get a good look at this. I can bear this because I've been carrying her on my shoulders since she was six. Can you bear it? And not just you, once Master was adamant about giving the food. Let me do it. - Master, please don't. He went in despite my warnings. Master, listen to me! Please? LAKSHMI: Who the hell are you?! - Lakshmi, listen to me. Don't do this. LAKSHMI: Get out! GOPAL: Stop it! Listen.. Lakshmi! Dad?! - Uncle! What did you do to yourself, dad? Why are you here? Don't we all love Lakshmi? - Not that we're heartless. We had to keep her here because she was reacting the same way at home, right? I wonder how much longer we've to bear with God's punishment. She takes over half an hour to eat a morsel. It takes almost three hours to feed her meal. Will you be able to do it? Please leave. Oh my God! - Huh? Krishna! Open the door! - Don't worry. I'll be fine. Don't open the window from the inside. If sound still interests you.. ...the rhythm in your body seems to be intact. Takita Takita.. This rhythm is melodious! Peeking through the window in search of you, came the moon. Admiring your beauty, he couldn't help be wowed. He descended from the sky just for you. Takita Takita! A fortunate moment has brought this divine bond together. My Dear.. May you be engulfed in eternal happiness. May strings of happiness be yours.. Keep stretching the bow of laughter on your lips. For once, pay heed to my request.. Go and live a life of comfort! Listening to the rhythm, the clouds slowly melted to rain down. This is one such cheerful story. This ballad I now sing, is a serene journey. Filled with rhythm and tempo, there's also a background score with it. Why this loneliness, when your life can be musical? Highs and lows are common hurdles. Takita Takita.. This rhythm is melodious! Peeking through the window in search of you, came the moon. Admiring your beauty, he couldn't help be wowed. He descended from the sky just for you. What? You managed to feed her in three minutes. But how? So you went to the outhouse and fed Lakshmi, huh? I'll get you into trouble now. Master.. Any girl will get startled at the sound of thunder. But she pays attention to it. She looks for rhythm in the rattling windows. I used these sounds, sang to her while feeding her. Music continues to live in her heart. Being a music research student.. Her aim was to build a music school and.. ...she always dreamt of teaching music to poor children. When she was heading to New Delhi to take part in a.. ...National Level Music competition, the accident occurred. She forgot her dreams, forgot herself.. ...and forgot us all. Even after consulting doctors at all the big hospitals, it was of no use. We got her admitted in a mental health hospital. When we visited her a few days later,.. ...Lakshmi's hands and legs were in shackles. Why have you chained our child? Is this why you asked us not visit her? Sir, don't mistake us. Two of our female wardens who tried controlling her.. ...have suffered ligament tears in their hands and legs. We'll rather take her home instead of seeing her suffer like this. Discharge her immediately! Unable to see her in that condition, we got her home. Master, don't mind me asking. All of you love her so much, then why the outhouse? It was a treat to watch Lakshmi mesmerized while singing and praying to God. After she came home, one day she saw the fire from the Pooja room and lost it. She kicked the lamp, and created a ruckus almost putting everything on fire. Bhyraa get some water immediately! Realizing that having her inside the house could.. ...be dangerous to her, we moved her to the outhouse. On that day, I locked the God's room. I vowed that if God does exist, and if he's indeed powerful,.. I waited for him to cure Lakshmi and reopen the door by himself. Master, she will surely open the doors of the Pooja room and sing prayers to him. You will witness it. The very music that echoes in her heart.. Will cure her to normalcy. This is for him and this.. is for me! You think he can mess around with his senior? And you.. He thinks he's a big singer, doesn't he? If he drinks this, his throat will be gone, forever. Boss? Big Boss?! I'm right here. - Boss! Boss, I looked for you all over the place! My name's Krishna. No need to address me as boss! Nah! That won't do boss! You are my boss! As you wish. What's this? - I've made Badam milk for you. Your dose of stamina! Drink this and all your organs will work just fine! Is that so? Which one's mine? This one's yours and this is mine. Why can't I drink this? What? No! - They both are Badam drink anyways. If you exchange them, they're of the same colour. Both are Badam drinks and are the same doses of stamina, right? What has he done? - Fine! Take yours. Okay? Drink it! - Wait. Here.. By the way, did you brush your teeth? No matter what doesn't get brushed in my body.. ...my teeth surely get brushed four times a day. Any doubts? Smell it yourself! Shall I leave then? Everybody hurry up! We need to head to the groom's house for lunch! Meera! Quick, we're already late. - Coming. You think you can get away by complaining about.. ...Krishna going to the outhouse in sign language? We're already late and you can't even speak up? It's late and no one's ready yet! What are you saying? I'll fire you from your job. Idiot! There are kids in this house and what are you trying to show? Quit messing with me! Whatever you wish to tell, won't happen. You weren't here for the engagement. I'm waiting right here by your car so that you don't miss out on the lunch. You think I'll miss this occasion? What is it? What are you blabbering?! Where is he off to? Wherever we're going. The groom's family has invited us. What work does he have there? I don't want him to come. And if you still insist.. If I still insist? - I won't come. Master, I don't want you to miss out on this because of me. All of you go ahead, I'll stay back. If that's the case, you guys go ahead. I'll stay back. Master.. Listen to me. Let's go. Let Grandpa stay back if he has chosen his side. Master! Why did you refuse to go? Aren't you the head of the family? Your in-laws will be waiting for you. Who told you that I'm not going? Are you going then? - WE are going! But how? This is my granddaughter's car. The car seems to be working fine, what will happen to her? I'm already making it work. Not everybody gets to visit their husband's house before the wedding. You're lucky. Do you like this noise? He's my brother Chetan. - This is my son. Greetings! Looks like he's here. After all, who is he? My father! Krishna, join me inside. Master, you insisted, so I'm here. I don't want to come inside and hurt anyone. You please go. Greetings! - Greetings! We were upset that you didn't join us. But we're happy now. Hello? Why can't you pick my calls? Remember the guy who beat you up at the bar? He's in our area now. I saw him with my own eyes. He's here with his family. Time to teach him a lesson. Get the boys along! I shall wait here! Krishna! Come here. Here. Have it. - I'm fine Master. There's a buffet waiting outside. I didn't get you. Looks like our hero messed up with someone. I'll look into it. You don't worry. You relax while I take care of it. Where is he? - He's inside. Who is this guy? One.. Two.. Three.. So there are nine of you. Looks like you've ganged up to beat our hero?! This is an internal matter. Do as you please when he's alone. But I won't let you touch him in front of his family. What will you do about it? - Oh, there’s a lot to do. What did you say? - Hold it! Let's toss the coin. There you go! Oh! I'll be back. Looks like he's an expert at this too! Did you get into trouble with someone off late? Not really! There's a gang waiting outside for you. You can go upstairs and take a look. I remember that guy who was actively doing all the work on that day. You seem to have missed out on bringing him along. That day, he took care of everything inside the house. Today he's handling everything outside the house. You asked him not to come. And if he hadn't, you would've had it today. Phew! Lord help us! By the time you take these women out and bring them back home.. We would be done with four official meetings. My ears are still buzzing with all their chatter in the car. All men who make such statements, should be reborn as a woman in their next life. Only then will they realise the trouble we face. Bang on! I'll have a cup of coffee. Okay sister. What is it? Him and his sign language! My voice is back! My throat is fine! All those beatings from these men had no effect. One whack from the lady, and my voice is back. Now I understand how men suffer in the hands of women. Grandpa? - Huh? This one's for you. I chose it myself. Father? Why do you seem upset? If Lakshmi was fine, she would have gotten married first, right? Master.. You're fretting about her all over again. Six months from now, she'll get married too. You'll bless her with your own hands. Who will even marry her? The one who understands her, will marry her. If your words come true, I'll give you a big reward. Yes! I'll leave this house only after I earn that reward. Keep watching! She'll get married for sure. Krishna? - Tell me madam. Take this. It's for you. Have you bought clothes for me? - Aren't you one among us now? Madam, can I ask you something if you promise not get offended? You bought clothes for everyone to wear at Sridevi's marriage. What about clothes for Lakshmi? Clothes for Lakshmi? I don't know what to tell you. Krishna? - Master.. Look at these clothes. They all belong to Lakshmi. She's not used even half of it. My son-in-law Vasudeva.. Started a conglomerate called 'Vasudeva Group of Companies' Business worth billions.. Being born an orphan.. He wished to marry someone with a large family. And married my daughter, Devaki. After marrying her, he made all my sons quit their previous jobs.. He took them in his company and made them as the Directors. Today, my sons are running the very massive business he started. The 2,500 sovereign worth of gold he bought for Lakshmi,.. ...continues to corrode in the bank lockers. If he was alive today, he would've taken lead and conducted the marriage. And here you are asking us to buy clothes to a billionaire's daughter. Master I didn't mean in that way. One might have a lot of clothes or jewellery.. But the clothes we buy for an occasion is a special memory, right? Yes.. I agree. But will she even understand why we're buying her clothes? Will she wear them and be at the wedding? I'll bring her along, Master. Didn't we see a change in her when I was feeding her? This too will change. When you're with your family at a wedding.. She will definitely respond positively. Trust me Master. Give me one chance. I will get her along with for sure. Bring her Krishna. I know the trouble I go through while I bathe her once a week. You don't worry. Combing her hair isn't as easy as feeding her. Watch me do it. Hey Lakshmi! Good Morning. Look how scared she is of approaching you. Do you like her or not? I do. - Who is she? Mother! Then who am I? I don't.. Who are you? A friend. Friend. - Yes! Okay. And now.. Don't worry friend! I won't be combing your hair. Not yours at all.. Do you see Lakshmi in the mirror? I'll comb her hair. I'll comb that Lakshmi's hairs. Not the one in front of the mirror. Is that okay? You see the Lakshmi in the mirror? - Yeah. Will it look good on her if I part her hair in the middle? Or..? Will it look good if I lift the hair and tie it behind.. ...,without parting hair in the middle ? This is good. - As you wish! Some mascara for Lakshmi.. A coloured bindi for Lakshmi's forehead... Woah! Look at how good this Lakshmi looks.. ...when the Lakshmi in the mirror puts on some flowers? Is that Lakshmi? Be seated. Can't believe I ignored this beauty all this while! No! Don't! No! Don't! Get that mad girl out! Bhyraa, bring her back. Who brought this mad girl to the wedding? Lakshmi! You'll be fine. Let's go. Who brought this mad girl to the wedding? Speak up! Somebody call up a mental hospital. Ask them to take her away. Lakshmi! Let's leave! Speak up! Who got the mad girl here? I was the one who got here here. She.. is my granddaughter. Dad.. You never told us that there's a mad girl in your house! When we came to your house, you introduced everyone to us. Why did you hide this mad girl from us? Mr.Taptu. Don't mistake us. We did this only because we didn't want to express our.. ...grief to you when an auspicious event was going on in the house. We didn't intend to hide it from you. Fine. I get that. But then we did meet again. Your family came home for lunch. You could've told us then, right? Is it right to have hidden the truth and arrange the marriage? Sir.. I'm not their relative, but I still have something to say. Forgive me for that. Mental imbalance isn't a birth defect It is caused by trauma. Instead of asking how all of their family.. ...managed to smile with all this pain hidden.. Is it right to ask why they hid it from you? A person suffering physical deficiency isn't necessarily unwell. But the one who suffers from mental deficiency is unwell. If you can't be compassionate, it's fine. But don't throw stones at their nest. Mr.Taptu, try to understand. Your grandson won't live in our house. But instead, our child will move to your house and bring in prosperity. Nobody has to be worried. The mad girl you just saw, is my aunt's daughter. The girl I'm going to marry. If her presence in our house bothers you so much.. I'll marry her tomorrow and move away with her. Please ask your son to tie the Mangalsutra to my sister. Sir, I bow down to the unity of your family. When a new guy is talking like he's one of your family member.. It was wrong of me to have spoken like that. I apologise. That's fine. My son will not enter your house as an outsider.. ...but as one of your family members. Please continue with the rituals. Greetings! Welcome! - Greetings madam. May all of you be blessed. Master special wishes and prayers for you. We've forgotten all of it, and have become dependent on this. You.. Come closer! Whose horoscope am I supposed to look at? Lakshmi's horoscope. Lakshmi's horoscope?! Don't worry. We wish to get her married. Well.. The horoscope.. Let that be. Who's the groom? It's our Chetan! Chetan?! Are you planning to own all the wealth? Are you hatching a plan to marry her for all her property? Shut your mouth and do your job! If you screw around with the horoscope, I'll mess with your future. Are you threatening me? Watch what I do moron! Hand me the horoscope! - Here. Whose is this? - This is Lakshmi's Oh, is it? Wow. This is extraordinary. Her future seems bright. You can get her married whenever you wish. She'll have a happy married life. Master, there's nothing to worry. Go ahead and get her married. It'll be a happy ending. Please do select an auspicious date for the wedding. Am I not supposed to check the guy's horoscope too? I'm supposed to check this idiot's stars and planetary movements. I'm an honoured astrologer of Master's family. Why are you groping my shoulders? Take it off? Fine. Have fun. Give it to me. This is Chetan's horoscope. Oh, is it? His horoscope itself is crumpled. The planets, moons and meteors are all in the wrong positions. You moron. What are you doing? Why are you pointing a knife at my posterior? I'll stab you right here if you mess around. Fine! I'll do as you say. Saturn has calmed down in the ninth house of his horoscope. It's a perfect match. You may get them married any day. Please go ahead and fix an auspicious day for the wedding. This entire week is auspicious. Be it day or night.. ...you can get them married at any time. Madam, here's her horoscope. And you boy, catch your horoscope. To hell with my horoscope and fate. Master, I shall take your leave now. Let me get out before he leaves a scar in my bum. Father, tell us when shall we get them engaged. Both of them are our children, what's the need for a separate engagement? This Friday, let's get them engaged at 7 A.M.. ...and go ahead with the marriage at 9 A.M. Great. - Let's go. Master? - Tell me, Krishna. Don't mistake me. It's not good to get her married until she completely recovers. What? You want her to recover? - Yes. If Lakshmi gets married in this condition, she'll remain the same all her life. Whether she recovers after the wedding or not.. Who the hell are you to postpone this wedding? Look Krishna. This is our family's decision. Please don't interfere. It doesn't matter whether I belong to this house or not. I'm confident that she'll completely recover in six months.. Get her married then. Who do you think you are to cure her? You were a scum who roamed around begging for your life.. With nowhere to go, you managed to plant yourself here. You're only Grandpa's caretaker, how dare you interfere in our familial matters? Who are you to cure her? Do you think you're a big psychiatrist? Chetan! Don't you dare hit him! What else do you expect me to do? Should I postpone my wedding just because he says so? How can you take his side and expect me to obey? Look Krishna! This marriage is a certainty. Nobody can stop this. My grandson will marry my granddaughter. Stop interfering in this matter from now. Everybody leave. Start preparing for the wedding. Master.. I have no intentions of stopping this marriage. My only wish is for her to recover. In a few days from now.. - Krishna? If you really meant everything you spoke.. ...about our family at Sridevi's wedding. You may enter this room. Or else.. Do as you please. Everything's happening as per your wishes, Krishna. You told me that someone who understands Lakshmi well, will marry her. In her present condition, who other than Chetan will marry her? Whatever happens.. Happens for the good. Hasn't Krishna showered yet? Sir? Have you seen Krishna around? Your coffee's lying here since morning, Krishna never came to pick it up. We want only two sarees each.. - Why two of them? I'm the groom's mother and the bride's aunt, right? What happened, Dad? - Krishna.. ...left this house. Did Krishna leave the house?! Master! Lakshmi's not in the outhouse. What? - I looked everywhere.. She's nowhere to be seen. If we post this online.. When we visited the groom's house, you refused to come and took his side. And now? He's eloped with Lakshmi! I constantly warned them not to employ him from the day he came along. Did anyone listen to me back then? Go on! Suffer now! We are worried ourselves, bugger off now! There's no point in worrying. I've submitted the complete details about the car he took away, to the Commissioner. He can't get out of the four southern states. The police department will find him no matter where he is. I doubt that! - You! When water can plummet down.. When a bird can fly away.. When the sky can burn from the boiling sun.. Why do you fear anything? Everyday, at dusk, the sun sets down. With a smile he rises back, the next day. Though the moon and stars melt away,.. ...they rise above the horizon at dusk, to shine bright again. It is natural for the heart to feel gloomy, and for the memories to haunt. To head towards the light, And witness the world shine. To face one's fear and emerge victorious is the ultimate bliss. Keep marching without stumbling upon the hurdles. Surging forward, the waves flow all day.. ..and yet they progress, despite a fall. Come Rain, Come Shine. Mother Earth never bows down to defeat. Put up against the mountains, the clouds will continue to graze past it. To move past life's distressing times and fate's traps,.. ...and to march against fear is the ultimate bliss! Let go of fear, why be afraid anymore? When water can plummet down.. When a bird can fly away.. When the sky can burn in the boiling sun. Why do you fear anything? I'm here! Come win over! Emerge victorious! Come win over yourself! No matter what happens to you! Even if the sky falls upon you! Enlighten your trembling heart to stay strong! We have his visuals in this video. I'll get it circulated on social media and get him here within 24 hours. This camera might have caught his image. He'll be seen now. His face is not visible. Look at him covering his face with the flowers. All we can see are his eyes. He's covering his face with the coconuts. Looks like he's planned it well. What a crook! - Forward it. He's not shown his face anywhere. It all seems Pre-planned. He clearly walked in with a plan.. He didn't come to take care of father, he clearly intended to kidnap Lakshmi. What a great actor he must be! A brilliant actor indeed. There's no way will we be able to catch him. Looks like your granddaughter is now his.. Grandpa!! All of you might be feeling cheated by him.. But I'm sensing something else.. Gopi! I'm sure he'll get Lakshmi back Grandpa! Damn it! I doubt that. Krishna! You've eloped with a girl. What's wrong with you? My consciousness was killing me. So I had to. What do you mean? I'm the reason behind her broken life. Did you know her from before? Don't ask me anything about that. I have to get her to a music college and treat her with the help of music. That is my aim! You're not the one to take irrational decisions. I'll pray to God that you cure her and get her back home. I beg you! I'll fall to your feet! Let go of him! Chetan! Stop it! Why are you beating him? Who was responsible for Lakshmi's care? Wasn't it his job? If he hadn't let Krishna inside.. ...the outhouse, would he have eloped with Lakshmi? I'm responsible for Krishna to get close to Lakshmi. If you feel like hitting me, go on! Take it! I'm beating him because I can't do that to you! Chetan! How dare you talk to him like that? For what he's done, don't you feel like scolding him? Every one of you is unable to point out his stupidity and are keeping quiet! Despite so many helpers in this house, did he need another caretaker? Stop it! Stop scolding Grandpa! He'll definitely get Lakshmi! I doubt. Father! Friend! I'm famished! Buy me food! - What? That's good! If you're asking for food on you're own, I sense improvement. Welcome sir! - What do you have? There's banana, buns and other fruits. - I'll take a pack of this. Sure sir! Woah! Why are you rushing? Are you happy? Good then! How much is it? - Thirty.. Forty. It's a Hundred and thirty in total. Wait for me! - There's a forest ahead. Make sure she steers clear of it. Okay! I will. Wait up Lakshmi! Stop right there Lakshmi! Why did Gopi do this? I don't understand. What happened? - I don't know anything. He slept here last night. You scared the daylight out of us! What are you doing here? Please come home! The kids are requesting you so much! I can't. I have no face left to show them! I've no answers to my Grandson's questions. He blurted something in anger. No dear! He was right. I'm the one who's responsible for this mishap! I trusted him completely. Only to get hoodwinked by him! - Dad! How long will you stay here? Until Lakshmi is found! Which means you'll be buried here. Father! - Uncle! Sir! Check out that car! Head backwards. We got a photo of a similar car from the Commissioner's office, right? Yes sir! It's the same car! Check my phone. Who came here in this car? A guy had come along with a girl. A girl? And was she..? She seemed a bit different. Seemed different? Where did they go? They went towards the forest. How long has it been? - It’s been almost two hours. I've got information that he's taken Lakshmi into the forest. Why did he take her into the forest? To tell you that he's kidnapped your granddaughter.. ...and demand a ransom of One Crore rupees! Can you keep quiet? Police officials, forest officers have formed.. ...a team and are searching across the forest. What if he gets away from the forest before they get to him? There's no chance. Because Chetan has shared Lakshmi's pictures on social media. Her pictures are being shared across the social media. There's no way or chance for him to get away! I doubt that! Friend! Where are we? Who knows? I came behind you. But now I'm unable to find the way back. I'm unsure which way it is. Let's go. Oh my God! Where do I go now? Nature is the right medicine for her. Sir, could anyone from your team have brought this in here? Sorry sir! None of our officials eat inside a forest. That means.. He must have got this from the tea shop. So.. They must be close by. Sir, this isn't a safe place. Tigers, Lions and Leopards are found here. There's a viewpoint on a hill close by. We can view the entire forest from there and easily catch them. Let's go! No matter where they hide in the forest,.. ...they can't get away from this camera. Friend? - Tell me. Whose house is this? This house has been made by God for the Lions, Bears and Tigers. Do they all stay together? But how? Just like how your Grandpa has managed to hold everyone together. Grandpa? Who? - Yeah. Who's that? Your uncles, aunts and their children. Your entire family. And your grandfather. Don't you recall? I have no idea what you're talking about.. Lakshmi! Where did she go? Friend! Let's go! Wait.. The cops are here! Sir, I see two people running! Get closer to them! Go! Sir..! The trees are blocking our view. There's a thick forest ahead. They have to get out from there. Keep following them. There's a river ahead. I don't know where to look for them now! Why are you heading back? Send it forward. They have to get out of there. I don't see anyone. Sir, a tiger's been hurt. Damn it! If he's managed to kill a tiger, he must be a genius! Sir, he must be hiding in the forest. Our surveillance cameras will catch hold of him and.. ...we'll inform you as soon as we get hold of them. You please leave. Somebody inform the ambulance. Disgusting. Can't believe the department hired you! Help?! Help? Hello! Somebody help! - Baabanna! She must have swallowed a lot of water. Please help her. Who are you? - I'll tell you. Help her first. Okay. Hold her straight! Hello sir! The money you asked for. Your laptop, clothes and surveillance cameras are here. There are also new clothes you asked for her. On our way here, the cops checked our car for a mentally ill woman. It's not easy to get away on road. It's risky. Please be careful. Hello? - This is Krishna here. Is that really you? How's Master doing now? Chetan scolded Master recklessly. Also he hit me. A huge commotion took place in the house. Unable to bear the brunt, he's staying at the outhouse. If you don't bring Lakshmi back, I fear that it will affect his health. Where are you now? Hello Krishna?! Is he the good guy? Or the bad guy? I just don't get it. Name: Lakshmi. Age: 25! Mentally ill patient. If found, please contact the numbers provided below. Move aside! Hello? Take hold of this! Lakshmi! Get up! Friend! I fell down. - You'll be fine Lakshmi. Sorry! When the cops came by, why did you turn the boat around and make her fall? Don't mistake me. Someone in her family doesn't want her to get cured. They're trying to make sure she remains mentally unsound. Therefore they've put up her picture on.. ...social media and have complained to the cops. Did he elope with Lakshmi? I knew it! When I was examining Lakshmi's horoscope, I noticed him. I knew he was up to something. And he showed his true face is it? Why didn't you tell us? - Chetan! What are you doing? It's okay. He's a kid. He didn't realise. Astrologers are equal to Gods. One shouldn't disrespect them. Forgive him. Will Lakshmi return home? Please tell us what the future holds! The planets and moons are not aligned. The Satan clearly wants to kick me. What?! I mean Saturn is staying on the right side of the path! The chances of Lakshmi returning home.. are only 50% Shastri sir, how do we increase the percentage? Everything is possible in Astrology. We can switch genders of a child. We can bring a baby out, or even send it back in. WHAT?! - Inside a house I mean. Astrology has the power to seize all the properties. But if you want Lakshmi to return.. For seven days, in the name of Lakshmi, we'll have to strictly.. Follow the 'Aham Bhanga Prayoga'. We'll have to perform chants and rigorous rituals! Please do it Guruji! Do everything you want. I'm ready! - So? But who's the groom? - He is! Then he has to do them all! He'll have to wake up in the Brahmi hour at 3:30 A.M.. ...and bathe in cold water before he sits for the ritual. You mean I should do this? Nah. I will perform the rituals and marry her! Guruji! - Obviously you should! Aren't you the groom? At 3:30 A.M. After a cold shower, if you sit.. ...down for the prayers. Krishna will peacefully bring Lakshmi back. Say he takes a piping hot shower with Lux soap.. From the rear end to his head, he will be burnt beyond recognition. I won't let that happen. Not just cold water, I'll take bathe in Ice water. I only want her to return Swamiji! Will you follow my words? - He will! Now he's on my turf. Watch me strip you naked and make you sit on the tip of the Himalayas! Two days ago, Krishna had called. What did he say?! Where is he now? He inquired about Master. I told him what happened. Damn it! Where has he taken Lakshmi? He didn't say anything about that. I asked him. He disconnected the call. What took you so long to tell us? Give me your mobile phone! What was the time when he called you two days ago? At around 2:30 in the noon. In the noon.. At 2:30 P.M. There he is! Lakshmi! Stop there. - Friend! Move it! Is she there? - No sir! Keep looking! Lakshmi! Let's get out of here.. Let me go! I'm not here for you! Today's your lucky day! But I won't spare you! He's not here for you. He's here for me! He's my relative, Bharath! He mistook your presence on my boat and is here to kill me! He knew you would tackle him along, so he got some men along with him. Look.. Forgive me. I thought you were here for the girl with me and hit all of you. This girl is mentally ill. She's helping me out. Please don't doubt her. If you still don't trust me, we will leave this boat. Take good care of them! We should never let down those who trust us! I shall leave. Grandpa! Lord Krishna! Only you can protect my Lakshmi! Four days ago, from this very number,.. ...a person made a call to this phone. We've received information from the Cyber crime branch. Did he have a woman with him? Do you have any idea who he was? Sir, you're right. But he seemed new to this town. And there was no woman with him. Sir.. All those who visit this place, stay in the house boats. You might find him there. Alibaba.. Alibaba! Here's some Toddy drink for you! Come closer.. Come closer.. Come spread your nest and lay a trap! Come on, it's time for some fun! Son, will you become a drum beater? Son, will you become a drum beater? Uncle Khader! Uncle Ali! Let's get together quick and sail the boats! This one's a troublesome fish.. This won't fall for your hooks! This one's a big slippery fish.. Your fishing nets just won't be enough. Stay away.. Stay far away! Why are you in a hurry? Stay away.. Stay far away! And son.. Son, will you become a drum beater? To gauge what oyster holds what pearl.. Is an impossible task! To find out what secret a woman holds.. Is a task no one takes up! Quests and Expeditions are the missions of life.. New lessons and learning all around.. And son.. Son, will you become a drum beater? Thanks a lot for saving us from the cops! You got everyone together and helped us! I shall always be grateful to you! Something seems to be wrong with the fire.. Eww! It doesn't seem like you bathed in cold water. It was a hot shower then. Drat! You think you can fool me and take part in this pure ritual?! I shall make sure your body temperature goes.. ...from 98 degree to 119 degree Fahrenheit! *INVOKES CURSE FROM THE GOD* - Mom! Guruji! Please forgive him! He's never taken bath in cold water. I was worried if he would catch cold,.. ...and mixed a bit of hot water along. That was it! Would you mix hot boiling water along with alcohol... ...instead of ice cubes and serve it someone? Nope! Guruji knows it all! 'The Absolute Master', 'The Ocean of Ancient Knowledge'.. 'The Astrological Gem' are some of the titles bestowed upon me! Feel free to keep those titles. Just make sure my son gets Lakshmi back! Nonsense! Why are you crackling like a brick in the smoke? You want Lakshmi, right? - I do! Then you'll have to stare right at the fire without breaking concentration! If you don't, tears will flow from your eyes. And they're no ordinary tears, they'll be tears of blood! You fool! - Do as he says. Stare into the fire! You'll have to stare into the fire with focus and dedication. Do you understand? Take this! May the rituals begin! Didn't I tell you about the music college.. ...students who come here every Sunday? You're lucky they're here today! Follow them! Come on! Quick! Looks like God is leading us to the place we intend to reach! Excuse me! Which music college are you guys from? We're all students of Raaga Music college! Music has caused a lot of miracles! A lot of harsh personalities can be calmed down, and we've done it too. But I'm not sure how to cure a mentally ill person. Madam! I've managed to bring someone who had forgotten.. ...herself, and was locked in a room till your doorstep. Her aim was to achieve in the field of Music. Your attempt to use her goal as a medicine to cure her, is very new and interesting. Please bring her inside. Hello? Let's go! - This is a Veena! Name: Lakshmi. Mentally ill patient. If found, please contact.. Please be seated Madam! She's Lakshmi! Madam! Please don't. I know who you're trying to call. But before you do, please do read about me. Is that really you? I'm sorry. I now understand why you believed that music.. ...instead of medicine, could cure her illness. Only you can prescribe the musical therapy for her. *RANDOM CHANTS* You may now consume this! Mom! What's this? Do I have to eat from the ground? Ask him! Would you like to have some Meat chops, Chaatna, Minced meatballs along with.. ...some Hanumantu Biryani served in a silver plate and fed in a golden spoon? That won't be necessary. But won't eating that spoil his health? You'll be cursed! What do you think of yourself? What is this? Goddess Annapoorneshwari! What do you think will happen if he eats this rice offering? We don't know! - Lakshmi will return by herself. If he refuses to eat this.. Everyone in the house will puke your guts out! Forgive us! Not just sand, feel free to mix some powdered glass along with it! Why not? You morons! You deserve this! Suffer for having given birth to a duffer like this! I will haunt you in all the next seven lives! Shall we begin? - Please go ahead. Goddess Annapoorni, bless him. And for now, accept this offering! You've been blessed. Please come along! Wow! It's a Piano! My friend! Just for you.. Madam's students will play a unique track! Shall we listen to them? Let's go. Are you ready? This was the change, I was looking for. Friend? Superb. Madam, your composition was beautiful. Hats off to your students! Seeing that rhythm and dance still remains inside her,.. I don't think you'll need to stay here for a lot of days. I hope so madam. There's another thing I want her to recall with the help of music. If the students can compose for it, we can progress a step ahead. Tell me what it is. I'll get it done. You were my fostered parrot.. You were my adorable parrot.. Can't see him go through this. It pricked you as an eagle.. It pricked you as a nail in your foot.. Nobody in our dynasty had to undergo such sacrifices. Nobody in your dynasty had pointed his feet at an astrologer. What? You mean that's the reason he's doing all of this? Does it mean he's avenging his anger? Look! Lakshmi's heading towards us! Please join us lady! That is no slipper of nails, it's a bed of flowers. Please come! Everyone! Say your chants! Quick! Jai Jai Ram! Please come Lakshmi! Like you instructed, I've prepared my students. They're ready. Stop it! Don't touch the instruments if you've no idea about Music. Don't kill the music. Who killed the music, huh? Do you know that? This is today's latest trend! Watch me! Stop! What do you want me to stop? Do you know anything about music? Just bragging about it won't do. All you know is to listen to music. What I'm playing is right, listen to it! What was that? I couldn't bear with whatever you played till now. Such harsh notes! Why? The sound of train, all the cacophony,.. Was all of it really meant to cure her? Or was it to anger her more? I don't get your behaviour at all. What are you doing? A mentally ill patient is inside. If she does something untoward, our institute will face the brunt. Please let me go. Let me go! She might.. You asked if I knew anything about music at all, right? Here are some notes I composed. You composed these notes to take part in the New Delhi competition, right? Didn't you claim to know a lot about music? Sing! May this journey proceed.. Progress is the law of the land. May this journey proceed.. Perseverance is the law of victory. The earth and the sky are yours.. To rise and fly, fear won't do any good. You are the best there is.. And who can ever equal you! He sang my composition! You played the instruments wrongly to anger her and ended up curing her. Great. Music managed to cure her illness. But to get rid of her fear, and remind her.. ...of her family, there's one ultimate test left. Lakshmi! Don't be scared. Be brave! Look over there! What happened in the train was an accident. This is devotion. Watch carefully. Did anything happen to him? Watch me do it! - Please don't. If something happens to you.. - Nothing will. Watch me! My friend! Don't! Look here! Don't I seem fine? No! That's the power of the God. You'll have to overcome the fear of fire! You overcame it, right? Now pray to God and light all the lamps around this temple. May this journey proceed.. Progress is the law of the land. May this journey proceed.. Perseverance is the law of victory. The earth and the sky are yours.. To rise and fly, fear won't do any good. You are the best there is.. And who can ever equal you! Master! Krishna's back. Huh? - What did you do to Lakshmi? Tell us! - Will you tell us or not? Do you know what sort of sacrificial rituals I had to endure because of you? I wore slippers made of nails! I ate the mud from the ground. I won't spare you! Let him go! Will you still take his side and celebrate him? I won't! Where is my granddaughter? Where have you hidden her? How much money do you want? 25 lakhs?! 50 lakhs?! Take as much money as you want, but return my granddaughter to me. Return my granddaughter to me! KRISHNA! KRISHNA! The Loved one of the Gopis! Hey, Guardian of the Cows! O' beloved butter thief.. Come by taking gentle steps.. Krishna, come by quickly! O' Krishna, come by quickly! Krishna, come by quickly! O' Krishna, come by quickly! The Protector of Cows! The Loved one of the Gopis! The toddler of Gokula! Hey, Guardian of the Cows! O' beloved butter thief.. Come by taking gentle steps.. Krishna, come by quickly! O' Krishna, come by quickly! Lakshmi! - Grandpa? Take Lakshmi to her room. Okay Grandpa! Let's go Lakshmi! Sister! Krishna! You kept your words and returned my soul back to me! Couldn't you have told us that you've cured her.. ...before we could even hit you? Master.. If I'd told you this before.. All the pain you suffered for the last three months wouldn't have left your mind. That pain would've haunted you someday in the future. Now that you slapped me, you've vented your anger out. That pain has left you. You speak like a psychiatrist. No matter what. I seek forgiveness on.. ...behalf of everyone for having hit you in haste. Master! Please don't. Now go ahead and conduct a grand wedding! You heard him, right? Let's begin with the wedding preparations. What? You've arranged a marriage for me? Yeah. Who's the groom? - Post marriage.. If ever you develop differences, don't ever insult.. ...her by reminding her that she was mentally ill. Look there. That's him! Are you okay with this? Yes! Sister? Sridevi! - Hey! I was watching your wedding video and here you are! We'd beeen to pray to Lord Krishna for your safe return at the Udupi temple! Thanks to Lord Krishna, you came back safely. Krishna is the reason behind my recovery. Okay. Are you all alone? Where's your husband? Not just my husband, my entire family's here. Grandpa has ordered us all to live here.. ...until your wedding with Chetan is over. Chetan? Has my marriage been arranged with Chetan? What are you saying, Lakshmi? We pointed Chetan out to you and you saw that too. Only after you agreed that he understands you well,.. ...did we start preparing for this wedding? I didn't say yes to Chetan. But it was to Krishna. Krishna?! The very Krishna who cured me and got me back. If I'm going to marry, it's going to be with Krishna. Or else I won't ever marry! I don't want a marriage! I don't want to marry at all! I don't want to marry at all! I don't want it! I don't want to marry! Lakshmi! - I don't want to marry! Master! Lakshmi went back to the outhouse.. ...and locked herself inside like before! He took her away and changed her mind. And in the end made her say it out loud that she wants to marry him. What a player he is! He knew he would be accused of this and left home yesterday itself. What? Krishna went away?! He came here, did what he had to do and left. He had asked me not to reveal this until the end. But.. It's time to tell you everything. Lakshmi ended up being the reason for this. So you knew about all of this? - I did! Only after he requested me, did he come to this house. For the last six months, he bore all the insult and yet.. ...continued to do all the work. Do you even know who Krishna was? He's ten times wealthier than all of you! He is the only son of Dr. Ram Kumar, the Chairman of.. ...Shivaram group of hospitals, Dr.Shivarama Krishna. He's one of the top psychiatrists in India. Trika! This one reduces anxiety and lets you sleep well. What was the reason for Krishna to work at our house? The reason for Lakshmi to lose her mental balance.. Was him! When we were getting Lakshmi discharged from the mental hospital.. He was at the same hospital for some work. Having seen Lakshmi's condition, he inquired about her with me. I was in the same train that Lakshmi's parents were travelling in. Devaki, is everything fine? Nothing is fine! We're all sitting separately. Did Lakshmi eat anything? - When would she do that? Ever since she put on her headphones, she's immersed in her music. I somehow managed to feed her two morsels. This time, Lakshmi will ace the All India Music competition. That was the first time I saw Lakshmi. Has your seat been confirmed? The berth hasn't been fixed, my seat is ready. While one was immersed in music without paying heed to her surroundings.. And here was a couple struggling to be without each other. I didn't want this family to get separated even for a night. Sir.. Please take my seat. And let me take yours. But why? Don't worry. Please take this seat. I gave them my berth, and left to another compartment with his RAC ticket. You did a good deed, right? How are you responsible for Lakshmi's accident? The reason for it was a false accusation that my hospital had to face. Three years ago, a nationally recognised powerful industrialist,.. ...Chairman of JK Mines, Abhishek Agarwal got admitted to our hospital. He passed away after four days. Your hospital is being accused as the reason behind.. ...Mr. Abhishek Agarwal's death. What's your response? Not at all! The media ganged up against my father and threw questions at him! They maligned our hospital by accusing us of.. ...carelessness that led to the VIP's death. My father was very disturbed about it. Certain political parties filed cases against us and got the CBI involved in it. After this.. My father's health began to diminish. To find out the truth, I checked the deceased VIP's report. With his sugar level spiking at 380, how could you suggest the.. ...nutritionist to give the patient cashew, almonds and lots of sweets? Sir, the patient's family claimed that it was.. ...his regular diet and compelled us to follow it. That's why we succumbed to their demands. - What rubbish! The patient got admitted on the 29th of March, right? I want to see the CCTV footage from that day. Because of a server issue, the footage has been deleted. Something seemed wrong when our own doctors were in their favour. I doubted if the patient was hiding something when he got admitted.. ...at our hospital, and went to the server room to check it. Recover the deleted footage of the 29th of March from the server. When I saw the footage, I realised that the VIP was already.. ...weak when he entered the hospital and was entering into a Coma. The partners of Abhishek Group of Company kept injecting.. ...Mr. Abhishek with slow poison for the last eight months. Every VIP who visited the patient were stopped from seeing him. I learnt from my doctors that they'd taken.. ...control over my hospital with the help of goons. I decided to head to Delhi to submit all the.. ...reports and CCTV footage of the VIP's admission to the CBI. Krishna! They've learnt about your plan to hand evidence to the CBI. Their men will be waiting for you at both Bengaluru and Delhi airports. When they learnt that I'd not left by flight,.. ...they came to the railway station in search of me. Like you said, he's going by the train sir. Finish him! Assuming that it was me sleeping in the berth, they shot him. They shot his wife who screamed for help. If only I hadn't foregone my seat to Lakshmi's father. The fire accident wouldn't have taken place. The guilt that the danger that came my way ended.. ...up destroying another family, kept haunting me. She should've passed away along with them. Since she was sleeping in the side berth, the other passengers saved her. Sir! Can you do me a favour? Tell me what can I do? - Take me to Lakshmi's house. I'll make sure she recovers. A doctor might cure thousands of patients. But a doctor should never be the reason for someone becoming a patient. Lakshmi's condition shouldn't return to what it was before. I'll convince him and bring him back. Greetings! Are you Lakshmi's family? - Yes! We are. The day he saw your granddaughter at the hospital. He asked me to leave him alone for six month. And that the girl was suffering because of him. He felt that God wanted him to cure her and left.. ...us telling that he won't contact me until then. He returned only yesterday. He expressed his happiness for having cured the.. ...patient and handing her over to her family. Krishna came to our house and lived like an ordinary helper.. ...at our house without bothering about his reputation and wealth. He left us without telling after curing our granddaughter. After being with him all the while, my granddaughter.. ...is now adamant about wanting Krishna in her life. But he left to Europe last night for three months on a break. He had a reason to come home the first time. But now, he has to decide. I'm not upset that Lakshmi said that! Whatever is meant to happen in one's life, will happen no matter what, right? It's enough if Lakshmi's happy. Sir? She's locked herself up in the outhouse since yesterday and isn't responding to us. What did you do to Lakshmi? Don't ever touch this piano again. They might believe that you've gone back to your old self. But I won't. If at all you've become the person you were before,.. ...it means that my treatment has failed. None of my previously analysed treatments have failed. Including this case. I learnt that you aren't happy with the wedding.. ...your family has arranged for you. Remember this. Having been a mentally ill patient for three years,.. ...you had no idea how you were. But having been in this house for six months, everyday.. I've seen your family worry for you. I've seen them lose their sleep and peace for you. Do you know this? Your grandpa's day begins with him taking a look at the.. ...painting of your entire family which is just like a Banyan Tree. He always desires to have his children and grandchildren around him. He spends time everyday with his in-laws too. In today's world, it's difficult to find a joint family. Yet you have a family that always loves you. But you wish to come along with someone who cured you. I don't mind. If you end up with someone like me who is constantly travelling, you'll.. ...miss this house, the grandfather and this beautiful family, right? Now you take a call. Do you want me or do you want this family? I don't wish to separate you from them. A house with a united family, isn't just a house. It's a nation in itself! Friend? Thanks. Grandpa! Lakshmi! Driver! Let's go. Friend? Krishna? Look over there. Krishna! You're not taking Lakshmi away from our family.. You've become one among our family today! Take her along! May you both live happily forever! May you live long!Ayushman Bhava !
