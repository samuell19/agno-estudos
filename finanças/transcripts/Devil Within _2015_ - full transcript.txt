This is the story of the day I found my freedom. My freedom from evil, my escape from the Devil. - Excuse me. Excuse me, ma'am? Hun, you're not allowed out here, okay. The resort patrons have to stay up on the terrace today. Sweetie, I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to ask you to go back to the resort, okay? The beach is closed during high tide. It's extremely dangerous. - You don't know what danger is. Real danger. The fear you feel inside when it comes for you. You can't move, knowing you can't stop it, but the only one way to escape. - Sweetie, are you okay? Are you in some kind of trouble? - You wouldn't understand. - I'm a therapist. Well, used to be. I've heard everything you possibly imagined. - Not this story. - Try me. What's your name? - Emily. My name is Emily. - Hi, Emily, I'm Helen. - I don't have much time, Helen. - Why? - Do you believe in evil? Pure, true, evil? Well, I can say that I believe that people can do evil things, but I've never met anybody that I would say is purely evil. - Then you haven't met my father, David Hayes. I thought he was just sick because my mother died. He said he'd be different. He said, we'd all be happy. But there is no happiness in this life or the next. What happened to you Em? What did your father do to you? - It wasn't my father. My father died a long time ago. It was the Devil. Why don't you tell me what happened, okay? I can help you. I can help. - Fine, but don't say I didn't warn you. It all started when my father got out of the hospital. - You think this is a good idea? - You can't run away from how you feel. - At any cost? - Just forget about her. - I'll be back. - David? David? David. David, what's wrong with you? David. David! - It's my fault, Lucy. - It's not! - She, she needed me! She loved me! - She needed help! You couldn't do anything for her! - She loved Emily so much. She's never gonna hold her again. - Samantha's gone! You can't bring her back! It's my fault! I am the reason they are dead! I'm so sorry Lucy. - David! David! - You coming or what? - Yeah, just give me a minute. - Alright, I'll start unpacking. My father couldn't sleep. He would blackout and have visions of things he couldn't explain. One day he was himself, the next he was someone else. This is how it all began. He killed someone! What are you doing! You gonna be out here all day or what? - I said I just needed a minute. - Minute? It's been almost two hours. - I, yeah, I'm sorry. - Maybe we can find a way to wake you up. Or you can stay in the car. That's good. You okay there? - I didn't think I would ever be back here. - Well, it's home. What better place than to start our new life together with the love of my life? You okay, Em? Do you like the room? It's fine. - Please do not do this. I am trying, I really am. You cannot be angry with me all the time. I need you to work with me so we can be a family again. - You mean you and Lucy? - You are my daughter and I love you more than anything. - She's not my mother. - No, she's not, but she loves you dearly and I am your father and you are still my daughter, daughter. - Daughter? I'm a prisoner. - Okay, can you at least pretend to not be angry with me? - Okay, sure, whatever. - I promised your mother that I would take care of you and I always will. - Then you shouldn't of brought me here. I was fine where I was. - I'm sorry you feel that way, Emily. It will be okay, I promise. - It's not what he says. - Who says? - My friend. - What friend? - What friend? - What the hell? Mr. Bear. We never did get along. At least I didn't try. I was stubborn, yes, but I had my reasons. - Hard at work? Since I'm working from home, I am expected to get these out even faster. - Don't stay up too late, okay. Oh, I brought the rest of the boxes down. Can you bring them in the storage room for me? I forgot the key, I can't find it. - It was locked? It must've been the people who rented the house. I'll take care of it tomorrow. Maybe a small. Can I have one? You do that, right? I can, if you want to? You guys are open until lunch all the time? Yeah, every day. - Hi. - Hi. - What are you doing here all alone? - You were waiting for me? I was waiting for you? No! I thought my father's problems and visions were his own, until it started happening me. I couldn't explain where I was and how I got there. It's been three nights in a row. I woke up in the woods, confused and scared, but I was close enough to walk home. - Hey, hey, where are you, what are you doing? I'm talking to you. Did you, did you sneak out? No. - Don't lie to me. - You act like you care! But all you care about is yourself and your guilt because you didn't help my mom! - You know what, you don't know anything! Get to your room. - I hate you! - That's nice. Meet me back here in 20. - You're gonna be all right. - Why wouldn't I be? I'm sorry. You have to eat something, stop this! - Then stop treating me like I'm five. I'm old enough to take care of myself. No, you are not. - Mom never treated me like this. - Your mother is not here right now, so you have to deal with me. - As if I have a choice. - That's what happens when you're a kid, you don't get to have a choice. You listen to what your parents say. - But I'm not a kid. I'm old enough to take care of myself. Really? - Yeah really, watch me. That's when I met him. - Who? - My name is Emily? Michael. He was older than me. Oh God, I thought he was so cute, but my father didn't like him. He didn't realize that Michael was just trying to save me. And who was Michael trying to save you from? Your father? - No, you're not listening. The devil. How old are you? Old enough. - Hey, David! Hey, how have you been? It's been a long time. - Here man, have a seat. - Great, thanks for asking. Are you visiting? Lucy and I have moved back. - Oh, well you should come by the church sometime. - Yeah, sure, great. - You know, might help to talk about it. I mean, after what happened and with Samantha dead. - Oh, you mean before Samantha killed herself? - David, look, it might help to talk about it. You need God in your life. - Lucy could not care less about those lies anymore. - I decided to be a little bit rebellious, and I went off with him. We were running and I got scared. His grip was, it was really hard and so I pulled back but he wouldn't let go. - Are you okay? - Yeah. - All right, are you okay? Yeah. - Emmy, listen stay here. Where are you going? - Honey, I promise I'll be back, just stay here okay. I'll be back. Who are you? - What the hell? - What do you want with her! What the, get off me man! - Tell me! I'm trying to save her! - My father found us, and when he did, he became aggressive with Michael. He tried to hurt him. Because Michael was trying to take you away. - No, because my father was afraid. Michael knew things about my mother's death more than my father knew. Anyways, my father showed up, Michael fled, and he found Michael's bag. Which, I don't know if Michael left it on purpose. Maybe he did, maybe he didn't. Anyways, my father opened it. What he saw inside showed him the face of the devil. - So he saw the devil? - Eventually, but he couldn't handle it. He tried to fight it, but it turned him against all of us. And when that happened, he was no longer my father, he was the Devil. - So what you're telling me Em is that your father started to have a psychological breakdown? - No, I told you, it wasn't my father, it was the Devil. - You know Em, often times people will use symbols or figures to represent real life pain. If you call him the Devil, as you put it, he's always gonna haunt you. It's been awhile. - Yes it has. - It's good to see you! - Lucy had and old flame, Jack. Jack was a police sheriff in our town. They had an affair. I felt it, - and my father did too. - But better. If they did, they did it well. - 911, right? Who knew what that little business card would lead to. - No, I mean my personal one. For anything Lucy. - Do you wanna talk about it? - Do you? - Hello? Knock. Privacy? - I know, I'm sorry. Em, the guy that we saw today, did you see him before? Maybe with your mother or something? - No. Why? - I was just wondering. - Okay. - Do you see why I push so hard to keep you safe? - Yeah. I can still handle myself. You can't hold onto me forever, you know? - I know. I know. Okay. - I saw her today in town. She looks like she's doing good. Happy. I didn't know you were back. I know you won't talk to me. I get it. Just remember I'm around. In Michael's backpack, my father found a Ouija board, and a map. He became obsessed. He thought this would lead him to the mystery of my mother's death. He kept searching for answers, but only found more questions. This field has torment and everyone suffered. - I'm sorry, okay? I'm serious, it was wrong. - What was wrong was the fact that you saw him while I was in the hospital. - I told you I was sorry. Please, I won't talk to them again, I promise. - Okay. - Really? You bought this thing? - What? - I hate these things. - Oh, I didn't think you were into religion anymore. - Really, it still freaks me out. I don't want that in the house. Don't take too long. What is that? If you don't like it, too bad. Oh. - Taste's good. - You bastard! Now you're getting it! - I'll wear it like that. Oh no, no, no, no, no! - Oh no, no, no, no. - No, put me down! Put me down, I hate that! Put me down, David! - You have a little bit of. - Really? - Food. Give me your hands. Here? - No, in here, okay. - Oh. Close your eyes. Really? - Just go with it. Are there any spirits here? Any spirits at all? Anyone who has anything they want to say? Spirit, what is your name? Samantha. - David. David, come on. - Samantha, tell me what you want. You wanna be free. - David. - Sam, - who do you wanna be free from? - David, come on. - This isn't cute, David! - What do you want to be free from? - This is stupid. It's not funny! Samantha. - Stop it! Stop it! Hey. - I've gotta wake up early in the morning. We're running low on supplies and I need to go into town. Okay. We need a family- - Don't talk to us! Nice family meeting. Oh yes, I believe we do. - Don't talk to us! - You're not a part of our family anymore! Just get out! - Yes it is! - No it's not! - Yes it is! Go to your room! Get out! - Mom! Mom, mom, are you okay? Here honey, take this. Take the bag, just take it okay. Stay back. - Do it. Do it. Do it! - Kill me! - No! Kill me! - Mom, mom stop. Mom, mom, mom stop. - We have to go. - No. Mom, mom, give it to me. - Hey Em. - Where are you going? - I won't be long. - Can I come with you? - Honey, not now. Go clean your room or something. I never felt so alone that day, and my father didn't make it any better. I didn't know where to go. - Pastor John, I need your help. I have some questions about a girl. - David, what's this about? I don't have that much time. I'm preparing for a service. Even if it's about her? - Jennifer Riley. It's been a long time. She was sick, very sick. She needed help. She needed God's help. - What was wrong with her? - Cancer, like Samantha. Fortunately, I, I couldn't do much. I could only offer her comfort. It's a shame really. I just wish... It's not important. - Tell me. - I just wish we could have given her a proper burial. - Why couldn't you give her a proper burial? - She went missing one day. Police thought it was a suicide. There was talk that she jumped into the ocean. - She knew Samantha? - Not really. Jennifer went missing before they could meet. - What about him? - What about him? David, look, I don't have time for this. I have to do a service now. - Please. - Michael Costa. He's a very troubled, very dangerous young man. David, I don't think this is the right time to speculate. - I have to know. - All right. Before he joined us, Michael was a suspect by the police in the disappearance of a young girl from the city. She was drowned, but there wasn't any evidence, so they let him go. David, I really have to go- - I have to know what happened to her. - Look, do me a favor, son, you have a family now, let it go! - David, I can't do this anymore. I thought it was over. - It is. This is not about just Samantha, there are more girls involved. I don't think Samantha killed herself. There's this guy, Michael Costa, I think he had something to do with this. I think he killed them all. - Will it bring her back? What? - Will it? No, she's gone. - Exactly! And I'm here waiting, every day. Lucy, Lucy. Tell Jack I said hello. Glad you get your makeup, I want you to look really good when you fuck him! - David. - David? What happened to dad? - I wanna go out, please! To town, anywhere! - What, are you bored again? I don't have time for your shitty attitude and your goddamn antics! - Do you want me gone like my mom? - Maybe. - I hate you! - Emily. Em? Emily! I ended up in the same place I did the past three nights, in the woods. This time, I wasn't alone. Jack, he took her! - David, what's going on? - Jack, look, - You have to help her. - Calm down. - Who? - We have to go find her. - Who? - Jack, no, we have to go now! - Who! - Emily is missing! - Calm down! - She's been kidnapped. - Calm down! - And he is going to kill her! Get in the truck! - Get in the truck! - We have to go now! Get in the truck! Get in the truck, get in the truck! Get in the truck! Really? - Sorry. Sorry. - Put your seatbelt on! David, a map? - It's his. Michael Costa, he's, - Michael Costa. - Thought maybe we can find him at one of these locations. - Yeah, Michael Costa. - Okay, you mean Jennifer Riley's brother? - Yeah. Look. Her. - Yeah, she went missing years ago. - We have to get moving, I don't have time for this. Come on! - Really, David? Enough is enough, man. Come on, let's go back, okay? - I'm not going back, Jack. My daughter's missing. - Nobody's missing, okay. - She is missing. Where's Emily? - Let's call her right now. - You know what, I've tried. Emily! Em! No, no, no, no! - Hey. Yeah, I'm with him. Yeah, we're on our way back. Okay, bye. - David, enough. - It's the water. It's the water. - David, please. - Jack he's taking her - to the water. - Let me go back. That's where she is. Jack, he took her to the water. - Let's go back and clear our heads. - He took Emily to kill her! - Enough! - Jack, how much time do these girls usually have? - Let's go. - How many bodies. - You don't look good, - Do we recover? - Let's go back! - Tell me! No, I don't look it, I'm fine. What is it with you? You're trying to get Lucy back aren't you? You'll do anything in the world - to get Lucy! - Come on! I can't believe you just took my gun! - Keys. Keys. Keys. - I can't help you David. You're on your own. Holy shit. Lucy, we have to go now. Oh good. Are you crazy? What's going on? - It's Emily? - Stop it. Stop it, David. You're scaring me. - We have to go now. I am not going to let them take you away from me too! - I can't. - What do you mean you can't? - David. I don't know how to say this. I think we should take a break from us. - Is this because of Jack? - It's not like that. - My father and Lucy started to drift apart, and I won't lie, I was pretty happy about that. My father got jealous a lot, he thought that Lucy was cheating on him. So he did what he does, he reacted. Did he hurt her? - No, not physically, but they fought a lot. I think Lucy believed my father was really crazy. And as I expected, she left us. But by then my father, he was lost. He needed help. - Did you ever think Em, that maybe he pushed your real mother away because he knew how sickly he was and that maybe he did the same thing with Lucy. - She wasn't my mother. She was a replacement for my father. My father thought that with Lucy, we could have a normal family, but you can't hide behind walls of lies and expect to never see them when you look out the window. - Where is my daughter? So peaceful? So beautiful. Samantha was right. She was right. It really does bring you closer to God. It's too bad she'll never see it again. - And how do you know Samantha? - She wasn't delusional, she wasn't crazy. She saw what you didn't see. She saw what we didn't see. She went to Pastor John for help. She tried to help Jennifer. They were sick, David. We made it worse. You didn't find the bodies because they didn't drown. I buried them, okay. I took 'em. I told them he was trying to help. Told them he was trying to protect them from the, from the Devil. Even those boxes. He said, he said it would keep 'em safe. It didn't keep 'em safe. It trapped them. Trapped their souls. Trapped 'em for him. He's evil, David. He made a deal with the devil, all right? He made a deal and he paid for it with their souls. Pastor, John. - You can't save 'em. You can't save 'em. It's too late. It's too late. Sorry. - No, no, no, no. - No, no, no, no, it's not. - I'm sorry. No, it's too late. If he has Emily, it's already too late. - Pastor John has Emily. - I'm sorry. He won't stop, David. He won't stop. He took Samantha. He took Lucy. He's gonna take Lucy. He took Emily. I'm sorry. - No, no, Michael don't! - I'm sorry. - I'm sorry. - Listen, listen, Michael. Listen, where's Emily? You have to free him. - Michael, where did he take her? - You have to free him. - Michael, don't do this. - You have to free him. - Michael, where is Emily? Michael, I don't understand what you mean. Where's my daughter? Michael, where did he take Emily? - I'm sorry. - Where is Emily? Michael, do not do this. Michael, no! - You have to free him. - Michael, I don't know, - Free him! I don't know what you mean. No, Michael, no! Michael, no, do not! Where is Emily? - I'm sorry. No Michael, don't do this. The moment my father watched Michael kill himself, he lost all hope for answers. And losing hope is the worst of all evils. It leads to self destruction. - David, where's the gun? Where's the gun at? Drop it, drop it, drop it. Put it on the floor. Drop it on the floor. I need you on the car. On the car, David. Your arm? You okay David? - Jack, you have, you have to let me go. Emily is still out there. - Okay. First I'd like you to talk to somebody. - I am not sick, Jack! And I'm not crazy. - I know. Just listen to what he has to say, please. Trust me. - Jack tells me your daughter was missing. That you think a Michael Costa took her. - No, no. I was wrong. It's Pastor John. He brainwashes these girls and then he kills them. - Why would he? - He gives their souls to the Devil. - You know what it sounds like, don't you Jack? - I know, if you saw what I saw, you would believe too. I know it sounds crazy, Jack, but I saw the Devil! I saw him come for him! We have to stop Pastor John before he hurts anyone else! - Jack will go over there and talk with him. You need rest. - You don't understand! He keeps their souls in these boxes. - Jack mentioned that. A box like this, David? - No, no, you have to destroy it! You have to set them free! - No, set them free! - David! David, David. David! - Easy. All right. It's gonna be all right David. All right, easy does it. All right, okay. That's it. All right David, okay. When my father awoke from that ordeal, he was dazed. He saw a sign when the door opened and the handcuffs unlocked itself. He thought the Devil was leading him to the places he needed to be. Full with determination, he began to prepare himself for the battle that lay ahead. He was a man without faith, blind to the evil driving him. Pulling him deeper into the darkness. Taking all precautions, my father went to see the only person he thought would unlock the secrets of the box, was the man who had all interactions with the missing women. Only one man no one would suspect. - Is she still alive? David, I'm sorry. Where is she? Son of a bitch! Where! - David, please, you wouldn't understand! - Oh, does that box look familiar? - You, you killed them. - No. - You sold their souls. - Yes you did! - No! You sold their souls so you can save your own! You were keeping them prisoner, but I, shall set them free. David, no, please! You won't set them free! David. David, no, please! No! No! As my father prepared to strike the preacher, ready to end all of his pain and suffering, he heard a faint voice in the air. A haunting memory. A cry for help that he fought against. That made him feel as though he was being pulled further into the depths of hell. - How many are there? How many? Did you bury her too? - I was trying to save them, David. The ones I could find from the ocean. - I am asking you one last time, where is my daughter? - We all belong to him now David. You don't know what you've done. We all belong to him. Emily. Okay. Baby. Honey, stay with me, okay. Come here. It's gonna be okay baby. It's okay. - Honey, oh Emily. You have to let me go. - No baby. It's not your fault. - No! I'm so sorry. Emily! Emily! Hey grandpa! - Hey, how ya doing? How are ya? Hi grandma! Dad, come with me. Come, dad come! I'm too old for this, I'm brittle. See what you did? - I watched you die, Michael. - Yeah, well, things happen. - You wanted pastor John dead. That box, it didn't free the girls did it? - I see them more for now. With me. - Emily. - Oh Emily, Emily, Emily, Emily. Geez, you're not tired of her already? Little brat, whine, whine, whine, whine, whine! Trust me, you're better off without her. - You killed her! - Oh, I didn't kill her. I didn't kill her. I'd like to, but no, I can't take credit for that one, trust me. That was someone else. Come on, don't be so bent out of shape. The party's just getting started. You're always afraid. Afraid. Oh, I'm afraid, I can't. Just embrace it, come on, embrace your fears! Let me help you- - I don't want your help! - Hold that thought. Think about Jack. Remember your friend? Yeah. You might have been right about him. Just a little. - Lucy. - Yup, Lucy. Oh no, Lucy. You forgot all about her, didn't you? You were so worried about that little brat, whine, whine, whine, whine, whine, whine, you never thought about Lucy. Don't worry, Lucy's safe. With Jack. - What did you do to her? - It's not what I'm gonna do. Better hurry up. Hurry up. - It's not possible. Dad, stop this! - No, no, you're not real. - Dad, don't say that! It's the drugs that they gave me or something. You're not real! - They didn't give. - No, no, no! You anything! - No, no, you are not real! - We tried! I'm sorry I couldn't help you. I miss you. Dad, please look at me! Tell me everything's gonna be okay! I love you. - I'm sorry, Em. - Oh! Daddy, daddy, stop! Dad, what are you doing? No, daddy! Please, stop dad! Dad! No dad, daddy! Stop! Daddy! David, it's gonna be all right. It's okay David, you're safe. We're here to help you. - What about Emily? He killed Emily. What about Emily? He killed Emily. - He's gonna kill Lucy. - Why don't you get in your car and you drive down to the beach and you're gonna find a little girl who did not stand a chance. - It's okay David, you're safe. We're here to help you. What are you talking about? - Get in your car and drive down to the beach and see for yourself. You'll find her. - No, we won't David. She's safe David, she's here. She's been with me the whole time! - Nice try, Jack! You are not gonna take Lucy from me too. - It's over David! - Yeah, Jack, it is over. - Jesus Christ, David! - Come on, come on Jack. It's gonna be all right. You just have to trust me. I'm not gonna fight you David. - Good. That's good. - Remember, remember what you told me? The day you left the hospital, you told me to take care of Emily. - Stop lying! Lucy is not going anywhere with you! - Lucy doesn't exist! You made her up. You made her up! She's not real Michael! She's not real. She's not real Michael. She doesn't exist. When you lost Samantha, we lost you. - Samantha. Go to your room! Get out! - Mom! - It's okay. - Mom, mom are you okay? Yes sweetie. - And you started talking about some woman named Lucy, how she was helping you. You started calling yourself David. - I remember. Oh my God. Jack, I, I killed Samantha! Oh my God! Her. - Yeah, she went missing years ago. - What about him? - He's a very troubled young man. I don't know what happened. It was as if it all came back. - I remember. It just all made sense to him. Oh my God. My father killed them all. He knew it, but he couldn't stop. Something drove him, moved him to want to kill us all. - Where's Emily? Stop it! - Emily, Em, honey. Honey, wake up. - Stay away from me! - No, no, Em, it's okay! I'm okay. Baby, listen. Go upstairs and find the car keys. Do you remember when I taught you how to drive? Follow the yellow lines baby. Just don't look back, just go! Go! - It's time to get to work. Emily, wait. - Daddy, stop! Stay away from me! Dad. - Dad stop. - Emily, I love you. Dad, stop, don't! Please. Don't. No, don't do this dad! Daddy, don't do this! - You told me in your bedroom the other day that I have to let you go, right? - Baby, I love you. - Daddy! That day, he ended his life, it was for me. He did it to save me. My father took his life to save me from the Devil. I led what I thought was a normal life with my grandparents for two years before they decided they didn't want me, or just couldn't stand the sight of the daughter of a man who could do the evil things he did. They had me committed. I was abused. I was raped. My life wasn't mine. My freedom from this world was gone. One night I ran. If I didn't, I'd die, and here we are. I will have my freedom. - Em, I have some friends that can help you. There's a little place that's called Lake Forest Grove. And we can go there, we could just talk to somebody and if you like it, we can stay and if you don't, we can leave, but I can promise you this, they will help you. - The hospital? You think I'm crazy, don't you? - No, no, not at all. I just think that you need to talk to somebody that's gonna help you through this. - Well, I've already been there and they're probably looking for me right now. You're a patient there? - I was a patient. No walls of lies will keep me prisoner again. I have to be free. I can't let it happen to me what happened to my father. I will not let that happen, Helen. - Okay, all right, so honey, then why don't you just tell me, just tell me what you saw. - Are you sure you wanna know? If I tell you, he might show himself to you and he might follow you next. - I'm not scared, sweetie, okay. I am strong enough to handle it. - I thought I was strong enough, but you will be scared, I promise. Emily! Emily! Emily, wait, please! Emily, Emily, please! Em, please, don't do this! Emily! Emily! - You're gonna show us how much you care about us, like before. Oh, finger gestures. That's not very nice, Emily. You know what happens when you misbehave? What happens? Then we give you the finger. How many though, that's the question. - In my entire life, I have been running from the ghost of my father, running from the fear of the darkness he couldn't escape. The darkness I inherited from him, that was a part of me my entire life. Those voices, those cries, the pain, but I found a way out without giving in. He will never find me. He will never be able to follow me. He's gone. He is dead. The Devil will never return. I am finally free.
