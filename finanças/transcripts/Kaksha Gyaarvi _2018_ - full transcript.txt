Zakir - Is it fine? Check check check Crew 2 - Tanmay can make the announcement Tanmay - Alright ladies and gentlemen We are good to go Are you guys excited? Are you guys excited? Give it up for the very funny, the one, the only Zakir Khan. This was enough. You did according to your capacity. Recently a problem came up at home. I am sharing it. It is personal. We all need to talk about this. This is very serious. Papa is on Facebook now. Did you feel bad? I mean I tried to avoid it. I tried to stop it. I tried my best that this doesn't happen. He used to ask me to open a Facebook account So, I asked him Do you have a passport? He said that it got expired. Then, I told him you cannot open one. But now papa is on Facebook He has added all my friends. All those scoundrels are getting married. They are celebrating at their reception and no food is cooked at home. What is this trend of wedding photoshoot all about? I have all boys' school friends. They never had the skills of doing love marriage. So, they are doing arranged marriage. Even then they are getting a photo shoot done. It has been only three days you got engaged. And only two weeks that you have started speaking with her. I don't understand The photographers have guts They are trying to capture candid moments.. ..of couple who are getting arranged marriage. Because this kind of setting can only have awkward moments.. ..forget candid moments. And on top of that these people have changed all wedding customs. I went to a friend's marriage. Everything was different. So, he asked whether we were performing a dance for the Sangeet? I said Sangeet ? All aunties dance a little bit 'Bano teri...' And that's it. He asked me don't you know? where were you for all these days? I said I was out for 3-4 years. He told that everything has changed. I asked have they changed the syllabus? He said completely. It is fine till the friends perform. Why do bride and groom have to perform? And don't let the bride and groom dance together. As it will look embarrassing. Because 95% boys don't know how to dance. And the rest 5 % are bastards. They would dance like Tere bin ?? Jiya naiyo lagda ?? Mein taan marjawan ?? There itself. beside him the bride is standing And she is giving a killer performance She goes Le ja le ja Groom's parents are trying to hide themselves. He is not our boy. Amongst all my friends the biggest bastards are the boys' school guys. Even today their problems have not resolved. If you go Anyone who has studied in a boys' school? Look this is the calling of loneliness. My boy's school friends who are settled in US & Canada they text me late at 3:00AM in the night, which I receive in the afternoon very serious issues, If your friend messages you late in the night, it means he's in deep thoughts, thinking. And by that serious talks, The conversation ends in three lines He texts, "Hi, how are you?" I write back, "I'm fine" next question "Did you find 'THE ONE'? The problem in our school was that till 5th grade the campus was different. Morality was completely different. In 5th we became big brothers. We were shown a lot of respect Teacher's used to talk Mr. Khan you are 10 years old, you should behave responsibly now. Absolutely sir. Mummy please give me my bag I have to go to the office. Yes Once he even said that you are almost an adult. Our rules were completely different Once a 4th grader called someone a dog. I scolded him. I said hey! Do not abuse. After 6th grade we all came to a different campus. It was a different world all together. Imagine one of your NRI cousins Ones who drinks Bisleri water Oh my God India is so hot. Imagine him. Pick him and put him in The Gangs of Wassaeypur The way he will be shit scared Guys, we really didn't know what was happening around I can't tell you what's happening here. Men studying in 12th grade are roaming here. They have these moustaches like Danny And their testosterones have no parity. They don't know what to do with them.. ..they are banging their head against walls. And abuses are flying left, right, centre... Like you have landed in pochinki in PUBG. From everywhere Left right center One of the 12th boys is standing on one end of the school, his friend Batra is standing on the other end of the school, in the middle Vice Principal and two sports teachers are standing. That guy is calling Batra from the other end Hey Batra, you sister f**ker Batra also replies yes f**ker I'm coming We thought they might get really punished for this. Everyone just overlooked it. Vice Principal and teachers went we didn't hear anything No not all Our school kids No. No What are you talking about? Every class has a boy. And his crime is really petty But he is punished as if he was roaming Because of you You fish rotten fish The whole class feels for him. That he did not do such a bad thing For which he is being punished. That's me. I mean, when I was in 6-7th grade I knew 11th and 12th boys. Because During their board exams they used to be outside the class and I always used to stand outside the class I used to say hi Devashish how are you? They used to say. Do you always stand outside? And in boys' school nobody used to complain about anyone. Nobody tells anything. One day we bent the fan out of shape Why did we do it, we don't know. I swear I don't know why we did it I too want to know Personally, I want to go back with time machine And know what were we doing? Why were we doing? Anything used to happen in the school The school had a round building. Inside there were all classes. And from top floor, 9th A one could hear Dhoom dhoom Chak Then the sound started coming from the top 2 floors. Dhoom Dhoom Chak Within 7 seconds the whole school new which is the next line Everyone together Poor teachers are writing on the board We will Teachers were startled what happened I don't know what mass mentality That too such coordinated mass mentality Nobody used to prompt Nothing Turned the fans out of shape So now listen to the answer Next day the Vice principal came and asked What is all this? Why did you do it? Now listen to the answer He says sir when we went they were straight When we came back they were bent They would have turned because of the wind And this is the class monitor So, forget about the backbenchers and the scoundrels Anything random used to happen Once upon a time, when I was in 7th standard I kept my Math workbook ready For once, my Math workbook was complete I got it checked. The rarest moment of my life I got it checked and everything's set. So I'm talking to my friend Anuj Chowdiah Anuj is the topper of the class He said, Tomorrow I'm attending a wedding. I won't be able to settle my bad I asked him, what does that mean? He exclaimed, you don't know? I asked, what exactly is it? He explained, I basically arrange the books in my school backpack as per classwork, schedule and requirement. I said, "what are you talking about? You tell me, right? He said, yes we can do this! Till now, like a fool, I have been lugging my school backpack around. If I hadn't spoken to Anuj at that moment, I would've suffered a spinal injury so far. And that moment I spoke like a real diva "I'll clean everything" So I opened my school backpack, as I inserted my hands in 4 bats came flying out. All the junk came out pouring. A book from my 3rd standard My 1st standard cursive writing guide Then the one complete and checked math workbook I threw it away, saying I'm done with this. Next day, I reached school like a prince I felt like a floating feather I was elated. My school backpack was that light. Bouncing around like... ?? The math teacher entered angrily in the classroom And announced, "Everyone get your math workbook ready" And all the incomplete workbooks will be signed with a teacher's remark. Whosoever's math workbook is incomplete And mine's all checked And the teacher moved around the class checking everyone's workbook And during the check-up there were complete and incomplete workbooks. And the teacher stands next to me and demands me to open the workbook. I said "I don't have it" But it's all checked. Completely checked She demanded, "copy" I said, "I left it at home" Teacher said. "okay, okay, okay..." So give me your school diary. I asked, "What?" What are you saying? No, no, no, no... I saw determination in her eyes I saw a decision in her eyes that I'll sign a remark in his school diary. So that an example is set in front of the entire classroom. That you don't leave your math workbook home Now I have two remarks and if I get another one, My father will be summoned to the school. And I'm not scared of my father. And I'm not scared of my father. I don't have a problem with them calling my father My problem is, I have to go back home. With the same man my father. Which I think is not safe. And my father is the innocent type of music teacher. Cow, he's the God's cow But for me he's Bruce Lee I'm requesting the teacher to not give me a remark But this is a boy's school So everyone's judging me now. You're not a man! What what? Most of the time you don't feel like taking a stand. But the public in general is fucked up. So that moment I decided that I'll handover the school diary But the school teacher thought I wouldn't hand over the school diary to her that easily. And I'll have to steal it from him And she pulled it off my hand And my grip wasn't that tight Three somersaults. Teacher's look good spanking kids. They don't look good lying face down on the floor. Entire class started giggling But, she fell and I went to pick her up Ma'am, ma'am... Ma'am, I told you not to write a remark And, this isn't my fault I didn't do this on purpose it happened by mistake. And that time, the sports teacher entered. And I don't understand Sports teacher's they are good at sports which are not played at school. In the sense, the school has a basketball court and the sports teacher is a tennis champion. So! You can't even verify his authenticity as a teacher And the sports fraternity think all the beautiful women in this school are their property. So they roam around school with that attitude. Who is the coolest guy around? It is me! Who setup this city, me! How do they breathe, because of me! The sports teacher entered casually He saw the math teacher lying on the floor I'll pick her up And their English is broken. Madam what happens? What happens? No, no! Tell me what happens? What will the math teacher say to this? ?? No, nothing happened But I witnessed the incidence So he understood, it's me. If I were to be some other student He would have slapped him and asked him to be seated on his bench But it was me. He suggested an exemplary punishment He wanted to set an example He thought, no, no, no You won't get slapped This student, will be standing the middle of the school foyer. Like you can mark me as the centre And draw a circle around it. With his hands raised up This kind of punishment in the history of this school was never given to anyone If I were anyone else, he would've slit his wrists But this would've happened if it were an co-ed school. But this is a boy's school. This is exactly how it happens in a tribe If you're powerful they worship you Nobody got punished this way before. So, mister. I'm receiving offerings. Like I'm standing with my hands raised And I see an object flying towards me And it fell here 5 star From here, An éclair And after 5 minutes there's a pile of chocolates around me. During the recess I made my way out. And students are making a way for me Like "Bahubali! Bahubali!" And I didn't understand anything why am I being so respected? My crimes worth was of that of a pick pocket But I am being respected like (a revolutionary Bhagat Singh) And the 11th, 12th standards boys are asking me Sir! What have you done? Sir! Sir! Sir! They were addressing me as sir! What have you done? My crime(for the punishment) that I said. I cannot disclose it And they went crazy. Haw! He can't even disclose it! Boy's school is boy's school. When you're from Boy's school, the first thing you learn about is 'Manhood' There are those who learn machoism in 12-13 years.. ..in boys' school guys learn it in 4 years. Machoism's basic rule is men have to be brave. One fine day someone will ask are you a man? Yes That's it from tomorrow you become brave. What will that mean? You will not get shit scared. It's a great thing. Next day I get out of home. I see four dogs. And I am scared. I went back and I said I am still scared. He said this is called machoism. You will get scared but do not tell anyone. While playing cricket balls are hitting your balls And the boys go Hunh hunh They are sweating Sweating But they wouldn't say That its paining please someone else come The medical assistance come and ask did you get hurt So, he goes where? Didn't the bat hit the ball? I thought it got connected If there is fun, there is a lot of pressure cause of pretentious machoism. A big turn came in my life. When I passed 10th grade Papa told that you have a very bad handwriting You must become a doctor When he read my writing He said son no one will be able to read your prescription No one will be able to buy even a paracetamol looking at this You would become a great doctor You have the skill, only thing you need is a degree He said since you have to prepare for PMT Join some coaching he said you have to change the school we need school with less timings so, I was admitted in a co-ed school This is a normal school There is no problem with the school. But a person's history matters a lot Where has that person come from makes a big part of who that person is? So, I came and I had come from a boys' school. As I entered I could feel a sweet fragrance Look I know the smell of the sweat that runs down those mustaches. This one was new Fragrance of flowers That was the first time I understood That girls have fragrance in them And when you come from a boys' school you know exactly that this is something different Early morning 7.30 school I reached school at 7.15 It's new, nervous boy I quietly kept the bag Saw 10-12 people in the class 2 boys are arguing at the back of the class 2 boys are arguing I was minding my own business One guy kept hand on other's shoulder and said it is okay man This guy in rage dashed his hand And the other boy hand got hit against the table In anger he blurted out are you a bastard? As he said this, the other people in the class exclaimed Hunh I swear So, this guy, who said it, realised and uttered Oh shit Seeing all this I burst out with Hunnnhhh Seeing this I hid under a bench I was like what place is this, friends? What kind of a world is this? After 2 minutes I saw folded cloth in boys' hands I asked what is this? They said it is a handkerchief. I asked why have you folded it and kept it They said to wipe something I said okay okay They asked don't your parents give you a handkerchief I said yes they do But we don't wipe with them They asked then how do you clean? I said They asked then what do you do with the handkerchief I told Tie a knot on the ends Soak it Co-ed school has girls In Bio Angels And the angels had a princess Whose name was Natasha And Natasha was so beautiful that So beautiful that you start thinking that this girl should be my girlfriend She should be my wife But Natasha was so damn beautiful That I didn't have that emotion My first emotion was to give up I said these things have nothing Let's leave it Nothing will happen It is just a waste of time Let's go! Everyone in the world used to hit on Natasha People were crazy behind her And beautiful girls after a point of time come to know that this world is a fucking place So, she didn't use to talk with many boys Except the new comer Sakthi! I have melted a lot that is how I have become tough Natasha used to talk only with me Then we started going for chemistry coaching We used to stay together all the time For the whole day And some people's personality is so over powering That when you stay around them I don't know whether it has happened with you or not Probably it has happened with me Might have happened to you too All the time you feel Jhanjhan jhanjhan Right Do you remember? Whatever she used to tell I could understand everything This is happening That is happening He didn't like a guy called Nandkishore Nandkishore was earlier her classmate but when I had come he had taken commerce and had gone to another class, he was her classmate He was a tall guy Those guys whose height just shoots up in the summer vacation of 9-10th grade. Remember? After that for 4-5 years they don't know how to walk. They don't know what to do with their feet. They are randomly moving their feet And Zakir Enjoying? I said you mind your own business She used to say What is the problem with Nandkishore He talks into your mouth He should at least brush I said you are right Mister, However strong group of boys you have 10 or 5 together I am saying that a girl who you don't hit on bring her to your group it is very important request her, plead in front of her ask her to tie rakhi but bring her into the group because when she comes your personality will evolve like anything that thing cannot happen when men stay together Man is such a fucking lousy tribe We don't want any kind of change I went to Indore some time ago Came back from the US Called up my guy friends And asked them Assholes where should we meet? Everyone is doing really well, good jobs I thought they would suggest some hotel He goes let's meet at the tea stall In 15 good years they have not changed their hangout place Then I called my girl friend She called up you have come to Indore so let's catch up Tell me, when can we meet? Let's meet for lunch or dinner What would you like to have? I said I want to eat Indian So, she goes I ate Indian food for lunch so I can't have it again Can you see the difference? Those bastards can you hear the difference? She is not repeating a cuisine These people couldn't find a different place in these goddamn 15 years. I am having a good time at coaching Life was hunky dory So in the class there was this rumor that someone will get beaten up I thought I will go Let me also see who is getting beaten up Nothing happened I didn't see anything Nobody knew anything, Nobody got beaten up. Anyways I used to stay with Natasha So may be I missed out on something Nandkishore came to the class And Zakir he is in commerce what is he doing here I asked what's up Nandkishore? He said did you have fun yesterday? I said in general what is your specific question? He asked didn't you meet Karan? No, I didn't I said who Karan? He said you don't know Karan? I said please tell me if Karan is some place's Amitabh Bachchan. He said Karan is looking for you to beat you up. Me? What did I do? He said he will only tell you once he meets you. I said okay, okay, okay I asked who is Karan? Then I saw him. If I blow he will need to comeback Don't judge him looking at this He has a gang of 22 people I busted into laughter He has a gang Who are those 22 fuckers who follow him? He said it is not his gang it's his father's gang I said oh! This seems to go a little out of hand. I said okay, who is his father? You don't know his father? I said you only tell me Don't fool around that you don't know this one or that one His father is a murderer. He has done 3 murders and is in jail right now. I said okay, okay, okay. what does your father do let's not talk about irrelevant things Next day we went for coaching Unfortunately, Chemistry teacher's son was taking the class. Suddenly Nandkishore enters the coaching class What was Nandkishore doing in Chemistry coaching class? He says Sir please send Zakir Had he been an old sir, he would have shooed him away Whatever you want to talk do it after the class. Get out This young teacher chickened out He pinned it on me Zakir Yes sir do you want to go out? There is a thing called survival instinct She is sitting beside and stopping me to go out Don't go out they might throw shoes on you. Avoid He is saying right thing. Had I heard of survival I would have got saved Whatever the situation be But men have this fucking thing Because of which 99.99 problems are happening in the world And that is Male ego This guy sitting next to me said What are you talking about? Don't listen to her You ought to go out I asked why? He said men are supposed to be brave I said right this I have also learnt I know this He said Men face the challenge Go out And he has challenged you in front of 60 odd people When did he challenge me? This is how you get challenged I got out I thought he would stand there at the door I stood at the door Nandkishore said come on I said what is the matter Tell me here only I said say it here He said He said no, he wants to meet you in the deserted lane after these three lanes Okay okay okay I mentally prepared myself Okay. I will hit Karan with my elbow If he attacks me Look we all are heroes of our own stories We all want to win I was fully prepared As I moved towards the lane Only a distance of 50 meters was left As I crossed that line and I could see that lane my heart sank into my stomach and my lungs busted out as 25 guys were standing in the lane My survival screamed Listen just run right now I turned and started running That very moment someone grabbed my hand I said Nandkishore leave my hand Nandkishore said I have not grabbed your hand As I turned I saw the male ego He asked where are you going? I said to save my life. What are you saying? So many people have seen you You have made the eye contact Now you cannot run away Men face it They don't run away I said. Men should actually run You stay healthy cause of that People are not running That is why so many people are getting heart attacks I went into the lane There are around 25-30 guys standing Someone has a stick in his hand Another has hockey Someone has a pole Yet another one has a bat, stumps And Karan is sitting on his bike in the middle He is smoking cigarette If he is smoking like this It means we can still talk But Karan was smoking in maddy style Someone came and told him Zakir has come he put off half cigarette on his speedometer A complete show off of the rich Fuck I don't mind picking up the smoke from the floor Put off half cigarette Swagger Karan jumped from his bike As his feet didn't reach the ground He jumped Walked two steps. And stopped Then he took out Dilbaag from his pocket How many of you don't know what is Dilbaag? Alright You know Vimal right? It is his younger brother Basically, it is one kind of tobacco It was a 5 rupees packet And it has so much tobacco in it Even if I give 4-4 of it to each one of you Half of it will be still left That one There are some people who are very fond of eating tobacco They eat 2-3 grains after dinner Or after having a drink just to change the taste He used to eat tobacco To make sure he gets cancer So he took out Dilbaag He tore it and ate it Those who eat tobacco know There is a style to it He didn't throw the packet He flipped it Now I have a problem I was raised in such poor surroundings That I didn't even have 1-rupee coin to toss while playing cricket So for most of my life I tossed with the tobacco pouch Because on one side it is written in English.. ..and on the other side it is written in Hindi See only the poor ones are clapping And why not Fuck let everyone know What have we achieved 25 boys have surrounded me 5 boys have blocked my way on the road My life is under threat Neither I have ever had a fight Nor I have ever got beaten up Anything can happen at this moment What should be running down my mind at this moment? What is going on in my mind? I am thinking English English, English, English... Hindi I said it is an unlucky day He came towards me said I said yes He said You I said yes, me Why do you complain your sister-in-law about me? Why will I, Complain about you.. ..to my sister-in-law? Firstly, I don't have a real elder brother Moreover, I have cousin sisters-in-law and they stay in Ahmedabad I haven't even spoken to them for 3 years I said look my sisters-in-law stay in Ahmedabad And I have never spoken to them about you. I have just come to the school Why will I talk to them about you? He started laughing Did you get it? Forget me the one standing behind didn't get it. Everyone is wondering I said Okay. Let me explain He says Why do you complain about me to my girlfriend? I said I don't know your girlfriend I don't talk to any girl Why will I complain about you to your girlfriend? You know her I asked who is it? He said Natasha I went crazy Just like in CID episode after he gets slapped he admits to tell All clues start connecting together I was like And all clues start connecting together For 4 months Natasha never told me she had a boyfriend She tries to be very hygiene conscious and this what she found? Now the conversation changes Now it was not about Karan it was about betrayal in friendship I hangout with you the whole day At least you could have told me that this is the guy Whatever You met did not meet Could have given a few references Natasha? I told forget everything Tell me specifically what did Natasha tell you? He said that I cannot tell you Tell me what Natasha had told you He said why will she tell me anything? I asked why? He said I do not get to talk to her. I thought have you gone mad? Then I understood that it was like a universal sister-in-law concept Where the sister-in-law herself doesn't know how many brothers-in-law she has? Guys get happy just like that The one just went was mine Fucker Then I tried to control the situation I said look Karan Natasha and I never talk about the goons and gangsters I said that honestly, I have never spoken anything like this to her So one of those oddballs Asked from behind Swear on your mother? I said I can swear on my mother Male ego clearly refused survival said please you have to swear I said sorry I can't he pulled up his sleeves I said swear on my mother I didn't say anything else And since I had sworn on my mother It was the heights of truth I had told all the truth He said look you have sworn on your mother but Are you getting it? You have sworn on your mother so Technically we cannot beat you up I sighed Tension free While I was just thinking this he slapped me really hard But I feel like doing it When someone touches you, with all their might, and without your consent, you feel really bad. My limbs went numb Body stopped responding I am feeling angry feel like crying feeling scarred I am feeling all this But I am showing none of these Of course A little thing like this says so much about us we try and show everyone that everything is alright 90% of us boys when get slapped do not stroke our cheek We fix our hair If someone says how can you take the beating Why were you standing mum? just ask fucker were you standing there? I just could manage to say one line My voice was breaking I cannot cry in front of these guys My hands are shivering I said You wanted to hit me, you did that Can I go to my home now? If you are satisfied now should I go? But because they were 20-25 boys I left from there after 10 minutes I reached home Mummy and papa are taking a nap in the afternoon But today Both dolls were up and about Papa is reading the newspaper And mummy is peeling garlic outside Creating a mess She only has to pick it all I am crossing the veranda Just then my mother looks at me She asks how did your pant tear Earlier it used to tear from here I said no it hasn't She said not from here From the knees the stitching has come out I said this I fell down from a bike Her elder son fell down She got up and came to look closer Asked where else did you get hurt She saw this side but didn't see anything But this side hand was bruised, elbow was bruised shoulder was bruised she asked how did you fall from the bike that you got hurt on both the sides Though I didn't say anything But answer was exuding out that the road squashed Just then mum looked at my cheeks Earlier they used to be flat And now circumstances have made it like this One could see a four-lane express highway this side She says one minute How come you have finger marks? I said no no nothing What nothing Did someone hit you? Tell Come on tell And my mother is blabbering And I am feeling weak I have got beaten up I am feeling really weak Mummy is constantly asking me And I felt like yelling at her I don't want to talk to you It's a sign of a weak-minded man He tends to shouts on a woman But I didn't shout Because Papa was standing there Otherwise he would have shouted on me No one will raise his voice on this lady except me Dad just got up and left He doesn't care about the story He's sitting very indifferently. Then my mother changed her tone And once your mother starts asking you things in that tone Even if you are 50 you won't feel more than 5 years old Mummy started asking me Baby what happened? Did you fight with somebody? Did someone hit you? My little baby Wouldn't you tell mummy? You tell everything to mummy my baby you tell everything son tell your mummy all those who say a man cannot cry lie we need someone who can ask us Mummy made me so comfortable That I told her that Yes somebody beat me up I saw my mother transforming Her stole was put aside Hair disheveled Eyes burning like amber Four arms forming Trishul flying from her hand Thick kajal Tongue lolling A garland of human heads goes flying around her neck My mother transformed into Chandika She too is a mother It is a mother and son relationship Don't feel awkward That how a Muslim's mother transformed into Chandika? Let this mother and son relationship remain secular Post that my mother did the most embarrassing.. ..thing in the history of motherhood She took my hand and said Come on take me to them who have hit you Point me towards his house How can they beat you? I will teach them a lesson She was full of rage We reached in front of Karan's house She asked me, which house is it? I showed it from afar She reached the corner house of the third lane Where is he? Take him out? Do you go to school to become a goon or to study? Look at my son's face is completely bruised. Are these some kind of manners? I stopped her mummy mummy You keep shut don't talk in between I said mummy this is not the house She said why didn't you tell me earlier? I said but you were not listening She said shut up Even your father tells me things incompletely I thought now what can I do about it? Your whole clan is like that I was like In complete anger Mummy reached in front of Karan's house Where is he? They stopped her. And asked Did you take a token? There's was a house of goons and gangsters Everyday people used to come and shout So they were distributing tokens We were third in the line He gave us a slip They had put benches to wait We went 5th Two people even negotiated with my mother and went before us They're asking, aunty, what is your case? My son was beaten up. Is he alive? Yes... The thing is, actually him... Beta, you go ahead His brother-in-law was murdered Okay, okay, okay... So please let them go. The last rights are remaining can you let them go? My mother is like Yes, yes for the last rights and everything the community should and will help. My mother suddenly became understanding After 5-6th person my mother went inside They had made this stage My mother got performance anxiety She was standing there in an awkward manner Is this the way Tell me? The whole anger got diluted with all that socialising she did She said Is this the way? Where is that boy? Bring him out? He has bruised my son's face? You could hear people giggling inside An uncle came from inside and said You are absolutely right sister We ourselves are really worried He consoled her and sent her out He pacified her And sent my mother back We were walking back home I told mummy bygones are bygones It is between you and me Please do not tell Papa My mother swore on sun, moon, stars, dust, grass, trees, rivers, everything She said do not worry son It is between you and me How many of you feel that your mother keeps your secrets? Do you feel so? Do you feel so? Okay okay No one is a bigger asshole than you Only for 10-15 people here For your understanding let me explain to you The man against whom you are trying to manipulate her For two minutes don't think that she is a mother Just think of her as a woman For two minutes don't think that she is a mother Just think of her as a woman The man against whom you are trying to manipulate her She is hooked to him for last 25 years Who are you, teensy one? Between them you have zero value You were just 11 inches when they brought you home And in that you used to poop 6 times They used to look at each other and ask what should we do he has pooped Who is going to clean him? They used to lift your legs and clean your asses Do you think this couple would keep a secret about this? Till two-and-a-half years you are calling your mother to clean your poop Mummy I am done Do you think they will respect you? As soon as my mother reached home She told my father each and everything as if she was sewing.. ..one pearl at a time. Today was really unlucky I was beaten up Nothing happened when we went there I took my books and sat on the table to study I am analysing the right and wrong I shouldn't have come out of the classroom I should have held his hand when he slapped me We all want to win be it in the heart But we want to win I was trying to win in my head So basically, I thought about one thing. I cannot go to school now because I got beaten up I have to become a thug there's nothing more to it. I have to be a thug because I want to take revenge. Who do I take revenge from? All the 25-26 people and also their friends So there are like 80 add people in the list So I made a revenge list And now I'm a thug and my revenge is also complete I'm not going to school as well So what do I do? I'll set up a business venture then. I'll set up a business venture and earn a lot of money. Earn a lot of money A lot, a lot. Then I'll be rich I'll be the richest man in India Then I'll go to USA And I'll buy Los Vegas I'll buy it entirely and I'll have sex day and night No mister, I was just thinking I'm pretending to study while thinking about all of this. Just then my father came He asked what happened? Did something happen today? I said no nothing at all He said mummy was telling something I asked what did mummy tell you? Papa said no nothing She was just saying that he is looking a little worried I got it I said papa it is just a little stress cause of studies Alright Now papa wants to have a conversation with me When two men talk it is a very awkward situation Because both have zero vs zero skills Papa is also a little confused.. ..should I address or shouldn't I that I know about it It became awkward And as I am a grown up now he wants to have a man to man talk I am standing there He too is planning what should he say I am also quiet and pretend of reading a book I said DNA RNA DNA Then he asked me Did someone beat you? I said NO He asks sure? I said we just had a tiff He asked should I come to school with you? I said oh! Please Don't do this He said son if you have any problem please tell me I said of course not I said yes papa I will definitely tell you I am so into a shell that he is unable to understand how he should tackle me So he told me something He said look son this is your learning stage If you had a fight You start sitting at home You know how to sit at home after this But how to go to school next day after this You would not know If you don't want to go Don't go Do not pretend by putting up your uniform But this is your learning age And as many uncomfortable situations you face, You will evolve more You will get prepared for the future Right now you are feeling that it is a bad day Life is really long It might get worse But you have to prepare for it today Do you understand what I'm trying to say? No Tell me in short He said go to school I know I never move on with my life because my father caught up on my every basic plan. I would've owned Los Vegas by now! But, for that to happen it was necessary to miss the school. He caught on He said he'll drop me off tomorrow to school. No, no.. He said no I will go I thought that nothing should happen at the time of the assembly As papa has come to drop me As papa dropped me I went inside I thought only 20-25 boys had hit me And not the whole school Who would come to know And you know when someone is bitching about you You get the feeling you have the intuition The whole class is talking about it You could hear the key words Natasha Karan Nandkishore Zakir Closed lane Bat ball Kicking summersault Sewage I am listening everything In the second period Natasha comes to talk to me I am busy writing something Beauty gives you so much confidence that you can't even imagine She puts her face between my face and the desk Says Hi! I wanted to tell her that I am getting all these beating because of you I want to say this to all the girls That you don't know about this story But it is your story You all are Natashas of your life. But your Zakir has not told you Please respect your guy friends As your beauty enhanced Your friends payed the price for it The lip gloss that you put because you think your lips get dry Its redness has our blood in it I thought she didn't know After talking for 5 minutes she tells me Look don't walk too much It will hurt In 4th period Nandkishore came to the class Says And Zakir What's your name? Somnath tell me one thing There are two people One who has beaten you And one who called you outside for the fight Out of the two whom you should be angrier at? The one who called you Do you know This is my personal theory There is no science in it That men has not advanced from last 900 years We still live in a tribe from inside All these are rules of the tribe That we can tolerate death but not betrayal It is such an awkward thing That the person who beats us seems right to us Means he is not morally incorrect He said he will beat you And he beats you It is right what is wrong in it? It's absolutely correct. Social science fails on it You can be friends with the one who has beaten you up I mean best friendship Ohoho I mean I should puke in his marriage After a grudge of 2-3 years you have a normal friendship He can be seen putting chairs on my sister's marriage But you can never be friends with the one who called you. Whatever happens We can never be friends Whatever happens I will never talk to him Even if I am sinking And he is the last person who lends his hand I would shove him Get lost it is better to die than to get saved by you Nandkishore came and sat beside me He puts his hand across my shoulder and asks What's up Zakir I said lay your hand off He says oh attitude Then he started teasing me He got beaten up! Do you know if you slap him he bounces back? If you kick him on the stomach he does summersaults I am scared My hands are shaking I just want to get out I want to escape I want to get out of the classroom As I was stepping out of the class Someone grabbed my hand from the back I said male ego leave my hand He said I didn't hold your hand When I turned back It was Survival He said if you don't give him an answer today He will bother you for the whole life Say it Now the asshole I know the fuck Dare anyone say anything That time I didn't know what to say I thought hard what should I say So I said yes So he teased that you got beaten up I asked so/then what? I didn't know that 'so/then what' has that much power Whatever the talk is If you say so/then what? Statement just becomes null and void If you say anything like Nandkishore was such an asshole Such a fucker Even he too took 10 minutes to recover this But did come out of it He was a big-time fucker He said. So. So. So So did you enjoy it I said no He asked do you want more I said yes I do He asked do you want it now or afterwards I thought what direction are these questions taking? I said I want it now He asked do you want it sweet or sour I said sweet Do you want it cold or hot I said asshole I told I will tell it in your ear He said come on tell me As he put his face forward I slapped him really hard And told him I didn't enjoy yesterday But I definitely enjoyed it today After that his friends beat me up That day when I went home I saw my parents shivering Police was sitting at home And he was sitting relaxed I thought even I was beaten up My parents are sweating Summon was for the neighbor He did not pay his electricity bill worth Rs. 2000 His family has left the town Because of this electricity department got the police Papa and mummy gave him 2000 rupees He took it and left That day I felt They are not capable of handling my adventures It happens that reality hits you you are partying outside yeyeye and when you come home your father is counting money and says that there is not enough money to pay your fees this moment comes in all middle-class families this kind of moment comes that moment came for me I said to myself come back Down. Down. Down. On the ground Stay here I thought I want to finish all this I don't want to get into fights any more I don't want to become a goon. Those are goons' kids They have to do that for their whole life I cannot do it I am a teacher's kid Early morning in the assembly I went to Karan I said Karan And the whole environment of terror Why should I live in that? Let's finish it Whatever it is right, wrong, good, bad Let's finish it I went to Karan Assembly lines start forming a few minutes earlier I went and told him Karan I want to talk to you Karan I want to finish all this He said yeah so finish it Ask for forgiveness I said I am sorry He said Say it in Hindi Your ego hurts big time I said please forgive me Again, from the back those oddballs kinds said Fold your hands and say sorry He said fold your hands and say sorry Please forgive me Now say that I will never talk to my sister-in-law Natasha in my life again Alright I said I will never talk to my sister-in-law Natasha in my life Karan told me do you know why did we hit you I asked why? Actually there are 2-3 more boys who flirt with her Now when I have hit you So now the right example has got set I don't know from where I got this inside I told Karan Even I want to tell you something Yes, tell me I said I will tell you in the ear He said ok tell I gave him a tight one Teachers came Everyone was fighting They are trying to rescue As the dust settled I saw my father standing at the gate I went completely numb I am totally gone Talks are going on in the principal's office After looking at all the evidence and witnesses This happened That happened My father heard everything He only said Sir on behalf of my son I want to apologise Please give him one more chance I had nothing to say We got out of principal's office Got down from the stairs Came to the corner of the classroom Here I have to go back to my class And he has to go to his office He has got late He made me stand in front of him Lifted my face like this You did not think about my reputation You hit in the assembly And I had asked you to tell me I was full of anger and rage I told him Men do like this only You don't know anything He caught me Said one minute Do you think you did something courageous? If you were courageous you could have told me On the first day Were you able to share? I said no I couldn't share You slapped him right Yes I slapped him What do you think was more difficult? I said that So are you courageous? I said no He said you are an asshole Abuse from your father's mouth? Do you think you have become a hero? You haven't done anything great that your forefathers have not done. I was like, what? His father used to study with me in a government school That time I also had slapped him But I didn't want to became that kind of a man That is why I have become this kind of a man And I know I am way better than him Alright Next time if anything happens Your job in the school is to study Your job in the college is to study And not to save lives I said what are you talking about? Really? I want to tell everyone All those boys and girls who go to school Your job is to study Rest your parents and teachers are responsible People cut their veins I was brave I could tolerate it He said Don't live in fear But don't even do all these things Manhood is about expressing And not keeping to your self. Go back to your class You are the son of a lion. Stay like that And if you have to apologise Don't fold your hands I have beaten all their fathers It is enough to have one troublemaker in the house I am there I will take care of everything Go and study And don't tell all this to your mother Father? My father? He is walking like this In freestyle He is walking like this What are you talking? Really? Tell me the truth You know When you are 5-8 years you think your father is a hero In 9, 10, 11, 12 you find him okay Then in 13, 14, 15 you feel It is okay he has just raised you That day After a very long time I developed respect for my father Say whatever My father is a stud That's it from my side Thank you very much.
