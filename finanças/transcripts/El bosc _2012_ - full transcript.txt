MATARRANYA'S CATCH M ENT, TE RU EL ST. BLAISE'S NIGHT (1916) Buried in this field are my parents' parents and their parents. Each generation gained a little more land for the house by clearing away the trees. Until here, in the grove, they came across the lights. They come 2 nights a year: when it's coldest and hottest. On St. Lawrence & St. Blaise, at home you stay! Swear to the adage, Ramon: "On St. Lawrence & St. Blaise, at home you stay". Swear it! Speak to no one about the grove, no one. Only the desperate go in there. And they never return. Never. TWENTY YEARS LATER Come to me, Rositeta. Dora, my shirt. Do you think these are times to go to mass in a red shirt? You're right, Ramon. Hello, Dora. So? All ready for the harvest? Are you really interested? Of course. I want to know how many hired hands you'll be exploiting this year. You want exploiters, talk to the people who establish oil prices. It'll be using two. Too much of a tyrant for you? I'm not using any. You wouldn't even use yourself. Dora. Fusteret. - My God, Rositeta's grown so much. - Yes, she'll be going to school soon. And you'll be her teacher. Better if you're not drunk, though. I don't commune with water. This is inspiration for the cause. Come on. Such a big church and so empty. Such a small casino and so full. Any day now the reds are going to do something dreadful. They say they teach you to read at the casino. They also dance jotas and hold séances. Someone from Barcelona comes sometimes to teach them the higher principles of the ideal. I'm not surprised the casino's full. The chaplains practice politics and the reds give lectures. What's she doing here? Her man caught her in bed with another and she's taking communion. I would have shot her. Mine. The State won't speak out until knowing just what happened... and taking measures. Part of the Army representing Spain in Morocco... has risen up in arms against the Republic revolting against their country. With shameful acts against National Power. The State says the movement's limited... You fucking bastards. Show your faces if you have balls! FASCISTS What's the matter? Fear is for dogs. Everyone talks and nobody knows anything. Nothing ever happens. I'm here, aren't I woman? Yes. So don't worry. It's the town, Ramon. Ramon, there's smoke in the belfry. Where the hell are you going with that hoe? - Where's your luggage? - What luggage? Are you crazy? A revolution is a carnival with bullets. Run away, run away. And where do I load the house? Forget him. Mr. Mayor. Olive trees will dance before he gets in the car. Do you know why rabbits are always scared? Because they can run, like cars. They're here! Go hide! Where is he? - I'm going to... - Get away from her! Son of a bitch. I said leave her alone. Look in the hayloft. They won't hurt you, Dora. You bring wolves to my home and want me to thank you? Oh, Joanet, if you father could see you... What are you doing? Fucking hell. How could you waste bullets on hens? Coixo's right. Come on, let's go. How time flies, right Dora? Remember when we used to play in the river? Just yesterday we were little and look at you now, married and with a daughter. But the world changes. We were just kids when we went to the river. Now I have a daughter and a husband. Because I wanted them. And this is how he protects you? I would never have left you. I'd better go hide up in the mountains. Don't worry, woman, this will only last a few days. Come, Rositeta. Come. Come to me. You didn't remember? 3 hard knocks and 2 soft. Close the door. They won't catch me, that's for sure. It's St. Lawrence's Eve. The lights will be out soon. They say no one ever returned. Maybe they didn't want to. I always come back. Ramon, what are you saying? I'll hide, but I won't leave the house, no way. Tonight I go into the lights then it's in God's hands. You're going into the grove? You said the lights lead to the devil's world, or worse! I prefer the devil to the reds. - Ramon, and our child? - Be quiet, woman. If I don't know what I'm doing, who does? When we married you said don't mention the lights, not even to you? What do you want, woman? For the reds to catch me? For me to be eaten by wolves? Look what happened in the mountains. I can't stop a war I didn't start, but I can enter the lights and get out, I swear on the house. Damn, woman. Didn't I say I'll be back? If you do, it won't be for half a year. Here. Take care of our girl. I'll be back for St. Blaise. Will you marry me? Swear it! Rositeta! Run away, run away. And where do I load the house? The cart and noticeboard square's a festival after a snack of eel in sauce and ox stew. Cloud of dust and slanted light, the brave pull together with cries of excitement, all part of the festival. Also the sad brass band that accompanies it off and on. There are those who think the animal suffers... Now that's real poetry, right Coixo? Yes, some think the animal suffers, but what does the fool know about another's suffering? What does the ox know about another's suffering? - Dora. - Hello. Her too? Ramon's field isn't his anymore. You're right. All lands belong to everyone. And what comes out of them is everyone's. Hers too. We don't fill fascists' baskets here. Fascist? Dora, do the fascist salute. What? Salute, fascist! Raise your arm! The right one! Your right arm! Does that look like a fascist to you? Here, give me that. Dora. No one knows where he is, but we all know he won't be back. Go on. What do you give her? What? He comes and drinks milk from your breasts. Get off me! Leave her alone! - What! - What? - Where's he hiding? - What are you doing? Lower your weapon! Lower your weapon! Not even the Moors stab girls! Dora, I can't protect you forever. Leave the house, come to town. The revolution created a phenomenal invention. It's not a periscope or an electric wheel. It's the future, Dora, the future. Look at these walls. What do you see? A thousand years, all the same, like the waves in the ocean. If you stay here, every day will be like the next and the next and the next, until the end of time. Dora, we can choose our future now. What do you say? - So, Coixo? Did I do a good job? - You should be actors. I don't understand what you get out of it, if she won't tell you where Ramon is. Ramon... You promised us a gift. A gift, yes, a gift. Yes. Here. These are poems, your poems. For you to feed your spirit! When I talk about money, I don't mean gifts. And when I talk about gifts, I don't mean money. Ramon. What's the matter? I told you I'd be back. And yours? - My what? - Your bowl. The rooster usually crows now. The reds stole it from us, right? I knew it. They are despicable. That's the revolution: you grab a gun and eat other people's hens. What's the military doing? They're not moving from Zaragoza. Damn, this is just going on and on. And Coho'? I'd bet a donkey he's after you. In his own way, secretly and from behind. Am I right? Come on, tell me. Ramon, they collectivized the lands, the town, everything. - What the hell does that mean? - Money is worthless. You can only buy using some cards they give you. Goddamn Satan. Goddamn Satan! Men. On the other side there are men. - People like us? - Like us, but like sea bream. Sea bream? Fuck, I can't explain it any better. Like sea bream but like us. Do you understand? Like this, elongated but without tails. Do they believe in God? You mean do they go to mass? I don't know. They have artichoke-shaped houses. Can you believe it? Houses like artichokes, with no corners. Ours is better. A sea bream man hides me in the attic of his artichoke. You want to know something? You won't believe it. The sea bream all sleep in the same bed in their artichoke. The little sea bream too. What do you think? To get to the land of the sea bream, you have to cross the lights. And when you're in the lights, it's like you die. Memories from your entire life rush into your head. The memories most imbedded in your brain. I came back so you wouldn't worry. Hold on until St. Lawrence. They're after me, they won't hurt you. Ramon, are you sure you'll be OK? Didn't you hear me? Mr. and Mrs. Sea Bream hide me. There's a harvest there too. I'll help out and they'll see I'm not a nuisance. Here. For Mr. and Mrs. Sea Bream. They hide you, it's only Christian to show thanks. Don't you understand? There's no war there, no hardships or hunger. And you have no food stamps, dammit. What about them? Do they give them food or do they have to work? Come, Rositeta. Here, here. Settle in, settle in. I told you. A good view. Good water. Good air. Aragén air. Look, Dora, a ham. Good morning. Mrs... Mafia'? Capt. Henry Pickett, Abraham Lincoln brigade. Internationals. My men have leave in Barcelona, but there's no transport for now. We were told we can stay here. Here? We won't bother you. Just until the truck comes. That man said so. We can't stay in the village. The anarchists are there; there would be problems. I don't understand. Nor do I. Never seen a black man before, have you? Over here he could even become an officer. Everything's possible in Spain. Shoot, everything! That's why I'm here. And your husband? My husband wouldn't understand what you're doing here. And not defending your home. Really? That's why we're different. I am defending my house. Leave her alone! Leave her alone! We're on a roundup. There's a fascist on the loose. Just one? Weren't there thousands? Is that the fascist you're looking for? You already caught him. Hey you... How does it feel to deal with real soldiers? Don't like it, do you? We're leaving. THE WAR OF WORLDS Dora, have you ever read this book? We don't read much here. It's about a Martian invasion. The Martians land in London and are about to conquer the world. Do you believe that stuff? Well, I don't see it as question of belief. The book is a metaphor. The author's trying to say the imperialists have stomped all over the peoples. So it wouldn't be strange if one day they treated us the same way. Martians, blacks, yellows... You get it? Well that's reassuring. They won't do anything to me because I have no intention of invading Mars. Well, your country was once as imperialist as England or the US. And like it or not, until we accept that we're all part of the problem. It's true. My country is this house. I don't know if it occurred to you, but the only Martian here is you. I like that. I wanted to thank you for this morning. It's OK. I need a drink. We've been here for months. Months! Still no transport to Barcelona, no orders to return to the front. How long can I keep the guys in check? You're their Captain. Would I be a democratic officer giving them orders they don't want to obey? They came to fight for freedom and they're denied the right to die for it. While you decide whether to die or kill for freedom, I'm going to pick blackberries. This must be the only war where the only thing that happens is that nothing happens. You won't be staying here all summer, will you? Well... are we really such a bother? No, no. It's not that. If you can't give them a war, give them a party. Say What? In 4 days it's St. Lawrence. There's a town near here, Calaceite. It's famous for its parties this time of year. Take your men there. They need some fun. And don't worry, I've spent many nights alone. Very well. No, no. Thanks Have a good time. Have a good time. I can't stand parties. Don't worry about me. I've spent many nights alone. Hi. I'm writing my parents. And what are you telling them? Lies. The lies save pain. You must be very tired. If you do to bed early tonight, no one will reproach you. I was saving this bottle for victory day. But why wait, huh? Come on! We're friends now, aren't we? Come on, just one drink. Don't like it, huh? No. It's awful. You may have never heard this. What strange music. Can you dance to it? Dance? Promise me you'll go to bed. You should go in. The nights here are treacherous. OK. I think that would be best. Good night. Good night, my lady. Good night. Are you crazy? The militia set traps all around the house. - Traps? - Yes, traps. This is disgusting. Or maybe... Oh, yes, yes. I've never in my life tasted anything as good. How can that be? Listen. Tonight... would you like to sleep in the house? Ladies first. I need some air. No, I'll go... Ramon. If they saw you, they'd kill you. These men didn't steal our hens, did they, woman? You made me swear I'd never talk about the grove. Ramon, we don't do what we want, we do what we can. There's a war on! You're right. There's no war there. There they have bridges, many bridges. I'd never seen so many bridges. When night falls, the sun sets with a creaking sound, like splintering wood, and for a moment, their world turns red. But the next day the sun's out again. You know? They have these six-legged animals, like our dogs, but they don't hit them. They do this there... they don't hit their dogs. Ramon, next time the next lights come, the war will have ended, I'm sure of it. You'll come back home, Ramon. Rosa's talking already and asks for you everyday. You'll be back, won't you? What are they doing to me? I can't kill you, and I don't want to die. Hide the sack. Thank you. Goodbye. Goodbye. Take care of yourself. Goodbye, Dora. Thank you. Bye. Here's her food. She hides it here. Is it a sin to have food? You're so despicable... Not to have it. It is to hide it. You don't have an army to feed now. And we don't want some fascist to eat it, do we? If you want fascists, the front's full of them. Is that good, Rositeta? Here. Rositeta. Hello. Good morning, Coixo. They don't know I'm here. Times are tough... We're even low on food in town. Look, I brought you some bread. Some cheese. And even sausages. Dora, you should think about eating and not making scarves. If not for yourself, do it for the girl. If I take it, what will you want in exchange? Nothing. You do favors just because, or they're not favors. Ramon would say you want to buy me with a crust of bread and pork. Ramon isn't here. And if I wanted to have you, a rifle would have been enough. Come on, Rositeta. Ramon won't be back! Think it over. You said you'd watch her day & night, always. We do, day & night. I swear no one went in. She eats every day. Or she'd be all skin & bones. Coho, he's fight. No one's gone into that house. At least not since the communists took off. So who's taking food to her? Tell me! Durruti's ghost? He doesn't bring us any, how's he going to take it to her? Seven and a half! Even the dog is full. She has no harvest, no ration book. And you say no one went in there. I thought we'd abolished money. We ran out of chickpeas. What we'd give for a handful of chickpeas and chorizo! Lentils. Always lentils. We're tired of lentils. Dr. Negrin's pills! What a great war. I'm sure we'll win it. - For sure. - You're such a philosopher, Fusteret. Where the hell do you hide the food? What are you doing here? Bastard. You bastards! Don't tire yourself, there are no crabs. Fusteret, I can eat crabs or leather, but my daughter can't. I know, I know. Sure. You don't drink because you still have something left besides booze. You have to take care of Rositeta. - And Ramon. - Ramon, yes, Ramon. - Why do they have it in for him so much? - He has land. The others don't. Very little land. God. Speaking of things we don't have, we don't even have a political boss. It would have been enough for him to come to the casino. And he never came. Why? Because he was so devout? No, because he was antiquated. If he comes back, it will be soon. For St. Blaise. But I don't know if he wants to, I don't know. For St. Blaise? Why for St. Blaise? Are you sure? I'm not sure about anything anymore. Here. This is what's left of the revolution, a crab that walks backwards... What are you doing? Are you drunk? They're already upon us. Hey, Fusteret. And this? What is this? You withheld these orders so the brigades wouldn't go to the front. And I made up others forcing them to stay. The government could go without a few soldiers. But not Dora. The republic was a woman. At least we've protected one. How did it go? The world turns, and to the cave Ramon returns. To you, Ramon. It's better to bless the return of one than to curse the flight of a million. Where is Ramon hiding? I don't know! Poor me. I don't know anything... Fusteret, Fusteret. Where is Ramon hiding? Where is he? - Want to know what I do know? - What? What I do know is that we made a revolution to change the world and wound up making a war to see who gets the sausages. Fusteret! Where? Where is he hiding? Ramon was coming home for St. Blaise... For St. Blaise? Why? Why for St. Blaise? It's too late, Coixo. It's not St. Blaise until tomorrow. Such a shame, isn't it? By just a day. Ramon's coming back tomorrow? If you leave for St. Lawrence, you come back for St. Blaise... Ramon is coming back home. What's that? That lightning. What is that? Dora, I just want us to be happy. We can be. There's another life, another world. Think about France. France? You really believe I'm thinking about France? He didn't come, Dora. The whole town has fled. Everyone! The Moors are a stone's throw away. No one's coming but them. You know what they do to women? What will become of Rositeta? With no father, no mother. We can't stay here. Come on. Let's go. Dora! I can smell the Moors! What made you come back? And what made you come here? Don't move! Is this your damn revolution? They showed me another revolution. Know what it is? I no longer wish you any harm. I told you not to move! Don't move! Now you go. You'll be back in half a year. If you want. But I don't think you'll be back. It's scary to go in, but you have to be very, very brave to come back. Believe me. Are we at war or at the theater? Captain, Sir, do you know what today is? - Do I look like a calendar? - No, Captain. I only know that yesterday this church was full of reds. And today it's full of Moors. This war is an absurdity. So you are... Ramon Piquer Caldutx. Ramon Piquer Calduch. Can you prove that? I'm wounded. I was shot when I... In this town, on July 18th, out of 208 inhabitants, 204... that is all but 4... belonged to a red union. Is that true? I don't know. Could be. You don't know how to count to four? I treated them as neighbors, not numbers. I never had it in for anyone. I'm Catholic. Yes, Apostolic Roman, of course. It says here... that you were a member of the powers that be in this region. The powers that be... in this region... There go your powers that be. As you see, it's easier to catch a red than a lame man. You're so witty, Captain, Sir. Can I g0? Did I tell you to go? In this sector of the front, there was only surveillance being carried out by small groups of militiamen. Everyone knew the way to the National lines. A small path watched by a yokel sitting on a bench. If that's right, why didn't you leave the red zone? If everyone knew this small path that was watched by a yokel and if it was so easy to leave, why didn't you people come before now? Fusteret. Get off of me, dammit. I'm not a sack. Were almost there. You go on, Dora is worried. Come on, let's go. I said get off me. I'm fine and you have a bad leg. You're not going to tell me where you were, are you? You wouldn't believe me. I'll be right back to get you. I always come back. Ramon. That woman has suffered a lot. You just shouldered me a little and you're gasping. She's shouldered you all this time. You, Rosa and the house. And they told me to lay off the booze... Well it's a good thing it didn't lay off me. - Did you hear it too? - Yes. They're knocking at the door. Do you know what tonight is? Exactly. Ramon, either you go down or I will. I imagined it would be you. My wife wouldn't let me come down before. Come on in. What? What's wrong? Rosa, get back inside. Back inside and go to sleep. What are you doing here? It's Mr. Sea Bream. He needs clothes. Wearing that he looks... like what he is, a sea bream man. They had a war break out. Don't worry. I'll return him to the grove tonight. He's very bright, he'll manage. - What are you saying? - He's not like us. He's not from this world. Don't you understand? Yes, I understand. Do you? Mr. Sea Bream has some strange ideas. Strange for sea bream even! Ramon, did he take you into his house or didn't he? He's like the reds. But from the other side. Redder than a tomato. Get it? Sure you want to keep him? We don't know when he can go back. Listen to me: You're going to go in there now. You'll dress Mr. Sea Bream or whoever. You'll give him dinner and put him to bed. And he'll stay here until his war is over. Did you hear me? I think the sleeves will be short, what can you do? You're taller than a tree. Go to sleep, it's OK. Drink up, drink up. Good, huh? It's local wine. Don't finish that, I like it too! Dora, this is Mr. Sea Bream. He's a little shy, but he knows how to talk. I showed him while we were played cards. He's a little rusty with the language, but he's very bright. So? You like it? We make good houses here in Matarraña. Dammit... Don't scare him, man. he just came from a war. Rosa! Come here. Hi.
