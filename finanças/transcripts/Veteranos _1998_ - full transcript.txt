Everything I've ever gained in life... Has been at a price. But I just paid the ultimate price... I've lost my carnalito. My little brother Bugsy. My homeboy, my camarada E, that vato's gone. I've got nothing left, but the power, money... and a better business. I'll tell you, holmes... Some things ain't worth the risk. Penitentiary chances is one thing... but when I took chances with my brother's life... and my homeboy's life... I finally realized... that world is nothing, without familia. Money and power... It ain't a thing to me. The only thing I'm out for... is revenge... even if it means my own life. You see, I'n both feared... and respected in the streets. I'm a legend in the barrio. I'm known... as a veterano.

From what I've heard, he's staying at his girls' house. So we're about to pay him a little visit that's long overdue. Who is it? - Pizza's here! We did not order any pizza. - I think you did. This is the right address: 187 Rockingham, right? Yeah, that's the right address, but we didn't order anything. You're lying! Get out and pay for it now! Man, what the fuck? Man, ain't nobody order no fuckin' pizz Ahh, shit! (girl screams) - Shut that bitch up before I give her something to scream about! Bitch, I said shut fuck up! Hey, what the fuck? Dyno, man! Shit! Stupid sellout! What? I run the streets! You didn't think I was gonna find out you talked to them peckerwoods? Man, I didn't say shit, man! I swear, man! Shit! Shut the fuck up, motherfucker! Cut his ass again, Dyno! I just got one thing to say to you. I hope the money they paid you was worth this! Let's get the fuck out, man. Yeah! Hey man, what about her? What? Oh yeah... BAY BRIDGE San Francisco International Airport OAKLAND Yeah, come in. Casper! What's up, Chuckie? Alright, man. Missed you. Missed you too. - So how you feeling? Alright... I mean, the painkillers help me out a little with my legs. So how's business? - The only business that matters to me is taking care of that filthy Mexican that's caused us all this pain. I can't believe he took John from us. Tell me about this motherfucker. Where's he at? What's he about? Dyno and E were a bunch of fucking nobodies until we came in and we gave their asses a job. Now he thinks he's some big-time drug dealer. Took over all our dope spots. He took everything from us and left us with nothing... And what can I do..? Look at me, Look at me... I'm a fucking cripple! I can't even go to the bathroom without shitting on myself. Is that why you picked up the bottle..? What am I supposed to do? What am I supposed to do..? I can't handle this. Throw me the phone - Why..? I got a couple of down-ass fools that'll help us out. Yeah, what's up, Mike? Yeah, it's Casper. I just pulled into town. Why don't you go pick up Whitey, shoot through here in about an hour. Yeah, same thing we discussed. Time to handle some business. Alright. Late. What's up, homies? - What's up? What's up, Santo? - Hey! Any of you guys want a beer..? What's up, Santo? Drew, he's probably thirsty. Hey, man? What's going on, carnal? What's up, Tony? Hey, carnal... Um, I want to talk to you for a minute, eh.-Orale. Santo, was the original veterano of the streets. If you had a question or a problem... He knew the answer or the solution. That vato was big-time. The only one that's been as big as Santo, was Indio. My main supplier right now. Yeah, Santo had it all... but it all went down hill after he got locked down. His wife left him for some whiteboy. She took his daughter too. Last we heard his daughter ran away when she was 10. Nobody's seen or heard from them for years... and Santo's never been the same ever since. Hey man... we hit Black Sam yesterday. I know. I heard. Yeah..? How'd you hear so fast? - Got my ears on the streets, holmes I know things... I just wanted to let you know myself, eh.-Simon Simon... Check this out, man Killing Black Sam was revenge I understand that, But why'd you have to take out his old lady? Man, come on... She just happened to be there at the wrong time, carnal. My little brother's gone, holmes. It's made me heartless. All I got is you and the homeboys. Being heartless can get you killed. I know... Those fucking wetbacks just killed that nigger Black Sam. Fuck! There goes our five-dollar snitch. There's a million more where he came from.-Damn right. Anyway, I don't want to hit 'em up right away. I want to play with them a little bit. - What do you mean? I want to hit 'em up, but I want to hit 'em where it hurts. You take that motherfucker's money, you take the only thing he has left. Exactly, Chuck. That's why we start out with his runners. His little baggage-handlers. We'll make that motherfucker squirm. Then, we take out his main supplier, we got that spic by the balls. If we take out his supplier, then we have two Mexicans to worry about. That's alright. That's why we make his supplier think that Dyno set it up. Then those wetbacks will kill each other. And how're we gonna do that? Well, the money he loses from us taking out his runners, is gonna set him back to the point where He'll have to call his supplier for a quick come-up. Then, we jack his supplier and make him think that Dyno set it up. And how're we supposed to know when and where to jack his supplier? Like you said earlier, There's a million sellouts out there. Money has a funny way of influencing people. Money? I think you mean pesos, bro. You can always but some beans with a couple pesos.-(laughter) Man, that's fucking 10 bucks worth of food stamps, All I want's a five-sack, man. You know how much beef jerky you can buy with that..? Orale, man. Just give him the fucking shit, eh. I don't want to hear his stupid whining. He whines and whines. Always Man, come back with some fucking money, alright? Jacksons and shit. Alright. Alright.-Tired of this shit. This ain't no Food 4 Less. - Ain't no freebies, eh. Always try to get over.-I know, eh. Merry Christmas, motherfuckers!(Maniacal laughter) Give me that shit! Fuck, man! Must be half a pound! Come on! Let's go! Let's get out of here! State your business? What..? Fuck no, man. Oh, hell no Man, you sure nobody saw nothing..? Oh, fuck... Alright, carnal. Hey man, keep asking, ask everybody, bro. Go to the corner store, everywhere, man. Oh, man. Get back to me, man. As soon as you can, bro. Damn! What happened, ese? That was Duke, man. Somebody blew away John and fucking Pelon, bro. Fuck! You're telling me somebody came to our barrio and got our homeboys..? And killed our homeboys..? That's our gente, holmes! - This is fucking bullshit, eh! It's the fucking middle of the day, man. Some motherfucker had to see something! Man, we can't go asking around right now anyway, bro. What the fuck you talking about? Man, Duke said it's crawling with fucking hoodas, man. There's chotas all over the place. Let's go pick up Santo, man. He's gotta know something Yeah. He's got to know something and we're gonna find out, eh! Damn! Ya know, one thing's for sure, Somebody's gonna pay the price, holmes! Fuck this shit! I mean, it was funny, but it wasn't that funny. I don't understand what the fuck you found so amusing. It was hella funny 'cause he wished 'em Merry Christmas and then shot 'em. It was hella funny. - I would've said "Feliz Navidad," but I can't talk the beaner talk. Well, whatever. The only thing that matters is that we got half a pound for nothing. Hell yeah, for nothing. Line me up. I wanna get stimulized. Are you on sherm? We ain't fucking up our own supply. You better sniff some Sandnigger camel dick and balls! (Laughter)-I can't (Laughter) - Hey, seriously, man What's the next step? Put the word on the street that the peckerwoods are back! Then we start slangin' these zips. We'll take out a couple more of his runners Put these "eses" out of business. Eventually that fat spic's gonna have to call their supplier. Then we fuck 'em both. Are you sure one of the Mexicans will sell him out? Tell us where they're meeting? - Of course. I already have it covered I found out where his two boys were posted, didn't I? One phone call, find out where his other boys are at. What's up, carnal? I'm sorry. I heard what happened. What's the word, eh? I'm stressing, holmes. Is this gang-related or what..? I don't know Can't tell, it's too soon. You sure nobody saw anybody or anything? Nah, man. As far as I know they were by themselves, eh. What should I do, eh? I feel like going, shooting up them vatos from South Garden. Chale, holmes. You don't wanna go starting a gang war for nothing. Just be patient. I'll know for sure tomorrow.-(scoffs) Okay..? - Yeah, holmes. Just, just keep me informed, eh. Simon... pero ponte trucha. Yeah, I know, eh... What's the word? What's up, Never? What's up, Santo? What's up, Mike? So what's up? Is it gang-related or what? Nah, eh. He'll find out more tomorrow though. Man, who else could it be, man? We should just hit 'em up anyway Hey check it out, carnal I know your blood's hot right now... But if you go acting foolish, all you're gonna do is bring down a lot of problems on us... Just Calma la... And if is those fools, we'll hit 'em up when they least expect it. Yeah, he's right, eh. Right now There's all kinds of pigs everywhere. So what the fuck we gonna do? You guys still have that pound I gave you, right? Yeah, like half of it. Well, check it out, eh. Call up some sure-buyers, 'cause we need to make that feria back real quick. Alright, man. What you gonna do? I gotta hook up with Drew and Crooked. Supposed to hook up some more C-R. Cool. alright, well handle that then. - Gracias, carnal Santo. Alright, Santo.-Orale. Los vemos.-Alright, eh. Let's jam. Alright, man, thanks a lot. Looks like our shit-brown friends are gonna be coming back from the hillside estates, in about an hour and a half. So since there's only one road in and out, I want you guys to make sure you're out there waiting for them. How many are there? How many tacos can you get at Jack In The Box for 99 cents?(Laughter) Two, right? Of course, ya fucking 'tard! Come on, I don't eat that spic garbage! Shut the fuck up! Hey... Hey! Anyways, we gotta make this look like it's gang-related. That way those spics will go kill some other spics. They'll never realize that it was us. This time we gotta get better firepower. Last time that freakin' 380 almost blew my fucking hand off at the drive-by! Definitely. I know this one dude that, uh, Black Sam was telling me about. He's supposed to have all the good shit. Got the MAC-10s. He's got the 45s, the TEC-9s... - That's what I'm talking about... - Yeah, everything we need he should have. Well who is this guy? - I don't know. I never met him personally. I know they call him "Fed X." - Fed X..? Some half-white, half-spic, half-breed motherfucker. Oh fuck, another coconut, huh?(Laughter) Sounds like a self-loather. He should just kill himself.-He should. Hey, well after you guys get the guns that we need... I want you to make sure that he does kill himself. And then, you guys go wait on Highway 14 for those fucking wetbacks coming through. You don't want me to go with them, do you? Well if you don't want to go with them, you better go to the nickel-arcade or something. An hour to myself. Why? You got company coming over? Something like that, Chuckie.
