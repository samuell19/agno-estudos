He was unarmed. Yet you shot him. Publicly. You're a police officer. You can't take law in your own hands. Sir, he was Mohammad Gori's trusted shooter. He killed five innocent people in last two months. I didn't want to risk more lives... ...by giving him an opportunity to flee. So you killed him. There should be a difference between them and us. What is the law for? The law isn't just for gangsters. It should also help the police sometimes. Sometimes police officers like you forget this. Don't try to teach me... ...what I should remember, and what not. Until we don't conduct an inquiry on your actions... ...you're hereby suspended. Who are you? Shetty sent me. Where is he? - Inside. What do you mean? - In the lock up. No need to worry. Shetty has given me permission... ...to carry out the deal that you were going to do with him. Whatever is going on between Sawatya and Gori... ...you know that very well. Don Manjarekar is dead as well. Shetty's in the lockup. So who's left? You. So, what's the point in fighting amongst ourselves? Are the goods ready? Where's the money? First the packet. I never saw you with Shetty before. How long have you been working with him? Since yesterday. Yesterday? - Yes. I locked him up yesterday. Why you... Inspector Bhonsle speaking. Ganga is down. Now there'll be some peace in the city. Papa. - Papa. Papa. Papa. Another businessman, Sunil Malhotra... ...was shot dead on the beach in broad daylight. Like all the other murders in the past month... ...this murder can be the job of Mohammad Ghori... ...or Sawatya gang. When Mohammad Ghori and Sawatya were together... ...they had a strong hold on Mumbai. So strong that there would be no bloodshed in Mumbai. But since they separated... ...they've been shedding blood of not just... ...each other's gang members but also of innocent people... ...just to get a stronger hold on the city. According to sources... ...Mohammad Ghori has raced ahead. And has become quite dangerous. And Sawatya has grown quite weak. Whatever the truth is. But one thing is certain... ...that our police department is doing nothing. We all know about your escapades in the police department. And even know that... ...the underworld is standing tall on four strong pillars. The first is, corruption in the police department. And the second is, businessmen... ...who take the help of the underworld... ...to solve their personal issues, and fund them. And the third is politicians... ...who involve the underworld to get rid of their opposition. And the fourth is, those who risk their lives... ...only to prove their might. The gangsters. By studying the loopholes in our system... ...these people have become so organized... ...that our department has completely failed. And the department requires... ...constitutional amendment to deal with them. But, even if that's possible, it will take a lot of time. So, I've thought about it and reached a decision... ...that, we start another department along with this one. And this department can do anything... ...which we can't do due to legal boundaries. And I want you to head this department. And you choose your team as well. Putting it in one line, Mahadev... ...consider that your department has to save our department. Shiv. What do you think... ...will they ever take you back in the police force? I did my job wholeheartedly. It's difficult to do a police's job... ...within the legal boundaries. Because one never knows when that boundary is crossed. Bharti, my problem is that... ...being a police is not just another job for me. I know, Shiv. That's why I am asking. If they don't take you back, then what will you do? I don't know. All I know is that I am made for the police force. I told at home that you've been suspended. So? We've to take our own decision. What did they say? Bharti. They believe that every police officer has a trait. What do you think? I don't know about the other police officers. But I've never met anyone nicer than you. I love you, Shiv. - Me too. Hello. - Shiv. This is Mahadev. Mahadev? Did you forget the 'Yerwada' incident so soon? Sir. No, sir. How can I forget? I don't forget easily as well. I want to meet you. When, sir? Tomorrow at 11 o'clock. I will message you the address. Who was it? Mahadev sir. I first met him during the Yerwada operation. 'We don't know the exact number yet.' None of the police top officers... ...have reached at the spot. According to me, only an angel can save the children now. Who's the in-charge here? - Sir, that's me. What's going on? Sir, there's was a barricade. Some people fled to break barricade. When we followed them, they hid in the building. What is the situation? Sir, along with Khurshid, there are nine men in there... ...with imported weapons. They've taken 30-40 blind children as hostage. Two constables dead, and one injured. Inspector. Save me. Don't throw me down. Save me. Move back. Don't you understand? I just want to get out of here safe and sound. If you let me go, everyone will be safe. Otherwise I will kill all the children one by one. Like this. Khurshid just threw a helpless child... ...from the building to his death. Lawyer sir. Lawyer sir. Everyone's dead. Now the police are coming, to kill me. Khurshid, surrender yourself. I will handle everything in the court. Let me talk to the inspector. Here, here. Talk to my lawyer. I want to surrender. Look, my client wants to surrender. And according to the law... ...you'll have to arrest him alive. Who told you that your client is alive? What would you have done in my place? Forgot about his past murders. He killed two of my constables right before my eyes. I heard that you're on a long leave. - Yes, sir. The witness turned against me in the Ansari case. And there was an inquiry against me. And suspended. We've a bad habit of taking risks for our duty. Yes, sir. Anyway, let's forget it. I am making a team. And I want you to be a part of it. What team? - Department. Our department has just one motive. Underworld. Just like the underworld is terrorizing the city... ...we've to terrorize the underworld. They always uphold the law. And we'll teach them a lesson beyond legal boundaries. We'll have to take strict decisions in this department. And we can also make mistakes. But remember one thing. Mistakes that are made intentionally, are not mistakes. Gauri. Gauri. Gauri. Quiet, rascals. Whenever someone mentions Gauri... ...I lose my mind. Guari. And do you see. The people are saying... ...that Gauri is a bigger man then I am! Bigger man. But the world doesn't know that... ...Gauri made it this far because Sawatya was behind him. It was me. The rascal. And the scoundrel backstabbed me. If he's a real man... ...then operate from Mumbai like me. Can he? He'll die. He'll surely die. One day that rascal will surely die by my hands. I will kill him so brutally... ...that everyone will remember for years to come. Sawatya, why are you raking up the past. The past is history... Let's talk about the present now. Gauri's men killed four of our men today. And you're stopping us. DK, you think Bhairo will be waiting for you... ...saying "Come and kill me". Even if he's, he'll lying in wait... to kill you. Don't underestimate Gauri. And what if he underestimates us in the meanwhile? I admit that you've a sharper mind. But, being short-tempered doesn't help. Keep your mind cool. Sometimes, keeping cool messes up the job. Listen to me carefully. There's a risk in killing Bhairo right now. Our business cannot survive without taking risks. Sawatya. Our business thrives on risk and fear. Nasir is right. In today's time it will be wrong not to take risks. And even you made it this far by taking risks. Hey! I don't have the time to explain to you two. This is my gang. And everyone will do as I say. Understand. Rascals. Be prepared, and I will tell you the time. Rascals. Sir, I was tired of deciding what was right and wrong. You did a big favor by taking me in this department. No one does a favor, Shiv. One only chooses talent. Yes, Satya. Yes, I am coming. And I am bringing my colleague along. Hi, darling. Why did you take so long? Work. Work! I thought you grew tired of me and renounced the world. Don't listen to her. She has a humorous nature. Satya, that's Shiv. Hello. - Hi. And, Shiv, that's my son Rinku. I am famished. Serve the food quickly, or I'll eat you. It will scorch your mouth. Will you take a soft drink, or direct food? He's Shiv, he can even eat cold food. Just tell me what you don't like. Everything except for you. I mean, everything. But you're special. - Liar. We were at peace until Gauri and Sawatya... ...were killing each other. Rinku, careful. But suddenly they changed their strategy. Enough, sister-in-law. I don't eat too much. Thank you. I am a police officer's daughter... ...and another police officer's wife. I know how much police officer's eat. If you like it, ask your wife to call me. I will tell her the recipe. He's not married yet. So when do you wish to do it? I haven't thought about it. Go for arranged marriage. You cannot trust love marriage. Hey, I'll slap you. Hey, I am not a pushover gangster. Do you want me to find a girl? There's a girl. She's a doctor. Doctor? And police. Deadly combination. One will shoot, and the other will save. Wow. Baby. Your problem is... that you just listen. You don't think. Look, why are you starting now? Let me be. Look, baby. You handle most of the gang than Sawatya. He gave you a break. But you don't see his foolishness. Quiet! I am already in a bad mood. Don't make it more. Just get on with it. You're crazy. That's why I like you. Don't forget, that Sawatya became what he is... ...only after he separated from Gauri. Are you instigating me? Instigating me? But it's not making any difference to you. Prove that you're a man out there, not here. We've just received news from the Crime Branch... ...that Sawatya's men are on their way to kill exporter Shukla. We don't know who they are. But we do know that... ...when Shukla will be entering his office from Loban alley... ...that's when they'll attack. I want everyone to track him. Everyone will be carrying audio-video transmitters. Don't leave them alive. Be ready, he'll be here soon. Whether its young or old, man or woman. Keep an eye on everyone. Don't try to get closer to him. That guy in the yellow shirt, keep an eye on him. Check that guy wearing the sunglasses. No, sir. He's blind. Keep an eye on the shopkeepers as well. It's not him. Let him go. Shiv. Shiv. - Sir. Check that Burqa clad lady. The job's done. What job? What job? Shiv, that's Bansi. Hello. - Where are the goods? Yes. Danaji. Go closer to Shukla. I want to hear. Danaji. Shukla can be attacked any second. Give me alms. Give me alms. Get lost. Please spare me some alms. - I said get lost. Get inside. How many are they? - Three, sir. Quiet. Shiv, get rid of Bansi and get back to Shukla. No, no. Don't kill me. Done, sir. Those three beggar have weapons, understand. Attack from behind. You're on a roll. Look. Your photo's on the front page. What about us? Side-heroes never appear on the papers. So, Shiv. Your girlfriend must be really happy... ...to see your photo on the newspaper. With the police, or someone else. Dinner for everyone at my home on behalf of Shiv. That rascal Mahadev. I know he follows Guari's orders. He follows his instructions. If Mahadev works for Gauri... ...then why did he kill 12 of his men? They shook hands only after those killings. Shut up. Often we find faults with the enemy... ...to ignore our own faults. She's right. We'll have to change to take care of the entire department. What? - Strategy. You're asking me to take up Gauri's plan of action. No. No. I am asking you to make your own. If you change your style slightly... ...then it'll make a difference to the gang as well. Shut up, rascal. If the crow wants to be white like the swan... ...will he chafe himself on the ground? It'll peel your skin off. Why don't we kill those department people? Correct. You're absolutely right. Let's make those department people history. DK. If you try to make the police history... ...then you won't survive either. The world... I never miss. The underworld survives in this world... ...due to the mercy and greed of the police. If you kill a single police officer... ...then the entire department will come after you. You won't get a chance to breathe. Remember that. Understand. Never hurt the police. Understand? He was scared. Otherwise I would've killed him right there. Here. Bharti. Danaji. Pradhan. Sheik. Vedekar. I am Satya. - Hi. The most difficult job in the world is to kill someone. You're a doctor. You can understand that. Look. If someone's develops a gang-grin on his leg... ...then you amputate the part. The only difference is that... ...you do it on the operation table... ...and we do it out on the streets. Patients come to you. And we've to search for them. But in the end, our duty is the same. To protect people. I still remember... when Mahadev... ...came home after killing someone. I was feeling awful seeing the bloodstains on his shirt. But someone will have to get dirty... ...to clear the garbage of this city. And, Bharti, not everyone can do this. That's why Mahadev chose Shiv. By the way, it just occurred to me. Both their names mean the same. Lord Shankar. Let's just forget about this. Bharti, you and Shiv are a part of our family now. If you ever have a problem, tell me first. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thanks, Shiv. Thanks for what? I met Mahadev and Satya because of you. That's why. Fine. Shiv. We just received news that one of Sawatya's biggest goon... ...is coming to Tadka club. We'll have to go there in disguise. But, sir. What is his name? Some girl called Genie is his girlfriend. "All my ladies... yo step aside." "We're going to turn the heat up in this joint." "Coz we got a new girl in town." "Here's introducing..." "...the girl from overseas in local style." "Its Genie... genie... genie..." "Come out Genie." "Genie... genie... genie..." "Genie, you're defamed." "You're so fast, hit the brakes." "Dan Dan Dan Daai Daai Daai." "Dan Dan Dan Daai Daai Daai." "Look at me and blow a whistle." "Forget all the pain in your heart." "Shake your body." "Jump start this night." "Dan Dan Dan Daai Daai Daai." "Dan Dan Dan Daai Daai Daai." "Change the condition of your heart, take a shot." "Have dose of fun." "Stop racking your brains, put a lid on it." "Have dose of fun." "Stop racking your brains, put a lid on it." "You'll gel in with the world." "All the useless things will start making sense." "Let the beat heat you up." "It'll create an ambience." "Indulge your heart in some fun." "Dan Dan Dan Daai Daai Daai." "Dan Dan Dan Daai Daai Daai." "Embrace the darkness of the night." "Put your hands up." "This is how it should be." "Can you take this pressure now?" "Can you survive this pressure now?" "Change the crap boy." "What're you gonna do?" "Can you take this pressure now?" "Can you survive this pressure now?" "Change the crap boy." "What're you gonna do?" "Drinking, drinking, everybody sinking." "Drinking, drinking, everybody sinking." "Genie... genie... genie..." "Dan Dan Dan Daai Daai Daai." "Dan Dan Dan Daai Daai Daai." "Dan Dan Dan Daai Daai Daai." "Dan Dan Dan Daai Daai Daai." "Whatever it is, it feels less." "The world seems so slippery." "Whatever it is, it feels less." "The world seems so slippery." "Pour the gin out of the bottle." "Let the magic spread." "Treat your heart, give it neat." "Let the ambience change." "Why so scared, let it go." "Dan Dan Dan Daai Daai Daai." "Dan Dan Dan Daai Daai Daai." "There's the pot hanging, jump up and break it." "Catch it, catch it." "Dan Dan Dan Daai Daai Daai." "Dan Dan Dan Daai Daai Daai." "Dan Dan Dan Daai Daai Daai." "Dan Dan Dan Daai Daai Daai." Sawtya, the department is killing all our best shooters... ...and it doesn't mean that we don't do anything. Gauri gang will grow past us. I saw it on television today. The media is making us a joke. It this continues, then soon even the people will mock us. This is the right time. Let's kill them all. People salute miracle. And we've to show a miracle right now. And anyway, we're in the showbiz. The film and underworld business runs on publicity. I've been in this business for so long... ...but I never needed it. Publicity. It's the need of time. - Fine! In this business, I've always done as I will. But I feel that you'll have to pay dearly... ...for what you're going to do, remember that. But... this time I will listen to you. Thank you. - Fine. "The one with the might, has always been right." "With a gun in his hands, he runs the government." "The horse is always restless when it's tied." "Let it roam free and gallop around." "It stays restless all day." "My mind's short-tempered." "Hunger's shameless." "Yes, I'm twitchy." "Once more, let the scorecard go high. "One, two, three, four, five, six, seven." "Whoever I get my hands on, is done for good." "So you've no stature?" "Nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen." "Department. De... Department." "Department. De... Department." "All the files are in dust." "Court cases are a disease." "Just a bullet, that's all you need." "Put an end to this scuffle." "Jail, bail, known-unknown." "Cheating, deceit." "Cut the long story short." "So, why stretch it long." "My mind's short-tempered." "Hunger's shameless." "Yes, I'm twitchy." "Once more, let the scorecard go high. "One, two, three, four, five, six, seven." "Whoever I get my hands on, is done for good." "So you've no stature?" You got your publicity. I lost 15 of my men in one month. And the department is after us like hungry dogs. Rascal. In the Mahabharat, Lord Krishna said... ..."Only do your deed, and forget about the rest". I see. So, now you read the Gita as well along with the Koran? Actually, I've read the bible as well. Don't try to teach me. DK, how long will follow this woman's instructions? She'll get us killed, I am telling you. Now you're getting personal. If its personal then why bring her to the gang. How many times have I told you... ...I don't want girls in the gang! Hey. I am as good as any man. I've killed three of Shetty's men. Except for DK, can anyone else from your gang do that? No matter how difficult a job you gave me, but I was never sacred. This isn't right. Just because I am a woman, you think I am not equal. This isn't right. Be quiet. And you're instigating DK against me. I am instigating him? Me? - Yes. Me? Yes. Please. Sorry. He said sorry. He said sorry, didn't he? Forget it. I said sorry. Take care of her. We've been eradicating Sawatya gang members. But we completely forgot about Gauri. What could be the reason? Gauri gang is more organized than Sawatya... ...that's why they've survived so long. Can I ask a question? When you leave for work? I mean after killing someone... - Mother. Let her ask. I mean, can you do your normal chores... ...after killing someone? Can you sleep at nights? Aunt, I am just coming from an encounter. And I am sitting here, drinking tea... ...and asking for your daughter's hand in marriage. Shiv always had a feeling of patriotism in him... ...since he was a child. And killing criminals... I don't know how patriotic I am. All I know is that I do my job with conviction. I want to ask you a question. Can you... I mean, get yourself transferred in a nice, clean department. I am proud of my job. What are you doing, mother? - What? Shiv, come quickly. We've received news of... ...the assassination of Sarjay Rao Gaikwad. I'm coming. Sorry, something urgent has come up. What else? Must have to kill someone? Sarjay Rao Gaikwad. Earlier he used to work for a gangster. Then he killed his own boss and took his place. And suddenly, one day he joined politics. Some people say that he joined politics... ...for his personal interest. And he says that he did so to serve the people. Only the Lord knows the truth, or Sarjay Rao. But few people still believe that... ...there's no one more dangerous than him... ...not just in the underworld, but also in politics. What are you saying? How much are you willing to pay? You say it. You came to me. You must have a price in mind. 50. 50 crores. What is your name? Lalchand. - Lalchand. Lalchand. Sit. - No, no. No, its okay. - Sit. Look, Lalchand. The Lord has... When did you arrive? I am coming. What was I saying? Yes. The Lord has created everything invaluable in this world. We humans put a price on everything. When I used to run a gang... ...I never needed money. Do you know why? Because, anything I would set my sights on, would be mine. Then suddenly, I had the same experience... ...under the Dharavi signal which Gautam Buddh did... ...under the tree. Enlightenment. Enlightenment. Money is not everything in this world. You need the love of people, respect, honor. So, considering this the message for Lord... ...I left the underworld and joined politics. And became invaluable. 60 crores. 60 Cr. Cash. He didn't understand. Those who don't understand... ...I explain them in my style. And then they can't explain to anyone. Sorry, sorry, Sarjay Rao. I didn't mean that. My brother... Walchand... just get my brand name back from him anyhow. Please. PC... Call Walchand. Wal... Walchand. Sit. So what were you saying? What do you sell? Tobacco. You're saying it so proudly... ...as if you sell some ayurvedic paste. Pardon me, sir. Our tobacco sells more than the ayurvedic paste. We've a market of 500 cr. Indians have chewed tobacco worth 500 cr. What is the name of your tobacco? Sheila Tobacco. Out mother's name was Sheila. Actually, our father passed Sheila tobacco down to us. God bless the father who left tobacco for their sons in his will. Forget it. I will say just one thing. No more arguments after that. It'll be final. - Final. We're here to finalize it here. Lalchand, name your tobacco Sheila Mix. Thank you, thank you. And you, Walchand, call your tobacco, Shiela Remix. Shiela Remix. - Give each other a hug. At least do it for your mother, Sheila. Come on. What did you say was Sheila's market? 500 cr. PC. Take 60 cr each for the party fund. What? - What? 60 cr. That's my service tax. Calm down. Listen. Listen. Listen. Look. I don't believe in either Gandhi or Godse. I believe in getting rid of poverty. The biggest crime in this country, is being poor. And all you poor people are criminals. Criminals. Even after the country's independence... ...you cannot see the noose of poverty around your necks. You're smiling. I curse you. There are many leaders here... ...who are filling their own pockets. And emptying yours. You can see their huge buildings... ...at every road, every crossroads... ...under the pretext of computer and social justice. You will only find crows there, and no one else. In democracy, those huge buildings... ...that are constructed in Delhi, with your money... ...what's the purpose of it? Nothing at all. I, Sarjay Rao... For the dry and barren lands of the farmers... How dare you attack from the back? Face me. Face me. I will show you. I will show you who is Sarjay Rao. Leave me. No, sir. Thank you. Take it. Don't think that you saved my life. You don't know my history. My body has more stitches, then skin. A 1 A, A1/2 bullet can't kill me. One needs a missile to kill me. Missile. Do you know why I was attacked? No, sir. Because the Lord wanted us to meet. Sir, I suspect that Gauri put a contract on you. Who's in your family? - I'm all alone. No, get married. Do you have a house? - No, sir. Without a house in Mumbai... ...no sensible father will let you marry his daughter. PC. Give him a flat. - Sir. No, sir. I am giving it. But, that's... - It's not a bribe. It's not a bribe. A bribe's giving for illegal things. I do legal things illegally. I never do things illegal things, legally. There's a difference between the two. You won't understand. The government notices a capable police officer... ...only after he's dead. My style is different. Different style. You saved my life for the sake of the country. So, I am gifting you a flat, on behalf of the government. Your name, Shiv Narayan. It's a nice name. Shiva, Narayan. Its catchy. Illegally legal, and legally illegally... ...do you know the difference between the two? No, sir? Nothing. It was just a joke. Illegally legal, and legally illegally... ...do you know the difference between the two, sir? Illegally legal, and legally illegally? What is it? It's a joke, by Sarjay Rao. Sarjay Rao. He's giving you a flat, and you're happy. He's giving it to you from the government quota... ...not from his pocket. So, no need to be indebted to him. That's not it, sir. So? Say it. No matter what the people say about him... ...but I believe that he's a clean man. It's everyone viewpoint, Shiv. You're happy, aren't you? So I am happy. I'm in a good mood today. I feel like drinking the entire night. Now that you get married, then we'll have to stop all this. What, sir? Come on, let me show you. "O bartender." "With this empty glass." "I am here to..." "...drink from your eyes." "Raise your eye-brows." "Let me drink from your eyes." "Right here, in your jamboree." "Come in my arms." "Your beloved's crazy about you." "I've drunk only a little." "But I haven't done anything wrong." "I've drunk only a little." "But I haven't done anything wrong." "O Julie, O Sheela, O Raano, someone stop me." "Someone better hold me." "Or I might fall down." "I've drunk only a little." "But I haven't done anything wrong." "Don't compare the heart with wealth." "Love is not a deal." "It can severe relation." "Shatter hearts." "There are so many sweet dreams in these eyes." "Right here in this jamboree." "Come in my arms." "Your beloved's crazy about you." "I've drunk only a little." "But I haven't done anything wrong." "I've drunk only a little." "But I haven't done anything wrong." "O Julie, O Sheela, O Raano, someone stop me." "Someone better hold me." "Or I might fall down." "I've drunk only a little." "But I haven't done anything wrong." "I've drunk only a little." "But I haven't done anything wrong." But whose flat is this? The government has kept a reserved quota... ...for capable officers. And Sarjay Rao has approved this for me. Sarjay Rao, minister? We give free treatment in our hospital to the poor with his donation. But how does he know you? Sarjay Rao, we were just talking about you. I hope, you were saying something nice. My fiancA?A? really likes the flat that you gave me, sir. FiancA?e.? - Yes, sir. Name's Bharti. Let me talk to him. One second, sir. Hello, sir. This is Dr. Bharti. Thank you so very much. Thanks for what? What do you mean? You gave Shiv this flat. And you're the first guest I'm inviting to our marriage. I see. Then I will give you the first gift. Yes. And I will accept the gift only from you. So you have to attend the marriage. Who wants to die by not listening to the doctor? I will surely come. Thank you so much, sir. Okay, sir. I am coming right away. Shiv. Sir. Hi. Hi. Welcome home, sir. Congratulations. - Thank you. So, now you've a home. Mahadev, now you go and talk to Bharti's parents... ...about their marriage. Shiv doesn't know how to. Bharti told me everything. I was just answering their questions. Answering their questions or giving them a heart attack? Hello. Where is your boss? My boss? - Yes. Bhonsle. Tell him to come and meet me. And you too. - Yes. Sir. Sir, Sarjay Rao has called you. - Why? I don't know. He just asked you to come immediately. Nice shoes. They're imported, sir. They'll look better if you keep them outside. What's up with Bajaj? Who Bajaj, sir? Builder Bajaj. Maybe not you, but your... boss knows. Your boss. That's with less sugar. And he has a sweet tooth. A bit too sweet. Your friend is threatening my builder friend. Friend? Gauri. Mohammad Gauri. Your boss knows what I'm saying. He knows. He knows. Tell your boss... to tell Gauri... ...to call... my friend by 5 o'clock today evening... ...and apologise, otherwise... I won't even call. Sir. Sir, what was that? Will you have tea? What do you think? The difference between Sarjay Rao and Gauri. Sir, how can you compare those two? You are right. Sarjay Rao is much more treacherous than Gauri. Just like you said. You're tired of trying to decide what's right and what's wrong. So why are you doing it today? Sarjay Rao gave you a flat, so he's nice. He said Bajaj's a nice man, so he's a nice man. I know both of them really well. Better than you. Shiv, people aren't good or bad. They are either intelligent or fools. No one's right or wrong. We pick what's right or wrong. You chose Sarjay Rao, and I chose Gauri. And only time will tell who is right and who is wrong. Everyone in this world gets a position. Sarjay Rao got the position of a minister. Bajaj, as a builder. Gauri, as the don. And us, as police officer. We should all take advantage of our position... ...and become someone. If you understand, then you'll be rolling in money. And you can never imagine, how much. I found out something about someone very close to me. Who? - Someone... I respect a lot. And today I found out he's not what I thought he was. Then how can you respect someone like that? Bharti, there's right and wrong in every person. And it's wrong to ignore the right, for his wrong. What happened suddenly? I am not right either, that I can find faults in others. I work for a department which is illegal. And for that I killed many people. It can be right according to me. But what about other's views. How can you link these two things, Shiv? The difference between right and wrong... ...is like a dead and a living person. Knowing what's right and wrong, makes you the right man. It's not about my thinking, it's about misconceptions. Whatever. I suggest, that you talk to brother Mahadev about this. I am sure no one can explain you better than him. You are right. Sir, I made it this far today all because of you. My position, my fame, my house. I got it all because of you. Whatever you said is absolutely right. But I still can't support you. But I will never cross your path either. You think I am right, and my path is wrong. No, sir. Until you don't tread on my path... ...how will you know whether its right or wrong. First ask yourself who you're working for, Shiv. The society or the system. It won't make a difference to them. What do you think... ...after eradicating the underworld... ...there won't be anyone else to take its place? There's no guarantee to that, Shiv. This is a never-ending cycle. Nothing in this world ever ends. Sir, like I said... you're absolutely right. But I can't do this. I am not with you on just this matter. But I am also not against you. Shiv, we're two wheels of the same car. If we tread together, we can avert accidents. No, sir. We won't. And that's because, the respect I have for you... ...is higher than my thinking. Fine, Shiv. You're saying this with such conviction... Even I feel there won't be any problem between us. Guari's shooters have attacked us thrice... ...in the last one week. And what are we doing? Drinking alcohol. Just once... Just once if Sawatya says yes... ...then these shooters... You'll always be waiting for Sawatya's yes or no. So? What can I do? Sawatya's not allowing me to teach that Bhairon a lesson. And here, you're making a mess of my mood. I know... if I ask Sawatya he'll surely say no. He'll say no if you ask. And look, baby. How long are going to work for Sawatya? What do you get from the amount of risk that you take? Nothing. You should get a share in the profit. Sawatya will surely give you. Because he knows... ...that he cannot run the gang without you. Ask him. How much should I ask for? 50. He'll surely give you 35. Of course. I brought him from the streets. I thought him the job. Fed him. And today he's asking me for a share. Says he's the most important man in the gang. Says, we cannot do without him. That vixen has instigated him. I told him she'll get us killed one day. If you want, I can kill DK and Nasir. No. DK is very popular in the gang. If we kill him, there can be a problem. But if we give a tip to Mahadev... ...then we can shed few tears as well. Right? You're so cunning. Mind. How did you come here? We got a tip. I never imagined that I'll die so easily. No. No. She's no gangster. I brought her in the gang forcefully. She never did anything. You... you can kill me if you want. But spare her. She's no gangster. Why are you lying? We'll die together if we have to. Quiet. You're a woman. Sir won't harm a woman. Again the same thing. I more of a man than you are. We'll die together if we have to. Quiet. Absolutely quiet. I am talking to him. There's much you have to do. Why don't you understand? What will I do without you? Are you crazy... Stop your love story, and listen to my story. I want to start a new gang with you two... ...which will work against Sawatya. And anyway, Sawatya gave me the tip about you two. Now stop this old story, and think about the new one. But what about this new gang. And what's your interest in it? Don't rack your mind thinking about it. Think about your own interest. But why us? Because you two don't have a better option. And I you two are the best option I have. Gauri. There are two advantages in making DK gang. First, your name won't be dragged in small matters. And secondly, Sawatya will be pressurized from both sides. Who is it? - Gauri. Give it to me. Hello. Yes, brother Gauri. Yes, I am fine. How are you? Yes, Rinku's fine as well. Of course. I will. Gauri, we'll kill DK as soon as our job's done. Okay? You're so selfish. Satya, the world's selfish. We should get our interest fulfilled... ...before your opponent does. Baby. - Yes. Just like Mahadev sir, said... ...we should make a brand of our gang... ...to rule Mumbai. And to make a brand name, we'll have to release a big film. Whose? No picture's complete without a financer. Sawatya's main financer is Patel. Why don't we target him? You know something, baby. Our team... is superhit. I am king of the Mumbai. And you're my queen. You can never prove Bhosle's link with Gauri. Accusing a well known officer of the department... ...without evidence, meaning crucifying the government. It won't be right. To make me the Home minister... The biggest scoundrel created by the Lord... DK. So it's my personal responsibility... ...to reward him. Send DK on a lifelong holiday package. On my behalf. Lifelong package. This morning, Shiv Narayan shot DK's shooter... ...Karan Rastogi, and he died on the spot. This morning, Shiv Narayan shot DK gang's Durga Prasad. Shiv Narayan shot famous hotelier Francis Pereira... ...who had links with DK gang. In incidents that occurred in different places... ...Shiv Narayan shot Ramesh Tunda, Salim Kalia... ...Kishore Kurla and Malwani. And according to sources... ...Shiv Narayan can reach to DK himself. You don't understand. If we don't kill Shiv Narayan... ...then all our gang members will flee for good. We mean by whoever is left. He has already eradicated half of our gang. I didn't start a gang to hide like cowards. Either you let me kill him, or you kill me. Here. Kill me. Kill me. - Calm down. Calm. We were tired of hearing the same thing from Sawatya. And now you. If we wanted to be calm, we could've... ...continued working for him. Look, if we don't kill that rascal Shiv Narayan... ...then our gang will be over. I never stopped you from killing Shiv Narayan. But before killing him we'll have to snatch his fame. Why are you talking in riddles? If we kill him, it'll be the end of his fame as well. You can kill fame only with defame, and not bullets. We've to kill Shiv Narayan at the right time... ...then no one will question us. Neither the department, nor the media. Nor Sarjay Rao. Baby. Mahadev sir is right. Mahadev, you haven't arrived yet. We had invited Shiv and Bharti for dinner. Did you forget? - No. I remember. I am coming. Its okay, Shiv. So what if DK survived. We'll see how long he can survive. - Yes, sir. The food's getting cold. Shall we, sir? I've heard that Sawatya's out for your blood. Take it seriously, Shiv. And be careful. What is the meaning of careful in our profession, sir? As long as we're alive, we're alive. Or we don't. Shiv. You mean more than a brother to me. Even I've a responsibility of finishing your enemies. Together we'll kill Sawatya. Sir. Are you coming or shall I throw the food out? Shiv. We should take advantage of DK and Sawatya's enmity. If you two don't stop talking about your work... ...then I'll start talking about my operations. And I'll start talking about my recipes. Right? Don't be so cruel with us, please.

There are many advantages of drinking. What is that, sir? Firstly, after drinking you don't mind... ...what one says, whether you or me. What happened, sir? What happened, sir? Tell me. Sir? What is wrong, sir? I just remembered something. An old joke. What joke, sir? It's private. Sir, if you don't mind, can I ask you something? Look here, look. Nothing personal. I get a little sentimental. Why do you wear this bell? Bell? Bell. At Dharavi signal, when I had the enlightenment... ...He also gave me this bell. And I took it as his blessing. And tied it to my wrist. Whenever this bell rings... ...it reminds me that, for the sake of the country... ...I need to... - Eradicate every criminal. And... and as long as this rings I will... Keep killing them. - Exact. Correct. What happened? - Nothing. It's private. Private? I am your wife. What's private between us. Not me, someone else. - Shiv. Danaji, you looked worried. What's wrong? - It's private. Oh no. Again private. What's private between us? What happened? There's a builder, Thakur. There's a property dispute... ...between Thakur builder and Mirchandani. Thakur has threatened Mirchandani... ...using Sawatya's name. That he'll use him to kill him. Mirchandani wants to make a welfare home on that plot. But now he's scared. Because he's scared of Sawatya. You can get in touch with the architect... ...and call me as soon as possible. Say, by today evening. Right, sir. It will be done. I'll give you all the information by evening. - Cool. Thakur. And, who are you? I am Shiv Narayan. Police. I need to talk to you. Come on, come on. Sit inside. What do you want? Which police station are you from? Where are you taking me? Why did you bring me here? Tell me. Listen to me carefully. If Sawatya kills Mirchandani, then I will kill you. Tell that to Sawatya. Come on. Walk back from here. You'll get some exercise. Bye, Thakur. Famous builder Thakur has been missing since morning. Thakur's people are saying that... ...two police officers abducted Thakur today morning. But the most sensational and amazing fact is... ...that one of them was encounter king Shiv Narayan. Sir, what am I hearing about Thakur. He's been found. Dead. But who killed him? They say it's you. - What? Tell me, why will Shiv Narayan kill Thakur. The investigation suggests... ...that Mirchandani gave a contract to Shiv Narayan... ...to kill Thakur. No, that's just an accusation. No, sir it's not just an accusation. We've a witness. Who? Danaji. He's close to Shiv Narayan. He was with him when he killed Thakur. He saw everything with his own eyes, sir. Shiv Narayan killed Thakur right before my eyes. I tried to stop me. But he didn't listen to me. Now, even my life's in danger. You know better than me, sir. No one in this world is honest. Not even your Shiv Narayan. He has betrayed you, and the department as well. The other day when you were talking about the sweet tooth. That was Shiv Narayan, not me. I knew that Shiv had a connection with some gang. But the other day when you were accusing me... ...I didn't say this because you wouldn't have listened to me. Bhonsle. Just like you said. No one's honest. Whether you know that more or me, only time will tell. And the time you took for saying this dialogue... ...act faster in arresting Shiv Narayan. Bharti, forget about arresting him. No one can even touch Shiv as long as Mahadev is there. Brother Mahadev, what's wrong with Danaji? Why is he lying? I'm here to arrest Shiv. Shiv... What? Mahadev, what are you saying? - Satya. I can't disobey orders. Mahadev, it's obvious. It's a conspiracy. I know. You know, but still. You know what Shiv did for the department... ...so how can the department do this with Shiv? Believe me, Bharti. I am much more shocked than you are. Shiv is more than a brother to me. Don't forget, I am the one who brought him in the department. And I terribly regret this. Talk to Sarjay Rao. I will call him. These orders are from Sarjay Rao. To arrest him. Sir. Whatever I did, I did it for the department. Even I am doing it for the department, Shiv. Take care. Shiv. Shiv. Satya, please. - Bharti. Shiv. Shiv. Satya, please let me go. He's not done anything. Shiv. I'll try my best to relieve Shiv from this problem. You know that he's innocent, but yet... Who said that innocent don't get punished? Shiv. Catch him. Shiv. Stop. Stop. Shiv. Stop. Vedekar, catch him. What could I do, Shiv? What could I do? Someone kidnapped my son from school... ...and threatened me that if I don't accuse you... ...then they'll slit his throat. They'll kill him. Forgive me, Shiv. I still don't know where my son is. What has the world come to? The department doesn't know where their officers are. What will happen to our country? DK, if the department really wants to catch someone... ...then no one can escape. The department doesn't want to catch Shiv. That's why, we'll need you two to lure him out in the open. One needs to play the lyre to get the snake out of its burrow. But I only know to press the trigger. Kill Shiv before he kills you two. Maybe you've been instigated. Take my advice. Surrender yourself. It'll be in the interest government, department, me and you. No, sir. Please believe me. I am innocent. And no one can prove that except for me. What do you think? Who wants to instigate me? Surely it's Sawatya. It has to be him. Shiv Narayan. Recognized me? It's Sawatya. You killed 22 of my men, but did I ever say anything? I didn't. Actually, I completely respect a person... ...who does his duty honestly. I am very happy. Really. But do you see. Do you see this mess? Your own department is out for your blood. What about that? Nothing. That's exactly what happens. Now listen to me. Actually, there's a vacancy for a shooter in my gang. DK's left me. So I need a man like you. Really? Will you join hands with me? Yes. Your style of "Yes", I really like that, son. Really. Come and meet me. I never imagined... that we'll meet like this. I always thought we'll meet only during the final rites. I am very happy... that you thought of joining me. I just want to kill DK. - Why? Because he killed Thakur and got me in this mess. I've sure information about DK but no weapon. In our profession, you don't kill a man with a weapon... ...but with information. Now you work for Sawatya. You'll get everything you need. Why do you trust me so much? Not you, but your situation. I know... that you know. I am your only option. Misconception is bad thing. Stop. I work for Sarjay Rao. Sarjay Rao. Sarjay Rao. Sarjay Rao. Talk to him. Sir, talk to Shiv Narayan. He wants to kill me. And tell him. Here. Talk to him. Shiv Narayan. Sawatya works for me. I'll tell you everything. Look, sir. If we can't find Shiv Narayan... ...then we'll have to do something... ...so that he comes to us. I have an idea. What? Abduct Shiv Narayan's wife. Don't you dare think like that? We've an unwritten contract between us. We never involve families in personal disputes. Mahadev sir, is right. DK, we won't act on your plan. We'll find Shiv Narayan, but with honesty. Think of a different way. To hell with him. Now when I have a plan he's talking about family. If I hadn't involved the family... ...then this saga would've never begun. Baby. You are absolutely right. No one's honest or corrupt in this world. They're either intelligent or stupid. And he knows the difference. Mahadev sir helped us for his own interest. And he can befriend Shiv Narayan again... ...for any of his other interest. And our gang will be in trouble. We'll abduct Bharti without informing him. You're right. In this world, everyone's trying to make fool of each other. Just watch, as soon as Shiv Narayan's dead... ...we'll be the only option he'll have. Wow, these days you're using your brains as well. Hello. Shiv sir has been shot. - What? Hello, sister-in-law. Mahadev sir has sent us. I am inspector Nasir, and this is inspector DK. I mean, Dhanush Kumari. Bharti, Sawatya has shot Shiv Narayan. He's breathing his last. Are you crazy? Have you lost your mind? Is this how you give such a bad news? Who else will we say it to? She's a doctor. But where is he? Here. Right here. Where is he? Sawatya, doesn't just work for me... ...but also the government. What? Government has made a deal with Sawatya. - I didn't get it. Look. Even you know that these days... ...the Gauri is not just a underworld Don, but a terrorist. Sawatya's power... Sawatya's power is slowly decreasing in Mumbai. The government has made a deal with Sawatya... ...to put a stop on the increasing power of the underworld. So that the balance of power remains even. We want to support Sawatya... ...in finishing Gauri's power. Consider that, just like we started... ...the department for you in the police force. Similarly, we've opened another department... ...in the underworld. Which is being run by Sawatya. Your both have the same motive. Not different. So, when our department was killing Sawatya's men... ...why didn't you stop us? Come here. Our deal was with Sawatya, not with his gang members. Sawatya's gang members didn't know about this deal. That's why, when you kill his gang members, you do the right thing. Sir, I don't understand what's right and what's wrong? Right and wrong is only the situation. Sir, this will make me go crazy. Abhimanyu couldn't come out of the quagmire... ...because he didn't hear the entire thing. Forget it. We'll talk when we've the time. Right now, you just have to join hands with Sawatya... ...and finish Gauri. And today, in place of Mohammad Gauri... ...its your boss, Mahadev Rao Bhosle. Your boss... is the real boss of DK gang. And they just kidnapped your wife. Hello. Sir, this is Shiv Narayan. Sir, I made a mistake thinking your way was wrong. I was not in my senses to reject your offer. And now Bharti's life is in danger. What's wrong with Bharti? I've received news that DK has kidnapped Bharti. 'Abduct Shiv Narayan's wife.' How do you know that DK kidnapped her? Because I've caught Sawatya... ...and right now he's in my custody. So, if its not Sawatya... ...then it must be DK. I'll meet you near the Chiploon road bridge... ...and handover Sawatya to you. You can kill him and tell the entire world that I caught him... ...then all the allegations against me will be removed. And then I'll return to the department... ...and... work only for you. Okay, Shiv. After that we'll go and save Bharti. Yes, sir. I don't want that... The entire department is defamed... ...for a single corrupt officer like Mahadev. Officers will come and go. But the department will always exist. It is our responsibility to... ...maintain the honor and pride of the department. And if you've to do something illegal for it... ...then that's right as well. Sorry, sister-in-law. Your brother-in-law has made a mistake. Forgive me. Please. After today we won't give you a chance to complain. Really. Can I say something? When you smile... ...you'll look exactly like the sister-in-law in... ...'Hum Aapke Hain Kaun'. Call up Shiv Narayan and ask him to come here... ...otherwise I will kill you right here. Who is it? Who killed them? That scoundrel. Must be Sawatya. Sawatya. Sawatya, face me if you can. Come and... - DK. My gun is aimed at your head. Throw down your guns. Or else I will shoot you. I will count to three. Three. You? - I can kill you two if I want. But after what you two did with me... ...I will beat you two to death. Rascal. Baby. What happened to you? No, no, you're fine. Nothing's wrong with you? Get up. Have you lost confidence in me? Get up. Shiv. Shiv. Shiv, are you fine? What is this insolence? No, sir. I just came to my senses. I even told you, that we're the wheels of the same car. If we stay together, we'll never meet with an accident. Didn't I tell you that? Even after I did all that, you stayed loyal to Sarjay Rao. You never thought how I would feel. Sir, I am only loyal to the department and no one else. And you're not even loyal to yourself. I ignored my conscience and treated on your path... ...but you got my wife abducted. I never imagined that you would stoop so low. Forget it, Shiva. You'll understand this some other day. Shiv. Whether you believe it or not... ...but I always loved you more than a brother. There's one thing, Shiv. Look after Satya and Rinku, if you can. They'll be completely alone without me. Completely alone, Shiv. Shiv Narayan didn't kill Thakur, DK did. Danaji intentionally testified against him... ...so that we can get Shiv Narayan undercover... ...and then finish... This plan was Mahadev Bhosle's. Mahadev Bhosle killed DK. Unfortunately, in this operation he didn't survive. The department will always miss Mahadev sir. Because I don't have the capability... ...to do the job that he used to. But I will try to complete the job... ...that Mahadev sir has left incomplete. Sarjay Rao. How was your personal experience with Mahadev Rao. First time when I met that man... So? I knew his ability at first sight. Mahadev Bhosle is an example. Shiv. - Yes. This is Gauri. Mohammad Gauri. You look like Mahadev, now that he's no more... ...you can take his place. You'll get enough money. We'll meet soon.
