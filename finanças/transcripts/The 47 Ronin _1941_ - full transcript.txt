Lord Asano was ordered to commit harakiri and his domain was confiscated, while Lord Kira received no chastisement whatsoever. The news sent a shock through Lord Asano's ranks, but Senior Counselor Kuranosuke Oishi calmly considered their options and settled on a course of action. Vowing to avenge Lord Asano another day, the retainers relinquished Ako Castle. Kuranosuke's pretext for yielding up the castle was to petition the shogunate for restoration of the Asano house. Contrary to his true intentions, the petition gained wide support. If the petition were to be granted, it would erase all justification for revenge in the public eye. As spring came a year later, Kuranosuke agonized over his predicament. AT THE EDO RESIDENCE OF MIDDLE COUNCILLOR TSUNATOYO TOKUGAWA Regent Konoe in Kyoto wishes to persuade Kuranosuke to enter his service. He has sent a messenger requesting that I approach the shogun regarding restoration of the Asano house. But I hear that former Asano retainers led by this same Kuranosuke are plotting to raid Lord Kira's residence and kill him. Indeed, I have heard the same. If I take this request to the shogun, the Asano house will surely be restored. But that only makes me hesitate all the more. The Chinese sages teach us that filial duty begins with honoring our ancestors. But as presumptuous as it may sound, I believe there are times when one must step beyond the sages. Please go on. In my lectures to you on Japanese history, I've tried to cover the points one must keep in mind. We are not Chinese. Before blindly accepting the teachings of the sages, we must always remember that we are Japanese samurai. Well said. That is exactly right. In all things, the samurai spirit must come first. Only then must one follow the sages. If the shogun approves the restoration of the Asano house, it will make revenge impossible. In the eye of public opinion, justification for revenge will be gone. What is it? The messenger from Lord Konoe, your father-in-law, has come to pay his respects before departing for Kyoto. May I at least tell him that you have agreed to approach the shogun regarding the request he brought? Without some such - No. I am still considering the matter. Suke'emon. So that's the master of this house? I'd heard he was quite the scholar, and I can see he's no ordinary rat - I mean, lord. Now, Suke'emon. At your pleading, I arranged for you to come, even though I'm new to this house. But today's noh performances are a very important occasion. You must be on your best behavior. I know. This way? Come forward. You used to serve in Lord Asano's household, didn't you? Who was the man with you in the garden? My brother, Suke'emon Tominomori, whom I received permission to invite for today's performances. Your brother? One of the ronin from Ako wished to see our noh? Is he aware that Lord Kira will be coming for today's performance? I'm told your name is Suke'emon Tominomori. What was your status in the Asano house? I was a man of no account, receiving but a pittance. Is that right? Did they call 200 koku a pittance and a samurai who carried the lord's missives to other daimyo a man of no account? You are too far away. Come closer. Take a cup. If you have no special business with me, I beg to be excused. Never mind, then. But the man from Honjo you wish to glimpse will not be arriving for quite some time yet. Will you still not come closer and accept a cup? I think not. Sake offered by grand daimyo in stiff settings does not particularly delight the palate. Very interesting. A man who speaks his mind. Keep your distance if you wish, but stay and talk with me awhile. Suke, you're wrong to think that wretched rat Kira will linger in the sewers of Honjo forever. There's no telling when he could escape 245 miles away to Yonezawa. As father of Tsunanori Uesugi, lord of the 150,000-koku Yonezawa domain, he could retire to his son's castle and the protection of his retainers. It wouldn't be long before he died a natural death. You may grind your teeth and glare at Yonezawa Castle, but it will be too late. This is your house. You may say whatever you please. Well, well. Even this Oishi fellow in Yamashina must find you a handful. I suppose you're thinking, "Say what you want. You just watch." But from where I stand, even Oishi, sad to say, has made one terrible blunder. Oishi is Oishi, and we are us. I understand Oishi has changed since last year. The debauchery I hear of can reflect no ordinary change. Whatever it reflects, it is taking place. So if Kuranosuke has had a change of heart, does that mean the rest of you will abandon your loyalty too? I don't suppose a man of your station knows of such things, but in the kitchen they use something called a tub, which is held together by a hoop. If that hoop breaks, the sides fall apart. No one can scoop up water with one flat piece of wood. Suke'emon, if you and your fellow ronin have a secret purpose, you should not think of it as purely private. For you to achieve your aim would be for hundreds of thousands of samurai across the land to achieve it. I do not wish to stand in your way. To do so would be to lose my way as a samurai. To lend one's own samurai spirit to support another's - that is the true and sympathetic spirit of the samurai. Idle people may entertain all manner of idle thoughts. Suke'emon, I do not inquire out of passing whimsy. We are now in the 15th year of Genroku, and the spirit of the samurai is in sad retreat. Even if it means begging you with bowed head, I want to know you indeed have a plan. I know you're determined to say nothing and that I ask the impossible in pressing you to tell me. Look me in the eye, Suke'emon. As a loyal servant of this great land of ours, I want to believe in you. Then if I may, I'd like to ask you this. I've heard the present shogun is a very suspicious man who dislikes daimyo houses of good reputation. Of the 20-some lords whose houses have been abolished, not one had sullied his name with womanizing or other bad behavior. Every one of them was well respected by his peers. When my master, Lord Asano, drew his sword at the castle, I believe you were in attendance, and you must have known the decision handed down was unfair. My master was ordered to commit harakiri and his lands were confiscated, while his adversary Kira received no chastisement at all. When you turned a blind eye to that, was it from fearing the displeasure of the shogun, who might deem any meddling to be a grab for power? Suke'emon, you mustn't - No, wait. Let's hear the rest, Suke'emon. On that occasion, if you who are a direct descendant of Lord Ieyasu had spoken but one word, my master surely would not have had to die the way he did. And yet... and yet... you preach to me and my brothers of the samurai spirit? It is a little too convenient, and the kind of favor we can do without. Right. An entirely understandable response. I will press you no further. Supposing you did have a secret scheme in the works, you wouldn't want to admit it. And, quite as you say, I am in no position to ask. But that still leaves the problem of Regent Konoe's request. He says he wishes to take Kuranosuke into his service and wishes me to approach the shogun about restoring the Asano house. His messenger was here again even today. And Suke, restoring the Asano house was originally Oishi's own request. If it is granted, then no matter how you may feel, revenge against Kira will be impossible. My lord! My lord! For you to request restoration of the Asano house on the one hand, while pursuing revenge on the other, is not justifiable to the world at large. What do you intend to do about restoring the Asano house? I'll be going to the castle tomorrow, and I intend to speak to the shogun. I beg you, my lord! I beg you, my lord! Lord Kira has arrived. Go forth to receive him. No, Suke'emon! Have you gone mad? Let go! If Lord Tsunatoyo goes to the castle tomorrow, today is our last chance! You can't stain this house with blood now! There must be a better way! If I don't do it now, Kira will die a natural death! Kiyo! You too have prior obligations to the Asano house! Don't stop me! I'll help you! I'll lead you to him so you can kill him. In tonight's noh, Lord Kira will perform as Tomomori in Benkei on the Boat. I'll lead you to him then. - Insolence! - My lord! Please let me go! Did you think I was Kira, you fool? Where would it leave Oishi and the others if you killed Kira now? Please let me go, or I'll be forced to take you - What? I don't care who you are! I will not spare - Have you lost your head, Suke'emon? To slice Kira up - is that all you want? Is simply offering Kira's severed head at Lord Asano's grave enough to avenge your master's death? Why? Do you not wish, even if you ultimately fail to kill Kira, to carry out a plan of vengeance for which you need have no pangs of conscience or regret? While the right hand seeks to restore the Asano house, the left hand attempts to cut Kira down. You are trifling with just cause and misreading public sympathies. Don't you understand that? Kuranosuke does. Having impulsively asked for the Asano house to be restored... he hides his true feelings as he goes one day to Shimabara, the next to Gion... to drink bitter and torturous sake. The torments of his heart... the sadness of his heart - You ignorant fools haven't the first idea what he's going through. Suke'emon, even if Kira ultimately lives out his allotted span... and dies a peaceful death, if you and your fellow ronin conduct yourselves with prudence... and with good judgment, never betraying the nobility of your cause, then what more would you gain by taking his gray head? Indeed, if you would seek revenge as men of virtue, then your every step until you strike Kira must accord with duty and fidelity. That is the path to a truly worthy revenge. Suke'emon, would you cast these principles aside? Would you deprive Kuranosuke and your fellows of dying honorably as men of virtue? It was wrong of me. That's the cue for Tomomori. Counselor! The decision has come! And it's excellent news! These two have come from Edo with the word we've been waiting for. Counselor, the appeal regarding our lord's brother, Daigaku - Wait. Let's go inside. Now, tell me your news. Allow me to omit the usual formalities. Our lord's brother is released from the strict house arrest he's been under since last March. His lands of 3,000 koku are to be confiscated, and he's placed in the custody of the main branch of the Asano house in Hiroshima. I see. So Master Daigaku is to be under confinement? He's to be in the custody of the main Asano family in Hiroshima? I see. Counselor, all the torments you have suffered until now... can be put to rest. No doubt you've all thought that my recent behavior was quite reprehensible - indeed, unspeakably outrageous. Although it seemed necessary at the time, petitioning to restore the Asano house under Master Daigaku was the worst mistake of my life - an ill-considered decision that could not be undone. Perish the thought, but had the house been restored under Master Daigaku... with a small fief of some 20,000 koku, then no matter how we might fret and gnash our teeth, in the public perception we would no longer have been justified in attacking Kira's residence to avenge our lord. Even slitting my belly before our lord's grave at Sengaku Temple could not have adequately atoned for my error. I was in anguish. It has been a painful burden - until today. Counselor... now we can finally avenge our lord. Yes. We will now seek out our enemy Yoshinaka Kira. Even with the 150,000-koku Uesugi house standing behind him, we need have no fear. I want you two to return to Edo at once and inform our brothers there that I will be arriving shortly. THE 15TH YEAR OF GENROKU (1702), DECEMBER 14 LADY ASANO'S RESIDENCE IN AKASAKA, EDO This is the day your husband died. Must they make such a commotion? Even if they're of no relation, must they be so inconsiderate? They're young and excited about the coming new year, especially after the end-of-year housecleaning yesterday. I just need to concentrate on praying for my husband's soul. You came to Edo from Ako to serve in the Teppozu residence, didn't you? Yes. We hope your journey went well, so near the end of the year. Your conscientious service is much appreciated. Is your mistress well? Yes. She will be delighted to see you. Godayu, please inform our lady. Kuranosuke Oishi, former senior counselor at the castle in Ako, has come to Edo and wishes to see her. - Ochiai. - Yes? As counselor in charge of household affairs, do you think it wise? He has come expressly to see her. I see no reason to deny him. Please announce him. - This will not do! Ochiai, I needn't remind you that Lord Asano's disturbance at the castle last March has reflected very badly not only on Lady Asano's own family, but on the main branch of the Asano house in Hiroshima, and on other relatives as well, causing them all a great deal of distress. Some bannermen among them were even relieved of their posts. No, no! Do not announce him! If the former Asano retainers were to attack Lord Kira, there's no foretelling the possible consequences for this house owing to Lady Asano's connection. With restoration of the house no longer a possibility, it's beyond me why he would choose to journey here to Edo so close to the end of the year. What if receiving him incurs the displeasure of the shogunate? Perhaps you make light of such things because you served your mistress in the Asano house as well, but as representative of her own family, I cannot allow this visitor to be announced. Ochiai, where is Kuranosuke? Right in there. Our mistress would like to see him. I do not advise it, Lady Toda. Our mistress is on her way. It's so good to see you. You're too far away. Come closer. With me in Edo and you in the domain, it's been a very long time since we last met. Has it been three years? You look well, and unchanged. Or so I would like to say, but in fact everything has changed. I wish to convey to you my deepest sympathies. It has been difficult for you as well since the incident. You look a little haggard. Have some sake, Kuranosuke. You've come through the snow. You must warm yourself. I'm much obliged. Have another. Perhaps you've heard I'm fond of sake, but no, thank you. A little snack, then, to whet your appetite for a successful revenge. Ouch! You strike where it hurts. Since you've braved even the snow to come to Edo, your purpose must be of no ordinary importance. There is nothing quite so wretched as a samurai who's become masterless. Only a handful manage to make a living. The rest barely scrape by, shadows of their former selves, hardly able to keep their wives and children alive. They approach me with their various demands - "Take up arms!" they cry, or "Seek vindication!" And having once been the senior counselor who spoke for our lord, I could not ignore them. I've hastened to Edo to find those hot-blooded ones who insist now is the time to press the attack. Rather than starve to death unnoticed, they wish to die sensationally attempting revenge and be on everyone's lips - a sad motivation, I'm afraid. Kuranosuke. It's not a woman's place to meddle... but I've heard Lord Kira plans to retire to Yonezawa Castle in the domain of his son, Lord Uesugi, when the snow melts in the spring. I have heard the same. I believe the Kira household fears what we might do and is considering all manner of stratagems. Is it your intention, Counselor, to allow Lord Kira to go peacefully into retirement? How do you intend to reach him once he's behind castle walls? Right now, you have only to break into his residence. I'm afraid it's not that simple. Things don't always work the way one wishes in this world. How can you say such a thing? That hardly sounds like the way of a samurai. Lord Kira is quite advanced in years. He could die any day! Among our men in Edo, Yahei Horibe is 75, and Kihei Hazama is 68. They could be gone by tomorrow too. We can hardly base our plans on that. With your smooth talk you dull the resolve of even the most determined! You betray your duty! That's enough, Toda! I can't bear it anymore! That's enough. Come what may, Kuranosuke was senior counselor of the Asano house. You must not cast indignities upon him. Kuranosuke. I feel so sorry for my husband. In a momentary fit of anger, he brought down both himself and his house, and left his retainers... to face the hardships of the world without a master. And now, for generations to come... people will laugh at him as a reckless simpleton. Surely not, my lady. I still think of his final words. "I would like to have given you some prior word, but it was impossible, so you will no doubt be much taken aback when you hear of this day's events." When I heard those words, I knew immediately that they were intended for you more than anyone else, and they remain etched indelibly in my heart. I cannot bear the thought that no one will avenge the bitter wrong for which he willingly gave up his life and his house, and that he will be made a laughingstock for ages to come as a careless and short-tempered man. Even if he did bring it on himself, I feel so terribly sad for him. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to complain to you. I'll now bid you farewell. My lady... I have a request. This is the 14th, the day our lord died. Might I be permitted to bid him farewell by lighting some incense at his altar? I'm sorry, but I will not allow it. I personally would not stand in your way, but I do not believe Lord Asano would be so pleased to have you pray for his soul. Lady Toda. I brought with me some verses I wrote - mere trifles, really - to while away the hours of my idle life as a ronin. I thought perhaps our lady might find them diverting, and I'd be most gratified if she would read them sometime. Good-bye, Lady Toda. Are you asleep, my lady? My lady? Who is it? It's Toda. I'm sorry to disturb you in your sleep, but I have something I wish to tell you. I wished to speak with you as well and have been longing for morning to come. Could you not sleep? I hope you won't think it silly of me, but I couldn't help feeling something wasn't right with Kuranosuke yesterday. I've been awake all night wondering about it. I can't believe he'd come here on the anniversary of my husband's death only to sadden us with such distressing talk. It's simply not like him. Indeed, my lady. As he was leaving, he gave me this small package and asked me to pass it on to you. He said it contained some verses he wrote. "Trifles" he called them, but I couldn't help wondering, and I lay awake all night fretting about it. Hurry up and open it. Goodness! Some gold coins. It appears to be an account book for the period since he left Ako. There are detailed entries for his expenditures and those of other former retainers. Could this mean - - Lady Toda! - What is it? Lady Toda! What is it? A short time ago, a man in very unusual dress pounded on our gate, tossed this letter inside, and then immediately departed without giving his name. In unusual dress? It's signed by Chuzaemon Yoshida from Ako! Chuzaemon? Hurry and open it! "This morning at 3:00, 47 former Asano retainers led by Kuranosuke Oishi broke into Lord Kira's residence in Honjo." Forty-seven retainers led by Kuranosuke! "As planned, one party led by Kuranosuke broke through the front gate, while a second, led by Chikara Oishi, broke through the back. Striking down all resistance, the men discovered what appeared to be Kira's bedroom, only to find the room empty, with bedclothes scattered about, and swords still on their stand. Since Kira was not in sight, the bedclothes were run through, but to no avail." Did they fail to kill him? "After searching the entire residence three times, a voice was heard from a storage room behind the bedchamber - a voice was heard from a storage room behind the bedchamber. Takebayashi and Hazama broke through the door with their spears, and the man they dragged out matched Kira in age and description. They demanded his name and, looking for the scar left by our lord's blade, indeed found a six-inch gash on his back. There could be no doubt - There could be no doubt that it was Lord Kira." The head. We have brought you the head of your enemy, Yoshinaka Kira. On March 14th of last year, in the Pine Corridor of the castle, your attempt to redress a wrong ended regrettably. Since the Asano house has favored our families for generations, sustaining us in our lives, we could not stand idly by. We joined in a pledge, and from that moment until this, with each day feeling like an eternity, through rain and through snow, shunned by others and scorned by the world, some not knowing where their next meal would come from... young and old alike keeping their ardor high, we longed only to hasten this day. The old and the sick, fearing their time might come too soon, and wishing nothing more than to die honorably in your name, clamored for immediate action without regard for our chances of success, and only with difficulty was I able to restrain them. Finally, in the middle of the night just past, we burst into Kira's residence and took his head, which we have now brought to you. We have carried out your will, so you may now release your pent-up bitterness. In the name of all of us, I humbly report this to you. For the great burden you have all borne since the tragic incident, I thank you on our lord's behalf. In spite of your many hardships, I am sure you now feel a great satisfaction. From 75 down to 15, old and young alike, you followed my orders well and accomplished a great thing. I would like to thank you all personally as well. Chuzaemon. Suke'emon. We have completed our pilgrimage to our master's grave. I want you two to go to the inspector general's residence and report all that has happened since last night. Suke'emon? What's the matter? I wish to remain with the group to commit harakiri. All that is left for us now is to commit harakiri before our master's grave. I do not wish to be excluded from that rite. Heaven has smiled on us, and we have succeeded in our aim. I see no need to rush to our deaths. How can you say such a thing? We've persevered through hardships until this day so that we could carry out a proud revenge that would be deemed righteous in the eyes of the world. It would be easy for us now to slit our bellies on the spot. Although we acted out of loyalty, to the shogunate we are criminals. We must respect the shogun and the law of the land. As his loyal subjects, we must obey the law. Our duty now is to refrain from selfish action and quietly await our judgment. Isn't that how we can best show our constancy as true samurai? Counselor, I will gladly go to the inspector general's residence! THE 46 RONIN FROM AKO WERE PLACED IN THE CUSTODY OF LORD HOSOKAWA OF ETCHU AND THREE OTHER DAIMYO. THE JUDGMENT WAS LONG IN COMING, BUT AFTER 50 DAYS, THE RONIN WERE ORDERED TO COMMIT HARAKIRI. ON THE NIGHT OF FEBRUARY 3, IN THE 16TH YEAR OF GENROKU (1703), AT THE RESIDENCE OF LORD HOSOKAWA IN SHIBA... Please, my lord. I cannot do it. I beg you to charge someone else with the responsibility. Den'emon, you went to Atago Shrine to pray for their lives to be spared, so I understand why you don't wish to be the one to tell them. But it would be a cruel shock for them to learn of the judgment only when the shogun's messenger brings the order tomorrow. I beg your pardon, sire. These flowers have just been delivered from the home of Lady Asano in Akasaka. The messenger asked that they be given to the former Asano retainers in our custody. I'd like to know your instructions. A gift from Lady Asano to the loyal retainers? She must have received word of today's judgment. She sent these flowers to bid them a heartfelt farewell. With a woman's touch, she has made a most thoughtful gesture. That's it, Den'emon. Present these flowers to Kuranosuke and the others at once. To receive flowers while they are awaiting judgment will surely suggest to them their impending fate. Do that, Den'emon. Take them the flowers. You say they are a gift from Lady Asano? Well, well. Such magnificent blooms! Finally we have some flowers for our funeral. No doubt the master of this house is hinting at what we should expect. Master Den'emon, in return for your kindness these many days, we'd like to entertain you with a variety show. Excellent idea! I intend to give the best performance of the night. Mine will be the performance of a lifetime. No, no, my ballads will be the highlight. The old folks in the other room might scold us for the racket. Let them. It'll be the last time. Let's get set up. Plum blossoms are known for their fragrance Cherry blossoms for their blooms People we cannot know by appearances But only by their hearts Gentlemen... Lady Asano has most thoughtfully sent us flowers. Let us bid her a final farewell from here. No, let us simply thank her for the flowers. We can't have a show without Soemon's dance. Soemon! Soemon! You called, sir? - Give us your dance. - Hear! Hear! An excellent performance, as always. Juroza, we still need to hear your flute. Sir. I've just returned from the drawing room, where I thanked Lord Hosokawa for his generous hospitality. Ah, very good. Actually, I have a favor to ask. - Then perhaps I could have a cup of tea? - Certainly. Page, bring us some tea. It would appear that our long wait is over. You will finally be relieved of looking after us. Let me express my deepest gratitude for your many kindnesses. Everyone in the household is at a loss for words. Please have some tea. Thank you. The favor I spoke of concerns this boy. Is he your kin? No. His father and I have been friends since childhood. He is a masterless ronin at present, eking out a meager existence. But humbled as he is, he is still a samurai, and he wishes his son to be one too. If only for half a day, he'd like his boy to be near your men, where he might learn a thing or two about true samurai spirit. So touched was I by his wish that, even at risk of rebuke, I dressed him up as my own boy, hoping he might be allowed to attend to your needs this one day. That is the favor I wish to ask. Do you play the shamisen? Your fingers bear the mark of strings. In my training as a page, I learned some accompaniment for dance. Master Den'emon, I'm sure your intentions are good, but I think it best that you abandon this plan. I have no idea what may have prompted this fabrication, but I think you've gone too far. Please, I apologize. She's a woman. As you can see, she's a woman. But there were compelling and unavoidable circumstances that led her to dress as a man and ask to serve as a page boy. A woman doesn't need to learn the way of the samurai. Perhaps there's a particular person among us whom you wished to see? Yes. I will not be angry with you. Tell me his name. Who is it? Who is it? Jurozaemon Isogai. Please let me see him. I guess this is the last time we'll hear a nightingale sing. I said this is the last time we'll hear a nightingale sing. Oh, was a nightingale singing? Juroza, if you're that heart-struck over her, you should write to her. Lament as you will, there'll be no writing from the afterlife. I can't take that liberty on my own. Besides, I only used her to get nearer to our enemy. She means nothing to me now. You need to think of her feelings. Even if you were only using her, you did promise to marry her. I'll thank you not to poke fun at me on the eve of our death. Aren't you a little young to be so hard on yourself? The shogun's messenger is on his way? When was that? Sometime last July. I learned recently that Juroza was ordered to find out as much as he could about Lord Kira's residence. Around that time, I remember getting a letter from him in Kyoto saying he was studying the Kira residence. He was worried about attracting attention if he lived alone and felt compelled to seek out a family connection. As Juroza put it, if he was going to be a samurai he intended to advance enough to have a horse and carry a spear, and when he asked her father Mokunoshin for her hand, he laid bare his sincere feelings for her. Since Mokunoshin thought him a paragon to begin with, how could he possibly object? His dearest daughter was to marry a son-in-law he could be proud of. Breaking out the 100 ryo he'd left untouched even in the worst of times, and selling off a suit of armor for another 100 ryo, he put together a fine trousseau and hired the largest pleasure boat on the river for a grand reception, fancier than any of us could have imagined. But on the appointed day, Juroza never showed up. The man sent to fetch him found his home empty, and no one could say where Juroza had gone. Stoic warrior though he was, Mokunoshin's mortification and indignation at this betrayal was truly beyond words. And then he read in a newssheet about the December 14th raid on Kira's residence and found Juroza's name listed among the attackers. "That's my son-in-law!" he wailed, over and over, his eyes streaming with tears. Sir, as his daughter I couldn't bear to see him that way, so I dressed like this to enter where no women are allowed. I beg you, please let me see him. In your desire to see Juroza, aren't you merely being caught up in the popular sentiment? I hear people are speaking of us as righteous warriors and men of virtue, as if we're samurai without peer in all the land. You're young. You were swept off your feet. You should be bitter at his betrayal, yet your heart still wants to believe in him. But it's really only a momentary flight of fancy. No matter how you look at it, Juroza heaped dirt on you and your father. You should despise him for it. You should despise him for the rest of your life. You're too cruel. You don't seem to understand a woman's heart, nor the human heart in general. There's one thing I really must know, both as a woman and as a person. I need to know Juroza's true feelings. Was I really just used to advance his hidden plot? Did he never love me at all? Or did he abandon me against his will for the sake of a higher cause? That's what I must know - how he truly feels. Miss Mino. I now have a favor to ask of you. It pains me to do this, but for the sake of all my men, I would ask you to make yourself a sacrifice. Juroza is a samurai, and he has prepared himself. I don't think he'll lose his presence of mind. But he's young. If he sees you and speaks with you now, he might find his resolve shaken, and he could fall to pieces at the critical moment. It's not so difficult to take up a cause in the name of virtue, but to carry one's initial resolve through to the end can be far more difficult than one has imagined. I don't wish to test Juroza's young heart so near the end. You're still young yourself, with your whole life ahead of you. Spend it hating Juroza and you emerge from this unscathed. Remember the bitterness you felt last December when he betrayed you on your wedding day. Carry with you the anger you felt then, let Juroza go to his grave as a despicable liar, and never stop hating him. Could I ask you to do that? Then all that matters is a samurai's good name, nothing is more important than Juroza's final resolve, and not only does my humiliation mean nothing, but I'm forever doomed to wonder whether I was loved or not. Is that what you're saying? Den'emon. Den'emon. Isn't that the Otomeda girl? I'll explain later. What is it? Miss Mino, I can't let you see Juroza. It was wrong of him to deceive you and your family, but there are times when a person has no choice but to lie. Look at yourself. You've come here under false pretenses, dressed as a man. For you, under the circumstances, it was a necessary lie. Forget that you ever met Juroza. That's best for both of you. Now I must ask you to go. Are you saying, sir, that if it serves a higher purpose, it doesn't matter who it may hurt? I can't accept that. If an expedient deception ultimately gains the truth, then the deception does not end as a lie. I came here under false pretenses, dressed as a man, but if I can see Juroza just once, I will turn my deception into truth, and I will find the truth in Juroza's deception too. Find the truth in his deception? I beg you, please let me see him. Sir... the shogun's messenger is on his way. Please be ready. Den'emon. Would you please fetch Juroza? Certainly, sir. Juroza at your service, sir. Come in. Since I am under reprimand, I would prefer to stay here. Juroza! I believe you know Mokunoshin Otomeda's daughter, Miss Mino. Not at all. We've never met. Juroza! The shogun's messenger is on his way from the castle. Never mind that. I'm asking you about Miss Mino. I do not know her. The others are all waiting, Counselor. We must prepare to meet our fate and have no time for this. Excuse me. - Wait, Juroza. - The messenger, Counselor! You're losing hold of yourself. Now, Juroza, take out your tissue pouch. You carry in it a fingerpick for the koto, wrapped carefully in purple silk. I want to see the gold crest on that pick. Show it to me. Juroza... when I said you had annoyed me and I reassigned you to a different room, it was on account of this pick. I know you're at a romantic age... so I wouldn't hold it against you that you secretly kept a koto pick in your pouch. But I was concerned about the important test we all faced. In gazing at your little memento and thinking of its owner, if you started pining to see her, I worried that it might make you waver from your original resolve. The slap on the wrist was intended for your own good. Now, take it out. Show it to me. Please, sir, do not press him further. I am happy just to know that Juroza has carried the pick close to his heart to this very day. There's no need to ask him any more than that. You wish me not to ask and him not to say? You'd let the question go unasked and the response unstated? That's exactly as I would have it. Juroza! Tell your father I am indeed his son-in-law. I am his son-in-law. Good-bye, Miss Mino. "At the time Lord Naganori Asano was responsible for receiving the imperial messengers, he perpetrated an outrage within the castle and was punished for it, whereas Lord Yoshinaka Kira received no chastisement. Wishing to avenge their lord, 46 of Lord Asano's retainers formed a conspiracy, broke into Lord Kira's residence with an arsenal that included firearms, and assassinated Lord Kira. It was an unpardonable act of lawlessness and a direct affront to the shogun. They are hereby ordered to commit harakiri." Had we been given the harshest possible punishment and been sentenced to beheading or hanging, we would have deserved nothing less. Your servant is profoundly grateful that we are permitted to perform harakiri. Stepping out of my official role, I will add a note of my own. Lord Kira's son has had his lands confiscated and his house abolished, and he is confined in the custody of Lord Suwa of Shinshu. I thought you might like to know. Gentlemen. Though he must remain afar, Lord Hosokawa wishes to pay his respects. My master speaks: "Despite many efforts on your behalf, we have come to today's unfortunate verdict, and I express my deepest regrets. At this juncture, nothing more can be done. As brave and righteous warriors, may your hearts be at peace as you prepare to meet your fate." These were my master's words. I trust everybody heard? For the cordial treatment we have received since December we are deeply, deeply grateful. Please relay our thanks to your master. We have provided for your final needs. Please take all the time you need in making ready. Your kindness in every detail... leaves us without adequate words to thank you. Good sirs. Mr. Oishi. Miss Mino! Why have you done this? It's as I said before - so that my expedient deception does not end as a lie. What? When I disguised myself as a man and tricked my way into this house that turned my father out, I wanted in the end to show my unwavering fidelity. Mino! Juroza! Why did you have to act in such undue haste? When one of my fellow overseers discreetly let Lord Hosokawa know of your coming here today, he was deeply moved by Juroza's unwavering faith. Having been sympathetic to the former retainers' cause from the start, he set aside his former displeasure with your father, restoring his house and permitting him to return to service. I'll call a doctor. You must hold on. No, Uncle Den'emon. I am grateful... but then my deception would end as a lie. When my father hears that I took my life, I doubt he can go on living. The Otomeda house must die out. Only then, only then can I fulfill what Mr. Oishi asked of me. For the sake of the 46 loyal retainers... my father and I gladly become the sacrifice. We gladly become the sacrifice. Do away with the Otomeda house. Let the Otomeda house die. Mino. May your heart be at peace at the end. I will join you shortly. Juroza, it's time. We mustn't tarry. - After you, sir. - No, you go ahead. It's my duty to stay until the last moment... to witness the final steps we must all now take. Gengoemon Kataoka has ended his life. Junai Onodera, please come forward. Jurozaemon lsogai... has ended his life. Chuzaemon Yoshida has ended his life. Den'emon. It seems they've all ended their lives without disgracing themselves. We've carried through our original intent. Oishi. Kuranosuke Oishi, please come forward. You must now excuse me. THE END
