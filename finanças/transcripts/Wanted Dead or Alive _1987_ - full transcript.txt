How do you put up with this shit, Danny? Every time I touch one of those scumbags, I- I take a lot of showers, And Louise scrubs my... Back. How is she? That's what you need: A lady. A nice lady for a change, instead of these bimbos you go out with. Let me tell you something. I found one. First name is terry. She's a stewardess. Another stewardess. She's getting her doctorate in anthropology. We've been goin' out for three months now. Three months? Three fucking months? Jesus, that's a goddamn silver anniversary for you. Come on, tell me some more. Louise is gonna ask me a million questions when she finds out you got a girlfriend. Did you tell Louise you bought a motorcycle? No, I didn't tell her I bought a motorcycle. So why should you tell her I got a girlfriend? Piss off. Sign this. She know what you do? No. I told her what I did. She thinks I'm in the security business. I hate this shit. What? Paperwork? Fuck you. Listen, buddy. You burnt your bridges, not them. You wanna build 'em up again, you build 'em. Yeah, sure. Listen. Once you've quit the company, you've quit. Don't they teach you cops how to clean these? Up yours. No. I figure I'll bring in a few more bad guys, put the money in my boat, And see a bit of the world. Ah, you've seen it. But this time without a bull's-eye painted on my forehead. You can't fool me, man. That's exactly what you miss- That bull's-eye. Thank you. You might wanna wait. This is the last ten minutes. I've seen it four times. This is my favorite part. All right. Morrison, city desk. How can I help you? This is Malak al Rahim. Let me save you a little confusion, Mr. Morrison. Tonight you'll be receiving phone calls from a number of people... Claiming responsibility for what I am about to do. Malak al Rahim is supposed to be in, uh, south Yemen. - How do I know it's actually you? - You'll know it was me. I'm outside the fox cinema. Hi, Tommy. Hey, nick. What a wonderful surprise. Bonnie owed me a favor. Took the Denver run, and I've got four days off. I guess I owe bonnie a favor. Oh, you smell so good. Mmm. I'm getting stabbed in the back. "The effect of changing... "climatic conditions... On the nomadic tribes of Maure-tan-ya." Mauretania. Listen, it was a lot more painful reading it... Than it was lying on it, believe me. Are you trying to tell me you want to study? I really should. I don't think so. I don't think so. But there is a great bottle of wine in the fridge. Okay. To bonnie. Where'd you get that? It's not mine. No. It belonged to Jedidiah Larkin. Wagon train scout, mountain man, trailblazer. Even tried his hand at being a lawman. And this was his only constant companion. He was the strong, silent type-a loner. He loved adventure, danger, new frontiers. - Did he ride a motorcycle? - No, he didn't ride a motorcycle. Just after the civil war, he got fed up with what the railroads and the bureaucrats... And everybody else was turning the frontier into, So he sold everything he owned and he disappeared. And nobody knows where he went. He went to san Francisco. He caught a freighter to south America... And, uh, got lost in the arms of the amazon, Lady. You are full of shit. My grandfather used to tell me stories. He would get drunk first, then he would sit on the bed... And tell stories about the old west. About his father, Joshua Randall. About all the other Josh Randalls, Jed Larkins. Nicky, that sounds terrible. Thanks. You're welcome. Toss the line out. Bacon? Sausages? Neither. You get both. So do I. Buttered toast? Huh? Yeah. Why not? All right. This is how I do it. This is a news break. It's nice, Nicky. A terrorist bombing rocked Los Angeles. I think so. Here. Last night about 10:00- Oh, my god, Nicky. Look at this. A series of bombs went off at a Los Angeles movie theater, killing 138 people. That's terrible. Yeah. Have some coffee. Received a telephone call from a man claiming to be Malak al Rahim, One of the world's most notorious terrorists. The man claimed responsibility for the attack, And told the newspaper exactly when and where- Hi, bill. I forgot all about you coming here this morning. Bill, this is terry. Terry, this is bill Stanford. One of my best-paying clients. My pleasure. Nice to meet you. I'm sorry for being rude, But I'm running late, and we have to go over some business. Perhaps you could excuse us. Why don't we take a walk? We'll be back in a couple of minutes. Bill, did you see this? But I would like to say that the police force and our intelligence agencies... Are workin' overtime on this problem. Yeah. Terrible, isn't it? Hundreds more were injured, with several listed as critical. Many more are feared missing, and rescue crews are searching through the rubble at this hour. Authorities say positive identification of some of the bodies may be impossible. Bill Stanford, huh? I like that. What the hell are you doing here? Now that's a nice way to talk to an old friend you haven't seen in three years. Phil, friends are people who show up... In a bathing suit with a six-pack, Not dressed up like one of the brooks brothers. This is company business. Cut to the chase. Okay. Malak al Rahim. That's a lot better. Yeah. He left us his handprint on a telephone booth. We need you. Give me a break. Between the c. I.A., the f. B.I., the I.A.P.D., You've got 4,000 men on the street. Why would you need me? This is a flash point situation, nick. We need the best. Bullshit, "the best." That was three years ago. I'm working my own scams now. Who's bullshittin' who? You and I both know you hate collecting garbage. At least I know who my enemies are. I hate getting stabbed in the back. Well, that hasn't changed. But at least we pay well for the risk. Two hundred in a rearview mirror. Okay. If it's any consolation, It'll be me watching your back. Two hundred and fifty thousand dollars, nick, If you can get it done in a week. Who'd know I'm in? Danny at f. B.I. And... Us. - Lipton? - That's who I work for. No surveillance on me? No interference? And immunity from prosecution. What are you bustin' my balls for? You know goddamn well we can't promise immunity! What's the bonus if I bring him in alive? Another 50,000. Okay. Just wanna know how much I'm gonna lose when I blow this scumbag away. Come on, let's take a ride. I'm gonna tell terry first. Don't bother. She's leaving you a note right now. It seems, uh, her friend bonnie came down with the flu, So they're gonna need terry on the Denver flight. You tricky bastards. Sue me. Get in the car. They figure there were two bombs. One on the gas main and one here in the theater. What do you got? Bad news, Phil. We found the detonator. It was triggered by a state-of-the-art remote solenoid. Very high-tech. Satellite quality. Gives us a place to start. Wanna go get a beer? At this hour? You'll ruin my image. Did you get a good shot? Yeah, real clean. Get it in the pipeline, quick. Okay. We got him. Hmm. Randall really doesn't have much use for you, does he? Ha! Would you do what we're doing to a pal? Your sources are right. This is the guy. A little bonus. I've been waiting to kill him for a long time. A long time. How you doin'? Hey, Phil. Yeah? And who else? No, we're on a clean line. I got a voltage meter right here on the phone. Bullshit. I know you're tapping my phone. You're watching me. If somebody's watching you, Randall, it's not us. I see. Must be Santa Claus. What else is new? That, uh, switch was NASA stuff. There's only one distributor out here in California. Weber electronics. Uh-huh. Yeah. Yeah. And they've accounted for every one of them except eight. Seems they had a burglary. In fact, two. One in December and one last month. L.A.P.D.'s got reports on both of them. We're waiting for them. I'll get it myself. You are my sunshine my only sunshine you make me happy when I feel blue Jesus! Why the tail? You're under protective surveillance. Tell Lipton you lost me. Danny! Get over here! The m. O. On both burglaries is very similar. Yeah, but we got that guy in the December burglary. Dumb schmuck thought Weber electronics was a stereo warehouse. Nailed him in a week. He's been sittin' in county ever since. I wanna talk to him. That's hard, nickel. Today. That's harder. What kind of case you workin' on? It'll pay enough to get the boat finished. Make the call. You son of a bitch. That bull's-eye is back. You remember the number? Look, I told you. I don't know nothin' about no second burglary. All I know is you got me locked up in this fuckin' cage. We're wasting time. Quieres un cafe? Crema y Azucar. You heard him. Cream and sugar, and black for me. I'm not leavin' you alone with him, Randall. He's my responsibility. Make sure it's fresh... And real hot. Sorry, Luis. Hiya, Danny. Hi. I like the cigar. Aah! Let me fuckin' go! Who did you sell your m. O. To? A name. Uh-A name. F-farnsworth, asshole! Farnsworth! Spell it. Honey, horse-shit wrestling's on. You want your dinner, or what? The way you cook, who gives a shit? The bell will ring any minute now... For this exhibition match between the lone strangler... And the Argentine gaucho, Guillermo Martelli. - What is that, mystery meat? - I'll give you mystery meat. Get that. This is my favorite show. You get that. Shit. What do you think of the strangler's chances? Jack, I think the strangler's got- yeah, yeah, I'm comin'. Who is it? I'm looking for Farnsworth. Who wants him? A friend of Luis Sanchez. You buyin' or sellin'? Collecting. What the fuck? What the fuck are you doin', man? Hey, this is my house. Get the fuck outta my house. Hey, I'm talkin' to you, Goldilocks! You don't pay your bills. What the fuck does that- where you goin' with my golf- You play? Get outta there. Play what? Luis says you ripped him off. Yeah? The son of a bitch is a liar. I paid him the thousand dollars. I sent the goddamn Cuban cigars. I even tried to get his prison sentence shortened. I couldn't get to anybody. What the fuck does he want? More. He's getting out tomorrow. Man needs an uzi. Five hundred bucks and he's got an uzi. I'd like to know the name of the rag head... You sold the detonators to. You said you didn't sell nothin' dangerous to those Arabs! Shut up! You shut up! Everything's in the garage! Everything! The guns, the records! I want all that stuff out! I didn't want him to do any of this! Relax. You made it out of Nam alive, Didn't you? Yeah. That's too bad. A lot of good guys didn't. Yeah, Phil, I got a name. Abdul Renza. R-e-n-z-a. Student at u. C.L.A. I need an address, license plate - anything you can get. And tell Lipton to pull the surveillance on my boat. Ah, don't give me that bullshit. I not only made the bastard, I marked him for you. Yeah. The sequence of events is very important. First we have to create enough heat. These four tanks all contain flammable liquids. They have to be ruptured with an incendiary device. Then this tank here containing oxygen... And this one containing hydrogen have to be blown in that order. That will increase the heat and create water vapor. The next thing is to blow the refrigeration system... And the methyl isocyanate tank. When that tank blows, The m. I.C. Will become aerosol. The prevailing winds will do the rest of your job for you. Conservative estimate: 30,000 dead. This will make Bhopal, India look like a minor traffic accident. Yeah. Hi, Phil. How you doing? I'm at a drive-in having dinner. Did you get me the address? Yeah. Oh, I know where that is. Yeah. I got it. And a black Mercedes 450sl. Isn't it nice to have money? Yeah. Talk to you later. Yeah. This is 1436. Run a sweep on my line, will you? I'll hold. All clear, huh? Thank you. Randall sure is fast. Yeah. Faster than I gave him credit for. We're gonna have to haul ass to, uh, make this thing happen. Where is he now? Somewhere downtown. He's in his car. Your Arab contact is what- Six, seven layers away from Malak? Randall's downtown. If I knew that, we wouldn't have to set up Randall. What's your leak-time, Henderson? It usually takes a couple of hours for stuff to run the grapevine. We have to slow down Randall. Then I'll take care of that too. Come in, walker. all right. Philmore Walker, this is Dave Henderson. He's in from Denver. Phil's the name. How do you do? Nice to meet you. You should get yourself an electric. Think of the money you will save in band-aids. Oh. Oh, that's very good. I-I think I'll take your advice. - How's your boy doin'? - Good. He's zeroed in on the suspect that bought the solenoids. Terrific. Do we give him backup? You wanna get some guys killed? Uh, I don't understand. He already beat the shit out of one poor bastard this morning he thought we had following him. Every law enforcement agency in this country is on this case. It's possible that someone is following him. - But not from this office? - Not from this office. You got the address, right? Alteransa. Wilshire and Arden. Okay. Amir. Here he comes. - Yeah? - Watch your back. Target's been delayed. Malak. Unit 23. Unit 23. We have Renza's building under surveillance. Suspend delay. Ten-four. Hey, pat, the fed's signalling you. Okay, just sign this, sir, and you're free to go. By the way, Mr. Randall, I suggest in the future you exercise just a little bit more caution... In your driving. Good night. Malak wants them both dead. Here's the address. Aziz sent this... Just in case. I see him. He's driving into Renza's garage now. Renza's black Mercedes just pulled into the driveway. Ow! They were using him as bait. They thought I'd be stupid enough to risk myself to kill just one man. Okay, Renza, who sent you to Farnsworth? Who sent you? Who wanted those detonators? I don't know. A name! Come on! Aziz! Aziz! Robert Aziz! Robert Aziz! Robert Aziz! Aah! Shit! We want him alive! He's got a bomb! You killed those men! I could've stopped him. The object of the mission was to take at least one of them alive. Weren't you briefed? Nick. You stay out of this. You son of a bitch! Get that out of my face... Or you're a dead man. Who the hell do you think you are... You can use me as bait? You're a fisherman, Randall. Live bait works best. I know this is out of character for you, Lipton, But I want the truth. Why me? Beirut. February, 1978. Remember? Oh, come on, Randall. You were given an assignment to terminate five enemy operatives. Four are dead. The one you missed wants your ass. Malak al Rahim, As he now calls himself. He should really thank you, because you made him number one. But the other four were his friends. There's no way... He could have known that it was me... Without your help. Sure. But, uh, we'd already moved you to south America, Saving you up for a rainy day. Check your hook, asshole. You're losing your bait. You're better off with us than without us, Randall. We got a lot of men on you. There's no way you can slip us. Don't bet on it! Uh, you better go placate your desert dwellers before they find out you set 'em up. Oh, right. What the hell's the point in sending him out there? It's over. We blew it! We scared him off. You don't understand, pat. We're not dealing with one of your home-grown scumbags. Malak's an animal. He doesn't get scared. He gets even. Next time you decide to fuck me, Lipton, Kiss me first! Unit seven, he's headin' towards you. Armand, garbage. I swear to you- I had no idea there was that much surveillance out there. That's all right, Henderson. Don't worry. This is unit 42. I'm on him. I'm behind him, heading north on Figueroa. Hey! Lock it up. He's on foot. Mr. Lipton. Randall gave us the slip. How many goddamn men do you need to cover one man? You - get outta the way! Wait a minute. No. Lipton, it's for you. Lipton. You've got four men. Follow anybody that leaves there. But don't blow Henderson's cover. Yeah. You got anything? Yeah. A headache. Henderson went in, but he didn't come out. We lost Randall. You lost Henderson. We're still no closer to Malak. We're doin' just fuckin' great, ain't we? Randall will surface, and Henderson can take care of himself. What's that? Alcohol, tobacco and firearms sent us a list of everything that Farnsworth... Admitted selling to Renza. Christ. They're loaded for bear. I tell you something, john. He is planning something real big. Oh, I thought he was here on vacation. A boat. Where? Where? Where? Where? A boat, a boat. Where? Where? San... Pedro. Where? San Pedro boat works. Good. How do we know he's telling the truth? Look at him. Look at him! You wouldn't lie to me, would you, agent Henderson? Would you? Kill him? Nicky? Shh. You came to see me. I wasn't here. You're leaving right now. You gotta leave. You understand? No. You gotta leave! Nicky, what the hell is going on? It's not as bad as it looks. It's a game. These guys are following me. I'm trying to give them the slip. Are you in trouble? It's business, old business. Are you in danger? I just gotta disappear. For how long? A week. Maybe less. What can I do to help? Just be here when I get back. Hmm? Sure. Terry. I love you. I love you. As soon as I leave, Turn on the light. Pretend I wasn't here. And don't watch me go. Okay? All right? Not okay? No. Nicky. You forgot something. Oh, yeah. Hi, Phil. Hey. Who's on board? Just his girlfriend. We searched the boat earlier. It was empty. She just showed up a little while ago. Uh, Quintz here. You wanna have some fun? Mm-hmm. I'm trying to lose a tail. My raincoat is waiting for you in a garbage can on fourth and flower. Put it on. Drive down to my boat. Park the car, leave the keys... And take the boat out for a couple of hours. Uh, yes, sir. If they think I'm on the boat, they'll stop watching the loft, and I need to get in there. Mm-hmm. And Danny, if you fuck up, I'm gonna tell Louise about the motorcycle. Just as soon as I can, lieutenant. Another special assignment? Uh, yeah, darling. Very special. Be careful. I always am. Good morning, Randall. Don't approach him, Phil. He's under surveillance. Nick? Nicky? Hi, terry. I'm Danny. If we don't get our asses out of here quick, they're gonna know I ain't nick. Grab that line, will you, sweetheart? Nick! Phil, are you nuts? Let me go. Goddamn it, there are people in there! They're charred bone fragments by now, baby. It's a goddamn incinerator. Take your fuckin' hands off of me. Nick! Nick! Goddamn it! Lock up the fuckin' harbor! Lock it up. Lock it up! This is walker. Patch me through to Lipton. Lipton. Randall's dead. Malak? Blew up his boat. Pull all surveillance on Randall. Come on in... For reassignment, walker. Don't you move, you fuck. Don't turn around. Just get me outta here. Start the car. Don't. What the fuck is this? I saw you get on that boat. That wasn't me. That was Danny. Who's Danny? You think I knew they were using you as bait? Yeah, I did. Why the fuck would I do some shit like that? God. I don't know- It hurts. I just lost my best friends. Fifteen years, nick. Fifteen goddamn years! I want Malak. Help me. Whatever you need. I need an address. Robert Aziz. We have reason to believe that Malak al Rahim is here in Los Angeles... And was responsible for the bombing- Despite what federal intelligence agencies are saying. And I want people to know... That the Los Angeles police department is doing everything in its power... To protect them and bring those responsible to justice. For one thing, we've learned that the registered owner... Of the boat, who was killed in this morning's explosion, Was a former federal agent, once linked to antiterrorist activities... In the middle east. It's clear to us that the two bombing incidents are related. That of course was chief of police Donald Gatler. If chief Gatler is right, the two people killed on the boat... Bring the death toll to 173 people in just 36 hours. That number is likely to climb. Officials say many more victims are in critical condition in I.A. Hospitals. Meanwhile, the man thought to be responsible for the killings, Malak al Rahim, may be at large somewhere in Los Angeles. Rahim is believed to have killed thousands of people... In terrorist bombings in Europe and the middle east over the last ten years. But despite his notoriety, he is a mysterious figure, Known only to a handful of disciplined followers. Here is a photograph of the man police are looking for. - Yeah. - Aziz's address: 734 east Bedford. Remember, 6:00. Somebody just delivered an audio tape to ABC news. A guy claiming to be Rahim says there's 50 car bombs planted all over the city. L.A.P.D. Is begging for more men. We're stretched to the limit now. Malak's just waiting for us to thin out our surveillance. Hey, that's our job, protecting the public. My job is to get that maniac. Your fuckin' friend couldn't work with us. No. He had to go get himself killed. I'm sure he's more upset about that than you are. Malak. Let me out of here, please. Let me out of here! Please. I want Malak al Rahim. I don't know Malak al Rahim! Please. I don't know. Let me out- An address. Please! I- an address! Come on. Can't you hear me? No, no! Please! In oil drum factory! They're in the oil drum factory! One-zero-six imperial avenue! The recap. Seven car bomb explosions... Have rocked the greater Los Angeles area in the past half hour. This just came in. The death toll- Nine now. Random bombings. He's creating chaos. It's a diversion. Hmm. He's doing one hell of a job. He's got I.A.P.D. And everybody else spread paper thin. The bastard's playing with us. The I.A.P.D. Just acted on a gunshot complaint. House full of explosives and an Arab named Aziz. They're holding him for us. Let's go. Come on. Let's go! A bomb destroyed a school bus with at least 25 children inside. Allah be with you. Stay in the drum until you hear Malak sound the horn. Remember, wait for the signal. C.I.A. Who's in charge here? Sergeant nelson. Where's the suspect? Somebody sent him down those stairs in that cabinet over there, But we've got him back upstairs now. Out. We're gonna question him. Walker, close that door. yeah? Mr. Lipton, we just found something downstairs. 1-3-0-9 quarterdeck. Well, let's see if that means anything. Gimme that. I guess it means something. What've you got? empty drums. Open up the gate. Go ahead on. Any activity? There are people inside. But nobody's come out. We're moving our people into position. We're in position. Hit it. F.B.I.! Freeze it! Search the house. Look at this. The theater. Bingo. Yeah, that's what killed those people in Bhopal. Hey. Come here. Where is that plant? Where is that plant? Find that plant. Can you sign it? Come on, come on, man. How many plants can there be storing that stuff? Look at this. They rented an armored car this morning. Lipton! Sendrax chemicals. El Segundo. Hey, who the hell are you? Hey, man- Shit, man. That looked like Randall. That son of a bitch. Drive! That is him. Kill the truck driver! We got the right place. It's already started. Do we have men in the area? Good. Let's secure the area around the methyl isocyanate tank. Keep 'em away from there. Come on. Get us out of this mess. The horn. Now! Secure this area! Take your positions! The horn! - Hit it. - No. - We'll do it ourselves. - Jamilla, hit it! - No! - Turn! - No! Turn! Here he comes! Hey. Did we get Malak? Some guy was chasing him in a semi. We still don't know where they are. Malak. Get up! That's good. Kill me, Randall. Kill me! No. Kill me, or I'll kill you! Kill me. Kill me. Kill me, Randall. No. No. Come on. No. You son of a bitch. Kill me. I am not a criminal. I'm a soldier. And I deserve to die like a soldier! You're no soldier. You're a fly on a pile of shit. Look over there! You have some explaining to do. We all have some explaining to do. Like I told you, whatever you need. It's less than a week, and he's still alive. You owe me some money. Where shall I send the check? Send the $250,000 to the widow... Of detective sergeant Danny Quintz. I'll pick up the bonus myself. Fuck the bonus. Grenade! Randall! Randall, you son of a bitch! leave him alone! Leave him the fuck alone.
