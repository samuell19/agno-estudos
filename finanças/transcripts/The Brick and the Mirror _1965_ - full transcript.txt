They're just looking for a pretext, you know. All the same, we must get rid of the body. - Yeah! - But how? Let's set the house on fire. - Yeah! - Not a bad idea. We burn the body first, then the house. Let's do it at once, so that no one will understand. After Mogul conquest until the beginning of the Constitutional Revolution A cold dark night fell over the dry branches of the forest. [text written and read by Golestan] The hunter trod through the thicket stealthily. But in the dark, the pulse of danger constantly throbbed. The forest was full of sparks of fear and worry. The night was hard. The night seemed long. Nothing was refleced in the round eye of the owl but anguish. And fear was its only life sign. The hunter advanced slowly. Every Beast was staring at the trap And the eyes of the thousand-eyed perils were wide. The night was heavy with darkness. And in the dark, no one could tell who is the hunted and who is the hunter.

Madam! Your child! Woman! Where are you? Your child! What is it? What do you want, Brother? What's the matter? This child belongs to the lady who just came in. No one has come here. She came a minute ago. She wore a black veil. She left this child Nobody has come. There is nobody to come. But this child! God keep it for you. But the child's not mine! Understand? Where is she? Where is who? Nobody comes here. This is an abandoned place. A woman in black ... understand? She got out of my taxi ... understand? And I took her here ... Where is she? Listen, what do you want? Are you deaf? Why are you shouting? You are looking for something you cannot find here. You are looking for someone you cannot find here. She did not come here. What can I do for you here? There's only me and you and two other people. There's only me with two other poor wretches. Come and see. Here's one of them. He is disabled, he's a cripple. He is likes to play the ney. There's the other one. Her husband left her a long time ago. She's pregnant. She's about to give birth. But her husband left her. She's lost her mind waiting She sleeps during the day, and stays up all night. Always waiting for him to return. The other was a friend of my son. One day he fell from up there. His legs were smashed. He was finished. As long as my son was here, he would take care of me. My son Asghar was a foreman. When the shut-down came, he went elsewhere. And we never heard from him again. And those two were left in my care. The poor dears, they still have hope. But no one would ever return. There was once a field here. One day they came. They sold everything The wheat and the barley stood high ... but men brought lime and mortar. They dug for foundations, they laid the concrete to build up walls. So many walls. All over, they built up walls. Oh my God, from nothing they built up walls. And the only man who wanted to rebuild the house... he said suddenly: stop! He said suddenly: stop! That was many years ago. Neither a roof, nor a room, nor a kitchen neither barley nor lucerne # I came to you but the door was locked. # Locked with all sorts of locks. # If you don't want me, I'll leave. # I'm going for a walk in the city ??? # It's pouring rocks in here. - Go away! # This is the city of wonders.

He's no good anymore for you? On the contrary. Don't be wicked. Why do you stare at me? Go and get me something to eat. A slut left this child in my taxi. yes, I say: yes You should have tried to find her. how she left this child in your taxi? It is meaningless :"She left" How did she leave you? She just left, like that. She got in at the fruit merchants of Pahlavi street She wore a black chador I couldn't see the baby. She paid and got out. Then I heard the baby cry. I called after her, but she was gone. she was nowhere, it was as if the earth has swallowed her God is Almighty. Completely gone. No! Partially gone! I ran after her. On one side there were a lot of steps. On the other, a tomb. Further on, a building site, inside a mad woman. A weird place. It was dark. I could see nothing. With high walls all around. ??? a mad woman told a goose is dead! - you say mad?! it's very interesting Poor woman! Poor woman! I am thinking how she must feel. It's her child, the child is her relation the child is a Beloved See what poverty does! She took a taxi. See what an empty stomach does to you. Hunger that forces a person to leave her child This bereaved mother is burning now ... in the flames of her sorrow and despair. She is suffering, sighing in this black night ... in the cold darkness. There, up on the hill, she implores God under the stars. It's raining outside. So what! Do the stars melt away when it rains? - Eating her heart out ... - Right now she's tearing out her hair. she's tearing out her hair How will she find her baby again in this big city? big city! From North to South, East to West, From Javadiye and Ghalee Morghi to Dowshan Tappeh, to Tehranpars, Ozgol and Ghardaneye, how will she find her baby? God is Almighty. Imagine the poor woman. You should have tried to find her, my dear. Don't you understand? I tried to, for two hours. That's why I was late and had this quarrel with Abbas. And you did not find her? God is Almighty. Have you told the Police? You should tell the Police. Yes dear, go to the Police. You must tell the Police. Tell the Police? Yes, dear. You want him to go to the police? Yes, dear. To go to the Police, to tell the Police? All right? Go! They are your friends, surely. Do you know what you're saying? Isn't it silly to walk straight into a trap? And if the woman is playing a trick? Waiting at the Police Station for ... Your name, please? Yes, Mr. Hashem. She's waiting in there, and you walk into the trap. - God is Almighty. - What do you mean? Yes, that is the question. This is a frame-up. The gentleman arrives, the woman cries: "Help! Help! Get him, the rat, the murderer!" God is Almighty. For what ah? For what?! Man must think Oh yes? She has called a taxi, and that's all? She has left a baby ... that's simple? This is a trap, friend ... your name? Mr. Hashem Mr. Hashem be sure it's a trap. As soon as you go in, she will shout "Officer, please ..." This beast ... This devil ... This I don't know what ... he took me to a far-off hill, I cried, I pleaded, but no! He snatched my bag ... my necklace ... my earrings my bracelet my money my virtue He ruined my honour! The stained my purity! Then he threw me away. He said if I cried he'd kill me. He beat me and he kicked me, and then he stole my baby. This bloodthirsty This is unfair he stole my baby. my baby! my dear! Now then, are you satisfied? go away Go to the Police, now. God is Almighty. He says the truth, Mr. Hashem The woman probably played a trick? Eat pistachio God is Almighty. And that's not all. Perhaps she has kidnapped the baby. And seeing that she couldn't hide it, she's arranged it this way. It is not possible?! Now, you go to the Police, and so would the parents. What will happen now, my dear? You fall into trouble They're there now. And you try to prove you're a taxi-driver! But I am a taxi-driver. I have my licence. Your licence? You have a licence to find lost children? What does your licence have to do with this? He's right. But he must tell the police. Tell what? Tell everything. Yes, dear. Tell everything? You want to tell everything? my dear sir my dear But you're scared, my dear, really. You say you've seen a tomb and a mad woman. "I saw the grave" and "I saw the mad woman" That did not mean anything There are no tombs in the middle of a city. Nobody is mad in this city. It's the kind of talk! I'm coming So what I say is nonsense? As to the steps ... What steps? The stairs are a problem? You ordered your dinner. You're going to the Police? I'm going to take a piss. Then why do you take it along? So what? With the child in your arms, you fight, you drink, you take a piss Who does he think we are? Does he hope we'd believe him? Hashem is a dear boy. He's a bit dumb He likes him that way. It's none of my business anyway ... but what he says sounds a bit shaky to me. To me too, it's shaky. Yes, it's nonsense. No, it makes no sense. Why not? Stairways in the street. What does that have to do with this child? Abbas Abad is on the hill Yousef Abad is on the hill People need stairs to go up and down. Without stairs, who could they go up and down? If it did not exist Perhaps he was saying that it was a pit He's right. The woman, no doubt, had her house on the hill. You don't follow me. He's not telling the truth. He does not want to tell the truth He does not want to go to the Police, but he has to. he's afraid of going. Instead he's gone to the toilet. And if he runs away He's right ... suppose he does? And if he runs away Where to? Anywhere. The child is here. Oh, have some pistachios. Where is Hashem? Go and get some pistachios, Taji. you're cute! Eat I don't know. God is Almighty. A child in a taxi! Nonsense! A baby is not a pair of gloves... Or tissue paper Oh, Mr. Hashem. You know what? Have your dinner first. Miss Shirin got annoyed by your fight and left Hell! she went Eat first, and then take the baby... Eat first take the baby... and get a taxi... and leave the baby in the taxi. That will solve everything. And if the driver is out, you just run! She had a black veil. What you need is not a veil, you need guts! - He should go to the Police. - What for? To tell them the truth. What is the truth? Where is the truth? - That will lead him into trouble. - What trouble? ??? All right. Go ahead. Take it to the Police and tell the truth. Don't spoil the charm of the case. What is the truth? Mediocrity! Let him imagine with grace. There is much more truth in imagination. Besides, Man's word is like a pit. If you talk, you have opened a pit. You tell the truth and you fall into the vertical pit ... It is very difficult to save yourself from a vertical pit never to come out again. But lies. They're not straight. You fall less deep They're easy to climb out of. You can always go out Look at this crossword puzzle. You and your crossword! And you, have some pistachios! What crap! He wants to eat pistachios. None of your business! (?? ?? ?? ????) he does not know what the crosswords is at all! tall fool! When the lines take shape! You fill a line, and another line forms itself. The crossword puzzle is a lot of empty squares first. The further you go, the more animated they become. Until you have the answers even before reading the questions. But this tall fool does not know of the joys of Art. Crossword puzzles are like creation. You have an idea. You imagine and you put a letter in a square. A neutral letter ... a detached letter ... But each a free foundation of truth. An integral part of truth. Another letter, and still another. And then you have reality. A beautiful flower ... A great star A book of poems. An important poet Athir al-Din Akhsiketi The unfaithful wife of Marcus Aurelius? Annia Galeria Faustina. The mistress of Richard I ??? Lady Robert Paul Cambridge ??? The great novel of Sigrid Undset? Kristin Lavransdatter A character from Dostoyevsky? Alexei Nilych Kirillov. No! In the beginning there was not the word. In the beginning, there was the letter. You go this way, it makes a word. You go this way, and it makes another. You take it out and it destroys. It destroys two truths. The horizontal. And the vertical. Oh, shut up! What is he saying? Incantations? Don't be jealous. What do you mean, jealous? He won't stop. Be quiet. Parivs is an intellectual. He's got talent. It is an honour and a privilege that he's with us What a down-grading to be at the same table with you. Now, be quiet a little You with your cissy ways, you are wasting your time here. with your gesture of understanding. with "Do not be a man" Do something You ought to make good and go ahead in life. Do something. Change your name, establish connections and become important. Enough, Taji! There is something wrong with your head. There is something wrong somewhere with all of us. There is nothing wrong anywhere with you, presumably. There is, in fact. It is that the papers come out in the evening. As soon as I buy them, it's time to go to the caf? and ... there I hardly find the time to do my crosswords. I'm going to get some food. Why should I be angry? I can arrest everybody! [Poster ??? ] I told you politely, doctor, that I'll give you a policeman. He'll accompany you to the place you show him. And he'll arrest whomever you indicate. And I told you that I could not see where I was being driven. Then too, I was confused for a while You don't know their place, you don't recognize their faces. I told you I couldn't see anything. Then what do you expect me to do? Put policemen everywhere. Why is the gentleman undressed? The gentleman is a doctor. A woman calls saying that her daughter ... is in labour. The doctor goes with her. Outside in the street, two men were waiting in a taxi join them, apparently. ???ǡ ?????? Apparently! Don't catch cold. According to the woman, one of the men was her brother and the other her son in law, the pregnant woman's husband The doctor goes with them. But this turns out to be a trap. They beat up the doctor. Apparently ... Apparently. And rob him of what he had. His watch. His watch, his bag, his wallet, all were gone. They all vanished into thin air ??? ?? ?Ԙ? ?? ???? ?? ?? ?????? Including the woman in labour? I wish it were at least like that Well, the woman was there all right. And she had such a terrible time too, giving birth. I saved her life after great difficulties ... but the child was dead. The child was dead? Must pregnant women always deliver babies that are alive? But this happened two weeks ago. Yes, the child was dead. Then why do you report this now? The child was dead two weeks ago. The incident happened tonight. I'm sorry. Your being sorry will undo nothing, now that I'm beaten up. Robbed, left with all my instruments smashed. This story of tonight's pregnant woman had been a trick. The doctor, two weeks ago, performed an operation in the hospital ... in which the child dies. Tonight, her relatives take revenge. What revenge? Why? The child had no chance of living at all! A creature with no head, with bad smell (??? ???) A walnut Its legs like cornichons ... this size This is the size of the belly (!?????? Ԙ?) And you, what do you want? I say that this sort of thing cannot go on and on. I am a taxi driver - Neither its birth or its death ... - About two hours before, a woman left the child in my taxi had anything to do with me. Revenge on me? From the moment of its conception until it died ... Or was dying I had nothing to do with it. Revenge on me If the gentleman has a complaint, start an inquiry, then. What's the use? Complaint against whom? I say, why was I beaten up? It's you who were beaten up, and you want me to know why? What did you say? I say that's how you lose faith. And you... say - I said, about two hours ago, at the fruit-market ... - That's why nobody trust anybody anymore. Wait a moment. Why should I wait? That's why nobody helps anybody anymore. Waiting for what? How long can I wait?! We spend our lives waiting. Go and see what's going on outside! These things happen, doctor. You should know that. You are a doctor! You should know You should be prepared for such incidents. I cannot be prepared for being beaten up. The sick man who comes to you cannot say: "I am not prepared for my operation" or to feel unwell, fall ill and have a fever Nonsense! (lit.: What are those words?) These incidents, for us, are like the dust in the air. Like the mud in the alley. When we walk, they settle on our hair and our clothes. As a routine, you brush them away. I ask you, is that just and right? The just and the unjust, the right and the wrong ... varies according to people's conceptions. I have nothing to do with people's conceptions. You're a doctor, people have something to do with you. But we have a general rule, ?????: rule after all. The general rule depends ... It depends on who we are aggressor or victim we have seen for years... we have heard for years: the one who beats ... says one thing, and the one who is beaten says another. And you ... what do you think? about which case? It varies from case to case. I'm here to keep order and discipline. Exactly! You hold the destiny of an entire neighbourhood in your hands. Oh, I'm myself from this neighbourhood. I'm an employee of the municipality. There's a couple quarelling. The man says his wife has put DDT in his soup. They are here with their children. You were saying? I'm asking what is to be done? Aren't they dry yet? You may catch cold. To catch cold is natural. But it's unnatural to be beaten up. They are the same, doctor. Things are like that. Perhaps you are expecting too much: "People in general aren't bad" these people need you and me, Let's hope for one day to come ... when there'll be no more thefts or incidents like that. Then, there would be no more need for a Police Station. Then they'd have made so much progress that there would be no more sickness. And if anybody gets sick, he would treat himself. Like we shave ourselves these days. But until that day, I volunteer to be an officer, and you a doctor. And you expect that there'll be no more sick men and thieves? What do you want? - I said ... - Come here. Sit down. I'm a taxi-driver. About three hours ago, in front of the fruit market.. On Pahlavi Street.. a woman in a black chador ... The rain has stopped. I did not see her face correctly You know, doctor: I think you should always carry a gun. A doctor who has to visit patients at night should always carry a gun. They don't even deserve the injection and the thermometer. A gun is a better remedy than any medical treatment. Look at them Look how they stare at us! The night wakes them up, it gives them life. They disappear during day. What are they staring at? Why are they staring?! I don't know ... do you? No. No. You do not know Even if you did, you couldn't put it into words. You develop the power of speech only by growing up. And as you grow up your brains grow tired. Good bye. Your complaint? I don't know what to do? Look what sort or people become doctors! I haven't got a place for myself. I'd rather die than deliver myself into the hands of such doctors. I cannot look after it. At least ... you talk Didn't you hear? There is no place for a child at night in a Police Station. At the police station, you will find a place for everyone, except for an infant baby A Police Station is no place for a child. They should grow up first. The grown-ups have left no room for the children. Thieves and crooks, drunks and gamblers, opium-addicts and amulet makers ??????? Take care of it until the morning. If it isn't claimed by its parents it'll have to go to an orphanage. Well? Why are you here? let's go where are the others? Did you come alone? Where should we take it to now? Let's go now We're going out here now So you won't take him away?! Wait! Are they allowed to go, the couple with the child? It's nothing. We came by ourselves. You may go. Why did you come? - I was worried? - Why? Like that. The officer didn't seem to believe me. He just wants to advise He was telling me to keep it. Why did you come? I was worried. I thought it would take too long. I was worried it woud be hungry. I brought it some milk. Now till morning... What will happen Are you tired? Give it to me. And I wanted to spend the night with you. We're together now. What shall we do? What about? - Can you keep it until tomorrow? - Why not? All right then. I'll call you a taxi and you go now. Go where? You said you'd keep it tonight. Take it home with you. You said you wanted to spend the night with me. All right, you go and I'll come later. But I can't take this child to where I live. But you said you'd keep it. I thought we'd go to your place. My place? With all those neighbours? At this hour? With you and the child? Don't be angry. Wait.... So I could keep up with you walk slowly walk slowly Don't go so fast, let's walk together. Walk slowly, I'm tired. I don't feel well. What's the matter? Get up. Give him to me.

[radio] In our Sacred Book the Quran it is written: [radio] You who are religious, fear God Shout, my dear Shout Shout as loud as you can Shout before you grow up and become a coward. [radio] And be not like those who forgot Allah... I feel like crying, too. [Radio] so Allah ... [Radio] ...made them forget themselves. Those are the defiantly disobedient. Look Taji, don't get angry. [Radio] Not equal are the companions of Fire and the companions of Paradise. I have no will of my own in here. [Radio] The companions of Paradise - they are the attainers [of success]. I have this small corner, with thousands of eyes watching me. [Radio] If we had sent down this Qur'an... upon a mountain... It's too late now, anyway. There're out in the yard already and they're washing their faces [Radio] you would have seen it humbled and coming apart from fear of Allah. If they hear the child and you... I said you [Radio] And these examples we present to the people... [Radio] then perhaps they will give thought. And how do you dare to breathe? [Radio] He is Allah, besides Whom there is no other deity, Knower of the unseen and the witnessed. Well, what are you going to do now? You always say:"what are you going to do?" "what are you going to do?" "what are you going to do?" Well, what can I do? [Basmala] ??? ???? ?????? ?????? Listen, Taji. Don't be fretful because I got angry All right, don't shout. Don't be angry. [Invocation of God] ??? ???? ?????? ??????. ?? ????? ?? ????. ??? ? ???.. You can't go out now. Stay here. I'll take her out secretly. I'll lock the door from the outside I'll tell the old woman* [housekeeper who goes to the room, lights the radiator] I'll tell her that she mustn't come in. - [Invocation of God] - You stay here until evening. Then I'll come and fetch you. - The child is hungry. - Give her to me. Where will you take her? Wherever you say. Give her to me. Don't shout! Give her to me You know I must take her first to the police. Just formalities ... You guarantee ??? You guarantee ??? ... Just formalities you have to engage But if you're out now...You can't. I must take her. Then I'll come back to fetch you. Later we'll go together. All right? Give her to me. Buy her some milk. Wrap her nappies. Wrap her. - Be careful. Come back soon - ok ok ok Her scarf. Hurry. Dear! Let me go. If you're hungry, there's some gaz* in there. [*nougat candy} Wait till I come back. ["please keep silent in here"] Salaam. Salaam. Yes? Madam, I have brought this child. Very kind of you. This is an abandoned child. The place is full of them. Now you bring another one. - And you? - I want a baby. I want a baby. that's two or three days old. Fat? Thin? Short? Tall? Black? Blond? Boy? Girl? You see! Is it imperative that it should be two or three days old?! Hallo. You are expecting? How many months? Nine. You are about to deliver one now? Are you collecting them? ??? I'm afraid of them. They don't leave me alone. Where did you find it? I'm a taxi-driver. Somebody left her in my car. Why do you cry? I'm afraid of them. My neighbours. They don't leave me alone. They don't leave me alone. You'll have your baby... Today or tomorrow ... your time of delivery will come Perhaps it'll be still-born. You'll make another one then. They all have been still-born so far. Perhaps I shall never have a baby. That's my trouble. "That's my trouble" is nonsense. Your trouble and our work. They are different. And you? I want a job... Please...- Anything you have... This is not an employment agency, Madam. Whenever anyone wants something, they come here! You must go to the police first. Last night I did that ... There I was told to keep her until this morning. I wanted to keep pigeons. That didn't work. Then I went for cats. [pre-revolution Sokhan Magazine Behind the magazine: Samak-e Ayyar ??? That didn't work either. I want to live. Everybody is reproaching me. They tell me I am unable to have a child. I'm dying from the grief... They don't leave me alone. Don't be silly. You'll have a child. I can't! It'll be still-born. You first deliver. If it is still-born, you'll make another one. I can't. I can't. - I want a baby I can't. I can't. I can't. I can't. Look! Don't be embarrassed. This is the child. This is the 9th month. And the 8th. 9 long months. Each time I added rug on rug. My belly got bigger with rugs! From the first day I added rugs to pretend I am pregnant. [Portrait of the Shah and the Queen Soraya] ??? at that time [1343] Farah was married to the Shah - maybe an older portrait still hanging So they think .... my vow [???] ??? I light candles ... make a vow ... say prayers ??? avowed... and I become pregnant A belly full of rugs. No baby growing. No belly skin stretching. Lies, lies to fool. Rugs don't become moving babies. a baby who moves Rugs ... only rugs... Here we don't accept babies except those without identity. You'll have to get the tribunal's certificate. that the child has no identity before we could accept him. Throw those rugs out. You too should go to the tribunal. We can't give a child to just anybody who walks in. We protect them here. We would give a child, but only to whom we trust. And you? What do you want? I'm her husband. Excuse me. Could you please write a few words for me? - What about? - A request. What request? To the tribunal. Can't you write yourself at your age? Isn't it a shame that you are illiterate? Don't you know that an illiterate is blind? Go to night-school. I can, but only a little. A little is not enough. You have a complaint? You have a child. Your wife has left you? They seduced her. Yes? Oh no, I'm not married. This child was left in my car. Left in your car? A woman. When she got in I didn't notice. When she left, there was this child crying. I looked everywhere for her, but she had disappeared. I'm now requesting the tribunal to let me keep her. Keep her? Yes, by writing this request. Keep her? What for? Keep her ... just keep her. Keep her. But you are not married. No, I'm not married. - You're alone? - Yes, alone. What's your job? I drive a taxi. Any good? Good enough. You have a wife ? No You have a job that works all right. Nobody's under your care... and you are asking for headaches? You're a fool. A child needs milk, food, clothing. There's sickness. All sorts of it. And the changing of the nappies. Are you crazy? You'd drive your taxi and you'll raise a child in the car? Very easy. Do you have a cigarette? What good is there in a child? If there is any, let it be for the parents. They have abandoned it, why should you get involved? Leave it at that. What will happen then? What do you expect to happen? But I am here now ... I was told to write a request. You were told nonsense. Don't write a request. And then? What then? There are lots of bastards everywhere. It's not a novelty. Did you have a share in the pleasure of making it to justify the chore now? I found it. You are just a passer-by. I found it. You searched for it or just found it? It could've been somebody else. Now it's you. All right, so what? Things happen. It could've been a brick falling on your head. Forget it. When this child grows up, if he grows up ... will he go about collecting abandoned children? Well, then. Go and have fun, be happy before you're buried. Are you lacking in troubles? For the price of four bottles of milk you can buy half a bottle of liquor.... Drink liquor You won't drink alcohol unless this baby can drink milk?! Have you got a cigarette? What to do then? What do you think? What? Matches? She's alone. Everybody's alone. We have all these instituions to fill the gap. Where is she? No one is in the courtyard. Go quickly. Where is she? Quick! While there is no one. - Your effects? - What effects? Oh, yes. My stuff. Will you stay here? yes yes I wait in the street? - Yes. Hurry. The battery is used up. Golabgiri* Hadj Mohammad Hassan Aghajani [rose-water maker] - Where is she? - Go on! - In the car? Where's the car? - Walk on. Did she cry much? I was afraid of being alone. Did the neighbors notice anything? How do you get the stuff? - She may catch cold. - Go on. - and if she cries? - Shut up. - And if she's hungry? - Enough. - What do you think? - Nothing, dear. I'm happy. - Don't fancy nonsense. - I ... I love you. Listen, Taji! Stop about her. Understand? Understand? I'm tired I've had enough of your play-acting with a doll. ??? [I have no money. I have no time. I have no patience. I don't want it] ??? I took her to the orphanage. Well? You're satisfied now? You have done wrong. - You have done wrong. - I know what I'm doing. Why? - Why? But why? - Let's go. Have you forgotten? She'd been watching us. We had become three. You suggest I tip whoever sees us making love? Let go! Don't touch me! You dirty ... Don't touch me! Leave me! Shahada [ceremonial burial chants] [Shahada] [Shahada] Well, let's go. Where? We can't stay here forever. All through the day you had left me shut in that room with my dreams I imagined Beautiful things Now you come and snatch them from me. What did I snatch? You're dreaming now. I was dreaming. Is it my fault if you dream? No. It's mine. I was dreaming that you were a man. I was dreaming. At least you learn to be a man. It it wrong to have put her in a place where she is looked after? You mean to say it was by pity and not cowardice? That teaches me how to do good. To do good when it is deliberate and not when you do it unknowingly. You evaded the responsibility... Did I want to find her, or did I find her by chance? It happened to me. If you let things happen to you, you're lost. One is lost, regardless. When you don't have good luck, it's useless. Good luck or back luck are always there. The thing is what to do with them. and you ... What did you do? Me? Poor simple me? I made a mistake. If I had taken things in hand, if I had come, you wouldn't treat me like this. I understood at least little by little.... like that... Be surprised To tell me that I dream! You still do. You dream, my dear! The baby came, and the baby left. the fewer, the better. We're lighter now. the life... with all its ups and downs - What do you know about life? - that's mean: the bad luck ... the traps danger, sickness Not knowing what's going to happen next. doing good and being told it was bad Everybody telling you this and that, but nobody giving you an answer. Go on! Say more! Having no hope being resigned, keeping silent, staying dead. living without knowing how. Nobody giving you an answer. Have you ever answered anybody.. You must first answer yourself Why all this nonsense? These things and these words are not your models Why me? There are lots of other people in the world. There are lots of other people like you ... that's the trouble. Thinking of it, why didn't you keep her yourself? I thought we would keep her together. Why together? Because she watched us being together. She watched us. She did. She won't now. She still does. you must see that. If a heart is offended by a harmful glance, it won't be healed soon. You're dreaming again. - Shouldn't I? - Waking up is what you should do. With the life... ??? "?? ??ϐ? ? ???? To be awake you must dream. Dream then - It's not enough either. - Then do what you want. I want you to take me to her. What? I want you to take me to her. "I want you to take me to her!?!" I'll pay you the fare. - oh hell, one has to atone for ... for the cowardice of others. That's enough. that's not enough. Tomorrow when you're anger's gone... we have to look into each other's eyes, you know? Tomorrow? You have a "tomorrow" always in reserve? That'll be all right. You'll forget. Everything'll be all right. Why should your tomorrow be any different from your today? the sun goes down and a day's over. the sun is up and a day begins. That's how you count your days? How do you know this child was not your tomorrow? You are going to sunset today, Go to search tomorrow Yours, mine ... You know? My tomorrow comes tomorrow. It's gonna be OK Tomorrow that came... it's gonna be OK Poor Hashem! Tomorrow to him is like the lottery day... of those who have tickets. For them it's once a week ... they hold the chance and some win sometimes. While your day ... your lottery... your tickets ... Yes, I Know: I told you, I have bad luck. It's your tickets that are bad. Every day is your drawing day. But your tickets are those of the past weeks. When your anger is gone you'll have to look into my eyes. We can't look into each other's eyes anymore. Don't forget... You've cheated me. Isn't it cheating when you sleep with others? Come to think of it, it'll be cheating myself if I go on sleeping wih you. When you left me last night, I felt bad. I vomited. And afterwards, when you gave me water, I felt better. And I forgot my troubles. I felt clean. and I told myself there is your man, and this will be your life. I thought the child had come to bring us together. Like somebody from the Heavens a new destiny But you, who had brought her to me in the first place... snatched her from me to throw her into some obscure hole. But she keeps looking at me. Now I ... I must go and find her now. I'll come too. I'll come with you. Here we are. I'll come with you. I'm coming too. Listen, Hashem You've done your work You've shown her to me and then, either by mischief or stupidity like a devil, you've snatched her away from me - You're really stubborn. - and you really can talk. Follow me. I've had enough of following. Listen Hashem. Let's get it over. There's no use in patching it up. Suddenly I've realized that you're not the one I wanted. Perhaps you've never been. I've been wrong, but I see clearly now. Let's get it over. Must we really be nasty before we separate? Why should we separate? We have, already. You don't stop talking. I stop. Well, what are you going to say in there? It's in there. I'll wait here. [Baby profile , not legible] Afsane [baby's name] .... Seven days " ... he must serve them ..." and he must consider their problems as his own and try to solve them. It is our willingness towards cooperation and our ability to serve others that should really form the general law and the essential criterion of our behaviour in life. Our interest in fellow citizens, and our sympathy ...to others and our readiness become a deputy and helping others There is no rule more golden, more precious more laudable and more vital than this As the poet has said: "when you see a blind man at the rim of a pit, to remain silent is a crime." What truth is more sparkling that this one: Man must fulfill his obligations towards his brothers. It is solely by this rule that an individual could help the building of a prosperous society capable of providing and protecting the welfare of all. As the poet has said: " thou who doth not share in the pains of others thou art not worthy of being called a Man" Taxi taxi Taxi ?. ?????? E.
