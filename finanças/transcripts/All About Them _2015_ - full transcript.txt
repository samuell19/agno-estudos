- Micha. - Mélodie... So you're back? I was a little worried. Charlotte didn't answer my calls. I just came by to check. - You got in when? - Just now. Come in. I won't interrupt your reunion. - How dumb. - Think I was dead? I was just worried. Okay, I'm ridiculous. Worrying must come with the job. Stay for dinner. Come on, you need time together. Have a nice evening. Sorry again. Are you crazy? - You haven't been together... - In 5 days. I wasn't in jail. This year's traditional July 14th military parade was inaugurated by Malian soldiers. How's work? Same as usual. I don't have a life but I manage. So young. I'm impressed. As if you're old? I hate hearing I'm young. Should I toss this? Know what you do to moribund soap? Wet it and mold it to a new one. That way: no waste, as my mom says. And they're forever melded. A sole and unique being. Like in "The Fly". See it? The fused bar will never be the same. Moving, isn't it? It affects me. Your mental health affects me. Very cute footwear. It's a total love-killer. That bad? As far as I'm concerned. Not that it matters. You like fennel? What were you doing in Poitou? I met a specialist in rivers for a project. On the feminization of fresh-water fish. Their feminization? You mean they sway their hips and grow their hair long? It's serious. What is it? All the crap, the residue of pills in our urine, that end up in our rivers. It reduces male fertility. It's hormonal. I want to work there. The clinic isn't forever. Unless I have no choice. And you, Charlotte? Me what? Are you looking? I'm looking for nothing. Except the horizon. Too bad you quit Bertheleau. I was fired. You didn't really fight it. I'm singing on Friday. At the Boxing Bar. - They pay a little. - Really? I'd like to have known. I told you. You're angry now? Going to the bathroom. Sorry. About what? Coming or staying? Avoiding me? - I had no idea he got back today. - No kidding. 3 days with no news. You were alone last night? - I don't understand you. - Nor do I. Too easy. I'll leave you two. Come on... There's dessert... and fireworks. I work early. - Are buses running? - I'll drop you off. Don't bother. I can always walk. No bother. What's wrong? Are you angry too? I have to pee too. - Mind that I told her to stay? - On the contrary. You okay? Still among the living? Sorry, I'm dozing. Shit... Give me the XX-Strongs. The mints. I'm drunk! - Drunk? - 3 glasses. No cops. I see them all day. Spit it out. It's dumb. Serves no purpose. National Police. Shut off your car. Permit and registration, please. Breathe into this. Excuse me, what driving violation did he commit? Just a routine check. I guess you have orders from the DA to test drivers on this road? Can I have proof, please? You exhaust me. Get going now. You're a madman. I should memorize that DA thing. And the renovations? Not much progress. I'm waiting to save up a bit. I wonder if... If what? It was the right time to buy and go into 30 years debt. Here? What is it? Nothing. Just a little blue. Why? You're funny, despite appearances. Like you know everything, feel everything. What appearances? I don't know. I admire you a lot. I like you a lot. You're too sweet. When did we meet? A year ago? More or less. That's cool. Goodnight... Do we stay like this long? I don't know. I feel good. So do I. Even if you reek of mint. Sorry. It's not because I'm sad or drunk. I always wanted to. Do you realize? Come on. I'm ashamed enough. I won't ask you to keep quiet. You know I won't say a word. Unbelievable... - You can be sad, but... - Stop. I don't need pity too. You move me, that's all. I'm such a fucking idiot. Such an idiot. I'm such an idiot. I'm sorry. Falling asleep thinking of you. Are you asleep? I think this house brings us bad luck. Hasty conclusion... Are you bored? You know I never am. What's wrong? Why must there always be something? Emptiness is ineffable. No describing what doesn't exist. Suicide break, hold on. As long as you come back. "Having your heart "is the only thing "perfectly happy "of which I am proud." Alfred de Musset? Marilyn Monroe. Lying serves no purpose. Especially to me. I thought there was a connection. I thought she smiled at me. There are a few steps before the hand under her skirt. Not under the skirt. That's important. Not under the skirt, on the skirt. I mean... through it. I didn't touch her directly. I touched fabric. Well, that's a start. So explain... What should I say? At the moment, I work in a department store. At work I've been under lots of pressure. I read your file. I don't care. Sorry, but stop justifying yourself. I'm not here to judge you. Explain what happened two days ago. Or it won't go well. I saw that woman going home. I wanted to make a couple move. A couple move? I'm depressed. Will I go to prison? Stop this at once. It's forbidden. Here with me you can cry but not this afternoon. I'll stop crying... The victim is not you, okay? That won't work. At all. If they deport you, act agitated on the plane. Flail about. They can't take off. They'll remove you and who knows? Various associations can help. But no violence. You'd be judged for that too. William! I'll be at court all morning. We'll talk in the afternoon. What a miracle. You picked up. See? Listen, Charlotte... What? I think... In fact I don't accept this. Accept what? Never seeing you. You're the busy one. No... I'm free. I work like a madwoman but I find time. - Both of us have to want it. - I do. No, this isn't wanting it. You don't screw Micha. How do you manage? I'm not out to get laid. But when I love someone I can make love every day because I need it like I need air. I can't believe I'm saying this. It's because I'm too sad... Talking to you makes me sadder. I get erratic. Why this pain? Last night I... What? Why don't you just leave me? It would hurt, but the pain would be pinpointed. And I could try to move on. I think anyone would have done the same thing. You too, Madame Your Honoress. You'd have done the same. Your Honor! I'm a Criminal Court judge, not Madame. You destroyed a car. No, hold on... I told you it was my car too. I paid for it 50-50 with my ex-boyfriend. So I'm allowed to hit it too. It's my object, not a person. No, you're not allowed to hit a car or a policeman with an umbrella. But the person grabbed me violently. I defended myself as any woman defends herself against a man. I didn't see he was an officer. He was in uniform. So what? I couldn't take the abuse, so I defended myself. That's not in the statement. Still I have a bruise on my wrist. You jumped on him savagely. I'm 5 foot 2. He's a big guy, 5 foot 9. Savagely... I have to defend myself. So the police are lying. Encounters can take a wrong turn and it's a fine line between the game of seduction and something dangerous. But this isn't the case. The man I spoke with this morning is not a pervert. This is in the psychiatric report which the prosecutor requested. Without minimizing the pain or the trauma, understandable and undeniable of the victim, without justifying my client I am persuaded the prosecutor is wrong. This isn't a circuit court and I can attest to the fact he wouldn't scare me in the street. Not afraid at all. I am here before you, a 26-year-old woman living in Lille and I know about uncouth, insistent boys. What we have here, it is sad to say, is a gesture of love, which went wrong, made by a man who is terribly and deeply sad, lonely, pathetic and even pitiful. Not answering? Last night haunts me. Your silence too. Sneezes halt bodily functions. Even the heart. Did you ever want to sneeze in court? To stop, you mustn't pinch your nose. Tongue in the roof of the mouth. Like this. Or shut your eyes and rub them, less discreet. What's wrong? You tell me. I got another envelope, bullet inside. - That's crazy. - It's no joke. I know that. You con everyone. So? Nice to see you worry. Who'd have guessed? Should I cry? You're not the first. What do I do? Want to go in hiding? File a complaint. How amusing. Or defend people normally. Don't say you can buy a judge, get kickbacks... I wanted to wait, but it'll get you in a fix. I'm sorry in advance... I can't keep you on. I can't pay you. I may be disbarred. What an asshole. Calm down. The bullet was to make it easier? You owe me 4,000 euros. I'm 3 months behind in rent. I know. I'll reimburse you. Vacate the premises. I'll rent your office. I have no choice. I'm not abandoning you. I asked around for you. But there's good news. I can't take it on if I get disbarred. You'll plead Dordevic's case. Not bad? I'll meet you there. I was at your office. Don't freak out. I'm not going to beg. You okay? Yeah, fine. I came to apologize. Face to face. I fucked up from the get-go. I never should have. Neither of us owes an apology. Hi, Marie. See you tomorrow. Coffee? No thanks. No, don't do a thing. He's your scumbag boss? He's not a scumbag, just a loser. He stole from everyone and thinks he's targeted. That bad? Nothing will happen. Death threats are as common as official forms. You hate lies but I hear 1000 a day. I used to put this job on a pedestal. - Ms. Brunet? - Sit! This is she. I don't know you but my husband wants me dead. He already tried with waves from the microwave. Can I have your name? Marie-Noelle Lambert. I won't lie to you. I'll open a file but there's not much I can do. Write the President. I'll do that and keep you informed. Sure, humoring me keeps me young. I'll be going. Mrs. Lambert, I'll do my best. I have to go. Goodbye. You're busy. If I have to open files for every mental case. I have something for you. For me? Why is that? I bought them during break. - You need socks. - Is this a joke? Sort of, but it's for you. What's wrong? I don't know how to take this. You don't like them? Last time I got socks was from my mom. Ages ago. Sorry... It's a sign of our complicity. To lighten things up. It flopped. No, Micha. Mélodie, I'm off! Quiet. Mélodie... He's locking us in. We'll spend all night. Don't worry. I have the key in my jeans. Fuck. Go look. Why me? Go on... Are you okay? And you? How's it going? Jesus Christ... I don't believe it! What happened? - Who's that guy? - Screw you. Who did this? No idea. I'll take him to hospital. Don't bother. I will. What are you thinking of? The same person as you. Mélodie, we're doomed to being unreasonable. Let's try to forget. It's 9 o'clock! Fall back asleep? Slept badly. Confused. Could think only of you. Meeting like this is silly. I wanted to kiss. I barely have 30 minutes. Not very grown-up. Fuck being grown-ups. What is it? Nothing. Want a drink? Same as you. Looking for a new firm? If only I had time. My grandma sent me a check. I hate it. Feels like I'm 15. What's that dress? What? - What's going on? - Nothing. It's a dress. I treated myself. The treat's for me. Aren't you broke? I bought it a while ago. I thought reselling it would be a shame. Real shame. Invitation to rape. Not nice to talk like that. Bad choice for prison visits. - Stop. - Let me see. Enough. I regret having worn it. What a hypocrite. You want to drive me crazy. 3 days without calling didn't drive you crazy? Wait. I thought you came to kiss. This is how it works? I flee so you come running? That was fast. I found nothing. 3 chairs and a cheap table. It was packed. Everyone pushing. I'm done with flea markets. Damn... - Your face is hot. Sick? - I don't think so. Let me see. Not so sure. Shit, I'm never sick. Give me a hand. Careful. In the center. I'm so fucking thirsty. You're right. I feel ill. What is it? I don't think it's serious. You're shaking. You didn't lock the car. Be careful. Just a sec. I'm hot as hell. Water? I'm fine. Not that way! - I'll get aspirin. - Don't. And thyme infusion. Grannies know best. These chairs aren't bad. All the same. See my phone? Try the car. Why are you here? I don't know. I wasn't far and I saw your car. I wanted to kiss you. Like a sudden whim. Not too grown-up. Fuck being grown-ups. Think so too? I mean, so do I. I really do. You're crazy. Charlotte is right there. Mélodie! Sorry, I'll go. This is so crazy. You're telling me! Go now. I'm sorry. We said no apologizing. I don't think highly of William, but I trust his judgment and my instinct. I didn't expect this. Want to think it over? I want you to start in mid-August. This August? Not in 2036. This is unhoped for, a miracle. At the same time... I didn't intend to leave Lille yet. It's your call. I can't decide for you. Mr. Dordevic is awaiting trial with 15 others most of whom are Serbian. Arms trafficking is clear-cut. If he sets his story straight with the others on parole, justice may never be done. It would be unfortunate... Want to meet tonight? I'm free after all. This hypothesis is serious. The defendants in this case have police records placing them in organized crime's upper-echelons. As usual in such cases, the defence lawyer will play up the image Mr. Dordevic will convey in court if he came a free man rather than handcuffed. We shouldn't worry about Defense's image. Want to meet tonight? Micha has diner for work. Defence? Let's stop with this nonsense. First of all, Mr. Dordevic is a dual citizen. He and his son were born in France. It's been 15 years. A mere detail but it curbs fantasies. For the rest, Article 145-1 of the Criminal Code, which prosecution should reread, forbids renewing arrest warrants after two years of detention. - Want a sandwich? - No thanks. - See you later. - See you. So sorry. Not free tonight. Lots of kisses. I insist! Party 42 rue Jean Bart. Meet me there later. Why are you here? To have lunch with you. You have time? Will you be late tonight? Probably. These dinners go on forever. What will you do? Stay here? I'm too tired to go out. Doing nothing is exhausting. It's not so bad? Ages ago, we met all over, kiss in bars. Sex in stairwells. Not ages ago. Now. You know what I like most? Talking to you. Listening to you. Smelling you. Kissing you, making love, licking. Being licked by you. I like watching you smile, eat, sleep... Let's get married tomorrow. I hate marriage, but if you want I will. We'll have 14 kids. I can't top that. I came home to tell you this. I'm off. Wait. I'm not used to cheating. And not with her friend. What does "not used to" mean? You mean it sometimes happens? No, first time. I'm not like other guys. I have a screw loose. Meaning what? That right now, I'll take you in my arms. And I'll want to do it tomorrow. And the day after. And so on. I think you got it wrong. You still love Charlotte. Not "still love". I love her, period. I always will. We've been together 4 years. But I've never pinned her down. The less I understand her, the more I love her. And the more I think of you. Don't feel like talking? Let's get some fresh air. Where are we going? Dancing. I'll be damned. What? - Don't want to go? - I do. It's not very discreet. Don't worry. A party. You'll know no one. Where is it? Rue Jean Bart. How's the job hunt? Any leads? Not really. Stupid me! Give me the keys. I forgot my bag. Your bag? Does that happen? - Guess so. - Come. Go on in. I'll meet you there. - What floor? - Third. Fuck. - A friend of Micha's. - Raphaël. No way, you came! I think Micha's here. That's impossible. I didn't dream it. He just came. Shit, I told him I was going to sleep. Good you came. Spare us the Friday-night spinster routine. How are you? Not in bed? Not at your dinner? Had a fight with Boris, the intern. They pissed me off. I left. - Anyone drinking? - I'll come. Fucking stressful. It's all fine. Hey, Charlotte! My boyfriend... I'm sorry. You're diabolical. No desire to be diabolical. Life is diabolical. Are you okay? I'm sick of the blur. It's been five months. What are we doing? Where does it lead? Let's get some air. I'm suffocating. - Micha? - Don't worry. Stop. You're crazy. This place looks fun. Let's have a drink. What do you see? I see your eyes. And my burdensome love. Stop it. What I want won't happen. Who knows? I wanted so much with you. Like never before. Like living together. Growing old together. Stuff that never crosses my mind. But you made no promises. You won't leave Micha. I'm so far from him too. But I can't leave him. I know. Should I not tell you this? I love you. I can no longer say those things. I don't care. I say it for both. Watch out in the meantime. Stalin is boogying behind you. Seen Charlotte? - I think she left. - Left? I think so. What are you doing here? We wanted to get away. - You okay? - I looked for you. Let's go back. Hey, dykes! You don't like my bush? What's his beef? What's your problem, asshole? - Say what? - Asshole. You okay? I can't see a thing. I think he killed me. - He didn't. - You sure? Is this me talking? Hear my voice? Feel better? My face is numb. No better remedy. Look at this wounded warrior. It's nothing. A black eye. Manly, totally classy. How did you make him so angry? Get into a fight? Just some drunk's dumb joke. Fuck... Tomorrow is the wedding. I'd rather hang myself. You have a wedding? My cousin in Tardinghen. Good old Mish-Mish. Sleeping with that? Probably. It suits you. Want to sleep here? You okay? Okay then... Goodnight. Door closed? Not asleep? I need to pee. Who is it? The Pope. Who do you think? A little goodnight kiss. I have something to say. With your rent problems, knowing Micha, he'll suggest you stay here a bit. Think so? I'm afraid you will, and I want you to. Not asleep? It's weird you're here. Know what? I can see it coming. Charlotte will ask you to stay till you're on your feet financially. It's not sensible but... How can I put it? If it were up to me... Anyway... I know you'll say no. We'd go crazy. You're naked? So no one is asleep? Anyone want vodka? Is that my phone? Shit... Yes, that's right. 20 minutes. I have to go. - You're joking? - On duty. On duty? As a lawyer I'm on call certain nights. Go where? - A client at the precinct. - So late? No rest for the wicked. - For how long? - It can go fast. Can I take your car? - Coffee first? - I have no time. I'll drive. I barely drank. Me neither. I'm here to see a client. Come in. You were crazy to wait. - It wasn't long. - How was it? I feel sickened. A guy I defended who touched a girl's ass. I got him released and he did it again. This time it's worse. How much worse? Attempted rape. - A nasty one. - Fuck. Will you defend him? Of course I will. It's my job. I can't stand it. I can't stand all this shit. What do I grasp onto? Think of yourself a little. I was offered a job in Paris. I'm afraid I won't see you both. What's the time? Fuck, the wedding! You're leaving me? Just a little. Antoine, do you agree to live in matrimony? Yes. Laurence, do you agree to live in matrimony? Yes. Since you have decided to live in holy matrimony, before the Lord and his Church, now hold hands and exchange vows. Antoine, do you take Laurence as your wife and do you promise to remain faithful in sickness and in health, to love her till death do you part? I do. Laurence, do you take Antoine as your husband and promise to remain faithful, in sickness and in health, to love him till death do you part? I do. May no man separate what God has united. Your "I screwed up" look. Meaning? Is it nasty or nice? Who did that? Not a woman, I hope... Two women. Is Charlotte well? Of course she is. I love you both. Last night, I had a dream. You were so beautiful, I couldn't bear to wake you. I who never belonged to anyone dreamt I gave you one another. You are made for this love and it, for you. I've never liked saying goodbye, farewell or see you. But I promise I'll be careful. Don't be sad without me. You are my life's source and horizon. Your faces, your hands, your scents, voices pulse through my veins. I am taking with me the most beautiful treasure: the memory of these two days. ALL ABOUT THEM!
