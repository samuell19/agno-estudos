(Dramatic Music Swell) a calm sea and prosperous voyage god's answer to the prayerful voyager. but this cruel and possibly evil sea of the florida coast was never meant for man and maybe not for god once known as the devil's sea for its legends abound with unnatural mysteries of disappearance and death we now speak of it in simpler terms this is the bermuda triangle.

it's only 50 miles we can make it a half hour but you won't right how fast will she go frank oh i should do 90 maybe more frank those engines are still a little tight now remember you promised not to

wait a minute now when you left last summer it was goodbye good luck and nobody gets hurt that's the way you said you wanted it and that's the way i played it and you did maybe postcard damn it a lousy postcard postcards letters phone calls they weren't in the rules remember rules are words they're not inscribed in stone you know see my hand works just fine dandy 40 minutes remaining frank about that care to try for 20. lieutenant i i have a blip sir what kind of boat can go that fast i don't know hydroplane maybe plop that speed for me will you for sure it's rule breaking time always happens at weddings people get over emotional is that what it is jen come here hurry it up frank's got himself some kind of did trouble saying what the trouble was i couldn't hear him too clear i did get he wants to talk to you frank come in frank this is jad over the compass man something's wrong what's wrong with the compass frank where am i what is it frank not lying what's the mark what light frank the company it just uh it's gone come right zero one six frank frank mommy we lost radar contact at 21 14 hours i proceeded immediately to the scene notified the rescue coordination center on route they had aircraft with us in 20 minutes we searched all night long it was dark i'm sorry man but we had a clear night and a full moon had there been anything we should have found it by now we're going to keep searching but uh what is it that boat was traveling in excess of 80 miles an hour wrong he was turning 3 500 rpm he couldn't have been going over 40. the quartermaster plotted him at 80 plus on a maneuvering board he's very good at his job lieutenant what do you think happened well like any body of water these days the gulf stream is polluted he probably hit a floating object of some sort lieutenant uh are you sure this thing is working you familiar with radar mr ballinger well i happen to have a little company that builds these things i built this one as a matter of fact it works fine well that's good to hear now what i got trouble with is this if a boat that big hit something there'd be wreckage or some kind of some kind of image on the screen wouldn't there i mean it just wouldn't go out like a light bulb there's another one for the bermuda triangle drop it linder yes sir excuse me son i don't mean to get you into any kind of trouble but uh well lieutenant he watches radar all the time i'd like to get his opinion he's referring to the bermuda triangle harry it's an area off the coast of florida here where ships and planes are supposed to disappear i'm afraid that's a very overworked superstition mr ballinger yeah i've heard about that uh what about that plane that disappeared just last evening a private plane some mechanical failure i'm sure well lieutenant if all this were just superstition there'd be wreckage in the water but there isn't now either there's something to this bermuda triangle stuff when things do disappear or my radar here's all filed up but you say it isn't so mr ballinger there is no such thing as the bermuda triangle is that the official coast guard position it is and it could be your right but what if you're not she didn't want to stay at the house so i thought it was best to let her come down here thanks jill my mommy did not leave me she didn't go away wendy she's out there i know she is mr ballinger i was just looking for you sir oh what's on your mind linda i was wondering sir you're still interested in that bermuda triangle thing well i've got to be curious i'll tell you that there's this professor well he was a professor his name is uh caldis he fishes over there off that brook causeway almost every day he lost his wife off the coast three it's about four years ago now you know uh we never found her nothing not a trace the coast guard just says yeah unexplained things do happen and they let it go with that but not him he wouldn't let it go with that you go talk to him he's going to tell you about seeing white lights and hearing voices strange i mean there's been some weird things really weird things been happening out there yes sir it was four years ago this friday she was fishing alone not more than a half mile from here and she disappeared she just disappeared i'm sorry you uh you lost someone yeah i lost two friends and this morning i heard the fella they were going to visit over on bimini they lost him too yesterday afternoon it's very strange most of these disappearances seem to be happening right around this time of year is that a fact oh it's a fact all right and there's lots more did you ever hear of the marine surfer queen a 425 foot freighter with 39 men aboard lost without a trace no debris no oil slick and not one body recovered of course since world war ii there's been over 100 ships and planes lost and over a thousand people who seem to have just vanished now maybe you could tell me what happened to them i was hoping you could tell me no i i've been out of the conclusion business for some time now conclusions can make a man look foolish very foolish you don't look foolish to me professor well you haven't heard my conclusions you find your reasons and then come back and remember there are records of incidents going as far back as the 1800s you find your facts figure them all out and come back and then we'll talk some more foolishness thanks professor i'll do that oh mr ballinger you remember apollo 12 you know what the astronauts aboard reported was the last discernible thing seen on planet earth the large luminous halo coming off the waters around the bahamas now that's in the exact center of what we now call the bermuda triangle okay i hope you don't mind my interrupting not at all i was curious about your book why well i like them i'm in the boat business this is exactly the same as bank shot two is it not exactly no well uh what's the difference frank was second in the bimini race on this boat last year he didn't like being second so we molded a new hull same as this one put in more powerful engines and redesigned the propellers hi jan harry lieutenant mr ballinger well is there anything new no sir i'm sorry so am i in effect then bank shot 2 was a brand new boat i suppose so yes what's your trouble lieutenant at the speed she was capable of and she hadn't had sea trials yet maybe she didn't hit anything she could have flown apart on her own she didn't mr horn i understand and i'm sorry you designed it you have to feel that way i'm telling you now you listen to me that boat did not disintegrate harry it didn't take it easy tell me something will you lieutenant if his boat had flown apart again i'm asking how come you never found any other not a cushion not a life jacket nothing against her i don't know this is really fascinating stuff ted when you talked to frank last night did he say anything about his compass yes he did what did he say that he was having trouble with it that it was spinning listen to this in 1945 after the war five navy torpedo planes took off from here for a training flight and perfect weather conditions they called in an emergency the tower asked their position and the flight leader said i'm going to quote him we're not sure of our position we cannot be sure just where we are we seem to be lost did frank say anything about his being lost yes yes he did the whole thing judd is that uh these books and articles we've been going over are just filled with things like that i know that harry the stories are around well these planes were lost in broad daylight and then the navy sent out a big old rescue plane to find them and the damn if they don't lose that one too now judge you gotta admit that strange i can't explain it harry dad can i see you please well what is it wendy take me out on your boat please it's important why honey my mommy didn't leave me i heard her i heard her voice please please dad take me out there she's convinced she heard something i didn't want to bring her over here i'm glad you brought her claudia thank you wendy hey would you do me a favor tell me what you heard i heard my mommy's voice you did what did she say she called my name is that all no she told me to hurry where to i don't know where is she well honey that's hard to say we're just beginning to study on all this wendy uh would you go out and get yourself something cool to drink you just want me to leave so you can talk about something that i shouldn't hear donna i'd appreciate it very much if i could have your permission because that's exactly what i'd like to do i want to go out there please my mommy wouldn't leave me like that why don't you go get a cold drink honey the thing is she may have a point what do you mean well the voices people have heard them before there are records of it in this material here they hear the voices of people they've loved who disappeared they've heard the voices and seen strange white lights claudia i think it might be a good idea if we took wendy out and retraced the course all the way to bimini you mean you think if you took her out there and you didn't find anything that would tend to settle her mind that's it exactly well jed i can't go along with that i mean in view of everything that's happened harry maybe the coast guard missed something maybe frank was having problems with his radio maybe we'll find him in bimini i think we owe windy that look is this the place just about yes what do we do just this i don't like it jed please aunt claudia my mommy is here somewhere she's here and she's not dead i watched him take off turned around while i could still hear his engine and then it stopped i looked back and he was gone what happened mr horn i don't know tim you sure you didn't see frank and myra? no sir there's an awful lot of good food and wine aboard that boat. yeah i'll see you. thanks tim do you have any other clever ideas on how to settle wendy's mind? not right now no what do i tell her jed? no more of that triangle business i need something that makes sense maybe there isn't anything that makes any sense maybe there is something to that stuff that harry was talking about i guess you'd have to believe that. i feel sorry for you. why do you feel sorry for me? because you almost died yourself in a boat you designed now your partner has and my sister claudia that boat was sound look i don't blame you for looking for other reasons i can't go along with it though my responsibility to wendy's could be a bit more realistic than that i'm gonna take wendy back to the mainland on a plane i'm sorry jed so i always admired people like frank who could push a throttle to the wall and go full out i never could i would say i was thinking of design limits stress and strain but i wasn't i was scared i was only about three-quarter speed when i tore this leg out what happened unlimited hydroplane i designed for the gold cup i was testing her and she disintegrated under me the point is the bermuda triangle didn't kill frank and myra that boat did well i suppose you can think that way jed if you want to get real extra special hard on yourself harry there's no bermuda triangle i don't know everything i've read up to now that's considered tells me there could be (Dramatic Music) got a problem sir? broken fuel line too bad i sure like to see that thing run you need a tow i'd appreciate it thank you what were you trying to do jed figure out at speed try to find out what happened i was gonna push her to the wall red line prove something the fuel line broke and i'm glad it did all i proved was that i created this thing i'm terrified of it wendy loves florida so much it doesn't seem fair to take her back to syracuse just because it's easier for me what's in syracuse a man modern american emotionally stable type good man president of the chamber of commerce carries a swell golf handicap and he's so boring i shouldn't say that he loves me it can't be all bad harry asked me to marry him last night oh wow well why not i told harry i was gonna think about it why what's the matter the age difference oh no no i don't care about that you know some women are more attracted older men i'm one of them well then what is it well until last night when i told harry differently he thought that he'd found me well that's not the way it was what do you mean i found him see there's this yacht broker in miami and uh he tell me when one of the big ones sold and whether or not the buyers were married see uh i was looking for harry. did you tell him that? yeah i had to i mean i owed him that much you know i even surprised myself i fell in love with the man mommy i'm here. where are you? where mommy? where? (Eerie Music) when i got up this morning her bed was empty and the boat was gone i called you right away as soon as you did we contacted the coast guard now they haven't seen her in the harbor but they put up a helicopter just the same. could she have gone inland? what does that mean well ma'am there's two channels between here and lake okeechobee it's one of them called the north river she used to fish there okay if she stayed in that channel we can find it but there must be 10 15 000 places where she could go up you know one of the glades themselves yeah dad i talked to tim clemons he's waiting for us with the airboat we'll stay in radio contact officer thank you oh this is on the same channel as the sheriff yes sir i'm gonna go over to north river jimmy okay why north river jed? frank and i took her fishing up there one time it's just a guess harry (Boat Engine) mommy where are you? i'm here i'm here mommy i followed you (Eerie Music) mommy i'm here. (Eerie Music) uh roger i have you in sight come here baby we've been looking for you hey how about some breakfast? oh come on honey please wendy uh why don't you and i go down to the dark we'll have one talk huh where's merryweather jill took her out honey where'd she go she looking for me yeah she went out to sea to try to find you but she knows you're all right we called her i went out there because i heard my mommy yeah i know i'll tell you honey why don't we sit down here and talk about that wendy those voices are confusing things this whole bermuda triangle is filled with things you can't understand you know the ancients would go right up to the limits they could explore and then they'd write on their maps beyond this place there be dragons they swore that what they couldn't see was there nowadays most folks wear what they can't see isn't there you don't think i heard my mommy's voice wendy will you think about something for me yesterday evening you told jill you you knew your mama was coming back now last night you went to sleep and you know you dreamed i'm asking you now and don't say anything just think back for me and see if you can't put what you wanted most in this world together with what you dreamed think now wendy think back and remember i'm not much of a substitute mother am i she left so quietly i never even heard her that doesn't make you wrong but now i know why it's wrong to accuse people of things if you care at all you're very busy accusing yourself jed i'm really sorry about those things i said to you i know mommy and frank are dead aren't they i'm afraid so honey and i didn't really hear any voices sad they had to die in their wedding night try not to think about it wendy but i have to think about it to understand it's only sad for me to think how happy they must have been you know what would be the best thing for wendy right now what family will you marry me claudia there was a time i wanted you to say that i just did even yesterday i wanted it you make lovely gestures jed but i can't marry you because it's best for wendy only if it's best for you are you gonna hang me for a sentence no but i'm not gonna hang us for the lack of one i have to decide what's best for me too getting married is a very selfish thing i feel like a man who just stepped off the sidewalk and the street disappeared what do i do now nothing just be yourself so so you know jed i raised a couple of sons didn't have too much trouble i taught him to be honest tell the truth and how to read a corporate financial statement it was pretty easy but now a girl child has to be a whole other thing you know what that wendy said to me after i figured i had her all calmed down and ready to accept she hadn't heard any voices what'd she say i said she'd have to stop hearing the voices otherwise they'd be obliged to call out the sheriff's department every night and that wouldn't be right she's quite a kid isn't she yeah she is you want to be your stepdaddy i'd like to be claudia's in that uh thinking about it stage right now don't that beat all i ask jill to marry me and she wants me to think about it women you know sigmund freud spent 40 years studying them ended up saying what do they want my god what do they finally want you know i figure if he didn't know i sure as hell don't hey masthead there yes sir uh don't float around with my ship to shore ariel please i'm expecting a call no problem sir come on aboard jed it's the weekend we'll have a drink before lunch harry it's tuesday well that's close enough tomorrow i got a child i want to show you fascinating isn't it this is authentic and it's accurate jill and i put it together from all the stuff we've read now every pin is a plane or a boat that disappeared and nobody knows why like right here two brand new air force kc-135 jet tankers gone and right here in miami harbor a little yacht tied up to where moorings disappeared in broad daylight there was even a priest on board a father patrick horgan was his name and right here myra and frank and john borden harry what caused these things give me a reason well jed i'll give you the most popular reason of all see how it sets with you unidentified flying objects the ufos came down and snatched all these things and people away come on harry come on a lot of people believe that you don't all right how about the lost city of atlantis which may be about here you don't buy that nope all right how about all these things we're sucked in attracted to a power source of crystal buried by the ancients sea monsters do you believe sea monsters harry i don't believe any of those things and neither do you i want your reasons come on well jed can you put aside your logic for a time try me i believe there's a door out there call it a electromagnetic or gravitational vortex or a space space-time warp if you want to get halfway scientific about it but i believe there's a door out there the door through which people and things pass to what i don't know that but that doesn't mean it isn't there harry you're a dreamer sure i'm a dreamer jed i started out with nothing but i did a lot of dreaming that's how i ended up with this don't ever trust absolutes boy because yours you know some dreamer will come along and tear them all up for you like 50 years ago you couldn't split the atom that was an absolute some dreamer did it 25 years ago no man was ever going to get to the moon dreamers did it now they say nothing will ever go faster than the speed of light but you want [ __ ] one of these days some dreamer will do it yeah i'm proud i'm a dreamer person is either alive or he isn't a shepheral plane either exists or it doesn't okay jed you're a man who likes to deal with logic i've got some computer facts and figures for you come along with me oh jed i've been putting these figures together well what do you know what is it it's a notes what it is a note from little old gel she must have written it just before she left what does it say what's it say yeah what does it say what do you think it says i don't know what does it say well it's addressed to the great man that's kind of a private joke between us she says i'll be happy to be your wife anytime you say what do you know this is harry here jill where are you jill come here honey it's clear harry please god noah come on 19 degrees you'll be on the reciprocal yes sir i just see a way barry we have to put her down can you do it yeah i think so there's no thinking to it son if we have to put it down we'll do it there i see her put this thing down now well we'll give her a try touch down those belts gentlemen so two down give me the keys harry i'll drive get in the car harry please i don't like you staying alone on board here let's come over to my place oh thanks jed but no this is my home i'm going to stay in it you know jed when jill and i first started are you i was just another old man making a fool of himself over a younger woman but it didn't end up that way no it didn't you go to claudia's son hold on to her keep her i intend to give it a try failures will always tell you how hard they tried don't just try to do it do it i guess uh i sound like a man who's maybe never been scared but i've been scared yet i was scared of jill scared of me with her tennessee williams said it he said the difference between the people in this world and between those who have and had pleasure and love and those who had not the difference between the spectators and the performers if jill hadn't come along i i'd have been a spectator the rest of my life but you did meet her i'll tell you one thing and then i'll keep the rest of myself like a man should or maybe shouldn't tell i don't know but anyway the uh the first time we were together i was scared she knew i was scared but after she she looked at me and said harry ballinger you're a good man not great but good we both laughed and you know jed that was the single dearest thing that ever happened to me i agree with your door and i agree with your conclusion but you might as well drag up a fishing pole and join me we'll be two foolish old men whom no one will believe tell me professor did you ever try to find that door no no not until it was too late what do you mean well i could feel her presence out there somewhere but you know there's scientific evidence that the process of transition is not always immediate i hesitated afraid i suppose are afraid to follow but i don't mean that i could have only that i didn't try until it was too late what happened well she just seemed to fade away while i stood cursing the unknown i'm not ashamed to admit that i cling to this world there's only one thing greater than life another foolish concept love harry gloria so very sorry about you i loved her i know she loved you yeah yeah i know she did honey what are you doing harry i'm gonna take a little boat ride who's going with you i'm going by myself oh harry isn't isn't this too big a boat to take out by yourself it uh it doesn't matter but where's chad he's probably at your place listen harry, how about some company? oh pleased to have you it's always nice to have company on the boat ride any particular place you're going harry just out to see always someplace where there's a door there's one out there somewhere i'm gonna find it (Eerie Music) claudia
