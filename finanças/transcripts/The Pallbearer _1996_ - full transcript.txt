I MEAN, I'M THE FIRST TO ADMIT I HAD A LITTLE DIFFICULTY JUST AS FAR AS... FORWARD MOMENTUM, BUT I'VE HAD A LOT OF JOB INTERVIEWS RECENTLY, AND, YOU KNOW, I DON'T WANT TO SAY ANYTHING, BUT I FEEL LIKE I'M ON THE VERGE OF A REAL BREAKTHROUGH, I REALLY DO, AND I THINK BIG THINGS ARE GONNA HAPPEN.

YEAH, BUT YOU WERE BETTER THAN HE WAS. NO. YOU WERE. I'LL... I'LL GIVE CLIFF YOUNG HIS TRILLS, BUT YOU HAD IT ALL OVER HIM IN THE UPPER REGISTER. HOW DO YOU REMEMBER ALL THIS? I HAVE A REALLY GOOD MEMORY. WELL... I GUESS I WAS ALWAYS SCREWED UP. NO. YOU WERE JUST WORRIED ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE'S FEELINGS.
