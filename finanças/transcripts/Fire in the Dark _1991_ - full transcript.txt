You know what you'll do, hmm? [dog whining] [sighs] Now, try to eat something, dear. I'll let you in tonight, after they're all gone. Judy, please, eat something now. Judy? [telephone ringing] -[glass shattering] -[gasps] [telephone ringing] -Hello? -Woman: Hi, Mom. How ya doin'? Happy Easter. Woman: They're fine. They're doing their morning constitutional... shooting hoops. [shouting] Boy: Come on, Dad. No, no. No, no, we're just running a little bit late. We went to the Dean's house last night for a party and we didn't get home 'til one. Actually, it was after one. Mom. Mom, listen to me. They're dropping hints about making Richard the chairman of the Philosophy Department. Yes! -Hey, Mom. -Good morning. Eric made the Honor Roll again. Now, speaking of rolls... Fill your sink with hot water then, set the bowl with the dough in it. Now, if that doesn't work well, just cuss at it. -I... -Janet... Janet, I spoke to your brother this morning. I'm worried about him, he sounded so glum. See if you can dig it out of him today. Uh huh. [car horn] Oh, my. There's Henny already. Oh, that woman. She'll be 15 minutes early to her own funeral. [laughs] Bye now dear. Hi! Hi! Where is your Easter bonnet? Oh, hold your horses Henny. You're getting worse than Gladys. [tisks] Glady, don't you dare sell your house. You won't be in that retirement place more than one week before you'll be begging them to let you come home and you won't have anywhere to go. Stay at home, Gladys. We'll chain you to the bedpost if you get loony. [chuckling] I know you, Glady. You think you're gonna meet a man in that place. [laughter] She's got her hearing aid turned down on purpose. [laughter] [church bells ringing] Happy Easter, Emily. Oh, same to you, Charles. Oh, Em, you ought to marry him. That old gold digger? Don't mind her, Gladys. She's just jealous. [classical music plays] Honey, it's getting late. I'm really gonna miss this mess when you get that thing published, you know. Seriously, I'm, I'm... Give us a kiss. Hey, the Easter Bunny came this morning. Thanks Mom. Son: Here we go. Cool, Grandpa's watch. -Mother: Looks good on you. -Son: Yeah. Father: Yes it does. Thanks Mom. Okay, we better get moving. -Let's go. -Honey, would it violate your principles if I asked you not to wear jeans today? Son: Why? Well, your mother wants your Grandmother to think that we went to church today. Okay, I'm weak. Okay? That's why I admit it. Listen Mom, I have a chemistry test tomorrow. Would it be all right if I stayed home from Grandma's this once? -No. -[sighs] Son: Why do we always have to go to Grandma's on holidays anyway? Because we do. All right, don't get hyper. I just asked. Mom: Get dressed. ♪ Over the river and through the woods ♪ ♪ To Grandmother's house we go ♪ Will you stop? Come on, stop. You promised. You promised. Yeah okay, we'll stop if you turn off that Muzak. It's not Muzak, that is Simon and Garfunkel. [laughter] That's Muzak. Boy are you dealing with troubled waters. [water running] [humming] Emily: Rob, your sister's here. Coming. Couldn't he wait till after dinner to run the washer? I never saw so much laundry. Look how much Eric is starting to look like Dad! I can't believe it. I gave him the watch this morning. -He's very excited. -He didn't wear it did he? -Janet: Yeah. -He wore it? He wore it. Rob was asking about it. I didn't know what to say. Dad wanted Eric to have it. I know, but Rob is so touchy. Mom, he got so many things when Dad died. How could he possibly feel slighted? I wish you wouldn't be so hard on your brother. I'm starting my PhD this summer. I thought you were going to Europe. No. Not if Eric's going to college. When your father retired he wanted me to stop teaching and travel with him. I kept saying, "Just one more year." "We need the money." "Next year." Well, next year never came. I want you and Richard to see Amalfi together, to see Palermo together. We'll get there. [laughter] The ham is wonderful, Emily. I'm glad you like it. Eric: Yeah, it was great. Richard: As usual. -You forgot the cloves. -Emily: Oh please. Come on, have some eggs. That's sugar, Honey. Be careful. Emily: Your grandfather gave that to me when he asked me to marry him. He couldn't afford a wedding ring then. It was the Depression. [chuckles] My poor mother, she wanted me to marry money. Rob: Oh money. I remember one Easter Sunday your mother's Easter basket was full of goodies and mine had a calculator in it. Now, Dad made the special trip to Marshall Fields in Chicago to get you that calculator. You were flunking math and Dad was pulling his hair out. I flunked math anyway. Now I teach math in high school. Isn't this interesting family stuff? Anyway, after she went to sleep I snuck into her room. Sneaked. Crept silently into her room and I ate every goodie in the basket. He was so sick, I didn't have the heart to punish him. Janet: And I was so angry the next day at school I let all the air out of the bicycle tires. Rob: You did that? You little brat. I gave Buster Thompkins a bloody nose for that. I know you did. That's why I made Tracey Johnson swear in blood she would never tell anybody. [laughter] Is that Dad's watch? Uh, yeah. Looks nice doesn't it? I had it cleaned. Yeah it really does. It's very valuable. Take good care of it. It's really the only thing of Dad's he has, you know. I wasn't asking for it. I think I better check the dryer. Excuse me. Listen, if Uncle Robert really wants it, I mean, it was his dad's. Janet: Uncle Robert just needs to grow up. Something else is bothering him. Mother, he's always been a little jealous of Eric. -You know that. -What a thing to say. Janet: You know how Dad adored Eric. We all adore Eric but Robert is your one and only brother. Janet, please stop this. Eric, try another one of your mom's rolls. Go ahead, we have dental insurance. Ha ha ha. Eric: Actually they're not too hard, Mom. Here you are. Why don't you come in and visit with us for a while? Oh, they were watching television so I... -We'll turn it off. -No, it's okay. Oh goodness, look at the weeds in this yard. Dad would have a stroke, huh? Remember when he used to make us pick weeds? We were always picking weeds, pulling weeds. Yeah. Does Mom seem a little fuzzy to you? Mom? Mom's fine. She'll outlive us all. The house is so dusty. It isn't like her. She'll have her big spring cleaning and the whole place will glisten. You were thinking about going to grad school a while back. -Are you still? -No. You could knock off your masters in no time. Maybe teach college, still have your summers. Teach college? Like you and Richard? Yes. It's funny, I thought when Dad died I wouldn't have to hear that anymore. You know, Eric was really happy to get that watch. Would've meant a lot to me too. I guess Dad didn't want me to have it. Rob, I know you and Dad had your moments and it wasn't fun but don't you think it's time you let go of it? For your own sake. It's not the watch. It's the principle. How do you think that made Eric feel? All right, all right. [sighs] That woman you're dating, Mary? I like her. Yeah, I like her too. She's getting married. Well, there's a lot more fish in... Jan, I know you're trying to be helpful. I'd rather you wouldn't meddle, huh? Okay. It's a little cool out here, anyway. I'm going to go in. [crowd on TV cheers] TV Announcer: Forty, fifteen. [Emily snoring] [Emily snoring] TV Announcer: Forty, thirty. [crowd cheering] [whispering] Mom. Oh. What time is it? After five. We have to go. -Where's Rob? -He's out in the back. You come and go so fast. I'll have to start making lists. I'll be remembering things I wanted to tell you for two weeks. Well, you know our phone number. I hate to see you go. Emily: Bye. Bye, bye. -Janet: Eric? -Eric: Bye. Richard: So long. Thank you. You bet. Bye. You avoided your sister the whole time they were here. She's got her family. I want you have each other. We have each other, Ma. Mom, my car needs an overhaul. Could you let me have 500? Well, yes of course, dear. But uh, this will have to be the last time. I don't want to strain you. No, no. There's no strain. You must learn to be more careful with your money. Yeah. I will Ma, honest. Want to take some food with you? No, no, no. Do you want some coffee? No, no, I'm fine. I'll call you through the week. No, you won't. [Rob laughs] Bye! Oh, Rob! You forgot the cake. It's your favorite. Keep your eye on the ball. Attaboy Rob, hmm? Father: Don't stand on the plate. And get that bat off your shoulders. Ready? I don't wanna play. We've been out here long enough. Okay, if he doesn't practice he won't make the team. But you make him feel so bad every time he misses. Look, I don't care if he isn't Joe DiMaggio I just want him to try. He won't try. Robbie? Come on, let's give it another shot, okay? -Get down. -I don't want to. All right, stay up there and pout. Come on, Janet. My turn. Something wrong? Uh, no, I was watching the sunset. I'll be with you in a minute. Well, be quick about it. We gotta pick up Gladys. Now, where's that purse? [car horn] What do you suppose is taking her so long? I'll bet you a doughnut she can't find her purse. [screams] Henny: Hi. Em. You're okay, Mom. They pinned your hip. You're as good as new. I fell. So far. You were very lucky. That's a long stair. Hit my head. Then the lights... went out. Kept... falling. Falling. Into darkness. I thought I'd died. And the light came back. Here I am. Well you can quit trying to die. The doctor says you're fine. Judy. Oh, did anyone feed Judy? No. We've been here night and day, waiting for you. How are you feeling? Well, I'm still here. [laughs] Mom, I have to go see the doctor, and then I will go by and I'll feed Judy and I'll be right back. I promise. No. Henny can do that. You go home. Don't be silly. [Emily groans] Henny. Where's Rob? He was here. We sent him home to get some sleep. You can get that gerbil food out of here. I brought her supper. Don't look at me like that. My mother-in-law built this hospital and my husband was chief of staff for 34 years. [laughter] Doctor: Janet, the broken hip wasn't the result of the fall. In all likelihood the fracture occurred naturally and caused your mother to fall. Naturally? She twisted her hip and it snapped, before she fell. Her bones are pretty brittle. Most Caucasian women her age suffer from osteoporosis to some extent. How soon will she be able to walk? I mean really walk? It's impossible to say. Now, barring complications, I can let her out in a week providing she responds well to physical therapy and assuming you plan to provide some help at home. Oh, certainly. Good. She's probably going to need some degree of home care from here on in. From here on in? A mother falls down the stairs and all of a sudden she's old? Intercom: Doctor Kankay please call the operator. Doctor Kankay please call the operator. She's coming to my house. It's all decided. Oh no, Mom. You're gonna come home with me. No, no. You have classes to teach, a husband, a son. I don't want to burden you that way. Not only that, you'll spoil her. -I know what she needs. -[laughs] I've already made arrangements to take next week off. Emily: No, no. This is easier all the way around. I took Judy to the vet. She hates that vet. The Gustavsson boy, he can feed her. The Gustavsson boy got married and moved to Maine. We went to the wedding. Mom, Judy's sick and the vet wants to put her to sleep. Oh, no. No, no, no, no. Janet: It'll be all right. It's really the best thing for her, you know. Right. Fine, fine. Try and get some sleep. Janet: Good night. Henny: See you tomorrow. [Emily dreaming] But I don't want a puppy, Arthur. Somebody dumped the poor thing in the alley behind the drugstore. I couldn't just leave her. There'll be hair all over the place. It'll ruin the upholstery and I don't have time to train a puppy. But you'd have her if anything happens to me. Nothing is going to happen to you. Em, I've already had one heart attack. I may not be so lucky the next time. Please, don't be so morbid. I don't want a puppy. We'll keep her till I can find her a home. Well, then put her down in the basement. [dog whimpers] Aw. Aw. Aw, she's trembling. Aw, I'll give her some milk. Make sure it's warm. I'm calling her Judy. [laughs] Judy. Oh, Judy, Judy, Judy. [bell dings] -Woman: We've got you. -Man: Are you ready? All the way up now. Woman: Easy. -Man: Push on my hand. -[Emily gasps] Man: Good. Emily: It's too soon. I can't. Get out of that chair! Who let her in? You stop feeling sorry for yourself and get out of that chair. Take my hand, come on. Up. Come on. Good. Let her go, she can do it. -It hurts. -Oh, sure it hurts. I feel the same every morning when my arthritis kicks in. Man: Come on, all the way. Good. Don't baby her. She'll eat it with a spoon. I will not. Man: Take a step. One more. [laughs] Man: Straighten up just a bit more. Henny: Yahoo! She'll be jitterbugging by the fourth of July. Oh, throw her out. That damn doctor. Making us sit around till noon. I'll cancel my hair appointment. Oh no, you go ahead. I'll get Mama something to eat. What about Eric's track meet? Well, I've already missed it, Mom. Here. Wait a minute, let us help you there. They showed her what to do in the hospital. [Emily gasping] Here. One, there. Sit down for a minute. It's so nice out here. Why don't I just bring your lunch out here? We could have lunch on the porch, huh? -[gasping] -Sound good? [gasping] What am I gonna do, Henny? Don't blubber in front of her. I've heard you blubbering. You've done your share of blubbering. You might as well enjoy this. I fully expect you to wait on me hand and foot if I ever decide to get old. Get me a tissue from my purse. Get it yourself. What a mean old snake. When I get rid of this cane I'm going to kick you from here to the corner. [laughs] You call me if you need anything. -Anything. -Yes. All right now, go ahead. Go. Why don't you take a couple bites before I go. -I'm not a child. -I know, I just want you to eat. All right. I'm eating. Now go. Okay. Why don't I bring the phone out? Would you like me to bring the phone out here for you? Please. Go. I love you. Jan! I dropped my fork. Well, I'll just have to take it in and rinse it off, then. Hi. -Eric: Hi Mom. -Hello, Honey. They kept us waiting for hours at that hospital. And then Mom was so depressed I just couldn't leave her. So who won the track meet? -We did. -Janet: Congratulations. Thanks. [laughter] What's going on? Well hey, if you'd been there you'd know. What? I broke the school record for the 400. Eric, that's wonderful! That's great. Congratulations. He was beautiful. And now he has to go and have his picture taken for the newspaper. Right. Mom, you should've been there. It was something. -I'm so proud of you. -Thank you. Okay, I gotta go. We'll see ya. -Richard: Have a good one. -Eric: Thanks! Janet: Aunt Henny went off to get her hair done and Mom started crying. Richard, I've never seen her like this. She's really a mess. Do you have any idea how your son felt when he realized you weren't there today? It's simple physics, I mean, I can't be in two places at one time. I know. I'm sorry. It's just that ever since your mother fell you been so wrapped up in her... We miss you. I miss you. Yeah. Well, at least now she's out of the hospital. If anybody's going to get her up on her feet in record time, it's going to be Aunt Henny. So, Jonathan comes home from the war sporting a mustache and my mother-in-law says to me, "I can't stand that boy's mustache." Well, I looked her straight in the eye and said, "Well, Ethel, I can't stand yours either." [laughter] Oh! My trick. [jeering] You dirty underhanded dog. -Where did you hide that trump? -[laughs] What kind of medication are you on anyway? Maybe I should have a dose. [laughter] Excuse me. Henny: What, again? She laughed so hard she had to... I hope you make it. [laughter] I'm going to have my bedtime nightcap. You want one? I have to take my medicine. And just where do you think clean living is going to get you at your age? Do you ever feel like you're drifting away? What? What are you talking about? I don't want to give up. I want to go on and on. The medication is doing this. I don't want to give up. I want to go on and on. I heard you the first time. You're going to have a nightcap with me. You need to relax, you need to rest. And tomorrow we're going to have something done about your hair. You look like Mother Time. Henny... You just keep going, don't you? I'm running scared sweetie. I always did and I always will. What do you want, bourbon? What's the matter? Are you afraid of dying with liquor on your breath? [laughs] [humming] Henny, I don't want a drink! [whistling] Henny. Oh, God. No. No. No, no, no, no, no. Minister: I am the life and the resurrection. The light of world by whom all believers shall not perish but find everlasting life. She never had a sick day in her life. She never saw the end coming. That's the best way, Jan. I think you should come home and stay with us now, Mom. I have to get on with my life. Well then, we'll bring someone in to stay with you. No. I'll manage. Take it from me, Grandma, you do not argue with Mom when she uses that tone. [laughing] All right, there we go. Eric: Okay. I'm going back upstairs in two weeks. -About the yard-- -I'll get somebody this week. Okay. I'm gonna call that home care agency. Emily: I'll call them in the morning. -Eric: I'll get sheets. -Richard: Okay. Is that bed comfortable? It is to me. You were both conceived on it. Well, I think we better get the night stands. This is strange. I always wanted a bed-sitting-room. [lawnmower running] [gasps] [phone ringing] [phone ringing] -Hello. -Robert: Hi Mom. Oh Rob, yes dear. -Rob: How you feeling? -Oh fine, fine. It's really good to be home. Robert: What are you doing? I'm hopping around, doing all kinds of things. Robert: Great, I thought I'd come over tonight. Oh that would be lovely. And I'll make a London Broil? -Robert: Terrific, when's good? -Well anytime, dear. Come any time. -Robert: Okay, I gotta go now. -Bye. [knocking] Just a minute! Yes? Look here, my mower don't cut grass this thick. Well, if you were here last week like you were supposed to... I really need the grass cut. Can you get another mower? I doubt it. I'll see. Thank you. [heavy breathing] [phone ringing] [phone ringing] [phone ringing] [phone ringing] [phone ringing] Coming, I'm coming. [phone rings] -Hello? -Robert: Hi Mom, it's me. -Oh Rob, yes. -Robert: I can't make it. Oh well, of course I understand. Robert: There's this PTA meeting I forgot about. Well, maybe sometime next week? Robert: Yeah, we'll see. -[Emily mumbling] -Robert: Is something up? You sound upset. Oh, no, no, nothing's the matter. I was just, uh, napping. Robert: Okay, you look after yourself. Yes, all right dear, bye. -[sizzling] -[screams] [crying] Oh boy, do I wish you were here. We're having some people from Richard's department in. I have to feed them all. Mom, how's your new housekeeper? Oh well, you know I don't like to have strange people in my house. The Dean is coming tonight, Mom. Richard's all in knots. We're hoping he'll announce his promotion. I'll cross my fingers for you. -I shouldn't have called her. -Yes you should, go on. -Um. -Is everything all right? Oh, it couldn't be better. I'll call you in a day or two. Bye. She's having a dinner party. I shouldn't have bothered her. Then call Robert. Let's not talk about this. I'm not going crying to my children. Don't do that. At least let me water the plants. Oh my God. -Em! -[sighs] She just didn't sound like herself. Honey, you just worry too much. You know what? Let me help you. -You think I'll ruin this? -No. I just thought that if I help you we could find a little time for ourselves later on? I'll tell you what, you chop-- You chop those onions over there and you're in. Where are those onions? -Onions? -Go on. ♪ Should you have a question about my direction [phone ringing] ♪ I'm gonna answer you right here and now [phone rings] "♪ I'll be your baby, I'll be your best friend" -Hello? -Gladys: Janet? This is Gladys. Honey, I don't mean to meddle, but you've got to have a talk with her. She's hiding a lot of things from you. She's going downhill fast. Robert hasn't been there all week. She never called a housekeeper. She hasn't eaten and the place is a wreck. Richard: Send Rob over there. He's no help, you know that. Honey, we're expecting twenty-five people for supper. You can't go running off. -You can't. -Everything's ready. Honey, you just talked to your mother an hour ago. -She said she was fine. -I know. I also told that something really didn't sound right. Okay. Can't it wait till the morning? Look, I'm all she has to depend on. You don't seem to understand that. I don't understand the emergency. Gladys said that she hasn't even washed her hair this week. Now something is wrong. If that means that you've gotta dump a bottle of peanut oil into a fondue pot by yourself I'm not going to feel bad about that, okay? So don't panic. I will be back in time. Okay. [water running] So why didn't you call that home care agency? Emily: You just don't understand. You're coming home with me, Mom. Emily: I am not helpless. Well, if you let yourself go much longer you're gonna be. Now, up you go. What have you had to eat today? None of your business. I want you to come home with me until your hip is better. You don't have any room. Mother, it's a four hour round trip. I cannot check in on you every day. Let's pack a bag. I'm staying here. Everything I have is here. Everything I love. And you're not taking me away from it. Man: Come on. Come on. [dog barking] Hey! What's wrong? Well if you'd been to see your mother lately you would know. -Rob: What? -The place is a pigsty, she isn't eating, she can't pay her bills and she can barely get around. You're kidding. No, we have to do something. Jan, she's just down about Henny and this hip thing. She'll snap out of it. She needs to be looked after, Rob. Well, all right, all right. I'll go over after school tomorrow afternoon. Why don't you pack a bag and go stay with her? [laughing] Come on, she'd drive me crazy, Jan. Well then you and I are just going to have to come up with some money for a housekeeper. I am a schoolteacher for crying out loud. I don't have any money. Well what do you suggest? She has income. As soon as she's back on her feet she'll be fine. There's no reason to panic about this. This is my problem? Is this what you're saying? Well let me put it this way. You went off to Northwestern in your red Olds convertible. You spent your summers at your riding camp. I went to State and my summer enrichment program was opening crates at the old family drugstore. I cannot believe you're still throwing this stuff in my face. -You're 45 years old. -Rob: I'm sure, I'm sure. All the same it is pretty clear our father intended to make it your problem. He sure didn't give me the means to do anything about it. And let me tell you something. We joke about those Easter baskets -but that's where it started. -Oh right, oh right. Don't forget my acute appendicitis. You must've been reeling when that one happened. Look. You and Richard have means that I don't have. You want Richard to pay for this. Yeah well if he hadn't looked down his nose at me from the moment he met me I'd feel bad about that. Brother dear, you are taller than he is. If you'd been standing on your own two feet he wouldn't have been able to look down his nose at you. Listen, Janet. If I move in with her she'll never let me move out. Janet, you can't expect that from me. Jan! Janet! [group chattering] Mom, nice of you to stop by. Those have to go in the oven for ten minutes first. And the crudités, you didn't put those out? Did you put the nuts out? Anything? -No, I did not. -I will do this. You go visit with the company, okay? Wait, wait, wait. So how's it going? How do you think it's going? You didn't even chill the dinner wine, Richard. I don't believe you. Eric, will you put that wine in the freezer compartment? Yeah, yeah, yeah sure. Dad is really ticked. And put the fondue pots on the table. Make sure there's enough ice at the bar. Eric: Okay. Those dinner napkins. Where in the hell are the dinner napkins? [Richard chuckles] What are you grinning about? The Dean wants to make an announcement. Oh Honey, that's great. -How 'bout that? -All right! [laughing] You need your head examined. I'm not ready to lie in state in the parlor. Janet will have a fit. I can't sleep down here. How am I going to get better if I can't sleep, hmm? And this... This is going in the junk heap. Where it belongs. Em... I... I had a letter from the Riverview Retirement Center. They have a room for me. That's right. Throw up your hands. Well I'm dying on my feet like Henny Dutton. It's not a thing we can choose, Emily. You're missing a button. Are we getting my hair done or not? Voiceover: "The night is deep and oddly calm. The Germans have finally retreated. How strange not to wonder what lurks in the dark. Not to wait for the inevitable scream of rocket fire. I can sleep now and dream of the life we will have." -[cat hisses] -[dog barks] Radio: W ith temperatures now in the mid 50s. Tomorrow we can expect some late afternoon thundershowers with temperatures ranging from 75 to 85 degrees. [sighs] [door creaking] Who's there? Ah! [screaming] Shhh! Where's the purse? The chair. Now, the rings. [gasps of pain] Shhh! [police radio] I appreciate your concern. [police radio] -She's all right. -Has she seen the doctor yet? Yes. Did she get a look at the guy? Well, she thinks it's the man who came to cut her lawn. Oh, God. Where did you find this guy? Well, he was just a name in the paper. Well the police want to know. Yeah, yeah, well I'll see if I can dig it up. Rob, I'm going to take her home with me for a while. Yeah, okay, okay. Mom. Mom, I'm really sorry. -These things happen. -I know but... Janet: Anybody want some more coffee? -Me. Please. -Yeah, I'll have a cup. Emily, it's pretty obvious you can't stay here by yourself. We'll talk about this in the morning. Sure Mom. Good night now. -Richard: Good night. -Good night. I'll be up in a little while. Richard, if she leaves, she'll be afraid when she comes back. We'll get her some lights in the yard, some decent locks and some kind of an alarm. -You can't be serious. -I am serious. You don't have anything to say about it. I think he does, Rob. -Thank you. -We'll get her another dog. -Are you nuts? -No, I'm not nuts. I should've insisted she come stay with us a month ago. No, no, no. It was my fault. It was my fault. I should've been here. I'll come back, I'll move here for a week or two. And then what? Jan, if you take her away from everything she knows and loves she'll give up. She looks worse now than when she did when she came home from the hospital. If you two want to force her out of here against her will I don't want any part of it. Just what the hell were you a part of, Rob? I don't have to take that from you! You're not part of the solution. Emily: Stop this! [screaming] Mom? Mom... Come on, I got you. [panting] Darn it. Janet, I don't want any fighting. No fighting, do you hear me? You gotta let us help you, Mom. And I don't know how to do that unless you come home with me. All right. It's not the end of the world. It's just for a little while. I can't fight you, Janet. I'm too tired. It's gonna be fun having you around. Such a battle, being alive. Lie down at night, close your eyes, and add up your wins and losses, get ready for tomorrow's onslaught. But when the years... In spite of all your efforts, when the years are out in front... Now what do you do? You let me worry about that. Mama. So, we'll just move all the things you use every day. -Okay? -Fine, but I want my books. Yeah. I'm sorry, Eric. We only have one downstairs bedroom. Why can't she go to live with Uncle Robert? He lives alone, he's got an extra bedroom. This is something that your mom feels that she has to do. [sighs] We've got to back her up. Okay? All right. Okay Mom, you're all packed. What are you doing? Putting my mother's china in Rob's storage locker while I'm away. Well if you're worried about it we can take it. No, no, it's no problem, really. Did you give him Grandma's china? He's just keeping it for me. Oh mother, you know good and well if he gets in a bind he'll sell it. I don't know any such thing. You don't know anything when it comes to your golden boy. Emily: And thanks so much for coming. Did I tell you I sold my house, Em? She didn't sell her house, she gave it to the first buyer. When are you leaving, Gladys? Saturday. Now listen, it isn't even forty miles to Riverview and when you get home you call me and I'll come down and I'll stay a week or so. I don't hug, Em. You know that. Write me, Gladys. Oh! You'll be back in no time. She looks awful. I never thought she'd give up. Not her. We're never gonna see her again. Get in the car, I'll take you home. We're in my car, Gladys. Now get a move on. I have to get back to the library. [car horn] Hey Grandma. -Hi Miss Stanton. -[kissing sound] -Janet: Come on over. -Richard: Hello Emily. -Richard: How are you? -Janet: Eric? Will you and Tommy get the bags? Eric: Yeah. -Emily: Don't fuss, don't fuss. -[coughing] Take it easy. Take it easy. Here, you're losing your purse there. Thank you. I've got you. Hi. This is a lot of stuff. Is she moving in? I don't know. They gave her my room. She can't make it upstairs. Richard: I've gotcha. You can't fall. I hope I never get that old. -Eric: Thank you. -Man: Thank you. Thanks. Bye bye. -This is good, this is better. -Janet: Smooth. -Flip it to manual. -Oh you little stinker, ah! Watch this you little rascal. Hey, I'm a natural. You're not gonna have to worry about pushing me around when my time comes. Don't even joke about that, Mom. I have to, Honey. My mother's probably going to spend the rest of her life in one of these. Eric: Okay. Now, it's just so you can go to the park on pretty days. I'm not a cripple. Janet: It's a long way to the park. Two blocks. If I can't manage two blocks what's the point in going? Come on, Grandma. Let's see what this baby will do, huh? I have things to do. Why's she so crabby? This is hard for her, Honey. It's not exactly a picnic for the rest of us. [alarm beeping] I didn't sleep last night. Go back to sleep, Honey. I'm just going to take Mom out for about 15 minutes. But I'm awake, Janet. I'm awake and I'm awake. Janet: Now, why don't you walk for a minute? No. I can't. Give me a break. Sorry. What are you doing? I'm trying to get some work done. Did you pick up the laundry? Oh, Hell. No wonder I couldn't find my green blouse. Okay so crucify me, Janet. You've taken care of the laundry for the last 18 years. I'm not used running all these little errands. Well you're gonna have to iron yourself a shirt. All right, I can iron myself a shirt. -Janet: Good. -I know how to iron a shirt. Morning. I have a committee meeting this afternoon, Eric. I'd like you to come straight home from school, okay? I have to work on student council campaign after school. Honey, I need you to take Mom out for a few minutes before it gets dark. I can take myself out on the porch. Mother, when I ask him to do something I expect him to do it, okay? Eric, don't wolf down your food like that. It's bad for the digestion. For God's sake Emily. The boy's 17 years old. Whoa. Since when do we defend him for eating like a horse? Could I see you for a minute in here? Janet, when we decided to bring your mom here we said that we would make as little change in Eric's routine as possible. I asked him to take her out for five minutes. Okay. What about us? I wish you would understand. If you would try-- Honey, we're all trying. But it doesn't make sense. It's not working. I will cash in my retirement. We can build another room on the back of the house with a bathroom, a big one. You know she could have her own sitting room. Honey, what if your mom has a heart attack or she has a stroke, or god forbid she falls down and breaks her hip again. Who's going to take care of her? -We can't say what will happen. -She'll need much more than what you're giving her now. -Where will you draw the line? -That's not up to me. Honey, you did not make your mom old. You can't fix it. You have to accept it. But that doesn't give me the right to throw her away. [sigh] Janet, your mom's miserable. She doesn't want Eric's room. She doesn't want you waking up in the morning to bathe her. The poor woman has enough to feel bad about without forcing her to impose on us. I will not abandon my mother. You really think that if you sacrifice yourself she'll lay a wreath of laurel on your brow? That's not true. Richard: You want to be her favorite. This is your last chance and you're afraid that if you force her to face facts she'll hold it against you. Honey, is it really worth all of this? Be my favorite, hmm? Hi, Mom. How's everything? -Good. -Eric: That's good. Need any help? No, I can get it, thank you. Mom, you know Tommy's folks? They're nice people, right? Yes, they're very nice. Well, Tommy's brother is away at college now and they have an extra room and his mother said it would be cool if I wanted to sort of hang out in it for a while. Move out? Sort of, yeah. I mean it's just up the street. No. Please. I said no. Emily: I told you the swans wouldn't be out. Janet: So the swans aren't out. It's still pretty. Emily: It's hot today. Janet: Why don't you take your sweater off? Emily: All right. Janet: Why don't we sit and talk for a minute, okay? Emily: Maybe I'll hear from Gladys today. I've written her twice. Mom, I think it's time we make some plans. Plans? Yeah, for you. I'm way ahead of you, dear. I invited Gladys to come and live with me. I'm sure she's just miserable in that old age home. Selling your father's car and using the money to paint the house. I don't think that's very realistic, Mom. That's for me to decide. You need more help than Gladys can give you. I'll be the judge of what I need. Mother, you are never going home to live. I know exactly where this is leading and the answer is no. I am not living in some dingy room in a... death house with some sweet sounding name. I know that you're upset. This is difficult but we need to face some facts. You're taking the rest of my life away from me. We're trying to help you. Help me? Right into the next world. That's not true. Then take me home. And I don't mean your house where it's perfectly clear that I am not welcomed. I'm sorry, Janet. I'm sorry. I don't want to hurt you. I still see what you're trying to do but oh my God, my God, I want to go home. I want the rest of my life. Please. Please. Let me go home. I just can't do that. Forty years ago... I could have children. Twenty years ago I could read all night and get up and teach all day. Five years ago I could drive a car. Last Easter I made dinner as usual and now... look at me. I'm... You can't understand this. And why should you? It's like... stars... going out... and I'm in the dark... reaching. My God, it's all unraveling. Oh my God. I can't stop. Mom, I'm gonna be right here with you. I'm gonna be right here. -Janet: Hi. -Rob: Same to you. You look good. What's this Mom's telling me about a nursing home? Yeah well, I've looked at a few. The ones I like are so exorbitant. I know, but a nursing home, Janet... That's pretty drastic. I know but I can't take care of her anymore. She can't take care of herself. When did she start using the chair? She doesn't need it all the time. -She looks so-- -She's okay. Emily: Rob! Hello, Rob. Hi Mom. -Emily: Oh. -Rob: Oh! How are ya? Is that jacket warm enough? It's fine. I say it's a little chilly out here. -I think I'll take Mom inside. -Okay, I'll be right in. All right, Good. My God. She's very excited about your visit. Thank you. What is it? She's so... Janet: Old. I know. It happened so suddenly. Yeah. I can't take care of her anymore. Yeah, I know, but a home? Poor Mom. It's the best thing. Yeah. I just take it all for granted, you know? Don't have any food at my place, come over to Mom's. A little short of cash, Mom'll bail me out. The laundry piles up, she'll give me a hand. I've never really left home, have I? Well, maybe it's time to buy a washer. Yeah, or marry one. God, you're hopeless. Hopeless. Woman: We can put her on the waiting list. Well, the one place I like is very expensive. Would Medicaid pay part of it? No, Medicaid covers basic nursing home care for people who have very little resources. Woman: You said your mother has some money and some assets. Yeah, but she's not rich. What about health insurance? Medicare. Medicare isn't much help if she ever needs a long term hospital stay. Well, what do you suggest? See if her church sponsors any type of elder care. Most of them do. If she were childless or destitute I'd have a lot more to offer. Unfortunately, we live in a society that leaves elder care to the nearest living daughter. I'll check with the church. Thank you. What are you doing? Polishing silverware. Mom. I saw the most wonderful place today. It belongs to the church. I really think it's the one. It's just beautiful. We can give them a lump sum from the sale of your house and they'll guarantee all your expenses for the rest of your life. Is there a room in the basement where you sit and glue scenes from nature into conch shells that light up? I'm going to take you to see it on Saturday. I have to teach at 1:00, so if you need anything I will be in my office after 2:30. [birds singing] Janet: Impressive, isn't it? Emily: You said it was pleasant. Janet: It's very pleasant. Where's the dungeon? We call this the sun room. You can read, write letters, or just rest if you want. We have all kinds of lectures and musical events. A lot of our residents play instruments. Janet tells me you play the piano, Mrs. Miller. Oh, my husband was the musician in the family. Oh, Catherine, this is Emily. Oh, I hear that you're a bridge player. Not for years now dear. Catherine's writing a book, on uh... What's it on, Catherine? Innate differences between men and women. All the art you see is done by the residents. We have a painting studio and a woodworking room. In fact, we put on quite a crafts fair every fall. The residents rooms are on the second floor. Well, I can't manage stairs. Then let's take the elevator. Well I have a million things to do at home. Would you rather come back another time? -Yes. -No. All our residents are here because they choose to be. I've never taken anyone against his wishes. Have you really thought this over? May we please just see the rooms? Is that all right with you, Mrs. Miller? Oh, all right. [ringing] -Ruth: Hello? -Ruthie, it's me, Em. Ruth: Emily. It's good to hear your voice. We've got a new librarian. He wants everything on computer. I told him this morning, I said, "You're not going to computerize me, Buster." I was thinking of coming to visit you. Oh, well. Not just now, Em. They want to put me away. I thought maybe if I got out of their hair for a while. Ruth: I've got Gladys here. Emily: I've written her twice, she never answered. Well, her daughter has all those kids. And they kicked her out of that retirement place. Emily: Kicked her out? They found Alzheimers. That place won't keep people with Alzheimers. Well, that settles it. I'm going home and Gladys is coming to live with me. Ruth: Oh, no Em. You don't understand. She almost burned the place down. We're trying to find something for her. -I don't know-- -Who is it? I have to watch her every minute. She's in and out. I have to unplug my stove when I leave for work. Who is it? It's Emily. Emily! Em? Hello Gladys. Oh, Em. It's very bad. Ruthie yells at me. Are you coming home? Gladys, tell me. What happened? Well I just couldn't get used to it. It was so different and they had so many rules. I left a pot on the stove. Gladys: Twice. They say I'm crazy. You're coming to live with me and we'll get someone to come in part time. Oh yes, Honey. Yes I-- Gladys? Don't talk to me like I'm a damned dog! What? Oh. Who is this? Emily: Gladys, it's Emily. Well, see what Henny says. Em, she runs away. I'm trying to get the county to take her. Don't tell her that. Don't you tell her that! What? Gladys: Who... Who are you talking to? Who are you talking to? Go on into your room. Ruth: Now just go! I keep calling her daughter but she won't come and get her. I hate to put her on the county, Em. But it's all I can do to keep going, you know? Why use up the last bit of strength you have to fight it? I mean, what did we think it would be like at our age? Sunsets? You can't stop that. What can we do, Ruthie? Ruthie, what can we do? Oh I don't know, I don't know. Why don't you walk a little bit, Mom? It'll be good for ya. No, not today. You know, we are very lucky. Some people have to wait years to get into a place like the McLinden Home. I'm trying very hard to see it that way. Well, try harder. Well, maybe I'll get lucky and die before I have to go. Janet? I want to go back now. You know how to work that thing. No I don't, I forgot. Well, walk. No. I can't. I have done everything I know how to do for you. I have helped you in every way I can possibly think of. But you just sit there. You sit in that chair and you give up. You've just given up. Well I'm sorry. -Do you love me? -What? -Do you love me? -Janet, please. -Answer me. -Of course I love you. Then why have you made this so difficult for me? I don't know-- Why have I spent my whole adult life trying to get you to notice me? You stopped needing me long ago. No! I will always need you. Don't you get that? Well, look what's ahead for me. I am. I'm looking straight ahead and I see it. Every time I look at you I see it. That's why every single moment we have together is so very precious to me. Janet, at night when I go to bed I close my eyes and I try to let myself go. I say to myself, "It's okay, Emily. It's okay, just let yourself go." And I go farther and farther away and it seems the most natural thing. But then in the morning when I'm still here I know I'm going to keep trying to let myself go! Fine. Janet. Janet, I'm afraid. I'm afraid of what is waiting for me between now and dying! Because underneath it all I want to go on. I, I, I... I want to go on and on. Well, then, let's go. Let's go. Well this is all very fine inlaid wood. Five hundred. Two thousand. It's gonna cost me a couple hundred to get it refinished. This is all handcrafted, you know. We're giving it away as it is. -Yes. -All right, 1,000. Janet, your father brought that home from an auction. I always hated it. Let them have it. You advertised a freezer? Yes, I did. It's right in here. It's yours. I wish it were a ring, Em. I love it. I'll keep it forever. Nothing lasts forever. -Hi. -Here, I'll do that. Oh, it's okay, I'm almost finished. How is she? Well, I think she's doing fine, actually. -How are you doing? -Me? I'm fine. I have a dustpan around here just-- Janet. Thank you for... taking such good care of our mother. Rob, you're here. Hi Mom. Would you mind helping Richard in the basement for a little while? I have to take Mom to the cemetery. Well, I'll take her. No. No, Janet can take me. [birds singing] Now then. Where's Henny? It's over here. Over this way. You won't come here after I'm gone. Of course I will. No you won't. And I don't want you to. Oh, yes you do. I know you think I'm old and funny. Well, you are old and funny. Dearest child... don't ever wonder if I love you. I wouldn't be standing here if it weren't for you. Well, I wouldn't be standing here if it weren't for you. We taught you how to fly and off you flew. And I thank you for that, Mom. That McLinden House. Home. I'm going to give it my best. I'm still good for a few hands of Bridge. And I never had the time to read the way I wanted to. But what you said about our time together, I want that most of all. Oh, Mom. Your brother still needs you. He just does. -Stay in touch. -I will, I will. But listen. And only because it's on my mind. You'll bury me in my blue satin winter or summer. I promise. -And no lace. -Promise. Please be sure to show them what to do with my hair. We've been over this twice already. And in the summer, I don't care if I'm in a coma, you and Richard are going to Europe. God you're bossy. There'll be plenty of money left from the sale of the house. We'll think about it, okay? Oh, that Ruthie and her damn plastic flowers! Honestly. I'm gonna take off, Ma. I'll be up to see you in a week or two. I'll be expecting you. But don't bring your laundry, dear. I'm gonna buy a washer and a dryer -with the proceeds of the house. -Oh, good for you. [laughing] Rob, if you need anything you call me, okay? You do the same. Ready? Go ahead. I'll be there in a minute. Okay. [door closes] Oh, God. Sweet heavenly days. Richard: Emily? -[door knocking] -Janet: Mom! Mom? Emily? Emily! Emily? What are you doing? It's all right Richard. Just one minute. It's time to go, Mom. I know. I know. [sobbing] I almost forgot your father's letters. [sighs] I hid them up here after the robbery. This one... This one in particular, he wrote it somewhere in France in a foxhole. They thought that they were surrounded by Germans and that the jig was up. Voiceover: "Dear Em, my heart is with you now. Our time together seems like only a moment now. A flicker in the wind. But even here with the creeping unknown just over the hill..." Lift up the knob to lock it. I always meant to have that fixed. -Did you leave the light on? -Yes. Voiceover: "But even here with the creeping unknown just over the hill I know that when two hearts have joined the bond becomes a lamp that shines forever. It shines now in this terrible place and no matter what happens I believe that it will give you strength and comfort always. There is only one thing to do in life, and that is to go on, and go on bravely. And if there is darkness remember the fire that shines for you in my heart. Em, you are my fire in the dark." ♪♪
