(engine roaring) - There he goes. Open up, damn it, open up! What the hell are you waiting for? (eerie whining sound) (dramatic music) Son of a bitch! (church bells rinsing) One of our best and we lost him. - And lost time. Valuable time. - He almost made it, almost. I'd give up my pension to find out how they discovered him. - Discovered him? Betrayed him. I want a list of all the people who knew he was an infiltrator. Be sure your name is first on that list. Not (mumbles), make sure I'm first. You're late. - Yes sir, good morning sir. Captain, I want to be put in charge of this thing. - What thing? - This thing with (mumbles) here. - No comment. Byoga thinks you'd be the worst person in the world to handle it. - Is that his final word? - For the time being. - Alright, gentlemen, Bobby's promised not to cause anymore trouble, but he does feel a little lost here. Now, if he could someone who speaks English, just for a little while until he picks up some Spanish, it would help out. - We'll see what we can do. - Alright, thank you, excuse me. - Ahh, miss? (mumbles), I'm a friend of your bother. We were in Africa together. I just got back and I haven't seen Paco in ages. I just wanted to stop by to say hello. - You mean you don't know? - What? I don't understand. - I'm sorry. Paco is dead. - I didn't know hockey was part of your job too. - Peacemaker, Bobby's an American and he caused some problems, they filed a protest with the embassy and here I am. - Would you see if you have any record of these? This isn't just routine. Please check them carefully, the Ogre is climbing a wall. - Well, I'd bet odds on that. They slipped that heroin right through your fingers, killed one of your best men-- - And made a complete jackass out of me. - Don't be too hard on yourself, you don't have a chance. You had an ace up your sleeve. The big question is how did they know the hand you were playing? You know, there's another shipment of heroin. It's out of Thailand. It's already in Europe, somewhere in the Mediterranean. What we want to know is where is it going next. - Spain. - We don't know. But there's so weird about this one. - Weird? - Yes, the Israelis are interested in it. - Is that unusual? - Very unusual. Up until now, all we could get from them was information. They always had more important things to think about, more serious matters to deal with. - So? How come heroin has suddenly become a problem? - Maybe it's not just a question of heroin. - He was so in love with life. You know, I still can't be believe he's really dead. - We joined the legion as mercenaries. They sent us out to the Congo, (mumbles) rough, really rough. Paco didn't like it, so he came back to Spain, to do what? To get killed? - I don't know, they wouldn't tell me. - They wouldn't tell you? Who wouldn't tell you? You gotta tell me, Theresa, who wouldn't tell you? - This way, please. - Say pretty please. - Move it, mister! Not your car, that one over there. (punch landing) (fast paced music) (gun firing) (tires screeching) (tires screeching) (heavy crashing) - Come on! (tires screeching) You, that way! You come with me! Check down there. - Right. (tense music) - You'll breathe out of rhythm and you're a dead soldier, come on, your gun! (mumbles) Turn around. Why didn't you tell me you were a cop? I could have saved you a lot of time, here. Let's go. - Find anything interesting in these pictures taken at the funeral? - Nothing as far as we could tell. It was just his friends and relatives. - We were pretty sure of that already, but it's worth it to double check it. - I take that to mean you're still between a rock and a hard place. - You take it right. Will you check this out for me? We suspect it's a forgery. The Ogre wants to be certain. - How soon do you have to know? - Right away. - Got a phone I can use? - Over there. (gun firing) - Today, stationary targets, ladies. Five targets, five police women. I want to see five mortal wounds in each target. Get ready. Fire at will, go. (gun firing) Straighten that leg. (gunshots firing) Good. Come on, keep your elbows straight. Squeeze it, squeeze it. (gunshots firing) Okay. Take a break, reload, and I'll be right back. - How are your girls doing? - You see for yourself they do as well as the men. Has the Ogre decided to let me handle this? - Carmen, you know how I feel about this. You were Paco's fiance, you're too involved to be able to do a good job. You'd make mistakes, you're too eager. - Then why are you here? - He'd like you to sit in while he interrogates a man we just picked up. - Does this have anything to do with Paco's case? - Could be. - Then what? - Don't push, Carmen. For the time being, just sit in while he questions him, after which we'll talk, then we'll decide. Alright? - Alright. - Good. I'll wait for you up there. - [Carmen] Maria. - Your hunch was right, the passport is forged. - Do you have a file on this man? - Oh yes, very interesting, but nothing to indicate he's mixed up in this mess. - Can I get a copy of it or is it top secret? - It's already on its way to your office. - Thanks, Sam. - Don't you mention it, amigo. If there's anything else I can do, just whistle. - Signed on as a mercenary, fought in the Congo, first against and then for Katanga. You were in Biafra, both sides there too, seems to be a specialty of yours. - Hate losing. - Zambia, Uganda, Guinea, Angola, Guinea again. Nigeria, is there anyplace in Africa you haven't fought? - The Sahara, I can't stand being thirsty. - (mumbles), expert in all the martial arts, scuba diver skiing champ, drag shot, pilot, (mumbles). So you're a parachutist too. - Happy accident. First time I bailed out, the plane was on fire. - Where you been? What have you been doing since October, 1980? - Oh, nothing special. Most of the time I spent it in a stinking African prison. I managed to escape a couple of days before they were gonna shoot me. - Now, my friend, what do you think I should do with you? - Turn me loose. But I don't think you're going to do that. - Really? What makes you think that? - Because there's something you want from me. And you haven't got it. Not yet, anyway. I'm not sure, but I think you need me. - And if that were true, what then now? - Let's talk about it. - You ever have anything to do with the drug trade? - Never. - Good, you might just be able to help me. - How? - Infiltrate a gang of heroin smugglers, find out their plans, pass on the information to me. - Well, I don't like it. The market controls the drug trade and the market plays for keeps. - (mumbles) - What's in it for me? - To begin with, I'll drop all the charges against you. - Oh, come on, chief. You haven't got any charges against me. I'm not a wanted man. - What about Africa? - How about money? How much would it be worth? - We don't usually pay for this kind of a job. - That's a big mistake. - The mistake is yours, my friend, because there's somebody around a hell of a lot worse than the mafia. - Who? - Me. I'll keep you in jail until you rot. I'll eliminate all the records of your entering Spain. You won't even exist. I'm in no hurry, you can have all the time you want to think about it. Take him away. Well, what do you think? - I think he's horrible, sir. But he has everything we need. - Then I wasn't wrong about him. - [Carmen] Sell us out the first chance he gets. - It'll be up to you to see to it that he doesn't. - Up to me, sir? - You are the only one he'll be directly in contact with. You and I and captain Casado will be the only ones who know about him, (mumbles) And your job is to make certain that he doesn't betray us. - Does that mean I'm in charge of the case? - More or less. - Thank you, sir. - [Herman] Herman here, sir. - From now on, the prison is to be given nothing to eat or drink. - When do we eat in this place? - Meals are served three times a day, same as anyone else. Unfortunately, we don't usually keep prisoners in this jail, so when we do, we sometimes forget (mumbles). It's a sad business. - This drug thing, is the offer still? - Could be. - Boss, for one reason or another, you've got this thing. You've got yourself a volunteer. When do we eat? - Whenever you need to get in touch with me, call this number. Say you need a spare part, it's (mumbles). Don't mention any names, a spare part's enough. - Are you sure? - No one asks for a spare part without specifying what part they want. - Very clever. - You'd better learn the number by heart. - All this sounds great, but how do you plan to get me to the (mumbles)? - By invitation. - Oh really? And what makes you so sure they'll invite me to join the club? - They need people like you. If you play your part well, they will. - Well, I'm up for grabs, why not? What's the plan? - Parachute school. If you show them what you can do, someone might very well make you a dishonest proposition. (engine roaring) - You the instructor here? - No, I am your skydiver. - I would like to make a jump, who do I talk to? - With Bermejo. - Who's Bermejo? - Come on, I introduce you. Bermejo, this gentleman want to make a jump. - Where have you jumped? - El Sonora, California. - Do you have paperS? - No. - I'm sorry, you can't jump without papers and besides, the plane's full. - I'm sorry. - Everybody, attention, let's go. - I'm late for a flight. (speaking foreign language) - Alright, get in. - Thank you. - Clear runway 17, takeoff when ready. (engine starting up) - [David] I've got over 600 hours with this plane. I learned to fly in it. - [Tower] Okay, it's all yours. - [David] Thank you! Yoohoo! (energetic music) (engine roaring) - Hey, what do you think you're doing? Get that plane out of the restricted area! Clear the area, clear the area! - [David] Roger, tower. Off we go into the wild blue yonder. (engine roaring) (peaceful music) Hey, you guys, wait up, what's your hurry? Learn to follow a footprint! (peaceful music) - Are you crazy? You fly like a lunatic! You jump without papers, what are you trying to do? Get me fired? - I'm sorry about that, you gave me no other choice. - Find yourself another school, we can't teach you anything. - You're wrong there, I think you're great. Isn't he miss, uh, miss? - Laura. She's a very good jumper, she's fantastic. - I can tell that just by looking at her. - That's the owner. That's the (mumbles). Here's the man with the pointed beard again. Hey Jim, are you sure he doesn't work there? - Positive, there are only two employees and you've got them both over there in that other pile. The guy with the beard comes around a lot, but he doesn't work there. He's inside right now. - Well, aren't they closed? - Doesn't matter, he comes and goes at all hours, day or night. - (mumbles), find out where he goes, who he talks to, everybody. - You've got it. - Is there a rear door to the shop? - Check. - I know, you want a key. (engines roaring) (peaceful music) - [Laura] What are you doing, are you crazy? Let go of me, let go of me! - [David] Relax, take it easy, baby! - [Laura] Get away from me, leave me alone! - [David] Okay, if you insist, but you're gonna miss out on the mile high club! - Go to hell! (peaceful music) (engine roaring) (laughing) Are you out of your mind or what? If you want to kill yourself, go ahead and kill yourself if you want, but leave me alone! I don't want your help! - Baby-- - You think you are very funny, don't you? Well, you are not! I don't ever want to see you again! - Okay. - Ever! - Okay! (piano music playing) - It was such a lovely day, thank you. - Time forgotten for a while. - Yes, for a little while. I'd hate to see it end. - Doesn't have to, not yet anyway. - You are such a strange man, baby. I'm not sure what I think. I'm afraid of you. - Afraid of me? Why? - Because of the way you make me feel. - Is that bad? - Yes. No. - A little more Brimmer's wine? - Time for me to go. - Tomorrow? - Perhaps. (smooth piano playing) (knocking on door) (tense music) (knocking) - Who is it? - It's me! Do you like this or do I need a parachute? - I don't have my altimeter. But I think I can risk it. (soft music) Laura? Laura? Laura? - Desk clerk, may I help you? - Uh, look, I don't know her room number, but she's staying at this hotel. Her name is Laura, I don't know her last name. - I think I know the (mumbles) you mean sir, but I can't put you through. - Why not? - She checked out early this morning. - She checked out? Do you know where she went? - I believe she was going to Levan, Switzerland, sir. She had a friend who was flying there and took advantage of the chance to ride along. - I see. - [Clerk] Will there be anything else, sir? - No, no, no, it's okay, thank you. Funny thing I was just about to tell you that I made contact. It was a classic bait. Sounded me out before the big cheese came along with a proposition. - You've seen too many movies. - She cleaned me out. Wallet, watch, money, everything. - Don't you carry your money with you? - Always do. - Than I don't understand how she could have taken it. - When I make love, I take my clothes off. - Don't be vulgar. - Sorry, I forgot you're not for real, lady. What do I do now? - Go back to school. - Back to school, do you think it's worthwhile? - Keep putting on your exhibitions, keep your eyes open wide. And try not to let them strip you clean again. - And meanwhile, what do I live on? - Here. Don't get in the habit of expecting it. And don't call me unless it's absolutely necessary. I have my own job to do, do you understand? - Mhm. - You can go now. What about the man from the shop? - Didn't get much, I followed him a couple of times. Always ended up in the port at the out harbor. Then he disappears. - He saw you. - It's hard to tail someone down there. If you get too close, they see you. If you keep your distance, you loose them. - I don't want excuses, I want results. - I'm sorry. - Did you get the key? - Yes, but I didn't get a chance to find out if it works. - I'll do it. - Do you want me to go with you? - No. You go back to headquarters and tell Captain Casada to put you on another job. Thank you, Ari, that'll be all. (tense music) (footsteps scrabbling, metal clanging) (guns firing) - Are you okay? - Wait! - What are you doing? He's gonna get away! - Have you got the car? - Of course. - Let's go. - Go away, I don't-- - (mumbles), then you'll (mumbles). (motorcycle engine whining) (gunshot firing) Car! What were you doing in that shop? I thought I told you you were off the case. - [Ari] You did, but the captain didn't buy it. - Why did you shoot at him? - What do you mean why did I shoot at him? He was about to kill you. - It wasn't that bad, I had the situation under control. If you'd killed him, you would have spoiled everything. - I'm beginning to regret taking a shot at him, but for a different reason. - He isn't here yet, but he won't be long. - How do you know? - Be quiet, keep yourself hidden under there! - Why? - Then follow him, I don't care if he sees you, understand? - I'll be damned if I do! - Just do as I say, go on! - Okay, okay! (mysterious music) (engine roaring) (camera shutter snapping) (camera shutter snapping) (camera shutter snapping twice) - What are these? - Personal belongings of our man from (mumbles). - How did you get them? - Oh, I used a very bright young lady from our auxiliary group. I employ her regularly for special assignments. (engines roaring) - Is it your own invention? - Homemade. - My compliments. - Thank you. - Do you really how important that thing of yours could be? - As a sport? - As a source of income, or doesn't money interest you? - Does a fish like water? - The job entails taking a short flight, carrying a small payload and keeping your mouth shut. - And who will I be working for? - What difference does that make? Let's just say you'll be working for some friends. Some very generous friends. - I already like your generous friends. - There's a certain element of risk involved. - That means somebody's gonna be after me. - Only if they find out what you're up to. - Don't worry, they won't. - You scared? - I don't even know what the word means. - I think you and I are gonna get along just fine. - I think so too. - I'm sorry, but the answer is no. The yacht VEGA is registered in Casablanca, to Ambassador Abdul Hassan Achmed El Carib. I can't issue a search order. We would be risking a diplomatic incident. (mumbles), you wouldn't find anything anyway. They're too clever for that. Instead of raising an alarm, we are going to leave them alone. Business as usual. But keep a sharp eye on them. I hope they will lead us exactly where we want to go. That's all. - Senor Gushard, (speaking foreign language). (foreign language) Congratulations. - Thank you very much. (speaking foreign language) - I'd like your opinion. What do you think of the picture? - Very interesting, but extremely difficult to obtain. - So I've been told. Of course the main thing is to know where to find it. It's here today, but it may be at some other show tomorrow. I'd like to be able to keep track of it. - No problem. You know, you're not the only person interested in it. - Really? So I've got some competition. - Stiff competition. This picture is filled with priceless artistic secrets. (both speaking foreign language) Perhaps you'd like to get together later on? We can talk about it some more. - My pleasure. (crowd murmuring in surprise) - [Announcer] Please bear with us, ladies and gentleman. There's been a blackout. The lights will be back on in a moment. Please, ladies and gentlemen, bear with us. Thank you. (crowd murmuring) (woman screaming) - Where does that door lead? - The storeroom. - Does it have an exit to the street? - Yes sir. - Call the police! - Yes, sir! (crowd murmuring) (dramatic music) - Give yourself up! Stop or I'll shoot! (dramatic music) (gunshots firing) (gunshot firing) (gunshots firing) (dull thuds) - When did they make contact with you? - A few days ago. - And you're telling me now? - I just wanted to be sure. One disaster's enough. - Are you sure this time? Male or female. - Male. - What's he like? - Like me, more or less, only older and uglier. - Did you get a picture of him? - Oh, come on, nobody said I'm supposed to go around taking pictures of people. - You might have thought of it yourself if you were really interested in your job. - Now look, lady. If you want a picture of him so bad, why don't you go out there yourself and ask him for a photo? Probably he might even autograph it for you. - Oh, come on, stop it. - "Oh, come on, stop it." - Can I have one? What did they want? - They want me to deliver a package, 20 kilos pure. - Where? - Around the Strait of Gibraltar. - Why there? Because I'm not about to fly more than 30 kilometers over water or at an altitude of more than 3000 meters. And I plan to keep as possible to the strait. Just far enough away not to alarm the British. He'll think it's a sporting event trying to set some kind of a record, I dunno. - When? - Soon, very soon, depends on me. - Why is that? - Well, one, the conditions have to be just right. I can move the flight up or delay the mission if necessary, but not too much. - Where's the takeoff point? - Morocco. - Fine. - You'll have a contact in Casablanca. - You? - No. But I'll let you know as soon as it's set up. Good luck. What are you doing? Stop it! (sharp groan of protest) - Winter on the outside, but you're not fooling anybody, baby. You're a boiling hot summer inside. - Get out of here. - Aye aye, sir. Laura, Laura! (dramatic music) Laura, wait, I just want to talk to you! - Go away, please go away! - Laura, please, I just want to talk to you! Come on, wait for me! (loud smacking) (men grunting) (grunting, thuds of blows landing) - Poor thing, he's so good looking. - Now we have the missing piece of the puzzle. - What is it, sir? - The complete description of what your friend is going to do. The date, the hour, even the place where he'll cross the Strait. - Is it from my man in Casablanca? - No. - The Americans? - No. Not the Israelis. So it's obvious. They sent it themselves, the people who hired him. They want to lead us on a wild goose chase. He's just a decoy. - Then David is probably carrying 20 kilos of bicarbonate, just like the last time. - Right. And what we're after is on board that yacht. - What do we do? - Swallow the hook. Go after our high flying friend. We'll make our preparations in broad daylight. We won't be the least bit secretive about it, (mumbles) believe that they fooled us. That we've gone for the bait. - How do we warn David? - We don't, we can't afford to risk it. - But he'll be killed if we don't! - Your friend is expendable, Carmen. All I can do is give the order that I want him taken alive, if possible. All you can do is wish him luck. - Start out by flying inland for a couple of minutes, then turn and head out to sea. But be careful that you follow the route we've laid out for you. - Check. The main thing is that somebody's waiting for me on the other side. - Worry about it, he'll be waiting for you. - What was that you were saying, captain? - Oh, nothing, sir. - Excellent, they're heading back into Spanish territory waters. That means your friend is in the air. Time to go, let's move it. (tense music) (sonar beeping) - We'll make contact in just about 30 minutes. - Would that be in Spanish territory waters? - Yes sir. - Bridge, CIC, radar contact, heading 270. Distance 4.2 miles, speed, eleven knots. Possible yacht, CIC, Alba. - [Bridge] Roger, CIC, we read you. (tense music, waves crashing) - Are you gonna risk boarding her, sir? - I am. - It's been confirmed the ambassador is aboard the yacht. There'll be a diplomatic problem. - On the contrary, the ambassador will thank us for it. (engines whining) - The beach over there, land! Take her down now! This is your last chance, put it down or I'll shoot you down. (speaking foreign language) (eerie whooping) (tense music) - Abandon ship, abandon ship while you can. I repeat, there is danger of an explosion. Our route men will deactivate the bow. - On the beach, buddy. (energetic music) - Please use our boat, your Excellence. It'll take you to the cutter and our men will begin their work at once. - Why (mumbles) the dog? - [Captain] He's trained to find explosives. - I remain here. - I'm sorry, sir, but you must abandon ship. Our government would be held responsible if anything happened to you. I'm sorry, sir, it's a great responsbility. This won't take long and then your Excellence can continue his trip in peace. - If we don't find the heroin after all the trouble the Ogre went through putting on this show, I'm not going back. - Come on, Sadie, it's got to be here, find it. What do you think you're on, a pleasure cruise? (waves crashing) (engine roaring) - We've got our information from a very reliable source, your Excellency, but we've (mumbles) there's a very powerful bomb on board your yacht. - I can't believe it, who'd want me dead? - Enemies of your people, terrorists, who wish to strike a very brutal blow against your country's heart. - No doubt about it, the stuff's in there. - They found the bomb, your Excellency. Plastic charge, powerful enough to blow the yacht to bits. - May I see, please? - Further still, your Excellency. You will be able to see my men explode it, at a safe distance. Come on, this way. (soft music) (bomb exploding) (engine humming) - Your Excellency, the boat is standing by to take you back to your yacht. You're now free to go. - Very good, thank you. - What happens when the ambassador discovers his cargo is missing? - Drop it. He cannot complain without giving himself away. If he did, we'd have to arrest him. After all, the poor fellow is in Spanish territorial waters. (dramatic music) - Hey, over here, hurry up! I've been looking for you for over two hours, the woods are crawling with cops. - You're telling me, who are you? - Your contact, I'm supposed to get out (mumbles) here, hurry up! - What's the matter? - Nothing, it's just that this one's a little heavier than the others. Wait, wait, wait. - Well, well. So you made it across the straits? You trust you have less problem than I did. - Get in the car. - Do I get to know where I'm going? - No. Sorry, but I'm just following orders. - Whose? - That's none of your business. - Sergio, every time I see you, you remind me more and more of your brother. - Get in. - And if I don't? - Oh, okay, okay, I'll get in, Mr. Robot! Just take it easy. - Get moving. - Uranium oxide. Properly handled, you can extract plutonium from it. Plutonium is an essential ingredient in producing nuclear bombs. - Excuse me, sir, how much plutonium can be obtained from the contents of that box? - None. Practically none, anyway. Takes at least two tons to get enough to make a single bomb. - I don't get it. What was that box doing on the ambassador's yacht? - That's a good question. Answer it. - A sample? - Exactly. A sample for someone who wants to make a bomb. Potential customer. - Who? The ambassador? - That doesn't seem likely. His country does not have the reactor needed to extract the plutonium. - Then who? - Let's back up a little. Where was the yacht coming from? - Monty Carlo. - France. The country with huge reserves of uranium oxide. - Which they can't sell, they signed a treaty. - (mumbles). Look at it this way. Suppose it was stolen? - I see. - So now we know the secret that cost your friend Fisher his life. - Fisher was killed by Libya. - And Libya does have a reactor for obtaining plutonium. - That explains why the Israeli secret service was mostly around the Mediterranean. - That's right, Fisher mentioned it. The Israelis don't get that excited over a few kilos of heroin. - Wait, wait, wait, that's enough. It's too soon to start congratulating ourselves. We know what we're looking for, where it came from, where it's going, and that's all now. Unless they're trying to move the cargo through Spanish territory, there's nothing we can do. (mumbles) - Until somebody starts talking. - (mumbles). - You can go now. Sorry about that. - Go in. (tense music) (David whistling) - Hiya, pal. - (mumbles), what are you doing here? - How about all this? - Well, I'll be damned. You sure came a long way since you left the legion. - You bet. Come on, we got a lot to talk about. Let's have a drink. (men grunting) - Something wrong? (mumbles), very few left like him. I hope nothing has happened to him. - Look at his arm. The tattoo. - An eagle? With extended wings? - You remember it? - What do you mean? - Can't you remember seeing it the night you were with him? - I don't remember, who was looking for a tattoo at a time like that? I'm sorry! (men grunting) - That your wife? - Are you kidding? Susie's perfect, pneumatic, nympho, and dumb. Never trust 'em and stay alive. You want her? You got her. I'll get you one of your own. Hey, it's your shot. You know, they wanted to give you a dummy parcel crossing the straits. They didn't trust you. I bet on my old buddy, I was right. - Thanks. - Too bad you weren't carrying the main action. They lost a shipment. - Main action? You mean I was the bait? - Well, you got it old buddy. - You set me up. - Oh, I don't know what to tell you, old buddy. - Suppose they killed me? - Don't tell me you're worried about that? - Yeah, I worry about it. - You're getting old, Davie, fading in the stretch. Too bad. I was counting on you for the big one. - [David] As the bait? - No, as my main man, pal. - Why don't you tell me about it? - Well. There are four tons of heroin in a refinery in Palermo. - Did you say four tons? - That's right. It's not unusual, they find about 20 a year. We got to get as much out as fast as we can. How much can you handle? - Me? - Well, the problem is, these gotta be flown across the Pyrenees, dropped at a thousand meters at night. Now, how much cargo can be dropped by a parachute set to open the last second. - How long do I have to come up with an answer? - Take your time, tomorrow morning. Right, it's got to work. Otherwise it's everything or nothing. - And just what does nothing mean? - The bliss of eternal sleep, old buddy. Wanna lose another game of croquet? (gate creaking) (organ music playing) Hi, pal, sit down. I'm really sorry about what happened, gentlemen. Of course, if you'd used my organization, you wouldn't have lost it. That cargo would have reached its destination. - That's why we are here. We are concerned about what we have lost, but we are even more concerned about what we could lose. - I'm listening. - [Ambassador] We have another cargo. - What kind? - First, we have to know if you can do the job. - Fair enough. - It has to be shipped from a base in France to (mumbles). - How much weight? - [Ambassador] Four tons. - Any problems landing in Libya? - On the contrary, you will be protected from the moment you enter Libyan air space. - Sure, I can do it. But I gotta know what the cargo is. Can't be more dangerous than heroin. - Maybe, uranium oxide. - Yeah? Sounds like somebody's gonna build a bomb. (dramatic music) - What took you so long? - Just warming up, baby. You always sit outside in this kind of weather? - I was born in Minnesota, I miss the snow. You were a busy boy last night. A very busy boy. - It's nothing like a little challenge. - Yeah, I noticed. Here, explain that. - Right. I won't go into any detail about the material, but the box can be cardboard with a sponge rubber lining. The main thing is how much can it hold? Considering the weight, volume, acceleration, and rate of fall, I could have a 500 kilo cargo in it jumping at 2000 meters and opening the shoots at 600 meters. - Not bad. - Two jumpers go at the same time, each one holds a handle. - Who's the guy? - Somebody I can trust. - I want to meet him. - Okay, but he still doesn't know anything. You choose the time and the place of the departure and I'll see that the cargo gets to its destination. If it works, we can empty the refinery in a couple days. What more could you ask, old buddy? - That it doesn't fail, old buddy. - It won't. - Where's your good luck charm, the star of David? I've never seen you without it. - I lost it, I haven't had a chance to buy another one. - I'll get you one. No good Jew should be without his star. - Have you ever jumped in a parachute? - Yes. - Would you dare jump at night, hanging to a 500 kilo box and opening your chute at 600 meters? - Would you? - Yes, I would. - Then I would too. Why me? - We made a bargain, remember? The only ones who would know who I am, it would be you, the captain, and the Ogre. I need help. Somebody's got to make that jump with me. I doubt that they will find this idea very appealing. That leaves you. - I need the captain's permission. - I figure you would. - Here are the details of the operation, give them to him. He'll say yes. Bob, we'll be there in two hours. This nation France and we're in the Pyrenees. Come on, let's go. (crowd cheering, applauding) - You are not going. the Ogre would have my head if I let you go. - You're wrong there, captain. I don't know who this ogre is, haven't the faintest idea, but I say she goes. - Thank you, sir. - But don't waste any time now. Get on your way before this ogre shows up and countermands my orders. - Right, captain. (engine roaring) (dramatic music) - You're to come with me. - I'll go get my coat. - That won't be necessary, just you. - See you later, honey. - How's it going, Mr. Brodwick? - Let's go. - Don't push me around, Sergio. - Move it. - Come over here, come to sit, come with (mumbles), have a good time. - Excuse me, gentlemen, but I promised my fiancee a drink. The usual, darling? - Thank you, darling. - Get in. - Sergio, you're beginning to get on my nerves. - Wise guy, go on. (mellow music) - Where's your boyfriend? - How do you know I have one? - You're a knockout, baby. You'll never be alone. - Thanks. He'll be back in a little while. - Is he working? - Oh no, we're here to enjoy ourselves. - I'll bet he does. What's his name, maybe I know him? - David Smith. - What's he do for a living? - I don't know, something really important? I don't think women should meddle in men's affairs. There are so many more pleasant ways to spend your time, don't you think? - I'll drink to that. - You two alone? - Oh yes. - Well, if something happens to him, hook me up. Everybody knows me around here. - Thank you, could be interesting. - My name is McFadden. - Nice to meet you, Mr. McFadden. - You too, baby, bye. - Bye. (tense music) One key, please. (tense music) - Everything okay? - Perfect. Holds up just fine. - Good, now all we got to do is fill them with cargo and take off. - Tonight? - I'm gonna be busy. Relax, enjoy that broad you brought along. - What? I treat her like my sister. (laughing) (tense music) Two trucks for 600 kilos? - Yeah, the airport's up in the mountains. Lot of snow, in case one gets stuck. - That's why I like working with you. Because you think of everything. - You bet, pal. (engine starting up) - Is this the front desk? - [Clerk] Yes, ma'am, can I help you? - Has the gentlemen in 43 returned? - [Clerk] Not yet, ma'am. - When he does, ask him to call me. Please don't forget. - Yeah, don't worry, I won't forget, ma'am. - You know who that is beside him, don't you? It's the spy, the one we got rid of on the last drop. I never did like that guy. Tell him something happened, I want to see him. Tell him to bring his girl. Take the men. If he tries to get away, kill him. - Yes, sir. - The picture, it's gone. - What picture? - The one of you and Paco. - But why on Earth did you even have it? - Would take too long to explain. - Did you have to carry it around with you? - No, of course I didn't, I forgot it. What do you want me to do about it? - Well, with that kind of proof, I go right down the toilet, baby. - We'll think of something. (dramatic music) - [Sergio] Go in the back, you stay here. - Too late, they're coming for us now, we got to get out of here, let's go through the back. Hurry up. (tense music) (smacks of punches landing) - Where we going? - Anyplace but here. (engine roaring) (fast paced music) - Control, calling the F Word, do you read me? (engine roaring) (fast paced music) Control the plane, pursue and destroy. I want them dead, do you read me? - Roger, control, I read you, we're coming in now. (fast paced music) (gun firing) (fast paced music) - Climb on my back, hurry up, come on. (fast paced music) (engine roaring) - Can't go any lower, there's too much turbulence. - Damn it, I don't want excuses, I want them. (fast paced music) Let's get out of here. (fast paced music) - Hey, hey, hey, what are you doing? Come back here, hey! (up tempo music) - You stupid idiot! How could you let them get away? Now get the men, take the dogs. I want their bodies laid out here. If you've screwed me up, you're gonna be laying next to 'em. Get the pilot in here. - Yes, sir. (dramatic music) - You know what's that place? My friend's hideout. - You're crazy. - Maybe so, but that's the last place he'll look for us. - And now what? - You go that way and wait for my signal, okay? Go, go. (dramatic music) - Very funny, haven't you got anything better to do? - What the hell are you talking about? - This. - We've got a problem, we got to leave right away. - Yes sir. - And don't come back. Wait 'til you hear from me. - What about tomorrow's flight? - It's canceled. Everything goes tonight. - [Man with Mustache] That would mean 500 extra kilos. That and the weight of two people, we'd never get off the ground. - People aren't going. - Then maybe we can manage. - You make it, I'll double that. - We'll make it, sir. - Do you know what's in them? - You're the one (mumbles) what's in them. - Uranium oxide. - How do you know? - (mumbles) the ambassador's boat. - But you don't know where it's going. - Tripoli. - Do you know we've got to stop it? - I know, do you have a plan? - No, do you? I think we should stick to the boxes. Maybe we have a chance to get them for us. - What's happening? - We're going to Paris, baby. - Paris? Not Majorca? - Honey, you got three minutes. I'm going with you or without you. Move it. - What the hell are you doing here? Come out to the tracks, hurry up! - Okay. - Let's go. - Let's go. (engine starting) - Sounds like things are starting to happen. (tense music) - Truck around and get ready to load. - Hold it, what are you doing? (mumbles) - No way, stay where you are until the fuel tanks-- - Sorry, pal, but I can't, waste of time. - I'm responsible for this cargo getting where it's going-- - Alright, alright, you've got 10 minutes. - 10 minutes. With a little bit of luck, that'll be enough, baby. - [Worker] Turn it around and back it up. Send it around, back up. (tense music) - That's it. - [Worker] Okay, on the double, time to load. Come on. (tense music) - (mumbles) over there. - Yeah, (mumbles). (tense music) - Bring it here! - It's all yours, good luck. - Thanks. (tense music) I'll secure the hatch. - Don't move or I'll put a hole in your gut. (engine starting) - Load it up. - Move it! - [Worker] Hurry up. - Hey, who the hell are you? What are you doing here? - Me? - Yes, you! - Oh, let me introduce myself. (grunting) (engine roaring) - Right, you, move! - What's the hell's going on? - Stay put, baby, or I'll burn a hole right through you. And keep in mind I don't need you, I can fly this thing myself. - We need more airspeed. - You're done fine, get going. (engine roaring) Hold this altitude. But change your course to 180 degrees. You, get into a parachute. Carmen, give him a hand. Carmen, come over here. See what he's doing? - Yes? - Do it. You, out. Come on, get moving. - We've never jumped before, you can't throw us out. - Oh, yes I can. Jump out or I'll blow you out. One... Two... Get going, come on! Sweetheart, it would be a real shame if you crashed now. - Young man, you've done the world a valuable service. We've got the drugs and the uranium, France gets the glory for capturing McFadden, and the responsbility of taking better care of her atomic wastes. And America will get the points for closing the Palomar refinery. It's what you might call a full house. - [Announcer] Flight 425, from Barcelona-- - It's time for you to (mumbles). - [Announcer] Geneva and Tel Aviv now loading at gate number three. - Uh, chief? From one service man to another, there's something I want to ask you which is driving my bosses crazy. - What is it? - Who in the hell is that agent of yours who turns up everywhere? The one they call the Ogre? - The Ogre? - Yeah. - I'd like to meet him myself, as a matter of fact. Could you arrange that, Captain Casado? - Did I say something wrong?
