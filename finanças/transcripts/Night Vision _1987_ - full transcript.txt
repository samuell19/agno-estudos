(peaceful music) (upbeat rock music) - Word out. (engine revving) (ominous music) (ghostly chanting) (static buzzing) (cat screeches) (blood squelching) (static buzzing) (ghostly chanting) (drill rattling) - Hello mom, you wouldn't believe it. I bet there isn't a city this size in all of Kansas. I promise alright. No, look, I got to go. Yeah. I love you too. (upbeat pop music) (people chattering) - Are you the landlord? - Registration is right this way sir. - Thank you. Excuse me. I'd like to get a room please. - Yeah, you and 300 buffalo's Mary, huh? (laughing) Hey why don't we all stay in your room huh? (laughing) As a matter of fact get us room, we'll teach you the sacred chant huh boys? - Yeah! (laughing) - The buffalo chant. - [Men Together] Buffalo, buffalo, buffalo, buffalo. Brr. (laughing) - You better call the zoo and see if anybody's missing from the monkey house. - Hey, can we get some service here? Come on, we've got an entire city of beautiful women just waiting for us. - Yeah. - That's right yeah. - Besides all that, liquor stores close in five hours. - That's on a bill. Hey put it there. (electrical buzzing) (groans) (laughing) Must be my electric personality, hey boys? (laughing) - Sir, have you tried the Crystal Regency before? - No, but it seems like an awfully nice place. It's got those neat arches and it's so tall. - So you blow it up. And hide it under the seat cushion, and when somebody goes to sit down, fiesta time. (laughing) - Alright, how many people in your room? - I don't know, I haven't seen it yet. Don't you know? (laughs) (whoopee cushion mimics flatulence) (laughing) - That was a good one. - I assure you gentleman, flatulence will get you nowhere. (laughing) - How long do you plan on staying sir? - I don't know, my mom didn't even want me to come in the first place, but you know how mom's are. About a week before I left she was-- - Sir, do you want a room or not? - Well, how much is it? - $225 plus tax. - That's a little more than I planned on, but it does seem to be a pretty fancy place. Do you need the first month up front? - Look, the entire atrium just lost hot water. We're entirely overbooked at the weekend and I have a big audition and you're making me lose focus. So I need to see some plastic please. Your number? - Oh. Eight seven six, nine eight seven three, zero zero nine, eight seven, zero zero zero nine eight. - Okay, that's enough. I think we have enough numbers. I'll tell you what. For our special guests we have Bruce our hospitality specialist show you to your room. (bell dings) Bruce. Yes Bruce please show this gentleman to the special suite we reserve for out of town guests. You know, way out of town. - Right this please. - Be gentle bro. - Goodbye Percy. Bye. (groaning) - Hey, hey, hey come on. - [Commentator] So with a vertical up, pitcher of this young rookie seams from the mound. Two singles and a wall camped out of the bases and now the counter slugger Hernandes stands at two and two. It's another crunch situation for Boston and you can only imagine how high the heat is on for John Steve Taggart as he checks the runner at first only for second to give Kansas the lead. - Excuse me. - The answer's yes. Yes I am losing my ass on this god damn game. (upbeat rock music) Hey turn down that god damn noise! I said turn it down, or I'll adjust the volume for you. - [Woman] Alright! - So was it something you wanted or you just here to soak up the atmosphere? - I really need a place to stay. Is there something available? - Desperate huh? Well that's the only kind we've got in here. - Good evening Miss Sapperstein, I seem to have misplaced my room key. - Oh for Christ's sake Charlotte, that's the second time this month. What'd you do leave it in the pants of some sailor? - By now that key could be somewhere in the Pacific. In the heat of passion so many things can become misplaced, you do understand what I mean Miss Sapperstein. - I wouldn't have any idea, Miss Charlotte. - It's just that love can be so powerful, we sometimes forget ourselves. You're not from around here are you sweetie? - No ma'am. I just got in from Kansas this afternoon. - Well honey, you're not in Kansas anymore. - (clears throat) About the room? - Come on, that was a strike you moron. Rooms are 60 bucks a week. You get clean sheets every Tuesday. I don't want anything on the old ones that can't either be explained or bleached out. Bathrooms down the hall. Always be sure to turn on the light before you go in, it gives the roaches time to hide. - Could I see it? - Believe me kid, it ain't no pretty picture. You seen a bathroom before haven't you? - No, I meant the room. - Same thing only with a bed in it. The Royal Suite kid. Knock yourself out. Excuse me while I go kill somebody. Oh, speaking of which, there's a lead pipe underneath each bed. Extra protection. Included in the price. (light buzzing) (melancholy music) (tap dripping) (ominous music) (thudding) - [Woman] I've had it, I've had it. This is over, I need to finish it, bye. - [Man] Don't you leave me bitch. Don't make me hurt you. Come here, I'm gonna kick your ass. (slap cracks) You bitch. Come on get up. I'm gonna hurt you bad. (suitcase rattling) Where you going? Hey, now now, not again. - Underwear when did? Thanks mom. (ominous music) Hi mom. Yeah, I'm fine. Yeah. Yeah this place is great. Yeah I am. I'm looking for work this morning. Mom, mom, I already tried to tell you. Writers have to experience life. I can't continue to write about hogs and heffers. Look listen, I got to go. Yeah, every night before I go to bed. Yeah I do too. Okay. - Sounds like a nice lady your mother. Quiet down. You should tell her you love her. I'll be slipping one of these under your door every Monday. I expect cash, no check, on my desk by 5:00 p.m.. You come back with any excuses we got major trouble, understand? So what you writing about kid? - Well I don't know yet, but I'm sure I'll find it in this city. (ominous music) I know, I've never actually had a job. I know but. But I am a good writer, Hello my name is-- (horn honking) - [Receptionist Dream Publishing. - Hi, I'm Andy Archer and I would like to speak to someone in your personnel department. - [Receptionist] Can you hold? - Yeah. About the proof readers job. No, no I'm not a college graduate but I-- - [Man] Hey, it's mine. Come on! (siren blaring distantly) - Hey, in case you haven't noticed that sections for the big kids understand? Hey, I hate to disappoint you and your hormones but these are for display only. Now why don't you go steal some hubcaps like the rest of the neighborhood kids. And don't come back. Hey I keep mace under the counter, the good kind. Makes you go blind for life. Substitute Teachers In Heat maybe the kid wants to go blind. What are you a cop? - No, I'm just catching some natural dialogue. - Yeah, well here's so natural dialogue Jack, either pay for the tape or get your ass out of here. - Yeah, yeah, no, you didn't think I-- - I don't know what to think anymore. I've had it with this place, I've had it with this neighborhood, I've had it with this city. Oh I'm sure you'll find some good natural dialogue in there. - That sign in the window, is there still a job here? - What do I tell you? With the glamor and excitement this gig provides we've had to turn lots of people away. You can fill that out and see what happens. What are you doing right now? - Oh, I was just gonna go get a corn dog and maybe head on down to the-- - Not this very minute. What are you doing for work right now? - Oh I have work in progress, it's a novel. And I just submitted a bunch of my short stories to some magazines. - Really though, that's too bad. We had a position for a writer. Nice job too. But we just filled it. Your own office, secretary and all the corn dogs you could eat. - Oh, well I have to make some money. I just moved here and have to cover expenses, you know rent, food. - Pencils, paper, research material. Fill out the app and come back when the owner's here. Anything else? - Oh jeez, I don't know what I was thinking. I don't even have a tape player for this. - Give me a break. You can rent this one for two nights for five bucks. I want $3 for insurance, sign this. And I'll tell you what, I'll let you keep this over the weekend if you promise to write me into that novel of yours. - Sure thanks, that's great. You're really one of the nicest people I've met since I left home. - Really, where's home? - Uh Kansas. (ominous music) - Vinnie Scotto? - Who wants to know? Can we settle this in a civilized fashion? (groaning) - Some people say you might have what we're looking for? - [Vinnie] Well, people are wrong. - Something important of ours has been stolen, we must have it back. - I tell you, I don't know anything about it. Hey, careful of the watch. - I don't think you realize what you're dealing with here. - Hey, what's going on here? - This does not concern you. (groaning) - Come on, let's get out of here. (ominous music) (footsteps clicking) (panting) Would you get a load of those guys? I was simply walking down the street, minding my own business. They must have been after my gold watch. It was my fathers. Family hair piece. - Heirloom? - Yeah like I said. Hmm, I gotta get this on a postcard. I'm a major attraction in this town. Vincent C. Scotto, pleased to meet you. - Andy Archer. Boy, you were really taking a whooping back there. - [Vinnie] What are you a cop? Do you always go around rescuing people? - I guess not. - You're not from around here are you? - No, I just got in from Kansas. - Kansas. (laughs) Land of corn fed women and whippings. Oh Andy, if you're here to stay you better pick up on the way things go down. A man has to know the angles if he's gonna make it big. Oh, this really is my lucky night. I'm suddenly thirsty, what do you flip for first round? Tails. I'm partial to a good imported beer myself, but you make the final decision my friend. - Vinnie I can't. I'm trying to economize, I just got here. - Oh sure, sure. Better keep an eye on the savings. - Yeah. - Yeah, yeah. I like to watch money too Andy. I like to watch it become mine. (laughs) You know, I have a good feeling about you and me. And I think we could. I happen to be on a first name basis with the owner. I'll be right back. Psst, come on. Refreshments are getting warm, let's go. Come on. (people shouting) - Hey come back here you son of a bitch! Get that guy! - Boy you sure got a lot of locks. - So, what brought you to this magnificent metropolis? - I'm a writer. I came up here to experience real life. - Don't they have real life where you come from? - Oh no, the most exciting thing back home is when the neighbor lady broke, broke her leg. The whole town turned out to sign her cast. - How do you decide what to write about? - Oh, every writer has his own way. Some rely on dreams, some on experiences. I just keep my mind open as much as I can. Things just sort of pop into it all on their own. Mom says I'm too susceptible to things. Can I use your restroom? - There's to be susceptible too around here pal. It's that way. - Thanks. (ominous music) - You uh, you like radios huh? - One of my electronic enterprises. By low, sell high. It's the American way. Go ahead, take a look. Oh, you like that one. Just got it in. (electrical buzzing) (gasps) - This thing plugged in? I just got a shock. - Must be static electricity my boy. Be careful around the sophisticated equipment. Got some suppliers down on Third Street. Normally they don't have anything for me, but this time, voila. Even came with a movie. Horror, I believe. You like that shit? - Yeah, I like it a lot. - I saw the first couple of minutes of it. Something about a group of people wearing robes and saying weird things. Not my cup of tea. (groaning) So here, take this home with you. I need to get it out of here for a while. - Oh, I couldn't take this. - My way of saying thanks. I'll find you when I need it. - Vinnie. (keys clicking) Vinnie Scotto. Street Hustler. Jeez, you scared me. - Oh yeah, you think that was scary, what about this? (growls) Johnson wants all of the tapes inventoried. By the day after tomorrow. Are you through with that already? - Yep. - Now listen, and listen good. There's nothing in these boxes, get it. Empty. Teenage Zombie Nurses In Chains. A little something for extra credit in biology huh? You wanna know what we do to people that try and rip us off? We tie 'em up and make 'em watch tapes of Sesame Street backwards. That way they don't know what order the alphabets in. So did you fill out that application? We might as well get you in here to patrol the place. Damn, can't those yo yo's read? Look at this, half these tapes aren't rewound. - Here you go. I sort of improved a few things, like my former jobs. - Let's see. Assistant Manager, Frosty Queen Ice Cream Store. Bag Boy, Piggly Wiggly Grocery Store. Director of Marketing, Big Wally's Hamburgers. You made quite a big jump from bag boy didn't you? - Yeah, Big Wally was a great guy. He used to let me make the posters for the specials. - Oh and that makes you Director of Marketing huh? Well then I must Queen of Inventory Analysis. So how's the great American novel coming? - Oh, I just came up with a great start for it. I met this guy named Vinnie. I helped him out actually, he was getting beat up. All pretty interesting actually. - Somebody got beat up, that sounds great. This city's a laugh a minute. - Anyway, he kind of, sort of, gave me a VCR, his way of saying thanks. I think I can use him, you know as a character in my novel. - Wait, a guy named Vinnie kind of, sort of gives you a VCR. I wonder who's using who? - No, it's not like that at all. He's a really nice guy. He even gave me a movie. Jill, I'd like to ask you something. - Yeah. - See, since I've been coming here I was just wondering-- (clears throat) I've been thinking that maybe. - Nazi Rectal Round Up. You are disgusting and perverted. - Thank you ma'am. Could I have a paper bag please? - I'd rather put it in the trash, and you along with it. Now get out of here before I call the Humane Society. You were saying? - Well I got this horror movie with the VCR and uh, I just thought, you know-- - Look, save your money Andy. I don't like horror movies, they scare me. (ominous music) You know you've got a hell of a smile. - Hey. (ominous music) Hey what the heck? - [Vinnie] Shut the door. - Hey, that's not for you. - This is very interesting. You know, you're a talented guy. I like it a lot. Only uh, don't think street hustler's a bit harsh? - Vinnie, how'd you get in? - You really ought to get a better lock. That is Joey. I thought he was up for five. I'd like to offer you an employment opportunity. Would only take a few hours out of evening now and then. So of course you'd have to time to continue your writing. Here, I brought you some beer. Sound interesting? - Vinnie, I don't think, I'm really qualified to-- - You know how to drive? - [Andy] Yeah. - Then you have the experience. You can start tonight. - Vinnie I can't. I, I may have someone coming over this evening. - Why didn't you say so? Maybe some other time, unless of course you get a writing job first. If it's experience you want, you came to the right place. These city girls were born with it. Do her a favor, take her out to dinner. Call it an advance. - Vinnie, I. I'm trying too hard. That's it. (groaning) - [Film Alien] We need solitude. - [TV Man] Oh my God, oh no. Oh my God! - A certain type is attracted to these fringe religious groups. They're confused, depressed or searching, looking for something. I think we live in a culture that's fostered an upsurge in these things lately. - Dr. Lyleson, we've heard a lot of rumors about a local group that combines ancient rituals with modern techniques. - Yeah, I'm familiar with this group. By utilizing the focus of brain waves, alpha energy actually, which is a modern day meditative technique. (static buzzing) (ominous music) (static buzzing) (ghostly whispering) - Hey what do you need? We're closing early for inventory. We're close pal. - But, I know what I want. - You know what you want? - Is Jill around? - Mindkiller, have you got Mindkiller on VHS? - Sorry buddy, we can't keep that one in stock. Hey, you ever see that one? It's really pretty funny. - No, I'm just looking for Jill. - I can see it. - Look, we're closed get lost. What are you a cop? Jill left a while ago, now you need a tape or not? - Uh, I guess so. (man shouting) - You uh, you a member? - A member no. - You didn't look it either. You're gonna need a major credit card and an ID then. - Oh, I don't have a major credit card. - How long you known Jill? - [Andy] I just moved her a couple of weeks ago. - Ah, she was born and grew up right here you know. That brown two flat on Horino? Her old man ran the dry cleaners downstairs, right 'til the day he died. I, I don't know what keeps her in the neighborhood. (laughs) Adults only, no kids. This means you punk. Ah, Jill's a pretty good kid. As soon as you get past that wise ass attitude. So uh, how's your writing coming Shakespeare? - Wait a minute, how'd you know? - Oh, Jill's talked a lot about you. You get these back by two tomorrow or it's gonna cost you two days, you got it? (ominous music) (VCR clicking) (static buzzing) (ghostly chanting) (groaning) - [Andy Voiceover] He entered the store promptly at eight with an air of confidence about him. - So, where do I start? - Well, you're certainly prompt. There's a lot to learn, come behind the counter for starters. (peaceful music) - Her amazement could barely be contained as he immediately took control of the situation in his usual masterful way. She chuckled endearingly as she told the frightened kid. She chuckled endearingly as he told the frightened kid. "That's right backwards, "that way you don't know the order of the alphabet." Now go. She touched him on the shoulders, the kid scampered off. "You know," she said with a twinkle in her eye. - You're gonna work out great here. How about dinner? It's my neighborhood so I'll treat. - He could see this was the beginning of something special. (clattering) Don't these people ever sleep? I need, I need some inspiration. (static buzzing) (ghostly chanting) - Sounds familiar. Where have I? Oh, all these movies are starting to blend together. (clattering) - [Woman] You get away from me. - [Man] That's it bitch, I'd had it with your shit. - [Woman] Go ahead, try it Mr. Big Shot. - [Man] Don't come any closer, I'm warning you girl. - [Woman] I'm gonna kick your ass. - [Man] Put that lamp down you crazy bitch, I'm warning you. (gun firing) (glass smashes) (footsteps clicking) (ominous music) (door clattering) - A fashion statement or are you just concealing some biological aberration? Here, I brought you something. That's right, a beautiful work of art. Or for those of us who are native to this planet, something to eat. You missed a good time the other night. What happened to all the beer? (belches) Tell me, was your date impressed by you colloquial Kansas manners? - It didn't work out, she couldn't make it. - The energy lives through an innocent. It releases it's power when the being is receptive. What kind of shit is this? - I didn't write that. - Whoa, whoa. Could have used one of these last night? - How did that get there? - Tennessee Chainsaw Barbecue. No wonder your date couldn't make it. Writer's block? Let me help you. - Vinnie-- - I got another job tonight. - Vinnie that was in my hands all night. Something is not making sense here. - I believe that's someone. Listen Kansas, I could use your help. - Look Vinnie, I'm not cut out to be-- - Be what? Say it. - I'm just not like you alright? - What the hell's that supposed to mean? - A thief alright, I'm not cut out to be a thief. - A thief? After all I've done for you, you have the nerve to call me a thief right to my face? - I didn't ask you to do anything for me. - I didn't ask you to play hero in the alley either pal. So we're even. Thief. - It's just that I know what's going on okay. I mean, you think I'm some stupid John boy hick from the prairie. - Cut the melodrama pal. Nobody, especially not you, talks to me like that, understand. I've about had it with you. - Vinnie, Vinnie wait. My neighbors almost killed each other last night. They actually started shooting at each other. - This is the big city okay, wise up. There's assholes around okay. Go back to Kansas if you can't handle it. - Knock it off Vinnie. I'm not about to get swallowed up by this nightmare you call a city. My neighbors actually started shooting at each other last night and I. (melancholy music) (keys clicking) (wistful music) (clattering) (wistful music) - [Men Together] Buffalo, buffalo, buffalo, buffalo. Buffalo, buffalo-- (whoopee cushion mimics flatulence) (laughing) - Same time every Thursday. Now watch, the big guys pulls his truck around then he goes inside to set the alarm and close up shop. Same routine every time. He always parks his car on Crawford Street. - [Vinnie] You think Ben can handle him? - [Crook] Lots always dark by this time, Ben could take him out before he ever knows what hit him. - Then all we gotta do is worry about the little guy. And about 150 TV sets. - Yeah, I have truck lined up do you have a driver here? - I'm working on that right now. I've got the perfect person in mind. - Good, that way if the truck is pulled over we don't take the fall. - Shit cops. (suspenseful music) What's the matter with you man? I thought you checked this out. - I did man, I did. - Shh, shh, shh. - Those aren't cops. No one patrols this area on foot anymore. Look, look, at 'em. - Those guys. They tried to re-arrange my face the other day. (suspenseful music) (suspenseful music) I got the video machine from an apartment up there. It must have been theirs. Who are they? - I wouldn't worry about 'em. Merle says they're Hare Khrisna's. - What? - Some religious group that parties up there. I'm sure they're harmless man. - I don't know man. Something here just ain't right. (distant chanting) - I'm telling you that's how I got it. - Look Jack, the tapes busted. You had it last, it's that simple. Now give me the money. - So do I get the job or not? - I don't know, come back tonight, it's up to Ed. - I mean, I came to see you too. I sort of hoped you'd come by the other night. - You're amazing, I don't even know you. - Sure you do. I'm Andy Archer. And I like your smile too. - You look tired. - Hmm, I'm pretty possess, I mean obsessed, with my writing I mean. And my neighbors. I'm not even making sense. Jill I have got to get out and see some real people again. - So how's the story on Vinnie coming along? - Oh, it's all dried up. We had a fight sort of. God, I need a story. I need a story I can get my soul into, you know? Jill. Can I talk to you alone? - What is this a come on? - No, it's not. - Okay look, come back about four o'clock, you can talk to Ed then and we'll go for a walk. - Four o'clock. (melancholy music) - [Jill] Hey look, I think Ed's gonna give you the job. Your mother will be happy I'm sure. So what's the matter? - Well, you know this guy Vinnie I was telling you about? - Yeah the guy that kind of, sort of gave you a VCR. - Yeah, I think I made him mad, I mean really mad. - Why? What'd you do? - I said some things I shouldn't have. I don't think he has many friends you know, he's always coming over. Bringing me beer and money. And he knows how to get into my room, I think he's trying to scare me. - Whoa, whoa, wait, hold it right there. Look Andy, get your locks changed and watch the kind of people you get hooked up with. There's a lot of weirdo's out there. Come on. (wistful music) (brakes screeching) - See what I mean? It's always like this, day and night. I hardly get any sleep anymore. - Andy, just relax. - I wish I could. Nothing is going right for me. - Yeah, I know what you mean. Hey look, forget what I said about the locks. I think you should fame and fortune somewhere else. I'm telling you this for your own good, I know what this place can do to people. Hey, what do you say we go get dinner someplace nice? My neighborhood, I'll buy. - That's amazing, those are the exact words. Nevermind. - Come on. (wistful music) (ominous music) - Anybody there? (ghostly whispering) Vinnie is that you? Oh. You left it on. (ominous music) (static buzzing) (clock ticking) (ghostly whispering) (ominous music) (ominous music) (clears throat) (wind howls) - I thought I locked that. (ominous music) - [Andy Voiceover] Locking the door he senses an ominous presence behind him. - Who's there? - He slowly walks towards the glow. We see it intensify on his face. Despite his fear, the beckoning voices draw him in toward the eerie glow, until suddenly he screams as a large gash appears on his neck. Screams that dissolve into traffic noises. (ominous music) Oh my god. (VCR buzzes) Hey, I, I thought I was dreaming. How'd I get here? (door knocking) - For Christ's sake hold on, What the hell do you want? - What are you trying to do to me Vinnie? - I have no idea what you're talking about small potatoes. (locks clicking) - Sneaking around in the dark, trying to scare me. I figured out what's going on. - You haven't figured out shit. You're scaring yourself with those monster movies you watch. - Don't give me that Vinnie. - Look punk. How the hell can I even call you a punk? You're just a goddamn kid. Look, I don't know what's bothering you, but just calm down. Want a beer? - Yeah. - This is becoming real terradactical. You're the one who jerks me around and then you're acussin-- - You mean paradoxical? - Like I said. Let's get one thing clear. Vinnie Scotto is a man with style. And creeping around dumps to play the boogeyman is not my style, understand? If I have something to tell you, I tell you like a man. To your face. You hear me chump? - So you're not upset with me accusing you of coming over-- - Yeah I'm upset. I'm sort of upset now. But I'm more pissed at your attitude. See, you think this is some kind of adventure. A trip to the zoo to see where the funny animals live. Well it is the zoo. Except I have to stay here in my cage, 'cause if I get out, then the bigger animals hear about it. They like to hurt the little guys, so I have to keep moving, keep hiding. But I'm smarter and faster than they are. I'm just like the bigger animals, especially when something weak gets in my way. And if it does, believe you and me, I'm gonna settle the score once and for all. - Look Vinnie, all I wanted-- - All you wanted to do was watch us die in this garbage heap so you'd have something interesting to put in that little book of yours. Something hot and exciting that they don't have back in shit hole Kansas. - Hey go to hell Vinnie. - I'm already there Junior, and so are you. (ominous music) (people chattering) - What's going on here? Please, I work here, what's going on? - What's your name son? - Andy Archer, I'm looking for a girl named Jill, is she okay? - She's okay, she's inside. You work here? - Yeah I work, please what happened here? - The place was completely trashed last night. - Can you think of anyone that might have had access? - Look, I have no idea who else has a key. People are coming and going in this place all the time. I doubt that he changes the locks every time somebody splits. I've had it with this neighborhood. How many times have I said that? Poor Ed. - Jill is he? - Well Archer, you picked a great day to start. Go on home, we're not opening today. - The place was trashed but no money taken, the strangest thing. You're new in the neighborhood, I haven't seen you around. You noticed anyone suspicious hanging around here lately? Yeah well, here's my card. Give me a call if you think of anything. (wistful music) - Why Ed? (ominous music) (ghostly whispering) (moaning) (static buzzing) (keys clicking) - Ben Turmond feels hot breath on his neck. Ben Turmond? His mouth drops open in fear and he slowly turns as if to face the inevitable. The figure steps out of the dark alley, he is frozen with fear. The figure approaches. Ben tries to scream but fear has tightened it's grip on his throat. (brakes screeching) (metal crashing) (ominous music) The job's fine. I'm okay, I'm just a little tired. I just said I was okay. I got some stories published. Yeah. Scary ones. Yeah they said they were the scariest they'd ever seen. Uh, I'm writing now like crazy you know. Uh, I'm going out with a girl. Jill. She's real nice, you'd like her. Look I got to go, okay. - Hey Archer, how can you afford a date when you can't even pay the rent? - You know it's not very nice to listen in on people's phone conversations. - Look Archer, I told you the day you moved in-- - What do you think? They're the latest rage in Paris this year. Well if it isn't our very own Hemingway. How's the biz Tiger? Now Miss Sapperstein. - You're on your own honey, I ain't no locksmith. I gave you the last that I had last time, remember. And I ain't no bank either. Like I was saying, you remember the rules. - I've got it right here, for next week too. I bet I make it double with this next story. - My my, our man from the heartlands certainly has blossomed. Well it looks like I'm out on the streets again tonight. - Somehow I think you'll manage. - I know, I know. It's nobody's fault but my own. It's amazing what a month in this town can do for some people. (door clattering) - I could use a drink. It ain't much but we cal it home. You want one? - Oh no thanks. This place is great. No really, you should see my room. - You look like you haven't slept in quite a while. - Jill, my writing is really taking off. Ideas are just flowing out of me. I just sit back and they happen. - And they're making you this jumpy? What are they keeping you up all night? - Well, something does happen at night, in my room. I'm watching TV and then I doze off and I start having these weird dreams. And the next thing I was just sitting next-- - Maybe you'd be interested in something that happens in my room at night? You're nice, that's what I like about you. You're just so goddamn nice. - Um, sorry about well. I know I was acting kind of, I don't know. I just get so excited. You know, for a while there I was really scared. Nothing was working out. I just, I was afraid, I wasn't cut out to be a writer. - Yeah well, this city will do that to you. I mean, look what it's done to me. Andy. Have you ever been with a woman before? - Hey Jill, I mean, I like you. - Look. There's always a first time, for everybody. There's nothing to be ashamed of. - What are you talking about? - You know what I'm talking about. First time, you know. Like the first time you rode a two wheel bike. The first time you went swimming. - Swimming? I've been swimming hundreds of times. - Really? You wouldn't lie to me would you? - Well, I haven't been swimming all that much. There's just not that much water in Kansas. (peaceful music) (moaning) - Hey. You just relax. Just relax. (sobbing) (peaceful music) (moaning) Every morning it's the same old news. All the shootings, the stabbings, the murders that go on around here. Right here. God Andy, I'm so scared. I'm scared I'm never gonna get out of this place. (electrical buzzing) - But it's not even plugged in. This is incredible. (ominous music) (static buzzing) (woman screams) (ghostly whispering) (static buzzing) (door knocking) - [Miss Sapperstein] Andy you in there? Andy, what's going on in there? - Nothing, everything's fine. - The telephone. (static buzzing) - Hi mom. - That's okay, I've been called worse. - [Andy] Jill, it's just that I never get any phone calls except from my mom. - Yeah well, you can tell her you got someone else in your life now huh? - Yeah. - Listen, I just wanted to call and thank you for being with me yesterday. Something happened to me last night. - Thank me? Are you kidding, I should be the one to say thank you. I mean. - Andy. Andy. - Jill, the thing is stranger than I thought. - What are you talking about? Listen, I'd really like to see you again. - Good. - Okay. (wistful music) Andy come on, go to sleep you need to rest. - I thought I had it figured out. It has something to do with that video machine. It would make an incredible story-- - Shh Andy, come on. - What? This could be the best thing that's ever happened to me. - Oh is that right? Then just where do I fit in? - What are you so upset about? I'm talking about by stories. Jill, look we're here together in this city. - Goddammit Andy, I don't wanna talk about the city, or your stories. Come on Andy, let's just go to sleep okay. Come on. - Jill, I just don't understand. - That's right, you don't understand. You don't understand what you're getting yourself into. Andy you have the most incredible eyes. Come on look at me, look at me. (laughs) God they take in everything. You don't understand what that can do to you here. - No, I don't think you understand. I mean, that is what makes me a writer. - Goddammit Andy, you can't be like that in this city. - Look, I don't wanna talk about the city okay. - Yeah well great that makes two of us. - I guess you're right. My mother would like you. I do open myself up to everything. I opened myself up to you, you of all people. - Hold me, just hold me. Andy. - Hmm-mm. - Promise me we'll go away for a while. Just go somewhere, please. - Let's go to sleep like you said. You could feel her sense of desperation as Jill lay close. As he began to stir, she clutched him tighter whispering "no, no, don't move, stay right there." She looks away and then says softly "since I met you I can't explain it. "Everything's different Andy." - Ooh, sounds sweet. You must Andy, you're all Jill talks about these days. (laughing) Oh hey, doesn't bother me, if it doesn't bother you. I've seen it all before. Although, I don't recall seeing you here before. (laughing) You got a light? Oh. Oh hey. (laughing) I was just about ready to wake you up. Jill said to make sure that you go to work by 10. (laughing) Oh shit, look at these, they're all wrinkled. (gasps) Oh well (laughs). Oh hey, what are you stories about? - Oh just anything that pops up. (laughing) - That Jill was right about you. - Thanks a lot. - Thank you. - Detective Hartley, I'd like to ask you a few questions. You live across the street don't you? Denmark? - Yeah why? - Where were you last Tuesday night? The night of the break in? - What? - You went out late that night. - No wait a minute, you don't think. I was with my friend Vinnie, you can ask him. - That trash bin outside your window. - How do you know which window? - I'll ask the questions. - You notice who's been dumping their garbage in it the past few days? - I don't really pay attention to that kind of thing. I need to get back to work. - We found a towel in that trash bin. Soaked with blood. We ran it through the police laboratory. It's blood from a cat. The group we've been chasing gets its kicks from slitting open cats. Archer I may need to ask you some questions later. - Am I a suspect? - Just doing my job. We're here to help you know. - What was that all about? Earth to Andy. Are you okay? - No. No I'm not. (ominous music) - These suckers are getting bold man. Grabbing stereos on a busy street like this. So you wrote a story about this Johnson guy getting killed and something happens to him, so what? - Vinnie, it's more than that. I am not writing these things. I don't know where they're coming from. And they're getting worse. - Yeah yeah, so you putting your name on someone else's stories and you think I'm a thief. - Vinnie, I don't know how but, they're getting so gruesome. Especially this last one, some guy gets his throat slit in an alley. (ominous music) And the somebody carves a snake right into his skin. - Let's continue this meeting elsewhere okay. (ghostly chanting) - Hey what's that? - Hey hey. Rumor has it that a badass version of these hairy Christmas characters hang out around here. - Hare Krishna. - Like I said, now listen to me I've got something we need to talk about. - Where is that coming from? - Never mind that goddammit, now listen to me. There's gonna be a poker game Friday night at my place. - The chanting, on the tape, that's where I heard it. Jeez, this is incredible. - I'm losing my patience with you. - Vinnie, I gotta go home. - Be there Friday Kansas. What is it with these kids today? They got no motivation. - Yeah right. - Hey you guys? (gasps) You need some help with that? Look guys, stand back alright, let me show you how it's done. (electrical buzzing) - The invisible force threw her to the bed with incredible strength. And her entire body was locked in its demonic grip. Before she could scream. (door knocking) - God you weren't kidding about this place. What were you typing? - Typing? - Yeah I heard you typing. - Jill, I'm really tired-- - Yeah well maybe you should take a break. I came over here to take your mind off of. I brought us a tape to watch. No more of that spooky stuff, you are going to love this. Debbie Does Brooklyn, and a portion of Long Island. It comes highly recommended, you will love it. - Jill I would like to, but I can't. - You know, if I didn't know better, I'd think you were suffering from a lack of affection. - Jill, you don't understand. - You got another girl. I mean what chick could resist such an upscale pad? And such quality furnishings. - Please. - Oh and then you prepare a fine dinner featuring that international favorite pork and beans al Andy. Then you got 'em in the palm of your hand. What's the matter? I'm just too much woman for this innocent little country boy, aren't I? That's it isn't it? That's no problem, I'll just-- (laughing) (moaning) Well, maybe I was a little bit hasty there. No, no don't move. Stay right there. - What'd you say? - You know Andy, since I met you. - [Together] I can't explain it, everything's different. - No, no, no, no I can't believe this just happened. - What? - This is too weird. I just wrote this very scene. - What are you talking about? - God I wish I knew. (ominous music) - Hey when are you gonna let me read some of those stories of yours? Hmm? - They're horror stories, they scare you remember? - That's right. - [Man] Last one, I'm telling you last one. - Hey, I'm busy in here man. Get the fuck out of here. - [Woman] Everything, day in and day out. - [Man] How can you be sick and tired when all you do is lay on the couch all day long? - [Woman] I have been reading every-- (ominous music) (electrical buzzing) - [Man] Well you cooking something now? Is that what that plate is for huh? - [Woman] I'll show you what I'm gonna do with this plate. - Hey, that's my favorite plate! (plate smashes) What's happening man? (ominous music) (laughs) - Okay Andy, where's the camera? (door squeaking) Andy? (electrical buzzing) Ow. - So these two nuns walk into a bar and the next thing you know is that? (snoring) - Allow me. - He's an expert at this. (drunken mumbling) (static buzzing) (screaming) - Jill! (panting) What? Jill what? (sobbing) Jill what? What happened? - The TV, the TV. - What Jill? - The TV, it was me. It was me on the TV. - Are you okay? (sobbing) (upbeat rock music) (belches) (door knocking) ♪ I call my friends out in East LA - Well looks who's here. (locks clicking) Tonight's bankroll's 50 bucks. Ready to join the big boys. - Here you can have this back. - You can't redeem yourself that easily. You've been using it, so you're tainted too my friend. - No, no please, please take it. - Come on Vinnie, it's your deal. - Who's this? - He's Andy. Come on, deal me in boys. This is Earl, Jimmy and Ben Turmond. (ominous music) - One Eyed Jacks was wild huh? - Not this time pal. No poker face huh. - Look Vinnie, I got to go. - Do me a favor, put that back where you got it. We're gonna play out a couple more hands and then we're gonna discuss the details of tomorrows job. - Vinnie, there's something I've gotta tell you. - Let me guess, you don't like what I do huh? That's why you brought it back. - No. It's haunted. - Well maybe we should do an exorcism. - Vinnie, it's about Ben. - Enough of your bullshit Kansas. I've had enough of you. Help me tomorrow night. All you've gotta do is keep an eye on the truck. It's on Third and Palaski, now you be there then we'll be square. - Vinnie please. - Can it, I've had about enough of you. I don't wanna see you after this. Our relationship will be terminated, understand? - Ben, keep an eye on that punk. Make sure he don't flake out on me. I want him here tomorrow night. (ominous music) (electrical buzzing) (door knocking) - (yawns) If that's you Kansas I'm getting very tired of your wake up calls. - Detective Hartley police. (locks clicking) I have a few questions to ask you. You know someone by the name of Andy Archer? Did he visit you late last night? Mind if I come in. - What's this all about? - Homicide found a body in a back alley a few blocks from here. Identification said Ben Turmond. - Ben? - You know him? - Yeah he's my buddy. Ben's dead, what happened? - His throat was slit, looks like somebody snuck up on him. - Shit. Anything else? - Yeah, he had a snake carved in his arm. Why do you ask? - Vinnie Scotto does not talk to a cop without a lawyer present. I believe our conversation has ended. - As he carved the snake into his flesh, he knew the sacrifice was complete. The snake is the sign of truth. The symbol of true brotherhood. (ominous music) (door knocking) - [Miss Sapperstein] Archer, telephone. (ominous music) - Vinnie hi. - The heat was just here, I didn't let on about you. 'Cause I'm gonna get you first. - What are you talking about? - Crazy son of a bitch. Ben, that's what I'm talking about. - Has Andy Archer left this morning yet? - No, he was just on the phone. Say what do you think about these Red Sox eh? Hey what's he done anyway? He's the only halfway normal one we've got here. (suspenseful music) (door knocking) - Thanks. (ominous music) (doorbell buzzes) - [Wendy] Yeah who is it? - Come on Jill, let me in. - [Wendy] She's not here Andy. - Wendy please where is she? (doorbell buzzes) - [Wendy] I don't know where she is Andy. You know she's been a nervous wreck since you she left you last night. - Wendy please, something terrible's happened. But Vinnie doesn't understand. Jill's the only one I can talk to. - [Wendy] I told you, I don't know where she is. Just listen to yourself Andy. - Alright, alright. They're onto me Wendy, but I think I figured it out, why it happened. I've got something she has to see. Somebody's got to believe me. - [Wendy] What are you talking about? - I'm waiting in the lobby, alright. The truth within these pages. Come on now Wendy help me. (gasps) - It's you. How the hell you get in here? - [Man] I'm looking for a stolen videotape. I understand you might know where it is. - Well you understand wrong. (groans) - [Man] We tried talking to you once before. We won't try again. (ominous music) - [Andy] Close the door. - Jesus, how the hell did you get in here? - Fire escape. - You got a lot of nerve. - Now wait a minute Vinnie, you can't believe I have anything to do with Ben. Why would I have come here if I did? - How do you know so much about it? - It was just a story. I keep telling you, I'm not writing these things. - Because of you the police are on my tail. I have to liquidate my inventory. You have done nothing but cost me money. You're gonna make it up to be goddammit. - I will, I swear anything. Just help me out of this mess. - On your way up here did you see a strange looking character going out? - Yeah I did see someone kind of weird walking down the street, why? - I think he may have some answers for us. Did you see which way he went? - I saw the building. It was where we heard the chanting the other night. - Come on, here. I'm not turning my back on you. (suspenseful music) (distant ghostly chanting) (dramatic music) (whoopee cushion mimics flatulence) - That was a good one. - But I don't have the cushion. (laughing) - You know you're right. You couldn't have possibly have done any of this, you're too stupid. - Um, Andy left this. I think we better call the police. - What? (ominous music) - I think this is what he's been looking for. (electrical buzzing) - No, no turn it off. (electrical buzzing) (static buzzing) - It sounds like he was mixed up with those cultists. Hell, according to this he might be their leader. - I'm telling you, Andy didn't plan any of that. I mean look at him, such easy prey. - The snake. That's our proof. You're lucky to be alive young lady. - Hey that's bullshit man. Andy's in trouble, we gotta help him. - Jill no, I don't know. - What else do you know? - I don't know, I think he's in trouble with some Vinnie guy. - Vinnie Scotto? Figures. Detective Hartley here. Send a backup unit to 221 Wesley, Apartment Two D. It's that Scotto punk again. You two stay right here, we'll take care of it. - Hey no way, I'm coming with. (static buzzing) (ghostly chanting) - This is how it always started. I'd hear this and then-- (ominous music) (ghostly chanting) (static buzzing) - It's on the tape. The evil force they created, it was recorded onto the video tape. Of course, it's not the TV. The force is on the video tape. Vinnie that was you. (screams) - Wait, where have I seen that shit before? - It's yours. - No, it's from the stories. How'd they get on here? - Detective's right, that was you. (electrical buzzing) (ghostly chanting) - You shouldn't have stolen the tape Vinnie. (groaning) (ghostly chanting) - This is Detective Hartley open up. (groaning) (ghostly chanting) (static buzzing) - You get away from me, you crazy son of a bitch. - Andy open the door. - Freeze! - He's crazy, he tried to kill me. (groaning) - Andy. (sobbing) - I just watched this. All the evidence you'll need is right here. We were just fooling around. - You better come with us. - Now wait, whoa. (static buzzing) (handcuffs clicking) - No, Andy. Please. (wistful music) - [Hospital Announcer] Dr. Claire, Dr. Claire. Dr. J. Hamilton, Dr. J. Hamilton. (keys clicking) (wistful music) - Andy. I know this wasn't your fault. I'm gonna get you out of here real soon, I promise. And we'll go away from all this. (sobbing) We'll go back to Kansas. Andy, oh Andy. - [Nurse] It's time for his lunch. - No. No. - [Nurse] I'm afraid you're going to have to leave. - Andy. - [Nurse] No visitors are allowed on this floor. (sobbing) - Andy. (wistful music) (keys clicking) - [Andy Voiceover] She innocently entered my room, unaware of the force that would soon possess her and destroy her. - I'm the new nurse on the floor. (keys clicking) What you writing? You know I once thought about being a writer, but hey, you know how that goes. Don't talk much huh? Well that's okay. I'm kind of the same way myself. - I've written a story about you. (ominous music) (keys clicking) (upbeat music)
