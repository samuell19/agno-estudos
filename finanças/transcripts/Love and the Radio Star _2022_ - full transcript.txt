(sighing) I quit. Pardon me? Nothing to do with you or this place. My time here has been a dream. Okay, so why are you quitting? I want more. Oh, like, more like a raise. Cool. - More out of life. - Okay, I don't understand. I swore to myself I'd never go back to corporate PR, but, look, here I am. This is crazy, okay? You are about to be the hottest image consultant in Manhattan! You're just going to walk away from that? I'm going to focus on my wellness vlog. Become an influencer? - A life coach. - Life coach... I already have a few thousand followers, I just need to build momentum. We can ease up on the workload. Easy. Let's do it. Clara. Thank you, but no. Is there anything I can say to keep you? There isn't. So, now that that's settled, I want to talk about you guys. Steve, you need to give yourself more "me" time. So, I booked you Taiko drum lessons. I mean, you've been talking about it for years, so get after it, okay? Clara. I got you a National Parks passport. So you can go on some mother-daughter trips with Kim and collect stamps together. And I realize that HR isn't fully utilizing their wellness budget, so I got an automated massage chair for the staff on this floor since they've been working overtime. It's in my old office which is now a Zen room. Image is important, that's what we do here, but finding real balance in life is what's crucial to thrive. Oh! Oh! He won! Morris won the primary!

No, that was a good job. A secure job. That was a shallow PR job. What if you need to find a job and you can't because you've been out of the game so long? I'll still going to be doing image consulting on the side. I'm just going to pivot it into life coach with the vlog.

I'm Savannah Joy and in this video I'm reviewing skin care masks. Now, I have everything from cleansing masks to hydration masks. I've tried gel, sheet, mud, clay. Everything so that you don't have to! Now, this mask, which is a rosemary and honey mask, is actually my favorite! It's not too dry. My favorite, too! Sorry. Action! Hi! Welcome back to Finding the Me Between the Beauty and the Mess. I'm Savannah Joy and in this video... ♪ Woman: Is that Ellie?! Sorry, I couldn't get a sitter. No worries! I'm a big fan of your vlog so she's kind of like a celebrity to me. (laughing) I'd be honored to hang out with you while your mom has her job interview. I'm Alisha. Thank you so much for the opportunity. Well, you've been posting about your consulting work nonstop, so I made a few calls and everyone has raved about you. Hey, do you have any, uh, sleep wellness advice? You know, actually, I have a post coming up about that! The trick is ritual and treating yourself a little. Alisha: Hm. Anyway, Patrick is wrapping up, so can I get you anything? No. You guys want a tour? (chuckling) Come on. (Ellie gasping) This is so cool! Mm-hm. So, as you probably know, we are the number five interview talk radio show in New York. We used to be number one until a few years ago. Man: I mean, you are New York's hottest club right now! I mean, from the models in the glass cubes just lounging around and reading books to the wall of furry bath mats, it's edgy by being nonsensical! Patrick likes to use both booths to record. - It's almost saying that... - (phone pinging) - Being immature is in. - (sighing) I'm sorry. Why don't you wait right here? Patrick: That absurd is the new normal. Can you hear me? Yes. (giggling) So, Ellie, can you tell me where Grandma took you the other day? Museum of Teddy Bears. Grandma liked it. She was nice to take me, but... I heard that the club's DJ wears a five gallon bucket on his head. So cool. (Patrick laughing) What did you think of it, Ellie? I mean, I'm a little old for that stuff. It was kinda immature. I heard it was popular? I guess, but I'm not four. Who's talking? Hey, Vince. How's it going in there? Ellie: We had to wait in a long line outside on the sidewalk just to get in. When we got in it was so crowded, these girls were screaming, taking selfies. I don't know what the big deal is. Who cares?! Well, I guess it was over-hyped. Stop talking! Hello? My voice is so deep. Like a man. Mary Sullivan, please report to detention! You picked your nose! (laughing) So, Ellie, right? How old are you? Ten. Overrated or not. Green Juice? Ew. Green juice?! $10 artisan cupcakes? I make cupcakes with my mom. Well, you heard it, New York, straight talk from a 10-year old critic. You decide on the hype! And, well, what's your name? Patrick! Savannah Joy. And what do you do, Savannah? How do you see yourself, Patrick? - What's he doing? - Patrick: Composed. Cultured. Charming. Hmph. Well, I'm a suit connoisseur. Watch enthusiast. I love all things bespoke. Always hustling. Always seeking the truth. Very stylish in a medium where you're invisible to your audience. You mean radio? - Savannah: Calculated. - Confident. Or closed off? Guess I do wear a suit of armor. Charming, perhaps. Thanks. I won't push it. I'm a life coach, which includes image consulting, helping people with their public image. Usually start-up CEO's, politicians. I analyze their appearance, behavior, communication, anything that might affect their professional image and I give recommendations. I can help you. Well, you heard it New York, do I need help? Let me know! This is Spreading the News with Patrick Dillon. Are we live?! Every morning. Savannah: Did all of New York just-- Patrick: Hear you flirting with me? - Yeah. - I wasn't flirting. Yeah, some people wouldn't qualify that as flirting. More awkward. (chuckling) I am very good at flirting! We're still broadcasting, Savannah. You hit the live button. Uh... Yeah. So, give me a second. I am so sorry. We were in here waiting for the interview and I thought when you came in you were just playing along. No, I was turning this gaff into a skit. Are we still going to do the image consulting gig interview? No. Cute kid though. My fault. They prepped this room to record and then moved on. I... I didn't know. Thank you for the opportunity. I'm sorry. Come on, babe. (groaning) ♪ (knocking) Hey. So, uh... Tenth floor wants an update on our co-host search. Yeah, I gave them names months ago. And none were approved. Do you know that you're trending on social media? And in a good way for once. Hm. "Patrick Dillon needs a makeover, yes!" "For a minute, he seemed like a guy I could have a beer with." "Maybe she can turn him into someone who's not such a stuck up--" Okay, people like to see me stumble. It's Schadenfreude. Alisha: And why is that? She called you out and New York was charmed. Charmed is a strong word. You called yourself charming. Look, a makeover by her could be your ticket to building up your listener numbers! Maybe even get you that Best of NYC Award after all these years. Yeah, you're just a fan of hers! I am, but this proves that she is the perfect consultant to bring you back down to Earth. I mean, she made-over Morris. Do I look like a dive bar owner? Okay. Let's be real. Your declining listenership is why they want a cohost. And The Times said-- I know what the Times said. You seem "more focused on insider gossip of the rich and powerful than the concerns of the average New Yorker." Listen, I know this may sound crazy, but I think we may have found a good co-host candidate to pitch to the tenth floor. Who? Her?! Yeah! They will absolutely get on board! Her vlog followers are literally the demographic you score poorly with, but our advertisers covet. You're kidding. No! She will balance and call you out, just like Howard Stern and Robin Quivers, or Regis and Kelly. This is a joke, right? I feel that she'll bring something you lack. A more grounded, less pretentious perspective. You wouldn't throw a clown into a lion's den. Then give me more co-host names! No problem. That the tenth floor will approve. Listen, we're mashing two potatoes with one fork. And it's not like she's not some seasoned co-host that the tenth floor will fall in love with and replace you with. She's a newbie. Exactly, which is why this is straight up insulting. You're sinking, Patrick, and from where I stand, she is your best chance at saving your show. Get her for the consulting gig and co-host, or I guarantee you the tenth floor will not renew your contract at the end of the season. ♪ Hi, everyone. Savannah here, and Ellie and I are having a creative day as part of our wellness routine! (phone ringing) (clearing throat) Hi, it's Savannah here, and-- - (phone ringing) - Who is this person?! Should have put it in airplane mode. Hello? Savannah! Patrick Dillon. Savannah: You just called me like eight times, why didn't you leave a message? Because you picked up. Listen, I'm sorry about yesterday. Patrick: Ah, water under the bridge. Okay, great. Can I still come in for the interview? No need. You're hired! That's fantastic news. Thank you. One little request. Instead of just the image consulting job, we will double your fee if you join me on the show as a cohost! That's funny, Patrick, are we on the air? Nope. So, is it a deal? Savannah: No. No? Look, I appreciate the vote of confidence, but I have zero interest in becoming a radio host. Patrick: Well, you wouldn't be a host per se. More of a trial run as side act. You're really selling this. Listen, I've got my own priorities. What priorities? Face cream? Patrick, I'd be flattered to take the consulting gig, but no thanks to the show! But we had such a connection, Savannah. I need to go. I thought you wanted this gig? I do but we are taking a tour of a school and work does not interfere with my daughter. Patrick: Okay, let's close this deal now. I can talk tomorrow. Bye. Savannah! (bell ringing) We also have a rooftop greenhouse, historic chapel, and new this year is a resident archaeologist. Of course all of this is to prepare students for the wonderful world they'll inherit. Of course. Contact me if you have any further questions. The tuition? Last page. Hope to see you in the fall! Mom, what are we doing here? You don't like it? This is for rich kids. Not if you get a scholarship. Ooh, I guess they gotta pay for Indiana Jones somehow. Why would they want me? Who wouldn't want you? You are smart, you have top percentile test scores. They give scholarships to people like you. Places like this open doors for the rest of your life. Did you ever get a scholarship? I went to public schools, but I was not as smart as you are. Hey, if you were here and you could study anything in the world, what would it be? Zoology? Zoology? I thought you liked English? That was last week. Don't be silly, you like English. Like, we gotta come in like you already know what you want to do. Like you're driven, okay? Alright. ♪ Hey. Morning. I-- That was my coffee. Whatever bodega sludge that was, this is better. You'll thank me later. Is there half-and-half? Mm. So, how was the school? We don't need to small talk, Patrick. You're being friendly. I'm establishing boundaries. What did you want to discuss? Okay, so, the consulting gig and the co-host thing are kind of a package deal. Then no, sorry. You said you wanted the gig. Sure, but I don't need it. What is so wrong with co-hosting? You are so off-brand for me! You mean your New Age yoga stuff? Listen, the last thing I need right now is something that's going to pull me away from my vlog, not to mention confuse my followers and muddle my brand. What if we tripled your fee? (laughing) Thanks for the coffee, Patrick. Okay, what if we connected you to advertisers? Promoted your vlog on the show and got you serious exposure? Why are you so desperate? (snorting) (sighing) They think my show needs a makeover. Yeah, it does. Listeners liked you, and management, for reasons that I cannot fathom, approved you. But do you want me? (scoffing) I don't have a choice. I wouldn't have time for the vlog. I will find you an intern. I will help you! Shoot, edit, find sponsors. Free labor! You'd have to allow me adequate time per week. Fine. And the show would have to align closer to my own brand. We'd have to agree on a guest list. Oh, come on. (groaning) This is my worst nightmare. Really? You should meditate on that. I'm going to help you, Patrick. For the record, this is not life coaching. This is just image consulting. Thanks for the coffee. It's good. It's perfect. (knocking) Was that you on The Patrick Dillon Show?! Please, come in. Uh, yes. What were you doing on his show? It's a side gig, but are you upset that I'm working? No, I am happy for you. But also how did you get that account? You know what? Never mind, more importantly the chemistry that was in the air, all of New York could hear it! There was no chemistry. - No? - No. It was tingling with electricity like Styrofoam stuck to a cat. He was doing his fake radio charm! I was trying to get a job. By flirting? Of course not, that's unprofessional. (laughing) Like, have you seen the man on the other end of that voice? Only on Page Six, but do tell. Why are you here? I am here to check in on you, and your life is obviously awesome, so... No, he may sound nice, but he is anything but. He is pretentious, he is pushy, he dresses like the landed gentry. But that deep voice. They add a filter! - No! - Yes! And he is the opposite of wellness! He's this mental gymnastics man. If you say so. They're mother-daughter journals. So cute. I rarely find time with Kim. That's what the park passports were for! You know, I'm actually doing a mother-daughter vlog episode on quality time together. My mom helped me make these prototypes. They're designed to promote wellness and foster creativity. It's basically a mindfulness journal for parents and a confidence builder for kids disguised as a productivity tool. You should use it with Kim. I can't, this is your prototype. No, I would love your feedback! I need testers. I really want to sell it through my vlog one day. I wish you told me about this while we were working together. I feel like I wasn't a good friend. No, I was worried that you'd think I wasn't 100% about the job, which I was, which was also the problem. Well, I'm glad that you're doing this, and I'm happy I get to be a better friend now. Yes, boss. Why is all the furniture weird? This is a big question mark. Oh, you can sit on it! Oh, it's uncomfortable. It's a statement piece. But where do you watch TV in your pajamas? My mom's picking her up soon. Look! Oh, that is a Lewis Braun. It's a play on Kazimir Malevich's Suprematism. I could totally paint it. She actually did paint that this morning. But this is brilliant! It questions representation itself. Who cares?! (chuckling) (laughing) It's been a while since I've been around kids. And maybe you could use some unfiltered honesty more often. (playing piano) Ooh. Careful, Fanny Mendelssohn. How about, let's try this. Here we go. (playing piano) (both laughing) I'm a puppet! (clearing throat) Are we going to work? Oh, jeez. The boss is back. Boo. (laughing) (playing jazz riff) So, the network has given us a couple weeks to find the new version of the show which will launch after the mid-season hiatus. Forwarding you the branding parameters. Just look over those now. Where's your phone? I'm doing a digital detox. I'm not using my phone for the day. Why? Wellness. It's a vlog episode I have coming up. Do you want me to print you out a hardcopy? Don't hurt the trees. (Ellie gasping) Look out there! Here, try these. Oh, they're heavy! That means they're expensive. Let me know when you find the United Nations building! You can't see it from here. It'll keep her busy. So I looked over the guest list. Impressive, right? Am I interrupting you? Continue. So, for the show, I was thinking-- Sorry. (scoffing) So, I was thinking for the sh-- Oh, sorry. Your guest list doesn't work for me. Your guest list doesn't work for me. Why not? I'm not going to undercut the sophistication of my show. I'm expanding it. With random mothers? Single-mom entrepreneurs. Who nobody's ever heard of! I'm sorry if they don't live in penthouses or act in movies, but I just would like to connect with normal people, like my vlog audience. Normal, huh? I can't find it. Keep looking! So, the re-branding proposals that I sent you. Those don't work for me. You're being stubborn. Look who's talking. Can I have my phone back please? Got a million things to do. - Okay. - Okay. Mom, this is Patrick. Patrick, this is my mother, Amy. I am a big fan. She isn't. Can I get a tour? My mom was just about to leave. I'm leaving. Mm. Can I ask for a favor? Be the voice on my answering machine. Hello, this is Patrick Dillon from Spreading the News, you've reached Amy Joy's phone, she's out living life and breaking hearts, Please leave a message and she will get back to you, cheers! Thank you so much! - You are the best! - Anytime. Anything else? Cocktail? Just be nice to him. Bye, babe. Bye. Thank you. Come on, Ellie. ♪ Hi, thank you for calling me back. Hi, I'm looking for waffle robe samples to review for my wellness vlog. Now, I don't have 30,000 followers yet. Minimum 30,000 followers? Well, I'm almost there. Do you work with influencers? I'm a single mother doing a vlog post on secrets of a good night's sleep, and I'll be on Spreading the News with Patrick Dillon soon. Okay, I understand. Thank you for your time. Yeah, I'd love to tell you more. Mom? Oh, sorry, mom's a little tired today. You didn't post today. I was busy with Patrick stuff, but I'll post tomorrow. What are we filming? We are journaling before bed. But you need me to hold the camera! I'll be fine. You can help tomorrow. Let's make some tea. Hi. Welcome back to Finding the Me Between the Beauty and the Mess, I'm Savannah Joy and in this video I'll be reviewing essential oils. (sighing) What am I doing? ♪ What do you wear on the weekend? What, you expect me to interview the titans of business in a tee shirt? You're not negotiating trade deals. Style is confidence. It says "I'm on your level." Are you saying that for them or for you? Let them feel powerful over you. They'll open up more. There's a reason why politicians take off their ties and roll up their sleeves, it sets the tone. I'm not talking at a Ford factory. We are doing a reverse Cinderella on you. You can still be classy but approachable. Add some jeans. Trust me. You look normal. Is that a compliment? Actually handsome. Actually? So much better without the tie. Much less uptight. Okay, show me how you sit. Your body language is closed. You're not watching the game on the couch. Do you know the people that I've interviewed? You've always been invisible on the air, but not to the person you're talking to. I get it, you've never been subject to scrutiny the way you might have been if you'd been on camera, but people react to this subconsciously. I'm behind a desk! I could be pantsless. I do interviews in a dark booth! I want to talk about that, too. Look, I do not have time to psychoanalyze my leg placement. This interview is in two hours. Maybe we just pick it up, figure it out on the fly? Yeah, okay. I've got stuff I have to do, too. Patrick: I find the Oscars more of a pageant for the masses to experience glamour rather than an award for the truly best anything. (clearing throat) I mean, when I was last there with my friend, Leo, I found the red carpet line so slow. I mean, they don't tell you how long it's going to be. So, Zoey. I love that Falafel Hut commercial you were in! My daughter laughs every time! You know, the one where you say, "I'm too full, I falafel." You know, you feel awful. You weren't in that commercial? Are you talking about Zoey Martin, the comedian? - I'm so sorry! - Oh... They don't even look alike! But maybe she had a wig on!? You know, movie magic! (clearing throat) I'm sorry. I'm new at this. I just quit my job and now I'm here all of a sudden, cohosting, you know? Fake it to you make it, right? Okay, Zoey is an Oscar winning actress, Savannah, and two Emmys, and extensive theater credits. You don't have to fake anything, you are an amazing actress! Although I'm sure you could fake whatever you want, if you had to! You know, the last time I conducted an interview was for my science camp magazine when I was 14, I was a little nerdy then, but, you know, who wasn't? And it was really good for college credits. and my mom was super into padding your resume, and I hope my college admissions people aren't listening, you know what I'm saying? You two are looking at me and this feels awkward! Is this awkward? Patrick! Get in there! Would you like to confess to anything else? I'm sorry, I was just trying to lower the stuffiness. Oh, you mean the elevated conversation? More like name dropping. Oh, please. Waxing poetic on the Oscars, maybe you could write a haiku about it. Try and join us up here, please. Oh, of course, Patrick. I forgot you're not a man. You're a radio god! Maybe we could talk about holistic candles instead, said no one ever. We have spent the last half hour pontificating about Hollywood rather than try to learn anything about her! We learned she doesn't do Falafel Hut commercials! I'm just trying to be real, Patrick, and I think your audience deserves that. - Okay, let's be real. - Okay. You didn't do the research, which is the first priority for any interviewer! I was busy and you didn't share your notes! Busy doing what? Huh? Doing what, Savannah? I was having an important puberty conversation with my daughter, okay? Yeah, I'm a single mom, self-employed. What did you do last night, Patrick, huh? Google yourself? Okay, you know you've done that too. Okay. I don't know. We're going to take a quick commercial break, and in the meantime, please check out Savannah's wellness vlog, Finding the Me Between the Beauty and the Mess. We'll be right back. Nice. (sighing) (door slamming) So, you two didn't compare notes? You didn't practice? I blame you for not coaching her better. Alisha-- You're not taking this seriously. Okay, it is obvious that this experiment isn't working. Let's go back to the old format. There is no going back, Patrick! We're not at number one anymore. To still be on the radio in this day and age with so much competition, you need broad appeal to justify the airwaves. She is your only hope and you're sabotaging it. And you! I expected better from you. I thought you never give up? We're going to air reruns this week, and then you two just figure this out. ♪ (sighing) I listened to the show today. I've been hired by a man who refuses to be helped. I thought the point of the show was to promote the vlog? I'm getting there. Or what if he does more harm than good for your brand? I know. You could quit. You know, I know you take pride in your work ethic. No, it's not that. I signed a contract. Oh. Look, I'm handling it. I can catch up on vlog episodes this week. Mm-hm. (sighing) I want to add a "Give Back" section. I think it would be a good mother-daughter activity. Mm. I agree. ♪ So, I see you know how to pick a spot. You ready to go? We gotta start working on the show. Sure, but as you can see, you have to work around my schedule now. No, you heard Alisha, the deadline is next week. We always spend Saturdays at the park, and I have my vlog work to do. We don't have time for park play. There's always time. No, there isn't. You just have to choose to make time. Yeah, that's cute on a T shirt, but that's not true. You promised, Patrick. That was part of the deal. (sighing) This is why I became a wellness entrepreneur. Self-care and family first. Wanna play? Yeah, why not. You do this every Saturday? Yup. What else do you guys do? Museums. Meditation. Creative day. Exploration Days. Like walking around a new neighborhood or trying a new restaurant. There isn't always time, but it is a matter of prioritizing. I decided that this was important to me. What's important to you? Uh, work. Yeah, but work for what end? It's just what I've always done. Are you happy? Yeah. That's what I said. You'd know for sure if you used one of these. You track what you're doing, your goals, and then can look back over a long period and see your state of mind, like where you spend your time, what's important to you. Your mom subject you to this torture? Yeah, but I like it. (laughing) So, we're going to do some work? Yes. You will record. Record what? Vlog episodes. We have four to shoot this week thanks to you. Come on, it'll be fun! - Ugh. Boring, boring boring. - Boring, boring, boring. Both: Boring, boring, boring, boring, boring, boring. Hey, okay! Okay! Wow. Wow, you two really lay it on thick with this peer pressure, hm? Okay.

Every month, mom makes me pick a job to learn about. This month it's architect. You have a favorite building? I dunno. Have you looked at different building styles? Okay, well, let me show you. Over here, see, this church is built in the Gothic style. And you can tell that the architect was inspired by that when they built these big arches. I-- I love this style. It's just big, fun. All different kinds of buildings around. It's easy to find your favorite. And over there, that's called Art Deco. I don't know how you do it, working for 80 hours a week for no pay, on call 24 hours a day, and yet thriving. Being a mother. Toughest job there is. I get paid in happiness. Seeing her. It isn't always easy. Started out in complete chaos. Oh, yeah? I suddenly found myself a single mother and ill-equipped. My wellness vlog was a matter of self-preservation at first. I was just looking for tips on how to survive from other single mothers, but when I witnessed the support from others, it became my obsession. Not only was I helping myself, but I was helping others. People like me juggling family and professional life just want to know the how. How people who have made it have figured it out. How they thrive amidst the drama. I mean, that's interesting to every New Yorker I think. I built a successful show for years because I gave people a window into a world they can't access. The elite? Yeah, people don't want to see movies about normal people. They want escape! They want inspirational entertainment. Normal people can inspire. Yeah, I mean, I see where you're coming from. My parents, they came from modest backgrounds. But they don't listen to my show anymore. I had fun today, thank you. See, slowing down helps. For a day. (gasping) You should try journaling. Well, It's been a nice waste of time. Well, I'm glad I could be your life coach for the day. And thank you for holding up your end of the bargain and helping today. And I will have a list of advertiser contacts for you. Ellie. You're leaving?! (imitating explosion) Sadly. This is Barts. I think you mean beaux-arts? It's beautiful. (chuckling) What do I put here? Your essay. It says, "Who do you admire?" Do you know who you're going to write about? No. Well, you seemed to like Amelia Earhart when we researched her. I guess. Who do you think I should write about? Oh, that's up to you. I can't help you with this. Parents are not allowed. I need to think about it. This is a lot. Is Patrick helping with more vlog episodes? Well, somebody has go to hold the camera if you're not. I can let him. ♪ Hi. You ready? I got you something. You know the way to a girl's heart. I talked to the station's tech guy. So, you could up your vlog game. All the influencers are using proper lights these days. I know, I was planning to upgrade. Well, the station was just going to get rid of this stuff, so it's yours. - Patrick, I can't accept that. - Oh, that's a gift from me. You didn't have to buy me one! I didn't. I actually got a new one, this is my old camera. It was kind of awkward shooting on your phone yesterday, I almost accidently chucked it into the pond. Thank you. Well, this is really just a ruse to help you shoot faster so you can spend more time working on the show. (chuckling) Always an agenda. Let's go. You need to practice with normal New Yorkers. Not just people concerned with the latest collaboration. What are we doing here? I'm going to give you a challenge. Make a person smile. Easy. I can make anyone laugh. No, the goal isn't to tell a joke. It's to charm and connect on a real level. Look, you're out of your booth, you're vulnerable, and you gotta be vulnerable to connect. Show me what you got. Excuse me, sir? Can I talk to you a-- Uh, hi, could I just talk to you for a minute? I just want to ask you a quick question! (chuckling) Excuse me. I just wanted to ask you a question. A poll with my friend here. Do you collect anything? Pincushions. I know it makes me sound like an old lady. What about them do you like? I dunno, my Aunt I love collects them and they're so silly cute. Do you have a favorite? A porcupine one. I love it when people are passionate about stuff, you know? No matter how small. I even have an Instagram page for them, Sew Happy. I will give that a follow. Thank you for talking to me. Patrick Dillon not waxing poetic about trendy things! That was fast. Yeah, I just asked her about something I know she'd love. Easy smile. Ah, so you got them to talk about something genuine? Yeah, yeah, you made your point. I'm just trying to get you to flex old muscle memory. Also, don't cross your arms so much. Wait a second, are you actually listening to me? You know what? You should join me. Yes, you. You could use the practice. I dare you to get someone to tell you a deeply personal story. Get them to cry. - (laughing) - Oh! Come on. - Team effort. - (chuckling) She followed me everywhere. We were inseparable. We had such fun times. But there was another side? Hurtful? I understand. A lot of these relationships, they have such extreme highs and lows, and the lows can be brutal. She would scratch me and torment me. When I left I felt... Relieved? But were you happy? No. She was a good cat, a real affectionate kitten, but growing up on the farm, alone, the only kid for miles-- She was your only friend. Yeah. (sniffling) A pleasure talking to you folks. - Mm. - (sighing) Well, that was the most intense conversation about a cat. You were connecting, right? (laughing) Wow. (chuckling) Thank you. Did you always want to work in radio? Mm! Oh, God. (both laughing) No, I used to be a serious print journalist. Yeah, The Times. Really? Mm-hm. I did profiles. I was fascinated by people. Then one day, I'm doing a profile on a DJ, W-A-G-E, and the producer invites me to do an interview on air. Well, it turns out I have a talent for disarming guests. - (chuckling) - New York loved it. Now, how did you go from that to interviewing socialites? Well, you know, I was good at asking hard questions to the rich and powerful because of my profiles. They didn't scare me. So the station asked me to dive deeper into that, and I did. In every which way, including my life. Which was good for promoting my brand, and networking with guests. Makes sense. Yeah, but... Eventually it became me. Started dating a stylist. Started playing the role. When my ex-fiancée left me, the show was the only thing I had, on the air and off. I'm sorry. Oh, it wasn't meant to be. It was for the better, believe me. You know, I used to have real conversations with guests. I did, and then the station wanted me to have this elitist slant. Which, now, apparently, they want me to shed. Yeah. What about you? Happy with the way you see yourself now? I've felt stuck the last couple years. My vlog and my journal both stalled, but shooting the other day, it feels like I finally have momentum, and it feels amazing. We are going to promote that on the show! Thank you. I should go. - (laughing) - Yeah. Yeah. Me, too. Yeah, Ellie is probably tired of my mom. Yeah. I have a phone. Emails. Emails. Right, right. (laughing) Business stuff. - Okay. Thank you for-- - Okay, thank you. - Oh, yeah. - These are amazing. - Okay. - Uh. Yeah. (sighing) Him? I rarely do penthouse renovations under eight figures. Billionaires don't want something someone else has. They want the impossible. But how do you work with clients who don't understand compromise? Well, first of all, we don't use that "C" word. Okay, but what do you say to someone who is always used to getting their way? Look, this is the art of dreams and if they pay, I do. - Okay, but I don't-- - But are there any-- - I was just-- - I mean, if you're just-- I'm sorry, you go ahead. No, no. Please, please. Go ahead. - (Patrick chuckling) - Sarah: Are you s-- You guys are adorable. - (both stammering) - Just kidding, just kidding. (both laughing) What was that?! It was so slow I wanted to pulled the fire alarm! Why was that so awkward like two teenagers? Are you two hooking up? - Definitely not! - No! Definitely not. No. So, then what's the angle? What's the show, Patrick? We haven't figured it out yet. So, I have no proposed branding from you yet, no act structure, no guest list. You two can't work like an interviewing team unless you have tone and format. Now, you know this! What's the issue? This is my fault. I was slowing us down, but we're on the same page now. Can you-- Can you just give us a little bit more time, please? Nail the rebrand by next week for the start of the second half of the season or be cancelled. That's a bit harsh. It's not my call. There are plenty up and coming podcasters with millions of followers already that the 10th floor would love to take a chance on. Is she always like that? Don't you have an episode you need to edit and post? No, we're going to figure this out first. Maybe we should do what I always do when I'm stuck. Take a break. Right, the opposite of work. No, mindfulness will lead to inspiration. Okay. What's the plan, then? - (sighing) - Yeah. Come on. ♪ Ugh. I love this city. Me, too. There's a patina of frustration from living on top of each other that covers this entire city, but if you scratch that off, there is a beautiful story around each corner. Look who's being a poet. It's how I feel. You don't get that hiding away in a loft. No. You definitely don't. Maybe we need to push the corny poet in you to find the angle? How about you show me your New York? Well... Mindfulness leads to real change? You stole that from my post! Are you stalking me? No, I've been journaling. Come on. Got a surprise for you tomorrow. ♪ So, as promised, I found you a potential sponsor for your vlog. Who is it? The world's largest online wellness retailer, Boutique Thrive. I don't trust them, sustainability or ingredient-wise. Okay, you can ask them about it. Do you know they sell glitter infused face masks! Microplastics pollute the water and they harm your skin. It's all just for social media photos! Okay, no glitter. What's wrong? Look, I should have told you, but I'm a few days into a juice cleanse detox for the vlog. You had to pick a lunch meeting! How was I supposed to know? Just don't eat anything. Do you know how hard that is? Just-- Just chat with her, and try to be your normal charming self. Yeah. Okay. I'm just a little bit hangry. If she wants to talk glitter masks, we're going to talk about glitter masks. I am not discussing glitter masks. Hi. We love working with influencers. Have you seen our new mud glitter masks? Your followers will love them! I don't recommend anything to my followers that I don't believe in. They trust me. Oh, no, no. Of course not! No, no, no, no. All we're asking is that you review our masks and recommend the best. It's not an endorsement. Do you test on animals? No. What about your lack of sustainability in aloe production? I'm sure whatever report is watered down. Thank you so much for talking with us, Charlotte! (scoffing) Well. Thanks, Charlotte. I'm sorry. I want to promote things that people need, not push products. Especially products that I don't care about. You know you could grow your audience with Boutique Thrive. You could do whatever you want, your own products, collaborations, no one will remember glitter masks! I am not sacrificing my principles just to make it. It's not that bad. Look, they may not be perfect, but I have a list of sponsors who will pay you well enough that you can ditch the image consulting and focus full-time on your vlog! I need to do this my way, Patrick. Even if it takes years? If that? (clearing throat) What? (groaning) Bread is so good. Let's order you some food and then let me go over the analytics that the advertisers care about. You little gluten devil. That's where the older kids played stickball. By the time I was old enough, no one played. And there... ...is my window. Parents moved to Denver, but I still know people in the neighborhood. You don't come around much, do you? No. You have a better view these days. Yeah, but less heart. I used to hang out at my dad's bookshop, chatting with customers. Talked to a lot of strangers as a kid. My parents, they never cared about the latest fashion collaboration or a new restaurant opening. Didn't matter how you dressed as long as you wore pants. Looks like you made them proud. Yeah, maybe. I know what we should do. ♪ (exhaling) Alright, come on, Patty. We ain't got all day! You can't rush perfection. Oh, yeah? Pat. (blowing raspberry) (both laughing) (laughing) - Hey! - Whoa! Uh... You're out. - You didn't tag me. - What?! (cheering) Remember the first thing I asked you? How do you see yourself? Somewhere between here and Manhattan. Guess I didn't go far. But you went high. Where do you see yourself? Still finding the me between the beauty and the mess. All I know is I found my passion when I was just trying to make my everyday life work. What if that's it? What do you mean? Don't focus on how guests made it or what got them to where they are, but instead on personal root memories, their upbringing, what made them people to begin with? Like us here today. and then we'll understand their passion and how they manage to make their everyday lives work amidst the chaos of what they do. Maybe a requirement is that they bring a family member or a friend? Someone who knows them well. I mean, that would be a different dynamic than an interview normally has. We could even interview them live in their own home? Or place of work. We can do that, right? Why not? Our guest list could be elite self-made people. We could have single mom entrepreneurs on there, too. I think we've got some work to do. And plenty of vlog episodes to shoot. - Of course. Of course. - Of course. I mean, the gymnast maybe. but the other one I don't think would be kind of radio quality. ♪ Oh, gotta get to you now We need one of these. You don't like mine? No. That's a bit harsh. I believe the term is "unfiltered honesty." ♪ You might be Heaven Do you like mushrooms? Uh... You had them last time. ♪ Ah, ooh Let's see. (groaning) Mm-hm. Oh, this is nice. (both laughing) Everybody keeps saying that Graeme Campbell is available. No, I-- Yes, yes. We are definitely aiming higher than Graeme Campbell. (gasping) Southern Bordeaux wine. Actually the minerality of this dish is what really ties it in. I would keep my eyes on him. Fresh salad... I might be relaxing on this couch. Clearly. I think you can sit up properly. This is quite fun. ♪ Ah, ooh - To the chefs. - To the chefs. - Cheers. - Cheers. ♪ Oh, you might be Heaven I learned it from the best. Mm! (laughing) (speaking indistinctly) Well, thank you for letting me be part of the team. Well, I needed someone to hold the camera. (chuckling) I imagine you're itching to get back to your routine? What do you mean? You know, gallery shows and celebrity hangouts. Uh, not really. I mean, don't need to move if I'm having fun here. Ellie: Mom, are we journaling? Of course! Um, do you want to join us? Yeah, let me just finish up here. How's it going with Patrick? It's going. Quite the 180, huh? He's been helpful with the vlog. I've been posting on schedule. I even have some advertising contacts to pursue, but... But? This all sounds great! I think we're finally nailing the show's angle. I think it'll be phenomenal. But where does that leave me? What do you mean? I've got my own brand I need to focus on! I took this job because I needed the momentum from him, but once I get it I can't get sucked into a show that's going to pull me away from my own dream. Plus, I'm worried that Ellie is becoming too attached. I think you should follow your heart. Are you giving me mindfulness advice? I have just been using the journals with Kim and it's been eye-opening to say the least. Been doing some reflection, making some changes. Like what? Dinner. Okay, I know it seems small, but sitting down to a good homemade meal every night with Kim, not rushed, it's been wonderful. That's amazing. I think I didn't want to track my emotions, because I was afraid of the truth. I mean, you can't deny it on paper. "Rushed" was my theme. Keep going. Will do, coach. There is one other thing. The partners wanted me to make you a counteroffer to bring you back full time. Double what you made before. That's more than I've ever made. As your friend, I-- I think you should stick to your vlog. That's a big number to walk away from. Think about it. You don't have to give them an answer 'til next week. (sighing) Where are we? We are in the kitchen. So, why don't we interview a Michelin chef's family? - I love it. - Yeah? Yeah. Oh, that's great. Um, we could-- (phone ringing) Hello? Hi, Miss Callaghan! (mouthing "She got in") The scholarship interviews are when? Okay. Thank you so much. This is wonderful news! What's wrong? She got in, but still has the scholarship interview. Tuition is like the price of a new car every semester. And she'll get the scholarship. Yeah, but what if she doesn't? I mean, I have money saved for the vlog, but maybe I can't waste it on that? You have to follow your dreams. Even if she gets it this year, she has to reapply every year. Yeah but if the show is renewed, you'll have additional income. I can't depend on that. Then you figure it out. I don't have that luxury. Ellie comes first. I think you can do both. Mom! I should go tell her. Okay! (laughing) I just want you to be as professional as possible and check all the boxes that the school is looking for, okay? What's wrong? I dunno, I just want to be myself. Yeah, but you gotta be more than that, too. Is Patrick helping us shoot tomorrow? Oh, no. He isn't. Oh. Ellie, he's not going to be around all the time. Maybe not at all. He's got his own life. We need to focus on us. The team. Okay? That's my girl. Okay, sit up. Shoulders back, hands on your lap. Okay. (clearing throat) So, Ellie, what are your interests? English. (repeating) English. I like English the best. Nice. Okay. (clearing throat) So, Ellie, what are you reading right now? I just finished a book called Believe Me. And what do you like about Believe Me? I would probably say the character development. It was written very nicely. Yes, girl! You're going to ace this. So, what sacrifices have you had to make to get here? It had to be a dream we both wanted. It's not just me alone in the kitchen getting Michelin stars. Patrick: My parents were the same. My dad had a bookstore, it was his dream, but he was not a good businessman. So, it would have died many times if my mother didn't believe in it, too. When you first opened and got that scathing review, what did you do? My instinct was to work harder, but I was forcing it. Hm. So, how did you find your voice? Our daughter. Uh... The whole flavor of the restaurant came from... Me wanting to show her our family's heritage. Wow. I love that. Well, thank you so much for coming on today. This has been Spreading the News with Patrick Dillon... And Savannah Joy. 'Til tomorrow. That was great, guys! And doing interviews live on location every weekday morning will be a grind, but the results are clear. I mean, these familiar spaces really bring out the intimacy. And you can feel it too in the sound of the room, and then you guys were absolutely in sync, too! Well, we have some guests we want to run by you for approval. It's going to be a logistical nightmare, but we're ready. We should also do supplementary content for the website. I agree. I hope you two can pull this off. Talk soon. (exhaling) What's up? I'm just happy everything's coming together. I know. Hey, there'll be time for the vlog, I promise. I'll help. Alisha: Patrick? I can't get out of this gallery opening, would you want to come with me? A gallery opening? Yeah. I'll send you the information in case you want to come. Alisha: Patrick! (both chuckling) I'd be honored if you would be my plus one. Miss Callaghan: What's your favorite subject? I like English the best. Do you have any other interests? Don't worry about your mom. We'll come back to that. I read your essay about who you admire. We studied Amelia Earhart recently. Wonderful, but Ellie wrote about someone else. You. "I admire my mom because she follows her heart. She inspires other people to take care of themselves, just like she takes care of me. My mom says that following your dreams is the scariest thing of all, but I want to be like her and follow my heart, but I'm new and she's not, so I have to find out what that is for me. That's why we learn about new jobs and topics every month." So, Ellie. What does your heart want to do? I guess I do like something the most. What's that? I've always wanted to be a veterinarian. Wonderful. Why? Doctors help people, but animals need help, too. They have personalities. Miss Callaghan: They do. My friend, Suzie, has two cats, they're very different. Did you know that you need to study chemistry and biology to become a veterinarian? Yes. Grandma says chemistry is like cooking except you can't eat the ingredients. So, why didn't you put veterinarian on your application? Why didn't you tell me that you wanted to be a veterinarian? I did, but you never listened. Whenever I talked about animals you said we couldn't get a pet. How did I do? You did great. You did. Sorry I didn't listen more. It's okay, mom. ♪ Patrick Dillon. Hey, man! Congratulations, man.

I just worked like every day was my last. Really? Yeah, man, at this point I have no time for anything but than pursuing perfection. You know, you gotta be like-- like a seagull over the Arctic ocean, just never landing, never resting until you catch that fish, you feel me? - Mm. - Just no distractions. But hey, I'm preaching to the choir, right? So. Well... So, what, no hot date? Uh... You found someone? Oh, my God. That is so unlike you! How are you going to have time for the show now then? Sorry, man. I gotta-- I gotta go mingle. Hey. You do you. Seagull, baby. Don't forget. - Seagull. - (chuckling) ♪ Hi! Oh, great seeing you, too. Uh, yeah, well the show is a bit different, but I'm glad to hear you like it. Oh, yeah. Well... Of course. Patrick: Honestly, it's Savannah, not me. She really set the bar high. Thank you so much for listening. ♪ She's gonna get the scholarship. I got an offer to go back to my old job for double what I made. Are you seriously considering it? We wouldn't be at the mercy of the scholarship this year or next. What about our show? Your show. I thought you wanted this too. I want you to succeed. This show is going to be phenomenal! I know. You complement me. I want more than that. I have dreamed for years of doing something meaningful like this. That's not my dream. Which you're just going to walk away from for this job?

So you're just going to walk away from your passion because it's not exactly the way you want it? I can still work it on the side. How did that work out last time? I got you to a good place. You're seriously quitting? This is spiraling into too much commitment for me, my contract says that I-- Seriously? I don't care about the contract. I care about you following through on your passion. I mean, you practically kicked mindfulness into my head and now you are completely avoiding it. That's why I'm leaving this show! I'm sorry this is hurtful for you. Fine, leave me, but don't leave me for a job that you don't care about! That is hurtful. If not now for the vlog, then when? Huh? (scoffing) You make these promises to yourself, but don't really change. What about you? What about me? You've slowed down for a second, but you don't know where you're going! You haven't made any meaningful changes in your own life, you're on the same path to burnout or sell out. This is what I want. What do you want? I'm happy for you. You've clearly regained your mojo, but I have my own life and it's none of your business. So, we've booked half the guests-- Savannah quit. What? Why? Follow through issues. I can maintain the new format without her. I promise. Guest list is set. We've recorded her questions in advance. The research is done, I just-- I just need to stay grounded without her. I'm committed. Fine, go for it. It's your funeral. ♪ Where's Patrick? I quit. It was becoming too much. You were right. I have to focus on my vlog. But he was helping you.

Well, all I know is that you and Ellie have been happy for the past few weeks. Read your journal if you don't believe me. You know, Clara offered me my old job back at double my salary. Ellie's tuition wouldn't be an issue. You are indeed good at this wellness thing and you have to do it because it's who you are! Jenny's daughter came up to me the other day, raving about how your vlog helped her and her friends. She was talking about you like you were a saint, and I know you ain't no saint.
