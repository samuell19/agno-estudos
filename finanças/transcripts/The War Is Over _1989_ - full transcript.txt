After the War Hey. Be careful. You can't stay here. You will get killed. Just close the door! We can't wait for the brats forever. We need to practise the salute for the Americans. He is always disappearing, when he is needed. They will get to know me... I didn't catch him. Ready? Set! We will practise without drum and trumpet. Ready? Set. Go! That has worked fine. The didn't see us. Yeah! To make a flag out of these rags. That's so typical, Josyane. Don't you think that Mama won't notice her rouge being used by you and H?l?ne. Maybe. But you should keep quiet anyway. I won't say anything. Don't you think that the Americans will notice Michelle's girls? Rascal! Your stamp is too big for all the stars. Why? How many are there? I don't know. A lot. Hi. How do you like my dress? Is the girl pretty? Very very beautiful! H?l?ne? Do you know how many stars are on the american flag? What? - How many stars are on the flag? Many. As many as the soldiers that will march on the high street. All of them good looking. Why don't you ask Papa. As mayor he ought to know. - Okay. Go on! ... and so we are telling your victorious armies that we are free now! Papa? - What's up? How many stars are on the american flag? Let's see! There is one star for each state, alright?! And every star is a symbol. And how many are there? - 48, my dear. Is that right? If Mama says so, yes! There are 48 stars on the american flag. Thank you Mama. And? Here we won't miss them. - We will be the first to see them coming. We will be thrown out of the band anyway. So what? In two weeks we are gone. You maybe, but what about me? I have to help Dad in the butcher shop. If the war is over, I will return to my Mum in Lyon. And when I am older I will join the circus in Paris. As a clown? No, you twit. As a freedom fighter with a slingshot! Do you hear that? They're here. Finally. Yeah! Hurray! There they are! Let's go! Hold my trumpet, will you. You left your drum. - So what! They're here. The Americans are here. What are they doing there? You shitty pants. Just wait! YOU LITTLE PIGS! That is our job! Bastards! What's up? - You just heard it. You can come down now. The Americans are here! With a lot of tanks! We have seen them! They're here! Finally! Hurray! They're here, finally. - The Americans are here. Look who's here! Can we prevent you from telling rubbish? Let him finish. - What are you saying? What did you see? The Americans! We saw their tanks! And where did you see them? - On the hill. We saw them first, even before Robert and his troop. Is that right, Gaby? Yes, Papa. I swear! My God! That's some news! Let's go, so that we won't miss them. Finally they're here. I'll tell Dad now. - Oh No! Have you seen them? Shit! Papa, they're here! - Mama, can we go there? That too. Look at this. I am begging you, just stitch any bottom to the trousers. And hurry. Just relax. Your Americans won't just march past. Attention! Just repeat after me: Welcome to Americans! It's ok, Mr. LeBlau. Please give us some space. Get into position, gentlemen. Please. The small ones to the front. And you? Where is your drum? How many tanks were there? We didn't count them, but it was a long convoy. And the mayor? What is your father doing? My dad is coming soon. That's near Robert's barn. What is this? - Calibre 75. They won't shoot at us, won't they? - In any case, this is a 75er. Are you sure, you saw the Americans? We did see tanks. DAMN! That's the Germans! GO ON! HIDE! DAMN IT! Put your hat on. And follow me quickly. Andr?! Damn! - Hey. Wait for me. Andr?... PAPA! Please look at me! My god! They did kill him! HELP US! HELP US! HELP US! These urchins are the devil's own. Doesn't surprise me. With this origin! That's enough. Without their bikes, they can't be far. Far or not, if I catch them I make them remember the "Americans"! I will punish them for their pranks! But Victor, it was not deliberate. You can't be sure about that. We will find out. Didn't you find your son yet, Paul? - Not yet. But punishment awaits him. I am telling you two... that it would be better for everybody involved, if this wasn't done deliberately. This is more severe than stealing melons from the widow Perault. It's you, who are responsible. Responsibility. Bah! These two are my nephews, not my sons. To shelter them here, was bad enough. I have been feeding them for three years now. And why? Only to give their mother the opportunity to have sex with the Germans in Lyon. Fantastic. No more money for them, I swear! Nevertheless she is sending money. I think they persuaded Gaby. It won't possible otherwise. Your offspring is valued higher than the others Mr. Butcher? That's not what I wanted to say. If they did it deliberately, I will send Gaby straight into a priest seminar. But I don't think that my boy has enough imagination for something like this. That's my opinion. Do you have the urchins' IDs? Madeleine, give it to him. Maybe they want to return to their mother... If we haven't found them by tomorrow, I can contact Lyon to assist with the search. Why don't you do it now? If you catch them, I won't pay for "holidays" in the priest seminar. Put them into reformatory, right now. You can have my written confirmation here and now. Victor! What Victor?! Shall we crown them, instead? Antoine Adrian Morant, son of Elaine Adelaide Toulise and Jean Morant, just write this down. And then Julien Claude Toulise... ... not by the same name? Antoine is from Elaine's first marriage. A nice marriage! The father left for the Isle de Rey, when the baby was barely six months old. The mother got divorced. I'd rather not know, where the second boy is from. There was no "buyer" for him. Father unknown, as stated there. He goes by her maiden name. He goes by her prostitute's name, so that the whole region can laugh about it. He is a worthless prostitute's son. That's my view. That is your view, because of this we have a dead mayor on our hands. And? I didn't force him to run into the street with the flag. Now you are talking rubbish. No, I am not talking rubbish. Nobody forced him. No, you drank too much. And? Hop on. The police are in the house. We should disappear. They think we did it deliberately. But it wasn't our fault. We didn't kill the mayor. Just tell them that! Where are we going now? How about Lyon to see Mum? - That's far away. So what? It's not you, who has to pedal. Shut up! Antoine, please stop. My feet are killing me. Why? We are resting all the time. It has been less than 10 kilometres. Take your brother instead of me. Then you will see. I am stopping now. Julien, get off. Where are we? - At a nice place to pee. Your father is wrong. Sometimes you have good ideas. Is it okay with your mum, if I come along? Don't worry about that. We just have to be aware of the police. Even if it isn't, I don't care. I know now where my dad is. Is that right? - And where is he? On the Isle de Rey. But it's my dad who's there, not yours, Julien. What's up? - Might be the police. Crouch down! Look at them. They are really beaten. No wonder. The British and Americans beat them heavily. It's still a lot. And? The Americans are at least one million. The British and De Gaulle on top of that. With all of them Hitler is kaput. Why didn't they come earlier? - Because of bad weather. You. There are bikes. - Yes. Shit. Shit, they saw the police bikes. Just our luck. Shitheads. These damned soldier pigs. Stop! The cow. It wants to eat me. Shit. We fell asleep. Are you crazy to make such a racket? You did frighten me. Such a loony. Easy for you to say, the cow had it's tongue all over me. Only to lick your head as it would do with a calf. Julien, as it knows you already, could you ask it for some milk? I would like to have breakfast now. No, I am not dumb. It will only kick me. I know how this is done. It's so easy. But where shall we put it? We need to find something. Stop. It's too full already. We need to hurry, the cap won't hold it. Hurry up with the milk. Who goes first? - You! It's your cap. Haha. I bet there are lice in it. Idiot. You would see them floating, if I had any. Fresh milk from a cow. That's superb. It's even warm. Only sugar is missing. With a bit of red wine, it would have been even better. Look, down there. A farm. And? What about it? Maybe we could get something. We creep up from behind. Julien, you stand guard here. Why is it always me? Because you need to pick blackberries for dessert. So you think. If I find any, I will eat them myself. Wow. Direct hit. - Maybe we can find some eggs, too. There are two. - Just look, what I've found. What are you two doing there? Are you just stealing my eggs? Bastards! This is outrageous! Stay here! We wanted to buy them, monsieur. I swear. Two dozen and even a chicken, you rascal. You will pay for them, you or your father. Come on, get a move. Shithead. Not my father, monsieur. I don't want to join the priest seminar. I am not interested. Get a move on. Julien! Where is the jerk? Answer me! Shit. Hey, Julien! Over here. - Ah there. Come here, Julien. - Not too many blackberries here. We have to get away from here right now. Come and I'll tell you why. Ok, but where is Gaby? - He got caught, the farmer has noticed us. Start running, you duck. Great that you found food, as there were not many blackberries. I feel sorry for Gaby. He only needed to run away as well. Instead he stood there like a lemon. But now each of us has one egg. Gaby can't keep his mouth shut. I know him too well. He will tell everything. Just to avoid joining the priest seminar. And soon they will... chase us. Who will chase us? The police, you dummy. If we're really lucky, Victor. And in my band uniform, I will be easy to spot. Here. Did you see how it works? It's easy. You just have to suck hard. Yuck! That's disgusting! You gourmet. You didn't object to the blackberries. Your tongue is black. So, let's move. I'm sure they're looking for us. - Impossible, why should they know anything? What do you think? The police have a telephone. They did call everywhere, even Lyon. - You think so? Most likely. I know this area. I was here once with Victor fixing something. If you want to cross the river, there is nothing but this bridge. How shall we do this then? - I have no idea. Come on, let's hide. In two minutes they will get past here. They are still fighting near Barnaud. Last night they bombed the station in Lyon to prevent their withdrawal. I really think this is the end. Good. 4 years of occupation is enough. I've got it. Look there. Let's disguise ourselves. I am going there alone. And you stay here. Now I've got enough. Why is it always me? Stop arguing. I am the boss. Meanwhile you can pick pears. But don't eat them. You better be quiet. If you're laughing at me, then you have to carry on without me. Give me a hand instead of eating grapes! They are looking for boys. We have tricked them. What about me? What shall I wear? You only have to get rid of the jacket. I can't, because of the pockets. - What's with the pockets? Here, they're full. - So what. Put it into the basket. And hurry, idiot. Antoine, there is a dog! I know it. It won't bite. You're sure about that? Listen dog. Leave my hat alone. And? What impression does it give? - One could say almost a real girl. Hey! Are you crazy? Maybe it likes girls. - You better watch your cheeky mouth. Stop it! Get a move on. We have to go. Antoine, it's still there. - It doesn't matter. Leave it. Give me your hand. Hey boys, look who's coming. - Oh, a lass. Good day lass. - Where are you from? We don't know you. What's your name, lass? - Leave my sister alone! Oh, and he. He is a bed-wetter. - You're one. Shut your trap, mama's boy. We like your sister. - Are you gonna show us? She broke his nose. - Such a nasty one. Stay there, or the dog will go after you lot. Get lost, you cow. - Your knickers must be smelly you pussy. You just got lucky with the dog. Don't show your face here again. Come on, let's move fast. What do you want Madame Leraux? I need ... some chicory. Mama, I just saw my dress. - Why? What's with your dress? There is a girl with my dress just walking across the square. What are you saying? I'm sure that's gypsies. - You're right. Hey you! You gypsy girl! JUST WAIT! Where did you steal the dress that you are wearing? Shit! You damned little thief! ROGER! Stop her. She stole my laundry. Let's go and catch them. Come on, help us. Come on, you sleepy head. Help us, stop her. We are getting her. Stop her. That's a dead end. You're not getting any further, you pigs. Julien, jump into the boat. It will bite you, if you come closer. Roger, don't you get frightened by the dog! - And if it has rabies? Get out of the way! Hurry up, Antoine. Dog. Come here. Jump. Yes. You pigs won't go far. - Thieves! You fools! You idiots! - You just wait. We will tell the police. What are you waiting for? Get there and stop shouting. You should have watched your laundry instead of going to the shop. Just look at them arguing. Am I wasting my time in the Caf?? And you, stop crying. This won't bring your dress back. We were lucky. Without the dog they would have caught us. Did you see it jumping? Unbelievable. Don't move. Give me another one. There is the girl again! That's my father's boat. They've got nerves. - Find things to throw at them. Attack! Antoine, they are targeting us. That's their bait. It's the boys from before. Be careful when we get to the other side of the bridge. You stupid cow! - We will show you! I will beat you up! - Thieves! - Whore! When they catch you, you will go to the reformatory! Drown! You cowards up there are shitheads! Look at this, you idiot. They threw their fish down. Hey! Many thanks for the fish! I don't believe it! Are you stupid? Throwing our fish down. Such a dummy. Here. Now you have something to throw. Free delivery. Isn't it great? I like it. But I am soaked. You are well off. Stop moaning. You will be dry very soon. Isn't it great? Fish, roast chicken, dessert. Just like a restaurant. We need to find something to cook it. I won't eat it raw. Don't worry. I know how red Indians cook. You will see, it's easy. You're crazy. A dog can't have pears. Ok. Let's see if it likes this. Tex? How do you know its name? I don't! I made it up... All German shepherds are called Tex. That's common knowledge, right Tex? Let's go to the mill. - Why? To light a cooking fire. - How do we light a fire? I read it in Gaby's book. The smoke won't get noticed if we light the fire in the mill. That's another red Indian trick. And what will they do without a mill to hide the smoke? Then they go into caves, jerk. Just look how great it is. - Yes, but I am also afraid. Do you think Gaby has joined the priest seminar by now? If his dad said so, I am sure he did. Great! Let's see if it is still working. If we want, we could make pear mash. Or fish meal. But it might be disgusting. And the bread will taste like fish. You're not making bread with this, jerk. Stop calling me jerk. You're a jerk. Hey, look there. Yeah. The Americans! RAISE YOUR ARMS, YOU TWO! Go on! Shit. That's a German. Get down from there! NOW! Don't try to escape, or I have to kill you! Get over here! I am warning you, we're not alone! You think you're clever? I don't believe you. Come over here. TEX! Come here, Tex! I told you that we are not alone. Leave us alone, otherwise the dog will go after you! And it will eat you raw. Just like the other Germans. Some maybe... but not one in uniform. Come to me. Sit! That's a good dog. Is this your dog? - Not really. And as you can see: German soldier and German dog. We do what we are told. Now that you are on your own, raise your arms above your head. Come over here! Doesn't matter. The Americans will be here soon. You Germans have lost. I know this myself, jerk! That's the reason why I need you. You two will help me. Help with what? To get out of this rat-hole. And you girl, now you will return to your village! What's so funny about this? - Nothing! He is just stupid. No! Only because you said girl. So what? This is my brother. There, you see how daft he is. He thinks it's funny that I am disguised as a girl. Enough of this! If I am not a girl, then I know who isn't my brother. Shut your mouth! You shut your mouth! You are not my brother, if you want to know. Yes, I am your brother! Stop lying! Enough of that! Shut up! Damn it! I have not been lying in the dirt for two days and waiting for two brats like you two! Come here you! You will be my hostage. And you, girl or boy, will get a doctor down here without drawing attention. Do I make myself clear? Yes! But what shall I tell the doctor? I don't know. Make something up. Don't even try to set me up and bring the resistance along. Otherwise your little brother will... And what if the doctor doesn't want to come? - Then he will kill me, don't you see? Exactly! Here! Show it to him, but don't hand it over. Try to buy some food and red wine, so I will get back to shape. Start running and hurry. Otherwise I will die from the pain. What's the dog for? - It followed us and then we kept it. Then I am really... in your debt. How do you mean? - Nothing. Damn, it's painful! Are you in pain? - What? Some pain. Damn shit! It's just happening at the worst moment. Help me to get up. Damn. That's the only thing what eases the pain. But I won't manage on my own. Did you got shot in the bum? It couldn't be worse than this. Get the basket for me to see what's inside. There's nothing in it. Only angling gear. Don't be stupid and get the basket. My gun obeys me like the dog! So that's angling gear? I really should leave him alone with the German. That will show him. The pears smell like fish. It doesn't matter. Something to bite and I feel better. They are for Antoine and myself to share. I am sure you have already eaten your share. No! How many did you eat, boy? - Only a few. Here. But I don't believe it. It also likes pears. Just give it one. That's for the dog. It's a bit like me. A very special German. Why aren't you a normal German? Are you sitting on the cap of a railway station supervisor? How come you can speak our language? So you are surprised about that? Because I am French like you. Almost. It's impossible to be French when you are German. Quite the opposite. There are more than just me asking himself where he really belongs. Because of the 40 year long mix-up in Alsace Lorraine. From 1870 to 1914, when WWI started. Then you are from Alsace. Only my mother was. When she fell in love with a german hussar, she didn't ask on which side her sons will be fighting. This was decided by the war. Did you serve in WWI? Yes. With a spiked helmet. And the soldiers on both sides of the front were eaten alive by vermin. That makes 2 wars. - Yes. 2 too many. And now let's talk about something different. Do you also want to eat our chicken? What's that? You are peeing in a strange manner. Now you are relieved. What are you doing here on your own at this time? I got lost. I don't know the way to the village. With everything that's on the road these days, it's better not to get lost. It's simple. The road is up there. Turn right and go ahead towards the village. Many thanks. Such a crazy world. When even the girls are peeing whilst standing. We were wrong. They weren't american tanks, they were german ones. - What happened then? Well, everybody hid. Apart from the mayor. He ran out with his american flag. When he was spotted by the German, he got killed by a sub-machine-gun. Bravo! But is was stupid that the mayor had the flag with him right in front of them. You are the stupid ones! If I was your father I would prevent any similar pranks, you can be sure about that! Victor said the same, but we didn't do it deliberately. Who is Victor? - That's my uncle. He told the policemen that he will put us straight into reformatory, if we get caught. Because of this, we ran away. You would have deserved it. And the third boy? Gaby? He got caught this morning, while he tried to steal some eggs. He will get a proper beating. His father is sending him to a priest seminar to become a pastor or a butcher. Just my luck. To meet two brats on the run. Maybe they will recognise your brother. Then he will return with somebody other than the doctor. But no, that's impossible. Because he is dressed up like a girl. Nobody would recognise him. We will see about that. I don't want to see this coming. You will help me to hide somewhere else. Oh No! I am not going away from here. Just listen, jerk. I can't walk for miles. I just want to play safe. You will see your brother if he comes back with a doctor. Promise. Are you telling the truth? - I swear. But you need to help me. And trump card. - Very good. And another one. That was it then. - No wonder, with this deck. Anything else? Is this all you need, little girl? I would like to have a bottle of red wine. The open one? - Yes, but I don't have a bottle. That doesn't matter. I will give you one. But that's three pence more. - Ok. Where does the doctor live? You are looking for a doctor? I am sorry, child. There has been no doctor for a long time. You're not from here, aren't you? No, we are refugees. The doctor should come to see my injured father. His pain is so severe, that he can't even walk. Could it be, that your father has a broken bone, my child? I think so. Yes. Well, if this is the case, then he won't need a doctor. I will tell you where to go. Stop kicking the metal. There! He is Back! ANTOINE! Shut your trap. I will wait until he is closer. Quiet. I am here. I've bought bread, sausage and a bottle of red wine. Hey, Julien?! Hey, Julien?! Where are you two? Shit! Answer me! Julien! TEX! Run! Look for him! Can I go too? - No, don't move. I still need either of you. At least, it's you. Where are they? Where is Julien? Antoine, over here. I have been looking for you! It was him. He wanted to hide. He was afraid, you would betray him. I just wasn't sure. That's not nice. I was afraid back there. I thought he did kidnap you. I did not harm your brother. That's not true. He wanted to stab me and he ate all my pears. Your pears?! I am really getting annoyed now! What's that? And what's down there? A German uniform and a German steel helmet! And what's beneath my uniform? A German, as you did say! Do you have any idea what we Germans did for 4 years? Occupied the whole of Europe! EVERYTHING! I refuse to get judged by two brats. Because of such silliness. Because of pears. - You better watch yourself. I can also be nasty. Where is the doctor, you wanted to bring? He is dead. What do you mean? - I don't know, but ... But what? Are you making fun of me? Is there no doctor in the shithole? Do you think I want to endure this pain any longer? I am in pain! Do you understand?! The pain is unbearable. That is not our fault. There is no doctor, but I know where to bring you. What did you tell there about me? Nothing! I said, you are my father. A real lucky one, your father. And where shall I go? Hospital is not an option. No hospital. She thinks your leg is fractured like hers. And the tight witch is almost as good as a doctor. What are you saying? I don't understand. I swear. She had the same. Now she is just slightly limping. I didn't fracture any bone. It's not about this. His bum hurts. - My back hurts. My back! Who is this tight witch? - A quacker. A sorceress? Not a bad idea! Where does she live? Not far from here. I did see her house on the way. But it's more than 1 kilometre away. 1 kilometre? And how do you think I will manage 1 kilometre? Just getting here was almost too much. You will get her here. Get going! It's no use if I go there. She is not going anywhere, because of her varicose veins. Because of varicose veins. And what shall I do? Call a taxi? Ouch! Ouch! I hope it's not that much further. I have had enough. Don't get worn out back there. Ain't I moaning? Yes! You don't stop crying ouch ouch ouch. I am only saying ouch ouch ouch, because I feel every turning of the wheel... through my entire body, if you can imagine that. You don't say. Can't be much further, if your brother... told the truth. There it is. We are there. We are lucky, it's going downhill soon. Didn't I tell you? Get on, push. And stop moaning. Get going, dog. Pull, you lazy thing. I have to do all on my own. Ouch! Erm? What? That is one funny group. Good evening, madame. Can you cure ill people? - It depends. And what do you want? It's about him. - It's my back. I pinched my sciatica nerve two days ago. It's frustrating I can hardly walk. Are there no doctors in the German army left? - I just have unbearable pain. That's right. He really is in pain. - We can't pull him any further. Do you have any money? - Yes, I do. Good. Let's see what I can do. That's 1500 francs and the chicken. No no, the chicken is ours. - That's right. Antoine did get it with his slingshot. And who did pluck the chicken? If she wants the chicken, she will get it. Understood?! That's so mean. And who did find the sanipractor? And what about bringing you here? Yes, but now I don't need you anymore. Get lost. That's so impudent. And where shall we go now, as it is getting dark? Erm. - Just tell me. There is more to your story, isn't there? I will only let all of you in, if you have made a decision. Otherwise you can stay outside. What? Please wait. Here. That's for your chicken. Don't forget that the sausage from before was free. But we only got one slice. Stop this and pull me up to the door. Agreed. But we don't care, if she can't cure you. Ok. Just push. - Go on, Tex. Damn shit. These urchins cost me my last nerve. You also have to pull the trousers down, so that I can see. Can we send them to the next room? These two? No, there is only one room here. And they won't go blind from the german army undies. If you want my help, lie down there. Lie down on your stomach. There it is. Of course. It radiates up my back and through my bum into my legs at the same time. Inevitably. With you playing war at your age. That wasn't my idea. - An elephant's sciatica. Hey, be very careful. I want to live through this damn war. Nobody is as careful as me, my boy. Now take a deep breath. It's done. We did it. You stay in this position and get some bandages. If it hasn't helped, I have to do it again in one hour. Damn female. That's worse than being rolled over by a tank. Did it hurt? - Didn't you hear him crying out in pain? If you would have been in the ditch in two wars, you would know how this feels. Hey girl? Do you like the tight witch's food? Hey girl, is it fine? - Shut up, you baby. I would like to have some food too. You! Will drink this first. The tea has to be fresh, all down in one go. It tastes horrible. This helps? The brew won't harm you. Go on, drink it. If you can't walk tomorrow, you can shoot me dead. And this on top of all the pears. I hope he has a strong stomach. Yuck! What was that? Everybody's the same with this. I always make more of it. Even when you spit it out, there is enough in your system. May I put a foot down? You can pull your trousers up. And lie down to sleep. And tomorrow you can walk right up to Berlin... But if you have deserted, my boy. No, I am not curious. I am just curing bumps and wounds. As long as you enjoy hitting each other's noses, the tight witch can't complain about lack of work. Why are you called tight witch? Because! I am tight. That's the way in the countryside. Taking their money is worse than sucking their blood. Is there a place to sleep? In peace? Calm down now. It's past bedtime. I have to recover. Stop it Julien! There! Look at the sky. How beautiful, isn't it? Looks like it's being watched. Ah good. It's great when the pain eases. Are you really a deserter? - No I am not. The others went ahead. I just let them go on. That's the same. Why have you deserted? Have you been afraid of getting beaten up by the Americans? It's about reason, not about being afraid of the Americans. Only the daft ones go on, when the outcome is clear. I don't care, if the boys are stupid enough to get killed at the Rhine or the Danube, only to protect Hitler's bunker. I have my iron cross. I have earned it. And now leave me in peace, so I can sleep. Good night. - Good night. And from now on, sleep elsewhere than in the ditch! I will try! Thank you! - Goodbye! IT WORKS! Damn female. I almost would be a new man without the uniform. Hey, listen up. I have to tell you two something. I like both of you. You are funny. We like you two, although you are German. That's the way it is. I think it's time for goodbye now. Why? Aren't you coming along to Lyon? To Lyon? It's not about that. I can't walk the streets with you and the dog. And I need civilian clothing pretty soon. But even with civilian clothes, I have to hide and take detours. Understand? What's the difference? We can't get caught ourselves. You only have to disguise as french and will be regarded as our father. Yes. But I'm not your father. If they ask me for your IDs? Just leave him alone, Julien. As he can walk on his own, we are not needed any longer. Don't you see? Yes I know. You two helped me out of trouble. Here, we're even. Keep your money. So far we managed on our own. Are you offending us? Ok, I agree. You two are getting the food and the dog. So you are not alone. Listen! Just stay with them and take care of them. Ok? Sit. I think, it's better this way. Let me go ahead, until you can't see me any longer. Good luck. This shithead is a betrayer, no deserter. - Calm down. He will get caught in no time. Tex! Bite his bum! Have you gone crazy? Let me go! Enough! Yes. I got it! Stop barking! Stop it! You have won, it's ok. Get over here. Hey! Stop rocking. I am a good horse, but... Your gun is also pretty heavy. What do you think? This is no war for little girls! I did not say that I can't carry it, only that it is heavy. You up there have some nerve to laugh. I didn't whine after 3 kilometres that my feet hurt. But you are not wearing clogs. Don't start again. Go on. Dismount. I have to pee. Hand this over. That's no toy. What a shame. It was funny, though. If you have to pee, do it now. We won't stop every 3 kilometres. Don't you have to pee, too? - No. What are you doing here? What's with the German? Mhm. - Did you catch him? Come to me! We did find him, as he was sleeping in he field over there. We did... take his rifle. That's the way it was. He is our prisoner. What a mess! Did you search him? No? Great job, kids! War is not a western game, ok? Don't move! But he isn't dangerous. He just wants to go home. Not dangerous? Bullshit. Shit. I am in trouble now. I have to take an important message to Merac and can't take care of this Fritz. Damn. We will guard him. No problem. And if he tries to escape, we will kill him. Can you at least handle the rifle? - Check it yourself. I did load it myself. I only need to pull the trigger. - Let's see. Target him. - No No. You don't need to kill me. Hitler is kaput. Not as yet. I am trusting you two. Take him to Coulain's farm. Our people will take care of him there. And where is it? - Straight ahead, at the end of the path. Only 500 meters. Ok. I will go now. Ah, the password: Scarecrow. - Scarecrow. Let him march 10 meters ahead to stop him acting stupid. Yes, 10 meters. Is this his dog? No that's ours. - It did bite his bum. Ok. I am trusting you. - No problem. Tell him, he will be killed, if he wants to escape. I am cycling now. Watch it, you. 10 meters. Get a move, German! - Don't try anything stupid, otherwise...! Has he gone? - Not just yet. He is still turning around. Just walk slowly. Tell me, when he is out of sight. Then we go into the cornfield. Now, I can't see him anymore. This way. Hey wait up! I have a stitch! We showed that jerk. Now I owe you. Without you I would sit in the trap and the "scarecrow" would have been caught. And you? No, you don't need to kill me. Hitler is kaput! Yes. Yes. 10 meters. We earned a toast. Would you like a picnic here? - Hurray! Hey, keep it quiet. We can't be seen, but we might be heard. We might alarm the whole district... and the tight witch's chicken is not enough for all resistance fighters. Go on. Is this the iron cross? - Mhm. And this? What's your rank? General? No, a soldier's rank: corporal. Supervising officer of the latrine cleaning commando. Hey, look at him. Hey, take it slowly with the bottle. It's good. It warms me up. He is tipsy. - Damn rascals. No chance to turn a blind eye. Hey, pass it over, before you lose your balance. I can't carry you all the time. Go on and pack the things. We want to get going. Let's go. Take the bottle. You can carry it. I don't want to. Here. Can you just tell me your name? Franz Joseph Boeringer, like my father. Sounds funny. You have strange names. Why strange? It's a good name. And your last name? How are you called? I am called Morant. Nobody knows Julien's last name. But I am called Morant as well, the same as you. That's not true. His father is unknown. Liar. Are you crazy? I know as well as you, who my father is. Hey, stop it. Morant or not, stop shouting. Do you understand! I am telling the truth. The policeman has read it in his ID. It states there that his father is unknown. Just ask Gaby, if you don't believe me. You're such a mean liar. You also don't have a father. You have never seen him. Don't listen to him. That's just the police's story. Listen up, Julien. The IDs don't prove anything. Of course you have a father like everybody else. Your mother didn't get you from the holy spirit. I now exactly where he is from. Just like Victor said. As my dad went to the Isle de Rey, mother became a whore. You're the son of a whore! Shut your trap, you idiot. LIAR! Stop it. I've had enough. Why did I end up with you two fools? Two brothers who fight and insult each other like two beggars. Don't you think the last 4 years fighting wasn't enough? Do you really want to take part? Ok then. Take my rifle and kill each other. Then it's settled. There they are, your Americans. Doesn't take long to blow up. Your nonsense almost got me discovered. Hide fast. Hide! I am giving you a hand. - Yes, hurry up. He is from the militia. - These shits are working for the Germans. I am aware. I know them quite well. I just wonder what he is doing here in the woods. - Maybe they want to have sex here. Here is the suit that you wanted to have. And the cap as well. And where is he money? In the suitcase, too? Yes, everything that was there. Very good. Give me a hand. Where does the pair in love want to go? Good day. You did frighten me I almost thought... Don't bother. Step out of the trousers, you won't need them. But you won't kill me, whilst I am changing my clothes? I supported you, right until the end. Isn't that right, Yosette? That's the truth. Right up to the end. - Now you have to see things, as they are. I am seeing things as they are. You want to disappear and so do I. But there is only one pair of trousers and I have the rifle. That can't be true. Excuse me, father. Do you know how to get into Lyon without trouble? Let's see. The safest road is via Reillanne and Banon. But not too fast, the Germans are still around. Are you sure? - I wouldn't take the chance. You should spend the night in Reillanne because of the kids. Next to the square. You can rely on me, I know the landlord quite well. - Thank you, father. Do you think too that we should sleep in the hotel? Yes, I have never eaten in a restaurant. - Are we going to sleep in a real bed? I think so. Don't forget that I am your uncle. And they stole your ID and we are living in 12, Rue de Marshall Foche. - In Lyon. The food and bed will be well earned. Ok. Everybody off. Are you buying us a lemonade with the money from the suitcase? Yes. But be quiet. We are not talking about this money. What dump is this? No one to see. Dinnertime. What do you want? - I want a Coco, if this is okay. Yes, you can have one. Good evening to you. Is anybody there? Here are some customers. Nobody there? Be quiet doggy. Where is your owner? Strange hotel. Apparently they don't want to have guests. And? We could steal their cash register easily. Nobody around at all. Stay here. I will have a look around. We are coming along. Is anybody there? They all seem to be deaf. That's strange indeed. Is there anybody? Answer, you bunch of farmers. You're stupid. Maybe it's a game of football. At our place everybody goes there on Sunday night. Apart from the father. I bet they are all at the mass. There won't be a mass at this time of the day. And the front door won't be left when attending mass. Shit, I am thirsty. - And I am very hungry. Than we have to get it ourselves. Let's go. Hey Julien, look at this. A pool table. Do you know how to play pool? - Come on, it's quite simple. I don't know what has happened here. But they really must have been afraid, if they left everything. What to do with the red ball? - You use it to push the others. Like this. So, let's see. A lemonade and some coconut milk and a nice beer for me. Do you find them? - Yes. Did you see? A pool table. Look at this. A whole bottle of lemonade. But it's not cold any longer. That's ok. It's just the bubbles are more shiny, when colder. Aren't you afraid that the landlord is coming? What if? We aren't thieves. When the landlord comes he can take over from me. And we have money to pay. I can't find the coconut milk, so it's the same for you. Then with peppermint. - And grenadine for me. I haven't even tapped my beer yet, you rascals. Put the glasses away from there. You pig. That's quite disgusting, Julien. That's not my mistake. It comes from the fizzy drink. Why did you drink so much then? And it's your turn now. That was nothing. You're such a loser. - You're the loser here. What's the racket in there, you two? Can't you just stop the nonsense? Keep quiet and don't smash everything. How do you like the german cooking? Nice. But you didn't bake the cake yourself. I could have done it. I am quite good in making rhubarb tarts. Is pastry cook your profession in peacetime? Not at all. My profession is horse merchant, like my father before me. Are you married? - No. I never married and I don't have children. Why? Don't you like them? The thought of bringing them up in love, only for them to die in some war, that is what I am afraid of. That's my opinion. It is hard enough for me to save my own skin. Did you really serve in WWI? Indeed. Think how old I really am. It's getting too much. That's already my second one. You must have been quite young then. - Yes, I just had bad luck. On my 18th birthday I was in a ditch near Verdun. You have no idea about the fireworks they displayed over my head. Is that true? As true as them confiscating all my horses, when I was 45. And to win this war, they also recruited me. Did they force you? - What do you think? Old or young, they won't ask you as long as you can carry a gun. You're just good enough to kill the enemy over there. Or to get killed. It just depends. Did you kill French folk? I asked, if you killed French folk? Yes, I did. Both my brothers got killed as well. Was it the French who killed them? Would it really make a difference? All of them died, out of hunger, cold and fear... whatever colour the uniform. It is not mentioned on the war memorials. Only the corpses are being counted. Not the poor souls who vomit and shit their pants out of fear. Not the men who cry: nowhere mentioned. Trust me, not one didn't cry. Why do they cry? They cry out of despair... ...because they don't understand it at all... ...and are afraid of dying. They cried like little children, who want to return to the womb... ...when their bowel spilled out of their abdomen. Stop it. You're getting drunk. It wasn't much easier for those, who returned. It was impossible to forget this. They still cried, together with the living, at the corpses' feast dessert. And didn't dare to look at the dead, which were lying at the cold buffet. What about you? Did you cry afterwards? Afterwards? I lacked the courage for making children with my Alsace girlfriend. Where are you going? - I am cold. What's left is her white hair. And for me to stroke her to the end. That's the reason for me deserting. Stop! Wait up! Please stop! This really is a ghost town. Hey. Come quick. Julien is vomiting. Just what I need. Hurry, he does it all over the place. Turn the light on. Red wine with the cherry cake. No wonder. Did you see how much lemonade he drank? Wow, the bed is great. Make the most of it and lie down! It's after 1 am already! Will you be alright? It probably won't start again with all that's out of your system already. Shall I search for boy's clothes here? I just don't want to run around as a girl any longer. You can do this tomorrow. Just use it as a nightgown. Aren't you going to bed? I am going downstairs to clean up. So the mess will be gone, if the landlord returns. Tomorrow it's your turn, because both of you are filthy. I just wanted to add... that it is nice to be with you, nevertheless. I don't regret it myself, boy, to be together with you two. Now go to sleep. Come here. Let's have a closer look then. Come along. You stand guard here and get me, if someone turns up. Ok?! Forgive me. You would do the same. That should be his size. Go! Search! What are you doing there? To daft to find them? Did you find something? Do you want to get in? Have you become a believer? My God! To do something like this! But why? WHY? HERE! IN YOUR CHURCH! WHY DID YOU LET IT HAPPEN? MURDERED! ALL OF THEM WERE MURDERED! DEAD, EVEN THE SMALLEST CHILD! I STOLE FROM THEM AND THEY ARE DEAD! DON'T YOU HEAR ME? THEY ARE DEAD AND I STOLE FROM THEM! WHERE IS YOUR MERCY? WHERE? Who are you? A german... soldier. We did this. This did belong to them. All of them are dead. All of them. There are two boys in the hotel. (Shut up!) (Come here, you son of a bitch!) Hey, Julien! That's Tex! TEX! What's up? (Ready?!) STOP IT! (Fire!) YOU DOGS! (Poor little kids.) Please forgive me. That's not true what I have said earlier. Do you listen? You are my brother, you are. My real brother.
