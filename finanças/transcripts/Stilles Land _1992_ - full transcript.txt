SILENT COUNTRY Took my kids to the sea. What stress. l lost 4 kilos. You lost weight? -Look at my blouse! You're down at least 6 kilos! Anyway, a lot. -Let's see! Cut it out! You only have one thing on your mind. Places, everybody. Places! Colleagues. Colleagues! l'm pleased to see you all back again... and to welcome you to the 1989/90 SeaSOn. ...500 over the border daily. lmagine how many that'll be in 1 O days, or a year! ...and to get back to work with vigor! Seen Paul yet? The ass still owes me 20 Marks. But first l'd like to present a young colleague... who'll take up his first engage- ment at our theater this year. Not here yet. Hi. Can you tell me where the theater is? Theater? No theater here. There must be. -lf you already know, why ask? The theater's along here. Where? Around the corner. Thanks. -Staying long? Services are on Sunday. l'm an atheist. The premiere of ''William Tell'' was well attended. About 1 70 in the audience. You sat home all summer writing? God, you're nuts. ...60 and 80 spectators. Once unfortunately only 10... but there was the Europa Cup. ''The Good Little Witch'' Anything wrong? ...''Sleeping Beauty'', 50, the hit of the season. ''King Quack''... Say something about Hungary... and the Prague Embassy! The country is SILENT! Horst! But it i's true. -l can only give you my opinion. What does the Party say then? Ah, finally, here's our new colleague. Better late than never. Please come right up on stage. Welcome. Dear colleagues. This is our new director. Kai Finke. 26 years young. Very gifted. l'd even say, a talent. A talent. Here! Welcome to the stage that's all the world... l'll look after you. What's with Paul? -Call him, to play it safe. l'll write the report as usual... or should l mention the incident? Let sleeping dogs lie. -Which dogs? Just an expression. Don't believe that ass. He gets rid of anyone better than he is. The lobby. A victim of his hobbies. Drank himself to death. Ah, the ''Tell''. l did it last year. The Swiss Oath before a closed curtain. V-effect, so to speak. Our fleet. There's a trip Tuesday. And? Do you like the play? Sure, in an of itself... Of course some asked:. What's this Irish play got to do with us? But we must be open-minded -- in the arts, at least. Don't you think? But...how to do the play, so that everyone understands it? l mean.. The important thing is to get it on stage. We have to attract attention. Small stars must shine brighter or they won't be seen. Understood or not -- one shouldn't have illusions in a place like this. l've already thought it out... Ah, concepts. The stage. Auditorium. A graphic black line cuts right through the stage... Can l speak to Paul? Not home yet? lt's about the show. To Hungary... That would be Act 2's key pivot in this version. For Vladimir, l mean. But the first version is naturally the best. l think the stage itself brings clarity. And theater must be comprehensible, or it's not effective, right? Hmm. l understand. ls this the cafeteria? Can l get some food here? Nope. And when does it open? Evenings. lf at all. NO LUNCH SERVICE A tea, please. Drunken pig! Give me my money back, you scum-bag!!! Give back that dough or... l'll rip your balls off!!! Who ordered the tea? Tea? Didn't you order a tea? Me? Uh, yeah. Can l help you? Here. Your eye looks pretty bad. Needs ice. Wait a second. Here, lay that on it. Go on, do it! Thanks, by the way. l'm Claudia. Assistant director. Girl Friday. -Kai. l know. Been here long? A year. -And? As you can see... First meeting with the natives? ''Volkshaus''... A tip from Theo. Good food, he said. Food! At ''Volkshaus''! Super. And for tea! -lt's even better for tea! And with script...Remember, Theo? Claudia! Seen who's it? The stage manager? -No. Where's the ass hiding? l'll go look. Good grief...You were the one who wanted tea at ''Volkshaus''? Finally. Where were you? l need to be announced or l can't get into it. Right away, Uschi. You sure you really want to do this to yourself? Why? Aren't you performing too? Precisely. Good evening, ladies & gentlemen. l'm afraid l have some bad news. Paul Schrader, who plays the role of the valet, is seriously ill. Rather than cancel tonight's play Claudia Stoll will read his part. Thank you very much for your understanding. We're truly sorry. He'd better come back. -He won't. Want a drink? -Not so loud. We're in a theater. Once and for all! This is serious. My daughter and the Baron fight. Our reputation... The President will hear of it... Short and sweet, l'll buy him out. You didn't talk him into coming here... nor thrown your daughter at him. Ha! Haven't talked him into it or thrown her at him. Who'll take notice? Wonder where Paul is. He's gone. Maybe he missed the train. Oh no. He's on the right train. The ass owes me 20 Marks. You'll get it back in West Marks someday. Screw that! Am l bothering you? Tell me, your name is Finke. Any relation to the Finke... from the Berlin Theater... named Iris, like the perfume, Iast did the Stuart... do you know her? No? l could have sworn you had something to do with her. What a slut, let me tell you. When we studied together... who'd guess l'd be stuck out here... and me as Mary Stuart... no, crap, l was Iphigenia... and Finke was the Stuart... Finke, the old cow, a good thing she's not your mother... so, when are we playing the mother... crap, what's-her-name, Manja, hahaha, M-a-r-i-a... Closing time! -Okay!!! Let's go somewhere else. We can gab a little bit. Coffee? ln Pasewalk, the farmers of the cooperative ''Advance''... have harvested the grain 2 weeks early. They belong to the many initiatives... undertaken for our Republic's 40th anniversary, and... Typo! No. l've already written it down. Page 4! True. Yeah. Yeah. ''Waiting for Godot'' with a woman...interesting. Hey! Has Hollywood called yet? -No, and when, it would be for me. Has no one shown up yet? We all used to be here 30 min. before rehearsal... right Horst? l don't get why l play a man. There are no female roles. -Aha. So l have to play a man. Great. Can you give me a clue how? As a man or as a woman? Hey! l'm talking to you. -Leave her alone. Okay, okay. l'll leave her alone. The ''artist'' will tell me. Here you are. -As always. Then let's start. -Not everyone's here. Why not? Rehearsal starts at 10. Good morning everyone. Good day ! Listen, sorry. My alarm clock... Buy a new one. Stop that scribbling! lt makes one nervous. Get going! Stupid shit! Now you'll get it! The first rehearsal! lt's the most important of all. l... l couldn't sleep at all. Sorry kids, had to shower at the neighbors. My hot water heater broke. This is no way to do theater! This sloppiness. l simply have to tell you:. it's...it's... it's ignorant! l won't tolerate this in the future. Seriously now. Otherwise, l hate to say l'll have to look for another cast. Let's get on with my proposals. You've got your work cut out. We do, yes. Our work's cut out for us. You've also read it after all. l think the piece has something special. Something... lncomprehensible. -...absurd. Above all, it mirrors today. l Mean... the parallels are clear. Things can't go any further, not forward or backward. And so one waits. No idea for what. Two people wait for someone, not really knowing for whom. This waiting has a name:. Godot. Who Godot is, what he looks like why one waits... is totally unimportant. What counts is that he's waited for... Say, when does this Godot appear? ...for him or something else. Where does this hopelessness occur? ln one's head or through circumstance? A good question. Yeah, um, l mean...the...the hopelessness... l have a question. My idea would be... that l enter at the start, not the middle of Act 1. See... l'm stage front with my leash around my neck... waiting for my master. l'm waiting too, get it? You just want to be seen. That's not true. One barely makes a suggestion, and already... l'll get to you later. The two main characters first. We've got Vladimir and Estragon. l'd like... Estragon to be a woman. The two should be an old couple. They've been through it all, but nOW... can't talk to each other anymore. GDR citizens flee to West German embassy... And now the weather. Low front from the Atlantic to Scandinavia. Further prospects:. little change. This was news from ''Deutschlandfunk''... Here are the drawings. Good. l've already needed them. Well, then... -Come on in. Listen, l was thinking... we put... a car on stage! With a tree growing out of the hood. The possibility to move... has sort of landed on the scrap heap? See? And so it's stuck on stage, right? Yeah...the question is what kind of car? l mean it sounds stupid, but when you really think about it... l mean... To good teamwork! ln the end, it's political. Take a seat! Technical problems aside... Oh, my goodness! Good lord! The set designer has to see these! Shit! Shit! Shit! -l'm sorry. lt took ages to do. l'm sorry. Careful! You're smearing them. lt's not too bad, is it? -''Not too bad?'' lt's totally smeared! And you say, ''it's not too bad.'' Man oh man. Claudia? Claudia! ...GDR citizens who in accordance with the Madrid Accord... were allowed to travel to West Germany and West Berlin... ...have applied to return to the GDR. The proper authorities have said... that such a request... can't be met. Did you read it? Faster! Here pig! Excuse me, please. -ln a minute! What is it? -What's with the hat? The hat? l think it's good. -Not in my rehearsal. l think it's good. Take it off. Then start again. Excuse me, but on the board outside... Faster! Here pig! l told you to take off the hat. l did. -Get rid of it. Completely. Everything without the hat. lf you don't like how l take it off, l can throw it. Look, like this! Adds some atmosphere, eh? No! We could put a hat stand here... or just the tree. l hang the hat... on the tree, see? No? Okay, okay, l'd like to contribute, and you... But please, have it your way. There's a note on the board... you must read it. What's wrong? l can't do it. Without the hat. lt was here before. Who took it down? Performance in 1 5 minutes. A propman on stage, please. Who took it down? He's writing some thesis, Uschi says. l'm somehow sorry for him. Why? And how did you get here? By train... The first time in the theater... The curtain rises... The actors, lights, the stage... You're suddenly in another world. l was to have a respectable job. My parents and l fought. l wrote to some theaters. The only offer came from Walz. So now l'm here. We'll see if Godot comes. A wonderful good morning. Certain West German groups are planning further provocations... on the GDR's 40th anniversary... to disrupt peace and order. Such as the current spectacle at West Germany's embassy in Prague. How such a development serves West German efforts... to improve relations... lt wouldn't hurt to clean the showcases. Still hanging. -Like l said. lt won't work. The band is marching up front!... The East! ...a media event East Berlin would have loved to prevent... ...one starts to sweat... l said so. -But it was there. Protuberances. -What? Protuberances! Needs a larger antenna. l have one... in Berlin. l just don't get it. lt's not working. l can't play this anymore. lt...it was very good. Just do it once again. lt...it was really good, truly depressing. Do it once more. Please! There! We can't. Why not? -We're waiting for Godot! Ah! That was it. That... That was it! -Really good. Awful. -What? Awful and anachronistic. You maybe. Do it again Horst! Just so! l don't see the problem here. Waiting, waiting! l can't hear it anymore. Nothing more comes to mind. But you just had it. Exactly the despair l intended. As if you wanted to blow up the walls around you. What's with you? Everything's clear! Do it again. Go ahead... stay so aggressive! Don't yell! You beginner! What's with him? We're all a bit edgy. RESISTANCE And? What do we do now? After consultations with the CSSR a resolution... for visa-free travel by GDR citizens... between the GDR and CSSR was temporarily interrupted. l can't concentrate anymore! This damned ignorance. We should cancel this today. l suggest we sit down together... and draw up a letter, a resolution. ...you're just the one to call me an opportunist. You just sit over your writing all day. When did you ever open your mouth? Earlier maybe! But a damned long time ago. He didn't mean it. -Can't we... Felix isn't so wrong, l think... l tell you! l'll just shut up. Have a drink first. Maybe we can still agree on the wording. If not ''demand'', then... Embarassing! Prattle! Write ''please''... and you can count me out! Write:. We demand open discussion! Right! ''Op.Dis.'' l won't say anymore. But if that falls into the wrong hands... they'll close us down. That'll be an accomplishment. But do what you want. Who are we sending this to? What do l know? To Honecker...the Party, Politburo, Press... lt must be made public. Do you think we should talk to Walz first? He'd shit in his pants. l think we'd best start from the bottom up. Theater, local and then regional management... Man, get off me! You can all kiss my ass! Well l'll read it again. The situation in our country has become alarmingly critical. Thousands are fleeing to the West... because life here seems unbearable. Rather than seek the reasons... the official and media reaction has been denial and insinuation. l'll check on Felix... So where was l? We'll discuss it tomorrow. Now don't be mad... It'll be fine. Maybe we should make it a bit more personal. ''Dear Erich, now really, we're fed up. Always wanted to tell you this. So why don't you grab that Margot of yours, and enjoy your old age in Peking...'' Get any further? Tomorrow...tomorrow is another day, right guys? Right! C'mon Theo. Theo! Finished? Good evening! l... Here, that's the whole ensemble's opinion. We must go public immediately. The Party's still missing. l'll forward this. VIGIL Almost all atheists, like you. Won't he object? Not HIM. Still with Godot? You mean we're to start from the beginning? You mean we're to start from the beginning? The whole shit again? The...you know...it wasn't bad... the hopelessness. We build up, we tear down, always working. Let him finish! Man oh man... but it's clear! lt's the fault of those two that they're stuck. l don't get what's not to get! Hopelessness...it's crap. It doesn't exist. Only in their heads, The question is rather:. why don't they finally move? What are they waiting for? This Godot is... maybe, somewhere, he's God. God? Why God? Well, Godot almost sounds like... -Why not God? l mean, he doesn't show up. l Mean... in case you don't believe in God. Which l don't. That is, one never knows. Everything remains undecided. l mean...it's up to oneself... l mean, we must be God ourselves...don't we? lt would suit you. So Horst didn't comment on your new concept? l think it's better now. Now come, come here. C'mon. Come here. Look, lovely milk. Don't make a mess! Throw the beast out! Be a good cat! You make me nervous looking at me like that. l like to look at you. Your expression is so forceful when you work... Please! Want to go to the Baltic next weekend? Would do you good... to think of other things. Excuse me! But l've no time for such things. l have to change the entire concept! Throw that beast out! l've told you cats make me nuts. l feel somehow...somehow... threatened! l really must concentrate, understand? l...l...l don't have time to fool around... for walks, pointless talks, cats... Man oh man... To think we open in three weeks... You shouldn't have come! lt's really mean. You can have fun. You just have to plan rehearsals. Don't move! Won't get any better. ...the police are ruthlessly beating some demonstrators... Can you come please? He's already angry. This can't be true! For the third time! l'll throw him out! l mean it! -He's in Berlin. For the antenna. -Should be back by now. Work is work. Tina - you'll read Theo's lines. That's that. Get going! Go, Go! What am l, a circus horse? Please! Faster! Back! l can only do it with Theo. Again. You have to stumble and fall. Faster! Back! Very good. Even better! Come on.. But... He's scared stiff, the ass. Ladies and gentlemen, dear audience. The times we're living in require... that we speak out. We can't remain silent... or tolerate what's going on any Ionger. Therefore, before the performance... And we therefore demand, for us and our country, open discussion! And? What do we do now? WE ARE THE PEOPLE! THOUGHTS ARE FREE... Piece of crap. Now it's starting. What? -Berlin Soccer Club vs. Monaco. Dear citizens of the German Democratic Republic. The central committee of the SED... has appointed me general secretary today. l've thanked them for their confidence. l am aware of and accept this tremendous responsibility. With today's session we will initiate a change... and will regain the political and ideological offensive. lf you asked me what has moved me the most at this time... there would be only one answer:. the thought of all the work we have to do together. To talk with each other and to argue is important... and to mutually communicate is essential. But to work together to plan our perspective and rule rationally remains the deciding factor. A mountain of work lies before us and all citizens. And no one has a magic potion... to cope with it overnight. Here! l sat in jail for this stupid thing. And here you sit! Don't you know what's going on? -We had a demo too. Know what's going on in Berlin? Never seen so many cops in my life. More cops than people. With real water cannons, clubs helmets... ...we can't live beyond our means and we were never into promises. Come, drink up first. So l'm in the train, with my antenna wondering why we're not moving. Suddenly:. ''Everybody out!'' The platform was packed with cops. So l got off the train. lD control. Well l didn't worry, it being a holiday. A cop asked me what was in the package. Me:. a TV antenna. Him:. Where you taking it? And l say:. On the train. Home. Aha, says he, then come along with me. They emptied half the car. l even told him l was an actor and so on. Had to get to a performance. Know what he said? Today's another show and we decide what plays. Four whole weeks? For such a short piece? lt's... The concept's no longer up to date. We can't help it! We have a schedule here. At most a week. And then we must premiere. The auto goes here. We have to spray it black. We'll naturally have to change the graphic line in the back. lt can't be black. Rather white... and the rest black. And the tree... -Workshop's closed, thank you. Come here, fast! They're opening the Wall! Shut up, will you! Be quiet!!! Can't hear! -l didn't say anything. Madness, sheer madness!!! Hey!!! lt's not working! And we sit here. We could get there in 2-3 hours. Too late for a train. With our bus... To the center of world history, everybody! Humpty Dumpty sat on the wall... Freedom!!! C'mon, let's get going! Don't blow it, Norbert. Move, you idiot thing! Everybody out! You're not serious. Everybody push! Somehow l didn't expect this. Hey, give us a hand! -And so onto Berlin... Could've been in Pasewalk by now. -Piece of crap! Can you make anything out? -Make anything out? All old junk here. We going soon? Thi's i's our of freedom. Now, now... -But it i's true! Can't you cut out that shit? -Okay, okay. l'm going. l'll be in the cafeteria. Call Me... The Wall will be closed again by then. Just because this dump can't afford a decent bus! l just want to take a look and go back home. Listen, how about hitchhiking to Berlin? Cars are always going that way. And back? There's rehearsal tomorrow. Actually today. We can take the train. C'mon! Otherwise we'll freeze stiff. This bus is going nowhere. We'll have to leave as soon as we arrive. And if you cancelled rehearsal just once? lt's a special occasion. Cancel it? Postpone the premiere? Again? Now listen... Please! Do something crazy for OnCe... and forget the dumb rehearsal. Excuse me if l touched you... No problem. Then l'll go alone. Have fun. ...a day such as this should never pass... ...this'll be fun, l thought. Hundreds of cops on the platform. One wants to see my ID. Something's fishy, l thought. Stay cool, l told myself, or they'll be onto you. But l flipped out anyway. Couldn't help it. Just imagine, this cop's asking:. ''What's in the package?'' That's my business, l said. Can you imagine his face? Can't you just shut up? What's with the tone? l was the one in jail for that bloody TV. Oh, why don't you all just kiss my ass... The Wall, the Wall must fall... This is the end. Now we can go everywhere. Just made it. You could've called at least. Four days, and nobody knew where you were. - Right? l'm sorry... -Rehearsal didn't start anyway. No heating. -They're working on it. For you. This is Thomas... from West Berlin. He's in theater too, and has worked with Strasberg... Could he look around a bit? l'm the manager here, so to speak. l'd like to warmly welcome you. As the first herald of a new age, so to speak. Sorry, but this is a key run-through. We're all a bit nervous so close to the premiere. l'd really rather not. Don't be angry, but... No, it's clear. l understand. Well then:. Good luck! So, let's start. Once from the beginning. l'll freeze my ass off. Did you remember the suitcase? Yes. We looked for a new one... want to see it? -Felix... show me the new suitcase. Just a minute. So, here it is. Such a big one??!! l wanted a suitcase, not a wardrobe!!! What were you thinking of? Nobody can do knee-bends with that! l thought we cut that. -Nonsense! The other was too heavy. Listen when l say something. Think! Man oh man. If l don't do everything myself... l also understood you to say... Crap - besides which, it's in the text, which you can all check... Alright, a new one by next rehearsal. But write it down please, if you can't remember. So, let's get started finally. Quiet please! The lobby! He was one of our best. Ah, the Tell. l directed it last year. A big success. Our fleet. -Our standstill, you mean. So then, tomorrow in Hollywood! lt was awful. l found it very good. Considering you changed so much. You have to give them some time. Plus l felt... -l just don't know... how else to explain it to them... you see, they're so... l mean, they try hard but... they just can't do it. Maybe l can't do it either. l'm probably just... mediocre. Don't think about it too much. Think about...what do l know?.. the river Peene... or that the leaves are falling or something... you're too tense. lt's only a play - and it's sure to be good. Claudia! Sorry, about before. Already forgotten. lt was...it was unfair. lt's okay. -Bye! Well then... -l wanted... that is... lt's no good anymore. Because of that one? But...but...you used to have such good taste. l don't get it, l mean... all right, he has a car, but otherwise? l mean, he...he... what are you two going to talk about? Mickey Mouse comics and bubble gum pictures? Well, better than Bloch, Fromm and the Leap of Faith. - Idiot! A real theater! lt's got all you need! A large stage, dressing rooms, equipment - even a fleet! Many of us can only dream of it. l don't understand you. What more do you want? It's great! What does it take to do theater? A stage and imagination. And you've got that! And now everything is possible! You just sit around! l don't get it. Just picture it:. a real touring company. There's a huge market for that. After all, people all want to be entertained. That's not bad. Especially out here where there's nothing else. lt's really great:. a theater in this area. You've just got to make the most of it. And now you can do totally different plays. l mean:. all literature is now open to you... ...''Waiting for Godot'' is such a good idea! You need publicity! Also decent posters and maybe flyers. And we must invite the press. l'll call Bressler tomorrow. He's a friend of mine, from TV. Culture Dept. They always need something new. Oh they'll come. For sure! Everyone in the dress rehearsal on stage, please. A technician to the signal box. Dress rehearsal begins in 1 O minutes. All participants on stage please. Dress rehearsal begins now. Everyone on stage please. WAITING FOR GODOT PREMIERE Super! Any phone calls? -No. That thing can't stand here! Hot off the press:. posters... -So fast? No problem. Just the driving... -Let's see! Did you remember press photos? With or without autograph? What are we doing here, that is the question. And we are blessed to know the anSWef. Yes, in this immense confusion one thing alone is clear. We are waiting for Godot to COMe. Ah! Or for night to fall. We have kept our appointment, and that's an end to that. We are not saints but we have kept our appointment. How many people can boast as much? Billions. You think so? l don't know. You may be right. -Help! All l know is that the hours... are long, under these conditions... And constrain us to beguile them with proceedings which... how shall l say... which at first sight seem reasonable... until they become a habit. You may say it is to prevent... our reason from foundering. No doubt. But has it not been... long straying in the night with- out end of the abyssal depths? That's what l sometimes wonder. You follow my reasoning? We all are born mad. Some remain so. lt was...it was...l'm at a loss for words. l, l'm, what can l say? l'm touched... lt had wit! It had tempo! It was dramatic! Just as l always imagined it. lt seems like a miracle to me. What got into you? All of a sudden! Fantastic! You must do it that way tonight. Absolutely! ldentical! l don't know...Wow Uschi! Good work. And, um... do wear something else tonight... BRESSLER! Yes! Listen, l've been trying for days! l don't see what's so complicated. lt's 7:.30. Third bell. The performance is beginning. What do you mean ''overloaded''? l only want to call Mainz, not the Maldives. Maybe a bus was cancelled. A traffic jam. Surely. And? Let's start. The performance has started. Philistines! You were great. Not bad...for an atheist. Really. You've more faith than you think. As for the rest:. don't be upset, it's empty at my place too. God doesn't need a full house. Hey, where's that TV team of yours? Why? l didn't say it was absolutely sure. l did send a telegram but... -A telegram??? You wanted to call! -How - with that phone of yours? l thought you had such good ''connections''! Leave him be. He doesn't have a clue either. Exactly! -What can he do? He did all he could. Took care of the posters... Telephone! For Rautenberg. From Mainz. Dressel or something... There, you see? ''Computer'' -''Publicity'' Hello? Hello!!! Anybody there? Hello!!! But there was someone on?! Hello??!! Disappointed? You needn't be. It was really good. So what? Aren't you coming over? Did the critic find you? Hmm, he liked it. -Great. What about him? So l got off the train with my package. Everywhere you looked:. cops, cops, cops!!! You write and write. And no ass can read it. ...how he stared at me, the birdbrain. Suddenly the cop asked me... ''What's in your...'' -''What's in your package, comrade?'' And l said:. ''What comrade?'' Can you imagine his face? To Hamburg? Well then, good luck! -Thanks. lt's disgusting that he took it off so fast. Wasn't his production... Then we'll be... lf you want to call there again... Waiting for Bressler, waiting for Godot... ...all pigs on stage for scene 4. Pigs please! l'll write. lf you get fed up, just come back. Otherwise, see you in Hollywood! Thanks... Best of luck with your next production. Translation:. Melissa Drier Subtitles by Holland Subtitling
