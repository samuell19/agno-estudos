Get down .... They are the bloody notorious criminals . - Please don't beat me ! Please be seated. Place it there .... Your permit is going to expire after 3 month's. Apply for the request quickly. lt's been orderedthat all the lawsabidingthis matter should be strict. l shall apply for it as soon as possible. l'm not feeling well .... l don't know why are they disturbingthis Old man ? The S.P had claimedthat most of them are not comingfor signing in the register. l think some hadto be departedfrom here. Most of the them are having difficulties. They are having different kinda ailment's. And some can't even walk without the help of others. Even we have some restrictions .... Shall l leave ... There wasa call from Rauf ? Enquiring that why did you visited the Police Station without informing him ? Even l too got scared .... l'm pretty much worried when you visit's the Police Station. lsn't there any problem ? He made me remember that the permit is going to get expired. Grandpa there had been a Comedy Film telecasted in the T.V Grandpa you missed it. Didthe Police-mens beat you Grandpa ? Come along ... Police-mens won't beat your Grandpa. Why are they goingto beat-up this poor Old Man ? My classmatesare sayingthat you will be shot dead by the Police since you are a Pakistani. Grandpa, Will Something like that occur ? Stop your rubbish talk's ... Let him take rest. Your Grandma didn't like it ..... Dad, l will be leaving at evening. Since the kids have to go to their schools. Dad, you must consult a Doctor. You are very weak . You come here let Grandpa take some rest. Can't you leave on tomorrow morning in Rauf's Car. She had to study at night and we haven't taken the booksalong. You are suffering from number of diseases. So go to sleep after taking your medicines. Yet the Almighty is not calling me back. Since your Dad had died quickly, He might have decided to take away your life lately. Dad died by the hands of Britisher's for the sake of the Country. And l might get died asa Foreigner or asan Spy. Everthing is like a Joke. Again started to think unwanted matters. As per your request .... Considering the decent records of a Pakistan Citizen like you... ... had been allowedto reside in lndia for one more year from 15-8-2001 to 1 4-8-2002. During this span you shouldn't compete in any Election's or get into any Political Party or any offence. lf you are found guilty of getting into any of these deeds ... Then the permit for your stay in lndia would be taken back. And must register your sign in the Manjari Police-Station between the 1st and 5th day of every month. l think the officer's had started to think wisely. Many innocent fellows will be saved if they wish. They had carried out these kinda Drama'sa number of times. The superiors over the both side are cruel and un-humanly. Who is going to know about the worry in the heart of the Poor's ? They'll leave after quarelling among each other. Come in Hamsa .... l haven't seen you from a longtime. Please be seated. The Police are a great nuisance. They visit's the house twice in a week. andabuses my Wife and kids. Now l doesn't sit in my house for too long. What to do now ? What should l say now ... How can l ask you to fight a case, who is finding hard to earn his own daily bread. The Police is claiming that l'm a Spy ! ln the recent notice they had asked me to leave the place immediately. lt's mentioned in it .... You don't give up ... Live in the same place which had given you the birth. You will have the help from the natives. Don't sit in your house for too long. There's no other remedy .... You would get into trouble if caught by the Police or the Advocates. l'm confused Moosa Brother ... The sight of my un-married daughter worries me. They are looking after the family after going for work. Who is goingto marry them seeing my condition ? God why am l not still dying ! Let me leave Moosa Brother. Stop ... Stop ! Grandpa l'm searchingfor you since a longtime. When l went to your house they said that you had been to the Advocates Office. And when l went there, you had gone to Police Station. Atlast l hadfound you . How are you going to find me if you search at the time when l'm not available ? Tell me ''Sahipichi'' ... You have started teasing me again calling ''Sahipichi''. You have learn't the language of the Britishersand had read lot of their Books . ... and had earneda Master's degree . Then what shouldthis poor man address you as. We and our Country could make such a progress due to the education impartedto us. Daughter, you shouldn't say this to the Country-mens. Our ancestors didn't fought against them by taking up the education from the Britisher Schools. Varian kuninu and Haji Mussaliar had gone to which colleges to fight against the British Empire ? kids like you won't understandthat. So howfar is my work going on ? For that you must first help me .... l want to know some more things. Grandpa, you must give me those documents to refer. And don't call me ''Sahipichi'' hereafter. Ok as you wish ... l shall provide you the documents. Even if you write anything, nothing good is goingto happen. Yet it's good that the World should be aware of it. You haven't toldanythingabout your childhood. What is there to say, the childhood of a Poor isall the same with sufferingand disaster's. My Father got killed by the hands of Britishers in the Pukotur battle of 1921 . He died when my Mom was pregnant. There were no one to help us. l left my Home town at the age of 12. Brother, please take care of my child well. lsn't this Mumbai a Big Market ? He is my only hope. You don't worry about him. He is like my own Son. So shall we leave .... Come along Son. l wandered in most of the Cities in lndia. To supress my hunger andto look after my family. From Mumbai l learnt the art of making Beedi. From there l had learnt to read and write Malayalam. From there l reached ''Mubarak Beedi'' Company in karachi. Weren't you aware of the lndependence Struggle duringthose days ? Duringthose days poverty and worry about unmarried Sister's had encaptivated my heart. ln Bazar l used to hear People saying the name of Gandhi and Nehru. And l learned more about it when l joinedthe struggle. Andthat too not to a great extent. lt's been too late ... lt won't be good if l stay here further. Mom will get worried .... Shall l leave ... l shall meet you later . Should l drop you till the Bus stop. - No need. ls Advocate Ramakrishnan here ? No, but his assistant hadtold that he would be arriving soon. keep it. . . - Ok. Moosa Shahib had arrived early. Come along. Be seated. So How are you ? Last week the Police Officer hadtold that it's time to renew the Permit. Yes we shall submit it immediately. Along with that shall we pass on one more request of no:92for the Citizenship. There's some possibility for that. lt's been saidthat the Sumit is goingto take place. Rafeeqandthe Convict of the Perundalmana had come. Ask them to wait. - Ok. We can try as you said. Once they had returned it earlier. Now after 8 years back... Have to search the document's. lt's not 8 but 10 year's had passed. Anyways we can try for it once again. The documents might be there in the files. We can claim that you were here in 1950's. We can't apply on the same grounds that we had applied earlier. because at that time we were not able to prove that the Pakistan passport was issued without your wish. Can attach even the request of your wife. And since you have grown oldand has disease's. lsn't this Lawsare meant for the humans ? Don't leave the hope. Afriend of Asharaf had come. He toldthat his daughter is getting some marriage proposals Even she is goingto get married. But she is still studying. She was born when l arrived here after leaving karachi forever. She is our first Grand daughter. From where is the proposal ? No one had come here. They are from the Qatar itself. They are concernedabout the proposal since you are a Pakistani. l'm not a Pakistani. l'm from Pukotur. lt's the truth that is know to us. You are a Foreigner in front of the Law. That's true .... Because of that our Elder Son got settled in Gulf saying that his Father isa Pakistani. And our second Son shiftedto his own house claiming that his childrens would get scared by the Police. l'm awaiting when you too are goingto leave me. What's your problem ? The Girls nowadaysare interested in living alone with the family safeguardingtheir own interest. And they too have different kinda excuses for that. Everyone is havinga way to get escape. Without whom should l share the worry and pain in my heart from 10-40 years. You are the only one to support me. Should l give permission to Ashraf to fix the marriage ? Let them fix any proposal they like l'm will be glad . Anyways let the Guy they are looking for her shall be well educated . Don't just pursue after money and wealth. Hope they wouldallow our childto pursue her education. l shall bring you the medicines. By the way Abu-Bakar, Our Moosa is not yet to be seen. He is been very lucky. He had got the keeradath House so cheaply. Moosa's Father wasa close associative of keeradath House. There is no need for a Father like that, he is more than enough .... He had started talking rubbish. Hey fellow it's your daughter's wedding today. Could l stop from sayingthe truth even if it's my daughter's weddingtoday. Sainatha, why there is no Music ? l can't hear khabisha singing. Let everyone arrive .... - Everyone is eagerly waitingto listen your song. Stop flattering Brother Abubakhr. Don't tease me ... We were just talking about you. He might have said something rubbish in his gossip. Whenever l tell the truth they say that it's rubbish gossip. When he used to live at Bistimula in Mumbai, He was entitled with a nick-name as '' GossipingAbubakhr''. Due to God's blessing he retainedthe name in karachi andas well as here now. Even his Father was not badat that. Where is Vetisheri Abubakhr ? He is here... lt's his daughter's weddingtomorrow ! He isa Pakistani ! We have being orderedto arrest and depart him to Pakistan as soon as possible. Call him ! Sir, l shall come along with you tomorrow after my daughter's wedding. Please don't ruin my Daughter's Marriage. Please exempt me .... Just for a day ... l can't do anything .... lt'san epoch-making case .... l would loose myJob. What are you doing ? - You get into the Van. Sir, please don't take him away .... Let my daughter's marriage get over. No one should create a problem .... l had told you the seriousness of the matter. Abubakhr come along. - Daughter ! Please don't take him away ! Walk along .... Son of Bloody Bitches ! My God ! - Walk along .... That's the house of Abu-bakhr ... l'm not coming, you go alone. Wasn't there any Newsabout him later ? We came to know that he was in a Jail in karachi, after that he never come. There was no mail from him. And atlast we came to knew that he died in a Hospital in karachi. Mother, what is your belief ? l feels that he won't come back again. So who carried out the weddingafter that ? Moosa and rest of his friend's some how carried out the wedding. She was that Bride .... - Take the Tea ... Do you have any photo of your Father ? There might be some old one's. Let me check it out. lsn't your House name is Vetisheri ? That day didn't anyone tried to release him from the jail ? We were not able to do that. Here is the photo. Hamsa, haven't you woken up yet ! Allah ! l thought that it would be Police. Moosa Brother ... Please be seated. From past two day's he is not feeling well. Yesterday too the Police had come to visit. He was not the Police-man who usually visit's us. He wasa kind hearted person. He asked him to go somewhere else away from home when he saw him here. Hamsa, who is that Police-man ? - l think his name is krishnan. l think he is the Head-Constable. He isabout to get retired. There are good people's still living in this World. Yesterday while doing the prayer's l felt like seeing you. My feet'sare getting wounded by this continuous walkingand hiding. The Body start's itching whenever l'm exposed to Sun-light. My heart start's to beat heavily whenever l listen to the sound of any incoming Vehicle. lt's such a messy condition. l had sat here itself since l was not at all feeling well. Yesterday my elder Son Ashraf had sent some Money from Qatar. Then l thought of giving some money to you. Leave after having somethingto drink. No need... Let me reach my home before the Sun turns too hot. When did you arrive, naughty girl ? - We came last night . Father awaited you a lot yesterday. - l went to kozikhode .... Where is dad ? - He is taking bath... Come in .... Shall l serve Tea for you ? - No ... l had my breakfast just now. And Ashraf Brother had called me up. lt seems that Samira's wedding is gettingfixed. Today he may call up Mom and Dad . He hadtalked to your Father. lt'sa good proposal but it seem's that they have some condition about your Dad's issue. So you had arrived .... Now you don't need your Mom and Dad, lsn't it ? Yesterday he awaitedthis dogfor so long. Mom had started her scolding's .... l was busy ... From when did you had got so busy. Whenwe are having such a Big Bungalow ... Your wife is complainingthat she can't reside in a house where Police keep's visiting . Don't make me say more .... Mom, please stop it ... Dear you come along. l'm visiting here after takingtime-out from a busy schedule. And when we arrives you start's with complain and scolding. lt's not much year's left .... Let's leave .... You too had come ... - Grandpa, don't forget to bringthe Chocolates. Orelse l won't allow you to get in, and shall make you get caught by the Police. Don't do it... - Shall l leave .... Now are you feeling something different in particular ? Sometime l feel's bit dizziness .... My whole body isaching especially hand's ... Andtiredness ... ls he experiencing any mental disturbance now ? Mom hadtold me that a reporter is frequently visiting him and enquiringabout the past. Deny from saying it if you dislike. Get up ... lt's not because of that. She is a nice knowledgeable Girl. l'm getting tired since l'm getting older. There is nothing to worry about. Have the same medicines which you are taking now. His pressure is bit high. You must take some rest. lt's just few year's left, should l waste it by taking rest. We had been to your house ... - Ooh it was you. l thought it's some other trouble. The S.P is very strict. He had askedto observe everyone in particular. l couldn't find you last day when l came to sign. And l didn't even find anyone familiar. Give him Rs 500. l'm not having enough money in my pocket. Start the vehicle .... Who is it coming ... lt's our Moosa Brother. She is looking like ''Singer Noojhan'' ls she your new Bride ? Anyways she is really beautiful . When was the wedding ? Abdul Rahman, you please keep your mouth shut ! Come in .... Sulaika... just come out ... See who had come. lt's our Moosa and newly wedded Bride. Abdul Rahman, she isa reporter. l'm fed up of him ! He doesn't know what he is saying ! What to do . Come in .. Don't take his words seriously. She had come to see Abdul Rahman. And l'm not able to go everywhere like earlier. And she is scared to come alone. How is he ? Now the condition had gone worse. He is deprived of sleep . And he is not eating his foods properly. What is she saying ? Your Father is Crack. Does she know what is happening in this world ? Last week the Police had come to visit him. lt get's worse after their visit's. Moosa Brother l got hold of both of the personalities. lt's been so hard to findthem. - Whom ? l'm talking about that Nehru and Jinnah. l took our krishnan kutty and Aftab from karachi in front of these personalities. And askedthem could you tell us from where do they belong ? Nehru andJinnah laughed. They laughed like the Britisher's. l got angry and beat them hard. Then l askedthem again could you tell us from where do they belong ? Then they made it clear. That they belongto our Country. l have to go and see the advocate and give a petition. lt's due to the shortage of money we are not going. Will l get the Citizenship ? l enfurled so many details in front of them. l toldthem even about the beedi mending works in Bistimula. And l toldthem that l worked as Bar-tender in Mysore. And even toldthem that l workedat Mubarak Beedi manufacturing company in karachi But they didn't give it. karachi Police-mens had beaten me hard. They put me in jail so many times. So it's the government here who should give me the Citizenship. Request them that please don't send me back to karachi. Stop crying ... You come and interview Sulaika later. Shall l leave... Moosa Brother ... Moosa Brother ... l forgot to say something. l had searchedfor Sardar Vallabhai Patel alot. l heardthat he is been taken away by the ''Vishwa Hindu's'' l hadasked him to visit me when ever he comes. Citizenship ! lsn't anyone here ? There are no ladies here. Could you just open the door ? l want to enquire about something. What do you want ? - l'm from Media .... l had come to visit you on Moosa's saying. l don't care who had sent you. Not only the reporter's but even the God can't save me from here. You leave from here. Uncle Hamsa, please come outside. l want to take a Photo of your's. l want to enquire many things. lt's not to harm you. lf you have some humanity then please leave from here. l don't want to see anyone in this world. l think the rice has been boiled. He might be comingafter having the meals from there. Nadira wouldn't have allowed him to leave. ''Mother, don't you feel depressed living with a person who is always being chased by the Police.... ... and had to spent most of his time in hide-out's ?'' Our depression is not so important. But l feel upset when l think about those people who are bearing this stress. How did Grandpa baredall this severe conditions ? At first he never usedto go outside. And now he reveals somethingto me. His great depression is to die asa foreigner. He feels so proud when he say'sabout the Father's pension recievedto his Mother. Do you know all these peoples ? l do know many thing's .... But most of them are not alive now . There wasa girl named khadisha . She was one of his relative. khadisha knew how to readand write Malayalam . She knew everything along with singing and dancing. khadisha and the Groom would leave by the next Train. We would be visiting you frequently. The karachi is just nearby. He is speaking as if karachi is located in Manjeri. lsn't it , Moosa ? After khadisha had left, the song's in the weddingare not so pleasing and soothing. lt's been so many years l hadn't hearda songfrom you. C'mon singfew lines .... Moosa is crazy about khadisha's song. He always makes her sing. Her Father was too like that. Since you are leaving sing few lines to him. Cmon sing ... Yesterday there wasa mail from khadisha. l got disturbedafter readingthe letter. lt's was not like the usual letter's from her. khadisha haven't likedthat place. lt would change with course of time Most of the Grief and depression would drive away after having kids. lt's been four yearsafter her marriage. Aunty you don't get tensed about it. Now l feels that there was no needfor such kinda proposal. lt's our fate ! Everything happensaccordingto his wish. Shall l take tea for you ? No dear ... Let me leave .... Tell Moosa to come and visit me. He had gone to Manjeri , l shall inform it on his return. Let me take your leave. Ramakrishna, make sure you have the money before betting. l have been playing card's for many years, its not the first time. But you bet for higher amount's even if you don't have any money. Brother Moosa .... lsn't she the daughter of our Sainatha ? - Yes ... lts not been long you had left from here ! l left that place .... That Man married a Pakistani women from there. Did he divorced you ? No ... But he asked me to be his second wife. But my heart didn't agreed for that. l'm coming along with you to your house. l shall come soon ..... Don't hurt aunty by complainingabout unnecessary stuffs. l won't hurt anyone ..... l haven't hurted anyone till this year's. Aunt Sainam .... Dear why did you return ? Dear what had happenedto you ? Aunt you don't enquire anything now. She is tiredafter travelling. Let her take rest . Moosa what had happened ? She toldthat she had quarreled with her husband. There's something serious .... Orelse she won't have returned .... l shall post a mail to karada Abdul Rahman. He isa close friend of the Groom. Let me try if anything could be done. Son, you must do something . - Aunt you don't get worried. Don't scold her .... Shall l leave ... Daughter khadisha ... What have you decided ? To stay in the country where l was born. Orelse what can l do ? Daughter what are you saying ! l carried out your marriage by taking so much of trouble. God .... My daughter's fate had turned just like mine. Dear you go there once again. lf someone is goingto karachi from the Native, l shall send you along. l'm not going anywhere ! l'm fed up of that enclosed Gown, the tasteless food'sand a Cruel Husband .... The desire to stay with the husband had gone. Tomorrow we must go and visit Maika ... - Ok we can go ... He wouldask to work asa servant in his house. l had seen a lot. Let's go there after all they are our relatives. '' Those who are rich are his friends, and who have nothingare his labour's '' You don't worry dear .... l shall pray for your welfare. The almighty would surely show usa way. My heavenly father, please save this orphan's ! Aunt, where are you going at this early morning ? l'm visiting my younger Brother. Since he is the only relative that l have. Son, where are you going ? l'm going to Manjeri. On the way l thought of visiting you. You might be knowingthat khadisha's Visa had got expired. ln the usual case they won't allow for it. lt's not so easy for women's since they can't stay in hide-out's. l'm clueless.... And she is not at all agreeing for returningto Pakistan. By the way, Son how are you able to stay in the Country ? l'm continuing my stay by remaining in the hide-out'sand offering Bribes. Don't know when l'm goingto get caught ! What should be done so that l can stay here ? l won't return to that place even if they kill me ! lt would be too expensive if you go to court. Aunt Sainam won't be able to afford it. Would the Advocate be able to help us ? - May be, since it's his profession. May be the Police might show some pity over you since you are a women. khadisha think once again ... Nothing is going to work out since you are bearinga Pakistani passport. Enough ... This kid won't allow us to talk. - Go ... khadisha tried everything to continue the stay in the country. Didn't Moosaka helped her ? He talked to many of the advocates. Then nothing worked out. What could be done by khadisha's Mother ! lt's better we don't talk about it. Aunt Sainam, found it difficult to even earn his daily living. Where have you been ? Nothing ... Nothing .... l went to do some house hold work's in my Uncle's house. Since we have to earn our livelihood. lt's the reward or wages got from my Uncle's house. Don't cry ... Everything will be fine. l never thought that Aunt Sainam and her daughter would ever face a situation like this. Suppress it ... l don't mind doing anyJob. Atleast l got escapedfrom that Hell . Now l won't go anywhere leaving my Mother. Ask your Mom to come and visit me. -To offer some money, lsn't it ? There's no needfor that ... - khadisha l ... Don't regret for what you have said. Everyone say's it due to care and love. Shall l leave .... Come ... Come ... Drink everything ... l won't go anywhere leaving you all .... Have it ... Since you don't have to fear anyone like me . Come ... Daughter ... Police .... ! Ooh Police ! Hey don't run ! Don't try to run away from the Police. khadisha don't run orelse you would get beating's. Stop there .... Stop there ... We hadasked you to stop .... Stop there ... Where are you running ! Please don't beat me ! Please don't beat me ! Mother ! Please don't beat me ! Please don't beat my daughter ! She ran after being scared. My child isan Orphan. We are Poor ! You are having citizenship of Pakistan. Your husband and passport are from Pakistan. We are sending you back since your passport had expired. l'm not havinganyone there . My husband married some other Women. l was born and bought up here. l'm just havinga Mother. And she is here ... For God sake please allow me to stay here. No chance for that .... The Government's decision is to sent you back by tomorrow's train. Andtwo Police-mens would be accompanying you. Daughter ... My daughter ... Mother .... No one went to bid farewell to khadisha. He too was not able to go there since he was hiding from the Police. That day he was in grief. He usedto like khadisha a lot. Didn't you got anyone else to get married. How can we change our fate. You may go and sit there. There is time left for the arrival of train. Moosa is not yet to be seen. Where had he gone ? The Police is wandering here and there. Shall l serve foodfor you . lt's been too late. Mother ... Mother have you gone to sleep ? Where have you been ? You must atleast consider the condition of your wife. l went to visit Aunt Sainama. She came to knew that khadisha died in karachi. Allah.. ! How did she died ? She committed Suicide. Should visit her by tomorrow. Saina's condition had got miserable. She is not havinganyone now. Poor Women ... Mother ... lt's the Police ... You won't return to your country even on the expiry of your Visa ! This is my Country ! Aren't you the Spy from Pakistan ? Walk to Police-station. What rubbish are you talking ! He is the Son of the person who sacrifised his life for the country in front of the Britishers. Shut up ! Walk along ... Get aside .... Mother ! He always says that the sight of Ernad Railway Station scares him ! That our innocent leader andancestor's usedto be carriedfrom this station for killingthem. There soul's are wandering in that place. To prevent mishap's ! lsn't there any alternative ? We would be able to visit some different places. No one ever thought of it. Will you come again to increase our work-load ? l would come here again. lt's my country too. Who is it ? - lt's me Moosa .... Mother .. My Son ... kid is not aware of you. Since he haven't seen you. l got worried when there was no News about you for months. l tried a lot to come earlier. But l couldn't . There are many troubles . Everyone is in distress. The law'sabiding it are very strict now. Son, did you know our aunt Sainam died. She was not able to bare the grief of khadisha's death. Then she got ill.... When did she die ? - lt's been 3-4 months. She was born in such a rich family. Aunt Sainam, wasalways in distress. Take the shower ... Aunty ... What happenedafter that ? You would know that after getting married. Ok... Then also .. Please tell me. l wanna listen that. No need to listen that. l'm having work below. - Aunty ! Take rest .... The disease would leave you quickly. l'm feeling better now. How is the fever ? Father can't you take rest ! l'm not usedto take rest . ls there any News about your Elder brother ? There wasa call from him. Those who made the proposal are demanding a lot as Dowry. Tell them they can offer what they can afford. Don't give tensions to the girl by unnecessary talks. They are bit greedy. lf it was my daughter l wouldn't have ever given my daughter to these greedy peoples. Earlier the natives here won't even take proposal from that state. The people there had helped the Britisher's during the uprising of 1921 . Nowadays they don't consider that. Let's not say anything now. Let everything be done accordingto his wish. Let it happen ... Citizenship .... Passport .... Border .... They are taking away my peace of mind. Police - The Son of bitchesare not allowing me to live. What had happened now ? They frequently visit's my home , tortures andabuses me. Foolish Mens ... Now is there any Country or Passport's ? What kinda passport ? They don't know that the world had changed. Now they are imposingtwo laws by a Single ruler. What is the new law ? Secularism .... l'm scared ... Wouldthey hurt Sulaika ? For God sake please tell to the Police .... l'm not able to sleep.... l won't meet any of the leader's . Almighty .... karada, please don't cry ... You usedto be such a brave man ! Even till now it's so excitingto listen Politics from you. Cheer up ! What is there to cheer up ! The world is full of injustice ! Since there is no one to stop it. Why are you cryingAbdul Rahman ? Then what would Sulaika do ? l hadtold her to leave me. Let she marry someone else. Atleast she could live without fearingthe Police. My fate ! ln the report that we got, there is nothing mentally wrong with karad. lsn't he does spy work's for the enemies during the night time ? He is not at all sleepingat night. l'm seeing it everday how disturbed he is. For God sake please don't say anythingfalse about him. ln the intelligence report that we got it is clear that he speak's perfect Politics when you say he is Mad. The report that we got from the Delhi too reveals the same. Sir, he is really a Mental patient. Who are you ? l'm a Freelance News reporter. l had heardabout you. lt's a very Sensitive and crucial case. Don't get into trouble . lt'sa problem of Human Right's too. The News reporter spirit which tries to find Human Right's in the Pakistani Spy's.... l would put an end to that within a day ! You may leave ... Grandpa let's leave ... That S.P isan animal . Let's leave and look for some other alternative way. Don't cry ... You are very well aware of the Police-men's behaviour. Yet l thought of just giving a try. Come.. There is no use of sheding your tears in this World. He is in Mecca ... Would be arriving by tomorrow. Moosaka nothing could be done in this matter. The Party is Consisting of 2-3 M.P's ... Can't anything be done even if they wish ? There are some hinderance in this Case. karadan isa Mental Patient. You know l can't even whisper the name of our Political Party in Delhi. They are claiming that karadan isa Pakistani Spy. The leader's of our party had warned us not to even say the name of that Country ! Moosaka you can ask for any other help .... We had come to discussabout karadan's matter. l had read your articles. The one that you had written against the Financer's andthe Police. Shall we leave ... Moosaka sorry l couldn't help you. Please don't feel bad . Who is it ! Please come in ... No ... Since you were about to leave. Today there would be two strikes. So l would be very busy . You might be knowing our karadan Abdul Rahman. Yes indeed ... The Pakistani who is mentally disturbed. The Police is torturing him a lot. And his condition is getting worse. Something should be done . This is problem is out of our reach. lt'san lnternational problem. Can you do anything about it. This problem wouldturn out to be a national issue. Only the big committee could influence it. Vasu brother you must do something. lt's really miserable . Usha, you might be knowing everything. We have lots of restrictions. Even then l shall talk to my leaders. Could you call up the Police station ? No need if he calls them, then this poor fellow hadto answer in front of many peoples. l'm in a hurry... Shall l leave . Ok leave ... l thought atleast Vasu could help us. Vasu and his colleaguesare really nice guys. Just can't understand what they are saying, while deliveringthe Speech. Now what should be done ? From now onwards l won't go in front of politicians for help. l knew it earlier that they won't be able to do anything in this matter. l had come on your saying. We must visit some Advocates. lt would be bit expensive. ln the case of karadan, there is even no one to look after his matter's. Shall we meet Advocate Ramakrishnan ? He charges a lot as fee. He takesaway an appreciable amount from the money sent by my kids. l know two advocates named, Pradeep and Fazal . We can handover the case to one amongthem. They won't charge too much if their client is poor. Hand it over to Pradeep. Why not Fazal ? Nothing ... They are scared to interfere in these kinda matter's. l'm saying it due to the experience. ls it ? From when l had startedthis investigation everything is turning out to be astonishing. lt'sa crucial matter. We can try an attempt. He is miserable and poor. He is not havinganyone to even run behindthis issue. First we can give a petition to the State embesy. After that quickly we have to apply for a stay order. His disease is a strong legal point. You can handover the documents to me. l shall get it signed. We have to offer somethingto the Police so that they won't disturb him. Who is he ? Waliagath Moosa ... He is residing here with 1 to 1 year permit. He is the one who is helping this poor's . How did you got into it ? -Asa part of a project. He is having some proof and documents. You always get's into this serious kinda issues,isn't it karadan sound is not to be heard. Dear he is not here. The natives here hadtaken and locked him in a distant relatives house. He would come after two days. Did he agreed for it ? Some how they took him. He isabusing the Police. So the Police had startedto come and disturb him frequently. Please put your signature here. Take his thumb impression on it. l shall get his signature on it. - Ok .... Didn't you took karadan for any treatment ? We tried all that was possible. He wasa great knowledgeable man. He was well versed about the Politics of that time. Moosa and his friends used to get astonished by his speech. He was being severely tortured in karachi, lsn't it ? He sometime say'sabout it. By hanging upside down, the karachi Police and Military mens used to torture him a lot. He get's violent when he talks about those cruel mens. Have you decidedto stay here itself ? You were in a deep sleep. Let me go and wash my face. l think she is hailingfrom a poor family. She asked me for some starch water. And on giving she drank it . l enquiredabout his house a couple of times. She won't utter a word. And would change the topic. l went in search of your house. You won't be able to figure it out so easily. Have to work harda bit to find my house. Atleast tell us now who all are there in your family ? Mother, Brother is in Mumbai and Dad died . Didn't anyone approach you with marriage proposals ? The desired proposal had not come yet. Will you be able to pay the dowry ? - Oh yes, we are very rich . Anyhow you got born in a respected state like our's. That's why l'm not scared of anyone. This is the soil which even made the Britisher's to Shiver ! They claimedthis country asa hell. And now even their slaves are claiming the same. Who are the slaves ? Everyone expect this oldand elderly peoples. Grandpa you are sweeping from the bottom. This is not just the knowledge acquired by reading. l acquired it being with my natives. We wouldacquire knowledge when we are living in between the peoples. The food had been served. Come . l just need little ... - lt's less ... Grandpa, why didn't the thinker's like this got into power after the partition ? Even the leader's who took the initiative for partition didn't knew that the Country is getting endangered. Then what about this poor peoples .... Britain did this to trick our leader's who were greedy for getting into power. lt seems that you don't have any objection towards ''Mahatma Gandhi''. Britains trick didn't worked out in front of him. Moosaka the Cirle lnspector hadasked you to come and visit him. Ok.. l shall visit him by tomorrow. What is she doing here ? She is a news reporter. We know's it well ..... You might be tryingto find loop holes in Police. We can't stop from doing our work because of you all. Your work ! Don't act to smart .... Moosaka you don't carry this trouble maker along with you. Dear would you get into trouble ? Even l'm born in this Soil .... They won't dare to do anything ! She isa brave girl ..... Moosa Shahib the reply for your request letter had arrived. Do you know English ? Since it's our Mother tongue ... Could we refrain from learning it ! l know about 10-30 words. Your request could only be taken into consideration if you take a Pakistan Passport. So you must apply for a Pakistani Passport. From where am l going to get the Passport at thisage ? Here there are proof that you are a Pakistani citizen. And it's true that you don't have a passport along with you. The law would follow the rulesabide to it. Take your copy . ln the letter from the S.P he had again asked me to create a Pakistani passport. What should l tell to them ... You go to sleep.. We can think about it latter . lt's not like earlier ... You are getting weak . That Usha is in the next room. She want's to talk about something. She want to know about so many thing's. Sometimes l feel like laughing at her queries. She even want's to know about the relation between us. He becomes restless if l'm not near to him. While sleeping he places his hand over me to check whether l'm near to him. He say's that the sleep is with fear so he does that. lt might be due to love... You could consider it only like that. Many people had migrated from kannur, lsn't it ? ls Granpa keeping in touch with those still now ? Yes there are some contacts with them. khadisha's Husband was from Pannur. Even there were too many peoples of this kind. But most of them got perished . Nabisa and Usman were from Chakara Parambu. Ashraf is not yet to be seen. Where had he gone ? lt's been a longtime l haven't seen you. Earlier l usedto see you atleast within two weeks. Nowadays l don't move out from my house. There is no information regarding my husbands were about's. Everyone is claimingthat he is not in karachi. Then where should l search for him ? You don't worry .... He might be safe somewhere. He would surely come . Go and check it out through a Paranomist. Will he be able to tell us clearly about his where abouts ? From how long is he away from here ? lt's been a year ... And their is no information regarding him. l'm seeing the person ... He had lost his youth and grown old, lsn't it ? He isa fearful person ... Yes he fears the Police. l can see a person running with fear. The place is not clear. l'm not confident about the place where he is now. The desire to return is not at all to be seen in him. Please tell him to come at any cost. There is no sign of his return soon. Let me try . Since he hadto be brought back. There would be some expenses. Would it cost much ? - Let's try. Aren't you from his family ? Come after 2 days .. - ok. Don't worry . Let me study everything in detail. Everything would be fine . He had come atlast. ls it the Police ? karachi Police . He is very scared after returningfrom there. Nabisha tried out most of the treatment's. And she went before many priest's to cure his disease. And she had gone to each and every place. And later on his Son too turned out to be like his father, scaredand silent. Sometimes Nabisha usedto come beside usand cry. What is Nabisha's condition now ? Last year Nabisha died suddenly. She was not sufferingfrom any particular disease. She died by takingtensions. Now his Son is guardingthe Father. He feels that his Mom would come back. There'sa women in their relation. She cooks the meals for them. Mom is not here ... She would return after few days. l had come on Moosaka's saying ... Why had you come ? l had come to see Usman and his Son. l want to take some photo of their's. l had come on Moosaka's saying ... Daughter, they might have informed you about everything. l don't know what are you upto .... Usman is inside .... Close the door ! Go away .... Shut the door ! Close the door the karachi Police is comingto take me away. Shut the door ! Shut the door ...! Orelse they would take me. Shut the door ! Mom would be coming soon... Don't be scared ! Mom would be coming soon. Don't be scared ! lt's a good one ... And is havingfat. Nowadays everyone is just buying the Chicken. She had arrived with the meat ? - You hadarrived. Ooh... l'm not keen to bring meat for you. l know you are a miser from earlier. Mom, where is Dad ? - Dad had gone out. Why Dad isalways wandering with that Usha ? She was notorious from the time of college. He might be behind her at that time. You listen to her foolish words. Our Dad would get into trouble. Police have a cold war with that girl. Shamsudin Sir had askedto be precautious. They are blamingthat she is betraying the Nation. There is nothing wrong with her ... She is brave and intelligent. Guy's are jealousabout her. You both don't quarrel upon this matter. She isa kind girl. She won't get scared so easily. l saw it that day how bravely he talkedto the Police-mens. Then you both make her stay here. And so that we can marry her to you. See he is blushing. l'm not sayinganything. you will regret it later. What's wrong with him ? There won't be any difficulty in findingthe way. Anyone would show you this Bungalow. You fooled me.... Will you come to visit me if l say this was my background. You are a witty fellow ... Didn't she got any marriage proposal's ? No ... Everyone is leaving away after lookingat this house. Aguy came here with a proposal that he loves her a lot. After visiting here ... He ended up all his love and left. Love is meant for rich peoples, lsn't it ? Grandpa you sometime say's the truth. That's the attitude l like about you. You even came to know that l speaksabout the truth seldom. l would end my life if l find a person on this earth who always speaks the truth. You won't findanyone who always speaks the truth. Grandpa you told a truth one more time. Shall l serve tea for you ? - No ... l shall come later. Since Usha is our leader ! Today l visited Usha's house. When l went to Manjeri l thought of visiting her house After visiting, l regreted - Why ? She was just boasting .... What you said was right... She is hailingfrom a poor family. l think they don't even have enough to eat. l never heard of her saying about her problem's. She alway's fake's ..... Sometime she forceibly gives the auto fare. l got really surprised .... She had grown older than the age of getting married. lf it was from our family, She would have got 2-3 kidsat this time. Who would be willingto marry a girl who is not even havinga proper Job. Nothing could be offered from his family as dowry and even her Father is not alive. From my experience the late marriage's are usually successful. Something good will happen to her. From where are you coming ? You are looking so exhausted .... Your face is looking as if you have participated in a hunger strike. l hadto meet some people. So l was busy. . . l didn't got time to even have my food. l was searchingfor you. The Police is after you ... So be cautious ! lt's good if the Police are developing human values. What happenedabout karadan's Case ? - The medical reports should be submitted quickly. Andalong with that some certificates from the School too should be provided. Moosaka didtold me that he used to reada lot. Let me try ... And l shall submit the certificates soon. Where are you about to go ? l shall drop you till there. No... l'm on the way to the bus stop. C'mon pop in ... There are no brave guy's here. l must visit Gandhi and Abdul Rahman Shahib. Abdul Rahman Shahib hadtold so many times that Place won't suit us. He hadasked so many times that a Malabari couldadapt to their food. Who is going to listen ! lt's been few daysafter hisarrivals. Now there is some peace here. The Police are not visiting him for past few weeks. l had come to take the Medical certificate. And could you find any old certificates of his. l hadarranged for the Doctor's certificate. Two year's back the School where he took the education got shut down. All the proof's had been transfered to some other Office. We should get it ready from there. The advocate had told it would be better if we get that. l hope we will get that Shouldn't some fee's be given to the advocate ? He is not greedy for money. No need for it now..... So you are the one who is tryingto save us now ? Would it result in the way likeJinnah Sir triedto protect the Muslims ? Dear you don't take it seriously. Where is Moosaka ? Had be gone to get marriedagain ? What could be done other than that in the old age ! Don't you knowthat you have to come and sign in Police station between 1st and 5th day of every month. Are you trying to increase our work load ! Walk in .... Should l send notice to you ? l would lock you behindthe bars. l'm sparing you since you are an old man. l didn't do it intentionaly. l was not at all feeling well. Yesterday Dinesh Sinha Sir called me up andasked to arrest you. l settled it with so much difficulty. Are you aware of that ? Go and put your signature ... Why are you so depressed ? Why didthey pick you up ? For delayingto sign .... lt's my fault .... l didn't go since l was not feeling well. l would have taken him if you just called me up. Should we plead for help from you all at this old age. Don't you know that your father doesn't ask's for anyones help ! l didn't think about it .... l forgot about it since l was busy. lt's ok ... Why are you not sayinganything ? ln early day's l had taken so much scoldingfrom the Police. And hadtaken so much of beating's. The karachi Police had beaten me hard all night long earlier. At that time it didn't hurted me much. Anyways your mind is not as strongas before. l had grown old .... My fate is to live like a thief in my own Country till death. God, l'm not able to finda place in the Country for which my Father hadfought for ! God, lt'sall your plays ... Yesterday l dream't about Rahimka. Why are you talking like this ... Forget about Rahimka... lt's been all over .... Rahimka do you want some more water ? No need ... When did we go to sleep yesterday ? Anyhow l woke up early. l too hada sound sleep. Hamsa's wedding was Grand. Yes it was grand ! l was not at all well to attendthe wedding. l don't know how l reached here from kunnur. l thought of attending his marriage at any cost since his wasa late marriage. Please come and have your breakfast ... - Come in ... Rahimka you are not visiting here regularly. l'm not well dear. Where are your kids ? They had went to learn the Gospel. Are you facing trouble from the Police nowadays ? Now why do the Police need me ? Now no one comes to disturb me. Hope they wouldallow me to die here. l think they won't trouble you now. l heardthat there would be a War . You take care of yourself. God save us ... lt's fear in everyone's heart. Ooh it's kutan Nair ... You might have visited on the way to your paddy field. No... l had come to visit you purposely. Since you are here in the Country for long, Why can't you own some more paddy fields. l'm wishingto buy some more fields. But what's the surety on my stay here. Everything would be alright. Who is he ? - He is Rahimka ... He was with me in karachi. - Now l'm settled in my native. Our Native place can't be replaced by any other places on earth. Yes indeed ... l had come to inform you that Our krishnan Nair got expired in Delhi. l haven't seen him for years. Was he suffering from any disease. He had grown old .... And he got settled there. He loved your family a lot. l can't forget the help done by him. Because of his help l got financially well... We didn't knew what to do when Britisher's sealed Father's property. krishnan Nair used to say all the time that he gave the land considering your Father Ahmed . Son, shall l leave ... You continue with your chat. l wish l could reach there before noon. Allah, now how long l have to wait for the Bus. Why are you hurrying so much to leave. l have to go. Moosa surunder yourself. Don't beat me ... ! l shall come along with you. Hey betrayer of nation .... Go back to Pakistan. Where are you tryingto escape ? - Walk along ... Are the all document's verified ? - Yes ... You would attack the Police, lsn't it ? Damodhar be cautious. Take him along with handcuff's. These Pakistani citizens triedto stay in the limits of Manjeri Police station without any proper valid documents. They should be expelledfrom lndia immediately. lt is been decided that they should be sent back to Pakistan. Do you have anything to say ? Please consider my condition. Rahimka don't get depressed. Will l get saved from this trouble ? Be patient ... Don't worry. lsn't it Moosa ? l couldn't recognise you ... You had grown Old ... lt's been year's you had gone from here. Your fate is really miserable. - lt's been many year's ... l was not able to return even after trying for longtime. l usedto hear it from peoples. l rarely comes here... Now l'm staying with my daughter in Tirur. l saw Ameena once ... She hada hardtime. Nothing is in our hand. You too have changed a lot. How is Meenakshi amma ? She died ... And l'm remainingasa burden on the Earth. You don't go anywhere .. Stay along with your kids. l too have decided the same. Ahmed's Son won't go anywhere. Our native place have changeda lot. Now everyone is getting emigratedto Gulf. Malayalee's fate is to leave his native place all the time. Shall l leave, l'm feeling tired. You move on.. l can't walk too fast. l shall come to your house after two days. God... Look at the fate of Ahmed's son. Law which doesn't allow's him to reside in his own Motherland. Such a bad world ... l thought you won't return. And l know you are not a person who would wait for too long. This time it got too late. lt got late because l decided not to return after coming back. Do you have your Visa ? l'm not having Visa nor my passport. l destroyed the passport. l decided whether l could return to my Motherland without having both of them. That was bit dangerous. Anyways you are very courageous. What have you decided to do now. l had come to discussabout that. Please show me a way. Do you have any enemies here ? No ... Then let's do one thing .... Limit your visit to outside. Now l won't go back at any cost. l'm fed up and l am old now. Do what is necessary l shall visit you sometimes. Anyways the Police is not arresting you on your wish. Remain in hide-out'sas longas possible. Take care that no one betray's you. Andthe Police is of our state ... They too are in need of money. Our Native place had changeda lot. Yes it had changed. After that he didn't go anywhere. He lived hiding in his own Motherland. Atlast the court too favoured him. Didn't he hadany contact's with karachi afterwards. He was having some business there. He had come after selling the shop in karachi. Andafter that l haven't even seen his Passport. The Passport is the cause of every problem. lf we wanna stay there then we should bear the passport of that state. And it is even required while coming to their own Motherland. While creatingthe passport he too might have never thought of the trouble. What had happenedto Sahib ? Aren't you taking care of him properly. lt's due to her over caring nature. For 2-3 days l was not able to sleep properly. He is getting worried about unnecessary stuffs. Don't worry ... The pressure is low ... You can get discharged by tomorrow. How far your article and investigation had reached ? Are you feeling better ? Doctor said he isalright now. From where are you coming now ? l came to visit you when l heard that you are not well. You would be happy on next week after the Summit get's over. lt would be benificary. We had seen these kinda Summit a lot Grandpa you are having fever. - Ooh is it... Are you a Doctor ? We can consult you to the Doctor after Uncle's arrival. Who told you that your Uncle is going to arrive ? Mother and Grandma told me so. They even told that their would be a wedding here after hisarrival. Would you buy me new clothes, Grandpa ? Sure.. Wearing new clothes you could go along with the Bride. We can send one more reminder to them. Anyways if anything is goingto happen it would occur after the end of this new Summit. Usually it arrives by this time. The Police isawaiting for it. Body and mind both had got weakend. lt's been 1 7 years you are continuing your stay here. And 6 years without getting into the sight of anyone. And rest year'salong with this permit. You would get surely get the grant to stay here. Nowaday's the back stabbing is more. Back stabbing is not good for the progress in Politics. lt is been done by those from the same party. Our Rahimka was too betrayed by this Politics. This is being done by those who had helped in the Partition. The court session would begin now. lsn't your Visa is goingto get expired ? You haven't shown your documents yet. lt would get ready ... May be after this Summit . Anyways it shouldn't be a trouble for us. Rauf would come come to your house. Send me little more .... Since the expenditure is high nowadays. Let me try. Hold it ... You go and play dear .... - Ooh our Native place is so beautiful. You are saying it because you have not stayed here before. The Police does come here to catch our Garndpa. We all get's scared ... Will they even catch us if we stay here. The Police is catching our Grandpa because he isa Pakistani. They would even catch us .... Since we are his Grand childrens. That's why Mom decidedto take us to her house. Grandpa doesn't fear anything . Those who had come from Gulf are scared of everything. l would complain it to Grandpa ... - You go and Complain, l don't care..... Grandpa they all are afraid that they would get caught by the Police. Go inside ... Dear you go inside. My opinion is that too many peoples shouldn't be invited. That's your wish but must provide a tasty meal for the guest's. We could organise the Henna Ceremony in the Hall . - No ... We can carry out it in the house. l think it would be better if we organise it in the house of my Wife. Where are you ? Where are you ? l'm right here ... What are you doingat this late night ? l got scared ... l wasn't able to sleep. Our kids had grown big ... And had got really big .... Then how would be able to sleep, lsn't it ? Leave it ... There might be some problem . That's why he might have taken a decision like that. l had raised him with so care and Love. No he doesn't needanyone. He can't even spent a night with his parents. He is busy with the thought of howto make the marriage Grand. lt may be because of that he had decidedto carry out the Henna ceremony too in his Wife house. Will you attend the ceremony ? That ceremony is meant for Women and Childrens. The needfor people like me is just in the wedding. l won't attenda Henna Ceremony without you. What is going to happen with all this ? - You try for some other Job . lf l publish thisarticles may be l would get a Job in their Newspaper. How long are you going to run behind this problem ? You are not even getting proper sleep. The Police and Politicans would come behind me if thisarticle get's published. You don't worry about that.
