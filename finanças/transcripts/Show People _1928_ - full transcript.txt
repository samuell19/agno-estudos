Billy Boone... a custard pie artist from the slapstick "lots". de esos de 'tartas en la cara', . As a Southern colonel your make-up is very Indiana. Father, who is this coarse person? One has to come to Hollywood to meet such common people. Aw, boloney... and you're slicing it too thick. Say, are you punks trying to crash into the movies? My daughter, suh, is considering a few offers. My acting is talk of Savannah. My acting is the scandal of Hollywood. Crashing the movies is no cinch... but I thing I can help you. What'll you have for dessert? They've got the swellest cocoanut cake today. Isn't he wonderful! The Comet Studio, where serious comedians went through the daily grind though of "getting laughs". Where's the dame you were going to bring out? She'll be here, all right... you couldn't keep her away. Gee, Dad... won't they be thrilled back home when they see me as a great dramatic actress? Stage 4, Lot 5... turn to hour right as you enter the left wing and keep going. Are you Mr. Comet? If you don't say yes I'll kill myself. I'm Miss Pepper, the new actress.

I shall always give my public best that's in me. When I call just come in and show mid surprise, like this... Remember, the one law of the pictures is, don't anticipate! Now we'll rehearse it. Is that all I do? Until the jolt. Then just take it natural... don't anticipate! Don't get camera-shy, Baby, and you're a cinch. I didn't think they made them that green! Baby, you did that like a real trouper. I came here to do drama. Why didn't you tell me it was this? Bat, Baby, all the stars have had to take it on the chin... Swanson, Daniels, Lloyd... all of them. Come on, Baby... you've gone this far... it'll be easy from now on. She did that so nifty we'll take it again... in a close up.

I've backed you to win, Baby... show them I'm right. You're great on water stuff... I'm gonna get you a lot of it. Go ahead. I'll take it on the chin. The preview... that trying ordeal when a new picture is tired out before Mr. and Mrs. Audience. Don't anticipate! What's the matter, Baby? Don't you know you're a wow? That girl's got real personality. I'll have Billy Boone bring her over tomorrow. I can't keep it from you any longer... I'm the director. Come on. Let's get out front and hear what they have to say. What do you want to see a punk drama for? Come on. That's the kind acting I'm gonna do some day. That's real art! Don't be sil. Make them laugh and you make them happy. I tell you, Mr. Chaplin... that girl is a find. Will you please sign my album? I'm crazy about signatures. Who is that little guy? That guy is casting director for High Arts Studio. Bring me a nice big piece of custard pie. Why, I'd be afraid I'd throw it at someone. The thrill that seldom comes... a call to the High Arts Studio! Lew Cody and Elinor Glyn. She writes a lot of those IT stories. I like Mr. Cody... he has such an open face. Maybe Mr. Morton will only see you... and not me. I Won't sign up unless he takes you, too. You want Miss Pepper also, don't you? I want Miss Pepper only. I won't sign up unless he takes you, too, Billy. Oh, that's all right. I can take it on the chin Nothing for you now, Billy. Maybe next year. A contract from the "big studio" and the thought of leaving her old friends... brought to Peggy mingled emotions of gladness and sadness. Goodbye, Jim... I'll always think kindly of you for giving me a chance. I hate to see you go, Peggy... but I knew I'd make something of you. I'm all through, Billy. You mean you're just beginning. It's going to be hard... working without you, Billy. But we'll see a lot of each other, won't we? Yes, but it Won't be the same. It's all in game, Baby. I guess it's the crossroads... your path leads one way and mine another. Then I won't go! "You're going to be a big success, Baby... and I'm going to watch every step of your career. At the High Arts Studio preliminary test were being made for Peggy's first drama. That's Marion Davies. Mr. Telfair, I want you to meet Miss Pepper, your new leading lady. I understand you're quite popular also. You're at the Countess De Fray's reception. Yoy look over there and see the man you hate... Then you look over there and see the man you love. The man you love! The man you hate! It is six months later. You have just received a letter that your lover is dying. I know there's nothing written on it, but read it anyway. Your lover is dying... suffer. Give me tears! Tears... please! Would you please ask them to play "Heats and Flowers"? Louder... and sadder! Tears... tears... please, Miss Pepper, if you have any respect for me, give me tears! That's no way to let a lover die! Imagine your poor old father starving to death. You don't know my father! Can't you do something to bring tears? Imagine forty thousand starving Armenians... Now that we've got her going... no film in the camera! Imagine you're very much in love with someone... you're at the crossroads of your lives... Just once more... a big yelp! That's what I call good commercial crying. Stop crying! Stop it, I say... we've got a big laughing scene to do! Everybody go to lunch. Now that you have graduated from cheap comedy, you must forget it... You must acquire new personality... a superior manner... new friends... I will be glad to introduce you to the elite of Hollywood. Confidentially, I am Andre d'Bergerac, le Comte d'Avignon... And so plain Peggy Pepper acquired the manner of the "elite"... and became known as Patricia Pepoire... My paper is SO anxious to have a true story of your past... When I first came on a movie lot I thought a pie was... Miss Pepoire is fatigued. With her permission I will speak for her. First, allow me to inform you that Miss Pepoire is a direct descendant of General Robert E. Lee. This is going to make a splendid story. Being a lady of quality, she chose the cinema as a medium of self-expression. She has the temperament of Nazimova, the appeal of Garbo, the sweetness of Pickford, and the lure of Pola Negri! Hold it! Hold it! Don't move! My being in the picture will help get it in the big magazines. While Billy struggled on the same old way. Let's have Peggy come over and have chow with us... Peggy's too busy these days... I seldom get a chance to see her. I'll bet if ask her she'll come. Miss Pepoire won't be able to see you tonight. She has important business to them to. We haven't seen each other for so long... I was wondering if you'd come over and have dinner... like we used to? I'm sorry, but I have another engagement. You're not going out with your leading man, are you? It's all part of work... won't you please try to understand? Sure I understand. I'll see you some other time, eh? No one realized Patricia Pepoire's importance more than Peggy Pepper. I'm terribly, terribly sorry if I kept you waiting. Waiting is such sweet sorrow where you are concerned, dear lady. Today we're going to do the kidnapping and rescue stuff. Is it necessary that it be done so roughly? ...one thrust of his sword, and he takes you in his arms. Ten thousand dollars or your life! Another troupe on location. Now we'll take it once more. Better beat it... Miss Pepoire's nerves ain't right today. Miss Pepoire, will you please freshen your make-up? ...we're still making them, but the old troupe sure misses you. Baby... it's a kick to see you doing so good. Why, Peggy... surely success hasn't gone to the bean! Of course not! Don't be absurd. I knew you were only clowning. Same old Peggy... anything for a laugh. I wish you would please refrain from using slag. Oh, for crying out loud! Patricia, they are ready for the next scene. Andre, this is Billy Boone... I used to know him in the old days. Why, Andy used to serve me spaghetti down at Tony's. How can you be so insulting! Gee, Baby, I'll bet you miss the laughs we used to have! I never miss lowness, cheapness and vulgarity. ...but I suppose you'll always be the same... a cheap clown. Would that I had the right to protect you... always. Come on, Billy... forget the sob squad and jump off that rock. Studio lunch... at the stars' table. The boss wants you to come up to his office right away. I'm having my luncheon. He says you'll have lots of time for lunch after he gets though talking to you. Pardon me, Doug... just another one of those boring conferences. Read these... Miss "Patricia Pepoire".

Sarah Bernhardt! "Pati Pepper, when I first signed you, you were human... regular... full of ambition... You're not on the level with the public that made you... and from now on I want to see the real Peggy Pepper in the screen. I'll give you one last chance to change... and I want your answer now. If you'll pardon me, Mr. Morton, I shall finish my luncheon. These producers are so disturbing... to one's equilibrium. They don't appreciate what a great artist you are. You are so understanding! SCREEN ROMANCE Wedding oh Patricia Pepoire and Andre d'Bergerac, le Comte d'Avignon, to be solemnized today. The wedding promises to be one of the most outstanding social events of the season and will be attended by many screen notables. Just think, Patricia, you'll be a real countess. It must be wonderful to be in love! Sorry, but I can't admit you unless you have an invitation. I must see her right away! You tell her I've got to see her... and I don't mean maybe. Pardon my depravity... but that terrible comedian person is downstairs. You don't realize what you're doing! I do not know what I'm doing, and I won't have you interfering in my affairs. "You've ruined your career... just when you were becoming so successful. ...and now you're going to marry a man you don't care a rap for... just for a phoney title. I'm not pleading for myself... it's for your own happiness. Think a minute... remember the old days. I don't want to remember the old days. I'm going to bring you to your senses... now! Don't worry... everything is quite all right. You were right! I'm all you said I was... just a clumsy fool! Look at yourself! Look at me! We're only fakes... just clowns! He was the only real person... and now I've lost him! But, Patricia... our wedding! There will be no wedding! Don't talk to me... Don't touch med!... You... you... pie-face!!! Peggy's trip "down to earth" had brought a clearer view of things worth while. Peggy, I hope you were right in recommending this new leading man... but can he really act? He's marvelous, Mr. Vidor... and we work together so well. Don't tell him I'm in the picture. Just start the scene... I want to surprise him. Mr. Vidor, I want to thank you for giving me this chance. It's up to you, Billy... and don't let enlarge your hatband. You boys have been separated from your outfit... and make for this village... The camera's going... you can't quit now. Take them on the chin... it's all in the game.
