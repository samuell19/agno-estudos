Mr. Tsui , you laundered $500M for Director Zhao. How much was your commission? That's a trade secret. 20%? That's a bit steep. In the U.S. they charge 25%. One thing about me, nothing ever goes wrong . The money. . . Wherever it's from , after we're done with it, will be squeaky clean . Give it a try. Lau Po-keung. Congratulations on becoming a Chief Inspector! Thank you, Sir! Here at JFIU, Joint Financial Intelligence Unit, our main objective is Anti-Money Laundering. Each year, over $3T USD are laundered around the world. We received a tip about a huge amount coming our way. Keep your eyes peeled. Don't let these criminals get away with it. Yes, Sir! Miss, please kill the engine. Show me your I . D. and pop the trunk. Thank you. 96728 calling Control. Bravo-481 6359 Please open it. Let me. . . Okay! Chief Luk! What's the number? Cell phone number. 1 52 1 50 44662 Okay! Thanks! Leung! Orange BMW, plate UW91 80. Copy! Kwun Tong. "Tsui Yau-choi is not your only choice" You run a big business in the Philippines? Whatever makes money. Am I right? The new President is cracking down on dope. . . No fucking bullshit, pal! One month, $20M in USD. Yes or no? The amount is not an issue. Yes or no? Piece of cake. You're a piece of shit! Don't waste my time. If you have no say, take me to your Boss. We checked out firearms for this operation. Be careful! Yes, Sir! I made you coffee. What's the story? Claims to be a dope dealer in the Philippines. Can't tell if he's lying. Repeat after me. "Last week, 2 Chinese dope dealers were killed." "You know them?" - Sir? - Miss? How are you feeling? Are you okay? Call 999! Chief Luk We blew it! Those two were my brothers. Chan and Wong. "It broke my heart." Are you testing me? If this is Manila, you'd be dead. Just shooting the breezze. I'll stop if you don't like it. The deal is off. Bring him over. Mr. Lau! The Boss wants to see you. Action! Cel 2/F. . . Standby. Watch out! What? Damn it! You're a cop! What? Police! Freezze! ICAC ! "Independent Commission Against Corruption" Drop your weapons! Damn! Stop ! Don't move! Hey, that's my car! Inspector Lau! Chief Luk from ICAC sent over some files. We're ready for the briefing. Thanks! ICAC is after a Customs officer taking bribes. Inspector Lau is after a money laundering cartel. Tsui Yau-choi probably paid Dik Wai-kit to let cars through Customs without proper checks. Tsui Yau-choi is the mastermind. The unregistered phone used to contact Dik Wai-kit probably belongs to Tsui Yau-choi . Zhao Mei-xin, came here a year ago under the Capital Investment Entrant Scheme has a mysterious background . Zhao Mei-xin is not our target. Bribery and corruption is not our concern. Money laundering is not our concern. But If we find Tsui Yau-choi and Zhao Mei-xin, we can bust this money laundering outfit. Dik Wai-kit and Tsui Yau-choi are the targets. Get to work! Yes, Sir! Mr. Tsui , your turn. It's a piece of cake. Just $1 0M in RMB will be done in a jiffy. Mr. Lam, Inspector Lau from JFIU is here to see you . Okay! Please come this way. It' okay. Be patient. We'll get it done. Mr. Lam just stepped away. Mr. Lam! It's Mr. Lam. . . "Private number" Hello, 999? This is Inspector Cindy Lee of JFI U . Hello ? We're in the back stairs of New Development Bank in Central. We have a man with a head injury. Please send an ambulance. Forget it ! Be patient. It's okay. Don't worry, we'll get this done. No, you can't. Who are you? What the hell? Hello, Miss Zhao. Wong Hoi-wo, I'm your new partner. No! Okay, get to work! Your $1 0M is now squeaky clean. We kept 15% as commission. Much cheaper than Tsui Yau-choi . Besides, no one else in Hong Kong can take your order now. Think about it. Thank you. The Boss wants you to lay low in the Philippines. You know your way around . The new Boss is much nicer. That son of a bitch Tsui Yau-choi hung me out to dry and won't pay me. ICAC can't trace this phone. I'll be in touch. Please come in. Thanks. Mr. Yau? Yes? Thanks. For my ear. Did you report Hanson Lam? Yes. That's right. Can you tell us what happened? I'm with the bank's anti-money laundering department. Recently, I noticed some accounts had unusual transactions and found out those were Mr. Lam's accounts. That's why I decided to call it in . I didn't expect Mr. Lam would . . . We need you to come in to give a statement. No problem. William ! Auntie! I'm here to bother you again. Auntie, you finished your fruits. I'll buy some later. No need, Han will do that. The air con is new, turn the fan away from you or you'll get sick. Oh, I forgot. . . - I need to pay you . - No need . . . I'll sort it out with Raymond . Are you hungry? I'll cook you something to eat. No need. But I'm hungry. Hey. . . Are you busy lately? Doing what? Oh, I forgot. . . You can't say. I go cook now, this won't take long. Hey, William. Raymond . How's my Mom? What a coincidence. I just saw her. She's doing great. Thanks. Give me your account number. I'll pay you for the air con. Don't bother. Consider it my room and board back when I was in the U. K. Tell you what. . . Treat me dinner when you're back. I saw a flat online for $1 2M . I want to buy it for my Mom . That's great! Since my CPA license is recognizzed in Hong Kong. Sorry, I have another call. Call you later. Sure. Bye! Hello? Chief Luk! We got something. Keep the money safe. After I settle down in the Philippines, I'll manage you to get there. What about that Eva? Is she going with you? We split up eons ago. Why bring that up? I was at the doctor's this morning. I'm pregnant. 6 weeks already. If it's a boy, I'll teach him boxing. If it's a girl, you can teach her to cook and pick up guys. She'll be a heartbreaker. Don't worry. You have to go alone. Take Care. You too. Luk Chi Lim. Chief Luk! This is Dik Wai-kit. How can I help you? I want to turn myself in and be the state witness. I gave Zhao Mei-xin's contact to the new Boss. He wants to take over Tsui Yau-choi's outfit. If you guarantee I won't go to jail, I'll tell you everything. That's up to the Department of Justice. If your information is useful, we can plead your case. Meet me in an hour in Deep Water Bay. Give me your cell number. 9465 4808 Tammy Yes, Sir! Just after this turn. "Almost there" "In Repulse Bay" Repulse Bay? This is Deep Water Bay. I'll go take a look. Be careful. "Repulse Bay" "Calling. . .Tammy" Where's Chief Sir? He. . . How is she, Doctor? She suffered a heavy blow to the head. We found blood stasis in her brain. The next 72 hours is most crucial. If it goes away, she'll be fine. Will she be in any danger? We'll do our best. Thank you. Tsui Yau-choi is missing. Dik Wai-kit has disappeared . We hit a dead end . What can we do? Just now in Deep Water Bay, if I got out instead of Tammy, would I be sitting here? You never know. Just like darts, everyone wants to hit the bull's eye. But few people can actually do it. Except me. . . Have a drink. Kenny Senior Luk, You want to see me? Why did you put Mark and Derek on my tail? Senior Luk let's talk somewhere else. Yes, Sir! Have a seat. Senior Luk, you never sat on the other side. The view is quite different, right? Relax! Just a few questions. Let's have a chat. Have you been to Macau lately? No. Investments in real estate or stocks? No. Any offshore accounts? Side business? No. Cut to the chase. Why is there a file on me? On July 1 5, $1 2M went into your account. Can you explain that? I knew nothing about it. How is that possible? Why didn't anyone give me $1 2M? I don't know. Senior Luk, my account number, except for a few companies for auto transfer, even my Mom doesn't know about it. Don't try to tell me your new cell phone provider gave you a $1 2M rebate. I only gave the account number to a friend. His name is Raymond Chan. He's an old classmate. He emigrated to the U . K. for over 20 years. Last week, he called me. Chief Luk speaking, I'm out and about running to the bank. Give me your account number. I want to pay you for the air con. I told you no need. For my job, if I take $3,000 from you, I need to write a report to my Boss. Forget the money. Look. . .what if something happens to my Mom and she needs surgery. It'll cost tens of thousands. I can't let you pay for it. We should be clear on money. Give me your account number. Are you telling me other than Raymond Chan, you did not give anyone your account number? Yes! He told you he wanted to pay you for the air con? Is that it? Yes! The guy is dead . I have bad news. On July 1 4, Raymond Chan was in a car accident. He was dead on the spot. The money went into your account on July 1 5 But Raymond Chan died on July 1 4. Unless he transferred the money from Hell. We checked your phone log. 3 days before and after July 1 4, there were no calls from the U. K. It's $1 2M ! Where did it come from? Senior Luk? You started a file on me because someone reported me. You won't tell me who it was or why they did it because you must interrogate me and spot the weakpoint in my statement. Raymond Chan, his death is the biggest giveaway. You think I'll make such a mistake? You wish to discuss interrogation technique? Great! From the Dunning-Kruger Effect, another conclusion is drawn. Two types of people are extremely confident. Type A, those who are ignorant. Type B, those who are arrogant. Which one are you? A or B? At least tell me which day? July 1 6. Did you check up on the informer? Worry about yourself first. Are you so hard up for cash? The Principal Investigator of ICAC worth $1 2M only? The acronym ICAC can't be that cheap. I'm not on the take. There must be a reason behind this. I need you to check it out. I need to know the truth. Maybe the truth is. . . the person cracking down on corruption is actually corrupted. Very well! Think it over. Figure out how you can help yourself. Well, Senior Luk? Anything to add? No. Okay! You're in luck. We spoke to the Department of Justice, what we have is not enough to press charges. But this is a letter of suspension signed by the Director of Investigation. While you're on suspension, you're not allowed to follow all your cases, log onto the ICAC computer, or enter the ICAC building until further notice. If there's any new development, we will call you in for questioning at any time. For the time being, you're not allowed to leave Hong Kong. We need you to surrender your pass and your ICAC cell phone. Mark, Derek, escort him back to the office to pack his things. This way, Chief Luk! Carry on! Cel, come inside. I need you to follow up on some files. Gentlemen, please wait over here. Go down to reception and see if I have a DHL package. Okay! Get to work! "Cel: Eva Ng is the only one who sees the Internal Investigation on 7/1 6" It's Luk Chi Lim. Can you check someone for me? I'll send it to you now. "To: William" William I forgot your phone number. Raymond is dead. When you see this note, I have gone to the U. K. Don't worry about me. Hey, kid! Don't touch that. Are you okay, Teddy? Mommy's here. Look at Mommy. It's okay, look at Mommy. It's okay, kid . Calm down. . . Listen to this. . . yes Calm down. . . Breathe. . . Thomson. . . Come on. . . Quiet. . . Let's calm down. Listen to the music and concentrate. Let's listen to the music. Breathe. . . Yes, just like that. Thank you. . . - You're welcome. - He is okay. Poor kid. How can I help you? Well. I need to check my account. All transactions for the past 2 weeks. No problem. I'm sorry, Mr. Luk. Your account has been frozzen. I can't log in. Thank you. Hello! Eva Ng Ng Chung-wah is a model and part-time online bidder. You're in luck. She has a prior for theft record . That's why she's in the system . Her address and phone number I'll send that to you later. Thanks. - Thanks. - Be careful! Hey, Chicken! Weren't you in Thailand? Landed a last minute job. Need to finish that first. It's a new client. He's in Room 3. Thank you. Hello! Eva? Yes. What kind of pose do you want? I brought a lot of clothes. I'm new at this. Why don't you tell me about yourself? As a warm up? Okay! The clock starts ticking. No problem. My name is Eva. I study in Cambridge in the U .S. In the U.S.? Haven't you hear that? It's famous. I came back because my Grandma is sick. How sweet! Of course! I'm a blue blood. I charge you $3,000 an hour only. That's cheap. You must know a lot of people from work. Quite. Accountants, doctors and lawyers. Including. . . Brother Fatt. But don't tell anyone. Really? You ask so many questions. Are you a reporter? Butt out and get lost! Bitch! I gave you a flight ticket. What are you doing here? Come with me. Let go! Get her! Let me go! Help! Let go! Get in! - Over there! - Help! Over there! Come back. . . Stop! You can drop me off here. Did you report me to the ICAC? I'm Luk Chi Lim. Of course not! I really don't know anything. I didn't mean it. I really don't know anything. I didn't do it on purpose. Hey! Watch it! Thank you. Why did you report me? I borrowed money from a loan company. When the interests start adding up, Fat Fook came to me. Hi , Brother Fook. Hi ! About the money, I will pay you back. Just give me another. . . 2 or 3 weeks. Don't bother if it's so difficult. Brother Fook, don't toy with me. I will pay you back. . . But not in 2 weeks. 2 days, okay? I said, don't bother. Won't you do me the honor? Then I won't. I won't pay you back. If I pay you back, I'll be struck by thunder. Don't forget. You'll be hit by thunder if you pay. Turned out Fat Fook wanted me to report you. He said you took $1 2M from Dik Wai-kit to let him get away. He must have known I dated Dik Wai-kit. That's why he came to me. Right? That's why ICAC would believe me. How stupid of me! Where is Dik Wai-kit? How would I know? We split up a few months ago. Did you know that creep is married? Take me to Fat Fook. Help! Let me go! Get in the car ! Help! Luk Chi Lim harassed the witness. That's the evidence. Bring him in. Let him explain. If we do that, we're using ICAC's reputation to cover up for him . I suggest we go by the book. Sir! Thank you, Sir! Director Yu signed the warrant. Mark, Derek wait for Luk Chi Lim by his flat. Janet get the paperwork to tap his phone. Yue, take Luk Chi Lim' s picture and do a survey in the neighborhood . Understood? Yes, Sir! Hey! Go to the Jockey Club, deposit some money into my account. Yes, Boss! Brother Fook! Someone wants to talk to you . Fork used to work for me. - Inspector Lau! - Cindy Hello! What's the scoop? This afternoon, there was a serious car accident in Sai Kung. Crashed into the mountain and caught fire. Two bodies were found inside. Tsui Yau-choi and Ho Tai-sing. Accident? We're looking into it. We're waiting for the autopsy report. What's the word around town? 8 words Out for blood. Run like a headless chicken. What does that mean? Tsui Yau-choi's thugs are convinced he was murdered. They want blood. But can't find any obvious suspects. Nobody has a clue. Something else is rather fishy. When Tsui Yau-choi first started out, he was under Kwai Hing. Inspector Lau, he's someone you should know. They say Kwai Hing has a stake in Tsui Yau-choi's business. Yet after what happened, Kwai Hing gang's are awfully quiet. Way too quiet. Uncle Kwai-hing! Long time no see! Should you be eating that much sugar? Who cares? I'm in my 80s. I'll eat it whenever I can . No wonder even though Tsui Yau-choi is dead you're not exactly heart broken . It was an accident. Nobody expected it. Get off it! It was no accident. Who did it? That's your job to find out. Someone you can't afford to piss off? Tsui Yau-choi started out with you. You had high hopes for him and he took care of you. He cut you a share in his business. Look what happened to him. Christ! I'm eating! Let me. . . Have some tea. Look at this one. He can't rest in peace. I heard. . . Strictly hearsay. . . A gangster recently returned from the Netherlands. He is rich and powerful, callous and ruthless. They say he's interested in Choi's business. But I don't know much details. I'm in my 80s, I'm content with having my daily dessert, No more triad vendettas. Grandma left me this house. I meant to make more money so I can buy you a better place. But I was useless. You couldn't wait. Dik Wai-kit was quite sweet at first. He offered to give me his money. I was thrilled , of course. I could save up enough to buy a new flat. Then I found out, he opened an account under my name to hide his bribe money. It was my fault. I fall in love too easily. And I trusted him wholeheartedly. Am I really stupid or what? No one can predict the future. But life goes on. Take good care of yourself, and your Grandma won't have to worry. Sorry, you'll have to sleep on the sofa. Thanks. Good night! No wonder Hong Kong is safe. It's late, but Police officers are still at work. Do I know you? Inspector Lau . My name is Hong Liang. Director of the Anti-Corruption Bureau . I notified your superiors. Now I want a word with you. "Urgent! Come back in!" It's quite alright. It was rather ad hoc. I only decided this morning. Have a seat. How can I help you? Here's the deal. . . We're on a case that involves a Vice Ministerial level cadre and bribe money in the billions. While tracking the money we find out he intends to launder the money through Hong Kong. That's why we need to liaise with JFI U . How can we help? Our investigation shows his mistress is acting as the go-between. And his mistress is currently in Hong Kong. Her name is Zhao Mei-xin . Chief Luk is innocent. Trust me. Ms. Ng, you came over here to change your statement. When exactly are you telling us the truth? I know I lied last time. But Chief Luk is truly innocent. You can't arrest him. Okay, we'll look into it. You don't believe me? Perjury will land you in jail. Of course I believe you're not lying. Jail? Sorry! Forget what I said. Actually, we want to help Chief Luk. We will look into it. Really? So you believe me? Pretend you didn't hear anything and I was never here. Okay? I better go. Thank you! Bye! Chief Luk! You made contact! OCTB "Organizzed Crime and Triad Bureau" is looking for you and so is ICAC. You're sizzzzling. What have you been up to? Look up someone for me. Fat Fook in Yuen Long. He works for a loan company. That's all I know. You're off the hook. I told Chief Ching everything. He believed me. What is it? What's wrong? Police business! We're on a case too! What are you doing? You have the right to remain silent. Everything you say may be used against you in a Court of law. Follow me. Get in! Follow them. Yes, Sir! Asshole! You lied to me. You said everything is squared away! Answer me! Hold her off! - Miss! - Liar! Let go! Let go of me! Inspector Lau, what you did is out of line. Not really. Chief Ching, here at JFIU , we always go by the book. Luk Chi Lim is a suspect wanted by the ICAC. Please hand him over. I can't. Because Luk Chi Lim is also our suspect. He has committed a very serious and complicated crime of money laundering. This is something hard to explain It'll take a while to take his statement. I know you and Luk Chi Lim are friends. You're just trying to cover up for him. Is it necessary? I know you and Luk Chi Lim are colleagues. Must you treat him like a murderer? Is it necessary? Those of us at the ICAC simply loathe investigating a member of the Disciplined Services. But we can't help it. We're guarding the tailgate of Hong Kong's rule of law. Group L "Internal investigation" is guarding the tailgate of tailgates. It's a dirty job. But someone had to do it. I know ICAC's Group L investigates their own staff and it's known to go by the book. You complain about your dirty job, of guarding the tailgate of tailgates. But to me, you seem to enjoy it and are proud of it. Just like cleaning the toilet is a dirty job, but that doesn't mean those who clean it cannot be proud of it and find it quite satisfying. Really? I'll let you get back to clean the toilet. - See yourself out. - You can keep him for 48 hours tops. Thanks for telling me. I didn't know I have that much of time. You're welcome. We'll be back. Take turns and watch them round the clock. Yes, Sir! Sir! Chief Luk Have some coffee. I made it myself. It can't be that bad . Has it been 48 hours? It's dangerous out there for you. You're wanted by both sides of the law. I dare say, the safest place in Hong Kong is right here. I have the dirt on Fat Fook. His real name is Yeung Ching-fook. Triad background. Basically, a punk. How did you piss him off? I don't even know him. But he sent someone to report me. I don't think someone with triad background would mess with an ICAC investigator. He's just a stooge. I checked his loan company. The owner is Wong Hoi-wo, a Dutch Chinese, and is consistent with our Intel. Highly suspicious. What have you heard? Dik Wai-kit told me a new player wants to replace Tsui Yau-choi . Everything fits. If Wong Hoi-wo is the new player, when you went after Dik Wai-kit, you have become a threat. So he ordered someone to report you. But this Wong Hoi-wo is very mysterious. I checked his business registration, the address is a secretarial service. The trail went dead. Don't be disheartened . We have another lead . Zhao Mei-xin. The ACBB in China gave us her name. They're your counterpart in the Mainland . This case is not just your case, but mine as well. I'll keep an eye on it. Please behave and get some rest in here. When we prove you're innocent, You can have abalone. . . Lafite. . . and . . . Let me go. Our coffee is much better than the ICACs'. Thank you. We're on a tight schedule. What can you do? Do you know playing soccer how can you get a sure win? Which is the referee is on your team. Keep talking. I'll introduce you to an anti-money laundering expert. Roger that. Inspector Lau, Fat Fook has disappeared. We're looking for him . The CCTV from Customs is ready. Miss, please kill the engine, your I . D. card and pop the trunk. Zoom it in . That's a limited edition handbag. You can rest assured while I'm around, nothing goes wrong. Here he is. Let me introduce you. Miss Zhao, my brother Thomson. Yau Chi-sun . Hello! We have met. Have we? Oh! It's you! That's right. Thomson's old boss at the bank was helping Tsui Yau-choi . But he died recently, that's why he's now in charge. So Miss Zhao, how much are we talking about? "1 0 billion" Excellent. 2 months. . . for other people. I only need 3 days. Great! In that case, I'll let you meet Mr. Zhang, you can tell him your plan. Perfect! Okay! Here's to us! Cheers! Hong Kong only has 3 quotas for this limited edition. These are the credit card receipts. Zhao Mei-xin. Call the card center and monitor the card. Here's the delivery! We got something. Autopsy report said Hanson Lam died of a broken neck. But further tests showed red paint in his hair at the back of his head that matched the fire extinguisher on the 26/F. On the fire extinguisher, we found samples of Hanson Lam's hair. We have reasons to believe Hanson Lam was attacked from behind , he fell down the stairs broke his neck and died . There's a mole inside the bank. I have someone in mind. Is Mr. Yau around? He's on leave till next month. Thanks! Thomson lost his parents when he was young. He's autistic. His senses are 5 times more sensitive. The tiniest sound or images can provoke him. Once he suffered an attack at the orphanage, he spun out of control and pierced his eardrums. He's deaf in one ear and only has 30% hearing left in the other. You have been his doctor all along? He's very smart, but has deviant behavior and shows a propensity for violence. You have something to show me? That's why we arranged for him to learn martial arts so he can let off some steam. It's the focus of his treatment. Are you kidding? I lose again? I'll drink up. Brother Fook! Mama-San! I'm glad you're here. You're late. Don't you have to work? Bring in the ladies for my boys. I want those who don't mind groping or action on the spot. You look happy, what's going on? Never mind that. The Boss is taking me on his gambling ship tomorrow. Must be a big deal. That's great! You must celebrate. Send the girls in . Okay. . . Pretty chicks, not the fat one. Fat Fook is going on the ship. Okay? Okay! Miss Zhao, please wait. Miss Zhao, I'm sorry, the car you booked will be a bit late. Here. . . Here's your card. Fine! Thanks. Inspector Lau, this is the card center. Zhao Mei-xin just swiped her card. Copy that, thanks! Admiralty Hotel, Lets go! Take care. Sign here. Inspector Lau, Chief Luk is leaving. Stall him . I can't. It's been 48 hours. He knows the law too well. Senior Luk! Are you talking to me? How flattering. What's up? Hello! Asshole! Chief Luk, you don't need help? I'll be in touch. Be careful. Don't! Keep this pace. Inspector Lau, this is Hong Liang. Zhang Peng the suspect just left Shenzzhen by boat. He's probably going to Hong Kong. For now, we can't tail him . If you spot him , let me know right away. Okay! Roger! Brother Fook! Mr. Wong wants to see you. Mr. Zhang, this is Mr. Wong. Mr. Zhang. Welcome aboard . Hello! Thanks for coming . Let's go inside. This way, please. Okay! I'm very excited to have Mr. Zhang here. Welcome! Cheers! How can you launder my $1 0B? Good! Let's get down to business. Mr. Zhang, please have a look. Here. . . is a cheque for $500M Consider it your winnings on the ship. It's clean . Win money without betting? Interesting. What else? Here. . . we have different ways to launder your money. Buying and selling of jewelry, antique auction, luxury property, phony transactions. We have several hundred local and overseas bank accounts for telegraphic transfers. Together, they can launder $7B. What about the remaining $3B? Tomorrow, a new stock will be listed . We have a placement of a billion shares for you, Mr. Zhang. The face value is $1 00M . When the market opens, I'll push the stock price up from 1 0 cents to over $3. Then your $1 00M will become $3B. Mei-xin told me ICAC is giving her trouble. Can you fix that? Here's the deal. . . Mr. Zhang, don't worry. I spent $1 2M and took care of him. He's suspended . He can't touch the case. Look. . . what if My Mother needs surgery suddenly. It'll cost money. I can't let you pay for it. Give me your account number. I bet that asshole would never find out it was me who nailed him . Mr. Wong, you have an interesting friend. You're too kind. He's just a brat. Or like we say in Cantonese, he's just the messenger. Messenger? Laundering $1 0B in 3 days for Mr. Zhang takes a genius. Good! l like him. He's bright. You have his contact? - Sure! - Good! Come, Mr. Zhang! A toast to us. Cheers! I'll be waiting for the good news. Definitely! We won't let you down. I'm leaving them with you - to give you a hand. - Thanks! - I'll walk you down . - Thanks! Take care. What's this? Look! Lok, go that way. This way. Well? Here! The restaurant. There he is! That way!
