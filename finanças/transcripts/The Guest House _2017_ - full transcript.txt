- Hey, what's your name? - Jeff. That's a great name, my dad's name. Hey, why is this club not in your bag? - What's your name? - Anthony. Hey that's my son's name, great name. What's your name? - Patik. - Patik, good name. One question, why is this club not in your bag? It's okay, Shank, ring it up. You got it, baby. No, I can't afford it. I never committed to buying it. Alright, scratch that off, how many do I got today? Almost had him, though. Manana. Hey, Shank? Let's go get a beer. Dude, I'm strapped. Hey, it's on me, no problem. You sure? Here you go, guys. - Thanks, bro. - Hey, thanks. Hey Shank, how 'bout I crash at your place for a little bit? Oh, shit, see I knew there was a reason why your cheap ass wanted to get me a beer. Damn. What happened this time, bro? Hey, man, I don't wanna get into it. Good, 'cause I don't wanna hear it, bro. Alright, so here's what happened. Last Saturday, Paula decides to throw a Survivor party for one of her co-workers. What's a Survivor party? Like a CBS or something? No, it's five years cancer free, dummy. But if you ask me, that whole concept is fucked, because what happens after the party if the cancer comes back in two months? Right, why jinx it? Yeah, so... Did you just agree with me? I've been knowing you five years, you've never agreed with me once, Shank. Yeah, yeah, yeah, well this time, I do. You don't see the Lakers trying to throw a parade before the All Star break, do ya? Yeah, that's right. Anyway, and you want to talk about a pathetic crew, alright, check this out. First it was some 90 year old beanbag, who you had to say everything five times before he gave you an answer. How's it going old timer? - How you doin'? - What? - How you doing? - What? How you doing? Then, she had a friend Alice, who's kind of cool, I mean, I like her. But Alice had to bring her artistic kid, um... Autistic, not artistic. They don't do art. Okay, alright, whatever, but let's just say this kid didn't have the best table manners. And then to make things worse, she's gotta invite her lesbo sister, who has to bring her girlfriend. I mean, you think I want that around my daughter? I mean, it's bad enough that Sam's gotta be hangin' around Jen's daughter Allie 24/7. What's wrong with Allie? I mean, no, Allie's cool, but, I think she might have inherited her mom's gay gene. Gay gene? Yeah, you know, that happens. No, bro, it don't happen. You're a jag off. Alright, whatever. So now, I'm supposed to be entertaining these losers on my day off, when the Laker game's on, Kobe's on a major heater, I mean he's going for like 60. I mean fuck that, right? Now you can imagine what happened when the party was over. The way that you talked to my sister, the way that you talked to my friends, I am sick of it. Oh, you're gonna walk away right now? How dare you. But, I left so quickly, I forgot my cellphone. So what'd she find? Who cares what she found? I mean, it's not important, she found what she found. No, no, no, don't give me that, bro, you either were cheating or you weren't. Define cheating, man. You, you're the definition of cheating. What's wrong? Next thing you know, the drama queen, she starts yelling at Sam, "call 911, call 911." What? They arrest you? No. They said I just had to bounce, but then this one cock suckin' prick actually talks her into filing a restraining order against me. So Shank, can I move in? Just for a little bit? Uh, hell to the no. You think I want you shady ass staying with me, bro? You gotta be out of your mind, dog. Okay, it's cool. Hey, thanks for the beers, taco. See, dog, you're a jag, bro, how do you even know I got money? Damn, dude. If we can't get Mickelson to commit, we're gonna have to go straight to the Golf Channel. Okay. See what their offer is. PGA deadline is three months away, so that gives us little time for him... Excuse me. Jake, wait outside. Oh. Yeah. Boyfriend, friend... Hey, what was all that about? Just the future of our company. This is my concern, not yours, come on. Well that's why they pay you the six figures, right? More like six cents. Eight sales? That's not too good for my number one guy. Oh, come on, I had a bad day. I mean, I got something on my mind. Anything you want to talk about? This is no time to go into the crapper, trust me on that. No, no, no, everything's fine. Alright, get out of here. Sammy. Is that your dad? No. Okay, well, we gotta go. Alright? - Bye guys. - Bye. - Bye. - Bye. - See ya. - Bye. - Hey. - Let's go. Look Sam, I know she's your mom, and she told you to call the police, but you know, you didn't have to. I mean, couldn't you see that I wasn't hitting her? I mean, in fact I was actually holding her arms to keep from hitting me. You were bullying her. You're a bully, dad. You bully her, grandma, and me, and you're ruining the family, and that's why I hate you. Oh, you hate me? Here, I got some lunch for you here if you're hungry. Great dad. A cold burger and stale fries. Good job. Where are we going anyway? We're checking out this new place we might be moving into. We? You mean you. I live with mom. Yeah, I know you do, but if this works out, you're gonna be spending weekends there with me, and some school nights, too. Oh, no I'm not. Uh, yes you are, Sam. Well we'll see about that. Yeah, we will see. You wanna check it out? Alright. You have fun. Everything's new, all the amenities work, there's a washer and dryer, which you're welcome to, but the pool and Jacuzzi's off limits, sorry. It's pretty much what you see. Nice. You know, I travel from time to time, I'm gonna need someone to look after my dog, that's if you don't mind. No, it's not a problem at all. Dad? Oh, excuse me. Yeah? What's wrong, honey? I'm sorry. Oh, me too, too, honey. I love you. Come on, it's okay. Hey Max, this is my daughter, Samantha. - Hi, Samantha. - Hi. I like your house. Thank you, very nice meeting you. I know, isn't this cool? I mean he's got this whole Mexican, Tijuana theme. Real classy, huh? Dad, you mean Spanish style? And this house is nothing like that. A pool? That's cool. Oh no, that's off limits to us. I'm sure we can work something out. Hey, you guys wanna meet my dog? Be careful, she's very intimidating. Oh. Come here, you. Come here. Okay, I'm gonna need to do a credit check. Three references? Okay, I'm gonna need a cashier's check, first and last, and that's non-negotiable. Oh, of course, no problem. Yeah, what's up? Yeah, I'm sorry to bother you, but you said this place comes with full amenities, right? Uh, yeah. But the cable's out. I mean, what is the deal with that? Well, the deal is you call the cable guy and order it. Oh, okay, I was just getting pumped up for the big Laker game. Um, do you know any good sports bars around here? Yeah, there's a few down Ventura. Ventura... Uh, any good ones that you know about? I mean, I don't know this area very well. Okay, yeah, alright. I'll find one. I'm sorry. Sorry to bother you. Jake? Yeah? You can watch the game here if you'd like. Are you sure? Yeah, sure. - Come on in. - Okay. Hey, you want a beer? Oh, yeah, sure. Here you go. Oh, thanks. - Take a seat. - Oh, okay. Yes, did I tell you he was gonna do it? Kobe, Kobe, Kobe. Hey, how many points did he get, 50? Well he did take 50 shots. Oh, get out of here. Hey, you want another beer? Uh, yeah, sure. But you know what, I'm gettin' a little hungry. Do you want to order a pizza or somethin'? No, I was gonna put some ribeyes on the grill. I mean, that's if you're okay with that. Hey, that's gonna work, too, man. Max, don't get me wrong, I mean, I love Paula, I really do, she's a good girl. But the truth is, I just didn't wanna marry her. Not even for your daughter's sake? Oh no, come on, fuck that. I mean, that's exactly what my parents did. I mean, they stayed together just for the kids' sake, and that was 15 miserable, disgusting years, and in the end you just end up paying vaginamony, so, no, it's not for me. Yeah, after what my ex Stacey put me through, I'm taking a break from relationships myself. Damn, what were you, a pro athlete or somethin'? Sort of. Made the 2004 Olympics for the decathlons, I was favored to win the gold. But I tore my hamstring. Oh, that sucks. Hey 20 bucks in the shot? Bet. Man, how do you afford all this? Made a lot of money in real estate. I gotta tell you, Max, and I wanna give you a heads up here, I'm gonna be pullin' a lot of hot bitches. Okay, well, we'll see, we'll see. I earned this, didn't I? Man, I think I'm headin' in. Hey, Superbowl's this Sunday, what do you think about throwing a little pool party? Uh, yeah, cool. Catch you later, man. Hey, you know what, I appreciate you paying for all this. I mean, I'll take care of you in a couple of weeks. Plus the back rent. Yeah, don't sweat it, but you're cleaning up afterwards. Alright, gentlemen, if you're gonna get in this Superbowl party, you're gonna have to pay up. 100 from you, and 100 from you, let's go. Hey, can you cover me? I don't have anything. I'm sorry. I'll get you later. Hey, dad. See the new iPhone Maxwell gave me? Oh, yeah, I just got the new iPhone, it was useless to me. Then why didn't you give it to me, then? I'm just kidding, honey. Well now that I have the iPod and the iPhone, all I need is the iPad. You're up next, dad. My birthday's next month. Yeah, maybe for your graduation, if your grades improve. Well can I at least get some tickets to the Justin Bieber concert? Please? Sam, you're such a Belieber. I am not. Yeah, Allie's right. What is up with you and Justin Bieber? Bieber doesn't care about you. Dad, what's up with you and Kobe? Kobe doesn't care about you. She's got a point there. Come on, let's go to the TV. See. There are winners, and then there are losers. Sorry, bro. This is not so bad. You know I can't stand him... I'll get the girls. Looks like Jake's found a home. Hey, while Max is getting the girls, do you want something to eat? Are you sure? We've got a ton of food here. No, Jake, we don't want anything. Hey, mom. Hey. Hey. Where's Allie? She's in the car. Oh alright, let's go. Bye, dad. Bye, Max. Max, why should I feel bad? I mean, all she ever did was complain. "Jake, what do you watch so much sports for?" "Jake, why are you always drinking so much?" "Jake, why don't you go for a promotion?" I mean, it's like living with my mom all over again, you know? How long was you with her? What? 14 years? Think about it. There's a reason you never married her. You knew all along she wasn't the one. It took me a long time to realize that Stacey wasn't the one for me... Oh shit, hold on. I owe that guy over there three grand, I think he just saw me, too. Why you owe him money? Some bullshit golf bet. Oh... Man, just fuck him, he's a hustler, man. Go on, what were you saying? Yeah, let's not talk about Stacey anymore. That's long gone. Come on, let's drink up. Hey, come on, one more before we go, huh? Yeah, but I'ma go drain the lizard first. Jake? Jake. Is that you? Hey. How you doin'? Hey Abe, how you been? Good man, how you doin'? I'm alright. Refresh my memory, alright? What the heck happened? What do you mean what happened? We were playing a little golf, remember? At the club, havin' a good time, enjoying it, you lose a little bet, five grand, ouch, but then you don't call me anymore? No, no more love? And then you do that little Houdini abra cadabra trick. What was that about? Well to be honest, Abe, I kind of felt funny about this whole thing. Funny? Why, 'cause you told me that you said you were six handicap, right? I am, I am. Okay, but then we get out there and you're like hitting every shot in the book, you're playing like fucking Tiger Woods. Oh no, that's so wrong. No I'm not, and I even spoke to McGee who knows him, he said you're a scratch golfer. Come on, you hustled me. That's bullshit and you know it. Now listen, and be honest, okay? This doesn't have to get ugly or anything like that, but if you win that bet, do you collect? Yes you do, alright, so respect me and do the same thing, be a man. Don't sit here having your little shots like a big shot, with your big guy in the bathroom. You're like a little fucking girl, alright? Show some character, show some balls. Now that's my money you're fuckin' playin' with. Max, Max, Max. Who do you think you are? You don't talk to my buddy like that. I'll break your motherfuckin' neck, you understand? - Max, let him go. - Yeah. Max, Max, calm down, Max, Max. Hey, what's the matter with you? I'll see you again. Let's get out of here. Max, I'm fucked man, I got a DUI. I get another, I'm 60 days mandatory in jail. I'm sorry, man. Hey, I don't know how to thank you. Oh, Jake, great news. I talked to my attorney, he said the DA's got a real weak case since the cops never saw me drive the car. Man, that's great. Yeah, he said it's most likely gonna get dropped. Where you goin'? I'm gonna pick up Sammy, and then we're gonna have some lunch. Come on, you wanna roll with us? Sure. When are we leaving for Palm Springs? Uh, tomorrow morning, real early, honey. I'll be right back, I have to use the restroom. Be careful. You're going to Palm Springs? Yeah, with Sam and Paula. I don't understand, just the other night you were saying Paula never gives you your freedom and how much happier you were on your own. Hey, I know, but come on, man, I'm getting drunk every night, I'm picking up prostitutes, almost got me a DUI, we had a bar fight the other night. I mean I'm getting too old for this shit, Max. I'm surprised she's agreeing to this. Well we've actually been talking a lot lately. I mean, if it hasn't worked in all this time, what makes you think it's gonna work now? You know, I gotta try, I still love her. Maxwell, you're coming to my birthday party next month, right? Of course, I got your present all picked out. You okay, Sam? Yeah. Let's get out of here. Yeah, I'm finished. Alright, let's go. Come on, Max. No you guys take off, I got some things to take care of, I got it. Yeah. Maybe. Excuse me, sir. I'll call you back, I'll call you back. Yeah? Did you see your smoke was bothering that little girl? What is it with you Americans and your cigarette smoke? You act as if you are so concerned about your health, and yet you are a country of fat pigs. So now, you know what? Move along. You're bothering me. I'll call you back, I'll call you back. Yeah? Yeah, you know, I've been feeling really out of control lately. Yeah, I find it hard to control my anger. Have you been taking your medication? Yes. Well, you know, maybe we need to increase the dosage, huh? Or maybe I just need to get laid. Hey, you, where you goin'? Hey, how are ya? - Let me get that. - Thank you. You look good. Come here, I wanna talk to you. You know how you say I never took trips seriously, and I never planned anything? But that is now over, that's, I'm a new man. And to prove it, I've actually typed up an action packed itinerary for the entire weekend. What? I see a lot of golf and poker here. Well no there's more, read on, I mean, there's a lot more. Look, there's dinner at Ballini's, got a little spa treatment for you, and, um, what's that? The Mountain Sky Rail. Actually I'm impressed. Wait, so, how are you gonna have time to do all these things if you're playing golf and poker? I'm not, that's what you guys are gonna be doin' while I'm doin' my thing. What? Well honey, come on, you know the club championship is next week and I gotta practice for that, and then, you know, there's a poker tournament here. I figure if I win that, that's gonna take care of some of money problems, you know what I mean? So, this is your idea of working on our relationship? Fitting us in for a few lousy dinners? What's... Hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait, what's your idea of... Seriously? You wanna hold me hostage, and I gotta get my hair and nails done with you guys? Did he just say that? Come on. Come on Paula. Let's go, out of the car, please. Nice job. You suck. Paula, come on. Is someone here? What are you talking about? The lights just went out. Grab your shit. Oh my god, what's up your ass? Just get the fuck out of here. That's what's up your ass. Go. Jake. I thought that was your van. When did you get back? Uh, late last night, man. You know, I had a big fight with Paula. This whole thing didn't work out. Sorry. I hope the music didn't keep you up, I had a few friends over last night. Oh no, I mean, I was so exhausted, you know, I just crashed right away. Oh. Hey you know what, I got a tee time to make, I'm runnin' late, I'll catch you later, buddy. Jake, don't worry. I'm not gonna say I told you so. Jake. How was golf? I played like shit man. Oh, hey, the big game's tonight, you gonna swing by? Uh, you know what, I got a couple of things to take of, I'll get back to you in a little bit. Okay. Well first I thought it was a girl because of the long black hair, but then when he turned around, I was like "holy shit, it's a dude." Yeah, I'm telling you, this guy had like a fuckin' mini van between his legs. Hey Shank, I'll call you back. Hey, Jake. I was wondering if you can give me a ride to the drug store to pick up my medication. Oh, is there a problem with your car? I mean, you can borrow my van if you want. Oh, no, no, it's just that I've been drinkin' and considerin' what happened, I don't think I should be driving with alcohol in my system. Alright, I'll just grab the keys, let's go. Jake, sorry it took so long, but, there was this fag that put in like eight prescriptions. Yeah, I could've swore he was checkin' me out, kept lookin' down at my package. Can you believe that shit? What in the fuck is this world coming to with all this fag shit? Jake? Can I ask you a question? You think all gays should be castrated... Alright, enough, Max, alright. I saw, okay, I fuckin' saw. You saw? Yeah, I fuckin' saw. And? What do you mean and? I mean if anyone should be explaining themselves, it's you. You're the one who lied and made up this phantom relationship about Stacey. I don't owe you an explanation. And it's none of your goddamned business. And as far as Stacey, Stacey exists. So... What are you sayin', you're a bisexual? No, Stacey's a guy. You were datin' a guy named Stacey? Yeah. Alright. Yeah, I just wanna know if we're still cool, 'cause your friendship and Sam means a lot to me. I mean come on, Max, you know, I gamble, I drink, I pick up whores, I mean, come on, who am I to judge anyone? Yeah, we're cool. Well how did you think he'd react? Like a friend, like a human being. I didn't think he'd treat me like I had fuckin' leprosy. Oh come on, Max, well don't you think you're overreacting just a little bit? No. I don't think so. You were rejected by your foster parents. Naturally you're gonna be highly sensitive at the very first sight of any abandonment. I mean come on, you threw Jake a major, major curve ball. Don't you think he might need a little time to adjust? Are you falling in love with Jake? No. We're just friends. We became really close, and I became close to his daughter, Sam, that's it. It just felt good being around... Like a family? I'm so sorry, it's time to stop. You know what, I'm gonna write you a prescription, it's gonna be a new one, okay? And I think this is really gonna help with your anger and your depression. Hey honey, what are you doin'? Getting ready to go over to Allie's. I'm staying over tonight. On a school night? Why? 'Cause mom's going to dinner with a friend. Which friend? Um, I don't know, she's just going to dinner with a friend. You know what? That's them. I gotta go, bye. Sam, which friend? Come in. Hey, Jake. I catch you at an okay time? Yeah, sure, have a seat. Check it out. Tickets to the Justin Bieber concert this Saturday night, thought Sam would really like them. Oh, but there's four of them. Yeah, Sam take a friend, you know, we hang out at the bar and, you know, catch a game. Wow, I mean, thanks a lot, you know, she's gonna be thrilled. Alright, well, yeah, I'll talk to you later. See you buddy. Wait a second, what are you saying, man? You're gonna punish Sam and not let her go because you're homophobic? Hey, Shank, call it what you want, but I am not comfortable with her being around this guy. Why? Why? 'Cause of his lifestyle. I mean he's fuckin' dudes in the pool. I mean seriously, who knows what else he's into. Shank, these guys are into a lot of deviant shit, and it's my job to protect her. Protect her from what man? What are you implyin', because he's gay, he's, like, some kind of pedophile or somethin'? Maybe. I mean, I don't know. Do you? Dude, you're ridiculous, bro. Besides, he's gay, what do you got to worry about? Sam's a girl. Come on, Shank, just drop it alright? I'm her father, I know what I'm doin', so, I don't really have to justify this to you. So what are you gonna do? Not hang around with the dude because he's gay? Hey, that's pretty impressive. Thanks. Used to take it pretty seriously, I had a lot of amateur fights. Boxing? And kick boxing. You know what, I forgot that Sam has plans to go to Santa Barbara to see her grandmother this weekend, so, gonna have to pass on these Justin Bieber tickets. Yeah, I mean, I tried to switch it up but her grandma had this whole weekend planned, so... No problem. Keep hittin', man, lookin' good! So, you never told me, the other night, which girlfriend did mom have dinner with? I didn't say it was a girlfriend. Dad, if you wanna know if mom went on a date, just ask. I mean, that's not what I'm doin', I mean, I could care less. Okay, was it a date or not? I'm not sayin'. Hey guys, how's it goin'? What happened to Santa Barbara? Oh, her grandma got sick, we had to cancel. Well why didn't you call me? Sam could've still gone to the Justin Bieber concert. Oh, uh, it happened so fast, I figured you got rid of those tickets already. Good news, I still got 'em. We can all go to the concert if you'd like. I mean, that's if you guys still wanna go. Oh you know what, we'd love to, but actually we're just finishing dinner and we're supposed to, you know... Okay. Alright well it looks like you already made plans. I'll catch up with you guys later. Alright, yeah, sorry. Other plans? I can't believe you took me to go see Yogi Bear instead of the Justin Bieber concert. Can you at least tell me why? There's a few things about Max that you don't know about. Like what, Jake? The fuck are you doing here? Dad. I was fixin' the sink in the bathroom like you asked. You couldn't give me a little heads up here? I figured you were out and, I was about to leave this note at the front door. My apologies. Nice going, dad. Max, Max, Max, what are you doing? The fuck are you doing? The fuck are you doing man? Take it easy, take it easy. I thought you was trying to fuckin' drown me, man. No, man, you passed out. You alright? What happened? I'm sorry, man, it must've been the medication. Yeah, it made me drowsy. Come on, man, go inside. You gotta get some rest, come on. Jake, thanks for stopping by. - Can I get you a drink? - No. Jake, can I be straight with you? Sure. Tonight... Tonight I tried to kill myself. What, why? My life is a disaster. Max, if anyone's life's a disaster, it's mine. No. You have Sam and Paula, people that love you. What do I have? A big house. And... And I'm in love with someone that thinks I'm a disease. Wait a minute, you never told me you were in love. With who? Come on Jake, you're a smart guy. Isn't it obvious who? Oh come on, you can't be in love with me, I'm not gay. Come on, stop fuckin' around here. It's not like I'm trying to hit on you, I just wanted to let you know why I tried to kill myself. Come on Max, this is ridiculous, okay? I mean, you got a great life. I mean, you got a lot to live for. You got this big house... What's in the use in having a big house when you have no one to share it with? It gets lonely. You know Max, I don't know what to say, I mean, I think maybe you should talk to a therapist. Yeah, well, I tried that. You know, I talk to my therapist, all she wants to do is pump me up with antidepressants. It doesn't help. There's no drug for loneliness. You know what, I shouldn't be burdening you with all this. You know, these are my problems, not yours. I mean, you know, I... I don't know what to day, and you know, I don't know how to help you. A hug would be nice. Okay, okay, okay, that's enough. What, what? Just get the fuck out of here. Now. All I wanna know if I can just like move in for just like a couple weeks, alright? I mean come on that all I'm askin' Dude, it's not like I wouldn't let you stay a few nights and shit but, come on man, it's not like the house is on fire. Oh trust me, this house is on fire. So you told Paula? I mean I had to. I mean, I didn't want to, but Sam told her about all the tension. And what was her reaction? I mean, what was I thinkin', Shank? I had this great family and I fucked it all up. For what? So I could relive my 20s? You know what, man? Don't be so hard on yourself. You got somethin' that other people don't have. You got this huge black dude waitin' at home and he loves you, man. Yeah, but this shit is funny, man. This is the funniest shit I've ever heard. So what do we got here? Well when's the last time you put oil in? 'Cause it is bone dry. It's frozen. You're not too smart, are you? Hey, Syl. What up, Jake? Uh, he just left for the airport. Probably be better for you after what happened with the van. Oh yeah, fuckin' Shank, I told him 10 times, I said, "hey, check the oil," but that guy does not listen to me. Shank said it was your fault. Yeah, well who do you believe? No comment. Hey Sylv, what's up with Peterson position? Have you heard anything about it? Um, yeah, they interviewed last week. I think Ray told me they picked someone. Already? Yeah. Shit. Don't tell me you were thinking of applying? Well yeah, I kind of thought maybe I could chance. Well ask Ray, I mean, you could probably still catch him in the parking lot. Nah, it's probably too late, but anyway thanks, have a good one. I'll see ya. Good luck. Ray, Ray, I need to talk to ya. Walk with me, what's up? Sylvia said you found a replacement for Peterson already? Oh yes, a bright young kid out of Stanford, you'll like him, he's a good golfer. Yeah, but it's not official, right, contracts have not been signed. No, not yet. So how about me? How 'bout you what? For Peterson's job. Are yous serious? Yeah, what do you think? I think you can't even remember to put oil in the van. I could never trust you in a corporate role. Come on Ray, I'm serious here. I wanna be considered. Jake, the job's not for you, you're more of a sneakers and shorts kind of guy, not a suited and booted kind of guy. Besides, it's too late. I'll call you when I get back. Take care of that van. What are we dating here? Ray, I need this job. Jake, the company's in real trouble. I got two big account I desperately need to close. If I were to hire you, I'd really be putting my neck on the line. You mean the way I put my neck on the line for you when I testified for you at your sexual harassment trial? Why would you bring that up? You were only telling the truth. Did I Ray, did I really? Oh fuck you, and fuck her. Okay, Ray, Ray, calm down. Listen, listen. I could help you sell those accounts. I will help you close. I mean, you always said I was a great salesman. Hey, you once told me I could sell sand to an Arab. Goddammit, Jake, I know you can sell, but can you show up on time? Can you make this job your number one priority? Can I rely on you? Ray, I can do the job. Then why don't I believe you? Hello? Anybody there? Hey, Jake, I left your door open so I wouldn't surprise you like last time. I thought you said you finished off the bathroom the other night? I didn't say that. Okay well it's actually good you're here 'cause there's something I want to talk to you about. I'm gonna be moving out, Max. Why would you wanna do something like that? You know, I don't really wanna get into it, I just think it's best for everything, everybody. But I want you to know, I really appreciated everything you've done for me, and everything you've done for Sam, I truly do. Okay, no problem. But you do know you owe me $2,600 back rent, right? Yeah, I mean I haven't forgotten that and I plan on getting that all back to you, but you know, it might just take me a month or two, okay? I'll hold on to this until you pay me my money. Come on Max, I need that for my new job. Then take it from me. You get it back when I get paid. Hey. I got some post dated checks for you here. Oh, Max, but if it's okay, I really do need that laptop for work. Thanks, Max. You know what, I kind of feel bad how things, you know, happened between us and everything. Go fuck yourself. You know I appreciate this, you're a good buddy. Don't worry about it man, it's all good. Hey babe. Look. Hi. Jake's here. Hang on dude, I'll be right back. You got the numbers? Yes I do. Well, well, well, look at Jake looking all handsome in his monkey suit. And almost on time. Lose the tie. You get a chance to go over everything? Yeah, cover to cover. Good, let me show you what we're up against, alright? Our technology is the best but as you can see, our problem is we're getting our asses handed to us by the big boys. Man Ray, I had no idea it was this bad. Ah, I gotta take this. Greedy bitch. Oh, I'm sorry, I was just waitin' for Ray, I could leave if you want. Why would I want you to leave your own office? Shoot, I wanted this to be in place before you arrived. I'm Annie Grace, I'll be your assistant. Oh, I'm Jake Roth. I've seen you here, around. Yes, can I get you coffee or water? That's okay, I have a couple of sodas in the car that I was about to get. That's not necessary, I'll bring you one. What? New car. New job, new clothes. I'm impressed. I'm not buying it, but, I'm impressed. Cool car, dad. So how are the reports coming along, huh? Oh they're good man, they'll be ready in a few days. Not a few days, today. Just do it. Yes, Annie? There's someone here to see you named Maxwell Foster. Should I send him in? Can I send him in? Yes, yes, yes, send him in, send him in. Come on in. Hey, Jake. Uh, you're not here about those post dated checks, are you? They should have cleared by now. Oh, no, no, they're cleared, thanks. I'm just in the area and I was hoping if you had time, you know, we could talk. Sure, have a seat. Looks like they gave you your own office, nice. Yeah it's nice, but man, it is very stressful. So what could I do for you? I'm here to apologize. No, that's not necessary... No, no, no, let me finish. I was going through a lot of personal shit and I laid it all out on you, and that wasn't right, and I truly, truly wanna apologize for the way I acted. It's okay, it's water under the bridge. The truth is, I am who I am, and you are who you are. That's cool. And that's not gonna change. I just wanna know if we could still be friends. You know, the way it used to be. Catch a game, grab a beer, you know the way things used to be. What do you think? You know sometimes people just aren't meant for each other. Like, hey, take a bad marriage for example. You could have two people who completely love each other but yet they can't be together. Now why is that? Because they just, they're too different. And I'm kind of afraid that maybe you and I are just a little too different, so, I mean, have you ever thought about that? Considered that, Max? Jake, you're a good salesman and all, but, what you just tried to sell me is some bullshit, and we both know it. We got a lot in common until you found out everything. You're right. You are right and, you're right. There's no reason we can't be friends. Alright, well, you know, let's grab some happy hour later this week. Oh, well you know what, things are really hectic at work, so just let it calm down a little bit and I will call you, but I gotta get back to work, so, I appreciate you coming by. Alright, sounds good. Alright. Jake, it was real nice seein' ya. I spoke with him this... Hang on one second. Ray, I've set up a strategy meeting for next week. I want to hear your presentation. We'll be ready. I want you to meet Jack Roth here, took over for Peterson. Alright, nice to meet you. Look, it's gonna be on Monday, so bring your A game, Ray. Sounds good. Jake here is quite a good golfer. He was a runner up at Las Canya last year. Really? That's a very challenging course. You know, Freddie Couples helped design that course. Yeah, I know Freddie very well. I've actually played a few rounds with him. That's impressive. Well hey, set up a meeting with boom boom. Hey, you know, that's a good idea. Yeah, I know. - Good seein' ya, Ray. - Yeah, take care. No, it's fine. You don't know Couples do you? Of course not, how would I know him? Jake. Maxwell Foster's on hold. No, no, no, no, don't wanna talk to him. I'm sorry, he's in a meeting. Hey buddy, what's up, it's Max. I know you've been busy, but it's taco Tuesday, so let's meet up, no excuses. See you tonight. Have you considered calling the police? What? Sometimes these problems don't go away on their own. Oh, no, no, it's nothing like that, trust me. Oh, good. And I'm sorry if I spoke out of place. No, it's okay. Well what do you think? Rain's gonna make a break for the left. Yeah, trust me. Roxy! Get out of there, Roxy! What did I tell you about messing with that peanut butter? I'm sorry, Roxy. I just went over the numbers and they're way off. Did you bother using a calculator or were you too busy playing golf? Ray, if you just... Don't. Morning everyone, thank you for being here and putting on your fancy outfits. I see even Ray here bothered to shave. I have something to share with you before we get started. As you know, Powerbuilt has always been on the cutting edge of technology. No, go get Jake. Hey, don't tell me what you want me to do. Go get fuckin' Jake now, I need to talk to Jake. Where's Jake? Would someone tell me what's going on here? I think that's Jake's friend. And Jake does? What are you doing here, man? I'm gonna get fired. Hey, you don't give a fuck about me, so I don't give a fuck about your job. Now why in the fuck did you waste my time saying you wanted to be my friend when you knew damn well you had no intention. You didn't even have the balls to tell me to my face. Max, put it... Shut the fuck up. That's not why I'm here, anyway. I'm here for a reason, and if you would've had the decency to return my call, I wouldn't be here. Okay, well what are you doing here? What do you want? The DUI, Jake, the DUI. I thought they dropped it. The DA's being as asshole. He won't drop it, and this is my second DUI in 10 years. I'm looking at 90 days in jail. Oh shit, I had no idea. But the good news is, I have my star witness, someone that could contest everything the cop says. Who's that? What, you want me to perjure myself? Perjury? The whole goddamn thing is perjury. Maybe you should gallop your ass down to the police station and tell them who really did it. Okay, okay, alright, calm down, tell me, what do you want me to do? That's more like it. I talked to my attorney, he's gonna need a deposition from you, and we're gonna need to get our stories straight, so what time do you get off? Six. Good. So why don't you swing by my house when you get off and we can hash this whole thing out? Okay. I gotta get back to work. Hey, Jake. Thanks for comin'. Got a new car, huh? Yeah, I picked it up last week. Come on in. Let me grab you a beer. Hey, where's Roxy? Uh, she's at the vet. Anything wrong? No, just a routine check up. Hey, I got some ribeyes on the grill. We got time, you know, let me, you know, why don't you have a shot? No, why don't you tell me about this deposition. What do you need me to say? Jake, we'll get to that. Come on, how about a shot? No, I'm good. Hey, I'm workin' on some play off tickets. I'll keep you posted. Check it out, Jake. I just got back from the market, and I got all your favorite goodies. Caesar salad, garlic potato fries, ribeye... Max, Max, Max, stop, no, I appreciate it, but the truth is, I already have dinner plans, okay? I don't have a lot of time, so can you please tell me what you want from me? Come on Jake, what's the rush? The rush is I don't have much time, so please tell me what you want from me. Okay, I'll tell you what I want from you. First of all, I want you to lose that shitty fucking attitude. I'm the one facing the DUI, not you. Yes, I agree, so I mean, let's talk about it then. And I'm tired of that shitty look on your face. Here I am making you a nice dinner, cold beer. What's with you? You act like I'm dipped in kangaroo shit. And I'm sick and tired of it. All I ever did was love you. Man, I don't wanna hear that. Why? Why? Because I'm not gay. I mean, do you understand Max? I am not gay. Really? Yeah, what do you mean "really?" You're a misogynist. All you do is bash women. Do you even like women? Man, you're crazy. I'm crazy? You told me yourself I treat you better than Paula. You're in denial. Max, just stop it. Please, get these thoughts out of your head. Listen to me, I'm not gay. I'm never gonna be gay, okay? Now I appreciate what you did for me taking this DUI, but please, come on, enough. So, you appreciate me keeping you out of jail? Yes, I do. But considering the shit you're putting me through, I'm thinkin' jail's not such a bad option. I'm out of here. Come on, fight, Jake, fight. What? Is that all you got, Jake? Fight. This is what jail's like, motherfucker. Huh, this is what I'm saving you from. I'm just one man, Jake, there'll be five men. Jake, that's what I saved you from. Show some appreciation. You're sick. Jake. Jake. Come back, we haven't discussed the DUI. Okay, so what you're saying is, this guy is threatening you over this DUI because he says it's your fault? Yeah, that's right. When did this DUI occur? I don't know, it was like a few months ago. Oh wait, it was the Superbowl, and that was February third. What's this guy's name? Hey, pal, you want our help or not? Okay, Max Foster. Okay, Max Foster, there it is. February third. Hey, they dropped this DUI two months ago. Gave a citation for public drunkenness. No, no, no, it can't be. This thing's still ongoing. Is there more to this? Gambling, drugs? This isn't adding up. Okay, this is, this is kind of embarrassing, but, Max, he's gay, and I'm not, I mean I'm definitely, I'm heterosexual, but this guy just won't stop. I mean, he like, keeps bothering... I wanna talk to you off the record. Okay. Have you thought about beating the shit out of him? What? Look, you want the fa... This guy to leave you alone? Get him alone, no witnesses, and give him a beating he'll never forget. Eh, slap him once. Gay guys go down easy. Well this one's 6'6" and 260 pounds of solid muscle. Makes Carl Malone look small. Well, you know, nine time out of 10, these things just fizzle out on their own. He'll stop. No, no, no, not this guy, I mean, he's the Terminator, it's like... Going to Tito's, what do you guys want? Three with a side of beans. Yeah, same for me, and some of that extra salsa, you know, the hot stuff. Okay, okay, okay, so the officer says, "did you use that five iron to kill your wife?" And the guys says, calmly, "yes." And the then officer says, "how many times "did you hit your wife?" And then he says to himself, you know, two, three, four, counts, slowly, you know. And he says, "give me a five." - Jake. - Yeah? I'm sorry to interrupt. I just got a call from security. Your car is on fire. - What? - What? Well you, this is for you. - Hi. - Hello. Happy birthday. Thank you. Wait a minute, you're not even gonna question this guy? I'm telling you... This is unbelievable. Listen, I'm trying to tell you... Okay, okay. Yeah, yeah, thanks a lot. Paula, this is unbelievable. I'm telling the cops who did it, they didn't believe me. Are you sure it was Max? Maybe it was one of those girls you were texting. You know what, just do not even go there right now, okay? This fuckin' asshole has been stalkin' me for months, and you know it. What, now you're saying that you don't even believe me? All I'm saying is this is a serious crime you're accusing him of. How do you know it's arson and not mechanical? So a new car just blows up on its own? Dad, Max came. Hey, Paula. Uh, Max, can I have a word with you outside? Alright, I'll be right back, Sam. Max, what the fuck are you doin' here? I was invited. I don't want you here, you're psychotic. Psychotic? Yeah, my car was set on fire and I know it was you. Why would I do something like that? Don't play fuckin' dumb with me, alright? I found out about you. I spoke to the cops and they said that whole DUI was bullshit. You checked up on me? That's right, I did, and the cops said the DUI was dropped two months ago and all you were given was a ticket for being drunk in public. Hey, I don't know what you're talkin' about. All I know is that we gotta be in court next month. Man you don't fuckin' quit, do you? Jake, I'm just here to celebrate Sam's birthday and give her her present. No the fuck you are, you're not... Don't you fuckin' think you can tell me what I can or I can't do. Hey. I gotta go. I just stopped by to give you your present. It's the new iPad. Really? Fuck get away from my daughter! Get out! You crazy motherfucker, get out! You fuckin' blew my car up. You need to control that temper. You stay away from my daughter, get out of here. Fucking crazy. You're not welcome here. Go. Get out of here. Wait a minute, you're not gonna arrest him? I mean this guy assaulted me in front of my own house at my daughter's birthday party. I'm sorry, but there are no witnesses. Paula, you saw him punch me, right? Okay, what about the neighbors? Well now that's interesting because they said they saw you punching him repeatedly. Technically we should be arresting you but, considering the situation, we're not gonna do that. Oh, you're not gonna arrest me? Thank you officer, that's so helpful. Jake. Look, Mr. Roth, we're aware of your complaints and what happened to your car, and we're looking into it, so I suggest you calm down, go inside, and let us do our job. Are we clear? Yes, thank you officer. So you're telling me you didn't see him punch me? No. I wasn't gonna lie. Well what were you doing when I was out there? Your nails? It's time for you to go. Sam. Sam? Dad, I don't wanna talk to you. You ruined my party just because you're jealous of Max. Jealous? Jealous of what Sam? Jealous because he has a big house, a big pool, and you're just sleeping on Shank's couch. Shank, man, I do not know what to do. I mean these cops won't do shit. And after what just happened, I thought the guys would stop, but this fucker just called me an hour ago. And what'd he say? I don't know, I turned the phone off, I didn't wanna deal with it. Dang. Hey, have you ever researched this guy before? Let's research this crazy bastard. Killed in fire? Holy shit. This is heavy, man. I got some cousins, they can handle this. They live for this kind of shit. Would they kill him? No, but, after they get through with him, he'd wish he was dead. Think about it. I don't know how things got so screwed up between us. One moment we're best friends, the next we're enemies. Call me. Here I am, trying to work things out, but as usual, you don't give me the courtesy of a return call. You know what Jake? Fuck you. Who in the fuck do you think you are? You're dead to me. You're not even hot. Do you hear me, Jake? Fuck you, you piece of shit, fuck you. Hi, wha... I really need to talk to you. Okay, I have 20 minutes, that's it though, I'm expecting somebody. I'm just afraid. I don't wanna do to Jake what I did to Stacey. I just don't want that to happen. Max, you said that you had nothing to do with Stacey's death. Call 911! Hey, Sam. Hi. Want a ride? Um... My dad's supposed to pick me up. Just hop in, it's just a minute. There's something I wanna talk to you about. Okay, but, if my dad sees us, he'll get really mad. I'm not supposed to talk to you anymore. We'll just go around the block. You're probably wondering what all the fighting is about. Yeah. Do you know I'm gay? My dad told me. Did he also tell you that he's gay? Wait, he is? Your dad and I happen to be deeply in love with each other. Really? I mean, it's not something we planned, it just happened. And your mom has a problem with it. I mean, your dad loves you and he doesn't want to break up the family. He knows that would really upset you. But I... I wouldn't be upset if that's how he really felt. Well your dad isn't as honest as you. He's not even honest with himself. Hey, let's keep this our little secret, okay? Okay. Shank. Hey. What's up? How are you doin'? Oh, I'm good, how you doin'? Pretty good. You mind if I try out one of your drivers? No, man, go right ahead. Hey, hey, hey. Hey, dude. Hey, I bet this bad boy could do some damage. That's top notch right there. Hey, I understand that Jake's living with you. Yeah. Yeah, so? Is it true you fuckin' Jake? Oh, so he's fuckin' you? No, man. You the fag, not me, bro. I mean you could scare Jake and shit but you ain't gonna scare me, dog, bruh I'm from east LA, bro. - Okay. - Yeah. Real tough guy, huh? Hey, bro, you know what I'm sayin'? Hey, you know... Show me how tough you really are. Hey, Max, come on, man, you goin' too serious now. Just what I thought. It would be a good idea for you to kick Jake the fuck out. Comeprende? Yeah, man, I got it, bro. Yeah, Shank, what do you want? I'm real busy. Hey your dude came and paid me a visit at work today. What do you mean? I mean he came to the job, he choked up on me, you know. Said I gotta kick you out and everything. You still think he's goin' away? This was a good idea. Hey, you, I know you. Let's kick his ass. You get the fuck out of here. He's good. I think he saw us, he saw us. Hey bro, come on man. Oh man. Shh, shh, shh. Be quiet. Come on, let's go, let's get the fuck out of here. Come on drive, let's go. Hurry up man, let's go. You're an asshole, bro. Hey, that motherfucker comes around here, I'm using this shit on him. We should've used this shit in the first place. Hello? Yes, it is. Sure, okay. It's the police, man. They want me to come down. Thanks for comin' in. So you got into a fight tonight? Oh no, I just cut my hand washin' the glasses. Anyway, we got some good news for you. We got some video surveillance from across the street where your car was set on fire. Really? Is that the guy? That's him. Good, I just wanted to check, we're gonna go pick him up. What are you guys gonna charge him with? Everything. Terrorist threats, public endangerment. This fruitcake won't be bothering you anymore. That is so great, that is... Good. You go home, and we'll call you tomorrow. Okay, alright. Thank you officer. Thank you very much. Whoop, hey Mr. Silver, I think you dropped these. Thanks. So you were gonna play a little golf today? Nope, just checkin' out a new driver. Oh, you know what? I wanna apologize for what happened at the meeting. You see, I had a lot of stuff that's been goin' on... Jake. Shit happens. Don't worry about it. Chin up. Okay, have a good one. Jake, come here. Hey, Ray, what's up? Jake, we're gonna have to move you back to selling clubs with your buddy Shank. What? Why? I mean, does Silver know about this? These are his orders. He didn't like you. I don't know what it was, but he hated you. I mean, he really hated you. He wanted to fire you completely, but I talked him into at least letting you keep your old job. Jake, this is where you belong, alright? I got another really funny joke for you. Why don't you save it for Silver? Excuse me, buddy. Jake Roth? Yeah. Detective Brown, LAPD. This is Detective Munoz. We're here to inform you that Max Foster eluded officers when they tried to arrest him last night, and he is now a fugitive of the law. While investigating the premises, we discovered that he was watching your every move. Had cameras everywhere. Bedroom, bathroom, shower... What? This is insane, okay, where's my protection? What about my family's protection? What am I supposed to... We seriously doubt he's a threat to you. He's not a threat to me? This is all about me. Wait a minute, two of our men are in critical condition right now because of that guy. We have practically half the force out there looking for him as we speak. He's obviously on the run, scared, and in hiding. But we will find him. Of that I promise you. Okay, when you hear something, let me know. This gets more stations than we do at home. It's satellite, mom. Hey, Sam, they even got an internet hook up here. Why couldn't I bring a friend? This is gonna be so boring. Enough already, Sam. Can you at least tell me where we're going? You'll see when we get there. We have enough food to last almost a week. Look, dad, it's pepper spray for bears. Okay, well if a bear shows up, you use it 'cause I'm runnin'. And I'll be right behind ya. It's okay, I'll mace 'im. Poo! Get out of here. What are you doing? Where did you get that? Shank gave it to me. Put it away, it makes me nervous. What if Sam finds it? Relax, it's got a safety on it, everything's safe. It still makes me nervous. Okay, okay, okay. Okay, it's fine. Sam, put that away and go to bed. Now. - Put it away. - Okay. Paula, I called again, but there's still no news. Jake, what if they never find him? I mean, how long do you expect us to stay out here? Jake. Jake, wake up. What? I hear a noise outside. What? I think somebody's on the roof. Okay. It was just a raccoon. You know, I never told you I just got demoted back to selling clubs again. Oh no. Why? Because of all the shit that happened with Max. I was just, you know, kind of embarrassed to tell you. Don't be. You know, I never told you, but, it really meant a lot to me that you tried. Really? What I really want is for you to want to be part of this family. I'm sorry for what I did to you. Paula, I really am. Anyone wanna go for a five mile power walk? Pass. Yeah, I'll pass, too. We're gonna check out the lake. Alright. Bye. Thanks. Watch out for the bears. Morning. Morning, officer. You been drinkin' this morning, sir? You were swerving pretty good back there. No, just a little tired. Been driving all night. Can I see your license and registration, please? Sure. You know, I left it in the bed of my truck with my camping gear. You mind if I get it? Okay. Just keep your hands where I can see them. Hello? Jake, it's Detective Brown. We need to know where you are. I'm in Arizona. A sheriff pulled over Max 40 minutes ago and ran his plates. Oh that's great news. No, you're not listening Jake. We have not heard from the officer since. This was in Arizona. Sam, I need to ask you a question. Have you been talking to Max? No. Don't lie to me! Have you been talking to Max? Yes. Goddammit. How could you be so stupid? Why, what's wrong? What did I do? Be quiet, be quiet, let me think, you've done enough. I gotta call mom. She didn't take her phone, it's right here. You fucked us, Sam. Do you know what you've done? Come on, let's go, we gotta find her, let's go. Let's go, come on. I think she went this way. - Paula! - Mom! Max. What are you doing here? Paula, why couldn't you have just stayed away? Jake didn't want you, couldn't you tell? That's why he moved out. He got sick and tired of you and your fuckin' naggin'. "Jake, take out the trash," "Jake, mow the lawn," "Jake, do the dishes." You just couldn't accept it. He didn't love you, but you had to keep coming around with that sad, fuckin' face, makin' him feel all guilty. You've just gone and just fucked everything up. You know that? Max, it's true. Jake told me. Told you what? That he loves you, Max. He told you that? Yeah. I don't believe you. He told me about the dinners, and the late night talks, and how you bonded. And how you cooked for him, and how good he felt around you. No, you're fuckin' lyin'. No, Max. I didn't wanna believe it, but it's true. I'll go away and I'll leave you guys alone. Please, Max. I don't wanna die. Mom? Paula? Mom! Paula? Paula? Jake, she's gone. Stay back there. Hey you stay away from us or I'll shoot you right here, right now. She's gone. What do you mean she's gone? It's just gonna be the three of us now. We're gonna go to Mexico or Costa Rica. You sick fuck, you tell me where Paula is right now, or I'll shoot your fuckin' head off. She's gone. Max, I'm countin' to three. One, two... Dad, dad! Sam, sometimes your dad needs to be disciplined. You understand? Get up. Let's go, we've got a long trip ahead of us. Let's go. I don't know how to drive this contraption. Get this thing goin'. Max, come on, this is crazy, come on. Hey, this is not crazy. Don't fuckin' call me crazy. Sam, your dad just doesn't listen. Now get this shit goin'. Max, there's no way I'm leaving without Paula, it's not happening. You get this shit goin', you fuckin' understand me? Huh? I'm tired of you and this fuckin' Paula thing. It's gonna be the three of us, and we're gonna go to Mexico, you understand? And we're gonna be a fuckin' family. - You understand? - Max, please. Oh, shut the fuck up. Why don't you fuckin' love me? Sam. Max. You piece of shit. Die, die. Die. Die. Dad, the RV's moving! Dad, the RV's moving! Oh my god! Dad! Sam? Honey, are you alright? Yeah. I'm okay. It's over. It's okay. Max. Jake. Tell me, where's Paula, man? I love you. I know you do, so please tell me, where is she, man? Where's Paula? Max? Max? Max. Sam? Where's Paula? Sam? That's mom. Where? Mom? Sam. Hi, baby. Paula. Come here. It's okay, it's all over. You guys okay? Yeah, we're alright. Maxwell's in there. He's dead. We'll check it out. There's no one in there. Yeah, nobody home. What? Hold on, wait, are you okay? I'm good, I'm good. You forgot the mail. The mail, alright. "Dear Jake, how are you? "It's been a while. "Things did get a little crazy, didn't they? "But that's what love can do. "I'm doing well myself. "The sun and saltwater have done wonders "for healing my wounds. "Please tell Sam I forgive her. "I know she was doing what she thought was best. "I was also glad to hear Paula pulled through as well. "I never meant to hurt her, Jake, you do know that. "I wish I could write more, Jake, "but I'm off to my next destination. "So 'til our paths cross again, "thinking of those glorious, glorious days "of having you and Sam in my guest house. "Your friend, Max."
