COLLINSON: Look man, unless you want your legs broken, you better start talking to us. PETERS: Right here. Cool it, cool it. You know a man name of Freelong? I might. COLLINSON: Cut the might crap, Gruber. You know the guy. He lives here. He's a tenant here. Room 203. I represent a certain party who thinks he may be interfering with our business. So what do you want from me? We need information, all you can get. What kind of information? Oh, you know. Conversations, telephone calls, the usual thing. Leave the technical details to you.

PETERS: Yeah, warm it up [inaudible].. Charming friend you have. He has his uses. You screw up the deal, you'll find out what those uses are. Now we got a deal? Yeah. Good. Call you in a couple of days. Better have something for us. [bells ring] [music playing] I don't want to talk about it. All right. [interposing voices] DOLMAN: What do you want me to have with you for, anyway? How could you just go have sex in the elevator? What is with you? [inaudible] You know what I want? [silenced gunshot] [gunshots] [silenced gunshots] [music playing] Hey, Gruber. Hey look, I'm sorry I haven't catch you before.

No, it's all right. Look, the funeral, you know, the expenses that-- I'll get that first thing. First thing to you. [music playing] FREELONG: Dammit! DOLMAN: Oh, cool it, hon. JULIE: I wonder how it went. GILCHRIST: Don't worry, you'll be fine. You sure? Of course. JULIE: He terrifies me. If he found out, I don't know what I'd do. GILCHRIST: Don't worry about it. He'll never know. JULIE: [inaudible]. [whispering] We have to stick together. It's not [inaudible] just you and I. These people, they don't know what they're doing. They don't know what they're talking about. But with you and I, the two of us we've got all the fucking brains to make this happen [inaudible] believe that, don't you? All we need to do is get free. ADELE: Did I tell you Heidi Lamb is going to be playing at the Round Ring Room next week? No. No? Oh, but she's incredible! Look, she's 60 years old, right? A grandmother? And she's doing routines the women half her age can't do. PENFIELD GRUBER: Really? If you like exotic dancing, you know, you really can't miss her show. You know, you might like it. What is this? Good, isn't it? Kind of tastes-- Like beef bourguignon? Yeah. And you know what's amazing? What? There's no meat in it. No meat? None. What are these little things? Oh, that's just some tamarind root fungus I found at the market. Seaweed, some brewer's yeast. What's the matter, you look tense? You're not getting enough sleep, are you? I bet you're not even taking the vitamins I gave you. Ow! I have just the thing for you. You need more lecithin in your diet. I was thinking about that. You know, I've been thinking, maybe you should be taking better care of yourself. Maybe you need somebody to look after you? I think you do need somebody to look after you, see? Whew! I'll consider it. Wait, finish your lunch! My stomach's a little upset. That's why you need lecithin. All right. Are you going to come over for dinner tonight, or-- I have a lot of work to do. Well, I'll see you tomorrow for lunch, then? Yeah. Bye. [applause] PROFESSOR: (ON TV) Please welcome our guest lecturer, Dr. Penfield Gruber. PENFIELD GRUBER: (ON TV) Thank you. Thank you. The greatest challenge, and perhaps the greatest drawback with behavioral science is that we tamper not with static systems, but with human emotions. [laughter] [music playing] FREELONG: Anyone seen a clip of hollow point ammo? I left it right here. Huh? Yo, watch the dynamite, man. Watch it, watch it. Ha! Found it. I loved it. That look he had on his face when I whacked him. You what? Wasn't the look priceless? FREELONG: I whacked him. No, you hit the other guy. Yeah, I whacked him too. No, man, you took out the guy with the glasses. I whacked both of them. Right. Freelong's right. He did hit the other two guys. Of course I'm right. Yeah, you're right, man. Hey, which sounds better? Lawrence K Borden's Slumber Parlor or Lawrence K. Borden's-- FREELONG: Don't worry about it. How do you sell 15 pounds of smack? Huh? You need a distribution network to do that. We don't have that. Hawk has that. We can't sell until we get Hawk out of the way. Can we, Sandy? Right. Would you cool it? He's working with dynamite. We need to get rid of Hawk and his entire organization. Am I right? You're right. I'm working on another plan. We get together here next Tuesday night, I'll lay it all out for you. First thing we're going to need, heavier ordnance. We need heavier ordnance.

The cousin of the assistant manager at the Paladin Hotel in Las Vegas is coming to see my act tonight, so I'm a little nervous. Let's go. Now where'd you get a name like Lila? Just made it up. Would you gentlemen like a drink? We don't have time for that right now. Just one little drink, I insist. They have to go. PETERS: Some other time. Come back any time. Shut up. You never talk to me, and when you do, you don't have to dump on me. You could try being nice to me once in a while. Just try being considerate. I'm your friend, Pen. Besides, my big night's coming up, and I don't want you wrecking it with your attitude. You don't look so hot. You taking your vitamins? I liked your act. FREELONG: Anyone seen a clip of hollow point ammo? I left it right here. Huh? MAN: Oh, what's that? I want you to hear it through our speaker system. Come on right over here, we'll plug it in. It's a beautiful guitar, and I know you're going to love it. Plug this in. If I'm not mistaken, Buddy Dupree used one of these. Got a beautiful natural tone [inaudible] Who am I listening to now? FREELONG: (ON TAPE) --face when I whacked him. COLLINSON: Freelong. What? It's the guy I was telling you about. BORDEN: (ON TAPE) No, you hit the other guy. FREELONG: (ON TAPE) Yeah, I whacked him too. They Can't hear this, can they? - Not as long as the jack is in. - What? BORDEN: (ON TAPE) Freelong's right. Not as long as the jack is in. I can't hear what you're saying. BORDEN: (ON TAPE) You're right. Oh, don't. FREELONG: (ON TAPE) How do you sell 15 pounds of smack? Huh? You need a distribution network to do that. We don't have that. Hawk has that. We can't sell until we can't get Hawk out of the way. Freelong's got our property, all right. Hawk will want this cleared up fast. Arrange it. Hit him tonight.

HAWK: (ON TAPE) Wednesday's our wedding anniversary. [phone ringing] Yeah? PETERS: (ON PHONE) It's Peters. Stay out of sight tonight. PENFIELD GRUBER: Why? PETERS: Freelong and his friends will be checking out permanently. [music playing] Penfield! I wasn't expecting you. The light was off. Oh, I know, it's night. You know the cousin of the assistant manager I was telling you about? Huh? You know, the assistant manager of the Paladin Hotel in Vegas? Yeah, yeah. Well, his cousin caught my act. Good. And he's calling his cousin down in Las Vegas. Isn't that great? Yeah, that's great. Except he said I've got to work on some new routines. Here, tell me what you think of this. Can you turn that down, Adele? A bit? He said he'll work with me real close before I go. But it means I'm going to have to get down there on my own [inaudible] to audition, so I was just wondering maybe if you can wait a little longer for the rent I owe you? Don't worry about it. Then can you leave the music on, so that I can rehearse? Rehearse later, you have plenty of time. What do you mean, rehearse later? Look, this is my major break for me. Ssh, [inaudible]. You don't give a shit, do you? [inaudible]. You hate my act. PENFIELD GRUBER: I don't give a fuck about your act! Why are you so fucking stupid? It's all a come on, don't you understand that? The goddamn cousin of the cousin who's playing hotel just wants to fuck you! All the men want to do is see you naked. They don't give a fuck about your act. (SQUEALING) Oh! Oh! PENFIELD GRUBER: Hey! What are you doing? Getting away from you! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Come here. Get away from me. Come here, let me talk to you. Taxi! [inaudible] I'm sorry, I apologize. Let me talk to you for a minute. Let me talk to you, Adele, come on. You know I'm too upset. [inaudible] Where's my car? Where's my-- The car is in the lot. Come up to bed. PENFIELD GRUBER: Ssh. Don't you break my heart. Now you're always telling me to shut up. We're going to get a lot of trouble. You know, this isn't your car. Just keep your voice down. (WHISPERING) What if the police come? Police won't come. [inaudible]. Up. I don't know what it is with the chick, man. I bought her a ring, I asked her to marry me. She's fucking around on me. [inaudible] on your brain. Whatever you think is going to happen, that's going to happen. Psycho cybernetics. [inaudible] She's a real women's liberated woman. Mellow out. The mind. (WHISPERING) What's that? Oh no. If that's the police, we're going to be in big trouble. They're going to think you're trying to steal this or something. No, they won't. I'll buy it. [silenced gunshots] You know, if you want to buy this car, you should Rupert to lower the price. Hmm? There's a hole in the floor. I'll point that out. He's been your next door neighbor for years. I'm sure he wouldn't cheat you. He'd cheat his mother. See, that's what I'm talking about. He's your neighbor, and you don't dump on him like that. I'm sorry. Are you really? Yes. It's no go. Come on. [inaudible] stay cool. What's this psychosomatic shit? Psycho cybernetics. It's what you think is what happens. Positive thinking. Come on. [silenced gunshots] [dog barking] Killer legs, babe. Yeah, I got killer everything. [laughter] This is beautiful. Beautiful. They bounced, man. Did you see them bounce? Oh shut up. Now I want this meat shipped out of here now. OK? Come on, Borden. Let's take this turkey here. Flip him over, Borden. Oh, [inaudible]. You go with Sandy. OK. OK, clean it up. Clean it all up. Oh he's light. Rigor mortis don't set in for two hours. Yeah, I know, I know. See, when you get a body-- Enough of that shit, man. I don't want to hear about it, OK? How'd it go? Like a ballet. Let's go. Let's go. No, let's stay a while. It's a nice car. I think you should buy it. You don't mind if we stay a little longer, do you? No, it's OK. Hey, what are you doing? Did I tell you I'm going open up a funeral parlor with my end? You guys can be my first customers. [police radio chatter] Friends? Yeah, it's a Christmas party. Have you been drinking, sir? No, I'm just taking them home. They wanted to drive, but I said no way, let me do the driving. We've got wives and kids. What kind of a Christmas present is a funeral? You can go, sir. Personally, I have nothing against funerals. I'm an undertaker myself. Have a merry Christmas, sir. But funerals in December? Flower arrangements wilt in frost. It's undignified. I'm sure it is. DOLMAN: You book 30 days in advance, you get the seats for half price. Fuck that. I travel when I want how I want. DOLMAN: It's a waste of money. As soon as this thing goes down, we're going to have money to burn. I think we should invest some of it. Yeah, in some ordnance, real ordnance, some slipstream. You know, babe, I think you need a rest. Look at this jerk. What kind of a gun is that? 9 mm parabolic. What do mean I need some rest? You work too hard. You got to learn to relax, sit on a beach, get some sun. Fuck the beach. We're going to go all over the world, places we ain't never been before. Mm-hmm, first we need a rest. I said, I don't need a rest. DOLMAN: Mm-hmm. Oh, babe. I want to go to Paris. I want to go up the Eiffel Tower. I always wanted a drop a brick from the top of that thing. What's this? Are those the expenses? Mm-hm. You got to talk to Sandy and Borden. They waste ammunition. Who gives a shit? Ammo costs money. They're always firing on automatics. Well, not everyone's a crack shot, baby. How much is this? $900. Oh, talk about waste. Too much, babe. Not for five genuine leather suitcases. Fuck leather. What are you swearing for? Hmm? You want leather? You got leather. Good. FREELONG: Look, baby, we're going to go away. We're going to go all over the world. I mean, we can go to France, eat snails, eat frogs. We can go to London, see Big Bill. Ben. Whatever. The point is we got to get the fuck out of Canada. This fucking country. I mean, they used to have gun control here. Now every jerk's got a piece. We're not taking those jerks. You don't like Sandy and Borden? DOLMAN: They're losers. You want to get ahead, you got to move with a better crowd. You work with what you got. DOLMAN: They're amateurs. You think so? DOLMAN: They'll bring you down, babe. I'm serious, you go with them, and I'm not sticking with you. All right, all right. As soon as this thing goes down, I'll get rid of them. I'll whack them both. Let me do it. [laughter] Yeah, babe. HAWK: (ON TAPE) You alone? GILCHRIST: (ON TAPE) Yeah? HAWK: (ON TAPE) You hired the necessary personnel? GILCHRIST: (ON TAPE) I got somebody good. HAWK: (ON TAPE) Good GILCHRIST: (ON TAPE) Just one thing. Why Wednesday? HAWK: (ON TAPE) She knows too much. I don't like people who know too much. GILCHRIST: (ON TAPE) No, I mean why do you want her killed on Wednesday? HAWK: (ON TAPE) Wednesday's our wedding anniversary. [music playing] Are you following me? Yes. I have something for you. What is this? Your boyfriend, Gilchrist. I saw you meeting him at the motel. He's trouble. I don't understand. Is that where you live, at the motel? I own it. What is it you want? Money? No, no. I just want to help you. Help me? How? You should listen to the tape right away. What's on it? A conversation between Gilchrist and your husband. That's impossible. It's on there. Please wait. We could go talk somewhere. Where did you get this? Just listen to the tape. One of our people has turned. You think so? Freelong knew about everything. He was tipped. Well, maybe he was-- He was tipped! Who would do that? Whoever it is, he's dead. Yeah, right, dead. But who? We'll find him. And when we do-- We kill him. No one turns on us. Yeah. I'll cut out its tongue and shove it up his ass. Rip his heart out. Put his balls in a vice-- It had to have been someone high up in the organization. Got lots of people on the payroll. Someone we trusted. Lots-- lots of people. Someone close to us. How come? Move it. You're never there, Penfield. You never were. It doesn't matter anymore, I'm going. No more experiments, it's over. There's nothing that-- (CRYING) I hate you. [phone rings] PENFIELD GRUBER: Yeah? JULIE: (ON PHONE) I listened to the tape. Can you meet me? I have to talk to you. I have to talk to someone. Please? Hello. So-- Do you know him? "For alas, humankind cannot stand too much reality." I don't know what to do. I don't-- I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I just don't want people to see me like this. It'll be all right. It'll be all right. Who owns this place? A friend. Did you find out anything else? No. I'm so tired. Why did you marry him? I loved him. I know it sounds crazy, but I still feel something for him. He wants to kill you. I can't help it, it's a flaw in my character. Is there something I could do? I don't think so. I don't think there's anything to be done. You could leave the country. He has my passport. He has all my money. I know some people. I could get you a passport. And I could give you some money. You don't understand, it would never be enough. You can't hide from a man like that. How much would be enough? The kind of money we'd need, no one has. I don't think there's a way out. There's always a way out. We just have to think. Were you ever married? Once. Don't get involved in this mess. It has nothing to do with you. No, I want to. I want to help you. [music playing] What happened to your wife? She's gone. Where? Just gone. Don't go back. I have to. If he even senses I know, I-- I have to. Go to the police. I can't. Why? I just can't. Listen to me. I don't think we have much of a choice. How did you get the tape? I was listening to someone else. Who? That doesn't matter. JULIE: Why were you listening? He's going to kill you, that's all that matters now. I don't want to see you hurt. Let me worry about that. He's a powerful man. He has powerful friends. I wouldn't know who to trust. Go to the police. I'll go with you. I can't trust the police. Please, Penfield, don't be so naive. God knows who's he's got out there following. For all I know, he could have had me followed. It's late, I have to go now. He's expecting me. Thank you for tonight. [music - "jingle bells"] Partner, how you doing? Good. Come here. It's under control. COLLINSON: I don't know, man. Peters is getting suspicious. Got all kinds of fingers pointed at me. Of course you do, that's perfect. That's what I wanted, don't you see? They're going to want to meet with you. You sure you know what you're doing? Now listen to me. This is where come in. Hawk and Peters will want to meet with you. Oh, so I meet with them? Listen to me. You have to meet with them, that's how we whack them, with the exploding jacket that Sandy's rigging. You meet with Hawk and Peters. [baby crying] I meet with them. Will somebody tell that kid to shut up? (CRYING) Mommy! Now you listen to me. You meet with Hawk and Peters. I can't wait to see the look on that guy's face when he realizes what's going down. You tell them everything's cool. You drop off the exploding jacket. I call up. It rings. I hang up. You hear it ring, you get the fuck out of there. The jacket explodes. Now do you understand? It took me months to work this out. Don't fuck it up. Just do what I say. Man, this is really coming together good, partner. Yeah, man. Trust me, OK? Oh, ah-- no, it's OK, It's OK. Well, this is going to be a very merry Christmas. PENFIELD GRUBER: Janine, don't die, don't die. Don't die. I didn't know. I didn't know. Oh, don't die, Janine. Don't die. [phone rings] Yeah? PETERS: (ON PHONE) It's Peters. Yeah? PETERS: (ON PHONE) We're shutting down the operation. We're wrapping things up. You got any more tapes? Mm-hmm. PETERS: (ON PHONE) Bring them to 47 Rustic Road at 3 PM. Yeah. PETERS: By the way, it was nice doing business with you. I appreciate discretion. [dial tone] [doorbell] COLLINSON: Who is it? Just a delivery boy, Mr. Hawk. Don't bother counting, Gruber. It's all there. What are you looking at? I forgot my purse. COLLINSON: Piss off. [music playing] Gilchrist. [tires screeching] Just pretend you're filling up. The fucking pumps are locked, Gilchrist. Just pretend. I picked this place because it was deserted. Brilliant. Now how about asking yourself what the cops are going to think when they see us standing here holding our frozen dicks in our hands in a closed gas station in the middle of a snowstorm? I didn't know it was going to snow. He called me. Told me to hit Julie on Wednesday. So you want me to hit her on Wednesday? Now when do you want me to hit her husband, Hawk? The next day or the same time? GILCHRIST: Wednesday. But I don't want you to kill Julie. FREELONG: Pardon me? You got the hots for her, pal? Back off. You playing with a full deck? Hey, who told you the drug deal was going to go down? Me, right? FREELONG: Right. So don't worry about it. I got it all under control. You ain't bright enough to have it all under control. You're as dumb as Collinson. What I want to know is how come two dummies are all of the sudden getting bright ideas. You better be playing straight with me, Gilchrist. I'm warning you. I don't know why you're talking to me like this. I'm your friend. Fuck off, Gilchrist. I'll call you. [music playing] Why didn't you tell me he was your husband? I was afraid of what you would think of me, being with a man like that. I was ashamed, Pen. You could have told me. I didn't know who I could trust. I didn't know if I could trust you. You knew the drugs belonged to your husband. - No! - Didn't you? No! Did you know Freelong and Gilchrist knew each other? - No. - You're lying. I'm not! Why would I? You must have seen people at the motel. No, I didn't. You must have seen him with Gilchrist sometime, somewhere. I didn't-- no, no. I mean-- yes, I-I-- Is it yes, or is it no? Yes, I saw them together, but I never thought-- I didn't-- I didn't think it mattered. I didn't put anything together. Why would I? You didn't think it mattered? No! I swear, I'm telling you the truth. You have to believe me. Everything that's going on is crazy. I think I'm going crazy. Please, I need you, Pen. You don't want to go away with me anymore, do you? That's it, isn't it? My husband-- he's gotten to you. PENFIELD: What? My husband, he's threatened you, or he's paid you off, or something. What are you talking about? I just wanted to be with you. What do you expect me to think when I saw you standing there with him? Do you know what went through my mind? Yes, I want to go away with you, yes, yes. ADELE: Penfield? My, you have a lot of TV's. Your door was open. Off to Vegas? No, I changed my mind. I went to visit my mom and dad instead. I don't think I have what it takes to make it in Vegas. I've just been kidding myself, and been doing some thinking. And it's not for me. Thank you, Pen. I was looking forward to a nice hot shower. And no soap, man. Nice place you got here. Really nice establishment. Kind of reminds me of a heartache hotel, man. I got a big gig happening tonight. Wish me luck, baby. OK. Peace and love, man. Peace and love. Close the door. I [inaudible] baby. GILCHRIST: (ON TAPE) Hey, come here. Come here. Mm. Hey, [inaudible] [moans] [whispering] RICH: So how are things? PENFIELD: Fine. Yeah? Whoa. Hey, it's decaf. Listen, remember that experiment Michael stole from you a few years ago? I stole it back. You know they pulled his grade? Well, he was welcome to it. It wasn't any good. RESEARCHER: We're getting some feedback, stand by. RICH: I think you were on the right track. I mean, I've changed the conditions a bit, but the results are better than electroshock. Is it really? Yeah, the guy's a schizophrenic. I keep him awake for 72 hours, then let him sleep. Man, you wouldn't believe the nightmares. It's like a freight train going through his head. ANDERSON: Heartbeat's coming up. RESEARCHER: Watch for balance abnormality. [heart monitor beeping] RICH: Pen? There was a time when you thought this was a lot of fun. I know. I used to think a lot of things were fun. RESEARCHER: What's his blood pressure? ANDERSON: 180 over 60 and climbing. [screaming] RESEARCHER: Stand by the remote IV pump. [heart monitor beeping faster] Listen, I need your SBU. What's on it? Two people talking. What's on top? Running water. Jankovich, get in here. I need a tape scrubbed. 10 cc sodium amytal, on the double. Don't pump him till I give the word. [heart monitor racing] RESEARCHER: His heart has moved onto the Richter scale. You got to bring him down. RESEARCHER: Not yet. ANDERSON: His goddamn brains are frying, reel him in. Pump him now. Line in. Jesus Christ, he almost arrested. RESEARCHER: You're such a suck, Anderson. You really are a suck. GILCHRIST: (ON TAPE) What's going on? JULIE: (ON TAPE) What? GILCHRIST: (ON TAPE) Collinson thinks he's going away with you, after sell the smack. JULIE: (ON TAPE) That's what I want him to think. GILCHRIST: (ON TAPE) He says you've been fucking him. JULIE: (ON TAPE) Men say those things, darling. GILCHRIST: (ON TAPE) Freelong's going to kill your husband tonight. Should I get the smack? JULIE: (ON TAPE) No, there'll be plenty of time later. --time later. Don't worry. After we kill him, it's just you and me, I promise. Let me guess, not good, right? I'll get some air. Thanks, Rich. Hey-- Hey, if you need help, you know where to find me. PENFIELD: (ON TV) Don't die! Don't die! Don't die! [inaudible] I didn't know. GILCHRIST: (ON TAPE) I got it all under control. FREELONG: (ON TAPE) You ain't bright enough to have it all under control. You're as dumb as Collinson. What I want to know is how come two dummies are all the sudden getting bright ideas. GILCHRIST: (ON TAPE) He told me to hit Julie on FREELONG: (ON TAPE) So you want me to hit her on Wednesday? Now when do you want me to hit her husband, Hawk? The next day or the same time? GILCHRIST: (ON TAPE) Wednesday. GILCHRIST: (ON TAPE) What's going on? JULIE: (ON TAPE) What? GILCHRIST: (ON TAPE) Collinson thinks he's going away with you after we sell the smack. JULIE: (ON TAPE) That's what I want him to think. GILCHRIST: (ON TAPE) Freelong's going to kill your husband tonight. Should I get the smack? JULIE: (ON TAPE) No, there'll be plenty of time later. Don't worry, after we kill him, it's just you and me, I promise. [music playing] OK, try it on. Is it safe? Of course it's safe. Now listen to me. There's a switch in the left pocket. You go in there, you wait for my phone call. I don't talk to you. Let's listen to me, I make the call, you throw the switch. That gives you 10 minutes before it blows up. 10 minutes? Now listen to me. There's 10 pounds of dynamite in this coat. There's enough to sink an aircraft carrier. How's it fit, huh? How's it feel? It looks good on you. It fits great. They got another one like this in the store? Tomorrow, tomorrow. The minute you throw the switch, get the hell out of the house. You know the phone number, right? I know the number! Forget about that. OK? I'd like to speak with Mr. Hawk. (WHISPERING) Go in the door. Five, four, three, two, one. [explosion] Way to go, Sandy. You always were, handy. How'd it go, babe? Like a ballet. Now we whack Borden. Had an axe, gave his mother 40 whacks. (WHISPERING) I wish I had a chain saw. Let's go. [gunshot] [phone ringing] Yeah. JULIE: (ON PHONE) Did you get it? Yes. JULIE: (ON PHONE) I'll pick you up first thing in the morning. I'll be waiting. JULIE: I love you. [dial tone] [gunshots] [whispering] [music playing] I'll get the tickets. Darling? Don't be long. I'll be with you in a minute, OK? Thank you. Hello, darling. Happy anniversary. [gunshots] [music playing]
