Look, Mom, I painted the shell purple. Beautiful. Whoa there, Blackbeard! How about we drop the knife? Hold on a sec. Ooh! Come on, you're gonna help me conquer the ocean. Look out! Here come the scary fish! They have big old bumpy heads and tiny little tails! So watch out! Whoo! Daddy! Hey! My princesses! So, did you two miss your shark? - Yeah! - Yeah! Now the shark will restore some order around here! Here he comes! - Ah. - You came back early, huh? Yeah, that was a mistake. Have you eaten? Anything in the fridge? You don't like it? Hmm. You're better in gray. - perfectly normal. - What department are you in? Nina, have some Belgian chocolates! I can't. I'm really behind. I'm just spinning my wheels until they hire someone to help me. What are you doing here? I've worked here for years. Are you... Uh, I start today. Fashion and lifestyle. With me? With you? So I've been waiting for you then? - How you guys doing? - Yeah, doing great. Have a good night. TONIGHT YOU'RE SLEEPING WITH ME When did you come back to Poland? Yesterday. Straight from Amsterdam, in the afternoon. After ten years, I run into you first day I'm back. We're a good match, aren't we? Fuck. I wish I could stay here forever. You feel it? This incredible connection we have? It's an unbreakable bond. I don't know how you got so drunk on one glass of wine. It feels like the first wine I've had in my life. Like the first sex in my life. - Mm-hmm. - So, password's there in the drawer. Okay. Get your identification card. You can do that downstairs later. What else? Be here at 9:00 on the dot. Unlike me. - Hi, Nina. - Hey. Thank you. - I'm not sure the two of us have met. - No. - Hey. Janek. I'm new here. - Agnieszka. Intern or trial period? Trial period. Just don't be too hard on him, okay? I hope you stick around. I have a feeling that you and I have a lot in common. Agnieszka, how about you save this for later? You'll have more time after work. Oh, Nina, Nina, come on! How many chances do you get to meet your dream-guy? One? Obviously there's something going on between us here. Give us a chance, huh? Joking! Not funny, I guess. Anyway, if you want decent coffee, come to my department, since your machine is crap. Agnieszka. I'm done. All right, I'm going now. All right. Later. Okay, why don't we talk about work? Take a look at the layout of the site. If you've got any questions or anything, I'm right here. What's up, Mom? What are you eating? Don't worry. It's just a side effect of me trying to pay attention. Never mind. I wanted to ask what Dad and I should bring this evening. You don't have to worry. I'll buy everything on my way home from work. Okay. We'll bring something special anyway. Okay, bye-bye! Maciek, I completely forgot. Well, I certainly didn't. Please, let's not get into who did what. It's crazy at work. I can't leave the office early. - Plus, I have a new assistant, and... - Baby, just say what you want. Could you please pick up the girls? It would really help me out. I need time to arrange something for tonight. Sorry, I'm busy! Why don't you just call your mom? I'm not asking for advice, I need help. Calling my mother would be a death sentence. If she found out I forgot tonight, she'd murder me. Nina! Look, I'm sorry, but I have to go. I have a meeting. Great. That's just great. Mama! My client is interested in hiring you as the CEO of their publishing house. I see you're still not giving up. But I like the determination. Go on. Seduce me. Ms. Janowska, I know it isn't proper for a gentleman to discuss money with a woman. I thought you'd wanna know that at the new company, your salary would be doubled. Are you ready for me to take your order? Yes, I'm gonna have the vegetarian carpaccio and the celeriac terrine. That's all. Add another carpaccio. And what else? Mmm. Do you have vegetarian options other than the terrine or the boiled beetroot, by any chance? Then I'll have what she's having. I know, I know, I'm sorry. Can you believe I forgot I'm supposed to be hosting a party tonight? I had to go shopping. There were huge lines. I'm sorry, we must be the last ones. They aren't here. Otherwise, you would be. - Wait, what? - Their grandma got them. - My mom? - Mm-hmm. Oh, great. So she knows. - Daddy, what are you doing here? - Hey! - Hi. - Just helping out a bit for the party. - Where are Mom and the girls? - They'll be here in a minute. Wow! - How did you carry that by yourself? - In my teeth, of course. Maciek had to work. Oh, what? And you didn't? If only one half of the couple is sacrificing way more than the other half, then that means the quality of that relationship... I know. Believe me, Dad, Maciek sacrifices a lot by being with me. You're very familiar with my ADHD. By now, I'm a black belt in it. I keep forgetting everything, stumbling around. At least he's got a passion. Sweetie. A month away in Iceland? He always makes sure to leave in August when I'm the least busy. Don't pester me. Thank you for the tulips. I just love tulips. If I could fall asleep covered in tulips, I would. Beautiful tulip slumber! Let's see here. - Excuse me. - Afternoon, sir. - Nine red ones, please. - Mmm, roses or tulips? - Either one of them. - Okay. Hmm. You two have been married now for nine years, and you've got everything. You know why that is? Because you're strong together! First, you two light the fire. And then you keep the flame burning. And although living with our Nina isn't the easiest, she still gave you these two wonderful children. Together, you're four parts of a whole. All right now, blow out the candles together for good luck. Quickly! Daddy? You and Mom were supposed to do it together. Uh... Grandma said be quick! Don't worry, darling, I'll blow out the candles next year. Mmm, you see what I mean? He loves me in his own way. Oh! It looks delicious. Mmm! That must be home made. What'd I do to deserve you as a mother-in-law? You're the only one who appreciates me. See? In his own way. I don't love parties. But that cake was delicious. Did she come up with that speech on her own? I'm sure it was from a self-help book. Three-Hundred and Sixty-Five Ways You Can Have a Happy Marriage. But our next anniversary is gonna be just for us. You and me, we'll have a chance to talk, make love, talk more. Yeah, right. - Making love, Banging, banging, banging. - Yeah, talk! Know what? She ought to be a priest. There'd be less divorce. I'm begging you, stop talking about her. Make love to me. Oh. Um, well, how about a quickie? - Can I sleep with you? - Oh! Zuza, come over here! - Good morning, boss. - Hey. Well, looks like I was here first today. You look great. Oh, thanks. So... I thought you were staying in the Netherlands for good. That was the plan. And then? And then, life changed my plan. Learn anything while you were there? Everything. So, it was worth it. Okay. We need to come up with some big ideas for the next series. All right. Think, what's something that inspires us? Your coffee machine's a piece of crap. Thanks. Okay. For example, our body, along with everything it entails. Super. - That was just an idea. - A great one. - Yeah? - Mm-hmm. Okay. So that's it. Our body. - Relationship to the body. - Hmm. Do you think people like their bodies? In general? No. I think most people don't, uh, like their bodies that much. Okay. Do you? Do your own research. Autonomy. Who has power over our bodies? The state, God, us. There's identity. Our relationship to gender, mmm, to nature. Mmm, body in social media. What we show, what we don't, what we try to communicate. Uh, how we want to be seen. We could go on forever. It's getting a bit cluttered. We need something to tie it together. Umm... BODY - RELATIONSHIP AUTONOMY - CULTURE - IDENTITY We have bodies, but they don't define us. Will you go to prom with me? No. Why not? A high school senior with a journalist? Do you want your friends to make fun of you for liking moms or something? What's wrong with that? Moms are the most beautiful. Portrait of a man with daisies in his hair. Inspirations. Got anything? Not really. You? Mmm, maybe something in here? Hmm. It's about all kinds of bodies. You can't judge your own body, you have to accept it unquestioningly. Like love. You have daughters? Lena and Zuzia. Hold on, don't move. I'm in charge now. If we have children, we're going to pick names for them together, right? Mm-hmm. And if we have a little girl, I think I'd like her to be named Lena. I really like "Lena." If we have another one, how's Zuzia? Zuzia is nice. - You guys seem like a nice couple. - A photo's a photo. Doesn't define you? Hey, baby. Just doing a little shopping. - Yes, I remember. I'll get everything. - Get some stain remover as well. Right. Got it. I'll buy everything plus that. Bye. I came over to see how you're doing. - Always gotta be the big sister, huh? - Aww, come on now. I just like to know what's going on with you. When can we expect a visit? It's tough to say. I... I still have some things to take care of, and then I'll visit. Hey. Why are you acting so weird? Huh? Wait, are you in love? Oh my gosh! I don't believe it. You are in love! Tell me who she is, huh? How old is she? What does she do? She pretty? She's beautiful. Smart, and... a journalist. Um... Older. Oh no. And she's married with children. Married with children? Seriously? You wanna break up somebody's marriage? Hey, Janek. Hey, look at me. Listen, this is not a good idea. Do you see that? Don't expect me to get you out of trouble again, okay? - I'm not gonna, so don't even ask. - Listen. I tried running from this love once before. Oh fuck. MOST PEOPLE DON'T ACCEPT THEIR BODIES. IT'S SAD WILL YOU JOIN ME IN THE WAR AGAINST THE ADVERTISING INDUSTRY? Hey, it's midnight. Come on. YES, I WILL. TWO LONE WARRIORS IT'S MIDNIGHT SLEEP TIGHT, WARRIOR - So, what's the toast? - To us. Today, I finally managed to convince Janowska to sign the contract. Mmm, congratulations. Thank you. But now I think I deserve a little reward. Maybe we could take a weekend away? Relax a bit. Great idea. Let's do it after I'm back from Iceland. But you're not leaving for another two months. You're right, but I decided to move the trip up a little bit. It's beautiful there now, with the midnight sun. Yeah? Hey. Don't get upset. Seriously? You want to leave me alone here to take care of everything? Daycare, school. Back and forth. Lena's choir. Zuzia's art class. I'm supposed to deal with all of that all alone? Really? With my new project at work just starting? Are you trying to kill me? Please don't be dramatic, hon. I'm not being dramatic. You can't just run off and leave everything for me! You know I'm already stressed out. There's more than I can handle. I know! That's why I'm coming back in a month. - Mommy, I made you some cereal! - And I made toast! Wow, that's great! Thank you, girls, that's so sweet of you. So what's the occasion? Some kind of Princess Day I forgot? Daddy told us you were feeling trained. Wait, trained? I think you mean "drained," honey. Yeah, drained. - Ah! Drained. I forgot what it was. - Drained. That's right. Yay, we're going to our grandparents! - Grandparents? - I'm taking them for a few days. To my mom's place. So you can get some rest. To your mother's? Don't you think that's a good idea? No, it's great. You think we've got it? I think so, yeah. I must have over a hundred here. I've got a thousand. It's just an experiment. I'm sure we'll find something soon. Yeah, we will. - What am I? - Um, that? - Christmas tree? - I'm a gray heron. - What's this? - No idea. I'm Daniel from Cobra Kai. Watch out. We should be careful. We can't just go with the flow. Huh? We can't just let the river take us this time. - Me first! - Come on, we'll be late! Buckle up, you guys. What are you doing? Change of plans. Hey, girls, say bye to Daddy, huh? Hold on, we were supposed to drive you. I even took the whole day off. - And the girls... - They'll be cranky. We'll be frustrated. Okay girls, go back inside. Go on! Bye! Baby, do you really wanna get stuck in traffic? Or wander the airport? Come on! Maciek, you don't understand. It's good for us to drop you off. I know what's good for you, because I love you. I'll call you. You got one! - Can we have another? - Yes. - Can I get three? - No, you can't. We're only allowed two. That's right. - Strawberry, please. - Of course. Mango. - Here you go. - Thank you. Here you go. - For you, miss? - Um, mango, salted caramel. Come on! It's weird, I feel so valued with you. Maybe because I'm giving you food. And I scare off wild animals. Crap, sorry. It's okay. Sorry. I forgot my phone. I'm gonna call my parents. I wanna see how the kids are doing. For our body series. You look great. Is that for the series too? Do you think the photos we've chosen are a bit too erotic? Mmm, that wasn't the intent. What was? It was just to show the body. For me, it's about hidden beauty. Hello? Yes? Zuzia? Okay, I'll be there. I've gotta run. - Need some help? - No. Take care, my friend! Nina, thanks for calling. Listen, I can't talk for long. My battery is dying. Do you know where our first aid kit is? - What? - I said the first aid kit. I took it with me. Why? You didn't leave anything? Not even a pain reliever? At least you could have asked first. What's the problem? Zuzia is sick, she's got a fever. That's just the way it is with kids. She'll be fine tomorrow. She's got a fever, okay? She's at 39.9! She's throwing up. I can't leave her alone. Nina, I can't do anything from here. Can you just figure something out? Oh, oh! The battery's dying! Perfect. Wonder Woman to the rescue. Think of it as team-building. One drink won't kill you. - Well, actually I... - Oh! I've been wanting to do this with you ever since we first met. Have a beer? - Someone should hire me to advertise beer. - Oh, Janek... - What? - You know what I meant. So hey, tell me something. You've been there for a while, right? Mm-hmm. How well do you know my boss? - Nina? - Yeah. Mmm. Two children, very handsome husband. - Uh-huh. - And always running late. - Mm-hmm. - I'd say she's a little... - You don't get along? - Oh, no, I wouldn't say that. But the two of us aren't exactly friends. - I mean, she's so old! - Oh. Not like us. Two young bloods! Let's run there! - What? Wait. - We can run to the bar. Um, wait a sec. Hold on. Speak of the devil. Sorry. - Hello? - Janek. Listen, I've got nothing in the house. No cough syrup, no aspirin, nothing. - Should I bring something? You need help? - Yes. Something for a cough and vomiting. Ask at the pharmacy. - Tell them it's for a six-year-old child. - Uh-huh. Got it. Sorry, change of plans. Gotta run. Hey. - I brought some meds. - Great. Come in. Okay. Zuzia, we'll get rid of the fever in no time. You'll feel better soon. - Let me see what you brought. - Um, here's the medicine. A little snack for the girls. They can have it later. Only one for each of them. I got you food too. I'll give her the meds, put the girls to sleep, and we'll eat. Wait here. CALL ME, EVEN AT NIGHT, IF YOU NEED ANYTHING Who is it? - Good morning, miss. - We're having lentil soup today. Did you leave any for the candy delivery man? Okay, that's enough! I picked a good time. Hey guys! - Hey. - Hi. What would you say to life-changing tofu to go with that soup? It's that good. And for dessert, a candy bar for Zuzia, uh, for Lena, sesame candy, and for Mom there's coconut yogurt. Of course, for Dad, dark chocolate. How did you know that? I told him yesterday. So who can tell me what we should start with? I can! - Start with candy! - No, with the soup! Aw, please? With the soup! You go away! Zuzia. No big deal. It's all good, no worries. So, I'm heading out. Thanks for lunch. Bye, Lena. Bye. Thank you. Thank you. Bye. Hey. Hello. How's it going without me? Oh, knew it! Can I talk to the kids? Lena, it's Dad. Hi, Dad. Hello. How are you? I didn't go to school because Zu is sick. Is Grandma helping you guys out? Not Grandma, Janek. Who's Janek? Mom's friend. He bought me some sesame candy. What? Sesame candy. He brought something for everyone. You got dark chocolate. That's great. Can I talk to Mom? Yes? - Who's this Janek guy? - A friend from work. He's helping out. He got some meds for me. Couldn't you ask your mother? I could have. But I already have two children to deal with. And I don't need my mother around right now. - Are you all done? - Mm-hmm. That's good. Mom! Hey, what brings you here? What were you thinking, asking a stranger for help? Instead of asking your own mother. You know how things can get between us. We don't always see eye to eye. - Maciek asked me to come. - Mm-hmm. And that's exactly why we'll never get along. Do you notice anything like a fire or flood? Or me hiding under the table because of an earthquake? Are you done? I'm supposed to sleep in Maciek's office. Mom! Tell Janek that we're all out of sesame candy! Grandma! Sweetheart! Don't forget the candy! We're all out of candy. Hello? Is everything okay? It's fine. You sound a little weird. Maciek, I'm working. I can't talk. You know how it is. Are you mad at me? Did you give me a reason? What am I supposed to do with this? Leave it. I'll take care of it later. There's something wrong here. What a shocker. You always manage to find something wrong. All I'm saying is that you should spend more time focusing on your children. Isn't it enough that you're focusing on them? If we both focus on them, they might feel a bit overwhelmed. - Unless you're going back home? - No, no. I'm staying. Until poor little Zuzia starts to feel better. I hope you'll be back to yourself by then. Zuzia should get better in three days. Hey, you should read this. It says here that when a cell comes into contact with the environment, its DNA changes. - Epigenetics? Is that what you mean? - Yeah, exactly. It's connected to the body, so we could take a look at it? I'm getting the feeling this series is going nowhere. No, what I'm saying is that we start with the body. You start with the body and end up lost in the Bermuda Triangle of body, psychology, and love. Nina. Come over. Tonight you're sleeping with me. - Place is nice. - It's not quite finished yet. These are some souvenirs from my sister's children. I haven't been able to get them off. You're talking to an expert. I would recommend using omega-3, along with a hair dyer set high enough to burn off all your skin, And if you have any more questions, I'll have to do that. I like it here. Matches my style. Yeah? But your house doesn't look anything like this. Well, that's not my style. That's Maciek's. Are you going to grow tulips? You'll have to get used to my body's new shape. These stretch marks are from children who weren't yours. It doesn't define you. Great. What's going on, Zu? How are you? I got a new toy from Grandma! Look! It's an interactive seal toy. Its tongue is already broken. Then why don't you tell Mama to fix it? No, she can't. It has to be done by a professional. And Mama doesn't have time for silly things like that. That what Mom said? No, it was Grandma! And why doesn't Mama have time? I'm here, you know. You can ask me yourself. Well, I'm asking. Because I'm working. Since when did you start working nights? Since Mom is here to take care of the girls. Thanks to you. Thank you. Okay, now it's bedtime for my seal! Hey! Don't touch it! It's mine! Hey, stop it! No! Hey, hey! Be nice. Let go! - Hmph! - Cut it out! Turn left. - Hold on, no. Turn right. - Not left? No. Right. Take my word for it. In 400 meters, turn left. - Do you feel good? - Mmm. We should come back here again sometime. Together. I guess that's up to you. I wasn't sure if this was a continuing thing. You look great together. Like a couple in a romantic commercial. Oh, we're not a couple. All right. Please get ready for the massage. Hey, you, sir. Get ready for the massage. I like your driving. It's gentle. Really. Why don't you ever drive to work? It's Maciek's car. I don't really have anything besides my children. You got me. Though I'm a child as well. Nah, I'm kidding. I'm a serious, mature man. I mean it. Careful, I wanna live! - Slow down a little. - Smell that? - You know what it smells like? - Mm-hmm. Like the forest. Like freedom. Meadow. I'd like to stay here forever. - Here? - Mm-hmm. We could build a cabin just for us. Mm-hmm. Live on sex and root vegetables. Watch out! Why don't you just move in with me? You mean I wouldn't have to eat bugs off the ground? You would get as much sex as you wanted. I'll send my children to an orphanage. That puts us back at square one, right? There's no way out for us. I'll set up a kids' room at my place. Nina! Did something happen? Mom, I've fallen in love. Then you fall out of it! No. It won't work. I can't live without him. Then wait it out. You just have to wait this feeling out. You want me to leave him then? Now, you listen. No. Please, Mom. I'm begging you, be on my side this once. You know I am. I'm on your side no matter what! I'm not saying anything. Only this. You really have to think this one through. Where are you going to live? What will you live on? And the children? Does he have any? No. Is that good? It is, and it isn't. What if he wants children? Have you thought about that? A man will always want his own children. I just don't know what to do. What am I going to do? I don't know. Just remember that... family's the most important thing in life. Believe me. Because if you choose to stay... the only person hurting will be you. If you decide to go... you will all come out of it scarred. You, the children, Maciek, even... your new man. It doesn't matter if you do things nicely or cruelly. Either way, I always come out scarred in the end. Remember. You cannot make happiness on others' misery. That's all, my dear. Hi. Hey. Hey. I edited the photo, so you can't tell that it's us. - Hmm. - But it is us. Sit down. I'll show you. Look. We'll just add some text here, and we're done. By the way, I wanted to tell you that I got an answer back fr... Are you for real now? What? Nina, I really didn't expect this from you. - Wait, what? - This borders on workplace harassment. Jesus, Agnieszka... - Don't worry about her. - What were you starting to say? Uh... Got an offer from the competition. I'd be covering, uh, lifestyle stuff. When did... I applied for the job back in Amsterdam. Mmm. You should go. It's just about having options, you know? Having a choice. What? It's better for us if you accept it. I can't take it any longer. It's all too much for me. Children, family, my work, Maciek. I'm not as free as I was. This is killing me. Nina. Let's not make any rash decisions here. We have to end this. What? Hi. Hi. I thought I could make it, you know? I was sure of it. And you did make it. You did, man. Yeah, well, it was a close call. I thought, "I'm gonna give up." But then, you know, the adrenaline just kicked in. Yeah. And it felt goddamn good. And here I am. With age, the adrenaline is not enough to make you feel alive. Here you go. Thanks. Thank you. How long have you been trekking on your own? Three weeks. I wanted to, uh, go with my girlfriend. We were planning it for a really long time. But, uh... she was always right there in front of me, and I... I had no idea she meant so much to me. If I had known, everything would have played out differently. I wouldn't have broken up with her so hopelessly. Ah. People... People are important. I've been going through a rough patch with my wife lately. And... ...it got boring. I needed to get away to understand... what emptiness can really be, you know? Hey. Don't worry. Eat. Everything will be fine. Not everything. She had cancer, and I didn't know. She never told me. I broke up with her, and then, after two months, she... Fuck. I know, it's a shame. We're all going to miss him. He'll do well there. - Worst case scenario. - I'll be there. - Okay, I'll talk to you then. Bye. - See you later. Are you coming? To Naturalna. We're celebrating Janek's new position. No, I don't think so. Guess not. You are done, after all. It's better this way. For everyone. Drop it, Aga. All right. See you later, then. - Grandpa! - Hey! There are my favorite girls! What are you doing here? I just wanted to see you guys, that's all. Watch out, you're crushing him! All right. Come on. Let's go. Come on. Dad, you can't help me. I know what the solution is. Well, if that's true, then... what are you waiting for? Because the solution is impossible. Like the Escher stairs. The Escher stairs are an illusion. However, your life, now that's real. You know, when love goes unfulfilled, you're left... empty. Then bitterness fills that void. You grow indifferent towards life. I lived through something like that. And in the end, I chose family. The right choice. That's what they say. Your children's happiness comes before your own. Obviously, that's how it should be. But can children really be happy when their parents aren't? How could they? Oh Dad, don't talk like that. Of course they can be happy. Really? Were you happy then? - I wasn't. - Hmm. That was because of Mom, though. Hmm. Her need to control everyone and everything. And the way she always treated you. Exactly. Now you know why. This isn't an impossible Escher staircase. This is simply cause and effect. TATRAS It doesn't make sense. Stop it. You're making this harder. This is the only choice we have. Hello? Hello! Hello? Hello? Are you saying something? I love you. Come here. Hey. Hey there. Who is it? - Who is he? - Who? Who are you screwing behind my back? That dipshit Janek? Well, aren't you gonna say anything? Maciek. I heard you moaning with my own ears! Maciek, just calm down. You should've at least turned your fucking phone off! Turn on the camera! Hey! Turn on the camera right now! Turn on your fucking camera! I'm going to Iceland. But why? It's done. I want to tell him myself. Calm down. Can't you wait until he gets back? He's already found out about us. It was terrifying, his reaction. But it's okay. I need to end it now. I need to fly there. - Maybe just call him? - No, no. I don't want to do this over the phone. I'll go and come back. I've already bought tickets. I just wanted to let you know so you found out... So that you would know. - Hello? - Hello. - Hello. - Iceland Rescue Team here. - A man fell into a crevasse. - Got it. He seems to be unconscious. Yeah. Please don't do anything. Wait for the rescue team. I'll send you the GPS coordinates. - Can you stay there? - I can't. My wife's coming from Poland tonight. Hi. Joanna Ragnarsdottir. Icelandic Rescue Service. - Nina? - Yes? I came on behalf of your husband. He couldn't come here himself? Let me guess, he misjudged the time. Not exactly. Your husband witnessed an accident. He'll come back with the rescue team. If you'd follow me? - Are you from Poland? - Yes, I am. But I've lived here awhile. You can put your suitcase here in the backseat. My husband is Icelandic. We both work for the rescue service. We both like the adrenaline. I bet you don't have children. We do. Three of them. Three, five and seven. We take turns being the one on call. You stay with them all alone? Sure, and he stays with them alone when it's my turn to head out. That way, we can support each other's freedom. We're both happy with it. You know, Iceland usually ranks as the happiest nation in all of Europe. The divorce rate is also highest in Europe. Maybe that's the reason they're so happy. No one suffers in a bad relationship for the sake of the in-laws or children, so... We have to go to the hospital for... Your husband saved a man, but then he had an accident himself. Excuse me, do you know where reception is? Thank you. Hello. My name is Szklarska, and my husband is here. Is it possible to see him now? Mmm, no. Okay. So do you know the name of the doctor who I can talk with? Uh, Dr. Jallow. Okay. So, is it possible to talk with him now? - He'll be right out. - Okay. Thank you. I'll wait over here. Okay. Uh, hello. I believe you're treating my husband. Mrs. Szklarski? Yes. I wanted to ask about his condition. How is he? His condition is critical, but we do everything we can. He's undergoing examinations now. Isn't there anything else you could do? We have to wait, really. Okay. Thank you. Hey Nina! I'm glad you called. I couldn't focus on anything. So how did it go? Hang on. Your flight is arriving around four tomorrow, right? You know what? Don't tell me yet. Uh... I'll make us dinner. I bought everything you like. I got asparagus, uh, capers... Uh, I even got a couple oysters. You can tell me then. Janek, I'm staying here. What? Nina, I'm begging you, no! Nina. Do you hear me, Nina? Don't do this to us. You have to understand. I can't come back. No! Nina. Don't tell me, I don't want to know. Just tell me if this is your final decision. It is. But I... JANEK, I'M AT THE HOSPITAL... Hello? I'm sorry. I got emotional when we last spoke. I understand. It's okay. I just didn't want things to end this way. In anger. Some juice. You need the sugar. Janek, what are we gonna do? I'm scared. Maciek... He's still in there in a coma. I'll step back. So you have more space. For now. I will always be there. Right within your reach. Nina... Hospital... You've been in a coma. For four days. Come here. - Let me get the doctor. - Don't go. Wait. Wait. Can we just talk for a bit? I missed you so much. I figured it all out. Do you think that that's enough? Enough? I don't know. It's... one step. I still love you. I can't feel... I can't feel it. You can't move your hand at all? It'll be okay.
