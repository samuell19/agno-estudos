One second. I can't see. Please don't put them back on. The same thing keeps happening! I have to or I can't see a thing. You know. Come on, come here. Speaking of seeing... ...you must watch your step at the office... ...the rumour mill is a nightmare. Ah, rumours... you shouldn't worry about them. You know why? Because I happen to be the boss. That turned me on... Say it again. Say what? That I'm the boss? - I'm the f..g boss, darling. - Really? Yeah, and I'm up here... ...and common and mediocre people are under the ground. I am the f..g king of business... ...a f..g money printer machine... ...and I spend it in whatever the f..k I want. Do you fancy a week in the Bahamas? You'll have a week in the Bahamas... The company pays, my company. Because I am the boss and I do what I f..g want. And that is why I don't take my glasses off. Alright. Cool down. One second. But if you can do whatever you like... ...why don't you leave your wife? My wife has lost it. She looks nuts, now. I fear she kills herself if she finds out about this... What are you saying? If she does something stupid. I'll get custody of the kids. You don't want us to take care of them in the f..g Bahamas, right? Everything will work out fine, you'll see. I swear by my glasses. By your glasses, huh? - Juan, did you see that? - See what? I think someone took a photo of us. Already paranoid. I'm telling you! There's someone there. We must leave! Let's go! It doesn't start. Is that the police? - I am being... - We, Juan! We! We're being attacked by a criminal. - Me and... an acquaintance of mine. - Juan! Juan. Juan. Okay. Okay. How much do you want? You don't want money? All right, what do you want... ...a job? What I want is a little drama. Can you give me that? What? Yes, I'll give you drama. All right. Mari Carmen? What the f..k are you doing here with these guys? - Have they done anything to you? - Yes. - Yes, they have... - What have they done to you? They've made me see... ...you're a jerk... ...a moron, and a son of a b..h. What are you doing? Something I should have done... - ...a long time ago. - Okay, darling. I'm sorry. You're right, I made a mistake... ...but this won't happen again, believe me. What the hell are you doing? I told you I wanted drama! Please! Please, Mari Carmen! - Louder, scream! - I beg you! Think about the kids! What would they say if they saw us like this? - Juan. - What? Why don't you take off your glasses. I know you like them a lot and I don't want them to break. Take off your glasses. Right now. That's... That's much better. Son of a b..h. Why is this new app called Framed a revolution in the digital market? Internet has created an interconnected society... ...but the landing of Framed puts it a step further. With this new app, you can broadcast... ...live videos from anywhere in the world. Framed is available for all digital platforms and mobile devices... ...as long as you are connected to internet. From Bangkok, to Iceland, Angola, Alaska and even Hawaii. With Framed you'll never loose an important event again. Its audience measurement system allows you to know... ...how many viewers are watching this streaming. You already know that a lot of users... ...can attract thousands of people. You'll be able to see cooking lessons... ...or parties in live streaming. Framed has no limits. More audience means more viral action. But why is Framed generating so much controversy? Streamings with sex and violence get... ...higher audience rates in Framed... ...as it becomes a viral phenomenon. Framed has already shown some brutal aggressions... ...and organized terrorist attacks. We've also seen crimes of passion. All that available for an audience that doesn't seem to have enough. The question is:... ...what are the limits? The answer is not clear, and people seem to be eager... ...to do anything to become viral. Quite recently... ...we've seen the first example of a death... ...in our country shown in the app. That was Juan Navarro's case... ...killed by her own wife, Mari Carmen Gallegos... ...in what apparently was a crime of passion. We've also seen the case of Alba Gonz?lez... ...who's body was found in a car. The police is investigating the current events... Upload photos, you b..s. Upload photos. ...the autors of these crimes are still out there, somewhere... F..k. Alex! The TV isn't working again. Alex? - Alex. - Damn it, Claudia! Sorry. I like that frightened expression on your face. But. Alex. - What are you looking for? - The car keys. Let's see... Speak up. You must take me with you to the farewell party. - No way. - Why not? Alex, if you leave, it will kill me eventually. That again... My friends are at that dammed concert of my ex... ...and they won't stop uploading photos. Look! Look! It makes difference whether I look... ...20 post, 30 comments, 50 likes, 45 f..g messages... ...telling me that the concert is great while I'm here all alone. But do you have a boyfriend? "Had", Alex, had a boyfriend. Turn the mobile off and watch a movie. I can't. The TV is out of order, Alex. You're going to Berlin, right? I don't know... we've spend our whole live together... It feels as though you haven't thought... ...on how this would make me feel. Who am I going to scare now? Yoy're an idiot. You put a lot of efforts into this... ...but I am not taking you to the party. - Alex! - I said no, Claudia. Alright, it is a "no". How come you never told me you had a boyfriend? We live in the same apartment. If you used Facebook, you'd know. If you name all those social media networks... ...I swear I'll stop the car and throw you out. You're annoying, you really are. This will be the best night of my f..g life. Please, Claudia, try to be friendly and sociable. Wow. My brother's friends live in style. It is Sara's parents' house. Great. F..k. F..g dog! Let's go. It's open. Hello? We're here. Hey, man. Are you all right? Are you all right? F..k! You're a loser. What the f..k is going on here? - Your friend just smashed his face. - B..h. Sorry. He appeared from behind and I took him for a rapist. B..h. I can't feel my face. Careful, careful. Come on, man, it is not that bad. Are you ok? - How does it look? - It looks like... You had a menstruating vagina in the middle of your face... ...you know? Why didn't you do as I said? They heard me because you weren't making those noises! What noises? Okay. Listen carefully. Okay? Something like this. You're obsessed about recording scare cam. Recording scare cam? I record scare cams and upload them. I make a few bucks. You only have three subscribers:... ...your parents and a fake profile of your cat. Excuse me: I have 1,003 followers and rising. And my cat watches my videos, he's on his right to own an account. - What a faggot. - Hey dudes, who is this guy? And why is he wearing a disguise? - His name is Jonathan. - My name is Tom. Why are you disguised as if you were going Pok?mon hunting? I'm telling you this isn't a... ...disguise: it's my boy scout uniform. - Hey, what's the matter? - Ok, just ignore him. He's my cousin. If we all ignore him... ...it'll be as if he doesn't exist. I need another beer. Do you hear that? The dog is barking. Someone is coming. Okay? It's time for another scare cams! Jonathan, go back to the couch, quickly. - Come on man, not again. - It must be Bea and her friend. This time it's your turn to do the recording. Sara has Parkinson Disease level 5 from jerking off too many guys. Go hide, everyone, quickly! Now! Now! - Jonathan! - Tom, please. Okay, Tom... ...Tom, I want you to remember something... Make those f..g noises! F..k! Let's go to the kitchen. Alex, come on. Hello? Alex, frame their faces for a close up. Great. Great. Hello? Got him right in the face! - Alex, what the f..k is happening? - It was Javi's idea. He wants to record scare cams to make some money. Great. Aren't you going to introduce your friend to us? Ah, yes. Maurice this is the group. Group this is Maurice. Hi! Hello everybody. I'm delighted to be here. - You must be Alex, right? - Yes. Yes, that's right, I suppose Bea has told you about me. Not really. I know your name because... ...Bea mentioned it about 20 seconds ago. You're the guy who is leaving, aren't you? Well, not right now, I'm leaving tomorrow. Do you get me? I'm off to Berlin. To work. Finding a job here is... ...Job, work... Here, Spain... Work... Maurice is French but has been living in Spain for 10 years. You don't need to talk to him like he's a Chinese tourist. F..g French pig. - And what's your name? - Jonathan... - Tom. - I mean, Tom. Aren't you too young to drink? Didn't you know it's illegal? The only thing illegal here ought to be your name. It sounds more appropiate for a highway brothel. F..g hell, what a kid. Who raised him? Adolf Hitler? Excuse, but there's a guy who's being lying on the floor... What should I do? Keep recording him? Shove the dammed cell phone down his throat. I'm so sorry, pal, honestly. I went out and... - Does it hurt? - It's all right, Murray. Maurice... - My name is Maurice... - Ah, yeah, sorry. It's my head... spinning. Do you want to watch Framed? That website where people beat the s..t out of each other? No way! It's a website where anyone can upload whatever they want. It's pure creativity. I think this TV has internet. You'll see... you're going to love it. It's f..g gold. I don't know why you're still smoking. Is something wrong? - And again... - Your brow is furrowed. It's just that I wonder... ...why you've brought along f..g Ryan Gosling to my farewell party. I don't have a problem, everyone can do as they please... ...but do you want to turn my last night into a horror movie? Horror movies? Maurice! Actually... Alex was telling me about this really good film... What was it about? Ah... Yes, well... About a girl who is a bit crazy. One day she gets up... ...and decides to kill her boyfriend for no reason... ...then she builds a f..g robot... ...a tall strong robot. Tall, bit, strong and handsome, right? A perfect robot. The robot appears, smashes his way through the door shouting... ...he beats the guy in front of his friends... ...blood splashing all over the place. As he lies on the floor dying... ...he asks:... ..."Why did she choose to murder me like this?" This is more or less what it is about. Wow, man, what a great film! Bea, can you help me get some beer from the car? Yes. Now we put cream on the muffin and... What's up? Here we are! This is "Extreme Gastronomy"... ...and you know how it goes: the more the audience... ...the nastiest will be the things you'll see me eat. And... what is going on? How many people is watching me? 300,00 online users... What can I do? So I am going to eat a f..g roach. Alive! Are you guys ready? This is too much for me. It's chilly. Man, I've done it! I've done it! Did you like this? Okay, having reached 350.000 online users... ...you'll freak out, now... I am going to eat now... ...my own s..t! It doesn't smell nice, but I'm going to do it all the same... ..."Extreme gastronomy"! F..k, man. No! Don't eat your s..t, man! The small pieces are the worst of all. Hello... is anybody there? Amusement in somebody else's house Javi! What the f..k are you doing? Come and give us a hand getting dinner ready. I look awful here. And another one... ...Claudia, come in, dinner is ready. Let's go. We're working in Somalia, where infant mortality is very high. We've managed to set up internet access in several villages... ...and the children there have put their profiles on social media... ...and can now explain their problems to the world. Wow. We are making people aware of what's happening over there. Yes. We're waiting for the TV to grant us a slot... And... what do they post? Mom, I got 300 likes today and I have malaria now... XD XD Javi, you're so funny... It was a f..g joke. Sorry. What's amazing is what I accomplished this week:... ...30,000 subscribers to my YouTube channel. You're such a show- off. People only view your videos when you show your boobies. You're a resentful b..d, but it doesn't matter. Yes, I am. Thank you. Hey dudes, have you noticed... ...that most of our jobs, apart from Alex's... ...are focused on being as viral as possible. Even the black children in Africa are getting into social media... ...through Maurice's NGO. The important thing in today's... ...world are the labelling, followers... - ...trending topics, likes... - Yes, so what? All of them are intangibles. The only thing that matters is what happens in cyberspace. The time will come when our personality begins... ...and our viral existence ends. That will be a real f..g mess! You won't exist without internet. You know what Alex's problem is? He's not on social media... ...and people keep asking me if he is dead... ...or if something bad has happened to him. I swear. Really? And it's because Web 2.0 has become reality. I don't know... ...I sometimes think, I ask myself... ...that simply we... I need to pee! Bye, Javi. For a moment I thought he wasn't a jerk. I'm going to get more food, something physical, not viral. Toby? Sara, are you okay? I hope she isn't hurt. Sara, what happened? Someone killed my... We should call the cops... Yes, please... right now! No, sorry guys but I think we should go outside... ...and beat the hell out of that mother f..r. After that, we'll phone the police if you want. Excuse me? I don't think I understood... Do you know what can legally happen when a person kills a dog? Nothing. But we can give that b..d a good beating. - Who's with me? - Stop it! Every time that we go out, you just lose it! Alex, can you see anything? Hi! Stop clowning around. What happened out there? Maurice? Who is Maurice? That's not my name. Where is the knife? Somebody call an ambulance! - F..k. - No, Maurice... ...please don't touch your head! - Bea. - What? I can't feel my legs. - Did you find the knife? - Don't worry about the knife. Bea, may I sing. Sure. - This phone doesn't work. - Mine doesn't either. What the f..k is going on? Alex. Alex, we're in Framed! Stop! What do you think you're doing? Playing with my new toy. But if you use it like that, you'll break it. - So, what? - Don't you see? Usually, toys don't sing when they get... ...stabbed in the head with a knife. Nobody, I'll say it again, nobody screws up... ...any f..g toys when they're new. But... It makes no sense at all. Can't you warm me in some normal way? Do you know where Claudia is? S..t! It's locked. I am sure there is another way out. I'm sure. Ok. We're online. Good evening, dear viewers! You must be thinking: "who the f..k is this guy?" My name is not relevant here. Some months ago, I started hearing voices inside my head. Actually, it wasn't one voice... ...it was hundreds of millions. Can you imagine? Talking non-stop, all day and night. Until one day I woke up... ...and all the voices... ...had become one... One f..g huge voice. That voice told me it was internet. Internet spoke to me! God chose Jesus Christ for his big plan. Internet has chosen me for its own plan. Because of that, tonight is going to be very special. Dear viewers, tonight I'm going to give to internet... ...what it's been asking from me for such a long time. Don't miss out the best show in the world! Welcome to "Amusement in Somebody else's House"! Alex, is that you? How the hell did they block the phone? My mother is the manager of a bank. Stop, stop. I like that idea. She can give you as much money as you want. Okay, okay, okay. This is what we want. Mission accomplished, right? - Yes. - Yes. I don't want your money. I want you to sing! Now. Sing. What the f..k are you doing? I want you to sing the "Ode to Joy". Help him! Have you finished? You've killed my dog, m..s. Well done, Bubba! Well done! But don't put anymore underwear on your head. That's weird, okay? - And now, go find the others. - Bubba, yum yum. Remember, don't kill anyone. I want them all alive. Otherwise no more yum yum for you. Understood? I'll get straight to the point: you two must f..k. What? Sorry, I think I didn't make myself clear. You two are going to f..k. It's a f..g order, you'll f..k and we'll stream it live. Otherwise, my friend here will slice you with the grinder. What do you prefer: to screw or getting totally screwed? Sara, listen to me. - Maybe... - No. Listen, between you and me. If you want to survive, you've to trust me. Okay? Great. Go on, take off your clothes. Now. Smile. More. Tell him you're horny. Tell him! I am really horny... Say it again... What are they doing? They get Sara and Javi, but they force them to f..k. This is f..g strange. What do you think they'll do if they get us? Nothing, I don't want to be in their "film". I'm afraid we're already in it. No, no, this is b..t. I want more passion. Yeah. And you should move a little, right? - You look like a horny otter. - Shut up and follow me! Come on, f..k! Stop, stop. We'll continue on a more "instinctive" level. Open your mouth. - What are you doing? - Open your mouth. Come on! Swallow it... Swallow it... Good girl. You can go on f..g him. Are you all right? Come on! Come on, Sara. What happened? What are you doing? Don't you dare go outside. - What do you suggest I should do? - Stay here and wait. Really? Alex, if you go outside... ...they'll catch you and they'll slaughter you. Maybe... But I have to protect Claudia. A..e! I think I can squeeze through here. I might make it to the lower floor. Are you sure it's a good idea? Of course, it isn't. It's a lousy idea. The survival manual is very clear:... ...if possible, one must act. F..k. If I don't make it, I want you to tell my mother something. I'll tell her you love her, don't worry. Come on. No. Tell her to go f..k herself. Ok... Mom? Yes... ...I'm mom... ...and your snack is ready. Great. Start streaming. Is she dying? Breaking news: Spain has been shaken... ...by one of the Framed live streaming channels, called:... ..."Amusement in Somebody else's House". This streaming has been counting his spectators by the millions... ...while the people in the house are... ...victims of torture and aggression. All is being broadcasted live, as we have already said. Claudia. We must get out of here. The police have not yet been able to track the location... ...but we hope they'll do in no time. The streaming has shown atrocious scenes... ...carried out by the perpetrators. This channel has the intention to keep you up to date... ...about all the developments of this story. We'll do something extraordinary that hasn't been done before on TV. We are going live to "Amusement in Somebody else's House". My colleagues have informed me that we are live already. We see a man sitting on a sofa... ...but we don't know if he is alive. Is that me? He can speak. Thank God, he's alive. One moment... ...the victim appears in a live recording... ...so one of the authors of the video might be around. Hi. Is he saying hi? Millions of people are watching you right now. Do you want to say something? The house's address. Say it. Come on, say it. What? Each year... Millions of children in Africa die from hunger... What? ...but we've been able to install internet in villages... ...and now children... ...have profiles in various social media... ...and can explain their problems to the world. Why the f..k are you talking about the dammed children in Africa? You're f..g crazy. I need to provide some entertainment for the public. The viewers must remain glued to the screen... ...hooked. You understand, right? You are my running gag. Do you know what this is? No, no, no. This... What is he doing? - You didn't feel anything? - Is that good or bad? - Or is it bad? - Very bad. Please, let's stop this now, this is too much. Please, producers, cut the connection. I need you to scream. Ok, look at me. Oh, no! What is he sticking in his ear? This is terrible. Just one moment... ...the audience is on the rise. You mustn't cry, damn it, you have to scream. I am crying because I don't feel anything. All right... concentrate. What part of your body can you feel? My eyes. - Eyes. - Yes. We've just reached 6 million viewers. F..k. This is horrific! How is that f..g s..t? The s..t is... This s..t looks exactly the same. What is she doing? I can't belive this. F..k! She's devouring herself. I'm sorry, buddy. - S..t, Bea. - Are you Okay? - We must leave, now. - Yes. No, no... We can't leave Maurice here. Haven't you seen what they've done to him? I have no battery left. What's happened? How is he? He's alive, right? Alex. Bea. - Maurice... - Maurice is alive. He's good. Apart from the knife in her head and his hands... he's good. Thank God! No... No... No... Dead. If dead... ...no yum, yum... ...for Bubba! No! No! No! Bubba wanted yum yum... Bubba wanted yum yum... I'll kill you, son of a b..h! Bea. Did you hear that? Stay still. It is just an injection. I'll give you a lollipop when we're done. Stop. Don't move, for f..k's sake. And now, run. Do you know what? No more yum yum for you. No yum yum, Bubba no play. What a pity! Apparently, our young guest doesn't wish to leave the party. Of course, we're really enjoying ourselves here. Isn't it? Lucy. The time has come. No. We'll let luck decide. - What's going on? Are you a coward? - No. That's why Santa didn't get you any presents. Lucy says tails. Cool. F..k. S..t. F..k, it's heads. Turn around. I have injected you whith a drug called burundanga. What does it mean? From now on I will control your body. Hey, boy. Slap your own face. Now. Harder. Harder. Harder, more, more! Harder! Sara? Are you all right? Sara? Do you hear me? Do it now. Harder. Sara? Do you hear me? Sara... Alex! No... No... Bubba... ...just wanted... ...yum yum. Claudia. Claudia... It's me. Hello. Who the f..k are you? I am the wrong guy in the right place. Or the right guy in the wrong place. I am not sure. Bea. Relax. I'm not going to kill you. I just want both of us to have a good time. F..k you! It was a two headed coin. Lucy and I have been tricked. By you. - And we don't like it! - Look at me, look at me! - You caught me. You know what? - You must apologize to Lucy. I'm sorry Lucy... You are so important to me. Lucy just said she wants to play a grater role in our show... ...I already knew that! I'll give it to her. You never understood the essence of my show. Claudia. Stay here, I am going to kill that son of a b..h. I know you're there. Watching. And I also know you're angry. Your friend shouldn't have died like that. It was a disrespectful act. For you, for me... ...but above all, for the viewers. Good, you're looking for me. Do you like music? I really love music. You and I have things in common. You must admit that was a good one, huh? I'm right behind you. No way, man. Do you really think if I had been behind you I would have told you? Come on... Now I am behind you, really. Such a great moment. You are going to die. The police is working hard on trying to locate the place... ...from which the horrific scenes shown... ...on Framed are being broadcasted. We are begging all viewers if you have any information... ...please share it with us calling at the phone shown on screen. I had forgotten completely about you. The show must go on. So, you've arrived. Cool. Now go inside. Hey guys, you'd better come over. Okay. Sir, are you all right? I want you to listen carefully and do the following. - What the f..k is going on? - I don't know. F..k. Drop your weapon and get down on your knees now! What? What's the matter with you now? Help. Stop! No! No! No! You, retarded b..s! Must I do everything myself? I'm the citizen who's becoming famous by killing other citizens... ...and releasing the murders online so... ...that other citizens can watch them. Does it ring any bells with you guys? The boy had to go inside the police station... ...and write the house's address... ...using his blood. Why the hell did you shoot the stupid kid? It occurred to me that giving you the address is the best idea now. I am sending you the location, so that you don't get lost. Send the Special Operation Forces! You don't have time to spare. The time is coming. The coordinates for "Amusement in Somebody else's House" have been posted on internet and... ...as you can see, the exterior... ...of the house is full of onlookers... The audience is reaching unbelievable rates. Everyone is waiting for it to be activated again... ...when the Special Operations intervene... We're reaching the main entrance. Ready to access in 3,2,1... Warhol said that... ...everyone deserves 15 minutes of fame in a lifetime. You and me have had more than that... What do you think about it? Getting inside. Checking the first floor. F..g unbelievable! The Special Forces! The Special Forces are here! I love them! They shoot first and then they ask questions. This is going to be... ...epic. Checking the second floor. Bend down and raise your hands! To the ground, now. They shot your friend, just like that. They'll massacre us! Alex. Alex, please! - No, no, no... - Alex. Your brother is dead. The only thing I want is you to get me some more viewers. Come on, shout, scream! We'll make it epic! Help! Help! Aren't you going to plead for your life? Well... ...I think they're near. What the f..k is this? Vous ?tes une mauvaise personne! Stay right there! Don't come any closer. Stop there! You'll ruin our moment. Stay there! Wait, wait. Delta here, we've a survivor. Successfully completed removal. Time to leave. It's been 12 hours since... ...the end of "Amusement in Somebody... ...else's House" broadcasting. The main suspect, whose identity... ...is still unknown, was stabbed to death... ...at the same time the streaming had... ...it's global online audience record. 30 millions of people saw his death live. The news has swept the world in a record time frame. In Japan, the streaming was even broadcasted... ...from different buildings in the capital city. The reaction on internet has been amazing. "Buba yum yum" became trending topic... ...and now the face of the main suspect... ...appears everywhere in social media. Many internet users belive this is a hoax but... ...a police investigation is trying to dig into this case. Last night was, without a doubt... ...one of the most turbulent nights since the birth of internet. 3G Channel will keep you updated with latest news. Hi, Claudia. Are you any better? I'm inspector Alcazar. I am sorry but I need to ask you some questions. - I am very tired. - It won't take long, okay? I guess you know it already, but you are famous. It is important to have a recorded declaration... ...about everything that happened. Unfortunately, the other survivor cannot talk. Another survivor? His name is Maurice. Do you know him? He's still alive. Claudia, I am here to help you, you must explain to me what happened. Everything. We were all having dinner... all of us. Two of them came in through the kitchen... ...I don't know about the third one... ...perhaps he was already inside. And they got all of us, one by one... ...and they tortured us. They recorded everything with their cameras. My brother... What are you laughing about? Sorry, what? Do you think it's funny or something? Claudia. I know you're suffering from... ...some sort of post-traumatic stress... ...but I need you to tell me everything you can remember... ...any thought, any detail is important. Say hello to the audience!
