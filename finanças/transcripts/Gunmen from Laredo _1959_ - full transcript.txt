Looks like you're traveling in style. This is the life I sure with the weather would make up its mind. So do I. JARO: This is a very stubborn wheel. GIL: Like my wife, Jaro. A team of mules couldn't have kept her home. But she is not stubborn, Amigo. She is a very brave woman. I don't see how you figure. This has been a great opportunity for her to see the country. Free transportation, free room and meals. The room is an old tent, and the good meals would be not good without her cooking them. Oh, cooking's no problem. Don't I always dry the dishes? Si.After she washes them. [CHUCKLES]And there's another reason why she is brave. She marry you. Oh, that makes her brave? To marry a man makes any woman brave. Well, don't let her hear you or I'll have to raise her wages. The only raise I want is another cushion. I could even use two more. How much farther is it to the Laredo cutoff? Just over the next hill. We'll water the herd and camp there tonight. Maybe make San Antonio tomorrow. I hope so. Oh, Fierre is right. You are a brave girl. A most beautiful brave girl. With sand in my hair, freckles on my nose and a ton of mud under my fingernails, you must be crazy. Yep, really crazy, about you. Sure like the way you talk, mister. Well, it's been a long hard trip. Soon be over. Laredo would have been much easier, wouldn't it Gil? We'd probably be there by now. It's just as well to go around it this way. We'll find a buyer for the herd in San Antonio. You wouldn't be avoiding Laredo because I happen to be along, would you? I would. There's a man there by the name of Keefer. He and his brothers run the cattle market. So we could sell the cattle. No, not to Ben Keefer. I was in a cattle deal with him once before. It broke up with a little gun play. One of his men was killed. Oh? Oh, it was a fair fight but Keefer couldn't believe it that way. He made a few threats and if we meet again, I know there'll be more shooting. Look, Katy, we've had two good years together. I've been able to get by without getting into any trouble. I'd kind of like to keep it that way. Onward to San Antonio.[CHUCKLES] How much longer are we gonna wait? They'll be along soon. This rain won't stop them. You're sure going to a heap of trouble just to knock off a couple of hundred head of cattle ain't ya? You think I rode all the way out here just for that? That's all you told me. Well, Bob, I had a run in with this fellow once. Name's Reardon. A friend of mine got shot. I don't like my friends getting shot. Understand? We knock off the cattle and we knock off the people. Maybe they won't show. Bringing that herd in all the way from Mexico, they could go in any direction. Jordon? I told you I saw 'em cross the Rio Grande early this morning. They're passing up Laredo and heading for San Antonio. They gotta come through here. With a circuit judge in town, ain't you got enough worries? This is not going to be any worry. [COWS MOOING] [COWBOYS HERDING] KATY: The cattle will be glad to get a drink. Their last chance at water for miles. Jaro! We'll camp on the other side. Hold the herd here until I check the creek bottom. Don't want to run into any soft spots. Si. Be careful, Mister Reardon. I will, Mrs. Reardon. Let's go. [SOFTLY] Hee-yah! [AD LIB YELLS TO CATTLE] [GUNSHOT ECHOES] Hee-yah! Hee-yah! [COUGHS] [SIGHS] Jaro! Katy! Katy! Katy! [PANTING] Katy! Katy, Katy! Katy, Katy![GASPS] Gil... Gil you're, you're here. Oh, Katy! Gil... hold me [DOG BARKING] [PEOPLE CHATTERING] You looking for somebody? Ben Keefer. Well, he's busy. Maybe his brothers can accommodate you. I said I was looking for Ben. If you want to see him you'll have to wait. Now get out of my way! Why you... Now hold it right there! Both of you! Now where's your brave brother? BEN: You looking for me, Reardon? Hold that gun right where it is. I don't think you'll be needing this anymore. Well, you don't show much surprise. Should I? Well, most people would. What are you talking about? Well, thanks for leaving me alive, but you didn't draw the line at killing a defenseless woman, did you? You making up some kind of story? I don't have to make one up. Oh, you slipped up on me, Ben, and you're going to be sorry you did right up to the hour I kill you. I told you once before there's wasn't room enough in the same territory for both of us. I never thought you'd make it this easy for me. Reardon, you made it real easy. Why, half the people in this room saw him try to draw on me. [MUTTERING]They did? That's an interesting way to look at it. Sutton's gun never even left its holster. You made sure he didn't have any chance at all, didn't you? Chance? Did the two you killed a few hours ago have a chance? Aren't you a little mixed up? I've been working upstairs in my office all night. There are witnesses here that can prove that. You're a liar, Keefer. You were at the Laredo cut-off just before sundown. And you left me for dead after you murdered my wife. Talks kinda crazy, doesn't he? Shoots kinda crazy, too. You and your brothers... Huh, you got it all figured, haven't you? There's a circuit judge due here tomorrow. You tell him your story. We'll tell him ours. [PEOPLE CHATTERING] [PEOPLE CLAMORING] Close that bar and let's get this trial started. BEN: Archie, close it! You men, I picked for the jury leave your drinks and sit over here. [CHATTER] This Circuit Court with Judge Raymond Parker presiding is now in session. Juryman, take off you hats. I've been mixing around a little this morning, now and then overhearing about favoritism and certain conditions existing in this town that might affect the trial. Want to say right from the start, there's no favoritism, no conditions' in this court of law. We're going to have a fair trial. A man is dead, and if the jury finds Gil Reardon guilty of murder, as charged, he's going to be punished. He's going to be sentenced according to the law. You understand that Mr. Reardon? I do. And, if the jury finds the accused innocent, he is to be set free. Understand that, Mister Keefer? I do. There's no doubt about his guilt. Uh, we've got a jury here to decide that. You understand your duties, Jury?[CHATTER] You men of the jury, will you stop gabbing and listen to what I have to say. Oh, we're listening, Judge. You've got to decide if what the witnesses swear to is the truth or if what the defendant swears to is the truth. We know all that, Judge. Swear 'em in and let 'em start talking. Well, I've got something else to say, first. I told a few of you what's in this envelope. It's papers, giving this district a United States Marshal. I want to say that I recommended the appointment. Some of you've already met the gentlemen. He's a good man. He's honest. Stand up, Matt. Matt Crawford. Now, I, I don't become a representative of the law here until tomorrow. But there is just one thing I'd like to mention, in advance while we're all friends. [LAUGHING]If you don't want trouble keep out of trouble.[LAUGHS] Well that goes for you, too, Marshal. If you don't want trouble, keep out of it. That right, boys? Mister Keefer, everybody here... When there's trouble I don't keep out of it. I get in it, with both feet. All right, Marshal, all right. You can make more speeches tomorrow on your own time. The first man to be heard in this case is Ben Keefer who makes the charges. Step up, Mister Keefer, and be sworn in. [CROWD MURMURING] Do you promise to tell the truth, the whole truth and abide by the verdict of this Court so help you God? I do. Your charge is that Gil Reardon came into this saloon yesterday and shot Bob Sutton in cold blood, killed him. BEN: That's right, Judge, and with witnesses to prove it. All right, Judge, we're ready. Everybody sit down now. The Court is open again. Everybody sit. You men got a verdict? Yes, sir. What is it? We listened to all that's been said and sworn to very careful, Judge, and we all agree on guilty. JUDGE: I have no choice but to accept the findings of the jury. Namely, that you, Gil Reardon, did shoot and kill one Bob Sutton without reasonable cause or provocation. Now what kind of a trial is this? A fair one, Mister Reardon, a fair one. You had your say. Oh, I had my say, but I don't think anyone heard it. Well, why didn't you get answers to the questions I brought up? Questions don't count. You've got to have evidence, and you haven't any. All you had was charges and no witnesses. And all you had is the story of three brothers who would lie, steal or kill for each other. Mister Reardon, the men on this jury tried you, I didn't. They heard everything you said and they heard everything the Keefer said, and all agree that you're guilty. I can't fight that, and neither can you. [MURMURING] Quiet! To this charge and specification as heard here today, you, Gil Reardon, are hereby sentenced to not loss that 10 nor more than 25 years in the Territorial Prison at Unionville, New Mexico. [CROWD CHATTERING][STRIKES HAMMER] This court is adjourned. Everybody to the bar! Drinks are free for an hour. [PEOPLE CHEER] I guess you can start your job a day earlier than you expected, Marshal. I'll turn Reardon over to you now. You'll have to deliver him to the Unionville Prison. Uh, oh, Reardon, I'm sorry about you wife. Ten to 25 years. That's a long time. I'm really sorry. I couldn't help it. So long, Marshal. I'm innocent, Marshal. Too bad you didn't have more proof on your side. Could that mean you believe me? All I said was it's too bad you haven't got more proof. Well, you stay here long enough, you may run into some of that proof. This town really needs a cleaning, Marshal. If this town needs it, I'll clean it up. Too late to do me any good. [PEOPLE CHATTERING] [THUNDER] MAN: ♪♪♪ Nobody knows the trouble I've seen ♪♪♪ Nobody knows but Jesus[SCRAPING] ♪♪♪ Nobody knows the trouble I've seen ♪♪♪ Glory hallelujah ♪♪♪ Again, Smokey.♪♪♪ Nobody knows the trouble...♪♪♪ BOWDRE: Sing something else, will you? That song's driving me crazy. Mister Gil... Yeah? I can't sing no more. I'm worried. They'll shoot you down dead. Shut that talk. It's true. Those guards can see in the dark. Like big owls, with big eyes. Will you shut up? Oh, leave him alone. Him and you! I ain't waiting no longer. We waited so long we'll get caught. Reardon did solitary for me once. I'm not leaving him this way. They find him with this iron half cut he's as good as dead. So you do make it. Laredo's a long ways off. Talking, talking. Minutes more. Just minutes. When we're over the wall, we go separate. Understand? You go any way you want to. I promised Reardon I'd get him to Laredo. He can't' find his way across that stinking desert without me. [GRUNTS] I wish you were coming with us. There's nothing on the outside for me, nothing. Goodbye, Smokey. [THUNDER][WIND HOWLING] Look! How bad is it? Looks like three of them heading towards the fence. We got two of them. One went over. Let him go. He'll run into his own hell. He can't cross the first wash in this. If he does he'll never get by the Apaches. That'll be tough to do. WOMAN: [STRUGGLING] [SIGHS] I know you are from prison. They keep you with iron chains. How you go free? Well, let's talk about you first. How'd you get tied up? Where'd you learn to speak English? I go to Reservation school. I'm Mescaleros. Apache Mescaleros. You're no Indian, you're Mexican. I was Mexican when I was very small. Before I was stolen. But I'm Mescaleros Indian now. I'm too tired to argue. Well, how'd you get in this fix? I did not come freely. [CHUCKLES] I can believe that. The Chiricahuas. Three days ago, Delgados, the son of his chief, he steal me. Well, this is some way to spend a honeymoon. I know what that means. No honeymoon. ROSITA: I hate Delgados. I fight him. He tie me here while he go hunting. [SCREECHING] [BOTH GRUNTING] [GRUNTING] [GROANS] Good. This was Delgados? Yes. Now I am free. What do they call you? Natahna.Natahna. There is a Mexican name, I like. Oh? Rosita.Rosita. Yeah, that fits better. Rosita. It's more Mexican. Uh, pretty Mexican, too. Where'd the army saddles come from? Delgados steal them before he steal me. He's taken this right out of a fort. Chircahua dogs sneak like coyotes at night. Yeah. Sure, sure. Oh, I could stand fresh clothes and a cleaning up. Now do I have to tie you to a tree? No.You won't run away? No. I like you. I am glad we are alone. I will fix food. [HORSE SNORTS] You know the country well? Very well. I ride all over with Mescalero's until I go to reservation school. Until Delgados steal me. Delgados, Chirichaua dog! Have you ever been that way? You have not? Let's say I haven't been over that part. That is bad way. Some rock, big canyon not much water. Desert God make big storm this time of year. Oh, you believe in Desert Gods now, huh? I know them best. That is bad way. You come with Rosita. My village not many days away. Enough food in saddle. My father make you big friend. Check your canteen, we'll get started. We find plenty of water on the way to my village. Well, we're heading that way to the Texas line. Tejano? Check you canteen! Now I don't like you. I'm sorry you find me. Well, that can be taken care of. I've got an appointment in Laredo. You just got me across those hills and you're on your own. This is no good. The Chiricahuas hate Mescalaros. If the Chiricahuas find the son of their chief dead, Coloradas himself will follow our trail. Better we go to my village. Now do you get up there alone, or do I tie you on? And don't get any runaway ideas. I'll shoot your horse down if I have to. Now the sooner we get to Laredo the sooner you can get back to your people. Now, get up there. I was told this uh, this crossing shouldn't take more than five or six days. You see that it doesn't. Head down there. That water will keep our tracks covered for a while. [SPEAKING IN NATIVE AMERICAN] Delgados. [PEOPLE MURMURING] [SPEAKING IN NATIVE AMERICAN] MEN: [EXCLAIMING] Well? No use, Matt. Ben Keefer's too smart to do his own dirty work. He's got five witnesses that'll swear he was twenty miles away from that shooting last night. I've been a lot of places, Dave, the smart hombres all make mistakes. Just a question of time. Time! Marshal, you've been here over four months and I've been here three. That Keefer stranglehold is getting stronger. Could be if it gets too tight it might break of its own accord. Hmm, or break us. Take it easy, Dave. Just keep your hook baited, and be patient. Fish bound to get hungry sooner or later they'll bite. I want Ben Keefer for sure, the brothers I can hope for, but I want Ben cornered. I want him dead to rights. Well, that's a pretty big order. He's cagey. We've got us another worry here. Telegraph operator delivered this message while you were out. Gil Reardon escaped from the Unionville Prison. How? It doesn't say. It's from Captain Garrick, the Prison Superintendent. What's he mean, if Reardon lived through a cloudburst he thinks he'll come here? I reckon he remembers all the facts of the trial. When I delivered Reardon to him we talked it over. Why a man would have to be loco to try coming across that desert. When a man's got a solid reason of getting somewhere, he might go loco trying to get there. Marshall, you heard Reardon in court. What do you think now of his story? Just what I thought then. I wish he'd had more proof to back it up. Then you do believe him. Just what you said. The Keefers are smart hombres. They know how to tighten a stranglehold. Well, if I were in Reardon's shoes, I'd be high-tailing it far away from here not looking for trouble. Would you? Yes, I would. If you loved your wife and you knew who killed her and where you could find him, would you high-tail it away? Well, I... Well, Ben Keefer and I are having a few drinks one night. Enough to loosen his tongue a little. He said he first met Reardon in Dodge. They had a little run in of some kind. Right after that he heard that Reardon got married and left Dodge. Ben thought he had hung up his guns and settled down somewhere in Texas. Better if he had. Trying to cross that desert, well... I think we can start watching for him. Well, these Apaches don't want any white man on my part of their land, dead or alive. Well, even if he does get here, he couldn't do anything against those Keefers. Reardon's the kind who always plays showdown. Cards on the table face up, one draw. One winner. One loser, huh? That's right. That's right. Well, I think I'll break the good news to somebody. A worrying man might worry himself into making mistakes. And mistakes might just speed up breaking that stranglehold that uh, you were talking about. Well, it's always a pleasure to see a United States Marshal in here. What can I do for you Matt? Drink? I'll have a beer. Maybe he's got another closing order he can't' make stick. When I can prove your extra activities I'll make that closing order stick. You know, Marshal, when you first came to Laredo, I thought I was going to like ya. You seemed to have a lot of sense, even for a lawman. You're making me change my mind. Want to know something, Ben? You may have to change it right back again. I just had a message from the prison superintendent at Unionville Prison. Should that interest me? Gil Reardon's heading for Laredo. Coming across the desert. You add it up. Coming across the desert, huh? He'll never make it. I thought he had at least ten more years to do in that lock up? The walls weren't high enough. It's up to the law to nail him. It's your job to get... Don't you ever tell me what my job is? Now just a minute. And don't you, "Just a minute me". Remember, Ben, a rattler can got stopped on permanently if a man's fast enough. Nah. [HORSE NEIGHING] Rosita, you got to get down. [HORSE NEIGHS] Give him a mile or so to find out he isn't lame any longer. Which way to that ledge you told me about in the water? That way in big canyon, four or five hour's maybe. The Chiricahuas. Better we had gone to my village. Coloradas will never give up our trial. We've got a good start. Maybe we can hold it. Rosita, you ride my horse. I'll lead yours until he knows he can carry some weight. Indian would make Rosita walk. I know. Now, get up on mine. I want to make that ledge before dark. Water is up there. Why you trust me like this? Because you don't like Chiricahuas any more than I do. That is true. But how you know I not lead you around the desert, and not straight across it? Rosita had a wish to do that. Sometimes people just know things about other people without knowing the reasons. Sometimes I know things too. And the reasons. I go first. Why do you run from law? It's a long story. This man you look for in Laredo. He help you to be free of law? Not quite. I might get in deeper. Why? You go to kill him? Because of your woman? My woman as you call her, is dead! I'm glad. It's right to be honest. I say I am glad. I am. Is it wrong? I say what I think. Like... Like we are here alone. And I am glad. Are you? I haven't given it a thought. That is not honest. That is not true. I see your eyes, they talk to me. You look at me sometimes like... Like a man looks at his woman. Like you want me for... Why can't you talk about something else? About the prison? No! About the man in Laredo, the man you hate. Hate is no good, Gil. It eats in here. It changes a good spirit. The law no follow us across the Mexican border. We will go. I know the way. To what? To tomorrow. Tomorrow with no running away. Rosita had hate too. Now, no good to remember. If I can change, Gil can change. There's some things a man has to do if he's going to live with himself no matter where.[NEIGHING] [HORSES WHINNY] Better see what's bothering them. Not Apaches. It's the Storm God. Animals always know. The Chisera. Chisera? What's that? It is evil. Tomorrow the sun will hide. The sky will turn black. And the devil wind will come. Ah! Tomorrow it will come. You will see. It can mean death. Better we stay here.[WIND HOWLING] Devil wind come. It will blow hard. Have to chance it. To Laredo? That's it. And if I do not go on? I've heard what Chiricahuas do to Indian girls they find with white men. [WIND HOWLING] [NEIGHING] [SPEAKING IN NATIVE AMERICAN] [SPEAKING IN NATIVE AMERICAN] [SPEAKING IN NATIVE AMERICAN] [SHOUTING] We've got to find cover. Down there! There is a cave. [HORSE WHINNIES] [SIGHS] No, Gil, no. You don't want to kiss me? Yes, yes, but just because I kiss you does not... I be good woman for you. But afraid... Of what? I always be honest. Indians or white man can love many times. But not Rosita. I want to love for real. Only once... Only one man. Don't be afraid. Well? Thought you'd be back yesterday. Couldn't make it. You can forget all about Reardon. Nothing to worry about now. Good. How'd you do it? We ran into one of them, storms. Must have choked everything in the desert and in the foothills, too. First a rain and then one of them Chisera winds. Couldn't see my hand, couldn't see my horse. I could hardly breathe. That Reardon's out of our hair for good. Uh-uh. He is, huh? Where were you during this terrible storm? We holed up. Holed up, huh? Could Reardon have done the same? Why, not a chance! Besides, we had horses and water. Did you see him dead? No, but... I made that same mistake myself once, remember? Yeah, but we couldn't live through that storm. Nobody could. I told you two dumb heads to make sure, well what are you sure of? A lousy stinking sandstorm that you lived through, didn't you? So could he. You two, better figure a way of posting a lookout. Because if Reardon's alive, he'll be coming in. Glad you're along, Bass. You make best coffee. What do you aim to do, Matt? If Reardon did get through the Chisera, its' been three days. We're not going to catch him sitting here. Dave, you'll be old before your time. First, you figure what you'd do in the other fella's shoes. Then you sit in the middle of the road and wait. Oh, but Matt... Save a lot of wear and tear, too, son, on man and horse. He'll be coming this way. You know, it might not be too bad if he was to slip past us. That wouldn't be much to our credit. No, but it might just be a fighting chance for Laredo to get rid of the Keefers. If we see Reardon, we'll take him in. You've got the first watch, Bass. Then you, Dave. Rouse me at three for my turn. Texas foothills. Gil, just once more I ask you to... No, it has to be this way. I'm just like an Indian squaw to you. I've got a job to finish. I told you. And if you finish it, they take you back to prison. It proves nothing. You throw our life together, away. Our life together? Would that be wrong now? A man's got to live with himself first, or he isn't good for anybody. Well, maybe someday... Maybe you'll be dead, too. Maybe! I go with you. I help. You're going home where it's safe. The Chiricahuas don't want you. It's me the Chief wants. I go with you. No! Now, you're, you're a good guide, Rosita and thanks for getting me this far but from here on in I go alone. Now we're through. We're finished. You go back to your home. [GALLOPING] Now where do you think you're going? This isn't the way to your village. I was lost! You were not! All right. I were not! Go ahead. Tie me to the horse if you think so little of me. Now what am I going to do with you? I could tell you what you would do, but you will not do it. I have told you and you will not do it. No! [SIGHS] Well, what are you going to do, Rosita, sit up there all day? [LAUGHS]MATT: Hold it, Reardon! Don't do anything foolish, son. You're covered. Well, the new Marshal right on the job. When there's trouble he jumps in with both feet. Take it, Bass. Picked yourself a pretty good looking companion. Ah, I should have figured this. I'm glad you didn't. You saved me a heap of trouble. I don't mean this ambush. I should of figured the law is still doing Keefer's dirty work. I'll pass that for now, Reardon. Let's see if these fit. No! Rosita! Rosita! No! No! Leave her alone. I made her show me the way. No! Where'd you pick her up? Tied to a tree. With a sign hanging above her reading, 'Help yourself'? Now give me time, Marshal. I'll try and think of something better. Check her saddlebags for grub. If she hasn't got any give her some of ours. We'll send her on her way. Can we have a couple of minutes together? Yeah. I was right. I should have taken you to the border. No, it's better this way. Bring up their horses, Dave. We've got to make that old stagecoach station before dark. We've got plenty of water. Give her one of our extra canteens. Yeah, she'll need it. You'll be happier with your people. No. I belong with you. It has to be this way, Rosita. [SPEAKING IN NATIVE AMERICAN] [SPEAKING IN NATIVE AMERICAN] Hee-yah! Hee-yah! Hee-yah! There you are. [SIGHS] I can't figure you, Reardon. You'd of been a lot smarter to head for the border. The law will take care of the Keefers. Sooner or later... I thought maybe I could speed things up a little. How much extra time will I get for the breakout? You ought to quit thinking about Keefer. Quit remembering about your wife, too. It'll all even off, somewhere. It always does. Be a lot smarter to wash it out of your system. Put it all behind you. I would have, after ten minutes in Laredo. I'll slip those off if I get your word. That Rosita... She an Indian girl gone Mexican or Mexican girl gone Indian? A little of both. Seemed like a nice girl, too. All for you. Is that what she said? From where I was looking she didn't have to say it. Well, forget her. [HORSE NEIGHING] It's the girl. Gil! Coloradas! It is Coloradas. I see him and many others, not far away now. The Chiricahuas. They won't give us any trouble. Well, they will considering I had to, polish off this Chief's son. Ridiculous. These two cooked up that story in case he was captured. Why, Colorado's Reservation is over the other side of the big canyon. That Injun wouldn't dare leave it. He did! They're coming. We go quick, or we all die. You think she's telling the truth? She always does. We're moving. Kill the fire. Inside. You two stay back here. All right, Marshal. Get 'em off. Oh, you've got my word. How about a gun? Dave cover the door. Not yet. Hey! Look out here. Wait. He's coming in for a powwow. Don't get jumpy. Now look... I've got a small spread below the border near Cervantes. Got a Mexican couple living on it now. I'll write 'em for you. Uh, something else. Now this girl, well, she's alone and uh... Well she'll have some sort of a chance living on my place. See that she gets there, will you? Be glad to... If we get out of here. But you are still... Uh, I think you can get Coloradas to settle for me. What? That's the deal. Nothing doing. Like I said Reardon... We ride out of here like we came in, together. What's left of us. Or we don't ride. Lawman speaks good, Gil. We ride together, or we don't ride. That's it. Coloradas come for white man who killed my son. And for girl. MATT: You're off your reservation bounds, Coloradas. You want to bring the soldiers down on your people? You give me man and girl? I'm taking them both to Laredo. GIL: You want me, Coloradas? I thought I told you to stay put. Sorry, Marshal, this is my deal. You speak brave words, Coloradas, with your Chiricahuas right behind to protect you. Brave like your son Delgados who attacks an unarmed man. And once, the Chircahuas were known as warriors. Your tongue is like a knife. I mean it to cut deep. A Chiricahuas will not dare fight one man alone. He is not brave enough. A Chiricahuas is a coward. You are brave? Ten times more than Coloradas. When the sun is high. We will see who is the warrior. So you're the dealer. Well, son, you sure dealt yourself a hand. [SPEAKING IN NATIVE AMERICAN] One lone hatchet between 'em. Apaches call it the Battle of the Warriors. It's always to the death. [SHOUTING] [CROWD CHEERING] If Reardon comes out top dog, those Indians, left without a leader, will scatter to the wind. With them busy watching the fight, we'll never have a better chance to grab our horses. We could use 'em. I'll try it. Not without me. [APACHES CHEERING] [COLORADOS SCREAMS] Let's move fast. Our horses are back here. Laredo... That's what you wanted to see, isn't it? Marshal, I... Life takes some funny twists, don't it? With you here, this isn't funny. I've got to build myself a smoke. Anybody got the makings? No, Gil! Ha! Why that son of a gun, stole my rifle. You're letting him die. He's making his own ride. He's got his ten minutes. Howdy! It'll cost you a dollar for the night. That includes a rubdown. Collect it from the Marshal. He'll be picking him up. The Marshal? Do me a favor, will ya? Why sure. Tell Ben Keefer, Gil Reardon's in town. Reardon? Oh, you're Reardon. I was at your trial. The Marshal said you broke out of... Just tell Ben Keefer I'm moving his way in five minutes. Oh, yes sir. Sure. Right away, Mister Reardon. [INAUDIBLE] Reardon's in town. He sends word ahead that he'd be coming up the street in five minutes. You shouldn't have shot his wife, Ben. He wants you. Take your rifle. You can get him from the roof of that building across the street. And don't miss. Go out that way. Let's go. Walt will be in position in a few seconds. I could cross over there. That way we'd have him between us. You stick with me. Let's go. Slow down. Let him come to us. [GUNFIRE] [CRASH] Let's go. Go on, Ben draw! You killed Walt and Jordon. Isn't that enough? You murdered my wife. Not them. You shoot me down and you're no better. My gun is holstered. Draw it! Draw it! You want to shoot me in cold blood? Go ahead! I've come a long way to kill you. But you can't do it, can you? Look... I'm throwing my gun away. All right. You had your chance. Your wife would be proud of you. [GUNSHOT] Gil! Rosita! Gil! Reardon's horse, get him! [SPURS HORSE] I'm ready now, Marshal. What for? I don't know what you're talking about, Gil. But Marshal, I'm ready now to... Bass, hurry up with that horse. Get up on your horse. Get up, little lady. You, too. Do you think you can find your way to the border? The border? Yes, yes! I know the way! There's a little spread near a place called Cervantes. Marshal. Now get! Get! [CHUCKLES] MATT: Adios, amigos. It'll all even up in the end. Always does. I guess we'll have to report that he got away from us.Yep. The Prisoner escaped in a hail of bullets. Sure want loco, didn't he? You know, I'd say this town just got its first slice of good luck. You might make a peace officer yet, Dave. I'll buy the drinks.
