[music] [music continues] Hey, What's going on? Ten hours I just spent hustling tables full of ignorant tourists who obviously don't know how to calculate a fifteen percent tip. That's it, I've had it. So what are you going to do? I'm going to go see that modelling agency that approached me last week. They said all I'd need to do is get a couple of head shots done and they could have me set up at a modelling house by the end of the week. That place at the top of the hill? Yeah. Not too shabby, huh? I don't know. I've heard some stuff about that place. Like how it's completely hot. Like how some models go there and never come back. Yeah? Well I'll take my chances. Because this boy is done waiting tables. Man, why is it that every modelling apartment I shack up at doesn't have a laundry room? I swear I spend more time at the laundromat then at go-sees. What are you doing? My agency just called. They want to send me to LA. No way. Yeah. They think I'm ready to tackle the market there. Sweet digs. This is the modelling house they've putting me in. Bet you they've got a washer. Before you head off to your swank Malibu mansion, how about you help me fold. Welcome. You must be Trent. I'm Sheila. Your hostess. Thank you for having me. It's my pleasure. Come on in, I'll introduce you to the others. Thank You. Trent. I'd like to introduce you to your new roommates. Vincent, Stefan and Miguel. Hey Guys, How you doing? I think Trent is going to make a lovely addition to our little family here. Thanks i just hope i get good feedback on my go sees. You know i know it can be a really competitive market out here. Ohh I wouldn't worry about that if i were you. I sense you're going to do great things. And my instincts are never wrong. Wow, that sure beat the canned soup Kris and I used to cook. So, ah where's the other new guy? Oh. He's just an overnight guest. More wine? Oh, I better not. It looks like I've got my first go-see set for nine am tomorrow. Who with? Some designer, Vansee? Vansoi. I've worked with him quite a bit. Really? Any advice you could give me? Just look him in the eye. And I'm sure you'll do fine. Thank you. I'll remember that. Well I better turn in guys. Thanks, I think I'm going to really like it here. I hope you do. Why are you keeping him? You said that anyone else would just be another life to feed. Because I think he could help us. How? His energy. It's...Different. I don't see anything other then another feed. And I'm feeling depleted. Oh stop pouting Miguel. I already have someone waiting to replenish your energies. For now, we leave Trent alone. Understood? Come in. I got this. Leave him! Did you not hear my instruction? I said to leave him. What did you see Trent? I...I don't know. I'll tell you what you saw. You saw a magnificent display of power. Power that any man would die to hold. Power that you could hold. All you have to do is, join us. Ohh come now Trent. You didn't think that all this... Didn't come without a price. Oh please. This is LA, doll. Deal with it. No! [muted yelling] [music] [music intensifies] I sense you're going to do great things. And my instincts are never wrong. Join us? His energy, its different.. [music continues] You saw a magnificent display of power. Power that any man would die to hold. [music intensifies] Join us? [music calms] I see your senses have become heightened. That's one of the many advantages when you become one of us. And what of the disadvantages? Disadvantages? Hmm let's see. Eternal life... Superior senses .. Power. Hmmm No disadvantages I can see. And in time, neither will you. No need to get upset. After all. I called Vansoi personally and told him you were under the weather. He understood. And he's looking forward to your go-see booked for next week. Go see. Like this? How? Of course. What did you think? That we just spent our days just idly siting by the pool, waiting for eager hot things like yourself to come through the door? We have careers. Very lucrative careers. Careers that not only pay, but get us what we need. When you first came here, did you somehow feel drawn to us? Yes. Of course you did. And that's part of our power. And we're able to transmit that power through the photographs taken of us. I don't understand. That night at dinner. When you looked at me. When you looked into my eyes, you were momentarily drawn to me. I felt it. And if I hadn't looked away I could have had you doing anything I wanted. Of course what we want, what we need, is the life force of others to keep us strong. But Sheila taught us how to freeze that power in a photograph, so when others gaze upon it they are drawn to us. It may take away the pleasure of the hunt but it sure is convenient. [brooding music] Did you somehow feel drawn to us? When you looked into my eyes, you were momentarily drawn to me. I felt it. I felt it. [music intensifies] That's one of the many advantages when you become one of us. Eternal life,Eternal life... Superior senses... Power. [swoosh] [birds] [footsteps] I suggest you cheer up Trent. And considering how unhappy they were about my decision to keep you, if they suspect you are not one of them, they'll have no problem getting rid of you. Think about it? [mysterious music] [echoing] I suggest you cheer up Trent. You saw a magnificent display of power. Eternal life,Eternal life... Superior senses, power... Power that any man would die to hold. Power that you could hold. [music continues] You didn't think all this didn't come without a price? You didn't think all this didn't come without a price? [music continues] [music continues] This is LA doll, deal with it. I sense you're going to do great things. And my instincts are never wrong. [music calms] Join us? [birds] If you can make this shot, I'll let you do the honours on our next victim. Ohh, I can make it. [impact] Nice shot.. I bet you couldn't have done that before. Come on. Let me show you what else you can do. Ok, try it now. See. Eternal life comes with many bonuses. Haha, So tell me guys. What so special about Sheila anyway? I mean you guys seem to possess all the power. You're kidding right? Our power's nothing compared to Sheila. She's like a queen bee. And you don't want to piss her off. Do you ever hear a voice, like a little whisper in your head? Yeah. That's her. She's the only one who can get inside you like that. Pull you in and possess you like no other. I mean you don't hear me inside your head do you? Exactly our powers are nothing compared to hers. [growling] [growling] [growling] I have good news. You've just booked your very first photo shoot. Really? But I haven't been on any auditions. You got lucky. You got the job right off your look book. Hmm, what's the job? It's with hot new up and coming photographer named Jerome Lausanne. Sounds delicious. He wants some pictures for his portfolio. He'll be here tomorrow at one. I trust you'll all be on your best behaviour? Yeah, of course. [techno music] That's great, right here at the camera. Oh perfect. Oh perfect. Beautiful. Really feel it. That's great, That's great, Flex those abs. [camera shutter clicking] Perfect, perfect, nice...That's great, that's great. Keep doing it. Beautiful, beautiful, that's incredible. Why don't you take a break while a change my lens. How's our new protege doing? It's incredible. I mean I've never seen such intensity before. It's like his image is practically burning a hole through my lens. Nice. [music continues] His powers of seduction are strong. The photographer senses it. I sense it. The others. I told you he would be a valuable addition to our family. Is he? Even if his powers exceed your own? Don't be a fool. He may be strong in many ways but he is weak in far more. [echoing] How's our new protege doing? [growling] I mean I've never seen such intensity before. It's like his image is practically burning a hole through my lens. [growling] It's incredible. [sinister music] Get out of here, Man. Don't you understand? They'll kill you. [door unlatches] Well, well, well. I smell dinner. Quite impressive, Trey. You've rendered the poor thing completely helpless. Almost takes the fun out of it. I don't know if I can do this guys. Don't worry. We conform kind of a hierarchy here. Vincent feeds first. And, since you're at the bottom of the food chain, you'll feed last. On the contrary. I said if you made that shot. You could do the honours. [suspenseful music] I knew he wasn't one of us. [growling] Haven't you forgotten something? Dispose of him. You know how I despise a mess. [feasting sounds] [birds] In time, you will realize those that feed our need are worth the eternal life you have been given. You make it sound like a gift. It is. One which very few are offered. I didn't want this. I'm not like you. Even the others can see that. So you might as well kill me now before they do. I can't. Your powers are too valuable. You saw the way you drew him to us. And once your images are published, there will be no end to the stream of life forces that are drawn to us. You are one of us now, Trent. Embrace it. There is no other choice. [music] [music continues] I have spectacular news! Your face will be looking down at every angel in this city. What are you talking about? Your new billboard ad. That's right! Your face is going to be gracing the front of a brand new fourteen by forty-eight foot billboard right in the middle of downtown LA. Isn't it fantastic? I cant wait to tell all the others! We have to prepare for the frenzy. [mysterious music] [music continues] [swoosh] [echoing] Sounds delicious. I knew he wasn't one of us. His powers of seduction are strong. When you first came here, did you somehow feel drawn to us? I don't see any thing but another feed. Im feeling depleted. Why are we keeping him even if his powers exceed your own. [music] [music continues] [growl] [growl] [growl] [music continues] Join us? When you first came here. Did you somehow feel drawn to us? When you looked into my eyes, you were momentarily drawn to me. I felt it. I think im really going to like here. Eternal life, superior senses, power... And what are the disadvantages? Knew he wasn't one of us... If they suspect you are not one of them, they'll have no problem getting rid of you. Of course what we want, what we need, is the life force of others to keep us strong. Bet you couldn't have done that before. I could have had you doing anything I wanted. Our power's nothing compared to Sheila. She's like a queen bee. Get out of here Man. Don't you understand? They'll kill you. I sense you're going to do great things. And my instincts are never wrong. Quite impressive, Trent .. You've rendered the poor thing completely helpless. Almost takes the fun out of it. I don't know if i can do this guys. I don't know if i can do this guys. I'm not like you. Even the others can see that. Might as well kill me now before they do. In time, you will realize those that feed our need are worth the eternal life you have been given. [music continues] Its one of the many advantages of being one of us. You didn't think all this didn't come without a price? You saw a magnificent display of power. Power that you could hold. [music continues] [successive growling] [music fades] Hey brother. Congratulations on the billboard. When does it go up? Friday. Just in time for Sunday brunch. We'll see if it pays off. Aww, Miguel, don't be jealous. Besides. It's good news for all of us. Well it's not doing me any good right now. It's been weeks since we've had fresh blood through here. Relax. Sheila's got a new boarder coming in today. A new boarder. Why? It's like Miguel said. It's been weeks. You better not screw it up this time. Because if you do, I'll take care of you myself. [music] Congratulations on the billboard. When does it go up? Just in time for Sunday brunch. It's been weeks since we've had fresh blood through here. [music continues] You better not screw it up this time. Because if you do ill take care of you myself. [abstract rumbling] [music fades] [footsteps] Hello, You must be Kris. Come in. I'll show you to your room. [door clicks shut] [mysterious music] You should leave. Trent, buddy! I was hoping to surprise you. Man, these digs are sweet. I mean they looked good on screen but it's nothing until you're here. I thought you were going to Tokyo. I was, but after putting the lean on my agent I finally got him to agree to send me out here. Shorter flight you know? Plus all that Japanese fish... You should leave. Are you kidding? LA is where it's at. Where dreams come true, baby. Look at you. You don't understand. This house. Sheila. You've got to get out of here before it's too late. What's are you talking about man? They will kill you! Trent? You're not bothering our new guest, are you? Please. You don't understand. He's my friend. Oh. How sweet. You two have history. That will give you something to share over dinner. I won't let you do this. Oh really. And how do you plan on stopping me? [swish] [swoosh] Take it easy... You're not going anywhere. [sinister music] [music intensifies] [growling, struggling] [music] [music continues] Check. I don't know why you insist on fighting us. You do realize it is futile, don't you? That no matter what you do, you are what you are. And that will never change. You know nothing about me. What I do know is this. What ever power you may have had is starting to fade. Your strength is dwindling. And without feeding on the life force of others it will just continue to fade until you are nothing but a soulless corpse. Where is he? Don't worry, he won't be interrupting your lunch. How long are you going to try and convince him into us that he will be willing to accept this? As long as it takes. I don't really have a choice now do I? You could let us take care of him for you. It's too soon for that. Is it? What If he learns to use his power before they begins to weaken, it could mean the end of us all. Or a new beginning. Think of what his powers of seduction can do for us? We will become stronger from the abundance of life force brought right to our doorstep. We could turn are family into an army. Instead of the city of angels, it could become our city. The city of darkness. He will never allow that. He will die before. I'm not so sure. Well we are. And we are plan on making sure he does. Unless you've forgotten, I'm your master, your queen. I am the one who decides the fates. Then let us do what we can to protect our queen. Fine. Tonight then. [suspenseful music] [music continues] [music continues] Oh, Momma's Boy! Oh, Momma's Boy! There you are. You know. I know Sheila told us to wait until sun set but ahh, I just couldn't wait to tell you the good news. After all, I love watching my next victim squirm for a while. It's something about the adrenaline, that makes it taste that much better. You know since I smelt you, I knew make you one of us was a mistake. Not to say I haven't enjoyed toying with you. But, as they say all good things must come to an end. And when night falls I'll be ready to play our last game. Why wait? [growling] [intense music] [music fades] [music] [music continues] [music continues] Vince is that you? I'm still way too full to go hunting again. Then what about being the hunted? Is that you Trent? Hey look. I'm real sorry to see you go. I mean I liked you but, having our meals interrupted, well, it just doesn't sit well. I understand. Cool. Then no hard feelings. Well, I wouldn't say all that. [growling, clawing] [swoosh] [suspenseful music] [growling] [growling continues] Somewhere you have to be? So. Sheila set you free. I knew she had her own agenda. I wouldn't blame Sheila for my release. Although she did inadvertently let me in on a little secret. See, it turns out I am pretty awesome. Even for a vampire who doesn't like to kill innocent people. That being said. I have no problem killing other vampires. Hmm I say my success with Stefan and Miguel, I'm pretty darn good at it. [growl] Sheila! [muted scream] [brooding music] Finally mustered the strength to join us. Pity. The others will be so disappointed when I tell them there'll no dessert tonight. I for one am quite pleased to see you've decided to join us. Looking forward to harnessing your extraordinary powers. I wouldn't bother calling the others. They can't hear you anymore. As a matter of fact, they can't do much of anything anymore. What have you done? Nothing more then what you have had planned for me... [growl] [abstract swoosh] [music continues] [echoing] Finally mustered the strength to join us. Eternal life, superior senses, power. Power that you could hold. Without feeding on the life force of others it will just continue to fade. No matter what you do. You are what you are and that will never change. Look at you. [music fades] Perry. What are you doing here? I thought you were staying up at that model's house in Malibu. I am. I just thought I'd stop in and see how my old roomy is doing. Still slugging it out as a trainer? Yeah, it's not bad. Could be better. Look at me. Making easy money just from looking pretty. So every thing's going all right for you then, huh? Couldn't be better. What about the house? You see anything strange going on? Not unless you consider hanging out by the pool or working out in your own gym strange. But I guess it is if you're used to slumming it. Seriously you should think about it. Here. I even printed out the placement page for the modelling house. Maybe I'll take a look at it. You do that. And I promise you... ...You won't be able to look away. [electronic music] [music continues] [music continues] [music continues] [music continues] [music ends]
