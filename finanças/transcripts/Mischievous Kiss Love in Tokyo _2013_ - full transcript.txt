We are starting tonight's 'Kiss in Tokyo,' hosted by Tama. We have until four in the morning, so please relax and enjoy. Recently I saw a fortune teller, she said I'd fall in love with someone in the near future. But she also said it wouldn't work because I would close my heart to him. This is not good. I need to be brave to tell him how I feel about him. But telling someone my true feelings requires so much courage. Have you had that kind of experience? So tonight let's hear your stories about telling your feelings to someone you love! Hi you. Over there! You don't have time to yawn! Let us hear your heartwarming stories. And some funny stories too! I'm waiting for all your stories! By the way, we have a great view of a meteor shower beginning tonight until tomorrow morning. It is extremely rare for a meteor shower to be observed so clearly in Tokyo. If you make a wish when you see a shooting star, your wish will come true. I'm sure you know this already. If you are having a hard time telling someone your true feelings, why don't you make a wish to the beautiful meteor shower? I wish I can tell Irie-kun how I feel about him. Tonan High School Good morning! - Good morning. You are early today. - Good morning. Sorry, but I'm in a rush. See you later. Dear Irie Naoki, Nice to meet you, Irie-kun. My name is Aihara Kotoko. I'm in Class F. You don't know me... But I know you. When walking with my mom to come here, I saw cherry blossoms and spring flowers blooming... Since you made a speech at the entrance ceremony two years ago... I have been admiring your intelligence and handsome face. There is no way that I can be in the same class with you. This is why I am writing this letter to you. When I first saw you, I felt like I was hit by a shooting star. I started to have special feelings for you. Excuse me. Who are you? I'm Aihara Kotoko from Class F. Could you please read this? Irie-kun, I... I love you. I don't want it. It seemed like my first love had ended pretty easily. No way. But after this, a miracle happened. Subtitles by DramaFever and some QC by \( -o _ o- )/ [Mischievous Kiss] [Love in Tokyo] Episode 1 [A Love Along with a Shooting Star] Look, it's Aihara from Class F. I heard she just told Irie-kun from Class A that she loved him. Seriously? That Aihara Kotoko told Irie-kun that she loved him. - Are you serious? - To Irie-kun? Class F's Aihara told Class A's Irie-kun that she loved him! Does she know what place she is in? Poor girl. Leave me alone! Kotoko, did you tell Irie-kun that you loved him? Jinko, Not so loud! Wait, how do you know that? How can you miss it if you tried to give a love letter in front of the school gate? The whole school is talking about it. I'm so embarrassed. Why did you choose to do it at the school gate? It's like saying 'please talk about it.' Plus, it's Irie that you are talking about. Why did you do such a reckless thing? You knew that you would get rejected, didn't you? If by chance... If by any chance... By any chance maybe he might like me. Stop that! That's not going to happen! We are talking about Irie Naoki right? You know that the classes are divided by the test scores in our school. Irie is the smartest of all the students in Class A which is the smartest class in our grade. On the last national exam, he got the highest score in the nation. A rumor says he has an IQ of 200. He is a genius and good looking. And on top of that, his father is a president of a company. He speaks English fluently. He is an amazing athlete too. He is like Super Boy. Compared to him, we are like failures at the bottom of this school. We live in a totally different world than his. But I did my best too. Each year, I tried so hard to be in Class A with Irie. What is it? Kotoko... You know the alphabets, don't you? Yes, of course. Then can you count how many letters are in between A and F? That's right. You've always been in Class F. It would take a miracle for you to get in to Class A! It's more difficult than winning the lottery. Less possible than having snow falling in the middle of summer! Less possible than getting hit by a shooting star? What? What did you say? Oh, never mind. Anyway, you and Irie live in totally different worlds. You may be right. But I just wanted to tell him my feelings for him before my high school life ends. Naive. - This is for you! - Can you accept this? Irie is so handsome, but he is infamous for having some personality issues. He has no interest in girls. He broke countless girls' hearts. There is not a single rumor about his love life. Hey, look. It's Kotoko. Shut up! Shut up! A boy in his senior year in high school and has no interest in Girls? He is not normal. She's right. I'm sure there is a normal boy who would be a perfect match for you in this world. Kotoko! Hey, Kotoko! Hey, Kotoko! See? The normal guy for you! Kotoko! Is it true that you told Irie that you love him but got rejected? Is it true? Is it true? Kin-chan, too close. I didn't know you liked such a nerd. You have me. I'm not yours, Kin-chan. Oh man, and I made Takoyaki this morning just for you too! I'll have one! Hurry up! Kin-chan's Takoyaki! - Should I open it? - Hurry! Here you go! Let's eat! So delicious. Put on some seaweed too. Here. You do it for her. That was quick. Well, the only thing you are good at is cooking. The only thing? Nobody loves Kotoko more than me! Even if he's in Class A and a genius, he can't beat me at that. How could he turn Kotoko down? This is a challenge from him. He thinks he is something. It's okay. As you said I wasn't thinking right. He didn't even read my letter. He's not worth it. I... I guess I don't have an eye to find a nice boy. I'm fine now. I'm over him. Kotoko. How can you be yawning right now? It's bcoz I stayed up all last night. I was worried that if there were any mistakes in the letter, he would think I'm dumb. I even looked up the kanji characters of my own name. That's absurd. That's how nervous I was. I couldn't even eat my breakfast. That's why I am so grateful, Kin-chan! I think I can survive the morning classes thanks to these. You look great when you smile. I can make Takoyaki as much as you want. So feel better soon. Hmm, so good! You guys are eating too much. Oops! 'Oops?' That was kind of cute. - Put more mayo on them! - But Kotoko is the cutest though. Kotoko! Sorry, we had to talk to the teacher. No worries. I didn't wait that long. Let's go home! By the way, is your new house finished? Yeah, we are moving in on Sunday. Wow, your family is going to own a house! It will definitely cheer me up. Yeah, if you change your home I'm sure your luck will change. A good thing is going to happen to you. Yes. You are right. I believe so. - I believe - I believe - I believe I will help with your moving. - Great. Thanks. - I will come too. - Thanks. - I'm so looking forward to it! Great! - Wow, it's huge! - She's coming! I brought them! - Good morning. We are here! - Dad, they are here! You have to work hard for Kotoko, all right? All right! Good morning! Oh, everyone, thank you for coming to help us! Father. I will do anything for Kotoko. My name is Ikezawa Kinnosuke. - I'm Gintaro. Pleased to meet you. - You don't need to introduce yourself. Father, tell me anything you want me to do as if I'm your own son. Kin-chan, stop promoting yourself and please move the boxes! Yes. Let's do it! Yeah! Let's move some boxes! Thank you all for coming today. Kin-chan is the one who told everyone to come today. Since you were hurt by Irie, he wanted to cheer you up. I see. Okay, let's move some boxes! - These? - Yes, these. Thank you. - The second floor? - Yes, the second floor! - It's heavy - Heavy. Second floor? Yes, second floor. - Thank you very much. - Thank you. I think we finished moving everything. Yes, we are finished! Well, it is a very nice house, Father. I made my late wife and Kotoko suffer so much. You and I worked so hard together and finally built our own house. Daddy, don't cry in front of everyone! Kotoko is going to have a difficult time when she gets married. Don't worry. I will marry into your family any time. Father, please think of me as your real son. Please call me Kin-chan... Thank you all for your help today. Thanks to you guys, we could finish early. Let's go inside and have some food. I will make some of my best dishes. Yay! He is a professional chef! I can't wait! Hold on. Hold on. Do you hear a strange sound? Huh? Nope. I think it's just in your head. I have a bad feeling about this. What are you talking about? Hmm? A shooting star? What? Can't be. It's the middle of the day. Shigeo and Aihara Kotoko Did it just get hit by a shooting star? Around noon today, parts of a meteor shower fell on a house in Tokyo and destroyed it. We interviewed the victim, Shigeo Aihara. A shiny object fell on to the roof of my house... And the ground shook, then... It was crushed. My house was destroyed. Well, when it first made a hole on the roof... It didn't look so big. Fortunately we were all outside. Perhaps, my late wife saved us... Excuse me. I worked so hard to build that house. Now we don't have a place to go. The meteorite that fell was only about 3 centimeter in diameter. The experts think that it was triggered by the meteorite... but the house collapsed because of negligence during the construction. The next news is... Temporarily Closed Hello, I'm sorry but we are closed today. Please call again next time. Cheer up, Daddy. I worked hard everyday to get to this point. You can start again from this point. How can I run a business like this? I can't even rent an apartment. I've spent all my savings on that house. I understand if it was a fire or an accident. But a meteorite? My insurance doesn't even cover it. I'm totally out of luck. That's not true. You have luck. All of us could be dead now if the meteor fell after we went inside the house. Even if you survived but lost your arm, you wouldn't be able to work as a chef. If that happened, we would have to close this restaurant. Right? But we are here without a scratch. We should be grateful for that. We can't be luckier than this. We are extremely lucky, aren't we? What is it? I was thinking how much you resembled your mother. Your mother was also excessively optimistic. Excessively? Can you say it in a nicer way? But what do you think is the probability of our house getting hit by a shooting star? Why are you calling it 'a shooting star?' Instead of thinking that we are the victims... I want to think that the house was hit by a shooting star. It's more romantic, isn't it? Doesn't it make you feel like something very special is going to happen? Gosh, you are really starting to resemble your mother. Hello, this is Aihara. Yes. Yes? I see. Could you please hold on a second? Master, a customer would like to talk to you directly. Okay. Hello, this is Aihara speaking. I'm sorry for your inconvenience... Iri-chan? How are you? You are still alive? Oh, that's a question that you should ask me. Iri-chan? It's Aihara from Class F. Isn't her house destroyed? - Did you watch the news? - I did. It was in the newspaper too. She got rejected by Irie not so long ago. That's Kotoko who got hit by a falling meteor. Bad things keep coming to her. Maybe she's possessed by something. - Kotoko! - Kotoko! Jinko. Satomi. You are the center of attention everyday. I just want to disappear. By the way, have you found a place to stay? Well, I think we can stay at my father's best friend's house for a little bit. Oh really? How did you find someone like that so soon? The person saw us on the news and contacted us right away. What a nice person! I'm so happy for you. I think your luck will change from now on. You think so? The probability of getting hit by a shooting star is one in a billion. I want to believe that good luck will hit me this time. - Good. - Ouch! That is the Kotoko I know. That's right. Right? Please donate your money! What is that? Even a little bit would help. Even 10 yen would help! 5 yen is fine, so please donate your money! For Aihara Kotoko who lost her house because of a falling meteor yesterday... We are collecting contributions from everyone! Your schoolmate Kotoko was hit by a shooting star... That guy is so dumb. It's Kin-chan after all. Kin-chan, stop it. Kotoko is here now! Although she had such a horrible day yesterday, she is here today with her smile. She is so cute today as usual. She's making me cry. Kin-chan, stop this you idiot. Why? I'm doing this for you! I don't want everyone to talk about me anymore. After all, she is standing out quite a bit. People are going to talk about her more now. Can I get by? Irie-kun. How could you talk to us like that? Kotoko is very hurt. Whose fault is that? The meteor shower? That's something else. It's because you turned her down in such a horrible way. That's nonsense. Yeah. After that, so many bad things happened to Kotoko. The probability of solid planetary material from outer space hitting a human is one in ten billion. Solid planetary material? You mean a shooting star? That incident with the probability of one in ten billion, was my fault? That's right. Kin-chan. That doesn't make any sense. Ehh?? I didn't know I had such a great power. If I donate this money, you won't argue with me anymore, right? Don't treat me like that! I can't believe I admired someone like you... for two years. I will die before I take your money. Are you sure you want to tell me that? Of course I am! Do you have any friends? Look! I have many friends who would come when I need their help. Kin-chan, Jinko and Satomi... You are doing great! That is why I don't need your help! I'm giving this back to you. Are you looking down us because we are in Class F? Don't look down on us just because we are not smart! After all, you became so famous again. You must be the only girl who tried to pick a fight with him. No way. What should I do? That wasn't what I had in my mind. I'm sorry that I made you come home early just to help with the move. Why are you apologizing? Situation like this, of course I have to help. My teacher understood too. This is Iri-chan's house. Wow, it's huge! Iri-chan is the president of a major company. He graduated from the University of Tokyo. University of Tokyo? He must be smart. So big... We can have a barbeque. How do I read that? Irie. I see, it's Irie-kun. Irie? Right. Irie. That's why I call him Iri-chan. Why Irie? Out of all other names... Hmm? What's wrong? Nothing. Let's go. Ai-chan, welcome! What happened? Why did it take so long? Sorry, it took a while to find my stuff under all the rubble. Really? I'm glad you are here. I was so surprised. I was just talking to myself. Irie? Oh my, we were waiting for you. I'm so happy that you are here. Please feel at home. Thank you, Iri-chan. I really appreciate this. Mrs. Irie. Thank you for letting us stay. I'm sorry for what happened to you. Please enjoy your stay here. I am Kotoko. Nice to meet you. I'm happy to have a pretty girl like you here. We only have sons. You have sons? I will introduce them to you later. Please come in. This way, please. - Please. - Thank you. This is cute. Oh Yuki. Come down and greet them. This is Mr. Aihara. He is your son? So cute. Hello. Nice to meet you. I'm Irie Yuki. I'm in the third grade. He is such a smart boy. Pleased to meet you. Pleased to meet you too, Yuki-kun. Um, you two must be tired. This way, please. Thank you for having us. Please, help yourself. So good. I'm glad you like them. Please have some more. Thank you. But you've grown so much, Kotoko-chan. You've met me before? When you were a baby, I saw you at the restaurant. You came to my father's restaurant? Yes, of course. Iri-chan and I have been very close friends since kindergarten. Since both of my parents worked. I used to go to Ai-chan's house to eat dinner everyday. And when I was a university student, I was poor and had no money... Ai-chan was already a chef, so he always gave me something to eat. Well, Ai-chan always took care of me. What are you saying? When I opened my restaurant, you recommended it to so many people. Your classmates from the University of Tokyo... Your business partners... Even now, many of them come to my restaurant. I could keep my business because you helped me. Oh please. We both have families now... And had kids... And since we were both busy working. We grew apart from each other. When I saw the news, I was so surprised. Well, that was unfortunate, but... I am so happy that we could see each other again. Right? That's right. Kotoko, please feel like this is your own home. Yes, thank you. You and I seem like we are fated to meet each other. It is like 'speak of the devil...' My older one just came home. 'Older one.' What's wrong, Kotoko? Kotoko is very energetic. I apologize for the late introduction. I'm the older son, Irie Naoki. Pleased to meet you. I was told that you and Naoki go to the same school. I didn't know that. Pleased to meet you too. Kotoko, greet him too. What are you doing, Kotoko? It's just that... I'm just so surprised... Because Iri-chan and Irie-kun don't look alike at all. That's so rude. Well, well, well. Both of our sons look like their mother. Lucky right? Oh Papa. You should sit down too. It was fortunate that you two didn't get hurt. Were you at home then? If Kotoko didn't stop me, I would have been inside. That's very close. That was a close call. So how big was the meteorite? This big. It was a tiny little thing like this. Like 3 centimeters? Yeah. Do you think a house would collapse from that little thing? But I'm glad to hear that Kotoko already knew Naoki. Could it be that both of you are in the same class? Our classes are pretty far apart but recently we met in an unexpected way. Right? Kotoko-san... Well, yes... That's good. Now you can get to know each other more. Naoki is a little unique, don't you think? Do you think you can be his friend? Big brother, I finished today's homework. Is that so? Good job. But there is one kanji character that I didn’t know how to read. Today instead of asking you... I will ask Kotoko-neesan. (Big sis) That's a good idea. Kotoko big sis, could you please tell me how to read this kanji character? Sure. Since this is for 3rd graders. I'm sure I can read it. Hmm? What is it? Yuki-kun, you are amazing. You are in 3rd grade, but you learn so many difficult kanji characters. And which one can't you read? This one. This one. You read this 'rabbit' and 'horn'. 'Rabbit' and 'horn.' Are you an idiot? This is read 'tonikaku (in any case).' You are in high school but you can't even read this? Hey Yuki, that is very rude. Apologize. In any case, I hate you. Hey, Yuki. Hey! I'm sorry for what he said. No, I should have been able to read it. No no no, he is not used to being around a girl. I think he is just being shy. Don't take it personally. Kotoko-chan. Now I want to show you your room! That's a good idea. I'm so excited about this! Come this way! You still eat a lot. - This is so good. - Is it good? It's really good. I feel like I'm making silly jokes. Ta-da! What do you think? No good? You don't like it? Maybe I got too excited? You know we only have boys... But I've always wanted a girl. I have dreamt to have a room like this. A room full of frills and soft toys... I am super happy. Since my mother passed away when I was little, I've never had girlie things like this. You know how my father is. He gave me clothes that were simple and strong. When I saw my friends wearing dresses with frills... I was so envious. I feel like my dream has came true. That's why... For me I've always wanted to go shopping with my daughter... And see a movie together... And exchange our clothes... Those were my dreams! Please stay with me, okay, Kotoko-chan? Yes! This used be Yuki's room. Thanks to you, his school desk came to my room. My room is so cluttered now. Why do you have to ruin our fun? Please don't say unnecessary things, Naoki! That's why... In any case, I hate you. Kotoko, don't worry about anything. Just think of this as your home, okay? Okay. Naoki, can you please help her to organize her stuff? I'm going to start preparing for dinner! We are going to have sukiyaki tonight! Kotoko, do you like sukiyaki? Yes, I do! Perfect! Well, I will see you later! Um... Well... What should I start with? That's okay. I'll do it myself. Oh yeah. That's right. There is no reason for me to help you. I don't care if you live here or not. Just don't disturb my life. The probability of getting hit by a shooting star is one in ten billion. How many billion would the probability be that a girl ends up living with a boy who rejected her? Is it the beginning of something special? Or... I like this. Thank you for waiting! I brought you more! Thank you very much! How about you, Mr. Aihara? By the way, do you like toast for breakfast? Or would you like to have rice instead? I'm totally fine. Really? I feel like I'm traveling abroad. Like you are in Monaco, right? I... With Irie-kun... We're having breakfast together. Hot! Lame. Hey, Yuki! Thank you for the breakfast. Is it time already? Kotoko-chan, why don't you go with him? Since you two are in the same school. Yes. Here. You can have the rest, Dad. Thank you for breakfast. Bye! Bye! - Can you... - Yes? Can you walk far away from me? Why? I don't want to walk with a girl who has bread crumbs all over her. Walk at least 2 meters away from me. Follow me and remember the path to school. Obviously, don't tell anyone that we live in the same house, got it? Don't ever talk to me at school. You don't have to be that mean... I don't want to be involved in those worthless rumors anymore. Worthless? I hate girls with no brains. I'm so mad! I can't believe I was in love with such a jerk for two years! I will make him sorry for what he said to me!
