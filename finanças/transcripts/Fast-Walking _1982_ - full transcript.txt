Now... Goddamn it, man. Just listen to this plan. I got my eye on a little something I'm reading about in these brochures. It's down in that southeast desert corner of the state. Probably get about, uh... 10 inches of rainfall a year. That comes in the form of snow in the winter. See, that's why nobody wants it. The aridity. So... Ahh...you know what that means for US? Ha ha! That means we can steal it. It's just sitting there waiting for US to grab it. So... I figure... We can go in, like... On a ranch together. You know, run it communal style... You know? Huh. It would be great, wouldn't it? This could make our fortunes for US. Oh, man. Ha ha! This could be solid gold. Ha ha! You ever hear of that, uh... Oh, you know, there are drawbacks to this, I suppose, but... My plan is to make... To make, uh... Virtues out of them. Did you ever hear of that, uh... Awahee... Owahee river up there in Oregon? Awahee? Something like that. Anyway, up along the south fork, they sell the land. It's, uh-- it's dirt-cheap. Ha ha! Ha ha! They even got an Indian reservation nearby-- a fort McIntosh. No, it's mcin-- mcdermitt. Ha ha! Indians. Ha ha! We could, like... A couple of groovy-looking broads to go up there. Get... Oh, two or three to a man... At least... And kind of... [Exhales] You know, Indian it out. I can see you and me up there... Just squaw it out for the whole winter. How's that sound? Ha ha ha! [Car horn honks] [Door closes] [Sigh] [Dialing telephone] Control? Miniver, east block. The count is 3-4-2. Hey, shit, I know I'm late. I had to count them twice. Because I missed a couple of skippies in the same bunk, o.K.? O.k. Yeah, o.K. Right away. O.k., wasco. Wake them up. [Buzzer ringing] [Prisoner] No, I ain't getting up! Pig got to come drag this nigger out! Yeah! Run it down, bro! Shut up, nigger! Oh, eat shit, peckerwood! Fuck you, jigaboo! Viva la raza! Fuck you, you wetback motherfucker! You know who the real enemy got to be! Who's the enemy? The man! Abso-fucking-lutely, baby! The hack! The main cop! The pig! [Shouting and cheering] Ha ha ha! O.k., tier men, fourth tier to chow first, squeeze. You should have had them out of here 10 minutes ago. Trying to get US a black eye around here? Come on. Move it! All right, outside! Aah! [Thump] Which nigger bought it? Who gives a shit? When do we eat? Who is it? It's j.J., I think. No! No, no. Don't let anybody touch him. Go ring the lockup bell... And make sure those colored get back in their cells. [Prisoner] Who got dusted, man? Who was it? What happened, man? [Lockup bell ringing] O.k., uh... Let me put it to you this way. I'm only going to say this once, so listen good. It's going to take me about one minute to go in the shanty and report this homicide. Then I'm coming back out here. Anyone I find not in his cell will spend the summer in the hole. You took the words right out of my mouth. What's going on? J.j. Just went off the fourth tier. Probably wanted to be first in the chow line. Hello, control. There's been a homicide in the east block. Yeah, get me the ambulance and the lieutenant. No, let the lieutenant tell the warden. I'll get to the bottom of this. What the hell brought this on? It's probably racial. For Christ's sake, don't start that. Let's not look for trouble. It's racial, all right. What is it? Toilet paper, sir. What does it say? "Eat shit, nigger." [Prisoner] Hear that, niggers? Eat shit, jigaboos! Clean this mess up. Yes, sir. What are these inmates doing out of their cells? They're the tier men for this block, sir. Tier man? How did that happen? He's only been back in here two weeks. Merit, sir. Best man for the job. A lockup bell means everyone. Hold it a second. We'd better get these men fed, or we'll have a shitload of trouble. I think we already have it. [Prisoners chanting and clapping] [Cheering] All right! Look how easy that thing sails over that wall, huh? Ha ha ha! Negative thinking. Cut that out. I told you to those who can... Change adversity into fortune. You haven't done so bad listening to your old man so far, have you? No. Assistant to the chief tier-tender is better than working your ass off for 35 cents a day like these fools. Yeah, I guess. You just got to keep thinking positively all the t-- wait a minute. Listen, squeeze, I want you to cop a nickel bag of boy and a cap of crank on credit and see if you can find a fit. I don't want to start chipping. I'm not starting a habit I can't feed. Did I say anything about youusing anything? No. Well, what? I had this 15-bag-a-day habit before I came in here-- just...cop it, man. Now, boys, we got a real tough situation here with this radical big shot galliot transferring in here tomorrow. He couldn't be coming at a worse time, after what happened this morning. Now, there's a lot of talk going around about the militant colored here planning some sort of racial ruckus because of a stupid rumor that someone's got a contract out on their hero. This is what got them all stirred up. I don't know of anyone within these here walls who'd want to harm even one hair on his nappy head. Do you agree with that, Jackson? Oh, yes, sergeant. But it don't matter because they believe someone's gunning... Psst! Psst! Tighten up our ship by maintaining proper surveillance in all areas within our responsibilities with double alertness. You got that? O.k., I want all access doors... [Grunting] Argh... Ahh. ...everyone, including water boys, laundry and kitchen help, andtier men, locked up by 10:00 on the dot. I want any and all infractions, rebellious actions, or back talk... Ahh... No matter how trivial-sounding or unimportant, reported to me on the double! You got it? O.k. Now, guard assignments for tomorrow. Assignments remain the same, except visitors' room-- Jackson, Otis. Yeah. Wall post eight-- miniver, frank f. East cell block-- Richards, Edwin. All right, that's all, men. I hate the wall. I always have, and I always will. Just a minute, miniver. Did I detect an air of dissatisfaction with your guard assignment for tomorrow? No, sir. I'm kind of looking forward to it. Not that anyone owesyou an explanation, but it is standard procedure in this facility during periods of agitation to assign only the best marksmen to the wall posts. Count on me, sir. I'll be on my toes. Frankly, miniver... I don't count on you for a damn thing. In case you think you're fooling anyone here with that smart-ass attitude, you should know I've been watching you. That's right, miniver. Watching and waiting... For one more fuck-up-- just one more. Then I'm personally going to bust your ass right on out of here. Is that a fact? Oh, that most certainly is a fact. If I were you, hotshot, I'd start thinking about that fact-- that your days are numbered here. Think about that, miniver-- numbered. Well, lieutenant... That's the best news I heard all day because the fact is, that's all I ever think about... Sir. Hurry up, darling. You want to get off, too? It's a filthy habit. I never touch that stuff. God, I love it here in this joint. You know that, squeeze? I just fucking love it. There's no place like it in the whole damn world. There's nothing you can't do in here if you got the balls. It's as simple as that. You just believe in yourself. Follow your star. It leads you right to opportunity, and here it has again. Goddamn. What's happening? It's nothing. It's goddamn lemonade. I'd have to shoot six bags of that shit just to even get straight. Yeah. Old bullet. Huh? Bullet. He's the connection. He never did deal good smack. He never held anything that would take an eight in his whole fucking life. Here's what we're going to do. Tomorrow, you'll take a walk down in the yard and find old bullet and tell him his old buddy wasco wants to see him. Will he come? Uh... Ha ha! Yeah, he'll come. And you know what, squeeze? I think the whole scam-- the whole grand design-- is going to work just like a charm, and you might even turn out to be my main man. What do you think about that? Uh, well... Uh... I, uh, yeah. Hey, amigo! Ese, hombre. Â¿como estas? Hey, man, listen. I got $10 you let these boys off a couple hours, come over to Evie's. They haven't been laid in weeks. Bueno. Call them in, boy! Muchachos! Danny! Luis! [Cheering] Ooh, needs a bit of work. Oh! Coming down. Here we go. Whoops! Fifth floor, lingerie. Just made some fresh if you want it. I could really use it. Thanks. Be right there. O.k. Thank you. Ahh, there we go. Thank you, my darling, and now a little musica andandale for fast-walking miniver. [Tuning radio] [Music playing] O.k., have a nice day, girls. Boys, let's not waste time. Do your business and back in the truck. One to a girl. This is a class operation. No double-teaming. Marquis of queensberry rules. No full nelsons, no sodomy, no anal abuse. [Register rings] Did you get Valentino over there? Yeah, I got him when he came in. Oh, hey, Evie? You want to cash my paycheck for me? Jesus. It gets smaller and smaller, doesn't it? Well, you know how it is. Yeah. You're just a hard-luck kid, aren't you? One pickle after another. Just temporary. I got plans to put all this behind me. I'm sure you do. Hey, Miguel! Go out back there for me, will you? See what's going on. Here you go. Thanks. And take them on back afterwards. Hey. Thanks. So...tell me what's new in the joint. I hear an east block nigger got iced. Got everybody turned around with galliot due in, huh? Bad news travels. Huh! Sure does. The vine says there's a contract out on him. Is that what you hear? You know a hack doesn't like to talk about the joint once he's outside. I am just passing the time of day. I'm going into town. I got to get to the bank before it closes. Here. I got a little present for you. Stick that in your lunch box. What's in it? For you. In the thermos. Coffee, honey. What else? Bullshit, honey. You just have to give it to wasco. What's the big to-do? When did he start dealing? Bullet's got that all locked up. You have known my brother all your life. He don't let any grass grow. If you were closer to your cuz, you wouldn't be in the mess you are! Well, plenty of grass will grow while he's doing his 3-10. Oh, I wouldn't be too sure about that. Someone up there in government likes that boy a lot. It's going to mean unlimited opportunities for all of US. That's just for starters. You get 200 bucks every trip. How's that? That will get you well in a hurry. Yeah, I can smell it. Definitely there. Smell what? The old scam, Evie. Wasco wouldn't be running the slow shuck on his little cousin fast-walking, would he? What makes you say a thing like that? A half-dozen hacks would do this for $100 a pop! This is family, honey! You know wasco isn't greedy! Do you know how bad he feels about you having to hustle in the joint and then moonlighting out here, working your ass off wiping up after wetbacks, honey? You got nothing to show for it. You're breaking my heart. You're right. I should be more appreciative. I'll thank wasco the next time I bump into him. Nothing's going to change you, is it? You still got a handful of "give me" and a mouthful of "much obliged." Will you get up off your ass and clean up this place? Wash down the chicken coops, too! They're beginning to stink! Evie. And don't close the place just because I'm gone! Evie! What? You forgot something. You sure you don't want it? I'm sure. [Frank] Here's how I figure it. We'll get out of here when I get some money in the bank. We're going in together on a ranch in Oregon. Huh? You hear that? And we'll run it communal. Like that commune thing? Like the hippies? We put everything in common. We split all the work and all the money! You do all the work. I make all the money. Wash under there. Come on. O.K. I'll make it legitimate. We'll get married. I've got enough love to handle both of you. How's that sound? Whoa! Under there! [Sigh] Do you own this place? That's right, honey. Good. How about putting me to work? I could use a job. What kind of work are you interested in? You've got to be kidding. You trying to tell me you're in the market? You got it. Well! Uh, o.K. Well, why don't you just step over here and let me take a little look at you? I thought we got that out of the way already. Listen, honey. I'll be honest with you. Traffic here is pretty heavy. Them old wetbacks can get awfully rough. I just got to be sure you can handle the trade. I don't suppose you'd take my word for it? Well, let me ask you a fair question. Would you buy a used car from somebody, say, no matter how good it looked, without taking it for a little spin around the block? That's what I thought. [Zipper unzipping] Well? Well what? When do I start? Ha ha! Listen, honey, you're, uh--you're special. No doubt about that. I'll have to give this one some real thought. What the hell is this? Wait a minute. I'm not saying I haven't got something in mind. I was going to suggest you come back tomorrow. Maybe I'll give you another tryout. Ha ha ha! Aren't you being a bad sport about this? Shut up, asshole. I'm going to teach you a lesson you'll never forget. Give me your wallet. Oh, Jesus. It's got my whole month's pay in it-- give it to me. Now unbutton your pants. Excuse me? Unbutton your pants. Get the zipper down! [Zip] I hope you remember what a good piece of ass you just got... Because it's the last you'll ever have. Oh... Oh! On the other hand... It would be a fucking shame to take away the only thing you got going for you. [Gasp] [Door opens] [Door closes] [Alarm beeping] You wait there. [Door closes] There he is. Galliot! Galliot! I'm with you, brother! [Prisoner] Galliot! [Prisoner] Right on, brother. Man, that's galliot! Hey, galliot! Galliot! Galliot! Hey, galliot! There's galliot. Come on, man. That's galliot. [Cheering] [Galliot] All right, brothers. Mm-hmm. I'm with you. Be strong! Yes. Yeah. All right. All right, brother. Mm-hmm. All right. All right! Power! Galliot! Galliot! Galliot! Galliot! Galliot! Galliot! Galliot! Galliot! Galliot! Galliot! Galliot! Galliot! Galliot! Galliot! Galliot! Galliot! Galliot! Galliot! Galliot! Galliot! Galliot! Galliot! Galliot! Galliot! Galliot! Galliot! Galliot! Galliot! Galliot! Galliot! Galliot! [Prisoners] All right! [Man] Yeah! [Clapping] [Horn blows] Nice. Come on in and sit down. [Sigh] I'm buying you out. You're what? I'm going to make you a very honorable proposal of a business nature that you won't be able to refuse. Oh, yeah? Goddamn! You smell bad, man. Uh... Let me run this down to you, bullet, old baby. Number one, you're a junkie, which means you can't maintain the kind of objectivity that's necessary in an operation like this. Number two, you don't have my connections. Frankly, see, your action's weak, small-time, small profit, nickel, dime bag operation at best. Your supply is erratic. Your goods are inferior. You're dealing nothing but trash. Hey, wait a minute! Shut up and listen. Now, you see, I can offer this market dynamite smack-- I mean the best money can buy. It's so good you can get off just snorting it. Save everybody the trouble of carrying a fit around with them. They could just chip like that till they get out. And I got a guaranteed supply daily coming in six days a week-- any kind of thrill, any quality, any kind of quantity that any customer can desire. I can sell by the cap, bag, bindle, bundle, half-load, nickel, dime, quarter, tray bag, the piece or the pill. You just call it, and I've got it. I've got ludes, crank, bombitas, coke, bam, black beauties, cartwheels, yellow jackets, reds, long Greens, rainbows, beans, and stp and pcp and dmt and LSD and psilocybin and mescaline and thc, amphetamine, meth, biphetamine, phenobarbital, benzedrine, dexedrine, librium, miltown, dilaudid, morphine, seconal, demerol, goof balls, truck drivers, yellow stripes, tuinal, desoxyn, carbon tetrachloride, strychnine, arsenic, anything. I deal anything except marijuana and hashish because I can't stand the smell of that shit. For the ultimate thrill of your lifetime, I'll personally drill a hole in your head. You can see the light of the lord. I can even offer dollies, man. I got the best dolophine money can buy for anybody who wants to kick their habit one day at a time. I ain't jealous, because I ain't a junkie. I don't approve of the use of dope, but if somebody's going to buy it, they may as well buy it from me. You know, a lot of dudes brought their habit in here. They got to have that wake-up, the nooner, the matinee, and the sleepy-time seven days a week just like clockwork. And I'm prepared to offer this jam the best fucking hard-ass poison on the market today, and I can offer you something else. What's that? Protection-- top to bottom. Yeah? Who's made? Who's made? You ought to be pissing your pants. You're getting in on one of the biggest deals ever made, and you're asking me who's made? That's why you never got anywhere-- because you think small. That's small thinking, see. I'm thinking about diversification. You know what that word means? It means cigarettes and prostitution and banking services and loan facilities, organized gambling, liquor, clothing sales, uncensored postal service and underground courier service direct to the street and stud service and telephone service right to the outside. I'm even thinking about selling processed hair accouterments to the rag-head nigger konks. I'll smuggle in hot sauce for the spic cellblock lunchtime direct from Tijuana. I think you're crazy-- out of your fucking mind. I'll offer you a deal you can't refuse. What's that? Turn your whole operation over to me intact like it is right now. Then when my supply starts coming in, which might even be today, you just sit back. You got a silent partnership. You got no risk. You get 10% of the whole operation. You make more money than before. What if I say no? You can't. Yeah, but what if I do? I'll kill you. I'd love to kill you. I'll throw you off the tier right now. You'll never get away with it. What do you care? You'll be dead. Later. I willget away with it. When sergeant sanger comes up here, a man I've known all my life, whose kids I grew up with, whose daughter I went out with, whose football team I starred for-- and he will come up here-- and he'll ask me, "were you involved in this?" I'll look him in the eye like I used to when he asked if I was having sexual relationships with his daughter or shooting his .38 pistol in his back yard, which I was, and I'll look him in the eye and say, "no, sir, I wasn't." He will believe me because I'm a local boy. He'll file an accidental death report. O.k., you made your point. Maybe I was wrong. I guess I could use a partner. Ahh! Well, that's better. Congratulations. Let's get down to the yard. I'll introduce you to my organization. Do that with squeeze. I got a visitor waiting. That's no problem. Are you going now? After you. Oh, no. After you. You're the boss now. I'll see if it's cool. Oh! Oh! Aah! Aah! Stop! Oh! You know, I must have a soft spot in my heart for you. Aah! I will forget this misunderstanding, and we'll go ahead with this deal just like I said. Aah! Now, get out in that yard. Ooh! [Coughing] Nan? Nan, I have a surprise for you. What? I stopped smoking. How long has it been since you didn't open that pack? Five weeks. Five weeks? Well, you could have written me a letter about that. [Sigh] [Man] Forget the cigarettes. Big deal. Forget the cigarettes. [Man] I've been exercising. I'm jogging in the yard. Yes. [Man] Careful what you're writing. Careful. I told you they check the letters here. You keep writing. Let me tell you, be careful what you write. They read everything. Yeah. I'm telling you, they check everything in this place. They look up your caboose. Right. I really could use a coffee. Hi. Hi. Are you cool? Mm-hmm. Are you ready? I'm ready. So lean back. Get that hair off your front. Do your nipples get hard when you squeeze them? Come on. I want to see you do it. [Nan] Not that Mildred would ever put up a fuss. You know that, Ted. I know. I know. [Nan] She knows it's our home. She wouldn't want to be in the way. But how could I, I mean we, in all conscience, first ask her to share our home-- you know, move in with me because I'm afraid to be alone-- then discard her like an old shoe? It just isn't right. It's not the loneliness I mind so much. I'm not lonely. I always was a person that liked my own company. You know that. It's the not having anything to look forward to that makes it so hard, and your not writing doesn't help any. I don't know why it's so much trouble for you to write a letter. Even a post card would be something to look forward to. God knows you have the time. Show it to me. Come on. [Nan] You could let me know what you're thinking about. You never want to share that. You never did. Maybe if we talked things over more. Oh, well. What's the sense of going into that again? I just thought being in here might change all that, but I can see it won't. I said to myself before I came here I wasn't going to let the conversation get into this. But if you just knew what it was like being alone with nothing to look forward to. And then when I see you... I know it's not a nice thing to say, but I still feel alone. Well, even right now, I feel you're not with me. You're somewhere else a million miles away. Ted? Ted? What's wrong? Are you all right? Yes. Oh, I feel so good. I just wish I had a fucking cigarette. Oh, for heaven's sakes. [Sigh] Come here. So... What's up? The dope thing is happening as soon as you and Evie send it in. The first one's already in. Cool. The other thing is-- it's a Swiss clock. I got chief tier man second week in. Nigger's already in here. Everybody knows there's a contract. They make the deposit? Sure did. Saw it myself. Dropped right in the box. I've got the key. Did you get started on baby cousin Frankie? Better than that. What do you mean, "better than that"? I mean he'll be ready whenever you are. Where did you do it? It was at Evie's. Where at Evie's? Sitting in the rocking chair. Her rocking chair? Mm-hmm. I want you to tell me. Do you want to hear everything? I want to know everything. Come on. Tell me about it. Just think how hot your little moke was standing there, knowing it was working, watching him grow, watching him get bigger just looking at you, getting all wet before you even had your dress off. Oh, god, I couldn't wait to touch him-- to feel his excitement grow and grow until he lost all control, until he'd do anything I wanted. And then I was doing it, only something was happening-- something that's never happened to me before. I was losing control. And I didn't care that he was controlling me, makingme do things and feel things I've never felt with anyone. Beautiful. Oh, god, how I loved it-- loved it when he was so deep inside me I couldn't breathe, couldn't even speak to beg him to stop, only praying that he wouldn't because it was starting-- that feeling-- starting to build towards that explosion I knew was coming, getting closer and closer. Oh, god, it's-- [sanger] Shakedown. Let's go. Shit. This is for wasco. Don't touch it. Let's go. Turn that shit off. [Man] Shakedown. Here they come. [Man] Come on up. 32...33... 34...35... Well, look who's here. If it ain't our friend Mr. Galliot. Sorry about this. Shakedown? Right. You know the rules, I guess. Actually, I don't. I'm new here, remember? Now's as good a time as any to get familiar with procedures. Pull the bar on 13. Speaking of procedures, sergeant, not that I'm paranoid, but would there be any significance of my not being on the fourth tier and no cellmate? I wouldn't know about that, but I'd get that smart ass of yours up off that floor. Now move it. All right. Outside. Now hold it. Get those pants off. Again? [Unzips zipper] Now, Mr. Galliot, I want you outside. Get those skivvies off and spread that moon for the officer so we can see what you got up there. Take him 20 feet down. Then wait there. O.k., drop them. Now spread them. Watch him. O.k., fast-walking, get in here and search this cell, and I want to see you do it right. Nice. What's that? Answer the sergeant, miniver. What did you find? Well, as long as you asked, sir... I believe it's the knife the sergeant just put there. [Man] Pig planted a shiv. [Man] Planted a fucking knife. What are you talking about? We ain't found no knife. [Man] Come on up here, pig. See what you find. Let's go. O.k. Back in the cell. You fucking scaredy-cat. Looks like you came away clean this time, but don't let that fool you. You make any mistakes around here, you'll regret it till your dying day, which, from what I hear, won't be long in coming. Inside. 13--lock it up. [Lieutenant] Miniver! [Jackson] Think they'll ice that dude? [Fast-walking] What? Galliot. I hear they're on his case. What's that about-- the same old civil rights shit? Haven't you heard, fast? The klan is making a comeback. They're afraid this guy will get their sheets dirty? Yeah. You saw the way the brothers reacted when he came into the joint. He has the magic, so he's got to go. That was definitely heavy. Hey, you pulled the visitors' room today, right? Yeah. You see a fox come in around noontime? I saw this one that you would not believe. She must have got the whole room off. Yeah. I could believe that. Who did she visit? Wasco. Said she was his old lady. [Ding ding ding] Hi there. Just yourself? No. I was looking for the party in 23. There's no one there. That's right. She's gone. Do you know if she'll be back? They checked out this morning. Did they say where they were going? Listen. Them kind say nothing to nobody, and I ain't about to ask any questions. It's a shame, though-- a nice girl mixed up with all them colored. Uh. They'd just as soon kill you as look at you. I wonder how they got that way. They're colored. [Galliot] "My dearest Elaine, "I firmly believe there is a conspiracy "within these walls to murder me "as soon as safely practical. "Therefore, time is of the essence "to the extent that the movement's $50,000, "originally appropriated for legal and other purposes, "must be gathered in hand immediately. "You must do this at once "to be used exclusively for the only possibility "of survival still remaining-- "escape. "Regardless of the risk involved, "I must escape. "Our work is too important. "As of this moment, there isn't a shred of hope "to indicate that such a thing is possible. "I don't know where to start, "but the fact that you are reading this "means I have somehow found a sympathetic courier. "Therein may be at least the start "I so desperately need. "Whatever the outcome, you have all my love always. William." [Explosion] Oh, shit! Jeez. Ah, nice. Shit. [Motorcycle starts] [Ding] Hmm. Hmm. [Woman] Touch me. [Man] Huh? Touch me. Where? Touch me! Ah! Ah! Oh! There. You're my man. Oh! Oh! Now what are you going to do? You know. What I always do. Oh, yeah! Oh, say it. Say it! I'm going to fuck you. Oh, yeah. Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! [Moaning continues] [Woman] Oh, yeah! Come on, big boy. Oh! What are you doing to me? Shakedown! Let's go! You crazy son of a bitch! You just wait! I'll fix your ass for this! Shit. Ha ha! Where you going, slowpoke? I don't know. Maybe d.J.'S for a drink. The slowpoke has 20 bucks says he gets there first. Don't you think I got enough of your money already? Don't you worry about that, baby. I'll get it all back. Might even get you, too. No way. Devil's already got me. Don't mean nothing to me. I'm going to get you anyway. Yeah? Got to catch me first. [Tires screeching] [Horn honks] [Horn honks] [Horn honks] [Horn honks] That's my girl. It's 20 bucks, sucker. Boy, you just love me taking all your money, don't you? Wait a minute. It ain't over yet. I feel like I'm just getting warmed up. Then what are we stopping for? Just a little break in the action. I figured you could use a pit stop. Why don't we slip inside here and have a couple of drinks? Maybe I'll even show you a few things on that dance floor. You got to be kidding. The one thing I do not kid about is my dancing. See you around, candy-ass. Wasco's not going to like this. Let me just tell you something, o.K.? When you're pulling a scam and you got the pigeon on the slow shuck, you got to stick right with it, just nurse it along nice and easy, let that sucker do whatever makes him happy. Wasco doesn't need you anymore. He's got somebody else bringing it in. I know all about that. But he must still need me for something, or else you wouldn't be here. Maybe I'm here because I want to be. Ha ha ha! Now you got it. See, I'm going to make out like I believe that. Then we can pick it up right where we left off. Just let the sucker take you inside for dancing... Get your hands off me. Baby, you lost it again. Goddamn it, let go of me. What the hell is wrong with you? Are you afraid of me or something? Look at me. Goddamn it, look at me. Goddamn it, never do that again! Goddamn you, fast-walking. 341. Miscount. Bullshit. This count is right. Where's galliot? His cell has been cleaned out. The warden put him in solitary for safekeeping. You're still short one. Now go count them again. Shit! You didn't forget your old cousin, did you? Never count me out. It hurts my feelings. Control, east cellblock count is 342. Right. Yeah, I know. Damn it, last again. What the hell do you do up there-- tuck them in? Goddamn goof-off. What's the matter with you today, George? You look a little wacky. Doesn't he look a little ragged today? Did you get enough sleep last night? Ha ha! I'm warning you, wise guy. You better get on the stick around here. Keep your satch buttoned up, or you'll wish you never put your smart ass in a guard's uniform. Well, I'm doing the very best I can, sergeant. Yeah, we got to give him that, George, considering that he's had a lot on his mind lately. I hear he's even got himself a new girlfriend. Anybody I know? Hey, buddy. Where's galliot? 15. Let me have the keys. What's happening? Trust me. And, uh, turn up your radio, o.K.? On your feet. Let's go. Leave that. You're coming back. Where we going? Nowhere. Listen...I'm probably crazy for doing this, but I'm going to try and get you out of here. You read the letter? She was gone, checked out. They all left town. I don't believe that. Listen, I'm telling you, that's the way it is. You're on your own, and I'm all you've got. O.k. What do we do? Well, the best thing you can do until I figure this whole thing out is to stay alive. That's all? Honestly speaking, don't you think you're just wasting your time? Maybe. You sure as hell got nothing to lose. What about you? When your old lady flew out of town, do you think that 50,000 flew out with her? Would that make a difference? Might make me try a little harder. 50,000. I'm not making any promises. Maybe you better hold on to that till later. I'd rather you try harder now. O.k., now, I figure you're safe as long as you're down here in protective custody, but when you get back up there, you tuck those brothers of yours around you like a blanket and never stick your head out. No one can stick a shank in your ribs or throw you off a tier with that kind of cover. Yeah, I know that, and so do they. Anyway, that's all irrelevant now. They've got something else in mind. Murder would make me a martyr. As much as the movement may want that now, the man doesn't. It has to be an accident. I'm fairly certain that the plan is to escalate this phony race war you've got going here into a full-scale riot in the big yard so some overanxious tower guard in the line of duty can fire into the crowd. There's your accident, but no martyr. We may be in better shape than we think because it'd take one hell of a marksman to pick you off in that crowd, and there's only one hack in this whole joint who's good enough to do it. Who's that? Me. Phony or not, with only one killing? So until some whitey gets iced next, we got time for me to work out a plan. We're fine. Aah! Aah! [Thud] Where do you suppose wasco is, huh, squeeze? [Door opens] You know, sometimes I think I might have made a big mistake, that I missed my calling. I should have taken the cloth, gone ahead and been a preacher. It's true. I never told anybody this before, but I've often felt the call to enlighten you to the most important thing there is in the world. Do you know what that is? Blood. Yes, blood. It's what makes US what we are, our disposition, our temperament, maybe most of all, our passion. Something we can't change flowing through US, never changing its course. Parental heritage. Family line. What we call kinship, because that's what we are-- kin, connected from birth. The same life blood. Think about it. There is no way in the world you are going to get me to kill that man, and you know it. You're not thinking about the same blood. It makes US do the same things, want the same things. It's been that way ever since we were kids. Think about this institution that we make our home. Think about moke... Our little moke, whom we love so very much. We would do anything in the world for her, wouldn't we? Some men--most men-- resent this kind of thing, would kill over things like this-- their own kin fooling around with their old lady. Oh, shit. Ha ha! Oh. But I understand it, and you understand it. You understand the excitement of taking something that doesn't belong to you, don't you? Makes your blood rush and throb in the face of all that danger. I'm thinking about it right now. I'm not ashamed to admit it. I'm pulsing and throbbing and rushing in the face of all that danger ahead of US. I got to admit-- you were right about one thing. You should have been a preacher because never since I been in church have I ever heard one man lay down so much shit. But don't let me stop you. You're going kind of good. I'd like to hear some more. The whole thought just walked right by you, didn't it? You're not paying attention. You're not really listening. Like in church, you're not thinking clearly. If you were, you wouldn't be backing the wrong team. You wouldn't be betting on the wrong horse. You'd be with the people that love you, your family, your country, your lord. And yes, for once, the lord is on our side. Maybe you better get him on that gun walk with a rifle because it's going to take a miracle to pull this off without me. Oh, you will be up there. It won't be any miracle. It's all part of the grand design, all carefully worked out so that everybody has what they want, what they need, what they must have-- love and money and positive action in defense of racial Harmony and a better america. Yeah. Something for everyone. What do you figure is in it for me? Love and money. Maybe I got that already. You may have. Holding on to it... Is something else. You see, the master plan takes into consideration a very complex and far-reaching design, reaching way back into those dark places that you can't count on, reaching out even to take my little moke away from you. Is that a fact? Yes, it is, a very painful and distressing fact. There's a contract out on her... Quite like Mr. Galliot... Something I had to search the very depths of my soul to allow, something I couldn't have done without faith and belief. I believe everything I'm saying to you. I have faith in you, my cousin. I know that you're going to remember that there isn't anything in this world that's as thick as family blood and that you will do what has to be done to get the contract off that little girl's head. You're going to pay for this, motherfucker. Believe me. You're going to pay. Of course I am. I always intended to. I wouldn't expect you to do something like this for nothing. You'll be a rich man. You can walk right out of here, never worry about anything as long as you live, and maybe even have the most wonderful girl in the world. Do me a favor and watch the car. I got to pick something up. Need help? It might be heavy. I can handle it. Just watch this meter. It's a $15 fine. O.k., but just give me a dime. Well, why waste a dime? Just keep an eye on the meter. Northbound interstate coach 435 departs from Lane two. That's northbound to modesto, stockton, Sacramento, yuba city, chico, enterprise, medford, Eugene, Portland, and all Oregon points. That's your final call for northbound interstate coach 435 in Lane two. All aboard. Excuse me. Uh, let's see if I got this right. You're, um, Elaine shakter? Schecter. That's right. And, uh, those dudes hanging around the doors are not waiting for the next bus out of here. That's right. Whoever showed up at that locker read the letter like you figured since he couldn't deliver it. Once he knows there's a lot of bread offered, he signs up with Mr. Galliot. You're still batting 1.000. Now it would be hard to leave with that 50 grand unless I tell you what you're waiting to hear. If William gave you the key, the money's yours. That makes it harder, doesn't it? Which means you have nothing to tell US. Nothing you'll want to hear. You evidently told William something he wanted to hear. Hey, look, Ms. Shakter, whatever your name is, I told him up front I was making no promises, and that was when there was enough time for me to figure out how to get him out. Now what? You're running out of time, or you haven't really got a way out? That's it. Both. All right. You told me what I wanted to hear. And now I can tell you that we don't need you to figure a way out. We never did. That's been done quite some time ago. I'm real curious to hear how you'll do it. Oh, you'll know as soon as I tell you what your part in the plan is-- that is, assuming you want to keep that key. Just tell me, and we'll find out. Just two things--you must be on tower duty at the number-eight post when the time comes. What's the other thing? Lower the key to William so he can get through the big yard door. That's all. Oh, is that all? Will you do that? Wait. Let's just back it up a little bit and see if I will be able to do it. Since I can only drop that key to an officer, he'll have to be in a guard uniform. That's right. Which means that he'd be impersonating a guard in the joint, who would have to make himself scarce at the time... Ha ha ha! Which he ain't going to do unless he's been told in advance. Of course. So I take it this has already been arranged. That's right. Well, this is getting interesting. Let me see if I can figure out who it is. With your Mr. Galliot being of the black persuasion, that narrows down the field considerably. And since we're dealing with the east block, where there's only one guard who's black... Oh, I'd have to take a wild guess and come up with my good friend officer Jackson. Exactly. Who just happens to be waiting for me. Are you sure? Ha ha! Well, today has just been one big kick in the ass after the other. There's an amazing resemblance to William, don't you think? You know US rednecks-- we never could tell one from another. That's exactly what we're counting on. O.k. O.k. Well, I might as well hear the rest. Does that mean you'll do it? Lady, if you can get him to that door, the least I can do is drop the key. Good. Good. When's all this going to come off? As soon as he gets out of solitary. You said yourself there's very little time left. That's tomorrow. Well, then, it will have to be tomorrow. Ha ha! Well. Why are you smiling? I was thinking about all that's going to go down tomorrow, especially when you think what the other side has planned. And you find that amusing? Wouldn't you... If you had the contract to kill him? See you on park Avenue, kid. [Laughing] Did you see the look on her face? Like a ship in the night hit by a torpedo. That's the best news I've heard all day. Wasco really come through for US. He put the whole situation right in your hands. He put something else in my hands, too-- the life of that little girl. Hey, man, you don't believe that shit. That's his old lady. It's a long story, but believe me, he would ice her. I can't let that happen. The way I see it, we'll have the dude out before wasco knows what's happening. You can stash that chick where nobody can find her, maybe even Oregon. Yeah. Yeah, maybe. There's one thing no one's told me. How will you get galliot into that uniform and across that yard? Hey, don't you worry about that. That's all taken care of. You just be thinking about dropping that key. Say I do it. He's out, but you're still inside. How will you explain? I'm going to be clean, man. I'm the one that's going to call control. Maybe too late, but I will call control and tell them what happened. They'll know the hospital called for me to rush over there. My wife is having the baby, right? It's the first time I'm hearing it. Tell me. I'll tell them when I got to the yard door, I decided to call the hospital. It's a natural thing to do. I'll call just to have it on record. The hospital will tell me there's been some kind of mistake. There's no Jackson in the place. Then, the conscientious pig that I am, I call control and blow the whistle, which is something I'll be just as clean as. Ha ha ha! Goddamn, man. I think you got them beat! We got it locked. We can't lose. And think about all that money. Oh, they straightening you, too? Hey, once we get him out, the eagle will fly for old Jackson. Maybe fly right on up to Oregon, huh? Ha ha ha! Oh, goddamn. Ohh...wasco, you son of a bitch. Oh! Oh! Ole. Ha ha ha! [Men shouting approval] [Speaking Spanish] [Playing Mexican music] Look what that brother of mine's gone and done-- he's made me a queen. That's what he told me-- something for everyone. There's something inside for you, too. All right, hot pants, the party's over. Get the boys back in the truck. [Sanger] O.k., back in the truck. Kind of late for them pickers, ain't it? They got a new girl in there? Yeah. It's a special day for them. It's a special day for you, too. I told you if you stayed close to your cuz, all your troubles would be over. Here it is. Want to open it? I know what's in it. 25 thou, kid. You want to touch it? You want to feel the green? How come you got it? I thought moke was bringing it. She did. Well, where is she? What is the difference? You shouldn't be thinking about that trash, anyway. Evie, she must have told you where she was going. Listen, kid, there's one thing about women that you've got to learn. Now, I hate to be the one to have to tell you this, but deep down under, they're no different than an alley cat. They ain't gonna stick around if you don't come through for them. What are you talking about? I'm talking about you standing up to wasco. That little hustler of yours has got some romantic notion that you're different from every other guy. She thinks you let her down. Who the hell else does she think I'm doing this for-- that asshole of a brother of yours? For Christ's sakes, what does she want? Right now, I'd settle for a little hot water. All right...That's it. Clean as you're ever going to get. What's the big hurry? We're not going anywhere. Not going anywhere? What are you talking about? Don't you know what today is? Today's the day that old fast-walking hit the jackpot. We got some real celebrating to do, so get your little ass in there and get dressed, and I'm going to show you the goddamnedest time you ever had in your whole life. How's that? Forget it. I already had that in there. You know, they should have called you fast-talking because that's all you ever do! When it comes down to it, you don't deliver. And do you know why? Because you're weak. I should have known just looking at your face-- "weak" written all over it! Everything about you is weak, and so is everything you do. That includes last night, in case you think that was anything special. Baby, I know what you're talking about, and I can dig it. I admit I'd feel the same way if I was you. That's because I haven't had the chance before to show you what you been looking for. Goddamn it, tonight you're going to see it. You'll see for the first time that it ain't all talk. Old fast-walking going into action, right out on that dance floor! âª Da da da da âª Everything you been looking for, showing you where my real strength is. You ain't got long to wait because that's where we're headed now. That's what you think. You're getting out of here! Baby, I really don't mind waiting. Go change. Jesus Christ, will you get off it? It is over! Baby, it ain't over, nowhere near. In fact, it's just beginning. Relax. You got a long night ahead of you. That's what you think. I am spending the night here alone. If you want to go dancing, take those assholes with you. Excuse me? The two guys waiting down in the street. What are you talking about? Who are those guys? I don't know. Have you ever seen them before? Do you know what they're doing there? Do you want to play 20 questions or do something about them? Play 20 questions? Oh, for Christ's sake! I'll go downstairs, have a talk with them, and straighten this out. Just a minute. You want me to kill these guys? It's a tranquilizer gun. I won't even ask. What is that? A little thorazine. Is it dangerous? Nope. Just puts them to sleep. O.k., turn out the light. Ow! [Fast-walking laughs] [Fast-walking] That's the craziest thing I ever saw in my life. This one's mine. Well, look at that. [Laughing] Still want to stay here alone? You still want to go dancing? Isn't this where I came in? Right back where we started. So what do we do now? Wait for tomorrow. Did you ever kill anyone? No. Going to tomorrow? No. Then what are we waiting for? To see how it all comes out. How do you see it? I see you... I see me. I see getting that dude out tomorrow. I see all that money in that box over there. I see Oregon. I see it all. Tomorrow. That's not what I see. What do you see? I see you... I see me... I see all that money in that box over there. I see Oregon right out that door, right now, tonight... But I don't see tomorrow. Got to be tomorrow. Going to pull it off. Going to get you out of here. I guarantee it. Solid gold... Tomorrow. No sale, eh? Well, let's take another look. You know what I see now? A loser. A beautiful... Tall...Good-looking... Fast-talking, fast-walking loser... Dreaming about that big day, always waiting for tomorrow... When he gets his big chance to blow the whole thing. Wants to blow it so bad, he wouldn't miss it for anything or anybody... Even wants his little moke to stay around and help him do it... Help him make that big dream come true. [Sigh] That's what I see now. Oh, well, don't you worry. Your little moke's going to be right here, going to help her baby make all his dreams come true... Tomorrow... Why the m-16? Because it's an automatic. It only takes one shot. That's for damn sure. I've seen the boy nail a garbage-dump sea gull, 150 yards, in flight. Nobody like him. Of course, on the other hand, you never know what them rag-heads are going to do when their massa gets offed. It might take a considerable amount of fire power just to calm them down a little, you know? I don't want to know none of the details. Just get the job done. Where's galliot? I haven't seen him around. What's the matter? Getting anxious? Well, there's no show without him, is there? Come on. It's going to be easy. When everybody's out in the yard, they let him out of solitary, and that's when we take him. Can't have more than two people around him. I'll slide over and cheap-shot some nigger. They'll go crazy, and you'll have a clear shot. I can hardly wait. I bet. I mean, she is some sweet stuff. Makes it all worthwhile. Got the money, didn't you? Yeah. Most wonderful girl in the world. All tied up, ready to be delivered-- unless, of course, if... If... I didn't think you were going to forget the other "if." Don't worry, cuz. He's as good as gone. All right. Three to a group. Don't forget. Three to a group. Why should you be different? [Bird flies away] O.k., let's go. Time for a little exercise. [Elaine] Yes, I'd advise him to be here as soon as possible. Thank you. They buy it? Control is calling him out of solitary now. Good. You sure miniver's going to lower that key? Honey, all you've got to do is pick him up. [Ring] Solitary. Sergeant sanger. What do you mean, an emergency? Yeah, he's right here, but this is a hell of a time for that. Yes, sir, um, I'll tell him. Right away. Yes, sir. Of all the fucking times! What the hell's he doing so far away? You kidding? With his eye? Come on. Let's go. Wait. [Telephone ringing] Tower eight. Miniver. Yeah. Yeah, o.K. I'll let him out. Did you inform the other wall post? Thanks. O.k. All right. Let's do it. Say, nigger... I got your watermelon. Pants. Hey, Sam! I'm coming through the yard now. I know. Control just called me. Five bucks it's a girl. Make it 10. I want to get even for the last time. You got it. [Rifle cocks] There's an officer coming through. Break it up! [Blows whistle] Break it up! [Blowing whistle] All right. Break it up! Come on. Move it. Come on. Break it up here. Come on. Three to a crowd. Hey, Jackson, name it after me! Come on. Come on, baby. Fuck you, wasco. Piece of cake. Like a walk in the park. All right. I blew it. That's one for you. Turn him loose. Hey! [Elaine] Hi, baby. [Elaine screams] [Man] Galliot! Oh, no! Oh, no. No. You ever hear of the owyhee river? Up along the south fork. They sell the land for dirt-cheap. Even got an Indian reservation here somewhere, uh, fort... What is it? Mcdermitt. So, look...Get ourselves a couple of cold bitches-- two or three to a man-- then just Indian it out. Squaw it out through the winter. How's that sound? [Wasco] I'm going to come up and see you guys. How'd you like that? Old wasco organizing them red motherfuckers. Put some of them squaws on the street. There's money in that. Yes, I think I will do that. Got my pardon coming through any day. You didn't know that, did you? Sorry, squeeze. I know you'll miss your old man. I may get up there before you guys, take my little moke with me, get those squaws started. Don't you get down on that girl, you know. She was just doing what she was told. You didn't know that, either, did you? The old master plan. Remember? Wasco's grand design. Oh, yes! I knew. I knew right from the start you'd never blow that cat away. I was counting on it. I just knew that my little cousin would have his own scam to deliver that nigger right to where moke could do her number. Oh, please. You got to understand something. The way I look at things is that it's a big game, like the Olympics. The black man ends up losing in the end. It's been planned that way. God's greater scheme of things. Galliot knew it. Sure, he did. I can--i can just see him as he was going down, tipping his hat to the better man. He knew all that nigger-baiting shit. That's all just part of the sport. Nothing heartfelt. Nothing personal about it at all. Just like little moke. She was doing what her old man told her. Can't fault a bitch for that. What else are they about? O.k., tier men, let's go. Fourth tier to chow first. All right. Outside! Oh, yes. Lord Jesus, help me. I do love it in this joint. What's going on, cousin? Hey, man. Hey, man. Are you with me? I'm with you, brother. Should we do it? Should we? [Wasco laughing] Whooee. Let's do it, Sylvester. Hey, man... What do you need, brother? Whatever it is... The joint's got it. Right on, brother! Well, give me some loud-ass skin.
