Francisco! You feel bad? I can not get up. Your fasting has been too long this time, Brother Francisco, in seven days you have not eaten more than half a loaf. Let's get him out. Wait, wait. Before I'll tell you something, as I prayed I was given to understand that the Lord wants us to stop here. And with what purpose, brother Francisco? I do not know. What might need the Lord from us, here in this land? For now, obedience. Do not worry prematurely. The Lord will take care of marking the road. Brother Francisco, if we stay here because God wants it, I think starved we would be of no use to Him. We'll look for work, but before we'll go to the charity of the people. I'm afraid there is too much competition, and charity is always short. Charity can also be infected, let's begin setting the pace. So, you have something to change, pilgrim? Yes, I think so. What is it, a relic? My hunger by a good bread, do you think? A charity, for charity! For the love of God, brother! On behalf of the Lord, a charity! A handout, by God! In the name of the Lord, a charity! I'm a pilgrim and I come from far away. This is the annoying thing of pilgrimages, the poor ones, why don't they do something to stop them? Many years ago the Lord gave the solution. Peace be with you. And also with you. You want? A charity, on behalf of the Lord. You arrive on time. Master Mateo, stonemason of the temple of Santiago, just collected his salary, and can give you a coin. Master Mateo, sorry, I can not accept money in charity. That's not very common. My lady, holy poverty, has forbidden me. I just need a piece of bread. I can not offer that, here there are only stones. Okay, your will is good and that's enough. God be with you. Wait! Maybe I can give you something. If you want to take some figs... Why not? They're welcome. In that case, come with me. You can help yourself as you please. I do not usually lie, these figs are the best around this contour, you can check. Wonderful fruit those from this fig tree! I told you so, and that the best, disappear as if by sorcery! Surely someone takes them. Over two years I followed him, but I failed to see one hair. Must be a rogue. The day I catch him, I promise he will remember all his life Master Mateo. In me there is no making fun! As I catch him! Look what I been given, bread and nuts. I bring figs, and you? Forgive me, Francisco, I've eaten everything they gave me, I was starving. Well done, the gospel commands us not to save anything for tomorrow, so you've accomplished! Do not worry, we will divide this among the three of us. Hello! Hello! I'm glad to see you again, so I can thank you for not having discovered me before Master Mateo. It would haven't been right after the work it have cost you to catch them. Uh! You've made me a scare ... I nearly fell from the top of the fig tree. What's your name? Cotolaya, like my grandfather, but loggers call me Cotolay. Brothers, I have the great honor to introduce Cotolay. Hello, Cotolay. Want more figs? These are the fattest. No, no, leave it. Hey, don't be shy, you miss them. Thanks, Cotolay. You're welcome, a favor for another favor. Alfonso of Andrade, falconer of the noble house of Sotomayor, seeking the services of one who understands hawk hunt, offering shelter and food, in addition to six marks, plus some clothes, and many other imposts, from who'll be his master, and lord. There is none among you who have knowledge of those duties and wants to earn those six marks? Jacobo! Master Tarna sent so you tell a pry for him. How much will he pay me? If you get what he wants, two Leon marks. It depends on the matter. He needs four more loggers. In that case, I give the two marks for lost, no one will go. You preach, and we'll see. Well, well. You'll see now. It takes four lumberjacks to Mount Pedroso! That forest is haunted! The haunted one will be you! Anyone who goes picks up the fever. Those are legends. Come on, come on! It takes four lumberjacks! Good house, good food, good salary! You call good home a leaky hut? And good food to the trash old Cotolaya cooks? What do you have to say about my grandfather? Nothing, nothing, but I was there two months, and see how they left me! Drop it, Jacobo. I told you nobody would want to go, you just see. Hello, I come to fetch you. May I ask why? You see, I have come to Santiago because I lack loggers to Mount Pedroso. You're not going to tell us that you've thought of us for that? Yes, that's exactly what I wanted. We, lumberjacks? Do you think we could be usefull? Well, I thought ... it's always better something than nothing. Is it far that forest? No, not very far, a little over half mile, between Valdedi?s and Valdelinfierno (Godway and Hellway) Valdedi?s and Valdelinfierno ... I think the waiting has been short. The Lord began to lead the way. So, okay? Yes We live from our work too. What are you laughing at? From the face Master Tarna will show when he sees you. I do not think they'll admit us. Hey, here comes Cotolay, and brings reinforcements. Hello, Cotolay! Finally you deliver my order? Yes, Master Tarna. Here I bring you what you commision me. The truth, I've seen in my life strange people, but as these three ... Believe it or not, I think they'll be good cutters. You think? Yes, brother. Be careful, Tarna, they may be three repentant thieves. They are true pilgrims, and if they apply for loggers, nothing else matters. Yes, yes, but I would not trust. It is such true what Vidal says, criminals today are the only pilgrims who come here with the intention of penitents, I would not trust too. Okay ... Well, anyway, for they have come, it's fair we talk. How much you want to earn? We will work solely for food and shelter. Do you see? Man who doesn't want pay is untrustworthy, Tarna. You must admit, they are the only ones who want to work. Yes, the kid is right, fellow, we need help and we are not in time to choose. Well, we'll do the test. Give them your ax. What should I do? Do you dare to that? With two of you soon we would left the forest as palms. You're worth for four, my boy! Martin, I think you've lost the post. Let us see what you are capable. Very little, Master Tarna, except from working in the kitchen, I don't see another thing I might help you. But what I need are lumberjacks. You already have what you asked. Where? You just said this one is worth four, these are not the ones you need? Devil boy! He always finds a solution to fit him. I suppose you too want to peel thistles in the kitchen. Why not? This is about our profession. Okay, you can stay. Master Tarna!, since you admitted them, you owe me two Leon marks. And why that? These you offer Jacobo to pick loggers, and it was me who found them. Well, well, we'll talk about it, now take them staying. Grandpa, Grandpa! What, Cotolay? Why such shouting? I bring a new lumberjack. A new logger? Oh, man, it's good. His name is Francisco. Francisco? And this is a lumberjack? Well, he will help you at the kitchen. MasterTarna tells you to give them shelter. Ah, if Maese Tarna tells, you are welcome. I will try to help you best. We'll see ... Do not pay much attention if he gets angry sometimes. That is my cabin. You're in luck. My grandfather will treat you well. What's wrong? You feel bad? It's nothing, a little tired. Salt and vinegar, with that Grandpa heals me the wounds. Go on, put your feet, don't be afraid. It hurts a little at first, but soon passes by. He has extensive experience in this, every now and then he has some part of his body stuck in the bowl. Is he that naughty? You do not know. Since his parents died peace is over for me, he seeks complications and seeks them for me too, and when I try to scold him, he always finds some excuse so I have to believe him. The boys have to be naughty but what is not right is to lie, Cotolay. You cooked too little dinner, Grandpa. There will be enough for everyone. For me do not worry, I'm not hungry. You've just said it's wrong to lie. You will be with us long? I do not know, it's not up to me. I'm just a server. Cotolay! Cotolay! Cotolay! You called me, Grandpa? How do you come so? Where were you? I was hunting and fell into the river. Hunting ... Guess what? If you don't call me, I almost bring Quebo. And why do not you bring him? It is that he does not allow to be catched. Go, go, go and dry off. You have to help Francisco, keep the food for loggers. Go, go! Very good! What are you doing there? Do not you have been told to go and dry off? Now go. What are you doing? Cotolay! I do not like these jokes. Do not get mad, Grandpa, I just wanted to try the sandals to Francisco. Do not get mad ... You always test this way your customers? If they stand still, no. Tell me, is it a work of yours? Yes, it did not want you to go barefoot. Tomorrow I will make other ones to Bernardo, and then to Juan. Thanks, Cotolay, the Lord will repay you. Hey, if I ask the Lord to let me hunt Quebo the deer, you think I will grant it? If so desired, hunt him soon, Cotolay, lest Dimo anticipate. Who's Dimo? A bloodthirsty wolf. May San Diago want you not to stumble upon him, he is very cunning. When he does any of his tricks, he runs to Valdelinfierno to take refuge in, there in the swamp he feels safe. Go, Cotolay, dry off at once!, You have to bring the food. Yes, Grandpa. But what's wrong with you today, Martin? Nothing. Beware the tree! Hey, do you think? Tree goes! The food!, here comes the food! The food! Good morning, Martin, how's it going? Go to hell, and leave me alone. What's wrong with Martin? He's in a bad mood. He has bet a hen with winea that he was able to cut six trees more than Juan of Florence. He still has two to reach him and can do no more. Today I want nothing with the stew, man!, I bet we're going to eat chicken! Already, this is the chicken of the bet. How am I going to laugh seeing the face of that beast! Hey, Martin!, next time we'll double the bet, with only one we don't have enough. Martin will win the next time beacause I'll help him. You help me, toad? Have you taken me by an old woman?, now you'll see what I can do. I can do it on myself; see if I need your help, look! Yes, me alone. And now let that one show what is he capable. Get up, get up, come on! Juan, that force you show you have received from God, and if you received it from Him, why do you boast of it? Forgive me, Francisco, I should not do, I am a calamity. Forgive me you too, Martin. Enough of such forgiveness and so much bravado, Depart ye from here the two, out!, out! Do not get close to him, he got the swamp fever. I will really miss that brute. Martin is strong. Is that you know of someone who had coped with the fever? Leave it now, talking does not remedy anything. Do not be sad, Juan, you have no guilt. I'm sure it was the effort of the bet what put him so. No, Juan, fevers have nothing to do with it. Fill 'er up, he's not yet dead. Cotolay, come to bed. Allow me for little while, Grandpa, I want to know how is Martin. You'll just know tomorrow. Go, Cotolay, obey your grandfather, go to bed. Well, see you tomorrow. Goodbye, Cotolay. How is him? Will he get all right? Be calm, everything is on its way, now we can only wait for the fever to break, You can rest easy. Follow me. While tending to Martin, I think I could sense something of the Lord's desires. Help me to implore him to enlighten us. I believe the Lord has deigned to let me know his will. As you know, we have now lived in shacks made of reeds and mud there in Assisi and from them we started to travel the world, taking our message of holy poverty and charity. Although we're done here loggers. It is possible that the Lord has made use of that road to tell us he wants us to stop our order being pilgrim and gain stability. We must found monasteries. Found convents? That is against our rules, they say we can not own anything. Fear not, the Lord wills it, and he will find the means to obtain it without it being ours. Even more difficult. His desire is that we found the first convent of my order here at Santiago de Compostela. It may not be, we do not have any means. I do not see how we can build this monastery, it is almost impossible. Brothers, such little faith, if it's the Lord who wants, it will be built, so I believe it will be built! Come on, guys, hard on him! Look, here comes Martin! About time! What's the matter? Is that you have never been late and fallen asleep? You have not fallen asleep, Martin, For two days and two nights you suffered the swamp fever. You guys are crazy, if I had been attacked by the fevers I would be dead. Come on, as we all took you for deceased! Francisco has spent with you two nights and two days. That's true, Martin. And maybe I was the culprit for that stupid bet. That's enough, and I assure you that who will repeat that thing of the fevers I'll split his head with an ax! And if it is Francisco who is asking you? Francisco, Francisco, bah! That Italian hath bewitched you all! Go to hell with him! Bernardo, Francisco, Grandpa! What? Martin has gone to work, he is cured! Is that true? - Sure! - But until last night he got the fever! For it is the truth, now I do not lie. Francisco, you have not heard? Martin is cured, has gone to work. Yeah. Did you already know? Hey, Francisco, why you were not surprised by Martin's cure? It is that last night you were praying for him, right? Tell me, why you stay so long looking into heaven? I wait. And it's the same voice you heard last night and told you about the convent? Well, I've just imagined you had been listening. I should not do, I know. But, you really talked to the Lord? Yes He is hoping that everyone will talk to Him. And are not you afraid? No. If it was me, I would fall ... Lie down. Francisco, and what do you feel when you talk to him? Then I feel my soul fills with joy. Shh, hush! What? It's him, sure is! Who? Look, there he is. It's Quebo, don't let him see you. When I approach him, he escapes. Maybe because you are hiding from him. How do you know? Quebo believes that all who approach him hiding nothing good want from him. Happy days, brother deer, you do not have to flee, Quebo, Cotolay wants to be your friend. Hello, Quebo. Come Cotolay, Quebo awaits. Courage, Cotolay, fear not. You see? This is how we all can talk to the Lord, if we approach him with love and trust. Quebo is my friend! Quebo is my friend! Grandfather, Bernardo, grandfather, Quebo is my friend! Look, there! I would never have believed it. How did you get it? It was not me, it was Francisco, he told him that I wanted to be his friend. I never imagined you could get such a thing. To Francisco, nothing is difficult. I just put my poor will, and God does the rest. Well, I think you're going to need His help for that you claim about the convent. We talked about it, he says he knows a place where it could be build. That's right. Do you think? I do not think it's a bad place. We could reconstruct at least part. I thought about that when I spoke of this site. Our convent should be small and poor. About being poor ok, Francisco, but as for extension ... As big as a simple cabin will be enough. Do not worry so much about the future, Bernardo, Be confident. When our order increases, and the brothers begin to stumble on each other, they will take upon themselves to widen it as needed. For me, honestly, I do not like this site. Cotolay! I would like that the convent was new, and that it was in a funny place. Yes, but it will be more costly to do so. That would not be an obstacle, if it's true what they say, about here is a great hidden treasure. A treasure? Yes, they say it was hidden during the invasion of Mansur. If we found it, we could make the convent, and much more! You may be surprised, Cotolay, if I tell you that last night I also dreamed of a treasure. A treasure? As the one grandfather says here is buried? It was wonderful. Its light hurt my eyes so, that I even feel pain in them. Sometimes seemed something like material treasure, and others were blurred to achieve an unmatched purity. You see such weird things I tend to dream? I would like to dream about this treasure too. I also dreamed that our little convent would be up in a happy place, as Cotolay says. I just close my eyes to see it. What's wrong? You feel bad? Nothing, nothing. You must not worry. Grandpa! Cotolay, warns Juan, soon! Cotolay, do not get close to Francisco! Get out of there. You should not have approached, it is dangerous. I'm not afraid, and you can not hurt me. It's dangerous. Juan and Bernardo will bring you to Santiago, to the pilgrims' hospital, there they will cure the fevers. Soon you'll be well, Francisco. Help me! No, no! Do not worry, I told you that they're bringing you. No, not that, Cotolay, it is that I have to fulfill the mandate of the Lord, I must build my convent, I must. Do not worry about the convent, if you can not, I will do, I promise! I must do, my convent ... Help me, help me! Cotolay, I told you not to go near Francisco. I am sorry to leave you, friends, but we must go with him. I understand, we wish he gets cured soon, and whether you want to come back with my men, count on me. Thanks, Master Tarna. Cotolay! Cotolay! Ah, you there? Go, go. Come closer. What do you hid behind your back? Nothing. Something in your hands you do not want me to see, Show me. If it's nothing, grandfather. I told you to show! Blessed be God, but what have you done with your hands? Dig. I am looking for the treasure of Al-Mansur, you said it was hidden among the ruins. Yes, well, I said what I had heard. And do not you think it is true? Francisco also spoke of the treasure. Well, why, and if true, is that you pretend to find it in a moment? Come, come, let's go home we must heal those hands. Such a kid! So you think you can find a treasure like that? Put your hands in, do not be afraid, it's only vinegar with salt, what, hurts, right? Yes, but I endure. What you have to do is forget this treasure forever . I need it to build the convent of Francisco. But you know what you say? A convent ... I promised him, and you've always said that a man should keep his word. True, but when the word is striving for something very serious, do you understand?, not on a fantasy. It is not a fantasy, Grandpa. Yes sir, yes. Yes it is. No, Grandpa! Go tomorrow to Santiago, and ask your friend Francisco to dispense you of that word, and to understand that you're not a man yet. I can not. Why? You said that I must not approach Francisco because he has the fever. In this case, can you say it to Bernardo?. Well, I'll tell him, least so that I am not a man!, because that absolutely is not true! Well, well, okay, it seems alright for me, great man! I love you, Grandpa! Francisco! I thought I won't find you. Hello, Cotolay. Why did you come? I have to tell you something, grandfather's things. What's wrong with grandpa? He caught me in the ruins searching for the treasure and became angry, he says that this treasure does not exist! Yes, Cotolay, it does exist. Is that right? You said it! But this treasure is not hidden in the ruins of nowhere, it is inside ourselves, and that is where we have to look, Cotolay, it is the faith, love for God, humility, poverty, obedience, everything that has to lead his way, is our true treasure, do you understand? And with that you can build not only a convent, but the whole world. Although you may be already regretting having given me your word? Of course not! So I come to say that I already have an idea for the start. - Cotolay! - Hi, Bernardo! What are you doing here? I came to talk to Francisco, and I'm glad I did. I'm off. I'll be not long to bring you news. Bye! Quebo! I have seen Francisco! Quebo! Where are you? Quebo! Quebo ... Who did it? Tell me. It was Dimo, right? Dimo! Dimo! Help! Get me out of here! Help! Grandpa! Hello, son. How are you? I'm all right, Grandpa. Herminio, the hunter, get you out of the swamp when you were about to drown. Say, what were you doing there? Looking for Dimo, which has killed Quebo. Oh dear! Do not think more, that can not be helped. No, not that, I'm thinking of something else. What about? Tell me, grandfather, what should I do to talk to the abbot of St. Martin? Hey, hey, can I know what you want to talk to Mr. abbot? Cotolay, do not start over, do not start, There you go again with that nonsense about the treasure hunt? Didn't you talk to Francisco? Yes, that's why I want to talk to the abbot. Good morning, Cotolaya. Hello, Herminio. How are you, Cotolay? Well, thanks for the swamp thing. Nothing, man, what is needed is that you do not come back there. That thing is dangerous, as you saw. Maybe you can pay me the favor some day ... You wanted something, Herminio? Here, I want you to sharp them. Oh yeah, what more could one ... And after what you have done for my grandson I'll not charge you absolutely nothing, nothing. The other day I saw your grandson digging in the ruins. What? He found something? But, is that you too are going to believe in the legend of the treasure? I ask out of curiosity. Ignore the grandfather, you and I believe in that treasure, right? Yes Perhaps we find it. I go, Grandpa. Where are you going? I think, when you want to talk to someone important you have to bring something to be well received. If you are asking for something, it is most convenient. Why you ask? What a way to draw is that, what do you want? First, the ways that belong to your dressing, and then to talk to the abbot. Yes, very easy, no more than call, say you want to talk to the abbot, and talk to him, right? And can you tell me why? For a private matter between him and me. In that case, get out, I've got plenty to do. But again, son? Now what? I've lost ... I lost it! Have you lost it? What have you lost? Well, that! You bumped me with the door when you closed it, and I lost it. If you tell me what you want, maybe I'll find it, and so you leave me alone. I've lost it... But tell me what you're looking for. I'm looking for the abbot! Stop, stop! What? What is this? What happens? Who is this guy? He knocked rudely and brashly slipped using my good faith. You, kid, come here immediately! Come here, unless you want me to bring you by an ear, Come here, I say! Hurry! Let's see, what do you want? Be careful, father, do not trust, maybe there he brings something possessed. They are figs. Well, yes, they are figs. The best there are, from Master Mateo's fig tree. Well, what have those figs to do with you've entered so? They are for the boss around here. Well that's me. You own all that land out there? No, these lands are not my property, are the community's. Many people's, no? Yeah, sure, but I am who represent them, unfortunately. Anyway, I need some of those lands. And what for do you want them? I need them to build a convent. A convent? Yes, a convent. Come on son, go, go away and take the figs. Devil boy, what an idea ... In my life heard such nonsense. A convent! ... How was the fishing? Too bad, father, I could not get a single trout. What a pity, today I had wanted to eat a couple of those fish. Finally, some other time. How much field will you give me if I bring a basket full of trout? A basket full of fish for a field? Does not it seem a bit uneven proposition? Not to me. No? Well, to me, it does. Hey, won't you even give me what I could measure with a bull skin? You'll settle for so little? Yes, I need no more. Being so ... I do suppose you'll not get back. No way. Deal. Agreed. Go, go! - Hello! - What do you want? Do you like figs? Ok. They are very good, you want one? Ok. Where do you caught so many trout? My father fishes them up there in the Zarela. And where do you bring them? I'm going to sell them at Santiago. Hey, you know that these figs are good? Give me another. If you want, I'll trade them all for a basket of trout. How many? I can not count. Give them to me, I'll count them for you. Do not eat them! Before that you gotta give me the basketfull of trout! But what do you think? That I was going to trade? Come! Go, go! Do not be afraid, that wolf is my friend. If he's your friend tell him to leave. Go, Dimo! He says he does not leave until I do. Well, leave. It's just that I'm not leaving until you pay the figs you've eaten. Truth, Dimo? But if I thought paying you!, take as much as you want. Come, take them! Come! Come on, hurry! Do not touch me, man! Come! That's it. What, do I go now? That I would like to know too. He can leave? He says yes. Thank you, Mr. Wolf. God be with you, sir fishmonger. Thanks, Dimo! Good morning, Cotolay. But where did come from so much trout? From the river. And now, will you give me the field? Sure, a deal is a deal. Where do you want to build your convent? Right here. Agreed. Note now the extension, you brought with you the measure? Here. It is possible to take a bull skin there? Yes, Father, the skin is complete, but I've put it into strips so that it could cover more. Well, on this piece missing, I'll put the door of the convent. That's it. For the record, this is not the agreed, but, okay, you have the land. Now what? Well, now I will run to the hospital to tell Francisco. Francisco? Francisco of Assisi. And who is this Francisco? Someone important? You bet, he came from outside of Rome, as a pilgrim, and wants to found a monastery here, and as he is sick, I'm going to rise it for him. Pretty promise, but how can you build it? I have the Lord's favor. Do you think? If you had caught a dozen trout, we would have avoided all this. There, in that bed, was Francisco. He's in the back room. I am ready, you can speak. The fever has seriously affected your sight. That means I can go blind forever? There is still a slight hope but I have to burn. Will it be much painful? Yes, I have to burn from the eye to the ear, will you have the courage? I'm afraid not, but if necessary, do it, and do it soon. We will have to hold him. No, you will not. If flesh is not well burnt, reapply cautery. It is not necessary for now, you can bandage him. Francisco ... Were you there, Cotolay? Yes, I do not know how you've been able to stand it, but if it serves you to see again ... Do not lose hope, Cotolay, the important thing is you've got the land for our convent. Yes It's bad you can not see it, the abbot said it was yours, here it is. No, Cotolay, this land will always belong to the Benedictines, with the freedom to leave us without it as they see fit. Now we've made it good!, with the work that has costed me ... Do not get mad, Cotolay, we have taken a vow of poverty, and we can not do otherwise. Bernardo, Juan... Say, Francisco. So that they can never said that this land is our property, it must be included in the document of utilization; the obligation to deliver to the monastery as a rent a basket of fish like Cotolay gave the abbot. So be it. Hey, it's you who's in charge here? That's right, boy. Me, when I want something, I always look for the boss. That means that you are asking me something. You guessed it right away. And what do you want?, Because here ... That's what I want, stones. Ah, you want them for your slingshot? Well, take the ones you want. I want these, big ones. I don't know how many I'll need, but I estimated to be more or less a ... Look, kid, listen, if that's really what you want, I will say that these stones have a master, Master Mateo, do you know him? Yes, he has a fig tree, very beautiful. Well, if you want something, go to him with the story, his name is Master Mateo. Hey, boy, what do you want? Where are you going there? You are Master Mateo, mason of the cathedral? If it's him you're looking for, I am. I like your shop, you have many stones. Ah, come on, you like being mason, eh? Mason, what is said stonemason ... What I like are the stones. So! And what are the stones that you like? These so big. And the more the better. And if not, as those I have seen in the quarry. Well, you've been there to see the stones! I've seen a lot, more than I needed to build a convent. Very well, build it. But, without stones ... You'll not tell me to give them to you! Since you say so ... Hey, hey, now I understand all the detours you have taken to reach this, and I'll tell you one thing: if you want stones, go to the quarry and pay for them. But I have no money. Listen, maybe you may give me stones in exchange for something important. No. What if I tell you who robs your figs? I know from two years ago you try to know who is he, I know. And you'll tell me in trade for the stones? Yeah, but ... I wish I had the stones before. Do not you trust me? Not that, it is ... Just in case ... What, you'll give them to me? Agreed. Go to the foreman and tell him to give you all the stones you need for your convent. Truly that ... Yes, go! And if he does not want to give them? He will have to deal with me, and he knows how I get. Listen, then tell me who's the thief. Do not worry, I'll tell you soon. Do not waste time! Hurry! Come! You, stop that!, they must be downloaded from the carts, go! Juan, Bernardo! He said you must give them to me. Hey, you, a moment. Well, you again? Yes, do not bother to download those stones, I just spoke with Master Mateo, and has told you must give them to me. Look, man, we are not wasting time, get out! Come on, hurry up! Well, there you go, but Master Mateo said that if you don't give them to me you will have to do with him, and you know how he gets. I think it would cost you very little to prove whether the boy is lying. And nothing easier than to ask Master Mateo himself. Wait a minute. You think there will be enough? I believe that with a little luck ... Well, at least about to begin. OK, kid, you've come to yours. What? Yes, he said you take them away. Come on, give the order, we are in a hurry. Bring the stones where this guy tells! Come on! Forward! Stop! Is that you were leaving without fulfilling the deal? No, no, I've planned to go now to tell you. No need, my friend, I already guessed that the crook of my figs was you. Download the stones immediately! And you get down there, punk! That's not fair! Now I see why you haven't given me time to tell you, for not giving me the stones. No, it was for you do not take me for a fool. Your idea of the convent seems fine to me, and so you do not say that Master Mateo has no word, the stones are still yours. So what are we waiting? Yes, they're a gift, but remember that nothing we say that you took the carts, only the stones. The sun, pity I can not see it. You know what? I like life, I think that's why I love God so much. It's long yet? We're close. It is strange that Cotolay has not come to me these days, and I want to surprise him. Dimo ... Be careful, Francisco. I ask for the Lord, don't do us any harm. Brother Wolf, I know you had sown terror among the people of these forests, everyone is angry with you, and want to kill you, but if you promise me not to cause any harm I'll mediare between them and you. Tree goes! What's wrong, Cotolay? Hey, boys, here comes Francisco. They are afraid of Dimo, Francisco. Fear not, Dimo has promised me not to harm hereafter, and I have promised him that if he met you will care for his livelihood. Okay, Francisco. Where is Cotolay? There. Hello, Cotolay. You look so sad, what's wrong? Nothing, nothing's wrong. Hey, where did you get the money to buy the land from the monks of St. Martin? From nowhere, only cost me a basket of fish. Come on, Cotolay, I'm your friend, remember the swamp thing. Tell me, where did you get it? I am telling the truth. Do you want me to believe that the Benedictines have not received a single mark in trade for the land? I did not pay them with money. You're lying, Cotolay! I never lie, lying is not of men, and I am! I tell you're lying! The other day, your grandfather and you had a conversation about a treasure, Tell me, where is it? Leave it, Herminio, look no further, the treasure is not there. Perhaps you hold it? We all hold it. What do you mean? Francisco says that the treasure is within us. Do not try to mock me or I swear ...! Where is it? Like I said, within us. Where is it?, I want to see it! Dimo! Francisco, he is here, come quickly! Do not be afraid, Dimo's my friend, come to me, Cotolay. Come on, do not cry, why did you get here? Do not you want to see me? I was embarrassed. I gave you my word that I'll built the convent and I have not done, I can no longer be your friend. In this life, Cotolay, not all things go as we want, God sometimes sends us joys and other sorrows, to test our humility and obedience. Come on, do not weep, lift that face and smile. Come on, smile! That's better. What? We are back to being friends? Yes Good night, Master Mateo! Again here? Why did you come? The fig tree no longer has figs. I want to talk to you. No way. Don't come to me with more requests for stones. Everyone says you have a bad temper, but I do not think so if it were true you wouldn't have done the house of the apostle a porch so pretty. We'll see, we'll see. But what brings you here at this hour? I have to build my convent, and I want you to do it. A convent? You have too much imagination, Cotolay. Go, go, go! Hey, it's true that you take much to finish the porch? Much?, It's been 30 years since I started. They say it's finished, and that you don't uncover it because you're afraid. Fear? Come on! I do not uncover it because... well ... Because it lacks some detail. It is very easy to talk. And when you're done, will you build my monastery? Maybe ... Although maybe I'll be so old I can not even hold the chisel. Too bad, how I would have liked you to build it! Well, I'll think otherwise. Bye! Bye! Wait, there's a storm and you won't get to the huts before dawn, why not stay in my house? If I stay, what will you bring for dinner? Lamb, goat and something else, do you agree? Oh yeah, and if you want I can come back tomorrow too. Cotolay, Cotolay! My porch! You wanted to see the finished porch and you've got, and I'll tell you, you were right, I was afraid, but now, now I will not touch a stone. Then you shall rise my convent! Yes, Cotolay, I will make your convent. Come, come, Martin, come! Once again, Martin, please! I knew we'll won the bet! You're right, man, to gross one no one will win! He may be rough but has won. That you have done is very easy. You think? Maybe you are able to do ... Well, not me... So? But Juan of course is able to do something much harder than that. What makes the Italian? Yes, I have seen, he carries a large load of stones himself. That makes anyone. From the cathedral square to the field in front of San Martin? Where needed, boy. Do not believe it, Martin, it's very heavy for a league and a half. Furthermore, we must rely on the difficulty of dragging the car through the forest. That takes to be a mule! It is that Martin is! Well, what, are you doing it? Like I said, with eyes closed. And me, me too! You can count on me! Well, and what about Juan? Juan is ready when you wish. Agreed. Tarna, you can set the conditions. If you think, who stucks on the road with the load will pay a bottle of wine. Two is better, because we're going to sweat it our thing seeing them pulling carts ... Come on, hurry! Wait, Cotolay, I'm afraid of doing something that is not correct. Now we go with those?, can not believe being as grownup you're such a coward! I am not a coward, Cotolay, is ... Francisco says that the smaller is the boss, the faster we must obey. So holy obedience commands. Well then, what are you waiting? I am small, or am I not? Okay, come on, and may God forgive me. To give us a hand is what is needed from Him. Okay, guys. All ready? That belt! Corageus! My friend, do not forget that I bet on you! Courage! And Juan? Juan, hurry, hurry! Such a bad time you've given us! Come on, Juan! May the Lord reward your efforts, Martin. This time I'll get you so badly that you will not want to come back to face me. I will be well spent for getting involved in these matters. You do not listen, what you have to do is win. We shall see. It's that old grandfather betted his ax with Master Tarna. I've also betted two marks on fellow parent Pedro. On fellow parent Pedro? Well, I also bet on Juan with Antonio, and so I'll win on both sides! And you lose at the same time. Come on, it's true! Off! Come on! Come on! Come on, Juan! Come on, guys! Come on, Juan, but what's wrong? Keep going! Leaving the cars! Everyone at the meadow! Come on, Martin, come on, come on, do not make me a fool! I've bet on you, Martin! Cheer up, Martin! Courage! Go ahead, boys! Come on, already almost there! Bravo, Martin! Vidal, now you've already lost, nobody will pay the wine! Not worth it, that does not count! Vidal! Courage, friend, courage! This is cheating, not fair! Say, why did you let all us pass you by? A minor brother should always be the last. That's not a reason. Well, I'm glad the idea of you winning, because I know you had put in this great endeavor. I never saw a man so foolish as you. I simply follow the advice of Francisco. What, my friends? I confess I have often thought, I'd like to be like one of you. Nothing is easier, why not start helping us build our monastery? What monastery? Which convent you mean? Well, is that all this has been a trick of Cotolay, for you to carry the stones here. Is that true? Cotolay! So all this has been up to you! Well, you know what I mean?, If you want to do a convent, we too! We will make a convent!, a convent as large as the cathedral of Santiago! Francisco ... What is it, Bernardo? We have come for you. Why? Just to have you join us. Francisco is coming!, here comes Francisco! Master Mateo, here comes Francisco! Grandpa, here comes Francisco! Here he comes! Cotolay! Francisco, here's your convent. I'll always have your name engraved on my heart, Cotolay, and I'll never forget that because it was possible to build the first monastery of my order. And thanks to all of you, my friends, the Lord bless you. Hurray Cotolay! Run to our convent, and ring the bell to glory! I'm afraid it will not be possible. Cotolay! ... Let's say goodbye here, Cotolay. Do you remember the day we met? Do not go, Francisco, stay with me! I must follow my path, Cotolay, the Lord wills.
