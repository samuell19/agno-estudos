IN LABRADOR. -DO YOU HAVE A PHOTO? -LET ME DO THE TALKING, OKAY? WHEN I FIRST MET HER, SHE WAS PROBABLY A COUPLE YEARS YOUNGER THAN ME. MAYBE 19. I COULD NEVER GET MY TONGUE AROUND HER NAME IN INUIT, BUT IT MEANT "MIRAGE." SO I CALLED HER MIRA. THERE WERE THINGS BETWEEN US THAT ONLY HAPPEN ONCE IN A LIFETIME. WE'D TRACK UPRIVER SOME DAYS, SNOWSHOE A TRAP LINE. GO FOR HOURS WITHOUT EVER SPEAKING A WORD, AND IT DIDN'T MATTER. WE NEVER MARRIED. BUT BETWEEN SHE AND I, WE ALWAYS FELT WE WERE MAN AND WIFE. -I UNDERSTAND. -WELL, THEN YOU WON'T BE SURPRISED. COME WINTER, SHE WAS PREGNANT. AND THAT WAS FINE WITH US. AND THEN, IN THE SUMMER WHEN IT CAME TIME FOR HER TO HAVE THE BABY... THINGS WENT WRONG. THE BABY DIED. AND THE NEXT DAY... SHE DIED. I LOOKED DOWN AT HER. [SIGHS] AND THEN SHE SAID THE WORDS THAT... SHE HAD TAKEN TO CALLING ME. THEN SHE WAS GONE. QUICK. BEFORE I KNEW IT HAPPENED. IT WAS A BOY BABY, AUSTEN. A BOY. I BURIED THEM TOGETHER. GOT IN A CANOE. CAME BACK DOWN TO VERMONT. FEW MONTHS LATER, I MARRIED YOUR GRANDMOTHER. -AND DOES GRANDMA KNOW ABOUT ALL THIS? -UNTIL NOW, SHE'S THE ONLY OTHER PERSON I'VE EVER TOLD THIS STORY TO. -AND SHE WASN'T MAD? -SHE WAS ANGRY ABOUT EVERYTHING I DID. BEFORE AND AFTER. BUT I CAN TELL YOU ONE THING ABOUT YOUR GRANDMOTHER AND ME. SHE WILL NEVER BE MIRA. AND I'LL NEVER BE THE FELLA THAT SHE WANTED TO SPEND HER LIFE WITH. BUT WE'VE ABIDED EACH OTHER. WE DON'T AGREE ON MUCH, BUT WE'VE LASTED FIFTY YEARS. OH, ONE THING. NOT A WORD TO YOUR FATHER OR THE GIRLS. -OKAY. -OKAY. [GROANS] -GRAMP? GRAMP, WHAT WAS THE NAME THAT MIRA GAVE YOU?

I'LL GIVE YOU A RUN FOR YOUR MONEY. -BETTER RUN FAST, TOO, 'CAUSE I GOT THE KEYS TO YOUR JALOPY. [KEYS JINGLE] [GIGGLES] -EYES IN YOUR BOOK, GIRL. -WE GET THE PICTURE. NOW IT'S TIME TO STUDY OUR LATIN. -I DON'T KNOW MUCH LATIN. NEVER HAD MUCH CALL FOR IT. -MRS. ARMSTRONG DOESN'T KNOW HER LATIN. -BUT SHE'S GOT A MIND FOR DISCIPLINE. YOU'VE GOTTA GIVE HER THAT. -IT'S LIKE A WAR. -FOR ONCE, IT LOOKS LIKE SCHOOL IS UH... PREPARING YOU FOR LIFE. -LIFE OF OPPOSING TYRANNY, I'D SAY. WHICH IS WORTH LEARNING, BUT ONLY IF YOU CAN PREVAIL. WINNING IS ALL, TUT. -WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT, GRAM? -A TEACHER WITH NO LATIN, TUT, IS LIKE A BLIND MAN FLYING AN AIRPLANE. HE MIGHT LAND IT, BUT IT'LL BE DUMB LUCK, AND HE WON'T KNOW HOW IT HAPPENED. FROM NOW ON, I'LL WORK YOU ON YOUR CICERO. AND MR. KITTREDGE CAN, UH, REVEAL WHAT HE KNOWS. -GRAMP KNOWS PLENTY. HE TAUGHT ME ABOUT MAPS, TREES, ANIMALS, GUNS, AND THE HISTORY OF WHISKEY SMUGGLING. -OH, GOD HELP US. I'LL SET YOU STRAIGHT ON SHAKESPEARE, THE BIBLE, HORTICULTURE, AND INSECTS.

WHAT WILL A WOMAN OR MAN DO FOR LOVE? -HE DIDN'T TELL ME THAT. -ASK HIM. -T.S. ELIOT CAN SET YOU STRAIGHT ON YOUR QUANDARY ABOUT TIME. -HOW? -IF ALL TIME IS ETERNALLY PRESENT, ALL TIME IS UNREDEEMABLE. YOU CAN'T GO BACK, BUT TIME PAST IS ALWAYS PRESENT. -SOUNDS LIKE A RIDDLE. -MM.

HERE'S THE LIST. -TEMOVSKY, FAMEUSE, SMOKEHOUSE... I HAVEN'T ENCOUNTERED THESE BEAUTIES IN YEARS. SO, ABIAH, LAYING THE POWER LINES WOULD DESTROY YOUR OLD APPLE TREES? -I WOULDN'T BE HERE OTHERWISE. PLUS, TOO MANY FARMHOUSES IN VERMONT HAVE CAUGHT FIRE FROM BAD WIRING, AND I DON'T INTEND TO BURN TO A CRISP WHILE ASLEEP ON MY BED. NOT TO MENTION THE COST, WHICH WE CAN ILL AFFORD, NOR WOULD I CONDONE THE INVASION OF A TELEVISION SET IN OUR HOME, WHICH WOULD TURN MY GRANDSON INTO A SLUG. -SO, IS THAT THE CASE? AUSTEN, DID YOU INTEND TO UPROOT YOUR WIFE'S APPLE TREES? -I INTEND TO CONDUCT MY DAIRY AND SAW MILL OPERATIONS WITHOUT INTERRUPTION. I'M NOT A RICH MAN, BUT I NEED ELECTRICITY LIKE EVERY OTHER FARM IN THIS COUNTY. -WHAT ABOUT YOUR WIFE'S CLAIM? WOULD YOUR POWER LINES DESTROY YOUR TREES? -I SUSPECT IT WILL. A FEW OF 'EM. WHAT OF IT? THOSE TREES ARE GONE BY. MRS. KITTREDGE KNOWS THAT. GOOD FOR A LITTLE CIDER MAYBE, BUT THAT'S IT! WHY SHOULD HER APPLES BE MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE SAWMILL? -I DIDN'T SAY THEY WERE. OR FOR THAT MATTER, THAT THEY WEREN'T. -ARE YOU GOING TO PERMIT HIM TO DECIMATE MY APPLE ORCHARD AND BURN ME ALIVE? -AUSTEN... I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU AND ABIAH A WRITTEN RULING ON THURSDAY, BUT I WON'T MAKE YOU WAIT. AUSTEN CAN HAVE ELECTRICITY IN HIS SAWMILL AND BARN IF HE LAYS THE ELECTRIC LINES UNDERGROUND, OR IN ANY WAY THAT PRESERVES ABIAH'S ORCHARD AND GARDEN, BUT ONLY IF HE CAN ACCOMPLISH THAT. -BUT WHAT ABOUT MY RASPBERRY BUSHES? THEY'RE, THEY'RE PRETTY MUCH EVERYWHERE. -YOU MAY LOSE A FEW BUSHES, BUT IF HE CAN DO AS I SAY, AUSTEN CAN BRING THE ELECTRICITY IN. -HOW LONG DO YOU PLAN TO GIVE MR. KITTREDGE A BLANK CHECK, AND HOW THE HELL WILL HE PAY FOR IT? -ONCE YOU LAY THE LINES, THE POWER'S THERE. HOW YOU PAY IS FOR YOU AND MR. KITTREDGE TO DETERMINE, BUT I WILL RULE THAT THE JUICE CANNOT BE STRUNG INTO THE HOUSE. -SAYS WHO? -I'VE DECIDED IN YOUR FAVOR, ABIAH.
