Come on! Thank you! Wow! Thank you very much! Wow. Perfect. Thank you so much. Okay, alright, I want to address the elephant in the room Straight off the bat, yes, I am wearing a short skirt on a raised stage. I am fully aware that, decisions were made. I'm committed to it now. So let's, you know... sorry What happens here stays here. I also, I also want to address the fact that I haven't shaved my legs for the performance. And I... yes very brave. I am a hero and I wish I could say that that was like some sort of cool like articulation of my feminism or something like that. It is not that. It is I'm just very lazy. I forgot. But I honestly do think, I have a theory that most... I think most acts of radical feminism were born out of laziness. And do you know what I mean? Yeah, I too would rather burn my bra than wash it by hand. Like fucking Charlie Bucket's mother or some shit. Stirring old bra soup with a wooden spoon. I am not that. So, welcome to the show. Thank you for coming. The show is called Horn Dog, as you can see from the stage. At this point if the show wasn't called Horn Dog I would have some questions, you know what i mean? I am fully that it's an incredibly intense name I think for a show that is actually basically... this show is about love. So if you did come tonight expecting like, you know, like a sexy sex show, So sorry. What you're about to see is an hour of sensitive comedy from a 27 year old Pisces. So, whoa! Raunchy! Want some! And when I said the show about love I don't want to freak you out. That sounds pretty heavy, very deep. It is not a TED Talk, I can promise you that much. It's not one of those fucking comedy shows where it's like, oh, there's a lesson to be learned at the end of it. I hate that kind of shit. It's not the kind of show where it's like Oh, in 2009 I ran over a cat and I learned about empathy. Like it's not... And when I say a cat, I mean biological father. And when I say empathy I mean the patriarchy. It's not that kind of show. It's a show, it's a silly show about love. And it was actually inspired by something that happened to me a couple of years ago, something big that happened to me. And that is that I read this book that changed my life and a huge way. It sounds very cheesy but it's true. And this book essentially it was all about how the meaning of life ends up being the things that you pay attention to the most in your life, right? So the things you love the most, and your entire life ends up being the very meaning of it. And I thought that was an incredible thing to kind of, you know, do a comedy show about. And obviously when I do say I read a book, what I do actually mean there is I listened to a podcast with a review of that book because I am 27 years old. I haven't read a book in four fucking years, okay. Four more years! Four more years! Books suck! Anyway, no? Okay. How can I even read a book when I can't even afford a house to read it in? Don't clap that. I don't even know what that means, right? Anti-boomer humour at the start there. And also when I say I'm doing a show about love, right, I don't necessarily mean romantic love. I don't mean romantic love. I feel like it's a difficult thing to talk about, romantic love, especially when you're a female comedian, I think. Because I think a lot of people when you're a woman, your're a female comedian talking about that they just don't think that you're... They kind of get worried about you a little bit, right, Like I feel like real pity when I talk about anything remotely emotional onstage. It's the exact same form of pity and you guys might know this. It's the same sort of pity I feel as a woman when I eat alone in a restaurant. That is the exact... A few knowing laughs out there. I went, oh, this is true. I went to Palm Springs recently on holiday, alone, because obviously I am doing well financially but not well mentally, okay? Swings in roundabouts, yeah? And I will tell you this, going into a restaurant or asking for a table for one and ordering a steak and martini is a suicide note in any language. So I am not gonna be talking about anything remotely emotional tonight because, I mean, like love it doesn't necessarily just mean romance. It's such a broad concept, right. Like even the word love, it's a word that operates in different ways depending on what context you use it in, right. Like for instance I'll give you an example. So, I could say, for example, I could say that I love spaghetti carbonara. Yes, that is true, thank you for the room, yeah. But it doesn't mean I want to make love to spaghetti carbonara. See the difference? Clearly not. That must be holy shit, wild night. Okay. I'll give you another example of the use of the word love. I could say that I love my cat, yes, that is true. It doesn't mean they want to eat my cat, yeah? See the difference with the use of the word love there? And the weirdest example is that I don't even like the actor Armie Hammer, but I want to fuck him and eat him, yeah. He's so mysterious the way he. So, I knew that I had to focus this show on a very, very specific type of love, a type of love I think I've gravitated towards my entire life And that is that I am a very obsessive person by nature, and that is the approach I take to love. I fucking go hard or go home alright? I have some style, and I often use the word to describe this obsessive kind of love. I use the word horny to describe this type of love. I don't know if anyone else does that. Probably not. Cause it is the wrong use of that word, yeah? But it's the only word I could find in the English language that describes this very specific type of love, this obsessive love that almost feels like it's bursting out of your heart sometimes. It like compels you to do like the wildest, craziest things in your life, right? And it was the only word I could find. And so I was say this to my friend, Jack, about the show, I was like, oh, I've got a show called Horn Dog. Horny's the only word that describes this particular type of love I wanna talk about. It's the best thing on your heart, and you do the wildest craziest things. And he was like, oh, yeah, you mean passion? AAnd I was like, what? And he went, you mean the word of passion? And I was like, yes, I did. So now I've got a show called Horn Dog But I was still struggling to find examples of what I mean by this horny type of love. I feel like we're still not on the same page with this concept. And I didn't find the perfect example until I was back home. I was back in Auckland, New Zealand, where I'm originally from. And... oh, a few of us, fantastic. I was back home. Okay, now I want to take care to say the next bit in the coolest way I possibly can. I was attending a K-pop convention, people. Yes, a few ca fans of K-pop in the crowd. If you don't know what K-pop is fucking sick, it's Korean pop music. It's so good, go on YouTube tonight, treat yourself to it. Fall down that rabbit hole, yeah. But what I saw at this K-pop convention was this dance floor that was set up in the middle of the event space, right, and right next to the dance floor there was this kind of little group of kind of shy, really reserved kind of quiet teenage girls, not talking to each other at all, really meek looking girls. And as soon as the loudspeakers started playing a K-pop song that they recognised, all of them, without speaking to each other, would stand up, get onto the dance floor and then perform these amazingly well rehearsed, meticulously choreographed dance routines to these songs. And when I saw that I was like, this is what I'm fucking talking about, okay? This is horniness right here, okay. This is girls putting a hundred percent into something that is so not worth it, okay? This is what I mean! Yes! And obviously that was what I was feeling in my heart and in my head, clearly what I didn't realise was you're all virgins because... I wanna add on I call it like I see it. Bit of a legend. And, also I have the hindsight of knowing that low self-esteem is actually an asset to a teenage girl, yes? Ooh, that didn't go down well tonight, that's so Would anyone disagree? Is that a crazy thing to say? I'll put it this way, has anyone recently met a teenager with high self-esteem? Has anyone done that? Yeah. Because, yeah, it's fucked up, yeah. It's disgusting, yeah, it's against my beliefs and they're dangers to their communities and they need to be stopped. I will say this right here on this stage, the only two good things, the only two good things we got out of teens with high self-esteem, I'll say it right now, are Malala Yousafzai , okay, and the Lizzie McGuire film, okay? And please don't clap for the Lizzie McGuire film or for Malala Yousafzai. I guess Greta Thunberg, she's pretty good, she's a good yeah, she's a yeah we fa we love Greta, oh yeah, we love Greta. We love calling Greta just Greta' because we're all very scared to say her last name. And so love Greta Thunberg, yeah.. I love her, she's awesome. She's obviously so great. What I will say ... is... it's very quiet at this point in show Nothing bad. I honest. I love her, obviously. What I will say is that, and I might sound old-fashioned. But in my day we called a nerd a nerd We called a nerd a nerd, and it's fine. You're a fucking little nerd, okay? And that's okay. You can be a nerd. Greta is amazing, but she strikes me as the type of teenager who knows a lot about wine, you know. That's that teenager, you know, she like brings like a natural wine to pre drinks and you're like, hmm, thanks Greta, put it on the communal table, this. Pretty cool, right? I just fundamentally think that teenagers should not have personalities, is that crazy? I just don't think you should have you can have interests, that's fine. I loved Garfield as a kid, right? I honestly think it's just a red flag when parents introduce their children with like a very strong personality identifier, like a mum's like, this is Caitlyn. Caitlyn, she's eight years old, she's very outspoken. She's very outspoken. And she says that because you're not allowed to call your own daughter a cunt, ou know what I mean? You're not allowed. It's not okay to use words, you can have outspoken, you know. But I just think children should be basic, that's what they should be. I was basic. I was basic as fuck as a teenager. I was a little basic bitch. I was proud of it little BB, little BB. Little BB queen. Little BB king. Right, now, Now, what that was, was me trying to appeal to two very different sides of the crowd there and somehow missing both alright? I was basic, though, and that's fine, I mean, I it wasn't like What's so weird is I feel like there was an obsession with girls not being basic with girls trying to figure out, young girls trying to figure out who they were at a really, really early age. And my parents they tried desperately to imbue me with a sense of personality as a child. And I knew this because my mother, in the early 2000s she almost exclusively only dressed me in sassy slogan t-shirts, right. That is all she dressed me in, and what I think she forgot and I think a lot of the designers of those shirts forgot as well, is that sometimes, sometimes, a nine-year-old child does not have the confidence or the knowledge to sort of back some of those slogans up, right? Most of them I didn't know what the fuck they meant. I had one, very simple, very elegant, one word. Glittery fog. One word, it just said, fragile'. What does it mean? 'Fragile'. I had another one, I had another one, it was very confrontational. It said another one said, Don't bug me!' Don't bug me, man. Yeah. But, guys, the crazy thing about this one, right, was that instead of the word bug' they put a picture of a bug, right? But they fucked up because the bug they chose out of any bug you could choose, was a bee. So, every day I had nine-year-old boys coming up to me and being like Don't be you, who the fuck would wanna be you, piece of shit? And I was like, fair enough, fair enough. Says it on the t-shirt, right? I had one I had another one that my auntie got me, it was very ahead of its time, it said, um, uh, Girls are human too'. And this was incredible and so ahead of its time I think because this was the early 2000s. It was years and years before Taylor Swift had invented feminism, you know what I mean? It was really ahead of its time. I still think that there's something that we I've grown up, I still think I kind of withered, though, I feel like we're sold all these fucking bullshit slogans that mean nothing. I feel like there's a there's a sense of self-esteem that I want to I want to see if you guys know what I'm talking about here. It's a type of self-esteem I have started calling adult white girl self-esteem, okay? An inaudible hush has descended upon the audience there I feel like that's really my target demo, uh. Also, I think people get really itchy when I say that sort of stuff. I've got to remind you I am half white so I'm allowed to say those sort of things, yeah But I'm also half brown as well, so I can laugh at you And it's a gorgeous privilege there. And what I'm talking about, okay, I'll explain myself adult white girl self-esteem is the type of self-esteem and self-belief that I felt I feel like is is it's a commodified sense, a commercialised sense of self-esteem and self-belief largely sold to adult white women, sometimes appropriating other cultures along the way. That's all I'm talking about when I talk about adult white girls self-esteem, okay? And I will move on cause this bit is not going well I feel like I'm not I feel like I always need to defend this bit. Okay, what I'll say is, And before I say the next bit I want to remind you that I say it with nothing but love and light in my heart. So, if this applies to you, do not take this personally. But what I mean by this is that for instance if you were over the age of twenty-five years old and you are still buying notebooks from Primeart, yeah, that say shit on the front of them like, 'I woke up like this' like hashtag flawless, right, I think what you actually might be is inherently full of flaws, yeah. Do you know what I'm talking about here? These like fucking faux feminist slogans that we're sold like they don't even mean anything, they're just words next to each other at this point and just be like, my other unicorn's a feminist, like what does it mean?! Self-care on , like what? What are you saying? What are you actually saying? I just wanna know, and I promise I will move on. But I will say this, who looks at a fucking pencil case that says you're amazeballs' on it at a time of need and is genuinely like, I really needed that today. Get help, seek professional help instead. I always feel so mean saying that. And I don't mean you can have as much self-esteem as you want but I just I think there's a limit, I think there's a limit, honestly, And I think I've hit the limit, I found the perfect level of self-esteem and that is that as an adult woman, and I think some of you might possess this confidence yourself. I truly have the belief in myself, I truly believe that sometimes I can measure a length between the two tips of my index fingers and then travel with that measurement to the other side of a room and believe that it will be at all accurate there? That's all confidence you ever need, right? So, um, where was I? Okay, I was at this K-pop convention, right? I was at the K-pop convention obviously being hauled away by security because of my comments to these children, yeah, and as I was, I was like, Rose, that is so fucking rich of you to be yelling that kind of shit out to those girls because when you were their age you were exactly the same as them, right? You were always putting a hundred percent into things that were totally not worth it. And also you were as much of a fucking little virgin as any one of those girls on that dance floor, right, because I did not realise to the extent of which I was truly, truly a virgin, right, spiritually and physically, right. I didn't realise this until very, very recently and that was very recently when I became obsessed, and I think a lot of people in this country did as well. I got obsessed with Love Island. Any fans? Yes? Fans in the crowd? I love it, it, I'm fucking obsessed. I want to go on it. I want to go on it. Ooh, and thank you for your support there. That was absolutely damning there, fuck you. I think I'd be amazing on Love Island, I honestly, I would be so good. But for me, just like ideally like a few little tweaks to the format just to like suit my personality. So, okay, alright, hear me out, I will. Okay, so instead of like a villa in Spain, like they all go to like South Africa or whatever, we get to go to like a very old mansion in the countryside. And then instead of wearing like misguided like crop tops and like all the crop tops and like, you know, little bikinis, we get to wear like full sweaters to cover the mic packs, and instead of going there to find love, we're all there to solve we're all there to solve a murder. And saying it out loud now, I do think I'm just describing Cluedo there. I just wanna buy Cluedo, this is a side note, and I will I will just briefly mention this, I could always tell as a teenager which one of my friends was the most sexually active by which one of them chose Miss Scarlet as their character, it'd be like Cluedo, so every time a friend would choose her, I'd I'd be like, the girl's touched a dick, like Man respect, man respect. And I'd be like, Mrs White for me then I've never touched a dick myself out of that. But so we got obsessed with Love Island in our household and what we did was we figured out our love statistics of our life time. So, I figured out people, I figured out from the beginning all the way from zero, all the way to the end. Now, I had kissed nine people in my entire life and I thought that was actually an entirely average amount until I asked one other person, okay, turns out that's pretty fucking low, right, especially considering the fact that I had literally never rejected anyone in my life, right,, ever. I run a very open home policy when it comes to that sort of stuff. Come on in, choose one, choose all, it's all fine, it's fine. And it's crazy, I kissed nine men in my life, right, and I honestly think that subconsciously there I am holding out at single digits with men because I think once I hit double digits it does mean that I am definitely straight and I am not ready for that. Not my future, not my president, yeah, that's a horrible thing to sign up for, right, because it's the worst of all of them. If that makes sense, right? It's the worst sexuality gender combination. I know it's very un-PC to rank them, right? But it is at the bottom, it's, it's worse than being a straight man if you actually think about it, right? Yeah, I said it. But what it means is that given all of the options in the world for any sexual partner we desire, we still went with fucking dudes, like what is going through my mind? What kind of poor decision-making skills does that reflect upon our community, especially at a time like this? Holy shit! Tough time to be a straight woman, I'll say that much Oh my God. So, I've got a lot of straight male friends, yeah, because I am an ally. And they say, they're like, Rose, it's a tough time to be a decent man. Yeah, do you know, yeah, you know what's a little bit harder, is trying to be a straight woman at a time like this given what we know about you now, okay,. And the only accurate way I've come to describing what that truly feels like, to be a straight woman at times like these, is it almost feels like trying to recommend a restaurant that has given you food poisoning eight times, okay That's truly what it feels like, you tell your friends to go, you're like, no, no, no just go, just go, don't go online, don't read the reviews, don't read that, Don't go on Yelp, that's fine, that's fine, not all restaurants, yeah, not all restaurants, yeah? They're good, they're really good, trust me. And I but I still love men, I love to kiss them, I I do, and I don't even think it's... I don't even think it's necessarily the fact that I like men, I think it's the type of men I traditionally go for. An it's a very specific type, I don't know if you ha yeah, I think you have them in the UK, we definitely have them in New Zealand, total fucking nightmares. Do you have that strain up here as well? And it's my type on paper, my T on P, I go towards that And, I don't know, I'm just so easily forgiving of men, and also on the flip side, I'm so easily impressed by men as well, that is my problem. Oh my God, if a man can show a moderate level of skill in literally anything, fucking sign me up, honest to God. I feel like a man if I see like a man leaf-blowing, if the man like knows like the right oil that has like a low smoke point to cook a steak, what, what... If a man can fold a fitted bedsheet bellissimo, yeah. I genuinely think that men with this shit together could be quite a popular porn category. That would be insane. I met a guy the other day who could drive a boat. I'm sorry, what? What the fuck are you talking about? That is the coolest thing ever. It was like, I tell you what, his name was Calum, let's call Calum But his name might not be Calum. And he shit. Shit. And he was I don't want to say ugly, that's a very, that's a very that's a very strong word. It's hard to describe what he looked like. Do you know that do you know that bit in an apricot that goes in? Do you know that little bit, that little divot, that little? That times two were his eye sockets, okay. Little wrap-around pair of Dirty Dogs covering that shit up. His face was symmetrical but in a bad way, yeah. So, he wasn't like my type but by the end of that hour long boat ride I wanted to fuck Calum, okay. Because if he can drive one it's the sexiest thing I could ima Can anyone drive a boat in the crowd tonight? Okay. Classy. That's fucking bullshit cause there's like three hundred people in here. I'm waiting for the day where I ask that and I just see like a captain in the crowd slowly take off his own hat , put it under his seat. I want no part of this, you dirty girl. He'd be right to. I'd be after him, right, because if you can drive a boat I don't care what you look like, I don't care who you are. You can have kidnapped me, you could have kidnapped me and you're driving me to the middle of a lake to dump my body if you're driving the boat I'm still gonna get some vibes going. You know what I mean? Like I'd be like, so, do you own the boat or is it like a shared thing with friends or...? I love it, love these cushions, vinyl, wipe down easy, that's great, that's great. That's what you do. Do you have a Bluetooth speaker or? It's horrible, like I'm a flu I'm a floos. No one said that word for twenty years. But it's the most accurate description, I'm such a floos. I've got such an obsessive energy when it comes to guys I think. And I don't know where it comes from. But I can pinpoint when these feelings started I think, and I feel like all these obsessive feelings about guys and even just obsessive feelings in general I can pinpoint those started around the ages of like ten or eleven for me. And I was writing the show, obviously the penny dropped, obviously that coincides with another huge moment in my life, which was for me the beginning of puberty, right. So obviously there was a connection between these obsessive feelings and, you know starting that journey of discovering one's sexuality, right? So, I want to do this thing. I think you guys will be up for it, I want to take us back in time. I want to take us on a little time travel trip, if that is okay with you guys? I'm gonna take you back to the ancient year of 2005, okay. We've got a few visual aids here for you. And also we've got some audio kind of, to kind of key you back into 2005, alright? 2005, are we there? Are we there? Alright. 2005, the OC makes its broadcast premiere on New Zealand television the very same year I get my first period, coincidence? Hell no! I got my first period at a school camp, of all places, I remember my friend Sophie Smith was standing outside the toilet cubicle when it happened, I started crying and she started laughing because she thought I was doing a hilarious gag. So, not only a big day for me where I became a woman, but also a crack-up entertainer. Uh, first gag, right. And it was such an interesting time to kind of start this journey because 2005 it was the era of which I can only accurately describe to you guys as the era of the early 2000s Internet. Does anyone remember the early 2000s Internet? Yes, a murmur of recognition there. Oh my God, do you remember it was fucking crazy, okay It was entirely unsupervised, wasn't it? Our parents didn't know what the fuck we were up to on the internet. It was like the wild, wild west out there We could do whatever the fuck we wanted to as long as our parents didn't need to use the phone, it was okay then. It was nuts. I thought it was a mad shit, I invented the dark web. I invented the dark web, That was me, it was an accident, I started a guild on Neopets and then everybody just kept joining. I was like, oh, this is the dark web now, that's And when I was a teenager, I think deeper into the 2000s it was an even more specific, period of time where I think technologically two generations were very much overlapping each other. So, for a brief moment in the 2000s, I don't know if anyone remembers this there was one year where we all owned mobile phones, yeah. But we all still owned digital cameras as well. Do you remember that one year? I was all over that shit as well, I was all over it. Kercha! Yes! So, that was me. I was, a horny teenager with access to the early unsupervised Internet The world was my oyster. The only problem was that boys did not like me. I really had to sing that to get the pain of the statement, right. And, it's true, boys just did not like me. I was into I was very unpopular with boys. I think it was because of a number of reasons. I had curly hair, I had curly hair as a teenager, still do But it was a problem because I think at the time in the 2000s like sleek really straight hair was kind of the fashion, and it really it kind of makes me happy because I think now curly hair is having a real resurgence. Everyone's very positive about curly hair, it's fantastic. Yeah, it's fantastic. But okay, that might come from someone who has curly hair themselves, right? I wanna know, I still feel like, as a curly-haired person in this era, I feel like there's an air of condescension behind some of the compliments you get for your curly hair. There always is, because it always comes from someone who does not possess curly hair themselves, okay. So it'd always be like a middle-aged woman who's like, Rose, oh, my God, I lo I love your curls, I love your curls. Ooh, they look gorgeous and you know what you are so brave, you are so brave. It takes guts to do what you do. Yeah, and I'm like, it takes guts to do what? And they're like, you know, argh! Argh, be ugly. Uh, you go, you go, girlfriend. And I think it was the curly hair, it was also like as a teenager I so I had flat feet as a teenager, it was that, it was that and nothing to do with my personality, okay. I have genetically flat feet as well, I don't know if anyone else has that. It's horrible. I've had that since birth. But that wasn't something my parents cared to fill me in on, right? I had to find out that I have completely flat feet at school, getting out of the school swimming pool, walking to the girls changing rooms and just hearing one girls scream whose footprints are those?! So that was chill, that was chill as hell, right. What? I will say this, I had a really, as a teenager I had a really bad case of resting bitchface as a teenage girl, and I wasn't even using that term as an adult because obviously it's a horrible term because it's inherently gendered, right, people only describe women as having resting bitchface because people only describe women as being bitches. Nobody describes a man as being a bitch no matter how hard I try to get that off the ground, okay Call a man a bitch tonight alright, start some shit. But it's rooted in this fucked up expectation that women should always be smiling and laughing and looking approachable to men. But for men, the exact opposite is true because resting bitchface, that's your default face, fellas. I hate to tell you, right. But and I hate the double standard of that, but part of me, honestly part of me deep down is kind of okay with it because I do prefer it to the alternative because I think we can all agree that there is nothing more terrifying than a man who is constantly smiling, okay, fellas. Far more disconcerting. When I see a man who's always smiling I get the same feeling in the pit of my stomach I feel when I see a dolphin smile, I don't know if anyone else has seen one. Has anyone seen a dolphin smile recently? It's fucking terrifying, okay. I don't trust anything where you can see all of its teeth at the same time when it smiles, right, it's horrible. It's I mean, that took four hours to edit, worth it? No. Sweet, that's what I thought it was, the curly hair and the flat feet and the resting bitchface, that meant that didn't have a boyfriend as a teenager. That was until my friends from school came and saw this show and they were like, Rose, I don't know if it was like the curly hair or the flat feet, I think it was the fact that you brought a leather briefcase to school every day for four years. And I was like, I don't see the connection there, like I had one ace up my sleeve though, with boys, impressing boys as a teenage girl and that was when I was a big movie fan, I was a big film nerd as a teenage girl and I'll tell you this for free, what is so true is that teenage boys are fucking thick as shit, right. And they are so easily impressed by any teenage girl who knows literally anything about any film ever made, or like any like album ever created, because they're, they're dumbasses and they almost think that you grew up in like an alternate universe where you didn't ingest all the same fucking pop culture that they did, like as a teenage girl. So I'd always have the same boys all the time, they'd always come up to me and be like, wait, wait, Rose, are you are you telling me you've Memento? Did you get it? Did you get it, though? Did you get it? And the problem is it was the only attention I ever got from boys I fucking lapped that shit up. I'd be like, yeah, I have, I guess I'm not like other girls. Just so bad, right. That is a real tip to any young girls out there, always say that youre not like other girls, because other girls are pieces of shit, and it's healthy to foster a sense of distrust within your community, okay. A Cosmo tip for you there. The raunchiest thing I ever got literally online, I will tell you this, is, this is entirely true, when I was fourteen years old, I got kicked off a friend's Ferdinand message board Do you remember Franz Ferdinand? Yes? Okay. I got kicked a friend's Ferdinand message board because in the forum I posted a post saying that I wanted to marry the lead singer, Alex Kapranos, and the moderator kicked me off because he said it was inappropriate talk for the forum. Oooh! Oh, how I wish I could show that moderator what the Internet has become. I can watch porn in a library , and I do! No, that's a joke, the wi-fi's very weak. Uh and I that's actually something I wish, so as a teenager I actually never watched porn, like right, I never touched the stuff. You'd think that would be the first thing horny teenager with access to the Internet would run towards, but I never did, and part of me regrets that in a way because I feel like... I feel like if I had I think I would have had a chance of like, like maybe like masturbating at an earlier age, right. And that's it's always, all hap it's all coming out now, that's But what I mean is that I so I didn't masturbate till I was eighteen years old Yeah, you're right to gasp, but. Eightee eighteen! Eighteen years old! Legal age. Legal age, yeah. I respect myself. Eighteen. The closest thing I ever got to it was a fucking accident, okay. That sounds more sinister than the story. It was an accident, and I remember it so clearly because it was when I was thirteen years old. I was walking into my bedroom and I wasn't looking where I was going. And I bumped into a set of drawers that were at exact crotch height. And I remember bumping into them softly, walking away. And just being like, why did that feel so fucking good, right? I did a spin, I think I think I'm gonna sha moan as well, it was crazy. But it's like as a kid I didn't understand what the connection was between those feelings and what had happened, right, because I think I think teenage girls in my generation or maybe where I grew up we were never explicitly taught how to masturbate, or even encouraged how to ma like, you know, to masturbate or to explore that, right. Like that was a big word to get around it, I think there was always vague words like just explore, just explore, just explore, girls. Just it's fucking vague, isn't it? Just explore your bodies, girls, just explore, explore your bodies, like, you know with old lantern, you know, like with an old stick and a hat, Yeah. You're in the unknown, right? I've been exploring this cavernous pussy for twenty years Still haven't found my own clitoris. Marco? And also when it comes to that stuff, I don't I'm so bad at it. I am so bad at it. I do I like I, this is tec I know what to do technically, yes, don't give me that, right. I technically know what to do, but my problem is that I get so easily distracted when I'm on my way to doing it, that is my main problem. I'll just be like, so like yes, let's do it, tonight's the night, whoa. It's on. I'm not saying anything, if you wanna Look in the mirror, it's gonna happen, alright. And I'll be on my way to doing it, and then suddenly just like a random thought will just pop into my head, so I'll be re I'll be there, ready, about to do it and then suddenly I'll just be like what ever happened to Keane? Remember Keane? Then I'll start googling Keane, right. Then I'll start seeing when their summer tour dates are and shit. Then I'll try and go back to having a wank. Do you know how hard it is to have a wank when you're still thinking about Keane? It's incredibly hard. Also, I know that's not how you do it. Just a light tap, yeah, light tap over denim, you know, no, I'm done. That's good for me, right. A light tap over denim. So, I guess what I'm trying to say is that I think there is just a fundamental difference when it came to horniness as a teenage girl compared to being a teenage boy, right? I just think it was just inherently different, I think if you happen to have a thing, yeah, and it's there and it is jutting out and is and you do stuff to it and the stuff escapes I have had sex before, I do wanna just reiterate that. But that is a more straightforward solve to feelings of horniness, right. But I feel like with girls sometimes it's like a lot more complicated. It's like emotionally complex horniness, right. Like, like for instance when I was a teenage girl and I had a crush on a teenage boy I didn't imagine what his dick looked like. I made a fucking collage, you know what I mean, like okay, what are these feelings, right? Okay, so I got to the age of eighteen years old and I finally achieved what I think I'd been yearning for all throughout my teenage years was that I finally got a boyfriend, yes, ooh, yes, urgh. Thanks, oh, do not whoop just yet, okay. Cause what that started, unbeknownst to me, was this almost this domino effect of back-to-back long-term relationships with not many gaps in between, between the ages of eighteen to twenty-five. I told you I fucking go hard or I go home, yeah. Another true thing about me is that out of the last five people I have kissed, I have then entered relationships with four of those people cause I am not smart. And that's what I do, I just throw myself head first into these situations into relationships, and my friends they think they know me better than me. They're like, Rose, you know what your problem is, what your problem is, is that you're scared of being alone, it's cause you're scared of being alone. And what's very interesting is that it's actually not that. What it actually is, is it's actually something different that I can't quite pinpoint right now. But there is something there, and maybe I'll explore that another day in another show, but it is actually quite personal, so don't stop asking questions about it. That's obviously a joke. I am obviously self-aware enough to know, you know what it is. But sometimes it's hard to put into examples that are quite relatable to people. So I will, I'll give it a go, what I'm trying to I guess what I'm trying to say is, do you know that feeling when you love someone so much, but you know that you can't be with that person but you know that that love for that person can't just disappear it can't just like evaporate from your body. It has to exist within your body for the rest of your life, almost like in a crystallized form at the bottom of your stomach, it's almost like You put a Horcrux in that person and that person's put a Horcrux in you, and you live the rest of your life knowing that you're gonna love that person in a really deep, important way, unlike anyone else you'll ever love in your life, but will just live inside you for the rest your life and never go away. Do you know what I'm? Is that relatable? I did try and turn that into a meme, but that didn't really imply that's is that not relatable? We are selling our t-shirts and tote bags as well, so I don't is that am I gonna lose money on that? Is that not relatable? Okay. That's fine. I think maybe this, okay, maybe this isn't relatable, but I think this is what it is for me, and it might relate to someone but I think that what my thing is, is that I'm more I am more in love with the idea of being in love more than the reality of it. That is it. I am more in love with the concept of being in love, rather than the reality of it. It's the same approach I take to baths. And you know what I mean by that, like the idea of a bath it's fucking incredible. But the reality of a bath is that you are hot and you're wet and you're alone with your thoughts, okay. And that is literal hell to me, right. I go into a set of negative meditation when I get to a a therapist is like that just sounds like mild depression. And I was like potato, potato. Same deal. All about MD, a little house MD. Mild depresso. I go to my therapist a lot and it's so funny cause most of the things I talk to her about are usually about relationships cause I think that's what stems most of my anxieties and stuff. And she says the same thing to me every time, every single time. She's like, Rose, Ro, what your pro what your problem is, is that you're obsessed with things that have happened in the past and things that might happen in the future. But you're never just in the moment. That's you're never just living in the moment. So, all you've gotta do, all you've gotta do, all you've gotta do is you've gotta do you live in the moment, you've gotta live in the moment, Rose. And every time I hear that I'm like, that's incredible advice, thank you so much for that. What sage, wise advise. And then another part of me, very deep down, thinks, how am I paying you sixty fucking British pounds to tell me something I could buy on the front of a fucking notebook from Prime Art? Fucking live in the moment, girl. Like what? So what, man? You don't need to clap, you don't need to clap. But it's true you're a fucking medical professional. What the fuck is wrong with you? And she's like so wrong about so many things. She also said, after last long-term relationship I got out of all of the feelings of like euphoria and all these happy feelings I was describing to her she would actually technically describe that as mania and I was like, I don't know what you're talking about, I feel amazing! So, I got rid of her. Cause she just didn't she wasn't on my wavelength, but she was right about one thing, and I will give her this, and that she I do, I do obsess over things that haven't necessarily happened yet, I do obsess about scenarios that haven't happened yet because I like to prepare for the worst, right. And I do have this recurring fantasy about, it's like an awesome scenario to like workshop if anyone is interested. It's the scenario of me finding out that my ex-boyfriend is seeing someone new. That is like it's delicious, you should try it. It's because I wa I practice it because when that happens, I want to be fucking glamorous as hell when it happens , right. I want to be like Katharine Hepburn when that bombshell drops, and I've thought about it to like the smallest detail. Like it's crazy. Like ideally, I'll show you, I'll just show you. Ideally when it happens, I'll be holding something, right. Like I'll be like doing the dishes or doing like a little bit... like ittle bit of chores or something. And so, as soon as the person, like my friend tells me that my ex-boyfriend is seeing someone new, this is exactly how I'll react. I have practiced this, okay. Eliza? What a lovely name. I must send a telegram. You know what I mean? It's just It's just don't clap that, don't. Don't clap it because it's actually not okay, right. You're enablers if you clap, right, that's cause that's not normal behaviour and it never happens. You can't plan how that's gonna happen. It always happens in the worst possible situation. It always happens on your fucking on a bus on the way to West London. You're about to get your hair cut and you cry all the way through the haircut and you have to pretend you're allergic to a hairdryer, okay. That's how it happens. Is that example too specific? And my friends tell me, they're like, Rose, Ro, you are twenty-seven years old, you have to have the emotional maturity to let someone move on with their life. And I say, sorry, sorry, are you you are talking to a woman who has no fewer than three full pint glasses of old water on her nightstand at any given moment, you think I possess the maturity to let someone move on with their lives? And especially at a time like this, at a time like this where I think if the Internet was something that actively helped us as teenagers like discover our sexualities and all that, it's something that actively like hinders us as adults to get over someone, to like fall out of love with someone. Like if it I am I'm fine by the way, you're really crazy. But has anyone, I'll ask this, has anyone in the room had to go through a breakup in the age of Facebook memories? Why would you wanna do that? Because I I I'll tell you this much, when you're going through a break-up, Facebook memories is essentially an abusive friendship, yeah , cause it's the equivalent of someone coming over to your house and being like, hey, here you go, is that oh my God, I made you a photo album of you and your boyfriend's trip to America three years ago. Why are you crying? Are you okay, girl? Are you Oh my oh, you broke up years ago? Oh, how could I not know that since I had access to almost all of your personal information? In fact, fuck you, Facebook, I don't see how they can't figure that out. I don't see how Facebook can read into my messages and see when I might be freaking out to my friends that I might be pregnant and then target Clear Blue pregnancy tests to me the next hour. But they can't figure out I fucking broke up with someone years ago. I just wanna say, where is the algorithm for that? And its anything, it's ev so every time, it's everything, it's everything, all my apps, all my apps got a clue, clue. My period I've got a period tracking app, has anyone, uh, got a period tracking app? Anyone? Yes? Yes, oh, fuck it, everyone should have a period tracking app, it's great. Use it as a calendar, I don't know, very sad advent calendar, right. I love my period tracking app, but I have two problems with it and the first problem is, and I will say it, I say this with love but sometimes when I'm updating my period tracking app, I almost feel like I'm writing some sort of entry into a wartime journal. Because you know what the language you have to use with it? You'd just be like, day five. Still bleeding. I miss my wife so much, right. That's what it feels like, but the second problem I have and this is true, this has been proven, your period tracking app is selling information to your Instagram account. So at the height of my menstrual cycle every month, I am advertised the same fucking pair of dungarees I could never pull off, like what is it that stirs that? That is someone preying on me at my most emotionally vulnerable and it's everything's bovine! You know it's bovine when it feels like, oh, it's like the top songs of like a certain year, so be like, oh, top songs of 2016 or whatever, and then all those songs, they remind you of ex-boyfriends, so you have to rename the playlists to something like crying', but then you realise that your profile is public, so all your friends can see it, so you have to rename it to something more inconspicuous like summer anthems'. Put palm trees on the side. Netflix! Oh my God, do you know when you like log into Netflix and you're like, your ex-boyfriend is still logged into it so you're like, I'll have a look at what he's watching. And so you go in and you see that he's half way through the new series of Stranger Things and you're like, oh, that's so weird because that was sort of our thing. And so what you do is you watch you six episodes in one night so you can catch up where he is so you can like watch at the same time as him, at the same pace, even though he's not talking to you. So you feel like you're sharing That's too specific. Well, that's the show, um So I think are there any there aren't any more slides are there? Are there any more slides? Sorry, I'm here. Yeah. Thank you for coming, um, usually that bit like, is like an ending where everyone's like, oh, you're like great, it's so relatable, and like and then we like end on like a high, but no, that's, yeah, cool. So, it's like an it's like anticlimactic, so I guess oh, I guess if there were a lesson to be learned and there really is a new word is that maybe sometimes you put a hundred percent into something and it doesn't work out, it doesn't work out. But that doesn't mean it wasn't worth it, that's not what I mean. Like I don't want that to be the message of the show, like maybe I was, maybe was wrong at the start of the I think maybe I was wrong in the sense that I feel like it's not actually what it's not actually what you love, it's actually how you love, you know, it's like actually what kind of person you are and how you express that love. And you can't that's like that's what has meaning to it. And I feel like you can't you can't change that, you can't change your personality. You can't change the fact that you're twenty-seven years old, you're So why would you want it? Why would you want it? Why would you want it? I'm fine. Why would you want to hold back, though, from one of those things that you feel like is one of the most awesome parts of your personality, cause you throw yourself fully into something, because like why would you hold back from doing that at a time like thi we're gonna we're gonna fu we are gonna fucking die in two years. Do you know what I mean? Like I heard that on a podcast, right, so, I know why would you hold back from loving someone with all of your heart? Cause I think like love is like a high-risk, high-reward situation, isn't it? And the more you put in, the more you stand to get out, you have to risk something. And even if you're going through the most awful, like horrible form of heartbreak at any point in time all that means is that at some point you had the most incredible, like amazing form of love as well, and surely there's meaning in that. And I just think that putting a hundred percent into something will always be worth it. Oh my God! Thank you! Thanks guys.
