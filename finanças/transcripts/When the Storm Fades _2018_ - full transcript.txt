Super Typhoon Haiyan raced across the Philippine Islands, kicking waves up to 19-feet high. Whole towns looking like they've been washed away. Thousands of people have been killed. Climate change, without a doubt, is warming up the oceans and oceans are where big storms get their energy from. We're looking at the aftermath of one of the strongest storms to ever tear across the ocean and smash into land. The economic cost of this storm will approach $15 billion. It is very, very difficult conditions for the people here on the ground, and it's not clear how much longer it can continue like this. Something has gotta give. Get international help to come here now. Not tomorrow, now. Hi. Hi. Ah, okay. Manumi. I'm gonna get these as well. Forty per kilo. Okay, 40 per kilo. Sounds good. Papaya. - No, no, no. - What? This one is... - What is this? - Papaya. Papaya. Okay. That's all, thank you. We've just taken off the bottoms, I think. Uh, you'll just get one - so that the roots will come out. - Oh, okay. - Put it in this one? - This one. One, two, three. - Okay, maybe let's... - Ah. It's full... Your memory's full. What? I can't take any more pictures. I thought I wiped it. No, can I delete some stuff? Well, yeah, but what is it? Okay. Um... There's some stuff in the room, just kind of the shoes. No, not the shoes 'cause that's a funny shot. - Okay. - Of all the shoes 'cause they're so dirty. Right. Okay. Can I go back further then, or... Sure, yeah, go back further. You can go back to... - Go back to before we came. - Okay. Yeah, it's got pictures of the dinner that you made for me before we left. How many of those are there? There's, like... I feel, like, there's 30 of those. Okay, let's delete two. You get the flash off? Yeah, I don't have the flash on. You got it on HD? - HDR, yeah, yeah. - Okay. So when you come, you stop, bend down, and keep your eye on... on the... on the rim, and then you just go for it, okay? That's the physical part. The mental part is you just gotta believe in yourself. Or else, it's like, why'd you even show up, right? So check this out, do it exactly like I do it. Here, that's how it's done. That was close. I mean, I usually get it on the first try, but... Going for it. Yeah, that was... That was good. I mean, it was a little bit of a sloppy start but you got the goal, so why does it matter? We see the world the same way, and that's why. I think we are... found each other and work together. Yeah, because, I mean, obviously we're... Thank you. Perceptions, like, opened up and we can like see more. - Yeah. - But, um... But we have the... - We have the money to come and do that. - Yeah. So it's like you're buying... Buying yourself... - Did that kid just throw a rock at a dog? - Yeah. That's fine. That's, like, what it's like here. How long will they take to get that big? Uh... That, uh, mangrove, uh, 2013, we, uh, planted that. You feeling lunch soon? Anyone feeling lunch? The other one we plant in January. - This January, 2016. - I can wait. And they grow up fast. I didn't have much for breakfast but that's okay. You know, it's what the world wants for us not to nap. You know, first to work hard and then go to another job and work hard at that, and then go and deal with family at home, which is like work. And then never have time to nap and then, you know, you don't feel like yourself when you wake up from a nap. You get to when you're 60, you don't feel like yourself. I think animals do it right. Like cats. Cats are just laying around. Wake 'em up with a noise, they wake up for a second. Then they go back to bed. Yeah, you're like a cat. I'm like a cat. I'll watch you. Well, if you wanna join me, you're more than welcome. But, uh, they wanted us all to wear really short skirts, like, lot of leg, and, uh, I didn't want to do that... ...uh, so I quit that, um... And then I was working for a while as a receptionist at an acupuncturist. - What is that? - Um... Like, acupuncture is like, uh... people come in and they... they stick needles... - Oh, okay. - ...in their bodies. Yeah, and it feels, like, good. Like, people want to do that. But I just feel like it wasn't really challenging, so I would, like, fall asleep at my desk, and no one cared. So, um... So I guess I don't know. I'm, uh... kind of trying to figure it out. - You're still finding what you want. - Yeah. Yeah, still trying to find it. But I guess whatever it is, I hope that it's, like, spiritually fulfilling, like, feels good. Yes, I don't know, maybe work with kids or something, I don't know. But, um... Do you know what you wanna do? - Yeah, I want to become a chef. - Yeah? - A chef? Amazing. - Yeah. - Are you in school for that? - Yeah. I'm in, uh, Atrium. It's a hotel restaurant management. Oh, okay. So what do you... What do they teach? Baking, uh, bartending, housekeeping, um, cooking. - Wow. - Yes. And in my fourth year, my last year in college, um, we go to Singapore for the on-the-job training for three to six months. But I don't know yet if I can go there 'cause we don't have enough money. But my mama and my papa is keeping the money for me to go there. Great. Wow! Well, sounds like you have it all figured out. I don't know what I wanna do so you're better than me with that. Thank you. - Cheers, guys. - Cheers. How many different groups are around there? Two hundred or so in Tacloban even, is it? - Here in Tacloban? - Yeah. Seven to eight, probably. Every one. Every major one you've ever heard about. - Yeah. - And, um, - a couple of hundred of them... - UN, UNICEF, Save the Children, the Red Cross. We were building, um, kua homes in Barangay 83-C, and they were just designed to be replacements for their homes that people were living in that were knocked down by Yolanda. - That's amazing. That's great. - Yeah. Lot of the mangrove trees got, uh, destroyed as well. So we've been kind of out in the shoreline, uh, kind of planting the trees. What they do is, I don't know if you're familiar with them, but they have very strong roots, and the strong roots kind of permeate and grow like a tree, uh, throughout, like, and they kind of solidify the shore. There's a certain space between the mangrove trees that you need to have, which is something that we learned from Abner. Um... so there's this whole, like, give and take between me, and Clare and Abner, who's teaching us about the kind of rules - of how they function. - Oh. We don't know. - Yeah. We know some stuff. - I mean, we know him, we're not... We know some stuff. There's no give and take. It's mostly, - he's giving us knowledge and we're helping... - Right. Yeah. - We're helping. Yeah. - ...in a small way. - So... Yeah. - Yeah. - Yeah. We're just planting those. - Yeah. Hopefully, you know, they'll do some good. - Yeah. - Yeah. I was working with the university here. Uh, we were looking at replacing the mangroves - that were originally planted... - Mmm-hmm. ...with some tissue culture samples - from a different species... - Oh, okay. - ...since the first species didn't actually take. - Oh. Um, unfortunately, now they're, uh, carrying out or building the new wall, - instead of the mangrove, right? - I'm building a compost box. I know you were talking about building, I'm building a compost box. Yeah. Yeah. It's like the first one, I think, that's gonna be in the neighborhood, - like, ever. - Well... Yeah. What's, um... Mmm-hmm. What's, uh, what's your educational background? - Ah, I just have a bachelor's degree in biology. - Wow. How long did you go to school for? Uh, it took me six years to get my bachelor's, - but I did... - Wow, that's a long time. Yeah. I did a degree in anthropology first. - Wow. - Oh, cool. - Amazing. - I didn't know that. - Well, ethnography has been really useful... - Yeah. ...for understanding various aspects of such a different culture. - And next year, I'll be enteringinto a master's in toxicology. - Wow. Which is what my project right now is centered around. - You all right? - Yeah. Are you sure? - Yes, I'm okay. - Yeah. You want me to join you in your solemn walk? You're already here, so, yes. I... hate that you're saying that's how my body looks. Less wide of a stance. A bit more... A bit more curves and swirls. - That's beautiful. - Yeah. Nilda, um, I wanted to give you a gift today. And this is for you. - Thank you. - Yeah, you can smell it. It's... Do you like the smell of it? Yes, I like it. Good smell. - It's nice. - Yeah. It's called lavender. I know it has kind of a funny smell but it grows in our garden at home, so my mom cut it and sent it to me to give it to you. - Oh, yes. Tell your mom "thank you." - I will! I will. This is a flower from Canada to Philippines. I guess it's a bit silly for the flowers to travel on a plane. It's also not just a flower. It also has, like, medicinal purposes. Oh, yes. Nice. The smell is meant to make you feel relaxed. It's nice smell. I'm relaxed. Yeah. So it's good for sleeping or rests for Arnel and so... I just thought because you don't have lavender in the Philippines, that would be nice. I have. I do. I see I have lavender. - Oh, okay. Sure. - Can you hold this? Yes. Where did you put my... Fuck! This one, I have lavender. Smell. You can smell this one. It's very good. Okay, yeah, that's lavender there. Okay. I guess I didn't need to bring this then. Okay. So let's talk about why we're here today, okay? Uh, let's talk about safety first. I, you know, don't wanna hold the knife by that saw blade. So, uh, you know, I love the food here, okay? I love it, uh, but it's a lot of meat, right? Uh, it's a lot of meat and rice. Not a lot of veggies, so... You know, what kind of veggies do you, do you like or that grow here? - I don't really know many. - Yeah, so many vegetables. Oh, there are so many? Okay. - Okay, what are some of them? - Eggplant. Repolio. - Malunggay. - Okay. Camote tops, petsai, squash. - Sayote. Ampalaya. - Okay, that's a lot. - Mangoes. Tomato. - Okay. - Mmm... - Yeah. Are you... - Potatoes. - That's... Uh, we can talk about that later. - Uh, but that's... I didn't know about that. - Carrots? - Yeah, it's carrots. - Carrots. Uh, but where did the veggies come from, right? That's kind of what we're taking about today. They come from the soil, right? So, we wanna make sure that this stuff is fertile and ready to grow. That's what the compost bin is gonna do. So, Arnel, do you wanna come on down here and help me out here? Clare, can I ask you something, uh, personal question? - Yeah, of course. - Um, are you Catholic? Uh... I feel like I'm like a spiritual person. But I'm not... I've never reallygone to church before so I don't, you know... But not... I know a lot of Catholic people at home, great people. There's traditions that we take part in, you know, like Christmas and, um... is one, and then maybe Saint Patrick's Day. Is that here? I think that that's, uh, Catholic, but, um... No, I think it's great. I, I would love to have something to really believe in. So I believe in myself and, and people, mostly. - Okay. - Yeah. - Wait. - What? No, it's okay. There we go. Now we're get... Now we're getting somewhere. You build anything else? Oh, yeah. Easy-peasy. Now we gotta kind of, like, both... Hey, Arnel, can you go get me some water? - Okay. - Thanks, man. This is house of my sister. And here is our kitchen. And then this one is our bedroom. Living room for, uh, watching TV, and singing and dancing. The baby is falling down there from the terrace and also my sister. Falling down there. That's bad. I can sing, uh, before. Now I don't know how to sing. - Trevor? - Hmm? Do you ever think about what's gonna happen when you die? Don't worry, you're a good person, you know that. You don't have to worry about anything. You go... You'll go to a good place. And who determines, you know, what's good enough from... How do you know what's good enough? You don't. But God, God doesn't forget we're Catholics and Christians. Some people just... It's ghosts for them, some people. It's just ghosts. What do you believe's gonna happen to you? I don't know. I'm at a heavy metal concert. It's so big. And also... Give me a hot dog. Music. Music. Just turn on the music. One more. Can I have one more?- - Thanks very much. Who do I talk to if we wanna whale watch? What are you working on? Uh, I was just gonna post a photo of Arnel, but I can't decide between these two photos. I like this one because he looks happy, and then this one, he's got a hammer, which I like, because it shows his commitment to the project and what we're doing, but he doesn't look as happy as the other one. Yeah, he really looks like he doesn't wanna be there, right? - Well, it was hot. - Yeah. Yeah, he looks not happy. You look nice, though. You look really happy in that picture. Yeah, but it's not about me. It's about him. - I want people to know about Arnel. - Mmm-hmm. You know, that's what... Maybe if... Hmm. Maybe if I photoshop the hammer hand onto the body of the Arnel that's smiling, then you can get kind of the best of both worlds. Yeah... Do you think that maybe it's a bit problematic, though, to be creating an image of something that never existed? Well, that's fair to say, but I think that there are two types of photos. There's one that captures a moment. And there's another type that collects moments to create an experience, and that's what I'm trying to do. There are more dimensions to Arnel than just one moment. You know, like, sometimes he's happy with the hammer, sometimes he's not happy hammering. Sometimes he's... unhappy, but he doesn't have the hammer. And sometimes, he is happy without... - the hammer. - Hmm. So it's, like... it's more... It's more dimensions. Two hundred forty, seventy, eighty... - Ninety. - ...ninety. Fuck! Ugh! Did your computer crash? No, my mom relapsed. She's... on oxygen and she's awake, but... Okay. Um, is there anything that you need to do right now? There's nothing really I can do. ♪ Baby, you're always in my heart ♪ I wanna say I love you ♪ I don't know where to start ♪ So come and walk with me now, baby ♪ Hello. Right, ah... Okay. ♪ The love that I knew ♪ Is living again ♪ And nothing else matters ♪ We're together again ♪ And nothing else matters ♪ We're together again Oh! Lovely! Hmm? - No. - Yeah. She's a good Catholic girl. - Are you okay? - Yeah. Sorry. It's just been a while. - Where are you guys from? - Canada. You ever seen a whale shark before? - No. - They're beautiful. Largest fish in the ocean. Something like 3,000 teeth, you know? They don't use 'em. - They just drink plankton. - Hmm. Internationally protected. I think there's still hunted here in the Philippines in some places. Savage, really. I'm gonna be there in the water with you the whole time. We're not that far from the shore. - Yep. - I'll be there. - Okay. - And if you want to get out at any point, just let me know. - Okay. - I'll get out with you. - It's gonna be fine. - It's gonna be fun. Okay, yes. It's gonna be fun. - It's beautiful out here. - Mmm-hmm. Be it done unto me according to thy word, and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us. Pray for us, oh, Holy mother of God. That we may be made worthy of the promises of Christ. - Amen. - Amen. Okay, I think this food is now safe to eat. You guys wanna come spearfishing with me tonight? It's fantastic. It's best to go after sundown, at night, as late as possible. The fish are actually asleep. They're in kind of holding patterns. It's very easy to drag them back. It's quite fun. Yeah, that sounds good. - Yeah? - That sounds fun. Clare? Uh, the idea of traipsing around in the dark with a spear gun shooting fish sounds like a nightmare. So, I think I'll pass. There's not a lot of traipsing, you're in the water. But, you're into it? I'll pick you up around 9:00 or 10:00, you're in 106? - Yeah, yeah. - Perfect. You know what, Clare, you can go squid fishing with my brother or you can go with me to see the fireflies. It's amazing. That sounds very nice. Thank you. I'd love that. That'd be great. - Then I'll just... - Yeah, thank you. Great. So, then, the mango... Sorry. The... The mangrove trees, what they do, is they support the shoreline with the roots. It's kind of... It's kind of, like, coverage. It's a good thing. It's sweet. It's very good. You should feel good about that. - It's interesting. - What are you, uh... What are you doing here? Are you two on vacation? No. So you're here for business then? Um, yes, I'm here for work, yes. Hmm. What kind of work do you do? I'm in insurance. Lots of people like to invest in various parts of the country. Uh, but after the storm, and other events like that, they like to know the risks associated with that. And I'm here to report back on that risk. So... Um... so you must be working in, um, Tacloban. - It seems there's a lot of... - Yes, primarily, yes. Oh, good. There needs to be a lot of reconstruction in that city. I agree. Very insightful comment, Trevor. Thank you. What kind of construction are we talking about? It's, like, um... Hospitals or... - schools? - No. No, it would be private enterprise. - Industrial, commercial businesses... - What part of Tacloban? ...various businesses. Um, mostly along the water, the shore, the unlivable areas. Um, they're not unlivable. We know people that live there. That's dangerously stupid of them to do so. Reckless, in my opinion, to be quite frank. So it's, it's, it's not okay for people to live there, but it's okay for companies to make money there. Last time I checked, people having more money to survive is a good thing. You can agree with that, can't you? That's a very vague thing you're asking me to agree with. Yes, money can help people improve their lives. - There it is. - Don't touch me, please. No, uh, what I've learned is that, kind of, money can't buy you everything, you know, like people lived full, well lives before money was invented. Listen... To put it bluntly, a lot of people with a lot of money want to put that money in this country, and that's a good thing. I think history has shown a lot. I mean, countries like this have had things stolen from them for hundreds of years, just so other people can have a lot. Yourself included. Yes, yes. But I am trying to do something good with what I've been given. Listen, thank you for the history lesson. I appreciate it. I'm sorry. I've had a little bit too much to drink. Let's... - agree to disagree. - Just don't... Don't touch me. You know, there would be a lot less suffering in the world if there were fewer people like you. Sorry, Tala. I'm gonna go. Good night, Clare. So... should I not go with Jerry tonight to go spearfishing? I think I just want to be alone right now. Okay. Okay. Sorry. Bye. The night before Yolanda, we slept peacefully. It was around... 8:00 when my mother, she just panicked. She was telling us to evacuate because we might get trapped. She prepared for a rope. We jumped out of the roof. I jumped first. And then my brothers and sisters followed. I had to attend to them. That was what my mother said to me. I thought she was gonna follow us, but then she got trapped, and she gave up. After the storm passed, here comes Jerry, offering me help to feed my brothers and sisters. I have no choice. I think that he's a bad person. Could you bring me to Canada? Could you give me a job? I think that that's a very complicated process. I'm sorry. My mother used to tell me a story about this old woman who used to wander in these trees. She protects the trees where the fireflies live. They say the fireflies glow to remind us that if we harm the trees, we invite the anger of this woman. Is that too thick? Is that right? It's fine. You're doing great. Yeah. Thank you. Your fingers! - Hey. - What happened to your foot? Oh. Uh... I just... cut it on that coral reef. It's not a big deal. It's not... It's just not a normal cut. It's just kind of spreading a bit, but I'm fine. Ooh, that... looks good. Hey, big man! Wanna go with your brother? Thank you. I always shared a seat with my brother. I liked it. I liked it. All right. Ooh, squid. Oh. - Eat. - Okay. Just... I've never had it. So... Here we go. Oh, it's okay. I'm fine. Yep. Okay. Here, let me take that. - It's actually not that bad. - What happened to you? Just spearfishing. Oh. Yeah. - Okay. Okay. Lay down. Lay down. Yeah. - Okay. - What happened to you? - I cut it on some coral reef when I was spearfishing. We will go to hospital. I think I'll be all right. I, uh... So that you can take medicine for your pain. I'm so sorry. I don't, I don't speak... Why... I'm sorry. Uh, we are inviting you to attend a discussion about the demolition here in this community. Okay, thank you. Yeah. Thank you so much. Clare... can we go to the hospital? - What? - I think my foot's infected. Can we go? - Yeah. - Hospital. - Yeah. Okay. - Yeah. I'm sorry about all this. Why? It's late. I woke you up. I'm, I'm sorry. No, it's good. It's good we're here. I'm glad. It's crazy that we're here. - Mmm-hmm. - I'm not surprised, though. We've been through a whole lot of crazy shit this past while. Mmm-hmm. I hurt my leg. Ow! I think I should go. What? I have people back at home who need me, like my mom. I, I need to be around her and... Help her. It's not that bad, actually. It's all right. - Thank you. - Thank you. So, um... I gotta let you know that, um, I have to leave early. Um, I got some stuff back at home... with my mom and I need to be there for her. But this isn't a goodbye. It's, it's really... It's kind of a beginning. And where I'm from, we kind of have a saying, which is like, "See you later, man." So I will see you later. You need to give me money. Sari-Sari store, you should buy for us. How much does it usually cost to buy a Sari-Sari store? Is it... Are they big? Is it a... like a grocery store or something like this? It's okay. All right. Well, love you. Love you, too. - Be safe. - Bye. Hey. Yeah. Do you want to play with me? ♪ My apple, apple kiss ♪ My darling, darling sweet ♪ Look at the rainbow ♪ Under the sunshine ♪ Forever more, more ♪ More, more, more good fish
