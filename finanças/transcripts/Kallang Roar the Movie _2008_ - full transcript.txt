Why like that? Laksa here is not nice is it? Why suddenly you want to go back to Singapore? It is the mee pok. You are telling me that you want to go back to Singapore because you miss... mee pok? Hey boy, go home and play somewhere else! Uncle, why you bully small boy? That small boy is Malaysia's next football star. How did you know? Three hours under the hot sun, shoelaces untied, perfect balance. You, always like that. Run faster! No need to make my bodyguard run all the way over there. Look, Uncle, I am not your boss, neither am I your enemy. I am your friend. I am not going to let you go. I made you coach and you made us champions. In my entire life, I don't know how to pay you back and thank you for all that, old friend. You call me old friend. So, it is settled then. Okay? You are staying, right? Abang, you cannot force the lion to drink water when the lion is not thirsty. You leave me no choice, my friend. Now I know you cannot tahan the temptation of fresh kueh lapis. You stay and you can have all the kueh lapis you want. Take one, just take one, lah. You want to go back to Singapore for what? All these years, they never hired you. They never gave you a chance. Singapore football must learn to take care of itself. And I am Singaporean. One last chance, my friend. Here, you have everything you don't have back home. Money, fame, respect. What is it that you have back home that you cannot have over here? Mee pok. Singapore gathering themselves from the back, taking charge with Samad Allapitchay, the captain, stroking the ball to Zainal Abidin in midfield. Zainal... Dollah now, he keeps it, he beats one man and he sends it over to Kim Song who picks up... And yes, he's looking at Mohammad... Once again, it seems that Kim wants to take the ball and run into goal. He's brought down in the box! Noh... He sends it across diagonally to Mohammad Noh who tracks... Yes, Kim Song with... It's one-nil for Singapore! It's unbelievable! The supporters are on their feet. Kallang Roar The Movie I... I have to go. But you just got back. Job interview. Makan first. Job interview first. What's that? Nothing. What's that? Let me see. Kueh lapis. You are not a small boy anymore. You are a diabetic, no kueh lapis. -One piece. -No. Where are you all going? No need to wait already. You don't know who that is? Who is he? What happened to all of them? Hungry maybe? You know what? Now I am also feeling a bit hungry. And since everyone has already gone to eat, why don't I interview you tomorrow? Why not today? Then I can prepare for training tomorrow. Tomorrow is better. Today is better. How about you leave me your name and I will get back to you? Choo Seng Quee. I heard about you. Very good tactician. See you tomorrow, okay? Hey! I am also hungry, hungry for success. How can you be hungry for food when Singapore is hungry for football? Mr. Choo, do you want this job? Yes. If you want this job, you better start learning how to speak to me properly. I will try. -Good. -So... What are you hungry for? I am hungry for a nice bowl of laksa. Why don't you take that laksa... and shove it up your self-important... Gentlemen, in the Malaysian Cup we are facing state teams. If we cannot beat them, we might as well pack our bags and go home. Our focus should be on international competitions. That is the only way that we can improve. Here I have prepared some blueprints, including a tournament for our under-17 youths. It is called... the Lion City Cup. Thank you. This will be the world's first international under-17 football tournament. First and foremost, Mr. Choo, you said that the Malaysia Cup is not important. Well, I disagree. The cup generates revenue and great interest in the sport. And for 12 years we can't even win it. Let alone international competitions. I did not mean that the Malaysia Cup is not important. It is important to gauge our strength with our neighbors, but, ultimately, we must aim higher. Sure, sure. What, "Sure, sure"? Your "sure, sure" tells me your mind is as narrow as the corridor outside. For both Indonesia and Malaysia, I was not hired to be a state team coach. I was hired to change the entire nation's footballing system. Football... is the very fabric of our nation. It bonds family members of all ages and people of all races. All I want... is to share my experience in any way that I can. Money is not an issue, you can pay me whatever you want. As long as you give me a chance to help with my own country's football. Yes, Mr. Choo, we know your credentials, but let me ask you one question. Do you have any paper qualifications as a coach? We will notify you again if you are selected. Thank you. Wait! Why does a coach who has coached both the Malaysian and Indonesian national teams into champions need paper qualifications? Mr. Ganesan, are you above the law? Are you able to guarantee his success? Okay, gentlemen, the meeting is adjourned. I will make it my lifelong ambition to make sure you never become coach. Uncle, wait. Gani. I was wondering if it was really you inside there. You have really grown. Last time only this tall. Sorry, Uncle, the board only has confidence in you as a master tactician, but not as a coach. Last time, you were riding a tiny little bicycle outside my house, remember? We threw that bicycle long ago. I'm sure. You were so fat, the entire bicycle collapsed underneath you... -Uncle... -...and that's when I gave you a football. Gani, there can be many reasons why you are in the association. I hope you are here because of football. Wait for me, Uncle. Things will change. Be a man of your word, Mr. Ganesan. Because you know, I will wait. What are you doing now? The phone will ring. Hello? -Hi, is this Uncle Choo? -Yup. We heard that the association is not interested in you even when you are offering your services for free. How do you feel about being a world-class coach who has never coached your own nation? Sayang, sometimes when people don't want you, it means they really don't want you. Cheer up. You can have more time to spend at home. What's wrong? Where are you going? They don't give me a team, I build my own. Boys, we are all here because we love football. And all of you are here because you are special. Most of you have talent and brains, but to become champions in football, even if you have talent and brains, if you have no endurance, if you have no passion, then you are not even worth a pinch of salt. If all of you can endure my training... Mat Noh, don't sit by yourself, join them. Good. If all of you can endure my training, you stand a chance to compete for a place in the national team. What makes you think your training will make us champions? What's your name? Samad Allapitchay. What is yours? Uncle Choo. You are "The Uncle Choo"? Samad, stand up. You, be captain. Sit down. If I am not coach by the time you become national team players, I hope you will use everything you have learnt for the glory of your nation. Learn to put your country before self. Let's start with the simplest of training, learning to sing. Stand up! Sing with me. Mari kita ra'yat Singapura Why? Mouth cannot open? Sing! Seow! Rajagopal, where are you going? So... only you will stay and sing with me, Kim Song? Okay. Let's sing. But, Uncle, I don't know how to sing. -Not fair. -Not fair. Majulah Singapura, Majulah Singapura I thought Ice Milo, this one so hot how to drink? Hey, Dollah, you no brain or what? Cold drinks after sports. Your stomach will become so weak you won't be able to walk anymore. As long as I am your coach, you must obey everything I say. Everything I do is to make you stronger. If you can't take my training, you are free to leave any time, but if you stay on, you will become a lion, and on that day when you become a lion, if you fail to use your ability to win glory for your nation, you're still not worth even a pinch of salt. Now, give me five rounds. Flat out! Look at me! If you want to become lions, you must start behaving like lions now. Before every game, I want you to chant together with me. Watch me. I will say, "Untuk Bangsa Dan Negara." Together with me, watch my hand. Majulah! Stand up! Untuk Bangsa Dan Negara. -Majulah! -Majulah! What are you doing? Waiting. I told you, don't wait anymore. Quickly go and get some rest. Someone made me a promise. Aiyoh, that was ten years ago. Hey, since you are not going to the shop today, come shopping with me at Beauty World lah. I know you want this coaching job very badly, but whether it is Indonesia, Malaysia, or even Singapore, this is the longest and happiest time I have ever had to spend with you. Stop loving football so much, and start loving yourself, can? This phone is so old already, let's change it. Hey, cannot. They might call anytime. They will call back. No, no, no, you cannot, what if they call after you pluck out the wire? You don't be stubborn like stain. You see! Hello, hello? You see, what if they call now? Okay, lah. Let's get changed and... go for breakfast. Gentlemen, inside, sits a man who can convince anyone of anything. Now, no matter what he offers us, we are here to resign because we all know what is going to happen when Uncle becomes coach. So, let's stand strong as one and go in there and resign with confidence, and force them to reconsider their decision, all right? -Yeah. -Agreed. Majid, are you sure you are not interested? You want to be assistant coach to Uncle Choo? Suit yourself. Mr. Ganesan will see you now. Thank you. Good morning, gentlemen. Morning, sir. Have a seat. Thank you. Now, gentlemen, I call the three of you into the office today because of the exceptional work you have done for the association. I plan to recommend all of you, including Majid, for pay increments in the next month. A five-month bonus is already being deposited into your account because I really need your assistance to bring glory back to our nation. Mr. Hartley, I feel that amongst all of us you have the most experience. I am promoting you from coach to technical director. You will also receive a pay increment, five months bonus, and more time to come up with new interesting solutions to revolutionize Singapore football. This is such a crucial period for us in Singapore football. Don't you gentlemen agree? Come in. Mr. Ganesan, I am so sorry, I forgot to pass you-- What are these? This is nothing, really. Good. Keep up the good work. And as you know, I am hiring Uncle, so please give him your fullest support. Thank you. -Thank you, sir. -Thank you. What happened in there? Good morning, Mr. Chairman. The board asks that you reconsider your decision of hiring Uncle, in face of the resignation of all your coaches. That is no longer a concern, gentlemen, as Uncle now has the full backing of the entire coaching staff. But he has no paper qualifications. Dear sir, do you need a degree to play football? Even as we speak, football associations of at least five nations are waiting for his signature. He is more than qualified, but why does he choose to sit in his chair for ten years offering his services to us for free? This shows that both his loyalty and qualifications are unquestionable. I plan to move all national matches from the Jalan Besar Stadium to the Kallang Stadium. This is madness, from a 20,000-seater to a 55,000-seater. Where are you going to find the additional 35,000 fans? Every game will be full. Can you guarantee that? I can. If the stadium isn't full by the third game, I will pay for every empty seat. I need the support of all of you in our goal to revolutionize Singapore football. Meeting is adjourned. Read the papers yourself, Samad. Our economy is not doing well. I don't care, okay, even if you are the captain of the ladies swimming team. How can I afford to have a worker like you who always takes leave for football? Samad, stand up. You, be captain. Yes, boss, thank you boss, I realize my mistake. I will work hard from now on. I got to run. Only you would stay and sing with me, Kim Song? Okay, let's sing. But, Uncle, I don't know how to sing. You still haven't found work? Mat Noh! May I have your autograph? Sign here. Oh, my God, it is Rahimah. -Thank you. -Thank you. Mat Noh, don't sit by yourself, join them. Sleeping again, Dollah! I thought Ice Milo, this one so hot how to drink? Hey, Dollah, you no brain or what? Hey, how much, Ah Kun? Uncle Choo, you owe me one meal. Why? You promise me what. If you ever get this job, you will treat all of us. What job? Wait. -You mean... -Hey... You never read yesterday's newspaper, meh? No wonder yesterday's newspaper had a big hole in it. Don't want to eat here anymore. Gani. Welcome back, Uncle. I almost fell asleep waiting for you. Then open your eyes, you are coach. I was thinking, a 4-4-2 to a 4-2-4 conversion for our team, what do you think? I think this is your decision. You don't have any favorite formation. No, you are the coach, your call. I don't understand, what's the catch? On a serious note, the board is ready to fire you and remove me the moment you make a mistake. So keep bringing back success, and we will both stay very long in Singapore football. Then I guess I... I guess I better get started. Knock it down! -Majulah! -Majulah! Get up. Get up. Is that beer, Raja? You go and give me 100 corner kicks now. Cannot, Uncle. Haven't train so long already, the ball sure fly anyhow. Are you going to do it? Cannot lah. You may be the best player here, but it breaks my heart each time you carry on drinking like that. One last time, are you going to do the corner kicks? Uncle, what are you going to do? Kick your best player out? Get out from my team. Get out from my team! Seow! Rajagopal, where are you going? Rest of you, get up. Centralized training is about to begin. All of you will take leave from your employers and stay together as a team in the Jalan Besar dormitory. Those that cannot make time or take my style of training, please leave now. Good. Also, from now on, I will introduce something called UCPF, Uncle Choo Provident Fund. I will keep 10 percent of your allowance each month that will go into helping a teammate in need. At the end of the day, if the money is not needed, at least you will have some savings. The full amount will of course be returned to you. Uncle, can I not contribute? Five rounds. My boys, I am happy that you are finally here, representing your national team. Something that I have been training most of you for many years ago, but... before you go all yaya papaya about playing for your national team, I want to tell you that all of you are not even worth a pinch of salt! You are not a lion because you look like a lion, but because you play like a lion! A lion is nothing unless he learns how to roar! I want to know whether all of you still remember how to roar! Untuk Bangsa Dan Negara! -Majulah! -Majulah! A nice cross from Mohammad Noh... Yes, it's a goal! And here comes Kim Song to give Singapore the lead. What ecstasy in the National Stadium. Three minutes per person. Now, whatever your family needs in terms of rice and milk, make a note, and Mr. Ganesan will make sure it is delivered to your house. Don't take longer than you need. Hello? Yeah, we are all here now. Yup, everything is fine. Nope, no need to cut botak. Yeah, yeah, okay, bye. So fast? Then you give me some of your time lah? Two minutes plus three minutes, then got five minutes lah? No such thing. I hantam you then you know, carry on. Joking lah. Come on, pick up. Come on, pick up, pick up. Come on, please lah, pick up lah tolong lah. Time's up Hey, wait, wait, not yet. See, got through already. Hello? -Hello? -Hello? Who are you looking for? Hello? Hey, who are you? What are you doing in my house? Wrong number lah. Alamak. What happened? Wrong number. Rahimah. So, how's everything? You know lah, torture. Come on, you do it for Singapore, right? You do lah. I sing, you play football. You can't sing, not like I can't play football. You can play football? I can play football. Maybe even better than you. Hey, public place. Five seconds also complain. Okay lah, time to go. Okay. Why? Miss your girlfriend? New photo, never seen before. Got special autograph some more. Don't disturb Mat lah. Mr. Fitness Program, I having fun only what, why so serious? Alamak, everybody so serious, I miss Rajagopal lah. I have too many serious people living around me. Gentlemen, listen up. All the coaches have gone home for the night to have a good night's rest, thanks to Mr. Ganesan. Yes! But old man is still around. Relax, don't worry I can handle him. He is going to be in his room most of the time. So how? Want to party or not? You sure you can handle old man? I know Uncle like the back of my hand. I put a whole box of kueh lapis on his table. When he sees the kueh lapis, he is going to eat everything. Okay? How? On? Let's go. Hey, Mat, want to go or not? Don't want lah. Then you better not bao toh us. Yeah, if we get caught, I hantam you. Okay, lah, I go lah. I stand outside. Good, then you can become bouncer. Kim Song? Kim Song? Seow, still doing push-ups. Never mind, you don't see him crazy-crazy like seow on like that. I ask him to go, he sure go one. Gentlemen, let's suit up. Hey, Gelek King, you really know how to gelek tonight. Gelek! Hey, not as well as Kim Song, he like turbo like that. Relax, gentlemen. You're very lucky tonight. Usually Uncle has got... eyes at the back of his head. Understand? Down. One hundred, Uncle! Down. One hundred and one, Uncle! Flat out. Knock it down. Look at me. When you drink, you throw away your stamina. When you womanize, you throw away your face. Are all of you still little kids? Don't you have any dignity? Down. One hundred and two, Uncle! You listen to me. Centralised training... is not easy. But one day, when you are old, and cannot play football anymore, will you look back and say that, "In 1977, if I had trained just one more day, I could have won that cup." How many chances in life do you get to be champions? History has no sympathy for the defeated. We are either champions... or nothing. Today, you are faced with a decision because tomorrow's training will be even tougher. If you decide to go, you might as well go home now in your party clothes, I won't stop you. If you stay, I promise you that you will be champions. I will give you time to decide. Tomorrow morning, I will know your answer. Mari kita ra'yat Singapura Sama-sama Menuju bahagia Cita-cita kita Yang mulia Berjaya Singapura Marilah kita bersatu ...and it's a goal! Rajagopal has scored the winner! And yes, it's a goal. Lovely shot at goal... Rajagopal... And it's a goal! One-nil to Singapore. What ecstasy in the National Stadium. Hey, why are you eating so little rice? Uncle say-- I don't care what Uncle says. Don't waste food, eat more rice. Who ask you to eat so much... You again? What do you mean, "You again?" How dare you? Who ask them to eat more rice? I did. Why? You like rice, is it? If you like rice so much, why don't you take the rice... and shove it up your self-important... How can our own coach treat any of us board members this way? There is no respect. I suggest that he be replaced immediately. No one is going anywhere. I will get to the bottom of this. Mr. Ganesan, I think the board is getting tired of all this nonsense. If this goes on, I recommend Mr. Hartley to replace Uncle Choo as coach. Can you stop coming up with creative names for him? Why do you have to quarrel with him, even over rice? I need to build up my players with proteins, not carbohydrates. And that fella ask them to eat more rice. I need to build up my players' strength, not their weight. Does he know sports science at all? Some more my players ate so much rice, they are all swollen like balloons. They can't run, and my training is cancelled! Listen, Gani, you are the boss. You decide who is right, who is wrong. But if we can't fight for even the smallest things, how are we going to fight for the bigger things? Like welfare for players, care for players. Every grain of rice counts, Gani. Listen up. From now on, all your instructions come directly from Uncle. No one else can override his command at any time. If there is any problem, you come directly to me. Do I make myself clear? -Yes, sir. -Yes, sir. All of you all will be compensated for today's wasted day, but there will be no repeat of today, clear? -Yes, sir. -Yes, sir. Uncle, you are right. It's my responsibility to keep anyone from interfering with your training. From now on, the players will answer only to you. Stupid old fool. No training! Guys, wake up, get up, get up, get up. Hi, boss. I'm still in the middle of centralised training. I just came to take something. You can collect everything. Boss? No. No, boss no, I-- I watch football too, Samad. You are a great footballer, but perhaps, you are not a good employee. My family... Boss, my house, I still have not paid my house in full. The company decided to let you go... the moment your centralised training started. If you think about your family, you wouldn't play football. -Boss. -Pack your things. -Boss. -Pack your things. No. So how? Your commission, what are you going to do? Get drinks, see Geylang girls, what else? Geylang, I heard there's this new stall that sell the beef kway teow, just opened last week. Samad. How are you? Who are you? Who am I? I am the one behind all your team's victories in the tournament so far. You should at least know who I am. I came here today because... I need your help. Are you a bookie? No. That would be illegal. Let's just say I am someone who can control the score and make a lot of people very happy. It is people like you who spoil the game. Who do you work for? Singapore? Malaysia? I work for money, and so do you. You... just lost your job. What is going to happen to your wife and son? -What the hell are you doing? -Get back! -Back! -Samad, Samad-- Touch them and I will kill you! Samad, I am a businessman. I don't interfere... in your affairs. I don't care about you, your family or your pain... as long as I get what I want. I want you to make a little mistake in your next match. A mistake so little that it will cost the Singapore team her victory. Just show us that you can do it, and your family will be safe. -So where are we going tonight? -I told you, beef kway teow. Hey, isn't that Rajagopal? Shall we? Shall we what? Look at him. Completely useless bum. He is not a legend. Forget about him, come I will treat you kopi. Hey, boy, shut up lah. I drop my money. I wanted to go and buy a pair of football boots with the money that I saved up, but then I thought it was better to let my mother have it, and now... I lost it. Stop crying lah, you sissy, if cannot find then how? Cry all day? I'll starve to save up again. Why you want a pair of football boots so much? Someone once told me that if I have a pair of football boots, I can play for the national team, just like you, Mr. Rajagopal. What happened to you? I am not playing for the national team anymore lah. Why? Your banana kick spoil? The crazy coach won't let me. Why Uncle won't let you play? Because I... Because he is a crazy coach lah. Why is he a crazy coach? He ask me to train 100 corner kicks everyday. Crazy fella. Yeah, crazy. Correct, right? Yeah, a star like you trains more than that. I know that the gift of becoming the king of banana kicks doesn't just fall from heaven. You must have trained more than 100 corner kicks a day to achieve that. You are right, Mr. Rajagopal. The boots mean nothing at all without training. I must earn my own pair of football boots. Thank you for your advice, Mr. Rajagopal. Bye-bye. Now even the small boy start talking like you. Uncle, I hate the fact that you are always right lah. I, Rajagopal, will not touch another bottle again... until I win back the cup for Singapore. Enough! One hundred corner kicks. Go to sleep. Has everyone read the 15 pages I printed out? Has everyone memorized the 15 pages I printed out? Dollah, page four? Chin Aun? You're guessing. But you're right. Samad, page ten? Their dangerman, Mokhtar. Edmund. -Yes, Uncle. -What is on page one? Arumugam, their super goalkeeper. Hey, Edmund, confident! You will be playing instead of Eric Paine tonight. Raja. I'm ready. Good. Boys, the team you're about to face has almost the entire Malaysian national team in their squad. They will play very rough to try and scare you into submission, why? Because this is not their turf. This is the lion's den, our den! Everybody together now! Untuk Bangsa Dan Negara! -Majulah! -Majulah! And the atmosphere is simply electrifying in this Malaysia Cup semi-final between Singapore and Selangor as the players troop out on to the pitch to do battle royal. Singapore led by Samad Allapitchay and Selangor led by "The Towkay" himself, Soh Chin Aun. It's Singapore kicking off the game with Rajagopal now, passing the ball back to Zainal Abidin. Up it goes to Mohammad Noh facing The Towkay himself, Soh Chin Aun. Chin Aun stops him dead in his tracks. Mohammad Noh looking absolutely frustrated as Selangor come forward. And it's Mokhtar Dahari on the ball, and he is going to be taunting Edmund Wee, and yes, by a stroke of luck, Edmund gathered that. It's Dollah Kassim sending the ball over to Mohammad Noh who beats one man, gets into the Selangor penalty area and now crosses. Kim Song with the diving header and what a save from Arumugam. Selangor attack. Chin Aun over to Mokhtar Dahari. Here he comes, the scourge of the Singapore backline. He shoots, and he hits the upright. And another one, well saved by Edmund Wee. And here comes Super Mokh! Hey, Edmund, confident! And Edmund was brave enough to stop that from getting into the back of his net. Pass it now! Edmund Wee gets Singapore back on the attack. Mohammad Noh gets round one Selangor defender, gets into the box. Lovely cross. And here comes Kim Song with his trademark diving header to give Singapore the lead. Yeah! What ecstasy in the National Stadium. Selangor kick off the second half, trailing Singapore by one goal to nil in this 1977 Malaysia Cup semi-final. Mokhtar Dahari, a man on a mission as he weaves past a couple of Singapore defenders, and now he takes a lovely shot, and what a great save there from Edmund Wee. Deep concern from the Singapore bench as Selangor move into the attack. What is going to happen to your wife and son? Samad looking pretty concerned, and a little slip up there allowing Mokhtar Dahari to go through. And Mokhtar shoots, and this is not looking good for Singapore as Mokhtar Dahari equalizes for Selangor. It's one goal apiece. And the traditional Kallang Roar has been silenced by Super Mokh. Dollah Kassim with the ball right now, little shimmy, but Chin Aun stops him, and he stands up only to face the yellow card. Come on, man, ref, my player was fouled! What kind of decision was that? -Stop it, get back -You open your eyes, you understand? Get back! Referee Kayu lah, Balik Kampoung lah! -Referee Kayu! Referee Kayu! -Referee Kayu! Referee Kayu! -Referee Kayu! Referee Kayu! -Referee Kayu! Referee Kayu! This is not looking good for Singapore as Super Mokh works his way into the penalty box, and he shoots. Edmund stands his ground. Raja! Yes, Coach. Play defense. But I am an attacker lah. I cannot play as a defender. You want to play or not? And here comes Super Mokh once again troubling the Singapore defense, but S. Rajagopal puts in a brilliant tackle. Go, Raja! Raja, all the way! Singapore back into the attack, and a lovely run here getting past a couple of Selangor players, and it's Rajagopal on the far side, and here he comes. Chin Aun comes in just in the nick of time, giving away a corner as he stops Rajagopal. This is not looking good for Selangor because they were told not to give away a corner. And it looks like Raja is limping, it is left leg that's injured. Here, drink. Hey, ref, relax lah, water break. -I don't want. -He don't want. He want. You better drink this down like a camel. Make it fast. This is the only time I let you drink. Treasure it. Rajagopal, banana kick! Rajagopal, the banana-kick specialist, is focused on this task now as he spots the ball to take this corner, but remember he just injured his left leg, and he is a natural left-footer, so what is it he is going to be doing? An inswinger with his right boot? Which is pretty unusual, but he does it. Goal! Rajagopal has scored the winner from this inswinging corner. That gives Singapore the victory in this semi-final by two goals to one. They now go into the final to meet Penang at the Merdeka Stadium. You gave that man a beer? No. I gave that man a Tiger. Beer. I want beer. You know, this is not easy, Mat. Every time I am with you, I am very happy, but it can never last. What's the purpose of being happy when it can never last? Have you found a job? If you have something important to attend to, you can go, I am fine. No, I am here. Where is Kim Swee and Kim Lye? They are all busy. You must be tired too. No, I am fine. Pa. Pa! I fell asleep. Kim Swee. You should talk to Kim Song. I don't want to see him ending up like you. I don't want him to have a scar on his face for the sake of football. Kim Song should think about his future. Find a good job. There is no future in playing football. His leg. He is about to lose his leg to gangrene. He was supposed to go for operation three months ago. He didn't say a word? Success isn't everything, Mr. Ganesan. Don't be selfish. Gentlemen, we have all heard about Uncle's condition by now. The agenda of this emergency meeting is therefore to make a final decision of whether Uncle will stay as coach for the final between Singapore and Penang. Uncle Choo made a passionate plea to all Singaporeans to take the Kallang Roar to the Merdeka Stadium and cheer the team to victory. With utmost respect for Uncle Choo, I think he may be too weak to make the right decisions for the game, but the team he has built up is very strong. A promising move from Mohammad Noh. No! This is not easy, Mat. And that was pretty unusual for Mohammad Noh. Rajagopal with the ball, he is hit from behind and it doesn't really look good for Raja and especially for Singapore. And it looks like it's going to be the end of the night for Raja. And I think they can take his absence as a form of encouragement to perform even better. A nice cross from Mohammad Noh, and yes, it's a goal. Kim Song with the lovely diving header ...to give Singapore the one-goal lead they really need. What ecstasy here. There is no future in playing football. Uncle may be a good coach, but sometimes there are things in this world that can make even the strongest fall. Ali Bakar for Penang getting past Mutalib. He is faced by Samad Allapitchay, Samad falls. Isa picks up the ball and he puts it in! Yes, Isa Bakar has given Penang a lifeline here with that equalizing goal. So it's one apiece. I think circumstances have already made a decision for us. We must let poor Uncle rest. Mr. Hartley, in light of Uncle's condition, I'd like to hear how you feel about taking over the team for the final tonight. Nice piece of football here from Isa Bakar, laying the ball for Ali Bakar. Yes, it's in! The ball goes past Edmund Wee. What a turnaround here in the Malaysia Cup final. Penang lead two goals to one. Is Singapore gonna be disintegrating at this point? It would be an honor to take over. But I won't. Mr. Ganesan, the one thing I have failed to achieve as technical director so far is to change your people's lack of belief in your own talents. Foreign talent can build a foundation, but ultimately, you must cultivate a self-belief to succeed. You must give your own football geniuses a chance, and you have one right now who would give even his life just to coach for another 90 minutes. Who am I to stand in his way? I, for one, will resign if he is removed. Then Uncle stays. Let's talk. Do you know... what the greatest fuel of a warrior is? Love. When something you really want fails to work, you must not run away. You must fight to make it work. Mat, I need you now, your team needs you now. Don't think so much. Earn this victory, and then, go and marry her. Song, I don't think I am the man you need to hear from right now. Song, actually I have always been following your matches. I never told you... because I didn't want you to become too proud. Son, don't lose hope, pick yourself up, and bring honor to the family. What are you doing here? I also want words of motivation. I just saw the doctor not long ago. He said I have gangrene. Basically, that means I have to cut off my leg. I... love my leg! It helps me to walk to the Kallang Stadium to watch all of you! For you, your legs are your gift! A gift to thrill millions of people! Nobody remembers a losing team. Some people support a fighting team. Tonight, I want a winning team! I want a team of legends! I want us to go down in history as being the team that brings back the cup home. Tonight, I want Kallang to roar with pride again. I hope that all of you remember how to roar. Untuk Bangsa Dan Negara! -Majulah! -Majulah! You have taken out Samad and Rajagopal. What tactics could you possibly have left? Don't worry, Gani. Taking Samad off is a strategy. We caught the bookies who have been threatening your family. Your wife and son are safe. Thank you for your courage. Thank you for protecting my family, Uncle. Anything you want, you just say it. It will be done. Once the opposition thought that my captain could not be trusted, they went all out to finish us off. Now, they have run out of stamina, and I will use my Crazy Horse. Singapore come back for the second half with renewed hope, especially, with the introduction of super-sub, Nasir Jalil, better known as "Crazy Horse", to inject new energy and vigor into the side. Nasir Jalil. First half, you don't play, you don't watch, you don't listen. Second half, you go in and you chase down every opponent that has the ball. You give the entire team leg cramps, and show them the true meaning of the Crazy Horse! Nasir Jalil chasing for every ball, and yes, he really works his socks off for the team. And Penang has given the ball away. Nasir picks it up. As the ball is now passed on to Mohammad Noh. The very elegant Mohammad Noh gets past one, and now another, to Dollah Kassim. The Gelek King, yes, he gets past between two players and he takes a shot. Cool down, cool down. Come back, come back. There you are. And Dollah has missed that opportunity. And Penang are coming back, but the problem is some of the players are down with cramps, and that's another one. And Nasir Jalil's harassment has paid off as he regains possession for Singapore, he's looking around for a teammate to pass to. -No one there. -Go! -Go, go, go! -Go, go, go! He gets the ball forward, goes past one defender, and now the final player, and the goalkeeper. He rounds the goalkeeper and he backheels the ball. Super-sub Nasir Jalil has equalized for Singapore. It's incredible! Unbelievable, even Nasir looks shocked. It's Singapore two, Penang two. No quarter given, no quarter asked as Singapore and Penang battle it, with Nasir Jalil down. He's injured. The hero for the night at the moment giving Singapore a lifeline, and Dollah Kassim is tackled from behind. And yes, the Penang boys are dishing out some of the rough stuff. And the Singapore side finding it hard, but they're standing brave against Penang, determined to win the Malaysia Cup this year. Mohammad Noh gets past one, but not the second. That was a bad tackle to bring Mohammad Noh down, and he stands up right now to confront the player. Tempers are beginning to fray, and Mohammad Noh gets a yellow card. Tensions are really mounting high here at the Merdeka Stadium, and I wonder what's going through the mind of the master motivator. And Penang are certainly driving forward time and again. They're coming back in droves as they interchange passes, with Isa Bakar on the ball, and yes, indeed a shot. And well-stopped by Edmund Wee, with the players scrambling in right now to make sure that the ball goes over the line, and the Penang players are celebrating a goal. No, no, no! Take my leg, but let them win. No goal! The referee checks, and he says it's no goal. The goal has been disallowed, and that gives Singapore renewed hope. Singapore on a quick counter attack right now with Quah Kim Song. Kim Song, Kim Song, Kim Song! -Kim Song with his scorching pace is... -Go! Go! ...is really taking on the Penang defense, as he beats one and now another, and he gets round another, and he is approaching the top of the penalty box, and they are gonna be determined to stop... They have stopped Quah Kim Song, and in doing so, they have given away a freekick. It's gonna be an indirect free kick to Singapore. Is this going to be the moment where Singapore can actually turn the game around in their favor? And the fans are at the edge of their seats here at the Merdeka Stadium. A crucial moment indeed for Singapore. And Dollah Kassim has been given the task of taking the free kick, as the players line up at the edge of the box. Dollah looks up. He floats the ball, the players all... Quah Kim Song with the lovely diving header, and it's in! And Singapore lead by three goals to two. What joy and celebration here in the terraces of the Merdeka Stadium, and especially the fans back home in Singapore. Their dreams and hopes are with the boys here. Singapore three, Penang two. And yes, the referee has blown the final whistle. That's confirmation that Singapore has won the Malaysia Cup 1977 after 12 long years. And really the boys are in ecstasy, they are celebrating, and they deserve their moment of glory here in the Merdeka Stadium. Singapore! Singapore! Singapore! Singapore! Singapore! Singapore! Singapore! Uncle, we did it! Uncle, we did it! Uncle. Uncle. Uncle. We did it. All I ever wanted for us... was some... some self-respect. So, Uncle, how is the mee pok here? Singapore mee pok tastes... the best. Well, I guess rivalry makes two countries stronger, but at the end of the day, Uncle, we can sit down and enjoy coffee together, right? Right. Abang, this time, I pay. No, no, no, let me pay. -Let me pay, Uncle. -No, old friend. Of course I buy. This is my country, and this time, you are my guest. Come. Boy, come here. Take this box, take it. Open it. You like? Pay me back when you get famous. Thank you, Uncle. And who might that be? Fandi Ahmad.
