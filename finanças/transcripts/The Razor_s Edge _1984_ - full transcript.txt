No one in need who has ever approached you, the generous citizens of Lake Forest, Illinois, has ever been refused. Therefore, although the United States has not yet entered the war in Europe, we, of the American Ambulance Service have continued to donate men, women and equipment to aid our unfortunate wounded French and British friends. Now, I want to thank this year's graduating class of Lake Forest College for this badly needed vehicle. But more important, I want to thank the two brave members of that class who have volunteered to accompany the ambulance overseas as drivers! Mr. Gray Maturin. Hey, that's my boy! That's my boy. Thanks, Pop. And Mr. Larry Darrell. Now, in order to raise funds for this noble cause, Mr. Maturin is going to give demonstration rides around the village green for the small donation of five cents a person. The line forms to the right. You're first, ladies. Go on. I do wish Mr. Darrell had made his appearance. I assure you, Madam, whatever Mr. Darrell is doing, he's servicing the needs of your fine organization. I'm going to take this whiskey, okay? Got it. Oh, aren't you the cutest little hat-rack I've ever seen! And don't scratch that pretty face. -Kisses, one dollar? -Uh-huh. I sure will, Ma'am. There you are. One dollar. It's amazing, isn't it? I seem to have left my money in my other uniform. You mean your boy scout uniform? Well, I just take what I want. Oh, you're getting heavy! That hurt! Mm, it's nice working for free. Go on. Jump in. Larry, look, I'm supposed to be doing my patriotic duty. Come on, your patriotic duty on my last night in town is to leave me unable to walk! Come on. Oh, no, no, no, no. First, the wedding, then the honeymoon. Yeah, do it the other way around and you end up like Bob and Sophie stuck in that dumb, old apartment. I like their place. How do you think they're going to like it when the baby comes? -I don't know. -No charge to boys in uniform. Oh, well done! Very good. Our baby's going to have its own room and a nanny. Oh, come on, why don't you talk to Gray about getting married, huh? He's got a million bucks to play with. He'll go for that nanny stuff. Hey, look, I don't want a million bucks, I just want you. And half a million bucks. This is the singly most disgusting concoction in the culinary annals. Well, that didn't stop you eating a dozen of them every 4th July when you were a boy. Well, this quaint little village may have been the place of my birth, but after 15 years in Paris, I have come to regard that as a most unfortunate accident of genetics. Oh, Elliot, you are the biggest snob in the world! I sincerely hope so. Nice looking dog you've got there, huh? Oh, how I envy you, young man, after Paris, the city of light. You know, I really ought to provide you with a few introductions. I could put you in touch with some of the most elite members of the European aristocracy while you're there. Sophie! Bob! Where you guys been? Oh, Bob had to work. On a holiday? Gee, what a shame. Yeah, I almost missed seeing you and Gray off, they kept me late. Well, you're late but not too late to come with us, Bobby, boy! Put him down, he's a daddy! He's not going anywhere! Well, can Bob go away on the ambulance with us, then? No. Soph, what? Here, I had these printed out for you. Your poems. Well, this is great. Now I'll have something to read to the guys in the trenches at night. You used to like them. Well, they're good. I always liked the poet. I'm gonna miss you. You know, when we were kids, I was always terrified you were the guy I was going to have to marry. But you just couldn't control yourself, could you? 'Oh, Bob, oh, Bob, Bob, don't. 'Oh, Bob, don't stop whatever you do, 'Bob, don't!' 'Oh, Bob.' Larry, Sophie, come on, the fireworks are going to start! -Oh, can you hold this? -Sure. Thanks. Thanks, Gray. -Here, buddy. -Thank you. Oye! Is this Ambulance Field Headquarters? Chicago! I know people in Chicago. Jeez, you must be the guys from Chicago. Piedmont! Fresh meat! Fit them out, Malcolm. I'm Piedmont. I'm your leader. That's Malcolm. He's what's left of my followers. We put three heaps to a squad. There'll be you, some dog meat from Harvard and our rig when it gets ready. What the hell's the gun for? America's not in the war. Well, yes and no. We don't get to kill anybody, but they can kill us. There's a big push on tomorrow at Mons. We leave the minute this Harvard heap arrives. Mr. Piedmont, I presume? Doug Van Allen and Brian Ryan, Harvard, '17. You must be Chicago. Lake Forest, actually. -Doug Van Allen. -Larry Darrell. -Gray Maturin. -Brian Ryan. -How do you do? -Larry Darrell. No trouble clearing this off the boat train? None, sir. Isn't she beautiful? Swellegant. Hi, meat. That paint job's gonna make a great target. Not the way we drive. Doug and I did the six-mile course at Harvard in six and a half. Is that right? Huh, six and a half. Piedmont and I did it at Yale in six flat. Okay, for now, I'll ride with Darrell, Malcolm, you take Gray meat. -You two follow in Moby Dick. -Let's move! What is this foul stuff? Well, this definitely isn't chicken. Oh, it's chicken. Head, skin and feet. Hey, Chicago, why don't you finish this potted shrimp. You betcha. Thanks. -Shrimp? -Yes. Shrimp? God, what a car. Thanks, Piedmont. Goddamn it! Are you crazy? You can't have headlights. The heinies catch a flash of those headlights, you guys are dead meat. Goddamn it, you're drunk! Drunk? The liquor never even makes it to my brain, Dougie boy. You're educated men. Let's get this over with. You came over here for a little fun, a little excitement... and to help your fellow man. Well, you won't help anybody. And you know why? Because you can't even help yourselves. And after the first good mortar concussion, you'll be picking that wind shield right out of your face. So you might as well get rid of it right now. Piedmont, what are you doing? I am helping my fellow man. Gray, Darrell, come here! The hospital is eight kilometres. Don't stop for anything. No matter what happens, don't stop! Piedmont, there has got to be something else. You got a driver's license? License? Don't stop, Larry. What's he saying? Didn't they teach French in your college? I was a baseball major. -What does he want? -What does he want? He says his arm is shattered and it's pinned under the body of another guy who won't move, because he's already dead. He's sure he's dying and if you had the decency of half a human being, you'd do something for him! I don't know what he wants! Don't stop, Larry! All right, boys, everybody sing or we aim for the ruts! Oh, my God, I've been hit! -What are you doing? -Doug's been hit! Hey, Doug Van Allen's been hit. In his wrist. Well, Piedmont says not to stop. Darrell, Doug and I crewed together! Doug Van Allen and Brian Ryan, wasn't it? Jeez, what a couple of liars, huh? They loved to lie, those two. They enjoyed it. They never did any goddamn six miles in six and a half. Maybe you don't, but I hate liars. I hated those two when they told their little lies. They won't be missed. Green River at the sweetshop. The first thing I'm gonna have when we get home. Could be any day now too, now that Uncle Sam's in the war. You okay? It's getting light. Come on! -How are you? -I'm bad. We need help. -What now? -Now we wait. Uh-oh. Hey, Piedmont. Fire! Fire! -What was that? -Grenade. Horse shit. Okay, it was some woman's tee shot. Darrell, look out! Nice going, Piedmont. He was a slob. Did you ever see him eat? Starving children could fill their bellies on the food that ended up on his beard and clothes. Dogs would gather to watch him eat. I never understood gluttony. But I hate it. I hated that about you. He enjoyed disgusting people, being disgusting, the thrill of offending people and making them uncomfortable. He was despicable. He will not be missed. I'm very sorry. It was my fault. It was my fault, really. Now, let's try again. More champagne! Fine. Look out, here comes Frankie. What a generation. No, no, let them burn off some steam. The war heroes have earned it. But come next week, I'll work the two of those boys ragged at the office. Next week? It's the first I've heard of it. Larry's been so quiet about things since he got back. Hi. I think we need to talk. Larry, this has been going on for three weeks. Did it ever occur to you that I might be in training? Did it ever occur to you that you might be avoiding me? Okay, let's talk. No, Larry, you come out. Larry! Damn it! Okay, let's talk. Seal talk. Okay, let's talk. Thank you. We all believe in you, Larry. I mean Mother and myself and Mr. Maturin. And we all know that you've had some kind of a... well, shock over there, and that... Well, that you just needed time to kind of loaf around, as you put it. But, um... doesn't it seem that it's about time to get back on your feet again? Yeah. No. What? I wanna put off the wedding for a while. I wanna put off the job too. For a while anyway. I don't understand. In your letter, all you talked about was coming back and getting married and starting the job. I lied. I didn't know I was lying. But I guess I was. I see. I don't think I'm the guy you wanna marry right now. This isn't the old Mr. Sunshine. I'm not happy. I can't make myself happy. I couldn't make you happy. I just wanna think. I need to think. And I don't have much experience in that field. Think? Think about what? I don't know. Me, you, our lives. I'll tell you when I start thinking. So you want me and everyone else to just go on and on sitting here, waiting for you to figure out the meaning of life? Well, sort of, yeah. Well, that's just great. -Okay, well, -Yeah, you wait. We'll see. Bob? As long as he's on their team, we're bound to win. Bob? I'm sorry. I'm afraid we should leave now if you're gonna make it for work. Come on, hon. One more scrum. We're three goals behind. You can't take him from us now, Sophie. I've got a bet on with Gray. Oh, yes I can, Tyler. What are you making at that sweat box anyway? I'll buy them out for the night. Thanks anyway, Tyler, but I think you can manage without him. All right. We'll just have to play five on six, then. See you, Gray. See you, Bobby. Is everything all right, dear? Mom, there's been a change of plans. We're going to postpone the wedding just for a while. You're what? Now, don't start one of your things. It's just for a while. He wants to be by himself right now, so he's going to Paris. Paris. And if he needs a little time by himself, -I'm going to give him that. -Oh, Isabel, don't be so naive. It's just an excuse. It is not an excuse! He loves me. You know, if I may say so, Louisa, it makes perfect sense to me. All Americans should avail themselves of at least one season in Paris just prior to marriage. It curbs the itches which tend to rise a year or two down the connubial pike. Elliot, don't be vulgar. You know that's always been my problem. People think I'm being vulgar when I'm being serious and they think I'm being serious when I'm being vulgar. Then you'll take care of him for me, Uncle Elliot? Of course I will. I'll arrange his passage for him. You know, the people you meet on the ship often set the tone for the entire tour. I think the Mauretania for Larry. Yes. Yes, the Mauretania. He'll sit at the Captain's table and meet all the right people. Then he'll need a first-class hotel where he can entertain. I think a suite at The Georges V would be perfect. -Merci, bien. -Roland! Don't worry, we'll have your boyfriend back to you in no time. Well, hello. Welcome to Paris. Louisa, my dear, at last. Elliot. It's so good to see you. And here she is. -Hi, Uncle Elliot. -Oh. Welcome to my humble abode. Come in, my dear. -Oh, thank you. -How was your crossing? I read the journal, it was a little inclement. Well, it wasn't too good. Come along, Cinderella. Oh, Elliot. This is a palace. Why, thank you, I'm glad you like it. Oh, my God. This is my music room. Oh, isn't that lovely? Oh, what a beautiful piano. Well, it's a spinet by Larande, late 18th century French. -It must have cost a fortune. -It did. My poor dear friend, the viscount de Corvence had to part with it at a slight reduction, but then, estates are so draining on one these days, don't you find? And are all these things for sale? My dear Louisa, this isn't a shop. I occasionally allow the odd piece to be torn from my grasp. You've got that lovely picture of Mother. This room... I never dreamed anyone could ever live like this. Why, it's not difficult if you know what you want. This outfit looks really ridiculous, doesn't it? Especially over here. I'm such a mess. The dress is. We'll get you a new one. You yourself, are exquisite. You belong in a room like this. It and everything in it will be yours someday. I had hoped that you might grow up in this house. You're the only family I have. But your mother preferred to remain in the cow pastures of Illinois. Don't worry, I realize why you finally deigned to visit your old uncle. Larry's stayed here longer than you expected, hasn't he? Well, I assure you I did everything I promised you. I invited him to parties, he claimed, he didn't have a dinner jacket. I asked him to lunch, he said he didn't eat lunch. Elliot Templeton gets the message. Nice catch. Be careful, my dear. That one plate is worth more, than your young man has earned in a whole year. Hello, Mr. Templeton. Oh. Hello, Mrs. Bradley. Hello, Larry. I'm sorry that I'm late, but I had to pick up the band. I hope you'll forgive me. In case you get the chill. We cross the fingers. -Who are they? -They're from Les Halles. -I work with them in the stalls. -Oh. Work? I thought you came over here to think. Well, I did. But I learned too much. I'd read so many books, you could smell wood burning. So I took a job packing fish. Packing fish? Yeah, it's a good job. I like it. Well, that's great. I mean, that you like it. Is that what you're gonna tell Mr. Maturin when you see him? That you kept him waiting for six months because you like to pack fish? I'm not going back. I'm not going to be a stockbroker. Marry me. We can raise a family. We can travel. I have $3000. That is more than most people live on. Larry... we are not most people. We're special people. Iz, nobody is special. I'm special. And I am not gonna spend my whole life tagging along behind you, making both ends meet. Come on. No, Larry, come on, It's not fair. I've lived up to my half of the bargain, you haven't lived up to yours. I should just give this back to you. Don't give it back. Wear it on another finger. It will mean that there is one man somewhere who will always love you. What does that mean? Look, I got a second chance at life. I am not gonna waste it on a big house, a new car every year and a bunch of friends who want a big house and a new car every year! I can't turn back now. I want you to come with me. Would you like a chilled glass of Chablis? Yeah. So, what do you do when it's hot outside? Drink red. Did you read all these books? I skimmed them. To think I used to help you with your homework. Yeah, you got me through grade school. It wasn't that hard, really, you know. All you had to do was what they told you to do. Well, I'm doing my own thinking now. I want to speak with Isabel. But she's not here, Monsieur Larry. You're not doing butler stuff on me, are you? Isabel? Isabel? Isabel? Joseph. Isabel has gone. She and her mother have taken the boat train. Joseph, I appear to have been crashing about again without my spectacles. I'm really very, very sorry. Bob, hurry up, they're coming. Here, they're coming now. Goodbye. Thank you. You're a lucky man. Thank you. Shall we? Here. Be back in the office by Monday. Let's have a drink. Hello, Mary, Shirley. I wonder if we'll ever see him again. He'll come back, but he'll be a little late, won't he? I wonder if she'll still let Gray give him that job. Oh, God, Bob, Larry doesn't want that job. Ah! That's refreshing. Who do you think you're saving? Have a drink with me. What for? I owe you my life. My life's worth one drink. How about some cards? Well, I've watched you play. I think you must cheat. I've watched you read. You read funny books for a coal miner. Oh, yes, that! There's a god of light and a god of darkness. Heaven for good people and hell for bad ones. You believe that? I believe that you're saving nines. What else do you read? The Apocalypse, Essenes, Aristotle, Plato? What about Znachar, the Russian sorcerer? The Upanishads? You've never read the Upanishads? You don't know so much. You really don't know anything, do you? Lend me your copy. I never lend books to coal miners. They've got dirty hands. Have you been to India? What's in India? Hundreds of millions of people that pray three times a day. There are answers there. India's a lonely place. If I'd stayed... I never would have known this little one. Very good. I'm a good cheater. Here. The Upanishads. But you won't find the answers in a book. You'll have to go there. What about her husband and her son? They were killed instantly. A drunken driver. Head-on. Oh, Sophie. Izzy. Baby. I know. My baby's gone. Bob, he's gone. Oh, my God! At least, they didn't suffer. Get out of here. Izzy, get her out of here! Please, please. This is a sad time, Mrs. MacDonald. But it is also a day for rejoicing. Our Lord has promised to call us all home to him in heaven. And today he has called home your husband and child. You're like idiots. They're dead, you freak! They're dead! Dead! Get away from me with that thing! Are you gonna be here in a week when I wake up? In a month? In a year? For the rest of my life? Mrs. MacDonald, I know you're upset. What do you know? I had that baby inside of me! I had that man inside of me! You? You've never had anyone inside of you! -Please! -Oh, Izzy! No! -All right. -No! You'll have to leave. -Izzy, don't leave me! Don't go! -Please! -Izzy, don't leave me! -Oh! Sister! -No. -Sister, hold her. No! What happens now? No, Izzy, don't go! All right. All right, it's all right. Izzy! You need guide, sahib? No, my friend. Thank you. Here. More rupees. More rupees. How are you? More rupees. More rupees. Is this your sister? More rupees. -More rupees. -Here's two rupees. More rupees. Give one to your sister now. More rupees. Okay, there's five. Split them up, okay? Help me out here, pal! Come on! Come in here! Okay, thank you. I like it. I like it. I'll take it. Cigarette? No, thank you. You must find it pleasant to be rich. I'm not rich. Oh. I'm often mistaken. I worked in a coal mine to come over here. A coal mine? What was the intention? I told you, to make money to come over here. That was the reason. What was the intention? Because if work has no intention, it's not work at all. It's an empty motion. Well, what would you call washing dishes? For me, this is a religious experience. Hey, let me try that. Yeah, I feel it. Kind of like being in church. Pass me the soap, will you, bishop? Here. Thanks. I could take you to a better church. In the mountains. I've been there many times before to work. It's a difficult place to reach. It's a difficult place to work. Who washes the dishes up there? Could you leave at dawn? Want me to talk to your boss? Boss? I have no boss. I own this boat. And a few more. Ta-da! Uh-huh! Too much? Good. Smashing, in fact. What do you think, honey? Too much? Not enough? Is this gonna help? Is this gonna get me anything? What do you think? No? Well, gee, I know what this one here is. But, shouldn't this one be walking by now? I mean, did you ever think of giving it a cold shower or an aspirin or something? You know, I could do pretty well up here, I think. They see few Westerners up here. They see none where we are heading. Ah! Our guides! That's the church, Larry. Now, let's hurry. Must get back to my boats. I have been waiting for you. Welcome. You are welcome. Fabulous, fabulous, fabulous. Oh! Excuse me. Are you having a good time? Well, I thought I told you two it was time for bed. I'm sorry, Mrs. Maturin. It's all right, Barbara. I'll take them up. Come on, angel face. I hear you bond boys are losing a lot of your clients' money. Yeah. What does your old man think of that, Gray? Well, think what you like about my old man, Tyler. Believe me, I know how difficult he is to live with. But the fact is, he's a good man. A damn good man. Excuse me, sir. Telephone. They have their baths? They did. Yes. We'll tell a nice story. Hello. Yes. I'm telling you, there's 12% unemployment out there. Twelve percent. And we're really feeling it. I'm beginning to think Roosevelt's right. We got a hell of a depression on our hands. Gray! Did you see that? It was a nice service for your dad. Yeah, short and sweet. Yeah? Hey, nice tic you got there, Gray. Here. Have a shot. It'll go faster for a minute, and then it'll stop. -No, thanks. -No? Hey, look at that freak! Why didn't he jump in the grave with your dad? Oh, Sophie, please. Let's not fall apart, okay? Gee, Izzy... to tell you the truth, I fell apart a while ago. So, what did the Monsignor say? I told him that pop always kept a gun in his office... and he kept large amounts of cash. And while he was cleaning the gun, it... accidentally went off. Hey. Easy, Gray. You sound like you're starting to believe that. It is time to go. The lama is waiting for you. There is a hut in the mountain. The lama likes you to go there. I packed your books. I am sad... because I am losing my cook. Yes, I'm leaving. Isn't it true... It is easy to be a holy man on the top of a mountain? You are closer than you think. The path to salvation is narrow and as difficult to walk as a razor's edge. Good God, Romulus and Remus. Now, Joseph, you see, this is not fit for a gerbil. That, on the other hand, minus an outer leaf or two is positively Rousseauian in its beauty, and at half the price. Pay the man half what he asks you. Hello, boys. Good God, Darrell, I was under the impression that you'd vanished. You know that Isabel is here in Paris with me? This wretched Depression cleaned them out. Poor old Gray lost everything. Gray? Gray Maturin and Isabel? And they have two children. Gray hasn't worked for two-and-a-half years. Yeah, but I can see you're busy. Don't let me keep you. I'll give your best to everyone. Come, Joseph. Look, why don't you... take a wash and drop by sometime. Thank you. Would you tell your mother that Uncle Larry is here? -Yes. -Okay. Mama, Mama, Uncle Larry's here! Thanks, girls. You go out and play, all right? I was hoping that you might stop by. Well, I had to make sure the children didn't look too much like Gray. -Where is he? -He's upstairs. Honey? Larry. -Good to see you. -How you doing? I was downstairs this morning. Wish you'd caught me then. Got another one of my damn headaches. Sometimes they're so bad, I... I feel like I'm gonna die. Sometimes I wish I was dead. Gray, sometimes all of us wish you were dead. -What are you doing here? -Oh. I thought... This is guy talk. We're gonna talk about girls. We don't want you around. Bye. Bye. How are you doing? Not bad, for me. You haven't tried aspirin for these headaches, have you? Mm. Yeah. I've got something that might work. Here. Hold it in your hand. Clasp your fingers tightly around it. Hand out, palm down. No big deal. I'm gonna count to 10. And before I get to 10, you're gonna drop the coin. One, two... Three, four... Five, six... Seven, eight... How did you do that? I didn't do it. You did it. Here's what you're gonna do next. Hold the coin in your hand again. Gently, this time. Let your hand rest on your lap. Lie back. Relax. Relax your whole body. Your eyelids are gonna get heavy. They're going to close. You're going to sleep... for three minutes. And when you wake up... your headache will be gone. Where'd it go? God, it's good to see her smile again. It's good to have you back. It's good to have you back. Nice being here. Okay, now we go here. Oh, hey, go and tickle Uncle Larry like crazy. Oh, children, children, Monsieur Larry is not ticklish. Oh, you, traitor. Oh, mama. -No! -Your mommy's ticklish. Mama is very ticklish. Thank you, Joseph. There's a lot of energy in this place. I feel it. A little less than there was a minute ago. Oh, Larry. This is good. You're gonna like this. Sophie! Well, for chrissake. Sophie. Larry. God damn. I thought you were dead or something worse. What are you doing in Paris? You mean our old friends didn't tell you? Tch. I guess it must have slipped their minds. Been trying to call you lately. I even came around to the house the other night. But I guess it was a little late for you fun-seekers. How you've been, Sophie? Oh, I've been having a regular riot, Izzy. My loving in-laws ran me out of Chicago. They didn't care for my behaviour. Our old friends here don't care for my behaviour either. But, uh... That's okay! I got lots of new friends. How's Bob? Bob. Oh, Bob... Been having a regular riot too. Isn't he, Gray? There was an accident. Bob and Matthew were killed. Sophie's been under a lot of strain lately. I've been under a lot of strain? Have you looked in a mirror lately? Sophie? Will you excuse my little friend? Sometimes she smokes too much of the Chinaman's pipe. Perhaps you find her amusing? Would you like a private room upstairs? Forty francs. Twenty for her, twenty for the linen. How dare you! -Why don't you just get the hell out of here! -Excuse me. You see, we're old friends of Sophie's. Then for you, 30 francs. Okay, deal. For 30 minutes. Come on, Larry, don't kid with Coco. He doesn't have much of a sense of humour. Got a clock, Coco? In my head, Monsieur. Doesn't leave room for much else, does it? Gee, you're right. You just can't kid with Coco. Let's call it an evening. Okay? We'd like to go home, Joseph. Not so fast, you're our ride home. It occurred to me that I wouldn't have to pay for the linen at my place. Are you sure you both don't want to come back to our house? -No, we'll be fine. -Good night. Good night. Come on, let's run. You got to run. Where the... Here, here. Go ahead. Come on. Come on. Where the hell do you live anyway? This set of steps and one other. Hey, I didn't tell you about the incredible view that I have. You've never seen anything like it before. Larry, you don't know where I've been. Get up these stairs! Get up there. Come on, come on, come on! It's kind of a bachelor's place, but I'll go and straighten up. Are we there? Are we there yet? Almost. Bring that up for me, will you? Oh? Romance, romance, huh? Would you care to dance? Mm. You know... It's getting very hard to find an apartment that doesn't have hot water but I've found this fabulous landlord. That is refreshing, isn't it? Oh, you bastard! Larry? Larry. Oh, thanks. Big trouble. Landlord's making me paint the place. You're gonna have to help. -Paint? -Yeah. Oh, yeah, okay. I'll be back in about an hour. Who do you think you're talking to? Mr. Coco? 'I'll be back in an hour.' 'See you in sixty, Coke', huh? Larry, God damn it, I've got to go! What about last night, princess? Do you think that was for free? Phew. You're on the painting team, get it? You don't think I would give you your freedom if this painting thing hadn't come up? What do you think of white? Right. Pretty good. Would you like something to drink, Miss? Nothing? No. Merci. Yes or no? Yes or no? You're not gonna like this either, are you? You don't like this, do you? You don't like it, do you? Now, that I like. -You like exercise? -Aye. You're gonna love our place. Hey, honey. I thought I'd whip you up some lunch. Aren't I the thoughtful, domestic type? You smell nice. Squaw, fix dinner. -Okay. -Nice job on canoe. Just one thing, chief. That's wet paint you're sitting on. When Bob and the baby died, I... I went to such a black place. It was almost like... Like I felt I deserved it or something. I don't know why. And then I was trying to justify it somehow. Like, by proving to myself that I was a really bad person. I did deserve it. Jeez. You've given me so much, Larry. It's very easy to love someone like you. Yeah. Bonjour, Monsieur. Monsieur Templeton. I think we should have used the back door. We'll probably have to use it to get out. I think the market's doing very well. Darling, your hand is perspiring. -Larry. -You can drink if you want to. -Hi, Sophie. -Hi. Sophie, my dear, it's been far too long. Mr. Templeton, you haven't changed a bit. Well, you certainly have. I just mean that I don't recall you being such a fibber about an old man's looks. Cocktail, Mr. Templeton? No, thank you, Albert. I fear my drinking days are over. Surely, a tear of Zubrowka could do Monsieur no harm. Zubrowka! We used to drink it at the Radziwill's when I stayed there for a shooting. I don't suppose a drop will hurt me. Oh, we must all try some. Oh, not for me. Thanks. Oh, my dear, you must. No. Thanks anyway. Ah, the herbs. It's like newly mown lavender. Well, what shall we drink to? We could drink to Sophie's and my wedding. That's swell! Congratulations! Golly! Imagine that! When is the happy occasion? We're going to do it Friday. Friday? Oh, I think that's wonderful. I'd like to... take you to Molyneux's after lunch and pick out your dress. Gray and I would love to give it to you as a wedding present, wouldn't we, darling? Oh, you don't have to do that. Oh, don't be silly. I mean, after all, you two are our oldest friends. Well, I really don't think it's gonna be that kind of wedding where I'll need a new dress, right? -So thanks anyway. -Don't be stupid, Sophie! You've got to wear something! You can't wear that! Honey. Honey... Maybe Sophie doesn't want a new dress. Okay. That'll be nice. Good. We'll go after lunch. -Great. -Well... Cheers. Oh. Uncle Elliot, you were right. That's the best thing I've ever tasted. I don't mind simply looking at it. I'll have Albert order up a bottle for the house. You can take it with you. Albert, have them place a bottle of this ambrosia in my car, please. It's like listening to music by moonlight. Pretty nice place. Oh, thank you. Make yourself at home. I'm gonna check on the kids. It's really Uncle Elliot. He's been incredible. I don't know what we would have done without him. Afraid I rearranged your knick-knacks. You want to break anything else, Soph? Okay. Let's get this over with, huh? I know all you really want is Larry. That's ridiculous. I think it's actually quite fitting that you two found each other after all these years. Isabel, I know you're in love with him. You've always been in love with him. I wonder who else has always been in love with him. Hmm? And what if I am in love with him? And what if I can't see how in hell you're going to be able to stand by him when things get tough? How would you know? When he wanted you, you walked out on him. I walked out on him? Oh, no, I sacrificed myself for him. Oh, come on, honey. Honey. You sacrificed yourself for a mink-fucking-coat, and a set of monogrammed towels. I wanted to be a wife and I wanted children. Now, maybe that's something that you can't understand. That's not true, Isabel. Larry wanted to give you that. I was a good wife. I was a good mother. I'm gonna be one again. Bob got you pregnant. You made the best of the situation. Do you really think he was happy? Oh, Sophie. What can I say? I just do not believe that you will not drag him down eventually. You're drinking alone. I haven't... had a drink in three months. That's great. But you've wanted one, haven't you? Haven't you? And you will again and again. And again. What about the drugs? And what about everything else? Larry helps me. I know Larry helps you. Hello, oui. I can see him devoting the rest of his life to helping you. And never whispering one word of regret ever. Can't you? Telephone, Mrs. Maturin. Hello? Oh, yes. This is Mrs. Maturin. Mm-hmm. Oh, yes. Oh, that's wonderful. Mm-hmm. That was the children's dentist. There's been a cancellation. And I've been trying to get an appointment for weeks. Wait for me, please. Joseph will bring you some tea, and... And when I get back, we'll go. No. Maybe some other time, huh? No, Sophie. If you're going to get married, then... I'm going to buy you the dress. Yes, madam? Nothing. Come on, Sophie. Leave me alone. Can't you see? I'm listening to music by moonlight. Oh, Isabel. You were so right. She was right about everything, you know. -Let's go, Sophie. -Shh. Don't you hear the music? No, I guess not. All you ever hear are choirs of angels. Well... Coco here is my angel. Aren't you, Mon cheri? Don't you want to go home? Home? This is my home. I like it here. Right here in Coco's lap. It's the biggest... warmest... lap in town. Want to feel it? Why don't you just run along, Larry. We don't need you here. Nobody wants you here. We just... want to listen to music by moonlight. Larry! No! Larry! Monsieur Darrell, we are the police. Yeah, I noticed your shoes. We dragged her body from the river. Her throat was cut with a razor. What? Her throat was cut with a razor. It could have been any one of her friends. They are the vermin of the city. What was your relationship to the deceased? She was my fiancee. -Good, Larry's here. -Thank you, Your Grace. Elliot's had a stroke. The bishop just gave him the last rites. Isabel... Isabel's in pretty bad shape. Oh, Larry, he's going fast. And I don't want him to die sad. All his friends have forgotten him. He waited for weeks for an invitation to Princess Novemalli's party. I knew it wouldn't come. People think him a silly man, Larry, but... He's a good man. And a generous one. Excusez-moi. Oh. I'm gonna miss him so much. I wish I'd been a better friend to him. Like you were to Sophie? Is she okay? When I came back yesterday afternoon, she'd gone. What happened to your face? She's gone for good. What? She met up with some old friends, I guess. They got her drinking Zubrowka. One of them slit her throat and dropped her in the Seine. Oh, my God! I don't give a damn if they catch who killed her. What I want to know is how you got her to take the first drink. What'd you do, get her going on Bob and the baby? Did you get her down and keep her there? I broke this chair once. Because I couldn't spend the rest of my life with you. Sooner or later, she would have let you down. I wanted you to see that. I've never stopped thinking about you. I love you. I just wanted you to be happy. I didn't want anyone else to hurt you. So you killed my fiancee for me? Just like you killed my fiancee. I was in love with Larry Darrell, but you had to take him away to go and find the meaning of his god damn life. Honey... I'm afraid you'd better come. How you doing, Unc? Life is full of ironies, isn't it, Darrell? You know... I spent my whole life... among the great names of Europe. Now I'm dying... And who comes to see me but... Well, I mean... An itinerant... Fish packer? Fish packer. Oh, I got some mail for you. Huh? Some old buzzard came to the door while I was downstairs raiding your icebox. Who's Novemalli? 'Princess Novemalli.' 'Kindly requests the...' Costume party? Elliot! You're not gonna get out that old rabbit outfit of yours, are you? R.S.V.P. The princess's palace, I guess, Joe. Get your pad, Joseph. We must reply. Oh, not now, Uncle Elliot. My dear, I've always been a man of the world. And I see no reason to forget my manners now that I'm leaving it. Are you ready, Joseph? Oui, Monsieur. Monsieur Elliot Templeton, regrets he is unable to accept Princess Novemalli's kind... invitation. Due to a previous engagement with his... Blessed Lord. The old bitch. The children. When Piedmont died... I had to pay him back for my life. I found out there's another debt to pay, for the privilege of being alive. I thought Sophie, was my reward for trying to live a good life. There is no pay-off. Not now. Am I ever gonna see you again? Isabel... You just don't get it. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. Is she okay? She will be as soon as you go up. What happened, Larry? Isabel's gonna tell you. You know something? You two are the best friends I've ever had. Gray, that's just the luck of the draw. Oh, I tell you... -See you. -Yeah. Hey, pal, that's my coat. Don't worry, I'm leaving. Where are you going now, Larry? I'm going home. But where is your home, Larry? America.
