So, you do like him? Well, why else would I be here? A day with your big bro? You think I would trudge through this to spend quality time with you? No, actually, I don't. I guess I'm privileged today. Hey, thanks for setting this up, Bro. Yeah, I think Bob really likes you too. I mean, I don't know why. Sweet. You mean about Bob, huh? Jerk, I mean your attitude. Yeah, well, you're the pain in the butt and I get to play chaperone, so. You're leaving after an hour, you promised. Yeah, well, you know. Dick. Have you ever been in here without Mom and Dad? No, but who wants to be around them anyway? Mom's become a pain in the butt. Dad's off who knows where. I mean, does he even talk to you? He doesn't to me. All you do is argue with them anyways. And you don't? Emma, they have problems. Yeah, like you're an expert. I don't wanna move. Gee, like that's not obvious, right? When you turn 16 you'll see. Everything changes. Your friends actually mean something to you. Yeah, well, maybe but I still agree with Mom. We moved here for Dad and we should move back to New York for her. Dad doesn't pull his weight around here anyway. Dad's not made for the city. Yeah, well, Mom needs more of a challenge. Rescuing chipmunks or drunk frat brats, not her idea of being head of Emergency Response. They might divorce. I don't think so. Dad won't let that happen. He may be somewhere else right now but he's way to smart for that shit. It's not like Mom doesn't care. And how do you know? Hey, Mom does care. No, I mean about Dad being too smart. True, he did move us here and that wasn't really.. No, Emma, I'm serious. How do you know they're not gonna get a divorce? Hey! I'll knock you over the head with that. I don't know if I'm ready to do it. I'm not even sure if I can or want to. No. Send the separation papers off. Just sit on them for a few more days. Probably some cat. I'm sorry, I've got to go. Just send them, okay? Thank you. Hey, hey! Slow down! You know what Mom and Dad are always saying about rushing.. Hey, it's not my fault you're that slow. Trust me, Bob will wait. Yeah? And what about Christy? Think the two of them might? Those two together? Please, they're probably fighting right now. I mean, Christy's my girl, okay? Bob wouldn't and Christy, especially. Are you that trusting? Hey! You suck. You suck. I hope you brought some breath mints for you boyfriend. Ugh, funny. Wanna go, huh? Wanna go? Hey! Hey! You still wanna go, huh? Get the hell out of here. Oh, I hate this part. Aw, you want me to hold your hand like a baby? Oh, funny, I seem to remember you screaming like a girl first time we came here. Come on. Don't get stuck. Ian! Ow, that hurt! Don't touch me again! Why is the water warm? Weird. Kinda like you. Funny. Bob, Christy, where are you guys? We're late, yeah right. More like they're late. It's warmer than usual. What's that smell? I thought that was you. Ha! Funny. Oh, glow sticks, all right. Bob? Christy? Oh, isn't that so you, Ian? Bob, did Ian put you up to this? Ugh, I think I lost my cigarettes. Not that cool shit again. Okay, fine, you too. Play along. Bob and Christy are doing each other and I'm so freakin' jealous. You happy? Bob, this is my brother's thing. He's the idiot. I'm not gonna stay here if you're going to pretend to be like him, so please stop. Guys? My God, they're dead! Come on, Guys, even I don't think this is funny. Don't light that cigarette! Ian, no! What the hell are you doing?! The gas! We have to get out of here! Why'd you take me down? That hurt! Because I thought the gas might explode! What gas? Can't you smell it? Smells like sulfur. There's always been a little smell in the cave. Not that strong. If it wasn't gas, then what, what killed them? Are they dead? Yeah. What the hell? Let's get out of here. John, come check this out. I can't make heads or tails of this. I think we have an out of control campfire. Are you listening? John?! Sorry. What're we looking at? Oh, not New York again. Oh, not even close. When did you start smoking? I didn't, they're not mine. Emma. No. Your son. My son? My son, no, our son. When did Ian start smoking? I found these in the living room. They must've fallen out of his jacket. How can you be so sure they belong to my son and now your daughter? She's the rebel without a clue. Yeah, right, Emma. Miss Vegan. Okay, I'll talk to Ian. In the meantime, enjoy your lunch. Emma told me today that she'll never allow sushi in the house again. Now all three cams are kicking in. What? Looks like we have three small fires on three different ledges. This is from the cam on the eastern ridge. Campfires, right? No, it's too big for campfires. This was a few minutes ago. This is now. Lightening? Arson? There's no wind. It happened simultaneously. I better get out there. Oh, and I get to stay here. Derek's on vacation. Yeah but it's my decision. Well then make it. Hello? Mom? You gotta come and get us. We were in the mine, we found Bob and Christy. We just got there. They're dead. Mom? You gotta come and get us. Mom, they're really dead, we need you. We're at the mine. I think it was some kind of gas coming up from the pool in the mine. John? Yeah. Check the landline. It's dead. Okay, I'll grab the rescue gear while you lock up and I'll meet you at the car. John, get Derek here now. He's gonna have to deal with those fires. He's on his honeymoon, remember? Miami? And plus, no phones. Look, take the kids to my dad's house, okay? It's close, you'll be back in no time. Don't tell me what to do. Okay, fine, you're the boss but they're our kids. What would you like me to do? Find a way to call Sheriff Buckley. Close the center down until one of us gets back. We need to get communications back up. There's three fires burning, Lori. Without communications, I need to be out in the field. What about our children? Fine. You're the boss, okay? But without communication, I need to be out there and there's nothing I can do here. We'll talk about this when we get home. Fine. Here. Take this. You might need it. Be careful. I'll do some investigating of my own. Sheriff Buckley, this is John, can you hear me? (Muffled) Sheriff, you need to send a squad car up to Old Rocky. Lori's there with the kids. Seems like Emma and Ian found some of their friends there dead. We better stay put. Yeah. Some date. Some of your friends are dead and you're joking around? Hey. Remember when you used to call me "Squawker" just to tease me? Yeah, you'd add into anybody's conversation. Yeah. For awhile it was "Bubbles," right? You were "Burnt Toast." I don't remember that. Hey, you remember how we'd wrestle with Dad and Mom would get all worried because she would be afraid we'd get hurt? Yeah. And Dad would pin you down? You'd scream in French for help. I'd come to the rescue. Can you say it once, Ian? (French) I can't believe our friends are dead. Ian, Emma, where are you? Mom! We're over here! Oh, thank God. Mom, you have no idea how horrible it was. The most important thing is that you're safe. Bob and Christy are dead, Mom. I asked your dad to call the sheriff. You're both okay now, right? Okay? Where's Dad? We have three small forest fires. This time of year? Yes. I'm gonna have to go see what happened down there. You can't go in there, Mom. It's part of my job. Ash. Mom, Bob and Christy are dead. I know, sweetie. I'm taking you both to your grandfather's, now. But Mom! We need to get out of here, all right? No, Mom, I'm telling you. You need to check out that mine. Something really weird is going on down there. You need to figure out why Bob and Christy died. I'll do that later, Honey. For now, follow me to the car. But, Mom, I'm telling you. Into the care. That's a pretty good fire up on the east ridge. Dad, the kids are gonna be here in a couple minutes. Two of Ian's friends were killed last night in the mine. Cave in? No, Dad, something to do with the gas and these fires. I hope to God they're not connected. How could they be connected? John? Why aren't you at the center? Hey. Guys, we got a really big problem. Yeah but we didn't have anything to do with it, right? It has nothing to do with you. Dad, Ian just lost two friends today. Actually, this is about all of us. When are you gonna learn that I'm not a guy? Hey, come on, Sis. Okay, you two are with Grandpa. Great, just what we need. Oh, God, I forgot. When I get back, we're gonna talk about that. I'm glad you're okay. You two, Baby. Somebody needs to check out the mine. There's something really weird going on down there. I'm tell you. Okay, look, in the meantime, don't forget who's in charge at Grandpa's. Yeah, I am. Funny. Go save the world. So much for your kids! Take your truck. We can save some time getting back to the center by going on old 95 by the mine. You got 20 minutes. I wanna stop by the mine. There's something I want you to see by the bridge. Oh, John, we need to go, we need to do our jobs. Hot chocolate. More like Crystal Five. Feet. Hey, look at this. It's flat. Just like your chest. I'm gonna ask your dad something. Seems to be dead. How could the phone be dead? Maybe the fire knocked out a power line or something. That wouldn't affect the phone. Oh. They finally did it. They finally did it. They finally did it. Did what? They finally did it. They finally did it. Grandpa. The bomb. What? Nuclear bomb. What else could it be? There's a forest fire. It's a power outage. It's EMP. So where's the explosion? If was EMP, it would affect everything electronic, Grandpa. Like, do you have a watch with a battery? Or shaver? That's it, Ian, you're right. I'll check my shaver. I'm in hell. I've done nothing to deserve this. Current thoughts about Bob, maybe? What's EMP? Electric Magnetic Pulse. Grandpa's a loon. Yeah, well, he's a vet. I guess he has a right to be a loon. See? There's no bomb. Yay, whoopie. Oh yeah, that's right, we knew that already. So what is going on? I don't know but I wanna get out of here. Are you sure EMP effects everything electronic? Everything, okay, I'm positive. Unless the electronics are heavily shielded. Wind is from the east. What could cause this from the east? What are you talking about? I know, it could be a forest fire. You know, I used to be a Smoke Jumper. No. This ash fall's too heavy for any forest fire. Mom and Dad are out in that. Looks like ash. It is. What the? How can this be happening? It's a volcano. Lava without a volcano? We have to warn the town! This is part of something bigger. What the hell do you mean, something bigger? John? John? Lori, there hasn't been a volcanic event around here in millions of years. This is getting me really scared. It's time to be scared. What're we going to do? The shelter. Shelter? You wanna go out in that to get to town? No. We're not going to town. Where are we going? Nowhere. My car wouldn't last 10 minutes in this stuff. Great, so we're stuck here. Well where is this shelter? Are we walking? Listen, Young Lady. We don't know what's going on. It's my job to keep you safe. I was just asking a question. This could only be caused by a volcano. Mount St. Helens is a thousand miles away. Actually, it's two. Whatever, Mr. Geography. The wind is to the east and Helens is to the west. I know, then what? Grandpa? Like I said, a volcano. That again? Do you have another explanation? All I know is there are no volcanoes that are close enough to dump ash on us. Well, one is doing it right now, so where's this shelter? Follow me. And don't worry, I've seen worse. Let me guess, you have a secret bomb shelter. Never in a million years would I believe that you.. You could call it that. A bomb shelter? I could've used this when that 12th grader was gonna kick my butt last year, Grandpa. You actually have a bomb shelter. Hey, food. How old is this stuff? It's old, like me. I haven't been down here, I haven't restocked it since your grandmother died. I can't believe you just stopped here. We need to get back! In 15 minutes, I wanna see if there's a connection between the mine and the bridge, come on! Remember when we used to come up here? How pretty it was? Was? It still is pretty. Lori, when did this stop being pretty for you? I think this is about a lot more than just our town. Come on! How long do we have to stay here then? Till your parents get back. Listen, Emma, I know you think I'm crazy about the bomb and volcano theory. And as far as I know, I could be. Hey, that's not true. But what I do know is that as long as we're here, you're safe. We're safe. Now, let's hope that I'm wrong but what if I'm right? So this is our only choice? Yep. Ugh. Grandpa? Grandpa? Do you remember what a basalt eruption is? That's when lava erupts out of the ground from thousands of square miles at a time, yeah. Caused Permian Extinction of the dinosaurs. You think that's what's going on and you wanna get closer? Information saves lives. Smell like gas? Yeah, sulfur. You think it could've poisoned the kids? Volcanic gases can kill off an entire city. Or more. You think this could head towards the town? The batteries are dead. Do you have any upstairs? I think so. I'll go. No, we'll both go a little later. We're all gonna be dead a little later. Oh, Emma, try to be positive. This isn't an Old Maid deck, is it? No, it's just a regular deck. Anyone up for a game of Spades, Poker, anybody? Give me a break. I could play some Spades. How about you, Ian? Yeah, that would be great but we need another player, Grandpa. This can't be happening. You wanna play cards and our friends are dead! Emma. We'll be all right, Emma. We'll be safe. God, the air is so hot. Wait. My lead. Your lead. Damn it, I'm stuck! I win. Oh. I'm getting pretty tired. I know, it's weird, me too. Yeah. I wanna show you two something. What's that? What? It's a scrubber. A CO-2 scrubber to decontaminate the air. I wanna make sure that if we fall asleep we wake up again. You know, when that door is shut, it's almost an airtight seal. Could we run out of air? No, this is really just like a CO-2 filter. We don't have any power. We do have power. Those batteries are kept plugged in and topped up. That doesn't look that old. We used to have these chemical scrubbers. This is much safer. It's like what we used when I was in the service. I do know a thing or two about this stuff. Now it's safe to take a nap. I will keep you safe. They're here! Look. Volcanic glass. Two thousand miles above sea level, miles from the city, super heated water? How are we supposed to survive something that killed of 90 percent of life on this planet? By using our head. Come on. John, I can't breathe. Go. The air's not so bad here. Ugh, I'm stuck again. You're not at thin as when we met. Funny. John? John, hurry. My legs are beginning to burn. John?! John?! Hurry! Hurry! My legs are burning! Your parents, they're probably just lost or in a pickle somewhere and we're gonna have to get them out of it, so, I want my rest. So take a nap. Nothing else to do. Come on. Come on. The town! Oh my God! Ian and Emma. Lori, we gotta get out of here! Grandpa? Grandpa? Grandpa! Grandpa, wake up! Ian! Grandpa! Wake up! Grandpa! Ian! Grandpa! Wake up! Wake up! We've gotta get out of here. Grandpa. I've gotta protect. Ian. I've gotta protect you. Ian! Wake up! I need your help! Ian! Ian! Ian, Emma! He's not breathing! Hey, come here! Ian! Ian! Start CPR on Ian, I've got Emma! Hey! Hey! Hey! Take a deep breath. Damn it! Damn it! One, two, three, four. Grandpa? Okay, come on. Pop? I've got, I got you. I got you, come on. Come on. Okay, try to breathe. Try to breathe. I got you, try to breathe. We need to get them to the hospital or to a Hyperbaric Chamber! There's oxygen in the Emergency Center. Hospital's closer. Oxygen in the welling tanks. He's got oxygen in the welling tanks. Come on, come on, we gotta get out of here. I got you. Okay, okay. Come on, let's go. Dad, you're gonna be fine. Look, there's plenty in here. I rigged up the fish tank tubing from your fish tank. Just keep breathing that in. I still think we should go to the hospital. Treatment for CO-2 poisoning is oxygen, we have it here. Yes but I want a doctor to look at them and pressure with oxygen is preferable. Baby, there is no hospital. There's no town. There's just us. There must be some medical facility we can take them to. What if there's something wrong with them we don't know about? What about your dad? We'll take them to the center. We can deal with the CO-2 poisoning there, maybe check the outside world. See how widespread this lava storm is. We're going to the center now. Took them long enough. Lets go guys. Come on, Pop. Come on. What the?! Ian, get back! You better come look at this! Let's go! Let's go! We're lucky. 10 minutes out of town and it's a lot clearer around here. So how much longer? Soon. Why don't there any cars on the road? Where is everybody? I don't know. How're you feeling, Ian? Good. In fact, I think I'm pretty much back to abnormal. Good. Maybe you should continue smoking cigarettes then. Real funny, Dad. Real funny. Har, har, har. Dad, about the cigarettes. Later. I'm not a smoker, okay? Yeah. Just so you know, I plan on giving you hell, so be prepared. I guess it's easier when you both yell at me at the same time. I don't plan on yelling. I'm gonna use guilt, shame and humiliation to crush your will. I plan on screaming bloody murder. So be prepared. Oh my God. You know how lucky we are we weren't here earlier? I need to see what's left. What about us? Not this time. I've been trained for that kind of thing and I mean it! You heard your mom. You gonna give us the one "Under My Roof" speech because we probably don't have a roof left, Dad. Yeah, much less, a house. John, they're just giving you what you gave me. I'll stay with them, go. I'll go check. All right. What's the supply room look like? Same as here. What's the password? "Ian ampersand Emma." All caps. Okay, it's loading. Come on, come on, come on. Okay. Oh, great, great. It's telling us where exactly where we are. May I? Please. Ashes falling from Calgary to Germany. What's happening to all those people? The entire Earth's food chain is gonna collapse if this continues. Look. Lava's servicing just a few miles from here. No earthquake, no volcano, massive volcanic upwelling. This is a basalt eruption. Gaia has gotten angry. Thank God, the center of it is miles from us. What're we gonna do? I don't know. We gotta get out of here. Yeah, and go where, Lori? We need to find survivors as we evacuate. There's no communication with anybody. Pull up the satellite image of the event zone. Okay, we need to find some place safe to hide but where? Lava's gonna melt everything. What about the cavern? It's on the mountain top. The lava's running underneath it and if it continues to flow without rising. Al's Cavern. Access is through the mine but it actually is above Old Rocky. And as is enclosed. I'm so sorry, John. Sorry? I haven't treated you right, lately. Hey, hey, I love you. I'll take the good with the not-so-good. I could've lost you. No, you're not gonna get rid of me that easy. Now what? I'm zooming in. We're directly in its path. It's picking up speed. How long have you been standing there? Long enough to know that we're in deep. Everything the cloud touche if gonna pummel to dust. How do you know how to use that program? I taught her. Look, if we need to run and hide, wouldn't it be better to go towards water? Yeah, yeah, she's right. In Hawaii, the lava runs to the ocean and people aren't killed. What about bringing water to the lava? The dam. I'll go with you. How am I gonna take out the dam? We have an avalanche cannon. That so-called avalanche cannon is kinda small for a dam. Don't you have more than one shell? One would have to get pretty close to the dam to take it out. That person's probably not gonna survive either, so no, you're not gonna go. It'll probably flood the mine too. But Al's Cavern. Okay, okay, I'm gonna do that. You have got to get to the cavern as soon as you can. Oh, no way, not on your life. We're gonna get to the mine and we're gonna wait it out. We'll take all the equipment we can. Between you and I, we have a lot of survival training, we can't save the world. No, Baby, but maybe we can buy it some time. All right, Dad! Knock it off! Hey, Mom, you're ruining the whole "Happy Family" thing, again. All right, you know what, Emma? Why don't you guys go wait in the truck, okay? Come on! Come on! What? Please! Now! I'm getting tired of them bossing us around. What is wrong with you? There is no way you're sacrificing yourself! I only said that for Ian's sake. I don't want him to go with me but I'll be fine. Don't worry about me. No, I don't believe you. Baby, we're facing extinction here. There's no way I'm gonna let any of us die. I gotta do something. Are you all right? It's not us, it's Grandpa. Come on, Pop. It was a lava ball! Sit down. Hurricane. Eye of the hurricane. Come on, Pop. Thank you. What're you doing? We can't leave him here. I can't take him with me, I need the truck. You got the kids. Okay, Ian, Emma, you're with me. So where's Dad going? Why is he leaving us? I thought everything was okay with you guys. Why are you pushing him away again? Don't you dare say that! I am not pushing him away! Well you're not making him stay. I can't believe you. What if he never comes back, huh? Dad? Look, I gotta talk to you. You gotta stay here with your mom, take care of the family. No, I'm going with you. No, no way you're going with me. Dad, I can help! I know my way around the woods! Yeah, great. Meantime, you're gonna stay here with your mom, all right? You're pushing me away! Hey! That's cheap! Don't do that to me! I'm a man! No, you're a boy, okay?! You're not gonna manipulate your way into coming with me. I'm your father, you're gonna listen to me! Real good, Dad, real good. Now you're my father? Now we're some big happy family? Great timing. It's just, the whole world's crashing down. Ian, what do you want me to do? Ian?! What?! You know, this is no longer about just us. Yeah, it is. As much as I don't like it, your father's right. Bullshit. Emma, you're gonna need to be stronger. No, what I need is for my father to be alive. God, you know, I was hoping to drive Dad crazy with boys and, you know, nevermind, I guess we're all gonna die before any of that happens. Under these circumstance, I don't wanna leave with you and I on these terms, okay? Look, I don't plan on committing suicide, Ian. Your evacuation isn't gonna be too safe either. Ian, I need you to grow up and grow up fast. Piss off! Wow. I see you did as well as I did. What the hell just happened? I don't know but I think I'll stick to yelling. It's like they're punishing us or something and we don't have the time for that right now. Who's in control here? So you think we punished them enough? I don't know. Let's go back. The whole world's falling apart. This is starting to get scary. So are we gonna change the world or what? Come on, Mom, what's the plan of action? We do need a plan. Okay. John, Ian, go get the avalanche cannon and the ammunition out of the storage hanger. Emma, you're with me. We're gonna check on Grandpa and grab the satellite computer. It's a real joy to enter the new era with this family. Let's go. Move it! Come on! Woo. So, you have used one of these before, right? No. You? Well, I didn't know you were smoking cigarettes. For all I know, you could've fired one of these. I was just coming to get you. Did you know there's a plumes cloud barrelling down on us as apposed to an ash cloud? Yes, Dad, we know. How are you feeling? Well, strong enough to know that I've gotta get you all the hell out of here. Mom's formulating a plan, Grandpa. I have to get you and the kids to safety while John blows up a damn. Oh, is that all? Dad, do you feel strong enough to go check out the garage? See if there's a vehicle we could use? I'm on it, Captain. John? Here. You might need this. John, I don't want you to go. We're gonna stick to the plan. It's the best thing to do. It's not gonna be a picnic around here anymore. It never was. That's enough out of you. We need you. Baby, you got me. We gotta concentrate on saving everybody else now. I'm going with you, Dad. No you're not. I'd rather die with the man I respect most then run from something I can't even control. Isn't that the right thing to do? Yeah, yeah it is. No. You can come. No. I couldn't live with myself if I sent my son off to die. Mom, it's not your decision and it's not Dad's either. It's mine. Jesus. Get down! Mom's hurt! Everybody else okay? Yeah, we're all okay here. Dad! Come on, we gotta move! Can you stand? Hell yes. I got one of the emergency trucks started. Dad. I guess I'm driving. Dad, that's not a good idea.. I'm driving. Dad, that's not a good.. I'll drive! Guess we don't have a choice. All right, well, there's oxygen and heat suits in the car. Well the good news is you're not gonna die from your wound. Come on, we gotta go. I gotta tell you something about the dam. What about it? If you blow the damn, the bottom of the mine is gonna flood. You gotta give us a couple hours before you blow it up. And you may or may not be able to get in the mine. I know. I know. See you, Bubbles. Hey, I'm holding you to that. Take care, Burnt Toast. Bring Dad back. I will. We'll be in Al's Cavern. You better show up. Oh, you know me well. Look, you just get there as quick as you can. Dad, you take care of my girls. Come here, Baby. I love you. Okay, come on. I lived in a cave for awhile when I was serving my country. That experience may come in handy. I don't wanna go in the sauna. We wouldn't survive the heat. This one will lead us directly into Al's Cavern. And the only way into Al's Cavern is through this condemned tunnel? It's all we've got. Can't we just stay here in the mine shaft? No, Emma. We're above and the lava travels below. We have no other choice. I just wish everything would be back to normal. This is the new normal. Prom's gone, graduation's gone. It's all gone. You have to help me now, Emma. You have to think beyond yourself. I trust the tunnel gets a little wider. Actually, Mike, it gets narrower. I'm gonna go in and see if it's safe. I'll be back. It's a blaster. You have one, I have one. If you need me, press. Right here. We're gonna have to wait here for awhile. Keep your mom, gramps and Emma time to get into the cavern. You okay, Grandpa? Yeah. Yeah, I'm okay. Oh no. No, not again. No. Emma! Emma, you know your mom loves you. Yeah. She's taking a really long time. Emma! Grandpa! Grandpa, Mom's in trouble. No, I'll go. What if you get stuck? I've been in worse. No but what if you get stuck here and now? You'll have to figure something out. I tell you, I'm older, I've got more experience and I'm pulling rank. So I'm telling you now, I'm going into this tube into hell. Oh boy. We may have a little problem. What's that? You don't know how to use the avalanche cannon, do you? Come on, we'll figure it out. Well you think you can at least hit the damn? We'll find out. Got four shells, right? Don't you ever do avalanche control? No, I don't, okay? It's not part of my job description. Dad? What? Look. No. They need more time. We don't have more time. Give me a shell. Nothing! We need to get a lot closer. Come on, grab the shells. Lori, can you hear me? Oh, Mike. Hold on. I'm stuck. I'll try and pull you, all right? Okay. You ready? Okay, you're not moving. Maybe, maybe if I pushed you. Yes. All right? Yeah. Can you go forward? No. You're suit's tied up on a rock. Can you get out of it somehow? I can try. I can't zip it out enough. Cut it off. Maybe there's a rock or something sharp up there. Is there anything in here that you could use? Damn! Emma's panicking. Lori. Emma. Grandpa? Mom, I'm coming after you. All right, all right. All right. Wait. You all right? Yeah. Okay. Mom? Mom! Mom! Mom, please say something. It's so hot. Emma! Grandpa. Her suit is tied up on the rock. Get the knife from the pack. I'm so scared, Grandpa. You can do it. This is the moment you have to do it. Okay. Come on, we're out of time. Come on, give me a crack at it. I have the knife! Okay. Thank you, Emma. Okay. I am not a little girl anymore. It's too hot. The air's bad. Let's get out of here. Come on, Son. I know you can do it, Dad. Yes! Yes, Dad! Yes! The air's not too bad in here. I hope it'll hold up here. We have to get out of here. They just blew the dam. But not through there. Follow me. Grab the packs. John and Ian did what they said they'd do. I'm sure they took out the damn. Ian! Ian! Dad!
