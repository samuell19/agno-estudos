He was a guy that-- he was a bargain hunter, that he wanted to always bypass the dealers and start doing business with the artists directly. - I'm--I think it would do some good, Leo. I think it's going to be-- - Yes, sure. - He was a rainmaker in the art world, in that sense, where people that respected him decided that if he liked something, it was worth liking.

I just couldn't believe this. I mean, it was, uh-- the idea that art was being put on the auction block like a piece of meat. It was just extraordinary to me. I mean, this auction had very high prices for the first time for contemporary art. And I remember that Rauschenberg was there. Uh, and he, uh-- he was really incensed, because the artists got nothing out of this. The artists got the $600 they were paid in the first place. It was totally p-- totally, totally, totally pivotal moment. Suddenly there was the realization because of the prices that these works of art by living artists got that you could make money by buying low and selling high. [Stephen Emil Dudas and Mark G.

He starts talking to me like, "Well, you know, you have to have-- everything has to be new." Like, you know, like, when they have cereal, they don't change the cereal. They just put "new" on it. So this is the new. And it foreshadows a lot of the whole thing about branding and what people attribute to Andy Warhol. Jeff knew all of that just by instinct. - And he probably would have created... - Around '79, '80, all these people would say to me, "Hey, have you met Jeff Koons? You've gotta meet Jeff Koons. He works on Wall Street." Of course, Jeff was working in a bucket shop, like, out of "The Wolf of Wall Street." So someone told me the story that one of the legends of Wall Street comes in one day, and all the salesmen are enthralled. You know, "You're amazing." And this guy says, "You think I'm good?

They were just in awe. They'd never seen this before. - How'd you fucking do that? - This natural American salesmanship infuses everything he does. - You know, the first time we were asked to, um, to guarantee a Jeff Koons work, they said, "Well, you know, it's an addition of four with an artist proof." And I said, "What do you mean? There are five of these things?" And surely that should reduce the value of this work of art. But, in fact, it's completely the opposite.

You know, and a steam engine came to mind, that I would have a large crane, and then hanging from the crane, uh, I'd have a big steam engine. And when a train functions, there are pistons there. So every time it comes in, it's like a human being. It's a metaphor. [inhales sharply] [exhales sharply] [breathing sharply] So it's what we do. It's breathing. But each time, it's a puff of steam. [puffing] [breathing sharply] And it would follow this bell curve and eventually be going faster and faster and faster. [mimics train whistle] - What would it cost to do? - Uh, I mean, I think that I can make it anywhere between 25 to 50 million. - Hm. - But, uh, it's just power and excitement.

Fundamentally, the underlying opportunity here is that there's just a lot of really very wealthy people, and they have a lot of capital to deploy. - Well, I think it's definitely a robust market. Definitely tremendous depth of bidding, particularly for masterpieces, for contemporary works of art. This is a very attractive asset class. - Are you getting good stuff to sell? - Yes, we're starting to see artists who have very little depth of trading, very little traction, selling for enormous prices if there's confidence in that artist's work. ♪ ♪ - It's totally amazing.

I mean, I think the gallery's nervous. They're concerned because there's 12 people who want it. And once you're playing with sharks, it's just--it's a whole different ballgame. You know what they say about sharks? They have to keep moving, or they die, right? And I'm not gonna play that game. 'Cause I don't want to really be a part of the kind of jerk who, like, goes so high and kind of outprices the artist and contributes potentially to a crash-and-burn situation for that artist.

[applause] - Hmm. [exhales, soft laugh] "DROWN" was sold at a show from a few years ago, and the person who bought it resold it. - They brought it to auction? - They brought it to auction. Um-- - They flipped it, basically. - Yeah. - Is that-- That's what happened? - That's what happened. - I see. - Yeah. - You, so-- - [laughs] - So a flipper bought it. - A flipper bought it. When I'm just thinking of what success means for me... - Yes, yes? - I'm very interested in the long term. Um, so it's not about making a lot of money in the next five years and buying a beautiful house in LA, although that would be good, but that's not my driving force. I'm very--because it's-- I keep thinking long term, long term, long term. Um, what matters in the long term? The institutions you get into, the shows you get into. - So you want your work in museums? - Yeah, museums are, for a lack of a better word, the gatekeepers of culture, to some extent. I mean, you walk into-- once you cross that threshold of the door, you're walking in, and in your mind, you're thinking, "These are works that matter." Not just for our generation, but for future generations. So maybe things happen and I fall out of favor in a number of years. It'll go into storage. But someday, maybe in 50 years, maybe in 70, maybe in 150, it could come out. It doesn't just vanish. [soft music] - Now to a landmark donation for the Art Institute of Chicago. The museum says it's the largest gift in its history. 42 iconic pieces of contemporary art. It's estimated to be worth about $400 million. The gift includes nine works by Andy Warhol, including "Twelve Jackies," "Flowers," and "Liz #3." The President of the Art Institute said in a statement, "We are so grateful to Stefan and Gael "for the extraordinary gift.

[loud beep] [beeping] - You have to come close to see the glitter. There's glitter in there. - You've given this incredible gift to the museum. Why? - Well, the simple answer is no grandkids. We had had conversations with the museum, and I said, "You know, I'm gonna give you a picture, and it's gonna end up in storage. That's not good enough." So they said, "We're gonna clean our existing gallery, "and it'll stay up like you want for 25 years "in the gallery, and another 25 years mixed up, but still up." - Seeing it here today, do you miss it at home? - All our walls are full. [both laughing] No more room at the inn. - No, it's nice to see it-- - No, we'll make sure that we don't miss it. If we really miss it, we can come down and have another look. - Now, tell me about the Liz. - That's the only partial gift. Well, I gave the Liz at 10% because I just got it. I'd like to live with it. You can have it for six months, I'll have it for the rest. Meanwhile, get me a poster, get me something. And then Gael came back with an exact copy, including the wrinkles in the canvas. [laughs] So we're happy with the copy. Let them have the real stuff. It's amazing what technology can do now. - Doesn't this raise a little bit of a question, though, too, about even, what is-- what is a piece of art if it is reproducible like that? - You're--absolutely, you put your finger in the wound. That's it. What is a piece of art? Absolu--that's a question. I can't answer it, but I will-- I certainly agree with you. ♪ ♪ Looks good there, doesn't it? Makes you feel like you've done something.

Except you. Not you. The collective you. So you can hate us. Everybody should make fun of the art world. Is it absurd? Yes. Is it necessary? Probably no more necessary than religion, I would argue. You need to eat. You need not to be killed. You need to have some measure of freedom. So I'm not here to tell you art matters more than freedom, but I am here to say that art is part of being alive as much as Mozart is.
