A child in arms. - The peoples party will retain power, we should join them. - Whatever we do, we look like falling between two stools. - Is a very devil, I say. - You don't seem to see quite clearly, what you should do and in this unusual situation. Arrest me, then you are safe, whoever comes out on top. - In the name of the Duchess and of the constitution, I arrest your Jew. - I confess to having been a loyal servant to my master. I lead you the Head of the State, according to the very constitution to which you gentlemen, are professing, such an ardent loyalty. If that is treason, then gentlemen, I am being tried by time. - Stop quibbling, Jew. You can't escape a ride to hell in a gallows scott, better save your time and hours by giving us a good respectable confession. - You put it so charmingly, that you almost tempt me to confess to things, I haven't done, after all, you can't hang me higher than the gallows. Can you? - In law we have no case. I warned you on this from the beginning. You have no chance of me hanging him on any of the charges. - Oh yes, I have. - The precedent that lord's forgotten out of date. It has not been in foster for 200 years. - Still on the statute book, and I can think of no man, to whom it should be more applicable than Suss. Have you had carnal relations with christian women? - I had no idea, that was facing the court of Morgans. But if the court requires a complete list, of all my transgressions, since I arrived at manhood, together with the ladies names and their addresses, I can only refuse. - You've heard the prisoners own admission, under article 47 of the penal court. It is clearly laid down, that a Jew who has relations with a christian woman, should suffer death. - Gentlemen, if you wish to condemn me today on this score, I admit you can do. The entire holy home and empire, will laugh, but not at me. - Please, Highness. (clearing throat) - My son-in-law Karl Alexander was a fool, I always realized that, but you are not. So, shall we say for my daughter's sake, I have decided to help you regain your freedom. - Highness of my own free will like change my palace for this cell. Obviously, then I must have it good reasons for such an exchange, Your Highness mean and messy. - Suss, don't be (indistinct) fool, what you up to? To die for (indistinct),to (indistinct) after. (indistinct) of nowadays it's just not that, I have arranged everything, but it's just one very small condition I have to make, but it will cost you a minimum of inconvenience, merely that you become a Christian. (laughs) - Once before in my life Highness, I must face to this problem. I went for guidance to the only person I thought could help me, but that person was not there, on that moment I knew my problem, it ceased to exist. To her I had always been a Jew, therefore the Jewish shall remain. Your Highness, need mercy. (floor pattering) (door open) - But am I not the mother of the reigning Duke? - Certainly Your Highness. But when the reigning Duke has infinite arms, the constitution lays down, the country shall be governed by a region, by the vote of the council. I am appointed region during your child's modality. - Laws sounds very stupid and complicated. I really don't understand it. I wish the Jews here to advise me. - That is quite impossible Highness, the counselor are waiting your attendance, to sign the process for these tests? I've already had General Minchen. - I'm (indistinct) sorry to hear that. I never did care for that man, compared with the Jew with positive vow. You can't leave that there like that, looks like a piece of string. I don't want him here, Why can't he work for me as he did to my husband. - That Highness, is quite impossible. There'll be a revolution in the country within 24 hours. - Well, it's your affair not mine you're the (indistinct). No, (indistinct), you stuck that pin right into my head, all the same it's a nuisance without him. I still miss the Jew. He was such an amusing man, and very loyal poor Karl. (buzzing sound) (crowd chattering) (coughing) - The first snow. - Some wine Joseph, sweet wine from Palestine. - It will be piling up, over (indistinct). - This is always good for next year, blooming. (coughing) - Yes, I remember how it snowed when Leah died. I had never seen a grave before, I dreaded it. I always imagined it as a cool, ugly gash, of the greedy earth, like the snow, had turns it into a listening, white hollow, so soft, so kindly, that all my fear left me and I was at peace. Then when I came home, it wasn't little like bundle the giant, Naomi. (door opens) - Bring along. (floor pattering) (group chattering) (crowd shouting) (truckling sound) - No, we shall see if we can't hang you with higher, than the gallow. (crowd shouting) (truckling sound) (crowd shouting) - (indistinct) (crowd shouting) (crowd singing) (orchestral music) (speaking in foreign language) (orchestral music) (speaking foreign language) (crowd foreign language) (crowd shouting) (orchestral music)
