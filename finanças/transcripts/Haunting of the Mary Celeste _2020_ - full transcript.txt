Jenny. Told you this was gonna happen if you hire an intern outside of the department. You told her what time we had to leave, right? I told her, but, you know, she's probably hung over. She went out last night to a bar, um, called "Leelu's," or "Lanos," or... Or a "Leao," Grant. But it's nice to know you're tracking my movements. Good morning. Um, I told you 7:15, right? It's 7:30, and here I am. - What does this do? - Don't touch it. - I just said... - Why don't you guys go get some breakfast on the way to the marina? You go, too, Grant. I got this stuff. - Really? - Thanks. Yeah. Okay. Uh... See you in, like, 20 minutes? - Yeah, I will see you there. - Okay. Uh... good luck. - You're late. - Hi. Yeah. Sorry, but I did stop at this amazing antique store and I got this beautiful map of the Azores. But we're so ahead of schedule, I mean, this guy's boat is really fast, so... It goes, like, 35 knots on a good day. So I've been giving this a lot of thought, Rachel. And I really think that the university is falling over themselves to kiss your ass. Sounds like someone I know. Um... I got you something. Here. It's St. Anthony. He's the patron saint of lost things and missing persons. - He's from Padua really... - You don't actually believe this stuff, do you? ...but he was raised in Lisbon. No, I mean... Come on, it's like a good luck thing. Let's not get ahead of ourselves, all right? Let's get out there, gather our data, and bring it home to analyze, yeah? Yeah, of course. It's what I was gonna do. Great. It's so endearing when you try. - Is it? - No. On the Mary's most previous voyages, they were shipping copious amounts of coal. Now the remnants of that coal - combined with the fact that they just... - Grant. Oh, my God. Son of a bitch! It's supposed to be right here. You're looking for Nunes? Yeah, we are. He took off earlier this morning. Well, is he coming back? I don't know. God damn it! Hey, I'm still gonna get credit, right? How was I supposed to know the guy was skittish? You're supposed to know everything. Know any other boats for hire? If you're looking for a sightseeing tours, you're on the wrong part of the island. Ponta Delgada would be your best bet. I need to leave within the hour. - What's your rush? - So you do know of somebody. Hola, Miguel. Uh, no. I'm restoring her myself. - She'll get you where you need to go. - Really? 'Cause, I mean, what's her top speed? - 'Cause we need to go at least... - Grant. Good luck to you then. Seriously? Right now? He was rude. Well, I'm not getting in people's way. I don't need a headache like that. There. Hi. Look, I'm really sorry. Look, Grant didn't mean it. He's just... He's not the most eloquent guy in the world. Yeah, well... So where in the States are you from? You wouldn't know it. Look, I need a boat. It's a time issue at this point, and if you help me out, I will make it worth your while. It's quite a hefty bag you're carrying there, Miss. - Simmons. But... - Simmons. Call me Rachel. It's just camera and sound equipment. It's nothing too heavy. I'm here on research. Grant and Cassandra are my assistants. Field trip? Something like that, yeah. So why was Nunes so spooked? Was he? Whatever you're paying, I'm not about to risk my vessel. So level with me, or go home. Fair enough. Are you familiar with the story of the Mary Celeste? Okay, you think you are, but listen to this. You know, she was an American vessel en route to Genoa about 140 years ago. Now, the last entry we have on the captain's log was on 25th of November. And it put him right here, 36 degrees North by 25 degrees West. This... is Captain Benjamin Briggs. This is his wife, Sarah... and their daughter, Sophia. Now, there were no signs of a struggle on board. All the other ships in the area reported smooth sailing. And Briggs was an experienced seaman. He thought he had nothing to worry about. But all of these people... It's the most famous missing persons case in maritime history, and not one theory has held up. A storm swept all aboard into the ocean, a Victorian era insurance scam, fucking alien abduction, I have been over all of it. And you need a boat for what? To get a look at the area, and take some readings. Atmospheric changes, temperature, - any kind of electromagnetic anomalies. - Mmm-hmm. Look... I'm not some crackpot with a website and too much time on my hands. This is real science. And if you help me out, you could be part of a major discovery. Miss Simmons, I'm only interested in two things. The safety of my passengers, and the safety of my vessel. Can I interest you in a third? Hey. Hand me the case. Okay. Oh. Hello. Aldo, pull the ropes. Don't worry about this. We'll start working on it on the way out. Come on. He don't speak English and I don't speak Farsi, but it works for us. Shit! Excuse me. Sorry, man. Just... Um... Look, most of this stuff, most people don't know, was actually on the Mary Celeste. What's your theory? Huh? About the Mary Celeste. You said everybody's got one. What's your theory? Do you really wanna hear it? Okay. I'll be right back. All right. Okay. Watch... this. Look. What was that? Eight fishermen saw that bird disappear. I think that there are places on this planet where every once in a while, there's a tear, or a rift that happens when the tectonic plates shift, and there's a vent... All right, you've shot a gun, right? When you shoot a gun, there's a vacuum effect that gets created when the bullet leaves the chamber. It's called blow back. All right? That's how they trace DNA back from a crime scene. So? So, that blow back pulls trace amounts of material from the environment back inside the barrel. I think that that's what happened to everyone on the Mary Celeste. Just... stay with me. All right. The Azores are on top of one of the most active fault lines on the planet. When those tectonic plates shift, it's like a gunshot and the bullet is the pressure that's released. It's catastrophic, the climate changes, the tides shift, the magnetic belts are in flux, and a rift will feed off of that energy. The rift, in this case, is our blow back. Everyone onboard the Mary Celeste got pulled into one of those rifts. Now, I've been charting it. Tonight, finally, I know that it's... Miss Simmons. All right, you know what? This isn't the only time that it's happened. Five years ago, the Kaz II was found drifting off the coast of Australia... Jesus! - October 1917... - Miss Simmons! Jesus! Do you believe me? If I did I'd be turning the boat around. I should go back downstairs. Ten... Nine... Eight... Seven... Six... Five... Four... Three... Two... One. Here it comes! Fine. Hey. Are you all right? Yeah. What happened? Why'd we stop? Settle down, we're checking on the problem. They don't know. Aldo and I rebuilt these engines ourselves. I'm sure it's nothing. Do you want me to take a look? I mean, I know little... Oil pressure looks right. Tulls, you told me she'd get me where I needed to go. Where do you think you are? Shit. Start setting up. Come on. Marianna, this is the Allegro. We just lost both engines. Wait, wait. What are you doing? I can't have passengers on board when we've lost both engines. But he's working on it. He said it was nothing. You got an hour. I need more time than that. I could lose my license if I don't call this in. I've never heard of that. Nobody needs to find out. They'll drop you at Ponta Delgada. You can hire another vessel there and come back tomorrow. Tomorrow's too late. All of the data points to a shift tonight. - I'll pay you another 500. - Rachel! - Three thousand. - Whoa! - Are you crazy? - One thousand. Two. Now this is where you say 1,500. Done. Marianna, cancel that. Looks like we found a solution. You've got till dawn. Come on. Don't give me that look. That was bullshit. Stay focused, get those cameras set up, all right? Got it? Looks like we're not drifting too much. As long as the current doesn't pick up, we should be fine for the next couple of hours. Great. Hey, Rachel? Something's gonna happen tonight. I can feel it. Me too. Infrared's up. Whoa... guys. Here. I like it, man. It's cool. How do you live out here, man? I couldn't do it. It's too fucking quiet, you know. Hi. I'm, uh, measuring the changes in... electro-magnetic atmosphere. Usually in one of these rifts there's physical change that happens. You don't care, do you? You ever been in one of these rifts? Uh, no. How the hell do you know what happens then? Captain Tulls, I... I don't expect you to believe any of this. You know, I didn't at first either. And now? I believe in science. It happens. Yeah. Hello. Did you find anything? Not yet. Oh... Did you get something? Stop. Look, please, make yourself useful, okay? Just... You know what this is? This looks like a bullshit-o-meter. No. If the wand moves, tell me. - Okay. Yes, sir. - Okay, that's all you have to do. Please, just try not to break it, okay? - Yes, sir. - Thank you. Thank you. Jesus. Grant, did you hear that? Grant? Aldo. Aldo? Oh, shit! Hey! Somebody help me. Come on, give me a hand. - Come on - RACHEL: Watch his head. Careful. - Grab the first aid kit. - Okay, where's it? - It's up there in the wheelhouse. - Where? Wheelhouse. Right there! Right there! Aldo, Aldo! I got it. - Here. - Shit. Shit. Fuck. We're going home. Move, move. - Wait, what? - We're getting out of here. Tulls... No, we can't! Fuck me. Can we just stop for a moment and think rationally? Let's have a clear head about this, okay? Tulls, Aldo is going to be fine. Will you just, please... - What are you doing? - What the hell do you think? The engines are dead. - I thought the engines were already dead. - Damn it! - What the fuck is going on? - Why are you trying to start her? Come on. Come on, help me move these boards. No. No! No, Grant, no! We're not doing anything. No, damn it! - Come on, come on, come on! - Tulls... - Damn it. - Tulls, what is going on here? He's ripping you off, Rachel. - The engines are fine. - Jesus Christ. You think I cut the oil line? Move, move. He's a fucking scam artist. You do not know who the hell you are talking to. Keep your damn mouth shut. Come on, come on. Come on! All right, you know what? We're wasting time. Let's go. Mayday, Mayday, Mayday. This is the Allegro. We've lost all engines. Mayday, Mayday... Damn it. I got the sound equipment. Really? He's nuts, Rachel. You got an injured guy there, and you wanna break out the sound equipment? We gotta do what we can before the rescue boat gets here. Something is happening, and I'm not about to miss it... He is scamming you. What happens when the money runs out, Rachel? What is he gonna take next? You don't know what can happen out here. We can all disappear real fucking fast. All right, you wanna sit in the corner and speculate, that's fine... - She has a point. - Which is? We don't know who this guy is. I say we come back next year with more money, a bigger boat, - a bigger crew... - The money is gone. The plane tickets, hotels, equipment... This is it. There's no coming back next year. I should've taken that fucking glass blowing class. I'll do it myself. Grant. Why didn't you tell me? It's not your job to worry about it. Rachel. I need to find something, Grant. Anything. I'll man the recorder. Hold on. We are rolling. Grant, do you hear that? Grant? Grant, what are you doing? I need you on headset. What? Come here, come here, come here. Wait... Jesus Christ, we're not recording this. - All right, I'll... - Oh, no, no, no, I got it. I got it. You keep recording in the shower, okay? I heard something in there. Jesus Christ. Oh, hell, no! - No, no, no! - No, no, no, wait, wait! No engine means no generator which means we're running on battery power. Please do not touch anything. Please. If the battery dies, we lose radio and GPS. Everything! Okay. Okay, okay, okay. I promise you I will... Just... Excuse me. Here, help. What the hell is this? - It's a battery. Replace it. - What? You ever found anything with all this bullshit here? Four hundred pounds of crap and all it's doing is - scratching up my boat. - No, don't... Oh, shit. The Marianna. I need more time. Tulls, you saw what's happening. Come on. Be the guy that gives me a break. That can't be the Marianna. Why not? She's coming at us too fast. I see you, Mommy. Do you see me? Is it still coming? Yeah. What direction? It's on top of us. Hey. What's going on? Hello? No. Rachel? Rachel? Rachel? Rachel? Rachel? Here, make yourself useful. Where's Aldo? Come on. Not now. What the fuck's going on? Hey, hey. Where's Aldo? What? Aldo? He's not here. Aldo? Aldo? Aldo? - What happened to him? - I don't know. - Is he gone? - Yes, he's gone. Maybe he went through. Don't you start that shit! That's Aldo. That's Aldo. Tulls... No, Tulls. Tulls, that is not Aldo, okay? He didn't go out in the water. You saw the radar. Somebody's out there. If it's not Aldo it's somebody dying. And I'm not gonna sit here and listen to it happen. - Then let me go. - Hell, no! You got us in this mess. Listen, you stay with the boat, man. Wait, what are you doing? He has to stay with the boat. I'm said I will go! What? So you can prove your fucking theory? Christ, you probably hope he's gone. Hey, shut up! You know what, Grant? How 'bout you get your head out of her ass for two seconds and figure out what the fuck's going on here, okay? She doesn't give a shit about you, she doesn't give a shit about me or anybody else in this boat. That is not true. You don't know what you're talking about. Sure I don't. You're just as sick as she is. You guys are made for each other. Wait. Wait. Here. Take this. And don't leave me out there, man. Aldo? Aldo? Damn it, I got to get the power on in here. Aldo! Move, move, move. Give me a hand with this. Come on. I need more light. The boathouse. Aldo? Aldo? All right, when I connect this, pull that cord over there and see if you can get this thing started. Come on, ready? Go ahead. Aldo? Come on, damn it, come on. Aldo? Oh, God. Aldo? Cassandra? Cassandra? Help me out! Help, help me. Help me! Help me, help me, help me. Pull! Oh, my God, she's gone. She's not gone. Rachel, she was right there. - She's gone. - She's not gone. - She's gone. - What the hell are you talking about? - She's still here. - Who? Cassandra. And... and Aldo, and... Benjamin Briggs... Shut the fuck up with this shit! I don't wanna hear any more of this! I saw them. We are in the rift. I don't believe I'm listening to this bullshit. Grant, Grant, please. We have to try. Please. Okay. Okay. What do we do? Come on. Son of a bitch. Come closer. I know you're here inside. What are you trying to tell me? Were you on the Mary Celeste? This is stupid. Please. Stupid. Did anything here belong to you? There you are. Do you have the disposables? I have one. We want to listen to you. Show me something. Fuck me. Is that you, Sophia? Sophia, is anyone else here with you? Daddy... Your mommy and daddy? Are our friends with you, Sophia? Are our friends with you? We're trying to find them. Sophia, you don't have to be afraid. I know so much about you. I know that your mommy taught you a song. ♪ Little drops of water ♪ Little grains of sand ♪ Make the mighty ocean ♪ And the pleasant land ♪ Little deeds of kindness ♪ Little words of love ♪ Make our earth happy ♪ Like heaven above ♪ I saved some film. Grant? Grant? Grant? No, no, no, Grant. Talk to me, please. You're okay. Grant, you're... Jenny. Come here, Mommy. Don't let him go! What was her name? Jennifer. Jenny. We were in the Sea of Japan. Fishermen in the area reported... problems with their instruments, power outages. I wanted her... to see what I did. I wanted her to see why I was gone so much. So, I took her with me. We were playing our game, she was hiding from me... and then she was just... She was gone. The Marianna. Mayday, mayday, mayday. This is the Allegro. We need assistance immediately. God damn it. Come on. You gotta be seeing this. Oh, come on. Damn it. Come on! Damn it. - Enough of this. - No! No! We're getting off of this boat. You're taking this damn vest and you're putting it on, now! Did you hear that? What? Hey. Hey! Hello? Is that you, Mommy? Yes. I'm here. I'm here. I hear you. I hear you. Can you hear me, baby girl? I'm right here. I found you. I hear you, Mommy? Yeah, I'm right here. I'm right here. Mommy's right here. Rachel, they're here. Let's go, now! It's so warm. It's so warm. It's a sea lion. Yeah, I'm here. I found you. I found you. What? I can't... I can't underst... What? Wha... Tulls... Tulls, we have to go. Tulls, we have to go. Tulls? Tulls, we have to go! Tulls, we have to get out of here. Tulls? Tulls? Mommy. - Mommy. - No! No! Mommy, Mommy... Please... Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy, Mommy... - Grant! - Help me! Grant, give me a hand. She's not gone. What the hell are you talking about? She's still here. Tulls, we have to go. Tulls, we have to go. Tulls, we have to... Tulls, we have to go. Tulls... We are in the rift.
