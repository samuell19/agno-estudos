Why did you get me up here if this is how you're going to be? [inaudible] Hard work, as usual. Did you get my letter? I got your letter. I have something to say to you. RICHARD: Hello Roisin. Little bitey. This man here talking you to death, I suppose. Never shuts up. Hardly much of this talking going on. How are you, Richard? No complaints and all. All right, well, I'll let you get back to motor mouth. Yeah, all the best. Never changes, Richard, does he? What you said in your letter, it isn't realistic. What do you mean it isn't realistic? Time. The time. It's a long time. The time's not important to me, Sean. I told you from the start. What sort of life is that? The life's grand. I'm not complaining. You shouldn't have to suffer because I'm in here. But I don't. What? ROISIN: Suffer. I don't suffer. What am I doing here? Do you want me here? I'm going. There's no point. SEAN: Don't go. Please, Roisin please. You never know what you want, do you, Sean? GUARD: Visit's over. Come on, Dowd Visit's up. You OK, Monger? You still on, Charlie? Must be getting over time. Alimony, is it?

The wife's been up and all. We're on good terms, not like [inaudible] Charley. His girl's been up as well, charlie. So mind how you go. CHARLIE: You guys have more active sex lives than we do. Aye, we put it in the recruiting posters. [music playing] Thing serious with Roisin? I had to sort something out. [music playing] I think it's gonna brighten up today, would you say? What's going on? Nothing worth talking about. I'm thinking of leaving. When? Well, sort of soonish. Are you in? Eh, Take your time. Think it over. You've got a minute and a half. You with us, Sean? Liam, got my snipe? This is for real. You heard what the man said. Jesus, put that away Richard. You're in serious trouble. Don't make me shoot you, Albert. Oh, fuck this. [gun shots] Help. Help!

Hey, Danny, ya mad frigger, trying to wash his hands in a barbwire. - Fuck off. RICHARD: Bad idea. Think what you'll do after? Well there's two options, drop out, go broad, false idea, all that crack, lay low. What's the other option? Stay with us. What is it? Road block. Fuck. Aw, Jesus. Oh, Christ. Talk about bad luck. After all we've been through so far we deserve this skip. Only one thing for it. [engine revs] Just fire. [gun shots] No! Danny! Danny! Shit! Oh, shit. RICHARD: It's all right. - Go. Go. Shit. [gun shots] Don't shoot. I surrender. I surrender. [music playing] RICHARD: Sean. Sean. Sean! How are you, munger? I'm OK. Not bad. Good to see you. Good. How's the shoulder? Yeah, fine. Brought you a visitor. Hello, Sean. Well, I have to pick up a wee package, if that's what you want. What do you think of these? Good, eh? See you later. You look nice. I ain't nice. [moaning] I'll go with you and all that. Anywhere. I don't care. I don't mind leaving people behind. As long as we're together we can start again. Start what? Our lives. You want that? What do you mean? The only way that will happen is without me. It's gonna be all right. You have no life with me. Wait. Sean. How long do you think it could last? How long do you think they will track me? It isn't going to last. As long as I'm around, you have no life. Sean. I have nothing for you. So, you sure about this? You'll be alone. It doesn't bother me. It'd bother me. You're a believer. Yeah, well-- here. Take this as a memento. So as you don't forget us. [non-english]. Stay away from the Irish districts. They'll be looking for ya. [music playing] SINGER: So we're up in the van, and we travel the night. Go to sleep New Jersey, start to feel all right. But the word is out, the boys are back in town. 30,000 bodies start gettin' down. [crowd chattering] SINGER: I don't care if you got the blues, just keep the hell off my green suede shoes. You can do anything you choose, but don't go messing up my green suede, green suede shoes. You all right? Fuck you! He's always fighting. Get a room for a couple of nights. Always. 70 bucks. WOMAN: You want me out of there? Go on, get the-- Here's your soap, your key. Top of the stairs, to your left. Got toilet paper in the room. No visitors. Tommy, what's doing? I need those two veals out there. Come on, move it. Move it. Good, good, good. This one wants to meet it. Come on, guys. Aw, fuck. There's more food on this now than when it was in that fat slob's mouth. Do the job right, Kelly, or you're fucking gone. The fuck are you looking at? Look at you, washing dishes. Is it a problem for you? Not for me. But your people can do better than this. Carptender's job in the Bronx. The - Irish. They are the conference. Like that. You're taking a job that's ours, you know? Hey. I'll give you 10 bucks for the watch. You mean you know how to tell the time? [non-english] What? [non-english speech] What kind of work you were doing before? Laying cables. Oh, bad for the back. Back goes, you're finished as a worker. Listen, uh-- Paco, he didn't mean anything. You don't have to worry about him. I'm not worried. Tulio? Get the fuck back where you're supposed to be. [non-english speech] OK. Sean? You want a beer? Beer? Yeah. It's free beer. The manager had to go early. Come on. Salud. So, why aren't you with your own people? I'm getting by on my own. That's how I like it. It's not much of a life. I'm not complaining. Washing dishes? Every night? Night after night? What does it take to go get you to complain? Well, you know, this is, like, a step up for me. Things must have been pretty bad. So, what was it? What was it? It was nothing. Must have been something. I have to finish up. Yeah. Paco? [non-english speech] Hey, Scott. Yeah? Sitting there. Yeah. [non-english speech] How are you? Good. You know, where I come from, when you meet someone, or you-- you're working with someone, first, straight away you ask, how old are you, are you married, how many children, where are you from? If you don't, they think you're being rude. So, I'm sorry, I-- I didn't mean to stick my nose in. 41, single, no children, Belfast. [laughter] See you tomorrow. Buenos noches. [siren] Richard! Excuse me. Excuse me! What the hell are you doing, man? Sorry. It's my friend. Your friend? Yeah, go see your friend. WOMAN: Open up! Somebody! [knocking] Will somebody please open the door? [knocking] Please, I beg you, there's a fight. There's a terrible fight. It's going on now. There are alays fights. You said so yourself. Oh, no-- somebody's going to get killed. Doesn't anyone care anymore? MAN: Get the fuck off-- don't-- [shouting] Get the fuck off. I'll cut your motherfucking head off, bitch. You got some business here, motherfucker? How about letting these people out? You gonna die, motherfucker. You gonna die. Listen, you don't want to do this. Think about it. You'll go to jail, and that's the end. Please! Please do something! You shut the fuck up! You'd better get your ass on out of here before I cut your motherfucking head off. I'll do waht I can. Please, help me! Go home, boy. Be gone. Cause I'll stick your ass. Well, I wouldn't want stuck. No! Don't leave me! Shut the fuck up, bitch! Don't you dare motherfucking cross me now, you stupid motherfucker. Don't you got enough? Huh? Motherfuck-- Leave him alone! Leave him alone! You all right? Thanks for getting me involved. You busted his face! His beautiful face! I don't believe she did that. She stabbed you! I'm shocked. I'll call an ambulance. No. [clattering] Go, go. What do you want, a dance? Aw, where's the fuckin' mick? Where is he, already? Don't worry. He'll come. Oh, yeah? When he does, it'll be the last fuckin' night he comes. Hey, you. Paco? That's your name? Yeah. Roll up those sleeves. Hey. I prep the greens. It's not my job to wash dishes. It is now, shorty. Capiche? What? Shut your fucking mouth, [non-english]. [phone ringing] Are you looking for someone? Uh the, uh, Irishman? Mr. Kelly got hurt. Is he there? He's up here. Mhm. [knocking] Sean? Sean, I am Tulio. From the restaurant. [knocking] What the hell is going on? [knocking] Hey! I thought you-- I-- you need a doctor. No. No. Oh, man, this is serious! It was a knife. We need an ambulance. No! No. Either he disappears out of here right now, or I call the cops. I don't want him bleeding like a pig all over my carpet like that! We go. [non-english speech] Hey, what could I do? Leave him there? Can you fix him? Well, no tracks. Oh-- that is a definite gunshot wound. In my professional opinion. The professional opinion of a hospital orderly. Ah-- I'm bleeding. Oh-- yes, you are. And that is generally not a good idea. But you picked the right people to bleed in front of. They don't turn away. Know waht I mean? Oh-- Tulio said it was a knife? A girl. A girl? Well, we've all been there. Here, hold that. Hey. Hey. Hey, hey. Come on, you gotta stay with us, man. Huh? You're gonna be all right, but you gotta stay with us. Come on. What's your name? Hey. Sean. Good. Pleasure to make your acquaintance, Sean. I'm Dr. Kildare. You know, Dr. Kildare, in Guatemala? No? That's a pisser. Probably why you left. What do you say, Sean? Huh? You agree with me? Yeah. TULIO: How do you feel? I'm thinking of calling in sick. I have to go to work. Hasta luego. You need to eat something. How long have you been here, you and Tulio? In New York? Mhm. Almost five years. You don't want? I don't want. The one with all the kids-- what's that? My students. You're a teacher? No. Here. I work in a hotel. Doing what? Cleaning the rooms. In fact, they have rooms to clean right now. You're very kind, Monica. Thank you. See you later. Sleep OK? Yeah, fine, thanks. Monica is going to change you. [non-english speech] How long have you been with Monica? Since forever. Childhood sweethearts? Monica is my sister. Tulio-- [non-english speech] OK, OK. I go. She's the boss. What happened here? It's self-inflicted. That's pretty stupid. Yeah, I've been trying to give it up. Who's this photo? That is Carlo Antonio Ramon. He looks sort of-- unpleasant. Is he a friend of yours? He is not a friend of mine. I'm getting better. Good. I'll be able to go soon. I want to thank you. For everything. Thank me, then. Is this the man you reported to the police department? Can't hear ya. I said, is this the gentleman you reported to the police department? Yeah, that's him. Uh-huh. Next time you see him in the hotel, call us, day or night. Thank you very much. - All right. No problem. [non-english speech] He's still here. I should get the Nobel fucking Prize. His life was hanging by a thread. 9 out of 10 doctors, they would have fucked this up. Are you-- you're OK? Yeah, I'm much better. Thanks. Good. Good. That's good. Thanks for sorting it out. Well-- [non-english speech] Hey, hey. Behave. Kids, I'm going to leave you now, but, uh-- you know, if you need something, you know where to find me. [non-english speech] OK. OK. [non-english speech] Do you want to come with me? We are going for a tour. Sure. Are you hungry? Here you get real Mexican food. Not the gringo version. Hola, Pepe. Monica. [non-english speech] Ah. Pepe. Sean. [non-english speech] You like picante? [non-english speech] No problem. What's this? I don't like. You don't like? A friend gave me this watch. A woman? Man. Mm. It looks like a retirement present. Why did you leave Ireland? I've been asking myself the same question. Eat this. It's brilliant. - Brilliant? Mhm. You have a very absolute way of expressing yourself, Monica. Very direct. [non-english speech] Do you like? Mm. Brilliant. Tulio seemed to want me out of the room. No. It's just-- Tulio and Paco, they're always talking about things. What things? Things. Are you bored? I thought you'd like to get out. Get out of my way. All of your stuff is in the office. The office is locked. And Jimmy, the guy with the key, he's not in today. Isn't there anything you can do? No. That's what I'm telling you. No. Come back tomorrow. You can pick it up then. These are from Guatemala. You like? Yes. Do you ever get to go back, Monica? It's not possible. Oh, look. What do you think? It's a bit on the garish side. Aw-- you obviously have no taste. [non-english speech] No. Maybe it was too bright for me. I like. Why is it impossible, Monica, for you to go back home? The government doesn't like my family. Is it an important family? No. My father taught at the university until they arrested him. The government doesn't like lots of families. Here they give Ramon a visa to come and study, even though many people have said he shouldn't be allowed. Are you one of those people? Of course. We had our tour. That's good. [non-english speech] She's a great girl. I suppose so. I'm going out to a party. You want to come? No, thanks. It's not really my thing. Monica? [non-english speech] Hasta luego. See ya, Tulio. Hasta luego. [knocking] Hi. Hi. How did you-- are you crazy? Oh-- I don't know-- maybe I can wear this? Of course you can. Sometimes it's hard to imagine ever talking again to the people I knew. Do you want to talk to them? Don't know. Haven't been that great on my own. What do you think? You look nice. How nice? What's wrong? Nothing. Not a thing. You should do it. You should call them. You look really beautiful. [music playing] I'm better now, Tulio, you know? And I'm going to move on. Where to? Tulio, the reason I couldn't go to the hospital was that a long time ago, I made a decision to get involved with something. I know. Well, if you know, then you know what that decision means. [applause] Gracias. [non-english speech] Hi. [non-english speech] Who is she? She's from the village. [non-english speech] What happened? Nothing special. Soldiers killed her husband, they took her two sons, and they raped her. [applause] We have to go. Tulio? I'll see you later. [music playing] Do you want to dance with me? [non-english]. It's not a pretty sight. That woman was saying something about Ramon? This is Fiesta. [non-english]. [music playing] This is perfect for you. The bolero is the [non-english]. Very little movement. So serious. Why don't you let me touch you? You already have. Yes. But I want more. You're going to make a terrible mistake. My advice is don't do it. Don't do what? Find the guns. What guns? The guns, Monica, that are in there behind the books. Those guns. It's the colonel, isn't it? It's Ramon? Do you know what Ramon has done? I can imagine, but this isn't the way. Then what is the way? When I ask people, how do we get justice, they say Ramon is a monster, but killing him is not the answer. But if it's not the answer, what is? Because if we don't do anything, nobody will. And Ramon goes back to Guatemala with his CIA money, and his CIA guns. If I guessed, so will the FBI. I don't care. If something happens to Ramon, they work out why. And when they work out why, they'll work out who. I don't care. I really don't! Because we have to do this. My father-- my father was just a teacher. He didn't know anything, but Ramon arrested him. He gouged out his eyes while he cut off his ears-- then he killed him. Ramon murdered my father. Should I forget this? I just don't want anything to happen to you. Can you understand that? Do do anything until I come back. I have to go and pick up my stuff. Good. Hello? I want to make a long distance call. Collect. Ireland. Oh, this is good. It's Dowd, all right. This makes me a happy man. Have you an address for me? Yeah, got that. That's signed. All the best. OK, Mr. Dowd. Meet on. What can I get ya? Ah, wouldn't mind a cup of coffee, if you have it. Is it always coffee? Hm? Belfast. You know, after getting a call, saying a friend of a friend from Belfast might be looking in. Said we'd get on famously. I'm Eamonn. Sean. So, what can we do to help? It's complicated. New York's hotter than I thought it would be. I think I need to move. Well, we might find you someplace-- quiet, someplace safe. If that's what you want. Is that what you want? Would it be secure? It's the best. Would there be room for more than just me? How many more? One. Would this be a romantic thing? Well, it might be possible. We're moving someone out on Friday night. If you and your friend want to tag along, we could make arrangements. [knocking] What do you want here? [non-english speech] Maybe you couldn't stop yourself when you opened your legs, but you should have kept your mouth shut, at least. [non-english speech] He knows because of her. I know because I found the guns. [non-english speech] It's all right. He won't say anything. Where are you planning the hit? Come on. Where? Just leave, man. You know you don't belong here. Monica, tell me. How are you going to do this? Sean, Paco is right. I think you should go. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, too, because if I go, you'll be going to jail. If they don't kill you first. [non-english speech] I can help you. I can cut down the risks. I can help you kill Ramon. We don't need your fucking help. You need it if you're going to do it right. [non-english speech] Calm down. How do we do it right? We need better guns. We? Your toy guns aren't going to hurt Ramon. One's a .32. Even if you hit him, it wouldn't do him any harm. The .38's got a barrel that probably hasn't been cleaned since it left the factory. The one who shoots it, he's going to need a new hand after. We need better guns, more of them-- we need money, getaway cars, escape routes to be worked out. Drivers' licenses. Where are you going to do it? We thought the institute, but-- too much security. The only other place is the house he's renting. I need to see it. OK. But I'm telling you, if you make this thing fuck up, I'll kill you. MONICA: That's it. Can we do it? We're in the wrong kind of car for this neighborhood. Let's go. This isn't worth getting killed for. What do you want? Money. Keys. Drive. Why are you doing this? [non-english], eh? What? For pussy. I'd say you've hit the nail on the head, Paco. Except that isn't that what you're doing it for, as well? You don't know nothing about me anymore. So shut up, OK? Hey. Males' drivers' licenses. I'll get the female ID tonight. Hey, man. Oh. Where'd you get all this stuff? It's all my brother's. He got busted last month. See anything you like? His brother. He needs the money. For his bond, you know? He needs the money, like, bad. Come here. Hey, man, watch you don't get shit all over. Come on. Then we head right for the cars. The cars are definitely going to be there. I'm going to check with Scott. I hope so. Don't worry. OK. When we get to the cars, the van gets burn. Clothes, bags-- everything. Guns, too? Guns too, Paco. Everything. All forensic traces get destroyed. Do you know where you're going to go? Yeah. There's a guy I know in Florida. We're going to stay with him. Does he have any connection with anything to do with Ramon? No. He's a gringo, but he's cool. What about you? Some friends of mine. They have somewhere safe. We go see Scott. When we split up, we split up for a long time. Tomorrow it's going to be all right. Tomorrow you'll be sick to your stomach. Don't worry about me. I'll be fine. You don't have to go through with this, you know? Tomorrow can be a normal day. Monica-- I don't think so. You're not afraid of getting caught? I won't get caught. [car horn] [non-english speech] OK, get your gear on. Keep them on. [non-english speech] OK. How are we for time? We have 20 minutes. It was left back there, wasn't it? Yeah. Turn back. Turn back. It's OK. There's time. OK, it's here. [non-english speech] Even now, it's not too late. Be careful. These cars will be armor plated, so we're going to have to get in close. Where is he? [non-english speech] Why are you here, Paco? Whatever Ramon did to you must have been bad. Ramon killed their father. I mean, he did plenty to my people, but-- he didn't do anything to me personally. If people don't stand up for each other, then-- people at the bottom-- then bastards like Ramon, they'll walk over us the rest of our lives. SEAN: This is not good. What time is it? It's 4:15. [non-english]. Drive around the block. We could miss him. If the neighbors call the cops, we're definitely going to miss him. Do a right here. [non-english speech] It's Ramon! Turn! [non-english speech] What the hell's wrong with you? [non-english speech] [non-english speech] [non-english speech] [gunfire] [gunshot] [gunfire] [non-english speech] Ramon! [gunfire] [non-english speech] [gunfire] - Tulio! Cuidado! [gunfire] Tulio! [gunfire] Come on! Tulio! [non-english speech] Go! Tulio! Tulio, you all right? Eh? it doesn't hurt. Tulio. [non-english speech] - OK. - Easy. Easy. It doesn't even hurt. Well. Tulio! Yeah. Hold this here. I think we'll be looking in on Scott. Don't stay long. Hey. [non-english speech] OK. Monica, we have to move! Let's go, Paco. Come on, come on. It's beginning to hurt now. You'll be fine. Come on. Go! Go! I'll come with you. No, I just want a word with these people. I'll be back in a few minutes. Sean? What? Hey, Seany boy. Eamonn. Sean. We OK? I would say so. There's someone to see you. He's here. I don't believe it. How the hell are ya? What are you doing here? Ah, arranging a few wee things here and there. Been here a couple of times. I thought you said to avoid these business? I'll make an exception in your honor. Here, lads, have a drink. [non-english speech] You know, I thought I saw you once on the subway. It's possible. Why didn't you say hello, you miserable fucker? How many of us are still out? Including you and me-- five. So, we're bringing someone along, are we? Has she any sisters? Units in place. Here's your ride. Aye. Yeah. Spend a night or two in here. Great bar, isn't it? Eamonn. Thanks for everything. Mind yourselves, boys. Go. It's cold, isn't it? Crazy as brass monkeys, eh? FBI. Put your hands in the air. Put your hands in the air. Sean! No! Sean, no! Sean! Sean! Sean! [sirens] Sean! Sean! Sean! Sean! [gunfire] [shouting] No! [gunfire] Move back now, miss. Please? Move back. What's this about? Some Irish thing. Move back, please. [siren] [music playing]
