Half the world is on fire. With all those assholes everywhere. People never learn anything. Is that you? -Yes, and Sasha, my girlfriend from next door. She was my girlfriend. We always played together. Hide and seek, and playing "shopping' and stuff. I did the checkout. We got half a cent from my father. That whole family. In ONE night, on transport. I'm still hearing those army vehicles. And those boots. Never saw her again. What did you study? -Medicine. Stopped. I now give surf lessons. Madam, anything else I can do? Well, stop saying madam.

Social interior carer for elderly people in need of care. -You are wasting your life. Please mom, I'm 26. Yad, none of my children will be a cleaner. Go study. -Just like your sister. Understood. Cleaner, seriously? Studying, seriously? -Give back. I'm going to take a shower! I understand why ma does not need him. I understand Dad, he was cheating. She once was deeply in love with him, you know. Really, he just needed more than just ma. Do you miss him? -Once in a while. But he's here. Otherwise, have a tattoo. With his ashes. Mama does not have to know. I'm going to take surfing lessons. What did you say? With your sense of balance for sure? Do you remember earlier with roller skates? You lost two teeth. Just go to such a fun gay sport. Get to know someone again. Handbag throwing, or something like that. Here, Mom does not want Dad home. Maybe he can stay here in the attic? -No. Just for a short time. -No. Well, these are, uh, less black. Something like that. - You are a top chef, you know. Hey Moon, didn't you planned to stop smoking? Didn't she promise Bartje, didn't she? Moon, really! -Yeees. I think my little stinky dinkie should be changed. Is he laughing?

Yes, what, what are you listening? - Spotify. Yes, duh, what kind of music? - You would not know that. Then you do not know me. Julian Stevens. Fat. Very emo that guest, hates his parents fucking much. Yes, duh. That has really stood in everywhere. It was fucking scum. When I was three... three, maybe four, they left me at the video store. Yes. Heavy shit. -Yes. May I? -M-hm. Bon Iver. Fat. Whose is this? Beautiful. -Yes. I'm going to follow you. -Follow me? Yes, on Spotify. -Oh yeah. Cool. -Cool. Do you feel like eating tasty eels from Kees? -No, gadver. What! What kind of Dutchman are you? Not just a cable? -No. How much is this bitch? -Nothing. Already for your birthday. Hey, do I get your number? 06-24552961. 06-2455... Forgot your keys again? Arteriosclerosis, Mom, I have to ring every time, you said that last time. Take your Shoes off, you may step on that poor cat. With those murder weapons. Ma, I'm going to discuss your birthday. That 'Radar'-woman recently said, those things can explode spontaneously. That is all fake news. God save my soul. Are you distroying my antique furniture? These old stuff, ma, really? Why no go to a nice furniture store. Never, even if the pay me. No, I do not need a showroom. Here, you can live. I pay. Money is not a problem. Will you be staying here? I have my housekeeper. Oh, do I disturb you again? Saint Paula is there. Paula, I'm leaving soon! Ma, 80 years, you have to celebrate! - I do not have to do anything. Must is pressure, crying is a child's song. See!? Jamie Verheijen, from Ouderkerk. He is such a great chef. Or this one. Soigne, in Bussum. They have stars. Is really a very special interpretation of French cuisine. Child, I really do not the least interest in all your shit, with three rows of cutlery. Even though they had 12 Mussolini stars. - Michelin, ma. That's what I meant. Pooh. Just give me a croquette from Dobben. Do I hear croquette? Are you going to bring in refugees already? - Simone, just do it! This is my new Paula. -You are the daughter. I have heard a lot about you. Yad. Yad is a really great guy. Don't you read newspapers, ma? -He is not a refugee. He is Jewish. And that makes me a Mongolian? -O, I thought Spanish before. With sun-tinted skin. Are you okay? You did store all your valuables safely, did you? Give me your key! I need your key for him. Oh yeah? -Yes. And who is going to pick you up when you are in the shower with a stroke? Or with a heart attack in bed? Or with sciatica or do I know a lot? He, mayby? Could not care lesss. We all gonna dead, once. Just let it be. I have a spare key. Hello, Simone. -Day, Paula. From 'some plave far away'. Isn't it fun having a daughters? -Well, as if mothers are always great fun to be with. What ever it is, it is such a pity. It used to be such a nice girl! Oh, and a sense of humor! Now it's just a piece of plastic. With a cone. O. Joris? -Yes? You knew, already? That grandma has a new help. Such a Muslim type. You don't do something like that in these times? No, she does. Boy. With such an old person. Can it be possible? Maybe he is very nice to grandmother. - Nice, my ass. He will soon empty her entire house. But we can not say anything about that. Because then it would be discrimination. Nowadays everything is discrimination. In the meantime living of my taxes. That's Dad's money. -O, well, what's the difference? He has a job!? What's up with you? There is something about you. I have to be in the shower. - You should not mess around with your body that much. Ha! Says who? Who is it from? -My mother. Where are we going? -Just you wait. Woeh! Driving needs two hands! Driving needs two hands! Eyo! Why did you come back? Amsterdam was too nice. Study was too boring. 'Too' is never good, says your grandmother. And you? Do you do an education? No. Not currently. And what does your mother think of that? My mother? Do you have a good relationship with her? -Mwah. Are you still going back to Amsterdam? No. Amsterdam is so overrated. Look! It's like a dick. Jesus. Gay. Manke Nelis? -Yes, that man had a wooden leg. Hence. I danced on that music with Jan. Just before he went to heaven. It already 15 years ago. Was a good man, though. But if I had cooked diner, he never said anything. Then I said: Jan, does it taste a bit? And then he said: If it had not tasted, I would have said it. That kind of man, he was. O God, that poor cat is almost at his live's end. I told to that woman at the veterinary clinic: I do not want any agony for that animal. Promptly she sprays him full of expensive junk. Ans, we're going to Mokum sometime? -Who, us? Well no. At my age. No? -No. No. No. Well... No. Well... Yes? Well... Oh, just as we talk about him. * This is silence, with no one around you * And you call that hard work? Hey, I'm a social interior carer for elderly people who need help. -Say, beware, you know. Great guy, your new boyfriend. * Because crying, you only do that * Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. Bye! -Day. Will you be careful, all these deseases nowadays? Oh, did that 'Radar'-woman say something? It's just me. Tell. Are you in love? You can not be serious. I think he is a bit ordi. -How so? Look. That can not be Yad, it is very wrong. - Will it be okay? What do you think mom is going to say? "You're not my son anymore." Do be such a fucker? Mama will certainly accept him. She? Never. She hated Leo also. She also utterly broke that. Just send him a heart. He is super cute. He does have a bit of stupid clothes, but... Heart. Now! This was the last construction project of my father. Beautiful. He never could finish it. He got a heart attack. And my mother got a lot of money from the insurance. How old were you when he died? - Eleven, and a half. Do you miss him? I heard you wanted to sign up for a surf lesson. Yes that's right. And do you really want to surf, or was it an excuse to be with me? -No, I think it's nice. Yes? -Yes. Yes? -Yes. It can't be that difficult? It all goes well! I can not do this. -Can not is dead, your grandmother says. I'm going to help you. Not so angry. Goes well. Stand up, I'll keep it. Find your balance. Yes, look for your balance. Yes, is it? Take it, and easy. Easy, easy! Use your weight! I am holding you. Not from your back, from your knees. Yes? And this cute little ass forward. From here. Do you feel? Yes, now I feel it. Hand in the back, put on, put on the sail until it is completely tight. And then tack! What is that? Right and left do not exist on the water. You only have the sail in relation to the wind. Well done. Very well. Really a little talent, isn't he? What am I supposed to do with him? Yes, your mother will ask that also. He is so sweet. -Me too! And fun. And fucking sweet. -Yes! You do not have a dick, my sweet titty! - O cunt, is that it! Yes, cunt, yes. -I already thought: What do I still miss? Well done! I can take over a few lessons! -Chill. You like that, teaching? Man, if I could, I would take over the whole shop. You have to tack! Right and left does not exist on the water. You only have the sail in relation to the wind! I did not do that at all. Do you find me stupid? No. We've known each other for a while now, right? I thought: Maybe I can treat you. At a dinner or something. If you want. Yes, I want that. Do you know The American Diner? -Yes. OK. But then all the way. -Deal. What a weird outfit. -I have a date! Just behave normal! Say, are you stoned or something? Are you sober or something? -Sorry, sorry, honey. Mum says sorry. I'm going. To my friend. And it does not Matter at all to us what you think of him. But I just got food from the caterer, honey. Small children become big, mommy. Yad, I have an appointment with the loco at the town hall. Which will I weare, what do you think? This, or this, what is a good taste? Usually you do not like my taste at all. Work, dirty. Friends, below my level. Well, Leo, that was nothing. Is this one, again nothing then? Oh, is this him? -Sorry? Did I know long ago, I'm not crazy. So what? What? -What do you think about it? Do you want to hear my opinion? - Yes, please. I would not do it. Just go, wearing your slip dress, ma. Delivers more subsidy. Yad! Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow. Hey boy! Do you know how much time this took? Handsome man. Difficult man. Just be carefull. Hey, guys. Look. Look. They are filthy, dirty fagots, aren't they? - Fagots, fagots. Mister halal, blink, blinker, blinker. LAUGHTER Sure enough, these are filthy, dirty, fagots, or not? Gay. Hey, they do not like pussies, do they? Leave it, Joor. Sorry. Sorry, honey. Gay. That thing on your shirt, what's written there? Coq, girls, do you know what that means? Coq? Coq means dick, ladies. You are completely wrong here. There just has to go a cock in there. There just has to go ao cock in, jut has to go a cock in. -Fagot, just go leave us alone! Yad, wait! - Was that really necessary? What the fuck is wrong with you, man? What? Me?? Come on, man, they! Those guests are really not important at all! You have to deal with them immeadeately, otherwise they will catch you! You would do that also? What do you think? What you do is so fucking stupid. How was it? -Good. Yes, I hear it, yes. We used to fly a kite. -Flying, in Israel? Syria. -I thought you were from Israel. No, Syrie. Do not bother me where you come from. That sounds stupid. Yes, it does, where icome from? That's what I meant. What does your mother think of me? - My mother? Fascinating. Well? Didn't ask her. Important is what we think? Fuck her, she's crazy. Shit. How so? Joris, this has eally nothing to do with you. Oh, fine, it has nothing to do with me. Now I am relieved. I think you are beautiful and nice and sweet, but I have just returned and do not know if I want to be here. Maybe I'll leave again. Look at us. This is not going to happen, man. I'm breaking up, man. We can also just be friends. Just being friends, and what may that be, just being friends? You're going to walk or something like that? A showroom? -Yes. A showroom with what? -Sanitary. Leave me alone again. Maastricht. What the hell. Well, Dad, here we are. Yad. -Hee. Can you help me for a moment? I was looking for activities for children. Yad. Of the asylum centre, you know? Suddenly I thought: What if you are going to give them surf lessons? Fun, just something with water, not too difficult. Good idea, I finally can do something useful with my hobby. -Yes, exactly, that is what I mean! Yes, useful, I mean for the children, because here is water everywhere. For their safety. Yes, indeed mom. Imagine, have they survived that awful boat trip, they are still drowning here. You know what? Just you go to blow all day, right? Messed up your education, well done! And don't forget my terribly wrong friends! O, yes, don't get me start to talk about them. Where are you going? I'm going to smoke. Yad, Maryam, easy. Mamma is not agry, just concerned about you. Worried? -Yes. I didn't have tissues, here. What is this for crazy business? Joris, I'm going to see Dr. Sevasani. In Belgium, you know? That may take a while. Joor? Joris? Joor! Joor? The new Paula. Does Yad find me stupid? That is an interesting question, Joris. Oh, sweet boy. Hey? Yes. Mummy's sweet boy, hey. I'm not going to go to that scammer again. Yes, I already told you, mega-buger. Bungler. Have you been drinking? Yes and quit a lot. You too? I wish that was true. Is it over? What do you mean? Come sit with your mother. Come over here, honey. It is better this way, honey. To much difference between the both of you. Differences? Different? Like you and dad, right? Your underwear is inside out. You have Dad's buttocks. Stay in the middle of the board and not too far forward. Not too far forward! Because why? Because otherwise you fall into it. So why not? Otherwise... You fall into the water. -Very well. Thank you. Grab your paddle. Make sure your right arm is here. At shoulder height. And your left arm at waist level. Not lik this, but like this! Because? You fall into the water. - Very good, he understands. I think I do not like it anymore. - Yad, do you have a minute? Go ahead, boys! Very good, get it right. I think you better go home, okay? Yes? OK. Yes, we're going on! Grab your paddle, very well. Just stand on the board. Nice, that movie. Ho! Just one, you know. Long time ago. The last time was with your dad. THE HOST So, strong stuff nowadays. Hey, Grandma. Yes, I am on my way. -What? Jodokus is not doing well. -Oh, sweet Jesus. Yad was with me this morning. Was not feeling comfortable. So yes? Sweetie, quarrel occurs even in the best marriages. Wedding? I'm not married to him. We had no click at all. And he does not even like that much, so. Ahh. This cat's body is completely gone. Even Blind Maupie can see that. Do you have any special wishes? Spcecial wishes? Yes, more love between the people. I mean burial or cremation. You can choose a group cremation. But he can also be cremated alone. Then you get an urn with the his ashes. -No, no, no urn. Death is dead, gone is gone. -You want to leave him here? -Yes. You've had a nice life with me, do you, my big guy? Yes. Do not want a new one? -And then? At my age you no longer take new pets. Well, come on, we're taking a drink, big guy. Well, cheers. Grandma? Was mom ever crazy about daddy? Not only just her, half Almere. That made her just just so stinking jealous. Especially on that Belinda, with that immense boobs. Then your mother also started to do surgery. But was she crazy about Dad? More than that. Completely in love with him. Ah, my sweet boy. Let me tell you this: you cannot send love, love sends you. You get that one on a tile, for your birthday. Just go to him, look him straight in the eyes. Instead of always looking on those devices. He never wants to see me again. -I did not get that impression otherwise. Boy, never say never. Ugh, just port for me. -You are just like your mother. Grandma, do you have any pictures of Dad and me? No, sorry, honey. I have nothing. That is for me! That is Ankie, or Fleur. Ah. I have to speak to Yad. - Oh yeah? About what? He is not at home. He is gone walking. Surf. So. So you don't like me? You don't even know me. Do that never again!? So cowardly. Jesus, what a rubbish. Taste is something you can learn, ma. Has this garment been laying in the abattoir? It looks like a bloodbath. Say, what happened to Gerlof's stuff? Because that boy asked about it. Do not interfere with my upbringing, ma. As long as you keep doing that way, I will have to. That child craves for a bit of mother love. Mother's love? Seriously, ma? Wait a second. Where were you at that time, when Gerlof was with Belinda... Well? - Your father was just... No, not that weak excuse 'your father died'. He had been dead for two years. Your own daughter was completely in the destruction and you were nowhere. Mother's love, my ass. Madam, you're not allowed to smoke here. This is not smoke. This is very fake, just like all that rubbish here. So, now you hear someone else saying it. It's from the storage shed. It's nothing, just all old stuff. Old stuff? -Yes, stuff. Mess, your dad lp's. You have been lying to me all those years? All those fucking years saying, everything was gone? -I just saved everything for you? I never do it the right way. -Never say never. Hey, is he at home? Do not you dare. Do not you dare! So, it's your turn. X-rated, X-rated. There it goes. No! Aah! Aah! Nice buttocks. How did you get here? -Your mom. This is my father. Nice huh? Aah! Come here. Sorry. Just go. -No, you go. Sorry. Are you dating now? Or, ehm, what is going on? Yes. -Yes? Memories. In 1943, I was also walking here with my girlfriend, Sasha. There were suddenly eight people in the middle of the bridge. I was shocked. Sudenly, one of those soldiers gave me a piece of chocolate. Of course, I had to beat it out of his paws, but I did not dare. I thought that was scary. So I walk on, with my chocolate in my hand, in the direction of Kerkstraat. Andin the Kerkstraat I finally dare to look. Completely melted. From the nerves. I did it anyway. Yes. Well, guys, it's my birthday, my birthday! The whole world is a complete mess, but we have to keep smiling. That's the ways. It really is, isn't it? O. I was a weird man. A very weird man. But.... No, well, look at that! Child, honey! Congratulations Grandma! These are for you. -O, what a bouquet. I'm not dead yet, you know. Well 80 years, is not nothing. Come, croquette? -O delicious. Damn, what a surprise! * She will live long, she will live for a long time * She will live in the gloria for a long time * In the gloria * In the gloria * Hip Hip, hooray! Hip Hip, hooray! I become sentimental on my old days. With all my heart, ma. My dear. What a surprise, is not it? Oh, boy, come. Honey, you have to blow, you know! Hey, cozy, hey, ma! That boy is worth gold, that you have to know. Is that so? -Yes. -Well, then I'm going to sell him right away. Ah, make us a nice dish of croquettes. Let poverty get the plague. Another gift? Really? It is a tile. -Is it a tile, boy? Well, I'm curious. Love does not let itself be sent, it sends you. And that is the way it is. Yes, look at that. Nice, isn't it? Ah! Easy now, dude. Just kidding. Hey old man, we go now. Mom, for you to do the last honour. He doesn't want to come out. Papa has become a stone clog. - What a rascal, isn't he? Go, and help her. -Yes Yes. Come, give it to me. You're looking more and more like your father. - And you're looking more like your mother. My dearest, just to tell you... but someone told me recently, you can get cancer from those electric cigarettes. I do not know who told me that? That women from 'Radar. No'. no. She from 'Kassa'! I am not completely crazy. Yes! Woeh! Yes, nice. Yummy! -Ouch! -O, sorry. Sorry. Ouch, ouch. Where are you going? Translated from Teletekst into English. First correction: MLH, March 2018
