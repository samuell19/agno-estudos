TRAP FOR SEVEN SPIES With Story IRVING JACOBS Screenplay MARIO AMENDOLA ANTONIO ROMAN Cinematography by JOSE AGUAJO Music by LALLO GORI Director IRVING JACOBS I'm sorry, but there are no new assignments for you, Parsifal. I might as well tell you. You're burnt out. The war is over, and all our strategies have changed. Yesterday's friends are today's enemies. Our old Winny has revolutionized everything. There's nothing but chaos in our department. Why don't you try some other kind of work? Indeed. I could place an ad in The Times: "Highly skilled and referenced spy available for... babysitting." Goodbye Solmax. - A whiskey. - I'm sorry, sir, but we don't serve alcohol after 10. Bring me the whiskey, you bastard. Put it in a beer glass like you do for everyone. May I offer? Old Scotch. Caledonian Canal. Please. Thank you. Hello. - Who are you? - I was about to ask you the same question, monsieur. - Are you the landlord? - Frankly, no. I've been looking for him for half an hour, but I haven't seen anyone. How did you end up here? Someone drugged me in some kind of brothel. And you? Glisson. There are things I don't like to talk about. Ah! If it interests you, my name is Louis Bertrand, and like you, I am a guest at the Fairy Castle. Yes, I know. Have you taken a look around yet? Yes, I haven't seen anyone. The courtyard is empty, and so are the stands. I found many closed doors. It seems like we're in an isolated castle in the middle of the mountains with sheer walls that are at least sixty or seventy meters high. Come. Let's keep looking. Are you taking charge of the operation? I'll follow you. We should search systematically. I was walking around randomly at first. I think I passed through the same rooms over and over. This way. Ah, the mystery is solved, monsieur. Someone killed the blonde, and we'll be accused of the crime. Let's prepare to face the police. I've never seen a dead person smoking a cigarette. Micaela! George! Don't tell me it's you. I see that you're also held captive here. - Do you know each other? - Indeed, we're colleagues. Or at least, we used to be. No, it's not my doing. I know nothing about it. But I'm glad to see you... Micaela. Bel-T.D. (a code name) Do you remember our lovely Moravian evenings on the Danube? How much time has passed since then? - A lot. I had hoped it would be less... This is Bertrand. Micaela Oufer, Swedish. Very beautiful. Last night, after dinner, I called a taxi to go home. After a hundred meters or so, the driver suddenly stopped the car. Who gets in? Two guys who sit down next to me. When I finally decided to scream, it was too late. They put a cloth soaked in chloroform on my face. I woke up here this morning in an upstairs room, with a headache throbbing like a power plant. I came downstairs to look for someone, but this chair invited me to get some more sleep. So, you're in a similar situation as us. Bertrand didn't want to tell me how he got caught. No mystery there. A young friend of mine set a trap, and I fell for it like an idiot. He's a car enthusiast, that little rascal. He must have betrayed me for a racing Ferrari. - Where did it happen to you? - Last night in Paris. - And we have today? - Eighteen. Two nights ago for me, in London. So, we should be in sweet France. Welcome to my country. Did you know him too? He had heard us coming and was lying in wait for the ones... who captured him. Indeed. That's right. - And what the devil are you? - Fellow travelers, my friend. Prisoners, just like you. Your school's quite good. - Sir Alex from London, right? - Exactly. Another colleague, then. Clearly, it can't be a coincidence. - Are you also an agent? - Yes, but retired. For psycho-sentimental restorations. How did it happen to you? I received an invitation to a gathering of American ex-servicemen in Europe, with a round-trip plane ticket from New York to Paris already paid for. This is where the gathering was. - They brought me here like a bag of rags. - Who were they? Three sons of bitches. And as soon as we left the airport, in the car, they removed the gathering badges and pulled out Luger pistols. I apologize for eavesdropping on your conversation, but it served to eliminate explanations. My name is Bensacri. I'm Turkish. I worked for the Allies from '41 to '44. I've been in this castle since last night. - Who brought you here? - Ah, no one. I was invited for the weekend, let's say, by a lady to whom I am very devoted. A very efficient butler received me, assigned me a room upstairs, and said I would see my host in the morning. Needless to say, you are the first people I've encountered. So, you're the only one who knows where we are. Bals Castle on the Nantes-Reino, 18 kilometers from Pudre. Ah, I could smell the scent of my old Brittany. Hello. Sorry for barging in without knocking, but some very strange things are happening that make conventions unnecessary. Can you pass me that bathrobe? In short, miss, the three of us and two other men have been brought and captured in this castle. We're in the dark about its purpose. No one has shown themselves. What can you tell us about your situation? I had an appointment here. How did you get here? Who opened the door for you? Come! And the sky in Rome, so blue, suddenly turned black. Someone had hit me. I don't know anything else. We're prisoners of someone who, at least for now, is waging a psychological war. Let's see. The castle is not abandoned, the fire in the fireplace is lit, and the furniture is dusted. The flowers are fresh. That clock is ticking. - Whoever lives here shouldn't be long in showing up. - Indeed... and I have a feeling that will be a tense moment. Found it! Whiskey. And top quality. - Anyone want some? - As far as we're concerned, it's all clear. Well, not entirely. Mademoiselle Nadia is still being mysterious. A million francs would have come in handy. I was supposed to stay as a guest at Bals Castle for about two weeks, providing my expertise on secret warfare in the Mediterranean. The host who invited me... Professor Giles Champital. Yes, I believe so. He was supposed to write a book on that subject. I arrived very late last night. A silent butler received me and escorted me to my room. That's it. - Secret warfare in the Mediterranean, huh? - Yes. - I know a bit about it. - Seven spies gathered here, I suppose you're all part of the same league. Seven, assuming the arrivals have ended. I can't imagine what they want from us. Well, why don't we try to guess? Perhaps they intend to keep us locked in here until we starve to death. No, I don't think so. Damn... - First-class service. - Like the ghosts have set the table. There was no noise. - Cold but appetizing dinner. - Not so cold. Look. Oh, potage parmentier. Poulet a valenciennes, omelette, and souffl?. The finest French cuisine. Ladies and gentlemen, long live France, and enjoy your meal. Please. I'll volunteer as a guinea pig. If it's poisoned food, you'll have to wait and see its effect on me. There's no danger. If someone wanted to kill us, why gather us here? Would you like some? Are you Spanish? Italian. - What's your name? - Castellotti. Your first name... Ruggero. Only an Italian or a Spanish man knows how to look at a woman the way you're looking at me now. I'm sorry. Are you afraid? Should I be? Don't you have the feeling that we're sitting on a powder keg? In our profession, you can be afraid only once. The first time. - Then, if you don't die, you become immune. - Like with malaria. - It's funny. - What? Have you thought that each of us could be the mysterious host? If so, I'd say it's time for him to reveal himself. Why the rush? I have no urgent commitments. And if my absence were to be prolonged, the only ones to suffer would be a couple of bars in New York. I have no commitments either. Besides, I find the place charming, and the company very pleasant. I propose a toast to our mutual acquaintance. You're not very polite, Monsieur Bertrand. The first toast is customarily raised to the host. Baron von Rittenau, Colonel of the Third Reich. Ah, the individual from the nightclub. - And the butler who received me. - Yes, he received me too. I've gathered you here to have the pleasure of killing all seven of you. Exactly that. What is the meaning of this charade? It's not a charade. And soon you'll have the misfortune of realizing it. I had the blanks fired to enjoy, even if only fictionally, your simultaneous demise. For two seconds, you thought you were going to die. But nothing happened at all. But I assure you, ladies and gentlemen, you will die. One by one. And it will be as if you died twice. You've already understood, ladies and gentlemen, that you are all in a trap from which there is no escape or communication! - The necessities of war! - But the war is over, isn't it? No! We are merely in a truce. Great Germany cannot be defeated. And if it is now temporarily dismembered and occupied, it has not happened because of the strength of your arms, but because of betrayal! Because of traitors like you! I have taken you to judge you just as your masters judged those they considered defeated in Nuremberg. - You think I'm mad, don't you? - Yes. No. Perhaps just neurotic, like Hitler. We have just come out of an ocean of blood. How can you still think about war? Man was born to fight! Fighting has always been the primary universal law. Civilization gave us organized combat, history is a list of battles. Invading a country and plundering it, killing the men and possessing the women! That has always been the way of life. Afterward, the great fighter is revered as a universal hero. It can be an opinion. I don't feel like discussing it. I will kill you, ladies and gentlemen! But not without you knowing the reason. You will undergo a trial for which the verdict is already pronounced. But I will be more generous than the judges of Nuremberg. Each of you will have a chance for salvation. Only one...! if you can find it. Why? To challenge you with cunning as well as strength. You are seven brilliant minds. Very well! I offer you a chance to escape your fate. If you cannot discover it, I will have surpassed you in talent as well. A trial with a predetermined verdict is not a trial. It's a farce... The farce is about to begin, ladies and gentlemen, over there. This is the tribunal. And these are your judges. A group of fanatics who have found a new idol to worship in that paranoid. What were you saying, Mr. Bertrand? That all of this is very interesting. There's a presiding judge, but I don't see a defense attorney. - And what would be the use when there are no possibilities of acquittal, not even by appealing to the court's mercy? Then there's no need for a trial either. Do what you have in mind. Spare us this circus act. Calm down, my friend. Keep your nerves in check; they have the machine guns. Mr. Castellotti, this is a trial against spies, traitors, and renegades without whose work no force could have broken the great Germany. Since I cannot kill them all, I have chosen you seven, whose names I obtained from the archives of the Geheime Staatspolizei. You. And now, the floor goes to the prosecutor. Let's begin with you, Bensacri. Yours will be the first execution. Among all the spies, you are the dirtiest. You didn't betray for the sake of serving a country or an ideology, but solely for money. Here's the outcome of your vile work. You sold to the Allies the designs of the German-invented echogoniometer, and that was decisive against the U-Boats. Then it will be your turn, Nadia Petrovna, who carried out your infamous mission under the name of Mademoiselle Yvette. You stole Rommel's battle plans along with information about his fleets. And it was undoubtedly for this reason that our Field Marshal failed to conquer Egypt. And then it will be your turn, Maurice, the great renegade, whose real name is Albert Heller, born to German parents. With a perfect command of our language, it was easy for you to stab us in the back. By communicating the positions of the V-2 rockets on the Baltic to the enemy, which were subsequently destroyed! The V-2 rockets could have given us victory. Our scientists had already invented missiles when yours were still in the dark of their early experiments! German genius is the foremost in the world! But German genius has nothing to do with your crazy braggarts. Then it will be your turn, Hampstead, alias Parsifal. From your hiding place on the banks of the Gironde, you signaled to London the departure of ships loaded with torpedoes for the resupply of our submarines in the Atlantic. Hardly any of those ships reached their destination. Next will be your turn, Bertrand, the former pilot. Twice a traitor and morally bankrupt. From the Italian Supermarina command, you transmitted to the British fleet the departure times and formation of convoys to Africa, which were completely sunk! Then it will be your turn, Micaela. You went by the codename Bel-T.D. In Norway, you facilitated the actions of the so-called partisans who blew up the heavy water production facilities. And finally, you, Castellotti, the former ally. The longest agony to pay the highest price. In Lucerne, you received coded information from some of our high-ranking officers who had turned. You relayed this to Roda, the head of Soviet intelligence. The Red Army had copies of all the attack plans of the German forces. This allowed the Russians to repel and ultimately defeat them. Listen, von Rittenau, why don't you go to hell? In war, espionage is part of the game. Did you not have your own secret agents? I judged you in the name of my country, my people. Your country is not you. The true German people had nothing to do with the few fanatics who led it to catastrophe. All empty words! Go on, ladies and gentlemen. Each of you has a room, excellent food, first-rate service. You can even attempt to escape if you wish. Castellotti will have seven days of vacation. Six for Micaela. Five for Bertrand. Four for Hampstead. Three for Maurice. Two for Nadia Petrovna. And only one for Bensacri, whose execution will take place tomorrow at midnight. You mentioned a chance for salvation? - Indeed. In your room, there will be a pistol. If you find it when the man comes to kill you, you can preempt him. I give you my word that you will be free... after the execution of the others, of course. The trial is over! - Heil Hitler! - Heil Hitler! Nothing. There's no pistol in this room! It's clear that this Ritteau is completely insane. Nevertheless, these skirmishes excite him. I'm sure that pistol is here. Maybe it's all a joke. I don't think so. That scoundrel is dead serious. Besides, let's be logical. How could he put a weapon within our reach? Sooner or later, we would have found it and used it to blow a hole in his head. - It's true! It's so! It's not there! There can't be a pistol! - Stay calm. Let's keep searching. But why against me? Why me first? Am I worth less than the rest of you after all? Or maybe you do think so, like that madman criminal, huh? No one said that. - But you think it. I'm sure you think it. - We're all made of the same clay. None of us is worth more than another. Spies are romantic only in adventure books. In reality, they're sordid individuals everyone despises. Be careful, Parsifal. You're being quite the romantic yourself. - To hell with the small talk! Let's think of a way to escape instead! I haven't thought of anything else since they threw us in here. There must be a phone that connects to the outside. If we could find it... Nonsense. He's a clear-headed lunatic. How do you expect him to leave us with a phone? So, you think that at midnight... - Ah, it's better not to think of anything. No, we must do something! We're all in trouble! Not just me! If he's serious, what good will it do to die 24 or 48 hours later? It won't do any good. But what can we do? Console yourselves with the certainty of a better world in the afterlife? Are you saying I deserve to die tonight? One evening, I had dinner with a man, and he wouldn't stop telling stories. And I knew he would be dead two hours later. Sorry, but your impending demise doesn't impress me. Death doesn't impress when it's someone else's turn. Calm down, calm down. Let's see. Some of you was brought here without his/her knowledge. But you, Nadia, and you, Bensacri, knew you were coming here. Did you tell anyone where you were going? Someone who might be suspicious of your long absence and start looking for you? No. I didn't. - Neither did I. Maybe there's someone who might look for me. But with what information? Even if they had all the police in Paris at their disposal, they would arrive here long after the seventh funeral had been held. So, should we die like rats on a sinking ship?! - Listen! I'm going to the dining room. We'll meet there shortly. I have an idea. If it works, we'll all be out of here in an hour. Speisezimmer, schnell! No, Philippe, I'm not acting like an adult at all. In fact, I'll tell you that I can take these things with a great sense of humor. What? Well, that's a surprise. But you have the nerve to deny it. Ah, you admit it. That's better. Have the courage of your actions at least. Just a moment, please. Listen, Philippe, I... - Miss! Miss! Mi...! No, no, Philippe, let me talk. You know how I feel about this. In matters of love, I'm one of those who give their all but want it all in return! I don't tolerate half measures, ambiguous situations, and lies. If you think I can stand sharing you with someone else, you're dead wrong! This is the Foug?res switchboard. Go ahead. Miss, miss, please notify immediately... - Just a moment, please. No, it's pointless for you to come tonight. I'm telling you it's useless. I have a commitment. It's none of your business with whom. No, dear. That would be too convenient. Go ahead. Miss, please listen to me! It's a matter of life or death! Vor der Kaserne Vor dem grossen Tor Stand eine Laterne Und steht sie noch davor The police, miss, can you hear me? Alert the police! Yes, at Bals Castle! ...wir steh'n Wie einst Lili Marleen. Miss, please respond! Miss, the police! It's not clear, there's interference! Please call back! Miss! Miss, listen to me! Emer... Very clever, Mr. Maurice. I confess I underestimated you. You've been shrewd, the shrewdest of all. And in a way, that makes me proud. There's some good German blood in your veins. I'll remove all the phones so you won't be able to use your talent, at least in this area. Listen, let's not separate! Stay together in my room or one of yours! At least until midnight! Don't leave me alone. What good would it do? Barricade yourself in your room and try to find that pistol. I'm sorry I didn't succeed in my attempt. Well... I tried. Maybe tomorrow we'll come up with a good idea. But tomorrow will be too late for me! Courage, my friend. Perhaps nothing will happen. That German probably just wanted to instill a lot of fear in us, and he certainly succeeded as far as I'm concerned. Yet I can't help but feel a certain gratitude towards our baron. Because he gave you the opportunity to meet me? I was expecting a line like that. I'm sorry for not being more original. But there are things that have been said and done for thousands of years in the same way, and they never lose their originality. Love, for example. It certainly seems that way. - That's how it is. An Italian always has the right gallantry for the right moment. Is this the right moment? What does you think about it? You always answer a question with another question. So do you. But I'm the one who has more life to live than anyone else, so I can afford to wait. As you wish. I understand that words of love must have become boring to you. You were chosen for this profession because it's unlikely that a normal man wouldn't be ready to lose himself for you after meeting you. Is that so? It seems so. - So it is. I have an important revelation. I must... I must speak with the colonel! No! No! No! He's the first. There are no more doubts. The baron is serious. I'm glad you've understood. You lied about the possibility of salvation. There was no pistol in this room. A German officer never lies. The pistol is there. Here it is. You didn't think to check your own pocket. Very simple, right? But you had to think of it. Until tomorrow, ladies and gentlemen. Or perhaps you want to witness the burial of the wretched remains? You're not interested in attending the sad ceremony? Of course. You are the unsung heroes who, when they die, get nothing more than a brief obituary that distinguished them... "Agent 18 deceased in the line of duty." A wound, right? Von Rittenau: A damn shrapnel from Stalingrad, but it doesn't bother me at all. I'm fine. I'm doing very well. It's preparing to land. It's a modified B-24 bomber. There must be an airport not too far away. Comforting news. I'll remember it when the Viking comes to unload his parabellum on me. Oh, no, no. Our amiable host is full of inventiveness. He won't repeat himself. He has a grenade fragment in his head. Von Rittenau is a trauma-crazed lunatic. What's your chance of survival? I don't know. The trauma-crazed lunatic didn't tell me. But I will let you know, and you'll have to take advantage of it. In a way, Von Rittenau keeps his word. You saw with the pistol, right? It was there. Ah, yes. But he placed it after we had searched the room. I remember looking in the coat pockets, and it wasn't there. But what matters is it was there when it had to be... Listen, I have an idea! - What idea!? There's nothing to be done. There's a hidden microphone. I don't like you very much, Maurice. Why don't you tell us how you got into the Allied intelligence service? The Americans don't have much of a tradition in espionage. Well, in part, you already know. My parents were German, and I was born in Germany. When we moved to the United States, I was about three years old. German was always spoken at home. So, I owe my perfect knowledge of the language of Goethe... that one day I was called to Eisenhower's staff. Listen, I have a proposal for the colonel. I have some information to sell to him, and he might pay for it by giving up his plan. So, shall we try? Agreed? - Agreed. Baron von Rittenau, we need to talk to you. Go ahead, Hampstead. I'm listening. Set us free, or better yet, leave with your people. We'll remain locked in here for another three or four days. That will give you time to leave the country as a guarantee against any reprisals from us. Before leaving, you can send a letter to someone who will come and get us out of here. If you're not delirious, Hampstead, I believe you're willing to offer a significant deal. - I'll reveal Bormann's hiding place, Martin Bormann, the number two figure of the Third Reich. The man who managed to escape the gallows at Nuremberg, and whom the Allies have unsuccessfully searched for all over the world. I know where he is. You... You know where Martin Bormann is?! I'm a spy, Colonel. Why didn't you make this offer right away? Because we didn't believe you were serious. Now we're convinced. Give us your word that you accept my offer, and I'll point out his hiding place. You have my word. I trust you. Our lives for your word as a German officer. [German] I must admit you have courage! Much better, much better this way! I don't like slaying chickens. I prefer boars that fight to the end. Tonight is your turn, Nadia Petrovna. Thanks for reminding me. Don't skip dinner before going to bed. There's a special menu. "Faraona arrosto". (roasted guinea fowl) It's your chance of salvation. You bluffed, Hampstead. You don't know where Martin Bormann is. Yes, in hell! Since I was a child, I've always loved thunderstorms. It's a gift for my last night. How can you be so calm? I give a massage to myself. So, one of those robots will come to strangle her. - Listen, I know what we'll do. Let's not repeat the mistake we made with Bensacri. Shortly, we'll leave to return to our rooms. Nadia will stay here, turn off the lights, and leave the door ajar. We'll come back quietly and stay here, all together. We'll defend her. We'll get ourselves killed if necessary. There's no point in prolonging the agony. Agreed? - Agreed. No matter how it ends, we'll have spoiled the madman's little game. The noise of the thunderstorm will help us not be heard. - I'll be waiting for you. And I thank you. - Let's go. The night has passed, and nothing happened. At least... it seems that way. If the German failed, it's a good omen for all of us. Wake up, Nadia. There's a new day to live. She's dead. Back! A Brazilian coral snake. Its bite kills in twenty seconds. So that's what "faraona" meant. Cleopatra's death. Well, you're brave to show up without an escort. Otto and Kurt are out here. If you don't mind, I'll do my laundry. I admire your composure. You have three days left to live, and you're thinking about doing your laundry. But the rather hasty way I was brought here didn't allow me to bring spare clothes. And I like cleanliness. Bel-T.D. You're in love with that Italian, aren't you? People are always in love with someone. Of course. I know many things about you. Captain Rudolf Riend. Does that name ring a bell? Chief of Staff for the Eastern Army Group. Yes, quite a character. He killed himself, as far as I recall. I found him myself with his skull smashed. He had the pistol in his right hand and your photograph in his left. I took the gun from his hand quite easily, but to remove the photograph from his tightly clenched fingers, I had to tear it away. What a pity. It was quite a good photograph. I didn't understand how one could be so reduced by a woman. But now I realize it. Near you, one can easily lose their mind. And I feel like I've lost mine entirely. I want you! - Leave me alone. You have a scent that drives me crazy. The scent of death, Baron. You won't follow the fate of the others. You will come with me. I will keep you with me forever. Let me go and take a piece of advice. Never embrace a woman with a Mauser P-38 in his belt. I always carry it with me. My life is precious right now. In any case, it seems you're offering me a choice between your bed... and death. - Yes. If you put it that way, yes. Your bed is certainly more tempting, Colonel. But death... is less repulsive. Geh weg! Geh weg! I'm pretty sure I saw it right. There's a campsite down there with people having a picnic. Some of them are. In a few seconds, we'll have a perfect view with the binoculars. There's a guard of sorts, but evidently he must be making the rounds of all the terraces. In two or three minutes... I should have them. It has to be perfectly filled, without air bubbles. - Yes. Here it is. - The wax. Your mirror, Micaela. Thanks. Gathered to witness a vote of censure for the boy scout Ren? Champrie due to his lack of seriousness toward the Corps. Yesterday, as you may recall, he claimed to have seen a lion among the trees. This morning he swore he had spotted a herd of alligators past the big bend in the river. I personally went to check. There are no alligators. Silence! Ren? Champrie, do you perhaps intend to make a mockery of our organization? You will remain on camp duty while we go on our exploration. Get ready! Quick! Form a line of two. Gather your gear. Head northeast. S... O... S... Po, po... li... ce... I propose a second vote of censure for the boy scout Ren? Champrie. Yesterday he claimed to have seen a lion, this morning alligators, and now, no less, prisoners up there in the castle. This is too much. He will march at the rear of the column carrying the gear. Forward, march! It's your turn tonight. Your chance of salvation will be higher. I respect you for your German heritage and because you're American. The Americans defeated you, Colonel. Not the Americans, it was betrayal! - Ah... I forgot. They were right when they wanted to reach Berlin before the Russians. They knew the Soviets would engulf Europe and the world. On the night of April 16, 1945, Marshal Zhukov attacked on the Oder River with twenty thousand cannons, four hundred Katyusha rockets, over five thousand tanks, and air cover from six thousand planes! The bombing storm was so fierce that the Russian gunners' ears bled. The defense was led by our General Gotthard Heinrici with only 350 guns, no air support, and no reserves! But he won! He won by stopping the Russian avalanche on the Seelow Heights. We are well aware of the heroism of General Heinrici and his soldiers. But the war is lost, Colonel. You must face reality. Germany will rise again! It has already risen! The Fourth Reich will challenge the world once more under the leadership of an exceptional man placed by destiny. - And that exceptional man is you. Tonight, you will be set free. The moorland around the castle extends for four or five kilometers. If you manage to reach the main road or the river, you might encounter a car or swim across. In either case, you'll have won the game. Of course, in the moorland, you won't be alone. I'll be there to hunt you down like a fox. If you're as cunning, smart, and resilient as a fox, you'll make it. It's time, Mr. Maurice. How much of a head start will I have? Five minutes, then I will leave... and the hunt will begin. I wish you good luck. Well... goodbye. - Goodbye. If it brings you any comfort, know that I envy you. Now I feel that we must pray. Ruhe! Ruhe! Geh weg. [German] Hans mit mir. Hans weiter! [German] Stop! Stop! Siegfried the 18th has claimed his third victim for the pyre of his Valhalla. A pyre! That's what we'll do. If we had thought of it earlier, those three poor souls wouldn't have died. A pyre! I've been waiting for you. I immediately called the Foug?res fire station, but you had already left. Your service is truly commendable. My compliments. But you've gone to all this trouble for nothing. Something was burning here. But it's already completely extinguished, as you can see for yourselves. I had ordered my servants to burn old books and many useless papers, and these fools chose the most inconvenient moment. It's better to take a look. Go! But I assure you... - It's our duty. Go, go! I've rented this old castle for a year and live here alone. Alone? Ah, yes, alone. Well, with these two servants. No women? - No... Come on, guys. Was it your idea to start the fire? Quite naive. Hampstead, tomorrow at midnight, one of my men will empty his submachine gun on you. Go to the library! Your salvation is there! Are you one of those who believe in destiny? Believing in destiny is a way to justify defeats. Even in love? - Especially in love. It's curious. By all human predictions, we have no chance to escape immediate death. Yet I feel calm, serene. Is it because I'm in love? It seems so. So it is. How beautiful life is... And like all beautiful things... you appreciate it most when you're about to lose it... or when you've already lost it. Once in the desert, we almost ran out of water, and the few drops that each of us got were enjoyed more than drunk as if they were the most precious of treasures. It was just water, the water we waste every damn day without even noticing. We have life rationed. Here, we won't waste those few drops of life. I'm not afraid to die. What scares me is how. Does it make a damn difference? Yes, a lot. Dying from a gentle poison or being struck down by a clot in an artery... is different from dying with a rope around your neck or from the shocks of an electric chair, for example, which kill in 8 minutes. It's physical damn pain... that I can't bear, you understand? Yet it exists, it does! There must be a way to escape this maniac! Of course, there is. Killing ourselves. To spoil his little game... we could drown in the bathtub or cut our veins, or even damn stab ourselves... With these old scissors, for example. I found them at the bottom of that drawer. What do you think? Would they damn work? Who knows if they'll reach the heart? Ah, stop it. It's from Hampstead. He says to meet him... on the west terrace. Listen, this time it's for real. I had some dirty luck, my friends. - What happened? The madman actually gave me a hint. My chance of salvation was really in the library. I started searching among hundreds of books, and that's when luck came to my aid. In an old volume about the history of this castle, there's a description of a secret passage, a long underground tunnel that leads from that well among the ruins of an old, dilapidated house. I've looked through all the books in the library, and I've never seen what you're talking about. - Of course, he just placed it there now to prove that the chance of salvation existed. But they'll keep an eye on the well, and they'll see you when you escape. The passage is described in detail in that volume, and the well is not the only entrance. There's another one in the fireplace in the armory. I've studied the layout very carefully. After I've escaped, barricade yourselves in a room. It'll take some time to find someone or a phone. Hold out until the police arrive. There's no need for that. You don't have to wait until midnight. We'll gather for a poker game after dinner. You'll make your escape earlier, and we'll keep playing as if he were still here. I fold. One hundred francs. - I fold. - I'm in. Two hundred. Let's go. - How many cards? - Two. How many for you? - Two. I'll take one. Five hundred francs. I'll call. I fold. Well, what do you have? Aces over Kings. That's the fourth poker. You're quite lucky, Hampstead, huh? Indeed, I've won almost a hundred thousand francs. I know I'm playing with good people. You'll have the amount sent to my heirs. - And how will we do that? - Oh, right. Plus, I don't have any. Whose deal is it? - It's mine. No, you dealt first. It's Bertrand's turn. Oh, right, it's Bertrand's turn. Five francs to enter. Hey, aren't we pushing our luck a bit too much? - I want to make a comeback. Aces and Kings opening? - No, why? ??? I fold. - I fold. I'll bet twenty-five francs. I'm in. - Me too. Watch out, watch out, Hampstead looks like he's done for. Your turn, Castellotti. Alright. One thousand francs to the dealer. Ah, it was a bluff. Well, I didn't fall for it. He made me fold with two aces. Can't trust the English. How about a round of teresina? Okay, sure. No invitation? - No, for teresina, it's not necessary. - Oh, right. I fold. Looks like it's my turn. Ten francs. I'm in. Me too. A seven, a queen, a seven, and a nine. It's Micaela's turn. Yes, twenty francs. - There it is. Me too. An eight, a jack, an eight, and an ace. - I fold. Poor Hampstead, a seven, a nine, a jack. Did you see? The secret passage did exist. Indeed, with your assassins waiting at the exit. Hampstead's chance of salvation was not to use the passage and stay here, where no one would have looked for him. He didn't guess correctly. I had said one of my men would shoot him. But I hadn't specified where. Tell your master I accept his offer. Sage deinem Herrn, dass ich mit seinem Vorschlag einverstanden bin. - Hast du verstanden? - Geh weg! Geh weg! What offer? None of your business. Maybe it is. You've found a way to save yourself, obviously. Yes. It's my chance of salvation. And it won't fail. So it seems. So it is. Listen, Micaela... - Get out of my way. Don't you even want to hear what I have to say? No, I don't want to. I know all the flowery lines you're ready to throw at me. Just get it in your head that I'm willing to do anything to save my life. Got it? I'm willing to do anything. Even endure the lecherous cravings of that Hitlerian swine. But in the end, one more or one less... Well said, one more, one less... I've done it before, to steal information, to turn into a suspect, to delay an order. What do you expect from me now? A grand gesture of heroism for the sake of making a heroic exit? Oh, not for me, thanks. I couldn't care less. And I couldn't care less about you either. I'm neither your wife nor your sister. It's my life I'm defending. It's my life I want to save! And I will save it. Do you think you have rights over me for a few kisses? Poor fool! Just five days ago, I didn't even know you, and in five days, I'll have forgotten you. And what's so terrible in the end? It's the darkness of death that's terrible. The other darkness, the one in a bedroom, has many appreciable sides. And in the dark, believe me, one man is just like another. Sounds like the graduation thesis of a prostitute. What a nice phrase! Quite effective. Now, would you let me pass? Please, go right ahead... madam. Don't take it so hard. - Don't bother me, Bertrand. But, what did you expect, anyway? - Damn it! Shut up! Are you happy, huh? It would've been your turn tonight. But nothing happened. Oh, I have no illusions. It was just a postponement. - No, it wasn't! It happens that you're safe. And so am I. But haven't you figured it out yet? The noble sacrifice of the beautiful Micaela saved both our lives. Hurray! A toast to the allure of the beautiful and exciting Domina. And a requiem for those poor four idiots who died only because the pious Dulcinea made up her mind too late. Stop drinking. I'll drink as much as I please. Got it? Isn't it alcohol that drowns sorrows, huh? You're unfair to that poor girl. I know that... Go to hell! What do you know about these things, sissy? I really want to punch you in the face. And I'll spend the rest of my days wondering why the hell I didn't. May I come in? I've been waiting for you. Do you mind if I light up? I turn the lights on? - You're the master. I have one condition that my two companions are also saved. Not just the Italian? You heard me. I imagined as much. It couldn't be any different. I promise to follow you wherever you want. The other two will stay locked in here, waiting to be released entirely at your discretion. I also pledge not to betray you. Never to run away from you, never to denounce you. Castellotti and Bertrand won't either because in your hands, I represent a secure hostage. You've thought of everything. Yes... Maybe I'm asking for too much. No. A man like Captain Riend killed himself because he was deprived of your kisses. How could it be too much for me to save two lives just to have you? You won't regret it. You'll be the woman of a man who will become great and powerful. A more frightening weapon than the atomic one will soon be at my disposal. Millions of men will pay with their lives for their foolish illusions of victory. Is it to speak of blood and death that you came here? No... No... Ein Flasche Whisky, bitte. Herr Oberst will eine Flasche Whisky. Herr Oberst... [German] So, so. Herein. Micaela! ???? I didn't give him a chance to escape! Go! Quickly! - They're coming! To the courtyard! Come on! Here! ???? We'll never get out of here! - To the well, quick! Micaela! Come on, Bertrand! - After you. Go on, get down! - It will never be said that a Frenchman lets himself be beaten in courtesy. Please! Listen, Micaela... Maybe there's no time, and maybe it's futile. But can I ask for your forgiveness? Let's go. Mr. Castellotti, which way? At the top of the hill, there's the gate! Come on! Under! You on that side! You others on the other side! And you with me! You on that side! And you up those stairs. Let's go! Unbelievable... Disarm them and take them away. You'll see they won't resist. Come. THE END Subtitles by djvaso@KG
