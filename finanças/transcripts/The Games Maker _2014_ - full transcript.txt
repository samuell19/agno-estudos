Everyone who loves board games knows that they are as numerous and diverse as life itself. Games of chance, ingenuity, strategy. Games that can be played alone, with a partner, or in a group. Some invented hundreds of years ago and others only recently. But when board game enthusiasts are asked to choose an adventurous, fantastic and thrilling game the life of Ivan Drago comes out on top. Where did the game come from? Was it the brain-child of a great inventor? How it came to be is a great story, and one of the squares at the beginning, the one that shows a ferris wheel, is a good place to start. Come on, Ivan. We'll be able to see the whole town from the top. It was Ivan Drago's 10th birthday. His parents had brought him to the fairground thinking there could be no finer present for their son. [laughter] Thank you. Don't be afraid. You know, your old man used to fly real balloons. How about that? Terrific. Say Joey, keep us spinning will ya? Here come the Drago's! Aw, take that you-- Oh you did it, oh my goodness! Nice to meet ya. It's embarrassing. Let's try the carousel. He's too old for the carousel. Alright son, you know what, lets get you home. If we hurry we might catch the beginning of Emma's wrestling. Then something happened that would change Ivan's life forever. Are those the prizes? Yes. Hit the apples and you take home this rare old backgammon set. Ivan, you know our family doesn't play games. Oh come on, just this once. It's his special day, look. Look. Never mind. Two direct hits get you dominos. Oh. One apple gets you this checkers... set. But the stall attendant was unusually generous this day. Hey, don't forget your consolation prize. For Ivan, this was as good as any prize he could have won. Ivan! You're going to miss the last round! Invent a game and send it today. Ivan, come on! Roll the dice and draw a dream in each square. Each player has one minute to draw his dream. Only one dream can be drawn in each turn, the player who fills in the most squares is the winner. [car horn] Ivan? Wake up, it's late. With every roll of the dice you have to draw something in the appropriate square. Like an airplane if they want to travel, or the moon. Hi mom. Ivan, do you want cheesecake or chocolate? Chocolate. And if they can't think of anything they don't draw. What are you doing? I'm entering a competition. Ivan, it's an old comic. The competition is probably over by now. Does it have a name? It's called what do you want to be when you grow up. Mrs. Drago helped him. Not with the games themselves... But by hiding Ivan's activities from his father. As Mr. Drago had a strict no games policy in their home. Remember Aldis, you know, Aldis. Shared an office together when I started at the bank well I ran into him at lunch today. He told me his son little Aldis is taking up rugby. He offered to take Ivan around the club next Saturday. That doesn't make sense. A player can't steal other players dreams. If they do they lose. Napoleon, ocean liner Napoleon. Ocean liner. Third on the right. [loud horn] Ivan? Ivan, wake up. There's a letter for you. Dear Ivan, we are delighted to inform you that your game has placed you amongst the top ten thousand entrants in our competition. In recognition of this achievement please find enclosed our official company certificate. Should you wish to continue competing for the first prize you must invent another game which the company will arrange to be collected from your home. Warmest regards, Morodian. Master Superior of the Profound Games Company. Ten thousand? This competition could go on forever. A competition that goes on forever. An endless competition. That's it! Daddy's wrestling game! [laughter] Wow! Out cold! Oh, that Bone Crusher is an animal. These are the good guys, like the Mountie. Senor-- he fireman's carry Frankenstein, Choke Bomb, Steve Lady's Man Johnson, Killer Manjaro, the Time of Death, these are the baddies. Bone Crusher, Senor-- the Guillotine penalty of course, dirty tricks. Knock, knock. Ivan. Hey, there you are. Beautiful day for a bike ride. What do you say, son? Hmm? Concerned about Ivan spending so much time in his room his father encouraged him to take up sports. Cycling was not a success. However, the experience inspired Ivan to create Tour De Stars, the game that propelled him into the third leg of the competition. Dear Ivan, congratulations. You are one of our top 100 finalists. This news encouraged Ivan to keep inventing but he didn't dare tell his father who still dreamt of his son becoming a great sportsman. Thank you Mrs. Drago. These activities were a source of great inspiration for Ivan. Over the following months he submitted five new games based on the most popular sports, each one more amazing than the last. Dear Ivan, you are now one of the top 10 finalists chosen to compete for the grand prize. We await your next invention. For the final round of the competition Ivan's imagination took flight with the creation of around the world in 79 days. No doubt inspired by Mr. Drago's return to his lifelong passion for hot air ballooning. Son, up here! [doorbell] Ivan. Dearest Ivan, it is my greatest pleasure to inform you that you are the winner of the competition. Congratulations! And the prize, our companies insignia, a symbol of pride to carry with you for the rest of your life. The great game is just beginning. It's one of those tattoos you get with bubblegum. At first Ivan was so disappointed. He showed no interest in the prize. But by the following day curiosity had got the best of him. And on the third day he discovered that the tattoo would not come off. Ivan! What is that boy doing up there? He's indoors all the time, he's reading comics, doing puzzles. There's something I have to tell you. What? I want you to get rid of this tattoo immediately. I can't! It won't come off, and anyway it's the only proof that I won a competition out of 10,000 people! Ivan! Okay, okay. Maybe we should just try to calm down and ignore the tattoo and forget this ridiculous competition. It's not a ridiculous competition! You don't understand! I won. I'm a game maker! You have no idea what that symbol means. You promised you wouldn't tell him. Ivan. I was worried, I had to tell your father. Just leave me alone. I never want to see you again. That night driven by a sinister premonition Mr. Drago phoned his father with whom he hadn't spoken in 10 years. Ivan. Wake up. Visit Zyl, the games capital of the world. See the worlds largest jigsaw puzzle. Take a stroll around the famous lost pieces centre. Lose yourself in the worlds most complex natural labyrinth and attend a games workshop hosted by engineer Gebbler. Three time winner of the world renowned tournament of inventors. You'll encounter the world famous magic brain which will answer any question you put to it. Hello everybody, I'm Nicholas Drago and it is my great pleasure to invite you on a tour of Zyl. All the world's most exciting games are right here waiting for you. That's my father. Your grandfather. My grandfather? A game maker? Oh yes, inventor of such world famous games as the End of the World Race, Crystal Cathedral, and of course the legendary Giant Jigsaw Puzzles. Is he still alive? Yes, he is. Why haven't you ever taken me there? Why haven't I ever met my grandpa? Because, Ivan, ten years ago I made the decision to cut all ties to Zyl and the world of games. Why? It's complicated, but just know that the only reason I did that was to protect you, Ivan. I did it for you. But now things have changed, now it's extremely important that the Drago's are reunited. We'll go to Zyl on Sunday, after the balloon race. Ivan was unable to sleep that night, he wrote a beautiful letter to his mother saying that he was sorry. By daybreak he was dressed, ready to go with them to the balloon race. (Radio): Weekend forecast: moderate to strong south easterly winds. We're expecting blue skies throughout the day, mostly clear in the evening now stay tuned... Perfect ballooning conditions. He'd even been thinking about a gift for his grandfather. And what could be more appropriate than a new improved version of his last game, renamed Flight to Zyl. [gunshot] Woo! Ivan! As usual, the weather forecast was wrong. Conditions were suitable, the winds were light, which is why no one could understand how the accident happened. What could have caused the Drago's balloon to separate from the others and drift away? In the days that followed Ivan asked himself over and over again how this could have happened. But there were many challenges to face before he would find the answer to that question. [doorbell] I don't want to come here. The judge decided what's best for you. You should think yourself lucky. That's right, young man. Possum is the best school for miles around, some very important men went there. But the school, it's sinking. Oh yes, they say it was built on a swamp. There's plenty of floors. They just make a new entrance whenever the old one gets too low. It happens everywhere. Look at Venice, it's been sinking for years. Good morning, Mr. Drago. Welcome to Possum. I hope you realize how fortunate you are that the court chose to send you here. To Possum. Since this academic institution opened its doors over 100 years ago it has scaled the heights of excellence. But the school is sinking. Oh, you've noticed. It is something of an architectural conundrum. Personally, I believe it is due to the weight of knowledge. Now, if we could just complete the formalities. Sign here, and here, and here. Congratulations Master Drago, you are now officially a Possum boarder. Right then, I'm sure you are I'm not going to live here. I must go to my grandfather in Zyl, has anyone told him I'm here? Grandfather? In case you hadn't noticed Master Drago you are an orphan. As such if no one comes to claim you then you cannot leave this building until you are 18 of course and then you are free to do whatever you like. Frau Bloom, could you come in please? Frau Bloom will be your personal guardian, she will see to it that you never lack for the warmth of family affection. Frau Bloom, please take Master Drago's case to the dormitory. (Class): Good morning Principal Possum. Good morning Professor Katz. It appears one of your pupils doesn't find it necessary to say good morning to his school principal. I would like you all to inform me of his name. Or are you all prepared to pay the price for his disobedience? Levinchen Levinchen. I should have guessed. Anyway, I'm here today to introduce you to a new member of the class, Ivan Drago. [violin playing] Master Pluncket. This class is not a music class. Anyway, Master Drago will serve as a good example for you all that not everyone is fortunate enough to have a family. Let alone one with sufficient means to send you to a great institution such as ours. We are happy to welcome for the first time in many years an orphan to Possum. Carry on Professor Katz. Where'd you get that fake tattoo? Master Krebs. Talking without permission. That's yet another black mark for you. That was your fault, Drago. You'll pay for this. Next! Listen dummy, this version is out of date. Now come on everyone, you all know how this works. The more cards you buy the more chance you have of winning. Now get out of here before I lose my temper. Hey. What are you playing? Compound fracture. It's the second edition of Ruthless Wrestling. That's weird. This is just like a game I invented called Endless Wrestling. You invented a game? Yeah right. It was based on the TV show. I wouldn't know, none of us are allowed to watch TV. If you're such an expert maybe you can give me a hand I'm getting thrashed here. Sure, I know this game inside out. Hang on, where are all the good guys? Look, Frankensteins signature move is a choke bomb which beats the Bone Crusher's guillotine choke and counters the Parking Attendants dirty tricks. So, you can't lose. What's a Guillotine Choke? Okay, look. Bone Crusher's signature move is the Guillotine Choke, like this. But as the Undertakers signature move the Body Scissors like this That's a crap signature move! Who said you could draw this? I didn't draw it, it's real. Where did you get it? I won it in a competition. Did Morodian give it to you? Yes. What did he say? He said he met Morodian. So you make new games. Silence you idiots! He's a liar. The only one who knows Morodian around here is me. And if I don't have a tattoo no one has a tattoo, especially a pathetic little worm like you, Drago. [bell ringing] Come on, let's get out of here. Saved by the bell, this time. Remember Drago, we're the Lofties. We rule this school. Be aware that you will have electricity from sunset until 2100 hours precisely for the sole purpose of reading educational books. As it's your first day I won't ask you to wash the dishes. Time to go to the dormitory. What about dessert? This institution has never offered dessert to pupils. It may seem a little big at first, but in no time it will feel just like home. Report to the dining hall at 0700 hours. [creaking floor sounds] Psst! Psst! [whispering] Psst! Ivan! Ivan, don't be afraid! We're in the same class, I'm a boarder here too. That's not true. Only boys go to this school. Are you a ghost? No silly, I know only boys are meant to go here that's why I had to make myself invisible. Anunciacion. Principle Possum told me that I was the only boarder. Well, that's what he thinks. I live here too, inside the walls. I know this building better than anyone, even Principal Possum. What do your parents think of all of this? The same thing that happened to you happened to me too. What? Hot air balloon accident? No, not so original. Car accident. When Krebs saw your tattoo in class today I could see how angry he was. In class? But you weren't in class. Yes I was, above the blackboard behind the painting. I see everything that happens. Well, everything except the blackboard. This guy Krebs, how come everyone puts up with him? Up until recently everyone thought he was a joke. Then Morodian visits Principal Possum and Krebs suddenly has all these strange games. Morodian came to the school? Did you meet him? I only saw him from a distance. They met in secret. From that moment everything changed, Krebs seemed to have all the games the minute they came out. And he was the only one who knew all the secret playing tips. What's he like? A little-- Drago? Mr. Drago. Are you talking in your sleep? Remember Mr. Drago. Silence is one of Possum's hallmarks. Do you want to hear more about Krebs? I'd prefer it if you told me how to escape from here. Escape? You're really leaving so soon? You just got here. I need to meet my grandfather, he's a world famous game maker. He lives in Zyl. The contest I won and my parents accident, my grandfather is the only one who can help me find out. How are you going to get there? Next Friday is a holiday. I'll just say I have to go home for books and clothes. [chanting] Bone Crusher! Bone Crusher! One week. You have been here less than one week and now everyone plays games but in a very different manner. Listen. [chanting] Bone Crusher! Bone Crusher! Bone Crusher! You Drago are nothing short of a noxious plague upon our educational institution. A plague? Yes, Drago. A plague. You're going to be grounded, permanently. That's not fair, you can't do that. From now on all days off are suspended. No weekends, no holidays, not even public holidays. Frau Bloom! [children chatting] [chanting] Guillotine Choke! Guillotine Choke! Guillotine Choke! Professor Katz? May I go to the bathroom? [children talking and yelling] [chanting] Frankenstein! Frankenstein! Frankenstein! Hey, Drago! [children talking and yelling] Ivan! Thanks, they're saying they want revenge. It's Krebs, he hasn't been to school the last few days. What does it have to do with me? He tried to give himself a tattoo and now he's in hospital with a nasty infection. This is my room. I was really lucky to find such a good place to study. Our classroom is just behind that wall. Here, I wanted to show you something. I saw Principal Possum opening this. And I also found all these. He spent all last night trying to do this jigsaw puzzle, by morning he'd thrown it out. What is he doing now? There's a message, channel 3 - Now he's going through your desk. [bell ringing] If you don't get back right now the punishment will be worse. Worse? Keep an eye on him, I'm almost done. Channel 3 at midnight. I can't believe this is the only TV in the whole school. Old Possum doesn't believe in television. Except when he's watching it. Great. What time is it? It's almost midnight. [choppy voice] Dice making... remember... so if I place half on one side what should I place on the other one? The material in which dice are made of is very important. For example cardboard is highly unacceptable. Rubber is also not acceptable. This will be all for today, see you next class. Tomorrow at the same time on Tele-Zyl make your own game with Professor Tramunte. That concludes our broadcast A, good night. We'd better return this. This is an important message for Ivan Drago. Ivan, I hope you're seeing this. I'm Nicholas, your grandfather. I've been trying to find you ever since I heard of your parents tragic accident. I went to that fortress of a school you go to and they turned me away. Ivan, you are the youngest in a long line of Drago's, the most famous games makers in the world. I'll be broadcasting this message every night and I hope that fate brings you safe and sound to Zyl soon. I do have a grandfather. He's waiting for me in Zyl. I'll escape from this horrible school. That won't be easy, Ivan. What if I managed to close it down? How are you going to do that? Take me to the library. It's two floors down. Nobody ever goes down there, they think it's haunted. As each floor sinks they close it. This one was abandoned 10 years ago. Really? They say the last boarder who tried to escape got chained to the post in the library. When it sunk he drowned. And after all these years he's still trying to come up for air, and when he does you'll hear a splash. Actually, you know what, maybe there's no point in going down there. The damp will have destroyed all the books and we won't be able to find anything in the dark. Ivan. Look. What do you think we should be looking for? The school's mystery. A buildings secret? There's got to be a structural weakness that is making the building sink. It just needs to sink a few feet in one day and they'll close down the school. But it's only been sinking one floor every twenty years. Maybe we can speed up the process. What were you saying? Don't worry, they're only stories. Look at this. [gasping] We're taking out a book, shouldn't you fill out a library card? [cricket sounds] Here, look at this. Pass it along. [chatting] Don't ask, just take it. Oh yeah, we just found out. I'm so excited. I know, I wonder what it's going to be. [chatter] Frau Bloom, keep a close eye on Master Drago today. [chatter] It's clear. Ivan, Principal Possum is gone! Gentlemen! What you are about to take part in is not just any game. It is one of the oldest games in history. A treasure hunt. It is - [whispering] Psst, Ivan! Over here! What are you doing here? I thought we agreed to meet at the railway station. I had to make Frau Bloom secure. Why haven't you started the game yet? Ivan. I needed to get as many players as possible or else it won't work. There's only one train a week to Zyl and it leaves in an hour. Don't waste any more time. Now, is everyone ready? (All): Yes! Yes. He's here. Okay, here are the clues. A man of marble proudly waits, within his hands he holds your fates. His memory long but his sight is short and tucked in his glasses you'll find what you sought. Another clue. To the principals office. Come on! Pinned to their names the butterflies sleep, spiders don't weave and locusts don't leap. Weave, I know! Come on lets go! These are the things he pretends he owns as he hears the rattle of his yellowing bones. I got it! Yes! You didn't get it? So, what do we do now? Just follow the others. Drago! [cheering] I'm going to get it! I saw it first! Mine! Give me it! No, no, no. Going somewhere Drago? Bleach, acids, abrasive cleaning pads. And sandpaper. Ugh!!! [door rattles] Frau Bloom, help! I'm locked in! Can you hear me? If it doesn't come off after [door rattles] [crowd yelling] Good lord, no. The sinking points. Ahhhhhhh!!!!!!!! Endless Wrestling! I've got it! I've got it! [struggling grunts] Don't let him get away! Krebs! [ground rumbling] He dreams of the future, full of glory and pomp. As slowly the school sinks into the swamp. This way, over here! Oh no! We've got to get them all out! My violin, have you seen my violin? Have you seen it? Oh my god! Has anyone seen it? Principal Possum! Just a minute! Those ones too! You alright? [coughing] Alright. That's one, two, three, four, yeah that's the last four, everyone is safe. Oh if not for you Ivan we would still be in there. [chanting] Ivan! Ivan! Ivan! Ivan! Ivan! You'll pay. Pay for this, Drago! One for the press, thank you. Ivan! Ivan! Ivan! I don't care if they think you're a hero, Drago. I know you planned this whole thing, you won't get away with it. Master Drago! You cannot leave this school! You are still grounded! Drago! [panting] Did the school really sink? Uh, completely. Completely? I didn't think anything that drastic would happen. It was only meant to sink a few feet. All aboard! Where will you live now? Back with my Aunt Elena. I ran away and now it's time I went home. Thank you. Good bye Anunciacion. [train horn] Why don't you come with me? I could say you're my sister. No, Ivan. It's you they're waiting for. Will you come visit me in Zyl someday? Of course, I'll pop up when you least expect it. Tickets! Tickets please! You're getting off at Zyl? Yes, why? Normally people only get on the train at Zyl. Tickets! Tickets please! You seem to like drawing. Well, just to sketch my ideas. Inventions. You know, I keep finding lost property in the carriages. Look at this, I saw an ad for good illustration courses in this old comic book. Zyl is our next stop. Don't fall asleep. What if he doesn't see anyone and got back on the train. Well, obviously that would be your fault. My fault? Ivan? Sorry we weren't here to meet you. Your grandfather had us waiting. I'm Knight. I'm Bishop. They call us... (Both): The Checkmates. I'm Ivan Drago. Hey. What's that? What? I won it in a competition. You know what that means in Zyl? It's the logo of the Profound Games company. What's it got to do with Zyl? Come on, your grandfather will explain. Where is my grandfather? He sent us to meet every train so there was someone to welcome you. He hoped you got his message. Oh, that's Zyl TV station. That's the museum. It's the first place people visit when they come to Zyl. Except nobody comes to Zyl. The mayor had these made a few years ago. The mayor, as in your dad? Yeah, okay, my dad. The thing is he puts them there so that the train passengers won't see how deserted the place has got. Hello, Checkmates. The magic brain! I saw it in the film about Zyl. Yes, it's the original. But it's closed down. Why? Your grandfather will explain. [knocking] Nicholas? Nicholas! Ivan? It's you! Oh, you solved the puzzle I sent you! Oh well done, oh! Oh. [coughs] Please excuse my coughing, it's the blasted fans I have to keep on. Thank you, Checkmates! I'm leaving the keys to the truck over here Mr. Drago. By the way Ivan, if you like fishing we go to the River Rubic every day, you should come. Bye. Come on, lets get you settled in. Come on, come on. My grandson. Little out of fashion don't you think? Your father and his friends. He didn't really talk much about growing up in Zyl. Your father grew up with a different approach to life. I never thought I'd have a son who did not share my love of games. Grandpa, I want you to read this. No one ever knew where they ended up on that race. No one told us that they had found their bodies, and then I found that. This is a comic book, Ivan. I know it's not fair but we have to learn to accept our losses no matter how incomprehensible they may seem. Hot air ballooning. Oh my goodness. Listen, we have each other now. You must be hungry after your journey, I'll fix us some dinner. So, young Ivan. Tell me about your interest in games. Well, I invented some games for a competition that had over 10,000 contestants and I ended up winning. Ohhh! This was the first prize. It was sent to me by Mr. Morodian, have you heard of him? Your father loved spaghetti. Do you know Morodian? Ivan, you are now with me here. Zyl is the world capital for games inventions. Grandpa I'm, I'm happy to be here I just... I couldn't help noticing the town it seems a bit quiet. Well, that's true. We have seen better times, but those of us who stayed in Zyl feel that the glory days will return to us here. After all, it only takes one game to change everything. Dessert? Coming right up. Now, are you working on anything new? Well, I am working on something new. It's kind of like a spinning top. One side makes a player invisible to his opponents. The way it works at the moment players don't have an equal chance of winning. You can't let that hold you back, you play a lot of board games with mismatched sides. Do you know any of the famous hunting games, do you know Comycan? No. Well, your grandmother won the world championship for five consecutive years. To be honest I've never actually played a board game against anyone else. Oh my god. At home my parents. Oh no, we can't have that. Follow me. Some people call it Inca Chess, but others know it as the Puma and the Dogs. But if you're the puma it's one against twelve? Correct. As in all hunting games the sides are mismatched, but if he's smart the puma can still win the game. You must always have a strategy, use short rapid strokes and he takes by leaping. Comme ca, comme ca. Create spaces for yourself and you eliminate dogs one by one. And Comycan. Shall we play a game? What do you want, puma or dogs? The puma. No, alright alright. Go on. The first key to victory is never giving up hope no matter how many opponents even if the odds are stacked against you. And Comycan. How were you able to beat me so quickly? A game like Comycan requires skill, not luck. Rematch? Grandpa, I think this competition is somehow linked to my parents. The second key to success is concentration. Look. What's up with you, Ivan? You haven't said a word all day. I'm trying to figure everything out. I've never met Morodian and he's everywhere. I thought my grandpa could give me answers about what happened to my parents, he doesn't want to talk about it. I think the explanation is the one my father always gives, everything bad is Morodian's fault. I have to see the magic brain, it's the only way to get an answer in Zyl. I told you it's temporarily closed. Temporarily closed? But I've never seen it open. Look, my father promised me they would open it again. Yeah, well your father promises a lot of stuff. He promised to prune the old labyrinth and now it's scarier than before. If someone goes in they never come out. And what about Zyl TV broadcasting in colour? If he didn't manage any of that there's a fat chance of him reopening the magic brain. Shut your mouth, Knight. There is a chance. For the record this is the first time I've ever stolen anything from my father. Oh my goodness. [clicking sounds] Ivan. Do you want us to leave? Are you crazy? This is the first question in 20 years, I'm not going to miss it. Magic Brain, can you explain the link between this, Morodian and what happened to my parents during that balloon race? [clanging sounds] [mumbles] Ivan, I think you should ask simpler questions, you know? Yes or no answers. Okay. Are my parents alive? [clanging sounds] [mumbles] What is it? Yes or no? It's a yes. No. It's a yes. Stop. You're wasting your time. It's only a game and no more than that. Life's great decisions cannot be left to a machine. So, what about this? To understand we must know the past. To comprehend the past we must go to the museum. Who goes there? I'm calling the police. Oh, do calm down Zylmar. It's only me Nicholas. It's after midnight, so you must be Ivan. My name is Zylmar Canobias. I am the curator of this museum and also the security guard. This puzzle was made by your great-grandfather, Blaze Drago. Here we have the Rubic River which marks the southern boundary of the city. Up to the north the abandoned labyrinth. There is the magic brain and here is the museum. And the missing piece? I'll leave that one to Nicholas. It was Morodian. That piece had a picture of his house on it. When he stole it it was as if he'd taken the soul of the city. What use is a jigsaw puzzle with a missing piece? Morodian lived in Zyl? Morodian's parents own a missing chess pieces store. His mother ran off with a traveling salesman. His father, poor soul, decided one night to go looking for her. Through the labyrinth. [thunder and lightning] That night Morodian became an orphan so I took him in. You raised Morodian? Your father and Morodian were almost the same age, they grew up together. Your father never shared our passion for games. But Morodian, he became my apprentice. But as the years went by something seemed to sour within him. His games became darker, more sinister. He said that they were from his deepest nightmares. Soon thereafter he submitted his entry into the young inventors tournament. His entry was called the Labyrinth of Death based on his fathers terrible demise. Zyl was not ready to accept someone so different so Morodian at the age of 20 was banished from the town. He blamed me. Was it your decision? No one was willing to take responsibility. So we finally decided to take it to the magic brain. The brain replied yes. Morodian felt that I had betrayed him and he left that same night committing one last act of defiance. He left a letter. He attacked me for abandoning him to the whim of an old machine and said he wished I had never taken him in. He finished the letter with a terrible curse. The dynasty of Drago inventors will end with you, Nicholas. Your father left town shortly after to begin his life. And you never heard from him again? Not until his call informing me of your existence. But now I realize it was his choice to keep you a secret. But Morodian got what he wanted and was able to find me. But now, now, now. He actually didn't get what he wanted. You want to be a games maker, a great inventor, you're living here with your grandpa in the right place. Forget Morodian. I can't ignore Morodian, he's been making me play this game without explaining the rules and I think he's the only one who knows what happened to my parents. Sorry grandpa. But don't you understand? That's exactly what he wants. Please, Ivan. Don't make me lose you as well. I have to find out what happened to my parents and the only way to do that is to face Morodian. No, Ivan. Don't Ivan! Please! It's a trap! Don't do this! Zylmar! Zylmar! [panting] [train bustling through] [panting] Ugh!! [coughs] (Grandpa's voice): The keys to success are confidence and concentration. [knocking] Company. Company this is Mobile 1, over. This is Company, what have you to report? Over. Taking passenger, repeat, the passenger to The Company. Over. Sir? Sir? Could you please tell Morodian that I - The Profound Games Company Headquarters, Terminus. I want to see Morodian. Name. Ivan Drago. Take the elevator to the top floor and wait. Ivan Drago is entering the Profound Games Company. [elevator ding] Oh, you're here, sorry I was supposed to meet you at the door. I'm Ivan. I'm Ivan. I know, I know. I'm not really Ivan, I'm a professional Ivan. A fake Ivan? No, no. Not fake, professional. This is my job. You know, I had a feeling you'd be arriving any day because they didn't seem that bothered with me anymore and I had begun to suspect that they were going to replace me with the real thing. I want to see Morodian now. Morodian? I don't think you will be able to see him now, he's probably still dreaming. No, no, no, no, no. We have to wait because when the red light is on it means Mr. Profoundus is dreaming. Interrupting him will be unforgivable. What are those? panmonitors, Mr. Profoundus's bodyguards. They have 360 degree control, brilliant isn't it? Who's that? A dream scribe. Dream scribes are responsible for noting and interpreting Mr. Profoundus's words, based on what he says to make his dreams wonderful new games are created. Mr. Profoundus? Yes, that's how Morodian wishes to be addressed. Anyway, as I was saying at the beginning of the world obsessed by my acting. Watch, your tenth birthday. Shwoop! Shwoop!!! And how about this, organizing the treasure hunt. This is not just any game, this is one of the oldest games in history. How do I sound? I've got a five year contract to play you in other shows, five years. Shows? Yeah. The life of Ivan Drago. It's by far the best attraction in the whole of Profound Park. This one is Ramuz, the chief scribe. Mr. Profoundus, the real Ivan has arrived. Are you Ivan? Welcome. Ivan. You must be very happy. Happy? Why would I be happy? Excited. Grateful. Overwhelmed. No. Why should I be? Why? Why? Because you are in the true mecca of games invention, it wasn't easy getting you here. In fact it took years, I had to intervene repeatedly in your life. Intervene? What gave you the right to do that? I want to know the truth about my parents accident. I must confess I'm rather surprised to find you so ungrateful, especially considering the fact that Profound Parks main attraction will be a game bearing your name. Only a few more days now, hours. The big opening is nearly upon us. Oh, but where are my manners? We need to get him settled in. We need to get you settled in. Come, let me show you the factory. The engineers room where my ideas are transformed into games, come and meet Lazarus one of our chief engineers. Ivan Drago. Don't bother talking to him, he's deaf. Lost his hearing working on a dynamite game. Dynamite games about to go on sale to the general public, sure to be a big hit. An explosive success. But, once you've detonated it. Yes, you have to buy another. You learn fast. Poor thing, can't keep them awake. Yes, here at the company we consider work and leisure to be rather old fashioned concepts. Death Trap? I know this game, they used to play it at Possum. I never really got it, as far as I could see the player who has more cards always had an advantage. Correct, the player who has purchased the greater number of cards has-- A greater chance of winning, yes. I find that traditional games give children such an unrealistic idea of life. Equal opportunity, level playing ground, all those ridiculous myths. This game teaches children the truth, those with the greater means at their disposal have a greater chance of success. Now, the companies best selling games are the ones that spring directly from my dreams. They belong to the nightmare series. Nightmare? My grandpa said that when you were in Zyl. Silence! Company rule number one, it's forbidden to utter the name of that place. Oh, this is rather interesting. Now, anything that's no longer of use to us is sent into the games garbage and there's so much of it. You see, all of our games are designed to be obsolete within six months of purchase, it means the customer always has something new to look forward to. Do people work down there? Like I said anything that's no longer of use to us is sent down there. Garbage men don't usually last that long but Gabbler, he's survived for quite some time. Who? Gabler. Exceptional engineer but his heart just wasn't in the job, I had to find a new role for him in the company. Possum? Principal Possum? What's the matter? You seen a ghost? Hurry along now, your induction starts in two minutes. It will be a true inspiration to my workers seeing the last hope of that decadent city installed here at the Profound Games Company. Your arrival will guarantee that Ivan Drago's life becomes the parks greatest attraction. And it will also prove that life is indeed a game. Ivan's childhood. Spent with his doting parents. Until their unfortunate hot air balloon accident. Next, Ivan's brief sojourn at Possum and the dramatic sinking of the school and then came Ivan to the capital of decay. But we would never leave our customers without a grand finale and so Ivan Drago like so many others before him joining the Profound Games Company. Listen, Morodian. Mr. Profoundus, whatever you want to call yourself. My life isn't a game, that balloon out there, it's not a toy. My parents were on board and I want to know what you've done with them. It's late and you've had a long journey. I'll tell you what, go to bed get some rest tomorrow you'll start working for the company. No. I don't want to sleep, I want the truth. Ahh! Ah! Ah!!! Ivan needs to rest, you must sleep. So tomorrow he can begin his new life in our great company. ...Thank you for your visit, please exit out the front door. Welcome to the home of Ivan Drago, we at Profound Park remind you not to touch any of the displays. You are walking inside an exact replica of Ivan's childhood home where he lived in the years before the tragic accident that befell his parents the day their balloon drifted into the high mountain peaks, never to be seen again. After two weeks of tireless searching authorities confirmed there were no survivors. An only child and without any living relatives... [panting] [panting] Mom!!! Dad!!! An excellent replica. Don't you think? Really quite remarkable. Well, come on. Up you get Ivan. Give me your hand. There we go. It's time to see where you'll be working. Come. I'm very excited for you to see your office, Ivan. Where people will watch you working inventing games, signing autographs, oh strictly one per person of course. And here we are. Well, jump down, have a look. Tell me what you think. I don't like it. Really? You don't think seeing Nicholas Drago's grandson working for me is an amazing ending? Come on. Maybe for you. Not for me, and for the visitors I don't think so. Oh, you may have a point. Perhaps I need to look deeper into my dreams to find the perfect ending to Ivan Drago's life. Don't I have a say? Well, we could work together. Two great inventors joining forces to create the ultimate game. Yes, I dream, you write. It's been decided. Remus will show you what to do. Forget it, I'll never be your dream scribe. I'm going back to Zyl as soon as you tell me all you know about my parents accident, and give back that puzzle piece you stole. Have it your way, Ivan. You're free to leave whenever you want, but there is one last thing you really should see before you go. Who knows, it might just help you change your mind. You know something Ivan, you and I we possess a gift that these fools can only dream of. The ability to create amazing games. I'm nothing like you, Morodian. For you games are dark and brutal. But of course they are. Did granddaddy teach you nothing? You're young. In time you'll understand life is the most brutal game of all and when the time comes to crush your opponent Ivan you must show no mercy. Winner takes all. Sorry, but you're wrong Morodian. I'll never join you. Really, I can't tempt you? You must be hungry you haven't had any breakfast. Oh, very well. Just like mama used to make. Oh, by the way, behind you this is going to be a really big draw, we've just got a few teething problems. Krebs! Krebs, you idiot, I said above the water not in the water. Hey, Drago! Not the sharpest tool in the box your classmate but very loyal. And here we are, a little girl with the extraordinary talent, she can camouflage herself against any background. Anunciacion. Poor thing, you know the three of us have much in common. Well, I'm glad to see you're resigned to stay. Get settled in you'll be my dream scribe tonight, my chamber 3:00 am, don't be late. If you put a watch close to his ear he dreams of his father. The sound of a silver spoon in a glass of water and he dreams of ships. You must write down every single word that Mr. Profoundus utters. Take this. His most vivid dreams occur during the hours before dawn, you will meet me at 3:00 am do not be late. Mr. Drago, can I have an autograph? Mr. Drago! Hey! Mr. Drago! Can I just say what an honour it is to have been chosen to play you. An honour. Look, this is what they gave me when I was hired. Ivan Drago is resourceful, brave and determined. I'm nothing. Nothing? You're a legend. Come on, take a look. Brave and determined? That's a joke. But of course you are, you won a competition that lasted more than a year, you sunk a school. I could never have done those things. You, Ivan, you're a hero. You know, I was thinking, shouldn't we prepare before the park opens? Oh yes, I'm a bag of nerves just thinking about it. Which is why I want to help you rehearse. Don't open the door to anyone until I get back. [electric sparks] Mr. Gabler? [electric sparks] Gabler? [electric sparks] Mr. Gabler? Ivan Drago! The real Ivan Drago in person. Yes. It's me. What are you doing here? I came to ask about my parents. You won't find them in the garbage, but if you're asking if Morodian was responsible for the balloon accident the only person who can answer that is Morodian himself. If you're trapped down here how do you know about the balloon and my parents? There's something you should see. This room is dedicated to your life. Why? When he discovered who you were and was able to see your talent well he put all his energy and resources into fulfilling his curse. His aim was to separate you from your family and luring you here will be the final nail in Zyl's coffin. A double victory. Did she read this? Apparently so. Escape. Look at me. I too came here thinking I could stop this monster. No, I can't just run away. Morodian kidnapped my friend Annunciacion. He showed me her theatre. Have you seen her? Could be a trap, be careful. I don't have much time, how do I get back up top? With a little help from our old friend. Victor Jade. These were all printed to bring you into the company. Now perhaps they'll help you get out of here. If you know the way out why don't you go up top? If I ever leave here it will be to go back to Zyl. Tyrelas, we have to get Shark Pit ready. Yes sir. Anunciacion! Anunciacion! How did you find me? Morodian showed me your theatre, he's a monster. I'm sure he had something to do with my parents accident. I'm hoping they're here. I haven't heard anything since they kidnapped me two days ago, Morodian's been making me rehearse day and night. I have to go, he wants me to be his dream scribe but I'll come back for you. I promise. Don't come back here, it's too dangerous. Lets meet in my theatre. panmonitors will come take me to rehearse soon, but don't worry about it. Considering they have three brains they're pretty stupid. Making myself invisible is kind of my specialty. We'll find a way out of here. You're late. Be careful not to wake him. You wouldn't want to suffer the wrath of Mr. Profoundus. [heavy breathing] (Sleep talking): Yes father, yes father I'm coming. I'm coming. Where are my-- No questions, I'm tired. So tired. Where are Ivan Drago's parents? What parents? Ivan Drago is an orphan. I didn't mean to hurt them. I didn't want to. What did you want? To keep them away. So Ivan would join the company but the wind, the wind took them to the mountains within seconds, they're frozen solid. Frozen solid. We sent an expedition in search of them, all they brought back was a bag. [alarm wailing] Do you really think I'm that stupid? [alarm wailing] Mr. Profoundus, is everything alright? Where's the boy? Deactivate the alarm! Yes sir, immediately. Make a note, loyalty test failed. Tell the panmonitors to fetch Mr. and Mrs. Drago. Anunciacion. Anunciacion! Ivan, over here! In Mamma's Cakes! Come on, we've got to get out of the park! What about your parents? No, my parents are. No, Ivan. There's a man and a woman, I just saw them. They look exactly like your photo. They were taken by the panmonitors. Smell those cakes, my mother was just here I'm sure. I'd know that smell anywhere. Still hot. They must have just taken them! Oohh!!! UGH!!!!! My parents, have you seen them? Oh, you mean that was the real Mr. And Mrs. Drago? Amazing. Where were they taking them? Oh, this tunnel leads to the shark bait tank. Oh no, Krebs! Who are you? Why are you following us? He's the fake Ivan! Not fake! Professional! Ivan! No! No! Help us! Ahhhhh!!!!!! Hang on honey, it's okay, it's okay. No! Please! Stop! Someone help us! No! Anunciacion, distract the panmonitors. Stop copying me! Sorry. You go that way. Okay, fine. You're crazy! Ah!! Hey guys, I'm over here, come get me. Oh my. No! Ivan! Ivan! Don't worry, I'll get you out of there! Son! Put them down, Krebs. Okay, have it your way. No, no. Ahhhh!! Ahhhh!!!!!! Hang on, hang on honey. Get off me, Drago. No! Ivan, watch out! [fighting grunts] Ivan, are you alright? Stand by, Drago. Now lets see if your parents can swim. Pick on someone your own size. How does this work? Up, up! Put it up! No, not that one, the other one! Mom, dad! Ivan! What the-- Ivan, are you okay? Ivan, watch out! Put it up! Be careful! Anunciacion! Keep the cage swinging! Are you sure, Ivan? Don't worry, Dad. I know what I'm doing. Okay. [shrill scream] Ahhhhhh!!!!!!! Yes! Well done, Ivan! Yes! Ramuz. Sir? We missed you so much. This is Anunciacion, my invisible friend. How are you doing? Hi. Come on! We've got to get out of here fast! The balloon! The balloon. Yeah. Thank you for everything Ivan. I don't know who you are, but thank you. Lets go. It was nothing, dad. Dad? Send every panmonitor to the balloon. Now! Come on, hurry! Other rope Ivan. Okay, this ones cut. Get the rope. Hang on everybody. Okay. Honey, get the ballast. We're ready for takeoff. Okay, igniting burners. Honey. Ivan! Ivan, come back here! Ivan! Son! Ivan, look out! Run, Ivan! No! Ivan, look out! Ivan, come back here! Ivan! Run! So, I create all this in your honour and you repay me with betrayal. I dream up the perfect ending and you refuse to play along. And look at you now, Ivan. Back where our game began. You're surrounded, you cannot win. (Grandpa's voice): By never giving up hope even when faced with many opponents. Say goodbye to your parents, Ivan. I've no use for them now, but I'm afraid you and the jigsaw piece are staying here. Oh no, Ivan. Ivan, don't be ridiculous. We know your life story here. Everyone knows you're a hopeless shot. Mom, dad, duck! Bravo. This is the end of your curse on my family, Morodian. But it's just a tiny piece of cardboard. What matters is the last of the Drago's remains here with me, that's the fulfillment of my curse. No Morodian, no. As of today the curse is lifted. Oh please, you've never played a game in your entire life. I wouldn't trust you to move a single playing piece. Maybe not, but I can move in real life. Oh, you have my sympathies Ivan. Not even a word goodbye. Oh well, here you are alone, abandoned, orphaned for a second time. Just like me. Take him down to his office, back to work, nothing has happened here. Ivan! Don't let the balloon advance, don't let the balloon advance! Gahhh!!!!! You idiots, stop the balloon. Stop the balloon! Stop it! I won't let you get away with this, Ivan! Ivan! Ivan! Ivan! You got it son, you got it. Ivan! [grunts] Take my hand! All this could have been yours, boy. You've got it, one at a time. Ivan! You can do it! You think you can beat me! Huh? All this was yours Ivan! Yes! Mom! Comycan! [explosion] [laughter] Those of you who have played the game 'The Life of Ivan Drago' will know that it is not made by the Profound Games company and that it ends with Ivan's triumphant return to Zyl. Here come the Drago's! Celebrated in one of the most beautiful drawings on the board, but it says nothing about how he returns the stolen piece. Now that the jigsaw puzzle was complete the tattoo on Ivan's hand was no longer a reminder of what was missing but a symbol of what had been achieved. And we'll never know if it was thanks to the return of the jigsaw piece or because of the enormous success of the game the life of Ivan Drago and other games of course, what is certain is that Zyl regained its prosperity and became the city it once was. But the game only tells one part of the story, while the fanatics carry on playing beyond the last square the purists say that the real game is not the one with the illustrated board but rather the first game that Ivan devised for the contest, the empty page that the players complete with drawings of their own dreams. They say the true game of life is that blank page. Lets roll the dice again.
