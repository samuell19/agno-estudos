Based on Kaoru Kurimoto's novel, "lkidomari No Banka" Screenplay: Hiroshi Kashiwabara Director: Toru Murakawa BREAK OUT The phone's ringing. Hello? Where? Got it. I'm on my way. Can't turn it on? That time of the month... it's just like a woman. Heil, Hitler! Greetings, General! At ease! Every morning's the same. I can't stand this. Wait! Kaji, stop... - Ni hao. - Ni hao. You look tired. —- Because I don't get to exercise everyday. - Wait a second. What is it? Miss Saeko came by last night. I urgently need to talk to you. Please contact me. —- Saeko Miss Saeko came by last night. I urgently need to talk to you. Please contact me. —- Saeko I urgently need to talk to you. Please contact me. —- Saeko Women always appear at the wrong time. Women always appear at the wrong time. Would you like some acupuncture? — No thanks. —- It won't take long. - I've got work to do. —- You sure? Thanks a lot, bye. Hello, sir. Good morning. He made an emergency call but didn't survive. Good morning. What's the estimated time of death? Before you arrived. And you as well. I'm really unlucky. 1 applied for leave two months ago but now it looks like I have to cancel. It's tough being a civil servant. We should get two days off per week. He had no identification on him. Hey, everybody over here! Mr. Kaji. Mr. Kaji. Hey, Kaji! Where are you going? I'm in charge here, so behave yourself! Sakura, if information we'll collect for this case and the hotel murder are contradictory, you'll have to take responsibility. Okay? Don't go too far, Mr. Kaji. You'll only get yourself into trouble. If you want to suck up to Sakura, don't come along. Well, I don't want to go. But the chief told me to keep an eye on you. Then follow me. You might learn something. Sounds great. Please stop that. Stop. Are you deaf?! I'm warning you. What's he up to? Mr. Kaji, you're too violent! You'll be reported! You haven't changed at all. Some people will never change. I'm nothing compared to you. So... what are you here for? Yuko's customer list on the day she was murdered, and the hotel register. You should ask your department for it. I have... but its been tampered with. I want the original copy. Do you have a warrant? If 1 did, I wouldn't be here. Get out of here. Save yourself the medical expenses. Nakai. If you think you can do whatever you want, then you're mistaken. Can you have your own way in jail? Don't be so cocky. Mr. Kaji, the chief wants you. Take care of yourself, Kaji. A lot of people dislike you. Tell them to come find me anytime. Our precinct's the busiest in the force. We have to work from morning to night. Everyone's dog-tired. Want one? No thanks, I hate going to the dentist. Keep them for yourself. My daughter brought it back from Hawaii. Please work on this morning's case. What about the hotel murder? A young man surrendered himself. The case will be closed soon. Morning. How's it going? We're taking his statement. Good job. Do you think he actually did it? He surrendered himself, isn't that good enough? Wait a second. You know... criminals are getting younger and younger. Juvenile delinquency's a big problem. Did Nakai send him to take the fall? A lot of hotels and prostitution circles are run by Nakai's group. You should know that. And do you know... there's a letter from Nakai's lawyer right here? He's suing you for assault. This will affect your career. Forget about Nakai. Concentrate on this morning's case. What's this? An order from a superior? It's advice from a colleague. Besides, you don't like following orders. If it's advice, I'll take it. —- May I have one? - Sure. These will really ruin your teeth. I'm a carefree person. I'm off. Hey, Nishimura! Go with Kaji. Mr. Kaji, wait. Please... wait a second. I was looking for you everywhere. I found out something about the victim. He's a bass player? How did you know? I noticed the callous on his finger. Why didn't you say anything earlier?! This is why I didn't want to team up with you. Well, too bad. I'd like us to get along. I heard a guitarist at Club Dolphin looks like him. He's called Shimada. Dolphin? Welcome. Is Shimada here? The bass player. Shimada only plays on Mondays and Thursdays. What do you want him for? Do you recognize him? Has he been here? Are you a member, too? Isn't this a nice place? I heard your ex-wife designed it. We're looking for Shimada. It was Fukunaga's idea to get your ex to do the design. We see her name often in fashion magazines. I'm going. See you. Thanks. Who is she? A band member. She sometimes sings. What's so attractive about this place? - Sorry. —- Get on. Mr. Kaji. Wait. Sit tight. I want a quick word with you. Get off. Who are you? I'm a cop, alright? Kenji, come on. Hurry, let's go! They're called "Blood." A local bike gang. What is it? Mr. Kaji! Yes. That's correct. The victim's name is Kazuo Shimada. A musician. A bass player. Yes, I'm at the apartment. Alright, got it. Mr. Kaji... Is Sakura here yet? Excuse me. Mr. Kaji, wait. Hey! —- Keep an eye on everything. — Take care. Wait! Mr. Kaji! Get up! Get up! —- Mr. Kaji! —- Get up! Are you okay? A girl? How come? There's different types of girls. On your feet. Hey, you! What's your relationship with Shimada? You think silence is golden? You killed Shimada? A love triangle? He was a very popular musician. Did he have another girlfriend? That's bullshit! So you can speak after all. That's good. Where were you before midnight? Got an alibi? You think I killed him? Stop! Let go! —- Let me go! - 1 said stop! Hey, come here. Mr. Kaji, she's currently on probation for three counts of assault. Her name is Miki Sawano. She moved to Tokyo after graduating high school. Kept switching jobs. Then she met Shimada at Club Dolphin. Keeping quiet won't do you any good. Nishimura, get some coffee. Two, please. Do you think you can protect yourself by keeping quiet? Same as me. I learned the same thing when I was young. That's not all. Don't believe in others. I know you're afraid of something. I see... Shimada was the only person you trusted. Where were you after midnight last night? At Hama... Yokohama? I don't remember! What? We were riding on our bikes. You better cooperate. Heil, Hitler! What's wrong? Yes? Am I disturbing you? No. My friend just left and I feel lonely. Come over, I want to talk to you. Alright, but give me a couple of hours. Just wait for me. Okay, but you'd better come. 1 will. Really? Okay, then. It was ridiculous! What's wrong with you? Your face... I met a friend. It's a new way of greeting. No wonder your wife left you. Listen, I've got something to tell you. — A beer, please. - Alright. Are you really okay? It hurts, but it makes life more interesting. I want to talk about Yuko's murder. - Sorry to keep you waiting. — Thanks. You look fabulous today. Really? Gh, you're making me embarrassed. Thank you. Enjoy it. I heard a man named Kawano turned himself in. Yuko was a regular customer here. She came here the night she was killed. Someone called her and then she went to a hotel. She said it was the "old man" again. "old man"? Yes, she said he was a real pervert. A famous guy who wanted a quickie. Why did that Kawano guy surrender himself? Also, I heard a rumor... Nakai was seen at the hotel on the night of the murder. But listen, you're the only one I've told this to. What's going on? What are you up to now? Why are you still working on the hotel murder? Please. Please just let me do it. You don't have enough to go on! Just send my request upstairs. You'll make them angry and find yourself in more trouble. Don't lecture me, okay? Alright, I'll submit your request. But in the meantime, you'll focus on the Shimada case. Move it! We can't detain Miki Sawano much longer. Let's charge her with violent assault. We have to buy time. In the meantime, we'll check her alibi. Mr. Kaji! She's hiding something from us. If you don't charge her, then I'll report it. Mr. Kaji! Listen, Nishimura, this is my case. Keep out of it. This is my case, too! Let go of me! - Hi, babe. —- How's it going? - C'mon, join us for a drink! — Alright? - Let's go! Hey, what's wrong? C'mon, don't be scared of her. — Great! - Cool! Forget it, let's drink. Yes... yes... Can you check this number for me? Yes, thank you. Who the hell are you? Who the hell are you?! Bastard! Get off of me! Stop! So you like to bully women, huh? You asshole. Get out... or else I'll kill her. Try it. Let's see who's faster. Listen, don't try threatening me with her! Shoot, shoot! If you have the balls, then shoot! See, it's easy to scare his type off. That hurts! Why are you following me? To find out what you're hiding from us. He searched Shimada's place, and now yours, too. What is it about Shimada you're hiding? Answer me! I don't know anything! Get out. Get out now! You're coming with me... You're coming with me. You can tell me everything here. You'll be safe. Is that how you killed Shimada? Your hand's bruised. Sugar and cream? Sugar and cream? Yes or no? You know what? I've lost all interest in Shimada's death. Because I know you killed him. Drink up. I want to know about Nakai. What was the relationship between Shimada and Nakai? Answer me. What was it? You won't get away! Talk about bad timing. Hello? Got it, I'm on my way. Yes. Yes. Miki, you stay here for now. Lock the door. Don't let anyone in. If something comes up, stay calm. You can contact Wong on the 2nd floor. Hered™s his telephone number. Don't forget, you've just been attacked. Know what I mean? — Heil, Hitler! - 1 know. — Heil, Hitler! - I'm busy right now. Hey... Mr. Kaji. What is it? Take her to the station. Miki Sawano's the murderer. Mr. Kaji! — Heil, Hitler. - Greetings, General! At ease! I'm off, I'm off. What's his deal? Schizophrenia. Really? I'm convinced, Mr. Kaji. Her partner said she bought an army knife from a motorbike shop. The same knife used to kill Shimada. She's the murderer, understand?! I know where she's hiding. Don't worry. Well, then? Are you coming? Why don't you ever listen to me? You're so stubborn... Welcome. Welcome. Welcome. It's alright. Leave us alone for a little bit. You're here at last. This won't take long. I'm Nishimura. He's my partner. Tell me the whole story. One moment. I'm sure you know I did Dolphin's design. 1 was hired to do it, but the sofa and tables were all imported from Southeast Asia. Inside were... Drugs? That's what Nakai does. Later, he'll use that against you, and blackmail you to work for him again. Did he say anything else? No, but I'm worried. If he calls you, let me know. I'll try my best to help. Yes. Alright, then. Bye. Thanks a lot. Mr. Kaji! We must obey orders from upstairs. Nakai wouldn't leave behind any evidence. We have to talk to him. Don't worry, she's my ex-wife. You seem busy. As you can see, I've no time for you. Nakai. You were seen in the hotel the night Yuko was killed. You and another man came out the back. I was leaving my own hotel. Is that a problem? Hiding information is a serious offense. Helping a criminal escape is worse. —- Do have you any proof? - Sure. I've got what you're looking for. By the way, it's no use sending someone to get me. I won't be scared off. I don't do such stupid things. You shot your own father-in-law. When I think about my taxes being spent on people like you, I feel disgusted. Don't worry. You won't have to pay taxes for long. — Hey, are you feeling better? - Yes! Get out of my sight. Get out of my sight! Investigation Division. Kaji's out, who is this? I'm Kazumi, from the bar. Please get Kaji at once. This is very important. I know who was with Nakai that night. Seiji Tagawa. Seiji Tagawa? Yes, I'll tell him everything later. Please, get hold of him at once. I don't know when he'll be back. Sorry, we're not open yet. Hey... what are you doing? I said we're not open. What do you want?! Stop! I guess you don't need this now. He called you and said the man with Nakai that day was Seiji Tagawa. - Why didn't you tell me? — We're busy with the Shimada case! You'd have no time for a transvestite. You bastard! Sit down. That woman in the bar... or man... left a message, correct? Seiji Tagawa is a very wealthy Congressman. He killed the girl in the hotel. I believe that on the night of the murder he was at Nakai's hotel. Tagawa was meeting the girl there. Tagawa might have killed the girl by accident. - Does it feel good? —- Stop... stop... Regardless, he killed the girl. He was worried about his reputation so he asked Nakai for help. Nakai disposed of the evidence. Then they left through the back door. To Nakai, this was a blessing in disguise. He'd have dirt on Tagawa. As for Shimada... he was probably involved in disposing the evidence. Kaji. You can take a holiday. Why so nice to me? It's not like you. The prosecution has given us an answer. They want us to drop the hotel murder investigation. Why is that? Pressure from Tagawa? Why sacrifice when it won't do any good? Don't be a stubborn fool! If you want me to turn a blind eye to this, then you might as well fire me! disapproved of the way you work. But now I've changed my mind. I want to put Nakai away for good. Please let me help. Nishimura. You may regret it. You better not disappoint me. Welcome. Mr. Kaji, you like these things? No, it's for a guest at my place. A woman, huh? Miki Sawano. This way. Thanks. Well, isn't this nice? I do clean the place sometimes. Where is she? Miki! Miki! She must be bored stiff here. Miki! Not here? Hey, where's Miki? I don't know any Miki. You're lying. Hey, what do you want? Where the hell do you think you're going?! Keep out if you're smart. Shimada's recording tapes? He asked you to keep them for him. Oh right, over here. Here they are. This is it! Miki. You look good today. Yeah? —- What's in that tape? —- None of your business. Who are you? Who the hell are you?! Hey! You're gonna regret that. Miki! What happened?! What is it? What happened? Kenji... Kenji! Miki, what happened? Stay away. I killed Shimada. I killed him! Miki! Miki! —- Mr. Kaji! - Miki! Mr. Kaji! He's dead. I told you to take a long leave! The timing's terrible. Miki Sawano lied about her alibi, but you were hiding her. Now she's gotten away! And we have another dead body! Thanks to you we're all in deep shit! And your decision is? You stay at home and rest until this case is closed. That's all? Do you know what my boss said?! He wants you fired! 1 had to stop him! I owe you one. Kaji, listen. If you had resigned the last time... you and your wife wouldn't have separated. Leave your gun and badge here! Don't punish Nishimura. He knew nothing about Miki. I know! One more thing, Kaji. I didn't mean to mention your wife. Forgive me. Don't worry about it. I don't care how others look at me. Miyako! Hello? — This is Nishimura speaking. - So you're finally back. Working overtime? Who are you? I've rearranged your place a bit. Haven't you noticed? Who are you? Tell me! Dear... What are you going do to my wife? Don't shout. I'm not deaf. Tell me. What do you want with her? That will depend on you. What do you mean? I'd like you to do me a favor. Find out where Miki Sawano is. Then tell me at once. Once you do that I'll send your wife back. 32774661. Call me at this number. Don't forget it. It's a paging number. Under a false name, of course. What makes you think I'll do it? Stop! Alright. I'll do what you want. Who is it? It's me, Nishimura. 1 was just passing by. - Can I come in? - Yeah, sure. Want a beer? Thanks. You're off now? Not yet. But one drink doesn't matter. Good, you've made a lot of progress. All you cared about before was work. I could never get you to drink or chat. But that's not so bad. You don't want to end up like me, always drunk and messing things up. Mr. Kaji. What? - Nothing. - What? Nishimura, wait a little bit. I need a shower. That player last night was lousy. Did you see it? Pathetic. His balls can't hurt a fly. I can do better than him. Hey, Nishimura. Gone already? Congressman Seiji Tagawa Stop! What are you doing? Wait! You can't go in! Who are you? Mr. Tagawa. What was it like to strangle someone? You got over—excited and strangled that girl at the hotel. You went to Nakai to help destroy the evidence. Then you slid through the hotel's back door and sent someone else to take the blame. — Call the police! - Yes. Too bad. You can't hide forever. 1 know what you did. Listen up. Politicians aren't anything special. You're just an old man. Before I arrest you, I hope you don't kick the bucket. Hey, Miki! I'm sorry. Welcome, help yourselves. Thank you. Did you design this, too? I didn't realize you were so talented. Freedom can change a woman. It can change a man, too. How long? My beard? Well... Since the woman I love left me. Is that good or bad? Do you love me? Don't worry about Nakai. I'll get the evidence against him. You were just being used by him. You may be asked to make a statement, but you won't be charged. That's right. You weren't charged either, despite shooting my father. I'm sorry, I don't mean to blame you. But... if you had resigned then... What if I'd resigned? Things would have been different. I didn't finish with you last time, Kaji. Shall we go? This isn't a warning. I'm going to finish you off. Guns are boring. And I won't get the full satisfaction. Let's fight it out. Kill me! Shoot me! I don't want to dirty myself with any more of your blood! Do what you want yourself! Know what happened to the girl? What have you done with Miki? Listen to me. I... killed her. Investigation Division. A dead body?! Where? Understood. A dead body's been found in the engine room of a building. When did it happen? Nishimura, stay here. The head office may call. Yes. I have no place to go. You look good. What are you doing? Get out. Yes. Hurry up! Yes, understood. Sit down. I have a small request. This Wednesday, a friend's arriving from the Philippines. Let him go through with his luggage. No checking. Drugs? Yeah, that's right. It's easier it the order comes from a Congressman. Remember that night at the hotel? I helped you with the body. Nakai! If it weren't for me, you wouldn't have got away. You and I have to depend on each other. Right, Mr. Tagawa? I understand. But... this is the only time. I see. Shimada blackmailed Nakai about this. But why did you kill Shimada? I'm a singer in a band. Men are always trying to approach me. But they're just interested in my body. Shimada was different. I thought of him as a brother. But it didn't go as expected? I stabbed him after a misunderstanding. You're only the second person I've met who's different. What will you do with me? What will I do? I can't even help myself now. I just killed a man, too. Even so, something's got to be done. Investigation Division. It's me. Miki's with me. I've killed somebody. Nishimura, come and arrest me. Nishimura, are you listening? I understand. Who was it? My wife. Be careful. Don't become a slave to your wife. You'll go with Nishimura. Where are you going? I don't know yet. - Who is it?! —- It's me! Hurry up! Both of you, get out of here! Why? It's a gang. There's two cars right outside. Kaji, hurry up! Go! — What the hell? - Let's go! Hello, gentlemen. What do you want? I'll take care of the rest, Kaji. Thanks. It's no trouble at all. Bye. Bye. Mr. Kaji. It was me. I told them... where she was. They have my wife. Please forgive me. I'm not good enough to be a cop. Nishimura. When I was in the same situation, I gave up my wife. But you didn't. That's the only difference. I'm ashamed of myself. There's still something we can do. Are you coming? Search the surrounding area. Find any suspects. Miki, stay in the car. Nakai, where's Nishimura's wife? What are you talking about? Nothing yet. Hey! Stop! Come on! Where is she?! In the basement. Nakai. Nishimura, don't. Go. Go! You can't go against Tagawa and win. Be wise. We've covered all our tracks. But you couldn't fool me. You used me to kill for you? Don't shoot! Don't shoot me! Miyako! Dear! Take it. You were looking for this. I don't like quick-witted men. Stop! — Stop the car! — Stop! - Now! Taki.... Taki! Don't come near me! I'll shoot! One more won't make a difference. Drop the gun! Don't come near me! Drop it! Miki! Wait a minute. Mr. Kaji. Kaji... killed Nakai. — He did it to save my wife! —- Don't you know... he's trapped himself in a corner? You'll have to fix it. - Chief? - Shut up, just do it! He's no longer one of us! You have to clean up this mess. It's for your own good. Here's a special bulletin. The police have issued a warrant for a former police officer, Ryusuke Kaji, who's wanted for two deaths in Shinjuku. The suspect is currently on the run and is armed and dangerous. Residents are warned to beware and on the lookout. If you happen to spot this man contact the police at once. Relax. You're really nice. You're shy, aren't you? Nonsense, don't act stupid. Not me. No way. Yes, got it. Stop! Hey, do you hear me?! Stop! Stop! Stop right now! Stop! - Stop! - Stopi Hey, get out of the way! Sorry. Father! —- Move! — Father, what do we do? Move out of the way! I found some water, drink up. Don't go. Stay with me. I'm scared. Miki, don't worry, I'll think of something. Okay? You'll be just fine. Thank you for being so kind to me. But maybe you're just acting that way because I'm going to die. Stop that. You're not going to die. This may hurt a little. Bear with it. Thanks. —- What's going on? — We've searched already... Nishimura, forget Kaji. Let's go back. Search! Look over there. Mr. Kaji. Mister... Hello, children. Is there a clinic around here? —- 1 don't know. — Well, this hurts. - I don't know! Okay. Stop! Miki. Miki! What happened to Miki? What happened to Miki? When I came, she already... Turn yourself in. Nishimura, you think that's all? You're looking at a dangerous criminal. Is that all you should do?! I don't want to arrest you. I've killed two men. I liked... having you as a partner. Did you know that? I know. I've learned a lot from you. You have a sense of humor now. Hurts like hell. Nishimura. I have something for you. Here. Take it. You're sly. Mr. Kaji. Nishimura? Carry him away.
