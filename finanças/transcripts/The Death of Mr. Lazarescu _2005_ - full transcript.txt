Look at the light! It irritates you? It doesn't. Where do you hurt exactly? In the head. Put your hands up. All women are mean. Don't move and look me in the eyes. Squeeze my hands. Harder. Harder. Is that all? Get dressed. Call Papescu from Neurological. I will see you in a bit. Dragos, come here. It's an emergency. One 62 year old man. Get serious. I can't talk. If you bring me roses... I will be waiting. Let's see... Should he wear his jacket? Wait. A neurologist will see you. Let's see the cardiogram. You've got hypertrophy at the left abdominal side and high pressure. It's not serious, but you should rest yourself. Tell her doctor, she keeps ignoring me. You also got aorta blockage. We will leave, but first they need to check you. You should follow my treatment. You should pay a visit to your doctor once a month too. Salt, fat, coffee and alcohol are forbidden for you. You should go on a diet and you should not get stressed. We will go on vacations at a spa. Shall this be good? We said she should rest. Not that she shouldn't do anything at all. We have been celebrating 40 years of marriage. We wanted something special. The new patient? - Did you bring me roses? - I couldn't find. Take an apple. It's like telling me "je t'aime, moi non plus". He has headache in the right side. He has arthritis and he drank. X-ray in 3 hours. We are full now. The surgery looks like a slaughterhouse. He has a liver problem. He has to have an x-ray. In three hours. - Your name? - Lazarescu Dante Ramus. What do you have Mr. Lazarescu? Headache since this morning. - Are you hurt? - He fell in the shower. I'm not hurt, I just slipped. Say what I say. Thirty three geraniums on the roof. Say, orange. Do you feel the same here? Follow my finger. With your eyes. - You see clearly or blurry? - Clearly. Relax your eyebrows. Catch your nose with your left index, just like me. Now with the right hand. Squeeze my hands. Put your hands up. Close your eyes. Open your eyes. Bend both your knees now. Get up and walk. He can't. Tell me what you did this morning. I woke up at 6. - I woke up with a headache. - You woke up with a headache? - Did you take any drug? - Distonocalm. Saturday morning, I got back. I went to the market to take some seed. What seed? He gave me grass for pansy. I went back to take my money. It was the man with the moustache. What's that? - How we call it... - You ask me? How do we call the thing I wear in my hand. You know. Why do you ask me? - What's that? - A writer! You found him in the bathroom? When I arrived, one neighbour was helping him get out. I don't know what to do... I want brain tomography. It might be haematoma. Might be something else. They sent him here for an x-ray, and for blood test. They sent you for nothing. X-ray is full. Come back in 3 hours. It's full. We work non-stop. You might need to get operated in the brain. To remove a thrombosis. Do you understand me? Lazarescus blood test results. He should have an x-rayl to find out what his problem is. He can't wait. Get him to Filaret. They have got an x-ray. Take a look at that. See the potassium and glucose levels. Go to Filaret. Stop joking! Does it hurt? I will inform the guy at the axial. It will take me some minutes. Wait some time. You will take an x-ray. - I am not a coward. - What did you say? I am not afraid of the surgery. Routine operation. Like appendicitis. I was operated for ulcers, and I am not afraid. That is going to be simpler. Bombs hit the home and the floor. Have you been in the war? In '44, Americans raided Ploiesti. Bucharest and Brazi. We have been there too. Me and Evelin made it. Do something. There is a patient that needs to make an axial. And then? Brain and liver. If I tell you he's my relative? I do it for Jina. It might be haematoma or neoplasia. Thank you. You are a good friend. Tell Breslaslu that I sent you. Dragos Papesku. The patient is sleeping. - What are you doing Bubulina? - What are you waiting for? I want a Colebil. My bile hurts. I got a job for you. I will be right there. Duty calls. - Won't you go for the axial? - I have an emergency situation. I don't have time. - Where is the x-ray? - Won't we keep him here? If it's a haematoma he's going to Filaret. Surgeries are full of the bus accident victims. Maybe they are empty now. Don't look for trouble. My pen! Continue and make sure you don't lose the nurse. Good morning. - November 19th. Scorpio? - Just like my brother. You don't have to wait for the rest of the tests. Axial is on the 4th floor. The guys know where. Next. Bye. - Where are you going? - I can't get up. Do you know where we are? We will make an x-ray. You are a nice woman. Yes, relax now. - Do you need me? - You can go. Is he coming with Virgil? Is he coming with Virgil? - Who is him? - Virgil Muscalu. I don't follow you Mr. Lazarescu. Eva's second husband. With the fast train? Oh my god. What did I do wrong? If you keep talking I will bind your tongue. - Are you working now? - Fortunately, I got you. Will you help me with a patient? I have been with him since 10. - You don't work in emergency? - That's where I have been working. Don't move please. I brought him for x-ray. Popescu talked with the doctor. - I'm going to tell him. - Take this too. Everything is going to be fine. - We will see the x-ray. - It's my wife in there. Doina gave you an invitation? Reception at Intercontinental! - Too expensive. - Her daughter is lucky. Her father-in-law is senator of the social democrats. - Big deal! - It's not small... - You should brush your hair. - Dress is not ready yet... - I have shadows of dark rings under the eyes. - When is your son getting married? - I don't know. He decides. They are in love, so it's like they are married. I don't see my grandchild regularly. I don't have a good relationship with my daughter-in-law. You are fine. How do you make it? - I am on a diet. - You are married, aren't you? I thought you were a feminist. - Will you open miss? - Just a second. Good evening. Are you the uncle of Dragos mother-in-law? Did he take tests? The sir drunk tonight! Of course! With Sauvignon! - Your name? - Lazarescu Dante Ramus. Louder. Give me the paper. You got a big name. We will take a photo of you. You have something here and here. That's what the test results indicate. We will finish fast. One of the brain and one of the liver. - Do you hurt now? - My stomach is swollen. - What does he say? - His stomach hurts. We took him with nausea and headache. Neighbour said he was spitting blood. He may have eaten tomatoes. - How did he know it was blood? - That's what he said. Let's put him in. Don't worry. You got any metal objects on you? We will lose the belt. - Will we put him in the hospital? - Let's finish with the x-ray first. If you don't stop moving, the picture will be blurry. If you want to say something, talk to the microphone. I am freezing... Run, to get hot. Did you give him glucose? He was weak. We gave him a counterpain too. - And in St. Spiriton. - Then, let's give him more. Doctor, he pissed on himself. I want to go to the toilet. Don't get anxious or you're going to shit on yourself. You pissed on yourself. We will take the picture and we will change your clothes. I want pajamas. First the picture, then pajamas. Take a look at me. We will go to the toilet, but first we will take the picture. Nurse, I want to take a bath. - You got clothes to change him? - I got his pajamas. Help her change him. What do you have on your legs? You didn't say you got varices. Did you keep that for a surprise? Don't be ashamed. You are not the first one. Pull your leg up. Stop whining. Just a second, doctor. Ready! Watch your head. You are ready. You pissed on yourself, we changed you and we gave you your pajamas. Keep it until we are done. - Your papers. - It's Lazarescu's. Close the eyes and don't move. I had a bag somewhere around here. The big one. Mariana, bring frapuccino for me and the lady. Sugar? What do you say Mr. Lazarescu? The image is going to be blurry. Don't move! 6... 5... 4... 3... We start with the head and we stop to the Stalingrand. The coffees, doctor. We are done with the head. If he takes antithrombotic pills for the varices, he's dead. Let's continue. Mariana, put him in position for x-ray of the abdominal region. We are done with the head. We will take a picture of the abdominal region. Did you hear what I said? Help me move him. Are you ok? We're almost done. Bend over. Your hands over your head. Hold him. We will tie them. Close your eyes. The doctor was right. Neoplasia! He deserves congratulations. I said he was suffering from cancer too. Don't pretend to be a doctor. You gave him glucose. I am just kidding! At this situation, it wouldn't make any difference if you gave him compote. He's breathing his last gasps. It will take some time. Mariana take him out. Take the pictures and go to the neurosurgery. Got it. Neurosurgery. Mariana, a patient is waiting. Go to Floreasca. Or Bagdashar. He must have an operation immediately. - Didn't they give you a referring? - For Filaret. Is he from the bus accident? They brought him from the emergency. - He must have an operation immediately. - Will you keep him here, doctor? There is no free bed. - Can we help? - They put me in the middle! Surgery and neurosurgery are both full. He must have an operation in Filaret, and die in his home. You think if I could, I wouldn't keep him? It's emergency! He must have the operation now! Where will we take him doctor? Brain haematoma with skull pressure. - You will owe me. - lf you manage anything... And the other? Got it, thanks. Damn. Surgeries are full till 1 o'clock. Give him plaster. Shall I send him to the crematory? He is freezing. Neurosurgery is full. Give me the papers to sign. All the night I have been with him. You exaggerate. It's still morning. I thought it would help, if you talked with the neurosurgery. He might die on the road. Take a look at the x-ray. Here, Mioara. Don't move if you want to feel better. If you want to throw up, tell me first. In the past, when you were angry you were telling me. Bastard. What does he say? I don't understand. 500.000 for the drugs. 500 more for the visit. X-ray, 2.000.000. And more money for the hospital. - I am thirsty... - You're avoiding my question. It's the ambulance too... Fuel, service. I am thirsty. My bile hurts again. Think of the bus driver. In the end, there are 11 dead people. - I got water. - Give me. You don't want to marry? You like bachelor life? I split a year ago. - You were married? - I got a 2 year old daughter. You and your generation! You are divorced... ...my son has a son without being married! We do what we can! My son has a daughter too. Michaela. I call her Micka! I didn't know you were married! - What's the name of your daughter? - Janina. Beautiful name. She is beautiful too. She has my eyes. Sorry to mention this... ...but you shouldn't split. For the child. Good evening. I brought a patient from the Universal hospital. Bring him in. Wait. He is coming now. Relax. He won't be late. What is he suffering from? Haematoma. He must go to the neurosurgery. He has pissed on himself. I know. We have been hanging in various hospitals. Why did you piss on yourself? Belly... between us. I don't understand you. Are you done? Check his pressure. You have pissed on yourself. You have a cold hand. We 're coming from the Universal hospital. They were full from the bus accident, and they sent us here. He is throwing up and he has headache. Wouldn't it be better to stay there? They only have one room in the neurosurgery. - They have 2 rooms. - I think they have only one. You should go to Bagdashar. He is right. Don't you know it? He has to be operated now! Mr. Lazarescu do you hear me? You know where you are? Look at me. Follow the pen with your eyes. - When did he begin to lose it? - It the third hospital. At St. Spiriton they told us to make an axial. And from the Universal hospital they sent us here. Where do you live? - You live in Bucharest? - The lady from the emergency... We can't talk... He has liver cancer and he has to be operated now! - Can I check him? - Here are the test results. If you got a problem, get out and let me work. I am sorry but more patients are waiting for the ambulance. Pulse 110. You don't know that you should wait at the hospital? I have been doing this job for 16 years. Shall I dress him up? How do you know he has cancer? Did you do a biopsy? He has unusual structure. Do you know what this means? You know how it is called in medical words? Biopsy will tell if he has cancer. Thanks for the lesson. I need to scratch my back. Tests are clear. See his folder. It's 3 in the morning. We are tired. You will do your job, and we will do our job. And stop insulting me. You feel better? - Who did you come with? - My bride groom. Your bride groom can take you at home. - Can we be fast? - Don't you have anything else to do? Did you fill in his form? The nurse is waiting for you to fill them! Are you going to blame me? Don't talk to me like that. I got a child at your age. You think you know everything. Maybe you have got a Nokia charger? It smells awful in here. Open a window. It is broken doctor. Doesn't this smell irritate you? - What is he suffering from? - Haematoma in brain. He smells. Why didn't you clean him up? He pissed himself on our way here. He has to be operated as soon as possible. Laura, you got a Nokia? Just like this one here? Can you give me your battery? I want to wake up my wife, so she can catch the train. - Call from mine. - No, I just need the battery. I won't talk much. - The nurse taught us a lesson. - I said he needs to be operated. Are you the one to decide or the doctor? Mr. Breslasu said this. - And what is he? - A specialist. Your identity card. No signal. I will call later. - Who is with him? - Me. Doesn't he have any relatives? Wife, sister, lover? His sister will come. Be careful. Now we will take care of you. I'm Dr. Mirica, neurosurgeon. The x-ray indicates a brain haematoma. That's why your head hurts and you throw up. - It's because of the ulcer. - From the haematoma, not the ulcer. It's normal. Vomiting might be because of the liver too. My head and my belly hurts. You are fine, but don't talk because I can't understand you. You're not in a coma. You just need sleep. Just like me. It's 3:35am. - You got relatives? - I got ulcers. I told you. He has a sister and he must have an operation. That's what Mr. Breslasu said. I think the doctor exaggerated things. You don't respect us at all. I said we should rush. We have been around since 10. Let us do our job just like we know. You asked me to go outside. We are all medical stuff. With different quality. You can't tell a doctor what to do. This is rude. If you want to stay, don't talk. Otherwise, wait in the hall. Sign and I'll leave. - What did you say? - Sign and I'll leave. The doctor decides. I say it once again. You will shut up and let me do my work... ...or you will go outside. You've got a brain haematoma and you need surgery. Bring a statement... We will operate you... ...but you should state that you take all the risk. - Do you know what haematoma is? - I've got a bruise. - What did you say? - I've got a bruise. Right, a broken vessel. It's pressing the brain. If we don't operate you, you will die. The operation is dangerous and I have to warn you. Some other doctors don't do it. Patient should know. It's too risky. You must be serious. You might die. It's like appendicitis. There is a danger of paralyses. I don't want to be paralysed. Who said you will? There is just a chance of. That's why the patient signs. Look at me. You drank. You smell alcohol. We will operate you, but you should sign first. Say it again. I didn't hear you. In Christmas, Bianca will come. Don't worry, 'til Christmas you will be fine. Let's go to the surgery room, but sign first. Eva will come with her husband. Look. Doctor will take care of you. You should sign. Sign so that we can operate on you! Got it? You should sign! Mr. Lazarescu that's the statement. I have written your name. Sign on it, to show you agree. I will help you. Take the pen and sign. - I don't want to be paralysed. - You won't. Sign! Mr. Lazarescu, will you sign? What are we going to do doctor? Will you sign to go to the surgery? He can't sign. He can't hold the pen. And we will break the law? And I will go to the jail? If he doesn't sign and he dies, I will go to prison. Sign, I will operate on you, and tomorrow you will be fine. I want drugs from my home. I can't understand what you're saying. You want to go to your home? Will you come to my home? Relax, if you don't want to sign, we won't push you. Did you copy him in our files? Now give him a release card. Patient refused operation. - He should sign. - He doesn't want to. In my folder I mean. He can't think straight. The signature doesn't count. Say that you don't want to operate on him and we will leave. - Where will you get him? - At Bagdashar. Or at the Universal hospital. They won't have too many people now. Sorry, but I know when a patient can't think. Now you will fight with the doctor too. You know something. You go around with the ambulance for an hour... ...'til he falls into a coma so we can do the surgery. We won't need neither signature nor relatives. He didn't sign and I can't operate him. You know from laws and medics, find him a hospital then. The patient didn't sign so it's not my responsibility. Go to Bagdashar to find a doctor. ...who will operate him without signing. If he dies in ambulance, you are to be blamed. I don't want. - What? - I don't want. Nurse, take him from here. First decide what you want and then you know where to find me. Call them to take him. What are you looking at? Go to Bagdashar. Mr. Lazarescu will we go to Bagdashar? I am going to take a croissant. Do you want anything? - He doesn't smell anymore. - I can't hear you. - What did you say? - I can't hear you. The old man doesn't smell anymore. Will you let us pass? I will take his folder. Good morning! - I brought a patient. - Tell that to the head nurse. That's his folder. We come from Filaret. He has pissed on himself. Shall we bring him in? - How are you? - How are we? We were busy with the accident, but now we are better. What did you give him and he smells like that? - Is he drunk? - He has pissed on himself. We should wash him. Mrs. Zamfire should see him. Let me see. He has a brain haematoma and must have an operation. The x-ray doctor. - Is that a thrombosis? - Brain bleeding. - It's not that serious. - Might be. It's serious enough. This shadow in the liver is serious. I'm afraid it's incurable damage. What's your name? Can you repeat? Lazarescu Dande Remus. I didn't understand he said this. Why didn't they keep him in Filaret? He didn't want to sign for the operation. It's in his folder. I can see this, but I don't think that Mr. Lazarescu understood. Don't tell me that he got worse while he was transferred here. It's 10 minutes away. It took us more time. Till we take him in and out of the ambulance... It took us half an hour... - Are you the driver? - Yes. - Sit and relax. - Thanks, I will stay here. - Is he going to neurosurgery? - Yes. Did you sign him up? - Is anyone else with him? - He has one sister. She will come today at 6 o'clock. So he is alone. I can't understand why they didn't keep him in Filaret. Dos you show them the axial? Of course I did but the patient didn't sign. No one will ask him for his sign now. Call the surgery! - Why is he so quiet? - We are almost done. We had drug addicts, drunks. Don't worry. Give me Angel. They brought us wounded people from the accident. Tough night. Are you done? He can go? Ask the people to get him to the surgery. I'm sending you someone with haematoma. He came from Filaret. - Is he accompanied? - He has one sister. She will come at 6 in the morning. He is in bad condition. He can't communicate. 62 years old. I don't know if he is an alcoholic, but he did drink some. At the left temple. If I don't send him now, I will never send him. Can you sign? Clean him and shave him for the operation. When he is ready get him to Mr. Angel. Thanks. Good night. Wait! I am losing it. Give this to Angel. Where are you going? You are finished. They have our stretcher. We get him to the surgery take the stretcher and we leave. - We don't have stretchers? - They are in the surgeries. - We will just take him up there. - We won't be late. Don't forget the papers. Can I pass? They will operate you and you will be fine. Don't move. Put him here. Watch his head. Mr. Lazarescu's clothes. I'll pull this out and we can leave. Shave him fast please. What a night again, with this accident. Can you? They drive and they don't think of the others. I am going to have a cigarette. Only 3 out of the 14 are a little better. God help them. Just like the war and the '77 earthquake. - Is the driver alive? - I don't know who the driver was. Two more days like these and I will need a hospital too. I am done miss Mioara. Good night. Watch his legs. He has varices. What have you done? What's wrong with your legs? Cover him. Bring me the alcohol. You are done, pretty! He is ready, Virgil! Take him to Angel!
