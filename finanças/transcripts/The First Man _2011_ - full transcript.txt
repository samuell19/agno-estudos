What name did you say? Cormery. It is a relative? My father. Cormery Henri ... ... wounded in the Battle of the Marne ... ... died October 12, 1914. I was six months old when he died. It does not change anything, the dead are always too many. But where are the dead of '14? In row C, D or P? Sorry, I'll check. 25 years ... My father is 25 years old. - Did you miss Algiers alot? - A little over a year. It's changed a lot. - I've got some news. - No, thank you. I've already read the forecast. Rain tomorrow, that's summer in Algeria. Your last interview has caused much discussion. Someone is ambiguous your positions. We were very impressed one sentence: "The writer will never reach the height of the one who dies. " You know the way to Belcourt? - This is my neighborhood. - Let's go directly to the university. - And then we take you to the hotel. - Why to the hotel? It is not prudent that you to sleep at home tonight ... ... nor any other nights, if you stay in Algiers. - It's not safe? - A simple precaution. To avoid endangering even your mother. I am Fran?ois Husson, I write for "L'Echo d'Alger." She said that the policy does not care ... ... but today, in Algeria, everything is political. What is the question? Are you a man of the right or left? Go back to your house, Cormery! We do not need people like you, you traitor! - You're not welcome here! - Come on, it is best to enter. Renegade! Long live French Algeria! Long live French Algeria! It is believed that the university forms the best of a country ... ... it is the temple of learning ... ... but instead of reflecting, an insult to the people ... ... behave as provocative. Fortunately, considering the time, it is an isolated minority. Today we have enemies. - A very large minority, I think. About to end, then it's up to you. There was no need that the blood of the French ... ... flowed in the streets and the houses of Algiers ... ... to open our eyes to the truth. There is no time for compromise. Now the policy must have only one goal ... ... respond to the killers with their own weapons. Now we have the honor to welcome someone ... ... that needs no introduction. We greet you with a warm round of applause Jacques Cormery! Thank you. Good morning everyone. The last time I came in this room, I was still a student. I used to sit there, the last row. Yes .. So much time has passed and many things have changed, is it not so? For a new Algeria ... There is an argument more important to us ... ... here and now this? Nothing I love more that the fate of our country. You are no longer Algerian! Algeria is not France ... ... and it is no longer Algeria. Algeria is this forgotten land, denied, distant, despised ... ... with its Arab mysterious its exotic and French ... ... that is left to stifle in its own blood. Algeria is this area ... ... inhabited by two peoples, one of which is Muslim. Not for long! It accepts too easily ... ... the idea that only the blood can move the story ... ... but the duty of a writer ... ... not to be of service of those who make history ... ... but to help those who suffer it. I strongly believe ... ... the possibility of a just coexistence between Arabs and French in Algeria. And that such coexistence between free and equal people ... - ... today is the only solution. - Algeria is French! I thought I was outted by certain controversy ... ... I was wrong. Do not worry, I do not run any risk. You rather, how do you feel? No, not yet, I'm going to see her tomorrow morning. Do not worry, I'll call you. No, I do not forget. Good night. The lady there. She went to the market. - Thank you, Said. - Welcome home, Mr. Jacques. - Thank you. - Do you want to wait here? No, I face. Mr. Jacques ... It is true that there is a war between us? Here, her. Mom! Lady Cormery! I thought you were coming yesterday. I had prepared the stew and chicory. They eat today. - It is not the same the next day. - Forgive me. You will refer back tonight or tomorrow. How long this time remains? All the time you want. I saw the picture of the baby. Now that is great not like you anymore. It is the portrait of his mother. He's fine, his mother? Highs and lows, as always. He needs regarded. It is a serious illness, his. - What do they call? I never remember. - Depression. You do not have a fever ... ... you're always tired ... ... and you no longer want to live. Thank God you're okay. I have not yet said how beautiful you are. I'm old. Yesterday I had arranged her hair and look how small ... They are wonderful your hair. Now let's take a walk and then I'll take you to the restaurant, okay? - Later on, let's stay here for a while. ' - All right. Look. Buy the papers now? I can not read, but my son I admit. The picture is beautiful, no? You're still poking around? What are you looking for? My father's name was Henri and nothing else? - He had no other names? - I do not know, I do not remember. Like me? His eyes were clear, like you. Once you told me who had lost his father as a child ... ... and that had put him in an orphanage. Not even he could read. They do not learn anything in orphanages. But I sent postcards from the front. Then he learned. When he was twenty, I think. I can not remember, are ancient history. But when we got married, could do every job. He had brains, your father. Like you. And after that? You came along. And then died in the war. They sent me a piece of shrapnel. It's in the cookie jar. Are not you tired? Go and lie down on the bed. I put clean sheets. I'm glad when you get back. Where are you going? Go back to bed! Go back to bed! Come on, get rid of the dogs! Open! Come on, open up! Open! Dumb! You smell like dog! Please, sir, let me out! I had nothing! It was them! Let me out! Let me out! It was not me! Lord, let me out! Do not go away! Let me in, let me out! Piece of shit! Moron! Bastard! Fool! Nasty nasty! - Come with me. - Bring him here. This is the time to go home? Where are your new sandals? I lost them. I searched everywhere, but I have not found. If so, you'll be barefoot all summer. And you? What are you doing there impaled? From 'a hand to your brother ... ... that has toiled throughout the day. But first, take me what you need for your child. Close the door. Approached. Approached. Strong blow ... ... biggest lie. Out of here ... out of here! Eat. So they give it to the sick the first pavilion. The rich. There was a gentleman there outside. A gentleman? It is always there when I come to find. Qggi gave me a smile. I think I know. And if you know me, know you too, right? What are you saying? At school I told you're a nurse. If you learn to read, You can become a nurse, right? The drugs have difficult names. - But I recognize. - How? By color. And I do as well stings. Hurry up ... ... your grandmother gets upset if you come back later. The grandmother beat you too when you were little? He beat me forever. But you do not ever hit me. If your father were here ... I'm afraid to make you cry. - Who are the poor? - The poor? Yes, who are they? It's us. I, you ... ... grandmother, uncle Etienne. If we are the poor ... ... then all is well. There stomach hurts? You want a bit 'of water? - I did not do my homework. - Neither do I. But I am the master. - Is it serious? - Yes. - Do you remember what was there to study? - You had to learn Napoleon.

It seems that you have become rich and powerful. - Neither the one nor the other. - And a liar, like all the French. Algeria are like you. I know you have two children. A nine year old boy and a small five. I have only one child. God did not want to give me more. I wanted to study ... ... but he prefers use your hands instead of your head. - Maybe he's right. - He's 18 years old, is a bricklayer. He's a good boy, my son. And you, Hamoud, how are you? I need you, Mr. Cormery. If I can. In the name of that friendship that there has never been. - I had respect for you. - I do not. - You called me "Femminella." - I beg your pardon.

His version is not far-fetched, but the court rejected this argument. The condemned to death ... ... without any concrete evidence he wanted to kill. The request for clemency will be filed, but the release is unlikely. You can write a letter the Minister of Justice ... ... to ask him to review the case. Fran?ois Mitterrand certainly try to do something. Even he accepts injustice, you can be sure. And then ... ... with your reputation ... Hey you! Give me a bit 'of money if you are a man. I did not expect. - Can I get you something. - No, do not worry. I made you the roast peppers, I put them in the fridge. So are good. - Are you okay? - Yes. As a child I used to say that I was too smart to stay here ... ... I had a duty to go. Everything I have made good I owe it to you. If you're happy ... ... enough for me. In North Africa, France has a magnificent empire ... ... composed of three countries: Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia. The conquest made to avenge a blow range of the Ambassador of France ... ... began in 1830. The indigenous, nomadic Arabs and the Berbers sedentary opposed a fierce resistance. Do not forget the famous Barbary pirates. Their incursions sowed death among indigenous tribes. It was the providential intervention of the French to save them. The French have built roads, railways and bridges. They have developed agriculture, mines, waterworks ... ... hospitals and schools. Nowadays the Algeria ... ... divided into three departments from 1848 ... ... is a province of France ... ... and enjoy the splendor cultural and universal of France ... ... our homeland. Now it is the turn of Cormery Jacques. Cormery. Then, Cormery ... ... I say you are a poet. I? No. I know you have written a poem. I copied. You stole a companion? No, three different poets.

Our house no longer exists. Why so many questions? Would you be happy If I wrote a book about you? I can not read. I always smoke alone. A cigarette is better with friends. Thank you. It 's true. You're right. When you ask or offer a light ... ... is established complicity between people. I never thought of that. Put it in your own book: Uncle Etienne said ... - But why did you give me of you? - Respect. What are you saying? And what are you doing in a place like this? Nice, eh? Toilets cleaned. - You're not invalid. - I no war. Too young, too old. I next party! - I love you. - Stop ... Enough of this you. Your books here in the library. "Last strike" beautiful. You know how heavy fatigue. You know better than I, 've worked all my life. No, one day he wanted more. Enough said. Are you tired, I understand. Me too the war. Alone. You think I'm happy? Has not changed, innocent as ever. - It was day or night? - What? When I was born, I bet it was sunny. It was night and raining. The opening with your book? What do you think? I do not think anything. Do not forget to tell the truth about your father. Write this: My father was more handsome than me. Help me, my wife is in labor! - And what is the problem? - Is there a doctor near here? The doctors do not understand anything, there are women for this. A?cha! Adila! Fadela! Zohra! Come! Log. God wanted to spoil. - It's your first child? - Yes. The first. Do you think I have nothing else to do? Kheira! Kheira! Take it. I'm sorry to keep you waiting. I have a little lamb who does not want learn of his mother's milk. It is I who thank you for the time that you steal. This is the farm that interests you?

My parents have redone entirely. Do you think they knew my father? Maybe, many years have passed. You know when they get here the first settlers? In 1848. Right. The year in which France has allocated 50 million to finance a colony. Imagine success. Were more than a thousand volunteers to dream of the promised land. The men especially, women are more wary. But men ... ... It is no coincidence who had made the revolution. It is almost nothing, something? If you are Algerian, you know how things go. You throw it down and rebuild. Think about the future and you forget the rest. Excuse me, I have bothered at all. No, I'm glad to have met you. I read one of your books. I do not remember the title, but it was nice. - Your parents still live here? - No. My father does not want to hear about Algeria. Lives in Marseille, in a modern apartment. It seems to pass the days at home doing nothing. And you? I will stay here until the end ... ... go as he goes. Creper? here. They are not capable of understanding these things in Paris. And you know who are the only ones, apart from us, who can understand it? - Arabs. - Exactly, we are made to speak. They are so stupid and as rough as we ... ... but they still have our blood. Then, we will continue for a while to slaughter us ... ... to tear the guts in torture ... ... and then we shall be restored to live as human beings. Yesterday morning a boy died. She was twenty, he was the son a classmate of mine. His name was Aziz Abdheramane. He was guillotined. Have never tried his guilt ... ... and now I feel closer to him ... ... that all those French Algeria who speak without knowing. I've never met, but I know his father ... ... and is not hatred I saw in his eyes ... ... but the despair and pain ... ... a pain that I agree with him. His face is that of my country. The victims of the Algerian tragedy belong to a single family ... damn ... whose members massacred in the middle of the night without recognizing ... ... groping in the dark and throwing himself into a fight blind. Algeria will soon be populated only victims and murderers ... ... and only the dead are innocent. I have always been and continue to be right for an Algeria ... ... where everyone can enjoy the same rights in law. You need to make the Algerian people what is due to him ... ... and give more fully democratic. We must unite instead of divide. But as I always condemned terrorism ... ... so condemn the actions of senselessly in the streets ... ... and that one day may strike someone dear to us. I believe in justice. And I say to the Arabs: I will defend it at all costs ... ... but never against my mother ... ... because she has been injustice as you ... ... and suffering. And if in your anger, shall ye evil ... ... I will be your enemy. It is beautiful the grave? The grave of your father. I have not seen it yet. But now you come back with me, we'll go together. I'm old, far away. Why do you want to stay here? She is beautiful France, but there are no Arabs. You do not like? Yes, a lot. The weather is changing. Yes. There come off the light this winter? I think not.
