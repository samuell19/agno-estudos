Any word from Sully? Not yet. Alright. Have everything ready when he calls, right. And make sure Eddy is clear with him, its our weed. If we grow 200 plants I expect 200 plants. Ah, he knows, the prick is edgy as it is. We don't need to freak him out even more. Fuckin' Sully. Have the lads meet us at your mum's place, I'll be there in 30 minutes. Where are ya now? I gotta go see Tex about something. Do you know this dopey cunt? Yeah. Is there anybody looking for this dopey cunt? Not that I know. Well that's good, that's good, but its not good for you. What did he steal this time? He stole somebodies eye. I heard about that, Burt's kid? Yeah, that's Burt's kid. What he's like 17, mouthy little fucker. Seeing is believing. Burt's paid me up front for... three days? Burt's left it up to me to decide what an eye is worth. Ya know... money, drugs, all that, all that there shit that can be... can be settled, its payable. But you see an eye, an eye is difficult to put a price on. Do you like the smell of money? Like the smell? You know Cyril called me? Oh yeah, what did he want? He wants his fucking money. I've got two months. Hmm. I just wanted to give you a wee... just a wee heads up. He'll get his money. - Where ya growing the weed? - I have a place. Oh, you have a place, do ya? That's good... That's good innit? Ya know... Ya know, now might actually be the right time to go after him, you know with his... his wife dying of cancer. Ya know, I heard he is doing all these dealings with these weird people. Who? I dunno, weird people. No wait, um, its holistic people, holistics. Ya know, cause he's, uh, he's trying to get rid of his wife's cancer. Speaking of cancer... Don't you fucking move. Where do you want me to start? - Climpy. - Climpy? The boyfriend? Well how nasty? Nasty. Do you want me to break bits or take bits? Break. I want to know everything where he went, what he saw, everything. Get out. Now Ellen would not make us sit outside. Yeah we talking about the same Ellen, the one who burned all my stuff but kept the TV? - You loved that TV. - Yeah. Maybe you should be more worried about your kid. She'd have made us breakfast, too. Yeah... No, your fucking kidding me. Yeah right. We can't use Sully's place, he thinks the cops are onto him. Paranoid prick. Let's go. Ellen, that's not what you said. Hang, hang on a minute. Ellen. Let's get this over with. Where is he? Upstairs. Hurry up! I hear your looking for a grow room. Nah. Really? Where's the money? Relax. I've a handy room upstairs, perfect for growing. I said no. I thought we were buddies? You're scum, Gary. Sorry to hear about Hannah. Oh! What was that about? Gary's a scumbag but we need him to buy from us. Let's go see Ellen. Tidy those toys away. What ya looking at, bird boy? You, fat face. Your a drunk and I don't want Sarah hanging around with a drunk. And its okay for her to be around you? I'm sober. You were never sober. I am sober. - Just like that. - Yeah, just like that. Don't walk away from me. Your child is inside there watching ye. Is she still looking? Yeah. Hug her. Fucking do it! Tell Joe he can have Sarah this weekend. No. - Are you off the sauce? - Yeah. Are you gonna mess this up? No. You heard him. And if he does, he can deal with me the next time he wants her. Put the child first for once ye cunts. Come on gimme a hug. Next weekend, yeah? Thanks. Don't thank me yet. If she goes with him, I'll be alone. I don't like to be alone. Or Sarah stays here and I don't care what you do. Okay, but if you tell him. What's he gonna do? Last night. Went to this pub, was chatting this young one up. Old fella at the counter kept saying, "Go way, stop talking to her." So I says to him, "What's it to you?" The man at the counter says, "She's my daughter your barred." So I leaves. He finds this motor bike. He finds the helmet. Puts the helmet on. Had to put the cat down last week. It couldn't really walk or see, it was deaf as a post. Tried explaining it to the wife, but she is as deaf as the cat. So I wrote it down for her. When you have to put your thoughts down on a page, you think about them a lot more and you really focus on what it is you wanna say and... Its like stepping through a doorway in your head. What I wrote down for her was a basic sentence, there was no poetry to it, but it was... the most honest heartfelt thing I could write for her. This is for you and your friends. Now fuck off. I always figured I'd tell her about you, but what's the point? That would only upset her. Your mother never told your dad about you, did she? That was good of her, I guess. He wouldn't have wanted ya. Some people own their mistakes. Some don't. I didn't own you. So lets her it. We fell short. I'm aware of that. People die. A month is plenty of time to get it out of your system. Number eleven Oakfield. The attic is a good spot for the crop. Your friend Climpy goes there. Now fuck off. My wife tells me every day not to worry. That the lord is like a river. Constant. Always moving. Taking us to somewhere new. My dad's buried in there. Your dad's dead? When did that happen? About three months ago. Why didn't you tell us? He was in the ground before I knew. We didn't get on. I thought you were adopted. My adoptive dad. Not so bad so. Twat. This guy. Cyril said there is an abandoned house on Oakfield, said you've been there. Yeah, me buddy Jamie used to smoke there. Me and Hannah went a few times. Anybody go there anymore? Don't think so. Haven't been there since. I can't stop thinking about that night. I should have walked her home. Yeah, but you didn't. Sometimes I can't breathe, I jus panic... I just fucking panic. I still see her, out of the corner of me eye. I find a can or two helps. Don't go down that road. How do you cope? This is for you. Hannah gave it to me, its to your parents house. What? The lads are wondering, Mike. Wondering about what? Just wondering where's your head at? What's that supposed to mean? Look where we are! Look who you are just fucking talking to! Where's your head at? Cause mine's on finding a place to grow this weed. We all know you have been through a lot. And if you need to take some time... Phil and Robbie? They've got a lot to lose too, Mike. Ye think my heads not in it and your plan is what? - Push me out? - It's not like that. Look... I haven't thought about my dad for ages, right. And now I cant stop fucking thinking about him cause of that fucking grave yard. We all cared about Hannah. And right now we need to be focused. Have you been to the house that Cyril told me about? Have ya? No. Climpy has. I know who used to use the place, what it was used for and I also know how to get in. As far as I can see I am more focused then all of ye. Why not spend less time thinking about where my head is at and a bit more getting Cyril his fucking money. Tex, leave Climpy be. Yeah. How are we getting in? The garden at the back of the house. There's our boy. What's up with you? He's a snake. Go on. I got my reasons. So tell us. Don't need to tell you anything. Remember the last time I come to stay with ya? My dad stopped talking to me cause of him. Eric came round the house late one night, high as a kite, started throwing stones at the window, trying to get me. Except he is throwing stones at the wrong fucking window, wakes me dad up, starts yelling at him to come and get me. Saying we got some bag of pills we need to take, even offering me old man some. That was generous of him. That was the last time he spoke to me, my dad. Died two weeks later, fucking heart attack. The key is under the green flower pot. Meet me in the park. It's all over the house. Recent? I don't think so. Rest of the house? Looks empty. There's a door upstairs I can't open. Check the attic. Reminds me of your place. Fuck off. Nothing up there. Joe. What ya think? Someone could have been here this morning or last year. Hm. And what did Cyril have to say? About the house? He says no one comes here. Why not? This place should be a junkies paradise, man. Let's see what the lads have to say. Well? What ye think? Yeah, it could work. Are you sure no one comes here? That's what Cyril said. I dunno, something doesn't feel right. We've got a little over two months. - It's a good spot for a crop, - Yeah. You'd get at least fifty plants up in the attic. Who asked you, you cunt? Just sayin'. Eric. I'll be next door. Is there a reason why he is still here? He'll be gone soon, alright! Lads, we need to get started, yeah? It's a risk. Yeah. What about that front bedroom? Phil. We could get the gear in tonight, have it setup by tomorrow evening. And is someone going to stay? I think a walk away is better. The attic, yeah? Yeah, its more work, but if somebody comes in they won't find it. And power? We just tap into the attic light, run the power off that. Ventilation? We can knock a brick out of this chimney and we vent straight up. What about the attic hatch, if someone does turn up? We leave it. What about Cyril? Give us a minute. Robbie's got a point. What, about him? Yeah about him, is he gonna fuck us over? I don't think so. Are you sure about that? Well, what other choice have we got? And does anybody else know about the place? Climpy. Is he gonna be a problem? Alright. We'll get the gear in tonight. What'd you say to Ellen? What? Earlier. What did you say to her? Nothing. I saw ya, man. I said you were on the wagon. And that's it? That's it. Alright. How ya getting on? Joe! Take the weight! Fucking help us! He's not breathing. What was he doing in the fucking attic? I don't know. You sent him up there, Mike. To open the fucking door. Not to go into the attic. He must have slipped. Got caught up in the cord. It's wrapped around his fucking neck, Joe. So he just hung himself now, did he? What else is there? - We need to get out of here. - Eric! - I wanna go! - Don't you fucking move. We need to leave. We could find somewhere else for the grow. Yeah. What about Phil? Leave him here. - Don't say a fucking word. - Relax. We ain't leaving him here. And what are we gonna do with him? I don't fucking know, but we ain't leaving him here. He has an attic at home, right? What are ya saying? When it's dark, we're gonna take him home and hang him in his attic. Jesus fucking Christ. He killed himself. It's got to look like that. - Makes sense. - Don't fucking say anything, right! You listening to me? Shut the fuck up. I'm not fucking doing that. Then don't. This is wrong. Mike. We can't do this! I see her sometimes. Who? Hannah. At the end of my bed. In the street. I'm her big brother, man, and I wasn't there. I feel the same way. I wish I was there, too. She used to fancy you. Big Joe. Didn't she ask you to go to the school dance with her? Yeah, she did, ya. Phil was one of our best mates. I know. But you're right. We'll bring him down to the back door. And we'll take him home tonight. I'll talk to the lads. Are you really going along with this? Joe. We can't do this. You know what happens when we don't pay up. What about Phil? Phil put us in this shit. And this is our way out. Mike. Let's do this. Are you ready? There's somebody coming. Move. Up the ladder. C'mon. Eric, get up here quick. Come on! Hurry up! Close the hatch. Mike? Mike! Where the fuck is he, Mike? Mike! Joe, get the fucking ladder! Where the fuck is he? Mike? Mike? He got up. And walked out with them. What do you mean he got up? You're losing it, Mike. - We should get out of here. - Yeah, fuck that I'm gone! Keep him in the house! We're leaving. Wipe it all down. Mike? What the fuck happened? Mike? Eddie. In here. Dad? We have to get out of here. Yeah, we are. Fuck this shit. Eddie! Robbie! We wait. For what? We all go together. I just wanna get out of here. Mike? Mike? Eddie? Eddie? Eddie. Where's the bag? We can't leave without the bag. Forget the bag! I'm not staying. You know what happens if we don't find that bag? Fuck the bag! Let him fucking go! You and Ellen? What? Now's not the time, Joe! I don't fucking care. You wanna spend time with Sarah, right? Yeah, but not like that. While I'm with Sarah your banging my missus. That is not going to happen. If you cared about Sarah, you'd have laid off the bottle. We can go round and round on this after. Yeah, we're coming back to this, Mike. Search the bathroom and the attic. Sarah? Do it.
