Sean Bryant, AKA Juice. Long time no see. Man, when the hell you get out? I thought you was locked up. I just got out. I thought you was back back up north. What you doing down here? What's going on? I seen you hustling boys at Grove the other today. You know, easy money. You know I'm about that. I see you doing your thing. So what's up? Let's take a ride, Juice. I need you to run me somewhere. (footsteps) [Capone] Sweet. (chuckling) You like that? [Capone] Yeah, I like this. Love this, boy. (phone chiming) (upbeat hip hop music) (upbeat hip hop music continuing) (upbeat hip hop music continuing) Yeah man, I seen you and that little punk ass white boy doing y'all thing out there. I appreciate that. Y'all taking what y'all want. Y'all making it happen. Y'all just like me. I take what the fuck I want, and I make it happen. I like that shit about you. Y'know, we went to high school together, we played ball together for that shit. Ball ain't for me, ball for you. - Yeah. - Right now, I gotta go get what's mine. Somebody owe me some shit, know what I'm saying? So I'm going over here to get that shit. Word, you gonna be straight? Yeah, I'm gonna be straight, know what I'm saying? You ain't gotta worry about nothin', just drive. (turn signal clicking) Know what I'm saying? All right, bruh. We gonna pull over right here. We're gonna take that left, and then we gonna make this right. Wait right here, I'll be right back. (door shutting) (footsteps) (hip hop music) Hey, what's up, sweet thing? I might have to bring you your favorite, you know you love the crab legs. (gunshot firing) (gunshot firing) (gunshot firing) - Yeah, motherfucker! (gunshot firing) (chains rattling) (hip hop music continuing) Hey, baby, I'm gon' call you back. Let's go, nigga, let's go, man. Man, what the hell you done did, man? Man, I had to get back. - Oh my God. - Get the fuck outta here, man. (engine starting) (car accelerating) Man, what the fuck you done did, man? Don't tell me you done killed somebody, bruh. I heard gunshots. Nigga, drive, man, take me to the lofts, man. Let's get the outta here, man. I had to do what the fuck I had to do, dog. [Juice] You just got out, you couldn't resist, bruh? Nah, I can't resist, man. [Juice] God damn. - Kill a motherfucker when it's time. [Juice] Man, you got me in this shit! You better not tell no fuckin' body. Man, I ain't tellin' nobody. Just get out my shit, when it's time. - Man, shit, drive, nigga. - Oh my fuckin' god. This nigga done got me in some shit. (door squeaking) (TV quietly playing) Damn door. Hey, so wrong phone? Huh? Man, I ain't got time. You been gone all day. You don't call, I call you, go straight to voicemail. So what's the issue? [Juice] I just got somethin' going on. You wanna talk about it? [Juice] Not really. I mean something's eatin' you up. It's not good to hold things in. We talk about everything. So what makes this situation so special that you can't talk about? We talk about everything. Man, I tried to look out for an old friend, and he done got me in some shit. I done told you and I told you about these friends. You don't listen, I tell you to come to me before things like this happen. So who was it? Tony, Anthony, who? [Juice] Capone. (chuckling) That motherfucker I used to date, back in the day? Really? Did he not just get the fuck out? He used to keep money in my pocket. I had to look out for him. That's not the point. Since Mama died, I've done everything I can. I know, I know... That was my promise. To stick together. [Juice] I know, and I'm grateful- - We all that we have left. But you taking a risk every time you go out here and do this stupid shit. You got me here, stressed out. You don't call, like I said. I don't even know where you be at half the time. And it's unfair to me to have to sit here, and worry about you like that. Look man, I said I'm good. Capone got me, so I got him. Man, I don't wanna hear shit about motherfuckin' Capone. Because at this point right now, the way I feel about him, and what he put me through when we was dating, that's the last name you should ever mention around me. (sighing) [Juice] Man, just hit me up. It's not the point of hitting you up. We need to figure out how to get you out this situation and cut his ass off completely. Before you both will be in the same damn cell. So what we gonna do about this situation? I mean come on, you- we got to do something, and we got to do something fast. Because the way you going right now, you either gonna be dead or locked up with his ass. And I'm not about to let either one of those happen. I got it. Don't worry about it, I got it. (snapping fingers) I mean, come on. [Juice] I got it. And that's that same (clapping emphatically) attitude that I hate about you. I said I got it! It ain't the- - Well you know what, since you want to carry it like that. Nigga, that's why I ain't even cook. Go fix a fuckin' sandwich. (mumbling angrily) You know what nigga? That's why you ate good all these years, you still maining and containing. And I tell you what, you better not touch my fuckin' Kool-Aid either. [Juice] I don't even drink Kool-Aid, I drink Gatorade. Oh, you uppity, nigga, okay that's good. (suspenseful music) Good morning, detectives. I don't know if you guys have heard it, but an informant was murdered. No captain, we wasn't aware. Well, to get you up to speed, it was an FBI informant. So Captain, do we have any lead suspects, witnesses? Sources say that it could be Detective Kenyatta's nephew. I want y'all to bring him in for questioning. - Okay Captain. - We'll be right on it. Now listen, I don't need y'all messing around on this, because the FBI's on my head about this case. So I need y'all to be on it, okay? Okay. All right, y'all can go. Yo. Yo, what up, Juice? What's good with it. (hands slapping) Nothin' much man. Juice. (hands slapping) - What's good with it? Funny thing, how we ran into you, though. Yeah. Y'know, so you playing in the league this year? Yeah, I think I'm gonna take my talents out there. Okay, okay, well, why don't you come play for the south side? Mm, south side? Yeah, south side, man. You know where we at. I already holler at the boys on the north, though. You holler at the boys of the- Forget them, man. They don't need you, we need you. Okay, south side. - South side. - What's in it for me? $50,000, that's the pot. We can all split it. - Split? - That's big money, man. That sounds good, but I already committed to the north side. North side? North side don't need you. We need you, man. (scoffing) (mumbling) Come on man, you on the south side right now. South side is where it's at, baby. Man, I'm good everywhere. But I already committed, though. Look, you know who you playing for? It's me, Cody, man. Do you do you not know- Four years in college, if I hadn't blown out my ACL, man, I would've been up there with Iverson. Much respect, I respect that. I definitely respect you. Look man, I'm leading triple doubles baby. You know what I'm saying? Leading score, assist, and defense. Can't beat that, bruh. He ain't with that- - So, I don't think you want to play against me. So it's best to be on my team. Oh nah, see, that sounds like a challenge, baby. You know I ain't backing down from no challenge. Bruh, you don't want to do that. Hey. So you don't wanna be on the south side? Man, fuck you and the north side, man. (scoffing) - Yeah, all right, like I said, have y'all money ready. Have our money ready? You right... You gon' disrespect the OG like that though, dog? You gonna- - Man, fuck Juice, man. Man, I can't believe this nigga. Look, he probably got problems paying tuition and everything, man. Still eating Ramen noodles and shit, man. That nigga named Juice, right? - Yeah, he juice. - Put the squeeze on that motherfucker. Put the squeeze on him, let's do it. But, we do need him. You still don't know who the fuck I am, do you? (tsking) I just heard about the third killing, and this whole entire scene. Now, this happened to be a very big one. 'Cause otherwise, Captain would not have us come this far. Detectives. - Captain. - Good morning. How you doing? Detective Kenyatta. Sources say your nephew's car was spotted leaving the crime scene. You are kidding me, right? We're not 100% sure, but evidence shows that it could be your nephew's car. So, we're not a hundred percent sure that it could be his nephew's car. Well the both of you will get to the bottom of this. I will not have the FBI take over this case. We don't want it either, but I mean, damn, you just gave us this and we need to- - Did you hear what I said? I heard what you said. Okay, well, I need you to get on the job. I am your superior. You listen to me. You don't come in here telling me what to do. Oh and by the way, detective Kenyatta, I've already sent two of my guys to bring in your nephew for questioning. I mean, come on, Cap', listen. This cannot be his nephew. He's like family to me, too, and I know my damn friend- - Hold on, we not in here for family. We in here to do a job. Don't make me take your badge, because you will be out there answering phone calls for the rest of the damn month. You want to take this badge? Fine, fuck it. (badge clattering loudly) You can leave your gun, too, while you at it. And don't expect no pay! Captain, my nephew has never been in any trouble. I just cannot see him doing this. Captain, he's going to college. He's going to do something with his life. We are going to find who really did this because I know deep in my heart that my nephew did not do this. (sighing) Captain, I'm sorry for the outburst. (stammering) There's no excuse, but it just don't make sense that his nephew, it's more like- He's like a brother to me. My nephew is going through this situation. All these innocent, young, black men constantly getting arrested and you just have him brought in here without even consulting us first. That's his nephew, you should have consulted him first. That's all I'm saying. But I understand you're doing your job and I want to get to the bottom of- I promise you, we going to get to the bottom of it. [Captain] I'm depending on you guys to crack this case. - We will. - I ain't sayin' nothing but a word. - We will. - Let's go. (humming tune) Sean Bryan, we need to have a word with you. About what? Mr. Bryant, we need to take you down to the precinct. We got a serious matter to question you about. For what? You don't need to worry about that. You need to just come with us. Come on. Man, I ain't- - Come on. Come on man. You tripping. Come on. (shoes scraping against concrete) (distant speaking) (slapping fist) - That 50 stacks. 50 stacks, baby, you already know. But look, if Juice don't want to work with us, we going to have to doggone get on John. Bro, he out here buzzing in the streets. I know he buzzing. But that's why we get with John. We convince John to throw the game our way. Then we win, (shoes scraping on concrete) we secure the spot. South side, nigga. South side, that's what I'm talking about, baby. Woo! (chains rattling) Lord, life is good. Look at my babies, they're growing. Success is in the movement. Yes, beautiful. What's up John? What's going on, what's going on fellas? Ah, man, Suzy Homemaker. (hands slapping) I see you got the green thumb around here. (church bells tolling) - What's going on? Always keep a green thumb. This is my life, here. My plants and everything else, and my weed collection over there. Oh, word. I'll have some of that a little bit later. - I bet you do. - We came to you to talk on some serious notes, man. Serious about what? Y'know, we need you to swing the game our way. Swing the game... South side needs to win. South side needs to win the game? So, you... Yeah, nigga. South side. South side, bruh. - Okay. - You trying to - save the streets, right? - Yeah, I'm always for the community. Look, the only way you gonna save these streets is if you vote for south side, and daggone ref the game our way. - Otherwise, you got a problem. - Look, much love, so y'know, save yourself. Save yourself, brother. (patting) Seriously. (punching) (grunting) (grunting) - Now do we got - an understanding? - Ow, man. [Goon] South side, nigga. You gonna ref for south side, right? Damn, this sounds cool on a mix tape. Whatever it takes. Man, maybe we should hit this motherfucker again. Nah, I think he knows. What side, what side? South side, man. There you go. Sound like a winner now, eh? Hey, bag me up some weed, too. (giggling) (groaning) Street thugs, street thugs eat shit. (hip hop music) Hello, Captain. My name is Detective Ray and this is- - Detective Kittles. [Captain] It's nice to meet you. [Kittles] Nice to meet you. You have a case that we are mutually interested in, and we would like to question the gentleman that you have in custody. Hold on, wait, this is our case. We had this case first. [Ray] That's true. But the problem with that is- the guy that you have in custody, we believe he's our guy. There was an informant that we had, that we were working with, and he was murdered. So we really need to talk to your guy. It's not up for debate. We've got evidence, it's really starting to mount up, and it's imperative that we talk to him. And the sooner the better. Okay, well how about this then? Could we, at least, be a part of this case? I don't see a problem in that. As long as your men stay out of the way. Don't get too involved and take just a step back. And let us have the lead. You got my word. Okay. What interrogation room are you holdin' him in? [Captain] Room three. And what direction is that? Down the hall, to your left. Thank you. [Kittles] Thank you. - You're welcome. (chair clattering) Motherfuckers. Sean Bryant, I think you know why we're here. - I'm Detective Ray. - I'm Detective Kittles. [Juice] How y'all doing? I don't know why I'm here, but- - You don't have any idea? [Juice] No ma'am. [Ray] Where were you at last Wednesday night? Walk me through your day. Mm. Wednesday, early in the morning, I had a workout at the field house, y'know, running up a couple bleachers. That afternoon, I met with my girlfriend Stacy. We went out to eat. [Ray] I'm gonna stop you there. Take note of of his girlfriend's name. What's your girlfriend's name? [Juice] Stacy. I need her full name. [Juice] Stacy Marie Johnson. And how can I contact her? [Juice] Facebook, I guess. No, I need her contact information. [Ray] Does she live with you? Phone number? [Juice] No she doesn't, she lives with her parents. [Ray] Okay. What's her phone number? It's (434) 222-9834. [Kittles] Okay. And she'll be able to alibi that you were with her the entire time? [Juice] Yes. [Ray] Okay. We've got evidence that states otherwise. So if we go looking further, is there anything that you think you need to tell us now? Because you'll be in less trouble if you tell us now. If you don't tell us now, we can't help you later on down the road. We've got evidence that says otherwise. So you might as well tell us, because if you don't, there's nothing we can do for you later on. So if there's anything you haven't told us, now is your best shot of getting a fair deal. Evidence? [Ray] Yeah, evidence. What kind of evidence do you have? [Kittles] Well, we have evidence of a car that looks just like yours at the scene. Look man, I said it's not me. I'm tired, I'm hungry and I gotta go to the gym. Can I go? Is this your car? [Ray] It looks just like your car to us. You tell us, what are we supposed to believe? So you're gonna deny this. It's not me. There's thousands of Dodge Challengers, and it could be anybody, it's not me. And you expect us to believe this, when there are probably witnesses that we're gonna find, that are gonna say that you were there. [Juice] Well, ask your witnesses, it's not me. I'm telling you, it's not me. This is your one chance, and you're gonna blow it. Do you realize how many people actually come in here, and they sit in that very same chair, claiming that they're innocent, it's not me. You've got the wrong person. And do you know how many of those same people are found later, as being guilty and they're up there, spending time in jail? You don't wanna do that. You're trying to go to school, right? [Juice] Yes, ma'am. Okay, then you don't wanna be doing this. You don't wanna be lying to us, because the truth is gonna come out. [Juice] Okay, okay, I get it, can I please go now? Before we decide to let you go- Who's this? [Juice] I have no idea. You've not seen him anywhere around? [Juice] No clue, I have- - None of the people you hang out with? [Juice] No clue, can I go now? Well, he was just released from prison, and we have surveillance of him leaving the scene, and we believe he has something to do with it. [Ray] Are you sure you don't know this guy? [Juice] Nope, never seen him. [Ray] It's very convenient. [Juice] Never seen him. All right, can I leave now? You're free to go, but don't leave town. (door shutting) I don't believe him. No, there's too much evidence. Yeah, there is. I really think he has something to do with it. I think he knows this guy right here. He's just not gonna tell us. I think he does. The look on his face, I think he knows him. Oh yeah, yeah, definitely. And I think they both had something to do with it. I totally agree. We've just gotta get to the bottom of it. Yeah, we do. Gotta see if we can't find some witnesses out there - to make our case. - We do. (chair creaking) We need to go tell the Captain, and inform her of what we found out. Yeah, this captain's not gonna be too happy with us. [Kittles] No. Good afternoon detective, Captain. [Captain] Good afternoon. We talked to the guy, and we really think that he's our guy, y'know? I don't think anybody in this precinct is gonna believe his story, I really don't. Everything adds up that it's him. And to be honest with you, all he's got for an alibi is a girlfriend. Do you really think that we're gonna buy that? Well, do you guys have any evidence that you can use to support this claim? Let's be real here. We're not gonna give you everything we have. I will give you a piece of evidence, as I'm sure your team is doing their own investigation, even though we agreed to do this together. So, I think it's only fair that we hold back what we have until we get more information. But I'm gonna share this little tidbit with you. We believe he knows who he is. [Kittles] And we definitely believe he's involved as well. Let's go somewhere private and talk about this. Okay, we can sit down and have a discussion, But I'm not gonna change my mind. We're not gonna give you everything we have. [Captain] Okay. Okay. Lead the way. (papers rustling) (distant sirens) Detective Kenyatta, we have reason to believe that your nephew is part of a crime. Well, what information do you have on my nephew? [Ray] First of all, we're not gonna give you everything, like we told your Captain. Then we might as well cut this chit-chat and just stop it where we at, right now. [Ray] No, I don't think that would be a good idea. Well, I think it would be awesome because one thing for sure, two things for certain- y'all not on this case, we are. Let me break it down to you like this. Do you know who we are? Yeah. [Kittles] We're definitely on it. And we can shut you down at any time, and we're not gonna have to give you a shared partnership in this. We told your Captain that we would. Now y'all wanna play hardball, we'll shut you down and we'll just take the case and solve it all by ourself. It's your choice, the ball's in your court. You know what? Yeah sure, you'll be able to, y'know, chop us down from this, no problem. You'll be able to stop us and take this case. But guess what? [Ray] What? We already on the mission and we almost finished it. Oh by the way, one more thing. Why don't you take your little tacky shirt and you can get on outta our way, and get your little princess too. 'Cause we about to go finish it, let's go. Yeah, we got a case to solve. Not if we solve it first. Oh, we gonna beat you to it, princess. (serene music) (beatboxing quietly) Yo, that's that nigga that took my money the other day. Sure is, that's him. Yeah, that's him, that's definitely him. (quiet trap music) (crickets chirping) (ball bouncing) (hoop rattling) (ball dribbling) (hoop rattling) (ball bouncing) (shoes scraping on concrete) (hoop rattling) (ball bouncing) (hoop rattling) (ball bouncing) (hoop rattling loudly) (ball bouncing) (net swooshing) (ball bouncing) (hoop rattling) Hey, yo, college boy, you ever met a Ruger? Don't nobody come to Grove and try to take my money, and live to see it. Yeah, you got me the other day. You got me. You'll never play basketball again. Never. (suspenseful music) (ball bouncing) (fence rattling) (suspenseful music continuing) (fence rattling) (fence rattling loudly) Nigga, I'm gonna get you. I'm gonna get you, I'm gon' get you. (shoes scraping dirt) (metallic clattering) (shovel clattering) (shoes scraping dirt) (crickets chirping) (chuckling) I know you out here. Juice, I know you out here. I'm gon' find you. (crickets chirping) I'm gon' find you. I know you out here. I know you hiding. You couldn't have got away that fast. I was right on you. I know I'm close. I can smell you. Juice, Juice, Where you at? I know you out here. Come out, don't be scared. Ain't no boys out here, just men. Yo! Yo. VA Capone? What you doing out here? Nobody fucks with Juice, man. It ain't got nothing to do with you. Huh? It ain't got nothing to do with you. It got everything to do- - It ain't got nothing to do with you, Capone. It got everything to do with me. Stay out the way, Capone. It's between me and Juice. It's between me and Juice. It ain't got nothing to do with you. Stay out the way, Capone. You in the motherfuckin' way. Juice my little nigga. If anybody got a problem with him, they got a problem with me. Stay out the way. (gunshots firing) I'm in the motherfuckin' way, nigga? (spitting) You in the motherfuckin' way, nigga. It always gonna be my way. Pussy-ass bitch. Juice, come on, nigga, come on out man. Capone? Yeah, it's me. Come on, let's go, man. That motherfucker out here, dead. Come on. [Juice] Man, what the fuck? Man, Capone, this shit is crazy, bruh. (hands slapping) Let's go make some money, bruh. That's what we do. (hip hop music continues) All right, man, I'll get up with you. All right, bro. (hip hop music continuing) (hip hop music continuing) Sean, are you in any trouble? [Juice] No, I'm good. I'm here for you, just let me know. Unc, I got everything under control. If I need you, I'll call you. You keep popping up. Sean, were you involved in any murder? Nah, what made you say that? The FBI had said they seen your car in a place where a murder was committed. Nah, not my car, it must be another car. Are you sure? Because if so, we can talk about this. I'm here to help you. Unc, I'm good. Whatever they got on me, it ain't true. Don't believe it. Son, I believe you. But if you are in any kind of trouble, I'm here to help you. I know, I know. All right, Unc, for the thousandth time. I know you got me, but I got workouts in the morning and I gotta go get some rest. Well, look, if you need me, call me. Let me know. I know, I got you. (footsteps) (crickets chirping) Coach Nash. Oh, detective Kenyatta, how you doing, sir? I'm doing great, sir. How are you? I'm good. I just run into your nephew the other day. He's playing for me in the big Save the Street tournament this year. Juice is in it? Oh yes sir, yes sir. He's the best point guard I ever had, man. I really think we gonna bring it home this year, with him. I'm looking forward to that. No, I'm glad, he looks like he doing good, staying out the streets. Ah, I might have to correct you on that, sir. [Coach] Oh, no. - I'm trying to keep him out of the streets. But he's a good fellow and he's going somewhere someday. [Coach] Yes sir. - I know this, I know this. Yes sir, he is. Well, hopefully, this game will help keep him out the streets. It's supposed to be a lot of big scouts at the game this year. That's good to hear, yes sir. I am happy to hear that. All right, well, I'm gonna run in here and get my order, and get back to the house. The whole family's starving. It's very good seeing you, sir. Well, I'll see you later, Detective. I hope to catch you at the tournament. Yes sir, I plan to be there. Thank you. (cicadas droning) (door squeaking) [Juice] Watch your step. Hello. And where have you been? [Juice] I've been out. (sighing) They just showed another double homicide. I be worried, that's why I ask you these things. Not to be nosy, not to pry. I know you a grown man, but I'm still your sister, at the end of the day, and I worry. Like I said, we all we got. So when I ask you, where have you been? Please don't get sarcastic. I'm doing it outta love. [Juice] Look, can we talk about this another time? I got things to do. We did this situation for right now, but we'll talk about it again. Thank you. Man, please don't be in there fucking all night, makin' no babies. - Thank you. - Man, don't listen. Whatever. What's wrong, are you good? I'm all right. You alright? I think I gotta tell you something. Okay. What do you gotta tell me? [Juice] You know Capone? Yeah, your sister's ex, yeah.
