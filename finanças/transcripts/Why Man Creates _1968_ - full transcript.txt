The lever. Harry. do you realize you just invented the whole wheel? I know, I know. Bronze! Iron! All was in chaos until Euklit arose and made order. What is the good life? And how do you lead it? Who shall rule the state? The philosopher king. The aristocrats. The people. You mean all the people? What is the nature of the good? What is the nature of justice? What is happiness? Hail Xena! Roman law is now in session! I've invented the zero! What? Nothing, nothing. The Earth moves! The Earth is round! The blood circulates! There are worlds smaller than ours! There are worlds larger than ours! Hey, what are you doin'? I'm a paintin' the cielin', what are you doin'? I'm paintin' the floor. Darwin says man is an animal. Not, man is not an animal. - Animal! - Man! Shall we start from the beginning? I'm a bug, I'm a germ, I'm a bug, I'm a. Louis Pasteur! I'm not a bug, I'm not a germ, I'm not a bug. You think it'll work Alfred? Let's give it a try. What do ya think? It worked. - All men are created- - Life, liberty - and the- - Workers of the world! Government of the people by the people. The world must be made safe for-- I see one third of a nation, he'll. One world! Help! Good morning ladies and gentlemen. Today we will discuss the bone structure of the cranium. You will note first that the base of the skull is divided by two transverse ridges forming the three basilar fosse. Over the cerebellum, the dura separated the occipital lobes from the cerebellum by the tentorium cerebelli. Along the base is- The code? Nine, 0, 0, four, six. Social security number? Five, two, four, two, two, three, five, eight, eight. Telephone? 876-0930. Seven, seven, two, two, one. Four, three, two, one, six. eight. Four, five, seven, two. Seven, five, three, four, two, one, eight. Four, two, one, eight, five. Five, two, eight, seven. one. Four, four, four, six, nine? Two, nine, three. The three, 0, two, one. Four, four, six. Seven, 0, four, six, nine. Man you've got a great cup. Get the money bag, but the hang ups. Freedom man, that's what it's all about. Yeah, Freedom man, that's what it's all about. There's not thing in them eyes but the satisfaction of their own egos. Oh I'm not complaining and I know times have changed but certain things remain constant. When I was a youngster. Hello down there! I knew right from wrong. We knew the value of a dollar and we knew the meaning of hard work and sacrifice. Where do ideas come from? I'm looking at one thing and seeing another. I'm fooling around. Playing with possibilities. Speculating. Changing- Pushing, pulling. Transforming. And if you're lucky, you come up with something maybe worth saving and using. And building on. That's where the game stops and the work begins. I admitted I had days of such discouragement that I ached to give it all up but something kept me going. I guess it was faith. The kind you've when you're very young and don't know any better. When the stuff comes alive and turns crazy on ya, a writer had better be in pretty good shape. With good legs and a counterpunch and ready to fight like hell to the blood end. As one grows older, one sees the impossibility of imposing your will on the chaos with brute force. But if you're patient, there may come that moment when while eating an apple, the solution presents itself politely and says, here I am. Marge! Works huh? Harry. All it needs is an American flag. Finally that moment when society makes its contribution to the creative process. What a piece of garbage that is. Ridiculous. Terrible. Sick. And I must say we're getting quite a reaction from the crowd. Let's see if we can get some more. Sir, could you tell us what you think of it. It's degrading. And you sir? It's gonna hurt us abroad. And you ma'am. It's all right if you like modern. They're going too far you know. I can't say what I think about it because I'm an old, old American. And you know how they figure, from Nebraska. That'll never fly Orval. I think it's kind of a foot on. Well, I think it's all right. - You like it? - Yes I think- Oh my word! Sick! In fact it seems like a crease in some civil mechanism in man's mind. I couldn't tell really, I don't know. - Look at that! - No it's base, and modest. Look at the form, look at the bottom there. It represents the decline of the west. This guy's a nut! I think you should be shot, people that do a thing like that. You gotta give the - artist credit! - No, don't give anybody credit! That's where your tax payers money go! Die! Sick! Superficial! It stinks! I don't know, I like it. I'm not an expert but speaking strictly as a mother, it seems to me the material alone must be worth at least $100. Boing. boing, boing, boing. Boing, boing, boing, boing. Boing. Hey! Boing, boing. - Hurry UP! - Hurry UP! - Come here! - Hey that's not bad. Come on, hurry up. Harvey, bring your sisters. Hey, watch out. - Witch! - I was here first. I didn't have a very good roll on. Look at that! Wow! Wee! Have you ever thought that radical ideas threaten institutions then become institutions and in turn reject radical ideas which threaten institutions? No. Gee, for a minute I thought I had something. Doctor Delbecko, we've heard some news of a breakthrough. Well yes. I think we're on to something important. We have been working with small a virus which we know induces cancer. A small virus, means it does a few things when it enters the cell. We've been trying to find out which ones who disfunctions, changes the normal cell into a cancer cell. We already have ruled out several of these functions. And we know enough about the others, so that we can now make a really conclusive experiment. We are very optimistic and we hope to have positive results within say, five years. Doctor Delbecko has been working on cancer research for 20 years. When I began working on the world food problem, only one person out of three across the world went to bed hungry. Today, in spite of all our progress, two out of three people go to bed hungry. More than two billion people in the world as a whole. This is because the greatest increase and world population has occurred in those areas and have the lowest productivity of food. The problem just continues to expand as we work on it. What specific progress have you made doctor? We have just developed strains of tomatoes and of peas that can grow in areas where these crops couldn't be grown previously. We have also now produced strains of cereals and have all of the nutritive value of a piece of meat. I think that we'll be able to get the whole problem under control soon, say, 15 or 20 years. Doctor Bonner has been working on this problem for 12 years now. Actually this makes for a very interesting dilemma. You see the Big Bang Theory says that 15 billion years ago, a gigantic explosion blew all the matter in the universe apart - and it's still blowing- - Doctor Greenstein is working on the origin of the universe. We should find 30% helium. Okay. I now have the technology to observe very much fainter, old stars and I find they have no helium. And my colleagues agree. If this apparent discovery is true, the Big Bang Theory is false and we'll have to develop an entirely new theory to account for the origin of the universe. But the other possibility is equally provocative. And I'm wrong. At what you observe at the surface of a star, doesn't have to be what's really there. Doctor Greenstein has been working on the origin of the universe for over 20 years. Well we've hit a blank wall for now. The line of investigation we have been pursuing seems to have lead nowhere. But that's the nature of the process. You get what you think is a marvelous idea, and it just doesn't pan out. How long have you been working on this problem doctor Weiler? Seven years. What do you aim to do now? I don't know. Why does man create? Men have struggled against time, against decay, against destruction, against death. Some have cried out in torment and agony. Some have fought with arrogance and fierce pride. Some challenge the Gods, matching power with power. Some have celebrated life. Some have burned with faith. Some have spoken in voices we no longer understand. Some have spoken eloquently. Some have spoken inarticulately. Some haltingly. Some have been almost mute. Yet among all the variety of human expression, a thread of connection, a common mark can be seen, that urge to look into ones self and out of the world and say, this is what I am. I am unique, I am here, lam.
