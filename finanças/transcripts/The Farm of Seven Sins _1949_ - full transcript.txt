Who's writing these pamphlets? Paul-Louis Courier. Paul-Louis Courier. - Paul-Louis Courier. Paul-Louis Courier! P.-L. Courier! A royalist. LONG LIVE P.-L. COURIER, LIVING AT LA CHAVONNTIERE. Which one's this? The Woodcutter of Larçay. He rails against prejudice and injustice! A good man! No! A fanatical and dangerous sectarian. Hatred. He sows hatred! A miser! And an egoist! Nobody should judge a man in two words, but Courier sees everyone in that manner. Circumstances have made my husband into a political writer. He doesn't like his role as a pamphleteer, of public accuser. If this cap knew what I think, I'd burn it. Courier, I'll bust your skull! I didn't kill him! Murdered by subscription. He was good like the Good Lord PAUL-LOUIS, YOU HAVE EVERYTHING TO BE HAPPY FOR, YOUR FATE IS DECIDED. WATCH OUT! They're watching for the slightest slip. - Your overly keen sense of justice. THIS LOVE YOU HAVE FOR A WOMAN TOO YOUNG FOR YOU. Your avarice. - Your outbursts IT WON'T TAKE MUCH, PAUL-LOUIS, BEFORE SUDDENLY... ...misfortune closes upon you like a trap. Say nothing about this to your families. These are not fairy tales to tell in front of your children. Nothing to worry about! - Someone must be out hunting. At least one wild boar less. Did you hear that?! - Another bad guy has stolen some of your master's game. Best not to hang around here. Another drink! Aren't you ashamed of how much you've drunk already? You'd do better to go and see what's happened to the master. He's never been this late. Why? He knows what time soup is served! That's right. He could be in the process of blackening some paper It must be painful for him to piss ink. I don't want to have a dictionary thrown at me. Then you'll eat charcoal. It won't keep any longer, the ratatouille. - Yes, he's certainly not early. Go and see. Something's not right. Maybe he's fallen asleep. Okay, I'll go take a look. But if he's there or not, we eat! Mr. Courier! Master? Master? The master is having a lie down? - Not returned. Master? "Because the Devil has intervened in my affairs in France." Twenty gods! Here he is! By the looks of it, he put up a fight He's lost a shoe. - It must have been a fair fight. No weapons. It's not a suicide. - Search him. Let the constabulary do it. - Why? You still scared of him? He's not going to bite you! He wasn't killed for a robbery. Here's his money. Stay here... We'll alert the gendarmes. This will stir up a storm. He had enemies. I expected it, to find him one day lying here, his ear torn off like a bad dog. - When dogs go bad, we shoot them or we throttle them. Something bad's happened. The lord has been murdered. - What? The lord. They've found him in the forest of Larçay. It wasn't a pretty sight. He must've taken a full blast of buckshot. I hope you don't have any trouble. - Trouble? You'd been kicked off the farm. - Well, so had he! Yes, but I never badgered the landlady, didn't take advantage of her like the others. Possibly. But what about the theft? The gendarmes came to see you. - Anybody can be under suspicion. But who's going to defend him? It could be more complicated than we know. There's a hatred... surrounding him. A hatred! Oh Symphorien, it's awful! If I'd known... The gendarmes are here already? They can smell carrion from afar. I'd forgotten this mud! This ocean of mud. But Symphorien, he didn't suffer too much? No danger of that. He was killed on the spot. Bijou! Here. Edmond Chancel, the king's prosecutor. Mrs Paul-Louis Courier, I presume. It's terrible. I left la Chavonnière the day before yesterday To think that in my absence... - Calm down, dear Madame. Justice is compassionate. The personality of the victim was known to us. I regret having to keep you here, but please see in me a friend who will defend your rights, and who you must help in his task. These last two days, where were you? My mother was visiting friends in Tours. I went to see her. Their names? Is this necessary? It is in a murder, dear Madame. The Marquis de Siblas. He was very close to my husband. We'll record your statement later on. Second question... What are the names of the servants and regular visitors to La Chavonnière? Aside from the Marquis de Siblas, my husband saw nobody. And we have 4 servants: Frémont, the gamekeeper and my husband's trusted man. "La Michel", his wife. Symphorien Dubois, the farmhand. François Sovignant, a simpleton, who does odd jobs. Good. That will be all for now. Go and take some rest. This is a great ordeal for you. Come in! Well, my dear investigating judge. How's the inquiry? A nasty business. A business that could become dangerous. Dangerous? - For the rest of us. Too many possible culprits. That man attracted hatreds as naturally as a lightning conductor. Republican scum! - Precisely. This could be a political crime. Who said anything about a political crime? Forget that idea right now. The enemies of the king would like nothing better... than to magnify this affair. You yourself said that there are many suspects. So what are you talking about? This is a domestic crime. A well-conducted interrogation can't fail to reveal the guilty party. I've gathered together the witnesses in the kitchen. The recorder is in a neighbouring room. Perfect. Let's commence. This piece of wadding was in the wound. From a newspaper. It doesn't weigh much. Just the weight to hang someone. Bring the guns from the farm. And bring in the Frémont woman. Oh heck! What the... Oh! Filthy! Approach! Your name, first name, age, status. I am La Michel, judge. La Michel, wife of Frémont. We're asking you for your maiden name. Ah, I'm a Soulasse. We're all natives of Meung-sur-Loire. When were you born? - In '70. At the apples What? The apples? In August, I mean. 20th August, the time of the first apples Michèle Soulasse, Mrs Frémont, born 20th August 1770 in Meung-sur-Loire. - Sit down. Tell us what you know. Take care, at the first lie I will charge you with complicity! Complicity?! What's he going on about? Me, an accomplice?! You know the enemies of your master? I know nothing about that. But everyone hated him here! He was hard on everyone he knew. Hard and greedy! You need to look at everyone. Look... it'll be because of the wood, you need to look into the wood... Do you think it's natural, when you own a forest, to moan about a log to heat the kettle? That day, I only had one log. I was making my way back with my wood supply when I thought I heard voices from the small room where Pierre sleeps. It's just sugared water. - You can rely on me for everything Take it easy tomorrow, he won't appear. Don't leave me. Not yet. Does he know you're here? He's capable of seemingly knowing nothing in the hope of seeing me die here one day, like an animal! You won't leave me, will you? Always spying on us, that weasel! This'll end badly, all this. This'll end badly Who's he, this one? - He's looking for work. A vagabond. If the master finds him here... One doesn't refuse a bowl of soup to a Christian. It's me who said he could come here. Give him a bowl. I'm going back to the forest. Sons of bitches from Larçay have cut down three trees, part of their on-going revenge. When the master sees this... there's going to be trouble. However, don't dally all the same. The master is not very charitable. He seems tough, your master. - You don't poach in his woods. You can't even glean a twig. And to his servants?... - A tyrant. We have moments of respite when he's in his inkwell. He writes a great deal? - He loves his paperwork! Sometimes, the lamp burns all night. He won't stop writing This has already caused considerable trouble. He's wrong to be too learned. What's the point of all your sciences if it's just to vomit forth wicked books? Everyone can read. And wicked ideas spread fast. Yes! And he believes in neither God nor the Devil. And he blasphemes as well! "He who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit, according to the apostle, he will never be forgiven.. And woe to the blind bile that leads the gullible into hell." Why are you telling me this? It's written in the Gospels. Let's leave it there. And his wife? What's she like? - You ask a lot of questions. I let you in and chat with you, but do I know where you've come from? Eat up. The sooner you go, the better. I've told you to draw a mark on the chimney when you put a log on the fire! You didn't leave me the time. - You don't obey my orders! Everyone mocks me and I'm paying for it all! Who are you?! I'm looking for work. There's none here! On a farm, there's usually something needs doing. I'm not asking much. I don't like vagabonds! Your hands are too delicate for a worker and too clean to ask for alms! You should leave. Get out! And quicker than this! Can't I finish my soup? Here. Here. Here it is, your soup! That scoundrel should be in an asylum! Is this how you run the farm?! In the end I'll have to throw you all out. All of you! Who'd serve a grouse like you? No more bacon? There was a huge chunk! You've had it. - Certainly not! You must've put it all in the soup! Here! Here! I was sure of it! Where are the marks on this oil bottle? Everything's been wasted! Thrown away! Frittered! Run down! Lost! And the eggs in the basket, are you the only one to have counted them? For the accounts, ask Frémont. Where is he? - He was here. They've cut down three more of your trees by Larçay. The bandits! 3 trees? That's quite a trimming. They want to ruin me! They'll see what kind of wood I'm made from! Yes, yes, on condition that they leave me at least a little wood. To hell with expressions already made! And Pierre is there? I saw him. - "Saw him"! Pierre! Pierre! Making me count the eggs, the logs... I don't know how to count! Complaining we ate too much, that miser! Abominable! Indecent and abominable. - Who are you? The Marquis de Siblas. Your minions managed to get in before me. I don't know what's up with the servants! It's indecent! That woman speaks of the poor victim in terms most injurious. We are investigating, Marquis... - De Siblas. Precisely. I wanted to see for myself. Please sit down. You were a close friend of Mr. Courier. - He was an exceptional man. Exceptional men have few close friends. And they cannot be understood through the accounts of a few simple servants. But their testimonies all agree. - They portray a mean, miserly egoist. - He had to be frugal out of necessity. A pamphleteer has to be miserly. But he was devoted to the public good. The public good is order. Order is the king. Let's not forget that. Mr. Courier lived surrounded by enemies. Political. Any pamphleteer has political enemies. Defending one side means attacking the other. I was witness to his most effective actions. Interesting. In what circumstances? Those in Luynes, in 1816. Excuse me for not accompanying you home. A doctor is always on call. - No need. The night is peaceful. It's one night when the gods have taken a break from tormenting men and where you can stand guard against death I wish I was enough. And thank you again for the expertise in the manuscript, Mr. Courier. These amateurs that buy these manuscripts! - He'll attribute it to Paracelsus. It's a forgery. - Without it, the doctor would probably have to rely on the stars to cure the peasants. No, the moon mocks our pain. - Anyway, your expertise did the trick. - Since Florence, I'm wary of manuscripts. - That whole ink stain saga? On the precious parchment. Smearing a writer with ink stains? It's amusing. My pamphlets will be soon forgotten. My stain on the Longus' manuscript will remain. I can hear from here the foul tongues of posterity: "Courier, that writer whose works have long been forgotten, but who out of jealousy, defaced the least manuscript he could get his hands on". Halt! - We're on our way home. Halt! Open up! But he's done nothing! I'm telling you he's done nothing! Take him away! I've done nothing! - Gendarme sir! Hiding yourself under the bed! Like a rat! Open the door! Oh, the bitch! She scratched me! Murderers, murderers. Murderers. Daddy! Daddy! Are they going to kill them all? Why are you arresting these people? Why?! He won't answer. - I am squadron commander. Why are they being arrested? - I have my orders. That's not a reason. - I obey orders without reason. This is a disgrace! - They've done nothing. We should go to the mayor! - They'll arrest you. The mayor is in the pocket of the ultras, but he won't dare do anything. What good would it do? - A question of honour. Nice government these ultras have! - Ah, the emperor! They make a mockery of individual freedom! Don't take me away Don't take me away! Don't take me away! Don't take me away! He won't appear. - He'll appear! Traitors don't take responsibility for their actions. He's comfortable hiding under his bed, he'll appear! Gentlemen, why the racket? We want you to tell us! I was asleep. - Ah! Terror reigns in the village, people are being arrested, and the mayor was asleep! - Is your village a den of brigands? - Why this assault? This invasion of Luynes by French uniforms? I know nothing about it. - You refuse to speak? The orders must come from the prefecture in Tours. You exaggerate the incident. To hear you all Luynes is on fire and drenched in blood. All for a few seditious types! They're guilt of sedition then?! Of course. You didn't know? It's just a few fanatics, some stroppy Bonapartists, republicans. - Didn't you take an oath to Bonaparte when the sun shone on the Empire? Your opinions evolve with the governments. Yesterday, you shouted "Long live the emperor!", today it's "Long live the King!" And tomorrow, you'll be shouting "Long live the Republic!" Nobody can enter people's homes at night. Not even the gendarmes! They've torn up the Constitution! - If I was in government, I'd pick up the lot. - The gendarmes are from the government. You think you can send this paper to the constitutionalists in 12 hours? - And to our friends in both chambers. Okay. "Gentlemen, I am from Tours, and I live in Luynes, somewhere that was once considerable but the revoking of the edict of Nantes reduced to 1000 inhabitants, and that we'll reduce to none unless your prudence takes over. There cannot be in Luynes 10 known crooks, 10 killers living. I affirm that within a 100 leagues of Paris, in a remote ignored village, which one can't reach except by impassable tracks, there cannot be 10 guilty of sedition, 10 enemies of the state and King." - What's all this? A summary of your exploits. - A report, eh? Indeed. Sent up the chain of command. If it's the chain of command... "And yet at midnight, your gendarmes rode in on horseback, arriving at the gates of Luynes. Slaughtering the watchmen they entered. And by all too familiar measures, they seized a woman, a barber, a clog-maker, 4 or 5 labourers, and the monarchy is safe! Luynes is half the size of the royal palace." In any event they had no reason to arrest in Luynes 10 people, when in Paris there are 100,000 guilty of the same thing! The emergency powers must be abolished! Villèle should dissolve both chambers! Injustice has driven these peasants to revolt. The terror wasn't ended to put vengeance in its place. Paul-Louis Courier... Troops will spread to the whole of France like a wildfire. Down with the emergency powers! Ask for "Le Constitutionnel"! Paul-Louis Courier... Courier, arrest him! Arrest him! Long live the King! Read the petition of Paul-Louis Courier! Read the petition of Paul-Louis Courier! Down with Courier! Stop there! All this has very little to do with the crime. I'm telling you what I do. - I'm astonished that you sing the praises of this pamphleteer. The works of your friend should have been prosecuted under law. Did you really mean that, sir? Paul-Louis Courier has already been condemned by justice, but between us, let's talk like two men of the law without malice. Do you have a soft spot for the enemies of the King? God forbid. But an enemy who prefers study to the glory of arms, the solitude of a village to success in the court, and translates decadent Greek authors, seems to me a worthy rival. - Why would he take refuge on this isolated farm if it was not to write his poisonous works with impunity and in secret? His taste in style. He loved the country language. In sum, reading Homer gave him the dignified style of Mr. Voltaire. Call Pierre Dubois. Pierre Dubois! Pierre! Pierre! Pierre. They're calling you. Re-saddle the horse of the marquis. Thank you once again for these unforgettable hours. - If I wasn't so pressed, I'd let you see a Virgil quarto published in 1460. Another time. I'd like to find that this has become a successful dairy. Will you grant me the honour of a visit? Impossible. At the moment, with my work, my headaches, my time is precious. Anytime you can... I noticed your little game! What game? - Your little glances, your provocative airs. - Are you jealous? Evidently, he has the time to waste to dandify himself and to please women. Against me, with my face scarred by the war and my being 25 years older than you, he has an easy conquest, that gavotte dancer. Contain yourself in front of the servants. I'll never be handsome. But does my talent mean nothing to you? What will remain of him in 100 years? My writings, they... You'll tell me they'll be forgotten in 100 years. For the moment I'm an old bear! Yes, an old bear. One against the world, fighting for liberty, ripping into those dogs in power! That counts more than... a nice garb. How can an ironist lose his sense of the ridiculous on this point? He goes too far, the master! - Yes, but watch out. In the village, at least, in case the tongues start wagging about him. They've started to talk because of you. Say, it's not jealousy that's got you talking like this? As if I could be jealous dragging this leg along... You've never noticed? Who did I see in the village? - Go away! Who did I see in the village? - Your brother! I don't have a brother. - Yes, the one that goes: hee-haw! - The donkey is more patient than you. Now he's a wit! - Guess who I saw? Clear off or I'll boot you in the arse! I won't tell you I saw Coupeau. Impossible. What did he tell you? - I don't know... Oh yes, he told me about his party. It's the day after tomorrow. April 10th. So what? He said: "If they push on to Azay, they'll have an onion skin." It's good, onion skin. It lets you see things you don't normally see. That's your news?! - We go there every Sunday. To play cards. I've something for you, master! Here! Here. The devil with your fooling! Give it! What's this about? You know someone with a shotgun? Mr. Frémont has a shotgun. - And? And you. And Mr. Pierre. - Pierre Dubois? A shotgun all shiny. Madame gave it to him. 50 Louis. A gift of 50 Louis! I'm asked to foot the bill. Wait a moment. I'll offer him a gift, this arsehole of a Don Juan! Come with me. OF WHAT HAPPENS TO THOSE THAT CUCKOLD THEIR SPOUSE WITH A GROOM. Put this in Madame's bedroom. Put it in front of her mirror. Make sure you're not seen. The necklace from my balls when I was young. These balls are supposed to be fun. You couldn't imagine. All that joyfulness in the music all that luxury, all those grandiose refinements, it was... like one was in another world. - Why did you leave Paris? Don't interrupt! He gave me a fright. I'll box his ears! He threw a book. - He's interested in reading? Oh, what the heck! Why do you burn it? Show it to me! It would be better not to. - I want to see it! Are you mad? My husband's writing. This surpasses all. One doesn't give gifts like this to the servants without reasons that you will explain to me! How much do I owe for your pains? 40F for this month. And 160 for the last 4 months. That makes 200F. - You have an hour to get out! Why? - You are too much the master! Your behaviour is obnoxious! - You...! Here are the invoices of your overwhelming largesse! Don't count on me anymore for gifts to your servants! Is that clear?! Pack your bags. - And if I won't let him go! And if I refuse to go? - Scoundrel! You dare defy me? You threaten me in my own home?! I should call the gendarmes! They should arrest you! I'll never be in prison! But you with your writings, your filth against the King... you'll know it, prison! - Idiot! If you're trying to scare me... Get out right now! Right now! Out! Swine! Never will I forgive this! - He's chasing me out! I'll kill him like a dog. Like a dog! There's no need to embellish the truth, my friend. Admit you carried out your threats. Anger is a good excuse for many things. I threatened him but I didn't kill him! Dubois, you recognise Mme Courier's shotgun? No. I didn't have it for very long. You can retire. Yes, well, this... this shotgun has been cleaned. Is this all? - All? This is Mr. Courier's, but it's all rusty. That one belonged to the gamekeeper. And the shotgun offered to Dubois? - Yes, indeed. Stolen. And where's he living now, this Pierre Dubois? Outside the village, at Marshall... I'm going! And bring in Frémont. Frémont! Frémont. You recognise this shotgun? Of course. It's mine. Yours? It looks well used. - Yes, seeing I'm the gamekeeper. There's no shortage of poachers around here. I always fire in the air. I haven't wounded many people yet. The forest was everything to him. It was his life. That branch, can't ignore it. Wait, I'm going to have them. Hey, over there! Have you no shame? - We're just collecting dead wood. This is my land. - But it's just dead wood! That's what they all say! Have they bought a licence for faggots? You have your licences? - 1 écu for dead wood! No licence, no wood. - It's ours, this wood. Oh yes? - Leave that! It's not right! The wood belongs to whoever finds it. If you did your job, this wouldn't happen. Here's Phorien bringing in the hay. Since I showed that rascal the door, I see him everywhere. Watch them. And if you find him on the farm, I trust you won't miss him. Who you spying on? I saw your game with the drill. Just you wait! I'll tan your hide! Just you wait! I'll tan your hide! I'll keep quiet. - If you talk, the master will kick you out and you'll go back to begging. All the time you do what you're told, La Michel will never forget your plate, nor the occasional glass of wine. Don't you like wine? - Yes, when it's good. Come along then. Come on. Come on! Should I climb up? - Yes, climb up. Be careful. Grab this. There. Hide it in the vat. François! François! Yes! You wouldn't have hidden my saddle? No, mistress. It's not another one of your pranks? No. Tell the truth! Maybe, mistress. Tell me the truth! Where's my saddle? This moron's hidden it. Are you going to say where you put it? It'll take some brains... to get out of him what he's done with it. Where's he gone now? Pass me the grapes. Ah! Get off me! Will you get off me?! What brutes! - It's me who will drink! Mine! Keep your yobbishness for the girls at the inn! After the gunshot, I went to see if he wasn't prostrate behind the wall. But he'd long since fled. At the time of the crime, where were you? At Coupeau's, with Pierre and Symphorien Dubois. We were playing cards like every Sunday. - You have witnesses? Yes. Coupeau for a start. He must remember it clearly because that Sunday, it was his party. And some peasants must have seen us pass by. Very good. You were also at Coupeau's? - As you say. We go there every Sunday. That day, it was... Coupeau's party. I'm sure of it. - So who do you think had a motive to murder your master? Who wanted to kill him? How can I put it? Lots of people didn't like him, that's true. But enough to slay him?... You didn't like your master. Why was that? He was against the emperor. And with all due respect, prosecutor sir, that's enough reason for me, being against the emperor. It's not that we're more proud than anyone else, but when you pay for it personally... I'll always remember Saint Vincent's Sunday. When Madame Courier was on the way to the church at Azay. Here we are. Don't forget me in your prayers. - You'll go drinking with who knows who. You'll confess to who knows what. He leaves her to enter alone. Yet it costs nothing to pray. To have one of our own arrested, do you know what the prosecutor wrote to the gendarmerie? He wrote, admire the politeness, commander, please have arrested and put in prison such-and-such of such place!" - We are not more courteous. Please, it's like the saying goes 'make me your friend, do me this service, before anything else I am your servant.' The king's prosecutor serves the gendarme who if needs be will be his. That Paul-Louis has guts! - The king's prosecutor surely writes to the executioner: "Executioner, be so kind as to cut off the head of such-and-such and I am your servant. About taxes: That the People pay is the axiom of all times and of all government. - Shout that in the square and the gendarmes will stop you. - The French people pride themselves in nurturing those who take care of their own business. Therefore, it is never lacking. The people are made to pay. - Mr. Courier! I was reading your articles. - Hello, my friends. Without you, nobody would protest. - Who's going to chastise the ultras? A pitcher! - Thanks. It amazes me to see all France impassioned by our peasant stories. - Parisians care about the arrest of some poor bugger? - Is an arbitrary act more tolerable in Veretz or Larçay than in Paris? The idea of a petty injustice is as absurd as the idea of a petty crime. - Look out, here's the mayor. I've given the order to close this cabaret on Sundays! Is this the letter? I wanted to show it to Mr. Courier. Mr. Courier can change nothing. My decree has the force of law. Is it approved by the prefecture? - No. It doesn't have to be. A mayor has the duty to maintain order in his commune. By arresting half the population to reassure the other half. I don't want a hotbed of revolution in front of the church. And Sunday is a day of rest. - We're resting. As you can well see. You think I don't know what's going on here? You're plotting against the government and the state. You organise political meetings! - At what number does it become a meeting? - At more than one. You're making fun of me! This cabaret will remain closed! If you won't leave, I'll call the gendarmes to intervene! - Well, I'm staying! You're like the rest... - Don't get het up. You're right. Going to the cabaret on Saint Vincent's day is shameful. - That's what I was trying to tell you. But let's be reasonable, please. Saint Vincent loved winemakers since he's their patron. He must love the vine and the wine and thus the cabaret. How could he find it bad to go to the cabaret on his feast day? Landlord, a bottle. Let's drink to the health of Saint Vincent. This will come back to haunt you! - This afternoon, mayor, at the dance! There won't be any dance! And this cabaret remains closed Sundays! I forbid the cabaret... and I forbid the dance! Choose your knight. Dance, your age should. Mr. Courier. Will our village Caesar... dare ban the dance? Phorien, won't you dance? With my wooden leg? Piedmont girls danced well. The emperor gave us drinks. You gave him your leg! I lost my leg at Marengo. And I'm proud of it! If he came marching back... - You'd offer him the other one. Truly, tyrants have all the fun! I'm saying nothing, but there was no chance he'd lose his leg, him. But he was an officer. - He tore off his stripes. You know what that means, do you? Notice: the mayor informs his citizens that the dance has been banned, a report will be made against offenders. It's illegal! Such orders must come from the préfecture! Go home! - We won't let this happen! You should talk to them, Mr. Courier. Don't go! Nobody has the right to chase you out of this place! The mayor is abusing his power. Many of you have come not to dance but to talk shop, to sell what you couldn't sell at the fair. In banning this dance, they act against the public interest and against everyone! Bravo! Resume the dance and let the mayor foot the bill. What's so wrong about dancing in front of the church? Our fathers used to do it. The sainted King David danced in front of the ark and "the Lord was put at ease", say the scriptures. If you accept this, they'll soon come, with drums, to prevent you singing and laughing. You will fast by edict of the mayor. Bravo! MUSIC! MUSIC! MUSIC. MUSIC! 1, 2, 3... # On the village green where a good time can be heard, # # on the village green, dance to villanelles. # # Not the priest nor the mayor # # can stop it. # # Go on, spin girls! Go on, spin guys! # # On the village green, dance to villanelles # # to the sound of the wind in the branches # # and to the sound of the wind through the wheat. # # Not the priest nor the mayor can stop you. # # Go on, spin girls! Go on, spin guys! # Him, stirring up rebellion, he's always there. That man is dangerous. - He spends his time writing pamphlets, manisfestoes. - Anonymous writings, eh? He favours corruption. - If I could... Between us, he forces his wife to read such things... I couldn't tell you what. Impossible?! - You can see the result. What do you expect? When someone's for liberty... # Not the priest nor the mayor can stop you. # No! No! I don't want to be interrogated! I don't want... Is this really necessary? Any detail could be important. Why are you so afraid? We mean you no harm. What were you doing in the forest at the time of the crime? The forest is mine! I always hide there in the forest. They don't care about me, in the village. But in the forest, it's me that can frighten others It's me that can hunt the animals in their burrows. There, I can eat without needing permission, scare hedgehogs so that they roll up into a ball or whistle lizards, birds... squirrels... and all the little creatures. Efface in the lake my ugly mug. Often, the small need me to defend them against attackers. Stop! It wasn't me! - It was him! We were just playing. He said he was going to take me to his big house. And that nobody would beat me anymore. So, he took me by the hand to show me. It seemed to me that even the shadows were singing. I was so happy, so carefree! I would have danced on a ray of the sun. It seemed to me that the two of us walked on a path of light to his palace. Were you treated well, at La Chavonnière? Oh, very well, you know. Master, master. He's beating me again! François, I don't like to be disturbed. But they beat me! They don't like my being here. They say that you should never have taken me in. They'll kill us both. - Who wants to kill us? All of them, master. Frémont, Saphorien, La Michel, the man in the Grey hat, Dubois, the Marquis de Siblas. Come on. Calm down, François. There's only one dangerous enemy: the unknown fanatic. Who's the unknown fanatic? - Against him, there's no defense. He kills kings. - But I'm not a king. He has no reason to kill you then! You'll pay for that, old skinflint! Old skinflint! Old skinflint! Old skinflint! Old skinflint! Help! Departing thus this poor world! He couldn't take it with him! If the master disappeared, we'd be much happier. If only the master disappeared... If only the master disappeared... If he disappeared... If he disappeared... - If he disappeared... If he disappeared... - If he disappeared... If he disappeared... If he disappeared... - If he disappeared... IF THE MASTER DISAPPEARED! IF THE MASTER DISAPPEARED! Fire! Master! Master! Master! Come on... I see you well loved him, your master. I won't ask you any more. Come in. I've finally got that gun! There's still some burnt powder in the barrel! The other is loaded. - With this evidence we have the killer. Well, aren't I right? - Let's hope so. But Mrs. Courier may have something to tell us on the subject of this weapon. Ask her to come here. Call Mrs. Courier! - Frémont! Call Madame! Madame! Madame! Madame! Madame! It's a sad affair. And a bit more serious for you, I think, than it first appeared. Please. Your husband was receiving an important correspondence. Was he not? Certainly. He was very well known. Especially in political circles. This is not the issue. Did he receive lots of printed material, manifestoes, gazettes, or newspapers? Newspapers? No, I didn't see any. He only subscribed to the "Feuilleton" among political newspapers. Now that's an interesting work.. He had a subscription? Yes. Okay. When he was keeping his journal, was he in the habit of keeping in it certain annotated articles, that he had cut out or something similar? - No. I gave the old newspapers to the kitchen. For lighting the fire. From time to time, didn't you give them to the servants? To Pierre Dubois, for example. - Pierre Dubois? What a strange idea. No, I don't remember doing so. Okay, okay. And this shotgun, that was used to kill your husband, couldn't it have been stuffed... with pieces of that paper? How awful. How could I know? They might have been stolen from the kitchen. You are not imagining that I killed my husband? Bring back Pierre Dubois. Pierre Dubois, you recognise this weapon? Of course. It's the shotgun that Madame Courier gave me. The master took it back from me immediately. You recognise this newspaper? Yes. Mrs. Courier lent them to me to read "L'ermite en liberté". The serial novel by Benjamin Constant. Yes. Some numbers were missing and I never found out how it ended. Liar. Me? You had every number! The ones you're missing, you used them as wadding for this shotgun! Your shotgun! - But I never had it! Why was it at your house? At my house?! No! You're entrapping me! If I'd committed murder with it, I wouldn't have kept the gun! You can tell that to the court. You had emotional motives to commit this crime. Jealousy and greed, here's the moral evidence. - It's untrue! The material evidence: this shotgun and the paper in the barrel. It's false! - I'm charging you with the premeditated murder of P.-L. Courier. No, I didn't kill him! He's right, sir. He wasn't the killer. - How do you know? I was there... Then you're leaving? This departure is final? - You said it. Have you thought through the consequences? Anything's better than this life tucked away between your jealousy and your avarice. I didn't imagine, when I married you, I would become a farm girl. I didn't imagine it either! Listen my love, I have a confession to make. My financial situation, since I resigned from the army... The thing is... this farm is our only asset. Sell it. - So you can take a slice? How would we live, afterwards? - Regardless, I'm leaving. It's up to you if you join me. Allow me to reflect on it. I've nothing left to reflect on. Here I am! Hey, excuse me. Excuse me! Tell the postmaster to forward my mail to my mother's. - Madame intends to go on horseback to Paris? - No. I'll push on to Tours to greet some old friends. - The stagecoach hasn't been through. Madame won't arrive before nightfall. Goodbye. Mistress! Stop! Stop! Mistress, stop! Stop! Mistress, stop! Don't go, mistress! They want to kill the master! More of your gibberish. They're going to kill the master! - Who's "they"? Them at La Chavonnière and the prowler with the Grey cap! We must go! They're going to kill him! Where? - There, in the woods! In Larçay? At 5pm, he's due to show Frémont the new logging. If this is true... Bring me, mistress! I want to come! Mistress! Mistress! Mistress! Let's give him something he won't forget! I'm a doomed man! Wretches, what have you done?! - He's dead all right. He'll do no more harm. Come on, little lady, you've nothing to complain about. - You'll have a peaceful life now. Shut up, drunkard! Clear off quick! You probably don't know, Madame, all the harm your husband did. He was an enemy of the monarchy, like before he was that of the Empire. Agitators of this sort often come to sticky ends... strange sticky ends. You were going to Tours, I believe. Go on, and don't talk to anyone about this. There they all go. Case closed. All except the man in the Grey hat, surely the instigator of the crime. You believe in this man with the Grey hat? Who saw him? An idiot, a crotchety old woman. -And Mrs. Courier. Oh, Mrs. Courier. She is highly impressionable, Mrs. Courier... Her nerves were put under such a strain that on this point, we can hardly take her account seriously. However... - Forget about it! We've caught four murderers. - Farm servants. The servants were the actors, and the setting, the farm of the seven sins. A political plot would give ammunition to the enemies of the King. You have progressive ideas but even so... I had the impression that they were all lying and that it really was a political assassination. Like the victim, it needs to be buried. All right, but then it will be necessary to also bury his books, his journals, his manifestoes. And all the man's ideas. However an idea, one thinks it's under control and it gets away from you. One gets forgotten another gets rediscovered. And it takes flight in eternity. Master!
