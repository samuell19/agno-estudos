[CHANTING INDISTINCTLY] [WOMAN SCREAMING FAINTLY] [BIRDS CHIRPING] IZZY: Thank you. - [DOG BARKING EXCITEDLY] - [IZZY CHUCKLES] TOMMY: Mommy! [IZZY GASPS] ETHAN: Do you know who this is? Hi, Lily. I'm your mom. [DOG CONTINUES BARKING] ETHAN: Welcome home. TOMMY: Mommy, you have to see what I made. IZZY: What? What did you make? Look, it's a two-way radio. - You did this all by yourself? - Mmm-hmm. It still needs work before I'll be able to talk to you in Afghanistan. I never would have been able to do that at your age. It's very impressive, Tommy. I'll put this in your room. Those scars say a lot about you. What? That I went to war a doctor and came back a soldier, like you said I would? No. Don't. You know, most of them are on your front, not on the back. It tells me my wife was always facing danger. She never ran away. Tells me you're a hero. Is that really how you feel about me now? I'm a hero? For going to war after giving birth to our baby girl. That fight we had... Whoa. You've never done that before. Sorry. [IZZY EXHALES] But I didn't say, I don't like it. [OWL HOOTING] [EERIE VOICE WHISPERING INDISTINCTLY] WOMAN: Emily? Did you fight in the war? [GASPS] [DOOR CREAKING] [MUSIC PLAYS OVER RADIO] [TOY SQUEAKS] [RADIO STATIC BUZZING] [RADIO TURNS OFF] [TOY SQUEAKS] [LILY CRYING LOUDLY] [ETHAN SINGING IN OTHER LANGUAGE] Hey, Love. You okay? What's this? It's Tiki Totem. Brought it back from Hawaii. The natives believe that it brings good luck. Hello there. [LILY COOS] Hey. She has your eyes. I'll give you two a minute, okay. Hey, bye-bye. - Bye-bye. - [LILY COOS] Hey, let's get you into bed. [LILY CONTINUES COOING] [FLOORBOARDS CREAKING] [WHISPERING] Tommy, what are you doing here? [WHISPERING] Just watching over Lily, Mom. Come, I'll tuck you into bed. TOMMY: You should read Daddy's book about Hawaii. He never shares his work with me until he's done. Then don't tell him about it. He keeps it in his study behind his new book. - He's writing a new book? - A book for children. Come, let's get you to bed. I'm sure we can still get you to your piano class in time, Emma. I'm not playing piano anymore. - What? But you used to love... - Oh, you know teenagers. Love the things they used to hate, hate the things they used to love. Including us. Uh, look, we can just take the bus. - I'm sure, it's nothing. - Well, I'm pretty sure, it is. [RADIO STATIC BUZZES] [RADIO STATIC CONTINUES] So, that's where my wrench went. How about you help me out with the car? - Still working on that radio? - TOMMY: It's much better now. I talk to Daddy when he's asleep. IZZY: How is that even possible? Tommy, having an imagination is one thing. Lying is quite another. Tesla said, one day we'll be able to talk to people in other dimensions. IZZY: How about you hand me that wrench? Tom, could you grab an extension too? Sure, be right back. [WATER RUNNING] Tom. Stop playing games. You're wasting water! [GRUNTS] [CAR CREAKING] [GASPS] [METAL THUDS] [METAL CREAKING] [PANTING] [METAL CLANGING] Bee! [TOMMY BREATHING HEAVILY] It's okay. It's okay. [PANTING] Where does Dad keep your EpiPen? [GASPING] - You okay? - [PHONE BEEPING] [MAN OVER PHONE] Emergency services, which service do you require? Hi, hi, I have an emergency. My son's allergic to bees and he's just... I'm fine, Mommy. You don't have to take me. Just a second. Tommy, you need to go to the hospital. Last time it happened, Dad didn't take me. He didn't? - Uh, nev-never mind, so-sorry. - Okay. You'll tell me if you feel strange, right? Okay. Uh... Tommy. Did you notice any sound of water in the garage just now? I want to show you Dad's work before he comes back from town. Tommy, that's called snooping. It's called having an interest in what your parents do for a living! [SIGHS] Do you know that demons can enter people? This is a Mujina. A woman without a face. Dad says her name is Akela. Tommy. I'm not sure how comfortable I am with us messing up your dad's study. I'll do it quickly to relieve you of your discomfort as soon as possible! These are the Night Marchers. One look into their eyes can suck you in forever. Spells. See, a whole book filled with chants. A kahuna did one on me to protect me! ETHAN: Scary stuff, isn't it? And if you look at that, you can't really blame me for wanting to write something for children, can you? Tommy, could I have a moment with your dad please? Ethan, you're a professor at Oxford commissioned to explore the early Polynesian history of the Hawaiian culture, I mean, why the sudden interest of writing children books? Look at all this. I mean, all these things! They're just things to you and me. We call them what the natives call them, at the end of the day, it's just stuff we're interested in. And we study it like we dissect insects. Look. This is Mali. I met her on my research trip to Hawaii. I pretended to believe her when she told me what she believed in. I sucked all her most intimate stories out of her, for what, to sell it to the world. Making people care about how she sees the world. What's wrong with that? I'm making the whole world want to visit Hawaii, and then turn whatever makes her special into some cheap tourist attractions. That's what's wrong. I want to go back. I want to return all the artefacts. Maybe it'll be good for you too, good for us. We could turn it into a family holiday. You've never exploited anyone. I only just got back. - I missed it. - I know. [TOMMY CHANTING IN OTHER LANGUAGE] [CONTINUES CHANTING] Tommy, what are you doing? Doing the spell to protect me against bad things happening. The one the kahuna taught me. Nothing bad's going to happen to you. I'm here to protect you. I love you. Come on, let's go get something to eat. TOMMY: [WHISPERING] Did you know that demons can enter people? [WATER FLUSHING] [DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES] We need to talk about Tommy. - I'm worried about him. - Mmm-hmm. [LILY CRYING OVER MONITOR] [GASPS] [BREATHING HEAVILY] Forgive me for being crude, but you're not crazy, you know. Excuse me? Here's my card. Don't let them know, I've given that to you. It's bad for business, if patients realize they're not "patients" after all. But... There is something... ominous that surrounds your home. Ah. Give me a ring when that makes sense to you. Mrs. Cormack, the doctor will see you now. - [RADIO STATIC BUZZES] - [MUSIC PLAYS] [STATIC INCREASES] [MUSIC SCRAMBLES] [GASPS] Izzy, what are you doing? I came back from the doctor and found this. - I want to know, who did it and why... - Tommy. It was Tommy. He did it, just before you got back. What? Why? I don't know. Maybe, he's just looking for attention. Tommy? Tommy, did you turn these photographs around? I'm getting to the bottom of this. All right, Tommy let's go. [BIRDS CHIRPING] [BELLS TOLLING] [PIANO MUSIC PLAYING] I remember the first time you told me you wanted to play the piano. We went to this shopping center and there was a pianist playing in the clothing department. [CHUCKLES] You stopped and asked if we could stay and listen. I sat with you for 20 minutes. [CHUCKLES] When he finished playing, you looked up at me and you said... "I'm going to do that too, Mommy." It was the first time you called me Mom. Do you remember? Emma! Emma, what have you done! Ethan! Ethan! - Izzy. - Dial the ambulance. What, what's the matter? Wha-wha... Where's Emma? [GASPS] No. No. Call the ambulance. Izzy, but what happened? What's going on? Emma. Emma. Emma. Emma. [BREATHING HEAVILY] Where's Emma? She's at her mom's, I left you a note. No, you didn't. She hates staying there. Okay, she didn't want me to tell you. Where is Emma? - She's staying at a friend's house. - No. No! - She's almost 18, we... - No! It's not that! Look, I'll show you, come! It's all on camera, look. And? Emma was there, I was talking to her. What's that? Well, that's just the light from the window. The... The piano, you heard the piano, right? - You're lying to me! - Izzy, Izzy... Why don't you tell me what happened to you in Marjah. It has nothing to do with that! - Are you taking your pills? - Yes. - And it wasn't a hallucination. - Listen to me. Why don't we take that family holiday I've been talking about? I really think a short break will do you good. I'm not stressed, Ethan. The doctor said... Did you see that? There. It's just Tommy. And you look pretty stressed to me. See. I'm not leaving till I figure this out. Okay. RICHARD: Hello, Elizabeth. How did you know it was me calling? I sense it's an emergency. IZZY: You can set up in here. Uh, may I ask that we get the formalities out of the way? Listen, my husband believes it's easier to indulge in the eternal after completing material matters. Oh, of course. - Thank you. - ETHAN: Um, hello? Ethan, I asked Richard to come here to perform a seance. Uh. Good afternoon. I'm Richard Turner, this is Hugh... Mmm-hmm. Yeah. Can I speak to you for a moment? Sure. I'll be right back. - Who are these people? - Look... I met Richard at the psychologist's office, and he just understood what was wrong with me without me saying anything. And then, and then I called him, and he knew we needed help. So, this stalker is hitting on women with mental problems in a psychologist's office? It's so unlike you to be jealous and Richard's gay. Look, I know this doesn't make much sense to you and to be quite frank, it doesn't make much sense to me... No, no, it makes perfect sense. Don't you see? He pays the receptionist to get information on patients. He puts your number in his phone and he knows when you're calling. Then he sells you some whack-job spiritual mumbo jumbo. Look, I'm not asking you to understand, but I just want you to respect... - I'm getting these people out of my house. - No. I went to see a psychologist for you. Now this is for me, and you will respect that. I'm taking the children to a hotel. Come on, Ethan, you're overreacting. What, I'm overreacting? Ever since you've been back, you've been a disaster. And I'm overreacting? Emma? Tommy! - IZZY: I do apologize. - Please. No need for apologies. This can be very difficult for a family. Please, sit. I will try to communicate, what I can to you. Please feel free to ask any questions whilst I'm in it. In what? You'll see. Hugh will be recording everything from here. This night-vision camera can detect ectoplasm, the substance astral bodies leave behind. And our white noise machine catches frequencies humans have a hard time hearing. [MACHINE WHIRRING] Sometimes we find something, but it's not a sure thing. Just remember, whatever happens... stay calm. Stay seated. Do not attempt to make physical contact with a spirit. It is not safe. [BREATHES DEEPLY] [BREATHES DEEPLY] RICHARD: Someone is here. [VOICES WHISPERING INDISTINCTLY] A... A woman. A woman who lived here. She is attached to this place. What does she want? Something's bothering her. Something's wrong. She wants... What is it? Are you okay? [SHRIEKING] The demon's inside! [VOICES WHISPERING INDISTINCTLY] [SPEAKING IN OTHER LANGUAGE] [SPEAKING IN OTHER LANGUAGE] [HUGH SCREAMS] [GASPING] There is a presence here. [BOTH BREATHING HEAVILY] What does it want? RICHARD: Something dark. Your family is in great danger. This house needs a proper cleansing. Can you... Can you do it? HUGH: He needs to rest. - Oh, thank you. - We'll have to come back another day. - Ethan, Ethan, I have proof that I... - ETHAN: Yeah? What? Izzy? What? What... ETHAN: Come on, Izzy, what is this? - Huh? You there? - IZZY: Huh, yeah. I'm still here. Ethan, you were right. You were right about everything, I-I... Please, come back so we can talk. [SIGHS] I'm such a fool. - [GASPS] - [VEHICLE APPROACHING] We didn't go past the corner shop. There's no way I'm gonna give up on you that easily. What should I do? Our bags are packed, why don't you get yours? Then we'll go on that holiday. [SNIFFLES] Emma, can you get the keys from the postbox? You'll love it, it was so great last time. All right, Tommy? Home, sweet home. EMMA: You can't say it. TOMMY: Humu-naka... EMMA: Wrong. Then you say. Humuhumunukunukuapua'a. - You're making that up. - No, it's a real fish. I'll show you one in the lagoon. Fine. Tommy, why don't you go with your sister? Could be fun. I have to walk through the bees. The bees don't really come out of the hive. You can always walk through the house. See how high you can go. Whoa! [BEES BUZZING] Ahhh! Whoo! [OBJECT RUBBING] [OBJECT RUBBING] [RUBBING CONTINUES] [PANTING] [BABY CRYING] [IZZY SCREAMS] [PANTING] Mommy? Have you seen my dominoes? Tommy. Why did you turn over those family photographs? You can tell me... - I didn't. - Stop lying to me! You're keeping secrets from me. Tell me! What is going on? Who were you speaking to at night over the radio? Huh? I caught you doing a chant in your room! You told me you saw a kahuna and she did a protection spell on you. What happened there? Tell me, it's important, Tommy! What are you hiding from me? [CRYING SOFTLY] I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. We can talk later. When you feel better, okay? - ETHAN: Hey. Where you going? - Hey. Listen, I've been seeing things. Hallucinations. And it's not PTSD. I've been taking the pills. How can you say it's not PTSD? That's the only thing that makes sense. Tommy told me he saw a kahuna. I didn't think anything of it at the time, but maybe she knows what's going on. Maybe she caused it. Izzy, you've just came back from war and you're a... Finish your sentence. You're my wife. So what, because I'm a woman, it has to be PTSD? You called me your hero. And you are, but this has nothing to do with you being a woman, and everything to do with you being who you are. And don't you see, you run into danger like it's not gonna hurt you. That's the thing about war. It always leaves scars, and not all of them are physical. I'm going to find that kahuna. This is not PTSD! Okay. Okay. But she's not open now. We'll go first thing in the morning and I'll go with you, Whatever it is that's wrong with you, we'll figure it out as a family. Come on. [THUNDER RUMBLING] [WOOD CREAKING] Petey? [THUNDER RUMBLING] Petey, outside, boy. [CREAKING CONTINUES] Petey, outside! Hey, we left Petey at home with the dog sitter, remember? Just go back to sleep, love. [THUNDER RUMBLING] Tommy, what's going on? Why you up? Mom? It's from the kahuna you saw. We'll go there tomorrow. Tommy? [TOMMY SHIVERING] IZZY: It's just that silly Tiki Totem. It scares me too. Can I sleep with you tonight? [THUNDER CRACKS] Of course, you can. [ETHAN CHANTING INDISTINCTLY] Oh, morning. It's my last chance to do some magic before I return it all. Don't worry. Apparently it only works if you burn specific herbs as well. - Show me. - Yeah. [BOTH CHANTING IN OTHER LANGUAGE] [BOTH CONTINUE CHANTING] [BOTH LAUGH] [KNOCKING ON DOOR] - What's wrong with that boy? - Mommy. I'll go see if he's okay. Tommy, where are we going? Tommy, where are you taking me to? What are we looking at, Tommy? He says we should get in the water. Who? He said I shouldn't say. He was saying "Why isn't Emma afraid of the water anymore?" Okay, stay here, Tommy. [GASPS] There's something pulling me, Tommy. Ethan, we found three dead bodies in the lagoon. We need to leave now. I'll call the police from the car. You go get Emma. ETHAN: Emma? Izzy, have you seen Emma? I can't find her anywhere. - Have you looked outside? - Yeah. - Emma? - Emma. - Emma. - IZZY: Emma, darling, we're leaving now. [CELL PHONE RINGING] - Is that a telephone? - Yeah. [CELL PHONE RINGING] It's the basement. Stay here and call the police. [CREAKING] [CELL PHONE CHIMING] [FLOOR CREAKING] - Hello? - EMMA: Mommy? Emma? Emma, where are you? Are you okay? Mommy. Please help me. There's a man. He wants you to follow the sound of the boiling water. Emma. Tell me. What do you see around you? - Do you hear it? Please. - [WATER BOILING] Yes. - I can hear it. - Follow it. I found the boiling water. The man says there is a table. He wants you to tie yourself to the table. Emma. Tell me what do you see around you? Please, Mommy. He's hurting me. Tie yourself to the table. Tell that man that I want to speak to him. He's hurting me. Tell him I won't follow his instructions until I speak to him. Emma? Emma, are you still there? [LAUGHING] What's wrong with you? Get that mask off. I've seen it in your dad's office. [LAUGHS] Just wanted to see how much you really love me. - If you would put your own life in danger to save mine. - Of course, I would. Yet, you didn't tie yourself to the table. Emma, something terrible has happened here and we need to go. Tie yourself to the table. Prove that you love me. That you trust me. I'm not taking any of this. We're going now. Why are you still making breakfast? Did you call the police? Uh, yeah. Of course. They're on their way. But you found Emma. She was never in any real danger. All right, we're leaving this place now. You tell your daughter to get her stuff and I'm going to get Tommy. [RADIO CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] ETHAN ON RADIO: Tommy? Tommy? - Can you hear me? - I can hear you. Tommy, we're going. - Daddy wants to talk to you. - I just saw your daddy. He's downstairs. Izzy? That's not me. You need to take Tommy and leave immediately. - What about Emma? - That's not her either. - Last time we were here... - The family from the lagoon took our bodies. - And they want yours too. - That's not possible. I tried to warn you. The pictures on the wall. The piano, and the baby monitor. We tried to scare you away from this place. Why didn't you tell me before? I tried. But they make it look like I can't be trusted. I didn't turn over the photographs. You stopped believing me, Mom. I told you. I talk to Daddy when that man's asleep - and you... - I'm sorry I didn't believe you, Tommy. We need to hide. Maybe in the tunnel. Please, leave Lily alone. [IN AMERICAN ACCENT] You have no idea how I hated talking in your husband's queer accent. Oh. Did you get the chant? It's our culture your husband wanted to steal. So, she took him and Emma for me and our daughter. Show army girl here where to go. Your mom needs a new body too. [BABY COOING] Let's try this again. Tie yourself to the table. [EMMA CHANTING IN OTHER LANGUAGE] [BOTH CONTINUE CHANTING] She's here. [BOTH CONTINUE CHANTING] [SCREAMING] [SCREAMING CONTINUES] [BOTH CONTINUE CHANTING] [BREATHING HEAVILY] Emma? Emma? - [SCREAMING] - [CREATURE GROWLING] [CREATURE SNARLS] [ALL LAUGHING] [LAUGHING CONTINUES] Hello? [BREATHING HEAVILY] Hello? [SCREAMS] [PANTING] TOMMY: Mommy, can you hear me? Mommy, follow my voice. [CREATURE SNARLS] TOMMY: Mommy. Tommy, please don't speak. [CREATURE HISSING] [GRUNTS] Tommy, can you hear me? I can hear you. I need you to go to the kitchen. There's a door in the pantry that leads to the basement. Take the tunnel and meet me there. Tommy, I need your body to fix this. You're the only one that can save us. We need to perform transference on you. It's boiling. I need you to pour it over your body from your toes to your face. Can you do that for me? TOMMY: [STUTTERS] Uh... Tommy, your whole body. No matter what happens... don't stop. Okay. [CHANTING IN OTHER LANGUAGE] [TOMMY CRYING] [TOMMY SCREAMING] [CONTINUES CHANTING] [TOMMY CONTINUES SCREAMING] [BREATHING HEAVILY] Tommy, you stay safe. Mommy loves you. [DOOR OPENING AND CREAKING] - ETHAN: Sorry, buddy. You know too much. - [BEES BUZZING] ETHAN: You gotta go. [CRASHES] [DOOR CLOSES] [COUGHING] [OBJECTS CLATTERING] Argh! [PANTING] Is something burning? Tommy. The basement. What are you still doing here? - [KNOCKING] - ETHAN: Open the door, Tommy! EMMA: I'm letting you out now! I'll deal with Tommy. [COUGHS] TOMMY: Go to sleep. [ENGINE STARTS] EMMA: Please let me out. Tommy, this isn't funny. Seriously, let me out. You've come from the house in the forest where the road ends. EMMA: Tommy! A woman lived there. People whispered she could transfer the dead into the living. I sense she was murdered with her family. But you've already been transferred, haven't you? EMMA: Tommy! It's my daughter. Emma. EMMA: Tommy, let me out now! I'm sorry. I cannot help. You've lost someone, too. A spirit you cannot get back. I was in Marjah. A girl, my son's age, was wearing an explosive vest. I shot her before she could trigger it. I know what it's like to not be able to protect the innocent. But how do you keep them safe from something you can't see? You cannot. But we are going to try. Please. We must take her back to where the transference occurred, call her name. Call her back. Let's go. [GROWLING] [BEATING STICKS] [CHANTING IN OTHER LANGUAGE] [BUBBLING] Mama? Is that you? [OBJECTS CLATTERING] They're escaping. Go. [CONTINUES CHANTING] [OBJECT CLATTERS] [ETHAN GRUNTS] [BOTH GRUNT] Tommy, it's your dad. TOMMY: It's not. Aunty Mae, it's time to get my family back into their bodies. [WOMAN SCREAMING] [SCREAMING CONTINUES] Did it work? Tommy. Tommy, I'm so sorry I put you through this. I'm so sorry. [EMMA COUGHING] Go and see to her. I'll bring your husband back. [AUNTIE MAE HUMMING] [ETHAN GRUNTING] [AUNTIE MAE CHANTING] [EMMA SOBBING] [EMMA COUGHS] Tommy, can you make sure Lily's all right? [SNIFFLING CONTINUES] Emma? Emma, are you all right? You've been lost for so long. Ever since the last time you stayed here. [EMMA COUGHING] IZZY: You must be so tired. It's almost over. We're getting your dad into his body now. I promise. Izzy? I missed you so much. IZZY: Wait. The day I left for Marjah, what did we fight about? You said you were leaving to stop the bleeding of a country in pain. Even if it meant being apart. And you said... That their blood will taint your hands. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I left. No. No, it was me. I was just being selfish. The world needs doctors like you. Doctors that become soldiers. Doesn't matter. Just happy you came back to save us, too, Captain. - Come. - TOMMY: Daddy. You're back. You're finally back. I need to perform a cleansing. [EMMA GROWLS] [AUNTIE MAE SCREAMS] What happened to her? Kaimoni. It is a dangerous demon. Where's Lily? - Look after Tommy. - Sure. [LILY CRYING] IZZY: Emma. Please leave Lily alone. [LILY COOS] [GLASS SHATTERS] [FOOTSTEPS POUNDING ABOVE] [FOOTSTEPS STOP] Sounds like she's in her room. I'll make sure Lily stays safe. Listen. - Going to be okay? - Yes. That's not Emma. Last time I saw the Kaimoni take someone... it killed her. I killed her. No. You tried to save her. Her name was Ruby. I named her after the family of the plumeria flower. [EMMA SCREAMING] Transference will not work on a demon. A demon has never lived. I need to perform an exorcism. Emma? [EMMA GROWLS IN DEMONIC VOICE] [LAUGHS HYSTERICALLY] [CHANTS IN OTHER LANGUAGE] [SOBBING] Please make it stop. [EMMA GROWLS IN DEMONIC VOICE] [SCREAMS] - [CONTINUES CHANTING] - EMMA: Make it stop! Make it stop! [SCREAMS] [EMMA GROWLS] [GROWLS] The demon is too strong. The lagoon. We must take her there. We need to kill it. [GROWLS] [AUNTIE MAE HUMMING] Put her under. Emma! Izzy, stop! It will take her again. Take me instead. This girl, you will not hurt. - No, let me go. - No. This is my fight. Not yours. You need to stay with your family and keep them safe. That is your purpose. [PANTING] She's gone. It's too late. No. She can still come back. Izzy, Izzy... [CHANTS AND STUTTERS] I can't remember. What did she say? Just use your own words. I should've been here. I'm sorry I wasn't there. Please. Please, God, bring her back. Bring my little girl back. Don't let another innocent die. Please. [EMMA COUGHS] - Mommy? - Emma. ETHAN: Emma? Wait. What happened on your 13th birthday? I tripped and had to get a cast on my leg, but I didn't mind because I could still play the piano. And, when I took you to your first swimming class, what did you tell me? [CHUCKLES] That I'm allergic to water. [ALL LAUGH] EMMA: [SOBS] I missed you... I missed you so, so much. And Auntie Mae? How about we open that restaurant we always talked about? The one that only serves home-brewed beers? With home-cooked meals. Mom? Does this mean you'll stay? Mmm-hmm. Then this is just lovely. Best pie I've ever had. Just lovely.
