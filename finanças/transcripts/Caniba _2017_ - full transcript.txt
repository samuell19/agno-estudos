Suck it up. Slurp. Slurp. Suck up. Suck it up! A bit fell out. It's my fantasy. As painful as possible. Pain. Pain. No pain. Renée. I can't explain it. It's just my fantasy. But I can't be precise. I haven't planned out all the details. I want to be eaten by Renée. People must think I am mad. It's because I ate Renée. I know I'm crazy. I think mad. Really. Because... A calm mind and sexual desires I couldn't contain myself within that peace. I tried to make myself believe it was her body. In vain. I wish I could have been obedient. I have no Words that can digest that. Because I I killed my victim. Cannibalism is really very much nourished by fetishistic desire. The desire to lick the lips of your lover and things like that are based on primal urges. Cannibalism is just an extension of that. I want to suppress my feelings. I want to lock them up in softness. That's how I feel. That's not enough of an explanation. Well... Renoir. I like Disney. Those kind of tender things. Let me add something. In our family our parents had doggies. We were influenced by our parents. Disney, a dreamlike world, stuffed animals. We inherited these from our parents. This is all in juxtaposition with the horror. Both extremes exist within him. He is formed like that. It is the only way I can say it. Cannibalism is a totally different world for him. Isn't it? He is drawing the line. We grew up in a world like this, so I relate to it. But I can't understand cannibalism at all. Things we have in common are cute animals, the world of paintings, we think Renoir is beautiful. That's our common ground. It's too hard to eat someone who's alive, right? It would be hard because she would die when you eat her, no? I thought so. But if you just bite off a small part of meat, you could, right? But that wouldn't satisfy you? It would satisfy me. It wouldn't? It would. So it would have been enough, but you couldn't stop? No. You really thought you had to kill. If you had consulted me I could have told you that there are women in this world... Maybe there's a woman who would be happy to be eaten without dying. But it's too late now I guess. My mother wanted me to be Catholic. But not me. I have no right to be Catholic. I'm too dirt. Dirty. Mother fell down some stairs in a department store and had a miscarriage. A lot of blood and flesh came out of her. It felt like part of my own body. It was after I was born. I felt like the fetus. Mother told me about it in vivid detail. It was my torso. My heart. Well... I was scared, scared, scared of losing myself. There. I was scared. I'm scared. I'm scared I'm going to die. I'm scared of people dying. Renée died and experienced it. She must have been more scared than you. You didn't die. Do you ever think about that? Can I have some chocolate? Chocolate. What? Chocolate? You're changing the subject. "Chokotto" (a little bit)? Chocolate. Yesterday's good chocolate is all gone. We have some Meiji chocolate, but not Morinaga. Right now, you want some chocolate? It's disappointing. It was such a crucial point in the conversation. I was disappointed I didn't die. What? Disappointed? I was a bit disappointed. I thought I could die. You thought you could die. No, yes, no, yes, I still want to live. Which is it? Left foot. I don't care if he hits his head. It happens all the time. He's hit his head at least a hundred times. He'll have a MRI soon, so we'll find out. Who knows what his brain looks like now. I gave this to him to console him when he came back from France. Mr. Beaver. Let's put Mr. Beaver here. A lot of pee is coming out. I can't pee any more. I'm coming. Thank God! I'm tired. I had no idea you were doing that. I would like to see it. I don't think you want me to see it. No. Not really. When I was drawing the manga my body moved naturally. I was writing in all directions. Urge. Instinct. Pulsion. Desire. Move, move, move, move, move. Movement. The size of urge, like a wave. June 11, 1981, 3:32 pm. Holding the rifle over the shoulder. Sneaky, sneaky, sneaky. A pale face. Thud! Overflowing blood. Slither, slither, slither. Were these all your ideas? You drew the pictures? Yes. I tried to get her naked it was quite difficult. I wanted to eat her butt more than anything. Scary. Disgusting. I turned over her heavy dead body. But then... Sticking out of her crotch. A tampon! The smell is way beyond my fantasy. Whitey! Humm. White person. Blonde. The first time I was attracted to white women was when I saw Grace Kelly in "High Noon." Her profile. For a hideous person like me she was out of reach. This doesn't look like her. Probably just as well. When I first saw her her figure she was everything for me! The fantasy bred fantasy upon fantasy. Let's eat Renée! That's how it began. Finally the thing I was craving to eat was right in front of me! The stench doesn't matter! What a sexually attractive angle! I started with the richest part of her right buttock. Where the best meat was. Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! She isn't breathing any more, is she? This is after she died, right? This is so cruel. I can't stomach this any more. It's too much. I can't believe you drew someone you actually killed. You actually wanted to draw all this? I don't know. An historical moment! I can't understand you any more. I saw an illusion. This is when she was alive, isn't it? My flesh and her flesh are intermingled. I want to eat her thigh. I really can't go on with this. I feel like throwing up. I don't want to see this at all. I'm telling you, I can't stomach this. It's not fun. Comic books should be fun, don't you think? You're supposed to draw something fun. Or that would make you laugh. But you can't laugh at this. Some people must like this kind of thing. Nothing I can do about that. That's their problem. You thought this was good when you were drawing it? Not really. Then why did you draw it? They made you do it? You couldn't say no? I just had an urge to draw. So you did have an urge? I can't tell what to believe. Blood! Blood! Blood! You drew all this to keep your memory alive? Not really. No? Why then? But this is unbelievably real. I can't stand this. I'm done with this. I can't look at this any more. Seriously. This shouldn't even have been published. You're right. Right? Why did you even publish it then? It's a piece of shit. Beautiful sunset! I guess people who like this can go ahead and read it. I really hate it. I really hate dirty manga, like Nemoto-san's. Beauty, like Miyazaki and Disney's, is soothing when you look at it. Instead of comforting, this makes me want to seriously puke. That's it. Enough. No thank you. I've had it. It's finished. It's finished. It's finished. C'est fini? That's the end. I don't want to see any more. There's no reason to make this. I can't pretend I enjoyed it. Your novels like Géka are well written. But there's no reason to publish this. It's wrong for it to be out in the world. I don't see how anybody could enjoy it. It's a piece of shit. Because of this Brother's reputation will be ruined. We two really grew up like twins. We look so cute. It looks like I'm riding a tricycle. But it's really not moving. My legs weren't strong enough. I couldn't peddle. I can't stop. I get wet down there. I have to change my underpants sometimes. But I don't ejaculate. I try all different ways to find the perfect pain. This is not fun yet. I want my blood just to drip and drip and drip. My brother and I have this in common, but I wouldn't actually eat. Can I show you some video? Here I taped a firework to my arm and lit it in the bathroom. This I sent to a video company and asked if they could do it to a woman. But I was too extreme for them. But I was too extreme for them. I was upset. Sometimes I also use candles to feel good. This candle is for family altars. It's pretty hot S&M candles aren't hot enough for me. They have to be altar candles. My arm is like my sexual organ. It feels good when I rub it. So my penis is... I wonder if it pierced through. I've been doing this since I was three. I've been scarring myself like this for 60 years now. Everything is imprinted in the root of my arm. A strange, strange perversion. I'll probably die not knowing why I have it. Or if there is anyone else like me. You had no idea I was doing this to myself? You didn't react at all when I just told you? That's pretty impressive. You don't care. I don't either. You didn't feel anything? You weren't impressed? I guess you wouldn't be. Really? There you have it. That's troubling. Not really, not really. Compared to you, my condition isn't a big deal. That's true. But when I just told you, weren't you shocked at all? I guess it's not a big deal compared to you. It took me a lot of courage to tell you. I realize that. Really? It was time to tell you. I Have crazy propensity. Whatever you do, Brother, pales in comparison. But when I just told you, weren't you shocked? I guess I'm not qualified enough for you. I mean nothing to you. Uh huh. I can only live because I have you here, Brother. I can't believe I have a brother like you. After the incident I asked you, Brother, does the person you eat have to be a woman? How about a man? As your brother, could you eat me? Whenever we fight, we never totally make up. We leave it vague. We fight a lot. He broke my cello. He tried to kill me once too. If we apologized we would fight even more. You love your lunch, and eating sweets. You eat a lot. My friend told me you will live a long life. Much longer than me. I was shocked. I couldn't say a word. I want to be gone soon. It's too much work. I wonder what it would be like if I'm gone. Who's going to take care of you? I'm worried. A carer couldn't do everything I do. I'm really worried about your health, Brother. Thankfully it's just my eye, for now. Maybe we'll both live to a hundred. I don't want to live that long. Not that long, no? I want to say farewell a little earlier. So don't eat so much. Otherwise, you'll keep on living. Anything else you would like to eat? Pain au chocolat? Here you go. Maybe more chocolate around here. Would you like some water? Are you OK? Go on. You could stand up! One more step. You're a bit crooked. Are you feeling okay, Mr. Sagawa? I'm fine. Doesn't this doggie have a name? It's a cow. What? A cow? If you say it's a cow then I guess it's a cow. I'm starting to think it must be a cow. There's a doggie with a sweater on. The doggie who hates being cold. I used to wear this cute maid outfit more often. Nowadays I usually wear a more adult one. Have you ever wanted to do cosplay? You want to play a zombie? What about Dracula? That could be good. With big teeth... I should dress you as a zombie and walk you around. That would look good. I can't believe this. I'm really happy. I feel happy. It's a miracle. Can you hear me? Like a miracle. I feel there has been a miracle. Someone so beautiful, like you, taking care of me. It is nothing but a miracle. I played a zombie last year. You couldn't tell who I was. It was a sad little story. How did it go? There was a mountain. A legend says that in the mountain, you can bring the dead back to life. And a girl lost her beloved dog and she takes her dog to the legendary mountain hoping to bring it back to life. She buries the dog. But an old man turns up. She goes to the old man's home. And there is a zombie there. I am the zombie. I have to eat human flesh to survive. I'm married to the old man. The old man was saddened by my death, and he wanted to bring me back to life. But he couldn't bring me back as I was. Only as a zombie. But... for the zombie to survive, I have to keep eating live humans. I became a different creature, the old man's wife whom he loved. I'm just alive and violent. My arms and legs are always chained. So I can't go anywhere. I'm just eating flesh. Then one day I eat the girl's flesh, and my chains come off. I am suddenly free from the chains, and I kill and eat the old man. And for the first time in decades I go to the outside world. That day it was snowing for real. It was quite terrible. We had maybe a meter of snow. I come out in the snow, with my broken chains, for the first time in a while. I let out a scream in this free world. I am free and walking through the snow. Then the girl's cute doggie comes back to life as a zombie. I'm also a zombie with a sad fate. I'm alive, but I can't be with normal humans. This is a miracle.
