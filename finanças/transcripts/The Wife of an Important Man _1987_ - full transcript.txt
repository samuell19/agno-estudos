THUS SPOKE NASSER - Would you like some tea? - Yes please. What's this? - A catalog. - With pictures? - Lots of them. - Let's look at them. I love you, and I wish I could forget you, and forget my soul with you, and if it gets lost, then it shall remain yours if you ever forget me. - Did Salwa write this? - Yes. I love you, and I wish I could forget you, and forget my soul with you, and if it gets lost, then it shall remain yours if you ever forget me. And I forget you, and you show me how to forget your cruelty, but I miss the suffering you inflict on me, and my tears remind me of you, and I go back to you. And when I see you, the whole world greets me, and its desires are yours, and at that moment, all my deprivation disappears in your love. And I find you occupied, and I'm occupied by you, and my eyes alight on yours. They beseech you, but you deny me. And I watch over you, waking up at night, calling you, and I send my soul to wake you up, Get up, my oppressor, and feel my flames. THE START OF SPRING Where to, Mona? I'm going to the store. - Happy holidays. - Same to you, dear. - A blank tape, please. - 60 or 90 minutes? - 90. Make it 2 tapes. - Of course. - Thanks. - Goodbye. Who's the new face? She's the daughter of the newly transferred engineer. - I wasn't made aware of this. - Sorry, mister Hisham. - And she... - That is all I know, believe me. Come off it, old man. It seems she's a college student. I sold her some stationary the other day. - See? You have information. - What information, sir? You wily man. El Menia. Abdel Halim. The start of spring. A STRING OF VICTORIES. WE MUST PRACTICE VIGILANCE. Turn back. Good morning. Are you traveling today, sir? - Are the trains running late? - No sir. They are on time. - Coffee or tea, sir? - No thanks. Before the High Dam, this island was flooded. Now it's fertile land. Can't you stop thinking about work? My mind just drifts into it. When I got transferred to El Menia, I saw many apartments, but I could not resist ours. It's by the Nile. Waking up with the Nile by you... Sleeping by the Nile at night, it's a delight. May God allow me to enjoy it after retirement as well. How can you eat this meat? It is indeed too raw, but I'm hungry. We are so sorry. We will fix this. Good morning. Listen. - Back so early? - Listen, it's important. We need to tidy up fast. Hurry. What are you saying? I want you to wash the staircase right away. - Get some water. - What happened? A strange thing. Today at work, an intelligence officer called me. He said he wanted to talk. I invited him to my office, but he said he'll stop by my house. There's still time, Hisham. We can turn back if you've changed your mind. No, sir. My decision is final. But why this girl in particular? Sir, we have not even spoken to each other yet. It was sudden. I was struck by her bashful elegance, and I appreciated her modest upbringing. I told myself she is the one for me. I'm ready to commit. I appreciate your help. Lieutenant colonel Hisham is one of my most brilliant officers. He is impeccable, swift and bright. In the past few days, he has been conducting a private investigation about your daughter, Mona. Although he was opposed to marriage, he raised the white flag once he set eyes on Mona. He asked me to talk to you about it. The major honors me by standing by me in this important occasion. Please take your time in inquiring about Hisham. - I am confident you will decide soon. - God willing. - Let's hope for the best. - God willing. Goodbye. Thank you for coming. Goodbye. - Good morning, mister Abdel Hamid. - Hello, good morning. - Where to? - A case in Assiut. I was going to stop by later to inquire about the sugar factory. It is still under review. Stop by any time. Hello miss Mona. Would you like my seat? Thanks. Please take mine. - Do you mind? - Not at all. Excuse me. I thought this would be the best way to get your opinion. Since you're bashful, I'll go first. I took a shortcut in asking your hand from your father. I did not want to lose time. I did not want to lose my chance. I used to mock those who believed in love at first sight. I'm no teenager. I'm 34 years old. 8 years older than you. I don't think it's a big difference. It's the perfect age for marriage, the age of reason and good sense. - Would you like some tea? - No, thanks. So you can hear. Why didn't you say anything then? Please ask anything. You know a lot about me, but I know nothing of you. Then please ask me. I don't know. I have 4 siblings. 2 boys and 2 girls. They're all married, except for me. My parents live in a village. My dad owns a little piece of land. I've always wanted to be an officer. I have a picture of me in an officer's suit when I was 10. In the academy, I used to wait for the weekend to walk around in my uniform, and enjoy people admiring me. Afterward, I forgot about uniforms, and got absorbed in work. I loved it. That is why I did not think of marriage until I met you. We're almost at Assiut. You go to college. I'll go back. We're paving the road, sir. - Very good. - We aim to please, sir. - To please me? Why me? - Aren't you mister Ismail? - Yes. - We have orders to pave your road. - Orders from whom? - From the sector governor. You know best, I guess. A strange thing happened. I feel closer to you now that we spoke on the train. I feel like a teenager. I can't focus at work. I don't know what to do. - I almost went to your college. - Really? - You'd do that? - I'd do more, but... I didn't want to embarrass you, so I didn't. What could have happened since this morning? I missed you. I've never been in this situation before. I'm like a self-incriminating culprit. Careful. I don't know what to say. I really missed you. - Already? - Yes. - Can we speak somewhere? - No, I need to go. We can talk as we're walking. - People are watching. - Never mind. Impossible. You're with me, so the whole police is at your disposal. The governor too. - You're acting strange. - I must have you. I need to go. I love you. - Speak, woman. - I am speaking, sir. What about this weapon? I swear I know nothing about it. God give me strength. Speak, or else. May god have mercy on my soul... Shut up. Private. Hello. Cairo? OK. Colonel? Hello sir. Yes sir? Really? Thank god, I was worried. Thank you sir. When will it be announced? I can't thank you enough, sir. Thank you, sir. Book her. Let's go. - Congrats. - What for? - Your promotion. - You already heard? Are you tapping my phone? You go start the car. Mahmoud. Out of respect for your age, I'm letting you go. You come back tomorrow, understood? May god bless you with health, sir. Let's go. Let's not waste time. We'll pick it up tomorrow. Mona brought me good luck. I got promoted to Cairo. - Cairo? - Congratulations. We must marry soon. - Right? - How so? We need time. - Time for what? - We need to prepare... Shoukri. Drive him and come back. The Cairo apartment is ready, including its furniture. I've been collecting the best pieces of furniture for years. Whenever I came across a nice piece, I bought it. The only thing missing is Mona. You may buy bedroom furniture if you insist. What about Mona's college exams? Don't worry. Mona and I will sort that out. Won't you show me your room? I'll change the Cairo room to your liking. I'm sure you'll love it. El Mansoura. August 16.1972. - Your voice? - Yes. Abdel Halim. - Abdel El Halim? - Yes, all of them. That's what those tapes were for? Yes. - Do you always record at the start? - Well, sometimes in the middle. A great idea. How did it occur to you? Each song is linked to memories of the place where I recorded it. What's so special about the time and place of recording? Don't some people keep a diary? I record my diary on Abdel Halim tapes. Lovely curtain. It's... My late grandmother made it by hand. It was intended for my marriage, but I used it anyway. I didn't wait for marriage. Good morning. Good morning. I did not hear the alarm clock. - Good morning. - Hello. 2 specials, quick. Can't I choose my own lunch? I know what's good here. The escalope is great. What if I don't feel like it? Or should I just obey the officer's orders? The officer's at your disposal. Let's greet the colonel. - Who is this? - I'll tell you later. Colonel, sir. This is my wife, Mona. It is an honor. I am unhappy with you. With me? Three months in Cairo, - and you don't call me? - We would be honored. Mona will surely call you soon. She is lovely. You chose well. I investigated her well. - How's work? - I wanted to talk to you. - Call me tonight. - Yes sir. - Excuse us. - Please. Hello? Yes sir. It's all ready. 14 have prior files. Only 3 were unknown to us. They have been interrogated. Yes sir. 9:00 AM. Goodbye. Hi there. Why the long face? You've been silent for a while. - What is it? - What do you think? What? We agreed you won't involve me in your work. You humiliated me. Humiliated you? How? I'm unhappy with you. Why didn't you call me? She's lovely. You chose well. I investigated her well. Who is that lady? A silly woman. Why are you introducing me to silly women? - Social relations. - I am not interested. - I am. - What do you mean? Her husband is high up in the ministry. I don't care. Do it for me. You need him? Everyone needs allies to speak up for him, nominate him for a promotion. I really hate him. He's so vulgar, but he's high up. His position is excellent. A word from him could elevate me. You know... He got me the Cairo job. And? You know. He looks out for me. He's always been a loser, but he's lucky. His whole batch was moved to the countryside, except for him. He stayed here. His father-in-law fixed it for him. He used his connections. All I ask... is call her every once and a while. Be nice to her. That's how the world works. You want me to be an important man? - Good morning. - Hello. I'm your next door neighbor. Welcome. You should have stopped by my house by now. I definitely will. May I use your phone? Mine is down. Of course. Come in. - Here it is. - Merci. I need to call my mother everyday. There is a signal. Of course, your phone is never down. Excuse me. Mom? Good morning. Hello, Ibrahim. Hello, mam. I brought all you asked for. - Good. - I brought the plumber too. Hisham bey said the sink is broken. Come in. Wipe your feet and follow me. Can you fix my kitchen sink when you're done here? - It's broken. - No, he's busy. He's only here for Hisham bey. I've been looking for a plumber for a week. We must visit each other. We'll keep each other company. And my husband must meet Hisham bey. We must officially congratulate you on your wedding. Thank you. Goodbye. I want no neighbor visits. She insisted. I couldn't have refused. You must. Let's not set a precedent. Those visits are not innocent. They probably need some favor. I know their kind. I have no time for this. You must realize I have important responsibilities. You go. I have a meeting. What is it? - Are you sick? - I don't know. I'll send the doctor. Enjoy. I wish mister Hisham was here. He's got an unpredictable schedule. He was called to a meeting. Did you take your vitamins? I sent a telegraph. Your parents will be elated. The crown prince is coming - Hisham Good morning. Today's breakfast is provided by Hisham's catering services. I made it with my hands. Officer Ashraf, please eat. - He won't answer. - Who's officer Ashraf? Let your mother know when you're hungry. Don't be bashful, officer Ashraf. He's an officer already? Ashraf Hisham. It has a majestic ring to it. - He must be an officer. - Again? Officers rule the world everywhere, past, present and future. Please eat well. Our future officer must be strong. Good morning. Hello. We were hoping to meet you the other day. - I was busy at work. - Of course. We understand. The nation's security depends on you. God give you strength. Thanks. After you. - I have a favor to ask. - What is it? I own a chicken farm. I get feed from the ministry. You know how bureaucracy is. The feed distribution is very slow. I need help in expediting the distribution. All my work is legal. I just need things to go faster. Here is the information. If you could call the expert... - It will resolve everything. - I'll try. - Good morning. - What is it? Nothing, sir. Good morning, sir. - How much is it? - Don't worry about it, sir. - How much? - 2.5, wholesale price. I have top-grade bananas, worthy of a gentleman like you. - Would you like some? - I'll let you know. Fine, sir. Goodbye. Notice anything? It's delicious. Not the food. I love your dress. It's an old one. Then what is it? - Guess. - Enough already. Is this an interrogation? I can't take this now. Forget it. Forgive me. I'm exhausted. Now tell me. Nothing. - I wanted to ask about the roses. - Roses? The concierge left you this letter. His nephew is unemployed and needs help. He was too embarrassed to talk to you. But why? Am I running a charity? You're cruel. What should I tell him? He's seeking help. Let him keep seeking. That's all he's good for. President Anwar Sadat attended a joint parliament session commemorating the 5 year anniversary of the death of president Nasser. Vice president Mubarak was in attendance along with the speaker and the prime minister. The president was greeted with a storm of applause. What is it? - Next time, ask me before making plans. - Not so loud. You know I wanted to go to an Abdel Halim concert, - and you drag me to see that woman? - It's for work, dear. - Work again? - I had to see the brigadier. - What about me? - You're my love. Give me the major. Nabil? Did I wake you? Tell me... What's up with the investigation? No confession? Is he serious? Hisham. You go meet Farouk. You set up his deposition. He will testify against the arrested group. He'll say he saw them handing out pamphlets at the train station. Understood? I'll see you tomorrow. - What is it? - Help. - I'm bleeding. - Come. Your wife is fine. She can go back home tomorrow. - And the fetus? - We lost it. How long have you worked for that foreign magazine? 3 years. Has London ever influenced the topic of your articles? Never. I decide the topic. Has the London office ever interfered with your writing? Redaction, additions... Never. I... I would not stand for such interference. Cigarette? Is this an interrogation or a date? Small talk and cigarettes. What's this? - Is this a casino? - But sir... He's a prestigious and respected writer. There is nothing wrong with showing some respect. I'll take over. Sorry, I don't smoke. Tell me. - What's the dollar exchange rate? - A strange question. How is this relevant to this interview? It's quite relevant. Why else would you write for a foreign publication? I won't stand for this. - Just answer my question. - What question? - Why do you write for them? - I can't write inside Egypt. Were you ever banned from writing? You know that's not how it works. There's implicit censorship against my work. Let's assume that's true. Why would you attack your country? The land that sheltered you? I've never attacked Egypt. I criticize certain realities. You mean the government? Yes. Very well. He just confessed he's anti-government, and that he writes to incite doubt and sedition. Excuse me. Happy new year. May it be a great year for Egypt. Thank you. He owns all this. A businessman, and a congressman. That's why you got me a new dress and a new hairdo. This is the creme de la creme. Can't you appreciate the importance of my station? Happy new year, Mona. You must taste the caviar. It's all imported from Maxime, from Paris. It was flown by plane. Your work on the investigation was impressive. It's thanks to your guidance. How are you dealing with those subversive punks? They're like vermin. In universities, in factories... In the midst of poor simple people. How can you accept the things they write in their publications? They're insolent kids, dissipated, living in an illusion. We're monitoring them, sir. I've always stated that I have incriminating evidence in my possession. Watch out. Mister Mahmoud is talking politics. Is there any other subject? It is our fate, son. I'm braver than you. You attack our opponents indirectly in your articles, whereas I tell it like it is. Please, sir. Enlighten us. As I said in parliament, this country is in ruins. Indeed, in ruins. Nothing is functioning. Roads, phones, water, sewage. All these utilities must be handed to foreign investors. After all, foreigners invented the phone and the radio, and it was they who built Egypt. Strong words. Strong for you, but they come easily to me. I've always said that the public sector should be liquidated. I'll keep saying it until it is accomplished. They talk about the fate of the workers. What of them? They'll have to work hard and stop complaining. Whoever slacks off should get fired. That's true. Factories are in a state of neglect and chaos. There's more. Workers now deal with politics, as if they're qualified to do so. Everything's topsy-turvy because of their trash ideas. Take the Aswan dam, that ruined the soil and the crops. It compromised the fertility of the Nile. Previously fertile land is now barren. That's what it brought us. That dam only works in the Abdel Halim song. Nonsense. But it's not true. Excuse me? I always appreciate dissenting views. What was that? My father is an irrigation engineer. He assured me that the Aswan dam saved us from floods and droughts. If it weren't for the dam, we would not have been able to feed people. Plus it was a boon to industry. Allow me to answer. That's what schoolkids were taught to recite by rote learning. How could you embarrass me like this? Why did you put me in this position? Strange. - Why can't you understand? - Enough. Enough about your work. What about me? You'd let him humiliate me? An ignorant man mocks me in front of sycophants, and you stay silent? - Watch you tone. - You watch your behavior. I am your wife, mister officer. - Or am I? - Meaning? Meaning you must defend my dignity, instead of ignoring me. - I should defend your mistake? - Yes. - It wasn't a mistake. It was the truth. - No it wasn't. You're just making excuses. I won't stand for this. Don't stand for it if you don't want to. I'm going back to college starting tomorrow. - What's going on? - Who knows? Someone explain. They said that prosperity will reign. How are poor people supposed to live? Don't forget his razor. Where is Hisham? He's not answering my calls. He's not in the office. He's out. He's in meetings all day. The phones are busy. The army is in the street. Protests everywhere. I had to come here on foot. They set buses and tramways on fire. They looted the stores. No suitcase, please. Use a plastic bag. The police will stop me if they see the suitcase. - Stop you? - They're stopping everyone. They won't know who I am. Who is it? - Want some tea? - Sure. What is happening out there? - I don't know. - But how? Didn't Hisham tell you? We have not talked since this morning. The poor owner. It will devastate him. Ibrahim told me they torched buses and stores. Why destroy public property? Isn't it a shame? I'm so scared. I can't stay alone. You can stay at my place. We know this one. - It's not clear. - I recognize him. And this one? Don't we know him? He's implicated in the election case. The other photos are on the way. PRICE HIKES CANCELED. Yes, sir. They will be arrested soon. Can we clear it by phone? Yes sir. Yes, 44 warrants. Tonight? Yes sir. Goodbye. It's a funny play, but we're not in the mood. They want to distract people. This is boring. We should play for money. - You mean gambling? - Just for fun. Inject some suspense into it. Shall we start off with 25 cents? Sure. Based on the ministry order approved by the president, it was decided to freeze all prior orders regarding the increase in the price of goods. A curfew is enforced starting at 16:00 today and ending at 6:00 AM. The ministry of interior declared that all things are back to normal... This is the first time in my life I experience a curfew. I am scared. I feel suffocated. I was 9 in the 1956 war. We lived with my grandfather. He used to take us to the rooftop to see the searchlights looking for planes. We would sing: We shall fight, we shall fight. We'd look up and sing. In the 1967 and 1973 wars, we never went through a curfew. There was a clear enemy we were fighting, regardless of winning or losing. But now... Why worry yourself with this? Why don't we play? OK, deal. It's me. When did you come? Just now. I haven't slept in days. Couldn't you have called me? - Something happened? - No. Wake me at noon. Good morning. Is Hisham in? I'm his aunt. Remember me? We were at your wedding. Please come in. Where is he? They arrested my son. They came yesterday. They searched the house. They took him. I don't know where he is. Impossible. How could this happen when his cousin is an officer? Once they lifted the curfew, I came here from Tanta. Where is Hisham? - Sleeping. - Please wake him up. Tell him his aunt needs him. My poor son is in the last year of medical school. Why ruin his future? He is not connected to any of this. - Please calm down. - I'm losing my mind. Some say he's in Tanta prison, some say he's elsewhere. I don't know who to ask. How could Hisham allow this? I want to know where he is. I'll wake him up. May god spare you my sorrow and pain. What is it? Your aunt wants you. Your aunt, from Tanta. I want to sleep. Her son was arrested. She's crying. What can I do? Please see her. Did he mention anything? Like what? Did they find anything in his room? - Nothing. - No magazines or writings? Why are you asking me? Ask them. What writings anyway? You go back to Tanta. I'll take care of this. Go back? I want to see my son. It's procedure. They'll interrogate him, then release him. I won't move until I know where he is. Everybody boasts about your importance and influence. Why don't you call them? The son of a deputy was arrested as well. His father took care of it. He slept in his home. What son? What deputy? You're asking me? Ask them. Forgive us. Hisham has not slept in two days. I traveled all this way to get ignored by him? May god give me strength. Please come in. I'm at the neighbor's. Come in here. Where were we? Yes. We must finish all the confession statements. - Are they ready? - We're working on it. There's a lot of evidence. Publications, poems, audio recordings... How many are you? - 5. - How many? Five, working night and day. I'll send you 3 more. We must finish this as soon as possible. Sir, we did not follow the proper procedures. How so? There were excesses that were unaccounted for. Excesses? Some whose apartments were searched are abroad. They're not in Egypt. Some have been away for years. Some of the arrested were actually our own informants, on our side. It's a big operation. When you arrest 500 people... - 550. - What? - 550. - Fine. They're small mistakes. National security is paramount. But legal experts can... Come off it. - We should have revised... - We should have? We should have allowed the country to burn? Allow traitors to roam free? Do you believe that, lieutenant? - What I mean is that, in court... - Are you a judge now? We have a job to do. No time to lose. Understood? Ibrahim. You bastard. Where were you? That's Hisham. It's OK. He knows you're here. I'm going. - What are you doing? - Making tea. The boss asked me to. Based on our investigation, we have ascertained... that subversive elements activated their sabotage agents to spread anarchy, and work towards their goal of igniting a popular rebellion against the regime. - Are you going to the office? - Yes. We'll go over this tomorrow. Goodbye. You're here? Do you care where I am? You disappear for 2 days, and you don't call. Didn't it occur to you that I'd be worried? What about me? You turn the house to an office, your man is in my kitchen. What is this? Have you no consideration? Don't you care about my feelings and dignity? Play some Abdel Halim. What? Play a nice Abdel Halim song. Change into something comfortable. - It's been a while since... - Are you serious? Enough. I can't stay here. I'm going back to my parents. You want a scandal? How can I keep order in the state if I can't keep it in my house? How could that be? I don't know what happened. We fight so much. I told you not to provoke me. We both hold some of the responsibility. I really need you to be patient in these times. They are critical for my future. Either I stagnate, or I go up. Way up. And I'm not going up alone. You're coming with me. Remember? Before we got married, you said you felt I was opening many doors for us, and that people respect us, and are eager to please me. You said you loved it. That made me happy. I then knew you were the one. I was a child then. I want you to stay a child. - That's the issue. - There's no issue. I'm getting wiser by the day. My eyes now see the truth. You're under a lot of stress. You need a distraction. I know. How about college? I approve. Yes. I'll drive you there tomorrow. Don't drive me. Fine. you go on your own. - Such a fancy place. - And the best table. What's the occasion? - Celebrating student Mona. - Me? - The prettiest student. - Stop it. You sound strange. If I had known that college would restore your happiness, I would have made you go back earlier. I guess college has changed nowadays. - How so? - Because of the political events. Absolutely. Everyone talks politics. The other day, a student proposed we visit parents of arrested students. Encourage them, bring them gifts... A wonderful idea. Such a moral stance. - A student in your class? - Yes. - Mahfouz Omran? - Who? That's not his name. No, it's Majed Farid. They write poems and songs that they circulate among students. There's one particular satirical poem that's very funny. What does it say? I'll tell you later. Good morning. They arrested Majed. Impossible. When? They say you informed on him to your husband. He's not the only officer you know. Maybe someone else arrested them. Maybe they deserve it. I told you I won't live with him anymore. I'm sure you'll reconcile. What is this? She is devastated. How could you have done this? You ruined your wife's reputation. Who treats his wife this way? Listen here. I have no time for lectures. In short, your daughter is in the wrong. I didn't approve her leaving. I advise you to bring her back right now. Don't forget the circumstances we're going through. You're an old, respectable man. You retire in a few months. It would be a shame if you lost your job and got arrested. Understood? You come right now. What kind of house is this? Where are my buttons? Did they fly away? Where are they? I brought some chicken. Anything for the boss. What's going on? - Didn't you hear the news? - What news? Abdel Halim died. - What? - He died in the hospital. Lies. Lies. Lies. I am yours forever, stay mine. My eye is yours if you just stop by. You can have the other one if you ask for me. From the very first day, your love has made me sleepless. The major general wants to meet me. - Did something happen? - Nothing. Stop by when you're done. I have read your file. Your prior superiors in other towns all praise your energy and competence. However, since you came to Cairo, something went wrong. I am not talking about your output. I am talking about style and conduct. Here's the latest complaint. It's anonymous, sir. That right here is the problem. All you care about is the signature. You do not care about its contents. We must scrutinize every complaint. Even an anonymous complain might yield precious information. - I apologize. - This complaint... accuses you of resorting to cruelty and violence to extract information. Sir... I want a response. Yes, sir. Even if the complaint is anonymous, it points to a pattern. Perhaps others have not come forward. We must not allow ourselves to be seen in this light. That would compromise the public's trust in us. Go to your office and write a response immediately. Yes, sir. What? Still on hunger strike? No eating? No talking either? STAMPEDE AT THE FUNERAL. All this for a singer? Don't call him that. By the way, you remind me of my aunt. Always in mourning, crying. You never wear black. Will you wear it when I die? Or will you rejoice? I'm going to Alexandria on vacation. You're coming with me. This is the first time I'm asked to go on vacation. So it wasn't your idea? It was an order? Something odd is happening at work. Lieutenant? This is Hisham, calling from Alexandria. This morning. My wife is with me. Did anyone call you from my office? I understand. Even. Goodbye. Odd. Do you play for nuts or money with your neighbor? Sorry sir, I didn't find you in your office, and you were not answering your phone, so I came here. I disconnected the phone. I didn't want to take any calls. I'm sorry. How was Alexandria? Beautiful. I needed that vacation. It's going to be a long one. How so? It has been decided to put two people on early retirement. Me? Me too. Impossible. How? The minister informed me. That's why I sent you away. I didn't want you humiliated. The minister himself? It's not his fault. He's under a lot of public and foreign pressure regarding the affair of the arrests. We're the protectors of the homeland. It would be in ruins without us. Is that our reward? Retirement? Should we have let the criminals go? The higher court, after looking into the complaints of the arrested, freed 290 of them. The court is wrong. It ruled that there is no evidence of a plot to overthrow the state. The arrest orders were deemed illegal and void, so the case was canceled. They were released. But 167 are still being investigated, so it is not over. We did not make all this up. I've thought about this, and reached a conclusion. We're being sacrificed to pacify public opinion. So we're victims of this? I can't accept it. Be reasonable. We must follow orders. Go to your office, take your belongings, and return the keys to the office and the car. This must be temporary. They'll take us back once things calm down. They need us. I've always told him to drop this job, and accept another position. He had offers from the private sector, with a salary in hard currency, but he said no. We were born to be officers. I can't see myself doing anything else. Connect me to Berja. Yes. Hand me some change. Uncle? I need a favor. Convince my father to sell my share of the land. I need the money. I can't ask him directly. He'll say no. You know how he feels about land. I need the money right away, please. Thanks. How are the chickens treating you? I need a favor. - More trouble with feed? - No, that's fine. Let's go to the kitchen. Come with me. Let them talk. Is there a secret? - No, just business. - Business? How is Hisham involved? He'll offer him a partnership. It will pass the time, and he'll make a profit. The farm can be very lucrative with someone like him on board. But what about his job? Job? You don't know? - Didn't he tell you? - Tell me what? Impossible. Everyone knows. What do you mean? - He's retired. - Retired? How dare you speak to me like this? Forgive me, please. You think we're friends now? Never. Have you forgotten who you're speaking to? I will not allow you to speak to me like this. Get out. Never invite them again. You may not visit them. Understood? I'm sorry about yesterday. I feel awful about it. I can't believe it has come to this. I can't defend myself, my family, or my friends. I'm frightened. I feel helpless. I didn't use to be like that. God help me if it's true. It's true. How? He just drove off to work. He's not going to work. He bought an identical car, and hired a driver. It's all fake. - How do you know? - The concierge. Everyone knows. Except me? You don't want to know. Come in for tea. Come. Mister Hisham. Hello. My fiancee. - I heard you were promoted. - Yes, I was. - How are you? - I'm fine. It's a matter of days before I'm back to work. It's almost done. Excuse me. He'll never change. Thinks he's the only righteous one, and everyone else is a traitor. What is it? You have to pay extra. What do you mean extra, you thief? Why are you speaking like this? - You know who you're talking to? - No, who? You answer back? - Stand up. - You've gone too far. You're going to jail. Wait. He must be jailed. Good morning. I am an intelligence officer. I used to be. Please. I'm sorry, but 'm in a hurry. Get the warden. Back to the waiting room. Go with him. Are you here? What is it? Where's the food? What are you doing? - As you see. - Watch your tone. - What's this? - That's all we have. Where's the meat? We've been out for 2 days. I told you, but you ignored me. I expect food to be ready when I come back from work. What are you looking at? This is absurd. You know no one is delivering food. Ibrahim does not come anymore. You're not helping. I'm willing to go stand in line, but I need money. Let me know what you decide. Why are you late? I've been standing in line waiting my turn. Where's the food? Excuse me sir, but they said to tell you... - What? - You need a ration card. You're a liar. That's not true. - But sir... - You're a thief. You stole the chicken. Sir, I am not... You rascal. I'll show you. Stop it. You're making a scandal. I need to discipline him. Do they think that I'm done? I'm finished? The scum, how dare they? Drop your romantic notions. Leave him before it's too late. I had a chance to leave him and go to my parents' home after the events at college. Too late now. We're in this together. We can't leave each other. Good morning. Don't you remember me? Majdi Izz El Arab. You interrogated me. You accused me of conspiring to overthrow the state. - I don't recall. - I don't blame you. I'm not memorable. - What do you want? - Nothing. - Just a chat. - Sorry, I'm busy. Why? Did you get another job after retirement? Strange. Waiter. One coffee please. What you accused me of could have imprisoned me for years. Luckily, some official acquaintances of mine stood by my side. I always wondered. Why did you do that? For fame? Glory? A promotion maybe? What pleasure did you draw from falsely accusing people? Pleasure? I protected the state. You think your actions protected the state? Why do you believe that you're more patriotic than me or others? That's enough. - I won't stand for this. - Sure. You're not used to debate. You're too fond of your own voice. You're an extremist. Great. A brand new accusation. You never run out of them. If you were in your office, sitting in your powerful chair, you'd have set it down in ink, and woe to your victim. I served my country. I prevented anarchy. We're in a war, mister journalist. We must guard the nation against enemies. We know what the real war is. The war you talk about only exists in your mind. You invented it to sow division, confuse the ruler, and invent imaginary enemies. Thankfully, they retired you. You're a foreign agent. Let him have it. Maybe it will wake him up. On his shoulders rested the reputation of Arab music, throughout his life. Words can't do justice to his importance. My mentor, Mohammed Abdel Wahab. I need you by my side. I'm tired. Tired. Everything is crumbling around me. I'm helpless. Help me. I must go back to work. Days are passing me by, and there is still no decision. I must go back to my work, to my position. I will stand for nothing less. Nothing. Where to? Shopping for shoes. What's wrong with this pair? It's pouring outside. Go make me tea. What's this? A check from my father. How long has he been sending you money? He supports you? We're beggars now? Has it come to this? Let's not fight. Is this not my house? House? - It's a mad house. - When did this start? When? I could have humiliated you long ago. But I've been taught to stand by my husband. I withstood so many dark days. I've been so patient. But it's hopeless. I've wasted my youth and dignity. You've destroyed my well-being. And you blame me? Answer me about the money. Money? What money? You spend it all on the car and driver. Your salary is not enough for us. - You don't like my salary? - It's not that. I'm trying to tell you the truth. Enough. Shut up. You may not go out. Understood? The high court has reached a decision after examining all the facts. The events on the 18th and 19th of January were directly caused by the price hikes. The protests that erupted after the price hikes were spontaneous and were in no way preconceived or exploited... Liars. The court has found that the investigation was hasty and careless, and riven by contradictions and mistakes. Its conclusions do not stand up to scrutiny. Does that settle it? - Liars. I'll go back to work. - Again? Wake up already. - You're lying too. - I want a divorce. You're a liar. I'll show you. Open up. Call my father. Tell Mona I'm sorry. I'll take her out shopping. - Hisham... - Please tell her. I'm waiting for her. I still have influence. That house was a gambling den. - You did this? - I should have a long time ago. Father? Thank god. Please don't leave me. - Take me with you. - Sure, Calm down. Let's go. SUBTITLES BY KANAFANI
