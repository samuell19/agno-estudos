[waves crashing] [music] [plane taking off] [music] Allahu Akbar! [music playing in the background] Allahu Akbar! [music playing in the background] Allahu Akbar! Allahu Akbar! [glass shattering] [indistinct yelling] I swear to God. [indistinct yelling] Allahu Akbar! [indistinct yelling] [sirens wailing] [indistinct announcement over P.A.] [indistinct announcement over P.A.] Would you like some pretzels, sir? [baby bawling] Peanuts, pretzels? I don't know, how about you do us a favor and shut these kids up. [baby screeching] Best I can do is a stiff drink. You got people paying good money for cramped seats, overpriced drinks, and terrible customer service. Oh, we do have pure wine. As far as flying these days is no better than taking the damn bus. You know, you're right, a screaming kid on an airplane sucks. But you know what's worse? What's that? Some overgrown frat boy sitting in coach thinking his 200 dollar ticket entitles him to extra legroom, free champagne, and the right to stare at my ass every time I walk by. You want peace and quiet, slick? Next time, shell out a few bucks and get a seat up front with the big dicks. [baby bawling] Peanuts or pretzels, sir? Four write-ups, a professional standards review, and now this? Montine, do you enjoy being a flight attendant? I need the job. Then start acting like it. Your name shows up on my desk one more time, I got no choice but to ground you, permanently. [school bell rings] - Good boy! - What about breakfast? Huh! [paper rustling] - Get something at break, okay? - Okay. Good boy! Maliq! Mr. Hassan! I'm the executive director of the Ibn-Tanea School. Have you heard of it? Should I have? It's the most academically competitive Muslim school in the country. Mr. Cameroon have tested Omar IQ. Doesn't he need my permission to do this? He scored a 158. Is that good? Mr. Hassan, we are prepared to offer Omar a full scholarship to attend. Full scholarship? That's right. Shukriya. [foreign] His tuition and housing will be fully subsidized by our endowment. Oh, no, no. No, Omar does not need housing. He lives with me. Maliq! The school is in Los Angeles. I understand this would be a difficult decision. Maliq! I know you take Omar with you in the taxi, all night. Brother Maliq, this is not about me. It's not about you. It's about your son. Omar mine, it's God. The school will be a great opportunity for him. When Omar's mother was killed, I never made a bottle, never changed a diaper. But I swore to myself that I would, I would raise my own son. No matter what I had to sacrifice. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm late for work. [bustling traffic] Did you know that some dogs can find their way home from over a thousand miles away? I'm not getting a dog. If you get a dog, you could leave me at home at nights, when you drive. What, you and the puppy dog are going to fight off the robbers and the criminals by yourself? [honking] I'll get us out of the apartment, okay beta? And buy a house with a yard. So we can play soccer. I hate soccer. I'll buy a house with the the biggest laboratory, so you can do all your crazy experiments. Like that? Cab, yo! Tuck down! [foreign] [intermittent beeping] [breathes shakily] How's she doing? Just as happy as a bird with a French fry. Ain't that right, Miss Milly? I'll be in the TV room, if you need anything. [mumbling] Mom! [mumbling] What'd you say? [mumbling] Mom? Have you seen my husband? No, Mom, it's me and Montine. What did you say your name was? Montine! Montine! I like that name. [laugh] I heard you the first time. I heard you the second time. Now do not call us again. I will call you when I'm ready for you to push. I shit you not. This guy comes off the mic. As soon as he does that, we hear: "Air Asia, we are ready to push." The guy cues the mic and says, "Air Asia, I said no talkie talkie." [laughing] [somber music] [door closes] [somber music] [knocking on door] [plane taking off] [screaming] [sirens wailing] Late night, huh? What? Late night? Yeah. Yes, Pull over here. You wanted to go to Tompkins Square. [clocks gun] [intense music] [plane takes off] Careful with your money, okay? I packed you some food in case you get hungry. Why can't you come with me? Oh, no, no, no. Don't worry, beta. I will just have to finish my job, make little more money, and then I'll be in Los Angeles with you. You're gonna miss my birthday. I'll make it up to you. All right? I promise. We'll celebrate your birthday on the beach. I hate the beach. Mr. Omar! He needs to wear this on the plane. It's got your name and your dad's phone number on in here in case we need to call him, huh? He doesn't like strangers to touch him. Well, he's not getting on the plane without it. I'll put it on for him. All right. It's time to board, so. [indistinct announcement over P.A.] Oh! [gasping] I'm going to be late for work. You're going to miss your plane. Come. Come on!

We invite you to sit back, relax, and enjoy the flight. [intercom beeping] Yes, what is it? UM in 32F locked himself in the lav. Which one? [knocking] Open up! [knocking] [lock clicks] What's the mater, kid? You're scared of flying? No. So, what's your issue? I don't wanna go to LA. Locking yourself in the lav isn't gonna make this plane land anywhere different. Just make your ride a whole lot smellier. [slams door] Come on, kid. Open up! [lock clicks] He's not goin' anywhere. He'll come out when he's ready. Okay! [whooshing] [lock clicks] [door creaks] [music] [phone ringing] [music] [phone ringing] [music] [phone ringing] Hello. How is she? She had a rough night.

What are you doing still on board? I fell asleep. You fell asleep? Where? In the bathroom. You were in there the whole time? We landed with a kid in the lav. - Oh, no! - I thought you checked. You told me it was all clear. - That's what Jackie told me. - And you didn't verify? [scoffs] What are you standing there for? Come on. Let's go. [sobbing] [indistinct chatter] What happened? Why did we land? Wait here? Right here. [indistinct chatter] [indistinct announcement over P.A.] [indistinct chatter] Excuse me! [indistinct chatter on T.V.] ago in Lower Manhattan, when the first of two planes crashed into the north tower of the World Trade Center. And you can see the smoke billowing out of the towers now.

No. No planes today. No fly. That the UM from flight 189? And? I'm only responsible for the kid until we land. I want to talk to the supervisor. Look, I got a line of people to deal with. I can't babysit some kid? Just take him back to Ops! Come on, let's go. I need to get back to New York. Kid, you are not going anywhere anytime soon. The entire country has been grounded. All right? Come on! Please, I need to see my father. Let's go. Please see the information desk! Come on. [phone ringing] Can I help you? I have the UM from the- Hang on! Hang on! Larry! Larry, make sure you tell Dallas we're gonna need extra staff down here ASAP. [indistinct chatter on TV] Stand by one. What are you doing with a kid in here? Well, the gate agent told me to bring him down here. Yeah, well, I'm telling you to get him the hell out of here. - Paul, you there? -Stand by one. He is not my responsibility once we land. Listen, all UMs are supposed to stay with a crew member until we can figure out how to get them back to their parents. So find another crew member. Do you want to keep your job, Miss? What am I supposed to do with him? I don't know. Take him to a hotel, let him watch cartoons. I need that equipment count now! I know, I know. I'm doing it. All right, kid. Come on. Let's go.

In case, you didn't realize, we've got a little bit of a national emergency going on here, huh? Listen, this is no time to pull some childish prank and lock yourself in the bathroom. - Leave me alone. - Can't do that. Look, I'm on probation with my airline. You know what that means? Well, it means if I lose you, I lose my job. You don't want me to lose my job, right? Mmm? See, we're stuck together whether we like it or not. [door creaking] Kid, I swear to God, if you don't open this door, I'm going to kick it down and drag you out of there. Come on! My father has two jobs. What? He drives the taxi at night. And works at a restaurant during the day. So your dad's got two jobs? What the hell are you crying about? The restaurant he works at is at the top of the World Trade Center. [sniffling] [music] After he dropped me off at the airport he was going to work. Take me home. [sobbing] Please. [beeping] We're sorry. Your call cannot be connected. Please check the number you have dialed. The lines are still down. Just wait here. I need a car. -We're sold out. That kid over there. I've got to get him back to New York. - It's kind of an emergency. - Honestly, I got nothing. What about the other locations? Can you call and see what they have available? Ma'am, there are thousands of people stranded here this morning. I got 25 cars total. Hell, you'd be lucky to find a car in this whole state. I'm sorry. Come on kid, let's go.

Yeah, room 914. All right. 914. Copy that. The view is much better out the window, kid. [tires screeching] Next. What's good here? I don't know, burger, I guess. Make it a double. Well done. Blacker the better. Is that all? Double Stoli on the rocks? Uh! Just kidding. Whatever the kid wants. I'm not hungry. You gotta eat something. Just get him a burger and fries, I guess. I don't eat red meat. It doubles your risk of colon cancer and heart disease. Just whatever, a frickin' grilled cheese. What! You said a bad word. I did not say a bad word. Did I say a bad word? Uhh! You said order the grilled cheese. I did not say I said frickin'. That's a bad word. It's not a bad word. Trust me, there's a lot worse I coulda used. My abbu says it's a bad word. Okay, fine.

But how do you know that? I was studying the map last night after you went to sleep. Two dollars to start, and two dollars per mile, multiply by 857. Are you some kind of genius? I just like learning about lots of different stuff. All right, I understand. Looks like we're gonna have to find a car. Come on. Come on. She may not look like much, but she's got a lot of life left in her. How much? 700. That's on account of all the graffiti. You replaced these belts? Ma'am, I can assure you this vehicle's had a thorough inspection from my maintenance staff. Just because I don't have a penis doesn't mean I've never worked under a hood. Okay, I'll tell you what. I'll toss in new belts and I'll knock off 15 percent, we'll call it an even 600. 15 percent of 700 is 105. That would make it 595. [laugh] That kid's good at math.

Oh ho, so you win the best child of the year award? I'm not looking to win an award. I did it for love. Do you remember what love is? - If Michael were here-- - Yeah, but he's not. He's gone.

[music] [indistinct chattering] Quit staring at people. Sorry. Where's your mom? She left us. Two years ago. Why would she leave you? Well. When my dad was a new preacher in town, he decided to attend a little too closely to one of the sheep. You know what I mean? No. Look. My dad did some stupid things, and he got himself thrown out of the church. So we moved into my grandma's house, and he started preaching downtown to a bunch of crackheads. And my mom split and ran. Left us both. I'm sorry. Whatever. At least, I get a stupid Christmas card from Belgium over here. What? You remind me of her. - Who? - Montine. Oh gross! That bitter old lady!

What happened, is that blood? We were just at the park. And all of a sudden-- Sam! What? How could you let this happen? Well, it's not like I really had a choice. Well, you took him to the park, you were responsible for him. Yeah. And you took Uncle Mike to the building. Does that mean you're responsible for killing him? - Samantha Jean McLeod! - What? Apologize to her. No. Yes. You apologize to her right now. No! Look, ever since it happened, all she ever does is look at me with those angry eyes like it was my fault. So if you want to blame me for her blackened heart and for getting Omar beat up, then fine. Fine. Just blame me for everything. [door closes] You, okay? I don't think it was such a good idea to bully the boys. Let's get you cleaned up. [water trickling] I'm allowed to touch you when you're bleeding? No. Now here, take this and-- What are you going to do with that? Who is Uncle Mike? Michael was my husband. And you told me that he left you. He did. April 19th, 1995. He was working in the federal building. Oklahoma City I dropped him off that morning. Handed him his lunchbox. And told him I'd pick him up after work. I was running late for some stupid aerobics class and I forgot to give him a kiss. It's interesting that some of the most important moments in your life happen when you're not even looking.

You can talk to God, right? We all can talk to God. But you're a holy man. You've a special, direct connection with him. That connection hasn't exactly been working so well lately. But-- Why does God let bad things happen? [sighs] Well, some people think that God created the Earth and everything that happens after that is just chance. Others would say that things happen because of man's free will. Sometimes we make good choices, and sometimes we make bad choices. But-- I think there's some mystery to it. Because there's some things that happen in this world that we just can't fully understand. Like what happened to Montine's husband. Yeah. Like what happened to Montine's husband. [somber music] Allahu Akbar. [music] Allahu Akbar. [music] Allahu Akbar. Hey. - Let me help you. - I got it. [sighs] Hey, aunt Montine. I'm sorry about what I said to you last night.

Somebody has to. She hates me. Now, I'll tell you a secret. All 15-year-old girls hate their fathers. All big sisters can't stand their baby brothers. I'll be back on Sunday. Hey, I'm sorry again about those creeps. It's okay. It's not really your fault. [car engine revving] You know, if you tell Aunt Montine about the cigarettes, I'm gonna kick your ass. [music] [door opens] [door opens] Why you going in that apartment? It's just a kid. He's excited to see his father. His father ain't been home since Tuesday. Tuesday? He worked at the Trade Center. It's a shame, really. He seemed like a nice guy. [door closes] Okay. What's going on here? You told me you talked to him. I did. Yeah. And he said that he would be here when you got home, right? That's what he told me. So why'd that lady just say he hasn't been here since it happened, hmm? Where is he? I talked to him on the special phone. Special phone? It's right here. It's what? My Abbu taught me that we all have these invisible wires that connect us to the people that we love. [sniffling] And so whenever you wanna talk to them all we have to do is [sniffling] pick up the special phones inside our head [sniffling] it's like they're right there with us. Oh, my God! You had me believe that everything was fine. You brought me here based on some imaginary phone in your head? It's not an imaginary phone. It's real. [somber music] No, nothing. Are you sure? Ma'am, there's no Maliq Hassan who has been either positively identified-- Is there some kind of form that I could fill out so you call me when you do find him? Ma'am if he was in Trade Center when it fell, they ain't gonna find him. Sorry to be so blunt. I got eight lines holding. You see this kid? It's his father we're talking about. You got a father, right? Yeah. So just promise me you will call me if-- Write down your number. [phone ringing] [phone ringing] [phone ringing] What's this? Take the kid to the child services office. I'm sure they can help you. Let's go. How do you spell his name? O-M-- No, no. I got the Omar part. His last name. Hassan. H-A-S-S-A-N. Okay. How old are you? Ten. Any other family? No. Any aunts, uncles? Grandparents? I think I have an uncle back in Pakistan. I don't understand why I can't stay with you? Now, kid, I live in a crash pad. What's a crash pad? Well, it's an apartment with like ten bunk beds scattered all over the living rooms and bedrooms. You... You live with that many people? No, the international girls just usually sleep all day because they work the red eyes. Domestic girls come stumbling in after they bars all closed. And first come, first serve. So the beds are full, you gotta just curl up on that dirty old couch or toss a blanket on the floor. It's not exactly home sweet home. Why don't you get your own place? I don't want my own place. I-- It's too quiet. You know, sometimes on my days off, I go to the airport and just get on whatever flight is taking off next. I spend the night in the hotel and flight back the next morning. Why? Because as long as I'm-- on that plane or at the airport or hotel, I've a purpose. You know, a reason to get up in the morning. If there's anything of his you want, you might wanna pack it up now. [phone ringing] [phone ringing] Hello. You wanna tell me where you are? I'm, I'm sorry. What? Where are you? Who is this? This is Paul Ehrlich with Ops in Longview. Shit! Yeah. Shit's right. I ring the hotel. I ask them to give me room 914, what do you think they tell me? I don't know. There is no room 914. So where the hell are you? [phone ringing] So you made the unilateral decision to drive the unaccompanied minor back to New York? Actually, we started out on a bus, but we got kicked off. And then, I made the unilateral decision to drive. You may think that this is amusing, but I can assure you I don't. You violated almost every rule we have regarding the care of unaccompanied minors. Yeah, well, the rule book kinda got tossed out the window Tuesday morning. Perhaps by you, but we still have an airline to ride. Yeah. And I had a small child who was all alone and-- With legal obligations to adhere to and consequences if we don't. Do you have any idea what could have happened if he got lost? Or if he had an accident? The lawsuits that we'd be liable for? Lawsuits? Is that what this is about? Who's gonna sue you? This meeting is over. Mr. Al Katani will take Omar from here. Oh, really? Who are you afraid is gonna sue you? I mean, his only family member is probably buried under a billion tons of steel and concrete. What about Omar? Termination paperwork. And I'll need to get your ID. Probably he'll end up in foster care. He's not going to a foster home. He's staying with Mr. Al Katani tonight. And then, he's booked on a flight to LA tomorrow morning. Oh, why? There's some school there. That's what his father wanted for him. That's where he belongs now. We like to thank you for all what you've done with Omar. And we ask God to bless you with happiness, health, and a state of mind. Say good bye. Have some time with him. So you gonna be a good kid? I bought a little surprise in here for you. But don't open up till you're alone. I don't want you to get in trouble with the big man. Thank you. For everything. Omar Habibi time to go. Say salam. Salam. [door opens] [music] [foreign] [foreign] How can we apply this to our situation now? When the Prophet Muhammad's son died, he said that eye shed tears, and that the heart is grieved. But we will not say anything except which please our Lord. Masha'Allah! Masha'Allah! Omar, you have a wonderful heart. Follow it. Will take you to the right path. Good night Omar. [door closes] [lock clicks] [unlocks zipper] [sound] ♪ Playing Lay Me ♪ ♪ Down by Damon Aaron ♪ [♪♪♪] [phone ringing] [phone ringing] Yes. Hello. Thank you very much for coming. Omar said he wouldn't go to the airport without you? He locked himself in the bathroom. He's got a thing for bathrooms. [knocking on door] Hey kid, open up. [lock clicks] We gotta quit meeting like this. What's the matter? Tried to call my Abbu on the special phone this morning. He didn't answer. This early? Probably he's still asleep then. Look kid, here's the deal. Losing things, losing people that you love, it hurts. There's gonna be days when you think you can't possibly stand how much it hurts. Honestly. You'll feel like your heart's gonna explode from the pain. Then you wake up the next morning and you open the blinds and you just keep going. For a while, you're just living in that space between. Between what? Between the last time when you saw him and the moment you can finally say goodbye. After a few years, you'll crawl into bed one night and realize you don't even think about him at all of that day. But then, every once in a while, he'll come to you in your dreams at night. And the warm thought of him will wake you in the morning. Will you walk me on to the plane? [music] And for that little tiny sliver of the moment, he's right there by your side again. And nothing... No other person, no distance or time can take him away from you. [somber music] [closing score] [closing score]
