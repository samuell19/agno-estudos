Once upon a time, once indeed, as if it wasn't once there wouldn't be any story and with no stories good wouldn't defeat evil. Even though this story shows that there's no evil without good and no good without evil in every single one of us. Anyway, there were two kingdoms for sure. The Rose Kingdom and the Lily Kingdom, both that small that nobody knows about them anymore. And these kingdoms were within a hailing distance. Let's begin with the Rose Kingdom. People there were not doing really well maybe because instead of a king and a queen the royal advisor and ambassador Theofil ruled there. My precious stones. There, we need to have some rest. It's time to go to bed. Hey, where are you going? - Matthew, I almost peed myself! - Did you? So where did you go? Nowhere I'm just walking around strolling. Just taking a walk as usual. Oh, I 'see. Man, I thought that you were about to rob someone. So what, I'm hungry. We haven't eaten for a week. Matthew, I know about a window and it's usually open. There's so much food behind that window, that we could feed the whole village. And who lives behind that window If I may ask? A man called... Theofil. What a name, Theofil Are you crazy? Theofil is the royal emissary. Is that a kind of bread? Special envoy of His Majesty The King. You aim pretty high. That spells a huge a trouble. What's going on there? - Huh? - What shall we... - Good evening! - Evening. What are you two doing here? - Well...nothing.. just strolling. - Yea? - What do you mean strolling? - Strolling. Like that ... - Wow, look at that. You have to see this. - What? What a lovely stars today? It's the best when the spring comes to the Rose Kingdom. - You can smell the flowers in the air. - Right. True. Women take off ... ...their coats. Where's the other guy? He has already hit the sack. - Hit the sack? - I hope so. - Oh man, look at these muscles. - What? Yea. You must be a strong man, right? - I always admired ... - What? - That you're not scared guarding at night. Alone. - Right? - Now I do understand. - Right. It's true that I'm quite vigorous. See. But to be honest. - Nothing ever happens round here at night. - Ah OK. - Well, I guess I should go, too. - Why would you? Backgammon - do you want to play? - Well. - What?! - Yea. And I'll introduce you to the commander of the castle. Come! Abi of peas. why OK,. What? Who? Damn. Stop or I'll shoot! Alert! Catch the thief! Someone has stolen my money! My money! Come on! Move! Money! Drum properly! My barrel is leaky! Guys, guys! Let's sing a song, huh? I like girls with blue eyes, girls who are nice, girls who play dice. I like girls with blue eyes, girls who are nice. Alert! Move! Move! Move! Look at the juniper look at it properly... He has stolen my money! Thief I Catch the thief! Chubby girl, chubby girl, you are the best in world. - I need to go to the loo. - Go! Upside-down Kingdom Have you caught him? Have you? There you are! So we got him. I got him. A thief? A thief! Give it to me. Give it to me! Where is it? Pears, apples, where is it? That's it? Halberds closer! Here you go. Halberds further. I knew it. Come to daddy my darling, my precious. He's with him. - Arrest him, too! - No, not me. - Get them both to the dungeon. - I don't know him. Not me, really, I don't know him. I'll make sure you get what you deserve. Between the Rose and the Lily Kingdom there was a land route around the Black Forest and that was a place which was better to avoid. And that was a place which was better to avoid. There was a rumour that the Black Forest was haunted. And your life was in danger there, as scary forest creatures lived there. Let's go! - This is awesome. - So much fun. - Awesome. - Awesome. Awesome. Shush, shush. What was that? Can you hear it? - A woodpecker? - No way it's a woodpecker. - What is a noway woodpecker? - What's he saying? Stench. - Stench. Stench. Stench. - Yuck, ick, icky, yuck! Pucks, you're crazy, The Mistress of the forest is calling us. Come! - Go, go. - Scoot, scoot, scoot! Come on, run. Hey, Leshy, leave! Get out, this is only for intelligent creatures! Oh, for intelligent creatures? Then what is Troll doing here? - Who knows. - Yuck. Look, it's happening. My dear friends, can you hear the sound? The lumberjack who we graciously permitted to build up his cottage near the Black Forest, has breached the agreement and is cutting down the trees in our territory Shame! An attack against the sacred trees of our forest is an attack against us. We must punish his impudence strictly. - What do you suggest? - We will dance him to his death. Mistress leave him for us. It's our job. Nymphs again. - It's always the nymphs. - We will take care of him! Creatures of the forest, hold on! Our rules say to haunt not to meddle in human world. You are wise Mr Gnome, but in this case haunting is not enough, we have to protect our territory But not by force! Right. I agree. Eithne, fly fast, and find one boobygoof and one clumsylear. - Yea, yea, I know these boobygoof and clumsyleaf. - Quickly We'll make the lumberjack such a potion, which will steal the most important things he needs for his living. Yes! Sorry. Few leaves of boobygof, and one whole clumsyleaf, we'll throw it to the spring he drinks from and he won't cut down a tree ever again. Boobygoof, clumsyleaf, boobygoof, clumsyleaf, boobygoof, dumsyleaf... - It's impossible to escape from here. - Shut up! Or... Unless you have an ace in the hole of your sole! Blech. Surprised, aren't you?! Hmm...crikey. So, how's it going? Well, very well. Why wouldn't it go well? Let's say two meters of wall ... multiply by ... Well, if it goes like this we will be out in 30 years. That's it. I am innocent! Innocent! You always get us into trouble! Matthew you're lie my brother we can achieve anything together. You like me, don't you? So what? You were hungry too, weren't you? Don't make me angry! You shouldn't have gone there in the first place! I told you what kind of man Theofil is. And anyway, didn't you go there only to get some food? So why the coin? Matthew? There's a lot of straw here! I know how to get out of here. Boobygoof, clumsyleaf, I've got it, I've got it, boobygoof, clumsyleaf boobygoof, clumsyleaf I've got it, I've got it. Nice, okay, sooner or later he'll get thirsty. Add this. And let's not forget about this. Clumsyleaf, there. - Here he comes. - I am deaf not blind. Let's go. Hello Tree. Hello. Oh, look, look. What's he saying? What a dummy. He's done with cutting, he won't be able to cut even a bonfire stick. Wow, this is one big tunnel. The guards are pretty dumb, right? - Long, isn't it? - lt is. Most importantly it leads out. A few minutes and we are free. - I got you. What Is it? - What does it mean? Get up you bloody thief. - What's this, you...? - Look. What is it? What? What are you doing you bastard? - Let us go. Immediately. - Let us go. - Let's go. - Come on, help me! - Help! - It's your fault, you're stupid. That's not fair. - You know I'm afraid of heights. - Hold the rope and climb. Okay Alert! Alert! Alert! - Where should we go now? - Faraway from here. Let's get out of the Rose Kingdom, there's no bright rose future for us here. Let's go to the south. To the Lily Kingdom. What an idea. I've heard people are doing much better there so maybe they're even clever. I don't want lilies! Clever people. The neighbouring Lily Kingdom was thriving ruled by a kind-hearted king and a wise queen. But even here not everything was that bright. - Guards! Take these ... - What happened? It happens sometimes, that parents who are very successful have a daughter who gets everything she wants. What happened? And that can never be good. - Calm down, sweetheart, please. - Who has put these stinky lilies here? With all respect I daresay it was - our new gardener. - So it was him! The gardener! - Bring him here so I can see him. - I will. Margaret, please, stop it Oh, leave her, my beloved sweetheart. What's wrong, my dear? You know I hate lilies. - We do know. - So what are they doing here? - We don't know. - I can't breathe. - Come here, sweetheart, there. Where's everyone?! - I can't breathe. Come on, come here! Get those stinky lilies out of here or she will lose her breath. Right? That's him. It's you? You, you, you! Do you know how prison looks like? - I do not. - See, one should get to know everything, So you will know now. Arrest him! - But that's not, well .. - Dad? - Arrest him. Of course, arrest him! - Did you hear me? - Arrest! - But, what...what... what...what...what are you doing, what are you doing, help! Come here, my precious, my beloved darling. It's okay, it's okay now, now we'll get dressed and we'll be nice to our guests. Such a bad day. Such a bad day. - Dad?! - The princes have come to woo and they will all propose. How could this happen to me? Look, what you've done. - Bad boy. - Damn, you scared me! Damn! Oh wow, The Mistress. - Good afternoon. - You've made a terrible mistake, lumberjack. Why did you cut down the trees in our forest? - Didn't we have an agreement? - We did. We did have an agreement You knew I wouldn't leave it like that, didn't you? It doesn't work that way Ah, so because of you, I'm such a useless butterfingers. Don't raise your voice at me, human, you know the agreement, the forest to the left of your cottage is yours the one to the right is ours. Why would you cut down our sacred trees? Why? I'm sorry. I'm really sorry Your Mistress, it was our princess she was passing by riding her horse, saw your beautiful beeches and decided she must have new larger and more beautiful bed. I had to do it. Under the threat of punishment. Accept my apology. I see, Princess Margaret. Now I know which way the wind blows. Well alright, I'll give you your skills back. Come. Here, take . Thank you. Thank you. Thanks a million! - But what is it? - Rethorn, a magic herb if you put it in your spring and then drink some water from it, you'll gain your skills back. Rethorn! Thank you, thank you, thank you! It seemed everything ended up well. The lumberjack learned his lesson. The wise Gnome was probably wrong when he said no to meddle in human world. But you don't need too much to get in a huge trouble. On the same day the old herbalist's spring has dried up after a long drought So she went to get some water from the spring in the forest. Come here girl. At the moment even the Mistress of the forest couldn't know, where would her poisonous water get to. There, thank you, Mary Oh look, I's boiling, hmm, well I must add some water from the spring. Nettles like that, feverfew there. So it's easy to get rid of flu. Chamomile there. Like that A little bit of datura and henbane, to avoid the sadness and all the pain. And as the last one the most important a mandrake. There we go. The potion So no-one's ill. Oh well, I wish the herbalist had known That instead of a healing potion she made a potion, which turns anyone in a dummy and a butterfingers. - What's that? - It's a present from The Duke of Brandenburg. It's a new plant from overseas. - And is it edible? - lt is. I'm pretty sure people here won't like these pomtytoes. Next time they can stick their gifts up... ..up there. Set me free! Set me free, I didn't do anything! Let me go I didn't do anything. What did I do? Tell me what I did. Can you hear me, I didn't do anything. Stop yelling! You give us a headache. Gardener, you're new here, aren't you? - Yes, please. - Great. And what else can you do? Besides gardening. Your Majesty, I can also cook. And poa... game hunt. You can cook? That's nice. Call the third cook. Afternoon, what's going on? Watt. Gardener, I'm appointing you third cook. - Right? - Great. And you cook, I'm appointing gardener. - Again? - Thank you, thank you! I've already been a gardener twice. I hope princess doesn't remember me. He's right, what if she remembers him? No worries. What?! You haven't found them?! You're the commander of the castle. Oh my, oh my I will .. ...kill you! You! You're useless. Useless! Useless! You let them escape? Fired, fired, you're tall. Guys, we need to find them. We need to catch them. No-one can know that somebody escaped from our prison. Attention! Higher attention! Your commander guys, is Useless dummy. Idiot! Stand at ease! More at ease! Attention! Higher attention! Stand at ease! More at ease! Even more at ease! Look out for me! Human words, human words are such a pleasure for our souls. Look, for example goulash or a lumbago. - Gee! - Well yea, that’s a nice word, too. Hey listen, let’s go to the forest before someone spots us. Come. Let's go! - It looks quiet, - Yea. Yea, completely deserted. - Let's get out of here. - No, no, no, wait a second. Can you see his coat of arms? Outlanders! - Maybe they have something to eat. - Forget it, Jacob! Matthew, Matthew, please for the last time, the very last time just a teeny tiny robbery. What? To have something to start with. It's not that easy to get out of this kingdom. Okay, I screwed up. How could I know they'd be that furious about one stupid coin. Do you think I wanted to be - Caught and arrested? - No. I'm mad you dragged me into it And that you never tell the whole truth. We agreed we don't steal. Time to time we nick something to eat, but that's it, no coins. Oh no, that branch gave me a very ugly thorn jab. - Shall I beat it up Your Highness? - Maybe later. Ouch, such a terrible pain. Gt out of our way! - They must be following us. - You shut up, leave it on me. But Albert, why are you so rude? Didn't we talk about? We agreed we'll be nice - to s... ? - St... - We'll be nice to stra... - Stran...? - To strangers, right? - We did Your Highness. - And especially to way...? - To wayfa...? Don't tell me you don't remember it. Especially to wayfarers. - You're right Your Highness. - See. - Your Highness? - Yes? I don't like these two at all. Who are you? - Highborn lords. - Excuse Us. - We've been robbed, they've stolen everything from us. - Everything. - Gt out of our way! - Albert, enough of that, and take me down. I have to succumb to the call of nature. And from all the riding I have really painful... - Are you alright Your Highness? - Ouch! My ankle... it feels sprained.. - Your ankle, that's bad. - I can't wait to get to the royal court. You know, all the sumptuous food and a decent bed. Here you are a few coppers and now, get out of here you scum. - Scum? - Here you go, scum, that's a nice word, too. And who should we be grateful to, Your Highness? I am the Knight Albert from Buckshire and this is my provider the Prince Jerry from the Amber Kingdom. The famous fighter? I've heard he hasn't lost any of his last five jousts. Him? - Everyone is talking about him. - Noo! - What? - Well, yes, yes, he's a hero, isn't he? And how do you know who's really fighting, huh? In this armor. In this helmet. It's a beautiful helmet indeed, could you tum around, sir so I can see that lovely plume? Well, why not, have a look. - I'll show you who is scum, you sod. - What? This springtime, those colours. I only wish my back didn't hurt. Excuse me. But Albert, you can't take a nap in the middle of the road, come on, get up, let's go. - Where's my horse? - Over there, sir. - Oh, thank you. - Your Highness? - Yes? - May I? - Don't stare at me, help me to tie him up. - Jacob! Let him go! Are you crazy? We said this would be the last job -and from then on, only an honest life. - No, you said that, -that's exactly what I was talking about. - What about? We will have horses and clothes. Right, I said that you'd gone to far when you stole -the coin and now you want to rob aristocrats. - I'm a prince! - Can we talk about it after we're done? - Done with what? Prince Jerry, may I have your attention please? I want you to know that I absolutely disagree with this way of making a living. No, no, no, I'd like to help you. Help me?

To make sure that not a single mouse will sneak in. That's what I'm saying. That's what I'm saying. What are you doing here? Nice to meet you, too Your Highness, I'm Matthew:. There we go, our noble arms got flaccid, let's do it properly, shall we? And our noble legs got flaccid, too. Time to go for a ride, what do you think ? - Aren't you hungry? - Don't you want some dried fruit? Or an earthworm? Where am I?? Who are you? Goblins? Careful, we're not goblins! We are Pucks and we're taking care of you. What am I doing here? You'll pay for this. - Want to go home! - Don't be silly! You are our prisoner! You think? Ridiculous. You are a prisoner of the Black Forest Society. And if you want to eat, you have to work. Work? Forget it! Oh well, no pain no gain. Come. Full moon Is coming, There's a fairies' event happening. You see the lake? That's where the fairies love to dance, and the lake needs to be clean as mirror. You'll rake all the leaves around, so the wind doesn't blow them to the lake. All of these? Never! - I won't! I won't! I won't! - You will! You will! You will! And Leshy will make sure you don't run away. Well but Leshy is a herbivore. - True. - He eats only grass and roots. - He would never hurt her. - But she doesn't know that, does she? There's not a single person without any good or any evil, Neither there's a person who wouldn't deserve a chance to become a better person. Even though this change can be kind of painful. There wasn't much good in Princess Margaret, but the Mistress had decided to give her a lesson with help of the forest creatures. In her own way. What? You can live with us. It's warm in the huts. I want to go home, you'll pay for this when I get out of here! We have our pets in the garden, take them for a walk to the stream. What? No way. No way am I taking your beasts somewhere to the water. Forget it - I’m leaving! I'm going home. - Hey! I told you to take the pets for a walk. Alright, I'm going, I'm going. Is anyone here? Is there anybody in there? Is there anyone? Wake up! Have you seen them? - Have you seen those two? - Why? Did they do anything? Do you recognize them? - No. - Don't ask then, - yokel. - Okay If you're lying, you'll hang on a gibbet upside down. Are you tired? Thank you for your help. Oh, Its you. What do you want? Leave me alone. Leshy likes raspberries but he's not able to pluck them. Leshy, show her your claws. He wants you to share them with him. Noway. Get out of here! Can you hear me? Leave! I's not enough even for myself. True, you are right. Shut up, rabble! Shut up, rabble! The envoy of the Rose Kingdom is coming. Where's your innkeeper? Bumpkins! - What's up? - This is how you welcome your guests? Noble strange men, how can I help you? We're looking for two criminals, tall, light hair, terrible looks, robbers. - Has anybody seen them? - May I? - No. - Haven't you seen them? Oh, I see, international investigation. High importance! Would you like to have something to eat to refresh yourselves - before you leave? - Well, if you insist. Great, my pleasure, sir. You girl, on the table! Innkeeper is paying for us! Pork, beef. - Some fish, sir? - Bring some fish. And beer and wines and some quiche, so it rhymes. Very nice poem, Sir. You're not able to dance on the table! You're not able to dance on the table. Open the door! Can you hear me? Let me in! Can you hear me! Could I sleep over? Please. - Very well, - Yes, well done. I do understand you, my friend, it must be very unpleasant when someone escapes from your prison. Even though it's that secured it's impossible. But we can't help you. Your Majesty, if you would deign... Well, I would deign but there's no one else who would deign with me. You can't be serious. Oh, I am serious. Catch me, catch me. You will never catch me. Unfortunately, as you can see everyone in my kingdom has gone crazy. We've been cursed. And on top of that our beloved daughter Margaret is missing, she's being looked for, by the last sane people here. So no, we don't, we don't, we don't we don't have a single man who could go and help you to find those criminals. Give me a horse, I want a horse. Where's my horse? Quick, cook a horse for me! I think, I get it. The only thing I know, that our guards saw them - entering the Black Forest. - The Black Forest? - Yea. - You should have said that earlier, Your Majesty. So you don't have to be looking for them anymore, No one has ever left the Black Forest alive. - You think? - Yea. What? How... How dare you? I'm a princess. Nool! - You're so clumsy, a clumsy butterfingers. - Leave! It's too easy to fly with wings. - Who are you? - You should know, - Whose trees you cut - What? Oh yes, you're the Mistress of the Forest Yes. Could you do the Pucks a favour and clean the mud and reeks from the lake, please? Yes. Yes. They say the picture is not what it used to be. Is it cold? No. Not at all. Be careful, it's water creatures' home. Don't startle them. Look, - look what she's found? - Well, a helmet? - How did this get here? - Some thieves left it here. They were fleeing through our forest It was ages ago. My mum used to tell me a story about twelve thieves who would mug wayfarers or steal wealthy people's kids and then requested ransom money. I think there were twelve of them. Once they even kidnapped a prince from the Rose Kingdom. They got the money but - nobody has ever seen the boy again. - know this sad story. When I was a little girl they used to scare me saying that if I was naughty the thieves would come and kidnap me. And? They didn't. And what happened to them? Bad people can't get out of here alive. Well, well, what are you doing here? You are...? You are...? Wow, you are. I am but what are you two doing? She's better isn't she? - Isn't it time to let her go? - When the time comes I'll set her free - with pleasure, but not yet. - Don't you think it's time for us to leave? Where should we go? Both of the kingdoms are looking for us. - I know they are. - We should wait until everything - calms down and then head out. - Before you decide, Matthew, could you please give this dress to Margaret, so she doesn't have to wear that nightgown all the time? And what about me? Me? Why me? - Why not him? - You humans, always asking why, why, why. - She didn't answer. - But that ,why, why"... I almost forgot. I owe you that - pot full of gold. - Keep it, we don't want it. Matthew! - Well, I'd take a few of those ... - Too late. - Smile a bit - You? - How dare you to talk to me? - Walt! - Don't be mad at me. - What do you want? I've brought you this dress. Wow. - Turn around! - [ know this trick. - Turn around! - [ know this trick. I turn around and you'll hit me in the head with a stick. I'm not surprised you think that. But I'm not a thief and a robber like you. I don't hit people in the head. - I just want to change. - Sorry. Well, you're right I haven't always live an honest life, but couldn't we forget about it? - You'd be surprised, but we have a lot in common. - Sure. You're a man, I'm a woman. You're poor, I'm rich. - You're a thief, I'm a princess. - Who did you say you are? I said I'm a princess. You steal, I don't. Real twins, like two peas in a pod. The clothes of Prince Jerry you're wearing don't make you a noble man. - You, who dressed to look poor, are saying that. - What are you talking about? - Neither of us lived a good life. - I'd been happy before you kidnapped me. I talked to people from your Kingdom. - Do you think they like you there? - You're a liar! That's not true, everyone likes me! Yea, even though you're spying on people? You bluster and think the whole world will spin in the pace you want You may get what you want, but people will never like you. Even though you're a princess. Wow. Thank you. May I? Is it true that no one likes me? - Nobody? - have to go. I'm sorry but remember you get what you give. You get what you give. Ridiculous. Can I help you with anything? The whole kingdom is a mess. Everything is going wrong. My wife has gone crazy Margaret has been missing for a month. I'm not, dear envoy, I'm not in a good mood. Your Majesty, I understand you more than you think. - I've lost all of my men. - Oh, well. Two burly halberdiers, gone. And still no thieves. Damn it, I can't go back to the Rose Kingdom without them. I have to catch them. Dead or alive At least one of them alive, the second one can be dead or the second one alive and the first one dead. - Do you get it? - No, no, No, No, No, NO, NO NO. When Prince William was a toddler, you know, a baby;, thieves ambushed the royal coach and kidnapped him. That's why our king hates thieves and we punish even the smallest thefts harshly - Oh yea, oh yea. - Well, I don't have kids, fortunately. But I'm sure it's terrible when someone kidnaps your heir to the throne. Well I don't have a throne, unfortunately, fortunately Of course, we know this sad story. But it's not easy for any of us these days. Let me show you something. Well. Its a bit sparse. Well, it's not a nice view. Your Majesty, don't sob don't sob, Your Majesty. Do you feel sad because your kingdom is suffering that much? I wasn't thinking about that. I miss my parents. Margaret, I think it's time for you to go home. Really? Thank you! - Thanks a lot. - Oh, come on. - Good luck. - Thank you. Come here! Don't cry or I'll start to cry, too. - Come on. - I'm not crying. Watt, wait! So you don't forget. Thank you. And don't be that sad, smile. Good one. Gentlemen, I'm telling you in privacy that their kingdom is about to fail. Total bankruptcy And I wanted to marry that kidnapped dummy; - fight Albert? - Dummy sure, Your Highness. Princess is back, Princess is at home! Where's everyone, come here! - Our princess has saved us. - Long live the Princess! - Hurray! - The Princess is back. - I can make shoes again. - My pies are not burnt anymore, Princess. - Long live the Princess! - It's her, Margaret, it's Margaret.. My Margaret. - Margaret! - Daddy! Oh, shut up. So you've come back to me? - And where is mum? - Poor girl, your mum has gone crazy. She's all over the place and it's hard to find her. - Give her this, it'll help her. - And what is it? It's a gift from the Mistress of the Forest, who drinks it will gain the skills back. Well, we'll see, we'll see. Nine nice night nurses nursing nicely. Nine nice night nurses nursing nicely. Give this to the Queen when you find her. It's them! Those are the men who mugged us! Thieves! - Bandits, Albert! - Guards! Damn, I'll tear them to pieces! Dad, do something. Dad, do something. - They've saved my life. - But Margaret there's nothing I can do here. They might be international criminals. I know, but there must be something we can do. That's it! And silence! - Please, don't. How shall I know - what I should do now? Huh? - Execute. - What? - Yea, execute. However we need to investigate this situation properly And because they're on our territory we will follow the You know what, the common sense. Put them in dungeon, for now, - go! - Scoot, you ... Thank you, daddy - Wait, wait, don't push them. - Push them harder! - In-our kingdom they would be sentenced to death. - The same in ours. - Don't push. - Did you hear it? It's imp, it's...it's impossible, she, she can't be our daughter - Ours? - No, ours! She didn't scream, she said thanks and she wants to help people. Long live the Princess! Long live the Princess! - Blueberry. - Not a blueberry blueberry is the fourth from the left. This is? Pear! Oh my god, oh my god, I've eaten all of their marmalade, - They could send me to jail. - Jacob, you are in jail already. Yea? - Leave us alone. - I can't do that. Please. Only for a minute. - Hello. - Hello. Aren't you cold here? So what, So what, So what, so what, So what, how are we doing? I have some good news and some bad news. The good news is that you won't be executed. No execution! And the bad news? They will cut your am off. Cut my arm off? What do you mean cut? How will they do it, mine sticks together firmly. My little arm. Bring the prisoners! Some celebration, I guess. Matthew, Matthew, look, look. Hello. Helloo. - Are you alright? - Yea, I'm just trying how it will be without an arm. It's okay now, but what when I grow old. - Jacob, Jacob, come here, - Matthew It's going to be fine, don't sob, shh, it's going to be fine. Mate, you look almost like an octopus, have they cut your tentacles off, too? Good people, good people, you can't be serious, you can't do that to us. Come on, people, don't tare, do something. - Matthew please help me. - Somebody do something. Margaret, do something please. Margaret, do something Look at the birthmark. Can you see that boy? That boy has the birthmark. The birthmark! Hold on! Wait a minute! Stop it! Get out of my way! Stop the cutting! Wait! You, where are you from? I'm from nowhere, well, I'm not sure, they've found me in the forest. - Have you got parents? - No. - I've got only him. - We grew up together in the forest Get up! No, stay as you are. Down! Stay as you are! The birthmark is real. What's he doing? What's he doing? I'm terribly sorry William. This is the lost Prince William, Heir to the throne of the Rose Kingdom, son of our king. I have to ask you to cancel the sentence. Silence, silence. Well alright then, let him go if you want, but we can continue with the other one, can't we? Right, so, do it, cut. Not No way, no way. Either both of us or none of us! - Dad, dad - Daddy what is it, why the bells? Our Princess Margaret is marrying Prince William. - Who is it? - It's Matthew. - Ah. - I want to be a bride, too, Quick, run away! Princess Margaret and Prince William! Hurray! It been said many times, that love can overcome anything, and its more powerful than any kind of magic. What are you doing here, come with us. And how beautiful the world would be if everyone was that lucky to have love. But what about Jacob? I'm sorry mate, but I have to go. I know. Go. Say hi from us Its a nice wedding, guys. - Get out of here, you beast! - It's our food! - Go, go, go! - Leave! - I'm giving it back, - I know, - you get what you give. - That's what I'm saying. Oh well. We've done! Good job. Good job. But wasn't it you who said not to meddle in human world? I admit, even I can have a weak moment. Once in thousand years Look, look, I've brought you something. No, no, no, not like that. Look. Here, try it. Smells nice! This one's my favourite. I know this.
