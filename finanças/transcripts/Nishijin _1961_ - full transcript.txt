A city drenched in the rain of old memories. Beautiful kimonos don't always come from beautiful places. Dark rooftops, the weight of tradition. Underneath, if fabric flower bloomed, it wouldn't be strange. Kyoto, Nishijin. Flowers of fabric, rain of thread, rain of silk. It's not for you that this rain falls. The kimono has long been adored. These days, young girls like western clothes. But take a step back. It's kimonos they really want; they're every woman's dream. Here, that dream is made for others. Business is separate from dreams. Don't disrupt the tranquility of the loom. According to myth, when her loom was defiled, Goddess Amaterasu hid herself in a cave. We find the same moral in the tale of Yuzuru. The farmer's wife, a crane, wove cloth from her own feathers. When seen weaving in her true form, she fled the human world forever. “Weavers Wanted: Good Pay, Fair Treatment" “Now Hiring Weavers” This is an old story. An army battled on the East and West banks of the Horikawa River. All that remains today is the name, Nishijin. What was once a grim battlefield, now a neighborhood where beautiful cloth is woven. Nishijin is a rectangular neighborhood, with rectangular factories. Weaving binds it together. “Urgently Seeking Weavers” Prayers survive in this rectangular world: Prayers for sound health, for a strong family, for freedom from flood and fire. To live is to struggle against nature's hostility. To live is not to struggle against God's will. Children live in Nishijin as well. They do not understand the invisible forces at work, yet they can see them. The silent laughter, the imperceptible solitude. The fashion show is about to begin in the lobby. Look, you could be this beautiful. Discover your unique charms. Modern makeup, the elegance of a thousand-year tradition. Modern style, the woven patterns preferred by royalty. ...the new Nishijin... ...modernizing facilities... ...the obi is Nishijin... ...mechanize and rationalize production to lower costs... ...reducing prices is essential... ...what's important for weaving is the same as what's important for philosophy... ...thoroughly commodify... ...no matter how advanced, no machine can surpass human skill... ...thanks to machine production... ...it's an evil course... ...in the future, even more modernization of hand weaving... ...innovation in Nishijin's industrial structure... Nishijin, unchanging within its red-latticed houses. Hand-weaving is Nishijin's claim to fame. Father works day and night. He weaves three meters of cloth and takes it to the wholesaler. That's how I get my pocket money. After two days, my pockets are empty again. Father works night and day. Protect history. Please, protect Nishijin. It can't be weighed on a scale. It can't be tallied on an abacus. Weave history, weave authority. Protect history, protect Nishijin. “First Place” “Chairman's Prize" “Special Selection" We came over hills, through the forest of tears. There are mot hills yet to cross. We must choose a path. To the West? to the East? No one person can decide. This hectic world is changing, but Nishijin's age is its strength. In the smell of incense. In the eyes of the elderly. In the pain of the Nail-Pulling Bodhisattva. In my body there is a wicked nail I cannot see, lodged deep. "Urgently Seeking Weavers” "Hiring Weavers: Lodgers Preferred" "Work for Retired Coal Miners and their Families” ”Recruiting Students for Work Training” “Hiring Weavers: Lodgers Preferred" "Welcoming Reception for New Nishijin Employees" Thank you for coming. All of Nishijin welcomes you. Thank you for your hard work. All of Nishijin is grateful. “Young Weavers Wanted” “Weavers Wanted: On-site Training” Children never retrace their steps. Children never walk the same road twice.

Kyoto. A city drenched in the rain of old memories. Nishijin. Flowers of fabric, rain of thread, rain of silk. It's not for you that this rain falls.
