Maleko. Yeah, Eddie. Get over here. Do you hear something? It's that woman, Mahina. She's back. Mahina? Alright, you continue the search. I'll see you back at the office. She's back. Now. That's it, Kainoah. More to the left. More to the left. That's it. Keep digging. We are almost there. Yes. I hit something, boss. What just happened? I don't know sir. I think it was Mahina the Kahuna. The Royal sorcerer of Hawaii. I know who she is. Why don't you run and get that witch? John Young's. Don't let anybody see that. Wait, what are you talking about? We're gonna need to find a new business. Eddie, how did it go over there? Maleko, I need to show you something. This book. That lady Mahina, she gave me this. Do you know what this is? I have a bad feeling about this. The Lost Stories of Hawaii, And Other Fascinating Tales... by John Young. John, John Young. Eddie, wasn't that your great granduncle? You've got to step up your game. You could be related to an advisor of King Kamehameha. You should also look at this compass. It's been in the family for generations from John Young. And I've always kind of looked at it and thought there's something more to it than meets the eye. I've been saving this letter from... It was addressed to my grandmother. It's from... John Young. Signatures match. Yeah, Eddie, nobody can see this book. What's so secret about this book? John Young. Eddie, do you even know who he was? Yeah. He was my grandmother's favorite uncle. Eddie, he was so much more than that. He was an adviser to King Kamehameha, the unifier of the Hawaiian Islands. He was privy to so many secrets. Secrets like? Secrets like... secrets like this. It's a spear. It's not just a spear. It's the spear. It's the Pololu of Mana. Eddie, this is one of the most powerful weapons in Hawaiian history. Do you know what could be hidden in here? The secret to its hiding site. This could get you in a lot of trouble. Looks like it's already starting. I'm here to talk to Eddie Fox. Well, well, well. Nice to meet you, miss... Granger. Tanya Granger. Miss Granger. Please. Won't you have a seat? How can I help you? I need help... with this? - It's not yours. - It's not yours either. Please. How do you know about this book? None of your business. Well then, Maleko, please, show her the... Please, you don't understand. I'm not here to take it. I'm just here to prevent something from happening. He knows about it and he can't have it. Or your compass. - And he's looking for it. - Who's he? I'll get it. Ah, may I help you sir? The book. Which book? You know. No, I'm not sure we've been properly introduced. What's your name? Right. Right. Could we discuss this? Listen. I don't know who you are or what you're doing here, but I think if you came back in the morning when our office is officially opened then you might have better... luck. Oh, that book? The sharks are back from the sea, Mr. Wellington. And we have everything in hand. Finally, that's what I like to hear. Yes, very much in hand. And how's the Miss? Oh, she's doing fabulous. She finally spit out where that compass is. And? It belongs to that treasure hunter, Eddie Fox. Eddie Fox. The name sounds familiar. Well, let's just be patient. Mr. Fox will soon be out of his hole. Hey, you. What do you want with my compass? What's this book all about? Eddie, Eddie. Eddie. What? The girl. Where is she? I've seen that guy before. It's Kainoah. He took her. Took her where? Where he works at. Here. Mr. Charles Wellington's Polo Club. You mean the one to be governor who acts like he owns the whole island? Yeah. I am afraid so? What these ladies get me into? See anything, Maleko? It just looks like an off-season polo clubs to me. How you doing sir? What can I get for you? I'll have a French gimlet - with a twist of kalamatas. - Yes. Hey, Maleko. Do you still see him? I think I lost him. Eddie. Eddie. Maleko. Eddie. Your bill, sir, whenever you're ready. Thank you. Oh, hi. Nice to see you again. I'm not sure we've been properly introduced. Allow me to introduce to you Kainoah, our most fateful right hand man. Kainoah, this is Eddie Fox of Eddie Fox Treasure Hunting Company. Eddie Fox and Co. Private Investigation and Treasure Hunting Services to be precise. All right, sir, presentations are done. - Let's go. - Get up. Yes, let's. I'm assuming you know the way. We found him, sir. Please, have a seat. Thank you, Leilani. You can leave us now. We have business to discuss. The infamous Eddie Fox. Well, well, well. How's your little business going? Not too fast I hope. Where's the girl? Oh, she's safe. Don't worry. I was wondering if you would be brave and gentlemen enough to come to her rescue. So... let's talk since that's why I invited you here. You didn't really invite me here. I came by myself and then your henchmen dragged me over here. No, let's not quibble over details, shall we? I have heard about your treasure hunting and deciphering skills. I also know about your connection to John Young. The book you so kindly gave me needs to be decoded in order to find the spear. As a member of our team, you'd be entitled to 50% of the profits. How does that sound? So I help you find the secret site, you give me some money and you disappear with the spear? Well, yes, but what does that matter? You would be world famous Eddie Fox, the man who discovered the long lost Pololu of Mana. It would be fame, fortune, wealth... Think about it. The opportunity of a lifetime. You and me. Edward Fox and Charles Wellington. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. No. No, that doesn't sound right at all. You think that after all of your treachery what you've done to try to take my book away from me, bringing that girl here, you think I'm just going to partner with you now? Well I think you're the one that's dreaming. If you'll excuse me. I thought you might say that, so I had to plan ahead. That was easier than I thought. Thank you Mr. Fox for the last piece of the puzzle. Pleasure working with you. Would you show this gentleman to his room? You know the spear of mana is a myth, right? So why are you so concerned? Oh, hey look. A butterfly. Ooh! Help! Help! Anybody? I'm coming. Mr. Fox? Please, call me Eddie. Ah, Mahina. Thank you so much for accepting my... Get down, you fool. You and I know exactly why I'm here. Yes, let's discuss this in my office. Okay, go. It's exactly where your prophecy said it would be. So now... what's to do? Nothing. The prophecy wasn't for you to hear. I'm not here to help you, Charles. But you know that. I'm just here to warn you before all of this turns against you. And if I may... You see? Something powerful is coming. My lover, you don't want to look for Pololu, Charles. It'll destroy you. Refuse it. It's my final warning. Oh, come now. Don't let jealousy get into your head. You're a wise woman. Jealousy is but for the ugly. Don't you understand, Charles? You need to stop this. If was not for Kalanikupule's defeat against Kamehameha, as heir of the ali'i-'ai-moku, I would be the one in charge. Don't you see? The only person that can save you and your power is yourself. Mana comes from within. You can't steal mana. In the meanwhile I have to take this book. It is for your protection. No one tells me what to do. What should we do? I have an idea. What's this? Well, it's a personal little gadget of mine I like to call the dis-lock key. Um, are you sure this dis-lock... Dis-lock key. Yes. I just got to give it some time. Be gentle with it. Here... you try. See what it does, it senses the mechanism and once it feels it... Boom, it opens it up. Eh... Okay, let me try something. - There you are. - Ah. - How'd you do that? - Eh. - Where's my compass now? - He's coming back. Charles Wellington. Yes, Kainoah. Ooh, really? Well why don't you come over here? There's something rather interesting happening. Leilani, you look agitated. I am so sorry, sir. I thought that Kainoah had everything in hand, but somehow Fox escaped and took the girl with him. Do tell. It really wasn't my fault. - I simply asked Kainoah to... - Shh. Leilani. Sometimes in life there's a much easier solution. Oh, hi. Fancy seeing you here. Enjoying yourselves? Well yes, actually, we're just about to wrap it up so... I really don't think that is the right direction. The book. We'll burn its first. Well, I'd love to see you try. What are you doing? Oh, it's a good window. Solid. Good shape. Need a hand, Eddie? Oh, Maleko. What are you two staring at the window for? Get them! Hey, Tanya, get over here. Ow, hey, hey. Sorry. Grab them. Excuse me? Coconuts. To throw with them. Oh, that. Yes. We still don't have the compass. Ta-daa. You did it again. behind me. So... can it come and help? Look, I helped you find the book. After all, I'm the one who knew about that mystery first. I have the right to be part of it. I'm too excited. It's mysteries, adventures, lots of secrets. Mr. Fox? I'm done with the mission. - W... What? - What? I just came here to get my compass and my ancestors' book back. Now I've got them. So thank you. And well as they say, au revoire. I thought you cared about it and you were going to help as you promised. I didn't promise anything. We need to deal with this book situation. There's no way they're going to let us get away with this. Why don't you guys take care of it since you seem to know much more about it than me. Mm? You're avoiding the situation. We need to face this head-on. Now, can we just talk about this later? Well, at least try to understand what you're stepping into. I thought you're a treasure hunter. How about your connection to the author, John Young? Should at least have a bit of interest for your own past. Lady, you're the one that brought me here. I didn't even want to go on this mission. We ended up at some maniac's house. So thank you for the case, but no, thank you. I'm sorry I had to put you through this Mr. Fox. I really am. But you know what I'm even more sorry for? I'm sorry for you. I thought you were a treasure hunter, an adventurer down for something exciting. So I don't know if it's because you're scared or whatever reason you might put into your head, but right now all I'm seeing is just a greedy selfish man who just wants an easy-peasy scavenger hunt, so he can make enough money and go with the flow. That sounds like a comfortable life to me, but then don't call yourself a treasure hunter. That just makes me sick. Hey! Forgetting something? So... it's adventure and mystery you want, huh? Well I'll show you adventure and mystery. Come on in. Welcome to the team, Ms. Tanya. I haven't opened this thing in a while, but let's see if it still works. See, I remember it was... Okay, I got it. - Are these all yours? - Yeah. So, am I still a fake treasure hunter? Please, don't. What's this? Just get over here. Alright guys. Now let's see what treasures this book has for us. "And then, in the greatest of secrecy, our most trusted Hebah-hebah Hoapili and mysef took the spear far out into the jungle to protect its mana. The Pololu was beautiful and made with the teeth of a defeated shark from the wild shores of Oahu. Then we passed through the bamboo forest across the river by the banyan tree on the third night of the full moon and brought the sacred Pololu to the cave." Guys. Guys. Hey, wake up. Maleko. Tanya. I need your help here. Come on. Wake up, wake up. What? This is a dormitory? Huh? You think we're just sleeping? We're just getting paid to sleep? I need help with this. What does it mean? Uh, it's a Kahuna saying, right? Yeah, you got it. So? Something about the Moon cycle. Hmm, under Mahealani Moon... That's, that's the third full moon according to the Hawaii lunar calendar. Meaning? ...seek and you shall find. Seek, seek, seek... finding nothing. Nothing in here. That's it. Well, what do you mean, that's it? That's it. That's all this book is about. It's just a fairy tale, guys. It's just a fairy tale. You know? There's nothing in there. Hold on, hold on. Isn't this... isn't this a Huna symbol? Yeah, you got it. It's a Huna hemahema. The symbol to reveal secrets. Why don't you open it? You can't open a symbol, silly. I don't know, you have some new relics here. Maybe there's something that will work. The Waterfall of the Chiefs? That's it. No, it's hidden. Just keep digging. What was that saying again? Under a night of Mahealani, seek and you shall find. Seek. Night seek. Seek. Night seek. Mahealani, Moon, sky. Seek the night, seek the night... Seek the night! Boom. It's all right here. It's all in here. It's crystal clear. Look. I recognize that one. There are drawings. It's a map made of drawings. And all clues. That lead us to a cross. - And you think that cross is... - Telling us where the spear is. - Waterfall of Chiefs? - Yeah. The one that was thought to be just a myth? It's not such a myth as we thought. This is so exciting, Mr. Fox. You did it. Congratulations. - Okay. - Sorry. I was just saying congratulations. Right. Isn't this lovely? Pretty smooth, Edward. Pretty smooth. Now I'm not going to congratulate you in the same way, but thanks all the same. So I'm assuming you still don't want to be a part of my team. Tie them up. What are you gonna do to us? Well, my dear, I have a little dilemma. You see, I can't have anyone else knowing what you know. Loose ends must be trimmed. You will have to be eliminated. You know, I don't think that's a very good way to start as a future ruler. Do you? It's so unfortunate. See... Eddie Fox was having a meeting slash date with the lovely Tanya here. He even lit a nice little candle to set the mood. But then the jealous assistant burst in. There was a scuffle. It all happened so fast that by the time the firemen showed up it was too late. Okay, fellows, let's go. Into the jungle. What are we gonna do? - What are we gonna do? - Shh, I'm trying to concentrate? I need my gadgets? Well, it's nowhere near us now, is it? Nope. But hey, I just got another idea. Okay, so I'm going to count to three and then we're going to get up by pushing on each other's backs. Okay? - Okay. - Ready? One, two... - What are you doing? - You said get up on three. No, I said one, two, three and then we're going to get up. Okay? Seems better the way I understood it. Alright, then. Let's do it. Which one? You lost me. Just... let's just do the way you said it. You're making this so complex. You just don't know how to communicate. - Do you want to burn? - No. Okay, so let's go. - On, on three. - Yes. What are you guys doing? Maleko, I thought you were... Unconscious. Well, no, but... Well, yeah, at first and then... then I was just pretending. Well, what took you so long to get up? You guys are funny. Okay, well, I'm glad you had fun. - Now, could you please? - Wow. Oh, yeah, guys, we got to get going. Eddie, we got to go. But we don't know where to go. I do. I recognized that symbol, the wooden flower. It's right there. How much further are we? Way too much further according to Maleko's map. Yeah, we need to find a shortcut. I remember when I was a kid and my auntie telling me about this hidden path which led to... a bamboo forest. What was that? I've heard that song before. Kapuni? Mahina. Kapuni means "compass", right? Yes. So why would Mahina just write the word "compass"? Well, well, well. Look. We need a diversion. I think I just got an idea. Why are you looking at me like that? - This is ridiculous. - You look great. Just go. Ooh-la-la! Isn't that weird? That's just so weird. You two check it out. Oh, hi. Care for another drink? Don't mind if I do. Hold it! Right there. You two are quite cute. You call yourselves the frenetic duo? Do you need a hand? Wait... let them go. They'll show us the way to the spear. That was easy. Now, let's look at this book. Little Tiki war guy's next. Hold on. What? Go back. Now go forward. What is it? It's different. - What do you mean? - Look. Wait a minute. Mahina. It's not her name. It's a meaning. The Moon. It's a lunar compass. This way. The mini warrior. There we go. It's the last clue. It's beautiful. According to this map it doesn't make much sense though. There's no way there's going to be any waterfall. We wait and... Oh my God, we did it. This is the waterfall. What should we do now, sir? Patience, patience. Just keep your eyes open and your mouth shut. They're showing us the way. I don't get it. Maybe there's a trick. Like what? I don't know. Maybe it's something we should do... about the Moon. Eddie, where are you? What happened? I'm inside the cave. I just found an opening. Come on. There it is. The sacred Pololu of Mana. "When someone learns to be a warrior one must also learn to run." Patience, my dear. Run, run... Run! Now. Thank you so much. You certainly saved us a lot of time. You miserable rat. Claiming a spear you can't even find yourself? Don't be a spoiled sports. Isn't this much more fun than sitting in your shabby little office pondering on how to pay your bills? I gave you a chance to find the Pololu. - You should thank me? - Thank you? I would never thank a man whose whole goal in life is to manipulate everybody into doing what he wants. Because let's be honest here. What's in it for these guys? Huh? What? Are you gonna give them a little bag of gold? Hmm? Or you're just gonna disappear with the spear and ditch them? I gave you a chance to join my team. I told you already. No one else can know about this discovery. We're gonna have to trim those loose ends ourselves. I wouldn't do that if I were you. Well, you're not me. No, but really, I wouldn't do that. And why not? Because that spear's cursed. Cursed? Really? What? Are some mummies gonna come and kill me? I think you have the wrong movie. Are you done? No, I just don't want you to wake any spirits. Save the pathetic ghost stories. Are you ready, Mr. Fox? That's putting it mildly, Eddie, behind you. Whatever you do, be careful, Charles. Nobody believes in you, Fox. You're just a joke. A dusty signboard who takes money from people to find their pathetic treasure. Good night, Eddie. No! Just let me go. Where's Tanya? Who are you? Wait a minute. Oh, wait. I know who you are. You're that Kahuna. You're Mahina. Why me? Why? Why did you choose to give the book to me? Your ancestor John Young was an amazing man. A pioneer and a very good friend of the king. He was known as the Olohana. Wait, you knew John Young? Hevah hevah too was my own ancestor. He was Kamehameha's Kahuna Nui. Him and John Young created a special compass to keep the spirits safe. And when I knew you were the compass's heir, I knew you would keep the book safe. Well, it looks like you were wrong. I mean, Charles has got the spear. It's gone. A lost battle doesn't mean it's a lost cause. Feel the mana. - Charles got the spear. - It is not about the spear. What do you mean? A mana is a free spirited source that is elevated by one's meaningful actions. It becomes from within. Edward, the mana's in you. I don't know about that. Olohana means "all hands on deck". Your ancestors would call upon the spirited words. Sometimes initially you can't find them because it wants you to find it. And it'll grow into you if you let it. Only you know how to cherish it. Listen to the universe. Mana is everywhere. Now open your eyes. See it? Now watch it. Tanya! Where do they take her? Makapuu. Don't even think about it. Go! And now for the moment you've all been waiting for. I know we're missing one audience member, but as they say in the entertainment business, "show must go on." Isn't that right, Tanya? Put that spear down! Edward... you? How? I command you. But that spear down! I'm afraid it's too late for that. Do it. Strike. You have no soul. Leave this island. Never come back. That's fair, Fox. Very fair. Olohana, olohana, olohana, olohana, olohana. You see, Charles, the spear has destroyed you. Mana is a free spirited energy floating through the ocean and the wind. And it finds its home where good deeds achieve. And it leaves where bad deeds come along. The spirit chose you. Take care of it. Aloha. So... what power does it give you then? I think... I think it doesn't give us power. But it wants us to find it within. All power comes from within. The spear is right. It does come from within.
