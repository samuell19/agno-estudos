(suspenseful music) (whirring) (eerie music) - [Narrator] Orton Creswell, a renowned psychic, writer, producer, director, and actor of feature film and television in every genre imaginable. A self-proclaimed father of science fiction cinema, he's been rumored to have influenced everyone from Roddenberry to Lucas, Serling to Spielberg. His contributions to film have gone completely unrecognized until now. Let's finally meet the man behind the monocle. On March 19th, 1909, in Hell, Michigan, Orton Zachariah Creswell was born. His mother, Sandra Baderndern was tragically killed when Orton was only nine years old by the family's pet parakeet, Mr. Britches. Details were sketchy. Orton's father, Jebediah Creswell, was a professional tuba polisher and actor in the Razzmatazz Humdinger theater troupe of Detroit, Michigan. As a boy, Creswell was active in his father's theatrical endeavors, both as a stagehand and performer in the troupe. Captivated by the romanticism of early cinema, Orton Creswell fell in love with the movies. Struggling to make it in motion pictures, Orton found work in industrial films. - My work in industrial films, yes. You know I did over 1,000 industrial films? None of which come to mind. - [Narrator] Plutonium. (eerie music) Ah, ah, ah, Johnny, don't touch that. That's plutonium! - I developed psychic powers at an early age. I went to a carnival. When I saw the gorilla lady emerge from a cage, I was so stricken with terror and fright, I went into a state of delirium. When I came out of it, I suddenly had powers to see the future, be the future. - What was Orton like aside from his artistic side? He was (bleep), he was full of himself. He was always off doing something, I don't know. I don't care. - Well, Orton was... Well, I guess it's probably safest to say, slightly, no, not slightly, completely insane. He had some unique ideas. - The man's a bum. If it wasn't for his father, he'd be no place. His father was a prince of a man. - I guess some current actors would view it as method, but I thought the use of LSD as an adhesive for the headpiece was a bit excessive, and I think that's really what led to our further collaborations, was the fact that I completely had no idea what I was doing. - Do I have to keep answering these stupid questions? Why can't you ask me something about my integrity? - It was not a good time, it was rather the lost weekend for me, and it was work, and I believe I was somewhat sentient during the time. - Creswell could never live up to his father. - You know, I did a lot of good work. People don't remember that. I was good, damn it, I was really good! (suspenseful music) (screams) (screams) (screams) - She had a presence rather like Medusa. Do you have another cigarette? I could use a little bit more alcohol, too, please. - How come I always have to just yell and scream for everything? I am still a star, damn it! - [Narrator] I think we're getting off the subject. Let's talk about their early years in Vaudeville, with Biff Anderson and Lance Feldman. - My work in Vaudeville, yes, it was an exciting time in my life. I was working in a professional relationship with Lance Feldman. (police sirens) - You're tearing me apart! You say happy holidays and you say Merry Christmas, and then you all switch back again! - And then the great Biff Anderson. - Fall into my trance. - We sort of did a comedy routine, a little slapstick here and there, a pie in the face. This kind of stuff with the eyes. Really thought that had potential. - We worked together for a long time on Vaudeville, doing stage work, which is very interesting. It was the two of us, and a dear, dear friend of ours, whose name was Biff Anderson. He was like the glue that brought Orton and I together. One of our Vaudeville acts was Orton, who loved to play the piano. He would sit as his piano, and I was slung across top of the piano. And we dressed Anderson up as a poodle, and it was just, oh, well, you have to see it. I'm sure someone knows something about it. And other movies that we did together, when we did "Ghost Grabbers". - "Ghost Grabbers", oh yes, one of my favorite films. (foreboding music) - This place gives me the creeps. (moaning) - Say, why you bumping into me? (growling) You still hungry, we just ate. - That wasn't me. - It wasn't me, either. (roars) (yelping) - Let's get out of here! (suspenseful music) - Brilliant piece of work, if I may add. "The Man Who Looked Like the Devil", now there was a movie. - What? - Some of the favorite films that I made. "Frackula", which was a sort of a transmogrification of Dracula and Frankenstein. It was brilliant work, one of my favorites. Another one was "I Married a Corpse". - Baby, I know you love me and all, but... I know you're a good listener, but you never talk to me, and sometimes, I just wish you'd say something. - Well, that wasn't my particular favorite. My wife, Miriam, cheap floozie that she was, she ruined that one. That was perhaps my greatest script. - Are you getting the other cigarette, please? - Then I had another idea for a film, untitled, about a young knight incoming. Torn between the forces of good and evil, he travels the galaxy with a large simian friend and two robot companions. He's trying to save his sister, the princess, from the clutches of an evil empire. And low and behold, the evil head of the empire is a dark knight, his father. But ultimately I thought that was a big bomb. - Without a doubt, Orton's greatest film was a film about aliens from Mars. Everything was just really coming together, but he lost it. - "Mutant Swinger from Mars" I always thought was a lot of fun. Dance numbers and whatnot, and of course I played the lead role, quite brilliantly, I should say. - My next career? I don't know, I'm writing a book. Yeah, a biography. Autobiography, yeah, yeah. - Some of the famous people I've worked with include Lance Feldman, Santos Montoya, and the late, great Biff Anderson. Also Shemp Howard. Clu Gullagher, there was a talent. And then some perhaps larger names, more recognized names. Betsy Davis, Sir Lawrence D. Olivium, Marlon Brandoff. I've worked with them all, but they're small people. Creswell is large. - I won't say entirely unpleasant to be around, provided there was a safe distance. And you see, I like distance, a lot of distance. - Working with Orton is, it's like working with God. It really is. - One day, long after my passing, I predict, as my final prediction, that the cinematic works of Orton Z. Creswell will loom large in the annals of cinematic history. - How do I feel now that he's dead? I miss him, what do you think? I'm free. - A few departing words. All I know is that I'm misunderstood. I always gave people the truth, but people can't handle the truth. Maybe another generation will come around that can appreciate the greatness of my works, but don't ask me any more questions. I'm tired. I have no time for this nonsense. You're a trifling and insipid person, a cretin, no doubt, in obvious need of psychotherapy and vitamin pills. - [Narrator] On November 28th, 1985, Creswell hung himself in the projection room during the premiere of his horror epic, "Death Goat". A suicide note was found near his body that read, that's a wrap, you miserable cretins. You are about to experience Creswell's long lost epic, "Mutant Swinger from Mars", a film that reveals the unique and genius vision of a man who lived film, and a man who died film. - Space, a strange and unusual place. A place where one day man will explore and boldly go where no man has gone ever. Hello, I'm Orton Z. Creswell, writer, producer, director, actor, and psychic. I have foreseen the future, and I can tell you this. The atomic age is here. Soon many unusual things will begin to happen, and things will become much, much weirder. I predict that one day a very famous actor will become president, twice. First as the leader of a very profitable movie studio, and then again as the leader of the free world. I have foreseen the wonderful return of a camera shuttle to the red planet Mars, proving that there is life on other planets. I've seen the use of the atom bomb, no longer used as a weapon but as a useful cooking tool. I've also seen terrifying things. I've seen them come, things not of this world. Things from beyond our own puny, infantile solar system. Yes, I have foreseen aliens, unfriendly aliens, sneaking onto our planet undetected. They will take control of our cities, our public schools, our presidents and our pets. Beware, look up, listen. A war of the worlds is about to start on this planet, a fight to the death. Watch now and see what will happen when worlds collide. Watch now and learn about the dreaded goings-on of space creatures that will soon visit us and do the unspeakable. It could be happening sooner than you think. It could be happening now. Trust no one. (suspenseful music) (eerie music) (screaming) - [Robot] Earth. Destroy Earth. Destroy, destroy. Kill. (foreboding music) (UFO warbling) (cat yowls) - Martian chronicle, 5963. We are approaching the planet Earth, a hostile planet filled with beautiful dames, dames which we will abduct for our own pleasures. How soon, Slagathor? - Soon, my liege. - Excellent. Soon our dismal planet will be infested with the cute and sultry nymphs of Earth. - What have they got that I do not have? - Oh, shut up! - Silence! - It's a fantastic idea, my liege. - Yes, soon Mars will be the swingingest planet in the entire universe. (laughing) - But my liege, how will we do this? - We are to use Plan X! - Plan X? What is Plan X? - Plan X is the plan we are going to use to trick the small-brained Earth people, and to collect their luscious chicky-poos. We will take their women. This island Earth will destroy itself as the male species pummel and thrash one another to oblivion. (laughing) - But my liege, how will we do this? (grunts) - We will capture one of Earth's most brilliant scientists, Dr. Vincent Smirnoff! - Dr. who? - No, Dr. Vincent Smirnoff, the creator of the atomic missile weapon system, and of the device known as the Bake Easy Oven. He has also been studying the rejuvenation of dead human flesh tissue, and bringing it back to life. We will force him to build us the perfect weapon, a slick dude of exceptional style and talent, a swinging hip cat. - A real looker. (grunts) - Jerry Lewis! - Shut up! A creature that will lure the cuties within our grasp. And we will use them to replace our own female race, who are as cold and frigid as the moons of Mingdabula. (hisses) It is almost too perfect. Either that, or we'll sick the giant killer robot on them. - My liege, we are nearing the earth's atmosphere. My liege, where on Earth did you get that instructional directional advice? - You stupid, stupid, stupid creature! You think this is our first time on Earth? Of course not. We've been spying on Earth for hundreds of years, and the idiotic beings of Earth have never suspected our presence. They have been too busy with their TVs and their soda pops, and their swing tunes, and their hot rods, and their James Deans. And what have we been doing? - What? - Missing out on everything, that's what, and I'm getting pretty damn tired of it. Do you know how difficult it is to take over an entire planet? - No. - Of course you don't. Well I'll tell you, it's no barrel of tribbles. I haven't had time for a decent social life. It's been an intergalactic drag. Well, now it is time for Xedor to have some fun. And if that means conquering the world, then so be it. I have some conquering to get out of the way. We have to take a right right here, so get off at this exit. (eerie music) (UFO warbling) ♪ Coming to our planet ♪ - What the hell was that? - What in the world? - That ain't from this world. (foreboding music) (buzzing) (yelping) (sniffs) - Ah, mold, dust, cobwebs. I love my work! (suspenseful music) (cackles) - I thought you knew how to fly this thing. - Oh, what do you want from me? It's a rental! - [Fly] Help me. Help me. - My experiments. - Help me. - My creations. (speaking foreign language- Laderhosen Dasmilkencookiesen) My gosh, that's a good pickle! Soon, Kongo. Soon I will have perfected my ultimate experiment, the regeneration of dead flesh! The theory which drove Frankenstein mad I will have accomplished with only a minimum of strain on my own mental state. Yes, soon, those who laughed at me will be eating crow! They'll see me and say, there goes a brilliant and only mildly loony man. (grunting) They'll say, boy, were we morons! We should have listened to him! Not only is he smart, but wow, what a man! (knocking) That better not be the paper boy again. (laser gun firing) (shouts) If you're here about the Studebaker, I sold it last Monday! - Quiet, Earthling, we come from outer space. Mars, if you want to be really technical. You are now our servant. Do as we say, or we will be forced to neutralize you. (tense music) - Who are you? - I just told you who we were. But if you must get personal, I am Xedor, the leader of the Martian expedition team that is going to take over your planet and force you into helping us conquer your world. - I am Slagathor, number one flight commander of the Martian expedition team that is here to take over your planet, and will force you into helping us conquer your world. - I am Pam. - And what do you want? - Are you sure that we got the right house? (upbeat swing music) - [Narrator] This is Rusty Rave. He is a swinger. Most people do not know what a swinger is. A swinger is a hip cat that knows how to swing. He wears sharkskin suits and slicks his hair back with pomade. Rusty is waiting for his friends, because he is ready for a night of fun. Be careful, Rusty. - Let me make this simple. Mars needs women! Our women are cold and lifeless. They have no hearts. No offense. - None taken. - You must build us the perfect chick magnet. If you don't, you will be atomized, and your family will be atomized, and your ape will be-- - Okay, okay! And now, if I don't do this horrible task? (sighs) - Is it all right if I just shoot him? (upbeat swing music) - [Narrator] Here is Mitzy. She loves to have a good time. But not too good, her father has rules. She is talking on the phone to her friend from school, Buffy. They are planning a swinging night on the town. Did I mention that Mitzy loves to swing? Have fun, Mitzy. (ominous music) - It's about time, Kongo! The little one is giving me the creeps. Ah, good, good, yes. (tense music) (laughs) (grumbles) - Hey, go get that! - Sorry, I've been under a lot of stress lately. I was born at an early age, you see, and my parents didn't like me very much, and I'll go get the head. - It kind of tastes like-- (squawking) (foreboding music) (grunting) - I have to get the hydrogen atomizer from my car! I need my keys. I have my keys! I sold the car! - You are mad, Doctor, truly mad! (whirring) (cackling) (zapping) (jabbering) (clucking) - Nothing's happening. (lightning cracks) - Kongo, no! - [Fly] I'm free, free! (speaking foreign language- Ach! Schweinhund!) - [Pickle] Roll away, fellow pickles, roll away! (equipment winds down) - My experiments. My creations! My pickles. (ominous music) Hello!? (sad music swells) Why? Why? I could have been a contender. I could have been somebody! Damn you all! Damn you all to hell! Oh, where did I go wrong? Why did I have to have an ape instead of a dog? Why do I always have to do whatever all the other mad scientists do? (snapping) - Smirnoff, look! (foreboding tiki music) - It lives. It lives! It lives, It lives, It lives, It lives. It lives, lives, lives, lives. (chattering) (swing music plays) (swing music continues) (more swing music- we get it. It's a swing dance club) - Ladies and gentlemen, tonight we will be spinning the hippest hi-fi hits with our very own Vinny V and everyone's favorite emcee, your truly, Dick Johkes. Take it away, Vinny. (smooth jazz music) - So I couldn't help notice you from across the room. It's as if Cupid himself flew over and struck me hard with his mighty arrow of love. - Rusty Rave, you stop it. (coughing) I'm blushing. - I'm sorry, Mitzy, it's just... (giggles) - You're cute. - Touche, my little turtle dove. - Rusty Rave, are you flirting with little old me? - Kiss me. Kiss me like you've never wanted to be kissed before. Kiss me like you never wanna kiss anyone again. - But I couldn't! - Why not, Mitzy? It's as if we were destined to be together. As if the gods of love are smiling down upon us. - I gotta go, I gotta find my friends. - Wait! Will I ever see you again? - Meet me here tomorrow, nine o'clock. - Gosh. Till tomorrow, my sweet. (chatting) - [Dick] Hey, lets give him a big hand. (applauding) - Hey Rusty, Mitzy Nussbaum, she's quite the dame, eh? - Quite a looker you was trying to land there, Rus. - Hey Mikey, you don't think our boy Rusty's being duped by a skirt, do you? - I don't know, he looks like he's in la la land, Steve. - Hey, Rusty. - Hey, Steve. Hey, Mikey, what's shaking? - Rusty, you okay? - Yeah, you ain't getting soft on us, is you? - You ain't getting all doey-eyed over that broad, are you? - Who, me? You think I'd go gaga over some dame like that? I'm just keeping in the swing of things. - Hello, nurse. (growls) (howls) (laughing) Catch you later, Rusty. - Yeah, come to Daddy. - Hi, Buffy, hi, Jody. - Where were you? We've been looking all over for you. - I saw her talking to Rusty Rave at the bar when I powdered my nose. - Oh my gosh, he's so dreamy. - He's the most. - No, he's the utmost. (squealing) - You're gonna be the coolest girl at college. - Oh, Mrs. Mitzy Rave. (sighing) - That would be the coolest. No one is as handsome as Rusty Rave, no one. (record scratches) (crickets chirping) - Huh? - [Man] Boy, is that guy swank. - What's everybody staring at? Dance, swing, drink up, have a good time! 'Cause tonight it's not me, Fez. Fez Fleckman, dig? (chattering) (upbeat swing music) - He's the swingingest. - But what about Rusty? - Who? (teeth clack together) - Hey, snagglepuss. Make me a dry martini, and don't shake it, stir it. And make sure you stir it real nice, huh? Stir it like you's making it for your deal old granny, got me? You ain't as dumb as he looks. You keep staring at me that way and you're gonna see me kill you, got it, Elvis? Good, now look away. I said look away. - Who do you think you are? - Me? I think I'm the guy that's gonna beat your brains out all over this nice floor here if you don't shut up, drink your drink, and look away. - Oh no, Fez. I mean Rusty. Rusty, don't. Your face. - You dance, chickie baby? Let's see how you move that frame of yours. - What happened, Rusty? You never backed down from a guy like that before. - Yeah, you aren't getting chicken on us, are you? - Just leave me alone. - Come on, doll. (upbeat jive music) - Mitzy, I'll win you back! (crickets chirp) (western show plays on the TV) - Why the long face, big brother? Girl trouble? - Quiet, Tabatha, I'm thinking. - Are you lovesick? Maybe I can help. - You? You're a squirt, what do you know about women? - (chuckles) A lot more than you do. I am a woman. - You're a kid. - What do you know? You're just a big, creepy jerk. - Oh, I'm sorry. What do you think I should do? I met my girl, and then she went off with this slick guy who walked into the Velvet. Now she looks at me like I'm an old, smelly piece of fish. - Maybe she's under some weird mind ray of aliens from other planets. - What? That's crazy talk. - Uh-uh, it's all right here on paper. This stuff is happening all around us. It could happen to you. (dramatic music) - Those stories aren't real. It's a bunch of hoo-ha. Martians aren't real. Those are stories written by lonely people. - Either your girlfriend's mind has been zapped by little green aliens, or she found out what a big stupid you really are. - Little freak. Martians, aliens, space creatures. Bunch of nonsense. We'll find out if she really likes me. Tomorrow night at nine o'clock. (smooth jazz music) - Baby, you're a stitch, you make me giggle inside. You crack me up. (hypnotize warbling) I love the curls, Shirley. What do you say we take a cruise on the good ship Lollipop, huh? (hypnotize warbling) I know you dolls is enamored with me, so why fight it, huh? (hypnotize warbling) What do you say we go monkey around later? We'll go bananas, it'll be a hoot. (hypnotize warbling) Ooh la la, baby. You're wearing my favorite body. (hypnotize warbling) - I've always wanted to marry a doctor. - [Smirnoff] Get away from me, you little psycho. - No, no, no, no, no, I tell you that there is a real future in plastics, oh exalted one. (foreboding music) - Get away from him! We are conducting a major takeover of Earth. We are not playing the dating game. (laughs) - You shut up, laughing boy! (snaps) - Keep it moving, single file. - Fez has brought us the first batch of women. - Excellent, Fez. You seem to be doing very well for such a short amount of time. - Thank you, oh bulbous-headed one. - They say the darndest things when they're young. Continue your mission, and you will be well-rewarded soon. - Thank you, but now I must go. I have what the Earth people call a date. - Oh yes, I have heard of those. It's what happens when an Earth couple enters a phase called necking. They drool and grovel over one another until one becomes queasy and the other nauseous. - It sounds lovely. Go about your date, but do not allow the wiles of an Earth chick to sway you from your mission. I have heard many stories of their secret powers that no man can resist. - They grow up so fast. (foreboding music) (hypnotized warbling) - I hope you're having a good time. It's been a while since I've been out and about. Hope I'm not rusty. Say, what gives, toots? - Fez Fleckman, I'm not that kind of girl. - That's why I'm trying to show you how. (gasps) Hey, cut that out. - First you tell that you're going to take four girls you met at the bar home, 'cause they needed rides, and then you tell me you're gonna be at my house at 2:30, and you were an hour late. - I had a bit of business to take care of. Besides, nice girl like you shouldn't be sneaking out of the house so late. Your daddy might give you a whooping. (gasps) - Take me home. - Aw, come on, baby. The only reason I'm getting so carried away is that you drive me crazy. 'Cause you're so beautiful, dig? I think you're the cat's meow. You're the tops. You make me all tingly. I can't help myself. I'd like to help myself, but you won't let me! Are you smitten, kitten? (meows) Mitzy, baby, you're a gas. Let's pop this blow stand. (purrs) (ominous music) (beeping) - [Ruler] Oh, what? - The plan is working perfectly, Your Highness. It is only a matter of time. - [Ruler] Excellent, that is what I like to hear. You might not be the buffoon I thought you were. I am pleased with your progress, Xedor. You may get a reward for this. Don't suddenly become a total boob like you usually do! - Thank you, Your Highness. We will win this war of the worlds. - [Ruler] Good, now get going! (whirring) (eerie music) - [Smirnoff] Stop touching me. Stop touching me, don't. Don't do that. (growls) Get... What smells? - We are ready for the mind melt, my liege. - Good, we must prepare them for transport to Mars. What do you think you're doing? - Look, just because you're the leader of this expedition doesn't mean that you get to have all the fun! - Well the last time, you broke it! - Oh, I'm not listening, la la la la! - How would you like to stand a sentry post down on Pluto? (chattering) - Get your damn dirty hands off me, you filthy ape! (upbeat jazz music) - Hello, Rusty. - Hi, Dr. Von Helpsling. What are you doing here? - Oh, just having a cocktail before class. You look sad. - Trying to win my girl back. - Ah, well if you find you need anything, feel free to come by my office. - Hey, Rusty. - Pal. - Hey, guys. Isn't it weird that Dr. Von Helpsling was here? - Yeah, you said it. - It's as if it may mean something later. - Huh. - What is wrong? What is wrong? (hypnotized warbling) (ominous jazz music) - Mitzy, baby, you're ace. - Oh, Fez, stop, I'm blushing. - Move on. Move on, Rusty. Is she worth this aggravation? Aggravation? No. Not in the least. - No one understands. I love her. Oh, how I love you, Mitzy. But she's with that cad. That, that... - So where have you been all my life? - Masher! - Fez Fleckman, what are you doing? - Uh-oh. Hold that thought, baby, I got a bit of business to take care of. What is it, doll face? - What are you doing? You are supposed to be here with me, and only me. - But pumpkin, you know how I love the company. (giggling) I told you some friends would be joining us, didn't I? - I don't remember you telling me anything. - That's why I ask you to pay attention, sweet knees. Ladies, please, can I have one teensie weensie moment alone with Mitzy, huh? (groaning) Stay close, don't go nowhere. I won't be but a moment, 'kay? Mitzy, honey pie. You know I love you, you know that. I just got this little quirk, that I'm a hard one to tame. You know that. - I don't care. I want to be the only one, Fez. - You are the only one. You light up my life. I could not live without you. - Prove it. - Prove it? - Yes, prove it. Prove how much I mean to you. Prove that you aren't a fraud, a phony, a creep! - Okay, sizzle lips, you are on. (record skips) Shut your cake, socket squirrely, time for me to dazzle. Eh? Hey, it's good to be back. Even though I was never here. (drum roll) (chuckles) I'd like to tell you a story. It's a sad story. Hey barkeep, lay some mood lighting on me. You're beautiful. It's a truly sad story about a gal who didn't believe how much her guy cared for her. How she thought he was a fraud, phony, creep. He tried to convince her, boy, did he try. But it didn't work. Finally one day at the local watering hole, he decides to sing her this tune. Like to sing it for you now.

(smooth swing music) - You heard the rumors? - About what? - The weird lights people have been seeing near Make Out Point. - No, I haven't. - Me neither. - They say aliens have landed, and they're kidnapping people and controlling people's brains, turning people into mindless zombies. Girls have been missing all over. - Oh yeah, I heard Susie Browning has been missing for days. - And Sally Arkoff, and Wilma Castle, and Esther Wood! - Oh my, this is like that movie with the pods, and then they control people's minds. - "Invasion of the Body Snatchers". - No, not that movie, the other-- - "Bigfoot". - Yeah, yeah. - Yeah. Wasn't Carey Grant in that movie? - [Sally] He is so cute. (giggles) - That's preposterous. Those poor, miserable souls. Don't they know that stuff's just in the comic books? Aliens do not exist. - I don't know what to believe. But whatever it is, I'm going to get to the bottom of it. (upbeat swing music) (giggling) - Oh, Fez! (barks) Oh, Fez, you animal! (grunts) Oh, Fez, you animal. - Isn't this better than hanging out with that slug, Rusty? - Oh, Fez, you animal! - Say, what gives, baby? You're wound up like a cheap watch. Oh, come on, bubby, talk to dada. - Oh, Fez, you're incorrigible. You're rude and you're never on time for our dates. - Baby, baby, please. You're giving me an inner-ear ache, for god's sake. I thought we settled this a while ago. - But Fez, I just-- - Eh, eh, eh. I thought that's what you liked about me. 'Cause I'm rude and incorrigible. But on time? You want me to be punctual? Baby, please, there ain't enough of me to go around. You just gotta be patient. - Stop that. - Aw, you don't mean that, do you? Of course you don't. You like me this way. You know I'm not rude to you, sweet lips. I'm to the point. I'm not the kind of guy that's gonna say a bunch of stuff you wanna hear just 'cause you wanna hear it. I'm not gonna beat around the bush. I'm gonna get straight to the point, and my point is, shut up and start smooching, 'cause I got things to do later. - You can't win that easy, Fleckman! - Fez, don't get me wrong, I like you. You have that certain something that makes a girl like me weak in the knees. - Weak in the brain, too. - You're classy, you're swank, and your wardrobe's to die for. But I need more from a man. I need to be loved, and held. I want a little house and a white picket fence, with a dog. - I can give you those things, my pet. - I want to have dinner made when the man I love comes home. And if we have problems with our children, I want my loving husband to go upstairs, sit them down, and give them a good, stern talking to. (ominous music) Fez, what are you doing? - Something I should've done a long time ago. (hypnotize warbling) - Uh oh. (screams) - Dear God! (foreboding music) Doc! - Rusty, what's wrong? - You gotta help me, Doctor. These creatures. - Ah, the evil vampire. Nosferatu, the undead. Now to kill a vampire, you'll have to take a stake. You gotta take a stake and drive it-- - No, no. Doc, it's not vampires. - Well, then the werewolf. Now for the werewolf, you have to get silver bullets, and garlic, and wolfsbane. - No, no, Doc, it's not werewolves. - Not werewolves. - Not vampires. - Not vampires. - It's Martians! - Ah, so that would be unidentified flying objects. There are many cases of unidentified flying objects. It's not uncommon for people from other worlds to come and spy on our planet. In many cases, they do some interesting things. They cut crop circles, they mutilate cattle, and at times, they even take control of a weak-willed person and make him do unpredictable and silly things. - Doc, I know all that, but how do I stop them? - Beats me. - What? - Ah, he's a nice kid. He's a kook, but what are you gonna do? (door closes) - Say, what's with you? - It's true, it's all true! - What are you talking about? - This, this is what I'm talking about! It's all happening, they've invaded, just like in the cinema shows. I'm still waiting to see a giant mutant bug or lizard walk down our neighborhood! - Like that would happen. I told you, but you didn't believe me. - I believe! (ominous music) - What happened out there? (guns firing) - There I was, in the bushes. It was hot, damn hot. It was mid-October, but the heat had no mercy on me. The humidity made it feel like it was 2,000 degrees. - Get on with it. - Fez did something to Mitzy! He's not human. I think he's a creature. (suspenseful music) What do you think I should do? It has evil mind control powers! - Challenge him to a contest. - Challenge him? - If you win, you get Mitzy, and he goes away. If he wins, he gets Mitzy, and you go away. - But what if he wins? - You can't let him win! Mitzy's life and the fate of the entire universe rests on your shoulders. - Well, at least there's no pressure. Do you think it'll work? - I have total faith in you, big brother. - Then by Joe, I'll do it. Fez Fleckman, you are in serious trouble, my friend. (dramatic music) I have a moment to lose. Thanks, kiddo. - No problem, big bro, you big dope. (upbeat salsa music) - I said a dry martini, fruit cake! Did you just touch my jacket? - You and me, tomorrow night. We're gonna find out whose girl Mitzy really is. (chuckles) - And how we gonna do that, Rusty? - Well, I... A swing-off! - What the hell is a swing-off? - I have no idea. But we're gonna have one, and we're gonna settle this once and for all, you no-good, badly dressed goon. - Okay, meatball, you are on. You hear that, ladies and germs? Rusty Rave has challenged me to a swing-off tomorrow night. (laughing) Say goodbye to our local hero. Bye, Rusty. Bye. - Oh jeez, what have I done? (foreboding music) - Can I keep him? - As long as you keep the bucket on his head. - [Smirnoff] I heard that! - Permission to speak, my lord. - You may, at ease. - That chucklehead Rusty Rave has challenged me to a swing-off tomorrow night at the Velvet. - Excellent! An intergalactic swing-off of apocalyptic proportions. This means all of the town's cute Earth honeys will be there, correct? After you annihilate him in the competition of coolness, we will entrance the cute Earth dames and send their enslaved brains back to Mars. Then our planet will conquer all that does oscillate. - You mean swing? - Leave us, wise guy! Do not fail us! - Yeah, yeah, no failing. Do you have any sixes? - Go fish. - [Narrator] These are top secret government agents from the Flying Saucer Field Division. They are looking for extraterrestrial-- - Shut up. - [Narrator] Sorry. - We're in Grover's Mill. 10-4. A-okay. Roger. - New orders? - Mother. - Mother, the agency? - No, my mother. (upbeat swing music) - [Woman] So, you're not from around here, are you? - No, I'm from Canada. - These outfits will conceal us, and yet make us hip and stylish, as well. - I want to go home. - You always want to go home. - Shut up. - No, you shut up. - Both of you shut up. We are about to witness Plan Z in action. - Plan Z? But there is no Plan Z. - There is now. (warbling) (foreboding music) - Ladies, tonight you're gonna see the king of swing. (giggling) - Oh, Fez, you are so dreamy. - Tell me something I don't know already, babe. (giggling) - This is the establishment. - They serve libations here? Disguise. - Disguise. Cool, dude. - Copactetic, man. So, seen anything unusual? - No. No, nothing unusual. (ray gun warbling) - Thank you, let's move out. - He was kind of cute. (chill swing music) (giggling) - Well if it isn't my arch-nemesis, Rusty Rave. Howdy doody, Rusty. - You don't scare me, Fleckman. I know your little secret. Kind of. - Do you? Well that ain't gonna help you now. - Hi, Mitzy. - Oh, Fez, he means nothing to me. Let this pathetic nerd alone. - Hey, what the? - You're right, pussycat, he's just a weasel. - Are you chicken? - What did you say? - You heard me. - Them's fighting words. - So let's do it. - Fine. Let's swing. (energetic swing music) (cheering) - Mind if I cut in? - Let us go and prepare for our departure. - I don't want to leave yet. - First you want to leave, then you don't want to leave. - I swear, both of you. If I had a rubber hose... (cheering) (warbling) - Rusty? Where am I? - You're not gonna believe this, but your mind was being controlled by invaders from Mars. - You're right, I don't. Go get him, Rusty. - I love you, Mitzy. - I love you, Rusty. - [Rusty] Will you marry me, Mitzy? - Yes, I will marry you, Rusty. - Swell! (whistling) (groaning) - Me want Mitzy! Me want! (screaming) (growling) (flesh tearing) (growling) - Dear God, it's hideous! - It's a monster! - That's the most disgusting thing I've ever seen! - Where did he get those shoes? - Watch out, he'll tear out your spleen! (roars) - That guy looks just like me! (screams) - Run, for the love of Pete, run! (screams) (suspenseful music) - Rusty! Rusty! (coughs) (tense music) (shouts) - See anything? - No, you hear anything? - No, let's move out. You never saw us. - We're not here. - We are not looking for aliens. - We are a figment of your imagination. - Brought about by bad SPAM that you ate. - Good day. - Hey Ernie, how's your donut? - Good, how's yours? - Good. - [Dispatcher] Car 54, car 54, this is dispatch, over. - This is car 54, go ahead. - [Dispatcher] There's some strange antics and shenanigans happening at the old Smirnoff castle and chicken farm, better go check it out. - What kind of strange things? - [Dispatcher] Weird sightings, some people claim to have seen a UFO and a badly-dressed monster, that is all. (dramatic music) - Copy that, we're on our way. - What's the matter, Bert? - You know, it's always the same. Ghosts, goblins, spooks, UFOs. Just for once, I'd like to investigate a good old fashioned murder. - You said it. - Well, let's get going. (siren wails) (suspenseful music) (growling) (screaming) - Put her in the cage. - No! No, don't shoot me, I'm an eminent scientist! - My God! So you really did come from outer space. - No, no killing! (zapping) - Ew. - Thanks, thanks a lot. - Oh, I only stunned him. You, pretty boy, won't be so lucky. (growling) Soon all of Earth's skirts will be mated with the superior Martian overlords, and all males of this planet will be dead. Hey, what the? (siren wails) - You just gonna kill me? - What was your first clue, Earth stooge? (ominous western music) - No! (zapping) - Sounds like someone is home. - Oh, do you think? - Why? Why did you do this? (shushes) Whisper in my ear. (somber music) - What did she say? - Nothing. She just licked my ear. You fiend. You would kill your own kind? - You can't make a sweater without shaving some sheep! - Yes, you can, there are plenty of different acrylic-- - Silence, Earth bimbo! - You can't talk to her like that. - I just did. - You'll never get away with this, Xedor. Out of all the movies I've ever seen, the good guys always win. - This isn't a movie, Earth fool. (tense music) This is reality, something you are obviously not living in. (chuckling) And we will get away with this. Do you think Roswell was a fluke? That was my idea to freak you Earth weenies out. - Hey, whose spaceship is double parked? - Calm down, Mister, there's no reason to get jumpy. (shouts) - Rusty, be careful! - Fez, seize her! Take her to the spaceship. - Rusty! - I'll save you, Mitzy! (guns firing) Don't shoot, you'll hit the girl! - Is there anything I can do to help? (grunting) (suspenseful music) (screaming) - [Slagathor] Move, come on, come on! (shouts) (grunting) - Oh no you don't! - Let go of me! - Get back here! (grunting) - Shoot, shoot! (gun fires) Not me, you moron! (suspenseful music) - Are you all right? (groaning) - Oh, move! - Leave me, save yourself. Getting weaker. Must warn others! - Come on, Doctor. - Leave me be. Save yourself, leave me to die. - Where's Smirnoff? - He's still inside, crazy old man. (growling) - Fez, no. - Don't do it, Fez, you'll get yourself killed. - Must save master! Must risk life! - Okay. - All right, whatever you say. - Sure. - Bye bye. There goes a stupid, stupid monster. - I'll never forget him. (sobbing) (crackling) ♪ Amazing ♪ (growling) Fez. (coughing) Who's smoking in here? There's no smoking in the laboratory. Get off me, Fez. (UFO warbling) - Let them go! - But they may come back with reinforcements. - No they won't. - But how do you know, Rusty? - I took the liberty of calling the United States Air Force before I got here. (laughing) - Oh, Rusty. (whooshing) (triumphant music) - Damn that thing! Use the gamma ray, destroy the Earthlings! - Yes, my liege. (zapping) - Eat hot missiles, you Martian scum! (beeping) - Slagathor? Aw, cripes. - [Pilot] Nice shooting, Tex. Now here's one from good old Uncle Sam. Nab my girl, will you? Take that! - Shazbot! (whistling) - Hey, do you mind? - Johnny! Johnny? (screams) (suspenseful music) - Watch this, Mitzy. - This one's for you, Rusty. (booming) - They blew up Mars. - They sure did, Mitzy, just for you. (triumphant music) Thanks, boys. - No problem, Rusty. Take care now. - Now that was a close encounter. - Let that be a lesson to you! - Yeah, a lesson. Tired, but I'm all right. - Who the hell are you people? - We're nobody. - We're not here. - We are illusions. - We are figments of all your imaginations. - Brought about by bad SPAM that you ate, and for the last time, we are not looking for beings from other planets. - You know, it's a shame. Dr. Smirnoff dead, and lives senselessly wasted. - Yes, now we'll never know what the space men could have shared with us. We could've learned so much from them. Cures for our diseases, new means of transportation. - They were planning on enslaving you and turning you into a mindless astro-zombie, for the sole purpose of their pleasure. - Oh yeah.

Well. I mean, he's... The man is just, he's... Well he's given so much. - Well so does Charles Manson, or, I believe, that Jones fellow who killed a lot of people with Kool-Aid, you know? - Man has no talent. He doesn't even know which end of the camera to look through. - He's touched... Well I mean, he's just touched everyone's lives just by being Orton. Well I just have to say that he is my inspiration. - Being near movie theaters was a very beneficial thing for me, because I learned at an early age the art of cinema, how to craft film, how to make works of genius. - [Interviewer] Tell me about your mother. - He's my... He's just everything to me. I mean, if the man were... Oh, I just won't say it, but... - So he relies on his crew for everything. - What was it like working with Lance? (chuckles) Well, Lance had a thing for me, but you know, he never quite really got into it. - Well, you know. Being romantic with her is, in the other films, was, well, you know I love her like a sister, which I mean, by itself gave it many different levels. - But I mean, I tried and I tried, and he just was the only man who never really came onto me, and I don't really understand why. - When he wasn't around, she and I would rehearse scenes just over and over, just countless numbers of times, because she always felt that there was just something missing, and so we would, she wanted to rehearse and rehearse and rehearse. When we did "Ghost Grabbers", actually. When we did that film, I think she and I spent more time rehearsing the love scenes than anything else. Yes, now that I think about it, I don't think we ever rehearsed any other scenes but those. - You know, I had every... I think he was fine. - Preferably, I view her with a great deal of mileage. - She and I, I think, were, apart from Orton, just together on such a separate plane. - You will be my slave. - The man doesn't even know what he's doing. - And another prediction I have is the French will invent Velcro.
