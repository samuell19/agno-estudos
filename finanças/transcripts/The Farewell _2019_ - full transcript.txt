Nai Nai, hi! Do you have a second to save marine life? - All right. - I was gonna say something snarky, but I used to work this job. Ooh, what happened, girl? You got fired? I quit! Because I was about to get fired. Hey. Okay. So one day, the wife goes out of town. And when she returns, the husband says, "Honey, the cat is dead." And she says, "How can you tell me so abruptly like this?" You have to ease me into bad news. Like, um, "Honey, the cat..." "he got on the roof. "And, uh, so..."" Now... a few months later, the wife goes out of town again. And she returns and the husband greets her again. But this time, he learned his lesson. And as the wife comes through the door, he says, "Honey, your mom, she got on the roof." How did you get in here? - Nai Nai. - Billi! Huh? Oh. Eh? Okay. I love you, Nai Nai. I love you. I love you. For what month? For this month? May? And what happened to April? My mom says you didn"t pay April yet. You know, if you moved out right now, we could literally double the rent? So what, you"re broke again? Are you always going to live like this? Poor but sexy, I hope so. Why you not try to save, huh? You should change your expensive lifestyle. Mom, if you"re gonna give me shit every time I come home, I"m not coming home anymore. Lower your voice. Dad"s sleeping. Sleeping? It"s 6:00 p.m. What"s wrong with him? Nothing. He"s just tired. Is he okay? He"s fine, we"re just busy that"s all. Busy with what? What"s going on? Hao Hao"s getting married, so we have to go to China. What? Since when? Hasn"t he like just started dating that girl? You don"t need to go. No one"s expecting you to go. I mean, he"s my only cousin. Don"t you think I should be there? Okay, okay. Do you think he knocked her up? How many wontons you want? - Five. - Five? That"s not enough. Make a dozen then. Ten"s good. - Okay. What"s wrong, Dad? Nothing. You and mom got in a fight? You"ve been drinking? Please tell me what"s going on. You"re scaring me. Something"s going on. Just tell me what"s going on. Your Nai Nai"s dying. She has a stage four lung cancer. The doctor says she has three months. Could be faster, you never know. - I need to call her. - You can"t do that. - I need to go see her. - Can"t do that. She doesn"t know. The family thinks it"s better not to tell her. So you can"t say anything. I don"t understand. She doesn"t have a lot of time left, she should know, right? There"s nothing they can do. So everyone decided it"s better not to tell her. Why is that better? Chinese people have saying: "When people get cancer, they die." It"s not the cancer that kills them, it"s the fear. Okay, when were you guys gonna tell me this? How could you let me find out like this? How should I have told you? "Oh, your grandma"s on the roof"? W-What about the wedding? The wedding is an excuse, so everyone can go see her. We leave first thing in the morning. I need to go. - Billi... - I need to go. Everyone thinks it "s better if you don" t. Look at you. You can"t hide your emotions. If you go, Nai Nai will find out right away. ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ Happy birthday, dear Tony ♪ Happy birthday to you - Billi! - Huh? - Shoulda called first. Mmm-hmm. Stop fooling around. Oil is hot. Don"t be mad, Mom. Where"d you get the money to buy a ticket? - Credit card, right? Mom, I"m fine. Look at my face. Look at my face, look at my face, look. Take to table. Hey. Billi. I know. - Billi... - Hmm? - Ah. Uh... Ah. Ah. Okay. Ah. Thank you. Ha! Ho! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha! Billi. So what "s goin" on with the fellowship? Nothing. Oh, you still haven"t heard anything? No. Well, when are they gonna let you know? I don"t know, Dad. How are you doing with money? I"m fine. - Can you afford this trip? - Yes, I"m fine. - You need help? - No, I"m fine. What is mei nu? - Uh, it means beauty. - Ah. - Hmm? Mmm? Mmm. - Huh? - Okay. What"s that mean? They say you"re a stock investment and you"re gonna make us a lot of money. But I can"t expect that from you, right? You"re the losing stock. Mmm. Mom, that church is not representative of all America. We have a lot of problems. Guns, health care. If you think China"s that good, why don"t you move here? - What happened? - I don"t know. Hey! Billi, it"s the wrong way! He says it"s fine. - We have to go around. - He says it"s fine! Watch it, watch it, watch it. Which way are we going? Dad, do you know where we"re going? - This way. - My umbrella... - Is this the right way? - Yes. Are you sure? - Ma? Huh? Nai Nai... Visit from America? I went to school in the UK for many years. Oh, that"s cool. Where do you live? Uh, I"m in New York. New York. I always wanted to visit New York. It"s a very beautiful city. Yeah, it"s very beautiful. Uh, question: Do you know about my grandma"s condition? Uh... Ma! How bad is she? You can tell me the truth. The cancer is quite advanced. Shouldn"t we tell her? In her situation, most families in China would choose not to tell her. When my grandmother had cancer, my family didn"t tell her. Isn"t it wrong to lie? I mean, if it"s for good, it"s not really a lie. I mean, it"s still a lie. It"s a good lie. How"s your grandmother? She passed away, a few months after she was diagnosed. Illegal. How do you say "illegal"? Ellen! Mom, can we not do this right now, please? - Mom! Can we not right now? Just leave him alone. Nai Nai should not be organizing this wedding. Well, if she enjoys it, then just let her do it. She"s sick. She should be resting or in a hospital. Not stressing about a fake wedding. You really don"t know your Nai Nai. You know she enjoys bossing everyone around. Makes her feel important. Makes her feel in control. - Mom. - It"s true! That"s why she hated to stay in America in our house. You know? Because she could not tell anyone what to do. Whatever I do, never good enough for her. But she can"t say anything, because it was my house. Mom, stop! What? You have always had issues with her, but right now... I don"t have a problem with her. She"s the one that have a problem with me! She "s dying. Can" t you be a little more sensitive? What you want from me? To scream and cry like you? You know, when my father died, I also very sad. But I don"t act like you. When I went back to China for the funeral, everybody was watching me. They all were expecting me to fall apart. And they think if I don"t cry, I don"t love my father. No one"s asking you to cry! I don"t like, you know, put all my emotion on display. Like I"m in the zoo. But in here, if you don"t cry, you don"t put a show, they think that you don"t love your family. You know, in here, they even hire some professional criers. Just to show how sad they are. It"s just so ridiculous. I hate that. Pour, just pour. Yeah, pour, very good. Mmm. - Hey. Hey. Hey, this looks so familiar. Do you remember that house? You used to love to play in the garden. Where is it? - Dad? - Hmm? - Are you smoking? - Hmm? Uh, I thought you said you quit. I did. I will. Go back to bed, Billi. What"re you guys talking about? Nothing. Billi. - Mom? - Yeah? I want to stay in China and help take care of Nai Nai. What? You stay here, to do what? You can"t cook, you can"t clean. I"ll figure it out, Mom. So you just stay here. And what? Wait for her to die? What about the fellowship? Just forget about it, huh? You"re 30 years old, but you can stop your life and stay here? And every day she has to look at you, with that sad-looking face? That"s not nice for anybody, right? You know, one of the few good memories of my childhood were those summers at Nai Nai"s. They had that garden. Ye Ye and I would catch dragonflies. And then we just moved to the States. Everything was different. Everyone was gone. And it was just the three of us. I know it was hard. It was hard for us too. I wanted to believe that it was a good thing, but all I saw was fear in your eyes. And I was confused and scared constantly because you never told me what was going on. And then Ye Ye died. You didn"t even tell me he was sick. So it felt like he just vanished suddenly. And you wouldn"t even let me go to his funeral. You were at school. We didn"t want you to miss school. We did what we thought was best for you. But I never saw him again. And every time I came back to China, he just... he just wasn"t there anymore. And I come back and he"s just gone. The house is gone, A Die"s gone, our Beijing home is gone, and soon she"ll be gone, too. Billi! Does everyone know? I think most people don"t know. But I"m not sure. Thank you. I"m sorry. Sorry, how do you say congratulations?
