I made mashed eggplants today. No french fries for you. Why, mom? Yes, no french fries. That's all you want to eat. Your teacher's been complaining that you never finish your lunch. Either you want french fries or those fried smilies. I've told you many times not to look at that place. But why, mom? Aren't you asking too many questions? Keep walking. I said no, didn't I? Anjali. - How are you, dear? - Hi, Aunty. - Where are you coming from? - I am fine. Just a routine checkup. Great. When is the due date? Anytime. Anytime - All the best. - Thank you. Take care. And don't hesitate to call if you need anything. Okay. Take care. Let's go, dear. Oh no! Good night, sister. - You are coming to sleep right? - Yes. I am coming. The door's open. Come in. Why aren't you coming inside? Sister. Where are you? Sister. Sister... Palak. What happened? Sister... Sister, I dreamt someone dragged me to that land and killed me. I told you not to get... ...the veil from that land. But you never listen. Till that veil stays in the house... ...something terrible will always happen. Where is that red veil? No, don't... Don't hit me! Please tell him not to hit me. My father does not have money for dowry. This isn't about dowry, it's about the spirit. I've dealt with thousands of spirits! No one's ever admitted of being possessed! I'll have to beat him out of you! Stop it. I said I am not possessed. This girl has been possessed by an evil spirit. - Kailash. - Yes, Baba. Bring me a milk glass. Here you go, Baba. "Abracadabra! Hocuspocus!" "Evil spirits and witches...begone!" Here's the proof, of that evil spirit's ash. Bring me a vessel, Kailash. Here you go. "Evil spirits and witches...begone!" I AM A WITCH. - Baba! - All hail Baba! Baba! Baba! Baba! You're mighty and powerful. You are strong, Baba. Baba, you drove the spirit out of this female. I saw it with my own eyes. Baba, you're great. Bless me. - Bless me, please... - What are you doing? Who are you? Hey... I saw it. That evil spirit has now possessed Baba. - What nonsense. - It's not nonsense. - I've been possessed...? - Yes. - That's impossible! - I saw it myself. It's impossible. I'll prove it to you. Where's your vessel, Baba? Kailash! Kailash, yeah. Look at this. This is that milk glass. It's empty. Nothing in here. I'll place it here. And what did Baba say? "Double, double toil and trouble; Fire burn and caldron bubble." OM What is this? See...Baba's possessed too, isn't he? - Isn't he? - Yes. - Isn't he? - Yes. What yes yes yes? This glass is made of aluminium. Baba applied mercury chloride while cleaning it. When Aluminium reacts with mercury it forms an aluminium amalgam. This lesson is taught in class seven. And where's the other vessel. Give me. See... It's filled with water. Look. See. There's Another chemical called methyl orange... ...which this Baba used earlier to write on the wall "I am a witch". It reacts with water to form a red colour. It's not blood. Look it up on Google. Even kids will tell you this. And yes. There's no such thing as ghosts. If I ever see a real ghost, I swear I'll wear bangles. You mean this Baba is an imposter. There is no ghost. He is possessed, alright. Possessed by greed. Possessed by avarice. Baba, I've everything on video. If you ever try to rob anyone again... ...I'll upload this video on youtube and download you in jail. Understood. Come here you. Come here. - She is your wife? Right? - Yes. She's my sister. If you ever misbehave with her again, then... What was that for? Then what is this? What is this? Thank you, brother. You saved my marriage. Don't worry, sister. It's the beginning of your happiness... - ...and, Baba, your wicked life's... - End! End! "Passengers are requested to fasten their seat belts..." "...because there are no exit doors on this vehicle." "Thank you for dancing to our beat." "Dinner's served." Rashmi, what are all the preparations for? How many times have I said call me aunty? It's not polite to call adults by their name. My teacher says humans are known by their name. But what are you doing? Today is your uncle's and my wedding anniversary. Asif will be here any minute with my gift. I want to surprise him before he surprises me. My gift. Ta-dah. I am in no mood for games. Aah...don't you have anything to say to me. Yeah, I did go to the doctor to get my eyes checked up. He said I won't need glasses. Use some eye drops, and it'll get better. Aren't you forgetting something, Asif? Tomorrow is the 31st of March. We've to file our IT returns. Thank you so much. We shouldn't be charged penalty. Quickly make me some masala tea. - I'll fill-up the form. Come fast. - Forget it. Can't even remember our anniversary. Asif... Asif... Asif... - Asif... - Hey... When did you do all this? When you were busy making tea. Start. Thank you. In these three-years you never let me miss my family. That's a lie. If you weren't missing them... ...then you wouldn't be thinking about them today. I know you pretend to have forgotten them only to make me happy. And I wish I could return you your family as a gift. But I'll try my best. My Phone? Finish. Hello, Rashmi. How are you, dear? Mom! After so many years? I haven't talked to you in three-years. But I couldn't hold back today. I was missing you. How is papa? He's okay. But he's never been happy since you left. He's become very irritable. Listen. Happy Anniversary. Our 25th Anniversary is coming up. I want you and Asif to come over. It will be really delightful if the entire family's together. But, papa? He doesn't even want to see my face. Don't worry about him. I'll handle him. If nothing else then I'll say it's you who I want as my gift. You just come Of course we will come Mom. We will surely come. Asif. Mom has invited all of us home. We're finally going to meet Sachin and Ratna! Call them grandma and grandpa. Let's take someone else's child and leave him with the neighbors. Call them grandma and grandpa. But Asif, why did they not call you two home for so long? Sit. Sit. Sit. Now listen. Your uncle and aunty eloped and got married. They did that thinking that the elders will eventually forgive us. Meaning your grandpa and grandma will eventually forgive us. But your grandpa, meaning her father, is a kind of a dictator, persistent... Let me speak. He couldn't digest the fact that I am a Muslim. Is he still stuck on the Hindu-Muslim conflict? Yes, son, he's still stuck with the Hindu-Muslim conflict! He's never met me or your aunt post our marriage. But now... I'll show father-in-law, that Rashmi, your aunt made the right choice. - And her husband is husband no... - Zero! - He's no. 1. - Yes, no. 1. Look uncle, I drew our family tree. - Did you talk to a doctor. Wow! We're looking like fruits. I'll come and check. What's the matter? Why are you in a bad mood? Are you two okay? Are you okay, son? Yes. Yeah. - Sorry. Shaan, are you all right? Yes. Rashmi Anjali. Oh my God. - Look at her. - Rashmi. How are you? I am fine. Congratulations! Thank you. Palak is all grown up. Is everything okay? Yes, everything's fine. But... What about you? Did your father finally accept you? No. But mom said she will convince him. It's their 25th Anniversary, and that's why they have invited us. Great. And who is that? Is he your son? No..no.. Shaan, come here. He's the son of Asif's older brother. His parents died in an accident. So he's been living with us since then. Come on. - Hi. - Say hi to aunty. - Hello. - Hi. And he's my husband, Asif. Asif, you remember I was telling you about my friend Anjali. - Hi, Anjali. - Hi. - That's my sister Palak. - Hi. Uncle, why is aunty so fat? She's not fat, she's pregnant. By that logic Sooner or later even your aunty will be fat... Shut up, Asif. But when is the due date? Anytime. Anytime. Grandpa, let's play statue. No, dear. Your grandpa has chest pain. - Granny... - Ratna, it's alright. Let her play. Okay, I'll make lemongrass tea for you. Okay, I'll go first. No, grandpa, me. - Okay, fine. - Lets Play. Ratna, see who's at the door. Statue!!! Mom. How are you? God bless you. It's been so long. You are looking so cute. Come in. Come in. And who is this? Your nephew? - Touch Grandmom's feet. Touch her feet. - Shaan. Come here, Shaan. We came to meet you, and you left us. - Who are you? - Yes. Grandpa, you lost the statue game. Statue? Yes, we were playing the statue game. Who are you... ...that declared me dead on arrival. - I... - Listen. I called them. - He's Rashmi's husband, Asif. - Yes. And that's his nephew Shaan. It's a special occasion. It's our marriage anniversary. And I wanted the entire family to be together... ...so please, let it go! My family's with me on my marriage anniversary! I don't want outsiders! What are you doing? What... No need.... Sachin! They are not outsiders! They are my family! - I invited them here! - The whole family is crazy. And they are going to stay with us for a couple of days! And listen Sachin, this is not a request, I'm telling you this! Heard that. You already destroyed my life the way you wanted to. She is drunk again. - Hot flat-breads. - Thank you, sister-in-law. Can I offer you a hot flat-bread? - You know what, sister-in-law. - Yes. The food is delicious. - Thank you. - Very nice. By the brother-in-law, what do you do? What is your profession? I conduct religious programs. Where ever we can we serve the followers with our music. "O, Goddess..." I've a strong voice. Wow! Brother-in-law, that small medal there... You got that for your singing. Of course. And the big one is for quitting. He's just joking. Joking... By the way, Asif,... what do you do? I eat...what else? I mean besides eating and declaring people dead... ...what else do you do? He deals in granite and white marbles. - Okay. - Marbles? You mean playing marbles. He is also an investigator. Like the ones that come on TV 'Savdhaan India, CID'. "Something's not right, Daya." That way? No, no. He's the senior member of the "Jaago Avam Committee". You mean he's a security guard. My husband is not a security guard. His organisation spreads awareness against ghosts and spirits. Heard that, Sachin. Our son-in-law drives away ghosts and spirits. Suits him! If he can drive off with our daughter... ...driving away ghosts and spirits is no big deal for him. Son, don't mind him. Finish your food. I never do. Where do we play cricket today? The neighbours in that lane are always complaining. And there are no playgrounds nearby. Where are we going to play? Wait a minute. I met Anjali aunty on my way here. And there's a big ground next to her house. Come here. Listen. I've heard weird things happen there. There is a Ghost there - Ghost! There is no such thing as a ghost. Spirits don't wander. Spirits attain peace (Shanti) after death. Mama! What's wrong with her? Her name is Shanti. That's why. Why are you all so scared? Come with me. We will go and play on that ground today. - Come on. - But uncle, mom said no. Shruti, If I see a ghost on that piece of land, I swear... I swear I'll wear bangles. - What will I wear? - Bangles. Come on. - Come with me. Let's go. - Come on. Come on, guys. Come on, get down everyone. We're finally here. No need to be scared. There's nothing here. There are no ghosts here. Come on. - You know what, let's go play there. - Yes, that's a nice place. - Come on, let's clean up. - Clear everything. Come on. Clear this out. Clear this one too And this one...and that... Sprinkle water. Sprinkle water. Here too. Come on. Come on. Come on. Hold it. Come on, children, to your positions. You be the wicketkeeper. Wait. I told you... I told you this place is haunted. Listen...Kids... - Wait. Asif, you should run too. There is no ghost! "O, mother goddess..." "Dear mother goddess..." - "Bless me...bless me with your grace." - Son... son... break this for me, son. Break this coconut for me. Please... I am in a hurry. Break it... Son, will you break this for me? I am busy. - Hold this. - Okay. Hey... What are you doing? Do you want to break the floor? Stupid Man Wow! What power! You're fit, boss! Where's this smell coming from? Is it coming from the stumps? How can it be coming from the stumps? Keep it away. Give me those, son. I'll wash them in the basin. Do you want to dirty the basin too? Wash it outside. Hey, Mr. Spreading Awareness Among people. Take some water. No common sense at all. No, no... Sorry. Always treating me like a servant. Where are you two going? Go and get dressed. We'll have to light incense sticks to get rid of this stench. Mom! What's wrong? Were you two quarrelling? No. I heard someone weeping. But we were asleep. I see... Okay fine, go back to sleep. - But what's wrong? - Nothing, go sleep. - Are you okay? - I said sleep. Mother. Who is there? Who is crying? "Oh Holy One, bless me with your strength." "Oh Holy One, bless me with your strength." "Oh Holy One, bless me with your strength." "Oh Holy One, bless me with your strength." I didn't see anything! I didn't see anything! Ashwini, why don't you believe me? Last night I saw a dark shadow here. I think it was a ghost. Mom, if you don't mind, did you have one drink too many last night? No. As usual, I had just one bottle. - One. - But I am telling you it was a ghost... The ghost is in your mind, mom. Since what age have you been drinking? Since adolescence. I mean...since the time I can remember. - Are you able to sleep? - I can. But keep waking up. Any difficulty in breathing? Are your lungs working fine? Yes. I do feel breathless. I feel breathless at nights. Like a balloon? Yes. But all these symptoms are common when one has blood pressure. How is this connected with that shadow? There's no connection, but this a reaction. This illness is called Sciophobia, meaning fear of shadows. Having a phobia of shadows. It's a mental illness. You should get yourself treated by some doctor so that this phobia... First, you declared me dead on arrival, and now you're saying she's crazy. Great. The scariest ghost in your life is him! - He's the dark shadow... - Asif! He's my father! - Then why does he keep scaring me? - Shut up. Why does he keep roaming around like ghosts? Asif, what are you doing? You embarrassed me in front of my family. You're not the member of your organisation here, you're a member of this family. We came here to impress them, not to scare away ghosts. Seriously. You can never do anything for me ever. Rashmi, never say I cannot do anything for you. I can anything for you. Even things that you never imagined. I can buy the for you. Liar. Am I a liar? You don't believe me, do you? Fine. Let's go in my dreams. Deepak. Deepak. "O Mother Goddess...!" Dee... Deepak. The wooden horse in the store-room is rocking. Let it rock. What do you mean let it rock? It's rocking by itself. - By itself? - I am scared. Don't be scared. I am there. Yes, come on. What ghost will be scarier than us. - Is it wise to go empty-handed... - Don't be scared. Shall we carry a stick as well? Come on. Look. Careful. Come on. - What's wrong? - See. It's moving by itself. See, it stopped. How can it stop like this? Wind... It was the wind. Good night. You and your ghost. It was just my imagination. My imagination. What is it? Why did you leave me alone? Let's go. (Sanskrit Chant) Panditji. Panditji, please help us. Strange things are happening in our house. We can hear weeping and laughing sounds at night. And we also saw a dark shadow. I think our house is haunted by an evil spirit. Please help us. I cannot tell you in detail about the problem in your house. For that, you must conduct a special veneration at home. "Glory to Sri Hari." To find out whether your house is haunted by an evil spirit or not... ...we'll have to pass through three stages. But priest, we might not survive at the end of these three stages. Quiet! - Stage one; Astitva Vidhi. - Yes, Panditji. Stage two; Vikram Vidhi. And stage three and final stage; Uddesha Vidhi. To perform these three venerations, you'll need Lord Shiva's three-eyed coconut... ...a hungry cow in stage-two,... and a drop of blood from one of your family members in stage three. Yes, mom. He said the blood of a family member. I am an outsider. And I am busy. I've a religious program to conduct. For this temple. Good. Keep the rest of the family members busy in that program. Because except for these two, we don't need anyone else. Why is this religious program so silent? Start the program? When is it going to start? Hurry up and start it. This is why we're here. Where is that Deepak? No sign of Ashwini and Ratna either. - I'll go check on them. - When is it going to start? Hurry up. Hurry up. Hurry up. Where is Deepak? What are you doing here? I've lost my voice. What? Who is going to sing now? Ask this cook. Deepak? - Then you sing? - How can I sing? Then your husband will sing. No. I am not singing. No, no, I won't sing. I've no idea. I can sing movie songs, not religious discourses. But Mother Goddess is the one who makes films too, Asif. - You have to sing. - I... You'll have to sing to impress my father. - Come on. - I... I can't sing! Glory to Mother Goddess! Come on whoever it is. Look, Deepak's here. It's going to start now. Where were you? People are screaming! I lost my voice. What did you put in your mouth? Who is going to sing now? "I am a beggar..." Tune change, uncle. 'Stage 1; Astitva Vidhi.' 'In this stage,... you must keep Lord Shiva's favourite three-eyed coconut in the centre of the house.' Sorry. - Keep it? - Yes. 'If there's an evil spirit in your home...' '...then the coconut will start spinning in its place.' Om Namah Shivay! Om Namah Shivay! Om Namah Shivay! It's not spinning. There is no ghost. Mom...it's spinning! - Spinning! - And it's spinning pretty fast! 33 % confirm. Stage two; Vikram Vidhi. In this stage, you must feed food cooked in your home to a hungry cow. Someone's going to have a feast today. Either the cow...or the spirit! Mom, this side...come on. Cowboy. Cowboy. Bring the cow. Is this the time to speak in English? O Mother Cow. Please. Cow. Hey, cow... Come back. What are you doing in there? Cow. Cow. It's coming back. What are you doing? Someone catch that cow. My cow! My cow! This place is haunted! Run! We know. You run away from here! Get lost! - Ashwini. Ashwini. Ashwini. Ashwini. - What? We're 66% confirmed that this place his haunted. I cannot stay in this house. Come on. My husband built this home with a lot of love. How can I leave it? Listen... Listen... One final test. Let's perform that. - Please, dear. - Mom, we'll both end up dead. No, dear. One last test. For my sake, please. Mom! Third and last stage, which is extremely difficult. This can also put your lives at risk. In this stage, you must turn off all the lights in the house... ...and one of you will have to drop some blood near the lamp you lit. Hail Goddess. Hail Grandma. Hail my mom. - Come on. - Don't leave me alone here, Ashwini! Let's just give one drop of blood first and then leave. Hurry up, mom. Or he'll come here. Hurry up. Or it will come here. - I can't do it! - You can't do it! No! Why did you hit me? Why did I hit you? Why you... Hurry up will you! I can't do it. My hands are slipping. Slipping? Slipping? Take that. One drop of blood and you cant.... - Hurry up will you! - I am. Even in this situation, you want respect. Hurry up or I will kick you hard. - Hurry up! - Yes, I'm trying. Hurry! Hurry up! Now run. 'After that, you must go to a safe place outside the house and wait there.' 'By doing this, you'll be able to see the evil spirit.' 'If the evil spirit licks the blood, that will mean...' '...he is thirsty for someone's blood.' Mom...I see something. Yes! There is something. Who is it? Could it be an animal. 100% confirmed. Lets run away from here. - Oh no! My pawn is gone. - Yes! Shruti, its evening already... ...and your mom and grandma haven't returned yet. I didn't see them at the religious program either. Where are they? They are at the temple grandpa This headache is killing me. There's no one to make lemongrass tea for me. Yes. - Shaan, it was my turn. - No, mine. Papa... Papa, Asif keeps me happy. And Shaan is like a son to me. We're like a complete family, papa. I can't tell you how happy I am. But that doesn't mean we have everything. We don't. We still need your blessings. You haven't accepted my husband yet. Can I make lemongrass tea for you? Yes, and put some poison in it and get it for me. Father, your anger is justified. And we'll leave in a couple of days. But before we leave, there's something I want to say. In Islam, do you know why 'Namaz' (praying) is so important? Because we believe that the distance between a problem and its solution... ...is the distance between the knee and the ground. When we kneel down, all problems come to an end. And every time I have kneeled down, it has been for the sake of your daughter Rashmi's happiness. And her happiness is now in your hands. Please accept us. You wanted tea, didn't you? Can I make lemongrass tea for you? I'll make it really good. Okay. I'll get it right away. Do you want to break my knee? Sorry. Sorry. He is completely crazy. Father. - Your lemongrass tea. - Yeah. Look, Sachin's drinking tea made by Asif. Did you put sugar? Two spoonfuls. Do you want more? I have sugar (diabetes) I drink tea without sugar. Asif. What happened? Where are you going? Why are you looking like this? I won't spare them! Panditji! The spirit licked her blood, imagine. What do we do? That spirit is too powerful. And it's beyond my ability to control it. I can tell you about such spirits... ...but the solution to this problem is not with me. Pardon me. Glory to Goddess. What kind of a priest is he? He can tell about the problem but not the solution. Such doctors should get their license revoked. He's a priest, not a doctor. See, I'm losing my mind, mom. Mom, I know a priest, Father D'Mello. Father D'Mello who? Father D'Mello is the guy whose Cross can destroy any evil spirit. - I'll call home and... - Shut up. Keep your ideas to yourself. They won't work here. If you know a priest, even I know a shaman. Prophet. I remember now. Shahnawaz, I have his number. Why didn't I call him earlier? I'll call him now. Come on. Hello. Hello. Baba... Babaji... - Greetings. - Greetings. Ratna, speaking. Ratna. Tell me, Ratna. What do I say, Baba? Some impure, tainted, uncouth, devil's spirit... ...has entered our home and trying to destroy my family. Baba, my saviour, God forbid... Do you have a solution? Right now I am in The Dargah of Ajmer I will return in 2 days. I see... But I'll pray for your safety. Go home, you'll be safe from the spirit. I'll pray for you. Okay, Baba. Come to the mosque day-after-tomorrow. Okay. Thank you, Baba. Thank you. May god reward you with kindness - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Amazing, mom. Urdu huh! - Let's go home, dear. - No! I won't go home. I'll go anywhere but not home. Your father-in-law built this home with a lot of love and hard work. Come on, dear, let's go home. If we don't leave that house, we'll die! We won't die. Babaji said he'll fix everything. He will pray for us. He said things will be okay for the next two days. Come on, dear. Smile. Let's go. Let's go. Baba will set things right. Everyone must have gone for shopping. Where were you two? - Don't you want to go shopping? - We do. - We'll get dressed in 10 minutes. - Come on, hurry up. Coming. - Stupid people. - Papa... Asif wanted to go shopping as well. Can he join us? Okay. Thank you. That one... No, it's that way. Not this one. It's very... Thank you, papa. Take that off. It's not sunny here. But you are so resplendent. How about this one? I am thinking for Rashmi. Ya. Its good Take a look. Rashmi. Take a look at this one. Isn't this majenta colour nice? The colour is beautiful. - Try it on. - Okay. Asif, should I try this on? Yes, go ahead. What are you looking at? Ratna... I always thought that Rashmi chose the wrong guy for herself. But now... I feel that... Asif is the right guy. Even I couldn't have found a better match for Rashmi. You should tell her that. It will make her happy. Tell me... Pathetic. Asif, is this looking pathetic on me. No, it's nice. It's Double colour. Exactly, double colour. Keep this aside. Yes, madam. How much? Asif, you should buy one for Rashmi as well. - Surprise. - You will like this one, madam. It's light blue. See. Hey mister... Show me that red sari. Yes, that one...up there. Show me that one. Yes. That one. Mister... ...and that one. - This one. - Yes, show me that one. Yes that one. No, not entirely red. Show me that one. Hey idiot, what are you looking at? I said show me the saris. Asif, Rashmi will never wear such loud red colour saris. They are not for her. These sarees are for me. Joke. Joke? That red one and that one and that one and that sari with a stitched border. Show me these four saris. Thank you, mister. Asif, what are you doing? Asif... Why are you behaving like a female? This is not funny anymore. Let go of the saris. I said don't touch me. Excuse me. Can I try? Thank you. What is he upto? Tell me how am I looking? You tell me how am I looking? This is a first-class fancy sari. Where are you looking? I am talking to you. Look at me. Why are you looking at her? How am I looking, tell me? You're looking good. I'm looking good, right? I Love you. You tell me... What colour blouse should I wear with this red sari? Leave me. How dare you touch me? Aren't you ashamed? Pervert! Who made me wear this sari? Aren't you ashamed making a mockery of your son-in-law? He slapped me and left. But ...You slapped him first. Mom, this is very nice. Let's buy it. Come on, let's buy it. Let's go pay the bill. Ashwini. Deepak. Deepak. - Did you see? - What? Your husband...on the terrace... He was wearing bangles and dancing. Have you lost your mind? Who is this then? Who is it? Oh no... how? Hey... It must have been a bad dream. - Let's go. Let's go. - I saw it myself... See... Who are you? Laxmmi. Laxmmi? No! No, Leave me. Don't kill me please. If you had messed with me alone... ...then 'Karma' would've punished you. No! But you messed with my family. Now I am Karma... - Pankaj, now I am going to make you pay! - Please let me go No! Baba, when are you coming home? It's the inauguration of our new building. We need to perform a veneration. I will return in two days. I'll send you a list of items for the veneration. And listen, you'll only benefit from the veneration when the entire family takes part. Yes, Baba. - Just come over. - Okay. Pankaj... Sir, Pankaj didn't show up today and his phone's also switched off. He must be drunk out of his wits, brother. He'll come back once he's sober again. He's never done this before. Our geyser's not working. Can I use your bathroom? Yes. Asif. Asif. What were you doing last night on the terrace wearing bangles? You should see a doctor. Me... I... Listen... Why is he telling me to see a doctor? But no one's going to believe me. He's clearly denying it was him. I think I should go see a doctor. But I am sure it was him. I am sure... What is he doing in there for so long? I left my shampoo inside. Don't use it. Turmeric!!! We must tell her. - Yes, it's important. - There. There. You know, there was turmeric all over the bathroom floor. I nearly slipped and fell. And she is sitting here peacefully...look Do you know what Asif did in my bathroom? - What did he do? - What? He went to bathe in my bathroom. I had kept a bowl of turmeric. He applied the turmeric all over his body. I am telling you Rashmi, something's not right. What is she saying, mom? She's been blabbing like this since yesterday about bangles, and... Bangles! Mom, he was wearing bangles and dancing last night and walking on the terrace. I swear. And he was draping a sari on himself like a female in the sari shop. He slapped me. Yes. - Really. I swear. - I swear. If you guys don't like Asif then just say it. Don't falsely accuse him. Why would we falsely accuse him? Move. I mean...mom, I was going to say I've an idea. I have an idea. Where is Asif? - Where did he go? - Why? Tell me, please. He's gone to meet Khaleel and will be back by evening. Very good. When he comes back, we'll send him to the guest bathroom to freshen up. I'll keep a bowl of turmeric. And see for yourself how he bathes with the turmeric. - He'll never say no to you. - I will not say. I can't tell him, mom. You tell him. He respects you. Just a minute. He's here. Asif.

No, that's not it. Why is everyone staring at me? Brother-in-law, stop staring at me and stare at your food. Don't jinx my food. Come on. Asif. Ashwini said that two nights ago... ...you were wearing bangles and walking on the terrace. Ah yes, you said the same thing to me in the morning. When was I in the terrace? She saw you. You wore a sari in the showroom in front of everyone And you applied turmeric all over your body in the bathroom? Mother-in-law, did you have one drink too many? Excuse, why are your feet yellow? Why are you hiding them now? Why are behaving like females? Stop lying. We all saw you applying turmeric. I saw you dancing on the terrace wearing bangles. What are you up to Asif? So you all know. Well, that's a good thing. Come, let's eat. Why are you talking like that, Asif? Dancing on the terrace! Wearing a sari! Applying turmeric! Why are you behaving this way? Answer me! - Take your hands off. - Answer me! - Take your hands off. - Answer me! - Take your hands off. - Answer me! Take your hands off! How dare you hit a woman? Now I'll show you. Let's see how you feel. Deepak. Deepak. Deepak. So...are you seeing stars? Your mouth's twisted. Ashwini, your husband, this idiot... He's twisted, but he's yours. Don't kill him. Let him go. No... Yes. Get out! He hit me! He hit me! Idiot! How dare he hit a woman. Tell me, granny, if someone touches you, won't you hit him? - Won't you hit him? - No! - Huh... - I will hit him! I will... Yes! Look at him lying there like a bull. I just want to break his face.... Who cooked the lentil? This fatso Was it you? Hey granny, I asked who made it? I did. I did. It's delicious. Who is he? Who is he? Son, why are you eating... with your...left hand? - Mom...you're a good cook. - Yes. Thank you. Chintu, you come and eat too. Come on. Who is this now? Wow...! Chicken lollypop! Aunty, can I take a chicken lollypop? Yes. But I won't eat here. I'll eat there. I'll sit here and eat. Chetak. Come here. Quickly. Quickly. Quickly. Quickly. Lets Run. Quick You've been asking too many questions. "Why are you wearing bangles?" "Why did you apply turmeric?" "Why did you wear a sari?" I've come here for an important job. If anyone interferes or tries to disrupt my work... If anyone tries to interfere in my work... If anyone tries to stop me... ...then he'll get a beating. Okay. See you. I have to go and kill someone Bye, mama. Bye. Bye... Hello, how are you sir? Keys... please. - It's really very nice. - Yeah, it's nice. Thank you. Come. Come. You've stopped calling me these days. You don't either. Okay. Nothing. Yeah... Come on. Let's have a drink. And then order food. I am starving. It's nothing. Just a power fluctuation, that's all. Ohh...I was scared. Why were you scared? I am here! Who is it? Who is it? - Who is there? Who is it? Who were they? That was my father, she was my mother. My entire family's here to have dinner. Then I am leaving. Then get lost. The hell with you. Disgusting. Will you leave if I tell you to? I am scared. If you're scared, then let's just leave. Will he come back? Son, get up. I must use the bathroom... Hail Sri Krishna! Hail Sri Krishna! Hail Sri Krishna! It's me. Rashmi. Thank you. Papa, we must do something. Yes, dear. We had wrong notions about Asif. He's not a bad person, he's just possessed by an evil spirit. We should help him out together. Yes... Today We'll take him to Shahnawaz the shaman. Yes, mom, he asked us to come after two days. But...we'll have to take Asif to him. Yes. Is he Asif or is he... How would I know? You know what, let's go check together. Go see. Why is everyone standing in a queue? Where is Rashmi? Rashmi, can I get some medicine? I've a headache and body ache. It's puzzling. We take the beating, and he feels the pain. Asif, look what's wrong with Deepak. He isn't feeling well. His mouth... Why is his mouth twisted? He's not well. So we've to take him to the Shaman. Because If we don't, he'll lose his mind completely. - So we're taking him there. - Why take him to a shaman? Take him to a doctor instead. On second thought, go ahead. You should come too. Who said that? When the family is in trouble, shouldn't you support them? Fine, I'll go get ready. Greetings. Mom, I'll go buy a blanket for the offering. Yes, of course. Asif, let's go inside. Deepak... Let's go. Push him. Push him. Asif, let's go inside. Asif, you must go inside. Leave me. - Asif, let's go inside. - Leave me. Asif, you must go inside with me. Let go my hand. Asif, you must go inside. Let go my hand. Asif, you must go inside. Please listen to me. Let's go inside. Let's go together. Quiet. Come inside. No. I said come inside. No. Come inside! Come inside! Come inside! No. No, no... The ghost is gone, mother. Baba... Baba... is the ghost gone? No. He's too powerful. - There's much left to do. - Oh, God. What else do we need to do? I'll come to your house tomorrow and perform a veneration. Allah! Hello. Tawde. Open. I want their murderers in two days. Or else you are next. No. Uncle, why are you wasting time here instead of praying at the mosque. What? Why are you staring at me? Listen, this time you get lost, not me. Do you know why? Because you might be the king of your area... ...but here... Lights... I am the queen. Live life queen size! Stop all this! Hey... I said... Stop it! Enough of this charade. Come on, leave my house. Are you all deaf? Salim uncle, as always your daughter Firdaus will be waiting on Junaidpur Railway station platform. But as far as I know, she is standing on the railway tracks. Don't believe me? Fine, watch this Live TV footage. Watch. This is live TV footage. My daughter! My child. Let her go. Let my child go. Don't listen to him. Keep praying. No! My daughter! Keep praying. - Don't listen to him. - My child. Keep praying. - Let me go. - This is not the truth. Do I let her go? Do I? Do I let the train crush her? No. Let my daughter go. - Well, I'll let the train run over her. - Let my daughter go. - Let her go. - Let her go? For God's sake... Now, remember the next train is due in 10 minutes. I'll give you one chance. Go and save your daughter. Hurry up. - Keep praying. - Your daughter's going to die! Run! He's creating illusions with his powers. Your daughter is fine. Don't go. Stop.

What's going on? I've small kids. - Keep praying. - Run. Run. Run away. Run away from my home. I said leave. Get out. Leave. Leave. Fatso, when will you go? You can toy with my people but not with me. I've no weakness which you can use to overpower me. But I do have the power to weaken you. I have Holy water blessed by Baba. No! Not that. Come out of Asif's body. Come out. Listen to me... Don't mess with me. I said...don't throw that water on me. Come out of Asif's body. Hey fatso... don't throw that water on me. I said come out! I won't go. Come out. This is my home. I won't go. Okay, okay... I'll come out. I'll come out. I'll come out. I said I'll come out. Come on. Hurry up. Hurry up. Tell me who you are? Why did you come here? What is your name? Tell me! I'll tell you. I will tell you everything. My name is Laxmii. Run. - How dare you...trouble her. - Stop, mother. Instead of assuming that a transgender is a curse... ...she's dedicated her life for the good of the society. Men like you wouldn't spare anyone or anything wearing a sari. And what did you tell Geeta? Transgender is supposed to beg and cheer. Listen, everyone. The 2014 election provision form now has three columns instead of two. Male...Female...and Transgender. Now we'll run for elections and win. And we'll do what you couldn't do in all these years. We transgender. You men can keep cheering. And you... you... - Mother... Please, mother, let him go. - Move. Move. - Move, Geeta... - Laxmii. Stop! Do you want to get arrested after killing him? Throw away the stone. Throw it away. Abdul uncle was the only one I listened to. My own parents disowned me. Come on...come on...get out! Get out. Get out of my house! Get out. Quiet. If I tell him to wear a watch, he wears bangles! If I tell him to wear pants, he wears a skirt! If I tell him to use talcum powder, he uses turmeric! All his actions are that of a female! I am cursed to have you. Father, every day when you beat me, I feel something is lacking in me. I try to change myself, but I can't. God has made me like this, father. I've read this happens due to hormones. This is not my fault, father. Science! Science! Trying to teach your father right and wrong! Get out of my house! - Get out! - He didn't listen to me. How could I explain to him that God made me like this? Sir, can I get something to eat? Get lost! Son... are you hungry? Yes. - ABCDEFG...HIJK... - Come. This is my house. He wasn't my family or kin. But he heard the whimper of a starving kid and took me home. I want to eat, father. I'm hungry. Your food is ready. See. And here is your favourite. Chicken lollypop. And this is for you Eat. Say hello. Hi. Me too. He's different. He has a weak mind. Eat. Why are you crying? I am different, that's why my father cast me out of the house. I am a stigma on him. Stigma? On the contrary, you're a miracle. When a man's born, he's called 'Shiv'... ...and a woman's called 'Shakti'. But they both dwell in you. You're 'Ardhnareshwar' (God). You are Ardhnareshwar. What's your name? Laxman Sharma. From today you're no longer Laxman Sharma,... ...but Laxmii Sharma. I stayed up all night thinking about our baseless society. How they are afraid of accepting people like us. It's true. Society hates us because we beg. And do other wrong deeds. So I decided not to follow that path. Then I met Geeta. Even her parents had cast her out. Abdul uncle, she is Geeta. She is also like me. But I want her study. Geeta and her mother used their life savings to buy a piece of land... ...where she's going to build a school, hospital and housing centre for transgender. Geeta will fly to Delhi tomorrow and discuss the party's agenda with our leaders for the upcoming election campaign. I will request Geeta to come on stage and say a few words. I am overjoyed. Our dreams are finally taking shape. And all the credit goes to my mother. Mother, please come up here. First of all, hello to everyone. After reaching a stage in life, it's crucial to stay there for a while. And look back. And thank the people who helped you. And I would like to thank Abdul uncle first. Who gave shelter to two orphans. Raised us. And made Geeta capable of doing something for the transgender. Secondly, I want to thank Geeta... ...who made transgenders proud with her hard work. And proved if we're given a chance the sky is the limit for us. People call us transgender, eunuchs, and other names. When my father found out that I am different... ...he threw me out of the house. He disowned me. If he had put me through school... ...then even I would've been an engineer or doctor today. I neither boozed, gambled or kill someone that he punished me. God made me like this. It's not my fault. But if anyone has children like us, please don't disown them. Give them education like other children. Every child gets the wings to fly and the fear of heights from their parents. The choice is yours. What do you want to give your children? What do you want to give them? Superb! Geeta, have you reached? All the best. And take care. Laxmii. Someone's taken over your land. Are you Girja? Stop her! Come on! Hey... I toiled hard to buy that piece of land. Aren't you ashamed to usurp a transgender's land? Hey! Don't try to be a hero with your goggles on. Get lost. Come on. Why you... You fool. You said Laxmii is a woman. You didn't tell me she is transgender. Do you know what a big sin we committed? Her curse could've turned our lives into hell. You're absolutely right. We don't want them to curse us. Here. Return the land to her and apologise. We made a big mistake. I did it for her sake. If she wants to return the land, Then I won't interfere. You'll never face any problems from us. I got too violent in a fit of rage! I am so stupid. I was completely wrong about you. Please forgive me if you can. Here are your papers. Ohh... No. I'll pick it. Laxmii. Laxmii. Laxmii. Abdul uncle... These people usurped our land. When I came here, they made fake promises about returning the land. And stabbed me. They are monsters! Hey... Abdul uncle! Abdul uncle! Father. Father. Father. Father. You killed my father. - I won't spare you. - Why you... You killed my father. I won't spare you. Hey... Did you really think all this is true? We're playing a game. Game... Do you want to play too? Cops and robbers. See...what I have? Gun. Gun. First, shoot me, then shoot yourself. - Come on. - We'll play a game. Game. Come on. - Let him go. - Shoot. Shoot. Yes. Come on. See...game. Now shoot yourself. Shoot yourself. Laxmii, you don't know anything. We'll play this game. Yes...shoot yourself. Shoot. Shoot. Let him go. Shoot. ABCDEFG... - JKLMNOP... - Shoot. - Shoot. It's just a game. - QRSTW... Bravo. Shoot. Just a game. I won't spare you! Brother. Let's throw these bodies in the sea. If the body gets washed up the shore, it can attract the Police. Laxmii bought that land with a lot of hard work. Bury them there. It'll be some use to them. It's said... ...it's a good omen to build something on land where a transgender is buried. They buried me in the land which we bought with our hard work. I had so many dreams attached with that land. Tell me, is this justice? Laxmii, come inside this bottle? No. No. - Come on. - No. Tomorrow is full moon night. If I don't kill Girja tomorrow, then Geeta will never get this land. And this land is for transgender. You were wronged, Laxmii, but you can't keep killing people. Allah has blessed me with a power... So I can control powers like you. This family came to me seeking help. - I will do my duty. - No, no. Come on. - No, no. - I said, come inside the bottle. I won't. Come inside this bottle. I'll come. - I'll come. - Come on. Come on. Let me out. Let me out. I've blessed this talisman. This will keep you safe. No. No. Asif... ...you always joked that you'll wear bangles if you see a ghost. Today you did. Listen to us and wear this for everyone's safety, Asif. Please listen to him, Asif. Please. Wear it. Don't take this thread off for three days. If you do, the spirit will come back. I'll go throw this bottle in the sea. Let me out. Let me go. Leave me. Let me out. Let me out. Let me out. I won't spare you, Girja! Baba, only you can help us now. Baba, my kin are dying one-by-one. And now I am scared. Give me a solution, Baba. You killed a transgender and his family. And now your family members are dying. She's not just a transgender. Her powers have increased three-fold. Baba, is there a way out of it? Yes, Baba. There is one. Today is the full moon night. All the transgender will gather by the seashore. And dance around the holy fire. After they leave, you must dig out their bodies and burn it in the pure fire. And their souls will attain salvation at dawn. And she cannot harm you. Asif...Asif...Palak called. Anjali's been taken to the hospital. There is some pregnancy complication Her husband isn't answering his phone either. I think we should go. Let's go. We must get rid of those three bodies today. Hurry up. Look, they all have left. Hey, come on. Get the bodies out. Come on. Hurry. Hurry. - Hurry. - Come on. Come on. This way. Hurry. Hurry. Come on. Come on. Come on. Throw it in. Hurry. Come on. Come on. Hurry. Come quickly. Come fast. Come on. Come quickly. Come on, come! Come on. Come on Come. What are you doing there? Come fast. Please come. No. Come, come! No! Temple. Where is Laxmii? Call him. Call him. Where is she? Laxmii! Come on. Come on. You can't come in here. You can't. This is a temple. Come on. You can't come in the temple. The night will end after three hours. And with the crack of dawn, you'll be gone forever. After that, you cannot harm me. You cannot harm me. Come on. Come on. Come on. You can't come in here. You can't come in the temple. So what if Laxmii can't come in. But Asif can. You're Asif. I would've been scared of you if you were Laxmii. Laxmii! No! No! No! Put those posters up there. Okay, sister. What are you thinking, Asif? Frankly there wasn't much difference between Laxmii and me. I would eradicate the fear of ghosts in people. And Laxmii... ...wanted to eradicate the ghost of inequality from society. Absolutely right. We've created a rift by classifying them as male, female, transgender. But, when it comes to emotions... ...we're all the same. Thank you, brother Asif. You did so much. For all of us. And I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart. Now rally for the elections... ...win and throw a party for us. Of course. I will throw a party for everyone. Sister. Sister. The goons from the opposition party are burning our posters. They are breaking everything in their path and heading for our complex. Laxmii will wreak havoc again.
