[♪♪♪] [camera shutter snapping] Holly? We need you for a sec. [indistinct exchange] Hey. Okay. So, changed up the lighting a bit to add some drama. and now she needs a touch-up. -Okay. -Yeah. Go do your magic, Holly. [♪♪♪] Looks good. Okay. Urban Gourmet is asking for this right here. Amazing. Do you think your editor over at Urban Gourmet will be happy now? Definitely. Um... I'm not sure if you heard, but the magazine is hiring a full-time food stylist. You'd be a shoo-in if you apply. I have already applied. Two words--dream job. [laughs] Do you think that we'll be finishing on time today? You got a train to catch? Tomorrow. I just need to finish packing. I'm going home for Christmas. Maine, right? -Madison, Maine. -Yeah! Home of that bakeshop you're always raving about? The one with the-- 12 Days of Christmas treats. -That's the one. -Yeah. It sounds perfect. [♪♪♪] [door bells jingle] Holly! Hey! Let me get that for you. Oh! Thank you, Carson. You should've let my mom know what time you were getting here. I would've picked you up at the train station. Oh, no, I wanted to walk in and see the new Christmas lights since last year. Your mom know you've arrived? And my dad and my sister. But you know me. You're independent. I like to do things my own way. I see the place is packed. It's the holidays in Madison. Business as usual. It's not just business for your mom. Merry Christmas, Holly. Hi! I'm so glad you came home this year. I come home every year. This one is very special. [dishes crashing] It wouldn't be the bakery without Loretta. Is everything okay? Actually, everything is perfect. Mm? Oh, wow. I just want one of everything. How about the First Day of Christmas sugar cookies to start? Your sugar cookies are always so delicate, it's almost hard to eat them. Well, I'm sure you'll find a way. Well, and my family won't let me in the door if I don't show up with them. Well, I'll fix a box of them for you, and I'll bring them to the counter. Thank you. [♪♪♪] Loretta, it's so good to see you again. You too, Holly. It's not the same around here without you. Yeah, but the bakery is. It never changes. That's what I love about it. You know, funny you should say that-- I have to make a video call. You'll come by tomorrow and we can just, you know, catch up properly then. ♪ I have news ♪ Oh, do tell. I-- Bup-bup! Video calls? Mrs. Rose got tech-savvy all of a sudden. She does a lot of video calls these days, not that it's my business. How much? I would say at least... once or twice a day. [gasps] $8.98. It's good you arrived when you did. We'll be out of these cookies within the hour, if not sooner. Of course. Mrs. Rose's famous 12 Days of Christmas treats, starting with... sugar cookies. Followed by the "Second Day of Christmas" gingerbread-- And the "Third Day of Christmas" shortbread. [together] And the rum balls. -[laughing] -Sticky toffee. [♪♪♪] Well, I'll see you tomorrow, Loretta. Welcome home. Oh! -Oh, no! -Oh, I am so sorry. -Oh, no! -I didn't see you there. No... Well, it looks like your cookies are crumbs now. [sighing] You know what, let me replace these, okay? I saw the whole thing. Thank you! Well, this is obviously on me. I mess things up all the time, so I get it. Crisis averted. It always is at Mrs. Rose's Bakery. Uh, could you help me with the door? Yeah, of course, yeah. -All right, thank you. -Yes, of course. [wind gusting] Aw, honey, it's so nice to have you back home again. It's good you got here when you did, The call's in for a major blizzard over Christmas, "Winter storm Megan," I think it's called. Well, I'm glad to be back. I was getting homesick. Oh, for Madison, or Mrs. Rose's cookies? [laughter] Gonna be tough without 'em next Christmas. Ah. What do you mean? Well, didn't Mrs. Rose tell you? Tell me what? She's going out of business. Well, no, that's not quite accurate, Caroline. Well, she's closing the shop. Such a shame. Can someone please explain this to me? It's actually quite romantic. She met a man online. She fell in love and she's moving to Alaska. W-What? Don't be so shocked. Women of a certain age still fall in love. I'm thrilled that she's fallen in love, but... She's just following her heart. Carson didn't exactly inherit the baking genes. We don't all have that skill. We all know you can't bake, Mom. Not one edible crumb. [Caroline] Mm-mm. Well, I didn't have to. Thank you, Mrs. Rose. She told me she wanted me to swing by the store tomorrow. She had big news for me, but I guess this is it. Well, apparently, he's a really lovely man. No one's met him yet? Carson has, but he's not saying much. What's the town going to do without the bakeshop? Buy cookies from the supermarket, like most people. Dad, this... right here in my hand, this is Christmas. This is Christmas. Well, you better enjoy every last bite. [door bells jingle] Tell me about him! Oh, his name is Christian. He's semi-retired, he lives in Alaska. Oh! And he was once a toymaker. How sweet is that? That's so sweet. I'm so happy for you. What about Carson? Carson, he has his accounting business. He has his friends. He has a life. He doesn't need me anymore. And what about the bakery? You're just going to close it? I mean, it's your life's work. Christian and I, we came up with an idea. A baking contest! Only... the prize is the bakery. Whoever can duplicate my 12 Days of Christmas wins the business! That's incredibly generous of you. Well, this town has been good to me, so I need to give something back. [giggles] The winner will just have to match my taste, my presentation, my holiday magic. That might be impossible. Well, Carson thinks so. He doesn't want the contest. He says it's silly. He feels that I should just sell the business to a developer and be done with it. No, that can't happen. Oh, gosh. I've given Carson the final say on the contest so that he'll go along with it. So, even if someone wins the contest, Carson has the ability to veto them, and the bakery still closes? I had to do something to keep the peace, but I trust my son. He'll do the right thing, especially at Christmas. He is handsome, isn't he? He moved here from Florida last spring. Wish I could enter the contest. Ah... [chuckles] You're like your mother. Not that I didn't try to change you into a baker when you were growing up. But it just wasn't your thing. You did teach me how to decorate the cakes and cookies. Oh, yes, and you can make food look so beautiful. I have you to thank for that. [Mrs. Rose chuckles] Brad! Brad, I'd like you to meet Holly. -Hi. -Hey. She's been coming to my shop since she was a little girl. She used to work here all through school, too, along with Loretta and Carson. Ah! Well, we, uh, we sort of met yesterday. -Oh! You remember that old inn that the French couple bought last spring? Yeah! I hear they've ruined the place. They've turned it into some snobby bistro that no one likes. Brad, uh, works as the pastry chef there. Oh... [awkward chuckle] And what do you do, Holly? Oh, Holly, uh, is a food stylist in New York. She works for all the major magazines. That's very impressive. Thank you. Oh! I almost forgot. The contest. [giggles] Here are a couple of the flyers. Now, one of our customers was nice enough to say that I could use their special events building. It's a lovely, gorgeous, old renovated barn. I think I went to a wedding there once! It's lovely. Lovely, yes. It's gonna be perfect. Mm. Well, thank you, and I can't wait. Oh. -Bye. -Bye. Oh, gosh, look at the time. I have to go make a video call! -[giggles] -Have fun. Second Day of Christmas gingerbread to go. Thank you, Loretta. [♪♪♪] [Mrs. Rose humming cheerily] It's your Christmas bread! Oh, I didn't think you'd have time to make it this year, with the move and the contest. It has been your favorite since you were a child, Carson. I have never sold it in the bakery. It is only for you. Of course, I took time to make it! [sighs contentedly] No one can bake like you, Mom. You know, I used to love this time of year. All those Christmas mornings in my snowsuit, with Dad, going tobogganing. Ohh, I remember it like it was yesterday. I would bundle you up to go outside. You weren't halfway down the sidewalk before you'd turn around, come back-- "I gotta use the bathroom!" [both laughing] Dad was so patient, waiting around for me right outside, while I was taking my time. He had a Thermos of hot coffee. He was fine. And getting you outside to run off energy was his Christmas duty. Mine was to get in there and work on that turkey. You know, I never did ask you before, but with the bakery keeping you so busy, did you enjoy making all those holiday dinners for us every year? Every one of 'em. Making a meal for your family to sit down and enjoy together, oh, that has always been a highlight for me. [Carson chuckling softly] What are you smiling about? It's all this talk, it reminds me that I still love Christmas. Mm, now, I never doubted that for a moment, Carson. -[phone rings] -Oh! Let me guess. Christian? -We have a date! -[giggling] You go on, Mom. I can't wait to show Madison to you at this time of year. The Christmas lights all over town. It sounds impressive. I can't wait for us to watch the Northern Lights. Now, that's a light show. Oh, that sounds so romantic. And it will be, because we'll be together. Do you ever wonder where we'd be if I had not taken that Alaskan cruise? No, I don't. And do you know why? Why? I never thought I'd fall in love again, and now that it has happened, I don't want to question it. And I certainly don't want to wonder what life would be like without you. Oh, I just hope your flight is not delayed because this storm is coming. Honey... I will make my way to Madison, storm or no storm. You can count on me being there for Christmas. [♪♪♪] Hey... Hey. I'm sorry about what I said. I'm sure your pastries are delicious. Your heard wrong about the inn, by the way. It does well with tourists and locals. The snobby ones, anyways. [chuckles] So... you live in New York? -Manhattan. -Ah. Then you must find Madison a bit dull. Bet you can't wait to get home. Madison is home. Thought Manhattan was home? Why are you entering the contest, anyway? I mean, you've got a great job at the inn. I've always wanted a place of my own, but that requires a large investment, so I'm just gonna win it instead. Thinking of entering the contest myself, but I'm not much of a baker. Ah, then I wouldn't waste your time. Excuse me? Oh, I don't mean to offend. It's just that... baking's very personal. You either have the touch or you don't. Wait. I thought baking was a science. Chemistry. Well, there are recipes, yeah, but... What did you bake this morning? Tarte Tatin. Tarte Tatin isn't exactly Christmas, though. I mean, people want sticky toffee pudding and gingerbread. Well, thank you for the advice, but... I gotta get going. Have a nice afternoon. -I'll see you around. -Yeah. [♪♪♪] So... did you run into any of the old gang? I didn't see anyone. Do you know a guy named Brad? He works at the inn? Oh! Is he the really handsome one? Is he really handsome, Holly? I didn't notice. He's the pastry chef? Oh, yeah. Yeah, I saw him at the grocery store. Oh, so he made an impression. Honey, I love your father, but I do notice a good-looking man, and Mrs. Rose thinks he's lovely. Mm, I'm not so sure about that. Why? He's entering the baking competition and something tells me that, if he wins, Mrs. Rose's will no longer be the place that we know and love. But he is a baker, right? French pastries. Which isn't the spirit of Mrs. Rose's shop, and certainly not this time of year. Honey, I think you're missing the spirit of the holidays. He's just so overconfident. It's like he just assumes he's going to win. Oh, you do find him attractive, then. No. No, not at all. Well, what difference does it make to you, anyway? I mean, you're gonna be off to New York, and if Brad wins, he can bake all the flambés and clafoutis that he wants, and no one's gonna be here to stop him. I do love it when they light a flambé. -Mom. -Oh. Uh, I'm sorry. It's just... It's just so, uh... dramatic. [♪♪♪] This whole area here... Uh, good morning. Oh, morning, Holly. Who's that man? Oh, that... is a real estate developer. Carson is meeting with a few of them to make sure he gets a great deal. But the contest hasn't even started yet. I know. But Carson doesn't believe anyone will win the contest. Excuse me. I am going to go and start on tomorrow's desserts. Can I get you a coffee, Holly? On me. Are you selling the bakery to that man? -I know you love this place-- -I do. It was my first job. I mean, weekends, after school, summer holidays... vacations. You, Loretta, and I, practically grew up here. It's a business decision. You're forgetting about the contest. Look, it's a fun idea, and I support my mom, I do, but no one's gonna be able to bake like her. Your mom has found love again. That's a gift, Carson, but this-- this contest is very real to her. And besides, it's Christmas! Isn't the whole point love? Isn't the main point that it's better to give than receive? Exactly. -Here you go. -Thank you. I mean, are you really not going to let your mother give away the bakery? Look, if someone can truly bake like my mom, then the bakery's theirs. I just don't think anyone can do it. So, as a realist, I'm just getting prepared for when my mom moves away, and the town must move on. Have you told your mother how you feel? About selling the building? About her moving away. I've got-- I've got to get to work. Enjoy the coffee. Oh! Welcome home, Holly. We've missed you. I've missed you guys, too. What have you got there? Uh, I'm gonna try my hand at baking. You know, they have recipes online, huh? I know, but I'm old-fashioned, and this book looked like a classic. Sure is big enough. -[chuckles] -I'll see you later. Okay. Brad? Oh, so lovely to see you. What are you making today? Well, I have crepes on my mind. Aw, crepes! [Brad chuckles] -Nice to see you. -You too. [♪♪♪] [gasps] Can I help you? Just I know that cookbook. It's a classic. Whatcha making? Shortbread. Oh, that's a good choice. It's nice and easy. I didn't choose it because of that. That's-- That's not what I meant. It's my favorite. Okay. Here, let me tell you my secret to making the best shortbread. You take unsalted butter and you add it to the bowl, and then you-- You know, I think I've got it handled, so if you'll excuse me, I've got to find the eggs. Actually, you don't put-- Have a lovely day, Brad. [♪♪♪] Aw, whoa. Looks like you just had a fight with the Pillsbury Doughboy and lost. Very funny. I'm trying to make shortbread the way Mrs. Rose does. Oh, well, let me help. -Whoa! -Mom, Mom, Mom, please, no. Mom, step away from the cookie pan. Well... since you've taken over my kitchen, you can both clean up the mess and put the presents under the tree. I'm just gonna put these in the oven first. I think they're gonna be really special. [indistinct exchange] -Oh! -Oh, wow. [♪♪♪] Thanks. What? Mm-- Maybe you should you try one, dear. Oh! Dad, no. What? Dad, they didn't turn out the way I wanted them to. [Mom chuckles] Aw, sweetie, you take after me. It's that simple. Yeah, I suck at baking. Don't be so hard on yourself. Yeah, but the cookies look really pretty. Yeah. No. [sighing wearily] Hey. I followed the recipe! It's just shortbread. Don't worry about it. More importantly, how's your life in New York? I applied for a job at Urban Gourmet. I really want it. I'm sure you'll get it. It's probably just the holidays, but sometimes my life in New York is not all it's cracked up to be. Sort of like the eggs in this shortbread. Oh! There-- There are no eggs in shortbread. -Oh, yes, there are. -No. Even I know that. Oh, no. [laughing] I was following the sugar cookie recipe on the same page. At least, as far as the eggs are concerned. Oh. At least we have these to make up for it. Yeah, for now. But what about next Christmas? [Holly sighing] I have an announcement to make. I am entering Mrs. Rose's baking competition. Did you hear me? Are you sure, Holly? I think it's a great idea. Thank you, Dad, for being the only one who believes in me. Uh, he didn't even eat the shortbread. It was a rookie mistake. I misread the recipe. I mean, no one loves the 12 Days of Christmas baking more than I do, and Carson had a developer in the shop today, right under his mother's nose. It's not right. Your enthusiasm is admirable, sweetheart. I mean it, Dad. Mom, Caroline, the bake shop is pure Christmas magic, and the whole town deserves to have it exactly as it's been. Well, someone will win it, Holly. -Maybe the Brad guy. -Oh, yeah. That's what I'm worried about. Even if someone can bake like Mrs. Rose, and Carson agrees, once the lease is signed, they can do anything they want with the place. I know how to keep it just the way it is. Except for the whole, like, baking part. I can learn! I will learn! Well, you have our full support, and we'll do whatever we can. Yeah. Hey. To Holly... our newly-crowned holiday baker. -To Holly. -To Holly. [♪♪♪] We have one week before Christmas Eve, and so we're making only six of the 12 recipes that I bake each year. Now, as I stated in the contest rules, I will not be providing the recipes. Instead, each of you will taste a day's dessert and blindly duplicate it. You will go to the grocery store, buy your ingredients, and you will come back here and bake. Myself, Carson, and Loretta will be the judges. You will be judged on taste, presentation, and my favorite, "holiday magic." [gasps] Uh... Yes, Vera? What exactly do you mean by holiday magic? Vera, if you have to ask... [awkward chuckles] At the end of the baking day, whoever has the most points is the winner. Whoever has the fewest points is eliminated. Any more questions? Now, I grew up on my mother's baking and I know what the 12 Days of Christmas desserts are supposed to taste like. Which means if, in the end, no one's been able to achieve the level my mother has, no one wins. What? Is that really fair? I mean, we've all committed so much of our time to be here, and fight for a chance to win the bakery. I'm a fair man, and if someone can bake like my mother, then I won't stand in the way. But I also won't give over her legacy to just anyone. Okay, enough of that point. Let's get this contest rolling! [Mrs. Rose giggles] The names of the recipes, all 12, are in this hat. I will draw one each day and it will be like a surprise. Okay, today... gingerbread! There you go. May the best baker win. -Hey. -Hey. You got everything you need? Yep! Got everything I need. You sure? Yeah. I'm sure. Okay, good. Good. [quietly] Good. That sure is an impressive array of, uh... decorations. Tools of the trade, Brad. What are you gonna do to make your gingerbread people more stylish? Well, I prefer to focus on substance and taste. You know, so my gingerbread people will definitely not be fashionable. [Holly chuckles] [♪♪♪] Oh, no. You okay? I forgot the egg. Oh. I mixed up the shortbread recipe with the gingerbread recipe. It's okay. You can have one of mine. -Here. -No, I'll make do without. It's not gonna taste good, though. Maybe I'll get extra points on presentation and magic. I'm surprised my gingerbread turned out so well, seeing as I forgot the egg. Well, like you said, it's the Christmas magic component of the contest. [♪♪♪] You know, a little extra icing might help liven up your cookie people, bring them a little joy. My cookies are fine, thanks. Hey, uh-- See? Pretty. My gingerpeople are a simple folk. What? Style can be simple. Okay! Time is up for today. Loretta will collect the cookies for judging. Good. Thank you, Loretta. Thanks. [Mrs. Rose] Let the judging begin! [♪♪♪] Mm. Mm-hmm. [chuckles] You brought the fan club. [Holly] That's what family's for, isn't it? We are asking that each of you step forward when we call your name, so that we can announce the results. Loretta here will be keeping a running score of the final numbers. Wilma. Very good try. My final score is 7.5. I gave you a six. I gave you a four. Ooh... Tough judge. [Carson] The girl's got taste. Brad. [thumps table] Well done. I gave you a nine. Eight. 8.5. Looks like Brad's the one to beat. Okay, and last, but not least-- Holly? Final score, I gave you a six. I gave Holly a four. I gave you a six. [quietly] Sorry. I'm no mathematician, but I think I won. I think I... didn't lose? In first place, no surprise, Brad Beauchamp. [all applauding] And the person that is going home today... ...Vera. -What? -I'm sorry. [all applauding] Thank you, and please, enjoy your gift basket. Enjoy! Congrats on staying in the game. Congratulations on winning... today. Ah, I think I got this. Mm, I think you're forgetting Carson. [door bells jingle] [chuckling] Oh! Look at the bundt cake. Hey, Mrs. Rose. Congratulations on the contest. It's really fun to watch. Oh, thank you, Caroline. You know, would you consider giving some of the leftovers to the audience? -Caroline! -What? I get hungry when I watch people bake. [laughing] Well, I'll see what I can do. Holly, can I speak to you for just a moment? -Uh, yeah, sure. -Oh, good. Listen. that was a nice try today, but... you must remember that the secret to holiday baking is the magic. It's easier said than done. Oh, there's nothing easy about it. I have put a lifetime into my baking. Oh! Some of my earlier cookies were not even edible. I don't believe that. Oh, it's true! And I kept trying. Now, I know that this contest is only a week long, but I have faith in you. You can find the magic. [stammering] And what is that, exactly? I know you told Vera, that if you had to ask... Ohh, she has been cooking for a long time. She should know better by now! But I will give you a hint. You have to find that part of you that understands the meaning of Christmas... and then you make that into an ingredient. It's not all about how the food looks. I know that I'm good at making food look pretty, but, for the taste... I'll try harder tomorrow. [laughs] I know you will! I know you will. [♪♪♪] [sighs heavily] "Magic." I don't know if I can get the hang of this whole baking thing. Guess I take after Mom. And you. Hey! Don't include me in your cookie capers. You know I'm more of a savory/spicy sauce kinda gal. Well, I don't think barbecue-flavored cookies are gonna cut it. Not at Christmastime. Fourth of July? Now, that would be a hit. So, tell me why we're going to the Madison again? I'm just curious. Oh, is that what you call it, curiosity? Now, I thought we were stalking the competition. Mm, I think you mean "staking out." I'm pretty sure I mean stalking. And are we? No. Brad won't even be there. Oh. Well, in that case, let's show you the new-and-improved inn, without the handsome pastry chef there to bother us. Now you sound like Mom. [Caroline chuckles] Do you think he's handsome? Well, what does it matter what I think? -Oh, you're so right. -Oh? It doesn't-- it doesn't matter. Not a bit. I mean, I have to admit it. It's... nice. Mm-hmm. I mean, I know how much you loved the old inn, and it had its charm, but this place is elegant, and Madison needed a place for romantic nights. So, speaking of romance, how is your love life? Mm. Ah, it didn't go so well with, uh... Jasper? Jackson? -Jacob. -Jacob, right. No, things didn't work out. And before you say it, yes, I broke up with him. Because...? We want different things. I mean, I want a man who values a family and a home life, and Jacob was a workaholic. [Caroline snickers] What? You are a workaholic, sister, dear. I know how to take time off, like coming home for Christmas and spending quality time with my sister. Mm. Fair point. But being alone in the big city just sounds plain wrong. I don't need a boyfriend to be happy. And while we're on the subject, are you still pining over Marshall? I don't pine. -Mm. -I don't! I mean, I cry once, delete, block, and I move on. So... no one new? Not yet. But, come the New Year, I plan on downloading a dating app and getting myself back out there. Good for you. I can't do the online thing. Well, look, I get you've always been career-oriented, but a little romance goes a long way. I know, and I will meet someone. The old-fashioned way. Eventually. Well, any news on that job? Not yet. Oh, does Mrs. Rose bake mille-feuille? Definitely not. I guess we know what Brad plans to do if he wins the competition. Well, why don't we ask him? [♪♪♪] Hey, Holly. Hi. This is a surprise. I didn't think that you would be here. I work here. Yes, but I don't pastry chefs keep early hours? We do. I adjusted my schedule for the baking contest and I just popped by to check on preparations for tomorrow. I'm Caroline, Holly's sister. Oh, sorry. I should have introduced you. [chuckles] Brad Beauchamp. You're Holly's main competition. Well, uh, enjoy your pastries, even if they're not one of Mrs. Rose's 12 Days of Christmas confections. So, are you sure there's nothing going on between you and Brad? Positive. I mean, no doubt he's just another workaholic that doesn't want to sacrifice his ambitions for family. He probably grew up with a rich family in Palm Beach and went to some fancy school in Paris. Now, it's a shame, 'cause Christmas is the most romantic time of year. The only present I want this year is the bakery. And you'd really give up your work and your life in New York to run it? If you're asking me if I've thought this all the way through... I am. Not really. You know, Mrs. Rose would be very upset if you won and then, I don't know, let her lifelong dream go out of business just because you want to be in Manhattan. That would never happen. Because you'd let Brad do the baking? [both laughing] I mean, I think we both know that my winning is a long shot. Remember, I can't actually bake. Yeah. Hey. Holly. Caroline. Mind if I join you? No, not at all. I'm heading out. All this watching you bake your heart out has exhausted me, so good luck tomorrow, Holly. And be kind to my sister. Always. Happy Christmas. Oh, Happy Christmas. It's good to see everybody so full of holiday cheer. Thank you... for the wine. [clink] I hope you win the contest. It would be awesome having you move back to Madison. That's lovely, Loretta, but we both know that's unlikely. I'm surprised you didn't enter the competition. You must be quite the baker after all these years. Mrs. Rose has taught me a lot, for sure, but running a small business? I don't think I'd enjoy that. I prefer to be at the front of the shop, serving customers, seeing how much they enjoy the food. That really makes me happy. You're lucky you know what makes you happy. Most people don't. Do you? Of course. I love my job. Then we're both lucky. Yes, we are. [clink] Can I ask you for some dating advice? Ahem. Uh, I'm not exactly a dating expert, but, um, go ahead. Have you ever asked a man out? No. Wait! Yes. Once. In college. Did he say yes? No. He had a girlfriend. Loretta... You've liked Carson since high school. I can't believe you haven't asked him out yet. Is it that obvious? Mm-hmm. I've tried. Sort of. I mean, I don't think he even knows I exist, even though I've worked at the bakery all these years. Well, then maybe now is perfect. People keep telling me that Christmas is the most romantic time of the year. I don't think I'd be able to handle the rejection if he said no. He won't. I mean, you're-- You're adorable. You're smart. You're kind. And... his mother already approves of you. Have you, uh, told his mom about your feelings? No. Why? She is the person who knows him best and she might be quite helpful. [♪♪♪] Bye. Heading home so soon? I've got to get a good night's sleep if I'm gonna kick your butt tomorrow. Oh, ho, ho, ho. Well, I doubt the recipe will be mille-feuille. Are you seriously telling me you don't know what the 12 desserts of Christmas are? Of course I know what they are. I was teasing. Hey, do you have a minute? Let me show you something. Uh... sure. It's beautiful. Like a snowy mountain. What is it? It's a pavlova. Prior to today, I had never heard of it, but there's an Australian family staying with us at the inn right now, and they requested it for Christmas dinner. Apparently, it's a holiday tradition Down Under. Oh, before you go, I have something for you. What is it? It's the remainder of the mille-feuille I made today. I saw how much you liked it. Thank you. Yeah, I know it's not a "Mrs. Rose" special, but it's pretty darn good with morning coffee. Well, I'm sure they'll love it. -Goodnight. -Goodnight. This is really nice, Mom. We don't get to do this all that often. So, how does shopping in Madison compare to New York? Uh... less crowds. More families. Cute local businesses. In other words, it's, uh, it's more fun. [chuckles] Careful, Holly. You're starting to sound like you miss it here. Hi, Brad! Hey! Doing a little shopping? Oh, I'm done shopping. Oh, Holly mentioned that you showed her a pavlova you made. Did she? Ooh, it sounds spectacular. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna head home and I'm gonna let you two discuss the contest. So, any other presents to buy? Uh, no, I'm all done. Ah. I'm actually contemplating buying this scarf. [snickers] It looks, uh... warm. Well, it's my first Christmas outside of Florida, so I think I need warm. Mm. -It's warm, you know... -Yeah. But is it fashionable? You're from New York, right, so, thoughts? I mean, that scarf is all the rage in Manhattan. -Done. Buying it. -No, no, no! I was just kidding. New Yorkers do not kid about fashion. I'm not a New Yorker. I'm a local girl. Okay, well, local girl, it's too late, I'm buying it, it's mine. Uh, Brad? Yeah? We're really late. Oh, shoot! -I'm gonna go pay for this. -Okay. -Yeah. -[laughs] Okay. [Brad] I love this scarf! Hmm. Sticky Toffee Pudding! -Yes! -You're excited. It's my favorite. [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] I've never had sticky toffee pudding. [scoffs] What? You've worked here all these years and you've never tried it? It's a 12 Days of Christmas classic. Crazy, right? It's never appealed to me. I think it's the name. What's it taste like? Sticky toffee. [♪♪♪] Here. You should try some of the good stuff before you judge the rest. It's good, right? It's amazing. [chuckles] Um... Carson, can I ask you something? Yeah, yeah. What is it? Who do you think, um, will win? No one. I mean, none of these people can touch my mother's baking. With her gone, the shop's better off closing. You don't really think that, do you? It's the end of an era. [phone rings] I've gotta get this. Okay, ladies and Brad, time to put those puddin's in the oven. [♪♪♪] Oh... there's something on your face there. Yeah, just a little higher. Ah, just the top of-- Actually, can I--? Yeah. Thanks. [♪♪♪] Got it. Thanks. Could you step forward, Holly? Eight. Eight and a half. [Carson] Wow. Your pudding seems to be a favorite with my mom and Loretta, but it just didn't do it for me. -Not sticky enough? -[Carson chuckles] It just didn't taste right. I'm not feeling the magic. Holly, I'm giving you a four. [Loretta] Let me add up the scores. [♪♪♪] Congratulations, Holly. You have survived another round! -Thank you and enjoy! -Sorry. [all applauding] Hey. Congrats. Thank you. Brad, Holly-- would you mind staying and cleaning together? Two sets of hands make for light work. Uh, yeah, sure. [Mrs. Rose] Oh, good. Thank you. Delicious. How could you give her a four? -It's so good. -She still made it through. She's got another chance. [Holly] Hey! Mm! This is delicious. Oh, wow! I don't think I'd be able to tell the difference between yours and Mrs. Rose's. Yeah, but yours is beautiful. Mine looks like sticky mud. Ah, a little bit. I think I need to work on my decorating skills. Mm-mm. Just takes practice. Until tomorrow. Actually, I was wondering if you wouldn't mind giving me a holiday tour of Madison? Holiday tour? Yeah. Yeah, you're the local girl, right? Show me the Christmas sights. All right. You're on. Okay. So have you heard about "Winter Storm Megan" that's coming in? Yeah, it's supposed to be the biggest blizzard on record. Ooh. I love snowstorms. Really? What do you love about them? Something about the way the snow whirls and twirls and coats everything in this cottony blanket of white, like a frozen cloud. And even though there's wind, there's this silence that's so serene. You make it sound so beautiful. Well, if it does happen, this will be my first. [gasps] I'm so jealous! It's your first time experiencing it? [laughs] Well, given my luck, I'll probably be stuck on the turnpike instead of tucked away by a cozy fire. Well, just keep an eye on the weather. Maybe you'll be lucky. [Brad chuckles] A local artist brings these every year. They're so beautiful. Mm. Which one's your favorite? I love this one. Mm. Excuse me? Can I take one of these? Thanks. Merry Christmas. So, have you set up a tree yet? I'm working on it. Oh, you better get on that. Yes, ma'am. Mm. Thank you. Wanna go through the gardens? Yes! They're beautiful this time of year. Oh, yeah? So how was Christmas in Florida? Hot and humid. But very festive. Yeah. We know how to celebrate, that's for sure. Mm-hmm. Hey, why do you want the bakery so badly? Um... For my memories. My childhood. You know, I worked at the shop all through school. And there's a lot of love there. And the baking, and the happiness it brings people... It's magic. All that time I spent with helping Mrs. Rose decorate cakes and cookies is what inspired me to become a food stylist. I suppose I'm just afraid that if the bakery closes, I'll lose that part of myself, too. Hmm. But would you really be happy as a small-town business owner? Honestly? I think I would be happier running the bakery in Madison than I am in New York. So, yes, I would be happy in the bakeshop. You wouldn't miss all those stylish Manhattan friends if you stayed here? See, I love New York. I do. I love my work. But being close to friends and family and the places you love, doing the things you love, nothing can beat it. The contest has shown me that. Well, I guess we both really want to win then. We do... but it's a moot point. Why's that? [snickers] You're the star baker! I was second from the bottom today. Winning the bakery is a fantasy for me. Hmm. I mean, realistically, I'll go back to New York and to my job, and you will be the new owner of Mrs. Rose's Bakery. Well, not if Carson has anything to say about it. I don't think even Carson would be able to tell the difference between your baking and his mom's. -Wow. -Mm? -Now, that is a compliment. -I know, right? [laughs] [inhales sharply] Ooh, it's cold. Yeah. Let's get a move-on? -Yeah, let's go. -Okay. [Holly] So, this is me. [Brad] What a lovely place to grow up. Hey, thanks for showing me what a Madison Christmas is all about. [Holly] And thank you for walking me home. And thank you for indulging my gallantry. [both laughing] Until tomorrow. -Goodnight. -Goodnight. [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] Holly? What are you doing here so early? What are you doing here so early? I just came to practice my decorating skills. Why are you decorating? Do you know what the next dessert is? What do you think it's gonna be? Maybe one of the cookies. I was practicing on my baking. Cookies, huh? Which ones? You'll have to wait and find out. Okay. [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] Enjoy! [all applauding] Ooh. Today, we sent another contestant home, leaving you four finalists. Only three recipes left and we will announce the winner. After I do the final taste test. Well, Christian and I came up with a little twist. Whoever the last baker is will place their dessert next to mine. We will blindfold Carson and then he will do his final taste test. My dear, if you pick my baking over the winner, then we will sell the bakery, but if you pick the winner over mine, then they will have won the bakery, fair and square. [Mrs. Rose giggles] Challenge accepted. Oh! Good! Wonderful! I knew you'd understand. Okay, back to work! Back to work! [Mrs. Rose giggling] You thinking what I'm thinking, Mom? Oh, I'm way ahead of you, daughter. Congrats to you both. -Thanks, Mom. -Thank you. Uh, Brad, I was wondering if you'd like to join our family this evening. We're gonna finish trimming the Christmas tree. I'm sure Brad's busy. No, I would-- I would love to. Wonderful! Oh, and don't forget to bring your cookies-- both of you-- so I can serve them while we decorate. Okay, Mom, let's go. I guess we'd better get cleaned up then. Yeah. I'm not a baker, but... she really is improving. Well, she really wants to win. Well, she won't. Well, we can't be sure. [chuckles] Oh, Brad. You're a gentleman, but you're clearly the frontrunner. All we ask is that you continue the 12 Days of Christmas baking when you own the place. I promise. Is that Holly? Yeah. Aw. Wasn't she adorable? She is. I mean... was. [Holly] Mom. [footsteps] Why are you showing Brad baby photos of me? Because you're adorable. Your mom didn't show it to me. I saw it. You really were adorable, by the way. Thanks. Uh, why don't we finish trimming the Christmas tree? [♪♪♪] [all chatting] Okay, so, I didn't expect to make it to the final four, but I have a feeling that these cookies are going to be really good. Thanks, sweetie. -Let's have some. -All right. Mm. Oh, did you put an egg in again? You know what, it has really, really good crunch, dear. Mm-hmm. Crunch. Okay, well, try one of Brad's. It's not so bad, I mean... -Thanks, honey. -Thanks. Oh... Now, that's a Christmas cookie. Mm-hmm. Oh, that's good. -Your classic shortbread. -That's really good. It's just shortbread, guys, it's nothing special. -Melts in your mouth. -Mm-hmm. Thanks. Thanks, guys. Thanks. Holly! Excuse me. Oh, so good! We have to be nicer to her. Hey. Sorry about that. I, uh, didn't mean to-- No, it's-- it's fine. Just my sister and my dad and... Yeah, I get it. Family during the holidays, right? Yeah. Um... Please, sit. [Brad shivers] Speaking of family... the competition's on Christmas Eve. What about Christmas Day? Are you going to catch a flight to Florida? Yeah, I thought about it. Briefly. But, um, I don't have a lot of family left in Fort Myers, so, uh, thought it would be nice to have a white Christmas, for once. [laughs] That's funny. When you live north, you go south for the winter, and you want to stay for the deep freeze. [laughs] Yeah. I like to go against the grain a little bit. Makes life more exciting. Can I ask you something? Yeah. Anything. You have to be completely honest with me. That's all I'll ever be with you, Holly. If I'm so bad, how did I make it to the top four? I mean, was everybody else just worse than me, or...? Okay, I get it. I'm not good but I'm not the worst. Yet. You want honesty, right? Yes, please. You need to put more emotion into it. But I thought baking was just chemistry. Follow a recipe perfectly, and then you decorate it perfectly, and it turns out perfect? You're forgetting the third category Mrs. Rose mentioned. The magic. Yeah. How you feel about the bakeshop, all those reasons you told me you wanted to win... that needs to be added to the mix of everything you're making. Hey, do you think your parents would mind if we got out of here for a little bit? I don't think they'd mind at all. All right, let's go. Come on, let's go. Okay, now you gotta-- you gotta stir the batter. That's it, only put some heart into it. [laughing] -All right. -There you go. Okay. Now. Smell the nutmeg. Mm? Mm! Mm-hmm. Now, instead of looking at the recipe, I want you to feel it, and then decide how much nutmeg to put in, and then taste the batter. [chuckles uneasily] Okay. Uh... that's it. Too much? [laughs] Well, don't ask! You gotta feel it, taste it. Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. I think it needs more? Don't ask. Feel. Taste. [uneasily] Mm... I think that's enough. All right. Stir it in good. -Okay. -Yeah. I think it's good! Perfect. Mm-kay. Let's pour it in. Let's do this. Okay. Yeah, that's it. Beautiful. Nice. Bailey's? [Holly] Yes, please. I can't believe this cheesecake turned out so good. You were right. [clink] I should go. I'll drive you home. No, no. It's not a long walk. No. I-I insist. Then can I take some cheesecake with me? For homework. You know, "homework" gives me another idea. Really? [door thumps open] [Brad and Holly chuckling] Are you sure the owners won't mind? Yeah, no, they'll be fast asleep, and that part of the inn's far enough away that no one can hear us. I feel like a spy. You are. A baking spy. [chuckles] All right. Okay, now, the flour and sugar are under the island there. Wait, I thought you were showing me the kitchen, not putting me to work. Well, you said you wanted homework, right? This is sort of like homework. I hated homework in high school. [chuckles] Okay. Here we go. Oh, and also, grab those two bowls, please? Thank you. You're right, by the way. I didn't bring you here just to show you the kitchen. Then... why? I have a confession to make. What confession? I kinda forgot to make the croissants for the breakfast menu tomorrow. Oh! Oh, that's a problem. Yeah. Yeah, I-I-I've just been so busy with the contest, and it just kind of slipped my mind. So do you want to make them now? Will you help? Confession. You hate croissants? Oh, I love them, and I've always wanted to know how to make them. Excellent. It's a lovely room. It's more lovely with you in it. Here, come on, let's, uh, test out our homework. I can't believe I made these. Well... helped. We make a good team. Cheesecake, croissants... You're a great teacher. Oh, no. You just needed a little encouragement. I have another confession. Why am I not surprised? There are no croissants on the menu tomorrow. [♪♪♪] Doesn't make sense. How is it possible? Maybe it's a conspiracy. Uh, trouble, ladies? There's no nutmeg. None. It's completely gone. What, at Christmas? The shipment got stuck in "Winter Storm Megan" that's coming this way. Not much we can do. But nutmeg is a key ingredient. None of us will win if there's no nutmeg. [♪♪♪] Where did you go? Home. I have a stash of nutmeg. Remember, we used some last night? Thank you! Nathalie... Wilma... nutmeg's on me. [♪♪♪] Let's do this. Good try, Wilma. [all applauding] Good job. [♪♪♪] Wow, I'm really impressed. The contest is almost over. Yeah, can't wait. Worried about the blind tasting? Not at all. I know my mom's baking better than anyone. I know how important it is to be with family during the holidays. I, um... I really miss my father. It's been five years, but it feels like just yesterday we were spending long hours in the bakeshop, filling out orders. Well... you could always spend Christmas with me next year. If, you know, you're not in Alaska. Yeah, Alaska's too far anyways. [♪♪♪] Hey, do you want to come over for dinner tonight? For another baking lesson? No. That meal that people have in the evening. Sometimes with wine. How's 8:00? Sounds good. Great. [Caroline] Was that Nana's? It's mine. Really? Explain again why, if this isn't a date, why are you trying on multiple outfits? Oh, definitely not. What's wrong with it? It's too "New Year's Eve Bash" not enough "first date romance." You're right. And it's not a date. Mm-hmm. What do you think? [Caroline] It's perfect. For a date! [Holly] That's not how it is. We're just friends. Oh! Who are you kidding, kid sister? It's the holidays and he's alone. So have you invited him home for Christmas? Does Mom know? I haven't, but it's not like she'd mind. Uh, of course not! She would totally love it, especially if he brought dessert. You're getting ahead of yourself. Brad is just being friendly because he doesn't know that many people here. So that's it? You just want to be friends? I'm not sure. He's... ...Very handsome. I was going to say "complex." Okay. Is he a workaholic like Jasper? Jacob. And I think Brad's different. He doesn't work for money or promotion. His work is his passion. Like mine is for me. Wow. Well, for your sake, I hope it is a date. Stop saying that! [laughs] Well, at least we know what's for dessert. The cheesecake! I know what you meant. [snickers] [♪♪♪] Make yourself comfortable, okay? Whatever you're making smells amazing. What is it? Duck confit? C oq au vin ? No such luck. Just roast chicken and roasted root vegetables. Oh, and I made soup. Wanna come try? That's a very simple meal. And I mean that as a compliment. I like simple food. It's all we could afford growing up. You make it sound as though you were poor. Dirt poor, actually. Yeah. But we were happy, for the most part. Home-cooked food-- healthy, made with love. Kind of like Mrs. Rose's. You want a sample? I would love to. Wow. It's amazing. It's my, uh, it's my grandma's country veg. Now, the secret is to sweat the vegetables out, and then you wait until the very end to add the whipping cream, 'cause you don't want it to curdle. It's incredible. Oh, can I serve you a bowl? Yeah. Do you want me to set the table? Yeah, sure. That would be nice. Yeah. That was delicious. I have to admit, I expected something French. Ah, no, just a boy from Fort Myers, Florida who likes to bake. Nothing complicated. But you are complex. You may be right. I'll just take these. [laughing] Oh, ho, ho! That's my grandmother. She raised me on her own. She's the one who passed down her baking passion and skills to me. Like I said, we didn't have a lot of money, growing up, so we made everything ourselves. Preserves, stock, bread. But... that's what made it special. Especially during the holidays, you know, when we'd bake gifts for friends and family and the-- and the church sale. So this is how you became a pastry chef? Yeah, it is. No fancy French school for you? No! No, no, no, no. [laughs] I could not afford college, let alone a ticket to Paris. No, and to be honest, I'm just a baker. You know? The inn owners like to say pastry chef because it's more in keeping with their brand. I'm happiest in the kitchen. It reminds me of family and home. Yeah. That's why I want the bakery, so I can bring the gift my grandmother gave to me to as many people as possible. Well, she taught you well. That's the true me. I've been meaning to thank you. For what? For the egg. The egg you slipped into my gingerbread batter on the first day. And I thought I was so stealthy. Mm, well, it was an honest mistake, forgetting the eggs. And besides, I, uh, I wanted to keep you around. Oh, really? Why? Well, I, uh, I liked our batter banter. Hmm. So, um, what's for dessert? Leftover cheesecake? How did you guess? [♪♪♪] Okay! Everybody, time. Because tomorrow is Christmas Eve, and we're so close to the end of the contest, I thought it would be fun to make today a blind-tasting day. But I thought the blind tasting was for my final decision. Just look at it as a practice run, Carson. It'll be fun! But I-- We'll blindfold Loretta first. And we will give you a taste of each slice, and then you will let us know which one is your favourite-- one, two, or three. [♪♪♪] And here's number three. Okay. Mm! [giggles] Well, seems like we have a tie for second place. Nathalie, Holly, either one of you could be eliminated next. Carson. Okay. You ready? Yes. Number three. And I have some icing, too. [♪♪♪] Okay. I'll go with two as my first choice. That's Brad. The caramel in one was too runny. It ruined the texture of the cake. So I'll go with... three. Nathalie, I'm sorry. [onlookers applauding] Thanks. Thank you, guys. Thanks! [both laugh] You know, if your cake was in the mix, I would've known instantly. We'll see how well you know me come Christmas Eve. I'm ready. It's just the two of us now. I'm so going to kick your butt, Brad Beauchamp. [phone rings] Excuse me. I have to take this, it's work. Yeah, of course. Hello? Holly? You got the job. What? Urban Gourmet, they want to hire you. Oh, my God. That's incredible. Told you, you were a shoo-in. Oh, I'm so happy. Welcome to the team, Holly. I can't wait. Want to know the best part? What? We get to work together full-time, so that's lunch and after-work drinks, five days a week, if you want. Lunch and cocktails, I like the sound of that. After-work drinks, silly. We're both single, the city is ours, and there's plenty of great men to choose from. Are there? Duh! It's New York. All the best men are here. You know that. Oh, I forgot to tell you, you start the day after Christmas. We've got this giant New Year's Eve layout to shoot, but you're a workaholic like me, so you won't mind. Bye. Oh, and Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. [♪♪♪] [all chuckling] I like that. I, uh, I got the job at Urban Gourmet. [gasping] Oh. Well, congratulations, darling. You worked so hard. Yeah, that's awesome. I'm so proud of you. [unconvincingly] It's my, uh, it's my dream job, so. Well, does this mean you're forfeiting, so you can get back to Manhattan? Uh, no way. I can't let Brad win without some friendly competition. [Brad chuckles] I'm happy for you, if it's what you really want. I've wanted to work with this magazine my whole career, and now that it's actually happening, it doesn't quite feel real. Well, in that case, I guess Christmas came early for you. [winds gusting] Oh, this is a surprise. Um, Mrs. Rose, I have to ask you a favor. Can you promise me that Brad will win? Excuse me? Are you asking me to fix the contest? I mean, let's be honest, I'm never going to beat him at baking, but I've gotten to know him better and I can honestly think that your shop couldn't be in better hands. Well, that is high praise from someone who practically grew up inside these walls. I'll see what I can do, but it's gonna ultimately come down to how well Carson knows my cooking. Well, I've tried Brad's baking, and, please, don't be upset, but it is kind of difficult to tell the difference between his and yours. Oh... Well. Carson, then, won't be a factor. [both giggling] Okay, thank you. [background chatter] [bells jingle] -Oh. Hey. -Hey. Uh, what are you doing here? Just getting my morning coffee. Yeah, same. Same. Where's your coffee? I... drank it. I'll see you later. Okay. So... you want me to fix the contest so Holly wins, even though you are the better baker? I just don't think she'll be happy in New York at that job, but she needs a reason to stay in Madison, and I know how much she loves this place. Oh... well, that's very noble of you, Brad. Look, I can be perfectly content baking at the inn, but Holly needs this. Look, if her baking isn't as good as it needs to be, you know, just switch mine in for hers, okay? No one has to know. -Mm. -Please? I'll see what I can do. -Okay. -Mm. -Thank you. -Uh-huh. Did you get that? That is so romantic. [laughs] I always say, Christmas is the most romantic time of the year. Speaking of that... I've been practicing the recipe you gave me. And? I think I'm good enough now. [squealing] Oh! [laughs with delight] Oh! I am so proud of you. Thank you. ♪ Oh! ♪ ♪ Oh... ♪ ♪ Christmas Oh... ♪ [knocking] -Hey. -Hey! Loretta. Everything okay? Is it my mom? No, she's great. Um, I wanted to give you something. Something I made. This isn't a 12th Day of Christmas Panettone? It's better. Did my mom give this to you? She gave me the recipe. I knew it was your favorite, so I wanted to learn. Baked it myself. Try it. It's just like my mom makes. -Really? -Really. [laughs] I don't know what to say. No one other than my mom has ever made me anything. Your mom seems happy. About the contest, I mean. Yeah, I have to admit, it's been fun to watch. Especially seeing what's been developing between Holly and Brad. I think they're falling in love. You know, now that you mention it, they do laugh and talk a lot more than they did. If it's meant to be, they'll definitely fall in love. Ah, I should get going. I gotta get things ready for the final bake-off tonight, and that storm is brutal. Yeah, Mom's boyfriend is supposed to come tonight. I hope he makes it through the storm okay. Me too. I'll, uh, see you at the judging table later. Yeah. I'm so worried that Christian isn't gonna make it through this storm. He'll be here. [sighs anxiously] Okay. Ladies and gentlemen, Holly and Brad, welcome to the final bake-off. So... it's Christmas Eve and it is only fitting that the final recipe be one of tradition, a classic-- my First Day of Christmas iced sugar cookie. [all gasping] Oh! Often, the simplest things in life are the things that make you the happiest, but simple isn't easy, which is what makes life even sweeter. Let the bake-off begin! [Brad] You got this. [♪♪♪] Looking good. [smack] Let's get those cookies in the oven! -Good luck! -Good luck! Oh! What happened? I think the power's out. Yeah, it must be the snowstorm. It probably knocked out the electricity on the whole block. I don't think we can finish as we planned. Well, can we freeze the dough? Well, don't you have to be in New York day after tomorrow? No. We should finish tonight. [Holly] How? We could go to the bakery. They have a generator. That's a great idea. Let's go! -Let's do it. -Okay. [♪♪♪] That's enough! Holly, Brad, time is up. May the best baker win. I think she will. [♪♪♪] [gasping] Oh! Christian! Everybody, this is Christian, my beau from the far north. Hello, everyone. You know, it's quite a storm out there, but I wasn't gonna let any snow stop me from seeing my love on Christmas. Oh, baby! [crowd chuckling] Well, now that we're all here... As you all know, my mom and Christian devised this contest as a way to find someone who loved Christmas baking as much as she did. Now, I was skeptical, and gave myself final veto to ensure that only someone who baked exactly like my mom would own the bakeshop... Over the past several days, I realized that... the bakery isn't just mine or my mother's. It belongs to everyone in Madison. This is the lease, and I'm prepared to sign it over tonight, even if the final winner can't match my mom, because what I've come to understand is... No one can replace her. [gasps] Oh... [crowd applauding] Well... it's time for the final tasting. [♪♪♪] Mm... That would make Santa linger all night. [laughter and applause] [♪♪♪] Equally delicious. [crowd chuckles and applauds] Wow. Okay, Carson, let's discuss. Ahem. [♪♪♪] [chuckles] Well... we've decided that the only fair thing to do is to declare... a tie! [gasping and applauding] Holly, Brad... you both win the bakery, but there is one stipulation... and that is to run it together. I'm willing to try, if you are. Definitely. Well, Carson, let's get these two newly-minted bakeshop owners to sign those papers, make it official. Does this mean I get to keep my job? Of course! You're as much a part of the team as we are. And you too, Carson. Me? [Brad] Yeah, we'll need a financial planner to help us with the books. We're just bakers, after all. [laughter and applause] One sec, one sec. I'll be right back. [Holly laughs] Are you ready to do this crazy adventure? Absolutely. After all, it is Christmas. A sweet Christmas, at that. [♪♪♪] You know, we make a good team. You bake, I decorate. Together, we are... Magic. But we do have a big decision to make. What's that? Well, I know Mrs. Rose's is a local legend, but, you know, we should probably come up with a name of our own. What did you have in mind? I was thinking, uh... Brad Beauchamp's Bakery. What about Holly's Home Bakery? [grumbles] I don't know. [both laughing] Who are we kidding? It will always be Mrs. Rose's Bakery. Mm-hmm. Something else we agree on. Our first customer. She looks like a tough one to please. [door bells jingle] Hi there. Hi... Hi. Hi there. You're not Santa. Are you sure? Which one would you like? How much for that one? It's on us. Good choice. Santa's favorite. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas.
