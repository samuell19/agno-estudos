How'd your area sweep go today, Gabe? You limp-dick motherfucker. Did you drive anything outta that bush? Ah, shit. Who's got the radio tonight? All right, fine. I got it. I got it, I got it. Thanks, babe. All right, guys, I think it's tied to tuck in. Hey, David, enjoy that overnight duty, you know? Hey, would you mind covering for him for like 20 minutes? 30 minutes. Yeah okay, sure, that's fine. 30 minutes? Take your time. I love you, David. I love you so much. Call me Andrew. Andrew? Yeah. Oh. You like that, Andy, huh? You like it when I call you Andrew? I love it. He's getting more stubborn, isn't he? Yeah. It's nice, isn't it? It's almost like the old days, huh? Yeah, I was starting to forget. We need to make a run. I know. Afternoon, Miss. Can you take the sunglasses off please? Is this an official Volunteers checkpoint? It is. Papers, ma'am. Got a haircut recently. Neck check. Miss. Need another minute? Am I sensing a little attitude, Miss? She's clean. You're good to go. Enjoy your day. Attention, all goods must be purchased with a valid business card. Cash will no longer be accepted. You know, you'd look a lot prettier with no teeth, motherfucker. No. No, no, no, no. Blow his fucking cock off. That's every faggot's worst nightmare. Stop. Well. Come on, we're having fun. You're pretty easy. What are you doing near the no-fly zone, you little fucker? Don't worry, it's about to hit the perimeter. Look. Help. - What? - What? I got somebody in the back. Need to get him inside. What? He's hurt. Zabi, open the door. Yeah, yeah. You got him? Yeah. Grab him there. Try to hold on to the wound. I got it. Try to hold onto that. I got his legs. I got his legs. - Okay. - Okay. Shit. What happened? Do you know? Easy. Easy. All right. What the fuck is going on? Who the fuck is that? Okay. Zabi, come here, come here. Right here. Hold just like that. I'm gonna go get my stuff. Oh god. Don't look at it. Just keep the pressure on. David, hurry up. Oh my god, Sarah, what the hell happened to your head? I'm fine, just go move the truck. Move the truck? What the fuck are you talking about? Who the fuck is that? Okay, okay, you ready? Thank you. Is he gonna be okay? I don't know. I have to look at these wounds. Zabi. Go move the truck, we might have company. Company? Sarah, what's the hell did you do? They are gonna kill us. Stop. Just say it was my fault. It is your fault. Oh, it's David, I have to get this. Zahabiya, hurry up. Just, cover for me. Hey, babe. Hey. Everything okay? I have to work a double... It's not safe anymore. We have to get Zabi - out of here. - I know. David's right. We have a very small window before those Volunteers you fucking shot are found. Now is the time to move. They could've been found already. They could have sent scanners out to cover every square inch of this place, setting up roadblocks on every route out of here. We need to leave. - No, we stick to the plan. - We stay with the radio. Because it has done what for us, exactly? We could hear from them any day now. Yeah, or it could be another month. Do you really wanna do this for another month? We don't have a choice. What about the dog, huh? How long do you think you can keep that fucking charade up? Just feeding him for weeks on end... We're here because you trust me, right? - Yes, of course I trust. - Right? Yes. That means we stay put. We are on lock down, which means no more fishing, no more praying on the porch, no more runs, no more smoke breaks. We have been way too casual. We need to stick to the routine. I am the only one who has done this. So I need you to trust me. This will work. We just have to stick to the plan. What are we going to do about the barcode on our couch? You always do this. You care way too much about other people. You need to protect us and our friends. Jay you're hurting my head. You don't even know him. I know he's branded. Just like Zabi. What's one more person on this last run? It's just one more. Sarah. Stop. You can't save everybody. I can try. I need to take a shower. We had a no-show for the 3:45 slot. Just got the go-ahead to send the authorities to that address. Come on, dude. It's all right. Stand up. Come with me. I'm gonna go feed the dog. I'll be right back to relieve you. Okay, just be quick about it before I nod off again. Hi. You're up. Hey. How are you feeling? I feel okay. You hungry? Want some coffee? Coffee would be great, actually. Okay. - I'm Zahabiya. - Did you sleep well? Yeah, I did, really well. Oddly enough. That's good. I'll see you in a little bit. Here you go. Uh, we don't have any sugar or milk, actually. Sorry. It's fine. So uh, you're feeling a little bit better. That's really good. Thanks to you, I guess. Are you in an EMT or doctor or something? Or, you were? I, I was a nurse. I was studying to get my MD when everything fell apart. Well, either way, could've fooled me. Mm, here, here, here. Easy. Victims' bodies have been located, and Volunteers' families are being notified. Continuing to collect evidence from the scene. Potential ID of suspect is being circulated. I appreciate you all helping me. I'll be outta your space as soon as I can. I'm sorry for being such a burden. You're not a burden. So, this is our radio. We're waiting on coordinates from my contacts in Canada. They're all working to find us a safe crossing point to get over the border. Those coordinates will only come through this. So this radio is our lifeline. I've done this before with a few other groups, but this time we're all going, to get out for good. We man the radio in shifts, all day, all night. So there's never a moment when someone isn't listening to it. We could get noticed at any moment, any day now. You wanna get the fuck outta this country? Obviously a lot of controversy around the Volunteers. Uh, you know, today's your opportunity to try to explain to our viewers what you guys represent? Well, I mean, this is a group of concerned citizens who all agree the key to a healthy society starts at home. You know, in your neighborhood, in your communities, and illegals are still pouring in with their drugs and their bombs and their, their trucks used - as battering rams... - TV off. More stringent measures must be taken. What type of measures are you suggesting? Well, we need to start self-policing. We need to know who our neighbors are. We need to protect our children, our culture, our way of life. And eventually, this organization will have a Volunteers group in every major city. Like a, a militia? I mean, it essentially sounds like you're building out a militia. No, I, I wouldn't jump to that. We're just trying to embody the change we wanna see in our communities. You mean maintain the status quo in your communities? It sounds like you don't want change... All right, look, you understood my meaning. You're, you're being pedantic now. Your followers, um, they have a uniform. Uh, the, the orange? This is a uniform? No. And your members consist of predominantly white men. Excuse me, Lori, we encourage anyone who believes in the cause to join. Now, I can't rightly say exactly what the breakdown of our members look like. You know, actually, I can, I have the figures right here. This is yeah, actually can, can we just put this on screen for our viewers? As you can see, 89% of your group polled identified as avid gun rights activists. Yeah. I've seen the uh, so-called report you're talking about. Who uh, did the polling for that, exactly? You know, there actually, there've also been reports of certain Volunteer factions being continuously linked to violent hate crimes? Those reports are false. Completely fabricated. Do you have any comments on these numbers? I don't. They are fake. I think, You know I, I think, respectfully, I think we're done talking here. Did you decide on a name yet? I've always liked the name Isko. Isko? Mm-hmm. I don't know. You kinda seem like a Justin to me. Oh, no. Ew, gross. That is like the least Filipino name I've heard. Other than like, Brett. Who cares? You can be whatever you wanna be. I do. Don't whitewash me, girlfriend. I care. Okay. Okay. Um, and you studied to be an architect. Mm-hmm. But now you work as a? As a uh, project manager at a queer non-profit organization that houses homeless, LGBT kids. Uh wow, okay. That is incredibly specific. It is. And then, you know, we have to figure out the basic stuff. You know, birthday, address, social insurance number, shit like that. Fine. But I'm sticking with Isko. Uh, hey, you should probably stay off your feet. No, I've been laying down for like two days. I need to move. My ass is killing me. What is going on here? Who are these guys? Can't sleep either, huh? Babe. Yeah, I told him he should be asleep. Yeah, you, you should be asleep too. Quiet shift? Yeah, as always. Well, up early. Might as well feed the dog. Oh, you guys have a dog? Oh, I love dogs. If you're staying here, you should probably learn how to do this too. Stay close. Watch your head. What about my water? Take one of those water bottles. Roll it across the floor to him. Who's this faggot? If you want your waste bucket emptied this week, you won't use that language. We had everything lined up. The safe house, the supply chain, but the location was compromised when we arrived. Sarah thought fast. We ended up here at his house. I don't understand. A Volunteer's property's a no-fly zone. They get to keep their freedom of privacy as upstanding Americans for their dedicated service. Hey, I'm sorry. And you said, this is his house? Yeah, we're hiding in plain sight. Oh my god. I don't know how you haven't strangled that guy yet. I wouldn't be able to help myself. We're not gonna hurt him, we just, we need him right now. When we leave, we'll let him go. - I said lockdown, goddammit. - Get your asses inside. You want me to do the check-in? No, I got it. Gabe, check in. Gabe, you limp-dick motherfucker, where the fuck are you? Check in. Tag me in. Kept the seat warm for ya. Thanks. Take a load off. We'll be here a while. How you feeling, babe? Like I got pistol whipped in the back of the head. Did you have David take another look at you? Yeah, he says I probably have a brain hemorrhage. That's not funny. You know, we still haven't unload the supplies from the truck, including the ibuprofen you clearly need Sarah bear. We shouldn't risk it. It's been nearly two days. We haven't heard peep on the radio. We need those supplies... - Jay. - And I need my hot sauce. Please, you're hurting the head, again. I'm going. Feeding an extra mouth is a burden that we do not need. You are so paranoid. I am not paranoid, I'm cautious. You always get like this with new people. No, I don't. Yes you do. You get closed off and paranoid and grumpy. He is not a new person, David, he's a total stranger. He's branded, and we are trying to get out just like him. I'm just saying, be cautious with the guy, all right? Stop being all chummy and shit. This plan is complicated enough as it is without having some unvetted gay guy piggybacking his way across the border on our dime. Jesus, now you sound like them. Ah, shut up. Just be nice. Okay. We already gave him the option to come with us. And, Sarah trusts him. So, that should be all that you need to know. I love you to death, David, but you're wrong here. He could be a liability. Welp, at least Sarah got booze. - Pick your... - Wanna play spades. Spades. So, there's your cards. Um, spades are trump. You have to follow suit. So if someone plays a heart, you play heart. If someone plays a diamond, you play diamond. You're in teams. So it's you and Jarret versus... And we're gonna kill it, - 'cause I have a great hand. - Me and Zabi. That's not true. Zabi is one of the great card sharks of all time. Didn't know that, did you? If someone plays a heart, you gotta play a heart, if it's diamonds, let's just play. Just play, and we'll tell you when you fucked it up. All right, starting off. Here we go. Three of clubs. - Wow, that's powerful. - A powerful first move. I hope everyone's paying attention. Okay, kid's got moves. Dance that pain away, boy. Go, go, go, go. - Go, go, go, go. - Yes. Oh. You okay? Huh? What're you doing? lt's early. Uh, David. It's actually really late. No, it's not late. Just shut up. Arjay, drink, hm? Solemnly swear to always hold hate in my heart for niggers, spics. Well, I think we should all just get some rest. David. Aren't you on radio tonight? Fuck. Um, can I switch with someone? With who? I can take it. No, you can't. I have to train you first. - But, in this place we... - No, no. I can teach him. Okay? You sure? Yeah, why don't you get some rest. Okay. Be nice. Okay. Paranoid grumpy. - Okay. - Yeah? Yeah. Night. Night. Let's go. These are our radios. Our walkie, the CB. The walkie is always on channel three. That's the Volunteer's channel. The CB, you don't fuckin' touch it. You just listen. Every 15 minutes you put an entry in the log. It keeps you alert and shows you're not fucking us all by falling asleep. Got it. Uh, what do I write down, exactly? Whatever you want. Just make sure it keeps you awake. We can't miss this. Once we get those coordinates from Sarah's contacts we have a one hour window to make it to the rendezvous point before the window closes, for good. You understand how important this is? Yeah, of course I understand. If you were to hear something tonight, anything tonight, you write down exactly what you heard, word for word, legible, no mistakes. Okay, so you mean if I hear the coordinates or if I hear the Volunteers again? Once you write it down, you move as fast as you can, and you wake us all up, and we book our asses to the rendezvous. Do you understand all that, bud? Or do you want me to write you a manual? What's your deal? What's yours? I already told you. - Yeah. - Mm-hmm. Yeah, you already told me. You're just some little kid, and you're looking to get out. Aren't we all? I don't care one way or another what your story is, Arjay. But you were never supposed to be a part of mine. So do not fuck this up. Or you can wave goodbye to your free ride across the border. Oh, I thought you forgot about me. What's for dinner? I was gonna give this cigarette to you. Like I promised yesterday. Until you called my new friend a faggot. If you'd like to apologize, I might reconsider. Well, he is, isn't he? A faggot? No, he isn't. He's gay. I'm a Muslim. You're a white Volunteer who wants us dead. No, I don't want you dead, you're a lady. Well, maybe the faggot 'cause he's a dude. I just don't wanna have to look at you. 'Cause I'm a shitskin? Remember when you used to call me that? I never called you that. Yes, you did. You used to call me a shitskin. And you stopped. Why did you stop? I definitely never called you that. You called me a shitskin and you saw how it hurt me, and then you stopped. It was easy to stop, wasn't it? Took a while to get there, but we were making progress. Yeah, we were till that bald bitch came and busted my lip again today. You know, she doesn't have to smash my face in every time she wants me to do a radio check-in. She could just ask me nicely. I'll talk to her about that. It's important we're civil with each other. Civil? What the fuck you talk? I'm chained to a post in my own fucking barn. Shittin' in a bucket! Civil? That fuckin' bald cunt's got some serious rage issues and she's taking it out on me. The way you talk to us, you're not doing yourself any favors. Hey there. Sarah said for you to go to bed. I'm radio-trained now. Are you okay? You ever stop to think about these ideas that you believe and this cause that you're behind, that maybe it's just all wrong? What do you mean? I mean, everything that the Volunteers do and say, how it affects other people. What if it's just wrong? It's not. But, what if? What kind of pain were you going through? When you started believing everything that you believe? I don't, I don't know what you're asking. I'm just asking, when you started feeling this way, what happened to you? I think I don't wanna talk anymore. I don't feel like talking. You gonna give me that cigarette or not? You're a really good dancer, Arjay. Okay. It's like, it's like you don't care what anyone else thinks about you. I don't, or, I try not to at least. I wish I was like that. Hey, what's the matter, David? I'm, I'm really glad you're here. Why do you think it is we can't talk about this? Why do we always get stuck in the same place? There's nothing to figure out. You don't have to figure out my fucking brain. I already told you, I wanna preserve my culture, my way of life, my country. Your existence, people like you, they're actively replacing my entire race. That's just a fact. It's the largest genocide this world has ever seen. You ever stop to think that that's wrong? I just, I'm trying to understand all this rage. Allowing you to exist is a threat to the white race. I hate this fuckin' conversation. 'Cause you're afraid of having it. Shut the fuck up! Shut the fuck up! Do you ever regret it? Regret what? Our stupid tattoo. Are you kidding me, man? Course not. That was an epic night. Oh no, no, no. I'm so fucking stupid. I'm so fucking stupid. It's okay. No, it's not, no. I'm sorry, I'm so, - I'm so sorry. - No, you don't need - to apologize. - I didn't mean to. You're not um,. I'm really fucking drunk right now. And I didn't mean to. I'm, I'm not um... I'll see you tomorrow. Hey. Give the faggot a goodnight kiss for me. It's exhausting. Isn't it? David? David. Hey. Hey. How's it going? He just came down here and fell asleep. Silly boy. I'll take him upstairs. Everything okay with the radio? Yeah, great. Any questions? You'll do great. Hey, come on. Let's go to bed. I'll just sleep here. I just got outta bed. You're okay. You're okay. It's okay. That's it. Oh, easy. Easy. Don't worry man, I got it. Table talking's fine. Just don't play that one. I do. Stop looking at my cards. It's very rude. - Oh. - What're you gonna do? I'm gonna, I'm gonna do this. Hey, buddy. Hi, honey. Come here. Oh, what's going' on, hm? Hm? Could he be any more adorable? - Impossible. - What happened? I fell. You wanna tell me a secret? No. I heard something outside. You heard something? Oh, I'm sorry. Want Daddy to put you back to bed? Need me to investigate? Take care of all the monsters - for you? - Yeah? Should I go check? Yeah? All right, come here, - come here. - Somebody's bed time. You know what though, give your mom a kiss. Give Mommy a kiss. Mwah. - Oh! - Thank you. All right, here we go. You ready? Ooh! Love you. Goodnight. What do you say we have a sleepover, huh? What's going on? Oh god. Sarah. Get him away from the window. It's okay. It's okay. Volunteer number 9947, check in. 9947, I said check in. Jarret, Jarret, wake up. They're talking to us. The Volunteers are asking 9947? Get back to the radio, now. 9947, Rise and shine, buttercup. Jesus Christ, keep it down, asshole. 9947 reporting. Five minutes out, coming in now. Uh, I'm still in my underwear, man. David, Zabi, code red. What's going on? No time to talk, just get downstairs. Let's go. Put your fuckin' skirt on, motherfucker. We're activated. Gonna raise some hell. Fuck yeah, man. I'll be ready. Fuck. Let's go, let's go. Arjay, downstairs, come on. Get in the basement. Let's go. Sarah, should we bring the dog up? - No. Uh, go his room. - Put on his clothes. What? Put on his clothes? Yeah, you just answered as 9947, you need to be him. No, Sarah, fuck that. You get his ass out here and you tell him that we're gonna shoot him if he doesn't make his friends go away. We shoot him or them, we're dead. Sarah, we did not plan for something like this. That's why I am making a plan. They, they, they probably don't know who Volunteer 9947 is or they would've used his name. They, they always do. Probably? Just, we don't have time for this. Please, go put on his clothes. Fuck. Zabi? Give me a hand with this. What is happening? - The Volunteers are coming. - Keep your mouth shut. Sarah, take the walkie. Yeah. Make a pot of coffee, act normal. I'm gonna keep the dog from barking. Sarah, I don't know if this is such a good plan, making coffee. I mean, what am I gonna offer them some? I need the gun. I need it for that piece of in the barn. When then use a fucking knife, I need the gun. Oh my god, okay. Fuck. Help! - Shut the fuck up. - Help! Help! Shut the fuck up. Shut the fuck up right now. Stop screaming. You Victor, 9947? Guilty as charged. Grab your shit. We gotta move fast. Some queer killed two of our brothers not 10 miles down the road. Shut up. Gathering any of us we can along the way, building a little hunting party. Gonna have ourselves a fag drag. Nobody kills two of our men without the hammer coming down. Get in the fucking truck. Yee-haw. Woo, woo, woo. Giddy-up, giddy-up. They're gonna fuckin' kill him. He's smart. He'll figure it out. Sarah, what do we do? We're gonna go after him, right? Why didn't anyone plug this back in? Sarah? Sarah, he needs us. We have to go after him. He's doing what he needs to do, and he always comes back to me. Isn't this time a little fucking different? We stay on task, we stay on routine. That's all that matters. Who cares about that fucking radio? They could've called when it was unplugged. Fuck the radio. They're gonna kill him! Stop being emotional, I'm trying to focus. What did you do to him? I kept him quiet. What are you doing? Arjay, get outta the way. No, I know Jarret is your friend and you love him, but you can't go after him alone. Don't be stupid. I'm gonna keep my distance. I just need to see that he's okay. So, move. Get out. No, it's not safe. You're not thinking clearly, David. It is safe. It is safe for me, it is safe. I'm not branded, unlike you. We're not that different. Yeah, except that I can pass and you can't. So get the fuck outta the truck. I understand being emotional and making stupid decisions, okay? It's been my entire life. But what you're about to do is gonna get you both killed. I know how much you care about him, but you're not leaving. I won't let you. Why are you doing this to me? I know how you feel. Shut up. You don't understand how I feel. Yes. You do not know how I feel. - I do know. - You don't know how I feel. You don't... David, I understand exactly how you feel. Okay? I'm, I'm sorry. Hey. lt's okay. David. That's not what I came here for. Sorry. Well fuck it then, you're gonna come with me. No, David, David. It's okay. I know if I apologize, it won't mean anything to you, but it doesn't change the fact that I'm sorry that happened. It won't happen again. I won't let it. You're outta your mind if you think anything you say to baldy's gonna have an effect. Is there anything I can do to show you I truly am sorry? To make you trust me again? No. Never seen this photo. You have a beautiful family. I'm gonna leave this here. I'll see you for dinner? I just want a beer. Get me a beer, I'll forget your friend's a cunt. Any Volunteers in the area come down to the quarry. We got some snowflakes to melt. Fuck you, you bastards! Fuck. Okay, it's a big day, Reese. You should cover up. I don't like that he's down there alone. Arjay can handle it. He can also handle David, apparently. I'm glad he knocked some sense into you. If you push it like that again, I'm gonna to lock you - in the fucking barn. - Okay. You could've blown the whole operation. Okay, okay. I get it. Fuck. Arjay. Absolutely quiet. We have a serious problem. Jesus, this is insane. Well David, I think what is insane is staying some place where people might attack you if you're holding Zabi's hand. You are being paranoid, man. There's no way that this can get any worse. Somebody, someone will do something. David, they're branding people now. The group that Sarah has with her right now, they have them. Just think about it, okay? Really think about it. How'd you know my brand? Got it from your pantry. Ah, of course you did. Ah. David says you've been on the radio most of the day, you should take a break. Why don't you tell me what happened to you out there, and I'll tell you if I wanna take a break. They've gotten bigger. They're growing. They're more organized. And? And we need to move right now. Bad idea. Sarah. It's been months. This operation has dried up. We are waiting on a ghost. We promised David and Zabi that we would get them across and that is what we're going to do. We were positioned as outpost for nearly three weeks. Just watching one road out of the mountains for Taliban fighters. During the day it was burning fucking hot. It was freezing cold at night. I mean, it just sucked. 24/7 eyes on the same stupid fucking road. Sounds pretty boring. Yeah, it was more boring than you could imagine. I had no idea you served. Two tours. Thank you. For what? Serving. Wanting to help the world. I had to feed wife and kids somehow. I don't know that I helped all that much. You must have. Thank you for your service. Well, it's been a long time since anybody said that. You remember when we used to thank the troops for the service? People even had stickers and shit. Yeah, I remember. Feels like a long time ago now. Something tells me you never had a bumper sticker. Ah, well. Didn't get much thanks from ole Uncle Sam either. What was it like when you came back? Couldn't sleep. Couldn't find work. Couldn't get treatment. Couldn't talk to my wife, it was fuckin' great. Where is she now? I don't know. Took off with the kids. You know, probably couldn't put up with me anymore. I don't blame her. I'm sorry. Well, shit happens. You got another one? So all it took you to chill out was a couple beers? Should've asked for one a month ago. Yeah, well baldy would've just cracked it over my fucking skull. Please. Please. We can go home. We can go home and start over, you and me. No, we can't. You signed up for this. You knew what we were getting into. I'm scared. Okay, Sarah? I'm really scared and I want to go home. I know, we all are. But you cannot let them see that. You have to stay strong for them. We need to put our family first. We don't have a family anymore. We can start a new one. We already did. They're upstairs. Why did you join? What, the army? No, the Volunteers. Was it after your wife left? Well, it's, it's okay if you don't, if you don't wanna talk about it. No, it's okay. Yeah. It was after they left. Because you were lonely? Yeah, I guess I uh, was a little lonely, yeah. And you wanted to protect your country? Like you had done before. Yeah. From who? People like you. People like me? Well, not you, exactly. What sort of people then? Well just, you know, uh, Muslims, foreigners, illegals types of people. But I'm a Muslim. Yeah. Well, yeah. I wanna protect it from people like you then. Just people that don't belong here. But I was born here. Well I said, not you, exactly. But people like you. So if protecting your country, your culture, from people like me means tracking me everywhere I go and locking me up, would you do that to me? Can we go back to just talking? We are talking. Well fuck, let's talk about something else. It's killing my buzz. Okay. Am I the first Muslim you've ever met? Course not, I served in Afghanistan. But am I the first Muslim you've ever really, really talked to? You kiddin' me? I trained Ana recruits outside the wire for weeks on end. I was with 'em every single day. I, I turned 'em into soldiers. So you must have gotten close with some of them? Yeah. Yeah, sure but, some of 'em were pretty cool guys, definitely. Yeah but, good guys or not, I had to watch my back. Do you want me dead, Gabe? No, I don't. Of course I don't. 'Cause those Volunteers that showed up today, I'm certain, if they had found me, they would've killed me. You heard 'em, didn't you? I heard 'em. You don't seem like one of them. Yeah well, I'm not. Most of those guys are just a bunch of assholes playing dress up. Never served, never did much of anything. I don't, I don't care for most of 'em, to be honest with you. But you see what they're doing, the people they're hurting. Those people, they're like me. No, I never hurt anybody. But people are hurting now. People are dying, now. Now. I never thought it would turn into what it did. Neither did I. I'll tell you one thing, when I joined, I definitely didn't see myself hanging out in my barn with you. I never thought I'd be complicit in locking you up in your barn. Never thought I'd have a conversation like this with a Volunteer. And I never thought I'd share a beer with a Muslim. I never, I never thought I'd have to leave my home. I never thought that. I would see my family blown apart because a Volunteer placed a bomb in our mosque. I didn't know that happened to you. It did. I'm sorry it did. Don't you wish that this would all just go away? I mean, wouldn't that be nice? Yeah, it would. I don't think it's too late. I'll drink to that. Yeah, I'm gonna put these in the fridge next time. Are you even supposed to be drinking? No. Goes against my beliefs. Fuck yeah. Finish it off. I'll see you tomorrow. I was about to go do a safety check, you've been gone for so long. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. Have you been drinking? Uh, had a couple beers, yeah. You drank with him? With the dog? We're not gonna call him that anymore. From now on we use his name, Gabe. No, we don't. I don't wanna use his name. Why would I wanna use his name? What exactly is going on? What are you doing with him, Zabi? Talking. I'm trying to understand. What? What are you trying to understand? Why he's such a piece of shit to us? He's ignorant and angry, but he's not entirely bad. He's still a, a person, David. No Zabia, no. He's trying to get into your head. He's totally playing you. You know that I'm right. I don't think you are. I'm sorry that it makes you angry, but I don't. Yeah it, it does make me angry. That you are out there in that barn hour after hour. What are you trying to do, convert him? You can't. There's no middle ground with the Volunteers. They see black and they see white. You're wrong. I talked to him tonight about my family, and he said he was sorry. It wasn't an act. He wasn't pretending. Oh, don't be stupid, please. He just wants to get outta that barn. He's not different than us, he's just on the other side. If I could change his mind. - If I could change... - You can't, you can't... - One person's mind... - Change his mind. - Then maybe more people... - Just stop it, all right? Stop trying to find his humanity. He doesn't have any. I have more reason to hate him than you do. My family was slaughtered. David, slaughtered, my entire family. Our family. Yeah but I can't bring myself to hate him. I need to convince myself that the world isn't shit, that there's still good people in it. Because if I, if I don't believe that then what is the point of being part of it? Tell me. Just... David, I hope this correspondence finds you well. I'm pleased to inform you that according to this year's census, you're eligible to have your student loan debt entirely abolished in exchange for a one-time donation to my election campaign. Hey, hey, it's okay. Jarret. Come with me. Don't talk. Okay? Come on. Ah! Jarret, are you gonna tell me what happened yesterday? Or you just gonna float there? You should come in. lt's nice. I'm cold. Are you not cold? It's freezing. But it's nice. I gotta cleanse my eyeballs. What happened today, it was a mistake. I stopped you from leaving, that's all. You, and your secrets. I don't want any part of it. Whoa. Did you get your tattoo removed? Uh, yeah. Couple a years ago. Uh, ouch. I'm not sure if I should be offended or not. Why the hell did you do that? Well uh, it just always made me think too much about that day. The day that we, when we found 'em. Yeah, so? So I always hated myself when I thought about it. Ouch man, now I'm actually offended. Why would you hate yourself for something we did when we were drunk and stupid teenagers? Do you ever think about that night? I remember it, if that's what you mean. What do you remember about it? Why would you get it removed? That shit doesn't work, man. I can still see it there. What do you remember about that night? Tell me. Remember the same thing that you remember. Tell me. Tell you what? You can't even fucking say it. David. I remember, David, okay? I remember, you remember. Do you want me to say it? Would it make you feel better if I said it? I remember. Is that what this is about? You hear something? - Don't make a sound. - It won't see you. Every time I look at that tattoo, I would think of that night. And I would think about how it ended, and wonder why it made me feel so bad. And then the Volunteer shit started happening and I was, and I was, I was scared and I just wanted those feelings to go away. So I, I fucking got it removed. David. David, hey. Not that it helped. Hey, Dave. I love you. But you are in your head. We were just kids. And nobody blamed you for hiding that part of yourself when our country started falling apart. But I am really not the one that you gotta talk to about this. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know. I'm scared. I know. I don't want her to think less of me. David, hey, hey. Hey. I am so fuckin' sorry that this whole thing is such a mess but we are going to get out of here. I swear, okay? We're gonna leave tonight. Okay? As soon as the sun goes down. We're not gonna wait on coordinates anymore, all right? Okay. Okay? We need to ditch Arjay. We need to put the dog down. And I need you, David, okay, I need you to stop crying and help me, okay? Help me, please, convince Zabi and Sarah it's time to go. Okay? - Come on. - Okay. Come on. Get in, get in. Come here. It's okay, it's okay, it's okay. It's okay, it's okay. It's okay. Zabi. Hey. You stop feeding that piece of shit. Where were you guys? What's going on? We're leaving, tonight. Now I know you don't wanna do this, but we all have to do things that we don't wanna do. So you're gonna go in there and take care of your pet project. Put a bullet in his fucking head, and meet us inside for a group meeting. You got it? David. David, come on! David! You heard that. I'm sorry, I, I don't know that I can protect you. I can help you. I, I trust you. Hey. Zabi if you trust me too, I can help you. I can, I can show you across the border. If you, if you let me go, I can show you across the border. I, I know how to get there. I'm sorry. They'll never believe that. Jarret will never believe that. You still have to try. I wanna see my family again. If you don't, he's gonna kill me. There is a simple way not to fuck this up and that is to stay put. Why do we have to keep having the same conversation over and over again? This is not like your other runs. This time, it's different. How? Things have changed. These aren't just groups of fucking zeros going out, looking for a good time, calling in a couple of illegals. These are organized hunters with assault rifles out for blood. Yeah well, things have been escalating for months. We found a group of people yesterday trying to cross. They brought them to a field. And they beat them to death. They tied them with chains to their trucks, to drag them around this field for hours. They lit their bodies on fire. Sarah, they lit their bodies on fire. So you're proving my fucking point. We just can't, we can't go running out there like idiots. I had to kick. I had to kick a woman's face in and I had to like it, Sarah. I had to like it. I need, we need to leave tonight and that is goddamn fucking final. Okay. Okay. Let's just calm down a second, okay? We're all gonna figure this out together as a group. Now just listen. And I know you're not gonna like this, Jared, but Gabe, the Volunteer, he wants to help us. Don't even get me started. And you? You need to leave. David and I have talked, and you're a liability. Jarret says that there are photos of you all over town. From where? A checkpoint? I don't know, but you have to leave, Arjay. I'm sorry. He is a leech. We are not getting rid of anyone. Yeah, apparently not. We can't even get rid of the fucking asshole at the barn because he's become your buddy. Jarret! Zabi, who's on? No one's on the radio. Sarah. Sarah, nobody is coming to save us. Nobody. Can you just wake up? Jarret. Fuck it. Jarret, you wanna plan, I have one. Gabe knows how to get us across the border safely. He's willing to show us in exchange for letting him go, unharmed, which is what we were planning, right? That was the original plan. He wants to help us. This might be our best chance. You can come with us tonight or you can stay and you can wait to be dragged out by a fuckin' chain. Is that what you think of me too? That I'm a leech. No, Arjay, of course not. Everything was fine before you showed up. I don't think that's true. But you know what? You tell yourself what you need to in order to survive this. Arjay. Wait. Arjay. - I'm not going back. - Please, don't ask. Okay but, where are you going to go? What are you going to do? You don't have to leave. You're part of our family now. Our fucked up little family. Please, Zahabiya. I don't wanna cause anymore trouble. I should've never stayed in the first place. Please let go of me. I want you to stay, Arjay. I don't deserve your help. Of course you do. I've been nothing but trouble to you and your friends. Just let me go. No, I won't. I can't let you leave like this. Stay. You're the only one here who really knows what I'm going through. David and I... David and you what? There are things that you do not know. They wouldn't listen. I don't think there's any convincing them. They don't trust you. Well you can. You can trust me. I hope so. I'm going to uncuff you, Gabe. And I'm asking you to stay put. Don't run for the hills the second my back is turned. Don't storm the house and catch us off guard. If I come back with the group and you're still here waiting they'll know that they can trust you. I'll know that I can trust you. I really hope this isn't the last time I see you. Arjay's gone. Good. He doesn't wanna cause any more trouble. I'm guessing you didn't kill the Volunteer? Are you kidding me? Of course not. Well then, what are we gonna do, Zabi? We can't let him go tonight when we leave. He'll just round up the troops and hunt us all down. He won't. I trust him. Look, come with me, I'll show you. He's not the person that you think he is. Someone has gotta take care of this. We have to cover our tracks. Can you even see how this looks right now, David? You're holding a gun, and talking about killing someone. It's seriously like I don't even know you. Yeah well, it has to be done. So I don't know what to tell you. Go get Jarret. Tell him to do it. Sarah. I've packed all of your things. I would like you to come upstairs. I don't know how to do this without you. I don't know how to do anything without you. We've helped so many people. The one time I try to do it with the people I love the most it all gets fucked. I know. But I need your help. David and Zabi feel safest when you are leading us. Arjay told me about what happened. Is it true? Is this the first time? You, you've always felt this way? Why? Why have you never talked to me about this? I could've, I would've understood, I, I would have. You can't understood. I'm branded, David. Branded. I got marked while you hid. You could've had the, you didn't, you didn't even have the courage to be yourself let alone talk to me about this. And meanwhile, we could have been going through all of this together. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. There should've been two letters on our door. I went through all of this alone! You could have been honest me. You don't understand. You didn't give me a chance to. I've always been alone with this. You didn't have to be. You made that choice. I didn't have to self-report, send in my census form. I could've hid, stopped going to mosque, avoid my family. But I, I know who I am. And even though it's been terrifying, even though it has put me through hell, if I, if I could go back, I would still self-report because I am proud of who I am. I'm gonna unplug the radio. - Don't you fucking dare. - Sarah. Let me do this. All you have to do is come with me and we can have the life we had before... - No, don't touch it. - I promise we can start again. We can build a new family, Sarah. I don't want to replace him. Okay? I don't. I'm gonna unplug it right now. - No. No. - Sarah, we need to let go. We have to move on! Oh my god. Oh my god, oh my god. Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god. Baby, okay baby, calm down, okay? You're making yourself sick, calm down. I've always known that you were different. That's why I fell in love with you. But, now... Everybody help! I need to get Sarah and Jarret and we need to meet at the barn now. David, David, do you hear me? David, look at me, look at me. Look at me! All right. I'm sorry. I know that you're in pain. But that man in the barn, he's in pain too. And I trust him. He has been open and honest with me and he is our way out of here. I will always love you. Always. But we have to start over and to do that we need to get out of here, now. Help! Help! It's okay, okay? lt's okay. It's okay. - It's okay. - What's happening? I don't know. I don't know, she just started bleeding. - What did you do? - I don't know, I don't know. - Honey. - I don't know. - I don't know. I don't know. - Okay, hey, look at me. Sarah, we're gonna get you cleaned up, and get us out of here, all right? We've got to wait, just wait. We can't give up now. Sarah, Sarah, it's okay, it's okay. Look at me. Look at me, keep your eyes open. You've given us everything we need, okay? We're gonna help you. You don't need to worry anymore. I've got you, I've got you. It's okay, it's okay. David. I got her, I got her, I got her. Here, I got her, I got her. Be careful. I'll be right behind you. David. No. David, why don't you give me the gun? It's over. Okay? lt's over. Just give me the gun. No! Okay, okay, come out here. Time to go. No, I can't go. We're gonna go, come on. Come on. - Oh god. - Volunteer 9947, check in. Volunteer 9947, scanner just picked up multiple shots in your zone. Multiple shots fired in your zone. Volunteer 9947, check in. Multiple shots fired in your zone. Copy. Sarah. Sarah! Oh my god. Oh my god, I told you not to move, baby. How did you get up the stairs? There is no baby. He's gone. I know. I know. Volunteer 9947, gunshots in your zone. Repeat, multiple shots fired in your zone. Copy. My head hurts so much and I don't know what to do. It's okay. I promise you we're gonna fix it and we'll make it stop hurting, okay? I promise. All units to zone 10. All available units to zone 10. Volunteer 9947, check in. No. Volunteer 9947, I heard 'em too. I'm gearing up and ready to go. - Copy. - No, Jarr. Yes, yes. I'm gonna buy you some time, okay? Now you and Zabi, you're gonna get to the truck, and you're gonna drive to the border, and you're gonna cross. You're gonna find one of the spots that you've crossed before 'cause I know you can do it. You remember. You remember. What about David? David is Gone. He's gone. But you two are gonna get outta here, okay? You just gotta go now. - No, no. - Yes. I'm gonna find you. - No. - I'm gonna find you. - I promise, I'll find you. - No. I'm gonna find you. Zabi, Zabi, hey, look at me. You gotta take care of her. You gotta take care of her. You do not come back here. Okay. Sarah, let's go. Please come. - I love you, okay? - I love you, okay? You just gotta go. You gotta go now. Okay. Hey, 9947. 4464, good to meet you, brother. Nice to meet you. I'm Dee, 23487. Hi. Hey, sorry to bug you guys, but uh, I'm gonna sweep the area, all right? It's not a disturbance at all. I mean, I just, I just appreciate you guys checking in. Step on inside, I'll, I'll get my gear. - Hey. - Yeah? You said you heard shots, right? Yeah. I, I definitely heard 'em. Well, what direction did they sound like they were coming from? Uh, I, I couldn't rightly say. I mean, I had the game on pretty loud. Sarah. We know they came from zone 10, right? Very few residences around here. Shouldn't take long to find 'em. Do you mind if uh, for safety sake, if we take a look around? I, I don't mind at all. I mean, as long as you don't mind my dirty undies laying about. Hey, hey, hey, uh, weren't you with us yesterday? Sarah. Come on. I know you, you busted that one bitch's teeth, clean outta her head. Yeah. Fuckin' miss out on all the fun. Sarah, we have to run, okay? I can't do it. You can do it, you can do it, you can do it. I need help. Okay. Ready? One, two, three. Finished sweeping the property. We didn't find anything. All right, let's start a larger sweep of the area. Check the woods at the perimeter. Hey 9947, what you got in that barn? I mean, to be honest fellas, it's been a long time since I've been in there. You know, the usual stuff, tractor, small propane tanks, you know. What the fuck is that? They found Gabe, and David. Sarah, we gotta go. No, Jarret. Come on. What's going on? Why are we slowing down? There's a checkpoint ahead. We might be fucked. Holy shit. What? They have Arjay. Tied up on the side of the road just to our right. Evening, miss, can I see your papers? Oh, of course. I heard the siren. Is everything all right? Everything's fine. Your papers. Wait here a minute. Give me the gun. When you see your moment, grab Arjay and get the fuck outta here. Looks like we got a problem here, Miss Sarah. It says here you're female, Caucasian. I'll need you to turn around so I can see... Don't come any closer motherfuckers or I'll blow his head off. She's armed. Billy, keep an eye on that bitch in the truck. All right, just settle. We need to get more men in the area. Let him go. Or what? Can I tell you the truth? Can I? Don't move a muscle, bitch. What're you lookin' at? Keep your eyes down. - Get to the truck. - All right. This is your last chance. Let him go. I shot those little bitches... I said don't look at me. Where's everyone else? They're coming later. They'll be right behind us. How will they find us? They just will. They, they'll cross too and, we'll find each other. How? So, you were saying, native New Yorker? Mm-hmm. Native New Yorker. Brothers and sisters? Three brothers. Three brothers. And uh, where do you fall in the line? Yeah, last. - The baby. - Yeah. I'm glad I waited that whole extra 20 minutes for you. Dude, it was the MTA. You're really not gonna ever let this go, are you? If you had been ghosted as many times as I have, you wouldn't let it go either. I don't think you wanna compare statistics in that area, buddy. Oh yeah? Try me. Let's say, I've been on more dates that didn't show up than did. Uh, it's just, I'm usually always wearing this. So, on a first date, I don't know. I'd love to ask the real assholes why they didn't show up, but I, I have my theories. I'm sorry, I don't understand. I'm Muslim. This is a hijab. Got it. Uh, sorry, I'm an idiot. No. Thank you for telling me that. And I'm sorry, I still don't understand. You didn't wear this on our first date because? Um I, I don't know. It's kind of hard to talk about. I guess I, I haven't really felt very safe recently with everything that's been going on. So, you were a stranger. On our first date, I was nervous. I, I didn't know what I was walking into. You could've been a Volunteer for all I knew. What? Do I look like a volunteer to you? Well. No, come on. Med school keeps me way too busy to do any volunteer work. Last time I ever volunteered for anything I think was um, a bake sale in middle school. I made burnt cookies. Really, really great recipe. I can share it with you if you'd like. Please. Yeah. Do you wanna put that on? You look, so beautiful. That's very sweet but, sometimes people look at me and they only see this, this one thing. Sometimes I know that they don't like me because of it. I met you and for a split second I thought this would just all be so much easier if I wasn't Muslim, which is horrible, but... So you hid it. I thought that I could not hide this part of myself but just delay you knowing about it until I felt, safe. I don't know, it sounds stupid but, I, I haven't been wearing it recently. You don't have to hide that part of yourself from me. You don't have to hide anything with me. Okay. Thank you. I won't. Because uh, I'd like to keep seeing you, if that's something that's interesting to you. Are you sure? Times are changing. People will look at us, my parents included. Fuck 'em. Not your parents, of course, no. I will win them over easy enough. Oh yeah? Are you ready to convert? Oh, easy. One step at a time. Okay, then, hold my hand. This is my country, my damn country. Give me my country, you can keep the rest. This is my country, my damn country. And it don't mean a thing if it don't past the test. I'm drawn like a moth to the neon lights I need a bucket of beer and someone to fight. Don't call yourself country if your music is shitty. Or this Carolina boy'll take you down to Fist City. You know who you are, I ain't gonna name names. Just keep your hands off my country. And go back from where ya came. This is my country, my damn country. Give me my country, you can keep the rest. This is my country, my damn country. And it don't mean a thing if it don't pass the test. If you can't sing along to Tear In My Beer. Then don't forget your coat. And get the fuck outta here
