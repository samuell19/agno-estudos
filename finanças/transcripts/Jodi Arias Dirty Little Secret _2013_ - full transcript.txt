How do you want me? Just like that. Like that? Yeah. I like that, 'cause the light's coming through it. Are you really thinking that? That's a good one. Love it. Perfect. Come on. Tell me what to do! Yeah, keep doing that. Look back at me. That's pretty sexy. These are kind of amazing. You know that camera has a video function, right? Want me to put some makeup on, shoot a porno? 911 operator, what is your emergency? A friend of ours is dead in his bathroom. Ma'am? We haven't heard from him in a while. Ma'am, I need you to tell me. Could you... There's blood everywhere. I-I understand that. Could you please tell me what... I'm gonna give the phone to someone else! Who? Hello, hello? Ma'am? He's dead. Please tell me what's going on. He's in his bathroom. He's in the shower. Okay, who is in the shower? It's, uh... It's all over the place. Okay, listen to me carefully. I need all of you out of the house immediately. Good afternoon, everybody. I'm Travis Alexander, and I love my life. Now, if there are any of you out there who can't say the same thing, then let's get you there! Everyone wants basically the same things in life, right? Success, purpose, love. Well, these things are attainable, and what's worked for me is committing to the steps. These are very simple rules that, if you follow them, I can almost guarantee that you will reach your goals. Now, before we get started, obviously, you have to know what your goals are. So do me a favor. Everyone here, I want you to shut your eyes. Now, you might feel a slight sensation of someone tugging at your wallet, and it's just your imagination. Keep your eyes closed. Everyone here has to focus on one single thing, and that is what you want your life to be. Put a bull's-eye on what it is you want and promise yourself that you will never let anything get in your way. Picture what you want. See it. Now open your eyes. So, think about it. It's me, five sisters, and a brother, and we're all growing up in this little pickup camper. Mom's dirt-poor. Dad's long gone. We don't even know where the next sandwich is coming from. So I'm just trying to illustrate to you guys that there's no pit so deep that you can't climb out of it. That's how I began my life, and now I have my own house, drive a BMW. I have great friends. So if that dirty, little kid in a pickup truck can do it, why can't you? Because we are mere mortals in your supernatural glow, Travis. And then you've got guys like Nick here. This guy's been my best friend for, what, 10 years, and you've come to like a dozen of these things, but, uh, he doesn't listen. He just likes to come 'cause he likes to get out of town. Did it ever occur to you that my goal was to become an accountant, and I already achieved that? Well, so now you got to set new goals, 'cause that's what life's about. You're never supposed to be finished. Like right now, my new goal is to find the men's room, and I shall not yield until I succeed. I just want you to know I think you're amazing. Whoa! Men's room. What you were saying earlier at the conference... You were so right. You know, that thing about how we have to stop letting things happen and start making things happen... Yep. Just trying to make things happen here. God, you know, it's funny. It's like it sounds so obvious when I hear you say it out loud, but it's like I feel stupid for not thinking of it myself. Yeah. You know, sometimes, we just need a gentle nudge. Yeah. That's me. Boy, is that me. I am so ready for a change. I'm Jodi, by the way. Travis. I like that one there. Just that one? No. I like all of them. But, uh, you know, my instinct would have been to shoot the sunset, and the tree's it. The tree makes it. Yeah. I think I've developed kind of an eye. I mean, I like sales. I think I'm pretty good at sales. It's just photography has always been where the passion is, you know? So, why aren't you going for it? I meet a guy, and suddenly, he's got all my enthusiasm, so... What about your current boyfriend? Does he support your passion? Wow. Subtle. Oh, you're the only man in my life, Travis, at the moment. And you're the only woman within four feet of me, Jodi. I feel so much closer to you lately. We have made some great strides recently. Seven, I think. But have I made you happy, Travis? Very. Although I should tell you, I'm seeing another woman. Well, we'll always have our memories. Hmm. It's late. Is it past your bedtime? Way. But, hey, it's Vegas, right? Well, we can't have you falling asleep, can we? Let's go up to your room for a cup of coffee. I should tell you... I'm a mormon. Okay. That's cool. So the thing is, is that mormons aren't supposed to... Drink coffee. Okay, maybe there was some confusion here. I was just suggesting that we go up to your room, tear off each other's clothes, oil each other down, and see how quickly we can turn your bed into splinters. You know, coffee. Well, you said to put a bull's-eye on what I want. So, let me ask you... ...what do you want, Travis? Okay. I'm not gonna do this, and I'm gonna tell you why. You blow me away, Jodi. You've got this thirst for self-betterment, which is what I've devoted my entire life to. So as much as I want to go and do the whole oil and bed-splintering thing... And I really, really do... I think it would be better that if you knew, in my eyes, you were a whole lot more than just a... hot... Cup of coffee. Well, let me tell you something, Mr. Travis Alexander. That right there... Was the correct answer. What are you doing tomorrow? We got a thing in palm Springs next month. It's kind of a recruiting deal. Maybe you should come. I don't want to wait a month to see you. Why do you have to live so far away? Palm desert's like 400 miles from mesa. What is that, couple hours in a car? No. It's five hours. Okay, so hit cruise control, put something in that'll play for hours. In fact, I have a great mix of gospel music for you. It's, like, religious stuff, but it'll get your heart pumping. Religious music? Yeah. You don't like religious music? I... no. Travis? Katie! Holy crap! What are you doing here?! The temple here in Las Vegas. It's a fellowship weekend. I haven't seen you in forever. Well, you're always out of town, aren't you? Jodi, um, this is Katie. She, um, goes to my church. Hey, I'm here with Paul and Helen. No way. Yeah! They have a table! You should come say hi. I'm just gonna be one minute, okay? Sure. Hello! Good to see you. Hey, man. How are you? Looking good. Don't laugh. It's not that funny. So, who's up for another round? Two ginger ales are my limit. Besides, I should get back. Oh, boy. Uh, you know what? I think I've been rude, it was great seeing you guys. You, go to bed. All right, man. Good night. Damn. Hey. Hey. I called your room. Yeah. I'm not there. I'm sorry about before. I didn't mean to leave you in the lurch. I just hadn't seen... You know? ♪ You know I can't resist ♪ when you hold me close like this ♪ ♪ when you do those things you do ♪ ♪ when you hold me close to you ♪ ♪ kiss close ♪ can you give me kiss close? ♪ Kiss close ♪ can you give me kiss close? ♪ You're my dirty, little secret ♪ ♪ if you think that you can keep it ♪ ♪ in a picture-perfect dream ♪ where our kisses can't be seen ♪ ♪ kiss close ♪ can you give me kiss close? All that and he can sing, too? Sounds like Mr. Perfect. He doesn't have a great big "s" emblazoned on his chest, does he? Quit it! You're gonna like this one. I just want you to walk a little carefully this time, honey. You tend to date... Jerks. Gee, grandma, don't whitewash it. Well, come on, sweetheart. You have to admit. I mean, the guy who wanted to hunt vampires? I was 15. Okay. Well, what about the geezer? He was 40. He was twice your age, and he strung you along for years. I've just seen guys hurt you too many times. When you get your heart broken, mine breaks, too. I only get hurt if they cheat on me. But that's the difference about Travis. He's totally not the cheating type. He does have a wienie, doesn't he? Yes, he does. But he's religious. His faith really means a lot to him. You just don't find that in most guys. He sounds very nice. I'm sure he is. Just let things happen naturally with this one. Don't start picking China patterns right out of the gate. Hi! Come on in! Hi. I don't think we've met. I'm Jodi. I'm Travis' girlfriend. Oh. Say hi, Napoleon! Hi! Aw, he misses his daddy. Uh, Travis is out back. Okay. Wow. You didn't have to do that. Oh, it's nothing. Those are new. Oh, aren't they amazing? I got them at a mesa swap meet. Wow. The place looks beautiful. Thank you. I've had so much fun decorating this awesome pad. Come on out back. So, we've got my special strawberry lemonade over there. Uh, other drinks are in the cooler. And grill master Alexander's working his magic. Really? Oh, boy. So, was it like a rasping or a wheezing, or was it a combo of the two? Um, it was ridiculous. I thought I was going to suffocate. Well, Angela, that's the price you got to pay to the pilates gods. Anyone can tell your chakras are out of whack. Seriously, I'll show you. See if you can breathe through this. Okay. It's a position called the saw. Oh, gosh. Okay. Is it supposed to tickle? Mm, not sure. All right. Hey, gang. Hey. Hey, guys. You just saved me from the saw. Do you mind if I borrow him for a bit? Uh, sure. Will you do the honors? Be very gentle. They're my children. Aye, aye, captain. Hey, what's up? I'm just rescuing you from Angela. I could tell she was boring you. No, a-Angela's cool. She's... she's telling me about her pilates instructor. He's obsessed with controlling her breathing. That's riveting. Okay, wise ass, you had to be there. I prefer being here. J-Jodi, Jodi, people are like five feet away. Then you better control your breathing. Thanks for coming, guys. Take care. Babe? I can't say goodbye? Well, then, they'll all think you're staying over. I am staying. What? Wait. What's the big deal? They gonna excommunicate you from the church or something? No, but they don't need to know everything we do. So, wait, what? I'm just your dirty, little secret? Not just. What else am I to you? Well, you're a... How do you mean? I mean... Like, do you even know what my middle name is? I want to say it's Phillip. It's Ann. Well, that's nice! But how was I supposed to know that? You never told me. You never asked me. You never ask me about me. You don't know about my parents, about where I went to school. Well, I would have got around to it. I care about those things, really. It's just when we're alone, we're not doing all that much talking. We're not alone enough, Travis. You always have too many people around. You want to be alone? Then let's get out of here... Just the two of us. Oh, I like that one. Yeah. Aww. Look at how cute you look. You like it? Mm-hmm. You take a nice picture. You big dork. You fell more than I did. You're the one on camera, pal. Yeah, well, that's why we have delete buttons. Oh, I am gonna sleep tonight. Sleep? We're on vacation. Hotel beds aren't made for sleep. Oh. Oh. Mr. Travis Alexander, whatever would the church folk think? Hey, don't... Don't bring that into it, huh? I'm not supposed to be doing most of the stuff we've already covered, Jodi. Right. I'm like coffee. Yeah, like very strong coffee. So, explain this whole coffee thing to me. I mean, what's that about? Like, I-I understand you're not supposed to drink alcohol, right? Too much alcohol is bad. It makes you an alcoholic. I get that. But coffee? Coffee is addicting, too. Well, so are nutter butters for some people. Yeah, but that's the thing. I can have nutter butters, but if I find that I'm becoming addicted to them, I got to give them up. You're kidding? Well, then, anything can be off-limits. Knitting can be off-limits. Yep. Well, then, what about me? I mean, am I addicting to you? No. I can quit you anytime I want. I just choose not to. Yeah. You're not alcoholic when it comes to me. No, just a very heavy drinker. Hey. You almost gave me a heart attack. I'm sorry. You headed home? Yeah. A long trip, and I'm getting a late start. What's up? Came to fetch your boy to shoot some hoops. He's still sleeping. It's 1:00 in the afternoon. Well, we were up late. Uh, it's nothing a bucket of ice water won't fix. Really, Nick, maybe it's better if you come back later. Travis prefers it if people call first. Yeah? Well, I'm not people, Jodi. You drive safe. T-dogg. Hey. What's going on? You tell me. Do you know what time it is? I was up late. Oh, yeah. I heard from your girlfriend. She's not my girlfriend. Okay, sorry. Your, uh, "three-hole wonder," as you so poetically like to put it. Dude, what are you doing? I'm wondering how I went to bed with a beautiful woman next to me and I'm waking up to you. No, I mean, what are you doing? Nobody ever sees you anymore. And what's up with all this flowery crap? It's like Martha Stewart jumped on a grenade in here. Okay. So, what's it to you? She brought a woman's touch to the place. Seriously? Look, man, I don't know what to tell you. But look at this girl. If she was offering up to you what she's offering up to me, you'd get it. Hmm. You bringing these to Bible study tonight? I got it under control. Get dressed. "We are all infected and impure with sin. "When we display our righteous deeds, they are nothing but filthy rags." They wrote about my underwear in the Bible? So, at first glance, this passage seems confusing, but if we look deeper, I think the message is pretty simple. I think what it's saying... Excuse me, guys. I'm just gonna take this really quick, okay? Hey. Where you at? On a very boring stretch of road. Keep me company. I've got another hour of this. I'd love to, but I'm right in the middle of something. Are you throwing a party? It's Bible study. I hear girls there. Girls are allowed at Bible study, Jodi. The mormons even let them show their ankles in public. Don't be sarcastic with me. Oh, what's everybody laughing at? What's so funny? I don't know what they're laughing at because I'm talking to you right now. Why don't you give me a call when you get home? We'll be done by then. You'll be done? What, screwing those bimbos? Well, I got to get them drunk first, don't I? So give me a minute here. Oh, sure, Travis. You think you're funny? Look, really, I can't talk, okay? I got to get back. I'll talk to you later. You did not just hang up on me. Hello?! Son of a bitch! What? Jodi, what are you doing here? Jodi? What are you doing? Hey, what's wrong? Whose is this? It's yours, dummy. What is going on in that head? Look. Nobody's here. No, I know. I-I just thought... It's not my fault. I just missed you. You're kind of crazy. You know that? It's funny, 'cause I was just having a dream about you. Good dream or a bad dream? A pretty good dream. So, where are you taking me for breakfast? Cocoa puffs are in the kitchen. You treat me like a queen, Travis. I told you. I got to be at church in an hour. I got a better idea. Blow it off, and we'll go, I don't know, horseback riding. I can't just blow it off. Of course you can. Call in sick. I don't want to call in sick. You know I wasn't expecting you to be here today, right? Yeah, but I am here. I mean, you never seem to have a problem blowing things off when it's something you want. Jodi, we talked about this. I'm the one that always makes the five-hour trip from palm desert. I think you should be a little more flexible. It's just church, Travis. Look, I know I haven't been too strict with the rules lately, but it's not "just church" to me. How am I supposed to know when you're being pious Travis or horny Travis? You're right. I've been a big, dumb jerk a lot of the time. But we've talked about this. My religion is very important to me. Look at my life. All of my friends are mormons. Someday, I'll marry a mormon. It's not nothing to me. So, let him marry some prissy, little twit. He's just another guy, Jodi. He's not just another guy. Of course he is. They all are. I mean, they got to be lining up. I mean, look at you. Well, not look at you now. I mean normally. Look, you're... You're gorgeous. I mean, you've got to let them chase you. Nobody even really knows what's going on between us because he doesn't even act like I'm his girlfriend in public. Great. He's ashamed of you, too? Some guy. No. I mean, it's because of his whole religious thing. Look, Travis has got this tremendous... Got this tremendous what? I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about his heart, you know, his soul. Well, sweetheart, all three are important. I mean, the sex is really great, but it's... It's so not about that. I mean, Travis... Travis loves me. He completely loves me. He just... Doesn't know it? Listen, you know how I was, like, bouncing all over the place after I dropped out of high school. I mean, you saw me. Travis is... He's helping me find a direction. And I mean, we talk, like, every day for hours. I mean, I can't remember the last time I talked to my freaking parents, you know? Didn't you spend hours on the phone with other boyfriends? Yeah, well, they spent hours telling me what a hot piece of ass I was. I mean, did I tell you that the first night I met Travis, he turned me down? And he said it was because I was a smart, like, complex, you know, like... Like a real human being. I don't know, like, I've never... I've never felt that before. Look, you got to ask yourself what you want, Jodi, and it seems like he's already said what he's looking for. I just want to be the girl that he wants. He's just saying that he misses me. What do you demand?! Success! How will you succeed?! The 10 steps! Thank you. Right on. Thank you. Thanks. Hey, you! Hey. Whoa. I've been thinking about you. Me too. Oh, Travis. Baby... I have a surprise for you. Yeah? Mm-hmm. It's something I really want to do. Yeah? Well, if it's better than this, I'm dying to know. Mm, I've been thinking about it a lot. I think you're really gonna like it. I decided I'm gonna convert. I'm gonna become a mormon. Am I hurting you? Yeah, but in a good way. So, she just brought that up out of the blue? She said she wanted to be baptized. It's a good thing, right? Okay, you guys obviously have something you want to say. So, we're all friends here. Come on. Let's hear it. Listen, Travis, it's none of our business here, but don't you think she's being a little obsessive, a little creepy? Y-You know her way better than we do, okay, but is this girl really the kind of girl that you're looking for? Okay, so you guys don't like her. Let's put that on the table. No. She's fine. It's just... we don't like her for you. Guys, I appreciate the concern, but Jodi's cool... Really. And nobody's talking anything long-term, so... Okay, man. All right. It's just we care a lot about you, you know, and, I mean, I... Hi, guys. When did you get here? They were on their way. They stopped by to say hello. Oh, well, I'm glad I got to see you before you left. Hon, I thought we were gonna stay in the bedroom. Oh, I'm sorry. We were thirsty. So, what are you guys talking about? Jodi, I'd really appreciate it if you put some clothes on. Mm. Is that what you'd like in the short term? What are you talking about? I'm talking about you and I apparently aren't, um, long-term? Listen, Jodi, you know I think that you're amazing, and our friendship is hugely... Oh, god. You got to be kidding me. "Our friendship"?! Keep it down. I mean, we are friends, right? Nick's your friend, too. When's the last time you bent him over the bed? Babe, we've only been together for what, like five months? What is that supposed to mean? What's the magic length of time supposed to be? How long does it take you to know what you want, Travis?! I knew in Vegas! I don't know what you want me to tell you right now. You're breathing down my neck here. Well, what more are you looking for? I never said I was looking for anything! And I'm certainly not... Not ready to talk about that. Oh, god. You can't even say the word out loud. What, you're not ready for that... marriage? Or you're not ready for that marriage with me? You think I'm gonna be your Booty call forever? If so, man up and tell me. Jodi... Who the hell's Marie? A girl that I know. How well do you know her? Well enough that she texts me from time to time. This is crazy! You're acting crazy! This is like insane jealousy! I feel like a prostitute, Travis, a piece of toilet paper. It is way too soon to be discussing this. Marriage?! I know I can say that out loud. I think you and I need to take a break. You're breaking up with me? I just... I think that we need to take some time and rethink things, all right? It's way too much. And if you're gonna say it like that and you need an answer right now, in that case, yes. Hello? Hello? Hey, who the hell's in here? Surprise! Happy birthday! Happy birthday! Happy birthday, old man. Aw, adult diapers. I could have used these about 10 seconds ago. Hey. Did we get you? No, no, Travis. Jodi was a skank. She wasn't a skank. She just... No, she should have seen the looks she gave us when you weren't around. Yeah, well, you live and you learn, right? Where are you taking me? I want to give you your birthday present. Okay, close your eyes. Come on. Really? Just hear me out. I want you to close your eyes and picture something that you want. I heard this from some motivational speaker once. Complete hack, but he had some good points. Just close them. Come on. Okay, now, I want you to picture the perfect woman for Travis Alexander. See her. Now open your eyes. She's a little young. Happy birthday. Hey, Katie, get over here. We need your nacho expertise. Everybody has a gift. You're not stupid, Travis. You'll know her when you find her. No, I'm actually really happy to be out of it. Are you? Now that it's over, you know? So, anyone new on the horizon? Hmm, maybe. That is music to my ears. I never thought the guy was right for you. Travis is a good person. No, no, look. Just concentrate on the future. It's gonna be what you make of it. Sheri, I promise you, it is all behind me. Step five. There's no such thing as no... Unless you're in the back seat of your car, guys, and then you got to take her no very seriously. But in terms of our bigger goals, when someone says no, you got to hear maybe, and it's up to you to convince them when they're wrong. ♪ In this farewell ♪ there's no blood ♪ there's no alibi ♪ 'cause I've drawn regret ♪ from the truth ♪ of a thousand lies ♪ so let mercy come ♪ and wash away ♪ what I've done ♪ I'll face myself ♪ to cross out what I've become ♪ ♪ erase myself ♪ and let go of what I've done ♪ what I've done ♪ forgiving what I've done Hey. I knew I'd run into you eventually. What? What are you... What are you doing here? I live here now. I moved here about a week ago. You moved here, to mesa? Things haven't really been working out in palm desert, so I figured i'd, uh, take a shot here and look for work. That's... that's cool. I just... I wouldn't think that... Relax, Travis. I'm here for the town, not for you. No. I mean, I really came to love this place from our... you know, our time together. I'm relaxed. I'm totally... I'm really glad to see you. Me too. I feel really stupid about the way we left things. It was totally my fault. No, come on. Really, Travis, I painted you into a corner. I had no right. I'm sorry. Hey, listen, step number two, be positive in your attitude, right? That's right. Step two. Be positive. So, you're here looking for work? You know, right now, I'm just looking for anything to tide me over. And I'm not above waitressing or cleaning houses. So, I mean, no pressure, but if you know someone... Jodi's maid service. Bonjour. I just thought you'd find the outfit funny. You want funny... I still expect you to clean my house. Oui, oui, monsieur. This was maybe not the best idea. You didn't like? I liked. I liked way too much. There you go, getting nervous again. This was just... We're having fun. I mean... unless you want it to mean something more. No, no. I-I like how you put it. We're just having fun. Doesn't have to mean anything more than it does. That's what we got going. We're cool with that, right? Totally cool with it. Where are you going? Well, you didn't expect me to stay the night, did you? I hadn't thought about it, but you can if you want to. Travis, this is better. We're friends. And I'm cool with it, really. Hey. You know not to mention this to anybody, right? Didn't I just say I was cool with it? And then he turns around and sends her money. Um... I need to go. Hi. Hey. "Thanks for sending me your photo shoot. "Why don't you have that guy take you out into the woods and screw you like the animal you are?" "Yikes. You sound pretty jealous "for a guy who just wants to be friends. "What happened to 'nothing has to mean anything more than it does'?" "Simply stating that you're a slut and a whore "doesn't mean I'm jealous. It's just a fact. "So you can stop pretending you give a crap about me. "This just proves I was never anything to you but a dildo with a heartbeat." "You would not be reacting this way to someone "who didn't mean something to you. "Maybe you don't see me as just a friend. Maybe you're realizing now that you never wanted to." "You go right ahead and think that "if it makes you feel good about yourself, Jodi. "How about this? We're not friends anymore either." Of course it wasn't me, Katie. I wouldn't write that. She obviously stole my password! Alexander, get in here. I-I got to go. I'll call you. Listen, John, s-somebody obviously hacked my account. I mean, you can't... You can't think that... Why are you telling me this? I don't need a confession. I want a clean slate. All right. If we're cleaning slates, you're not the only one who's done stuff, Travis. One night... this was about a year ago... I was on a date with this guy, Steve, and he was driving me home, and he parked in front of my house, and he gave me... That look. So I undid my seatbelt. He never bothered to undo his. He just sat there. His eyes were saying like, "we're gonna do this. It's because you want it just as much as I do." And I lean over to him, and he turns in his chair, just to give me a better angle. I don't know. And I just... Close my eyes, and I give him a full-on... Kiss good night. Like on his lips and everything. I hate every one of your guts right now. I got you! Oh! I got you. I'm not... I am gonna get you back for that. No. I don't know if you can. No. We're even now. How do you figure? That's twice you got me. Yeah, but gentlemen don't retaliate. That's the unwritten law. Oh, no. You have it coming, when you least expect it. Oh, you don't scare me. I eat punks like you for breakfast. You should be scared. It's okay. Just some stupid kids. You got to be kidding me. I mean, when are you gonna get the cops in on this, Travis? It's like fraud or identity theft, isn't it? Plus, she damaged your property. I mean, what does this skank have to do before you take her seriously? I take it seriously. Don't call her that. Then press charges. She's stalking you. She's venting... loudly. Look, man, I let this thing go on too long with her. It's my fault. Let's just let her get it out of her system. She's gonna burn herself out before long. T-dogg, you got to pull your head out of your ass. This thing is getting dangerous. You're messing with this girl's head. You know what, Nick? Why don't you focus on getting yourself a girl and stop instructing me about my choices? Look, man, I know you're just looking out for me. She hasn't bugged me in like three days, okay? So if it ain't over yet, it's gonna be over soon. Are we playing or what? Travis... Mm, no. Travis, no. I don't... I don't do that. Hmm. Okay. Now, that right there... ...was the correct answer. Do you want to watch a movie? Yeah. Something g-rated with, like, really ugly people in it. Popcorn? Coming right up. Hey. Hey. Oh, it's morning. Well, you got me to sleep with you. Congratulations. It wasn't as good as I thought it would be. Didn't live up to the hype? Please tell me you have orange juice. I have orange juice. Just help yourself, okay? I'll be back in a second. Hey. I've been thinking about you. Jodi, we need to talk right now. I know what that means. Well, you're out of luck. I'm at my grandparents' house in yreka. You broke into my house. What's wrong with you? You have no respect for my privacy. And those pictures... Are you nuts? Jodi, this crap's got to stop right now or it's gonna get ugly very fast. Travis... you're only looking at the bad things. It's normal for people to get jealous sometimes. People argue. Listen, Jodi, I'm hanging up the phone, okay? Just please... I wish you well. I really, really do, and I'm sorry, but you have to leave me alone. You gonna go hang out with your little twinkie right now? It's gonna... Not gonna last, Travis. She's not gonna challenge you. She's not gonna improve you. She's just a pretty, little distraction. That's it. And one day, you Mark me, she'll just disappear on you. Goodbye, Jodi. Hi, grandma. Jodi! I haven't seen you in such a long time. I know. I've just been so busy. I'm sorry. Oh. Where's grandpa? He's at the hardware store. What have you been doing with yourself? I like that skirt. Is it new? Jodi, you need to call your mother. Mom and I aren't in a talking way right now. She's just worried about you. I'm fine. We're all worried about you. I mean... Do you want to talk to me about anything? I am fine. Sweetie, I just love you so much. I just want you to be happy. Everyone who loves you wants you to be happy. My life is unconventional. I know that. But that doesn't mean there's something wrong with me. I don't need to talk. Travis accepts me for who I am. I should get going. I've got to grab a couple things from my room. Hawaii? For real? Two tickets, hotel rooms, food. Company pays for everything. Heck yeah, I'll go! Are you kidding?! I'm gonna need a new bathing suit, so will your company pay for that, too? Bathing suit? You don't want tan lines, do you? Katie? "If you sleep under the same roof as him, you will be giving the appearance of evil." Katie, you there? "You are a daughter of god, "and you have been a shameful example. Be thou clean. Sin no more." Hey, sexy man. My god, you really are without a clue, aren't you? Okay, let's just talk this out. Go away, Jodi! Get out of my life! You don't want that. I-I don't know how to make myself any more clear to you! I am done! Do you not understand me?! Do you not hear me?! No, I hear you, but neither one of us believes it. How dare you threaten Katie?! If I have to call the cops, I'm prepared to. So call the cops. What's that gonna do? Maybe it'll open your eyes to reality. I see what's going on here way more clearly than you. Jodi! You're not pushing me away because I'm bad for you. You're doing it because you think you have to live your life based on these idiotic steps of yours. But you're the one who needs to open your eyes, Travis, because every time you see me, you can't resist me. You can't. That's because I'm really what you want. Jodi... You're missing something really big here. In all the time that we spent together, did I ever once say that I love you? I didn't say it 'cause it wasn't true. You were a girlfriend, Jodi. I liked you. I enjoyed being with you. But I never loved you. You don't know your own feelings. I looked into your eyes, Travis. I saw it. Jodi, you saw lust... You saw weakness, but you didn't see love. It was never there. I'm with Katie now. I need to hear that you understand that. Tell me, Jodi. I understand, Travis. Everything's clear now. I saw your light on. I just wanted to say goodbye. Come on in, Jodi. I'm actually really glad to see you. I like the brunette thing. It's very nice. I got some hot water on. You want some of that tea you like? Sure. So, where are you headed? What do you mean? You said you came to say goodbye. I'm moving back to California. That's a whole lot of good-looking that Arizona's gonna lose. Why are you being so nice to me? 'Cause you're easy to be with, Jodi. So are lots of girls. Yeah, but you and I... We're always on the same wavelength when we're together. Other girls are so much damn work. What happened to what's her name... Katie? She thinks I have abandoned my principles. Maybe she's right. She broke up with you? Looks that way. You did some really messed-up stuff, Jodi. I know. I'm sorry. Do you want to stay? You don't want to be alone... Or you want to... Be with me? I want you, Jodi. How do you want me? Just like that. Like that? Yeah. Perfect. How do you like your new camera? I'm starting to see what your fascination is with this thing. Our eyes see all sorts of things we don't want them to see every day. But the camera lens... that only sees what you want it to. This is what I want to see right here. And if it sees something you don't want, you can just delete it, and it's gone forever. Deep. I like this one. This one? Let me see this. You got to flex in this one. Come on. Do it. Very nice. Come on. You got to make love to the camera. You know that camera has a video function, right? Oh, yeah? Want me to put some makeup on, shoot a porno? Maybe after a little rehearsal. ♪ I want a girl ♪ just like the girl that married dear, old dad ♪ ♪ she was a Pearl and the only girl that daddy ever had ♪ Hey, keep those north of the equator, would you? I better not see these on the Internet. The camera loves you, Travis. Let me see those pecs. Uh-huh. Yeah, you look good. Okay, that's enough. I'm done. No, wait. Let's just take a couple more. Come on. Face the wall. Let me see those big, broad shoulders. Yeah. That's it. You look good, Travis. You know you don't have to sweet-talk me if you want to get some of this. I'm done talking. 911 operator, what is your emergency? A friend of ours is dead in his bathroom. Ma'am? We haven't heard from him in a while. Ma'am, I need you to tell me. Could you... There's blood everywhere. Seal it off. Tommy, there's a digital camera coming down to you which somebody tried to wash clean, along with some bloody sheets and clothes. Get it to the lab forthwith. See if we can find out what they don't want us to see. What are we looking at? Body parts. Well, hello, darling. And who might you be? Do you think someone could grab my makeup before we leave? Just let me know when, okay? I'm gonna need you to be honest with me, Jodi. I was not at Travis' house. That's not gonna help you. Admitting to something I didn't do won't help me either. Oh, my god. Is that... That's blood. You got to be freaking kidding me. We have a photo of the killing as it's happening? I witnessed, um, Travis being attacked by two other individuals. They were white Americans. Um, from what I could tell, they were wearing, uh, like... What do you call those things? Like... like, um, beanies that cover your whole face, um, like... like masks. And they kept arguing about whether or not to kill me, and then they pulled the trigger, and nothing happened. Dirty text messages entered into evidence, nude pictures, audiotape of... of phone sex between the victim and the defendant. Randi kaye reports on the case that has so many people riveted. But first, I just want to warn you, as I've said, there's some very graphic details woven through this case which may be too explicit for younger viewers. Travis Alexander never had a chance. She had a very normal background. There's nothing in her history. She doesn't have a criminal record. She was with a guy before she was with Travis. Okay, this wound went straight back to his spine, nearly decapitating him. The victim was stabbed 27 times front and back. He was then shot once in the face, though the medical examiner believes that this wound was posthumous. It didn't bleed. Detective flores... ...you're not gonna believe this. I've seen it. You've seen it, but you haven't seen it. We got the full picture now right here. It's the top of the victim's head. Okay. His body is lying stretching away from the camera. It's this stuff on the left here that's been hard to make out, but... look. That's a hand. Right. And here... That's a leg... And sweatpants, white stripes. I'll be damned. That's a photograph of our killer dragging the body back into the bathroom, where we found him. Jodi, I don't think ever in the entire history of criminal investigation, has there been a killer who has provided us with a photograph of themselves actually committing the murder. Your blood was in that house, mixed with his. I don't think I could stab him. I think... I would shoot him continuously until he was dead. These are some of the photos you guys took of each other on the day of the murder. That one looks like me. Are you sure these aren't from another time? No, it's you, Jodi. They're date- and time-stamped. I'm not a murderer, but, I mean, if I were to kill somebody, I would use gloves. I have plenty of gloves. Jodi... it's over. I promise to tell the truth, the whole truth, so help me god. Did you kill Travis Alexander June 4, 2008? Yes, I did. Why? The simple answer is he attacked me, and I defended myself. So he wanted to kill you because you dropped his camera? Jodi arias was Travis Alexander's dirty, little secret. She killed him because he simply gave her no other choice. Show us how Travis lunged to you. He just came at me, like that, like... Like a linebacker, like... like that. It's the only way I know how to describe it. - Tell me what you're gonna do. - Tell me again, baby. I'm gonna tie you to a tree, and I'm gonna stick it all the way in. I did these things because I wanted to please him. Did you enjoy these things that he wanted you to do? I enjoyed his attention. Would you describe Mr. Alexander as a sexual deviant? That's actually a polite way of putting it. When he'd get upset, he'd send me really mean e-mails. He'd call me things like whore and slut. And when he would do this to you, how did it make you feel? Well, sometimes it hurt if it got in my eyes. Travis kind of got off on debasing me. He said, "don't act like it hurts." Then he called me a bitch and kicked me in the ribs. And then he went to kick me again. And I put my hand... One married man even wants to leave his wife after meeting arias for just three hours. Lucky Jodi arias' sex mojo doesn't work on a jury. After the gun went off, what happened then? I have no memory of anything that happened after that. It's all just a fog. Jodi, continuing to lie will not help you. A records check shows a report of a gun stolen from her grandparents' house, a .25 auto. A-And what kind of gun was used to kill Travis Alexander? A .25-caliber automatic. When I walked in, Travis was on the bed, masturbating. And he started grabbing at something on the bed, and I could see it was a little... A picture of a little boy in his underwear. Did you tell anyone about this? No. Did you write about this anywhere in your personal diary? No. Did you confront him in any of the 82,000 texts we have on file about his deviant behavior? I didn't use the word "deviant." You did. Answer the question. No. So, then, we're supposed to believe this story based only on the testimony of a well-documented liar? Who has the premeditation to bring a butcher knife and a gun to go have sex wither ex-boyfriend? If Travis broke your finger in January, why does it look perfectly normal in this photograph taken in may? It's not normal. It's crooked. It's crooked now because you hurt it when you were killing Mr. Alexander. Arias' defense is falling apart. Lie after lie after lie, and none of them are holding up. You went there with the sole intention of murdering Travis Alexander, and you did whatever you could to cover your tracks. Hey, Travis. What's going on? It's almost midnight. So, listen, um, we were talking about your upcoming travels my way, and I was looking at the may calendar. Duh! Jodi arias came to Arizona with three full five-gallon gas cans in her trunk. Why? So there'd be no receipts in Arizona or the possibility of her image on a security camera. She knew that she was coming to kill him. There is no other reason. Hi. Detective flores, I just wanted to offer any assistance I can. I was a really good friend of Travis'. You had the audacity to attend Travis' memorial. You sat there with the family of the man who you stabbed 29 times, most of them in his back, pretending to mourn, right along with them. They think you're obsessed. "Obsessed" was the word they used. That's the word I hear used by everybody. Were you crying while you were shooting him? I don't remember. Were you crying when you were stabbing him? I don't remember. How about when you cut his throat? Were you crying then? I don't know. I have nothing further. "The state of Arizona versus Jodi Ann arias. "Verdict, count one. "We, the jury, "duly empanelled and sworn in the above-entitled action, "upon our oaths do find the defendant "as to count one, first-degree murder, guilty. "Five jurors find premeditated. "Zero find felony murder. "Seven find both premeditated and felony. Signed foreperson." Is this your true verdict, so say you one and all? Yes. I'm sorry, Travis. I'm so sorry. You could have had any guy you wanted, Jodi. Why me? Because I loved you. You found a hell of a way to show it. Why didn't you want me, Travis? Why didn't you love me back? Why didn't you love me back? Why didn't you love me back? ♪ O, holy night, the stars are brightly shining ♪ ♪ it is the night of our dear savior's birth ♪ ♪ long lay the world in sin and error pining ♪ ♪ till he appeared and the soul felt its worth ♪
