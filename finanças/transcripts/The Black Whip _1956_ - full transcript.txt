Let him out! Aw, now, Lady, you... ...you wouldn't want me to turn a killer like Hainline loose. I know how to use this. Let him out! Thanks, hon. Hurry! There's no need to rush now, hon. There is for me. If I'm off the floor too long... Oh, never mind, hon. What about him? Oh, don't worry none about him. Chick! Chick! Well, thank her, Garner. Hm. She just saved your life. Come on, hon. All right. You did fine, hon. Thanks. You're gonna be all right, Garner. How did it happen? A woman sneaked in here and held me up. A woman? She made me open the cell, then Hainline hit me with his gun. A fancy gal. Leastways, she smelled fancy. You recognize her? She had some kind of a hood over her face, and talked real low. Kind of a whisper. Yeah, whisky voice. Would you know her again? It'd be tough. Well, why do you say "fancy" girl? Well, she said something about, "Bein' off the floor too long." That's a saloon term. How long's he been out? Ehh, there's no way of tellin'. She came in not long after midnight. At least six hours. Posse's no good this late. I'll have to send out telegrams, let the whole county know about this. What's the matter with you? Hainline's a cheap gunman, and he's escaped. You'll catch him. You've caught that kind before. No, doc. I won't catch this one. What do you mean? I wish I could tell you, doc. I wish I could... Stay where you are, Garner. Which room is Jeanie's? Head of the stairs. Yeah? Open up, Jeanie! - What for? - Come on out. You got a warrant, or is this a social call? - I said, come on out. - Let me go! I've got my rights! Not anymore, you haven't. Not in this town. Take it easy, Floyd. What's all the commotion? - What is it, Jeanie? - What's the matter? You ladidi come on downstairs. If you don't, we'll bring you down, regardless. - Regardless? - What's going on? You going to use force, Floyd? Everybody downstairs. Line up over there, ladies, against the bar. All right, Garner. They're all yours. You like it? Sure he does. Having fun? Well? I'm sorry, Mr. Persons. I don't recognize none of them. Now maybe you'll tell us what this is all about. Garner swears one of you let that Black Leg killer out of jail last night. Let who out? What's a Black Leg, Mr. Persons? They're something a man and his family go down in their cellar to wait for 'em to pass. Pray for 'em to pass. They're what's left of Quantrill's guerillas. They move at night and they got nowhere to go. They're animals, depraved. They kill to live, and they kill on sight because they know they'll be killed on sight. What've the Black Legs got to do with us? Chick Hainline is a Black Leg. But, but why all of us, like this? I told you, one of you let him out last night. Garner thought he might recognize her perfume, but since he can't... So what are you gonna do? Get you out of town, for good! - You can't do that, sheriff! - You wanna bet? Nothin' but trouble since you women showed up in Beecher. I say good riddance. I say let 'em stay, sheriff. We never had it so good. But how do you know one of us did it? How can you make us all suffer for what, for what you think one of us did? Does the one who let Chick Hainline loose want to confess? How do you know it was one of us? There are other women in town. Any one of them could've let him out. The girl who did this said she had a limited time off the floor. There's only one saloon in town, this one! This is wrong, and you know it. You're throwing us out of town because you're afraid. Go upstairs and get dressed. All of you. I'm giving you 15 minutes. Come on, girls. You'd think this was the first town we'd been asked to leave. Wait a minute! Which one of you? I was wondering myself. We've been accused of helping the Black Leg to escape. I don't believe any of us did it. But I'm going to ask for the truth. Who was it? Delilah? I wis. Sally? Of course not. Ruthie? I thought... You thought what? Well, that maybe... Oh, Jeanie... - Maybe what? - You. I never left this place last night, but one of us did. Which one? Ten minutes to pack, or I'll do it for you. Rig all set, Thorny? Set for what? Here. Somebody said they had a payload here for me. What is it? To drive these out of town. You mean, I'm supposed to drive? You're on the county payroll starting now, and you'll stay on it until you come back with that rig empty. I will. Did I thank you for the new stockings? I don't remember. If you ever come back here, you'll be coming back to jail. Oh, now, sheriff, couldn't we... I guess we couldn't. Well, how far do I have to take 'em? Till you find someplace that'll risk takin' 'em in. The farther, the better. Come on, girls. There're plenty of towns that'll be glad to have us bring a little sunshine into their lives. Why are you doing this, Mart? Go back inside! They're just girls, Mart. Real pretty, but just girls. I said go back inside! Listen, you cheap tin-star... I don't think we should stay if we're not wanted. I'll find a way to make you remember this. Maybe you already have. All right, Thorny, start traveling! Giddy up! I don't like to see 'em go. - What? - Three of 'em are innocent. The fourth, whichever one it is, is bringin' somethin' on us I don't even like to think about. That's as far as you go. We got a telegram about one of you letting Chick Hainline go. - We know what that means. - We have to stop somewhere. We got no room for you. We'll try the next town, Thorny. Won't do you no good. They been alerted about the Black Legs. I thought I knew each of you so well. But there's one of you I didn't get to know. I should dump the whole lot of you. We were thinking the same thing. About you! Whoa... Well, looks like we're gonna be here for a while. Will the one who let Chick Hainline out answer me one thing? Are the Black Legs liable to be ridin' along this road tonight? Come on. Come on down. - Oh. - Whoa... Whoa, boy! - Thorny... - Can't you hurry? Well, if you two would get off... ...that rock and help Thorny, we might get out of here. It ain't no use. Three of them spokes are busted anyways. Can I help? Howdy. Lookoklike you had some trouble. How'd you figure that out? It is kind of obvious, I guess. And it don't look like I can fix it here. How else can I help you? You haven't got a hot meal in your pocket? - Or a drink? - Or maybe a hot bath? Yeah, matter of fact, I have. - Have what? - All those things. Just down the road a couple of miles. I'm Dewey Crawford. My brother Lorn and I run the Star Valley Inn, the stage relay station in town. Like I say, if you're gonna be rescued, do it in style! Not much style. The town's kinda deserted. As a m mter of fact, it's been empty since the silver boom quit five years ago. A ghost town? Let' see, two of you can ride each of the team. - You can ride behind me. - Thanks. Well, let's get started. It's gettin' late. He's nice. I wonder what his brother's like? One of us has been accused of helping the Black Legs. And all you can think of is: "I wonder what his brother is like!" Lorn! Hey, you're never gonna guess what I brought home with me. Who does the team belong to? Well, they're part of it. I was out exercising King, and I come on this rig with a busted wheel, and you'd never guess what was inside of it. I'm afraid you'll have to tell me. Just four of the prettiest girls you ever saw in your life. Four girls? Yeah, and a driver. He's cookin' for us. Where are they? Well, they're upstairs. I gave them rooms. They're cleanin' up. Who are they? Where'd they come from? I was so flustered I plumb forgot to ask 'em. And you brought 'em back here? Well... sure, why not? What'd I tell you about strangers! Now, look, Lorn, we're not only runnin' a relay station for the stage, we're running an inn. And strangers are our business! Four girls! Now, what harm can they do? You want to tell me now? - About you? - I'll tell you nothing. I'm not saying these girls are bums, I'm saying... What, Lorn? I've just come from Millsville. Yeah... I heard one of these girls let Chick Hainline loose. - Who's Chick Hainline? - He's a Black Leg, which I hope you never hear anything about. Well, what is a Black Leg? Did you have anything to do with it during the war? Y'know, sometimes you... you mutter about it in your sleep, and you, you yell out about a man with a whip! I never did! And if I did, you forget I made mention of him. Is that what's the matter with you now? Is there anything the matter with me now? No, I, I guess not. These women... as soon as it's daylight, I'll ride out and see about this rig. They can stay, then? Long enough to eat, anyway. I'll call 'em. That was pretty good. I haven't eaten that good in a long time. Thorny's a better cook than Lorn. Oh... is he? Something wrong? Oh, I'll help the girls with the dishes in a minute, I just want to know... Know what? Why you've been treating us like we were intruders. - I didn't mean to. - I think you did. You hardly looked at us during dinner, let alone spoke to us. I was just wondering... Why are you stuck out here in this ghost town? I should think you'd like company. You, you don't look like you enjoy being a hermit. Don't I? Are you on the run? If I was on the run, I wouldn't pick a stage depot to hide in. Then you're not running. Everyone is from something. Take you... Don't take me. Who hit you? What? Were you young as I was, or was it last year, or, maybe a few months ago? I don't know what you mean. Somebody hit you hard and you're running. You seem to know a lot about running. And those are real fancy clothes for running. What difference does it make to you what I wear? No difference to me. You'll be leaving right away. Oh, look, can't we stay for just a little while? I'll have your rig patched up tomorrow, and you'll be on your way. Why? We've got money, we can pay. This place is empty. We have our regular business with the through stage. That's enough trouble. Is that all anything means to you? Avoiding trouble? That's right. Avoiding trouble and staying alive. And it makes no difference that other people who might have troubles they can't handle themselves, and need help? No difference at all. What kind of a man are you? Good night. You don't like loneliness, and yet you invite it. Did anyone ever tell you that loneliness is 95 percent fear? I said good night. Good night. Here he comes now. I was wonderin' if you'd be able to get it back alone. That's a pretty good job. Hey, now just a darn minute. What was that for? The next time you drag home a buckboard load of tramps without askin' me... - Tramps! - ...and take a chance on bringing them here... - Who's "them"? - The second I get that wheel slapped back together and on the rig, they're leaving here! You tell 'em, right now! You, c'mon, I'll need your help in the stable. There, I think those spokes ought to hold until you get to where you're going. Where is that? I don't know. Where were you headed for when it broke down? Go out and get a pole and get it under the axle and lift. When you get it up, I'll slip this on the hub. Right. - We weren't headed anywhere. - What? We weren't headed anywhere and you know it. I know it. Why do you think no town around here wants you? - Because you're bad girls? - Who judges? Not what you are, but what one of you did. You mean letting Chick Hainline loose? I don't want Chick Hainline following you here. Following me! You don't think I'm the one that let him... Chick Hainline means the Black Legs are around. They'll meet him, and when they do there's going to be trouble. How is it that you know about the Black Legs? How is it you don't ask what they are? I was told what they are. Then there's Dewey. He's young. He doesn't know much about women like you. It's just as well... What do you know about women like me? Do you think I chose this kind of life? Get the pole under the axle. I'd have been the last one on earth to let Chick Hainline loose. Why's that? He was with the guerillas, when they murdered my father and mother. - Where? - In Kansas... Lawrence. - Get out of here! - Why? Just get out, I've got my work to do. Why do you want me out? Why can't I watch you work? Is there a telegram saying I can't watch you fix a wheel? Just get out! I'll have your rig fixed in half an hour, and you'll be on your way, do you hear? Were you at Lawrence? Were you at the massacre? - Men, women, children... - I told you... Come on, we've got to get this fixed. What are you watching? I guess nothing, sir. Well, I guess we're about ready. Where's your brother? Didn't he have the nerve to say goodbye? Well, Lorn had to go to Millsville to pick up some feed. And left you to throw us out. Goodbye, Dewey. Thanks. It's a mite foolish, don't you think, wearin' a blue cap in this part of the country? That's right, sir... a mistake. Now if you don't mind, we'll... You ain't goin' no place, mister. None of you. Not yet awhile. Just a minute, mister. Now-now... Who are you, mister? And what do you want with us? You, you mean you don't know who I am? The Man with the Whip... ...John Murdock. Well, I'm, I'm delighted to meet you, ma'am. You're the Black Legs. Oh, what, what's left of 'em, but... We use to have a mighty fine little outfit, a spell back. Ain't you goin' to present me to the women-folk, Murdock? Oh, if you, um... if you ask me nice. Nice. This is Bill Lasatar. He's the ladies' man of our outfit. I've heard of you, too... ...in Kansas. Oh? Well, it looks like it's gonna be a fine night for a party, huh, boys? And we sure deserve one if any... if anybody ever did. Isn't that right? I even got The Fiddler with us. Now Fiddler, he... he don't talk much, you understand, but he sure makes that squeak box talk for him. Don't you, son? I hope they got plenty of liquor inside. Don't you girls? Well, come on, ladies. Let's get on with the party. And you, too, sonny. You take care of the horses, huh? Oh... Now, come on. You go on back there. Sit down. What're you doing? Wonderin' which one let Chick Hainline out, and brought them Black Legs here. I can't believe that one of those... How else did the Black Legs get here? And I'm wonderin' what happened to your brother. Yeah... Let me go! No! They'll kill you! Go ahead... I can let you draw it and point it at me, and you still wouldn't have a chance. ...out here, huh? Get him out of here. Little girl... he was one of my best men. Now, I just can't... I just can't let the one who killed him go on livin', hale and hearty, now, can I? Hello, John. Ohh... I might of known, if I lived long enough, and traveled far enough... Say, don't you remember your old pal? The... the schoolboy? Our tin soldier! I guess this was bound to happen sometime. Well... let me look at you. Lorn knows him. You look good! A couple of more worry lines maybe, but you're still the same tin soldier. Well, you all remember that General Lee sent him to us? To show Billy Quantrill and me how to soldier proper. That right, lieutenant? That's about it. Yeah, that's about it. Eh, you remember tin soldier gettin' sick all over the street? He, he couldn't stand the sight of blood. Yeah, war wasn't all like it was in the schoolbooks, huh? And then right, right about in the middle of it, when Billie and me looked for our teacher to show us how to fight, you know, we can't find him! He... he's high-tailin' off somewhere we, we never did see him again. - A deserter! So that's why. - Dewey... Sonny a friend of yours? He's my brother. Oh, little brother, huh? Where was it, that you were with Quantrill? Huh? Well, lemme see, that, that'd be Lawrence. Yeah, Lawrence. You were at Lawrence. And you don't approve of my kind of life. Well, come on, sit down, schoolboy! We, we got lots more to talk over. Aw, come on now, now, sit down. Here... Say, you, you... you remember that little James boy, Jesse? with the crooked finger, Yoe the one you said never would make a soldier? Well, you, you should've seen that boy in Centralia. You see, we caught a whole troop of Feds on foot, butchered 75 of 'em. Well, three of the bluecoats, they scurried off like a covey of quail. Young Jesse took out after 'em and... All three of 'em, just like that! It's him all right. Fiddler. I wondered when you'd get here, Chick. Hello, John. Well, it took a while to find out what we wanted. Especially with me on the run. - But you found out? - Yeah, I did. Good. Good. Well, Chick, you ea yrself a present. Wait'll you see what we got. Oh, girls... Oh, girls! Come on down here. All of ye! Why, hon! Well, I didn't know you'd be here. I didn't get a chance to thank you, sis. You, Ruthie! Yes... he's my brother... I couldn't let him hang. I'm sorry. We got a lot of plans to make, Murdock. Oh? When are they comin'? Tomorrow. Fine. You know, I was gettin' a little restless, holed up here. Even though the company's good. Hey... where's Lasatar? He was murdered, by little Sally up there. You know, I nearly forgot about that. How'd it happen? Well, Sally didn't like him... so she shot him. Oh, yeah? What've you done about it? Nothin'. There's plenty of time. What are you going to do? Mm, what... what'd you say? I said, "What are you going to do?" You're going to kill her, aren't you? Well, what else is there? Oh, no! You've killed hundreds of people. You murdered my mother and father back at Lawrence. Well, you're not going to murder anymore, because I'm going to kill you! Now... why does a pretty girl like you wanna talk like that? Especially when you know that you can't pull a trigger as fast as Fiddler, there! Oh, but, I... I admire you for tryin'. You're the kind of girl I like. The kind that fights back. Let go of her! Let go of her Murdock, or I'll kill you! With what? With my hands! You haven't got guts enough to give me a gun! Put that in your holster. - Don't be a fool. - In the holster! I'm countin' three. Do you think he'll give you time for that? What do you say, Murdock? He doesn't know you, John. Give him a chance. Now, nowowou just stay clear o' this, tin soldier. We wanna keep this a fair fight. Your own brother. Hey, John, you gonna need some help with this kid? You're calling the tune, little brother. Like I said, I'm countin' three. One... two... ...three! So you knew? That he'd make a fool of him? I knew. Any more ideas? Um, you, you didn't specify weapons, so I, I just naturally... How can you just stand there and let him get... Murdock won't kill him, and it's time he learned. Learned what? To be like you? Oh! Let me help. Let's have a drink, Chick, and then get on with it. Scat! Well, when are they comin'? On the noon stage. ] You've been here all night. I'm going downstairs to get some breakfast for Dewey. Wouldn't you like some, too? No, thanks. Answer me one thing: you're not a coward, are you? That's not what made you desert in the war, and let your brother down, is it? If you mean by "coward" am I concerned about my own skin? No. Yet you won't fight back. Why? You have to have a reason to fight. And you haven't anything? Nothing in the whole world? Stop it. How does a man get that way? He might as well be dead. I'll tell you how. He was sent to military school in Virginia. The war comes and the class ahead of his loses 90. Killed in action. They died willingly. They had a cause, a belief, more important than life itself. He tried to find that cause, make it his own. Did you? A blue army was moving South. The general was a man named Sherman. They did things... Well, he found a reason to fight. They were beasts, out to destroy everything in their path. They had to be driven back, cut to pieces. But it changed. The greatest man he ever met, I ever met, General Lee, decided to send a liaison officer to Missouri to coordinate the activities of a guerilla fighter named Quantrill. The beasts again, only worse, and now I was fighting with them, not against them. So what happened to the cause, belief? Maybe your father and mother could answer. I'm sorry. What's the answer? What turns a man into an animal, like our friend, John Murdock, downstairs? Fighting... It doesn't make any difference which side you're on. Pick up your sword or gun, and you turn back a thousand years. You're wrong! Oh, look, I, I can't explain it, but, but there are things worth fighting for, and you can't run away from them. Tin soldier, Murdock wants you downstairs. So the stage gets here at noon, and he'll be on it. You've told me everything except who'll be on it. So I have. So I have. You tell him, Chick. The new governor. And he'll have an escort, so we need your help to see he doesn't get suspicious. You'll meet that stage, same as always. What do you want with the governor? I want safe conduct across the border. I want a stake to get started. Maybe an extra little dividend on the side. And you think you'll get what you want? Don't you know who the new governor is? Harrison Andrews. General Harrison Andrews. He killed Quantrill. Why, so he did. Yes, that's just what he did. There's your breakfast. Hey! Take off that cap! You could never kidnap the governor and hold him alive. We know that. You'd have to kill him. Then what'll happen to the ransom and safe conduct? Well, we'll know that, but nobody else will, at least not until the ransom's paid, and we're safe across the border. That way we can't lose. Well, who knows, maybe I'll even get to use this on the man that murdered Quantrill. Well? Well... Well, you're gonna help us, because we've got ways of makin' you. Like little brother, and the girls? If I do it, they'll be safe? All of them, including Sally? You've got John Murdock's word. Come on, you wore a gray cap, even if you did cut and run. You ain't gonna tell us you love the big Yankee general? Well, you look a lot better than the last time I saw you. Thanks to Ruthie. And you know, I can understand why she didn't let on to you and the other girls about her brother bein' a Black Leg. Well, she didn't want you to think that she was one of them. You like her, don't you? Yeah. Who is it? Thorny. What's the matter? I just found out what they're up to. Murdock? And your brother, Dewey. You mean Lorn's working with Murdock? They holed up here to wait for the governor. They're gonna kill him. - Oh, no. No, they can't! - We can't let 'em. - You stay quiet. - But I'm all right. Is Lorn with them now? They're gettin' it all worked out. - Jeanie! - You stay here. I've been waiting to talk to you. Where's Murdock? Out with the rest, hiding the horses, getting ready. What'd you want to say to me? Have you got it all planned? How you're going to kill the governor? Thorny heard you. You can't do it, you just can't do it! What difference does it make, whether I do or I don't. I can't save the governor alone. This way there's a chance for you and the other girls. You think Murdock's going to leave witnesses behind, alive? No, I don't. But this way he might. It's not worth it. My life isn't worth that to me. You believe in fighting for lost causes, even when you know they're lost? If they're right, yes. I never found one that was. I have, for the first time in my life... you. I've fallen in love with you, the last man on earth I'd want to love. And there's nothing I can do about it. I'm sorry for you. Oh, don't be sorry. You didn't do it, I did. I saw you out there in the barn, trying to fix that wheel, and needing somebody as much as anybody was ever needed. The first time in my life! And it has to be with you. Now you see it isn't worth it. Hey, what... What's that gonna prove? At least it would keep you from helping Murdock! Stop it, Jeanie! Stop it! It's near time. Murdock says to get ready. Inside, little brother. You didn't know little brother was well enough to try and warn the governor, did you? No, I didn't. Well... To tell you the truth, neither did I. But I know this, if you try anything, little brother and all those girls will go in a matter of seconds. Now they don't know this, so that puts you in a pretty bad light now, doesn't it? Hm? Fiddler... Fiddler, lock all the girls up in one room, hm? And put little brother in there, too. What about your promise to let Dewey and the girls go? Well, let's wait'll the governor gets here. We'll see what happens then. Stage comin'! Hey, it's a couple of minutes early. All right, come on, get ready, all of ya! Get this thing outta here. Stay right there! All right. Now your job is to get him outta that stage and in here. And that's all. Well, come on! Hello, governor. Don't open the door, governor. Act normal but don't get out. You men, make it look like I'm not talkin' to you. John Murdock and his Black Legs are inside, governor. They mean to capture you, hold you till they get the money they want, then kill you and cross the border. Don't look at me! Wipe your necks, complain about the heat. You, sir, point your finger like you're asking me how far it is and how much longer it'll take. While you're doin' it, I'll tell you what to do. You're taking a lot on yourself, young man. I remember the man with the whip. What are they doin' out there? Why ain't the governor comin' in here? Why aren't they changin' horses? Well, inspectin' the stage is normal. He's just bein' smart... I think. Give the tin soldier more time. Twenty seconds. Driver, when I yell, you use that whip and you get out of here faster than you think you can. They'll fire from the first floor window. You fire back as you go, it may slow 'em up a bit. What happens to you? Just do as I say, sir... You ready? All right, now! Cut 'em down! Governor! Behind the trough! Now hold your fire! Murdock's gonna try something. Hey, tin soldier! I'm sendin' out four unarmed men! You hear? Unarmed! But don't shoot at 'em, they're gonna bring you and the general back here for a talk, just a talk, you understand? Don't send 'em, or we'll shoot 'em down. Do you hear? No, you won't! Not if they're not armed! I'm sendin' 'em, so don't shoot! Now, now when you get close enough, use your revolvers, but try to save 'em both if you can, 'cause we need the governor alive. That other one... I want. Shoot 'em down. No! They're unarmed. You can see. - Let me talk to them. - Talk to them?! I thought I told you about that! Your excellency. We just... came over here to... ...talk. Come on... Shoot that posse down! Hold it... Hold it! Sheriff Persons, Beecher City, Your Honor. Sorry we couldn't get here sooner. I'd call your arrival most timely, sheriff. - How come you got here? - - Who are you? I run that inn. I stationed a man outside of here. Thought wherever those girls I kicked out of Beecher went, Chick Hainline would go. Wherever he went, the Black Legs would come. When they showed up my man had to find me. I was beatin' about the country. He didn't know about the governor coming. Neither did I. Got here as soon as we could. My thanks, sheriff. Don't know how much help I've been, but at least you're safe, sir. You can be a lot of help. Get his excellency out the back way to wherever you left your horses. What about you, young man, and those girls in there? The important thing is you, sir. I'll manage the... Hey, tin soldier. Don't you remember who's upstairs? Little brother, and those poor beautiful, defenseless girls. They all want so much to live. But they won't. They won't, tin soldier, unless you and that... ...governor out there come in and talk to me. You understand? Um, unarmed, of course, just as I'll be. Sheriff, get the governor out of here. Your brother's in there. Murdock will kill him. Maybe not. - And those girls. - - They're just... I said get started, sheriff. Let's go, Your Honor. You got ten seconds, tin soldier! I said, get started! Just a minute! I'll give the orders here. There's a madman in there. I remember him. There are also people in there who risked their lives to save mine. I'm not being foolhardy when I say you and I are going in there, young man. We've got the sheriff's men to cover us. You demand of Murdock that he send all of his men out into the open before we set foot inside that inn. Now that's an order. You carry it out! Yes, sir. We're coming in, Murdock. Unarmed. But first send all your men outside. - Do you understand? - Yeah, that's fair enough. All right, outside, all of you! They aren't comin' in unless you do! Come on, outside, all of you! You, too! All right, sir. Well... I'm delighted to see you again, general. Your excellency. Eh, bolt that door there, tin soldier. Oh, they're all up there, safe and sound... ...so far. State your requests, Murdock. Well, I'm delighted that you remember my name, sir. I remember hearing reports about you and your whip. Well, here it is. I'm unarmed, except for it... ...general.
