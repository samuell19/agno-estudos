On Tuesday, January 20th, 1942 at a house in the quiet Berlin suburb, Wannsee, a meeting was held. THE WANNSEE CONFERENCE. At the invitation Reinhard Heydrich, head of the security police and secret service, 14 key representatives of the Nazi party, of the SS, and the Government bureaucracy attended. The meeting lasted just 90 minutes. There was only one item on the agenda. Heil Hitler. - Heil Hitler! Herr Gauleiter, I’m Obersturmbannführer Eichmann. I'd like to welcome you. Why were we ordered here to Interpol? Are we to be arrested for stealing silverware? Obergruppenführer Heydrich, Chief of Interpol, is also in charge here. The conference rooms are suitable. - For eavesdropping. We must watch what we say. I'm glad to be here. I get lost at Headquarters. Looks like the shack of a Wannsee Jew. Aryanized some time ago. - Very fitting for the occasion. Everyone has arrived, except the Reichsprotector himself. His departure was delayed due to fog. Is Heydrich flying his own plane? He has already landed. We expect him momentarily. Well, well, the Ministry of the East! Back in Berlin again. How are our beautiful Baltic provinces? Could be better. Problem with the gas trucks. Watch what you're saying. - Nonsense! There are no blabbermouths here. Your race expert bit off more than he could chew. He said he didn’t need those trucks anymore. So now we get Jews from all over the Reich. Aus Stuttgart, Köln, Munich, aus Berlin. Old hags and kids. Rabble unfit to work. Ghettoes are bursting at the seams again. In Riga we had 15 thousand... Are we just going to write off the East? We put in n good word for you with the Führer. That's the best we can do. - There are more important operations. We're always getting dumped on! - Pull yourself together. At ease. It's in your own interest to send the Jews someplace else. You're getting very few as it is. - 25,000 since October! Most are being held in Lodz. The army needs the railroad cars. Lodz is already overloaded. We must make more room. We have to ship them out to finish the job. The trucks are used around the clock. - Then build more! By spring we'll look much better. More elegant. Are you the hunchback of Notre Dame? Just reporting on my prison inspection. Hellish mutations. Whatever happened to racial purity? They should be looked over and weeded out. Headquarters has always maintained that convicts belong in the camps. The Reichsführer-SS is solely responsible for anti-social elements. What's right is what is good for the people. Nobody understands that, not even the Ministry of Justice. Don't look at me, comrade. I'm an old National Socialist, too. I'm far from a bleeding heart. The National Court of Justice needs a new president. The Reichsführer wants a “no ifs, ands or buts" person. Dr. Freisler? I'd rather keep a low profile. I was just explaining our policy on Jews to this charming lady. It's interesting for me. - What did you call it? Privileged mixed marriage. - In privileged mixed marriages... Which don't fall under the special Jewish measures. Childless mixed marriages are privileged if the man is Aryan. If he’s a Jew, they’re not. - I don't understand. We proceed on the basis of the Nuremberg Laws which the male determines the racial character of the offspring. And if there are children? - Only privileged if they are not raised as Jews. Even if the father is Aryan? - Yes. - I'm lost again. An Aryan father's belief in the Jewish faith outweighs his Aryan blood. He’s considered a Jew and treated as a Jew. Now you're applying religious distinctions rather than racial ones. It isn’t quite that simple. - No? Don’t feel bad. It took me six years of toil and sweat to formulate our Jewish laws and understand them. I still don’t understand them. Gruppenführer, a minor problem. - Yes, Stadtsekretär, with the Gestapo? Actually with Eichmann, your Jew specialist. He includes half-Jews and mixed- marriage Jews in the Jewish measures. I'm getting complaints about the interrogations. Your Jew specialist interrogates in the presence of shady characters from the SS whose roles aren’t clear unless it's —how should I put it — to intimidate. They just sit there, waiting for a signal. - Signal? To jump in. Can't that be stopped? It doesn't improve the atmosphere. Let me put your mind at ease. Just agree to tighten up certain Jewish measures today and the rest will be superfluous. - Well, we’ll see. I see you finally got an SS tuxedo. As an honorary SS officer, I mustn’t embarrass the Reichsführer. But as the Reichsführer says, "It takes more than just trappings." Telephone call from Riga for you. Tell me. Must my reports on the liquidations be circulated by the dozens? “Top Secret" should restrict them. - You want to keep secrets here? I need another drink. It's damn cold out. Our poor men outside Moscow. I can't return wrecked cars to the railroad! What? How can I negotiate for more trains if we return them in pieces? Take care of it! I'm holding you personally responsible. I expect a report on what you've done in one hour! The train leaves on schedule at 17:16 or you lose your stripes! Is that clear? There's a problem, sir. - Riga? During the unloading of the 1500 Viennese Jews who arrived for relocation. Compartment windows were broken, sir. - An escape attempt? No. They wanted the ice from the inside of the windows. Or so it seems. - Why? They were thirsty. And that's not the worst. Corpses, frozen to their seats. The escort squad simply yanked them up. And the boards along with them. Substantial damage. Is an Obersturmbannführer in the SS the same as a Major in the Army? - Yes. You're a Colonel? - Not quite. Lieutenant Colonel. And you? A General? - No Lieutenant General. The Reichsprotector is a General. - And a Staatssekretär is a Deputy Minister? Not quite. - There's a lot of top brass here today. - Glad to announce that. Attention! Heil Hitler! Please adjourn to the conference room. Müller, Eichmann, Lange, with me. And the Secretary of Foreign Affairs. Sit! Stay, Hasso! I'll be right back. Forgive me, but my time is divided between Prague and Berlin. I understand. I hear we've got the go-ahead. I have some privileged information you might want for your report to the Foreign Minister. I was present at a meeting. between the Führer and the Reichsführer-SS. The Führer feels the Jews have lost their value as hostages. America's entry into the war changes everything. The Jews have now surrounded the Reich. The Führer is especially disappointed in England. He hoped they would acknowledge our legitimate requests - Living space in the East, appropriate status in Europe solution of the Jewish question through emigration. We could have reached an agreement. We are of the same race. The Jews have taken over Downing Street as well. The Führer has lost all patience. Why spare our Jews when we pre obliged to settle accounts with world Jewry? This is the situation right now. - I fully understand. The responsibility lies in foreign hands. Why did no one take our Jews when there was still time? Why boycott our emigration programs? A Jewish state in Palestine is no more desirable to England than to us. We can't risk upsetting the Grand Mufti the Führer’s Arab ally. But Madagascar should have been acceptable. The Jews have only themselves to blame. I understand why the Führer is making them pay. They've amassed a huge debt. One day the world will thank us. But maybe it will wake up and listen to reason when we deport the “Chosen People" en masse to the East. Maybe it will strike terror in the hearts of Roosevelt and Churchill. As the Führer says, "It's good if terror leads our way — the terror that we will exterminate the Jews." Now please excuse us. Everything okay with the Gestapo here? Yes, sir. What about... - Taken care of. Keep it quiet. Its very nature camouflages it. And why, gentlemen? Because no one can imagine it. - I could say, Obergruppenführer... Naturally, something always leaks out in matters of such magnitude. Being informed, within limits, can't hurt our good citizens. Shared knowledge means shared responsibility. Shared responsibility means shared liability. - Very elegant. Do you have the documents? - Yes, herr Gruppenführer. Good to see you. What's new in Riga? Good flight? Apart from my dog puking all over the plane, fine. Does the dog always come along? - He wanted a vacation. You have the latest task force report? Brigadeführer Stahlecker and the SS Commander in the East authorized me to report: Estonia, Jew-free! Latvia and Lithuania, Jew-free except for work Jews! Congratulations. Excellent. With all due respect, sir, my comrades took the liberty of drawing up a chart of the quotas filled. In Task Force Group A, we've reached 220,000. I want take a look to the documents. - The other groups combined total 500,000. We're getting there. You’re trembling. Too much booze? - That’s part of it. There are ladies in Berlin who can take care of you. Why only 40,000 in White Russia? The area is just too large. Not enough trucks or gasoline. The ground is frozen so we can’t dig more mass graves which means we can't shoot. And you'll be getting shipments from the Reich. We didn't really plan on starting up again. You'll be getting special trucks. Asphyxiation through exhaust fumes. I've heard about this from an SS Commander. He says it's messier than shooting. Hard to believe. What's your opinion, Eichmann? Eichmann puked like Lange's dog. - What was matter? Things went wrong. I was an eyewitness. While unloading the trucks... ...we saw that the exhaust fumes weren't completely effective. Some were dead, some half dead, some alive. It was, if I may say so, not a very pleasant situation. Who said it would be pleasant? - Slip-ups happen. There were women, children and elderly among them. They’re Jews too aren't they? It's been resolved. A minor technical problem. The carbon monoxide was burning off before reaching the back of the truck. Eichmann, it seems you handled it quite well. I want to tell you something. The Reichsführer-SS himself fainted during an execution. Nothing dishonorable in that. It proves we Germans are human. But it is dishonorable not to carry out what the future of our people demand, whether it is pleasant or not. It is dishonorable to be a weakling which we in the SS are not. I recommend. we relieve Eichmann from future inspections of gas operations. Theoretically, we’ve worked it all out. - Where do we stand? Herr Gruppenführer, first – executions. Appropriate near the front, but technically and psychologically bad for the final solution. Second - special vehicles. The same. Third: stationary exhaust units. Fourth – Zyklon-B. Initial results in Auschwitz - promising. - A battle of beliefs has broken out. Wirth swears by engine exhaust, Hoss by Zyklon-B. It's a pesticide gas. - I'll suggest to the Reichsführer to continue on all four. Competition's good for business. So, gentelmen. A word, herr Gruppenführer. - Yes? - There have been some complaints. - Yes, and? Certain district commissioners... - Who? Gauleiter Kube, for example. They treat us like scum. Why so sensitive? - It's no fun to be sneered at by bloated bureaucrats in party uniform who keep favored Jews for their manicures, haircuts and laundry. Just because our work disturbs their peace of mind they sit high and dry and gripe about our “barbarity" and "sadism." They say that it's unworthy of the Germany of Kant and Goethe. That my men lust after executions! And that from a man who roams the Minsk ghetto looking for Jewish beauties for his private pleasure. I would like to ask if we, who are only doing our duty, must put up with such mudslingers? Let them talk. That’s not the point. We have personnel from the earlier administration: Bureaucrats, yes-men, civil servants as well as old school conservatives, romantic nationalists, etc. We harness these questionable elements and party members and force them share responsibility or stumble into it. That goes for Kube, too. He differentiates between first-class Jews, who should be spared and second-class Jews, cultured Jews and subhumans. That’s not the Führer's idea. - Totally impractical. If you take one, you take them all. And that’s their pitfall. Clear? - Yes, herr Obergruppenführer. They have no choice. If said A, then said B. And that’s our purpose today. Orderlies reliable? - Hand-picked. Let’s go deal with these bureaucrats. Password? - Suckers.- March! Excuse me, Gauleiter. - Shall we move down? A problem, gentlemen? Unless you’re superstitious, please sit at the head of the table. That way the Reich Chancellery can keep an eye on us. We've neglected the young lady. Please sit over there. It will make your job easier, and it will add a nice touch to our circle. Can’t you shut him up? - I will try, herr Obergruppenführer. It could end up in the minutes. Thank you gentelmen. Would you like the minutes verbatim? A detailed account will suffice. Herr Gauleiter, Staatssekretäre, Reichsunsleiter # I want to thank you for accepting my invitation on such short notice. The reason for this meeting is explained in a letter from the Reichsmarshall, a copy of which was enclosed with your invitation. - Yes, it is. I’ll quickly read you the letter. Berlin, July 31, 1941. The Reichsmarshall, Commissioner of the Four-Year Plan Chairman of the Council for National Defense. To: Chief of the Security Police SS-Gruppenführer Heydrich, Berlin. Obergruppenführer. - Excuse me? - Obergruppenführer Heydrich. Not at the time. "In addition to your regular duties," etc. "I hereby instruct you to take all necessary steps... I’ll work out the details. ...toward a solution to the Jewish question in Europe and to submit a complete outline for the implementation of the final solution. Since other authorities will be affected by this they should be included." In other words, gentlemen, you. Signed, Goering. Peace at last. Please attach a copy to the minutes. Is there a special reason, Herr Reichsprotector... - Deputy. why you waited half a year to execute this letter dated last July? - Three reasons. The preparations were extremely complicated and interfered with my duties as Deputy Reichsprotector of Bohemia and Moravia. An earlier meeting was cancelled when America entered the war and new demands were placed on my departments. The reason I'm, asking is, your invitation says: "In view of the importance of these questions and in the interest of reaching solution I propose, in order to coordinate our efforts that these problems be discussed, especially in view of the fact" and this is my point - that since October 15th there has been a constant flow of Jews from the Reich territories including Bohemia and Moravia evacuated to the East." Yes? - These transports particularly from Berlin have caused the Reich Chancellery increasing embarrassment. There have been rumors about the special treatment of evacuees in the East. These rumors have lead to 208 suicides among Jews designated for deportation. On the other hand the offices involved were not able to provide any information. Nor could we expect an explanation from the Führer under the circumstances. We are living in turbulent times. Our meeting here today is a sign of our "good will." What did you do with him? - I gave him his rations. Plenty of everything here. Concerning the Berlin Jews... Why don’t they believe they're being sent to labor camps in the East? Do they know what actually awaits them? That’s why they’re jumping out of windows. But what do their neighbors and friends say? Imagine the gossip! Another reason to rapidly eliminate this problem. That would be advisable. Jewish suicides have given the Foreign Office headaches. The foreign press picked it up. And there were other problems, such as transporting Jews... holding foreign passports. Slip-ups happen. - Tell that to an ambassador And we should stop including Jews from mixed marriages in these operations. It's a mistake. And the Ministry finds it regrettable. These are teething problems, which should not continue. - Steps have been taken. Since we're on the subject... - The more the merrier. The Reichsmarshall, as head of the Four Year Plan is against deporting armament workers. He says you’re not playing by the rules. It seems to me that he complains today yet welcomes it tomorrow. It’s not easy, especially when there’s a conflict of authority. It is crucial that we clear up the question of leadership now. It's always difficult in dear old Berlin to agree on who is responsible for what. I don't understand why everybody wants responsibility. It only means more work. But that is a basic German flaw. - Virtue. As you please. All joking aside I declare categorically - leadership will lie exclusively with Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler. And under him my humble self. Do you have that in writing? From the hand of the Führer. Obviously, such far-reaching measures could not be taken without prior authorization. The Führer's word weighs more than any paper. If after this meeting you can name anyone who is in a position to carry out the planned solution... in an orderly and decent manner I'll be the first to say, “Be my guest." We have two and a half million Jews in the General Province. A major and complex problem in what was formerly Poland. Am I to report to the Governor General.. that you will be encroaching on his authority? We’re taking over your problem. We're getting it off your back. It will quickly disappear and you’ll thank us. Then your authority will extend to all departments in the East. Correct! But mutual cooperation is essential. Are you listening? Right. The Governor General does not oppose uncompromising action either in the question of the Poles or the Jews as I am sure the SS and the Secret Service will confirm. The problem is just... Only recently the Ministry of the East gave him the advice to "liquidate them yourself." We in the East cannot take the Jews off his hands. We have too many, in spite of the work of the task forces. It isn't as if the Governor General had reservations about a final solution the question. In our briefing before I came here, he stressed his willingness to make the General Province Jew-free in accordance with the measures decided on by the Reich. It's a matter of controlling the “large number of parasites in Poland, " as he put it. It is a question of procedure. - Precisely! We have answered question of procedure. We have the means, the methods the organization, the experience and the people and the determination We are today at a historical moment in our battle against Jewry! Four times the Führer has broadcast his determination to collect the Jewish debt owed to the German people by eradicating Jewry in Europe. The Führer sees himself as the Robert Koch of politics eradicating the bacteria to save the organism. Question is: "It's either them or us." What has happened so far? Let me recapitulate: A) Through comprehensive Jewish statutes Jews have been methodically expelled without mercy from all walks of German life. B) We have pushed them out of the living space of the German people mainly interning them in concentration camps. On the other hand with special thanks to the abilities of Eichmann we have, while fighting the war motivated 537,000 Jews to leave. C) In the East, since the beginning of the war, we have brought about the physical annihilation of 100,000 Polish, Baltic and Russian Jews. You of the Party the Reich Chancellery the Foreign Office the Ministry for the East and the General Province were kept informed by the reports of our task forces which were supplied to you by the Gestapo. I’d like to welcome the Commander of the Security Police in Latvia SS-Sturmbannführer Dr. Lange. Coming from the northern area of operations... he has been instrumental in the activities carried out so far. On behalf of all of us I want to express our appreciation and esteem to Comrade Lange. Experience was gained in these and other operations that will be enormous significance in the forthcoming final solution. The Reichsführer-SS has forbidden any further emigration of Jews. Those Jews remaining in the Reich as well as all European Jews in our present and future sphere of influence... will lie evacuated to the East and subjected to the final solution. Such as the Russian Jews? - One might say that. Does that mean we’re getting Jews from other European countries? You'll have to concentrate on Jews from the East as the front advances. Does that apply to all task forces? Yes. You can pass some Jews on to the final solution sites. Do I understand correctly? So the Eastern Provinces won't be the site of the final solution? Well, not everybody can reap the laurels, gentlemen. So we’re the final solution site? Some of it will take place in the Eastern Provinces. Where? - In the boondocks. Primarily around Lublin. - Under the direction of Schöngarth? - You didn't tell me. - I didn't know. That would impinge on the Governor General’s responsibility as granted by the Führer. You are, by no means, in charge. An SS Commander and a Police chief will be in charge. And they will report directly to the Reichsführer-SS. Obergruppenführer Globocnik was seen in Lublin. - You saw correctly. Large-scale construction is going on, but we are denied access. Could be. - In view of the magnitude of the operations... You won't be, affected. We plan to proceed quickly, efficiently and quietly. The highest offices expect absolute cooperation in this vital matter. A brief demographic and geographic survey to show what we're dealing with regarding the Jews in Europe. We have a map with the Reich territory before the war in red. Here, the present front in the East. In white, conquered territories under our civil administration. In pink annexed territories. In red vertical lines, European areas occupied by our armies. Finally, in red horizontal lines our allies and countries in our sphere of influence. What we see scattered over the entire map like fly specks illustrates the density of the Jewish population. That is what we are faced with today. The further we advanced in this area between Riga and Odessa the denser the concentration of the Jewish enemy. These little lords and masters have really taken over. In my hometown of Odessa alone, there are 70,000 Jewish inhabitants. I'm sorry, what? - There used to be. Of course. To be brief, our task forces following hard on the heels of our troops have practically eliminated this concentration of Jews in one swoop. With some prodding, we used the anti-Semitism of the local population. - Strike that, please. Success seems almost inconceivable. How big is a task force? How does it work? Comrade Lange. Be brief, please. Four task forces of 1,000 men each. Composition - Waffen SS, SS Reserves, Gestapo, Kripo, Secret Service, SD. Two dozen female employees. The groups operate in squads. Success depends on a combination of organization, deception and an uncompromising will to destroy. An enormous emotional strain. It’s not a piece of cake, but orders are orders. We are now shifting from the casual to the precise. Sot we depend on harmonious cooperation. Harmonious? - We're counting on you. In regards to the final solution as a whole we are counting on you as well, Mr. Secretary. What needs to be solved will be solved here in the asshole of the world as my men say. Under the cloak of war, obscured by the smoke of gunpowder a lot of unusual things are possible. The Reichsführer-SS wants the resolution of the Jewish question to take place in one clean sweep. And the number of Jews affected amounts, all in all, to 11 million! So, 11 million. I beg your pardon. - I hope you were less clumsy with these figures. Eleven million. The breakdown is as follows: In the Reich proper, 130,000 remaining. Austria: 43,000. Protectorate: 75,000. Total USSR: the biggest chunk, 5 million. In the General Province: 2.5 million. Large numbers in the Balkans. Let's see, about... ...about 1.6 million. In the West, occupied France, for example, 165,000. Unoccupied France, a nice little chunk: 740,000. In view of the imminent total reorganization of Europe we also have figures for unoccupied countries such as England: 330,000. And neutral countries, such as Switzerland with 18,000 members of the “Chosen People." What contamination! - That’s terrible. Not for long. A question. Where are the figures? Here are the charts. - Thank you. Whose figures are those? - From the Jewish Commission of the State Police. At Eichmann’s request, the Foreign Office also contributed. Is the data reliable? - It's pretty close, Mr. Minister. What lies ahead is an organizational task unparalleled in history. How is it to be done? In the course of orderly execution Europe will be combed from west to east. Jews will be placed in collection camps, then load by load evacuated to the East and delivered to their proper destiny. About transportation. The problem of mobilization... Won't transporting millions hinder the army? That's already a headache. - At a moment when we’re faced with military problems on the Eastern front do the SS, Gestapo, Reich and local police have priority over the combat troops? I’m thinking about the supply and relief problems which my son, a staff officer, told me about. Mr. Minister, it is not a question of priorities. The steps toward a final solution are as important as all other war efforts. We are fighting internal and external enemies. It isn’t a luxury in which we're indulging. Wherever we fight the Jew, we are fighting for the Reich! I do not doubt that everyone present agrees with you wholeheartedly. There isn't a staff problem because we only need a handful of people. But regarding transportation on which everything depends, perhaps my Jew specialist, Eichmann can fill you in. He is our shipping agent, so to speak. Cognac! Your report please. Be brief. My duties as Jew specialist in Office IV-B4 of the Gestapo in the Reich Central Security Office include the power to seize and transport Jews. In accordance with the successful methods used in the Reich seizure by local authorities and the Gestapo is as follows: Once a Jew is detected registered and segregated, he is arrested. He hands over his house keys and signs over his possessions to the Reich. Then with one suitcase and 50 marks in cash he proceeds to a remote railroad junction where he is loaded on board. Transportation requires joint coordination by the Ministry of Transportation the Army and the Railroads Timetable Commission. For better surveillance by the escort personnel we prefer freight cars. Seizure and transportation are subject to consideration of the capacity of the destinations in the East whether ghettoes, work camps, transit camps or, in the end, direct operations. Transportation will not be curtailed. We claim only freight cars carrying Russian civilian worker's which would otherwise return empty. In effect, an exchange takes place: A Russian for a Jew, a Jew for a Russian. However, for the sake of appearances we also include passenger trains up to the Reich border. Gesundheit, gentelmen! Now we know where one can still live in luxury. They say your private wine cellar isn't exactly empty. Why should it be? Why don't you come visit me? Come and visit. - I have one question. Why do the Jews agree to turn over their property to the Reich? Proper procedure. They must forfeit their possessions anyway when crossing the border. - But their exit isn't exactly voluntary. Psychological reasons, too. Formalities are more soothing, more elegant. As for the effects on the economy, not much would be gained if we bring in masses of unskilled foreign laborers ...and kick out skilled Jewish armament workers.. If they are of use to us they can stay. Privileged status for Jewish armament workers. I would like those comments in the minutes. - Yes, herr Obergruppenführer. Would you like to work for me in Prague? You're pleasing to the eye. - Thank you, Obergruppenführer. I'll have to think about it. - Do that. The second question, Obergruppenführer. - Yes, please. About the Aryanization of Jewish property... It was appropriated for the Four-Year Plan. What will happen with their remaining assets? It's a tidy sum. We use it to finance our operations, which are costly. Goering, Himmler and the Minister of Finance will be discussing it. Just a moment gentlemen. I feel a bit overwhelmed. I see you're about to divide up the cake. I'd like to know how you intend to bake it. Why? - What I don’t know won't hunt me. I'd be happy to answer your question. In the final solution we will use Jews in the East as a supervised labor pool. We will march them, separated by sex, of course, in large work gangs. While building roads into those areas we’ll have them breaking rocks, drying swamps. And we’ll also give them an opportunity in huge industrial complexes which the SS Economic Office is building there to find out what it means to really work. Splendid. It's inconceivable that our men should freeze in the Russian winter while Israel and Sarah lead a life of leisure in concentration camp resorts. Of course, a large portion of these Jews will be eliminated through natural causes. The strongest ones will have to be dealt with appropriately. Because these, natural selection would be the seeds of a new Jewish resurgence. Look at the lessons of history. But now we're writing history, not the Jews. And in the future the Jew will no longer appear in it. He will exit the, stage. - Leaving the world in peace. I'm impressed. A new perspective. A revolutionary solution! Worthy of all the glorious visions of the Führer. Yet all this now? Front-line battles! Prisoners of war! Foreign workers! And now Jews! Isn't it too much? - We'll take on even more. Solving the Jewish problem is one thing. The reorganization of Europe is another. We're right in the middle. In Poland, what has happened? Liquidations! Polish intelligentsia, teachers, clergy, nobility, etc. have been eliminated to a large extent. This will continue in cooperation with local authorities. What is planned? 1) Population exchange. Open up western Poland to 10 million Reich and repatriated Germans. The rest of Poland, ditto, for future German settlement. 2) Germanization. The Race and Settlement Office sorts Poles into four categories. The majority will vanish alongside the Jews. A minority will be used as a labor force for those construction projects with which the Führer will imprint forever the stamp of German culture on the new Europe. 3) Finally, annihilation. Birth control will strike at the roots of what's left so that they wither and die. Finish the Poland. Telephone. The Reichsführer-SS at Headquarters. Gentlemen, we still have two complex topics to discuss. Since these will not concern all of you I suggest we refresh ourselves with a small, informal buffet. Neat and clean. I like that. An historic day. - And we were there. It's going well, isn't it? - Elegantly. It's all so unexpected. Snap decisions, the Führer's strong point. How can the Province cope with these masses of Jews? What do you care? Is it your business? These people have to be housed and fed. Our crops go to the Reich. Don ask me, Mr. Secretary. I only make the deliveries. What are you saying? - The Gestapo has nothing to do with it. And neither do you. - Me? No. Our ghettoes are overcrowded. Half a million crammed into one in Warsaw. We can’t feed them. They’re dying like flies. 20,000 in a single year. But that, dear colleague, should be the least of your worries. Epidemics don't ask whether you're a Jew or an Aryan. Seal off the ghettoes. - Done. But some Jews work outside the ghettoes. Why get excited? These problems will be taken off your hands. The Foreign Office gets rid of them and dumps them on us! Don't attack me. If not for me, your problems would be bigger. Ah, ok? - Yes. You'd now have Jews from Serbia, for example. We were supposed to get them? - 8,000 men. Lucky for you we found another solution. Eichmann's idea. The army needed hostages after partisan attacks. We said, "Help yourself." Jews as hostages for Serbian partisans? Is that true? - Jew or partisan, it's the same. And all 8,000, you.. The army command set a quota: 200 hostage for each soldier murdered. So there weren't even enough. It was tough for us. Conflicts of authority. Quite a fuss abroad, too. Even the Vatican stepped in. Vatican, the Nuncio. He comes and beats around the bush: "Wouldn't a discussion about shooting hostages in Belgrade be fruitful?" The Foreign Office replied that of all foreign authorities, the Vatican had behaved most sensibly. - How so? By simply not acknowledging it. - And the Nuncio? The Nuncio didn't want to touch the matter. Nor does he want Fi to do so in the future. For God's sake, no! Gentlemen, please be brief. My time is limited. I want to address the problem of foreign Jews and their treatment and of half-breeds and mixed marriages. It would be helpful to inform the Reich Chancellery firsthand. Have interoffice arrangements been made? We at Section III have been instructed by the Foreign Minister to work closely together with Gestapo Office IV-B4. As Jew specialist of the Gestapo, I’m already in regular contact with the Jew specialist from G-III. - What are the particulars? We distinguish between foreign Jews in the Reich foreign Jews in countries under German jurisdiction and foreign Jews in countries friendly to us. Regarding foreign Jews in the Reich - How many are there? 40,000. With regard to these people the Foreign Minister agreed no notice will be taken of protests by governments of those countries with which we are at war including the USA. Good. In the minutes? - As for Jews in the Reich from countries friendly to us for reasons of courtesy we queried the governments if they agreed to the deportation of these Jews. I’ll bet you they did. Affirmative replies have, been from Rumania, Croatia and Slovakia. Bulgaria is joining in. Slovakia, however claims their Jews' property. Money is money. - We replied? It's contingent on approval by the Four-Year Plan officer. To ease deportation, the Reichsmarshall will agree especially since it probably doesn’t involve a lot of money. Even pennies add up. So the Jews living in the Reich from these countries can be cleared out? Yes, herr Obergruppenführer. - And the Jews areas under German jurisdiction? Eastern Jews are at the discretion of the Reichsführer-SS. Just for clarification... Do the Security Police Commanders and Secret Service work with him? - You never give up. You'll have enough to do. Remaining Jews, work Jews, partisans, Polacks, etc. I’m not complaining. - Don't rejoice yet. You still have a lot to do. May I ask a question? What is to be done with the Jews in the other occupied territories? - Instructions are forthcoming. We first have to deal with the Jews who escaped from the Reich. 40,000 in France alone. Oh, my God, we've got them back! - The price of victory. But this time all we get from it is a few cardboard suitcases. They’ve already been interned in occupied and unoccupied France. We have access to both. - No resistance from the military, ambassadors, or French people. They have no idea of the nature of the final solution? How could they? - That's the official dictum. And Jews living in occupied territories? - There are still some problems. There's been flak from the military commander about the French Jews. He's afraid of riots. I had sharp words with the High Commander, and we agreed: Free rein on all Jewish matters in France. Eichmann? Understood. The other countries? Holland? - Nothing worth mentioning. Belgium? - Taken care of. - Luxemburg? - No problem. Greece? - It can be done. - Serbia? We’d like to solve the problem of the remaining Serbian Jews. Serbia would be the first Jew-free country. The second. Allow me to report: Estonia — Jew-free, aready reported. - You've already...? - We are informed. I should report what we're doing. It is our territory! - But our business. Will we get... - Copies of reports go to all central authorities. A Jew-free Serbia? Interesting. - Aryanization Is complete. Ghettoization has taken place. - Small numbers. 20,000. - The wives, children, parents of the 8,000 men affected by the hostage shootings. Gauleiter, do you want them? Ghetto? For now? Well, to be frank... And you? - As I said before.. May I speak with you, Mr. Secretary? Müller, Eichmann. Proceed in minutes. Let's not lose any time. For the remaining Serbian Jews we'll use gas trucks. Must we appease the Serbs? - No. Puppets. I'll handle the military commander myself. The Reichsführer will inform the SS. - Who should command? May I suggest Dr. Schäfer? He blew up the Gleiwitz radio station and will be discreet. When can he go to work? - In two days. Good, let's go. - The gas trucks are for us - Any objections? Of course not. - In the meantime, improvise. - Right. You had a question? - Yes. What's the situation with the Jews in friendly or independent countries? How will you induce them to hand over their Jews? We've tried to guide these countries onto an anti-Semitic path. We've induced some to pass Jewish laws based on the German model. We've made them accomplices. regarding their Jews residing in the Reich. Once the ice is broken, they’re more willing to listen. No one doubts your efficiency. - I mention it only to be complete. I am grateful for any information. The Reich Chancellery can only be effective as a link between the central authorities if it's adequately informed. - We don't keep secrets from you. The Foreign Office places agents, usually recruited from the SS in the foreign governments concerned to guarantee the necessary race policy initiatives. The Party Chancellery confirms that you have succeeded in creating room for rational socialists in diplomatic circles. Thank you. Are these people under the command of the Party? They are on loan from us. We at the Foreign Office enjoy support from the Reich Main Security Office which makes our work in foreign governments more effective with the help of special Jew consultants from the SS. The Foreign Office has handed authority over to the SS? It ends with the solution of the Jewish question. These people answer directly to you? - Yes. To my Jew specialist. Eichmann is more than a shipping agent, after all. He was even active in Serbia! Just a few suggestions on my part. Where else do Jew laws exist? - Slovakia, Croatia, Rumania. In Slovakia, they've been concentrated in three labor camps. What happens to the Jewish assets? Offered as bait to the governments. - That's billions. It's been decided at a higher level. We can expropriate it later. We try to have them contribute toward transport costs and sustenance in the East for every Jew deported. But, we hope, never from Italy. That would be a disaster. The Italians are more sensitive than even the Danes and Bulgarians. They jump to defend every single Jew. A disgusting mentality. It's high time our allies realized how things stand. What about the Cozzi affair? - Not that again! What was that? - The Italian Consul General in Danzig protested the transfer of an Italian Jewess, Jenni Cozzi to the Riga ghetto. - And? She was married to a high-ranking Italian officer, now deceased. - Ah so. I processed the case. The Italians demanded her release and return to Italy. You received my letter? - Yes. - I informed the Foreign Office that we cannot grant the request. We fear the Jewess Cozzi would exploit the conditions in the Riga ghetto to make propaganda for the Jews. That would complicate our position with Italy. We asked the Consul General to cease his protests. But for the Italians, it involves the honor of a deceased officer. The Italian Ambassador has requested we reconsider our decision. Now I know why the Italians can't win a war. Before you know it, Il Duce will be at our door. The Fascist Party has approached the Party Offices. We referred them to Gestapo IV-B4. - I gave the order: Cozzi stays. Done. - I refuse to trouble myself with 11 million Cozzis. She represents 58,000 Italian Jews. It could set a precedent. If there are no objections I'll address all Italian questions to Il Duce's Chief of Police. - We only request be kept informed. In the minutes? - In the minutes. You're still thinking? - I'm still thinking, Obergruppenführer. Any more questions about foreign Jews? - No, thank you. There aren't any dog lovers left in Germany. First we need a clear definition of how the groups are divided. Thank you. I have the flu. According to the Nuremberg Laws half-Jews are equated with Germans, so are exempt from Jewish measures. That’s going to change? - Yes, it will change. The basis of a new regulation is this letter which I received from the Reich Chancellery. Please read it out loud. You have a copy of it, don’t you? Do you have this? - Yes, I will open that. It concerns the treatment of those of first degree mixed race? In other words, so-called half-Jews. And I quote: “Jews of first-degree mixed race are the same as full Jews in regard to the final solution." - Half-Jews equal full Jews? That reversing everything the Ministry has advocated for six years. And for good reason! There are provisions for exceptions. Exeptions or not, we can't suddenly lower the status of half Jews and make them wear the Star of David. It’s out of the question! Just listen. - It says, “Exempt from this treatment are: A) "Half-Jews with a German spouse" - That goes without saying. "provided they have children i.e., quarter-Jews." Unacceptable. And B)? Half-Jews raised to Aryan status by the top authorities of the Party and the State by virtue of their special merit in vital fields." - How generous. However, a review of these case anticipated. Under whose guidance? - Yours, of course. And the Party’s. - Yes, of couse. The eventuality that a new decision will revoke the privileged status granted such Jews is not ruled put. - You don't say. Gentlemen, a blunt question. Who concocted this crap? Not you. - We did. The Party. The Brown House. We regard it as a draft. We will discuss about this. - Your opinions, gentlemen. It makes no difference if the mixed races stay or go. The Reichsminister would agree. Provided that it doesn't cost us any skilled armament workers. We’ll discuss that. - The Ministry or justice approves any action if it is within the law. I speak for all my comrades at SS Headquarters. The solution of the mixed-race question is crucial in the interest of racial purification. It’s time to clear out this half-breed race. It’s intolerable that it should be kept alive any longer. It constantly presents problems, and we don't have time for that. In the name of the Party and the Brown House I declare that the proposal to equate half-Jews with Jews with Jews is absolutely acceptable. You find it acceptable that we reexamine every mixed race case? Now, in the midst of war? That's a lot of work. We must all make an extra effort. Wouldn't it make more sense to do that at the front? It's certainly more pleasant work than being at the front. I shirk neither work nor active duty! I've repeatedly requested a command at the front which is more than others can say. - The fight against the Jews is of equal importance. - As it should be. I have nothing to be ashamed of. Five pounds of special Jewish legislation from my office prohibiting Jews from entering German forests, or keeping a canary. And always exempting the half-Jews. There are no directives to the contrary from the Führer. But it is self-evident in the final solution. Yes, for you, but not for me. What's the head count? - Half-Jews? In the Reich itself as of ’39: 72,000. - Holy God. And with dependents it's hundreds of thousands. - They weren't directly affected. Then why do we need a decision by the Führer? Isn't the right philosophy and attitude enough for a correct decision? It's not news that I'm called a Jew-lover in the Brown House. But repetition doesn't make it true. Otherwise I wouldn't be an honorary SS officer. Old animosities won't get us anywhere. Please continue, Staatssekretäre. - Thank you, Obergruppenführer. If I point out some of the questions of the mixed race problem I do so only in the interest of German people. The German people! Those bastards! It's not for my personal pleasure but because of legal stipulations. The letter of the law shouldn’t obstruct necessary developments. - That's how it is. Meanwhile I must accept "Heil Hitler" from a half-Jew neighbor. He’s not allowed to do that. - No? - No. Have you his name and address? - With pleasure. It leaves the door wide open for race defilement. He can't talk his way out of this. These people know the rules. We'll nail him. You were interrupted. Of course there’s no doubt that Jewish blood even that of half-Jews must be separated from the German bloodstream, but Not only out of the German bloodstream, but the European as wall. I understand that, but I can only speak of the mixed races in the Reich. What is decided here will apply abroad as well. Not just a handful of Jews but a six-figure number. - If not more. That would seriously affect transport planning. I don't know what the other countries will do, but I can't say to the Romanians and Bulgarians: “Children, adopt our Jewish laws but open for discussion." You just can’t do it like that. Our concept of a Jew must apply everywhere. In the East, records are insufficient to determine who's a Jew or who's a half-Jew. If we don't like someone’s nose, that's record enough. A rather coarse method, don't you think? - Let the chips fall. If need be, I can always call upon our experts. - At your service. The reorganization of this area will run along different lines. We will not bestow better treatment on mongrels and other subhumans, than on these eleven million. We need tough, determined action, not kid gloves. Sitting here comfortably behind the lines we don't have the right to act like heroes. Very correct. - Nor guardian angels. Continue your private war later. I must voice a protest on behalf of my office. The man makes the office. - I’m obliged to perform my duties correctly. It’s not that I’m a Jew-lover. Is that clear? - You’re not on trial. I would like to point out that half-Jews by blood are already classified by the Nuremberg Laws. If they have Jewish features, they are regarded as full Jews. Or if they are practicing Jews have a full-Jewish spouse. So many half-Jews have already been taken care of. We taken care. - Around 8,000. In the Reich? - Including Austria and the protectorate. Then they're available for the final solution. Eight trains full. - 8,000. And 72,000 half-Jews. So 72,000 minus 8,000 leaves 64,000. Among them, there are 45,000 men fit for service - three divisions. You can't intend to win the war with them. it wasn’t my idea to send them to the front. How many of them are in the army? - Maybe 10,000. That makes 54,000. - Many of them were drafted for armament work. How much? - About 20,000. - 34,000. Minus the 10,000 who would be sent to the old-age ghetto. - 24,000. Old-age ghetto? What about young women and children? 24,000 half-breeds left to be discussed. Threw them in with full Jews. - With Europe’s half-Jews. Europe, that's your business then. I only represent the Ministry of the Interior. But the 24,000 that’s your concern. Laws are easy to write. But the consequences must be considered, too. For God's sake, can't one get a glass of water? If people could only see this. In the Führers state, you give an order and it's done! Be nice if it were like that. We’re sitting here, quibbling while our men are being killed by those Jewish Bolsheviks. Incredible. Don’t forget there are highly honored half-Jews on our side... I haven’t forgotten them. I just don’t want them. The Iron Cross given to vermin! Disgusting! They’re also in the Officers' Corps. - Half-Jews? With the Führer's approval. And equal to Reich Germans. Fairy tales. Otherwise I'd have known. No point in publicizing these things. All right. But the other 24,000? Ask our man in charge of half-Jewish workers. Any special complaints? No. Their overall behavior is satisfactory. Of course. Otherwise, they'd lose their heads. It’s the German blood asserting itself in the half-Jew that makes him valuable. In theory, true. - And there's another thing - Every half-Jew has a full Aryan lineage. Relatives and friends in pure-blooded German circles. Thousands would be affected. It could cause further unrest like we had when the Führer started the euthanasia program. - Anything can be dramatized. Really? How do you suppose a soldier feels coming home and seeing Eichmann's trains at the station.. taking his half-Jewish relatives to the East. Where to? Why? And every half-Jew half the blood lost is German blood. Or half-Jewish, depending on how you look at it. To the pessimist, the glass is half empty. To the optimist, it’s half full. You are an optimist. I value German blood. I always warned the Germans against providing the enemy with good bloodlines. Blood able to produce great individuals on the other side would create — Other side? - Individuals who, through German blood, would inherit valuable characteristics... - What? ...which the enemies of German blood could use to their benefit. Jewish intelligence and education combined with Germanic genetic superiority could make the Jew a born leader. Plase calm! - And you can’t ignore European opinion! You don’t say! - You said the solution to these questions must be consistent. - Absolutely. - The foreign half-Jews uncounted carriers of German blood would be taken from our control even compelled to fight against us. Please, Gentelmen. I agree that blood is important. But to whom? It should be clear by now what we mean by the New Order of Europe and final solution. Exactly. - I clearly realize what is meant, Gruppenführer. The screw has been steadily tightening since the first Nuremberg Law when forced Jews to hand over their property and emigrate when we executed them in masses. We now have enough experience for the final solution. I hardly imagine we are going to send those 11 million to a holiday resort. I’d be blind not to see the writing on the wall. Who do you think I am? I repeat once again, you are not on trial. I hope you won’t think me a defeatist if I draw your attention to the following facts: We are still at war with Russia. England is no defeated; America is not yet on the scene. Whole areas of Europe seem to be slipping away. Resistance groups are spawning everywhere. All this is an attraction to those we act against - the half Jews. They won't escape. We'll keep them under our thumb. After victory, our first demand will be to round up every Jew and if we decide, every half-Jew from both hemispheres. Just as this war became a world war the final solution will also be worldwide. Do you have an alternative? What do you propose? I propose we do nothing. The laws allow half-Jews marry only Aryans. Within two generations half Jews will be absorbed into the population. We have orders to carry out a total purge. Well, there’s one more possibility. Sterilization. That’s been proposed in this draft. Under IV: “Those to be exempt from evacuation, i.e those married to pure-blooded Germans and those with exemption status are to be made infertile so they will produce no offspring." That isn't anything new. We've heard it before. - You don't understand. I’m talking about sterilizing all half-Jews, not just the favored ones. Compulsory collective sterilization. Why didn't you say so in the first place? I’m glad you’re not against the liquidation of the people of Judah and their watered-down offspring. - Sterilization. I like it. As a people, they'd be finished, but as a work force they'd be available for a while. That would mean thousands of sick days. Our hospitals are already filled with the wounded. And don’t forget the costs! I’ve heard it can be done with X-rays as well. - Experiments in concentration camps. One could order these Jewish gene-carriers to a special office. They step up to a desk with a hidden apparatus and while someone talks to them, it’s done. No fuss. We should discuss it' with the Reich Health Minister. We won’t solve the problem of the half-Jew today. Don’t forget the quarter Jews and mixed marriages. I want a transfer to the front. I can’t take any more of this. Why do we give preferential treatment to Jews married to Aryans? Comrade Streicher was right. A vagina defiled by Jewish sperm will always be a cesspool. And no German broom can sweep it clean. I suggest representatives of our various agencies continue the matter at a lower level. Obersturmbannführer Eichmann will contact your subordinate officers. And send the Chancellor's Office a report of all opinions. If no agreement is reached I will obtain a decision from the highest authority. Questions? I've already pointed out the problem: 2,5 million Polish ghetto Jews. Disease, crime. The Polish economy is threatened. Can't we attend to our Jews first? Few transport problems. Certainly. Polish Jews first. The Governor General will be pleased. We must try to avoid alarming the Polish population. It’s a matter of camouflage and speed. We'll do a good job. The minutes? - They will go out to you today. Your assignment... May I speak with you later? - Yes. Gentlemen, I’ll see you in Prinz-Albrecht Strasse. I’d like once again your guarantee of full support in implementing the final solution. That is all. Thank you. BERLIN. Final Solution Conference. Obergruppenführer? - Yes, please? - Excuse me. You said Jews not exempted by work are subject to special treatment. Yes, of course. - Now, during wartime, that would be eleven, twenty-two, maybe 33 million rounds of ammunition. There are other methods. More elegant ones. More humane ones. Read Mein Kampf, page 772. Learn to take the Führer at his word. Period. What did the Führer write? - It is referred to frequently. He says It would be best to simply use poison gas on the Hebrews. - Gas? I would like to be relieved of my duties. I can serve my country better with a rifle. I’ll submit my resignation through you to the Führer Will that work? Perhaps. - Thank you. We’re both dedicated National Socialists but some things are better left to the younger generation. - Pehaps. B, as in Bertha. - Heil Hitler! - Yes, Bertha. 3,000 unfit for work! You heard what I said, idiot! Over and out. I can’t get Riga, sir. - Nonsense, my dear. Those assholes are asleep. Thank you. - You smoke, herr Obergruppenführer? With cognak, as an exception, for today's celebration. Give me a draft of the minutes this afternoon. - Yes, herr Obergruppenführer. Be as clear as necessary and as vague as possible. May I ask what should be clear? Our authority. That's the main thing. Understood, Obergruppenführer. You’re in high spirits. Any special reason? As the confidential liaison in our Operations Center Now I see approval official approval at the very highest levels even in the civil administration. It gives me a feeling of real satisfaction. Comrade Eichmann has feelings. Müller. Wait a minute, Miss. It’s time you operators learn the proper titles. It’s not “Himmler’s Office. " “Office of the Reichsführer-SS." The Reichsführer himself for Heydrich? Heydrich. The conference just ended. Our authority was recognized without reservation by the departments that had been uncertain. Thank you very much Herr Reichsführer. Heil Hitler. Please, gentelmen. Our goal for today has been reached. The bureaucrats are now with us, like SS and the Party. There’s no more flirting with the West. No turning back now. With the Führer to the final victory or to death. Prosit, gentelmen! Gentelmen, Heil Hitler! - Heil Hitler! We’ll see each other in Prague? # It was worth coming to Berlin after all. What does he do out there? Stand guard, or just eat? Sniffs out hiding places. They sneak into chimneys hide in latrines under floorboards. Hasso finds them all. A hand grenade boom! THE WANNSEE KONFERENCE REINHARD HEYDRICH Deputy Reich Protector of Bohemia and Moravia.
