Jack, Jason here has just joined our ranks of professional magicians. quit the day job, huh? pretty much. congratulations. i hereby appoint you as the newest member to the third-most-mocked profession, right behind ventriloquists and mimes. thanks. hey, I’m gonna need a package of paper hat tears. sure. $14.95. I actually lost my wallet. it's a long story. dude, do you mind -- can you spot me? you want me to buy your hat tears? just this once. I’m waiting on my credit card. that was Don Tarzia. who? oh, come on. you got to know these people if you're gonna get anywhere. from the San Diego convention. I just got booked for next week. cool. maybe I’ll take Denise. who's Denise? oh, she's this girl I’m seeing. she is fantastic. she had her hands all over me at the magic palace. I took her in the séance room. I had her pick a card. and then I produced it... right out of her magic box. oh-ho-ho! you're gonna have to teach me that one! hey, you know what? you should go to San Diego. the contest is huge. you should enter that. ah... seriously, man. that contest has launched many careers. it launched mine. launched me right out of my ex-wife's house, right into my next wife's bosom. that contest is less than a week away. I don’t have an act. oh, come on. you got all sorts of good stuff. I can’t just do the cut-and-restored rope with the linking rings. I want my magic to be about people and relationships, not about props. hey, why don't we do an act together? oh, no, I don’t enter contests anymore. they're paying me to be there. check this out. this just came in. i really think you're gonna like it. now give me your hand. mm-hmm. now! oh, gosh! ugh! what's the problem? this kills at kids' parties! no, thanks. I am a veggie magician. funny. you just come up with that? yeah. yeah, don't put that in the act. hello? is this Jason Kant? yes! is this the Jason Kant who won first place in the magic camp contest 15 years ago? yeah, that -- that's me. who is this? oh, my God! you were so good. I competed against you. I did the act with flowers. Stacy Dietz. oh, yeah. I-I think I remember that. no, you don't. I did a mind-reading act. I would never do a flower act. okay, listen. I got to go. I’m --I’m new in town, and I don't know any magicians. I thought we could...get together and talk magic. okay, yeah. that actually would be good Because I’m working on a new act. how about dinner tonight? um, okay. there's a great italian place. it's in Encino. Café Carolina? yeah. I thought you just moved here. yes, but remember. I read minds. Eight o’clock I’ll be the one you want to have sex with. um...okay! well, see you tonight. who is it? I’m here to do a magic-o-gram for Paul's birthday. Paul's my dad. he's not here. do a trick. you're late! you were supposed to be here at two o’clock I’m sorry. it's, like, 2:04. he already left? I had to ruin the surprise to get him to stay. he knew Steve Kramer from TV, but he had never heard of you. so, he left. you any good? well, yeah. I mean, i actually got first place at magic camp. Steve only got fourth. there's a magic camp. loser! skip, put that down and watch the magician. and just them anywhere. shh! you like magic? here, you take the yellow paper, and I’ll take the black. here, take the paper. take the paper. now tear the paper up into tiny, little pieces. tear it up. Zach is sleeping. awesome! here. I’ll just do it. tear the paper up into tiny, little pieces, like I'd asked you to. I think we can do something really interesting here. it turns into... a hat! which you can keep. you suck. okay. well, this one I know you'll like. if you see a black card, say, "smoke," and if you see a red card, say, "fire." smoke. smoke. smoke. smoke. fire. fire! awesome! I’m gonna show Zach! I really don't appreciate you shooting cards at my son's face. it's just a joke. he seemed to enjoy it. don't cash this until tomorrow, or it'll bounce. do I have to tip you, too? well, it's customary. well, here. here's a roll of nickels. hey, Zach? fire! do you remember this girl from magic camp? we had girls at magic camp? yeah, downstairs. anyway, this girl, she called out of the blue. did she say I had sex with her? no! 'cause I don’t remember her. no, she called me. we're having dinner tonight. she called about you. that's great. is it a date? I’m not really sure. I don’t think so. I think we're just talking magic. hey, why don't you and Denise come join us? yeah, it didn't really work out. I did meet this new girl -- Cindy at the magic palace. she saw my close-up act. I bought her a drink and took her in the séance room. it wasn't just the spirits that made the table move. great. well, anyway, her name is Stacy Dietz. we're going to -- hold on. did you say Stacy Dietz? yeah. you know her? not personally, but I used to hear her name all the time. what did you hear? not much. she used to work a lot -- Atlantic city, Vegas. then, she just vanished. I figured she just went off to make babies. that's very crispy... Stacy? you. I brought back your wallet. the cash is gone. yeah, well, why do you think I took your wallet? and, besides, you were gonna buy me dinner, anyway, right? so, we can just think of this as our second date. our second date? and I will, too. are you a prostitute? no. are you an asshole? well, you picked my pocket. you keep offering me sex. I didn’t offer you sex. "I’ll be the one you want to have sex with." "think of this as our second date." what are you doing? I was just being friendly. oh. did you really go to magic camp, or was that a lie, too? okay. now you're just being rude. I’m gonna have to steal your wallet again. that's not my wallet. it's this guy's over here. e-excuse me? sorry, Sir? yeah. I think you dropped your wallet. oh, thanks. you're welcome. I’m sorry. we don't take checks. do you have a credit card? I did have credit cards. I had to cancel them. yeah, I know. it was very embarrassing. can you give us a minute? do you have any money on you at all? you want me to pay for our first date? second date. remember? that's right. do you work at all, like, a real job, or do you just swindle people to get by? if someone is stupid enough to play the 3-shell game, they deserve to lose their money. this is not gonna be enough. very nice. ah! wait a minute! we need a tip. I mean, she was a pretty good waitress, right? nice. this is one of those trick quarters. I don’t think so. sure it is, 'cause it can pass right through the table. very nice. here, this time I’ll cover it. give me your hand. here. press. now let's see if it worked. oh! it's got to be heads. here. press. now! you pushed too hard! went right through the table. see? okay. watch my ring. very jumpy. ready? gonna jump, jump back. jump, jump back. hmm. let's see. just put a little salt on there. and whoa. nicely done. where is it? hmm. mm-hmm. yeah. yeah. check the salt shaker. can you please not do that to the salt? that good? have you done escapes before? oh, sure. handcuffs, straitjackets, even one really bad relationship. really? just an evil magician. hmm. I’ve heard of those. okay. now escape. I-I don’t actually know how to do a rope escape. is there a trick to it? there's always a trick. I’ll teach you. maybe we could do the act together. you could be my assistant. your assistant? you know what I mean. no, I don’t. I’m a magician, not some bimbo who's gonna get into a skimpy outfit and carry your props around like some kind of sex slave. I-I didn’t mean that. yeah, I always wanted to be the assistant. people get confused when they see me alone on stage. assistant. what a stupid, sexist label. half the time, the assistants are doing way more work than the magicians, and yet, they don't even get a bow! they only get their first name up on the marquee if they even get a name at all! I wouldn't do that. oh, yeah? I once did a show with a guy where I cut him in half. so, it's like a role reversal, right? but because he's the guy, and I’m the chick, he gets billed as the magician, and I’m the assistant. I mean, aren't we both magicians? we're both doing the same magic trick. it's just so stupid. I agree with you. oh, yeah. your dick agrees with me. she's totally right. the assistant is always smiling when the magician cuts her in half. smiling! she should be screaming for her life. you're overthinking this, man. assistants are never trained actors or magicians. they're just girlfriends or wives. unless they're a gay magician. then, it's the sister. it's a dead giveaway for a gay magician when the assistant is the sister. you just gave me a great idea. I got it. I got the act! that's great. I’m gonna enter the contest. terrific. with Stacy. really? she's a little volatile. why don't you just ask any of the other female magicians? all five of them. no, no. it has to be her. there's nobody that'll do it better. hey, buddy? you want to make some money? where is she? where's Stacy? the cheater. beat it. this is my turf. I’m not looking for any trouble. I’m just looking for Stacy. well, if you're looking for Stacy, then you are looking for trouble. she's an old friend of mine. I just want to talk to her. I-- do you have her number? look. even if I did, Stacy's not the kind of woman you reach by phone. look. I’ll give you 20 bucks if you help me find her. $20 for her, $20 for me. fine, fine. there's a magic show up on the cannon. she used to work there -- not anymore. but above there are some rooms. rooms? yeah, kind of a halfway house for magicians. Blaine once stayed there. David Blaine? after he froze himself up on that block of ice, he was pretty messed up. good luck. excuse me? the show's at 8:00. come back tonight. I’m looking for Stacy Dietz! are you a magician? yeah. you do children's parties? yes, I do -- change bag, coloring book, yeah. you're too nice. you can't handle her. I-I think I can. I’m gonna try to help her get out of this place. up those steps. you'll need this, Lancelot. we're full. is Stacy here? what are you, a debt collector? no, I’m a magician. well, you don't look like one, banana boy. 7 of spades. find it. ha! yeah. magician. huh! not bad... for a juggler. that's not the 7 of spades. now tell me where she is. keep the deck. their markings will lead you to her. all right? can't find the markings, huh? I’ve seen just about every mark that there is. as a matter of fact, I’ve invented a few of them. oh. y-you see them? sure. it's been right in front of you all the time. really? it's not the back or the front. this gets a little strange on the side... sort of like my ex-wife but if you use the gold trifecta cut with the high flip and internal shuffle... does "3 & Fairfax" mean anything to you? third and Fairfax? isn't that the farmers market? it sure is. thanks, jack. oh, sure, guys. do you know what this is? the 4 of hearts? well, yeah! of course you would know that 'cause I showed you the card. well, you would probably know that even if I didn’t show you the card. but what kind of a 4 of hearts? I-I’m sorry. do I know you? it's the 4 of hearts with my DNA. see? the lipstick. we have to go. wait. hold on. you saw my show? don't you remember? I’m Ellen. last week, the magic palace? yeah, right. séance room, right? no! you brought me up as your volunteer, and I picked this card, and you found it. and now I found you. you sure have. all right, get her number. we have to go. I kept this card under my pillow this whole time. wow. that must be a very happy card. I came here every day looking for you. But I’m not a stalker. don't think I’m weird. meet me at the farmers market. I’m going. wait! can you just take a quick picture of the two of us for Facebook? sure. oh, wow! oh! going to the park with Steve Kramer. post! when you said you were performing at the B.M. convention, I thought you meant bowel movement. but now I get it. you meant B.M. -- brotherhood of magicians. I mean, the biggest magic convention in the world. I can’t believe they call it a brotherhood, by the way. that is so sexist. they should totally change that name. now the needle goes through my stomach. I mean, what about the female magicians? like, are they part of some brotherhood? that is so sexist. they should go on strike. I’ll be right back. oh, okay. good luck! oh, that is so gross. 9-1-1, anyone? gross. hallelujah. there is a God. all right. that's the show, everybody. thanks so much. I did my part. now it's your turn. if you enjoyed the show, place something in the hat. thank you. I didn’t like the last one. oh, you loved it. I saw you. cool show. thank you. thanks. great show. it couldn't have been that great if it's only worth a buck. I came to apologize. no need. so, we're good? we're nothing. I wrote an act based on what you said about magic assistants. I never thought about it that way. it really opened my eyes. are you doing the contest? yes. but I want to do it with you -- partners. what's the act? well, you're not my assistant, but you play my assistant. it's like an acting role, but you have the upper hand. uh-huh. and what part do you play? the magician. j-just read it and tell me what you think. sure. thanks. it's perfect. Ladies and gentlemen, one moment, please. this man -- this man here wants to be a magician. isn't that cute? so, we're gonna let him do one trick. so, Sir, take this and tear it up into as many pieces as you can. come on. rip it! come on! do it! do it! do it. oh! there you go. yeah! now all you have to do is say the magic words. abracadabra. oh, look! he really is a magician! he's got a wizard's hat. yes! she is good. got to give her that. aw, don't be sad. I’ll be your assistant? really? we have to put it together in, like, three days. have you ever been on stage? of course. I’ve been an actress my whole life. i won best actress. all right. let's give it a try. don't I look gorgeous? huh? say, "linking rings." linking rings. I’m gonna post your picture on Facebook. off to San Diego to win a magic competition with my magic partner. and my boyfriend. post. it's gonna be very competitive. I just want to make the finals, because then you get to do the act in a huge theater for, like, a thousand people. well, it's a great act. we're totally gonna win. and then, we're gonna get booked to the magic palace, and then we're gonna be Steve's opening act. and we're gonna travel the country and the world. you mind if I just put on some music? that's a really good idea. no, that's totally fine. * and it threw off my whole day * * just the let the mystery be about the birds and trees * I’m here to rehearse. what's wrong? nothing. let's just do it. why do you have your bags? Steve broke up with me. oh, great. it's not great. no, I know.I’m really sorry. just start. good evening, Ladies and gentlemen. my name is Jason Kant, and this is my lovely assistant, Ellen. I can’t do this. I’m not gonna be able to do this. what do you mean? I think you should get someone else. I’m too scared. but the contest is tomorrow. I’m sorry. this is too hard. you're doing great. you're very funny. but I keep thinking of Steve, and it's messing me up. and what if the audience sees what I do, and I give away the trick? they won't. you won't. how do you know that? we've been rehearsing it nonstop, and I’m still messing up the magic. if you mess up the trick, I’ll cover for you. I have outs. it's like we only get one shot, and we have to get the lines right, and we have to respond to what the volunteer says, and they have to make this magic trick happen. and it's just too much responsibility. you'll be fine. this is what all your acting training prepared you for. I lied. I lied! I’ve never acted before in my life. I’m so scared! I’m in over my head. please don't make me do this. you're gonna be fine. you'll get up there, and the audience will be laughing. you'll see. and you'll relax. you think I’m funny? absolutely. okay. okay, I’ll do the act. you'll be terrific. we'll be terrific. you're awesome. uh... maybe...maybe we should keep this professional. you... you don't find me attractive? of course I find you attractive. oh. oh. I think I like your lips better than Steve's. I’m sort of --I’m sort of seeing someone. lying! Steve told me you haven't had a girlfriend in months. I just... I just think... I just think it might complicate things. are you rejecting me? 'cause I cannot take a second rejection in one day. you better not be rejecting me. no,I’m not... I’m not rejecting you. you're such a good guy. I can’t believe I didn’t see it before. the contest meeting will begin shortly. shuttles between the magish inn and the San Diego hotel and dealers room leave every 15 minutes. did you see that? did you see that? no. watch the wand. did you see that? welcome, everyone. poof! Sim Sala Bim. hopeful contestants have appeared before my eyes. you have come from far and wide to show your skills, your sleights, your showmanship. I know I’m late, but I have a good excuse. I wanted to make a big entrance to mess with everyone's mind. and some to show their lack of professionalism. the contest tomorrow will be right here, at the Magish Inn. eight minutes will be the limit. do not exceed. now, any questions? yeah, I’m the raven, and I need a sound check before the contest because I play my music really loud. today will transform into tomorrow. best be on your way. runaway, little rabbits. wait a minute. what about my sound check? I want to say hello to an old friend. oh, I want to meet him. hi. so, you're competing? perceptive. this must be your assistant. no, she's my partner. I’m an actress. do you know they have a spouses' event? I hear it used to be called the Ladies' event. it's probably some tupperware party. I mean, what if you brought your spouse? do you have a boyfriend? no. oh. well, if you have a thing for magicians, then you've come to the right place. I already nabbed this one. oh. congratulations. thanks. but if you did have a boyfriend, he wouldn't want to go to some tupperware party, anyway, would he? we're not done yet. yikes! I’m running out of arms. hey! are you -- are you ready? when are you up? in, like, five minutes, and she's not here. where is she? I don’t know. she was on her cellphone doing Facebook stuff. she said she'd be right over, but now she's not answering her phone. I’m gonna run back to the hotel. no, you'll never make it. oh, crap! what a disaster. you picked a great time to break up with her. good morning. ready to make a little magic? mmm. where have you been? well, I got a little bit nervous, so I did a poll on Facebook to see if I should do the act. "go for it" won by a landslide. we're up next. we're on in, like, four minutes. great. do I have time to pee? no! are you always this high-strung? yeah. I’m not talking to you. your words are invisible to me. I got to pee. I’ll be right back. what was that? what? that kiss. she was upset because of you, and we sort of hooked up. now we're sort of dating. what?! it just happened, and I can’t really get out of it. she is so annoying. look. I know. but I can’t have her get all crazy on me, you know? I need to keep her balanced. oh, so you're using her. wow! what? I don’t think you've ever treated a girl this badly in your life. oh, come on. what would you have done? if i rejected her like you did, she never would have stayed to do the contest. the pupil has become the master. the pupil. I was never your pupil. sure. next up, we have Jason Kant and Ellen Taylor. good morning, Ladies and Gentlemen. my name is Jason Kant, and this is my lovely assistant, Ellen. you forgot the tray. um, today, I will be performing the world premiere of a brand-new illusion, the floating watch. Sir, what's your name? George. hey, George, do you mind if i borrow your watch? yeah, sure. don't worry. no harm will come to it. thanks. can't believe you just gave it to me. that was too easy. hey, George, can I borrow your credit cards, too? where's the bag? I don’t have a bag. can you...get the bag? which bag? the magic bag. oh, the magic bag. yes. can you get it? yes, I’ll get your magic bag! here's how the illusion will work George's watch will float 10 feet up in the air, around the entire audience, over your heads, and back into my waiting hands. here's the magic bag, your lordship. thank you. yeah. now, to prove that the watch is not connected to any wires or threads, I will place it inside of this paper bag. what are you doing? I’m filing my nails. do you have to do that now? can you think of a better time? no, I guess not. can you hold the bag? oh, my God! here's what I need everyone to do. I need everyone to focus your energies onto George's watch. think very light, airy thoughts, like a feather. think very -- think very light, airy thoughts, like a feather, floating calmly, softly in the wind. calmly, in the wind. Ellen, why don't you just go sit down? okay, babe? calmly, in the wind, like a feather. we'll need absolute silence. stop it! what are you doing?! I don’t care! you don't care about our relationship at all! all you care about is your stupid magic tricks! uh... George? um... I don’t -- I don’t think I’m gonna be able to float your watch. um...here, let's see. I’ll do another trick. no. uh... here, card trick. they're all different. I’ll bring cards a little bit to the bottom of the deck a little bit at a time. anytime you want, you just say, "stop." stop. okay, right there. this is George's card. everyone remember George's card. okay? George's card. hey, you know what? I think I have an idea how we might be able -- whoa! I think I have an idea how we might be able to fix George's watch. I’m not sure if I remember exactly how to do this, but I think that if I put the watch pieces into the bag, we may be able to find George's card and restore his watch. I want to talk. right now? yes. can't it wait? no, it can't wait. what's more important to you, me or this act? you. okay, so, I want some changes, or I’m leaving. okay. what changes? first of all,I’m tired of going, "ooh" and "ahh" while you do your tricks. I feel like I’m in a porno movie. okay. and I don’t want to be your slave. I walk around carrying your props all day long. from now on, I want us to do the tricks together or not at all. together? yes. a partnership. well, okay, we could try that. really? sure. I love you. I love you, too. okay, George, Jason and I are gonna try to finish this trick together. ready? ready. and with that magical kiss, let's see what happened. oh, God. okay, there's definitely a card in here. it's the 2 of diamonds. is that your card, George? yeah. great! but, unfortunately, there's no watch. well, we found your card, and that was a pretty good trick. yeah! and Ellen and I have made up, and that's what's really important. oh, my gosh! Ellen, what -- what is this on your leg?! it's a watch! it's George's watch! George? George, you want to come get your watch? hey, watch it, buddy. there you go. thank you very much. thank you! thanks. we were funny, right? you were great. i swear. when you stomped on the watch, some of them thought it was real. I know! they thought it was real! hey! I messed up one joke. no, it's okay. nobody noticed. you were really funny. I wanted it to be perfect. how was the watch trick? it looked good. it looked really good. you think so? you didn't see the move? no, you actually fooled me. it was great. it was really great. I wish I had known. it's really wonderful. you too! nice job. oh. surprisingly. thanks. I got to get ready. I’m on in an hour. will you come watch? sure. I can’t tell if she likes me or hates me. at least she acknowledged you. she's stressed. she has to get ready. well, I’m gonna go to the zoo. really? yeah, the spouses' event is way cooler than I thought. I’m gonna go see some giraffes. oh, but first I have to see the raven. is that part of the bird show? he's in the contest. he floats a drum set while playing the drums. oh, my God, he's up. I’m gonna go watch. ...the raven! I’m back. when do you leave for the zoo? yeah, I’m not really into zoos. how did you -- is she gone? didn't you catch it? thought I was being totally obvious. swiped it from Ellen. I hope you don't mind. the hotel was full, so I’m staying out in the boonies. that's fine. did the zoo trip already leave? don't worry about her. if she comes back, we'll just tell her that you were helping me with my act. okay. here. could you put this stuff in my hair? just, yeah. just put it in there. mess it all up. make it crazy. it's for the act. great. okay. got to go. see you over there. this screen here is for our next performer, a female magician. Stacy Dietz. I always wanted to be a magician, ever since I was a little girl. I used to saw my barbies in half. I did trade shows, county fairs, and ended up in Vegas. that's where all the great magicians go. David Copperfield, Cris Angel, Penn & Teller. I picked a corner, passed the hat, and worked for tips. then, I met Nathan. he had his picture on the side of the building. he was very proud of that. he showered me with gifts and helped me get high-paying magic jobs. he even let me be a guest performer in his show -- 8 minutes on stage, all to myself. and then he produced my own show -- seven shows a week, packed houses. Nathan was right there, supporting me on opening night. I was finally making some money as a magician -- real money and lots of it. but Nathan and I... ...we didn't always see eye to eye. and sometimes I don’t always say the right thing. so, he ended the show... and he ended us. that was amazing. it was really powerful. thanks. it really made a statement. it was about something. nobody does that. except you. nice job yesterday. thanks. sound system was a load of bollocks. ahem! it is my pleasure to announce the six finalists. ah-- they will perform at the historic Balboa Theatre in the gaslamp district tomorrow night, Friday night, in front of a sold-out audience. they will also receive a free one-year subscription to top hat magazine, electronic version only. in no particular order, the six finalists are Stacy Dietz. yes! hmm. The Palindromes. Larry Mable and Jen. Kristoff Brayton. Conjuring Conrad. yeah! and Eddie Fox. everyone else, come try again next year in Baltimore. congratulations. I’m really happy for you. it should have been both of us. let's go. aah! I’m gonna take a walk. I’ll come with you. I just need a little time alone. you know, I didn’t get into the finals, either. I worked hard for this, too. I know. I just need some time to think. you can't think with me around?! I’m too loud?! you're meeting her. no, I wasn't. oh, come on! I’m not stupid. go. go over to her. I could use a drink, too. she probably slept with half the judges. please. just go back up to the room. you're really being annoying. aah! I’m too old to start a brand-new career. starving artist -- am I kidding myself? I clearly don't have the drive that you have, that Steve has. I’m going back to software. I have a surprise for you. really? mm-hmm. card trick. index cards, each with a name of one of the contestants. you want me to pick one? spring them in the air. do it. I speared you. the other one's mine. what are these? scorecards from the contest. how did you get these? don't you want to see how you did? we're not supposed to see these. I wanted to do something nice for you. don't drag me into this. if we get caught, I’ll never be able to enter the contest again. please, you don't need them. come on. you know you want to see how you did. okay. "originality, 9. presentation, 9. skill level, 6." whatever. "execution, 8. audience response, 10." wow! total, 42. what? 42. that doesn't make any sense. I got a 40. what the hell? you were supposed to be in the finals, not me. let me see these. I was one of the top scores. I was as good as any of them. why would they do this? we have to talk to don. wait. this isn't right. we weren't supposed to see these. you can't say anything. I’m not gonna keep quiet about this. you're in the finals. you deserve to be in the finals. don't screw this up. fine. I’ll put them back. nobody will know. it'll be our little secret. saw you talking to Stacy. we were just doing some card tricks. hmm. well, I want to talk to you about something. it's kind of hush-hush. okay. that act -- one of the judges, Foo Ling Yu he thought you should be in the finals, but for me, it needed more magic. o-okay, I’ll keep that in mind. um...how much would we have to pay you to get you to perform for the closing-night gala Saturday night? really? wow! anything -- nothing! because it was very creative, and we think it would go really well with the closing-night show. tech rehearsal is noon saturday. thanks. we'll be there. can I have the light on her face? it's too bright. take it down to 5. so, Don, why was I picked as a finalist? back up to 7. what do you mean? I mean, how does the judging work? we have a system. it's confidential. so, what, the scores are bogus? you just pick who you want? we have six acts to tech. can we talk about this later? I was thinking of adding a little card manipulation. what do you think? oh, 40. Jason Kant, 42. Mr. Lucky, 41. Slide Jester, 41. all higher scores than on the finals. how did you get those? you used a pin-and-tumbler lock, Don. the young magicians' club can pick locks more sophisticated than that. it's none of your business how we decide. what's to decide? just add up the scores and tell us who won. it's a lot more complicated than that! how? tell me how. look. the reason you're in the show is because you're a woman. why? why would you do that? don't be naive! we have a full house tonight. we want variety. of course we take the top acts. we take the top illusionist, the top manipulator, the top dove act. you're the top female act, something a little different. last year, it was jugglers. this year, it's you. oh, so, I’m a category? I’m a freak show? "oh, look. a woman can do magic -- how unusual. next up, two-headed babies"? it's an opportunity. doesn't matter why you're in. you're in. so, stop with the hysterics and be a professional. professional? I’ve been a professional since I was 10 years old. you're nothing but a hack! is that what you think? well, this is my show, and you are out of it. you blew it. now get the hell out of here! Mr. Eddie Fox, you're next. Ellen, it's Jason. you've been gone all night. look. please call me back. I know you're mad at me, but I’ve got really exciting news. you never tell a woman she's annoying. she was. and now she's gone. good job. here's her last Facebook post. "off on a secret adventure." she posted that 30 minutes ago. you never should have gotten involved with her in the first place. you never stick your wand in your magical bunny. what?! business/pleasure. she just posted a link. it's a map. click it. where does it go? Tijuana. no! no. don't even think about it. we're going to Mexico. you don't even know where she's gonna be. and I’m already missing the balloon-animal lecture. she posted a photo -- El Cortez Motel. she's staying over? yeah. and they've got a jacuzzi. there she is. Ellen, please open the door. Ellen? oh, hey. this isn't the best time. I called you 20 times. I know. I deleted them. I had enough of listening to your lies. you have to come back. we got booked. they want us to perform on Saturday night's show. really? yeah. but I thought the finals were tonight. they are, but this is even better. they want us to perform on the Saturday-night gala. wow. I was really good. but I can’t do it. why not? it's my birthday. we're traveling all over Mexico together. me...and Herman. Herman? this is a huge opportunity. we're gonna be performing side by side with some of the biggest names in magic. there's gonna be all kinds of important people there -- Penn & Teller, David Copperfield, Cris Angel. I don’t know who those people are. they're hacks! there will be people who can book us places -- The Magic Palace, Vegas casinos, TV specials. look. I can put my condom on without using my hands. I don’t really want to be with people who find me annoying. you're not annoying. I shouldn't have said that. I was an ass. but this is an acting job. this is a showcase for you. I told you. I’m not really an actor. then, why did you do it in the first place? to be near Steve. but now I hate him. and I hate you! look. there must be 200 magic assistants running around that place. throw a rabbit, and you'll hit one. this isn't a normal magic act. I need someone who's really funny. you're fantastic in this role. I’m sorry. good luck. oh. expired. so, will you do it? you want me to put on a dress and act like your girlfriend? we could be a gay couple. no. no, we can't. look. I'd like to help with your act, but I don’t have time. I have the close-up show tomorrow afternoon. I have to rehearse. and, by the way, I'd like you to do the introduction. oh. sure. why don't you have Stacy help you with act? I don’t trust her. she stole my wallet, my room key, the scorecards. she seems to be practically homeless. you saw her act. breaking up with Nathan must have really messed her up. okay. well, I’ve been dumped before, and I didn’t become a thief. I’ve never been dumped, but these things happen. she's an artist. she lives on the edge. I can relate. so, you're saying I’m not an artist. no, no. I’m not saying that. you're responsible. you pay taxes. you don't pay taxes? I pay taxes...usually. I really like her. I just don't know if we're compatible. she'll pull me into her sordid life. we'll be the next Bonnie and Clyde. she may be Bonnie, but you're no Clyde. it's just, I’m not really sure how she gets by. I’m not sure that it's legal. I kind of suspect it's not. I wouldn't put it past her to hot-wire my car. why would I hot-wire it? I already have the key. what are you doing back there? my car got towed. yes, but what are you doing in my car? got to sleep somewhere, don't I? you were sleeping in his car? no, I was sleeping in my car, and then those bastards towed it, and then, I slept in his car. I thought you were staying in a hotel out in the boonies. you embarrass me now, after you've been talking crap about me? wait. when are the finals? aren't you supposed to be there? I got kicked out of the show. what? you told him about the scorecards, didn't you? I told you not to do that. hey, if you want me to do this act with you, you better change your tone of voice. you'll do the act? and since your yapping girlfriend is out of the picture, I’ll crash in your room while we fix your act. does it need fixing? it needs more magic. she's right about that. we'll fix your act, and then those bastards will finally give us the respect we deserve. pull over. I got to piss. I got it. you don't like your assistant costume, and so you magically change it. ooh, I like it. do you know how to do that? no idea, but we'll figure something out. I just need to figure out exactly what you're gonna say. why the change? what do you mean? I mean, is it that you liked my act, and that's what changed your mind about me? I told you I loved your act. I know, but why are you here now? I mean, is it the act, or do you just need a place to stay? why are you sabotaging this? are you that insecure? no. I mean... I mean, you're beautiful. I just want to throw you on that bed and attack you. well? you're not the easiest person to trust. did you swallow Ellen? is that why you won't shut up? I mean, what's with all the stealing? are you some sort of klepto? I used to ask for things. and I heard "no" too often. so, now I just take. and that's what happened in Vegas. you stole from him? no, I did not steal from him. after we broke up, he went around and told everyone not to hire me. I went to every show in town. they all said no. but you didn't give up. people say no to me, I just give up. you haven't given up. I want to thank you. your act, the show tomorrow -- it's given me a second chance. let's work on the costume change. tomorrow. first thing... I got the most amazing idea for the act, and now she's gone. there's only three hours till the tech rehearsal, and she's gone. relax. she's probably just looking for a costume. by the way, the costume change is a great idea. how'd you know about the costume change? didn't you just tell me? no. yeah. I guess she told me. have you seen this? this is good. this would be good for your act. when did she tell you? I don’t know. in the car, sometime yesterday? that's interesting, because i came up with the idea last night before we went to sleep. I saw her last night. when? look. when I left you guys yesterday, she shook my hand. oh. well, then, she must want you. and she gave me a note. oh, my God. no more partner acts. I am sick of depending on other people. I’m gonna make a whole, new act alone. I don’t need her. and I don’t need you. ow. ow! where's your assistant? no idea. how are you gonna do your act without an assistant? I have a brand-new act. no! we hired you to do that act, not some crappy thing you threw together in the dealers' room. it's not crap. I know what I’m doing. okay, good. great. go do it -- just not on my stage. you're saying no to me? that's right. I won't accept it. I’ve earned this spot. can we bring in the next act? hey, Don. hey, your Highness. good to see you. good to see -- ho-ho! whoa-ho! let's make some magic. Merry Christmas. what? she's still not back? no. she's probably sleeping on some bench somewhere because she was out all night with you. and now, the stars of magic close-up show, starring Steve Kramer and Brian Gillis. and right down through there. hold it level. look at me, and whenever you want it to explode, blink your eyes. one more time, Aneiszka. this next performer, you're gonna really enjoy. he's a fantastic magician, and he's my closest friend. we met many years back as teenagers in magic camp. we competed against each other. I won that one. since then, his career has gone leaps and bounds. he was the host of TV's "magicians on ice." you didn't see it? yeah, nobody saw it. it was terrible, absolutely terrible! he is a frequent performer at The Magic Palace. very popular with the Ladies. don't go up to the séance room with him. the floor's a little sticky. but don't worry, Steve. I’ve heard that you got your premature-ejaculation problem under control. it's perfectly normal. happens to the best of us. and you are certainly one of the best. so, let's welcome Steve Kramer, the amazing ejaculator. hmm. thank you, Jason, for that humiliating introduction. don't worry. I won't be asking you to do that again. hi. what's your name? Peggy . I’m Steve. nice to meet you. would you mind helping me out? sure. give her a nice hand. you watch TV? yeah. how about those CSI shows? yeah. you notice that they always solve the crimes using DNA, right? mm-hmm. so, I thought, wouldn't it be fun to do magic using dna? so, help me out with that? sure. Peggy, just take a card, any card. mix them up like that. remember it. show it to everybody, not to me. and then turn back around. Peggy, we need to mark that card in some way, using your DNA. we can use any DNA you'd like. I recommend a kiss. so, I’m gonna turn around. I’ll make myself look like a real detective, and plant a good one on the face of that card, would you? kiss that thing, would you? okay. she kissed the card. it's a lot more than I did with Stacy. sorry. put it back in. now, I have to figure out what Peggy's card is, and I think I can do that if you... kiss me. oh, you're with her, huh? because you look pissed. calm down. all right? seriously, go ahead and kiss me. it's okay. what? no, really. go ahead and kiss me. okay. really? you went in for it? you're going in for it? seriously, you went in for it? really? nobody ever goes in for it. is that what you think I did? went after your girl? hey, don't leave, Jason. trick's not over yet. this is a crime scene, and i don't want to contaminate the scene. so, I’ve got an idea, Peggy . kiss me through the glass. good idea, right? yeah. you're okay with this, right? yeah. you're not gonna get jealous, like Jason, right? good. let's do this. oh, we probably should clean the crime scene. do me a favor. pick a wetnap, any wetnap. is that the one you want, or do you want to change your mind? no, this is good. by the way, on those CSI shows and in real life, this is how they clean crime scenes. they use wetnaps. it's true. so, kiss me through the glass. you jealous, Jason ? wish you were up here, kissing Peggy ? you just can't be happy for me, huh? you think I don’t work hard. you know how hard I worked to create an act that would get me hired and laid at the same time? Peggy, through the glass. okay, okay. awesome. wow! there it is. look. look up there. it's a black card. it's a spade. it's the 2 of spades. am i right? yeah. right. magic with DNA. thanks. whoa! here. as a parting gift, your very own wetnap. take anyone you want. excuse me. he's leaving. guess he can't handle other people's success. wetnap -- when you don't have time for the whole dream. you'll get it. all right. I wish he hadn't left, because he missed the fact that Peggy picked the only wetnap that has a card inside. take it. open it up. does that have your DNA? yes. show them. that's Peggy, everybody. what the hell was that? you're mad at me, fine, but don't take it out on me here, in front of my peers. "the amazing ejaculator"? seriously? I’ve never performed so angry in my life. and that audience has no idea what the hell's going on. they still enjoyed it. it was a good show. whatever. hey, good show -- really fun. you were terrific. that was a really funny bit you guys had going on there, like Abbott and Costello or something. that was a bit, right? yeah. thank you. see? you turn every situation into gold. for me, it's always a disaster. I can’t seem to get a break. she'll turn up. Don kicked me out of the show. he was only interested in the assistant act, and Stacy missed the tech rehearsal. wow. yeah. you know, it's not my fault. I’m not her keeper. we were trying to help you. we were brainstorming methods for you costume change. you want to help me? you come talk to me, and we can brainstorm. I know what I want for this act. I wrote it. look. I’ve been very supportive with you in this act. I was very proud of you that you were competing. I don’t want you to be proud of me. don't you see how that puts me lower than you? you're not proud of a peer. you're proud of a child or a student. I’m not your student. okay. let's talk to Don. it's too late. no way. tech rehearsal always runs late. and if Stacy won't help you with the act, I will. y-you'll be the assistant? like Abbott and Costello... if they were gay. come on. around to the stage doors. I know that. you find your assistant? I’m uh, gonna fill in. oh, come on. don't waste my time. why can't I have a male assistant? you can have any assistant you want. I don’t care. but we liked your act the way we saw it, with a girl, and she's upset, and you make up, and you kiss. the two of you do that? it's a family show. what, you don't think i can play a sexy assistant? no! how about now? look. I can’t have an unknown talent doing an unknown act. Steve, why don't you take his slot? I could use some comedy. no, you're making a mistake. he's got chops. he's as good as me. and his new act? it'll blow you away. you've seen it? well, no, but I know it's got a lot of rope. we've all felt trapped at one time or another. trapped by a job we thought we couldn't escape, a bad relationship, a reputation that we could no longer live up to... or one that we could not shake off. who is in seat I-17? right here. Sir, while Don tied me up, you wrote down a way that you felt trapped. there's no way that I could know what's written on your paper. is that correct? yeah. I want you to think about what you wrote. concentrate. I’m getting an image. I am getting an image of briefs. you feel trapped by tight-fitting underwear. is that correct? yeah, that's right. and your wife gave you that underwear on your birthday. I didn’t even write that. and the pattern on the briefs is little red hearts. is that right? look. there's no way you could have known that. who is in seat k-15? that's me. Sir, think about what you wrote. I’m getting an image. I’m getting an image of you relaxing and having dinner before the show, 'cause you feel trapped in this theater because this tech rehearsal will never end. is that right? word for word. well, this tech rehearsal is over! 'cause I will see you tonight! now wait a minute. what about me? you put in an envelope? no. but I wrote it down right here. now, if you can tell me why I feel trapped here, now, that would be a damn good trick. yes, it would. it certainly would. this isn't how the trick is supposed to go. I know. it's a pretty good act, but you said I'd be blown away, and that hasn't happened yet. give the guy a break. he knew what pattern my underwear was. he could have seen you in the bathroom. it's no big deal. ooh, look at me! another big entrance. nice legs. where have you been? saving your act. she's not going on my stage -- no way. don't worry, Don. I’m doing the new act. it's a solo act. what?! out of my way, Merlin. thought you wanted a partner. partner? you want to be my partner, but yet you sneak out in the middle of the night? you were sleeping. you got me all excited. my head was spinning. but you had already made a plan to meet. you knew you were going out, and you didn't tell me. there are things that I can’t say to you. I’m not a good person like you are, and I could tell that Steve was a scumbag, too. what? what? look. I’m done here. just wait a minute. if you can't say those things, how can we be together? when I was with Nathan, everybody always thought of me as Nathan Burton's girlfriend. even when I had my own show, nobody took me seriously. but then, I talked to Steve, and he said no one takes you seriously, either. so, that made me feel better. I thought maybe we could struggle together. it's Don's. I’ve decided to do the assistant act with Stacy. no way -- that's not gonna happen. I’ll tell you what's on your paper, and you let us do the act. all right, you have a deal. before I started the act, I placed a piece of paper into my wallet, a prediction, if you will. and written on that paper... says, "I feel trapped by a 100-year-old magic organization resistant to change." wow. all right, but what I wrote, that does not leave this room. do you understand? sure. you want your wallet back? I’m tired of going "ooh" and "ahh" every time you do a trick. I feel like I’m in some kind of porno movie. okay. and look at the way I’m dressed I mean, do you see a pool around here? I’m cold! how would you feel if you had to wear an outfit like this? from now on, we do the act together or not at all. Stacy, what's this on your leg?! it's Paul's watch. Paul, do you want to come up here and get your watch? hey, watch it, buddy. both: thank you very much. the costumes were a huge hit. they were also stolen. the cops! just walk very slowly. then, when we're getting off stage... run. * thumb tip, handkerchief, watch it disappear * * are you ready? * here comes the magic * flash bib, a flame * now you see it, now you don't * * are you ready? * here comes the magic * everything you know is wrong * no matter what you do, I’m always one step ahead of you * * here comes the magic, flowing through my veins, frying all your brains with my prestidigitation * * here comes the magic, the sleight of hand * * you look away, and it's gone * stacked deck, double-back, pocketful of coins * * and I’m ready * here comes the magic * sponge balls, magic thread, now I’m in your head * * are you ready? * here comes the magic * everything you know is wrong * no matter what you say, I’m always hip to the games you play * * here comes the magic flowing through my veins, frying all your brains with my prestidigitation * * here comes the magic, the sleight of hand * * you look away, and it's gone * long gone * and nothing up my sleeve * can you believe i fooled you, fooled you? * * i feel the magic * hold it in my hands * try to understand * try to understand * here comes the magic, flowing through my veins, frying all your brains with my prestidigitation *
