Your grandpa wouldn't happen to be Master Son Gohan? Shut up! I did not know that the great master had a grandson. I had not found a decent opponent in ages I'll show you my special technique. What technique? It's my special technique. Your special technique? You're strong, but you're no match against the wolf's fang. Wolf Fang is worthless against my technique Rock-Paper, Scissors. That was a good nap... How can one be so pretty? Mr. Yamcha, do please wake up. I am dreaming! Of the prettiest girl! Look, this is a dragon ball. Owe my toes are so sore. But it looks like an egg. We just need to find three. Look, a ball dragon. A Dragon Ball ... And what is so important about these balls? If you gather the seven Dragon Balls a dragon will grant you a wish. It seems like a lie. No, what he says is true. When they go to sleep we will steal the Dragon Balls. Hey? Do not leave me here! Yamcha? What's wrong? Your'e in pain? Paur, I just saw something wonderful. I want to see it too. Paur! You can not see it. Once they have gathered all 7 we will steal the Dragon Balls. Help! Someone help me! Mr Yamcha im scared! Masenko! Puar? How? You can say that you are scared? I was scared. Here we go. Is incredible. They say that Mountain Fry Pan has a monster called Gyuma. It will be hard to find the ball. Gyuma could appear at any time. How? What is this Gyuma monster? They say it is terrifying. The devil himself. So? This is the castle of the Gyuma? Yes. We coul die at any time now. For real? The Radar says a ball is close, I'm sure we'll find a dragon ball there. But how do we get there? Wait here. I'll get my Kinto-un! Kinto-Un! Yamcha, I also wanna see. The fifth Dragon Ball must be in the Mountain Fry Pan. Sure. It's the monster! Were gonna die! Theives! What are you doing here? We were just taking a walk. Yeah, that, that. Heave you seen a young girl in a bikini and a helmet? We have not seen anything. Do not tell lies! I am sure that you kidnapped her! We are dead. We are lost. Look, it's Goku! What is this? A flying boy?! Fight, you coward! You're scared of me huh? You want to fight me? Come try my kung fu. I'm sorry, sorry! Haha! Look at silly Oolong. Who are you? Where did you get that cloud? The Turtle Hermit gave me it to me! The Turtle Hermit? No. Master Roshi? This same. Master Roshi was my teacher. You know where Master Roshi lives now? On the island of turtles. How good! If Master Roshi came here he could easily put out these flames. SO you assume that the old Roshi can put this fire? Do me a favor please. Go with your cloud and and go bring me Master Roshi. Wait? do you have anything like this here? Its similar to a ball with stars i have. If you bring me the master, it is yours. Another thing. This is my daughter Chi-Chi. L-Look, please. Perfect. Goku, go find them. You're the Chi-Chi. Right? How do you know my name? Your father is looking for you. You do not want to kidnap me? To kidnap? That means hijack right? Come on, we can go to my cloud. On a cloud? yeah look, follow me. Come on up. How do you want to ride on a marshmallow? Is it not something to eat? We have to leave, if you can ride Kinto-un. Are you a good girl? Of course. I'm better than an angel. Then, lets go. Come Up. Ughh. I have no strength. What's wrong? If someone pulls my tail I lose my strength. So.. Gokus weak point is his tail. I want to go from here. We will die like rats. I wanna leave. Master! Oh! It's you kid? Sure is Master! And who is the girl back there? It is the monster Gyuma's daughter. What? Gyuma daughter? For real? It's called Chi-Chi. Chi-Chi? Thats a funny name isnt it? That happens to be my name? Hey? And why have you come? Master? You can put out big flames right? Flames? I can with my magic fan. If you use one time causes a strong wind, if you use it twice causes rays. And if you use it three times, it rains, but, as you know of its existence? Theres a big fire on Mount Fry Pan that coudl get rid of the flames. Big fire huh? If you do not put out the fire, Gyuma can not go get the dragon ball we need. Tell us where you left the fan. Hmm? Crazy old man! What you hit me for? You've bitten my balls! Hey. Where is the magic fan? The wind took it the last time you used it. This is true. Goku sorry i forgot i dont have it anymore. What happens now to my? Damnit. Now we can't collect all the dragon balls. If I don't get the fan, Bulma and Oolong die. For real? Do not worry. I myself will put out the fire of Mount Fry Pan. -You? Yes! There is nothing I can not do! Thank you, Master. Come on. Goku, come here a moment. Of course there is also Bulma. Then we can go. But you already know you can not go up to the cloud. Do not joke. Turtle, you want to come, but I'll go with the other turtle. Gamera! But you ate the other turtle ... The Master is crazy. Come on, fly! Come on! Come on come on! Go Go! Master, is too heavy. I'll just wait five minutes! If not i will eat you for dinner! My daughter! Father! Master! Ouch. What you hit me for? Cause you are too slow turtle? Roshi! Shut up. Don't bother me. Come here a moment. You sit. Sit down, please. I do to want to. You will like. We had a deal. Hey, Master. I do not means to bother? Master, is in top form yes? You shut up! Can you extinguish the fire ? Wait your turn. I'm busy. Yes, quiet, please. If you can put out the fire I can get my castle I will be good and return everthign i stole. You smell good ... Quiet you there. Wow what a ride? What an old man. Master Roshi is a pervert. Okay, I'll put out the fire. Yes! Holy moly. That was amazing. To have so much power at that age? Lets go before they see us. Come on, Puar! Master, I want you to show me that attack. You could not perform it. You have to train for at least 50 years. 50 years? It can be done without training! What the, impossible. Now I think it's Gohan's grandson. What? Son Gohan's grandson? I still have much to assemlbe the last few grandpas. I had heard that he adopted a child and trained him. -Goku! Yes? Goku, you wanna come to my island. I'll teach you everything I know. 58701:17:51,000 --> 01:17:54,600 For real? Yes! Well come when we have found all the balls. Wait! Just a moment.

The true owner of the Dragon Balls is the powerful Emperor Pilaf. Take head! What? The powerful Pilaf? Go get the ball! Okay, Goku! great! They are truly lucky. What happened?

This is a real fight! Attention Bulma, you're about to see something magnificent. Watch out my cars cominh? Poor little children. Leave it in my hands. I'll take care of it all. There is no way.

Come on, let's go! Bulma, be careful. I think we've fallen into a trap. Emperor Pilaf, we could not find anything in the car. This means that one of them have them. And now we need to get out of here! Think of something! Hear! I am the great Emperor Pilaf. Stop hiding! Let us see you, do not be a coward! Give me the dragon balls and I'll let you live! We have no balls. Get us out of here and go look for yourself! I have warned you! What is this? It's gas! Finally the world will be all mine! So hungry so tired! If i had eaten could make bigger holes. And now what do we do? This Pilaf is trying to summon the dragon balls! So, what do we do now? Oolong. Why don't you become a bat? So you can fly out.
