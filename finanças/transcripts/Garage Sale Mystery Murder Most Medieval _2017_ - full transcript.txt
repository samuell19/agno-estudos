Mrs. Shannon. Please come in. Mr. Wallace is playing in the backyard. Thank you. Right this way, please. Ahh! Lives or dies? Lives. Well fought! Ah! Thanks for coming, Jenn. Of course! Would you like some tea? Sounds appropriate. Tucker, tea, please, for Jennifer and me. Let me get out of my armor and I'll meet you inside. Okay. Ahh! Good battle, gents. There are injuries, but nothing too major. The swords are thick and dull-edged. We wear a lot of padding. You guys just get together and beat each other up? We actually have a league. Those guys are all on my team. When we have a big competition, 40 knights can be fighting all at once. A ton of fun. Could someone substitute a real weapon at the last minute if they wanted to kill someone? Oh, no. The weapons are all checked before. And it wouldn't take long to find the guy with blood on his sword. Oh. It would make a great mystery. I've heard about you and mysteries. Let me show you why I asked you over. Oh. This way. Right in through here. You have so many lovely historical pieces. Thank you. This... Is 17th-century jacobean. Nice floral motifs... Silk inset cushion. Oh, it's beautiful. I'm looking for one to complement this. Doesn't have to be an exact match. That's not gonna be an easy find. If anybody can, you can. Thank you. And I'm assuming you want it authentic, and not a replica. This one is a replica, but don't tell anyone. Oh! The gauntlet is thrown by sir Rick. Oh! Tell sir Rick I accept. Battle calls. Keep an eye out for that chair. Will do. Thank you, Tucker. Go get them, sir. He's probably not coming back. Do you want to... Get outta here? Yes, thank you. This way. Maybe I should go. I skipped the last one. I feel kinda guilty. I love class reunions! Well, the one I went to, I thought I was at a big party with all my classmates' parents. Turned out I was with all my classmates! People can change a lot in 20 years. Mm-hmm. I'm probably not going. Four years of awkward adolescence doesn't require a lifetime commitment. Well, keep an open mind. You might have fun. Now, take a look at this. This is the kind of chair we're looking for. Okay. Yeah. Oh, hi. Why didn't you just call the plumber? This is a piece of cake. Back in college, you ran for class president, right? Yep, and I lost. Why'd you lose? 'Cause the other guy got more votes. Could you pass me the channel locks, please? Thank you. Was it horrible that you lost? No, I'm glad I lost. That's day I met your mother. Now watch this. Number for the plumber is on the fridge. I did the work. If I don't pass, I lose eligibility and I can't play. I'll lose my scholarship. Football is not an actual concern of mine. What is a concern is that your paper appears to have been copied off the Internet. Look. Tell me what you want me to do and I'll do it. I haven't made up my mind. Don't... do this. I'm telling you-- I'm sorry, are you threatening me, Mr. Sanders? When you... Make up your mind, you let me know. I'll do whatever. What is wrong with these guys? They think, because they catch a ball, they don't have to do the work? Well, not with me. So, how are those mid-terms coming along? Good, they're almost done. Excellent. I'm gonna need those by Friday, okay? Okay. You know, I think your dissertation may be overbroad. "The importance of the medieval epoch in the history of humanity"? I've been working on it for three years. Don't you think maybe-- why don't we grab some dinner tonight and, uh, you and I can talk about it some more? I can't tonight. I... I have a-a thing. "A thing"? -Yeah. -You sure? I really don't think that your wife would approve. Well, for what it's worth, we're getting divorced. Okay, you're gonna have to give me a little more credit than that. It's not the most original line, I'll grant you that, but it does happen to be true. Robert, I'm-- I'm so sorry. I had no idea. It happens. So... dinner? Sure. And I don't think my dissertation is overbroad. I think maybe the title... I was gonna cook dinner. What inspired you to get takeout? We can't use the sink. Why can't we use the sink? I'm replacing the faucet, so the water's shut off. Mm. Well, you know, the plumber's number's on the fridge. Oh, yeah, thanks. I saw a real medieval battle today. Really? With, like, knights and armor and everything? -Mm-hmm. -Where? Oh, a client's house. He stages battles in his backyard. That sounds so cool. No. No, what? No, you can't join in. Can I watch sometime? Maybe. Yeah. I think Hannah wants to run for class president. Really? Wow! That's great. Do you remember when you ran? Yes, and I lost. I remember you sitting in the quad, feeling sorry for yourself. I wasn't really that upset. But then I saw this cute girl walking across, and I thought, if I look sad and forlorn, she might walk over to me and cheer me up. Oh, is that what happened? It's how I remember it. That's funny, I haven't even turned out the lights and you're already dreaming. That's a good one! Goodnight. Goodnight. Love you. I love you, too. All right, I was a little sad and forlorn. I know. No books. They're heavy and they smell up the store. Oh, but some of these could be treasures. This is an Agatha Christie. Oh, okay, no books. I'm gonna go upstairs. I'll go downstairs. Amazing, isn't it? It's incredible. I want to buy it, but I have to check something with someone first. Could hold it for me? I'll give you full asking. At an estate sale, cash is king. It's first-come, first-serve. Okay. Well, I'll be back. Hey, Sharon. Great sale. Thanks, Jenn. I have a customer that might be interested in this, but $1,000 is a little steep, especially for a reproduction. That's a great price. I already have someone who's interested. Oh, you mean the buyer that just left? I have cash, right here, right now, $500. $1,000. Worth every penny! Well, I have to sell it and make money, too. Give me a better number. Seven. -Eight. -Sold. Super! It's heavy. Oh! Wow! This mace is impressive. I'd like to have this around the house for self-defense. I think pepper spray might be easier. So, where is the knight going in the store? Oh, he's not going in the store. I already have a buyer. Hey! Yes, I got it. I can bring it by today. Perfect! Dani, I'm gonna drop you off at the store. Are you having fun? I am. I think it works. I think you're gonna start a trend. $1,500 is cheap! Are you being fair to yourself? I could charge you more, if you like. It's okay, Bill. I look forward to your repeat business. Well, the details are amazing! Best I've ever seen on a reproduction. The patina is beautiful. It's 100 years old. How old would a real one be? 400 to 500 years. Ooh. Where are you gonna put him? Right over here. "Sir Rags-to-Riches," I'll call him. Oh! I'm flattered. Could you get that? Mm-hmm. If it's Jeremy? Busy. I need to see Emma. She's working on her dissertation, Jeremy. Would you just get her for a moment, please? -Look, she's busy and-- -I got it, Meg. Can I come in? I really need to work. Emma, please. We broke up, right? -I know. -And we said-- ...that we were going to give each other some space. I can't stop thinking that it was a mistake. I'm sorry, okay? About all of it-- the anger, the possessiveness. I get it now. Let's give us another chance. I really need to focus on my dissertation. You know that, and I have orals coming up and... I just don't want to be in a relationship right now. Really? Is that why you're seeing professor McNary? What? What are you talking about? I've seen you together. We work together! At dinner? You need to go. You're seeing him, aren't you? I'm not seeing anybody! And if I was, it wouldn't be any of your business! Now go. Ahh. What do you think? Very nice. Sandy and Terry! Wow! Well, welcome to Rags to Riches. Gosh! It's been quite a while. Yes, it's good to see you, Dani. And you're right. It has been quite a while. We were just out shopping and we drove by the store. Sandi said, "isn't that where Dani works?" This is... cute! I've never been in. Well, if you like old, we're the place. Mm. I can see that. Anyway, are you coming to the class reunion? Oh, yeah, I'm gonna try and make it. Oh, well, we'd love to see you there. Well, we better run! Okay, well, bye, girls. -Bye! -Bye! See? That's why I don't want to go to these things! But you just said you were going. Oh, no, no. I just said that to them. I can't possibly go. The whole experience just came flooding back to me. Is that the chair? Yeah, it is. Well, where did you find it? Stafford antiques. It's pretty good, huh? It's perfect. Okay. I did it. I'm officially running for senior class president, and I want your sage advice. Oh, that's great! It'll give me a chance to redeem myself. You think you can win? I don't know. Well, rumor is that Tootie Trayner might run. And? And she's popular, she's beautiful, talented and... Very determined. That's not a problem, 'cause you're popular, beautiful, talented, and very determined, too. I love you, dad. But it's still gonna be tough. So what do you suggest? Hello. Welcome to Rags to Riches. Can I help you with anything? Actually, yes. I'm professor Robert McNary. I teach medieval studies. A friend of mine saw a suit of armor for sale. She placed a hold on it, I rushed over, and it was gone. The woman said I should talk with you. We did buy it. Well, even though it's a reproduction, it will make a wonderful teaching tool. Now, I can pay you $3,000... It's already been sold. Never even made it to the store. Ah, that's disappointing. Could you tell me who bought it? Well, I can't do that. That would violate customer confidentiality. Of course. I understand. Could you call and perhaps ask if-- for educational purposes-- they might be willing to sell it? Yes. That I can do. Oh. Hi, it's Jenn. I have a customer here in the store who's interested in buying your suit of armor. Are you sure? It's for quite a bit more. Okay, thank you. That was the buyer. He is not interested in selling at any price, I'm sorry. I see. Well, I guess this is the one that got away. Thank you for your help. You're welcome. Oh... $3,000. Wow. I have an announcement. I'm officially running for senior class president, and dad's gonna help. Oh, honey, that's great. You ran for class office, right, dad? Yes, he did, and if he hadn't, you might not be here now. It's a long story, son, but, yes, I did. What about a slogan? Oh, how about this? "Vote for Hannah. She's the one. Give her your votes, she'll get things done." Mm... Okay, what do you guys have? How about, um... "Don't monkey around... Vote Hannah banana for president." Definite "no." Dad... What was your slogan when you ran? "Jason's the best, forget the rest." Ah, catchy. I think we need to keep looking. It got your mom. Hey, Dani. Hey! Well, there's a garage sale in Montclair this Friday. You on? Yeah. Friday works. Dani, did you open this file? No, I just got here. Um, Bill Wallace called, and he said this morning would be good to bring over that chair. Oh, great! Will you help me? Yeah. So you know the salt-and-pepper set? Yeah, the Wilton? Yeah. Sold it. Online sale. See? That is the future of our business. No more rent, just put it on the website. They look great together. Exactly what I had in mind. Date or no date? -No date. -Most don't. Still, wonderful. Oh, you got him up! Your knight looks great. Doesn't he? I'm the envy of my fight club. Everybody wants one. Hard to find. Mm. Wish I could've tried him on, but it just didn't fit. But it fit Tucker! Very handsome, Tucker! Thank you, ma'am. -Well done, Tucker. -Nice shots, sir. Thank you, Tucker. Well... Identifying the victim wasn't that difficult. Still had his wallet. Robert McNary. Professor of medieval history at Capay College. Do any of you know him? I do. What? I mean... Sort of. He came into the shop. He wanted to buy the suit of armor. He wanted to know the buyer's information. I wouldn't give it to him. So how did he get it? Well... When I was on the phone with Bill, McNary was standing right there. He must have seen me take the number from the receipt. So are you saying that he wanted the armor so badly, that he broke into your shop, got the address, and came here to steal it? That had to be what happened. And there are about eight members to your team? Yes, but you're not thinking any of them might be involved? You're part of a group whose idea of a good time is to beat on each other with swords, axes, and maces. You do use maces in these mock battles, right? Yes, sometimes. I'll definitely be looking into it. I'll give you their names and numbers. Okay. How much is that armor worth? Well, supposedly, it's a reproduction, so around $1,500. Yet, he breaks into your store and then into this house, for a suit of armor you can buy on the Internet? Actually, not. This suit is exquisitely detailed. It could pass for a real one. Well, how much would it be worth? If you could find one? Somewhere between $50,000 and $100,000. Okay, well, there's the motive. He obviously thought it was the real thing. So, who's our killer, and why did he leave the armor? Sir, looks as if a crowbar or something was used to pry open the window. This house doesn't have an alarm? It does, we just don't use it. Why? Too many false alarms. I feel confident enough to deal with an intruder. The medical examiner puts the time of death at around 3:00 A.M. Where were you two at that time? I was home. Asleep. I wasn't. And where were you? My night off. I was at my girlfriend's. Do you find it a bit odd someone breaks into your house and a murder takes place, and you sleep through the whole thing? Not really. My bedroom door is made of solid oak. It's quiet as a tomb in there. You were right. Nothing's been taken, nothing's been touched, but the back window was jimmied. I didn't touch a thing. That where you got the phone number for Wallace? Yes. I noticed it was slightly open when I got here this morning. What is it about people and alarms? I know you have one. So...? It's been broken for a while. We have the sticker. Yeah, we have a sticker! But we're gonna get it fixed. Forensics is coming over here after they finish with the Wallace house. Let's grab a bite. We need to talk. I need to question you as part of my investigation. You mean, like, "formal" questioning? Here, in the diner? Well, if you prefer, we can go down to the station. Oh, you're serious, aren't you? Mm. When did you first see this suit of armor? Last weekend at an estate sale. Sharon Thompson runs it. There was a young woman there-- Name? I don't know. She wanted to buy the armor, but needed to check with someone first. She left, I bought it. I knew that Bill Wallace would be interested. And when did professor McNary come into the store? That was yesterday. He must have asked Sharon who bought the armor. My guess is McNary is who the woman had to speak with before buying. So, you had never seen McNary before he came in your store? No. And where were you last night at 3:00 A.M.? Really? Just answer the question, please. I was home, in bed, with my husband, Jason. That's j-a-s-- Yes, I know how to spell "Jason". Thank you very much, Mrs. Shannon. Okay, end of interview. Let's eat. I can't believe it. I-It doesn't even feel real. We're all devastated. The entire department's just in shock. I can't imagine how this must be for you. Thank you. I'm not really sure what to do now. That's one of the things I need to talk to you about. I need someone to take over professor McNary's two intro classes. Would you be interested in finishing the semester as an instructor instead of a T.A.? -Uh-- -I understand-- ...this is a lot to handle right now. If you think that I can do it, then I will. I know you can do it, professor McNary spoke very highly of you. I hate to even mention this, but... What happens with my own work? Professor McNary was my dissertation advisor and I'm almost done. I will be your new advisor and chairing the orals committee. So, don't let this derail you, you'll be fine. Thank you. Hey, hon'. Hey! How was your day? Something interesting happened today. There was this suit of armor and this college professor wanted to buy it and... ...he ended up murdered... In the suit of armor. Well, that's sort of what happened. I know. I spoke with Frank. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. And that-that has me concerned. I mean, am I becoming too callous? What do you think? I don't know. Here I am, looking at this dead body, and all I could think of is, "who killed him? Why?" "And why put him in the suit of armor? And why not take the suit of armor?" You saw it as a mystery that needed to be solved. Exactly. I don't think that's being callous, I think you're looking for justice for the victim. I'm gonna go with that. So... How'd he die? Mace. You can die from being sprayed by mace? No. He was hit by a mace. Yeah, that'll do it. So good, what is it? Well, it started off as stroganoff. But now it's not so stroganoff. You know I could take you to the dinner to the place they have the knife --- Funny. Tell Logan dinner will be ready in 30 minutes. All right. This is hilarious! The clothes you guys wore! We thought we looked pretty good. But the hair... The hair's priceless. Okay. You wanna know a secret? What's that? The way you look now-- the clothes, the hair, everything-- one day, will be the funniest thing in the world. Guaranteed. It'll never be like that. Well... So, are you going to go? Maybe the next one. Whether this is 100 or 500 years old... It's magnificent! Patina is gorgeous! Some of the leather straps are not original. That's expected, though. Edges are finished correctly to period. This armor is correct to the 15th century. I'd date it around 1480-- Italian, Milanese design. This is an exceptional and extraordinary piece. What is the estimated value? At auction, I would expect this could bring close to $100,000. He said it's not a reproduction. That armor is 500 years old and could be worth up to $100,000. That changes everything. The young woman at the estate sale must have guessed that it was real and took the pictures to McNary. He's a college professor, right? He doesn't break into houses and steal things, even for a hundred grand. And if the suit is so valuable, why leave it behind? And who was with McNary that night? It had to be the killer. Really? Are you sure McNary didn't go there alone? Well, that would mean the killer was already there. So, then you're talking about Wallace or Tucker. Tucker had the night off, and why wouldn't Wallace just call the police and say he was attacked by an intruder? I have no idea. But what I do know is he's now $100,000 richer. I was thinking about going out to the college, you know, talk to some people. If you sense anything dangerous or suspicious, you don't push it. Let me know. I'll push it. All right. I gotta go. Looks like McNary's wife is back in town. I've got my slogan. What do you think? "Vote for Hannah. "Eat well, be well. Students for healthy choice." Go on. We've got a student garden. It's all organic, but the school won't let us provide fresh vegetables to the campus cafeterias. Why not? They say there's liability issues, but other schools are doing it. Okay, well, that's a great start. You have a clear campaign issue. Right. So... what did you learn during your campaign? Be yourself. Don't make a promise you can't keep. Introduce yourself to students you don't know, and ask for their vote. Just be bold? Yeah. "Hi, I'm Hannah, running for class president. Can I count on your vote?" You convert one voter, they'll convert three. You tried this when you ran? No, the guy who won did. So, what do you think? Yes, very creative Logan. It's a start, but let's drop the faces. OK, back to the drawing board then. You're the best. Hi. My name is Jennifer Shannon. Hi. Emma Mitchell. Well... Did you work with professor McNary? Yes. I was his teaching assistant. I'm sorry about what happened. It's horrible. Are-- are you a friend of his? Oh, uh, may I? Of course. I only recently met him. Did I see you at the estate sale? The one with the suit of armor? Yes! Yes. I was taking pictures to show professor McNary. It was the best reproduction I've ever seen. Do you have any idea why he would break into someone's house to steal something, especially a reproduction? No. Do you know of anyone who might have wanted to harm him? No. N-Not really. There was a student who was angry about a grade. But you don't kill someone over that. Why are you so interested in this? I bought the suit of armor and I own the store where professor McNary came. Guess I just feel connected somehow. This must be so hard. How are you doing? I'm not great. Uh... We worked very closely together. He was my dissertation advisor. So... I got lunch. This is my boyfriend, Jeremy. Uh, this is Jennifer Shannon, she bought the armor at the estate sale. Oh. It's nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. This is all... I think there's more to this story than we've been told. I think you're right. Why would the professor risk his academic career by being a thief? Maybe he'd want a book, but a suit of armor? Not Robert. And breaking into a house? No! I need to ask you a few questions. These are routine for any spouse of a murder victim. I understand. For the record-- where were you the night of Monday, April 7th? In Seattle. With my sister's family. Do you know of anyone who wanted to harm your husband? Other than me? Students he flunked? Women he had affairs with? You care to expand on that? Don't get me wrong. You said "harm," not kill. Students could get very upset about their grades. Hmm. Are there any students in particular who had an animosity towards professor McNary? I wouldn't know by name. You mentioned yourself. Oh... I was being facetious. I'm sorry, terribly sorry, that this happened to him. I filed for divorce three weeks ago. It's been bad for the last few years. He was unfaithful on more than one occasion. Do you know with who? Not recently, no. But he loved being a professor and the adulation of the female students. And how are you doing financially? We have debts. My husband may have been a respected teacher, but he was a horrible investor. The divorce would've made things worse. My sister's husband is an attorney, so my legal fees are free. His are not. So is there anything you can think of that can help us with this investigation? Absolutely nothing. My husband, a respected medieval scholar, gets murdered while robbing a house? What could I add? Thank you. Dani? Layla! Oh, my goodness! How are you? Good! Good. So, are you going to the reunion? Oh... probably not. Yeah, you couldn't pay me. I mean, you know, the people I want to see, I can see them anyway. That's my feeling. Huh. You know, some of the "art kids" are getting together for sort of an alternate reunion. An anti-reunion reunion? Exactly. Hmm. Where are you having it? We have a private room at the golden dragon. You know, you should come. That actually sounds like fun. Great! I hope to see you there. Bye. Bye, Layla. Any updates on the murder? I asked detective Lynwood the same thing. All he says is that the investigation is still ongoing. When do you think I'll get my mace back? Could be a while. It's evidence. Uh, here's what I wanted to show you. This blade has been taken off the wall and put back. How do you know? The blade has a decorative scroll on the one side. That's the side I display. It's now facing the wall. On the night McNary was killed, somebody removed the sword. How do you know it was that night? Why not the month before? Tell her. Knowing the suit of armor was arriving, Mr. Wallace had me take photos of the room. We like to document the evolution of the display as well as for insurance, of course. This sword was moved on the night of the break-in. Has anyone touched that sword? No one. Then there might be a fingerprint. Frank? No prints on the mace handle? Oh, it's not a smooth surface, so either the killer used gloves or wiped the armor down. There's no prints there. Okay, I think I got it. Take a look. We got three distinct latent prints on the sword. Let me guess. Bill Wallace, the homeowner, Daniel Tucker, his Butler, and the recently deceased Robert McNary. Correct. Are Wallace and Tucker suspects? Everyone's a suspect. That makes it simple. Case closed. How's that? The butler did it. Bye, Sam. That's funny! "The butler did it." I like him! So, what do we know? McNary broke into the house with intentions of stealing the armor. You assume that intention. We just know he broke into the house. What else? We know he removed the sword. Yeah, but we don't know why. Or who put it back. You said McNary's wife thought there was a student with a grudge, right? I'm going through the school records, seeing if anything jumps out. I wish Sam hadn't said that. -Said what? - That the butler did it. I'd never hear the end of it. Right. Right. Can't believe this. Prof. McNary. What a loss. It is a loss. I agree. You're, uh, teaching the class now, so, what happens to my grade is up to you, right? Yeah, that's true. All I want is a chance. I've been reading. Middle ages are actually kinda cool, with knights and chivalry and battles everywhere. The fighting is not all that different from football, except we don't have weapons, but we have the chaos of battle. I like it. Okay, listen. I don't want to be played or taken advantage of, because this is my first time teaching. Be honest with me. You weren't upset about McNary's death, were you? He tried to ruin my life. The guy had it out for me. Okay, I want you to write me a paper for extra credit. What on? Dr. Tramell. Jennifer! I brought cookies. Mm... cookies! Now... Let me ask you this. Why was sir Lancelot always tired? Oh, no. He worked the knight shift. Ah! Okay, well, now that we got that over with, I assume McNary's cause of death was trauma to the head? Yes. My first mace murder, and a very effective weapon. Is there anything else that might have contributed to his death? Possibly. The blow from the mace came from behind. However, he did have an injury to the jaw which occurred shortly before his death, an injury consistent with a blow from a fist. Are you saying that someone hit him in the face and then someone else hit him from behind with the mace? No, I'm saying there was a round bruise, like that from a fist. He could have fallen face-forward and then injured his jaw as he hit the floor, but it's doubtful the contusion would be so nicely spherical. Can you tell if the person who swung the mace was right- or left-handed? And what about height? I think it was a downward blow, which doesn't indicate left or right. And as to height, the extension of the arm makes an estimation impossible. So, if the blow to the face came from the front, and the mace blow from the back, could there have been two attackers? Maybe... But he may have lived for a couple of minutes after the mace blow. A single killer could have struck him with a fist after the mace. Right. My first customer wearing a suit of armor. Ahh... may he rust in peace. Oh, dear. Thank you. Whoa... Look at this. What? I got an email from a guy I went to high school with. I had a big crush on him. Ooh... He wants to know if I'm going to the reunion. But you're not going, right? Well, that's not written in stone. Chris Stoddard. Chris Stoddard. He is cute. He played guitar. Wrote songs. Even wrote poetry. Did you date him? I wanted to, but he always had a girlfriend. Mm. Well, what's he up to now? You know, I don't know. I guess I could go to the reunion and find out. Mm-hmm! Hi, Hannah. Hi, Tootie. Welcome. Anything I can help you with? Actually, yes. I hear you're running for class president. I am. That's great. I am, too. I've already got the Greek council's endorsement, and a ton of other support. I've heard. But I had a thought. Tell me. If you were to pull out and endorse me, I would fully support you as president of the student council. That's a win-win. I think I'm gonna keep my options open. Oh, no problem. I just wanted to let you know. Bye! Bye. Oh, you've got to win. By a landslide! Twice. Did you ever talk with that football player? Sanders? Yeah. Yeah, I did. Professor McNary was going to flunk him, and now he wants a second chance. Did he ever threaten the professor? I was in the office when professor McNary said that he was gonna flunk him, and Sanders got really angry. I mean, he controlled it, but... He left in a hurry. Do you think McNary would have reported that to the administration? I mean, is it on record somewhere? He might have done that. I could get the police to check it out. I'm going to the library. Okay. We'll see you later. I'm so sorry we ever broke up. I feel so safe with you. I take the bar in a year. What if we... get married after? I mean, it's gonna be a crazy year with my dissertation and-and orals, but... But maybe it would be good to have something to look forward to. Yes. Or we could just do it. I mean, why wait? After all this, I can't imagine being apart. Jenn. If I help you solve this, will you come back to bed? Go for it. Mm. You've got a college professor who's robbing a house, right? Yes. He thinks the suit of armor is real and worth a small fortune. And he needs the money that badly, why? He was in debt. He was getting divorced. His wife had access to a top lawyer, he didn't. So who are the suspects? Could be anyone-- an angry student, Bill Wallace, the owner of the home, the professor's wife, Anne. Wife's a good bet. Was she out of town? Yes. So, she hires a killer to do the deed while she's gone, perfect alibi. What kind of hitman follows his victim into a house and assumes there'll be a convenient mace there to hit him with? Doesn't sound like a professional hit to me. Yeah, you're right. The homeowner has a butler? Don't say it. What? If you don't say it, I'll come back to bed. Deal. The quarterback...fake the throw, he hands it off to me, I run it down-- 60-yard touchdown, I win the game. Excuse me. Tim Sanders? I'd like to ask you a few questions regarding professor McNary. I didn't do it. I didn't say you did. The administration gave me some names for some students who were on academic warning from professor McNary. Okay. Here's the deal, detective. I'm a student-athlete. Spend a lot of time at practice, traveling to games, working out. Doesn't leave a whole lot of time for homework. You still need to maintain a certain GPA, correct? Yeah. But some profs are cool about it. Not the late, great professor McNary, though. Where were you on the night of April 7th? That's the night he died, right? Mm-hmm. I was in my apartment, alone. That's your alibi? I repeat. Wasn't me. I'm gonna be late for practice, all right? One more question. Did you threaten professor McNary when he said he wouldn't change your grade? No way! Who told you that? Professor McNary wrote down that you were visibly upset when you left his office. Why wouldn't I be upset? The guy was trying to flunk me. I really gotta go. Okay. Good luck on Saturday. What's Saturday? Your game. Right. Tootie is trying to buy the election. Who doesn't want free fries? Well, I mean, you could offer a free burger. That's not the point, Logan. Besides, it'd cost a fortune. Okay, well, then where did she get the money from? Her dad is some big lawyer. Hey, maybe you could just set up a table around campus and give out free veggies. You know, like, uh... "A vote for Hannah is a vote for health." That's not bad. That clearly differentiates the campaigns. "Fries versus veggies." Thanks, Logan. Hey, um... Do you mind if I keep this flyer? Nice try. Stop by the table and I'll give you a carrot. Great. I'm with you. Yeah. Fries. Hey. Tim. You scared me to death. What do you-- what do you want? I finished the extra credit paper. Oh. Okay. There was a detective on campus this morning asking about the murder. Why is he talking to me? From what I understand, he got a list of students who might've been on academic probation. That grade wasn't final yet. I'm not on academic probation. Well, perhaps it was a memo that professor McNary left. When you left, he was very upset. I didn't do anything to him! I got up and walked out. Did you tell him that I threatened professor McNary? I didn't tell them anything. If my name is tied to a murder, pro teams are going to pass. Do you get that? Are you threatening me? Take it any way you want. Don't talk about me to the police. Did you tell him that I threatened professor McNary? Good morning! -Hi, sweetheart. -I'm off. -Have a great day! -You too. -Oh! Bye. -Seeya. Gotta run. Oh, have a good one, honey. Oh! Take a bagel. Ahh... Non-negotiable. I'm trying to lose weight. You look great. Morning, mom. Can't stop. Oh. Wait. Are you sure? Yeah. See you later. Logan, French toast? Okay, maybe just a minute. Logan, have you ever seen one of those, uh, crime scene animations? Yeah, it's the same software I used to make that dance video. Can you recreate a crime? Okay, that's not fair. You give me French toast, then ask me to do stuff. Oh, but that's good, isn't it? That is real maple syrup. Okay. When do you need it? Is it weird to have had a crush on somebody all those years ago and still feel the same way? Have you even spoken with him? No, not yet, just emails back and forth. Jeremy? Is everything okay? Do you have a minute? Sure. What's going on? I don't really know who to talk to. Emma and I had broken up, but we're back together now. Professor McNary's death made us realize how much we need each other. But... She's having a hard time dealing with it. It can be very traumatic. She thinks she's somehow at fault because she found the suit of armor at the estate sale. I understand, but she's not. I know, but not knowing who the killer is, is scary. Could it be someone we know? I mean, should we be worried? The police are doing everything they can. Is there someone that Emma suspects? There's a student, an athlete, who was gonna lose his eligibility if McNary flunked him. Emma's now teaching him, and to tell you the truth, she's frightened. What would you like me to do? Talk to her, maybe? If you think it'll help, I'm happy to. He was waiting for her in the parking lot last night. He thinks that Emma was talking to the police about him. Do you think he's dangerous? I don't know. Maybe I'm overreacting, but I think it would just be good if she had someone to talk to. Of course. Thank you. What's wrong? Nothing. I'm fine. Well, something's wrong. Is it Jeremy? Look. I know that it felt safer to go back with him after professor McNary died, but you broke up with him for a reason. He wants to get married. Oh, Emma... You don't have to do that. Maybe I do. Typed label, no return address... So mysterious. I wonder what it could be. Open it up. Looks like... A part of a t-shirt, and the number 16. That's weird. Not as weird as this. That looks like dried blood. We'll know about the blood stains in a moment, but we've got to figure out the significance of the number "16." Well, I had a hunch. I printed this off from the team website. What a coincidence. Whatcha got, Sam? No doubt about it. The blood on this shirt was once flowing through the veins of professor Robert McNary. This certainly won't hold up in a court of law. Sanders sure has motive. McNary was going to flunk him. No more scholarship. I talked to the coach. He's got a good chance at going pro. That goes out the window, too. And he threatened McNary. Emma Mitchell has given him a chance to get his grade up, so, McNary's death has worked out for him, in that sense. Her boyfriend, Jeremy, came to see me. Sanders was upset after you talked to him, was waiting for Emma in the parking lot. She's a little frightened. So maybe she should be. We know the blood on the shirt is McNary's. And the note has Sanders' uniform number, suggesting that he's the killer. Which may or not be true. Okay, but assume the killer was wearing the shirt. That means someone knows the killer well enough to get the shirt and tip us off. Okay. Well, I'm gonna have to go back to the school. Oh, do you have a problem with Bill Wallace helping me with one of my scenarios? Well, he's not high on my list of suspects. I don't think there's any connection. So, it's okay? I know nothing about it. Perfect! Anyplace in particular you'd like us to stand? Right here is probably fine. Now, we know McNary had the sword because of the fingerprints. I assume he was facing off with the guy who was holding the mace. But how did the fatal blow end up on the back of McNary's head? Hmm... You're about to see. This is one of our training weapons. It still hurts, so I'll try not to hit him too hard. Very much appreciated, sir. The police... Were kind enough to return this. So, the professor has the sword. Mm. And the bad guy has the mace. Swing at me, Tucker! Now, just to be clear... If I kill you, I will be out of a job, sir. Jenn, you're a witness. If he kills me, he can have the house. Very good. Could you repeat that? Repeat that? And he's dead. Well, that explains that. It's actually quite difficult to strike someone with a sword like this. Mace is much easier to use for a novice. And what if the guy with the mace is an athlete? All the better. Yeah. I guess I'll see you then. Okay, bye-bye. That was Chris. He called. His voice sounds exactly the same! It was like I was 17 again. Dani! I know, I'm being silly. I'm a grown woman. What did he say? Well, he said that he'd thought about me a lot over the years, and-and it was fun, it was like no time had passed at all. Oh! Well, did you tell him you're not going to go to the reunion? No, not exactly, 'cause he asked me to go with him and have dinner beforehand. And you said? Well, I'm not going to miss my class reunion. Of course not. Why would you? That's what I thought. That's why I'm asking. Did Tim Sanders threaten you? I am currently teaching two classes. For a PH.D. candidate, that is a very big opportunity, and the last thing I need right now is to get in the middle of a dispute with the athletic department. A man lost his life, Emma. The stakes are higher than a teaching opportunity. Did he threaten you? I felt threatened. I can't say that he actually threatened me. I don't believe Tim is a killer. Did Jeremy go talk with you? He talked to Jennifer Shannon. What did he say to you, Emma? He approached me in the parking lot. I recorded the conversation on my phone. I could download it, and send it to you, and you can decide. All right. There's something else. He just handed this in. It seems a little odd, given what happened. Okay. This is big. I'm behind in the polls? No. I looking around on the net, and discovered some interesting things about your opposition. About Tootie? Yeah. First, I got her bio from her campaign website, and then I went a little deeper in the net. Uh-oh. Her father is deceased, he was never a lawyer. Her high school GPA is lower, and her stepfather runs a sports betting place. Wow. Now we know where all that French fry money came from. If even half of this is true, Tootie not only would forfeit the election, she could be kicked out of school. This is her high school's administration office number. You should call it. She's a fraud. So I'm in here. It's temporary, I'm told. Don't ask. I'm not asking. So... what you got? Tramell said the blow came from behind. But McNary had the sword, I assume, to defend himself, which would have him facing the killer. Whoa. Hold on a sec. What's the scenario? Oh, I can't prove it, but this is what I think happened. Can you pop that in your computer? I had Logan do a simulation. McNary's on the left, the killer is on the right. If they're going after the armor, why did the killer leave it? Because what started out as burglary somehow ended up a murder. The killer panicked. All he wanted to do is buy some time, so he puts the body in the armor, lifts it back up on the stand, he wipes it down for prints, and gets out of there. So who's our killer? Someone who knows McNary, and is willing to commit a crime with him. Or... is coerced into it. And is strong enough to lift McNary's dead weight. That's a paper Tim Sanders wrote for Emma Mitchell. "Football and medieval warfare"? It's about the similarities of a medieval battleground and a football game. Rates the effectiveness of weapons in close quarters. The mace is at the very top. So, what are you saying? Am I under arrest? Nope. Just asking for your cooperation. Then I don't have to go down to the station with you? Here's how it works, Tim. People who are innocent, well, they usually want to help. And people who have something to hide... Fine. I'm happy to help. You can come down after practice. I'll be expecting you. I told the chief he's our best bet. If I think we have enough evidence, I'll arrest him, get a warrant, and go through his place. You already have the murder weapon, right? What do you think you'll find at his place? Well, hopefully, a white t-shirt with a piece missing, or any other article of clothing with blood splatter. A pair of shoes, anything. Sorry about the delay, Tim. Also, just wanna let you know that we will be recording this. You know, this doesn't feel like I'm here to help. Well, anything that can help us solve the case is a help. Let me ask you this, first. How much do you bench press? Lift overhead? What's that got to do with anything? Just answer the question. Uh, I bench 200. 180 overhead. You know, I don't want to get too bulked up, I need to be fast. And you could potentially turn pro, correct? Got to prove myself next season, senior year. And if you were to leave school, that would hurt your chances? It'd kill my chances. Did professor McNary tell you that he was going to flunk you? My final grades go in end of the semester, so he could've changed his mind, given me extra credit, whatever, just to get me over that hump. So... in a sense... Professor McNary could determine your future. McNary filed a report and said that you'd threatened him. I didn't do that. Still... The report is in your file. How much was it worth to you to pass that class? You just said it. It's my future. So, if McNary had asked you to do something... Something that would help you change your grade... You'd probably do it. Even if it meant stealing something? What? What are you talking about? This is stupid. I'm outta here. Sit yourself down, Tim! You have motive. You have the strength. McNary could coerce you, and you have no alibi. That's correct? You have no alibi? What does this mean to you? That's my number. What's this? It's a piece of a t-shirt, with McNary's blood on it. It was sent it in with that piece of paper, with your number on it. So... Someone is trying to tell us that you killed professor McNary. I want a lawyer. Well, that's a good idea... Because you're under arrest. It was just an arrest. He hasn't been charged. Unless we find something solid, he'll probably get released. How long can you hold him? Ah, a few days, at best. I mean, the arrest was mainly just to shake him up. Do you still need a warrant? No, he gave me permission to search his apartment. Heading over there now. That doesn't sound like someone who's guilty. Or maybe somebody who's confident that there's no evidence there. He said something interesting. What's that? Well, that he claims he owns no white shirts, that all his t-shirts are provided to him by the athletic dept. None of them are white. Meet me back here in two hours, and I'll tell you what I find. Okay. So, she made up a complete alter-ego? She's not even close to being the person she represents herself to be. Yeah, and it could be a problem for her. Logan found this out? And I verified. I even talked to someone at Tootie's high school. I'm surprised they'd even talk with you. They wouldn't, initially. And it was off the record. Someone in administration? One of the guidance counselors. She thought that if I knew some of Tootie's background, it might explain it. It doesn't excuse it, but she's overcome a lot. Like what? She moved around a lot as a kid. Her father was home ill, and she was his caretaker. He passed away in her senior year. Her mom was working two jobs, just to keep the family going. You got a real dilemma. Yeah. I don't say anything, and she wins the election. I tell the truth, and she maybe gets kicked out of school. I don't know. Election day's after tomorrow. ...I don't know. I told you, right? Yeah. No white t-shirts. Only athletic-issue. Come on. Let's go. No bloody shoes or gloves, or whatever else you thought you might find? Apartment was as clean as a whistle. Let's go. Come on. Look for a guy who wears white t-shirts. It was a hail Mary. I knew he wasn't dumb enough to leave evidence in his apartment. So what if the school didn't give him white t-shirts? Doesn't mean he didn't have one. You're right. So let's look at other possibilities. Okay, then. There's Emma Mitchell, his assistant. All of a sudden, she's getting promoted and taking over his classes. I mean, for a PH.D. candidate, that's quite a coup. Do you believe that? No. She also doesn't have the upper-body strength to lift McNary up onto a stand. Which leads us back to Sanders, who could do it easily. Yep. Hi... Hey. What are these? These are some old things that I'm thinking of wearing to the reunion. Old things? They have price tags. Okay, maybe I did a little shopping. Um, what do you think of this? Oh, that might be a little dressy for a reunion. What about this? Maybe. Or this. Yeah. That could work. But I'd need new shoes. Oh, that goes without saying. Sanders was never formally charged. They had to release him. That's not good. Frank's keeping an eye on him. Trying to build a case. Do you think they've let a killer go? Maybe. Sorry. I got hung up at school. Leftovers are in the fridge. Did you make a decision about Tootie? I did. I'm not gonna say a thing. Let the chips fall where they will. Well, I'm proud of you. And who knows. You may still win. Doubt it. Everyone's looking forward to French fries. How could they just let him go? It's up to the D.A. If he doesn't think he has enough evidence to convict, he won't keep him. Are you worried? Yeah, I'm worried! Who knows what he could do? I just saw Sanders on campus. I can't believe he's not in jail. They don't have enough evidence. Did she tell you? Tell me what? Well, in the midst of all this craziness-- something good. Emma and I are getting married. Oh! Well, congratulations! Thank you. And, as far as Tim Sanders, just be careful. I will be. Sanders has a girlfriend? Yeah. I talked to her, a couple friends, teammates. I don't think any of them sent the package. Then who? Not sure. But forensics has the package now. We'll see. Where was it mailed from? Post office near campus. It's possible the sender was caught on the security cam. It's a lot of footage. We're working on it. How was Emma? Emma's on edge and worried about Sanders, but there's something else. I can't put my finger on it. Hmm. Hi, detective Lynwood. Hello, Hannah. We'll talk later. Okay. Well? I lost. Oh! Tootie won. Well, you don't seem too upset about that. Mm, I'm not. I'm actually kinda happy for Tootie. What do you think? Cute. They're for the reunion. I'm meeting Chris for dinner, beforehand. Mm! They're great. Okay, I've got to go and get my hair done. Oh! Have fun! Good luck! She seems awful excited about having dinner with a guy she hasn't seen since high school. Well, you never know. Hmm. Dani! Chris? Yeah, its Chris! Wow! Have a seat, have a seat. Big glass of Merlot for the lady! -I bought a bottle. -Oh-- table should be ready soon. Wow... after all these years. After all these years. Do you still play guitar? Oh, no, no. Work takes up all my time now. Yeah, I sure was a clown back then. Hmph! Strumming folk songs... Writing poetry. Can you believe it? Ah! Look at us! Hey! To Dani... Mm! So... what do you do? I'm in home mortgage compliance. Oh, so you give home loans? Oh. No, no, no, no. No. I take back houses when people don't pay. Oh. Hey, what about you? You have some sort of a... Thrift store or something? Well, it's a-- -Oh. And Dani? -Mm-hmm? I gotta tell you. You look great. Thank you. Chris. Hmm? Is that a wedding ring? Uh... Is that a problem? Dani? How's it going? Jenn, I'm in the restroom. I'm hiding. Oh, it can't be that bad. It's worse. He... has completely changed. He kicks old ladies out of their homes. He ordered me Merlot. You hate Merlot! I know. I know. Jenn, he's married. What? Any there any windows in that bathroom? Nope. Okay, take a deep breath. This is what you're gonna do. Oh. Excuse me. -Danielle? -Yes? It's me! Lawrence Conrad. Um... It's Larry. Larry? Larry! Wow! Well, you've changed. I-I hope so! I was such a nerd, completely uncool. Oh, I always thought you were okay. But I do like your new look. It kinda evolved. I have a natural fiber clothing line, everything organic cotton. Wow. What are you doing here? Class reunion. I'm not going to it, but there's a smaller get-together for some of the outsiders. Sounded like fun. I'm actually going to that. Cool. Well, I would love to catch up. Lovely. I'll see you there. "Larry." Aw, hey! There she is. Thought I was gonna have to look for another date. Listen, Chris, something has come up and I have to go. This is for the Merlot, so... Goodbye. She was taking a bath, her hair dryer was plugged in, and, somehow, it fell into the tub. Frank. Do you buy that? As of now, the evidence points to an accidental death. Roommate comes home, the electricity was off... Where is Sanders? Well, we're checking into it. Look, Jenn, um... The roommate, Megan, she found the body. She's pretty shaken up. I need to get her away from here, just for awhile. I'll put some tea on. Okay. Thanks. Here we go. This is my friend Dani's favorite. It's a little peach and ginger, some honey. It's supposed to be soothing. Mm. It's good. I don't understand how this happened. That was my hair dryer. Emma doesn't use a hair dryer. She towel-dries. When did you use it last? Last night, but I unplugged it. I know it. Did you tell detective Lynwood that? Yes. Jenn, she was really scared of Sanders. You don't think that he could've... Could he? I don't know, but the police are looking closely at him. This is crazy. I don't understand any of this. If only Jeremy had been there tonight. Was Jeremy usually there? He has been, lately. She felt safer with him after the murder. But then he started talking about getting married, and... And she didn't want to? I don't think she wanted to be with anybody. She was so pretty. Guys always wanted to go out with her. Even professor McNary tried to go out with her. Was she dating professor McNary? No, no. No. She had no interest. But he did. It's a tough line to walk when the guy's your dissertation advisor. And he was married. He's such a creep. How come Jeremy wasn't there tonight? They broke up again. I knew it was just a matter of time. And you talked to her earlier tonight? I did. And everything was okay. Frank. Hey. Hi, Megan. I wanted to come by make sure that everything's okay. Yeah, I'll be fine. Was this really just an accident? Appears to be. We didn't find any evidence to suggest otherwise. I'll be at my folks' place. I don't want to go back to the house, not for a while. After everything is processed, it'll be secured. You can go back anytime you feel comfortable. Maybe... never. Thank you for the tea and the shoulder. Of course. Are you okay to let yourself out? Yeah. I'll be fine. Thank you. Thank you. You bet. Frank... You know what I'm thinking? Yes. But don't. Not yet. Let the facts speak for themselves, and right now, on the surface, it's an accident. Has Jeremy been notified? The boyfriend? Yeah, he showed up. I guess they broke up or something. He feels he's at fault, thinks he should have been there. And where is Sanders? Don't know. Last anyone saw him, he was in the weight room. Appeared to be angry, left in a hurry. We're looking for him. What a coincidence. Yeah. When Meg came home, she thought the electricity was off. She found Emma? Yeah. As of now, they're saying accident. Who uses the hairdryer when they're in the bathtub? Nobody. But, I guess, if had been left plugged in, and she reached for something on the counter, she could've knocked it in. I guess. So sad. I thought it was an urban myth that you could die if the hair dryer fell in the bathtub. I looked it up. It still happens. Newer hair dryers are safer, and newer outlets have breakers, but it appears Emma's didn't. You're not buying this "accident" story, are you? No. And the police have an all-out search for Sanders. Frank said they had an officer at his house all night. He never came home. Hmm. You know what? Enough of this. Cheer me up. Tell me about Larry. You guys went to the smaller reunion? I had such a good time. Everyone there was someone I wanted to see, and Larry... Yes? Well, I don't want to jinx it, but he's very... awakened. Well, what does that mean? He's attuned. Spiritually open. Oh. Oh! It's from Larry. "I had a great time. How about dinner on Friday?" That's nice. I could play hard-to-get... But I'm not going to. Buy you some fries? I'm just kidding. Can I join? Sure. I just wanted to say I think you're amazing. I got a call from my old high school counselor. I probably shouldn't have pried like that. No! No, it's okay! I felt like such a fraud. I just can't believe you didn't use my past to sink my campaign. People like you, Tootie. It wasn't just the fries. Well, they didn't hurt. So... I've decided to step down and let you be class president. That's really selfless, Tootie, but, no. They voted for you. I admire what you've accomplished. No one's ever going to know. Really? Really. Hug? Yeah. Oh! And I loved your idea to put healthy veggies in the school restaurant. Would you head a committee and make that happen? Of course. Hey, Tucker. What's going on? I've found out something. Can you come over? What is it? I... I need to tell you in person. Okay, I'm on my way. Enjoy! Dani. Where's Jenn? Ah, she called. She said something came up, she's gone to his house. Bill? Tucker? Hello? Hello? Hello? Yeah. Tucker! Oh. Just go, please. I'm calling 9-1-1. No. Just go. He's gonna come back. It's nice of you to come. Jeremy? Lose the phone. You have to let me call 9-1-1. Maybe. After you tell me what happened. Tell you what? That you set Sanders up? You sent the t-shirt? I get it now. You were in love with Emma, but she didn't love you back. She did. No, she didn't. She broke up with you. And you thought that she had something going on with McNary. So you followed them one night, because you... You thought they were having some kind of a romantic getaway, but they came here. It didn't make any sense. Why would they come here? Break into a house? They were in the house to steal the suit of armor. Emma clearly under the professor's coercion. But they didn't see you come in. You confronted McNary. You slugged him in the jaw, and then you picked up the mace. He grabbed the sword off the wall to defend himself. No... He came at me with the sword. I didn't mean to kill him. It was self-defense. But who would believe it? No one. Emma was an accessory. We both would've gone down, and we panicked. That's always a problem when you kill someone-- what do you do with the body? We just wanted to buy some time. So, you put him in the suit of armor, put him back in the corner, placed the sword back on the wall... Careful not to leave any fingerprints. But you put it back wrong. I knew somebody had moved the sword. Good. You made it. Hang in there, buddy. This won't be long. That's a big sword. You sure you can handle it? Oh, I think I can handle it. Good! I like a fair fight. You think I'm gonna fight you? No. No, I'm just gonna kill you. Jeremy. -Think this through. -I have. The only people that know what happened are right here. I kill you, I have a chance. It'll look like you two got into it, Jenn somehow got in the middle. No one will know. Lives or dies? Well, Tim Sanders was cleared. I talked to him tonight. He was relieved. His pro prospects are still intact. That's good. But, Jenn, you were in the middle of a sword fight? Really? I was-- I was, uh, you know, kinda off to one side. And you almost figured it out. Except prof McNary wasn't coercing Sanders, he was coercing Emma. He held her academic future in his hands. So she agreed to help rob a house? And, in return, he would guarantee her dissertation. But then Jeremy shows up and McNary winds up dead. And because the murder happened during the commission of a crime, Emma ends up guilty as well. So, she ends up back with Jeremy, whether she likes it or not. Only when Emma thought that Sanders was gonna take the fall, she broke up with Jeremy. And if he can't have her, no one will. So, the hair dryer in the bathtub was no accident. No. I think it's time you officially retire. Honey, I'm not looking for mysteries, they come to me. Mom! I don't even want to think about your other close calls. Well, I promise to be more careful, and I won't put myself in harm's way next time. Maybe... there won't be a next time? Maybe just a... You know, a small, little, not-too-dangerous mystery? We'll talk about that.
