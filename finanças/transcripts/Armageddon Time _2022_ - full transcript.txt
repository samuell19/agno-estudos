You can borrow 'em if you want. - (school bell ringing) - (students clamoring outside) PAUL: I really like your stickers. JOHNNY: Thanks. Can I see? I got to be careful with them. I don't want Turkey to take them, - like he took your drawing. - I know. But my mother, she's president of the PTA. She could get him in a lot of trouble. Oh, that I want to see. Turkey shitting himself would be excellent. Yeah. You going on the school trip? I don't know. It's expensive. I could probably get the money for you. My family's, like, super rich.

I brought them back from Czechoslovakia. GRANDMA: Congratulations. You were in Czechoslovakia, Aunt Ruth? Yes. I worked for the Pentagon right after the war. I was relocating displaced persons in Prague. TED: That's so cool. Your great-aunt is a very impressive person. I went into this thrift store there, and I saw all these kiddush cups. Then I looked at the bottom of the cups, - and I saw all these names. - Wow.

And we can't have dumplings every night, because then we'd never have a single dollar for anything else. - IRVING: Eat it. - You know what I teach, buddy? I teach home economics. All right? You know what that means? It means I teach how to stay on a budget. - All right? - IRVING: What did I say? - ESTHER: He has no idea. - IRVING: Eat it. ESTHER: He has no idea the meaning of a dollar.

Today, when you said the spaghetti was bloody worms, - what did you mean? - Oh, that. Well, my mother, you know, when we came over here, uh, to America, through Ellis Island, uh, they served spaghetti there on Ellis Island. And my mother thought it was, uh, worms. She said, "Ach, they just... worms, bloody worms." So she wouldn't have it in the house. Yeah, I could see that. But then why'd she come here? 'Cause they wanted to kill her. That's why. Who would? Uh... she was born and raised in a small town called Ostropil in, uh, the Ukraine. And her parents had a store there in the main street. It was a shop, and, uh... But there were troops of soldiers in the garrison who were drunk and Cossacks who were crazy, always were. And sometimes they'd go out looking for Jews. They'd say, "We're looking for the Jews." And one night, they rode into the town, and, um, they broke into her parents' store, and, uh, they stabbed both of them for no reason. They stabbed both of them to death right there in front of my mama, and, uh... (scoffs) She was a young girl. She was 15, 16. She told me she had nightmares about it as long as she lived. She said you should never, ever forget the past because you never know when they may come looking for you. And she... she was right. Yeah. But she survived. She got away. She got out. She left her country. She left the Ukraine, and she was unstoppable. She got through Poland and Denmark, I think, and then to Liverpool. (chuckles) That's where The Beatles are from. The Beatles. Anyway, she met, uh, my father then, and they got married and they had me, and, uh... So she said, "Okay, come on, let's go." And we got on the boat and we came over here to America.
