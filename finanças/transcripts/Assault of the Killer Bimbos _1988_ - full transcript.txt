Put it back on, sweetheart. - [Voiceover] Get off the stage! - Shut up, you low lives. - What the heck do you think you're doing? This ain't no lousy strip joint. You're trying to get me shut down, or what? - I'm sorry. I'm trying. - Get the hell out of my club. You are fired. Bimbo! - What did you call her? - What? - [Peaches] I said, what did you call her. - Stay out of this, Peaches. I do not need any lip from you. - You called her a bimbo, didn't you? Didn't I tell you never to use that word around me? Didn't you know that's the most goddamned degrading thing you can call a woman? I mean, who the hell do you think you are, you stupid prick? (hits bar) - Party time. - Come on, Big Vinnie, what are you waiting for? Get it over with. - Look, let's get this straight, Poodles, once and for all, I'm the one who says when it's time.

You can't fire us, 'cause we quit! - We do? - We quit. - What are you looking at? Go get the car and bring it around back. - Just don't screw it up, big shot. - I'm so humiliated. I wish I was dead. - Oh honey, listen, don't you dare let that guy get to you. Everyone is entitled to a bad night every now and then. - I'm never gonna make it as a dancer. I'm too stupid. I should have gone to college. - Listen, you stop talking like that. You have got a lot of enthusiasm. You're just lacking experience, that's your problem. - Really? - Yeah, really. Are you kidding me? Do you know how many dives are gonna be dying to hire us when they find out we're out of these lousy contracts? - Bubbles, Shifty Joe here. How you doin', doll? Uh listen, babe, tonight is your lucky night. I cleared a spot for you on the schedule. Hey, who the fuck are you? Get out of my office! - I'm gonna make this short and sweet. I gotta message from Dirty Louie. (gun fires) (Vinnie laughs) - [Lulu] What was that noise? (women scream) - Here, hold this. It's your tip, sweetheart. - What the fuck? - Oh my God! They've offed Shifty Joe! - I'm gonna call the cops, and then we're gonna ruin that pretty face. - I didn't do nothin'. I was just holdin' it for him. - Alright, hold it, I mean it. Nobody move. Just take it nice and easy. Come on Lulu, let's get out of here. Come on. - What did you go and do that for, Peaches? We didn't do nothing wrong. - Oh, just shut up and get in the car! - Oh! Why don't we just call the police and tell them what happened? They'll believe us. - Cops never listen to girls like us. Trust me, I know. - Well, if we could find the guy who did it and turn him in, then they'd believe us, right? - Lulu, you're dreaming. That guy's probably in another country by now. - Want to go to my place? I have some ice cream in the fridge. - No, listen, forget your place. Your place is gonna be crawling with cops. Now, just chill out a minute, okay. I have to get my head together. Okay, Lulu. This is your last chance to bail. - Bail, what do you mean? You think they'll let us out on bail? - I'm headed for Mexico. It's the only chance I've got. The Heat's getting way too close for comfort. - What are you talking about, Peaches. You're beginning to sound like Humphrey Bogart or something. - No, Lulu, you don't understand. I'm a wanted woman. I'm a fugitive, I'm on the lam. - Oh my God. What did you do? No, no, don't tell me. I don't want to know. - A really long time ago, I used to be really hot stuff on Broadway. - Really? - Yeah, really. Yeah, musical comedy was my forte. - Wow! - Except for, there was this producer, Benny Smegman, what a low life, he offered me this really big part. And, it was a real star vehicle, except, the only problem was, in order for me to get that part, I had to, oh you know. I had to show him a good time. - Oh. Oh, oh what a bummer. - Yeah, so I said what the hell. I mean, I made it with guys for a lot stupider reasons than that, but this guy was a fuckin' pervert. I mean, I show up at his house. I'm in the sack, and the guy expects me to put on this Wonder Woman mask and then he tries to handcuff me to his fuckin' German Shepherd. - Oh, yuck! So what'd you do? - I fuckin' decked him, that's what I did. I gave him a black eye, a bloody nose, was a mess. And then, he accuses me of assault and battery. - Oh, wow! So then what'd you do? - Well, I skipped bail, I got the hell out of town, and then I just started over in Vegas. A new name, the whole potato. But, that's the honest truth, kid. And, if I was you, I'd bail out of this scene right now. - No way, Peaches. You're not getting rid of me that easy. You got me into this mess, so you'd better get me out of it. - Well, okay, kid. But, listen, take it easy. I'll let you come along for the ride. But, from now on, it's us against the world. Now, we're going to Mexico. - Cool. I like Mexican food. Let's go! Peaches? - Hmm? - You ever see a flying saucer? - No, I've seen a couple of flying plates in my time. - No, this is serious. UFOs, I read about 'em in the Inquirer. They always attack people on deserted roads, like this one. - Oh, get out of here. - No, really. This one lady, what was her name, oh anyway, she was travelin' all by herself, this flying saucer landed, and it made her car stop right in the middle of the road. These Martians scooped her up inside the flying saucer, and they had this machine, it took off all her clothes. Martians actually saw her naked. I mean, can you believe that? - Oh, come on, Lulu. I mean, that's a bunch of hoobie. - No, it's true. Boy, if a Martian ever saw me naked, I'd freak. (Peaches tunes radio) I'm starving. - [Voiceover] Police in Los Angeles are investigating the murder of underworld figure, Shifty Joe Malone, who was gunned down in his nightclub last night. The suspects in the case, two female go-go dancers, were last seen in a purple and black striped, skin tight party dress and a two piece light blue ruffle top and skirt. They are considered armed and dangerous. ♫ Have you heard that story ♫ Did you get the news ♫ What a hillbilly did to an old John Blue ♫ - Okay, look, hand me that bag, okay.

See, the way a girl dresses is your statement. And, if a guy can't handle it-- - How y'all doin'? Cute outfit. Coffee? - Gee, thanks. - Nice day, huh? There you are. So, what'll it be for you, gals? - Um, I don't know.

You always need the-- - Excuse me. - Hello. - I'd like to apologize for my friend, here. What's going on here? - It wasn't me. - Look at my hand. What's your excuse, huh? - Nothing, nothing. - Grab your ear. Go on, get out of here, go on. - Wow. (Peaches giggles) - Come on, dude. I was preparing to lay some pipe. - We have no time for those bitches. - Forget about that shit, man We got to get Billy Boy, here, in the water. - Jeez. They're kind of stuck up, aren't they. - God, do yourself a favor. Don't get hung up on surf bums. Trust me, I know what I'm talking about. (harmonica music) - Here y'all go.

Oh no, listen, I'm sorry if I scared you. Listen, I had the safety catch on, I swear to God. - Y'all aren't gonna kill me, are you? - Kill you, what? - Yeah, what? - There ain't nobody gonna pay my ransom. Y'all kidnapped the wrong girl. - Kidnapped? Okay, wait a minute. Let's you and I get something straight. Nobody kidnapped anybody. We rescued you from a miserable situation. And, if you're not happy about it, you're free to walk, no one's stopping you. (Darlene gasps) - I'm free to go? - Yeah, you're more than free. Look, here's cab fare home. - Right, a cab out here, right. Where am I gonna go? Fine, just hit the road. I've never been south of the border. - Are you through? - Put the pedal to the metal. (men coughing) - Dude, you guys fucking blew it, man. - I had pooter in the pop for all of us man, and you blew it. - What, are you happy. - Dude, we got one day of scorn, maybe two, depending on jaw and the circumstance, and we're not even close to the border. - I know dude, here. We gotta move, man. - Lulu, check the map. I want to get us off this main road, and let the Heat pass by. - I'm not really good with maps, Peaches, I always get lost. - Oh here, give me that thing. I'll give you a hand. Take that little road up ahead. It looks pretty good. - Yeah, that one babe was calm as it gets, man. - Yeah, she was. Hey dude, what's the scoop? - Gotta scrape, you gotta get? - No. - Oh yeah. - I don't know, man. I thought the one who hostage drive was kind of skexy, myself. - What's skexy, man. - Kind of skanky, kind of sexy. - No, man, I'm not talking about the hostage, man, and definitely not that Bournefield bitch, the other one. - Man, you liked her, she was kind of-- - Yeah, I did, man. So what? - Dude, you loved her. - I didn't love her, dude. - Yes. you did. - No, I didn't. - That's why you bagged the farm boy. You know, I'm kind of into the hostage situation, myself. - You liked that. Where are we? - Jesus Christ, it is hotter than hell out here. - Listen, Lulu, take the wheel. - Huh? - Take the wheel. Oh, there, much better. Now I can work on my tan. - What kind of dancers you all say you were, again? Go-go dancers, out of LA. - Go-go dancers? Ain't that just a wee bit passé? - Darlene, the go-go happens to be a highly respected classical art form. It is interpretive dance in a rock and roll format. - And bikinis. - Come on, man, pass me your paper. (men fight) Here we go, let's gun 'em. Dude, you're freaking-- - Oh, fuck!

I feel like such a hick in this waitress uniform. - Sure thing, Darlene, help yourself. - Uh-oh! Someone's after us! Is it the cops? - They're right on our tail. - Are you sure it's the cops? - Well, I'm not gonna take any chances. - Step on it, Peaches. - Oh God, we're gonna get caught for sure. - It's the surfers, oh boy. - Oh, great. - Wow, what a totally cool car. - Jesus, those surfers scared the shit out of me. - Doggone it! - What, are you okay? - I broke a doggone nail. - Oh, look in my purse.

Superglue. - Well, darlin', a girl's got to be prepared for a night on the town or a weekend in Hawaii. - There we are, good as new. (surfer boys converse) - I think we're out of gas. Yeah dude, we gotta put it in the tank. - Hold on. - Whoa, man. - Dude, man, I nearly fucking killed us. - Where are we, man?

(police sirens) - Alright, out of the car. - Okay, you're under arrest. - I say that, Walter. - Oh sorry, Sheriff. - Alright ladies, nice and easy. - [Walter] Yeah, yeah. - Come on. - Okay, officers, listen, what would it take for you to let this whole thing slide. - You put your hands on the car and spread 'em. - Ooo! - Well, what are you waiting for. Aren't you gonna read us our rights? - [Sheriff] What do you think, Walter? We ought a frisk our prisoners, don't you think? - [Walter] Yes, sir. - [Sheriff] No telling what they got under those fancy dresses. - Oh boy, yes sir. - What do you mean on you, you! - Oh jeez. (police siren) (Darlene yells) - You didn't have to hit him. Assaulting a police man leads to electrocute for sure. - Shut up, Lulu. - Hello, this is ah-ah-ah-- - Walter, let me have that. This is car 19er, in hot pursuit of the Killer Bimbos. Put it away, Walter. - Aye, Sheriff. - Give me a break Lulu, I'm going full throttle. (women scream) - [Lulu] Here they come, Peaches! - [Peaches] Oh my God! - Alright, you bimbos, pull over. - Try and make me pull over! Jesus Christ, what does that sheriff have under that hood? - Yo, man. Check it out, man. - [Surfers] Whoa! - Dude, it's those chicks, and they're in trouble. - Oh, fuckin' fuck. - Look. - No, no way man. - Dude! You'd be swerve dude. - You can't define me man, you can't define me man. - Double o seven on the cop block. - Take the old Mill Road and cut 'em off. - Jesus guys, I can't believe those surf bums helped us out. - I told you that Wayne is the coolest. - Oh, you all need to have your heads examined. - [Lulu] No, he's so cute. - [Peaches] Lulu, give me a break. - You know somethin'-- Oh my God, the cops are onto us again. - Hey, what the hell are you doing? Hey, that's my French lingerie. - What the? - I can't see anything, Sheriff. - They're tryin' to kill us, Walter. - Cut it out! - Here, let me help you. - Walter! Get your head out the window. (women cheer) - [Sheriff] Walter. - [Walter] What Sheriff? - [Sheriff] Get off me. - Would you give me that thing, Darlene. We must have taken a wrong turn somewhere. - Oh, we're not lost, are we you guys. I mean, we're not gonna die in the middle of the desert, are we? - No, no, no, no. Looky here. Now, you see this mark, right here. That's the Mexican border. And, it's ten miles that way. - [Peaches And Lulu] Are you sure? - When it comes to maps, I know what I'm talking about. - [Voiceover] This is Gimmick's Radio from beautiful downtown Jalapeño. We welcome to Mexico, gente. - [Lulu] Talk to him Peaches, tell him to let us in, okay. - Yeah, I used to know a little bit of Spanish. Hi, buenos díos muchacho. Oh God, he's not exactly being sociable is he? - Flirt with him, sugar. That'll get you what you're looking for. - Why's he looking at us like that? - Umm, everything's cool, right officer? Um, (speaks in Spanish) Oh no. Oh! (women cheer) Muchas gracias, señor. Have a nice day. - [Lulu] Oh, we're finally here. - [Peaches] Welcome to Jalapeño, Mexico. - [Lulu] You're right. - [Darlene] Oh, the men look right. Check out those guys. - [Peaches] Girls, we are not here to check out the local scenery, we are here to hide out. - [Lulu] Oh yeah. - Oh my God. What a dive. This isn't exactly what I was expecting. - Exactly where did you hear about this place, again? - Oh, a couple of tough guys I used to hang out with in Brooklyn, used to come here when they were hiding from the cops. It's the kind of place where they don't ask any questions and they keep their mouths shut. - Uh huh, yeah. A no-tel motel. - Oh look, I feel bad. It's a dump. Maybe we should go see what else is cut right, Tijuana has to offer. - No, come on, Peaches, I mean we've been driving around forever. And, there's no place else for miles around. I mean, this place looks good enough to me. Don't you think so, Darlene? - Oh hey, I stayed in a lot worse, that's for sure. - Yeah, and they even have a swimming pool and everything. Come on, Peaches. Please. - Man oh man, what a couple of cheap dates. (buzzer rings) - Buenos días, señoritas. Hernandez at your service. - How you doin'?

It's a party, remember. - Hernandez has the finest margaritas in all the world. - Oh, we know man! And, it's the cheapest stuff in town. - We love it, hey! - Hey, come over later, we'll pluff. - It's the wanted ones. - Hi, fellas. - What's happening? - I can't believe you're here.

Here, there you go, get out of here. Siesta! Siesta! See you later. - Your Greyhounds are ready. - Oh yeah yeah, good boy good boy. - Gracias Señor Vinnie, so humble sir. - Yeah right, get out here. - Oh man, oh man this is our chance to get this whole mess straightened out. - Thanks babe, baby when are we gonna blow this joint? When you said Mexico, I thought you meant Acapulco or something. Is this the whole enchilada? - Oh Poodles, doll face, I told you, as soon as Dirty Louie calls me and tells me it's cool, we are out of here baby. I mean, first class all the way. - I'm bored. - Oh yeah, well Big Vinnie has something that will entertain you. - Yeah, what's that? (Poodles screams) - Come on, come on. Let's go upstairs. - You're such a beast. - Yeah, well they don't call me Big Vinnie for nothing. - See, the problem is, is that if he sees Lulu or I, then that's it, the show's over. That's why it's gotta be you, Darlene. - Me! Why do you figure that one. - Well, Lulu, are you paying attention to any of this? - Huh? - Jesus you guys, you know this is very serious business here. - You know what he said to me? - Who? - Wayne-o. He said, "A good looking babe like me," "Doesn't need to wear any makeup." - What? - What kind of smart alec remark is that? Good lookin' babes don't need makeup. - Good looking babes don't need to wear makeup. I don't know. What do you suppose he meant by that? (knocking at door) - Who the hell do you think that is? Yeah, what do you want? - I am Juan. Here to satisfy your every desire. - [Peaches] Oh, room service. - Sí sí. - Oh great. Where's the food? - What food? I'm Juan, the great slobbering ghoul. - Oh my God, you guys, I think we ordered a room service gigolo. - What do we do now? - Listen, you know what? All of us three girls have a headache, isn't that something. So, I'm real sorry for the inconvenience, thanks a whole lot anyway. - No problema. If you change your mind, you call 976-Juan. - Great! Will do. Okay, you guys, first thing in the morning we're getting a Spanish dictionary. Alright, now back to business. Tonight at the bar, is our chance to get that hit man that framed us. Darlene, this is what you gotta do. (knocks on door) - [Darlene] Peaches, no way. I am not gonna go out there with that killer. - Oh shit, check it out. Look at that cowgirl move. - What, what? Hey, hey, Hernandez, Andre, Andre. (speaks in Spanish) And, a drink for the lady. - Señorita, compliments of señorini. - Just a coke, thanks. - Oh, on second thought, make it a nice cold margarita. - Ah, bueno. (speaks in Spanish) Jose Cuervo, is a very good friend of mine. - Oh, Darlene, not on an empty stomach. - [Poodles] Adios amigo. There's other bars in this town. - Oh brother, Darlene, don't get carried away. - Big Vinnie, I'm starvin'. I want jumbo shrimp, at that fancy place on the beach. - I cannot believe that I'm doing this. I should have known the minute I laid eyes on you that you were nothing, nothing but trouble. - Would you girls calm down. This is gonna be a piece of cake. - Oh, come on, that's easy for you to say. It's not your piece of cake that's on the taco line. - You're not gonna kill him, are you Peaches? - Hell yes, she's gonna kill him if she has to, right? - You guys! - Right? - We've been out of bullets since San Berdu. - Oh no! (knocking at door) - Now, y'all ain't gonna wait too long before coming out of there, right? - Oh no, don't worry. We're gonna be right on top of it. - Hey doll. It's me, Big Vinnie. Aren't you gonna invite me in? - Yeah, sure, come on in, sugar. I was beginning to think you weren't gonna make it. - Are you kidding me, babe. Wild bushes couldn't get me away. You know, it just takes a shit pot full of booze to put Poodles out. Son of a bitch. To the sexiest broad in the world. I think this is gonna be the beginning of something big. - Oh, keep it in your pants, Jack. - Well, let's get cooking babe. I ain't got a lot of time, alright. - What kind of a dick hip picks a little piece on a first date? - What's the matter? Scared of guns, baby huh? - Only when they're in the wrong hands. - That's a good one. I gotta remember that one. - Where you goin', sugar? - I'm just hangin' up my treads. You know, this bucket problem and wrinkles like the sun. - Oh, let me get that for you. Oh, this is a nice warm coat. - Oh baby, I am fuckin' ready for this. - The gun, get the gun. - You know, I could hear your heart beat all the way over here, you know. - Oh, that's not my heart, sugar, that's my knees knocking. - Oh, I must be dreamin'. What the fuck are you doin', huh? - Can we put this away? I'm really scared of guns, they make me nervous. See, my daddy saw it, he shot himself in the left foot when he was deer hunting once. - You are too much, you know that. I can't say no to you. - Okay, kiddo, we're on. - Yeah! - The fuck, there's no doorknob. We're stuck. Oh, come on, open up you stupid door. - Come on, baby. It's lonely down here. - Just a second, sugar. This polyester wrinkles like a son of a bitch, too. What are y'all waitin' for? Get your asses out here. - What the? Hey, I know you. You're the bimbos from the go-go. - That's right fucker, the ones you tried to pin a rap on. - Hey, hey, hey easy. - Where's my boyfriend? - Poodles! - You lousy little. - Hit her, darling, hit her. - Nobody takes my man. You asked for it. - Poodles. - Shut up. - She's gonna kill her. - Get her, Peaches. - Alright, everybody freeze. Okay, now all you bimbos, hands up. - Big Vinnie, baby, I could give you a k? - Later. Alright, all you bimbos, on the bed. Come on, move. So, you thought you were gonna pull one over on Big Vinnie, huh? Huh? - You bimbs, don't know who you're dealing with. - Shut up. You know, doll, it's really a shame. We could have made beautiful music together. - Oh please, just kill us you big ape, don't make us puke. - Oh, don't rush me. Don't rush me. I want to savor the moment. You see, I ain't never offed no broads before. And you, yeah, you, you are truly the worst fuckin' dancer I ever saw in my life. You know, coggin' you will be like my significant contribution to mankind. (Lulu cries) - Hey girls, party-- Who the fuck are you? - No, you got it backwards punk, who the fuck are you? - We're nobody, man. - Dude, wrong room. - Ahh, my eyes. My eyes, ahh. - Alright, girls. Later. Maybe we'll catch you next time. - Let me go, let me go. You're gonna regret this you bimbos. - Get out of here, bully. - Police, freeze. - Officer Arbury. - Everybody, reach for the sky. It's okay, Darlene, you're safe now. - Oh boy, am I ever glad to see you. - I told you I'd save you, Darlene. I always keep my word. - Excuse me, cowboy, but we saved ourselves. Thank you very much. - You two are in a shit load of trouble. Let's go. - Us two? This is the guy that you want. - Really, Arnie, they got it all wrong back in the states. That guy's the go-go killers. - What's going on here? - Sugar, it's a long story. - It all started on Broadway, a long time ago, there was this producer named Benny Smegman, I used to be this really great dancer on Broadway. And, he offered me this part, and so that's it officer. We never meant to hurt anybody, but we don't want to take a murder rap for some scumbag. - And, that's the honest to God truth, you honor. Cross my heart and hope to die. - That's right, I believe 'em. And, you should too. - Alright, tell you what I'm gonna do. I don't have any authority down here, anyways. So, I'll haul these two in for now, and sort through the rest of this mess later. - Hooray! - Alright, you two, let's go. Come on, Darlene. I'll take you home. - That's okay, Arnie. I think I'm just gonna hang around for a while. With my girlfriends. - Are you sure? Okay, if that's how you want it. I'll be around when you change your mind. See you, Darlene. Move it, you two. Come on, let's go. - Wow, what a trip. - Oh my goodness, he forgot his coat. (Peaches gasps) - Oh my! Holy cow! What a wad! This must be the money he got for offing Shifty Joe. - You're not thinking what I think you're thinking? - We're gonna give it back, aren't we? - Oh, fuck no. Are you kidding. That guy owes us. This little wad here, is gonna bankroll us a vacation like you two have never seen before. Yeah! - Jeez you guys, everything's sure turned out great, didn't it? - Boy, I'll sure say, you girls are more fun than a rodeo. I say we hit every beach between here and the South Pole. - Yeah, I mean, we really might have a future with this beach bunny routine. - It's the sand bunnies, guys. - Hey honey, did you like my jams? - Hey babe, pass me another Kona out of the cooler. - [Bimbos] Rad surfing, dudes. - [All] Cowabunga! ♫ Cowabunga ♫ Say girls ♫ Yeah ♫ Let's say we have some fun ♫ Hey girls ♫ Uh-huh ♫ Want to find me a real beach bum ♫ And, girls ♫ Now what ♫ You bring your comb and hairspray ♫ 'Cause girls every lovin' day is a go-go day ♫ Don't call me bimbo ♫ Oh no ♫ I don't call me bimbo ♫ Oh no ♫ Please don't call me bimbo ♫ Oh no, no, no, no ♫ Some guy once said that to me ♫ Now, that guy's history ♫ Girls ♫ Mm-hmm ♫ You know I got things on my mind ♫ World affairs ♫ Oh yeah ♫ The bum, the state of mankind ♫ Girls ♫ What now ♫ I'm thinkin' it will be okay ♫ As long as I get to go-go dance ♫ Every single day ♫ Cowabunga ♫ Don't call me bimbo ♫ Oh no ♫ Honey, don't call me bimbo ♫ Oh no ♫ Please don't call me bimbo ♫ Oh no, no, no, no ♫ Some guy once said that to me ♫ Now, that guy's history ♫ - [Voiceover] Police in Los Angeles are investigating the murder of underworld figure, Shifty Joe Malone.
