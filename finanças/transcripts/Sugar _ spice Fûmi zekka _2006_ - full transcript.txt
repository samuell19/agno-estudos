When Grandma invited us out for a drive, Noriko was the first to accept. They had become... Here, "Nori". Thanks, "Fuji". ... fast friends. - Yum! - See? It wasn't bad, though. The sudden outing... wasn't bad, either. I didn't mind if we... drove till dawn. Those were my feelings but... I didn't think we'd actually do it. Grandma? Come on. You okay? My grandma... had come to find... the scene in that photograph. The very spot her former lover had stood. She'd come to see... with her own eyes... what he had seen. But... it was wrong. This looked like the place. But it wasn't. The photo had been taken... somewhere else. Neither of us... dared... tell her. With a little more planning and research... the right spot would've been simple enough to find. This wasn't it. But we couldn't laugh about it. Let's go. Wake up, sleepyheads! We're going. Back to Tokyo. Non stop. From that moment, Noriko and I... were nearly inseparable. It was plainly obvious... that I'd found a girlfriend. Someone to fuss over. Someone always... on my mind. Nothing could beat seeing her smile. It was... perfection. Pretty soon... she was everything to me. Shiro? On your 19th birthday... I'll leave the dormitory. Can I live with you? Deal? Thank you. You gave him Shiro's address? They're friends, right? He's Noriko's ex. "Ex" what? You're slow. Ex-beau. "Ex-beau"? What's a "beau"? Here you are. Wait. Nori. Open up. Come on. Please. You living with him? I plan to. With a gas stand attendant? He's sweet. He doesn't come barging in on people, uninvited. He's not you. Hey, Gill. What's up? Won't work. What? This. Why? Because... Don't touch that! This doesn't suit you. Don't touch that! You need me! You need me. Let's start over. I need you, too. I promise... I won't hurt you again. I won't betray you. Give me another chance. You can't be serious. It's impossible. It's too late. Too late. You took too long. Why come now? Shiro! I can't face Naoki but... I came to apologize to you. For getting you involved. That's all I wanted to say. Naoki said... he'd kill you to get her back. I told him he was crazy. But... I think I finally understand... his feelings... I do now. I understand. Shiro... you're in love? I'm talking about Naoki. How much he loved her. So... I know. Believe me. That's why I won't give her up. I'll love her even more. Take care. You, too. Hi. Hi. Where'd you go? Not telling. Shopping? Not telling. What did you buy? Not telling, either. Go change. What're you making? I said I'm not telling. Need some help? Raining again? I'm so sorry. Why, are you making it rain? Nope, can't be helped. Noriko's taking a leave of absence. Exams. Don't apologize. You're a student. It's tough. I remember. Grandma holds an annual event. A Christmas party. Come. It'll be fun. "In honor of your 70th birthday" "And a life lived in good health" Congratulations. And now! For a commemorative photo! What is that? How about some tofu stew? I'd love some. Cooked slowly with tender loving care. Like Shiro. Well, he's grandson after all. His goodness runs real deep. He's steeped in it. Relationships that are allowed to mature over time and effort... can be the best kind. You've been a stranger. Grandma? I need to apologize. About what? That photo. The one your ex-boyfriend took. It's Lake Yamanaka. At dusk, not dawn. I know because... I've been there. I heard if you succeed in seeing "Diamond Fuji"... your wish will come true. So I went. That was a day... I've been trying to forget. Truth is... I still remember. Silly me. Lake Yamanaka, huh? I'm sorry. Must've been painful. All this time. I'm angry at myself for not being able to forget. And ashamed. But I'll try... by Christmas. You're having a party, right? Come. Of course. Just be yourself. Don't hold it in. Cry if you'd like. It'll be just between you and me. Girl talk. When something fragile... seems about to break... What choice do I have but to treat it gently. All I could do... was to keep believing. To believe... in her. I believed... in her. I believed. We're all here. So eat, drink and be merry! Ready! If you sample food and it doesn't taste right, you put it back. If you try on clothes and they don't fit right... you put it back. But... when you buy on impulse... you can always return it if you have the receipt. What's your point? Shiro? You've been returned. Stop waiting around. I'm not waiting. Noriko was... always a "drifter". I don't even want to see her face. Good for you. It's about time you felt that. You're one to talk. Who's the one who can't stop waiting around? Taking down a photo you pretend not to care about. Then putting it back. It's pitiful... embarrassing. Pathetic! No, you're pathetic. And childish. You don't... understand a thing. And so... it ended. Christmas... had ended. She quit today. She just left. Shiro! She can't be far. Go. You're cool. Ouch. You're lame. He ran over me. Shiro... Merry Christmas. I know you won't believe me... but ourtime together... meant so much to me. You were wonderful. Thank you... for such kindness. Thank you. We had a deal, didn't we? I'm sorry. Can I live with you? Deal? Forgive me. Goodbye. Listen. Just remember this. For when you truly fall in love. Remember what little girls are made of. "Softies" get dumped. Got that, "idiot." "Idiot"? Numbskull. A man's got to know when to be gentle, and when to get tough. Suck on this and ponder. Sugar gives your brain its nutrients, you know. That's when I noticed something forthe first time. Written on the box of caramels my grandma had... in old-fashioned type... "Rich in Nutrients" "Sublime in Flavor" A good description. Finished my rounds. Good work. Let me introduce you to... our new recruit. You're lucky to be young. And free of problems. All my friends from school are balding now. Truth is, I've still got plenty of problems. For example... How are you, Son? Found a good cram school for you. My folks haven't yet given up... on my going to college. My 70-year-old grandmother... grows younger each day. Something I must learn to live with. Check under the hood. But the burning issue for me is learning... when to be tough... and when to be soft. I still don't understand. Welcome! Oh, hello. Do I make a life of... sweat and grease... my career? It's a question... I can't yet answer. But I have to admit... I like where I am. Someday, I will again... fall in love. Truly... in love. Excuse me. Oh, thank you. Pardon me. Pretty soon... I'll be 19.
