Shit. Shit. I'm disappointed in you, Dean. And after everything we've been through today. I'm sorry. It's too late to apologise. Look. I've got money if you want it. I have money. Why the fuck are you doing this? If you really need to ask why, then you haven't learned anything today have you? 11 seconds. Not bad. ASSAILANT Do you see that. He can't even get through a session with a marriage counsellor without checking that thing. How are we ever supposed to fix this? Jason? What can I see. She is so paranoid about my work that well, she already think I'm more interested in that than I am in her. And are you? Am I what? More interested in your work than you are in Zoe. Okay. The fact you eve have to think about it tells me that I'm right. And I swear to God, if you call me paranoid one more time, I will lose... You'll what? Because somebody has to pay the bills and keep the roof over our head. You don't get it Zoe. I'm at work all the time for you, not for me. No. it's you that doesn't get it. All I'm asking for is more time together. More time with you. Balancing our life and my own goals isn't exactly easy, you know. But we used to have our goals together. I just want that back. Zoe, please let's talk about this. We've been talking for an entire hour. You know what I want, so either try that or... Or what? Hold on a second, please. Look. We're damaged right now and that is all my fault. I'm gonna fix this. Let's get away. Really? Let's go back to the Caribbean. Remember after I proposed to you there we watched that couple sail by on that yacht. Yeah. We used to say that would be us in ten years. Well, let's be that couple now. Do you honestly mean this? Please Zoe, give me one more shot. Let me make this right. Okay. But on one condition. Anything. No work phone. At all. No work phone. Promise? You have my word. Hey, wait up. Wait up. You don't even know where you're going. I don't need you to tell me where we're going. Oh, come on. You're not still annoyed about the flight attendant thing, are you? You didn't have to be so stubborn about it, though, and hold up everyone getting off the plane. It was embarrassing. I said sorry. Yeah. But not to me. Why do you always have to be like that? Like what? Is that some sort of dig about our old failed business again? Because look, I screwed up, okay? Are you gonna hold it against me for the rest of our lives? You put all of our company's savings into a bad investment behind my back. I'd call that a little bit more than just screwing up. Taxi? Yeah. Alright buddy. And clearly we're in the middle of something here, okay? Sorry. My bad. See what I mean. There's no need for that. Thanks for apologising. It means so much to me. And yes, we'll take your taxi. - Thank you. - Right this way. Great start. In other news, the body of Dean, a well known British fish supplier, was discovered along the popular hiking trail. Police are appealing to any possible lead to help them identify the assailant. Up next, more hits from your favourite radio station. Great. There's a murder on the Just our luck. Unless he's got himself a boat, I think we're gonna be perfectly fine. Not if I kill you first. Hmm? Nothing. Thanks. You okay? Yeah. Just taking it all in. I've missed this. Missed what? Never mind. You get out a lot more than I do these days. There's our guy. Come on. Hi there. Welcome. You must be Jason. I am. You must be our captain. That's right. How was your flight? Oh. Not exactly smooth sailing. Oh. - Hello there. - Hi. Zoe, this is our captain for the trip. Yeah. Just call me Henry. Lovely to meet you, Henry. Henry was just saying that he lined up our permits for the island hike tomorrow. Oh, permits? Yeah. Well, it's a damn shame what happened on that island. All the tourism just damn dried up in the last couple of years, but they still wanna look after the historical sites, so anybody who goes over there, well, you need a permit. But not to worry. I got you all lined up. Makes sense. Nothing's quite what it used to be, I guess. Well you guys must love a challenge 'cause you picked one hell of a hike to start off with. Yeah. Well, we used to operate a tour guide business together. You did? How about that. What happened to it? Life. I got you. Got you. The trail is kinda special to us, though. I proposed to Zoe at the end of it about ten years ago at the hotel right on the water there. I'm sorry to say that hotel is abandoned now, but it's still a beautiful spot. Well, what do you say we get on our way? Thank you. Yeah. Oh, but the way guys, I hope you don't mind but I took the liberty of making a reservation for you at a nice restaurant a couple of islands over. Very romantic. Sounds great. Look. I'm sorry about the thing on the plane. And the thing in the taxi. Okay. But... Fresh slate, starting right now. There's still love behind that moody face of yours. I can see it. Well, stop making me moody and I'll stop giving you that face. Deal. To us. What are you up to? Just thinking. Admiring Henry's lifestyle actually. He's got it pretty good, for sure. I used to think this would be us by now. And it will be soon enough, once I put in a few more years, get a promotion. Well, the world will literally be our oyster. The world already is. I'll get us some more. You're a lucky man, Jason. Thanks. Come out here to try to remind myself of that. I thought I'd remind you, too. I know it's none of my business, but I do recognize a make or break holiday when I see one. Get a lot of them out here, do you? More than our share, I'm afraid. I've had more than my share of divorces, too. Sorry to hear that. What happened? Let's just say I learned a little too late what life is all about. How lucky I really was. You know, my advice to you? I'd have those next two glasses of champagne down in the bedroom. I'll just pop on my headphones and crank up some country music and keep my eyes on the horizon. You're a wise man, Henry. Yeah. I'm a wise man. Can you put it over there, please? Okay. Sorry. I thought I'd turned that off. Well, honestly, it's fine. Did you wanna... It's my sister. I'll give you two some privacy. You can just meet me at the bar when you're done. Okay. Hi. Everything okay? Can you just hang on one second. You're not working are you? Just 'cause you did promise you'd leave that stuff at home. Just getting my wallet. So, I'll see you in about an hour. Great. Hi. Yeah, Jason just went to the bar. Honestly? I have absolutely no idea. Hey. What can I get for you? Something strong. You pick. Hey. This isn't what I ordered. I asked for a lime and soda, not whatever the fuck this is. Okay. I'll change it. You should apologise to her. What? That was your first strike. You got two more. Apologise to her. Look man, I don't know who you think you are. Last chance. Apologise now. Okay man, sure. Whatever you say. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to speak to you like that. Good. The original drink will do just fine. Tell her now. You know what? Don't worry about changing out that drink. Fair play. That guy deserved it. I meet a lot of people like that, sadly. On vacation? Literally just started. Don't tell my wife I'm working, though? Wouldn't dream of it. Hope it's a good holiday for you and... Zoe. She's heading down here for dinner in a little while. Just getting ready now. I'm Jason, by the way. Jason Sellers. Michael. Michael? Just Michael. Okay. Michael. You remind me of someone. Oh yeah? Who's that? Not sure. So, you're not sure who I remind you of. That's a little bit weird? Sorry. It's been a rough couple of weeks. Been moving around. Got a new boat. You know what? We're actually travelling around in a yacht. You sail. No. No. Me and the wife can't sail to save our lives, but we've got a captain so it's all good on that front. Jealous. Wish I could join you. Well, you could join me for a drink right now if you want. Sure. Henry. Yeah. You know the restaurant, right? Yeah. Are you asking this old man for a little fashion advice? Pretty much. I just can't decide whether I should dress up or go casual. Let's see here. Well, I've always found that a little effort goes a long way. - Yes. - Thanks. By the way, how do I get there? Oh, don't worry about that. When you're ready to go I'll take you ashore. You can't miss it. I hope you don't mind me saying this but I agree with your friend on the phone. That was my sister and were you listening to our conversation? No, no. Calm seas carry loud voices and I do agree with her. About what? If you want these things to stand the test of time, that's exactly what you have to give them. Time. So, take a little advice from an old fool for love. You go on your hike tomorrow and well, who knows? By the time you get to the end of the trail maybe that spark is still there. Hi. We've got a table booked here tonight. What's the name? I think it's in my husband's. Jason. Oh yeah. We've added the extra place already. Extra place? Yeah. So, basically my boss is getting pushed out for sure after messing up like that and I know I'm the next in line. There is literally nobody who puts those kinda hours in at that place like me. Zoe. You made it. Sure did. Sorry. This is Michael. Michael, this is my other half. It's really nice to meet you, Zoe. You are wonderful. Thanks for saying. It's nice to meet you, too. Me and Michael were just chatting at the bar. Turns out he's sailing around the island, just like us. Well, not quite like you guys. I'm in a tiny boat on my own, so it's nowhere near as romantic. Yeah. Well, Jason is certainly full of romance, aren't you? You know what? I'm real sorry to intrude on your meal like this. I'm gonna let you two have your evening together. Oh, it's okay. Join us, please. Yeah. It'll be fun. Okay. Well that's really kind of you both. Let's get you a drink. Sounds great. Wait, Michael, where's your glass? None for me, thanks. Not much of a drinker, are you? You got me. I mean, we probably shouldn't drink much more considering the hike tomorrow. We could always just push it back. Really? What about the day permits Henry's arranged? Come on. No. You guys are gonna have a real experience tomorrow. You can't miss out on that. To new beginnings. I would choose to that. So, what is it you do again, Michael? He's a teacher. I prefer educator. What do you teach? I see myself as a life coach. Okay. But what I'm asking is what do you specifically coach people in? You know the kind of stuff. No. I don't really know what kind of stuff. I mean, I'd love to know more, though. You don't wanna talk about work tonight. We came to the Caribbean to get away from that, right Jason? Okay. I was just asking what your job was. No harm in finding out it's a bit bore. It's... Zoe. He doesn't wanna talk about it. Okay. No problem. You know, Jason, that's who it is. Who what is? Who you remind me of. It's a younger me. Is that a good thing? Not really. Well, thanks pal. I love you, too. Hey, wait a minute. Jason reminds you of you and you don't wanna talk about your job. What's your deal, Michael? Okay. That's enough. You know, I actually didn't catch your second name. Jesus Christ, Zoe. Will you stop grilling the man with all of your question? Don't talk to me like that. Well then, just leave it, okay? Apologise to Zoe now. You know what? I think we should probably go. No-one is going anywhere until he apologises to you. What did you just say to me? I'm only gonna tell you three times, Jason. That's it. This is your second time. Apologise to Zoe now. I'm sorry, but who do you think you are? I don't need you to tell me what I can and cannot let my own husband get away with. I'm only gonna tell you to stay out of this three times. That was your first time. Don't talk to my wife that way. I'll kick your ass. Please Jason, just leave it. Is that it? I don't know where you get off talking to people like that but if I was you, I would walk away while I still could. Last chance is coming up, Jason. Think about this very carefully. Alright, alright. That's enough. Break it up. Hey, he started it, man. The guys got a screw loose or something. You gotta go. This is the final time I'll ask you, apologise. You're crazy, man. Zo, wait up. No chance. I just wanna get back to the boat as quick as we can. Listen, listen, listen. It's over now, so can we just take a minute and, and breathe? Did you see what that guy did to the doorman? If you're not as scared as I am then maybe there's something wrong with your head too. Oh come on, you're just being para... Don't you dare say it. Just don't, OK? Am I really that bad that you just can't have dinner, the two of us? I'm so sorry, Zoe. I really am. Can we please just go to bed, I am done with today. Oh, shit. What? I must have left my wallet at the bar. You're joking? I'm not. But I'll just go and... No, no, you're not. We'll cancel the cards and we'll just use mine until we get home. - Zoe, that's ridiculous. - Jason, no. you're not going back there. If you do, I'm going. Going where? Home. As in home, home. OK. OK, then we'll leave it. Whatever you want. What I want is to get back on the boat. Sure. Hey, good morning sunshine. Feeling better after a little sleep? What sleep? Oh, come on now. It's gonna be a beautiful day and maybe that'll make up for everything. Maybe. Good morning, Henry. Morning, Jason. At least the weather's on our side today. Yeah. But this isn't the Caribbean. Weather tends to change minute to minute around here. But I don't think any storms are headed your way just now. Thank God for that. I think last night was about the only storm we could handle right now. Yeah, it is a scary thing, thinking someone can hurt you? But you know I think in the long run, it's all gonna work out. I hope so, She still cares enough about you that she doesn't wanna see you get hurt. We should be there in about 30 minutes or so, are you all packed? Zo? I think that boat is following us. Wait, you don't think it's... Could be. I highly doubt it. What if it's him? It's a fisherman, Zo. You never take me seriously. Yes I do. I just don't think someone would follow us out here because of a stupid bar fight. I don't care what you think. That guy scared the life out of me last night. Look. I'll prove it to you. Hey, Henry. Yeah? You ever seen that boat before? Oh yeah, that's Dean Levin, local fisherman. Bit of a pain in the ass, but harmless, why? No reason. See? Nothing to worry about. Woo. Alrighty, you got those permits? Yep. I guess there's not much I can tell you about that trail you don't already know. No, sir, we probably know that trail better than you. I bet you do. Alright, I'll take the boat the other side of the island, I'll meet you over there. Alright. Zoe. Thanks, Henry. Enjoy your day. You're welcome and I will. I'm gonna go back there, crank up some rock and roll music, pop a couple of beers and have a good old time. I'll see you later. You're not still worried about that boat, are you? Amongst other things. - Do you wanna enlighten me? - Not really. So, we're just gonna do the whole trail like this then, are we? Because it was supposed to be romantic. Yeah, so was dinner last night. - Fair enough, Zo. I get it. - Do you? You still haven't even apologised yet. I was getting my ass kicked by some lunatic and you want me to apologise? You know what? Just forget it. I don't even know why I'm bothering to try and save this. Save what? Or marriage you mean? Because that's what you do, Zoe. It's still death do us part, remember? Yeah, well, maybe I don't think it's such a good idea anymore. Stop. You're not talking about getting a divorce, are you? Zoe, talk to me. Please tell me that's not who I think it is. No way. Why would he bother following us? Seriously? How many true crime docs do we have to watch? It's just some other hiker doing the same trail that we are. Well, I'm not hanging around to find out. Zoe. Look, you can't just dangle the D word on me and then take off because of some other hiker. Try me. OK, that's enough, will you please just talk to me? Nope. No thank you. Zoe, stop. I'm serious. This is not exactly the best place to be having this conversation. Let's just get off this island and then we can talk. Are you leaving me? Not right now, I'm not. You know what I mean. I don't know, maybe. I don't wanna lose you. Can we please just go? Why? Because some random guy's following us? You know, this is ridiculous. What are you doing? What does it look like I'm doing? I am waiting and letting him pass. Oh come on, don't. If you wanna leave Zoe, then go for it. Jason. Pick up your bag and come with me right now. - Why should I? - Because it's him. OK. That's enough. What are you gonna do? I'm gonna reason with the guy. He just followed us to another island, does that sound like he wants to reason with you? I don't know, Zoe, but Jesus Christ, what else can we do? Let's go, right now. You can keep running away from our problems, I'm not. Will you just drop the stroppy child attitude and get serious? This guy is going to kill us. No, he's not. People don't just do that. Let me handle this. What do you want, Michael? It's OK. Alright, I'm just, have something for you. You dropped this last night. You followed us all the way out here, just to give me my wallet back? Why would you do that? I have my reasons. Like? I feel terrible about last night. And I wanted to talk to you guys. Well, thanks. Yeah, I'm really sorry about last night. Let's just put it behind us, yeah? It's too late for that, Jason. You got me. She thought you'd come all this way out here to kill us or something. No. Eventually, yes, but we've got all day first. What? Work phone. You. Phone, now. What do you want? To educate Jason. You still have two strikes, Zoe, so go. What if I say, "No"? Take him. You'll just let us go? For now. Take him. Go on. Go! Run! Wait. No, no, gotta keep going. We'll check it when we can. Come on. Wait, wait. Shit. That's your fault. Why couldn't you just apologise last night? And why the hell did you have your work phone on you? Look, I can explain. Nothing to explain. You are a liar. Can we deal with this later, please? Later? You are not gonna be able to charm your way out of this? I know, Zoe. OK, so what now? Our best bet is to make it over the trail and get back to the boat. Some great thinking. - What do you suggest that we do? - Hush. Voices. There's people up ahead. Come on. Oh, thank God. Come on. Hey! - Help! - Oh, we found you. - Are you guys OK? - Someone's trying to kill us. OK, meet us at the fork. You're OK now. Are you injured? He hit me in the side, around the kidney. I'm a nurse, let me take a look. Alright. Oh my goodness. Oh. It's really hard to say what that is. I mean, could be internal bleeding. How do you feel? Like I'm dying. Are you sure you didn't like, fall and hurt yourself or something? Look, we're not lying. There really is someone trying to kill us, can you help? Please? OK, I'll go and talk to him. No! No. just call the police or something. There is zero reception around here. Be quicker to send a smoke signal. Look, I'll go and find out what's going on. I'll go with him. Hold up, Danielle, I'm not sure that's such a good idea. Just let the poor guy take care of it, that's what we're paying him for. Seriously. Listen to her. I'm not gonna let him do that on his own. OK, well I'm not gonna let you go alone either. You guys just wait here, we'll sort this out, OK? We should stop them. Don't go. Please. Hi there. Hi. Look. We don't know what's going on with you three, but we just wanna calm the situation down. I don't think so. But this is your chance to go. Look, we just wanna make sure no one gets hurt. And all of you agree as a group? It counts as three times in my book. OK, calm down. What's the matter with you, man? You two might wanna get a head start. Gah! What are you gonna do with that? I hate weapons. Wait. Take it. It's OK. You were just trying to be helpful. It's OK. It'll all be over soon. Oh. 15 seconds. OK. Now you're ready to listen to me? Good. We'll hide in the ruins, we'll wait for Michael to go past. And then we'll turn back and steal his boat. That's a good plan. If I make it that far. Oh, you'd better not die on me. I'd be really annoyed with you then. Come on. You OK? Yeah. Liar. Come on, show me. Don't call me that. Well, you are. I have no excuse about the work phone. Or any of my behaviour over the last few years. I messed up our business and left you to pick up the pieces while I ran away, got a job. And for that, it's so much more. I want you to know in case I don't make it out of here that I'm really, truly sorry, Zoe. And I promise you if I'm lucky enough not to die today that I will spend the rest of my life making it up to you. Let's go hide. Did you see him tracking us? Yeah. He's a pro. This isn't gonna fool him for long. We need to get out of here, quick. Agreed. What? Nothing, I just, I didn't realise how much I missed this. What, get together, you mean? Come on. Stop right there. Get back. Get back. Base, come in. Come in, base. Whoa. You don't need to point that at us. We're the victims here. Please. We really need your help. I've just seen three bodies. Hikers. We know. No, no, no, no. The man that is chasing us did that. And he is gonna be here at any minute now, so you need to listen. Listen, he's telling you the truth. We are all in big trouble unless you get us out of here. Show me your permits. What? Your permits if you really are hikers. You will have permits? OK, but we left our bags when he attacked us. Just came from that direction. Didn't see any bags. Just dead bodies. You cannot be serious right now. Normally, I would tell him to be more relaxed, but he's right. You cannot be serious. Put them on. No. Look. You story checks out, you got nothing to worry about. You don't get it. Put on the handcuffs. OK. Let's just do it, Zoe. Good. Sit. Sit? Now. Come on, mates, come on. Got a real situation here. Oh my God. What? Hi. Whoa, whoa. Stay right there. Don't move. Stop right there. Not a problem, friend. Don't move. What's the issue? Do you know these people? I don't know who they are? I'm just hiking the trail. Oh yeah? Show me your permit. Slowly. Jason Sellers? That's me. Sorry about that, Sir. We had an incident. I'm gonna have to ask you to turn back. An incident, oh my God. What happened? We're investigating. Just turn back and go where you came from. Sure thing. What's the deal with those two? Suspects. Apparently they're innocent though. How many times did they claim that? Mmm? How many times did they claim they were innocent? More than three? A bunch of times, why? Guns are such an uncivilized way to handle your grievances. Look what you've done. Another person hurt, 'cause you couldn't admit you were wrong. Stand up, you two. Stand up. Zoe. Come here. Just let her go. That's entirely up to her, isn't it? Don't you touch her, - I'll fucking kill you. - Oh. So here we are. It's your third and final chance. Stay with Jason... or leave him and live a happy life. Zoe? It's OK. So what do you say, Zoe? Do you accept? She accepts, she accepts. I'm gonna need to hear her say it, thank you, Jason. Zoe. Is it a yes? Three seconds, Zoe. Three, two, one. Yes, yes. I accept. I was rooting for you. You're free to go. Go on. Go. Just you and me, pal. Let's take a walk. No. Help. Please help. Oh God. Zoe. Fuck you. You know, there was a time I would have let you die with these on. But might as well give you some dignity. Come on. You don't have to do this. Isn't it amazing how quickly someone tries to apologise when they think they're about to die? Where is that attitude in the restaurant when you were disrespecting your wife? Just kill me and get it over with. OK. Time to die. You are so fucked. OK, let me look at you. - I'm fine, I'm fine. - Come on, come on. You came back for me. I did. And look what I took from the ranger's body. It doesn't work down here though, so we need to find higher ground. Look. There looks good. You holding up OK? I'll be OK if this thing works. OK, well there's not gonna be a better place to try it. Hello? Hello, anyone? Please. Oh come on. Hello? Hello? This is Pascan One, who's calling? Henry? I can't understand, repeat please? Henry, is that you? Jason, is that you? Where'd you get a radio? Oh. I'm sorry. Henry it's us, it's Jason. Henry we... Jason, I can't understand what you're saying, repeat please. That at the bar he started us. Jason, I can't understand what you're saying, your message is coming in garbled. I'm calling emergency services, if you can hear me, I'm calling emergency services. Jason. You think he heard us? I think we just gotta keep moving and hope for the best. We're almost at the end of the trail, just push through. Can you? I can if you can. Yeah. He's back. What do we do? Come on. I have an idea. Son of a bitch. Jason! Zoe! Can you hear me? - Henry? Oh thank God. - Jason! Shh, oh Henry shut up, he's gonna hear you. Maybe, do think he did it? He called the police, I mean. I don't know, but we gotta go. OK. Oh, there you are. Henry! We're so happy to see you. What's so wrong? What the hell happened to you? - Where are the police? - The police? Yeah, didn't you get our message? I couldn't understand what you were saying, it was all garbled. Oh shit. But I did call the emergency services. And how long did they say they'd be? They didn't say. You must be the captain. Thought you were smarter than that, Zoe. How you'll have to die too. Run. I'm only gonna give you three chances. That's one. That's two. Three. This was my favourite t-shirt. We're almost there. The boat's gotta be over there. OK. Let's go. No. no. get to the boat. Radio for help. What are you gonna do? Give him the run around, buy us time until police arrive. OK. It's a good plan. I love you. I love you too. End of the trail, Michael. End of the trail. Where's the wife? She's gone. Don't worry. I'll catch up with her. Now what? You both know what happens next. For what it's worth, I get it now. I met a lot of people like you. I take it we're not the first couple you've done this to. You sick fuck. You know what my biggest takeaway is? Enlighten me. No one ever really changes. They just say they have. You did. Ready? Good for you. Liar. This is where you proposed to Zoe? First or second floor? Fuck you. Second. I'm gonna beat my persona best. You really think I'd fall for that twice? Do you think he's still alive? No way. Good. We can't get out of here. We can't even drive that thing. Well, Henry said he radioed the park service, so let's just get back on the boat and wait for them to arrive. OK, good. 'Cause I don't wanna go hiking anymore. Come on. Thank god you got out of those clothes. Celebrating? Medicating. Come on. Be gentle. I will be. Is that your phone again? Can't be. Listen. Yeah, but I had it on the hike and then... Michael took it from me. He's on the boat. Flare gun. I'll call him out. Shoot. Works for me. Come on out, Michael. We know you're hurt. Just take the boat and leave. Missed me? You didn't even check to see if it was loaded? Let's get out of here. ONE YEAR LATER They're here. Jason Zoe Sellers Survival Tours, all the skills you need to survive in the wild. They look great. Ready for our first day? Sure am. After you. ASSAILANT
