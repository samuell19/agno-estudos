(calm piano music) (calm piano music) (ocean waves rumbling) - Died in her sleep after a long illness, died peacefully in her sleep after a long illness, does that sound better? It never mind just died after a long illness. It's more to the point. After she graduated with a first in psychology, part of Harmon Road, served 20 years as an educational psychologist. She leaves a highly regarded life's work, most notably Creative Aging and the Authoritarian Personality published by Rand. Did you get that? Good. She's survived by her devoted husband Henry, no her devoted and heart-broken husband Henry, two beloved children, Matthew a vicar in the Church of Ireland and Sarah, a speech therapist and by many dedicated friends. You charge by the line? Oh, read it back to me would you? (ocean waves roaring) Mm. Seem a bit dry to you? Well, never mind. Just put it in on Monday, the 20th. Yes, I'm aware that's in a week. You have a problem with that? (congregation singing) ♪ Thou art our God with hearts and ♪ - Shh, shh. - Let us listen now to the word of Jesus. Please sit for reading. - Sit, sit, sit, sit, sit. - Shh. - This morning's gospel is taken from Matthew. Seeing the crowd she went up in the mountain. - Daddy-- - He opened his mouth and taught them blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the Earth. Blessed are those with-- - Thomas, stop that. - And thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied. Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy. Blessed are the pure of heart, for they shall see God. Blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called sons of God. (church bells ringing) (gate creaking) - Daddy, daddy! - Um, no no, not yours son. How do you make that clear sis? - He calls all men Daddy. Stop that Thomas. - Ah! - Stop it! Still problems with your back? - How come he can sing hymns? You don't take him to church do you? - His child minder takes him. She believes in miracles. Well, did you get the summons? - Sarah, it's just another one of her entertainments. - But she's very sick. - I can't go, it's the parish bridge night. You go. - No way. My car broke down. - You mean you don't want to. - Look who's talking, you haven't been there in a year and you know well enough I can't take Thomas there. So much for your Christian charity. - You two are exactly alike, always bossing me around. - Daddy? (train horn toots) No, no no no no. - Jesus, Thomas it's only a train. Thomas please, we're gonna miss that train. Please forgive me. We'll take the next one and I'll hold your hands all the way. (tender acoustic guitar and piano music) Please Thomas, say it. - Not afraid, not afraid. - When I was little, there was a fairy living in our house you know. I was a dreamy child. I didn't want to grow up. One night the fairy sat on my bed. You had to be very still because fairies can't stand loud noises, just like you. (train roars) And the fairy granted me a wish and I wished for a child of my own who would never grow up. You'd better be careful with a fairy. And one day the fairy left, but it never came back. But it lost a tiny shoe. We still have it. It's made of spider's webs. - Hello Knopf. This is my Thomas. Say hello Thomas. Jesus, are you moving or what? - Books, she still orders a box a day, sometimes two. She doesn't even read them. She's much worse, much worse these last few days. - Good God, Knopf she can't possibly need all that. - Not anymore, much too weak to get up these days. - Really? I could have sworn. (gasps) - Jesus! - Thou shalt not kill! This creature too was made by our good Lord. - I know Knopf I remember. Any news from the hospital? - There's some mutton stew left over. I cooked it for myself. She eats only junk. I don't know anything about the hospital. She doesn't share such things with me. She treats me very badly you know. All these years and him what does he eat? - Same as me. - Caca boo boo shit. - A bad little boy. - Please Thomas! - She says I get on her nerves. She calls me names. Always complaining. Tut tut tut. She doesn't get out of bed anymore, but she can't be left alone even for a minute. I have to live in this mess. She won't even let my cats in my house. - Oh, I'll go. You stay here Thomas all right? Don't leave him alone Knopf, even for a minute. Hey who are you? Where do you think you're going? - That's Helen, she lives in the village. She's here morning, noon and night as if I didn't have enough to do. (breathing heavily) - Mother how are you? - I don't know why I have two children, since not one of them cares to think about me and yet I think of you all the time, all the time, two intelligent children, how you ruin your lives. - Not intelligent enough, you should know. You tested us to death. I can leave now if that's what you want. - Leave, leave I like being alone. Who do you think you're fooling? The only reason you're here now is that you're going to feel guilty after I die. - Oh please why do you always have to play the victim? - Oh of course you had to start that mumbling. Get my ear! Not that one, you know perfectly well it gives me a headache. Oh, a headache is a mere detail to someone as sick as your mother. So that's what you want, to kill me. I know you'd be thrilled if I dropped dead tonight, hmm? - Can't you talk? I mean something besides filthy words? Can you or can't you? Fine, don't you understand anything? Apparently not. At least you won't have to suffer through the test the intelligence test. It's the way of making her look clever and everyone else dumb. She forces everyone to do it. Hmph, even Mary Corbin, she's a plumber's wife. I'm smarter than a plumber's wife and whole lot smarter than her ex, your grandfather Henry. He can't be so smart can he since he left her? Must be a bit of a disgrace you know, having an idiot in the family. (glass shatters) (speaking foreign language) Trouble maker! - Stop yelling at him Knopf, he didn't do it on purpose. Look, my dead frog, see, frozen solid. We'll bury him tomorrow if you want. - They found tumors everywhere, mostly in the spine. There's an article about it, you know that's it. All the details about my case, results in patients treated with surgery alone were disappointing, with immediate survival at three months and all dead at 9.5 months. In the group given radiation therapy, what's the matter? Don't you understand English? It means you can write me off. You can give me a couple of months at the very most. Spare me the face. - Mother you're not a doctor. - I've been researching this stuff from all over the world for the past three years. I know more than any of them. Leave me alone now. You exhaust me with your whining. Sarah, did you bring him your little monster? - Yes, I brought my monster! - Well I don't wish to see him. He depresses me. You're much too young. That child is going to ruin your life. All your wishful thinking won't make him speak. No wonder his father left you. There are places for children like him, even if you had any sense when he was born. No one will tell him the truth! I'm the only one with any guts in this family. - She's the monster! How can she even say that to me again? - For your own good, because I worry about you a lot, a lot! - I'll never come back here, ever! - [Mother] There's no more trains tonight. (clock chimes) (sighs) - She tries to take our hope away. Never forgive her. I wish she were dead. - Dead fuck. (calm piano music) Daddy. (calm piano music) - Morning sis. I've only managed to get away from the bridge night from hell. How is she? - Well enough for me to take the next train home. - Sarah where are you going? - Good of you to make the time Matthew. I know how busy it gets Mountbellew. How many in the flock now, 17 is it? - You look very well mother. - Speak up I can't hear a word you're saying. - She must keep warm. She'll catch her death. - Sharp as a knife, Knopf as always. I've caught it already. - Well catch it more for all I care. - It was nice of you to make a sand pit for Thomas. - It's not a sand pit. It's my private beach. Since I can't go anywhere anymore. (train horn honks) That's it, Tom P. I check on him every morning. He could pop off anytime couldn't he, heart attack? - She never gets me, ever. Anyway, I don't remember. What? (growls) Say please give me the feather. Please Thomas say it. Please Thomas I know you can. I'm sorry. Oh my baby, I'm so sorry. I know you can talk in your head. I shouldn't have asked. I don't want to torment you. I do understand you when you talk in your head. Now don't be sad. I can't bear it. Okay. (laughs) (tender acoustic guitar music) (laughs) (tender acoustic guitar music) - Johnny Egan how lovely I wasn't expecting you today. Dr. Egan my son Matthew, Dr. Egan is my dearest friend Mattie, he also happens to be an excellent pediatrician. My dear Sarah is out for a morning walk with her little boy. They'll be back soon. This is is the first time in years we're all together. - I'm delighted. This is a marvelous lady you have here in your mother. - Another poem, how lovely. - My lady seems much better I have to say. - Well my children are here surrounding one. It gives one such strength. - Isn't this a great, strong indomitable woman? - Never victorious, never defeated we soldier on serene in the face of eternity, without any of course any support from Henry. I'm afraid doesn't share the opinion doctor. I hate to say this, but even though he is a professor of law, unfortunately Henry is not a very intelligent man. I gave him my test you know. - Mother, stop that. - Every day I ask myself why I chose him. It does nothing to be gained from regret. Yet I think one must die with dignity. Don't you agree doctor? Oh, pick me a bunch of wild flowers would you dear and don't be too long sweetheart? - The usual Mr. Harmon Rhodes, Paula. - We need to talk about mother Matthew. Let's go for a walk. - I'm off to the cemetery. - I have to go to town so I'm leaving Thomas with you Knopf. - Oh no, not him, no he's too strange that one. - Come on Thomas, let's jump! - I mean he doesn't know how to talk. Anyway, I couldn't. - Of course you can Knopf. Take him to the cemetery. He'd be fascinated. She's president for the Association for Humane Dutying. She's half the the membership. The other half is that fellow Manyon, the grave digger. Knopf's soft on him. Tell them what you do, Knopf. - We catch stray cats with cat nip. They can't resist it, it's sexual. - She neuters them personally, don't you Knopf? Snips off their little bollocks, snip snip. Sounds like a good cure for stray husbands too. Should we take our path along the beach? (whimsical music) - I'll sleep in the big bed. You're a new daddy. You'll sleep on the sofa. - She's not going to run my life. - He's the child. He's been bad. We have to punish him. - [Thomas] My monster. - That's when he played the harmonica for me and he asked me to marry him. Does he know that I'm dying? Did you he ever ask you about me? Answer me. - Please mother, it doesn't do you any good. - Did you know that woman, that person used to run a brothel in London? - Don't be ridiculous mother. She's a minister's widow. - What do you know? You don't know her. Or do you? Well let me tell you first she was a whore, then she owned the whorehouse and then she became a minister's wife. Your father always likes floozies just like your son's father Sarah. You're like me, you'll need up alone. - You are the very last person in the world I'm going to be like. - You'll see, you'll see. Your sister definitely can't face the truth. - You just can't help it can you? You want to make it difficult for anyone to love you. - You don't love me. You don't love me. Well what difference does it make now? Stop. I want to talk to you. Swear you'll do what I ask. Swear on your Jesus. - Jesus! All right I swear. - It's about my knickers. Dead people shit in their pants. I want mine changed after I'm dead and Knopf says no one will know it doesn't matter. I can't trust her. Well, it's your job isn't it, taking care of the dead? - I take care of the living, that's my job. I'm a vicar, not a bloody undertaker. - Yes I keep forgetting, my son's a vicar, not a priest, but a vicar, a celibate vicar. Can you explain to me how you managed to live without getting laid with my genes? Why don't you just admit to it? It's no big deal anymore, being gay these days. - I can't admit to it because I'm not. I haven't married yet because I haven't found the right partner yet. - Partner, what does that mean in queen's English? - For heaven's sake, stop that. He can't, don't you understand? Stop torturing him. (calm violin music) (rain patters) (calm violin music) (thunder rumbles) (calm violin music) (calm violin music) (rain patters) (cane pounds) - Your negligent, thoughtless and unqualified housekeeper is going out tonight. You can wash your backside yourself. I have a life, not like you. - Isn't my little doctor charming? To be frank he's a better poet than he is a doctor and he's a terrible poet. But he loves me. He'll prescribe anything. Has anyone seen Thomas's monster? We have to find it. He won't leave without it. Can't miss that train. - Do I recognize that scarf Sarah? - Probably why? - It looks remarkably like the one I gave to your father once. She gave it to you, Henry's whore. - Henry's whore, as you persist in calling her, gave it not to me, but to Thomas, whom by the way she calls by his name, Thomas, not him. She seems to love Thomas. Worse still, she seems to love father and he seems not to be driven to destruction by her. Now I've got to go. I'm taking son, him home. - My digitalis. Fortunately my charming little doctor believes in mercy killing in desperate cases like mine. The grave digger looking for business. It's a great relief for me to have this you know. It's supposed to be the nearest thing there is to a graceful death. (classical music) (cries) (classical music) - Good night good morning. (classical music) (train horn honks) Not afraid, not afraid. - What I can't hear you? I can't even hear music any more. (calm piano music) - Thomas? Thomas? Thomas, I told you not to come in here. Come to bed now now. - Let him be. Why haven't you left yet? Afraid I might kill myself tonight? It's terribly lethal you know. There's enough in there to kill two adults or four children, children who suffer can say so. At least adults are in charge of their lives usually. Maybe I should give your little monster my test after all. (train horn honks) - Not afraid, not afraid. Monster. My monster. (calm violin music) - Sarah? I think someone's stolen mother's van. - Thomas? Thomas! - He's not in his bed! Thomas! Thomas! Thomas! (Sarah cries) Thomas, Thomas! - Look look easy now Sarah. Maybe she was feeling better and they went for a spin. - No, she didn't take her crutches. Oh my God, the hand bag! - What about the bag? The digitalis, that's where she keeps it. - She took it, she took it with her. - She's taken the boy. She's gone off with Thomas. She's going to hurt him. - No no, we don't know that sis. - You don't understand. She was speaking so strangely last night. She said he wasn't in charge of his life. - Oh Jesus. - Is Thomas' Church of Ireland please? - Oh My God, it's my fault! It's all my fault! - No Sarah, we will find them. She's ill. She can't have gone far. (car screeches) (car horn honks) - Here we go! Damn! - Mommy where? - Damn, damn damn damn damn! What the hell are you doing here? - Monster. - Wonderful, just what I need. Jesus, I can' take you back. I have very, very urgent business. I've arranged everything. Now you can't stay with me. We'll have half of Ireland looking for us. I know your mother. (tender acoustic guitar music) - Is Thomas' Church of Ireland Matthew? - Sure, please Helen I need to pray. This isn't the right moment. - My nanny says you don't want me to play with him because we're not Church of Ireland. - That's nonsense, I need to-- - Are you praying to find your mommy? - Yes. - She must be happy that you pray for her. - Well my mother's not much on prayers. She never goes to church. - Yeah she does, we went to big church to visit her friend, she gone in, it's a secret, he's your father. - Not my father Helen, a father. It's Father O'Donahue, they went to school together. Priests Helen are called father. Look, why don't you go to our church now and pray for them? - My nan says were not Church of Ireland so I can't go. - Well that's not true. You can go if you want. Just tell your mother that it's your choice you want to be a protestant. - I very much want to be one. - Okay. - And I also want to be a Catholic and a Latter Day like me mum. - You say my name is Thomas I'm lost call my mother and you give this to the man behind the bar. Now repeat what I said. Don't you even know your name? I can't believe it. A speech therapist with a child who doesn't speak. Somebody explain this to me. At least she could have taught you your name. Right, out we get! Chop chop! (rooster crows) - Mommy. - Yes, yes your mother will come. Just do what I say. I have to go now. (dog barks) (truck wheels' squeaking) (truck driver yells) - Red pajamas with large black Mickey Mouse. Okay, that should be plenty. Well, we'll start looking right away. I'd say you're okay. They probably went to visit and forget to let you know. - I doubt that. That's not like my mother. - Please it could be a matter of hours. My mother is very ill. And she's a whole bottle of digitalis in her pack. She said it was enough for two adults and four children, children who suffer. - We'll do everything we can. I can promise you that. If I was you, I'd check with her friends too. (rain pattering) (thunder rumbling) - I can't believe it. Can you imagine me living there? Gosh, this man was so, he was exceptional. There he is, Pat Malone. Running my fingers through his groves really drove me mad. Holy mackerel! ♪ Holy holy God God. ♪ - Shut up, shut up. If you do that again I'll gag you. He clearly had his shortcomings. Before we had sex, he'd first fold his trousers. But I've never waited on anyone like that, never. You see I need to know what my life could have been. Yes my other lives, the ones I've missed. I mean it would have been worth it, this? Oh, let's get out of here. ♪ Holy holy God God almighty ♪ ♪ Holy holy Lord almighty ♪ ♪ Holy holy God God almighty ♪ ♪ Holy holy God God almighty ♪ - Stop bloody holy singing, I can't stand it. How come you can sing and not speak? Well bollocks, oh it's just as well you can't speak really. I couldn't hear you anyway. We're well matched we two. I'm deaf, old, sick, alone ah well. All it'll take is a little courage. But you what about your life? What will that be like? Life without lovers, without children without books? Nevermind children a whole life without books. Sod it! Now you've peed in your bloody trousers. - [Thomas] Bad hurt not nice. - Stop it, stop it, you're not going to sabotage my plans. (Thomas cries) Thomas, stop your bloody whining! Now look if the next car to the left is blue you stop whining for two hours, three! (whimsical music) See! You shut up now! (whimsical music) (sighs) He doesn't know how to go myself, so he's retarded, challenged. He's handicapped. - Handicapped over there. - He can go here, there's no problem. - Not in here. Handicapped over there. - Right. Another example of equal opportunity. Oh! What do you mean you can't? Well concentrate! - I think I should go and see Father O'Donahue. You remember him, he was my professor? - The one mother went to school with? - Helen said they went to see him last week. I think she took a shine to him. - Mother taking shine to the priest. - [Matthew] Well they're a Jesuit, they're different. It's not so much adultery, more books. - A lot of people don't feel they want to be. (people talking) - He didn't recognize me and he's not got any younger either. Still with the girls. He was the best in bed by far. When I say by far, what a waste! Stay here. Sit there! - Don't sit, don't sit. - Stay there stupid stay. (mumbles incoherently) - I'll be with you in a minute. - Shh! - Paula? (tender violin music) - You call them all by their first name father. Do you remember how you called me? You called me Paulina. I liked that. You were such a romantic. I gave you my ring. (tender violin music) - Daddy? Daddy? - But I-- (tender violin music) - Yes? Is that Matthew? Matthew Harmon Rhodes, class of '93, '94, a long time ago isn't it? Are you a vicar now? - In Mountbellew yes. Can I talk to you for a moment father? It's about my mother, it's important. I know you're close to her. - Not exactly, close no. One knows of her of course, a writer isn't she? Terribly celebrated, we met once or twice years ago. Unfortunately I haven't seen her in years. Would you give her my best? Please you'll have to excuse me. I must start my class. - I can't believe you won't miss out on the unique occasion of cleaning up this mess. - Oh stop it, Knopf, I've already told you no. What on Earth? Can you believe it? She had a horoscope drafted, mother. - Every month, yes? So what a little bit of hope is what she needs most. Less expensive than all these doctors. She doesn't need this anymore, makes her cry. When he left, we were hanging around the house for weeks waiting for him like abandoned cats. - Oh I didn't know that you liked my father that much. - Oh but I did not, not at all, not at all! - That the appeal of the eviction order has been rejected. She has to move out by the end of next month? Did you know that, Knopf? - I know nothing, nothing at all. She never tells me anything. - I can't believe my father did this. I can't believe it. - And what's more he was a sadist at heart. He used to pinch my breasts with clothespins because it turned him on. He also said he'd leave me when I got old and then he did. For years he made me live in fear. It's where I got my cancer. It amounts to murder! Well you may well ask why did I marry him? He begged me to marry him every day for a year. I might have known, a man who collects butterflies. - Butterflies. (tender acoustic guitar music) (church radio music) - Oh bollocks, oh well. It'll be over soon, very soon. - Bad hurt not nice. - One could actually get through a whole long life, with those three little words of yours, bad, hurt, nice. Of course one could do without the nice. I'd really like to know how much of this you understand. (tender piano music) I love that fishy smell in the wind. I rather fancy I may come back as a sailor. This is just a temporary test all right? Are these shapes the same or different? Tell me are they the same or different? - Different. - That's very good! I knew it, you know, I can see the intelligence in your eyes. All right once again. Different or the same? - Same. - Ah, very very good. Let's try this once again. All right, now these, are they different or the same? - Same. - Mm-hmm. All right and now these, same or different? Same or different, hmm? - Different different different different. - All right you just repeat the last thing I say. Oh well, it doesn't matter, doesn't matter at all. It's terribly sad and deeply depressing. (tender piano music) - It is his parent's house after all. What would you expect him to do for God's sake? - But he left her, closing all her bank accounts. She hadn't a penny to her name, at her age and sick with cancer. That's not obscene? That's where she keeps the fairy shoe. - The fairy shoe? Jesus! She drove him around the bend for God's sake. Every day was like this weekend. He just got fed up. - Fed up? He dumped her after 28 years. I hope someday he'll suffer like she did. - Come on, you're just cross because you've been dumped yourself. Ow! - My problems never bother you anyway. You're too busy being paralyzed by your own mother. You can't deal with strong women, with any women. You're off hiding with Jesus so you don't have to. - Dear Jesus! - Is that black magic? It has to be a joke. She couldn't have done that. - Her commit suicide? (laughs) Never in a million years! You know your mother Matthew. It's just another one of her crazy ideas. She dropped everything on the hunt to track down some obscure Celtic burial site. She's done it to me and not only once. Yes I do want her out of the house. She only uses three bloody rooms. She's had the entire west wing shut down. Everywhere is covered with dead flies and mouse shit, so yes I am sending her. I offered her half the money so she could buy herself a flat. Ah, she didn't tell you that did she? I thought not. Let me speak to your sister. Sarah, listen darling, don't worry about Thomas. Your mother is eccentric, but she wouldn't hurt a fly. She'll be back tonight like nothing has happened. - Yes, yes I know. How are you father? - Oh I'm fine. Well no actually I'm having an operation next week. It's the old water works I'm afraid, prostate. Well that's it I guess, I'm getting old. - Never ever met again, but I know our feelings didn't change. Even if he got fat or lost his hair, we'd live together happily James and I in one of his beautiful houses surrounded by books and paintings and in evenings we'd sit together reading poetry. He'd recognize me in spite of my age. Dear, dear James. (sings quietly) What was that? Thomas what did you say? You're like a little bird. You don't even know you'll die one day. Come away with human child to the waters and the wild with a fairy hand in hand. It's called The Stolen Child, I've forgotten the rest. I've forgotten and you don't care. (tender piano music) (Polaroid clacks) Well at least my dear James will always remember me young and beautiful. Holy mackerel! (whimsical music) (car wheels whining) Could have waited a day before calling out the guards. You must be my karma Thomas, my burden in this world hopefully not in the next one. You won't believe this, but Doctor Johnny Egan really wanted me, those mature women. Listen to this, oh late paradise of mine, let me be the ocean of your delight. Ocean of your delight, isn't it touching? I already regret turning him down. You listening, Thomas? Oh my God! (whimsical music) - Oh what have you done? - Flowers grandma flowers. - You're his grandmother? You can't let a kid like that wander around on his own. You owe me 50 pounds, eight hours of work, plus the flowers. You pay me now or you want me to call the guards? - Why don't you? I don't know this child. Poor little boy, you call everyone grandma do you? If I were you, I'd call the guards now. They'll find his parents. You'll get your money back. Of course they might have lost him on purpose. - Wait! I can't leave my shop now. Would you mind taking him? (whimsical music) - Not bad for a girl of sheltered upbringing. I hope my mother saw me. She never kissed me, never. Do you name someone you love Paulette? Paulette, Paulette? I was happy when she was dead. - [Thomas] Red flower. - Well they found the van. Apparently they're well enough for her to steal a car, a Mercedes, can you believe this? Mother has stolen a car from a dealer. I wonder the full cost. - A good German car, very wise. ♪ She is a-courting one, two, three ♪ ♪ Pray, can you tell me who is she ♪ ♪ I'll tell me ma, when I get home ♪ ♪ The boys won't leave the girls alone ♪ ♪ Pulled me hair, stolen me comb ♪ ♪ But that's alright, till I go home ♪ ♪ She is handsome, she is pretty ♪ ♪ She is the belle of Dublin city ♪ ♪ She is a-courting one, two, three ♪ ♪ Pray, can you tell me who is she ♪ - Why are you staring at this child?

Well that's a manner of speaking.

(church bell rings) Thomas? (people clapping) Thomas? Thomas stop it, stop it. Thomas, stop staring at the man. Thomas, don't do that. Don't stare at people, all right then. You have to eat healthy. Now what do you want noodles or chips? No, I said noodles or chips? - Chips. - Now let's hear that again, chips or noodles? - Noodles. - Are you completely obstinate or what? Will you make up your bloody mind. You little, you little monster! You need to learn some manners. Just look at me! - Aren't you ashamed of yourself? Beating up on a poor little kid like that? Somebody else call the guards. - They're not going to sit here and watch this. - Oh I can't. Is that it? Bravo for your performance. You better start behaving yourselves. We can't take any more chances like that. We still have the big job ahead of us. Come on. (tender piano music) - Now how is she? Is she upstairs? - Doctor Egan can I have a word? Your mother? - My mother left last night with a six-year-old handicapped child and a pint of digitalis. Considering her state of mind, we have the most serious fears for their safety. Now if I am to assume correctly, you have allowed her to stock up on this product with your generous prescriptions. - Well frankly frankly now I can't remember, I may have given it to her once or twice, but hold on Matthew your mother is terminally ill. She needs all the help she can get. - You may call me vicar. And let me assure you of this doctor. If anything should happen to either of them, you will be in serious trouble. The register will only be the beginning I promise you. - Stop it Matthew, you know very well she's manipulated him. - Indeed, she did not. Your mother needed to take this decision for herself and I respect that. I know my risks, but she would never hurt a child. Also if she'd had a little bit more love and support from you she mightn't be in this situation. - That's true what he says. You don't even know how much she cares for you. I shouldn't be saying this, but she had these cards printed. She even stamped the envelopes. (tender violin music) - Hideous. Looks like she's hired Knopf's grave digger to do her garden. I bet there's a gnome on her lawn. Thomas get back here, Thomas! - Grandpa, grandpa. - Thomas, Thomas come on now back here. Thomas come back here, shh stop your bloody wailing. Shh, listen! This is not a joke! Jesus, look at her! She's a sack of bones, stick insect! He only likes voluptuous women, so you've got to wonder. Sure he ties her on the bed with a clothesline so he can pinch her breasts. Maybe puts a dog collar on her like in the Story of O and she's on all fours barking. He puts jam on her, on her business and then he puts the ants. - Ant butterflies. (sniffs loudly) - See, that's all he's interested in, sex! He doesn't care if she's stupid. She only reads books on how to fold a napkin. He's killing me. He must be punished do you understand me? He must! - Oh they're recovering from the operation. They'll be gone from here tomorrow. Sarah if I were you I wouldn't worry so much. I mean for your son, maybe nothing will happen to him. - What do you mean for God sake? Did she tell you something? - No no no nothing at all. Oh she never tells me anything. It's just that I feel bad for you worrying so much because maybe she's not going to kill herself at all. Maybe she's not even that sick you know. - I'm afraid she is. I saw her X-rays. It's very kind of you to worry about me. I know it's difficult for you too. We must keep our hopes up. We'll find them. (whimsical music) - Water please my dear. Always at bloody dinner time. Gentleman. - [Policemen] Mr. Harmon Rhodes sorry to bother you? Your wife hasn't called this way by any chance? - I think you mean my ex-wife and no, no I haven't seen her for two years, although I hear she's out on the move. - [Policemen] It's just that we're a bit worried. We got a call on the blower to tell us she's got a child with her. - My grandson Thomas, but gentleman the lady is prone to take off at short notice for as long as I've known her. - She's had some cards printed for after she's dead. - She has, has she? Well really, she'll do anything for attention. - Bloody wimp! Wanker! - Gentleman, she'll turn up tonight as if nothing had happened. Now if you'll excuse me. - Of course you're after dinner. Sorry for taking up your time. (whimsical music) - What are you taking drugs? - What oh that? That helps me relax. - Ah relax you need that, a vicar? You don't find God relaxing enough? - Sometimes I need this, for Christ's sakes. - My mother, my mother thinks-- - I know what your mother thinks. She told me you were when you were 15. Thank God I have no children. I largely prefer my-- - She can kill herself right away. I couldn't care less. We'll be nicely mourning and we'll finally be free to live our lives and you know maybe I won't need a psychiatrist anymore. - Stop that you're drunk. - Maybe, maybe not. ♪ And God said ♪ - Thomas, shh! (couple talking in muffled tones) - There they go. Now she'll start doing all her odious tricks. - Yes, yes, I know that officer. Well they've asked us to stay put. Well the search warrant's out now. If there's nothing in the morning, they'll widen the search. Oh Sarah please, I'm sure they'll do what they can. Good Christ sis, look at this! - What? - Paula Harmon Rhodes addresses the conference, Irish Women for Change it's mother so. - [Matthew] The date, look at the date! - July the 10th, but that's last week. - Last week in Dublin! Our bedridden mother was up in her pins talking to ladies who lunch about aging gracefully. Knopf, would you care to explain this to me? - Well I tried to explain to Sarah, but she didn't listen. (whimsical music) - Hold that, don't let go! Come on! (whimsical music) - Can I have mommy? - Shh! (whimsical music) - Mommy? (whimsical music) Mommy? - Leave me alone. You won't stop me from doing what I have to do. - My mommy. - Stop! - My mommy! - Sit down, sit here and don't budge, don't budge. (whimsical music) - Not afraid, not afraid. Not afraid, not afraid. - His books he said he couldn't bear my mess with the books anymore. Mess, what mess? You walk into the living room, you have my travel books and art to left, Irish classics to the right and contemporary plays on the upper shelves. That gets you into the right end, with all the modern English fiction to left and American fiction to the right. I admit psychology and medical got a bit out of hand. Well so what, so what? - Same. Different. Same. - That's very good Thomas. That's very, very good. (laughs) I don't think I have enough anger left anyway now that I've seen her. I thought we'd keep each other from growing old sadly. Maybe I just made him up. Or maybe he wasn't the right man for me after all. Isn't that a funny thought? After 27 and a half years of marriage. Thomas! You didn't do that did you? Oh well. It'll take a little more courage that's all. (dog barks) Count on me, Henry. My death will sit on your conscience. You'll never be able to touch your old hag again without thinking of me. - I don't understand are you sure? - Here, see for yourselves. I'd always personally supervised her tests at her request, but you know her. - A mistake possible? - Certainly not, your mother's been in the clear now for two years, a remarkable remission. I haven't seen anything like it in years. - [Matthew] Well I must say it's good news, excellent news. - She's been faking it all these months. She's been faking it. - I told you she just tries to get on our nerves so we have to pay attention to her. - I don't know. - Whatever she's up to, she definitely has no reason to take her life. - Man from Ennis jumped off there last week. It was in the Times. Oh I'd never have the guts to do that. First I'm not mad about heights and then I wouldn't want to be found totally messed up. Poor thing, sure it was loneliness that drove him to kill himself. You know no one to love anymore, no one to touch, living as though you are already dead. - Dead bird. - What? You think you have time to feel sorry I mean as you're falling. All right now go Thomas there, all by yourself you go, all right you go and they'll take you home to your mother. Go on, go on! Go on, go on! (tender violin music) - Nice Thomas, nice Thomas, nice Thomas! - Oh, you're a nice boy. Nice Thomas, yes, come on now. Come on. Do you want to see your mother? Come on. (tender violin music) (waves crashing) Ah, you're a nuisance Thomas. No I don't have much time left. I've organized everything for afterwards. Don't you understand? You're getting in there are you? Watch your fingers. Everyone has the right to choose their own death. It's basic liberty at times you have to take. - Grandma, not afraid, not afraid. - Don't shout! Oh. I'm not afraid, not at all. That's not true. I'm very, very scared. Let's face it. You know it's time to go when chocolate becomes your sole pleasure in life. There wipe your nose for heaven's sakes. Thanks to you I don't even have a single match stick left to fix my ear. (tender acoustic guitar music) (spits noisily) (harmonica tone rings out) (spits noisily) Don't spit, you'll ruin it. It's a keepsake. Being like you simplifies everything really. So many things don't matter. One's left with essentials. Thomas, stop that I'm too old for that. Oh Thomas. (laughs) Oh my God! (spits noisily) (laughs) (tender harmonica music) - Can't hear the waves anymore. - Stop whining. - You better watch yourself Thomas. You're making fun of an old handicapped woman. What was that what you said just now? Can you repeat that? I still don't know if you can speak or if you're just imitating me. But if you can speak wouldn't it make sense to use it? No, never mind, I suppose everyone needs a hiding place. I'm sick and I can't hear for toffee. Look what I can do. (laughs) Go on you try. (laughs) Can I get a hug hmm? I think I could use a hug. (laughs) (tender piano music) It might interest you to know that I think I've had a wonderful life. There was much love you know. Oh, I'm not saying there weren't some muddles toward the end. Maybe I'm not that angry after all. Or maybe I'm just getting old. (tender piano music) Every time I explain life to you, you fall asleep. (tender piano music) (screams) - Mommy? - Thank you my dear. Sweet Christ! - Daddy? - We don't need one, do we? Do we? What about a mommy who loves you twice as much? (phone rings) - Hello? Her son yes. Sympathy for our loss no you must be mistaken. What? That's a pretty sick joke. Yes, just a moment. (sad violin music) - [Paula Voiceover] When you read this, I shall no longer be with you. Matthew, when you're worried, you fold your arms behind your back like your father does. I'm sure you won't be that upset to hear that Henry is not your father. This man is. I loved him passionately. If God exists, he will forgive me. I'll find a way to let you know so you could avoid wasting your time in a career with no future. Still as you well know yourself, there are some private matters one might choose not to reveal ever. Sarah darling, I was unable to accurately measure your son's level of intelligence, but intelligence might not be that important after all. He's a wonderful child. Trust him. I seem to have more fun with him in one day than in 27 and a half years of marriage. Your father was a passion of my life, but he had a weak heart sadly, which means I am afraid that you are an orphan as of today. However, better an orphan than the daughter of a depraved and lecherous ape. You probably noticed, men are quite fragile and prone to stray, some even lack the most basic courage. Though you may have been hurt Sarah, you have to learn to trust again. - That's easy for you to say now. (whimsical violin music) - [Paula Voiceover] My dear Knopf, note that I wish to be cremated so as not to find myself interred by that awful person Manyon under your parsley. Through my ashes under the sea. I can only hope that where I go there will be neither cats, nor spiders. Still I'll be waiting for you. In the mean time, you might help Sarah raise that kid. He needs a strong hand. (glass shatters) - Why does she have to insist on being thrown into the sea? It's not clean. What if it's someone else's ashes? What if they want to keep her to salt the icy roads in winter? You never know. With my connections, she could have had a bargain plot. What will I do now about her knickers? - For heaven's sake, Knopf knock it off. They haven't found her yet. We don't know. We must pray for her. We must pray. I don't believe it. I don't believe she cheated on our father for 30 years. I think she's invented it all. It's her revenge. - She just wants attention, as usual. - Oh my heart. My heart, oh! Oh my heart, my heart! (spits noisily) I know you'd all be thrilled if I dropped dead tonight. Well close the door. Do you want me to catch my death? - I told you so. She's not meant to be dead. She'd have no one to order around. - I've changed my plans temporarily. (harmonica sounds) Sarah, I think your son can speak. He's talked to me. He's talked. - Please leave him alone. You're tormenting him. - I appreciate you put that back Knopf. The article on gays in the clergy in that pile is very interesting. Now will you listen to me for once in your life? Holy Christ, I'm telling you your son can speak. ♪ Holy God almighty ♪ ♪ Holy holy God almighty ♪ - Speaking of torment I should certainly need to teach him another song before I go again. Also Knopf, the next time I die, I'd love to be interred in your herb garden, white, a proper place finally. ♪ Holy holy Lord God almighty ♪ - Come here Thomas.
