(rock music) - [Voiceover] Yeah, we don't say this in New York of course, but the whole rest of the country has this expression. It's called the New York Minute. It's like oh, they're shooting and doing robberies in the street. You know they all (mumbles). Meanwhile there are condoms in the school, and the Pope is right there in a New York Minute. Which is to say it's shorter and faster than everyone else's minute, which means, I guess, that we never get enough done. Because, please, if you want a New Yorker to get some place at 8 o'clock, tell 'em it's at 7 o'clock. And for Sigrid 7 o'clock becomes 9 o'clock for a wrong reading. Oh, and here she is folks. Details Magazine, New Yorker Magazine have claimed that she is the writer to watch. She's poised to release her first novel. We are poised to please welcome the beautiful, the dynamic, (audience applause) - I'm trying to find something, what should be my novel in progress is yet untitled. No, I lied, it does have a title, Fear of Fiction. My problem is I haven't gotten up the courage to really begin writing it yet. Let's see, I just have some scraps here. You have no idea how many well-intentioned friends have taken me by the hand and said Sigrid, it must be intimidating having a world famous novelist for a father. Yeah right, is this allowed? - [Crowd] Yeah. - Well, he always was my toughest reader. Let me just say that daddy's a lot less intimidating now that he's dead. - [Crowd] Woo! - Glacier Lake Dream, number 47. I was gazing out from the old boathouse shivering, and watching a distant thread of light illuminate the black lake. Smells of dead fish and seaweed filled me with anticipation. Another flash, but, excuse me. Back lighting his gleaming silhouette rising up from the water up towards me. His long blonde hair greened with seaweed. Now, I felt his weight upon me, and his skin was slippery like black eels, and his cold dripping cheek was against mine. Then I noticed two tiny gills flapping softly before his ear. I struggled to free myself, but he was so slippery and all over me at once I felt I was bursting with eels inside me. Eels up my legs, up my vagina, eels churning in my stomach, choking me in my throat and something I, I can't read this. * So you wanna be a writer * Go ahead and see if I care * Write a story about my life, me and my long blonde hair * Na na na, it's your time * Do what your mind tells you to do * When it's over, think it over * So you wanna be a singer * Go ahead and see if I care * Sing a song about my life, me and the things I share * Na na na, it's your time * Do what your mind tells you to do * When it's over, you better get over me * - That was an embarrassment to both of us. Oh shut and think, damn it. Oh, come on, call somebody. Not him. France, Sigrid. - [Voicover] What okay, hello? - Did I wake you, what time is it? - [Voiceover] Sigrid it's two, are you all right? - What are you doing this summer, you busy? - [Voiceover] Sigrid you're crazy, why? - Well, I haven't even told Columbia yet. I'm supposed to start teaching next week, but my publisher got me some tickets to London, Paris. Book fairs or something. - [Voiceover] You should go, you might pick up some young man. Go to sleep. You haven't done anything foolish like last time? - Fuck you. - [Voiceover] I'm really worried about you. - Well, night. Call me, not too early. This be another of your space cadets. - [Voiceover] He's just a puppy. An adorable puppy. - Sigrid? - Yes, you look confused. - Yeah, from over the phone I thought you were... - Younger? - Yeah. - How complimentary, why don't you have a seat. - So, I'm going out next week sometime. And I'm looking for somebody to, you know, share the gas and stuff. - Of course. So Red, tell me about yourself. - Yeah well we really plan to go camping. Check out the south, Memphis, New Orleans, San Francisco. - We? - Yeah I haven't really looked on a map, so. Are they online? (laughs) - How would you like to take a little detour? Go up to Niagra Falls across Canada, down through the Rocky's. - That's all the way up north. - My destination's Washington state, I'm going out to a remote lake, my family's cottage. - I don't know, because that's like taking me off on a whole different trip. - Well Red, maybe we are going in two different directions. However, I do know some delightful little spots you won't find on any road map. (laughs) - Okay, there's just one other thing. My car is parked at my parent's in Bingleton, so you'd have to hook up with me there. - Meet your parents? How charming. (laughs) Stop, stop! - Sigrid? - Mrs. Hopkins. - Please don't. Call me Kate. (laughs) I love your sandals. - Oh these things? You know I was really looking for something more open at the toe, yes, with a strap like that. - Well these are nothing special, Nine West $39.95. I got them at the downtown Bingleton mall. - Mom. - You know the sale's going on until tomorrow, we can just pop on over and get you a pair. - Oh, shopping is so hard in New York, I would love to check out the Bingleton mall. - I've got a brand new (mumbles), now you haven't lived until-- - Mom, I thought you were going for groceries. - I am, I'm just gonna help Sigrid. - Mom, I told you before we're going as soon as she gets here, okay? We're getting on the road. - Timothy, please don't be rude. - Well you don't listen. - I do. - Mom, just go. - I am, I am. Well, it's nice meeting you Sigrid. If you'd like to stay for lunch I'm gonna pick up some deer's meat. - Mom, bye. Darn, the battery probably just needs some... Hey. - Oh, surely you don't mind if I smoke. Even with the window open? - Sorry, I do. - I'm not riding four days without a cigarette. - Well it's my only request. - Christ, be a little tolerant. - Well, even a little bit of smoke makes me sick. Think of it as a golden opportunity to quit. Oh. It never has worked since I've had it. - I wish I'd known. You bring a tape deck or a box? - No, sorry, we'll just have to talk. - Do we need company? - This is my twin brother. - You never told me you had a twin. - Tom, this is Sigrid, she might be driving down to the west coast with us. - I know, Gertrude told me. - But how did you two arrange this? How did you know when to be out here? This can't just be a coincidence, you called him? - We never spoke about it, did we Tom? - This is fascinating. I mean I've heard of twins having some kind of mental telepathy, do you two have-- - We do. - We talked. (laughed) - Tom look at the sharp turn. It's scientific. And you know they didn't give him vinegar, they gave him juice to let him sleep. - Right, then Jesus didn't die on the-- - Cross? Why do you think they call it a crucifixion. First thing he said when he appeared, he said he was hungry. Do spirits who are hungry eat? - That's the whole point, He was in His human form, resurrected. - Yeah, and his human form walked of and traveled all over India and then died there an old man. - Right, you think Jesus would be so sneaky as to hide out for 50 years, in India, deceiving the world. - Yeah. - Yeah and the rest would be a-- - Sham, you said it not me. And it's all Saint Paul's fault. - But look at what Paul accomplished, he was-- - A woman hating ego maniac. - Yeah, I saw this thing about your Saint Paul. - Another nasty old woman hater, but this Paul I can believe in. Patron Saint of the painters. Beats Van Gough. - Don't change the subject. - Wait, this is exit 35 but we were supposed to take 34, damn it. - Okay it's next house, it's right here. You haven't seen Gertrude and Ray? - [Voiceover] In Bingleton, no. You going to Gertrude's? - Voiceover] Ray's, it's for a favor. - Gertrude's been talkin' 'bout you, Red. - Red, Gertrude has been talking about you. - Hey, Ray. - Please, come in. Gertrude's feeling a little under today, but she'll be out. Can I fix you anything, we're drinking Scotch. - I mean, the New York art scene. - I know. - But, who cares. - They'd flip over this, twins doing mirror portraiture. You two would be very (foreign language). - The art scene is all vanity. - Yeah but Tom, it's like suddenly everybody in New York is into portrait painting. I might even be in this big portrait show next fall. - You know I've been doing portraits up in Ithaca for years now, I don't have to play their games. - How will people see your work? - People, you don't mean people you mean the New York art world, that's not people. - Why be so defensive about showing your work? - Red, I'm not being defensive. - You and I can't see or hear any vibrations, but they're as real as radio waves or T.V. She can feel them. - Hello Greymoon. - I like my boys. - We like you too, Greymoon. - It's good to see you again, Greymoon. - Go ahead, ask 'em a question, Red. - Well, it's about our trip out west. - We were planning to go visit our friend Carla. - Wait a second, Tom, don't-- - But, what, I'm not asking that. - No I mean before... Let's ask something different. - My boys, Greymoon see a great blue sky and a great flat plane that you cross. Red, you want to take trip with Tom, but you bring here this lady. Young lady, why you come to visit Greymoon? You have no children, why you have no children? You come to me for help? - Thank you I'm not accustomed to speaking with spirits (laughs). Okay, I have a question. Why can't I write my book? - You afraid. You mixed up young lady. You want to write, you afraid to write. You going home, you afraid going home. Oh, someone come near want to speak to you. - No, let me help you with that. Get one, here. - You're so stupid. You left me all alone, but you come back now. We be together forever. - Red, if we're gonna make Canada by daylight... - Yeah I'll be right down. I still want us to go out together, I don't know what happened. I just assumed you'd change your mind at the last minute and hop in the car with us. You mad about something? - No, I've got Ray's portrait. - I could wait, I mean I could even do one too. Come on, do you wanna go camping? It'll be fun. - Red, I don't mind if he comes along. - After what happened last time with Carla, I just don't get it Red, why'd you have to bring that woman along? - Sigrid? You don't like her? - Have you ever seen Gertrude act so weird as she did with your friend? - I didn't see anything different. - Yeah, well you wouldn't. Well I saw it. There was definitely something weird about today's thing with Greymoon. Something bad. - Hey, let's wrap it up gentlemen, aye? - I just feel like-- - Like what, just tell... All right, I knew this wasn't gonna work with Sigrid and everything, I knew you'd do this, that's why... Whatever. All right it had to happen like this. Have fun with Greymoon. We're not leaving until the smoke is out. - Red, wait, wait! Wait! * Leave you world behind * Lose your sense of time * Follow what you find * Worlds inside your mind * Life's hard to hide under purple skies * Mirrors in your eyes * Show you how to fly - I feel like I'm gonna throw up, really. - Oh for Christ Sake. - Oh God. - Christ, don't tell me you can smell my smoke from over there. - No, this is bad, this is really bad. - So? - It's Tom's. See we got 'em switched. Oh, Tom's gonna be very upset when he finds out. - Give me a break. He'll get over it eventually. - No you don't know him, these pictures are like his whole life. Oh God, I feel so sick. - Why don't you sit down and I'll put up this tent. - You know, I have no childhood memories that are mine. It was always the two of us. You know we were two parts of the same organism. - Do you know you have a really nice body? - I feel awful. My brother Tom... I mean it's not like I think he's going to, I know he thinks suicide's a sin. It's so fucked up. He can't seem to help himself. You know I'm out here, nothing I can do. - Have you ever considered therapy? - Yeah Tom's seen plenty of shrinks and stuff, nothing seems to help. - Not for Tom, for yourself. - Me? (laughs) I'm not crazy. I just feel like I'm abandoning him. - But you see that's so sick, you act like going off to live your own life is some sort of betrayal. You've gotta make that-- - Tom, he's up. What do you think I'm trying to do with this whole trip out to Oakland, visit Carla and everything. - Who's Carla? You in love with her? - She's like you. She's really smart, interesting, mature older woman, sort of a bitch. (laughs) - I like her already. - No, well, she's Jewish, but she lives on this Christian ranch outside of Oakland. - Oh wait, you're telling me she's some kind of ranch slave to some Christian fanatic like David Koresh? - Tom, that's so... You'd never understand. - You just called me Tom again. - It's sort of messed up with Tom and all. Tom loves her too. - Oh, you swiped your brother's girlfriend. What's wrong? - Tom. (barfs) - You all right? - The cops out here are real jerks. (laughs) - I detect that you're not too fond of our O.B.P. - O.P. what? - Are you from the states? Oh, the Ontario Bridge Police. - Yo the O.B.P. just threw my stuff all over the highway. What's that rap, it was something about O.P.P. - Well we have our own O.P.P. and you just don't wanna mess with those fellas. What? - You a priest? - Is it that obvious? I am a, was, a judgement for the society of Jesus. You familiar with judgements? - Well I'm Roman Catholic, too. It's not that I'm into the Pope and stuff like that. I believe in the mystical body of Christ. - You say that with such simple conviction. That's good. I admire a person that can declare his beliefs. Well Tom, you're a lucky man. Because in me you found a companion willing to take you clear across Canada. (light music) - You know, I've been meaning to ask you. Your name is spelled with a double S. - Right. - And an N in the end. - Right. - That's a weird way to spell Anderssen. - So what? - Freshmen lit, we had to red this book, Spiders... Spiders something. - Spider's Child? - Yeah, yeah you know it. Well, I was thinking-- - Stop, this is the stupid game right, we're playing stupid. - No, no no no, I was just wondering if that was-- - My father? Yeah, my father T.E. Anderssen wrote Spiders Child 50 years ago. Along with 6 others that are still in print. - Whoa, man, that must've been intimidating. I mean for you, having a famous writer for a father. - Christ, smoke break, pull over. - Hey Sigrid, maybe you should try meditation, you know? To focus and relax. You're like Tom, he's always, like he's about to snap, and I'm like Tom that's not you. Just imagine you're that cloud floating by, just float along. Sigrid? Sigrid? Hey Sigrid it's getting kind of cold out here. You know what, I'd really like to try to make it to Thunder Bay, you know? Before it gets dark. - Damn it! - Sigrid. Oh shit, Sigrid your papers are blowing. I think I got all of it. Why are you so mad at me, you threw your papers away and I picked 'em up for you. - I just want a goddamn cigarette. - You just smoked practically a whole pack of cigarettes back there. Anyway you said yourself before you wanted to stop. Hey, you got something. I wonder where the signal could be coming from. Damn it it's going. - Almost. - Faith is such a precious thing, Tom. I seem to have misplaced mine. Fortunately before taking my final vows. I guess my only reason for going back now would be the beautiful altar investments. Mother church really knows how to dress a man. - It's all fucked up. - What is it, my nose? You can fix that, can't you? - No, no it's my life. I messed things up, it's my fault, it's always my fault. (mumbles) - After mother and daddy split up we were still kids. Daddy had us every summer at our cottage on Glacier Lake. But the thing was, every night daddy would lie with us with his boozy breath. The poor old bed would sag. But he would make up really scary stories. - Ghost stories? - Well, there was a monster with a queer name, Mr. Basketball Head, he lives at the bottom of Glacier Lake. Then when the moon rises over Glacier Lake, he slithers to the surface. His white bloated face scanning the shore for stray children. Two kids out paddling in a canoe, lost in the night fog. Suddenly, Basketball Head lounges up and snatches them and drags them down, down, down to this evil layer, at the bottom of the lake. (laughs) - So that's what you were writing about back there at that goose, Mr. Basketball Head? - He had an arch rival, a horrible brat named the Submariner. Who terrorized the cottages but seduced all the girls. - Here. - But, I have my own character, my own story, which is... - Which is... - I look hideous. - Where are we? - The fabulous thrifty motel on downtown Soo Saint Marie. We could share a double for the same price, what do you think, that's affordable. - No no no, I gotta keep moving? - What? Tom, you've gotta sleep sometime. Come on, let's just knock it off for tonight and we'll pick it up again in the morning. Come on let's go in, what do you say? Besides, I'd be interested to hear more of your views on church dogma and quite frankly, I'm really encouraged by your pride in faith. There were twin beds and we could each share. I assure you I have no carnal intentions, even if God forbid you could think-- - Hey, thanks for picking me up Gary. - Oh now Tom, come on, you, Tom this is ridiculous. You're being an idiot and you're not gonna get a ride this time of night, now you're being a goddamn idiot, a goddamn fucking stupid asshole. Fucking asshole. - Sigrid, the tent's all ready. - I'm sleeping out here. - Why? - The cold air smells so good. Can really think out here. - I think it looks like it might storm. - I appreciate the offer Red, goodnight. - Hello, hey hey hey, watch the nylon, every time you touch the nylon it drips. - It's dripping already. - Move over this way, there's plenty room in the middle. Wait. You look like you've seen a ghost. (laughs) Here let me help. Didn't they teach you in Girls Scouts you're not supposed to wear all your clothes inside your bag no matter how cold? - I was never in Girls Scouts. - The information factor, even when 10 below zero, never wear your clothes to bed. See what we always do is put your clothes in the bottom of the bag to help keep you warm. And another trick you can do is to zip the two bags together. But I mean I learned that after I was in the Scouts. (laughs) But I don't think the zippers on ours match. - There's condoms in the car. - Scout's motto, be prepared. - Victor. - Victor, he's going to be something, that boy. You know what he's got? Imagination. - Stop it, why are you shaking me? - You had a bad time sleeping I thought. Maybe you'd feel better if I waked you. - Stuck out here with this goddamn boy scout. Can't write, can't think, can't sleep. - I just don't know who in the heck you think you are. You Saint John the Baptist or you're some sort of Marter? - You know, Tom is really delusional. The ancient Tantric Yogis taught that most people experience time as if peering off the back of a rocket. Time is just our view of things disappearing into the past. Like this rear view mirror. - Oh yeah the Yogis knew lots about rockets (laughs). Hey we're on empty. - Okay, no use getting excited. - Well we could've got gas back at that diner, what are we gonna do? - I don't know. But the point was that it's merely an illusion of reality. In order to perceive reality, one has to reverse one's view and look back into the flames, back to where the flames originated, back in one's own mind. See that's where everything really comes from, that's reality. - That's asinine, and no excuse for running out of gas. - Am I getting too philosophical for you? - We are fucked, what are we gonna do? - Pull over. - Why? - Pull over please, I wanna get off here. - You know, I'm not even gonna try to reason with you anymore. Have a nice life. * You're gonna see how hard you will fall * You're lost without me, you're all alone * If you come back then we'll be together * We'll be like one, we'll live forever * - Oh, look at this engine, when's the last time you put oil in this thing? - Oh, I don't know, never I guess, I'm totally (mumbles) about cars and stuff. - It's your car, you've got to put oil in it. - Well, it's not really my car, it's sort of Tom's. Tom went to a nursing home, he did this guys portrait, and the guy died of cancer and left Tom his car. Where's the oil thingy? - It's fucking dry. You know what that does to an engine? - No. - Burns out the motor, the whole thing just ceases up and dies. - Oh, Tom never mentioned anything about that. - Boom, the biggest single explosion of music to ever hit the United States of America. Kids who never even thought about music started picking up instruments and playing in their garages and it's fucking great. And nobody heard it, fucking nobody heard it, because the radios didn't play it. I'm talking about British invasion, power, or progressive. What a fucking ironic phrase, progressive rock. Progressive, it's regressive, it's... You ever heard of these bands, there were millions, millions of rock bands out there. I'm talking about the Living End, The Missing Links, The... Listen listen listen, listen listen listen. Listen to these opening chords, oh. Should've been a top hit, they all should've been a top hit. They all should've been number one, they all should've been number one hits. Listen the deal is you listen, and I drive. This car wants to be, needs to be, in Moushka by 10 a.m., and it is gonna be. - Yeah I'm sorry I'm trying to listen, I'm just a little bit tired. - Oh okay, put your hand out. Let 'em go. - I just realized something, if we're driving directly west, which we are, then in reality I don't think we're really moving at all. - On what basis? Listen listen listen. - No no no, you listen, in reality we're not. Because I mean if we're going directly in the path of the sun, then we're really driving in place, right? Like we're on this big treadmill, the Earth is spinning on it's axis, moving under us and we're floating in the same spot. I mean in terms of the universe. - No you got it backwards 'cause it's rotating east we're going-- - Duh, the Earth's spinning. Look there's the sun right, sinking before us. Not really, if we move fast enough then it won't sink because we're not really moving. Look my fist is the Earth. - Yeah, in relation to sun not the Earth. - Yeah, right that's the whole point. Look at my fist. - Okay now I'm confused, is this the sun or just the Earth? - The Earth, the Earth is spinning like that. - That's right, you're right then we'd have to be going 2,000 kilometers an hour. You wanna here the quintessential garage band? The Fabulous Failures recorded this demo in the late '60's on a 45 in Spokane, Washington, which nobody heard outside of local radio. The Fabulous Failures, that all punk bands should aspire to. * You're so stupid, you had to go, you had to go * Around the world, you left me here all alone * - I know who you've got the hots for. - For Christ Sakes. - You wanna know his name? (moans) Victor, Victor, he's a young dude right? - Sigrid what's wrong? - Victor was my brother, he died. - Oh, sorry, I didn't mean to, I didn't know. Was he older or younger? - We were born at the same time. - You had a twin brother and you never even mentioned it all this time? - I told you about Victor, didn't I? - But you never said he was your twin. - Victor died such a long time ago, 20 years. - What happened to him? - Stupid accident. He was drunk or high or something and he drowned. - How old was he? - Your age, 21. - God, that must've freaked you out. - In a weird way you really remind me of Victor. Pretty sick, huh? - But to lose your twin, I can't imagine it. - It's not important, it happened a long time ago. Goodnight. - God, terrible. What was he like? - He was the golden boy. Everyone was in love with his smile. (light music) - Only Y bands, The Kind, The Child, The Cry of Shame. The Kind and The Cry of Shame both Y bands, both very good keyboard. Only bands that are plurals, The Mad Hatters, no Y in the Mad Hatters, H-A-T-T-Y-R-S, know what you would say, you would say how is it spelled? Mad Hatters is predictional spelling, I'm almost sure Mad Hatters is a spelling... Okay, Y bands that are plural and also Eastern Mississippi. - [Red] This ride is so monotonous. - You poor thing. I know I've been sort of a bitch on this trip, but sometimes that means I'm about to get serious about someone. - Serious? You mean like romantic? Well, I always figured you wanted to get on with me, have your fun, get off at Spokane. I don't know, I'm not really sure what you think of me. - What difference does it make, we're here now. And I seriously feel like getting lost, would you get lost with me? - Jesus Christ, I am dead meat. 45 minutes late. - I'm awake, I'm listening. - Fuck you are. - Wait it's Sunday isn't it, what time is it, did we cross the timezone yet. - No, no it's quarter to 11, god damn it. - That's it, I can still make it. Drop me off at this white church. - No way, Berader is gonna hit me for fucking late charge, fuck I'm late. - Did we cross the timezone yet? - Not for another 50, 60 miles, it's quarter to 11. - Good, good, I can still make it. - Whoa, didn't the guy at the motel say not to turn off the engine unless we were at a garage? - Yeah. - You sure you don't wanna come celebrate Catholic mass? - Oh no you have a ball, I'll be right over there at that laundromat. - Where's your laundry? - I do my best writing in laundromats. - Submariner grabs me with his webbed fingers and leads me down between the cottages. He grins, come see my latest prank, it's so weird. - Siggy look, my latest prank, it's such a catch. I got you right here, it's so far out, I'm talking so fast your fingers can't keep up. - Pardon me, I know who you are. You are a very disturbed individual. You need help. You're not gonna get it from me. - Hey wait. - You still around? Long live The Fabulous Failure. - Well I got your battery charged but you definitely shouldn't have this thing out on the road. The rear end's gone, the transmissions shot, the engine mounts are pretty much gone. Who did the repairs on this thing? - I don't know, but I think he's dead. - Oh God, there he is, that's Tom, damn it. - Where were you? - I've been looking all over for you. - I was looking for you. - Here? How come you weren't over at the laundromat? - I gave up. I went to the church looking for you, you weren't there. Red-- - Tom, the mass wasn't, they weren't really Catholic so... I just saw Tom. - At the church? - No, no he was right there by the bagel place. - Oh right, and Elvis Presley picked him up. - No, he's here. We're not leaving until we find my twin brother. - Relax, personally I don't think you saw Tom. But if you did, somebody's picked him up, he's already ahead of us. - Okay, well let's catch him. - Red, Red! - It's amazing how that just appeared. Oh, it's such a relief after all that total horrid monotonous. - Where could he go, is there another route he could be on? - Not until we get to Beth. Anyway, that's where all the hitchhikers are going. * My thumbs been up so long I'm dying for a break * And I'm stranded up in Beth for two, two days straight * The kid was such a drag * We couldn't find the key * I told the band I'd change to D * - There's this cute place my family used to stay inside of The Rocky's towards Spokane. I know a way there that's not on this map. It's kinda tricky but the views are definitely worth it. - No, we gotta stay on the main road so we can find Tom, okay? I mean you act like you don't give a shit about that. - Smoke break. - [Voiceover] Oh, try to say something nice Siggy. - Listen, the park authorities don't let you hitch on the main highway, I hitched through here before I know where to go. - Well, then why don't you drive for once. - Really? - And I can look out for Tom. - I thought you'd never ask. - Red, Red. Why is it whatever's mine, always somehow ends up in your hands always. The vinyl collection, you copying my art, you driving out to Oakland in my Delta '88 going to see Carla without me. It's all my fault. It's all my fault. - Hey, hey looks like Tom slow down. No it's not him. Hey, hey we don't need company. - Roll down the window, I just wanna ask directions. - Hi, do you know the way to Colliver's Creek? - Oh yeah, you wanna take this down for another two miles or so and then hook a sharp right, and then another right. Matter fact, I'm almost going to Cover Creek myself, I can guarantee you safe passage. - What did you say your name was? - George. - Hop in, George. This is my friend Red, I'm Sigrid, pleased to meet you. - You too. - Offer him some donuts Liz, looks like he's starving. Where ya headed? - I don't know, east. No west, south, just towards Spokane. - Spokane, that's where we're going. - We live in Spokane. - Amazing. - I've gotta go there , I'm looking for someone who looks just like me, my twin. - How do we know you're not him? - Winds are pretty tough out here, you ski? - Hell yeah. Bull River, top of the world, Copper Creek is dope in the spring time. - Spring's bad for avalanches. - Avalanches are a hoot. These crazy snowboarding guys set 'em up just to ride down 'em. My twin brother and I almost died doing that. Veer off to the right at this fork. - Really are you sure? I thought it was left, but it's been a while. - No right, takes us right over this pass and into Cover's Creek. - No, my car's in too bad of shape for this road. - [George] Yeah I know what you mean, just a little more. - No, you don't understand. The guy at the garage shop said that this car isn't safe. He said the whole motor was about to fly off. - So you've got a twin, George? Red's an identical twin. - Whoa, excellent. Fellow twin have a snort of my Jack. - No. - Mm, oh man, we used to get wasted on Jack in Spokane High every Saturday night. - Holy shit, you went to Spokane? I graduated from there. I never saw you around, what year did you graduate? (laughs) - '69. - [George] '69? - Shit, what is that? - My mom graduated in '69. You are one foxy lady to be as old as you are. - I really don't wanna get stuck on some stupid dead end road. - What the fuck you think is going on here? You think I'm taking you and this foxy looking lady out to the middle of the fucking woods or something? (laughs) - Come on, relax everybody. Take a deep breath. Tell us about your twin George, where's he living? - He isn't, he's dead (laughs). - I missed the punchline George. - Sh, sh, what was that. - My fucking twin came home, blew his brains out upstairs. Didn't even say hello (laughs). - Fuck. - Tom, Tom, we're here. - Tom, it's late, we're in Spokane. - You can just let me off anywhere I can walk from here. - Why don't you just come inside with us. - Yeah, we can give you a place to crash. - Really? - Sure, we love meeting new folks. - To share the joy of our new life. - We found you lost on the highway of sin. And now the Sisters of Mercy are taking you in. - Praise the Lord. (singing) - Why don't we wait, fix it in the morning, huh? George said that-- - George said. I'm surprised you didn't run off with George. You were so eager to pick him up. - Listen, he said that this way would lead us to the Mill Brook Inn. - I'm not leaving my car here unprotected, okay? Anyway we got camping gear, I'm staying. - Well have a nice time. You seen that little cardboard box that was back here? I know I left it here somewhere. - Hey hey hey what are you doing, what are you insane? - It was my daddy in the box. - What do you mean, like your father's remains? - One of daddy's last practical jokes. Last year after he died he had the crematory ship it in the state of Washington, hand delivered to me in New York with his written request that I cart the stupid thing back to Spokane to throw it in Glacier Lake. Come on Red, don't make me go off all alone. (sighs) - [Red] I can't help thinking about George and his twin. Oh man, that's like my worst nightmare. - [Sigrid] Oh honey, it's your secret fantasy. - I found it. Right where this weird blonde looking guy was standing along the side of the road, and it's definitely ashes. It's somebody's ashes. - That is the most amazing story-- - Yeah, but I'm not finished. Look at the name on it. - Sigrid Anderssen? - Yeah, that's who my twin brother is traveling with. - And you found it. - Miracles are alive today right here in Spokane, Washington. - That's bond. - Brother Tom, you don't have anything against sharing a doobie with our Lord do you? - It's killer herb. A sister of ours down in Oakland, California is a agriculturist. - Yeah, like you know the medieval monks who brewed these super brandies in our Lord's name. - Yeah. - I wonder if George is still out there. - I don't give a fuck where he is. (laughs) - You're still angry with me? Don't be such a wuss. I hope you can stick around awhile when we get to the lake. I'm a little afraid to be left all alone on the Glacier Lake. - You said being alone would be good for you. - Good for my book, not for me. Listen, I'll even pose for you, you can sketch me whenever you like. Pose nude. - As soon as I can drop you off at your cottage I'm heading down to Oakland. - Okay. - You're friend in Oakland who grew this pot, her name isn't Carla, Carla Cahayne? - Carla Cahayne? Oh, we know who you are. - You do? - One of the Hopkins twins. - Amazing, this is so freaky. This connection is totally like a sign from the Holy Spirit. I mean Carla used to talk about you all the time on the retreat. - She definitely had a thing for you. - About me, at what retreat? What did she say? Wait, was it about me or about Red, which was it? The thing she had was for me, Tom? - She mentioned the Hopkins twins. Which one was it, do you remember Debbie? - Wow, I'm confused. Was it you or Red who got Carla. Did your brother ever talk to you about... Should we tell him this? - Carla what? Why would she mess around with Red, Red couldn't possibly understand Carla's faith. - I can't believe your brother Red wouldn't tell you. - Sister Carla is with child. - What? - You can't be. Red, I thought I saw something. - You want me to go out and look around? - No, just give me a hug. * So you wanna be a writer * Then go ahead and see if I care * - Don't you, ah, Singrid you're so fucking stupid sometimes. Travel is in your mind, you don't have to go halfway around the fucking world to... Needs, needs, needs, needs, (mumbles). God, it's in your mind. That's all you ever need. Siggy please don't leave me. Please don't leave me here with this man. What am I gonna do without you? - [Voiceover] It's all my fault. I just couldn't let daddy know what we were doing in the boathouse. - Tom would puke if he saw me driving this. - Oh would you get on with it already, they told us that piece of junk wasn't worth saving, not even the parts. - It's my brother's car. - So what? He didn't want it. - You don't understand, I told him I'd take care of it, not junk it in the woods. - Quit complaining, I think you've made a very mature decision replacing his car. - [Voiceover] I'm coming, I'm coming. Stand where I can see you. (gasps) - Is Sigrid here? - Oh dear, oh dear. I get very mixed up. But I know that you've been gone, but you do come to visit from time to time. - Mrs. Anderssen-- - Not like her, she never visits. I wasn't that mean to her. I just couldn't look at her after what she did. Why didn't she take you to emergency in Spokane. Why did she let you die? - Where is Sigrid? - It's summer isn't it? She's at the lake with father and Victor. But you're here with me. Mother gets very mixed up. - Please be home. I should've called. Hi Alice, how are you? Mother. Hello, hello mother. What are we reading now? - Oh, it's terrible, just a trashy spy book. It's not (mumbles). - Torn a Curtain? I thought you finished that when I visited last Christmas. - Did I? Oh dear, sometimes I forget and I just read them over again. You've come back. Mother this is my friend Red Hopkins. We've just driven across the country together. We're going back to the old cottage. Red's very happy to meet you, aren't you Red? - Yeah it's nice to meet you Mrs. Anderssen. - All right mother, that's enough now. He has to go, leave Red, meet me outside at the car. - Why is he going so soon? I was just telling Alice that Victor and I had such a lovely tea this morning, and now-- - That's very nice. Mother is there anything I can do for you? - Yes you can bring him back, I want him to come back. - Well I'll return to visit with you mother in a few days, all right? - I want him back, where did he go? - You just don't understand nicotine withdrawal. I just feel too much. Oh, maybe I just dread going back to the lake. - When was the last time you were there? - It must be 20 years this summer. - Wow, who's been in there all that time? - Nobody except daddy after the accident. * Go on and have your little stay * Go on and make your big mistake * And when you crawl back on your knees * I'll be here waiting by the lake * Go on and waste your precious time * Go on and spin your wheels awhile * That doesn't mean a thing to me * I'll watch the water and I'll smile * Yes it was stupid when you left me * You stay alive you'll just grow old * I tried myself and now you left me * - The old boathouse, it's gone. - Is that where your brother Victor drowned? - Yeah. No, he didn't drown. He died the following day, hypothermia. I stayed all that night with Victor in the boathouse, I thought I could revive him. Really I was thinking about myself. Damn it, damn it, damn it. I called the power company twice, they assured me we'd have electricity. Here you go. The smell is the same. - So, where we gonna sleep? - I thought it might be kind of sexy here by the fireplace. Oh, these legs just keep getting bigger and bigger. - I think big legs are sexy, especially your legs. - How sweet. I have this distinct memory of sleep walking as a little kid and daddy was upstairs working at his desk and I came in and pulled out my penis and peed into his waste can. But I thought I was at the toilet, but you see, that must have been Victor because I don't have a penis. (laughs) - Identical twins begin as one, right? One spark, one soul, and for some reason we don't know the fertilized egg splits. One soul one spark, two babies sharing that unique individuality are fighting over it. I always had to ask myself, did I get it or did he? Am I some kind of a blank, cypher, zero. And it came to me, no I'm not. I'm a seed. A seed that can grow up into a tree. For the first time I feel like I can stand alone, I can be me. I am me. What was that? - What was what? - That upstairs. - I don't hear anything. Hey, who painted this. - Victor. It was the backdrop for one of his plays in which the Submariner sinks the Titanic for revenge against America. My brother started The Fabulous Failures that marked the beginning of the end. Started using the attic as his crash pad. * You're so stupid you had to go * - Should've been a monster hit. - Hey man, how'd... It's really cool that you made it here, you even got here ahead of us. - You were in such a rush to dump me in Buffalo. - Whoa fuck, fucking bats. - Oh this is gonna be fun. Just like old times, eh Siggy? - Tom seems really weird. - I know you, and you know me. Nothing between-- - Twins. - We share everything, right? Like my vinyls that ended up in New York. Like my painting, like my Delta '88. - Well the Delta '88 kinda-- - Kinda died. Oh that car was bad news, deserved to get ditched. But what about Carla? I can't remember. Did you tell me that she got pregnant with your (laughs), bummer. You like getting zonked, twimmy? Let's show her how we twinnies got blasted in third grade. - In the black top, across the street from church. - What are you talking about? - Twimmy and Twommy get zonked in front of the whole recess class, right Twimmy? - Don't call me Twimmy, Twommy. - Okay Twimmy, okay Twimmy you first. Okay Twimmy, super big huge one. (laughs) - What did you do to him? - Red and Tom. Come on these guys are duds. Don't act stupid on me Siggy, give me a smoke. - Siggy? - Isn't that what I always call you? - I don't get it. - Don't strain yourself Siggy. A whole lot of weird shit's been going on around here since you left. You can't imagine. Your old man grew his hair out, started coming up here smoking my pot, not writing a lot. * My old man started hangin' out a lot * Smokin' my pot There's other stuff downstairs, come on. Remember how the old man was always finishing up his next great novel almost done with the final chapter? Did you ever notice father never wrote a single thing the whole time we were growing up? Remember my glorious productions in the boathouse with you as my leading lady. My greatest play, The Submariner sinks the Titanic, what genius. And all I needed was a happy ending after the ship went down, what was the ending Siggy, remember? - I can't remember. - It was so funny. The two of us would go sipping tea in the bottom of the ocean. * My old man * Grew his hair out and started hanging out * - What is it? - Feels like the cottage is about to be invaded by ghosts. * My old man started smoking my pot * It's two of 'em. They think they can bogart my show. Thanks for the opening greedy bastard. - Who, do I know them? - Driving me nuts, hey, take a hike. Oh god. They say they have to meet you. - They're angels. Who are they? - They're yours, your kids. - I don't have any kids. - Well you sure do now. They were conceived right here on this spot. 21 minutes ago. - Oh my God. - Let's go. - Where? - Time for a skinny dip. - It's too cold to go swimming. - That doesn't sound like my old Siggy. And the moonlight too, how romantic. Old Basketball has been talking a lot about you Siggy. He's not very happy about being left behind like a bag of garbage by the side of the road. Yeah, yeah we hang out. Not a lot of company to chose from down there in that bottomless lake. You know it's true about what they say, it just gets deeper and colder. But you always didn't mind cold water, didn't you? Last one in's a rotten egg. - No! * Well drift here down below * Where no one else can go * Our bodies will move so slow * We're perfect down here * You were lost with without me * - Well, well, well what have we here? My little stretch worked. - Daddy. - You've returned to care for your old papa. I've been lonely as hell (laughs). - Come here, give me a kiss. - Oh, I wanna show you something. - Some thing, what, articulate, use the language, damn it. - My book, I just thought-- - Just, Just thought. Does just mean that it was barely a thought, or are you apologizing for that thought, which is what? That I'm washed up? Christ, at 43 I'd already written eight novels, and you, what have you written, another soft core travel one to embarrass me? - Hey Siggy, you wanna get high? - Christ O'Mighty. - We don't have to do a thing. - Or go anywhere. We have our own world. - Now Siggy, you did a very stupid thing. You had to have your little adventure without me. But now that you're back, everything's fine, everything's perfect. The ending is twins together, forever and ever. - Oh my God, you're a fish. Oh I'm so sorry. - Siggy it's okay, it's okay, it's okay. What did you expect, that I would grow up? That I would become some fabulous something, why? Siggy I wanted to check out. I thought it was a pretty good exit. - What are you talking about? - Siggy, I wanted to check out I thought it was a pretty cool exit. Siggy, stay with me. Sigrid, where are you going, come back. - I don't relish the thought of getting that cottage in order, so I can face making us some coffee. You boys are welcome to stay as long as you'd like. - I don't know, she might not... And she probably isn't even pregnant. But I feel kind of responsible in some way. Do you wanna stick around for a little while? Oh God, it's sort of like our whole trip's getting cut short completely. I mean this was only supposed to be the beginning not the end. Hey Tom, I got an idea, what do you say we go back up to Canada and get your car. We can go camping maybe somewhere down on the coast. - Red if I were you, which I'm not I'd get my ass down to Oakland and check in with Carla. - Somebody's gotta stay here with Sigrid. - No shit. - [Voiceover] My problem is that the cottage is still spooked. It's like were all here together again. And I can sleep at night only because Tom decided to stay behind and help me out. When I finally began to write my book, it felt as if my dam had burst. And Fear of Fiction just poured out of me in longhand in just one month. The day I went to Spokane for my embryo test and I saw my little girls for the first time... Well actually, the second. * Daddy always said I should never play with a gypsy girl * You naughty girl, your hair's not combed, your shoes don't * Shine but she's got to be mine * The lake was cold, the snake was green, she went for a * Ride in my submarine - Why must you taunt me so when I'm just about to write? * She's just a memory - [Voiceover] She should be down here with us.
