(INDISTINCT CHATTER) MAN: Mr. Schlesinger has an announcement. We'll hand out copies momentarily, so you won't have to write down what he says. He'll take questions afterwards. (TAPS MICROPHONE) (MAN COUGHS) The Atomic Energy Commission is now planning to proceed with the Cannikin test. We have now received the requisite authority to go ahead, including detonation. REPORTER: On the wind-swept island of Amchitka, final preparations for the test go on, filling the 6,000-foot deep hole with sand. The five-megaton nuclear bomb rests at the bottom. BOB HUNTER: Since childhood, when I started making science fiction comics in my school scribblers, I loved to draw. But by the time I got a place at art school, Uncle Sam and Comrade Ivan were pointing 56,000 nuclear warheads at each other and boys my age were coming back in body bags from Vietnam. (EXPLOSION) The American Dream was turning into a planetary nightmare. REPORTER: AEC scientists say they are not worried the blast will set off a large earthquake or a tidal wave. HUNTER: Drawing comics didn't seem to be enough. So I burned my college acceptance letter on the steps of my high school and set off to change the world. REPORTER: Young people demonstrated their opposition to the nuclear blasts by closing the main highway crossings at the US-Canadian border between Seattle and Vancouver. CROWD: (CHANTING) No more Amchitkas! No more Amchitkas! No more Amchitkas! HUNTER: I don't think this particular demonstration can necessarily stop it, but, um, it reflects a level of awareness that wasn't here, say, five years ago. (TYPEWRITER CLACKING) HUNTER: By the fall of 1971, I'm a columnist for the Vancouver Sun and I've volunteered to chronicle a voyage into a bomb. REPORTER: The protest ship the Greenpeace is heading for Amchitka, hoping to anchor offshore and stop the test. HUNTER: The boat is one more factor for Richard Nixon to have to consider, the possibility of some international incident involving Canadians. HUNTER: Until that fateful journey, nothing has seemed so absolutely essential to write about. But heading into the bomb, there is only this antique wooden tub between us and the icy seas. Suddenly, I'm very frightened. MAN: (OVER RADIO) Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one, zero. (RUMBLING) HUNTER: 90% of history is being in the right place at the right time. In Vancouver in 1971, we have the biggest concentration of tree huggers, draft dodgers, shit-disturbing unionists, radical students, garbage dump stoppers, freeway fighters, pot smokers, vegetarians, nudists, Buddhists, fish preservationists and back-to-the-landers on the planet. -(INDISTINCT CHATTER) -(BUGLE SOUNDING) And we are all haunted by the specter of a dead world. These are the people who will shape the next 10 years of my life. (ROCK MUSIC PLAYING) PATRICK MOORE: The idea was simple, send a boat to bear witness in the Quaker tradition of going to the scene of the crime. HUNTER: Patrick Moore has just finished his PhD in ecology. He's a bit psychedelic-looking for a scientist, but when he speaks it sounds like he knows what he's talking about. The committee's position is that it's opposed to all testing of all nuclear weapons anywhere in the world by any country. HUNTER: Paul Watson is a 19-year-old sailor who gets bored easily. Take a picture of you guys taking a picture. HUNTER: He has North Vietnamese flags stitched to his army jacket, wears Red Power buttons, Black Power buttons and just about any kind of anti-establishment button that can be imagined. No, that's Bob's, uh, interpretation of it. I don't recall wearing all these patches. (CHUCKLES) The thing is, everybody has their own view of what went down and I was considered probably a little more radical than the others. REX WEYLER: Change happens where things are mixed up, and things were mixed up in Vancouver. There was this expatriate American community, there was a Buddhist community, there were fishermen, and there was this talk about ecology. HUNTER: Rex Weyler is a Texan photographer who fled the Vietnam draft and has been chased by the FBI up to Vancouver. WEYLER: Bob Hunter was writing in the Vancouver Sun. He was talking about ecology and peace, and social change and the consciousness revolution, and it really was the best journalism in Vancouver. PAUL WATSON: But he was more than just being a writer. Bob saw himself as helping to bring about a cultural revolution. It's just such madness that, um, that it's almost a logical area to attack, because two different kinds of madness have come together there. There's the Cold War madness and there's the, "Let's pollute, it doesn't matter, "the main thing is to make a buck." REPORTER: Conservationists are making a last-ditch attempt to stop the Amchitka nuclear test. Donations have been received and are continuing to come in from all over British Columbia and from many parts of the northwestern United States. WEYLER: Bob just realized that if you wanna do a protest, you have to make a story that's going to travel well, an event that would impact millions of people in every corner of the world. HUNTER: The plan is a good one. Ours is a Canadian vessel, so the Americans cannot seize it in international waters without committing an act of piracy. I think we ought to really mind-fuck each other on this trip. (ALL LAUGHING) (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) HUNTER: The fathers of this adventure are Jim Bohlen, Irving Stowe and Ben Metcalfe, veterans of the peace movement who've recruited a younger generation of eco-freaks, myself included. The youngest of us all, Bill Darnell, has accidentally given the boat its new name. BILL DARNELL: At the end of the meetings, Irving would always say "Peace" and flash the peace sign, and I said, "We should make that a green peace." MOORE: By putting those two things together, Bill symbolized the union of the peace movement with the environmental movement, and that was a new idea. That is, in a way, what gave Greenpeace its power from the start. HUNTER: It has been no easy task to find someone willing to sail out to the Bering Sea as winter approaches and park their vessel, uninsured, next to a nuclear explosion. But chance has led us to John Cormack. -You go do it. Don't work too hard. -Yeah, okay. We'll get into action. 'Cause I know this guy's ready to go. Should I take my hat off and my glasses off and smile for you? (ALL LAUGHING) MOORE: John did it for money, and he had that sense of adventure. Yeah, we're going to check into that. MOORE: He had the nickname "Hard Luck" Cormack and his boat was in some disrepair. I just looked at it and said, "Bob, we are all gonna die." JOHN CORMACK: It is really rolling. Some of the boys are still pretty sick. HUNTER: Apart from Captain Cormack, between us we have almost no practical experience of the sea. Gravity drags our stomachs into pulpy collision with our lungs, the cold, gray boil of the waves wagging over our heads. This trip is going to be at least 100 times as heavy as I thought. MAN: (OVER RADIO) This little 99-ton halibut boat has stayed on her keel so far, but the fall and winter storms up here are fantastic. Winds of 120 miles an hour are not unusual. Last night... ROD MARINING: We realized that we can send a 20-second voice clip from the ship over the telephone system and it'll appear on the radio in Australia, New Zealand and other places. That verified that this was a real global story. HUNTER: Back on land, Rod Marining, the self-styled non-leader of the Northern Lunatic Fringe of Yippie, stokes the fires of public opinion. (CHUCKLES) Hey, you know what it's all about? It's putting on a good show. (CROWD CHANTING) REPORTER: People in Alaska, down the Pacific Coast, Canada and Japan have protested. The people fear earthquakes, damage to wildlife... MOORE: The theory of electronic communication was just being developed at that time. You know, the fax hadn't been invented yet. Bob coined the term "mind bomb" for what today we would call "going viral," where an idea gets into the electronic media and just spreads like ripples on the water instantly. HUNTER: Image is everything. The boat is an icon, a mind bomb sailing across an electronic sea into the front rooms of the masses. CROWD: (CHANTING) Trash Nixon, not Amchitka! Trash Nixon, not Amchitka! DARNELL: Ten thousand students showed up in downtown Vancouver in front of the American consulate. You know, for us on the boat, that was really a huge lift. That gave us a real sense of accomplishment. CROWD: (CHANTING) Power to the people! Power to the people! REPORTER: The Nixon administration said today that the five-megaton nuclear explosion planned for Amchitka Island in the Aleutians will not be set off before October 27th. It wouldn't say just when it will take place and the President is still making up his mind on that. HUNTER: Like a see-saw, the battle swings back and forth. But it is possible that the test has been delayed just to shake us off. We knew we shouldn't just take off and go to Amchitka and be there a month early in what could be terrible hurricane weather. So John decided that we would go into Akutan Harbor. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) HUNTER: Reaching Akutan is a relief, an Alaskan fishing village with a small Aleut community and an abandoned whaling station. MOORE: John told us we weren't supposed to go ashore, but we went ashore. (WHALE BELLOWING) HUNTER: In the remains of the whaling station, huge bones thrust out of the moss like thickets. We are intent on trying to prevent a nuclear holocaust, but for this other race of giant creatures, the holocaust has already come. As though we've been given a glimpse of our own future. MOORE: We walk up into the hills where it's kind of rocky and otherworldly. I think a few people were a bit on the psychedelic side. We all sort of lay face down in this moss and immersed ourself in nature, and we started to talk. HUNTER: As Dr. Patrick gives us the ultimate lecture in ecology, in a leaping flash we all connect with the idea that all life is interwoven. The whales, the moss, us. We are all one. A flower is your brother. DARNELL: And we just sort of felt our power, or that we were doing this as a team of men, warriors. MOORE: There on Akutan Island, we bonded in a way that I'd never really experienced before. The next day, though, there in the distance was a US Coast Guard ship steaming straight for us. DARNELL: The US Navy was monitoring our voyage. This commander gets out and says, "Where's your captain?" And he goes up and talks to John Cormack. MAN: District Director of Customs asked Coast Guard to notify the master of Phyllis Cormack that he has incurred penalty with US Customs for failure to report on the Tariff Act of 1930. DARNELL: We were all subject to fines because we hadn't cleared customs. We entered the US illegally. MOORE: As the captain was up reading the riot act to John, the three crew members in the boat handed up to us this crumpled-up piece of paper. -Listen, you guys. -From the crew. "Due to the situation we are in, "we, the crew of the Confidence, feel that what you are doing "is for the good of all mankind. "If our hands weren't tied by these military bonds, "we would be in the same position you are in, if it were at all possible. "Good luck. We are behind you 100%." -Jesus. -Hey, that's really great, you guys. We've not even started out and they've heard about it, man. It's far out. I dig it, man. (CHUCKLES) MOORE: It just completely blew our minds. -Wow. -(CHUCKLES) MOORE: Signed by 16 members of the crew, I think everybody except the captain. MAN: "If vessel does not make formal entry to customs "before he departs Akutan he will be in violation..." DARNELL: Up in the wheelhouse, the commander told us that we had to go back to US customs, which wasn't any further out the Aleutian chain towards Amchitka, it was the opposite direction. And, uh, they had us. The Coast Guard says it has disciplined an officer and 17 enlisted men for supporting a protest against the planned nuclear test on Amchitka Island in the Aleutians. The men were all on the cutter Confidence when its skipper boarded the Canadian yacht, the Greenpeace, which was sailing in the Aleutians to protest the big test. HUNTER: We retreat to clear customs at Sand Point. The battle isn't lost, but Amchitka is now 1,000 miles away and slipping out of reach. And in the Bering Sea, ice packs are congealing and winter is on the wind. MAN: I wouldn't sail across the Gulf of Georgia in that boat. You guys are crazy. Don't let 'em bullshit you, now. MOORE: We could have gone back out into international waters and headed straight for Amchitka. We're liable to die if we do that. Even huge steel boats get broken in half up there in the winter in the Bering Sea. IRVING STOWE: You are, Ben... BEN METCALFE: I'm just trying to clarify. DARNELL: Ben Metcalfe was arguing we'd accomplished our purpose. We'd got it into the mainstream media. Trudeau was calling Nixon. But Bob really wanted to go on, and I was in that same camp. MAN: Here's another case in point that's coming up right now. I am sick and goddamn-well tired of this fight that's going on between you and you. I think Bob would have gone off the boat, got on the island, run directly for ground zero and gone down the hole to where the bomb was if he could have. He wasn't afraid at all of anything, Bob. He was fearless. MAN: This has gone on just too far. There's too many snide remarks and backhand statements in the whole business and I just don't like it one goddamn bit. DARNELL: Bob lived his ideas. If we're gonna change the world, are we gonna risk something? If it's at all possible, let's do it. After seven days of arguing and not being able to come to any kind of a consensus, Bob just pinned this piece of paper on his undershirt one day that just said, "Fuck off," you know, like, "Don't talk to me," you know, "I've had it. I'm done." We all were, and I think that's kind of when Jim Bohlen stepped in and said, "Look, we're going back." MOORE: Bob felt abject failure. He was angry, he was sad, he was beside himself that we weren't continuing. It broke his heart. HUNTER: It's sickening for me to realize that a revolution can go no faster or further than people themselves. We're supposedly saving the world through our moral example, but in reality we've spent most of our time at each other's throats, egos clashing, turning resistance into psychodrama. DARNELL: When we were almost back to Vancouver, they announced November 4th was the day for the bomb. REPORTER: This afternoon, on hearing that the Atomic Energy Commission will proceed with the Amchitka test, crew members said that President Nixon has clearly circumvented all legal procedure in sanctioning the blast. HUNTER: On Amchitka, the last workers are hustled away from the test site into a concrete bunker 20 miles away. And the chair of the Atomic Energy Commission plans a family picnic. I will be on the island during the test. I did bring along two of the girls and my wife, and I think that that should indicate the high degree of confidence that we have in the safety of that test. REPORTER: As a neighbor to a person who is doing something potentially dangerous, I might call the cops. Uh, yes, but there are no cops to call. MAN: Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one, zero. (RUMBLING) (WIND HOWLING) (HUMMING AND BEEPING) REPORTER: And that was it. Seven minutes and three seconds after Cannikin was detonated on Amchitka, the first readout in Vancouver. The seismic readings translated into an earthquake registering 7.0 on the Richter scale. DARNELL: We all came home feeling like we'd failed. But we sort of were treated like heroes, which was a little bit disconcerting, like, "No, no, we didn't actually... You got the wrong guys," you know? (CROWD APPLAUDING) Many of the Coast Guard people we talked to, apart from the officers, uh, were completely on our side. -Were they? -Oh, yeah. HUNTER: As it turns out, my post-trip despair is utterly mistaken. The political pressure generated by our voyage succeeds beyond anybody's wildest dreams. Five months later, the nuclear testing program at Amchitka is quietly canceled. In the next year and a half, they'll clean up most of this debris. After that, Amchitka will become what it once was, a wildlife refuge, and deep down beneath it, a cavern full of trapped radiation that will endure for perhaps 20,000 years. WEYLER: There was definitely an unfinished feeling after Amchitka. It was gnawing away at the back of our minds that humanity could do tremendous harm to this world even without war. HUNTER: The name on the sail of our little boat has earned some media capital. And I suggest we reinvent ourselves as the Greenpeace Foundation. Bob felt that there needed to be an ecology movement on the same scale as the civil rights movement, the women's movement, the peace movement. MYRON MACDONALD: How do you take hold of the global mind, as it were? Because the globe in the '70s was not thinking globally at all. It was a question of where do you start with such a huge number of problems? Where do you start? I think it only slowly dawned on Hunter that he probably should be giving direction here. WEYLER: He was struggling with the question of whether he was still a journalist writing about this movement or whether he was an activist leading this movement. And then, of course, Paul Spong came along. HUNTER: Paul Spong is a young psychologist who landed a job studying a whale named Skana at the Vancouver Aquarium. He's just been fired for stating publicly that the whale wants to be free, which has made him a bit of a legend among eco-freaks. Are you sure about that? REPORTER: This is a kind of a surprise to the people of Vancouver and district. We didn't know that we were going to get a whale and all of a sudden we have one. PAUL SPONG: I devised an experiment to try to understand what her vision was like. (WHIRRING) Once she got it, she was very, very consistent. She would perform at 90% or above day after day after day. And then, on one day, from one trial to the next, she reversed her behavior. She kept on doing it, but she always got the answer wrong. Kind of ruined my experiment. MOORE: Paul knew the whale was playing with him, that now he was the subject and the whale was doing its research on him. SPONG: It was really the first time that I started to think about, "Who is this whale?" (CLANGING) Dr. Spong, you are at the moment protesting the, uh, captivity of Skana the whale in its present environment. It's very dark and grimy. Plain concrete walls. Nothing from the ocean in it. (CLANGS) Not a seashell in it. Not a seashell. REPORTER: During the last 50 years, it has been estimated that two million whales have been slaughtered. An 80-foot whale weighing 100 tons can be converted into easily replaceable ingredients for industrial lubricants, margarine, cat food and cosmetics. MOORE: Paul learned about what was going on in the whale world outside. He wanted to do something about it, so he came to us. SPONG: I was actually aware of Bob, listening to the stories about the Amchitka voyage. This method of direct, non-violent confrontation was a method that actually could succeed in making change. I invited Bob to come down and visit Skana. At one point, she opened her jaws wide with a clear invitation to him to put his head inside. And he did that. HUNTER: She takes my whole head in her jaws and holds me like a crystal goblet in a vice. I can feel her teeth making the slightest indentation at the back of my neck. Terror explodes in my chest. She could snap my head like an eggshell, but chooses not to. Suddenly I get it. She's shown me exactly where my courage ends and my fear begins. Then, as though satisfied, she lets go and sinks away. WEYLER: I think everything that he was struggling with coalesced and he realized at that moment what he had to do. HUNTER: This is my farewell column. I've quit the Vancouver Sun. -(TYPEWRITER CLACKING) -Not in anger. Not under pressure. Not for any good reason except that to me it seems clear that the time has come to commit myself fully to what has loosely been called "the environmental movement." I've cut my hair, trimmed my beard, and somewhere along the line, I lost my headband. There used to be four-and-a-half million whales on this planet. What we've done is we've removed 90% of the whales already, but there are already about five species they're not allowed to hunt any longer because they have reached a point called commercial extinction. If there is intelligent life on this planet, it ain't necessarily us. DARNELL: I remember being at a meeting and supporting the efforts to stop the French testing in the atmosphere. MACDONALD: Everybody's very earnest and intense, and then Hunter said, "Well, here's what we're gonna do." "We're gonna save the whales." (CHUCKLES) I thought he was just nuts. Saving whales? Whales? I was not in favor. What has that got to do with anything? It horrified the rest of the group. DARNELL: I didn't see it. I didn't think I wanted to go in that direction with it. And that's kind of a regret for me. It's one of the things about Bob Hunter was he was, uh, spontaneous enough to recognize the power and the integrity of a new idea and go with it. Bob always recognized that you can change the world through a camera much easier than with a gun and much more effectively. MACDONALD: The concept was complete from the outset. We have to get between the whales and the harpooner. That's the image we have to get. It was completely premeditated. WATSON: Well, I thought it was a great idea and that we could probably intercept them using Zodiacs, which I was familiar with because I was in the Coast Guard. Everybody else worried about the risk, but I figured, you know, that was the whole point of it. Harpooning a whale is not really a story, but people risking their lives to protect the lives of a whale, that's a story. HUNTER: The announcement that Greenpeace intends to rescue the last of the great whales has released a frightening energy. Some kind of psychic tom-tom is at work in the jungles of the collective unconscious and it's brought people in droves. You wanna grab hold of the line and take it up the mast? Sure, yeah, where is it? HUNTER: My newfound love, Bobbi, becomes the driving energy that fuses the parts of this kaleidoscope together. BOBBI HUNTER: It was a magic time. We needed money and the money would happen. We needed people, the right person would come along. I took over the treasury, and the treasury, at that time, consisted of a little tiny lockbox with about $50 in it and a couple of receipts. (CHUCKLES) And we moved from there. HUNTER: We have a fine, if unconventional, blend of human talents. For every mystic, we have at least one mechanic. BOBBI: It wasn't really a lot of people, but, boy, did we do a lot of things. Day and night, we would be making lists of hundreds of things that we had to do. We really had fun with each other. We laughed, and joked, and pushed and pulled to the point that we had a whole other language going on amongst ourselves. Why don't I let you just talk to Walrus? Here he is. Just hold down that button. HUNTER: Walrus is an archaeology graduate who looks like a frontier cowboy. Hi, Walrus. I mean, hello, Rod. (CHUCKLES) WALRUS: Paul Watson called me and said, "Hey, Walrus, come on out here. "We're gonna set this whale thing up." I thought, "Well, you need a cook? I'll just take that on." HUNTER: No one ever has found out why he's changed his name from David Garrick to Walrus Oakenbough. WALRUS: As I was exploring the topic of magic mushrooms and different psychedelic plants, I didn't wanna use my real name, uh, just for logistical purposes. -MAN: Ron Precious, take three. -(CLEARS THROAT) HUNTER: When we hoped for a film crew, cameraman Ron Precious arrived with 20,000 feet of Kodachrome. RON PRECIOUS: The crew welcomed me as the cameraman, and, um, Fred Easton was my soundman as well as the second camera. We were all there for the same reason, to get powerful iconic images that would, uh, you know, resonate with everyone. HUNTER: And when we wanted another Zodiac inflatable, Carlie Trueman turned up with one of her own. Twenty-three years old and an experienced scuba diver. Definitely more a mechanic than a mystic. Absolutely true. (CHUCKLES) I mean, this was a motley group of people if there ever was one. I looked at them all and I thought, "What the hell am I getting involved with?" -PRECIOUS: Can you turn a little bit? -Turn a little bit? Yeah, like that, like it's a fashion. HUNTER: A mad costume designer has wrought a uniform for me out of green and navy blue corduroy, with huge pirate-style cuffs featuring enough officer's stripes to rank me as the commander of some psychedelic NATO. Hang on a sec, hang on a sec. (CHUCKLES) But the idea of leading anything troubles me. I've always hated leaders. My father deserted my mother when I was still young and it's close to nauseating to realize I've become group father myself. (CHUCKLES) WEYLER: He wasn't an organizational man, but Bob embodied what I think of as real, true leadership. He was visionary. He could look into the future and imagine things that didn't yet exist and he could inspire and empower people to contribute. Groovy, man. (CHUCKLES) WEYLER: This was a glorious revolution. This just wasn't about us going out and saving whales. We were talking about a new way of being in the world. One of the languages we're learning to speak here is whale. That's whale language. HUNTER: Creatures of light, monsters of the deep, aquatic acrobats. The biggest brains on the planet. Is there any way we can bridge this species gap and actually communicate with the whale? We believed that music was the way to communicate with them. WILL JACKSON: I was at work one day in San Francisco, having lunch, reading about Watergate. My co-worker turned on the radio and it was a talk show, but the voices were not human, they were whales. So I fired off a letter. All of a sudden I got this letter from Bob Hunter. "Your letter arrived just in time. It's a miracle. "We needed a synthesizer player and there you were." WEYLER: Now, everybody's got a synthesizer these days, but in those days, in 1975, I'd never seen anything like this, and Will could make these unworldly sounds. (ELECTRONIC BEEPING) JACKSON: John aggressively wanted to get rid of me as soon as he could. I'd never been on a boat. I wasn't a sailor. I didn't know how to do lines or anything. You know, boat lines. (LAUGHS) MAN: Is there anybody there who's into getting that Greenpeace flag? HUNTER: We grope towards mastery of the skills we need for the voyage. Yeah, we should have mics on it. -This is theater. -Pardon me, this is reality. HUNTER: Learning to handle the Zodiacs, we are transformed from flower children into a sea-going gang of ecological bikers. We have psyched ourselves into a sense of simmering, sparkling power. HUNTER: The plan is to put these in the water and run along with the chaser boat when it's actually hunting a whale so they can't get a shot at it. INTERVIEWER: Expecting any violence on the part of the whalers? Um, we've been wondering about that all winter. (CHEERING) REPORTER: On April 27th, the 80-foot ocean-going trawler Phyllis Cormack set sail from Vancouver, British Columbia, on a twofold mission. Number one, search out and document Russian whaling operations in the North Pacific... WEYLER: By the time we got on the boat, we were stunned, ourselves. MACDONALD: There were thousands of people there. Thousands. WEYLER: That great feeling when everything has finally come to fruition and the show is on. But then, here we are taking off into the middle of the Pacific Ocean and we have no idea how to find the whalers. We have no idea how long it's gonna take us or where we're actually even going. So, then there was that. One, two, three, four. Two thousand. Makes it about 2,500 miles to the Hawaiian Islands from here. Does that sound about right? Anybody know how far Hawaii is? SPONG: We had some vague ideas about where the whaling fleet was, but we didn't know. We did know that there was a lot of information about where whales were killed in the Bureau of International Whaling Statistics in Norway in a town called Sandefjord. MOORE: Paul managed to talk his way in there as a scientist. He was a scientist, but he didn't mention the part about Greenpeace. SPONG: I had told the director I'd wanted to find out where we might do research with sperm whales. I spent several hours there looking through stacks of logbooks piled row after row after row. And in the end, um, he got his secretary to help. MOORE: Paul's espionage gave us the positions of the Soviet factory whaling fleets going back 10 or 15 years, and there they were every year at the same place off California. It's this area here, which had the most whales in it. That's in June, July and August. HUNTER: The timing of the Russian hunt happens to coincide with the annual meeting of the International Whaling Commission, which determines how many whales can be killed worldwide. MOORE: It has as many whales in that one little area taken as there is in a combination of the whole works around the island, you know. HUNTER: If we confront the whalers in that five-day window at the end of June, our mind bomb will have the maximum effect. So we just should be out somewhere around in there as much as possible in June. WEYLER: The problem was that it was early April and we had all of May and half of June to keep the story alive. It's not an old kind of battle. It's a new kind of battle. You know, by going out there and concentrating people's attention through the media and communications systems, in a way, what you do is you bring everybody onto the boat. You know, in a rough calculation, I'd say there's probably about 14 million people on this boat at the moment. JACKSON: Bob looked at our little world as kind of making a movie. We were creating the storyline. He had an arc. He knew where it needed to go. We were like characters. What do we need to do and who can best fill the role? Great movie, yeah. (LAUGHS) There was the front, the screen of the movie, what you saw, and then there was the back, what was behind it all. The hidden reality of what was actually going on. You're not taking anything now, are you? -MAN: No. -No. Don't waste your film. PRECIOUS: I wouldn't say Bob was directing us, but he was certainly aware of what things were cinematic or filmworthy. Truth, 24 frames per second. JACKSON: He liked to exaggerate the extreme to make us appear as the unwitting fools, so that the people with real power would not take us seriously. We were like the Trojan horse. Really it was all a design to achieve the ending he was after. But heroes often fail. WEYLER: May had come and gone. It's now June. We headed to the Mendocino Ridge to look for them. HUNTER: There's just a big gray ocean around here and some gray clouds and a lot of birds, but we haven't seen any whales yet. WEYLER: The days were ticking off, but the Mendocino Ridge is a long stretch of ocean. HUNTER: Well, what do you think? I think we chased 'em off the whaling grounds. Well, I'd like to know what we've done. (CHUCKLES) I don't know. Have we got a positive identification on it? No. Except that we know that they're in this area, so... I don't know. Why don't we go back to where we were last night... -MAN: Yeah. -...and try again? HUNTER: Hello. Can you hear me? Over. MAN: (OVER RADIO) Am I getting through to you, Bob? Just talk to us. Over. (CLATTERING) Negative. Why doesn't he just tell me the goddamn... MARINING: The ship was floundering at sea, we had no money, some of the rice was full of diesel and people, uh, were hungry onboard the boat. I don't understand, Rod. It was like finding a needle in a haystack. -George. -Yeah? There's some Russians caught talking here. Can you eavesdrop? (RADIO STATIC) HUNTER: The radio crackles with ghostly Russian voices, which seem to come from everywhere at once. (RUSSIAN VOICES OVER RADIO) HUNTER: Our Czechoslovakian engineer, George Korotva, tries to get a fix on their position. Well, they must be down there at least 150, 200 miles. (INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER) GEORGE KOROTVA: We sat on that radio for hours and hours and hours, and so you get the idea... They are there somewhere. Cormack said to Hunter, "We have two days of fuel left." (INDISTINCT CONVERSATION) CARLIE TRUEMAN: The question was, were we gonna run for San Francisco without an encounter with the whalers, or were we gonna stay out and try and find them? And, of course, that has huge consequences for Cormack. If he has to have a tow, I mean, this is big bucks that we're talking for John. Hunter, Pat Moore and David Garrick come by and they have got The I Ching, and they have got the coins, the three coins. I have no idea what The I Ching is. I've never heard of this book. I've never seen it. But, of course, it's a book of divination, right? The Chinese word which means "approach" has a range of meanings. TRUEMAN: I thought, "I have joined a ship of fools." The ancient explanations in the Book of Changes give as its first meaning "becoming great." TRUEMAN: Hunter throws one that says, "Success. It furthers one to cross the great waters." There are four hexagrams out of the 64 that have that, and it just means good fortune, supreme good fortune. He's thrilled. He thinks that we should go and keep chasing whales, right? Pat Moore threw it and he gets a second one of the four hexagrams. David throws it and he gets a third one. I'm saying, "What the hell are you guys doing? "What, you're... You're gonna consult some kind of oracle for this decision?" And they said, "You throw them." And I went, "Oh, yeah, right. "You guys, this is BS." And I threw them and I got the fourth one. And we went out and the next day, we found the Russians. (WHOOPING) Vostok is just over five miles ahead of us. -MAN: Yeah. -(HUNTER SPEAKING ON RADIO) -MAN 2: Rex, count those boats again. -What? -Count those... -There's nine. One, two, three, four, five over there. There's one by the Vostok and there's three over here. There's nine chasers altogether. MAN: Yeah, well, Bob, what's the plan? Problem is, a boat that size can do about 20 knots. We can only do 10, so they're starting to pull away. So we'll put the Zodiacs out and run over and have a damn good look at it, see whether they're our boys or not. And if they are, we'll try to hang in with them as long as we can. MAN: I think we'd better hurry. They're way up on the horizon. Yeah. She does 15, the Zodiac does 20, and he's five miles ahead already, and the crew aren't out on deck and the Zodiacs... -MAN: They are ready now. -Two miles. HUNTER: John has just, uh, spotted two flags in the water. They're dead ahead of us. I can see it, too. MAN: It's a sperm! HUNTER: It's definitely a sperm. MAN: Yeah, let's get closer to it. HUNTER: Yeah, here, it's definitely a dead whale. Just bleeding all over the place. MAN: That sure doesn't look the right size. -MAN 2: It's too small, Bob. -It's a baby. WEYLER: That's a goddamn baby whale, for Christ's sake. It's only about... How long is that? TRUEMAN: Is that its tail there for sure? MAN: Twenty! It's 20 feet at the most. WEYLER: Twenty feet at the most. MAN: I think we should even measure that one, Bob. MOORE: We thought they were out there killing adult whales. We find out they're basically wiping out the whole pod, kids and all. WEYLER: George, this is a film thing, so let's get a Zodiac and circle around this whale and get some shots. -Yeah, he's getting a... -(INDISTINCT) WALRUS: I think we hadn't quite thought through the mechanistic side of whaling. The fact you could bloat a carcass and stick a radio directional finder onto it and just leave it and come back later. And it was just heart-wrenching. (STAMMERS) It brings tears right now. That little whale. WALRUS: Okay, that's good. Get in there before some sharks show up or something. CORMACK: Watch for sharks! WEYLER: Stand up, Paul! WATSON: I was very much, uh, appalled by what I saw. Here we are out here, they're killing these beautifully intelligent, socially complex, sentient beings, uh, and for what? I actually got onto the whale to measure it. And I found it was illegally taken. It was an undersized whale. WEYLER: What do you say, Paul? How long do you think it is? -What? -How long? About 18 feet. WATSON: That was certainly a turning point in my life. Just how warm the body was, how hot the blood was that was coming out of the wound. The whale's eye was open and it just struck me in a flash that we're insane, ecologically insane. From that moment on, I never looked upon myself anymore as working for people but more working for whales and other creatures that live in the oceans. HUNTER: June 27th, one mile from the Vostok, closing in. The Russian boats are all in motion, I think with the Vostok at the center. And everybody is in their wetsuits. We've worked out who's gonna be in what Zodiacs. Uh, we're just, uh, heading alongside it now. We're gonna circle around behind on the other side. That chaser boat is tucking in right behind it. Blood pouring out. Hell of a mess. Just a hell of a mess. There's a whole crowd on the stern of the Vostok. MAN: Fucking pigs! HUNTER: Hey, listen, now, no... Let's not get into overt aggression with them. -MAN: I just said... -Look at that fucking thing move. MOORE: The guys up on top are all in uniforms with Russian hats. What do you call those hats, George? -Papakha. -Papakha? Papakha. TRUEMAN: The Dalniy Vostok is literally a slaughterhouse on water. It was highly mechanized killing. This was a factory. And that was when it got very, very, very real. -FRED EASTON: Okay, Zodiac launching crew. -Zodiac launching crew! GEORGE: Anybody got a hand on that rope? -Come on. Quick, quick, quick, quick. -Okay. TRUEMAN: And there they go, folks! They're off! MAN: They're off! TRUEMAN: Whoop, whoop! WEYLER: The idea had been that Fred Easton would film with his Bolex 16mm and I would take photographs from a distance from the side, so we could get the whaling ship and the protestors in the shot. TRUEMAN: I climb to the crosstrees and I sit with a pair of binoculars on the spreader bars and I keep track of where all the boats are. JACKSON: When Hunter got on the Zodiac, I saw his cassette player sitting there on the hatch cover. I just grabbed the thing and I went up the mast and I started reporting the confrontation. JACKSON: There's a large herd of sperm whales off our starboard bow. We're all going that way. The other two backup Zodiacs have been on the bow of the chaser boat and it's been unable to fire on any sperms even though there's plenty of them around here. Sperm whales are blowing hard and fast. Seems they're tired and they can't dive very much at all. WATSON: Every time that the whale moved, we tried to steer the boat in order to block it, and that worked for about 20 minutes or so. JACKSON: The harpoon man appears very frustrated through the binoculars. He doesn't even seem to be at his post. TRUEMAN: The skipper of the kill boat comes down the walkway to the gun deck. These two men argue. He puts up his hands like this and bends to his gun and we know that he's gonna shoot. JACKSON: George Korotva and Bob Hunter are in the Zodiac in front of the chase boat bow by only a distance of about 50 feet, and the film crew Zodiacs are on each side. PRECIOUS: Fred Easton had a problem with his camera. All the bouncing and jostling in the Zodiac had frayed the battery connection, intermittent, going on and off, on and off. Here's the big moment and I didn't even know if this camera was gonna function. GEORGE KOROTVA: We start going zigzag, zigzag. Occasionally, I'd glance back and I'd see he was following back and forth. WATSON: The harpooner then looked at us, and then the captain looked at us and he smiled, then went like this across his throat and I always joked that, you know, the reason we were in that position is because we had read a lot of Gandhi at the time, and it suddenly occurred to us that Gandhi wasn't going to work for us anymore. JACKSON: They just shot the harpoon. I don't know if they hit. I don't see any blood. They're coming around to port slowly. They've cut their engines. Sound of that harpoon was frightening. It was like a giant cannon. He had a clear shot right over the Zodiac to the whale, and it went over Hunter's head, maybe 15 feet. I turned around and then I saw... Psst! The cable snapped. I peel off and get the hell out of there. JACKSON: George is calling in the other Zodiacs. There's steam rising from the blood. There's still blow. The whale's not dead yet. It's still blowing, but it's not going anywhere. WEYLER: They'll shoot a female whale and then when the bull whale comes to help the female, they'll shoot the bull whale. JACKSON: Hunter's yelling at all the Zodiacs to come in immediately. There's a bull over there that's mad as hell, freaking out. (SHOUTING) MAN: There's the other one, over there. (SHIP HORN BLOWING) MOORE: Did you get that, Ron? HUNTER: Thoroughly shaken, we haul ourselves back on deck on a wave of revulsion, rage and exultation. We count eight surviving whales in the pod fleeing steadily to the horizon. A few hours later, the last Russian vessel disappears from our radar, heading in the opposite direction. CORMACK: You got it on tape? HUNTER: No, unfortunately, I didn't bring my tape recorder. CORMACK: Are you stupid? How dumb can you be? JACKSON: We're back on board going over what had just happened. Hunter was asking, "Did you get it? Did you get the shot?" PRECIOUS: Do we have that big moment when the harpoon shot fired? With film, that's the problem, you don't know until you've developed the film whether, in fact, you've caught... You've captured the image. HUNTER: New paragraph. "Riding upward on a wave, "we found the harpoon gun aimed directly at us." -Period. -MAN: (OVER RADIO) Okay. New sentence. "As we fell with the wave," comma, "we heard a deafening bang." Okay. WEYLER: Bob's talking to our friends in San Francisco saying, "Make sure you tell the media that we're coming in." And our friend in San Francisco just laughed. He says, "Don't worry about that. Everybody knows about it. "Everybody's talking about it. Everybody will be there." REPORTER: The 80-foot ecology ship Phyllis Cormack steamed into San Francisco Bay today after its weekend encounter with nine Russian whaling vessels. -The ship is... -(REPORTERS CLAMORING) REPORTER: Could you explain the incident when the Russians fired the harpoon over your head? MOORE: Chaser came up behind us, they were 500 feet behind us, right dead on our stern going much faster than we were. MOORE: We were mobbed by the media. REPORTER: What have American authorities said about your chasing these Russian whalers? JACKSON: We've had no response from the authorities. Suddenly we became celebrities. It could become an international incident. I think it has become an international incident already. PRECIOUS: Both Fred and I are immediately escorted to CBS station's headquarters to have the footage developed. We start hand-winding the film through a Moviscop. It's about a four-inch screen. Fred pans the camera to the right, he comes upon a Zodiac, pans a little further to the right and there are the whales. And as he panned back, the harpoon entered the frame. WEYLER: We got the shot. Fred got the shot. And that was the moment that launched the modern environmental movement. A Canadian ecology organization claims a boat it operates chased a nine-ship Russian whaling fleet for 250 miles off the California coast this weekend in order to save the whale. REPORTER: A lot of ecologists are worried about whales, and one group has gone to war with the Russians. Thirteen people in an 80-foot boat have taken on a whole Russian whaling fleet in the Pacific Ocean. "And God created great whales." From that rolling passage in the Book of Genesis right down to the present day, the world's largest mammal has created awe, terror and reverence. REPORTER: Members of the Cormack's crew sailed a small rubber boat into the path of a Russian whaler. REPORTER 2: The Greenpeace managed to save eight whales by using this tactic, but finally, the Russian harpooner, whale in his sights, fired, the harpoon flashing only 15 feet above the heads of the Greenpeace crew, and moments later a dying whale thrashes in the water. We had really expected that they would not shoot if there were human beings in the way, and they did. MACDONALD: He'd actualized a dream. If you don't think of these things, nothing's gonna happen. To think of it, go out and do it, that's remarkable. REPORTER: In the meantime, evidence obtained during this last mission will be submitted to the International Whaling Commission and the United Nations with a plea that something be done to curb the wholesale slaughter of the world's largest mammal. WALRUS: What Bob said we could do, we did, and now we're looking at it and he's all, "Ooh, boy. (CHUCKLES) This is something." WEYLER: That footage proved out the mind bomb theory, that you could do a dramatic action and actually connect viscerally with people in their own minds. WALRUS: That galvanized the United States. It really did. Suddenly, the whole place just became whale-conscious. And pretty soon we had volunteers. They wanted to set up Greenpeace offices all the way down the coast. It really was on a trajectory skyward. REPORTER: No. No. No, it has to be on record. HUNTER: You can get fucked up pretty fast if you start thinking the money's the deal. REPORTER: All right, but... REPORTER: We're running? Okay. Uh... Bob, it seems like just a few days ago, for me at least, that I was talking with you at Jericho and you were headed out to sea. What does it seem... Seem like to you? Well, it was either two hours ago or 10,000 years. (CHUCKLES) WEYLER: I think not only did the moment of confronting the whalers change the world in the sense that it helped launch, uh, an environmental movement, it changed all of us individually and it changed the organization. Fear success because success can poison the essence of what it was you were trying to do. (CHEERING AND APPLAUDING) HUNTER: By the time we get back to Vancouver, our lives have irrevocably changed without us realizing. The North Pacific odyssey cost over $120,000, three times the original estimates, but as one crewman told me, "As long as they're butchering whales, Greenpeace won't rest." Everything worked out well, um, almost as though we were charmed. WEYLER: The weakest link was always going to be ourselves, the threat of our own egos getting in the way of what we were trying to do, our personal relationships with each other. And I think if you look at the history of social change movements, that's always the weakest link. ♪ Why can't we live in harmony ♪ We make love... ♪ HUNTER: Despite global fame, our little group is now $40,000 in debt. Our bank tells us that we have to learn the arcane arts of cash flow and bookkeeping, which we know nothing about. I really don't have much to say, um, thank goodness. (CHUCKLES) HUNTER: The chief advocate of fiscal responsibility is one of the worst flipped-out mystics of all, namely, myself. And we're gonna try and save them all by next year. -There's no reason why we can't. -(CHEERING) JACKSON: Hunter would refer often to a question he asked of Allen Ginsberg once, "How do you deal with power?" And Ginsberg advised him, "Let go of it before it freezes in your hands." HUNTER: We've got offices being set up in about 20 different places, ranging from France, through the United States. Uh, there's one being set up in Japan. So that it's a... It's a growth situation. -Well, still coming in? -Oh, yes, Bob, very well. WEYLER: Bob said, "Let 1,000 Greenpeace offices blossom. Why not?" BOBBI: It was just like Johnny Appleseed. There'd be a little bit of Greenpeace here and a little bit of Greenpeace there. "Do it. Just set up and we'll stay in touch and we'll make a movement." HUNTER: When there are visions involved and dreams, and ideals, and ethics and changed values, that all basically implies a revolution, and when you get down to it, that's what we're talking about. MOORE: Bob thought it was fine for Greenpeace groups to just start up all over the world without any control and basically to take our name, and our deeds and exploits, and raise money themselves and not have to give any to us. WEYLER: We didn't own the environmental movement. Our goal was not to start an organization and make the organization famous. Our goal was to make ecology famous, make nature famous, make whales and seals famous. That's what we wanted to do. REPORTER: Money is raised by any means possible. Sales of T-shirts, bumper stickers, buttons and lottery tickets, walkathons, cyclathons, swimathons, telethons, and Greenpeace memberships, $10 for an individual. TRUEMAN: As soon as you had different cities saying, "We're leaping on this bandwagon and we're calling ourselves Greenpeace," at that point there is a necessity for some kind of organizational structure. And the people that organize structures like that are not the same kind of people that say, "Oh, I don't know. "Let's just put a little boat in front of a whaler and take a picture of it." They think completely differently. HUNTER: The winter is full of ambition. We're already planning the next whale voyage when Walrus and Paul have an idea to interfere with the annual Newfoundland seal hunt. REPORTER: Paul Watson, freelance writer, ex-sailor, a long-time dedicated member of the Greenpeace Foundation. He and his companions are in bizarre rehearsal for their next grand adventure. It's the blackest mark on the whole Canadian national identity. I mean, people all over the world know about Canada's seal slaughter. We just didn't have the resources and people and energy to do two major campaigns. WATSON: Bob and everybody said, "Well, we haven't got the funding for that." I said, "Well, that's okay, I've raised some money independently, so..." Then they sort of reluctantly let me go ahead with it. WATSON: We'll be applying some dye to the coats of the seals. They kill the baby seals because they want the white fur. They won't be getting white fur. They'll be getting green and white fur. One of the problems was that this was Paul's idea and he was happy to create a confrontation. (ROCK MUSIC PLAYING) WALRUS: Paul wanted Hunter to come along. But he didn't want Patrick to come along. Bob brought Patrick. WEYLER: Pat Moore and Paul Watson clashed and they clashed continuously. Well, I didn't take to Pat Moore at all. I thought he was a bit of a pompous ass, really, you know. He had his private school education and looked down on everybody else who didn't have that background. Paul is a bit of a know-it-all. That's... To me, that's a problem. WALRUS: It was not good for everybody. (STAMMERING) It just began a downward spiral in relations between those two. REPORTER: The battle lines are drawn again between conservationists and Canadian government officials. MOORE: Up till then we'd been perceived as the little David going out against the vast Russian whaling fleet or against nuclear tests, but now we were coming after the little Newfoundland seal hunters. MARINING: This was a new situation for us and for Canada because we're attacking our own culture. The more coverage we got, the more political it became. (STAMMERING) It was gonna be a battle like we'd never experienced before. REPORTER: Local fishermen, many of them out of work, angry that anyone would consider the welfare of seals above their own. HUNTER: Blocking the entrance to Saint Anthony is as mean-looking a gang as any of us has ever seen. WALRUS: They surrounded us and tried to roll us over and all that kind of stuff, unsuccessfully. They had a noose in this pickup truck and they're just pointing at it and us behind a... "We're gonna string you guys up." (LAUGHS) Nice way to enter a Canadian town, eh? (LAUGHS) MAN: The people in New York or the people down... And little old ladies in running shoes will just have their compassionate concern for the seal and not realize that in this part of the world there's a whole way of life that's threatened by... Bob being Bob, he found out who the leaders were and went and tried to make a deal with them. WATSON: The reception we got in Saint Anthony didn't surprise me. I was raised in the Maritimes, so I knew they were gonna be angry. What surprised me was Bob and Pat and others backing down. HUNTER: There are 900 species on the endangered list and Greenpeace is concerned with all of them. But one of the species that's on the endangered list is the Newfoundland fisherman and we're concerned with him, too. PRECIOUS: He's such a convincing speaker, he managed to convince them to allow us to enter the town and then meet that evening in the high school and plead our case, basically. MAN: I'd like to place a resolution before this meeting tonight that these people be given until tomorrow morning to place themselves back on their bus, remove themselves from Saint Anthony and the problems of Newfoundland. I'm 67 years of age and we have suffered our life. It's high time to stop this right now. HUNTER: To rescue our campaign, we must persuade this room to allow us onto the ice floes. There's nothing to be gained from pitting ourselves against the local landsmen when most of the cull is done by commercial Norwegian fleets. As any general knows, if you drive a wedge between your opponents, you are that much closer to winning the battle. SPEAKER: I would like to call upon Mr. Hunter, if he'll respond. Thank you. (BOOING) The reason we're here is not to harass Newfoundlanders and not to try and tell you to change your life and not to take food out of your mouths. We're here primarily because there's a Norwegian fleet operating and they're out there doing something that they did off the coast of Russia over a decade ago, so that finally the Russian landsmen had nothing to hunt any longer. They chased... The Russians chased the Norwegians out at that point, but by that point it was too damn late. MARINING: I think he had a strong sense of empathy and he would flow with the situation. We had a common saying back in those days that, you know, "Let the guru be the situation or the situation is the guru." I have stated that we did not realize that it would interfere with your livelihood. Now that we understand that, we are prepared not to do it. (CHEERING) The deal that he made was that they would hand over the dye. MAN: We take that to be a firm commitment that you definitely will not use the paint or that you are gonna look further into it. No, you can take that as firm commitment that we will not use it and we'll bring the dye down to Roy tomorrow. (CHEERING AND APPLAUDING) WALRUS: Bob unilaterally decided to give it up, and Paul and I weren't gonna give it up. But he announced it to everybody that we would give it up, so that... That was not a good thing to do. JOHN CRAVEN: The campaign to save the seals and the rescuers decide not to spray them green. Hello again, and there are new developments in the campaign by animal lovers in Canada to save thousands of young seals from the hunters. The Greenpeacers are coming across lots of problems. Um... Here's the... Here's the dye. Um... We spent months digging that stuff up together, so maybe keep it as a souvenir. (CHUCKLES) HUNTER: To Paul, I've sold out to the sealers and am basically a traitor, but this is the only way I can see to reverse the tide that's moving against us and continue our protest out on the ice. MOORE: You know, in retrospect, I think it was fair to say that Bob was just trying to be strategic. It's politics. Bullshit. You know, if you're going to take a stand, you have to take a stand. And you can't, uh, you can't retreat, you can't back down and you can't compromise. HUNTER: (ON RADIO) The Greenpeace Foundation announced it has every intention of carrying on with its opposition to the hunt. MARINING: Paul, and myself and Walrus were starting to critically look at Bob and say, "Look, you know, "he's not the omnipotent god that we thought he was. "He's... He's got his frailties and we have to counter that." BOBBI: It's so easy for people to be critical, but what that allowed them to do was be out on the seal floes and the campaign was able to carry on. WALRUS: The Canadian government made it illegal for us to keep the helicopters within three nautical miles of any seal on the ice. We had to go at least three miles across ice to get to a seal. On foot, a very dangerous thing to do. (SEAL WHINING) WALRUS: It's a brutal thing to witness. To go after a baby seal and club it and then drag it by the hakapik dug into its brain area, it's gut-wrenching. MAN: Take that off. Take that one off. It's not respectful of the natural world. Sadly, we kept our word. And we didn't have any spare dye to use out there. MOORE: I think we succeeded in getting our message out just as well as we would have if we'd sprayed them with green dye. Bearing witness is a powerful concept. Making it clear that you are... You are watching it happen. WATSON: Oh, bearing witness, I mean... You know, you don't walk down the street and see a woman being raped and stand there and take pictures. Bearing witness, to me, is cowardice. It's non-intervention. I never understood it. We should not be submissive to these people who are destroying the planet. We should be aggressive. We should stand up and stand tall and get in their face. HUNTER: It's a goddamn disgusting mess. And when you're out of jobs, you know, the guys that are making all the money out of this, they'll just go and invest it in real estate and you'll be out of jobs. We're trying to help you too, you know? MAN: It's our living, buddy, they're still taking care of us. HUNTER: Yeah, but you're gonna be out of a living in five years. HUNTER: It's my bright idea to stand in front of the ship that collects the sealskins. MAN: Look out! The boat's moving! HUNTER: I'm in the grip of this insane fantasy that I can hold it back by sheer force of will. I'm blocking the boat. The moment I do, Paul Watson joins me. WATSON: The ice was cracking under our feet and I turned to Bob and I said, "Okay, uh, when the ice breaks, I'll jump this way, you jump that way." And he said, "I ain't moving." And I thought, "Shit, Bob, if you don't move, I can't move." They ran at us a couple of times and they stopped. WALRUS: When you're under fire, you don't have time for debating, you just have to act, and people put aside differences quickly. WATSON: You know, I felt so incapable of doing anything to stop it. We could only do what we did. And, um, you know, we did... We did our best. WATSON: That was a dramatic image. It certainly got a lot of coverage. But Bob had taken away my major tactic and, uh, I just wanted to be free to, uh, handle my campaigns without being interfered with. MARINING: It got bigger and bigger and bigger, and the bigger it got, the harder it was to keep cohesion together. WEYLER: By 1976, we were feeling a tremendous amount of strain and pressure, and in the meantime, we wanted to pull off another whale campaign. Now, with a bigger boat, it was a lot more expensive and we went through a lot more fuel. HUNTER: The Greenpeace 7, a 153-foot minesweeper capable of going all the way to Tokyo, is going to leave from out here. And then when we go out on that boat, everybody goes out on that boat with us, and this is something that they can't stop now 'cause we're not just a bunch of hippies paddling around in a rowboat in English Bay any longer. -(CHUCKLES) -(CHEERING) WEYLER: Suddenly, we found ourselves struggling with competing opinions about how the organization was gonna be pulled together. Okay, we can put it up a little more if you want. WEYLER: People wanting credit, people wanting to be a big shot, or people wanting to be in charge. -Are you holding the end of the rope? -Yes! WOMAN: We don't need that rope. WEYLER: Pat Moore sort of saw himself as somebody who was second-in-command, so to speak. And Paul Watson also saw himself as sort of second-in-command. This is ironic because the last thing Bob wanted to be was first-in-command. Those boats are gonna stay in a position? TRUEMAN: I mean, we could have hired a psychologist to come in and say, "Guess what? You're gonna be fighting each other for a while. "Guess what? You're gonna have hurt feelings." This isn't an individual game and it isn't an ego game. It's a... We do, in fact, represent a powerful force that is trying to hold this planet together. WEYLER: Bob was trying to preserve the tribe, the family spirit of what we had, and he was slowly watching it turn into this kind of Shakespearean tragedy. And so he took to wearing this brush that we used to clean the latrine. And he had assigned himself the role of latrine officer. BOBBI: He would keep it in grand order and he'd proudly walk around, and people were going, "What is with Hunter?" You can still see the Zodiac in front of you, can you? Over. WOMAN: (ON RADIO) I can still see the Zodiac... WEYLER: I mean, it was sort of an internal mind bomb. Bob, in his own way, modeling modesty in the face of this sort of unrelenting ego. I felt like he's given this everything he has. But I think he felt a little bit alone. BOBBI: Because he was so stressed, he was prescribed Valium to calm him down. Kind of a daily combination, Valiums, and nicotine, and alcohol and pot, and so he was making bad decisions. We've got to make some decisions here that I do not want to communicate back to Vancouver. SPONG: I think, at that point, we became a little sidelined to the Cold War, a toy for the CIA. WEYLER: Suddenly, we had somebody inside the United States government feeding us information regarding the position of the Russian whaling fleet and accepting fuel from somebody who has a close association with the US Central Intelligence Agency. Now, of course, they were doing that because they loved the fact that we were harassing the Russians. So suddenly we're seeing all these strange bedfellows. We got a coordinate that had gone all the way to Washington, come back to Vancouver to here. And it is an old Greenpeace slogan that used to appear on the walls, and I know you've heard this 100 times, Bobbi, wherever you are, but, uh, it used to be, "With enemies like this, who needs friends?" WATSON: We couldn't get the coordinates for the Japanese fleet, but we could get the coordinates on the Russian fleet because that was in the interest of the United States government to embarrass the Russians. HUNTER: The whole fleet is apparently now moving west. WEYLER: When that got out, that caused a huge dissension on the crew. WALRUS: You know, I really didn't wanna become a strong-arm for psychological war on behalf of the American government. WEYLER: Paul Watson blamed Pat Moore and Bob Hunter for not being more aggressive in going after the Japanese. So that's... We're adopting a fine, ancient, uh, strategy of hanging loose to the last possible second. WALRUS: We just barely made it to Hawaii and things started breaking apart. Paul left. Paul Watson left the boat. Uh, if you're on standby, that makes things a lot easier... MARINING: Many times I was on his right shoulder and Bobbi was on his left shoulder, because Bob was completely wrecked. And... And... He was moody and he was causing problems. HUNTER: Come on, let's go, guys. Let's go. WEYLER: The new members of the crew kind of rebelled against Bob's authority on the boat. PRECIOUS: I would call it a full-on mutiny. The crew was just saying, "You guys have... "You've lost us completely. "Bob's become a babbling idiot. "We don't have any confidence that you guys are, "are making the right decisions." HUNTER: I brood darkly over my failings as a leader. The greater our influence, the messier and more obstinately human things become, everyone involved being flawed human beings after all. Thank God for the Valium. HUNTER: (OVER LOUDSPEAKER) We speak for the 70 countries that have begged you to stop whaling. There are not many whales left. These whales belong to all the people of the Earth, not just those proud and mighty and successful nations like yours which have the machinery to be able to kill them. They also belong to me, they belong to my children, they belong to the children of Africa, South America, of North America and of Europe... HUNTER: Our confrontations with the Russians succeed because they too have become aware of the power of images. Whenever we appear, they shut their whole operation down. We stayed in front a couple of times they started up and each time they start up, we get back in front of them and they stop and right now they've stopped. Stopped. HUNTER: But to what end? Eventually, we'll have to go home. I've borne witness to the point of nausea, yet nothing in the world has really changed. Maybe we should buy some explosives and sink the bastards. (ROCK MUSIC PLAYING) WATSON: On the second seal hunt, I didn't invite Bob or Pat on the campaign. Since Bob had interfered the year before, I didn't want him interfering again. (APPLAUSE) BOBBI: I think Bob felt just frustrated that he couldn't be there because it became a kind of a media circus. I have to talk about what happened today with, uh, Paul Watson, was the name of your friend, and is the name of your friend and colleague, who was injured on the floes. HUNTER: He handcuffed himself to one of the cables that is attached to the pile of seal pelts. (LOUD THUD) (WATSON SCREAMING) And they dragged him across the ice, into the water, smashed him against the side of the boat. With him sort of hanging by one arm, they dunked him four times, which is, of course, Arctic temperature water in the North Atlantic. MAN 1: Take him to the hospital immediately. MAN 2: And get our helicopters permission to land here right away. I can't. I have no contact with your helicopter. Look, assholes, do something! Those guys tried to kill me! -I have no authority. -WATSON: I don't care -if you have no authority! Do something! -Okay, let's put him in the... HUNTER: Four of our other people had to go in to rescue him. Uh, he's now onboard one of the icebreakers with a broken arm, back damage and suffering from exposure. (SHOUTING) WATSON: I was flown back. I remember getting out of the helicopter and this woman came and started hugging and kissing me and I didn't know who that was, and, uh, then I left and I said to Bob Cummings, "Who the hell's that?" And he said, "Oh, that's Brigitte Bardot." (SPEAKING FRENCH) Canadians! Assassins! This must finish. It has to stop! For you and the sake of the whole world (REPORTER SPEAKING IN FRENCH) The publicity accompanying the arrival of Brigitte Bardot has seized world opinion. WATSON: Brigitte Bardot turned the pages in our favor so dramatically that it was never turned back. You know, the Canadian government hated her for it, but, uh, she's sort of like me, she doesn't give a damn. REPORTER: Are you willing to die for a seal? If I die for a seal, I die for a seal, but I don't think I'm going to have to die for a seal. I don't think it will come to that. That was when you discovered just how male-dominated Greenpeace was, because guys were absolutely smitten with Brigitte Bardot. MOORE: Bob wanted to take a break, and so he designated me to go as the representative of the organization while Paul Watson was the leader of the campaign. WATSON: Patrick was there as vice president of Greenpeace to watchdog me. (CHUCKLES) At one point, Pat Moore said he was going out to the ice with Brigitte Bardot and I said, "No you're not." I said, "I don't have room for you because I need every seat "for somebody with a camera and what am I gonna do with you?" MOORE: Paul had invited 80 European journalists and only had two helicopters. WATSON: And he said, "Let me just put it this way. "If we're not in that helicopter, you're out the door." I said, "Well, let me put it this way. You're not getting in the helicopter." BOBBI: They think had Bob been there, he was always the glue, the mediator, he was always the person who could bring calm and sanity to the group, and he wasn't there to do that. REPORTER: Officials from the Department of Fisheries have been closely monitoring the activities of the Greenpeace Foundation. The officials also have exhibits against the Foundation, which could be used for possible charges. The exhibits include the handcuffs used by one member to attach himself to a ship. MOORE: And he did it without telling anybody he was going to do it. He was part of a team and all of a sudden, he's gone off like a loose cannon. It wasn't part of the plan, and that was like the fourth or fifth or sixth time that he had behaved in that way towards the rest of us. Pat saw this as an opportunity to kick Paul out of the organization. (INAUDIBLE) WALRUS: He was condemned by others in Greenpeace for destroying property. Well, give me a break. (LAUGHS) I was never one to condemn some material rearrangement of molecules of something, even though it might be called property destruction. HUNTER: No one doubts Paul's courage for a moment, but he seems possessed by too powerful a drive. We all feel we've got trapped in a web no one wants to see develop. There is nothing to do but bring down the axe, even if it means bringing it down on the neck of our brother. And by an 11-to-1 vote, him being the one, that was decided. I think everybody understood that that would be better for everybody. BOBBI: Bob felt excruciatingly torn over letting Paul go. That's the last thing he really wanted to do, but it was only as a result of putting those two young lions together on one hill. MAN: And I say to the Greenpeace Foundation that when they undertook saving the seals that they did not do their homework properly. REPORTER: Do the members of Greenpeace get paid anything? How many contributors do you have? How much money did you take in in dues last year? Do you think, that at 34, you could be doing better things with your life? BOBBI: He needed a break, really needed a break. MAN: All right, here's Bob Hunter from Greenpeace. Well, basically, as far as I can see, it's all over. It's just a 200-year mop-up operation now. -(CHEERING) -Yeah! HUNTER: Is there a point simply in life where everything you believe turns inside out? You begin to doubt it all. What is leadership but tricking other people into your own hallucinations? -Can I start again? -MAN: Yeah, sure. BOBBI: He lost heart. He looked at me and said, "It's time." And that was it and then he put his resignation in. MOORE: In the middle of the spring of '77, Bob handed the reins over to me. Within a year, the conflicts that arose because of that had virtually torn the organization apart. MOORE: The challenge that we faced was the proliferation of Greenpeace offices that had no cohesive management. (DOOR BELL RINGS) By the time I took over from Bob in early '77, the horses were well out of the barn. You could never have 50 Greenpeace groups all operating simultaneously and wanting to be independent and anarchistic. Pat always thought that he knew exactly what was right and what was the best way to do things, and he was somewhat dictatorial. All the organizations outside of Vancouver revolted. We were $150,000 or more in debt, and San Francisco office, which we had created, was now making 10 times as much money as we were able to raise, yet they didn't wanna pay our debt. It has to be eventually resolved. Who is the ultimate authority over the name Greenpeace? WALRUS: "It started in Vancouver. We're in charge. "All these outfits out here, "they're supposed to send money to us and we'll call the shots." Well, that wasn't gonna work. WEYLER: This was a social movement. It wasn't a corporation where the new president suddenly lays down the law and everybody goes along with him. Next thing we know, Pat Moore started a lawsuit against our group in San Francisco. MOORE: We're willing to go through with it and we're willing to be candid with people about the fact that, even in the environmental movement, there are corporate takeover bids and rip-offs and people who are trying to steal our name and all of the rest of it going on. That didn't go over well with hippies. MOORE: It wasn't an easy time for Eileen and I. San Francisco, in turn, sent a bailiff to our house with a personal lawsuit against us for a million dollars for defamation. We lost a lot of friends during that time because they didn't think what we were doing was right. It was enough to make you lose a fair amount of hair off the front of your head, as you may notice. (VOCALIZING) BOBBI: Bee-boo! (BABY COOING) BOBBI: We moved away soon after into the countryside. We started a family. Every time anyone would be speaking about Greenpeace, I would, you know, that was it. I said, "No G word in this house." (CHUCKLES) (SIGHS) I was tired of it all. I think Bob was discouraged and heartbroken. We didn't object to the fact that Greenpeace had to be organized and managed, but organizing and managing should not become the purpose, that the purpose was still a cultural revolution. And Bob felt betrayed by Patrick, that this deeper ecological purpose was in danger of being lost. HUNTER: I realize I've committed the paramount sin of quitting my earthly duty. A hole of guilt has opened in my soul. It's either time for someone to escort me away or for one last push for unity. How can we save the planet if we cannot save ourselves? (TYPEWRITER CLACKING) MOORE: Bob got back involved to pull the organization together. I said to Bob, "You know, you said you were leaving, "you're out of it, you haven't been part of this, "so why would you try to dictate what's going to happen?" BOBBI: Bob decided that really the best thing to do was for Greenpeace to get out of the hands of the local grassroots and move into the international arena. WEYLER: He decided to find a new leader, essentially. The most obvious choice was David McTaggart. MOORE: David McTaggart, who was the head of Greenpeace Europe, had got every other Greenpeace office in the world to be against us. I was perceived as the enemy by all the rest at this time, though. Uh, all those in favor of these two flowers continuing their voyage along the river of life... MOORE: I described Bob as my best friend and my best enemy. I mean, he fought dirty, uh, but he was a worthy opponent. (ALL LAUGHING) WEYLER: It was not pleasant for any of us, displacing Patrick, 'cause we were still friends. But we couldn't let him stay on in that leadership role. WALRUS: McTaggart and Rod Marining and Bob Hunter and a few others met in my basement in Kitsilano, and we planned the founding of Greenpeace International in 1979. McTaggart came up with a plan and Bob considered it. If we internationalized Greenpeace so that Vancouver is no longer considered to be the center of it all, but one of an equal number, Australia, United States, New Zealand, Amsterdam, London, they're all gonna be separate and equally powerful. Then we'll give Patrick Vancouver and then all the lawyers involved with suits against each other would drop their lawsuits. Patrick was invited to receive Canada and give up the world. (LAUGHS) MOORE: I gladly signed that agreement. At that moment, when we created Greenpeace International, we made something bigger out of a bunch of disparate fragments that had fallen apart, basically. You know, we had a saying in Greenpeace, "You can't get off the boat," uh, which was just to mean that you don't wanna. Once you're in it, you're enjoying it and you're succeeding, you don't wanna stop, um, and indeed, it's not easy to get off that boat. WEYLER: Trying to cling onto power is a fundamental mistake. It's something we learned from The I Ching. It's such a hard lesson to learn. Suddenly, Greenpeace was raising millions of dollars worldwide by this time and we just gave it away. We did it. HUNTER: No matter how big a movement grows, its blueprint is found in its seed. I think of Greenpeace from the very beginning as a natural phenomenon. All of us were involved because we had to be. We were part of a reflex, summoned to action by the Earth itself. SPONG: I think Greenpeace is a real force in the world and that it accomplishes great things. Uh, but save the planet, you know, that's the... That's the aim here. (CHEERING) REPORTER: The International Whaling Commission has imposed at least a partial ban on factory ship whaling. SPONG: In 1982, a 10-year moratorium on commercial whaling was finally put together. WEYLER: As far as we're concerned, it's the conservation event of the decade in that at least 7,000 whales have been saved per year, because that's approximately what they were killing each year. WATSON: The important part of that period was the realization that a small group of individuals can make an impact and that they could do it without many resources. I believe that Greenpeace was more powerful when it had nothing than it is today with its hundreds of millions of dollars. WEYLER: I am very proud of Greenpeace. The real ecology movement is a long, multi-generational phenomenon. It's really a lesson that nature is going to teach humanity and we're just trying to help it along. We made a difference, you know. It doesn't mean you can stop. (LAUGHS) (IN SING-SONG VOICE) Emily. It's too early in the morning. I don't wanna go to school. Sorry, sweetheart. EMILY HUNTER: When I grew up, my father moved away from traditional activism into his media journalism role. In many ways he really struggled making this new life with my family. Anybody who thinks that the warming trend is just a theory and not a fact need look no further than these mountains of salt piling up, which are all the salt that was not used on the roads and metro last year because there was virtually no winter. EMILY: He really knew that this would become the defining issue of our time and it would surpass really all environmental issues because they were all interconnected to this one issue of climate change. I think he found himself again, he found his role again, that he could be that leader again in society. Planet Earth, I say love it or leave it. I'm Bob Hunter, covering ecology. EMILY: He felt like he could actually use media again as his tool for change. Hey, skipper! Permission to come aboard! Permission granted, Bob. BOBBI: The most exciting things after Greenpeace was being with Paul Watson, and the most meaningful. I just wonder what keeps the fire in your belly. -Anger. You gotta keep angry. -Yeah. BOBBI: Bob would go out with Paul's new organization, the Sea Shepherd Society. They were both action junkies. It's 10 after 9:00. The nearest drifter boat is just off to our starboard here. We're closing in. -WATSON: Okay, here we go. -(SHIP'S HORN BLARES) WATSON: Sea Shepherd was set up as an anti-poaching organization. (LOUD THUD) In 1979, when I hunted down and rammed the pirate whaler Sierra, I was brought before the port captain and accused of, um, negligence. I said, "Well, there wasn't anything negligent about it. "I mean, we hit the ship exactly where we intended to hit it." MOORE: People support Paul just like they cheer for Rambo in the movies. It's the same kind of thing. He is trying to create a real-life action figure image, which he's done very successfully. And I see him as a real-life hero in many aspects. I was with Greenpeace for 15 years and helped create it. It has turned into something I'm regretful about. Hi. Are you guys media? Help yourself to any of this literature here. BOBBI: You can't become such an anti-Greenpeace person and still command any level of, uh, love and respect, you know? MOORE: Greenpeace is back in the Dark Ages somewhere, against genetic science being used to make our food and medicine better. But if they wanna keep that position, fine. WATSON: Patrick was able to turn his former position into a money-making endeavor, representing first the salmon farmers and then miners and loggers and the nuclear industry, so he became a PR organization defending all of the enemies of Greenpeace. Bob felt quite betrayed by that and coined the term Eco-Judas. REPORTER: You do concede that human-induced carbon emissions have contributed to global warming in the second half of the 20th century? No, I do not. We do not have proof that we are the cause of warming. It isn't warming much, anyways, so even if CO2 is a greenhouse gas, it's not having anywhere near the effect that people thought it would, but... This whole anti-globalization, anti-capitalism, anti-business, uh, orientation of the environmental movement is extremely destructive. SPEAKER: Our next witness is Dr. Patrick Moore. Please proceed with your statement. In 1971, as a PhD student in ecology, I joined an activist group in a church basement in Vancouver, Canada. We became Greenpeace. After 15 years in the top committee, I had to leave, as Greenpeace began to adopt policies that I could not accept from my scientific perspective. There is no reason to believe that a warmer climate would be anything but beneficial for humans and the majority of other species. Please see Exhibit 3. WEYLER: I don't consider Patrick an active ecologist. Patrick Moore is a public relations specialist, selling his affiliation to Greenpeace to his corporate clients. We live in different worlds now. EMILY: By the time I realized that I wanted to be an environmentalist myself, my father shared the news with me that he had terminal cancer, um, and only about a year and a half left. In that time, I wanted to be as close to my father as possible, but he told me he wanted me to go on my first campaign with Sea Shepherd rather than just be by his side, and so I did and it changed my life. I shared the stories of every little thing, every sea-sickness event, um, every arrest. At one point I was taken hostage. I shared everything with him, uh, in writing and in emails and our correspondence together, and I could tell it just gave him maybe one of those last little highs in life. You know, Bob and I could never speak about his death, (VOICE BREAKING) and I can't now, but, um... Bob was a real global person, and what I wanted to do to honor him was to take him to all four corners of the planet. EMILY: He had never been able to go to Antarctica. He really wanted to fight on that front. For Paul, it was his way to get to say goodbye to his brother. I always thought of it as my dad's last campaign, and it was one of my first campaigns, and it was kind of completing both of our missions. (STAMMERING) What I wouldn't give just for one more day, you know, just one, you know... If you could just have Bob back and go to the pub. (CHUCKLES) HUNTER: I realize something I had forgotten, something I learned at the height of the '60s, that my separate existence is an illusion. Ecology is flow. You and I are most definitely part of the flow. Everything we do affects the flow, and everything the flow does affects us. It doesn't really matter what I read or think or write. Don't judge me by my words, which are many, but by my actions, which are few. Because if we wait for the meek to inherit the Earth, there won't be anything left to inherit.
