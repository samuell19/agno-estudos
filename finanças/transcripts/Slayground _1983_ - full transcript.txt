That's a mite mature, ma'am. - Oh, it is? - Yeah. See, I had you figured for a much younger woman. The itchy side of legal. - You did? - Mm-hmm. How much of that squirrel juice do you have? Get off the car. Pretty fancy, hot stuff. What else can you do? Why don't you just get in? - What's your name? - Jolene. - What's yours? - Laufman. Is that a first name or a last name? I only got one name. Everybody has two names. Not me. I bet you're all action. Why don't you just lay back and find out? Everybody has two names. I was kidding. Stone, you dumb son of a bitch, how you doin"? I'm all right. How are you? All right. Where's laufman? - What time was he leaving? - Yesterday. I know yesterday. What time? - Said he was gonna leave early. - What time? Take it easy, man. Back off. He was gonna leave early 'cause he didn't wanna burn the edge off his hot rod. Well, he oughta be here. Got me a hair cut about a week ago. Some old dude sitting in a chair next to me. Gets a look at his head, the back of his head in the mirror. Say s, "El evens are up.‚Äù Ohh. Says, "when the elevens are up, you're finished." And he points to the back of his neck. He's got two tendons sticking up like that, you know. I says, "no." I says... "It just means you're getting thin. Then he looks at me. "As everybody knows, son... When the elevens are up... You're finished." Well, I'd like you to be there. It's the first time she's skated in public. Okay, who's on the market? Huh? Who? I don't want him. Yeah. Fifty three thousand. You got a deal. Hold on a minute. Cut out the shit! Let's go, guys. Let's go, bring it in. Ain't nothing gonna keep laufman from gettin' his hands on that money. - He'll be here. - You believe that? I swear to god, true as I'm standing here. Well, it never had you down for a Christian, Joey. We got no car, no driver. Maybe we ought to forget it. Shit or get off the pot. Don't keep me hanging, stone. I'll drive. I ain't no laufman, but who the fuck is? What are you gonna drive? This bedpan? - We steal a car. - You're pathetic. Look, it's not any car. It's not any three. It's you and me and laufman. We need laufman. The bone dumb bastard ain't gonna get here. Come on, there's plenty other drivers. Fuckin' trees! Yeah, it's gonna be easy. Mm-hmm. Sure. Hang on a second. Come on. Is this lonzini? All right. Uh-huh. Bye. I told you. What'd I tell you? My man's good. I don't know. He sounds like a punk to me. You know, I don't usually give auditions, man. This isn't an audition. - It's a dress rehearsal. - All right! Goddamn, this kid can drive, stone! Keep that leg straight, Lucy. Good. Good. Your daddy's gonna be very pleased with you. All right. Back's nice and straight, honey. Come on, come on. Beautiful! Great. Come on, come here! Wonderful! Wonderful! Mm. Sweetheart, that's wonderful. You're getting better every time. Every time. Now, if you're gonna win, right, you're gonna have to really learn that new music. Now play the tape in the car all the way home. Gimme a kiss. Bye, now. Bye, daddy! All right. Thanks, Greta. - Not at all. See you later. - Okay. - Take care of my champion. - Will do. Ah. Joey, grab this. Hey, go on. I got the rest. Where the fuck's this gold, man? Go, man, go! Man alive! Fucking cash, man! Fucking cash! Okay, jerk bags. Cool it. Oh, man. What are we gonna do with all this money? Less than a minute. Slow down. You don't wanna wreck up now. I'm not doing that. Slow down. This ain't a race. You wanted a driver, I'm driving! Take it easy, man! Just take it easy, would you, man? - Watch out for the car, man! - Lonzini! Oh, god! You really screwed it now, man! - Stop the car! - Come on, lonzini, we gotta go back. No way, man. We gotta get out of here. Stop this car! Stop this car! Oh, god, no. What the hell's the matter with you? Huh? Huh? - I didn't see the car, man. - You didn't see the car. We're in the clear. All you had to do was drive. - Get out, you punk! - What is it, man? - I'm gonna blow your fuckin' brains out. - Wait, come on! No! No, don't! No! Yo, no, leave him! - You just killed a kid! - God, stone. Come on! You gone crazy, man? We gotta get the hell out of here. There's a kid in that car and she's dead! They're gone, stone. Dead. Killing him ain't gonna bring 'em back. Leave the little scum, man. He ain't worth shit. Get the fuck outta here. I've never killed anybody before. We've done all we could. It's more than just a robbery now. You are talking to a machine. Talk now. I'm j.L. Danard. My little girl, my... child has been murdered. I need your help. Whatever it costs. Mr. danard? You come highly recommended. I know I do. You know what is required? Vengeance, I believe. Pretty music. Papa-oom-mow-mow papa-oom-mow-mow papa-oom-mow-mow papa-oom-mow-mow papa-oom-mow-mow very funny, asshole. Did you get it? Papa-oom-mow-mow well, I hear this sound everywhere I go stop fucking around, man. I know it's you. Did you get the paint? Mr. lonzini. Yeah, that's my name. Who are you? I've been looking for you. What do you want, man? Don't you know? That won't help you. What do you want? It was stone! Stone and sheer! Come on. Damn. Sweet revenge, Mr. danard. Aw, shit. Word is, you're walking dog's meat. - Who is he? - Who knows? No one knows. That's what I've been trying to tell you. I used up a lot of favors. Business sucks. I can't afford a new suit for your funeral. Very funny. He don't have feelings. He don't think about things like you and me. You're not in his league. You got one chance. Bury yourself. Quiet. Jessie girl, quiet. Hold still. Go chew some ass, girl. Get them freeloading bastards. I know you're in here, you thieving bastards. Jesse. Where are you, girl? Oh, no. Aw, baby. Oh, my god, you sick... I had a dog like that, once... When I was young. What's your problem, chicken shit? I don't have a problem, Mr. sheer. You get your kicks outta killing dumb animals? All right, what do you want? Yeah? Don't talk. Just listen. Huh? Me listen? No, you listen. It's been three months since... Okay. Night, Dwayne. It's almost like old times. Me waiting for you. Scared to death you'll come home to me in a box. I want us to go away. Right away. Somewhere where we can be together. Because this is the last time I sit around and wait for you like a lost dog. Could be. Somebody wants me dead. So when I look in and, uh, I saw her... The kid... I died. I swear to god, joni. I died inside. You weren't driving. A kid is dead. Somebody's responsible. Why does it have to be you? Because I knew that lonzini was too young, too full of himself. He's a punk car thief with no class. I should've said to Joey... We should've come home. There's this place in Mexico near amersio. I got some friends there. And if that sick son of a bitch gets within 100 miles of you... I am not gonna be jerked around like that anymore. If I have to go to Mexico, you're gonna take me. That's how it is with married people, remember? That's not what this is about, joni, and that's not why I'm here. You are going south, and I am going north, as far away from Mexico as I can get, and I'll let that asshole with a hat know where I am. - I wanna be with you. - You wanna be dead? I would rather be dead than sitting in some stinking Mexican town, counting the flies, waiting to hear about it. You know, we are not communicating very well. Alone, I might just make it. With you around my neck, I'm already dead. Now, I want you gone. I want you lost. You are the only way that he can get to me. You're really a bad liar, you know that? He shot Joey five times. He tied him in a chair, covered with shit and feathers like a fairground freak. This guy kills people and enjoys it. I'm just a thief. What can I do? And friends, the other half. That's right. Now, I want you to let the true spirit flow up your arm, right into your heart. And if you have eczema, psoriasis... Sixty seconds. It's a three-part question. A star prize if you get all three. Here we go. - Hello? - You get big Billy's horn! What'd I say? What'd I say? I mean, if I'd known you were... Or at least booked a hotel room. Okay, no more kidding here. Maureen, three-part question. Think, honey. A state with four letters... Utah! Second part: A state of mind. Four letters. - Oh, it's love! - Love. Ah! Artiel you scared the shit outta me. Did you bring it? No, no, my back! Oh, god. Hey, Chuck. Charlie. Mr. Willis. I like this better than stone. Thanks, Artie. I won't forget it. - Where are you going? - London. Why London? - Terry abbatt. - That's right. It must be about, what, five years since Terry left Chicago, went back to London? Yeah. I'm all busted up inside, Artie. Well, that's gonna cost you. And you've had enough! He'd be doing ten to 20 if you hadn't gone back for him that time. We thought he was dead. - Would've left him. - T knew. I don't know how I knew, but some kind of... instinct. - He owes you. - He knows that. Family. That's what Terry used to call joni and me. Family. 'Cause he never had any. He used to call me... brother stone. I gotta get myself sorted out, Artie. It's gonna cost. Terry's got money. He's always got money. Wait for me. Hi, I'm stone. I'm looking for Terry abbatt. I'm a friend of his from America. He's not here anymore. Can you tell me where he is? - Hold on a minute. I'll take you to him. - Thanks. Terry should've stayed in America. All that jive. He liked it. It suited him. - What happened? - A fire. He often spoke of you. You became part of his American myth. And the man doesn't measure up to the myth, huh? No man could. Not the way Terry told it. But then Terry was a liar. Wasn't he? You've had a wasted journey. Bang. You're dead. I know what you're thinking. Who are these gentlemen? We're the grievance committee. You've had your nose up where it don't belong. Now I want you to get up slowly. Very slowly. And I wanna impress upon you one thing. My colleague is a very violent man. One wrong move, and we're gonna collect your face in a bucket. What's this all about? We're sending you back home where you belong. Come here, boy! Stay down. Who are you? Willis. Charles Willis. East Lansing, Michigan. My pills. Oh, Jesus! What is your name? Charles Willis. Stone. My fucking name is stone. Which do I believe, brother stone? Go home, stone. Terry's dead and buried. There's nothing for you here. Who the fuck are you? I'm not getting through to you. I don't want you around. Understand? Whatever Terry promised, forget. Do you follow? I'm beginning to. He's flown to england, so I was told. My instructions remain precisely as before. London, Tokyo, Rome. You find him and kill him. It will be done. Your information, is it reliable? Water tight. Whoever did this, Mr. Willis, must have trained in an abattoir. How long were you confined after surgery? - Nine days. - Days? I could walk. You should be dead. I think that was the general idea. Well, now... there are several splinters of metal still in the back, with at least two lodged in the spine. They'll have to come out. - Uh, when could you... - Doctor. These are real antiques. How much is this new body gonna cost? Without surgery, Mr. Willis, you'll be in a wheelchair within a year. Which do I believe, brother stone? Terry was a liar, wasn't he? - Go home. - Wheelchair within a year. - Terry was a liar, wasn't he? - Which do I believe? He was a liar, wasn't he? He was a liar, wasn't he? Which do I believe? Liar! Liar! Liar! Now, somebody is lying here. I know Terry's alive. Now, if I don't find Terry, I die. You're gonna help me. Start talking. All it had on it was my address, typed. How did you know it was from Terry? How did you know he wasn't dead in that bank? - Did you try to find him? - I wanted to. But... The white one's a cockatoo. It's very rare. I did ring. - I'm looking for Mrs. conners. - She's my aunt. She's not in at the moment. When will she be back? - Who are you? - My name's Chuck Willis. I'm looking for a relative of mine. He moved up here from London. His name's Terry abbatt. No. Sorry. Brother Terry? No. Look, I've been everywhere, Terry. It's no good. I'm bankrupt. Well, screw the banks. Bloody undertakers. What do they know? Listen, we're gonna make a real good killing next year. It's gonna be a good season. A great season. - I've had an offer. - Already? - From venner. - Oh, for Christ... Look, venner is a gangster. I thought we might just be able to get through another season, but it's no good. What about venner? What's he, eh? Rubbish. I'll have his eyes. What's all the fucking fuss about? A man come to the house. American. He's looking for you, Terry. Oh, yeah? What'd he look like? Bloody weird. Gave me the creeps. - Did he have a name? - Yeah. Ellis. No, Willis. He said relative, brother Terry. Where is he? So what if she doesn't accept your offer? She will. Crazy old cow. But she might not. She might try to hang on here for another season. Then she'll have to be persuaded. Get a list of the people who work for her, the regulars. A lot of timber around here. I'd call that a serious fire hazard. I wonder if she's adequately insured? Bloody hell! There's no one up there. Can I help you... Gentlemen? Easy. It was an accident. That was no accident. You're trespassing. Do you know who I am, Mr. abbatt? Yeah, you're an old man in a big car with a dog. And you're on private property. Shall I drop him, Mr. venner? He wants to go walkies. Oh dear. He's fallen over. You're looking fit... For a corpse. It's good to see you, brother. How did you find me? - Some woman. - Mm. Still don't smile much, Terry. Yeah, well, you don't when you're dead. You in trouble? I know the feeling. I can get three. Maybe three and a half. It's enough to get joni over here. Couple of months' living expenses. - Well, why not? - Come on. Yeah, okay. Just leave it. Uh, just leave it. So what are you gonna do? What I do best. What, a loan? Oh, no. No way, pal. You haven't been listening, have you? I tell you, that is finished. I've retired. - I'm a businessman now. - Without a business. You need money, I need money. You're fucking crazy, do you know that? Do you? You've lived half your life, and where are you? Five thousand miles from home in a bankrupt seaside town, on a snide passport, talking shit to a dead man. And what have you got? What have you got? You haven't got a pot to piss in. No money, your wife in hiding in some shithole in Mexico... Half-crippled by some fucking maniac. Jesus. All that bollocks you were giving me about, uh, - about you and joni starting a... - I meant that. Ah, fuck you did! This would be the last time, Terry. Christ! How many times have I heard that? Every villain I've ever known... And how do they end up? Three in a cell in some fucking victorian dungeon. Or worse, lying dead in the gutter. What else am I gonna do, huh, Terry? I'm backed up against the wall. You tell me what else. Tell me! What am I gonna do in a wheelchair, Terry? You talk to me about prison? You'd just be about up for your parole right now if I hadn't got that... Oh, yeah, I wondered when that would... I knew that was coming up. - You owe me! - Yeah, I owe you! And that is why I am not gonna let you fuck up the other half of your life. How much do you need? Bottom line. Get your back sorted out. You and joni, couple of years in the sun. What? Hundred grand? Hundred and twenty? Well... Well, maybe I can raise that. I don't know, maybe. That's a lot of money, Terry. You gonna borrow it from venner? Excuse me a minute. Have a good day. Nearly a hundred grand, eh? - Yeah, just watch it. - Keep your eyes open a bit. Yeah, right. Don't worry, I'm staring. I have this thing with cats. They come to me. Body heat. It must be body heat. It would seem that you and Mr. stone are... Acquainted. Did you hear me, madam? Madam? - Yes. - Good. Good. Ah. I had to disappear. Things were getting heavy. Out of order. I went to cypress. That's where I met madge. She was on holiday there. Came back up here with her. She knows about it. And Fran. These have been the best two years of my life. This time I have work for a living, anyway. I like it. I love this place. You give me five years, I could make madge a million. Smells good. Terry sent me to look after you. Uh, tell me about venner. He's a vulture. Terry has scars like yours. We were both war heroes. He was shot. Well, you know Terry. No, I don't. He treats me and madge like... family. But I don't know him. Thanks. There you go. Hello, 5853. Hello? May I talk to you? Come in. There's nearly 11,000. I know you need more, but it's all that I've got. - I don't need any money. - No, please. Please take it. And leave Terry alone. Sit down. He's not the same man that you knew in America. He told me what you did for him. I-I know that he owes you his life. He's a very honorable man. He will repay that debt. And if anything ever happened to him, I don't know what I'd do. Look, madge... Terry's an old friend of mine that I came to say hello to. That's all. You won't tell him that I came to see you. He may not understand. I won't see him. I'll be gone in an hour. Tell him that I'll send him a postcard. - Good night. - Good night, Mr. webb. - See you. - Good night. What the fuck's that? Look out, he's coming again. Oh, no! Dave? Dave? Oh. Where's Terry? You promised me you were going away. Where is Terry? Terry's not the same man you knew in America. - Don't let him die. - Where is he? A man came here. He's taken Terry away. He left me to tell you. To tell me what? Welcome to your funeral, Mr. stone. You thought that was your friend... Brother Terry. That isn't him. He's still waiting for you, Mr. stone. Don't keep him waiting. I'm the shadow man, Mr. stone. I'm all around you. I don't like a man to die not knowing my name. Don't you wanna know my name, Mr. stone? Only shoot what you see. Like the mad hatter. I'm all around you, Mr. stone. I see your every move. Wrong again. You'll never find me. You'll never find me. You'll never find me. I'm the shadow man, Mr. stone. Fuck you. Stone... I'm still here. There's nothing you can do. He just had to die, stone, because of you. No! When this is over... I think I'm gonna find your wife in Mexico. I'll tell her how you died. Then I'll take care of her.
