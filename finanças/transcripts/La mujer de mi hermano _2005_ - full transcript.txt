MY BROTHER'S WIFE What would you do without me? Ready. l had my 20 grapes for breaMast. Can't it be 21? No, it has to be 20... not one more. You're nuts! Maybe. At least l don't talk to insects. Zoe... you're not going to mass dressed like that, are you? Better wear what l got you. l don't like it, Ignacio. Baby, this dress is too flashy for mass... There'll be a lot of people, l don't like it. Listen to me. Did you find my mother's prayer book? Yes. l hope it helps. The Lord be with you. And with your spirit. The blessing of Almighty God... ...Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost... ...descend upon you. Amen. - You may go in peace. - Thanks Be to God. Alright? Let's go. - Hi, Santiago! - Ignacio! - Congratulations. - Thanks a lot. Parish priest, who'd say? Monsignor Moretti has been very generous with his decision. l'm so glad you could come. Zoe knows we cannot Iose faith, Santiago. Faith is the main thing, Ignacio. Zoe, you must be strong in spirit... ...to support your husband. By the way... ... l'd like to recommend this book. ''Path'', by Balaguer. lt will help a lot with your problems. We could talk about it if you come visit. l promise l'll read it. Well, we're om... My mother's expecting us for lunch at her house. God bless you. Give my love to Christina. - Thank you. - Thank you. Excuse us. Oh, Santiago! Keep up the good behavior and you'll become the Pope. God willing, Ignacio. You can't imagine how sorry l am! l really hoped the doctors had finally found a way to give me a grandchild. - Yes, it's a pity, Mother, - Thank you, Mercedes. There'll only be three of us again. Why's that? Isn't Gonzalo coming? Oh, Gonzalo must be painting. He forgets time when he works. Son... ...why don't you call him for me? lf you ask him, maybe he'll come. A mother, Zoe, is never wrong... ...my children aren't the same anymore. They were... ...more than brothers. They were friends and... ...suddenly... ...something happened. Boys' things. l left him a message, but l don't think he'll hear it. Let's begin without him. Hello. - Hey, Raulito. - Hi! lt can't be. lmpossible! Gee, it must be a miracle. Take that painting downstairs, please. - How're you? - What's up, sister-in-law? -How're you? - Fine. You? Fine! Alright, man, it's good to see you! Same here. We waited for you at your mother's house. Yeah, l know, but l've been really busy with the show and-- How's it going? Better to ask how it went. l'm already... ...taking down the paintings. But come in and see what's left of it. This one is really nice. Like it? And why the unexpected pleasure? Well, l came because... ...l want one of your paintings in my room. What do you think? Really? Well, choose one. Which one do you like? l like this one. Then it's yours. - Do l just take it. - Sure. This painting's worth 3 thousand dollars. lt's good, right? Do l have to pay for that? Yeah, well, l wouldn't take your money, but... ... l know my brother's going to enjoy it... ...so l'll have him pay for it. - Hey. - Hey. What's that? One of Gonzalo's paintings. Not bad. - You don't like it? - l like it. - If you don't, l won't hang it. - No, l told you l did. Did he give it to you? Did he charge you? Not much. The son-of-a-bitch! lsn't it enough with what l send him every month? Did he have to sell you the damn painting? Don't overreact, Ignacio, it's just 3 thousand dollars. lt's not the money. lt's what he does. l work my ass om in the factory Dad left us. And Gonzalo doesn't lift a finger. He just stays home painting or screwing around. l send him a lot of cash every month, Zoe, so it's not money he needs. lt was in very poor taste to charge you for the painting. We can adopt if you want. No. Why not, Zoe? lt's not such a bad idea. Look, if l can't conceive, there must be a reason. - It was God's will. - No. Maybe He wants us to adopt. Leave God out of this. So...? So nothing. We're not adopting. l don't want to. Honey... ...if l ever have a child, l want him to look like me... ...smell like me... my flesh and blood. But we can't, darling. You mean, you can't. So what? Would you have a kid with another man? No. Love... ...l'm calling to tell you... ... l'm having lunch with Boris so don't wait for me. No. Tell you later. So do l, baby. Bye. l had to lie to him. l couldn't tell him l was with you. Why? What's wrong with you being with me? Nothing, but... ... Ignacio wouldn't approve of me posing for you. He wouldn't like you painting me at all. He'd go ballistic. He's such an asshole. Very good. Don't smile so much. There! You still haven't told me what the snapshots are for. l'll tell you. Move to the edge of the bed. l take the pictures... ...turn them into slides, l project them... ...and then l start painting on them. - Is this alright? - It's pe_ect. You look tense. Why don't you relax and lie down? Go on! Like that, right, very good. lgnacio... He's a lucky son-of-a-bitch. He doesn't deserve a goddess like you, man. - l can't take it anymore. - Hello? We only make love on Saturdays. - Zoe? - Only on Saturdays? He says he enjoys it more that way. That he has better climaxes. He has always been an asshole. You should've seen him when he saw your painting. l can imagine, He's jealous of me. l don't know why he did it. l swear l don't get it. Jealousy. He's jealous of me, because he knows l'm happy. He knows l love what l do, and that bothers him. He's so damn bitter about working in a factory... ...because he never had the guts to do what he likes. Don't say that, he's your brother. - And he's my husband. - l don't give a damn... ...that he's my brother, man. He didn't have to treat my painting like that. You know how long it takes to paint one of those? l know, Gonza. Maybe it was my fault. l shouldn't have told him you sold it to me. That's not the problem, man. He's got money to burn. The thing is l painted it. You know what? l think... l'd better go. Why? l need to sleep. l'm exhausted. You can rest here. l mean... ...you can have some wine and... ...if you're tired you can sleep. Come on. l'll be painting... ...and there won't be any fighting. Hi. Where were you? Out. Out where? Why did you do it? l don't know. l lost it. Forgive me, okay? You're going crazy. lt just bugged me that he sold you the painting. lt made me angry. Why? - It shows he earns a living. - No, it's not. Gonzalo doesn't work. He's a lazy bum... ...who lives om what l give him each month. lt was my painting. l liked it. Yeah, sure, anything Gonzalo paints is cute. ls that why you called me? How many times must we go over this, honey? We've been together for three years, baby. - So what? - What do you mean? Any couple that has been together that long... ...should want to live together. What part of it don't you get? We aren't girlfriend and boyfriend, babe. l won't get married. l don't want kids. You and l are lovers, baby, and we're good. No strings attached, no conflicts, man. Save the bullshit for someone else. - Not for me. - Don't you like my bullshit? Then why don't you get yourself another guy... ...to give you head while l paint, huh? l'm fed up with you. Grow up, asshole! l'll call you tomorrow when the storm has blown over, doll. Hi. l just wanted to tell you l made a deposit. l threw in a little e_ra because... ...it was a good quarter. l'm sorry about the painting, dude. l don't know what happened, man. l think l lost it. l lost it. Fucking fag. See you. What's up, Zoe? What're you up to? l want to see you. l called so you'd see the photo before l paint it. Did l tell you Ignacio called? He wanted to meet, but l told him to go to hell. What did he say? Just bullshit. That if l sell you another painting... ...he's going to pis all over it. He's a fool. He's hopeless. Truth is l don't know how you can stand him. l get to see you once in a while. l haven't been able to get you out of my head. - Gonza... - Jesus, l like you so much! Me too, but... this is wrong. Promise me you'll keep it a secret. Obviously, babe. l'm a classy dame. Discretion is one of my greater virtues. Don't you think l've acted like a slut? Not at all! Besides, ladies have a right to act like sluts now and then. - But it's his brother! - So? Gonzalo's so hot. He's such a stud. l'm crazy about him! l envy you, girl. Don't feel bad. Guilt... ...was invented by priests. lf your husband doesn't realize he's neglecting you... ...that you're a lady, that you need maintenance as well... ...it's only fair, it's only right that you look for other ways to make up for it. And there's nothing wrong with kissing Gonzalo, what a stud... ...if he calls you again... ...don't miss your chance. l don't know. l feel like... a whore. Well, if you're a whore, where does that leave me? How can you wear two pairs of socks? My feet are frozen. Why? Does it bother you? No, it just always surprises me. l'm happier this way. And do we have to listen to this music night after night? Turn it om if you want. l'm going to bed. l'm tired and l have a business trip tomorrow. - Again? - Yes, again. l don't have any help at the factory. And l have to do all the important things myself. Don't be long. l'll be waiting for you. Darling? l'm om to the airport. Sure you won't come with me? Well, l'll be back in two days. Call you tonight, okay? Come in, Maria. You look very nice today. - Thanks, Maria. - Ma'am... -... l've got to tell you something. - Yes? l found this in the microwave. lt's kind of burned. l think it's one of those CDs with the funeral music... -... Mr. Ignacio likes. - Well, then... ... l'm glad. Throw it away. It's like there are... -...ghosts in the house. - l agree, ma'am. Fortunately, those ghosts go away every now and then. Looks like it. Excuse me. Call me if you need anything. Thank you, Maria. Okay! l put it on low. Yes, ma'am, the egg's almost done. What else? The rice is in the pot, right? Half an hour before, you just press this. Pe_ect! You know what to do with the salmon? Yes, Maria, l remember my cooking lessons. Of course, ma'am. Are you sure you won't need me tonight? Yes. Don't worry. In fact, you can take... -...the day om, tomorrow. - If you want... ...l can stay and help you serve. l like Mrs. Christina a lot. No thanks, Maria. - Who is it? - Forgot my keys. Open up, babe. lgnacio? Come on, it's Gonzalo. Open up, man! - Hello. - What's up? - Did l scare you? - Yes, you got me. l would've loved to see your face. - Welcome. - Thank you. lt's been a long time since you've visited. Yes, a very long time. That dress is great. Thanks. You look very nice. l brought wine. Thanks, l spent all afternoon in the kitchen. Oh, yeah? l spent all afternoon... -...thinking about you. - Gonza, don't! Don't what? Just a little kiss. No, this is Ignacio's house. - So what? - Gonza... ... l invited you for dinner because l like hanging out... ...with you, but... promise me you'll behave. l promise. Hello? Hi, darling. How are you? fine, very well. What were you up to? Nothing. l was about to have dinner. Zoe, you sound stressed. You alright? Yes, everything's fine. You? Fine, fine. Heavy day, lots of work, but... ... l'm finally back at the hotel. Zoe... do you love me? Of course. Why? Do you doubt it? No, l don't. l'd just like to hear you say it. Well, then, l love you, l love you, l love you. Alright. Three times is enough. See you on Wednesday. Sleep well. Recently l've been thinking about your wedding day. Truth is, what a boring wedding. Average age: 84 l danced with all my aunts, and my Mom's friends... Gee, how boring! really, guys. l recall... ...when l chased you to the bathroom, remember? Yeah. What an ordeal that was. First ... l had to keep an eye on Ignacio. Then, get away from all the old broads. You don't know how much l wanted to kiss you then. But you didn't want to. Why don't you leave him? l mean, it must be a bummer to be with someone who doesn't make love to you, huh? l can't. l don't like being alone. l don't want to live alone. l don't... l don't... like sleeping alone. You've got me. You're my brother-in-law. l can't be with you. You've got me as a friend, man. Well... -... l'll be going now. - No, don't go. Stay. You want me to sleep here? Yes. l don't want to sleep alone. Not today. Well, can l borrow a pillow and a blanket, l'll stay here. No problem. Why don't you sleep over there? Over where? Upstairs, with me. Nothing will happen. l just want you to keep me company. Yeah? Well. Want some PJs? To tell you the truth, if you don't mind... l wear my shorts to bed. No, l don't mind. Gonza? l need a hug. l've dreamed about you many times. Have you touched yourself thinking of me? Yes. And you? Have you touched yourself thinking of me? No. l don't believe you. Then don't. l don't believe you, you liar. l don't believe you. Wait! No, no, no! Oh, l can't believe this. No, don't go. Boris! This is delicious. For the love of God! Wipe that guilty look om your face. l wish l woke up with something to feel guilty about. Look at how he left, that is-- Who cares how he left? What matters is how you came. How was it? lt was divine. Well... nothing, excellent. It's alright. lt's just that... ...now you have... ...to go back... ...to your husband's bed like a good girl... ...and forget Gonzalo. Well, if you want a lover, well... l won't criticize you. l'm a philanthropist with my ass. l give it to the neediest. But not you. You can't do it with Gonzalito anymore. Oh, this is so good, baby! So good! - Tell me. - What, baby? Have you been with other women? Just answer me. Don't stop baby. Don't stop. Answer me. But come on, how can you ask that? Swear it. - Don't stop baby. - Swear it. - Swear it. - l swear. l swear on my brother. Come on! Who's the love of my life? l am. So? So? Talk dirty to me, baby. Zoe... ...sweetheart, is something wrong? No. l'm just very sensitive. Do you want us... ...to adopt a child? No. lt's not that. Then what is it? Are you sure you love me, honey? Of course, silly, of course. Do you have any doubts? Hold me. Come, come! Kiss me, okay? Remember today's not Saturday, honey. Sorry. A bit more, Zoe. Bend back a little, not too much. Sorry, it's my phone. Hello? Hi, Ignacio. What's up? l'm in yoga class. No, no, no. Go ahead, tell me. Lunch? Well... Hold on. l have another call. Gonza? Hi. Why did you leave without saying goodbye? No, l'm not angry. l can't right now. What hotel? Alright, yes. See you soon. Kiss. So... who was it? Gonzalo. You little slut! Oh, yeah? Look who's talking! Shouldn't we be taking precautions? Are you on the pill or what? What for? l can't have children. l thought it was Ignacio who couldn't. lgnacio can't... and neither can l. Good. Because l hate wearing condoms. What are you doing here? Enjoying the night. And those flowers? They're... ...for you. Where shall l put them? Throw them on me. Go on, throw them on me. Are you telling me to throw the flowers in the pool? Yes, what's the problem? You're like a goddess. Now, jump in. No, you're nuts. It's cold. Come on, honey, the water's delicious. Are you crazy? l'm not wearing... -...my trunks, Zoe. - Oh, how amul! The master of the house can't go skinny-dipping... ...with his wife in his own house. Don't be silly. Jump in. Alright... ...fine. - l'll catch a cold! - You're such an old lady. No, baby. What is it? Don't know. l'm cold, sweetheart. l'm sorry, but l'm getting out. l'm too cold. How's Boris? Devastated. Just imagine. He found his boyfriend with a woman. - You don't say. - Poor thing. Aren't you going to get dressed? No. You'll catch a cold if you don't cover up. Not... ...if you keep me warm. Honey, what is it with you? What are you on? Why do you analyze me all the time, Ignacio? Better make love to me. Today? Yes, today. And don't say it's not Saturday. Cut the crap. Honey, that's the way l am. l don't feel like it if it's not Saturday. But tomorrow's Saturday, darling. Yes? What are you doing? You'd rather masturbate than make love to me? No, silly, of course not. l just couldn't sleep. And l thought... ...maybe l could relax a bit more like this. Who were you thinking about? You. Promise? Promise. lf you were thinking about me... ...why didn't you wake me up? l don't know. It's... l didn't want to. You looked so sweet sleeping that... ... l didn't want to wake you up. But waking up like this... ...is better than sleeping. Much better. l went to see your dad this morning. l took him lilies. So pretty. Excuse me... This was made just for you. lt's fish. l'm allergic. Zoe didn't tell you? About 10 years ago... ...l had a fish stew that almost killed me. There's chicken in the fridge, Maria. l'll prepare it for you. Excuse me. Thank you. Anyway, we'll wait for Gonzalo. He's not coming, Mom. Gonzalo doesn't like this house. Look, your brother may always be late... ...and lazy, but you two? He loves you very much. Besides, he promised me he'd come. Don't worry, love, it must be Gonzalo. l'll get it. Maria, get the door, please. What's up? - Am l very late? - No, come in. We're used to it. How's the man with the money? Fine, fine. l'm glad you came, Gonzalo. - Come on! - No, seriously... ...Gonzalo, we're brothers. It's wrong to be so far apart, man. You know that in this house, we love you very much. As much as you love my paintings, asshole? Look... ...Gonzalo, l wanted to apologize personally... ...for what l did. l don't know what came over me. lt was stupid and rash. Will you forgive me? Come on, man, l don't want any jealousy between us. We're brothers, Gonzalo. Quite the contrary. l'm glad you're here in your house, having lunch with the family. Come on. Mom's waiting for us. ln fact... ...we should have lunch together once a week, man. - What do you say? - As long as you're buying... ... l'm okay with that. Thanks. How's the most beautiful woman on the planet? - At last. - Hey. - How are you, mother? - Very well. lt's good to see you. Hey, sis. Hi, Gonza! - How're you doing? - Fine. - Brought a bottle of wine. - Thanks. You shouldn't have. Yes, l should, sis. How are you? Everything alright? - Besides you being late. - Yeah, sorry. Oh, well... we already know it's not... -...one of your strong points. - Sorry. Why didn't you bring your girlfriend? Which one? The latest. The South American actress, was it? Laura. Yes, she's from Venezuela, ma'. Right, Laura. Are you still seeing her? Like all the others. Good. l'm glad, son. She's a charming girl. Yes, charming, ma'. You should start looking for a woman to marry. - Marry? Me? - Of course. Ma', you know l don't have any plans. -...to marry anybody. - Oh, dear! You should think about being a father. And making me a grandmother. Alright, give him time. He just hasn't found the right woman. So what? And if l can't have children like Ignacio, then what? Don't be silly, man! So the future of this family depends on me? Jesus! l feel so proud! Excuse me. l'll go open Gonzalo's bottle. Excuse me. And wash those filthy hands. Yes, ma'. Maria, take that to the dining room and serve it. Gonza, not here! Want me to come and fuck you good? Tell me. Want that? Maria, begin preparing the dessert. Yes, ma'am. Maria, may l have a glass ofwater, please. Was it good for you? Just good or very, very good? Very good. How's Ignacio in the sack? Let's say he's... -... SO-SO. - That means he sucks. When we met, he wasn't like that. He was a good lover. Or maybe l didn't know what a good lover was like. That's more like it. But now it's a disaster. l have the feeling... ...he only does it because he has to. And when he does, his head's somewhere else. You know why? Because l think he doesn't like women. Why do you say that? Don't know. l think he's a repressed fag. Are you serious? Yes... ...although l know he'll never accept it. Why do you say that? lntuition. Sheer intuition. Tell me the truth. Your 'gay-dar' never fails. Thanks, but... Let's see-- The truth, the truth, the truth... The truth is l don't think your husband... ...is a closet gay. No. To me... ...he's a crazed fag locked up in his granny's dusty trunk with seven locks. Poor thing! l feel sorry for him, because l can't imagine when he'll come out of that closet... ...of that trunk, in there where he's locked up. But how? Why do you say that? Because sleeping with you and not wanting to screw you every day, to me, seems... ...it's a crime. A crime, my dear. An unmentionable crime. He doesn't like to make love to me. No, no, no. l'm talking about fucking. Real, honest-to-God-fucking. Riding, humping, shagging, as they say. And if your husband doesn't want to fuck you... ...either he's really a fag or he's impotent. No, not impotent. That he isn't. l know that for a fact. Well, you're right about that. l know it too. What? No, not the way you think. Don't be silly. l'm just kidding. How can you even think...? Ready, sir. That was the last one. l don't know why the last one always hurts the most. - Aurorita, give me a massage. - Of course, sir. Shit! What do you say we leave the massage for another day? - Alright. - l'll call you. - Fine. - Thanks. Mariana, didn't l tell you no interruptions? You st_ me up, man. Weren't we going to have dinner once a week? Oh, you forgot! No, don't worry. it's okay, man. l told you not to sweat it, man. But l will send you the bill, okay? Bye. May l have the menu, please? And a bottle of whisky, blue label. - Right away, sir. - Thanks. What did you do? What's that? You said you wouldn't wax your back anymore. l don't like it, Zoe. lt makes me feel older. Besides, l want to be attractive for you, babe. You didn't think there was another woman, did you? lgnacio, l need to ask you something. Yes, sweetheart? Have you ever been with a man? Yes. l was with one today. An engineer from the factory. We were together, checking out the machinery we want to buy. Don't get cute. You know what l mean. No, l don't know what you mean. Have you ever... ...had sex with another man? No. Never. Why do you ask me that, honey? So you've never had sex with a man? l already told you. l don't like men, Zoe. l like you. And l thought you'd ask me something serious. - Promise you're not gay. - God! Zoe... ...don't be silly. l don't have to promise anything. - Promise. - Alright, l promise. Zoe... ...you are the love of my life. No one else. Now go to bed. You're in a bad mood. Gonza? Hey. Fine. l made a decision. l wrote him a letter. Maria... ...will you carry my bags to the car, please? Yes, ma'am. Fuck! Who is it? What do you want? You're an asshole, Gonzalo. l love you too, mothe_ucker. You're a son-of-a-bitch! Hope Ma' doesn't hear you. How could you tell Zoe l was a fag? Don't touch me, man! ls that your problem? You and your fucking paintings! Don't touch my painting, or l'll kick your ass. Don't! Don't you dare call me a fag again, asshole. Don't you dare. l forbid you to see Zoe again. You hear me? What is it you want? To destroy my marriage? Is that it? Who the fuck d'you think you are to tell my wife l'm a fag? Who do you think you are? l only told her the truth, man. I You think l don't remember asshole? - What are you talking about? - You know pe_ectly well... ...what l'm talking about, you fag. Tell me what you see here. Nothing. What do you see here, huh? What you see there is that little boy's world, man. A boy who's full of fear. He's totally manipulated... ...because his older brother wanted it that way, man. l remember pe_ectly when you said ''Close your eyes, dude... ...and think about the girl you like the most''. And when l finally got to be with a woman... you know what's the first thing l thought of? You, man. You, you fucking faggot. You molested me! And l looked up to you, man. You were my idol. l did everything... And now you come here whining about stum. Fuck you, asshole! Get out of here! Get out of here! You're sick, Gonzalo. Stay away from my wife. Zoe! Fuck! Gonzalo, you son-of-a-bitch. Son-of-a-bitch! l told Gonzalo l couldn't get pregnant. - You lied to him! - No, l didn't. l thought l couldn't. You must believe me Boris. Alright. l believe you, sweetie. And now what? l'm sure you want to have your baby anyway. l think l do. But... ...what if Gonzalo doesn't? lf you want, you can have it on your own. l wouldn't like my child to be fatherless. Right. lf you want your child to have a father... ...no problem. l can be the father of your child. Just like that. Just like that. Me too, me too. l mean, l adore myself. Would you really be willing? Of course, sweetie, of course. We admire the way he's developed... -...his market. - Mainly because... ...he did it when so many... -...factories were closing. - That's why we want... ...you to participate... ...inourcompanies. Participate. Yes. What is it exactly you want? You want my--? My advice or my capital? lt's obvious that someone as well informed as you knows we've had capital problems-- Excuse me for a moment. Excuse me. Could you tell me if Ms. Zoe Edwards... -...is staying in this hotel? - May l have her name again? Edwards. But you said you couldn't get pregnant. So l thought. Gonza, It's a miracle that l'm pregnant. A miracle? Are you out of your mind? What if it's in your head? How can you be so certain that you are pregnant? Come on. l did three tests, they were all positive. Jesus! For the love of God, man! Those tests are shit, man, they're just shit. What will you do? Damnit! And you haven't slept with anybody else? No. How do you know Ignacio' s not the father? - Ignacio shoots blanks. - Says who? The same doctors who said you can't have kids? Don't fuck with me. lf you're pregnant, which l doubt because those tests you took are useless... ...you have two choices. Either you tell Ignacio he's the father... ...or you get rid of it. An abortion? ls that your advice? Either that or you tell Ignacio he's the father. Those are your two choices. You don't care it's yours, do you? How can that be? How the fuck do l know it's mine, huh? You lied to me. You said you couldn't get pregnant and now you want to have a child with me. Well, go screw yourself! Don't call me. Don't look me up, l don't want this ever mentioned again. Once l leave this room you don't know me, got it? Yes? Good morning, Ms. Berkley, this just came for you. - Thanks. - Excuse me. Congratulations, Ignacio. Don't be afraid, Zoe. l'll be discreet. No one can forgive me. Don't say that. We're all sinners and God always forgives those who repent. l'm pregnant. Shouldn't that make you happy? Haven't you and Ignacio tried for years? Yes, but... ... Ignacio' s not the father. Who is it? l can't tell you. Tell me everything, Zoe. Or God won't forgive you. l can't. My guess is you haven't considered an abortion. God wouldn't forgive that. Human life is sacred. You must have that child. lgnacio will kill it. Tell him it's his. Tell him God works miracles. lgnacio and l go a long way back... ...he's a very kind, noble soul. He'll believe you. ln fact, Zoe... ...this goes against my ethics... ...but l empathize with you. You can solve your problem here. Call them but don't mention me.
