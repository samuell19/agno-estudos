SILENT GUNPOWDER Starring Well done! Well done! In the name of Serbs and Greeks, let's eat! We defended ourselves thanks to God and our poor people. Podgorina will not surrend! Salute to our people's hero, our commander lieutenant Milo? Radeki?! Salute! God help! God help you! Head to head, scapula to chieftain! You are just laying, eating and toasting since the time we raised mutiny and banished our enemies. Commander Radeki?, against main headquarters' directive will not go with his army in war. That is right. That is what I called to headquarter. I knew it, commissary, that you called them since you sent your messenger. There's shooting all around us. Serbian villages are burning in front of our noses. Don't you see that? I see and I hear. And why shouldn't we help them? Commissary, my army will not go anywhere. We've banished our enemies. They don't touch us, we won't touch them, and Bosnia is calm. But Bosnia isn't calm, there's shooting from all directions! Then we will wait. We won't wait any longer. Uro?, leave. And you too Janja. Radeki?, we will no longer wait. I will move the army as party assigned. And party's needs are law for everybody. This party is my commissary far away. That is why am I here. Yes you are, you are her eyes and ears. You see what you want to see, you hear what you want to hear. Radeki?, the headquarters will know the truth. So let them know. Commissary, listen. You will not command my army as long as I'm commander. We will see about that. Drink with us commissary. I don't drink. You don't want to celebrate with army? This is no army. Don't talk like that commissary. You are for, as they say: When is drinking - step foward, when is fighting - step back. If that's so commissary, then let us go home. You can't go below Red Flag. You can only desert. God, help Serbs to unite. Commissary! What do you want!? They killed commissary! Hello comrade commander. - Hello, Spaniard, I called you. You have to go to Podgorina, there's been revolution. Watch your eyes on Radeki?, he can prevail on Chetniks' side any minute. He is guilty for this mess. Well, this man is capable for any filth. I will not give you any advice, you will command on your own. In fact, do it as you think it's best. I understand, comrade commander. For your escort I assigned Zunzara and his squad. Hello. - Hello. Look, the best way to deal with the people is: When you can - be nice... When you can't - be sharp. But exterminate the traitors without mercy. Do you understand me, comrade? It's not my first time. Take the discipline, hire the guns, they traitorously killed commissary Vlada. Silent gunpowder - no gunfire, no smoke. That's waiting you there my Spaniard. Goodbye. - Goodbye. This is Gu?evo, Radeki?'s capital. Welcome, my name is Mladen. The commander of headquarters' squad. Where is Radeki?? He is at home, cutting logs, working all day. We are at war and he is cutting logs? Hello Radeki?. I hope that we will successfully cooperate. Of course. From now on I will take full duty of commander. By whose order? By main headquarters' order. Whose headquarters? Comrade Mrki. You will be my assistant. I must check. Check what? That I'm guilty for commissary Vlada's death? So are you? No. Then who killed him? Hate, like everything it kills. Now I understand why have you withdrawn and isolated. Local commander, local army. They are protecting their villages, their home properties. Why would they mind us for protecting this little what we have? You are like your neighbour Duke Trivun. I don't have any business with him. And that's exactly it! Only a few steps from us is raging some kind of chieftain, and you say: "He's not on our territory". Why we have to take care of the whole white World? Heh, what's this? Is this a coop or headquarters' house? Ha, girl? I am not a girl I am a widow. And I don't know why chickens bother you? Whose daughter are you? Priest's. Why? Why are you looking me like that? Nothing... nothing... nothing... nothing. Sit down Spaniard, warm yourself. I don't want to. Why don't you turn on the lamp? Who turned on the lamp so early? I did. We get petroleum down in Town, we have to save. No, I will not eat. How come? We are all gonna eat. I can't eat from my hands. We don't have enough dishes. We could wait each other. Polenta can't wait, it can't be heated again. Then I won't need anything. We get dinner equauly, no exception. You gonna eat like all us while you are here. Verry well. You are right. I brought teacher. Hello. My name is Stojan Keki?. So you are the elder of this village? I liked that too, village decide who's where and if somebody don't want teacher will. Sit, sit. You tell me now, who killed commissary Vlada? Believe me we don't know. You don't say? While you celebrate, eat and sleep your winter dream, they kill your commissary. Anyone could killed him, everyone carries a knife. Everyone carries it but not everyone is using it. How many traitors were killed under your command? What do you mean by that? Well Radeki?, for you and your Keki? here in Podgorina don't exist those who (sigh) wait their King. We have such kind too, it's understandable. Duke Trivun and his company. We will visit Trivun at the dawn. Where are we now? This is the road to Mra?ak. Is it safe? Depends for who. For you it is, you were born here. They are warning us to stop. So do we stop? As you want, you are in command. We are both commanders, my companero. Let's not die in vain Radeki?, there will be more opportunities to play heroes. Uro?, give your gun to Zunzara. Head to Duke, they won't shoot at you they know you. Tell him I want to talk to them. I understand. If he agrees, wave with your hat. Hurry. Don't worry mister commander. What commander? Isn't Radeki? their commander? The new one arrived. Commie? I don't know what kind is he, my Duke. What he want? To negotiate. Parliamentarian? Let them come. Verry well, let them come. You give your word? Did they say to you to ask that? No no no, I asked for myself. Tell them that Duke Trivun has gave his word and that he will not cross it. Go on. God help! Hello. I am Duke Trivun Drakuli?, this is headquater Superintendent Captain Raji?. With who do I have the honour? With Podgorina Partisan Commander. This is my deputy. I know Radeki?. Your name? Spaniard. Birth name, the one that church gave you. You will not tell? No. Very well. As you like. Captain, entertain the guests. You will not see this here, neither do I know who and what you are, neither do you have honourly name and you want this to be under your command. Not under my command, but under the command of main headquarters. If your main headquarters is for Russia and Spain and the whole world, for me it isn't. I have my own Commander General Dra?a and my King in London. We will meet again. Listen! If you come here again, you will not return alive. Let's go. Let's go! Heh, I'll get you Spaniard, sooner or later! Let's go. What are you writing? I'm writing a report. You will not tell the truth. What truth? That you sent us a mad man, and that will quicky come to your heads. Sending commander to enemies. You abate too much. You have to eat, drink this milk. Take off your scarf. Take it off. Why? So I can see your hair. Why are you hiding this preety hair? Are you commander to this army? Yes I am, priest. What are you doing man? It's holy to us to celebrate the God on heavens and peace among the people of good will. Bell is the celebration of ressurection. And who will ressurect my dead friend? God will punish those who did that. Your God is slow my priest, we are faster. From now on, the enemy will not gather anymore under this bell. If these people are your enemies who are your friends!? Turks didn't removed this bell and now you are removing it! Shut up, who asked you anything!? Zunzara! We came here to make revolution, not to pray to God. And how will I serve my God!? With honour priest, with honour. With God and Gods justice you have finished you last pray my red commissary. What are you saying? I say that now is the time for God to show on who's side is he. It's not on God to decide, it's on humans. Commander! What is it? The messenger has arrived from the main headquarters, he's with Spaniard now. I have met him down the river. He says he has personal mail for his new commander. Why don't you banish all of them from our Podgorina? We don't need other business. We just watch our bussines. I have noticed that people are walking away from us since you let them take our bell. I know with who I have business. I heard that messenger arrived. Yes. And what did Mrki say? Something... for me. Everybody out! You too, Zunzara. You are all working behind my back, hiding your plans. And if tomorrow trouble strikes, you communist will flee first! Devil knows where to? To Russians? Again Milo? Radeki? is alone with peasants. He has nowhere to run! It can't be like this anymore! Listen Radeki?, don't say that rubbish again! Have you ever seen communists fleeing and not defending the poor? Ha? That's how much you know too, isn't that right Milo?? I know. What do you want then? I want to know and it's my business to know what's the news from the headquarters. And it is. People are worried to see you with these ranks on you. Why are these ranks bothering someone? It bothers you, they won't let you see that the King's Army has failed and that you are creating a new army. They won't let you believe us. You don't believe me, that's the point. I gave you all! What else must I do for you to believe me? What? You want this!? There! Milo?, you will burn from schnapps. I could not drink anymore. Schnapps doesn't burn me, but something else, priest. You can't get over the ranks, I know. I can. I earned them with hard work and half of my life. I took ranks not from me, but from these people, and I don't know where am I leading them and who with. It's hard without them. It's hard without them, you can't without them. They are strong, tough, organized and Russia is with them. Mother Russia. Podgorina is singing songs like Russia. Where will they lead us, priest Novak? God sees. God has forgotten us. Eat, comrade Milo?. I see. Now I'm comrade, you are comradess. I removed my ranks, you removed your blackness. Last year. She was widow one year. Blackness isn't guarding her, her soul is. Where are you going my daughter? To the headquarters, to give them food. Brothers and friends, here in Gu?evo and in whole Podgorina we are fighting not only the occupier, but we're fighting for our own authorities, too. Teacher, we don't want any new authority here. We had enough of old Yugoslavia who peeled the skin of our back. That's right! That's right! Hold on people, but this is not old authority. Tell that to someone else every authority is the same. We have our own authority lieutenant Radeki?, and you nicely took his ranks! We want Radeki?! Where is Radeki?!? We want Radeki?! I'm giving you my honour word what nobody will take Radeki? off. Yesterday he was commander, today deputy and tommorow? Darkness will swallow him tommorow if it isn't already. Give us Radeki?! Let him hold the gathering. We want Radeki?! We want! Where is he!? People! Radeki? is my war friend, my deputy! And who is defending him from me? Long live Spaniard! Long live! The one who removed ranks from our Radeki? should pay now in front of whole village. That's right! Come on! We didn't come to fight for our house and for our cow! We are fighting for one cow who will give milk to all us. How big will tits be then? He speaks, he speaks in political view. I know it's political, so it's a lie. There is no such cow in the world. People! Today we will select "The Committee for the Liberation of the Peoples" of the village. If you need committee you pick it on your own. We don't need it, we have it! I will rise Porgodina on her feet! You heard Keki?. You heard how kulaks speaks to Teacher. What kulaks, people of God? Uneducated world, what do they know? It's good to talk to them but not on gatherings. They act like heroes, making jokes. You need to talk to them nicely, privately. Zunzara. You are right, Keki?. With who should we talk privately? The hardest one is Vlajko Krleka, his brother is with Duke Trivun. Then, old Zuban. He is big rowdy. Then there is Luka, you know him. He is rowdy too, poor bastard. Thank you Keki?. I will listen to your advices. Krleka, open up! Don't shoot brothers, it's me! So you are the one that talks that we live from stealing and that we should be banished? You would slaughter us with pointless knife? I wouldn't slaughter anyone. What about commissary? It wasn't me. Neither do I know else could it be, by the cross I swear. Speak! Who killed commissary? I watch my own business. You watch your business while we spit our blood. Heavenly Sun, for who are we dying!? Nodoby called you to die for us. Go from where you came! Zunzara. You Keki?! Keki?! For Gods sake, don't kill me. We don't kill anyone in the name of God. Commander! Commander! Teacher wants you, he won't come in. You are the one? - Yes I am, commander. And you need to protect us as soon as possible. I have heard all. - I can't go on any further. How come? - My born brother, I can't. I think Milo? that they have gone too far towards us peasants. There are rumors that Spaniard is preparing the army to destroy mines, to attack railways and cities. They wanted from Serb to give up his army, church, priest. And now you are killing us. It would be better that party didn't arrived here in the first place. We should all be left alone, to meet our own fate. Those who survive should lead elderly life. Like their ancestors. What's wrong with you Stojan, you seem depressed. And how could I not be, Milo?? Spaniard want whole Podgorina to follow his footsteps. Where is he and where are we? He will destroy us and himself. And what will we do if he is right? I don't know that Milo?. The one thing I know that he is accusing wrong people. How can I look in people's eyes? Has it come that far? I can't take it anymore. I am leaveing Milo?. Only God knows where. Commander. It seem that Spaniard can't touch you. Just name it, our brothers will take him down. This is the last time you said that! Open up. They have beaten you like hell. Like hell. Spaniard, Spaniard, I swear to you with St. George that you will pay with your head. Lord O Mighty. Good. What is going on, Spaniard? Greas that up. And what have you heard? People are affraid they won't live next dawn. And I waited for you to come out from your house and to see what is going on. It can't be like that Spaniard. That's not our path. And which path do you want? We will achieve nothing with this, we're just gonna kill our people. Our numbers will be reduced to brigands group. This peasant army should move from home to battle. Remember Radeki?, there is no revolution without killing. I know that! But I will not allow for my people to be suspects, to be draged from their home to be killed without trial. You forgot that commissary was killed without trial? For one head, how many more will you take down? I don't count enemies. Is one commissary worthy of all that blood? It's worthy Radeki?, it's worthy. Because I'm next. This is my battle too, Radeki?. I'm afraid this battle is yours only. Zunzara! Saddle the horses. What's this, Mr. Commander? Something is going on. The whole world is against us. Who's that "us"? Against you and me. You go as you want, as you must. But I will no longer stand still. We will wait, my Uro?. Because only God knows what will be. Spaniard don't care for our fatherland, he cares for Russia. He will spread our bones throughout the foreign land. We will see. Things are not doing well for us, Trivun. To who's that? To all. To you and to them in Gu?evo. I am your older brother. And listen to me: The great enemy attacked us. You should join forces with Gu?evo not against them. You said that to me like 100 times! And again I say it will not end well! And I tell you for good: mind your own business, Lazar! Duke! It's begun. Volunteers came! Where are they from? - From Gu?evo. Heroes, God Help! We serve to our King and homeland! And you will serve, you will serve. Enough have you served to those red devils. And where are you from? My name is Vlajko Krleka, I have barely escaped them, once we beated them. Well Done hero! Zunzara is arresting, they are beating and killing people. Let them do. Yes it's a pity, but nevermind. Let them arrest them, let them beat them up, let them kill them, let them gut them, Until they see that they are dealing with deserters of monarchial state, flag, King and homeland. With those that neither home, woman, church, nor bell are sacred. And what happened to Radeki?? He retreated in his home and he's silent. As I said Duke, Radeki? is an honest man. Screw that honour when he's not using that honour. Why doesn't he decide on which side is he already? Commander without army, Officer with no rank! Nodody knows who is Radeki?. Guard! Feed them. Zunzara, Zunzara, Zunzara! What are you doing man? I know this people better than you. It don't seems like that priest. They will fight for you 'cause you have the power, but don't touch what's theirs. What's from God and what can't you give to them. That's enough priest! You are stong, you have great power and you think that you are unstoppable. You've said enough. Is that right? That's right, priest. What are you waiting for? Pick up you stuff and go. Leave her alone, she is a free woman. I'll tell you something too, you human filth. You are so young yet so filthy. You're guilty as much as your grandfather. Don't hope for good before God and people. Priest, that was your last word! - Don't! We will see who will have the last word, you hear me? You say to your boss that we have where and who to die from, we don't need foreign executors for that. You remember that. Zunzara. Organize the army, we are moving soon. Attention! Petroleum! Sound the alarm! Alert! Help us people! God, save this Home and this people. Go. What do you want? To see commander. - Why? I will say that to him. Lay down your weapon! Did you give it to me? - No I didn't, but I will take it. I've been looking for you comrade Spaniard. And you have found me. It nearly happened that we haven't met for the second time. I was supposed to kill you at the gathering. Why? - They gave me the gun and ordered me. Who? Duke Trivun and his men. So why am I still breathing? Why to kill a man who is fighting for this people? You rather take me in your squad. I don't want to have any business with Chetniks. One more thing. Watch yourself. They are waiting for you. Welcome. Zunzara, gather the army! And you are some squad commissary! Your commander left, enemies are gathering in you field and they killed your messenger. And you do nothing? - I did, I work the best I can. I arrested Knez, Mlinar and Trivun's brother who only knows about Trivun. And? - They are silent. They won't tell who is in connection with Duke and who is alarming the village and squad. Take me to them. Listen! Look at me! I know that you know all. I don't have time for you. I've been in your prisons. And I felt on my skin their method of questioning. We don't do that. This is revolutionary court. Question and answer. Those who don't tell the truth will meet his own fate. And the penalty is only one. Who amoung you is Knez? Sir, I was Knez but when the war started... I'm not sir to you just answer me... and shortly. Who killed the messenger? Let dear God kill me if I know. This is the last time I ask. I don't know. Take him. Just take him! Who is Trivuns brother among you two? I am. You, Radeki? and my brother are smart man. Instead of making troose you made us suffer. I ask you: who killed the messenger? It could be my crazy brother, and if could be you. Take him. Wait, just wait! - Take him! Wait! - Shut up! And now you. I was never against you, against the old authority and against the new. Ours. But you know who killed the commissary and the messenger? Answer me! I know who killed the messenger, but I don't know who killed the commissary. I will tell you. Luka killed the messenger. Luka is dead! - Yesterday I saw him with my own eyes. Why didn't you told me that earlier? I mind my own bussines. I'm afraid of them like I'm afraid of you. So you are neutral? - And neutrals are on our side. Why you say that? Tell me, tell me! I mean... please, please don't. Take him. Please don't, please. Don't. I am nobodies. Be prepared for tommorow evening. I can believe that you killed commissary Vlada. I had to because he was a communist. Let me tell you something, commander. You have betrayed King, homeland and you will betray Serbian people. God will punish you for colaborating with communists. You are hiding your past like the snake is hiding its legs. I don't hide my past, I have forgotten my past, comrade Janja. I would like to know which Devil is pushing you. I am a soldier. Take him, and don't take eyes of him. What did he do? - I will hear. What is going on? Do you know whos gun is this? How should I know? Gun of commissary Vlada. Where did you found it? I found that at the person who killed him. What have you done!? Did he confess? - Yes he did. But there is something more important. There isn't. Spaniard! Or what your name is, listen to me. Listen to me carefully: You have punished Uro?, he's guilty. People will understand that. But don't kill random and blindly. Who is killing blindly? You. What have you done with those three people? What? I have executed three Chetniks' helpers. If we cleaned Podgorina earlier they wouldn't kill us. This revolution wouldn't be held on by the peasant politics. I know Radeki? that people don't teach them with terror. You see that 5th column is suspicious. Firfth column isn't suspicious, you are. Who's "we", comrade Radeki?? Headquarters, foreigners, gentlemens, you! I'm for you "sir"? You are, if you want. Spaniard! If you call one of your hitmen, I'll first take fire and you're closest to me. Milo? Radeki?, stand still! You are a soldier that's an order! By the main headquarters' decision, I am taking you off your duty of deputy commander. Go to your home and don't move until further orders. So that's how is gonna be? Don't talk like that, talk like soldier! I understand. Get up! What's with you Svetko, are you crazy? I had enough of your commissary job. Get up! You can kill me, but the squad will kill you, our comrades will... You don't have comrades and squad anymore. Get out! What's this, comrades!? A mutiny!? Give me that! Remove his red star hat! Take these savages to the basement, tie the commissary, take this! Faster! Faster! Push them! Brothers and sisters, you know I can't talk so kitschy like Partisan commissars. But look! Look what has done Spaniard and his gang. Look to who commander Radeki? has sold you, the officer who broke his officer's oath and betrayed our fatherland. Shame on him! Bring the commissary! Attack! Commissary, why did you kill my brother!? Speak! Brothers, give him trial! People anger is best judge. Kick him! - Don't do that! Bring communists here! Here! Get them inside! Inside! Oh Lord, what is this? Satan has come in this unreasonable people! Lord, give smartness to all us! There you are, mourn them as long as you like! May your soul be eternal, Duke Trivun! They are all God creature! Why you kill inossent people? Go away! Go away! (Girls singing song to Radeki?) You are leaving? I don't have any options. I must. But I will be back. Will you return alone, son? We will see. Good luck to you son. Zunzara! Zunzara. Ahahaha! I will get you, sooner of later! Brothers, to the forests. Christ has ressurected and I wish happy day to you all. That is true, he ressurected, thank you priest. Christ has ressurected. - That is true, he ressurected. Christ has ressurected. Happy day to you. Christ has ressurected. Hello priest, you can't live without us. I can't live without people and without Church Bells. Tommorow I will lead this people and you take your bell. Christ has ressurected, commander. Spaniard! Take your weapons and muster the horses! Get him! Comrades, get the killer! Your mind is drifting. Do you see something we don't see? We can't go on with you. Radeki? didn't hold on. Leave. You will die here. And you want me to leave. Mladen, assemble the people. Squad, assemble! Come on, faster! Come on comrades, come on. Hello Mrki. - Hello Spaniard. Attention! Greet your main headquarters' commander. Hello! Hello comrades. What are you doing in our hive? - Your former deputy commander brought me here. You survived? It was near. It's good. But it's not good when they fire secretly on commander. Welcome. People, let's start. You are, comrade Spaniard, now under the party committee. From when is Milo? Radeki? member of party? He isn't. But he will be. By main headquarters' order he is now commander of Podgorina squad. So it's degregation? It's more serious than that. You are in suspision for breaking the rules of the 2nd degree of the Revolution. And you know what that means? - I know. This commiitee if founded by request from the people of this area. It's Milo? Radeki? request. Spaniard don't interupt me until i ask the question! Sit down. Who gave you the authority to burn villages and kill people without any trial and investigation? Revolution gave me that authority. Revolution? This isn't October. This isn't your Spain either. This is mountainous Bosnia. How you think we should lead this People's Liberation War if people don't follow us? How would you like? To take working class from your pockets? That's sort of fruit doesn't grow in Bosnia my young fellow. Your squad is formed from the peasant moles and Chetniks who we backed up from railways, and from those like Milo? Radeki?. Why don't they shoot him? Answer me! You won't speak? Or you don't have anything to say? I'm the old member of the party and I am waiting for decision. Very well. That is good. You don't have anything to say, do you? No? Now you two go and wait outside. My best friend betrayed me in Spain. Two days after, he died. He sold me for two days of life. A dead man has betrayed me. I must admit to you that... For mistakes in political and military guidance and taken actions presented to you, the party committee is punishing you by baning from Communist Party of Yugoslavia. As the chief commander of the headquarters, I order you to hand over the duty to commander Radeki? and I'm sending you to main headquarters. You will wait for me there until I come back. I understand. Come on, let's go talking now like the old friends do. Come. Tie that. So this is goodbye, comrade commander? You are leaving right now? Right now. Which way will you go? The shortest way, across Mra?ak. They are shooting there every hour, watch yourself. At least bring someone. I wlll go alone. You are leaving? I must. Go. Go say goodbye to your father. The man comes, unknown to us in Podgorina, to lay down in this cold mountain. Where are his relatives to mourn him? If such kind have relatives at all. He has relatives, I am his widow. You know him and whole village know him, I am carrying his child. God gives, my daughter, sin on my soul. Honoured volley, fire! Weapons down! Glory to a hero, comrade Spaniard. Glory! On your right arm, to the left, squad forward, march!
