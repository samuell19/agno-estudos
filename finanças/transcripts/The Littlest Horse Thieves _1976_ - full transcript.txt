YOUR MOTHER WILL HAVE YOUR TEA READY. BERT. AYE? BEST GET THE BOYS OUT OF SIGHT-- THE GAFFER'S COMING. OH. Dave: WHO'S THE GAFFER? THE NEW MANAGER. HEY, NOW, COME ON, LET'S HAVE YOU OUT OF HERE.

MM-HMM. ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT, MR. CARTER. CARRY ON, BERT. TIME'S MONEY. RIGHT, SIR. Mr. Sandman: WHICH WAY NOW, CARTER? Carter: WE'RE GOING WEST. FLASH-- PAST HIS TIME? HE'S NO BUT A LONDON FELLA. HE DOESN'T KNOW MUCH. I'LL, UH, I'LL JUST GET SOME TOBACCO. RIGHT. CHEERIO, AMOS. SEE YOU TOMORROW. HELLO, LOVE. HELLO, LASS. HAVE YOU SEEN THE BOYS? AYE, THEY'RE JUST GIVING BERT A HAND WITH THE PONIES. OH, NO, NOT AGAIN. WILL THEY BE HOME FOR THEIR TEA? HOW SHOULD I KNOW? THEY NEVER SPEAK TO ME. ONE FOR YOU... AND ONE FOR YOU. GO ON, LADS, OFF WITH YOU. THANKS, BERT. THANKS, BERT. CARTER! SIR? WHO WERE THOSE BOYS? BOYS, SIR? YES, THERE WERE TWO BOYS. THEY CAME OUT OF THE PIT. OH, THEM BOYS. IT'S DAVE AND TOMMY SADLER. THEY HELP THE HORSEKEEPER WITH THE PONIES. THEY'RE TOO YOUNG TO BE ON THE PAYROLL. WELL, THEY JUST... BERT GIVES THEM A PENNY NOW AND THEN. THEY LIKE TO DO IT. APART FROM ANYTHING ELSE, THERE'S SAFETY REGULATIONS TO BE CONSIDERED. THEY HAVE NO BUSINESS TO BE GOING DOWN. NO BUSINESS? THEIR FATHER DIED DOWN THERE. DAVE! THAT'S GOOD FOOD YOU'VE GOT THERE. BE THANKFUL FOR IT, AND DON'T GOBBLE IT UP AS IF IT WAS NOTHING. AND WHERE DO YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING? I'M GONNA TAKE DANNY OUT FOR A RUN. A BIT LATE, ISN'T IT? WE ALWAYS USED TO TAKE DANNY OUT LAST THING. YES, BUT YOUR -- NOT ALONE. CAN WE GO? OH, GO! GO, WHY DON'T YA?! COME ON, TOM. DANNY, COME ON. I'LL HAVE SOME MORE TEA. HE'S BACK! HE'S BACK! IS HE, DEAR? THAT'S NICE. Man: HELLO, MY DEAR. OH, FATHER, I THOUGHT YOU'D NEVER GET BACK. CLARA AND I HAVE UNPACKED ALL THE PICTURES. WE'VE DONE WELL, HAVEN'T WE? VERY WELL. I SEE YOU PUT THE CURTAINS UP. MOTHER AND CLARA DID THAT. OH, WELL DONE, CLARA. THANK YOU, SIR. MOTHER'S PUTTING THE BEST CHINA AWAY. SHE WOULDN'T LET ME HELP. SHE SAID I MIGHT DROP IT. DID SHE? HELLO, DEAR. HELLO. YOU'RE BACK. YES. CLARA, YOU CAN SERVE DINNER NOW. THE MASTER'S HOME. ALL RIGHT, MUM. THAT GIRL... I WISH SHE'D CALL ME "MADAM." "MUM" IS SO VULGAR. WELL, I'VE BEEN BROUGHT HERE BY LORD HARROGATE TO MAKE HIS COLLIERY PAY, AND I'M GOING TO DO IT. AND IF I DON'T, HE'LL CLOSE DOWN THE PIT, AND THEN I SHALL LOSE MY JOB... AS WELL AS THE MINERS' LIVELIHOOD. WHAT EXACTLY IS THE PROBLEM, DEAR? ALICE, DO DRINK YOUR SOUP QUIETLY. THE REAL PROBLEM IS THAT WE CAN'T GET THE COAL OUT IN SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES. AND THEREFORE, IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE. AT THAT PRICE, WE CAN'T SELL IT. THAT'S WHY THEY HAD TO STOP THE NIGHT SHIFT. WHAT WILL YOU HAVE TO DO, FATHER? WELL, FOR A START, I SHALL TRY AND GET RID OF THOSE PIT PONIES. COME ON, TOM, I'LL RACE YOU TO THE TOP! THAT'S NOT FAIR -- YOU STARTED OFF FIRST! DON'T WORRY-- I'LL WAIT FOR YOU WHEN I GET THERE. OH, NO, YOU WON'T! I'LL BEAT YOU YET! SEE IF I DON'T. BYE, DADDY. GOODBYE, MY DEAR. HAVE A NICE DAY. ALICE! ALICE, WHERE ARE YOU GOING? JUST GOING TO FLY MY KITE, MOTHER! DON'T GO TOO FAR. I DON'T LIKE HER GOING UP IN THE MOORS ALONE. WELL, IT'S A BIT LONELY FOR HER HERE. I DON'T WANT HER PLAYING WITH ANY OF THOSE ROUGH MINERS' CHILDREN. I SHALL BE GLAD WHEN THE GOVERNESS ARRIVES TO KEEP HER OUT OF MISCHIEF. WELL, GOODBYE, DEAR. HMM. I DO HOPE HIS LORDSHIP IS AGREEABLE. YES, SO DO I. UH, MR. SANDMAN TO SEE LORD HARROGATE. HIS LORDSHIP IS EXPECTING YOU, SIR. NOW, THEN, SANDMAN, WHAT DO YOU PROPOSE TO DO ABOUT THIS COLLIERY OF MINE? WELL, LORD, ONE OF THE PROBLEMS IS THAT-- UH, NO, THANK YOU-- IS THAT EMSDALE IS A SMALL COLLIERY, AND THE SEAM IS A LONG WAY FROM THE SURFACE. YES, YES. I KNOW ALL ABOUT THAT. BUT THE POINT IS THAT IT DOESN'T MAKE A PROFIT. NOW, KIRKDALE'S COLLIERY MAKES A PROFIT, BUT MY COLLIERY DOES NOT MAKE A PROFIT. IN FACT, MY COLLIERY KEEPS LOSING MONEY. NOW YOU, AS MY NEW MANAGER, TELL ME, WHAT DO YOU PROPOSE TO DO ABOUT THAT? I'D LIKE TO EXPLORE THE POSSIBILITY OF USING MACHINERY IN THE PIT, MILORD. MACHINERY? ARE YOU SUGGESTING WE MIGHT USE MACHINERY INSTEAD OF MINERS, PERHAPS? UM, WELL, NO, MILORD. BUT IT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE TO BRING THE COAL FROM THE FACE TO THE SHAFT BY MEANS OF MACHINERY INSTEAD OF PONIES. HMM? WELL, YES, YES, AT LEAST I'M -- I'M PREPARED TO EXPLORE THAT IDEA. HMM? LOOK INTO THAT FOR ME, WILL YOU, SANDMAN? AND FIND OUT ALL ABOUT THE COSTS, AND SHOW ME THINGS, LIKE PLANS AND SO ON. YOU KNOW, THAT SORT OF THING. I WILL, MILORD. MY GOODNESS, JUST LOOK AT THOSE RABBITS ALL OVER THE LAWN SIMPLY RUINING IT. Alice: GO AWAY! GO AWAY, YOU HORRIBLE DOG! GO HOME! IT'S A GIRL UP A TREE. AYE. COME ON. GO AWAY, YOU HORRIBLE DOG! WHAT ARE YOU DOING UP THERE? GO AWAY! CAN YOU GET DOWN? YES! OF COURSE I CAN. NO! COME ON. I WANT MY KITE. YOU DON'T WANT MUCH, DO YOU? YOU BEST GET YOURSELF DOWN FIRST. COME ON-- THAT'S THE WAY. GO ON-- DOWN A BIT MORE. BE CAREFUL! WHY DID YOU PUT YOUR KITE IN A TREE? I DIDN'T DO IT ON PURPOSE. I CAN'T RUN FAST ENOUGH TO GET IT UP IN THE AIR PROPERLY. DAVE COULD. PULL, DAVE, PULL. IT'S NEARLY THERE. RUN FASTER, DAVE. Dave: THERE IT GOES -- I CAN FEEL THE WIND TAKE IT. COME ON, KITE. COME ON! OH, DAVE, IT'S FLYING! YOU'VE DONE IT! OH, WELL DONE. OH, LET ME HAVE A GO, PLEASE. HERE YOU ARE. THANK YOU. WHY AREN'T YOU IN SCHOOL? WHY DO YOU THINK? SUMMER HOLIDAYS. YOU'RE LUCKY-- I'VE GOT A HORRIBLE GOVERNESS COMING, AND SHE'LL WANT TO STAY INDOORS ALL DAY DOING LESSONS. WHAT'S A GOVERNESS? SHE'S A SORT OF TEACHER, AIN'T SHE? WHY DON'T YOU GO TO SCHOOL LIKE US? BECAUSE IT'S A COLLIERY SCHOOL, AND SHE'S A LADY. I'M NOT A LADY! OH, YES, YOU ARE. I'M NOT A LADY! I'M NOT! I ONLY SAID YOU WERE A LADY. HOW DARE YOU CALL ME THAT? TAKE THAT BACK! NOTHING WRONG WITH THAT. YES, THERE IS-- THE WAY YOU SAID IT. WATCH WHAT YOU'RE DOING. YOU'LL TEAR YOUR DRESS. I DON'T CARE! I'M NOT A LADY! TAKE THAT BACK! STOP IT! THAT'S ENOUGH! WHAT? LADIES DON'T FIGHT. Alice: I WONDER WHAT IT'S LIKE DOWN THE PIT. HAVEN'T YOU EVER BEEN DOWN? WE GO DOWN ALL THE TIME. YOU CAN'T. YOU'RE TOO YOUNG. BOYS AREN'T ALLOWED TO WORK DOWN THE MINES UNTIL THEY'RE 14. WE DON'T WORK, EXACTLY. WE HELP BERT WITH THE PONIES. THE PONIES?! YOU HELP WITH THE PIT PONIES?! YES. WE GO TO THE STABLES NEAR EVERY DAY. WE HELP LOOK AFTER THEM. YOU'LL MISS THEM WHEN THEY'RE GONE, WON'T YOU? GONE? THE PONIES! MUM, THE PONIES! NOW, WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN? THE PONIES! WHAT ABOUT THE PONIES? THEY'RE GONNA GET RID OF THEM. THEY'RE PUTTING MACHINERY IN INSTEAD. WHAT'LL BECOME OF THE PONIES?! WHAT WILL THEY DO WITH THEM?! WHAT CAN THEY DO WITH THEM? NOBODY'S GOING TO PAY FOR THEIR KEEP IF THEY CAN'T WORK. COME ON, SIT DOWN AND HAVE YOUR TEA. WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO THEM? HOW SHOULD I KNOW? BE THANKFUL IT'S ONLY THE PONIES THEY'RE GETTING RID OF AND NOT THE MEN. OF COURSE, YOU WOULDN'T CARE! YOU'RE THE ONE THAT LEFT MY FATHER IN THE PIT! YOU GOT OUT YOURSELF AND LEFT HIM TO DIE! LUKE! DAVE... ...HOW COULD YOU SAY SUCH A THING TO HIM? I DON'T CARE. HE HAS NO RIGHT TO BE HERE IN OUR HOUSE. IT'S HIS HOUSE NOW. HE WORKS ALL DAY DOWN THAT PIT TO KEEP US IN FOOD AND CLOTHES, AND YOU-- I DON'T WANT HIM HERE. NOR DO I. WHAT DOES IT MATTER WHAT YOU WANT?! GO TO BED, BOTH OF YOU! YOU CAN GO WITHOUT YOUR TEA! PERHAPS THAT WILL TEACH YOU TO REMEMBER WHO EARNS IT FOR YOU. I BROUGHT YOU SOME BREAD AND MILK. COME ON. TA. IF HE'S ASLEEP, YOU EAT IT ALL. SHOVE OVER A BIT. DAVE, YOU KNOW LUKE DIDN'T LEAVE YOUR FATHER. YES, HE DID. NO, HE DIDN'T. LUKE WAS INJURED IN THE FALL, AND YOUR FATHER WENT IN TO RESCUE HIM. THEN THE SECOND EXPLOSION CAME. I KNOW... BUT LUKE COULD'VE DONE SOMETHING TO HELP HIM. HE WAS BROUGHT OUT UNCONSCIOUS. WHAT COULD HE DO? GOD BLESS. WELL, THAT'S THE LOT. THE REST OF MY MEN WILL BE HERE ON SATURDAY. RIGHT. I WISH I COULD GO DOWN AND SEE THE PONIES BEFORE THEY GO. GIRLS AREN'T ALLOWED DOWN THE PIT. NOR ARE BOYS. BUT YOU GET DOWN, AND I'M BIGGER THAN YOU ARE. BUT NOT MUCH. ALICE! NO, ALICE, YOU CAN'T. MORNING, BERT. MORNING, BOYS. HI, BILL. GOT SOME SPARES? THERE YOU ARE. THANKS. SIR? IF I SEE THOSE BOYS GOING DOWN AGAIN, YOU'LL BE DISMISSED. WATCH IT. AND JESTER AND BERTIE AND BLUEY. AND YOU KNOW WHICH ONE THIS IS? NO. THIS IS FLASH. FLASH? FLASH! WATCH IT! HE'S NOT USED TO STRANGERS. HE MIGHT LASH OUT. OH, FLASH, YOU WOULDN'T HURT ME, WOULD YOU? SEEN THE MACHINERY ON TOP? MACHINERY? THEM BIG CRATES WITH THE ENGINEERS FROM SHEFFIELD. POOR BEASTS--THEY WON'T BE HERE MUCH LONGER. THAT'S WONDERFUL. WONDERFUL?! WHAT DO YOU MEAN, "WONDERFUL"?! IF THEY'VE NO MORE WORK FOR THEM, THEY'LL BE BROUGHT UP OUT OF THE MINE AND LET OUT INTO THE FIELDS. WE CAN GO VISIT THEM EVERY DAY AND FEED THEM AND LOOK AFTER THEM. FLASH, AND JESTER, AND BLUEY, AND ALL OF THEM. THEY'LL BE ABLE TO RUN ABOUT IN THE SUNSHINE AND BE HAPPY AND SAFE. THAT'S WHAT YOU THINK, IS IT? ASK THEE FATHER. ASK THEE FATHER WHAT WILL BECOME OF THE PIT PONIES. FATHER! MOTHER, DO YOU KNOW FA-- Mrs. Sandman: ALICE... ALICE... THIS IS MISS COUTTS. SHE HAS COME TO BE YOUR GOVERNESS. HAD YOU FORGOTTEN SHE WAS ARRIVING TODAY? HOW DO YOU DO, ALICE? DEAR ME, WE ARE MISS GRUBBY PAWS, AREN'T WE? I'M AFRAID WE HAVE RATHER LET HER RUN WILD. NEVER MIND, MRS. SANDMAN. I'M SURE WE SHALL SOON GET ALICE BACK INTO LADYLIKE WAYS AGAIN. WHEN WILL FATHER BE HOME? I WANTED TO ASK HIM-- ALICE! WHERE ARE YOUR MANNERS? MISS COUTTS WAS JUST GOING UPSTAIRS. WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO WITH HER AND SHOW HER THE SCHOOLROOM? WILL THEY REALLY PUT THEM IN THE FIELD AND LET THEM RUN ABOUT? YES, OF COURSE THEY WILL. THEY'LL LIKE THAT, WON'T THEY? AYE, THAT THEY WILL. GOOD NIGHT, TOMMY. NIGHT, DAVE. Dave: THERE, FLASH, WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT? SEE THE SUNSHINE, FLASH? LOOK-- THERE'S GRASS AND TREES. Alice: BLUEY, OH, BLUEY. YOU'LL LIKE IT HERE. THEY ALL LIKE IT. COME ON, FLASH, SANDIE, JEWEL, JESTER, SOLDIER. COME, STAR-- FLASH WILL SHOW YOU THE WAY. ...AND NO TUBS TO PULL, NEITHER. THEY'RE FREE, AREN'T THEY? THEY'RE FREE. FLASH, YOU'RE A BEAUTY. AND YOU CAN RUN ABOUT AS LONG AS YOU WANT... Clara: * I SHOWED MY LOVE A CHICKEN THAT HAD NO BONE * * I TOLD MY LOVE A STORY THAT HAD NO-- MORNING, CLARA. MORNING, LOVE. * I SHOWED MY LOVE A BABY... MOTHER, I MUST SEE FATHER. DO YOU KNOW IF HE'LL BE HOME FOR LUNCH? ALICE, DEAR, YOU MUSTN'T BOTHER HIM. HE HAS A LOT ON HIS MIND. AND, YOU KNOW, LITTLE GIRLS SHOULD BE SEEN AND NOT HEARD. BUT I MUST ASK HIM SOMETHING! WELL, ALICE, PERHAPS I CAN TELL YOU WHAT YOU WANT TO KNOW. IT'S ABOUT THE PONIES. PONIES? THE PIT PONIES. FATHER'S BRINGING MACHINERY INTO THE MINE TO DO THE WORK THE PONIES USED TO DO, AND I WANT TO KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO THEM. WELL, I SUPPOSE, IF THEIR USEFULNESS IS FINISHED, THEY'LL HAVE TO GO. BUT GO WHERE? MOTHER? WELL, I SUPPOSE-- I DON'T REALLY-- I'M SURE YOUR FATHER WILL HAVE MADE PLANS FOR THEM. BUT WHAT PLANS? WHAT WILL BECOME OF THEM? WELL, IF THERE'S NO WORK FOR THEM TO DO, I IMAGINE THEY'LL BE SENT-- SENT WHERE? TO THE SLAUGHTERHOUSE. NO! NO, FATHER WOULDN'T DO A THING LIKE THAT! ALICE! RUNNER! RUNNER! WELL, WHAT'S GOING ON HERE, THEN? THEM ENGINEERS CAME AT HIM WITH A BIG BALE OF WIRE AND FRIGHTENED HIM. THAT WIRE CABLE'S GOT TO BE LAID. WE CAN'T WORK WITH THEM AND THEIR GEAR ALL OVER THE PLACE. YOU'LL HAVE TO GO HOME THEN, WON'T YOU? WHAT, AND LOSE OUR MONEY?! ALICE? COME ON. WHAT'S UP, ALICE?! WE'VE HAD TO STOP WORK, SIR, IN THE LOWER DRIFT HEADING. OH THEY CAN'T WORK WHILE THAT CABLE'S BEING LAID. ALICE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? I WANTED TO ASK YOU SOMETHING. NOT NOW, DEAR, I'M BUSY. COME ON, CARTER, SHOW ME EXACTLY WHERE THEY'VE STOPPED. NOW, THEY'RE LAYING THE CABLE HERE. Carter: THAT'S RIGHT, SIR, AND THERE'S THE LOWER DRIFT HEADING. Mr. Sandman: YES, I SEE. SEND THE MEN HOME, THEN, SHALL I? OH, YES, VERY WELL. ALICE, YOU RUN ALONG. I'VE GOT A LOT TO DO. PLEASE, FATHER. ALL RIGHT. WHAT IS IT YOU WANT? IT'S ABOUT THE PIT PONIES. WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO THEM? ALICE, I HAVEN'T GOT-- PLEASE, FATHER, I WANT TO KNOW. WELL, I CAN HARDLY TURN THEM LOOSE ON THE MOORS. THEY'RE NOT USED TO FENDING FOR THEMSELVES. ISN'T THERE A FIELD SOMEWHERE, SO THEY CAN LIVE HAPPILY AND RUN ABOUT AND ENJOY THEMSELVES? WHO'LL PAY FOR THEIR FEED? THE COLLIERY OWNER. THEY WORK IN THE COLLIERY. YOU CAN HARDLY EXPECT LORD HARROGATE TO PAY FOR ANIMALS TO DO NOTHING, ANYMORE THAN MEN. WELL, THEN WHAT WILL BECOME OF THEM? THEY WON'T... BE SENT TO THE SLAUGHTERHOUSE, WILL THEY? FATHER... RUN ALONG HOME. WHY AREN'T YOU WITH YOUR GOVERNESS? I'VE GOT ENOUGH ON MY MIND WITHOUT BEING BOTHERED ABOUT A LOT OF PONIES! WHAT IS IT, ALICE? WHAT'S THE MATTER? THE PONIES... HE'S GOING TO KILL THE PONIES. THERE'S ONLY ONE THING TO DO. WE'LL HAVE TO STEAL THEM. STEAL THEM? YOU MEAN GET THEM OUT OF THE MINE AND KEEP THEM SAFE? OH, YES! HOW WILL WE DO IT? I DON'T KNOW. BERT CAN HELP US. NO. YOU'RE NOT TO MENTION IT TO BERT. BUT YOU SAID -- I WAS WRONG. HE MIGHT TELL LUKE. LUKE LIKES THE PONIES. HE'D BE AFRAID OF LOSING HIS PLACE. COULDN'T WE COME IN ALONG AT NIGHT AND WIND THEM UP? NO. SOMEONE WOULD HEAR US. BESIDES, THERE'S ALWAYS PEOPLE ABOUT DOING MAINTENANCE IN THERE. THEN HOW CAN WE GET TO THEM? THERE MUST BE ANOTHER WAY IN. THERE'D BE SOME OLD WORKINGS. MIGHT BE A WAY OF GETTING IN THROUGH THEM. HOW DO WE KNOW WHERE THEY ARE? THEY ALWAYS KEEP PLANS OF ALL THE WORKINGS. WHERE? IN YOUR FATHER'S OFFICE. CARTER! WHAT'S GOING ON, CARTER? Carter: YOU BETTER COME OVER, MR. SANDMAN, UNLESS YOU WANT THE WHOLE PIT STANDING IDLE. WHAT'S GOING ON? YOUR MAN TELLS ME I CAN'T TAKE THIS STUFF DOWN PIT. I WARNED YOU TIME AND TIME AGAIN, NO NAKED FLAMES DOWN THERE. YOU GIVEN ME FOUR WEEKS TO FINISH THIS JOB. IF I CAN'T DO... ...ANY DELAY AS OF YESTERDAY. FIRMLY PROMISED. IT SHOULD BE SOMEWHERE HERE. YES, BUT WHERE? LET'S LOOK UP HERE. LOOK! LOOK, I'VE FOUND IT! COME ON! WATCH YOURSELF! THAT COULD'VE BEEN YOU. THAT SHOULD BE THE OLD ENGINE HOUSE THERE. LET'S SEE. AYE, IT'S A WINDING ENGINE. YOU KNOW, FOR WINDING THE GAUGE UP AND DOWN. THEN IF WE CAN GET IT WORKING, WE CAN BRING THE PONIES UP. FATHER, HOW DOES A WINDING ENGINE WORK? ALICE, DEAR, THAT'S HARDLY A SUITABLE SUBJECT FOR A YOUNG LADY. MISS COUTTS, I WANT MY DAUGHTER TO BE A YOUNG LADY AND TO LEARN FRENCH, AND SEWING, AND WATERCOLORS-- BUT I ALSO WANT HER TO TAKE AN INTEREST IN THE THINGS ABOUT HER. SO, ALICE, IF YOU'D LIKE TO COME TO MY STUDY, I'LL SHOW YOU HOW A WINDING ENGINE WORKS. THANK YOU, FATHER. THIS SHOULD GO IN THERE. NO, IT SHOULDN'T. YOU'RE DOING IT ALL WRONG. NO, I'M NOT. WHAT DO GIRLS KNOW ABOUT MACHINERY? YOU CAN'T PUT THIS IN THERE. ANY FOOL CAN SEE THAT. TRY LIFTING IT UP AND PUTTING IT IN. NOW ALL IT NEEDS IS SOME GREASE. HELLO, TOMMY. WHAT DO YOU WANT? IT'S A BIG ENGINE, AIN'T IT, HARRY? AH, IT'S A BIG ENGINE. IT'S GOT A LOT TO DO. HARRY! AYE? WHAT DOES IT HAVE TO DO? YOU KNOW WHAT IT DOES. IT RIDES THE GAUGE UP AND DOWN AND PUMPS THE WATER OUT. WHERE DOES THE WATER COME FROM? I DON'T KNOW WHERE THE WATER COMES FROM. EVERYWHERE, I SUPPOSE. IF YOU DIDN'T PUMP THE PIT OUT EVERY DAY, IT WOULD SOON BE FLOODED. HARRY! AYE? GOODBYE, HARRY. HEY, WE BEST NOT GET TOO MUCKY, OR THEY'LL WONDER WHERE WE'VE BEEN. DAVE... COME AND LOOK. I THINK I'VE PUT ENOUGH ON. IT MUST WORK! IT MUST! THAT VALVE -- TURN IT THE OTHER WAY. I TRIED IT. IT DOESN'T HELP! WHAT'S GOING ON HERE, THEN? TRYING TO GET THE OLD ENGINE TO GO, ARE YOU? WELL... WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO WHEN YOU GET IT GOING? WE'RE GOING TO GET THE PONIES UP. OH, TOMMY... UP OUT OF THE PIT, ARE YOU? AND HOW DO YOU THINK YOU'LL DO THAT? THROUGH THE OLD WORKINGS. YOU'RE GONNA GET THE PONIES UP OUT OF THE PIT? YOU, TOMMY, AND THE LITTLE MISS? IF ONLY WE COULD GET THE ENGINE TO WORK. SHOULDN'T BE TOO HARD. IT'S NOT SO LONG SINCE IT WAS RUNNING. FIRST, CLEAR THE SHAFT HEAD. COME ON, GET IT UP. RIGHT, BERT! HERE YOU ARE, THEN. YAY! HA HA! YAY! YAY!YAY! WE DID IT! YAY! YAY!YAY! I SHOULD RUN IT UP AND DOWN A FEW TIMES TO WORK THE GREASE IN. BUT NOT FOR TOO LONG -- SOMEONE WILL HEAR IT. WELL, I MUST BE OFF TO THE STABLES. YOU'LL NOT TELL LUKE, WILL YOU? ME? I'LL NOT TELL ANYONE. NOW, MIND, I'VE NEVER SEEN YOU HERE, AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING. I'LL GO DOWN TOMORROW AND TRY TO FIND A WAY THROUGH THE PRESENT WORKINGS. AND THE STABLES? AYE. IF YOU GO DOWN TO OLD WORKINGS BY YOURSELF, YOU'LL GET LOST. NO, I WON'T. YES, YOU WILL! OH, GIVE OVER! YOU WILL GET LOST! MISS COUTTS, I THINK I WOULD LIKE TO LEARN TO CROCHET. REALLY, DEAR? I THINK I HAVE A SPARE BALL OF THREAD HERE. TA. ALL RIGHT. GOOD LUCK, DAVE. AYE, GOOD LUCK. ALL RIGHT, TOMMY. MY DAD DIED DOWN THE PITS. WAS IT AN EXPLOSION? I'VE HEARD MY FATHER TALK ABOUT FIREDAMP. THAT'S A SORT OF GAS, ISN'T IT? AYE. IT BUILDS UP. AND THEN YOU GET A SPARK AND IT GOES UP. YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN IT'LL HAPPEN. COME ON, FLASH. COME ON, LAD. COME ON, FLASH. WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU? GO ON, LAD. THAT'S IT, THAT'S IT. HOW FAR WILL HE HAVE TO GO TO GET THROUGH TO THE PRESENT WORKINGS? HARD TO SAY. THEM LEVELS RUN FOR MILES. MOST LIKELY, HE'LL GET LOST. TOMMY! HIS CANDLE WILL BURN OUT, AND HE WILL WONDER ABOUT IN THE DARKNESS UNTIL HE FALLS EXHAUSTED, AND LIES THERE UNTIL HE'S CLEMMED TO DEATH -- NOTHING LEFT BUT A "SKELINGTON". Mrs. Sandman: ALICE... ALICE? MISS COUTTS, WHERE'S ALICE? WELL, SHE-- I'M AFRAID ALICE HAS BEEN GIVEN RATHER TOO MUCH LIBERTY, MRS. SANDMAN. BUT I THOUGHT SHE WAS IN HERE WITH YOU. WELL, UM... I WENT FOR MY LITTLE NAP AFTER LUNCH, AS USUAL, LEAVING HER HERE WITH HER CROCHETING. CLARA TELLS ME SHE WENT OUT FOR A WALK. BUT WHERE IS SHE NOW? TOMMY... AYE. I... I'M GOING DOWN. YOU MUSTN'T! I'M GOING TO! I'M SURE HE'S LOST. YOU HAVEN'T GOT A CANDLE. YOU'LL GET LOST AS WELL. IT'S HIM! GO! I KNEW YOU COULD DO IT! DAVE, DID YOU GET THROUGH? WHAT DID YOU FIND? DID YOU GET LOST, DAVE? OF COURSE NOT. WE CAN GET RIGHT THROUGH TO THE COALFACE WHERE THEY'RE WORKING NOW. I SAW OLD FLASH. HOORAY!HOORAY! Dave: WE COULD BRING THEM HERE. Alice: DON'T PEOPLE WORK HERE ANYMORE? ONLY A SHEPHERD IN WINTER WITH HIS SHEEP. THE LEAD MINERS USED TO WORK HERE, BUT THEIR PIT'S BEEN CLOSED FOR YEARS. HUH? YES, THIS WILL BE THE BEST PLACE TO KEEP THE PONIES. NO ONE WILL EVER SEE IN. NOW, THEN, THERE'S SOME FODDER IN THE BARN BEHIND THE PITHEAD. WE CAN GET IT UP HERE, AND THEN -- THEN WE CAN KEEP THE PONIES SAFE FOREVER. AYE! I'LL SHUT THE DOOR. DAVE... HUH? I'M SORRY ABOUT YOUR FATHER. BERT SAYS THE PIT BELONGS TO HIM... AND TO ALL THEM THAT DIED THERE. Miss Coutts: ALICE! ALICE! QUICK, RUN! ALICE! ALICE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING OUT HERE? WHO WAS THAT I SAW WITH YOU? UH...JUST SOME BOYS. THEIR...THEIR FATHER OWNS THE MINE. REALLY? YES. YOU MUST INVITE THEM HOME TO TEA ONE DAY. OH, THEY WOULDN'T COME. YOU MEAN BECAUSE YOUR FATHER IS ONLY THE MANAGER OF THE MINE? ALICE, DEAR, YOU MUST REMEMBER THAT TO THE TRUE ARISTOCRAT, ALL MEN ARE EQUAL. YES, MISS COUTTS. Violet: COME ON, LOVE. YOU'LL BE LATE. WHERE'S MY BAIT, THEN? IT'S READY. DAVE... THEY'RE CONNECTING UP THE MACHINERY TODAY, AND TOMORROW THE PONIES WILL BE BROUGHT UP AND SENT TO BARNSLEY. THIS'LL BE THEIR LAST DAY IN PIT. IF YOU WANT TO GO DOWN AND SEE THEM, I'LL MAKE IT ALL RIGHT WITH SAM CARTER. NO, THANKS. I'M NOT BOTHERED. DON'T YOU WANT TO SAY GOODBYE TO THEM, DAVE? NOT EVEN OLD FLASH? THEY'RE ONLY PONIES. POOR BEASTS-- THEY DON'T KNOW THEY'RE HAULING THAT TO THEIR DEATH. AYE. WELL, WHAT DO YOU DO, BERT, AFTER THE PONIES HAVE GONE? I'VE NOT THOUGHT. YEAH, THERE'LL BE NO PLACE FOR ME AT EMSDALE THEN. I'LL HAVE TO TRUDGE AND LOOK FOR A JOB. AYE, AND SOME OTHERS, TOO, I SHOULDN'T WONDER. AYE. SAM, ANY WORK FOR ME AND MY MATE TOMORROW? MIGHT BE, LUKE. DEPENDS HOW THEM ENGINEERS GET ON. YOU BEST TURN UP AND SEE. ARE THEY BRINGING IN MACHINERY TO CUT COAL, SAM? HOW MANY OF US WILL BE PUT OUT OF WORK? NONE, I HOPE. LOOK, THE MANAGER SAYS-- WHAT WAS THAT? HAVE THEY JUST STARTED UP MACHINERY DOWN BELOW? AYE. BUT I THOUGHT THAT CAME FROM OVER THE HILL. GO ON, TOMMY, MORE COAL. ISN'T ALICE COMING? SHE SHOULD BE HERE. AYE. SHE SHOULD. HAS ALICE GONE TO BED ALREADY? SHE'S NOT ILL, IS SHE? I DON'T THINK SO. SHE JUST SEEMS TO BE VERY SLEEPY TONIGHT. OH, WELL, I'LL JUST SAY GOOD NIGHT. DAVE! SORRY I'M LATE. THAT'S ALL RIGHT. HERE, YOU CARRY ON STOKING. I'M GONNA SEE TO THE ENGINE. THEM ENGINEERS HAVEN'T GOT THEIR MACHINES WORKING UP THERE, HAVE THEY? NAH. UP AT FACE. IT SOUNDS FURTHER AWAY THAN THAT. THAT'S A WINDING ENGINE. Bert: AYE, IT'S A WINDING ENGINE. I SHOULDN'T WONDER. I'VE HEARD IT BEFORE. IT COMES FROM THE OLD WORKINGS. AND YET, IT'S BEEN BLOCKED OFF SINCE FIVE MEN WERE KILLED THERE. AYE, THAT'S TRUE. NAY, I'D NOT GO NEAR THAT FOR £100. I'D BE AFRAID OF HOBGOBLINS DRAGGIN' ME DOWN INTO OLD WORKINGS. YOU'RE AN OLD WOMAN, BERT. HOBGOBLINS, INDEED. COME ON, LADS. COME ON. OFF YOU GO, FLASH. HE ALWAYS KNOWS WHEN HIS SHIFT IS OVER. IT'S OVER THIS TIME WITH A VENGEANCE. THAT'S THE END OF THE PONIES. WHOA, FLASH! DAVE, DON'T LOSE HIM! WHOA, FLASH! WHOA! WHOA, FLASH! THEY'VE NEVER BEEN AS LATE AS THIS BEFORE. YOU DON'T THINK THEY'VE RUN AWAY, DO YOU? NOW, WHY SHOULD THEY DO THAT? YOU KNOW WHY. I'M GOING TO LOOK FOR THEM. THAT'S THE LAST. COME ON, TOM. LET'S GET THEM INTO THE CAGE. WE'LL NEVER GET THEM INTO THE CAGE. THEY'RE NOT USED TO IT. YES, WE WILL. COME ON, FLASH. COME ON. COME ON. GOOD LAD. COME ON, FLASH. GOOD BOY. GOOD BOY. RING THE BELL, TOM. RING THE BELL AGAIN, TOMMY. OH, WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH HER?! SUPPOSING SHE CAN'T WORK IT-- WE'LL BE STUCK DOWN HERE, WON'T WE? WE'LL BE STUCK DOWN HERE WITH THE PONIES UNTIL THERE'S NOTHING LEFT OF US BUT "SKELINGTONS." WANT SOME HELP, THEN? OH, BERT! Dave: THERE, FLASH. YOU'RE GONNA LIKE THIS. COME ON, LAD. COME ON. FLASH! COME ON. COME ON, FLASH. COME ON. COME ON. FLASH! WHAT'S THE MATTER, FLASH?! Bert: IT'S ALL STRANGE TO HIM. HE'S NOT BEEN UP ABOVE GROUND FOR 14 YEARS. HE'LL LIKE IT WHEN HE GETS USED TO IT. YES. YOU TAKE HIM. I'LL GO DOWN AND GET THE OTHERS. COME ON, FLASH. GO ON, FLASH. IT'S OKAY. IT'S OKAY. COME ON, FLASH. COME ON, FLASH. COME ON, BOY. YOU'RE ALL RIGHT, FLASH. LOOK. LOOK WHERE YOU'RE GOING. DON'T BE AFRAID. WE'RE NOT GOING TO HURT YOU. IT'S ALL RIGHT, FLASH. IT'S ALL RIGHT. COME ON, FLASH, THIS WAY. Mr. Sandman: HELLO, LOVE. HELLO, DEAR. HOW DID YOUR MEETING GO IN SHEFFIELD? WELL, NOT TOO BAD. YOU LOOK TIRED, DEAR. YOUR SUPPER'S ALL READY. AH... WELL, I'LL JUST LOOK IN ON ALICE. WELL, HAVE YOUR SUPPER, FIRST. SHE'S SOUND ASLEEP. YES, ALL RIGHT. CLARA! Clara: I HEARD YOU, MUM. TOMMY. AYE? DO YOU THINK YOU CAN TAKE HIS BRIDLE OFF? OF COURSE I CAN. COME ON. ALICE? BLUE WAS THE LAST ONE. WE'VE GOT THEM ALL UP. GOOD. Tommy: STAND STILL, BLUEY, CAN'T YOU? YOU BETTER GO AND HELP HIM WITH THAT HARNESS. RIGHT. YOU'LL HAVE TO MANAGE NOW, I'M OFF. DON'T TELL ME WHERE YOU'RE GONNA PUT THEM. I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU. AND IF ANYONE ASKS ME, I DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY ARE. I SHOULD GET THEM AWAY FROM HERE, IF I WERE YOU. SOMEONE MIGHT HAVE HEARD THE ENGINE. NIGHT. COME ON! WE MUST GET THEM TO THE HIDING PLACE--QUICKLY! DO YOU THINK THEY'LL FOLLOW US ACROSS THE MOORS? YES, OF COURSE THEY WILL. COME ON, FLASH. WE'LL GIVE THE LEAD. COME ON, FLASH. WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU? COME ON, FLASH. COME ON, PONY. COME ON, NOW. COME ON, PONY. Alice: IS FLASH ALL RIGHT, DAVID? Dave: YES, OF COURSE HE IS. KEEP UP, TOMMY, CAN'T YOU? COME ON, LION, SOLDIER, SANDIE, COME ON. BLUEY! HE HAS TO STOP. COME ON, BLUEY. COME ON, FLASH. EMILY! EMILY! WHAT IS IT? WHAT'S HAPPENED? ALICE ISN'T-- MISS COUTTS! Mrs. Sandman: RICHARD! MISS COUTTS! OH, MR. SANDMAN, I'M SORRY-- HAVE YOU SEEN MY DAUGHTER? NO, SIR. IT'S THE PONIES, SIR-- THEY'VE GONE. COME ON, FLASH. COME ON, FLASH, IT'S ALL RIGHT. WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH FLASH? I DON'T KNOW. I-IT MUST BE AFTER BEING BELOW ALL THOSE YEARS. EVERYTHING'S SO STRANGE TO HIM. HE'LL LIKE IT WHEN HE GETS USED TO IT, WON'T HE? YES. WE DID IT, DIDN'T WE? WE SAVED THEM. AYE! FATHER... YOU WON'T TAKE THE PONIES AWAY... WILL YOU? TAKE HER HOME, MISS COUTTS. WHAT'S UP? NAY, COME ON. COME ON, MY LITTLE LAD. WANT SOMETHING TO EAT? YOU BEST GET TO BED, THEN. DAVE... GO ON... GO UP TO BED. THEY'RE READY, MR. CARTER. OH, RIGHT, JOE. NOW THEN, GET THIS STRAW OUT OF THE WAY! CLEAN THE RAMP, QUICK AS YOU CAN. ALL RIGHT, LADS, DON'T HANG ABOUT HERE. CARRY ON UP TO THE PIT AND GET BELOW, EH. NOW, THAT NEW MACHINERY MIGHT TAKE A BIT OF GETTING USED TO, BUT YOU CAN WORK A FULL SHIFT, AND WE'LL JUST SEE HOW WE GET ON, RIGHT? BERT, GET THEM PONIES LOADED UP. TAKE OLD FLASH UP FIRST, THEN THE OTHERS WILL FOLLOW. LEAVE THEM PONIES WHERE THEY ARE! YOU WHAT? BERT, GET THEM PONIES LOADED. I SAID LEAVE THEM! LEAVE THEM BE! LISTEN, LADS... THEM PONIES HAVE SERVED US WELL-- HELPED US TO WIN COAL AND EARN OUR LIVING. WILL YOU LET THEM BE TAKEN OFF TO BE SLAUGHTERED, LIKE THEY WAS SO MUCH RAW MEAT? YES? WELL, WHAT IS IT? Carter: LISTEN!! Mr. Sandman: WHEN I GIVE AN ORDER, I EXPECT IT TO BE OBEYED! GET THOSE PONIES BACK TO THE STATION, PUT IN THE VANS. Luke: THEM PONIES BELONG IN THE PIT, SAME AS US! AYE!AYE! AYE!AYE! ALL RIGHT! LOOK... THE PONIES HAVE BEEN REPLACED BY MACHINERY, WHICH WILL ENABLE YOU TO EARN MORE MONEY! WE DIDN'T EARN MORE MONEY YESTERDAY WHEN WE WERE LAID OFF! THERE'S BOUND TO BE A BIT OF DISLOCATION AT FIRST WHEN WE'RE CHANGING OVER-- FROM MEN TO MACHINES! NO, NOT FROM-- NOT--NOT-- THAT'S THE DISLOCATION! THEY'RE CHANGING OVER FROM MEN TO MACHINES! AND WE'LL NOT HAVE IT! WE NEVER ASKED FOR MACHINES! WE DON'T WANT THEM! WE'LL WORK WITH THE PIT PONIES, LIKE WE ALWAYS HAVE! IF NOT FOR THAT MACHINERY, THE PIT WOULD PROBABLY BE CLOSED AND YOU OUT ON THE STREETS AND PENNILESS! THAT MACHINERY IS HERE TO PROTECT YOUR LIVELIHOOD! AND IF YOU WEREN'T SUCH DAMNED FOOLS-- WE'LL NOT BE MISCALLED BY THE BOSSES! THAT'S RIGHT, WE WON'T. YOU CAN WORK YOUR OWN PIT, MISTER, WITH YOUR OWN MACHINERY, IF YOU THINK IT'S SO FINE! HEY, COME ON! Carter: WHERE DO YOU THINK YOU'RE GOIN', LAD?! YOU WANT TO LOSE A DAY'S PAY?! IT'S TIME AND MORE YOU WERE ALL ON SHIFT! COME ON, LADS, GET DOWN THERE! LET'S HAVE NO MORE OF THIS! WE'RE ON STRIKE, SAM! AND IF YOU PUT THEM PONIES IN THAT VAN, WE'LL NEVER COME BACK! NOW, THANKS TO YOU, I'VE GOT A STRIKE ON MY HANDS. NOW, I HOPE YOU'VE HAD TIME TO THINK OVER YOUR BEHAVIOR AND ARE THOROUGHLY ASHAMED OF YOURSELF. NOW, I'M NOT GOING TO PUNISH YOU, SO I HOPE IT WILL BE ENOUGH PUNISHMENT FOR YOU TO KNOW THAT I'M VERY ANGRY, AND I'M DISAPPOINTED IN YOU. AND I HOPE YOUR FUTURE BEHAVIOR WILL SHOW THAT YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'VE DONE AND ARE VERY SORRY FOR IT. WELL? WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO THE PONIES? YOU BETTER GO TO BED NOW. WILL THE UNION GIVE YOU THEIR BACKING? THEY MIGHT. THEN AGAIN, THEY MIGHT NOT. IF THEY DON'T, WE DON'T GET ANY STRIKE PAY. WHAT ARE WE GOING TO LIVE ON? DAVE, I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'VE GOT TO GRIN ABOUT. HAVEN'T YOU GOT ANYTHING BETTER TO DO WITH YOURSELF? AREN'T YOU GLAD THEY'RE NOT GOING TO KILL THE PONIES? PONIES. PONIES! I'M SICK AND TIRED OF PONIES! PONIES WON'T PUT FOOD IN YOUR BELLY OR CLOTHES ON YOUR BACK! COME ON, LOVE. AND AS FOR YOU, I -- I'M NOT HAVING YOU UNDER MY FEET ALL DAY. YOU CAN HAVE YOUR BREAKFAST TOMORROW, AND THEN GET OUT OF THE HOUSE. IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE ON STRIKE, YOU CAN GO AND BE ON STRIKE SOMEWHERE ELSE! WHEN DOES THE OWNER GET BACK, SIR? IN A WEEK'S TIME. THEY BETTER BE BACK AT WORK BY THEN, OR ELSE-- CAN'T HE SEE AT ALL? NO. THEY CALL IT ANTHRACITIS. IT'S INFLAMMATION CAUSED BY THE COAL DUST. A LOT OF OLD PIT PONIES GET IT. WHEN HE WAS DOWN UNDERGROUND, HE KNEW HIS WAY ABOUT, SO NOBODY NOTICED. STRIKE?! BUT WHAT THE DEVIL HAVE THEY GOT TO STRIKE ABOUT? I'M THE ONE THAT'S LOSING THE MONEY. HMM THEY BETTER BE CAREFUL, OR I'LL BEAT THEM TO IT AND GO ON STRIKE MYSELF FIRST, AND THEN THEY'LL BE SORRY, WON'T THEY YES, MILORD. YES. ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, WHAT'S THE TROUBLE THIS TIME? I SUPPOSE THEY WANT MORE MONEY, HMM? NO, MILORD. IT'S A QUESTION OF THE MACHINERY. THE MEN FEEL THAT IN REPLACING THE PONIES WITH -- MACHINERY? ARE YOU SAYING THEY'RE REFUSING TO USE THE MACHINERY? NOT EXACTLY, MILORD. IT'S MORE THAT THEY WANT ASSURANCES. SHH! SHH! SHH! SHH! SHH! SHH! SANDMAN, SANDERSON, PLEASE, PLEASE. SIT DOWN SOMEWHERE AND LISTEN VERY CAREFULLY TO WHAT I HAVE TO SAY. NOW, WILL YOU DO THAT? YES, MILORD. YOU SEE, I JUST SIMPLY DON'T CARE WHAT THEY WANT. THEY'RE HERE TO WORK, AND YOU'RE HERE TO SEE THAT THEY DO WORK. NOW, YOU TOLD ME THAT THIS MACHINERY WOULD, IN TIME, OR SHOULD, IN TIME, MAKE THE COLLIERY BEGIN TO PAY. GOOD. VERY WELL. ALL RIGHT. BUT, IF THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN, THEN I'LL HAVE NO ALTERNATIVE BUT SIMPLY TO CLOSE THE PIT ALTOGETHER AND USE THE LAND FOR SOMETHING ELSE. HMM? SHOOTING. ANYTHING. I DON'T CARE. NOT A BIT. BUT IF THAT HAPPENS, NOT A SINGLE MAN JACK OF THEM WILL HAVE A JOB... OR EVEN ANYWHERE TO LIVE FOR THAT MATTER. BUT IF I COULD JUST GO BACK TO THE MEN, MILORD, AND-- PLEASE, PLEASE, SANDMAN. I'M SORRY, BUT THERE'S JUST NOTHING MORE TO BE SAID. NOTHING AT ALL. WE WON! SO, IT'S TUPPENCE YOU'LL OWE ME, ALL RIGHT? ALL RIGHT, MY BEAUTIES. QUICKLY, ALICE, COME AWAY. THOSE DREADFUL MINERS. THERE THEY ARE ON STRIKE, AND THEY HAVE THE IMPUDENCE TO BE SEEN OUT HERE PLAYING WITH THEIR DOGS. YOU HAVE TO KEEP A WHIPPET EXERCISED. BESIDES, THEY HAVE NOTHING ELSE TO DO. Amos: HEY! WE'VE WON! HEY, WE'VE WON! SAM CARTER'S JUST PUT A NOTICE UP! THE MANAGER'S CALLED A MEETING AT THE PIT! QUICK, COME ON THEN-- WE'VE WON! WE'VE WON! COME ON! EITHER YOU COME BACK TO WORK TOMORROW, OR THE PIT CLOSES. FOR GOOD! NO, I MEAN WHAT I SAY! THE EMSDALE COLLIERY IS MAKING A LOSS! THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY FOR IT TO MAKE A PROFIT, AND THAT'S BY USING MACHINERY TO FETCH THE COAL OUT IN GREATER QUANTITIES AND SO, MORE CHEAPLY! I'VE OBTAINED AN OFFER FROM THE OWNERS OF A STEELWORKS TO TAKE ALL OF OUR COAL FOR THE WHOLE YEAR ON CONTRACT! BUT IT MUST BE CHEAP! THEN WE'D BE ASSURED OF WORK FOR A FULL YEAR? EXACTLY! WHAT ABOUT THE PONIES?! THERE'S NO PLACE FOR PONIES IN THIS PIT! COME ON, AMOS, THAT'S AN ULTIMATUM. WE CAN'T TAKE AN ULTIMATUM! AT LEAST MAKE TERMS! WELL, WE STRUCK FOR PONIES, BUT IT WEREN'T JUST THAT! WE STRUCK FOR A BIT OF RESPECT FOR US AND THE WORK! BUT IF THEY CAN TURN PONIES OUT WITHOUT A THOUGHT OR A WORD, THEY CAN TURN MEN OUT, TOO! IF WE GO BACK ON HIS SAY-SO WITHOUT MAKING TERMS-- HOW CAN WE MAKE TERMS?! IT'S A COLLIERY VILLAGE, AND WE LIVE IN COLLIERY HOUSES. AYE. IF THE PIT CLOSES, WE'RE OUT ON THE STREET -- ALL OF US-- AND OUR WIVES AND BAIRNS. WE'LL HAVE NO MONEY, NOWHERE TO LIVE, NO FOOD, AND NO WORK. AYE! NOWHERE TO FIND NONE, NEITHER. THERE'S NOT A PIT IN YORKSHIRE THAT HASN'T GOT SOME MEN IDLE. NAY, LUKE... IF COLLIERY CLOSES WE'RE DONE FOR, SO THINK ON. I SAY WE GIVE IT A CHANCE. IT'S AGREED, THEN-- WE GO BACK. WE SHOULD HAVE A VOTE! LET'S VOTE! THEM WHO WANTS TO GO BACK, AND THEM WHO WANTS TO HOLD OUT FOR TERMS! ALL RIGHT, THEN, WE'LL HAVE A SHOW OF HANDS! THEM WHO WANTS TO GO BACK TO WORK TOMORROW! THEM WHO'S AGAINST! MORNING. MORNING, VIOLET. ALICE, FATHER'S JUST GOING TO THE COLLIERY. AREN'T YOU GOING TO KISS HIM GOOD I SHALL NEVER KISS HIM AGAIN AS LONG AS I LIVE. GET IN! COME ON! Carter: GET THOSE PONIES LOADED! COME ON! WHAT'S GOING ON THERE? COME ON, BERT, GET THEM PONIES UP, DON'T YA? TAKE OLD FLASH UP, THEN HE'LL GIVE A LEAD. COME ON, GET A MOVE ON! COME ON! COME ON! BY NEXT WEEK, WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO DRIVE SOUTH FROM THE FORWARD HEADING. AYE. IT'S A PITY WE COULDN'T HAVE FOUND THE PONIES A HOME, SIR. WELL, IT WOULD HAVE MADE IT EASIER FOR THE MEN TO GO BACK WITH A GOOD HEART. THEY WOULD ONLY HAVE SEEN IT AS A SIGN OF WEAKNESS. man: OUT OF THE WAY THERE. MARTIN-- ONE OF THE ENGINEERS! WELL? THERE'S BEEN AN EXPLOSION, MILORD, AND A FALL IN THE DRIFT HEADING. WE DON'T KNOW YET WHAT CAUSED IT... AND, UH, EIGHT MEN CUT OFF IN THE FORWARD HEADING. WHO?! WHO ARE THEY? WHO'S THAT? MRS. ARMSTRONG, SIR. I'M SORRY, MRS. ARMSTRONG. I'M AFRAID THAT YOUR HUSBAND IS ONE OF THEM. AMOS, GO ON. BLESS YOU, BROTHER. Luke: NOUGHT. HOW'S THE LEG, AMOS? OH, HEY, HEY, DON'T TOUCH IT, LAD. ALL RIGHT, LAD, ALL RIGHT. IF THERE'S A BUILDUP OF AFTERDAMP BEYOND THE FALL, IT COULD BE DAYS BEFORE THEY GET THROUGH. AYE. CHEER US UP, WHY DON'T YOU? I'M GONNA TRY THE OTHER HEADING-- SEE IF I CAN HEAR ANYONE. ALF? MIND HOW YOU GO, ALF. ONE SPARK FROM YOUR BOOTS MIGHT BE ENOUGH TO SET IT ALL OFF. Mr. Sandman: WE THINK THEY'RE THERE, MILORD. I SEE. AND THERE'S NO WAY OF GETTING THROUGH TO THEM? WELL, IT'S NOT A VERY BIG FALL, AS FAR AS WE CAN JUDGE, BUT, UM, IT'S KNOCKED OUT THE MAIN VENTILATION SHAFT. AND, UH, THE AFTERDAMP IS VERY BAD. AFTERDAMP--THAT'S THE SUFFOCATING GAS? THAT'S RIGHT, MILORD. AND WHEN THERE'S FIREDAMP AND AFTERDAMP TOGETHER-- I KNOW, I KNOW--IT IGNITES. IT CAN DO. AND THERE'S NO OTHER POSSIBLE WAY OF REACHING THEM? NO, MILORD, AND IT MAY BE AS MUCH AS, OH, 48 HOURS BEFORE WE CAN GET THE VENTILATION -- WE'LL GET THROUGH TO THEM SOMEHOW. COME ON, LET'S GET GOING! I TELL YOU, YOU'LL BE SUFFOCATED 10 MINUTES AFTER YOU LEFT THE SHAFT BOTTOM! WE COULD GET IN THROUGH THE OLD WORKINGS, LIKE WE DID WITH THE PONIES! THEY GOT THE OLD WINDING ENGINE WORKING AGAIN AND ALL. WELL, I'M PREPARED TO TRY IT. YOU'LL NEVER FIND YOUR WAY THROUGH, SIR. AND WE CAN'T TAKE THE LAD DOWN. YOU'LL NOT BE ABLE TO USE ANYTHING BUT SAFETY LAMPS, BECAUSE OF THE DANGER OF FIREDAMP AFTER THE EXPLOSION, AND THERE'S NOT MUCH LIGHT FROM THEM. IN EFFECT, YOU'LL BE TRAVELING IN THE DARK THROUGH A PIT YOU DON'T KNOW. FLASH DOESN'T NEED LIGHTS! HE KNOWS THE WAY! ALICE! WHERE ARE YOU GOING? TO THE OLD WORKINGS, MOTHER. FATHER'S GOING DOWN AGAIN. COME NOW, THEN. MRS. SANDMAN, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO -- WITH ALL THOSE MINERS' WIVES. Mr. Sandman: IS THE PONY READY?! AYE, SIR. WELL, BRING IT UP THEN! LET ME GO DOWN WITH FLASH. NO. NO, IT'S OUT OF THE QUESTION. PLEASE, SIR. I'M AFRAID I CAN'T ALLOW IT, MY BOY. YOU STAY AND LOOK AFTER YOUR MOTHER. WE'LL GET YOUR FATHER OUT IF WE CAN. DON'T WORRY. I'LL TAKE FLASH DOWN. I'M HIS DRIVER. COME ON, FLASH. COME ON! COME ON. YOU STAY THERE, SON. COME ON, FLASH. GOOD BOY. WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH HIM? GET HIM IN -- QUICKLY! OH, HE'LL BE ALL RIGHT. COME ON, FLASH. COME ON. THAT'S A GOOD PONY. HE'LL BE ALL RIGHT. BACK HIM IN. BACK HIM IN. KEEP THE CANARY UP AT THE FRONT, SIR. IF THERE'S GAS ABOUT, HE'LL GIVE YOU WARNING BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE. RIGHT, HARRY! RIGHT! RIGHT. COME ON, THEN. WATCH YOUR LAMPS. NOW, WHICH WAY? WELL, SEE IF OLD FLASH KNOWS THE WAY. GO ON, FLASH. GO TO THE FACE. GO ON, LAD. IS THAT BETTER? I CAN WALK 20 MILE ON IT NOW. AYE. I WOULDN'T TRY IT IF I WERE YOU. IS THAT YOU, ALF?! AYE. MY GOD, IT'S BAD UP THERE. DID YOU HEAR ANYTHING FROM BEYOND THE FALL? NOT A SOUND. I RECKON IT'LL TAKE TWO OR THREE DAYS BEFORE THE GAS CLEARS ENOUGH TO LET THEM THROUGH. THEY PROBABLY THINK WE'RE DEAD, ANYWAY. WON'T BE LONG BEFORE THEY'RE RIGHT. HEY, JAKE, YOU'RE A REAL TONIC. JUST A MINUTE--STOP. I'M JUST GOING TO TEST FOR FIREDAMP. YES, THERE'S A SHOW HERE. GREAT HEAVENS. IT'S VERY HEAVY. IS IT THAT BAD, SIR? WHY, IT'S UP TO THE LIMIT. WE DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME. Carter: YES, MILORD, STRAIGHT AWAY. Lord Harrogate: TELL HER SHE'D BE MOST WELCOME. UH, MRS. SANDMAN, LORD HARROGATE WAS WONDERING WHETHER YOU'D LIKE TO GO AND SIT IN THE CAR. OH... WOULD YOU THANK HIS LORDSHIP, BUT SAY I PREFER TO WAIT HERE. RIGHT YOU ARE. GIVE THAT TO MRS. SANDMAN. MY MUM WONDERED IF YOU WANT A BLANKET. WELL, THANK YOU, DEAR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANKS, LUKE. YOU ALL RIGHT, GEORGE? I'M ALL RIGHT, LAD. HOW IS HE? HE'S POORLY. HE'S REAL POORLY. WHAT IS IT, FLASH? WHAT IS IT? IT'S BLOCKED. HE BROUGHT US TO A DEAD END. WHAT'S THAT? IT'S THEM! HE'S DONE IT! GOOD OLD FLASH! THEY FOUND THEM! DOCTOR! DOCTOR, THEY NEED YOU DOWN BELOW! man: LADS, FOLLOW ME! STEADY. MIND HIS LEGS. YOU'RE ALL RIGHT, LAD. Mr. Sandman: RIGHT, GINGER. doctor: COME ON, LAD. man: THANK YOU, SIR. GOOD WORK. RAMSDEN, YOU ALL RIGHT? AYE, SIR. LET'S SEE THE OTHER LADS, SIR. KEEP GOING OUT. Carter: THERE'S THREE LADS COMING UP NOW! ALF RAMSDEN! GEORGE SNAPE! man: GEORGE SNAPE? SNAPE'S IN THERE. PETER HOLROYD! RIGHT, HARRY! LOOK OUT, ONE SPARK MIGHT SEND THE WHOLE PLACE UP. QUICK AS YOU CAN, DOCTOR. RIGHT. IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU, GEORGE. AH, KEN. HOW'S THINGS DOWN THERE? HOW IS IT, GEORGE? OH, LIKE A POWDER KEG. I ONLY HOPE WE CAN GET THEM ALL OUT BEFORE IT GOES UP. COME ON, GINGER! UP YOU GO. YOU DONE WELL, LAD. RIGHT, THERE'S NO ONE ELSE. WELL, THEN FOR GOD'S SAKE, SIR, LET'S GET OUT WHILE WE CAN. Carter: ROY LAYCOCK! AMOS BURLEY! JAKE ARBUTHNOT! GINGER TRUMAN! LUKE ARMSTRONG! Carter: ANYBODY ELSE BELOW, LUKE? NO, NOBODY. ONLY BILL AND THE MANAGER, AND THEY'RE ON THEIR WAY UP. MR. SANDMAN! RICHARD! RICHARD. FATHER, I'M SORRY. WELL DONE, SANDMAN, MY BOY. WELL DONE, INDEED. EXCELLENT! WELL DONE-- EVERY SINGLE MAN OF YOU. THANK YOU! THANK YOU, EVERYBODY! WHERE'S-- WHERE'S FLASH? I UNHITCHED HIM FROM HIS SLEDGE. I THOUGHT HE WOULD-- I RECKON HE THOUGHT HIS SHIFT WERE OVER, SO HE HEADED BACK FOR THE STABLES. I'LL GO DOWN AND FETCH HIM. NO, LUKE! NO! HE'LL HAVE GONE THROUGH THE VENTILATION DOORS. YOU'LL NEVER FIND HIM. DON'T DO IT, LUKE. FLASH SAVED OUR LIVES! NO! I'M NOT GOING TO LEAVE HIM DOWN THERE. NO, LUKE, DON'T GO! DON'T GO, LUKE! THERE, LAD. GOOD NIGHT. GOOD NIGHT, MILORD. WELL, SANDMAN, MY GOODNESS-- A TRULY MIRACULOUS ESCAPE. THANK GOD ALL IS WELL, HMM? THAT'S RIGHT, MILORD. TELL ME, SANDMAN, WHY ARE THE CHILDREN CRYING? ONE OF THE PONIES GOT LEFT BEHIND, MILORD. A PONY BUT SURELY--SURELY THEY KNOW ALL THE MEN HAVE BEEN SAVED. YES, MILORD, THAT MAY MAKE SENSE TO...OUTSIDERS. BUT THOSE PONIES MEAN A LOT TO THEM. AH, YES, BUT-- GOOD NIGHT, MILORD. MY--MY FEW WORDS ARE SIMPLY THIS-- WELCOME, EVERYBODY, TO THE MINERS'-- MINERS' PICNIC. AH, MRS. RAMSBOTTOM, AS YOU SEE, HAS PREPARED THIS EXCELLENT TEA FOR YOU. THANK YOU. NOW, AFTER YOU HAVE ENJOYED YOUR TEA, WE HAVE A LITTLE CEREMONY TO PERFORM, BUT NO MORE OF THAT NOW. TO TEA, EVERYBODY. ENJOY YOUR TEA. AYE, BUT THE BEST OF THEM ALL WERE FLASH. SEEMS IT'S ALWAYS THE BEST THAT GO. YOUR FATHER WAS THE BEST FRIEND I EVER HAD. I RECKON I'LL MISS HIM TO MY DYING DAY. I WISH IT COULD HAVE BEEN FLASH OUT HERE IN THE SUNSHINE. NO. NO. WHEN HE WAS ABOVE GROUND... FLASH KNEW THAT HE WAS BLIND. ARE YOU GONNA STAND THERE ALL DAY LOOKING AT HORSES, OR ARE YOU GONNA COME AND HAVE SOME TEA? LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IN HONOR OF FLASH, I HAVE VERY GREAT PLEASURE IN DONATING THIS FIELD IN WHICH ALL HIS FRIENDS-- THE OTHER PIT PONIES-- WILL LIVE OUT THE REST OF THEIR LIVES IN COMFORT AND FREEDOM. SO... I NOW CALL UPON MISS ALICE SANDMAN. ARE YOU READY? VERY WELL, THEN-- CUT THAT RIBBON. * COME ON!
