[Dramatic music playing] [Narrator] The story you are about to see is true. It is based on actual fact. As toid by one who iii/ed it. Well, Mr. Johnson, it appears if we can guarantee delivery by mid-April, we can consummate the deal. Well, actually, Mr. Latham, we could stretch our side as far as the 20th but certainly not beyond that. We have delivery schedules we must meet also. Yes, yes, of course. Well, I'll check for that factory, I think we should be able to have confirmation for you by, shall we say, noon tomorrow. That'll be fine, thank you. Now, how about some tea? Perhaps a drink? I understand you Americans enjoy a bit of a drink in the afternoon. Well, texans damn sure do. I'll take a whiskey with ice, if you have it, lad. Yes, yes, Johnny, would you, please? I'll have scotch and water. - Certainly. - Thank you. That's an unusual map. Yes, I suppose it is, now. I keep it here as sort of a souvenir. Looks like a military map. World war 11, isn't it? Yes, yes. Were you in the war? Hell, yes. I spent four years in the marines. Hopping those damn cruddy islands over in the pacific. How about yourself? Well, yes, but nothing quite that exciting I'm afraid. I was staff officer, a major with shaef. Supreme headquarters allied European forces. But, I'm afraid, I never got out of London. Thank you, Johnny. I'm afraid the major is being a little bit modest. Even if he never did leave London, the fact of the matter is major latham directed one of the most unusual spy cases of the world. If it hadn't been for him... We might all be speaking German here today. [Johnson] Espionage, really? And it won the war for us? Well, I don't think I'd go quite that far. [Johnny] I would. [Johnson] Well, tell me about it, if you don't mind. I'd love to hear it. [Johnny] This is your story, Mr. Latham. You tell it to him. Well, Johnny, 1... Don't want to bore Mr. Johnson with old war stories. I'm sure, with four years in the pacific, my exploits are going to seem a bit tame. Not at all, I'd really like to hear it, if you don't mind. I don't mind. As a matter of fact, I rather enjoy reliving it. Now, let's see, where should I begin? Well, there was a German by the name of hans pabst Von ohain. He developed the axial—flow turbojet in 1939, and shortly thereafter, he demonstrated it in Paris. A few years later, the Nazis had all but taken over the whole of Europe. And england itself was under constant bombardment. We were aware of Germany's superior strength at this point of the war, but we, we were in hopes that we, along with our allies, could eventually turn the tide in our favor. The American commander, general Olson, and myself had devised a rather bizarre scheme. Which nevertheless, we felt, had great merit. That he'd arranged a joint meeting in temporary allied headquarters with the French and the Russians. Intelligence reports that Karl stahl, the man basically responsible for building this German jet fighter, died of a heart attack. That's excellent, general Olson. That's quite a break for us. Yes, it is. But there are many scientists there that could take his place. Now what we're particularly concerned with right now is his assistant, Martha Grossman. I think major latham can fill you in on that. Major. Thank you, general Olson, I'll try. You see, gentlemen, for some years Martha Grossman has been sympathetic to the allied cause. And she's been sending information back pertaining to their experiments, to our rocket experts here in London. And judging from that information, we're quite far behind in the development of this aircraft and its fuel. We're greatly concerned that should they be first in the air with this type of aircraft, they could defeat us soundly in the skies. So, what happened to this Ms. Grossman? [Latham] That is our problem. Martha Grossman is a Jew. She was safe as long as stahl was alive and protecting her, but immediately after his death she was removed from the project and placed into a concentration camp. I'm sure the Germans questioned her loyalty or otherwise she would've been allowed to continue, Jew or not. [Olson] Thank you, major. Right now, we're doing everything we can with sabotage, bombing raids and so forth to try to stop the Germans from their experiments and manufacture of this jet aircraft. But we feel that if we could possibly contact Martha Grossman, there's a very good chance that she would have information that could quickly solve a lot of our problems, and really get us back in the race. But where is this Martha Grossman now? Our underground sources have traced Martha Grossman's whereabouts to... A special Nazi women's prison camp near the village of steingarten. Well, steingarten is here, and the prison camp about three miles south. That's about here. Steingarten is used as a rest or recuperation area for frontline German officers. The women, mostly Jewish, are in the camp for the sole purpose of being prostitutes. Now, our plan is simply this, we want to place two of our women inside that camp. And their assignment will be to locate Martha Grossman, to obtain and memorize as much of the information pertaining to her experiments and jet engines as they can. [Foreign officer] That sounds a little far fetched. Well, perhaps. But for our sake, I certainly hope that it isn't. Those women would be worse than whores. Who could you possibly find to undertake an assignment such as this one? [Latham] Genera? Oison had of course aireao'y made his seiectfon. The American women's anny corps iiies provided as with 2? Names that were exceiieht possihiiities. These two ofi'icers were ohe fihai choice. Gentlemen, may I introduce wac lieutenants Linda harman and grace Freeman. Both of these officers, with full previous knowledge of the assignment, have volunteered to aid us. Won't you sit down, please? [Olson] It's my opinion that lieutenants harman and Freeman are excellent choices for this assignment. Both of them are experts in the field of guerrilla warfare, hand-to-hand combat and karate. In addition, they both speak French and German. I feel confident that these women can handle the mission. But even if they do find Martha Grossman, suppose she's too ill to be moved, or killed in the escape, then all of this is for nothing. The Germans are not going to sit by while these two ladies take notes. We have, of course, considered that. These two women have recently undergone extensive training and memorization with the army intelligence corps at fort holabird in Baltimore. They have almost total recall of everything they have heard or read. If I may demonstrate? What is your age, general? - —Forty seven. - Thank you. Memorize from page 47 until I stop you. [Stahl] I know what you all must be thinking. But this jet project has top priority. We must try anything. I repeat, anything... That has the slightest chance of giving us the information we so desperately need. Ladies, if you will close the manual and repeat in unison from page 47. "A general area survey is a continuing study by investigators of military installations or adjacent areas to determine whether or not the security measures in force are adequate. On military reservations, the survey is conducted to determine the adequacy of the security of specific facilities. The survey of communities normally includes the study of civilian population, local law enforcement agencies, enforcement procedures, and specific conditions conducive to crime within the area. This survey maybe over..." Thank you very much, lieutenants, that's very good. Truly remarkable. Then I presume we have your approval? All right, major, if you'll continue. Well, it seems we're in agreement. Ladies, you'll be parachuted in and once there, you'll be met by a captain Robert calais, of the French underground, and his men. He will furnish the necessary clothing, identification and other information at that point which will be necessary to complete your assignment. He will then transport you to steingarten, to the rot finster hofbr'au. It is at this cafe that you will be arrested by the gestapo. It will also of course, as has been so well pointed out, be necessary for you to cooperate with Jerry in any manner they order. For as we have told you, those who don't end up in the gas chamber. When do we leave? Tonight, 2100 hours. [Suspenseful music playing] [Latham] The parachute drop went off without incident. Both girls fancied safeiy in a fieid iocated 14 miies due east of the city of steingarten. Ahoat three and a haif miies from the love camp itseif. Jerry was well aware of resistance activity, and had patrols out, constantly searching the area. Sit down, please. Ladies, I'm Robert calais. Here are your credentials. You are Bertha Liechtenstein, and you are Cara strassberg. Now, here's a history of yourselves. I understand you can memorize completely? Yes, we can. It tells who your mother, your father were, where you were born and so forth. Now, as you know, you will have exactly five days once you're in the camp to secure and memorize all the information that is necessary. Martha Grossman is still in the camp. Since all the women are housed in one barrack, you should have no trouble contacting her. It is necessary that you make her believe... That you are allies, and not German spies. Or she will tell you nothing. That's going to take some convincing. Do you have something you could give us, something to prove who we are? You will be thoroughly searched by a doctor, and bathed before being placed in the camp. It is impossible to smuggle anything in that would help you to win her confidence. So, we must rely on your memory. Memory of the past experiences that she was involved in. Here, therefore, is a list of our people that she has communicated with. Memorize it. Now, lets get started. Suppose you change. Where can we change? Right here. Here? Perhaps your mission has not been clearly explained to you. For the next five days you're going to be whores for the third reich. And you will have to be convincing in that task. I think you will find, from this moment forth, there is no room for modesty in your personalities. And besides, I have no time for it. Now, get changed. Now, on the morning of the fifth day, at 0300 hours, my guerrilla forces will attack the camp. The Nazis only have a minimum security. In that they feel that 50 women prisoners will be unable to create any major problem. The instant you hear gunfire, we will cut the fence. You will, of course, bring Martha Grossman with you. But no one else. I know it's cruel to leave the other women there. But there's really nothing else we can do. Too many people moving across that yard would be seen. A British airplane will have landed two miles east of this present location. And three of you will be flown back to allied headquarters. Now, here is the guard building. Over here to the left are the women's barracks. Over here, a large storage shack. We will be attacking from this area. We will draw all the guards out of the shack and pull them around to this point. Now, there's only one tower, over here... In this corner. And that tower will also be firing back at us. At this point, the yard will be virtually unguarded. And you should easily be able to make your way out and around to the other side of the storage area. Prior to the attack, we will have already have our men positioned in this area on the other side of the fence. Are you sure you know where it is? Yes, we have it. Now, here is a photograph of Martha Grossman. It was taken a few years ago. It's difficult of course, to say how much she has changed now but I hope this will help you recognize her. Do you... have any questions? No, it's very clear. All right then. As soon as you're ready, we leave for steingarten. You are both very brave. It will not be pleasant. [Latham] At 0515 hours, are foiiowirig morhihg, the girls were arrested by the gestapo in steingarten. Captain caiais had aiiowed Jerry to receive faise information. That the road fence to hofhrau was being used to harbor Jews. Welcome, ladies, to love camp number seven. At the moment perhaps some of you feel you're unfortunate. But let me assure you... That your being sent to love camp 7... Was by far the most pleasant of all alternatives. I cannot guarantee you that you will love love camp 7. But I can guarantee... That you will love in love camp 7. You have been brought here for one purpose and one purpose only, that is to please the frontline officers of our armies. I and my men will see to it that you please them entirely. To please will be your only function. Lovely. I'm sure when you're dressed, or undressed, definitely in any event should be very charming. I'm afraid, Klaus muller, that this rather... Distorted young lady will be of very little use to us. Remove her, please. Remove her, she's pregnant. Leave me! Please, no! Shut up, you Jewish pig! Now, ladies, I'm sure you're exhausted and grimy after your dusty trip and you want to clean up, freshen yourself, make yourselves lovely. So, I will see to it that sergeant Klaus muller, and corporal reiss here, arrange for you to have every possible toilet accessory for your pleasure, cleanliness and hygiene. We want to make you most comfortable. Sergeant Klaus miiller, corporal reiss, you'll take care of the ladies, I'm sure. [Soldiers laughing] Get up! Get up! Get up! Get up! Get up! Well, ladies, I trust you find yourself refreshed after your little shower. Each one of you girls has been chosen to work in love camp 7. To serve the third reich with your bodies and your will. If any one of you finds that choice distasteful... Then let us know now so that we can give you your alternatives. But I assure you, the alternatives you will find increasingly distasteful. For instance, Auschwitz, belsen, dacha... Actually, I think you'll find this camp is not nearly as bad as you would imagine. [Chuckling] In fact, it's almost a holiday. You'll be fed regularly, you'll have warm, comfortable clothing, you'll be expected to keep yourself clean. Each of you will be issued a ration of cosmetics, and you will be expected to use those cosmetics in order to keep yourself attractive for the officers of the reich. Now, then, before you go to your barracks there are just a few formalities. For instance, we have to have a medical inspection to see that everybody's in good health. However, we have seen to it that you never suffer an indignity in camp 7. We are not going to subject you to an examination by one of the guards, or even a male doctor. We have gone to the great trouble to secure a female doctor. So that none of you Jewish ladies will have any of your high sensitivities offended. Send in the doctor for me, please. [Knock at door] Come in, doctor. =heil, Hitler. =heil, Hitler. [Hoestat] They're all yours, doctor. [Doctor] Remove your clothing. [Hoestat] Quickly, do as the doctor has ordered. I want you ladies to, at all times, be extremely cooperative with Dr. Chernov. Only recently, she received a commendation, from the fuhrer's medical committee in Berlin, for her excellent record and untiring devotion to the reich. I'm certain that if you cooperate with her she'll always be considerate of you ladies and your problems. It should be comforting for you to know that you always have a friend here, at love camp 7. You're first. Get off me, you pig! Get off! [Doctor] All right, you. [Linda wincing] I understand, Ms. Strassberg, that your father was a banker in Wiesbaden, is that correct? I should imagine, what, with the war and everything, the banking business isn't what it used to be. Certainly the interest rates are down, yeah? [Chuckles] What seems to be the matter, Ms. Strassberg? You don't like your first day in love camp 7? I promise you, it's going to be a lot worse than this. This is only a beginning. For instance... [Screaming] [Groaning] And you, Ms. Liechtenstein, I understand, your father is in the haberdashery business in dusseldorf, is that correct? [Groaning in pain] [Latham] We had, as yet, received no word from the French underground. And we waited patientiy at aiiied headquarters for communication from captain calais. Sirs, we're receiving a message from blue fox one. Switch on the speaker. [Calais] The snow is on the ground. There were two birds sighted in the sky, eadier this evening. It appeared as though they were flying in a northeasterly direction. I am very tired and wiii sieep for five days. I will be contacting you on blue code channel as listed in publication, 14 a. Your directive dated January 2nd. This is blue fox one, out. They bloody-well made it. They'll be in the camp by now. Ladies, we've brought you four new roommates. I'm sure you'll make them welcome to love camp 7, and explain all the rules and regulations to them. What is your name? I'm Helga. How long have you been here? We came in together, about six months... I don't know any more. I used to keep track, but, I don't know for sure. It was September 14th, my husband and I were hiding in a basement. At dusk we went out to look for food, as we always did. They saw him first, he screamed for me to run, but I couldn't. He was wounded. We were brought to prison camp in a large boxcar. So as the men and women were separated, a few of the women, not many, were taken here. Do you know where your husband is now? Do you? No. No, we don't. What will happen to us now? They won't let you be with the officers until they know how cooperative you are. The first thing that will happen is you will have to service all the guards in the camp. Then when they're sure you will be good prostitutes, you will be taken to stalag ii. What is that? —it's a room. It is like this one, only it has a series of partitions and beds. We usually go there about an hour or two after dinner. Then they transport the officers from steingarten, and we just continue making love to them... Until they've all been taken care of. Sometimes, when the officers leave, they bring in a bus load of enlisted men. How were you captured? We were looking for food also. [Women laughing] They seem happy. All things are not so bad here if they like you. We are fed well, they don't like skinny whores. The work camp we were in, conditions were horrible. In the four days we were there, eight people died of starvation and disease. Some of the women even seem to like this life. We are better off than most, I guess. Once an officer asked me to do something I didn't like. He complained to the commandant. Now, if I see that officer again, I'll do it. I'll do it and anything else they wish. And you'll do the same if you wish to survive. Do you know Martha Grossman? Yes, but she's not here now. I saw her last night. She was in a cubicle across from mine. Sometimes they leave us in stalag ii to service some of the officers that come in on their own vehicles. We better get some rest now. I suggest you do the same. Tonight you'll be with the guards. This may be your most difficult night here. Ladies, you must forgive me for interrupting your brief rest period. However, some of you are not quite as cooperative as others. For instance, take Ms. Kauffman here. Ms. Kauffman felt, said it was an indignity for her to be examined in order to please the third reich, and that she was above this. Now, some of you are new prisoners, and you're not perhaps familiar with our seat of honor. I'm sure Ms. Kauffman isn't familiar. However, we are going to make her familiar with it. We have done everything in this camp we can to make you comfortable and to make you happy. And we expect your cooperation. You have two choices, cooperate or move to another camp. Show Ms. Kauffman to the seat of honor. Perhaps some of you new ladies will get some idea of what we expect from you if you pay close attention. [Screaming continues] God, no! God, no! Now, ladies, I suggest that while Ms. Kauffman is on the seat of honor, no one attempt to help her in any manner. Unless, of course, you choose to take her place. And that we can arrange very, very easily. I warn you, no one is to help her. Ladies, for your own good, I hope you will be sensible. [Wincing and grunting] You helped her! You helped her! I told you! I told you, do not help her! But you helped her! Now everyone... all of you suffer for one person! I told them in the high command you people are good for nothing! Nothing but extermination! Now, get your robes off and form a circle! Get your buckets in your hands, you pigs! Klaus mijiler, get them in a circle! Get your buckets up! Heil Hitler, everyone. Up in the air. Now, the first one to let the bucket down will feel my whip! Keep your hands up! Keep them up! Are your arms getting tired? Watch that one, sergeant Klaus muller. Put your hands up! Heil Hitler! Go ahead, put the bucket down. Give me a chance to use my whip! Come now, ladies, it isn't that difficult. You imagine those buckets are growing heavy on your arms. Pretend they're just flowers you're picking in the field, and maybe you'll be able to hold your arms up for few more minutes. [Suspenseful music playing] [Man] Now, from this vantage point, we have full view of anyone leaving or entering the main barracks. They have already been given dinner, but as yet we've not had visual contact with Martha Grossman. Our last contact was 23 hours ago when she was taken to the officers section. She's either still there or something went wrong. Could be in the detention room. From where we are located, the exit and entrance from the officers barracks and into the detention room are concealed by the warehouse. I will contact you again on any further developments. This is radio, out. Good evening, ladies. Good evening. How is my favorite pupil this evening? Please, help me. I'll do anything you want. I'm sure you'll do anything we want, but you see, dear, I told the other ladies you're going to be here all evening to set an example. And you've only been there five hours. You have at least 11 hours to go. I would love to help you but I just can't. [Screaming] Klaus miiller, revive my pupil so she can continue her studies. Yeah, okay. [Chuckling] And then get these women ready and out of here. And now, I want the girls who came in new this morning... Lined up over here. The rest of you will line up along here. You're going to work. Now, what are you waiting for? Out! Move, move! Move! And now, you two, you have been selected to go to the commandant's office where you will entertain the guards of this compound. And if you are successful, you will be allowed to join the others in the officers' section tomorrow night. Take them out. And now, you two, we have selected you for our pleasures. Sergeant gotthardt. Comrade, which one do you want? I... have no preference. All right. Then I will make my selection first. [Grace wincing] [Klaus grunting] Yes, I think I will take this one. I'm sorry. But as guards here, there are certain things that we have to do. I understand. God, you're hurting me. Wait, you're hurting me. Don't misunderstand me, I enjoy sex like any man... [Linda struggling and wincing] But not the torture or the beatings. Perhaps in another place, another time, things could've been different between the two of us. But here, here I must follow my orders. There are people being killed and people who kill. And they too... must follow their orders, regardless of what they personally wish. You don't have to apologize. I understand. Oh? Do you? There are people in the back of this barracks, they're probably watching us right now. [Linda's struggling continues] [Guard grunting] Please, don't. [Grunting continues] Sir, sergeant gotthardt is here. Send him in. Sergeant gotthardt reporting, sir. Sit down, gotthardt. I see you've requested a transfer again, gotthardt. Yes, sir. I thought I made it very clear to you that I consider a request for transfer a personal offense. Gotthardt, you are here because of your excellent record. Now, if you continue to request these transfers, people are going to think you're not happy in love camp 7. And we want you happy. Sir, as I explained in my letter, my only reason for a request is a personal need to get back to fighting the war. I feel like I can be of more value to the fatherland in that capacity—... I take it then you disagree with the opinions of the officers whose orders have placed you here, gotthardt? Sir, I question no one's opinion or judgment. But may I remind you, as an uncommissioned officer, I have a right to—... The only rights you have are the rights to obey exactly what I tell you. Now, gotthardt, the other men enjoy their work, why can't you? With due respect to the commandant, I feel that most of what happens here is unnecessary and inhumane. You feel it's inhumane, gotthardt? Now, let's assume for one ridiculous moment... That I might be interested in what you think, I'd like to know, what do you think is inhumane. I feel that Dr. Chernov's experiments on the women is inhumane. Dr. Chernov's experiments come from direct orders from Dr. Sach in Berlin, the head of all experimentation. And every experiment is recorded, filed and sent to Berlin. You question that authority? Twenty 7 women have died in the past three months due to Dr. Chernov's experiments and sterilization. Sterilization is necessary for the purification of the race, you know that, gotthardt. She has been using a heavy paste which she injects fully into the womb. This causes great pain for a period of a week, and then the eventual death of the patient. It's necessary to find a working method, gotthardt. The exact same method has been used on those 27 women with the exact same result, pain and death. Isn't it obvious by now, the method does not work? Is there anything else that troubles you, gotthardt? Sir, my sole reason for this request... Is to return to the war. And my sole reason for denying the request is to maintain discipline in the camp, gotthardt. Your request is denied. You're dismissed. Heil Hitler! Oh, uh, gotthardt, I think I'm tired of pampering you. For the next three months, in your off hours, you will serve as Dr. Chernov's assistant in the experiments. Perhaps by actually working firsthand, you'll be able to get a greater understanding of the situation. I fully understand now, colonel. Do you, gotthardt? There's an overbearing sickness in this camp. What happens here is wrong! These people are human beings and the cruelties that takes place in this camp - is totally unnecessary! - Gotthardt. These people aren't human beings. They exist solely to serve the third reich and when the third reich is done with them, they become garbage and we discard them, gotthardt. You exist solely to serve the third reich. Be very careful, gotthardt, that you don't become garbage. Or you could be discarded. Now, you're dismissed, get out. =heil Hitler! =heil Hitler. Sir, we just decoded a message from blue fox one. Thank you, sergeant. General Olson. Yes? We've just received a message from blue fox one. Our girls are in the barracks and everything seems to be going as planned. Exceiient. Yes, sir. There is one problem. We seem to have lost track of Martha Grossman. She was taken last night to stalag ii, the officers' barracks, and has not yet been returned to her quarters. Well, my child, I assume you're prepared to be more cooperative today? Yes, I'll do anything. Yes. Please... All right, take her down. We'll see how well she learned her lesson. Yeah, heil commandant. [Sobbing] Very well, you say you're prepared to do anything. Let's start with, say, my boots. Crawl over here and lick my boots. Make sure you get them very clean. [Suspenseful music playing] Now, the other boot. You do extremely nice work, pig. How are you? Fine. Just tired. How many did you have? Eight. You were lucky to get sergeant gotthardt and his men. He's the only decent one here. He tries to help whenever he can. You see, officers, most of them are so drunk, they're no problem, sometimes they are sadistic, try to hit the girls, if you double up and hold your head they soon grow tired. Have you heard anything about Martha Grossman? Oh, yes. The girl with the officer next to me last night... Said she overheard Martha complaining of being ill. The guards got angry, and she thinks Martha was taken to the detention room. What does that mean? Well, that is where girls who misbehave are usually taken for punishment and torture. They keep them there, usually a day or so, until they've broken their spirit. Then they're either sent back here, or to the gas chambers. You look exhausted, you better get some rest. We've got to figure something out. We don't have too much time. I think I have a plan. [Latham] Two days had passed since the girls had been captured, and taken in to the camp. Although calais and his men had the camp under constant surveillance, they were only able to give us information as to where the girls were located. We can only surmise as to what actually went on inside those barbed fences and gray walls. When we received word that they had been taken to the officers section, we knew at least that they had won the confidence of the camp guards. No prisoner was ever put into this section until it was determined that she would be cooperative. The camp was visited by hundreds of oficers each week. Colonel Karl muller, once head of Hitler's Nazi youth movement, he was now on leave at steingarten, from Russia. Where his campaigns had been successful in driving the gemian armies deep into the Soviet union. Colonel Max kemp, a member of the dreaded Nazi 55. For the past year, he had been in charge of extermination at buchenwald and Auschwitz. His visits to love camp 7 were frequent. And it seemed curious that a man who could order the execution of, literally, millions of human beings, could have such a desire to, at the same time, make love to those he might later be disposing of. After the war colonel kemp avoided capture, and even to this date has not been brought to justice. [Ominous music playing] [Moaning and grunting] General Marcus kirschman, second in command of the Nazi ss, under Heinrich himmler. Like colonel kemp, he was also a frequent visitor to the various love camps in the area. Our constant surveillance of this camp proved an unusual fact. There were more high ranking officers in one place at one time due to these camps than were ever assembled for any other reason. As a result of this information, the love camps became a prime target for resistance forces toward the end of the war. There were 12 love camps in all. And when they were finally liberated, ?6 high ranking odicers were captured. Which greatly weakened the Nazi high command at a time when the allies needed it most. [Ominous music continues] You Nazi pig! You will regret this! Swine! Up, woman! Well, private, shall we make our young troublemaker comfortable? Seems comfortable, Ms. Strassberg? And now, private, if you don't mind, we would like to be alone. Of course, sergeant Klaus muller. And now, you Jewish pig, you will see, you will think once more... About turning down the favors of an officer of the third reich! I have something for you. I think you will find it very enjoyable. [Dramatic music playing] [Screaming] Stop! Stop! Enjoying that? No, please! Are you impressed? Are you thinking about this indiscipline? Please, stop! No! [Sobbing] Stop! Stop! Please, no! God! [Screaming] No! Stop! [Linda sobbing] [Woman] God, hold on. I am going to help you. Okay? I am underneath you now. If you put your feet on my back, you can release the pressure. Are you Martha Grossman? Yeah, how did you know? We've been looking for you. What do you mean, you have been looking for me? I'm a wac in United States army. I've been sent here by direct orders of the allied high command in London. My mission is to contact you and to help you escape. [Screams] God, please! You have to listen to me! I'm telling you the truth. I can prove it to you. I do not want to hear it. I have information that could've only been given to me by the allied forces. If you wish I can give you the name of every officer you're written... Since 1938, until your capture on August 14th. Your contact here in Germany, his name is John Marco. He's about 5'8", he has a red beard. The first man you contacted in Washington was general Seymour Arlington. Please, help me. Please, help me. I have been here too long. I am suspicious of everyone. I still do not know whether to believe you. You must trust me. How would a German know this? General Arlington is the commander of jet aircraft construction at bishop air force base, Virginia. He subsequently turned your file over to brigadier general Thomas hoff at the Pentagon. All right. I believe you. [Martha] What do we do now? I want you tell me everything you know about your jet experiments. We received no word from you eight months prior to your capture. We feel that you can give us additional important information. Yeah, a great deal happened. We did develop a fuel that reacted... Exactly as we had hoped. All right. I can memorize what you tell me. The escape plan has already been set up. I have a partner with me. The three of us will get out. Now, tell me everything you know. [Triumphant music playing] [Narrator] On the morning of the third day, the camp was visited by general erich Von hamer. He had been with rommel in Africa for over a year. He was now to replace general Carl brenner as the area commander in steingarten. He was one of rommel's most decorated officers, and his new assignment was designed to give him a rest period from frontline activities. Shouldn't we call the commandant and tell him the general is at the compound? No, private, I don't think that will be necessary. [Ominous music playing] [Knock at door] Sir, general Von hamer is here. That'll be all, private. Heil Hitler! It's a pleasure to see you, sir. Is it? May I offer you a drink, sir? I don't drink. Well, you've turned this place into quite a nice office. You have all the comforts of home here, I see. Well, we try to make all the officers here as comfortable as possible. Perhaps you'd like a cigar, sir? - These came from... - Filthy habit. Perhaps, sir, you would be interested in the women. I can arrange anything you might—... I'm not here for pleasure. My orders. I'm replacing general brenner as your area commander. The general staff in Berlin has decided to rotate the commanding officers here every 7 months. Since general brenner has been in steingarten for over a year, it is felt that he should be sent to a combat position, to the Russian front, I understand. And gives the rest of us, who have been fighting this war, a much needed rest. Tell me, hoestat, how long have you been on duty here? Sir, I was put in charge of this camp by reichsfuhrer himmler himself. And it was my understanding that the reichsfuhrer wanted me to be the permanent camp commander. How long have you been here? Sixteen months, sir. However, at that time, reichsfuhrer himmler told me that... It was himmler himself who suggested this rotation. However, hoestat, I don't think we have a problem here. I'm aware of your civilian occupation, and your selection by Heinrich himmler. Therefore, as long as things operate smoothly here I see no reason why you can't stay on for a period of time. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Look, I have always tried to keep everything at the camp as perfect as possible. I have many letters of commendation from officers who have been here. And each one clearly states... All of them have been treated like pigs! You sit here in absolute splendor while my officers see the women in one dirty room with cheap wooden dividers. But, you see, sir, we have a problem with space here. We have one building for the women, we have one building for the storage, -we have-— —so, from now on, you'll entertain the officers here! You clean out that sty of yours and put up some permanent walls, carpet and furnish the rooms. Yes, sir. Of course, sir. I'll be bringing my staff officers here on Friday. You will personally entertain them here. They will have dinner, whiskey and as much of the women as they wish. And I want them to wear some lingerie. They'll look better. Agreed? Certainly, sir. Of course. I assume you've been keeping the women in a good healthy condition? In excellent condition, sir. Perhaps you'd like to inspect some. I can have some assembled in the courtyard in just a—... That won't be necessary, colonel. I trust your excellent professional judgment. Any man who's had as much civilian experience in handling this kind of a woman should not be questioned. However, there might something you could do for me personally. Anything, herr general. Anything at all. One of the wac lieutenants was taken to the detention room. If you wish, we can alter our plans and attack now, to get the women free. No, it is impossible to change the schedule. We'll have to leave the plan as is. Besides, they're very smart girls. And they wouldn't have done anything wrong to have created a situation where they would be taken to the detention room. Unless they've done it on purpose. Have you seen Martha Grossman? Lilo, sir. That worries me. Perhaps she may also be in the detention room. We must give our women an opportunity to secure the information that they need. I'll be waiting here. Keep alert. Out. Ladies, this evening, you're going to have the honor of entertaining one of the highest ranking officers in the third reich. I will expect that he will be extremely happy at the end of the evening. Now, this gentleman does not care to involve himself with non-aryans. He just wants to watch you perform. I expect you to make love to each other while the gentleman watches. Is that very clear? I don't think I have to give you a description of exactly what I want. But I want this officer to leave here completely satisfied, that each one of you gave your all for the performance. If there's any complaint, I promise you, the punishment will fit the crime. You'll excuse me, if I don't stay. All right, ladies, get started. [Tense music playing] [Women moaning] [Moaning continues] [Music intensifies] Sir, this is latham. Right, latham. Sir, I've just had a communication from blue fox one. Captain calais reports Martha Grossman and lieutenant Freeman were taken from the detention room at 0200 hours yesterday. All the prisoners remained inside their barracks throughout the day. The attack is still set for 0300 hours this morning. Very good, latham. Schedule a meeting for all other commanders in my office for 0200 hours this morning. We 7! Monitor the attack from there. Yes, sir. That'll be all, sergeant. [Narrator] At 1900 hours on the evening of the fifth day captain calais started to move his men into position around the camp. A diversionary attack was to be launched at the front gate... Allowing calais to free the women from the southeast corner of the camp, behind the storage shed. Congratulations, ladies. Your company has been requested at the commandant's office. However, it is a little early for that party. And so, we will wait here for a while. Put these on. And while we are waiting, why don't you come over here with... Why don't you leave her alone? And why don't you shut up? No! No! No! Just leave her alone! If you do that again, I will kill you! These women are nothing! We can do anything as Germans, to them that we want! Anything! And if you, you don't like to watch, He's a pig. We all are, I guess. It's just that, sometimes, we can't help it. You've always been kind to us. Thank you. I personally don't agree with any of this. I don't think it's necessary. Do you mean the war or this concentration camp? This camp. Perhaps even the war. I don't know. I do know that people should not be treated like animals. If you believe that, would you help us to escape? I couldn't do that. Why not? You said you didn't like it. Why can't you do something about it? I'm a soldier, I have to follow my orders. Even if they do make me sick to my stomach. They'd never know that you were involved. We'd see to that. But if it's wrong, if you think it's wrong what's happening here, then you have a personal obligation to do something about it. I am a soldier: I have no choice, I must follow my orders. Perhaps if I were an officer... Perhaps then, things might be different. But for now, I'm only a soldier. I realize you can't understand that. But no matter what, a soldier must follow his orders. I understand. The commandant is ready. [Linda whimpering] [German music playing on radio] [Narrator] The party in the commandant's office had, of course, not been anticipated. The existing plan had called for the women to make their escape from the officers section, located in the center of the compound. Since the women's escape route would now be over twice the distance than was originally planned, calais contacted allied headquarters and requested the attack be delayed for 24 hours. However, since it was determined that both, lieutenant harman and Freeman, along with Martha Grossman were now located in one building, general Olson decided that the attack should commence as planned. He felt that it could've been several more days until a situation might develop where the three women would be together again. [Music continues playing over radio] [Guns firing] Unbelievable! I'm blind! My eyes! My eyes! [Hoestat crying] Amazing, and they got free? Yes, two girls were picked up by a British plane at a concealed airstrip near the camp. An escort squadron saw them safely across the channel, back to London. But what about the two girls, Martha Grossman and the wac lieutenant, where are they now? —oh, well, they're still around, Martha Grossman is married and living in the states. Had four children, at last report. [Johnson] Well, I certainly hope they kept their little stories a secret. Broadminded as I may be, I can't quite see how I could marry a woman that made love to half the German army. War or no war. —yes, quite. Well, my wife and I will look you up on our next trip to america. Well, I'll look forward to it. You didn't finish your story, what about the wac lieutenant? Well, I don't know, I haven't had a letter from her in over 20 years. [Car horn honking] That'll be my wife. Well, come, I'll walk out with you. [Military band music] Where to, governor? 42 Grosvenor square. Well, my dear, how was your day? Wonderful, darling. Simply, wonderful.
