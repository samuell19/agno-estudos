TO MARIE, MY BELOVED WIFE Four days… To think it was only four days ago… Good evening, Marie… How is she? Who? The only one… Her… Françoise! You know very well I don't see her anymore. -Where are you going? -To pack my suitcase. Are you leaving? Yes, for two days, for the garage in Bordeaux. You're not leaving! This chair! Hello? Miss, what time does the store close? Thank you. I'm just in time! I'm sorry, ma'am. I'm closing. Well, then, I'll be back… Tomorrow morning? Tomorrow only, the store won't be open. Monday, if you'd like. Miss! I have a hard time getting around… please. OK. Come in. No, I think you misunderstood me. I haven't walked in three years. My husband and I had a car accident. I'm sorry. For what? Oh! For that… Oh, you know, you get used to it. It's just a little harder to… get around, to get dressed… for a lot of things. I don't want to delay you any longer. I came to your store a long time ago to buy these gloves. And I would like to get another pair or something similar. What's wrong? Nothing… -Do you have a token? -At the register, sir. Oh, no… you see, my husband wouldn't like that at all. I think your phone's ringing. Hello, Françoise? What's going on? Your wife is here… I know. What did she say to you? We should stop seeing each other. Did she threaten you? What? Did she threaten you? I don't know. But it's not possible anymore, you were right. We have no hope. I never said that! You did, though. Three years ago, after her accident. OK, I'm coming. Give me a few days. I need to think, and so do you. I already have. You see, you didn't leave. Where is my revolver? Good thing you left her. I would have killed her. Where is my revolver? What was at stake for me? Conviction… They would have acquitted a poor disabled woman. Admit that you wish I was dead. At the moment, yes. If you can't stand me anymore, divorce me. Why don't you divorce me? Out of pity. Hear that? Out of pity! -Where are you going? -I'm leaving. I forbid you! I know you're not going to Bordeaux. You're right. I booked a room at Hôtel des Trois Couronnes. For that woman! But she won't be there, you'll be happy to hear. What are you doing? I'm keeping you from following me. The phone… give me the phone. First, tell me where you put my revolver. Give me the phone, so I can at least make a call! You've forgotten I sent the servants away. No, I didn't forget at all. I'll be back the evening after tomorrow. Try to find my revolver. Until then, bon appétit! And good night! CONDOLENCES To the cemetery. Wait a minute. What an ordeal… But I don't see her sister? Marie had a sister, right? -Yes, she did. -And she didn't bother to come? Poor Marie! She'll leave this world all alone. How is that possible? He didn't even bother to put on black socks. -No… -Yes! He didn't love her. Have you seen the New Yorker? No, as you can see, Anne did not come. Her sister? That's unbelievable! Stay strong… How sad! -And over there? -Where? The other funeral? Oh. Nothing too exciting. It's the police commissioner! I am sorry for your loss. Thank you, Commissioner. When you have time, come and see me. There is no rush. Just a formality. CONDOLENCES Don't worry. It'll all work out. -Mr. Paul Kastner. -Already! It wasn't that urgent. Please sit down. I hope you're not too mad at me about the hassle I've put you through these past few days. It's your job, Commissioner. Yes. And between us, very annoying, you know. I can't manage to see culprits everywhere. I'm not good at it, or just too optimistic, but enough about that… What do you think? I don't know. You see, if I was passionate about it, I'd think, "He just got confused." There's something there… but what? Nothing. My dear man, I'm sure it's nothing. It was just a guess. Incidentally, I have the results of the investigation. Simple mechanical failure, the handbrake must have released. Unless your wife forgot to put it on. One more thing we will never know. -No, we won't. -It's curious, isn't it? What? Well, this. A brake releases and that's it. How long were you married? Five years. A lot must have happened in five years. Meeting, falling in love! And then, everything else. What do you mean? Oh… Ups and downs, you know. I mean… Why are you asking me this? I thought the investigation was closed. Oh, it is! It is. Why did you call me in? Yes, well, we're just chatting away… I just wanted to tell you that Mrs. Kastner's car is at your disposal. Good. I'll have it scrapped. And give this back to you. The inventory's attached, if you want to check it. No, no, not necessary. No, don't worry. It's not loaded. -Is that all? -Yes, that's all. Good day, sir. Ah, I forgot… That gun, you still don't know if she was going to use it, or against whom? I already told you I don't know. Oh, OK. One more thing we will never know. Hmm… You don't have a room overlooking the street? Yes, but it will be noisier. This will do just fine. Miss Andrieux… Miss, I am sorry for your loss. We were beginning to fear you'd missed your plane. Anne, I am sorry to meet you under such circumstances. Good. "I, Marie Béatrice Kastner, "declare that I bequeath all my property to my husband, Paul Kastner, "with the exception of my jewelry and personal effects, "which I leave to my sister, Anne Andrieux. "In addition, my husband will have to pay her the sum of 500 francs per month "for her minor expenses…" That's ridiculous. You can never live off that. "500 francs per month, "with the understanding that she will live under the same roof as him. "She knows better than anyone else how to preserve my memory "and faithfully preserve my presence in our home. "These are my last wishes, "on the express condition that I not die a violent death. "If an accident befalls me, "I ask that an investigation be opened. "Accordingly, the present will would be declared valid "only if it is proven that my husband had nothing to do with my death. "All of my property would go to my sister, "in the probable event that he murdered me, "as he already attempted to do three years ago." Dated and signed. It was an accident. In which my sister lost her legs. You are a murderer, sir. You see, he doesn't even deny it. No, if I'm confused, it's because… I've never seen you before. You must admit that the resemblance is striking. Twins? My sister was two years older than me. I didn't kill her. As for the accident that left her paralysed, I was with her in the car, remember? It could have been me as well. It's strange that you were unharmed,. I'm sorry. -Never mind. -You are right. I mean… Commissioner Plouvier has informed me that the investigation is closed. So, everything is fine. My dear sir, you are rich. Hello, Françoise? I need to see you. No, I have to. I have to talk to you. I'll be right there. Sir? May I? Well, sir, I don't understand. -So, how does it feel? -What? To be a widower? Well, first of all, who are you? They call me Mr. Jean. You didn't answer me. Happy? Sir, I don't understand what you're saying and I'm in a hurry. Were you going out? I won't be long. And first of all, are you satisfied with my services? What services? I mean killing Mrs. Kastner, of course. But… it was an accident. This can't be. You didn't kill her. You wouldn't have done it yourself, would you? So… Why did you do it? You have to make a living, my dear sir. But don't worry, my price is quite reasonable. Think about it. I already have. I'll be right back. -For Mrs. Kastner. -What is this? It is a dress and a hat. It's just that… that my wife is dead. Ah… it costs 4,500. What do you want me to do with this? Don't know. They said to deliver it and get the payment. Well, put it down there. -To whom? -Carouse. -4,500 is it? -Yes, 4,500. Carouse? C-A-R-O- U-S-E. There you go. Goodbye, sir. -So, have you thought about it? -Yes. Either you told me the truth or you're crazy. In both cases, I have no choice. I'm calling the police. Oh, you'd be wrong. Women! Incorrigible! Even in death, they are spenders. Hello? You would have regretted it. For now, it's just an ordinary accident. But imagine if we start talking about a crime. Who would we accuse? Me? I did not have the honor of knowing your wife, so, no motive. You, on the other hand… I see you're starting to understand. Get out. Get out! Good. Today or tomorrow, I'm in no hurry. Take your time, think about it. I know we'll get along eventually. Hello, Mr. Kastner? This is Commissioner Plouvier. You'll think I'm harassing you, but I have another question. Well, I thought I had answered them all. No, no, no, that's just it, not this one. Besides your wife, do you know another Marie Kastner? No. Well, she just called me. I'm meeting her tomorrow morning at 9:00. What do you make of that? Well, nothing. And you? Yes… nothing. Anyway, don't let it keep you awake. Yes, OK. Have a good evening. It's late. I was worried. I'm here. You're in my arms. That's all that matters. Come in. Come sit down. -Françoise, look at me. -Yes? What's with you? You had to talk to me? -Yes. -So, speak. What did you want to tell me? I don't know anymore. That I love you… that I'm free… What's with you? -Paul… -Yes? -You have to answer me. -I'm listening. Was it really an accident? Why are you asking me this? No reason. Oh, no! That'd be too easy! Do you know something? Did he come see you? Who? The commissioner? Yes… the commissioner. No, I haven't seen him. Paul, I will never speak to you about this again, I swear, but I want to know. Did you kill her? I didn't have to. We shouldn't have talked about this. Where are you going? I'm leaving. What are you doing here? I'm at home. You didn't waste any time getting settled! My sister's last wishes are sacred. My little Marie… Here, drink. This will do you good. -What was it? -A sleep aid. It will help you sleep. You want to get rid of me, after my sister! Murderer! Yes, hello. I was waiting for your phone call. You want to know who the mysterious Ms. Kastner is? Well, yes. I don't know. She didn't show up to the meeting. If you ask me, she doesn't exist. She called you, though. Oh… yes, well… A bad joke. You know, we're used to it here. Goodbye. Oh, my God. Come on, I'll help you. -Come sit down. -Thank you. -What's wrong? -It's nothing. Here. Sit down here. -Should I call a doctor? -No, it's my diabetes. A pharmacy… please… Thank you! Mr. Moureu, quick! Someone is ill in my store. Thank you. Here you go. One right away. You can pay me later. -Thank you! -You're welcome. -Here. -Thank you. Why did you come up here? What if I died in your store? A dead body in a business always looks bad. -Rest a little bit. -No. I've already bothered you enough. Thank you. I forgot! This is all I have in the world. I'm in business, too. What do you sell? You'll never guess. Thank you. And thank you again for everything. I'd like some white-threaded gloves like this, miss. Yes? There is a Ms. Marie Kastner asking for you. Are you sure? That's what she said. Well, let her in. Madam, will you follow me? Ms. Marie Kastner. -Madam. -Commissioner, my life is in danger. Only in danger? This is unexpected. Please sit down. I thought I attended your funeral yesterday. Why are you trying to pass yourself off as your sister? Because it's the same thing. The proof that it's the same thing is that now he wants to get rid of me. You mean Anne? When are you going to arrest him? You don't mean that he murdered your sister, do you? Obviously I do. -Do you have a proof? -Of course. Last night, he poisoned me. -Excuse me? -Poisoned! That's proof, isn't it? What do you think? Well, I think that at first glance you've recovered well. No, but it's evidence, isn't it? Yes… well… as far as you're concerned, certainly. But I mean, for your sister… You wouldn't understand. Yes, yes, I could. In fact, I'm going to suggest something to you. Is something wrong, boss? No, nothing. I'm trying to understand. There's a customer who wants to try the station wagon. He insists on doing it with you personally. Personally? Yes, personally. Here, hold this for me. You'll see, it's jumpy. May I? Thank you. So, have you thought about it? No? I have, however, done you a great service. It wasn't a big job. She barely struggled. But still, I caught a cold while waiting for her car. Here, at the back of my neck. She didn't suffer. I mean, not much. Everything else is just a matter of staging. Get out. What will they think at the garage? Take me back, if you want to. I left my briefcase in your office. I hope no one opens it. At least, I hope for your sake. You're wasting your time. I won't pay. You are so funny, my dear man. Refusing won't do it. I have you. And the longer you delay, the harder I'll hold on to you. I'd like to know how. You'll understand later. Perhaps too late. If I pay you, I become your accomplice. You already are, my dear man. You have already started paying. Oh, not much… The way the price of hats and dresses are, I'm almost out. Four thousand five hundred francs. Carouse. Remember? C-A-R-O-U-S-E… Carouse. That's me. But I prefer that you call me Mr. Jean. It's nicer. Think about it. I'm always at the Café du Commerce at 6:00 p.m. I'm sure you'll come. -So, how was it? -Very jumpy indeed! I haven't decided yet. The truth is, I'm waiting for some money to come in. I think it's going to happen soon. Nice shot. May I? Please. Good! You're very good! Let me introduce myself. Jean Carouse. Commissioner Plouvier. A game? Uh, well… You have an appointment, right? My briefcase! It's here. You have state secrets in there? Even better. Ah… Letters from women. No, this is a man's handwriting. That's not what's important. Ah, look, toothbrushes. Yes. I am a rep. It's strange. I could imagine you in a funeral home. Both of us, Commissioner. Sorry about last night. It was my fault. You eat too much sugar. Why do you say that? I don't know… or rather, I do. I saw a diabetic this morning, but it doesn't matter. Paul… You know, Françoise, I didn't kill her. Is that what you were going to ask? I'm in trouble. Tell me. No, I have to get out of this alone. What will become of us? You're free now. Yes, but for how long? Anne? Who said you could enter my room? What's with the blonde hair? And what are you doing in that chair? As if you didn't know. You're the one who stuck me in it! Now, leave me alone. I want to sleep. In this room? Never! Listen up. From now on, every action you take, every word you say will be turned against you. For the past five years, I've let it happen, but now, it's over. -Anne. Listen to me. -There is no more Anne. Get out! Where do you want it? Nowhere. I never asked you to bring it here. You called me, right? Yes, but to take it to the scrapyard. OK, but you called me back to deliver it here. Me? Never. Must've been something else, then. What do I do? Put it in the garage. Ah, well, I'll be damned. You should know what you want! Ah, my friend… I thought you were going to scrap it. I changed my mind. What's wrong? -Nothing. I just got up. -At noon? -Yes, I'm not sleeping well right now. -And fully clothed? Yes, I took a sleep aid and then I went to bed like that. I'm bothering you with my questions. Yes, of course, especially with the trouble you're in. I don't know what you mean. Ah! That's strange… a police commissioner is really the last person you would confide in, and yet, he can make things right. You didn't kill your wife, did you? -You know I didn't! -Good. So, why not confide in us? I have nothing to tell you! Nothing! Ah? And yet, you're nervous. Your words, your gestures… obviously, it's confusing. Mind you, many times the culprits look innocent. Innocent people can look like you. It's confusing. It's a shame. I would have liked to help you. Wait! -All the same… -You know? That's a good one! I know what she told me. For the rest, it's easy to guess. She's crazy as hell. -Who? -Who? Your sister-in-law! -Is there anyone else? -No no. So, to get rid of her, I promised her to post a man in the park every night. I heard him. Who? Last night, when I got home. No, my dear sir, you should rest, because otherwise, you'll end up afraid of your own shadow. No, there was no one there. You don't have a prescription? I'm not going to go to the doctor for a sleep aid. -Well, look at here! Hello ! -Hello. -Are you better? -I'm better, thanks. What would you like? To show you our latest models. I'm not interested. Without even having seen them? -Mr. Moureu, please. -You can see that I am busy. Well, I'll wait. I shouldn't. Well, for this once… here. Ah, tell me… Do you know him? He lives across the street from me. Why? Just curiosity. A disease you catch quick in a small town. What are you doing? Come on, speak! You're scaring me. Don't you think we've talked enough? -Are you leaving? -I'm running late. Where are you going? No questions. No more questions anymore! I decided never to let anyone bother me ever again. Not even you. Got to admit I chose a good place. In any case, it's unexpected. We'll be more relaxed here than at the cafe. Commissioner Plouvier is a charming man. -Do you know him? -Very well. I prefer to leave him out of our little business. Did you have my wife's car delivered to the house? Of course. You're wondering why? Not at all. Either you disappear from my life, or I press charges. And you'll be in for 20 years. As far as I know, you're the one who killed her. And that ends as soon as I want it to. I warned you. The longer you wait, the better I have you. And I never leave things to chance. I've done some good work the past three days, if I do say so myself. Do you want to know how you killed your wife? Ah, because I did it now? You were supposed to pay, sir! No. Let me explain. And I'll tell you why I didn't want the car to be scrapped. This is the main proof of your guilt. Yes, and I have many others, but this one is essential. To make sure the car would break down, you cut the fan belt. This is absurd. It's still in there. I don't think so, but let me continue. Your wife knew you'd booked a room at a nearby inn. When you left, she followed you. At least she thought she was following you. In reality, you were driving behind her. You knew what was going to happen. At the first hill, the car starts to heat up, the engine starts to overheat. Of course, it was running without a belt. She stops. The battery is dead, of course. So, you arrive and… And you, during this time? I was in my bed, in Paris. No, of course, I was on the road and did all the work. Only I didn't leave a trace. While I… Every day, a few more. So, what do you prefer? That I send the evidence to the police? Or you pay and we don't talk about it? You're bluffing. A bit of advice. When you get home tonight, check if the fan belt is in place. If so, then you can call my bluff, but not before. -He's not here, miss. -I'm here! No need to insist. He's not here! -If he were here, I'd tell you. -I'm here! You can just call back… Hello? Hello, Françoise? You're an awful bastard! I worked out what you were doing at mine this afternoon! I would've given the letters back, since they are so compromising, or I would've burned them. Which letters? -It's grease! -No, it… You tampered with my car! Françoise, listen. Murderer! Don't touch me! Commissioner! Commissioner, I'm up here! Come quick! I have a proof! -Commissioner! -I'm here. Come upstairs. I'm on the second floor. You're not the commissioner! No. One of his subordinates, no doubt. He had promised to personally look after my safety. He is a very busy man. Well… look. I hope they believe me now and arrest him. It's grease. He tried to tamper with my car again. That's proof, isn't it? Take me to my room. You can talk. My husband is gone. -Your husband? -Of course! He went to see that witch again! Would you be so kind as to stand up? Me? But I haven't walked in three years. I didn't know. I'm sorry. Anne… May I call you Anne? Or if you prefer, Marie? It doesn't matter. It's the same thing. You wouldn't understand. I do understand, very well. Really? I'm so glad you understand it's the same. Of course. So he needs to be arrested right now, because he wants to get rid of us. And I don't want him to touch my sister. Do you understand? Are you going to arrest him? Yes, calm down. -Where are you going? -To arrest your husband. Don't leave me alone! I'm afraid. I'm going with you. But you can't… My legs… Don't leave me alone! I'm afraid he's going to kill me. Do you have a weapon? A shotgun, a revolver? No… Ah… yes! In my husband's room, next door, there's a revolver. In the dresser! Come on. You stay here and don't move. -Yes? -And if he returns, -you shoot. -Yes. Do you know how to use it? Yes… no. You press here, like this. Do you understand? -Yes. -Good. So, if someone tries to get in, -you shoot, OK? -Yes. And don't forget… you have the commissioner's permission! Hello? Police? At 72 avenue des Chênes, a crazy woman is shooting at passers-by. Come quickly. Go away! What's all this about letters? I don't want to see you again. It's despicable to have taken them back like that… after! The letters I wrote? And that were there, in that drawer. -Where are they? -Come on, Paul… I didn't touch them. No one else has ever been up here. Unless… My raincoat… -You know him? -Yes. I'm beginning to understand. -Come on, let's go. -Where? To the house. -Watch out, Commissioner. -I know what I am doing. Two. Three. Four. Five. Well… With the one she shot before we were called, that's six. That's all of 'em. Let's go! Wait here. Ah, it was you, Commissioner. You scared me. You took your time. I have all the evidence. Me too. -Get out. -Why? Get out, I said. Don't stay here. There he is! Mr. Paul Kastner, you are under arrest. But… You murdered your wife. I have all the evidence. If you want to go upstairs to get some personal belongings, I'll go with you. Murderer! I'm sorry, but we had to calm her down. What's with you? You're making a strange face. You didn't really think I was arresting you? Then, what are you doing here? Well, among other things, I'm saving your life. She wanted to shoot you. Maybe two or three of my men, too. Unbelievable… So, now you understand why I came this morning. Here! Here you go. I forgot your revolver. That went well. We managed to avoid the worst. Come by the police station tomorrow morning for the internment formalities. OK, let's go. Who's there? The belt is gone, and the headlights were on. Of course… from the moment he arrived, I did what he wanted, all he had to do was take it. It took me a while, but now I understand his M.O. I just had to think about it. From the start, he's done everything backwards. First, he kills, and when he has found a victim, all he has to do is cobble together a murderer from the evidence. Tomorrow, the battery would've been dead, just like he said. I'm done, Françoise. I don't have a choice. -Are you going to call the police? -No. -Pay him? -No, not that either. I'm gonna kill him! There's no other solution. He's done everything to turn me into Marie's killer. And now, it's come true, or so it seems. -With his evidence, I'm the guilty one. -What evidence? I'm not sure I can trust him. -First, he has the letters. -They go back more than three years. Yes, they're not dated. But a man who writes "whatever it takes, I'll get rid of my wife," if the woman in question is fine, it's fine. But imagine… imagine if people think I wrote them a month or a week before Marie's death. In this case, believe me, the slightest physical evidence you could add to this would convince people. Any kind of evidence. A fan belt, grease on a jacket, a handkerchief, a check… -A check? -Oh, yeah. You don't know about that. But I know the commissioner will ask me why I wanted to buy Carouse's silence if I am as innocent as I claim to be. Come on, I'll explain. You know, Françoise, I've been thinking about it, and I'm stuck. You have to help me. How? By killing him? No, I'll take care of that. First of all, I need an alibi. And for that, I need you. So, did tonight clarify your decision? I'll pay. Wait a moment, I'll close the window. Now, I can hear you better. You were saying? Since you have everything to prove how I killed my wife, I am willing to pay. Good. Five million in one lump sum. That won't be too much, will it? Five? Old francs, of course! Well, I'll manage. When and where? Uh… I can't until ten o'clock tonight. That late? I need to get the money together and… I have family issues. Yes, yes, I know, your sister-in-law. She was becoming a bit of a nuisance. Ah, it was you… She tended to want to get our deal over with quickly. I'd rather get paid off before she turned you in. Ten o'clock where? Well, same as yesterday. At the cafe? No, no… in the park. Why not at your home? These days, Commissioner Plouvier could show up at any moment. He scares you, huh? Scares me enough. Ten o'clock in the park, although I feel it's a bit isolated… but I'm wrong to worry. Of the two of us, I'm the killer, right? I'll have all the evidence in my briefcase, and I'll put in the recording I just made of our conversation. Listen. Since you have everything to prove how I killed my wife, I am willing to pay. It's not very legal, I know, but it always impresses a jury. Have the money… and if you have an ulterior motive, I don't know… let's say, a sting… give it up. Two sleeper cars on tonight's train. Thank you, goodbye. You're lucky. There aren't many people taking the train this season. You said Miss Noblet, right? Yes, Françoise Noblet… -N-O… -B-L-E-T. The second ticket will be for Paul Kastner. K-A-S… Sorry, I used the same surname. Can't you do it again? Does it matter? No. Departure from Gare de Lyon, 8:45 p.m. Thank you. Right here, and that's it. I wish it hadn't come to this. Yes, but you had no choice. Once she starts shooting at people, it becomes my business. Anyway, a residential care home is not a prison. Alright. No, believe me, you should rest. You look very tired. Maybe a change of scenery, anyway. Yes, I've been thinking about that. Thank you, Commissioner. Mr. Moureu! -Are you closing already? -I'm going on a trip with my friend Paul Kastner. Do you know him? I know him well. But don't repeat that. People are so gossipy. Do you want the tickets? No, definitely not! If the inspector asks you for them… I didn't tell you. They're both in my name. What? Yes… I didn't want to insist about it. It would have looked strange. I made up for it. I told Moureu we were leaving together. -Who? -Moureu, the pharmacist. But never mind… I'LL BE RIGHT BACK MATTEI RENTAL CARS Anybody here? Anybody here? We're gonna miss it… I need the ticket. You'll be seen on the train. That's what matters. Come on. -Oh, I'm sorry. -Oh, no, no, no. Don't worry. Don't worry. It's my fault. Please forgive me. And my other pair is in Nice. Well, it's better than breaking your leg. -If you ladies would follow me. -Off to a great start. Oh, excuse me, sir, but without my glasses, it's like I'm blind. Your tickets, please? Here you are. -Three and four? -No, one and two. One and two… Ah, you'll be over the wheels. It doesn't matter. Some people can't sleep. I wonder why, because… ouch! I can't see anything at all. Have a good evening. -Yes, thank you. -Thank you. It couldn't have gone worse. Who saw me? Nobody. Good! Are you crazy? No, Paul. I've dreamed of leaving with you for three years. Three years I've imagined this, you and me on a train, alone, with no one between us. And now, it's happening. We're leaving! -You're leaving. -Both of us! Now's not the time. Come on, give me the revolver. I beg you, Paul. Don't go. It's too dangerous! Are you out of your mind? I just wanna be happy! That's all! That wouldn't last more than two days. If I don't show up tomorrow, the police will have everything they need to arrest me. Is that what you want? Paul, stay. You rang the bell? Yes, two scotches, please. Yours "on the rocks," darling? One with still water and one with ice, please. Air-Inter flight 704 to Marseille-Marignane, last call. Sir… -Ah, Mr. Verrier? -Yes. -We've already called you. -Oh. Mathilde, the chair for this gentleman. -You don't have any luggage? -No. It'll be much faster with the chair. Thank you. DESTINATION TO MARSEILLE Train to Toulon, Saint-Raphaël, Cannes, Nice, Ventimiglia, all aboard please. Breakfast, croissants, sandwiches… You are a sweetheart. Thank you. Oh! Shit! Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, a nice tie. Is it silk? -Yes. -You'll need to use lemon juice. No, thank you, it's fine. Sorry, I'm mixed up. So, the briefcase? We're screwed. THE HANGMAN OF SAINT -CLOUD SUICIDE OR MURDER? SAINT-CLOUD HANGMAN THE INVESTIGATION CONTINUES Is there anything? No, nothing. What did I tell you? The first day, five columns. Yesterday, ten lines. And today, nothing. It's over. Do you believe that? If you went out for a while, instead of staying in here, you'd see. No one talks about it anymore. Case closed. Until the day the briefcase is found. Why? Because it also contains my confession. Recorded. But you didn't kill her. And he's not you either, so… Maybe you're right. You need to stop thinking about it. Anyway, you have your alibi. Don't think about it. Stay here. May I? So? -How does that feel? -What? Well, to be rid of him. Uh, sir, who are you? Moureu. The pharmacy. You know it? Moureu Père & Fils. I'm the son. But you didn't answer me. Happy? Did you kill him? Let's say he committed "suicide." I prefer that. I thought for a moment you would save me the trouble. Me? Never. Come on, sir. Don't use that tone between us. Keep this in mind. The tape and the letters are now in my hands. -What are you waiting for? -A quid pro quo. I caught a cold the other night on your lawn. That was you? I was trying to understand. My father was buried the same day as your wife. But what's the link? Carouse, of course. He killed your father, too? At first, it's simple. We have two dead people and only one killer. But watch out. A murderer without a motive. So, in the very short term, two culprits… you and me. When did you decide to kill him? The day I thought you were giving up. How did you find out? By keeping my ears open. The night you made your decision with Françoise… You know her? Very well. You were talking about it in the next room. Were you there? Every night. But at certain point, you closed the window… The next day, when I saw you taking the train, I thought you were afraid. I didn't understand that this was your alibi. And was it you who… knocked me out? Yes, I thought it was him. He came two minutes later. You must admit I did you a great service. That has a price… especially this. What are you demanding in return? An alibi for that night… Just an alibi. But quickly, I am in a hurry. We have just what you need. And we need to be quick. Give me your tie and put this one on. Quickly, come on, I'll explain. Come quickly. Come and sit here. -Hello. -Hello. -Am I disturbing you? -No, not at all. Of course I am. Police are always disturbing people. It seems the whole world has something to feel guilty about. Nice cannon. I beg your pardon? Oh, yes, that's right. You don't play pool. We call it a "cannon", when the cue ball hits two other balls. Why did you do this? Are you talking to me? -Or to me? -To both of you. And this question that bothers you so much, I've also asked 23 other people, the list of whom I have in my pocket, people Carouse offered the same deal to. You all had reason to get rid of him. He killed 25 people? Ah! 25 people, no! Not exactly, not exactly. He had 25 victims, one of whom committed suicide to escape the blackmail. It was after this suicide that the police became interested in Carouse. So, you knew about this for two years, and you didn't arrest him? Well, the police can only act when charges are pressed. Have you had it long? -What? -This… this chest here… It's always been here. It was my wife's. It's curious. It's nice… It's very nice. What was I saying? Ah, yes! Charges should have been filed. Then, Carouse would still be here, locked up, but alive. And I wouldn't have to ask Mr. Moureu what he was doing on the night of Saturday the fourth to Sunday the fifth. But why me? Answer my question. I was on a train. We were together. Ah… Oh, well, yes. Bit of a stretch for an alibi, but still… Where were you going? Cannes. At this time of year? The water's cold, isn't it? Can I see the tickets? Well… I think I threw them away. No, darling, they're at my house. You'll have to get them for me. I should tell you they're both in my name. Ah… and of course, nobody saw you! That's not true, Commissioner. We had a lot of run-ins with the sleeper car attendant. Are you listening to me? -This is yours. -What is it? A hair! If his alibi satisfies you, will you ask me for mine? I warn you that I don't have one. What's wrong? I don't feel well. I'll go alone. Give me the keys. Where did you put them? -What? -The tickets! In my desk. OK, I'll be right back. Go straight to the police station, I'll meet you there. He's jumpy, huh? Everyone's jumpy here. Except for me! And you know why I'm so calm? Well, tell us. Billiards. There's nothing like it to keep you in control… billiards. You should start playing. Thank you. I'll think about it. Don't worry about it. If you have told the truth, Mr. Moureu has nothing to fear. You should have arrested Carouse. For what reason? 25 murders. Is that not enough for you? Carouse has never killed anyone. At the time of your wife's death, he had never heard of her, nor of Mr. Moureu's father. But that's impossible… Do you know how he learned of their deaths? By reading the obituaries. But not just out of curiosity like everyone else. As a professional who lived off the death of others. You're going to say I'm exaggerating, but that chest there… What's wrong with the chest? Well, I'm interested in this trunk. Yes, since I've been here, it's all I see. I had the same one at home, at my parents' house. Where was I…? The obituaries. Oh, yes, the obituaries. In your wife's, it said "tragically deceased." Something to think about. Usually, it's murders that are made to look like natural deaths. But Carouse was the opposite. He turned a car accident into a murder. You know the rest. Why didn't you press charges? I don't know. Well, I'll tell you. And that was Carouse's strength. Because you didn't love your wife. I won't let you… Of course, you wouldn't have killed her, but still, one day or another, you must have wished her dead. Never. Anyway, you can confess now, at this point. Yes, in a moment of anger… And that was enough. Not to kill her, but to give you once and for all a guilt complex powerful enough to let Carouse manipulate you when the time came. Why didn't you pay? I never intended to. It was cheaper to kill him. Are you arresting me? You? No, absolutely not. Of all possible culprits, you are the only one who doesn't tempt me. I don't understand anymore. A park at night is not as deserted as you think. There are rounds. We saw you get knocked out. Were you there? Ah, no. That would have been too good. You wouldn't have got out like that. You might say the police aren't very good, but still, I would've asked you what you were doing there. It was a guard who saw you. By the time he ran to the phone to inform us, Carouse had been hanged. By whom? I don't know. You really didn't see anything? I was passed out. I know. Of all the culprits, you are the only one who could not have murdered him. But I am forgetting Mr. Moureu. He must also be eager to prove his innocence to me. Mind you, they're all like that, I understand. Personally, I would have congratulated him for getting rid of Carouse. Yes… well. Oh, speaking of getting rid of things… if you don't do anything with this, now that your wife is no longer here… I'd like it. Do think of me. When you have something in your head… Not to use it, because you never know what to put in this kind of thing. But anyway, I'd like it. I am a romantic. I promise you we'll think about it for the trunk, OK? Goodbye! I was waiting for him to leave. Am I disturbing you? -But… how can… -How do you feel? Well… completely well. I'm healed. I'm leaving. Are you going back to New York? My plane takes off in 45 minutes. -I came to thank you. -Me? Thanks to you… I was looked after wonderfully It's incredible, isn't it? Look at my legs! After so many terrible years, stuck in a chair. But now, that's over. I can walk… I can walk! Look! THE END Subtitle translation by: Kathleen Kownacki
