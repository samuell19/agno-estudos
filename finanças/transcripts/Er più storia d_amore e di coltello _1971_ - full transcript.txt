Let’s go play! Shepherd, here in Rome, goat’s milk is bad. - It gives diarrhea. - Also your wine. When you're drunk, if you shit yourself you don't care. Yes, all right! Did you hear? The Best is getting out of prison today! No fucking way! Fresh, cold water! Fresh water for who needs a drink. Refresh yourself with the water of Rome. Water for those who are thirsty! Fresh water of Rome. Women, run to buy it! The best water in the world! Read all that happened today in the newspaper. They freed Nino, The Best of Borgo. He was released for insufficient evidence! Thank you, Nino! Grandpa, how did you know it was me? I don’t have eyes but my ears work well. I could tell it was you from your footsteps. And I can also tell you that they are footsteps of a knife. Welcome back, Nino. This is how you see friendship. Just to not displease any of you. I’ll give your money back. If you want to deduct it, it's two shaves a day. Welcome back, Nino. Nino... Bite. I told you to bite, spy! Swallow. Think yourself lucky because you are a coward. I will not dirty my knife with a coward. He is coming! Augustarello, Nino found out he went to jail because of you. Listen to Ignazio. Run away from the kitchen or you will die. I am not afraid of anyone and I will stay as long as I want. Good morning everyone. Everyone but one. Nino, how are you? We were all waiting for you. Thank God you are here. You have gotten fat! The air of the prison suits me. What will you drink? - The usual. - I will take care of it. When I was here last, almost a year ago, it smelled like wine in here. Today I come back and it smells like skunk here. - Who are you talking about? - About you and those who don’t tell you the same. - Skunk. - Skunk. Dancing and singing. Enough! Augustarello. You deserve to get stabbed. But you are young, beautiful and a dickhead. So I will postpone your execution. Drink. It’s good, it’s from Frascati! Drink. - Pigs! - Pigs. The marshal is coming. - He is already here. - Good morning, marshal. - Good morning. - Good morning. - Marshal. - Ciuffini, search these two. I would never go around with a knife in my pocket. Do you want a little bit of wine? - Nothing. - Obviously. Who knows why when pigs are around knives go hide in the strangest places. Like this, for instance. - Whose knife is this? - A stranger. - This place is always so crowded! - Really? I was looking for two people that were about to kill each other. - I think I have found them. - What are you talking about? Why do you think that? We were drinking together as good friends, Augustarello and I. - Right, Augustarello? - I can testify to that. Everything is settled then! You spent a year in prison for that game that ended up with a stabbing. That was a mistake. He cut himself with a broken bottle. A broken bottle like this and with your fingerprints on it. Fingerprints are a fantastic thing! - Who invented them? - That wouldn’t have been enough if we didn't have the help of an informant. It was the Chinese, the antique dealer. This is what everybody says. But who told the Chinese? He is convinced it was you. Augustarello? - I would suspect everyone. - Really? Even my mother, but not him. Augusto Di Lorenzo, why could you do this? Because of Rosa Turbine, a very lovely girl you fell for. What are you talking about? Rosa is like a blind person. She doesn’t see anyone. She has eyes for me only. Who takes a woman away from me? Not to brag, but every child in this neighborhood could call me dad! You are being a smart ass! I did my duty, I searched you and talked to you. As long as you'll keep doing like this and think that you can do justice on your own... We will be men of honor and not just sheep as you want us to be. Our law is the real one and also the oldest. You can get up to five years of jail for recidivism. Five years is a long time. Who knows if Rosa Turbine would wait for you that long! Where are you going? It isn’t over! You have no way to go, Augustarello. I will kill you and use your guts as garland for Carnival. Nino, what are you doing? Scoundrels! Put that knife away! You don’t have to go back to jail. - If you love me, knife down. - Do you let women defend you? Shut up, imbecile! You deserve to get stabbed! I don’t want my man to go back to jail! Rosa, go home. Rosa, don’t get into this, this is the honor code! Fuck you and all your relatives! - These are men things. - What men? You are just cowards! And you should’ve made them stop earlier. Enough, or it will end bad for you too. Really? I’ll show you. Men of honor, look. This is a double show! What are you doing? Are you coming with me? Then I will pull up my dress and show them what is courage! - May Saint Antonio protect you all. - Come in, friar. - That's a good show. - What do you want to do? - Knife down and come with me. - No! I count up to three and then I will show you everything! One. Two. And... What bad luck! We were just about to look at the beauty! What should I do? I should spank you. Try and see me poking your eyes out. I rule here. Try doing what you did today again and you will see! Nino, you don’t rule over Rosa Turbine! Of course, you are my master, my lady. Stop being silly, go to work. My master! After one year of jail you went to kill Augustarello right away. - You don’t care about me. - You make me laugh. Was I supposed to come to you and say: "Rosa. What should I do?" Are you ashamed of yourself? It is better to stab someone again instead of going to church and swearing not to stab anyone again? Rosa, I am The Best of Borgo. Even the Virgin Mary would be upset if I made such a statement. Do you defend the poor people of the neighborhood? A man is a man and must act like a man. - This is why God made a man. - For what? To be a man. Or he would’ve made him a female. You are lucky I wasn’t born a man or I would’ve stabbed you too. Rosa, I like you. You are the perfect woman for me! - Come in. - Excuse me if I disturb you. This is more like a bother. - Who told you to sit down? Stand up! - Yes. Why are you always so mean to me? I do the interests of the law too. No. Do your own interests. Being an informer is lucrative. What did they do to you to make you hate them so much? They take it out on me because I take the law’s side. You are a perfect citizen! Sign here. - I want to check that... - Yes, yes. Do. Being a loan shark means being legal? I'm not a loan shark, I'm a benefactor. Many people would die of hunger and sickness if they didn’t have the help of the Chinese. Where I am from, we call this dark charity. - Your conscience is really dark. - What conscience? All these criminals always sucked my blood. - It not fair! - No sign and go. I sign, but it’s not fair. The service of today is worth more. You don’t pay me enough! The information you gave today did not help us and so you won't be paid. Nino and Augustarello were just drinking together. You are too good. These criminals should be treated with more violence. You must show them who rules, break their bones. Good policemen must beat people - or they won’t have a good career. - Listen, you bloodsucker. I will break your bones! I will show you who rules! Do you understand? Go away! Always protect me! What are you doing? Go away! Out! Women, serve yourself. How fresh is this fish! The best fish for the best customer. Here, take it. - 250. - Nino. Thank God you came. His fish is not like yours. Of course! What fish could Gnappetta have? He looks like a cod to me. Fresh fish! Nino’s fish looks alive. Mom! - Where are you going? - To Mass. - I'm asking the grace of Saint Rita. - Isn’t Saint Antonio better? No. He gets too many requests. Saint Rita is a new Saint, she will help me right away. - Let’s go! - What? - Nothing. - What happened? Why are you crying? - For Totarello. - Did he disrespect you? No, it’s the opposite. Velia, explain yourself. You are making me upset! Nino, Totarello never touches me! - What does that mean? - He doesn’t want me. He has never tried to touch me. Never, in three years! This is new. Do you think that he likes men? Nino, what are you talking about? They can ear us! I have to marry him. What if he doesn’t work? Let me understand. The breasts, the thighs... - Did he ever try to... - He never even touched my arms! Did you ever leave them alone? You shouldn’t ask me these questions! I know my job. The other day I left them home alone to play cards. - And? - Nothing! He fell asleep. - He fell asleep? - Yes, he fell asleep. - No! Stop! - Come on! - Enough! - A little bit... Are you leaving? - Come on! - Are you leaving me like this? I don’t like it. Do you understand? What came to your head? Damn the misery! Damn the tourists. Come on... Here. Eat! You are making me sick! - Totarello. - What are you doing here? I came to see if you changed your team! I must talk to you. I don’t understand. But I understand. Totarello. You don’t fool me. You aren’t a faggot and neither impotent. Why do you get engaged with my sister, make arrangements for the wedding and then you don’t do your job? I thought you were a man of honor worthy of The Best. Tell me clearly. Are you trying to fight with me? What fight? I don’t want to fight with the king of knives. We are not getting married because things aren’t going well. I am not making good money. This son of a bitch eats everything I make. I can’t have a wedding like that, like a stingy ass. What would people say? The King is coming! Long live the king! How much I like the king. How ugly is the Chinese! Almost as ugly as ours. Respect the foreign guest. Italy has a precise aim over China. Miss Rosa, what a nice surprise! You are even better than the surprise. Here comes someone who doesn't want to see us talking. - Marshal, don’t apologize. - Move! So? You go out and get flirty? - And with a policeman. - Are you jealous? Yes I am jealous. You are my woman and no one can look at you. No one looks at me anymore. What do you think? I bite the pillow at night. I am tired of sleeping alone. Rosa, I tried many times, you always say no to me! I will say yes but in front of a priest. Talking about a priest, that bride gown you had... The white one made of silk, do you still have it? Of course. - With embroideries and pearls. - Yes. And the embroidered veil? Yes, why? Take it out and iron it. Nino! What are you talking about? Are you for real? I am serious, yes. You finally decided? Honey, how much I love you! I feel like crying for what I have in my heart. Look, I’m crying. Why are you crying? What did you think? My sister is getting married! The dress is for her. It’s like if the sister of a king is getting married. No, it’s like if the sister of a big piece of shit is getting married! Totarello will not come anymore. We have been waiting so long! - So? - Totarello isn’t coming. Are you making fun of us? The priest, the best men, the bride! We are ready and you are here getting drunk! I can’t, I can’t do it! Stand up and let’s go to the Church. Don’t get upset, Nino. Sit down. I want to tell you the truth. Explain this mystery. Careful, I am getting upset! The thing is... Your sister... - She doesn’t excite me. - What? - What can I do? - You'd have thought of this before. - What’s wrong with my sister? - Maybe the mustache! You are marrying my sister! How can I? What if I don’t get a hard on tonight? I don’t care about this, think about someone else, someone that you like. There is one. Can I think about her? - Of course. Who is she? - Rosa. - Aren’t you getting offended? - No. I’ll just beat you up! Antonio Cerino, do you want to take Velia Patroni as your beloved wife? You must answer, son. Do you want to take Velia Patroni as your beloved wife? Yes. Yes, yes. Yes. Velia Patroni, do you want to take Antonio Cerino as your beloved husband? - Yes. - I pronounce you married. In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. - Hi, Nino. - Hi. I got the bike back. He didn’t want me to give it back. - And so I had to beat him up. - You did well. - Take it to the sacristan. - All right. I won’t do anything else. - You don’t steal to those who work. - I need it, my wife is sick. Have her cured. Say that you fell on a rusted nail. Thank you, Nino. We have alive fish! Come, people! We have alive fish. - We have alive fish! - You scream too much. If you scream so much the fish will die. See how beautiful is your mask? This is me? I thought it was you. No one will serve me? I am here just for you! I am ready to give you all that you want. You just have to say it. I have the best fish in Rome and it’s all for you. - Tell me what you want. - I want a small mullet. A small mullet? You’ll need a big one. You look crabby today. Mullet and crabs together are a great dish! - I will give you that too. - You make me have the chills! - Good morning Marshal! - Good morning. See what it means to have a shop with two entrances? Serve the lady! Use her some respect. Did you do me that favor? If you go to the priest you will have news about the stolen bike. Could it be possible to know the name of the thief? I can tell you the name of the song but not who sings it. I see. There is also a purse stolen to a Dutch tourist here in your neighborhood. I am sorry, but purses, money, jewels... nothing to do with those. Take that fish away! They are bringing precious currency. Italy lives out of tourism. And you are Italian as well. What will they think about us abroad? They should thank us because we will return the woman. - What are you saying? - You have convinced me. - You will have the purse back. - Good job. Thank you. Empty. When Garibaldi came to town, I joined his army. He shook my hand and gave me this red shirt. Do you want to buy this shirt? I am in need. What should I do with it? It’s not even carnival. - Garibaldi gave it to me. - Garibaldi gave it to you! Garibaldi? So this is antique stuff. I was Garibaldi’s drummer. We did many battles together. - I’d play the drum. - All right! Don’t do that or the cat will get scared. I will keep it here, if I sell it I will give you half a lira. - Half a lira for a patriotic shirt? - Hurry. Don’t make me lose my patience! Get undressed. - You smell! - A second! All in pieces! How smelly! - What happened? - Marshall! I was helping this man. I am selling my shirt because I am in need. - The red shirt? How much? - Half a lira. No, I was keeping it here waiting to sell it. - If I sold it... - You are a beast. You don’t respect anything. Give him the half lira. Aren’t you ashamed? I am, but I am hungry! I am so hungry that it hurts. But it doesn’t hurt you to sell such an important item? Our fathers fought for that! - Give him the money! - Thank you. - Shame. - The shirt. - No! Go home. - Be good. You remind me of Giuseppe. I was his drummer. Can I be your drummer? No, please! Go, go home and keep your shirt. Go! I gave him half a lira and he keeps the shirt as well? I will take it off the fine I will give you because this shop doesn’t respect the hygienical rules. - There is a bit of dust. - How gross! - I need to clean. - It stinks here. - Full of animals, mosquitoes, flies. - Flies? There are many flies! I can’t stand flies. There is one here! Now there is one less. Clean, Chinese, clean. Let’s go! Rosa. You are so beautiful! You are the best star. The other stars go hide. With your eyes you wounded more hearts then all the knives in Rome. If someone doesn’t agree that you are the most beautiful woman, I swear I will kill him. Augustarello, today I am nervous. You don’t believe me! Mortician, come here. Say that Rosa Turbine is the most beautiful girl in the world. Are you crazy? I don’t know Rosa Turbine! Say what I said or I will break your bones! Rosa Turbine is the most beautiful girl in the world. No, you will have to scream. Everybody must hear you. Rosa Turbine is the most beautiful girl in the world. Did you hear him? Now repeat it. Did you all hear that? What are you talking about? Go away! Die! You and Rosa Turbine! I don’t care. I am better than him. I am richer than him, I would marry you right away, and you prefer that fishmonger! You are better than a roach. A roach? What do you mean? What do you think that a female roach would prefer between you and a roach? - A roach. - I answered you. What are you doing? Learn to play cards! - The dead man arrived! - I want to tell you something. I am sorry to disturb you. I thought you would like to know that Augustarello is at Rosa’s ironing shop. And you say that I am not a friend of yours! - Chinese. - Yes? Come here. A spy must always be paid. Augustarello, I am busy. I have so much to do I can’t waste time. Go away. Your wish is my command but I will be back. I will be back because I want to convince you that I'm best for you. Stop. Your mother is a bitch. My mother is dead. Then you are the son of a dead bitch. Come in. - Look, I am disarmed. - Me too. I don’t want to stab you, I have something else in mind. Nino! Nino! Don’t be stupid. Nino! Now you know what it means to be beaten up with a fish. Velia came back! I’m back! Mom, I’m back! Mom! I’m back. You are back. Totarello, how did the honeymoon go? How do you think it went? Why all these people is here? Where is Nino? Inside. He is fighting with Augustarello. All right. Velia, get down. I must take care of the horse. I can’t move, I am tired. I can’t do this, you must help me. - Did you get yourself a slave? - I am your wife! - I am your wife! - And he is your husband. You must respect him and don’t bother him. Do you understand? Let’s go. Say that you fell in a bush. - Come on! - Look! Brother in law, you are always the bestest. It’s "the best". Learn grammar. Yesterday it was still beating. - Here, seven hectograms of heart. - How much, Bartolo? It’s 19 and 19 cents. Couldn’t it be one lira? Augustarello, did you fall into a black currant bush? No, he fell for a bush. He was looking for troubles and he found them. Really? My God! Good evening. Bartolo, I am not looking for troubles. I will kill him. I will kill him! Shut up! You couldn’t kill a lamb. You are only capable of dishonor and dirtying the name of this family. Especially mine. The Best of San Giovanni! Pietro, Alfredo, this thing must be fixed now. Let’s go. Where do you want to go? Nino is mine and I will kill him! I swear I will do it. Who are you kidding? We know you. You are not brave. Stay in the shop and let us do the job. What will the people of Borgo will think of me? What they have always thought about you, that you are a jerk. - Seven. - Twenty. - Four. - Seven. - Nine. - Seven. - Nine. - Seven. - Four. - Seven. - Five. - No! Augustarello’s brothers are looking for a fight. Isn’t the butcher The Best of San Giovanni? Yes. To come to mess with us here, he needed a declaration. It depends. There aren’t knives involved, so this changes everything. They came to avenge their brother. You are The Best’s vice, what are you supposed to do? I can’t intervene, it’s up to Nino. - Frascatano, where is Nino? - He's fucking around. Where is your boss? He isn’t here. Go look for him. Did you hear what he said? Go, run! Calm down, brother. In the respectable families, when you are looking for someone, you leave your business card. What a smell! Maria, run! Come down with a big basket! There’s free fish! Run! Come down. Run, people! Fish is free today. Mr. Nino! Mr. Nino! Run! A little bit of discretion! The Di Lorenzo’s brothers came to the shop. - I don’t care! - They are breaking everything. - What? - Yes, all the fish is on the floor. They broke the shop windows! - What are they doing? - Destroying the shop. - Really? - I swear. Let’s go. Nino! What should I do? Go to hell! Damned you. Go! Scram! What’s going on? No way... Good job! Very well! Mazzini and Garibaldi under your feet. Stuff thrown on the floor. Broken doors. Many crimes have been committed here. You dirty public property, that was already very dirty. Breaking and entering. Defacing national heroes. That's even worse. All these have a price, my dear people. The offended law will defend itself from the offenders with a monetary fine. I will fine you for 12 lira and 30 cents. What name should I write? Who did this mess? It was me. Bartolo Di Lorenzo. But if you think that I will pay the fine, you are wrong. I will not pay, even if I’ll get a life sentence. - Only one should pay here... - Nino. What is fair is fair. When the Di Lorenzo brothers come here, they are my guests. If they use something, steal or break something, I always pay for them. I wanted to renovate my shop. Thank you, Bartolo. You can tell me, I’ll take care of it. How much? It’s 12,30. Damn! - Pay, Chinese. - Me? Pay or the marshal will get upset. I could get upset too and your shop would get in the middle of it. I have nothing to do with this! Think about it, and you will see it too. Does this tattler have to do with this? - Yes. - He does! You're paid by the government. So, when the government asks for money, - you give it to them. - Calm down! - He is in a hurry. - If you insist... It’s 12,30. Here is 30. 12. All right. You were lucky! Silence! Wait because I will be back soon. When I come back I want to see everything calm, clean and fixed. - Let’s go. - Of course. I always obey the law, don’t worry. Bartolo. We will square up in a different way. The law of honor is an ancient thing. We are even, for me we can also make peace. Did you hear what The Best of San Giovanni said? He wants to make peace. - You answer him. - What peace? Go away! Learn that here there is no mercy for anyone! Put the knives here if you want to eat. - We forgot them home. - You will fast then. - What? - Totarello. Let’s respect the rule. Rigatoni with pajata, a big plate of that. - Of course. - Careful. Why did we come here? Weren’t we supposed to meet the butchers of San Giovanni? - Gnappetta did it. - What a hero! What hero? He went to present the declaration. What is the declaration? To fix an honor problem, one must act accordingly to the rules. - Someone will end up dead? - How can he end up if he is dead? Do you have guts? We have plenty of that. - Do you need some? - You need them. This is a declaration from Nino, The Best of Borgo. He will be waiting for you in an hour behind the Osteria. - Don’t be late. - What does he want? You will know when you get there. Now let’s drink to those who don’t have money. Cheers to us, because we have money. We are people of honor. We must play by the rules. To a knife you answer with another knife. To a rock you answer with another rock. I got wounded! Son of a bitch! Let me see, Alfredo. It’s nothing. - It hurts! - Stand up. Cowards! Come out if you have the courage. Here, we are like the three Horatii! We are as brave as the ancient Romans! Fuck you and the ancient Romans! Now we will beat you up! Brothers, come on! - Screw you! - Get this rock! - Here. May this hit you in the head. - Move. - Don’t push me! - Come out! - Don’t you hide! - Throw the big rocks. - The small ones go in the eyes. - All right. - Take this! - Go! - Here! - Let’s go, Bartolo. - Pietro! - Come on! - Let’s go! - Here, you dirty butcher! - Son of... - I got you! Come on, guys! Let’s not give them time to rest. Do you want to screw the sheep? Come on, brothers! - Let’s beat them up! - We will beat them good. - Here! - Guys, let’s go against them. Here, take this! Attack them! - Careful! - Take that! - Let’s hide. - Let’s go. - Did they find a factory of rocks? - Let’s try to get away. - Away! - This way. They are throwing so many rocks! - Nino, are they beating us up? - Yes, they are! Come on, guys! - Careful! - My ass! Let’s go. - Let’s go. - Bartolo! Here, take this! Velia! - Velia! - What’s wrong? - Totarello is home? - He went to work. - The horse is in the stable! - What are you saying? They went to get killed. What’s going on? - Do something! - Calm down, countess. Let’s resist! Pietro. Cover me. Cover me! Up with your hands! Cowards! Oh my God, the dogs! Run, don’t ever stop. This arch is narrow! Run. We are safe! I am glad I was a Bersagliere! Here, cat face! - What are you doing up there? - I am taking a walk. Here he is, The Best of Borgo. He goes to throw rocks like a little boy. He must be a man of honor, he is brave. While I am always worried because I care about you! Now you must wake up because I am getting tired. Should I take you to the hospital? Could it be that he is hurt for real? Give it to me. - How are you, honey? Are you better? - Are you crazy? So you will learn. You pretended to be knocked out so I'd take you home. I was fine. I could hear you moving the rocks... - Let go of me! - What a driver are you, if you don’t let me pay for the ride? Are you crazy? You kiss me in public! Do you want to dishonor me? Me? Dishonor you? Who told you this? Who told you all these things? Me, dishonor you? I want to go around with you! Let’s go, pretty brunette. - Pay me with the same coin. - What do you care about my kisses? Have that ugly woman give you kisses. I know everything! I don’t care about her. I just do it for the shop. - You are the only one I want to... - Make fun of! - Marry. How about the 29th of July? - Stop, Nino. Please, don’t make fun of me. Is it true? Did you say that we are getting married? - I said that we are getting married. - You won’t take back your word? What are you talking about? I’m Nino from Borgo! Every time I promised a girl to marry her, - I always married her. - But... It will be a nice party. Everybody will come to the wedding of his Majesty the King of Borgo. Why July 29th? Carnival is coming and no one can get married. Also because it will be warm and we will go to Venice for our honeymoon. When I did military service in Abruzzo, a gypsy read my hand. She said that July 29th will be the most important day of my life. - Also of who. - Who? King Umberto. Chinese, you are an ugly spy! I hope you die, you and your mothers! I would kill all children. Fuck you and the carnival! Giacomo doesn’t have a job, but he dresses always fine. He wouldn’t care to wash your floor, because his wife is a w... No, no, no. I don’t say it because I don’t know it! My cousin is always upset, she could throw you an object. On Sundays she doesn’t have a job, but she would gladly do you a hand... No, no, no. I don’t say it because I don’t know it! If someone is upset because I have a dirty mouth, could really ring my bell and don’t forget to go to... No, no, no. I don’t say it because I don’t know it! - Bravo, Nino! - Let’s do a French dance. - Here. - Careful. At each gong... How funny! I would like to dance with you. - Are you watching other women? - Rosa, I am comparing. You are the best of all. Are you making fun of me? I will tell The Best! That’s him? How scary! You are so beautiful, Rosa! - How can you be so beautiful? - I don’t know. - I would eat you. - I would say, "Enjoy your meal." Totarello, take your mask off. I feel like dancing with my brother! - All right. - Put it back on, it’s better. Changez la femme! Dance with someone else! Rosa, that in order to hug you, I had to disguise myself as my worst enemy. But I don’t repent that. Even if I die, I don’t care. We wouldn’t care either, but you would ruin our party. Guys, enough with the dance. What a shame! What if I don’t like that? - You don’t have to like it. - I said: What if. - Go away. - Let’s not water it down. - Let’s go to the ride. - Who arrives there first will win. - Are we going to the races? - Go with your mother. - I don’t like horses. - Augustarello. Are you hiding your face behind mine? What’s wrong? It’s carnival, I wanted to be a clown. You don’t have to dress up for that. You are always a clown. It was a good idea to go watch the races. Let’s go. See you. At every party, you did a game. Why not tonight also? Augustarello is right. Let's play the game! No, I prefer to go to the races. Have fun. Not playing the game, accordingly to our code of honor, is the worst insult. Not just for me, but for everybody. Forgive me, Rosa. I have to stay. Gnappetta, you go with her. Don’t worry, nothing will happen. I give you my word. Frascatano. Bring me some wine sour and generous like the heart of the woman who loves me. A game with a leader. I will not make mistakes and I will not cheat. I will have the glass full and you will be the fool. - Go, I am not going. - Why? We will have fun. - I prefer to go home. - Do what you want! Gnappetta, hurry! Let's play. For those who have the trust of the company, I am the most beautiful and I am a friend to everybody. Three, eight, eleven, thirteen. Seventeen, twenty one, twenty three. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, twenty, twenty one, twenty two, twenty three. I like you all but pay the wine upfront. For this round I declare leader... Verdicchio under Nino. The first drink is to thank all those who were good to us. Can I drink? Yes. This drink is for my friend Gigi. He is always so thirsty. - Can I drink? - No. I want that this drink is for Ciancicagnocchi. I obey. I’ll pass. Your pass is my passion. I want to offer this drink to Augustarello Di Lorenzo, the butcher who made us the surprise of this unexpected visit. Augustarello can get the glass. He can put it to his mouth. He can sniff it and smell it. Did you sniff it? Then he gives it to Totarello who is funnier than him. He is my brother in law and his head looks like a sheep. I’d let Augustarello drink. - Like the leader says. - Right. He always does what he wants and so I will drink your wine. I obey. We drank 25 liters. We drank too much. Nino. This little bit of wine would you give it to Augustarello? - Yes. - No! The fool must submit. If the leader disagrees... It is what it is. Augustarello, is not a dishonor to be the fool. - Good night, guys. - Good night. I am going to sleep. Let’s pee, the game is over. No! It isn’t over! It isn’t over! It isn’t over! It isn’t over! No... Nino! It’s nothing, don’t worry. Damn! Damn! Damn! When someone is unlucky I could have made some money. I know nothing, I saw nothing! No one told me anything. Carnival makes me nervous, I went to sleep. I didn’t know the accident would happen that night. All right, it happened. If you have nothing to say, you can go. You always treat me bad. Augustarello died, Nino is about to die. This shouldn't make you sad. Me? Why? Because... If Nino dies Rosa Turbine will be free. Listen, you piece of shit! You are paid to be a spy and not a procurer. Do you understand? You could pay all together. Let me tell you that in the house of Nino there are the Di Lorenzo’s brothers. What are they doing? Why no one is helping me? It hurts! It hurts... I feel like something is burning inside of me. It is a wound between the fourth and the fifth rib. It is not serious. I am a butcher, I know this. - He is a human, not at cow! - We are all the same. He lost lots of blood but the lungs are fine. - I will take care of it. - We will take care of it. Don’t worry. - How is he doing? - What do you think? The doctor said that maybe he will live and maybe not. If he will not survive, he will die! - What are you doing here? - We are here to help him. You are here to help him fall. You must believe me. What happened doesn’t matter. Nino and our brother were friends. I want to tell you something. In case you want revenge, let me warn you. - I am watching you. - And we are watching him. He could be saved but we need a good doctor. We will take care of all the expenses. Really? Pray a special prayer. Go to the Divino Amore sanctuary. Like our mother did when all four of us got meningitis. Nino always talked about our mother to Augustarello. I don't care... I want to arrive to the 29. That is the most important day. It’s incredible! They are always by his side. One is always there ready with a bicycle. He went to get medicines during the night. He has beaten up the guardian who didn’t wake up. They are curing him like if he was their brother. More than a brother! I am glad that it ended up like that. Yes, but it’s also the end of the men of honor. - I want to wash my hands. - Please, doctor. - Give me a towel for the doctor. - There are no clean towels. It doesn’t matter. Here is the meat, the best in Rome. Good. Make some broth and give it to him. A cup every two hours. - My coat. - A cup every two hours. - I understand. - What do you think? He has an exceptional body. - I think he will make it. - Good job. Money is not a problem. You have to cure him as soon as possible. It doesn’t matter the money, do what you have to do. Make sure he does not get tired. In case of need, send someone to call me. But it won’t be necessary. About my bill... It’s 80 lira. Ten. Twenty. Thirty. Fourth, fifty. - What day is it today? - The first day of summer. - It has been three months! - I am hungry. - Should I make you two eggs? - Yes. - Where is Rosa? - She went to thank the Virgin Mary. - Mom! Make two eggs for him. - Right away! He woke up. - Yes? - He said he is hungry. - What about Nino? - In this neighborhood nothing can be done if he doesn’t want to. No, please. I would like to talk here. Outside all eyes would be on us. - I say this for you. - All right, hurry up. - What do you have to tell me? - Well... I heard that finally Nino is getting better. - He is better, right? - If you know, why are you asking me? We asked everybody in the neighborhood trying to know more about the death of Augusto Di Lorenzo. It’s a serious matter, a wounded and a murder. Or at least a presumption of murder. The judge is trying to decide if he should arrest anyone. You can imagine who am I talking about. I tried to avoid that you'd be called to the police station. That’s why I am here. If you know something... No one talks here, so... There is only a spy here and you pay him too. Even if I knew something I wouldn’t tell you. Not even to save the life of my man. If my man knew something like that, he would spit on my face. I see. Thank you, Bartolo. If I am still alive I owe it to you. You know why we did it. We couldn’t let you die like that. I must kill you with my own hands. Of course, I would’ve done the same thing. - Whenever you want. - You have 10 days to gain your strength back. What about July 29th? No, I can’t. I have to do something much more important. Let’s do it before. What about the 23rd? At the dawn of the 23rd in the yard of the Renella. A knife 15 centimeters long. What do you need? Some fat beef meat or a chicken to roast? I must talk to you. Alfredo, serve her. Come on. The 29th, Nino and I are getting married. Tomorrow, the 23rd, we were supposed to do the papers. Nino told me it is not possible anymore. Why? I don’t know, I don’t have to marry you. - Augustarello wanted to marry you. - Tell me the truth. Do you have a duel with Nino tomorrow? It may be. So it’s true! You want to kill each other! Forget about this. I beg you, let go. - Did Nino send you? - No! He doesn’t know about this. He is a man of honor, like you. He is ready to die in order not to lose his respectability. But I don’t care. If you want, I will ask for your forgiveness. I don’t have this stupid pride. Let’s forget about this. I will forget it when I will see him buried. - Hi, Nino. - Hi, nice glasses! They told me you are getting married. Rosa is lucky, she will have you in her bed! Don’t worry, I'll always have a big fish for you. Stop it! Hi, Nino. How are you? We will drink tonight. You almost died! Only the good die young. Nino! Verdicchio. Everything is ready for tomorrow. I also told Totarello. Miss Rosa, I wanted to show you what I got. She never answers, that bitch. Bartolo told me everything. It’s for tomorrow morning, right? Answer me! - This thing doesn’t concern you. - It doesn’t concern me? Do you want to make a widow of me even before we get married? No, you are not going there. Try to understand. I can’t miss that. I would be dishonored. Really? Let me tell you something. Let’s bet our honor together. You stay with me today and tomorrow. In my house, in my room. My honor is worth as much as yours. You always said that you love me, give me this proof of love. I will take your word. From tonight until tomorrow morning, in your room, with you. All right. Let’s go. Are you taking it back? You must choose. Bartolo or me. I have chosen. But if you come to bed with me, I can’t marry you anymore. Don’t marry me, then. - Aren’t you getting naked? - Of course I am! I can keep my word too! I told you I will be with you until tomorrow and I will and without tricking you, maybe like a bad woman. I want just one thing. I asked the Virgin Mary to do me the grace. I want to save you from being stabbed. What are you doing, Rosa? What are you trying to do? Let’s forget this nonsense. I care for you, and you know it. Things went this way. Let’s not change our minds, let’s respect the deal. It’s not possible to live just for love. I have it written in my destiny. Engraved in my hand! There is something that is more important. For that you live, for that you die! A real man for his honor can even get is heart broken. Because life is not life if you have to live it without honor. Even if I love you so much, there's nothing I can do. I must go! I will be back! And I will never leave! With you I will be the king of the world! But if you will not see me come back, know that I did this for you too! Chinese! - What do you want? - Come down! - What? - Down! What does she want? - What? - It's important. Should we talk in the street? - Come in. - Yes. - Do you want some coffee? - No, no coffee. Nino went to a duel, we must stop him. What are you scared of? Nino is always the strongest. - Don’t worry. - He could ruin himself! And then I would be ruined too. Chinese, you must help me. I would like to help you, but how? Call the police. I know where they went. Yes. When you must tell something to the police, you go to the Chinese. Of course, I know this. I am dirty, a bloodsucker, a jackal, a spy. They all say that, but after they had their benefits. Miss Rosa, I help people only if I get something out of it. I will give you all that you want. Money? No, I don’t want money from you. You are so beautiful, Rosa! You could have all that you want from me. Everything. For just a little favor... Chinese, what do you want? A kiss. Just a kiss. No one cares for me. I will give you a kiss, like a sister. I don’t hate anyone, not even you. Rosa... If you want me to tell the police, you must kiss me where I want you to. Dirty! Filthy, dirty! They are coming. Go. There isn’t a knife 20 cm long. Nino is a fishmonger, he doesn’t use it. All right, pick it. This is for Nino. This is for Bartolo. - To the last drop of blood. - To the last drop of blood. - First I must tell you something. - There is nothing left to say. I know you are very good with the knife and you may even kill me. You are right, but hurry. My knife is thirsty with your blood. If you will kill me, don’t forget to listen to what Verdicchio will say. - It’s important. - Tell him to get ready to talk. You will be dead soon. Pigs! Pigs! Pigs! Pigs! When there are pigs around, the knives go away. - So? - We were joking. We were just training. For the Olympics! Do you think I am stupid? The experts established that your brother Augustarello died falling and being stabbed by his own knife. After stabbing Nino. Everybody knew this in our neighborhood. But no one talked for that usual thing of the honor. Thank God, Miss Rosa came to tell me everything. Calm down, telling me she didn’t tell the police. I left the police three days ago. I have decided that at this time, being a policeman and having some ideas it’s impossible. I will go back to my house. These knives? Come on! Let’s use them to cut some steaks when we will celebrate the peace between San Giovanni and Borgo with some good Roman food. Come on. Shake hands. Nino! Velia, Velia! Mrs. Teresa! Nino is back. He is back! - Nino... - Should we punish this filthy man? - Go away! - Get him! Where are you running away? Skunk! - Dirty creature! - Let go of me! Let go of me! Let go of me! - He peed himself! - Take him to the fountain. Wash this dirty person. Drink! More! The Chinese turned the water black! He is filthy! Another time! Enough of this. You have washed yourself and cleaned your guts as well. Now I can invite you to my wedding on the 29th of July. Remember, it’s an important date. - What are you doing? - We are ready, are you? They said yes, now the priest is talking. I hope it won’t take long or the pasta will over cook. Here comes the happy couple! What a beautiful couple! Are we taking the picture? Come on! Let’s take a picture, it will go down in history! Come on! Chinese, come take a picture with us. No, I prefer to stay here. Don’t move. Smile. One. Two. The sun is going down, all around us is getting dark, things are fading away. But inside our chest this feeling has overtaken us, this flame that is burning. I ask forgiveness from the pain, from the sighs and form the sorrows. My love, I care for you, but with that my heart full of pain I must give up and just caress you... because while you are sleeping I must leave. I will come back! And I will never leave again. With you I will be the king of the world. But if you... will not see me come back, know that... I did this for you too.
