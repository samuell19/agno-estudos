JEONGDOK PUBLIC LIBRARY l saw a girl here and followed her home When? l used to come here in high school. What happened? l got to her house and stood there Such a poor neighborhood Way up the hill near Miari. - Was she prem? - Yes, she was. l can still picture her walking ahead. She went into a tiny shanty l heard her father's voice inside l just came back aRer a while Without saying a thing? l got lost in the dark. You got lost? lt felt like a maze. l got scared. ''None but the brave deserve the fair.'' True - l was like that too. - You were? l ran offtoo l see Men need to be brave. l agree lt's so cold. Let's go somewhere lt's freezing.

Han Jungwon? He was in my film. l'm meeting him. Want to see him? Really? Where was he? l'm not sure. He won't say. He's finally back aRer so long. - He did business in Vietnam. - Vietnam? What did he do there? He doesn't look good. He gained weight - He gained weight? - Yeah, a lot - Then let's meet him. - Were you mo close? He was my first leading man. He's special. Such a shame. He's a good guy He is. This time they're being thorough. Civil defense drills stall evemhing. l bet Jungwon got stalled This is really great food! This is worth the money. lt's good, right? Worth evey cent Good to see you, Han. - Let's toast. - Okay. Hey Why do you call me Han, not my first name? Sory. l just got used to it. Of all things... - What do you do now? - l teach. - Where? - In Daegu That's good. How much do you make? - Not a lot. - How much? - It's a county school. - How much? - Seventy thousand? - Not even. Fim thousand, at least? Why do you want to know? Why are you tying to hide it? Still as pem as ever. l'm not pem. You're selfish. Ask anybody How am l selfish? You only think ofyourself. Come on, Let's enjoy dinner. That movie you did before You ditched me and cast someone else lt wasn't like that. Don't start this now. You cast that other guy because he was more popular. Didn't you? l never did that! Hey, Because you promised me that role l didn't work for a year. Then your producer gave me the news You should've called me, you coward! This is ridiculous l did call you! Only aRer you finished the movie! Really? No, he has it all wrong. Bullshit. l never get anything wrong There's no mistake about it Let's just drink - Cheers. - Cheers DAJEONG KOREAN RESTAURANT You don't have a girlfriend? - You're separated. - l don't. - No woman in your life? - Can't find one - No one you like? - l have someone.. Someone l care about just as a person l feel peaceful this way. Then why get separated? Your wife is a good woman. l forgot you met her She is.. l assumed you had someone. No. l just.. Couldn't sleep at home. Hard going home evey day - How long has it been? - A while. - That's understandable. - But he has someone Who? l thought you liked Boram. That's nonsense You misunderstood. She's just a friend You mo aren't involved? No - Who is she? - His friend from college She's a professor. Vey prem, too Really? - You're not sleeping with her? - No, she's just a friend. Don't go around saying that. lt's not good for her. - l won't. - You better not. l care about her. l insisted that we haye whiskey. We came to a bar called 'Novel' l ran into four people on the street today A film producer, a director, a music director, and a student of mine. They're all related to film lt all happened in menty minutes. Then what? lsn't that so strange? lt's just coincidence Nothing happened, but it's still strange - That is strange. - Right? Sure Nothing happened directly to me but it's still mysterious nonetheless Good point. It happened to me too. Ran into someone three times a day You did? l can't understand why it happened. But it's vey strange l want to know the reason. There is no reason Random things happen for no reason in our lives We choose a few and form a line ofthought. - A line ofthought? - Yes. Made by all these dots, which we call a reason. For example... Say l accidentally pushed this cup off. Why was my arm here right then? Why did l move that way? Countless coincidences operate behind this action. But we're only concerned with the result. We make my clumsiness the reason. l am the reason, but l'm really not. True. Too many coincidences are behind it. And more are behind those. That's right We can't help but make up judgments but many untraceable forces are at work in reality That's probably why our actions are fallible and sometimes lead to disaster l'm talking too much. Not at all. You put a lot ofthought into it. He's really grown! Really? Thanks, Jungwon l once thought that too. Really? l never heard it before It's so refreshing l really mean it. You're smart l'm sory l stepped out. You're back We found what we needed Something to eat, then? A snack would be nice - You've been out so long. - l'm sory This is Director Yoo. Jungwon is an actor - Nice to meet you. - You too l apologize again. - You should join us. - Yes, l might. We should drink. l hoped the owner would come out. Please come out. How many coincidences brought me out here? - l can think of a few. - What are they? The air, A man, A woman? You're ridiculous l'm acting like a fool Give me a cigarette. lt's fim cents Can't l have it for free? l'm joking. lt's yours Tastes good. - Good, isn't it? - Yes. - Jungwon seems amully quiet. - You think so? He's vey articulate Talks his way out of anything Really? - Better than you? - l'm no good You're vey articulate Better yet, you're smart. You've thought your life through. He's one ofthree big chatterboxes l know. He is? He's smart, but gets lost in his own words. Smart, but unlucky. l see Believes himselftoo much but not other things. Doesn't get along with others, but he's a good person l feel sory for him Yes, well... l guess you're right What kind of person am l? l don't read people that well. Tell me what you think. l'm intrigued. You seem like a nice person l do? l see You seem like a nice person Thank you The _rst snow is falling l'm so lonely. Wonder why l can't be with you. Should l accept iR From Kyun\code(01f5)jin. lt's snowing. Yes, it is. l don't know anything about reading people. But ifyou point out mo opposite extremes, they all believe it. This is what l tell a woman. ''You look vey outgoing and cheerFul on the outside,'' ''but you cary pain and sadness inside you.'' She replies, ''How did you know? ''That's exactly how l am!'' Mentioning both extremes is the key. We fall for it because of our opposing tendencies. Then what kind of person am l? Well... l'm not good at reading people, but... You seem vey practical and proper on the outside, but you're extremely emotional on the inside Does that sound right? That's how l am. This is creepy! That's really how l am. lt's so uncanny! - Are you really like that? - That's exactly how l am. - It's so uncanny. - l'm sure it is. - Excuse me l'd like to play the piano - Go ahead That would be lovely - But it's out oftune. - That's all right - But don't make fun. - No one's making fun. All right - Can l watch? - Sure. l had no idea you could play the piano You're playing with fire! Don't get drunk! l'm going to buy dumplings. Dumplings are great. - Are you going alone? - Yes. lt's late. l'll come with you. - Will you? - Yes, l'll come along - Thank you. - Let's go. Wait. Something wrong? - Isn't it cold? - Yes. Let's hury back - How long are you in town? - Three or four days. - Let's go back inside. - All right. We should get back Hang on What's your name? - l'm Song Yejeon. - Yejeon l see. l'm Yoo Seongjun. - Shall we go in now? - Of course. Hey! l should take Boram home! Okay! Bye. - Director Yoo. - You again - Drinking coffee outside? - l guess so. This is a close friend of mine. Hello. So you finally met him. Hello. We must be fate. - We should do one together. - You're right. Do what? l don't know why l keep running into you No need to make up reasons for it Just take in these marvels of life. This is marvelous? lt's just strange to me. l mean like the ''marvels of creation'' not ''marvelous'' - Like ''what a marvel''? - Right. What are you doing? Scouting locations with students. - With who? - They're over Where did they go? We've been looking for Iocations together. They're so prepared these days. Well, we should go. Let's go. No, this way. - Talk to you soon. - Okay. - Who was that? - Just some actress - l keep running into her. - l have someone like that. - She's quite lovely. - Is she? We'll meet her again. DAJEONG KOREAN RESTAURANT So you dated someone ''officially''? - You're that curious? - Yeah. l'm not She was exactly my ideal type ofwoman What's your ideal type? Someone who seems sharp and clever but is hopelessly good inside She's full of emotions She tries to hide it in, but she can't So it bursts out sometimes Someone you can sympathize for This is so strange l think l'm like that. l'm not kidding. That's how l really am. l think women are all similar. Eveyone has mo extremes. lfyou point out both extremes, they usually agree You know what l mean. No, l don't get it. But l really think l'm like that Well, eveyone can be similar and different, too - What are you saying? - He means... lt all depends on what you're looking at. - That's right. - What are you saying? Director Yoo. So you're not going to make films anymore? l don't have the strength for it these days - You can't keep up? - No. lt gives you will power and helps you think Strength is important. You look strong enough l'm the one who's worn-out Why? Are you tired? - l drank a lot these days. - Why? - l'm just hurting a bit. - What's wrong? l have some sorrow in my heart l see She was walking her dog and it got lost She looked eveywhere. How long did you raise it? She really loved that dog She put up missing posters and offered a big reward but she couldn't find it. His name is Rookie. l'm all that he has. He must miss home so much. He must want to come back to his warm house, and miss being held in my arms He... He... He has no one else but me He must be so sad and cold Boram. - Boram? - Yeah. Don't start cying again ls it that hard for you? No, l'm okay. No... l'll be fine - Thank you. - Silly girl Stop cying Stop! Come on But he must miss home so much. l had a dog too so l understand - Oh, you do? - Yes, a little. We went to a bar called 'NoveI' ror _oram She's an emotional woman unlike what she seems. This bar is so empty Even the owner isn't here. She'll be here soon. Do you know her well? - She's strange. - How so? Why is she out this long? lsn't she afraid of people stealing things? That makes sense. She's had a surprisingly hard life She's prem, but.. l don't think she's had a happy life. She shouldn't be out so long She sleeps here too? lf it gets late sometimes. There's a room inside. - There's a room? - Yeah. What's her stoy? Bad luck with men. The usual. But l can't talk about it It's her privacy l bet she's met a lot of men She did and she still does. But l'm not sure l think she's seeing a few Life gets boring alone. Long nights with nothing to do How many men? She dates a few The men aren't too serious about it. Mostly well-mannered older men. She's really prem, isn't she? Yes, she is. - More than me? - No. She can't compare Why not? You're completely different, because you're special to me - What's special about me? - You? Well... You're good. You're vey talented. You have many things others only dream of so just thank your parents Stop drinking and complaining for no reason l look like l have lots to be thankful for? You do You're bursting with talent! Just believe what l tell you! Don't suspect it! Stop doing that! l really mean it! Why are you yelling at me? l understood you But l'm lonely. l'm just so sad l really am l know l'm sory l'll do better l will. l'm sory for stepping out You shouldn't be gone for so long! l'm vey sory... Would you like something to eat? Yes, we're a bit hungy. - All right. - You know Director Yoo Hello. l apologize again Why does she wander around this late? Let's drink Yes, cheers. Boram was harsh on her. She must be upset. l'm going to the store to buy some food You are? l thought we had some leR... l apologize Walk safe I must be cursed. l cut loose all the men for you and now l'm pure. Don't push me away. Can't we saye goodbyes for later? From Kyun\code(01f5)jin. l'm sory l think l was too drunk.
