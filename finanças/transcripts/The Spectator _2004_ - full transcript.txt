LABRADORITE: FORTIFIES THE SPIRIT AND THE HEART Valeria? - Are you asleep? - Not yet. I fought with Marc again. He's not coming because he has too much work. He promised me! - Why are you laughing? - You argue about the same things. I know, but I'm right. If I don't graduate in October, my folks will send me back to Latina. - I have to rush to France when he wants. - Say that to him. - I did. You know what he said? "Out of sight, out of mind". It's a silly saying, but perhaps he's right. in any case, this very demanding project is going ahead. It is a success for raiI transports in wide consumption retaiI goods and large scale distribution where raiI can and must do more. Thank you for your kind attention. I told him straight out: "Dear Marc, I realize it's over. " "We have to evolve in life, but with you I'm going nowhere". He didn't say anything... Perhaps he felt a bit guilty. - Do you see him? - Who? He hasn't taken his eyes off me since we came in... I've had enough now. - What are you doing? - I'm staring at him down. This strategy always works. It'll be hard not hearing from Marc after three years. It'll be like giving up smoking. - I've always been a bit envious of you. - Why? You can live by yourself, without needing somebody by your side. Taxi? Taxi! Did you want me? Marc just called me, he's coming here to look for work. He's moving here, he wants to be with me forever. As I said earlier, the timing of this study is extremely delicate. This is the reason why it is important to carry on and support research in this sector that, as we can verify, has given and will continue to give cruciaI results. Thank you for your kind attention. We thank Dr. Becker for her speech and i introduce Massimo Alfieri, psychofarmacologist from the research bureaux at Arex industry. Good morning. As most of you already know, we are launching a new molecule on the market to treat depression. But i'd like to say something first. As you know, it is difficult to diagnose the difference between pathologicaI depression and sadness. This is why I'd like to mention something I feeI strongly about. With reference to sadness I wonder if our products, more than curing suffering, actually hide it... so that solitude, emotional poverty, detachment from the world will be apparently normal and serene. Only those who experience it are marked by the suffering. This is a complex ethical matter, which perhaps goes beyond my duties as a researcher and so i leave this up to you, to those who will choose to prescribe and use this treatment. Let us look at the characteristics and structure of Hdt8 molecules. - What's happening? - There are problems with the translation. - Are these the headphones? - Yes. i can't hear anything. - Sorry, it's my fault. - No problem, we start over again. - This has never happened to me. - It's alright. - i can speak slower. - No, the speed was fine. - So, can i start? - Yes. - Where shall I start off from? - Wherever you want. - I'll start with the molecule. - Alright. By analysing the molecule... we can see that it has a proteic connection of 30% with a slow distribution of tissue... Sorry... with a slow distribution of tissue which allows this match. Mum? "Dear Valeria, I have to leave right away. " "I'm sorry, stay as long as you want. Love, Mum. " - Valeria? - Yes? - Weren't you leaving on Tuesday? - I'm leaving a bit earlier. - How's your mother? - She's fine. She sends her love. I'll go to sleep, I'm dead tired. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. This building and this apartment were redecorated two years ago. The rent includes the laundry and the cleaning service. As you can see, the kitchen is fully-equipped. It belonged to Dr. Alfieri's dog, the previous tenant, then it died. He loved the dog more than he loved humans. Animals shouldn't be kept in apartments. - So Dr. Alfieri's moved to Rome? - Yes, for work. Suddenly. Where's your friend? She keeps you waiting, doesn't she? - What's wrong? Did you have a fight? - No. You make a nice couple. There's nothing wrong with it. I'd like to see how you two... At least I made you laugh! I can't understand whether you're sad or angry. Let me guess. Both. Sad because your boyfriend's dumped you... - Do you leave near here? - No. - Do you have a car? - Yes. - Let's go then. Marc should be here already. Hurry. - Platform twenty-two. - I'll wait for you at the bar. - Sure? - I want to have a coffee. - Five minutes, ok? Train from Bologna arriving at platform one. Train from Bologna arriving at platform one. The Eurostar train 402 for Rome is departing from platform three. The Eurostar train for Rome is departing from platform three. Hi, Sonia. It's Valeria... Are you there? Sorry for leaving like that without telling you first. - Where are you? - I'm in Rome. Yes, I know. It all happened so quickly, I'll explain later. I'm fine. It's a long story, I can't explain now... but it's something I have to do. I have to go, my card's run out. Alright. I'll call again. Bye. GRISSI FOUNDATION SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH INSTITUTE Didn't you see me? - Can you move your knee? - Yes, it's nothing. - I just lost my balance. - The hospitaI is close by. I don't even know your name. What's your name? - Valeria. - Flavia. Forgive me for not shaking hands, I wouldn't want another accident. - Leave me here, please. - Where are you going? It's already really late. I live just around the corner. I'II leave you my number... - Are you sure? - Yes, really. - Alright... - Goodbye, Valeria. - Goodbye. "Professor of CriminaI Law. 'La Sapienza' University, Rome. " To sum up, we can say that making a confession has always been a way of going against oneself. It happens in criminaI proceedings, but one thing must be clear: the confession must adhere to the rules of the criminaI proceedings. The confession we shall talk about today is soleIy the statement made against oneself. Is your knee better? I put some ointment on it and I slept well. I told you it was nothing. Why did the woman you quoted in the lesson confess? Because she felt guilty, I think. That secret was impossible to keep. What would you have done? If you commit such a crime, you have to go all the way. That's easy to say, but when you're stricken with remorse... I don't believe that people repent... not in this way. These situations intrigue me. I'd love to know what they say! What are you studying? I've never seen you before. - I've graduated. - What have you studied? - Foreign languages. I've just arrived here in Rome, I'm looking for a job. - Your accent is funny. Where are you from? - Trieste. I've lived abroad a lot. I've been living in To... in Milan. You've come from Milan to get a job in Rome? You'll change your mind. No... you're the kind of person who never regrets anything. - I had to come here. - Meaning? "If you've never lived in a family, you need to cut with your past. " Sorry... I didn't mean to be rude. - Hi, what would you like? - I'm here about the ad. - Are you looking for a waitress? - You need to speak to OwI. - OwI? He's over there. Thanks. Yes, but if the board of professors is still divided and... - Hi. - I'm listening... a friend's arrived. Sorry... Come in! Really? Come in... Yes, sure. It depends. We have spoken about it to the rector. We know about it already. We always have the same arguments, we stay there for hours... But there's no point... It becomes a vicious circle! Let's see how they react and we'll take action accordingly. Alright? You have a good evening too. Sorry, it's phone-call time. I should have called you, but I was passing by. I'm glad. I wanted to call you, but I don't have your phone number. I've got something for you. You might not believe in these things. - It's a beautifuI colour. Thanks. - You must carry it with you. They say it strengthens the spirit and the heart. I imagined a different house, it's so big. Do you live by yourself? Yes. That's what my partner and I decided. - What's his name? - Massimo. - So, how do you like Rome? - It's nice... Even though at times you feeI like an unwanted guest. - I had the same impression, too. - Aren't you from Rome? - No. I was the same age as you when I moved here. - Won't you take your coat off? - I'm going now. - Stay a minute. I'll make some tea. Sorry, I didn't mean to... She came looking for me, but I think she doesn't like me. She stares at me with those eyes... I wasn't very nice to her, I was in a bad mood. Now I feeI guilty. - Come off it! - Yes, I feeI a bit guilty. She gave me a gift today. Guess what it was. - The same stone you gave me. - The same one? - The same. Where are the two Gin Tonics for table four? They'll be ready in a minute. Thanks, but if you keep covering for me you'll get sacked too. If I loose my job because of you, I'll move in with you. - Get used to cardboard boxes, then. - Have you just moved? Tomorrow I'll be homeless. - Goodnight, then. - Goodnight. - Alright, aren't you coming up? - I don't like residentiaI hotels. - Ok. See you tomorrow. - Wait. "Miss Valeria called at 11:15. Call her back. " Hello... Hold on, I'll see if she's asleep. Valeria! It's for you. Yes? Flavia, it's you! It's alright. No problem. This afternoon? Yes, of course I'm free. Alright, that's fine. See you later. Bye! How come you're so happy? I get nervous, then I can't think straight. - How much for the room? - Who said anything about money? - My flatmate's paying. - What if he comes back? Not before the end of the month. If he comes, I'll kick him out. You see? It's easy. - I don't want to waste your time. - I don't have a deadline. Of course, I'd like to finish. For one reason or another, I always get lost along the way. - I'm a bit distracted, too. - You seem quite determined. You'll be a great help to me, not like the person before you. You wanted a job, right? Excuse me. Hello? Oh, Massimo! No... What? I can't now... I can't. I'll call you later. Me too. Bye. Massimo's recently moved to Rome, too. He's a pharmacologist. He was in a multinationaI company in Turin. - Didn't he like it? - He's doing something more interesting here. - Maybe he feels freer. - Maybe he wanted to be near you. I'm staying here. Happy? - Did you come by cab? - Yes. - Not again! He's stolen my lighter again! - Who? The research assistant, he's a go-getter. - You said the same about the Turin one. - He didn't steaI my lighters. - Have you had company? - Sort of. - Chewing gum. Must be young... - It's Valeria's. - What does she want? - She doesn't know anyone in Rome. - How about a movie? - Are you scared of staying alone with me? I'm petrified. I'm working on the book about Alberto. - I must absolutely finish it. - You've said that before. - It's different this time. - If you say so. Valeria's helping me. That's why she came over today. This book comes between us... It's just like... Like what? Nothing. "Little truth and many lies reported by the media", full stop. "Alberto became both a nationaI hero and a scapegoat", full stop. "His decision to abandon the triaI and resign from the committee of judges was finaI", full stop. - Am I going too fast? - Just a second... "finaI". "His was a courageous", comma, "politicaI", comma, "revolutionary act", full stop. No, wait! Take out "revolutionary". "His was a politicaI and courageous act. " It won't do. Let's take a break. I don't know much about it, but it can't be easy. I'm talking about my husband. - You hadn't told me. - He died 5 years ago, I never speak about him. I'm sorry. It's not here, I'II look next door. - It's here, Flavia. - Answer it, then. The black button at the top. Hello... Hello! i can't hear anything. Maybe the battery's run out. Hello, who's speaking? Oh, Valeria... Sorry, I thought I knew your voice. Don't worry, it happens. Yes, we're working. No, it's not a problem. She's here. I'II let you talk to her. Bye. Massimo? Don't worry, we were having a break. Tell me... Yes... I see... Yes? - Hi. - Hi. I'm reading a dissertation. Sit down. I'm glad we're spending the evening together. I'm very pleased with our work, I wanted you to know. It's strange, usually Massimo is on time... for the restaurant. We were supposed to discuss work... I thought it was us two. - I don't wish to interrupt. - I changed my mind. We need to relax, right? - Is something wrong? - No, everything's fine. I take care of it personally, I don't want my students... - I believe I've been invited to this table. - Good evening. - You can meet Valeria at last. - Nice to meet you. - Massimo. - Valeria. I went for a stroll. Sorry, maybe I'm a bit late. - Have you ordered? - No. - We can try their speciaI dish. - Yes, I recommend it. - What about the wine? I'd say... some Chianti. Well? How was today's big meeting? I don't know... Maybe they think I'm mad. I worked for a multinationaI company and earned twice as much. - They're wondering what this is all about. - They'll understand. It's not as simple as you think. - He's always been impatient! - Maybe. Thanks. Thanks. You live in Milan. I know it, even though I've never lived there. - Where do you leave? - Near the station. - The main one? - Yes. - How long are you staying in Rome? - I don't know yet. - Valeria's looking for a job. - You want to stay here? - Maybe. - Don't you miss Milan? - No. - You said that with no hesitation. - There's a good reason, then. - Yes. - Why Rome? - I don't know. Is that all you say? "Yes", "no", "I don't know"? Who knows, perhaps you're bored. You can say so, we'll handle it. - It's not a problem for us to drop you home. - Honestly, here is fine. - Thanks again for dinner. See you tomorrow. - Good night. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. - What's wrong with you tonight? - What? Maybe you wanted to be amusing, but you were just rude. - If she doesn't want to talk, she must have her reasons. - Yes. - It was a bit of an awkward situation. - Exactly. - At least she won't ask me about you. - Why? Did she? - Yes, often. - And what did you say? You'd love to know, wouldn't you? Hey! Hi. - Are you sad? - No. - What's wrong? Did that woman sack you at dinner? - Come on! - Did you close late today? - Yes, I'm exhausted. People just didn't want to go home tonight. May I? I'm doing useless things. I don't know what's come over me. Maybe I'm going mad, I don't know. I have to leave this place as soon as possible. Where will you go? I don't know... but far away. Andrea, don't... It'll be worse. - Did I offend you? - No. I care about you. Same here. - You're hurting me. - Sorry. The woman made an appointment four times and she didn't turn up or call to let me know! Alright, I'll do it. I can't now, I'm with a client. Bye. Sorry, a misunderstanding. So, what do you think? In this area the buildings are close, but you can put a veranda. They don't bother me. Oh, it's you! I thought you were the courier. - Did you run away from work? - A day off without feeling guilty. - Thanks. - Many happy returns. I'm older than you from now! - We can't go out right away. - It'll take an hour to get there. Don't tell it's my birthday, she'll feeI she has to get a gift. - Don't tell who? - Valeria. We work from 3:00 to 7:00 p. m. Dear Valeria, it wasn't the courier. - Good evening, Valeria. - Good evening. Massimo brought them for you. He wanted to apologize for the other night. Maybe I was a bit... Really, I was, but I didn't mean to... We'll forgive him this time. That must be the courier. Excuse me. Thank you but there was no need. Really... there was no need to... I was happy to do it. I understand you, because... I think I'm shy, too. Maybe I hide it better. I just pretend. But I don't like talking about my inner self, either. It all depends on who... With the right person it would be nice to open up, to tell her something about yourself... that you've never said before... not even to yourself. Has it ever happened to you? No. I knew it, they forgot the Ferrari article. - How long till you finish? - About a half hour. - Are we seeing Manuela and Claudio? - At 8:00 p. m. - We'll finish tomorrow. - Tell them we'll be late. - But you hate doing that. - I do! Perhaps they don't. I can go on by myself. I just have to type it and correct it. You're kind, thanks. - Are you upset I gave her the flowers? - No, not at all. - I only did it so she'd forgive you. - I know. - What did you talk about when you were alone? - Nothing. I asked her about your work. - What did she say? - She said it's coming along fine. Oh... She left the light on. WonderfuI! She's finished it. Shh! She's fallen asleep. Shall I wake her up? It's late, let her sleep here. Good morning. That's enough for today. - Have we finished already? - I have to pack. - Where are you going? - I'm going to Viterbo with Massimo. A friend is getting married. We're staying there a few days. Go on! Go on... Go on! Good morning. Good morning. The stock market's down. So now, that little savings I have will be even less! - A few days ago I went to see a house. - Really? It's close to yours. Top floor, redecorated, 180 square metres. - That's interesting. Isn't it big for you? - For me alone, it is. That's not what I had in mind. - You don't seem very enthusiastic. - I don't know... - I don't see why... - It's easier like this, you take no risks. I think it's fine like this. The good things we have are days like these, stolen from... From what? From the memory of your husband? Is that what you meant? I'm not surprised by your reaction, I was expecting it. I understand you, but you're only forty... Don't use that excuse. You know perfectly well that's not the problem. I'm really sorry, but I'm happy as I am. And I no longer know. Maybe I have no need for this sterile complicity. People change, you have to change. I'm ready to do it with you, but I'm sorry to see it's impossible. Because of you, most of all. Have you left the room? - Do you have to go back upstairs? - No, I was just asking. - Are the bags in the car? - Yes. I'll wait for you there. - Have you just got up? - Yes. Come in. I was passing by and I wanted to say hi. You never called. How are you? Not too bad. - I didn't think you were so messy. - It doesn't bother me. What matters is that your mind is in order. You are elegant, where are you going? I'm having lunch with my editor, he's here for the weekend. I'm free tonight. Do you want to come to a concert? I'd like to make the most of the weekend to finish some work. Not on Saturday night. I insist that you come. Can I make a call? I left my cell phone at home. Valeria, it's Flavia. Are you there? No, you're not there. I found those articles, so it's confirmed for Monday. See you at the usuaI time on Monday. Massimo and I were thinking of going to a concert tonight. Why don't you come, if you're not busy? The concert's at the Santa Cecilia auditorium at 9:00 p. m. Ok? Bye. - She's usually on time. - She must be on her way. - The concert's about to begin. - We're waiting for somebody. Maybe she didn't hear the message. Shall we go in? Shall we go in? You should get a driving licence. How do you manage without a car? I'm like a young lady, I'd rather be picked up. One day, I might get one... Decisions have to be made, right? Goodnight. Massimo! - Why don't you ask me to come upstairs? - You never wanted to. Yes, I know. "Alberto was Prof. Minutolo's, the politician's, favourite student. " "He was an annoying old man, but under that rugged shell, he was a kind man. " "Alberto and I turned out to go to his house one day", full stop. "It was an unforgettable day, going through books and memories. " "Alberto's eyes had a new sparkle", comma, "he even started joking. " He used to be a miser with me. Don't write, I was just telling you. One day, he waited for me outside my house, it was my birthday. Threatening, he said to me: "Gifts are poor. " "You will love me for my precious gift that's not there". Hello? Hi. I don't know. Let's do that. I'll call you back so I can look for them, ok? My assistant's hopeless, she's lost some files now. - But I didn't take them home. - I thought it was Massimo. He hasn't called today. He usually calls at lunchtime. - He's never been so methodicaI. - Not even yesterday or Tuesday. Can you help me? I'm looking for a blue file. You don't care about him, do you? Thanks. Hi, Valeria... - Hi. - I've been watching you. Didn't you see me? - Got a minute? - Yes. - Why are you sitting here? - I'm having a coffee. - Do you want something? - I'll have a coffee, too. Another coffee, please. - Why didn't you come up? - You always work from 3:00 to 7:00 p. m. - I didn't want to interrupt. - But it's almost 7:30 p. m. You worked overtime. So... how's the work going? Good, it's been a tough couple of days. - Your calls were missed. How come? - "How come" what? How come you didn't call? I had a lot of work. Thanks. I'm sure that this time Flavia will finish the book, thanks to your help, of course. I don't do anything, I just do my job. - I really don't think you're like that. - I am, believe me. - Are we on first names terms any more? - No... I have to go. Bye, Massimo. Wait, I'll come too. - You'll get the 40 or the 59? - The 40. - Does it take you home? - Almost, it's about ten minutes away. - Is it a nice area? - Yes. It's lively, full of pubs. - There are lots of students. - So I won't fit in! I'm looking for an apartment, but it's not easy. I'm starting to hate hotels. I used to live in Turin. I hated it but it was nice. I never understood why. Flavia and I broke up. I don't know why I didn't tell you before. Bye, Massimo. You can never get a cab here. I'll end up somewhere on this bus! Sometimes it's nice not to know where you're going. I'm sorry about you two, really. Maybe it's just a phase, you might start talking again. No, it had to happen sooner or later. It seems absurd, but deep down... we've always known that. I was in that bar earlier because I wanted to see you again. I wanted to do it for a few days but I didn't dare... Even today, when I saw you at the bus stop, I hoped you'd get on that bus. Then, you changed your mind and so I... Valeria! Valeria, stop. Pretend I didn't say anything. I don't know why I was waiting for you nor what I want. It's ridiculous, I know. You don't know me, but believe me... Don't look at me, please. Don't say anything else, please. I wouldn't know what to say to you. Coffee, please. - What time is it? - It's ten to three. - Your coffee. - Thanks. "Democritus believes that happiness is the measure of pleasure and the proportion of life. " Alberto liked this description. Proportion in terms of balance. - Hi, Flavia. - Hi. Come in. Just a minute. I wanted to get the grey suit I left here. Sure. It's in the wardrobe. I'll be right back. It's not there... - Aren't you working with Valeria? - No, she's gone. We finished. We finished the first draft today. Now what? I don't know... I'll wait before retouching it. I think it's good to leave things for a while. Sure. How's Valeria? She's fine. I think she's got a job. You've never been a good liar. I was going out. Shall we go? - Bye, then. - Bye. - Maybe we'll meet one of these days. - I'II... call you. "I could have told him. Flavia, I've chosen to tell you. " "You may not understand or forgive me, but there are some choices that you can't even explain to yourself. " "So you remain silent, because it takes courage to spoiI what people think of you. " "I don't even know what I think. " "When you read this letter, I'll be heading home to Turin, where Massimo lived, too. " "I followed him here, I tried to enter your lives and mine flowed away like water through my hands. " "When I'm scared of not being able to swim, I remain motionless on the surface, as if each moment stopped and each thought were interrupted. " "I just know that if I stay like this, I feeI no desire to sink, but, believe me, I feeI no desire to rise either. "
