[lion roaring] [bright orchestral music] [seagulls squawking] [metal scraping] [gentle musette music] [boat engine puttering] [gentle musette music continues] [men chattering] [sailor whistles] [bells clanging] You remember what I told you. Yeah. Whatever happens, you say nothing. I'll do all the talking. You understand? Mm-hm. -[bells clanging] -[men chattering] [Soldier] Come on, quicker, quicker. What are you waiting for? We come, we come. Your papers? Ah, they're here. In the other pocket. One moment. [Soldier] Quicker, quicker, quicker! [Salvatore] Now wait, be patient. I'll find them. Ah, ah-ah! Hey, what are you doing? -Now. -Quicker, quicker, quicker! Come on, quicker! Give this to Captain, as a gift. You think we Germans haven't enough to eat? -There are rumors, eh? -What? Hmm. Where's the rest of your crew? Ah. -Gaspare, Cecilio, Jethro! -Come on, come on, come on! Come back. You forgot to show the gentlemen your paper. Follow me. [bright music] They eat horses here? [gentle musette music] [children chattering] I saw it first! All right, all right, all right, we'll share it. Keep it then, you pig! [children chattering] [footsteps tapping] Ow! Ai, already? What are you doing here? But the children. You should have gone last night. Just a moment, Salvatore, you can't turn them out. Oh, she's my cousin. There's plenty of room where we live. Unless you prefer to go to the German Kommandantur? No thanks. I'm sorry. Come on, come on, come on. [sighs] Come, Lucia, we go, huh? As you see, it's not a palace, but at least you'll be safe. You know up here in the quarter the Germans do not come much, but never alone. An occasional raid. Ah, at night there is curfew. They are very brave then. You stay close to this room and there will be no danger. How long are we gonna be here? A week, a month? Who knows? A month! Maybe longer. When the time arrives I'll come for you. What are we supposed to do in the meantime? Do nothing. There must be something we can do. [Salvatore] Yes, Captain, there is. What? Try not to give trouble to those who help you. What I do, I don't do for my pleasure. In Marseilles, even under the Germans a fisherman can live well enough. I do it because I choose to do it. And I obey my orders. When the order arrives to come for you, I come for you. Until then- We're in your hands. I realize that. Sorry I blew my top. I understand. It's all right. Don't think we're not grateful. Can't ever repay you, but- You'll need it for food. Go to Dede. He has the Cafe Brasserie in the small square. The one we passed coming here? Yes, he will sell you what you want, for a price, but he won't betray you. Otherwise trust no one. You understand? No one. [Jim yawns] Would be better, I think, if your friend remains here in the room. With that face- And what's wrong with it? Nothing. It's so very English. [Jim] I should hope so. Well, goodbye and good luck. Bye-bye. The next time we meet, it will be to send you on your journey. Thanks for everything, Salvatore. [sighs] Picturesque, huh? Yeah, got plenty of atmosphere. Imagine bringing kids up in a dump like this. Well, it's not much better where I come from. Different for you, chum. [chuckles] I've known worst places, even if they did smell a lot better. Oh well, we'll soon clean it up. I saw some water somewhere. Have a heart, will you? Can't we get our heads down first? With the way that it is? Yeah, I can sleep on an anthill. [Dave] Help yourself. Beds, officers quarters. Other ranks, take the bunk. Jim? -[man humming] -[children chattering] -[door creaking] -[suspenseful music] -[shoe thuds] -[woman yelps] [dramatic music] Look, first you kick me, now you throw boots at me. [huffs] Sorry. Lemme have a look at that. [cries out] [dramatic music] -[woman laughs] -[playful music] [suspenseful music] [Jim yawns] I've been bitten. Yeah, well, so have I. Look. What did that? Bats? Dracula's daughter. -Huh? -You hungry? Yeah. I could eat a horse. You may have to. Think I'll go down and see what that Dede character's got to offer. [Jim] Uh-huh. Without ration cards, I am sorry, it's the best I can do. There's not very much here. There's a war, you understand? Yes, I've heard about it. You're Monsieur Emile? Mm-hm. My name is Schlip. I was told to ask for you. Ah. Sit down. Thank you. Can I get you something to drink? Dede, cognac! Cognac? Special reserve for our German guests. What, they come here? Oh, my dear friend, they come everywhere. I must get to Spain. I was told that you could help me. Not I personally. But you know someone. Yes, I know someone. Great man. Very brave man, who has helped many patriots to escape. Forgive me for asking you, but you are not French. No, I'm an Austrian. Enemy alien. I'm a Jew. My poor friend, we are both comrades in distress. I chose the wrong politics, you chose the wrong parents. Yes, yes, but your friend, he could help me? I do not know, I cannot promise you anything for certain. Ah, thank you. How much? 5,000? Probably will not believe me when I say that this is the first time I have accepted payment for this little service. -Indeed. -However, my needs are most pressing, thank you. And the address, you will give me the address? I will do better than that. I will take you there myself. Now? Ah, the stony bosom of my family awaits me. No, meet me here at four o'clock. Four o'clock, certainly. Thank you, thank you. [children chattering] Morning, Madame Netta. Good morning, Monsieur Blanchard. [children chattering] No? Aren't you going to ask me where it came from? I don't care where it came from. I'll tell you just the same. A Jewish refugee running for his life. He begged me to take him to the one man who could save him, the man you dare to distrust and jeer at, Dr. Martout. [Therese] Poor man. He thought he had to bribe me. So, I let him think so. I took his money. Was I right? I don't know. It's no affair of mine. What do you mean it's no affair of yours? You've taken it. Had it come from the Germans you'd have taken it! Go on, admit it. Wouldn't you? The child's hungry. Better she starved than that. [Therese] Where are you going? Out of your sight. [door slams] [children chattering] [doorknocker tapping] Yes? Dr. Martout? You're not a patient, are you? I'm not the medical doctor, you know. Monsieur Emile sent me. That's different. Come inside. Thank you. [children chattering] I'm sorry to keep you waiting, but I live alone. I was down in the cellar. Sit down, Monsieur... Schlip. S-C-H-L-I-P. You are not a Frenchman? No, unfortunately not. I have no home, no country. We live in a tragic period, Mr. Schlip. Yes, Monsieur Emile Blanchard told me of the fine work you are doing. You realize you are asking much. If you were a Frenchman, that would be one thing, but- But I must escape. [Dr. Martout] I know that. And naturally, I'll make it worth your while. I beg your pardon? [Mr. Schlip] I'm not a rich man, but- Are you presuming to offer me money? Well, I thought that- That the great work I am doing was available for a few francs? Monsieur, you do not understand me. No, no. We have nothing further to say to each other. You had better go. Wait, please, listen to me. I didn't want to offend you. If I only could explain how no one ever helped me from kindness. It's always been pay, pay. I've been cheated, exploited. How could I know that there were still people like you? Good people. If you abandon me now, I have nowhere to turn. Calm yourself. I will do what I can. You will? Thank you. Oh, nevermind. Sit down and answer my questions. Thank you. What is your full name? Heinrich Isadore Schlip. Your age? 59. Your occupation? I am, that is I was an undertaker, a mortician. How very curious. Family? My wife and two children are in England. I managed to get them out. [Dr. Martout] Any other relations? I don't know what's become of them. Of course. Have you any friends who know where you are in France? Yes, one. His name is Meyer. Lives in Nice. Mm-hmm. You must write to him and explain to him that he will not hear from you for the rest of the war. You understand that I have to take precautions. I will post the letter myself. Yes, I'll do everything you say. How much money have you? Now, about 8,000 English pounds. Of course, you know you cannot take that with you. But that's all I have. I have nothing in Spain. Currency can be traced. I cannot afford any risks. You must buy gold and jewels. Single stones are best. Yes, I understand. Come back tomorrow night, but do not come to the front door, and see that you are not followed. Come to the side door in the alley at quarter to 10 exactly and I will be waiting for you. You are going to get me away during the curfew? Now, you cannot expect me to disclose all my secrets. I promise you one thing, by the time the curfew has ended, all your troubles will be over. More than that I cannot say.

[Soldier] Not a sign of anyone. -Und? -No. They must be here somewhere. [man chattering] [Woman] Just go back to Parfait Hotel. [Soldier] No, they're not down here. They're up here, man. [Soldier 2] We're wasting our time. We could search all night. Just look at Herr Umschlag. [laughs] Cheer up, Umschlag. What you need is a drink. What you need is a drink.

It's young Eric's birthday. [group cheers] He is 20 years old. [Umschlag laughs] 20 years old and never been kissed before. [group laughs] [gentle music] What do you want? Shh! I came to say thank you. It was brave of you to hit that German. It was my pleasure. Yes, but you did it for me and I'm grateful. Very, very grateful. [gentle music continues] [bells ringing] Jim, come on. Wake up, come on. What's the matter? I'm gonna rustle up some breakfast. Hold the fort, will ya? Oh yeah. Hell's bells! Had 500 francs in that pocket! What's that, chum? Lucky she didn't find the rest, what's left of it. She who? [Dave] Girl who was here last night? Girl? There wasn't any girl, you must've dreamt it. It's all here, anyway. Hey, was a girl here last night? Yes. Well, who was she? Girl who bit me. That Dracula's daughter? Her name's Lise. Well, what'd she come here for? Oh, I see. You know how it is. Can't say I do. Comes with being happily married, I suppose. Anyway, you don't have to hide the weekly pay packet. What, didn't you ever cheat on Evie? Me? Ooh, I wouldn't dare. Good for you. Once the war is over and Sue and I get married, it's gonna be the same. Yeah, on whose side? On both, of course. [Jim chuckles] I get your point. Look, it's none of my business, but if you wanna fool around- Jim, do me a favor, will you? Forget the whole thing. It's over, finished, done with. You mean that? Of course I mean it. She fenced 500 francs off me. What are you going to do if you run into her again? [chuckles] Shake her till her teeth rattle. Oh, ha ha. Ha ha ha. [door clicks] Good morning. Hello. [clears throat] You were saying, Dave? This is Jim. Lise. I bought you a razor. Where's my 500 francs? Oh, they're all gone. I spent them. What do you mean you spent them? We must eat. I bought coffee, not real coffee, but one can drink it. Coffee, bread, sausage, cheese, tomato, tomato, egg. Hey, did you say eggs? As in hens? Oh, they are very expensive. There is only one. [chuckles] It's for you. Oh, Monsieur Jim, there is a bottle of wine. Oh, I don't drink wine, thank you. You don't drink wine? [Jim] No. Milk? Thank you. And look, a piece of soap! It cost a lot of money, but it will last a long time. Not bad, not bad for 500 francs. Oh, some of it I stole. The milk's warm. Of course, Rosanna was milked an hour ago. Who's Rosanna? A goat? Hey, if this is goat's milk, you won't catch me drinking any of it. Rosanna is a cow. She's not a very young cow, but the milk is good. She belongs to Ciro Piro. He lives up there. Well, where does Rosanna live? Up there, too, of course. In the same apartment? Where else? She's the only cow in the whole quarter. She's very valuable. [Dave chuckles] You don't believe me? Very well, when you have eaten, I shall take you to the roof and you shall see. Yes, but you'd better shave. [men chuckling] [bright dramatic orchestral music] [Rosanna mooing] There. Now you believe me? Poor old girl, she must be very lonely. [chuckles] It's bad to be lonely. When Carl went away, I cried all night. Who's Carl? A German soldier. They sent him to the Russian Front. Now they're all old men or young boys. I'm glad you came. Well, thank you. Look, it's no business of mine, but don't your people mind you fraternizing with the Germans? My people? Your father and mother. [Lise giggles] What's so funny? My father ran off before I was born. He did not even stop to say hello to me. And your mother? I did not like her very much. She used to work at The Pelican till the Germans came. Then she got sent away. I don't know where. Perhaps she's dead by now. You mean, there's nobody looking after you? Yes, there is you now. And after me somebody else, I suppose. Not if you take me back with you to England. [Jim laughs] Why do you laugh? Just the thought of you in Salisbury. What is it, Salisbury? Is it a place. That's the town where I'm living. Is it a big town like Marseilles? No. It's about as different as it could be. Very old and very beautiful, very respectable. There's a famous cathedral there. Well, it is the same with cathedral here. Look, Notre-Dame de la Garde. That's very nice. But the resemblance ends there. I don't think Salisbury's the place for you. Why? You'd be like a fish out of water. Why? You know, for one thing, you say whatever comes into your mind, ya know? But there must be other towns. I think I would like very much to go to England. Well, if it comes to that, so would I. -[water splattering] -[children chattering] ♪ I do like to be by the seaside ♪ ♪ I do like to be beside the sea ♪ ♪ I do like to stroll upon the old prom prom ♪ ♪ When the brass band plays diddly um pum pum ♪ ♪ Ah dee do da dee You English?

We were in camps in Italy, different ones, of course. I got wounded making my break and the Eyetie resistance picked me up. They'd had Dave about a month. After a while they shipped us down the line together. That's all. Fancy that. Quite a hero, aren't you? What part you come from? Me? London. I'm a Londoner myself, born and built in Battersea, know it? -I'll say I do. -Nice part. Oxford has changed a bit, though since my day. Ooh, I haven't been back for nigh on 20 years, not since I got married. Your husband French? Well, sort of. He's stevedore down at the docks. Come on in, I'll make ya a cup of tea. -Dave? -Uh-huh. Will you buy me a pair of shoes? Haven't you got any? Oh yes, but they're very old. In the shop there is a beautiful pair with heels like that. -Uh-huh. -Like that. They're only 3,000 francs. I haven't gotten any money. But you must have. All Englishmen are very rich. [chuckles] Don't you believe it. Oh, it's well-known. Oh, well this one isn't. All Jim and I have got between us is what we raised from selling our wristwatches. We wanna eat sometimes. You did not sell your ring? It happens to have been given to me. -By a girl? -[Dave grunts] By an English girl? By the girl I'm going to marry. Does that satisfy you? It's a very ugly ring. If you sell it- If I do have to sell it, it won't be to buy you shoes! You're a bad man and very mean. You kick me, you throw things at me, you make love to me, -and now- -Just a moment. I make love to you? -[hand smacks] -Ow! Oh, I think I hate you! [Dave] Lise, Lise, come back here. She went that a-way. I know, let her go. Come on, come and have a cup of char. Come in, my dear friend. Thank you. Right to the minute, I see. Must be your professional experience. The body must be delivered promptly to the place of burial, huh? Is everything arranged? Everything. In half an hour you'll be on your journey. I can hardly believe it. -Sit down, sit down. -Thank you, thank you. Tell me your plans. Plans. Or that is you hope to get from Spain to England, then to a blissful reunion with Madame Schlip? And my sons. They're fine boys, Doctor, fine boys. You're not joining me? I never drink when I have work to do. Well, perhaps it would be better -if I- -No, I insist. To your good health, huh? I don't know how to thank you for what you are doing. Virtue has its own rewards. You have brought the letter to your friend in Nice? Oh yes, yes, right here. You can read it if you wish. Thank you. "I am safe and well. Don't expect to hear from me again till the end of the war. Therefore, make no inquiries as to my whereabouts. I am in safe hands." Eminently satisfactory. [Heinrich] You've got some very interesting things here, Doctor. I pride myself on being something of a collector. Forgive my curiosity, you did say you are not a medical doctor. What exactly is your profession? My profession? Murder. No, seriously. Believe me, I am entirely serious. It may interest you to know that I'm probably the greatest murderer of all time. That's very amusing. You find it so? Mind you, I must confess that my career has only been made possible by the mistakes of others. I think you must be mad. A very profitable form of lunacy, surely. 8,000 Pounds of gold and jewels. You have them with you, I trust. For one night's work? No, Monsieur Schlip. Only a genius could devise so simple a system where my victims seek me out and become my willing accomplices. You, by the way, are the 96th. And all those people, those unhappy desperate people like me who come to you for help, you have- Murdered them, yes. -Without pity? -Entirely. It is a childish emotion and I'm a practical man. And if the war goes on for another year, I shall be a very rich one. Why are you telling me this? That is a thing I reserve for those who have offended me in some way or other, like you, for example. You ridiculous little man, offering me money. How could you know how much you pay me? What will you do with me? That brandy contains a harmless, but powerful sedative. Already your speech is becoming slurred. Soon you will be unconscious, or as near as. Makes no matter. Then, down to the cellar. Quick lime. Crude but efficient. Don't worry, you won't feel anything. Your soul, if you have one, will be in hell or in heaven, or in England with Madame Schlip, who knows? You devil. I won't let you. Already you're having difficulty in rising. Only to be expected. I'll shout. I'll shout, I'll call for help. And bring the German patrols running? Would that be wise, my dear friend? Dachau, Belsen, Auschwitz, the gas chambers? Compared to that I'm doing you a favor. In your own interest, may I recommend another little glass? [breath puffing] [Dave] It's gold, all right. [grunts] 5,000 francs is the best I can do. Very well. I am sorry, you understand, but I've got to live. [shoppers chattering] [dramatic music] That girl, thief! Stop her! [whistle blowing] Stop her! -[whistle blowing] -Stop, thief! [dramatic music continues] -[group shouting] -Stop, thief! [suspenseful music] -Stop, thief! -[group shouting] [children chattering] -[gentle music] -[shoes tapping] Hello! Hello. I thought I'd seen the last of you. Oh, I was angry because you would not buy me the shoes, but now I have them, look. So, I'm not angry anymore. Yeah, well somebody is. Who? The man who was chasing you? Oh, him. You saw? Yes, I saw. [soft bright music] You walk very fast. You don't have to follow me. You are in a big hurry? Yes, I wanna get back. Wait! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. It's quicker this way. Well, you should know. [soft bright music continues] [children chattering] Wanna sit down? Yes, very much. [gentle music] Serves ya right. What have you done with your ring? I needed the money, to buy food. Is that why you're so bad-humored? I suppose so. Oh, do not be angry. There are plenty of things. I will steal one for you. Aw, no ya don't. Yes, a big one with a diamond on it. Look, I don't want a diamond ring. Then you can tell everyone your girl gave it to you, and they will say she must be a good girl and love you very much to give you not only just an ordinarily dull ugly ring, but a fine big one with a diamond on it. You're crazy. Because I love you? Ah, you don't love anyone. You're just a little animal. Animals love people. Psst! [children chattering] There you are, you don't even love children. Sometimes I love them, but not now when I'm making love to you. Don't take things too seriously. I'll be leaving any day now, at least I hope so. Leaving? [Dave] Well, I can't sit the war out in Marseilles. Why not? [Dave] I happen to be a soldier. But there are a great many soldiers. Could they not win the war without you? Well, I dare say they'd make out, but that's not the point. I've just got to get back. To see the English girl? Well, that, too. It's been a long time, ya know. It's almost three years. [Lise] In three years she will have forgotten you. [Dave] She's not the type. She's not that little anymore like me. Is that what you mean? [Dave] More or less. I see. If she did not exist, if you had never met her, do you think perhaps you would love me? [Dave] Maybe. The Germans say they have dropped many bombs on England. Perhaps they have dropped one on her. Oh, do not be angry. I'm sorry, truly I'm sorry. I didn't mean that. Look, I bite my tongue. I hope that hurt. Very much. You forgive me now? I suppose so. It's not my fault that I'm jealous. Oh, Dave, why do they say that it makes you happy to fall in love? [engine rumbling] [heels click] Trautman, Colonel. Personal staff, Reichsfuhrer Himmel. My credentials. I make no apology for disturbing you, Colonel. I come direct from the Fuhrer's headquarters. You're welcome, Colonel. You may leave us, gentlemen. No, let them stay. What I have to say concerns all of you. The Fuhrer is gravely concerned about the situation which appears to have developed in this sector. Reports have reached him of a succession of incidents involving members of the German armed forces. Escaped enemy prisoners, murders, kidnappings, unexplained disappearances. This situation can no longer be tolerated. Have you ever seen the Old Quarter, Colonel? No. Why? Tell him, Grautner. -[heels click] -Allow me. This is what is called the Old Quarter. Acres of filthy hovels crowded together, crawling with the worst criminals in Europe. Safe for a man to show themselves alone there even in the daytime, and below ground it's like a rabbit warren with each house leading to the next one. It's a stinking sewer, sir, there's no other word for it. To police the whole place sufficiently would take an army corps. We've done our best to clean it up, but- With conspicuous lack of success. Well, so far, yes. Then, gentlemen, you will be pleased to hear that the Fuhrer has graciously accorded you exactly 14 days in which to repair your failure. 14 days? If after that time, there should be a single further incident, you will be held personally responsible. It's preposterous. Preposterous, Colonel? What can we do in 14 days? You're authorized to take whatever measures, however severe the situation demands. You don't understand. I could shoot a thousand hostages, it would make no difference. It's not just men we're up against, it's bricks and mortar. As Grautner says, the place is a rabbit warren. Destroy the warren and you can pick up the rabbits at leisure. Of course, that's it. We could throw a cordon round the entire quarter and blow the place sky high, house by house and stone by stone. -Magnificent, Colonel. -Unthinkable! Do you know how many people live in the quarter? Not only terrorists and refugees and criminals, but wretched creatures whose only crime is poverty. Are you seriously suggesting that I should destroy the homes of more than 20,000 men, women, and children? Your humanitarian sentiments do you credit, Colonel. You have heard the Fuhrer's orders. How you carry them out is your affair. But let me give you a word of advice. If you do not succeed within 14 days, all you gentlemen had better lay in some warm clothing. I understand that it's extremely cold at this time of the year on the Russian Front. Heil Hitler. [heels clicking] [children chattering] Renee, Renee, Renee, Renee! Arthur, wait for me! May I go play? No, you may not. -Why not, Mama? -No! Oh, let her go. The child has a fever. No, it's nothing. Besides, she'll feel much better in the fresh air than locked up in this apartment. Go on, run along and play. Thank you, Papa! That's right, defy me. If she catches her death, that'll be your fault. Instead of going out, she ought to have a doctor. She ought to have a lot of things. And I suppose you're going, too. You look disgusting. Why don't you shave once in a while? -Why don't you? -Beast. Mm, that smells good. What is it? Baby octopus. [Dave groans] Why did ya have to tell me? But they're very good! And you enjoyed dinner the other day. [laughs] Until I knew it was snails. [Lise laughs] Hey, Dave! Oh, hello. Hello. Where have you been? Upstairs having a natter with Mrs. Abou. What's she got you all head up about? It can wait. No, come on, come on, come on, let's have it. She knows a chap she thinks can get us out of here. What about Salvatore? Well, what about him? He hasn't been near us since he brought us here 10 days ago. Supposing the Jerrys have picked him up or something? Well, he'd have got a message to us somehow. Well, he'd have got a Who is this chum of Mrs. Abou's? Emile something or other. I've got his name on a piece of paper somewhere. Emile Blanchard. [Jim] Yeah, that's it. [Dave] You know him? He's a refugee from Paris, I think. He has a little daughter. They are very poor. Isn't that that seedy-looking guy that was always hanging around at Dede's? [Lise] Uh-huh. [chuckles] No thanks, we'll wait for Salvatore. The longer the better, huh? You got something on your mind, Jim? Oh no, nothing, just that I've had Marseilles. I've got a wife and kids. The trouble with you is you don't wanna go. You're having too good a time. You want a sock on the jaw? Yeah? Why don't you try it! You're ugly enough as it is, ya big ape. I'm sorry. Forget it. I could be wrong about the fella. We keep him in reserve, okay? [Jim] Yeah, okay. Are you going to fight now, or are you ready to eat? We'll eat. Lise has made us something special. She has? Well, what is it? No, no, no, don't tell me, let me guess. Mm, how did you know my favorite dish? This is smashing! One thing I fancy is a nice plate of tripe and onions. [Paul] You are Monsieur Emile Blanchard? And you are Monsieur Paul Bourdin. Oh, you recognize me, huh? Penalty of fame, my dear Minister. I resigned my portfolio two days ago. Really? I thought the newspapers said you were relieved of it. We don't need to go into that now. What I want to discuss with you now is- Foreign travel? Exactly. While I could exercise some moderation in the councils of government, it was my duty to stay in Vichy. Now, I feel I can be of greater service elsewhere. Ah-ha. In other words, having feathered your nest at the expense of your defeated countrymen, you now want to get out while the going is good. You're very insolent. It is the one luxury I can still afford. Are you sure you really can afford it? Perhaps you are right. I could, for a consideration of course, put you in touch with someone who could do what you want. However, it is only fair to warn you, that while my patriotism may be for sale, his is not. I don't think he would touch you with the end of a 10-foot pole. Just give me his name and address. I know how to handle him. Well? After you, my dear ex-Minister. [engines rumbling] Your papers. [engines rumbling] Visitors. Again? You'd better hurry. Are you the proprietor? [Dede] Yes. This establishment is requisitioned by the military authorities and will be closed to the public until further notice. Search the premises. Gautner. [snaps] [footsteps thudding] [doorknocker pounding] Good morning, monsieur. Are you the house holder? This is my little villa. Any other occupants? Nobody else lives here. Your papers. Your name? Martout. Uh-huh. All right, I have orders to search the house. There must be some mistake. There's no mistake. We're searching the whole quarter. That is quite different. Please come in. Where would you like to start? Well, we'll start with the cellar. By all means. I'm afraid it is very damp. Before you go down, would you allow me to offer you a small glass of cognac? Well, monsieur, that's very nice of you. -Very nice indeed. -Not at all. On the contrary. Come in now. [Soldier] When have I refused to drink good French cognac? [doorknocker pounding] Girls! Customers. [upbeat music] Come in, boys. Make yourselves at home. The young ladies will be here any minute. Assan, get the gentlemen a drink. [girls chattering] Well, look who's here. Stop that damn noise. [Madame Parfait] Assan. Sorry, madame. We're here on business, -ours not yours. -[switch clicks] What can I do for you? Looking for undesirables. How many men have you here? Men? Only Assan and he's done nothing, Besides, undesirables indeed. This is a properly conducted establishment. As that young man can tell you. He's an old friend, aren't you, dear? Yes, I see. Well, Corporal, since you know the place so well, you better go and search it. Go on! -Hello. -[women giggling] Stop that, you- Oh, naughty language. Let's all help him to look, huh? [women laughing] Corporal! You better take Private Holz with you, -for protection, eh? [laughs] -[women laughing] [fist pounding] Where do you think you're going? I live here. All right, you can go in. Thanks for nothin'. [fist pounding] Oh, I'm all out of breath. What's up? Jerrys, they're right on the stairs. Be here in a minute. Where's your friend? I don't know, up on the roof, I think. They mightn't look up there, they didn't last time. What about you? They'll wanna see your papers. I've got forged ones. Look, here. Who's Michel DuPont? Well, that's me, photo and all. Oh, well I never. They're good as real. Oh, you'll be all right. Yeah, as long as they don't start asking me questions. I hadn't thought of that. I know, quick get into that bed. What for? Don't argue, do as I say. Get in. Ya don't think I'm doin' this for fun, do ya? Me at my age. Right in. [fist pounding] Oh! Shh! My husband's asleep. Then wake him up! Oh, let him sleep. He's been on night shift. I've got his papers here. [Umschlag grunts] [metal clanks] Then who is that? That? That's my brother-in-law and his family. They're twins. He's a lot younger than you are. Ah, well, just a year or two. All right, keep your distance. Not going already, are you? Don't you French ever think of anything else? Oh! He's gone, you can get up now. Oh, if you could see your face. [laughs] What a wicked old woman I am. [laughs] [Lise sniffles] [soft somber music] What's the matter? I was thinking soon you will be leaving me. I've got to, you know that. You will go back to that girl, to England. And then I shall be alone again. Oh, not for long you won't. You'll meet someone and fall in love and get married, have swarms of babies, you'll see. No. Dave, you won't forget me? Tell me you won't forget me. Of course I won't. And you will come back one day? One day. If you don't, I will come and find you. You do that. [residents chattering] [Woman] Au revoir. All right, we split up now. Corporal, you and Holz take that side. [Woman] You come back, huh? -Au revoir! -[women laughing] Come away, Rosanna, come away. Don't let them see you. [child giggling] Well, get out of my way! [boy spits] -[Rosanna mooing] -Shh! My beauty, or they are going to take you away from me. Out of my way! [Children] One, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, one two, one, two. [fist pounding] Shh, be silent, my darling. [Rosanna mooing] [children giggling] Who did that? I shan't warn you again! [Rosanna mooing] What was that? -It's a cow! -No, monsieur. -There is no cow here. -[children mooing] It is a chicken. It can't have been... -It's a cow, moo! -[children shouting] -It's a cow! -[children shouting] Stop it! Stop laughing! [Children] Moo, moo! I'll teach you to laugh at a German soldier! -[gun firing] -[dramatic music] [children screaming] [soft suspenseful music] [dramatic music] [Officer] Stupid fool. No, I didn't mean to kill her. It was an accident. I fired over their heads. I didn't mean to kill her! Control yourself! [hand smacking] [somber music] [soldier crying] Come, get out of here, quickly. [somber music continues] Can you see anything? It looks like a raid. Yes, perhaps they will not come up here. But we can't leave Jim. No wait, Dave. If the Germans are in the house, it may be too late. You can do nothing. Let me go. If he's still in the room, I'll bring him. -Well hurry up. -Yes. [footsteps tapping] What happened? A German soldier, he's coming up here. You must hide, quick. Come on. No, no, he saw me. Leave him to me. He'll think I'm alone. I will get rid of him. Fritz, have you finished your side? [Fritz] Yes. Want me? No, there's nothing here. Go and find out about the shooting. I'll join you later on. [Fritz] Very well! -[soft ominous music] -[switchblade knife clicks] No, please, Dave. All right. [soft suspenseful music] Well, well, so it's you. All alone up here? [soft suspenseful music continues] Changed your mind about being nice to me? -[dramatic music] -[Lise cries out] [dramatic music continues] [knife thudding] [Lise] Oh! [dramatic music continues] [Dave grunts] [suspenseful music] [Umschlag screams] We better get out of here. Your poor arm. It's all right. Wait, wait, was he alone? I did not see anybody else. Come on. [footsteps tapping] Quick, he's coming back. [Jim snoring] Oh! [Jim] No, no dirty cracks. Oh, you didn't have to give me a turn. I thought it was that nasty fat German come back. You been fighting? Yes, on the roof with that nasty fat German. Is he dead? He's dead, all right. That's a mercy. He's at the bottom of the well between the houses. What'll happen when they find him? They will search the whole building. Bound to turn the whole place inside out. Ya can't go out, though. The whole street's full of soldiers. They don't need to. There is a way to the next house, upstairs through your apartment. Through my apartment? Well, that's the first I've heard of it. Who said so? My mother told me, oh, long ago. It's through the bedroom. Through my bedroom? Well, the very idea of people popping in and out as if I wouldn't know. Are you sure about this? Yes, you must believe. It's a hidden way until we find it. Come. Oh, no you don't, miss. I'll go first, if you don't mind. All right, then where is it? Somewhere in that wall. [fists tapping] Well, it seems solid enough. Maybe it's been filled in. Perhaps in the wardrobe. Here, I'll do that. Gimme that. -Mr. Abou's Sunday best. -[fist tapping] Do ya hear that? [Jim] Well, that's it! Ah, I told you! [plaster cracking] -[bodies thudding] -[wall cracking] Well, I never. Oh! Ooh, isn't it dark in here? [Jim] Don't worry, Mrs. Abou, we'll take care of you. [metal clanking] I've got a match here somewhere. Ah, who's that! [metal clanking] What a funny room. I've never seen anything like it, Dave, have you? No. Who are you and what are you doing in my house? Your house? [Both] Yes. If I'd known what I was living nextdoor to all these years, I should never have slept a wink. [man clears throat] Then you, you must be the undesirable they're looking for. German visitors, I suppose. -Assan- -Here, just a minute. They're not Germans, not by a long choke. They're British! Oh, I see. Perhaps that explain why you didn't use the front door. -Okay. -[women giggling] Ah, come on, come on, run away, girls, run away. Wait here. You, too. -Who, me? -Yes. Tell the old woman to go back where she came from. Well, I like that. Who's calling who? Oh, all right, I'll go. You better come, too, young lady. It's no place for you. No! Now, young men, you're Allied soldiers, huh? Escaped prisoners of war. And I take it you're really in trouble? [Jim] Well, that's putting it mildly. Just a little case of a dead German. Then you really are in trouble. A dead German? Where? In the little courtyard at the back. My courtyard? How did he get there? He fell. He fell, yeah. Did anyone see him fall? Not that I know of. Come. -Assan. -Yes, madame. In the courtyard you will find a dead body. [Assan] A dead body, yes, madame. [Madame Parfait] Bring it into the house and hide him in the washroom. Tonight you will find some way to dispose of it, all right? Tonight I will find some way to dispose of it. Very good, madame. They will miss him, of course, but they have had so many deserters. Meanwhile, you will be safe here. I don't know how to thank you, madame. Nor do I. [residents chattering] Reports from all sectors now complete, sir. Well? 17 suspects have been arrested. Nine Frenchmen, three Pols, one Spaniard, four Germans, sir. Anything else? Go on. Five of our men are missing, sir. What? Undoubtedly they've been kidnapped by the local population, sir. Or stabbed in the back. Undoubtedly. This filthy, stinking hole. All right! They're going to pay for this. Shall I call in the troops, sir? Yes! Seitz! [Seitz] Yes, sir. Call off the raid. [Seitz] Yes, sir. [engine rumbling] Thank you, Dede. Have any troubles? I lost a whole morning's business, that's trouble enough. [Emile grunts] What's this? A token of gratitude. You in funds? For once. A little. I suppose your life's worth that much. Thank you. -[bright music] -[residents chattering] [Emile] I'll take it. [Shopkeeper] Let me wrap it for you. Please. [ominous music] [priest speaking in foreign language] [Therese crying] [bright music] [residents chattering] [doll crying] Therese. Therese! Oh, I know I behaved badly. Here's some money. And I've got something for Renee. [doll crying] Think she'll like it? Why don't you ask her yourself. I will. I didn't know she was back. She was shot, a bullet in the heart. She must have died instantly and without suffering. You must be brave. It is the will of God. The will of God? Will of God? I don't understand! How? Who? You, you sent her out. You sent her to be killed! Murderer! [Therese crying] So you want to emigrate, huh? There's nothing to hold me here now. You will help me, Doctor, won't you? Nothing I should like better, but we must look at the picture from all angles. In the first place, there is the excellent work you are doing here. Frankly, I should be lost without you. You have a certain duty, you know. No, I'm finished, finished. Secondly, excuse the impertinence, but what capital resources have you? Capital resource? Oh, about 4,000 francs. Exactly. Yes, but what has money got to do with it? A great deal. For, myself as you know, I ask nothing, but even for you, I cannot endanger the whole escape route. A penniless man is bound to be picked up in a foreign country. No, money is essential. I know it's unfair, but to him that has to be given... From him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he have. My poor Emile, come back when you've robbed a bank or something and I'll see what I can do for you. [diners chattering] Ah, Blanchard. Permit me to offer you a drink. Eh, cognac. Two cognacs, the best you have. Well, I went to see your friend. Don't blame me, I told you what would happen. On the contrary, you misjudged the good doctor entirely. He's a very broad-minded man of the highest intelligence, far-sighted and most accommodating. He accepted you? You? [chuckles] My dear Blanchard, you're really naive. A man such as myself of a certain position and a certain fortune is always sure of a welcome. We, if you'll forgive the immodesty, are not as ordinary mortals, we're of the elite. For us all doors are opened, all frontiers are lowered and our errors of judgment are tactfully overlooked. When do you leave? Tonight. Our friend seemed very anxious to avoid any delay. I'm to be at his house at 9:45. I suppose there's no harm in your knowing. Let's drink to your departure. [Paul] Thanks. [footsteps tapping] [suspenseful music] -[object thuds] -[dramatic music] [soft ominous music] Come and sit down for a bit. I'll get your things. My wallet's gone. Your wallet? Oh, good thing they didn't find this. What a haul they'd have made. Ah, but there's no doubt what a very disagreeable experience. Oh, I've got a splitting head. My dear friend, why didn't you say so before? I have just the thing to cure it. Two aspirins. Oh, thanks. And a glass of cognac to wash them down. Thanks. Excellent cognac. I'm delighted you appreciate it. Later on I'll take you down to the cellar. Yes? Oh. [soft suspenseful music] [dramatic music] [glass breaking] [Emile coughing] [somber music] Therese! [coughs] Therese! [water pattering] [Emile coughing] [somber music continues] Emile, why did you bring me back? What have I go to live for now? What has either of us to live for, my poor Therese, except to plague each other? They took Renee away. I thought you'd gone, too. Would you have missed me if I had? You're better than nothing. You won't leave me now, will you? No, I suppose not. You will stay with me always, swear it. I shall stay with you always. Always? [German Soldier] Attention! Attention! By order of the German Regional Commander, demolition of the quarter known as the Old Port will commence at 1100 hours. Every building in this area will be destroyed. You have two hours in which to evacuate your home. Transports are waiting on the perimeter to transfer you to camps set up by the military authorities. -Any person found- -We'll manage somehow. [German Soldier] Within the area after 1100 hours is liable to be shot on sight. A warning siren- [liquid splashing] [cans clattering] [guns firing] For all we know he might've forgotten all about us. He brought us here, he'll take us out. You both heard? Yeah, we've heard all right. What will we do? Wait till Salvatore comes, what else can we do? We could've gone to see Emile a week ago -like I said. -Well, it's too late now. -Whose fault's that? -For heaven's sake! Well, how do we know it is too late? Look, he's got to get himself out, hasn't he? He may be able to take the two of us along. Well, it's worth a try, isn't it? What do you say? Maybe Jim is right. If there's a chance he can help you... Well how about you? Do not worry about me, so long as you are safe. We'll wait till Salvatore comes. [Lise sighs] [buckets rattling] [residents chattering] Three quarters of an hour left and still no ruddy Salvatore. [visitor knocking] That'll be him now. Oh, it's only me, dears. I just looked in to see if there's anything I can do. No thanks. Mrs. A, that chap you told me about, Emile Blanchard, is he on the level? Oh, I don't know much about him, dear, only what I told you. There was one chap went to him, though, a Pol I think he was, he must've got away all right because we never saw him again. That's good enough for me. I expect Mr. Blanchard's gone by now. Don't be a fool, Jim. [Jim] I'd rather be a fool than a Jerry prisoner. We've broken out before, we can break out again. Oh dear, hope I haven't said the wrong thing. For the last time, are you coming, Dave? No. [Jim] Please yourself. Just a moment, just a moment. Half of this is yours. -Good luck. -Thanks. Good luck, both. See you after the war, I hope. Goodbye, Mrs. Abou. Well, I must be toddling, too. Best of luck, dear. Thanks. You going to be all right? Oh, I don't know, dear. If you get back all right, have a pint of Guinness for me for old time's sake. Oh, I forgot you're a TT. For you I'll have a blooming gallon. -Bye-bye. -Ta-ta. Ta-ta. You are worried for your friend? We've been together for quite a while. I don't know, maybe I should have listened to him the first time, I don't know. If you hurry, you could still catch him up. I'm not going without you. [glass breaking] Mr. Blanchard? Do you know Mr. Blanchard? Mr. Blanchard? Do you know Mr. Blanchard? Mr. Blanchard. Over there, [speaking in French]. There? [sniffling] Emile, please. Be reasonable. Memories don't need to be packed in a suitcase. Here, take your winter clothes instead. -[fist pounding] -Mr. Blanchard! Mr. Blanchard! Mr. Blanchard? -Yes. -Oh, thank heavens. Mrs. Abou gave me your address. Dave! Look. Thought you'd given me up, huh? Just about. The Germans gave us little notice, I had much to do. Come on, let's get away. Where's your friend? He's not here, he's gone off. Where? Can you find him? I think so. Well, we'd better hurry. No, Dave, go with Mr. Salvatore. I will go after Jim and bring him to you. No, no, no, look, you'll never get through that mob. I'll find him. Salvatore, take her with you? You mean onboard? -Please. -Oh, impossible. There are already too many women. And at such a time my son's wife is having a baby, I regret. If she stays behind, I'm staying with her. No, Dave, no. Don't listen to him. You're a sentimental fool, but lucky for you, so am I. Come on. But if you don't find the Englishman quickly, you'd better come without him. I can't wait for you. [residents chattering] [bells ringing] [doorknocker tapping] Dr. Martout! Dr. Martout! [doorknocker tapping] Dr. Martout! Dr. Martout? [Dr. Martout grunts] I thought I'd missed you. You very nearly did. What do you want? I'm British. Mr. Blanchard gave me your address. Mr. Blanchard? Yeah, that's right. I'm not too late, am I? As a matter of fact, you're just in time. Come in, young man. [bells ringing] Want to have a little drink while you're waiting for me? No, no, thanks. Just one for the road as you English say, my best brandy. I don't usually touch spirits. Oh, but I insist. This is a special occasion, very special. You're going to bring my score up to a hundred. A hundred, huh? Good for you. It's a nice round number. Now, please, just this once, to please me, huh? Well, since it's a celebration. Here's to ya. [Jim coughing] Yeah, it's very nice, but it gets you in the throat a bit, doesn't it? It is a little strong, but the effect will soon pass off. You'll find it quite soothing. Now, excuse me, will you? Sit down and finish your drink. I'll be back shortly. Yeah, thanks a lot. -[bells ringing] -[residents chattering] [Madame Parfait shouting in French] [Rosanna moos] -[bells ringing] -[residents chattering] No, let me wait here. [bells ringing] [truck rumbling] -[bells ringing] -[residents chattering] Monsieur Blanchard! Monsieur Blanchard! I'm looking for a friend of mine that's an Englishman. Yes, I sent him to Dr. Martout. -What's the address? -13 Rue Garabaldi. Where is that? It's near the church. I say, be careful. I don't trust the doctor anymore. I told your friend the same thing. It's too late in any case. [bells ringing] If they don't come soon we'll have to sail without them. Oh no, please, you must wait. -Eh. -Please. [suspenseful music] [residents chattering] [suspenseful music continues] [Jim scoffs] [suspenseful music] [soft ominous music] Can I help you? I take it you did not finish your drink. Well, no, I- How foolish of you, how very foolish of you. Hold on, I only wanted- Put your hands behind your head. What for? You don't wanna shoot me, I'm British. Thought that your government would send a gunboat. In the meantime, do as I say. And turn around. Now walk backwards. Go on! [soft suspenseful music] Mind your step. -You- -Get in! [doorknocker tapping] -[dramatic music] -[gun fires] [doorknocker banging] Jim, are you there? [dramatic music continues] [glass breaks] Jim! [doorknocker banging] [soft suspenseful music] [doorknocker banging] Jim! [fist pounding] Jim! Jim, it's me, Dave! [gun firing] -[door slams] -[lock clicks] [soft ominous music] [door rattles] [Jim groans] [suspenseful music] [glass breaking] Dave! Dave! [suspenseful music] [gun fires] [dramatic music] Dave! Dave, you all right? Dave! Dave! [gun fires] [soft suspenseful music] [sculpture banging] [dramatic music] Nice friends you've got. -Where is he? -I don't know where he is. -Are you badly hurt? -No, it's just a leg wound. We'd better get outta here quick. I don't think we're gonna make it. Yeah, come on. I'll give ya a hand, come on. You picked a nice time to be a hero. Okay, yeah, come on. [engine rumbling] [tires screeching] [siren blaring] [seagull squawking] [tires screeching] -[tire pops] -[tires screeching] -[explosion booms] -[fire whooshes] [soldiers stomping] Cecilio, cast off. Come aboard, we're sailing. But you won't leave them behind. You cannot! What can I do? Look. In one moment it will be too late for all of us. Go if you must. I will stand right here. But you will be killed for nothing. Dave's still out there, let me go. Very well, then, I cannot stop you, but listen to me carefully. I'll put in at Malmousque. Yes. If you find them, bring them at once. -Yes. -But you must be quick. I cannot wait for you. Yes. There are others, huh? I understand, thank you. -[explosion booms] -[debris crashing] [explosion booms] -[explosion booms] -[debris crashing] Dave! [explosion booms] [debris crashing] -[explosion booms] -[debris crashing] -[explosion booms] -[debris crashing] [explosion booms] [explosion booms] [explosion booms] -[explosion booms] -[debris crashing] Dave! -[explosion booms] -[debris crashing] Dave! -Dave! -[explosion booms] Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. Oh, Dave, I thought I would never find you. What's happened? Nevermind that, why aren't you with Salvatore? -He would not wait. -[explosion booms] Looks like we've had it. No, Salvatore will go to Malmousque. It's a small harbor, about two kilometers from here. Can you walk? -I can try. -No, this way. [explosion booms] -[explosions booming] -[debris crashing] Huh, well? No sign of them. In all of that, what do you expect? [explosions booming] How much further? About halfway. Let me carry you, Dave. [explosions booming] [debris crashing] [explosions rumbling] Hey, Papa! [explosions rumbling] [Salvatore] Cecilio what are you waiting for? Cast off. [Cecilio] Excuse me, excuse me, we go now. Quick! Thanks for waiting, Salvatore. [bright orchestral music] [gentle romantic music] [dramatic orchestral music] [lion roaring]
