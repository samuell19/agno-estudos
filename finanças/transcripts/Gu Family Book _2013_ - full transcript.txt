Subtitles by DramaFever Episode 22 Yeo Wool. Kang Chi. I think it's time to let Kang Chi go, so he can find the Gu Family book. You're home? Yeah, I'm back. It must have been a hard day. Yes. A bit. I see. Let him go, Yeo Wool. Kang Chi will only be able to leave if you let him. What if Kang Chi becomes a Thousand Year demon like Wol Ryung? If he fails while looking for the Gu Family book, that may happen. All of that is for Kang Chi to decide. I know. But... And... You were the first one to want Kang Chi to find the Gu Family book and become human. If it's hard for you to tell him, I'll do it. No. I'll tell him. I'll do it. But... Just give me a little bit of time. Just two days. No, just give me three days. Then, I'll tell him. The time we have left... From now on... We have three days. In that time, will I be able to let you go, Kang Chi? - Yeo Wool. - Yeah? You... Why are you here like this? You cried so much last night that I couldn't leave you alone. How do you feel? Better? Yeah. Good. Yeo Wool. Yeah? It's morning. What? What do I do? The sun is already so high up. What do I do? What do I do? Why? It was a historical first night, but I just slept the whole night away. How disappointing. I guess you really are feeling better. Seeing you joking around like this. I guess. We have three days left. Why are you looking at me like that? What? Are you worried about something? No. I don't have any worries. Look, Kang Chi. Tell me three wishes you want me to grant for you. Three wishes? Why so suddenly? I just... want to make you feel better. Any wish at all? Yeah. Tell me. I'll grant them all. Let's see. First... First? Rice. - Rice? - Yeah. Rice made by you. That... rice? What's your second wish? Second... Oh, second... Choi Kang Chi, it's me. Choi Kang Chi, you're still not awake? He left? Yeah. I think so. Gon! Gon. You see... Shut up! Shut up, and die! Gon! It's not what you think. You're mistaken. - Gon, listen. - Gon. Gon! Excuse me. How embarrassing! Brother Gon, how can you do this? Madame Yeo Joo... What are you doing in here? You see, I was... I was telling the two of them not to do this. What? Not to do this? What were the two of them doing? They were doing something they shouldn't have been doing. - Lady Yeo Wool! - Yeo Wool! Oh, no! How embarrassing. Lady Yeo Wool, how could you say that? - Something we shouldn't be doing? - I'm talking about fighting. That's something you shouldn't be doing. What will you do if Madame Yeo Joo starts a rumor? That's what I'm saying. Misunderstanding is a very scary thing. So, stop misunderstanding Kang Chi and me. Lady! Lady. Why aren't you going? I'm going. You're laughing? You can laugh at a moment like this? I know... But, I'm able to laugh again. Things will pass... Thanks to the people by me, I can laugh again. Then, fine. Whatever it may be, get over it soon. As a man, you shouldn't let it get to you for too long. Yes. I understand. Thanks, Gon. Wol Ryung. It's been a while, So Jung. Wol Ryung. Is it really you? Are you my friend, Wol Ryung? Yes, it's me. I'm your friend, Wol Ryung. Wol Ryung. Finally, you have come back. Finally, you have come back! Wol Ryung. Monk, you're here? Why didn't you come in? Actually, I came because there's someone who wants to see you. Excuse me? What? - Rice? - Yes, rice. Teach me how to cook rice. But, why so suddenly? I'm not satisfied just knowing how to sew. So, teach me how to cook rice. This is your true self? Yes. Mother... She will be with me forever. We will never part again. I heard that Mother betrayed you. Perhaps, I'm the one who lost faith in her, first. The fear that she may betray me may have made me into that demon. I can't blame anyone for becoming a Thousand Year demon. It was my heart, my fears. I want to resent someone. Which one should I resent? You shouldn't have any resentment or vengeance. Those are feelings that go against nature. Believe in karma. You get what you deserve. You're talking like a mythical being... Did you say you want to become human? Then, don't have any fear in the decision you've made. If you are overcome by fear, you will lose everything. Do you understand? The opposite of faith is not doubt, it's fear. This... is the end? Probably. I see. Still, at times... on rare occasions... I will miss you. Like this, we move on. Like this, another goodbye has passed by. My Lord, it's Deputy Seo. My Lord! Chae Ryung has caught a bug, and sent it in. He's been spying on us. So, we brought him here for you to punish him. What? Gu Family book? Yes, Gu Family book. I want to find it. But, before then, I told you you would have to be able to control your mythical side. How did you do that? How? I've just learned to control my mythical side by myself. That quickly? I told you I would be able to do it. Then, as promised, will you tell me how to find the Gu Family book? This is the book. It will tell you how to find the Gu Family book. Think about it again. You really must become human? I've thought about it over a thousand times. I must become human. You don't know much about the life of a mythical being. Why don't you live as a mythical being, then decide which way you want to live your life. I want to age together with Yeo Wool. You'll have to pray for 100 days. - You must not eat any meat for 100 days. - I can do that. You must not turn down a human's request for help. I can do that, too. You must not show your mythical side in front of humans. That means... During the 100 days, no human can find out that you're a mythical being. - What about the ones who already know? - You'll have to leave them. - But if I'm successful, I can come back, right? - But, no one has ever been successful. - Including your father, Wol Ryung. - I know that. - If you break any of the rules, you'll... - I'll become a Thousand Year demon, right? - Like Wol Ryung. - You still want to find the Gu Family book? I already told you. My dream is to age together with Yeo Wool. I don't even want to think about being left alone in a world without Yeo Wool. Kang Chi. You really don't know? What do you mean? If you can avoid it, you should avoid this fate. What if I can't avoid that fate? Then what will happen? One of the two may end up dying. What do you mean? One of you may end up dying. My Lady. How many have you broken already? That's what I'm saying. Why does everything break when I touch it? This is special medicine that Master Gong Dal made. What's all this ruckus? Yeo Wool, and Madame Yeo Joo... What are you doing in my kitchen? You see... We were in the middle of a lesson. Lesson? In my kitchen? Yes, it was a lesson. Cooking lesson. One of us... may end up dying? Yes, one of you will be brought to death. Since you are immortal, if one dies, who do you think that will be? No. That can't be. Trust me. I've never been wrong. I don't care. If something happens to Yeo Wool, I can save her. I've already saved her once. You didn't know? You can only save a human life once as a mythical being. Only once for a given person? A life that's been saved by a mythical being, can't be saved again. So, you should give up on Lady Yeo Wool. Leave her. If I find the Gu Family book, and become human... If I become human, my fate will change, too. That's not your fate, it's Lady Yeo Wool's fate. What? Any person she meets under the peach tree with a crescent moon is ill-fated for Lady Yeo Wool. A peach tree with a crescent moon? No way... Back then... That was Yeo Wool? It's up to you whether you find the Gu Family book. But, you can't control Lady Yeo Wool's fate. Do you understand? What are you doing here? Oh, it's nothing. It doesn't seem like it's nothing. I can tell something's wrong. What is it? You and I... One of us will die. Yeo Wool might die. Strange... What's wrong? What is it? And you? Why are you out here? I was waiting for you. Why? Your first wish. Here it is. Dam Yeo Wool's first ever cooked rice! What do you think? I made this rice. It seems so moist, right? Hurry, and try it. Hurry. So, you just made the rice? Just the rice? Do you know how long it took to make this? Then, let me try it. What was that? I don't know. I didn't hear anything. I think it was a pebble. Spit it out. Hey, you shouldn't swallow that. It's good. Maybe because you made it, even the pebble tastes good. We have three days left together. You and I... One of us will die. Will I be able to let you go, Kang Chi? What should I do about you, Yeo Wool? Now, tell me. What? Your second wish. Second wish? My second wish... Kang Chi. Teacher. There's a guest from the Hundred Year Inn. - Eok Man! - Kang Chi! Tell me. Who put you up to this? Was it Admiral Lee Soon Shin? Or Dam Pyung Joon? I'm going between the two, getting information from both. Are you saying you've been working between them as a double spy? That way I'm useful to both sides. I can't read you at all. What's your true intent? What is it that you want? Seeing that you are curious, I guess you are finally ready to negotiate with me. What? - Negotiate? - Yes, negotiate. Do you even know what kind of a situation you are in? With my command, you'll be killed instantaneously. Then, do that! As soon as you kill me, your life will end, too. According to the information I have you'll soon be slain by Admiral Lee Soon Shin's sword. - What? - What will you do? Will you make a deal with me? Or... Will you get killed by the admiral? I just heard from Eok Man. That Tae Seo is in danger. - That's why I'm going to the navy base. - I'll go with you. Please let me go with you. You're feeling better? Yes, Master. Follow me. I heard something happened last night. Last night, someone stole the map that was left here. - Was it the Goon Bon merchants? - It seems that way. The day Wol Ryung came into the village, they knew the navy would be ill-manned. I think that's when they stole it. That takes care of our first objective here. - Nothing will please Lord Toyotomi more... - But... When we went to get that map, we saw a strange looking ship. A strange looking ship? I've never seen anything like it. Do you know what it is? Did it look like this? You know about this ship? I heard that Lee Soon Shin is planning on building it, but I didn't think he actually could. He really made a model for a ship like this? Yes. I saw it with my own eyes. What kind of a ship is this? It's called the Turtle Ship. Turtle Ship? You'll really be able to build a ship like this? First, we'll have to make a model, and test it out a few times. By the middle of next month, we will finish a model ship 20 times bigger than this. I see. It's great. It's really great. Fortunately, the plans for the Turtle Ship was kept hidden in this room, so it was safe. Still, the fact that we lost the map will work against us, no? The map they took was a fake one. They can't find out the exact locations of the naval bases in the Southern Province. Furthermore... They can't find out the exact locations of the coastal lines and the rivers. Then, what should we do about Tae Seo? Should I go, and save him? Just give me your command. I'll do everything I can. Did you say a deal? I did. So, what is it that you want to gain? I want to take back the Hundred Year Inn. Clear my father's name, and hand me back the inn. After that, return my sister. Then... I'll spare your life. If the information you have is a lie, or useless, I will kill you without any hesitation. Admiral Lee Soon Shin has a list of names that Ja Hong Myung gave him. What? Lee Soon Shin has the list of your 11 allies who have received Goon Bon money. He will soon call them in, and start questioning them. If one of them mentions your name... what do you think will happen? Then, do you have a way to avoid that situation? First, write a promissory note that you will give me the ownership to the inn. You don't have much time. You should hurry. I'll let you be in charge of running the inn, like now. As soon as this commotion is over, I'll also free your sister. That's my condition. What will you do? Will you die along with everyone else? Or... will you take control over the inn, and free your sister? Kill everyone. Before the admiral makes his move, you should kill all 11 of them. For now, that's the only way. This is the list of the 11 names that Merchant Ja Hong Myung gave me. Deputy Kim, you should bring in the 11 men listed there to the navy base. Yes, sir. Master Dam, you should watch the movements of the Goon Bon merchants and Jo Gwan Woong. I'll do that. And the three of you, I have something to request of you. Choi Joon Young, Jang Hoo Do, Kim Bum Joo, and Hong Sa Myung... They have all been killed. Before the night is gone, we'll take care of Moo Ahn, Hwa Soo, and Han Pyung Jo. - Take care of it all tonight. - Yes, sir. What's going on? Why are you killing those on our side? All of this is because you weren't able to get rid of Ja Hong Myung! What? Yoon Seo Hwa, that wretch, has given the list to Lee Soon Shin. If something goes wrong, I will die. And before you can go back to your land, you may all be killed, too. We can find other people to help us. Right now, we should focus on saving our lives, no? My Lord, Lee Soo Yul, Im Sang Kyu, and Han Yi Sa have come to meet with you. If you don't meet with them, they said they would go to the navy base so I kept them at Choon Hwa Gwan for now. - Get the men ready. - Yes, sir. Sir, there's a message from Head Mistress Chun. The three remaining men on that list are at Choon Hwa Gwan waiting for Jo Gwan Woong. Prepare 10 of the best men. I'll go there myself. Yes, sir. To get to the annex, it would be best to go through the west gate. I know that way well. I'll lead. - From here on, Gon and I will go alone. - What? You wanted to know my second wish, right? Wait here. That's my second wish. Kang Chi. This is a mission. We got an order from Admiral Lee. - This shouldn't have to do with your wish. - A promise is a promise. Until Gon and I return from fulfilling the mission, stay here and wait. - Kang Chi. - The two of us are enough, right? - It'll be fine. - Did you hear? - But, Kang Chi... - I'll be back. Wait here. Then, we'll be back. What happened? Chung Jo just went to the guest room. Is Lord Jo coming, or not? How can this be? We shouldn't have sided with him. What brings you to this room? Nice to meet you. My name is Chung Jo. Head Mistress sent me to cheer you up. What would you like? Would you like to listen to Guh Moon Go, or the Ga Ya Geum? No need. We don't need anything. Sir! You're finally here. We've been waiting for you for so long. Wol San, take the girls out. - I have something important to talk about. - Yes, my Lord. Why aren't you leaving? Don't you think there should be someone to pour the liquor? Since when were you so eager to pour liquor? Why are you doing this to me? When I said that I will become yours when you become mine I meant that I would not let it go if you betrayed me. Do you understand? Get out! What is going on? Everyone's been wiped out in one day. Now, only the three of us remain. Do you think all this is the work of Admiral Lee Soon Shin? No, if it was Lee Soon Shin, he wouldn't have killed them like that. He would have brought in at least one, and questioned him until he mentioned my name. What? This won't change anything. But, that was the best I could do. Then, it was you... At times, one needs to know when to cut off a tail in order to survive. That took care of all 11 of them. Good job. What's this? What brings you to a gisaeng house? I heard there are traitors here, I came to capture them. You're working hard for the sake of the nation. Find out what happened. Sir, the three remaining on the list have all been found dead. - All three of them? - Yes, sir. Oh, no... I guess something has happened to the traitors? Does that take care of all of the 11 traitors? Yes, sir. All of the 11 traitors have been eliminated. Have you ever heard of letting the two tigers fight to get rid of the problem? You get what you want without doing any work by making two tigers fight each other. I was able to take care of 11 traitors so easily. That's a relief. What's wrong? Were you involved in this, too? What are you talking about? Are you trying to accuse me of being a traitor? Well... I'm thinking about what I should do with you. You should be fully prepared before attacking me. I think so, too. Then, be careful on your way back. Good job. Stop. Lady Yeo Wool. Stop! Are you Kageshima? I am. This is from the admiral. Yeo Wool. Are you okay? Saving a life with the blood of a mythical being... That can only be done once for a given person. Please. Please. Stop this. Kang Chi. Yeo Wool. Yeo Wool. I heard you're badly injured. What happened? I'm fine. I just got scratched by a sword. I heard you got hurt because of Kang Chi. No, Father. Kang Chi was busy fighting the ninjas. He didn't even let me come into the inn, fearing I would get hurt. I didn't listen. That's why this happened. I'm serious, Father. As she said, the wound is healing. Don't worry. Have you ever heard of letting the two tigers fight to get rid of a problem? - Chae Ryung is here. - Tell him to come in. What is it? Give me ten talented ninjas. Can I ask you the reason? Lee Soon Shin. I must kill him. Teacher. I heard you got hurt. Is it okay for you to come out? It's nothing. I'm fine. But, where's Kang Chi? Have you seen him? Kang Chi. I knew you would be like this. I knew you would be down. Your arm... How is it? It doesn't hurt at all. Master Gong Dal has a lot of good medicine. I took medicine, and put ointment on, too. The bleeding has stopped. And I feel just fine. Don't worry. You should go in. Kang Chi! Why are you doing this? It wasn't your fault. You didn't do it on purpose. I wasn't in my right mind. After smelling blood I was fighting half out of my mind. Kang Chi. Next time, it won't stop with just a wound to the arm. I may even cause you to die. You... Did you hear something? You did. Right? The one you meet by the peach tree underneath the crescent moon is ill-fated for you. And that person... is me. Kang Chi. When you know that, why did you let this happen? I wasn't scared by a prophesy like that. - You can die! - Because of an uncertain future... I didn't want to lose you, Kang Chi. If you're overcome with fear, you'll lose everything. But, I'm scared. Yeo Wool... may die. Kang Chi. This is the end of our relationship. You... What are you saying? That... is my third wish, Dam Yeo Wool. Subtitles by DramaFever
