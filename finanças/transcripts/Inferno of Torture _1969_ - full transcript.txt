TOEI COMPANY LTD. INFERNO OF TORTURE PRODUCED BY SHIGERU OKADA & KANJI AMAO SCREENPLAY BY TERUO ISHII & MASAHIRO KAKEFUDA CAST: TERUO YOSHIDA MASUMI TACHIBANA YUMIKO KATAYAMA, MIEKO FUJIMOTO, YUKIE KAGAWA SHINICHIRO HAYASHI, ASAO KOIKE DIRECTED BY TERUO ISHII GRAVE OF GENZO There... This is it. This small key... ...has locked away my womanhood. I'll be a woman again. What do I do now? Now what do I do? Still the same, I see. Sorry, I was going to come. Even if you can't pay, you should still come by. If you steal five ryo from someone, you'll be exiled. If it's nine ryo, your head will roll! I'm not lying to you. Just ask him. I was forced to serve a man named Samejima as security for my debt. It was a strange house. The hallway curved on and on and seemed never-ending. There were many peculiar small rooms, all garishly colored. Strange men and women. What is this place? What should I do for you, sir? Instead of explaining, I'll show you. Come here... ...and observe. You look surprised. I assume you must be a virgin. If so, I can remedy that for you. It's bound to happen sometime anyway! Let me go! You're a newcomer, right? Don't just stand there with your mouth shut. Greet us! Or you think that you can't even greet women like us? Say something! You're a strange creature. Forgive me... I didn't know about such places. "Such places" you say? Hey, everyone, I don't think she's been tattooed yet. Let's have a look. Stop it! I only teased her a little, then she ran in here. She looks promising, Samejima. Stop it! Don't spoil the merchandise! If you do whatever we tell you and earn money, you'll live well. She shows great promise. Genzo raped one girl after another without the madam's knowledge. I'll share the same fate as them. Water... - Water? - Give me water. I'll let you drink, I'll let you drink... Shall I? Shall 1? Drink it. Drink it. Then, let Yumi drink some. Understand? Why aren't you drinking it? Yumi! Open your mouth! Open your mouth, Yumi. Yumi, why aren't you drinking? Yumi... Open your mouth. More! Drink more, Yumil! The house with the tattooed whores was like hell. Any tattoo artist would be fascinated by this perfect skin. If the Shogun judges my tattoo best in the competition, then I shall succeed Horigoro. And then, Osuzu... Osuzu! Then my father will marry me to the winner? Horitatsu kept on at your father about that. He made that promise just to get rid of him. I shall speak with my father. Osuzu! Father, did you really promise Horitatsu? Their skills are about the same. Horitatsu's tattoos are filled with an aura of imminent violence. It's like the art of darkness. Horihide's are bright, with pure and refined expressions. Osuzu, it's pretty clear to me who the winner will be. I can't lose. It's a match, betting my love and pride. I have to win. Osuzu, I will win. For sure! Don't hide yourselves away. You shouldn't bother me at this very important stage. You must leave. May I continue? Yes, it's fine by me. Then please persevere a little longer. He's like a madman. There are people who say his skills are superior to Master Horigoro. All well-known artists have their quirks. That's why I tolerate him. Then he's doing a good job? He refuses to let me see. - Welcome, sir. - I have good news for you, madam. We have plenty of girls now, Master Samejima. - You're not in a good mood, eh? - Please... - Anything wrong? - Nothing at all. I have some news that will bring in more customers. If this deal settles, we'll need all the girls we can get. Why don't they undress? Get their clothes off! Wonderful! I want you to arrange for plenty of women just like these. Girls with tattoos are expensive. Is that alright? As long as they're beautifully tattooed, I'll pay any price. Once you've seen a woman strip herself naked, you can't help but want her. - You like that? - Not now. Let's get started. Come on, come on... You have such a fine tattoo. Oh! You should walk around showing it off to the public. Well, now, let's get to work... Don't do that, it hurts. I want to touch your belly again. Oh, I love to be touched. Touch wherever you want. Really? This is the best belly in the world. Amazing! Ohako! Hey, you! What's wrong? Don't stop halfway through! I love you. Come on, they've arrived. There are few things I'd like to ask you. Come out so I can question you. You must miss the outside world. Don't ask me that. Of course I do. I'm going to get you out. Master, do you really mean that? - But only if you do exactly as I say. - Yes, I shall. - Then you must break out of jail. - Break out? Actually, there are ten women I'd like to question secretly. I want you to get them out. So, answer me. I'd rather stay here than take such a risk. Impossible! You have no choice, now that I've told you my secret. I'll never talk, Master. I heard nothing. - Please, sir! - Then you'll die. How could you? It may seem unreasonable, but it's what I demand. I'll just say that you died because you resisted interrogation! Wait, please. I'll do as you ask. Please put your sword away. So you'll do it? So... which women? Numbers eight... ten... ...twenty-four... ...twenty-six... Number fifteen! Number twenty-one! Well? Number eighteen! Yes! Just me? I'll be so lonely. - Number nineteen! - Yes! We'll be together. Aren't we lucky? It's tonight. Are you all ready? But can we really make it out? Everything's perfectly arranged. If there are any cowards amongst you, speak up now. Well, then, how about it? Anyone who opposes us will die. It's finished. It's done! You like it, don't you? - You understand? - Of course I do. Your skill lies in your eyes and hands working in harmony. I now understand how beautiful your work is. You've borne it well. You must've suffered. Your skin mustn't be spoiled. This is a technique I stole from my master and developed. Come. - Where to? - The obvious place! You allowed me to work on your skin, so you must view the work first. You and I will view it before the Shogun does. Come! Though it felt like a daily torture, the time spent with the tattoo artist became a consolation. What's happened? Why are you crying suddenly? At first, I felt scared, and shameful. It was painful. But now, being along with you... I beg you, take me away from here! I'll do anything for you. I beg you! Horihide... It's about time you showed her to me. Not yet! You can't see her yet! It must be hard, being tortured every day. Or have you become one of Oryu's lesbians? Horihide has gone... ...and this horrible Genzo will rape me. I see... Any man or woman would be attracted to you. Be quiet! I'll show you what really pleases a woman. Now I made you a woman. This is how a man and a woman should be. Genzo! You! Please forgive me. Please! Genzo... I'll have you castrated for this. Disappear, you lot. Please! At least let my sister go! Punish me as much as you want, but spare her! Torturing your body doesn't make me feel as good. That hurts! Yuki, it must be unbearable for you, seeing your brother like this. Shall I fix it so you'll never see him again? Yuki! Stop it! Please, stop it. Stop! How pitiful it sounds, from one who's tortured so many girls himself. And who made me into such a man? You owe me for saving you right before you were going to hang yourself. And I even brought up your little sister. You owe me. You heartless bitch! I see... I'll pay you back for that. All who oppose me... will suffer like this. I'll render you unable to be with any man! Stand up! No! - Don't! - Come now, Yumi... Stop! As long as it remains locked... you shall not be a woman. As a woman, you're useless now. Open your mouth! There! You can't exploit her anymore now. So... you're saying Genzo is dead? - It just happened. - You've made a big mistake. This isn't a joke. You must advise me how to cover it up. We'll say he died of an illness, and hold a fine funeral for him. Just make sure that no one digs up his corpse later. Today, I have something to tell you. All of you, roll up your sleeves. This shows you're an ex-convict from the Tosa Clan. - This one's from the Kumamoto Clan. - I'm from Sendai. By erasing these tattoos, you can still get away even if you're captured. Your criminal markings can be covered by tattooing. Is such a thing possible? I've arranged some well-known tattooists for you in Edo. Master, you're taking such care of us... it feels strange. - Right? - I agree, it does! What can we do to thank you, Master? I want you to work for me for two years. Work like geisha. Geisha? You'll have high-class customers. You might make your fortunes. Wonderful! I'm so happy! That tickles. Do it more firmly. Ouch! Stop it! Stop. What a strange design. This one's even stranger... I see. I'll tattoo a masterpiece, but I must have a subject with suitable skin. We've given you the finest girls available, and still you're not satisfied? Madam... I'd like to talk with you somewhere private. What? Catching a pretty girl like me... Hey, baby! Why would you tattoo someone like me? Just look at your skin. I want fair white skin like yours. Look how beautiful it is. Please. I must win the Shogun's competition to be a real man. So please help. Wait a moment! I'll show you someone much more to your taste. You'll adore this very special woman. Horitatsu is distraught, because he can't find someone with suitable skin. If he doesn't, you will win for sure, Horihide. Osuzu, so you're saying that I'll lose if Horitatsu finds a beautiful skin? That's not... That's not what I meant. I apologize if I offended you. I'm sorry. No, I'm the one who should be sorry. Please don't be like that. Smile for me. Horihide... Don't worry. I'll be sure to win. What is this? They've covered up my work. Please forgive me, Horihide. It happened after you left. On madam's orders. She sent me to Horitatsu. How is this skin? If you tattoo her skin, the competition title will be yours. Wait. Come closer. Let me see it. Who tattooed this? It's called "The Tortures of Hell" by Horitatsu. It's marvelous. An incomparable masterpiece. Wait! - Excuse me. - What impudence before His Excellency! Nevertheless, she hasn't revealed the whole tattoo yet. What are you saying? If she drinks a cup of sake, you'll see. Is this some trick? Offer her some sake. Damn it. A double tattoo. Turn around. It's amazing that two competitors worked on one woman's skin. The designs and the colors are good. Both artists have displayed incredible talent. So it's a tie. It's a good thing that we entered Yumi in the tattoo competition. She'll attract high-class customers all the time now. Even so, Horitatsu's design was superb. Something's the matter with her. I wonder if she's... I was right. She's pregnant. How is it? Is it hot? It's impossible that you got hold of the key. The only way you'll give birth is if the baby comes out of your mouth! I want the key. The key... Maybe it's better this way. My unborn child and I can't escape our cursed fate. For the heinous crime of defiling the dead, you are sentenced to death by fire. Throw the torches! A filthy tattoo done by a prisoner... Who pinned Horigoro's murder on me? Osuzu... I will escape, no matter what. Osuzu! Osuzu! Hide... I swore I'd never let anyone but you see me and touch me. My skin is being soiled by ink. I can testify that it was you who killed Horigoro. I've prepared evidence that you did this. You killed him for not being chosen as his successor, and because your lover, Osuzu, was taken by another disciple. However, it all depends on you. I can just as easily make it look like Horihide killed him. You'll take possession of Osuzu, too. Out of the way! Move! Horihide! Horihide! Wait! Osuzu... I'm innocent. I shall return. On the eighth day of the Fukagawa Myojin Festival. Take this and think of me. I shall see you then. I'm innocent. I shall return. On the eighth day of the Fukagawa Myojin Festival. Take this and think of me. I shall see you then. I promise. I'll let you see Horihide. The ship's about to set sail! Hurry, all! Horihide... forgive me. My skin has been ruined. Horihide! - What are you playing at? - Don't get smart, you idiot! Well... Shut up. Hey, looking for trouble? You should be ashamed of yourselves. You want to see something nice, feast your eyes on this! Hey! Don't you know who I am? Who are you to talk to me? I've killed and I've robbed, and I had eight years left in prison. I'm the boss, Oryu the Viper. - Now do you know me? - Never heard of you. I've been screwing men since the age of three. And I know every sexual trick in the book. Once, I even pleasured sixty men in a row! You can call me Omatsu the Man-eater! Well, I'll introduce myself next. I'm Okura, hairy-chested, fat and middle-aged. I'll show you what I've got. Just get a load of my wonderful tits! Shut your mouth! Oh, I'm sinking! No, not me! No! I'm scared! Help us, someone! Help! I'm scared! Help me! Hey! Cut it out! - Stop it! - Listen! Your bodies are important. You can't scar them! You must try to get along with each other. You'll all be working together in Nagasaki. Right, fall back, you lot! NAGASAKI. I've ordered plenty of tattooed girls from Hong Kong, Macao and Portugal. In my country, tattooed virgins are very much in demand. We're having several virgins tattooed now. I want to see my elder brother. If I can't, I want to die! Don't say that. But we can never go back to Edo, can we? They'll force us to be tattooed. Damn it. These bastards are going to sell us all to foreigners! I suspected something strange. Well, we don't have to take this! You'd better do as you're told. You know that you all agreed to work for two years. What are you trying to trick us into? We were told we'd be entertaining high-class customers! We're more than just playthings for hairy foreigners! This, my beauties, is a house of horrors. Horitatsu's a foolish man. He thinks she'll be his once he's tattooed her. Osuzu belongs to me! Osuzu... No! No! Osuzu, you must forget about Horihide. No! Horihide will return for sure! Osuzu... If you're not given to me, some foreigner will make you his mistress. Come, come. No! - You shall be mine. - No! No! Horitatsu! What are you doing? I will not tattoo anymore. I'm onto you both. Horitatsu, get to work immediately on Osuzu's tattoo! I refuse. I won't accept your refusal. Go ahead and intimidate me, if you like. I'll say that it was you who killed Horigoro! Horitatsu, you can tell them whatever you want. Who do you think they'd believe, you or me? - You killed my father? - That's right. Horitatsu here helped us to frame Horihide for it. Horitatsu! Is that true? Is it, Horitatsu? Well, say something! He wanted revenge on Horihide because of you. You were taken in by a terrible man like this. Now it's your turn to feel the needle. In thanks for all that fine work you did for us... I can't stand it anymore. I must escape somehow! What are you doing? I have no time for you! Oh, I like you. What are you doing...? Go after them! Come and play! Yuki... - Go on without me. - Don't be silly. Come on! I can't go any further. Yuki, go to the Fukagawa Myojin Festival once you arrive Edo. A man named Horihide will be there waiting for me. Please tell him what's happened. Also... you must make sure that you give him this. No, don't leave me alonel We can't escape together. Be strong, don't give up. Listen, I'll act as a decoy while you'll escape. Alright? You're not this island, are you? Never seen your face before. - Come along with me. - No, thanks! Stop! Hey, the man you're with is a brute. Bitch! Watch what you say! Come, come. Nothing to be afraid of, eh? I'll wash every nook and cranny of you. So, do as I say, and you'll make a very good living. She's filthy. Where did you find her? Let's see the face. - Bitch. - No! What the hell? She's blind. You always bring back the sick and troubled ones. What are you talking about? Take a look at her skin. She's no ordinary piece of merchandise, this one. And you won't short-change me on her! I can make good money on her. She's worth at least four ryo. I might even get five ryo for her. What? Don't push your luck. You don't have to take her. That foreigner Clayton will give me ten ryo for her. You bastard! Get out of here! Master! Master! Master, will you take on a job for me? I refuse. I'll pay you handsomely. I'm sick of working on men's oily skin. I understand that. This one's a young virgin. Just look at her skin! A tattoo will look good on her. Planning on selling her to Clayton? You know how miserable they end up, those women sold to Clayton? Who are you to preach? You're an escaped convict, fleeing exile on an island. Everyone here has a murky past. I'll live as I like. Horitatsu! Are you working on her again? Please, give me a hit! Please! I beg you! Be quiet! The sooner you finish, the sooner you'll get your shot. I can't stand the suffering! Give it to me! Damn you! - Please! - What do you think you're doing? How pitiful. Edo's most famous tattoo artist in such a state! Please, give it to me. Give it to me. Give me a hit! It can't be helped. - This is all for now. - Thanks! When the job's completed, you'll get all the drugs you want. I have been tattooed at last. What will I do now? What will I do? You always just sit there. You should run away from that man. Go home. I don't care anymore. What's this? - Where did you get this? - Please, give it back to me. It was entrusted to me. Do you know Osuzu? Then... you're Horihide? Osuzu... Osuzu... I won't let you go again, Osuzu! Horihide! Osuzu! This isn't a dream, is it? You came back from the island, just as you promised. Osuzu... But it's too late. Osuzu, what's happened? I'm ruined, Horihide. Osuzu! Horihide... my father was murdered. Samejima and Oryu... the two of them killed him. And they brought me here. Samejima and Oryu? And Horitatsu helped them to frame you so you'd be exiled. What? Horitatsu did? And also Horitatsu... ...he ruined my skin. Horitatsu worked on your skin? Horihide, I'm sorry that I ended up this way. Damn them! I'll kill those who did this to you. No, you aren't that kind of person. You couldn't do such a thing. Osuzu... Osuzu, what's wrong? Osuzu... Horihide... Hold me. Hold me tightly. Osuzu, don't die! Don't die! Osuzu! Osuzu! Osuzu... I swear I'll have my revenge. I'll start with Clayton's beloved daughter. I'll show you how Osuzu was made to suffer! Horitatsu... Horitatsu! I have another job for you. I'm... not your slave. What? Horitatsu! So you have no interesting in competing against Horihide? Horihide? This letter's from him. He escaped from his island exile and came here to Nagasaki. "I have seen every detail of Osuzu's tattoo. "I'll create a tattoo, the likes of which you've never seen.” Where's Horihide? I want to see who's better. What's he up to? Wait! Where's Horitatsu? Capture that madman! Horihide, let go of the girl... ...and your life will be spared. I'll give you a taste of the pain that both I and my master suffered! Osuzu was promised to me as my wife. Her suffering was mine. Now you'll know her pain! Die and go to hell! Horitatsu, I challenge you! Fly! Turn around! I've lost. Clayton, you're trafficking in tattooed women! Aided by Oryu, Samejima and Horitatsu! And you've tricked all these women into a miserable existence! Please... I didn't do anything bad to Osuzu. - These people were responsible. - That's a lie! He wanted her for himself. Shut up! You're all the same. I'll pay you all back. Don't move! If anybody moves, your daughter dies. Stop, please. I didn't know anything. Osuzu's anguish inhabits this tattoo. It's nothing compared to what you're going to suffer! I didn't know! Horihide... you mustn't die. I'll make you suffer more than the suffering you've caused! Suffer now! Horitatsu! Sorry. I'm a pitiful human being. I've ruined your life and Osuzu's life. Forgive me. Horihide... I think Horigoro would've wanted you to become his successor. I'm counting on you. Horitatsu! I'll send the father and daughter both to hell! You mustn't, Horihide. No, you aren't that kind of person. You couldn't do such a thing. This is Dejima! Do you plan to arrest me here? Hold your tongue! Go! Get out! Go now! Go! Just go without me! Forgive me... I lost my mind. There's no hope for us anymore. Forgive me! Oryu conspired with Clayton to sell tattooed girls as prostitutes abroad, and was sentenced to execution by dismemberment. THE END
