[film projector running] [birds squawking] [child laughing] [music playing] Subtitles by explosiveskull [pickaxe clanging] [man] Captain Roy Struthers? Get out here. - What's this? - Name's Vance Edison. I was hired by a man named Cole Roberts from Jackson Ridge to reclaim this here mine. He rightfully owns it now. Is that right? That's the money you paid for it, plus a little extra for showing gold. You can't sell land to a hard-working man, then after he finds gold on it, take it back. This land belongs to the Struthers family! I don't think you're understanding me. I'm here to tell you to clear out of this here mine now. Best take that money and go, captain. You son of a bitch! Jesse, get down to the river and fetch some water! - Pa, I think I... - Now, damn it! Now you listen to me, you son of a bitch. There ain't nothing or nobody gonna kick me off my land. So you go on back down that hill and you go tell Cole to clear this up. You listen to me, you stubborn old coot! I'll give you ten seconds to gather your things and start saddling your horses. Maybe we should go see the sheriff now? We ain't going nowhere till this son of a bitch gets off my land! Run. Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! [Western music plays] Hey, Vance. Look at that. Is that the son of Roy Struthers down there? You shut your mouth. Who's asking? Just a lone traveler. Lone traveler, we ain't kind to strangers 'round here. You'd best get on your way. - Jesse! - Goddamn it, mister! You need to mind your own business! [gunshot] [gunshot] Hyah! Jesse! Jesse! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Put your hands where I can see 'em. Now just who the hell are you and how do you know my name? I'm a very good friend of your father's, son. Served together in the cavalry. Last good friend of my father just hired someone to murder him. Who's the son of a bitch that had him killed? [people clamoring] Get that filth out of here, boys. Hold on, ya bunch of pack rats! Don't shoot! It's me. Charlie. Where the hell is Vance, Charlie? He got shot dead. Hell, he went after Jesse Struthers. We got Roy, though. But the boy... ...the boy escaped. He escaped, huh? I'll be Goddamned. He killed Vance Edison. Cole, I've been running all day and, well, I was wondering if you had a little swig of water. Sure I do, Charlie. Just a second. No, don't! Rest in eternal peace, brother. Amen. Where are you headed? I'm going after that son of a bitch Cole Roberts. I'm gonna kill him. Damn, you're bull-headed. Where's your brother? [snoring] [groans] Dad's dead. Yeah, I know. How do you know? I got a letter. A letter from who? It didn't say. Well, it had to say where it was from. Who the hell are you? Name's Virgil Calhoun. I was one of your father's closest friends. [laughs] "I was one of his closest friends." Hey! How 'bout some shots, huh? A toast to Dad. Come on. Get up here, Jesse. - [clears throat] - [bottle uncorks] To the late and great Captain Roy Struthers. May he rest in eternal peace. [chuckles] That son of a bitch. [grunts] Get up! Come on! Goddamn it, you two! That's enough! You two need to start acting like grown men. [both coughing] Here's to Captain Roy Struthers, a man who lived and died with integrity. Saddle up. We're gonna see some friends. [quiet Western music plays] It'll be just a moment, dear. Is it all done? Not exactly. Jesse killed Vance Edison and escaped. But I've got somebody who'll take care of it - once and for all. - I don't care who you get. Just get it done. Soon as he is marked as dead, the county can seize the property. I'll take care of it, Donald. And what about the youngest? What is being done about him? Ah, he's a leaky vessel. We'll get him to sign over the land. Time is money, Cole. Carlos? Cole. I need you to track down an outlaw and kill him. How much? I'll pay you $1,000. You bring him to me in a week. [clicks tongue] [Cole] 2,000. That's my final offer, and you get him to me in three days. Carlos Van Pelt at your service. Name is Jesse Struthers. [fly buzzing] Horse? Rides a black mare. Where was he last seen? Red Rock Quarry, about a day ago. You kill him. I'll see you here in three days' time. - Hyah! - [Cole] Billy, you take Curly and you trail him by half a day. And, Billy... no matter what, you bring me the corpse of Jesse Struthers. - What was that? - Jake. Put that pistol away. Now. Do exactly what I say. [quiet music plays] I'm sorry I wasn't there for you, my son. Psst. Billy. Why are you following me? [grunts] Oh, Billy, Billy. You really must get control of your emotions. Could get you killed one day. Well, boys, I guess you won't be needing these fine horses anymore. - [Carlos] Old man! - [horse whinnies] Well? What's it gonna be? Pistols or knives? I like you. Yes. I think I can kill you with just a knife. I ain't gonna be that easy. [both grunt] - Aah! - [knife cuts] - [grunts, exclaims] - [knife cuts] Feels good, doesn't it? Makes you feel alive. [grunts] - [grunts, exclaims] - [knife cuts] [both grunting] [horse whinnies] - [knife cutting] - [Jesse] Virgil! [grunts] No! - [grunts] - [grunts] Run. Jake! Jake! Jake! Jake! You are one tough son of a bitch. Jesse Struthers. I've got to get your corpse back to Jackson Ridge. But we do have some time to kill. This is the part I love the most. Gah! [gun clicks] [clicks] [groaning] - [yells] - [knife plunges] [rasping] Why'd he have to take our goddamn horses? Who goes there? Jake Struthers. Put your goddamn gun away, Billy. I need to speak with Cole. Things have changed. He ain't gonna be happy about this. Virgil! [sobs] [labored breathing] My boy. Virgil. Virgil! Virgil. Virgil! [panting] [panting] Jake! [yelling] - [yells] - [grunts] - [children laughing] - [men chanting] [groans playfully] [tribal music playing] [both grunting] [groans] [both grunting] This is the part I love the most. [grunts] [groaning] [panting] [snoring] [shudders] [Western music playing] Hi there, Sissy. You're looking beautiful today. Can you at least say hi? You lost, boy? No, I don't reckon I am. Dumb son of a bitch. You shoot, I blow your goddamn head off! Well, why don't you do me a favor and put me out of my misery? Go on, now. I think this son of a bitch just might be crazier than I am. [door opens] Jake? How the hell are you? Boys, put your guns away, will you? We're respectable members of the community now. So you're here to see Cole, huh? Why else would I be here? All right. Get inside. [knocking on door] Yeah? Jake Struthers is here to see you. [sighs] Send him in. [door creaks open] Jake, good to see you. Bringing me news of your brother? No news at the present time. I sure hope you're not here to ask for more money. That is precisely why I'm here. Been kind of a dry spell. I figured the last batch I gave you would've lasted longer. I see you pissed it all away again on whiskey and whores. You know, I like you, Jake. You're colorful. You come here and you put your feet up on my desk, and you make yourself at home with nothing more to offer me than, "I want more money." You know, I pride myself on being a good judge of character, so I ask myself, "Why would he do that when he knows that I'd cut his throat from ear to ear without a second thought?" [muffled groan] That's exactly what you want, isn't it Jake? You want me to kill you and end your miserable life because you don't have the balls to do it yourself. You see? I like cowards, Jake. They're predictable. You're predictable. [soft chuckle] [grunting, groaning] [Cole] Now look at me. You come back to me again, and you won't walk out of here. You understand me? [coughing] - Get up! - [groans] Hell, Cole, maybe I'll go buy a gold mine and become a millionaire just like you. And maybe the people of this town need to find out who you really are, Mr. Blackwood, brother of a wanted murderer. You won't be able to take a piss in this town, let alone buy another drink. So you enjoy it while you can. Get him the hell out of here. [man 1] Whoa, whoa! [man 2] Watch it! Watch it! [man whistles] That son of a bitch just doesn't get it, does he? Want me to kill him? No. Not yet. While his brother's still out there, he can be of use to us. [man] Thank you very much. I'm glad we had this talk. But just so you understand, you have until the winter to make this decision. [man shouting] [men chanting in foreign language] Whoo! [Western music playing] Hyah! [man] What's the problem? [Vance] Name's Vance Edison. I was hired by a man named Cole Roberts from Jackson Ridge to reclaim this here mine. He rightfully owns it now. [man] This land belongs to the Struthers family! [Vance] I don't think you're understanding me. - [man] You son of a bitch! - I'll give you ten seconds to gather your things and start saddling your horses. Maybe we should go see the sheriff now. We ain't going nowhere till this son of a bitch gets off my land! [bird screeching] You're a hard man to catch, Jesse Struthers. [Virgil] Jesse! [gunfire, Vance grunts] [horse whinnies] [horse galloping] [sputtering] [grunting, panting] [grunts] [pounding on door] [panting] What do you want? Help me. Please. Martha! Martha! Fetch me some hot water and bring me my tools. Now, damn it! All we've got's some moonshine. I'll tell you the truth, I'm a little liquored up myself. Here. Have some of this. It'll help with the pain. [sputters] [grunts] Don't waste it. That's good moonshine. [yells] Kills the germs. I ought to tell you, it's been awhile since I practiced. Get on with it. [slicing, groaning] Get in there! [groaning] [whimpering] [chuckles] I got it. Shh. What of your eye? Buzzards. Must've been real hungry. I could stitch it, but it's gonna hurt some. [grunts] [slicing, yelling] [bellows] [men grunting] Each Friday, we take a week's worth of gold and deliver it to the assay office for a favorable return. From there, my men split the money two ways, and escort your share to you and mine back to me. I'm certainly amazed at the loyalty of your men, Cole. I just can't fathom it. [chuckles] It's not loyalty. You see that? That man was heard entertaining the idea of pinching a little for himself. My foreman caught wind of it and nipped it. If all is as you say it is, this could take our relationship to a whole new level. Glad to hear it. Well, I must be going. I have a meeting with my constituents Sir... [whispers indistinctly] Yes. [clears throat] Do you know a man by the name of Eli Thomas? Can't say that I do. Eli has this ridiculous notion of running against me for governor. What do you want me to do about it? Well, I was hoping you could, uh, make him... rethink the idea. I'll take care of it. But I need you to do something for me first. What? I need you to vouch for me. For what? Mayor of Jackson Ridge. [chuckles] [clears throat] We can do business together privately, but do not think for a second that my reputation can be bought. This town deserves better than you. [horse whinnies, gallops] [grunting softly] It's good to see you awake, stranger. We didn't know if you were gonna make it or not. How long was I out for? Day or two. [panting, groaning] Oh, you know, sorry about this. We just couldn't risk you ripping out them stitches and losing any more blood. Oh. You know? I... [panting] I need a mirror. You best wait awhile 'til the swelling settles. I want to see it now. [grunts] [gasping] What the hell did you do to my face? That's the best I could do under the circumstances. You're lucky to be alive. No... ...you are. [gasps] Thank you for meeting with us. [translating] Well, I don't know how you deal with this heat. I'm from back east myself. It's always a little bit cooler. All the time I've spent out here, I've never been able to get used to this climate. [speaking native language] He say, "What you want?" I have orders to clear this land. Now, there are two ways we can go about that. The first is to relocate you to someplace suitable and give you a large sum of money. Now, that's the way I'd like to do it. The alternative is to forcibly remove you from this land and give you nothing. Now, I don't want to have to do that, but if you give me no choice... I'll leave it up to you. [man translating] Where the hell do you think you're going? First platoon, post! [shouting] [echoing shouts] [echoing shouts] [wagon approaching] Eli Thomas? Can I help you? Got a message for you. That you should withdraw from running for governor. [chuckles] Is that so? So. Get out of my way. Accidents can happen, Eli. Who the hell do you think you are? You gonna shoot me? Go ahead. I ain't afraid of you. And I sure as hell ain't afraid of that Donald Deets. He comes down here in his fancy suits trying to scare me off. My family's been on this land far too long to be intimidated by the likes of you. You tell your boss that I ain't running, seeing that he's bribed off every last one of my investors. But if I had the money, oh, I would run and I would win. He can be sure of that. Hyah! Hyah! [piano playing] [man talks indistinctly, woman giggling] [woman gasps] There ain't no free pokes. There ain't no free gropes. There ain't no free nothing in my saloon. You want to taste this, you pay Eddie and you take it upstairs. Yes, ma'am. Ah, my English rose. You are the best part of my week. [knocking on door] [English accent] You've got the wrong room. [door opens] Did you hear me? I said get out! My God. I thought you were dead. Yeah, I should be, but I'm not. - I need to find Jake. - Jake? Why would you ever want to speak to him after what he did to you? Jake was never one for courage. And leaving me for dead, well, that's something I won't forget. But I need his help to go after Cole. [exasperated sigh] I can't be the one to tell you this. - Tell me what? - [sighs] Sissy, I don't have time for this. Tell me. Jake was working for Cole the whole time. He set you up. He made a deal with Cole in exchange for you. Ah, damn him. Where do I find Cole Roberts? That is just asking for trouble that you don't need. Jesse... don't do anything stupid. Stupid's the only thing I got left. [pickaxes clanging, indistinct chatter] [man] See you later, Guthrie, you asshole! [men chattering] [men laughing] Hey, Guthrie. What? Hey, the boss wants to see you. Who the hell are you? I was just brought on. Hey, uh, water break? I'm all right. [grunts] Son of a bitch! [men chattering] Go ahead. Go ahead. Yeah, exactly. [laughs] - Hey, I'll show you. - It's all you. Give me that damn knife. You got to know your knife. Feel the balance of the blade. Know how many revolutions it's gonna take to stick your target. - Virgil... - Enough! If you do decide to pull a knife, you better know how to use it. You got to know your kill shots. Here, here, here. I want you to take this knife, and I want to see you practicing with it all day. You hear me? Yes, sir. 'Cause I might not be around to watch your back. [horse galloping] [soft grunting] I'll be damned. Jesse Struthers. It's a pleasure to finally meet you in the flesh. You earned that cut, son. I can't afford to have you blow up my mine. Cole Roberts. You're lucky there's bars between us, you murdering son of a bitch. If I'm not mistaken, I think there's a warrant out for your arrest on those charges, boy. I ain't afraid of you. You think you got this town in your pocket, but you don't. There's only so many times you can push a man down before he fights back, and when that day happens, I hope I'm there to watch you suffer. [laughs] They're gonna hang you first thing in the morning. I just wanted to stop by so you could see the man who took everything from you before you dangle on the end of a rope tomorrow. I swear to you, you will pay for the murder of my family, whether it be in this life or the next! You sleep good now. Oh, that's right. I forgot. You're an Indian-lover now. I tell you what, I'm gonna sleep with one eye open... just in case. [laughing] - [folk music playing] - [chattering] There's your 50. And there's another hundred. Too rich for my blood. I'm out. Never understood the phrase "Too rich for my blood." What does it mean? Does my blood have a value? Is it any more expensive than, say, yours? What the hell you going on about, mister? You're more drunk than me. On the contrary. I'm having what I call a moment of clarity. And the name is Benjamin Brown. I don't really care what your name is. Are you in or you out? My, my. Straight to the point. Do you mind if I impart a piece of knowledge to you? Well, it is a free country. The cards you hold in your hands are inconsequential in a game of poker. Why, that's some impressive advice, Benjamin. [men snicker] Well, then, let not another minute go by. Do show us that marvelous hand. Uh, don't be so presumptuous. You haven't seen my cards yet. As I was trying to tell you, it's no use being enamored with a beautiful young woman, unless you are absolutely certain she's the most ravishing creature in the room. Full house. You cheated. I'm bewildered by the vulgarity of your comment. One should always play fairly, especially when one has the winning hand. Play fairly my ass! There's no way you could've got that hand. I can take many things in this world, but what I cannot accept is an assassination of my character. I leave it up to you. Just the man I'm looking for. - What? - You haven't heard? They the caught the vigilante Jesse Struthers this afternoon. What the hell are you talking about? He tried to blow up my mine. My foreman caught him and knocked his ass clean out. He hangs in the morning. What's the matter, Jake? Cat got your tongue? [laughing] I've got eyes on him all night, Mr. Blackwood. Don't even think about it. - Do you mind? - Please. You're new in town. How about a friendly game of poker? Is that what we are? Friends? You have at it. Would you mind? Not at all. - Where are you from? - Back east. Oh, a city boy. What the hell you doing all the way out here? You know, adventure. Hmm. No limit. Fine by me. [man] What can I do for you, Jake? Wondering if I could have a word with the prisoner. What's your business with him? It's personal. Best said between us. Go on and put your pistol on the table. You have five minutes. And no funny business. Oh, my. Must be my lucky day. Friend, you have a look on your face as if you've already won. [coughs] $2,000. You are feeling quite lucky tonight, aren't you? Very well, then. I'll see your 2,000. Four kings. What cards do you have? I think you exactly what my cards are. Think I'm gonna have to call it a night. What, so soon? Let me give you a chance to win your money back. I'm afraid not. One must have rules to live by in life, otherwise what's to separate you from the common animal? Jesse. I don't suppose sorry will cut it this time. I just thought you being my brother and all, you'd be able to... forgive me. You asked to speak to the prisoner, not your brother. You ain't sorry. You just want me to tell you that everything's okay between us. But it's not, and it never will be. You're a drunk. And a coward. And not worthy of the name "brother." I'm done here! - [piano playing] - [chattering] Give me this week's take. You thieving bastard. Come in here each week and steal my money. Is there a problem here? There's been a problem ever since you arrived in this town. - Careful. - I'm done paying you. [chatter continues] All you people... [chatter stops] ...you never understand why you pay me. [gasps] Who's to stop someone, anyone, coming in here and doing this? [breathing heavily] You know what stops them? Me! You pay me my money or suffer the consequences. [yells] You're a smart broad. That's why we keep you around. Are you all right? I'm fine, thank you. I detest physical violence against women. It's the lowest form of humanity there is. I'm fine, really. I just need a moment to fix myself up and we can get to know each other better. I think you misunderstand me. I don't wish to misrepresent myself, but I believe you know Jake and Jesse Struthers. We're done here. [piano continues] [crowd clamoring] Jesse Struthers, you have been sentenced to death on multiple counts of murder. [crowd murmuring] At this place and upon this day, the 18th day of September, the year of our Lord, 1869, we hereby carry out that sentence. [cheers and applause] You will hang from this rope... ...until you are dead. [cheering] In accordance with the laws set forth, do you have any final words? I do. So speak them now or forever hold your peace. The law has told you a version of who they think I am. But I want you all to know that I am not those things. I'm a good man. My father was a good man before he was murdered. But I guess being a good man just ain't enough. I'm proud of who I am and what I've become. Before I hang, I want everybody here to know one thing... that that man right there killed my family and set me up as the murderer. He's the worst kind of sc... What's the hold up here? We come to see a hanging. - Get a move on. - [crowd cheering] - [choking] - [cheers and applause] [scattered jeering] [woman] You brought it on yourself, boy! - [woman shrieks] - [man gasps] [groans, coughing] I don't think we're gonna see a hanging today, - are we, Sheriff? - What the hell is he doing? Take off his shackles. Jake, have you lost your goddamn mind? Let him go or I'll kill you. - Take them off! - [Sheriff] Unshackle him. Do it! [Jake] Jesse? Go grab some horses. He's an outlaw, Sheriff! You gonna let him get away like that? [groans] You're gonna hang for this, Jake. [chuckles] You're coming with us. [murmuring] [Jake] Jesse. Go on. Get a head start. Don't just stand there! - Hyah! - [woman] He's getting away! Get off! - Hyah! - [gunfire] - Go after him! - [woman screams] [men shouting] Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah, hyah! Hyah, hyah! Hyah, hyah! Hyah, hyah! Hyah, hyah! Hyah, hyah, hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! [neighs, whinnies] Up there! Pick off as many as you can before they set up a defensive. I can do that. Kill as many as you can. Well, where you going? I'll finish the rest. [whinnies] Hyah! [screams] Get to cover! [gunshot] [gunfire echoes] [grunts] Oh! [horses whinnying] Hold your horses! Get behind the rocks and flank 'em! [bullets ricocheting] Where the fuck is he? [grunts] [gunfire continues] - [gunshot] - Ahh! Go to hell. Not just yet. I'm sending you back to Cole as a message. Ah, this must be your lucky day. I'd rather use you as target practice. Fuck you, Jake! [groans] You tell Cole we're coming for him, you hear? - [grunts] - [horse neighs] Hyah! The hell happened to you? You're different. What did they do to you? In all of our years I've never seen you kill another living thing. There are three dead men down there slaughtered in a way I've never seen. You didn't even flinch. You may have saved my life today from hanging, but don't think for one second that changes anything between us. You may hate me for what I did, but if we don't stick together, we're dead. Hey! I'm talking to you! [grunts] - [cries out] - [grunts] [both grunting] [panting] Jeez! [chuckling] [both grunting] [yells] [coughs] [groans] This horse sure seen a lot of riding, Mister. Don't know if she could have lasted much more. Well, you take care of her for me. Why so many people around? There's big reward out for two brothers. Seems to have brought every bounty hunter into town. $5,000 a piece. What happened to your face, Mister? Why? Is something wrong with it? So I head on over, based on a tip. But them Macready boys? Shacked up with some fat whore over in Silver City. Then I walk in and I'll be damned if both of those boys weren't there, stark naked, caught dead in the act. Which one of 'em? She was doin' both of 'em at the same time. - So what'd you do? - Shot fat-ass Ned as he tried to run out the back door. Darryl, he pulled the pistol so I disarmed him with my whip and I shot him in the head. Now, how the hell did you stop a bullet with a whip? Would you like me to show you? I've got this shiny gold coin. I'll bet you that I can grab that gun out of your hand before you can get off a shot. Now, Mister, I ain't looking for no trouble. I just came here for a reward. [chuckles] That's a smart move, friend. Have a drink on me. Joe, get him a bottle. - [whip cracking] - [laughter] Looks like the drink's on you. [laughter] [grunting] Well, where was I? My pack mule and fat-ass Ned. Whiskey. Hey, Mister, didn't you read the sign? No one-eyed retards allowed. [laughter] I just realized I have no money to pay for my drink. I sure could use a shiny gold coin about now. - [whip cracking] - [gunshot] [groans] [Man] I've never seen that before in my life. I'm looking for a man named Cole Roberts. Anyone know where I can find him? [gasps] He's in the building over there. You remember the first time we met? You were just a boy all covered in shit. I don't think you'd eaten for days. But, you had it. The thing that separates us from them. Murderous rage. From that moment on, I knew you were mine. Those people out there... they don't get us. They don't get where we came from. You think anybody who has power, I mean, real power, is like them? I don't think so. Where are you headed with this? Politics. The presidency. Hell, the whole world. I want it all. I need you by my side, Billy. You're the only one I trust. I, uh... never knew my father. [Vance] Cole Roberts! Cole Roberts! Son of a bitch. That's Vance Edison. [Vance] Show yourself and I won't kill all your men! Oh, shit. Vance, good to see ya. Hell, I thought you were dead. I was. I've been reborn. Where's Charlie? Charlie's dead. The rumor is you murdered him. I just wanted to hear it from you first before I kill you. Whoever told you that sold you down the river. I didn't kill Charlie. Jesse Struthers did. You expect me to believe that boy killed Charlie? That boy took out four of my men. Hell, he killed Carlos VanPelt in a knife fight. Vance, why would I kill Charlie? It makes no sense. It doesn't need to make any sense for you. Find out for yourself. You see if I'm lying. You bring me that outlaw Jesse Struthers and there's a $5,000 reward in it for ya. All right, then. But if I find out you're lying, I'm coming back, and I will kill you. Son of a bitch! Follow him. And when he finds them, and he will find them, you shoot them all dead, you got me? Can I go with him, boss? Shut the hell up and fetch me a drink. Billy, be smart. You understand? Do it. [horse whinnies] What are you doing here? Well, I know you're been coming here every Sunday for the past six months. I want to talk to you... I've got nothing to say to you. Get out of here. You're not welcome. I know you don't have any family here. - Who is that? - It has nothing do with you. Hey, don't walk away. She's not yours. Then who's is she? It's just a part of the job. - Sissy... - Don't you touch me! What do you want me to say? I don't even know what I did, goddamn it! You were the one who wouldn't talk to me. I came to you begging for mercy and you just kicked me out! Don't you turn this around on me. You weren't there! - For what? - For me! For Jesse! You sold your own brother out! What sort of man does that? Why did you come here? I need your help. I may have found a way to get out of this and we can't do it without you. I mean, Jesse needs you. I need you. Fine. But I'm not doing it for you. It's good to see you took my advice. Oh, we got company. - I'll be damn. - You know this guy? Damn right, I do. Well, how the hell did he find us out here? Please, don't shoot. Sissy. What? You know this guy? We talked a few nights ago. What do you mean, you talked? I mean exactly what I said. We talked. I followed the lady out here. She had no idea of my whereabouts. Who are you and what do you want with us, Mister? The name's Benjamin Brown, and I wish to offer my services to you. He's a card cheat and a liar. I bet you you're working for Cole. I can assure you I'm not working for Cole Roberts. And I did not cheat you at cards. You're simply a poor player, Jacob. Contrary to your brother's feelings towards me, my actions here are purely noble. Why do you wanna help us? Frankly, I find Cole Roberts to be a distasteful creature, and I wish for him to be taught a lesson. Bullshit. He took you for over $2,000 and you want payback. I don't deny that's part of it. Cole Roberts is a very dangerous man and you did by standing up to him, that's never been done before. You have an opportunity to put him away for a very long time. But if you're to face Cole and his men, you'll need more than the three of you, that's a fact. I've seen corruption and greed firsthand. I know what it does. And our reasons may not be the same, but the end result is... to take down Cole Roberts and what he stands for once and for all. Jake, take his pistol. Bad idea. Maybe. We need all the help we can get. How can I help? All right, then. Here's what we got so far. Cole does business with a silent partner. His name is Donald Deets. Deets? Donald Deets? He's harmless. - You know him? - He's a regular. Yeah, well, he's the reason Cole was able to legally seize our dad's mine. The plan is to ambush Deets' money and make Cole out to be the double-crosser. So, make him think that he's not giving him his share. [Jesse] Much better than that. What's the one thing a politician wants more than anything? - Power. - That's right. We're gonna give Deets a little competition for governor bought and paid for by Cole Roberts himself. Even if we're able to do as you say, how do you know Deets will do business with you? I don't. But if we all offer him the same split he has with Cole, I'm guessing he would rather do business with people like us over a known ruffian like Cole Roberts. Who's in? All right. Let's do this. [Tense music] [Deets] You all know me. I'm one of you! And you know that I will represent you! Thank you for coming out here today! Now, don't forget to vote! - [applause] - [crowd murmuring] - All right, all right. - What a nice man! Excuse me, Mr. Deets, sir. Do you mind if we ask a few questions? Oh! Come on in, gentlemen. I always have time for my friends in the press. How do you feel about Eli Thomas' late bid for governor? What are you talking about? That son of a bitch! Can I quote you on that? No! You may not. My response is that I welcome the competition. The good people deserve that, and I am confident that I will be your next governor. And that... you can quote me on. Something must be done about this son of a bitch Eli Thomas. I sent my men to take care of... Clearly, they did an outstanding job. Give it a few weeks, then take care of it. I don't want anyone to know I had anything to do with it. I don't like competition, Cole. It's unhealthy for the soul. I'll make it look like an accident. And when do I receive my payment for this week? Your payment was sent over two days ago. Well, it never came! - Do not fuck with me, Cole! - I'm not. I provide power and protection from the law so that you can do the groundwork. If you are not capable of such a simple task, I will look to someone who is. I'll take care of it, Donald. I want my goddamn money. If I have to pay you myself, you'll get it. You're slipping, Cole. - Kenny! - Yes, boss? Where the hell is Steve Aguilar? I don't know. I haven't seen him. What's that kid's name? - Joe something. - Joe Stanford? Get him to find him and bring him to me. - Now! - Yes, boss. [ horse whinnies ] What have you got to show me? - What do you want for them? - Three piece gold. Three pieces of gold! Trying to cheat an old man. - I'll give you one piece. - Three piece. Goddamn savages. Fine! You can come out now, mister. Easy now. He don't mean no harm. Ain't that right? He just wants to ask you some questions about that white man you told me about. [speaking native language] Hello, Governor. I'm so happy you stopped by. Patience, my dear. I've got a surprise for you. - Ah! - I'll be right back. Are you ready for your surprise? Oh, I'm ready. Here it is. [laughs] What the hell is going on? Mr. Deets, we mean you no harm. We have some information I think you really need to hear about. I'm done here. Cole Roberts is paying for Eli Thomas' election. He wants him to win. He struck a better deal with him and he's pulling money from the mine to fund it. I don't know what you're talking about. We can prove it. How? We'll show you. And how did you come about this information? I used to work for Cole. What do you want from me? We want our names clear and our land back. You should know that land is making me extremely rich. Why would I do anything to change that? We'll pay you the same share Cole is paying you. I'll give you my entire share in exchange for one favor. What kind of favor? Do you have anything to do with the relocation of Indians? I might have something to do with that. Why do you ask? Because I have a personal interest in making sure a certain Apache tribe is unharmed and gets exactly what they're promised. So you're telling me if your Indian friends get exactly what they've been promised, you'll give me your share of the mine? We'll draw up papers and make it official. We just want things to go back to the way they were. Fine, if you can prove what you say is true, I'll have my assistant draft up the legal document. That's fine by me. - Jake? - I suppose so. Mr. Deets, you got yourself a deal. Fine. Now prove it. [knocks] [rustling, bell on door jingles] You're early! [man] I know. Open up. [knocks on door] Dear God. I said you were early. [grunts] [door slams] What do you want? Do you know who I work for? I don't think he believes you're serious. [Jake] Really? How about now? I... [wheezes] I think you're making a terrible mistake. [chuckles] Yeah? It wouldn't be the first time. All right, let's have it your way. - No! - [gun clicks] I believe that last one convinced him. All right then. [grunts] Now, in a few minutes, there are gonna be three men that are gonna come through that door. And when they do, it's business as usual, do you understand? And there's been a slight change of plans. Change of address. I want you to tell them to send the money there. They won't listen to me. [knocking on door, bell on door jingles] Shit. Go hide over there. [man] Hello? Unlock the door. - Don't be a hero. - Hey, open up! If you tip them off, my friend over there will shoot you in the back. - [man] Open this door! - What are you doing? Making sure you do your job. [man] Open this door right now! [pounding on door] If you don't open this goddamn door, - I'm coming. - I'll break it down right now! - I'm coming. - Open this godda... What took so damn long? I'm sorry, I was distracted with work. Check and see if there's anyone else in here. There's no one else in here. Can we dispense with the paranoia and conduct business? All right. Let's conduct some business then. Two pounds and 11 ounces. Exactly as I expected. - Let's go. - [grunts] Oh, uh, before I forget, uh, Cole sent me a telegram with a new address for where you were to drop off the money at. What the hell you talking about? He never said nothing about no change in address. Yeah, well, that's why he sent the telegram. Give me that address. Well, the pleasure was all mine. They're gone. Let's go. You're sure there were two sets of tracks? Yes, sir. One of them shot Steve Aguilar in the head. Buried him out there. I bet it was Jake. I should've killed that little shit when I had a chance. Why would they go after the money? They're trying to lure me out. Lure you out for what, Cole? I don't know. They're planning something with that money. But what? You sure this is the right place? Yeah? Mister... Thomas? Yeah. I have a package for you. Wasn't expecting it so soon. Well, this money is for Mr. Deets, right? Son, this is all for Mr. Deets. Make sure you tell our friend thank you. Very much. How's that for partnership? You'll have your land back before the end of the week. [weakly] Help me. Help me. Please. Help me, please! [gasps] [horse whinnying, people chattering] [speaking native language] [Jake] The look on Ed's face when I told him that there weren't any bullets in the chamber. [laughs] He... He peed his pants, did he not? [laughs] Yeah, he did. He did, Jesse. He peed himself. I wish you could've seen the look on Deets' face when he found out he'd been betrayed. He nearly popped a blood vessel in his head. [rumbling in distance] [horse whinnies] Whoa, easy now. What the hell is that? [animals hooting and chittering] Time to draw, gentlemen. [guns cocking] [grunts] [horse neighs, Jake grunts] [Jake] Jesse! [Jesse groaning] Jesse? Jesse! Jesse! You okay? Yeah, yeah, it's just a graze. Where's my pistol? Where's my goddamn pistol? [Jake] No! [grunts] What the hell was that? [whimpering] - He needs a doctor. - [groans] Jesse, he's after you, not us. You have to go! You have to go, now! [grunting] [horse neighs in distance] [galloping] [panting, groaning] [sniffing] Hyah! - [grunting] - [sizzling] [panting, whimpering] [fire crackling] [sniffing] Jesse Struthers! I know you're here! I can smell your burning flesh. Mister, I don't know who the hell you are! Don't matter! You stole my goddamn mare. I'm gonna bury you alive for that. I enjoyed killing your father. The look on his face was worth it. Ha! Hyah! [grunts] [groaning] [chanting in native language] [chanting continues] [cries] [Cole] Kill him. Am I dreaming? I am so proud of you, my son. But it's time to get up. It's time to finish what you have started. Water. It's not your time. It's time to go. Remember, I will always be with you. [grunts] [gunshot, bullet ricochets] Shit. Hey, Vance! It's me, Billy Walters! Cole sent me here to help you. [gunshot] I'm sorry. I didn't mean to hit... hit you. It was an accident. [gunshot] Goddamn it! Oh! Oh! Vance... [coughs] Vance. I didn't mean to shoot you. You got to believe me. I meant to hit Struthers. Well, you didn't. [weakly] Mama? [angrily] Who is it? [Sissy] It's me! Sissy! What the hell is going on here? Please, I need your help. No, Sissy, you tell me what is going on here. He's gonna die unless we do something! I'll get the doctor. I'll boil water for the doctor. Don't you die on me, Jacob Struthers. I can't live my life without you. I don't want to. He's fine. A few more hours, there wouldn't have been nothing I could've done. Can I see him now? I don't think that's a good idea. But I can tell that's not gonna stop you, so make it quick. He's very tired. [labored breathing] - [shudders] - Shh! Don't say a word. [sniffs] It wasn't supposed to be like this. I was finished with you. I... What did you say? I love you. [chuckles weakly] [sniffling] I love you, too. Jesse? We don't know where he is. [sniffs] He's a survivor. He'll be fine. [man shouts in native language] [speaking native language] [country folk music playing in distance] [laughter, chattering] [muttering] What the hell is that? What the hell is that? Is that who that looks like? Yeah, that's Jesse Struthers. - I'll be goddamned. - Let's get him up. [grunting] Goddamn, he's a heavy son of a bitch. Get his ass to the sheriff. Yep. Get him up. Look what just showed up. Go get Doc Stevens. You hang in there. I know what's been going on. I'm on your side. [knocking on door] I thought you'd like to know they found Jesse. He's all right, he's with the doc now. Oh. Wonderful news. Where are you going? I have some business to take care of. I'll be back shortly. [door closes] [distant chattering] Howdy, Marshall. Release the prisoner. I'd be happy to. But on whose authority? On mine. I'm arresting Cole Roberts on three counts of murder, larceny and an attempt to defraud the state. So I suggest you take these men and you go arrest him now before he slips through your fingers, Sheriff. Yes, sir. Come with me. Cole Roberts? You're under arrest. Come on out with your hands up. I'm out here with three U.S. Marshalls. If you do not come on out, we will be forced to come on in. Break that door down. He knew we were coming. The hell you have to say for this, Sheriff? [Cole] Three little mice run down a hole, get stuck. First mouse, he... he starts to panic, squirm, trying to find a way out. But there ain't none. Second mouse, he can't believe he was stupid enough to fall into the trap. So he just... withers away. The third mouse, the final mouse... he kills the other two, and eats them. Couple weeks later, the trap opens up and he walks out alive. I never would've guessed that'd be you. I feel like a traitor. [chuckles] What's next? Now? Now I set a trap of my own. They're smarter than you think. [muffled crying] - [grunts] - [groaning] We'll just have to see about that, won't we? [grunts] Hey. [panting] How do I look? It's an improvement. [chuckles] Yeah. I'm just glad you made it back. Well, I'd be dead if it weren't for you. You saved my life. Don't mention it. God damn it, Jake. [sighs] Why? Why in the hell did you do it? You just took a bullet for me without a second thought. But then you go off and make a deal with the devil for my life? Help me to understand it here, 'cause I just don't get it. I don't know. [chuckles] - I just don't know. - I can't accept that. You see, I don't trust you, Jake. Look, I want to. But I just don't know why you do the things you do. Like, ever since we were kids, you went out of your way to hurt me. What are you talking about? Are you serious? How about when you stole my horse, got drunk and lost her on a poker game? - Or what about Laurie? - [exhales] The only girl I ever loved, Jake, and you fucked her to spite me. And worst of all, when I had a knife thrown into my shoulder and you left me to die. Now how could you do it when all I've ever done is love you? All I've ever done is hate you! You were always his favorite! "Oh, Jesse can do no wrong." "Oh, hey, Jake, look at that. Why can't you be more like him?" And what was... what was I, huh? What was I? I was the shit on the bottom of his boot heel! You say everything has a purpose in life. Well, what's the purpose of his fist hitting my face whenever all I did was work just as hard as you? What is the purpose in that, Jesse? [groans] It's because you were his son. I wasn't. What? Roy wasn't my father. Virgil was. He took me in when Virgil couldn't handle it anymore. Roy was... was so hard on you 'cause every time he looked at you, he saw himself. I don't believe you. Why would he do that to me? Why wouldn't he tell me? Why wouldn't he treat me like his own son? I don't know, Jake. Well, that's not good enough! It's not fucking good enough! It's not good enough! It's not good enough! It's not good enough! It's not good enough! Do you hear me? It's not good enough! It's fucking not good enough! Aah! It's not good... [screaming] [knocking on door] Gentlemen. Good to see you up and moving around. Here is the agreement we discussed. - Ready to be signed. - Where's Cole? Someone tipped him off. He'll turn up soon enough, and when he does, I will deal with him. Our deal was Cole was either dead or behind bars. I'm not signing anything until that happens. Very well. I have my people searching the area. Shan't be long. Cole mysteriously slipped away, huh? Gee, I wonder who could've tipped him off. Hey, has anyone seen Benjamin Brown? He saved your life. He just may surprise you. Oh, yeah? Where is he now? Exactly. [men chattering] No hard feelings? No hard feelings. Jake? Sheriff. You tell him what you told me. - I didn't mean no harm. - Tell him! Tell me what? One of my regulars come visit me last night. And after we did our thing, I was getting all ready to go when he hands me a piece of paper, tells me to make sure I give this to Jesse Struthers. And what else did he give you? Go on. All right! I wasn't gonna keep it. Honest I wasn't. It was just so pretty. Just wanted to have it for a little while is all. Please, mister, I didn't mean no harm. [speaking native language] [speaking native language] Jesse. Best give me that letter now. [Cole's voice] What am I gonna do with you? You just don't die. It's such a shame 'cause I got this pretty little Injun here who tells me the strangest thing. She's your wife. Let's make a deal. Her life for yours. Which one dies is up to you. You remember Red Rock Quarry, don't you? Come alone. This ends now. Are you crazy? It's a trap. He's not gonna let either of you out alive. I know that. Well, then why the hell are you going? Let the marshals go after them. Never asked me why I came back. Well, I thought you would tell me when the time was right. Fear. Complete and utter fear. What does that have to do with anything? That day when you left me, I thought I was gonna die. I thought it was the end of my life, and in some ways, I wish it was because I haven't been able to stop thinking about it since. Feels like I've been holding my breath this entire time since Roy was shot. I just want to go back to living, Jake. That's all I ever wanted. But if I don't face this now, I'll never be able to live right again. Even if it costs you your life? Even if it costs me my life. Okay. Then I'm with you. Let's go find this son of a bitch and finish this. No, Jake. I have to go alone. Wait, there... Listen, there are things going on right now that I can't explain to you, but you're gonna have to trust me. Hey... I'm not afraid anymore. I know what I have to do. You stay here with Sissy. You two build a family. Do some good in this world. I'm proud of you. But my journey ends here. The hell with that. Hyah! Hyah! Hyah! - Where are you going? - To get help. - But, Jake, you can't! - He's gonna die if I don't do something. Hyah! Yah! [Jake] We don't have time for this, God damn it. My dear boy, we will make the time. I need you to send an emergency dispatch to Captain Samuel Whitfield, Sixth Calvary. "We've located Cole Roberts, stop. He's at the Red Rock Quarry, stop. Coordinates attached, come at once, use extreme caution." Send that right away! You better ride hard, I ain't waiting for you. I may not look like much, young man, but I can hold my own. Let's go. [panting] [grunts] Listen up! I've got something to say! We found Cole Roberts and his posse. And I'm gonna take him down! But I can't do it alone. I need your help. Everyone of you knows who he is and what he's done! And we have let him get away with it for far too long! [man] Calm down. Now, I am not pointing any fingers here, we are all guilty. Especially me. But this is our chance to take back our town! Now who's with me? Pete... how many times has he come into your saloon with his men and taken whatever the hell he wants? Huh? Lots of times, I suppose. And what did you do about it? I did nothing! Now's your chance to do something about it. Every one of us. Now who's with me? Come on! [crowd murmuring] [Pete] Come on down from there, Jake. I'll buy you a drink. Let's let the authorities take care of it now. I want y'all to remember this day. This moment. When Jake Struthers... the town drunk... the lowlife... the one that you all laughed at behind my back... this is the day that I went after Cole Roberts! When no one else would! [panting] Hyah! Hyah! [speaking native language] [speaks native language] Come in. Leaving us? It's time that I move on. Life with just one man. No sir, that ain't no kind of life for me. Did I ever tell you I was married once? I didn't know that. Not the kind of thing you share in this business. Thought I was in love. Even when he beat me senseless. Finally summoned up the courage to leave that worthless freeloader and I ain't never looked back. Never understood love. Just didn't see the purpose of it. Till seeing you with Jake. Makes you realize there's still a lot of learning to be done in this world. Here. Take this for Jake and the doctor's lodgings. No, you keep it. Thank you. Thank you, Edna. For everything. You're welcome. Now, I don't want to see you back here, not ever again. [sighs] I got you now. [gunshot, horse whinnies] [gunshot reverberating] Well, I guess they know I'm here now. [man] That's far enough! I'm here as promised! Now let my wife go! [Cole] Why would I do that? Because I have something that you want! This is the original deed to the mine. You hear me? No more hiding behind Deets anymore. You let her go, and it's yours! You mean my gold mine. Not anymore. Deets saw to that. Property's been seized by the county! Where did you get that? It was well hidden. Well, well, well. It seems like we both have something the other wants. Show me the paper. Show her to me first. Bring that Injun out. [yelling, grunting] [panting] [speaking native language] [Cole] What's she saying? She says, "How much men you have?" [speaking native language] You want it? It's yours! This ends now! Bring it to me. No. It's not gonna work like that. You give her a fresh horse and some distance. And then I'll do whatever you want. Mm. Howdy, Joe. [grunts] [speaking native language] [breathing heavily] Ah! [men clamoring in slow motion] [grunts, panting] We have to go down there and help him. Not till my men come, we won't. - But they're gonna kill him. - Son, we don't know how many men are down there. We might be walking into a trap and not even know it. Well, that's easy for you to say. He's not your goddamn brother. I left him before, I'm not gonna do it again. Leave him be. [Jesse panting] [grunting] Sign it. Sign it! Good. Very good. You didn't think I was stupid enough to let her go just like that, did you? [groaning, yelling] You son of a bitch! [grunting, groaning] [men laughing] [coughs] [screams] [speaks native language] Let me introduce you to a very old friend of mine. You remember Vance Edison, don't you? How's your neck? [yelling] - [yelling] - [men laughing] Pretty little lady you got there, Struthers. Looks like she loves you a whole lot. I ain't afraid of you. You're gonna be, boy. Believe me, you're gonna be. [crying, yelling] Before I kill you, tell me one thing, what happened to my partner? What are you talking about? [men laughing] [gagging] That was for Billy! [groans] You son of a bitch! [gagging] [laughs] [panting] Now where was I? [screams] [gasps] [grunts] [all clamoring] [gasps] [grunts] Get down, there's too many of them. [laughs] Is that the best you got? I overestimated you, Struthers. I thought you were smarter than that. [crying] [laughing] Hey, Cole, come up here! What the hell is that? [groaning] Holy shit. Gentlemen, shall we? [battle cry] [all yelling] Don't just stand there, go get 'em! [all clamoring] [yelling] [grunts] [yells] [all yelling] [gunfire] [clamoring] [groans] [chokes, grunts] [low growl] [grunting, yelling] [gasping] [neck cracks] Ah! [crying] [both panting] [whispers in native language] [neck breaks] [grunting] [cocks gun] [man cries out] Fight me like a man. Come on! Follow me, boy. [grunting] Ah! [both grunting] [groaning] Come on, boy. [battle cry] [grunting] [both grunting] [groaning] [grunting, yelling] [both grunting] [exclaims] [groaning] [screaming] [grunts] [both grunting] [bellows] Come on! My turn! [coughs] [grunts] [winces in pain] [grunts] [panting] [spits, panting] [bellowing] [yelling] [groans] [coughs] [groaning weakly] Time for you to die, boy. [yells] [groaning] [battle cry] [screams] [grunts] [panting] [laughs] Oh, shit. Yeah. You look good. You should see the other guy. [Jake] I got to ask you, how did he know that you were here? Remember when I said he just may surprise you? You mean you both were in on this the entire time? I had to have him get Cole out of town, and I needed to know exactly where he was so we could go after him. Well, why didn't you tell me? I couldn't risk it. No one knew. I'm sorry, brother. Huh? Huh? Huh? [groans] [coughing laugh] [chuckles] And you! You are a no-good... card-cheating son of a bitch. But you sure got one hell of a poker face. Thank you. You're welcome. [whimpers] Jesse! [crying] [speaks native language] [battle cry] [all joining in] [gunshots, shouting] [laughing] [gunshot, grunts] Help me! Help me! Help me! Help! Help me! Help me! Help me! I'm unarmed! I'm unarmed! Don't shoot me. I'm unarmed! Identify yourself. I'm just a gold miner. I'm out here doing my job. The Apaches, they attacked us. They're killing everyone! Mayor Deets is dead! What is your name? My name? My name... they are killing white folks right now as we speak. All right, Saunders, Mitchell, Wilson, flank left. Ians, Maddox, O'Reilly, flank right. The rest of you come with me. [yelling in native language] [whooping] [gunshots in the distance] [grunts] [whinnies] [gunshots ricochet] [battle cries] [gunshot] [whinnies] [speaking native language] No! No!
