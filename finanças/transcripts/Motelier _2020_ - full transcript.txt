[Upbeat music] Hello. I'm a motelier, Da-hui. How is... your night today? [Music continues] [Sniffs] I'm so drunk. It's not okay to be drunk. [Groans] Fuck, yikes. F... uck? [Sighs] Seok. Are you okay? I'm not okay, damn it. [Loud thud] [Mumbles gibberish] Jerk. Not again. [Signs deeply] [Loud tap] [Groans] If you're going to break up anyway, it's better to do it when you're younger. It did last more than a hundred days this times. The number doesn't mean anything. Here. Cheers. [Glass taps the table] Seok. Yes. Life is short. Don't waste your time reading other's mind and bothering yourselves. Just enjoy your life. That's life. Seok. Let's go home now. I gotta go work tomorrow. Hey, Yuna. What? Can't I love someone? What are you saying? You can love anyone you like. Can't I love someone? I've told you! Why do you keep saying that to me? Anyone I like? This, that, and just... Whatever I like? Then I can love anyone I like? Whatever! Okay, you've said so. I can love someone. It's your own life. You have to create your own sunshine. Don't you think? Did you call me 'sunshine'? No, that's not what I said. No, that's what you've said. You called me 'sunshine'. [Laughs] Hey, sunshine! Stay put. - Goodness. - Sunshine. Good evening. Are you staying for hours? Or for the night? For the night. - 50,000 won, please. - Yes, hold on. Sit still. Where is it? Oh no, taxi... Ms. If you have difficulties paying... Wait. Cash. I have cash. I'll pay all cash for the night. [Ominous music] You haven't changed. Seok, what is it? Do you know her? No. [Music continues] 1 million won has been paid for the night. [Condoms rustle] Don't forget your card. And change your dirty tricks. That's too old, Seok. [Ominous music continues] Seung-jun. Here is a coffee. Thank you, Miss. Well... Are you okay? - My ex? - Yes. He was always a jerk. I'm glad I'm not with him anymore. I'm so proud of myself. That's right. Right? I deserve better. Yes. Let me take an hour break. Okay, there are not many guests around this time. - Let's change a shift in an hour. - Sure. Thank you. [Upbeat music] [Door closes] Hello. I'm a motelier, Da-hui. Have you ever bumped into your ex? I have, today. Actually at the motel, I work. Ah, that bastard. So I was going to tell you a story about my ex. But I've got a better story to tell you today. What do you do when you only have 5-minute left before check-out? [Door-lock clicks] What took you so long? I'm sorry. I forgot my cell phone. Am I too late? We'd better run. You'll die if you're late again. Okay, I'm sorry. Let's go. Da-yeong. Huh? You know I like you. Just to make sure... We'll be late. Let's go. We're late. Aren't you going? No. I didn't mean to rush you. No, we're late. Huh? It's already late. I don't want to run. Let's walk. Okay. You can hold my hands if you want. Okay. I said you can hold my hands if you want. Yes. [Glass clinks] [Pours liquid] [Pours liquid] [Sighs deeply] What took you so long? Well... Are you here for working or drinking? What's wrong with drinking? My boss said the last shift can have an unlimited drink. [Slaps] What do you care? You don't usually care about me. What do you mean I don't care? I don't? Yeah. After we've got into college, you have no interest in me. What are you talking about, Da-yeong? You know my grade. And how hard I tried, to get into the same college with you. Don't you know? Then how come you don't kiss me? Pardon? You know, we go to the same school. And we held our hands. There's gotta be the next move. The next move? Go close the door, hurry. Why? [Fist hits the table] Just close it. I'll be back. Wait. I'm going to close only that door. Da-yeong, you know... I'll be back. [Unlocks the door] [Clears throat] Alright... Do it. Are you sure? Hey, the only time you needed my permission was when you asked me for our first date. "Mother-in-law to be" [Makes a suprised noise] Oh no. What's wrong? Da-yeong. Da-yeong, are you alright? Oh wait. "Mother-in-law to be" [Clears throat] Well... Huh? You know... Are you sure your parents are not coming home today? Yes. They go on a trip every wedding anniversary. Every year they do. I'm sure they're not coming home today. 100% sure? Yes. [Quiet music] They're not home today. Not even once. They didn't miss the trip. [Music continues] [Doorbell rings] Hyeon-tae, it's Da-yeong's mom. Can you open the door? Mom? Hyeon-tae, I thought he's home today. What the hell? Did you tell your mom you're here? Are you crazy? I told her I'm doing assignment at Hana's tonight. What is he doing? Oh no, what should we do? Go get the door. Where? No, I can't. Are you busy? Oh no, I don't know. Just go, you jerk! Hold on. Wait. Where am I? Wait... Hold on a second! Okay, I'm ready. I'm good. What is this? You, go there. All set? Okay, okay. Shit. [Laughs] - Hello. - You are so slow. Hyeon-tae, how have you been? Good. You still look like a teenager. [Da-yeong's mom laughs] [Hyeon-tae laughs nervously] What brought you here? Oh, do you have kimchi? Kimchi... Hyeon-tae, can I come in? Sure. Why are you wearing your shirt backward? Odd. Oh no. Why is it like this? I must've put it wrong. [Taps the container] By the way, how are things going with you and Da-yeong? Yes, we're in a healthy relationship. Well, maybe because she's my daughter. I'm not sure why you like her. I like her everything. That jerk. - Hyeon-tae. - Yes. When women ask you something, they want to hear the details. I know you like her. Got it. I'll fix it. [Bursts out laughing] That's too much. I was just kidding. [Laughs] [Laughs along nervously] Oh, you're kidding. Hyeon-tae. - Can I use the bathroom? - Yes, over there. My stomach... [Makes startles noises] - I'm sorry! - What's wrong? You can't use the bathroom! I got to go. Oh no. I need to go right now. This bathroom... I'm sorry. I'll use it like no one uses it. I'm a neat person. I know you are. But you can't use it now. - Hey, please. - That's not the problem. You know, the toilet...! It's clogged. [Toilet cover clinks] Then unclog it. Do you have a plunger? I'll do it for you. No, wait! Wait! - What? - Yes, you can unclog it. I know, I know. I've tried and... And what? Oh my... What happened? I've tried... The toilet... It is exploded. Like 'Boom'. [Whines] It was dripping, pouring, and exploding! That's not a toilet anymore. I'm sorry but... That room is shit. It's full of shit literally. Is it so? This is humiliating. [Closes door] It's exhausting. "Motel" What did you get? Something to drink. Ah, a condom? [Chokes] Huh? - Can you see? - Yes. Let's go. Put your hat right. Okay. Da-yeong, is this really necessary? What if we bump into someone? But it's not bad to go to a motel. Of course it's not. It's actually a good thing. And you think this is still necessary? Do you want to fail again? No. Is that grape or strawberry flavor? Grape, strawberry... What do you mean? Oh you meant drink, right? Wow. Wow, this is legit. The bed is so big. So comfy. [Makes excited noises] - Awesome. - I love it. What is this? Whoa! Wow, it's so soft and comfy. Hey, there is TV. Yes. It's so nice. [Porn actors make noises] Turn it off. Turn it off. Now! Alright. This must be a refrigerator. - Refrigerator? - Water and other beverages. Do you want some? "Enjoy and be healthy" [Silence] Isn't it too hot? Should I turn the air conditioner on? Yes. Is this too dark? No. It's perfect. [Soft music] [Drops the remote controller] [Music continues] [Phone rings] [Phone keeps ringing] Sir, you have 5 minute before check-out. Da-yeong. Yes. Let's do it. I told you don't need my permission to ask. [Music continues] Miss, isn't it check-out time for room 601? They extended. They're going to stay over. Then the payment will be made when they check out? I'll pay for the additional cost. Pardon? No more questions. Yes. [Clears throat] Did you eat something? [Clears throat again nervously] Mister. [Playful music] [Door locks] Nice, it's so refreshing. I thought it's a team get-together. Where is everybody? They said they'd come. Because you and I are only single. Hey. Drink it up. For what? It's a penalty shot. It's a penalty shot for... for being single. Hey, then you should drink, too. Nope, I don't. Then I ain't gonna drink. That sounds informal. - Oh... - So... Drink it up. It wasn't informal... Alright. [Glass clinks] [Playful music] What are you doing? Huh? Wipe yourself. Ah... Yes. Speaking of the tissue, one story just came to my head. Do you know the tissue cover story? The tissue cover? It's about a male guest we had during the day. In his 30s and he was on a business trip. He was from another town. [Laughs] [Moans] Yes, sir. The meeting went well. And they want to sign the contract next week. It's all thanks to you. Thank you. Yes! Really? Of course, of course! Thank you. Take care! Yes! [Makes excited noises] Good. [Moans] [Groans] [Phone rings] Hey, Ji-yeon. I'm eating lunch after the meeting. You're eating late, you must have been hungry. It's okay. - Ji-yeon. - Yeah? - I won the contract! - Really? Congratulations! You worked so hard for it. I know. I was so stressed out about having come all the way to Seoul and going back with no outcome - but it worked out so well. - Yeah! You should celebrate the day. Yeah, of course! Well, the company said I could take tomorrow off, so I was just thinking for a moment that maybe I could stay the night here. Of course! Have a drink and stay the night at a nearby motel. Is it okay? Yeah! Don't drink too much and just tell me where you're staying. Okay. Of course, I'll do that. Don't drink too much, and congratulations! You're the best! Yeah, thank you. I'll call you later. - Yeah, call me. - Okay! Excuse me, can I have a soju? And some pork slices? [Laughs] [Screams in excitement] I did it! Did it! I did it. I did it. I did it. [TV turns on] [Laughs] [People on TV laugh] Visiting massage service? Available 24H, for both men and women. No illicit sexual services? Why would they say no illicit? It doesn't mean that they'd reject my innocent request, but why would they mention and write that in bold and intrigue my curiosity? No. No. No. Well, asking doesn't hurt. Let's just call. I have the right to ask as a consumer, don't I? Just ask. What? Ask. Okay, the number is 588 2822. Quickly...? Mister, quickly? Okay! [Slaps] Hello? Yes, I'd like to make a reservation for a massage. Yes, for one? Yes. Which type? Type...? Oh well,... I haven't thought about it. But I... I'm sort of sensitive. We only have aroma oil and dry. What would you like? Aroma... dry? - I don't care. - Okay, in 10 minutes. 10 minutes... okay. Thank you. Thank you. Dry aroma, dry aroma. I don't care, whatever! I don't care, whatever. Good health and good taste. Massage. Massage. Who the hell is this? This is an important moment. Massage, massage, massage. Seriously! [Phone rings] "My dear Ji-yeon" Damn, I'm screwed. [Phone keeps ringing] Hey, Ji-yeon. I'm sorry. I was in the shower. What's your room number? Why? What's your room number? I'm your number 1 forever. Room number. 307. I'm resting well, why? Oh, 307. Okay. Honey, do you know where I am? Where? I'm on my way to see you! Surprise! I'll be there in 20-30 minutes. I took a half-day off to celebrate with you. Are you happy? Yeah? Yeah? [Screams] So excited to be with you at the motel. I'll be there soon. Take your time! Be safe. Take your time! Okay. I'm screwed. Number, number, number, number, hurry. It's in your call history, stupid! - Hello. - This is room 307, I just called. - Yeah? - I'm sorry but I want to cancel. - Cancel? - Yes, cancel. Sorry, that's not possible. Why? Hold on. Damn you, shit! They're coming in a group! Shit, where are you? Damn, kill them all properly. This son of a bitch. Damn it, you bastard! Go to hell, bastard. What? Damn it, I got blood on me. Mother will be so upset. Sorry, what did you say? - Yeah? - You want to cancel? No, I wanted to ask you where you were... - Yeah, just wait. - Yes. Take your time. Thank you, sir. Thank you! Okay! I'm scared. This mosquito! Piss off, bastards! What the heck! What do I do, what do I do? What do I do? I haven't been to a motel in such a long while. We used to come so often when we first dated. We had a blast. I feel good today. So good. My dear. Honey. Who are they? Are you not on a business trip alone? No, these are... I mean they're not here for work. Mister, I'm here for work. What the hell are you talking about? Yeah, yeah, we're here for business. Yeah, yeah, they're here for business. Are you here for work too? What the heck are you saying? [Relaxing music] So good. I didn't know you would have prepared this for me. I called a massage service when I heard you were coming. So relaxing. Yeah. I like it. You like it? Huh? Do you like it like crazy? No. This is just crazy. Don't do that. Honey. We haven't been to a motel for so long, right? Yeah. We used to come here so often when we first dated. Yeah. Money didn't matter at that time. If we had saved the money, we could have just rented an apartment. Yeah! We were so hot... Yes, I like it hot. Oh. What! What are you doing? So hot. I'm a bit hot. Then don't do it. Don't! Hey. We need to satisfy him more. Yeah, we need to work harder. What? Why do you need to satisfy him? Hey, get out! Get out! Mister, why are you sending us away when we haven't done it? Done what? Done what? We did it all, what do you mean? - Mister, we haven't... - No, we did! We did! I'm done! I'm so done! I'm so done! Get out! Get out right now! I'm done! Stop... Hey, stop. I'm professional. We need to do it until he's satisfied. Will you respect my job? Sure I will. - It's work ethic and pride, right? - Yeah. Pride. But why are you doing it? It's the same for me, pride. Yeah. A woman's pride is important. Hey... [Moans] [Screams in pain] Honey. Honey. Honey. [Sound of thunder] Huh? Lie down. Why? They... [Squeezes] left it here, asking if we're really done. Say that you did... [Moans] - You like it? - Love it. - Are you going crazy? - Where did you learn this? - I wasn't going to do this, but! - I can't open my eyes! - Here, here, like this! - More! You want it? You really want it? - How's it like? - A volcano! Me too! You're the best. I'm going crazy, it's so good! I can't open my eyes! - More oil here, please! - More, more! Wow, wow, wow. Wow, wow, wow. Wow. I'm so full! When did they put this sticker on? It wasn't there when I put it in the room. Do you know? How do I know? It's not coming off at all. But that girlfriend didn't doubt a thing? No. Not a doubt, she would have been sure of it. Girls are so quick-witted. - Really? - Of course. Why didn't she say anything then? We don't know what women want. Especially women who are in love. No one can really relate to them. I think it's the same for men. Huh? It's hard to explain someone in love. Something fishy. Huh? Are you seeing someone? No, I am not. Alright. Don't make faces. You don't believe me? I believe you. - No, you don't. - Yes, I do. No, you ain't. That sounds informal, too. This is so stuck. [Door locks] [Shutter sounds] Min-jeong. Yes? The weather's so good. Yeah. It's a beautiful day. What are we doing here? [Sighs] [Taking photos] Min-jeong. How long have you been single? A year... and 14 days. Wow, you've been counting? Yeah. I was dumped for not caring about anniversaries. So I decided to count days. Hey, do you think that's why he broke up with you? That's what he said. He just needed an excuse. Oh... You're so naive sometimes. Have you ever had sex with your boyfriend? I did, so many times. Really? That's a lie. I've done a one-night stand too. I like sex. When was the first time? In 10th grade. Wow. You broke up with your boyfriend. Then how do you... What do you mean? You said you like it, sex. My boyfriend wasn't good anyway. Mine, either. [Bowling pins and balls clatter] I mean, I wasn't going to say this. Talking about Geuntae Kim, right? Your ex. Yeah! He's so bad at sex! Really? But he looks like he has so much stamina. When I first did it, I thought it was because he was drunk. Yeah. But it was the same the second time, so I thought, maybe I couldn't arouse him enough. But it was the same 3rd and 4th time! Damn! I would have never guessed. Right? I think he had a self-accusation for not satisfying me. If I would react just a tiny bit less, - 'You don't like it?' - 'You don't like it?' Oh I hate it. And he would always finish first. He just fell asleep and snored without cuddling or anything. Hey, mine said another girl's name while we were doing it. No way, seriously? Yeah! Not someone you know, right? Not usually but yeah. Well, to be honest, I'm not really ready for a new relationship right now. Yeah. But! Sexual desire is different, right? Yeah. That's what I wanted to say. How often do you masturbate? Me? Once a week? Are you happy? No... Of course. Don't you want something stronger? These are sex toys? [Taking photos] Interesting. You wouldn't know what it is. Yes. What... do you like? [Suggestive music] What? Where does it feel good? Breasts. How do you like to be touched? How...? I don't know, really. [Music continues] What about touching you like this? I like it. How about this? Y... You heard me! Hey, let's try it. Okay. Hey. I said, do it this way. [Toys start buzzing] [Buzzing continues] [Toy buzzes louder] [Buzzing continues] [Moans] [Moans] Wow, this is amazing. Yeah. [Continues moaning] No kidding. Hey, Min-jeong. Yeah? I want to kiss. [Both Breath heavily] [Suggestive music continues] [Kissing] [Breathes heavily] I think you like being touched softly. What about you? What do you like? Me? I like everything. I'm all wet. Me too. [Stirs] Why were you late? Sorry. Are you happy with your boyfriend? How long has it been with your boyfriend? About a month? Really? Wow, you're a big girl now. My boyfriend is bigger than me. Oh my gosh! What? Whatever, call your boyfriend. You call yours. Let's go bowling. Okay! Don't get mad like the last time though. Okay? [Makes sexual noises] Hey! Wow! - Are you crazy? What the hell! - What? Da-hui. Have you used a vibrator? [Coughs] Oh my gosh! What the hell! I... don't like them. Why? You know. Because it feels too good. [Laughs] Feels too good? Oh, I see. You're afraid that you might not be satisfied by a man. Well... A little bit? I guess sex is not only about satisfying the sexual desire. I agreed. I want to interact and be sincere. You want to be in a relationship. Me? No way. Not at all! I love the work I do. Really? Well, to be honest, when I heard that you got a job at a motel with a bachelor in Hospitality Management, I wasn't sure if I had to congratulate you or not. Whether it be a hotel or a motel, it's still a place with people's stories and time. And to me, a motel feels more intimate so I always wanted to work in a motel. Look at you, changing the subject from the relationships to something. Was it too obvious? Of course! You go get it. - Cheers. - Cheers. Da-hui. I have something to ask. Yes. Do people still play drinking games? Bunny, bunny! Carrot, carrot! Of course. Drinking games will exist as long as alcohol exists in this world. Do you know a few? There is a story about why I know so many. It just came to me. Did it happen at a motel? You bet! - You wanna know? - You bet. Give me your ear. I'm all ears. I was working alone at night. Alone at night? [Suggestive music] Phone call. - Focus. - Okay. Why isn’t she picking up? Take them off. J... Just a minute. [Claps impatiently] [Claps] Come ! Here I am, fans! But I like being single. Right, single life is so carefree. - Couples! - Yeah, being a couple is great. I like the single life. Min-jae is and I've been friends forever. I was even there at his birth! Hey, I was born before you. Really? Which month were you born? Me? April. You're December, right? Yeah, but it doesn't matter! I invited her because you look lonely. I'm not lonely. No? I envy you, buddy. You two have met once before, right? Yeah. So I've invited Yeon-wu today. Huh? Isn't he just your type? So that explains the grand entrance. Hey, stop teasing me! - Actually before... - Stop it. This is so funny. Hey, leave Yeon-wu alone. I'm just saying she's really cool. Yeah. It's true. I'm going home. Isn't anyone going to stop me? Aren't you going to stop me? I don't believe this. Come on! Someone stop me! [All laugh] Random game! Hyeon-ji's favorite! Which game? Game start! Here we go! Let's go! - I... - I... - On a first date! - On a first date! I've had sex! Fold your finger. Hey, I haven't even finished one bottle. This is how we do it these days, buddy! Hyeon-seung! Fold your finger! You slept with me on the first day. You don't remember? I'll kill you! What? Of course I remember everything. Always fold one on the first round. Right, baby? Hey, hurry up! - I've had... - I've had... outdoor... Outdoor? sex! Wow, you're so cool! Holy shit! Respect! Respect! Hey, did you fold your finger? Well, it was summer. It was so hot. - So hot, he said! - No AC at home? May be he had the fan going! Doing it outdoors! [All scream in shock] Hey, your turn. - I... - I... masturbate at least three times a week. Fold if you do! What? I knew it! Three times! That's nothing! I knew it! Hyeon-seung! Really? Three times a week? Yeah... Well, baby... It's not that. I'm just a frisky guy. That's all. Oh, this isn't good. Drink up and let's finish with this one. - Yeah, drink up! - But this is fun! Drink, Hyeon-seung. Okay. You're not mad at me, right? Just drink. [Playful music] [Pouring] [Satisfied noise] [Music continues] [Laughs] It's so short. Is it even possible? So short. Can you really do it? Let me. It's gone. Where did it go? Where is it? They just kissed. Hello, this is room 203. Is the next room empty? I'm just joking! This is really something. Penalty drink! - I'll drink it. - No, I'll do it! What the! Do I feel romance in the air? What the! Next comes baby, honey, pumpkin? Hey, shut up. What the! Are you guys embarrassed? I feel happy for them. I love ya... Love ya more... [Kissing] Hey! Stop it. But this is how the game works. - Come here. - Are you really gonna do it? But it's just a game. I know but... Hey, Hyeon-seung! I'll drink the penalty shot. Why would you do that? Huh? I'm thirsty. Party pooper! Baby! Shall we juice it up a bit? Whatever. Okay! Let's play Lick Her or Liquor! Again? Of course. Come here. Hey! You jerk! Are you a dog on heat? What? But we agreed... I'm leaving. What? Seung-hye! What's the matter? Seung-hye! Seung-hye! [Silence] Hey... Are you okay? I think so. He must be really smashed. Yeah. He's not like that usually. Today he had too much... Shall we have another drink? Oh... Okay. [Suggestive music] Yeon-wu. Yeah? I know this might sound weird but actually, I've never done this before. I mean really being in the moment. Being honest about it. When moments come together they become something more. If you miss those moments, then they become nothing. Can I kiss you? [Kissing] [Music continues] Miss. Do you have any plans after work? Not really. Do you need something? I need to tell you something. Okay. [Door opens] Hey, get inside! I'm so nervous! We'll be fine, right? I'll take a shower first. No, I want to feel you as you are. Such a Cheol Buff! You're so crazy about me. Oh, no! What should we do? [Door locks] Umm... Would you like to drink something? Oh... An Americano, please. Me too. [Playful music] Oh, please wait here! Two Americanos, please. - That was quick. - Yes. So bitter! [Laughs] Oh, I'm supposed to cover my mouth when I... Actually... I don't drink Americano. I'm in my thirties, but I'm crazy about anything strawberry so I'm known as Strawberry Buff. Actually, I don't drink Americanos either. I'm in my thirties, but I'm crazy about anything banana so I'm known as Banana Buff. My name is Kim Cheol-su. Hi. My name is Kim Yeong-hui. Yeong-hui? Like Jill? Cheol-su? Like Jack? Banana Buff? Strawberry Buff? [Laugh together] [Laughing in joy] Yeong-hui, that's too high! It's okay. This is so much fun! You'll hurt yourself. By the way, Yeong-hui! Is this your first blind date? No. I've been on many. That can't be true! What? Why would any men let you go? Oh, come on! You're not Strawberry Buff, I think you're Yeong buff! Yeong Buff? - Yeong-hui! So Yeong buff! - Yeong-hui! So Young buff! You're so clever! I'm supposed to cover my mouth when I laugh. How many girlfriends have you had? Try and guess. Could it be... None? Have you been waiting for me until now? Bingo! I've never dated anyone. Guess how many boyfriends I've had? Oh, you've had boyfriends... N... No. What? I guess I was waiting for someone like you. I've never had a boyfriend either. Yeong-hui! I bet you can't guess my nickname. Strawberry Buff? No. My friends call me something else. What could it be? Wizard. Wizard, like the urban myth. Wizard? Right. If you've never had a girlfriend, still have your virginity by the time your turn thirty, you become a wizard. Yeong-hui! Where... Where have you been all my life? I'm a wizard too. I'm quite famous among my friends. Wow... Today is just magic. Yes. It really is pure magic. Do you guys like playing with bubbles? It's so old-fashioned. I still like blowing bubbles. We look okay, don't we? Yes, shall we go out now? Hey, get inside! I'm so nervous! We'll be fine, right? I'll take a shower first. No, I want to feel you as you are. Such a Cheol Buff! You're so crazy about me. Oh, no! What should we do? [Silence] [Silence continues] [Chuckles nervously] Is this a dream? It isn't, is it? I'm so happy that it's you, Yeong-hui. With you, it doesn't matter if this is magic or not. [Soft music] What were you doing just then? In the books, they tell you to recite ABCD. Isn't it ㄱㄴㄷ, the Korean alphabet? Then shall I go with the lower case? Okay. I think they are gone. Okay, let's go out. Go out slowly. I'll try. Okay. [Moans in pain] Does it hurt? - Cheol-su! - Yes? I don't think that's the right place. Oh? Then where am I? Well... That's not right anyway. [Moans] Does it hurt? It does, but it feels good. Miss Song! Yes? I have deep feelings for you. Where did that come from? I have for a long time. I was going to tell you before. I don't know if this is the right moment. But I can't help it. - Hey! - I... I just want to show you my heart. So you know how I feel about you. But don't give it much thought. How can I not? Okay. Then do. I want you to think about me. Well, well! Is this day one for us then? No. This is love for us. You are just so clever! Oh, you! Yeong-hui! Don't run! You'll hurt yourself! - Catch me if you can! - My heart just jumped! I've always wanted to do this! Wait for me, Yeong-hui! Miss, what I said before... - Hey! - Yes? Don't call me Miss. Pardon? Sounds less formal. I might give it a thought at least. Let's get back to work. Where do you think you're going? - Huh? - The guests are gone. So we have to tidy up the room. But we just did it. No, we didn't! Hey! What happened to Miss?
