200 Million Years Ago 150 Million Years Ago 100 Million Years Ago 65 Million Years Ago 30 Million Years Ago 10 Million Years Ago 3 Million Years Ago Now... SUBMERSION OF JAPAN Misaki Harbor, Kanagawa The government officials... ...shouldn't be that nervous. A tiny island sank. So what? Onodera. Meet Dr. Tadokoro. I understand you study undersea volcanoes. My name is Onodera. From the company. I study geophysics. Volcanoes are only part of it That's it! I had to beg your managing director... ... for admission to this. So do many others. But another submarine is coming soon. Then we can have two submarines to use. Can we go down 10km? Yes, but... My company doesn't want me... ...to go deeper than 2km. I asked if the submarine can sink 10km. North of the Bonin Islands. Goodbye. It's only 400 meters deep. A pleasant trip. It's funny to see the underworld through the radar. I hope so. But not with him. The eruption didn't cause the crack. The crack is caused by other reasons. The volcanoes activities didn't cause the island to be submerged. How deep is the crater? 96 meters. Is this usual here? Ripple marks! volcanic bombs! The mud is apparently moving. And the scope of the movement is great. It's gradually going down. It's more like a slide. That could cause the submersion of the island... ...the slide Then what caused a slide of that size? What is it? I don't know. Shit! I really can't figure out... ...the reasons of the slide. Maybe we can find out in the Japan Deep. Let's go there tomorrow. Onodera. Can we? we could go down 100km. If the sea were that deep. But we can't stay long. There's a report. Around the Bousou peninsula... Some drastic changes have been found... ...at the Japan Deep. After finishing the investigation of the submerged island... Please go and have a look at the Japan Deep. The investigation of the island is finished. We'll see the Japan Deep. We're going to dive. 1500 meters. 3000 meters. The slope to the Deep. 11 kilometers. 25 degrees. The slope is less steep on the other side. About 10 to 15 degrees. 8000 meters. Anything wrong? Deep-sea current. Current? Here? I often experienced it. But not one that big. 3.5 knots an hour. The deepest spot. 8740 meters. Signs of a new bottom-current. The old one's there. They cross. Make a turn. 7 degrees to the right. Onodera, what's that? I don't know. I've seen the bottom a fewtimes... ...but not that one. Let's go. Followthe trail of a slug. 8500 meters. It's muddy here. Are you Ok? Hercules! Hercules! Come in, Yuki. This is the Wadatsumi. This is Hercules. Did you feel a shock now? I'll see. Not a recorded. The probe is at 100 meters belowthe sea. But nothing can be checked out. No visible oscillation. Okay. We found a funny trench here. We'll trace it northward. Understood. Sound every minute. Understood. We'll go this way. Okay. The trench disappears in the mud cloud. Stop. To the bottom! We can't. It's dangerous! We did before! Then, a flare. Let's go down. But... 50 meters at least. Temperature! Density! Be careful, Onodera. Be ready to go up any time. Density current! South to north... Contrary to the usual. Density:1.053. The highest ever recorded. Salinity... No wonder it's heavy. A lot of heavy metal ion! Take water! No time! A flare! Professor! Look! Mud current! At the bottom! That's the earth's crust... ...under the Japanese Islands! The Japan Deep... North from Kamchatka... And southward to the Marianas... 3000 kilometers! The world's longest deep. I wonder... A catastrophe is happening at the bottom! The car will go backto the Police Headquarters. Go ahead. The Prime Minister is home at 20:43 Understand. Welcome home. Hi, Yasuko. Long time not see. Your baby? Yes. How cute! As a government official... You've concentrated on work for eight years. He's like your grandson. Yes, yes. Come, let me have a look. Won't you change? Men have strange senses. Words that missed their attention... ...suddenly come backto them. The prime Minister is worried... About the changes... Thank you... ...for your interesting geophysical stories. That earth is undergoing drastic changes... ...which we haven't experienced before. Japan's structural line is changing. But what I want to know is... A more simple explanation. Why was the deep crack formed... ...beside the Japanese Islands? Please explain it. As I told you before... ...the earth is like an egg. More exactly a boiled egg. The shell of the egg... We call it the earth's crust. It's very thin. The portion equivalent to the white... We call it mantle. It means an overcoat. Inside is the core. The core is liquid. In that sense... We should say the earth is like a half-boiled egg. Let's discuss the mantle... ...beneath the shell. It's solid material, but... Very slow movement is activated in it. A current that moves a few centimeters a year. A solid current? Yes. Like the steel puncheons... ...in tunnel construction. They bend in years. You must have seen it. Even solid material moves. Is there a film on mantle convection? Yes. The one you supervised. Inside the solid mantle... We call the slow movement mantle convection. There are upward and downward movements. Volcanoes form along the ups... ...deeps along the downs. The current sways. Like the fluid heated by an alcohol lamp... ...rises and sways. Undersea volcanoes rise here. The current of heated material sways levelly... ...then goes down. And a deep forms there... like the Japan Deep. It grows deeper. Soil is washed from land to fill the deep. It makes a thick deposit. Later it rises to form mountains. Like the Japanese Islands. There is a current in the ground. That's unbelievable. Nobody has seen it. Everybody has. Start with the Atlantic. Okay. This is the Atlantic. The undersea volcanoes lie along the center line. Like the bone of a fish. Heated material rises up here and flows in all directions. Along with the flowing movement, very slowly... The continents move. This is what we can understand. They used to be joined together. But the convection forced them to move away. Finally they were separated... ...as we see them today. The convection caused the continental drift. They are inter-related. Let's have a look at the Pacific. Undersea volcanoes are here. Let's remove the water. We can see the center line. Heated material comes up here. It crosses the ocean. And sinks at the Japan Deep. It pulls in part of the crust, The tip of the Japan island is pulling down... ...which sometimes countermoves. The countermove caused an earthquake. Fused material comes up with earthquakes to form volcanoes. They're the results of underground current. They're inter-related. Understand? The earth moves. It's alive. It's a great big living being. That clarifies the mysteries... ...of earthquakes and volcanoes. Minister. I had a chance to observe it. A small island north of the Bonins sank 200 meters overnight. I sawthe mud current... ...at the bottom of the Japan Deep. The recent earthquake centers were... ...off the east coast. It's true... ...something is happening under Japan. But nobody knows what it is. We aren't here to discuss it. But to give the ministers a brief idea. That's right. I came to warn the Prime Minister. As administrator, get ready for a catastrophe. A great earthquake? Possibly. I don't know what'll happen next. I really have no idea. We have to make... ...a thorough investigation of the sea bottom. I'm busy. Excuse me. He hasn't changed. Don't take it too serious. What he said is in the future. It isn't expected soon. But I understand he's internationally famous. Oh, yes... Because he's patronized... ...by the BAC Foundation. Really? I forgot it. Not when I'm busy! Mr Tadokoro? Mr. Watari is waiting. He's here. Mr Tadokoro? Take your seat. I have something to ask you. About swallows. Swallows? Yes. They used to build their nests... ...under the roof of my house. Last May they came and built their nests, but... They went away in July. I don't know why. They haven't come back since. What does it mean? It's the same story with the other swallows. Some say it's because terrestrial magnetism changed. Or caused by the changing weather. I don't think so. Swallows are fewer...one percent of the usual. Not only birds. But also circular fishes. What's happening? Is it some premonition? I can't say what it is. I'm desperately trying to find out. All I've got is anxiety... ...for something unknown. I understand. One more question. What's the most important thing for a scientist? Inspiration. Inspiration? This way you can tell... ...the pieces of paper used to be together. In 1912 Wegener thought as he watched a map of the world... Europe, America and Africa could have been together. He called this the inspiration. He publicized his theory of continental drift. But science hadn't progressed enough... ...to prove it. The world laughed at him. He died in 1930 unrewarded. But now... Nobody doubts his theory of continental drift. We bough a French submarine for you. And it is not hired. We hear the Kermadec... ...can dive 10,000 meters. It's confidential. Concering the BAC Foundation. After the contract end... ...I want you to break with it. Professor Yukinaga... ...will take part in this project. Will he? Then, what project? I believe you'll join us. My name is Kunieda. Government staff. I'm Nakata. I study information science. Of natural phenomena. "D Plan promoted by Yusuke Tadokoro." Add whomever you need. The pilot? Not a Frenchman. If you have somebody on mind. Him! Nobody else. I'll coax him. "Toshio Onodera" What's your part? I'm secretary to the Prime Minister. I am not include in the D plan. If you want to see the Prime Minister, just tell me. The earthquake registered 2. The center is at 130"14 E Long And 35"25 N Lat. According to the BAC report... One of the Okinawan undersea volcanoes... ...started erupting. Onodera quit the firm. He wrote from Marseille. Yesterday the Kermadec came here. It is in here! The submarine? Nominally a Kobe firm bought it. How can it be? But a big organization is behind it. They are digging under the sea. He left us for them. He worked for the French. But he isn't a guy like that. stop here. Onodera What's the matter? Come back. The company needs you. Oh no, most importantly... You need me to watch you when you dive. Otherwise, how can you dive? I came to Tokyo today. The last earthquake killed my father. After the funeral and things are settled I'll go abroad. When you're back, call me at my villa. Nothing to talk about, but... I want to see you. Hi. Tough work! Without even a holiday. To the sea of the Kinka mountain... The investigation is over as planned. Yes. Where is the ship now? It's 5843 meters deep. Wind is at north-east, 12 knots an hour. Sit down. I'll explain. Now let me to start... It's about the drastic changes in the Pacific mantle. The earth's crust moves. The mantle current... ...causes it to form land and to drift. The size of the current depends on the core. If the size of the core remains unchanged, it'll be no effects. The core is growing bigger and bigger. It takes time for land to drift. Because the mantle current... ... is very, very slow. When the core grows to some extent... ...the current changes. The change is instantaneous. This is an America... ...lndian geophysicist' theory. Physically that's correct. The earth is growing. Faster and faster, like a living beings. It doesn't repeat its history. It creates new situations. But what'll happen next... We know little about it. But...Dr. While the data can't tell... How can you tell...? Imagination helps. Things that stimulate it are enough. Expanding minus gravitation areas... ...increasing subterranean heat... Sinking sea bottoms... They prove the mantle is going down. The dramatic changes caused the unusual case. The crust of Japan's Pacific coast... ...will either shrink or break up. Dr. Tadokoro Even children can tell the rest of the story. The Japan Sea mantle pushes the Japanese Islands. The Pacific mantle... ...supports them against the push. But the support'll be gone. What kind of cataclysm? What'll be the damage? Who knows? Will a great earthquake occur? Possibly. But that's nothing. A lot worse. In the worst case... The Japanese Islands will sink into the sea. What! A report! A great earthquake occurred around Tokyo. Help me! Help me! No fire. The earthquake last time... Fire killed thousands of men last time. Don't worry. No gas ovens or stoves. Plazas aren't safe. The earthquake last time... Forty thousand died in a square before. We'll be safe if there's no fire. "Countermeasure Headquarters" The survey plane? We're trying to get in contact. Come in, U-173. Headquarters calling. "The Government proclaimed a state of emergency." Repeat once more, "At 18:50 Tokyo, Kanagawa, Chiba and Saitama Prefectures are... ...in a state of emergency." This is U-173, the survey plane. 300 places in Central Tokyo... ...got fires. The people who live there... ... are swarming around the... ...lmperial Palace to escape the fire. The fireman? Where are the firemen? Approximately 6000 fires in Tokyo. All the roads are jammed. The 20m s wind, too... ...keeps away the fire engines. Even if they get to the fire, water supply is insufficient. Helicopters? Here? Yes, to put out the fire. Make them defend the administration center. You're wrong. Make them defend the people. Chief of Staff. Yes. Only send out helicopters is not enough. Can't we use ordinary fighters... ...to put out the fire? No. It's dangerous. They can't fly as low as helicopters. It's dangerous and can cause greater confusion. Call Yokosuka. Emergency information. Come in, Yokosuka Headquarters. Yokosuka Headquarters. This is Countermeasure Headquarters. I'm the chairman. Send all of the Self Defense Corps helicopters... ... to Tokyo. As requested by the head officer... They're to put out the fire in Yokohama. You mean we'll give up Yokohama? Here is a report to the Countermeasure Headquarters. At 1820 hour... ...according to the report... The earthquake has not stop... Helicopters to Tokyo... ...can't do much after all. But they're the only things... ...that help put out fire. what can fighters defend? The nation? Who can say... ... they defend the people? This is Police Headquarters. Go ahead. The people are surrounding the palace. They are in a mess. Can we use guns? Give us instructions. Many people fell. Maybe the heat killed them. Open the gates! No entry! You can't go in! Pease, open the gates! Please, only the child will do. Call the Palace. The Director. Imperial Household Office. Headquarters calling. Go ahead. Open the gates! This is Yamamoto. Open the gates! This is from the "Countermeasure Headquarters" As Prime Minister, I order it! Open the gates to the people! Yes. Shall we keep working here? Or other places? Anyway we want more extinguishing bombs. The operation is over. What? There are no more bombs. Land for refueling. Engage in sending information. Minister. No precise information, but... Tokyo's three rivers flooded and washed out the lower east side. Some of the areas are under the water. That's been confirmed. The district has no way out in an emergency. How many people are there? About seven hundred thousand. The western residential districts have been released from fire. Medical troups are activated at places. Food and water? Tanktrucks are working. The Self-Defense Corps has rations for... ...1,100,000 people. Only 1,100,000? You knowthe population... By the way, how many casualties are caused... ...by the earthquake, the fire and the flood? I don't know. Maybe one million... No. Could be a lot more. Why the disaster? Is it something to herald that cataclysm? Persons Dead or Missing. 3.6million. After three months of hell... The aftermath of the disaster... ...is at last replaced by peace. Funny. I hear my late wife say... "Japan is a peaceful country. I thought... "You are the most ordinary Prime Minister. "You wouldn't have to go down in history. "But now you've done what you have to do. "It's time to leave office. Refresh the people." I think so, but...I can't quit. If I quit now... ... we'll have to drop the D Plan. It isn't official. I can't pass it to the next cabinet. Move it here. DC center, this is D1 headquarter. Now look atA & B monitors. Connect the output to RM position. CRTtest. Will "it" come? I doubt it. The earthquake in Tokyo... A cataclysm 1000 times greater! I can't believe it. You're wrong. The more the data, the greater the possibility. What'll happen? I think most of the people will die. Why? Because they don't believe such a catastrophe will happen. What? Mr. Tadokoro? Out. He went to the Congress. To talk with the Prime Minister about D2 Plan. D2 Plan? We're D1. The other team, D2, is for evacuation. But the Prime Minister is too busy to see him. This made Mr. Tadokoro feels so uneasy. He wants to go to the old man in Hakone. By the way, as we got some more money... We'll have two more submarines. We could charter... ...Wadatsumi 1 and 2. You... You... You... Stop! Don't worry. Get in. Onodera Why didn't you tell me? Everybody in the company is worrying about you. Do you knowthat? The firm who bought the Kermadec... ...hired our boats. I thought you might be with them. And I got you. I know what kind of person you are now. I... I 'll quit the company too. No more Kermadecs. You've got your own. I'll be with you. To watch over you. By the way... A young lady came to our office yesterday. She is looking for you. She was worried. Miss Reiko Abe. Have a good look. Japan's mountains and lakes. Are they really going to sink? Mr. Tadokoro... ... howfirmly do you believe it? The investigation proves I'm right. As Mr. Nakata explained a while ago... D1 Plan is for research. We need the new D2 Plan for evacuation. It's coming. Don't worry. The last earthquake in Tokyo... ...sankthe Hakone mountains. They want to rise. Mr. Nakata. Yes. Research is something you can keep secret. But not evacuation. It's a national crisis. What if we promote the plan... ...and the catastrophe never comes? Then all of us who is sitting here... We'll be called crazy liars. Nobody'll listen to us again. But if the cataclysm does happen... ...and we're ready for it... Better than nothing... 5% of the population will be saved. 5% of 100 million is 5 million. I see. I'll go to Tokyo. "D2 Plan" The plan needs a lot of money. We can't keep it a secret. It will be... It won't remain a desk plan. Take a boat or a plane. Go abroad to negotiate. An International problem. I'll reshuffle the cabinet. The Foreign, Trade and Industry Ministers... ...will be newfaces... ...who are internationally known. Even a non-official will be alright... But Prime Minister, if you do this... ...the secretary general won't agree. Nowthat public peace is restored... We should be realistic. We must concentrated on the internal affairs. What if the premonition is a mistake? What if it's just an illusion of that funny geophysicist? Or just a mistake... ...then what shall we do? The Japanese people are too smart. If a crazy man had shouted an earthquake would level Tokyo... And if the journalists had written... Though it wouldn't help win the general election... The Government and the parties... ...have had to take it into consideration. If we've been ready for it... ...there would've been fewer casualties. Of course it will be right if no one died. Canberra, Australia The Prime Minister's Villa You said our country is big. But in reality, 70% of our land... ...is dessert. How many people do you want us to take? One million for the first immigration. One million? Two million for the second immigration. If possible... ...we would like you to accept five million in all. Mr. Nosaki, is what you saying really possible? Like the submersion of Atlantis? It's just not a possibility, it's a reality. It is 70% certain... ...the catastrophe will take place within two years. That's all I was told. You would make your request through the United Nations. Or negotiate with other big countries. Especially the Soviet Union and China. They have vast territory in Asia. Negotiation with those countries... ...has already begin. Japanese prostrating itself. Begging, inpouring every nations in the world. Please help save the life... ...and the future of the people of Japan. I'm afraid this isn't much as a gift. But Prime Minister Yamamoto present this to you. Together with his warmest regards. Twelve century! Late Fujihara! If we've to accept things from Japanese... ...we prefer the treasure rather than people. I would do. If we accept 5 million Japanese. They will simply use our land and resources... ...to build themselves another country. "The Future of the Japanese Race" One Buddhist priest... One sociologist... And one psychologist wrote it. They're at my villa in Hakone. They worked day and night. The Emperor to Switzerland? One lmperial Prince to America. And another prince to Africa, if possible. Three envelopes? They contain three plans... ... for three possible cases. One: part of the Japanese people... ...will build a new nation. Two: they'll disperse... ...to be naturalized in other countries. Three: for those who aren't accepted by any country. In the third envelope, there is another opinion. That's the conclusion the three men finally reached. That is... We'll do nothing. Nothing? Nothing. All of the 110 million Japanese people... ...will sink into the ocean together. That's best for Japan and the Japanese people. But... That's a personal opinion. Ignore it. I just wanted to let you know... ...there is such an opinion. I think it would better to do so. "U.S. Geodetic Meeting" Judging from the reports... ... of our geodetic satellite and ships... Part of the Far East continental shelf... ...will suffer... ...a tremendous disturbance... ...like one never experienced by man before. The possibility is so great! "Japan Doomed!" "Will Japan Follow Atlantis?" The announcement is made... ... two days earlier than planned. "A Tremendous Structural Disturbance of the Earth's Crust Threatening Japan!" "Japan will Sink!" "Japan Has only a Year!" As Prime Minister of the Japanese Government... I have to tell you sad news. Our nation is meeting a crisis... ... unlike any experienced before. As you heard from foreign news sources... ...you must know it. In the near future... ...at the center of Japan Islands... ...will have dramatic changes ... ...a structural disturbance of the earth's crust... ...will completely destroy the islands of Japan. Concerning this... It is confirmed by... ... our scientists and government staff. As I expected! You leaving today? Yes. It's my last chance... ...to catch the flight. Congratulations As the Prime Minister has just announced... ...as one of the emergence plan... ...he will forbid any personal trip tomorrow. But you don't look happy. Why? It's funny. I thought I'd be glad to leave Japan. Only say goodbye. But not now. No sentimentality. Everybody who has the chance... ...should get away. But you're going to stay here, aren't you? Mr. Kunieda and Mr. Kataoka, too. Don't worry. We're old enough to take care of ourselves. You are young. You can do whatever you like! We won't die with Japan. The D2 Plan is excellent. It'll save millions of people. We'll meet again. My Swiss address. Get in contact with me. Don't forget... ...Yuki on the Wadatsumi in the Japan Sea. Please send my regards to him. Goodbye. This is from the Mt. Fuji. At 13:27. Mt. Fuji. started erupting! We can see it. It's me. For you. Hello. It's you. Where...? Hello? At the foot of Mt. Fuji? We're leaving today. I went home yesterday. Ah! Hello? I left there at seven. But here... What? Louder! What did you say? The ashes! Onodera! You have the tickets. I can't go. Don't wait for me. I'll come to you later. Go ahead. I'll see you again. I definitely will. Don't be silly! Get out of there! Walk! Crawl! Geneva... At Geneva... Onodera! Onodera! "U.N. Special Committee to Assist Japan" The Japanese government has so far... ...sponsored the emigration of... ...7,800,000 to 21 countries. With personal emigration of 600,000... Only 8,400,000 in all could escape. The rest of the population of Japan... ... 101,600,000 has no place to go. There's the time limit. We must first decide... ... the place for temporary evacuation... ...as requested by the Japanese. "If they stay... "...longer than expected... ...they may well cause problems. Hostilities... Slums... Epidemics and crimes could increase where they went. Concerning temporary evacuation... The Palestinians have lots of problems... Let's hear from the representative from Jordan. 700000 Palestinians. This figure... It's equivalent to 35% of our population. This is a problem But the migration now being discussed involves... ... 110 million ... 157 times more than that. Who could present a solution? Tokyo Bay Osaka International Airport Connect A ` B ` CRT How long? An hour. No, 50 minutes. Faster. The Pacific Coast line... ...of eastern Japan worries me. The U.N. meetings, too... ...held 15 times in two months. Two months to emigrate... ...only 2,800,000 people. Though it is the U.N. ... What the hell are our ministers doing? If a race loses its country... The land where they live... They have no right... ...to maintain survival in another country. That's the current opinion... of the U.N., oh no, of the world. That's not the point. Their nature is totally different! Suppose a Pacific island... ...no, the same in everywhere... ...with 100,000 inhabitants sinks... What should we do? Japan would house them... ...say 5,000 or 10,000 inhabitants? ...and that'll be all. The point is 110,000,000 people. It's the vast number. Recently, a zoologist told me... ...something like this... 200 Million Years Ago... Reptiles once ruled the earth. They perished because... They pushed away the other animals... To make the world theirs. They increased too much. Minister. You believe the same thing will happen to mankind? Mr. Watari. I admire the three... ... who thought of the fundamental D2 Plan. "Do nothing." Because of the thought... ...gave us the three ideas. Mankind will perish someday. The realization of our resurrection... No. The realization of our survival... ...helps us think howto survive. The U.N. or the Foreign Ministry... ...can't do much. From next weeks... I'll negotiate with the foreign governments myself. I'll beg their leaders... ...to accept 100,000, if not... ... even 10,000 refugees, and they can't... Even 1000, even 100. Even one. Reptiles had cold blood. Men have warm blood. I believe in it. There's nothing else I can do. Excuse me. An emergency call. Has it begun? Yes. To be careful... The expected day has changed. Sooner than expected. Much sooner! Shikoku and Kii Peninsula You're short of survey planes? Yes, one more. We need one more by all means. Let's go. Okay. Southeast Shikoku The U.S. President (Simultaneous interpreting) To save the Japanese... We have already dispatched... ...our 7th Fleet. All other units of our Pacific Fleet... ...are also sailing for Japan. Our three air divisions... 5th, 7th and 23rd... ...have started rescue activities. On the other hands, concerning the refugees... I'll present to Congress a bill for... ...emergency construction of refugee camps... ...in Arizona, Nevada and Utah. The People of China decided... ...to dispatch all her fleets... ...to Kyushu and Okinawa. Thank you. Our ships are small and efficient... ...so they can reach any shore. They can transport the Japanese people... ...to larger ships... ...or according to the situations... ...will even send the people directly to China. The rough sea forced us... ... to change the points of embarkation. Due to the tsunami... The people of Kyoto and Hyogo Prefectures... ... should go to Maizuru and Tsuruga... ...along the Japan Sea coast. The Russian Far East Fleet... ...will arrive there with transport ships. The people of Okayama, Hiroshima and Yamaguchi... ...should go to the four airfields... ...along the Japan Sea coast. Russian TU transports will be send ... ...to the four airfields, each with 60 airplanes... 240 in all, will be coming. Mr. Yukinaga, I'm amazed. When Japan is sinking... ...the world offers a helping hand. Though they don't believe the sinks at first. That's life We're going to enter Osaka. Altitude 1000. Okay. Can you see it? You aren't above Osaka yet. We are. This is Osaka. Eight million for a month? They escaped in May. Every country sent her naval force to our rescue. On the other hands, the U.N. decided... Sponsored by the governments of each nations... Every airway company... ... supplies us with its aircraft. More than ten million people... ...will get away this month. The Prime Minister was right. What? If only we have five or six months. some say the earth... ...let out the energy necessary for a cataclysm. It's about time to stop. Sanriku Beach. Tohoku District Hokkaido Kinki District Tango Peninsula This territory has so far received no damage. Wait! There's a warning. Don't go out. The tsunami is coming, don't you know? Shut up. How can you tell? Report to Kyoto. Some fishing boats... ... are heading for Korea. Stop them. Listen to the D1's warning. Tidal waves are expected on the Japan Sea coast. The tsunami is coming. Refugees on the fishing boats, go back! Please come back! The tsunami is expected. I repeat what I have said. Korean shores are strictly guarded. No free entry. Go back! Believe me! Go back! Kyushu Okinawa (Simultaneous interpreting) On the Japanese Islands... There are 76 million people... Other than 13 million casualties... 63 million people are still waiting. Their government is naturally desperate to rescue them. And the argument of human rights from the world. It's difficult to set a time limit. When should we stop the rescue mission? It's so hard to made a decision. When will everyone be convinced? Let's hear from the Doctor's opinion. There's something strange. We don't understand... This zone of fractures across Central Japan. We thought this would be... ... the first area to break up. There's a great amount of energy. Three times as much as... ...considered necessary to start a cataclysm. But no movement. Some activities in the earth's crust... ...have its own pattern... ...which are beyond our knowledge. But when it starts moving... The remaining area of Japan... ...will quickly be destroyed. The first movement of the zone... ...will terminate the rescue operation... ...from all of the world. Stop. Concerning the time... Eleven days and seven hours to go. Kunieda? Yes? Have the Prime Minister send the lmperial Family to Switzerland. The government will retreat... ...and go to Yap. The Committee? Tell them later. "Are the Japanese People Kamikaze?" I'll save them all. I'll save my girl. I can't leave Japan... ... before I find her. I can understand why the Prime Minister is desperated Like the Kamikaza pilot. But why this young man? What does he means? A newtype of Kamikaze? Well, anyway, 34 million Kamikaze like people... ...are grieving throughout the world. I wonder what will happen next? Accidentally, should I have Japan removed from the map? No, wait until we get the official U.S. observation satellite report. Some of the islands are still above water. D1 members: Yamamoto speaking. Today at 13:30... I ordered the Defense Corps... ...to terminate the rescue operation. The D1 Plan terminates accordingly. You have worked hard for a long time. Thank you. "Not a trace of smoke in sight, Not a single cloud, either." Has Japan sunk? Too far to see. What's Mr. Tadokoro doing? And Onodera? Goodbye. Mr. Watari. Ah! Good luck, Prime Minister. Please take care of my niece. Hanae. Get married to a Japanese boy somewhere. No, not particularly Japanese. Any race will do. Get married and be happy. And... Have nice children. You must hurry, sir. Or you will be in danger! Tadokoro! Mr. Tadokoro! It's dangerous here. Come. I'll die with Japan. No! How can you do this? You saved millions of people. Is it good or bad? Mr. Tadokoro! Minister. The Japanese people are young as a race. Raised under the protection of Nature. Like a child. Even if they fought and lost beyond their country... They could come home. They could whimper in their homeland. How wonderful it is! But not any more. They have no home to come backto. They'll be alone among wise foreigners. Please take care of them. Mr. Tadokoro. I believe in the Japanese people. Keep well, Minister. Yes. I...I loved Japan. I will love her. Forever. Mr. Tadokoro. Goodbye. Somewhere in the world.
