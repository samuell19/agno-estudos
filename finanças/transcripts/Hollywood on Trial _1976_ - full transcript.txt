Many were members of the Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals, which had supported studio management during the strikes. The alliance had long fought the growing image of a left-wing Hollywood. - I am here to defend the industry that I have spent a greater part of my life in. I am not here to... I am here to defend the producers and the motion picture industry. - [Thomas] What have you heard from Hollywood as to the uh... feeling on the part of a producer, about producing anti-communist films? - Well, I heard they were going to... I believe that would be an incredible success, and if the first picture was made, I think it follow with, as we do in Hollywood, there would be many, many, many more made. I think it would be a very wonderful thing to see one made. I would like to see a picture of the Bulgarian situation. I would like to see that shown to the American public so they would see how communism works. I would like to see the brutal beatings, the stabbings, the killings, the shootings. - I'm proud of the motion picture industry, I am proud of its record in war and peace. With press and radio it shares today a solemn trust to preserve our sacred freedom of speech and fight with our every energy any attempt to use that freedom as a cloak for subversive assassins of liberty. I'm just hopeful, like I told your Mr. Smith in California that perhaps out of this hearing, our Congress, recommended by this committee, will have legislation, there can be no question to give us a policy how to handle American citizens who don't deserve to be if they are communists, to get them out of our place. - I would suggest that the Congress of the United States immediately enact such legislation as will preserve the Bill of Rights to the people for whom it was designed. That precious bill was never intended to protect enemy agents, saboteurs and spies, whether they're American or alien born. - We didn't get the Bill of Rights in order to protect quislings, and I think if we're going to spend 12 billion dollars or whatever it is to contain the communists in Greece, that we oughta spend at least a couple of bucks over here and do something about that. What good is it doing it over there and not getting rid of it here? They use the techniques of character assassination, and if they ever get control of the screen or of the country it won't be just the characters they'll assassinate. - I feel that they really oughta be smoked out, and shown up for what they are so that all the good free causes in this country, all the liberalisms that really are American can go out without disdain of communism. - Had it not been for the communist activities in the motion picture studio unions, there would have been no strikes. And the violence, as I said, there is an official report here, which said that much of the violence was from the direct result of communist infiltration. - [Thomas] Well from your own opinion, would you say that the violence on the picket lines was due to the communists on the picket lines? - Much of it, yes. - Yes sir, I can name a few who seem to sort of disrupt things once in a while. Whether or not they're communists, I don't know. - [Thomas] Would you name those for the committee, please? - Well, the one chap I'm thinking of currently is Mr. Howard Da Silva, who always seems to have something to say at the wrong time. Well, I know of several writers... I know of several writers in the motion picture business who are reputedly fellow travelers or possibly communists, I don't know about that. - [Thomas] You have no personal knowledge of it yourself, then? - I know one gentleman employed at the studio at which I'm employed. Mr. Lester Cole, who is reputedly a communist. I wouldn't know personally. - [Thomas] What is your present occupation? - An actor. (crowd laughter) (gavel banging) - [Thomas] How do you believe the principle medium is that they use Hollywood or the industry to inject propaganda? - Well I...if it stems from word of mouth, then... - [Thomas] Can you speak louder please, Mr. Cooper? - I believe it stems through word of mouth and through... the medium of...pamphleting and...writers I suppose. - I am happy to speak openly and honestly in an inquiry which has for its purpose, the reaffirmation of American ideals and democratic processes. As last May when I appeared before a sub-committee of this group in Los Angeles, my testimony is based on personal opinions, impressions and beliefs created by the things I have read, heard and seen. It is given freely and voluntarily. Ideology, terms, ideological terms rather, termites have burrowed into many American industries, organizations and societies. Wherever they may be, I say let us dig them out and get rid of them. My brothers and I will be happy to subscribe generously to a pest removal fund. We are willing to reestablish such a fund to ship to Russia the people who don't like our American system of government, and prefer the communistic system to ours. Subversive germs breed in dark corners. Let's get light into those corners. That, I believe, is the purpose of this hearing, and I am happy to have had the opportunity to testify. - [Narrator] 19 new witnesses were subpoenaed, only 11 were called to testify. The first 10 refused to cooperate for the committee, and became known as the Hollywood 10. The 11th, Bertolt Brecht, denied membership in the Communist Party, left the caucus room and then the country. All but one of the 10 were members of the Screenwriters Guild, which Chairman Thomas had earlier contended was lousy with communists. - The committee had obtained a number of Communist Party cards, identifying the Hollywood 10 as being members of the Communist Party. A chief investigator for the committee, Louis Russell, a former FBI agent, presented these in evidence at the hearing regarding these 10 individuals. - [Interviewer] Now did these cards actually have the names of the 10 on them? - No. The cards themselves had aliases on 'em, and accompanying the cards we obtained a master code sheet, and like say one card would have the name John Doe on it. Well, the code sheet would reveal, which was kept in Communist Party headquarters that this was actually Dalton Trumbo, or someone other involved in the Hollywood 10. - The Hollywood 10. I don't know how they selected them. They must have had used a...you know, they must've drawn them out of a hat... because uh... some of them were very dear friends... years standing, and some were comparitively new acquaintances. Some, as in any 10, were... very fond of each other, and others as in any group of men were not so fond of each other. They were united by... by the common political purpose which had brought them together. - When we got together with attorneys, the attorneys pointed something out to us that was of crucial importance. Namely, that the composition of the Supreme Court was such that if there were any people who were willing to test the constitutionality of the law that had created this committee, that group was likely to win, and therefore the committee would be abolished by the courts, and... we had not asked for our subpoenas, but having been given them, and having been commanded to go to Washington to testify, we took a common decision that we would oppose this committee, and that we would try and destroy it legally in the courts. But the only way we could do that was to take a position on the First Amendment and if the committee asked us any questions that we felt were in violation of the First Amendment of the Constitution, we would refuse to answer them. - Someone suggested at that time that we should also take the Fifth Amendment but we rejected this. We felt that this was not a time for that, that we had done nothing wrong, that we were guilty of nothing, and this was an opportunity really, to clear away the anti-semitism which had come. The Cold War atmosphere which was growing so fast; we had a real mission at this point, and we felt confident that we could make it because...there's no question about, in anybody's mind, there wasn't then, and there isn't now in my mind, that our stand was justified, we were guilty of nothing, and this was a position that we had to take. - We had originally bound ourselves to... the unanimity rule, and...they didn't want us to testify. - [Interviewer] You mean, you would all take the same... - We would all take the same stand or that we would all agree. This is an odd rule, but it happens in these kind of cases and these kind of organizations, where the decision must be unanimous. If one person is against it, everything goes, so it's not the rule of the majority by any means, and... of course, they didn't want us to do that. They didn't want us to testify because it would break the front, and at that time I wasn't a communist, and I had gotten out of the party, and Adrian had too at the time. But we were with the people, we didn't want to break the front, and so we... kept to the rules. - The men were all interested in saving their careers if they could. They were interested in making this a political issue around which they could get the support of the industry and the people generally, and it was felt that they had the best chance of saving their careers, and of making this a political issue that people would support by relying on the First Amendment. So, for all of these reasons, but primarily because their objective was to destroy the committee it was decided to rely on the First Amendment. One last thing; It was believed at that time that they could win. - [Narrator] The morale of the Hollywood 10 was high as they came to Washington to face the committee. From within the film industry, came a support group, the Committee for the First Amendment. Fearing censorship and witch hunting, celebrities such as Humphrey Bogart, Lauren Bacall and Danny Kaye traveled to Washington to monitor the hearings and make public their support to the position of the Hollywood 10. Attorneys Robert Kenney and Bartley Crum explained that position to the house committee. - We think two additional evidences of the illegality of this committee came up. One, in attempts by members of the committee to dictate to various producers the content of films that are to be produced, and second, then effort indicated by questioning to induce the motion picture producers to create a blacklist to hire men not on the basis of ability, but on the basis of political belief. Now both of these, we say, indicate an unconstitutional purpose. The purpose to invade the domain protected by the First Amendment which is the provision that Congress shall pass no law invading the freedom of speech or conscience. The committee has this opportunity at this time to consider the basic constitutional principles under which it is proceeding, and I think it would be the first time that this committee ever has done that, and I think that if we are given that opportunity, the committee might well rule with this, if they can hear our arguments out and give them full consideration. - [Thomas] This is the unanimous decision of this sub-committee. No committee of Congress has the right the right to establish its own legality or constitutionality. A committee of Congress cannot disqualify itself, from the provisions of the law. We operate under public law 601. We cannot set aside this law to suit the convenience of certain witnesses or their council. As a former Attorney General of the state of California, you certainly know that your remedy, if any, is in the courts. Mr. Stripling, the next witness. (gavel banging) - Mr. John Howard Lawson. - [Crum] Mr. Chairman, may we request the right of cross examination; we ask you to bring back, and permit us to cross examine the witnesses Adolphe Menjou, Fred Niblo, John Charles Moffitt, Richard MacAulay, Rupert Hughes, Sam Wood and James Cain McInnis... - [Thomas] I can...you don't have to name any more. That request is denied. That request... - In order to show that these witnesses lie! - [Thomas] That request is denied! Mr. Stripling, the first witness. - [Stripling] John Howard Lawson. - The question of communism is in no way related to this inquiry, which is an attempt to get control of the screen and to invade the basic rights of American... - [Stripling] Mr. Chairman, Mr. Chairman... - The question here relates not only to the question of my membership in any political organization, but this committee is attempting to establish the right, (gavel banging) which is historically denied to any committee of this sort. To invade the rights and privledges of the communities of American citizens, whether they be Protestant or Methodist or Jewish or Catholic. In order that you can then smear the motion picture industry and you can proceed from that to the press to any form of communication in this country. - [Thomas] You have learned your lines well! - The Bill of Rights was established precisely to prevent the operation of any committee which could invade the basic rights of Americans. Now, if you want to know... - [Stripling] Mr. Chairman, the witness is not answering the question I submitted. - If you want to know about the perjury that has been committed here, and the perjury that is planned, you permit us to cross examine these witnesses... (banging gavel) (commotion) - [Thomas] We're gonna get the answer to that question if we have to stay here for a week. Are you a member of the Communist Party, or have you ever been a member of the Communist Party? - It's unfortunate and tragic that I have to teach this committee the basic principles of Americanism. - That's not the question! (gavel banging) That's not the question! The question is have you ever been a member of the Communist Party? - I'm framing my answer in the only way in which any American citizen can frame his answer... - Then you deny! - to your question which invades his... Absolutely invade his rights. - [Thomas] Then you deny...you refuse to answer that question, is that correct? - I have told you that I will offer my beliefs... - Alright... (gavel banging) Excuse the witness! - ...to the American public, and they will know where I stand as they do from what I have written. - [Thomas] Stand away from the stand! - I have written for Americanism for many years... - Stand away from the stand! -...fight for the Bill of Rights which you are trying to destroy. - Get this man away from the stand. (gavel banging) (excited, indistinct chatter) (chatter and commotion) There will be no demonstrations! John Howard Lawson refused to answer the question: "Are you a member of the Communist Party, or have you ever been a member of the Communist Party," and other questions. He is attempting to thwart the hearings and investigations of this committee. Therefore, it is the unanimous opinion of this sub-committee that John Howard Lawson is in contempt of Congress. (loud bang) Excuse the witness. - [Stripling] No, no... Just a moment, Mr. Chairman. Just a moment. I have other questions which I... - [Trumbo] Am I excused? - No..no he isn't. - [Thomas] This is just another excuse to keep the investigation-- [Stripling] Just a moment. I have some other questions, Mr. Trumbo, I would like to ask you. Are you now or have you ever been a member of the Communist Party? - Mr. Chairman, first I a member of tshould like to know - Mr. Chairman, first I should like to know whether the quality of my last answer was acceptable, since I am still on the stand. - This has nothing to do with your last answer to the last question. This is a new question. - I see... Mr. Stripling, you must have some reason for asking me this question. - You can address the committee. - I understand that members of the press have been given an alleged Communist Party card belonging to me, is that true? - No, that's not true. (gavel banging hard) - [Thomas] You're not asking the question! - [Trumbo] I was! - The chief investigator is asking the question! - I beg your pardon, sir. - [Thomas] Are you or have you ever been a member of the Communist Party? - I believe I have the right to be confronted with any evidence which supports this question. I should like to see what you have. - Oh, you would? - Yes. - Well, you will pretty soon! (crowd laughter) (crowd laughter) - Now Mr. Maltz, are you a member of the Communist Party? - Next you are going to ask what my religious beliefs are, and you are going to insist before various members of the industry that since you don't like my religious beliefs, I should not work in that industry. - Now Mr. Maltz... - Any such question is quite irrelevant to the course of this committee's investigation. - Now Mr. Maltz, I'll repeat the question. Are you now or have you ever been a member of the Communist Party? - I have answered the question, Mr. Quisling. I am sorry. - Have you ever been a member of the Communist Party? - Mr. Stripling and gentlemen of the committee, unless it has been changed since yesterday, in our country we have a secret ballot, and I do not believe this committee has any more right to inquire into my political affiliations than I believe that an election official has the right to go into the voting booth and examine the ballot which has been marked by the voter. - [Stripling] Are you a member of the Screenwriters Guild? - I wish to reply to that question by saying that this involves a serious question of conscience for me. - [Thomas] Conscience? - Conscience, sir. - [ThoConscience.ence? - Conscience, sir. Conscience. Kindly, let me answer the question. I am asking this as a citizen and taxpayer of representatives of my government to let me answer the question conscientiously. I say you do raise a serious question of conscience for me when you ask me to act in concert with you to override the Constitution. - I had been advised that there's a question of constitutional rights involved here. The Constitution does not ask that I, that such a question be answered in the way that Mr. Stripling wants it answered. I think that what organizations I belong to, what I think, even what I say, cannot be questioned by this committee. - [Stripling] Then you refuse to answer the question. - I do not refuse to answer, I answered it in my own way. I do not think you... - ...whether or not you are a member of the Communist Party, or whether... - I was just saying... I do not think you have the right under the Constitution to ask me such a question. - [Stripling] Mr. Chairman, it's apparent that the witness is pursuing the same line as the other witnesses and... - [Stripling] Mr. Scott, could you tell the committee of whether or not you are now or have ever been a member of the Communist Party? - Mr. Stripling, that question is designed to inquire into my personal and private life. I don't think it is pertinent to this... I don't think it's a proper question either. - Do you decline to answer the question, Mr. Scott? - I believe that question also invades my rights as a citizen. I believe it also invades the First Amendment. I believe that I should not engage in any conspiracy with you to invade the First Amendment. - Mr. Lardner, the charge has been made... before this committee that... the Screenwriters Guild, which, according to the records, you are a member, whether you admit it or not, had a number of individuals in it who are members of the Communist Party. who are members of the Communist Party. - You're trying to discredit the Screenwriters Guild through me and the motion picture industry through the Screenwriters Guild and the whole practice of freedom of expression. - [Stripling] Whether you and others are members of the Communist Party-- You are the ones who are discrediting the Screenwriters Guild. - [Thomas] You're an American, aren't you? - Yes, I certainly am. - Well then, an American oughta be very proud to answer that question. - I'm very proud to answer the question, and I will at times when I feel it proper. - It'd be very easy to answer too. - It's very simple to answer the question, and the times when I feel it's proper, I will, but when I wish to stand on my rights of association. No sir, I feel that I must determine as well. - [Thomas] We'll determine when it's proper; you're excused. (gavel banging) Next question, Mr. Stripling. - [Stripling] Mr. Biberman...are you a member of the Screenwriters Guild or have you ever been a member of the Screenwriters Guild? - Now, Mr. Stripling, I would like to reply to this very quietly. Mr. Chairman also... If I will not be interrupted, I will attempt to give you a full answer to this question. It has become very clear to me that the real purpose of this investigation... - That is not the question!

You must answer the question! (Biberman yelling into the mic) You're excused! -...chaos in the industry... - [Stripling] Will you direct the witness to answer that question, Mr. Chairman, before he leaves his stand? - I have not refused to answer the question. I told you before I will answer this question fully. - Now, Mr. Biberman, technically... - Your purpose is to use this to disrupt the motion picture industry to invade the right not only of me, but of the producers, to their thoughts, to their opinions, and this I will not permit!

The meeting was called by Eric Johnston, head of the Motion Picture Association, to decide what to do about the Hollywood 10. - We will forthwith discharge or suspend without compensation those in our employ, and we will not re-employ any of the 10 until such time as he has acquitted or has purged himself of contempt, and declares under oath that he is not a communist. We will not knowingly employ a communist or a member of any party, or group which advocates the overthrow of the government of the United States by force, or by any illegal or unconstitutional methods. We request Congress to enact legislation to assist American industry, to rid itself of subversive, disloyal elements. Nothing subversive or Un-American Nothing subversive has appeared on the screen. has appeared on the screen. - [voice of Lardner] As soon as they made up their minds on a clear-cut policy, which was a reversal of the policy we had been assured of in Washington by Eric Johnston himself; that is that they would never permit a blacklist. As soon as they decided there should be a blacklist, and starting with the 10 of us, support began to fall away. I don't know what pressures were, how direct the pressure were that were exerted on various...actors and directors and so on in the industry, but...they could pretty well see it without anybody... saying it directly to them; that their own careers were threatened by any open defiance of the official position. See, up until that meeting we were able to at least think of it as a fight of the movie business against this investigating committee, but...as of that day in November, it became the committee plus the controlling bodies of the movie companies against us and people who supported us, and all the people in the middle...felt...pressured to take a stand one way or the other and most of them... took the stand of supporting the studio position or just remaining silent. I'd been...aware that the ax was about to fall, although I'd been told that Darryl Zanuck had said he would not execute this Waldorf resolution had said he woulunless he was specifically instructed to unless he was specifically instructed to by the 20th Century Fox board of directors. He didn't accept the executive meeting...at the Waldorf. But meanwhile the 20th Century Fox board of directors obliged them. They had given me and asked me to undertake a new assignment after the hearings, and it was with Otto Preminger, and we were discussing the story that I'd been working on for 10 days or something in his office. - And my secretary came in and said Mr. Zanuck who was the head of the studio, wants to see Mr. Lardner, and I assumed it was about the film. I said, "and me?" she said "No, only Mr. Lardner." Lardner left, and three minutes later he came back and said "I've just been fired." And he feared; it is very difficult to even remember this now, to realize it; that particularly in Hollywood the fear was so terrible that when I went out with Mr. and Mrs. Lardner to dinner, to a restaurant, I was called by several friends the next day said "if you have to seem them, don't go to a restaurant, don't go out in public." - [Interviewer] Was there any time between 1947 and the time that you went to jail that you wished you hadn't taken the position that you did? - No. No. I don't recollect ever...regretting it or even seriously considering what... else I could have done. - [Dmytryk] I was...disillusiond is the common word, long before I went to prison. Not immediately I must say, but...well, I was. I think it started, actually... with John Howard Lawson's... I'm sorry. I think it started with John Howard Lawson's appearance on the stand. I realized then that our cause was lost. The minute I saw his attitude, I said, "we're dead." As a matter of fact, Dore Schary was sitting alongside of me in the audience, and I said "we're dead," and that's exactly the way I felt about it. But it took a long time for me to put everything together, but I had put it together long before I went to prison. However, I knew that if I suddenly recanted and said I want to purge myself or I'm not with them any longer in spirit or in principle or in anything else, people would have said he's afraid of going to jail, and he's doing it simply because he's a coward and doesn't want to go to jail. So, I knew I had to go to jail, at least show them that wasn't what was motivating me, and which I did. - The penalty that we might suffer if we lost was one year, and that did not seem like such an extreme chance to take in view of the fact that in the analysis of our attorneys we would win the case, because they felt that the supreme court as constituted at that time would support our position by a five to four or a better majority. - We did not foresee... what was going to happen. As the Cold War developed we did not foresee the fact that before the case got to the Supreme Court, two of the liberal justices died... and were replaced by very conservative justices, so, actually at the time that this position was taken, it was realistic to say that we could reasonably expect to win. - If we had won...I think there would have been no such thing as the so-called McCarthy era, because McCarthy's committee and the other committees of the Senate behaved in precisely the same way as the House committee, and they existed on this basis of the same type of legislation, so that if we had destroyed one, McCarthy never would have been able to operate the way he did. Now, we would not have changed the Cold War, which was the political background within which all of these committees were operating, but we would have killed the ability of these committees to summon people up before them, to have false accusations made against them in many instances, or to ask them a question and not allow them to answer anything but yes or no, and then to use the weapon of job blacklist. - Contempt was recommended by the committee, it was voted by the House... tried before a judge and jury... and we were convicted. Only two people stood trial. Jack Lawson... stood trial first, and then I. The other eight... for one thing because of money, and for another thing because of time. Stipulated that the result... of our cases would... ...apply to them also. Both Jack and I were judged guilty of contempt of the eighty... third Congress, I think it was... and as far I... was concerned it was a completely just verdict. I... I had contempt for that Congress and... I've had contempt for several since, and on the basis of guilt or innocence, I really could never complain very much... that this was a crime... or a misdemeanor was the... was the complaint, my complaint. - We don't like the idea of going to prison. Our personal lives, our families, our work are as important to us as to anyone else. To explain to a child, of 7, 10, or 12 why his father must go to prison... No, it's not easy. - Why didn't we avoid all this? Why didn't we answer the questions yes or no as the committee demanded? Because we wanted to challenge the right of the committee to ask such questions. - Whose words are these, you know? No official, high or petty, may prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, or other matters of opinion or force citizens to confess by word or act their faith, therein. Supreme Court Justice Jackson wrote this. This was the law of the land until April 10th, 1950. - On that day, by its refusal to hear our case, the court washed its hands of the rights of the American people. Our rights, your rights. And sitting in silence on the bench was the same Mr. Justice Jackson. - When we appeared before J. Parnell Thomas and his committee, we thought the Constitution guaranteed the rights of everyone. We believed the Supreme Court would certainly stand behind its own decisions. Well, we were mistaken. - The committee...is now free to operate. To drag before it a thousand people, or the million it boasts it has on its lists. - How are you going to answer the committee's questions? - You can't refuse to answer yes or no; that's contempt. It means a prison sentence for you just as it does for us. - Suppose you answer yes... how it looks smeared all over the front pages of your hometown newspaper? And what will happen to your job? - But that's not all. You answer "yes, I was at such-and-such a meeting." "Oh yes, I'm a member of that organization." - Is that the end? The next question is who else was there? Who else is a member? We want names, places, people. You want to keep out of trouble? Then become a stool-pigeon. - Yes, government by stool pigeon. - Everybody investigating everybody else. And for this, on April 24th, 1950, President Truman claimed credit. - Boasting in a public speech that his administration had convicted citizens of contempt for refusing to testify before congressional committees. - In 1859, Abraham Lincoln said, "for people are the rightful masters "of the congresses and the courts." - We believe this, and for asserting that belief before a congressional committee 10 of us are going to prison. Casualties of the Cold War. How many more will there be? - There need be no more. That depends on you. Truly, it depends on you. - [Trumbo] We thought we'd win. Every law review in the country thought we would win. The best lawyers in the country thought we would win. Now... we didn't win. Others saw something that we had not had the advantage of seeing. They saw 10 men sell their houses, say goodbye to their kids, and go off to jail. Lose their jobs... theoretically, permanently, and go off to jail. And, and be subjected to public disgrace and punishment. - [Interviewer] Do you think you would have done differently if you knew it was going to turn out that way? - I don't know. And I don't think that anyone knows. God knows it's hard enough for me to predict what I'm going to do... you know, in an ordinary event, in the ordinary course, circumstances. I hope I wouldn't have. And I think probably, I think probably... I would not have, but I really can't say more than probably, because you don't know. I had three children. I had a nice wife. Why should I go to jail? But...200 other people...knew what was going to happen. And the man knocked on the door and you got that pink slip... but the first thing you did was... go out and try to sell your house before anybody discovers, so you at least get a fair price for it or as fair as possible. Don't let anybody know. Keep it quiet. Get as much work as you can in before it's public, becomes public. Save every penny you have. Sell what assets you have and get ready... to become...nobody. ♪ (dramatic music) - [Narrator] 1951. The House Committee on Un-American Activities prepared for a new round of Washington hearings. J.

The New Jersey Republican was tried and convicted, and sent to the federal prison of Danbury, Connecticut where his fellow inmates included Ring Lardner Jr. and Lester Cole, two of the Hollywood 10. By the end of 1950, Congress had passed McCarran Internal Security Act, requiring registration of all communist and left-wing organizations.

We are hopeful, that through and as a result of the hearings of your committee, ways and means will be provided, which will enable the nation to fairly, legally, and effectively deal with the problems of communists or subversive elements... - [Narrator] On March 21st, 1951, with the Hollywood 10 still in prison, actor Larry Parks became the first former Hollywood communist to cooperate with the House Committee on Un-American Activities - [Parks] In 1941, being a member of the Communist Party fulfilled certain needs of young men that was liberal in thought who was for the underprivileged, the underdog. My career has been ruined because of this... don't present me with the choice of either being in contempt of this committee and going to jail or forcing me to crawl through the mud to be an informer. I beg you... not to force me to do this. - [Narrator] Fearing job blacklisting, Parks admitted party membership and reluctantly named names. His film career was over. Actors Howard Da Silva and Gale Sondergaard followed Parks to the witness stand and stood on their 5th Amendment rights. Their careers also came to a sudden halt. - We had searched through our files of people who had been active in the so-called left-wing movement both in front organizations and also in the Communist Party. And dossiers were made on all these people and then we talked to people in Hollywood who had knowledge, personal knowledge of these individuals and their activities. And particularly in union meetings and other types of meetings, fundraising meetings and so on and so forth, and in talking to these people personally they could almost pinpoint who was not active anymore. And also, give you a good verbal account of what their activity was in unions if they weren't participating with the Communist Party group. And so on the basis of that...a number of subpoenas were issued on... to bring these people before the committee to ascertain membership in the Communist Party. - [Interviewer] Were you a membr of the Communist Party? - Well, it is a very interesting question. Howard Sherman was a very dear friend of mine, an actor, and we were both members of Actor's Equity Association and during the time when all this difficulty occurred people were throwing all kinds of accusations and things and reactionary people in an equity meeting once hurled an accusation at lovely chubby Sherman, Howard Sherman. They said "Are you now or have you ever been a member of the Communist Party" And Chubby thought for a moment, and then he said "We're not allowed to tell." (chuckles) I remember that as being the most wildest answer to that. My answer? The Bill of Rights commands me to reserve that information as part of my own principle position. If I wish to disclose it, to disclose it, if I don't, not to. I believe that in order to preserve the Bill of Rights you have to maintain it. - ...and one morning... my young son, what was he then, four, five, something like that, came up, running up the front steps of our house and he says "Mom, somebody wants to see you." So I came down the steps and here was this man... well, I don't think I'll attempt to describe him but he had a piece of pink paper and he said Ms. Sondergaard this is for you. And this was MY subpoena. Their father is just out of jail. There was no point in a mother leaving the small children also to go to jail but it seemed to me sensible, for me now to be allowed to stay at home with my children. And, I felt that I would rather invoke the 5th Amendment, which was a protection, anybody can, it's not... it has no onus upon it at all, as we all know. - [Narrator] Over the next five years, hundreds of witnesses were subpoenaed. Many refused to cooperate, including actors Will Geer and Zero Mostel, and writers Lillian Hellman and Arthur Miller. Many others cooperated with the committee, among them director Elia Kazan, actor Lloyd Bridges, writers Budd Schulberg and Clifford Odets, and director Edward Dmytryk, one of the original Hollywood 10. And so began the era of the blacklist. And so began the era - Along with other people, - Along with other people, I signed the Stockholm peace appeal. I believe in peace as everybody does. I at least hope that they were sincere. However, the Korean war made me realize that they were not. Any intelligent man knew that the North Koreans would not attack South Korea, would not be aggressors unless they had the backing of very strong forces behind them. - In my own way I tried what Larry Parks tried, unsuccessfully in front of Congress. I made statements that I had been a communist, I was no longer a communist, I was no longer sympathetic with communist...ideology, as it were, all their aims, and hoped this would enable me to get a job. It didn't. Being originally Canadian it would have been very simple thing for me to renounce my American citizenship. My family is, however, American. They love it here, I love it here! I love this country. I didn't want to be a martyr for a cause I didn't believe in, number one. And number two, as I say, I wanted to work here rather than work in Europe, where I could have with great success. - In the first place I have never heard the 447, anybody say that they would refuse to fight for this country in a war against Soviet Russia.

There are no positive values, no eternal principles of right and wrong. Actually it is the old doctrine of atheism, sugar coated with high-brow terms.

Wood, now chairman of the committee, moved the hearings from Washington back to Hollywood. (indistinct chatter) One of the first witnesses called to these public sessions was screenwriter Leo Townsend. - When did you first come out to California? - I came out here in 1935. I was sent out by a Dell publishing company to...be the Hollywood editor of one of their magazines, it was a fan magazine called Modern Screen. In those days the fan magazines weren't as trashy as they are now. I was brought up very strict Irish Catholic. After I went to college, I drifted away from the church. Somewhere in it I wanted to get back into some kind of an organization that had rules and it might have subconsciously been part of the reason I joined. After I was in the party, what I found was that it was much stricter than the church and I realized I got back into what I had left. And that started my thinking about going out. I thought...since I knew the evils of this party, who better to talk to than an arm of our government? That... I didn't know where else to go. And then finally, in 1950, I called the FBI. They told me that the House committee would be coming out, that I would undoubtedly be tapped, and I said, well, I'll volunteer. I was called by a Mr. Bill Wheeler, who was the investigator for the committee, and gave me an opportunity to do whatever I wanted, to take the 5th Amendment or refuse to cooperate, whatever, and I said no, I had thought the thing through and as I told you earlier, my reasons, and I was willing to... to, I thought I was... I... In my mind I was doing it out of the vigilance of my conscience. - Right. Can you tell us why you named so many people? - They, uh... knew every person I was associated with in the party, and said "Therefore, you can't name some and not name the others." And I said, "But you have them all," and again they said it was a legality that if you're going to name the people you must name all the ones we knew you were associated with. - [Interviewer] Did you feel at all that the people you named were all dangerous people? - No. I'm sure some are no more dangerous than I was, but I imagine within that whole group there might have been five or six people who were in a crisis... might... be influenced because of their membership in the party to commit an act, possibly not of violence, but an act against our country. I'd say five or six but... I would have no idea who those five or six might be, except I knew that I wouldn't be one of them.

And I did get a job, finally, in San Francisco, when I managed to bounce by accident into a job at the Hungry Eye and... they needed a light man and off-stage announcer and...stage manager. I worked there for seven and a half years. It would have been an ideal job for a writer if they had paid a decent salary. But the man paid 80 dollars a week. I got up all the way to 105 dollars, I think, after 7 years there. But, that's why I had a daytime job reviewing movies for the People's World here which paid another 50 or 60 dollars a week, because I had this daughter to support still. - Yeah I took a job with the King Brothers for about 5,000 dollars to make a picture for them... just in order to prove that the American Legion wouldn't boycott my pictures as they had done during the years that I wasn't allowed to work in Hollywood, and that the American public in general wouldn't rise and react to the fact that I was working in town again.

But I worked in New York as a waiter, as a warehouse man. I did all kinds of odd jobs to keep going. - We had formed a thing called the Motion Picture Industry Council. It was dedicated to the public relations of the picture industry. Not public publicity, but to deal with those problems that affected the industry as a whole. It consisted of representatives of every organization, every management group in pictures.

Well, the average person would say "Good Lord, I joined because of this or that", whatever the proposed or purported cause was, and they say, "What do I do?"

And my policy is that I...modestly... refuse either to confirm or to deny. And in this way, I receive just a little bit of credit from almost every good picture that's made and, for some reason, I never get blamed for the scamps. - Scamps? - Oh, you might call turkey. - Aside from any specific titles, then, have you written for motion pictures? Are you writing now? - You mean since the blacklist ...was inaugurated in Hollywood? Oh yes, yes. - You talk about the blacklist growing out of the 1947 hearings before the Un-American Activities Committee. Is it that formalized? A blacklist with names on it, people who will not be employed? - The studios say there is no blacklist at all. It's a dirty word with them. However, over 250 people have received notices from the studios that they are not longer employable in motion pictures, and I was one of the first. I think it's a blacklist. - Mr. Wheeler, was there in fact a blacklist, to your knowledge? - Oh. Not as such, I don't know anybody that typed out a list of names and circulated them around the studios and said these are the people not to be hired. I mean this would be against federal legislation, this would be conspiracy to keep people from becoming employed. - And there was definitely a blacklist in Hollywood, no question about it. I remember when I came back and finally was working again at Columbia. I wanted to use a man as a dialogue director. His name had to go through the channels, and they came back to me and said sorry you can't use him and I said why not? And they said, well, he was not a member of the Communist Party as far as we know and we don't know but he had his names on a few things that were questionable so it would be just safer not to. Now I think that's reprehensible, and there was nothing I could do to fight it. There's just I don't know how many, not as many as they say, but there were hundreds of people at least who were affected by the blacklist and who lost their means of livelihood in this town. Most of whom are back, who are still alive, back working again, by the way, and are, as it were, in favor. I think there is a reverse blacklist even today now. I think that the liberals who are riding high are going in the opposite direction. I think some of the fellows back then who were on the reactionary side are having a tough time getting jobs now. - The blacklist you so often hear about in following the Waldorf meeting... this did not stem from Hollywood. This stemmed from the American people. They had gotten ahead of Hollywood, and suddenly when millions of Americans in various types of groups simply had lists of performers or people in the picture business and said look, we're gonna tell you this we're not gonna pay money to buy tickets to see a picture...that is paying a good living, a better living than we make, to people that we believe are dedicated to the overthrow of this country. Well now, if you're in the picture business and you're a producer and you're going to invest a few million dollars in the picture, and you've got great and nationwide organizations saying we won't buy tickets to see it, you got a little selective with who you put in it. - We always thought that this blacklist didn't exist, and then it turned out that every company started to put in their contracts, also United Artists, that did Exodus had in their contract that the legal department has to approve the writers and the actors, and whomever you wanted to hire. And why the legal department? If you would say that they had some artistic reasons against an actor or writer they could discuss it although I have already been, they now have to compete in front of me. I can hire whomever I want, et cetera. Anyway, I hired Mr. Trumbo. - So, we went to work. And he was reading his copy and walking back and forth and he say, "No... there is something not...not quite right here. I mean it does not have your flair. It...doesn't have genius, that's what I mean. It just, somehow...lacks genius that the other scenes have. And we must have that genius." And I said "Otto... for God's sake... if we have every scene... equally excellent... do you realize how monotonous this picture is going to be? It will be impossible to sit through. There must be variety, and that's the reason I made this scene this way." He said, "Oh...", paced one more time back, looked at it, he said "Tell you what... You make them all excellent, and then I will direct unevenly." (laughing) - I had lunch with Mr. Clement Benjamin of United Artists, and I took them to lunch at Saint Regis, and said that I want to give Trumbo credit, you know, official screen credit as Dalton Trumbo, and they said to me, "Look..." and it was very much to their credit, "We won't stop you. We have nothing, we cannot do, you have autonomy of contract. If you want to... give him screen credit, we won't...publicly agree with you for certain reasons, but we will not stop you, do whatever you like." - Otto would say occasionally, "Now look, I must have better scenes or I'm going to announce that you wrote this! That's what I'll do!" I received a call from him one night and he said "Did you get the New York Times" -the story broke on page one- "that you wrote Exodus?" I said, "That means you really hate the script doesn't it?" (laughs) - Trumbo was probably... the, one of the most prominent film writers in Hollywood. Man of enormous prestige with great credits, and I knew that as the blacklist back in before the Un-American Activities Committee, back in the old days, that there would be people who would break it as they did with Trumbo in 1960. And this was an individual action on the part of a producer. It generally relaxed things at that time, but it wasn't a common thing. Other people didn't get back until much much later. - In New York the winner is Millard Lampell. - [Announcer] Eagle in a CageHallmark Hall of Fame. ♪ (applause) - Uh, you know, this is kind of ironic because the only reason I became a writer was because you could wear a sweater all the time. (audience laughing) I'd like to thank George Shay for not, because he's such a good director but because he was so easy to get along with. No, because he works out of the script, and... (audience laughing) This is my last remark. (audience laughing) For some peculiar reason, and its gonna take me a long time to figure out why, I suppose everybody ought to know here that I was blacklisted for 10 years. - I didn't even know I was going to say it. I had no idea. - Thank you. (audience applauding) I had my name, suddenly it seemed ridiculous to be standing here with all these people and acting as though nothing had happened in those 10 years. The place went crazy. Everybody began to applaud and cheer and whistle. Because it was now getting to be fashionable to say "I didn't really mean it." It's a hard thing to see lives destroyed because of a false idea. I just think it's a sad thing. It's like Vietnam, and maybe with the beginning of it, when the country is bit by bit manipulated by a mood, by a feeling so that they lose sight of what the kind of spirit of independence and originality is. Everytime people are afraid of a new idea, every time people are afraid of someone who's outspoken, there's the potential for what ends in a blacklist. - People are out to protect themselves. The people who have property and money, and those were the people who formed the alliance, let's say... want to protect their property and their money. They want security, obviously. To them communism was a great danger because I've heard communists themselves say... I'll never forget one guy who stood in front of the Sunset Towers, and said to me, "Someday I'm going to be living up there and he's going to be living down here." Well, that's a kind of thing that the Hedda Hoppers and the John Waynes and the Ward Bonds heard and believed. Whether they're justified or not I don't know. - I sort of go back a long way to where I started as a young man. I took a side, and I knew there was an opposite side. I remember there was an old song called Which Side are You On? Well, I knew which side I was on, and there was never any doubt about it, and there was people on the other side and they were going to try to suppress us, all our democratic rights, all our rights of free speech, and... so that when it happened I think I was pretty well prepared for it because as the Cold War developed after Churchill's speech in Fulton, Missouri in 1946 it seemed pretty clear. The un-American activities committee had a new spurt of life at that time. The people in Hollywood, of the Hollywood Alliance, grabbed onto this thing and it became a big hullabaloo and it was they who invited the committee out. - It was a confused time, but I don't think there is any blaming that can be assessed against anyone. First of all, the American people, they came out of a war in which the Soviet Union was our ally. Came out of what we thought was a time of peace, and then suddenly, the Cold War started and they suddenly saw that the one-time ally was behaving in a manner that had to be construed as hostile to us. And I think all we wanted was peace. I know a lot of young people had been led to believe by some that...communism or that America is aggressive and imperialistic and I've always had one answer for them. When World War II ended, and the whole world was war-ravaged and destroyed, we were the only country with the full industrial power unharmed by the enemy. We had the greatest military organization the world had ever seen, and we had THE bomb... and no one else had it. Now, if we were imperialistic and aggressive, why didn't we take over the world? - Worse than the suffering that any individuals may have had because of the blacklist and some who died, as we know, was the damage that was done to our country, and the damage that was done internationally as a result of what was going on in our country. And this committee, and committees like it such as the McCarthy committee, were advancing on the fascist front, and those who... did not oppose it, whether in silence, out of fear, or who cooperated with it, were helping that advance. - The only way you could cooperate with the committee was to inform, and in no country that I've read the literature, where I've read the literature, can I find an informer is a hero, but yet in this country they tried to make a stool-pigeon a hero. It doesn't work. And, the only reason one informs is the old cliche in the movie where the British soldier shoves, with his riding crop, the money towards the informer, And that's what all of them did who informed. They got a little money shoved their way. So...either we're all victims in a sense. All right, if you want to go around your lifetime with the... with the word "informer" written on your forehead, fine. Also, people have very short memories. They forget who they are, but I won't forget. - I have the feeling... that if you give... most people in the world... the choice between enough food for their children and shelter and clothing in return for their freedom of speech, that they that they will go for the food, the shelter, and the necessities and... freedom of speech... becomes a luxury for... for which... few fight at the most. Men want food, and they want houses and they wouldn't mind an automobile. If that means that I have to go to jail, they don't care. Let him go. - [Narrator] Although Dalton Trumbo's screen credit on Exodusin 1960 appeared to signal the end of the blacklist, years went by before others regained employment. Some were never to return to the film industry. Some decided to leave the country rather than wait for change in the political climate. The effects of the blacklist are still being felt by the people who lived through it, and by the succeeding generation. Even today, government positions have been denied to children of blacklisted parents. In 1975, many people were still reluctant to talk about this period, and many would not appear in this film fearing they might jeopardize their careers ♪ ("Which Side Are You On" plays) ♪ Come all of you good workers ♪ Good news to you I'll tell ♪ Of how the good old union ♪ Has come in here to dwell ♪ Which side are you on, which side are you on? ♪ My Daddy was a miner and I'm a miner's son ♪ And I'll stick with a union ♪ 'Til every battle's won ♪ Which side are you on, which side are you on? ♪ They say in Harlan County there are no neutrals there ♪ You'll either be a union man ♪ Or a thug for J.H.
