(tense music) - [Man] I believe in the sun even when it's not shining. I believe in love even when I do not experience it. I believe in God even when he is silent. My name is Dion Cominos. I believe in courage. The courage to care. (urgent music) It was ordinary people like you and I that saved others from the Nazi holocaust of World War II. They did not know they would be called heroes. They did not know their legacy would live on and be an inspiration for us all. As you watch this documentary, let us try and understand how when so many voices cried out for help, so few answered. We dedicate this film to the ones that did. (somber music) (singing in foreign language) - This is the story of perhaps the least honored of war heroes and heroines, those heroic individuals who risked their own lives to rescue Jews from the Nazi genocide during World War II. For over half a century, the experiences of many holocaust survivors and their rescuers were not spoken of. Mostly for the want of a normal life for themselves and their families. These are the possessions of Victor Schwartz. Many years have passed since the holocaust. However, to one of Victor's childhood friends, as with the many friends of victims, the memories are as vivid as yesterday's. Victor's belongings, remnants of a friendship shared help a friend reminisce as he lights a candle on the anniversary of Victor's death. Victor became another of Hitler's victims. No one was able to warn him of the impending danger on that fateful day that Nazis arrived at his doorstep. When Hitler marched across Europe and unleashed his campaign of terror and persecution of the Jewish people, over six million Jews perished. For them, rescue never came. Victor Schwartz, on arriving home from school that afternoon in April 1944 was confronted by Nazis. He was told he was to be taken on a journey. He asked his neighbor to look after his book, his prized tin car and his school satchel. Victor said he would come back to collect them. He never returned. Victor, age eight was transported to Auschchwitz and murdered. In the German plans for the Jewish annihilation, children became special targets. The pre-war European Jewish child population came to approximately 1.6 million. During the war, 1.5 million Jewish children were killed. There were thousands of piles of children's shoes like this left outside gas chambers never to be reclaimed by their young owners. Some toddlers and babies were killed in the arms of their mothers and family members. Others went to their deaths without the comfort of loving relatives and friends to hold them. It's easy to desensitize ourselves to such difficult images as these. But these dark images depict experiences of real people in our past. These images help us understand a dark chapter in our history. So that we may prevent it from happening again. History does repeat itself. It's only when we lose someone truly precious, someone that lights up their life like their own child, that we begin to understand the agony of the holocaust survivors. (somber music) It was desperately courageous to rescue Jews because of the fiercely anti-Jewish environment of Nazi-occupied Europe. Rescuing Jews involved providing food and shelter, sometimes for years. Fear and danger of living through war prevailed. Strict curfews had to be adhered to. Food rations were meager and acquiring extra food was looked at suspiciously. German army officers bullied men, women, and children frequently for information on Jews. Homes and workplaces were stormed regularly. On 15th October 1941, the Germans introduced a law that made the protection of Jews punishable by death. Rewards were offered by the Nazis for information on Jews. And neighbors often denounce neighbors for harboring Jews. Thousands of Jews were deported daily to ghettos and extermination camps. - When the announcement came for the deportation (mumbling) of the ghetto, for the resettlement in the east, the Germans were deporting between six and 7,000 Jews daily. That was the quota. Before the deportations, the ghetto had almost half a million Jews. But six weeks later, which was middle of September 1942, there were only 50,000 left. First, they were taking our children, anybody not essential. Children, older people ,sick people, crippled people. But at the end, it made no difference. Because they had to have the numbers. When people were told where the deportations are going to and what's there, when they were told by witnesses, they didn't want to believe. They were told the transports are going to a place called Treblinka. Nobody knew where it was because it was nothing there. It was very isolated area. Where they had built a camp. They had the gas chambers and crematoria. And as soon as transport came in, people were told to get undressed, that they had their hair shaved off. Then they were told they were going for disinfection to have a shower, to leave their bundle of clothes in one place so they will find it. They never came out again. And when people still in the ghetto were told this, they said no, we don't believe it. It was inconceivable to human mind that such a thing was possible in 20th century and that being carried out by so called most cultured nation in Europe. And you could see on the streets people sitting in the same places begging. Specially children. And they always used to sit in one place. So whenever you went by each day you could see those children or people were getting thinner, thinner, and thinner. And one day walking by in the same place you could see a corpse was lying on the street which used to be covered with papers. And it was a terrible sight but one got used to it. You see one needs to walk like a horse with blinkers on, you didn't look to the side, you just walked straight ahead because you knew it was there and nothing that you can do about it. One particular occasion I remember, we're standing outside. It was young German SS officer selecting people. And with a smile on his face, he said those words. "Ladies and gentlemen, (speaking in foreign language)" He said it in German. "Please, hurry up because the coffee is ready "and it'll get cold." It was Herr Hapstung Fillebrant who was in charge of the deportations. And he knew what he meant by the coffee is hot and it will get cold. He had in mind the gas chambers of Treblinka. And that particular day my family was taken away. After my family was taken away, I decided to escape from the ghetto. But I was lucky. I had the contact where I could ask for help which was my mother's friend Maria Twardowska. I did so, I got in touch with her by the phone and I explained to her that the family was taken away. And I would like to get out of the ghetto. And would they help me. It was only her and her husband Adam. And she said, well if I want to come to help. - [Raymond] Some rescuers boldly used their privileged possessions to help save thousands of Jews. Osker Schindler saved hundreds of people. Many priests and nuns and orphanages helped children stay alive and survive. Eugenia Renot, a practicing nun during World War II, was able to hide and rescue 13 Jewish children in a catholic orphanage, many of them left on her doorstep by their desperate parents. Irwin Forrester was one of thousands saved by Raoul Wallenberg, a Swedish observer stationed in Hungary. - I speak quite good German because my parents up to the age of six spoke to me in German language. In Hungary it was a passion at that time. And I knew that if I can catch a German truck that have ordinary soldiers, not SS, you can actually talk to them. I did not, certainly did not admit who I was. I said I was member of the Hungarian Hitler Jugen. But they believed me, they didn't ask for any proof or anything. They believed that I had to get back to Budapest. They just told me to jump up on the truck and they took me back to Budapest. And they were quite talkative during the trip. There were about six or seven soldiers on the truck and we talked to each other and they asked me questions. I had to find out things that I didn't know about, so, but they believed me so. I knew that if I asked for a lift on a Hungarian military truck or any private car, they would have stopped me in every village, the Hungarian Nazis, because it was a rule at the time. So I knew that my only chance to get back to Budapest would be this, the enemy. Then I came back, and I went straight to the Red Cross building. I introduced myself and I said look, if you like, you can stay in the basement. We already have about 25, 30 people there. It won't be 100% safe but this is the best what we can do for you. So that's where I stayed until they arrested us, all of us and took us to the Nazi headquarters, to the Gestapo. Very few people got out alive from that building. I was 20 years old and I was charged with escaping from the army. And that's when I got the idea that one of our mates, there were actually eight of us in the same jail place. And one had a Swedish passport and he said that he's a Swedish citizen. And I said the same thing, I'm a Swedish citizen and my passport was taken away when they arrested me. So in front of me, they rang up the Swedish consulate. They talk to Raoul Wallenberg who didn't know me but he asked who are my particulars, birth date and address and everything else. And he said yes, we have a passport in his name. And I'll be there within two hours with the passport. They let him into the jail and he talked to me and to the other fellow. And we could discuss it in German because he couldn't speak Hungarian, he was Swedish. All he said is that I'm going to try to save you. So that was the last time I saw him. At that time I already had my Swedish passport in my hand and from there they transferred me back to an army barrack with the other guy who had the Swedish passport. And the other six person, they were executed unfortunately. We found out about this after the war. So this is my story with Raoul Wallenberg. He definitely saved my life. If he wouldn't have done it, I wouldn't be alive by now. - [Raymond] Dora Grynberg was saved by Sempo Sugihara, the Japanese Consul General in Kovno. - To survive this second World War as a Jew, you didn't have to be smart, you didn't have to be clever. You just have to be many, many, many times just very lucky. And that's what happened to me and my dear husband. We were just very lucky. We escaped. We had a chance to leave. And so did thousands of others, thanks to the Japanese Consul Kiamo Sempo Sugihara, that is the story of what he has done. Well there is lots of books were written now about him. People were trying to think why did he do it. He actually disobeyed the orders from the government three times. And he knew it's not the right thing to disobey the government. But somehow he had the feeling that he has got to do it, he's got to help the Jews to escape Hitler. Well, there's lots of lots of details about the whole story. Well I'm one of the survivors. If not for him I wouldn't be here, that's for sure. - [Raymond] Most of the child survivors of the holocaust were hidden children. Many parents and guardians made the agonizing decision to leave their children on doorsteps of convents, monasteries or orphanages, and even private doorsteps, hoping they'd be cared for, knowing it was their only chance of survival. On rare occasions, families tried to stay together in hiding, tolerating the most primitive conditions. Families who wished to stay together generally were not able to hide in other homes or churches. It was too risky. Robert and Jacob Grunschlag lost their brother and mother on the day the SS stormed the barn in which they were hiding. Along with their father, the two brothers embarked on a horrific life of hiding in a dirt hole for the majority of the war. - A peasant arrives in our place, introduces himself as Petro Ilnicki. And he says I have been sent here by Kessler and Mrs. Lev to approach you. Eventually they build this bunker underground and they've arranged with Petro Ilnicki that they will give him money and he will provide the food. - The bunker would have been about three meters wide and about two and a half to three quarter meters long on two levels. And both, on each level was about a half a meter 20 high. (man mumbling) The higher level was where they slept. That means eight slept and eight was sitting on the lower level and so on. - Well you know, we are stacked like sardines. And we sleeped in shifts. Eight sleep and eight sit up. And if you want to turn around from left side to the right side, you said, how about everybody turning? And that's how you turned around. But you've got to also understand that it wasn't so easy to hide a Jew because the decree was by the Germans that anybody who is hiding Jews, the whole family will be exterminated. That is a very big thing to ask somebody to hide you. I mean if you're endangering your whole family, you have to be a special guy, special man to do it. Now, Petro was a peculiar guy. He was as, under normal would tell you, he had two brothers, two brothers, right? Or three brothers. - [Jacob] Haila and Nikola, two brothers. - Two brothers. And Kessler was telling us that the whole village feared them. They were the biggest ruffians in the village. - [Jacob] The biggest rogues in the village. - Really, biggest rogues in the village and he was very, very religious. - [Jacob] Very religious guy, very devious, clever. - And they at the types, and believe it or not, they are the types who actually help the Jews. So he build a bunker with the slope of the mountain. As Jac described, on two levels. Between one level and the second level would have been about half a meter, maybe 80 centimeters. The higher level, that's where we slept. The lower level was just like a passage to go. Because the entrance to the bunker was in one end then you had to go to the other end. And in between there was the little stove where we did the cooking. There was the two brother, Friedman was their name? No? - [Jacob] Yeah, yeah, two brothers. - Two brother Friedman. And the younger brother, - [Jacob] Friedlander. - Friedlander, Friedlander, that's right. And the younger brother lay under a bush and decided to go to sleep. My father insisted that we all move around, keep moving and not laying down or sitting so to keep the blood. The circulation and keeping warm. And went up to him and he sent me up to tell him to get up and to, he said leave me be, I just want to sleep. Well this guy must have had a very strong heart because by nine o'clock in the morning, the worms were eating his face that I could see, I couldn't see the body 'cause he had clothing on. But the worms were already coming out of the face. You could see he's still alive. But I think by 11 o'clock he was dead. One day, I approached Jack and I said no, I don't know how you feel. But I have had it. I would like to go down to the Gestapo so they would shoot me. I didn't want to be killed by a net, by Ukrainian but I want to go and give myself up and be shot. And Jac said yeah, I'm with you. So then we approached Pa and told him how we feel. So he begged us, he says look, it's now spring. We already have a bit of food. There'll be more food coming. Things will be much easier. And you know, by then we already also heard rumbles of war. Because the front was something like 80 or 100 kilometers away. And he says I'll promise you one thing. If we are not liberated by autumn, by end of autumn, I will come with you. And he talked us into it. Of course it took two or three convincings, you know this. And we agreed to wait. - [Raymond] Ruth Leiser, her brother and parents also tried to stay together by living from day to day outside in dirt holes. - As fate would have it, a German tank broke down on the highway. They saw a farmhouse, they rolled into the farmhouse. We don't know what they're looking for. Maybe they just wanted to rest or repair the tank or whatever. And they spread out, they took a walk around the farm. And my parents could see their outlines. Why I'm saying my parents? Is because I was nine and you know I was maybe too shellshocked at the time. They saw their outlines through those cracks in the branches that were covering us. And they were just walking around the farm. And one of these busybodies, one of the crew says look at that pile of timber. He says it looks very suspicious. How much do you want to bet that there's partisans or Jews there? So he said to one of the juniors, he said go back to the tank and bring us some hand grenades and we'll find out. And my parents sitting there, hearing what was happening on top, and this was the day of liberation, just about. And so my father didn't lose his head even then. And he forced my mother, he willed her, because she was so distraught by then, she was so weak and so, her whole resistance was completely gone. Where she couldn't practically function normally any more. Not only physically, but emotionally, mentally, they were finished. But my father's will was so strong that he made her, he said to her, crawl out through the barn. 'Cause you know, we had on our stomach to crawl out under the barn wall, crawl out into the barn with the children, go outside, and just march up to the tank crew and speak to them in Polish. My mother spoke perfect Polish. Speak to them in Polish, pretend you are the owner of the farmhouse and you're just hiding with the children from all the shooting that's going on. And my mother, I don't know how she did it but she did it. And she's often remembered that she was so stressed and her mouth was so dry from not having, not only the nerves but she hasn't drunk anything. I mean she said her mouth was so dry that she was afraid to give herself away that her teeth were chattering from terror. So she said she had to hold herself so her teeth wouldn't be chattering from total terror. And my brother and I, he was seven and I was nine by then. How did we look after all this time? I can't imagine how we looked. Like two people. Like somebody dragged out of a pile of mud. My brother and I were two of the only four children that had survived in the vicinity. - [Raymond] Jan Hensel was a 23 year old Christian boy who fell in love with a 16 year old Jewish girl Lucie Pollak. Lucie was in a Polish labor camp, Savin, near the death camp Sobibor. Only days before her escape, Lucie was almost sent for extermination with her mother. - The commandant during one of his pals, stopped by my mother and said you. And he said then to me, do you want to go with your mother Lucie? I had hoped to survive and I just said, no, no, no, no, I don't want to go. So understandably, this was a point of great guilt for me later on after the war. So I took my mother to the gate and she said in German, this is the most difficult journey of my life. And I never saw her again. So obviously she perished. For many, many years I was too afraid to find out what happened. My nightmare was, I know that millions were gassed. But in some strange way if you imagine your mother being gassed, it's the most, well unspeakable. Jan noticed me and approached me. And well, we started to speak and we fell in love. And so from thereon we had a very, very strong relationship. One day I was visiting him during the day. We were actually working in the little village. I don't know, with bricks or something. And we were together in his little house and suddenly there was this bang, bang, bang on the door. And screaming. And well we knew soon who it was. It was the commandant banging and screaming at the door for us to come out and he knew we were there. He pushed me in front of him and had his rifle very close to my back. As the commandant marched be through the streets of Savin, Jan just walked on the side and never for one split second did he waver or try to run away or try to change direction. He just stayed by my side, no matter what and no matter what it cost him even if it cost him his own life. - We arrived in the middle of the camp and the commandant screamed there was the next wagon that was going to the cemetery. He will load me onto that and shoot me at the cemetery. From the start, we knew or we realized that the only way that I could possible survive would be to escape. And he was willing to help me to do that. He managed to obtain false Polish documents. Pretty crude ones at that. And so Jan simply took me to the railway station and we said goodbye. We certainly were sure that we will hoped or thought or whatever that we will see each other after the war and that we will get married and spend our lives together. So anyhow he took me to the railway station where we said goodbye and we never, never saw each other again in our mortal lives. - [Raymond] Daily life experiences of holocaust victims were precarious and intolerable. Death could find them at any moment. - One of the most horrendous memories of mine which surely contributed to my wish to leave ghetto the quickest possible, was when the girl sitting next to me in the taben shop told me something, or rather and started to giggle. We had one of the German guards who was running around with a pistol and occasionally shooting without any good reason. Just as the girl sitting next to me giggled, he thrust into the hall, pointed the pistol at her and shoot her in the head. I fell completely frozen. The blood and the brain of the dying girl splatter all over me and the uniform which I had in hand and repairing. No one notice anything. People were doing they work as nothing happen around them. (somber music) I must say that for many years, this memory stayed with me and it is probably one of the worst thing I ever experienced. As for German cruelty, they seem to like being cruel. During action, I have seen actually Germans taking a baby by their legs and breaking head on the corner of a building with frantic mothers screaming and tearing on and being shot on the spot. I have seen a cruelty which was done as it would be a pleasure for them. I don't believe that one nationality might be more cruel than another. But I think that probably, the bringing up Hitlerjugend where the members of this youth organization were expected to have a pet and take care of it and keep it for sometime and then kill it in the most cruel way. And the members who did not kill their pet or refuse to do it were expelled from Hitlerjugend, they're weaklings. I think that might have contribute to their behavior in occupied territories. - [Raymond] Cesha Glazer was a 19 year old Jewish girl. Her Aryan looks enabled her to acquire documents allowing her to live in a flat outside the Warsaw Ghetto. Along with two ladies posing as her aunties sent by Zegota, a Christian organization helping Jews survive, Cesha was able to hide six people in her flat. None of Cesha's family survived the deportations to the extermination camps. - The hiding place we created was a very clever one. We heard of instances that people had good hiding places but because they called in help, they were after denounced. They were stripped of any valuables they had and finally denounced to the Gestapo. So we decided that our hiding place will be created by ourselves. In a briefcase, I was carrying up bricks which were needed to break up. There was an opening from the kitchen to a windowless alcove. We bricked up from the top and left only an opening at the bottom large enough that a person can slide in. At this time, to be able to protect the people in hiding at my place, I had to make sure that I won't be taken to Germany for slave labor which wasn't very often procured. So I had to work for the German war effort and have a certificate stating this. I found a job at a large laundry taken over by the Germans. Suddenly at our laundry, we saw men in the normal concentration camp gear. They were wearing these striped uniforms. One of them was an extremely handsome and interesting man who lost already his wife and two children in Auschwitz. I became friendly with him as much as it was possible in those conditions. And at a certain stage, I offered that I will help him escape. I had everything organized. He was going to be picked up when he walked out somehow from the laundry. What happened, somehow, the SS men, who one of the guards who came with them became somehow suspicious and started to follow him all the time. And he couldn't shake him off. He somehow was able to get behind him and picked up a line of timber and hit the SS man on the head. Some pilots who were just there from the Luftwaffe who came to pick up their laundry rushed over, saw what happened and shot Paul. At this day, when more and more voices are heard that the holocaust never happened, it is important to leave documents which will educate the new generations what really happened and hopefully, it should never happen to anybody again. - On 6 August 1942, Janus Kojak stepped into legend. With quiet dignity, he led a little army of 192 children in his care from the Warsaw Ghetto orphanage onto Treblinka. He chose to reassure his children by staying with them to perish with his beloved children, not wishing them to go through their ordeal alone. Many rescuers did not survive World War II. This Polish book, titled Those Who Helped, is a tribute to the thousands of people that helped Jewish Holocaust victims. The records kept by the Nazis published in this book note thousands of Polish families denounced by neighbors and then executed along with the Jews they were helping. This book is a testament to all those who perished honoring humanity. The people who risked their lives to save others featured in this documentary are among the 16,000 people worldwide honored by the Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial in Jerusalem as righteous among nations, with the courage to care. Generations of families start with one person. These are the survivors, their children, grandchildren, and great grandchildren. They are here today because ordinary people had the courage to care. I believe in the sun even when it is not shining. I believe in love even when I do not experience it. I believe in God even when he is silent. (somber music) This film commemorates and celebrates the care that led to courage, the courage that led to care. (somber music)
