Baby, you and I could write a book about love Oh, here we are One to one Looking back to see how far we've come We've shared it all You and I Still together after all this time We had to break it all down to build it back up Lean on each other when the times got rough How'd we survive going through so much? Baby, you and I could write a book about love Here we are Once again We're stronger now than we have ever been We're hand in hand We're heart to heart Ah, here we are Here we are Here we are We could walk away now Call it over and done Say we fought the good fight And nobody won Say we're both better off That worse came to worse So we didn't last Hey, we're not the first Then again, if we give it one more try We might find the feeling Never really died There's still a chance to be All we might have been And find the love we had back then again Off to such a good start But somehow it seems We've let our hearts Fall apart at the dreams We could throw in the towel Walk away with our pride Say it just wasn't worth All the tears that we've cried Then again, if we give it one more try We might find the feeling Never really died And there's still a chance to be All we might have been Let's find the love we had back then again Maybe if we want it bad enough Enough, enough, enough We can make it better than it ever was There's still a chance to be All we might have been And find the love we had back then again Clear creeks Cool mountain mornings Honest work out in the fields Corn bread In my mama's kitchen Daddy saying grace before the meals Now, family ties run deep in this land And I'm never very far from what I am I was born country, and that's what I'll always be Like the rivers and the woodlands, wild and free I got a hundred years of down home Running through my blood I was born country, and this country's what I love Moonlight And you here beside me Crickets serenading in the yard What more Could two people ask for? Layin' here in love beneath the stars This is where I want to raise my kids Just the way my mom and daddy did I was born country, and that's what I'll always be Like the rivers and the woodlands, wild and free I got a hundred years of down home Running through my blood I was born country, and this country's what I love I was born country, and that's what I'll always be Like the rivers and the woodlands, wild and free I got a hundred years of down home Running through my blood I was born country And this country's what I love I'm in a hurry to get things done Oh, I rush and rush until life's no fun All I really got to do is live and die But I'm in a hurry and don't know why Don't know why I have to drive so fast My car has nothing to prove, it's not new But it'll do zero to sixty in five-point-two, oh I'm in a hurry to get things done Oh, I rush and rush until life's no fun All I really got to do is live and die But I'm in a hurry and don't know why Can't be late I leave in plenty of time, shaking hands with the clock I can't stop I'm on a roll, and I'm ready to rock, oh I'm in a hurry to get things done Oh, I rush and rush until life's no fun All I really got to do is live and die But I'm in a hurry and don't know why I hear a voice That says I'm running behind, I better pick up my pace it's a race And there ain't no room for someone in second place I'm in a hurry to get things done Oh, I rush and rush until life's no fun All I really got to do is live and die But I'm in a hurry and don't know why Once upon a lifetime I looked in someone's eyes And felt the fire burning in my heart for the very first time She was scared and young Yes, she was And had never tasted love So I took her by the hand, and a boy became a man Once upon a lifetime Once upon a lifetime You hold the queen of hearts But if you gamble on a diamond when the dealing starts You stand to lose it all, yes, you do As the cards began to fall And the lesson learned is hard You're only dealt the queen of hearts Once upon a lifetime So if you're takin' chances, know the chance you take A broken heart's a high price to pay Foolish ways will make fools of the wise And the best things seldom come along twice Once upon a lifetime You know that you've been blessed When you hold your firstborn tenderly against your chest Through the innocence you'll see Yes, you will The value of a family And you feel that special bond That only comes along Once upon a lifetime So if you're takin' chances, know the chance you take A broken heart's a high price to pay Now, foolish ways will make fools of the wise And the best things seldom come along twice And people only find A love like yours and mine Once upon a lifetime Hey, baby, won't you take my hand Make me a happy man I ain't rich, but I found my fortune in you Two jobs on the nighttime shift Still left with an empty fist But my heart is full, and my love is true We can still get married In the style of our friends and family Gather all of 'em to celebrate while we slip out quietly And have a hometown honeymoon Wildflowers and love is in bloom We'll have a hometown honeymoon Just me and you, girl Hometown honeymoon Out the church and up to your room We'll have a hoedown afternoon Dancin' to the rhythm of love We can sing and laugh out loud Lifestyles of the poor but proud Cuddle up on the porch and enjoy the view We can't afford Niagara Falls But there's a fountain by the old town hall We'll make a wish by the light of a lover's moon I'll get my grandma's wedding ring And my brother's Chevrolet We can stay at your mama's house We don't have to go away To have a hometown honeymoon Wildflowers and love is in bloom We'll have a hometown honeymoon, just me and you Well, now, hometown honeymoon Out of church and up to your room We'll have a hoedown afternoon, dancin' to the rhythm of love Your daddy's prized possession I'll make a good impression I'm gonna get his blessin' That's all we need Hometown honeymoon, wildflowers and love is in bloom We'll have a hometown honeymoon, just me and you, girl Hometown honeymoon Out of church and up to your room We'll have a hoedown afternoon, dancin' to the rhythm of love One more Dancin' to the rhythm of love Let's roll the windows down, turn the radio up Let the wind blow through our hair Love is reckless Let's get reckless tonight There ain't nothin' out here but the big ol' Texas sky And there's a red sun painted across the coming night Well, your daddy's got plans for you And mine thinks I'm at school And they say it's reckless to chase a dream But this town's got nothin' for you and me Let's roll the windows down, turn the radio up And let the wind blow through our hair There's a moon tonight and a road outside Daddy, we're gettin' out of here I could ca re less Where this leads us If love gets reckless Let's get reckless tonight Well, let's take my Thunderbird and leave tonight I'll put the pedal to the floor till we see the mornin' light They can't live our lives for us If we let 'em, we'll lose our love And love dies hard in this Texas sun I'd rather be reckless and on the run Let's roll the windows down, turn the radio up And let the wind blow through our hair There's a moon tonight and a road outside Baby, we're gettin' out of here Let's roll the windows down Let's turn the radio up Let's turn it up Life ain't all that easy 'Cause I can testify to that Yeah, it's been up and down and round and round To get to where I'm at If you could see how I'm livin' And this old car I drive Well, you'd probably ponder and even wonder Why I'd even want to stay alive But give me one more shot I'll give it all I got Let me open my eyes to a new sunrise, I pray Give me one more chance I'll learn to dance the dance I'm satisfied just bein' alive Give me one more day I could complain about taxes Or the weather we're havin' today And go on and on about things that are wrong From New York to L.A. But that's just not my nature Oh, to sit around feelin' sad We're only here for a while, so why not smile Hey, livin' ain't all that bad Give me one more shot I'll give it all I got Let me open my eyes to a new sunrise, I pray And give me one more chance I'll learn to dance the dance I'm satisfied just bein' alive Give me one more day Yeah, I'm satisfied just bein' alive Give me one more day Give me one more shot I'll give it all I've got Give me one more day And show me the way Give me one more day Give me one more shot She don't love carelessly Now, that's what I've always heard Can't use the usual lines She measures every word No empty promises Proof is what it takes to win her heart The truth and nothin' less Simple things that set her far apart Save your diamonds and your pearls She's not your ordinary girl She ain't your ordinary She ain't your ordinary girl She ain't your ordinary She ain't your ordinary girl No midnight alibis No foolish games for her And if you cross that line You'll get what you deserve But when you see her smile Nothin' seems to matter anymore And in a little while You'll feel like you've never felt before Like no other in the world She's not your ordinary girl She ain't your ordinary She ain't your ordinary girl She ain't your ordinary She ain't your ordinary girl She ain't your ordinary She ain't your ordinary girl I've got her photograph On a stand by my bed Two on the mantle And thousands in my head I can't believe how fast she's growing It ain't supposed to be like this Every time I look at her I see how much I miss I missed her first steps Her first words And “I love you, Daddy“ is something I seldom heard Oh, it hurts me so To watch my girl grow up in pictures I send the money down I do my best to do my part But it can't compare To what I pay with my heart There's still one unanswered question That weighs heavy on my mind Will she ever understand the reasons why? I missed her first steps Her first words And "I love you, Daddy" is something I seldom heard Oh, it hurts me so To watch my girl grow up in pictures it takes all I have To keep the tears inside And what I wouldn't give If I could turn back time I missed her first steps Her first words And "I love you, Daddy" is something I seldom heard Oh, it hurts me so To watch my baby grow up in pictures I thought that you could fly Thought that you had wings I guess that I believed You'd never say good-bye But my world stopped turnin' round The stars turned upside down it knocked me to the ground On my knees Now there's a sad lookin' moon Shinin' down on me There's a sad lookin' sky As far as I can see I always believed And I thought the stars could see But there's a sad lookin' moon Shinin' down on me I shared with you my dreams Gave you everything I opened up my heart And I gave you my ring I spent days and nights Singin' about the time When you would be mine all my life Now there's a sad lookin' moon Shinin' down on me There's a sad lookin' sky As far as I can see I always believed And I thought the stars could see But there's a sad lookin' moon Shinin' down on me There's a sad lookin' moon A sad lookin' moon There's a sad lookin' moon Shinin' down on me Drinkin' was forbidden In my Christian country home I learned to play the flattop On them good old gospel songs Then I heard about the barrooms Just across the Georgia line Where a boy could make a livin' Playin' the guitar late at nights I had to learn about the ladies 'Cause I was too young to understand Why the young girls fall in love With the boys in the band When the boys turn to music The girls just turn away To some other guitar picker In some other late-night place Yeah, I held onto my music I let the ladies walk away Took my songs and dreams to Nashville Then I moved on to L.A. And up to New York City All across the U.S.A. Well, I've lost so much of me But there's enough of me to say That my home's in Alabama No matter where I lay my head My home's in Alabama Southern born and Southern bred And what keeps me goin'? I don't really know Can't be the money Lord knows I'm always broke Could it be the satisfaction Of bein' understood When the people really love you And let you know when it's good Well, I'll speak my Southern English Just as natural as I please 'Cause I'm in the heart of Dixie Dixie's in the heart of me And someday when I make it When love finds a way Somewhere high on Lookout Mountain I'll just smile with pride and say That my home's in Alabama No matter where I lay my head My home's in Alabama Southern born and Southern bred Southern born and Southern bred Southern born and Southern bred And my home's in Alabama...
