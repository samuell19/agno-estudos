TSUBURO NO GARA Anybody there...? Help me! Is there someone outside? Where did the doctor get to? I can't open the door. Can you walk? I hear a siren in the distance. I hear nothing. Are you injured? What are you doing? I'm trying to get the door open. It's a waste of time... The door's locked. None of the rooms have locks. Hurry up. Let's get out of here. What's all this? What kind of medicine is that? Where did you get it? Something is burning... that's why I'm so hot. Hey... did you hear that? Help! Somebody help! We're in here! Help! It's only an echo. No, somebody's out there. Even if there is, he'll be locked up like us. How can you sleep? But I'll be here. What do you mean? I've been here a long time. The whole place will be destroyed. Give it back. Give me back my medicine. I don't know anything. I just don't know. My medicine... I'm sorry. Get out of here, quickly! Have you ever tried to escape before? Don't you have any friends? I don't need the outside world. I've suffered no inconvenience... from being here. Have you ever experienced freedom? About this place being locked up... that's a lie, isn't it? Are you scared? No one's here. They're all gone. Hello...? Yes... yes... Sure... Who were you talking to? It's alright now... the doctor will come to save us. You'd better get some rest. Yes, I should. What kind of dreams do you have? I never dream. You can use my bed. You can watch my TV. I have many books. Doctor... when will you take my plaster-cast off? I'm afraid I can't do that. Give it back to me. Give it back. Give it back. What do you want? Give me back my medicine. I don't have it. I'm sure the doctors will cure you. I don't need the nuts and bolts any more. Everybody's dead by now. Only you and I are alive. It's impossible to live in such a tiny space... For both of us. I've been protected. You've been dead. You're dead. Will you hit me again? Stop it... Don't. You... must... get away. Why did you come back? It was a dead end. You're much better off outside than in here. I hate being alone. Are you in pain? Somebody will soon come and find us. Hey... where are you going? What can you see? Listen... Listen, are you scared?
