Okay, up next, we have Maxwell Park! Come on up, man. MAX: No, you didn't. - No. - Look, you said you're too tired to drive, and-and the highway patrol took away my permit, so I'm not driving anywhere tonight or in the next six months, so come on. Why'd you think I wanted to come here? I thought it was the cheese fries. Don't be a weenie. (laughs): "Don't be a weenie"? Did you not hear their Bon Jovi? This is not Broadway.
