This is Team four. Team four! Team four, this is control. Report. What the hell do you think you doing down there?! My goddamn men are dying! Your people mutating and tearing my men in shreds. Sir, the whole facility is in red alert. I'm showing contamination from level three to twelve, Sir. Anybody hear me?! I've counted five different mutations so far. And there are hundreds of the buggers down here! What have you unleashed here?! We need help now, god damn it! We lost visual, sir. Sir, what are your orders? Sir, what are your orders?! Seal level 10. Human presence detected in the observation chamber. Fourteen A, level ten. What about that now? Purge that. Just close your eyes. It just cut us in half... Help me! Extraction... -Help me! -Go to hell! Security Breach on levels 13, 12 and eight. Hello? Is anyone there? Security required. Failure in open retentors 57-61. Biological container filters failure. ...non-human presence detected on levels 6 to 13. All emergency exits sealed. Wait for quarantine procedures. Anyone? Is anyone there? All emergency exits sealed. Wait for quarantine procedures. Run they are coming! We must get away from here! Check in ventilation ducts! For the hell of it. Stay right there! Michaels, in ventilation behind you! Give us a chance, dammit! Just give us time to recharge. Rico! Control, setting up withdraw! Kirkland, Kirkland, lets go! We just lost our evac! Lets go, Philip! Come on! Stop! -Get out of me! -Stop! -Just put a bullet in the brain. -Shut up Kirkland! Pull up your hair. Show me your neck. This is a bad idea. She can turn in one of those things, just like everyone else! Shut up, or the next goes in you! OK. She is clean. -No, she is not, man. -She is clean, dammit! What the hell is happening?! -We need to get out of here. -Where, Dare? You come with us, or take your chances down there. Your choice. Right everybody. In the need you to move quickly and quietly. Michaels, you take point! You are right in front of me. Kirkland, Michaels, Green is on. -Hey, move on! -Shhhh, quiet. Is quiet right, for now. -Or maybe not. -Is everybody all right? What are those things out there? Honey, They're the last thing you see before you die. Those things are only the start of your problems, jumbo. Shut up. You can't see you're scaring her! -I just want to know what is going on. -Yes, and I want some answers too. -We are just the hired help. -But, you're soldiers. -You must know what is going on. -Mercs sweet heart. We get paid for living. In our profession it pays to not ask too many questions. If the money is there, hum? Figures. Let's just say, this facility is not the safest place to be. What I can tell you is what I know. Please?! A week ago my security clearance was level two. And that is...? crossing bacterial, vaccines, enzyme test... Nothing too major. Bullshit. See you people coming through dozen going on your local hospital. Slow down, friend. Since I've been upgraded, I've seen strange things. Things I can't explain. Nothing to clearance for answers. Whatever they are doing down here. Was missing but something more, unlike nature. -It was something-- -Something what? Something else. What the hell was that?! Whatever it is, we gonna have to find another way out of here. Agreed. We cannot stay here. We must to get to the surface. What are you talking about? It is almost impossible to get to the surface. I say we sit here and wait until help arrives! It's gonna be a safe place to hold up. We can't just sit here and wait. Eventually those things will just work out where we are. And than we are fucking lab rats. Isn't there another way, like isn't there another lab we can-- -How far down are we?! -No, we need to get to the surface! That's stupid!! Than I suppose you have a better suggestion. How about anything that not involve suicide? -How many levels? -Everybody shut up! -Where are we heading? -Level nine. How come? We just need to get out of here. This facility went to lock down in the moment this shit started happening. I lost 13 trained man in the way down here. Do you think that two techs and two lab rats will gonna do any better? Our best bet is getting to the control bunker on level nine, then maybe we're get this facility out of the lock down. -How do we get there? -We get back up in the vents. We find a vertical shaft. We'll see how it looks from there. That's it.. -Hey "sergeant Rock", move on! -Shut up and listen! What is that? -Stay here. -Don't leave us! He left us. Are you alright?! -Doc! -Help me with her, dammit! Hold on on her. -Give me something to put in her mouth. -What? Anything otherwise or she's going to swallows her tongue! Here! Somebody shut her up, before she lets every one of those things know where we are! You should not do that! -It's alright. You're safe now. -What happened? -You had some kind of seizure. -What? -Can you move? -I think so. I had this dream... There're all this creatures... Everything was turning black. It was... coming from my inside. There is so much wrong with you. You crazy bitch. Hold fire, friendly. -What happened? -Changing plans. We need to find some weapons soon. Or we all will be dead in a couple of hours. We are changing plans again? There's a weapon locker. -One level down. -Down? But five minutes ago you said up was safer. Do you even know what the hell you are doing? -Well, I'm staying right here! -Me too. I do not following captain Kangaroo anymore. Fine. Stay here if you like. Die by yourself. Lose the light, through. Can't be sure, but it seems to attract them. There are signs to be people alive in the complex. You keep it down to yourself, sister. Everybody stay here. Stay calm, be quiet. Michaels, hold position with the civilians. Hey, take all the time you need. There are only face-eating monsters trying to kill us. Door is locked. -Gimme five minutes to override it. -Get into it. I need two volunteers... I need hands to get supplies from the weapons locker. -I'll go. -Good. Ah, No! What a surprise! Will you excuse me for not willing to craw around in the dark with all those things running-- -No! I need a second one. Good. The rest of you: no wander off. Stay close to me. -You said five minutes. -Is just on time. Stop doing that! It is just the tension. Ease your tension some other way. Is all right to be scare, you now. I'm not scared. Quiet! Last thing I need is one of them to take a boar head of my ass because can't keep your mouth shut. That smell eats at all day. -How is going there? -Almost done. -Where are the other two? -They were behind us. Shit! Let it be! Oh God, here they come!!! Got to put all the shit back in the vent. Get in. Move! That's all we gonna hear all day. Run! Jesus Christ! Where are you going? They can be in trouble. -There is nothing you can do! -Let me go! Move! Move! Michaels, cover us next. Keep your eye. Stay here and cover our six. Power is out. Get on Michaels. Stay in contact. We sign you in when we get there. What is wrong? You're really ready to die for the people? What? Maybe Kirkland was right. What if we ditched them right now? Are you kidding? Without this people we would be dead already. I'm not in the Babysitting, mate. It's not paying well. If they do come, aim for the major body organs. These things maybe not humans anymore. If you put enough lead, they go down. Here's the trick. We ain't going anywhere until I flip that switch. It's probably in one of access tunnels. You keep this people quiet. If I'm not back in five minutes, start taking them back into the vents. Michael, we are moving down to the next access panel to try to remove the power from the door. Hold position. Roger that. -Six come in. -Six in position. All clear. I'm moving on. No movement, nothing yet. Nothing. Michaels. I reached the vertical access. Going to upper level. Stand by. Fire at the storage sites. Safety supports report to southern bounds... Attention generator crew three, your change is three hours overdue. Please report to shift supervisor for assignment. -Roger that. -What is going on? -He is fixing the door. -How much longer?! If he is not back in four minutes, we're going back to the vents. We have power. ...there is something coming. Michaels? -Kirkland, is Michael with you? -That is a negative. Shit! -They've found us. -Everyone, inside! Fuck! Back up, now! Quickly, help me bring her inside! -I can't bring them in here. -Watch us! -I said you can't come in here. - shut up! She's not breathing! Can you help me getting to the medical though that door? Get in there. Kirkland, can you grab her? Hold on! Michaels, Michaels. Can you read me? Hey, hey! -I strongly suggest against that. -Oh, shut up! -Is anything I can do here? -Give me the booster. Do you read me? What is the situation? Michaels, tell me. What is the situation? Clear! Clear! Michaels! Come back! I can't raise it here. I'm coming back. Where you think you're going with that weapon? Get the fuck of me! He is right! What do you going to do outside? Just get yourself killed? Fuck! Dare? Answer me, goddammit! Are you alright? What do we do? We need to seal this place shut. And find any barricade. Or it up. It was impregnable 20 minutes ago. Before you turn on the power back on. You, shut up! We're going to need the weapons left behind. It's not exactly safe out there. I'm not match for anyone here. So I go. We need you here. -They're trying to get in already. -Shut up! No, they may not know we are here. What is that?! Don't open it! Oh, catch you out, big baby. Who is that? Name is Konieg. He is one of the heads of department. Always being too high up to talk to be worker bees. I can't get in the security module disable. No power in most systems. What do we do? I'm no leader. You got this people looking to secure the place. You got it covered. I could use a some help. If Dare were here, he would establish comms as soon as possible. I've done this by checking the comm station. It's half working. Receiving only. The problem isn't in the system. It's on our send and receive capabilities. The antenna arrays on the surface. The problem will be there. So one of us must get up there and fix it. But, hey, wait. Is pretty messed up there.. And who is gonna do it, love? You? No, I suppose not. I gonna need someone to watch my back. I'll go. No, we need at least one of you to stay here. Hey, dickhead, don't push you luck with me. He's right. We need one of you here. I'll take that one. What? -I want to thank you. -For what? You risked life to bring us those weapons. Let's get one thing straight: I didn't do any of this to help you people. I'm of to get me of here alive. That's my only priority. Not you and your friends, sweetheart. Then, why come back at all? If you're so interested in your own safety, why came back and help us at all? OK, you're good. Do I get a gun? -You fired one before? -No, never. It's on safety. But with this switch, you get unlock. Point and squeeze. Don't yank it Remember to breathe. -You. -What? While I'm gone, anyone but you is in charge, Got it? Are you sure about this? Seal the door behind me. Well, better hold them. Ex mortis. Souls. Oh shit! We don't have time for this. Give me a break, man. I'm not some killing machine. -I'm just some guy. -Don't look down! -I've already looked down! -Just step out! Why in the hell are we doing this by ourselves? If we can get out, shouldn't all go? Six of us out in harbor, one is thinking is a human vibrator. Whenever she feels like it. Great fucking idea, moron! Shut up and climb! Open yourself for me. Nightmare? Here. It doesn't taste so good. You are right, that's disgusting. That's the least of our problems, isn't it? Did you put me in here? I had to have a soldier helping me. I though you could be stressed. What's going to happen to us? I wish I knew. Konieg is higher up in the food chain than me. I think he may know what the procedure is, or something like this. They have a procedures for something like this? Unfortunately, yes. I just thought no idea what it is. And getting any information off Konieg is almost impossible. He is an asshole. Yes, he is, isn't he? Alright now. You get some rest. On or off? On, please. OK. Get some rest, OK? Konieg! You scared me. You know what she is, right? Two words: lab rat. Maybe. But she is still a human being. Unlike some of us. Get out of my way, Konieg. How are you feeling, Miss Yutani? I've felt better. Now, get out of my way We got a problem here? No. No problem. -What was that? -I don't know. You can see anything? It sounds big. I know. Shit!. Beack up slowly, towards your right. Is that thing that you think I can do any good? Get your six too! What? -I gonna triple the gain. Get the weapon I gave to you. -Why? Because I'll run towards the antennas. I need you to cover my back. Right? What am I suppose to do? Keep him out slowly towards the right. When I get there, cover I you. When I sign you, you run as fast as you can. OK. Now! I hit it. It went down. Hey, Could you see it? Could you see it? No, I lost it as soon as it hit the ground. We're getting the hell of here, right? We're getting the hell of here, right? Hey, listen to me! Not until I see it's dead as it did. Get back, get back. Get back, get back. -Get back! -What, what? Get back, get back! THE SERVER IS DOWN RESTART Hey, they are rebooting the system. Is that something I can do for you? You know, I'm not blind. And I'm not stupid. What is it? What are you talking about? Look what is going on around you. What if this is just the start to something beyond anybody's comprehension? Yours, maybe. But I know exactly what I’m doing. You're not in control anymore. It is not a virus, is it? It is the end of the world. You should really check your pay stubs. Besides, I've got what I need. She is sleeping in that room back there. That's right! There's something swimming inside of you right now. It's funny how a little perspective can change things, isn't it? I won't let you do this, Konieg. Then you just have-- That's not your friend, there is it? What the hell is that? I thing it's trying to open the door. Oh hell... -Get away of the door, you idiot! -Fuck me! -No, the controls... -Find me the oxygen! Come on! Hurry up! Do you think it's gone? Give something to shield or something. This door won't last forever! Go! Jesus! Give me the rivet tool! Give me that! -It's trying to get in the back. -We miss something. Jesus! I almost shut you. What is going on? I thought I heard something in the hall. You sure did. It's in the room, by the end of the hall. Everybody, stay behind me. It is me, your asshole! Where is Canning? He didn't make. RESTART IMPLEMENTED It's been on that screen since up and running. I can't get it running either. So our trip to the surface was a waste of time. Fuck! This all is a big waste of time, man. What the... Where is Konieg? Get up! -Who're you talking to? -Help. My help. Hell no. They're coming here to kill everything, aren't they? Possible. We'll be alright, won’t we? They are coming to help us, right? No, the only one who can get out here alive is him. Maybe we can get online. Let them know there is more than us down here. They already know what is down here. He already told them that. You'll kill all of us. Why? You really have no idea what we dealing with, do you? Your little experiment get away, doc. That's all. -Really? -We obviously die. You can tell us. Yeah, doc. Let's have it! Let me start by saying: you are all like your leak. It began in north Africa during the second world war. The Germans were scouring the globe looking for religious artifacts to aid in their world conquest. It was Hitler's Afrika Korps, that discovered it. An ancient relic, or sorts. A fossil, to be more precise. An angel. Bull shit! Yes, an angel. Michaels, I will end this motherfucker right now! -Back off! -An angel. But not just any ordinary angel. They found the first angel. Who? Lucifer. The black angel. They found the exact spot where it fell to earth, after it was cast from heaven. The Russians tumbled the cross when Berlin fell. When transporting back to Russia, three battalions were lost, during mad battle. They slaughtered each other. The same thing happened to the Americans troops that took control of it. So they did the only thing they could do: They locked it away for a very long time. -How the hell did you get the hands-on it? -Money. Money can buy you anything. What have you been doing with it? Take a look at yourself. The idiot killed off the other one. So now you are my pride and joy. Oh, come now. Is not that much of the stretch of the imagination, is it? No, no. I have a life. You erased my memory. We almost caught you perfect. But it keeps trying to get out. Don't worry, we get you right next time. What about those things out there? And that thing in the door? Minions. We're structuring their hosts in various ways to take form in this world. You can't exactly predict what's going to happen, when dealing with the supernatural. It's this one you have to worry about. Evil flows to her veins. She'll turn to you when you least expect it. That's not true! It's not true! You would die using these things as weapons. Some believe in a higher power. Mine just happen to be different from yours. I think we have get enough listening to this. What's the code to activate the systems. Kirkland, is all yours. 3826-46. I'm not lying. I am telling you the truth. Burgen asshole! Tie him up! You knew about this. I knew was a little clone. That's all. I'm sorry. I didn't know. I didn't know it. What the hell are all of them? I thought that would be stalking by the door by now. I found something you not going to like. -Explain this! -It's a clock. It's a digital clock. God dammit. I'll tell you. Just stop hitting me. It is a countdown clock. OK, OK. It is a countdown for a tactical strike. What kind? Orbital Nuclear. Rule number one: If you can't control it, it doesn't exist. You asshole! You said help earlier. How many? How many?! I don't know. -Small squad. -The one that move fast and quietly. He already gave them our position. You're OK? Do we still have a chance? I don't know. But don't have to activate the elevator shaft to get down to the surface. We used that to come up. What about bombs? They don't have the transport. We have to get to the surface and take from them. What now? All we can do is wait. Yutani? Yutani, are you OK? I'm coming in there! Yutani? I'll get help. No, no. Then, open the door. No! You are sick. You need help. I'll get somebody. No, nobody can help. - Konieg? - He only helps himself. You can't just sit in there. Yes, I can. It is better for everyone. Yutani, open this door! Stay close to the soldiers. They'll protect you. Whatever you do, keep away from Konieg. What are you talking about? Kirkland, cut the lights! Lena, what happened?! What the hell is going on? -Where is Yutani? -She got locked. Shoot the fucking thing out! Madre de Dios! Did she say anything to you? Anything at all? - She is in shock, sergeant. - Lena, what happened? Let her rest, man. Doctor... She's been infected. -What did you do?! -It wasn't me. It was me. The CPR... We have have to cleanup the body. What the hell did you done?! Sorry to say, but... this one, I can't take the blame for. This is something new. Something unexpected. Can we move her? Normally I would say no, but... we're not in normal right now. We gonna need some more protection. There is plastic drop sheets in the store room. Idiot! So you can track the variant, did you Yutani? I just have to take a sample of that. Stupid woman. I told you not touch her. Start talking! You wouldn't understand! Explain it to me, like I was fool. It is an important work. I will not apologize for my actions. What the hell is going on? The asshole has been carrying a grab pack full of secrets electing not to tell us about it. -What? -Man... I've been looking for an excuse all night... Shut up, moron! You don't have the IQ to throw consecutive punches. -I gonna throw you face down in the lawn! -Back off. What is this?! It has nothing to do with you. Try harder, sir. It is her, in a bottle. What am I, doctor? The Future. You bastard! No! What is this? Open it, and find out. You hold in your hands the book of souls. The manual script that foretells the period when hell will reign on earth. Evil will come to you in many forms and take the face of an angel. Prime that bring you death. You're not in there. How do you know? I can feel something inside me trying to get out. What if what he says is true. We get you out of here and it might help you. If he did this, he can undo it. Why you're so sure that's a good idea? Besides, what you care? You're on it for of yourself, right. People change. Yeah... they do. Two minutes! We're coming through. Going units six and two. Team one to secure the main bay. Team is leads. We're running down to the jet car aboard the the turbo shaft. Copy that. Turbo shaft here. On the way. No contact so far. We are in. Getting down. We are moving out. When I take the gag of, I don't want any more shit of you. Got it? What is the problem? Come on, people. Do you want to get out of here, or not? We have a slight problem here. -What? -My legs. I can't feel them. When did this happen? I don't know. Believe me... I would've said something sooner. Oh, man! It hurts. Jesus! Doc, Get them the hell of me! Cut his hands loose. Get your ass over here! -What the hell are you doing? -Shut up and give me my bag! C'mon on, hurry up, hurry up! C'mon on, hurry up, give to me!
