I'm moping in this nice weather like an idiot. It's like I'm drowning in that great blue sky. Akane. You're going to be late. Akane. My stomach hurts. I'm not going to school today. You don't have a fever. Perhaps you've got a cold? Shall I call the doctor? No, I'll just stay in bed. Okay then, sleep well. MAYUKO'S MESSAGES What? My hair clip? Didn't you read Riya-chan's messages last night? We all agreed to wear the hair clips today at school. My mom even handmade them for us. Why didn't you put it on? You didn't like it? Yesterday I was with my grandmother. I forgot my cellphone at home. Good morning, Akane! Good morning. You put it on as we agreed, The hair clip. Matching hair clips makes us feel like real friends. Yes, real friends! That's right! This text is from Kama-Niko... I didn't know about it. Believe me. So Akane, can you tell Riya-chan and the others? Please? Are you coming to my house? Sure! BIRTHDAY WONDERLAND Yuck! Why are you sticking your butt on my face again?! Gorobeh, you idiot! I'm hungry. You see... Wait on the terrace. I'll make something now. I feel so guilty. Cats have it easy, it must be nice. Here. Thanks for the food. Being a full-time housewife must be nice too. Anyway, Mom's cooking is delicious. How are you feeling? Well... my headache went away. Wasn't your stomach hurting? I also had a headache. Could you run a little errand for me? What is it? I want you to go see Chii-chan. What? Why? Why do I have to go see Chii-chan? Why? Why... Tomorrow is your birthday, right? I asked Chii-chan for a gift. So go get it for me. I'm going to get my own birthday present? That's so strange. No way! A greeting gift. Take care! I'm not sure any more. I like this one better. But this one definitely suits you better! Here, take it. An old man from a small town in Bolivia made it with beautiful local stones. I loved it at first sight But he wouldn't sell it to me, he said it wasn't complete yet. But when I told him it was already beautiful He asked to trade it for a bar of chocolate. Then when I got back here I added a light bulb to it. I really like it. But if you'll take care of it, I can sell it to you. The witch is trying to sell something. - How much is it? - Let's see... - 1,000 yen. - So cheap! That's awful! She traded it for a bar of chocolate. So try it out. If you like it, pay me for it later. Why do you think it suits me? It's incomplete. Akane! What a surprise! How are you doing? Long time no see! We met last month. You brought us Thai cakes that stank of durian. Is that right? You still have a child's figure. What's wrong? It's all right. After another year you'll start to grow. Ah! Is this from Midori? Thank you. So, what brings you here? Your birthday gift? Your mom asked me for something? Are you going to travel again? To southern France, the Isle-sur-la-Sorgue market. I've always wanted to go there It's a really beautiful place, isn't it? Do you want a cup of tea? As you wish. Chii-chan doesn't like me, but I love this store. What's this? A piece of the Berlin Wall? Of course not. What?! Chii-chan! What's wrong? My hand's stuck! I can't move it! Did someone knock? I don't know. Come and help me. - Was it from the basement? - You have a basement? I've always had it. I use it for storage. Getting here was complicated. W-Who are you? What are you doing in my basement? Burglar? I'll call the police! Calm down. I am not a dangerous person. You seem a little too old to me. I'm calling the police. I'm looking for the Goddess of the Green Wind. The one whose hand matches that imprint. What's wrong with you? How rude! You're the rude one! I'm not talking to you! Get out! I see... It worked, Pipo! Thank you so much, Hippocrates-sama! Chii-chan, is he supposed to speak? What? I don't know... I've been frozen since this morning so my joints are cracking. And fly? Probably... I apologize for my late introduction: My name is Hippocrates. This is my student, Pipo. Nice to meet you, my name is Pipo. He said nice to meet you? Nice to meet you? That's right. It's my first time seeing him. We came from another world Connected to your world through this basement But I don't think you know what I'm talking about. Truly, although it may hard to believe. Amazing! What? You mean that famous other world? A nearby world, but it's completely different? The one we see in movies and novels? This thing we call the parallel world? Connected to this basement? I've lived here my whole life! This is the first time I've heard about it! Since when? Hey, since when? For many years. All this wasted time! I wish I had known there was this amazing world earlier. Tell me how it looks? What does this other world look like? First come and help me break free of this! Oh, I forgot. Do something, mustache owner. Relax your hand. I apologize for hurrying. But you should accompany us immediately. This is your destiny, as the Goddess of the Green Wind. I don't understand what you're saying. That's right. Don't suddenly ask for something like this from a baby girl. Can I go? You are not a Goddess. I know it's a sudden request. But our world faces a grave danger. Only you can save it. Sorry. I don't know what you're talking about. I don't have such power! You have to wear this. It's so heavy! It suits you, my Goddess. It's an anchor necklace. It is my great masterpiece, Made with secret ingredients, in 3 days without sleeping. Hippocrates-sama is known to everyone in our world. He's the best alchemist there is! An alchemist? I've never met one before. The weight of the anchor increases. When you become negative. It pushes your body forward. I am amazed by this wonderful creation. I don't want it! Only Hippocrates-sama can remove that necklace. Now let's hurry up and go! I don't want to. Let's go, my Goddess. I'm coming too! Wait for me! Hippocrates-sama, the spider's path... We have wasted too much time. Don't worry He controls spacetime, he won't attack us. Not that way. Hurry, Goddess. - Listen. - What? I am not a Goddess. My name is Akane. Is everyone okay? Fine... Not at all! What are we doing here? I wasn't planning on this. There are two entrances in our world. This is the oldest of them. In the past, giant birds appeared. It seems they built on this tall tower. You mean this giant bird... Eggs! She's trying to protect them. Don't Worry. We will not eat your eggs. Really. They're too big anyway. - Did she understand me? - Chii-chan! Don't move. Okay, we'll go down slowly. Are you okay, Akane? The Armored Rat. Mother! The sweaters! You're still doing there terrible things, Zan gu! Hippocrates. Pipo is there too. They really are annoying. What is that thing? Akane! My legs... Hey! Do something. They're terrified! - The eggs! - Don't go! Hippocrates-sama! Here's the sheep grass. Yes! Success! What now? The sheep of the village! They've come to save us. They're huge! Don't move. - Let's get out of here. - Good idea. They really are troublesome. Your egg is safe. I understand. Take care of it! She is a persistent girl! Hippocrates-sama! Thank you for saving us from danger. This is the chief of Cockscomb village and his mother. What a great feeling! Amazing! What is this? It's a field of cockscomb. And in the distance, the village of Cockscomb. This really feels like living in a fairly tale. In this village, we raise sheep and dye the wool with cockscomb to make sweaters and scarves. Dyeing the wool too? How cute! Hello! - Hello. - Hello. What nice colors they are! Thank you. Everything seems so peaceful. What is the danger in this world? - The colors are slowly disappearing. - The colors? The meadows wither, the quality of the wool is deteriorating, and so are the cockscomb. What's wrong? The water. Water? Everything in this world draws its life from water. Life is color. If the water cycle continues, the beautiful colors shine. Hippocrates-sama. O great alchemist. Hippocrates-sama. It's been a long time. Please help us. Hippocrates-sama, everyone says you are our last hope. Kamadoma-sama isn't here, so we're asking for your help. I understand. So I brought with me the Goddess of the Green Wind. Green Wind? The legend? The Goddess! What? Stop joking! 600 years ago, We faced the same situation. The water ran out and the colors disappeared. Everyone was desperate. Then a girl appeared, like the wind She saved the country. People called that girl The Goddess of the Green Wind. This tale was passed on from generation to generation Impossible... This is impossible! I'm not able to save this world! Chii-chan, let's go back. I want to go home. I want to take this for my store. I'm going home, I want to see my dad and mom! What? You want to go back? But the stairs of the tower were destroyed. We need two whole days to reach the other exit. You see? That's why we're staying here tonight. If you please. We have a supper prepared for you. Please follow me. Eat, Please. What about your mother? She's busy with something else. Don't let it worry you, eat. Thanks for the food. This is a chestnut soup! Try it, Akane. Delicious! Right? In fact, my mother and I were going To an exhibition in a nearby town Carrying sweaters with us... The sweaters that were taken from you earlier? Yes, my mother is the best knitter in the village But recently, her eyesight has deteriorated. And those were the last sweaters that she knitted. They stole such precious sweaters? How terrible! For some time, our sweaters haven't sold. Rumors say they've lost their quality and color. But we never bring poor quality products to market! So that the villagers can continue to live on, My mother is knitting a new sweater. We are considering participating in the Sakasatongari market contest. It's a good idea. People from all around the world come together at that market. If you win that competition, your reputation will be restored. Sakasatongari? It's here. But Zan Gu's actions are a difficult problem. They're up to something with that armored rat. Who are they? They appeared around 6 months ago and started causing trouble. Probably thugs from the city of Nibi. The city of Nibi? It's better not to approach. It's a very dangerous city. Stop! You rascal! It went smoothly. You'll work for us again, Voudan. It's impossible to make steel with this scrap. Scary, isn't it? Can you finish by tomorrow morning? I still don't have enough metal. I'll take care of it. You have to succeed at any cost. Is this how you ask for a favor? If you can't... It'd be a serious problem. I'll get you more iron. Let's go, Doropo. Yeah! Here is Cockscomb village. And there, the center of this world, the Eternal Rain Palace. Kings of Eternal Rain have always lived in this palace. The royal family doesn't misuse their power. They've been responsible for managing the water for generations. Thanks for the abundance of water in this world, belong to the Kings of Rain. About 5 years ago, The king and Queen passed away one after the other. They left behind a young orphan Prince. He hasn't been seen at all for the past year or so. Why? Did something happen to him? It's rumored that the Prince is very weak and remains in bed. The loss of his parents must have deeply affected him. The water has been lacking for a few months now. It is said to be due to the the Prince's weakened state. Can't you do anything? You're an alchemist, right? The wizard Kamadoma-sama also lives in the Eternal Rain Palace. In this world, the wizard and the alchemist each protect their own territory, without interfering with each other. A territory war? How ridiculous! So ask the wizard Kamadoma to do something. Chii-chan! Actually... Despite the critical situation, he hasn't come out of his deep sleep! Is it possible that he's dead? No, no, that's not it. Kamadoma-sama stayed awake for 3 years without sleeping, Then one day, he fell asleep. A year has passed and he hasn't yet woken. So he's in hibernation? Yes. - Like a bear! - You're right. Useless! Me too, I want to sleep. Can I? You're too bold. I haven't finished yet! I see. So be brief. If I forced Akane to come here, it is so that she can save the Prince. Me, save the Prince? - How romantic! - Whatever! Akane. This is the Goddess of the Green Wind that appeared 600 years ago. Neither I nor Kamadoma can heal the Prince. Only the Goddess of the Green Wind can. That's a lot! Not enough. You're standing in our way. Return him. Huh? Damn it! Do not use magic if you are not good at it. That's why I train. That one's not a problem. I envy you, you know. I would have liked to have such an adventure at your age. I just want to go home. You don't want to see the Prince? I don't. But, in this world... Someone! Someone! Mother... What is it? Mother is... Excuse me. She hasn't stopped knitting... - Pipo. The medicine. - Yes. - Put her in her bed. - Yes. Please, wait. I absolutely must finish knitting this tonight. You mustn't. I know, my eyesight is deteriorating, my body is getting weaker. But I want to finish this sweater, to present it at the Sakasatongari market. That's impossible! What if something happened to you? You are the village chief. Don't worry about me, think about the future of the village. Here, this will help you feel better. Popo. We will deliver the sweater. No way! It is my mission. You must stay with her. Sakasatongari market is near the Eternal Rain Palace, We'll pass it on our way. Okay, Akane? I still haven't decided... - Okay? - Yeah. Chii-chan! What are you doing? Yoga! The corpse pose. Want to try it? The corpse? No way! It is a wonderful car. Thank you for helping. I'm glad I could assist you. Here's the water and food. Thank you. And what's this? They're warm clothes for crossing cold areas. Hey Popo-san, will your mom be okay? She is exhausted, but she sleeps deeply. Please rest assured. I'm relying on you with this sweater. Yes! I can already feel the sweater's warmth in my arms. It feels full of kindness, it's really wonderful. Thank you so much. I'll tell her what you said. Okay, let's hurry if we're going to be at the competition in time. I've loaded the luggage. Get in quickly. Okay, hurry up and go then. Driver? - Be careful! - Safe travels! - Goodbye. - Goddess! Goodbye, my comfortable friends! - It was a beautiful place. - Yeah. What a change of atmosphere! It got cold all of a sudden. So warm! Plus, it's cute! They look great on you two. So cute! As I feared. What is it? - Get out! - Shouldn't we stay inside? No! Out! Over there. Lie down! Goodness. That was incredible. Thank you so much. No problem. Thank you Hippocrates-san, for protecting us. No need to thank me. Are sandstorms common here? Sometimes they blow through the land of red winds. But I've never seen one so violent before. It's worse because of the drought. There's no more water in this region. That's all I can do today. I'll start again at dawn tomorrow. Okay. Does this mean we're camping out here? That's right. What about the bathroom and toilet? No, no way! This is part of the fun of adventure! Hey, Chii-chan. Hooray! Hippocrates-san, you're amazing! So the alchemist can be useful. We have to make up for lost time. Let's go! Okay! - Akane, let's hurry. - Yeah. The snow is getting dirtier. Yes, time is running out. So warm! Excuse me, are you able to host us tonight? Are you able to pay? I am the alchemist Hippocrates. It's so beautiful. I thought you were a clown. We raised the prices because of the lack of water. You can't shower or use the sink. Just water to drink. Darling! He's Hippocrates the famous alchemist ! Is that so! My deepest apologies. I'll prepare a room for you. With hot water, of course! Can you serve them a hot meal? I'll get you some hot stew! Hippocrates-san. You don't want to eat? I'm going to refuel. After your meal, go to bed. We leave early tomorrow. Travel safe! You drink too much! No alcohol no life! What does that mean? You again! Give us food. Who are you? Don't you know Zan Gu-sama? You really are stupid. What would you like to eat? What you serve to humans. I'll get it right away! Sorry to make you wait! Wow! And the water? There isn't any water. It's a problem for us too... I'll take that too! What's your problem? Thank you. Are you okay? It's not too bad. By the way, you two... What are they up to? You really look like Voudan! My brother told me the details. They're really powerful. With these, we'll surely be able to blow up the well! I don't want any trouble. Understood. How is this? This is fine. You don't need to check for the markings. Go quickly. Zan Gu, what are you up to? This is not your concern, alchemist. I heard you talking about the well at the Eternal Rain Palace. Where the young prince is expected to visit. The unconscious prince is leading us to ruin. Although he is from the rain family, he does not react. If the well explodes, Maybe unexpected water will pour out. Ridiculous! I will not allow it! Damn it! I should have been more careful! More of your tricks, Doropo? But he was about to use magic. He'll return to normal after a while. You're so strong! As soon as I saw you, I knew you weren't from this world. We come from a neighboring world. Do you know about our world? No. But there are tales handed down from long ago. About a world similar to ours, Like a reflection in a mirror. I see... But at some point, your world evolved. And made rapid progress after the invention of the locomotives. Didn't the same happen here? Our world hasn't changed much since the invention of the locomotives. Everything continues slowly as it did before. Why hasn't it changed? Maybe we're all happy with things just as they are. I love living in this world. Watching the snowflakes fall is enough to make me happy. But seeing this beauty has become more and more rare. I wonder if something went wrong? Hasn't Hippocrates returned yet? I'll go look for him. It's getting a little late. I'll come with you. I'll come too. Thank you for telling me all of that, sir. That's strange, it's already loaded with coal. Hippocrates-sama left immediately after buying the coal. Where could he have gone? It's like spring here, it feels so nice! We're in the Buds region. Soon we will arrive at Hippocrates-sama's house. It's also my hometown. You can recognize his house right away! Those balls are our houses, schools and offices. It looks like fruit. They're so cute! But... His house has a pretentious look, exactly like him. How rude! What a terrible habit. I shouldn't rub them together. Could Hippocrates-san have already returned home? That's not possible. The closed windows mean he's not home. He's irresponsible! Hippocrates begged us to accompany him! I did nothing of the sort! In any case, let's hurry. Why are we hurrying? The drop cutting ceremony will be held tomorrow morning. Drop cutting ceremony? Yes. It is absolutely necessary that the Prince takes part in this ceremony. For the water to return... Zan Gu must have passed through there. He probably intends to go to the Sakasatongari market. The palace is just beyond those mountains. Still so far away! Yes. I think we'll arrive before nightfall. Goodness, this fly has been following us since yesterday. The damn thing got away. What a terrifying girl! Oh yes! We'll arrive faster with this path on the left. Is that the place I hit? It's the place I landed! I noticed it thanks to you. You fool! Be careful, Chii-chan! We're close to the edge! This side is no better. That's impossible, Let's turn back! I hate this, but... - We have no other choice. - No way! Wait! Stop! Stop! Stop! Hey, are there any boys you like in your class? What? Let's chat a little? No, nobody. I don't care about boys. In a year or two, you'll surely fall in love with one of them. - There's no way. - There is! You're still only a child. You know nothing about love. Look who's talking. "He told me he loved my free spirit! But I was too free for him. He's horrible, don't you agree Midori-san?" Ah yes, I said that. Wait! Wait! I will be happy one day! How nice to drive on a bridge that doesn't rock. Truly! Keep going until we fly. Sure! What! I was so scared. You could have warned me. I didn't think you would believe me. What do we do now? We're going to be transported. What? By who? This allows you to breathe underwater, and it's waterproof. Underwater? Let's go, follow me. Okay. Isn't that dangerous? We'll see! Okay, I'll go on ahead. The water level has dropped here too. Where did the Duke go? He just went to see the Prince. - The key. - As you wish. The Prince isn't here yet? No... Ron isn't here either. Goodness, Kamadoma-sama really is irresponsible. Sleeping while the Prince is locked in an iron doll. The Prince must return to his body Before the day of the drop cutting ceremony. That's what is planned. Let's go to the ceremony. Where? At the Sakasatongari well. The Prince is there? Does that mean he's healed? Hard to say... without seeing him in person. Well, let's go to Sakasatongari anyway. This fly again... Yes, it's me. A student should understand that. He has a pretentious mustache. Chase it away from me. Excuse me. Shoo! Traitor! A cat? Kamadoma-sama is a great lover of cats. People from outside must pass an inspection in this place. Inspection? Like immigration inspection. Next! Stand here. What is this package? It's a sweater, to participate in the contest. You can pass. Wait! They cannot pass! - Gorobeh! - You're right! The trial is starting. The trial? Are you serious, Gorobeh? Are you laughing at me? No no. Absolutely not. By the way, I have something for you. COD WITH CHEESE Here. Good, good! A real witch. Hey! Don't let her tame you! The trial! The trial! You! Guilty. Why? Please wait! She is... What? What did Akane do? You pulled the tail of a completely innocent cat. It is true? Therefore, I sentence you to have your tail pulled. You won't do it any more? I promise! I'll never do it again! Proof of love! Chii-chan, you laughed too much! Be kinder to Gorobeh. I'm so excited! Can we take a look at the stalls? What about the sweater contest? Come on, just a little look around. You're a real kid. Where should I take this? Over there. I'm going to the cat tent, at the bottom. Don't go too far Understood! So fast! What's that? The well of Eternal Rain. It's where the Prince prepares for the drop cutting ceremony. This please. It's an excellent quality sweater, Dyed with flowers from Cockscomb, very warm... Kamadoma-sama hasn't woken up. The prince still isn't back to normal. But the ceremony must take place... No matter what it takes! How do we going to get inside? Kamadoma-sama! These are royal seashells. They go really well with wine. Want to trade? Super practical moist wipes. This gets really warm. And this, you'll trade it? Where did Chii-chan go? The prince is said to have returned. I was so worried. They said he had fallen ill. Ill or not, he has to hold the ceremony. You're right. Has the drop cutting ceremony ever failed? Yes, a few times in our long history. What happens if it fails? Hey! Grab that little brat! Damn! - It's him! - Follow him! Hurry! I think I know him. We were in the same class. His name is Ron. He was always looking for a fight. After I graduate? I want to become an alchemist. So then, I'll become the world's greatest magician! He is said to have become a student of Kamadoma-sama, Despite his appearance being totally different. Another checkpoint! They'll definitely stop him. Why not? The cats seem to be sleeping. The armored rat is here... Yes, Zan Gu must be too. I stole some stuff to eat. The time has come. What are they planning? I'll read their lips. Don't move. "There'll be no problem! With the new shell, the armored rat will easily destroy the well. It'll be fun too!" This is serious! They plan to destroy it! How serious? That well, The whole world relies on it. You don't want to eat? I understand how you feel, but aren't you determined to do it? "The well must disappear to put an end to my suffering" isn't that right? The fireflies are dying. Who cares? They're just fireflies! What's wrong? Are you angry? It doesn't matter anyway. What are you doing here? Entering here is forbidden! Kamadoma-sama! Quickly! Turn the prince back to normal! I slept well. Let me make this clear for you... That is not the Prince. It's a bad magic trick. This is it's original appearance. Where did they go? Well, I'll wait here. They shouldn't be late. I got a big haul. That's impossible, we can't stop them on our own. A cannon with no shell is no use to them. I'll find a way to distract them, Use that opportunity to steal the shell. This guy is a real problem... Oh, it's a fellow fly. But a fly that likes carrots? How strange! A fellow fly? I really am becoming one of them! She's putting herself in danger. Maybe the anchor pendant is working too well. Did you decide? Will you do it? You won't wait until tomorrow, in front of the crowd? Hey, Zan Gu! You think you understand me? I don't understand! I don't, but... You are nothing more than a failed magician. You're only able to turn me into this hideous monster. Sorry... Sorry... But I did try my best. To please you, to please you, my prince! Hey, you, do something! You're a magician, right? But, but... You told me you could do it! Give me back my body! Come on, hurry up! I am Zan Gu I am no longer a Prince! Kamadoma-sama will wake up soon. He will punish me. Should we blow up Kamadoma too? Of course not! Stop! Isn't the well precious? Don't destroy it. Stay out of this. Without water from the well, the whole world will dry up! Shut up! Shut up! This doesn't concern you! Ron. It's been a long time hasn't it? What? Ron? I don't know that name. I know you remember that name. If you destroy the well, Terrible things will happen. The forest where we grew up will disappear. Our friends and families would suffer. You are not a friend of mine! I think of you as a friend. Prince and Ron seem to be very close to here. - Really? - Let's go find them now. No, the Prince must decide for himself. But the magic must be dispelled first... Shut up! Shut up! You're only fooling yourself, tiny! Ron! Hippocrates-san! Akane! Hippocrates-sama! Careful. Give him space. Pipo, the carrot. Okay! Ron! Ron! Let's go out! Hippocrates-sama! Stop! Let me out. Try to stop me. If you are the Goddess of the Green Wind, try to stop me. They look terrified, Powerless to do anything... They look like you. Don't! They don't have long to live. That's no reason. Hold on. I will break through the wall. Stand aside. You don't have to go through with this! First squad, above! The others, go below. I know you must have been afraid. Afraid of the drop cutting ceremony. It was an unavoidable fate. But you didn't want to accept it. My father, my grandfather, my great-grandfather, all succeeded. I knew that one day, my turn would come. But one day I started to rebel. I had lost both of my parents. I would leave the palace to go to the city of Nibi. I met bad people who lived in the streets of that city. As the ceremony drew closer, The fear and the anger grew inside me. Before Kamadoma's year of sleep was to begin, He became very worried. And he locked me inside an iron doll. Do you think that by destroying the well, your fear and anger will disappear? I'll help you with the ceremony. They say that I'm the Goddess of the Green Wind. You said it too. So I'll help you. And everything will be fine. I passed through many towns and villages before arriving here. I was surprised by how beautiful they are. The colors in this world are beautiful! In my world science has greatly advanced. It's very convenient, but also very inconvenient. I want to be excited about the color of the flowers... To fall in love with the stars in the night sky... My world has forgotten such a way of life. So please, Protect this world. Only you can do it. You are no longer Zan Gu. I'm back. The Prince has returned! Sorry I left you alone. You were scared ? No. Hippocrates-san, I want the Prince to have an anchor pendant too. I know making them is a secret process... But it's this anchor that gave me courage. Hippocrates-san, can you make another? You are the greatest alchemist in the world. But to make it, I would need my workshop. Sorry, Chii-chan. Don't worry. Hurry and get in. What's that? A precious fuel made from dragon droppings. Dragon droppings? We'll fly. The workshop is upstairs. I lit the fire. Slowly. Mix it well. You have to capture the moonlight. But most important of all, - Put your heart into it. - Okay. Hippocrates-sama. Keep going. By the way, where did you go after the snowy city? We have arrived. Kamadoma-sama. It's time to get dressed. Are you ready? Stop! Oh, it's Hippocrates-sama! Excuse me. - What is it? - Let them be. Akane. Sorry I'm late. This is an anchor pendant. May I? Yes. I'm wearing the same. When you lose hope, it pushes your body forward. It helped me move forward, And I was able to meet you. Believe me. Yes, I believe you. Give the Goddess of the Green Wind her cloak. Understood. What happens if he fails the drop cutting ceremony? He loses his life. What? But his sacrifice will not be in vain. The whole world will be blessed with water until the next generation. The royal family is connected to the water in this way. The Prince Is well aware of this. Are you scared? No... What? The ceremony has failed. I have to sacrifice my life to this well. Wait! That's too cruel! Stop this! Do you say that there is no cruelty in your world? It's okay, Akane. Thank you, goodbye. Akane! Well done, Prince. I see in you the determination of the Rain King. Congratulations. You should thank her. She's a brave girl. Yes. Here. Akane! It's okay, we're not falling any more. Akane. Let me go, I have to cut the drops! The handprint was left there by the Goddess of the Green Wind 600 years ago. We had just repaired it. It's strange, Goddesses all trip in the same place. I must return the anchor to you. There is no need. It has already disappeared. The anchor gave you a chance. But you moved forward of your own free will. So it was a trick? How rude! No matter how good the tools, The user's heart is what matters most. I'm still not convinced. - Anyway, let's go. - Yeah. With your permission... Thank you so much. You're welcome. Hippocrates-sama! Are you jealous? You fool! Here, Akane. This is a gift from the King of Rain to his guests. Thank you so much. - Pipo. - Yes. We've been gone for 3 days. Midori-san must be worried. That's right. That won't be a problem. A day in this world is only an hour in your own. Really? What if we come back here one day? We would no longer be here. But this world, would not have changed. This is certain. This music will guide you. Now, go on ahead quickly. And don't look back. Akane-san! Chii-san! Thank you Hippocrates-san, Pipo! Ah! You were there the whole time? Chii-chan, I'm going home. Okay, travel safe. Who are you? The customer you had earlier. You recommended this lamp. I took it home, it's really wonderful. So I'd really like to buy it. Ah, you had disappeared when I returned. They were out on their own, so I got a vase from the kitchen. You can take it. Can you watch the store for a while? I need to sleep. Wait! Play something that helps you sleep. - I'm back. - Welcome home. Mom, thanks for the wonderful birthday gift. Hey, mom. Isn't the world big. It is big. Isn't the world beautiful. It is beautiful. I fell asleep after seeing my mom again after so long. My world has expanded a little, That's just how I feel... Maybe.
