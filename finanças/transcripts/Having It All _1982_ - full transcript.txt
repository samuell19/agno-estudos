Oh darling, Sable looks so hungry. Would you feed her? - Okay. Mrs. Montrose, what are you doing? - I just wanna know the weather. - Then open the window. Don't steal our paper, huh? - But it just goes to waste lying on the doormat. - It is lying on the doormat waiting for me to pick it up. - Well, good neighbors share. - No, they don't. They subscribe. - So chintzy. - Mrs. Montrose? - Again. - Thank you, darling. (Peter humming) Well thank you, Monique. - Thank you. Thank you. - Thank you, darling. Darling. - Hm? - No cream? - No, no, no, no, no. That's okay, I thought I'd try it black. - All right. Here darling, here's the croissants. But they're your favorite, they're from Zabar's. - No, I'm just not hungry this morning, darling. Honestly. - All right. - You look beautiful this morning, Thera. - Thank you, Peter. - You know, I'm gonna fly to Houston today for that wine importers convention. Would you like to come along? - With you on a business trip? - Yeah, it'll be nice for a change. - It'd be wonderful, but I have to go to Los Angeles today. - Again? I mean, you've been gone every weekend now for-- - Oh, darling, it's a new business, you know. They need me there all the time. - Honey, all the traveling's gonna wear you down. - Ah, I feel like a girl. - You know, you are as beautiful and surprising to me today as the day I met you. You don't change. - Thank you, Peter. Oh, I have to go. I really have to rush. I got a buyer from Neiman's meeting in 27 minutes. I'll call you from Los Angeles. - All right. I'll miss ya. (soft string music) - You'll miss me? - Mm-hm. - That's what I thought you said. I love you, Peter. - What's the matter there? It doesn't hang right. - It hangs fine, perfect. - No, no, no, no, Jon, on the bodice. It hangs funny. We used the wrong stitch. - You're looking at it funny. It's fine. - How long have you been with this company? - Long enough. - Well I've been here longer and I think I have a far more professional eye-- - Well, in the last three months I think you've gotten a little myopic. - Myopic? You're opic. Where did you go to-- - Morning, gorgeous girl. Ooh ooh! Hmm. I don't know, what if we added, I don't know, a train? I don't mean like a wedding dress-- - Maybe a V-shape. - Raise your arms, Cheri, like you're in flight. Ooh, that's good. Oh, that's lovely. Jon, you're gonna have to restitch the bodice. It doesn't hang right. What's on the agenda today? - Let's see, you've got an interview at 10:00 and a meeting with makeup. Oh, the silks came in. I'm setting those up at 11:00. - Oh, good! Good, good, good. What about the hair people for the show? - 11:15, and then you have lunch with you mother. - Ooh? - (laughs) Gotcha. Then meeting, meeting, meeting. - Oh, cancel the last one. - Done. And then a two o'clock exercise class and flight to LA at four o'clock. Why don't you just buy an airplane? - Would you lower that? Lower the belt a little. See, there's too much fabric under there. Oh, that's better. - Thera, could I talk to you privately today? I'm kinda sweating something. - Sure, meet me in exercise class. We'll sweat it together. (energetic music) - Five, six, seven, eight, and breathe. Two, three, and stretch. Five, six, seven, eight, exhale. Two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, and burn. Two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. Come on, stretch! - So what's goin' on? - Lloyd asked me to move in with him. - Which one's Lloyd? - You remember Lloyd! Preppy, loafers, the one with the half share in the house in East Hampton. - Not exactly the man of your dreams. - (laughing) Oh hey, I don't dream about men. I dream about career moves, Tony awards, things like that. - [Instructor] Okay, girls, stop talking. Burn that fat, shake up the flab. - So what are you gonna do? - I don't know. I'd move in with him tomorrow and marry him the next day if I thought we could end up like you and Peter. - What do you mean? - You're like the Duke of Windsor and Mrs. Simpson, for God's sake. I can just see you in your penthouse at night gazing worshipfully at each other across matching branded snuff tunics. You've got the perfect marriage. What's your secret? (Thera laughs) (upbeat music) - [Attendant On Intercom] In preparation for our arrival in Los Angeles, will all passengers please return to their seats and fasten their seatbelts. (man on intercom chattering indistinctly) (gentle instrumental music) - I could live like this. I am, I'm living like this! (laughs) - Relaxed? - Oh, I'm so relaxed, baby. I've been in town three days but I haven't even been in the office once yet. - You ever thought about giving up one of the offices? Like, oh, New York maybe? - Oh, jealous? - I know, I know you're a bi-coastal. It's just that I'd like to see you more than this. - You can see all there is right after work. - How about right now? - Sure. If you can catch me. (laughs) (Thera squealing) (soft instrumental music) One second. - Do you notice anything different about me? - I don't see anything. - Huh? - Hm-mm. - Take a guess. - You lost a baby tooth. - Hey. - Hey. (laughing) Okay, I give. What? (Thera gasps) - I finally finished them. Thera Enright is mine. Your turn. Do me. - Do you. - Say it. - Jess Enright, is mine. - Yay! (Dace screaming) - Oh, Dace! - 'Scuse me. I have to... - Dace! What are you doing here? - Oh, well, I just came out a day early to see if I could help you, but it, it seems like you're handling everythi, oh, right, Dace. - Don't go away, Jace! Dace. Stay here, this is Jace. This is Da... - Jess. - Jess! This is Jess, this is Mr. Enright. He, he does a strip for me. - Ah. - I don't mean he does, he just, he strips. No, no, he has a comic strip, a funny strip. You know, the kind you read in the paper. - Oh, oh yeah, I've seen those in the papers, yeah. - Yes. - Honey. - Yes? - Would you leave this to me? - Sure. Honey. - I've heard a lot about you. Hi. - Hi. - Yes, Jess was just doing, Mr. Enright was just working on our Thera Sport logo. We were just doing some business together. - She dragged me along so she had some company while she worked. But we're celebrating now. - Celebrating? - Celebrating. (laughs) - [Jess] Our three-month anniversary. - Yes. - Oh, how nice. Since you met? - Well no, since we got married. - Since you got, married? (playful music) (nervous laughing) (Dace laughing) Amazing. - Oh, it's yours anytime. - Incredible. - Company pays for it. I don't really use it. - You have two husbands! - Oh, I don't suppose there's any way you could forget about that? - About bigamy? - Oh, please don't say that word! - Oh, I love the word! It reeks of sin. Bigamy! - Shhh! - It's fabulous. - No, it's not fabulous, Dace. It's a mess! I don't even know how I got myself mixed up in it. - How did you get yourself mixed up in it? - Ooh! - Peter had an affair. - No, no, Peter did not have an affair. Peter had lots of affairs. And then he really had an affair. - Oh. And so heartbroken, you turned to Jess. It was a wild and glorious thing and it made you feel young and beautiful again. - Dace, I'm gonna take the television set outta your office. - Sorry. - He said, Thera, I'm sorry. I don't wanna be married to you anymore. I'm in love with another woman. You'll like her, she's wonderful. I cried all the way through the 1812 Overture. - Oh, Thera! - So he said he wanted a divorce as fast as possible and that he'd go to the Dominican Republic to get it. So I came out here to LA, and there was Jess. I mean, he just, (forcefully exhales) and we fell so in love, I mean so in love. And it got very serious and he said he wanted marriage or nothing, and I said okay. Then Peter decides he doesn't want a divorce. - Oh no. - See, I knew right then I shoulda told 'em both. I knew it. But I didn't because I just didn't wanna lose either one of 'em. - It's perfectly understandable. - Is it? Well, then explain it to me because I don't understand it. You see, I'm really not this kind of a person. Dace, I believe in loyalty and fidelity and honesty. - And marriage. (Thera groans) - Jess just made me feel like a whole new person, you know? I just love him so much. But I love Peter too. And Peter loves me. I mean, he hasn't said the words I love you for a lotta years, but he loves me I think. - Yeah, but after what he did you could never really trust him again, could you? (Thera sighs) I mean, what if you actually gave up Jess and then Peter had another serious affair and then really did divorce you? Then where would you be? - Ooh, alone. - Totally. Well, you'd better give me Jess's phone number so I can reach you when Peter calls here. - You'll help me? - Of course! Now, what do we do if Jess shows up in New York? - Oh, Jess won't come to New York. He hates New York. - Well, what if he calls you at home in New York? - Peter and I have separate lines. Mine's on an answering machine. - An answering machine? You're trusting your fate to an answering machine? What if Peter picks up your line? - Well, he won't. He gets enough aggravation from his own line. - You've gotta get rid of the answering machine. Get a pickup service and pay off the head girl. - Sooner or later this has gotta stop, Dace. I cannot go on with this indefinitely. - But how are you gonna choose? Peter is mature and sophisticated. Jess is wild and spontaneous. With Peter you can share, but with Jess you can explore. Oh, how can you possibly decide between them? And why should you? You've got the best of both worlds! - Yeah, but I'm living a lie. - Wouldn't you be lying if you said you loved one and not the other? It's unrealistic to think that any one man can satisfy all your needs. - Yeah, but you can't have your cake and eat it too. Can you? (upbeat music) - [Attendant On Intercom] Ladies and gentlemen, we are beginning our descent into the New York area. Will all passengers please return to their seat and fasten their seatbelts. (elevator dings) - Aah! (sniffing) Mm! Jess. (elevator dinging) Peter! (lively instrumental music) (closet objects clattering) Ooh! (Thera shrieks) Oh God! (elevator dings) - Mrs. Montrose. - (laughing) Hello, Mr. Baylin. I was just picking up my flowers. - Mrs. Montrose, you're a very, very wealthy woman. Look, your husband left you an awful lotta money. First you steal my paper, then you steal my groceries, now you're stealing my fl, do you want my garbage next, is that what you want? - No, no, no, Mr. Baylin, your wife threw them away. - They were not thrown away. - Oh, well, there she is! She'll tell you. She did, she threw, I found them under the rug. She threw them away. - Mrs. Montrose, my wife would not throw away flowers that I sent her, would you? - That you sent me? Well, heavens no! I would never throw away flowers that you sent me, Peter. - Huh? - Now, how do you know that these are not for me anyway? - Mrs. Montrose, I ordered a dozen salmon pink roses and the card says Thera, my darling wife. - Is this your handwriting? - No, Mrs. Montrose, it's not my handwriting. I ordered them by phone. Now how many people do you think would say Thera, my darling wife, hm? Now just give 'em back. Thank you. - Such neighbors! - Here, damn it. (door bangs shut) - Oh Peter, they're just beautiful. But Peter, you only send me flowers on our anniversary. - This isn't about our anniversary, Thera. You see, I've been a fool. I realize now what I've put you through. I mean, what would I want with another woman? - Oh Peter, that's in the past, really. I've let it go. You want some dessert? - No, you haven't let it go. I mean, you've buried yourself in extra work and all those trips to the coast. - It hurt at the time, it did, it hurt. But I'm fine now. Listen, they have coeur a la creme-- - What more could I want in another woman than I already have in you? I mean, what was I thinking? - Well, you weren't thinking, Peter. I mean, you were just being human, it's okay. They have a-- - I was being an idiot. Look, I almost ruined our marriage, Thera, and the thing that kills me, the thing that kills me is the fact that I know that you would have never done something like that to me. - Crepe Suzette? - Thera. Just listen to me. Look, I tried it, and I thought it would be better somewhere else, but uh-uh. It just never felt as good. It just never felt the same. I just wish that I didn't have to go through that to get here. No, but I did. I know now for sure. It's you. It's you. It's us. I'm home. Honey, you're shaking. - Well, I mean, I'm really not used to this from you, Peter. - I wish I thought of this years ago. - So do I. (romantic string music) Sweetheart. (giggles) We're here. - What's that? - My, my, my, my, my! Twice in one day? What did I do to deserve this? - Honey, who are they from? - From? - Honey, come on, open the card. Thera, let me see the card. Thera. Thera, my darling. I do not believe this. Thera, this is the end. It's all over. - Thera, my darling wife. Peter-- - Those damn florists! - [Thera] Florists? - If they think they're gonna double bill me. - Florists. - Do you know what I'm gonna do? I'll get-- - Florists! Yes, darling, you're gonna come in, you're gonna get comfy with me. Is that good? - Yeah. - That's good. Come on, Peter. We're home, Sabe. (phone ringing) My service will get it. - You got a service? - Mm-hm. - Damn! - No, I'll get it. Hello? - Is this my delicious wife? - Oh, yes! Who's calling? - Uh, Thera, it's your husband. - Oh, good. Mm. - Baby, I was just lying here thinking about you. - Oh, good. - [Jess] Thinking about kissing every inch of you. - Oh. - Your shoulders and your knees. Thinking about your mouth, about your neck. - Oh, we'll go over that part, that part, both parts in the morning. - Are you okay? - No, no, no, yes. I'm half asleep. - [Jess] Did you get my flowers? - Oh, noo. - Okay, I'll reorder them tomorrow. - I mean, yes, yes! They came in, they're coming in, thank you very much. - Okay, you sleep well. Dream of me. I love you. - Yes, yes, I think so too. Having trouble filling an order. - Thera. - Huh? - I love you. (gentle wind instrument music) - [Photographer] Okay, honey, that's it. A little more profile. Keep your chin up. That's it. Okay, sweetheart, a little more seductive now. Okay, watch the champagne. Very good. Okay, fellas. - No, wait a minute. Tom, David, stand up. Here, it's okay. Lie down and relax back there. Tom, you come over here, sit down. David, just lie right down in there next to her. Spread your hair here, that's good. Now relax, lounge, like Garbo with Camille but without the coughing. Gentlemen, you're getting ready to pour her some champagne. Now tell yourself you're doing them a favor, right? You're doing them a favor, and really be wooing her, okay? Wooing her, wooing her. Loving her, loving her, that's it. - Mrs. Baylin? - Hm? - Mr.Baylin's here to take you to lunch. He's on his way up. - He is? Oh, thank you, Amy. Can't believe this! Every day he wants to take me to lunch. What's going on with him? - Maybe he knows. - What do you mean? - About Jess, unconsciously. I read an article someplace that when you've got something going on the side, your mate picks up on it even though they won't admit the ugly truth even to themselves. - No, really? Do you think so? Teasingly, tease, yes, tease. - Mrs. Baylin? - Yes? - Mr. Enright's on the phone. He's on three-oh. He's called three times already. He says it's urgent. - Oh, okay, I'll take it. - And Mr. Baylin's here. - Oh, Peter! Hi, darling. Oh, I'm so happy to see you, darling. I've got an urgent phone call but I'll be with you in a minute, okay? Talk to him, quick! Jess? Hi, Jess. - Hi, cutie. I was just on my way out the door to guess where? - Where? - New York. - This New York? - The very same. I'm just dyin' to see ya. - Looks pretty good for this month, huh? - Yeah, but I thought you hated New York. - Well, I thought I'd give you a chance to change my mind. - But I can't. - Well, you can try. - No, no, no, I mean, you can't. You can't come to New York, darling, because, because, because I'm on my way to LA. Right as we talk, Amy is booking the seats and, and she'll call you and tell you what flight it, oh, would you mind holding on just a moment, please? Would you mind just holding on? Just one minute please. Darling! - Hi, darling. - I'm so sorry I'm involved, sweetheart. - It's okay, I know you're tied up. - You do? - And Dace has offered to take me to lunch. - She has? Oh, good thinking, Dace! You two have a really good time. I wish I could join you, yes. Loves martinis. Find out what he knows. - Martinis, okay. - Have fun! Bye. (laughs) Jess? I'm really sorry, things got busy here. I'm gonna be on my way in just a little while and I'll see ya soon. I sure love you. Bye. - You too, okay, bye. (sighs) - No, the attitude isn't right. It isn't right at all. Let me see if I can show you what we're tryin' for, okay? It's just, it's got these two gorgeous men here, right? I mean, look at these two men. They're beautiful. And you just gotta, you gotta relax and enjoy it, all right? Just put your head down there. (laughing) Right? (camera clicking) Are you sure? Ooh, okay. No, no, I'll take smoking if that's all they have left. Okay, thanks, Amy. - Surprise! I was just walking home so I thought I'd pop in. - But you live 82 blocks away, Mom. - I knew it. Whenever you call me mom instead of mother, it means you really wanna talk. I sensed it, right there in the shoe department at Macy's. Look. - Oh, those are so cute! I'm sorry, darling, I'm running. - Thera. - No, it's just that I'm on a very tight schedule, but everything's wonderful, don't worry. - Is it? - Yes. I just have to catch a plane. - I know you, Theresa. Ever since you were a little girl every time you said everything was wonderful, usually everything was not. When I see someone burying herself in work, it's a pretty good guess that what she really needs is a-- - What I need is a twin. Goodbye, Mother. - Twin? - Yes, I've got to get you going, sweetheart. - [Marney] All right, I am going. What do you mean a twin? - A twin, I need a double. It has nothing to do with the fact of not wanting to talk to you, but you see, you come by when I don't expect you. - Thera, you never talk to me. - Here, darling, I'm talking to you. We will talk, darling. (Dace laughing) - Hello, Da, Dace. - Hi. - Hello, Peter. - Mother. - Straight home, Mother. How was lunch? - [Peter] Oh, well she'll tell you all about it. Look, I gotta get back to work so I'll talk to you later. - Oh darling, darling, I'm sorry. I've gotta go to Los Angeles today. I just found out. - Wait a second, I'm going to Japan today with a stop over in LA. I told you, don't you remember? - Oh no, I don't remember at all. - What flight are you on? - What flight? Oh, well actually, I think-- - Flight seven at three. - Flight seven at three. - Book me a seat next to Thera, Amy, huh? No, that's great for us because we can have a leisurely drink at LAX before my connecting flight. - Oh, that's wonderful. - You see, I have something I think we should discuss. - Yes? - Mm-hm. I'll talk to you later. - I'll talk to you later, Peter. - Okay. - Absolutely. - Dace, nice to see you. - Uh-huh. - Thank you for a very interesting lunch. - Oh, Peter, I apologize about the olives and I insist on paying that woman's dry cleaning bill, do you hear me? I insist on it. - No problem. - (laughing) Okay. - Okay, you all right? - Goodbye, darling, have a wonderful afternoon. - Bye, darling. - Bye. Amy, put on a pot of coffee and meet me in my office. (Dace laughing) - I just love lunch, don't you? - I love it. - Lunch is so underrated. Poor, poor little lunch. - Poor little lunch. - Whoa! - Whoa. (Dace groans) So what happened? - Oh, Thera, I told him. - You told him what? - I didn't mean to. I guess it was all the martinis. I told him all about it. - You told him all about what? - I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Thera. (sobbing) Oh, I can't believe I did this! I guess that's it for me. - Dace. You didn't tell him about me and Jess. Dace! You didn't tell him about me and Jess! - Jess wasn't there. Peter was a perfect gentleman about it, too. - Ooh no, you told him! You told him! - Yes, I told him. I told him that ever since I first laid eyes on him I've had this thing for him. Oh God! - You told him that you have this thing for him? - Oh, Thera! - Dace! - Oh, Thera. - Oh Dace, Dace! Oh, that's wonderful, Dace! That's wonderful! - Mrs. Baylin? - Yes, Amy. - [Amy] You're confirmed on the three o'clock with Mr. Baylin. - Ooh Amy, thank you, that's wonderful. Sober up, Dace, I'm gonna need your help. All right. Okay. When is the last nonstop flight to Los Angeles? - 7:15, but it's booked up. They're all booked except the flight you're on and the one after that. - Okay, when is that one? - 3:30. - All right, 3:30. Call Mr. Enright and tell him I'll be on that one. - So you want me to change your and Mr. Baylin's reservations? - No. - But then-- - Please, Amy, just do it, please. All right, okay. Now, I will have 15 minutes to see Peter off, then I'll get back to the gate before Jess arrives. (sighs) You think I can do it? (lively instrumental music) - Right on schedule. Let's find the cocktail lounge. I think it's over there. - Oh, but darling, you'd better head straight for your plane, you only have an hour. - Darling, that leaves a half hour to kill, it's okay. - But sweetheart, what about your bags? - I checked 'em through. - Oh. Oh, but don't you have to get your seats? - Darling, would you relax? I got my seat assignment last week. We'll have time for a nice leisurely drink and a talk, okay? - Oh, all right. - I'll have scotch on the rocks, she'll have whiskey, light ice, short straw please. - Oh no, Peter, thank you, I don't want a drink. - Okay, just the scotch. What I wanted to tell you was this is absolutely my last trip to Japan. - Really? Why, what happened? - I wanna spend some more time with you. I'm curtailing all other unnecessary travel too. You know, that way I'll be able to take some of these trips out to LA with you. We'll read on the beach, we'll get some sun. You and I just don't do enough of that. - Ooh. Well, we're both awfully busy, aren't we? - Yeah, we're too busy. And that's why it was so great tonight, you know? Way up there with no phones and nothing to do but just be together. It's gonna be wonderful, Thera, just you and I together, all the time. - All the time. (laughs) Where's that lady with your drink? - Oh, here she is. Oh, thanks. - You know, I just remembered. You have to go all the way over to the international side. - It's just 10 minutes in the shuttle. - [Thera] But, but, but what if they discontinued the shuttle? - Then I'll grab a cab. - But you can never find a cab in LA. - [Peter] Honey, there's always cabs at the airport. Look, if it'll make you more comfortable, okay, okay, we'll go. - That's all I got. - Right after you've had a drink. - After I've had a drink? - I mean, you're right, Peter. What are we rushing around for? Life goes too fast as it is. We should all take time to just smell the roses. - Thanks a lot. - At the airport? - But then again, they have roses in Japan. Come on, Peter. - Thera, Thera, wait a second, where are you going? Thera, it's this way. - [Man On Intercom] Passengers holding tickets on Eastern Airlines Flight 122 may proceed directly to gate 6B. - Honey, where are you going? The international side is that way. - They moved it. - Huh? - And then they put it back. - Honey, all this flying back and forth is beginning to get to you. Now take it easy, you've got to slow down. - Not quite yet, darling. This is gonna be an incredible trip for you, darling. And don't miss your plane, darling. You better hurry, darling. - I'm gonna miss you. - I'm gonna miss you too, darling. - Okay, darling. - I love you so. Right, call me, darling. Please do. Bye, darling. Bye, Peter. (lively instrumental music) - [Man On Intercom] Announcing the arrival of Flight 121, nonstop service from New York at Gate 12. (Thera shrieks) - My glove! Thank you. (alarm buzzing) Hold this for me. (alarm buzzing) (alarm buzzing) Okay? - Yes. - Ooh, thank you! - [Man On Intercom] Announcing the arrival of Flight 121, nonstop service from New York at Gate 12. - Sweetheart! Sweetheart. - For a minute, I thought you missed the plane. How was the flight? - Oh, I slept all the way. (laughs) - Eat! - No, honey. - [Jess] Yes! (Thera laughing) - Ooh. - Here. - No, (laughing) I don't want anymore food. - Yes, eat. - No more food! - But wait, yes, there's more. That's a hint. - What? - It's a surprise. - What's my surprise? - Special dessert, ta-dum! (Thera gasps) - S'mores? Jess, how did you know about s'mores? - Summer camp. - Huh? Did you go East to camp? - Honey, we have camp in California just like in civilization. - Really? - Yeah. It's where you play tennis and ride horses when your folks are gettin' divorced. ♪ Camp Winnapoosaki, how we love your shining waters ♪ ♪ Waters, waters ♪ - Charming. - Do you know, do you know that I was relay champ in toad hop and spider crawl two years in a row? Undefeated! No one could beat me. - Undefeated, huh? - Yeah. - Until right now. Up! - Why? What's up? - Get up, buddy. - Yeah? (laughing) - You see that log? - Yeah. - Okay, toad hop to the log, spider crawl back. - You got it. - Are you ready? - Yep. - On your mark. - Okay. - Get set. (Thera shrieking) Ribbit, ribbit, ribbit! - I'm gonna beat you. - Ribbit! - Camp Winnapoosaki is winning, is winning! - I'm gonna-- - I'm gonna-- (Thera screams) Camp Winnapoosaki! - Okay, okay, this time-- - Never again. - My specialty. - What? - Wheelbarrow. - No! - Yes! (Thera screaming) Move it! (laughs) (Thera shrieks) (both grunt) (laughing) (Jess groans) Now, you wanna know what I used to do at camp? - I can imagine, but why don't you tell me? - Late at night, in the pitch dark, we'd sneak out of our bunks and go down to the beach. - Right. - Climb over the rocks, sneak over the next cove, into the girls' cabins, knock on the door, and they'd let us in. - (laughing) They'd let you in. And then what'd you do? (gentle instrumental music) - Make it a jacuzzi. - (laughing) Hi, Tonsha. I'm having another extra day next week. Hi. - Hi. How was your morning by the sea? - Oh, it was delicious. You should try kicking back sometime. - Well, somebody's gotta plow the fields. - Oh! In acknowledgement of service above and beyond the call. - For me? Ooh, peach ice cream? That's my favorite. How did you know I liked peach ice cream? - I told him. - Oh. - Mr. Baylin. - How you doin'? - Where we going today, sir? - Downtown, Thera Sport. - That one of those new racquetball places? - (laughing) No, fashion line. I'm gonna surprise my wife. - Very good, sir. - Don't you think it's a little fancy for sportswear? - These aren't for Thera Sport, these are for New York Thera. - Oh, then your name goes on the label. - No, no, no, no, Thera's name goes on the label. My name goes on the paycheck for the the usual amount. - Uh-huh. - Ooh, I like that. - Thank you. - Yeah. Baby, did you know that Dace and I went to the same art school? - Oh, isn't that nice. Could I have some ice cream? - Sure. - Thank you. - Uh, well, just as soon as I show Jess the rest of my sketches. This is an oversized shirt, and this is a jumpsuit, and a great bomber jacket. - [Jess] That's terrific. - What are you doing? Some new exercises for crows feet? Ooh! Ooh, look it, look, look at her leisurewear. Look at Dace's leisurewear and some of her swimwear and I'll see ya in a little while. - A nice cut here. - Oh, that's terrific. - Yeah. - Oh yeah. - I like this one especially-- - Darling! (laughing) - Hey. - Darling! - Are you all right? What's wrong with your hair? - What are you doing back? - Well, you've heard of shuffling off to Buffalo. I'm gonna nap you off to Napa. - [Thera] Ooh! (laughs) - And I'd like to design things that, you know, would look good on me. - Who's that? - Who? Oh, that? Ah, ah, I, uh... - Yeah, that guy. What is he, an accountant or something? - That's who it is, that's Thera's accountant, that's right. - What's at Napa? - We're gonna spend a four-day gourmet Thanksgiving weekend at the Fiorno Vineyards. I'm introducing seven new French imports. - Oh! - Every important wine critic in America's gonna be there. - Ooh! (laughing) - You see, there's so much I don't know about this woman. - (laughing) Yeah, well, you did tie the knot awfully fast. - But I was ready for a real commitment. I mean, I'd spent 10 years going through all the stages that lead up to, and how often can you expect to find someone who's right for you? And there's only one Thera. - Unfortunately for her. (laughing) - They're gonna put us up at the Domaine Chateau. - [Thera] Oh. - And we're gonna have dinner at Auberge du Soleil. - Sounds terrified. - What? - Terrific, sounds terrific, Peter. - Ow! Ow! - Dace, what, what is it, what? - Cramps! Ow! Oh. (Dace shrieking) - [Jess] What, what is it, what? - Uh, is that one of Dace's new conquests? - Funny, I thought he was gay. - Sometimes I get 'em so bad, I just have to go right to bed. - Maybe I should get Thera, huh? - No! No, what could she do? I mean, we're just gonna have to sit 'em out. Ow, ow! - [Thera] I'll fly up tomorrow. - No, they're expecting us tonight. - [Thera] I'll join you, darlin'. - That isn't the way I had it planned. - Well, and I didn't plan it at all. Darling, I'll walk you to the limo. You're so considerate and wonderful and I appreciate it, all right? - Oh, yes, I think they're going away. Yes, aah. - Okay, I'm gonna get you some water, okay? - Wait! - What? - Ow! They're coming back again. Ow! - It must be tough being a woman. - Well, it has its moments. - Oh. (splashing) - All right, I'll wait for my CODiE but I want my Oscar now. - [Thera] I can't handle this, I really can't. I cannot handle this. All right, I'm gonna tell 'em both. - Thera, be sensible. There are women in this world, myself included, who can't find one heterosexual male to marry. You have two. You have it all. - No, I haven't. I mean, I'm only half myself with each of 'em. On top of that, I've probably committed some terrible felony. I couldn't be arrested for this, could I? I could? (Thera whimpers) I better do something right away. - [Dace] Well, which one could you possibly give up? - I don't know, which one do you have your eyes on? - Thera. - Oh, that was crummy, I'm sorry. At Thanksgiving I always say crummy things. Okay. It's the holidays and I'm spending it with both of them. I'll tell 'em both. - Hi. - Honey, what time is it? - It's at least two minutes since the last time you asked, my dear. - Oh, well, it is Thanksgiving. I mean, if the pilgrims had missed the plane to Plymouth, we wouldn't be here celebrating, it, would we? - I would, with you. Now come here. How's he look? - Oh, he's heavenly. Honey, where's the family? - They said they might be late. - Oh really, how late? - Would you have a glass of wine and relax please? - Okay. (timer dings) (gasps) Oh, Jess, we have to talk. - You wanna talk turkey? - Yes, I mean, no, Jess-- - Honey, what do I do with this thing? - Cover it with foil. - What? On the table? - I have to talk to you, yes. Jess, please, I want you to sit. All right, look, you cover it, you cover the bird with foil until the juices settle, okay? Jess, now can we talk? - Now. Let the bird sit until it reaches the texture of vinyl. - (laughing) Honey, forget about that, okay? I can't wait. I have to talk to you right now. - What? - What? I'm gonna tell you what. - Oh, how do you expect my juices to settle when you're looking at me like that? - Honey, please don't. - The pilgrims did. - I know, but that was New England and they were cold. Jess, before I started to date you, before you and I got married, I was involved-- (doorbell rings) - They're here. - Jess, I have to talk to you now. - We'll talk later. - I can't! I have to go to Santa Fe later, Jess. - Oh, I forgot, the designers thing. You'll eat and run and we'll talk on Sunday. - [Thera] Jess, please (doorbell rings) - Coming! Honey, do you realize that in the best marriages there's very little talk? - How come? - Because there's so much understanding. - But Jess, you don't understand. - [Woman] Happy Thanksgiving! - [Thera] Oh, hi! - She looks older. (Thera laughs) (Thera crunching) - God is good, God is great. Let, um, no, I mean, God is good, good God. No, I mean, God is good, God is great, let us, let, God is good. Let me start over. God. - Come on, Kimmy, I can say it. - No, I'm going to. Good is God-- - God is great, God is good, let us thank him for our food. Amen! - Amen. - Amen. - Amen. - Amen. (lively instrumental music) (guests chattering indistinctly) - There she is, there's Thera. To my wonderful workaholic wife, Thera. - To Thera. - Thank you. Thank you very much. I'm really sorry that I'm late, sorry. - You must be starved. - Famished. - Oh, you know Jean Vorivan, the wine critic. - Oh, yes. - Nice to see you. - How nice to see you. Please sit down. - Thank you. - Peter. - Yes. - Right after this evening is over, I have to talk to you. It's really important. I have to talk to you. - Of course, darling, of course. Among other things, hm? - Yes. - As an excellent companion to this beautiful terrine, this Chablis is the product of a large harvest grown in near-perfect conditions. To the vineyard. - To the vineyard. - Ahh. - Ooh, that was very nice, darling. - Unlike the Beaujolais of '80 or '81, this fresh new Beaujolais just bottled is already in its prime. And so may I ask you to join with me in celebrating its youth and vigor. - Its youth and its vigor. - In a toast to our host here at Fiorno, - In a toast to our host. - Senor Fiorno. - Senor Fiorno. - Senor Fiorno. - Peter, I have to talk to you. I really have to talk to you. You're not talking to me. - All right, darling. Shh, shh, people, people. (guests chattering indistinctly) The most eminent and respected Chateau d'Yquem, queen of the whites. ♪ Queen of the whites ♪ - Sweetheart. (Thera laughing) Darling. Darling! - What do you mean, queen of the whites? I don't understand that drink. (laughing) - Sweetheart. (cork popping) Ahh. And now a very special toast to a very special year. Darling, give me your hand, hm? Darling. (laughing) To 1961, the year of this golden effervescence, the year we met. And to this year, the year that we met again. Is something wrong? - No! It's the wine. - Don't you like it? - I like it, it's juicy, it's very juicy. - Too complex, do you think? - It's psychotic. - I find it rather insouciant. - What's the matter with your hand? - Nothing! (grunting) - Are you sure you're okay? - Yes, I'm fine. - Aggressive for a champagne. - Want some-- - I don't want anything. - Honey, are you okay? What's the matter? I don't understand. Honey, are you sure? - I'm positive, it's-- - At the finale to this perfectly marvelous feast I would like to offer my thanks to Peter Baylin, my close friend and revered connoisseur, (snaps) in the form of a gift from my private reserve. Its value cannot be estimated anymore, just as there can be no value placed on true friendship. Peter, please accept this 1891 bottle of Napoloeon Cognac as a token of my esteem and affection. (Thera grunts) (bottle shattering) (guests gasping) (thunder rumbling) (Thera screaming) - Fraud! - Peter? - If there's one thing I will not stand for, it is fraud. - Ooh, I knew you'd find out sooner or later. - 500 cases of what was supposed to be premium French Bordeaux, and every bottle with my label on it. - You're talking about wine? - Can you imagine trying to pull a fast one like that on me? I mean, who do they think they're dealing with? I've gotta go to Paris, that's all. - Right now? - Well honey, what can I do? I am responsible. - Oh Peter, Peter, Peter, I... There's something that I shoulda told you a long time ago, Peter. There's something that I've kept from you. - Well, as long as we're confessing, there's something that I've kept from you, too. - Really? - Mm-hm. - What? - I'll tell you after you tell me. - No, go on. - No, you first. - Really, go ahead. - No, go ahead. - Go ahead. - No, you go ahead. - Go ahead. - Are you sure? - Sure. - Okay. Well, I didn't wanna add an extra burden to your life, but-- - Well, what? - Look, I've had some tests. Now they're not definitive-- - Peter, a heart attack? - Not yet. - Oh, Peter! - No, it's okay. Look, the doctor says that this problem can be controlled with proper diet and exercise. But most of all, love. - Love. - Now your turn. - I don't remember. - You don't remember? - No, it was in the dream, and you know how dreams are. You wake up and they're all gone. - Excuse me, sir. Terrific. Thank you! (woman on intercom chattering) Hi. 72nd and Park. - Yeah, okay. (man chattering on intercom) What you got there? - It's for my wife, I'm gonna surprise her. - It's gonna cost you extra. - What? - $1.50 for a work of art. - [Jess] Whoa. Here you go, man. - Thanks a lot. - I don't like you carrying all this by yourself. Don't you think we should get Benny the door man to help? - Yeah, get him to help us. Yeah, right, right. No, I'm in a hurry. Will you please-- - Why are you in such a hurry? Just relax, we're on our way to the airport. I mean, you're just gonna catch a plane. (door banging shut) I don't know why you feel we have to rush-- - Honey, we've gotta get there. There's only one international flight a day, you know that. - But you don't have to rush. We have plenty of time, sweetheart. - Darling, we don't have that much time, believe me. - We have all the time in the world. - We don't have that much time. - Just lay back and relax. - Thera! - I know we don't, so I gotta get the flight. - Darling, darling, you're right. We'd better hurry. Driver, could you step on it please? Step on it, go, go! - Hey, that's my wife! (whistling) (car honking) (tires screeching) Follow that cab. (energetic music) - That's right, darling. What those wine importers tried to do to you, I think fraud is awful. Driver, could you step on it, please? - Can't you get this thing to go any faster, bud? - [Driver] You want faster, you got it. - You never know about people. Take my last fare. A young, good lookin' guy. Got this big painting, said he made it for his wife, see. So we get where he wants to go, he gets out, and you get in. And he sees you and he comes runnin'-- - You know, I get real nervous when people drive and talk. Could you just step on it please? (tires squealing) - Whoa! (laughs) - Driver, could you step on it? We're in a hurry! - I'm goin' as fast as I can, lady. - Thera, would you tell him to slow down? - Oh darling, I can't, I've gotta be at the dentist in 20 minutes. - The dent, you went to the dentist yesterday! - Oh, did I say dentist? I meant therapist. - Since when are you seeing a therapist? - No, no, no, no, I mean my dentist is like a therapist, darling. It feels so good to have clean teeth. Driver, could you step on it just a little bit, please? Oh, that's perfect. (tires squealing) Oh, that's nice! Oh, darling, don't you love being driven? - Yeah, but not to my funeral. Wow, Thera, this is ridiculous. (horn honking) (tires screeching) - Ooh, that was terrific, driver! Oh, now you have time for a nice, leisurely walk to the gate, darling. - Thera! - What, darling? - We have time for a goodbye kiss, don't we? - Yes, darling. - Okay. - Mm! (tires screeching) Darling, not that much time. You gotta go, you gotta go, darling. - Oh, the show, damn it! - What, what? - I'm gonna miss the preview of your new fall line. - Oh darling, don't worry. There's gonna be so many shows, darling. You go give 'em hell for me in Paris, darling. Vive la France! Ciao, ciao, baby. Bye, baby. - Oh, Thera? (man on intercom chattering indistinctly) - Thera! - Sweetheart! Darling, what are you doing here? - I've been chasing you all over town. I guess you were in some kinda rush to see him off. - Him? - Your accountant. - My account, my accountant, yes! Oh sweetheart. I'm so glad to see you. I'm so glad you're here. - Okay, okay, all right. Here I am, it's your chance to show me New York. - Oh darling, I can't. No, I'm on my way to LA right now. - Thera, this is crazy. We've been married four months now and I've never seen your apartment once. Now you wanna go all the way back to LA? - Lady, I only go as far as Queens. (lively instrumental music) - Okay, I'll tell her. Okay, bye bye. Baby? - Hm? - [Jess] That was Dace on the phone. She's got a question about yardages. - Oh, okay, I'll call her back when I get out, if I ever get out. - Okay. I'm gonna go in and work, okay? - Okay. Peter, would you get me a drink? Aya, God damn! - What did you call me? - Ooh, I just asked you to get me a drink. - Yeah, you called me Peter. - Ooh honey, I guess it's jet lag. I'm sorry. What kept you so long on the phone? - Dace and I were talking about her wanting credit, you know, for her designs. - Don't you think that's between me and Dace? - [Jess] I don't know, I mean, putting myself in her place-- - You really seem to like to do a lot lately. - What? Ooh, I don't believe it. You're jealous? - You're darn right. Dace is your age. I mean, she's very attractive. You like that type, and you do have a whole past together. - We went to the same art school. That's hardly a whole past. - Well, it's more of a past than we have. - We have a marriage. - Whatever that means. - Whatever that means. Oh. Okay. To me, marriage is everything, honesty, loyalty, and absolute trust. Now look, just because you're on your own half the time, it doesn't mean I walk around with my head full of fears that you're out fooling around. - Why don't you? - Because you love me, and you're my wife. And I trust you. - Can a person drown in two feet of water? (phone ringing) - I'll bring it with me, and we'll see you day after tomorrow. Oh, I just spoke to New York. The show arrangements are finalized. - Oh good! Okay, I'll book us back to New York tonight. - Oh, I wanted to go back tomorrow. I have some Thera Sport designs in the works and I wanted to stay and see 'em mocked up. - No way, Dace, I need your help in New York. - All right. Thera, I want credit if you use my designs in the fall line. - Dace, we have had this conversation before. And now, evidently, you've had it with Jess. So I would say this conversation has been had. - But not settled. - (sighs) All right. I don't pay you to pursue your own interests on my time, okay? And I don't pay you to pursue my interests anytime. - What is that supposed to mean? - I don't suppose it's crossed your mind that Jess might be a free agent any time now. - Oh, oh, oh, oh. Why don't we just have this discussion after the show? I think you're under too much pressure. - No, I wanna have it right now. Right now. I think it's a long time overdue. - All right. I made a fool of myself with Peter. I apologized for that before. I'll apologize again. I am sorry. But I have nothing else to apologize to you for. Maybe your generation's just too jaded to understand friendship between the sexes. - That depends on your definition of friendship. - Or maybe it's your guilty conscience. - Traitor. - Oh, I don't deserve that at all. And if that's the kinda thanks I get for knocking myself out to manage your business, to say nothing of your crazy love life, then maybe I don't need to be here. - Maybe you don't. - I'm ready to go out on my own. - Are you? Well, I'm gonna make it real easy for you, Dace. You're fired! - Fine! I'm just sorry I'm not gonna be around to see your show. I'd love to see how you're gonna manage any of that without me, any of it. - Why are you watching me? Get back to work. You too. (upbeat music) (crowd applauding) (crowd applauding) (cameras clicking) - [Announcer] Ladies and gentlemen, your host for this evening and the creator of these fabulous designs, Thera. (crowd applauding) (cameras clicking) - Thanks very much, thank you. Thanks all of you, very much. I appreciate it. Thank you very much. I'd like to invite you to be my guests for cocktails, but first I really have to thank some people whose dedicated efforts made this a wonderful evening. I'd like to thank Jon Benson. (crowd applauding) Sweetheart, hi! (laughing) And Eleanor Armad. Eleanor, thank you. (crowd applauding) And Rosemary. And, um, Rosemary, you know who you are. Rosemary, ooh, Rosemary I know your last name. Rosemary, Rosemary, thank you very much, Rosemary, and everyone, thank you, and now we'll all have a drink. (crowd applauding) (cheering) - Bravo! (easygoing music) (crowd chattering) - Thera, can I tell you, that was the pinnacle. Absolutely the most fantastic-- - Of course you can, Karen. Thank you, dear. - Can I tell you how they confront rather than conflict? - You already have, Karen, thanks. - How they inspire rather than compete. - Yes, what they really do is they collude rather than collide. Thanks, Karen, thanks. - Baby, ooh! Oh, I am so proud of you. - Jess, let's go. - Go, what for? - I don't like these after show parties. - But this is your after show party. Look, you need a drink. - I don't want a drink. - You need one. - Jess, please! Let's just get out of here. - [Peter] Thera! - Right after I've had a drink. (laughing) - (laughs) That's my girl. - Okay. - Oh, I'm sorry. We seem to be blazing the same trail. - [Thera] Ooh! - Mrs. Baylin, you've done it again. - Again? I mean, yes. Oh Peter, I'm so surprised you're here, Peter. - I flew all night. I wouldn't have missed this for the world. - Oh, darling, you must be exhausted. Go right home, get some rest, I'll meet you there, okay? - No, no, I slept on the plane. Let me get you a drink. - I don't want a drink. - Whiskey-- - I don't want a drink! I don't want, I don't need a drink. - Thera, don't you suppose that after all these years I know what you need? - [Thera] I don't, I don't need a drink! - I'll be right back. - Thera, darling, it was absolutely marvelous. - Excuse me, could I get a whiskey, light ice, short straw, please? - Mother. - Darling, I am absolutely mad about that-- - Mother. - Beaded jacket. - Mother! - How much is it for me? - Mother! - Thera, you're not listening. (Thera whimpering) - Whiskey, light ice, short straw please. - (laughs) You know, that is the first time I have heard anybody else order that. That's my wife's drink. - Oh, mine too. Hey, hey wait a second, aren't you the fellow that I saw, well, I thought that Dace said you were, uh, single. - I don't think we've actually ever met. - Oh, Peter Baylin. - Jess. What? You're Peter? - Mm-hm. - I wouldn't have expected to see you here. - Thera, will you listen to me? Please, Thera, this is very important. - Well, I try not to miss a show. - Is your wife here? - Well, of course. Thera! - No, no, no, I mean your new wife. - What new wife? - The one you married after you got the divorce in the Dominican Republic. - Well, who told you about the Dominican Republic? - Thera. Here, honey, here's your drink. - Ooh, thank you very much. - Hold on just a minute, hold on just one minute. Why would you tell a perfect stranger something about Dominican Republic-- - Perfect stranger? - He's not, Jess isn't a perfect stranger, darling. He created our Thera Sport logo. We worked very closely together, artist-- - Yeah, among other things. Well wait, why did Dace tell me you were Thera's accountant, huh? - Oh, because of the way he handles our business. Yeah, he practically is. I mean, the amount of money he saved me is just incredible. He's great with money. - I didn't realize you were so close with your ex-husband. - Ex? Present husband! Present and accounted for. - You are Peter Baylin, right? - Yeah, well I'm beginning to wonder. I'm also beginning to wonder who the hell you think you are. - Hey, pal-- - Hold it! Peter, this is my husband, Jess. Jess, this is my husband, Peter. (glasses clinking) Please let me talk to you! Peter! Jess! Please, just let me talk to you, please, Jess. - Yeah, you talk to me long distance, Thera. - Please! - Get away from me! - Jess, I just have to talk. If you'd just let me explain. - Let's go. - Peter, please! Jess, Peter! Ooh. - Oh my God. - Will you just let me talk? I can close the door myself. Peter, please! You had affairs, and I listened! - [Peter] Affairs are one thing, but marriage? - Peter! Jess! Taxi. (gentle instrumental music) - [Stanley] From Times Square, this is Stanley Nevin. We're only moments away from the new year. ("Auld Lang Syne" instrumental) - Oh, I have something for you, Sabe. I brought it from the office party. I knew the color would suit you. It's perfect. Don't get up, I'll fix us both a drink. (glasses clinking) Happy New Year, Sabe. (doorbell ringing) Hello? - Happy New Year! - Mother? - No, it's Guy Lombardo in support hose. - [Thera] Oh! - Couldn't get a cab to take me down to Times Square. So I thought we'd celebrate here and make us a little party. Champagne, pate, party hats. (laughs) And, of course, (bell ringing) (horn blowing) noisemakers. - That's sweet, Mother, really. Thank you, I just, I don't feel like a party. - What do you wanna do? - I don't know. I wish I did. - Oh. Peter and Judd. - Jess, Mother. - Jess. Have you heard from them? - No. Jess won't answer my calls and Peter had his number changed. - Well, I must admit, I was completely taken by surprise. Two husbands at once. Thera, I never thought you had it in you. - Yeah, well I shoulda kept it in me. I mean, I never expected this, you know? I never expected to end up-- - Alone and lonely? (laughs) Isn't that what you meant? - No, I didn't say that, Mother. - I did, so you needn't feel guilty. Thera, I'm alone but I'm not lonely. There's a big difference, you know. - No, I don't know, Mother. I really don't know. I mean, you always look happy. You always seem to be having a wonderful time. Mother, what happens when you go home at night and you look at the four walls? - I've been alone for X number of years. I was always like this. You didn't know me before you were born. Ask anyone, if there's anyone still around who remembers me then. There was only one time I wasn't like this, when I was married to your father. It wasn't his fault. Marriage, it made me somebody else. - Is that why you never got remarried? - You think I never had any offers? No, I don't want to be married. I was never afraid to be alone. It was you, Thera, always you. - Always? - Don't you remember, even before your father left you always had to have a nightlight on, and we always had to line up all your stuffed toys in bed beside you for company. - (sighs) Well, not much has changed, has it? - Thera. Thera, you were company enough for two dynamite men. You're a fantastic lady. Why can't you believe that you can be company enough for yourself? - It's different. - No, it isn't. - Mother. - What? - I don't wanna be alone. - How do you know that yet? Come on. Let's pop the champagne. (doorbell ringing) - [Thera] Yeah, coming. Hello. - Mrs. Baylin? - Right. - [Thera] Thank you. - [Marney] What is it, Thera? - (sighs) My just desserts. - Oh good, I forgot to bring dessert. (laughing) (doorbell ringing) - Mrs. Enright? - Right again. Right. Oh, Mrs. Montrose! You want a divorce? I have an extra. (door bangs) (soft instrumental music) - Thera? (Thera gasps) I saw the lights on and I still had my key, so I thought I'd just... I heard about what happened. I didn't have anything to do with it, you know, their both showing up. - I know that, I know. How you doin', Dace? - Well, it's not easy out there. - Ooh, isn't that the truth. Well, if I was a backer I'd take a chance on you. - I didn't come here for that. - How'd you like to live in California? I'm looking for someone to run Thera Sport. - Nah, I think I'd rather stay in New York. Anyway, I've got a job at Alocasia. How are you? - I'm okay. I mean, I stopped living on frozen dinners. Do you know that last night I actually made myself a real meal? I couldn't believe it. I mean, I put fresh flowers on the table and I lit a candle, just for me. - It's not so bad being on your own. So how's your work? - It's wonderful. It's really wonderful. I mean, I'm back to designing full time. It's taking a new direction. I don't know exactly where it's going, but it's like I'm just following my pencil around the paper, you know? All in all, really, I'd say I'm better. - All in all, I'd say you're the best. Look, I'm on my way to a valentine's party. I would love it if you came along with me. - Ooh, I'm glad you asked me. It means a lot to me. But I'm into this, I'm on a roll now. I think I'd like to stay with this. But give my love to Lloyd. - Who's Lloyd? (both laughing) - Who's Lloyd. How quickly we forget. (knocking) Did you close the door when you came in? - No. - Hello? Hello. - Thera O'Mara? - Yes. Thank you very much. Ooh. Be my valentine. It's not signed. - [Dace] Peter? - Ooh, I don't think so. Peter's been in Europe for weeks. - Jess then? - No, Jess would never send a store-bought valentine. - Well then, it's whoever you want it to be. (gentle instrumental music) (birds cawing) (knocking) - Hi. - Hi. - I signed the final papers. - I'm sorry, Thera. - Oh Jess, I'm sorry. Really, I'm just so sorry. - I guess I had some growing up to do. - I hope I haven't made a cynic out of you. - No, just a realist. And that's not bad, because fantasies don't travel well. - [Andrea] Jess? - Andrea, this is Thera. - Thera. Hi. - Hi. - I have to go back to the office. I really have to go now. - I'll walk you to the car. - It wasn't by any chance you who sent me the rose on Valentine's Day, was it? - Do you wish it was? - Yes. And no. - You still be coming to the coast? - (laughs) Well, maybe a little less often. Will you be here? - I'll be here. - Take care. (gentle instrumental music) - You too. (children chattering and laughing) - Hi. I didn't know if you'd come. - And pass up the chance to cast eyes on the world's only female bigamist? - Well, only known female bigamist. How are you, Peter? - I'm all right. You? - Older and wiser, don't I look it? - You look irritatingly wonderful. Why did you ask me to meet you here? - Oh, just to talk. - I don't wanna talk! - Peter, your heart. - My heart's fine. It was a false alarm. I've got high blood pressure and you're not helping me bring it down. Thera, what the hell were you trying to prove? I mean, why couldn't you just have an affair? - I'm not that kind of girl, Peter. I'm not built like that. I'm just not that kinda girl. - Then what kinda girl are you, Thera? - The kind, I don't know, the kind that I just felt I could never be with you. You would just never let me be the kinda girl I am, Peter. You'd never let me be free. - Obviously you didn't need my permission. - I don't mean that kinda free, Peter. I don't mean free to cheat. I mean free to be me, me, who I am, all of me, with you, Peter. I don't know. I mean, I could never be who I am with you, free to just push us both in a pond if I felt like it, something, anything, I don't know. I mean, Peter, we're so proper with each other. We never play anymore. - Is that my fault? I mean, how do you play with a damn fashion plate all the time? You can't even mess up your hair. - Oh, that's another thing. I mean, I could never even wear my hair the way I wanted to. There's a real good example. I mean, I like my hair like this, Peter. - So do I. - I get up in the morning sometimes, I don't feel like taking pins and fixing it up and looking... You do? - Uh-huh. - Really? - See that? Now how come we have never yelled at each other like that before? - I don't know. I like to yell. (screaming) - All the times that I wanted to be crazy with you, that I wanted to sweep you off your feet. I wanted to astonish you with love and surprises. - Peter, what stopped you? - I mean, I was afraid, I guess, that you'd laugh at me. I mean, you know me, Thera. You've seen me floss my teeth and clip my toenails. - Oh Peter, I love your toenails. Oh Peter, what is it? I mean, really, what is it, Peter? Is it me? Is it marriage? - Look, you're the expert. - (laughs) Me? The night you came home, Peter, and you told me that you were in love with someone else, oh Peter, I got so scared. I still love you, Peter. And that really scares me. - Honey, I'm sorry. I mean, I'm truly sorry. All I know is I just wanna take you home with me, and I wanna hold you in my arms. - And then what, Peter? I mean, really. Do we just go on with our lives as if this never happened? I mean, how do I know that I can ever trust you again? - Wait a second. How do I know I can ever trust you? Hm? How about dinner? - I'm starving. - So am I. - Dinner, Peter. - Come on. - So I was standing and I was talking... (Thera gasps) (splashing) (Thera screams) (Peter laughing) - Come over here! - Oh my God! What did, what did... - Never play, huh? I never play, huh? - You never play-- - Get over here.
