[all laughing] We should all hang out at some point, but for now, just-- Why don't you warm up at the bar? We've got a great happy hour menu going with some good starters, I think you're really going to like. -Okay, man, thank you. -[host] Hey, hey. -Thank you. -[host] Hey, just, you know. -First round's on me. -Thank you, man. -[host] Yeah? -That's nice, thank you [host] Have a seat. Allison, can you take care of this for me? -Yeah. -Just put the napkins on the chairs. I don't want them to mess up the furniture. [Allison] Okay. Hold on. -[Nijm] Huh? -[Allison] Here you go. Oh, thank you. That's so nice. -So, you can dry yourself off. -[Nijm] Thank you. -You're welcome. -[Nijm] Oh, hey. Any idea of how long it may take for a table? He cannot-- [Nijm] Huh? He can't? He cannot what? He can't guarantee anything. Why don't you two have a drink? What does she mean, "He can't guarantee anything?" It's probably because we didn't have a reservation. -Ah, yes, we had. I made one. -[Irina] No, you didn't. I made one this morning. You don't do anything you say you're gonna do. I'm sick of having just enough. Just enough, I have always had just enough. Just enough in the bank to pay the rent, just enough in the tank to get to work, just enough love for the night. For once, I want that steak on the table. Can't get a steak at the bar, though. We'll get crab. [Nijm] You can't get crab either. You can get steak medallions or crab cake. But you can't get crab. Or a steak. Not at the bar. [Irina] Maybe it's a good thing. I don't think it's a good thing. Good evening. Can I get you two something to drink? Yeah, champagne. [waiter] We only serve champagne by the bottle. -Is that all right? -That's a good thing. We only drink champagne from the bottle. [waiter] Sounds like a good match. -[Naijm] Ah, excuse me. -[waiter] Yeah? A couple of Seven and Sevens. I'm sorry, sir, unfortunately, I can only serve you one drink at a time. I can put the order in, bring the Seven and Sevens out, do the champagne after you're done with that first round. Does that work? [Irina] Can I have the champagne first? -I've been waiting all day. -[waiter] Champagne it is. [waiter] Wonderful. Half of my life is over, and I'm still here at the bar. Waiting. No reservation. And I've called. I've called so many times. And still no table for me. [Irina sighs] [Nijm] I've put in the work all my fucking life. I just wanted this fucking steak. Your attitude sometimes... I swear. You think the world owes you something? [Nijm] Oh, the world does owe me something at this point in my life. I deserve a piece of the pie, I deserve a seat at the table. [Irina] You know, people work their whole life to get something. And it's not about the "thing," it's about the journey and the experience. [Nijm] I put in the work. [Irina] And you should keep putting in the work. It's about being a good person. Oh, fuck you. Go and be a good person. See how far it gets you in this world. We're so different. -We're so different. -You fucking ideal prick. [Irina] What is wrong with you? Why are you so rude? Huh? What have you done today? What have you done today? How many beers do you think you've drank today, huh? An ocean. I drank an ocean of beers, and I'm still not drunk. Do you know what you are? [Nijm] What does that make you? [sighs] ♪ You'd make a horrible father. Horrible father. ♪ I cannot believe I thought of you in that sense. You are incapable of loving anybody. Anybody but yourself. To think that I was happy at the thought of carrying your child. [waiter] Champagne. [Irina] Oh, fuck. [sighs] [sighs] ♪ [sobbing] Thank God, all I do is miscarry with you. Thank God.
