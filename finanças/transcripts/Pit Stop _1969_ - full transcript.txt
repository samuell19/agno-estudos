- Hi, Mr Willard. - Hi. - What's the bet? - That's where we've got a problem. This boy don't wanna put up no money. Says he wants to go for the cars, his Chevy against yours. Ace thinks he can take him but he don't wanna go unless you say so on account of you own the car. - What's he got in it? - I don't know. He won't raise the hood or say nothing. Man, a lot of money changing hands on this 'un. I say go ahead. Hello, Rick. - Do I know you? - I'm Grant Willard. I put up your bond, Rick. Oh, yeah? What did you do that for? Oh, I felt kinda responsible for you. You know, that Chevy that you dragged the other night, I owned that. - I had that Chevy beat by a mile. - Not from where I sat. I guess we'll never know. So, we both lost. Come on, I'll buy you a cup of coffee. - Hey, wait a minute. - What's the matter with you? I just sprung you from this joint. You wanna go back in? Could I have another receipt, please? Rick, here's my card. You see, I fool around with all kinds of racing. I even sponsor fellas that can drive really fast. Are you interested? Figure of eight? - You mean it's got an intersection? - That's right. You'd have to be crazy to drive in a race like that. On the first lap of figure eight racing, it's Bolsen, Curtis, Turner, Kimble, Jones, McCoy, Johnson and Jacowski into the turn and there'll be two or three cars coming through the intersection, the stragglers. Now! Hey, look out! Look out! They're packed in, a big crowd at Ascot Park watching figure eight racing. Timber! Jacowski and Turner are hurt badly. Look out! Look out! Bolsen, Turner, Kimble, Jones, they're fighting badly! ...that's a bad spot, don't park there! They've got a fire...' They're fighting, they're battling. It's hub to hub and wheel to wheel. Kimble and Jones in competition now. Crager having a lot of trouble. - 'That was a bad one!' - How do you like it? Oh, man, this is the nuttiest thing I've ever seen. It isn't racing, it's... The red flag for the doctor. The ambulance is coming. They'll only hold up the race long enough to help the boy. Let's see how bad it is. - You think you'd like to try it? - No chance! I think I'd rather go back to the joint. The boy is into the infield. And the race is on, they're running again. Hawk Sidney is charging on the last lap! The 58 car wins it, Hawk Sidney! The Hawk has won another. He's cunning, he's clever. Here he comes with the chequered flag. He's the bad boy of racing! We must give him a hand, folks! A lot of booing for The Hawk. They don't like the way he wins some of these races. Ahhh to you! Yeah! Yeah! Who's that character? That's Hawk Sidney. He's the one that usually wins. That's one of my cars he's driving. - 'The trophy girl...' - Oh, yeah! Yeah? Somebody booed him and he kissed her again for good measure. He gets as much of a kick out of the boos as he does the cheers. Figure eight racing, every Sunday night at Ascot Park, and the Hawk is challenging the new drivers every week. The young boys have to beat up with him and go on. Call this racing? Come on, I'll buy you a beer. There'll be dancing till two o'clock in the morning at the 190 Club. Hey! If it ain't the custom car king himself! Really straightened them out, didn't we? All that purse money and not even a scratch on that famous plum-purple, pearl-plate paint job. It's called pearl plum and it takes 14 coats! Yeah, that's right. Hell, I ought to know, I spray that stuff on all day long. Say, Hawk, I think I've got a real challenger here for you, if we can persuade him to come into the game. Yeah? This little guy here? Hey, boy, you gonna race with us? I don't know if I got the guts. What you mean is, you don't think you're dingy enough. Cos everybody knows you gotta be dingy to run figure eight. Especially Mr Willard here. Is that right, Grant? - Bob, bring The Hawk a beer. - Hey, yeah! Now, listen here, boy. You know why I'm the winner? Cos I'm dingy as there is! So when they see me coming through that intersection, they naturally back off, cos they know I ain't gonna stop for nobody. So when you see me coming, you best get out of the way, cos I'm the dingiest there is! Right? Right! That's why I drive a California Custom for Grant Willard. I'm a businessman, Hawk. I need a winner. You got one! Yeah! Come here to me! What do you think, Rick? He's the one to beat. Where can I get me a car? She's been raced a couple of times, but never seemed to run too good. I'll take care of that. What do you want for it? If I was just to sell her flat out, I guess a couple of hundred dollars. But the usual thing is, if I sponsor a fella, you just drive, and if you win, we split the purse. I don't wanna be tied down to anybody. Look, I'll make you a deal. I'll fix up the engine so it runs really good. You let me race it and I'll pay you full price out of the prize money. My money. Say, erm, did that Grant Willard send you over here? Yeah, that's right. What of it? Oh, it's an old story. He's always coming up with young fellas like you, usually been in lots of trouble, coming around here figuring it's a way to make easy money. Well, they drive the races for a while, then they get busted up a bit and I don't know where they go. But the easy money goes to Grant Willard, cos he owns a big piece of that racetrack. Look, son, you wanna make some honest money? If you can handle a torch, I'll put you on here for two and a quarter an hour. Hey. Who said I needed a job? Now, look, I'm offering you two bills for a car that ain't even worth 50 and you know it. Now, are you interested or not? What if you smash her up? Then I'll go to work for you at two bucks an hour till I pay it off. Now, what do you say? Fair enough. You've got a deal. Help yourself to anything around here and if you need any help... Forget it. I don't want any help. Another big crowd here for figure eight racing and the cars are starting out. Rick Bowman in the white 194 car from Palmdale, California. This driver's switching from drag racing to figure eight racing. The green flag. 28 cars and they've got a long way to go. A lot of cars, a lot of action. Crash. Bowman in the white 194 car. He's made it! That is very cruel! Look out, look out, look out. Up and over the edge. The cars are getting through and Jacowski turns... ..a long way to go. A big crowd here tonight. Rick Bowman coming... The red flag is coming out. The doctor, the ambulance are coming over. Bowman may be hurt. In the other car, Zuniggi of Pico Rivera, California. Bowman appears to be... No, he's all right. He's getting out. They'll take him to the ambulance now. That's part of the official rules. Bowman has pulled his helmet off! He's all shook up! He's fighting Zuniggi! Bowman punches Zuniggi! The officials are there. This boy's a scrabbler. Bowman may not get through the intersection, but the boy's a fighter. They've got to get him in the ambulance... He's a little shook up. Bowman has to go in the ambulance. It's the rules. Grant, where do you manage to find these guys? There's a suicide born every minute. They're clearing the track now and getting set to go. 20 cars still remain in action. The race will continue on. Figure eight racing at Ascot Park every Sunday night. Well, if it ain't the king of the dirt track hisself! - Hi, Jolene. - Hi! Well, what can we do for you, sport? Well, boys, I'm going into big time. Gonna fix me up a car to run the Phoenix International for Grant Willard. Gonna drive a back-up car for Ed McCleod. Sort of run interference for him. Well, with you banging around, Ed McCleod's probably the only one who'll finish! Which hot dog is gonna pull something out for me? - The boys are having their lunch. - Yeah, Hawk, union rules! - No working during lunch break. - That's right. We're organised. I ain't never seen such a total disorganised group in my life! Go on, sport, pick out what you need. Take your time. I'll keep your girlfriend warm for you. Come on, Jolene, give Uncle Luther a kiss. I'll give you a kick in the radiator, you old lecher! Did you listen to that what she said? Don't you snip at me. I took you across my knee when you was little - and I ain't beyond doing it yet. - Yeah, you better look out, girl. That horny toad would love to lay a hand on your backside! Especially now it's all grown up into that nice cupcake shape! You guys are terrible! Come by the stand tomorrow, I'll make sure you get a fly in your coffee. What you doing, boy? Fixing the brakes? Never use them myself. Took 'em off my own car, throwed 'em away. You got her fixed up pretty good. Running her in the figure eights? - That's right. - Well, I've got a good piece of advice. Stay out of my way, you'll be all right. Hey, look, you're bothering me. - Now, is there something you want? - Ooh. You getting mighty touchy. Why, you're scaring me! Oh, look out, he's gonna hit me! Oh! Oh, please, don't hit me, please! Please, God, have mercy! Hi. Re-sent. You're the guy that started the fight the other night, aren't you? At the track. Why do you guys always wanna start a fight with each other, anyway? I don't know. It just happens sometimes. I mean, do you always know why you do something? No, I sure don't. Watch out, Hawk, Rick's taking your girl! Oh, Lord, have mercy! Are you his girl? No, I just grew up with all these guys around here. I'm nobody's girl. The figure eight cars here in action at Ascot Park. 20, 30 cars starting in one race. Hey, Harry, watch this. I promise you, this one will be a real crasher. Everybody is watching the 198 car, now at the intersection. It's Rick Bowman. He totalled the 194 car last week, he's in a black 198 this week. He's a young driver from Palmdale, California... It's Hawk Sidney moving forward. And he is seeming to already have gone on to be a crowd pleaser. Rick Bowman in the 198 car has got all of the veterans out there fearing him. And Hawk is moving through the pack! Bowman has got his work cut out, but he's doing a good job in the 198 car. Jones, McCoy, Johnson and Jacowski... Bowman's doing a good job, but The Hawk is coming through this time, through the crowd. The longest one of the races here at the track... He may smash him. Up and over is Bowman! He's smashed again! Last week, in the white 194 car, he was smashed. This week, it's the black 198 car. The doctor is going out there now. They had quite a scrap from this boy last time that he ran here. - This is his second race. - Hold it! Forget it! 'Oh, he's learned something.' I never saw Hawk Sidney play so rough before! What did you do, Grant? I told Hawk I'd give his car to Rick Bowman if Rick could beat him. The Hawk sure worked you over good that time, didn't he? The Hawk? What did he have to do with it? You'd better watch that fella. He's a sharpie. He had that thing set up like a chequerboard. Oh, I... I guess there's a lot I could learn about this racing game, eh, pop? Well, a few tricks and you should be able to take him. - You know those tricks, pop? - Well, I know a few of them. I used to drive an Indy-type car. I, er, ran it into the wall in 1929, that's how I got this leg. - Oh. That's too bad. - Well, you don't have to feel sorry. Most, or all, of them are dead that I raced with. On with the racing show. The 198 car being turned back. When I went into the turns, I was on the low side. Then I let the car drift towards the centre of the road so I could protect both the outside and the inside. If you want to pass the fella, you must first observe his pattern of driving. And if he goes into the turn on the low side, give your car a flat slide to the outside and cut in short and then you've got him. There's just one more thing. If you haven't learned how to play a harp, - stay away from that wall. - OK, pop. - Now let's try it again. - All right. OK. The cars are on the track for the semi main event. 15 laps to go with only four cars transferring to the main. Out on the turn, there's the green flag and we're underway! Ed McCleod driving for California Custom will be out to win this one. It's the only way he can make the main event. So he will have to do it the hard way. There's a spin on the first turn! Cars are spinning all over the racetrack. The 97 car, no place to go! The 67 car goes into the lead. Too late! Into the wall! Everybody wants to get into the main. This is one of the wildest semis we've seen in a long time! We have a crash on the south turn. Two more slam into the wall! You see that car 41 over there? That's the car to watch. That's Ed McCleod. Out of the turn, here they come! There's the chequered flag! And Ed McCleod hangs on for the win. Here he is, up to the line... That's the great man, eh? Yeah. He's running in the grand nationals for Grant Willard. That ought to give those chicken farmers a run for their money! Ain't exactly what you'd call a hard charger, is he? No, he's a pretty careful driver, but don't let that fool you. He's always in the money and he ain't crashed a car yet. There's your winner, Ed McCleod! That might be cos he ain't seen any real competition yet. You've got to beat Hawk Sidney first. A full house tonight and a brand new car on the track. A beauty. I don't know why it's here, but it's a California Custom special. We see Hawk Sidney is driving it. A gorgeous car. It's out at the starting line and The Hawk is getting out. We'll find out why it's here. Gee, this is a beauty. This is really a nice one. Intermission time is coming up now. Intermission. OK, fellas. I'm only gonna say this once, so you listen real good. I'm gonna run this baby in the internationals just like she's sitting right now. So, er... I guess I don't have to say what's gonna happen to anybody if they so much as ding the chrome a little. Hey, what's with The Hawk? Got himself a new car, all painted up fancy. Says he's gonna kill anybody who scratches her up. - Oh, yeah? - I'd like to see somebody flip that car. - Oh, yeah? Why don't you do it? - I don't wanna wind up in the hospital. Go on, you're not afraid of that big jerk! Well, I am. He carries an awful mean grudge. - Hey, Grant! - Hello, Rick. You gonna win tonight? You might be surprised. I got a proposition for you. If I can beat Hawk tonight, will you sponsor me at the Phoenix International? - Beat Hawk tonight? - Yeah. Look, one win don't make a champion, kid. What do you say, Grant? OK, with one reservation. Ed McCleod has got to approve. It's a deal. Thanks, Grant. You're an evil man, Grant Willard. Look, Harry, I'm trying to find myself a winner. Racing is a tough business. It's strictly the survival of the fittest. Just like war. You've got a winner and a loser and nothing in between. I busted a lot of heads training my company in the marines, but... when they got into action, they led the whole division in decorations received, what was left of them. Here we go, it's main event time here at Ascot Park and all eyes are on that brand new number 3 car with Hawk Sidney driving it. They're also watching the sensational new driver from Palmdale, California, Rick Bowman in the 198 car. The green flag and here they go at the main event! Hawk Sidney in a brand new car and out in front in the lead. Everybody's watching the California Custom special. A lot of cars, a lot of action. Up and over! Rick Bowman is moving up through the pack. The Hawk is in the lead. Cars are being spun out. They're having a tremendous battle. They're all trying to catch that brand new beautiful number 3 car. They're moving through. The Hawk is trying real hard in the new car. We see he's pushing and shoving. He's working his way through the pack. Two cars into the wall. Say, I think The Hawk is nervous in his new car now. Bowman seems to have got the feel of the drag here. He is beginning to shove them out of the way. Look out! Look out! Bowman is like a new driver. The third time out on the track, he's in the 198 car and he's doing a job of shoving them clear! Out in front is The Hawk in that new car. 40 cars out there in our main event. Bowman is moving through the pack, moving, moving, moving. But The Hawk hangs on to the lead. Jacowski, Turner and Jones are... He could do it in that new car. But Bowman's halfway through the pack already in the 198 car. Look out! A lot of cars, a lot of action. That new car has dropped back a way... Bowman is beginning to shove the cars out of the way... And the 3 car is dropping back. He's driving like he's possessed. The 198 car wants to win it! There is no-one else in there fighting for the lead. It looks like it's going to be The Hawk going all the way. Bowman just gets away. Bowman is moving up. The crowd is really wild here tonight. The Hawk has got his hands full! Bowman is gaining on him and gaining on him. He's routing him! Bowman is routing him! Bowman wins! The race is over. The Hawk ends up on his head and Bowman wins his third race here at the track. We don't know if The Hawk is injured or not. It didn't look like it but that new car is not new anymore. Here comes The Hawk out of it. This is a new experience for The Hawk. He's been busy wrecking cars for the other people. The main event is over. The Hawk is not laughing tonight. This concludes our racing from Ascot here this evening. There'll be racing here every Sunday night...' Too bad about your car, Hawk. Yeah, Hawk, tough luck. You look like you're sore. You're not sore at anyone, are you? I ain't sore. Should I be sore at somebody for something? Take that. Who you killing? Ed McCleod. Look out, McCleod, Rick Bowman is coming through! You know, you should keep your mind off cars once in a while. You know? You're right. I should. I, er... I live way up by Palmdale. - It's an awful long way from here. - Mm. Mm, that really is, isn't it? I've been sleeping at the yard till I get a place to stay around here. We could go to a motel. - Well, what do you say? - Hm? What? I said, we could go to a motel. Oh, that'd be fine. But let's stop and get some more booze first. OK? - OK? - OK. OK. I'd better call my dad so he doesn't wait up. OK? Left me alone And lonesome, too But I keep my foolish pride Hidden way down deep inside And I'll get along Without you Come on! Come on! Now that you're gone I won't be blue I'll just smile away the pain I'll get along Without you I'm over you and forgetting I'll go and find Someone new I have loved you from the start But you went and broke my heart And I'll get along Without you Now, listen, Rick, you were hurt last night. A lot worse than you think. You got yourself a nasty concussion and you're gonna be sick a good... - Hey, are you listening to me? - Yeah. Then listen good, Rick, because concussion is no joke. If you have nausea, dizziness, difficulty breathing, - call me right away, you hear me? - OK. And you go home right now, get to bed and stay there. You need bed rest and lots of it. You know, you race drivers are all dingy. You go out there and you get all busted up. You come in here, you won't take half that advice we give you. I've seen guys get hit real hard on the track and they need a doctor real bad because maybe they got a broken neck or something. But they think they feel OK, jump out of their car acting like a big hero and all that stuff, walk a few feet and fall over dead. If they'd had medical attention immediately, they'd have been all right. But they think they gotta act tough... - ...at 150 miles an hour plus. - Mm-hm. For more control, we use this spoiler area through here and this relieves the air pressure and accelerates the vehicle on the racetrack. Grant! Telephone! - What? - Telephone! - Oh. OK. Excuse me. - Sure thing, yeah. Hello? Oh, Rick! I thought you were coming by this morning. Oh, really? Well, that's too bad. But you've been doing real well on the track. I guess you deserve a little celebration. Yeah. I guess I did. Listen, Grant, what I wanted to ask you, where can I find Ed McCleod? Ansen. OK, Grant. Thanks a lot. I'll see ya. Hawk. - That was Rick Bowman. - Yeah? - What did he say? - He said he had a hangover. That's too bad. Huh? I thought you were mad at him. I got over it. You know, I'm sorry to hear that. He's racing in the modifieds tomorrow night. - Oh, yeah? - You'd better watch out for that boy. He's a goer. If he keeps winning races like that, I might consider him as a replacement for you in the international. All right, Mr Willard, if that's the way you want it. Oh, Hawk, I'm only kidding. You know I wouldn't do that. Oh. I see. - OK, Grant. - Do you feel all right? - You're not sick or anything, are you? - No. I'm OK. I'm fine. Hi. Ed McCleod? Hey. That's really nice. But it's a 289. How come you don't go with the 390? 289 is 200 pounds lighter. The way we have that set up, we can get 350 horsepower out of it. I, er... - I guess you're not Ed McCleod. - No, I guess I'm not. - I'm married to him. - Oh. The power behind the wheel, is that it? No, I just try to help out when I can. Ed will be back in a minute. Who, er... Who made your pistons? They're forged. They make them the way my husband likes them. Ed, this is Rick Bowman. He came to see you. Yeah. Nice to meet you. Grant Willard phoned. He told me you were coming. Here, Ellen, take a look at this. - Oh, is that the fuel bypass? - Yeah. - How did your header piece turn out? - It's right there, take a look. - Hey, that's a nice, neat, ladylike job. - Thank you. She's a good little welder. Hands steady as marble. Now, er, what can I do for ya? I'd like to back you at Phoenix. Grant knows about it. He told me to check with you. Hawk Sidney's backing me up. Not that I even need anybody. - That's Grant's idea, not mine. - I, erm... I guess you haven't heard. I beat Hawk Sidney last night. Oh, you did, eh? So you beat the great Hawk Sidney on that great dirt track figure eight. Now you're ready for the big time? Who do you think you are, Junior Johnson? Real racing isn't this cheap crash-bang stuff you're doing. - Grant... - Grant doesn't mean a thing he says. He told me all about your feud with Hawk. You can't pull stuff like that when you've gotta go 180 for 400 or 500 miles. That takes skill, patience and intelligence. Look, Willard put Hawk in this race to do one specific job. And if he kills himself, Willard will be the last one to cry about it. And I won't be the first, either. Guys like you and Hawk, roughnecks, you're not gonna be real race drivers. Look, you stick to your crash-bang stuff and get your kicks from that. You'll stay alive a lot longer. - Pass me that stinger. - Er, look, Mr McCleod, before you make up your mind so quickly, would you do me a favour? Would you give me a break? Watch me run in the modifieds tomorrow night. That seems fair, Ed. All right, fair enough. Thanks. Oh, er, take care of your beautiful friend here. How come you've turned into a grump all of a sudden? Ah, these guys. They're all alike. We're having a lot of fun here tonight. The cars are spinning, working through the pack, turning and twisting. Over the log! Oh, look out. It's like two bulls in a pasture. Who's gonna give up? Around and round they go, and where they stop... Look at this. Hey! Bang, pop, boom! Around the south turn, into the north turn. Look out!' Come on, Ed, don't be such a snob. I think figure eights are fun. 69 car head-on with 27, the 160, the 806. The world's longest stunt car there. Say, they're really jamming and pushing and shoving. The tow trucks are busy here tonight. The race is over. Ed Hand with the win. He's getting the trophy presentation. They're cleaning the track up now. My God! Never thought I'd see this old car of mine run so good, Rick. - Hey, give me a hand over here, will ya? - Sure, Rick. Well, you ain't gonna get very far like that, Rick. You'd better hurry. They're lining up. Hey, Jolene, run over to the tool box and get my hammer. Bowman starts behind The Hawk and then beside him is Charlie Heinz. Go ahead, honey, bust it, right here. Hey, you wanna see me win, don't you? - I don't wanna hurt you! - Just think of it as an act of love. Hit it! OK, I can move it now. There he is. The Hawk is out tonight to continue his winning ways. He has been winning in the stocks and the modifieds. Tonight in the modifieds for the first time is Rick Bowman, the young man from Palmdale, California, the drag racer that was a recent winner here of the stock car races. There's been a lot of rivalry between Bowman and The Hawk, but there's a lot of other cars on the track. These are the modified race cars the ones with the high-powered motors, the locked rear ends, the centre steering, the racing slicks - these are real fast! The bodies may be old, but the motors are new and they really go! These are the fast cars. There goes the green flag and they're off! These cars go 140 miles an hour... Look at these cars jump around! Sideways... Look out! Look out! The crowd is up on its feet! They're going on and on and on. The Fords, the Chevys, the Chryslers. All kinds of motors, all kinds of cars. Up and over but they keep on going. One of the logs is on the track. Bowman's doing a good job in the modifieds tonight. This is his first race in the modifieds. They're going crazy. There's a lot of pummelling and turning. They're going through. My God! North, south, east and west, they're coming from every side. They're not stopping. They're keeping on going. We haven't had a red flag yet. Bowman doing a very good job of driving tonight. And The Hawk is doing a good job of driving tonight. He doesn't seem to be playing games. There's a wheel off. There's a wheel loose on the track. Watch it now! Up and over! Up and over! They haven't stopped. Suddenly Hawk is out driving! He seems to be driving like a tyrant. Moore is the one they have to beat. Moore has built up a good lead in a good car. He's got a powerful car and he's out in front. But they're gaining all the time on him. I believe The Hawk is into second now. Moore is now in the lead, The Hawk is running second, Bowman is running third. They're trying to catch Moore, but I don't think they can. Moore out in front with a very, very powerful car. Bowman is behind The Hawk. Moore is in front. The Hawk should win, Bowman in second. The Hawk is coming down. The Hawk has spun out. Bowman wins it! Bowman in front for the chequered flag! Well, what do you think now, Ed? Yeah, he's pretty good, all right. For a rookie. He's very aggressive. Listen, Grant, er, I'll go along with whatever you say. This back-up car idea is your baby, anyway. Yeah. Now I'll tell you something I just found out today. Sonny Simpson is coming out to Phoenix to run the international. Sonny Simpson? Hey, I thought those southern champions were starting their season next week at Riverside. Most of them are. That's why Simpson figures he'll pick himself up an easy win at Phoenix and break in his new car at the same time. Thanks. - Did you see the little turn over there? - Yeah, you were fantastic! You drove a hell of a race, Rick. Thanks. Buy you a beer? Yeah. I'm sorry. Maybe I had it coming. Hi, Rick. Hey, listen, buddy, that was a real nice race. Hi, Ed. Thanks. Hi, Ellen. Hey, look, I'm sorry about the way I leaned on you. Oh, forget it. I, er... I heard about Sonny Simpson. Bad news travels fast. Oh, wait a minute, it could be good news, if you beat him. I can always tell when a man has an idea. What is it, Rick? I've been doing some checking around about Sonny Simpson. Seems he gets easily riled, doesn't expect any real competition at all. That's right. So? So why don't we give him some competition he won't believe, like a drag racer? - What the hell are you talking about? - Grant knows. Get my Chevy out of impound, drop the engine into a stock racer. Hawk can drive hell out of it, push that Alabama chicken farmer all the way. If my guess is right, he'll keep up rather than let a local boy steal his thunder. But your engine won't hold up like that for 400 miles. Right. But neither will Sonny's if he tries to keep pace. And I'll be driving back-up car to interfere with any competition. What does Hawk say? Look at him. He's out there leading the pack already. We can do it, Grant. We can win. Win. Hey, big Rick. Boy, you feel like you're about to explode. Maybe I will one of these days. What's wrong? How would you like to see me win the big race at Phoenix? I think that'd be great. - But what about Ed? - Oh, McCleod. I'm gonna see him eat my exhaust smoke. I always thought Ed was a pretty nice guy. He thinks he's such a big wheel. I hate people who think they're big wheels. I think you're a big wheel. Oh, you. You're awful damn good-looking, you know that? - Will you cut it out? - No, I mean it. You really are. Hey, what's your religion? I don't have any. I believe when you're dead, you're dead, and that's it. Not me. I believe in heaven. And I believe that... heaven is this great big island in the sky where everybody makes love in the sunshine with no shame at all. Oh, for the life of a race driver. This is Grant Willard's idea of a vacation. Sell the sponsor's product. Good machinery costs lots of money. It's gotta come from somewhere. Oh, it's not just the money. Willard doesn't understand. He doesn't have a wife or children. This machinery owns us. It owns Ed, body and soul. And I do mean body and soul. Wanna give you my love I wanna give you my heart Wanna love you, baby Till never part But if you don't want me Better tell me now I'll be on my way I'll get along somehow But if you do want me - Baby, say the word - ...the trial run this weekend. With the distance and the super-charger, I think we can get up to at least 125. Baby, I love you Baby, don't you leave me, I wanna make love to you Cos I love you, girl... Hi. Is there any place left in this world where there aren't any old beer cans? ...Sonny Simpson, one of the top drivers... There he goes, boys, the great Sonny Simpson himself. Down the back straight away, through the north turn. Looks like he's taking the chequered flag. Yeah, he knows how to go all right. Yeah. Now let's see if he knows how to take a few jabs of the old needle. Come on, baby, let's go. Sonny Simpson with a time of 24.63. The weather is turning and the track is fast. We have a breeze and there's dirt down on the south turn. We'll take a few moments to clear it up and be right back to qualifying. There he is, honey, the great celebrity hisself, Sonny Simpson. You know that chicken farmer I told you about? The one we gonna chew up and spit out like a mouthful of chicken feathers. You want somethin' around here, boy? See them big, tough-looking hands? He gets them for ringing all them chickens' necks! - Now, you look here, boy... - Oh! He's coming aftrr me, honey! Watch out! He's gonna whip the fire outta me! Help! Please don't hit me, please! Please! Easy, Sonny. He's trying to rile you. Don't give him no satisfaction. Who is that cowboy, anyway? Clock him when he qualifies. We're back to qualifying and on the track, car 62, driven by Bill Banner. Through the south turn. Down the back straight away. - Out of the north turn. And the chequered flag. Here's the time. 24.69. Coming out on the track, car number 6, driven by Hawk Sidney. And look at this boy go! And it looks like a fast one. It's going to be a fast one. The chequered flag. Hey, race fans, listen to this. Hawk Sidney's drive... Hey, Sonny, get a load of that. Three hundredths of a second faster than Sonny Simpson, the top modified driver. Yeah! Three more cars to qualify. A total of 24 cars to start the main event. She goes! Man, she goes! Watch out, you chicken plucker! Sonny Simpson, from the East Coast, Hawk Sidney... Better get your car ready, Rick. You're up pretty quick. Rick Bowman in the zero car. You feel OK, Rick? Yeah, sure. Why? 'The next car up is Rick Bowman, doing a great job of driving since he moved up to the modifieds. Rick Bowman climbing into the car. In a moment, he'll be on the track to qualify. All cars take one warm-up lap before taking the green flag to qualify. Down the front straight. Down the back straight away. Here he is, out of the turn. - 'And the time is 24.65.' - Hey, look at that. Our boy is really showing some stuff. - You think you can beat that? - I think I'd better. ...the third fastest time of the day. Some of these local boys turned in pretty good times, Sonny. This ain't gonna be any raccoon hunt like we figured. Remember, race fans, the big one gets underway, the main event, 24 cars, starting at 2:30 tomorrow afternoon. Are you worried about tomorrow? Boy, these cigarettes. I've gotta quit this smoking. Bad for the nerves. I'll be glad when it's all over. Me, too. You, er, haven't exactly been seeing too much of me lately, have you? No, I haven't. Poor kid. Listen, I've been thinking. Aftrr tomorrow, it'll be over for a while. How about a vacation? I mean just the two of us all by ourselves. - What about Riverside? - Oh, yeah. - Riverside. - It's only a week away. Well, we just won't go. We can afford to skip one race out of the whole season. I don't think Grant Willard would like that. Grant Willard. Who's he, anyway? Look, if he won't allow it... ...well, I'll just fail to qualify, that's all. Sure you will. Hey, as a matter of fact, if I win tomorrow, - why don't we start raising that family? - If you win? Oh, hell, win or lose, it's a promise, OK? Ed, don't say that unless you really mean it. I do, honey. I do. Look, I want you to have all the things that women need. I love you. Oh, Ed, I love you. Rick! You might get killed tomorrow. Excuse me. Good night, fun boy. You're right, you know? I could get killed tomorrow. Hey, don't say that. You're crazy, you know that? Oh, Rick, I'm so scared you're gonna get hurt tomorrow. - Is that wrong? - I don't know. I can't ever remember anybody else caring. Honey, I... I gotta get some sleep. Rick! What's the matter with you lately? What do you mean? What's the matter with you? You see what I mean? You just... You just get mad at me for nothing! Oh, it's the strain of this race. I feel as though I've been walking around in a dream all day. All I can think of is... we gotta win. Hey. I don't care if you win or lose. I just want you. What do you mean, you don't care? Isn't that why you latched onto me, so you could have a winner? You're just like Grant Willard. Well, any time I win a race, I won't have anyone else to thank for it. 'Main event time coming up here at Phoenix in just a few moments. In the meantime, let's take a quick intermission. - What's that for, Rick? - It's an idea I got last night. I'm welding steel reinforcements behind the fenders. If I knock other cars, I wanna be sure nobody digs my fenders in against the tyres and blows them out. An idea you got last night, eh? I must say, you work pretty fast, Rick. Well, any sacrifice to give our beloved Ed McCleod a better chance, right? Rick, I'll tell you something I've been thinking. I'm a businessman. So long as a California Custom car wins this race, I really don't care very much what the name of the driver is. Race fans, this is the one you've been waiting for, the main event! There's the green flag and we're racing! Hawk Sidney in car number 6. Car number 63, Sonny Simpson, the modified champion, trying out the local track in a warm-up for the big one in January at Riverside. And we've got a spin! The 11 car, they're bouncing it all over the track. One car out at the south turn. Two more cars out of the battle in the north turn. Here's the rundown. Sonny Simpson in the lead, car number 63. Moving up fast in car number 6, Hawk Sidney. And he's pushing the leader. Down to the inside with a half a car-length on Sonny Simpson. Simpson pours it on and it's a see-saw battle for the lead. Sidney goes back into the lead. It's going to be a battle to see who can last the longest. They race forward down the main straight away. Simpson tries it again around the outside. Ed McCleod in car number 554 is moving up to third. And it's another spin! Here's your race. Sonny Simpson and Hawk Sidney. Hey, there's something wrong with The Hawk. He's slowing down. Sonny Simpson goes back into the lead. Ed McCleod now moves it into second place. And Rick Bowman in the zero car has taken over third. Hawk Sidney's pulling into the pits. He's out of the race with a blown engine. Sonny Simpson in car number 63, moving through traffic like a wild man! It seems like he's driving way over his head, trying to put distance over second place Ed McCleod. Down the back straight away. We've got a spin! Car number 63, Sonny Simpson. And it looks like it's all over for the modified champ. Sonny Simpson is in the infield and he's OK. Here's the new line-up. Ed McCleod's in the lead, Rick Bowman running second and car number 28 running in third. Here comes Bowman through traffic, moving up on the leader, Ed McCleod. And on the south turn, we've got a spin. Bowman's right on the bumper of the leader. It's going to be a race right down to the wire. McCleod still hangs onto the lead. Bowman pushing and shoving. A little fender polo as they head onto the back straight away. Bowman chasing McCleod and Ed McCleod loses it right in the middle of the track! Here comes two more cars... McCleod's just been hit hard. He may be hurt. And Rick Bowman in the zero car down the back. He's the new leader. There's the wave. Ed McCleod seems to be OK. And the ambulance over to check. Rick Bowman in the zero car, out of the turn, takes the chequered flag! Bowman wins the big one in the zero car. Man, what a race! Man, you've never seen any better than this! Your second spot going to the 28 car of Marty Quaid. And third going to car number 16, Eddie Chapman. Well, that's it, race fans. That wraps it up, it's all over. We'll see you next Sunday aftrrnoon for more fine racing! Hey, Moody. Where is everybody? Oh, Mr Willard and all the others went to the hospital with Ed. The great McCleod sprains a toenail, we declare a national emergency? I don't know, must've been serious. Yeah. Must've been. He's dead! Hello, Rick. Whiplash broke his neck. If he hadn't walked to the ambulance, he might be all right. No-one blames you, Rick. Everybody in the race is out to win. You'll race next week at Riverside. California Custom needs a winner. Are you with me, Rick? How about it, Rick? Let's go. Jolene? We're going to Riverside. Are you coming? I don't like you anymore, Rick.
