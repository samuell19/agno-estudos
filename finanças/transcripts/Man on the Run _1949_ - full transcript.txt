No A flying bomb hit the house where we lived My father was killed outright my sister was very badly injured I asked for compassionate leave came home Fixing up as best as I could and that was that Two days before my time was up The doctor told us my sister might not pull through My mother was frantic I wired for an extension but it was refused Refused because I was single So I took it Three days later my sister died But I was with her That's all I asked after four years that's all I asked and they refused Within two days my mother followed her Shock and everything was too much So I didn't go back Well,do you believe any of this or am I just wasting my time?

We're looking for a man who was last seen in this street We have reason to believe he's hiding in one of these buildings -You alone? -Yes Did you see or heard anything unusual in the past quarter of an hour? Only the raid on the café I saw it from upstairs -You sure that's all? -Yes I see I think we have a look anyway You have a look upstairs -Well? -No one upstairs No way out on to the roof -What's your name,Madam -Adams,Jean Adams -Mrs? -Yes,I'm a widow -You work anywhere? -Yes at "Weatherbin" in Oxford Street Tell me Mrs.Adams Why did you take so long to answer the door?

I get up very early I work hard,you know I'm so tired this morning I didn't even make the bed So I noticed All right Mrs.Adams,sorry to have troubled you -All right -Yes Thank you You can't go out they're searching the street You're right If I was seen leaving here now from this house hard for you It's a crime to shield a deserter Especially one in my position Look I feel terrible about all this You look as if you could do with a drink I've got a little brandy Thank you -Your husband ? -Yes -Killed in action? -No,died of wound I'm sorry Were you very fond of him? We were separated He thought he'd find someone else Divorce? No,war broke out he joined up and he let things drift Everyone seemed to at that time Just before Dunkirk he was badly wounded and sent back When he came out of hospital He was alone It was no one to look after him So I let him come back here He had a relapse and they operated again It was no use Why am I telling you all this? I don't know Maybe because you wanted to talk to somebody like I did just now What's your name?

I can't shield myself behind you Especially now I know about your husband I got to get out of here I can without you getting mixed in it Look you're safe here and I'm going to help you -Why? -I don't know Perhaps it's because you so badly need help Besides it's no use running away You're caught up in a murder And somehow you've got to get yourself out of it Yes,I could if I knew I could find those two men That's impossible Apart from what they were wearing all I've got to go on is the voice of one of them Tall thin man with half the two middle fingers missing on his left hand Where they've been shut off Yes,a voice I can remember anywhere with a strong Australian accent "I'm getting you a toothbrush!" -Very good morning Mrs Adams -Good Morning Tony -You're very early I only just opened -I know I wondered if you could let me have a little milk I've got it,Rosa put some milk in her bottle for Mrs Adams -Thank you Tony -That's all right -I want some cigarettes -Sorry no cigarettes -20 players that's all right -That's fine That's a 3sh 6p for the cigarettes -I'll give you the milk -Thank you How long have you been smoking,eh?

Apparently the whole district being watched Here's the toothbrush and I brought you some cigarettes and a paper Thank you They haven't published your description They never do it might prejudice their case in court It's in the hands of every policeman in the country -That's just as bad -I'll get some breakfast "Martin's killers: There were three of them. The third one was wearing a raincoat. A thorough search for the third man is underlay ..All the restaurants and private places in the respective part of the city are being searched ..."﻿ -You say he had a moustache -Yes,definitely It's our man all right He must have shaved it off between getting rid of this and going to that pub Is the raincoat any use to you? I doubt it these people must have turned out thousands like this all exactly the same No chance for checking any of them Still will take it along with us -And thanks for your cooperation -That's all right There you are Thank you Here you are -Am I glad to see you! -Getting nervous Very I'm afraid being cooped, up here all alone like this Not that I'm not grateful Mrs.Adams Hadn't you better call me Jean seems you're likely to be here sometime Yes I suppose I should Do you mind if I see that? They know the type of gun that was used -What's the matter? -Nothing -Yes,there is,what is it? -Nothing,nothing to it really -Tell me something -Yes What type of gun is yours? Why? What makes you ask? I just want to know 38 Enfield Same type that one that killed the policeman Yes -You don't doubt me do you? -Is that what's worrying you ? -Partly -No If you did I think that would be about the end It becomes dangerous to you must get rid of it Have you tried to get rid of anything in a place like London in broad daylight? We'll get rid of it tonight I'll throw it in the river What are you doing,Miss? Don't think you're throwing yourself over,are you? No,of course not -Just getting a breath of fresh air -I see A bit late for that sort of thing isn't it? -Oh I don't know -Can I see your identity card,please? That's all right thank you -Bert! -Hello Come up here a minute -What's the matter? -I want to show you something Look -Where did that spring from? -The bridge as we come under it I heard something fall and found it They're looking for the gun,aren't they? It says so in today's papers -That's the one-God.. -Don't touch it Leave that for the police Ain't you ever heard of such things as fingerprints? Oh,cut him! Who's been filling you up with that stuff? A gentleman by the name of Dick Thorton(?) Gone it's at the bottom of the river -I had a little trouble with a policeman -What? Nothing serious luckily he didn't see me drop it over -He thought I was going to throw myself -What did he do? Not much just had a look at my identity card -Suppose he makes a report? -Why should he? I wasn't doing anything The second time you've been in contact with the police through me isn't it? But I told you he didn't see me drop the revolver I'm sure OK may be not He thought you were going throw yourself in and he's got your name and address And last night they searched that address because they thought you might be hiding me Well they've only got to get those two things connected up somehow and they want to know more about you They'll come here again I've got to get out of here now For your sake you must see that -Perhaps you're right -I know I'm right Look I got a little money saved from my pension Not much but enough to last you for quite a while and I know somewhere you can go somewhere on the coast we'll be perfectly safe once you get away from this place I can give you a change of clothes and everything my husband's things are still here I'll phone and fix it in the morning what do you say? What can I say -Why not try saying yes -I can't take your money You are only alone until you get yourself straightened out I can never really do that you know Yes you can listen Tomorrow's my Saturday half-day We'll take a chance on getting away after dark I'll come down with you stay over Sunday That'll give us the whole day in the fresh air to discuss things properly Why are you doing all this for me? I told you last night I don't know -Good Morning -Good Morning,Rosa -May I use your phone? -Certainly -Good Morning Mr Sweeney -Good Morning,Sir You're the chap that found this gun aren't you? That's right,Sir It fell off of Waterloo Bridge just Exactly I'm afraid I got a disappointment for you This revolver is the same type as the murder weapon but it wasn't one that fired the shot However it might belong to one of the other two gunmen involved we can't tell you Lucky my mate didn't mess up with the fingerprints,isn't it? There were no fingerprints However thanks for your cooperation we let you if we want you again -Is that all? -Yes,that's all,thank you Unless you have a guilty conscience -Good morning -Good morning Pity about them fingerprints You are telling us He didn't seem to want to go -Perhaps he likes it here, well? -Nothing -No trace of the man at all? -No none at all Can't understand it? What is he? Another Houdini Look,this is ridiculous A man can't just run down a street and disappear he's still in that district I'll stake my bottom dollar on that Lawson You do the rounds at the cafés again tonight Take every man you can lay your hands on them and do the job thoroughly -Very good Sir -When somebody's hiding got to eat somewhere I want that man he's our one and only lead and he's not going to get away A shilling Who's the driver's cab BLF 405? I am why? We have our own car to pick you up -What for? -They want a word with you at the Yard -What me? -Yes you -What about? -You'll find out when you get there -What about my supper is pie -Come on get a move on We can't wait all night Well I'm going down old Compton Street when this woman nails me Hop in lady says -anywhere you like -You slay me -Where did you take her Blackpool? -She wanted to go Victoria Station But had to pick up someone first And Victoria's where I dropped them You can't tell us what he looked like She paid the fare the bloke I hardly so at all Where were they going do you know? I haven't the faintest idea Is that all? Then went straight back to the shelter and ordered me supper And I'd very much like to go back to it if you don't mind All right you can And how may I ask am I to get there? What's the matter with the taxi He was a great help I don't know three men killed one of our chaps in broad daylight and where are we Nowhere even though we've caught up with one of them he runs down a street and disappears No it's not good enough those baskets had all the luck so far What about this man the Adams girl went to Victoria with,Sir? Probably nothing in it at all Look There was no one with her in the flat that night that chap got away was there? -No -In fact that lets her out That bloke tonight could have been anybody How about boyfriends I know the district Married man probably -Still we'll see -She didn't look that type to me,Sir Lawson I envy you,you got a very beautiful mind -Good morning -Oh hello How would you like a swim? I think I can borrow some things Nothing I'd like better -I'll see what I can do -All right That's the first time I've seen you smile -Enjoy your swim? -Wonderful -Your name is Peter isn't it? -That's right -My name is May -Where is Andy? Stealing the ticket(?), oh it is nice to see you again Jean I must sit down have a chat I shouldn't really of course I'm supposed to be doing the books this morning There's always something to be done in a Pub -I know -You were in this line too? I was,are you very busy this time of the year? Doesn't make much difference really customers are a bit thirsty I suppose Only a local chain(?)you know We only got the two rooms you are in anyway and they are hardly ever let Too quiet for most people What are you going to do? Perhaps you like the sea without trimmings like this place Get's on my nerves sometimes -Good morning -Good morning Andy Can you speed the pop Mary -Pop that is coming -You don't mind do you Jean? -You're the governor -I sometimes wonder What's going in town now Jean? -Go and see any of the old gang? -No,not now What do you do with yourself then? My job keeps pretty busy for one thing Well I find plenty to do What do you think of this Golden street shooting ? I don't know what things are coming to They pull a gun on you as soon as look at you nowadays It's all these ruddy deserters that's what it is Anything about on the wireless? Not much they're still looking for the chap they nearly caught the other night Why on earth they don't publish a description of him I don't know You ever miss the band business Mr Baker? Yes and no sometimes I think I'd like to go back to it But not on the trombone,mind you Band my own the next time I'd make a good conductor you know You certainly would on a bus You have to say things like that Why don't you try to relax I can't Look at that incident at breakfast these things with me all the time Yes,I can see that Jean,do you know how many deserters there are? Nearly 20,000 20,000 men on the run all over the country men with no hope and no future They say they should like to give themselves up and go to jail That's just what they won't do instead of thinking they will They all had some reason for deserting Human nature is human nature all world over That's what the authorities won't make allowances for If those men were allowed to start afresh From the clean slate it all become useful members of the community again As it is most of them are forced to live by crime,crime of every sort including murder Now that's what I wanted for Peter I was wondering if ever you find this man, the man you want, what exactly would you do? Make him talk and he would How do you know? Because he's not the man who fired the shot and I know it He'd soon open up to try and save his own skin And I'd hand him over and make him clear me You mean you'd hand him over to the police? -Yes, -And yourself too? Yes I suppose so I have to Then you'd be free wouldn't you? Free to start again,that's what you really want isn't it to start all over again There's no use talking like this I shall never find him it's impossible You got to somehow,Peter,you just got to What do you make of Jean and her boyfriend,May? -What do you mean what I make them? -I mean,do you think they're in love? What do you think come down here for if they are not? The best thing that could have happened to Jean She's been alone far too long That's natural whatever she thinks it's no use caring ??around her for the rest of her life She's a good kid I'd do anything for Jean High time she had some happiness for a change I'm not arguing I just thought they looked a little on edge that's all Wouldn't you'll be in the same circumstances? Oh I see what you mean Nothing of the sort The trouble with you is you judge other people by your own low standards That's because you used to do that sort of thing yourself Well you ought to know I shall have to leave early in the morning,Peter I've got to go home change before I go to work I hate leaving at all but here you are -When are you coming back? -Saturday do you want me to? You know I do I feel almost human again You and this place I'd almost forgotten the reason I'm here You've been wonderful,Jean I don't know what I'd have done without you Or what I do now -Jean -Yes It happened didn't it? Yes -When did you know? -Today earlier on What are we going to do, there's no future for you with me -Yes there is -No,not as I am now We're not going to give up Where is it all going to end We'll find a way out somehow Good morning Mrs. Adams I'm a police officer perhaps you remember me? -Yes I think I do -Do you mind if I came in a moment? I'd like to ask you a few questions No,not at all? Now Mrs Adams we're very interested in the man you went to Victoria Station with on Saturday night I've been being watched then? We're making a note of anything unusual that happens around here just now What's so unusual about a man leaving a woman's flat? In the ordinary way nothing but this particular man didn't want to be seen leaving that's all so we found the taxi and checked up on you who was he? -A friend -What was his name? -Brian? -Brian what? I think it was Parkson -You just think? -I only met him that night -Yet you brought him back here? -Yes I brought him back for a drink I see What was he like? Medium built dark curly hair and a thin face Why did you go to Victoria with him? I didn't,he came with me I just gave him a lift that's all Where'd he went after I left him I had no idea You mean you were the one going to the station? Yes that's right But he went into the station with you didn't he? Yes,yes of course he did he came in with me but I left him going to the bar -Where he went after that -You've no idea I know You've told me and where did you go? -Away for the weekend -On your own? -Yes,I was alone -Where? And I must warn you Mrs Adams, you'd better tell the truth If you don't we'll soon know And that means that I should have to come and call on you again -The anchor Hotel Felty in Sussex -Thank you About this man again you're sure he is what you say he was? Someone you met casually that night and brought up here Yes,not against the law is it? No but you surprised me,Mrs. Adams I'd never have believed it Appearances are often deceptive, you know,Inspector Sergeant Some kids have found a gun in the mud at Wapping Another Enfield 38 having it tested now This time we may have got something,what's your news? Only the Adams girls ,Sir,according to her you were right she swear she was only giving someone a lift someone's had just met them taking back with her for a drink All right there's no need to look -so depressed about it -It's not that,Sir It's just that I don't believe it Where were she over the weekend?

You hid him and you threw his gun over Waterloo Bridge didn't you? Look Mrs Adams why don't you be sensible and make things easier to yourself We want that man and we mean to get him He's a dangerous gunman and he's concerned in the murder of a policeman He's not a gunman and he's not concerned in a murder So you do know him? Well supposing you tell us what he is concerned in and exactly where you come into the picture He's concerned in clearing himself and I'm helping him This is interesting Mrs Adams Who is he? -A deserter -That doesn't surprise me But he's done for your service that's all forgotten of course Only you want to do now is put him in prison That's hardly the point We're interested in his connection with a murder He had no connection with it at all He went into the jeweller to sell that revolver He took the gun out of his pocket There was a hold-up I see,go on You know what happened then Why didn't he come to us? How could he in his position would you believed him anyway? No his only chance was to find those two men himself And I think we have found one of them,today -Who's in this house? -What's that to do with you? Come along we are police officers -Who's in this house? -Only me We'll see about that Go on up you go Nothing upstairs only the men's clothes -Well,where are they? -You've not right to come here Don't start that where are these two gentlemen friends -You've been entertaining here -What do you mean?Entertaining I'll give you two guesses I want to know where they are and who they are I don't know what you're talking about -What's your name? -Lily Lily what? Lily Gatehouse Lily you are a smart girl I can see that You know the answers don't you? I wonder if you know the answer to this one We're looking for two men One of them may have two fingers missing on his left hand These two men are wanted in connection with the murder of a policeman We shall get him in the end,you know Lily Make no mistake about that and afterwards we find out that you've been shielding them That's puts you in it,doesn't it? And we should come back for you on a murder charge So Lily you're the smart girl I think you are You got something to tell us haven't you? All right Good well who are they? -Two deserters -Names? The one with the fingers shot off is called Slim -Slim what? -Slim Elfey -Australian? -No but he lived there for years -The other one? -Dan -Dan Underwood -How long have they been here? Some months now But I had no idea that they'd anything to do with the shooting I swear it Not until the man who was at jeweller's shop What man? We are waiting to hear about him That man who came to see them -What did he look like? -Medium build fresh complexion? Brown hair,blue eyes is that the man? Yes I think so Well what did they talk about ? I don't know They sent me out of the room Where are they now? They went off with him in a car Did he go willingly or did they perhaps persuaded at the point of a gun -Slim persuaded him -Where do they go to? -I don't know -Where did they get the car? -Pinched it -Where from? I don't know,honestly I don't Somewhere around here I think Very useful All right that'll do for now Take her away It looks to be something in your story,Mrs. Adams I'm afraid they've got your friend Burden They took him away from that house two of them In a car Say he walked to the car that's something Cut me in please? What are you going to do? We haven't finished them yet that car was stolen Just as soon as we get the number we should have to pick it up inside a quarter of an hour -Haven't you got its number yet then ? -No, one they took somewhere outside a theatre just after performance started -Theatre? -Yes That gives them two hours before the loss was discovered by then they ??? -Take it down to records,please -Yes,Sir There isn't a theatre open this time in the morning There must be -Stop,they wouldn't dare to risk anything else -Which one? That's just what we are finding out now I bid you to have to interrupt the picture and make an announcement? -What's the trouble -We want to know if a car has been stolen from outside this teller get everyone who's parked their car outside to come out here at once Hello cars from information room message number 43 Stolen black Austin saloon Index number MML eight seven four Outside Cambridge Theatre Durham Street WC2 Approximate time 1100 hours Time of origin 11:35 I told you last night not to come down here again didn't I -I don't want either of you -We want him upstairs You know why,this is trouble -And I don't want any trouble -It isn't so much you want it what you get it You've done pretty well of chaps I got,Charlie You have to take the good with the bad How bad is it then This is the bloke who was in Collin's shop last Thursday Nearly an hour now we're on the right track that car is being hidden somewhere Must have reach there before our message went out Where,that's the point -Isn't it anything you can do? -Mrs. Adams We're doing everything we possibly can You came in on this a little late,you know It wasn't our fault Now then between the time the car left her house and the time it's description was broadcast it couldn't possibly get outside a radius of say three miles from the cherry so to speak That puts it roughly somewhere here Wapping That's where those kids found that revolver,isn't it? I can't have you three hanging around here -I'll tell you I can't have -There won't be three after tonight Oh no,oh no you don't You thought you got rid of that revolver last night,didn't you? It was just found out there this morning in the mud They've been busy around here all day I'm not having any stiffs in the house Why can't you leave me alone Can't you have other places you can go? No there aren't and you know it You've taken anything we've brought in the past haven't you? and being glad of it you'd have taken anything that was going from Collins place if there'd been anything You're in this with us Charlie right up to your ears and make no mistake about it -stop whining and start doing something -What can I do We got to get out of the country You can fix it if the money's there we know that And you've got the money haven't you? sooner you get things started the sooner you'll get rid of us How about that fellow upstairs? I'm not having any murder done here We are dealing with that as soon as it's dark -What are you going do? -Take him down the river Hold him under for a few minutes Then let him go suicide I don't like it,and how about that car? You got rid of plenty of others you can get rid of that one There's nothing to connect us with it Where exactly was that revolver found? Just here the children were playing there at low tide and saw it's sticking out of the mud Very well then we'll cover this section say from here to here And take one of your cars You people do the rest I want every garage dock and yard in the district opened and searched in that any place large enough to take that car Right Hello OK You're dead lucky everything's fixed He'll slip you on board all three of you and drop you off at Belfast Why three of us all of us suddenly? Because the ship sails in less than an hour you'll have to go now and take that chip with you and alive you understand? How do you get rid of him afterwards is up to you As long you all get out of here I don't care But this is going to cost money a lot of money All I can afford The only thing you can afford Charlie is to let us down And you would wouldn't you? if you thought you could get away with it I wouldn't touch your yard(?) if there was any trouble Well there isn't going to be any trouble so that's that You can get rid of this bloke(?) over the side that is if your girl(?) has given away(?) and they are on the way in the morning He wont know anything as long as he is paid And you are going to pay him,aren't you,Charlie? So there we are they're all set -How far is the ship from here? -Not far OK come on let's get him He must have jumped out He's gone away all right -He's gone -Never mind about that,look They're searching the street they're looking for something I know what it is It's the car your rotten liars you told me they couldn't connect you with it Those are not local men there must be Scotland Yard What are we going to do You mean what are you going to do don't you,Charlie? Everything around for now(?)
