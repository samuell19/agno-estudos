"The whole world is a stage." "Men and women all are mere actors." "Everyone makes their entrances. Everyone makes their exits." And throughout our lives, we play many roles. - Did you know them well? - Well, not really. - And you, did you know them? - No one knew them. Ah, that's easy. Well boss, there's nothing to be learned from the neighbors. Okay, go ahead. I'm coming. They never paid rent on time, you know. One might think that they do it on purpose so we have to disturb you. Listen, sir, I've got no time to waste. Please get to the facts. - Yes, the facts. The facts. - Yes, the facts! Well I walked in and she was sitting in front of him who was lying dead. Like a corpse, I guess. I couldn't get a word out of her, so I called you right away. You didn't touch anything, right? Okay well thank you. Speak to my colleague and leave him your contact details. So, what happened? Hey! Can you hear me? Do not bother boss, she seems a bit deranged. Well, I found her papers. She wasn't married to him, nor was he her father. Her name is Simone. Why didn't you call us? What happened!? - Hey! - Ah! Don't touch me! Well, that's enough for now. Let's take her in! Come on you, let's go. Hurry up. Was I right to arrest her? What do you think? Me, boss? I'd do the same as you, boss. Poor guy. - No one heard the gunshot? - No, boss. No one was in the house. Simone is here. My name is Jean-Pierre Laubray. I've been asked to defend you. Are you okay? I mean prison, is it okay? It's okay. Are you my lawyer? Yes, why? Do you want to change to someone else? You can, if you want. I actually know one. I know a very good lawyer. A very bright one. - Do you have money? - Oh no, I have no money. There's no point discussing it then. It's out of question. It's not worth wasting my time. - But I am innocent! - Of course. But how do you know? Well, let's recap. The man you lived with was found dead in your home. Yes, but... But when I got home I found him like that on the floor. Normally I always stay at home. But I was so annoyed. I had to go out to get some fresh air. Otherwise, I'm normally at home. I should have stayed at home. Something was wrong that evening? I was so angry. Where did you go for a walk? Well, I don't know, I just went out and about. I went out to get some air, walked through the streets. But I shouldn't have, I should have stayed at home. Well. Is it over now, can I go? As you wish. Listen. I saw him the day before. He called me and asked me to quickly bring him his papers and all his money. He had arranged to meet me at the caf√© at the Gare de l'Est. - You're hurting me. - The house. Is the house monitored? Were you followed? No, don't look back! Don't be afraid. You're going to go home, that's it. - Do you have what I asked for? - Yes. - But Jean, tell me what's going on. - Nothing. Don't wait for me tonight or tomorrow morning. Okay? I will call you as soon as I can. - But what's going on?! - Are you crazy? Be quiet. Don't panic. Do not panic. - It's me, it's only me. - But... Why are they following me? To find me. It's not you, it's me who's being followed. They followed you to find me. It was stupid to ask you to come. But I didn't think that they were going to be so quick. - Please don't leave me home alone. - Do as I say. - Please, I beg you Simone! - It's not the place to cause a scene. Yes, sir, I will reimburse you. How much do I owe you? - One franc twenty for everything. - Hold on, here you go. Thank you, sir! Simone. Don't be afraid. Don't be afraid. Do you understand? Okay, listen. There are people who are mad at me. I'm being followed, you see? I have to hide. I have no other option but to get myself sent to jail. Yes, I'm gonna get arrested on purpose by committing a minor crime in front of the police, so they have to arrest me. - Do you follow? - No, not really. You do. I'll make a mistake in front of the police, and then stay in prison for a while. Something minor. I won't be in prison for a long time. Do you get it? Eh? Yes. Okay, leave it to me. I'm going to go now. As soon as I'm gone, you go home. Go home, okay? Yes? The guy who was following you. You have no idea who it could be? Ravier never talked about his work. And he didn't like questions. What was Ravier's job? I don't know. You don't have anything to eat on you, do you? No. - What do you want? - Salami. - Dried or with garlic? - Dried. I will bring you some next time. In the file I was given, it said the owner of a suburban bistro was murdered with bullets from Ravier's revolver. The bistro is called "la Grande Borne." Does it ring a bell? What I don't understand is, if Ravier had killed this woman, why did he try to surrender to the police? - He didn't kill her! - Are you sure? He would have told me. Did he tell you everything? What was his job? - I told you he didn't kill anyone! - Why did Ravier have a gun? Leave me be, leave me alone! Madam, please come quickly, madam! - Is it over? - Yes. We are at the bar. It's ten minutes away from here. What! You are completely crazy. My friend's a good guy, he's decent. Damn it, hang up! I'm telling you they'll come. Huh? - Have you seen his bike? - Damn it, hang up! Don't worry, they'll come. - Do you need the phone, sir? - No, thank you. In two hours?! No, that's too long for us. - This is ridiculous. - I want to talk to your sister. - It's on. - It's a flop. Listen, I'll call you later. Bye. He uses the phone for an hour and doesn't buy a single drink. - Can I make a call please? - It's out of order! I can do without customers like you, thank you very much. Okay, give me everything in the cash register. Quickly! You've got some balls, boy! - Shut up! - No harm done. - Come on, hurry! - Yes, okay, I understand. - What's going on? - Can't you see! - Don't move. - You're gonna get the hell out! - Or you'll see! - Don't move! - It's you who will move! - Don't shoot! - Catch him! He shot my wife, hurry! - Get inside! Let go of that child. Okay but you're gonna let me get out. I just want to talk with you, nicely and calmly. Kindly, politely, calmly! So kindly and calmly you're gonna let me out! If you let go of this child. You're going to bring me a car with the engine running, okay? - Let go of that child! - A car! A car, with the engine running. A car! If you try to stop me, I'm going to shoot her, okay? If you leave me alone, I will leave her alone. Do as he says. Go get a car. Hurry up! Okay, we are doing what you wanted. Don't touch or do anything to her. I promise, if you release her quickly, we won't pursue you. - The car is here. - Get away! You too! You too! You there, get out of the way. Come on! Don't be fools, step away! - Tell them. - Come on, step aside. Kids, step aside. Don't move. Don't be a fool. You there! Step away! Don't follow me! Step away! I would like you to tell me what happened in the car with the man when you were alone. After leaving the school. I am here sweetheart, don't be afraid. Well, we drove. His car was fast, it was fun. What a story! You're quite courageous to do that. And why did you do it exactly? Where are we going? Are you going to ask my grandmother for money? You know, she's not very rich. You won't get much. I'm not against you as long as you don't hurt me. But you'll have to be very careful because everyone saw you back there. It won't be easy. - You are so boring. - I didn't come looking for you. Well, come on, go away. And so? - So, I left. - He let you go. Yes. Didn't they follow you? The agents promised not to. And anyone else? I didn't look. And him, didn't you notice if he looked in his mirror? I don't know. - Am I bothering you? - No you are not bothering me. Maybe a little bit, no? No need for formality, Marie. Why? Because I think I'll annoy you less that way. - How did you get home? - A trucker, he brought me back. I told you to leave. Forgive me. Why did you tell the man, "Forgive me"? I don't know. He looked annoyed, he was alone and I couldn't help it. - I apologized. - It's normal. I forgive you but go away, come on. Can I do anything for you? - No, go away. - Will you die? I won't die, now go away. Come on. I'll stay in the hall. If you don't want to see me, I can leave. I can get some else to come. So? Otherwise you have to help me. You must not sulk like that. Hmm? Well, shit, I will count to ten and then... if you refuse to talk to me, I will leave. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. I've just come from the suburban bistro. Ravier is the one who killed the woman. Yes. - I tell you that Ravier killed that woman. - And I'm telling you he didn't. Well. It was Ravier who killed the woman, and they shot him. But he didn't die because of that. He died, later on, from a bullet from his own revolver fired at a close range. So there are two options, either he committed suicide, or we want to make everyone believe that he committed suicide. And that's what the police think. What? You want us to believe that he killed himself. Me? - You're not going to cry. - But I'm not crying! All this is... - Did Ravier beat you? - You're mad! Ravier was kind, that's why he stayed with me. He should have been with someone else. There was another girl he was in love with. But... I tried to leave him several times. Each time he would find me and bring me back. - Do you know this girl? - Yes, very well. Sir? Can I see Mrs. Bayrent please? How did you get in? Through the door. There was a young girl, she let me in and she told me to come up. This house is amazing. What do you want? I'm a lawyer. I'm responsible for defending Simone Ild. Accused of the murder of Jean Ravier. Madam Bayrent might have some helpful information on Jean Ravier. Madam is not here. - You're not limping? - No, why? - The arm. - Oh, the arm. Unfortunately, it's true. I saw him on the eve of his death, he had an appointment. With who? Who was he meeting with? He was going to check Cristiani's electoral billboards. Isn't Cristiani the guy whose son was recently killed in a car crash? I don't know. It's the guy who is running for office. What are you waiting for? I am waiting for Decarbe. For once, I was free. It's the job. I don't know if I can see you tomorrow. Yes I know, it's no fun. - Saying it doesn't change anything. - I know. - Here he is. - Are you going to be here for a while? No, but let's count the electoral posters after. Again? - Hi. - Hello. Hello, Juditte. - Can you wait for me for five minutes? - No thanks, I'll take a taxi. - Goodbye. - See you later. So? - Ready? - Yes, ready. He was not an interesting guy. Unfortunately, we don't have much choice doing this kind of job. What exactly were you using him for? Oh, for information, here and there, from his circles. Clubs in Montmartre. I didn't have much to do with him really. He was an anxious type, not very easy to handle. - Did you see him on the eve of his death? - It was a coincidence. I'd be grateful if you would keep this to yourself, do you understand? - He was also interested in politics. - Oh really? You think? You didn't know that? No, not at all. You know it's very hard to know everything about this type of a person. - Politics, you said, but in what exactly? - I don't know. You are right. If he was interested in politics, it was because he was being paid. I only say that because I can't see Ravier act out of personal conviction. - Are you sure about your sources? - No. No, I can't remember who mentioned this to me. Mm. No, I don't know. Yeah. In any case, I... I will do some research on that. I'm sorry to not be of much help. It's rather you who gave me a lead. Do you still have questions for me? No. No, not for now. Okay well then good luck. May I know why you want to see my husband? I'd rather not bother you with this, madam. Does this involve my son? Honestly, I don't know. - Do you want to sit down? - No. I must see Mr. Cristiani, madam. Does my husband know you? No. Please let Mr. Cristiani know someone's here to see him. He's been very busy recently. An election campaign. I never imagined what it would be like. It's empty here. It's too big. Deep down, I never liked this house. You have a daughter, I believe. She only comes home to sleep. Theater is her passion presently. She has always been passionate about many things. - Don't you want to sit down? - No, thank you. For example, she played the piano really well. Then suddenly, one day, she had had enough of it. It's in her nature. She skis remarkably, too. Ah, that's good. - Do you ski? - No, thank you. No, not at all. He is busy. You can make an appointment with his secretary at his office. That's a shame, but I guessed that might be the case. Can I can be of any use to you? I don't think so, but thank you. Okay, good bye then. - He is quite bright and wasted no time. - It was quite unexpected. Usually lawyers of his age who are court-appointed are bright. Anyhow. I thought about changing Simone Ild's lawyer but it could seem odd. That said, it shouldn't be difficult to get her released. There is still no proof against her. She clearly knows nothing. But... She was the one who spoke of you to Laubray? No. I have an idea who did. And it's a lead that won't take him very far. He knows I saw Ravier on the eve of his death. But he doesn't know that I saw him again the next morning. In other words, after the incident. Hey. Hey. I don't have much time. You've got yourself in a mess. A big mess. I was acting in self-defense. And the police? I've done my job. - I saw a massacre. - Your job was to watch and listen. That's all. - Arrest me! - Really? On top of that, you want protection? Oh, no! Don't protect me. Throw me in jail. Do your job! Oh, stop talking about work. I knew it was dangerous to use you. But I didn't think you'd go this far. Really? So I should've got myself killed? You had to wait to be alone before calling me. Not get caught so stupidly. Listen. Cristiani knows you saw it all. If you're arrested, it's all fucked. You know he'll deny everything. - Such a scandal. - There were lots of witnesses. No. Not even one. - The investigation says it's just you. - Those bastards! The only thing that you can do is to disappear and wait for a call. Oh really! Because you think he'll leave me alone? - Yes. - Yes?! Well, it's in his best interest. How many of you were there to decide this? Listen, we can't do anything for you, you are too dangerous. What if I spill it all out to the newspapers? What newspapers? Those who are against Cristiani. No, you can't ever prove you worked for us. The newspapers are very careful right now, you know. Okay, fine. Go. Fuck off! And get out! - Okay. - Yes. Just lie low for a while, it's for the better. Lie low? Lie low where?! - Where?! - That is your problem. Bastard! Everyone is in their places during the first sentence. So, "It was you, my dear father. With your soul, you saved the savages stricken with immense fury. I beg you, appease them!" Get up on that line. "Oh, how I suffered, with those I watched suffer." "Oh, how I suffered, with those I watched suffer." And come down the stairs in a light jog. Err. And you arrive next to Clement, at the end of the scene. "A vessel that, without a doubt, carried noble creatures, broken in pieces." Oh very nice, now you fall down at Prosperou's feet. "Their crime struck straight to the heart." Wait, now you turn to face the audience. This is for you, you see the storm again. "The poor souls have perished." Err, oh! Shit. I can't do it! Well, it's simple. Don't you understand the text or what? I don't know. So? Come on. - Who is that guy? - Why? Is there someone here? Police. I'd like to speak to Miss Cristiani. What do you want? It's private. So? I'm not a cop. I'm a lawyer. Really? I'm a lawyer defending a client accused of murder. I don't see what this has to do with me. Ah, there is no link. There is no link to you. No, err. I wanted to ask if you could give me details of the circumstances around your brother's death. Are you crazy or what? The guy that was murdered was in charge of your father's electoral posters. Okay, that's enough. I don't know what you're looking for. But I suggest that you go do your dirty work elsewhere. I was sure that you'd respond this way. - Ah! - And you are right, it's normal. It's true, I do dirty work. You are going to make me cry if you carry on. Okay, please excuse me. Sorry. I'll go, I'm sorry again. That's right, goodbye. "I'm really a lawyer. I don't want to make a scene. It's not about money. Etcetera." "If you'd like to help, I'm over by the railings. If not, my apologies again." Little idiot! Are you okay? I'm okay. I am sorry for earlier. But you really annoyed me with your stories. Yes, sorry, no harm done. So? - What do you want to know exactly? - I don't really know. No, actually there is the stuff about that guy. You know, the guy who was killed that night. That night when... You know, the guy that was in charge of your father's electoral posters. He died on the night of your brother's accident. Yeah. And err, I don't know, I've questioned lots of people. No one wants to give me an answer. Listen, it's simple. You should just go see my father. I tried to see your father, but he didn't want to see me. Tell me. What does my brother have to do with this? No, I want to ask a specific question. When was the last time you saw your brother? - Aren't you going with your sister? - I have a sports night. Sports night? Where? Young women are forbidden to come. A couple of hours before his accident. He was meant to accompany me here. But he was unable to because he had to go to a sports meet-up. Sports at night? Why not? And you don't know who he was meeting? Either way, he was alone at the time of the accident. The car missed the turn and it then caught fire, right? Right? - Is that correct? - Yes, that's correct! - I know it's... - No, you know nothing! You're making things up! - But I haven't made anything up. - That's even worse, you just keep talking! Yes? I was surprised to not have seen you. I was wondering if you'd come home. I've just got in. I was expecting you for a tea. It's six, you know? I didn't want to bother you. Days seem longer when I don't see you. And our tea-times are sacred. Am I bothering you? No, dad. Juliette. Juliette. Hmm? You can't stop yourself from thinking of him. And you, dad? Can you? I can't quite believe it, but we have to help your mother. She's hiding it, but she's hurting. Really hurting. You know, this afternoon a lawyer came to the theater to see me. A lawyer? Which lawyer? A certain Laubray. Jean-Pierre Laubray. Jean-Pierre Laubray, you say? I don't know him. What did he want? Well, he had tried to speak with you, but you wouldn't see him. You know these days I don't have the time. But why did he come to see you of all people? I don't know. He wanted information and as he wasn't able to see you... Information about what? Ha! The audacity! Going to see my daughter so that she deals with him. I'm going to get him fired! And quickly. Sorry, I don't know what's come over me, I got carried away. I just don't want people to bother you. If only you knew how tired I am. It sometimes feels like I'm a thousand years old. - Dad? - Yes. How did Bruno die? - Little one, you know how. - No, I don't! Is this a knuckle-duster? Yes. I never go snooping through your stuff. That is how I love you. Leave all this to your old man. Firstly, you're not old. And I want to know what happened to my brother. A man died the same night as Bruno. He was part of the team putting up your campaign posters. What are you talking about? That's exactly what I want to know. You're stood there all rigid. Don't you want to sit? I'm not tired. What in the world did that guy tell you? I don't believe you anymore. I don't trust you anymore. It's over. One day you'll see how hard all this is. Juliette, I just want to protect you. - Even if I didn't ask for it? - Especially, if you don't. Listen Juliette, you have all a girl could want. Even your theater stuff with people whose ways I don't often approve of. I don't want to get in the way of what you love. That said, I alone am the judge of my actions. And you, my daughter, have to trust me. Dad, please. Spare me your speeches. It sounds like a script. You're a great speaker. You're a cultivated man. You're my father, but I want to know certain things, and I will find them out. It's important to me. Shame on us both if you don't understand that. All this is ridiculous, really. - It's nice of you to have come so quickly. - You call so rarely. That's an odd place to meet, you know. The stuff with your brother, it must be awful. Yes. I feel really lonely now. - Why do you say that? - Because it's true. Does that surprise you? Do you think I'm trying to imply something? No, not at all. Listen. Listen to me. I'll do all I can to ease your sadness. You know what you mean to me. Yes. You proved that to me when I was quite young. Maybe we're old enough to talk about it now? - We could clear things up between us? - You?! You, clarify things? You know, every time I think about it, I feel like I was such a jerk. It's true that it screwed me up pretty badly. We were apart for a while. I was crazy, I think. And you were already so grown up that... I was 14, right? You still hold it against me? No. No, I really don't. I'm not angry at you. That said, I felt and still feel embarrassment towards you and your father. - Oh, but you know I never said anything? - Oh I know, I know. I trust your loyalty. Yeah. It's crazy how loyal we can be as a family. We say enough to not really say anything. But we actually understand everything. We have to stay silent. About Bruno's death, for example. - What about Bruno's death? - You know, don't bother yourself. I know. - I know you were there. - Who told you that? Dad. There was nothing I could do. That's what he said. But I just can't believe it. You know how impulsive Bruno was. He was the restless type. I know. But still. - It all happened so quickly that... - Tell me, Jean. Tell me the story in detail. No. - If your father learns that I told you... - Oh, I won't tell him. But I have to understand. I have to understand why! - No, I don't think so. - What do you think you know? I don't know! Jean, what do you know?! You can drive faster, the others will arrive on the other side. And don't forget. As soon as he gets to the others, go full headlights. Come on, stop! Bruno! Bruno! Stop! Bruno! Bruno, stop! Get away from here! Bruno! Bruno! - Let go of me! - Stop! Bruno! Stop. Look how he's looking at us. Okay, let's split up. We're going to go meet the contact at 3:00 a.m., bye! Your father won't be happy if the guy dies. Shut up. I just gave him a good beating. Really? Not the first time I've seen someone in that state. He's gonna die. And so what? My father is prepared to take that risk. So close to the elections? That's surprising. Okay, enough now. - If everyone keeps quiet, it'll be fine. - I should've killed the others for that. They don't know who we are. And in the dark... What the fuck are they doing? I hope they haven't had any troubles. I'm going for a piss. Hello, yes, can I speak to Inspector Decan. Come here, you! I thought you were a cop! I'm gonna kill you. Hello. Oh, hello! How are you? It'd be good if there wasn't school. It's repulsive, it's only kids who do the work. You don't like school? No, I do like it. But I'd prefer to do a job like yours, to wander around. You're right, it's more fun. How's your investigation going? Nowhere. We can speak less formally, you know. I'd rather not. Okay. Have you had a lot of criminals arrested? No. That's not what I do. The guy who kidnapped me, was he a gangster or a criminal? He wasn't really a gangster or a criminal, but he was dangerous. You must have been scared. No, not really. Still, he did have a revolver. You didn't see if he had bullets in his revolver? I don't know. Okay. Well, goodbye Marie. I have to go. Will you come back to see me? Because my grandmother doesn't want me to read the newspapers. If I learn something new, I'll come and tell you. - Bye. - Bye. Good evening Mr. Laubray. Two people are waiting for you up there. Oh, really? Come on, we've been waiting for him for two hours. Just leave him a note. I want to see him. It's him. Well, it's about time! Are you the lawyer? Thrilled to meet you. I'm Simone's cousin. - Pleasure. - That's not my cousin. He's a friend. What are you doing here? You didn't escape, did you? They let me go. Really? The police work hard, yeah? I don't work for the police. Ah, really. It's best not to try to understand what goes through their heads. They gave me this. They'll send you one too. I haven't seen that. Lack of evidence? But there never was any evidence. What's gotten into them suddenly? For once they have done a good job. So don't be annoyed with them. Especially since she's innocent. They didn't give you anything else? - No. - Don't worry yourself. There will be more work for you. There are lots of guilty people. Come on, let's go. Excuse us. I have an important meeting. She wanted to see you before leaving. Goodbye. Where can I reach you if I need to? My name and number are on the back of the envelope. - You don't have a phone number? - No, but my mother does. - Come inside, please. It's cold! - Coming. Good evening. I got the doors mixed up. I misunderstood what the lady downstairs told me. No, you were right. I live here. No, because... I was just in the area. I could have called. Am I not disturbing you? No, not at all. Come in. We're going to wake everyone. Please take a seat. Would you like anything to drink? No, thank you. I'm not thirsty. I was just putting away my files. The case is closed. Did you find anything? Err... No. They let my client go. They released her today due to lack of evidence. There's something I don't understand in all of this. What do you have? - What do you mean? I don't have anything. - Then why look at me like that? Were you aware they let Simone Ild go? Me? Why would I know? I don't know. I'm just asking. I love my father a lot. That's good. Of course. What do you mean, "of course"? It's not easy, you know? - I know it's not easy for me... - I said that about my dad, not you. You're driving me mad. Do you think that...? Ugh. Never mind. What's going on? Why so aggressive? Listen. You never leave me alone. You came to see me at the theater. - I've left you alone. - No you didn't! You came to the theater and told me some crazy stuff about my father and brother. - You force me to look into people's lives. - No, I didn't. - Stop pretending you're a judge. - I'm not pretending to be a judge! What are you talking about? I'm speaking about you! You appear in people's lives, look into their personal stuff and scare them. You leave your card and we are left to figure things out alone. Hey, hey! Stop talking so loudly! - Because everything... - Damn it! I'm leaving. Damn it. My keys! I don't have my keys, I'm locked out! You don't give a fuck?! Bitch! It's still open, Mr. Laubray. No need to get so worked up. Juliette? Juliette? You shouldn't have bothered, dad. I told mom I won't go and I haven't changed my mind. Listen, I have no intention of imposing anything at all. But you promised. That was before. Before what? Why didn't you come home last night? I went ten times to check your room. In any case, you're lucky you didn't catch a cold. Meme lent me her sleeping bag. Oh yes, of course. Theater. Already in Couteau's time the troupe lived together. They never left their theater. Those studies served you well. This has nothing to do with the theater. And you know it! Now dad, go away. - Please leave me be. - Honestly, Juliette. You're mad! Fine, I won't pester you any more with this inauguration. I thought it would make you happy as we'd announced your attendance. - Picture perfect French family!? - Listen! Juliette! I beg you! No crudeness. You seem tired. You should go rest a little. Come back to us in a better state. I don't want it. I don't ever want anything. - Mr. Cristiani? - You again?! Leave me alone! You know who I am? Not a word to my wife. Oh, what do you want? "Me again." I want nothing. I'm well thank you. I had heard of people who throw money out windows. I didn't know they actually existed. And now, thanks to you, that myth becomes a reality. I'm happy for you. You really don't want this money? Do with it what you like. Okay. Well, thank you, I'll keep it. I like money. Ugh. Do you think you're going to change the social order by throwing money out the windows? My life is my business. It's my problem. "My life is my business. It's my problem. So I throw money out the windows." "I spit in my dad's face who comes to spoil me even here." Really? Apologies, I wasn't thinking. It's not that. It's my brother. He was killed by your guy. My father tried to make it look like a car accident. Is that what you came to tell me yesterday? I couldn't. I won't ever say anything again. I think it's my father. Hooray!! - Hello, Mr. Laubray. - Hello. I'd told I'd come if there were any developments. So here I am. - What did you discover? - Nothing. - They let my client go. - And? For me it's over. - You don't need to look for the culprit? - No. They don't need me anymore. That's normal. - So who's going to find him? - The police. The police will continue their investigation. The police? Is that who came before you? Yes. Why do you ask? Because they never came back to see me. Most likely because they had what they needed. But you came back to see me? The previous time was a coincidence and this time is because I promised. So we won't see each other again? I live far from here, you know. And the people? - The police officers? - Yes. What are they going to do now? As I said, they will continue to search for the culprit. - So they will come back to see me? - Well no, since you told them everything. You told them everything, Marie? Yes? Yes, like I told you. See. Okay. Work hard in school, Marie. Okay. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Laubray! - Everyone saw you there. - Ah! Aren't you annoying. Ugh! It wasn't me who came looking for you. Okay, come on. Go! Come on, go! Give me that! Oh, you're really annoying, aren't you. - Please forgive me. - Get lost. Can I do anything to help? Yes, leave. You're not going to die, are you? Please will you just leave. Cristiani is over! Cristiani, it's no longer working! Stop the thief! Why are they rioting? It's nothing. It's an old story. Of course, I will be in touch. It's absurd to find ourselves in this situation. Don't get your hands too dirty. Seeing as this afternoon you knew who I was, I won't introduce myself. Gentlemen, that's enough. Thank you. Can you hear them? And they don't know the half of it yet. I know the truth about your son. I know that he bet a young man to death who didn't share your political views. I know he didn't die in a car crash. But that he was taken down by an informant. If you think freeing Simone will stop me, you are completely wrong. I'll go to the very end. I'll bring the scandal to light. I'm meeting with the Attorney General tomorrow. - I would like to warn you that... - Blackmail now? Do you think you're in Chicago? We are in France, with civilized people. I don't know who you are calling "civilized" and I'm not sure I'm one of them. Honestly, I'm asking myself that too. Your chauffeur is waiting for you in front of the entrance. We can leave. You think that this way we will be left alone? I hope so. The car must be here. Ah, yes. Big asshole. Interesting speeches. Thanks, dear friend. Let's go home. I have something else to tell you, Mr. Cristiani. Ravier was killed by a little girl. The girl he kidnapped. It was an accident. It's good news, isn't it? The little girl? As I live and breathe. You seem really surprised. - I didn't imagine a young girl could... - Mhm. What did you imagine then? You shouldn't let children play with guns. Either way, it's nice of you to always stick by your little old husband. Good evening, Mr. Laubray. Good evening, Mrs. Monique. I saw you looking for me. I was at the square. I hid. What did you tell my father? Everything. - What do you mean everything? - Everything I know. I also mentioned the meeting with the Attorney General. Why? I had no choice. Yes, you had a choice. Precisely that, you did have a choice. You know very well it would have been better not to. Better for who? For you. By seeing my father, you've given him all the arguments to prepare his defense. But you know that. And that's what you want. Want what? To screw everything up. Putting someone in check feels good, eh? It's so much easier. It's more enjoyable to do the wrong thing. To find yourself in this little boarding house, to sit down, and continue hating everyone, in peace. Is that right? Huh? Is that it? And me? Me? Huh? You don't hate me. Am I bothering you? It's not convenient, is it? No, it's not convenient at all. I miss Bruno. My dear friend. I'm exhausted. Now is not a good time. Ha! The time comes and they dispose of you without asking your opinion. I am here, a bit disgusted by myself. Why? Yes, "why?" Ah. And that Laubray is killing me. Is it really that serious? Very. I heard more or less what that young man said to you. You didn't actually learn much from him. It's not easy to talk about it with you. Now... can you? Tell me, Paul. I'm afraid that you will doubt me and my love for Bruno. Do you think I could doubt you? It was him who asked me to start for election. Monitoring the billboards entertained him. In theory, he wasn't at risk at all. Also, that night I stayed downstairs. I was working peacefully. What's wrong my boy? - Good evening, sir. - Hello. There was nothing I could do. It's Bruno. Dad? What are you doing here? - What's wrong? - Nothing. Nothing, sweetheart. What are you doing, shouldn't you be lying down? Come now, come on. Go to bed. What in the world? At this hour! I have work. It was strange you know, the wait, all day in that place. I had flashbacks of Bruno at every age. When I saw the man who killed him, I felt nothing. Nothing. He had nothing to do with Bruno. No link. You're sure no one saw you leave? One can never be certain. What a godsend for my enemies if they find out. But since it's the child that killed him and she admitted it... They wouldn't believe that. That I could be in contact with a man like Ravier and that I wouldn't get dirty. I can see only one solution to this. What? Beat Laubray to the punch. Juliette won't ever forgive me, right? Shh. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for coming to this press conference called so hastily. I would like to thank the Attorney General for allowing us to host it in his office. I have chosen today to make an open confession about a horrible nightmare. One that haunts every waking moment of my existence. Admitting a wrongdoing is not enough to make it disappear. It won't ever leave me, I know. What I hope for is to break this awful solitude understood by husbands wanting to protect their wives, and fathers, attentively wanting to protect their children. Every man is alone in the face of the decisions he has to make. To deny him his responsibility is to take his dignity away from him. However, the vocation of a politician extends and opens that responsibility to his professional life. This means accepting being held to the highest standards. And even demand to be held to account daily. Camera two. And if it is easy to be ruthless with oneself, how can you be with others? With your loved ones? Camera one. With this very spirit that walks by your side and without whom you would not find the courage to carry on. When, in the middle of the night, awoken from my sleep, I found out what happened to my son, I understood the rest. Yes, everything began with a quarrel between two young people, as we have all experienced in our youth. This one had a tragic ending. One of the boys fell and hit his head against the edge of the sidewalk. He died. An innocent young man died... tragically. It's absurd. Cruel. Revolting. As are all accidents. The person with whom we was fighting was my son. Bruno. A father can easily put himself in his son's shoes. You had become an assassin. You didn't understand anything anymore, my Bruno. The man, who in turn, a little later, killed my son, did it inadvertently, without a reason. It's actually Bruno who went looking for it. At first glance it was Bruno who deliberately provoked his own death. Camera two. How could I throw my wife into... this hell. This is what I have to admit to. What I must confess. When I found myself face to face with her I did not have the courage to tell her, so I said, "Bruno just had a car accident. He is dead." I want to pay homage to a man, who helped me decide to do what I am doing today. It's thanks to him that I understood what Bruno was asking of me in his death, that nothing and no one should come before the truth. Mr. Laubray. Please. Explain yourself. Mr. Laubray, you have the floor. Are you filming? Am I live? Eh? What should I do, should I stop it? No continue. But we are live? Cristiani knows exactly what he's doing. Camera one. Mr. Cristiani. Mr. Cristiani, you are very strong. I am your unwilling hero of the day. And you hope to put me in your pocket. Please go ahead, explain yourself. You've got the right to speak. - Regardless of what you might say. - You've even put make up on. Mr. Cristiani, your son accidentally killed a man. Mhm. Accidentally, but somewhat premeditatedly. It was bludgeoning, wasn't it? - I don't know, I wasn't there. - Mr. Laubray, who are your sources? - I think you've been duped. - No, I wasn't there. Mr. Cristiani, I wasn't there. I'm not contesting it. You might be right. Your son was killed a couple hours later. Perhaps, it was almost a kind of suicide. But I would like you to respond to a question. Did you try to disguise these two murders with a car accident? I'm asking you a question. Respond. Either to protect your wife, as you said, or to protect your political career. - Respond, Mr. Cristiani. - I don't understand, please explain. I don't understand. You've nailed the technique of keeping your cool and showing dignified pain. It's terrible. One never ceases to discover consequences of ones actions. Mr. Cristiani, you don't want to respond to my question. You concealed these two murders to protect your political career. To protect your political career, Mr. Cristiani! My dear friend, one doesn't protect their political career by concealing the death of a child. You are truly admirable, Mr. Cristiani. I have nothing left to say. I have nothing left to say. How are you doing? Very well, thank you. Are you a close friend of Mr. Cristiani? - Yes. - Yes. I wouldn't be here otherwise. Well. - Have a good rest of the day. - You too. Thank you gentlemen. Everything will now fall into place. He must know that I am thankful to him. That he has nothing to blame himself for. I am ready to own up to the anxiety he experienced in my presence. Don't worry about it. I won't say anything, don't worry. It won't result in anything. Subtitle translation by: Naomi Brown
