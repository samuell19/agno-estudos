[suspenseful music] KATE [VOICEOVER]: I grew up on the banks of this river. Beautiful and tranquil. This place is full of memories, some good and some that have broken my heart. I used to watch the sun glisten off of the river's glassy surface. And the water looked like a calm and soothing dream. But just below the surface, the river was dark, scary, and had the power to take life as easily as it could give it. My life also had two very different suns. Things weren't always as serene and peaceful as they appeared on the surface. And this river was more powerful than I could ever understand. It gave me the chance to experience a part of my life that had been taken away from me. I have two stories to tell, and two important men in my world-- Paul, the love of my life, and David, my best friend, a friend who was always there for me. These are my stories. [factory machine sounds] Hey. Hey. It came. What came? OK, you better give it to me now, or we're never having sex again. Come on. I'm in. Oh! I cannot believe I got into med school. Oh, I believe it. I can quit my job eventually, right? How's it feel? Feels good. Sometimes there's nothing worse than when your dreams come true. [phone ringing] Well, Kate, there's nothing wrong with you. You're in perfect health. And you're pregnant. Kate, you want to come in for a second? OK, so, um, just hear me out on this, all right? I was thinking, you see this area over here, right? Yeah, perfect place for a crib. And you know, over here, I don't know, we could put like a change table, chest of drawers, toy chest, you know, whatever we need. I mean, this could be the perfect place. Lots of light, plenty of room to play. And you know, we got this teddy bear. Hey, come here. Look, I know this isn't what we planned, and, uh, I know the timing couldn't be worse, but Kate, we can do this. I know we can. Marry me. You have no idea how many times I've dreamed about this, you know, you, me, a family of our own. But not like this. Not now. I mean, eight years I've been saving, you know, and going to night school, and working in a job that I can't stand. And now, when I finally have a chance-- So quit. It's not like I make minimum wage. What about school? Push it back a couple of years. Big deal. Push it back? Right. What, you think you're the only woman that ever went to school that had a baby? OK, we are talking about med school, Paul. How am I going to watch after a kid? I mean, who's going to look after him? What, you? - Why not? On your schedule? This wasn't the plan, Paul. Do you realize what you're talking about? Yes. So I don't have any say in this? Is that it? I don't believe this. I don't believe this is happening. Oh, this is going to solve things. Where you going? Where you going? I asked you a question. Where you going? Get out of my way. Just get out of my way. You want to act like a child, go ahead. [dramatic music] KATE [VOICEOVER]: I didn't know where I was going. I just needed to get away from Paul. I wasn't ready to be a mother. Not yet. I just needed to get away. I was on the road for a couple of days, but I realized that Paul was right. I was acting like a child. I needed to return home to work things out with him. [police and fire sirens] [fast music] Gabby. Gabby, what happened? Ray! Ray! Where's my husband? - Ray? He's hurt. - Where's Ray? - I don't know how badly. - Where is he? He's right over here. Oh, my god! Ray! Ray. Oh, my god. Ray. Ray! Bob. Bob, there's someone still inside. Yeah, there is. What I want to know is, what the hell is he doing in there? What? It's Paul, Kate. The only one inside is Paul. And there's no way to get him out. How you doing, Katie? I've had better days. A day like today, it would have been kind of nice having mom here. Um, look, you go, OK? I'll be-- I'll be fine. I don't mind staying. Um, really, I'll be all right. You sure? You need me, I'm right next door. [phone ringing] Yeah? It's David. Mm-hmm. Yeah, she's-- she's OK. Listen, her boyfriend just died today. Can't it wait? Look, I'll call you in the morning, all right? I'll let you know when she's ready. Who was that? Sheriff's Department. What did they want? It's Ray. He's saying that, uh, Paul set the fire on purpose. That's-- that's ridiculous. I agree, but that's what he's saying. Look, is there something you need to tell me? [suspenseful music] KATE [VOICEOVER]: I don't know who started that fire, but I know it wasn't Paul. [soft music] [knocking on door] Hey. How you doing? She's beautiful, Katie. Her name is Meghan. Takes after Paul a little bit, don't you think? What do you think, sweet girl? It's just you and me. [baby making sounds] I know. Do you think we can do it? [baby making sounds] But I think we can make it. [strident music] So what do you want to tell me about? Your boyfriend? I don't have a boyfriend. Yeah? You don't have one? - No. Are you sure? I'm sure, I'm sure. Would you tell me if you did have one? - Nope. - No? See? So maybe you do have one. I do not have one. I like boys, but I don't have a boyfriend. - Hey! - Hey. Hey, mom. Hey, beautiful. Hey, what are you doing? Hi. DAVID: Hi. What is that on your arm? A tattoo. A tattoo of what? A motorcycle. A Chief, to be the specific. It's a classic. David, I appreciate you babysitting, but is it me, or is that a little weird for a four-year-old? Well, what you call weird, others might call interesting. Aha. Well, take a look at this. What is it? I got in to the accounting program. And this is a good thing? What do you mean? You're OK with this? Why wouldn't I be? Well, it's not exactly a career in medicine. KATE: Right. Like that's going to happen OK, so maybe med school's out, but I mean, nursing or something? Do you some kind of a problem with accountants that we don't know about? No. Just doesn't seem like you, does it? It's not really about me, is it? Will you do me a favor? Mm-hmm. Go up to the house, wash your hands. Thank you. Get. What are you so on my case for? I'm not. Yeah, you are, David. I mean, don't you think that I'm trying? Don't you think I'm doing the best that I can? That's not what I'm saying. Then, what are you saying? Look, just relax, all right? It's just some dreams die hard, you know? What about your dream? I mean, what have you done that is so amazing? And you're supposed to be this great artist, and look at you. You paint houses for a living. What happened to your great career? I'm sorry. I didn't-- No, it's OK. Don't apologize. The fact is, you're right. You're absolutely right. [sad music] Come on, that's all talk. All right, Mr. Poopy is done pooping. You can have him now. You take Mr.-- No, you keep him. [kissing sound] And I'll take Mr. Poopy. Eskimo. Go to bed. [soft music] Wow. It's for her birthday. You are going to make one little girl very, very happy. Got a buddy of mine in Chicago who's been asking me to move there. I think I'm gonna go. Do you think that, you know, we might be overreacting just a little bit? Let's not play games, OK? We both know this day's been coming. I want you to come with me. What did you think I was going to do, Kate, just sit around waiting forever? Don't be mad. Is that what you think this is? You think I'm mad at you? Yep. David was moving on with his life without me. And I couldn't stop thinking about Paul. [sad music] Gabby, Paul's headstone was vandalized again. You wouldn't happen to know anything about that, would you? No. Really? You know something, Kate, a lot of people lost their jobs that day, and my husband's health was destroyed. People ask, and I tell them Paul started the fire. You don't like it, find another place to live. Go to hell. Gabby, can we please just go now? I'd just like to go home now, OK? Hey, be careful. You shouldn't listen to people like that, Katie. Don't let her get to you. Right. So then what am I supposed to do? I mean, what do I end up telling Meghan? Maybe she's right, the time has come to move on. So maybe you should. Why don't you come with me? I meant what I said. I'm done here. I'm gone. I'm serious. Maybe this is just what we need, you know? Get out of town, start someplace new. Maybe-- maybe it'd give you and me a chance. See what happens. I want you to come with me, Katie. [soft music] I'm sorry. Don't say anything. I mean, what's to say, anyway? You know what kills me, though? I never forgot what you said to me that day we went out to Portage Grove. Where? Portage Grove, remember? We were looking for Paul the day he died. No, I was on the road driving all day. What are you talking about? You were with me. No, I wasn't. [eerie music] So I guess it must have been somebody else who gave me this. How did you get that? You gave it to me, remember? When I asked you what it was-- No, that's impossible, all right? Because it's one of a kind, and I made it with Meghan in craft class last week. [water splash] MEGHAN: Mommy! Meghan! Mommy! KATE: Meghan! Mommy, help! [dramatic music] MEGHAN [VOICEOVER]: Help! Mommy, help! [sad music] [eerie music] Kate. Meghan, she's still-- Kate, just lay still. Hey, hey, get over here, man. Are you OK? Just lie back, OK? Take deep breaths. Just lay still, Kate. How did this happen? Just relax. Get an ambulance. Get an ambulance! Kate. Kate, you all right? MEGHAN [VOICEOVER]: Mommy! Meghan. David! What? Where is she? Who? Meghan. What do you mean? Is she OK? I don't understand, Katie. Just-- Oh, god. Just calm down, OK? Don't you remember, Katie? She died. Your mother died two years ago, Katie. I am not talking about my mother. Well, who are you talking about? I'm talking about my baby, Meghan. No way None of this is happening. What's wrong? Hey, come here. Kate. Just-- just give her a minute, Paul. Wait just a minute. What day is it? It's Friday. No, what's the date? 12th. Of? May. What year? What year? Well, the doctor said she and the baby are going to be all right. The hypothermia put her into shock, and then post-shock syndrome. I see it a lot. She tell you what the hell happened? She wouldn't look at me. I'm not looking that bad, am I? No worse than usual. So let me ask you something. Shoot. You've known her since pre-school. She ever act like this? All the time. You'll get used to it. - You think so? Well, you better. You live with her, right? All right, I'm going to get back. Good luck. [light music] Stop! [suspenseful music] Where you going? I'm looking for someone. Who? You. I'm over here. Are you all right? You know, there's one more place I want to check out. What do you see? What do you mean? I mean, what do you see? Well, I see the river and the town, obviously. What do you see in the town? I see the docks, the factory. Yeah, the factory. I have no idea what's going on. Come on, Kate. There's somewhere I want to show you. [soft music] It's a cool place, huh? Love it. I'm a lucky man, Kate, you know? Money may not be the greatest, but I got the best job going, as far as I'm concerned. And you know I'd do it for free. And I want you to feel the same way about what you do. I know how hard you worked for the scholarship. I know what it means to you, and I was wrong to ask you to put it off. I don't want you to. I want to have this baby, and I'm willing to make some changes, but I'll support you in whatever you decide to do. OK? I'm sorry about the fight. I'm sorry, too. [birds chirping] [eerie music] What's wrong? Hey, what's wrong? [sad music] MEGHAN [VOICEOVER]: Mommy! Mommy! [sad music] Kate? [soft music] Those for me? So is your offer still good? That day in the sunroom, you asked me to marry you. Well, the answer is yes. I want to marry you, Paul. Today. I called Reverend James and he agreed to perform the service. He can be here in 10 minutes. No, no, no, what-- what I meant was I don't understand why today. What's the rush? Everything changes. OK, everything is going to be different from here on out. What are you talking about? Just trust me, OK? Honey, I to trust you. I trust you with my life, but I don't want to do it like this. You know, not until you tell me what's going on. You're going to die. If we stay in this town, you are going to die. Tomorrow at the factory, there's going to be a fire. What are you talking about? I was there. I saw it with my own eyes. It hasn't happened yet, but you were there? It was five years ago. Five years ago tomorrow, you died in a fire at the factory. But we're going to change that. You're not going to be there. Is this a joke? What do you think, Paul? I mean, do you think that I just woke up this morning and thought, hey, I know, I'll just pretend that I'm from the future-- yeah, that sounds like fun? Look, I know that this sounds crazy-- What do you expect from me? What do you want me to say? I believe you? No. Just stay with me. Is that too much to ask? [soft music] Hey, guys. How's it going? How you feeling? Um, better. Thanks. Hey, you guys hungry? We got food. - I could eat. - All right. Great. Burgers, hot dog? [soft music] Can I get you anything? Something to drink? - Um no. But I do have one question. What-- what is it? That? You mean I need to spoon feed you? Doesn't that kind of negate the whole purpose of art? You have absolutely no idea what it is, do you? Let's just call it a work in progress. Oh, OK. You OK? Uh, yeah, I'm fine. I mean, I'm only asking because, hey, it's not every day they find you lying out in the middle of the road half dead, you know? You want to tell me what's going on? Sure, why not? What if I told you that I've seen the future, that I've lived there? Well, first, I'd probably say something like, whoa, that's some serious weed you're smoking there, girl. And then, knowing me, I'd probably say something like, can I have some, please? So what's going on with you two? Well, what can I say, Katie, a man's got needs. Oh. Well, you might want to be careful. I have a feeling this girl's in love. What? I don't suppose I could get you to tell her I'm moving, then, could I? What are you talking about? Couple of friends of mine from school found this great loft in Chicago. Guess the rent's pretty cheap. Huge space, great light. Might as well try and find out if my stuff is really any good or not, right? [suspenseful music] What about your dreams? I mean, what have you done that is so amazing? And you're supposed to be this great artist, and look at you. You paint houses for a living. What happened to your great career? I'm sorry. I didn't-- No, it's OK. Don't apologize. Fact is, you're right. You're absolutely right. How come you never told me about this? I only decided a couple of days ago. [sad music] You never told me why it was so important to you. [crickets chirping] Why what so important? The baby, starting a family. [train whistle] It's not. Paul. Kate, it's not. Really. Please. Well, it's not something that I thought about a lot, you know? But when I found out you were pregnant, it just felt right. You know, it was like-- it was like it just-- it-- everything fell into place. Like I knew this person somehow, you know? Does that make sense? It's like I got this-- this empty space inside of me that's waiting for him. But I didn't even know it, you know? And what makes you so sure is that it's a boy? Well, that's just a feeling that I get. And what happens if it's a girl? Let's go to sleep. Just tell me. Do you think that I'll have a problem with that? Do you think that I wouldn't love her as much as I love you? [soft music] His name is Meghan. And the day she was born, I cried for you. I cried for you, for me, the baby that you would never know. And there I was, you know, holding this beautiful, precious child, and all I could think is that there's nothing that you wouldn't do, there's no price that you wouldn't pay, just to hold her. You have no idea how many times I've wanted to tell you about her, you know? Just to turn to you and say, wow, look, that's our daughter. We did this, you and me. And she's so tiny and innocent. And I have never felt so much love before. She thinks about you, you know? Really, she's starting to. She asks about you. I think that she's just beginning to sense that she's lost something, something that can't be replaced, something that she'll never know. And she's out there. And she's lost, and she's afraid, and she needs me, and I have no idea how to find her. Come on. That night, after our flight-- Kate, you don't have to. Just-- after our fight, I got in the car and I just started driving. You know, I didn't care where I was going as long as I was far away from here. I stopped and I turned around, and I came straight back. But it was too late. By the time I got here, the factory was on fire and you were trapped inside, and they said that you were dead. And then, there's Ray. He said that you started the fire. I started it? Yeah. He almost died that night. It's a miracle he's even alive, his lungs were burnt so bad. A lot of people's lives were destroyed that night. Yours, Ray's, mine. Paul, I'm not going to ask you to believe me. But what I am going to ask you to do is, tomorrow, no matter what happens, just stay away from the factory. Please. Fine. Sure. Paul? Uh, hey, have you seen Paul? Oh, I heard him pull out. Must have been what, a couple of hours ago? Oh, whenever it was, it was early. Everything OK? [fast music] Hey, Ian. Hey, gorgeous, what's up? Have you seen Paul? No, I'm sorry. I haven't. All right, well, he went out on his boat today, so if you see him, will you tell him that I'm looking for him? You bet. Thanks. Hey, Kate, is there a problem? No. [fast music] Hey, Burton, have you seen Paul? Your Paul? Nope. [soft music] No luck. You haven't heard from them either? Kate, what's going on? Um, it's been kind of a crazy time, David. Yeah, I pretty much figured that out all by myself. He just left. No note, nothing. Any other day, I wouldn't have a problem with this, but not today. [sad music] He's not answering. I'm sure there's nothing to worry about. So he needed some time to himself, so what? With all you guys have been going through, you can't blame him, can you? Yeah, you know there is one more place I'd like to check out, all right? I don't remember what it's called, but he took me there yesterday. It's a grove that sits on the river with these trees growing out of the water. Yeah, I think I know it. Portage Grove. It's like a couple hours from here. What did you say it was called? Portage Grove. Remember, we were looking for Paul. How do I get there? I know about the baby, Kate. Paul told me you don't know what you're going to do about keeping it. No, I am keeping her, all right? Her? Meghan. Her name is Meghan. What's this, some kind of women's intuition? Something like that. Meghan, huh? After your mom. I look forward to meeting her. Well, that's good, because the two of you are going to be the best of friends. Oh, yeah? Yeah. [fast music] Well, it was worth a shot, right? Do you believe in destiny? Can't say I've really given it much thought, but if you mean do I think the future's carved out in stone or something, the answer is no. What about the past? Was that some kind of trick question? OK, dying. You know, I mean, do you ever stop and think about all the things that you would miss if you died like tomorrow, or today? It's funny you should say that. I was just asking myself that same thing? Ugh. Forget it. Oh, come on! It's kind of a strange question, don't you think? Forget that I asked. I'm sure there's plenty of things I'd miss, like I'd never see the Cubbies win the World Series, for one thing. Mind you, I probably won't see that if I live to be 100. Right. You know, what just stop it. Of course, it wouldn't be all bad. There are some good things to be said for dying young, you know? Like what? Like I don't know, you don't have to put up with the telemarketing people calling you the moment you sit down for dinner. That's a definite plus. You know, this is just one big joke to you, isn't it? And you want to know why? Because you don't have a clue. All right, you have never lost anyone, and until you do-- OK, so I think now would be a good time for you to tell me what the hell is going on. Once-- just once, I would like to be able to ask you a real question and get a real answer. Just take me back. Did it ever occur to you that maybe, just maybe, you posed the question wrong? You want a real answer from me, Kate? Fine, here it is-- fact is, I couldn't give a damn what I'd miss if I die. OK? It's what I'll miss if I live I worry about. [soft music] Kate! Kate! [sad music] Um, I think that you're supposed to have this, that I'm supposed to give it to you. What are you talking about? I don't know. You never told me. [soft music] You were talking about me. The things that you'll miss if you live, you were talking about me. Why are you doing this? Why didn't you tell me? When we were kids, I always just figured that someday it'd be you and me, you know? I always thought that-- I don't know, one day, you'd see me and it'd just be right. Instead, along comes Paul, who blows into your world, sweeps you off your feet, and what can I say, the rest is history, right? You want to know the strangest thing about all this? I said I liked the guy. I really do. Fact is, I-- I'm really happy for you. OK, thanks. If you see her, just tell her that I'm looking for her. Yeah. So I'll see you later. Don't bother picking me up after work, OK? I won't be here. I'm gonna go stay at my sister's. What? Why? Come on, Ray, don't act so surprised. I don't understand. Gabby. Um, you know what, I think I'm gonna get out here. You don't want me to drop you at home? No, I'm fine. You sure? Don't sweat it, Katie. I bet he's already home. Look, David, I-- DAVID: You just worry about looking after yourself, all right? Right. You know, if you've ever wondered if it's possible to be in love with two people at the same time, the answer is yes. [sad music] Where have you been, man? Where's Kate? I dropped her off downtown. You dropped her off without a car? That's what she wanted me to do. At the factory? A few blocks away. Why? - Jeez, Ray. - What? Yeah, right. [sad music] [eerie music] Hello? [eerie music] [fast music] What the hell you doing here? Kate, you can't go in there! Kate, I'll take care of it! Kate! Kate! Get out of here! Come on. We have to call 911! Get out of here! Don't do that, Kate. This is my job. Just get the hell out of here. I'll take care of the fire. Just go! Kate! Katie, hey! Hey, hey, look at me. Are you OK? Come on, let's go. Let's get out of here, come on. [coughing] Paul. Oh, god. Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh, oh. [fast music] Kate, the sprinklers. We gotta get to the sprinklers. All right. Paul, we have to get out of here, OK? I know, I know, we have to go, though. Paul. Just-- just go. No, I'm not leaving here with you coming. Come on. [explosion] Paul! Get up! Shh! Hey, get out. Kate, go. I'm not leaving here without you, Paul. Please. Have I told you how much I love you? I tried to stop it. We have a little girl. We have a baby girl out there. Go find her. Go find her. Please, please, don't. No. Please, please, don't go yet. [sad music] No. No! Oh, god. [police and fire sirens] [suspenseful music] [eerie music] [wood breaking] Oh! [fast music] [eerie music] [soft music] Kate? Kate, what happened to you? Where is she? There are a lot of people looking for you. Where's Meghan? She's at home with David. They're safe. [MUSIC - FISHER, "I WILL LOVE YOU"] Til my body is dust, til my soul is no more, I will love you, love you. Til the sun starts to cry and the moon turns to rust, I will love you, love you. But I need to know will you stay for all time, forever and a day. Then I'll give my heart til the end of all time, forever and a day. [soft music] [suspenseful music] I know what happened. What took you so long? I want my daughter to know the truth. I thought you were dead. I thought you were both dead. I-- you know-- why didn't you say anything? I'd like to tell your daughter what really happened, Kate. I'd like that very much. [soft music] KATE [VOICEOVER]: Like the river that carried my life in two different directions, I ultimately arrived at my destiny-- a wonderful life with David and Meghan. I will always love Paul. And one day, I will be able to teach our daughter what I have learned. You can never change the past, but you can change the future. [music playing]
