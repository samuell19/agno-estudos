Oh, according to the Chinese horoscope I was born in the year of the tiger. You are a very lucky young man. Scott, how'd you do on your exam? You don't want to know Jesus Christ, Daniel. Guy lives on the phone. Madame moon: My dear friend, my name is madame moon. I am the woman you helped in the rain about six months ago. It took me a while to trace you. But I wanted you to have this small gift... Aaaagh! Mi amor! Mi amor! Assuncion! You scared me! Scare you? I love you, papi! Why don't you let me come up to your room anymore? We'll talk later, alright? He doesn't let me breathe! Reverend mortomon TV: "And I tell you my brothers..." Reverend mortom on TV: "And I tell you my sisters!" The devil is waitin'! The devil, the master of evil is waiting... Reverend mortom: To seduce you! Take a good look inside yourself, my friend, and you will find there's nothing there! There's nothing there! It's empty! The good lord has gone. In this weather he's probably taken off to get himself a cold beer. Sounds like a plan. Hey, want a beer? No, thanks. Here, take a look at that. It's a beauty. Damn, that's a lot of phone calls. Who's got the big mouth? Hey, Scott, you blew it, huh? Well, buddy, I didn't see you as an engineer anyway. You listening to me? Get off my back, ok? You wanna know something? Probably would have pulled it off if it hadn't been for that leg of yours. What's my busted leg got to do with your exam? What's it got to do with it? I didn't have time to study! I had to look after you, dress you, work your shifts on the rickshaw! Only thing I didn't do for you was wipe your ass. Right, so it's my fault. I can't help it you got shit for brains. I was breaking my neck to avoid that friggin' snake! Look, cut the bullshit. Everyone knows you were piss-ass drunk. I'm telling you, I saw a cobra crossing the street when I was running with the rickshaw. Yeah right. A cobra in coconut grove? Come on. Hey, make it a short call. The phone costs, you know? Mortom on TV: "My dear devoted followers..." "I am your humble servant.' "and the good lord..." "The good lord has guided you to follow me." "To support me!" "To obey me!" "You have made me rich and powerful..." "So that I can show you the glory of god." Halt! Let the reverend through! Step back! Thank you. God bless. God bless. That was a very nice meeting. I have a terrible migraine. You're probably tired, honey. I'll take you home. Reverend mortom, there's a phone call for you. Have whoever it is contact my secretary. It's on your mobile phone. It could be Jason. No, it couldn't. Take my wife home. I'll see you later, honey. Reverend mortom the package has arrived at its destination. Bring it here. Now. Hey, girls, wanna ride the American rickshaw? Where's Daniel? He's at home with his beers, phone, and broken leg. Bye! See ya later! Yeah. Hey, babe! Ride with me. Give you a discount. I'll carry you in my arms if you prefer! Hey, tiger. You wanna forget the book for a while? It's forgotten. Where we going? Biscayne harbor Well, here we are. Why don't you come in and catch your breath? No, I really should be getting back to work. It's too good a chance to miss. Come on. Take off your shoes. This isn't exactly the form of payment I was expecting. I'll pay you for the rickshaw ride too. What was that? What was what? That noise. I didn't hear anything. Oh god! You son of a bitch. Hey, Scott! What's the matter? The show must go on. What'd you say? Don't you rickshaw guys work for tips? Is a hundred bucks enough? Move! No, no! Don't take that one! No, don't take that one! Well, was she a hot babe? What? The little nympho. She got it up just by looking at me. Man, I've said it time and time again. You're a real putz! You get yourself a luxury lay, you pick up a neat hundred, and what do you do? You screw it up. Is that the guy? It's trashed. Wonder what he's saying about that key. If you ask me I think it's some kind of message. Yeah, but what message? This isn't even the right cassette! That son of a bitch rolled me the wrong one. So, where you going? I'm going back to the yacht. You think I want him jerking off to me? Why not? Everybody else does. What are you looking for? I thought I saw someone dive off the boat. Well, where is he? Over there, man. By the other boat. I'll radio in. I'm in deep shit, Daniel! The guys dead. My prints must be all over the place. Hey, if you didn't waste the creep, what are you worried about? I just told you, man! I'm busted! My prints! My blood! It's all over the boat! You just finished telling me the boat went up in flames, right? I'll go to the cops. I'm gonna tell them everything. What are you? Crazy? You think the cops are gonna believe you? No one knows you were on that yacht apart from the girl and you know she ain't about to go screaming to the cops. Let's just wait and see what the papers say. This is the only thing connecting you to the dead guy and we're gonna make it disappear. Well? We found a body. Victim of the fire? I don't think so, but it's all very suspicious. Who's the owner of the boat? Jason mortom, the son of that TV preacher reverend mortom. But the body hasn't been identified yet. It was burned to a cinder. Anybody else on board? Apparently, someone dived off the yacht during the fire, but our divers have come up with a big fat zilch. Could have been the killer. Mortom family been informed? They're doing it now. It's been a hell of a day. My horoscope said today was gonna be a bitch. Horoscope... Somebody got there before me. Yes, I know who it is. Relax, please. I'll get back to you. Hey, Scott, wake up. Hey, Scott! Wake up! Guess who the stiff was? Reverend mortom's son! The body was fried, but they could identify it because he has a thumb missing on one hand. You guys were born the same day. Isn't that something? He was born June 6th, 1966? Right! Come on. You can tell your old buddy, Daniel. You didn't want to share your birthday so you burned his ass. You killed him. Hey, Scott! Don't you say that! Don't ever say it again! Cut it out! You're strangling me! What are you, crazy? Madame moon voiceover: "My dear friend..." "My name is madame moon." "I am the woman you helped in the rain about six months ago..." Hi, Scott! Hey, the boss is really mad. He waited til a few minutes ago. It's a busy night tonight. Oh, yeah. This weird looking guy came by asking for you. For the guy with the tiger. What'd he want? Dunno. He wasn't gay. I woulda hung on to him otherwise. Hey! What's going on? Sir, would you like a ride? Sure. Take me downtown. You're Scott's friend, aren't you? When's he coming home? He won't be early. I can wait. Who are you? I ask the questions! I don't know nothin'! I think you're forgetting who's holding the aces here, pal. Want me to break your other leg? This little toy makes big holes without any noise. I had nothing to do with what Scott did. He didn't kill Jason mortom if that's what you want to know! How do you know that? I believe him. Aww, don't you make a cute couple. So why did he put the cassette in the oven? I did that. Scott took it off the guy who was filming him while he was doing the whore. They had a fight and Scott beat the hell out of the creep. And he took the wrong cassette. So he went back to the yacht to find the right one. And he found the body. Or maybe Scott killed him! Are you a cop? No, not quite. I'm the guy who wasted Jason mortom. I was looking for something on that yacht. But I didn't leave my business card. Your buddy did. And he got scared. That's why he burned the yacht. This is the cassette he was looking for. And this little baby would put his ass away for a long time. Maybe the tape in the oven is the one that I needed. But I can't watch it now. Thanks to you. I want you to tell me what you saw on the tape. And maybe we'll destroy it just like the other one. Who's to say you didn't duplicate it? Maybe I did. But you don't have a choice. You gotta trust me. What's on the cassette? The picture wasn't too good. It was like... it was making a confession or something. The guy was holding up a key he had hung around his neck. A key? Yeah, a key. To a safe or a safety deposit box or something like that. Anyways, that's all I saw. You see I kept my word. But I think your buddy knows where the key is. And I certainly hope he's going to be just as cooperative. And just as dumb. What happened? There was a fire in the apartment and the kid living there was murdered. What? This is the second body in two days involved in a fire. Poor bastard could tell us more than the last one. Have ballistics compare the bullet with the one that killed Jason mortom. Might have been fired from the same gun. That's strange. This dresser isn't even burned. Female officer: Lieutenant. So, who is this Scott Edwards? The kid who shared the apartment with the dead guy. They were both part-time rickshaw pullers in coconut grove. Where is he now? A woman saw him out in the street with the rest of the crowd and then he disappeared. Find him. Hey, lieutenant. Take a look at this. I doubt we'll get anything out of this. Well, it may just be a coincidence, but I heard that Jason mortom was a video freak. He liked to film sex. Are you kidding? Reverend mortom's son a peeping Tom? Hmm. Who are you? Let's just say I'm the... milk man. Take a walk. It's a shame about all those missing kids. You understand what I'm saying? Open the door. Who the hell do you think you are? Shut up! I kill for a lot less. Who's room is this? One of the girls I work with. She's working at the club right now. What do you want? You certainly look better in real life. What? I caught your video act with the rickshaw kid. You're quite an actress. Hey, look. What do you want? I had nothing to do with that pigs death. I want you to continue the act. I want you to tell the cops that the rickshaw kid wasted Jason mortom. Why? I'm looking for a certain key and I think he knows where it is. But the little prick's disappeared. So I figure after you point the finger at him, he's gonna come looking for you. But you can bet your sweet ass that I'm gonna get to him before the cops do. Reporter: What about the killer? Is he a maniac? Please. Reporter: Is it true there was an orgy on the yacht? Reporter: The girl accusing him, is she a prostitute? Oh, come on, guys. Is it true that the mortom murder is somehow connected to the Daniel Blake killing? Look, we're studying every piece of evidence that's coming in about this case. Ok? We'll get to you guys later. Reporter: Could it have been a sex maniac? We'll keep you informed as the investigation continues. Right now let us get back to work. The comfort and sympathy shown by you, my friends, friends of my church, will help my wife, Sarah, and myself to overcome the terrible tragedy of our son's death. Reporter: Reverend mortom, wait! What can you tell us about the investigation? What caused your son's death? Reverend mortom, is it true you and your son weren't on good terms? I've been told to make no statements at this time. Mrs. mortom, I realize this is a hard time for you but... However, I will make one declaration, I will make, I, I am quite certain that divine Providence will intervene to reveal the truth about, about the death of our son. Out of the way! Out of the way! Want me to read it to you? I'd like to sign it and go. Could be indicted for false testimony if you haven't told the truth. Read it. Check to see if everything is ok. I'm sure it's just fine. Look, I gave you guys the facts. I told you what I saw! The rickshaw kid killed him. If I hadn't gotten out of there when I did he would have killed me too! Where do I sign? Right here. Canl go? Yeah, sure. This way. You won't bump into the press. Inform us of your movements. We might have to talk to you again. Don't forget. How could I, lieutenant? Well, this wraps up the case. Now all you have to do is find the rickshaw kid. I think your horoscope for today says to think real hard before opening your mouth. Maybe. I haven't had time to read it yet. Reporteron TV: "Police are on the lookout for Scott Edwards. "A student and part-time rickshaw puller in coconut grove." "There is reason to believe that Edwards is also responsible for the death of Daniel Blake..." "With whom he worked and shared an apartment.” "The person accusing Edwards of killing Jason mortom..." "Is a young strip-tease artist named Joanna Simpson." Go away! No talk! No! Looks like that boy's in a lot of trouble... Are you finished for the day? Lucky you. I'll see you at home, Mary Jo. Yeah. What do you want? I wanna ask you a few questions, joanne. Come on. Let's go. Drive. I've got nothing to say to you. Get out or I'll scream. You scream, I swear to god, I'm gonna stick you with this thing, alright? I found it in the gutter. I'm sure you're familiar with aids! Let's go. Drive. Those are cops in that car. They'll follow us. Don't worry about it, alright? Let's just go. Drive. Come on! You fucking deaf? Let's go! Are the cops following us? No. Go to the top floor. Get out. We're changing cars. Would you let me explain? Explain what? That I'm in a shit-load of trouble thanks to you? Wait a minute. All I did was set you up in front of that mirror. I was paid to do it. The rest of this shit is your fault. Well, what the fuck was I supposed to do? Just go ahead and let that porno freak film my bare ass? They pay better. Didn't you know that? No, I didn't know that! That's not my game! What is your game? Killing people? I didn't kill anybody. You were there and you saw what happened. You beat him to death! I did not! The guy was alive when we left the yacht. I only told the police what I saw. Bullshit! The cops are saying you saw me kill the guy. Scott, careful. That guy's been looking for you. Take it easy, man. Come on! Don't stop! Go! Go! This is officer kowalsky. We've located the suspect's car. You're not leaving this place until you've told me everything I want to know. You're the one that got me into this shit. You got yourself into this shit. You're only making things worse. Now your'e a kidnapper, too? Who the hell was that guy that attacked me in the parking lot? A guy that knows everything that happened between you and Jason mortom. And who wants something only you can give him, seeing as how the other guy's dead. I didn't kill him. Sit down. Killing me with that gun would be really stupid. It already killed Jason mortom and probably your buddy too. I didn't kill Daniel either! He was my best friend, for Christ sakes! They'll pin three murders on you in a flash. I can't believe you went to the cops and told them all those lies about me. He forced me to! So that he could get to you. But you were smarter than he. And I helped you. Why did he force you? I mean, what does he want that only I have? Not now, baby. What? Come here. After I've taken a shower. Take it easy. You make a move and I might have you arrested for rape. I thought you hated me. I do. Joanna: He wants to get to you before the police do. Scott: Why? Joanna: He says you know what happened to a certain key. Scott: A key? Some key Jason mortom carried around with him? Oh, I remember. He had it on a chain around his neck. It broke off during the fight. I think I know where it is. Maybe the key will get you out of this mess if you turn it in to the police. What's wrong? It's nothing. I just haven't slept in three days. So sleep now. Can I trust you? Tie me to the bed. You're sure this was the guy that followed Edwards into the parking garage? Francis o'Connor. Multiple killer. Belongs to some fanatical religious sect. One of the few survivors of the mass suicide in Guyana in 1978 ok, I want a detailed report on the murders of Jason mortom and Daniel Blake. Anything that's weird and coincidental. K, guys? What have you got in mind? I'm not sure. Nothing fits. Nothing makes any sense. For example? The fires. The one in the yacht and the one in the apartment. I mean, things don't just burst into flames by themselves. There's not a trace of what set them off. What else? Scott edwardes. If you'd shot mortom in the yacht, would you go to your apartment then shoot your roommate with the same gun? No. But if the guy's a psycho... And don't forget about the girl. Her testimony is solid. Scott Edwards is considered a serious and hard working kid according to his university professors... And the rickshaw pullers. As far as the girl's concerned, I think she's hiding something. Hello? Joanna? I have to see you. Right now. Joanna. Where've you been? I phoned home to talk to my roommate. I didn't want to risk it from here. They could have put a tap on my phone. Sweetheart, if I was gonna screw you over, I had all night long to do it. Why don't you just put down that gun. It's not your style. What's this? I bought you these. The others were beginning to smell. Forget it. You'll never be able to find the key there. Look at the color of the water. Look, I gotta try. I know it's down here. What a beautiful cat! I wonder who it belongs to! Uh, don't touch it. It's only a cat. Hey. Huh? Snap out of it. This isn't just any cat. It belongs to some old Chinese lady. Look. It's like he's showing me exactly where to dive in. Can't find it! I guess that's it. Scott, let's go tell everything to the police. They've gotta believe us. No, I want to give it one more try. I found it! Joanna! Joanna! Mommy! Mommy! Oh, my baby! Never trust a whore. Give me the key. What key? 121 government center station. Thank you, my friend. This is a curious coincidence. Scott Edwards and Jason mortom were born on the same day. A day that includes four sixes. Of course! The sixth day of the sixth month of 1966. According to the Chinese calendar that is the high point of the year of the tiger. The day of maximum power. Information you won't find on your computer. If you like I can lend you my book on the Chinese horoscope. No thanks. Hello. It's Scott Edwards. This is lieutenant Morgan. Listen, lieutenant. I'm not your killer. I'm an innocent victim of a god damn conspiracy going on! Hello? Hello? Hello? Did you trace that call? Yes, lieutenant. It's a pay phone down at biscayne harbor. A cruiser's on its way. Good. Frank! The back way! He's up there! Freeze, buddy! Stop! We lost him. Check the streets. He couldn't have gone far. Preston come with me. What he do? In the bedroom. One of the drawers in that piece of furniture's open. There was a Chinese talisman in this drawer. Well, it's gone. It must have been pretty important for him to come back for it. Do we have a picture of it? Yes. Good. At last! I was afraid I would not see you again. You did not answer my summons. Do not be afraid. There is nothing to fear from me. My cat and I have watched over you since your birth. The Chinese object you are holding contains the story of your life. And the task divine will has entrusted to you. It's just as I imagined. It's an antique Chinese legend. In the year of the tiger, the 9,999th time that symbol returns to the celestial sphere. A man from the other side of the world will bring back the stone of evil inside the urn of wisdom. And that same urn will prevent the stone from using its evil powers. What sense do those Chinese legends have today, professor Clint? More than you might imagine. The new generation takes increased interest in the magic and mystic of life. My own university classes in Chinese mythology and mysticism until a few years ago where almost totally ignored and now crammed to overflowing with young students. Scott Edward's birthday. Right. Comparison to the Chinese, we walk upside-down. I get the feeling you'll be checking your horoscope tomorrow. Where are you going? Is that you, master? I've been waiting for you. I didn't expect to find you here, master. Where is it? It's in a locker at government center station. I'll go get it tonight. Good. Now all we have to do is obliterate the Chinese witch. Yeah. , I am the millenary daughter of wisdom. My life is neither time nor space. This urn used to contain the symbol of evil... Taken from ten yama kings by the terrible tai o. It is only right that you should know what happened in that bed such a long time ago. A time that is not of this time, but a time beyond the confines of the human mind. Past and present know no chronological order. I was young and beautiful. I always had been. For the divine wisdom in me overcame old age and death. That man succeeded in enchanting me. I told him all my secrets. Secrets entrusted to me by the gods from the beginning of time. I had my secrets, but I never knew love. Until I met mortom. He did not love me. He loved only power, success. He knew that he could have all that once in possession of that stone of evil, a sculpture in the shape of an ugly boar. Once out of its Jade ampulla and in impure hands, the statue was ready, once again, to release its terrible negative force. The loss of the boar was putting an end to my immortality. Evil has a thousand faces, young man. Seduction, the greatest ally of death. Then what happened? I persuaded Jason mortom to steal the idol from his father. Jason had your same astral characteristics, but he was the son of evil. Full of shameful vices. Jason was weak compared to his driven, immoral father. Jason managed to obtain the idol. But instead of returning it to me, he spitefully blackmailed the reverend, who sent a believer, a cold blooded killer, to murder his own son. And the killer took the key. He must have given it to reverend mortom. Not yet. No! No! This is Francis. Now it is up to you to close the ring of antique prophecy. You must recover the key by dawn tomorrow. A battle you will have to fight using your own wits. The talisman also depicts a woman. She will help you. You have nothing more to fear from her. Joanna brought us together. Am I supposed to believe you're on my team now? I always have been. The truth is full of surprises! Scott, he's more important to me than anything else. You should have told me. I would have understood. Would you have? I've been hurt by so many men before. I couldn't take the chance. Taxi! Madame moon: I know you are here, Samuel. But this time I can defend myself against you. Fu shan! Now you will never stop me. Now you'll never stop me. I shall kill you. Never. God of wisdom, help me! I shall kill you. God of wisdom! Help me! Help me! Help me! But the stone of evil is mine. And shall remain so! Look out! Police! What are you doing? Stop him! There's a murderer up there! Call lieutenant Morgan! Over herel Oh my god! Scott is innocent. You would't believe the whole story. I didn't believe what you said then was the truth. Try me again. Maybe this time you'll get lucky. No. I can walk. Now everything's like before. Yes. What about reverend mortom? He is the last idol we must defeat. Something he's about to take care of for himself. You're finished. You may go. Welcome, my friends. My faithful friends. My beloved friends, the lord has seen fit... To subject me to a terrible test. The loss of my only son. Now that I weep, you weep with me... Ok, Tom take one on the audience. Reverend mortom: I know you weep with me! But let us return to the scriptures. The lord said to Samuel, “raise yourself above pain! And return to your flock. They are your only children now.” So I bathed! I bathed the word of the lord! And I returned to my children. I came back to my flock. To guide, to guide my flock. Steve, give me a closeup of the lady in the black. The one who's crying. She's the fourth one from the end in the second row. Reverend mortom: And god is the head of all of us! And god is above us all! He shines here in our hour! What's this? What the heck is goin on here? Hey! This is our house... This is our house, my dear friends. This is our home and because of that I wanted to plead to you. We need money. Like every other house in the land we've gotta buy... We've gotta buy... We've gotta buy groceries. Ha ha we've gotta pay the... Something wrong with this mic. What's going on? Look at... Hey, you! There's something wrong with the mic. Every time... Hey... She's... Cut the god damn monitor! The Chinese... Cutt! The Chinese wh-... Will somebody tell me what's going on? Who is putting these pictures out? It's pointless, Samuel. This is the end. To have your son murdered by a hired killer. Lying to the world. It wasn't enough for you. You've run out of power, Samuel. You're running on empty. You're the son of all that is evil. In my religion and yours. There's only one kind of evil. It's universal. It's not true. It's not true. She's a liar. No, not me. I'm the woman who loved you. Who you robbed. Tell them, Sarah. Tell them I'm the Cho- I'm the chosen one. No, Samuel. You are not the chosen one. You are the devil! You, Samuel mortom! And I'm tired of suffering in silence! Of suffering in your shadow! Policel movel nobody touch anything! He was the devil! He was! Let's go. What more is there to do here? Don't you think we outta go thank madame moon? Thank her for what? For getting you and me together? Yeah. And me too! And you too?! Alright. What are you waiting for? What happened to her place? It's still a beautiful view. You who do not know life, how can you know death? Confucius look! She's left something of herself behind.
