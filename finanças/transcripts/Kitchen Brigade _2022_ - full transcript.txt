Our contestants have to make a very simple dish, Eggs Benedict, with our star chef Lyna Deletto. Coming right up on The Cook. Order, one ceviche verde, one pumpkin soup! To follow, one tempura, one cannelloni. Yes, Chef! Okay, two covers. One ceviche, one lamb, one soup and one beet organ. Away! For table 14! Here goes. Oh, my God, the smell in here every time! It makes a nice change from Paris. Hello, everyone! Hello, Robin, what are you making? A beautiful apple tart. So you file the tarts? Sure, like nails. A little manicure! I'll come get one later, Robin. What's this? Your new starter? Our very colorful summer tomato. With young shoots. Now that is pretty! Is this a creation you've already tried out? Yes, but it's ever-evolving, depending on what's available. Try to do what I told you. When you look at me, give the camera a smile. People will connect with you. Thanks, honey. -What's this? -Lobster Parmentier. Lobster Parmentier? I noticed this when we came in. It's striking. Our "beet organ." Hello Cathy. Can we add the balsamic vinegar? The balsamic! Honey and hibiscus powder will give it zing. We stick with balsamic. Drizzle it on. How many covers do you do at lunchtime? Around 60. Really? Order, one ceviche verde, one pumpkin soup. To follow, one tempura, one cannelloni. Yes, Chef! -Be ready with the lamb. -Yes, Chef. Where's the monkfish at? Ready, Chef. Run it, please. Baptiste, the two starters? -Go, Baptiste. -Two starters on the pass. Hot behind! Away, table 16! Okay! This won't take long. The beet. Care to explain? I respected my dish's seasoning. The problem is, you added capers to the John Dory, too much basil to the roasted tomatoes… Did they like it or not? -That isn't the question. -It's the question all chefs should ask. So I'll ask it. Serge, did they like it? -Yes. -There you go. I know people come for you, for the goodies, the shows, your book and stuff. But they come for my cooking too. So show me some respect. Let me make myself clear, Cathy. I can find ten like you in the trash. You're part of my brigade, so you follow my rules. Period. Start by removing your earrings. Right. I'm out of here. I've no time for some Z-list celeb. You're unbelievable. -You know where the door is! -Yeah, and I'll kick it in. You know what? There's tons of jobs around. At last! Why didn't you pick up? Ain't there a signal in your kitchen? You're taking the piss! Gimme a break, Fatou. I came as fast as I could. What's she done now? Your face is a mile long. She went and did it again! The beet organ is my dish. She changed the seasoning with her shitty balsamic. It needs honey and hibiscus powder! That's what makes it zing and taste less earthy. Okay, what's this for? Get me out of the Arctic! Hang on, I drove 30 km for that? Sure, you did. Because without fame, you're a nobody. If a trip to the North Pole can make me a global star, I'll go for it! And so should you. You've got two options in life. You act American and make tracks, like me. Or you act French and moan on about hibiscus. -Take my advice. -Fatou, I am making tracks. Go on. It's recording. Hi, I'm Fatou, single and 30. I was born in Wazemmes. I recently did… Hi, I'm Fatou, single and 30. I recently did… All right, let's do it. Hello, I'm Fatou, single and 30. I was born in Wazemmes. I did an ad for Biovidis. I've been an actor for ten years. I recently did an e-learning course with Jean-Michel Parquet, the French voice of Mel Gibson in 1993. You're such a pain. Stop laughing, you're putting me off! Hi Jérôme, it's Cathy Marie. Remember me? You gave me your card… Okay then, call me back. Talk to you in a bit. Hi, it's Cathy Marie. Did you get my message? Yes. Sorry, I… I wanted to know if you were hiring. Because I've left Lyna Deletto. I felt like a change so… Totally. She took it really well. We parted on great terms, but… I was wondering… How's your team? Are you… With Jérémy? Okay, but I trained Jérémy! Changing chefs, sous-chefs, always refreshes… My restaurant? I told you about it? Yes, but it's not even in the pipeline yet. Okay, keep me posted. Keep me posted! HAUTS-DE-FRANCE AUDITION "GREAT CHEFS' SECONDS" TAKE PART IN THE COOK SEASON 12 What's up? Are you sure it's this way? Yeah, positive! Your satnav got it wrong. It didn't. It can't be here. It is! The satnav says so. It doesn't feel right. Beyoncé sang "Don't Feel Right" and now she's in Madame Tussauds! Thanks for that. Go for it! "Charming restaurant, demanding clientele!" I'm going! RECEPTION THIS WAY What's his French score? He's making progress. A ten. See? In math too. Trouble is, his grade level isn't a priority. -Getting him enrolled is. -Excuse me. Hello. I'm looking for Lorenzo Cardi. It's for the chef's position. She's here. -Hello. -Hi. Hello. I'm Sabine. I love Lyna Deletto. Now you're here, I'll be straight with you. We embellished a bit. How's that? Well, we placed an ad, "Hostel for unaccompanied minors seeks cook." We got zero replies. We decided to change our approach. I wasn't really for it. But Sabine kept insisting-- Sorry, I'm a bit lost. I'd just like to know, the "charming restaurant"… -Where is it? -Here, at the hostel. As I said, we embellished… The restaurant's here? Yes. At first, you know… -In the end… -And the "demanding clientele"? They're minors, unaccompanied, foreign and awaiting permits. Migrants. They're placed here on arrival. We assess their academic level and help orient them. As for the cafeteria cook's job, the pay is 1,450 euros a month plus board and lodging. Let's go. It isn't for me. Where? Where now? I don't know. I'm not a cafeteria cook! You've got a better offer? First I've heard of it. Cathy. Make tracks! Take the job, save up and open your restaurant. She's gonna be a drag. I can feel it. -You okay? -Yes. -Sure you don't want me to help? -No. I'm happy to help. Very happy indeed. There we go. -Can I be straight with you? -Sure. If you need anything at all, just knock on my door. -Don't hesitate. -That's kind, thanks. -Where is it? -Upstairs. But it's only a half story. -There's another level? -Yes. No. This is it. Here you go. It's all yours. There's a kitchenette and a sink down the hall. Join us for dinner. You can try my cooking. It isn't haute cuisine. Just an informal meal with the boys. No, thanks. I'd rather be alone tonight. I feel a bit queasy. Use my medicine cabinet. I have what I need. Okay. Here. See you in the morning. What's Lyna Deletto really like? Small. -Enjoy your evening. -You never can tell! You too. Welcome everyone to this extraordinary place. We're in the desert. And in this unusual setting, our contestants will battle it out. They will be joined by our star chef Lyna Deletto. Tune in tonight at 9:00 for The Cook! I don't believe this! Excuse me! Where can I get a coffee? Friendly guy! He will have? -No, you will have. -You will have. What sort of training do you need? Social work. It takes three years. -Three years? -Three years. What's up with it? Fuck! Forget it. I know he can hear me. The crazy fuck could at least answer! I don't believe this! Yeah, I understood. Great! Any idea where it is? Acorn. I AM, I HAVE, YOU ARE… Anemone. Miss, what's a "anemone"? "An" anemone. A beautiful pink flower. "Anemone" equals "flower." Sabine, I can't find the kitchen. Apple. I'm looking for the kitchen. Who wants to take Cathy Marie? Me, miss. Can I take her? -Okay, Gusgus. -I'll find it. Just tell me where it is. Apple. Follow me, ma'am. -Anon. See you anon. -Ma'am? See you anon. It's this way. Is Gusgus your first name? Yes, like in Cinderella. Gustave is for the authorities. And you're Cathy, right? The cook. I'd like to be a cook too. I can't decide between a career in law, social work… Cook would be fine too. You'll have to work hard. It's an arduous path. What does "arduous" mean? That it's difficult and long. How do you spell it? -A-R-D… -A-R-D… -…U-O… -…U-O… -…U-S. -…U-S. "Arduous" equals? Equals difficult, long. That's the kitchen. That was a very pleasant moment. Welcome to the hostel. Nice to meet you. You too, Gusgus. Yes? MAY I HELP YOU? EVEN IF IT'S ARDUOUS No. I'm good, thanks! Go back to your buddies. Very well, madam. Okay. There's no way. "Charming restaurant." Yeah, right! "And informal meals!" What a nightmare! I won't ask you where the pitch is! Boubacar, there! Excuse me. Hey, sir! Sir! May I have a word? Hamstring. How's it going? Have you settled in? No. Thanks. Have you seen the kitchen? I've nothing to work with. Just cans. And the hygiene's borderline. It's good for a hostel, believe me. They like ravioli and soccer. So we give them ravioli and play soccer. He's insane. Unbelievable! You're leaving already? We have an appointment at Immigration. Can I have a chunk of bread? Thanks. Would you like some? Please. I'm kind of hungry. Sabine, could you get the boys? Could you get them? They left. It's 2:15 p.m. Why have they left? They have appointments or they're asleep or not hungry. We can wake them up. -I can go. -No, it's fine. Miss, may I have two portions? Sure, help yourself, Gusgus. Just a sec. I'll go get mine too. -Can you get me some? -Okay. It looks good, huh? -Have some thyme. -I'm good, thanks. This does look tasty. With parmesan too. Cheer up, Cathy. We can always microwave the leftovers tonight. I do it all the time. It goes down a treat. Storms are blowing in. What a pass! But the ball's lost… I'm doing my take on spaghetti carbonara. But I'm not sure about this endive. I'll blend it with my avocadoes to create a tasty emulsion. Lyna, how's Antoine doing? It looks like he's in trouble. Cooking is physical. It's an endurance sport. -Bitch. -Then you're a top athlete… What's up? What is this? The box switches off at 10:00 p.m. To stop the boys spending all night on social media. Or on sites that… Well, naughty sites. Thanks, Sabine! You're welcome. Sleep tight! Can you hear me now? Not very well. Not very well at all. Jean-François just called. The meeting was last night. Starting school now isn't an option. There's too much to catch up on. -They turned me down? -Yes. I'm so sorry. -Why not try Gabriel Péri? -I did. The course is full. Alpha, when do you turn 18? In four… In four months. Thanks for trying, Anne-Marie. I have to go, I've got a class. Call me, Lorenzo. -Will do. -See you soon. Thanks, Anne-Marie. I know you give priority to French students. But I need to enroll him on a vocational course now! Yes. Okay. Thank you. Goodbye. Thirty-five kids haven't eaten. Do you care to explain why? Sure. I'm on my own, so it takes time. Yes, of course. But plating up individually, even if it pleases Gusgus, isn't necessary. Hang on, that's how I am. I do things properly. All right? Teens are interested in quantity. As for presentation… Migrants have no right to good food? That is not what I said. I can't provide 70 meals on time, on my own. If you need help, ask the boys. They'll jump at the chance. Migrants can only play soccer? Is that it? So we're agreed. They have to be free at 2:00 p.m. Please respect the schedule. It's the golden house rule. I want my own suppliers. Look, I have eight euros per kid per day. Stick to that, and do as you… You're the chef. You're the chef, right? Yes, I am. Do as you please. I've no time for this. I'm not her delivery girl! She hassled me for help. I'm an actress! PREPPING COOKING STORES (BUTTER, EGGS… Separate the herbs from the veg! You just asked for a hand. And now I'm your delivery girl! But I've got my career to forge. Fatou, name one actress who hasn't done odd jobs. There aren't any. Not a single one. But you're on Julia Robert's highway. Because shifting all those crates energizes you, nourishes you, strengthens you, builds you up. Can't you feel it? When you land a delivery girl role, you'll be ready. Thanks to who? To me. Thank you, Cathy Marie! Julia Roberts sold pizzas and shoes before Pretty Woman! She's messing with my head. The secret bees of royal jelly. This week… I'm not disturbing you, am I? Not at all. I've a favor to ask. I need three commis. We're here! Cathy. Hang on a minute. Where do we start? This won't work! How many are they? I told you they were motivated. Sabine, I said three commis! Okay. Cut the carrots and zucchini into juliennes. The chopping boards are here. The knives are there and the peelers are here. What's a peeler? It's for peeling veg. What does "julienne" mean? It's like gusgusienne, or mamadouienne, yadafienne, cathytienne… Hey, don't touch the leeks! Or that! Wait. Everyone out of the kitchen. Get out! Off you go. Get out of my kitchen! Put that down. That and that! I need a minute. I can't… -It takes planning. -Of course. -Or it's chaos. -See you later. This doesn't go here! Julienne is a way of cutting vegetables. I've never done it. We'll look on The Cook website. -Is she in trouble? -It's nothing. Chefs often lose it in the upper echelons of French cuisine. The upper echelons say, "Remove your caps!" Sabine, they're clueless about cookery. Sure! We'll start with the basics! It's going to be great. Believe me. SHALLOT TEST I need some commis to help me in the kitchen. A commis is an assistant to a chef. Precisely. You all have shallots. I want you to peel them then slice them finely. Three, two, one, go! Excuse me, ma'am! Can you show me? I don't know how. -Have a go. -I'm done, ma'am. This is exactly what I don't want. It's useless for a sauce. And it isn't what I asked for. This is how I do it. Fine. You can go. Ma'am, men don't cook back home. You must address me as "Chef." Don't boss me around. Fine. Just go. Look at me! -No one tells me what to do. -Take a deep breath. If you won't take orders from a woman, you can go. Respect the basic rules. -If not, the door's there! -Yeah? I'm not forcing anyone. What's this, then? Never mind. Just carry on. Not bad at all. Put the peelings in there. Just so things are clear… Listen up. In my kitchen, there's no religion, men, women or sexuality and, above all, no misogyny. -Is that clear? -Yes. -Yes who? -Yes, Chef! Great. Well done. Excuse me, ma'am! The onions are stinging my nose. -They're shallots. That's too big. -They're shallots. Tiny, tiny, tiny. -Where are the peelings? -Here. -It's for the jus. -Okay, great. Chef? That's great. Good job, Gusgus. When the tests are over, will I be chosen? You have to work first, okay? All right. They've built a multi-billion mall, and the kids are just over there. They just have to cross the road. Easy, huh? And we've got spare beds. -Let me speak to them. -Okay. They're over there, on the right. You okay? How are you? Hi. -This is Lorenzo. -Hello. He runs the hostel I mentioned. Do you remember? Give them the cards. The hostel has a video room and table soccer. Wi-Fi? -Internet? -Yes, we have Internet. You can go on Facebook and Instagram till 10:00 p.m. You can call us 24/7. You can drink, eat and study. I'll introduce you to people who'll get you ID papers. ID papers! -He's clueless. -Let's just hope they show up. What's he doing here? Djibril, stand up, please. -Move it! -How did you get here? Where did you get the cap? Get out of the van. Get out of the van! I'll ask you again. Where did you get this cap? And this? Where did you get it? Djibril? You and I made a promise. And you promised things to Lorenzo. What the hell are you doing here? Explain. -Cathy. -Yes. I'd like a word if you have a minute. Yes. Be quick. I've lots to do. -Sit down. -What is it? I have something to say. Sit down. Cathy, it's very hard for us to form bonds with these boys. They've been exploited by adults. It takes time to win their trust. And we don't have time. If we don't enroll them in school, they'll be deported at 18. If they get up to no good because a cook kicked them out, it's the same thing! -Hang on, if you mean-- -Let me finish. I'm perfectly aware you don't intend to stay here. But while you grace us with your presence, please do not destroy the bond everyone has with them. If a kid comes to help out, do not reject him! Is that clear? Is that clear? Yes. Good. Whether you like it or not, you're like us. It's your job to watch out for them too. There's going to be a penalty. That looks good, Chef. What is it? Linguine with seasonal vegetables. Cathy! Stay with us. Have a seat. Next to Djibril, the soccer pro. He'll explain. Come on, Cathy. Djibril. She's next to you. Go on, tell her. Come on, Djibril. She's listening to you. Djibril. I look stupid now. It's… African countries playing. Mali versus Mauritania. Do you play soccer? Since I was a kid. My dream is to sign a youth contract… with a club. What's that? A contract to become a soccer pro. Like Cristiano Ronaldo. -Have you been to a match? -Not yet. When I have money, I plan to go. One day. This is good. Sorry. This is really good, Chef. Cooking starts with good produce. We'll be picking leeks, cabbages… It's the same method. We'll dig up the vegetables and clean them. We'll brush the dirt off. Got that? I'll show you, okay? That's it. There's another next to it. The markers are these small leaves. Use your hands, or you'll break it. It has a strong smell. Here. -Want to try it? -Yes. Or rather smell it. Everyone saw the ad. Chirac, Zidane… They all snapped it up! It was aired at the World Cup. Excuse me, what are you doing? Fatou was telling us about her acting career. Right. Before Scorsese calls, can you give us a hand? We're stuck with all the work. Great. Thanks a lot. -What's your name? -Mamadou. The crate's full. Take it over there. This is the map of the cheeses of France. Which cheeses do you know? Only Camembert. That's a good start. Where's the Camembert? -There. -No. That's Gruyère. What's Roquefort like? Roquefort has blue bits in it. It's mold, good mold. The taste is quite strong. It's a veined cheese. The tail, the top! Protect your fingers. Look. Okay? BASTING, SEASONING… That's what I'm after. -What are you doing? -Dressing the meat. To dress meat means to remove the unwanted parts. How long has it been in the oven? It's called browning the meat. Browning the meat. Hold your carrot like this. Turn it as you go. Top to bottom. Like a little dancer. There we go. -Got that? -Yes. It rhymes with hill. It's used to flavor pickles. Dill! Basil is great. Smell it. -Radishes are tasty. -Yes, they are. Here you go. Good job! -Is this a cabbage? -Yes. Isn't this great? Look at this! Isn't it beautiful? -Sunchokes. -Hey, look! Cabbage head! What do we filet? Fish! Gusgus, how's the dishwashing? Arduous, Chef! Haven't you ever set a table? No, Chef! God! Go ahead, Djibril. Sell me your veal tataki. Dear Cathy, dear Sabine… Careful, or you'll drop the plate. Hello, ladies, this is a Japanese dish? Start again. You don't know what you're selling. Scallop meat carpaccio with grapefruit. This meat was… Keep still. Stand up straight. Here is our dish. Beef tatapi. Tatati. It's Aveyron and Ségala veal reared in a Japanese field. The crossroads of turf and surf explodes on the palate. I didn't get that. The carrots smell super good. I invite you to try it. Are you apologizing? You're like this! They're French ingredients. I hope you will liked it. Like it. I advise you to try this dish. You'll be loving it. There you go! Cooked in its broth, really with its jus, so tender and served with a selection of baby vegetables. -You made me want to try it. -Yes. -We wanted to eat his tataki. -For sure! -How about Cooking Made Easy? -Take it. SWANN'S WAY I don't mean to pry, but is Cathy Marie your real name? So many stars use pseudonyms. Take Claude François. It's a pseudonym. So I was wondering if Cathy Marie… Cathy was the midwife who delivered me, and Marie was the educator who taught me to cook. She raised me. You were in care? Yep. You never knew your parents? No. It's okay though. I left the home at 16 then worked in a restaurant, where I slept on the premises. After dishwashing all day, I'd cook my own dishes in secret. The chef tried one and hired me as a helper. That's how I started out. I longed to be an archeologist. But my father said I was incapable. "You'll never manage, poor girl." But still… I travel. I watch Blue Planet, Survivor… And I'm transported. To be honest, I'm not a brave person. Don't say that! It isn't true. What you do here is ever so brave. I'm telling you. It's very brave. Right, let's go cook up a storm. Let's do it. VOCATIONAL COURSES Antoine Griezmann was sensational. The Blues striker paved the way with an acrobatic scissor kick in the warm-up against Bulgaria. The French striker has proved he's one of the squad's top attackers. The Blues will take on Germany in… -Good morning, Chef. -Good morning. -Excellent. -Thank you. Good morning, Chef. Can I keep this on? -Sure. -Thank you. -Spotless. Excellent. -Thank you, Chef. -Good morning, Chef. -Your hands? Excellent. What's this here? -It's lit. -It isn't, it's dirty. -Go wash. -Thank you. -With soap, okay? And scrub hard! -Okay. Right, today, for our first meal, we're making rump of veal with carrot puree, individually plated. So I need three station chefs. First station chef… …the roasting ovens. Mamadou. You'll be the station's Griezmann. Griezmann is my favorite player. It's the chef who decides. But I like Griezmann. Second station chef: garnishes. Djibril. You'll have carrots to peel, herbs to chop… It's a striker's role. You'll be assisted by two commis, Mohamat and Irakli. Third station chef: sauces. He's important. Alpha. Exactness, Alpha. I'll make the world's best sauce! Great. The defense… …Boubacar, Sai and Yadaf. You're our wait team. It's your job to set the tables. I want good posture. You're the first point of contact. Cheerful, attentive… Lastly, every team needs a good goalie. And the person I've chosen is remarkable. Gusgus. The job's yours. Dishwasher. It's a big responsibility. You have to intercept and sort the waste, clean all the utensils. -Okay? -Yes, Chef! We're a team today. We form a brigade. I'm counting on you. -Is that clear? -Yes, Chef. Is that clear? Yes, Chef! Okay , Sayed? Ladies and gentlemen… The Aveyron and Ségala veal… Ladies and gentlemen, we have rump of Aveyron and Ségala veal with rosemary, served with carrot puree. You can go now. Okay, back to the kitchen to plate up! Yes, Chef! Away! -Ready, Alpha? -Yes, Chef. Follow me. Let's go. Neatly, that's it. Small servings, okay? That's great. Good. Excellent. Away! Come on, guys, speed it up! Well… There's still lots to learn. It was a very simple dish. And we can do much better. That said, for a first attempt… …you weren't bad at all. You know why, Chef? -Because we're the… -Best! Because we're a… Brigade! -Because we're the… -Best! -Because I'm the… -Mascot! -Hey, don't relax now! -Brigade, brigade, brigade! Brigade, brigade, brigade! Go on. It's ringing. On Thursdays, she's away recording her show. -You've told me ten times. -It's the day she records her show. -Got that? -It's ringing. Lyna Deletto, hello. It's Lyna Deletto. Of course it is! -It's her restaurant. -Hello. Go on! Hello, I'd like to book a table -for Thursday evening. -Perfect. -We're fully booked. -Hang up. Say the following Thursday. -Hello? -Excuse me, ma'am, allow me to explain. I'm Kim Kardashian's impresario. I'm tasked with organizing her surprise birthday party, and I just got the okay from David Letterman. -Calm down. -I'm perfectly calm! If you can't help, not to worry, I will call Fouquet's. They'll be delighted to have us. I'm sure of it. I shan't thank you. Goodbye! I'll see what I can do. Hold the line. -What's she saying? -We've managed to find you a table. But I won't be there Thursday. That's all right. -They won't hold it against you. -How many are you? Ten people. Twenty, ma'am. -No! -Noted. Excellent. See you Thursday. Thank you. Goodbye. How many fingers? I see ten. But for Kim's birthday, we have to be 20. Otherwise it's ridiculous. I'm dining at Lyna's restaurant! She's so stupid. Five minus x equals… …three. X equals? Right… Here you go. Five grams of flour… …minus x equals three grams of flour. What's the value of x? -Two grams. -Excellent. Now you've got that, I'll make things harder. One sheet of pastry… How many for three quiches? -Three! -Yes. Now for something harder. 150 grams of bacon bits. For three quiches? 450. You lot whispered the answer! Especially at the back. Coming! Sorry to bother you, Chef. My mom wants to speak to you. She insisted. I didn't want to bother you. Okay. -Hello. -Hello, ma'am. Are you my son's chef? That's right. I insisted on speaking to you, to thank you for everything you're doing for my boy. I'm not doing much. You are, you're doing a great deal. You'll make him a great chef, eh? He has the makings of one. -It's nice to speak with you. -Shall I put Mamadou back on? Yes, but I'd like to know if he told you about our spices. We have some great spices. -Has he told you? -No, but I'm sure he will. -I'll put Mamadou back on. -Okay, thank you. Thanks. Do you believe she exists now? Of course. That wasn't hard, was it? -How are you? -I'm doing well. But I have to hang up. I'm in her room. -I'll go out and call you. -Who are you going out with? No one! I meant outside. Where are you going? To my room, to call you. Chat with your mom. I really miss you, son. I know but I have to go. -Go on, then! -Goodbye. Love you. Love you. Goodbye. She always worries. -That's normal. -Sorry to have bothered you. I'll be going. Thank you. -Thank you, Chef! -Thank you, Chef! Don't relax now. Chef? I like you a lot. Shall I shut the door? -Hello. -Hello. Hi, Anne-Marie. PROFESSIONAL COOKERY DIPLOMA SETTING UP A VOCATIONAL COURSE It's ambitious. These things take time. But if you succeed, 20 will be enrolled. Thanks. How about a drink some time? Sure. Thanks. It looks smart, huh? -Just one thing… -Sir? -The bill is on me. -Of course. Thank you. I imagined David Letterman taller. Awesome! Ladies and gentlemen, beet organ with honey vinegar and hibiscus powder, Cathy style. You worked here? Yes. Bon appétit! Do you know the expression "Proust's madeleine"? No. It's a taste or a smell that triggers a memory. And my Proust's madeleine is the dish you're about to try. -Do you like it? -Yes. You do? It's important for me to share it with you. It's a part of me. CHILDREN'S HOME There we go. That's called a golden beet. Excellent. Now we'll use a tube-cutter. The first part of the organ. Hey, you're a natural! I'm Yadaf. I'm from Ethiopia. When I was in Ethiopia, I was a student. I was doing a college prep course. It wasn't my choice to leave my country. My father was an important merchant. He went on a business trip and never came back. My dad was living with his second wife. He gave me to someone, a man who smuggled people to Europe. They sent us to houses underground. They took everything. I was 16. In Morocco, I spent nearly three months. After Morocco, it was… Pakistan, Iran, Turkey, Greece, Serbia, Croatia, Austria then Belgium. I'm from Congo. I'm ten. My dream is to succeed in life. I'm from Bangladesh. I came via India. That was a year ago. I left on my own. I was 14. I came to France to help my brother, by finding a job, earning money and sending it to him. I thought maybe I could work in a hospital in France. Now my dream is to go home, see my mom's face and show her I'm somebody. And for her to be proud of me. It's a dish from home. It's called injera. Every day before school, my mom would make me this dish. I really want to feel I'm with my grandma and mom. I'm going to make it for you. Today I'm presenting you a dish called chicken with mafe sauce. It's the sauce my mom taught me. The first sauce. I often made it with her. I miss her so much. I miss her. Come on, Djibril! Come on, Djibril! Come on, Reda! -Djibril. -Come on, Djibril! Arthur, come here. Hi, Arthur. You're pretty good. -Who do you play for? -Béthune FC. Let's chat after the match. -Yes, Djibril! -Come on! -Do amateurs score goals? -No. I don't think so! So you're not an amateur. That guy was so wrong. An amateur! All Ronaldo has to do is score. Don't let anyone say you're an amateur. You scored the only goal. You should have been selected. When you're at Man United, send the idiot a postcard! We've got tickets for the final. Djibril, you'll present the county cup. He wants a youth contract! Thanks, Cathy, I know. But you said nothing. You just stood there and nodded. I do not appreciate you questioning my work. Do not tell me what to do. Not in front of a teen who could use it against me. When I have something to say, I say it. And so should you. You should have said we didn't want their cup. Djibril doesn't want it either. That's what you should've said. You have no ambition. Have you quite finished? I'm trying to set up a professional cookery course here. I was going to tell you in due course. That's my ambition for them! To keep them here in France. You see… BETHUNE LAW COURT …CLAIMS HE IS AN UNACCOMPANIED MINOR… …MEDICAL EXAMINATIONS… They doubt the authenticity of their ID papers, so they'll determine their age by x-raying their bones. If the medical examiner believes they're over 18, they'll be tried and deported. "To have a lot on one's plate equals to have plenty of work to do. To talk a load of tripe equals to talk a lot of nonsense. To upset the apple cart equals to spoil someone's plans. To cook someone's goose, to spoil someone's chances." I'll raise the table now. BONE AGE BETWEEN 18 AND 22 YEARS OLD… The tests just came back from the hospital. They confirm you're over 18. My family is counting on me. My mom depends on me too. I didn't think… …it would be so hard to live here. I thought… …there was everything here. I'm sorry, Djibril. There's nothing I can do. Gushgush, there'll be a podium for the winning side. The cup will be here, on the stand, okay? Right, Michel, we'll use the music you played for the seniors. But I'd like you to be on time. Gushgush, do you understand? Do you understand? He doesn't understand. Can you picture it? There'll be journalists, local representatives, -important people-- -Don't treat him like an idiot. I mean, I know the day you present the county cup… …the planet will thank you! You know what? He's the one who deserves a cup. And his name isn't Gushgush. It's Gusgus. Ever heard of Cinderella? -Of course I have. -Brush up on your classics! Sabine, let's go. Coming! -Come on. -The county cup! What even is that? Hello. What's your surname? -Your first name? -Pierre. -Have you entered before? -No, never. -Thank you. You can go over there. -Thank you. Cathy? It's right there. Follow me. Appearing on The Cook is the chance of a lifetime. And I'm grabbing it! Cathy Marie is a born fighter. She grew up in care and worked her way up the gastronomy ladder on her own. Since childhood, she has clung to her dream of becoming a chef. They were 12, but only 3 remain. Today, Cathy, Enzo and Alexis battle it out in the final knockout stage. Only two contestants will have the honor of reaching the Grand Final and taking home 50,000 euros. Welcome to The Cook, Great Chefs' Seconds. Three, two, one, go! I'm making jumbo shrimp ceviche with lots of herbs and freshness. I'm pairing it with the fennel. -It looks good. -Yes. -You're marinating the turnips? -That's right. I'm going to make a coulis… Isn't it a bit simplistic for a semifinal? Isn't it a bit simplistic for a semifinal? I'm a simple girl. This is how people like turnips. Contestants, you've got five minutes. It's time to plate up! -One to go, Chef. -Easy on the lemon. Wipe the plate. Yes, Chef. Mackerel in the Garden. What d'you say? Let's call the dish that. Four, three, two, one… Hands in the air! Respect the rules. Move away from your dishes. Thanks a million! Cathy! We're in the town's main shopping street, looking for Cathy Marie's pop-up restaurant. You can see how focused she is. And no wonder because there's 50,000 euros at stake… Cathy, your first impressions? It's perfect! -Well? -It's perfect. Enzo, as your assistant, you have chosen Arno, a kitchen help. Cathy, you're focusing on the decor. -Yes. -And you've chosen Fatou… …an interior designer. Welcome, Fatou! Mind those cobblestones. You're remarkably graceful. Please go and stand to Cathy's right. -Thank you, Fatou and Arno. -Why d'you do that? -Coz I love it. -It's OTT. -It isn't. -It's totally OTT. -I'm gorgeous. -We'll discover your restaurants.

A mother and her son. So… Micka, run to Cathy Marie's. Enzo's is a yawn. I need interesting shots. Patou, I'll be at Cathy's in two minutes. Easy, easy! What's wrong? Open the door for them. The door's locked. Locked? It can't be! -Cathy? -Tom, Cathy's door's locked. -Can you go open it? -We'll be there in one minute. Me and Kevin. -Got the drill? -Yeah, I do. Why are they doing this? We're going live. -Going live in five, four… -Come on! Micka, smile. Smile, please. We're coming to you live. Let's go see our second contestant, Cathy Marie. I imagine our favorite chef is hard at work. In fact, I can hear some noise. So, Cathy… Cathy, it's Mickael! We're in trouble, Patou. She's barricaded herself in. -The best moments in three… -Cathy's best moments, Micka. Dear viewers, while you're waiting, here are Cathy Marie's best moments. Rolling. Hang on, Patou, something's wrong here. -Just calm down. -Why has she barricaded herself in? She's locked herself in! Do you know the woman? -Did you check her out? -Of course we checked her out! Did we check her out? Not really. It's fine. Everything's awesome. What now, Patou? -Cue the sponsors? -Yes. For fuck's sake! Get a move on, guys! Do the sponsors. Sponsors in two, one… On air! I think we have time to showcase our sponsors. They are Terra Delyssa olive oil and Lagostina kitchen utensils. You need to give me some space. Chill. Folks will think you're nuts. It's dead next door. Enzo's is a yawn. -It's open. -Come on. -Come on, move! We're going to wing it. -Seven, six, five… -Go in now! -…four, three, two, one… Here we are at last outside Cathy Marie's restaurant. We finally managed to open the door. We can't wait to see inside. Go ahead, Sylvie, go into the restaurant. Check it out. Your son is right behind you. #COOKERY COURSE TO SAVE MIGRANTS Oh, fuck! Patou, I'm not going in. It's the work of a psychopath! What the hell is this? Cathy, are you there? -Do have a seat. Sit down. -Okay. Cathy, are you there? We're coming live from Cathy Marie's restaurant. As you can see, the decor is kind of unusual. We have no idea what awaits us in the kitchen. Cathy? Are you there? It's Mickael. What the hell is this? Hello. Welcome to Cathy Marie's. Who the fuck is that? Right, we're in the kitchen. And we're kind of stunned… What the fuck is this? There are a dozen commis hard at work. Ask them where she is. I'll cut to Enzo's. Where's Cathy Marie? -Good evening. -Good evening. I'd just like… Gentlemen, please, don't make things harder. I'm coming back to you, Micka. Enzo's is a disaster. The camera's on you. Just find Cathy Marie. While we wait for Cathy, tell us about yourself. I'm Mamadou. I want to become professional by taking Cathy Marie's course. Excellent. Good luck with your exams! If she can't set up the course, we'll be deported. The guys are migrants! And we're on air! This situation is highly unusual. I'd like to be a chef in France. You'd like to be a chef. Do you have the right to be here? -Not yet, no. -Okay. -Are there any legal migrants here? -No. I'm screwed. Welcome to Cathy Marie's. I suggest the beef bourguignon à la Mamadou. It's a fusion of the Aveyron and Guinea. Expect to be transported. The dish is a foretaste of our slow-cooking process. What's Proust's Saka-Saka by Gusgus? And two Saka-Sakas, please. The beef! Away! Hi, I'm Fatou, single and 30. -I did an ad for Biovidis. -What? I don't know who she is! She's on repeat. Who gives a fuck anyway? Live, live, live! What a moment of television gold, live on The Cook tonight! Let's return to the kitchen, where there are youngsters at work. Hi, TV! I'm Alpha Barry from Côte d'Ivoire. If there's anyone watching who can help Cathy Marie set up her course… I'd like to thank Cathy Marie for teaching me so much. I'm motivated, kind, punctual and respectful. We need youngsters like them. They've got ambition, drive and the will to learn. Look who I'm with, a big fan of Cathy Marie. Good evening. You're on air. She's taken my mic. Boubacar really moved me, and I need someone. Sorry, I have another call. I'll call you back in a minute. Hello, I have two places available on a course in Treignac. My biggest dream is… …to open a restaurant in Paris. Even if it's arduous, I'll do it. I'd like to be called "Chef" one day. It'd suit me if folks said, "Yes, Chef!" That's my dream! I have to dream. Three Saka-Saka tabboulehs! -Three Saka-Sakas, please. -Get a move on! Come on! -Because we're the… -Best! -We're a… -Brigade!
