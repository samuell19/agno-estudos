When is our next race, Ryousuke? When you beat all the downhill racers in Gumma, then I'll race you. Off-road? Downhill. All the downhill roads in Japan. Starting tomorrow, you start from the south, I'll start in the north. We'll compete with different downhill racers. Let's see who ends up winning more, okay? You're not gonna race on the tracks? Racetracks? Downhill roads are much more fun. AKINA VISITOR CENTER, CAMPSITE FUJIWARA TOFU I'm back. What's wrong? Honey. Help me change my underpants. Son of a bitch! Why did you change my underwear? Where are you going? Off to school. School? Isn't it your summer vacation? You're always out. Are you turning tricks now? Lingerie? You know what a god is? A god was once human. But he could do what other humans could not. That's why he became a god. A year ago, that bitch of a principal expelled me. She said, "Itsuki, why don't you call yourself 'Eat Shit' instead?" Then it hit me. I have to tell the world. Itsuki's not a piece of shit. I'll be a racer. Within a year, I've become the racing god of Mt. Akina. The boss of the SpeedStars race team. But you didn't get your license until last year. That's what we call "talent." It's simple, just like drifting. How? Pull the handbrake at a turn to swing the car sideways. How's that? Cool. Won't it slow the car down? How do you drift then? Floor the gas pedal. Don't slow for the bend. Then-- Then you and your car fly off the cliff. I don't blame you. We got our licenses together. Yet you still haven't touched the wheel. Why don't you join my team? I don't have a car. Don't worry, you can wash mine. I drive, you wash. What a promising career. Come on, bro. Cheers! Milk. What's so good about it? Lots of calcium and protein. Also, it's good for your eyes. A good racer needs good eyes. -Want to go to a movie later? -Great. I can't. I've got my part-time job. Had an eyeful? Natsuki, from Class 2B. They're white today. Having fun? Why so concerned? Are you guys close? Not at all. No? I heard you had a fight over her. With Bulldog from the neighboring class. Time for work. Right, time for my allowance, too. Okay. Let's get to work. Were those your classmates? Yes. They look like punks. Street racers? No, they work at the gas station after school. They work hard, but only earn only 100,000 yen a month. I bet you've spent all the cash I gave you last time. Thanks for taking care of me and my mom, but that's too much. Take it. You deserve it. What kind of dad are you? I'm only asking you for a million yen, and you say no? I'm worried you'll be all alone during your final years. I'm sure my last years will be just fine. How so? What if I leave you after I become a world champ? I still have my gas station. I need some change, Boss. After you die, it will be mine anyway. Get it? Thank you. Okay, consider that an advance from my pay. An advance? Excluding the money I spent raising you, you have already borrowed 8,635,000 yen. An advance? What have you done, Mr. World Champ? I have no idea. Welcome, sir. Which gas would you prefer? Does the racing god of Mt. Akina own this gas station? Sorry, but I don't know. Is that so? Look, this is what a car should be. Great body kit, alloy rims. Wow, sports wheel, too! What's the price tag on this? Are you the racing god of Mt. Akina? Actually, I am. But I was told he's the owner here. Yes, I'll be the owner in a few years, when he dies. You hit your own son. Beware of divine intervention. We're the NightKids Team from Myogi. My name is Nakazato. I'd like to race the racing god of Mt. Akina. There's no racing god in Mt. Akina. If you're looking for God, there's a temple over there. Anyway, I'll be waiting for you at Mt. Akina tonight. Wash the car. We'll go up to Mt. Akina tonight. How many races have you won? How about you? Same here. Who are you racing tonight? How about we go for a race first? It's so crowded. You sure you can manage? Take it easy. I'll give my best. I have to be home at 3:00. You know my dad. Don't worry. What? Still nervous? Look, so many people. Hurry up. I need to give my assistant a ride home. You gonna take him with you in the race? Is that forbidden? Looks like this guy knows nothing at all. Well, in that case, I'd better sit with you. Are you guys gay or what? I better leave. Fatty, we'll start from here. The first one to the parking lot wins. Bullshit. Of course the faster one wins. Five. Four. Three. Two. He's a real amateur. We'll see at the first bend. The car behind is kissing ours. This guy is clueless. What are you gonna do? Just stay calm. Let's overtake him. It's safer. There's no need. -Watch out ahead. -What? Ahead! Look what you've done! I told you to stay calm. It's your fault because you wouldn't stay calm! See? I told you I would get you home on time. Asshole. What do you mean? You're the asshole who puked just after a ride. Looks like it's about time we have a race here. It's not the right time yet. Why? You want to know the truth? Go ahead. I noticed something while I was in your car. You're not smooth each time you attack a bend. Yeah, your GTR has big horsepower, but the engine is heavy. There are so many bends in Mt. Akina and you have to understeer at every turn, especially at the five consecutive hairpins. You couldn't change to the inside lane every time. Unless you overcome this, you stand no chance against my FC. Unless you overcome this, you stand no chance against my FC. So glad you're safe. You have to be safe in order to be a world champ. I want to buy a GTR. I'll get you a Mercedes instead. -I want to buy a GTR. -And a Rolex. I want to buy a GTR. But you almost killed yourself last night. It wouldn't happen if I was driving a GTR. If you were driving a GTR, you would have died. I want to buy a GTR. Welcome. How may I help you? You can't help me, I'm here for the fatty racing god. Racing god? What now? Are you trying to put me down? I lost to an AE86 last night. He dashed around the bend with inertia drift. I could only catch the tofu shop decals on it. FUJIWARA TOFU You know him? If you do, just tell him that I'll be waiting for him on Mt. Akina Saturday night. Takumi? Hey. It wasn't me. I was here last night. Whoever beat him last night is the real racing god. Don't tell me it was you. It's my old pal, Bunta. What? Say it again. I know it sounds unbelievable, like me standing here looking at you. But the guy with the GTR did say you beat him. GTR? Is it very powerful? It's 350 horsepower, four-wheel drive, reinforced body, it's Japan's national treasure. So what? Just go race with him for fun. It's really hot. I'd kick your ass if you were my dad. -Welcome. How can I help you? -Fill up the tank, please. Okay, wait a second. I'm leaving! Take care! Take care, bye! Takumi! Takumi! Takumi! Takumi! Didn't you say "hot spring rice bun" is your favorite? I'm very sorry you were punished by the principal for beating up the other guy because of me. I've been trying to thank you ever since. But you seemed to ignore me every time I saw you. It's because, I'm afraid-- I'm afraid the school-- That others in school would think that-- You're afraid that they would think we're in a relationship? We've been in the same class since grade school. We've always talked about anything. But these days it seems like you're avoiding me. I haven't talked to you for weeks already. How's the bun? So can we still hang out again? I have something important to tell you. I bought a very sexy swimsuit. Before the finals, you promised to take me for a spin to the beach. Have you forgotten? I bought the swimsuit right after you told me that. I even chose the one with the least fabric. Why are you looking like that? You're choking? Are you okay? I'm okay. How are you? Are you okay? Don't scare me like that. I'm okay. Takumi, you're picking me up at the gas station this Sunday. You promised. I've got to go now. You're picking me up at the gas station this Sunday. You promised. Dad. Have you beaten a GTR in Mt. Akina recently? I think so. Was the car real fast? It was seriously fast on straight roads. But when it entered bends, it became real slow. You really found it slow? What do you want to know? Nothing really. Just curious. I bought a very sexy swimsuit. Do you need your car this Sunday? Yeah. The market union is having a potluck. Want to go? No, thanks. What a rude brat. Hey, Tofu-man! FUJIWARA TOFU What's up, Gas-man? I'm looking for you. What for? I thought you might want a little fun. Cheers! What's this? Let's drink! You're asking me out tonight. So you're not mad I don't go to your gas station? No. I was mad you asked everyone not to come. Because your gas was too expensive. But my gas is of higher quality. -So you asked me out to talk about this? -No. I didn't expect you could still hold up at your age. You asked these girls to test me out? I'll show you. I'm talking about you beating the GTR the other night. That wasn't me. I haven't been delivering in Mt. Akina for years. So who was it, then, a ghost? That was my boy, Takumi. Takumi? One night, five years ago, my hemorrhoids were hurting bad. It was excruciating. They were this big. Damn! So I asked my boy to deliver for me. But he was barely 13 then. What's the big deal? It's Mt. Akina. There's not a soul at 4:00 in the morning. I would just let him. He would leave at 4:00, and come back home at 5:30. A year later, he'd come back at 5:15, or even at 5:00. Two years later, he was getting back by 4:30. Within half an hour? Including delivery? It only takes him four and a half minutes to go around Mt. Akina. Are you telling me... he never had an accident? Not at all. Once he rushed home to sleep and floored the pedal. All the tofu was smashed. Put this in the car. Don't spill a single drop, or I'll kill you. Go. It took him two hours to get back at first. Then, one and a half hour. A month later, it was an hour. Gradually, it became half an hour. But I haven't been timing him lately. Your boy is so good. Why don't you ask him to race the GTR driver again? I'll pay for the gas. I was treated as a shitty racer when I was young. Turns out, my boy would be even worse. You know, he's the only son in the whole family. If anything happens to him-- Get another one, then. Hey, Tofu-man. Tofu-man. But what about the GTR? And tonight's bill? Tofu-man. You bastard. Bring me the scissors. I bought a very sexy swimsuit. Boss, this Sunday... -I'd like-- -Let me through! What do you want? Dad, I've decided not to buy the GTR now. That's my boy. Takumi's dad is right, a racer should get up again after each defeat. Dad. Let me race in your car tonight. My car? From this moment on, I'm no longer your dad. So how about Mom? What about Mom? If she finds out you went to the nightclub last night, what do you think she would do? RECEIPT Who are you looking for? Tofu-man, you bastard. You sent my son to die. Itsuki drove off with my car. You have to ask Takumi to go to Mt. Akina tonight. I'm not free right now. What do you mean by that? This is the first time I've begged you, and you're saying no? What about the nightclub bill last night? What kind of tofu do you want? Nineteen years ago, the fastest racer in Gumma Province was Bunta Fujiwara of Mt. Akina. A gifted racer of that era. Many racers told me that you could have been Japan's first world champ. But you chose to get married 19 years ago. You became a tofu seller instead of a racer. Sometimes, a single decision can change one's whole life. It happens with racing, and it happens with life. But not everyone can figure out the consequence. Like you didn't guess your wife would leave you. Anger. That's what a racer needs. I want to race you. Just once. Sorry, what you want is not for sale here. Please go to another shop! Sorry to disturb you. Hey, don't answer it. It's some asshole calling. Hey! You want to use the car tomorrow? Go up to Mt. Akina tonight. If you can beat the GTR, I'll let you use my car tomorrow. With a tank full of gas. Tofu-man! If Takumi beats the GTR at Mt. Akina tonight, your nightclub bill will... will, you know-- We've blocked all the cars going uphill already. All the roads are clear. The race can start any time. Hey, racing god, give me a break, okay? You couldn't even enter a bend. With this car... I'm afraid you'll die. What are you doing? This is a public area. You can't block the road with guys holding walkie-talkies. I'll call the cops. You really won't leave? After you. What are you doing? Don't mess with my car! Don't touch my car. You don't belong here! Don't touch my car! Ryousuke, an AE86 is coming uphill. The real racing god has arrived. Takumi's dad. Itsuki. Oh, Takumi, it's you. Where's your dad? Uncle? Is he hiding? No, he asked me to come. For what? Delivering tofu? No, to race the GTR. Stop pulling my leg. You don't even know how to enter a bend. You'll die. That's okay. I've been delivering tofu here for five years. I know, but you just got your license last year. I've already beat him once. So it was you last time? Tofu-man. Tofu-man! If Takumi wins, is the nightclub bill settled? Didn't we discuss this two hours ago? Two hours ago? The GTR is very fast. You think Takumi has a chance? All your cars were more expensive and faster than mine. But did you ever win, you idiot? That's different because you're crazy. Did I ever say that my son is normal? Five, four, three... -Go for it! -...two, one. Don't wag your tail too much! But the AE86 isn't picking up speed. It's okay to lose a little at the beginning. There are fewer straights and more tight bends later. That will be the showtime for my boy. The mighty GTR is leading all the way. The AE86 is no match for it on straight roads. It catches up a little bit at the bends. But I'm afraid it has no chance to get near the GTR. They're entering the curves. The AE86 is gaining. But the GTR's turns are extremely precise. The AE86 has changed tactics and begun to drift. They're getting closer at the center of the curve. The AE86 attacks the bend very fast. The cars almost touched each other as they drifted out. Your boy is really that good? A few years ago, my boy told me he needed glasses. So I took him to an optician. But his eyesight turned out to be 20-20. I told him, "Hey, kid, I'll kick your ass if you're kidding me." And he said, when he drove, he found everything else getting slower and slower. I knew then that he was getting faster and faster. I lost at this bend last time. It won't happen again. The AE86 is sticking close to the GTR. Unbelievable. The AE86 tries to overtake, but the GTR blocks the lane. That's unfair! It's foul play! You want a good beating? The AE86 fails to pass, but they're closer at the bend. The AE86 is looking for a chance at the end. If what you said is true, then it's a sure win for Takumi? It all depends on... the last five consecutive hairpins. The last five hairpins. The AE86 isn't slowing down. He can't pass at this speed. The AE86 has passed the GTR on the inside! Can the GTR catch up at the remaining hairpins? The GTR is slowing down, the AE86 has won! Some driving style you've got. Weren't you up the hill? How did you get down here so quick? I heard you used the gutter when entering the bend, right? Huh? I'd like to race you, too. Have you got time? I'm sorry. I raced tonight because my dad asked me to. I don't think there'll be a next time. Maybe you'll change your mind tomorrow. It's done. I've raised you right. You make me proud. Hey, come on. What is it? Nothing. -What's with the towel? -It's the sunlight. Don't be shy. Is it because I'm wearing a bikini? No, it's not. Takumi, how did you get these wounds? These wounds were... inflicted by my dad. After Mom left us, Dad got drunk all the time. He would beat me up whenever he got drunk. Disgusting, huh? I think you look manlier that way. A real man's got to have a few scars on his body. I hate those sissies with smooth skin. Especially this one on your back. That was three years ago. -This one is last week's. -Does it hurt? And here? That's a mosquito bite. You fooled me. Here we are. Your driving is really good, Takumi. I always felt carsick on long rides. But I didn't even need to take pills today. That's good. I really had a fantastic time today. Thanks so much. You're welcome. You know what a god is? A god is actually human. But he can do what other humans can't. God, please save me. Please save my car as well. Sit down. There, there. What are you doing? What's with our "World Champion," Boss? He bought a new car. What about Takumi? That's easy. He's in love. What's with you today? You wouldn't get it. Of course I will. A man's problem can only be cash or chicks. What do you want? You said you'd teach me how to drive. When did I say that? Who cares. I'll drive downhill as fast as possible. Give me a few tips. Given my talent, I'll catch on fast. Let's go, then. It'll be quick. Buckle up. There's a car behind you. Wow, so fast. Can't wait to get laid or what? Turn on the hazard lights. Let the car pass. He hit us! What happened? Sorry, I thought it was the tofu shop's AE86. But it's just a piece of junk. Kids. Don't cruise around at this hour. Better go home and sleep. He meant you. He must be gay, wearing a bandanna at night. I think he's up on the hill for-- Junk. Simply junk. Let me drive! Say something. What are you thinking? He was trying to kill us. Didn't you see? So what? He said you're a piece of junk. Let him say whatever he likes. We don't care. Hey, the brakes. Hit the brakes, yo! The brakes! Itsuki, what's wrong with your car? What about it? It's not braking when it enters a bend. All four wheels are flying off the ground. And it almost oversteers every time it exits a bend. So why are you still driving so fast? I've got to chase that asshole. I want to go home! Daddy! Daddy! Itsuki, are you okay? Are you sure? Takumi, what kind of driver are you? I'm sorry for wrecking Itsuki's car. I'll pay for it. I'm not talking about this. Did you know... the guy last night is a member of the Emperor Team? He's a professional racer. You beat his EVO in this piece of junk. Are you crazy or what? But it's exactly the same as my dad's. How could it be the same? Your dad has spent so much time and effort on that car. It took him a month to find the right suspension. This one over here. Only an idiot like my boy could be conned to buy this crap. Where's Itsuki? The World Champ's useless. Just a spin and he's still puking now. Who would get carsick? Takumi, you're different. You'll probably become an ace racer one day. Keep it up. Hey! What's wrong? You dropped your money? The suspension. It took you one month to fix it? Why so long? Not just the suspension. I needed to test the tires, the brakes, ride height, balance between front and rear. It took about a month. Is it really fun being a racer? Why? You want to be a racer? I don't know. You don't know? Then come on in and help me make tofu. Your friend's been helping me the whole afternoon. My friend? Oh, you're too kind. It's no trouble. Please have some tea, Uncle. The tofu is done. I also made some snacks. -Thanks. -You're welcome. Takumi, you're back. How come you're here? Look who's talking. You haven't called me once since we went swimming. So I came to pay you a visit. Natsuki, where are the snacks? Just a second. It's so nice having a woman in the house. Oh, and in such a short skirt. If only it was two inches shorter. You should've called me first. I called you several times. You were either at work or sleeping. Luckily, Uncle is a nice guy. He ain't a nice guy. But I've been chatting with him on the phone for days. He's actually very fond of you, you know? You've been chatting with him for days? -What's so strange about that? -What did he say? Uncle told me you want to be a racer. I never said that. He also told me, if you try hard enough, you'll become a world-class racer someday. Someone once told me, it's most important to find a world that belongs to us. Life has meaning only when we can find this world. Takumi, I think, for you, this world is racing. Who told you that? An uncle who told me that. Uncle? Since my father died, he's been taking care of me and my mom. I thought you meant my dad. I knew he couldn't be that deep. So who is this uncle, Natsuki? It's most important to find a world that belongs to us. Life has meaning only when we can find this world. If you try hard enough, you'll become a world-class racer someday. Takumi, I think, for you, this world is racing. -Hey. What's up? -Are you delivering tofu this early? Something wrong with the car? Wrong? I'm tuning it. Remember I told you I want to race with you? I never agreed. If I ask you again now, would you agree? Does fine-tuning the suspension and the tires really take a whole month? -You want to know? -Yeah. It's crucial to increase the barometer of the turbocharger. But keep an eye on the air intake volume. And the exhaust valve needs to be accommodated. Suspension must be tuned based on hardness and travel, the tire size and its camber angle on the road, plus the lower arm bar and strut tower bar. Then fine-tune it based on the computer data. Your dad is incredible. If I were to retune it, it would take me at least six months. The balance has been tuned to its optimal level. Simply put... it's perfect. So my old man really is that good. However, every car has its limit. You're bound to find it unsatisfactory one day. Just get another one. But I only like AE86. So how about our race? Three weeks from now. On Saturday. That long? You said it took three weeks to retune your car, right? -That's him. -Got it. Be careful. He's very fast in the bends. It's just an AE86, after all. Are you okay? Listen, this junk is for tofu delivery, not for racing with us. It's for your own good, got it? That's right. You're professional racers. Of course you look down on us street racers. Professional and street, we're all racers. Right, you beat me once. -You remember? -Want to win again? Okay, call me. You have my team's number. Is the AE87 out already? Isn't it the AE89 now? Just talk, don't fight. Hitting your kid in public will inflict mental damage. Shut up! Tofu-man. Let's talk, not fight. Hitting your kid in public will inflict mental damage. I'm going home. Still upset about losing? I challenged Kyouichi, the guy who beat you, to a race in three weeks. You're invited. If you don't have another car, I do. Thanks, but I only want to drive my own car. Give me a call if you change your mind. Want some cheesecake? It's delicious. Natsuki bought it for you. When did she come? She'll be in her hometown for two weeks, but will call you later. What else did she say? What else is she supposed to say? Hey! Are you going to eat the whole cake? You'll eat yourself to death! Tofu-man, your AE86 is already an antique. Might as well change to a new car. Don't tell me you're going to put that in the AE86? Isn't this great? This is for race cars only. You want to go to jail? You're nuts. Catching roaches, Itsuki? No, I'm looking for my old man. He hasn't been back for days, just like you. There's a customer. That sucks. He's not young anymore. He's so irresponsible, leaving his business like this. What's going to happen to me if it goes bankrupt? It's good that I've been living on my own, or else I wouldn't be this chubby. -Boss! What are you doing? -Boss! Are you all right? What happened to you? -Help him! -Help him out. -Be careful. -Hold him there. -Get the bucket! -Let's move him. What made you so sick? Uncle, what are you up to? We went for a spin at Mt. Akina. Has he come down yet? He's coming. Sounded like a high RPM. But it wasn't fast enough as it entered the bend. Hop in. I'll only show you once. Watch carefully. Pay attention to the new tachometer. Its power won't become obvious until 11,000 revs. Sit tight. I want to drive faster. Miya. The Kaiseki dinner was delicious, huh? Not bad. I'm glad. Thanks so much for taking care of me when I puked for two whole days last time. You were like a goddess who saved me. -You're crazy. -I mean it. I believe in gods. A god actually used to be human, but he could do what other humans could not. So he became a god. But, you know, a god also does what most humans do occasionally. -What do you mean? -Most humans would... sometimes go to this local love hotel and-- It's okay since you're in the filling-up business. Bastard. But, wait-- Natsuki? What the heck? I test-drove the car with my dad yesterday, you know? This new car had a new tachometer. I didn't know until yesterday. Just imagine, AE86, 250 horsepower. You know how fast 250 hp is? I tried to make a turn at 150 mph. It took me three minutes through the entire Mt. Akina. Amazing, huh? I really want to tell everyone. You... and Natsuki. No need. No need for what? No need to tell Natsuki. Takumi. There's something I want to tell my best mate. Who? -You. -Go ahead. I saw Natsuki. She entered a love hotel with a guy. Love hotel? -Love hotel. -There must be a mistake. It only costs 30,000 yen to bang her. What did you say? 30,000 yen to bang her. Your girl is a whore! -Come again? -What happened? I don't want you to get conned, and you hit me? -Go to hell! -Bastard! Go to hell! What are you guys doing? Bring it on! I've known you since we're seven! Stop it! Stop it! Come on, hit me! Go ahead, hit me! Takumi, stop it! Let's talk! Why are you two fighting? He hit me first! Stop, Takumi! -Calm down. -Let go of me! Come on! -Stop it, boy! -You coward! I said stop! Takumi. Why did you hit him, you jerk? So I'm the jerk? Yeah, I jerk off, too! -Hello? -Hello? It's me. I shouldn't have called your girl a whore. I'm sorry. Did you forget? Today is Saturday. Everyone is waiting for you and your AE86. -Hello. -Hello? -It's me. -What's up? I couldn't reach you for days. I've been in my hometown. I'm boarding the train now. I'll be back tonight. I'm racing in Mt. Akina tonight. Right after I'm done, I'll go see you. No. Why don't I see you tomorrow instead? The train is here. Talk to you later. Natsuki, I really want to see you. Natsuki. I'm glad you stayed with me this past holiday. Did I give you enough money last time? We'd better not see each other anymore after tonight. I don't want to be like this anymore. I don't want to see you again and be reminded of this. All I want is to be with Takumi. -Isn't it too much, broom-head? -Indeed. I know Ryousuke well. I will never lose to the same guy... Shit, I hope I didn't hurt him. Dream on. Look who's talking. Your nose has been bleeding for days. See? Here you go again. Damn. I hope it won't become a monthly routine. What are we still waiting for? Everyone's here already. Are you in a hurry? Give him five more minutes. Who cares if he comes. The race is between you and me. Block the road. The race will begin in five minutes. Wait, a car is coming up. It's the AE86! There weren't so many girls at the races in our days. That's right. Uncles, this is a ladies-only zone. Get lost. He's here! It's coming up. So you've resurrected this piece of junk? Way to go, tofu boy. What happened to the car you crashed into the hill? Tofu boy, you want to go first? No need. Just drive faster, I've got other things to do. -For you. -No need. Ryousuke has something to tell you. Listen. Although Kyouichi is a professional, all professionals have their weaknesses. You don't need to teach me. I'm going to win anyway. -What about me? -I'll beat you, too. The road is clear. We can start anytime. I repeat. We can start anytime. Five, four, three, two, one. All three cars took off at top speed. Kyouichi's E3 is leading, followed by Ryousuke's FC. The AE86 is coming last. They've passed the first bend. Both Ryousuke and Takumi made their best lap time. Everyone's faster in the presence of a professional. What are you doing? That's what we call strategy. The FC is suddenly lagging behind before the tunnel. I wonder what's happened to Ryousuke. The speed is unbelievable. All three cars exceeded 100 kph at the bend just now. The AE86 is waiting for its opportunity. Let's see if it can overtake the E3 at the next bend. Go for it, Takumi! Give it back. What's with you? What? It's a race. Of course we have to shout. Go ahead. Here we go. Overtaken. The E3 leaves a lot of room. Both the FC and AE86 used the gutter to overtake the E3. Let me explain, little girl. In street racing, a common weakness of professionals is to leave some open space when taking a right bend. Go for it, Takumi! Takumi, it's just you and me now. What about the car behind us? I can block it for you. Better watch your own ass. The AE86 and FC both managed to pass a professional. But the E3 is trying to catch up. Although they use different tactics, the FC and AE86 are way too fast entering bends. Catching up is not an easy task. Go for it, Takumi! Go for it, Takumi! Attention, everyone! A vehicle has just taken off from the national park, and is heading up the mountain. A car is coming ahead. Get ready to slow down. Kyouichi is ignoring the warning and is trying to overtake. -Should we block him? -It's too late. The E3 has crashed. -The AE86 and FC passed through. -Damn it! The race goes on. -Is he okay? -Forget him. -Kyouichi, are you okay? -Are you all right? The five consecutive hairpins. Can the FC pass here? The AE86 is at its limit. Now it's my turn. The FC has overtaken the AE86. There's only one kilometer left. I don't think the AE86 can make it. What the heck? I knew it. You knew again? Takumi has never taken the leading position before. Ryousuke's car is powerful but he still followed Takumi. He wanted to learn his moves and then overtake him. -So it's a lost cause for Takumi? -Not necessarily. You've been driving by yourself all these years. You've never competed with anyone. Remember. Don't pay attention to the competition itself. Ignore the other racers. The one you need to beat is yourself. Almost at the finish line. The AE86 hasn't given up. It's still right behind the FC. The FC has missed its lane when entering the bend. Can Ryousuke withstand the pressure from the AE86? The pressure is from the tires. It's retuned to 250 hp but the FC is still too powerful. As time drags on, the tires won't hold up and the car can't go all the way in its drift. So the last two bends are the most crucial in this race. It's here. The finish line is up ahead. The mighty FC absolutely has the edge. The result is quite clear. The FC slows down as he enters the bend. The AE86 is taking the inside lane. Can it overtake? Yeah! The AE86 has won! The AE86 is the ultimate racing god of Mt. Akina! Great! He did it! Yeah! He won! Yeah! Let's hug! I've lost anyway. So, what's your plan now? Nothing. You? I'm going to set up a new race team. Want to join? I don't know. I've got to go. Takumi, I really want you on my team. Sleep on it. We'll see. Takumi! Takumi! Takumi! It's most important to find a world that belongs to us. Life only has meaning when we can find this world. Takumi, I think, for you, this world is racing. So, what's up? You lost or what? Hey! Let's drink to it. Son of a bitch. Itsuki, I'm sorry. Ryousuke, Takumi here. I'd like... to join your race team.
