fault arguments [Music] That's it, sending doctors to file a complaint [Music] hot we only have good information about you you have been a serious student and conscientious doctor why did you resign from the order because I no longer believed in medicine as it is practiced I reproach him for taking himself for a exact science it is unfortunately not there patton most of my ex colleagues want to ignore it and let's act engineers rather than a doctor he considers the human body as a motor and disease like a breakdown I believe this theory not only false but dangerous you have seen I have no theory I think of one thing that all doctors know but have strangely tendency to forget is that the body and mind fanta about all the interactions of one on the other and that we cannot to separate is perfectly banal I have nothing invented I only say the action of the psyche on diseased organs same are lesions has hardly any mines you also claim to be endowed with a special power you claim to emit a called fluid would accommodate me president I must have something that doctors do not have something that we do not acquire in the faculties there again a limit to ascertain a fact is imposed on the patient who heals [Applause] [Music] [Applause] I say I'm summoned as witness and way of you besides with the face that you have you would get used to it rather wrong I'm in prison and the hospital as

me because I was fed up with starving i asked him if he kate moss pendulum ticket who answered me of course not but this kind of antics without impressing him to finally ask him if he thought he had fluid and cynically answered the sick believe it is enough that the word actually presented the diseases believe Mr. President, this is the danger because they believed blindly the tender and turenne assault to renounce medical care he preferred consult others sarah time he almost paid with his life for this credulity whose heating her livelihood I have never taken care of her yet once I beg you to be silent rest that there is not only exercise illegal medicine but fraud and breach of trust shoah was a doctor mr president i know perfectly well that his passes are ineffective thousands of researchers are working in all laboratories in all hospitals around the world the hot line in none of the efforts of medicine and the stupendous results that she gets everyday he's too smart to believe seriously to the nonsense it serves to these patients contrary to what he says he believes in scientific medicine it is only out of interest that he gave up a profession that it is not for me to defend but which I still want to say is too often criticized we are too well in question no mister the prosecutor m en or doctor fr when did you notice that mister andré turenne had an effusion pleural on August 17 is exactly 12 days after lime and cease to give him his care together with yours where he is today he almost died from a perforation of the pleura he currently has purulent

order of physicians i asks for two hundred thousand francs in damages mr president the man in front of you is not a healer like the others and does not have the excuse of ignorance nor that of mysticism lime is smart and calculating nowadays science is king. materialism sorting out the man in the street obediently follows the movement but this rationalization does not satisfy he aspires to once they would like to mystery and paradoxically the prodigious development of the sciences brings it to the credulity after all my style and everything is possible lachaud perfectly understood this

came to tell you the bar the hundreds of others are testing it in letters which appears in the file then my sympathetic opponents would like to tend, we are forced to suffer or die according to the rules and forbid them to heal themselves control and reindeer having respect for the law which borders on cruelty we have nothing against the doctors on the contrary we ask them for their collaboration and he stubbornly refuses we have been offering for years a status of healers which would allow them to work under control medical faculty stubbornly refuses would she be afraid mister
