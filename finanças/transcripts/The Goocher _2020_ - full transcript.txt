(solemn music) (tense music) (solemn music) (laptop beeping) (static crackling) (dramatic music) - I'll kill you, motherfuckers! (laptop beeping) - Wait, wait, hold up, Rita. It's the goddamned laptop. - [Rita] Top secret communication incoming. Press yes to accept. What the hell does that mean? - [Osborne] We won't know till we press yeah. - Oh yeah? All right, I guess that makes sense. - Right? - Well... - Well what? - Press yes! - Oh yeah, yeah, right. (laptop beeps) Hello? - Hello? - Who is this? - This is your covert contact, Agent X. - Okay, but why can't we see you? - Yeah, what's with the gimmicky avatar, dude? - Well, I'm your covert contact. If you saw my face I wouldn't be very covert, now would I? - Can you see us? - Of course. That's the point, Rita. - What's your problem, man? The dude says he's covert. End of discussion. - Bullshit. We need verification. I do believe there's a required password to carry on top-secret conversations over this channel. - Jesus, Rita, will you stop? - Osborne, did you forget our training? We have procedures to follow. Sleeper cell agents ain't supposed to be chattin' it up with unidentified strangers. - Okay, okay, you're right. Sorry, Mr. X, but there are rules. Rules are rules. Rita's right. We gotta ask you for your passcode. - I can see we made the right choice selecting you two for this critical mission. All right, then, are you ready for the password? - Yes, sir. Very well, then, and that being said, I'm sure you're aware that the password requires a countersign from you. Do you have it ready? - Rita, do we have a countersign? - Countersign? Countersign, oh yeah. I moved it about a week ago. - You two do understand that as a sleeper cell for the CIA, you're supposed to be on duty, 24 hours a day, seven days a week? - Yes, sir. Last night was kinda rough. We were up late watching kung-fu movies, knockin' back a few. - You further realize that if you do not have that countersign, I will have to terminate this conversation and set off the self-destruct device in your dwelling. - What self, self-destruct device? - Self-destruct device? What's a self-destruct device? - Look here, X-Man, we weren't informed on any self-destruct device. - [Agent X] It was in your paperwork when you signed up for sleeper cell duty. - Oh hell, man, who reads disclaimers and stipulations? - Oh my dear boy, always read the fine print. The devil is in the details. - Okay, now let me get this straight? Just so we're all on the same page, you're saying if we don't find that countersign, we get self-detonated? - Yes, Rita, if you can't find the proper countersign, I must assume you're enemy agents, and well, we can't risk putting the nation's security in the hands of enemy agents. Osborne, not to make Rita any more nervous, but if she doesn't find it in the next 30 seconds, well, you two guys are going boom boom. - Find it, man. - I'm looking! - Rita, 30 seconds. - Ah! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, I got it! I got it, chill out. - [Osborne] All right. - Call off the fuckin' thing! (static buzzing) - Thank god. I always hate it when they don't have the countersign. You know, it's a horrible thing to kill people in an anonymous fashion with a remote detonator. - No shit. Okay, man, let's do this. (hands clap) - The password is shama-lama-ding-dong. Countersign, please. - Okay. Countersign is shama-lama-ding-dong. - Yeah, X-Man. - Now, now hold on, dude. - That sounds a lot like the password you just gave us. - Yes, clever, huh? What super-secret organization would ever use the word and then the same word for the password and the countersign? Genius. Okay now, let's get down to business. You're both authorized to participate in Operation Goocher. - Goocher? Goocher (chuckles). What's a Goocher? - I am downloading the case file on to your laptop. (static hissing) (solemn music) - [Man] In April of 2000, Anne Marie Cole was taken into the woods, near Cambridge, Ohio and sexually assaulted and murdered. Her killer, a Catholic priest named Timothy Borges, was arrested and found guilty of the murder. - [Interrogator] All right, let's get right down to it. Where were you the night of April 17th, 2000? - Tending to my priestly duties at Saint Henry's Cathedral, of course. - Oh come on, Father, quit wasting my time. It's over. We found Anne's phone in the woods. DNA results indicate that the blood found on the phone isn't just hers. It's yours, too. So tell me again, Father, how did you get those scratches on your arms and your chest? Tell us where Anne's body is. - That depends, whether or not the coyotes found her. - [Interrogator] How 'bout you tryin' to buy your way into the pearly gates and giver her family some peace? How 'bout you show us her body, yourself? We know you like to kill. Are you afraid to die? - Of course not. I know Heavenly Father's gift is coming, on the other side of the veil. - [Interrogator] Have you killed anyone else? - You want to talk about my work some more? - [Interrogator] I do, Father. - I don't remember how many. - [Man] At the trial, it was revealed Borges had a long history of pedophile activity and a collection of child porn and sadomasochistic paraphernalia. There was no doubt of his guilt, as he confessed in a rambling three-hour confession. - This fuckin' guy was a freak, a pervert to the nth degree, a sick fuck. What he did to that girl is beyond comprehension. The whole time he was behind bars, he was talking about this sick, twisted shit. And when we finally beat his ass enough, and I'm tellin' ya, we beat that son of a bitch, he started crying and gave up the goods, real easy. He did it, I'm tellin' you. And he described how he did it in grisly detail. I still can't fucking sleep at night because of that fucker. I hope he dies in fuckin' hell. (solemn music) - [Man] Since the body of Anne Marie Cole could not be located, legends and myths began to take shape. Was the child actually killed? What happened to the pedophile priest and the search team? In the months and years following the murder, local residents began to report sightings of some mysterious woman roaming the woods. Visitors to the area reported being chased by the woman, and in several instances, hikers and travelers went into the woods and were never heard from again. Soon, the term Goocher was used by the locals to describe this ghostly female who snatched people away into the depths of the dark woods. The Goocher was originally an old Indian tale about an evil spirit that sucked the souls out of human beings. Robert Edwards, a physicist, proposed a theory that the Goocher was actually an alien being who was setting up an alien outpost in the woods for an eventual invasion of the planet Earth. Just as Edwards was to present his findings to the National Security Administration, he disappeared. His hotel room was found empty, except for a handful of cryptic notes. These notes have been in the possession of the National Security Administration, for decades. However, even after multiple lawsuits by civil rights organizations, the NSA refuses to comment on Edwards' notes or his fate. More recently, conspiracy theorists have been spreading rumors that the Goocher is no alien or mythical beast. These rumors claim that Anne Marie Cole was not murdered but rather abducted by a secret government organization involved in creating genetically advanced killers, cyber-synthetic organisms designed to be unstoppable in wartime. If this is true, the possible repercussions go well beyond the murder mystery. They go to the heart of war crimes and the abuse of human rights. To this day, the Goocher remains a mystery. Who can say what the real truth is? One can only speculate. (static hisses) - Okay, comments on materials you have just seen, please. - So what happened to the kid and the priest, and where'd you all come up with the name Goocher? - Goocher was the name the locals came up with, over the years, when this thing was spotted in the woods, you know, like Bigfoot. - Bigfoot is real! - I knew it! - Ah! - I knew it! (dramatic music) (tense music) (dramatic music) (gun bangs) - [Landlord] Look, I done gave you two extra weeks to pay your goddamned rent money. Now you got 24 hours before I get the sheriff draggin' your monkey-ass out of there. Now I need my goddamned money. Ain't nobody playin' with you. 24 hours and that's it. (phone ringing) - [Man] Hello, Mrs. Crabtree. This is an encrypted recorded message. As you know, your father died several weeks ago, and this recorded message states the terms of his last will and testament. Your father was a successful man who made millions of dollars. Such men acquire such wealth at high risk and extensive envy and jealousy. In his lifetime, your father named six people who he felt deserved retribution for their transgressions. Massai Petrovich, a Russian conman, Kody Simms, a female who caused your father great emotional scars, Bobby DuVall, the no-good deadbeat who stole copious amounts of money from your father, Reginald Tyree, a crooked cop who lives above the law, Shana Glenn, one of the world's biggest cheats and swindlers, and Macy Reed, whom you know was your father's fiancee. In his will, your father notes that she must suffer to her last breath. The terms of your father's will are simple. You stand to inherit the sum of $250 million. In order to receive this money, you must kill these six people within one week. How you do it and where you do it is up to you. To that end, your father has assigned a team of mercenaries to get the job done and leave no trace. Look for a certified package in the mail, this afternoon. Good luck, Ms. Crabtree. We wish you luck in this venture. Happy hunting. (computer buzzing) (dramatic music) (stun gun crackling) (Macy yells) (stun gun crackling) - What do you mean, Randy, you don't have my money? I gave that money to you, six months ago, with this 50% return in a month is what you told me. And now I haven't heard from you. And now you're in Hawaii. Don't worry about that noise. I got $5,000 worth of beef in the cooler here, trying to keep cold, and I'm talkin' about my money. Hey, who the hell are you guys? What the hell do you want? Ah! (stun gun crackling) (Reginald groaning) - You stay away from me! (strikes thudding) (Shana yelling) - Hey, babe, how are you? No, I'm on my way. I know I'm running late. - [Mercenary] Always running late. - Um, babe, I gotta call you back. Hey, what the hell? What is this? (gun thuds) - Where the fuck are these guys? Where the fuck are you guys at? You guys should've been here by now. Oh shit. (stun gun crackles) - Come here! (Bobby yelling) (stun gun crackling) (strike thuds) (Bobby grunts) - Can I get some service here? (baton thwacks) (baton thudding) Bitch, stop! (Massai grunting) (solemn music) (suspenseful music) (static crackling) (radio warbling) (electronics whining) (suspenseful music) - Man, that was a wild night. (bird squawks) (dramatic music) (phones ringing) (static crackling) - My name is Desiree Crabtree. All of you have, at some point, worked for or know my father, Jericho Crabtree. When he died, last year, his will instructed me to find all of you and bring you here. By now, you have all found a backpack containing food, water and a lot of money. The money is yours to keep, but there is a catch. First of all, you are not alone. This is Logan, Cole and Tina, the centurions. They will be monitoring your every movement. If you try to escape the mountain with the money before you have completed your tasks, they will kill you (laughs), no exceptions. There are six of you, and you have been chosen for a specific reason, a test of will and a lesson in survival, but more on that later. Allow me to introduce all of you to each other. (static crackles) Massai Petrovich, a Russian conman, who cost my father hundreds of thousands of dollars. I know you think he forgot you, Massai, but my father had a long memory. Kody Simms, the girlfriend who latched on to my father and took him for millions of dollars. My father claimed he loved you, but when he found out about your thievery, he wanted you to find out how hard life really is. Bobby DuVall, the accountant who took my father's money and invested it into porno websites and strip clubs. Oh, they all made money, but you helped yourself to $3 million, tax-free cash, that you did not tell my father about. Can you imagine his anger when we found out? Reginald Tyree, the undercover cop who ratted my father out to the feds for his insider trading. My father died in prison. When I used to visit him, he blamed you the most. If I were you, I'd think about that, Reginald. - Shana Glenn, the financial guru who took all of my father's trade secrets and wrote a book about it, claiming them as her own. You've made millions off of my father, and you've been on the run, for years. Prepare for more running, sweetheart. And last, but not least, Macy Reed, the one that got away. My father showered you with gifts and pursued you for years, and you rebuffed him at every instance. When he was rotting in a jail cell, you didn't visit once. All the letters he sent to you, not one answered. You are a heartless bitch. Think of him as you try to survive the next few hours (laughs). Now that we're all acquainted, allow me to explain the situation. The collars around your necks are a tracking device, a control measure and an explosive (giggles). Tampering with the device or trying to escape the marked trails will result in your heads being exploded. This is to ensure you will not try to escape without taking care of a few little items. First, each of you is now an enemy combatant. You must kill everyone else on the way down. There are weapons scattered along the trail. I suggest you find one or more. Makes killing a lot easier. After you kill your opponent, feel free to take their money from their backpack. The winner gets all the money he or she can carry. With that said, I suggest you get a move on. Remember, you are all moving targets. You play the game the right way, the target won't be on your back. Oh, and don't forget your shades (giggles). Happy hunting. - Fuckin' bitch. (eerie music) (dramatic music) (tense music) - [Bobby] Yeah, that'll work. (static crackling) (dramatic music) (Macy panting) - Where are you going, little girl? This is like "Hunger Game." (Massai laughs) And you are no Katniss. (Macy grunting) (hatchet whooshing) (hatchet thuds) (weapons whooshing) - [Reginald] It's mine! (weapons thuds) (Shana grunts) - Surprise, bitch! (Kody yells) (Kody grunting) (blade whooshing) (bat thuds) Oh fuck! - Now that's a surprise! (kick thuds) (Kody grunting) (suspenseful music) (Macy yells) (hammer whooshing) (weapons thudding) (fighters grunting) (hammer thudding) (Macy grunting) (strikes thudding) (Kody grunting) (hatchet whooshing) (Macy gasping) (punches thud) (Kody grunting) (bat thudding) (static crackling) - Okay, Rita, Osborne, big news, we have intel that there is something going on in Cambridge, right now. I'll be sending you both to Cambridge, immediately. We have reports there are civilians in the woods. We have no idea about their purpose, but some of them are armed. We think they may be Soviet agents, there to test the Goocher's capabilities. You are to kill with zero tolerance. Anything or anyone in that zone is to be terminated. Then take out the Goocher. And then nuke the whole fucking site to destroy any traces that fiendish hell beast ever existed. Hold on, you two, we have a drone in the area, and it's sending in images, right now. Watch your screen. (static crackling) (dramatic music) - (gasps) Holy fuck! Did you see that? - Goddamn. Fuck yeah, man. That bitch is off the hook. - That bitch will eat your soul if you don't watch your asses. Okay, get loaded and get to Cambridge. Report in via the provided satellite phones when you arrive. - Yes, sir. - Roger that, sir. (suspenseful music) (object rattling) (dramatic music) (Desiree yells) (suspenseful music) (creature hissing) (dramatic music) (Tina yells) (strikes thudding) (fighters grunting) (Macy panting) - God. - Come here, little girl! - Where the fuck is she? I gotta rest. (sighs) All this fuckin' runnin'. Oh, I gotta see how much money she left. Oh yeah (laughs). (ominous music) (bat thudding) (sparks crackling) (solemn music) (Shana yells) (ominous music) (creature growling) I must've been hearin' things. (Reginald yells) (suspenseful music) (ax thuds) (Macy gasping) (dramatic music) (static crackling) (strikes thudding) (Kody grunting) (dramatic music) - Fucking help me. - Help, help! - Fucking help me! (Bobby yells) Oh fuck! (gun banging) (suspenseful music) - Stay back, get away from me! (Macy gaspinig) Get away, get away! (Macy gasping) (tense music) (Massai grunting) - Massai, I don't know you for shit. But you want some advice? Get out while the gettin's good. - What? So you can blow my fuckin' head off? Fuck you. - Fuck that, man. I'm gettin' out. There's somethin' you gotta know, man. You ever heard of the Goocher? - Who the fuck is Goocher, you crazy bitch? (Massai sighs) (ominous music) (Massai screaming) (dramatic music) (solemn music) (Goocher burps) - Oh fuck. (gun banging) (tense music) (Goocher gasping) (static crackling) - Whoa, whoa, whoa. - [Macy] I don't want to fight anymore. - Yeah, I think the game's over by now. - Did you see that thing? - I saw it. There's a demon eating people's vomit up in here! - Hey! - How should I know? I'm in the same boat as you. - Hey, you two! - Hey, you stay away. - Oh, no, no, no, no. I'm your best hope of getting out of here. - Bullshit! You're with that crazy bitch. - Why should we believe you? - I know what's goin' on here. - Oh, explain. - That demon you're seein', that's my sister. My sister's the Goocher. (both laugh) - Goocher? What the fuck is a Goocher? - Yeah, 20 years ago, my sister was brought by a pedophile priest into these woods and raped and murdered. - What does that have anything to do with a crazy vomit-eating demon? - Her soul went to hell and came back. And now she's murderin' everybody who comes in these woods. - So then we just-- - So we need to hunt her down, and we need to kill her. - And how do you expect us to do that? - Those things around your neck. - And how the hell do you expect us to get 'em off without us blowing to bits? - We'll cut 'em off. (Macy laughs) (Kody sighs) - Oh my god, yes. - Unbelievable. (Kody and Macy laugh) (dramatic music) (ominous music) (static crackling) (creature hissing) - Hey, Goocher! Come on, come on! Come on. (dramatic music) - Come on, bitch, hah! (Goocher gasping) (Kody grunting) (dramatic music) (Goocher screeches) (ominous music) (Macy gasps) (tense music) - Oh my god, oh my god. (suspenseful music) (Macy and Kody grunting) (sticks thudding) (Kody and Macy gagging) - [Goocher] Hello, sister. It's me, Anne Marie. I am not evil. I am just misunderstood. You don't want to kill me. (solemn music) I am your sister. I am not evil. (gun bangs) (Goocher shrieks) (Macy and Kody coughing) - [Macy] Get it, get the thing. (collar beeping) (detonator beeps) (explosion booms) (Kody groans) - Are you okay? - Yeah, yeah (grunts). (fire crackling) (solemn music) (all panting) Are we going the right way? - How the hell am I supposed to know? - Are we going up the mountain? It's freezing. - I think we're lost. - Oh yeah. - I think you're right. - I'm not gonna think about this. (Kody grunts) - Don't move! How the hell did you three get out? Are you part of this thing? - Listen, Crabtree, the plan, it's dead. It's all over. - (scoffs) I know it's dead, Cole, so are Tina and Logan. - Look, we killed that thing. It's dead. We can all get out of here. - Yeah, lady, just, you can put that gun down, anytime you feel like it. - Like hell I will. This is my only means of protection. - We need to get out of these woods and report this to the police. - Not likely, Cole. What do you think the police are gonna do when they find out what's been going on out here? I gotta get rid of all three of you. Now move! - Like hell we will. If you're gonna kill us, you're gonna kill us right out here. - Think this through, Crabtree. Murder carries a heavy charge. - So is kidnapping and false imprisonment. I gotta get rid of you guys. Either you guys move or you die here. (rifle clicks) (rifle bangs) - Whoa! - Jesus Christ! Okay. (zombies growling) (ominous music) (gun banging) - [Cole] Yeah, move! (Desiree yells) (flesh splatting) (zombie growling) (stick thudding) (Kody grunting) (flesh splats) (tense music) (suspenseful music) - Dammit, Cole! Are you even sure if this is the way? - I'm not sure of anything. We should've reached the main road by now. (Kody sighs) - These fucking phones are useless. There's no service or anything. - Look, I'm hungry. I'm tired. We need to find food or water or something. - How long have we been walking? - At least two hours. - Oh my god! What the hell does it matter? I'm starving. - It's going to get dark soon. So we need to find shelter or something and get some rest. (dramatic music) - Hey, look! - [Macy] Where the hell did that come from? - That's the vehicle we came here in, come on. (solemn music) Shit, there's no keys. Crabtree must've taken them. - What the fuck? - Okay, well, we gotta find her. - She could be lost like us, or dead. Kick his ass. (ominous music) (dramatic music) (zombies growling) - All right, you sons of bitches, come and get it (laughs)! (wrench thudding) (sword thwacking) (ninja grunts) (Valarie laughing) (wrench thudding) Hell, yeah! There' ain't nothin' like the smell of dead Goochers! (Valarie sniffs) (Valarie sighs) What are you bitches lookin' at? I just saved your lives. Name is Valarie Jones. I think a thank you's in order. - Thanks so much. - Hey. - No, child. Y'all sure were hungry. How long you girls say you been here? - I'm not sure. We lost track of time. - Yeah, what's up with the sun around here anyway? - Oh well, you're in the Valley of the Sun, a natural bend of the earth, supplemented by global warmin' and the gravitational pull of the sun (laughs). - I've lived in Cambridge my whole life. I've never heard of the Valley of the Sun. - Oh you ain't in Kansas no more, Dorothy (laughs). - Uh, excuse me. - This ain't Cambridge. The devil, he just picked you up and dropped you right here. - Oh yeah. - Hey. What are you saying? - I'm sayin', you better hush your mouth. You need to get food in your belly. We don't know when those Goochers are gonna be back. (Goochers screaming) Oh honey, livin' out here in the wild, you hear things. Most of the time, it's the god's honest truth. It's simple. They used your sister as a prototype for a new killer, a super soldier. - [Cole] What? - Well, the government, they used her for years, worked on her forever. And while these Goochers are killin' everybody, they were just settin' her up to see if she was good to go (laughs). Oh you poor, poor girls, you think it's over? Oh no, it's just the beginning. - The beginning of what? (Valarie laughs) (Valarie screams) (Goochers growling) (dramatic music) (Goocher burps) (Goocher growls) (Macy gasps) - I think we lost 'em. - When is this nightmare going to end? - Don't be a fucking idiot. We're never getting out of here. - Don't say that, Kody. We've got to keep movin', come on. - Why? - Because I'm not gonna die on my knees. I'm gonna go out fighting. So what's it gonna be? - [Macy] Kody, she's right. Come on, we have to keep moving. Let's go. (Kody sighs) (dramatic classical music) - What the fuck is goin' on out here? (Goochers growling) This is my property. Who the fuck authorized you bums to sleep on my property? I'm gonna give you until the count of three to get off of my property, or I'm gonna put bullets into them asses. One, two, all right, ass bullets comin' up. (rifle banging) There, you see, now you're all dead. Had you listened to me, you'd be alive and well, and headed home to your families tonight. But no, now you had to go fuck with Alfred E. Newman. (dramatic classical music) (creature hissing) (solemn music) (tense music) (sword whining) - What are you ladies standin' around gawkin' for? Come on, we got to move. - Oh, why should we? We don't know who you are? - Yeah. - Yeah. - I just saved your life. And I didn't have to. So if you want to live, I suggest you follow me. - I say let's go. (solemn music) - [Woman] Agent X, your two operatives have arrived at the target site. We are monitoring their movements through the use of onsite air technology. Please be advised that there are reports of gunfire and explosions onsite. - Okay, guys, take it easy, just take your time. (suspenseful music) (static crackling) (Goochers hissing) (static crackling) What happened to my picture? What's going on with this thing? (static crackling) (creature hissing) (creature shrieks) - What? (gun banging) (creatures screeching) (Rita yells) (static crackling) Whoa, whoa, whoa. (static crackling) - Tellin' me there's more than one fuckin' Goocher. There's bunches of these fuckin' things. Osborne, where the hell are you, man? Come on! (suspenseful music) (Goochers screeching) (gun banging) (Osborne yells) (Goochers screeching) (static crackling) (Osborne yells) (flesh splatting) (static crackling) I am not takin' the fall for this. Fuck this! - [Woman] Agent X, your authority has been overridden by a government official with high-level clearance. Due to the fact that the agent operatives have been terminated, your operation has also been terminated. No details of your mission can be released to the DOD. Therefore, you, your headquarters and everyone associated with your operation has been marked expendable. - [Agent X] If you honestly think I'm gonna sit here and let you blow me the fuck up, you can fuck yourself. I'm outta here. Later, bitch. - [Woman] Thank you for your service to our nation. Goodbye, Agent X. (computer beeping) (explosion booms) (dramatic music) (women panting) - You bitches are out of shape. Take these blankets before you freeze to death. - Look, we've been running for miles. Will you please tell us what's going on? - (sighs) Yeah, well, in the 1950s, they were running nuclear tests up in these parts, like underground atomic explosions. Now these assholes actually thought that they could wash off the radiation with the salts from the bath salts up in the woods. - [Narrator] You will need a good shelter and a two-week supply of food and water and other living essentials. If you have them ready and learn a few safety precautions, you and your family stand a first-rate chance of surviving any nuclear attack. (ninja sighs) - They were wrong. So those unlucky souls that worked for the Army, they all got radiation poisoning. - Hey, I remember those old movies. They used to set off bombs and send in troops into the blast zone to simulate Army maneuvers. (explosion roars) - Yeah, pretty stupid. Anyway, Dr. Briggstone was in charge of the whole operation, and when her (laughs) workers started droppin' like flies, they buried the bodies up here, in these parts, to keep it a secret. Now when you ladies came along and blew up the Goocher, she resurrected those dead motherfuckers and made more Goochers. (Macy sighs) - Oh really? My sister was the Goocher, smart guy. So I think your story is bullshit. - Oh, right. Well, let me get you up to speed. Your sister was possessed by an ancient Indian spirit, the original Goocher. - Well, my sister was fine until she was raped and murdered. - Look, tell yourself whatever you need to sleep at night. Fact of the matter remains is that the original Goocher would suck the soul out of his victims. So all that white vomity shit that you see them spittin' up, it's actually their soul being sucked out. Now these new Goochers that you ladies done ran off and created, they don't believe in sucking things. They eat and chew your entire soul. They actually take their victims and chew up every single part of their body to absorb their whole being. - So now that you've scared us shitless, how the hell are we supposed to kill them? - Oh, that, my dear, is simple. You have to chop them up, nice and clean, you know, like you butcher a dog. - Okay, fuck you and the horse you rode in on. You're insane. - Yeah, get serious. This is absolutely ridiculous. We cannot do this. - There's some weapons for you. You can choose that. I really don't care what you do, because listen to this, I've been alone. I've had to watch out for nobody but myself and worry about myself. I saved you as a courtesy. So you can do what you want to do. - Okay. (solemn music) - Now come on, ladies, and get your game faces on. Choose your weapon. And you get a bat. - A bat? Why don't I get an ax like them? - [Abraham] Because someone's got to knock 'em down while they cut 'em up. - (laughs) What? That's bullshit. - Well, it's either you can go out there with your bare hands to try to knock 'em down. They're not gonna wait their turn in line to be cut up. - Someone has to do it. - Why-- - And it might as well be you. - [Cole] Come on, just take the bat. - Fantastic. - (coughs) Excuse me, but, uh, who exactly are you assholes? - Well, who the fuck are you? - I believe I asked first. - Look, man, we're in the middle of a Goocher holocaust, and we're about to go out there and take care of that. - I don't care about any Goocher holocaust. You see this line right here. That's my property line. - What do you mean it's your property line? - I'm Alfred E. Newman of the Kennebunkport Newmans. I'm sure you've heard of 'em. - Not really. - No. - We're rich. We're famous. - Now that don't mean nothin'. (women laughing) - And at this point, you're too damn close. You need to take these young ladies. You need to go on down the road before I fill thine asses full of bullets. - Look, man, we have an epidemic of creatures comin' around here, and they don't give a damn whose property it is. And when they come down there, hell's comin' with 'em. (gun banging) (Goochers growling) - What the fuck? - See, what'd I tell ya? (dramatic music) All right, ladies, let's knuckle up, let's go! - Let's do this. - Do this. (gun banging) (Goochers yelling) (weapons thudding) (fighters grunting) (gun banging) (gun clicks) - Shit, I'm outta bullets. (weapons thudding) (fighters grunting) - All right, come on, you sons of bitches. (ninja hisses) (sword whining) (bat thuds) (Kody grunting) (sword whining) (ninja grunting) - Come on, who's next? (weapons thudding) (fighters grunting) (dramatic music) (sword whining) (weapons thudding) (fighters grunting) I see you, bitch. (sword whines) (solemn music) (gun banging) - Now that's how you enforce property laws. - Dude, they're already fuckin' dead. - Yeah, they are now. - Whatever. Crazy son of a bitch. - You still back there, Hollywood? - How dare you? - [Ninja] Shh! - You can stop right there. - Who the fuck are you guys? - I'm Dr. Fouler. How long have you guys been out here? - We were taken here to kill each other, and then all shit went crazy. Look, we're tired and we're hungry. Can we just get out of here? - All in good time. Five of you? Five of you, and all I see is a sea of dead hooligans, and yet the five of you are still here standing. - [Macy] Hooligans, those are Goochers. - [Abraham] Goochers? - That's right. They tried to eat us. - You know, soul-suckin' demons. Look around, they're everywhere. - Well, what does it matter? They're dead. - Yeah. - We need to get out of these woods. We're cold, and we're hungry, and we're pissed, so if you'd just move, we'd like to get out of here. - What more do you know about these Goochers? - [Ninja] We know that you have to cut 'em up. - Just that they tried to kill us and that my sister was the original Goocher. (dramatic music) - Very nice. - Why are we talking about this? - [Cole] Yeah. - Very good. - What's so funny? - Apprehend them. - Hey! - Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hold it! - Let go of me! - Ow, ow! - [Alfred] Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! I'm a Newman! (tense music) (dramatic music) - [Abraham] Ms. Cole. - Who are you? Where am I? - [Abraham] You really don't remember me? - Should I? - Well, first off, welcome back. Now I'm gonna ask you the same question I've been asking everybody else, 'cause I keep finding this answer quite fascinating. How long do you think you've been here? - Couple days. - [Abraham] It's been a little over three months. - You're crazy. - [Abraham] Oh, I'm crazy? - Yeah, you must be. - [Abraham] That's rich, coming from you. - What's that supposed to mean? - When you were picked up, I hear the same thing about you that I get from everybody else. You're rambling on about your sister. - Yes, Anne. - Who has been gone for 16 years now. - Yeah, she was murdered. - But why now? - 'Cause she came back and tried to kill us. - [Abraham] Really? Alone? - Yeah. - [Abraham] Are you sure that it was just one Goocher? - I'm positive. You weren't there. I was. (Abraham laughs) - [Abraham] Now tell me a little more about Timothy Borges. Has he come to your mind lately? - Why would he? He's a freak. He murdered her. - [Abraham] Have you had any visions lately about him or your sister, by any chance? - No. - Sure. Now I'm gonna warn you now. This isn't going to tickle you. (phone beeps) (collar crackling) (Cole moaning) (dramatic music) Good afternoon, Kody. - Hey, man, what's going on? - [Abraham] Don't worry about that. - I am worried about it. - [Abraham] You shouldn't be. - I need to go. - You'll be out as soon as we're done here, Kody. Now the first question I have for you-- - No, no, I don't wanna answer any questions. You've got the wrong person here. I need to go. And what the hell is this? - [Abraham] (laughs) A safety precaution. - Safe for who? - For me. Now back to my questions. How long do you think you've been here? - A couple days. - [Abraham] You've actually been missing for three months. - Bullshit. - [Abraham] Do you have a recollection of April of 2000? - [Kody] Sure, I was alive. - Smart-ass. Good enough for me. Does the name Timothy Borges mean anything to you? - [Kody] I have never heard of him. - When you were being picked up, you were completely delusional. All that could made out from your ramblings was the name Anne. Who was Anne to you? - Dude, I've never met anyone named Anne in my entire life. (solemn music) - Good enough for me. - [Kody] Does that mean I can go? (phone beeps) - Sure. - No! (collar crackling) (Kody shrieking) (Kody coughing) No, no, get off of me! No! (Kody grunts) - We're done here. (dramatic music) Good afternoon, Macy. My name is Dr. Abraham Fouler. Can you tell me why you're here? (tense music) (heartbeat thumping) My name is Dr. Abraham Fouler. (dramatic music) My name is Dr. Abraham Fouler. My name is Dr. Abraham Fouler. My name is, my name is Dr. Abraham Fouler. My name is Dr. Abraham Fouler. My name is Dr. Abraham Fouler. - We were brought here for our injuries after the explosion and everything that happened, but I don't know why I still have to stay here and what this thing is doing back on my neck. - Don't worry about that. That's more of a safety precaution for us. From what the rescue team relayed to my office and what I have here in my notes, you say that you were with two other survivors, a Cole and Kody. Can you tell me a little more about them? - (sighs) Well, Kody and I were thrown into the woods to kill each other, and Cole was there to make sure we didn't escape. - First off, Macy, I must say it's truly remarkable that you are still alive. You said in your statement to the police here that you were stranded in the woods for at least two days. I called the library where you worked, and they filed a missing persons report about three months ago. (dramatic music) - What are you talking about? - I understand that it may be hard for you to comprehend at this time. Dehydration and starvation can definitely cause a loss of the concept of time and possibly hallucinations. But we will return to that. I would like to learn a little more about you, Macy. Can you tell me a little more about your parents' death? (Macy gasping) - What does that have to do with this? - [Abraham] Your parents, from what I've learned from your file, your parents were killed in a car crash, 10 years ago. How do you feel about that, such a young age? - I don't want to talk about that. - [Abraham] You were so young. No child should ever have to bear that pain. Your mind was still developing, and a traumatic experience like that can then have an unbearable and negative effect on such a young mind. A part of me believes that you blame yourself for this demise. Is this true? (solemn music) You can't blame yourself for fate. There was nothing you could've done to change the outcome of what happened. In fact, this may sound blunt, but I think your parents were meant to die, right then and there. In fact, I feel that their deaths have made you into the person you are today. You're strong and independent, and obviously, nothing can get in your way from surviving what life throws at you. You survived in the woods on your own, for just a little over three months. You came in covered in blood and wailing that you had survived. You survived the horrors. - We did survive. We got away from that thing. - That thing. Can you tell me what you know about the Goocher? - I didn't even tell you the name. What, what do you mean-- - Just answer the question, Macy. The Goochers. - Well, all-- - What do you know about them? - The only thing that Cole told us was that she was her sister, at one time, and she was raped and murdered, and now she's come back to life to kill us all. - I'm done with the games. (phone beeps) (collar crackling) (Macy coughing) (Macy gasping) (solemn music) Tell your master, when I see him again, and I know you will, that Dr. Fouler is coming for him and that even through death, nothing will stop me, and he will not escape my grasp, not this time. (dramatic music) (static crackling) - [Lana] Well, Fouler, I hear you have excellent candidates. - Well, without your financial contributions for the past 20 years, none of this would've been possible. - The United States government has spent millions developing this new urban warfare weapon. Why, in no time, we'll eliminate poverty in outlying rural areas and have them cleaned up. - Yes, ma'am, and the Goocher Tactical Force is set and ready to go in the regions you've specified. - Then we'll move into the big cities, Philadelphia, Chicago, Atlanta and New York, rid the world of the scum that is bleeding the good, clean people of this country dry. No more welfare, public-assisted Medicare (chuckle) or food pantries. - Wiping the slate clean. - (sighs) Now tell me, will these three provide the DNA needed to expand our Goocher army? - Well, we were lucky enough to intercept the plans of Ms. Crabtree and her team, who happened to show up right around the same time we were about to launch. - Fuck Crabtree. The stupid bitch didn't realize she was sacrificing her life for the good of science and national security. Now tell me about these girls. - Kody is young and feisty. Her DNA is perfect for the drive of the Goocher. - Feisty, I do like them feisty. Feisty bitches rock, Fouler. - (laughs) Yes, ma'am. Now we move on to Cole, who's the younger sister of the original Goocher. Unfortunately, her DNA isn't nearly as strong, but her traits are as close as we've come. - Nothing like sibling rivalry. This bitch better prove herself. - (chuckles) Oh, she will. If not, I'll have to break her myself. - Now, tell me about this Macy. - Ah, Macy, she's quite the peach, zesty and rough and tough, willing to kill any dead scum that gets in her way. - Good. - I like her a lot, Ms. Bridgewater. I like her a lot. Now who's going to be the male specimen when it comes to the Goocher children? (Lana chuckles) Ah, I see. Well, it'll be my pleasure, Ms. Bridgewater. - Of course it would be a pleasure. I knew you were a little freaky, Fouler. Just make sure you're inseminating these bitches with medical instruments and not your own personal sperm pump. - Now, Ms. Bridgewater, I'll have you know I am a professional. - Oh, spare me, Fouler. I saw those surveillance tapes from some of your earlier professional work on this project, 25 women impregnated and not a single Goocher to show for it. You're lucky you didn't catch something, doin' all that professional work. - Now, Ms. Bridgewater-- - Oh, for fuck's sake, Fouler, forget it. You're a man. You do what men do. Now tell me about this fourth prototype. (solemn music) You said there was a fourth prototype. Hey. (hands clap) Fouler! - Four, isn't four just such a lovely number? It suits you so well. - What the fuck are you-- (electricity crackling) (Lana yells) (Lana gasping) (eerie music) (static crackling) (dramatic music) (static crackling) (ominous music) - Hi. (solemn music) - Macy, you are the key. Macy (laughs). - [Macy] Who is it? What do I do? - [Cole] Macy, you are the key. (dramatic music) (creature growls) (solemn music) (ominous music) (woman screams) (static crackling) (solemn music)
