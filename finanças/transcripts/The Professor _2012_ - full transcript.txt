It is about culture. Sorry miss, come back next session, but prepared. That shithead, he let me fail for the third time. But how can one know all that bullshit. What's in his mind? He does it on purpose, I realized that. It'll work out Robby. But didn't you hear what absurd questions he asks just see me struggle? Only 'cause I didn't spread my legs. Calm down, Robby. I will never pass that exam, bastard. And how can I tell my mother. So much for a vacation in California! But who cares, I have other things to do in life. But I'll make him pay, I swear. - Thank you. - Thank you. Did you see who was there? And like the bastard he even pretended not to see me. Let's leave. His mere presence gets on my nerves. But firm Sir, what do I bring you? Yes, please bring me some ham and a drink? Is this enough for me? Thank you, Thank you. Be forewarned. No, no. Thank you. Thank you. Hello. If the themes. Sorry, honey, but I have to go. I have to go serious problems. Can you please call a cab for my fianc?e? Of course not, thank you. Here it is, gentlemen. Excuse me miss, do you want the cab now? - No, I will warn her. - Bens. Good evening professor. - Good evening to. - Te Roberta. Roberta Gastaldi. - Ah yes, I never remember the names. - How come here all alone? Wait, maybe someone. No, I simply came to have dinner. Meanwhile, it concerns me with a thesis. One does not expect to find someone like you without company. - Yet. - Yet it happens. Well, I was still glad to see you in a foreign environment. To that of the university. - Do you want to send me away already? - No, no, Why can I sit down? Of course. But is he your boyfriend? Hi honey. Oh, I'm sorry. Yes, I'm going in a little while. Kiss. Love. You know, you have beautiful wrinkles on your forehead. You are a fascinating man. Who? Me? You? Do you feel it? Going home. If you want, I will accompany you. No need. He lives 200 meters away. - But I can walk with you. - But I don't want to go home ha. You have met her. Do you remember my mother when she took the short degree exam? Wasting no time, I told her that her daughter had been caught. Mouthing lip service to one of his comrades. In the university bathrooms. I certainly did not tell her that. Whatever, I would have gone around it, but my mother is not dumb. Do you remember my mother or not? Oh yes, now that you've told me the fact. Yes, yes, I remember it now. Because you needed someone to bring it back to your mind. Well, you certainly can't forget. This is the third time you have failed your daughter. Sorry. Do you still desire something? A white martini? Thank you. Can you get me a coffee? Thank you. So, dear Professor Julius, we were saying. That time my mother made such a face at me. at the university everyone was talking about that truth mouthpiece. That when they told you about it the urge came to you, too. Of having me take it in your mouth. Well, I wasn't bad before, but now I've gained some experience. Roberta Look, couldn't we change the subject? And why professor? However, my mom passes right away, also because shortly thereafter. Father would pass away. - I miss my father very much. - You are welcome. - You are welcome. - Thank you. Here's the coffee. Thank you. Do you need anything else? No, not at the moment. I was very attached to him, maybe too much so. He thinks I still keep the suit he wore the day he died. But why do you go into these details? Roberta? And because of that I want to live every moment of my life intensely. Yes, even with a cock in his mouth. But I don't want to lose a single second. However, if this at the university gave rise to a certain idea. And do you think I give a damn, being called a cocksucker? But don't make me laugh. It was certainly not I who spread these rumors. Ah, no, it wasn't you. No. Absolutely. I'm not used to it. But he goes and blows people away. However, in the end it is not hearsay. What they say is true. I like dick a lot. Roberto but don't talk like that. You are a pleasant person. Here, Giulio, is the tone of the frustrated professor. He'd lecture us with integrity in the classroom and then run home to jerk off, thinking about what he had glimpsed between my legs. Well, if he had given me a call, I would have given you a hand. I got sleepy. I think I will go home and sleep. No, we have to end this talk now. - What did you want to say? - On what? When you said I was peeking under the pews? But Julius, didn't you notice that every time you passed my desk. Or you would stand near the desk to get a better look at me, spread his legs wide on purpose. And you didn't notice that when I had class with you I always put on the shortest miniskirts and sometimes even without panties. As a department head. Now I have nothing underneath. Well, at least you've noticed that, I hope. Unfortunately, no. They are quite myopic. - But are you really a loser? - Do you desire anything else? - The bill? - Thank you for everything. Two tables and two tables. All right, thank you. Because he came here tonight for me. Perhaps, since he was waiting for no one, he felt like. Oh, professor, I was calling you a she. Did you perhaps feel like looking between my legs? You will go home. Masturbate. Gentlemen the bill. Thanks to you, I am paying for it. My fianc? left me the money to pay. Does she have to pay, tonight's boyfriend? Yes, my boyfriend tonight. And then tonight the pleasure was mine. Thank you miss. Of course, having a blowjob specialist like you at your disposal I should have taken better advantage of the opportunity. But it depends on the opportunities. If that's why you gave it to me tonight by eating that cake. There wasn't much imagination to work with. Then make your imagination work later. When you are in your monk's bed. For. See you again, Professor, who simply followed you. I liked you tonight. A great frustrator under a respectable facade. And pissed more at himself than at me. Well, I believe that. Self-repression makes one unhappy in the long run. Hysterics. As for me, that's the way I am. I like assholes. And you in the university, especially with me, you are a big jerk. - So shut up for a moment. - No, no. Eh. Eh. Hello love, are you still on the road? No, I watch some TV and then to sleep. Until tomorrow I'll think of you. Sounds, words, vocabulary without much meaning. You see Julius, it takes very little. Luca is quiet and we have no one to bother us. Tonight it's just you and me. Come, Giulio, come near me or are you afraid? Listen to Julius. Luca, my fianc?, is an obnoxious man. Do you take it off? No, it is not, it is simply useless, rich, aristocratic, but it is against the rules. Robert It is good if you were more unbearable, Then you will wonder why he is together. I've wondered about that myself. No obligation, no interest, financial or otherwise. I don't know. I became thirsty, offering me nothing. Yes, but I'll go. Tell me where the refrigerator is? The. - Do you have anything in particular? - No, any soda will do. - But the don't have it. - Yes, but I don't keep it in the kitchen. Where is Xavier? But I am teetotal and only for guests. You will see that it will be good for you. Look, I'm sorry Roberta, if I was a little vulgar earlier in the restaurant. You were vulgar, I didn't notice. But whatever, come on, now don't be like my boyfriend. Tonight it's just you and me. The rest is nothing. I'll help you. Oh, sorry. Oh. Sorry, I didn't do it on purpose. Wait for me to help you. He placed. Drink. I should go home and study. - But at this time. - Are you kidding me? Tomorrow an exam with you forgot. Ah yes, yes, I didn't notice your name in the list of examinees. The list of examinees. Great! Well, what is there to mock? - Rather, are you prepared? - No, not at all. That's why I have to go home and study or else. Mmm. Look at me, do you like me or not? How could people not like you. Of course. You know, I'd like to get at least a boob job. - What do you think? - Well, if it makes you feel more confident. Good Julius, it would make me feel safer. But I already have a strong point. See. - You noticed that, huh? - Yes, of course. Do you know how many men would like to do that to me? And also some women? - I have no doubt. - And you would like to do that to me, huh? He doesn't have the courage to tell me. That's why you failed me. Why didn't I give it to you? Calm down, Giulio, calm down. I feel it as desire. Why did I decide to be a professor? Makes you feel more important, huh? Prompt. Hi Antonella. I am with Professor Giannelli. No, really no, Don't you believe it? Let me pass it on. Come on, Giulio is my friend Antonella Stefani, she is helping me. Revising for the exam. Hello? Yes, yes, yes, that's me. I met her friend by chance at the restaurant. Yes, I was just giving you some suggestions. Yes, yes, thank you. Thank you. I'll review Ms. Castaldi. - I'll slam you. - Out. Of course they are at his house outside. Wait Antonella, I'll embroider you, wait. Are you crazy? Do you want to leave me bruised? - I could also say. - What? Nothing, just kidding. You don't think I'm one of those blackmailers, do you? - You have music. - And there. Here, but come on listen to this crap. All right, come on, I like these, they are not new though. This piece. I remember it because I made my first mouthpiece. I must have been 12 years old at the end of my neighbor. He was always just a father, divorced, and a policeman to boot, always on duty. We used to play doctor and the doctor, or rather the lady doctor. I often made it myself. Because even then I wanted to decide how the game should go. I liked it. He was a year older than me. He was acting as my guinea pig. I would ask him if he preferred it that way, with a faster tongue. Or with more saliva. I learned as you say. You know Giulio, tonight you may have missed the opportunity. Of a sublime experience. This is who has. How nice I can turn them on. You like it, don't you? You don't think I have a nicer ass than I do, do you? See. Then touch. Feel how firm it is. Julius comes here. These movies give me anxiety. Come close to me and. Then you don't have to bother me anymore. Giulio But where are you? No, I will never do that. I forget. What Jesus comes here, he comes close to me. Why do you take me for one of those kids who lose their minds. just because you take it in his mouth in school toilets? Fuck you! Yes, it is true, they lose their heads. You would like me to give you a mouthpiece here now, but I won't. And do you know why? Why do you disgust me? - Yes, you disgust me. - Congratulations. - I disgust you, huh? - That's right. You disgust me. But fuck you dumbass. Sorry, forgive me, I won't do it again. Sorry Roberta, but aren't you normal? And the balance in you seems to me to be nonexistent. But it's not like it helps you with anything. But hear this to help you with something. How dare you? But do you think you are charming? You think all your female students are dying for it. To be fucked by you? Is that so? Do you think so? But what does that have to do with it? Professor Giannelli, the charming professor who makes wet. All females in the school. But fuck you, Professor Giannelli. Come on, come here, come here, come on. Because you also took off your shoes. Daje Roberta, stop it now! I now call a cab. And I'll send you home goodie goodie please, no fuss eh? I go home if and when I want to. And understand professor? No come on Giuli, come here. You're quite a handful though, huh? Giulio Look here, look at me! I can't believe it! Are you shy? Professor Newspaper is ashamed! Go, Julius Listen. Feel how firm. Hot, hot for you. Too bad I didn't know I was meeting you tonight. Otherwise I would have equipped myself. I have a great Garnier. All lace with a garter belt that would make even a dead man's dick pull. And you didn't die, did you? Mmmmh, you look pretty alive to me. He thinks one day he used it to take the exam with Professor Draghi. But what? Duh! What a pierno! I took the exam like this under stones and over a skirt. With the split you'll be able to imagine. Occasionally I would even open my legs, and the professor held me quite a bit under scrutiny, but it's basically redone my whole place. He asked the questions and gave himself the answers. It was a fantastic exam. Had he done him a little service I would have gotten a 30 with honors, but instead I was. Had to settle for only 28. Good thing he's content to watch. And I didn't know shit about anything. What about you? You, Giulio. All you need to do is look. Ask me whatever you want. I won't say no. You like it, don't you? Would you like to do it to me? Me lying down? What about you taking me from behind? Eh, sorry a personal phone call. Hello love. No, I watch some TV, and you came home instead. Oh, poor baby! All right, all right. - Yes, love, yes. - Ah. But what are you doing up there? Yes, yes, I do. Roberta. - What are they? - Were they? - They were my wife's. - Your wife's. Yes, sometimes we played a little differently. She was my accomplice. More than complicit. She was as depraved as you. Depraved to put on high heels. And a waist cincher. You are too young, you cannot know. That that was the fashion in the 1950s. Tighten it up. Waist enhanced the hips and breasts. The women all wanted to be major. Yes, whatever, you are right. Lick my feet, you fucking professor. That's what sends you into a tailspin, huh? It's all yours now. Professor Giannelli is a fetishist. Did you think you were funny, Robert? And you think you were funny? You were sending me three times telling me to go back to asshole. For that matter, this weakness of yours intrigues me. What are you waiting for prof to drool over your young student's little feet? Lick fucking professor. Ah, Roberta, you are beautiful from head to toe. No man will ever overcome a woman's tongue. I like to have it licked. And you, on the other hand, come on, tell me about some of your homosexual experiences. - But I never had any. - Is this true? Come on, tell about you will definitely be one of those. That evening makes the rounds of trans people. Isn't it? Go to hell. What do you say? Zani Giulio Scherzo. MM Well. I want to tell you something you don't know how close you came. I must have been 18 19 years old and still living with my mother. My father had died very recently. He had left us loaded with debt because he was a gambler and. He had lost everything. The only thing we had left was this very large house in which we lived, So great that my mother, to make ends meet, He decided to rent some rooms. And one night one of the tenants came home with a transvestite. It is not that I had never heard of it, however, so close up I had never seen it. And it made me curious. So that night my mother went to sleep out with her new partner, I took his car and started driving around the city, the streets of the city, until I ran into a very young transvestite. An FB. Female sweetest. As you women should be, as real women should be, Who are often much less so than they are. This explains the success of trans people. Whatever, anyway, I talked with him until he convinced me. Coming to my house he had brought a bottle of sparkling wine with him. When we arrived home, she stripped off her clothes completely. And he spilled it all over his naked body. Then he invited me to lick him all over. Which I did. But when I got close to sex, though. It failed, and at that moment I felt very incomplete. See. Bisexuality is true wholeness. In fact I think the true fetishist is an aesthete. That made room for, indeed indulged her feminine side, However, without going any further, Without going as far as bisexuality. He stopped somewhere along the way. Therefore. I believe that completeness has been lacking. And I still feel that I am incomplete. No wonder you devoted yourself completely to women. Women are better, Giulio, admit it. If they are then made like me. Now take this stuff away from me. Shame to remove them. They look so good on you. You have a great desire to bang me. Perhaps you want to encourage me? Tell me, Xavier. So you can finally satisfy your desire for bisexuality. You don't have the courage to admit. What do you say? I don't run away with my students. Ah no, it's Roberta! Do you slant us? Francesca Corkscrew? Do you want me to go on? Ha. Julius women talk blablabla. Actually, to hear their speeches, you seem like a very interesting and different man. That's why you intrigue me. But what do you want to do? Do you think I like old farts like you? Maybe it will be able to work with geese, maybe a few fucks you may have begged from them. With the poor naive ones, but I need fresh hard cocks. When Primate embraced he felt nothing. Actually no, maybe a mushy worm is. But I don't care. Thank you professor. In heels. I come out better read. Also, don't say you don't like me. Do you have anything to drink? To me it all fits here, so it's more comfortable. Look, I would rather you leave. Oh, my little one is offended. Your baby has been bad. I didn't mean to offend you. But what do you do? It will mean that if you don't leave, I'll leave. But where are you going? Come here for five minutes and I'll leave, I promise. Do you know that I have an exam tomorrow? I have to go home and study. My lecturer is really strict. He won't let one pass me by. Unless. Less than what? Why don't we continue what we have already started? Roberta Why are you acting like this? You tease me, you provoke me, you offend me. But what do you really want from me? Look, I'll give you five minutes to leave. And you didn't humiliate me. Come back to the next session, Ms. Gastaldi. Piece of shit. But now I don't feel like talking about that. And I now want to keep it all the way through. Don't ask me any more questions. I am here fuck me! I am like a male in this. I prefer facts to romance. A beautiful bird going up and down is unparalleled. Oh. Roberta, are you drunk? - The five minutes are up. - Mmmmh. Ha. But do you want to use it or not? What do you need it for if not? Hmm when I want to come on, I'm going home now. I would light a cigarette first, please. You have to keep your promise, though. All right. You're keeping it this time, huh? Fuck do you have any Havanas for me to try? 1 Julio. But only I care. Is there? Tell me. I want to please you. They are very strong. Safe. Do you want to try? Magnificent. I'm going to be repetitive, but it feels like having a cock in your mouth. But do you have it bigger than that? Wonderful. I'd like you to put me straight in the ass now. To the point of screaming. You feel it. Are you capable of a stellar performance? Look Roberta, I can't take this play anymore. - I am living a drama. - Huh? What on earth could have happened to you? Come on! - I'm going to die. - But stop teasing me. Instead, that is exactly what it is. - I was diagnosed with cancer. - Where. Pancreas three months ago. They gave me six months to live. Tell you give me? Tonight I'll stay and sleep with you. Do you want to? I don't need a caregiver. Not now. I will try to finish my work as long as illness permits. Also. The little time I have left. I would like it to be simple, clean, right? Listen to Roberta. About ten years ago. There is an election. I was not as busy then as I am now. They call me to be a polling place president. Colleagues introduce me to the tellers. And among them is a woman who must have been twenty-one years old. about your age. No, he hardly uttered a word. He must have hardly said only Ah, I don't even remember. At one point. In making this mechanical gesture of handing over the ballots, I notice that she is leaning on me with one leg and crawling against me. Once, twice, three times. At first I think it's a case. Then the thing is repeated. I liked the girl. And at this point I almost feel authorized to reciprocate this gesture. And I slowly extend my hand. And I start slipping it under her skirt, being careful not to touch the skin, only going up along the fabric. In fact, standing far enough away from the skin to see if there were any. Of negative reactions from him. In doing this I was invaded by excitement. Growing. As I made this gesture, I didn't know whether at any moment. This one had reacted and made me maybe look bad. in front of everyone, and that would have been really serious. However, she continued undaunted in her task. At one point I thought I'll take courage, count to six. And how is it going, is it going? You're kind of in that situation where men are with a woman. That they don't know what reactions it might have, because there is always a boundary very confused between lawful and unlawful, that is, the one that lets you do. And what it forbids you to do. However, my heart was pounding in my throat, I felt like a drum roll. Tremendous excitement. I looked at her with incredible intensity, and at one point. I counted to six. My hand went up decisively and reached up to her buttocks. Smooth as a peach. A wonderful thing. At that moment I was in the 7th heaven, really. - Also. - See, Roberta. You want to get to the ending. But the most, most beautiful, most important, most vibrant part. I had already experienced it. Afterwards yes, in the bathroom we actually made love. But the part that had involved me the most had already passed. - Go ahead. - There is little to say. After that I never saw her again. But as you can see it has remained firmly lodged in my head. Are you romantic, Giulio? It brings to mind. A poem by Leopardi that Professor Cavani liked very much. - Village Saturday. - Yes. Your own morality. Saturday is better than Sunday. I, on the other hand, am different. Julius. I like dick, I just want to feel myself being pounded by something hard. I like Sundays. That's why earlier. I would have liked to get to the point after the feet. Not bad, huh? But Giulio, I am sorry for what is really happening to you. I saw some peaches in syrup from the. - You want some. - No, thank you, I can't. Good mmmmmm. - Are you married? - Hmm. Good question. I don't know. Eh. I'm with a friend, but Mom is only moon. I should stop treating myself like a child. Ouch, you're so annoying! But I'm sorry, but what do you mean by that? But does this seem like the time to talk about something like this? Ah, we can't talk about it at home afterwards, can we? Come on mom. Give later Bye. You like. So do you like them or not? They are arousing, turning you on like the slutty teller. Or do you not feel your heart in your throat? Ami prefer live? Come here. Do you want to fuck me? Come on, don't get into trouble. Roberta. Roberta. Roberta I am here. But what do you do? The shy and self-righteous baton? Have you never seen a woman pee? Come on, come here, come and feel how my pee is flowing. Feel how warm it is. Does MM see that you're a pervert underneath that composed facade? You are a pig, professor. I like pigs a lot. Roberta I'm sick of you now heels up. Quiet. Julius calm, What did you want him to do in your mouth? Come on, just kidding. I expressed a wish, not an order. If you don't feel like it, come by and say no. Us. Julius. Giulio, what do you have? Tell me something, please. Don't worry, though, just get me the tablets. That are on the cabinet up there. - They are these. - Yes. Give me one. But what are they for? Can you smell my perfume? Look, I am already ready. Look Roberta, my condition allows me at least this much. To decide if and not when. And you want true you want? Can you smell my perfume? Do you like my perfume? I'll take care of you, Giulio. Do you know, Giulio, that I had an abortion when? About a year ago. I met a guy at the party of Sonia, a friend of mine. That evening, Sonia, who was supposed to drive home. He had been drinking. He offers to replace Sonia. I agreed, and on the way he stopped at a lay-by and. But did he rape you? No, Julius, let's say he doesn't accept right away, but he also didn't allow him. To get tired of asking. Let's have total sex. The next day even my father noticed. I couldn't even sit down. She became pregnant. I couldn't keep it. I couldn't even remember his name. - Never seen again. - So what? Then he begins to have sudden, unwarranted nausea. But then. I completely lost my appetite. My cycle didn't add up, and I had to figure it out. It's not like it took much to figure that out. Anyway, I thought about it for a while. - For what. - Whether to keep it or not. You didn't expect that, did you? You know Giulio, what would I like? What. That you this night. I would get pregnant. So even when you are gone, something of you will live on. Do you think you would be able to see it? To pass the baton to him? I don't think so. This disease will never give me the time. But at least you would have time to see it grow inside me, Of feeling it is yours. By doing that, you make me go back in time. My grandfather used to hold me like this. He looks a little like my grandfather, you know. I was tiny little and he lifted me from behind with his strong peasant arms, swinging me from right to left and back again, Was trying to scare me. Now I'm going to drop you, he said. Then he would burst out laughing and a big kiss on my head would escape. Putting me on the ground. I knew he always did this, but every time I was afraid. That it would really bring me down. Emma Bonino, Emma Bonino. Also to mine. But honey, what are you doing? I'm leaving. But. But it's four o'clock. - Will you rest a few more hours? - But no way. You are a liar. You've got me fooled. Poor man. The lonely, abandoned sick person. Wifeless. - Instead, as it happens. - See what. Earlier that other asshole Luca rang my phone. Who calls me at this hour. I went to answer. And what do I find? Professor Giannelli's photos with a beautiful maiden. About my age. Depraved. - What are you talking about? - Stop lying, huh? Fucking depraved! To get laid with me there was a need to invent you all this crap. At this point I don't even believe your sickness anymore as long as you slip it in. In some hole you would be willing to make up anything. But will you calm down? These are photos of me and my daughter. She died. Sadly, she died less than a year ago in a car accident. You keep making fun of me. Dean. Some teachers know this. I, however, did not want to divulge the news. Because death is a private matter. Are you making this up as well? Look there's no need anymore, you've fucked me by now. Yes, in fact that is correct, it would no longer be needed. So come on! Roberta, come here. Eh. Eh. Eh. Eh. Eh. Eh. Your mother! Roberta Eh. Eh. Eh. Eh. Eh. Eh. Yes, mother. Yes, you're right, we've been chatting, we didn't realize the time. Yes, Mom, in 15 minutes I'll be there. Hello. Come here, Tullio. What other secrets do you have? Don't you think it's time to vent to someone. As in last rites? I confess and get rid of all my sins. Is that how Roberta feels about it? I don't. But I have already told you. I am already dead. I am not afraid of what lies ahead. In fact, it is a liberation. After all. What is the difference? Three death, the dream. Only the duration. All here. I would like to think like you. But this is not the case. For me death is nothingness. the Eternal that shocks me like infinity. These are terms I cannot understand. That they put me in crisis. I July always in crisis, it's that others can't understand it. Earlier I lashed out with nastiness. When I was little I used to spite everyone. Then as a teenager I used the weapon of seduction. And when I came of age I took the piss out of men and women, all with the same weapon pure sex. Do you understand what I mean? Pure. Without physical, emotional ties, without creating ethical and moral problems for me. I used my pussy to subdue everyone. You did well. July. You resisted. I liked you. You would have been a great dad for me. But I wouldn't have liked to be your father. Little matter. In fact, maybe it's better that way. Everything around me exudes desire. I will continue in this way. Julius I can feel it. I won't forget you, though, what you may still be hiding. But I no longer hide anything from Roberta. You have met the real Julius tonight. How many times we think we are naked when we are not. You know. It is late. Julius I have to go. I don't know if you know this, but I'm going to have an exam in a few hours. With Professor Giannelli and they say he is a big asshole. MM I've heard that, too, and I've also heard. who has a soft spot for the Nazarenes art movement. Ah, the Nazarenes. Thank you Julius. Good thing I was a teetotaler. Thank you for the night. Thank you for everything. You were amazing! Hi Antonella, I have it in my fist. Professor Giannelli put it in his ass that piece of shit. That's right. And tomorrow get ready to celebrate the passing of the exam. Sorry if I woke you up, but I couldn't wait to tell you. But. - Hi Dad. - Hi Amanda, did you have a good time? Then mom tells you about it. - Uh oh. - Hello! How are you doing? Well, it will be a beautiful time. Well, but I can see you didn't bring it that good. You brought a lot of rain. It has been raining here for two days. I'm glad to be home. I have missed you so much. Masaccio and Masolino da Panicale were two great painters. Of the early Tuscan 400s. In which religious complex did they both work? And which one influenced the other, despite being younger. Younger than Masaccio, more innovative than the style largely still Gothic, by Masolino. Both worked in the Brancacci Chapel in Florence. Well, then let's stay in the same time and place frame. Can you tell me what the large fresco represents. Of the Medici Riccardi Palace in Florence? This magnificent fresco depicts the famous procession of the Magi, That is, the arrival in great pomp of the Morean despot John 8.?, With his entire retinue at the Council of Ferrara in 1438. For the attempt of the Union of the two Catholic and Orthodox Churches, For the attempt precisely to unite both churches after the Eastern Schism occurred four centuries earlier. Good. It was painted by Benozzo Gozzoli twenty centuries earlier and almost 20 years later, 20 years after the event, based on drawings. And Pisanello medals. All right, I see you are prepared. I would have given her 30 if she hadn't had that slip. Can I give you 28 Satisfied? - Thank you, professor. - You are welcome. Good morning Ms. Adriano, I can no longer find the one. We prepared tonight. All right Adriano, you keep looking. It has to be there somewhere. Meanwhile, I begin. Ah, Miss Gastaldi, we meet again. - Has she prepared this time? - Yes, I studied. So tell me about the origins of Dadaism. I'm actually not very prepared. On Dadaism, I have delved a lot. Adriano, we must be standing somewhere. Until dawn for nothing. Miss? Well... Then I delved a lot into other topics, for example. the Nazarene movement. Yes, but that is a movement, though. Good thing. That is a movement I know all too well. I, however, would like to hear something about the origin of Dadaism. You have to understand it, it's the 4th time. Who fails the exam. - It would be enough to study more. - And it would only take more study. But these young people, between discos, alcohol and other things? They also claim to pass the exams. Whatever, the important thing is that we found the notes. Look, I'll stretch my legs, have a coffee. You continue. Paccagnella Roberto. Good morning.
