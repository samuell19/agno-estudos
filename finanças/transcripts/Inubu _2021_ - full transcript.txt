That's all for today. If anyone has any questions, please come up to me. The report on spinal column injuries is due tomorrow, so don't forget that. Dismiss. Hanai, we're going to have a report prep session. Wanna come? Oh, sorry, I can't. I've got a kid waiting. - What? - Nice. - They're still babies. You're a father? Well, yeah. - Keep it up. - Keep it up. H-Hey... Excuse, excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me... Sota! - Did she gave birth? - She did. - Can I come and take a look later? - Sure. Yes! I'm home, Hanako. Yes, I'm home. Yeah, yeah. Where's Ayumi? Ayumi. Ayumi? How'd it go? You're all doing well. Good. I'm coming in. Shh. Ah, wait, wait... So cute.... They are trying their best to live. Yes. Rumi, too. Rumi. She's doing great. So cute. Ah! Yoshimi, can I ask you a favor? What is it? Can you go to Shibasaki's and borrow some materials? What? Now? I need it to write a report for tomorrow. Why don't you just go yourself? Right? Because of them... Leave them to me. I had 10 cats at home. Right. Sorry. No, no. It's really great seeing puppies and kittens. Now, please go. - I'm counting on you! - Yeah! What's wrong? You want this? Here. I've got some more. Here, here... Here. Good, good, good... What are you doing here? What's wrong? It's okay. It's okay. Hey, hey. - So... you brought her home? - Yeah. Is that okay? Her life or surgical reports are more important. No, it's... Hey, you... I'm almost done. Okay, okay. Wait. There we go. There we go. Sota, you are by far the biggest dog freak I've ever met in my life. What, dog freak? I am respectfully referring to people who live for their dogs, as "dog freaks". Oh, and by the way, I'm a "cat freak." You're a cat freak? I'm a dog freak? Probably the other freak. - Sota, I brought the materials! - Oh, thank you! - Huh? - That's great. What's wrong with that dog? See? A freak, right? That's so true. Huh? "freak"? She's got no expression. - Yeah. - There's scars all over her body. Where'd you come from? I'll have to call the animal shelter and the police. If it's a stray dog, we'll find her a new owner soon, don't worry. - Have you decided on a name yet? - Name? Let's see... Niko. Because you don't even smile. I see. It's Niko. I hope one day you can smile. Yes. You'll be alright. Want some? - The hell is this... - It's chips. They gave me a sample. This is a dog food. The spring rush of delivery left me with no money. - It's not so bad, you know. - I don't want it. I found Niko's owner! "Surgery Laboratory." Tsk. So Niko is Amuro's dog - That means Niko is... - A dog for surgical practice. Maybe she was intended to be euthanized at the animal shelter... By practice, you mean they use live dogs, right? Yes, they cut open the belly of an innocent dog and take its life. - You'll understand in four years. - Sota! Careful of what you say. I know. It has contributed to the advancement of veterinary medicine. I know. But I'm not giving Niko back. We can't cause any more trouble for Professor Amuro. What if you can't be a vet? Can I help you? This. You found her? I'm Akita, fourth year veterinary student, and I'm helping Professor Amuro. - Where's Professor Amuro? - He's not here. No, but thank you for saving her. It was my fault she escaped. She escaped? I'll pick her up later. Thank you. Your address is... Ah... Thank you earlier. Come in. Keep your shoes on. Oh, so these are the dogs you guys say you're personally protecting. Yes. - Oh, Hanai, it's been a while. - Hello. I never thought I'd find her here with you. It's like the dog knows what it's doing. She thought, "Oh, this person can help me." But it doesn't work like that. - This dog is... - I know, sir. Sota. Niko. You gotta go. Akita, help him. Yes. Excuse me, Mr. Hanai. Okay, come here. Hey, it's gonna be okay, okay? Come on... Come on. Good. Hanai, thank you for protecting her. Please excuse us. Niko... I'm sorry. Sota, what is it? Don't ask any questions. Just come to the apartment. Huh? What... No... - No one followed you here, right? - What? Never mind. Just get in here. Niko! Hello... Sota! Wait... you didn't steal her... No! I was on my way home after class, and Niko was there. She ran away again. She wanted to see me. So what are you gonna do? This time it's not looking good. What are you going to do? They're here. Is our dog in your care again? No. Sota. Don't. We have your dog. Oh, I see. May I? Excuse me. Sota. Niko. - Niko. - Niko. Let's go, Niko. - It's okay, it's okay. - Niko. Niko. Niko. Niko. Niko. Sota. Niko, good girl... Then I'll take her. No, wait, Akita. I'm giving this dog to Hanai. She's struggled to escape this far. I can't take away that vitality. We're studying veterinary medicine to save animals' lives. Life is good, isn't it? Well then, take care of her. This is a special case. Yes, thank you very much. You might just change the world of veterinarians. Bye. Akita, you're done for today. Ah, yes. Niko, you are saved! This is great, Sota. Excuse me, the collar... - No, not good at all! - What? Niko was saved, but it was a special case. I don't want one animal to die on my watch. Then what are you gonna do? I need help. I could save more if I had help. - Which is why I'm thinking of starting a club. - A club? How are you going to get people to come? They're already here. The name will be Dog Club! Let's make a dog club. "Dog Club", so you're not saving cats? We help everyone who's alive. Be it dogs or cats. Then I'd like to be in charge of cats in the Dog Club. - Okay, you're in. - Yay! Can I join you? These lab dogs, I wondered if I could do something for them. Sure. But you can't let the dogs escaped anymore. Start by taking the lab dogs for a walk. Yes, definitely! Good. Dog Club, huh? Nice, isn't it? Dog Club. Hanako! Hanako. Alright, Hanako is in the club too! Shut up! Hang in there! Ah! Hey! Hey... And so, the Dog Club was born, led by Sota Hanai, a fifth-year student at Towada Veterinary Medical School. [ Dog Club ] Our main mission is to rescue dogs and cats that have nowhere else to go and find new owners for them. Niko who was saved from surgery practice has found a new owner. Niko's survival gave me an insight into what the mission is all about. I was struggling with my university classes, and I barely had enough time and energy, but seeing the smiling faces of the cats and dogs gave me a sense of fulfillment that all my exhaustion vanished. All right, I'm taking it... - Hanako, Hanako... camera. - And the pose is... - Pose? - Let's do a pose. - What pose? - Bark! Bark! - Bark! Bark! - Look over there! We, the Dog Club, continued our efforts to create a world where all animals can live happily. [ Dog Club! ] [ English subtitle brought to you by ECOTV ] [ Late Spring, 2019 ] [ Hanai Animal Hospital ] We'd like to know about their medical history, if you know anything about it, and we'd like you to talk to the doctor about that, too. He got bit by another dog... A fight? The other guy look like a stray. It's pretty bad. He's gonna need a surgery. - Hospital? - That would be better. Uh, well, um... Don't worry about the money. - I'm so sorry. - It's okay. Okay, I'm going to trim the hair. Just hold it him in place. Okay. Doctor Sota, the stray cats are here. I've heard that you spay and neuter stray cats. I do. Thank goodness. A stray cat gave birth to kittens near my house, and it caused a lot of trouble. It's okay. How many of them did you bring? About ten of them. I went to the local hospitals, but they all refused me. - Right. It took me about two hours to drive here. Must have been hard. - We'll take care of them once we're done. - Thank you. - Let me help you. - Sorry. Thank you. - This way. - Yes. - Okay. - Let's begin. Okay. - It's a little too much white, isn't it? - Yeah. Ushi? Ushi-chan. Doctor, you must be hungry. I don't think so. - Can I get you something? - No, I'm good. - She's the last one. - That was quicker than I thought. Call that volunteer from earlier. Did you take on these cats for free again by any chance? Yes, I did. I can't say no to someone who drove two hours by herself to get here. I know that, of course. Most that are killed at the Animal Shelter Center are kittens. That's why it's so important to spay and neuter strays so that they won't multiply anymore. I know there are volunteers who do this for free. So? You take on too much work by yourself, Doctor. - Somebody's got to do it. - Even if you say it. What will you do if you collapse? I wasn't complimenting you. Hanako. I'm getting pissed off. Papa... Please train the juniors. And take a break and have a proper meal. I do. That's my food. I'm sorry. No way. An emergency? It's okay. Let's take it. You stay right there, Doctor. Stay. Hanako. Hanako. What can I do for you? Excuse me... Is Mr. Sota Hanai here? He's here.. - Is this an emergency? - Ah, no... Come in. Thank you very much. Doctor. In here. [ Pet Shop Dream ] Mr. Kume! Hey. - Hello. - Hello. - This is the veterinarian, Doctor Hanai. - Nice to meet you. Hello. - Thank you. - Please take care. Let's go, Natsu. My Fran√ßois scratches his ears a lot. - He's itching. - I see. Okay, let me see your ears. It's Malassezia. Malassezia. It's gonna be okay. Okay. Excuse me. Okay... Director, Ms. Komori brought us something. That lady always brings us good food. Yes. Director, a kid here says he found kittens. - No, no. He needs to leave. - B-But... I'm sorry. There's nothing we can do here. Maybe you could talk to your mother or father again. I can't keep them at home. No, they said. Kid, maybe you should take them to the Animal Shelter Center. If I take them to the center, they'll just kill them. No, these days, they don't all get put down. I'm sorry. It's okay. I'll find its owner. Thank you very much. Are you okay? I'm sorry. Dad! I mean... Director. How about we keep them and find their owners? No, we can't. I've told you before, don't get involved in animal protection. But... And now for the news. Yesterday evening in Towada City, Aomori Prefecture, veterinarian Sota Hanai, 38, from Tokyo, was arrested on suspicion of home invasion, damage to property, and theft. According to the Towada Central Police, Hanai is suspected of sneaking into this pet store, Dream, and stealing 30 popular dog breeds worth approximately 2 million yen. No, it was a terrible experience. It's like he forced his way in. The suspect Hanai, works as a veterinarian and is also involved in animal protection activities... Ms. Yoshimi. Ah... Tahara, what is it? It seems that a graduate from our university was arrested. Oh, really? They said he's the one who created the Dog Club. - As I recall, you used to be in the dog cl-- - What!? Did you just say "Dog Club"? Yes. Hanai, you're free to go. - Doctor Sota! - I'm sorry for troubling you, Satoko. - What the hell are you doing? - I'm sorry. Anyway, how are those dogs? A shelter over here is taking care of them, right? I'm not allowed to give that information to a suspect. No, Mr. Tanahashi. They're all in need of treatment. Have you been to the store? Some are dead, the sanitation is terrible, and there isn't enough food. As far as the police are concerned, there's no problem. That's crazy, isn't it? The Act on Welfare and Management of Animals states that if you don't keep them in a proper environment, it's abuse... Hanai, I understand how you feel but... you were arrested for theft. - I don't care about that. The dogs are... Doctor Sota, let's go home. If you make a scene, you'll end up back in jail. Mr. Tanahashi, please do something. I'm sorry. It's not my jurisdiction. - Sota! - What the hell's going on? There's no money, no food, there's nothing I can do. I'll take them all. You're taking it for free? The center won't even take them in nowadays. There's a company that'll take them. It's too expensive. This. This. I can't afford this shit. [ Pets you can no longer keep, we'll take them! ] You don't run the store anymore, do you? Back in the day, when puppies were born, they would sell like hotcakes. I guess their boom is over. They say cats are more profitable now. I'll have them all spayed and neutered so they won't give birth anymore, if that's fine. - Sure, if you'll take them. - Okay. Then it's not your fault at all, Mr. Sota. Did you sign any contract? No. It was too sudden. I told you so, didn't I? You take on so much work. What kind of contract is that before life? This is just like back at the Dog Club! - That's right. - What? Back when we were in school, he had a run-in with the police. They said they couldn't take care of them anymore, so Sota asked if they could take them in, and he... took ten, remember? Later, the owner's grandmother came and said, "they've been stolen!" We got a report here. At that time, Shibasaki stepped in between, so we were able to manage. Let's not talk about that. Speaking of Mr. Shibasaki, why isn't he here? I don't know. - You want me to call him? - No! You don't have to. Satoko, can you head back first? What? I have somewhere to go. No. - I can't leave those dogs alone. - No! I have to go. Okay. I'll take care of the hospital while you're gone. Take this instead. Please read it carefully. - "List of things not to do." - That's right. "Don't take on everything on your own. Don't push yourself, no dog chips." The hell is this? If you don't, I'll... quit. - Are you serious? - I am! Then, members of the Dog Club, please take care of Doctor Sota. Okay, let's go. Hello! Oikawa, I've just given him an IV. Look after him. - I'm sorry. - Hey! - I've been waiting for you! - Mrs. Nakagoshi. I'm sorry for the inconvenience. It is. - It's been a while. I'm Akita. - Do you remember me? I'm Yoshimi. Ah! Dog Club! Wow, you guys are all here. No, no, that's not important. We've got a problem. That old man Kume brought the police and took all the dogs away. - What? He owns them, so I can't do anything. Mrs. Nakagoshi, you saw those dogs, right? It's horrible. So why did you give them back? I understand that, but there's nothing I can do if he brought the police here! That's right. He owns them. Why does he have ownership of their lives? That's even weirder. - A dog is a dog! - Sota, please calm down. I can't calm down! Who knows what's gonna happen to the dogs as we speak? I'm so sorry. Um... Mika Kawase, she's been worried sick waiting for you. I was the one who took Mr. Sota to Mr. Kume. No need to apologize. All right, let's all go get those dogs back. Sota, that's a bad idea. We're not students anymore. Why are you talking like a boring adult? No, no. We're all adults here. Our mission as veterinarians is to save lives. Don't be stupid. "Stupid"... Mr. Akita was worried about you, so he came all this way from Tokyo. - I didn't ask him to. - Huh? You don't have to say that. If you're going to fight, why not do it outside? Wait, what happened to Shibasaki? He stayed here, right? - Don't worry about him. - Okay. Well, anyway. If you're going to leave them with me, make sure you take ownership of them first. That's all I'll say. Okay? Oh, right. - You're good with cats, right? - What? Take a look at something, will you? Ah, okay. It's my fault... I'm really sorry. You want to save those dogs, right? Yes. Then it's okay. - I'll take it from here. - No, but... Don't worry. Who do you think you're talking to here? Mr. Kume! Are you there? Mr. Kume! - What the hell? - How are the dogs? - If you want it back, you should have told me. - Shut up. Please don't get rid of them. I'll take care of them, I promise. It's none of your business. I'm not mad at you at all, Mr. Kume! Leave or I'll call the police! Mr. Kume... Mr. Kume! Let's talk one more time! Hey! Mr. Kume! Mr. Kume! Take... Take this! What's wrong? [ Dog Thief Unforgivable! ] [ Give the animals back to nature! ] The hell is that? Don't worry about it. I'll keep it. Anyway, come inside. [ Horrible, unbelievable ] [ Crazy vet hospital ] [ Too scary ] [ The doctor who saved my dog. What a crime... ] Should we... close for the day? Shall we... Hanako... Can't our hospital start some kind of protection activity? We could take in dogs that have nowhere else to go, or stray cats. No need to do that. Protection isn't something a vet should be doing. Wasn't it your senior who was arrested the other day? No, that's... It's dangerous to keep a dog that you don't even know where it came from. Stray cats are also at high risk. What if they're infected? It's going to cause trouble for all the other patients. Not until you have your own hospital. But I wondered if there was a point to it... What? That was a huge statement. You see, I was in charge of cats in the Dog Club. Okay. One day we found a stray cat with a huge belly. I thought, "Oh, she's pregnant." But it was just water in her stomach. That's the last stage of FIP, right? Yes. And... the other cats got FIP too. We ended up letting ten of them die. That must have been hard. That's why I can't let... that happen again to the cats. I've decided that I'm going to take down the FIP. That's so cool. But there's no effective vaccine. There's no cure. I don't even know if it's contagious. Almost 10 years have passed with nothing to show for it. Hanako... What do you think I should do? [ Spring, 2000 ] [ Towada Animal Shelter Animal Control Center ] These are the dogs that came in today. They were captured or brought in by their owners. The next room is room 2. These are the dogs that came in yesterday. This is how we move them from one day to the next. And the last one? If we can't find an owner, then we... put them down. Is it by gas? Yes. How horrible. Yes. I'm sorry, but this is the end of the tour. - I'll take all these dogs. - Huh? If I take care of all of them, you won't have to kill them, right? I'm sorry... We don't give away full-grown dogs. I don't know who you are, so I don't want you to get in trouble. I'm a student at a veterinary college in Towada, so I'm okay with being bitten. That's the rule. Right now, the only dogs we can give away are puppies. - Why only puppies? - It's the rule. I'm sorry. Oh, and what about you? I'd like to adopt a puppy, too. Okay. Right this way, please. Do you two have any preferences? - Any puppy will do. - Any puppy will do. No... No way... Actually, I'm also a student at Towada Veterinary Medical School. So I can deal with any dog. What, the same school? What year? - I'm Ryosuke Shibasaki, a second-year student. - So we're classmates. Then Shibasaki, you can choose first. I'll take care of the rest of the puppies. No, there are other people who want puppies, so you can't take them all. Then give the last dog to me... and the second from the last to Shibasaki. Huh? Oh, that's fine. Okay. This is Hanako, and Shibasaki's dog is Taro. Yeah. Nice to meet you, Hanako. I guess I named them both. You're so cute, Hanako. So... Hanai, why did you choose veterinary medicine? I've loved dogs since I was a kid, and I thought it would be great to be a vet. What about you? I... want to stop the killing. What? You have to be a veterinarian to be the director of the animal shelter, right? My plan is to get into the animal shelter and stop the killing. You're going all that way to where they're putting them out? But I think there's hope. I have a big dream to change the worst place. Shibasaki. You're hell of a lot better than I thought you were. What? Let's be friends starting today. Let's do what we can to help those unfortunate dogs and cats. Yeah. All right, it's settled. Are you getting tired now, Taro? - He's been gaining weight lately... - He's getting fat? He eats a lot. You write... Come on, say hello. That feels good, doesn't it? Okay, here we go. Okay. Okay. Sota, are you serious? Huh? You said you're boycotting surgery practice. That's right. I won't do that. You can't become a vet without surgery practice. Using a live dog as a teaching material is insane, right? Even if it was a dog that was supposed to be killed, I won't do it. Let me tell you again, if you don't do the practical, you won't be able to take the state exam. I know that. You said you wanted to be a vet and save lives. That's the hurdle you have to overcome to get there. No! I won't do it. I'll do it. I'll do it and be a vet. I'll never forget how I got my hands dirty. Have you ever heard of the phrase "one kill to save many lives"? One kill to save many lives? Originally, it was a Buddhist phrase which means that by killing one person, you save many. In surgery practice, it's true that one life is sacrificed. But... through that practice, we learn about life, we become veterinarians, and we can save many lives. Can you think of it like that? For example, how about gaining experience by attending surgeries at a local veterinary clinic? In fact, it's what most Western veterinary colleges do. I don't know if any veterinarian would be willing to help with that. I'll look for them. I'll get as many cases as I can and submit them in a report. Okay. Well, let's look at those reports and see what we can find. Thank you very much. - Report? - Yes. - Good luck with that. - Thanks. Good work. We can't treat diseases, huh? I need to examine an animal. Information and knowledge. Knowledge. I can save them all. Then you may begin. - Yes, sir. - Yes, sir. I'll make the incision. Stop the bleeding, please. It's over. Hanako. Hanako. Hanako, it's over. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. You've been watching me. Thank you. Yes. I respect what you're trying to do, but you shouldn't think you can change the world all by yourself. I believe I can save them all. I'm going to do it alone. Thank you very much. Mr. Kume, it's Hanai! Don't just come in here without permission. I'll call the police. Now, now. I'm sorry. I'm sorry... I just brought the food today. All right, come on. Eat. I'll use your water. Here, have some water. Good. Hey! I'm going home in a minute. - Here's some sweet bean buns for you. - I don't want it. It's really good. I'll... I'll leave it here. Here you go. I brought you some food. Mr. Kume! [ Naoyuki Kume Tetsuko ] Anyone home? Mr. Kume! Mr. Kume! It's Hanai. - What, you again? - I've brought the food. I've got some snacks. Can I leave it here, then? You want some? - Elsa won't like it. - No, it's just a snack. She's an experienced mother. This one here is the first dog. Elsa? I see. You did good. Have a good rest. You're gonna be okay. Hmm? You're gonna be okay. You like it? She was my wife's dog. She loved dogs. So... I want to have this little thing for her... We built the pet store because she said she wanted to do it. So we borrowed money to build the store and we worked hard together. Elsa's retired now. I don't care anymore. The neighbors say the place stinks and it's too noisy, and the girl promised she'd help me. Ms. Kawase? She used to come to my store all the time to look at the dogs. Why did you call the police? I missed the dog when you took them away. So that's why... Because Elsa was my wife's dog. I was afraid my wife would get mad if I gave her to you. If I hadn't done that, you never would've given her back. You should've told me. Okay, good. Doctor, Mr. Hanai's on the phone. Ah.. Thanks. - Hello? Akita speaking. - Oh, Akita. It's the dogs from that pet store in Towada, and if they let me have it, I'll operate on it, but I need your help. What? Where is it? I'm thinking of doing it in Towada. Um... what about the ownership issue? I'll take care of it. I'm sorry. I can't take a day off from our hospital, and on my days off, I'm with my family. Is that so? I understand. [ Mr. Sota ] Over here. Over here. Ah... They're so cute... Come here. I just had to show it to you, Ms. Yoshimi. Wow, you're so cute... Hey, what are we gonna do with them? Don't worry. I've decided to keep them all. All of it? I've got my mother, my grandmother, a dog and a cat, so I can handle a little extra. It's not that simple, you know. What... what do you mean? I'm sorry. I told you before, I've had a lot of cats die on me. That's when I knew I'm not qualified to have a cat anymore. That's why I'm bothered when people simply say they want to "keep" them. Does one need a qualification to own a cat or a dog? Well, I thought... if they have nowhere else to go, then I'll take them. It's that simple. Yeah. Maybe I'm just wrong about a lot of things. There are many ways to deal with animals. There are no "right" answers, remember? Now, let's get on and make that vaccine, shall we? Oh, that? Yeah, right. Yes? Is now a good time? Nana said she had a favor to ask. - Daddy. - What is it? For my next birthday present, I want a shelter cat. A shelter cat? You are a vet. I bet you save a lot of lives. Nana wants to help, too. That's why I want to adopt a shelter cat. John, John, over here. John, house, house. Good for you. See you tomorrow. - All right, we're done here. - Yes. I'll be fine on my own. See you tomorrow, Taro. Mr. Shibasaki, you don't look well. Do you have a cold? - No, I'm fine. - You... - Your nose is dry. - My nose is usually dry. He's not a dog. - Yoshimi, yours is dry too... - No, don't... - You good? - Go home. Go home. - I'll be here in the morning. - Good work. - Good work. - Good work. Bye-bye, Taro. Hanako. It's gonna be cold night, huh? Huh? Shibasaki? Shibasaki. Shibasaki. Taro? Taro. Shibasaki! Hey, Shibasaki! Shibasaki! What are you doing? Shibasaki! Shibasaki! Hey! Shibasaki. You're burning up, Shibasaki! You're Ryosuke Shibasaki. Can you understand me? Yes. He looks pale. But why is he out here? There's kerosene and stuff here, so I guess he came to get it. - It's a miracle. - What? The temperature was below zero and he was out here all night. It's a miracle, that's all I can say. - Hey... - Excuse me. What is it, Mr. Shibasaki? The dogs... they haven't eaten anything since yesterday, so please feed them. What? The dogs, feed them. - Feed? - I got it. Don't worry about it. Shibasaki, if you die, the dogs will die too. I'm sorry, Sota. The dogs. I couldn't protect them... Idiot. The dog protected you. Commence transport. Hurry, hurry... Congratulations! Thanks. Thanks. You both are officially veterinarians. Well, we'll see about that. There they are... Taro. Taro. Taro. - Hanako. - Taro. Taro. Shibasaki! Do you want to run a veterinary clinic with me someday? I'll train for a few years, and then I'll open a hospital that also does animal rescue. We've been over this before. The answer is no. Are you seriously going to work at the center? Yes. - You're gonna have to put them down. - I know that. You don't have to do this. - Come with me-- - Because someone has to do it. so I will do it. With my own hands, I'm gonna stop them. You have your ways of doing things, Sota. We may do things differently, but aren't we aiming for the same thing? I don't think it's the same. I don't want to kill a single one of them. - I don't want to kill either. - If so... I'm sorry, Sota. [ Towada City Animal Control Center ] He quit? Is Ryosuke Shibasaki not here? Yes. Why did he quit? When did he quit? - That's private information, so... - I'm Shibasaki's best friend. - It's no problem at all. - No, it's not that... I also got a dog here named Hanako. - She's doing great. - I see. No, but it's... And this Shibasaki has one named Taro... Excuse me... What a nice environment you got here. It was Mr. Shibasaki's idea to use it like this. Since Mr. Shibasaki came here, this center has changed. We used to be in one of the top ten rates of animal euthanasia, but now it's down to 30%. Come in. This is where we spay and neuter all the dogs and cats in our care. Mr. Shibasaki himself was performing the surgery. Why did Shibasaki quit? Animal euthanasia... has decreased, but we still do put down animals. Old dogs, sick dogs and kittens are still subject for putting down. On the day they are put down, Mr. Shibasaki walked with them, fed them their favorite foods, and then gave each one a shot in their arms to put them to sleep before sending them off. I think maybe he just couldn't take it anymore. I don't think I can manage to kill one. Mr. Hanai, you didn't do surgery practice, did you? Shibasaki told you that? Mr. Shibasaki often talked about you a lot. We don't have to do that ridiculous surgery practice. You're really strong, Mr. Hanai. What? Mr. Shibasaki wasn't as strong as you. Mr. Shibasaki tried to inject himself with a lethal drug. Mr. Shibasaki, w--what are you doing? Wait, st-- Hey, st-- Don't do it! Don't... - I'm gonna go with them. - Hey... I'm gonna go with them. Get a grip on yourself! Please stop! Why... Why... Why do they keep sending dogs and cats here even after we save them? Why? Why do we have to kill those who are still alive? They... They haven't done anything wrong. Humans, we multiply on our own, we take lives, and I've had enough. No... Even so... Wait! Mr. Shibasaki! After that, he quit the center, and now I can't reach him. [ Shibasaki ] Oh, my. Sota. Wow, it's been a while. It's been a while since we last met. Sota, you came all this way... - Thank you. But Ryosuke's away on business right now. Is he all right? Yeah, he's fine. He's a salesman for a pharmaceutical company. He travels here and there. If so, then it's fine. Yes. This cat is one that I took in. I see. Hey. Then, um... when Ryosuke comes home, please give him this. It's my contact info. I run a small veterinary hospital in Tokyo. Okay. I'll give this to him. Let's do our best today... - Hello. - Ah, Sota, you're here. Mrs. Nakagoshi. Thanks. - Get everything ready. - Yes. Mr. Kume, I'm glad you've made a decision. - They're doing it for free, right? - Of course. Then it's okay. Sota, I'm counting on you today. Yes. I'm sorry about all this. What are you talking about? We'll just have to do what we always do. Right. Here they come. What you have is your friend. Why are you here? Mr. Sota, if I leave you to it alone, Satoko will get mad at me. We're vets, too. What about your family? It's okay. - Did you get divorced? - No, I didn't! - What the hell are you saying? - It's over there. Hello. Ah, let's do it! Good girl. Thank you very much for your hard work. - Good work. - Good work today. - It was exhausting, wasn't it? - Well done! Yeah. Thanks for the help. If you hadn't been here, I would've been up till morning. That's right. Good work. So... what are we going to do with those dogs? - I'm thinking of holding an adoption fair. - What? That's what Mr. Kume says he wants. Hey, Sota, are you sure that's okay? - You're gonna get tricked-- - I don't care if I got tricked. I want to save them. So, will you please help me one more time? Let's hold an adoption fair like we used to, and find new owners for them. I guess we don't really have a choice. Well, if that's the case, then eat some corn first, you idiots. - Let's dig in! - Let's dig in! Good. Doctor Sota, good morning. Good morning. - What did you do this time? - What? A lot of things came in here. - Oh, apple juice. - It's some kind of sauce. - Oh, it's Gen Tare. - What? Is it popular? - Yeah, it's from Aomori... - What about this one? Garlic, tomatoes, cucumbers... Oh, wait. A letter... Aomori... Who is it from? Oh, look, "Dear Doctor Sota..." "I found out about the pet store, Dream, on Instagram." "For the dogs of Towada, thank you very much..." - Instagram? - Instagram? Let's take a look. Ms. Kawase was the one who posted about it. There's also one from that junior member of the Dog Club. Oh... Pakuchi. How nostalgic. We're from Dog Club. We're holding an adoption fair. Please check it out. - How about it? - The Dog Club is holding an adoption fair! We're doing an adoption fair! - Hello! - Hello. - Hello. - Hello. Um... my daughter wants a dog. What kind of dog do you want? Any dog will do. Any dog will do. That's rude. I'm sorry. Me and this one here, when we went to get our dog, we said, "Any dog will do." And then... I met Taro here. And... this is my dog, Hanako. Now she's my best friend. Wanna touch her? So cute. You want to see the other dogs? Yes. - Shibasaki, please. - Yeah. Okay, let's go. There's a lot of them, huh? Actually, my daughter doesn't go to school. I thought if she got a dog, they might become friends. If that's the case, I'm sure he'll find the right dog for her. Which one of these dogs is the least popular? Huh? Why do you ask? Come on, just tell me. Puppies are really popular. They're cute, right? But old dogs can be... really, really cute. He's a regular at adoption fairs, and it's hard for him to find a mate. It's a male. What's his name? His name is Rokuro. I'll take Rokuro. I see. But why? Because he's like me. Like you? I don't have any friends, and no one likes me at all. Same as Rokuro. No? Not at all. I'm sure Rokuro will be your best friend. Isn't that right, Rokuro? - You're not scared? - Yes. You were Rokuro's owner, weren't you? I'm sorry I didn't tell you. So... how's Rokuro? Six years ago... I was 15. I see. He did good. Rokuro was really smart. He learned to sit up and shake. And then I wanted to show him to everyone. Next thing I knew, I was going to school. And then after that we were together all the time. But... Huh? Once I got into high school, I enjoyed club activities and hanging out with my friends. - Mika, your lunch! - Oh, no. - Don't forget it. - Thanks. - You be careful. - Yes... I... in Rokuro's final moments, I was not there with him. While I was at summer camp, he... Rokuro. Rokuro! I'm so sorry... I'm so sorry. I didn't even... get to say goodbye to Rokuro. I wanted to get a dog again, but... I felt bad for Rokuro. I think Rokuro understood that. If I ever get a dog again, it'll be from the Dog Club... I wanted to get a dog from you and Mr. Shibasaki. That's when Mr. Kume from Dream asked me for advice. So it was like that. I didn't mean to drag you into this. I'm sorry. - No, you didn't. Thank you for telling me. Mr. Shibasaki, how is he? I'm here again. Sota, I'm sorry. I think Ryosuke caught a cold. Hanako! Long time no see. Wow, good girl. - Good girl, good girl. - She remembers you. - Is he in his room? - Yes, he is, but... - Can I talk to him for a sec? - No. - You might catch it... No, no - No, that's okay. - I just want to see him. - Wait... No... Shibasaki! It's me! Shibasaki! Shibasaki! [ Let's do the Dog Club again! ] Shibasaki! Hanako. Hanako. How are you, Hanako? Where's Taro? He passed away three years ago. I see. Shibasaki. Take a look at this. Rokuro? - This girl is... Mi... Mika, right? - Yeah. Now she's a college student in Tokyo. Well, I got arrested. - I saw it on TV. - It was crazy. I'm not talking about that. I've been getting a lot of stuff. Look. They're all smiling, right? Dogs, cats, and people. And there's letters too. This is what we do. That's what the Dog Club has done. They're so adorable. Right? What's this? - "List of things not to do." - Give me that. "Don't take on everything on your own. Don't push yourself." "No dog chips." No, you're still eating dog chips-- No, I don't. Sometimes. Sometimes I eat them. It's not that... You know, I've been thinking about things, too. That's why both Taro... and I... were so happy to have met you. Sota. What the hell are you saying? No, this is not the time to be laughing. Yeah. - Over here. Over here... - Yes. Oh, we work in the same lab. Tahara Yusaku. - I'm Tahara. Nice to meet you. - I'm Hanai. Nice to meet you. - This is Mr. Sota. - Mr. Sota. What is it? What? He's so young. Nice. I'll be damned. Okay, good... Well, yesterday's news said today would be around 38 degrees. - What!? - It will be. - Is it really that bad? - Yes. I wonder if we'll get any customers. Mr. Sota. Mr. Shibasaki. Huh? Mr. Shibasaki! - How many in total? - Thirty today, I think. There are many more in the back, so please take a look. - Thank you. - Yes. Yeah, hold the hip. Like that. Like that. Aren't they cute? That's Keema. Keema. This one had multiple deliveries. That's a lot... I hope she can relax now. I'm sure we'll find her a good owner. They're more interested in seeing Elsa. Go ahead. Wow... As I thought, she's cute. - Can we touch her? - It's a little hard to touch her right now. She's been through a lot and is scared of people. Oh, I see. Even though she looks so cute. She appears to be quite an old lady. But if you're patient with her, I'm sure you'll get along. We strongly believe that. I'm sorry. We've never owned a dog before. I think that's a bit much. Yeah... Maybe a younger one. - We understand. We won't force you. - I'm sorry. If you'd like, you can take a look over here, too. Ah, they're so cute. There's no way Elsa's gonna find someone to take her. Mr. Kume. So why are you doing this? You don't even get paid. Mr. Kume, Sota and the others aren't like that. Mr. Kume. We're veterinarians... we live for the animals. It's normal for us animal professionals to do this kind of thing. The local veterinarian should've helped Mr. Kume's store before it went under. I think the government should be held responsible. I used to work at an animal shelter center in Towada until two years ago, and we're the ones who should be dealing with this. I'm so sorry. We... became veterinarians to save animals' lives. And we won't give up on Elsa. We'll make her happy. They are all good dogs! It's all right. I'm sorry everyone. Take care of Elsa for me. We will. Ms. Okada, I'm sorry. Thank you. I'll take that. - Gather around, everyone! - Yes. - Thank you for your hard work today. - Good work. Thanks to all of you, we've found 14 new adopters. What about the rest? I'll take care of it. Don't worry about it. Excuse me! I'd like to adopt one. Really? That's great. Okay. Which one? Elsa. Elsa, huh? - It's a lot of work. - I know. But... I would like to be an owner. I understand how you feel, but you don't have to push yourself. Is there anyone you can take care of her with? Yes. I live with my cousin in Tokyo, and it's a pet-friendly apartment. Why do you want Elsa? I... couldn't look after Rokuro. So it was like that. That's why I want to face them this time. I want to give her time to relax and be happy. All right, let's try it out. But before that, I want to hang with her for a while. Thank you very much. When I get back to Tokyo, I'll take Elsa to the hospital and will try to get her to open up a little. It's okay. She's a dog who trusted someone once. Take it slow. Yes. Thank you. I'm glad I came. Thank you. - Okay, I'm gonna go. - Oh. Shibasaki. What? What are you going to do now? I'm thinking of going back to the center. I see. What? You're not gonna stop me? If I stop you, will you stop? I won't stop. Right? We may do things differently, but our goals are the same. That's right. I'm gonna try again. Yeah. But first, I'll make a world where not a single dog goes to the center. Well, you'll see. Okay. - See you around. - Oh. See you around. - Ah, this is pyoderma. - Pyoderma... Let's give him some medicine. It happens a lot when it's humid. Is that so? - Do you have an insurance card? - Yes. Okay. Thank you very much. You'll be paying 30%. Okay. Take care. Ah...You made a mess in your toilet again. Elsa. Elsa, let's hang in there. Oh, here it is. Here it is. She's full of energy. - Here, here. - Over here. Oh! Wait, wait... What do I do? What do I do? Help me... what? Wait, wait... - I got him. - You got him? Thank goodness. Thank goodness... Let's get him in. Thank goodness. Grandpa will check on Nana's cat. Yes. Ms. Yoshimi! Over here. Over here. Good work today. Ah, it's kind of tiring, this place. - Ta-da! - AH! What? What? She's a brown tabby cat, Kiji-chan. I thought she might be perfect for you, Ms. Yoshimi. What!? - Are you sure? - My gift to you. Ah! Kiji-chan. - Kiji-chan, you're coming with me. - Be happy, okay? Kiji-chan. Ms. Mika, Elsa's cute, isn't she? She's so cute. - Do you want to hold her? - Yes. - Okay, Elsa. - I hope it's okay. It's okay. It's okay. Yeah, yeah... Looks cool. - It suits him. - It does. - Good, right? - Yup, it's good. Good. You take care now, Cameron. Thank you very much. If you have any questions, feel free to contact us. - Thank you very much. - Yes. Red light, green light, stop! Run! Good for you. You want some? - Oh, walk? - She walked. The act of paying out dogs from shelters for veterinary education has been prohibited since 2005. Also, the "surgery practice" that uses living animals featured in the film was discontinued in 2018 at the university where it was modeled. The shooting was done safely under the guidance of an animal trainer and veterinarian. No harm was done to the animals, and we tried to make them as comfortable as possible. ‚ô™ It's nice to meet you, those eyes, ‚ô™ they sink into the depths of my heart ‚ô™ Even loneliness and melancholy ‚ô™ are wrapped in kindness ‚ô™ Under the cold winter night, ‚ô™ you saved me from freezing with just your body ‚ô™ Even if I'm unreliable or clumsy, ‚ô™ I swear to protect you with these hands ‚ô™ I wanna know you ‚ô™ but I don't think I can stay here for long ‚ô™ In the face of inevitable reality, ‚ô™ there are some things you just can't shake ‚ô™ I wanna hold you, ‚ô™ even if the winds are strong, I won't change, ‚ô™ I'll protect this love ‚ô™ with all my might ‚ô™ I'll never let go of your hand again ‚ô™ so that no more tears will fall ‚ô™ I know what's right and I know the answer, ‚ô™ but I want to believe that miracles do happen ‚ô™ An unforgiving future cruelly announced, ‚ô™ the unnoticed cry of life ‚ô™ My whole body is screaming to reach out to you, ‚ô™ and so with my bare resolve in my heart, ‚ô™ I'll face it ‚ô™ We were so absorbed in each other's company, ‚ô™ we poured out everything we had in our youth ‚ô™ Let's get together under a single thought ‚ô™ and create the revolution of a lifetime ‚ô™ I wanna live with you ‚ô™ No matter how much it hurts, you're not gonna give up, are you? ‚ô™ You can't lie to yourself, can you? ‚ô™ I wanna laugh with you Even if we part ways, it will be all right ‚ô™ Because we both are aiming for the same thing ‚ô™ I'm not going to run away from this absurd world ‚ô™ Looking away is much harder ‚ô™ Believing that hope can be lit in the midst of despair ‚ô™ Even if there's no end in sight, we'll keep fighting together ‚ô™ At times, I was pointed at and ridiculed ‚ô™ There were days when I sighed with sadness ‚ô™ But still, my love overflows and fills up, ‚ô™ so I struggle with all my heart, so that I can be there for you ‚ô™ I'll never let go of your hand again ‚ô™ so that no more tears will fall ‚ô™ I know what's right and I know the answer, ‚ô™ but I want to believe that miracles do happen ‚ô™ An unforgiving future cruelly announced, ‚ô™ the unnoticed cry of life ‚ô™ My whole body is screaming to reach out to you, ‚ô™ and so with my bare resolve in my heart, ‚ô™ we'll live together [ Inubu! ] [ English subtitle brought to you by ECOTV ] [ QC: rjgman56 ]
