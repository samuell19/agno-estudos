(dramatic, Eastern-influenced music) (birds chirping) (frogs croaking) (water rustling) (dramatic music) - Sensei. - Sensei Yamazaki. (barks) - These are the symbols of our rule. The precious golden nunchucks, passed in a tradition from one master to the next in an unbroken chain for 300 years. I'm an old man now, and you Adleman, my American friend and Chiba are my best students. It is time pass to the next generation. Show me what you have learned. - [Adleman] Yes, Sensei. (Chiba barks) (music intensifies) (heavy drum music) (fighters yelling) (Chiba yells) (fighters grunting and yelling) (Chiba groaning) (Chiba yelling) (staff smacking) (Chiba yelling) (kick smacking) (Chiba yelling) (music calms) (fighters yelling) (kick thudding) (Chiba grunts) - Okay Pops, hand 'em over. - No. - I won. - But winning is not everything. Chiba has learned compassion. And that is the sign of a master. - If you think this is over, you're crazy. I'm tired of this grasshopper shit anyway. (menacing music) (gentle music) (men panting) (fighters grunting) (triumphant music) (fighters grunting) (dramatic music) (car tires screeching) (car engine revving) - Master Josh. - The one and only. The old man in? - Yes sir, Mr. Keegan's expecting you sir. (water splashing) - [Josh] You're working too hard, Dad. - [Mr. Keegan] Wish I could say the same thing about you, son. Glad you decided to come by. - Well, actually I'm a little short this month. - What? Another loan? What's it for this time? - It's education, sir. See there's this summer course in the French Alps on 18th Century poetry and I think- - How much? - $5,000. - No, not 5,000, not 500, not $5. - Come on dad, be reasonable, huh? Okay, so I had a couple of setbacks in Vegas. Come on, you're a businessman. Are you going to hold that against me? - Look, up 'til now, you've had it too easy. Cars, women, money. - Yeah? - No more. I'm not going to keep throwing good money after bad until you can prove you're a good investment. - No problem, what do you want me to do? - I want you to enroll in the state's top martial arts academy. You live through it, your allowance will be reinstated. - Is this retroactive? - Look, don't push your luck. When I was young, we had Vietnam. We fought for our country, we died for it. We didn't have any of this "me generation" stuff. - There's always El Salvador. - Look, don't give me any of your lip. You make it through this equivalent of a bootcamp, you'll be okay. 'Til then, zip. - Zip? - Read my lips. Zip. (bouncy upbeat music) - Can we slow down now please? - One more mile. Oh my God, there he is. - The Tai Chi guy? - Yeah, I'm going to swoop in for a closer look. - Oh, Suzy. Well, when you going out? - He hasn't asked me out yet, but he will. Look at this, look at this. - Martial Arts School. - Yeah. - No way, not me, not this time. (playful music) (car horn honks) - This your best day yet? - (scoffs) You never learn. - This is getting to be a drag you know. It's too easy man, people are going to talk. Now why don't you get yourself into shape. And next time we come around, I want you to punch me in the nose or else we're going to die of boredom. (truck honks) (man muttering) (playful music) (man sneezes) (man blowing and coughing) (items clattering) - Ow! (pots clattering) (eggs splattering) Ah! (panting) (hand sizzling) (water steaming) (man panting and muttering) (timer buzzing) Oh! (fire crackling) Ow! I hope she likes extra, extra crispy. No! (dishes clattering) (doorbell rings) (doorbell rings) She's here. Ah ha, uh, Cynthia, hi. - I'd love to stay, but I just remembered. I have to see my dentist about a root canal - Root canal? - Bye! - That's the third one this week. Ah. - Hey Claude. You lose her too? Man, that's too much. That's the third one in two weeks. - Fourth, the last time you were at the movies. Five if count the one that dropped me the day your wife got sick. Oh gee, I don't see what's wrong. - You've got to work on your coordination. Check this out. Picked this up at the supermarket around the corner. - Ninja Academy? - Good stuff, man. If those guys can't teach you to walk and chew gum at the same time, no one will. (spy music) - Mmm, Phillip, is that a gun in your pocket, or are you just happy to see me? - I hate to disappoint you my dear, but that is a gun. - I say my good man, have you noticed any suspicious characters lurking around here lately? - No, no, no, no. What would they look like? - Well they'd be in black, nothing this elegant. They'd be carrying weapons, explosives, toxic chemicals. - Toxic chemicals? Sounds like a bunch that just flew in here. They went that way. (eerie music) - [Henchman] Excuse me, Number One. - What is it? - I'm sorry sir, but your cat has gone. (spy music) (cat mewing) (gunshot fires) (cat screeches) - Terribly sorry. - [Number One] Surprise, surprise Mr. Wellington. - Your PA system is lousy. Hang up and call again. (motorcycle revving) (gunshots blast) (gunshots blasting) Japanese products aren't what they used to be. - [Number One] Damn you Wellington, you killed every one of my men. - I also killed your cat. (Number One laughing maniacally) - [Number One] We'll meet again. (spy music) - Terribly sorry for the interruption sir, but I've got M and M on the satellite channel. - [M And M] I'm very disappointed in you, Double O Seven Eleven. I've been fielding a considerable number of complaints here from various organizations for the prevention of cruelty to animals, not to mention the Japanese ambassador. The feeling here is you've gotten a little carried away. - But sir... - [M And M] License revoked, Double O Seven Eleven. No more wanton killings. - What? - [M And M] Hand the driver your weapon. You're to enroll in a refresher course in the martial arts. You get yourself out of this phallic dependency on your gun in a crisis, and we'll talk again. (birds chirping) (vehicle zooming past) - You wouldn't happen to have a car on you, would you? - Real men don't drive, they walk. (cheerful music) - Jesus, what is this Sherwood Forest? And rabbits. $9.50. That's (laughing) money, I need $9.50, $9.50. - This place looks like a dump. - What are, you deranged? This is what I call heaven. (car backfires) - [Driver] Later babe, maybe we'll catch you back at the beach, huh? - I shall miss the old Beretta. - Of course, sir. - Welcome to our winter session. My name is Gayle Nakiyama. I'm the sensei's assistant and I'll be your instructor. So if you'll follow me, please. (dramatic music) (music intensifies) (Chiba speaking Japanese) Chiba sensei welcomes you all here. (Chiba grunts and speaks Japanese) Training starts first thing in the morning. It's going to be a long week. He recommends you get a good night's sleep. But first I'd like for you to meet our sensei. - Phil baby, you and I will make a killing here. - A killing? - Skirts, the broadsky's. Only the sayonara? She's mine. - I see. (dramatic music) - How do you do? - What's up? So how you been, good? Good. (student speaking stilted Japanese) - Or something like that. - Private George Randall at your service, sir. (bubblegum pops) - How you doing sensei, I'm Claude, give me five. (hand slaps) - Hey listen, you want to drum up more business, you're going to have to lose old Ho Chi Minh here. Serious attitude problem. - [Woman] I'm worried about it. (students muttering) - Everyone outside. - Touchy, touchy. (upbeat music) - All right, choose your beds, settle in and I'll see you later. (music intensifies) - Fantastic. - Well, it isn't Club Med. - Looks like we're going to get to know each other real well, real soon. - I just wonder when we're going to get those little outfits. You know, the cute little black bathrobes. - When you earn them. - Okay, okay. (door squeaks) - I had Herod ship this ahead. Private stock. Caviar anyone? (goofy music) (bed clattering) - Personal friend of yours? - No way, I hate that fucker and everyone else on that side of the world, because you never know when they're going to drop the big one. I mean, they're already screwing with the rain. 20 inches this year, when we're expecting 15. You got to watch those things. You watch those things? - No. - I watch 'em. - If anyone would like some bubbly later on, I've got a nice Perrier-Jouet '69. - How about a Bud Light? (clock ticking) - George, George, this your alarm clock ticking? - Holy shit. (explosion blasts) - The article seems to be helping in bringing in some new blood. (Chiba grunting) So what do you think of our new students, Father? (Chiba grunts) - Sensei. - What the fuck is this? - I don't know sensei. - You don't know? Some shit-ass school comes out of nowhere and I got to read about it in some fucking magazine? - I'm saying, I've never heard of that sensei. - Yeah? You get your ass over there and you find out what's going on. I want to know who's running this place. - All right. - Go, God damn it! (crickets chirping) (owl hooting) (people snoring) (door creaking open) (mysterious music) (bow smacks) (man yelps) - Lesson one. Learning to move is easy. Learning when to move is hard. (grunts) (calming music) - I see you found yourself a favorite. Do you think he's going to be worth the trouble? - Our young man is quite full of himself. First we empty cup, then we will see what is inside. (gentle music) (birds chattering) (dramatic music) (birds cawing) (camera shuttering) (music intensifies) (Chiba grunting and yelling) - Okay, first things first, we're going to start by getting everyone in shape. Follow instructions, and you'll make it through the week, no problem. Now! (people laughing) Let's see if you're properly dressed for morning run. - Good morning. - Aren't you going to change? - But I have. (guitar music) - I see.

What seems wrong may be right after all. - Who said that, Confucius? - No, Chiba. - You don't want me to look around? - Just ghosts from the past. - You don't have any ghosts that I know of. - We all have them, my flower, even me. (Josh yawning) - It's dawn. (people snoring) (birds hooting) (Josh snorts) (intense music) (stick smacks) - Ow! Ow! (Chiba laughing) (energetic music) - You understand? - I think you better show me one more time. (Chiba grunts) Okay I'll do them all.

Piece of cake. - You sure? ♪ Cupid, draw back your bow ♪ - Okay, now you have my undivided attention. (arrows thudding) Is that the best you guys can do? - Concentrate. - Chiba, baby, relax. (arrows flying) - Oh, what? A black belt now, hmm? - There's a Japanese saying: "A nail that sticks out must be knocked back in place." - [Phillip] All right, lads let's get him. - [Josh] Oh shit. (arrows flying and thudding) (Chiba laughing) - Okay, be careful. - Okay. - You got it. - I got it. - You're sure? - Positive. (explosion blasts) (twinkling music) (Claude coughing) - So what'd you find out? - That place is a dump, Sensei. They got some bimbo instructor there and 12 pathetic students. - A dump huh? So what the fuck are they doing number one? - Well you got the sensei in there? - Hey, no problema. Hey look at this one, Sensei. Oh, that one's personal. - What the fuck is this? What are you doing, Gonzales, jerking my chain here or what? (menacing music) Chiba. - No sensei, nunchucks. - That son of a bitch needs another lesson. And this time I'm going to hurt him real bad. (stick smacks) (Josh yells) - Goddammit. - Okay listen up, it's Friday and it's time we started putting it all together. Now you've done hand to hand and a few traditional weapons. It's a good foundation, but let's face it. There's a real world out there and your average, mugger's not coming at you with a shuriken or a sword, right George? - Affirmative. Kids nowadays are into semi-automatics with extended 25-round mags. - So we're going to have you taking out paint guns for practice. - Guns? - You, you, and you will be making up the home team with me. Now, these things sting a little so watch yourselves. No headshots, okay? Now this is compressed air, good for 10 to 12 shots. - So what about us, what do we get? - You get the real weapons. Now head on up the trail and give us half an hour to get set up here. - Ooh, real weapons. - Don't worry, I got something that'll give us an edge. (mysterious music) (George yells) (gunfire blasts) It's showtime. - Let's get this thing over with. - Wait, they expect us to take the path. Follow me, we'll flank them, rip their hearts out. - What? - Shh. - What?! - It's quiet, too quiet. - There's nobody within miles of here. (Claude yelling) - Hi. - Bang? - Well guys, we're almost there, back in one piece. - Shh. - Rattlesnake! (Lynn panicking) (paintball guns firing) (George yelling) - [Lynn] Ow! Ow! - Couldn't you have used pastels? (upbeat music) - Can you believe that? We got Lynn, we got Claude. (Suzy gasps) (Suzy yells) (romantic music) (Suzy sighs) - Suzy! (paint ball thuds) (dramatic music) Woops. (Suzy thuds) - Happens every time. (paint ball gun fires) - Bullseye. (dramatic music) - Gayle. (paintball gun fires) - She's mine. I'm going to blow her face away. (paintball gun fires) (George grunts) - Today's lesson is, a weapon's only as good as the one using it. (paintball gun fires) - You want to kiss and make up? - I'm hit. - You're dead. - Dead? - Dead, you're history pal. Buried, finished, kaput, finito, sayonara, get it? - [Suzy] Hey, what's he doing? - [Instructor] Shh, he's meditating. Excuse me, that's a really neat trick. (screaming) I think he needs to work on his concentration. (upbeat music) (men grunting and yelling) - I say. (Suzy giggles) - You know, days like these make me think. - I like your taste in decoration. - Decoration? It's insurance man. - Section eight, he's gone over the edge. (gentle music) (birds call) - Looking for a midnight snack? (sticks clatter) - I'm rigging myself an alarm system. - Why? - Why? Because Chiba keeps bopping my head, that's why. The guy is obviously a loon, and who the hell does he think that he is? - The sensei. - Well, he's straight out of Friday the 13th. Jason lives, trust me. - You think he's a little hard on you, is that it? - No, I like to hurt when I walk. - It's a privilege. - You don't have to tell me about privilege. I have led a privileged life, and it's $800 suits. It's having to dial nine to get an outside line from your house. - I'm sorry. - You're sorry? - Yes, you're obviously wasting your time here. - Well what about you, the loons assistant. - The loons daughter. (birds calling) - Hey Gayle. Look, I'm sorry. I haven't slept in a week and I'm starting to hallucinate. - I understand. I've been doing this since I was knee high. I realize it gets a little rough at times. - I can't figure you out. I mean, a girl with your looks and brains can really go far. You ever think of joining the real world? - Yeah, I gave it a shot a few years back. Didn't amount to much. (gentle music) I woke up one day realizing I was just going through the motions. That night, I was back training again. - And he took you back? - Of course, the prodigal daughter returns to the fold. He never said "I told you so", but you could tell that's what he was thinking. It was really rough the first couple of months. I mean in his eyes I'd been corrupted and he had to set things straight again. I'm glad I did it though. Gave me a new perspective on things. I'm with him from choice now. You know, he really likes you. - (laughs) No way. Remember me, I'm the guy he uses for batting practice. - Yes that's because he sees you as some sort of successor. - Really? - It's like the highest of gifts to the lowest of the low. Well, I'd better head on back to the house. I'm off with the advanced students in the morning. And you're stuck with Chiba. - No, not yet. - Why not? - Everything in its own time, you understand? - No, I don't. I'm an '80s guy. I like to rush things, I have to go for it. (Josh sighs) But I guess I don't have much choice, do I? I guess not. (small explosion blasts) Come on Claude, let's go to sleep. - Amazing how time flies. Two more days, I'll be back in service. - And I'm back to nine to five. - Or five to 10 with time off for good behavior. - What do you do, George? - Orange County chamber of commerce. - What about you? - I work with the atomic energy commission. - You got access to plutonium? (goofy music) - (sighs) Another couple of days guys, I think we're going to make it. (cans clattering) (men grunting and yelling) - All right now seven, and no-holds-barred. (dramatic music) (men grunting and yelling) - One, two, three, four, five, six. All right that's six, now where's... (strike smacks) (Adleman groans) - Gotcha, sensei.

I can just feel it. - What's up guys? - We're looking for Gayle. - She's gone with the advanced students on a survival exercise. Practice on your own. - Practice on our own.

Hey, Sensei, don't worry, we'll kick some ass. - Yes we will. And remember nobody touches the old Jap. He's mine. (Lynn panting) - [George] Th-th-th-there's a shit load of ninja' coming this way! - Cool, are they cute? - Cute? They're going to beat us up! Come on! (goofy music) (birds singing) - Get up asshole. (group clamoring and shouting) - Shut up! - I say. (dramatic music) - See, I told you! - Okay, back to camp. There's a small army heading this way, and we thought that you might like to join us for a little R and R in Burbank. - Go. We'll take you on the Universal Studios tour. - So long suckers. - Wait, Chiba's not going. - What? - This is not your concern, this is my fight. Go! - I'm staying. - Hey, come on guys, he wants us to go.
