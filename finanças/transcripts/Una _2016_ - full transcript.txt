You will be asked a number of questions by the solicitor who's in the court room upstairs. After each question, you must answer into the camera. Is that all clear? Can you give him a message? - Who? - Ray. Can you give him a message from me? That's completely out of the question. Ray? Where did you go? Why did you leave me? Ray, can you hear me? Okay, mate. See you, mate. Drive safely. Ppsssh! Ppsh! - Are you spying on us? - No. You're lost? I'm looking for Ray. You know him? No. What does he look like? What about my height young good-looking, yeah? It's uh... This man. Huh? That's Pete. Pete? Yeah. My boss. Should be right here somewhere. Pete! - Peter! - Yeah. - Can you take over for me? - Yeah. Come this way, please. Okay. In here. Can you close the door? - I don't want the door closed. - Close the door! How did you find me? - How did you get here? - I drove from where I live. Where I still live. What do you want? To see you. I can't fucking believe you drive here because of a photo. Why don't we just go outside, okay? You can say whatever you wanna say outside. What? Are you allergic to me? - Okay, fuck this. - Don't go. Fuck this. You stay away of me, you hear? Stay away. You need help. Ray. Ray! I don't know if it's you. If you are her. - I am, of course, I am. - No, I don't know that. - Yes, you did. - I didn't recognize you. - I still didn't recognize you. - Your face went white. You could be anyone. Couldn't you? I mean, you could be anyone. You could be a journalist. Your hair is different. A reporter. Could be anyone. How many other thirteen year old have you had sex with? None. You want to see my birth mark? You kissed it. And what you promised on the beach - a life together just you and me? None? Are you sure? - Hi. - Hello. Where are you headed? We are going to Europe. Just uh, me and Dad. And then, we're gonna catch the ferry. Yup, Dover to Calais, and then, who knows? Have a lovely time. Thanks. None. Just me? In that room? You're smiling. You've forgotten? Yeah. Yes, I had. What did you expect? If it had been six months later, you'd be on the sex offenders register. Ray would be on it. You wouldn't be allowed to forget. You wouldn't have a new life. - I served my time. - 4 years for what you did to me. My dad couldn't believe it. He was never the same again. He died a few years after. How? He fell. Tripped down some steps He thought you were his friend. He tried to find you. He knew where I was for the first 4 years. He wanted to hunt you down and kill you. - Hey, give me that! - No, stop. Shit, Jesus. You thought I come to kill you. I borrowed this from your dad. Can you give it back to him? You changed your name. Is that difficult? Random. Picked it out of a phone book. Peter. Peter what? I can ask outside. Travelian. Travelian. Peter Travelian? Where the hell did you get that from? From the "T". Peter Travelian? Are you fucking serious? Does that... command respect? Okay. What about the photos you took of me in your house? I got rid of them, I burned them all. I've seen those websites, those poor kids. - Never. - 10, 11, 12... - Never. - on beds, sofas... Those were sick bastards. I was never one of them. Is everything alright, Pete? Yeah, its all good man. Peter and I are just talking. I leave you to it. I was never one of them. You know I wasn't. Do I? Now, you all called me that. The public, the prisoners, the guards. I'd been spat on. I'd been beaten up. I had human shit put on my face. You know I wasn't. I don't know anything about you, except that you abused me. Didn't you? - Didn't you? - Yes, but... There is no "but". I was never one of them. You were my neighbor's daughter, not a target. You were looking at me. I always just wonder, if I hadn't argued with my friend, it could have been her you chose. It could have all happened to her, not me. You know what you did, then I'm not gonna tell you. Alright? Where is Lea? She went home. Una... I didn't choose you. A beautiful day. A smoke wouldn't kill you? Should we call a fire brigade? You'll be bored out your mind here. I've got boredom protection. I want one. Give me one. Go on. You're get me in trouble. How many people were at that barbecue? There were 10 or 15 people there, right? - Why? - Because... I had shorts on that day. - I had sh... - What? Yeah, they laughed about this in court, just about. You wore shorts? When in court, that was your defense? If I'd been aroused, if I had an erection, - If I'd been turned on... - Can you hear yourself? I stood there, next to you, drinking my beer in those shorts. I would have walked to where I would have sat down. Look, a person knows if they're aroused by children. Because they're always looking to be near them, to lure them, deceive them. The greater the risk, the bigger the thrill. - You seem to know a lot about it. - I talked to psychologists. There are patterns of behavior. Cycles, cycles of abuse. - Were you abused as a child? - For Gods sake! Not. And this is the exactly same thing that the lawyer asked me. He claimed the court would be more lenient if I had been abused. But I haven't. I'm not one of them. Mark is waiting for you. I have a meeting. I have to go. It's important. Okay. Why don't you wait in your car? - Peter! - Okay! - You know this is a big deal? - Yes. So listen, just... don't fuck it up. Okay, we want you moving ahead into the future with us. Yeah? Okay? Peter, you're okay? Good. Now, let's get in there. What are you doing here? You're a good swimmer. Oh. You wanna race? You bet. What are you doing this weekend? Uh... nothing much, actually. Who was that guy? Yeah, who was he? Just someone I know. Where did you meet him? Around. - Tell us! - Tell us! Come on. He is the neighbor. Friend of my dad. Let's go. Want a cup of tea? No, thank you. - Coffee? - No. We got champagne, Ice Cream, Caviar. Thank you. Listen, why don't we go there to meet him. Or at least to the reception. You shouldn't be here alone. I'm waiting for Peter. State your full name to the court, please. Ray? Where did you go? What happened? Why did you leave me? Ray, can you hear me? I love you. That does mean we need to consolidate several positions. Here at ETHGON, We believe in investing not just in ideas, but in people. I'll pass you over to Peter now. Thank you. - Yes. - And pay for that? It sounds like that. Yeah. Um... Right. Okay. So it's just like Jen said. We're uh, gonna be moving to working more with Northwest. And um... consolidating our futures together. New, new beginning. Um... Uh... I... I can't do this. They want me to um... to... give these six names. They want six names to let go. - Darryl... - Back to your place. Excuse me. I'm doing this. Darryl? Darryl! Bye. I'm sorry. And look, Frank Stokes. Excuse me. I'm sorry, mate. - Borris! - Fuck them! Peter! I'm gonna fucking kill him. Peter! Peter. You're fucking dead. Peter! Scott... What the fuck is wrong with Peter? Nothing. Hey? You think he's your friend? You're on his list. Yeah. You should empty out your locker. Get up. How long have you been married? I don't have time for this. Let's go. Four years. Do you have children? No. The poor woman, no idea who she's married to. - No idea what you did... - She knows. She knows? I have to go. How did she know? - How did she know? - Because I told her. And she was fine with it? Of course not, but I told her what my life was like then. - What was your life like then? - I had problems. Did you? Did you really? What kind of problems? I made the biggest, the most stupid mistake of my entire life. Did you tell her it was a three-month stupid mistake that you run away with me? I told her everything. - Because she loves me. - What's wrong with her? - There must be something wrong with her. - Don't speak of her like that. Why not? What the fuck is wrong with her? Pete! This is my life. I have to fight for this. I lost everything. Did you ever think about me? What was happening to me? You got out after four years. I've been living this for 15 years. Every fucking day! We never moved from that house! I was talked about, pointed at, stared at! I was attacked by your girlfriend! I lost my life. The only thing I didn't lose was my name. - Pete! - I had to keep my name. Peter! Peter? Pete! She attacked you? A couple of years later, I was shopping with my mum. She slapped me. Pushed me to the ground. She stayed silent. You glared at her. That you were after me. You used to hang around there, from the street, near the car. You wrote a note. She put it on my windshield wiper. "Your girlfriend is ugly." "Your Girlfriend got a glass eye." I'm ashamed of that stupid girl and the stupid crush. - You were not stupid. - I was. No, you weren't. You don't remember what you were like. What was I like? Very strong. Determined. Wise beyond your years. - No - Yes Yes. You were so impatient. Sick of being treated like a child. That's what children say. What could I have possibly given you that wasn't my body? What else could you have wanted? There was nothing else. There was. For me, there was. Do you remember the codes? I used to ring your parents' house - one ring It meant she'd gone out and you were on your own. Car parked facing right. Meet me in the park. I could not stop. I should have stopped. But you didn't. Whatever it was, whatever I was thinking,... made me believe... that I loved you. Crawling into those trees. And pulling up my top and touching my breasts. And unzipping your trousers and taking out your prick. Telling me to hold it. And on the blanket you brought... I thought it was to make us comfortable, but then I realized afterwards it wasn't, was it? It was so that twigs and earth wouldn't stick to my clothes. So no one would suspect. I didn't want us to get caught. Every waking moment was about how I could get closer to you. How to talk to you. I was obsessed with you. I still leave work early. I come home. I work on my car. My car didn't need work. I do it just so I could be near you. You remember. We both knew the risks. One of you seen Peter? Una? There were twin beds. Don't. Why not? We both know what happened. We were both there. We undressed. We had sex on one of the beds. I'm not sure how long for. And I saw how much pleasure I gave you. I liked that I could do that. We did it twice. Fucked... twice. You turned me around in the second time. We made so much noise. We lay in each other arms afterward, and I cried a bit. My parents were looking for me. That they were phoning my friends. I din't even know if I came. Did I come? I thought you did. How could you tell? Did I make a noise? What did I do? You uh, your eyes were closed, your face was flushed. You said you wanted cigarettes. You're going to look for a shop or pup. I wanted to go with you but you said "no". I was to wait there. And you touched me and kissed me between my legs. You'll be back in five minutes. I fell asleep, and when I woke up I didn't know what time it was. I was sober to my legs, but I felt wonderful. I was... I was so happy. And you'll be back soon and you'll have chocolates for me. I didn't even have to tell you what I wanted. You know what I wanted and you bring it to me. I waited for you in that room, but you never came back. What are you doing? This room is private. What are you wanting? I looked for you in the town. And I looked everywhere. I couldn't find you. Did a man come having cigarettes? - What? - About an hour ago. - A man having cigarettes? - I'm sorry, my love. Hey, you can't be in here, my love. - I'm looking for my dad. - Whats his name? Ray. This girlie is looking for her dad - Ray. We got Ray in the bar? When did you last see him, love? Oh, my God. I felt sick. I wanted to die. I was never going to see you again. Ray! Ray! Ray! I didn't say anything to anyone. I didn't say a word. I told them you hadn't touched me. And that I ran away. And they asked me what you'd done to me. When I wouldn't say, they told me what you'd done to me They drugged me and held me down, opened my legs and took out your cum. They said you were only after one thing, And when you got what you wanted, that's why you disappeared. I hate... the life I had. You wouldn't know any of that, but I wanted you to know. Peter? Peter? - Can you go out of it, please? - Oh, I am sorry. I came back. - What? - I didn't leave you. I came back. - A chocolate. - Okay. Twenty five. Thank you very much. - Thank you. - Lovely Okay. - Thanks. - Have a good one. Bye. I needed a drink, I needed courage, because... We were really doing it. We would getting on a ferry, we were running away. Same again, mate? So, you... I just... I just needed to clear my head. So I went for a walk around the streets. And then,... And then, I came back She told me you were gone. Just run off. I went to the car. Yelled out for you. Dark as I thought, maybe, you were hiding. But nothing. And I mean... I thought in panic, where would you go? Why would you go? I didn't know what the fuck was going on? It didn't make any fucking sense. Then I thought, maybe, someone got you. That you were being hurt. That I hadn't protected you. Can I get a whiskey, mate? A double. You got a daughter? Yeah, I do. Yeah. Why? Have, have you seen her? Well, have you lost her? Yeah. So, what are you doing here for then? Did she say where she was going? What's your name? - What's your name, mate? - Come here! Hey! But, I didn't leave you. That's what the lawyer said because he said it might sound better in court. That I was disgusted with myself, so I ran away. It's not true. I didn't. I came back for you. I'd like to um... report a missing person. Pardon me? A missing person. Leaving me there, coming back, there is no difference. Yes, there is. For me, there is. Pete! Peter! - What's going on? - The lights. They're locking up for the day. We can not stay here. Are you expected home? Yeah. I am. Did you tell your wife... that you were coming back for me, that... you wouldn't have left me there? No. You haven't told her, have you? Anything? How could I? - You don't think she should be told? - I don't think we should talk about it. - Can I meet her? - Don't be stupid. - How old is she? - She's a year older than me. Is she sexy? Does she turn you on on that sagging skin? What does she like best? You're unwell, you know that? You need help! You're sick! - I'm not! - You are fucking ill. - I'm not. - You are fucking... - I'm not... - Well. sick! - I'm not... - Oh! Shhh!!! Come here. I started at 6:30 this morning. What do you do? Have you got a job? Just office work. It's nothing earth shatterings. Not what I wanted to do. What do you want to do? I don't know. It's something else. Do you still live with uh... with your mum? If she knew I was here... You have a boyfriend? No. I did think to about you, growing up. What you'd be like. I never wanted to hurt you. Did you think about me then? So I have of you. Hugging you. Touching you. And fucking me? Do you masturbate? Do you come? Yeah. I can't. I want you doing it. No. Why not? I can't be with you. Am I too old? Pete? Oh, shit. - What? - Pete, what the fuck, man? Wait. What? What the fuck? Huh? - What do you mean "what"? - What the fuck! - Hey. - You fucking gave them my name. You got me fired? What? Who told... No, hold on. Who told you that? - Fucking Mark! - Mate, he's lying. - He's lying. - He told me to fucking empty my locker. - He's liar? - Look! Look! Look! Your name is not on that. That's the list. Mark's a liar. Please, just get her. Get her out of here. Lock up. Please. Can you do that? Just, just get her out of here. Alright, we got to go. You can't stay here. Where is he? Ray! He's gone.
