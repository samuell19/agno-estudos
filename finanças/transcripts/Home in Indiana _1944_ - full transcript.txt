liquor that's all there is to it don't you worry none about me I don't want to be butting in and asking questions I shouldn't damn penny but what happened between him and mr. bull well boy some men folks quarrel over women let's go Don Thunder it was a horse a mayor to a racing man more precious than any beautiful woman it all happened a long time ago they was partners and business together and they were friends great friends but thunder was the honester of the two there was an important race with a mayor in it godo said a heap of star on that mares of win in that race but something happened to one of her legs and she lost and go dawn never even waited to get back to the stables to shoot her and when Thunder saw that mares glazed eyes looking up at him he just went crazy and he beat go door right there leave my most killed him that was the beginning godo set out to ruin thunder took all these horses away from Roundhouse Thunder tried hard to fight him back all he needed was money enough to keep Roundhouse a-going and he figured on winnin that in the next big race everybody knew we had a better horse and god√µs and the folks at that race just sheared like fury for thunder and the crowd was just about lifting him and his horse right off the ground with their voices but he lost the race seems like after that he lost everything he couldn't even win a foot race against a fence post but he kept his pluck and till it seemed as if God was trying to convince him that he favoured go da bull and then his spirit snapped into you don't have to tell you no more you're seeing the rest of yourself you mean after 18 years he still feels like that 18 years or 80 a racing man never changes how I feel but all that if the stables were fixed up and there were Falls again and horses
