Well, if it isn't my great friend, the Blonde Buffalo! Oh, Cachirula! How odd for us to meet here! And where do you think you're going? I'm going home! Aww! He wants to go home! - Did you hear that, Estrella? - Of course, Cachirula. He misses his family, poor thing! So... - Can I go home? - No! Ungrateful thing! On this island, I've given you everything! Everything! - Everything! - Everything, but...freedom! Ungrateful buffalo! Soon, you'll regret wanting to leave me. Dollies! Take him away! Let me go! No! Cachirula! You said I could leave whenever I want! Cachirula, remember that Uncle Bald is waiting for you. That horrible animal trafficker! Cachirula! My dear Cachirula! You're going to be so excited, because I bring you very good news! I don't care! Those things you bring me are all a bunch of ungrateful things! They don't want to be my friends! Oh, poor thing! I'll just bring you very obedient animals from now on, I swear! - I'll take their brains out, if necessary! - Enough! I don't want more animals! You've already brought them all! All of them, but one. And I mean the most treasured animal on earth: the Juanín. You've never been able to find him, incompetent bald eagle! And without him, my collection is worth nothing! Nothing! That's exactly what I came to tell you, Cachirula! I found a Juanín! Yes! He's the last and only Juanín! And he's the most expensive ever! I'll pay anything, but don't take your time! I want my Juanín, I want my Juanín, and I want my Juanín, now! Your wish is my command, Cachirula. Finally, my collection will be complete! Sweet Juanín, soon, you will be my Juanín!

A gift? Seriously? I wasn't expecting that! Go ahead, Juanín. Tulio, on this birthday, I wanted to express my respect for you, as my boss and my friend. Bring it out! As a picture worth a thousand words, I'll tell you what I think of you, with this gift. IDIOT Cut! The popularity of the news anchor has fallen by more than 90%, being at a lower level than common criminals and the advice-giving walrus. Beat him! Beat him harder! Beat him! Children no longer respect him, and it's most likely that his news channel will lose all of its prestige. And all because of a painting. It is said that the news anchor got a very crude painting today. That's why he'll be known as the Big Idiot. The Big Idiot. Juanín! This has been the most humiliating moment in my life! Your prank has gone too far, and I demand an explanation! - But Tulio, that painting... - Don't talk to me about that painting! - But, that painting wasn't what I- - Enough! I don't even want to talk about that painting ever again! - Tulio! Where do we put the painting? - Yeah! Where, where? Take that hideous thing from here, and trash it away! Oooh, alright... Juanín! This is unbearable, unacceptable, unexplicable, unattainable, un- Unflappable? - Unflappable? - Sorry. You wanna keep on mocking me? My humiliation wasn't completely... ...unflappable enough for you? What's this? It's the gift I made for you... with my own hands, buddy. Enough with the jokes! Juanín, you... You're fired! I'm... I'm fired? I don't have another choice. Goodbye. - But Tulio! That painting... - Goodbye, Juanín. Juanín, are you gone? Juanín? Uncle Tulio, we've found something really serious! Cam the Security Camera recorded something very suspicious. Gentlemen, this is what I saw. That's just an ordinary coffee machine. Oh, I'm secretly in love with her, and I observe her all the time... Go fast forward, Cam! Oh, okay. Sorry for opening my heart. This is what I saw in the warehouse. I never watched that dumb TV And I'm very stinky Why, I'm a great painter! - It can't be! - What? What? That's the dangerous criminal, Uncle Bald! He's a scoundrel, dishonest wrongdoer, and villainous scoundrel. There hasn't been another kingdom of crime like his. You really are a great journalist, Bodoque. - How did you know all of that? - This crossword of famous criminals. So, that guy ruined the painting! But why, why, why? - Why? - What does it matter? That means Juanín is innocent! Juanín! Juanín! Juanín's no longer here... No... I... I was so angry at him... ...that I just fired him. What? Well, if it isn't Mr. Juanín Juan Harry, the great producer! Great producer? I don't think so. Tulio just fired me. That foolish chimp never gave you enough credit. Allow me to introduce myself. I'm Uncle Bald, owner of my own television network. And I want to hire you! Look! Now he's with Juanín! Me? Work at another station? Why not? Nobody here cares about you! True... Follow me to the port, where I have my office. Yes! That evil guy's taking him away to the port! Quick! We have to catch up! Juanín! Juanín! Juanín! Chill out, Tulio. Maybe it reassures you to know that this is all your fault. Look! Uncle Tulio's painting! It sure was beautiful... - Any problem, civilians? - It's the police! - Yay! - Bravo! Bravo! Hey! Could you explain why did you put us in jail? Ahh! Don't play with me, clowns! You know very well that I got ya here, for the murder of Lord Warmington Banquete! Everything was confirmed when I found out that Lady Penelope Banquete, was actually Monsieur Henry de la Florete's lover, Floyd the gardener's close friend, and his elder father... Where am I? In my room? Yes. Yer all guilty! But you wouldn't have done it without telling the leader's genius, no less than... Higgins, the butler. My name is Tulio Triviño! Ahh! Of course! It's the idiot from the painting! How did I not recognize ya? But if that's the case, then who killed Lord Warmington Banquete, who disappeared on the 20th of July under strange circumstances? No one murdered me. I am Lord Warmington Banquete, and I've been locked up here since the 20th of July, for drunkenness. Look, noodle-head. Break us free. We have to save a friend in great danger! Shoulda said sooner! Quick! To the police car! Extra! Extra! The cops are kind to people! Extra! Extra! Criminal! Come in and meet everyone at the TV studio, J.J.! They're of the highest technical and human level! - Impressive! - Go ahead! Excuse me. Where's Juanín? Where's Juanín? Leave him to a specialist. The wind's blowing from North to East. It's a cloudy day, a pelican eats a fish... That hurts, man! Therefore, Juanín's right over there. - How did you know? - Cuz of the sign. Ahh! - Police! Stop him! - Sorry, dudes! I've got another urgent mission to do! - Let's go, gals. - Let's go, Guaripolo! We must save him! - Faster, Captain! Faster! - Tulio! I got you! Yes! Plaster! Patana! What are you doing here? - It's too dangerous! - Don't let go, Uncle! Ow! My tailbone! Juanín! Cachirula, your Juanín's on his way. Nothing can stop him now. Wonderful, Baldy Boy! His beautiful room is ready! - Just a little perfume, Cachirula. - Yes! That! What a nice vacation Juanín's gonna enjoy in that cruise... - I greatly envy him! - Oh, shut up, old man! Aw, we were useless! I'm the only responsible for this tragedy! Cry later, Tulio. We'll get him back. - I don't know how. - Hold on! If I recall correctly, Tulio has a yacht! Oh! Right! But I never used it before... Never? Why not? Because of whales. The sea is infested with whales that gobble up ships. Yes! Whales! Hundreds of thousands of whales who want to devour me alive! They all want to devour me! All of them! But Tulio, that's a myth! Whales don't eat ships, but they feed on tiny microscopical creatures. It's true! Should've known sooner! I wouldn't have kept that yacht there for more than 20 years! - 20 years? - 20 years? - Twice a year? - Yep, but no worries! The yacht's in mint condition! Follow me. Let's go after Juanín! You must be hungry, White Boy... This is the only thing I found to eat. Here. Salt? Hey! At the other station where I worked, I got better food! Don't you even realize, No-eyed Whitey? This ain't no TV station! I brought you bamboozled and now you're my prisoner! - Why are you laughing? - Because you're laughing! I'm laughing because I'm evil and I won! You should be crying because I'm taking you far away! So far away, and you'll never return! - Where are you taking me? - I can't tell you. But I'll give you a hint. Let's go to a place that starts with a Z. A Zoo Island? Oh! You better gobble the food. I hope it's not so salty... Here it is, folks! This is the S.S. Tulio. The Beast of the Twelve Seas. I'd say, The Scrap of the Twelve Seas. I'm so sad, and so lonely... No... You're not alone... You're not alone! Cuz I'm here too... Who are you? I'm Don Vicente Arthur Gordon Norman Donald Boy. But you can call me Bob. Oh! Nice to meet you! I am Juanín. Juanín Juan Harry. Oof! What a long name! Watcha doin' in my beautiful house? I've been kidnapped... I'd help you escape, but I'm too small... I'd better cook ya somethin' to go with your salt. Follow me, kiddo! Look, Uncle Tulio! All the employees from the TV station came to help! Oh! All aboard! All aboard! Everyone but Patana. - But Uncle Tulio... - No buts, my dear niece. I'm your uncle and I won't allow you in this dangerous journey. - But I can help you too, Uncle! - Help me? Ha! You're just a little girl, Patana! Stay on the dock, where it's a jillion times safer! You got things ready? Lady! Come! Hey! Look at my car! Hey, lady! Look! Pockets! Pockets! Get your pocket, only a buck! Patana! I'll help you out on this journey. Come with me. Thanks a lot, Mario Hugo. Sometimes a helpless girl like me needs a man like you. A man...like me?

There's nothing better like The life at the sea Life at the sea Life at the sea Facing big dangers in The sailing spree The sailing spree The sailing spree We're fishing for anchovies I don't care but pepperoni On a mission for a friend We are sailing 'til the end There's nothing better like The life at the sea Life at the sea Life at the sea There's nothing better like The life at the sea Life at the sea Life at the sea - Where are you going, kiddo? - To a place that starts with a Z. - Oh, Cachirula's Zoo Island? - Cachirula? Yeah, they say she's a spoiled little millionaire girl. She has a horrible zoo, where no one ever comes back alive from there! Cachirula collects the world's weirdest animals. - What kind of species are you? - I don't know. I just know I'm a Juanín. A Juanín? Where are you from, Juanín? I remember very well... Two young scouts of the Apumanque Patrol were hiking the Forest Woods. They kept walking for hours, and they couldn't find their way back. Patrolman Tulio, I think we're lost. Are you sure you looked at the map? Map? This isn't a map! This is my self-portrait picture! - Bad monkey! Now we're really lost! - Lost? Oh no, Officer Bodoque! Save me! - Juanín... - Oh! What was that? - Oh, look! - Juanín. Juanín. Juanín, Juanín, Juanín. What an odd-looking weirdo! I've never seen one like it! - Juanín. - Me neither. We gotta go. But, Tulio, we can't just leave him here in the woods! We gotta take him with us. - Oh, all right! - Juanín. Juanín! Juanín! Juanín! - Shut up, Juanín! - Juanín. That's it! His name will be Juanín! - Juanín! - Ohh! From that day, Tulio and Bodoque became my best friends. And when we grew up, they offered me a job as their TV news program's producer. They soon became very famous. I worked there happily for years, and years... ...and years, and years, and years... What good friends! They're surely looking for you! I don't think so. We had a fight, and now they must've forgotten me. Impossible! If they're real friends, they'll never give up the search! - Let's stop the search! - We'll never catch up to him... Let's go home! You're right. We better go back home and forget... BUDDIES Enough! Juanín is a great employee, and he would've sacrificed for me, and so do you guys! We must continue! We must follow and face all the dangers we encounter! Never forget our mission: bring our friend back home! But, Tulio, you don't even know how this thing works! We've been sailing in circles for hours... Oh, it's true. No one knows how to sail the yacht! - We'll have to go back... - Hold on a sec! I know how to sail a yacht! They taught me at school! - What a modern and awesome school! - Excellent education! Such excellent training! Patana! I forbade you to come, as it was really dangerous! So get out of this boat right now, and go swim back to the shore! But, Tulio, don't be ridiculous! Patana can lead us to Juanín! That's right! With your permission, Uncle. I've got a boat to catch! Bravo! Yay! Hooray! Bravo! Buckle up for safety! Patana, regarding what we were talking about how you need a man... I... just wanted to say, maybe we could- Nothing better like The life at the sea Life at the sea Life at the sea Winning some money It's the place to be The place to be The place to be Top top top top top top top top top top top! Bad guys' ship on the horizon! Uh-oh! - Uh-oh, what? - They're chasing us. Oh, it's them! - Those lousy meddlers! - Meddlers! Honestly, I think you're right... Maybe your friends aren't looking for you. I told you... Juanín! And the worst thing is they got mad at me for a crime I didn't commit. Everybody says the same. I hope Cachirula doesn't find out about this... Oh! It's her! It can't be! I hate Cachirula so much! Hello, dear Cachirula! Hello, beautiful Baldy Boy! Tell me, when's my li'l Juanín coming here? He'll be there soon. Very soon! - Dude, they caught us! - Shut up! Caught you? Who caught you? No! No one! Nobody! Juanín! It's just Juanín's insignificant friends! - What? - They're chasing us! Idiot! I knew I couldn't trust you. Oh, wait a minute! I just came up with an evil plan! Near my island, there's the terrible Sea of Mighty Winds. Whoever enters those waters will never come out again! Take those nasty people to there immediately! And remember, I want my Juanín! How do I send those pesky pests to the Sea of Mighty Winds? Just leave it to me! Hold on tight, dude! Juanín! - Must've been my imagination. - Mine, too. - Top top top top top top... - What's going on, Policarpo? This smoke is too dense! I can't see beyond my hands! That's because you have very short arms. Oh! Now what do we do? Trust my avian sense of direction, Uncle Tulio! Because of it, we won't get lost! - So long, suckers! - Suckers! Nothing better like The life at the sea Life at the sea Life at the sea Winning some money It's the place to be The place to be The place to be Wake up! C'mon, Snow Dude! Your time has come! Bye, Juanín! I'd go with you but... I'm too small! Let's go. Juanín! Juanín! I'll do my best to save you! I promise! Don't make any promises, Bob. I don't believe in friendship anymore... Now I only believe in evil... And rightly so, Johnny! Oh! Juanín! - He's waking up! - He's so white! I'm scared! I'm scared! - I'm scared! - Hey! Hey! What an ugly weirdo! I can't see his eyes! Stop! Stop! Let him breathe! - Go to your positions! - I'm scared! - It's about to start! - I'm scared! Come on, Juanito! Get up! Hurry! Over here! I'm scared! I'm scared! I'm scared! So scared! I'm the great Cachirula- Useless dolly! I told you to fix this thing! I'm gonna pull out your strings, one by one! And then I'm gonna- My Juanín! Sweet and cute Juanín, come to me! I hope you had a great trip, Juanín! Great trip? This bald guy brought me on a stinking ship! He kidnapped me! Baldy! You kidnapped Juanín? No no no no no, Cachirula! There's some confusion! This poor Juanín was abandoned by his friends! - Abandoned! - And I thought you could help him! That's why I brought him on the first ship I could find! Can't you see I'm a really nice guy? Is that true, Juanín? Your friends abandoned you? Well, yeah... They kicked me out. Forget about them! From now on, I'll be your friend! And you'll live with me, in my wonderful paradise! Paradise? But they told me this was a sinister zoo. This is not a zoo, Juanín! This is the most complete private collection, of the weirdest and most valuable animals in the whole world! And with you, the collection is now complete! - Bravo, Cachirula! - Complete! Complete! My collection is complete! This animal is dirty! Dollies, clean him up! Pardon me, Cachirula! Hi! I'm Huachimingo! Welcome! Oh! Hey, Huachimingo! Say, what are we supposed to do? Nothing. Just stay around and put a smile to your face! - But...there's no working here? - No. - No working? - No! Absolutely no working, Juanín, because your fur gets dirty! And if it gets dirty, it's worthless! Remember now you're part of my collection! Oh, my! Well, dearest animals... You can go rest. You deserve it! - Yeah! - I'm scared! I'm scared! Huachimingo, please show Juanín his new room. - So, you don't get bored of anything? - Yeah, but what does it matter? We've been chosen to be here because of our value. Understand? It's a great honor to be part of Cachirula's collection! You're right, I'm valuable here, and they really love me! - How did you get here, Huachimingo? - It was a long time ago! I just remember getting hit in the head and then I woke up here. - Lucky me, right? - And no one ever left? Well, only one animal left this beautiful place. - Really? - Cachirula said he went back to his home! - What animal was it? - The Blonde Buffalo. We've never heard of him again! Ohh! No! Don't go in there! No animal is supposed to go through this door! - Why? - That's Cachirula's private place! It is forbidden for us! - C'mon! Follow me! - Sure! Here's your room, Juanín. See ya on the next exhibition! - Rest well! - Bye, Huachimingo! Policarpo, you see the ship? Oh, I'm sorry, folks. I lost them! Oh, we'll never know where they took Juanín... Only a miracle can help us now. Oh! It's a miracle! Miracle! The yacht's got a TV! Eh-heh-heh-heh-heh! Boing! Boing! Boing! Boing! Boing! Boing! Hello, kids! It's the old and beloved Uncle Horacio! And here are my new cigarettes, designed especially for you! It's just that stupid Uncle Horacio's show. Turn it off! What? Oh yeah, I'll start. I'll start. Kids, today in this special moment of The Uncle Horacio Show... ...I want to show you a lovely little girl, who has done the best thing you can do to animals... ...imprison them! Eh-heh-heh-heh-heh! This week, we visited the exotic Cachirula Island, where we found a collection of the weirdest animals in the world. I know you'd want to visit, but you can't. The animals there lead a comfy life... ...and they get the best and most exaggerated care. The owner is the millionaire, Cachirula, who'll share us with some big news. That's right, folks! I just completed my exotic collection, with the most exotic animal of them all! The Juanín! It can't be, Tulio! It's Juanín! Juanín? I bought him legally, and now he's all mine! He's very happy here, now that he found his true friends! Shameless! He's having fun while we almost died for him! - It's a fantastic and convenient place to be! - Lucky him! What are you guys talking about? Juanín's at a zoo, don't you realize? Perhaps he lives in a golden cage, but a golden cage, is still a cage! What a great line! Write it down, Mario Hugo. That Cachirula girl tricked Juanín. She's an evil collector! And collectors will do anything to get what they want! That's true! We must find that island and save Juanín! Well, Cachirula... I think it's about time for payment! Payment, huh? You sure you got rid of Juanín's friends? Those suckers will never escape the Sea of Mighty Winds! So... no witnesses to our despicable acts? Not even one! Now, if you were kind enough to give me my- Wait! There's still a witness who knows everything! - Oh, who? - You! No! Coffee, sir? Anyone need a cup? No water left! Watch out! Brace yourselves! Look out, buddy! Thanks, Bodoque! You saved my life! - Top top top top... - Bodoque? Rabbit overboard! Help me! Throw something real quick! Useless junk! Throw something floating! Uncle Bodoque! Grab the rope! Hey, buddy! Grab this! It's the same rope, you foolish monkey! Bodoque! Bodoque! Aye, Captain! Thunderstorm! This is so boring... I've got an idea! Huachimingo, are you sure you know how to use the camera? Uh, I think so! Hi there, folks! Welcome to Juanín's report! From Cachirula's castle! Follow me, Cammy! Ah! Look at him! This is Charanguito. Charanguito, say a few words for Juanín's report. Hi! Tell us Charanguito, how are you? Hi! Hi! Hi! Hi! - I'm scared! I'm scared! - Hi! Who came up with this ridiculous game? Yes, who? Repeat: who came up with this ridiculous game? Repeat: yes, who? Bye! Juanín! I have to scold you... ...but now I'm really tired. I'll be waiting for you at my office tomorrow at seven! Yes, at seven. Bodoque! Bodoque! Bodoque! - Bodoque! - It's no use, Uncle Tulio! Uncle Bodoque's been lost at the sea... I'll never forget his last words: "It's the same rope, you foolish monkey!" Something's approaching! It's a whale! And it's coming straight to us! - He wants to devour us! - Don't be ridiculous! Whales don't eat ships, but feed on tiny, microscopic creatures- I told you for the last time, Juanín: you can't work here! So if you work, you'll waste your value. Do you want to stop being valuable? I'd rather spend myself a little and not get bored so much. Isn't it that you still miss your old life, Juanín? Do you want to go back? Go back? But no one gets out of here! I was told one animal did go back home: the Blonde Buffalo. Yes, it's true. He left, but he made a mistake! His friends didn't forgive him! Just like you! B... But perhaps they could forgive me! They have nothing to give you for! You were a slave to 'em! Whereas here, you're the most valuable member of my collection! The most valuable? Of course! You're worth much more than all your friend together times 12! That's why they envied you! Come here, Juanín. Look at the ocean. Empty. Like the heart of those who didn't even come after you! Forget about them, like they did with you! Patana. Patana! I think this is the right time to tell you... Silence, Mario Hugo, we must find a way to get out of here! Impossible! All we have left is to wait for our death! Got any matches? Yes, me! Oh! It's Uncle Bald! Oh no! It's them! Don't hit me! I'm Cachirula's victim too! She threw me into the sea! He doesn't seem to be lying. Let him go! We forgive you. Only if you take us to that island! Oh yeah, sure! But first, we must get out of this whale. You fools! We'll never get out of here! Never! Of course we will! Through the whale's breathing hole! - Yeah, true! - No way! I'm not coming! Oh, Uncle Tulio. You must leave to save Juanín. You owe it to Uncle Bodoque! Bodoque...how I miss him! Hush! He's waking up! Thanks for saving my life! Yes! We saved your life... ...just to kill you! Kill! Kill! Kill! Oh, finally! The whale's hole! Now we just need to wait to be pushed out! Wait a minute. This isn't the hole from where the whale breathes! This is the hole from where- Ow, my tailbone! Oh! Lucky! We reached the island! - Tulio... - Hates me! - Cachirula... - Loves me! Good job, Juanín! See how easy it is to understand? Cachirula, we have guests! It can't be! Those are my friends! What? I mean... ex-friends! And Baldy's guiding them! - What? And now, I'll lead you to the dangerously evil castle! Dangerously evil? Well, I think I'll stay here and guard the beach. Oh, yes! We need to swipe all this sand! Cowards! I'll go alone! This is shameful! We can't let Tulio go alone like that! Not without encouraging him! Alabio! Alabao! Alabim, bom, bao! Tulio! Tulio! Rah! Rah! Rah! Long live the groom! The Huachimingo people condemn this evildoer... ...to an immediate death for his terrible crime! Crime? But I never committed any crime! Oh yeah? The police thinks otherwise! That's right, you lousy kidnapper! Ugh, this can't be happening. I've chased you with the stealth of a fox. And now at last, the time for justice has come! But what am I accused of? Don't play dumb, dummy! You know great you kidnapped a Huachimingo, and took him away forever. Ahh! Poor Huachimingo... Let's kill him! Now, following the Huachimingo law... ...you'll pay for your crime, wicked Uncle Bald. Huh? Uncle Bald? I'm not even Uncle Bald! This guy is Uncle Bald. Well, uh... Excuse me. I think I have another important mission! C'mon, Sopapiglobo. Huachimingos! Execution canceled! And the party begins! Chief, I think I know where your missing Huachimingo is at. This way! We're here, Tulio! And now, shout "traitor!" - Why? - Cuz I'm out! Traitor! Now what do I do? Looks like no one's home. Well, mission failed, time to go home. Who knocks on the door of the generous Cachirula? I... I'm Tulio Triviño, the important journalist. I demand to speak with Juanín Juan Harry. And even if it rains, or snow, or even if no climate change occurs, I'll stand here until I see my friend. Juanín? That's no problem! Here's Juanín! Juanín! Quick! Let's get out of here! You've got lotsa stuff to do! Iron my ties, waking me up early and... No, Tulio! I'm not coming back! But... What are you talking about, Juanín? - This evil girl has you cheated here! - No, Tulio, you have cheated me. You made me think you were my friend, and now... ...you want me to come back cuz you can't stand to see me succeed. You're jealous! I don't want to see you ever again, ex-friend! Well done, Juanín! Now, what? Juanín! Don't listen to that impostor! I'm the real Cachirula and I order you to go back with your real friends! Ta-da! That's enough, Juanín! Make your choice! Him or me! What do you want now, Tulio? I... I just wanted to say sorry, Juanín. I shouldn't have fired you, and yes, maybe I took advantage of you. That painting was right... I'm an idiot. I hadn't realized how important you are. Life's not the same without you... Come back. Well... I... Unfortunately, visit time's over. I'll give you 15 minutes for you and your people abandon my island! Get him out of here, immediately! Take it, Juanín, remember it! Remember it! You still have a choice, Juanín! You have freedom! Freedom! Juanín! Contact with that rat has made you dirty! Go take a bath and put some perfume on! And you, Estrella, make sure they leave! Right away, Madam. Hey! Let me go! Let me go! Let me go! Top... Top... What's going on, Policarpo? While you were looking for Juanín, we formed a new civilization based on peace and love. I am their god. Top... Top... Enough, buffoons! I found Juanín. Huh? He's doing well. Yeah! Very happy. Yeah! But he doesn't want to come back with us. Aww... Becuase he says we're jealous. Ooh... So we have to go back home. Yeah! Without completing our mission. Aww... And move on with our lives! Yeah! Without Juanín. Aww... BUDDIES Look, guys! Some canoes! And... Bodoque's on one of them! Yeah! Your best friend Cachirula speaking! I want to see my collection, so get to the yard in five minutes! Quick! Quick! Let's go! Oh! Ooh! Only one animal left this beautiful place. The Blonde Buffalo. We've never heard of him again! Blonde Buffalo... Yes, Juanín. I killed him. Because he didn't want to be my friend. I don't either! Then, you must die! No! I wanna live! Dollies! Capture Juanín! Ooh! What's going on? Guys! Guys! This is a trap! Cachirula is a murderer! Let me go! Let me go! Poor Juanín... Don't listen to him. He was getting showered, but he swallowed shampoo, and went crazy! So, we'll do an emergency surgery. - Excuse me. - Cachirula! You're lying! Juanín would never swallow shampoo! Therefore, all this is a trap! Don't let him escape! Buddy, buddy... Tulio! There's no time for this! Help! - Help! Help! Help! - Oh! Huachimingo! Oh! Huachimingos! I insist! There's no time for reunions! He's right! Juanín's in big trouble! Cachirula's gonna kill him because he swallowed shampoo, but Juanín didn't swallow shampoo! Juanín? All because of a shampoo? I'll offer Cachirula to pay for the shampoo! That's one of Cachirula's lies, chimp-face! Let's go to the castle! Uh-oh, Cachirula's not gonna like this. Now, dear Juanín, I'll chop your head off, and I'll put it on the wall as a decoration. But...why? Because heads don't escape nor betray their best friends! Your problems won't end there, Cachirula. There'll always be animals that want to be free, and try to escape your terrible collection. You're right... But since I'm a genius, I found the solution! No animal will ever abandon me again because... ...I'll chop every animal's heads off! It's not my fault, dear friends! I wanted to let you live! But Juanín made me change my mind. Make sure you thank him. Thank you, Juanín! Cachirula! Juanín's friends are at the doors of the castle! How longer must they bother me? Estrella, stand guard here. I'll take care of them. And if Juanín moves, you chop his head off! With pleasure. We want Juanín! We want Juanín! We want Juanín! We want Juanín! I don't know if this is the right time, Patana. But I wanted to tell you that I... Never mind. Cachirula! Leave Juanín and the rest of the animals free, and we'll leave peacefully! We've got you surrounded! Surrounded? Oh, help me, help me! I'm being attacked by a bunch of ragdolls! Leave, or you'll be squashed like cockroaches! Oh. Okay then... Glad you asked for it, Cachirula. The war starts now! Yeah! War? My favorite game! Patana! How do I look? I forgot to tell you that Cachirula has a humongous killer army! And what do we have? What do we have? A magician that explodes. Here! Over here! It's me, I'm here- Oh, why, it's just some dollies! Oh, mommy! What's that? The Huachimingos summoned all the species that suffered from Cachirula's kidnappings. We've got reinforcements! We are the Blonde Buffaloes and we couldn't stay out of this noble battle! We are the Melancholic Toads and we couldn't stay out of this noble battle. Let's battle! We are the Insomniac Jackals, and we couldn't stay out of this noble battle! We are the Kind-hearted Butterflies, and we couldn't stay out of this- United people, attack! Don't run away, coward! Help! Don't worry, Tulio, it's just a matter of time. How long has it been? One minute. This is the best thing that's ever happened to me! For justice! We must get into the castle and free the animals, now that Cachirula's distracted! Let's go! Ow, I'm scared... We're defeating them! It's the most beautiful day of my life! Uh-oh! Time to use my secret weapon! Crush them into dust! Ow, my tailbone! Come on! Coast is clear! Come on, don't get separated! - No way! A zoo! - Shut up, monkey. They're defeating us! I don't wanna die! Ta-dah! I'm here! Aww... And I brought some pals! Ta-dah! Nils Sergio Svenson Lars Ebano It's just the tiny Muscular Men. No worries! They'll defeat the Dollies with their best weapon... Love. Music, please. It can't be! Yeah! Estrella, don't wait any longer! Chop off Juanín's head immediately! As you wish, ma'am. Quick! Quick! - Juanín! What are you doing there? - Tulio! Bodoque! They want to cut my head off! Too late, White Boy. - Now let's get outta here! - But first, we have to save the animals! What are you waiting for? Now you're free! Free! Yeah! Get out of the cage, stupid heads. That's what freedom means. Let's get out of here! Come on! Faster! I forgot something! Guys, you've done it too! Oh, yes! We rescued Juanín, and... Where's Juanín? The card... Just the two of us again, Juanín. - Top top top top top top... - What's the matter, Policarpo? Cachirula's taking Juanín! Over there! After her! We'll never make it... If only there was a shortcut. Here's a shortcut! Yes! For just a single buck, you can use it and save- C'mon! There she is! Stop right there, Cachirula! We've defeated you. What? Me? You still can't tell how selfish I am? If I'm not happy, then no one can be happy! One more step, and I'll throw Juanín into the sea! And all of your ridiculous attempts at a rescue will be useless! Useless! Does anyone have anything else to say? I repeat: does anyone have anything else to say? Patana! I loved you since the day I met you! But we're just friends, Mario Hugo! My niece is too young and I forbid her to have a boyfriend. You should take her to the movies and then to a nice restaurant. That never fails! As long as you do it sincerely, Mario Hugo. Enough with your jokes! No! You have nowhere to run, Cachirula. That's what you think, wool-mouse! Sorry I'm late, I had to sew my head back on. You'll see, you fools! I'll be back soon with a new army because... I'm the great Cachirula- Stupid chair! Buddy! Buddy... Oh, Tulio, now we can go back to our TV show! Oh, of course, how could I forget! I'll stay! Yes! I'll live with the Huachimingos! A simple life away from my numberless debts. Because I'm now part of the tribe. - Right, Chief? - Almost, Bodoque. All that's left is to get your Huachimingo tattoos! Bring on the iron! Tattoos? Aren't your spots natural? Natural? Oh, mommy! Well, folks, this has been the happiest moment of our lives. Yay! But that moment has come to an end... Aww... We've made some great friends! Oooh! But now we must part... Aww... We must part, but to return to our dear homes! Yay! But first...music, please! Patana? Patana? Patana? Has anyone seen Patana? Patana? Oh, Patana? Patana? I wonder where Patana is.
