If Mom bought you a motorbike, it wasn't to go crazy. No need to laugh. Mom isn't happy. Sorry, Mom. Marie's waiting in your room. You should visit Cloclo in the hospital. He's not well. What a shame. It's nothing, darling. You'll be all right. Stop. Mom's here. That's good. That's all. Mother's here. Calm down. Get out, Marie. Mom's here. It'll be all right. Shit, this damn thing isn't even working. I can't ride this anymore. Tomorrow I'll take you on the back of mine. Yeah. What's worse, it's hot. - We're going out Friday? - Sure. About yesterday... Drop it. Think I like pissing in my pants? No. Think instead of Cloclo dying in the hospital. I hear he looks like a zombie. I think about you. How is he? How is he? Did you see his face? The whole gang's here. See the poster? It's about a guy who came back to life. Shut up. You still watching TV? What about your finch? Can it sing? Turn off the TV and show your finch to René. He's upset. He went to see Michou's brother. Cloclo, the one who's sick. - What's he got? - AIDS. AIDS? Is he a homosexual? Just like all of them on TV... That your finch? He's really beautiful. - What's his name? - Leo. - Does he sing? - No, not yet. - When will he? - In the spring. - Not the winter? - No, in the winter they're in cages. Time for your EEG. How beautiful. I can see your house. Stop it. There's nothing wrong with tenderness. Just kidding, Marie. What were you telling your mother about going to Lille? It'd be better. Bailleul or Lille, same thing. No, Bailleul's a hole. Same thing. No, you'll see. It's different. Sunday's Armistice Day. We're going to the cafe. Gege's dad is buying the drinks. Really? - November's hideous. - Yeah, always raining. And Sunday we're going to Dunkirk. Don't you think it's a bit early? No, Gégé's finished repairing his car and Michou's finished the army. Michou and Robert came to the supermarket. They sure pissed off my boss. He hates all teenagers. Do you love me, Fred? Sure, Hove you. Forever. In position. Music! Attention! They should pass by soon. When did you get back? -4:00. - At 4:00? - How are you, Yvette? - Thanks, Yvette. - Like our music? - Yes. - He really pounded the drum. - Like a hammer. Oh, my back is killing me. I don't want to. Fuck your mother, you dirty Arab. Shut up, towel heads. Gégé, put away my tools. You already told me. I know what's wrong. When you pull the choke it doesn't come back. In the morning when you pull the choke, it doesn't come right back. - There's no contact. - You don't know a thing. - Yes, it works. - Cut the shit. It's all the way up. The jerk startled me. I'm going to hook up the wire. That way it'll be done. - He's eating her tongue. - He never stops. - Here. - Thanks. Wait, we finished that. Yes, the carburetor. But next is the ignition. Right, the ignition. - The ignition's next. - Yeah. - Maybe check the carb again. - No, it's okay. Shit, the towel head. - What's he want? - I don't know. What the hell you doing here? You got a problem? What's with you? Come over here and I'll knock your head off. Fucking French sons of bitches! Get the fuck back here! Get the fuck back here! Son of a bitch. Next time I see him, I'll kill him. Go on, Michou. Come on, Robert. What bullshit. Hey, bitch, you take us for morons? - How about shutting up? - With all her crap? If you don't like it, go. You don't make me laugh. See you later. Bye, Freddy. My name's Kader. I'm sorry. We were just kidding. That all you going to buy? You nuts? Get out of here. - How are the lovebirds? - Fine. - How about a spin? - Great. - Where to? - The country? - No, downtown. - Yeah. - Downtown? - We'll have a ball. So we're going downtown? Shit, the car. Let's play chicken. I won, wow! - Chickenshits! - Shut up. Next time, hit it. - Good for nothing. - Shut up. Michou chickened out first. You almost got run over. You had lots of time. When I took off there wasn't a meter left and you continued. Shit, another fit. Let him breathe. - There's nothing around here. - Maybe we can phone from a farm. We're in real shit now. Maybe we should go to a farm and ask to phone. It's over for today, Freddy. You know that won't help things. You must be patient, like the doctor told you. Patient. I never know when it's going to hit. Think a little about Cloclo who's dead. At least you'd be humble. You should go see the race in person, not on TV. I'm not moving. I can watch it here. They'll fix the picture soon. It's just as good here. - Where's René? - He went to Cassel to see the runners. Where's Marie? She waited in your room. She left but is coming back. So, did you get laid? What would you know? - He got his hard-on loosened. - The old in-and-out? Let's go. I have to work. - Okay for Sunday? - Yeah, sure thing. Shit, does Freddy fuck. It's like that when you got a steady. I couldn't even fuck a chick. - Why not? - I'm in mourning. - You mean for your brother? - Yeah. That's how you feel about it? Yeah. Freddy and I decided on Sunday we're going to do something for you. Freddy thinks of everything. He thinks of everything. How you doing, Michou? You really serious? You're done with chicks? Gégé, my brother's gone. I feel like shit. - What do you feel? - I don't know. I don't feel so good. - You'll get over it. - It's tough. I'm all alone. You still got your pals. What are we going to do? Shit, I'm hot. Wish we could go to the beach and get drunk as hell. Thursday we're racing that asshole with his GTI. You staying longer this time? Michou, he's going to leave last. He's going to rub fenders with the GTI. My cousin told me the guy's from Merville. He's a rally driver. No surprise, the way he drives. We never see his face. What a great song. Nowheresville! You going home? Why don't you talk to me? You don't like Arabs? You're wasting your time. You don't stand a chance. That's your head speaking, not your eyes. Yeah, sure. Have you finished or what? I'm almost home. You think I want to be seen with you? Don't be angry. Get lost. I mean it. - Go see her, Freddy. - Get lost. - So? - He refuses to listen. Why'd you tell him all that? Go back and see him. He won't love me anymore. Go back. - Nothing happened. - Mind your own business. Game over. I won. I'm sorry. But when I heard about the Arab, I could have killed you. I didn't do anything. He tried to pick you up? But that's all. He just followed me. Don't do it again. Stop. Nothing happened. I love you. You're my whole life But I love you so much I cry all the time I can't talk, I can't sleep I want to make love to you To make you sing I want to make you love me We'll go dancing You're my love When you're around, loan'! eat You're nuts driving at that speed without a license. What were we doing? 70, 80. You can tack on ten easy. - Okay, we splitting? - Yeah, let's split. The trip to the beach is for you. In memory of your brother. Thanks, Freddy. He's in heaven now. It's not easy talking about death... and everything. This is the time you come home? There was a big traffic jam. Lots of traffic. Sure, sure. How's unemployment? No one works on Sundays. For you it's Sunday every day. You're some pair. We had a good laugh. Yes, a good one on me. Okay, I'm going. Were you driving? Yes. The others don't have a license, and Freddy's sick. Yes, I know. Don't worry. You and Freddy can joke, but it'll end up badly. Now go watch your film. They always start late, so... What's on TV tonight? I don't remember. I'll check. - Don't hang around. - I'm not leaving like that. Don't make fun of my mother. We going to fix that Arab soon? - You let an Arab screw your girl? - Shut up. - Just kidding. - If it happened to you, it'd be the same. I was kidding. That towel heads's going to get his. - What's your mother doing? - Drop it and go. Bye, Freddy. When are you going to find a job? Stop bugging me. Jobs don't just fall from the sky. I look, but there's nothing. Stop ordering me around. If I don't who Will? You're just like Dad. If he could only see you now... Bullshit. - Don't talk like that. - Anyhow, I get welfare. So knock it off. But you won't get it forever. I'm going out. See you later. Hi. - How'd it go? - Fine. - We went to Dunkirk. - Really? Gégé even lent me his car. We went real fast. - We did something for Michou too. - Really? That's nice. My mom's driving me nuts. Stop it. Your mom's great. - You stink of sweat. - Cut it out. Can you be stupid. I want to make love. And I want to go home. I'm tired. My dad's going to yell. - You hurt me last time. - What do you mean? You hurt me. Don't you understand? Now I have a hard-on. You're a real shit. - I was just kidding. - I hope so. His fries are pure grease. Go tell him. I sure as hell will. I can't eat that. These aren't fries. They're 100 percent grease. Just like the finger up your ass! - You hear that jerk? - Yeah. He ought to be ashamed. A real moron. - How's it going? - Hi. Dig the shoes. Got your welfare check, I see. Shit, the Arab. Bet you they're in the cemetery. I'll go see. Shit, the caretaker. Come on. Let's split. I'll get the bastard one day. It's as hot as hell. Damned bird shit! It's a real pigsty here. Shit, an 1100 Laverda. - When's the rehearsal? - Half past 5:00. It's already a quarter to 3:00. What heat. This sucks. I'm taking off. How about a spin? We're done, girls. - Shit, was I hot. - Stop bragging. Stop? I was too hot to be true. Next week we'll try again for those not up to it, okay? Move it. What's all this shit? Move it. I'm in a hurry. Shit, fatso's there. What the hell you doing here? Got kicked out? Out of the way, asshole. Pull down her panties. Freddy, put your hand on her ass. You bitch! You disgust me! You belong in jail! I don't want your money! Bunch of bastards! You raped her! Dishonored her! - Raped? - Yes, raped! Get out! Get the hell out! Get out of my sight! Bunch of hoodlums! Get the hell out! Get out! Her old man wasn't kidding. No need to blow a fuse for that. As if we actually raped the fat slob. And she had to blab about it. She should really thank us. You see our folks' expressions? - My mom's going to scream. - He wanted to call the cops. Call the cops for that. What a joke. The fat bitch turns my stomach. Stop. I'm in no mood. "Stop. I'm in no mood." - Stop. - "Stop." I'm sorry, Marie. You aren't always funny. I only have an hour. I have to go eat. - Wait. - No, stop. - What's wrong? - Nothing. - Come on. What's wrong? - Nothing. What's the matter? I'm tired. That's all. I need rest. What's really wrong? What happened with the majorette? - How did you know? - We live on the same street. You're all a bunch of jerks. We were just having fun. You call that fun? You don't get enough with me? It's not the point. I don't want a guy they say's a bastard. Stop it. My body isn't enough? - Stop. - You crazy? You okay, Freddy? Fine, I'm sleeping. You know you're grounded today. Yeah, I know. Mom's ashamed of you. I mean ashamed. You can't imagine. What about Marie? You think about her? In this heat you have to bathe every hour. Tomorrow, same thing, a heat wave. That guy's a clown. Who's the guy? Some guy who shows off his car. And the others play along with him. How are you? You're asking for it. I know some guys who'd like to kill you. Don't worry. I'm used to it. You're talking to me? I'm not. You're just following me home. Through the park? Your name's Marie? That's pretty. Mine's Kader. A real Arab name. - Can I see you again? - Never. You see me now and that's it. Is this what you want? You out of your mind? You watch TV late last night again? The doctor said it's not good for you and your epilepsy. Remember your appointment at the hospital? Yeah. - You fought with Marie again. - That's my business. What are you going to do about the girl? You have to pay them. You can get a job picking potatoes. Well, if that's the only way. That's good. You're not so bad after all. Look, there's René. The early bird. Hi, everyone. Hi, Freddy. What's happening? A glass of white wine and hurry. I'm in a rush. - In a rush? - Yes. - Where to? - Lille. - How you going? - By train. - When are you back? - This afternoon. - Who you going to see? - My boss. Pretty unusual for you. - Not at all. - Sure it is. - See you later, beautiful. - See you. What a flatterer. Makes you laugh, huh? Well, back to work. I scared you? You're pretty forward. I was surprised. You don't want me? You never stop, do you? Usually it's not so fast. What's it like usually? I don't know. The guy runs after the girl. It doesn't matter to me. What are you looking at? You think he's coming? No. - You drop your boyfriend? - I don't have one. - It stinks of piss here. - It sure does. Forgive me. - What happened? - We had a breakdown. Park the bikes and let's go. Hurry UP- - What are you doing? - Go to hell. Go fuck yourself. Go get fucked. Put him on the back. Freddy, he's had enough. Shut up. Get into the car. Hurry the hell up. Hand me your keys. We'll dump him further along. He died during the night. You don't like Arabs? Are you a racist? Beating up a young guy like that. Are you the only one responsible for this?
