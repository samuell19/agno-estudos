[WHOOPING SOFTLY] JFK, please, as quick as you can. [WHOOPING] [SCREAMING] [ALL EXCLAIMING] Oh, my God! Oh, my God! [ALL LAUGHING] I missed you. Oh, no... We’re... We’re... ALL: Sophie, Ali, Lisa! We’re the greatest, greatest mates! - I’m tough. - I’m tall. - I’m tiny. - ALL: And we’re gonna rock this place. - Sophie, it’s beautiful. - I want one. He did well, didn’t he? I’m getting married tomorrow. I’m so glad you’re here, because I have a secret and I can’t tell anybody else. Sophie, you’re knocked up? No! No! No! I’ve invited my dad to my wedding. You are joking! You found him at last? No! No, no, no, no, no, not exactly. Okay. You know what my mom always said - when I asked about my father. - Mmm-hmm. It was a summer romance, and he’d gone long before she realized that she was expecting me. And I’d always kind of accepted that that’s all I’d ever know. Well, I was ransacking some old trunks and I found this. It’s the diary she kept the year she was pregnant with me. Sophie! “July 17th. What a night!” I don’t know if I want to hear this! I do! “Sam rowed me over to the little island.” That’s here. That’s Kalokairi. “We danced on the beach, and we kissed on the beach, “and dot, dot, dot.” What? “Dot, dot, dot.” That’s what they did in the olden days. Stop it! “Sam’s the one. I know he is. “I’ve never felt like this before.” [“HONEY HONEY” PLAYING] [SINGING] ♪ Honey, honey ♪ How he thrills me Honey, honey ♪ ♪ Honey, honey ♪ ♪ Nearly kills me Honey, honey ♪ ♪ I’ve heard about him before ♪ ♪ I wanted to know some more ♪ ♪ And now I know what they mean ♪ ♪ He’s a love machine ♪ ♪ Oh, he makes me dizzy ♪ ♪ Honey, honey Let me feel it ♪ ♪ Honey, honey ♪ ♪ Honey, honey Don’t conceal it ♪ ♪ Honey, honey ♪ ♪ The way that you kiss good night ♪ ♪ The way that you kiss me good night ♪ ♪ The way that you hold me tight ♪ ♪ The way that you’re holding me tight ♪ ♪ I feel like I wanna sing ♪ ♪ When you do your thing ♪ So this guy Sam’s your father!

What a night! “Bill rented a motorboat, and I took him over to the little island.” Bill? Sophie, wait. Hang on. “Though I’m still obsessed with Sam, “Bill’s so wild. He’s such a funny guy. “One thing led to another, “August 11th. Harry turned up, out of the blue, “so I said I’d show him the island. “He’s so sweet and understanding, I couldn’t help it and ALL: Dot, dot, dot! - Oh, my God! - [SINGSONGING] Here come the bridesmaids. Donna! Look at you! God! Stop growing! You sound like you’re having fun already. Oh, we are. I used to have fun. Oh, we know!

My sentiments exactly. So, who is your dad? - Sam, Bill or Harry? - I don’t know. But which one did you invite? BOTH: Oh, my God! Do they know? What would you write to a total stranger? “Please come to my wedding, you might be my father”? No. They think that Mom sent the invites, and with what’s in here, no surprise they said yes!

You guys need a ride to Kalokairi? Excuse me, coming through. I have a senior citizen with me. Thank you. My mother needs a perch. Mother? We’re the same age. Yeah. Well, parts of us are. [GRUNTS] Ooh! Sailor. Um, no. Oh! [THANKS IN GREEK] [SIGHS] TANYA: Oh, he has your book! [CHUCKLING] on... Stavros, Stavros. Stavros. [SCREAMING] It’s just a fish. You are so clever. We’re going to look fabulous tomorrow. I want the perfect wedding, and I want my father to give me away. Better be a wide aisle. - Ow! - I will know my father as soon as I see him. LISA: Sky! Come here, gorgeous. SKY: Put me down. I’m getting married tomorrow. Please be careful. - So? - There are pins in the dresses. What do you think? Oh, yes! “Oh, yes.” If you had your way, it’d be a three-minute wedding in jeans and T-shirts, washed down with a bottle of beer. You make me sound so unromantic! I just thought we should save our money for traveling. Well, we’re not going anywhere yet. Anyway, please leave. We’re very, very busy. I’m just getting some props for tonight. LISA AND ALI: Ooh! SOPHIE: For his bachelor party. Why haven’t you told him you’ve invited your dads? Because he would say that I’d have to tell my mom. Donna’s absolutely gonna kill you when she finds out. By the time she finds out, it’ll be too late. I feel like there’s a part of me missing, and when I meet my dad, everything will fall into place. [BILL EXCLAIMS] - BILL: More open! - HARRY: I’m on it. I’m on it. That’s good. That’s it. Come on, Cleopatra. [SHRIEKS] My Shoe! Will you look at what the tide washed in? For one night. And one night only. ALL: Donna and the Dynamos! [ALL SCREAMING] Look at you! You baby! Look at you! You look fantastic! You look like an old hippie! She looks fab. These are new, though. Where did you get these? Husband number three! ALL: Dynamos! Dynamite! ALL: Sleep all day and... [WHOOP] All night! [ALL LAUGHING] TANYA: So, any men at this wedding? Gorgeous Greeks of independent means? Here we go! Husband number four! - No! Not for me, for her! - He’s coming! For her, now that her book is a bestseller, and she’s got the whole world stuffing, what, mushrooms? Various vegetables? It’s time to find Mr. Right! Oh, please. Boring! Great couple of role models you two are for Sophie! A serial bride and a little hermit over here! That’s me! I’m a lone wolf! [HOWLING] ROSIE: So, when are the lovebirds flying the nest? Oh, God! Who knows? You know, I do not know what is going on in that child’s head sometimes. She wants a big white wedding, and she and Sky are making all kinds of plans for the hotel. Sometimes I think they’ll never leave. Yeah, but do you really want her to? Well, I want what’s best for her. Of course not! [ALL LAUGHING] Sky! Come meet my backup girls. - ROSIE: Backup girls, my ass! - TANYA: Backup girls, my ass! He’s the leading man at tomorrow’s shindig. - SKY: The lucky man. - Hello. You must be Rosie. I am. - How are you? - Very well. Oh! And you must be Tanya. I’ve heard so much about you. All bad, I hope. - Yes. - And all true. Donna... Here, let me get them. I know who you are. You’re Bill Anderson, aren’t you? Uh-huh. Bloke in a Boat in Botswana. Yes, I am. You know, your books are a godsend on dull business trips. Now, I may look like I’m pondering my securities, but in reality, I’m trekking across some remote corner of the planet. You should try it for real sometime. No, certainly, I’ll never be the spontaneous adventurer. You’re a close friend of Donna’s? No, I haven’t heard from her for 20 years. - SAM: Really? - And then this invite, out of the blue. You know, that’s a coincidence, neither had I. Going about! You got it! Right. Wait... I’ve got it. Fine. Fine. ROSIE: You should have brought the iron lung. Why did I wear stilettos? - [GASPING] Oxygen - Oh, my God! Auntie Rosie! Hey, hey! Look at Sophie. She’s gotten so beautiful! I know. Come here to me. Oh! Sophie Sheridan, you get more gorgeous every time I see you. You do. I bet you don’t remember me. Not with all that plastic surgery. Of course I do, Auntie Tanya. You haven’t changed at all. - I’m so happy for you. - Look at my baby, her whole life ahead of her. Oh, please, I’m getting married. I’m not joining a convent! - Ooh! She’s feisty. I love that. - Yeah. She’s a chip off the old block. If she were more like me, she wouldn’t be getting married at 20. Or married at all. Oh, I meant to get the laundry down before you came. ROSIE: Tanya’s going home! And you’d think with all this new technology, they would figure out a machine that would make the beds. And if they did, you’d be going along behind it, making them again. I know you, Mom. But I am good at modern... Tell them about the Internets. - He’s gonna put me on the line. - SOPHIE: Online. SKY: I’m designing a website. I just think this place has so much potential, and no one knows we’re here. So, if I market it really, really well, then, hopefully, people will come flooding in. We just want this to be the ultimate romantic destination. This was once supposed to be the site of Aphrodite’s fountain, you know, the goddess of love. And if you drank the water, you were supposed to find true love and perfect happiness. I’ll have a glass of that. Yeah, I’ll have a bucket. TANYA: Aphrodite’s spa? Well, I thought you didn’t want boatloads of tourists. Oh, no, not boatloads, no. But, you know, a few more would be nice. Okay, now, the thing about the toilet, if it doesn’t flush right away, just go and come back in a while, and it should... Nothing works around here, except for me. I’ve been running this hotel for 15 years, and I have never had a day off. [EXCLAIMING] Oh, my God! Sorry.

Does she wear it or floss with it? TANYA: Floss you. Is it edible, Tanya? “The world’s most luxurious moisturizer “contains flakes of 24-karat gold “and extracts of donkey testicle.” You’re just jealous. At a thousand dollars a dollop. Tell you, that’s the price you have to pay if you wanna drink before 11:00 in the morning. - And we do. - We do. Hi. May I help you? BILL: Sure, we’re here for the wedding. - I’m Bill Anderson. - SOPHIE: Huh? I’m Bright, Harry Bright. Sam Carmichael. You are expecting us? Oh, my God. Yes! You’re not Donna’s daughter? I thought you looked familiar Uh, Sofia. - It’s Sophie. - Well, Sofia is the Greek. Well, I’m named after a Sofia. I used to have a great-aunt living on the mainland named Sofia. Would you mind if we see our rooms before we see your mother? Sure. It’s just that I’d quite like to freshen up before the big reunion. No! No! I mean, yes, but come this way. [CHUCKLING] Come on! Oh, my God! I got a crack in my courtyard. I gotta go fix it. - Hey, listen, Donna? Donna. - I’m serious. Move. Whoa! Sit down! - She won’t let me go! - I know... I know you’re going to make a fortune with web’s... “With web’s...” With Sky’s site. I know you’re gonna make a fortune with Sky’s website, but... It’s good. Are you gonna be okay until then? I think Tanya is offering to pawn her bling. - No, seriously, Donna... - Oh, my God. Do you need a loan? No, sweet. Oh, God, I’m just whining, you know me. I don’t need to be taken care of. Yeah, but are you being taken care of? What do you mean? Are you getting any? Oh, you mean... [DRILL WHIRRING] Down, boy, down, boy. No, it takes too much energy. Yeah. Just more plumbing to be maintained, isn’t it? Yeah. Oh, God, I’m so glad that whole part of my life is over. You know, seriously. [EXHALES] I do not miss it at all. [CLEARS THROAT] [GOAT BLEATING] Then it’s just right here. Good. Where’s Donna? Hey! Okay. Up you go. [CHUCKLES] [GROANS SOFTLY] Hmm. You know, I don’t want to seem ungrateful for the scenic tour, but might I be shown my room now? Well, don’t hold your breath, Harry, but I think this is your room. Can we see Donna now? I sent the invites. My mom doesn’t know anything. [SIGHING] [GIGGLING] Well, she’s done so much for me, and she’s always talking about you guys and the good old days, and I thought, what an amazing surprise for her that you are all gonna be at my wedding. Hang on, Sophie. I can’t be here. The last time I saw your mother, she said she never wanted to see me again. That was years ago. Please, it would mean a lot to me. Why? HARRY: Listen, I can see that you’ve been to a great deal of trouble. Might I suggest that we all reconvene on your boat? - Good idea. - Nope. - Why? - It’s an adventure, Harry. It’s good for you. Oh, I see. Okay, when I sent the invites, it was a long shot that you’d even reply. And now you’ve come all this way for a wedding. Surely there must have been some special reason for you to be here. Like some siren call, maybe? [ALL CHUCKLING] You’re a little minx, you know that? You’re just like your mother. I’m glad my boys haven’t met you. They’d never recover. You have sons? Yes, two. And someday, I’d like to bring them here. Like you used to bring my mother? [DONNA HUMMING] - No. - It’s Donna. [WHISPERING] No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Listen, listen, she can’t know. I’m going to go. Please stay. Promise me that you’ll not tell anybody that I invited you. Okay? Promise? You got it, baby. It’s a promise. - I might regret it, but okay. - Okay. There wouldn’t, uh, by any chance, happen to be a trouser press on the island, would there? DONNA: Harry? [GASPS] Bill?

Okay, good, but who... Why are you here? Who said that you could stay up in my old goat-house? - BILL: Didn’t catch the name. - Greek lady. - Well, she spoke Greek. - Yeah. Or maybe she said we couldn’t stay in the old goat-house. - Yeah, maybe that was it, in Greek. - There you go. Yeah, that’s it, that’s it. You can’t stay here because I’m, uh, closed and I’m full.

Donna, Donna, they didn’t know she existed. Well, they didn’t need to know, did they? I’ve done a great job with Soph, all by myself, and I won’t be muscled out by an ejaculation! [“GIMME! GIMME!

What am I doing here? DONNA: Some air in here. [SIGHING] Somebody up there has got it in for me. I bet it’s my mother. TANYA: Oh, and wasn’t she a ray of sunshine. I’m gonna go get them out of here.

No, that’s all right, I can deal my own disasters. Why didn’t you tell me it was Sophie getting married? Well, I didn’t think it was any of your business. Why is she getting married? Settling down on the island? I mean, if it was up to me, I’d be telling her to go get a life. - Yeah. - She’s a bright kid. I know. I know. But, you know, my daughter has a mind of her own. Oh, yeah. I see that. I see that. - But she’s so young. - I know. I mean, does she know what she really wants? You see, I think part of her just wants to let you know that she isn’t going to leave you alone here, on your own. Mmm-hmm. - What do you mean? - Donna, look. I have two grown children. I know something about letting go. - Oh. - If Sophie felt you were okay on your own, would she want something different for herself? Okay, here’s the thing. I love being on my own. I really do.

No, I thought you would try to stop me. - I know I messed up. - Sophie? Is that what this whole big white wedding is about? - You finding your dad? - No. No! I wanted to take a boat to the mainland with a couple of witnesses. And you insisted on this sodding circus so you could play Happy Families. It’s about knowing who I am.

But I told Lorraine I couldn’t marry her, and I came right back. You... You... [BREATHES DEEPLY] Why didn’t you call me? Because I was crazy enough to think that you would be waiting for me.

It’s all right. You don’t have to. No, no, I just wanted to say it’s great to have even a third of Sophie. I never thought I’d get even that much of a child. Donna, you were the first girl I ever loved. Well, actually, you were the last girl I ever loved. Now, this gives me an excuse to come here much more often. We can find out if you want, but I’m with Harry. Being a third of your dad is great by me. BILL: By me, too. I’ll take a third. Typical, isn’t it? You wait 20 years for a dad, and then three come along at once. Dearly beloved... You know, I have no clue which one of you is my dad, but I don’t mind. Now, I know what I really want.
