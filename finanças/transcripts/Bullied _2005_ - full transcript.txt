Dear Mr Spadaccini, The Tri-State Film Society is pleased to inform you that your short film entitled Unstable, Unstable, the DVD cover art for it, has won the 2004 Tri-State Film Festival. As a result of your first place showing, we're honored to provide with a $35 thousand scholarship towards the film school of your choice. That's very exciting. So, this weekend, me and several of my closest friends are going camping to celebrate 'cause I haven't been camping in years and they all promised me that if I did win, they'd take me camping, so that's what we're doing. (jars clink) This is Mr Jim Schaffer, going through my shit. What's up, Jim? - Hey. - What ya eatin'? - [Jim] Hot dogs. - Awesome. You ready to go camping? - Eh, yeah. Where's your knives? - Right in there, I think. There was some up there too. (Jim sighs) Let's just hope we don't get shot. - Does this go up or down? What is this thing? - I think it's just to open it, I'm not sure. (doorbell rings) (dog barks) Oh, someone's here. And who's the first camper to arrive at our little humble abode? Bobby, how are you? - Good, how are you? - Pretty good. - That's good. - Put your stuff down. Jim, your shit's in the car, right? - Yeah. - Bobby, you know Jim, Jim? - What the fuck's he doing here? - What? - What the fuck's he doing here? - I invited him. - Why? - Because he's my friend. He wanted to go. Come on, what's wrong? - Nothing. - What's wrong? - Where's your plates? There we go. - Jim? - Hmm? - Jim, seriously, what's wrong? - Nothing. - No, what's wrong? - I don't want him going. - Why? - Because I don't like him. He's a faggot. - Knock it off. - Whatever. - I'm trying to think if I might want something to eat. Jim? - What? - What's your deal? - Nothing. I already told you. Just drop it. - Jim, what's your deal? - Nothing. You know I don't like him, I don't like goddamn faggots. I don't know why he's coming along. I don't wanna hear it, you know what, I should probably just take my shit and go home. - Jim. You already promised me that if I won the film festival then you'd take me camping. I won the film festival, so you hold up your end up the deal. Alright, I want him going. Alright, he's not hurting anybody. - Fine. - You don't have to be friends but at least get along. - I didn't say I wouldn't. - Whatever, alright, fine. - Aw, fuck. (laughing) Aw, shit. - Nice going. - It's on my fat stomach. Pop the trunk. - Alright. Mr. Horace. Are we tired? - I ran around all day. What's all this mess? - Alright, this is it. We'll be filming each and every moment almost. - Okay. - Okay, alright. - Okay. - Can I go around the side? - Yeah, sure. - Okay. - Can we fit all this? - I hope so. - We'll throw that back there (laughs). - Ah, the important stuff. - Yeah, booze.

(laughing) - For me anyway. - And this. And this and that. - [Jim] I don't want him here. - Unbelievable, you know that? - [Jim] I'm allowed my opinion. - Yeah, I know. Are you gonna be okay? (inaudible chattering) (loud whirring) Just cut the shit. - [Jim] No. - Unbelievable. - [Jim] If you don't like it, I'll go home. - This is my weekend, so, no. - You ready? - Yeah, we're ready. - Alright. - [Anthony] Wade, you know Bobby. - Yes. Oh, God, I start falling asleep, so. - [Anthony] I think we're all gonna be. It's gonna be an early night tonight... - Okay. - Because we'll pick up Chris early tomorrow. I gotta go to my grandparents to get the coolers and then we'll be on our way. There's, all the sodas that are in the bags. (car ignition rumbles) - He's got keys to your car? - Yeah. (car door thuds) - We're taking all this shit 'cause Jim lives down near where we're camping at, so we're just giving all the food to him, so we have more room. Now Steve, you've met Bobby before, right? - No, never. Bobby, I'm Steve, hi. - [Jim] Anthony (chattering inaudibly) (inaudible chatter) (loud engines running) - He's my buddy. - We go way back. - Yeah, way back. - Way back to what? - Couple months ago.

I was gonna fold my seat down which has a lot more room. It's good to, we can take five people and everything, so. The only other thing we can do is put these up top. - [Anthony] That's what you were sayin' before. - Yeah, do you have boots? - [Bobby] I'm gonna turn off the camera. - Alright. - What? - We packed my sodas. - Well I didn't pack them. - Someone packed them so now I have to. - [Anthony] Oh yeah, the root beer ones.

He's out there fuckin' wanderin' around. Let's get a tarp, we'll cover him up. We can't touch it 'cause you know the police are gonna investigate. - Yeah but even putting a tarp on it, isn't that gonna like destroy evidence or something? - No, that'll cover.

(sighs) - [Jim] I don't care what they think. I didn't do it, you know I didn't do it. You've known me way too long that I would not do somethin' like that. - [Anthony] Jim, I don't even. - [Jim] I know you don't know what to think right now. - [Anthony] I don't know what to think, honestly. - [Jim] And if I was in your shoes, I wouldn't either. - I mean. - I don't like the kid. I despise him but I never wish him dead. I know what it looks like. - [Anthony] What are we gonna tell the police? - [Jim] Tell 'em what you saw, tell 'em what you found. - [Anthony] Well I've got enough on video tape for that. - [Jim] I didn't kill him, you don't have anything on video tape that says that I do, that I did. - [Anthony] That doesn't make a difference, Jim. It looks suspicious. - I know what it looks. - The whole. - I know what the fuck it looks like. - The whole time he's been here, the whole time we've been here. You've been. You've been treatin' him like shit. And he didn't do a damn thing to you. And now he's dead. I mean, what am I supposed to think? What are they supposed to think? - [Jim] Fuck it, y'all can think what you want. You're going to anyway. - [Anthony] Well I will back you up. You know where my loyalty lies. - [Jim] How the fuck are you gonna back me up? You think what they think. - [Anthony] You want me to just blindly trust you? - [Jim] I'm not asking you to trust me. You just, you know me. - I've known you for 10 years. - [Jim] If you think I'm capable of something like this, then maybe I am but I didn't do it. - [Anthony] I didn't say, Jim, this is not you. This whole weekend has not been you. I've never seen you in my life treat anybody like that, especially somebody you don't even know. Is it because he's gay? - Yes, it's because he's gay. - [Anthony] You've had gay friends before. Whatever, I'm on your side, okay. - [Jim] How are you gonna be on my side? You think what they think. - Yeah, okay. I'm loyal to you. - [Eric] Look, I don't know what the fuck's goin' on. We need to resolve somethin' 'cause them guys are gettin' crazy over there. We need to go back and resolve somethin'. - Alright. - They wanna tear me apart. - [Anthony] Wade wants to tear you apart. We can control Wade, Steve's twice Wade's size. - [Eric] We can control Wade, let's at least resolve, get some sort of. - Control. - Yeah, somethin'. - How are we gonna control, they're never gonna believe me. They're all convinced. Well Wade anyway, I don't know what Chris and Steve think. - [Eric] I don't know what to think either. But I'm just ya know. - There's nothing we can do till morning, okay. - We've gotta move out first thing in the mornin' and yeah. - [Anthony] At least an area where we have cell phone signal. - [Eric] Get the authorities in here and let them do their investigation. See what they can find. - If you didn't do it, okay. - I didn't do it. - [Anthony] Okay, alright. If that's the case. - It's not if. That's the fuckin' truth. - They're gonna know. Okay? You've seen CSI and the forensics shit they do nowadays. They'll know. And then they'll believe you and I'll believe you. Let's just go, come on, let's go back. - Come on man, let's go. - We have to resolve this. Jim. - Come on Jim. - [Anthony] Come on. (sighs) - [Eric] Stay out here, it's just gonna make it worse. - [Anthony] Are you serious, we cannot even like get near to an area where there's a signal or anything? - [Eric] Dude, we're at least 15, 20 miles from the nearest, I think there's a ranger station up on the other side of the mountain but I'm not sure. - [Anthony] Well okay why can't we drive? - [Eric] Dude, you'll never get up that hill. You'll never get on the other side of that mountain. - [Anthony] We got down here, didn't we? - [Eric] They're all horseback trails. We came in from the other side. - Why can't we go that way? - There's nothin' goin' back that side, we go back the way we came in, shit. We're lookin' at probably, hell, probably, damn near 50 miles. - So is that why you guys came in here before dark? - Yeah. - Jim, you still there? Still with us? Alright, let's try to, Wade's gonna fuckin'. - [Eric] We'll need somethin' to eat, just sit down, relax. - I need a fuckin' drink. - That too. - Let me get, uh. Find a signal, call the police. But there's absolutely nothing we can do at this point in time. - Yeah, there's somethin' I can do. I can beat his fuckin' ass. - Shut up. - [Anthony] Wade, shut up. - Wade, come on, calm down. - What are we talkin' about? He killed somebody. - We don't know that. We don't know that. - So just calm down. - He was the only one fuckin'. - Yeah you already said that. - Were you there? - Stop it. - Bullshit. - You have no fucking proof. - Fuck you. - [Anthony] Wade, if you really believe that he had anything to do with it, why are you letting him sit over here? - I know I've been an asshole to him all weekend. - [Wade] Because if I fuckin' kill him right now, I'm no better than what he is. - But I did not kill him. - Fuck you. - Think what you want. - I think what I know. - You don't know shit. - [Anthony] Guys, come on. - None of you know shit. - How you tell me to fuckin' calm down, I gotta sleep with this mother fucker in the same fuckin' area, he fuckin' killed somebody. - [Anthony] Wade, we don't know if he killed Bobby. - I know I didn't do it, I know he didn't do it. He was the only one missing. - [Anthony] Bobby was gone for a long time. Anything could've happened, it doesn't mean. - Oh I'm sorry, I was the only callin' Bobby a fag the whole time, I was the one tormenting Bobby. No I wasn't, it was that mother fucker. God, man, how can you fuckin' live with yourself, asshole? - [Anthony] What else do you want me to say? - Get him outta here, fuck that shit. - [Anthony] I'm not gonna get him outta here. I'm not gonna tell him to leave. - He's fine, he's not sleeping with you tonight, okay. - Doesn't matter, I don't wanna fuckin' here it okay, fuck that shit. Don't go to sleep tonight, bitch. - Tell you what, why don't we just, let's just all stay up tonight. - [Anthony] Well I know I'm not gonna be able to sleep. - Yeah, I'm not going to sleep. - So let's just stay up. - Let's talk and have nice conversation. - Just calm down. - Let's have a good old fashioned (mumbles). - [Anthony] I'm at a loss for words, guys. I have no idea, this is like, this is fuckin' unreal. - If I was your fuckin' friend, you tell me to calm the fuck down, I don't even know the mother fucker. I'm still upset, fuck you. - [Anthony] Wade, knock it off. - [Wade] You just made a fuckin' mistake, bitch. Big fuckin' mistake. - Anthony, we gotta do somethin'. - What are we gonna do? - [Steve] I don't know but we. - [Anthony] What? What do we do? - Fuckin'! - Wade, Wade, yo, stop it! Knock it off. - Fuckin' leave. - I didn't fuckin' do it. - Leave right now. - Just stay over here. - Leave the fuck right now. - [Jim] Where the fuck do you want me to go? - Leave, I don't give a fuck. - Come on. - Wade, there's nowhere he can go. - Fuckin' leave. - We're in the middle of nowhere. - Right now. - There's nowhere to go. - Fuck that shit. - There's nowhere to go. Nowhere to go. - We can't let him go. He's got nowhere to go, we got nowhere to go. - Fuck that man. If you wanna fuckin' live, you better fuckin' leave right now, fuck that shit. You're not sleepin' here. - Stay away from each other. - [Wade] Fuck that shit, he's fuckin' tormenting some kid all fuckin' weekend. I don't know how you're so fuckin' calm. He's your fuckin' friend, fuck that shit, man. Get him outta here, fuck that shit, leave. - Knock it off. - Oh, I'm supposed to knock it off. - Yeah. I asked you to fuckin' knock it off. I'm gonna ask you again, knock it the fuck off. - What's he gonna do? What are you gonna do? - [Anthony] I'm not gonna do a damn thing. - You gonna kill me too, oh shit, I wish he would try. Fuck that shit. I'm the only one that's fuckin' rational around here. You guys, oh let's calm down, let's calm down. He fuckin' killed somebody. - [Anthony] We also are out like in the middle of nowhere. - Okay, we leave now, we could be somewhere in at least an hour. - Eric, Eric. Explain it to him. - Alright look. We can't go back the same way we came. We're at least an hour, hour and a half goin' back the other way, there's a couple horse trails on the other side of the mountain, we can hike out in the morning, we can be there in probably. - We have cars, why can't we go the way we came? - [Anthony] We can go in the morning. We can't go tonight. - Take twice as long. There's a ranger station right on the other side of the mountain, it'll be closer. Either way you look at it, we're still at least probably two hours out. - What time is it now? - Any kind of communication. - It's after midnight. - We're not gonna sleep tonight anyway. - No, but look. Why don't you move your tent? - I know I'm not. - Why don't you move your tent next to mine, I'm gonna be up all night. Just keep an eye on and I'll keep Wade off your back. - [Anthony] You can even sleep in my tent. - [Eric] We'll make it through tonight. And we'll move out at first light. And we'll get some help. - Jesus fucking Christ. - Nothin' we can do, man. - How you figure you're the only one pissed off? (inaudible chattering) You wanna go to jail for the rest of your life too. - I didn't do shit. - You're trying to. I'm trying to keep you from going to jail. - I'll beat his ass, fuck that. - Look, we can't disturb the crime scene. If we do, we're all in jeopardy. - [Wade] I know one thing, that mother fucker killed him. What the fuck are you doin' back? - Wade knock it off. - No, you're gonna tell me. - I said knock it off. - Yo man, I didn't fuckin' invite a killer up here, fuck that shit. - I didn't invite a killer either. - Oh yeah but he's gonna fuckin' kill somebody. - Come on, what the fuck you want? - Fuck you man. - Guys, guys. - [Steve] Come on guys, what are you doing? Come on guys, come on, what the hell are you guys doin'? - [Wade] Man, this is bullshit man, fuck that shit. - I didn't invite a killer, okay. - [Wade] Tell somebody else, asshole. - [Amy] Guys, calm down, just a little bit. (sobs) - [Anthony] What am I gonna tell his mom? - [Jim] Tell her you don't know what happened. - But Jim, I think you did it, okay. I think you fuckin' did it. - I know you think I did it. I know you think I did it. And if I was in your boots, I would too. I'm just asking you to trust me, I didn't do it. - Hey, you alright? - What time is it? (mumbles) We're not gettin' any sleep. - Do you need anything? - No. I've had enough. Turn that off. Please. Steve, shut it off please. Nevermind. (inaudible chatter) - [Wade] Where the fuck is he going? - [Anthony] I have no idea. - Fuck that shit. - Wade. - Just let him go. - He needs to stop drinking. - [Wade] You make me stop drinkin', I swear somethin's gonna happen. - [Anthony] I am fuckin' exhausted. (sighs) What time is it, 4:37. I haven't pulled an all nighter in like two years. - All nighter, how can you even fuckin' compare it, man? Somebody fucking dead over there. - His name was Bobby, alright. You keep talkin' about him like he was a nobody. His name was Bobby, call him by his name. - [Wade] At least I'm recognizing the fact that Bobby is dead over there. The rest of you are like oh, let's calm the fuck down. - [Man] 'Cause freaking out about it isn't gonna do anything. - [Wade] And you want me to do what? - Do nothing, you're not a cop, just let it go. Just let it go, are you a cop, no, just let it go. It's not your job. - Doin' nothin'. That's why he's over there now. We did nothin' all fuckin' weekend. - [Man] Somebody did something where something happened, okay, doing nothing isn't going to affect it. - We weren't there, we don't know what happened. - So let it go. - I know what fuckin' happened. - Yeah. But you're the bigger person. - I am the bigger person. I'm gonna fuckin' beat his ass too. - [Steve] Yeah, that really makes you the bigger person. - [Anthony] So you're bigger than Jim because. - At least I'm doin' somethin' than sittin' there goin' let's not do. - Well apparently Jim did something too. He didn't like somebody so he just offed 'em. - You can't compare me to him, man. - We don't know that Jim killed him. - [Wade] All I know is that we're all fuckin' eatin', havin' a good time, one goes one way. - This is a good time? - We're all comin'. - Yeah this is a great time. - This is a great time. - This is a perfect time. - I can't think of anything else I'd rather do on a Saturday night. - Like I said, I was talkin' about before we found him. - We're all makin' assumptions here. We don't know shit. - All I know is that mother fucker tormented him the whole fuckin' time. - Yeah. But that still doesn't make him a killer. - [Man] You're tormenting him now, okay. - Doesn't make him a killer. - Guys, all I know is I'm gonna put somebody in the fire. - [Steve] That's all I'm doing is being rational. - Stop defending him. - I'm being rational. Did you see him kill him, no you didn't. - None of us did. - So you can't make that assumption. - I'm just goin' by what I fuckin' know. - Well you don't know anything, you weren't there. - [Wade] All I know is that he fuckin' tormented him all fuckin' weekend. - Tormenting and killing are two different things. - [Anthony] We all saw that. - Two different things. - We all saw that, Wade. - He attacked him on three different occasions. How you gonna fuckin' sit here and yell at me when he fuckin' attacked him on three different occasions? - All I am tellin' you is be rational. You don't know all the facts. - Man, I came out here for you. I didn't come out here for this shit. - [Anthony] Well I didn't expect this shit to happen. - Yeah but we told you to send that mother fucker home. - [Anthony] And I didn't and this happened. - And you didn't. - I realized that. It's not my fault, I didn't kill him. - [Steve] He didn't do it, why are you jumping on him? - All I said was send that mother fucker home from the get, you told me when you picked me up, shit was goin' down, I said let it be cool. - [Anthony] I told you that there was a little argument in the morning, I didn't think it would come to this. - What's this? What's fuckin' this? Say it. Don't sit there and be quiet and just hold the fucking camera, say it, you know what this is. - [Anthony] I am partially responsible. You think I don't know that? - I don't know how many times we told you send that mother fucker home, you told me to be fuckin' cool, be fuckin' cool. - I know. I know. - Kept tellin' that mother fucker to chill the fuck out. All fuckin' weekend. - Why don't you take your own advice now? - Yeah. - Chill out. - Exactly. - [Anthony] We're so sorry we didn't listen to you, Wade. - [Steve] You're doing exactly what he was doing. Why don't you just chill out now? - He's not here, I'm not tormenting anybody. - [Steve] You're tormenting us now. You're blaming Anthony for his death. - [Anthony] Well I can take partial responsibility 'cause I let. - You're not responsible. - [Anthony] I let it happen, I let it go on. - [Steve] You didn't let anything happen. That was not your fault. - All of us have agreed that we should've sent him home a long time ago. - [Anthony] Poor Wade, we didn't listen to Wade, poor Wade. - Oh, it's my fault now. - No. I never said it was your fault, I'm not casting blame. - Oh yeah, poor Wade. - Don't act so high and mighty like you knew how to handle the situation from the get go. - I told you. - Yeah you told me. - You told me to be cool. So I was cool. - I didn't listen. But neither did anybody else. - I was cool. And look what happened. - [Anthony] Neither did anybody else. - [Wade] Everybody told you to send him home and you were like nah. - No. I think you were the only one. - [Wade] Dude, check your fuckin' tape. - [Anthony] I don't need to check my fuckin' tape. - Yo guys, I'm really sorry. - Wade, I'm sorry too. - I'm sorry too. It's just. - Horrible. What the, Jim, Jim what are you doin'? Jim, what are you doing, Jim, Jim?
