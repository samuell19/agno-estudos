The night is full of meteor showers. I watch them flip through the starry sky toward the horizon. Late in the night, I lie on the couch wishing a meteor might land in my room. All at once the window swells with pale blue light. (air whooshing) The softly shimmering blaze settles on the carpet. Its steadies and it resolves into a girl wearing pale blue pajamas. I make room for her on the couch. She tells me about her life in the sky, how brief it is, how dark the distance is between the stars, but how exquisite the sights slipping into the atmosphere blazing softly, "And now it's over," she sighs. "And here I am with you." We lie together with my arm around her. She gazes out the window, lost in thought. A tear starts down her cheek. "What's wrong?" I whisper. "Nothing," she says, "I can see in the future that's all." "Well then why are you sad?" "Because," she says, "First we'll be happy and then we'll be sad, that's just the way it will be for us." "No," I protest, "That's not true at all. I've fallen in love with you, I'll be with you always." She only smiles hearing what I say as she gazes out at the heavens and the dreaming stars. (crowd clapping) Of course, she left the next morning and didn't leave her number. (crowd laughing) And I start to ask myself, "Do I have a little problem? Am I the type of guy they call a hopeless romantic?" Accent on hopeless. But why? Why the sadness of sex? I never took a vow against love and happiness. Where did all these problems start? (upbeat music) My childhood wasn't that different from everyone else's. I was what used to be called a sensitive boy, but there were lots of family activities, loads of family fun and games. I can honestly say mom and dad were really great sports in all sorts of ways. My father titters, "He has turned himself into a girl." (girl laughing) A throng of blonde curls sits on his balding head. A powder pink sweater stretches to the point of ripped seams over the bra bumps of his burly chest. He swishes about in the parlor, preening and giggling, and then heads off waddling down the back hall A hand bent wristed on his hip out into the garden in the moonlight. I stare at him from out the kitchen window. Lifting his little fingers he holds his hands out far to either side and bends his big nose and sniffs a hydrangea. (sniffs) He petter patters in place delighted with what he smells. Shaken I go upstairs and break the news to my mother. My mother puts down her sewing. She crosses to the sewing room window. "Yes, I see what you mean," she says. She sighs, she turns back into the room, shaking her head, mysteriously a smile plays at the corner of her lips. She goes out to her and my father's bedroom, when she reappears she has on black tie and tails, a top hat and a cloak. She carries a cane, she squints jauntily through a monocle, the thin line of a mustache is penciled across her upper lip. "Dearie," she announces, "I think it's best if you go to bed now. The sort of an evening is for adults." She pats me on the cheek, seeing how shocked and speechless I am. She winks and steps off in a swirl of a cloak. From the bedroom window I stare down open mouth into the garden. The slight top hated figure of my mother strides out toward the bloated pixie who is my father. (upbeat music) (women giggling) My father wiggles shyly at the sight at my mother's advance and then retreats one coy step and then another, and then scampers off heavily into the rhododendron bushes. His sweater comes flying out powder pink in the moonlight. My mother snatches it in midair and brandishes her cane in a lusty display of enthusiasm. And she crouches, she stalks towards the rhododendrons calling ahead teasingly. Suddenly she stops. She straightens and looks about a flying kid glove bangs against the screen of my window. "Go to sleep," my mother's voice orders from below. I turn off the lamp. After a while I lie down, as bidden, but I can't sleep. I stare in confusion at the ceiling, hearing laughter from the garden and the strangest of noises. - [Narrator] Do you realize what would happen if every man in the country that wanted to wear women's clothes or felt like a woman went to their doctors and wanted a sex change? (upbeat music) - [Narrator] Lust, debauchery, perversion in its extreme, "Sex Madness," coming soon to this theater. (upbeat music) (crowd laughing) - Imagine what it was like bringing girlfriends home to that house. Not that I had any girlfriends, not that I really knew a girl. I was very young and fearful and shy, but at the same time, almost certifiably eager. I guess everybody's first clumsy ventures with the opposite sex were nightmares. But for me, I must say dating was apocalyptic. - How do you choose a date? Whose company would you enjoy? Well, one thing you can consider is looks. Whether you thought of Janice and how good looking she was. Yes, he'd enjoy that, except, well, it's too bad Janice always acts so superior and bored. She'd make a fellow feel awkward and inferior. Well, perhaps someone who doesn't feel superior. There's Betty, and yet it just doesn't seem as if she'd be much fun. What about Anne? She knows how to have a good time and how to make the fellow with her relax, have fun too. Yes. That's what a boy likes. He wants to know he's appreciated and would be fun on a date. - My date calls to tell me she has a big surprise waiting for me when I pick her up. This really electrifies me. I hear she's a pretty wild customer. She must have something extra special cooked up. I leave my sports coat and sweater in the closet and get out my zebra striped dovetail coat. It's totally outrageous. But after that phone call, I know I have the nerve to pull it off. (crowd laughing) I look in the mirror and there I am, a little kinky, but definitely loaded with sexy pizzazz. I am going to bowl her over. I dance up the stairs to her place, an exotic bunch of feathered flowers in my fist. I punch the buzzer on the downbeat of the little tuna keg. There's no answer. "It's all part of the surprise of course," I whinnied like a horse and push open the door. "Surprise," a voice squeaks. I look around. Finally I see her. She's on the sofa. I drop the flowers. My mouth falls open. She's barely 12 inches tall. "It took me all day," she says, "I'm not quite dry yet, so why don't you make yourself a drink before we go?" I have my drink. Then another, then another. I'm in too much shock to say anything. When she says she's, "Ready," I finally get my voice back and try to talk her having dinner where we are. But she insists on going out as planned. "Well, do you think this is too much for you to handle?" She inquires coyly. "Of course not," I retort, "Why should it be?" (upbeat music) In the restaurant she sits on the table on an overturned cup. (crowd laughing) I've picked out the darkest, most isolated booth in the place, but even so, people won't stop staring. They don't touch their food. They just lean out of their seats and crane their necks and stare. I'm so embarrassed. I can hardly see straight. My date loves it. She has me mash up a ravioli and feed it to her with a matchstick. She asked me if I still think I can handle it. "You bet I can," I tell her fiercely. I can see now exactly what her little game is. "All right then," she smirks, "Give me some wine." I shove the glass in front of her before I realized the effect a few sips are gonna have. Immediately she gets cock-eyed. She gives me a lascivious wink licking her lips. She slides off the cup and starts doing a strip tease. Horrified, I hiss at her, "Cut it out." She leaves at me. "I thought you could take it," she squeaks. In a panic I grab a napkin and hold it up around her. She hauls up her her skirt, she's stark naked. (crowd laughing) She pitches headlong on my plate and starts rolling around in the spaghetti. The waiter appears at my shoulder to clear off the dishes. He stares at the heaving napkin. I grin up a team with all my teeth and shrug my shoulders. He looks at me strangely and says he will come back later. By now, my date has a piece of spaghetti worked in between her legs. She is ooing and aahing squealing at me. What do I think now? What do I think now? People are buzzing, rising from their chairs. The waiter is on his way back with the maître d'. Frantically I throw down some money. I clear my date up in the napkin and bolt to my feet and shove wriggling and screaming under my coat. I get 10 feet towards the exit and bang, the force of an explosion knocks me flying. I come to in a heap under a table. My date is sprawled on her back in the middle of the floor. She is shockingly full sized smeared with tomato sauce and spaghetti. Her ass is churning away furiously her hands clutching her thighs. "Come on your little prick," she roars. "Come on, come on, let's see you handle of big fat man-sized mama!" (crowd laughing) (upbeat music) When I was young, you see, I thought I'd grow wiser about women and love as I grew older. I couldn't wait to grow older. I thought, "Sure, things seem confusing right now, even alarming, but time and experience will explain everything." I thought older men knew something about sex that I didn't yet understand. Well I was right. (dramatic music) (match striking) I get involved in a game of poker, strip poker. (dramatic music) The others have somehow persuaded a cow to join in. (cow mooing) The cow stands stupid and uncomfortable in the cigar smoke. My table mates ply it with booze. It is decked out in a pathetic catalog of bedroom apparel. Naturally, it always plays a losing hand. It can't manage with his garments and everyone makes full use of the opportunity to handle it in the name of assistance. I watch in disgust as a beefy bank manager type fumbles with a lacy garter on the cow's flank. His hands are trembling. "Would you look at those adders? Will you look at those adders," he keeps mumbling his face is flush crimson. The cow shifts a leg, quaking, big eyed. "Count me out," I mutter. Finally, I throw in my cards for good. Without further ceremony, I push back my chair and go out onto the patio. I take a couple of deep breaths. The salacious laughter rises behind me. I hurry off and steadily down the steps, drunk, feeling unclean and despicable. "These package vacations are a nightmare," I think to myself. In this frame of mind I wander about the lakefront for an hour. Not a soul is about. Lugubriously I make my way back to the patio steps. I stop. The sound of mooing goes out into the night above the swarming of abandoned laughter. The yelps in the cries. Silhouetted shadows come and go in the french windows, horns toss about and disappear. Soundly, I turn to leave again when the French windows burst open. The bank manager staggers out into the moonlight. He wheels down the steps his shirt tails loose, his suspenders flapping at his knees and lurches straight into me. "Oh my God, oh my God," he moans, half in ecstasy half in horror. I shove him away from me. His face is smeared with milk. (dramatic music) What do men want? There's only one thing in the world I wanted. I wanted it. Technically I wanted to lose it. I wanted to cross that final silken barrier. The air would throb around me visibly whenever I would think about it. The air just throbbed all the time. And how on earth was I going to act if by some act of God I managed to get it? Well, since I was young, fearful, shy, obviously ignorant, I was gonna act like an expert. (upbeat music) I'm in bed with a girl for the very first time. - [Woman] Ooh. - I brought her back to my place. I think she's pretty impressed, but I'm playing it very cool. This is all a bit new to me, but luckily I've got the best manual money can buy. I'm not going to disappoint her. (crocodile whistles) By foreplay with the controlled exquisiteness of a French (speaking in foreign language) I lock horns with a steady langer of an eastern swami, timeless and temperate. And then suddenly I kicked the whole thing into overdrive, a lumberjack and a brand new Cadillac. Off we roar down the coast highway. Rolls about the light crashes over us, drenches us in a hot shower of (indistinct). We roll (indistinct) in a daze and immediately I grove for the cigarettes to celebrate. But in all the excitement, her legs have somehow gotten over rearranged. Unbelievably her legs are backwards. But I know in my heart that if I really do a thorough job on her, really extecize in a way she's obviously never been before, just straighten out. I fling myself into the task with messianic relish. ♪ Here we go, here we go, here we go. ♪ - At the last minute, I wheel her on top of me and make like an oil derrick. We reenact the discovery of oil, I gushed (indistinct). I pull out from under her collapsed form and gasping from exhaustion I forage under the sheets I check her heels. I check her as I sit back panting and vindicated. Everything's pointing in the same direction just as I knew it would be, including I realize her breasts. Her breast is sticking out of the middle of her back. I sink back to the pillows glowering. It goes like this all afternoon. When her breasts are right, her hands are wrong. When her hands are right, the cheeks of her ass snuggle up under her belly. Finally, the parts of her body are in a hopeless angle and I give up. (dramatic music) (woman moaning) I watch as she dresses hasty and competent despite the jumble of anatomy. She has an appointment to keep. She sits at the bureau, humming to herself as she combs out the long red banner of her hair with a grotesquely misplaced hand. She dabs a little extra brightness on her lips. A practiced fingertip brushes once, twice, just above the top knob of her spine where her lips happen to be. She comes over to me when she's done and contorts herself to press her hand to my cheek. "Thanks," she smiles, "It was just utterly swell." She might as well have said, "Better luck next time." I watch dismally as she strolls out, pausing at the door to throw back a tangled kiss, the unregenerate cubism of her body making a mockery of the grand tradition of my powers. Maybe I just wasn't built for romance. Maybe I would be the one guy in the whole world who just didn't get it. Maybe it was all over me before it started, maybe. And then one day all these maybes became irrelevant. It was a day just like any other. I woke up alone, nothing unusual, made coffee, nothing unusual, decided to go out for a stroll and a second cup of coffee. And I had no idea you see no idea at all that this was the day, this was the very day love was lying in wait for me. (dramatic music) I sit in a cafe in late morning browsing the paper for news of the day. I become aware of a presence just out of the corner of my eye. A girl hurries by, she gives me a distracted smile. (dramatic music) She's quite pretty in an appealing way. I stir hardly at my coffee. I stir it with a spoon that trembles. (mellow music) A while later she goes by again. (mellow music) I can't stop myself, I look. (dramatic music) She's not pretty I realize, she's lovely. She's utterly woundingly lovely. (dramatic music) I groan, clutch onto the little round table with both hands. (mellow music) "Oh no, not this," I think, tossing my head from side to side. "Not this, no, no, no." I wrench myself to my feet and plunge back out into the sidewalk and lurch up against the side of the building panting, chest heaving, passers by turn their heads. I fumble with a handkerchief over my face, gasping, clenching my teeth, "You fool," I abrade myself. "You irresponsible fool," I strike my thigh with my fist. I push off wildly and start tottering down the sidewalk. Apparitions of beauty invade me, overwhelm me. Images of her dance before my eyes. (dramatic music) A young couple on their way to Lake Crescent shrink back outta the path ahead of me. A terrible icy shudder goes through me, the couple squeal in unison against the parked cars. I give out a barking cry of protest and sink down heavily to my knees a few yards before them. I twist about this way and that thrashing the air with frantic clamoring arms. "Help me," but it's no use. The hideous toxin of love has been ingested and has taken. A spasm racks my body as powerfully and copiously almost luxuriously. Down there in all fours, I begin to vomit out a tide of rose petals and perfume bottle, scars and scraps of desperately scribbled love letters on expensive note paper and packets of intimate photos with swooning inscriptions and torn pages of chic music stained with tears and the notes of that one special song. The whole noxious adoring mess, shoots and oozes over the pavement. Bubbling hazardous spill lethal with the debris of infatuation. And this was in fact how I met her. Her, the girl of my dreams, the Juliet to my Romeo, the Jane to my Tarzan, and the Beauty to my Beast, the eggs to my (speaking in foreign language), her. Of course, we didn't literally meet as such. I'm not positive she even noticed me. In fact, she probably doesn't know I exist. But no matter, for now I am in love. And love makes me bold. (mellow music) (woman yodeling) I track the girl of my dreams through the park. (woman yodeling) (dramatic music) My little friend is helping, it's slow going. Not for nothing has my friend acquired his reputation for being a lot of trouble, whimsical to the point of unruliness. It's one headache after another with him. He requires constant attention. He's all false alarms and rushing off madly in all directions and then aimless wandering here and there. Also the stubby wings my friend spots are in fact just ornamental so I have to lug him about all the time so he can keep up. The arrows in his quiver jab in the back of the neck. I have to put him down repeatedly and make him rearrange things. But the girl is impeded also. She has bags of groceries and shopping with her. We've gotten close enough once to wound her but naturally this has had the added disadvantage of putting her vehemently on guard. We plot along our woodland section. We've lost sight of her for several minutes. But now my friend gives a shout, "Where?" I huff. "Over there," he cries pointing with his chubby little hand. I spot the tawny blonde head. Suddenly it disappears among the autumn leaves. "I'll cut her off," I cry, wheeling and lumbering off the path in pursuit. Almost immediately I catch my foot and the two of us go sprawling cursing we hurriedly retrieved the petite silver bow and bright scattered arrows. We remount and hectically I plod along. We're in luck. We crouch behind an architectural fragment. On a bench in a clearing directly beyond us the girl has had to pause with her shopping bags to catch her breath. She looks right and left in great consternation. "All right," I whisper, "This time, make sure it's a good shot." "This breeze is kind of tricky," my friend mutters glancing about with a screwed up eyes. He fits an arrow to its string. Suddenly we whirl around. A figure looms over us. It's a large woman with a walking stick. "Hello there," she announces, "My what a handsome child." "Are you going to shoot something?" "Beat it grandma," my friend rasps savagely. "For Christ's sake, lady," I add, "He happens to be thousands of years old. Can't you see we're busy?" I demand. The woman looks shocked. She retreats. We wrench back around. "She's onto us," my friend cries, "She's bolting." The girl is on her feet backing away from the bench looking wildly about in our general direction. She turns to flee. "Shoot, shoot," I yell. The arrow flashes wide in the slanting light. The girl veers and squeezes fluttering her hands and rushes off across the leaf, scattered grass. "She's going for cover over there," I cried. "The pond's back that way she won't have any way out. I'll go around and close her off and drive her back this way. When she breaks, you get her," I admonish fiercely. I go rushing into the clearing past the bench and the abandoned monogram shopping bags and head over along the far side of the undergrowth. My heart soars with the thrill of the chase. I wheel about and start in stamping loudly and hollering stentorian endearments. "My sweetest of the sweet, my beloved," I shout. "My permanent rose. My autumn heart's golden apple." At last I hear her wounded voice quailing, "Please." It cries from someone not too far off. "I confess I do find you unexpectedly, profoundly attractive. But my personal life has other priorities right now." "Oh, but true love is merciless," I bellow. "It won't take no for an answer." I crash towards a voice with red redoubled, violence, stamping, and thrashing. Suddenly there's a clamor and a thicket nearby. "She's breaking. She's breaking," I shout hectically. I go swarming back out into the clearing. The girl bursts into the open not 20 feet away. She leaps across the clearing. Gorgeous in full flight, in the splendid gold of the afternoon. A waring flash stuns her in her tracks. Throws her arms out magnificently wide as if to the dying grandeur of the trees all around her. Then she twists and sinks down to her knees and pitches over sideways onto the grass. I come rushing up. I kneel over her. I gaze down at the girl. The silvery shaft protrudes its precious wrought feathers just off center out of her blouse. The shot struck her dead in the heart. She looks utterly beautiful. "Are you all right?" I'm inquire gently. "Are you all right?" She looks up at me, her eyes slowly focusing with dewy radiance. "I've never felt this wonderful in my life," she says with a trembling little laugh. "You've always been the only one for me," she adds. "Oh my darling," I tell her. Our lips meet. We kiss tenderly, deeply extravagantly. My little friend watches from nearby leaning on his bow pink cheeked with embarrassment. Suddenly he pushes his bow aside and he turns and hoots and with his pudgy legs bent, he shoots a thin celebratory arc of silvery water out into the afternoon light over the glorious wind blown leaves.

And when you're in love, you get the pleasures of dealing with intimacy. (mellow music) While my girlfriend sleeps, I lean among the bed clothes and gently wiggle loose the top of her cranium. Then I edge closer and inspect the contents of my sleeping girlfriend's mind. (dramatic music) A parade of memorabilia wanders through. I smile in affection as a plate of butterscotch follows from dinner last Sunday at her mother's. I note the card from the flowers I gave her for no reason at all a few nights ago. I murmur endearment to this under my breath. Now a see your mouth, my own kissing her goodnight. The lips loom huge and close and blot out all else. Then a bulge of herringbone appears from the trouser she bought much too baggy, but which she insists on wearing with that trademark obstinacy of hers. I shake my head at this farrago of apparel. My lips reappear for a reprise, they look odd. Suddenly the sleepy grin on my face goes stiff. "Those aren't my lips at all." All at once I place them, they're from that repellent pseudo hipster my girlfriend did the graphics work for last week. I blink as they offer a lurid smooching kiss. I met him when she turned the pieces in and he put in his flirty little act for her benefit. I glare at his hairless upper lip as it slowly dissolves as my girlfriend's new aerobic shoes thumping away in her exercise class. In the morning we have our coffee at our table by the window. "All right," my girlfriend declares at length, "What's it all about? Why the mood this morning?" "Nothing," I mutter from behind my paper. "Don't tell me that. Come on out with it. You've been hunched there in complete silence, radiating ill will. Is it me? Tell me what I've done." I look at her, my jaw sets. "I was just mulling over," I tell her, "Why you should be smooching it up somewhere last week with that goofball you did the poster for that's all." My girlfriend stares at me. She blushes violently. "Who told you that? You were spying on me!" "No, I wasn't spying as such," I retaught. "You deny it happened? "No, I don't deny it," she admits going red again, "But it it wasn't anything. He's just sort of an enthusiastic and he got carried away for a moment. But I told him I already had a boyfriend." "Oh really? How thoughtful of you?" "But how did you know," She demands, "Who told you?" "I have non-conventional sources," I inform her. "Oh, you do?" "Yes I do." She pushes my paper down on the table. "Listen, you're getting jam all over the sports section." I sit back with a sigh of exasperation. She gazes at me narrowly cocking her head. A shrewd look plays on her face. "Perhaps now you might explain to me," she said, "Why you were trying to chew your way through the neck of that half naked mutant of a florist assistant out behind the beach party last Friday." Now it's my turn to exhibit a deep shade of red. I squirm in my chair. "But how did you?" "And I had no idea," she continues, "That last Wednesday you were closing your eyes while we were being intimate. You were away in your mind for a full minute bagging groceries in the nude with that cute little checkout girl from down in the market." I blink at her. "I but..." My girlfriend sits back eyeing me tartly. "Just be advised there are games two can play at," she warns. She tilts her head. "Did you notice your ears don't quite line up this morning?" How careless of me. (somber music) How long can anyone remain in love? The French say, "A love affair, by definition, can't last more than a thousand days, three years. How long can what one person wants be sacrificed to support what two people need? And if you have to change yourself, however slightly to be with someone, what are you hiding? There are two things to do on a rainy day. (mellow music) The other one is to play cards. (mellow music) I'm in bed with my girlfriend whose body I realize seems somehow enticingly different. When we start nuzzling, my nostrils fill with something sweet, something heavenly. Veritably I put out my tongue, I nibble, my palate swoons, feverishly I start munching. "Stop it!" She cries. She shoves me away hard. She thrashes to a sitting position. I knew what she says. "You're only interested in me for damn my strawberries." "Of course not," I retort trying to look sincerely shocked, "How can you say that? It's merely I've never experienced anything like this before. And they are, well, frankly, delicious. My favorite fruit. But that's all, honestly. "It's what they all say," she snorts. Look enough nibbling. How's about the real thing huh?" "Of course," I tell her, "Just one more teensy snack for energy?" "No," she roars, twisting head away and smacking a fist into the quilt. "Sex or nothing." "Okay, okay," I tell her, "No need to get all worked up." So I climb aboard and start up. (dramatic music) But it's hard to keep your mind on its proper business what with your nose pressed against her jaw. It is teased with the most delicious fruity essences. "Look, I'm really sorry," I finally have to say getting off and stretching limply by her side. For some reason she bursts into quiet, terrible sobs. "Oh God, I wish I were dead," she moans, burying her cheeks in the pillows. I lean over her feeling heart sore and stricken and ashamed. Obviously this all touches some awful central problem in her life. Some rotting prop under her self-image, and I've simply gone gorging my way into it. She's clearly extraordinarily sensitive. I know she is, and I've shown no consideration whatsoever. Just typical thoughtless egotism. "Please listen to me, it's all my fault," I whisper. "I'm a real jerk and A1 prick. You're gorgeous and sexy as anything, you know you are. To hell with the strawberries. They mean nothing to me. Nothing. Not a thing." But even as I caress and stroke her, even as I plead with her, to be assured, even as I excoriate myself and my selfishness, my heedlessness, my brutality, the aromas work away at my fuddled brain. Helplessly I feel my mouth start to creep back down. Helplessly I feel it surround her nip and start to chew. Helpless and choking I swallow in an agony of deliciousness in remorse as she weeps as twists around under me, inconsolable. ♪ Let me call you sweetheart, I'm in love with you ♪ ♪ Let me hear you whisper that you love me too ♪ ♪ Keep the love light burning ♪ - "First we'll be very happy and then we'll be sad. That's just the way it will be for us," she said. "No," I protested, "That's not true at all. I've fallen in love with you. I'll be with you always. I'll be with you always." I wake up in bed next to me is a woman I've never seen before. I stare at the sleeping face. I have no idea who she is. I look around the dim room. There's a bureau and a mirror, an armchair with a hodgepodge of clothing, more clothing scattered on the frail oriental rug. I've never seen any of these things before. I lift the covers away gingerly and put my bare feet on the floor. Again, I look down at the sleeping face. I try to remember, "What happened last night?" I can't seem to, I try to think of my own name. I gape about wildly, there're trousers on the armchair in a back pocket is a wallet. It contains some dollar bills. Otherwise it's empty. My heart gives a sudden sickened jolt. (man screams) I realize I can't in fact remember anything. The sound of a voice makes me turn around. "Who are you? Who are you?" The woman is lying with the covers drawn up around her chin as if trying to protect herself. The look on her face is a mixture of alarm and confusion as if she weren't sure she had woken or was still dreaming. "Who are you?" She repeats. I open my mouth, but then I just begin shaking my head. ( sighs) "I don't know," I confess helpless to answer her simple, eternal question, I stare at her dismally in the gloom. Her eyes widen in the increments of a slowly deepening, bewildered horror. "Who are you?" I ask. A long, peculiar silence follows this. "I dunno." (mellow music) (waves crashing) I go to the train station to meet my girlfriend. I haven't seen her for a while. (train rumbling) (somber music) (train rumbling) The train comes in, but my girlfriend isn't on it. (mellow music) A conductor covered with snow informs me that my girlfriend has had plastic surgery without telling me, and the operation got fouled up. Now she's too ashamed ever to see me. (somber music) I go home, multitude of ambivalence is battling within me. I keep peering about for anyone swathed in bandages, in case you might have come out here secretly on the bus. Back at home the phone is ringing, but I don't answer it. I'm too distraught. The ringing goes on a long time before stopping. Suddenly I start to feel guilty. "What if that was her? What if she really needed me?" There's a knock at the front door. (dramatic music) The train conductor stands on the threshold, dripping, the tear rolls down his cheek. "Didn't you recognize me?" (somber music) I realized that the source of all the misery in my life is my heart. (thunder rumbling) I decide to take extreme measures. I liquor myself up and in the privacy of my kitchen under the bare light bulb, I perform a crude, hideous, but at last successful cardiac removal using the big parsley chopping knife and a series of soup spoons and a knife with a short all-purpose blade. Grimacing with distaste, my hand slippery with gore, I clap the vile thudding knob of misfortune up in a plastic leftovers container. The floor about my shoes is splattered with crimson and shackles. I slink out into the back alley to a small park in the neighborhood. (dramatic music) Shake the ex organ out into the litter amid some bushes and fling the empty container to other bushes a distance away and dodge off heavily into the broken lamp darkness. I regained my back door glass breathing with difficulty. Huge drops of icy sweat beading my gray flesh, but no one is following me, no one shouts alarm. The remains of the nighter very bad. So are the next several days I collapse into a kind of delirium. But even as I twist about gasping in my stained sheets, even as I fumble all multiple thumbs in the bathroom with my preposterously, unsanitary, makeshift surgical dressing, I'm all smiles. (man laughs) My head veers in and outta the bathroom mirror frame, but the edges of my double vision radiate a profound existential beneficence, quivering halo of joy. In not much more than a week I'm back in my feet as good as ever, apart from a certain concavity of posture. Also for a good while I tire easily. But really so what? I start dating with voracious abandon. My love life, so-called becomes a scenario of boundless activity and astonishing brazenness. Whomever strikes my fancy then and there I make a scrolling beeline for her. Bishy, that strange sinuous Gamare spotted slouching at a street corner. Bishy, yonder jet said hottie sitting croft and cross-legged and contemptuous over her pair of teeth. I present what's on my mind with forthright brass. "Excuse me, but are you aware that you in particular would look mesmerizing in costly satin sheets?" "Good afternoon, may I caress you for hours in the most delightful manner?" Often I'm snubbed. Quite often it's true, laughed at more times than I care to admit. I'm toyed with, but time's enough I charm sensationally. I woo with unearthly impunity. I take unfazed possession of quite a number of souls. I treat more than one with less humanity, alas than probably I should. I have girlfriends galore and sooner or later for reasons of my own, I move on to others. In a word, sometimes I win all there is to win between the sexes. Other times the word is short with two brusk letters, "No." Occasionally I'm let down after truly duplicitous, well my pathological manipulations. But listen to me, hear this, it never matters. Whatever succeeds succeeds, whatever fails fails because I don't feel a single thing (laughs). No pangs, no torments, no soulful, wrenching or yearnings. No disturbing ecstasies, no twinnings of celestial privicies just the invigorations of activity. (upbeat music) Rewarded by occasional carnal delectations or else a mild sigh of fleeting annoyance as if a bug had flung itself against the freshly polished sheen of a display window. "How is it you always seem so nonchalant? So thoroughly possessed?" (indistinct) My girlfriends will earnestly inquire, wandering the pleasant confines of my living room. "I've moved up since my fateful surgery." "How can you be that way all the time?" They want to know. I smile at them from the drinks table and I shrug. (thunder crashing) I go back to mixing cocktails. (upbeat music) In the silence, they wander over to the fashionable red velvet sofa and settle down musing and take up a picture in a silver frame. "where is this God awful place?" They say with a puzzled frown. "And why should you who is quintessentially stylish keep a picture of such a God awful place with little bushes in such an exquisite frame?" "Like something from an altar." My eyes light up as I pass across the chilled martini glass and ease back into a neighboring cushion. "Oh, something very wonderful once happened to me there," I say with a mysterious smile. "That's where I died and was reborn. "Oh, as a ladies man?" (upbeat music) I nod slow. (thunder crashing) "That's me." (dramatic music) (woman screaming) (woman screaming) (glass breaking) (car tires screeching) I hear about a revolt. (guns banding) I go down into the streets. It's night buildings are gutted, smoldering some in rubble. Obviously there was a struggle of great violence. (people screaming) Under a sulfur street lamp a beautiful girl paces back and forth apparently standing guard for the new regime. But all she has on her red fers and a pair of satin herring bloomers. Her face is heavily made up and her bare breasts are tipped with rouge. "Now I understand," I think uneasily, "What they meant was women of the world have rebelled against the old order and it's taking over, taking over." (women screaming) I move along with a show of nervous secrest modesty. I hear a clamor, I look up ahead, a furious mob burst suddenly interview. It's all half naked ladies, tricked out in garter belts and lacy undies. With tasseled whips hey drive before them one of the masters of the old order. His fancy silken suit is torn and ripped and his pomaded hair, a spiky mess. The sight of his face makes me gasp. "He looks just like me," I stammer. (dramatic music) (women shrieking) "My God, it's happened. They discovered that in my heart of hearts I bear the tawdry sensibilities of a pimp and a pornographer." I shrink back as far as I can into the shadows of a ruined doorway and gnaw my wrist is my gruesome double comes stumbling past. His dyed mustache is all aquiver. His eyes are fish like with fright. For one brief instant, his eyes find mine. (dramatic music) A look of anguished recognition fixes me. Then the mob thunders down on his back, flailing and screaming. I press myself as far as I can into the doorways as the riot he route sweeps on past and turns onto the next street recklessly. I hear the cries receding. I lower my arm, trembling from in front of my face. "Somehow I haven't been recognized. I've gotta get out of here," I think. "I've gotta get back to the safety of my own room. I've gotta get out of here," I think. I peer out into the street. It's empty, but the pinup of a guard is still in her post under the lamp, cursing her sense of duty I watch her, waiting for her gorgeous back to be turned. Feverishly I dart out my shabby wrinkled catches on a nail. The pocket yawns enormously and something topples out and flops onto the sidewalk. "It's a girly magazine." I stare at it riveted with horror, "It's a girly magazine." I reach down for it. I look about wildly. I break off and flee down the sidewalk. I reach my room and frantically I throw the bolt. I drop all the blinds, (pants) with a thumping heart I peek down at the street. (panting) It looks tranquil as far as I can tell, but elsewhere, something dreadful is stirring I begin to realize. I stared down at myself. "Oh my God, not now," I gasp, "This is terrible." I fumble with myself rearranging, but I keep sticking out. "Go down," I admonish, desperately fumbling. Sirens rise suddenly from the street outside. I look about in a panic. I rush over to the sofa then tear off the blanket and start wrapping it around myself. There's a pounding on my door. I freeze. "Open up," a woman's voice shouts. "Open up in the name of liberty." "Who? Who is it again?" I inquire a thin voice. "I don't believe I quite caught." "Open up," the voice shouts, "Open up or we'll burn you out!" "All right, all right," I mutter. I waddle over to the door and I pull back the bolt. (dramatic music) The hallway is filled with grim, voluptuous, militia, half naked in their red fesses smokey flames of wooden tapers throb among them. Swaddled in plaid. I look at them. "All right, it's over, you've got me I admit," and I hang my head blushing. A great cheer goes up, red nailed hand sees me roughly. I don't resist as they start hauling me off downstairs. The stairwell rings with a hubbub of gloating cries, scorned for old. Halfway down, I suddenly decide that, "If I am gonna face my end for being what I am, then I shall be just what I am." (dramatic music) "What I am," I think. Flinging back my head practically I search for most gorgeous one of the lot in my vicinity. I spot her over by the banister. With a defiant cry I heave myself (indistinct) in my blanket onto her plunging down through the crowd to press my kisses against a silky perfumed struggling throat under a hail of shouts and blows until the crescendo of clawing and battering overcomes me at last and I dissolve into soft, triumphant (indistinct). (dramatic music) (woman screaming) (dramatic music) (man screaming) In the middle of my life, I woke to find myself in a dark wood. I had lost my way. - [Reporter] We interrupt this broadcast to bring you a news flash. (women screaming) (eerie dramatic music) - A woman's sex breaks loose from between her legs and escapes out into the streets. It terrorizes a residential neighborhood for an entire afternoon. A dapper old geezer makes a mistake of jointly trying to handle it right after its appearance on the sidewalk and gets a finger bitten for his presumption. A gang of teenage truants who taunted in a gardener driven away howling it flaps and seethes after them snapping off the sticks and baseball bats with which they try to fend it away. One of the youths relates his terrified drama with the radio of how he tripped and fell down and only saved himself hiding for over an hour in a trashcan while not two feet away in the alley it squatted, gnawing on a rusty bicycle pump. Most disturbingly a dozen school children on their way back from a museum visit, are traumatized by the sheer sight of it. They huddle together, wailing and sobbing long after it has disappeared. Every so often a single childish voice still burst into pathetic screams. The teacher can be heard gasping on the radio in half sentences, "Turned the young psyches, she said, "And in ruins." Afraid she repeats numerous times. Around dusk the escapee scuttles up into an elm tree and there the authorities surround it. It keeps them at bay flapping and spitting from the branches. Policeman crawls up with a snaring pole and has a wrench from his hands, a nasty stalemate ensues. Now listen to the account of all this being broadcast on the radio. (dramatic music) Someone's at my door. (door knocking) It's a bulky, worried looking man wearing in the old fashioned manner a hat. He announces himself as a deputy to the mayor. "Can I come in?" He says. (dramatic music) He gets right to business. "And not only is it a public outrage, but it's only a matter of time before someone loses more than a finger," he grins with difficulty. "A terrible embarrassment to the city and the mayor. Something has gotta be done immediately. You've got to help us." "May I ask why me? What about the woman to whom, how shall I put it? It belongs?" He shakes his head. "She's too distraught," he says. "Well, you can imagine, how would you feel in her position?" He asks coloring slightly in the lamplight. I don't answer. He leans close. "We all know your books down at City Hall," he says, "We're big fans. We think you have a special understanding, a facility about these sensitive matters. That wild story about the strawberries and that other one about the 12 inch Dame Rose." "Then you'll also know full well that I've just gone through a tremendously difficult and disabling time, won't you?" I interrupt. I walk over to the mentor. "I'm in no position to have a relationship right now," I mutter and my back towards him. "My God, no one's asking you to have a relationship," He protests. "We're simply asking for your help for just one evening." I don't answer. I stare at the mantle. "Please," he beseeches from somewhere in the room behind. "We're desperate." "You know you're the only one we believe can save the situation. Think of the innocent people, the kids," he adds. I roll my eyes at the hyperboles. "What is this? A grade B cop thriller," I mutter. "What's that?" "Nothing," I sigh. I close my eyes. I run my hand over my face. "All right, I murmur, "All right, all right." I turn bluely towards him. "It'll take me a few minutes to get ready," I tell him. In the bathroom, my hand trembles as I shave and find the old cologne bottle and the jar of pomade. I take out the dark suit, the one I always look good in. I still do. I give my brown and white stripe tie, a last tug in the mirror, and I shake my head with a grunt at the ripple of memory and melancholy. "All right, let's go," I exclaimed somberly reemerging. To do this one 100%, I'd normally stop off for a boutonnière, but we don't have the time. (dramatic music) (sirens wailing) Our official car maneuvers through the police blockades, and we turn a final corner and the scene is in front of us. (dramatic music) Squad cars and firetrucks pack the end of the street like a disorganized mass of cattle. (flash clicking) A pair of spotlights are trained into the upper branches of the elm. A fire ladder probes the forbidding leafy darkness runs are empty and ominous. (child crying) (women shouting) The crowd, curious and frightened strain for the barricades for a glimpse of melodrama in the slow flashing of the squad car lamps. It's a circus, a bloodletting, a zoo. The cage doors broken. (sirens wailing) We pull up in the dying wail of a siren. I get out, the elm towers above me. (flashes clicking) (dramatic music) Grim and suave, I make my way through the squalled tumult toward the center of the outrage. (dramatic music) The deputy explains to the police chief who I am. The police chief is big and red-faced and very unhappy. "This is what I want," I declare my eyes fixed on the branches. "I want this entire street cleared. I want each damn one of these spotlights off. I want nothing here but this ladder (indistinct)." "There's no way," the police chief barks at me in outrage and protest. "Do you realize"- "Listen," I snap swinging about, "I do this my way or I don't do it at all." There's a stark pause taut with stares. "Do what he says," the mayor's deputy cries, "Do exactly what he says!" The chief swears and turns away he starts shouting burly through his bullhorn. 15 minutes later, the street is empty. There is only the elm and the ladder from its truck and me and the moonlight. The black hulk of the mayor's deputy's car watches from the end of the block with its lights off. I take a breath and look up along the diminishing metal parallels of the ladder. I whisper, "Good luck," wet my lips and start climbing. The only sounds in the street are my footsteps. mounting one after another from rung to rung and the lilt of the ballad I'm whistling. (eerie music) My eyes are fixed on the top of the ladder through the dark branches. I press slowly on, at last without incident my head and shoulders clear into the zone of high leaves. The scent in the moonlight is tangy and unadulterated. I pause there clutching on and whistling now in tender, ultra intimate tempo. The melody tugs soft and piercing at my heart as I smile right at my quarry crouched not more than a couple of feet away in the saddle of two branches. It resembles the innocent head of hair of a young brunette child, streaks of exposed wood, clean, pale, near it from where it has gnawed away the bark in its fits of temperament. Slowly, gracefully, I extend an open hand towards it with fingers relaxed and slightly spread. "Hello there you beautiful oyster," I whisper to it huskily, "I know you and your kind, you moonlit kitten. You pretty sea muffin, you sweet meat with your pride of fur. So pretty, so pretty," I coo, as I reach very gently forward and touch it. Lightly I begin stroking, employing just my fingertips. The montes veneris feels tense, dry. I continue this nerve-wracking procedure for several sustained minutes alternately whispering and whistling the soft plush hair sends a throb through me. I blink away sweat, I swallow and feel about delicately for the little pink knob. I find it. I commence my tensions there gently, gently, just with the soft pad of a fingertip. I feel the muscles begin to relax and then the first moisture. I tremble powerfully and lean close and slide a finger into the cleft. The lips turn immediately slick. I work away there, then back to the knob, feeling the spasms of response, my breath grows hectic. I grunt in labor and involuntary appreciation. My wrist is starting to ache (laughs). I wriggle up awkwardly another rungs so that I'm several feet well clear the ladder top. With a flutter of trepidation, swampy with desire, I slip my hand away as deathly as I'm able, so both right and left and grip the ladder. I bend forward. (dramatic music) "May I," I'm murmur in a thickened voice and my heart throbs through me and I lower my mouth. The old familiar taste is sweet, almost fruity, like melon and seawater. My tongue finds the little knob right away. Expert is Everett worries it. I maneuver about with firm fervent lingering strokes. (panting) Memories flood me, I plunge my whole face down, shoving my tongue deep into the sloppy cleft. I rub with my nose and shake with my cheeks and work my tongue to a fairly well and the object of my attentions bucks around under me. The ladder begins to sway and dip as the two of us go at it for all our worth up among the leaves and the branches under the gaze of the moon. Suddenly my balance goes and I burst away and hang on wildly as I swing outward and then treeward from the ladder, swiveling, pendulum. I throw back my goo blasted head and I laugh in a band and in intimacy up through the greenery, up at the blinking stars. I managed to stabilize myself at last against a branch and I give a clearing pull over my face with my hand. "Come on, you angry oceanic mouse," I whisper to it huskily, "Time to go home." I extend my dapper arm. It climbs slowly onto my wrist. It mounts waggling up my sleeve. I feel it's sopping heat through the material. It perches finally on top of my shoulder. As carefully as I can on wobbling legs, I start down laughing gently as my burden nozzles my neck. After several pauses along the way for rearranging, I step down at last onto the bed of the ladder truck and then finally into the street. The mayor's deputy's car rolls slowly towards us. Sometime later, the car turns into a street of brownstones in a different part of town. "And thank you again for all of us," the hatted figure calls quietly through the window as I mount the steps to a front door. The car pauses, then drives off into the night. I ring the doorbell. After a few moments, I hear hurrying footsteps. The door jerks open. The woman gapes at me. She cries out and in her motion covers her mouth with her hands. "Everything's fine," I reassure her, "Everything's fine." I extend my shoulder towards her. She reaches out with both hands and seizes the warm plump epaulet, I make a gesture for her not to concern herself at all with ceremony, she turns and hurries into the house. "Please come in, I'll just be a minute," she says. (mellow music) After closer to 30 minutes, she finally reappears, smoothing her dress over her thighs. She's tidied herself up nicely, but she's obviously still feeling great emotion. She comes part way into the room and then she halts. She lifts her hands, but at a loss drops them. "How can I ever thank you? (mellow music) And what can I get you to drink?" I shrug, I name something. She goes over to the sideboard and mixes two of the same. I take my glass from her. We sit down, we clink and sip. I keep my jacket still buttoned. There's a pause. Her gaze drifts down to a lap and she laughs suddenly, shaking her head, (laughs). She looks at me, her eyes sparkle. I grin back in labored pleasantness. I put my drink on the coffee table. I rub one hand with the other. "Please listen to me. I'm afraid I feel the need to say this," I tell her my eyes still fixed on the coffee table. "Please understand, I was very glad to be of help and I hope, I truly hope you know I had a very, very lovely time." I prod her drink coaster with two fingers, "But I'm still recovering you see from a very difficult situation, several years duration, and I'm still not home. I'm in no position right now to get involved." The woman grins back at me, a mix of strong emotions working her. "I understand," she says huskily. (somber music) And I stay a while longer as she talks about this and that. The tender babble of the lonely hearted, two lonely people together in a lonely room in the night, but I can only sip my drink and smile at her sweet voice and linger yearning in the lamplight, hopeless, loveless, heartless. Then it's time for me to go. We embrace. (somber music) "Goodbye," she says, softly, "Goodbye." (somber music) "Goodbye," I tell her, (somber music) I start up the street. The moon is still up. The night is cool, I turn up my jacket collar. I sniff my fingers for a moment and snort quietly and sigh deeply as I incline my head against the tide of memories and make my way along through the sleeping town. (train rumbling) (mellow music) I open the door to a train compartment. There's a girl inside. She glances up from a magazine. "Are any of these other seats taken?" I ask. She shakes her head. I close the door behind me and sit down. I look at her while she reads. I hear the rhythmic thumb of the train as it slips along. The sound grows slowly, more insistent, more intimate. I blink at the girl. She looks at me. I turn my head and stare hurriedly out the window. The thumping that swells in my ears is not from the train at all I realize. It's from that long vacant place, deep inside my chest. The girl is directly responsible. I try to remain as calm as possible, but how can I demonstrate to her in a captivating way my love for her at first sight I wonder? Suddenly a gigantic rosebush appears in the window and pushes its way in filling up the entire compartment. "For Christ's sake," the girl cries from somewhere under the leaves. "Help me, I'm choking under all these blossoms!" A hack and batter and punch at the tangled branches and greenery and pink petals. At last, I managed to force the rosebush out. I slammed the window on it. "I'm sorry," I protest breathlessly. "Are you all right?" I help her sit up. "I meant to give you an unusual gift of flowers, not suffocate you," I explained it, "I've been outta practice for a very long time." "That's very sweet of you," the girl says, "But you know, sometimes the gift of a single flower can be just as effective." "You're absolutely right," I agree, "Wait one minute." I hurry out into the corridor peering frantically about for flowers with predictable results. Then suddenly it comes to me, the dining car. I rush there and while the waiter's back is turned from a slim vase on a line covered cloth I filch a single carnation. I return to the compartment breathless, but triumphant. I present a single flower. The girl looks at me in fond amusement. "I think you're sweet," she says. I sit down beside her and I put my arm around her. We gaze out the window. A tear starts down my cheek. "What's wrong?" She whispers. I shake my head, "Nothing," I tell her. "I can see ahead in the future, that's all." "Well then why are you sad?" She asks. "Because first we'll be very happy," I say, "And then we'll be sad, that's just the way it will be for us." She nods somberly, "You're probably right," She says. "I am?" "I don't know," she laughs. "I've fallen in love with you you fool. Let's be together always." I take her in my arms and I kiss again and again her protesting mouth, her cheeks damp with my joyful tears as the train sways into a curve and straightens swaying the other way and rushes on. Outside through the window an early summer storm erupts raining rose petals over the greeny landscape.
