( dog barking ) ( woman vocalizing ) ( score playing ) ( typing ) Oh, good morning, Mr. Webb. Good morning, Ann. Mr. Webb is here. ( hangs up ) Why don't you go in? Thank you. ( door opens ) Hello, John. You all right? Couldn't be better. How you doing? Fair. We're about at the end of it, I think. Sign here, please. Probatin' a will can take forever. Thank you for your patience. Look, I know how complicated it can all be. How're the girls? They're all right. Trying to get me to come and live in Houston so they can keep an eye on me. ( chuckles ) You gonna do it? Oh, God knows, Gilbert, what I'm gonna do. One day, I'm gonna do one thing. The next day, it's changed. ( sighs ) Bessie and I were married 52 years. I'm lost without her, Gilbert. I really don't know what I'm gonna do. Hi. Good day, Mr. Webb. ( phone ringing faintly ) Use the one that they brought over last week. ( knocks ) Yes? Mr. Davis? Yes. I'm John Webb. Yes, sir, how can I help you? Uh, I'd like to talk to you about a loan. Yes, sir. Please, come in. Sit down. How much did you want to borrow? Oh, just enough to get me through to the fall when I can harvest my crops. Fill out these forms for me. Daddy? How much longer do we have to stay out here in this godforsaken place? Hush up, Jocelyn, and quit complaining. I wished I'd never come. Then why did you? Nobody forced you. ( static hisses ) ( rock music playing ) Jocelyn, turn that damn thing off. I've got a splitting headache now. ( music stops ) You want aspirin? I got some in my pickup. I've already had three. Didn't do me a bit of good. He always gets upset when he comes out here. Your daddy just gave his half of the land away when he sold it. How much did Granddaddy's tombstone cost? I don't know. I bet it cost 500 if it cost a penny. It's pretty, I'll say that. It's every bit as nice as Aunt Bessie's. Yes, it is. You know what I think? I still think they're gonna find oil out here. And because your daddy kept his share of the mineral rights, we're gonna all be rich. Oh, hush, Estelle. You're talking foolishness. Daddy? If you don't hush up, girl, I'm gonna come over there and slap you. I wanna go back now. Well, go on. Ain't no one stopping you. I can't walk seven miles into town. Well, then keep quiet until I'm ready to take you. Jocelyn, did you hear what your Aunt Estelle said? She said they're gonna find oil out here-- we're all gonna be rich. ( both chuckle ) I bet my life on it. I went to see a fortune-teller in Houston. She looked me right in the eye and she said, "Do you own some land?" "No, ma'am," I said, "I don't own anything, but my husband owns some mineral rights." "That's it," she said, "You don't let go of that. You are going to be rich." How rich? Oh, I don't know. She didn't say that. Just rich. Can I take ballet and tap dancing if we get rich? Ask your daddy. Daddy? What, honey? Can I take ballet and tap dancing if we get rich? Oh, I reckon. ( rock music playing ) Jocelyn, turn off that damn radio! ( music stops ) ( car approaching ) Well, look who's here. ( car door opens ) How're you doin'? Oh, pretty fair, Uncle John. How're you doing? Howdy. Hi. We's came out to look at Daddy's tombstone, Uncle John. Ah, I'm glad you did. Oh, hi, Estelle. Hi there. We sure appreciate you puttin' it up. We were hoping next year to do something about it. Things been a little tight for us both. Don't worry about it. Hi. How are you, Agnes? Children, did you know your grandfather and I grew up out here? Do you remember your grandfather? No, sir. No. They don't hardly-- maybe Jocelyn. Jocelyn, do you remember your grandfather? No, ma'am. ( all chuckle ) Well. Would you all come into the house for a spell? Not today, thank you. I can't anyway. I have to get on back to town. Oh. I think I'd better get back, too. Aunt Estelle, tell him about our getting rich. Are you getting rich? Uh, no, sir. It was just a joke. I told her that a fortune-teller told me that my husband was gonna get rich from oil, and since I knew that he and Gus Jr. had their daddy's mineral rights... Well, let's hope she was right and then we'll all be rich. ( all chuckle ) Yes, sir. Papa says you're rich now. Shut up, Gus III. Be quiet. Well... if your papa says that, he's wrong. I'm what you call "landpoor." I have trouble paying my taxes. Tell you the truth, I'd sell it all if I could. Huh. At least that's the way I feel today. Maybe tomorrow I'll feel differently. You remember Grey? My overseer out here all those years? Yes, sir, I do. Well, he's retired. Now he's talkin' of leavin'. Where's he goin'? Houston to live with his daughter. Seems like half the world's moving to Houston. I wish I was moving to Houston. That's enough out of you, Jocelyn. Daddy's got a headache. He's always gettin' headaches. Big deal. Better watch yourself, girl. She's at that age. You know, Mr. John-- smart aleck. Well, if you won't come into the house, I guess I'll be on my way. So long. Bye. Bye. Bye-bye, Uncle John. See you, Uncle John. So long. See you. ( sighs ) Boy, Gus III, I've got a good mind to strangle you. Why? Opening your big mouth about my headaches. John, come on in. Hi, Jack. Hey, guess what we're doing? What? Looking at pictures of Alaska. Oh. Would you like some iced tea, John? No, thank you. A beer? Nothing. Thank you. Will this be your first cruise, John? Yes. If I go. I haven't decided completely. Oh, I know how you feel. I almost called up Jack and Susan and said, "I just don't think I can go. I don't have the heart for it." But my children wouldn't hear of it. They think it would be good for me to get away. I keep wishing Clarence was here to go along. He never had a trip of any kind. You never did know Clarence well, did you, Mr. Webb? No, I'm sorry to say I didn't. I knew him to speak to, of course. When my wife and I joined the country club, I used to see him out on the golf course. Oh, he loved golf. If he had gone on this cruise, he would be wanting to play golf the minute he got to Alaska. I wonder, do they have golf courses in Alaska? I'm sure they do. You don't play golf, Mr. Webb? I-- call me John, please. John. Uh, no. I don't play golf. John's a farmer. Well, I know that. No, no, he's a farmer that farms. He just don't sit around in town and ride out every now and again and watch his hired help farm. Well, I used to anyway. I'm slowin' down these days. We're all slowing down. Well, I'm not slowing down. Don't you think I am. I'm just gettin' started good. ( all chuckle ) Why did you join the country club if you don't play golf? Well, to tell you the truth, it was the only place to go for a decent meal if you felt like eating out, which my wife did sometimes. Isn't it terrible? We have no restaurants here at all. McDonald's, Whataburger, Sonic. We have Taylor's. Oh, that's barbecue. I get so tired of barbecue. Miss Lillie-- Call me Lillie. If I'm gonna call you John, you have to call me Lillie. All right. You said the other day, you couldn't ever remember seein' my wife. I brought a picture of her. Oh, yes, I remember her now. Oh, such a pretty thing. Thank you. And just as sweet as she could be. Oh, I know she was. How long were you married? 52 years. Mmm. Clarence and I were married 40. Oh. I was 18 when I married him. How old were you and Bessie when you married, John? Uh, she was 20. I was 22. You met in college. That's right. At the university. ( soft tapping ) Uh, would you all like to have supper with me at the club? Oh, dear. Oh, no, we can't. Thank you. We're going to the Thompsons' for supper. Oh. I have a bridge game. I hear they have lots of bridge on the cruise. You play bridge, Mr. Webb? John. John. Uh, no. I never learned. Was your wife a bridge player? No. ( soft tapping ) Well, I-- I think I'll be getting on. I'll see you folks all later. So long, John. 'Night, Jack. Now, ask us another time. I'll do that. Bye-bye. I thought I heard a car. Hey. How you doin'? I'm all right. How are you, Mr. John? I'm pretty good. ( chickens clucking ) When are you leavin'? This week sometime. My girls are coming for me. How do you feel about it? I made my peace. Now, look, you don't like it, you come on right back here. I'll keep your house for you. Yes, sir. Things have changed, Mr. John. ( chuckles ) They have that. Well, that's what happens. Things change. Things change. I'll miss you, Grey. Yes, sir. I'll be out here all by myself. Everything's changed, Grey. Town's changed. County's changed. All the families we knew, black and white, are gone. We're the last. ( chuckles ) And now you're going. I didn't want to go, to tell you the truth. But I couldn't stand up to my daughters any longer. Your daughters have done well. I know you're proud of 'em. Yes, sir. They've done well. They both have good jobs. They both graduated from college. I tell 'em they don't know how it was when I was coming along. You didn't go to school till that cotton was picked. You left in time for planting. I don't think I went to school more than four months out the year. I know, I know. And you wanted to stay out there in the field, picking right along with us, but your daddy wouldn't let you. He made you go to school. He did that. ( phone ringing ) Yeah? Oh. Hello, baby. How's my girl? Good. How's your sister? No, I haven't talked to her today. How's Paul? You give him my regards. Wha-- I'm all right. Don't you worry about me. Well, I think I'll start planting my corn next week. Yeah, I know. I'm a little late. Well, I'll plant a little cotton-- very little this year. No, I haven't decided about going on the cruise yet. Have to decide soon, I guess. All right, honey. ( chuckles ) You go along. Good night. ( thunder crashing ) ( car approaches ) How are you, Mr. Webb? Pretty well! On your way to Houston, Grey? Yes, sir. You take good care of him, Lois. Yes, sir. I'm going to. Didn't you want to start planting on Monday? I wanted to, but this rain's got different plans. Can't argue with the rain. That's the truth. ( thunder booms ) Jocelyn, for God's sakes, turn that television down. ...and personal life, I've always felt that-- What'd you do that for? I said to turn it down. You can't mind me, then you don't watch television for a week. Go to hell. What'd you say, young lady? Nothing. She said go to hell. Shut up, Gus. Now stop it! Just stop it! Your father has a splittin' headache. Do you understand that? He is real sick with a headache. If this rain doesn't stop, I think I'm gonna slit my throat. ( knocks on door ) Oh, hi. Is this the Webb house? Yes. Is Mr. Webb in? Yes. May I see him? What's it about? I'm with the Big Oil Drilling Company. I'm trying to track down John Webb, Gus Webb Jr., and Carl Webb. Yes? I'd like to talk to Mr. Webb about an oil lease. Oh, uh, yes, sir. Just a minute. Won't you come in out of the rain? Thank you. Thank you. ( sighs ) Mm. Oh, thank you. Hi there. Hi. ( clears throat ) How do you like this rain? I don't like it. I don't like it at all. It's been three days-- no end in sight. I just drove by the river on my way over here. It's really high. All we need's a flood, huh? My husband will be in in a second. He was in bed with a headache. Oh, I'm sorry. Listen, I can come back another time. No, it's all right. My husband is a housepainter. He hasn't been able to work for three days. Well, if you can't work, you can't make any money. You can say that again. Mr. Webb. Yes, sir. Travis Floyd. Yes, sir. We've been out in the country looking for your father. My father. Yes, sir. My father's been dead for 10 years. Oh, I'm sorry. I thought-- I thought John Webb was your father. No, he's my uncle. My father was Gus Webb. He's Gus Webb Jr. I see. Thank you. Get up, bud. Well, uh, you know where I can find Mr. Webb? No, if he's not out in the country. That's where he lives. I've been out three days. I've called out there probably 10 times, but I don't get an answer. Maybe he's in Houston with his daughters. You know how to reach him in Houston? No. No, sir. I'm afraid I don't. Uh, do you know his daughters' names? Not their married names. Well, you know what? Forget it. That's okay. I'll find him some way. But I do need to talk to you. I understand you have, uh, interest in the mineral rights in the land he owns? Yes, sir. My company-- Whew! Hey. Hi! Hey, hey. Isn't this rain awful? I'll say. You don't know where Uncle John is, do you? No, why? Well, this man's looking for him. Travis Floyd. Oh, you're the man from the oil company. Yeah. Well, I'm Carl Webb. And this is my wife Estelle. Hi. I got the note you left me at the house. Why do you want my uncle? Actually, I want to talk to all of you, but your uncle, I suppose, is the essential one because he owns the land. But it does affect you, too. You both, I believe, have a share in the mineral rights. Yes, sir, 50%. Well, my company would like to make a lease with your uncle. And I hope he's willing. I don't know your uncle, but I understand he's a very reasonable man. Yes, sir. Then I want to make a deal with you boys. But my company insists I make a deal with your uncle first. ( knocks on door ) Hi. I almost drowned gettin' over here. Shepherd Drive is like a lake. Oh. I hope Daddy makes it in all right. I think it is so foolish, his living out there all alone. I think he should sell the farm. I know you do and I agree. But Paul says you can't just turn around and sell a farm today... with the economy the way it is. He has to at least try, talk to realtors. Well, talk to him when he comes in. How is Paul? I'm worried to death if you want to know. They have been letting men go right and left at his company. ( knocks on door ) Daddy. Hello, darling. Daddy. Hi, sweetheart. Are you soaked? No, I'm fine. You get your plantin' done? Ha. No. I did not. Daddy? Yes, honey? I don't mean to pry, but... just how are you financially? Well, now. I'm not about to go to the poorhouse tomorrow if that's what's worrying you. I know that, but sometimes Jacqueline and I do worry. Well, tell you the truth, I'm little strapped for cash right now. I had to go to the bank to borrow to see me through until the fall. He weren't very nice about it either. Some young fool, who I bet had never been near a farm in his life, began to give me advice on how to farm. ( chuckles ) Yesterday, I was ready to quit-- sell my machines, my cattle, my land. I even went to talk to some realtors about it. They weren't very encouraging. And I'm all alone out there now. Grey moved to Houston a few days ago. I really think you oughta think about moving here, too, Daddy. Maybe he feels he can't afford it, Grace Ann. I could afford it, I guess, if I sold everything. But something in me just hates to let go. I get to the startin' point every other day. I don't know. ( sighs ) I know, Daddy. Maybe if you just rent the place out for a year, see how it felt. No one'll rent farmland out here anymore. They can't afford to. If they don't make a crop, they've just lost a year's rent. You have anything saved? Very little. It's not fair, as hard as you and Mother worked all these years. Since when was anything fair? I'd ask you to stay here with me and Gerald... No. but we've only the two spare rooms. When the children come home from college-- Stay with me and Paul. No, no. I would never consider moving in with either one of you. Would you ever consider moving out there? Either of you? Both of you? I could fix up the old cook's house. Move in there. Or Grey's house. It would suit me fine. Oh, that wouldn't be very practical, now, would it, Daddy? I mean, Paul knows nothing about farming. And I doubt that Gerald does. Not a thing. Well, I know that land's gonna be valuable again someday. 10 years ago, I was offered $1,000 an acre. I remember. $150,000 for the house. I remember. And they were willing to pay me a fair price for all my machinery. I remember. Who was that? Oh, some Houston oil man. I forget his name. Delbert Lee. Oh. He's broke now. He's lost everything. His house in River Oaks, his farm. I'm sure Daddy knows that, Jacqueline. What did the realtors say was the fair market price now? I went to two of 'em. And? $400 an acre, tops. If I could find a buyer. $400 an acre? That would leave you-- 160. $160,000. Would that include the house? No. Not the house. But the barns, the tenant houses, everything else. It's all so depressing, isn't it? Oh, I don't think it's depressing at all. I mean, $160,000 would last Daddy quite a while. I wouldn't get $160,000, Jackie. Government would take 30% of it. And I owe the bank. Oh. Well, it is depressing, then. Well, I'm not gonna be depressed. I'm just gonna hang on and manage as best I can. I've always managed to get good help when I needed it. Life's a little complicated now, girls. ( chuckles ) Was it ever simple? I doubt it. I'm so depressed. Oh, come on, now, Jackie. It's not the end of the world, you know. I've still got my health. That's something. We have been having a really hard time of it, Daddy. I didn't want to worry you, but Paul is in constant fear of losing his job. They let 30 men go out of the firm last month. They've asked him to take a cut in pay, which he can't afford, but he's scared not to. ( Grace weeping ) Come on, Gracie. I miss Mama so much, Daddy. She always knew what to do. Oh, I miss her so much, Daddy. Our children are about to drive us crazy. College is costing us a fortune and they're not taking it seriously at all. They're both just hanging on. Gerald and I expect to hear they've been expelled any day. I'm sorry, honey. I didn't mean to trouble you with all our problems. I'm glad you told me. What else is a father for? I miss Mother, too, Daddy. I know you do. ( weeping continues ) Uncle John? Uncle John? Maybe he's sick in there or dead! Uncle John, it's me! Carl Webb! What can we do? Maybe we should break the door down or try and climb in a window. I'll leave a note. We don't hear from him soon, I'll find a way to get in. ( thunder booms ) ( Gus stammers ) I could kick myself for never getting his daughters' phone numbers. Why would you want their numbers? Stuck-up things, I never could stand them. Hello, Gilbert. John Webb. Uh, I've had an inquiry about an oil lease. I'd like to come in and talk to you about it. All right. Okay. Thank you. I'll call you back. They are interested in leasing your land, all right. What'll they offer? $60 an acre. That'd give you about $24,000. Well, that's not to be sneezed at, God knows. I think, if you're willing to play a little hardball, I can do better than that. Let me make a couple calls and don't say anything until you hear from me. All right. ( thunder crashes ) ( TV playing ) ( knocks on door ) Uncle John? Uncle John! Coming! ( broadcast continues ) ( loud knocks ) Just a minute. Hi. Come on in. Isn't this rain something? Whoo! Damn! I haven't been able to work for a week. I bet you haven't been able to plant. ( chuckles ) No. You been out of town? Yeah. I was in Houston visitin' my girls. See? That's what I figured. Well, I heard somewhere you'd gone on a cruise, but I said-- No. I was visitin' my girls in Houston. I was thinking of going on a cruise, but I decided not to. I really couldn't afford it. I guess it costs a lot of money, a cruise. A lot to me anyway. Come on in. Come in. Sit down. Well? How you boys been doin'? Pretty fair. Uncle John? Yes, sir? Did a Mr. Travis Floyd get in touch with you? Yes, he did. He left a note for me. I found it the same time I found yours. I told my lawyer to call him late this afternoon. And that was about an oil lease on your land here? That's right. You remember that, uh, Gus Jr. and I have half the mineral rights. I certainly do. Say, Uncle John? Yes, sir? Uh, he told me-- Who did? Travis Floyd. He told me he was willing to pay you $60 an acre. That's what he said. Yes, sir. Uh... are you gonna take it? Well, I don't know right at the moment. My lawyer thinks we should negotiate, play a little hardball, as he says. So I told him to go ahead. Yes, sir. Gilbert-- your lawyer Gilbert Jackson? That's right. He's a good lawyer. Heh. Everybody says. I think so. $60 an acre come to $24,000. Mm-hmm. He says we'll get the same for our share. $12,000 for me, $12,000 for Gus Jr. Gus Jr. hasn't been able to work all week 'cause of the rain. I'm sure. So how soon will it be before you know if you're gonna take the money from the oil company? Well, my lawyer-- I understand about lawyers, Uncle John-- excuse me-- of course, it's your land, but, ha ha, things been pretty rough for me, too. I should hate if anything happened and we didn't get the money. I know you need money, son. I know Gus Jr. needs money. And I can certainly use money. But my lawyer-- Who's your lawyer?! Gilbert. Oh, sure, sure, sure. I know that, I know that. If he can get them up to $80 an acre, that'd be that much more for you two. It wouldn't hurt my feelings any if you could get $80 an acre. I'm gonna put my cards on the table. I-- I owe everybody in town. I'm behind in my rent, my truck payments. It's supposed to rain the rest of this week, maybe next-- I understand, son. You need money. Not tomorrow, but today. That's about the size of it, sir. And they won't sign with us until they sign with you. 'Course, like I told Gus Jr., by the time the federal government sticks out its greedy hands for its share, we're not gonna wind up with no $12,000. We'll be lucky to have $10,000. I know that's the truth. Money isn't everything, of course. I saw a lady on TV won a million dollars on the lottery the other day. And she said the responsibility of all that money just about drove her crazy. People callin' her on the phone, day and night, asking for handouts. She said she had a good mind to give it all back. Shoot. You wouldn't catch me giving up a million dollars. No many how many people worried me. She said the federal government's gonna end up with more than half of it. I expect that's about right. Mm-hmm. ( clears throat ) How're you gettin' on out here by yourself, Uncle John? Oh, I'm gettin' on all right. I bet it gets kinda lonely for you now, though. It gets lonesome. Well, I guess, uh, we'd better be gettin' on back to town, Gus Jr. Yeah, I reckon so. ( phone ringing ) Excuse me. Yes, sir. We'd appreciate hearing about what you're doing, Uncle John, as soon as you know. I'll keep in touch. Hey, you think it'll be tomorrow? Could be. Excuse me. Yes, sir. Oh, man, I hope so. ( huffs ) What do you think? You think it'll be tomorrow? God knows, Gus Jr. God knows. They told me this afternoon, at the bank, they'd advance me some money as soon as all the papers are signed. ( thunder crashing ) Do you think his lawyer could get more money from Travis Floyd? God knows. You said you liked his lawyer. I'm just saying that. I don't like him at all. Stuck-up old know-it-all, in my opinion. That was my lawyer. He's got them up to $80 an acre. Ooh. And he says if I'm patient, he thinks he can get $100 an acre, maybe $125. ( whistles ) Golly. I see. How long will all this going back and forth take? Oh, I don't know. A week maybe. Maybe a month. A month. ( sighs ) Well, you know-- look, I don't know how you feel, Carl, but I swear, if it was me, which I know it ain't, I'd take the $80 an acre. That'd come to $32,000. You see, Uncle John-- I know, I know. You need money. Oh, bad, and real soon. Well, let me see what I can do. Yes, sir. Well, let's, uh-- let's get on back, Gus Jr. Well, I'm ready. I just would like to say one last thing. Like the old fella said, "A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush." Good night, Uncle John. Good night, boys. Good night, Uncle John. Good night. ( phone rings ) ( TV chattering ) ( vacuum humming ) ( vacuum stops ) Did you see your uncle? Yes. And? And what? Has he talked to Mr. Floyd? Yes. What did you do that for? Because I don't want the damn thing on. Do you mind? Yes, I mind. Be quiet, Jocelyn. Well, what did your Uncle John have to say? He got a damn lawyer talkin' to the oil people trying to squeeze money out of the damn oil company. I thought you said we were gonna get $12,000. Will you shut your damn mouth? And nobody said a damn thing about $12,000. Mama did. Well, what the hell, Agnes? Are you going around telling people we're getting $12,000? I didn't say we were going to. I said we might. Yes, you did, too. You said-- Don't tell me what I said, young lady! Go to hell. You watch your tongue, young lady, or I'll get your daddy to whip you. Now, I hope you are satisfied, Little Miss Priss. He's gonna have one of his headaches again. ( knocks on door ) Who's there? Yeah, it's Travis Floyd. I'm gonna tell him what a mean witch you are-- You open your mouth to Travis Floyd, and I'll kill you. Ma? What? Can we turn on the television now? No. Oh, hello, Mr. Floyd. What a surprise. Hi. Good evening. I'll go call Gus Jr. Come on in. Thank you. ( TV chattering ) Hello, kids. Hi. What are you watching? Television. I can see it's television. But what are you watching on television? I don't know. I'm just watching. You don't know what you're watching? No. Don't you care? No. You watch television? Sometimes. You have kids? Yep. I have a little boy and a little girl about your age. Do they watch television? Too much, I'm afraid. ( TV clicks ) Oh, Ma. I want you children to go to your room. Daddy and I have to visit with Mr. Floyd. I don't want to go to my room. I don't neither. Then if you stay, don't open your mouth, either of you. How're you folks tonight? Oh, pretty fair. How you doin'? I'm all right. I'm all right. Sick of this rain. ( chuckles ) Yeah, you could say that again. Listen, my coming over here, I guess, is not exactly ethical. Ordinarily, I wouldn't do it, but I like you folks. And I like Carl and his wife. What was her name? Estelle. Ah, Estelle. How could I forget? Well, they may come over later. I left a note at their house, letting 'em know I was coming over. Oh, they're never home, are they, Gus Jr.? No. You know where they are? Oh, they could be a thousand places. Is there a bingo game tonight? Because if there is-- wait a minute. I know where they are. I heard Estelle say she was gonna get Carl to drive her into Houston to see that fortune-teller again. See, the day before you come to see us, she had gone into Houston to see a fortune-teller. And she told Estelle that she and Carl were gonna be rich from oil. Hmm. That's interesting. She was all excited when we heard from you about the lease. They didn't go into Houston. Carl was with me when we went to see Uncle John. Oh, I forgot that. Hey. Hello, folks. Hello, everybody. Come on in. Oh, isn't this rain terrible? Don't even talk about it. I told Mr. Floyd-- Please call me Travis. All right, Travis. I said I bet you've gone into Houston to see the fortune-teller, but then Gus Jr. said you couldn't have, because he was with Carl this afternoon. We were going in tonight, but Carl didn't want to drive all the way into Houston unless he was sure that fortune-teller was gonna be there. I called four times, but all I got was an answering machine-- how are you, Mr. Floyd? Fine. Call me Travis, please. All right. Mr. Travis. No "mister." Just Travis. Sorry. Travis. I was just about to explain why I was here when you all came in, saying it's not exactly ethical, me being over here. Why isn't it? Let the man finish what he has to say, Estelle. I'm sorry, Carl. I'm sorry, Mr. Travis. Travis. Call him Travis. Sorry. Travis. I'm here stretching things a bit 'cause I like you. Well, we like you, too, don't we, Carl? Didn't I-- For God's sake, let the man finish what he has to say, Estelle. Sorry, Carl. Go on, please, Travis. Well, what I was gonna say was I sense from what you told me that you could use a little cash right now. Boy, that's the truth. And which one of us can't? When you gonna give Daddy the $12,000? Shut up. Just shut right up. Is your uncle a rich man? Well, he is to me with all that land, but he says he's not. He's always talking poor man. How much influence do you have with him? Not a hell of a lot. Why? Well, I hate to see greed kill your deal. I don't know if you know this or not, and you can't tell anybody I told you, but from what I understand, your uncle's under the influence of a very shrewd lawyer. ( groans ) We know all about that. That's no news to us. And we all know the type. He thinks oil companies are made of money, which they are not, and he's trying to gouge the company with, to me, most unreasonable demands. I'm afraid, very much afraid, that if he keeps asking the company for more and more, they're just gonna say, "Forget it." I mean "forget it" forget it. You understand? I certainly do. You understand my point, Gus Jr.? Yes, I'm afraid I do. Well, what is the point? The point is, little lady, you might end up with nothing, zilch, zero. All because of one lawyer's greed. Uh, excuse me. I'm sick to my stomach. It's these headaches he has from time to time. Huh. Sick headaches. He ends up nauseous. Listen, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to unduly upset anyone here, but I felt like I needed to be honest and aboveboard with you people. We appreciate that, sir. We certainly do. Carl, you need to drive out to the country and see your Uncle John right away. You need to tell him everything this gentleman has said. No, no, no. You can't ever say that this came from me. I could get in a lot of trouble. Yes, sir. Do I have your word you won't divulge I told you any of this? Yes, sir. You have my word. Yes, sir. Thank you. ( knocks on door ) Oh, hello, Mr. Webb. Hello, Uncle John. Hello, son. Hi, Estelle. Hi there. Hi. Travis Floyd with Big Oil Drilling Company. Oh, yes. You're the fellow I spoke to on the phone. Yes, sir. Am I interrupting a party or something? No. No, sir. We was just having a little visit. Ah. Where's Gus Jr.? Oh, he's a little under the weather. Oh, I'm sorry. Mr. Floyd. Yes, sir. I guess we're in business together. How's that, sir? My lawyer just spoke to your lawyers and we've agreed to sign the lease. They're preparing the papers now. They'll be ready in the morning. I just drove out to tell you folks. Gus Jr.! Gus Jr.! Well, congratulations. Thank you. We gonna get the $12,000 now, Mama? Be quiet, Gus III. Have you boys all signed with Mr.... Travis. Travis Floyd. Sorry. Have you all signed with Mr. Floyd yet? We have a verbal understanding. I believe we agreed to $60 an acre. Uh, no, sir, I don't think we agreed on that. Well, then I certainly misunderstood. It was my opinion you felt it was a very good offer. Well, you see, sir, our uncle here is getting $80 an acre. But your uncle owns the land. You don't own the land. Excuse me, but I'm gettin' $100 an acre. Excuse me, sir. It's understood, sir, what you're getting, but you own the land. Not according to my lawyer. According to my lawyer-- Gilbert Jackson? That's right. Well, I have to tell you it's been my experience he has a very misguided idea about oil companies. You are aware, of course, what it will cost my company to drill this well. The cost, I want you to know-- Excuse me. Let me just tell my nephews what my lawyer said to me. He said they had a right to ask for whatever they wanted. And I'm saying my company has a right to say no. So I warn you both against getting any exaggerated ideas. Excuse me. Excuse me. ( sighs ) Look, I wanna get this over with. I like you folks. I'm very sympathetic with your situation. If your uncle is indeed being given lease money of $100 an acre, I will take it upon myself-- it may cost me my job-- but I'll take it upon myself to get you the same. So that means I'll get $20,000, and Gus Jr. gets $20,000? Exactly. Oh, my God. Ha ha! I bet that headache's gonna be cured mighty fast now. We're gonna all be rich now? No, son. Nobody's gonna be rich. Unless we strike oil. We could be rich then, couldn't we, Mr. Travis? Well, let's put it this way: I wouldn't mind having your share of the well if you struck oil. Do you think they will strike oil? Well, never know about that. Well, but what's your feeling? I think you have an excellent chance. No company's gonna spend half a million dollars on a well if they didn't expect oil to be there. It was tried once before, you know. They found nothing. I know, but the equipment's far more sophisticated these days. Well, uh, when will you start drilling? Soon as we put the contracts behind us and the rain stops. Could be a month till the rain stops. Damn rain! ( groans ) Oh, boy. You still got a headache, Daddy? Be quiet, Gus III. You look pale as a ghost, Gus Jr. He'll be all right. Give him time. Hi, Gus Jr. Hello, sir. How d'you like our news, huh? Well, it couldn't be better. You gonna have $20,000. And I'm gonna have $20,000! Yee-ha! Whoo! Ain't that something? Boy, that fortune-teller sure knew what she was talkin' about. ( all laugh ) ( workers chattering ) Yee-ha! ( engine starts ) Well, bless my soul. This is a surprise. He was about to drive me crazy, Mr. John. Hello, Lois. He wouldn't let me rest until I brought him out here for a visit. Glad to see you, Grey. Real good to see you, too. I got to visit a sick auntie in Boonville, Mr. John. Is it all right if Daddy stays a while and visits with you? It sure is. I'll see you in a while, Daddy. Take your time. Mr. John, what's going on out there? They're trying for oil. My goodness. You could be a rich man. That's what they say. ( chuckles ) All right. Come on up to the house. How are you, Grey? Tolerable. How do you like Houston? It's all right, I guess. Who's working for you? Lou Sherman's boy and a Mexican named Luis Sanchez. You know 'em? I know the Sherman boy. Herbert? That's the one. I don't know the Mexican. Eh... I was out there workin' with 'em a little earlier, but I can't go the way I used to. No, sir. I'll go out later and join them when it's a little cooler. What are you planting? Corn. Planted five acres of cotton for old times' sake. The rain we had just stopped in time. It was getting too late for planting. How do you like Houston? It's all right. I asked you that before, didn't I? Yes, sir. ( chuckles ) I may be moving into your old house. Is that so? Paul, Jackie's husband, lost his job. They got over their heads in debt. They're losing their house in Houston, their car, just about everything. Jackie's living here with me now. Paul goes back and forth to Houston. And the kids, of course, will be here for some part of the summer, so I'm turning this house over to them. Yes, sir. Does Lois have a house in Houston? No. She has an apartment. I got my own room, though. And things is high in Houston, Mr. John. She pays $700 a month for that apartment. Go on. She do, too. $700 a month. $700 a month. Yes, sir. ( chuckles ) That's a new tractor. Yes. I needed it bad. I was afraid the old one wouldn't see me through the winter. So when I got the lease money, I bought a new tractor, went down to the bank, paid off what I owed 'em, so I'm in the clear again. I wonder how many notes I've paid off down at that bank in my lifetime. But I can't complain. My head's still above water. You all right for money, Grey? Oh, I gets by. I got my pension from the government. My girls give me a little something now. That about does me. I got the insurance to bury me and that's all I need. Is anybody staying in those other tenant houses? The Mexican asked me if he could bring his family out here and stay in one while he worked here. He says the rents in Harrison have gone sky-high, too. I forget what he pays, but it seemed like an awful lot to me. Of course, not as high as it is in Houston. Nothing as high as Houston. What about that other tenant house? Oh, it's empty. Yes, sir. Mr. John? Mm-hmm? I don't like Houston. I don't know nobody in Houston. My girls are nice to me, of course, but they're at work all day and I just sit in the apartment looking out the window. They say I could watch the TV. I don't like the TV. Now, could I stay in that other tenant house if I come back here to live? You don't have to stay in that other tenant house. You can go back to your old house. I'll move into the cook's house. Oh, no, sir. I can fix up that other tenant house. No, no, no, no. I won't hear of it. You should have your own house back. Yes, sir. Thank you. You reckon they gonna strike oil? God knows. Huh. ( car horn honks ) Well. Look who's here, Grey. Hello. Surprised to see us? I sure am. Hello, Grey. You remember my husband Gerald, Grey? Hello, Grey. My children Hector and Mary Louise. Yes, ma'am, I remember them all. Children sure have grown. They have at that, though they're not worth killing, either one of 'em. Come on, Gracie. Well, they're not. They both flunked out of college, Grey. Well... Grey has two daughters who took advantage of an education. They both have fine jobs in Houston. What is it they do, Grey? I forget. One of 'em is a pharmacist at a drugstore. The other one teaches at Southern Baptist University. Oh, and they both had to work like dogs to put themselves through college. Neither of 'em had 1/10 of your advantages. Come on, Gracie. Well, I get so mad when I think about it, all the money we spent on them just to flunk out. You're spoiled rotten, both of you. I tell you one thing: you're both gonna get jobs. I don't care how minimal they are, you are going to work. You don't shut up, I am going back to Houston right this minute. Let's all please change the subject. We passed the old Thorne place on the way over here. It was burned down. When did that happen? While I was visiting you in Houston. It was empty, you know. Had been for about five years. They say they were using it as a crack house. Oh, my God, Daddy. Don't tell me there's crack out here in the country. Yes, ma'am. Full of it. Out here in the country? In the country and Houston, too. Well, I know about Houston. They have everything in Houston. What about Harrison? Full of it. Hush. Full of it. Ain't that right, Mr. John? That's what they tell me. Well... that's one thing I have to be grateful for. At least you two don't fool with it. How do you know we don't? Well, I guess I don't know. I can only hope and pray. We drove out to see how the oil well was coming along. It's coming on pretty well, I guess. They started drillin' a couple days ago. How about that? Bet you'd like to come out and see all that excitement, huh, Mary Louise? It's not so excitin' now. Not like it was in the old days when I was a boy. It's all scientific now. They've got instruments that tell you everything. In the old days, when they struck oil, it would just come gushing up out of the earth. Flooded everything till they got the well capped. I wish I could've seen that. I bet that was a sight, huh, Mary Louise? ( sighs ) Where's my sister? She's in town getting her hair done. Where you goin', hon? Nowhere. Just going for a walk. She's gonna look for a crack house. Come on, Hector. That's so funny. Kids, let's go on down, see how that oil well's coming along. You gonna come, Grace Ann? No, I think I'll just stay here and visit with Daddy for a while. C'mon, kids. No, you know, I don't wanna go. You guys go. Come on. We'll just stay a little while. You might find it interesting. Go on with them, Mary Louise. Don't tell me what to do. Well, somebody has to tell you something. Come on, Grace Ann. Let's go, Mary Louise. Would you please tell her to get off my back? ( huffs ) Gerald lets the two of them walk all over him. I guess... I suppose I am a little rough on them, but it's just that I worry so. They have absolutely no motivation. They're still young. Think there's any chance they might strike oil? How would I know that, honey? ( chuckles ) ( workers chattering ) ( loud rumbling ) You know your mother loves you both very much. And she's right, of course. This is a very competitive time we're living in. If you don't have an education, you don't stand a chance. I hate school. I hate school, too. I know. I never liked it so much myself, but you have to go and get a degree in order to get certain things in this life-- a good job, for instance, a job that will provide certain things for you that you just now take for granted. Daddy, look, can we just change the subject, please? Okay, but promise me you'll think about what I've told you. And let me say one more time very clearly: if you want to make any kind of a living, you need in this day and age an education. I only wish now I'd taken college more seriously when I was your age. You see, I want to help you both avoid the kind of mistakes I feel I've made in my life. And I know your mother's trying to do the same thing. If they strike oil, will Grandpa be rich? He'll have plenty. But the days of great oil fortunes are gone, I'm afraid, at least here in America. Well, are we gonna get a share? Yeah, Dad, will we? I suppose, in time. I heard Mom and Aunt Jackie talking and Mama said that if he struck oil, she was gonna ask him to give Aunt Jackie her share of the money right away and not wait until he died. And then Aunt Jackie said that she was gonna ask him to give Mama her money right away, too. Then Mama said that you were worried about losing your job. No, I'm not, really. Of course, there's always a chance you can get eased out when you get my age. I think it's your mother that worries 'cause your Uncle Paul has lost his job. Mama worries about everything. Isn't this excitin'? See the Texas flag up there? Hi. Howdy. Hi. Can I help you folks? No, we're just watching. Uh-huh. I see. You folks from around here? No, we're from Houston. Houston? Yes, sir. Just visiting? Yes, sir. May I ask who you're visiting? My father-in-law. Your father-in-law? ( clears throat ) Well, would I know him? I don't know. Well, what's his name? John Webb. This is his land. Ha ha. Well, my goodness, what a small world. I'm his nephew. Oh. Folks, come over here and meet some of your kinfolks. Which one of them girls are you married to? Grace Ann. Uh-huh. Folks, this is Grace Ann's husband. Hi, I'm Gerald. This is our son Hector, our daughter Mary Louise. How do you do? I'm Carl. This is my wife Estelle. This is my son Timothy. Nice to meet you. This is my brother Gus Jr. and his wife Agnes. This is his daughter Jocelyn, named after our mother. And this is his son Gus III. And this is his daughter Little Agnes. I have another son named for me. We call him Little Carl, although he's bigger than I am. He couldn't get off work this weekend. Timothy here works in Austin. And his brother works in San Antonio. Shoot, we couldn't get 'em out here before, but once they heard that the well was going up, they can't stay away. Yeah. My wife Estelle went to a fortune-teller just the day before all this excitement began to happen and she told her she'd be rich. Ooh! Oh, and she was just darlin' about it, too, you know? She said our whole lives were gonna change. I'm real disappointed, though. I had wanted to go back down there and tell her what's happened, but she's moved and left no forwarding address. Isn't this all exciting? Well, where is Grace Ann? She's up at the house. ( radio blasting ) Don't start that noise, Jocelyn. ( radio turns off ) Jocelyn can't live without the radio or the TV on. Yeah. Do you get out to the country often? Every once in a while. We will have half the royalties, you know. You'll have half of nothing. Me and Gus Jr. will be the ones with the half. Well, Mr. Smarty, half of what you have belongs to your wife. Who says so? Estelle, make him behave. Now, Carl, you behave yourself. He's just a tease, Gerald. I warn you. ( ringing bell ) My Lord, what's that? I hope the house isn't on fire. C'mon, Gus Jr. Carl, you'd better take the car. Oh, he'll have a heart attack running that way. What is it, Grey? Mr. John. He's had a spell of some kind. Oh, my God. Oh, Gerald, we had to get Daddy into the house. He almost fainted. I did not almost faint, Grace Ann. You did, too. You scared me to death. Come on, now. Gerald and I are gonna take you into Harrison. I'm not goin' anywhere. All right, then, I will call a doctor to come out here. You'll never get anyone to come out here. Don't you dare get up! I'm gettin' up. I feel just fine. I swear I will never breathe an easy breath knowing you are out here all by yourself. I'm not all by myself. Jackie's here. Well, she won't be here forever. She will leave as soon as Paul gets a job. Yeah. Hello, Carl, Gus Jr. Hi, Grace Ann. Hello, Grace Ann. What's all the excitement? Hello, Paul. Hello, Paul. I'm Carl, Uncle John's nephew. This is my brother Gus Jr. Nice to know you. I'm Jacqueline's husband. Daddy had a sinking spell. For about half a second. Now will you please change the subject? Change the subject, Grace Ann. Where is Jacqueline? She went into Harrison to get her hair done. Hello, Gus Jr. Hello, Carl. Hello, Uncle John. Uncle John. Did your wives and children come with you? Yes, sir. Yeah, you can't keep 'em away. My God, they're almost driving me crazy. Every five minutes, they say, "Daddy, let's go out and see about the well." They already started drilling. I know. They say they might have something by next week. Is that so? That's what they told me. Unless something unforeseen turns up. That's what they told me, too. We'll be out at the well for the next hour or so, Uncle John, if you need anything. Thank you, Carl. Hope you feel better. Nice seeing you folks. Nice to have seen you. I almost didn't recognize them. What is it that they do? Gus Jr. paints houses. Carl does a little bit of everything. Jack-of-all-trades, master of none. That's about it. Do you have your planting done? Just about. It should be all done by tomorrow if the weather holds out. ( sighs ) Grace Ann, will you all stay for supper? We could drive over to the country club. No, sir, we can't stay. We have to get on home. Oh. Now, you take care of yourself. Yes, ma'am. Getting hungry? I can always eat. Jackie's a good cook. Oh, I know she is. Her mother was a good cook, too. Yeah. She certainly was. I walked over to the graveyard a while ago. I hadn't seen her tombstone before. It looks very nice. I think so. You know, I can hardly believe that she's not in that kitchen right now helping Jackie. Sometimes I think, quite suddenly, "Where is she? In the next room?" She was a wonderful woman. I loved her a lot. I know you did. And she loved you. I know that. I take comfort from that. Paul. Yes, sir? How are you fixed for money? Well, sir... Gerald tell you I borrowed money from him? No. Grace Ann told me. Don't tell Jackie, will you, please? It'd worry her to death. How much did you borrow? Well, sir, I-- Don't be ashamed, son. I've been in tight squeezes myself. I know what it means. Yes, sir. I borrowed $200. How long'll that last you? Not very long, I'm afraid. Of course, I may get a job any day now. I have to believe that, you know, else I'd go crazy. Well... I got a little extra money I can spare now. That lease money helped me get out of debt, bought us a new tractor for the farm. And I expect to make a crop this year, too, so you see, I'm ahead of the game for a while. ( chuckles ) I'm gonna write you out a check for $2,000. No. I couldn't take that much from you. I wouldn't be able to pay it back. You'll get a job. You'll pay me back. Not with the kinda jobs I'm being set up for. I'll be lucky if I could-- if you could loan me $200, that would see me through to the end of the month. And it's something I feel I could pay you back in time. Sure. Jackie thinks that we should live out here and I'd work on the farm. She said you asked us. I did. And I thank you, but, uh... I know nothing about farming. Well, it's mostly machines now, you know. There's nothing too strenuous about it. Long hours, of course. The spring, the summer, the fall. But if you can drive a car, you can drive a tractor. Maybe I will try. Maybe I should. Well, you can start any time you want. It's just too disappointing, you know, the kind of jobs being offered in Houston. I don't see how people are making it on the kind of salaries I'm told about. ( worker chattering ) Of course, if I had it to do all over again, I wouldn't do the extravagant things I did. We were foolish. We both realize that now. Supper's ready. Good. Paul, are you coming? No, I'm, uh, not hungry. You-- you have to eat. You have to eat. You all go on in, then. I'll be in in a little and have a cup of coffee. You will not. You will come in and eat your supper. Jackie, I'm not coming in now, so don't keep after me for it. Come on, Jackie. Leave him alone. ( music playing ) ( workers chattering ) All of us, too. Cheese! Stand next to me. Cheese! ( knocks ) Jacqueline? Can Little Agnes come in and get a drink of water? Sure, honey. Go on in and help yourself. Thank you. Agnes, come on in. How does your husband like farming? All right, I think. How do you like living out here? All right. To tell you the truth, I couldn't take living out here in the middle of nowhere. Hmm. It's too lonesome. Gus Jr.'s always complaining because his daddy sold his half of the farm so cheaply to your father. "Stop complaining," I tell him. What if you owned it? Who would farm it? Mmm. ( giggles ) They couldn't live out here. Me either. Or my children. God knows. They'd go crazy. ( laughs ) Nothing to do. Gus Jr.'s a housepainter when he gets the work, but it's awful slow now. We've had such a rainy winter. And everybody's short of money. Of course, our share of the oil lease helped out a lot, but that's about gone. We had to buy a car. The one we had, we'd driven for eight years. Got it secondhand then, so it was just a wreck. Afraid it was gonna die out one day on the road and never start again. Thank your cousin Jacqueline. Thank you, Cousin Jacqueline. You're very welcome. Gus Jr. says you have two sons. Yes. Do they live in Houston? No. One of them lives in St. Louis. He sells insurance. The other one lives in Pittsburgh. He's, uh, between jobs right now. Did they go to college? Yes. University of Houston. That's nice. C'mon, Little Agnes. Let's go. See you later, Jacqueline. Bye. Bye. Hello, Mr. John. How're you gettin' on? Hello, Sarah. I brought these flowers for Miss Bessie's grave. Oh, thank you. I come here every week. I know you do. Sit down. These are sweet peas. I know. They're lovely. Yeah, she loved sweet peas. She could never grow sweet peas in her yard. ( chuckles ) Remember she'd say, "Sarah, how come you can grow 'em and I can't?" I know. Jacqueline and her husband staying with you now? Yep. How's her husband like farming? Oh, he's a quiet sort of fellow. He doesn't talk much. I guess he likes it all right. Jackie doing the cooking? Yep. A shame I'm so old or I'd be up there cookin'. I been with you 30 years, you know. ( chuckles ) I know. Yes, sir. I was sittin' there on my porch. Man comes up, says, "Guess what? Miss Bessie died." I said, "Hush up." "She died," he said, "She died." ( weeping ) I miss her, Sarah. I miss her so much. Don't cry, Mr. John. Don't cry. I know you do. You a sweet man. I pray for you every day. Every day. Thank you. I pray for Miss Bessie, too. Thank you. You think they gonna find oil on your land? I wouldn't know about that, Sarah. Say, you'll be a very rich man if they do. Maybe so. You remember how I used to sing in the kitchen while I was working? And Miss Bessie, she'd call me into the parlor. She'd be at her piano. She'd play and I'd sing. I remember. Most every day, she'd do that. It was early spring when I came to work for you all. Jacqueline and Grace Ann were going to Harrison School. Mm-hmm. And Miss Bessie, she drove 'em there every day. The roads weren't paved then. They were all gravelly. Sometimes when it rained, she couldn't drive 'em to town. So she'd teach 'em their lesson out on your gallery. They'd just sit there, the rain just coming down. ( TV blaring ) Hey, Carl just called. He's out at the field and he said we'd better get out there. They tell him they think they're onto something. Hey, let's go. Oh, my God. I'm so excited, I'm trembling. Are we rich, Mama? Not yet, honey. We'll soon know. Come on, Jocelyn. Come on, Little Agnes. Let's hurry. We don't want to miss the excitement. I don't wanna go. What?! I don't wanna go. I'm sick of going out there and getting bitten up by mosquitoes. I wanna stay and watch television. Well, of all the-- Just let her stay. Come on, let's go. I wanna stay, too. I wanna watch television. You make me sick, both of you. I'm sorry the day that damn thing was invented. Come on, Agnes! All right! At least there's one of you that's interested in what's happening to this family. Oh God, not rain again! Thank you. What's happening? What's wrong? We've had a disappointment, I'm afraid. They brought up saltwater. There's no oil. ( Estelle whimpers ) Shut it down. Shut it down. All right. Kill it. Well, maybe they can go deeper! I heard many a time-- No. They've gone as far as they can go. There is no oil. That's it. Well, I'm a little tired. I'm gonna go along on back to the house. So long, everybody. Bye-bye, Uncle John. Good-bye. Say good-bye to your great Uncle John. Good-bye, Great Uncle John. Good-bye, son. I'll come with you, Daddy. Good-bye, everybody. Bye. Paul, are you coming? Good-bye. Bye. ( pounding ) ( workers chattering ) ( Gus III grunts ) Come on, Estelle. The world isn't coming to an end. It has, too. No, it hasn't. I told Estelle she shouldn't get her hopes up so high, but she wouldn't listen to me. We all had high hopes. I didn't. Oh, you did, too. I did not! 'Cause I knew better! I mean, why would I hope for anything? Nobody ever give me anything in my life. That's not true, Gus Jr. You got 20,000 just a month ago. Oh, big deal! Big deal! And where is it?! It's spent! After the government took its share and I bought a car and I got the children's teeth fixed and I paid the back rent on the house, what do I have now? Nothing! You have something left. Yeah, maybe. $1,000?! Well, that's something, isn't it? That's more than we've ever had before. Come on. We'd better go call the boys. I told 'em I'd let 'em know as soon as we knew. Okay. How'd Uncle John take it? He didn't say a word. You know how he is. He just listened to the men when they explained about saltwater. Of course, he doesn't have to worry. He owns all this land. ( laughs ) Whenever he needs money, he can just sell off a piece of land! Yeah. ( laughs ) Come on, Estelle. Let's go home, honey. Okay. I'm gonna miss coming out here. It ain't the same now. It's gonna be so lonely now. Nothing to do. God Almighty, Estelle, now stop it. Just cut it out, will you? ( choked ) I'm sorry, Carl. I'm just so disappointed. I had a lot of plans. I know I shouldn't, but I had a lot of plans. What kind of plans, Estelle? Oh, don't get her started on that, Agnes. We'll be here all night. No, now, come on. Come on, now. I'm-a go without you. I could cry, too. Well, don't start! ( weeping ) God's sake, don't start. Cut it out. I said cut it out, woman. Cut it out. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. I had plans, too. Estelle wasn't the only one. You son of a bitch. Son of a bitch! Son of a bitch! I guess we should call Grace Ann and tell her. Well, the lease money was a help to me anyway. Got me out of debt. Got us a new tractor. But I have to tell you children I'm disappointed in spite of myself. I had my own fantasies of what would happen if we found oil. ( chuckles ) Would you have left the farm then? One day I would. One day I wouldn't. ( chuckles ) One day I'd build houses out here for you and the children, so you could all come out and visit whenever you wanted. One day I... hired an overseer to take care of the farm and I took that trip to Alaska that I couldn't afford before. I was gonna divide the money between the three of us. I would keep a third, you and Paul would have a third, Grace Ann/Gerald a third, and we'd all be rich and happy for the rest of our lives. ( laughs ) Only it didn't quite work out that way. How can I help you, children? Paul, I know you're not happy here. I know farming doesn't really interest you. Jackie, how could I help you and your boy so far away? I want to help you. I know, Daddy. There was a time, you know, when a farm like this could take care of several families. I'd gladly turn it over to you and Paul, Grace Ann and Gerald. I-- I'm ready to quit. Daddy... Paul has been offered a job managing an apartment complex in Houston. It provides an apartment for us as part of the salary. If Paul accepts it, we'll have to leave in a week. Well, I'll miss you both. But I understand. We'll be in touch. You call us. I will. ( car door opens, closes ) ( engine starts ) ( footsteps ) Hello, Grey. Come on up on the porch and visit. You gonna make a crop this year? Heh. How would I know that, Grey? That's the truth. Nobody can tell that. One year you make a crop, and one year you don't. I have to make a crop, Grey. I have no money left. You'll get along. Ah. You always have. Jackie go on back to Houston? Yep. Her husband go back, too? Yep. They didn't last long. No. They didn't take to farming. Nope. They gonna leave that oil rig standing? Oh, they'll take it down pretty soon. They said they found saltwater instead of oil. That's what they said. How you gentlemen this evening? Hello, Sarah. Come sit and visit. I brought you some cake, Mr. John. Well, now... thank you. I'm sure I'll enjoy it. Angel food. Used to be your favorite. Still is. Mmm. Mmm. Delicious. Have some, Grey. Go on, go on, go on. Sarah is a cook. Always has been. ♪ Shall we ♪ Gather at the river ♪ Where bright angels' feet ♪ Have trod? That's the song Miss Bessie liked me to sing best of all. I'd be in the kitchen singing. She'd call out, "Sarah, come out here and sing with me while I play." And I'd come out and she'd play the piano. And I'd sing. It's so quiet. My God. It's so quiet. Blessed... blessed... blessed quiet. ( John humming tune ) ♪ The beautiful ♪ The beautiful river ♪ Shall we gather ♪ At the river... ( resumes humming ) ( sighs ) Hmm. ( music playing )
