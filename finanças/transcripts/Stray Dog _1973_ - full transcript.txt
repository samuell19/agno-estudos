Open bullet magazines! What?! They took your handgun? Hello?! Where did it happen? Hello? Hello?! Injury incident! Injury incident! Injury incident! On the street of Okubo-cho, Meguro. Emergent deployment requested! Roger! Hey, you, wait. Where are you heading to? - We want to ask you a few questions. - The hell do you want? - We just want a quick word with you. - What? Let us go! We just want to have a quick chat with you. Hey, keep your hands to yourself. We just want to have a talk with you. What's that? Where are you taking us? - They have nothing to do with you! - Let me go! What did we do? - Calm down! - Stop that! Tell me, why the hell are you on this special assignment mission? Metropolitan Police Department says to ask the competent authority. The competent authority says to ask the Metropolitan Police Department. You can't get much out of it! I have a report to be made! The plate number of the motorcycle used in the crime "Ko Kawasaki 908" has not been registered. Probably a counterfeit number. At present, no fingerprints have been found at the scene that could belong to the perpetrators. You couldn't even find, at least, one fingerprint? Only one, from the motorbike. - It was... - Who was that? Yours. Officer Murakami of the Megami Police Station, right? "21 August 1973, around 7:20 pm". "I'm here to investigate a member of the Otomo Kai, named Kosaka", "a suspect of assault and illegal possession of a firearm". "A woman passed by on a street in Okubo-cho", "Meguro-ku, Tokyo, named Toshiko Kawashima, 23 years old..." Are you sure you've questioned her? Yes... "Then, several men, believed to be habitual snatch-and-run criminals", "drove a motorcycle and a passenger car with Yokohama license plate "5 SA 380". "They split up, approached from an unidentified Caroline", "at the end of the road, and attacked the victim". In an attempt to rescue the victim, you pulled out a handgun. Did you identify if any of the other party carried any weapons? Well... But I had a hunch that... A hunch? This isn't an investigation unit. Don't forget that your case is now in the custody of the main office of the Inspection Division. I'm going to ask you one more time. Did you consider the situation to be one of self-defense at that time? What do you think? If you're not careful, your attacker will be found to have acted in self-defense. I am prepared to accept any punishment. I don't care if I will be dismissed. But I'm a detective until I'm sacked! Please, allow me to be a part of the investigation! You are aware of the rule that investigators, who have a direct interest in a case, are removed from it. Mr. Sato... Well, go and wash your hands already. Chief, we're going to take a little walk together now. Together? With Murakami? Yes, I've worked with Murakami before. Besides, he's the only witness so far. An on-duty police officer's gun was taken, and a completely innocent passer-by was injured. Fortunately, it ended in an injury. If this was a murder, the newspapers would have written about it, and it would spill over into the removal of the police superintendent. You've had quite a bad day... - Is my punishment a dismissal, after all? - I wonder... Unfortunately, I'm not a university-educated inspector. - Why don't we go for a little walk? - What? I'm taking you into protective custody from today. That means I have to follow you wherever you go. I was told that I could get old number plates from you. If you go to a demolition yard, you'll find lots of plate numbers rotting away. No one returns the license plate number and reports after the vehicle is scrapped. I see... So, they're rotting away, huh? For you, detectives, I'd say. Nowadays, anyone who does anything wrong with a car, with a registration plate number that can be tracked, is a very stupid person. Then, the guy who searches for the owner by plate number is even dumber. You can say so! Alrighty, alrighty, calm down! By the way, how much would you charge for a plate at your place? Huh? Don't talk to me like that! I would never do such a bad thing! I'm just joking. My bad, my bad. Alrighty, alrighty, calm down... That's an awful joke! - Darling. - What do you want? Why are you always getting into something at your age? Shall I go and check through all car scrappers? Leave that to the special investigators. - Let's go for a little walk. - Any idea what's going on? I know that car with the Yokohama plate number "5 SA 380", which was scrapped two months ago. If what the old man says is right, some people do the wrong thing by leaving their cars to be scrapped without any inspection. - What's the matter? - Nothing. I remembered there was some kind of yellow symbol on the front of the car. Well, the cool breeze on the shore will remind you of it. Let's go. I guess it's much cooler here... Let's see. Tsukuda Pharmacy... Welcome. How can I help you? Sorry to bother you, but could we ask you some questions about Mr. Saburo Tsukuda? What's the matter with my brother? Your brother had a car, didn't he? Grey Caroline, as I recall. I don't know... He went to university in Tokyo and never came back. He hasn't come around here at all. - What is his address in Tokyo? - I wonder... In which university does he study? I don't know more besides that. Anyway, we haven't seen each other for a long time. I smell something fishy... Yeah... Sabu? Saburo, are you here? Sorry about earlier... Is this where your brother sleeps? Yes. Alone? No, with four or five of his friends. What kind of friends? They get together, play guitar, sing songs. Where is your brother now? I'd be grateful if you could join us. We just wanted to meet you and ask you some questions. I don't think it has anything to do with your brother, though. No! Probably, my brother is the culprit. He was making a fuss this evening about paying something off to the police officer. What did he pay for? My brother was in secondary school. Our parents left us early and I took over my mother's role. I was thinking of the police to take my unruly brother under their control. I asked the police to take him in. As soon as I got back from the police, my brother hit me. "Don't look at me like you're looking at an animal!" Then, he punched me in the eye. I can't help but remember the look in my brother's eyes at that moment... I see... Where did your brother go? I believe, to the Kamakura Jazz Festival. I'd be happy to accompany you, but, you see, I... Besides, I probably wouldn't recognize my brother if I saw him. For the last ten years, I've only heard his voice, but didn't look at his face. I've tried not to look into that boy's eyes. Which one of you is Saburo Tsukuda? Is that you? I don't know... - You? - That's not me, you're mistaken... Stand up! You recognize my face, don't you? I saw this yellow symbol very well on the front of your car. You're under arrest on suspicion of gun heist and assault. What? Isn't that an awful lot? You see, our marked car was stolen last night. Is that so? I've heard something about you guys paying off to the police. Hey, Mr. Detective, I'm Saburo Tsukuda. But what the hell did we pay for? Don't you have to see it to know it? For this thing. Anyway, let's get them to the station. Hey... come on! - What's that? - Right. This is what we paid for. We really wanted to get rid of that pistol. Why don't you sit down? It looks like this pile of crap had been cleared up. It wasn't really because of these suspects, but due to their mentioning that Caroline was found with the danger signs that was used to commit the crime. We also found Hoshi's fingerprints. All we have to do now is to track down the suspects in the Yokohama-Kawasaki area, which I know quite well. It won't take more than two days to arrest them all. But I have a feeling that something much worse is about to happen... Why don't you calm down? The victim didn't die yet. - Where are we heading now? - What? To the best place in the world to relax. Welcome back! What, are you off work? You have to take Sunday off, at least. Is that so? Today's Sunday, huh? Here. - So, you've cracked the case? - No, that's Murakami's present. Thank you so much! Please, come inside. - Hello there. - Ah, welcome back. This is Murakami from the precinct we've worked with before. We'll stay here for a while. - This is my wife. - Thank you very much. - Please, come in. - Mother, he got this for you. Thank you very much! Come on, go ahead. Come in. It's a bit of a mess, though. Please. - I'll go out again. - Alright... Don't let him out except on call from the main office. Fine... You might not have enough food. Murakami has a reputation as a glutton. He can easily eat two or three servings. Doesn't smoke, nor drink. His hobby is playing pachinko. Every night he wakes up in the middle of the night, and eats three bags of instant noodles from pachinko prizes. Am I right, Murakami? No, it's only two bags. Yes, Sato speaking. Is that so? What? Where? Understood. I'll be right there. - I'm going out. - Yes. Who was on the phone? Is the victim dead? She died, right? When? Last evening. You stay here until called for. Understand? Mr. Sato! How far have you got with the investigation? What else have you found out? Not much. The only thing I know is that suspect had five bullets in his pistol. Thanks for coming. The crime was probably committed at dawn this morning. As you can see, we didn't discover it until much later... That's dangerous, dangerous! It will collapse... Yes? Okay. It's the same bullets, after all. We're pulling out of this case. It's moving to the competent investigation department. So, we're stopping our special investigation? The Chief Superintendent himself just made this statement to the press. We're not working on it anymore. Chief, about this case... Could you consider adding Murakami to the investigation back again? Are you trying to get me sacked? That's the reply from the Chief. Chief, what model is the pistol? The gun for private use in your jurisdiction is S&W, right? Or is it Colt? I told you not to leave my house. Why are you here? Mr. Sato! That's my gun, isn't it? It's mine, after all. It's not yours. It's the suspect's! Detective Murakami of the Mekama Precinct, right? What kind of pistol was it? S&W? Come on, tell us something! How many bullets were in the magazine? Five, six? Please, tell us something! Come on! The boss gets up every morning to clear out the warehouse. He'd be in a bad mood if he didn't do that. Well, I can't say much more. We're working here 'till late evening. After all, this company isn't closed even after our boss' death. - Alright, let's go. - Yes, yes. The boss's wife is just the same. Anyway, he was a bit of a jerk. He had drivers come and go all the time. He was proud of the fact that he sold a trailer with a bell from a scrapyard that was really knocked up. He's a nag, and if someone would take a break, he'd get the wages cut. - See you later. - See ya! I even punched him right in his face. You can't complain too much about getting killed, can you? If you've given incense, why don't you just go home? You won't get anything else if you come here now. These were taken by a clerk who used to work at your place. - Do you remember any of these faces? - I don't remember anything! Even my own nephew who can't stay, at least, for three days. - Can I borrow them? - Please. - I'll be back for the meeting. - Sure. I wonder if they'll catch the culprits hanging around somewhere there? What? He's not home yet? Why did you let him out on his own? I've told you before. But, darling, he really wanted to go and search for the suspect. Who told you to let him out and search for a culprit? He's a material witness! He's the only one who can identify the suspect! That's enough! Dad, haven't you stopped being a detective? You're just begging for a job, so that you can send me to university. So, don't disturb me when I'm studying for my exams! I don't take orders from you. Then, am I not allowed to go to university? - What did you say? - Darling! What's with that look in your eyes? Kazue, are you also going to tell your father to quit being a detective? What do you dislike in being a detective's daughter? Dear! Say it. If you have something to say, say it. Then, I'll say it. I love my father. But I dislike when he buys cakes to take them home. Our mother told us that our father's custom was to buy a cake to take home on the night he arrested a criminal, even before we were born. That made you really happy, right? For all that hard work which was worth it. But did you ever think if we were happy? Of course we ate it with pleasure when we were kids. But then, I realized that, when we were happy, some people were crying. I didn't even want to look at those cakes anymore. I'm sure our mother and brother Shu hadn't enjoyed them either. You've got a sweet tooth, and so, you celebrate with your cakes all by yourself. Will you stop it? You don't even know that we threw them away. Kazue! I still hate going past the pastry shops. I can't stand looking at cakes on my friends' birthdays. I could see the look on my father's face when he caught a killer. Damn! "Making him stop is a detective's job" - Murakami. Stop that! Don't do it! What did you say? What did you just say? Say that one more time! Now, say again what you've just said! I... I said "stop"... What kind of dialect is that? There are six matches between the car's fingerprints, and those of that Caroline car. This is Mr. Ota, a crime prevention officer, who checked on the owner of the car. - I'm Ota. - Thank you for your hard work. A Six-man snatch-and-grab gang, huh? Mr. Ota, what's the matter today? How was it? The bicycle race the other day. Hello. What, a young woman? What? Ah, I see... Did he say, "Call here and I'll introduce you to a fatty, ready-to-eat amateur girl?" Right, you shouldn't do that. This place is gang-related. Is this a public order crackdown? You know those six young hoodlums who have recently joined your place? Six guys? No way! We're a small business here. This small business loses one car, and doesn't even report it? Ah, a car? That was when Hatsuo's asshole was getting a ride when he was flirting with a girl. Did you see the car? - What about Hatsuo? - That's the last I've heard of him. You're lying! One of your thugs out of that group had killed a person! Oh, is that an assault charge? What happened to that idiot Hatsuo? They asked me to give them a break, and they haven't shown their faces since they've left. I see. I'm very sorry! Next time I see him, I'll make sure he turns himself in. Suspected of abducting women. Unfortunately, I'm not in charge of that. I'm sorry, but can these two come? I just need to get a few fingerprints to be taken. For gambling charges? No, for murder. Big brother! This time, it's a good girl, full of fat and ready to be eaten! Thank you very much! Yes... I see. - Can I borrow it? - Go ahead. And so, where's the pistol? What's that? Do you want to pee? - Go ahead. - Thank you, I'm sorry. His fingerprints are clean. Is that so? I didn't think he was capable of killing, anyway. Then, I'll just have a look around massage parlors a bit more. I'm counting on you. I'm sorry. - Are you relieved? - Yes... So, where and when was the car taken? If that's what you want, I'll remember it. There's a Maruyama Rayon just down the road, right? I left the car in front of the girls' dormitory there. That's right. Oh, I remember. On a Saturday evening. What were you doing in the girls' dormitory? There was a girl with a good face. You see, for pimps, it's important to frame thugs, rather than to draw customers. Sorry, can I have a smoke? What was her name? She said Akemi. I guess her name was Akemi... But, you know, I was really on the track. But then, right at the crucial moment, I had to take a piss. When I came back, I couldn't find her. Then, I've waited for 10 minutes. And then, just when I wanted to go home, there was no car. That was quite a surprise! I heard later that a man came to call her and she went home with him in my car. Novices foresee trouble with such individuals. And that's all. She's not suited to be a call girl. I've left my car there, next to the laundry, and it was stolen. I was mad. Oh, mister, here she is! In jeans and in a pink T-shirt. Damn it! Driving away in other people's cars! Alright, I'll head back to the car. Akemi... Where are you going? Hands up! Please... These hands... couldn't get those suspects! I hear you've walked a lot. But you've got to get a bit better at tailing people. There is only one entrance. That's a cat. Sometimes cats attack pigeons, because they can't see well at night. Misters, you're detectives, right? Well, I guess you can say that. No one will come if you'll wait here. Then, why you are waiting here? ♪ People who work ♪ Hard sweat and toil ♪ They take joy She's not going to stop even if you try. This girl is going to be singing through the night. To let other people know we're on stakeout. ♪ Still hold true ♪ They may know about the world outside ♪ But they still have to work ♪ Working every day with a youthful spirit ♪ Even in their 50s or 60s ♪ They feel like they're still in their 20s ♪ They sing about it ♪ Working hard every day ♪ Helps to save money ♪ As the years pass... I'm sorry. How about telling us about one thing? About what? Don't you know everything else? No. All we know is that one night, a week ago, you borrowed a car from your friend that was parked outside the girls' dormitory, and you drove to Tama River with a friend. We found that car abandoned on the riverbank. What happened there? Oh, what a cutie! But even docile pigeons can turn into savage birds that attack humans when they become wild. Misters, are you Japanese? I suppose we are. Is something wrong with that? Nothing in particular… I just wanted you to know how people feel when they are asked such questions. You are from Okinawa, right? We are told that Okinawa suffered badly during and after the war. Even if you come to the mainland with a dream, your accommodation will be refused. "Do they even speak Japanese in Okinawa?", they'd say. However, that doesn't mean it's okay to kill people. What on earth would compel your friend to kill someone? Maybe somebody's eyes. I don't get it. What do you mean? I don't think people would understand how it feels to be looked at all the time. You think so? A yakuza was shot dead at a construction site in Fuchu. Who shot him? Did they catch him? Tell me! Please, tell me! Everyone, get out and run! Miyazato! Stop that car! Blue car ahead, stop! Pull over! Stop right now! It's the same bullets, after all. First in Meguro, second in Koto-ku, now in Fuchu. What on earth is the connection? Thank you. The victim's recruitment agent was in the sweatshop. He was known for annoying laborers. Nearly a million yen in the safe was left untouched in the restaurant near the crime scene. That was clearly a revenge. But just because they had access to a gun, why should the owner of a scrapyard and a recruitment agent be killed? Only one gun. The victims had no relation with each other. They intend to shoot different people consecutively, one after another. So, there are three more to go...? Maybe they're escapees from the juvenile reformatory? No. They're not such a nice bunch. Why did they have to kill them? Why did he have to risk his life and crash the car to save his comrades? It's Sunday already, isn't it? The Koto-ku incident was early on a Sunday morning, too. Those circles are... probably the dates they're due to commit a crime. They're probably going to shoot one by one, but they know they might be caught in an ambush of our emergency deployment and could be trapped. So, they won't be coming back here. They've got to have a second assembly point somewhere. I'm going to need more men here, so please stay put for a while. I'll be out on an emergency deployment and may be late. Don't worry. I'll be able to arrest them by myself. Okay. Listen, never take your eyes off the girl. Understood. Mr. Detective, please hold me. In return, please help those boys. They cannot impose the death penalty on only one of them, as they are a group. So, are you willing to become an accomplice to murderers? If you want to help, give me their names! I'm leaving! Tokyo-Okinawa Each Week - On Sundays All Year Round Departure - Did you wait? - No, I just got here. Really? What a relief... Miyazaki is so crowded, let's go to Kumamoto. That sounds good. Jun! - Gushiken! - Jahana! You have three hours before departure. Anyway, I need more men immediately. And one more thing. More people are needed at the Yokohama Tsurumi warehouse, and, just in case, at the women's dormitory at Maruyama Rayon in Kawasaki. It's Uehara. Can I have my ticket to Okinawa? Mr. Uehara, right? Suzuki! Stop! Freeze! Stop! Stop or I'll shoot! That bastard Suzuki came there, after all. He's been gone from my house for some time. He followed me because he thought I'd be on the mainland. I thought if I'd get caught, I'd throw up. Katsunori! Give it to Jun. Load it up. The bullets? The warehouse is already encircled. I'm sure Suzuki will talk once he's caught. Let's not dawdle, let's get the three of us on the ship today. We've got two hours... Alright, Jun? Jun! You don't have to shoot if you don't want to. I'll shoot for you. It's the same whether you kill one or two. Can I do it? Katsunori! Let Jun decide. Jun, are you going to do it? Do you have someone you want to kill? There are! There's so many of them! The shooter was supposed to escape on the same ship that leaves every Sunday to Okinawa, is that correct? You participated in the first incident in Meguro on Saturday. Early that next morning, Gushiken killed that scrapyard chief. As decided there, you and Gushiken went to Okinawa on a Sunday boat. Why did someone who escaped once, rushed back again so quickly? Do you place your pals above your parents and siblings? I'm not from Okinawa. What about your parents and siblings? I don't have them. So, all the others are Okinawan? Their names? What's the name of the guy who killed today at Kawasaki Station?! Say it, Suzuki! You've been abandoned by them! - How did it go yesterday? - Nothing special. - Where shall we go today? - I don't know. - See ya! - Bye! Akemi, where have you been since this morning? He wants to meet you right away. I'll wait for you in Shinjuku. You go there now, okay? Wait! Stop! Hey, hey! Who was that just now? One of your friends? He's not one of them. He was about to meet them. He said they want to meet me before they shoot. Jun is not the kind of boy who can kill people. - He couldn't shoot back then either. - Then? On the night of the first incident. Stop getting in my way! I'm going to turn myself in at your expense! And you guys, are you gonna get in my way? We've always been together! If one of us gets caught, we'll all go to prison! That's how we've decided! However, I... I feel sorry for all of you. I'd better turn only myself in! And when I do this final thing I want to do, are you still gonna stand in my way? Are you real men? My friends? What's the point of doing it? All of us can shoot. We'll just be partners in crime, won't we? If I'm going to kill someone, I'll kill right now. How's that? Gushiken! Miyazato! Jahana! Go ahead! Those who agree with Jun can take the bullets. But think about what our parents and brothers had gone through. And remember what we gone through on the mainland. Mr. Detective, we must go together. Jun is in Shinjuku now. - Where in Shinjuku? - I can't really explain. At the place where we first met. Jun! Move! Move! I'll kill you! Jun! Jun! Don't! The boy with the gun is now fleeing in the direction of the east exit of Shinjuku station. Please, inform immediately Things have gone terribly wrong The pistol? Where is it? Spit it! Where's the gun? Mr. Detective, let me ask you one question. Who's the one who reported Shinzato? What are you going to do with the answer? Would you want to shoot him with the last remaining bullet? He's the one who killed my friends. You're the one who killed your friends! You killed them! Katsunori Jahana, right? Mr. Sakaki? Where's Mr. Sato? According to information from the Japan Meteorological Agency, the typhoon No. 24 will be south-southwest of Cape Shionomisaki at 9:00 am today, about 450 km north latitude… How long have you been running this place? What's that, suspicious interrogation? It's been ten years now, and it's about to go bust. The customers are all poor detectives. And they're all on the tab. Those who moved for a new assignment were never seen back again. The police likes pulling them out. Why do all detectives keep doing this work? I have no clue. Most of them just like catching bad guys. One was so happy when he got his first suspect, that he couldn't stop shaking all over. He will never forget this feeling. I didn't shake. I will eventually repay their borrowed money and debts. Where's the chief? Please, burn the incense. Kazue, quickly, go to the bathroom. Oh, my... Mr. Murakami, you don't have to... Please, come in. It happened yesterday at dawn. - Please, come in. - Kazue, go get changed. Sometimes, he'd ramble on about his work. Like, "Murakami's alone at the warehouse in Tsurumi, I must go and see him." Things like that. Here, please. It's my husband's, I don't know if it will fit. I should have been shot instead! Excuse me. Yes? Welcome. Thank you very much for coming. I'm deeply sorry. - Please, come inside. - Okay. - Sorry for disturbing you. - Please. Actually, we've just received the information that the man who shot and killed your husband had been arrested. I'm here to report it. Thank you very much for that. The fact that you arrested Mr. Sato's murderer has something to do with it. You should turn yourself in to the police. You'll be reprimanded. But that will probably change after the arrest. We'll do our best, but you'd better pull yourself together for the time being. That's all you can do to apologize to Mr. Sato. Well then, I will leave. I will see you later. Thank you very much... That's really nothing. Kazue, there's no sauce. And bring the dried plums. Here, they are cold. Go on, eat a lot, have three portions. - Where are you from, Mr. Murakami? - From Shikoku. Really? I am also from Shikoku. It's a great place... I think of home when the canna flowers bloom. There are lots of cannas in my garden in Kochi. I'm sorry, but they look so much alike. - Who? - You see... I was burnt out in Hiroshima, and went back home to Kochi. When? That was well before you were born. There were red cannas in the garden. I was just sitting on the veranda, watching them all in a daze. And then, there's someone standing behind the fence, looking at me. At first, I thought that was a thief. Because he had a beard, and he had a big pile of stuff, and he was staring at me with glazed-over eyes. Who was that? A demobilized soldier from Siberia. And then, he looked at me and said, "So beautiful". Later, he tried to convince me that he was talking about the flowers. Was that my father? I've never heard this before. Well, I couldn't talk about it when your dad was around. Please, have another cup. Kazue, pour him some more. These flowers were planted by my father. He always said, "I want to live in Shikoku when I'll get old". "I'll take you there", he said. "We'll go there together with your mum". "Once you won't be a child, we'll go to Shikoku". "Both of you will wear white kimonos". "I must keep an eye on my daughter". Those were his last words. Everyone said it was a very detective-like will. I... I felt as if I had been told that I never had filial piety... I'm sorry. What are you going to do now, Mr. Murakami? Will you continue being a detective? Yes, the ship will depart. The typhoon delayed the sailing until today. Are you going alone? Why didn't you turn yourselves in? Unless you actually opened fire, you couldn't be a co-perpetrator. Do you know what I mean? You couldn't turn yourself in just because someone was watching over you. One more thing, if one was caught with a handgun or surrendered, he could not pass the handgun on to the next person. That's it. Out of the six of you, three are captured and two are dead. Only one person is left at the end. Which means you don't have to pass the handgun on to the next person anymore. Besides, you don't have to kill anymore to be a worthy co-perpetrator. How's that? Your partner's pistol killed our chief! I've got kids your age. Jahana, every life is precious... Save the lives of your friends, how's that? That's the least you can do to pay for your crimes. Jahana, say something! Where's your other friend? Granny! Come here, please. - She just arrived here by boat. - Granny... She's tired, but nevertheless is here. I heard that you were sending home half of your monthly salary. "How come such a filial son could become a murderer?", she cried. You are cowards! Aren't you the cowards who shot, and killed those who didn't resist? Now, tell me where the last man is in front of your grandmother! She's suffering, just like you are right now. You've done a good job of being accomplices. Don't take any more of your friends down this path. Help your friends, will you? Mr. Detective, give me some water. Fine, tell me where he is before you drink. Please, give me some water!
