Dad. The baby was born. Is it a male or female? It's a boy. Have you given the future any thought? You're too young to handle marriage let alone support a family. Your marriage permit was denied. According to the other townsfolk, without a permit he can't even be officially registered. What are you going to do for his education and after? You also have to pay back the money we borrowed for your wife's dowry. Our house is old and in disrepair. It needs a lot of work. If you sold this one... You're both young. One day you can have another kid. Er Dong Er Dong, be careful with that gun. You think I would actually shoot someone? You little piece of shit. I want to try the gun. Just don't shoot your balls off. - Damn, there's people here already. - Just leave them. Look. Leave him alone, he can't swim. You motherfucker. Go fuck your mother's cunt. Don't go yet. Got to go. I have to take care of some things this afternoon. You have something else you want to say? You want to talk about my mom again? Sister, are you busy? I need some help with something. Have a seat. What's the matter? Praise God. Praise the Lord. It's my son, he frustrates me all the time. All these years since his father passed, I've raised him alone. He doesn't obey me and brings me nothing but trouble. Yesterday he got into a fight and injured the other boy. Today he's missing. I don't know where he is now. Could you offer him your prayers? Place him in the Lord's hands. Praise the Lord, be at peace in your heart. Trust in the Lord. God will show him the right path. From Mathew 7:7, the Lord said, For everyone who asks receives he who seeks finds and to him who knocks, the door will be opened. Nothing to fear From the scriptures we will know the truth. Have faith and the Lord will provide. Let's stand and pray. Mighty God who is powerful and merciful, We thank You, amen. We ask for Your guidance, protection, mercy, and blessing. Amen. May You be with us always. The burdens of our sister are also our burdens. Amen. When we face the troubles ahead, we have no other recourse, Except to put ourselves in Your hands. You created the earth, the world. Guide the course of Creation. Every thing is in Your hands, under Your control including this child. There is no doubt with You as his guide. Don't worry anymore. This matter is in His hands now. Now we must have no more doubts. God promised that, as we trust Him, as He will fulfill. Praise the Lord. Praise him more, and you will receive his blessing. If we invite God into our life there is no more room for fear in our heart. Quickly, quickly. Hurry. Come back. Get on. Hey, Er Dong, let's race again. Fuck your grandpa. The local township church is accepting youth students. I've spoken to them already. You've been accepted. I won't go. I can't stand their rules. You're going, it's final. You have nothing but trouble at home, it's final. Er Dong, wake up. This is the Yellow River. Take a look. Elder Hou, this is my son. Everything will be taken care of. Education is well worth your time. Sit down. - I've got it. - Sit. Do you want to join Pingluxian Christian Art School? Yes. What will you do when you graduate? I don't know. Don't know? Do you believe in Jesus? Do you believe in Jesus? No. If you don't believe in the Lord what's the point? - I don't know. - Don't know? Mother, what do you want him to do when he graduates? Praise the Lord, it's up to him to choose. He can choose. Our purpose at this school is to glorify God, praise him. Do the work of the church redeem mortal men save their immortal souls. Where do we come from, and where do we go? What is your reply? Praise the Lord... you don't know. I'll tell you. In the beginning the Lord God formed man from the earth's dust, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and the man became a living being and his name was Adam. This is the first man in the world. When the Lord God created man He also created woman. When He made woman, He took one of man's ribs, and made woman. Therefore, God create man from the dust, and created woman from man. Praise God. Therefore the world is filled with love, Filled with the love of man for woman. After God created man and woman, He put them in the Garden of Eden, and they were happy. But there was a prohibition from God. What is the prohibition? You may eat the fruit from any tree in the garden. But you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. For when you eat of it you will surely die. But because of the temptation from the serpent, they at the fruit. Eve ate the fruit, and then gave the fruit to Adam, and Adam ate the fruit. In that moment they saw themselves naked, so they hid themselves. When God walked in the garden the Lord God called to man, "Where are you?" Adam was afraid to answer. God called: "Adam, where are you?" Adam said that "I saw we were naked. "When we heard that you were walking in the garden, we hid." God asked, "who told you that you were naked? "Have you eaten the fruit from the tree that I commanded you not to eat from? "Now you ate the fruit. You will surely die." So the Lord God banished him from the Garden of Eden. Why? The fruit wasn't poisonous. But man had disobeyed his God. Everyone has done right and wrong. Sometimes they excel and other times they just get by. Everyone has their ideal dream. Sometimes they succeed and other times they fail. No matter what you do. Even an ordinary man can aspire to high character. Okay. Stop. Listen to me. "No matter what you do." "Even an ordinary man can aspire to high character." Mom. Why aren't you in class? - Why didn't you tell me you were leaving? - It's getting late. I have to catch the bus. If I don't leave now I can't get home. When you get back, don't let anyone ride my bike. If you aren't there, there's no one who'd ride your bike. Don't let anyone touch my gun either. It'll rust after a while, could you maintain it for me? All you do is fool around. Now that you're in school, I want you to concentrate on your studies. Listen to God and don't get any smart ideas. Are you Er Dong? How do you know my name? God told me. What's your name? Why don't you ask God? I asked your name, don't fuck around. My name is Cao Xiaojun. Where are you from? Caochuan. Caochuan? People from there are supposedly stuck up. People from there ARE stuck up, but I'm different. Where are you from? You can't tell I'm a local from my accent? So is this place cool? You'll see. Praise the Lord. God knows how many strands of hair are on your head. God has already lightened the burden you carry. Do not fear the way ahead. All who are His children are at peace. Very good. Er Dong! Cao Xiaojun! You two, what's going on? The others are taking this seriously, and you two are goofing off. Don't let there be a next time. Okay, we're done for today. Class dismissed. Let's go for brunch. There's this place. Let's get some jellied bean curd? Let's go. God knows how many strands of hair are on your head. Little Chang'e 2 bowls of jellied bean curd and 2 fried breadsticks please. Check her out. Stop pointing her out, you're embarrassing me. Little Chang'e, you making good money working here? Are you Er Dong? You know me? You used to get into fights all the time, right? - What? How would you know something like that? - I'm from Caochuan too. We're neighbours. Enough already. Eat. When I was young, I was taught that men shouldn't cry. Now that I've reached maturity, I tell myself in the mirror to have no regrets. Life goes in a cycle. Life causes the heart to fluctuate. Everyday we all wear masks to bed. There's a sickness in my heart. Men, it's not a sin to cry to cry to cry. Know the taste of your tears. Life has its beauty even when it rams. It shouldn't be so hard to be a man. Men, it's not a sin to cry to cry to cry. Know the taste of your tears. Life has its beauty even when it rains. It shouldn't be so hard to be a man. Just have a good cry. You're awfully quiet. She's no one special. She's just a waitress at a poor eatery. She's just thinking about the next meal. And she's fuck ugly. She goes to our school. She's learning to play the organ. You see those gangster wannabes? All the hot chicks around here... they're the type that gets the girls. Er Dong. Where do you want to go this weekend? Where's cool? I could show you my neighbourhood. My neighbourhood is a better place than yours. How are we getting there? Well since we don't have a jet, I guess we're walking. Wait... I've got stuff to take care of. I'll let you know tomorrow. Yeah sure, Mr. Busy. Hey, I was thinking... maybe I could take my motorcycle to school. Absolutely not. You're a student, and have no reason to be out with your bike. Other students all have their bikes. That's them... That's them, not you. I got you that bike for after you get married. Look, I'm taking the bike today. No, I forbid it. Don't try me. Go ahead, just you try Er Dong! What are you... I'll kill you! Lijing, it's Sunday... What are we doing today? I'm not sure. But where do you want to go? I'm cool with whatever you want. Let's go to Sanmenxia or to downtown. - Sanmenxia then. - Sanmenxia. - Hey, you have any girlfriends? - Why? I know I have you already... I'm asking for my friend here. You know someone? What friend? You don't know him. His name is Er Dong. I don't have any girlfriends. Oh okay. - Did you have lunch yet? - No. - Let's go after lunch then. - Okay. Xiaojun. - Who's bike? - Mine. - You've got a bike? - Yes. - Let's go. - My girlfriend, Lijing. Why don't you go back? We'll go out next weekend, okay? Okay. We have business to take care of. Later. So where are we headed? We said already, you'll show me your neighbourhood. You've got a bike. So fucking cool. Is your dad a hotshot or something? Shit, slow down. - You pissing your pants? - Fuck no. Yeah? Then we're not slowing down. What a "nowhere" place. Whole county's got one fucking street. "Nowhere"? We've got 2 streets. 2 streets? That's nothing. There's 4 downtown and that's "nowhere" too. You've been downtown? No, but I know. Let's get out of here. Have some. Did you have lunch yet? Come. We're going to see the principal. Come. Come on. - Who are you here to see? - I'm here to see Elder Hou. - And this is regarding? - I'm Er Dong's mother. There's some things I need to discuss. He's not in today. You can discuss the matter with me. Let's go to my office Something like this is actually quite trivial. Likely you don't understand our system here. We're like an adult school. We don't enforce conduct. And your son's not a child anymore. These days, girls expect boys to have motorcycles. It isn't that I don't let him ride his bike. I bought the bike for him to use after he's married. He's reckless on his bike. I worry whenever he's out riding. Your son is doing well. How about this? Let me look after your son. Don't worry. I'll keep an eye on him for you, okay? - I have nothing else. - Okay. We're done then. Let me give you a ride back home. No need. Just concentrate on your studies. I'll take the bus. So what just happened? I'm confused. If your head hurts then don't worry about it. Mr. Ma seems pretty cool. What? Mr. Ma is so not cool. Why do you say that? Not cool. I'm not joking... you'll see. Don't hang around with him. Praise God. This is diode number two. It's got two polarities. You measure the charge from this pole to that one. There's a current. If you read it in reverse, there's no current. See? No current. If there's a current anyway, then the diode is busted. Do you know what you use a diode for? 10 and 2 ball, corner pockets. Hey Er Dong, light my cigarette. Give it to Mr. Ma. Thanks. What number is it? Don't know if this shot is possible. - Light one for me too. - Fuck off. Crack your head open. What up? Go play Mr. Ma. I don't know how. I'm so full. Let's go back. Didn't you want to get a haircut? Let's go back, it's night already. I dare you to go get a haircut there. Let's just go. You're chicken. Why are you making a big deal out of that place? Go get your hair cut. We'll go take a look around. You want to play some poker? No. How come you haven't gotten to my haircut yet? I don't have scissors. How can you open a barber shop without scissors? Hey, you haven't paid yet. - How much? - 5 yuan. 5 yuan just for a hair wash? It's hair wash and scalp massage. Didn't you feel better after the massage? Hey Mr. Ma. Whose TV is that? It's Elder Hou's. Cheap bastard. This thing's busted and he still wants me to fix it. You know how to repair TVs? They don't let me repair planes, so TVs it is. - Is it soldered? - It's done. Let me see. Good. A bit too much solder. I still don't get circuits. Don't worry about learning circuits yet. Practice the basic practical skills first. Learn to use less solder, but make sure it's still weld tight. Look, see all that solder you used. I'll teach you circuits later. By the way, the presbytery just had their elections. The new deacons are meeting soon. Your class is performing a short program. You and me, we're in charge of the lights and the sound system. Make sure everything still works, so that there aren't any mishaps. Okay? Okay. Didn't you get a haircut yesterday? Where did you go? We couldn't find you I went to the barbershop, but they didn't even have scissors. No scissors? That sounds wrong. Have a good time with the girl working there? Did you play poker? No. They invited me, but I didn't play. Why were you out so late then? Hey why are there all these poker cards here? It's not a full deck. Take them, have fun. Hey Er Dong. What are you doing here? Nothing really. Downtown is just 3-4 km over the bridge. You have some business there? No. You want to play poker? The church doesn't allow gambling. 2 bowls of jellied bean curd, 1 fried breadstick. Okay. Fuck, I couldn't catch her. Who? My girlfriend, who else? Which girlfriend? What other girlfriend do I have? Just Lijing. Her family doesn't want her at the school anymore, took her home. - Is it fixed? - Done. Change the frequency duct. And the line tube as well. Get rid of that 6020. It's too hot, let me cool off. Mr. Ma. - Mr. Ma. - Come in. Er Dong, you're here? Yes. Hey Mr. Ma, is Elder Xiu's fan fixed yet? Not yet. I've been busy these past two days. I'll fix it within the next two days and take it over. If that's all, I'm going. What's the rush? Hang out with us. I've got to get back and practice. I'm off. Okay. I'm bored Er Dong, let me have the keys to your bike. I want to take it out for a spin. Er Dong, I'm amazed how quickly Mr. Ma fixed the fan. Actually I fixed it. He doesn't know how to fix fans. Put it there. You know how to fix fans? I can fix anything, except planes. You're awesome. What do you think? How often do you go home to see your mom? I'm going home in two days. I'll let you know. The smiling mask hides a broken heart. It shouldn't be so hard to be a man. - Men, it's not a sin to cry to cry... - Stop. stop. It's awful. Why don't we just go see her? You don't even like her. Who said that? If I didn't like her, I wouldn't still be with her. Let's go. Give me a ride there. - How far is it? - Far. I'll ask Mr. Ma for a break. - Where's Mr. Ma? - I don't know. What is it? I'm here for my keys. You're not going anywhere, why do you need them? Go, leave. Er Dong, where have you been these past two days? Where's Elder Xiu's fan? - I returned it... - You're quite skilled. You think you're so smart... Do things your own way. You don't know, but you're in big trouble. The new elder, who was just appointed, takes education and conduct seriously. When you two ditched class... you put yourselves right in front of a loaded gun. How do you expect me to speak for you? Where's Cao Xiaojun? The new elder met with me today. An example will be made of one of you. When Xiaojun returns, you two decide which one will be expelled. You are a decent student... you've been with me for a while. You're skilled at soldering. I would have taught you circuitry as well. After graduating you'd have been able to repair TVs, refrigerators... Opened a small repair business. You'd have learned a lot more than just choir class... made a good living, while your classmates... who'll listen to them sing? Nobody. Here, have a cigarette. Er Dong. What a mess. A family has rules, a nation has laws, a church has sacraments, a school has its standards. You've disobeyed the church's sacraments and violated our school's standards many times. Despite the necessity of your expulsion, our Lord has not forsaken you. Here, I will pray for you. O Jesus. Father, Son and Holy Spirit. The truthful and faithful God. Dear Lord, I thank You and praise You. I put this child into Your hands. Lord, although he has strayed from Your path, He did not understand Your words. Now that he is leaving us, Lord, may You still be with him. Never abandon him. Er Dong, you're going home? Just when I didn't want to be here anyway. They expelled me. - So you're not going to school anymore? - No more school. Education isn't so important. I don't want to learn the organ anymore. Then what will you do? It'd be a useless skill back home anyway. Music is good for your personal enrichment. Okay, I'm off. Hey, you want to come with me? Okay? You and me together. We're home. Come help me do some cleaning. It's almost dark. I don't want to do cleaning now. After rent and groceries, we just have 300 yuan left. It's not enough money. We have to get jobs. That's no problem. Downtown's so big, of course we'll find a place. I sold my bike already, so we have to get married. No way! I'll kill you. - How old are you? - 19. - You? - 19. Do you know how to cook? Nope. I need workers with skills. You have no skills. I don't need workers like you right now. But her... She could wait tables. She has a pleasing look. I'll give you a chance, and talk of your compensation if you work out. You wont have the same wages as someone who's been here a long time. Try, and see if it works. You two talk it over. You two are together... you two are? Okay? And you? Is this hard work? Nope. Not hard. I've heard that it's easy to work illegally in the kilns. Is this illegal? Of course not. Are you from around here? Of course. Shit, if you're from here, how can you put it like that? I hate when locals talk in terms of illegal work. Here's my principle. A government leads to corruption. A coal mine leads to a cave-in. A kiln leads to illegal kiln work. You get it? I'm exhausted. I make 200 yuan a month, and you'll make 400 to 500. After rent, we can save a little. We'll save it and spend it on our wedding. How do you want to split the money? After we're married, you keep all of it. I've been homesick, I want to go see my parents. You don't want to go see your mom? No. You go ahead and go home. I just got this job. I can't go home yet. - What's this for? - SARS. It's to prevent infection. We're obeying the call of the Party. Have some medicine. Take it. Drink it. Get off here. We paid for the whole trip. How come you aren't taking us further? Blame SARS, not me. How are we supposed to take our luggage? This isn't a matter of how. There's a police checkpoint up ahead. If there's any problem we'll be hospitalized for 15 days. It's about 3km ahead to town. It's too far, we can't walk that far. One step at a time. - There's a police checkpoint... - Please take us just a little bit further. No way. You just have to walk. Help me with this. Quickly, faster. What are you doing here? You scared me. I came to see you. Why did you bring a gun? I might need protection from your folks. Let's go somewhere else and talk. - Dad! I'm going to grandma's. - Okay. You've been gone for a whole week, and you didn't come to see me. My dad wants me back in school. If I don't go he'll make me marry someone else. What? What did you tell him? I told him I'd go back to school, after staying a few days at home. Come with me. You and me together. Chang'e! Over there. I saw them, they were right over there. To the top, chase them. After we catch him we'll beat the shit out of him. Fuck him up for good. Over there, after him. Chang'e! Chang'e! Come with me. Oh. When did you get back? Just now. Where's your bike? What happened to your bike? I parked it near the main road. Did something happen? Just came to see you. To see me? Are you out of money? Did you come to ask for some money? Here is 100. Spend it more carefully next time. Making money is not easy for me. Soon you will have much bigger expenses. Have some food first. Can't. Still have some things to take care of. What things? Have some food first. Where are we going? As far as we can. There's no one else here. Come in. Have a seat. Your mom, she still has six cows. She's had it tough. Everyday she has to cut the grass... make money to support you. And you're out here causing trouble Er Dong, you think I can get you work in the quarry? You can't do the work I'll see if I can find an easier job for you. You should find some handywork. Clean up this place a bit first. I'm going out to pick up some blankets for you. Hey, get up and clean. Why are you just sitting there? Go find some way to cover up the windows. What's going on? You want me to clean the whole room by myself? Shit. All this dust. One of the workers left a few days ago. This is his set of blankets I found. You'll just have to make do for now. I'll bring you another set in a couple of days. Just make sure the room stays clean. One more thing. All the workers are male. There are no female workers. The cleaning and cooking are all done by men. Er Dong, what's this girl's name? Chang'e. Chang'e, be careful. Don't get into trouble. Okay. While he's at work, just stay home. If there's nothing else, I'm going. Get cleaning. Er Dong. Yes. How did you know I'm Er Dong? Of course I know who you are, - You don't recognize me, do you? - No. You'll know who I am... after we talk a bit. Let me explain how we're related. The quarry master... he's my son. He's your uncle. So you've figured it out now, right? I'm your grand uncle. Your grandmother is my sister. Our parents are your great grandparents. When your grandma and I were kids, we ate together, played and lived together. Then when we were in school we still ate and lived together. Then later, I went on with my education for 7 or so more years. After I graduated I found work on my own. Just like the young people these days... getting into trouble all over the place. For a few years I learned medicine from a rural healer, but when I came back home there was no use for it. And then the local school needed community teachers, so I started teaching in the rural areas. I did that for 7-8 or so years. Then I heard that the government was developing the Baiaidi Coal Mines. A national coal mine. They were looking for more workers, so I came... came and found work. I chose this work because I just enjoy hard work. Didn't do too much. Everyday I had some janitor work, some handywork, spraying water on the coal dust. The coal mine was so dusty. To clean the dust off. First spray the water, then dust. You could call it sanitation work. Then because of the nation's economic development, the mine closed down. We couldn't mine anymore. The nation was going to privatize the mine. Your uncle had some money saved from outside work. When he returned he bought the mine and became the current quarry owner. He bought a house for me. But because I still enjoyed hard labor, I couldn't settle down. So I returned to the mines to work. Ironically, now that you need a job, my son now has an excuse to make me retire. It's fine too. I'm an old man now, I'm done. You're a young man. Mining is good work for you, right? You're young. Work hard. Make yourself useful to society. Could you wash my back? Okay. I don't want to end up here. Why? There's only men here and no other women. While you're working, I'm out of my wits here, waiting. You could go watch TV at our neighbor's place. Our neighbors are all men. No women. I've only seen one other woman. She's the cook. She's from Sichaun. I can't understand her when she speaks. I don't want to go. Well, what do you want to do? There's a restaurant right outside the quarry. I want to find work there. I met my grand uncle today. He says the women there are loose women. You can't work there. Really? Hey, my grand uncle says I take after my mom. Do you see it? You? Sure, very much. You resemble me too. Truly? She's definitely pregnant. Uncle, what do we do? I don't see this as a big issue. They both consented. What's your name? - Chang'e. - Where's your family? Yangjiagou. Then it will not be a problem. I have a cousin named Guan Caolan. She's also from Yangjiagou, and married into your village. When you get home... look her up. She can arrange things between your families. She can speak on your behalf, and everything will go smoothly. They both consent. So even if someone objects, there are no major difficulties. Consent to what? She's knocked up already. They're both willing. Let's ask them. What do you say? Er Dong, what do you say? I will. I spoke to her family. They aren't looking for too much. To bring two children in front of the Lord... Praise God. In Deuteronomy 28 it is said. If you obey the Lord your God, all these blessings will come upon you and accompany you. You will be blessed in the city and blessed in the country. Thanks to the Lord. In terms of marriage gift, you can choose whatever you wish. Any gift will make do. Their family wants us to match a motorcycle. I had bought a motorcycle for him. It was for his wedding, but he sold it. But if their wish is for a motorcycle, I'll buy one for him. - Thanks to the Lord. - Buy one for him. Lastly, what date should we set for the wedding? Thanks to the Lord. We are all God's believers. We trust in God. Let God decide the date for us. Let us rely on God for our needs. Praise the Lord. Why are you sneaking around? Come in. Getting married, and you're still sneaking around... - Er Dong, did you eat yet? - I ate. What's your business here today? Regarding the wedding, my mom said it has to wait. Because of SARS, people are prohibited from congregating. If the guests can't come, they can't give us the wedding gift money. If you want to marry her, then do it. Your family won't get any gift money. Our family won't either. The SARS crisis isn't going to end any time soon. Chang'e's belly is going to show more and more. What's your plan then? Are you going to marry or not? You choose. I'm not like that. Actually, I mostly came to see Chang'e. You can't see her the month before the wedding. If you do, it'll bring ill omens to your marriage. Then I guess I'm going. Why are we stopping? There's another marriage ahead of us, which is a good sign. Congratulations! Have a smoke. Here, just let us pass first. Let's go. God is eternal. God is merciful. When God created Man, He made Man and Woman. Today we ask God to grace this couple who ask for your blessing today. Let them carry out the promise they are making today. After their marriage, let them take care of one another and respect one another. Let their love last to the end of their days. We pray in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Uncle. Er Dong, where is your mother? It's local custom that the parents don't come to the wedding. So few people came. A wedding shouldn't be this dreary. Xiao Xu. Take this, 5000 yuan. Spend it wisely. You're a young man now and must be dedicated to your work. The coal industry is getting tougher and tougher. I'd like to go into something else. I've heard that there are many young directors from our Shangxi province. But I don't run in those circles. If I could, I would try my hand in the culture industry. After you have your kid, bring your family to visit me. Look, it's starting to rain again. Give my regards to your mother. That's all. Take care then. Thanks uncle. Drive safe. More, more. Okay! Enough, good, stop. 300 yuan. Here's 100. Go get something to eat. - Mom. have something to eat. - What do you have? - It's good. - I'm not hungry. Don't waste your salary, have some prudence. - Will you eat? - Some melon seeds. No melon seeds today. - All you think about are melon seeds. - What? You're trying to trick me! Go eat. Stop it. I was watching that. All you do is change the channel. Dinner's ready. Okay. I'm so tired. Quick, before it gets cold. Practicing for when you're the boss? You two, eat. I'll just have some soup. I don't want to haul rocks anymore. What would you rather do? My job is too dangerous. The local committee is selling off parts of the forest. 1,000 yuan per lot. If we bought a lot, I could sell the trees. Who would you sell the trees to? The mine needs lumber. All our village has remaining that's worth anything are those trees. If you cut down the trees, finding a buyer is easy. If you're set on it, it's not my concern. You have a new idea every day, but you get nothing done. Er Dong, come eat. Okay. You go home first. Slowly, watch your step. We're from the Forestry Commission. You cut down these trees here? - I only cut the little trees. - It's illegal to cut down even those trees. - A little tree is still a tree. - I bought this lot. From whom? The local commissioner. This is state property. Even bought from the commissioner, it's illegal for you to cut them. Since you've cut just a few trees, I'll only fine you 500 yuan. I don't have that money. This is the fine notice. We do everything by the book. Look, I really can't afford this. You can afford a bike, but not this fine? We'll confiscate your bike then. You'll get it back when the fine is paid. Come down. Come down here! I found the man that was in that fight with Huhu. He was taking a piss in our river. I kicked his bike into the river. Stop getting into trouble. He started it. If it wasn't for our village's reputation for solidarity... my bike would have been confiscated. No one has the balls to pick on us. You're going to be a father soon, and you're still getting into trouble. Er Dong, there's a fight with another village! Quick! Okay. He's here. Let's go. Go, go. Mom, where's my gun? It was confiscated. - How could you let someone take it? - The local police rounded up all the guns. If I didn't hand it over, not only would we get fined, they'd have taken me to jail. Let go! You're wasting your breath. - Why are you trespassing on our land? - We just are. What right do you have? Fight. Police! Let's go. - Did you see anyone from my village? - How come? - There was a situation. - What situation? - Just a situation. - What situation? - What do you have a hatchet for? - My work. Where do you work? Come with me. - Where? - Let's go. No. - Go. - No. Go go. - No. - Go, go, go. Wait in that room. Who gave you permission to sit? Get up. Squat. Squat. Quick. Put the hatchet down. Are you ready to talk? About what? Fighting and assault, 500 yuan fine. I have no money. What happened to the money you made from selling the wood? The Forestry Commission reported you to us. They gave us your case. Negligent lumber cutting, 1000 yuan fine. No money. If you can't pay, you can't leave. Think it over. Think carefully. - Is that man in there Er Dong? - Yes. Wasn't he the wedding couple you met on your same wedding day? Yes. He was the one that hit you by the river? Yes. Here, go in. He's all yours. I'll take care of it. Over there. Sit. Can I have some food? Hey you're a policeman now? My uncle works here. I joined when they were recruiting a while ago. My uncle wants me to teach you a lesson. Don't fight back, we're all police here. If you dare fight back, we'll fuck you up good. You're lucky I'm a law officer now. Fighting is wrong, so I don't want to hurt you. Our society is changing into a law-abiding nation. A nation that respects the rule of law. You understand? The rule of law. A while ago, you chopped those trees that were protected by the law. And today you were going to get into a fight. All your actions are illegal, you understand? What my uncle wants to do to you doesn't matter. What I want to do to you doesn't matter. This is you against the nation. You can't escape the law. You must pay the fine for the trees. No exceptions. If you don't pay the fine, it'll mess you up for the rest of your life. A hair wash. Her mouth is so precious. You missed her birth. What are you doing here? Let me hold her. Don't. Your hands are cold from outside. Did you want a boy or a girl? A girl. I gave you a girl. Er Dong, take me home. How's your mother? She's doing well. What did you name your daughter? - What? - You're daughter's name. Yang Jiahui. That's a name suited for a Hong Kong movie star. We had an expert come up with that name. - Hey, did your uncle get you a job? - Yes, everything's done. Now I'm working at the Forestry Commission. as a Forest Ranger. I'm responsible for our village's forest area. The work is exhausting. Could you chop for me a while? No way. I'm a Ranger now. I won't be able to hang around with you anymore. Don't let me catch you chopping trees anymore either. Those two didn't even get a marriage permit before having their kid. That'll be trouble. Family planning is so strict these days. They'll have difficulty getting her on the registry. If she isn't registered, she'll have trouble getting into schools. And later, work... whatever, all trouble. It'll be one stress after another. How about this? I have a distant relative. He's been married for over ten years. They can't have kids. They don't have a kid. If things aren't working out, they could raise your son's daughter for him. They're still young, and they can have a kid later on. It would make my relatives so happy to have a kid. They can also compensate for the baby. This will take care of all the problems you are facing. They would be so happy to raise your granddaughter. It would be mutually beneficial for everybody. Think it over. Out! Get out of my house! Take a good look at yourself, you bum. I came to help. I'm trying to look out for you. - How dare you get mad at me. - No one asked for your help. Get out! Go. Look at you... a mongrel. He was just making a suggestion. If you don't want to hear it, be polite about it. You should head to work. Go. Er Dong, wait! I made some steamed buns, take them. Eat them when you're hungry. Be careful, the roads are bad. Drive slowly. Get out, out. Get out. You were warned, and yet still break the law. Okay, enough enough. He had it coming. Stop! Stop! Give my gun back! Stupid moron. Hit him. You want some more? - This is his gun? - This was his gun. Take it. Shoot him. With the gun. Do it. Shoot him... with the gun. Take a good aim. Take a good shot. Shoot him. Do it. Hurry up. Shoot. No bullet... this time. Next time it'll be loaded. Let's go. You've been in bed for two days. Your mom made this for you. Come eat it... before it gets cold. Hold him. Quickly, hold him. What's with you these couple days? Come here. What is it? Tell me. My mother... I'm not her real son. I know. How could you know? I just know. Everyone in my village knows it too. I heard from someone else. Your dad passed away when you were 8, then your mom raised you alone. She raised you even better than a real son. Even though you're not her real son. She would still get you anything you wanted. She loves you so much. Who's my real mom? Who's my real dad? Where's my dad from? Where's my mom from? Here. Count it. Who's my mom? Who's my dad? Where's my mom from? Where's my dad from? I asked a question. Why don't you answer me? Why? Come. This is called the "Cliff of Children Sold". Sometimes when a couple have a kid they don't want, they will come here to sell it. But you weren't bought. When your dad was still alive, he had just returned after being away a while, When he passed by here, he found you and took you home. Since it was snowing, we named you Er Dong (Winter's child). So I don't know who your birth parents are. You're lying! I'm not my mom's real son. I know. You've been repeating this over and over again. I'm not my mom's real son. I'm not my mom's real son. I'm not my mom's real son. I'm really not my mom's real son. Daddy. Mommy. Let's go. Go where? Just get on. Er Dong. The flour mill is still running. Where did you go? I spent all my savings on this flour mill machine so you don't have to work so hard. How could you leave? Chang'e, are you there too? Chang'e, speak some sense to him! Where are we going? As far as we can.
