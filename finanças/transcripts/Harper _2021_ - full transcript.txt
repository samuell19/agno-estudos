Harper? Ms. Cooper would like to see you. Harper? Are you familiar with the name Etta Brown? Honey, we found your aunt. Who is it?! Good morning miss, my name is Ben. - I'm from the Greenland... - No need. Go away! We have a new family policy and we make sure everyone has a policy that works for them. - And... - Are you deaf? Holy shit! I said get off my property. At least let me fill you in on the details - of the policy... - You're gonna need a life insurance policy if you say another word. - Now get... - Okay! I've been calling all day. Must be an old number. I guess we're gonna have to pay Ms. Etta Brown a visit tomorrow. If she even still exists. Hurry up, or you're gonna miss dinner! Yes, ma'am. I'm going. Here. You must be hungry. "Etta Brown"? Good morning honey! Are you excited to meet your aunt? Good morning! May I speak with Ms. Etta Brown please? You already are. I'm Mary Cooper, head of The Hope Community Home. And this is Harper, Harper Brown, Your niece. When did it happen? Just a couple of months ago, we've been taking care of Harper ever since. I'm very sorry about your loss, Ms. Brown. Beer? Where's her mother? Mr. Brown's been taking care of Harper by himself all these years. So she abandoned her? Miss... Miss Brown! Go find her mother. I'm-I'm sorry? You heard me. Ms. Brown. I'm afraid that you are the most eligible caretaker. Then the girl's in a lot more trouble than you thought she was. You stop wasting all of our time, and go find the girl's mother. Harper. Harper! Just in case you change your mind. Hey! Why is she still here? It's Jenny's turn! It's okay. She's still new. Why did you come back? Are you deaf? Answer the question! We're just curious. Welcome to your new home. This is not my home. And you're no different than me. Take your stuff and get out of here! Happy life? Your life is trash. How's the meal? I apologize for what Beth said this morning. No hard feelings? That's your official welcome. [dramatic underscoring What's your name? Arthur? John? How about "Max"? You like this name? Max. Good boy. Good boy. Gah! You changed your mind, Ms. Brown? Can I pick her up today? Of course. I'll wait outside. I'll tell Harper right away. She'll be thrilled. No. She's the only family you have. So what? She didn't even want anything to do with me. She's your aunt. Honey. She can give you a home. That is not my home. Look honey, I know this is tough for you, but you have to move on. Lots of girls here would give anything to have a real home to go to. I know it's not perfect. But she's your family. Don't worry. I will always have your back. Max! You want to come with me? No no no! I'm here for you, not him. I won't leave without him. - Max... - Fine. He stays outside. Okay okay. Max, Max come here. No no no. In the back. Oh okay. Okay Max. Up! Come on! Okay. Come on Max! Hey, I said he's not allowed inside. Then where's he gonna sleep? That's not my problem. - Get... - Hey hey! Easy easy! Here, Max. This will keep you warmer. Come on. I'm sorry that you have to stay out here tonight. I'll figure out something in the morning. Promise. I'm thirsty May I have some water? Thank you! It's delicious. I didn't hear anything about you from my dad. Yeah. I bet you didn't. Grab your stuff. You'll sleep in here. You will clean it up. You'll find what you need. It's our big first day, Max! What are you doing? I was just making breakfast. This is mine. Yours is in the pan. I told you he wasn't allowed inside. Alright you now listen to me. This is my house. You follow my rules. Food is not free here, you hear me? Your dad taught you how to make this? Uh-huh. 'Paddle your own canoe', that's what he taught me. I know how to do a lot of things. Rinse twice or there'll be residue. Didn't he teach you that? These are not my dishes. Excuse me? I said um... sure thing! Twice it is! You're a farm girl now. Remember that. Hello? Ugh! Ugh What are you doing in here? Um... I'm cleaning the room. Come with me. Ah! Ah! Wh-what? No! It's part of the job. I can do something else for you, like... Clean the house or... - chop more wood instead... - Stop bargaining. I did it as a kid, and no one asked if I wanted to. Princess! Don't call me "Princess." Daddy used to call me that. Don't you dare... Hey, it's okay. My name is Harper. I won't hurt you. Are you lost? Where's your family? Bye. Ah! Ew. Smells bad huh? I'll clean it up every day, so Aunt Etta won't be mad again... ah... Ew, ew, ew, ew, ew... Dear Dad, I cleaned the stable today! I wish you could meet my new friend "Ben no". I am sure you would love him. Aunt Etta doesn't seem to like me very much, but I believe everything would work out in the end, like you always say. Wake up, lazy girl! Got a long day ahead of us today. We have long days every day. The key turns it on. The pedal is the gas. This lever controls the bucket in the front. The first thing you wanna do is to turn the key to the right. And then the gas. Just push it really slowly. You don't wanna lerch yourself. Go flyin'. Ready? Why do I need to learn to drive this? Stop talking and focus. Turn it on to the right. Harder. You can do it. There you go. And now the lever. Alright that's good. Now the gas. Just a little bit, just a little bit. I can feel it now. Woohoo! I know how to drive a tractor! Yeah. Look at me go. I chopped up all the wood yesterday. Put it all in storage? Uh-huh. Oh. And I also piled up all the hay together, nice and neat. Alright. You're not eating any veggies. I don't eat those. I said I don't eat these. You don't have a choice in the matter. That's good for you? In a way. Were you close to Dad? No. Then why do you keep his guitar? I saw it while I was cleaning. I don't remember, it's just what's left of the old house. When was the last time you saw him? When I was your age. Stop talking. Finish your meal. Taste good? Alright. One, two, three. On the chair. Aunt Etta, were you ever angry with dad? I know he wasn't perfect. He couldn't always pay the bills. And he was often late. He was never on time a day in his life. But... even by candlelight, eating pizza together, telling stories... always made me feel warm and safe when we were together. We used to move around a lot. I remember when he taught me how to play the guitar, that was fun. And the songs he taught me still inspire me when I'm feeling... lonely. Where's your mom? Dad said she left right after I was born. Ma'am? Any updates? We found a Community Home on the east side. Keep me informed. Yes, ma'am. How! Why isn't it ready yet? We've had to push it back several times. The procedures are a little bit.. Cumbersome. I want my daughter now! Hey Ms. Brown! Here's that Lucas boy. Will you grab that basket for him? Oh, hi! I'm Lucas. Here you go. Are you new around here? I haven't seen you before. I'm Harper. I'm her niece. Oh, nice to meet you. Well, thanks for the eggs. Nice to meet you too! Over there. A little bit over there. You OK, little guy? I'll name you Bobby. Careful, careful. Oh, my dresses are not treats. What's your name? Peace. Do you like it? Come on, Ben no. You can't be too messy. Who's Ben no? See, he said, 'Hi, aunt Etta!' You're wasting your time. Well, Ben no is my friend, just like Peace and Bobby. Peace and Bobby? Yeah, Peace is a lamb and Bobby is a chicken. Quit messing around, kiddo. Hey. Follow me. Hold the reins like an ice cream cone, Now, when he picks up speed, you're going to want to go up when his outside legs go up. That's called posting, Okay. Nice. Yeah, I'm almost there. You need to practice. You heard me? Yes, Aunt Etta. Good. Oh, look at this. You are gonna be a pretty good cook. And... What's this? It's a key to the house. It's your house, too. Thank you. You know what? I'll wash all the dishes and then clean the house. - And I'll wash all the clothes... - Okay. Okay, let's just enjoy our meal first, okay? Harper. Harper! Where's my beer? That dog of yours dug a hole into the henhouse, and all the chicks got out. He's out of here. Wait wait! I apologize, Aunt Etta. Please don't kick him out, please. You did say this was my home, too. No, no. You do not belong here, take you and your father's stuff, - and get out of my house... - Wait, wait please! Let us stay. We like living here. - Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait... - Get out of my house! I miss dad. He'd always be with me no matter what happens. I have no one to fall back on now. Dad, she didn't do anything wrong. Don't hit her! Stop! I'm begging you. I beg you! Ryan. Where are you? Please. Ryan. Please don't leave me. I'll come back for you. Ryan, wait! Aunt Etta? Aunt Etta. Please wake up. - You are in danger. - Leave me alone! - Hello? - Hello, this is Harper Brown. Are you trying to send me to jail? No, no, please. Harper, is that you? I'm just trying to save you. You! You drove Ryan from me. No! You made me what I am. Are you okay? Aunt Etta! Do you need help? Honey, are you okay? Are you okay? Ms. Cooper? Yes. Aunt Etta is drunk. She... she really needs help. I can get someone there right now. Thank you. Milkshake Come here. I brought your favorite. This's Etta's farm. I'm not available right now. Please leave a message. Hi, Harper. This is Layla. I have a good news for you. Your aunt is a very brave woman. She's doing a great job in rehab. And I'm sure you'll see her very soon. We're just a phone call away. Okay, honey? OK. Dozen of eggs, two heads of... what it says... Check! Get out of the way! What's wrong with you? You have to pay for these vegetables. Excuse you. You're in my way. That's her! She... she's the new delivery girl. I'm not the delivery girl. My name is Harper and you guys owe me an apology. She's hurt. Liam, just say you're sorry. Who asked you! Are you OK? I'm so sorry. Liam, say something. No. I can't sell them like this, in this condition. I know some restaurants in town. They would totally take the rest. Really? Will that work? Yeah, of course. Come on. Let me help you. My father hit me all the time. And my brother abandoned me. And I was just... We were just treated like a machine with endless housework and mocked by all the other kids. And my life is just... filled with hopelessness and despair and... and alcohol is my only comfort. Thank you for sharing. Thank you. Grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change those things I can and the wisdom to know the difference. Miss Grace. Good morning, Harper. Good morning, Miss Grace. Here are your vegetables. I even added two apples on the side for you. Oh, thanks, sweetheart. You're so kind. Hey, what happened to your arm? It's just a scratch. Here you go. Thank you so much for your help. It's my pleasure. Bye, Miss Grace Have a wonderful day. Bye, Harper. Look at this poor girl. Isn't that girl from our... That's her... Hey! What's going on here? - Hey, how are you? - Nothing. Just hanging here. You've got to be kidding me! You can't honestly think this is real. She's a big fat liar. God. What do you want? There's enough in there for you to crawl back into the bottle for the rest of your life. Miss Brown, my patience is wearing thin. Keep your money. I'm not that kind of person. You can't have her. I don't think that's for you to decide. I am her mother, I can take her whenever I like. Mother? I think you gave up the chance to that title a long time ago. - I had my reasons... - Harper is not for sale! And if you try to talk to me again, you are gonna need to use that money to buy yourself a new tongue. Got it? You're gonna regret that. Try me. Hello, this is Etta's farm. How may I help you? Harper, honey. Oh, good morning, Mary. Your aunt has completed her first treatment successfully, which means she'll be back home soon. Really? Yay! Woah! Yay! Aunt Etta's coming back home. She's coming back! Hi, little guy. She's coming back! Wow, these flowers are so beautiful. Look! Look at this. Wow. Look at all of these. Aunt Etta will love them. Come on. I have to go to work. I put your lunch in the box. Oh, no, no, you don't... you don't need to rush to work. We can... we can do it together. It's OK. I'm a farm girl now. Remember? Dear Aunt Etta, I'm so proud of you. Thanks for teaching me everything, so that I could take good care of the farm while you weren't here. I missed you so much. Welcome home. I love you. Is this for me? It's old but it still works. - Want to give it a go? - Uh-huh! Oh, yeah, here you go. Okay. All right, now start off slow. You got your balance? Yep. All right. Here we go! Woo! Finally, a bike of my own! My dad had always biked me into the town. I can smell it from miles away. Wow. Easy, they're hot. Mmm! Sometimes I can't believe we're together again. You know, I... never dreamed that life could be as good as when you're in it. What's wrong? Nothing. Well then... Shall we have strawberry yogurt tonight? I just learned how to make it from the community center. And I promise... It'll be the best you've ever had Aunt Etta? Huh? Oh, yeah, sure. Hey, who's that man? And... where's he taking Ben no? I sold Ben no. We ran up a lot of debt. We need the money. You what? How could you even do that - without telling me? - Because I knew exactly ...what you would say, Harper, Okay? What do you expect me to do? Kick you out, make you sleep in the streets? Ben no is family. You can't just sell him like that. This isn't fair. Where are you go... Harper! Wait, sir. Sir, please give Ben no back, please. The horse? I just bought him. Is there anything wrong? He's my horse. What do you want kid? Sir, my name is Harper. He is Ben no. I learned to ride. And I grew up with him. I know I may cause you a lot of trouble, but please... I can't afford to lose him, I could do a lot of farm work, whatever you need me to do. Dad. The horse belongs with Harper. He's a handsome guy. You treat him well. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you Aunt Etta. I promise we'll find another way to make money. Come on. Thanks Look, you're so beautiful now, so colorful. It's alright now, Ben no. We'll be together forever. Aunt Etta! Aunt Etta! Okay. I want to take a shot at this. The winner could get five hundred dollars. That could really help us. Right? You're sweet. Well, you made your choice, now you gotta work for it. OK. OK, thank you, Aunt Etta. Woohoo! Hey, this is your first contest. I believe in you. Thank you, Aunt Etta. You know, music... might not always be your passion, but whatever it is, you've got to fight for it, no matter what. Come on, I got something to show you. You're almost getting as good at that thing as Ryan was. That's the first time I've heard you mention him. He was... my lighthouse in the dark. I miss him a lot. Well, you won't ever feel lonely again now that you got me. Lucas, is that you? Yeah. Come on. Keep it up! You got this. Yeah. Woo! Come on! Yeah! It's actually working. What do you want to be when you grow up? I don't know. I guess I haven't really thought about it yet. You? I want to be an astronaut. Or maybe a deep sea diver. Wow. The highest highs and the lowest lows. You choose two extremes. No one said we couldn't. I'm... I'm going to move soon. You're kidding. When? It's the first flight out next week. So you... can't come see me at the contest? No. Hi, everyone. My name is Harper. Here's a song that I wrote called... "Back to School". Here we go... Good day, Miss Brown. I'm Ms. Stevens' attorney. You can call me Sam. We're just here to speak with you on Ms. Steven's behalf about Harper. Well, I should tell you that the court is on the verge of granting Ms. Stevens request formally. It means you are no longer retain custody of Harper. Miss Brown. This is a good thing for Harper. Ms. Stevens will take good care of her daughter. You may want to look these over. Why can't she come to talk to me herself about this? Ms. Stevens is very busy, that's why she has us to represent her. And do you care that she abandoned her daughter? Ms. Stevens is not the person that you think she is. She is a kid. She needs friends, knowledge and outside world like the others, a normal and healthy child. You could not possibly provide all of that for her, can you? How do you know that I couldn't. This is none of your business. Harper deserves a better life. And Mrs. Stevens can provide that for her. Harper is Mrs. Stevens daughter. I'm pretty sure that her love for Harper will only be deeper than yours, as only a mother's can be. If you really love Harper, then you know what you have to do. Don't make this harder than it has to be. Hello, Miss. May I help you? Oh, no, thank you. - Harper deserves a better life. - If you really love Harper then you know what you have to do. - And Ms. Stevens can provide that for her. I got you. Don't worry. Keep moving. I want to go back down. Oh, come on. The best view is yet to come. Don't give up so easily. But... Believing in yourself is half the battle. Let's keep moving. We're almost there. - But I don't want to go... - Yes, you do. It's going to be worth it. One, two, three. - Say "cheese"... - Cheese. Are we going on a trip? What happened? Are you okay? Harper, I need to tell you something. Your mother came to find you. My mother? Yeah. You need to go live with her. She is the one person in the world that you really belong to, even if you've never met her. Are you going to come with me? No way. I'm not leaving you. The court is on her side. I don't care! How did she even know that I was here? I mean... I have the right to choose. Right? - I choose to stay here to live with you... - No, Harper. Harper. Come on, listen to me. The world outside is so beautiful. You can't stay here forever. You need friends and a good school and a normal life, and I can't give you those things. But she can. I don't want that life. Have you ever asked how I feel... what I want? Do my feelings ever matter to you? And I don't care if she came back or not. She left me. My father's gone. Now you are leaving me, too? Do you really think this is what I deserve? You're all the same! Stop! Don't go back to that. The stuff is packed. Go to your room. I'm taking you to your mother's in the morning. But you can't have that stuff. I can't afford to support you. I don't want to see you. I don't want you in my life! So... You are... really letting me go. When I came here, I was just looking for a place to belong. But you were the one who gave me a home. This belongs to you as much as it does to me. I hope that this will help with debt. And I love you, Harper. You're the only family I got left. Come on, Max. You want to help? Thank you, Max. Wow. Look Max. This is our new home. I know this isn't much. But things won't always be so hard for us. Right? I promise. Here, Max. Have some bread. Another one? Good boy. Max, we got the food for today. Come on, Max. Ah! Come on, Max. You're only hurt a little bit. I wish that none of this ever happened. Wow! Look, Max! Look! We got one! Look, Max. Another one. Yeah? Catch! Oh! Alright, I'm gonna come back down. Look, Max, look at all of them. We've got so many. Come here. Come on, Max. Come on, Max. Wait, Max. Wait. We gotta go. Come on. Follow me. Max! Hey! Hey! Max. Oh! Max! Wait, no! Max! Max, come back! Max! Max! There's a wolf! Please! Ah! Max! Ah! Max! Come back and, and save me, please! Oh! Max! Max! Max, please! Max! Ah! Easy, easy. You're okay. You're okay. I'm sorry. I just... don't want to go anywhere else without you. Oh, come here. I'm not going anywhere. I'll visit as much as I can, okay? You promise? Promise. It really is different here. This is the reception room. Reception room? This is Ms. Stevens. Your bedroom is upstairs, right next to Ms. Stevens' room. This is our wonderful dining room, our beautiful sitting space, and it's all a part of our majestic manor. Now come, come, come up, I have more to show you... Wow! This is so beautiful. I heard you're a great lover of music. Ms. Stevens has prepared music courses for you. You're going to love them! Take a good rest, Miss Harper. I won't disturb you. Hello there. Can I help you with that? I didn't think you'd have an interest in this kind of stuff. I used to help my aunt with this kind of stuff all the time. I'm sorry, but you don't have to do all this. It's okay. Trust me. I'm really good at this stuff. Let me help. I'm sure you can, but... I would lose my job if Mr. Jenkins found out about it. I'm sorry about that. - It's okay. - Okay. - Bye. - Bye. Smells good. Good evening, Miss Harper. I'm Miss Luna. I run the kitchen here. Today's menu is baked chicken, carrots and asparagus. And a garden salad. Aunt Etta did say I should eat more carrots. Yes. Carrots are great and healthy. Good for the eyes, too. Not bad. Ms. Stevens has customized a menu for you, and made sure that it changes completely day by day. Do you know where she is, Ms. Stevens? Why hasn't she come back yet? I wouldn't know much about that. You can ask Mr. Jenkins. He knows more about Ms. Stevens' schedule. He can keep you updated. Thank you, Miss Luna. You must be working hard right now on the farm. Miss Harper. Ms. Stevens will be home soon, get ready and come with me. Oh. Oh, Harper, my dear daughter. Oh, finally. Look at you! You are so very beautiful, my darling. You are truly a Stevens girl now. You will never know how much I love you. Okay, smile, darling. Those are the most famous photographers in town. - Smile. - Over here, over here! Oh, Jenkins. I am going to make you into the most beautiful lady in the world, like your mother before you. Okay, ta-ta now. Bye bye. Yes. Smile. Don't move. You're beautiful. Ms. Stevens. Ms. Stevens? I am your mother. Please call me mother, dear Harper. Mo-Miss Stevens. Fine. I should give you more time to get used to your new life, and a new identity. Perhaps you would do well with a new name. Well, this is the name that my dad gave me. 'Harper' means 'brave'. Aunt Etta likes the name, too. Of course, dear. Perhaps in due time, you'll change your mind. Oh, this is a gift for you. Oh, a gift? Oh, dear me, a gift from my... precious daughter. Do you like it? Harper, I don't want to re-live the past. It would do you well, too if you left it behind, and just embraced the future. But... what about dad? Please don't ever mention your father in front of me again. He let me down. I was young and naive and thought he could... fit into my life, but he failed me. - Did he do anything wrong... - That's enough of that! Memory lane is officially closed. What's that? Oh, this is another gift for you. These colors represent happiness and reminiscence. Put those away this instant. We Stevens women never, and I mean never wear plastic Schedule? You start on the golf course tomorrow. I've never played golf before. Harper, dear, you are my daughter. I'm going to make you into a world-class celebrity and ultimately... my successor. Successor? You will understand soon enough. Get some rest. You've had a long day. Jenkins. Yes, ma'am. Lucy. This is the Stevens residence. Who is this? Hi, it's Etta. Can I speak to Harper? I'm sorry, Miss Harper is in class at the moment and can not be disturbed. How is she doing? Watch your tempo and speed. And slowly... and whing! Try again. I think this suit is too tight. You need more exercise and a healthy diet. You eat too much junk food, don't you? Come on, faster, faster, faster. What are you doing? Let's go. Last one. Come on, Harper! Come on. Get it! Let's go! Faster, Harper! Faster! Continue! Continue! Continue! Continue. I'll tell you. Continue, continue, Harper, continue! Come on. I could swim faster than that when I was her age. I'm sure you could. Hello? Aunt Etta. Harper, are you alright? Oh, I'm so tired. I can't... I can't hold on any longer. I miss you and Max so much. I want to go back... It's late. Go to your bed and sleep. Something must be wrong. Come on, Max. Ugh! Dear dad, I went from Aunt Etta's house to live with my mother. She's... way different than I thought she'd be. Dear Aunt Etta, the house I live in now is huge, but... I liked our little house together more. I miss you so much... Get out of bed now. I was more diligent than you when I was your age. You have a singing class this morning. Come on. I never asked for a lousy singing class. Excuse me? I don't know what that woman was teaching you in her house. But here we have a little thing called manners, young lady. Now, I've booked you the best singing teacher, and she's very strict. So don't be late. See you downstairs. Thank you so much, sir. Not at all, Miss. Have an enjoyable lesson. Yi... Yi... Open your mouth. Open. Long. Relax your tongue. Now sing! Y-Yi... Continue. We're not done. Can we go rest now? Dance hall, please. More. More. Chin down. Shoulders down. Arm in first. Soft, elegant fingers. Here we go. First position, turn out and... we plié, and up, plié. And up! Back straight. Turn and turn and turn. Oh, try it again. You could do this. Here we go, back straight. Five, six. Here we go. And turn and turn and turn and turn. Harper. Harper. Max. Max... Ben no... Ben... Woah, woah, woah! Slow down. Wait. Come back! Oh, my goodness, Harper, how many times must I say it? Come on now. If you don't listen to my rules, you will pay the price! Follow the rules! Follow the rules! Follow the rules! One more lap, Harper. One more lap Open your mouth! Open your mouth! Open your mouth! You belong to me. No, no! You belong to me. Me, me! Me! OK, sweetie. Well, she does have a slight fever, possibly from being overworked. She's very tired. What she needs is rest the most, please. I want to call Aunt Etta. She must be very busy. We'll talk about this later. But... I have something I want to tell her. Looks like I need to send you to boarding school. To where? A school for ungrateful, misbehaving children like yourself. Then you can be their problem. No, how could you even say that? Where are you going? Hey, come back here. Your rampant bad behavior is beyond my means, Harper. I need professionals to teach you how to follow the rules and become a proper lady. I don't want to be like those kids. I especially don't want to be a person like you. I am your mother, Harper, and I am doing this for your own good. My mother? Where were you when I needed you the most? Where were you when I was sick. Where were you... when I was dropped off at the community center and the other kids mocked me. Where were you... when dad died. For my own good? You are the most selfish person I know. You're only doing this for yourself. You're as arrogant and incorrigible... as your father! Ah! You little monster, you... Get out of here! Max? Max! Harper! Harper! Thank you! People in my life have come and gone. You never know what to expect in your next path. This summer I learned to go forth with courage and embrace everything that makes you who you are, then maybe, just maybe, you'll end up exactly where you belong. Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
