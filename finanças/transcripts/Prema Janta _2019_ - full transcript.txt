PREMA JANTA [LOVE COUPLE] These lovers are example for true love. Parents have parted the love couple. Love couples are cursed by castes. Lovers committed suicide in fear of marriage denial by parents. Suicides of love couples have crossed 1000 in the year. Boyfriend committed suicide for the girlfriend. Their deaths conceived as suicides rather murders. What a plan! Send that video to sir via Whatsapp. Okay. But, how can a father kill his own son? I was not there when this was happening. What made him to kill his own son? As you assume, this guy is not his son. This guy's father has died in his childhood. His mother was married to another man. This guy loved a girl and asked for her property. That is what happened. Our boss killed him for wealth, and that guy was not his son. Leave it be. Did you send him the video or not? Yeah, I did. You killed our son? -Yes. How inhumane are you to kill our son? -Shut up, you lame bitch. If you let our daughter know this, I will kill you both. Just stay away. You didn't raise the son well. At least raise our daughter well. I LOVE YOU! Wait, dude. Did he again dream of that girl proposing him? You faulty brat! You wasted my flour. I toiled to winnow jowar. You ruined my hard work. Something's messed up I guess. Did my mother start yelling again? The prices have gone up. Who will pay for this? She won't change. You parents passed away happily and burdened us with you. It's been a waste to feed you. Moreover your craziness has resulted this. I will not feed for you the day. Go and beg for alms . Hey, shut up! What's that nonsense with our future son-in-law? To whom will he be son-in-law? His interest in styling seems like he might bring a girl to home directly. His mother, who is your sister, has eloped with a guy and burdened us with him. Parents habits are inherited undoubtedly. He neither is rich nor has anyone. Considering what should I marry off my daughter to him? Mother, enough! Go inside. I'm the earner in the home. What's the loss for you? Have you brought anything from your home? Not even a single penny. Bragging like your wealth is melting away. As you were insufficient for yourself, you've come as second wife to me. Continue whining. I lost my peace at home because of him. Such men stay at home without any shame. I wish he could get away at least. You knew that my mother yells at everything. Why are you crying then? Calm down, dude. I feel like leaving home. I'm thinking to find some work and stay there. Stop it! Listen! Haven't we taken your farm after your mother died? Otherwise we wouldn't have any farm. Until recently, my mother used to go out for work. After getting your farm, she was able to be at home, and got cocky. Stop minding all these. Don't think anything stupid. Come, let's go. Get up. I will not come. Jaffar promised to teach me driving auto rickshaw. I will earn from it and stay outside. Our Jaffar? -Yes. He is not Jaffar but a rogue. You believe him? We cannot trust him. Alright. Tell me something. Why did the flour fall? You assumed that girl proposing you again, right? But, this doesn't seem admiring. Even in dreams you expect that girl to propose you? Don't you dare to propose her in dreams? Your fear won't get you anything. I don't mind what you feel. You smiled? I came to know what's your weakness. In case you plan to leave home, don't go with empty hands. You have to hold Nandu's hands and leave. Try to get a seat in IIIT as she said. Study in that college for six years. After that get a good job and get married. Till then I will give you my full support. Just don't mind my mother's yelling and Jaffar's ill-advice. Okay. You know what? Tenth class exam results will be out today. They indeed are your love results. If you rank 1st in mandal zone then you will study in IIIT for six years. Hey, it's Jaffar. Where you have been? I was searching for you. Our tenth class results will be out today. "Our?" Those are our tenth class results. Not only you, even I have written the exams. Not written. You have been writing for six years. Even after getting age-barred. Call me anything but not age-barred. What else do we call an age-barred guy? What will you do if you pass? Just keep riding the auto. I dream of going to college and enjoying the college life. Hey, will you pass the examination for this time? For sure. You told me the same last time. You won't believe me, I got quite a lenient invigilator this time. I copied a lot. I will pass this time undoubtedly. As expected it's a long queue. Hey, Where are you going? Follow the queue. I work here. -Okay, go. Who is lying there? Have you lost your senses? Every working official is here. Quietly follow the line. Bloody! Come back. Just joked. You passed in exams. You too have passed. Dude, my neighbour girl passed in exams. If I fail I will lose my respect in home. What shall we do now? You have passed. Girls are succeeding, what about us? You passed in exams. You got failed. Let it be. My life has been confined to worship in temple. You are held for malpractice. You have to wait for ten more days to get your results. Move. -Move aside. Everyone is worried for tenth results. But he has to worry about his love too. Get lost. You ranked first in district. "Delightful!" "It's delightful to be with you." "It's delightful to dream with you." "My rush towards your cute expressions is delightful." "My hurry towards your voice is delightful." "My victory towards your smiling desires is delightful." "The seven holy footsteps towards your walking feet are delightful." "It's delightful to be with you." "It's delightful to dream with you." "First sight is delightful." "First smile is delightful." "First love is delightful." "First talk is delightful." "First game is delightful." "It's delightful if first love works out." "For the first time I myself felt delightful because of you." "The meaning of first love is delightful." "This illusion is delightful." "This joy is delightful." "My every day and night is delightful." "My age is delightful." "Your pair is delightful." "My everyday is delightful." "This stupor is yours." "Your world is delightful." "The day of pairing with you is delightful." Brother! Brother! I've sent your brother to the city. Why are you asking for him? I ranked second in tenth class examinations in our district. You boast like you got a first rank. Go to your room. Go. Father! I would get a seat if applied in IIIT. Can you get me an application form? End your studies at once. These girls doesn't need any education. Just nod your head, I will marry her off to my son. It will be done soon. I will see for an auspicious day. Dear, you must eat well and put on some weight. Otherwise, my son would seem fat to others. I'm willing to study further, father. To do what? You have to marry him anyhow. That's why I wish to send you now. Now, get inside. She is just a kid. What's hurry to marry her off now? Hey, stop countering me. I don't tolerate such arguments. Get inside. You see for an auspicious day. Hey, don't overindulge in eating and become fat. Stay in control. Somehow, I will marry her to you. So that we can get all this wealth. Understand? We don't have to pay any fee if I join IIIT. We can study there for six years for free if we get a seat. Six years? You sound like it's just six days? You think we are rich? There's nothing you can do by studying. Stop everything and find a work. Mother! That is a government college. They offer scholarships to students. He isn't aware of those. Stop blabbering. I don't care all those. He better find some work and earn some money. Otherwise, I won't tolerate. I don't understand such things. But, I will ask who is aware of it. Just wait for a day. Okay, uncle. Bloody hell! Don't know which girl will be my classmate. If they know that I ride auto rickshaw, no girl wishes to look at me. As if every girl is behind you now. I cannot survive without running this auto rickshaw. But If I run this, I will lose my respect. Dude, customers are coming. Your number is next, go ahead. She seems like Chandu's girlfriend. Hop in. Where to? To temple. -Okay, come in. Is this the time to go to a temple? I asked you to come in the morning. But you came now. I have set an alarm. It rang. I turned it off and thought to wake up after five minutes. But it slept for more time. Leave it be. Did you apply for IIIT or not? No. My father is denying. He is willing to drop my studies and marry me off to my uncle's son. Marriage? At this young age? Encouraging minor marriage is a crime. Hey, why do you care? Mind your own business. What's this? Is it right to drop off studies after ranking top? If you don't mind, I have an advice. If joining IIIT is not possible then go for local colleges. I will inform the same to my friend. Who is your friend? What will you inform him? I mean... I will talk to your father. After all, making a clever student to drop studies is unfair. It's unnecessary for you. Stop the auto. Okay. Should I wait to take you return? No need. You can go. You think I would wait? I will rush to Chandu and tell him everything. What happened? What that hurry as if someone died? It's really that important. What happened? I just rushed here after dropping off your lover at the temple. Which temple? Let's go. First listen what I had to say. You topped first rank and cracked seat in IIIT for her. But her parents are planning to drop her studies and marry her off. I heard all of this while they were talking in my auto. It's better to forget her. Don't be sad. What can we do if fate is against us? You could get more better girl for your talent. No. We must do something to stop it. They are about to see an auspicious day. What else can we do now? I have an idea. Who will set an auspicious day? Our Sharma's father. First, we must manage Sharma. I'm very happy to see friends who are struggling to get a girl educated. Compared to your struggle, cannot I do such small favour? However, my father is out of village and will return in a week. You get going. I will take care. Hey, he is coming. Go and hide. -Let's hide. What do you want? Where is you father? He's not there. Why? Alright, I will come later. Wait. What's so hurry? My father will be back in a week. If you want to set an auspicious day then I can. Can you set it properly? Of course, I do. My father is good at seeing old astrology. But he seeks my advice for modern astrology. Is there such thing as modern astrology? If technology can be updated, astrology too can. What's the relation between those two? You are here to speak about your son. Am I right? How do you know? That is called modern astrology. -Really? You can turn back if you don't believe me. No, I'm okay with it. Tell me. As per your son's astrology, he is impotent to marry for a year. He is scared to tell you this. So, does it get well after a year? Does he get potency? I will tell you that after a year. You are able to think in all aspects at such young age. No matter what, you will become as great as your father. Eat well. I still can bring more if you want. Did you set an auspicious day for marriage? I feel... that we should set the marriage a year later. You yourself went out to set an auspicious day from the priest. What happened now? Our scriptures suggest us to not conduct any marriages within the year of someone's demise. Those scriptures suggest us to conduct marriages if we perform final rites. If needed we can perform the final rites of demised. But let's not postpone the marriage for some vague reason. If you have something then be honest. No, there isn't such thing. Any marriage demands the couple to live together forever. And for it to happen... I feel it's best to wait for a year. Your wish. Find an auspicious day after a year. Okay. Father, can I take admission in the college? See, she wants to study for postponing the marriage. Forget studies. Be at home and learn how to cook. Let her go, brother-in-law. What she will do staying at home for a year? Rather joining her in IIIT college, let us join her in local college. Alright, your wish. Brother-in-law seems happy today. Heroines are coming. Take us to Nalanda College. I knew where you want to go. -You again? We will find another auto. I just joked. Come, I will take you. Chandu will fly high with excitement from today. God helps the sufferers. -Better, shut up and drive. Dude, our plan worked. You will throw a party if you listen what I have to say. Nandu has taken admission in Nalanda college. Shit! How can we join in that college? Aunt won't agree to pay fee for it. Dude! Toppers get free seat in any college. I guess Nandu too has got a free seat. Then let's join the college today itself. Okay. All the best. Don't be scared as in tenth class. Do you get it? -Yeah. Now go home and convince your aunt. Hey, always busy looking yourself in mirror? Come and eat along. Mind me not. Continue eating. Son-in-law, I just enquired and understood that you can join in that college. When do you plan to join in IIIT? Uncle, even I've enquired after listening to Aunt. The fee there is pretty high. That's why I changed my mind to join Nalanda college in Adilabad. Choosing private college over government college? You think it's easy to pay fee? Mother! College will offer free seat for the toppers. There is no need to pay any fee. Then why are you studying? You could have studied well and got a free seat, right? To hell with me! I'm getting feelings on every girl after passing tenth class. Girls have more feelings than us. But they hide their feelings, and we express. Such a big college building! Even the students will come from rich families. Dude, our schoolmate, Rohith too joined here. A girl named Nandu will arrive now. No one should dare to even look at her. I'm warning you. I'm not responsible if something goes wrong. "Our relation brought us together after waiting for so long." "My first joy is not a dream but a reality." Nandu must be our Bi.P.C group. Where is MPC class room? Second floor. -Thank you. I have been warning you. Didn't you hear me? Hello! Cut off your cockiness,. I'm talking to him. Who are you? -Inter first year, MPC. Studying at late age? Speak whatever but don't bring age in between. -Get lost! We know you for long time. What did you do for Nandu? I know her since my tenth. I planned to study in Hyderabad. But joined here just for her. Isn't his enough to show how interested I'm on her? Do you know what my friend did then? He ranked first in district in tenth just for her. He let go off a free seat in IIIT college. Leave it be. -Wait! It doesn't matter who did what for her. What matters is to whom she will fall in love with. Nandu's seems more of Miss Andhra and Miss India level. Such top level girl falling for you is mere impossible. Many have written exams, but my friend scored first among them. The same applies here. Be it top rank or top level girl, it will fall for him. Enough! Move now. Feeling jealous! Get lost. Sir is coming! Everyone sit down. Move, idiot! Greetings sir! You feel yourselves as kids still? Lagging to even greet. Now that you've come to intermediate, a decent Good Morning would do. Good Morning sir! Good. Now sit down! Thank you, sir! Dear students, welcome to Intermediate! I'm Nikhilesh, your mathematics lecturer. Dear, your name is Nandini, right? Yes, sir. I have seen you on the newspaper. You ranked second right? Yes, sir. You could have joined in IIIT, right? Why did you join here? I have another goal, sir. Sir, even my friend ranked first in district. Oh! There are two toppers in our class. Nandini has a goal to be here. What about you? He wants to be her husband. Shut up! I too have a goal, sir. Wow, sit down! So, there are two district toppers in our class. I didn't join IIIT because of issues at home. What made him to not join IIIT? Holy shit! Don't involve me in such things. He may tell you that he joined here for you. How would I know? Please, don't disturb me. Rohith has changed course from Bi.P.C to MPC. Forget him. Look, Nandu is coming. See, how Chandu is staring at her. Nandu has got good impression upon him the first day itself. If you keep quiet, things get hard to deal. See, how I will book him in front of Nandu. What will you do? Wait and see. Did you find any girl attractive? I like that green dress girl. That bumpy nose girl? Hello Nandu, just a minute. What's he up to? -Who knows! Yes. A guy in our college is spreading rumors on you. On me? Who is that guy? There he is. He is showing us. Is he mad or what? He is telling that he loves you and secured first rank in district for you. He is wanting us to believe it. He is warning everyone. What a waste guy! I'm informing you so that you would control him. Listen, a guy spreading rumors and you carrying it to me is shit. Thanks. I don't care all such fuss. Now, you can mind your business. Dude, he booked us. Yes. Hey! What are you doing here? Get lost! I don't understand what you are doing. Why are you highlighting him now? You felt that Nandu got his impression the very first day. I started conversing with her by speaking against him. If I manage to build a relation with her, then she may fall for me by looking at my star level maintenance. It's a shitty plan. What if she falls for him? All your plans seem pitiful. Hey, what are you doing here? Move now. His nuisance has become more in the college. I find this group overdoing in this batch. Hey, age-barred! It's all because of you. Nandu came to know all of this. By the way, why did he tell her about us? Don't worry. I'll take care if something goes wrong. First day of college brought me proposals and jealousies. Then what's coming next might be a war. He secured district first rank for me? Shall we enquire about it? What's the use? He followed me all the year, became topper, and wanted to join IIIT to impress me. He again dropped joining IIIT as I didn't. How much he must be loving me to do all those? It's a sin to ignore such a loving person. Disgusting! Confess that you like him. Whatever! What if he really did all those for me? Enough! My neighbour aunt works as clerk in our school. I'll find the truth. Really? Then find out. Why are you so happy? It's for you. I found out Chandu's details. What's the matter? What Rohith spoke to you is true. Chandu is from our school. We couldn't get to know him as ours isn't co-education. He never ranked first in his class. That's why everyone's wondering how did he secure first rank in district. They are watching us from the stairs. So, what Rohith told us are truths then. Absolutely. She came to know about us. What to do now? He has applied for IIIT. But he cancelled it later. Hi! -Hi! She is gorgeous even from the back. What's the discussion here? Move to classes. They started bragging even before the freshers party. God knows what they turn into after freshers party. "Yesterdays kids... "...became heroes today." "Those who wore briefs alone till yesterday... "...are posing like stars today." "Yesterdays kids... "...became heroes today." "Those who wore briefs alone till yesterday... "...are posing like stars today." "Tender moustaches, gutsy angers have sprung in intermediate life." "Girls to the one side..." "Boys to the other side..." "They are not friends yet they panic to face each other." "Inter books to the one side..." "Cunning looks the other side..." "Parents worry on what they would become in the end..." "Idiots are unknown..." "Intelligents are unknown..." "But the common ground for them is Intermediate life." "Annoying each other in classrooms..." "Keeping discussions at the canteen..." "They cheer at the stupid acts in the campus." "They bring double meaning conversations..." "They show two feelings at once..." "College for teens is the home for noisy commotions." "Many unknown doubts..." "Yet they don't try to express..." "The common centre for confusion is Intermediate life." "They are just kids." "Are they really heroes?" "I will pull off their briefs." "Enough it." Can I call Nandu as sister? Sister has come. I insisted you to not interfere. See, you made them get closer. He is really overdoing in this matter. I have to teach him a lesson. Find him alone anywhere. I have to go. Move. Why are you overacting in front of Nandu? You told me that Nandu belongs to whom she loves. Are you afraid that Nandu might fall for me? Fear didn't exist in my history. Leave history. Let's get this done ourselves. Really? Guys, he scared. What will you do? Beat me? Beat me. Come on, beat me. You are that gutsy? Beat me then. Come on. Nandu has come. Dude, Nandu has come. What are you doing there? I'm working alone here. Continue then. -Help me here. See, how mad he has become, staring at the chain. Daily you travel in my auto for free. Bloody rickety auto. Always lands into a repair. Then ask your dad to buy me a new one. Keep wishing! Fix it. Bloody age-barred punk! Don't ever call me age-barred! I will hit you with this. Shut up and fix it. Dude, she taught him a nice lesson. That scoundrel will not show up for another month. Brother-in-law, Haven't you understood anything of her action? What have you understood? Dude, she tied Rakhi to him after knowing that he had hit you. Why didn't she tie it to you? What's the implication behind this? As he was torturing her, she tied it to him in the class. If I do the same, she will tie it to me too. Oh, really? You took it that way? You keep thinking like that. One day she will tie Rakhi to you too. Everything will get over then. Confess to her if you love her. If will look ugly if the girl you loved ties rakhi to you. If you are scared then tell me, I will talk to her. Don't do anything stupid. I will confess to her. How can we know what Nandu's been thinking about me? How long will you hold it? You think girls express by themselves if they love someone? They just give you signals by winking or smiling at you. We have to understand by that. Dude! -Yes. Your lover is coming this way. Must be to tie Rakhi to you. We are dead. Wait, I'm coming. She has gone. You think she saw us? She went off. She didn't notice us. We are safe. You get it? We are afraid to even face her? How can we approach her and propose? But still, why am I scared to see her? Dude, this time I won't be scared to face her. It's a challenge. I've been observing you. I heard that you are spreading rumors on me? Me? No, not at all. You picked up that fight for me? No. Then why are you running off from me? Why are you afraid of me? I'm not afraid. Remember one thing. Cowards should not desire anything, be it girl or anything. To be harsh, you shouldn't be afraid even though it is. Okay. Tell me if there's something. Don't worry about the consequence. But if you lay back in fear, you won't achieve anything. If you're afraid to confess directly then you can do it over phone call. We must find her land phone number. Score is 30. No brother, it's 26. Don't lie. How much two sixes and one four add up to? Not 30? You are lying. How much 22 plus 4 is? Not 26? Alright! Throw the ball now, I will hit six. Oh God! What does he eat everyday? That kid is coming towards us. Don't leave her without knowing the number. See my talent now. Hey, look there! Ask her. You want the ball? Do you have it? No. But why is your brother saying that you are weak at calculations? I'm good at it than him. If so then I'll put a test. If you pass in it then I'll buy you a new ball. What's it? So, you're good at mathematics? -Yes. So, you remember everything? -Yes, ask me. Alright! How much is one plus one? Hey, dumb! You think I'm in Kindergarten? Ask me tough questions. How many balls does an over consist? -Six. How much did your brother score in 1st over? Ten. Who all does carry phones in your home? My uncle and father have one each. My mother has a landline. Do you remember landline's number? -I do. Tell me once. I shouldn't say it. There are girls in the home. You think of calling us? I don't need your ball. What the heck? Brother, I couldn't find the ball. Go search it. That fat guy is coming here. I cannot handle this. Wait! I'll take care of him. Ask him. What are you searching for? Brother! I lost my ball. Stop searching for it. Tell me something. I'll buy you a new one. Just back you sister has said to me that you are poor at mathematics and cannot remember anything. Stupid girl! She doesn't remember anything. So, you remember everything then? -Yes, everything. Even telephone numbers too? -Yes. If so then tell me your uncle's phone number. What about landline? How insane! They got it. I wrote everything. Let's go. Is this ball yours? -Yes. Take it. Bye. -Bye. Hello, you promised me to buy a new one? You already have one. Why do you need new ball? Get lost. One day will be mine. I will take revenge then. What will you speak to him if they call you? Will think about it. Let's go. I love you! I love you! Worst! You are behaving like a rogue. -What happened? Does this way seems awkward? You wish to say 'I love You' as the first thing in phone? She asked me confess over phone if I'm afraid to confront in person. What else can we do? That's not how you deal it. -Then? That is a landline, not a cellphone. If someone else lifts the phone then we are dead. First see who took up the call and then proceed. If your girl lifts the call then see what she had to say and then confess. You are afraid to talk to her directly. At least dare to talk over phone. Hey, keep your superstitions aside. Our main priest has returned. Go and seek his advice. If I had a lover who encouraged like this, I would have confessed in person. Call her first. Even I don't mind all such things. But for marriage... -You're repeating the same? Hello! Who is that? Who is speaking? Shit! I don't believe all those. Will you ask him or should I? I will speak to him. -Okay. Inform about it tomorrow. Dear, I adviced you to eat well. Are you following it? God knows how you eat. Call her this time. Call now. It's ringing. Lift the call. Speak up. Confess her quickly. What a coward! -Tell her. I found your phone number. You told me to confess over phone. You wanted to say something, I guess. What's it? Tell it. -Tell it. Don't waste time. Tell her. -I love you. What happened? She hung up the call. -Really? Yes. It's all because of you. I tried to help you. We will get to know once we see her face tomorrow. We cannot understand these girls. Does someone propose on their first call itself? Enough! You forced me to confess and now you're turning a blind eye? Wait! You do what I say? Did you lose your brain like me? -Why did you give me brainless ideas? You must express your love. You said her face tells everything? There's nothing to understand. She didn't even see us. Faces of women have different meanings. Let's go. She's coming. See keenly. You might understand something. We cannot decipher. Have you seen the film 'Idiot'? -I've watched it 12 times. Do you remember the famous dialogue from it? What's it? The scene where Ravi Teja asks heroine. Asked what? The scene where he asks, "Suchi! What have you decided?" Meanwhile lecturer intervenes and asks the hero,"What did you ask?" By the way, what are you talking mister? I didn't see you coming, sir. Took me as attender? Called me, sir? Hey, get lost. Hey, you always take such films as inspiration, but have you ever taken films like Swayam Krushi as inspiration? Dear boys, I've to say something. If you focus on girls now, their beloved people start chasing you to beat. Rather, if you get yourself a high paid job, more better girls and their families will fall at you to marry their daughter. Know the value of men, idiots. Sit down. Everyone feels themselves as heroes in front of girls. But everyone fails to answer even to a simple question. Idiots! Hey you, get up! Tell me the formula for (A+B)^2. I love you. Where to? He got hurt. Are you mad? Why are you confusing him? Tell him directly if you like him. Don't waste time. Chandu cannot dare to propose you. You yourself confess to him. Don't mind it, dude. Want Samosa? -No! Give two samosas. Divya! Do early morning dreams come true? I guess so. Are you getting any dreams? Sit down! Wait. Will listen to them. Yes. Recently, I'm getting the same dream everyday. Really? What is it? It's that on my birthday, some guy in white dress is coming on horse to our ground and proposing me with a rose. You think my dream would come true? Wait till your birthday. Will see what happens. By the way, when is your birthday? It's tomorrow. So your waiting will come to end then. Let's see whether your dream comes true tomorrow. "Our hearts have synced." "The love between them has flourished." "We are the love birds that are dwelling in their fondness." "Here is a love couple running hastily for no reason." "Here is a love couple running in haze." "Desperation to meet." "Hesitations come uninvited." "This love doesn't need any introduction." "Mornings are full of joys." "Worries lay in the evenings." "The moment we part, my mind muddles." "To bless our love..." "Let's ask the Gods to prosper our love for years to come." "My love springs at first light..." "My heart starts to throb for you..." "I feel to be beside you every time." "A small mistake surrounds the mind." "It worries about you." "I feel like sharing every matter with you." "Dear, I promise you that I will be with you forever." "My love is the witness for it." "Here is a love couple running hastily for no reason." "Here is a love couple running in haze." How much of the profit you made this year? Without rains we cannot expect it. Greetings Rao, sir! -Greetings! Why is this beard man coming this way? Are you for hire? -Where to, uncle? You seem elder than me and calling me as uncle? Sorry for that. Where to? -To temple. Oh, the main priest. I shouldn't run to him. I should manage somehow to escape. Hope this beard man doesn't notice him. He seems like the priest. Sir! Hey, stop the auto. Temple is far ahead, sir. Cannot you hear? Stop the auto. Roads are unwell, sir. I will stop in the front. Stop the auto. I will stop at a few distance, sir. -Sir, wait. We are doomed now. Sir! Greetings to you! Sir, how are you? Everyone's doing well? Father, I've to go to toilet. Let's go. Wait! You were alright till now. Father, I feel like shitting here. You went to shit twice in the morning. Why are you getting it now again? Let him go. He keeps irritating me. You tell me the matter. You want to kill us? Chandu, come fast. -What happened? Will you not attend college today? -Leave it. First, come with me. What happened? Where is Nandu? -She is there. Nandu, come with me. It's urgent. What happened? Come where? -First, come with me. I'll tell you. Get in. Has he gone insane? What happened? Tell us. Where are you taking us? What shall we do now? You don't get any better chance. Without thinking much, just take her to somewhere and live happily. My parents would make me drop my studies if I go home now. They would speed up my marriage. I'm scared, Chandu. Let's go somewhere. I feel it's correct to take her away. If you leave her then you will miss her forever. First, we must think of a place to stay. I know a friend in Karimnagar. You reach there, I will inform him. There are my relatives in Karimnagar. Let's not go there. Then Hyderabad is safe. None can identify you. Don't worry about money. I've Rs.20,000. I will get them. Then hurry up now! Hey, come! You seem like a buffoon, but you're kind. You love me, right? We are the next couple. Be ready to run away. I will kill you. \Shut up and drive. Then stop praising me! Wait! I'll be back. Someone might identify us if we stand here. Shall we sit somewhere hidden? We can sit there. Come! I will not come. There's no one. I'm afraid. Don't fear for everything. Come! No. It's okay, come. I'm scared. -I'll take care. Hey! Hey! Chandu, no! Don't do anything. Who are you? Please, stop it. Chandu! Drag her! No! No! Save me! No! Help me! What happened? Nandu, sir! We were patrolling there, so we rescued her. Father, please! Enough now! This is Police station, not your home. Take care of such things at home. I warned you that he would become vagrant like his mother. He rebukes at me for scolding him. You were elated to marry your daughter to him. Now, tell me what you want to do. Ugly punk! None would come forward to marry my daughter after seeing him in my home. Decide whether I should stay or him. Tell me what you decide. Father, forgive him for this time. Get out of my home. I will kill you if you come near. Disobedient dog! Get lost! People are afraid of having daughters because of persons like you. I wouldn't have these torments if I had killed you at birth. What is my sin? Your brother and you have ruined me. Stop showing your masculinity. You killed our son earlier and you want to kill her too? I will kill you both. You are spoiling my reputation. Stop it, brother-in-law! -Don't stop me. Leave! Control your anger. I will speak to them. What will you speak? Leave me! I will kill them today. You want to be alone after killing everyone? Wait! I'll speak to them. It's not good to waste any time further. We have to conduct their marriage in two days. I'll look after the arrangements. Don't think of anything. Be calm. Till then the girl stays in my home. Come, sister. Bring her. Are you mad? What's need for love at this age? Infatuations are common. Don't spoil your lives by calling it as love. You are a topper. You can get more better girls than Nandu. I don't have anyone except Nandu. I studied well only for her. If I lose her then for whom should I become great? Does Nandu trust you as much as you do? Yes, sir. Will she sacrifice everything and come for you? -Definitely, sir. Do you guarantee that you both won't part amid atrocities? I do, sir. Do you believe that you could take good care of her? -Yes, sir. So, you want her at any cost? Yes, sir. Then I can help you to some extent. I will tell you the plan and you work it out. Later, figure it out yourselves. The Police have come. Hey! Stop eating here. They are from Women welfare association. Why have you come here? We received a complaint that bride is minor. Stop the marriage. Who said that she is a minor? She just turned 18 recently. We have come after verifying her certificates in the college. She is our girl. We will do as we wish. For my marriage, I was 17 and she was 12. Aren't we happy now? Sir, you're a reputed man. Understand the issue here. You think we would stop the marriage if you bring an association? Hey, send them away. Are these the hands of a man who does rowdyism? My hands are rough than yours. My name is Tees Maar Khan. Do you understand me? I will cut off the hands of those who try to stop us. Uncle, sister is running away from that side. Leave me, they are running away. Hey! What are you staring at? Go, catch them. Why did you kill the engine? -It got turned off by itself. Hurry up! They are running away in auto. They are approaching. Start it quickly. Start this tottering vehicle. Move now! -Make it quick! Go, now! -It started, drive now. If they catch us, they will kill us. Drive faster. Brother, they are escaping. Take the car. They can't go much far in auto. Get in quickly. We must catch them before they cross the village. Start the vehicle. Sir, they deflated the tyres. Deflated? Shit! I must blame these fellows first. You check age for marriage alone? Not for love? Hey Tees Maar Khan, will you bring back my girl or should I complain to the Minister that you let them escape? Bring the vehicle. Sir, even our vehicle tyres are deflated. Hello, Control room? It seems like they are sending us off to get married. Why anyone isn't following us? Because I have deflated their vehicle tyres. You're great, man. Is this the short cut way to Hyderabad? He must know. Where are we going? Stop worrying. It's my responsibility to get you to Hyderabad safely. To Hyderabad, in auto? Not in auto. We will park it here and walk by forest. Won't forest animals hunt us? They don't hunt lovers. It's forest all around. How do we get out of here? I know the way. Get down. Where did you bring us? The Police must be on the way. They may be Police, but I'm more smart than them. I know how to mislead them. I've kept Rs.20,000 in the bag. These would do for your expenses. Take off your ornaments and give me. Make it fast. What are you going to do with them? Wait! What are you up to? Answer us. He seems to make us get caught. Hey! -Why are you placing them there? You know what you're doing? We must run that way. When Police arrive, they think we went this way. What a brain! Thank you! Alright! Let's go. Take the bag. I'll bring it. -Let's go. Nandu, careful! There are thorns. Chandu, something stuck to my saree. I will remove it. Careful! Hurry up! -Come fast. Sir, there is the auto. Come fast. We can catch them. Where can they escape to? It's empty. What's that? Sir, they stopped the auto her and ran that way. Sir, the flowered hair is here. Those must have fallen while running. They had ignored these and ran. You go that way, I'll take this way. Who could have taken this way? Stop searching. Wait for a minute. Sir, come fast. They might escape. Stop using brain. It's harmful for the society. Got it? Wait and follow me. He should be named after Useless Khan rather Tees Maar Khan. He's posing like searching something. They are not dumb but you are. To mislead us, they placed those there and ran off this way. It's all forest everywhere. Chandu, I'm scared. You should have that fear while falling in love. Walk now! Bloody age-barred guy! Come on, sir. Hey, why are you speeding up? Because of late action, you delay catching terrorists. Searching needs quick action. Hey idiot, this is Adilabad forest. This is Kawal Wildlife Sanctuary. Wild animals live here. Just recently, it was declared as Tiger zone. What is Tiger zone? This is Tigers spot. Recently, they released 45 tigers here. Oh God! I'm scared of tigers, sir. Bloody youth! They don't care anything except loving. They risked their lives for love. Why should we die? Sir, we must stay together and search. -First, move aside. Come slowly. Chandu, this place is beautiful. Where did we come to? This is called as Saptha Gundala Waterfall. Really? -Yes. This is really spectacular. Yet I didn't read about this anywhere. Come forward. See, how beautiful it is. What's the way to reach this place again? There are no ways. Someone like you should lose their way to come here. It appears as if we have come for vacation rather to escape. Wow! Wow! What a mind bowing! It's mind blowing, not bowing. Whatever! If we don't move, the Police may find us. Change the dress quickly and come. Go, hurry up! You stay here. -Alright, go! You think the Police will find us? My foot! They must have taken the other way. Don't worry. Chandu! Talk something. I'm scared. Hey, Police will find us with her loud voice. Stop her! Chandu! I'm hungry. Even, I'm too. Wait! Take it. Eat. Where did you bring them from? Eat! You know only of escaping. Person like me thinks beyond that. We must eat these and run fast. Give me another one. -Okay. Sir, there they are. Dude, the Police have come. That bald head man came here too? Catch them! -Okay, sir. How far the main road? Not even half a kilometer. There are trees all over. -Careful! There's no proper way to even run. You think government will lay roads for you? My dress! What happened? What happened to dress? Something stuck to it and tore. Dress? It's fine come. -Let's go. Police are coming. No, I've to change it. Come! Not the time to care it. I've to change the dress first. Take this and go. It's getting late. Call her. Nandu, make it fast. Wait for sometime. Still how much time? Almost done. Coming. These ladies always make late. Come fast. The Police are coming. I just can wear a short and come. It doesn't matter if you don't wear anything. -Stop it. Tell her to hurry up. It seems like you both would settle here. May be. I like this place. Enough joking. Come quickly. Chandu, shall we settle down here? Don't irritate me. Come! Chandu, you too come here. Come where? At least, you guys convince her. I will sit here. See, how beautiful it is. A swing! Swing? You call it a swing? Dude, she has left the bag. Wait, I'll get it. What sort of girlfriend you've found to love! Bloody hell! Does falling in love makes us do all these works? I won't love anyone in life. I don't need any girl or her love. Earlier, I used to get feelings for every girl I see. But, by experiencing all these I lost all of them. Catch it! -Slowly! Got you! Sir, come here. Sir, I caught the girl. Do something. -Do something, man. Tiger! Tiger! Tiger! Hey, fatty! Tiger is chasing. Tiger! Tiger! Tiger, sir! -Tiger! Tiger! Hey bald head, run faster! Run faster! Sir, tiger is chasing us. Sir, I saw a tiger. Where? Just now, I saw it there, sir. I myself, am a tiger. Catch the tiger. -Okay, sir. Going, sir. -There are three tigers. Why didn't you go? Sir, I fear tigers. I will come with you. Alright, come. You help the lovers? Run faster! Chandu, Jaffar is not coming. Jaffar! He will come. -Don't think of him. He'll come. You got hurt? -It's alright, you run. There is a highway route near. Go and catch a bus. Go! Chandu, bag? -Bag? Chandu, police! -Got him. Stop! Let's go! -Your S.I. got a cardiac arrest. Constables, come here quickly! Our sir fell ill. Let's go. You screamed to let them hear, right? Want to hop in? Did you elope? Come, I will drop you on the road. You seem like good lovers. But, you are so young. How do you plan to survive? Dear, there's no need to fear. Even I had a love-marriage. I eloped like you and faced a lot of problems. I had overcome those bravely. Now, I'm so happy with my two children. Dear, a risk taker will never fail. I have a friend named Suleman in Hyderabad. He will pick you up when you get down there. Okay. You better get some sleep. It takes time to cross the forest. Hello, dear! Wake up. Road to Hyderabad has come. No, don't! It's alright, keep it. I feel like giving more. But, I don't have much. I did phone Suleman. He will take care of your expenses. I will stop Hyderabad bus, you board it. Sir, we reached Hyderabad. Get down. They didn't carry a bag even. The lorry driver said that a person, Suleman will pick us up? How can we recognise him? Hi! You are looking for me, right? I'm Suleman. I'm the guy you're searching for. The lorry driver is my friend. He told me to take care of you. Come with me. I've helped many lovers. Lovers from every place will come to me. I'm there. Don't worry. As soon my friend phoned me, I searched a home for you to stay. I've bought the essential items from China bazaar. I've searched a job for you. The house is very near. We will make your marriage. I will settle your life. Come! Come with me. Any problem? I alone have been talking. Any problem? We are not adults. We don't need a room. Please, search hostels for us. Very mature thought at such young age. You both are very great. Let's drop the room idea. I like you both. I will provide those to others. Come! Brother! From where all these people have come from? Why there's much traffic here? All love couples like you came and settled here. Shall we click a photo in front of Charminar? My friend's juice shop is over there. I wonder what you have eaten. Come let's eat. Fruit salad is famous here. It's called as Tin fruit salad. It will be tasty. Give me three fruit salad. Sit here! Tasty, right? We don't know when we will visit Charminar again. Let's do one thing. Shall we see Charminar inside? It will be beautiful inside. Do one thing. We both will come after eating. You go and buy tickets for us. Okay. Where did they go? -They have gone. Get lost! Forget kids, even youngsters are missing. This is Hyderabad. Anyone can get sold off. Hey, sit down! Where are you going? -Sit down! Sit down! -Leave me! Brother! Where are we? Who are they? I'm scared. Let's go. You have come to the right place, dear. You look like Miss India. You are settled now. One minute. Yes, dear! A new bird has just arrived. She is still fresh. There's no compromise in the rate. I don't sell her for less than five lakh rupees. Bye! Come dear! -Brother! Leave me! You don't cooperate like this. Brother! Hey, give me the belt. Brother! Tell her to stop beating me. Who can stop me? Take her inside. Brother! The girl is gorgeous. These aren't enough. I need Rs.50,000. It's urgent. You are still due to me. I don't have money now. I will give later. My sister is in hospital. Her condition is serious. She needs a surgery, Is it a surgery or abortion? Mind your words! You expect me to respect persons like you? This has been your business. I heard that you have started your own business? Is that with your sister? You're crossing your limits. Give me my money. I will go. I don't have any. Hello! Yes, dear. This new girl is too hot. I'll share her pictures via whatsapp. Pay me only after seeing her. I don't sell her for less than five lakh rupees. Hey, get lost! Hey, I don't sell the girl. Where will you go? Take care of him. "Dear love, though my dreams are tiring, I kept my eyes open in search of you." "Without you I am alone." "I believed that we both are one."

How dare you cheat me after trusting you all these years? Move! You are dead now. Wait there! Get lost, you broker! Even Police are my regular customers. - I will rip you off! I will see your end here. -Don't come against me. I will destroy you today. - I will not leave you. I found the gun too. You all are dead now. I will kill if anyone stops me. Come out, you rascal! Come out if you've any guts. Move aside. Leave me! Get up. I will not. I'm telling you, get up. I will not. Please, get up. No! Sir, the boy and girl have escaped. Chandu! I'm starving. There's the hotel. Come! What do you want? -Two dosas. Money? -I don't have change for Rs.500. These are banned. See there. I have ten rupees. You won't get anything for Rs.10. I'm starving, Chandu. Meals at Rs.5. Pour some dal. -Curry, please. Come. Two plates, please. You were with them all yesterday. They didn't have it with you, right? Even that ten rupees are spent. We don't have any money now. What shall we do? We can survive without food for a day. But, we need a place to stay. I don't know anything. -What's that answer? Don't you watch films? Where hero works in a hotel or as a bike mechanic to feed heroine. You should do something. I really don't know anything. I didn't even learn how to drive an auto. What to do now? You stay here. Hello! Why are you distributing these? There are courses in it. Learn what you like. Why are you distributing these? -For money. How much? -Two hundred rupees. Who will pay us? -There's address in it. Check it rather asking me. What happened? Who is he? Come, I found a work to do. Work? -Yes. What do you want? -Pamphlets. Those are ours. Which course you want to learn? No, we want to distribute these. Okay, be seated. I'll bring the sir. What do you want? -Sir, they are willing to distribute pamphlets. Give them a thousand pamphlets. Okay, sir. -Alright. Take these. Let's go and collect the money. We have distributed all pamphlets. Our money? Let's go. How much it is? -A total of Rs.2000. Two thousand rupees? -Yes. Ten institutes and Rs.200 each. What shall we do now? -Let's find a hostel. Let's pay for the day. Will see for next days later. I don't have any clothes. First, let's find a hostel and then we will go for shopping. Have it first. You too have some. -No, I'm okay. "I heard that love is a curse." "Only the insane could have said it." "I heard that to love is a sin." "They must have uttered it in unawareness." "After they ask for our couple..." "After they witness our love..."

"They must have uttered it in unawareness." "Anyone in tender age, and in desperation can fall in love." "But loving alone isn't enough, we must abide by it forever."

"After they witness our love..." "They would believe that a life without falling in love isn't worth living." "I heard that love is a curse." "Only the insane could have said it." Get them. Brother, got them. -Bring them. Who are they? What are you doing in public park? Do you marry her now? What are you doing in park? Who are you? What do you want? We save our culture from spoilers like you. We are spoiling our culture? Not spoiling, you are totally destroying it. Valentines day is not part of our culture. You shouldn't roam like this before marriage. People like are you destroying our culture. We just came to have a casual talk. That's it. We haven't yet got the age to marry. You are saying silly reasons like others. See there. They too have silly reasons like you. Who will marry her? She has gone out with many guys. You didn't roam with other girls? You said me to live as I wish before marriage? You told me that you wouldn't ask me about my past? You even bought me an iphone. You are turning me down for marriage? If you're true lovers then marry now. Otherwise, we will have to force it on you. Truly, you will do our marriage? Just permit us. "I've been waiting for us from many lives." "We have got this fortune after all these years." "I will not leave you forever." "This life isn't enough for the persons who became a lovely couple." "Let's go and sail through the challenges." "A century must turn into a second despite many dreams." "I've been waiting for us from many lives." "We have got this fortune after all these years." On the occasion of Valentines day, Hindu activists have made marriages to couples at few places. In this regard, all couples have denied marriage. But, a young couple from Ameerpet have nodded to get married. Got you, finally. Chandu! Come to home, I'll see your end. Leave me, I'll not come. Nandu! Uncle, don't beat me. What is so special about him? How dare you go with him! Leave me, uncle! I will kill you both. Chandu! What is your caste? What is your race? Come on. Bring her. Nandu! I'll see where you will go now. Come! How dare you elope with my girl? -Record it. What are you to do dare it? Nandu! -Bloody immature! Walk! Hey, throw him inside. Despite many disapprovals, Hindu activists kept on making marriages on roads. They are ruining the lives of teenagers. Those activists who conducted the marriage are nowhere seen now. But the parents who saw the news, have destroyed the marriage. Even the public are expressing their resentment towards activists. What do you opine on this? Such associations who make marriages on the name of culture should be banned. Where are the activists who caused turmoil now? What is your opinion? These activists must be tied and bashed. What about you? Because of these associations, siblings of opposite sex are not able to come out. Where are you? They are minors, brother. I didn't know that. Brother, they are filing a case against us for making marriage. We can see this in court. I want them at any cost. -Okay. We will not let them cross the city. I know who can solve this problem. As you're judge's son, it would be helpful if you argue. This is the car. Stop them! Hey, who are you? You think I would get afraid? What do you think of me? Do you know who am I? Do you know who am I? Your honor, our victim, Chandrakanth has forcibly kidnapped my client's daughter, took her gold ornaments and married her. Few activists have conducted that marriage in the name of culture, shamelessly. Why did he point us? So, I request you to do justice to my client by rejecting the marriage and punishing the accused and his supporters. Thank you, Your honor. My lord! As a responsible lawyer, I have obedience and respect towards the court. I have social awareness too. I have the responsibility towards the values of our system. I feel incorrect and obliged to argue this case. Incorrect because it's a minor case. Obliged because they won't be alive if I leave them like this. For the first time, the court is witnessing the law competing against love. As there is a solution for every problem, I believe a solution for this too exists. I request the court to grant me permission to argue this case. Permission granted. Thank you, Your honor! Rapes and honor killings continue to exist in our country because it's believed that our courts cannot do anything. We everyday see in news that our judicial system is held responsible for all the rapes and honor killings in India. If you feel the same in my client's case, then we will be held responsible for another honor killing. My client didn't kidnap Nandu. She came out on her own will. You can ask her. What is there to ask, Your honor? Arguing this case would give opportunity to argue all other waste cases. To avoid that scenario, you must punish the guilty directly. Because of such arguments, everyone stood back without responding. Many big shots are wiping off the crime of raping children and minors, by offering huge money to the victims. We can punish the criminals. But, can we do justice to their iirreparable loss? We got the opportunity to do justice to them before they ruin. Sir, I request you to take forestep. Understand it, sir. So, you want us to support minor marriages? No, I'm not urging to support minor marriages, sir. I'm asking to see their status in the society. My clients have the capacity to reach heights without any support. They are earning more than us in digital marketing. Please, sir. Try to understand. Earning alone isn't enough. Social consciousness is indeed needed to survive. People who married at age of 30 are worried to endure the relationship. And you think of supporting minor marriage? You married at the age of 30 and knew social consciousness well, yet you divorced your wife within two years of your marriage. Order! Order! He's tapping my personal issues that are irrelevant. Your honor! I'm not talking about his personal issues. I'm stressing about the situations. Two persons need mutual affection to live together. My clients are affectionate to each other. I can guarantee it. Court needs laws. But not your guarantees. Your honor, I request you to see this case from human insight. What do you mean? You expect to conduct marriages to all minors? Your honor, I'm talking about eligible persons, not everyone. They have every eligibility to live. I know many persons who had love marriage at minor age, and reached pinnacles in life. My parents are an example for this. Sir, your son is showing you as an example. Order! Order! Your honor, with a favourable convict, we could save two lives. I'm not asking you to approve their marriage that is against the law. Pass the verdict that approves their marriage after reaching the lawful age. Please don't reject this marriage till then. Do we get punished? -If so then we will go to jail. After hearing the arguments from both sides, I feel sad and bit hard to pass the verdict in this case. Here, two minors got married. Lawfully, a man must be 21 and woman must be 18 to get married. But, this case is strange. Even the father who has filed case against forced minor marriage, had attempted to do a minor marriage in the past. After examining these incidents, we cannot trust his words. Neither can we blame these teens. Their marriage has been conducted though they were not willing. But this marriage cannot be approved under any law. Court decides that the girl should wait until she turns 18 and upon her consent this marriage would be approved. Till then the kids must stay with the parents. If they don't wish to stay with them our court will provide a facility for them to stay. Till then the courts warns parents and others not to put any pressure on the kids. Dear, you like to stay with your parents? Sir, why would my daughter want to stay with me? No parent who doesn't understand children has the right to ask it. We can give them birth but cannot snatch their freedom. I've been thinking of my caste and prestige in village. I didn't realise that they have grown enough to make their own decisions. If my daughter likes him, then I would marry her off to him. If you permit us, I would take them to my village and conduct their marriage grandly. I will keep them with me till they get the right age to marry. If you daughter agrees, then the court has no objection. Dear, I didn't know the value of your presence till I lost you. I wish to see the only left daughter's marriage. Will you fulfill my wish? Hey, Chandra Rao, I saw in TV that your daughter has eloped. Chandra Rao, I heard that your daughter eloped. Did you daughter elope? You scoundrel! You need my daughter? You defamed me in village. You... Get aside! Who are you? Why should I give you my daughter? Thrash him more! Don't beat him. Beat him. Don't leave him. Don't beat him, dad. I'm the court and verdict is mine. I won't abide to other court's verdict. You defamed me. She disgraced me. My punishment for you both is death sentence. Turn the vehicle! Get them down! You're dead today. Kill them and send their traces. -Okay, sir. I want the video of their death. I will kill them today and share the video via whatsapp. Please, leave us. Leave us. Don't kill us. Don't do anything to us, please. Chandu! Wait! I told you to wait. I'll deal it. Wait! Let's kill them like their brother. Listen, rather going through our torture, you would die easily if you do as we say. We will kill you without any pain. No! If not then we will kill you with axe. No! -No! If that happens, the remaining one will die out of shock. No! -Please, don't Tell me. Will you opt to die as we guide? Otherwise, you will die seeing others death? We will die as you say. -We will. We will die as you say. Stand up. Come forward. -Come! Insert your head. -Wear it. Record all of this. I've already started recording it. Make it quick. -Proceed. Are we alive? You're safe. -Get up. You grew in our hands. How can we kill you? Though we are rowdies, we are still humans. Even we have hearts. But, you've killed my brother, right? No, dear. We played the same trick and saved them too. Your brother is alive. There, your brother is. Listen to me. From now on, make sure that you don't get noticed in village or TV news or in newpapers or anywhere. Otherwise, your father would kill us. Go somewhere and live happily. Bye!
