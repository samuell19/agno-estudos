- Grandma! Grandpa! You have to see this! I found a map. A map... the key to finally finding my missing parents. This has got to be them. Mom? Dad? Where are you? Arnold! - Mom! Dad! - I can't believe how much you've grown! - And you're still wearing the hat we gave you. - Wait. I've been looking for you, trying to find you. - I know. What have we missed? - Show us the neighborhood. - What? This is really weird. Mom? Dad? Yes, Arnold? - You've been lost for so long. I mean, I always believed you were alive somehow, but... - Stella! Miles! I need you for one last mission! - Wait! Where are you going? - We're off on another mission with Eduardo! - No! Not again! Bye, Arnold! I wonder if I'll ever find them. I know, Grandpa. Don't go in there for a while. You know me so well, short man. - Did you wash your hands? - I knew I forgot something. - Grandpa, I had that dream again. - Oh? What happened this time? - My parents were here... well, sort of... and it seemed like they were gonna stay. - But then they left on another mission. Oh, I'm sorry, Arnold. I miss them, too. But I'm glad you get to see them, even if it's only in a dream. Oh, it's better than the nightmare I keep having. I live in a run-down old boarding house, renting my rooms to a bunch of weirdos who always want things from me. - Hey, Gramps, what's for breakfast? I'm starving here! Starving, do you hear me? - Imagine that. It's a living nightmare. - Make me a sandwich, old man. - Crispy fries and a tofu burger for me, please, and step on it! - Hey, Arnold! Finally, someone with some sense around here. - Hi, Ernie. - Hey, Arnold. - Hi, Oskar. - Hey, Arnold. Good to see you. - Hi, Mr. Hyunh. - All power to the working stiffs! All power to the proletariat! We demand a living wage! - Morning, Grandma. - Hello, dear. - You're not fooling anyone, Pookie. Back in the kitchen. Abner, I don't have any food. Oh, except this apple here. - I know what you want. Bye, everyone. Come on, Abner. - A pig eating bacon? It's very creepy. - See you, Arnold! - Arnold, be well! - Hey, Arnold, ready for the best day of school? - The best day, Gerald? - Yeah, today's the last day of school. Therefore, by my calculations... - It's the best day. - Hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! Where do you two think you're going? - School, dad, remember? Kids? School? The place we go to get away from doofs like you? - Fine, go learn. Come right back and help me sort beepers. - Didn't you get the memo, Bob? Nobody wants beepers anymore. Ever heard of cell phones? - It is true, Helga. A communication device used to alert someone to make a phone call... a relic of an obsolete technology. - I hate beepers. And the only thing that I can kind of tolerate is... - Oof! - Oh! Arnold! I mean, I said, everybody out of my way, Hair Boy! Jeez! What are you, blind? Don't you even know how to not crash into people? - Got one more, Helga? - Ha! Yeah. Maybe you should get walking lessons for your birthday, Arnold. Whatever you say, Helga. - Ooh, good comeback, Arnoldo. Doi! Come on, Phoebes. - Following. - All right, class, settle. I know you're all excited about the last day of school, but get ready for even more exciting news. - Is it that I can do... This? - No, it's not, Harold. Anyway, the news is, we've been selected to compete in a very special contest! A great humanitarian organization in Central America that helps the less fortunate is sponsoring it. They build habitats that provide living space in the rainforest, and they want to celebrate kids that exemplify their spirit. - Mr. Simmons? What do we have to do to win the contest? - Excellent question, Phoebe. We submit a video presentation of our class being humanitarians in our own neighborhood. - What's the prize? - Curly? A class trip to San Lorenzo! - San Lorenzo? The San Lorenzo? - Is that the new Mexican restaurant? - No, that place has been there a while. - Close, Stinky. It's a beautiful, proud republic to our south. This is where we'll go if we win the contest. - To a Mexican restaurant! - No, to San Lorenzo, the country, and the organization that will host us is called "Helpers For Humanity." - That was the group my parents worked for. - And isn't it the same San Lorenzo where your parents disappeared? It's almost like this contest is designed for you. - Quiet down, jerk-faces. I'm trying to concentrate on the clock. - Class, I know you're excited to get to work on this video presentation, even though it's the last day of school. School's out for summer! - I have a summer of stuff to eat! - So long, suckers! - I'll do it. - I will, too. - Great! We're on our way to winning. It's due in a week. - Okay, we'll make the best video ever. - We'll win this thing, go to San Lorenzo, and find your lost parents. - Yeah, but the prize isn't a free trip for me to go looking for them. - True, but how can you not try to find your lost parents, especially since you've got your best friend to help? - Okay. Let's win this contest. - And get you some answers. It'll be our secret. Now we just got to do something humanitarian. - Monkeyman. - I know. Let's build a habitat for Monkeyman, right here on the river. - You're a bold kid, Arnold. - Hey! - Where once was a dirty urban riverbank, we've provided a comfortable floating dwelling for one, as well as a habitat for the local bird life. - Monkeyman! - Great, Arnold. Now I just shoot some more angles of our awesome completed habitat. - I was hoarding that! - My tire collection! - I'm taking it all back! - Thief! Thief! - They took my stuff! - That bird's my lunch! - No! - Oh... - Monkeyman... - Hey, Arnold, where are you going? - That was my last chance to find my parents. - Monkeyman! Monkeyman! - Give me the leg. I like the dark meat. - Hey, sheesh, Arnoldo. Watch it. Stop crashing into me. So, taking a walk and thinking about how you've completely flopped so far in winning the San Lorenzo contest? HA. THIS JUST IN: you equals failure. - Actually, I was just kind of thinking about my life, and how I haven't seen my parents since I was a baby. I wish I could see them again. - Well, I... that's news. I mean, if you wanted to talk about... F... F... feelings... - Sorry, Helga, I think Abner's got to do a number two. See you. Come on, Abner. - Thwarted by a dirty, imbecilic pig. All I wanted to do is tell that stupid Arnold... That I'm here for him. I'm listening. I'm remembering everything he says. Every deep thought, every soul-searching utterance, yes, even every hem and haw! Arnold, I've tried to tell you, but you've yet to show me that you've noticed, that you have feelings too, so I resort to what I do best: being scorchingly mean! Ow! Okay! I'll be kind... And understanding, and... - Aha! If I help Arnold win that trip to that crazy San Lorenzo and help him uncover the mystery of his long-lost parents, maybe even find the lost losers, then Arnold will be eternally grateful and might even return my love! It's win-win! What a great plan! Whee! - Phoebe, I need a hero video, stat. - Right. Arnold tapes 155E, 17C, 101F. Pulling. - How does this thing... oh! - Hey, I think he's starting to trust us. - Oh, that's right. Arnold even saved that dumb turtle. - Don't worry, buddy. We're busting you out of this joint. - He's helped half the city. I'll show those fancy-pants judges why he's got to win! We're gonna need more, but now I need someone to actually make something out of all these. - Mm-mm-mm! This is an epic story you're asking for, Helga. Where'd you get this footage? - Security cameras, okay? - Uh-huh, all labeled and organized in perfect sequence. Whoa! That's Arnold's bedroom. - How'd you... - Never mind. - Major creep factor aside, you know this footage is what we need to win the contest. I thought you hated Arnold. Why are you suddenly helping him? - Because... otherwise, I'd have to watch that stupid football head mope all summer! We've got to make this video work so Arnold can get to stupid San Lorenzo! It really matters to him, doi. You in? - Okay, I'm in, but only if you get everybody to help. - No problem. They can just talk to old Betsy here. - All right. Let's do this. - Well, that was one long, sad walk. I almost rented your room out. - Hi, Grandpa. - Someone came to see you. They're up on the roof. - The roof? - I don't know. I just work here, short man. - Shh, shh. Surprise! Arnold! Arnold! Arnold! Arnold! Arnold! - This is incredible. Everyone's here. - You better have a seat, Arnold. - Why? What's going on? - Lights! - The legend of Arnold will be passed down from kid generation to kid generation and onward, and Gerald is the keeper of all legends, the teller of all tales. Take it away, Gerald. We call him Arnold. Friend to all, force for decency, doer of good. He's the most dependable, trusty, true-blue friend I can imagine. Help you in a second, no questions asked. And I know plenty of others feel the same. Let's hear from some people who Arnold has helped. - I would've never left my stoop, and now look at me, sitting on the biggest stoop in the city, and it's all because of Arnold. Now I can harass people from my stoop and from off my stoop! Anyway, guy's got a great heart. - He helped me get over myself. Now I'm tolerant, gracious, and self-effacing. Oh, and humble. I'll get a copy of this, right? - Arnold put me back together with my old partner, Don, and remade my career. I get applause from fans, but Arnold's the real star, baby! - Arnold helped me escape the cage of my old rooftop habitat. Now, I'm as free as a bird! Merci, Arnold. - Arnold listened to me and treated me just like another friend. He's, you know, pure of heart. I'll never forget that, Arnold. - I can inaudibly say that the over-esteemed Arnold put the "coach" back into Coach Wittenberg. - I was a one-dimensional bully until Arnold showed me my sensitive side. - Arnold? Never heard of him. - Arnold almost killed me... But then saved my life, got me a new fish, kept me from going bad! Thanks, Arnold. What a pal! Aah! I'm okay! - Pure of heart. That's Arnold. And that's why he deserves to win the trip to San Lorenzo... because he's done so much for others. He's a humanitarian, just like his parents and the Helpers for Humanity. - Monkeyman! - Hey, Arnold. You're a bold kid, and a true hero. - Thank you all so much, but aren't we too late to enter the contest? - I have wonderful news, Arnold. Once the Helpers for Humanity saw this video, we were immediately selected to go to San Lorenzo. That's right! We won! - Mm... - Never fear. I have every minute planned out for this trip. Getting anyone lost is definitely not on this agenda. - Mm-hmm. You ever travel with a dozen kids before? - I know this video wouldn't have happened without you, Gerald. I can't thank you enough. - You should thank Helga. This video was her idea. You should see all the videos she has... - Of the things... around the city! Amazing. Anyway, it's done. We're going to San Lorenzo. - Wow, thank you, Helga. And I... have to go wash my socks. A football-headed kid - wins the contest... - Whee! - And gets to go with his whole class to the Central American country of San Lorenzo. - Believe it or not... - Well, short man, your passport's here. - All right! - Ah, ah, ah. Not yet. Now, Arnold, I'm still worried about you taking this trip. Remember all the trouble your parents got into with that evil river pirate Lasombra? That was practically the last time we heard from them. Oh, fine. Don't forget to sign it with your name as it appears on your birth certificate. - Arnold Shortman. Grandpa, San Lorenzo is a big country. I'm not going to look for this Lasombra guy and I doubt if I'm gonna run into him. - Let's hope not! This is just a school trip to visit the rainforest, not about you finding your parents. - Don't worry, Grandpa. I'll stick with my class the whole time, but since I'll be in San Lorenzo, I have to at least look up Eduardo. He was my mom and dad's best friend. - Well, you could at least do that. - Venture forth armed with this, Kimba. - Pookie! Arnold will never get a handmade blowpipe through security. Oh, and... Here, short man. Take this instead. It'll remind you of home. - Um... thanks? Just be careful, Arnold. - That sure is a lot of luggage, Miss Rhonda. - One bag for every day of the trip. That's how I pack. - Harold, why do you have a deli platter? - My mom gave me this in case there's no food in San Lorenzo. - There's plenty of food there, Harold. No platter necessary. - No platter? - Oh, Arnold, though on the outside I appear to hate the idea of going to some godforsaken jungle with you, 'tis merely a guise! I'll help you find your long-lost parents and just maybe... Surprise, baby sister! I'm coming along on your San Lorenzo trip as the student teacher-slash- chaperone. Goody! - Are you kidding me? This is the worst news ever! - I'm worried about your safety in this St. Lawrence place, Olga. - I'll be fine. Thanks, Bob. - Oh, good, you're here. Take this bag of beepers with you and sell them to the locals. - Arnold. You're going to the jungle, so don't catch any tropical diseases like malaria, or diphtheria, or cholera, or yellow fever, or hookworm, or elephantiasis, or leprosy, or tennis elbow! - Ah! - Or itchy armpits! Or boom boom fever or Aulder's neck rash! - Hey! Crazy lady! Get out of my stair truck! - Or Palmer's knee, or Borneo's disease! Or... I don't know, athlete's foot! - You know, I'm really gonna miss Grandma and Grandpa. Abner! What are you doing here? - Guess your grandpa wasn't gonna let you leave your pig behind, Arnold. Yep. I guess we've got a stowaway. - My hair! - You know what they say, Rhonda. It's not the heat. It's the humidity. - Class, let's stay together while we explore and then go to the river docks at 3:00 p.m., then it's on the boat, and... Stop! Running is not on the agenda! River docks at 3:00! - Come on, baby sister! - Ugh. - Miss me? - Ugh! - Well, Arnold, we made it to San Lorenzo. So, where do we start looking for your parents? - Sorry, Gerald, I promised Grandpa I wouldn't, but he did say I could find their best friend, Eduardo. I found this old envelope with Eduardo's address on it. Here it is. - Whoa. - What happened? It looks like Eduardo kind of left in a hurry. - Abner, what is it, boy? - I don't know what's bugging Abner, but we better get back and meet Simmons, Arnold. We can't miss the boat. - Hello! Welcome! You must be Mr. Simmons and your PS 118 class. My name is Eduardo. Hi, Eduardo. Eduardo? Arnold. Could it be? Arnold, it's me, your parents' best friend. Qué buena fortuna. I am the captain of this boat, and I will take you up the river to the rainforest. We'll go straight to the habitat that my group, Helpers for Humanity, made. - Yes, like my parents. - Of course. We all worked together. - Hi, I'm Gerald. What a relief. We thought something bad... - Captain Eddie? Is there a toilet on this boat? - Of course, of course, disculpe. Where are my manners? Everyone, all aboard! - We're on the boat, we're on schedule... The captain even knows Arnold. This'll be a perfect trip. - I couldn't agree more, Mr. Simmons. - I want to introduce my crew. - This is Paolo. - Hey. - Steve. - Hola. - And Che. - Oh! - Everybody loves Olga. - I still can't believe I'm in San Lorenzo with you, Eduardo. - Is it fate? Who knows? EDUARDO, I HAVE TO KNOW: where are my parents? Are they alive? - Ah, qué lástima. That's a mystery I have not yet solved either, amigo. But I bet you'd like to hear my stories of your parents. - Yes, please! - Ha! Let's see. Eh, your father... was always bumping into things and breaking them. I think the first three times he met your mother, he broke something. His arm, his head... They were both my best friends. Your father would want you to have this. It was a gift to him from the Green-Eyed People. You know, they helped each other many times. - Huh? - Ay, qué... I've never seen this happen before. You truly must be chosen, Arnold, chosen by the Green-Eyes. Surely you know that when you were born, that you silenced the erupting volcano, Volcán Turriable? - It was in my dad's journal. - The Green-Eyes saw that, too. It fulfilled a prophecy. Maybe when we are upriver, we... you and me... we will find the Green-Eyed People. Maybe they will know the answer to the mystery of your parents. - Hey, Arnold. It's buffet time. - I, uh... - Go on, play, Arnold, play. Friends should be with friends. - I love buff-ets! - Ooh, pitaya! Well, I guess I'll add pitaya to my allergy list. - I finished all the deli sandwiches, the carne con whiskers... Ooh! Ah! Hmm! Clear the bathroom! Emergency! Kill me now! - Man, Olga makes it look so easy. What's her secret? Besides being pretty and charming and nice. - I'm queen of the world! Time to feed the fish! - Hey, ocupado! - Hey, Eduardo. What are you looking at? - Oh, nothing, Arnold, nothing. But this is the jungle, and you must always be aware of the dangers here. - Like Lasombra? - So, you've heard about the infamous Lasombra? He was not happy that your parents stole back from him a precious treasure called the Corazón. - Is he after me? We're in danger, aren't we? - We could turn around and head back to safety, or we can continue ahead, and maybe find out about your parents. - What? But I promised... No. With you to protect us, we keep going. - Now, don't tell the others what we spoke about. I don't want to worry anyone. - Anything wrong, Arnold? - Uh, nothing. Everything's fine. - Come on, man. There's no secrets with us, right? And now you've got some secret with this guy you just met? Fine. Arnold, what a surprise. I came up here to think about life and stuff. - Yeah, me too. - So... up here, staring into the night, trying to figure out how to tell me something, huh? - Well, actually, I do have something to confess. - Confess? Like a confession? Like a deep-seated secret you've been harboring and haven't told me? - Yeah. You ever feel like there's a hole in your heart? - Yes. All the time. - This whole trip's been about one thing. I want to find my lost parents. I feel like I'm about to put us all in... - Yeah, yeah, I know all about your parents. - How do you feel about me? - Huh? - You wouldn't even be here without me. Oh, Arnold, I may act like I don't care, I may even say I hate you, but that's a cover. I actually do care about you. - Huh? - Don't play dumb, Arnold. You know what I'm talking about. You're like some weird old wise man, for crying out loud. I know you can handle the truth, and I can, too. - What are you talking about? - I'm talking about the fact that I really like you, Arnold, like thunder likes lightning, like faces like fists. You know, like-like. - In fact, I lo... - Uh-oh. There's a boat coming. - Eduardo! - Eduardo! There's... a ship. - Arnold, it's Lasombra. - I knew it! What are we going to do? - We'll fight back and get away. Stay down where they cannot see you! - But what about my friends? - Forget them! - Oh, dear, a pirate attack? Not on the agenda. - Fight hard, Che! But don't hurt your runway-quality chiseled face! - Hold on tight, amigo. Yes, my friend. I'm changing course down the Río De Oscuridad. It has tricky and dangerous rapids. He wouldn't dare to follow. - Ugh! Who booked this? - Bueno. Lasombra may be a ruthless river pirate, but he's not crazy... no, far from it. - Whoop! There we go. Whoop! Down again. Oh, this is so fun! - Aah! - Hold on, Helga! - Can this get any worse? - Hold on tight! - I'm okay. - Everyone! Abandon ship! - Abner! Abner! Here, boy! Where are you? - So... who's starving? - Oh, I have snacks in my other luggage. I'll just go back and get them. Or not. - Now, friends, let me explain what has just happened back there. - A thrilling classic chase scene! And now we're shipwrecked and lost! - Untrue. We have escaped an unexpected attack, and yes, our boat is unfortunately wrecked, but there's good news. We are not lost. We can hike from here to our jungle habitat, a safe place. - Is the habitat a short walk from here? - Oh, no. No, it's many, many, many miles, over rough trails... - Oh, that is such bad news. - Through steep, muddy jungle... - Ugh, just got worse. - But then it smooths out... - And becomes an enormous swamp. - Okay, I demand an explanation, mister. What really happened back there? Who attacked us and why? - We were attacked by river pirates. Their leader is called Lasombra. He is after Arnold. - Who's that? - Why is this Lasombra after Arnold? - That is Arnold's business. Let's get going. Vámonos. - We didn't sign up for this, Arnold, but you knew that already. Now we're literally up the river without a stinking paddle! - No, no fighting, no fighting. We have one big job TO DO NOW, FRIENDS: to walk. We can do this. And take only what you need. - Oof! - Oh, gross! Get it off! Oh, I think it bit me. - Ooh! It's like Christmas. - My Beatle boots! - I see the habitat! - We're safe! Thank you, Eduardo. - Vámonos, amigos. You can rest and dry out and have a hot dinner. - I'm starving! - We're back on schedule. - Yeah, I guess it all worked out. - Um, eh... may I have your attention? There's been a misunderstanding which I would like to correct. I am not Eduardo. I am Lasombra. And you are now my prisoners. - No! - And you will remain my prisoners until this football-headed boy shows me where to find the Corazón. - Thank you, all of you, for walking right into my trap. - How could you? - Easy. See? Eduardo, Lasombra. Eduardo, Lasombra. Abraham Lincoln, Frida Kahlo. Easy. - Yeah, that's hilarious, La Bozo, but I'm Helga G. Pataki, and I'm not staying! So if you'll just open the gate, we'll be on our way. - You are staying. I went to the trouble to arrange that whole phony contest and class trip just to lure Arnold here. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. I have a question. Does this dump get Wi-Fi? Yes. - But I'm not giving you the password. - You monster! - How did you guess? Go change it to the other password! And don't forget to write it down this time! - Okay, Lasombra, you have me now. You can let my friends go. - Arnold, come on, don't be mad. You're my partner, remember? Our secret? - Partner? What secret is he talking about? - No! I mean, he... - Oh, Arnold didn't tell you? We planned to go look for his precious Green-Eyed People. Green-Eyed People? - No, no, he's twisting it all up. I thought maybe if we found the Green-Eyes, they could tell me where my parents are. - Arnold, say it ain't so. You weren't actually helping this jamoke? - I knew it! Why didn't you just tell me? - I'm sorry, Gerald. - You've gone Benedict, Arnold. Benedict Arnold was a general who defected to the other si... We know, Simmons! - Sheesh! So what's so great about this mega-doofus, anyway? - The ancient Green-Eyes foretold that a child of the volcano will save them, and they believe Arnold to be that child. For years, I have sought after the mysterious Green-Eyes to get my hands on their even more mysterious Corazón. Corazón. TRANSLATION: heart. - With him by my side, the Green-Eyes are sure to show themselves to me. As you see, I've made a career of stealing and selling all that is precious in Central America, but one treasure still eludes me: the Corazón. - Psst! Do you need an inside man? I can be the camp snitch. Wink. - Sorry, kid. You are too loco, even for us villains. - Great job, bringing us all here for your bogus contest and instead, you sap, we're all prisoners of some stinking psycho river pirate! - Listen, Helga, I... I didn't want to hurt... - Ah, save the speech. You'll be fine. As for all of you, lock them up. - What? - You heard the boss. Move it. - I can't believe you did this, Che. - Muévelo, muévelo. Rápido, rápido. - This is all your fault! - This is really bad. - Way to go, Arnold. - I'm really disappointed in Arnold. - Next chance I get, I'm knocking that dingus Arnold into next week. - Mom, Dad, all these years, I hoped that we'd find each other and be a family again. But... I guess I'm never going to find you. I'll never know what happened to you. Good-bye, Mom. Good-bye, Dad. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. - Oh, Arnold... you poor tortured creature. Having known the depths of your despair, I wouldn't have left your side in your time of loneliness! If ever you needed my love, it's now, and you have it, forever and always. I must do anything, make any sacrifice, to help you find your parents. Oh, Arnold, you magnificent specimen! I'm coming for you! Uh, Helga? - Brainy? Oh! I could hit you! - Phoebe, Gerald! - What's up, Helga? - Look, Arnold may be a total sap who traded all of our lives for a bag of metaphorical magic beans, but he needs our help. We've got to do something! - Ugh. That kid's gonna be doing my chores for weeks to make up for this, but I'm in. What's the plan? - Phoebe? - Hmm... We can't all escape at the same time. They'll certainly notice our absence and capture us again. - Okay, so, Helga, you and I bust Arnold out so we can find these Green-Eyed People, and Phoebe... - I'll take care of everything here. I miss Arnold! - Yah! Hi-ho, Silver! - Oh, no, Curly has gone completely crazy! Get him off of me! - See you on the other side... handsome. - It tickles. - What's go... - Shh. - What are you guys doing here? - We're your rescue committee. - I thought you guys hated me. - Well, of course, everyone hates you, bucko, but we've got to bust you out of here and find those Green-Eyes if we want to save ourselves. - But what can we do? Lasombra won. - Don't you give up now! Your blind optimism is one of your most annoying qualities. Besides, after the Green-Eyes help us, they might have some information on your parents. - Come on. Hmm? Oh... - Grandpa said this would come in handy. - Hmm? Oh, what... what are you... - Grandpa was right, football head. - This isn't funny anymore! - Nadine, now! - Oh, araña... - Whoo. We did it. We're free. - Thanks for not giving up on me, Gerald. - Ah! And now that you've dragged us to stinking San Nowhere-zo, how do we find these Green-Eyes? - Don't worry, I've got a map, and according to my dad's journal, the Green-Eyes live somewhere around here. Come on! - Cute. He's got a map. - Oof! - What's going on? - Jefe, the weird-headed mocoso escaped. It's not my fault! - So, did a small child knock you out, or did you just fall asleep, pobrecito? Please, Jefe, don't kill me! - Ah, well done. You did exactly as I wanted. - Hmm? I did? - See? I intended for him to escape. The Green-Eyes would not have shown themselves if I was with him, so I put a tracking device on him. Now, he will lead me straight to them. Gather the crew. We're going hunting for Green-Eyes and their precious Corazón. - Oh, no! They've already discovered that Arnold has escaped! Baby sister! - Don't panic, Olga. Do you still have that bag of Big Bob's beepers? - Right here. But these can only receive messages. It's one-way communication. Just like me and Che. - But Rhonda's phone can send a message. - Nada bar-os. - I can tap into Lasombra's Wi-Fi signal... - My phone! - And transmit a low-data package that will bypass the need for a password. Now we need to scavenge some additional parts. 8-0-8 for "Bob," and 5-0-5 for "SOS." Voila. We now have a long-wave homing beacon sending our precise coordinates. - Thanks for the help on the new display, Miriam. Whoa. - Huh? Uh, I'm up, I'm up. - Beepers are freaking out. I don't get it. What does... What does 505-808 mean? - Oh, that's beeper code for "SOS, Bob." "SOS" means "help." - I know what "SOS" means, but who would want my help now, Miriam? - Aren't the girls on a field trip? Olga! - Oh, and the other one. - Oh, right, right, Helga. - All right, all right. Keep your pants on. Abner? How in the Toledo did you get here? - Oh, my! What happened? - What? - No. - No. Are you kidding me? There's no way that happened. Oh, my stars. Well, you are blowing my mind. Well, then what... - Oh, what? They serve shrimp cocktail in first class? - You came all this way to tell us about shrimp cocktail? - No, it's Arnold! He's in trouble. - But Arnold's in San Lorenzo. - Well, what are you waiting for, an invitation? We got to rescue Arnold! Ah? A-ha-ha, yeah! - Oh, Pookie, not the fake hitchhiking leg! - Oh, stick in the mud. - Phil? Gertrude? You guys are still alive? - Imagine that. - What in the Big Bob's Beepers are you doing there? - Trying to get to San Lorenzo. - Hey, us too! - Well, you need a ride? We got a plane. - Wow. Fancy plane. The beeper business must be booming. - Oh, no, that's not us. This is. - So, how do we get past this waterfall? - Okay, my guess is that we're... I don't know. - Hey, football head, your shirt is glowing. - What? Because it's next to the map? Look, it's a key! There's a hidden path behind the waterfall. - Are you sure you're even reading that map right? - I'm positive. - Oh, sure. So there should be some sort of giant eyeball here? You got us lost, football head. - Did I hear someone mention a giant eyeball? - Arnold, fork over the map. Oh, for crying out loud! - Good thinking, Helga. You're brilliant. Well, at least one of us can read. Ah! - Booby trap! - Did I say it was okay to touch me? - Oh, boy. - Oh, my gosh. This shows us which tiles to avoid. Forward, forward, forward, left, forward... Forward, left, forward, right... - Maybe we're supposed to... Oof! Hold it. It says there's some kind of false floor here. Follow my lead. - Whoa, whoa, whoa! - Gerald! - It looks like we have to hug the wall. This way! - Well done, volcano boy. Qué es esto? - Andale, ándale! - What? Please, you first. - No, Jefe, you first. - No, no, no, I insist. You first. - Shouldn't have gone first! - Impressive. Let's go. Fine. Good luck coming back the way we came. - Espérame! Jefe? - Eyes on the prize. - Hmm. The amulet stopped glowing. There's no more information on the map. - Oh, for crying out loud! - Well, if you don't mind, I could use a break. My dogs are barking. - We'll have to find the Green-Eyes on our own from here. - You have got to be kidding me! This is the middle of nowhere, football head! - Whoa! - Gerald! - Are you okay? - Gerald? Whoa! - Mm-mm-mm! Arnold? That statue sure looks a lot like you. - Hmm. I got to say, it's not half-bad. I've seen better. - It's them! It's the Green-Eyes. Arnold... Arnold... - Class, with a little ingenuity, we can transform tragedy into a teachable moment. Okay, class, listening ears! - Well, so much for adult supervision. We have to break out now, and I'll need everyone's help. First, Olga, you distract the guards. - Yoo-hoo! El guard-o! Ow! Oh! - Next, Nadine, you get us the keys. - Oh! Ah! Ah! - Harold and Sid, you get the other guards to come down to ground level. - Air guitar! - Look at me! I'm a distraction! - I'll use my makeshift electromagnet to disarm the guards. - Huh? - Next, unleash the Curly. - Free the animals in the zoo! - Mama! Ah! - Class... - Let's go, buddy! - With the guards safely locked away, we simply walk out the front door. - Phoebe, what do we do now? - Geronimo! - Sacagawea! - Gesundheit! - Wow, Phoebe. You thought of everything. - You kids okay? We got your message. - Oh no. - Oh, daddy! That boy was mean to me! You and me are gonna go round and round! - Yah! Hee-yah! - Eat wrench! Take it! - Agenda coming through! - Aha! - Ah! - Ah! - My poor hair! - Ya-ha-ha! Ow! - Don't go in there for a while. - Watch out for the boss! - I'm like the big ball in that movie! - Ah! - Qué pasa? Oh! Pardon me! Ow! - Arnold! Arnold! Where are you, short man? - Mr. Shortman, Arnold's up there. - Somewhere. - Oh. Arnold. - Come on, guys, we need your help. Our friends are prisoners of Lasombra. Arnold. - Yeah, I got that. - Hey, what's the big idea? - Whoa. The Green-Eyed People's hidden city! Arnold... - Yeah, yeah, "Arnold." We get it! Arnold. Arnold. - Do you notice anything strange about this place? There are no grownups here. - That's the weird part? Finally, a bigwig in charge. - Literally. Arnold. - What? She's a kid, too? - Arnold. - Please, can you help us? - Don't suppose she hablas inglés? - I got this. Hey girl, how's it going? - What the... - Man, why can't I ever be the chosen one? - All right. Close enough, sister. - Hey, Arnold, check it out! - Looks like the king is... sleeping? Lazy much? - This must be about the sleeping sickness that my parents came here to cure. - Arnold... - Looks like she's giving us the grand tour. - It better be grand. We've come a long way for this. - Look, there's a bunch of people sleeping over here, too. - So is this what happened to all the grownups in this joint? They're asleep? - Mom, Dad. Do you know where they are? Please, do you know these people? - Oh, my gosh. These paintings are, like, straight out of my dad's journal. That's the first time they brought the serum to the Green-Eyes. - The serum? - Yeah, the cure for the sleeping sickness. But at some point they didn't have enough? - What's going on here, Arnold? - My parents are making more of the cure? - It's the Corazón. - The treasure Lasombra's so crazy about? - Child of the volcano. Is that supposed to be me? Arnold! - What am I supposed to do? - I know you want me to do something, but I need more to go on. - This... whatever it is looks like the thing from the painting. See? Up there, in the middle. - Hey, yeah. And they've got the Corazón there, too. - But... I don't know what to do. - I know what to do. Buenos días, partner. Lasombra. - So you've heard of me? How flattering. Well, I am infamous. At last. The Corazón. The sacred treasure of the Green-Eyed People is finally mine! - No, it's not yours! We need it! It's got something to do with the sleeping sickness! - Oh. You think so? Well, it's too late. It's mine now. And you, my fabled football-headed friend, led me right to it. - What? - Oh? You did not realize you were wearing a tracking device? - The amulet? - Gah! Of course! - Yes. I used the Green-Eyed People's own treasure against them. I thought that was a very clever evil touch. And after centuries of being hidden, you, Arnold, brought me right to them. - Where are our friends? - Ah, don't worry. My guards are keeping an eye on them. Speaking of which, who is guarding this place? Wait. You are all children? - Uh, doi. Welcome to five minutes ago. - A hidden city full of treasures and no guards, only children, to stop me from taking it all? Why stop at the Corazón? - No! You can't take their things! - You're right. Why take anything when I could bring people here and sell it to them? I could charge admission! I CAN SEE IT NOW: "Hidden City-Land." Ow! How dare you? Ah! You meddling... don't understand capitalism! Yah! - I can see we're not wanted here, Arnold. - Vámonos. - No! - No? I need you, partner. - Oh! - Ah! - Come on. - Arnold! - Stop! - Guys, wait, don't! - Oh criminy. So of course I've got to go out on the stupid rope bridge to save the stupid football head. - Oh man, I can't believe I'm doing this. No! Go back! Ah! - Oh, whoa! Helga, Gerald, hang on! Come here, volcano boy. - Let me go! Ugh. - Let you go? You are the only one who can open it. - No! We need to save my friends. - First, open the Corazón. Then you can play with your little amigos. - Take your time, Arnoldo. We just love hanging out here. - Oh... - It's the heart of gold. - Out of my way! So beautiful. And it's all mine... Ooh! Ah! Ah! - I want to un-see that. - Take my hand! - Pull! - I'm trying! - Try harder! - Whoa! - Come on up, mijos! - Who's that? - Who cares? - Hey. - Aren't you... - Eduardo! It's really you? - Hello, my... - Wait. Not another Eduardo, your parents' trusted friend with a moustache? Ha! I've heard that before. Why should we trust him? - You are welcome to climb back down. - How'd you find us? - I have been following you since your class came to San Lorenzo. I suspected that Lasombra would use you to get to the Green-Eyed People somehow. They broke into my place and kidnapped me. I escaped, but got to the dock too late. I hate to chase you in another boat. - Oh. On the river! We thought we were being attacked by pirates. - No, it was me. I lost you at the rapids but I was able to pick up your trail where you crashed. - I'm so glad you're here. We found the Green-Eyed People's hidden city. It's where my parents disappeared. - So then you have seen them? Miles and Stella are... are alive? - I don't know. - So, you finally caught up to us, Eduardo. You call that a moustache? - Did you think you could get away with this, Lasombra? Miles and Stella protected the Green-Eyed People from you, and now, their son will, too. - Always so presumptuous. They're not safe yet. - Give it to me! It's mine! - You pest! Just like your parents! I'm going to throw you over the cliff. Go get it! HE DIED THE WAY HE LIVED: full of poison. - The Corazón! It was sacred to them. Now it's gone. - Hey, football head. We're alive, okay? Now let's go back to that hidden city and find out what happened to your parents. How are we gonna get back over there? - Um, I prefer the stone bridge, myself. - Well, all right, then. Arnold. - Arnold, your parents are here. She will take us to where they lie. Dad? Mom? It's me. - Arnold... - Are they... - No, no. It's the sleeping sickness, from over nine years ago. - But... they had a cure. - Yeah, and it had something to do with that big stone wheel thingy in the temple. - Ol' What's-her-name's got to know about it. - They believe that you are the one to open the Corazón, and with a heart of gold inside, you would awaken the sleeping parents and reunite them with their children. - The Corazón was the cure? - But... It went over the cliff. - We have to tell her what happened. Lasombra... - But they're alive. There's got to be a way to wake up your parents. - Helga, what are you doing? - This must be it! You were supposed to put the heart of gold here and then, well, something would happen. I'm not a scientist. - I know what this is. These are the controls to a machine Miles told me about. The Green-Eyed People would put herbal formulas in the center altar, and the machine would spread them aromatically. - My dad and mom knew about this. It's in the mural! So, instead of herbs... Look! They put the cure right here so it could cure the whole city at once. - Ah, genius. - But without the heart of gold... the Green-Eyes, my parents... they can't be cured. - I might have something that would work. It's, uh, a heart. I think it could fit. This is just gold-plated. It's not a very pure heart. - I don't know. I think your heart is more pure than you know. You are such a football head. Arnold! - Okay, what's going on? - There's butterflies. Wait. Could that mean... - Mama! Hey, Arnold. Arnold, Arnold... - Looks like you finished the work we started, Arnold. - I'm so proud of you, son. - Mm-mm-mm. Now I've seen everything. - Good one, Gerald. Helga? Hey, Helga. - Ah! Hey, Arnold. - Helga, I've known you my whole life, practically, and you've always been angry and kind of... - You know, mean. - Yeah. So? - But... I've also seen you be really loyal and super brave. So I always wondered if maybe you were mean to me because, well, you loved me. - Love? You? Well, yeah, sure, I mean, like I'd love a root canal. - Listen, I know you tried to tell me before, and I wasn't ready to hear it, but now, this whole thing... the trip to San Lorenzo, getting away from Lasombra, finding my parents... it's all 'cause of you. Your locket... - Locket? What locket? - Your locket... it woke up my parents. You did it all just to help me, and... and... - Mm-mm-mm. - Okay, now I've seen everything. Mom? Dad? - Hey, gramps, what's for breakfast? I'm starving over here! Starving! - Make me a sandwich, old man. - Crispy fries and a tofu burger for me, please, and step on it! - Breakfast is served. Eggs in a basket. - Don't you mean toad-in-a-hole? - We call it eggs-in-a-basket. - Finally, someone with... - No disrespect, but you've both been asleep for ten years. What do you know about breakfast? - Mom! Dad! You're really back! Hey, Arnold! - Were you having that same dream again, where you never found us? - Yeah, the same dream I've been having all summer. - It's no dream, Arnold. You really came and rescued us, and now we're really back home with you. What do you say we go on an adventure today? I read that the city botanical gardens has a new rainforest exhibit. - Sounds great, but... it's actually the first day of school. - Oh, of course! - We knew that. - Sure. We're hip. Come on, Abner. - Creepy. - Who is that cute little blond boy? - Bye, everyone! - Bye! - Good-bye, Arnold! - Well, Arnold, you ready for the worst day of school? - You mean the first day of school? - That's what I said. - Come on, Gerald. Look at the bright side. We're in sixth grade now. How bad could it be? Hey! Who said you could touch me? - Hey, Arnold! - Hey, Arnold! Can we walk with you to school? - Yeah, we already miss you. - Sure, Mom and Dad. - Hey, Arnold! - Welcome back! - Hey, Arnold! I still have a job! - You'll have to stay outside, okay? - Okay. - When will you be done? Uh, 3:30. - We'll be waiting right here. Yeah, yeah, Arnold.
