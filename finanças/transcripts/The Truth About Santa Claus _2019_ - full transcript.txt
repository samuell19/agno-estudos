- Michael, Michael is that you? - Nope, no, no, no. - Michael, seriously? - Hey, how's it going, nice to see you, nice to see you, Merry Christmas, how are you? We're gonna do some painting, some wrapping, nice to see you sir. And, yeah, we're gonna just, what's the matter Gabby? Since when in your entire six years of existence have you not wanted to talk? - Bobby said Santa isn't real. - Bobby, why would you say that? - Well, Mike Morris said that he saw Santa smoking a cigarette in his car by the mall. - Mike, Mike Morris. You guys are listening to Mike Morris? He doesn't know what he's talking about. But I'll tell you what, he probably did see a Santa smoking a cigarette in his car. - See, I told you so. - But, that's 'cause that's not the real Santa. - Not the real Santa? - Yeah, that was one of his backup Santas. - Back up Santas? - Yeah, they're like his helpers. They're not like elves but they're like backup Santas. You guys think the real Santa could just go to the mall? That guy is super famous, people would freak out and then how would he get all that work done? You're just saying that. - I am not, that is the truth. - How do you know? - How do I know, because I know him. - You know Santa? - No, I mean, it wasn't me. It was a guy I know that met a guy that knows him kind of, so I kind of know him. - How did he get to meet the real Santa? - Well, it's actually a funny story, but we don't really have time, we're supposed to be doing this wrapping thing. - Please. Please. - Okay, okay, okay, I'll tell you but you have to promise me one thing, you can't tell anybody. - We promise. - I promise. - Okay, once upon a time there was this guy and he was like, he was a doctor and he was super awesome, everybody in town loved him. He might've been a little bit, what's the word, self-absorbed no, no. He was like busy, he was like a busy beaver. It's like always around like doing something. I don't know, he was just focusing on the wrong stuff. - Hey Michael, let me ask you a question. You were a bathrobe? - Hey Bob, I don't. Sorry, I gotta go. - Well look, the reason I'm asking is I gotta get another one, this one's full of holes and stains, I can't wear this. - I don't know Bob, try Amazon. - Yeah, Amazon, that's a good idea. I guess this is why you make the big bucks and I'm standing around this raggedy bathrobe, freezing my buns off. Speaking of buns, you know my son he's always thinking about-- - Gotta go, thanks - A nice donut, speaking of buns. Not bad either. - You can't park here. You can't park here, this is a private lot. I don't know, he wasn't always the nicest guy. This is for my patients. You can't get parking here, so. Communication is a difficult thing, even when you use words. - I don't even think it's a real problem. What, just because a judge says I get angry a little too much. I mean, please come on. What, now I gotta go see a therapist for the rest of my life. - Look, it's just temporary, right? This is pending an evaluation, so. - He didn't tell me that the nurse was gonna put the needle in. You gotta warn a guy, right? I mean, she didn't do that. - Big guys have feelings too. I was hanging out with Ving Rhames the other day. He's not sensitive about his size at all. I just don't get it. - Are you feeling like you can't express yourself because of your size? - I could be in a situation where someone's struggling to lift something up and I don't even have to know the person and they are looking at me like why aren't you helping me with this refrigerator? - I think one of the reasons why you may be feeling frustrated. - Wrong answer. - So you know, I don't hate you, I hate the judge. - Okay, why don't we just circle back in, I think we've gone off the rails a little bit. I have to be honest, Michael. You know we've been doing this for a while now and I think-- One of the main problems is this behavior. - It just gets me upset. I mean, he doesn't know me. I'm a really nice guy. - I don't know. The judge just think that maybe therapy will help. - Help, if he thought I needed help why did he send me to therapy? - How tall are you, man, stand up. - I prefer not to. - You tell me to express myself, you started this. - You know what, time's up. We'll pick this up, you know, next time. And now you all out of time, now you're in a hurry? See, that's something you little dudes say. I will find out how tall you are, believe me. - But I'm trying to help you, okay. I mean, do you realize I've only heard your real voice maybe twice, maybe once? I mean, don't you think that there may be a problem here? - He doesn't sound that awesome. - Well, he was that awesome. - I don't like him either. - Why don't you like him, you don't even know him. Will you just give him a chance, gosh. I mean, he even had his own secretary. I mean, it might've been his aunt, but it's still cool he had a secretary. - Wait, isn't your aunt your secretary too? - Yes, a lot of doctors have aunts as secretaries. That's like a thing, all right, you know what, no more questions. All right, the story is just getting started. - Okay. - Life was great, he thought he had everything figured out. Everything was good and then the reality was he was missing something, something big. - So I said to her, just don't get involved in every detail and then you won't get aggravated about everything. You know, just ask for. Oh, Michael, Michael, hold on, I need you to sign right here. - Right, what am I signing? - You're giving me a raise, hurray. Family bonus. - All right, yes, great, just take it. Hey and Janine, can we take this down, please? - Michael, it's Christmas. - Yeah, but this is just a lot and it's not Christmas yet. - Yeah, it's Christmas, okay? It's a season. - Right, but this is my office and I think that this just looks a little unprofessional. Like this is moving, the head is going back and forth. - Michael look, I know you don't like Christmas. Everyone else in the world loves Christmas except for you. Okay, and it makes them feel more comfortable. - I don't dislike Christmas. This is ridiculous. - Okay, fine, fine. I'll consider taking some of the stuff down but I'm not taking all of it down. I got you the best gift to give to Sasha. - Oh God, thank you so much. What's the occasion? - She's your wife, that's the occasion. - Ah, yes, thank you. - Oh, Michael, one more thing. When are you gonna have a baby? - Don't meddle Janine. - Okay, but Michael, you keep avoiding the question. And let me tell you, that thing's not gonna work forever. See how you like being old with no kids. - And, I saved the best for last. - Santa? - No, not yet. But he was married to the bestest girl in the whole wide world, and she was a teacher and everybody loved her. - We just spelled it. - Okay, yeah, so we did. We learned it this morning, let's see if we remember. Caterpillar, what's the first thing you hear? - Cat. - Cat. - Right, okay, so we know how to spell cat, right, perfect. Then cat-e-r. - What's going on here? We have Christmas all along the left, no Christmas over here. And the principal of the school. Well, he also like liked Sasha. - And then R, like a pirate, exactly. Okay, so that my little friends is how you spell Caterpillar. Cat, like a cat. And he was really tough. - Hey, you, come over. Not that close, back up. What's your name? - Angus. - What's going on, Angus? - I only have all my posters for the annual school supply drive. We do this every year, as you can see. - Okay, that's enough, that's enough. That's great you have your flyer, really good use of the computer and your printing skills. It's very, very good. However, I'm looking at the wall here. And what I'm noticing is that there is no sign saying that this is a designated flyer zone. - No, except I also don't see a sign saying that it is not. - Right, but in order to put up flyers it has to be in a designated flyer zone, and there's unfortunately for you no sign that says this is a designated flyer zone. So why would you put up a flyer in a non flyer zone? Now, Angus ask me a question. Would you eat a cheeseburger in a hot dog zone? - No. - Would you eat a burrito in a no taco zone? - Maybe. - You should eat a burrito in no a taco zone, that was a trick question which you failed, okay. But a burrito is not a taco, so if it's a no taco zone, you can eat a burrito there. - Well, a burrito is the same thing as the taco, except. Okay so this is a taco, it curves like this, and then this is a burrito, you fold it around. - I like your energy on this topic, but you're wrong. And the point is I just see a violation here and I don't know why this sign is tilted, I don't know-- - Artistic liberties Mr. Johnson. - Principal. - No Principal Mr. Johnson. - Thank you. Yeah, you got a lot of flyers here. Angus, what's your least favorite subject? Math. - Attention to everyone, this is Principal Mr. Johnson. We are extending school hours today, an extra 45 minutes of math class for everyone. Even though you've already taken math earlier today you're doing it again. Any complaints, talk to your favorite classmate and bake sale enthusiast, Angus. Let's take these down. You see, this super cool guy didn't realize just how perfect his wife was, so they did what many mommies and daddies do. - Have a baby? See a marriage counselor. - We're leaving in 20 minutes. - Ow. - You forgot, oh my God. - I didn't, no. Can we cancel it? - No. - No. - No, we're going. - Okay, honey, it's been a long day, I've had a lot. And I have to teach tonight at eight. I have to have a big conversation with Herbie. - What about? - He wants to play softball all year round, he's crazy with it, he wants to play indoors, how do you play indoor softball? It's a winter sports. - Michael, he's your best friend, he just wants to spend time with you. - Yeah hun, but that's a little-- - I'm sensing a theme. - No. - There's a theme. - There isn't. - Herbie wants to spend time with you. I would like to spend a little bit more time with you but for some reason you just want to work and do this. - I just have a lot going on. You know, it's not that I don't want to. It's just hectic, it'll be less hectic soon, I promise. - Okay, I understand that you're stressed and I have just been very supportive of you. You started your own practice, you started teaching these night classes. I get it, the only thing that I am asking for is that we continue to see Dr. Leland, okay? Come on, I'll get your shoes. - I don't wanna make any assumptions, but. - Oh, yeah. Well, I didn't have time to change before I came. I'm sorry, but also on that note, we're gonna have to leave a little bit early because I have to change-- - He forgot about our session, again. - Now, Michael, before you respond it's important that you listen. - You do know that I am my psychiatrist as well, right? - Well, what you do is different than what I do. How has your intimacy been? - Good. - Should I be practicing my intimacy? - No, no, you shouldn't, you definitely should not be. Okay, we're gonna just skip ahead a little bit in the story, okay? Skip that. - Michael, Sasha has been very open about the fact that she'd like to have a child soon. I think you should be more receptive to that. - I'm open. The problem is that it's not possible right now, because we are busy, we were running around. You have school, you have all that actresses school stuff. - It's only impossible because you take on so much work that you avoid all of our home issues. - I have to work. Like people work, that happens. - Yeah, but your work is in your control. Right now, he just started a private practice and he's also teaching night classes. - It helps to just make sure it's consistent. I'm sorry for working. - Are you hearing Sasha, Michael? - Yes, I'm sitting right here, I hear her. - Like, are you really listening? - He's not - Yes, okay I hear you, I'm right here. - What I'm hearing from you Michael is your fear of starting a whole family. What are your feelings about that? - I do wanna start a family. - No one is saying you need to have a child tomorrow. - Right, or the next day, I just wanna hear that you're excited about it. - You know, you can't have a kid tomorrow anyway. - She wants to believe in you. - Fine, I get it, we'll start a family. - Good, now that wasn't so hard, was it? Here's what I'm going to suggest. Three nights a week, you have a date night but no alcohol, it's bad for conception. - Doctor's orders. I'm excited, aren't you excited? - Yes. So he was getting a lot of pressure and he decided he wanted to talk to her about it. And he also needed to talk to Herbie about not playing softball. - Hey. - Hey man. Hey, what's up? - Hey, you have to be on time for your appointments. - Herbie, this is lunch, this isn't an appointment and I'm like two minutes late. - Two and a half. - Two and a half. All right, sorry, fine. - So, how are things? - To be honest, I feel like I'm losing my mind. Sasha used to be so understanding about everything. And now it's, like we both agreed that starting my own practice was a good career move. And she knows I have to teach at the community college, it's a little extra money, it's a good opportunity to publish stuff and whatever. But lately all we talk about when I'm home is babies. - Wow, man, I'm really glad you came to meet me, you know. We really have to talk softball. - You didn't listen to a word I just said, did you? - No, I heard all of it. Sasha wants a kid and you're a bum. - All right, Herbie, you wanna talk softball? - Yeah. - I think that it is time to throw in the towel. We haven't won a game in five years. I mean, what are we doing out there, man? - What do you mean? I paid up front for the whole year. You want me to be on $60? It's not refundable, Michael. - I will cover the cost. - It's not about the cost, it's about friendship and teamwork. - Why don't we do something else? Why don't we get to play softball in the winter time? Tell me, to bring softball. - All right, all right, fine. Hey, just relax. - Just tell me. - Shh, just relax, we're gonna have fun and play softball. - I'm sorry, man. I love softball, man. Listen, man, I've been watching a lot of YouTube videos and my game is improving, you'll see. - The videos didn't help anything. Herbie was easily the worst softball player ever. It's chilly out my hands, it's a little limpy. Maybe it's cause I'm too quick and my arms are too strong, man. You gotta be there man. Come on, man, it's nice to have a softball, bro. - Don't do that. - I know what I'm doing. - I've seen Amish websites with more hits. - Tie goes to the runner, man. It goes to the runner. - It's softball, what are you talking about? So Herbie was terrible and Janine was really starting to get on his nerves. - Oh Michael, Michael. How was your session with Dr. Leland yesterday? - Yeah, we're not gonna do that. Fine, I don't care, I can just call Sasha and get all the dits, I don't need you. - You know, if you weren't family I'd probably fire you. - But we are family. - And because he needed to teach classes at night, things were getting a little bit strained at home. So who can tell me some of the early symptoms of schizophrenia? No? It was in the reading, nothing. Nobody, okay. You know what, this seems like a good time to wrap. So why don't we take this up next week? Thank you guys, I guess, good job. None of this is gonna be on the final anyway. So be safe, I heard that there's like a snow, so. - I've been recording all of your sessions, I have a question. - Okay. - Psychology means psycho, we're psychos? - What, psychos? - Psycho-logy. - No, no. Did you get that from tonight? Is that like a recorded thing? - Is that legal to record you? - I don't know, are you recording right now? It's just always recording me? - Hold on a second, this is not therapy. - Yeah, you're cheaper than my therapist. - We need to make this distinction. This is not therapy, this is like introduction to-- - I learned a lot in my own therapy and I learned a lot in this therapy class. I'm like a therapist already. And my mom says I should talk to you more. - Do you have any questions about the final or anything? - All right, I got what I need, I'll listen to it tonight, again. Thank you. - Professor, hey professor. - Hi, yes, Brenda how are you? - I'm good, how are you? A couple of us are going out for drinks tonight if you're interested. - Oh yeah, I would love to but my wife is home. - I was hoping to be a dancer, but I guess listen to people could be a good backup plan, 'cause, you know, I'm at a friend's house, they let me listen to them - Yeah, but my wife's at home. I can't stop for a beer, I'm sorry. - Come on, come we drink, one beer? - I can't, just one. All right, maybe just one. All right, I think I can do one. Let me hold my jacket. Which part do you guys go to? So he went out. He was just on the wrong path. - You're a little late. - Yeah, I'm so sorry, hunny. The students had a bunch of questions after class, so we stayed a little later. - Two hours of questions. - Yeah, a lot of questions. - And you've been drinking. - Yeah, some of the questions did happen at a bar. - We were supposed to have a date. Dr. Leland said three date nights a week. Once again, you just completely ignored his advice. And I told you I'm ovulating. - What's ovulating? - Look, it just means she wanted a baby. Okay, and that's what I believe, anyway. - I'm ovulating. - No, you are not. You are not. No more questions or else you guys are not gonna know the rest of the story. You're never gonna know how I met Santa. I mean, how he met Santa Claus, capeesh? - Capeesh. - Now, where was I? - She was ovulating. - Not funny, but correct. - Michael, what is going on with you? - Nothing. I just. - What? - I just don't know if I wanna have kids. At all? - At all. - But you said that you did. Why did you change your mind? Is it me? - No, no, of course not. Don't be silly, come on. I don't know. I don't know if I don't want them or if I'm not ready. Maybe it's just not the right time. - Okay. It's never gonna be the right time with you, is it? I don't know if this is gonna work. - Come on, Sasha, what are you saying, come on. Come on. Damn me. So what if I don't want kids, huh? Nobody wants kids. Kids ruin peoples lives-- Things just kept getting worse and worse and worse. - Why would you say that, Mickey, it's just gonna make her more upset. - Yes, I know. Like I told you, he's dumb. I mean he liked his life the way it was. - His life wasn't even good. - It was good. - Didn't sound that good. - Hey, I don't like this story, it has nothing to do with Santa or anything, you lied. - I did not. Well look, I'm building to it, okay, I'm getting there. - Just cut to the Santa part. - Okay, okay, everyone relax. All right, look, so that night the roads were really icy and everyone was told to stay off the roads, but he didn't listen. - Because he's dumb. - Yes, because he's dumb. So he went out for a drive, and little did he know that Santa Claus was about to change his life. Merry Christmas Michael, you should really watch the road Sasha. - Pretty cold last night, huh, Michael? I'll tell you this, if this keeps up, I'm moving to Mexico. - He was in for the surprise of his life. I'm Sorry that I'm late to paper. I had a weird 12 hours, could you cancel my three o'clock and just look up my car insurance information please. - Huh? - I'm sorry, Gary, I know you're always punctual especially 'cause the court thing I just had a strange Santa encounter last night that kind of stuck with me, so I just. - It's okay, I've plenty of runs with Santa myself. I'm not allowed at the mall anymore. - What are you doing here? Who let you in here? - Excuse me. - Janine? - What, what is it? - Oh, what's going on here? I get it, is this some kind of joke? - Are you okay? - Is this a camera show? Who put you up to this? Was it Herbie? Was it Herbie, I bet it was Herbie. Yeah, everything's fine, Janine. - That's another thing. The mall is open all year people. See, I don't need therapy. I know what sets me off, needles and lines at the mall. - Did you say needles? - Yes. - Gary? - Yes, Gary. Me, Gary, like I was saying the mall. Why does everyone only go in December? It's so dumb. - All right, seriously, what is going on? This is not funny. Where are your parents? - My parents? My parents are long gone, Michael, you knew this. Maybe we should spend a session talking about dad. Actually, maybe that's where I get it from - What, Janine, Janine. You are not Janine, you're not Janine, who are you, what's going on? You are a child. I'm gonna find Janine, I'm gonna find out exactly what's going on. Yeah, I know you're here, Janine. I can see your car, come on. - I'm right here, Michael. - This isn't funny. This is not funny, I don't know what is going on, but this is not funny. - Are you okay? Should I call Sasha? - Sasha, how do you know about Sasha? - Even I know about Sasha, you talk about her all the time. - Do you want me to cancel your day? - Yes, yes, cancel everything. Just find your parents or something. - Are you a shrink too? I think I got more to talk about today. - You can talk to yourself. - Oh my God. So like I said earlier, he hated kids and now everybody that he sees is a kid. What is going on? Hey, wow, wow, wow, what are you doing here? - What? - You don't just tear things down off the wall, weren't you supposed to be a class? - I'm sorry, man, I'm just filling in for Richie. - What, all right, you know what, what's your name? I'm gonna tell Mrs. Levitt and she's gonna tell your parents, what's your name? What's your name, I'm gonna find out. I'm gonna find out. And he was in for another big surprise. - This is Frederick, he's my bestest friend in the whole wide world. My mom gave him to me when I was just two years old. - Where is Sasha? - Frederick. - Michael, what are you doing here? - My God. - Everything is gonna be fine, just give me one second. What was that? - I don't know. I don't know what's going on, Sasha. Something's happening, something is happening right now. - You just scared an entire class of children. Are you even listening to me? - Sasha, it's kind of crazy coming from you right now. - Look, you need to leave Michael, you know, I'm up for that award and you're just gonna blow it for me by freaking out my class. Is there something wrong, can I help? - I think I need to nap, I think I need to take like a quick, can I sleep here somewhere? Maybe I could go to the nurse's office and we can take a quick nap? - What, no, you can't sleep here. - What? - Is there something we need to talk about? - Yes, we need to talk Sasha, but you're not gonna understand, it's not gonna make sense to you? - Did you get my note? - Yeah, I got your note, all right. I got the note, you don't understand what's going on. Something is happening right now, something seriously is going on. I don't know what it is but something is happening. - You're right, something is happening, I'm leaving you. - Wait, hold on, what? - It's been on my mind for a while, things aren't working. I just think we have different goals. I just wanna spend some time apart. Six-year-old, how old are How old are you, like 10? - Six-year-old? - Ow. - Real mature, Michael. Leave or I'll call school security. - Sasha, please I love you. - Well, you should've thought about that when you let me get away. - What is happening to me? - That's him. - Hey, wait there, I wanna have a word with you. - So he was in like big, big trouble. Like more than he even realized. - In with good, out with the bad. Deeper, very nice. - Oh my God, what is going on? - Michael, what are you doing here? You remember Paula, I'm stretching her out. - Herbie, I need to talk to you right now. - I don't know what we got until. Can we pick this up again next week? - It's okay, doll, I have a palates class in about 30 minutes. - Remember to do your air swings, it looks, I call it the Herbie technique. Sure. - Bye Paula. What has gotten into you, you nearly gave an old lady a heart attack? - Yeah, but Herbie that didn't look like an old woman to me. - What are you talking about, she's like 70. Hey, she may even be 90. I never checked it for her. - All right, there's something going on here, Herbie And it's a serious thing and it's crazy. It's gonna sound crazy because it is crazy, but you're a child. - Now is not the time for insults, Mikey. I have a legitimate career going here. I don't barge into your office and assault you. - What, well, you do actually do that. - Is true, but I don't make it so personal. - No, no, no, you don't understand, you literally look like a child. - I don't follow you. - You look like you're six years old. - That's ridiculous. - All right, well, what do I look like to you? - You look crazy, Michael. That's what you look like. - Yeah, I know I look crazy, but do I look like an adult? - Did you hit your head or something? - No, okay look, it doesn't make any sense, but this morning I woke up and everybody that I've seen has been a child. All right, and my patients, Janine, Sasha, and now you. - I don't have time for this. All right, that's actually kind of weird. - Yeah, and I tried to tell Sasha at school she said she's gonna leave me. - I'm sure she'll take you back, you're an okay guy. - I'm sorry, but I can't take you seriously looking like this, you look exactly like you did when we were kids. I'm Sorry, can we do like a. We do back to back. Can we back to back please? - I know. Herbie, I think that the cops might be looking for me. I was doing some weird stuff at Sasha school today. I don't know, I think they're following me. - And you came here? I don't want the police sniffing around my totally normal practice. - Herbie, can we just focus, please. I mean, come on, am I crazy, am I losing my mind? - I could give you a sedative. - I guess one couldn't hurt, right? Yeah. - Things might start to get a little fuzzy in the next few hours. - Wait, what drug did I give you? Hey, Hey, how many fingers am I holding up? - I have a really hard time following what you're saying to me. Herbie? - Feeling any better? You took a pretty nasty fall, I would've gotten you some ice, but I didn't wanna leave you alone. - I think you gave me too much. - It may have been the wrong pill. But it got the job done, right? - No, it didn't get the job done. You're still a child and I'm still crazy. God, this is like a bad dream that will never end. - I'm officially stumped then. - Oh my God. - Merry Christmas Michael, you should really watch the road. - Santa Claus. - You might have a concussion my brother. No, no, no. Herbie, Santa Claus was the last person that I saw. I remember we went out last night and I was driving and then it was a reindeer and Santa waved, And that was the last thing I remember. - Was Santa Claus a child too? No, no, no, he was the last adult I saw. - You know what this means, Michael? - We're going to the mall. - So he needed things to go back to normal, and to do that, he needed to find Santa. - All of them? - All of them. - Wow, that's a lot of kids. - All right, let's go get our Santa. Oh no. - Santa too? - Yeah, I still need to talk to him. Sorry guys, excuse me. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - Hey, watch it. - I'm sorry, we really need to speak with Santa. - And then I want a train set and a basketball and a laptop and a pony, and a razor scooter and a hoverboard. - That's too many requests. - Hey, back off buddy. - No, no, no, you don't understand, we really need to talk to Santa. - You gotta wait your turn. - No, no, no, this is an emergency. - It's okay. - Thank you, Santa. Look, I just need to know if it was you. - Ho, ho, ho, you must take a seat. - You want me to sit on your lap? - That's right. I am Santa Claus after all. - Yeah, but aren't I gonna like crush you? - Just sit on my fricking lap man, the kids are watching. - Okay. - There, isn't that better? - Yeah, sure. Yeah, look Santa, I just need to know was it you? - Was what? - Did you do this to me? Santa, I saw you on the street last night, you told me to keep my eyes on the road. - Yeah, okay, you need to get up. Santa, doesn't do crazy people. - So you're saying you didn't do this to me. - Security. - No, no, no, you don't understand. You don't understand me. No, we're not taking the puppy. So all day, they kept looking for Santa. The neighborhood was a small town, there weren't that many Santas, so, all of the ones they found were kids. - Sorry Mikey, maybe we can try again tomorrow. - Yeah, I don't even know where else to look for him. - We'll figure that out tomorrow, okay. Just hang in there, buddy. - Santa. - Huh? - Sorry. Sorry, I'll try and keep down. - Hello, Michael. - Santa. - Come over, let's have a little chat, huh, I'm sure you have a lot of questions for me. - Just tell me, was it you? - Of course, yeah, weird, huh? - Yeah, it's really weird. Why are you ruining my life, Santa? Santa doesn't ruin people's lives. Sasha left me, man. I can't go to the mall, I got kicked out of school, the cops are looking for me. My practice, I'm gonna lose my practice, - Because-- - Why? - Why, because I'm seeing kids, who's gonna take me seriously? - Have you even stopped to think for one second of why this might be happening to you, Michael? - I don't know, maybe I'm not Christmas-y enough for you. - Oh, that's rich. Christmas isn't about who is or isn't Christmas-y enough. Christmas is one day a year, one day out of the whole year. - Right, that's just one day. So, I mean, I'm not following. - What do you mean you're not following? Things happen for a reason. Look at me, for a reason. You say I ruined your life, but I don't see you taking any blame for what's happening. - I did not decide to just see kids one day. I didn't want that, I didn't ask for that. I wasn't like I was sitting there being like, hey I want more kids in my life, this is great. - You know what, you'll figure it out. I'm famished, so, hey you know a good cookie place around here? - Cooking place? What are you talking about cookie place, you need to fix this. - I like the big chocolate. - So you're not gonna tell me how to fix this? What is so funny? - Where will the fun be in that? - Fun? - Yeah. Listen, come on let's go, get out of my sleigh, out of the sleigh. - No, I'm not getting out of the sleigh, you fix this, you need to fix this. - Out of the sleigh. - I'm not getting out of the sleigh, fix it. - Get out of the sleigh, Michael, I'm hungry. - All right, what am I supposed to do? - Ah, come on, you'll be fine. I'll catch you later. - Hey, hey, whoa whoa whoa. * I have to get some cookies, maybe some scones, * * I'm so hungry I can't wait to eat 'em, * * Santa's hungry, whoa! - Really, oh wow, you have a lot to learn, Michael. - I'm calling the police. - So finding Santa obviously did not solve his problem. Actually, it kind of made things worse. - You know I got a call. What are you in for? - You wouldn't believe me if I told you. - Been there man, Maurice. - Michael. - I've seen a lot in my day. I think I saw a santa in here once. - In jail? - We all have bad days. - I think Santa is like trying to teach me a lesson or something. - Sounds to me like he's looking out for you, Michael. - What are you, like one of his helpers or something? - I wish, I think I'd make a great elf, but no, I just think there's something beautiful about Christmas. I just wish I could get out of here and spend it with my family like I was supposed to. - Santa wants to see how Christmas-y I can be, huh? That's what he wants, he wants to see me be Christmas. He doesn't even know how Christmas I can get. I can be Christmas, I am Christmas. - Be careful. - Maurice, I think you just saved my life. - Hey, happy to help you out, Michael. Now, if you'll excuse me. - Oh God, oh God. - Goodman, you've made bail. - Finally. - Stay away from the mall and schools for the next 30 days, okay? - Done, who posted my bail? Was it Santa Claus? So, it was actually Herbie who came to his rescue. - I don't need my college fund. - College fund, you don't have a college fund, you already went to college. - You think I wanna stay a physical therapist forever? Okay, anyway, I think we should go to - No, Herbie, I don't have time, I got to show Santa who's boss. - Okay, no problem, what's the plan? - Christmas lights, come on. - This was nice. - Yeah, it's nice. Santa's gonna have to turn things back now. All right, are you ready? I don't know, here we go. - I think I'm temporarily blinded, and, yes, it's too much. - Hey Bob, what do you think? - What do I think, you wanna know what I think? I think it stinks. - All right, Merry Christmas. - Hey Bob. - All right, let's get our Santa. - Hey Mikey, you suck at decorating. - Come on Santa, where are you? Maybe we could go to. - Not now, Herbie. Come on, you say I'm not Christmas-y enough, I've got every Christmas light in town. We've been setting stuff up all day, my fingers are numb. Come on Santa, I am Christmas. I am Christmas. - Mikey, I don't think that's what Santa wants. - Shut up, Herbie, I am Christmas. So he tried everything. No matter what he tried, he couldn't get Santa to come back. So, he realized he didn't need more decorations, he needed something else. Huh? I mean, that's gotta be it. - It is great. - It's good, right? - You know, Mikey, maybe you're trying a little too hard. - I'm doing exactly what Santa told me to do, okay. - It's just, you think that maybe you're going a little overboard? - Overboard, no, I mean, Christmas is about cheer. It's about decorations, it's about-- - But it doesn't mean anything if you don't actually care, Mikey. Look, I'm happy to see you in the spirit. It's just, do you really want to be doing this? - Want to be doing this? No, I don't wanna be doing this for me. I want my life back, that's what I want. I want my life back, this is some stupid,, just cruel joke. I mean, so what. Yeah, I focused on my career, I want to be better. Is that so bad? - You know I'm not saying that. - Well, you've said enough. Either you're helping or you're not. - I mean, I have enjoyed spending time with you for the past few days. - Great, well, I'm glad that you're enjoying yourself, Herbie, because my life is literally falling apart while you're enjoying yourself. - Dude, you know that's not what I mean. I just like hanging out with you. You know what, Mikey, you're a bad friend. You deserve all of this. I hope you get whatever it is you're looking for. - Your son has been up since six in the morning waiting for his father to open presents. Who is that? Don't tell me you're still in Baltimore, I want-- - Can I open just one? - Don't you wanna wait until your father gets home? - But I waited all day. - Okay, but just one. - I love it, when his dad gonna be home to play catch? - He wants to honey, but he has to work. - But it's Christmas. Why would he get me a glove if he isn't gonna play with me? - Oh my God. I've turned into my dad. I never wanted to be. And so he finally realized what he had to do. And it was to undo all the bad stuff he had done, and that started with Sasha. - Oh my God Michael, I heard about Sasha. - How did you hear about Sasha? - I text her every day. - Of course you do. - And I heard you went to jail. Your life is falling apart. - Well, that's a little bit blunt. - I don't wanna say I told you so, but I did say she wanted a baby. - All right, enough. I appreciate everything-- - Come here. Let your aunt make you feel better. - Okay. - I used to do this to your dad all the time, you'll love it. - I do, okay, actually not too bad. - Are you okay? - Oh, yeah, sorry, I'm just waiting for somebody. - Me too, mind if I sit? - Sure. - No work today? - It's kind of a long story. I guess I'm taking some time off. - Well, it's good to take time off from stuff, clear your head and realize what's important. - Yeah. I guess I've been focusing on the wrong stuff lately, you know. - Yeah, it's tough to keep up with everything, but in the end, work is just work you know, it's not really that important. - Yeah, you're right. - All right, well, see you mister, have a great day. - So it was pretty clear, Sasha didn't wanna take him back. - Michael, I'm sorry that the rabbits didn't work out, but maybe the rabbits really sends the wrong message. - Why? - Well, rabbits have a lot of babies, it's like going from zero babies to 10 babies, you know what I'm saying? She may just need time, or maybe it's not meant to be. But either way, you need to decide what you want. - All right, you win Santa, you were right the whole time. I've been selfish and I just don't get it. - Finally, you admit it. - Hey, how'd you know I'd be here? - Like you were gonna fix this problem on your own. - I've been a bad friend. - I agree, the worst friend. - You wanna have a catch? - I can't stay mad at you. - All right here, now grab this, put this on. We're gonna do it, all right. Now eye on the ball, all right. I'm sorry, man, I really am, I was a bad friend. So let me, all right, eye on the ball. So once you put your left hand, eye on the ball and then just push it to, push it to the ball. You know what I mean, like, are you ready? Okay, here we go. Wow, all right. It's okay, that was closer. Here we go, try this one, ready? Hey. - It worked. - Yeah, nice job. Nice job. - Look Mikey, I hope everything changes back for you. - Yeah, me too Herbie, me too. But even if it doesn't, I'll still be here. - I don't know about you, but I could go for like 20 tacos right now. - Why don't we settle for 10, huh? - Okay. - Head right, catch. - Don't do it. What are you doing, why would you do that? All right, let's go get the ball. I don't know, man, maybe Sasha and I just aren't meant to be together. - Are you kidding me? You two are like the best couple I've ever known. - Yeah, if there was an award for best wife she'd win every time. - How would voting work for in a world like that? Seems tough. - Yeah, you know she's actually up for an award right now. Most promising teacher, the ceremony is in like a couple hours. - You gotta be there. - No man, it would ruin everything if I went. - It will ruin everything if you're not there. - You know Herbie, you might be right. - I've got a plan. - So yeah, Herbie had a plan, but nobody said it was a good plan. - So, did you understand the plan? - I guess, I mean, what was the plan? - Okay, we go through it again. When we enter the school, we split up. I'll head to the gym where the awards are taking place. Now, we give you enough time to make your move. Principals always get a little jumpy during events, so he'll be doing a lot of checking up. - I think you'll be very happy with your results. - That's very exciting. - Once he sets his glass down, that's when I make my move. - I'm just gonna make sure we're on schedule, I'll be right back. - While I keep the principal busy, that's when you take care of the janitor. Once the glass is clear, that's when I spike it with the laxative. Okay, yeah, just remember, one drop, this stuff is potent. - Hey. Who did that? - Excuse me. Excuse me, how much longer is this going to be? Excuse me. - Excuse me. - I'm bored and when I'm bored I get anxious, and when I'm anxious, I talk a lot. I'm like I talk a lot and people get mad at me. - I'm kind of busy right now. - I have to go to the bathroom and I really really need to go. - Stop talking for a minute, please. - Can you take me, I need a teacher to take me. - I'm not a teacher. You know, you can do it by yourself, it's not that hard. - Then who are you? You know I talk to a teacher. You're not allowed to be-- - Hey, okay look, I got to go but good luck with the bathroom thing though. - But I need to go to the bathroom, and I need you to entertain me. - Hey, let me in. - The laxative should kick in quickly. I'll stick to the principal like glue till he has to go back. Once he's out of the gym, that's when you go to Sasha. - Hey he's the one who made my turtle, Frederick runaway. - Sorry about the turtle thing, you know, Frederick. - Michael. - Hi Sasha. Sorry, I know that this is probably the worst thing that I could possibly do right now, but I just, I know this is important to you and I just I wanted to be here and there's no other way that I could, you know be here. - Hey, who are you? - I just wanted to tell you, I know that it's been a really weird week, like weirder than you can ever even imagine. I guess we can talk about that another time. But look, I just want you to know that I love you. I love you more than anything. And I, wow, so so many kids. - You're doing great. - Thank you. Sasha, I don't know why this has been so hard for me to tell you this in the past, but I don't know, I guess I always thought it was obvious, you know how I felt about you? - You're helping him, aren't you? - No. - Get out of my way. Christmas and Christmas we tell people how we really feel. - This ends now. - No no, I can explain it. I can explain. - You're going straight to jail, I called the cops. - I'm just trying to tell my wife that I love her. Hello, hello, hello. Hey, Sasha, I just wanna say I'm sorry. I acted like a jerk, I just thought if I worked hard - Hey, what are you doing? Get out of here, now. Hey, what are you doing here? I'm sorry. - I'm so sorry about that kids. - I'm coming, Michael. - Hey, stop there. Oh, that's the hammie. - That's him. - Come on, in here. - I know he's here, I can smell him. - That's weird. - Don't talk to me like that. - Surprise. - You always knew how to make an entrance. - Yeah, look I'm sorry, I know you didn't want me to call, but I needed to see you. - I got the rabbits. - I know, I was watching from the bushes. - And I was watching you from the window. It was sweet, I just, I needed some time. - I know. - I drove by the house the other day. You really went for it with the decorations. - Yeah, I don't know what got into me, I kind of went overboard. - Yeah, I would say so. - I'm really sorry, I hope that this doesn't affect you getting that award. I know how much it means to you. - Are you gonna tell me what's really going on? - Yeah, I can, but I got to tell you, it's unbelievable and I swear to God that this is true. Since we had that fight the other night, everybody that I've seen has been a child. Everyone, you, Herbie. And the craziest part is that Santa Claus is the one that did it to me. - Michael, are you okay? - No, no, I'm not okay. I haven't been okay for a long time. And it's crazy that this ordeal is what it took for me to realize that. - Them too? - That's right. - I'm sorry, I can just only imagine them with their little construction hats. I believe you. - You do? - You were never a good liar. - You know the craziest thing is that this is probably the best thing that's happened to me in a long time. I mean, other than you, of course. - Hey lovebirds, I'm happy you two met up, but Mikey, we have a serious situation out there. Security is looking for us and the principal is not a happy camper. - Yeah, we should probably go. - Yeah, hi Sasha. - You two go, I'll stall them. - Nobody takes us down, right Mikey? - That's right, Herbie. - Bye Sasha. - So he was on top of the world until. - Get him. - I'm sorry Mikey. - So tight, man. Thanks. - Did I tell you to stay away from schools? - Yeah, you did. - Hello Michael. - Hey Santa. Where's the suit? - Dry clean it, it's getting ready for the big day. I'm a bit of a slob, Mrs. Claus never lets me forget it. - Looks like you're missing. - Oh yeah, yeah. I told you, I'm a bit of a slob. That's milk, thank God. All right, well, I still wonder why she stayed with me all these years. - So I guess I owe you an apology. - Yeah, that'd be nice. - I don't know what came over me. I thought I was doing everything right. I thought my life was what I wanted and where I wanted to be. And the truth of the matter is that I hate that version of myself. - Well, even a Grinch has to be taught a lesson every once in a while. - I was kind of a Grinch, huh. - The biggest Grinch. You were a Grinch, you were the biggest Grinch since the Grinch. You're worse than my grandmother. She was the original Grinch, did you know that? And the decorations, oh my God. I mean, Christmas isn't about who puts up the most decorations. - You know, I know that. And they were just bad, bad, I'm sorry. - Well, I wanted to tell you, Mike, I really did. I did, but I just thought it'd be better if you figured it out on your own. - I understand. - Now, I bet you're wondering if your time's almost up, huh? - Well, yeah. - You've done well, Michael, you've done well. And this has just been a little taste. - Taste? How much more do we have? - A taste of the greatest gift of all. - You know, I never believed in you growing up. My mom had to try and convince me every single year, and I just, I told her it was impossible. - Yeah, well, you sound like every other kid nowadays. That's what bugs me. It's like I don't understand, when did believing become such an issue? - I mean, it is a little bit of crazy. - What, it's crazy, so what? I ride around the world in a reindeer powered sleigh, what else do you people want? - I guess it just comes down to the gifts, you know. - That's right, all the gifts. Jeez gifts, everybody thinks I bring toys and things. I wanna let you in on a little secret. Every year I give people the greatest gift of all. You wanna know what that is? - Yeah. - Family, your family. Got to see it to believe it kid. - Yeah, I hope I do. - I think you just might. - Gotta go, woo big day. I hope everything goes well for you Michael and Merry Christmas. - Where are you going, we're in jail. So he hoped things were back to normal and he just needed to see one person, just one person. And, well, they're still kids. Sasha? Sasha, I can't tell you how good it is to see you. - You've only been gone like an hour. - I know, but it doesn't feel like it. - What happened to your face? - I'm okay, I'm okay. But look, I just want to say I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry for everything. Anything I ever said to you, I was wrong. I'm always wrong, you're always right. - What's going on? - Nothing, look, I've been thinking about it a lot and the truth is I'm excited. I'm really, I just can't wait. - What happened to you? - It's a long story. - Okay, well, I'm still mad at you. - Okay, that's okay. And so that's how it happened. That is the truth about Santa Claus. - Wait, what, I don't get it. What's the truth about Santa Claus and what did he give him? - Well, santa doesn't just give you things, like he gives you a gift. - It sounds like he didn't give him anything. He just messed with him. - Oh no, no, no, Santa gives the best gifts in the whole wide world. - Like what? - Like what? - Daddy. - Hey, how are you at home, I thought you had school today? You guys almost done? - Can you give us a minute, Sasha. - We have a lot to wrap up here still. - One second, honey. Okay, I'll see you later, go. - Bye. - Okay, sorry about that guys. Anyway, so, where were we? - Seriously after all that, you're still not gonna tell us what he gave him. - I mean, look, I think I kind of tell you guys, but I guess it's just a secret that you have to understand when you're older. But I can tell you this, it will change your life forever. - Forever? - Come on, tell us, what's the secret? - I can't just tell you guys the secrets of Santa Claus. He gets so mad at me. But I can tell you this, it is the best gift that you will ever get. - Better than ovulating? - Sasha has been very honest about the fact that she'd like to have a child soon. And I think you should be a little more receptive to that. - Michael, I'm sorry that the rabbits didn't work out, but maybe the rabbits really sends the wrong message. - Freezing my buns up. Hey speaking of buns, I got a donut here my son gave me, you want a piece? Nice chocolate donut, I'm gonna get out of my pocket. - And then we're done after this. - I got a donut here, you want a piece of donut? We gotta go bob, sorry. - Pretty cold last night, huh Michael? I'll tell you this, if this keeps up I'm moving to Mexico. - I can slide. Head slide, leg slide. Huh, you know what I mean? - YouTube is good man, you need to get into that, man. And the foot slide like, and pop slide, got that thousands of time, kept watching it, yeah. Going long, bring me deep. Cheater. You pitched it weird. It should've been right there, come on man. It must be the thunder, I don't know, maybe it's the thunder in my arm. That's it. - In with good, out with bad. - Is this supposed to hurt? - I don't know, is it? Oh, you might have a concussion my brother. Cut. - That's a cut. - C-A-T, er - E, R. - Okay, Pill. P-I-L-L. A, R. - Exactly, okay. And that my little friends is how you spell Caterpillar. - Everything's going to be fine, just give me one second. - I think that I need to take a nap. You think I can sleep here, - What, no, you can't sleep here. - What are you like six year old, how old are you, how old are you, like 10? - Six-year-old? - Ow. - Real mature Michael. - Would you eat a cheeseburger in a taco zone? - Those things have no relation whatsoever. - Answer the question. Would you eat a burrito in a no taco zone? Let's focus on the flyers. Okay, you just put your flyers on the ground, which is also a permanent no flyers zone, which means it's littering. - Well, is there a littering zone? - Yeah, it's called a trashcan. Hold on a second, Maurice, what are you doing? You're just standing there. You can mop more than one spot, it doesn't have to just be that one spot. You know there's a whole hallway here. This is not a no mop zone, it's just a, the entire thing is a mop zone. - Hey, what are you doing? Get out of here, now. - Don't meddle? Did you just say don't meddle? That thing's gonna turn to metal if you don't use it. Oh, so miserable. I know it's like a miserable. I mean, don't you think maybe he should go with the mood, you know. So I said, if you stop asking so many questions then you will stop getting. Exactly, ignorance is bliss. Oh wait, hold on, hold up. Michael, Michael, do not go. - And just look up my car insurance information, please. - What? Huh? - Can you look up my car insurance information, please. - Huh? - Oh no, you have a lot to learn, Michael. Come on, let's get some cookies. Cookie, cookie, cookie, woo. Yeah, you're worse than my grandmother. She was the original Grinch, did you know that? That's where you got the whole story from. Helga, Helga Sockwater, that was her name. Oh man, she was Chelsea, Massachusetts. Terrible woman. Just every Christmas. What's this, what's that, where are we going? I mean, we moved her to a mountain top. She grew whiskers. Then somewhere in the story made her green, blah, blah, blah, blah blah. - Did I tell you to stay away from schools? - Yeah, you did. - Hi Michael. - Help, if he thought I needed help why did he send me to therapy? What are you looking at? I didn't drive here. I'm a really nice guy. I really, I mean, it's just that she never warned me that the needle was coming in. Last I checked, you're supposed to warn a guy. I mean, she didn't do that, right, right? - Like I was saying, the mall. Why do people only go in December, it's so dumb. - I will find out how tall you are, believe me. - Hey, back off buddy. - No, no, you don't understand, we really need to, we really need to talk to Santa. I don't know, maybe I'm not Christmas-y enough or something. - Oh, that's it, maybe you're not Christmas-y enough. What's wrong with you? - I don't know. - Christmas isn't about whose Christmas-y. - Is this the best daddy. - How are you? All right, I'll see you in just a second. - Bye. - We'll just be a second, okay. I'll see you in a bit.
