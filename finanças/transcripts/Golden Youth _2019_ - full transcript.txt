Don't worry. We'll get our revenge on those assholes one day. There's no justice. Your best move is to forget. I'll never forget you though. Look. Your sweetheart's here. Hey, Michel! Lucky you. It's been a long two years. But the judge can see Michel is a fine young man. Responsible. And your mother has agreed to let you be with him even though you're 17. Letting you two spend weekends and Wednesdays afternoons together worked well. You're enrolled at the Paris school. Pastry chef. Good career. Makes kids happy, as you said. Show up for classes and stay out of trouble. Remember you're responsible for her. #NAME? Absolutely, sir. Goodbye. Rose... #NAME? #NAME? If you love me, it's for life. Say you love me. I love you for life. Oh Michel... I love you so much. Great to see you! Ordeal's over. Kermit the Frog and Miss Piggy. Stop, Adrien! #NAME? We owe two months rent. Electricity's down in the kitchen. We plugged in on the landing. Hey Rose! #NAME? #NAME? #NAME? C'mon, make us laugh. Yvan and I got drunk at the Rothschilds. He pissed on the curtains. #NAME? Gross! When I left, he was bawling. Now he hates me. He told Razerka I called her Thunder Thighs. Now she wants to break my face. How dumb. I made great costumes for their show. Their loss. #NAME? Let's go! #NAME? Yeah, why? #NAME? #NAME? Big time. Michel and Rose, strike a pose! Good evening! Good evening, my loves! I'm thrilled to see you here at our fabulous Monsters and Marvels Ball! And now... Let the party begin! - Who's she? - Rose. Michel's girlfriend. #NAME? Yeah! #NAME? Shut up! See the new bag her sugar daddy got her! Wow, a Kelly! It's real, from Herms. I could never be a whore. How do you know? Ever tried? - Don't talk if you don't know. - You're wild. What about you? I was told gigolos wear tracksuits and turn their matchboxes upside down. I tried it one night, but no luck! You could turn tricks? I don't buy it. Hey, Yvan! Hi, doll-face! Your mariachi costume is super fly! Do you all realize we're about to enter the awful 80s? Freaky, too freaky. So Razerka, Adrien calls you Thunder Thighs? Drop it. Where is that rat? I'll break his face. He's dead meat. You're a raging rampage. Here comes Lucille. Good evening, baby loves. You're gorgeous. Hi, Michel. Let's dance. Come on! Come. #NAME? Leave me be! Would you have my baby? Yeah, someday. I mean, ideally. Ideally, of course I would. We could go to the country sometimes. Just us two. For a change. What do you think? Tell me. Sure, why not. Wanna see my new shadow puppet? Yeah! #NAME? Too cool! Look out, I'm gonna eat you! Let's play Lions and Martyrs! C'mon! Michel! Hold me tight! We'll be ok. You'll be a great artist. We danced like mad. It was divine. Why'd you leave? She's so pretty. Her little mug reminds me of a Pekinese. #NAME? I'm not your dog. Show me the thing. What thing? - What's going on? - Lucille's buying a drawing. Why didn't you tell me? Don't make a scene. For once he's got a buyer. She's right. Here's an advance. Bye-bye! What's the story? Why didn't you tell me? Why? She ordered it. I wanted to surprise you. Surprise me how? I thought you weren't gonna sell till you found a gallery? - You said you wanted to focus! - We need money! Don't look at me that way. Please. I never imagined you'd lie to me like this. We had no secrets. Lighten up. You'll drive me crazy. I'm doing it for you. Miss? The social worker said to come here every month for financial aid until I turn 18. #NAME? #NAME? Who's that Lucille sniffing around Michel? One of Adrien's finds. A rich broad, one of Mugler's muses. She got a guy? She's married to Hubert Aubert. A gorgeous writer. Filthy rich too. They have a country mansion and stay at the H™tel Meurice in Paris. What's so funny? I'm picturing you in a chef's hat with pastries! I won't go. Careful or they'll send you back. Michel's cool, but he's cursed. A starving artist. You've had it rough. You need a successful guy. Why do you say that? I love him. Most chicks would understand. I'm not most chicks. Stop being so cynical. I'm not cynical. I'm realistic, sweetheart. If you don't shake things up, nothing'll happen. You can't live on an occasional ad. What'll you do with your life? Fashion. Remember when we were 10, in the woods? You held my hand. I thought you were in love. What're you doing? Goofing around. #NAME? #NAME? Yvan! Quit horsing around! My dad still thinks I'm straight. Fucking wild! Hey, look! - It's us! - Yeah, me and Yvan. #NAME? Look, you too. Here's me and Michel! Rose. My suit. What do you think? High class. I can't believe you spent all Lucille's money on that. Thanks. She looks like a bitch. Lucille still owes me a lot. Give me your foot. Later I'll get two ribs removed like Jayne Mansfield. For a smaller waist. I love it when you paint my nails. Michel? Are you mine? Yes. Come... The youth center called, you have to go back. Why do you say that? No way, you're shitting me! Tell me it's not true! - No! - You can't leave me! Sorry, it was a stupid joke. How dare you? You're my only friend, Michel! Hold me tight. I'm too wiped to dance. Fine. Let's vote on the freakiest guys. Sounds good. Mister Muscles! Total freak. Maximum freak! So hippy dippy! - Who's he? - That's Hubert. As freak as he is chic. - He's ancient. - You bitch! You're popular. Fabrice wants you to perform solo at the next ball. #NAME? Say yes! Say yes! A gift from Hubert. Beautiful, right? Gorgeous. #NAME? #NAME? Of course they're real. Diamonds. Let's do a group photo of all us friends! Yeah! Michel... Rose, c'mon. Hurry up. Looking good, Michel. Come stand next to me. Do as you're told. Don't just stand there. C'mon! Let's pretend we're wasted. You hurt me! You stepped on my shoes, bitch! I feel faint! Please don't die. Recognize us? Lift her up. Take me. Michel, save me! Michel? Hold her hand. There's heroin in there. #NAME? Fuck off! Damn, this gets me off so hard. Let's go. Michel, take Lucille home. Her purse was stolen. Bad trip. No shit. When'd you introduce them? You're a drag when you're wasted. Does Michel know? Look at Adrien. Such a brown noser! And a tragic toy boy in a bellboy jacket. It's freezing. Everybody in! Come on. Get a load of this pad! Come! Cut it out. I love you, baby. Sleep well? Well enough. I saw you at the Palace last night. You seemed so sad. Do you like art? Of course you do, silly me. You're in love with a painter. Have you known Michel long? Since Lucille got smitten with him. About a month, I think. What's smitten mean? To acquire an extreme, irrational taste for someone. Lucille fancies herself a supporter of young artists. Playing Marie-Laure de Noailles, the great art patron. Don't worry, it never lasts. Will she damage him? Know the origin of the word smitten? No. It used to mean contaminated, like when one rotten fruit spoils another. Beware of spoiled children. So you're a big brain? You're very studious, Mademoiselle. What are you looking at? This old photo... She looks a bit like you. You both have the eyes of a martyr. A woman thrown to the lions. Come. I'll show you something you'll like. How beautiful! Go on up. Get on stage. Stop ogling my gams. No Tomorrow This isn't a play. No, it's a novel. It's the story of a perverse woman who kidnaps a young man and takes him to a house of mirrors in the country. It's beautiful. Keep it. Keep the Kleist book too. #NAME? #NAME? I keep them in millet. So they stay beautiful and shiny. Enjoy inspecting my room? Sure, of course. Those are vitamins. I bought them in New York. Ever been to New York? No. You're kidding? It's my dream. See these? They're very old sheets. Handmade. Ever slept in sheets like these? I don't know. Come fasten my dress? Stay with me, pretty blue eyes. Stay! Michel... Let go of me. Finish the portrait series at least. Michel! You promised me. Doesn't Lucille look like a Botticelli? Yes. She's got the diaphanous skin. She looks like Proust's Odette. I love it! What is love, deep down? What is it? Melting into each other until you become one. Like inseparable magnets. Passionate love. Devoting yourself body and soul. Being utterly faithful, for in sacrifice we attain ideal love. It's Gainsbourg. I love you. Me neither. Or Boris Vian. Hurt me, Johnny. Or maybe it's platonic love? Or maybe loving, in the end... is fooling oneself. That's why it's so exciting. You never really know. Lucille is divine. Rose. What does love mean to you? Being prepared to die if betrayed. No... There is no betrayal between lovers. - Michel, what do you think? - Leave us alone! Hubert and I have no taboos. That's the point of education, modernity, freedom. You'll frighten them. Hubert and I loved each other madly. We fucked wherever we pleased. My father kicked us out of Switzerland. When we married, Lucille gave me Balilme. I love this house. I hope to die here. Come to the Mugler show tomorrow at the Meurice. I'll stay in the room. I hate shoulder pads. Lucille, I'll make you a She-Devil for the Metamorphosis Ball. You wanted to make Rose a silverware dress once. #NAME? No, go on! I love old war stories. We were at a film party at the Grand VŽfour. She was half-naked in her waterlily bra. We dug the silverware, so... I stuffed it in my coat. I looked like the Michelin man! We fled on our scooters. The cops rounded us up. 42 You were scared. You'd escaped your retard place. We weren't retards! #NAME? #NAME? At least we escaped! The cops arrested you and took you back. He was on all fours, begging! I begged them for mercy! "I've never stolen anything before! I'll rot in jail!" #NAME? #NAME? He'd stolen chains from a store. Why? So he could dress up as a dog for Karl's party. Am I right? Rose... Hubert could've written that story. He hasn't written in 20 years. Not since I met you. Shit, my dress! #NAME? I'll loan you one. Come. Don't fuck my man! Is that clear? Do you fancy Hubert? He's got a nice cock. And he knows how to use it. You should try him. Why are you so jumpy? Relax, it's just us girls. We can talk. I want to change clothes. Can't we talk? Hands off. Keep away. What's wrong? You know, Michel, I think we fell in love too young, too hard. Maybe we should break up. I'll go see my parents. I'll ask for a job at their store. Why? I'm responsible for you. I'll stop painting. You're a loser. For once you had something going. Do you really mean that? You know Johnny Thunders? He's my favorite singer. Let's drink champagne in my room. For real... what would you pay me to sleep with you? I don't know. 3,000? 4,000 francs. #NAME? Is that all? Gimme more. #NAME? I'm all out. Why do you ask? No reason. To see a sucker's money! Just kidding. I love hotel rooms in the afternoon. The contrast between the activity outside and the plush, vaguely dusty silence within. When my mother was modelling for Balenciaga, I'd read for hours in the room. How old were you? About your age now. Paris was beautiful in the early 50s. I remember the lights outside the Ritz. I drank whiskey even then. With Americans. I read Hemingway. Rose, are you planning to rob me? Look, but don't touch. Ever had sex at a hotel? No. You're not the hooker type. There are two kinds of girls. Wallet girls, who know how to ask for money. And romantics, who don't. The second kind is far more exciting. Really? I smell fear. Shame. Disgust. Teenage girl sweat... If you cry, I'll get hard. Let go. It was so hot at that fashion show! And so sensational! I thought I'd die. What's this? #NAME? #NAME? #NAME? Because I'm in love with her. She's crazy about her painter. As she should be! He's special. So endearing. Is he a good painter? He has talent. This is Little Neal. I told you about her. Go on. Rose's satchel! Out with your menagerie. Depraved youth is a bore. Rose? Where the hell have you been? I met Johnny Thunders. #NAME? #NAME? #NAME? #NAME? It's simple. I didn't see my parents. The car broke down. I've had it. I'm suffocating. Rose! I'm so sad. I feel like dying. I should have a gallery by now. It's not fair. No one takes me seriously, I'm going mad. I need to meet people, get some momentum. Then we'd be happy. Lucille could help you. She has the means. It'd be dumb not to take advantage. And I think she enjoys it. She buys the portraits for her own face. You're such a coward. You never decide. Why'd you take my satchel to Michel? Did you fuck Hubert? None of your beeswax. You should thank me for the cash flow. Spot me some, share! Get off my back. Rose is naive. She thinks Hubert is Prince Charming. He's no aristocrat. Just a washed-up gigolo. My parents gave me some money. It's cool. Did you see what Lucille sent you? Aren't you happy? You're a drag when you're like this. Go make me a G&T. With Curaao. Blue. Really? That's wild! It's Hubert Aubert. See you tonight, then. He invited us for Chinese. - What's he after? - He has a nice cock, I hear. You're crazy. What's wrong with you? The landlord wants the rent. Cough it up. So, baby whores, how's business tonight? You're late. Bravo for the clothes. Not bad. Ultra glam! We're playing the truth game. What terrifies you? It's Lucille's turn. So, what terrifies me most... And I know this is wrong and terrible... I had a friend who had a serious accident. She jumped out her window but didn't die right away. I knew she needed me, but... I couldn't go, because... the idea of seeing her handicapped and in distress terrified me. How can you say such awful things? My first wife jumped out a window over you. Lucille's right. Who here would befriend a paralytic? Or even a bum? No one befriends your bum. Certainly not you! Your turn, Pacadis. My biggest fear is finding a club when the Palace is gone. You'll go day-clubbing, my dear Pacadis. We'll all die and go to Paradisco. And you, Rose? What terrifies you? Being naked under my dress! I'm off to get my cigars. And me, my cigs. What terrifies you, Michel? I'm afraid of premonitions. Last night I dreamt Rose left me. Don't be silly, honey. You're far too cute together. We'll watch over you. #NAME? Shit, where is it? - Well, I wonder! - What a star-crossed pair! Star-crossed lovers are beautiful. Here, darling. Thank you! Meet you at the Palace. Hubert has opium. Interested? Why not? I've never tried. What's gotten into me tonight? Must be a full moon. You're positively superb, Hubert, as Martha Graham. Did you know Hubert slept with Nureyev? A youthful mistake! Put on a slow song. The life of the artist! My cousin never did dishes either. He threw the dirty ones out. He threw out the silver the Tsarina gave our great-grandmother. We're more the kind who wash plastic dishes. Do you really love Michel? Why do you ask? I don't know, no reason. He's so very touching. It's true. Look at them. They're gagging for it. Our very own johns. Madame du Barry took in a Bengali orphan boy to replace her recently deceased monkey. She called him Zamor. She had him baptized and taught him to read. She took him everywhere. And? When the Revolution began, Citizen Zamor went to Public Safety. He testified against his mistress and followed her cart to the guillotine. After that, du Barry's ch‰teau belonged to Mistinguett. She rented it out to the Dolly twins of music hall fame. They shared a lover. Rose, Mr. Pascal here. You never went to class. The social worker couldn't locate you. We've alerted the authorities. Call me. The police will arrest you. Call me urgently. Social Services called. I'm warning you, if the cops come, you're out of here. We'll all go to Balilme. No one can hurt you there. #NAME? I'm not afraid to be damaged. I'd just as soon party in their mansion till I die! You're freaking me out. It's done. I'm calling it a day. It's beautiful. More powerful than before. Your work has improved since you met her. And? You're too nice to her. You should treat her badly, you'll get more. You're not sleeping either? What do you want? You smell good. I smell like Michel. Like it? Very much. You should find him a gallery. A real one. He needs recognition. I'll think about it. Ok? I don't know. Why not? Gimme. For you! Gimme this too! Here! Thank you, Mademoiselle. This series you did of us is quite good. #NAME? #NAME? Good, right? You must keep at it. If it makes you happy. You don't seem to give a flying fuck. He's a snob. I love that. I don't give a damn! Let's fuck! Your turn. Look... Look! Greedy. Imagine if we never slept. Or better yet, never died. Immortality. How painful it must be. What a tragedy. Having to live forever. What an unbearable thought. Good thing death exists, after all. You're entirely right, my love. Death gets a bad rap. We could all die together. Good idea. Or get married all together. Good idea. Michel, I found you a gallery. Where? It belongs to my friend Mary Herrera, in New York. She's anxious to see your work. In New York? That's far. It'll be cold. I don't know. Five days without sleep is too much for me. I'm going to bed for a while. We'll have so much fun. We'll go to the Mudd Club. Lucille, wait for me! Are you sad? What's the point? Isn't this more chic? We're handling it better than they are. Lucille, my slippers! The archdeacon awaits us. He's particularly high today. I think he shot up in the taxi. Don't make me laugh. This is serious. Amen! So, by the powers vested in me, I now pronounce the four of you united by the sacred vows of marriage. Can I keep the miter? It's yours. Put it to good use. Uncle Babal used it for his black masses. Will you write a nice article about us? You bet. The first 4-way marriage! Beats Mao's widow and the Leftist Coalition for a scoop. We'll launch a new wedding magazine, We Four! No more silly romance rags. Hey, kids! You need to give me your passports. So I can reserve our plane tickets for New York. I have no passport. This'll be tricky. Don't you have a friend in government? True, I do. You're right. Think it'll be sunny in New York? Stop fidgeting. So? Hold my hand, I'm tired. No Michel, please. Leave us alone. Leave us alone. I want us to calm down. My nerves can't take it. I couldn't get you a passport. I love Michel and want him to succeed. I'll take good care of him. I don't get it. Don't make me say it again, it's hard enough. Please, don't say anything to Michel. Don't spoil everything. Room 113 the game of blind man's bluff the opium pipe They're beautiful. The guitar lesson Take them. These too. Rose... Calm down. Rose, please. I'm going for work. Don't do this to me, Rose. I'll hurry back. Please make an effort, for us. Come on. I love only you. No Michel, don't leave! You promised me. #NAME? #NAME? The Concorde won't wait. Stop crying, ok? Don't leave me! I'm going. Don't leave me, Michel! #NAME? #NAME? Short hair would suit you. Be a nice change. If you like, I'll take you to a hairdresser. Dunno. Come sit next to me. Stop waiting for Michel. He'll take his time. He's an artist. I'm not hungry. I'm going up to my room to read. Michel? Michel, where are you? It's Rose, pick up the phone. Why don't you call me? Hi. So, you didn't go to New York? That sucks. No, as you can see. I'd rather read. The Palace is horrid tonight, so empty. Wait. Can you sell these for me? I need money. - Where'd you get them? - They're Lucille's. You stole them? No, she gave them to me. Coming? We'll show them our love. Let's go home. C'mon, baby. She's staying with me. - Leave us the fuck alone! - Asshole! Yvan, calm down. Calm down... I'm going to Hubert's to wait for Michel. Know what, dude? You're a loser. The gray here is so dark... Is she gone? If it makes you happy, I'll find an acting class for you. Isn't that what you want? I feel the difference. #NAME? #NAME? Yeah, not being glued to Rose. I realize now what a burden that was. Because I'm responsible for her. Right. You want to move here? That'd be awesome. Know what? I'm not a homewrecker, believe it or not. I separated Hubert from his wife so he could write. It's what he wanted. But he has no talent. In the end, he did nothing. He's not like you. Penny for your thoughts. Tell me your secret, I told you mine. It's good here, for work. But if we move to New York, Rose should come too. Of course. Shall we dine at Lipp's afterwards? What do you do in your room all day? Whatever I want! #NAME? Right, nothing. #NAME? Nothing else matters. Wrong. I went out. But that's all you do. #NAME? Where'd you go? #NAME? #NAME? You spent money you don't have. You'll be hitting me up again. And you'll give me some. - I don't feel like working! - Don't say that. #NAME? Don't laugh. You're playing cop again. #NAME? You don't scare me. Just because I'm a woman doesn't mean I must work! Are you thick or what? You'll end up alone. I guarantee I'll split. What'll you do all alone? Don't worry about me. Good. We'll stop improvising and work on Marivaux. Why'd you come in? You promised to wait outside. - Rose! - Leave me alone! Rose! Open up! Open up, Rose! Rose... I love you. Rose, I love you. Open up, please. Go away! Lucky you don't love me. I'd destroy you! "In a word, I want him even-tempered. 25 And that's harder... 52 And that's harder to find than you might think." Wanna go to Rome with me? Don't wanna kiss me either? They left us high and dry. They keep staying 2 more days. Why do you always pout? C'mon, let's go to Rome! You and me! With what passport? I can get you a passport. I thought it was impossible. Let's just say... Lucille didn't try very hard. To be honest, she never went to see her contact. Did Michel know? Listen, Rose. The exhibition is very important for him. That's how it is with artists. Stop it! I'm sick to death of you! Goddammit! What is it? What a fucking nightmare! These drawings are awful, Lucille. I feel like my insides have been hollowed out. Stop clinging to me! I'm suffering! Stop constantly questioning yourself. Stop moaning. It's unbearable! Get up. It's true, you're right. Thank you. Be calm. I missed you. Me too. Why didn't you call? I did. You were never here. Hold me tight. Tighter. I did a portrait of Diana Ross. I've got a show in January at a top Soho gallery. My job is amazing. They want large formats. That's great. So you're happy? Of course. In 2 months you'll be 18. You'll come with us. We'll move to New York. The energy there is incredible. Michel, I'm not going. Why do you say that? Why do you say such things? I'm sick of this life. I've started drama school. I want to study under Antoine Vitez. We'll stay together, Rose. You'll take classes in New York. You wanted adventure. You go ahead. You do it. I don't understand. Trying to prevent my exhibition? Not at all, Michel. If you want, we'll stop everything. We'll go away, now. I'll leave her. You'd be dumb to leave Lucille. She can give you what I can't. I don't want to lose you. Coming downstairs? See the nice robe Lucille bought for me? It's from Bloomingdale's. She thought of me. Taking off? You're right to leave. Wanna go to Rome for real? I've got a friend there. He's a prince. He lives in a palace named after him, on a square named after him. He pretends to work in film, but all he does are teenage girls and opium. I'll keep my hands off you. I've made love with so many people. I'll introduce you to rich people. We'll go to beautiful places. Don't worry, Kitten. Lucille can't make a man happy. She's not a woman, she's a spell. My friend Francis Bacon pointed that out to me. He said... The day I die, she'll be right here. They borrow her. She always comes back. That... is the difference between love and despair. Desperate people come back together. Whereas those who are truly in love, the pure ones, can only lose one another. Don't hold me back, I'm gone. Do as you like, you're free. I don't know why you didn't leave sooner. I'm not coming back, Michel. Rose, don't leave me. Please don't insist. I'll do anything you want. Got a boyfriend? No, there's no boyfriend. I'm staying with Yvan. I love you. Only you exist. Michel, you have to let me go. Here's your costume for the dance. I enlarged the wings. What dance? Fabrice asked her to perform at the Palace tonight. I don't want to do it. Don't let me down. Vogue promised me a page and you're paid 500 francs. You were wonderful! You should work in music halls. They need lead dancers. You and Michel are finally over? What a shame. Such a pretty pair. I'll introduce you to Karl. He loved Rose's costume. Come to London with us. Let's dance. Stay with me, Rose. It's over. C'mon. Stop, Michel. Subtitles: Bad Kitty Subtitling: MŽdia Solution
