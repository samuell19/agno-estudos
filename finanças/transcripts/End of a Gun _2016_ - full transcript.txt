[woman 1] Hello, Decker. I'm at Chateau Nightclub, on 17... with some of my girl friends. Are you coming tonight? I can't wait to see you. Text me when you're out, bye. [woman 2] Decker, just seeing if you got my message about tonight. It would be great if you came, text me. [Decker] That's me, Michael Decker. Ex-pat, "ex" a lot of things, but none of them for the reasons you might think. In my life, nothing ever happens for the reasons you might think. [indistinct arguing] Hey. [arguing continues] [woman] You're hurting me! Get off of me! [Decker] Hey, what's going on here? - What was that for? - It was money for you! For me, it was my fucking money, so give me my fucking money. Don't buy jewelries with my money, girl! - Hey. - What? - Leave her alone. - What is it? - Get your hands off the lady-- - We're fine, man. We're good, okay? We're just having a little, fuck... How do you say, a little, disagreement. - Come with me. - No, no, no. I already told you, man. Alright? We're fine. We got no fucking problem. We don't need any fucking around, alright. This stupid bitch. The lady's coming with me. So you're a fucking American, is that-- [bone cracks] [man screams] [Decker] Come with me, I'll take you home. The fuck... come back here. Mother fuck-- [bone cracks] - [bone cracks] - [Decker] We're done here. [groans] [woman] He's got a gun! [groans] [police sirens] [man] Hey, what the hell happened to my car - That's my car! - [officer indistinct] [Officer] Just wait. We will take care of everything. The shooter's over there. He says he would only speak with you. Says he knows you. Girl over there is a witness, backs up his story. [speaks French] [continues in French] Look what the cat dragged in. Michael, - how are you doing? - Doing good. But I've been better. - How's Delphine? - Oh, you know how it is. We are getting older. But she keeps herself fit, can't complain. I think, uh, some folks are gonna want to look at this, now. [gun clicks] Didn't turn out very good but... Is that all you are carrying? That's it. By the way, you know, he did have a gun and he was shooting at me, and if I hadn't had that, I'd be dead now. Obviously, I can carry gun wherever the American flag flies, but I do have a special arrangement here once in a while, so... You didn't answer my question, Michael. What's your question? Are you carrying another piece? No. Okay. Let them conduct the investigation. Well, you know, please keep in mind, like I said, if I hadn't been armed, I'd be dead right now and there ain't nothing wrong with self defense, even in France. Michael... Yes. Still, believe me when I tell you that that shooting team over there Is going to watch long and hard at you, because of your past. But I was exonerated. That doesn't mean you didn't put the scumbag into a bag, does it? - No, it doesn't. - [laughs] [Jean] Well, come on, let's get some coffee down at the station, while [ fill out the paperwork. I'm going to need to ask you a few questions about last night. Mademoiselle, please. [Jean] Mark and initial any correction, and sign it. Why are you getting so motherfucking formal with me, man? I'm a fucking ghost over here, man. I don't exist. Michael, I didn't know you were working undercover here. Well, that would be the reason for being undercover is to not tell people you're undercover. Whatever, just sign the goddamn statement. Sun is coming up and I'm tired. What the girl said... I can't discuss that with you. [Decker] I just wanna know if she's backing up my story, you know, if she's sharing the same version that actually happened. Hmm, your version? Hey, man, no two people remember the same shit the same way. [Jean] I can't tell you what the other witness said. Look, man, I killed this guy tonight. All I want to find out is who he is. [sighs] "Cause I'm stuck here and I can't get to my people to find out nothin'. Michael, listen to me. How long have we been friends? Back when you was young, dumb, and full of cum, and had a fucking full head of hair, and you were about 50 pounds lighter. Funny. Long enough for me to know you got a bum wrap from the agency. I get it, I get it. American style, fuck the police. You know what? I would have feel the same way, too. Old school guys like you and I, are the only one left who still respect each other. So, read it and sign it. Let's go home. [Decker] Why in the world would I shoot some dumb-ass white bitch in the fucking parking lot, to blow my fucking cover and get me into all kinds of bullshit. You typed the motherfucker up, you sign it. And by the way, that's my favorite fucking gun y'all took. It's evidence. Since when do you give a fuck about the evidence? It's a justifiable shooting, man. It's procedure, Michael. I'm sorry. [scribbling] You took my favorite gun. Ronnie Martin, Ronnie Martin. Thirty-two years old, born in Houston, Texas. I already stole that shit off the reporter. I don't need you no more. Owns a nightclub. Owned, I guess I should say. [Decker] Yeah, you should. [Decker] That's trouble right there. In my life, trouble always comes in a small black dress and legs for days. Always. - Long night, huh? - Yeah. But, then again, it's a new day. Sorry about your boyfriend. You seem completely torn up about that. Well, we were only together for a short time. I see. We met at the club where I used to dance. He made me quit dancing and ended up buying the club. Hey, can we smoke out here? It's France, man. You can smoke, like, in the Louvre. You can smoke anywhere here. Hmm. Thanks. [waitress speaks French] Ronnie had money, too. A lot of money. A lot of money, lot of money. Where do you think he got all that money? Lieutenant said you used to be a cop back in the States. Something like that. Well, then, I shouldn't have to spell it out for you. Yeah, but you see, folks can make a lot of money a lot of different ways. They can make money pimping hos, they can make money Killing people. They can-- He sold crystal meth. Or at least worked for the people that did. Ah-ha. And, um... during his hard schedule of selling drugs, he also beat you up, didn't he? Only when I was bad. Why'd you stay with him? He kept me from being bad. [chuckles] So what do you think you're gonna do now? I wanna get his car and go home, but the police won't let me have it. And that's why you're here, because you need a relative like a wife or someone, right? Could you get it for me? What are you talking about? His car. I have a spare set of keys. What if I give you something? I'll probably pass on that at the moment. Ronnie had a lot of money stashed away. How much is there? Two million. Mm-hmm. I'll give you ten percent. Technically, it's not stealing. Ten percent of two million that's in his car. That's not stealing. - It's kind of stealing. - But they're bad people, and they don't deserve to get it back. What do you think's gonna happen if we don't steal it? I think it'll go back to Ronnie's bitches and they'll put the drugs on the street, which means it's better if we steal it, because at least less people will be hurt. Precisely. Let me ask you something. You sure the money's there? He liked to brag. Thought it got me hot. It did. Do you have any idea what he did with the money? Once a month, he'd drop a bunch of it off at the bank. - Do you know what bank? - I don't know. I'd go shopping while he did it. Do you know who's money it was. Who cares? Some cowboy that lives in Houston, Texas. They call him Mr. Vargas. - Mm-hmm. - [woman] They're bad people. They don't deserve to get it back. If we take it, we'd be doing society a favor, and you would be doing your job. [man] Yeah, boss. He's not saying anything. I'm working on him all day. [man grunting] [cell phone ringing] - Where is he? - Inside. Hi, Mom. Yes, I know about your doctor's appointment. You reminded me yesterday. Two o'clock, right? I'll be there at 1:30. [man grunting] That will give us plenty of time. Yes, Mom. I know you like to be there on time. Mom, listen... Alright, I'll be there at one o'clock, okay? Good. No, I won't be late. Bye, Mom. I said bye, Mom. [man groans] Hey, hey, Trevor. Trevor... Hey, wake up, man. Wake up, man. Someone wants to talk to you. Trevor. Mr. Vargas wants you to give back what you took from him. I swear to God, Gage, I didn't take anything. [man grunts] Hey, hey, Trevor. Trevor, hey. - Wake up, man. Wake up, man. - [cell phone ringing] Excuse me. Hello, Mr. Vargas. [Vargas] Ronnie is dead. How? Got into a fight with that girlfriend slut of his from the club [Gage] Lisa killed him? No, he got himself shot. [groans] We all know you took the money, Trevor. What happened to the money? Technically, it's not stealing. Ten percent of two million that's in his car. - Precisely. - [Vargas] I don't know. Neither does the lawyer. That's why I need you there. Okay, I'm talking to Trevor. [Vargas] I don't give a shit about Trevor. I want you to find the fucking money. [Gage sighs] [man] Shh! What do you want? We're friends, yeah? [Trevor] I would never take anything from Mr. Vargas. I'd slit my own throat first. You won't have to slit your own throat. Gage, please, I didn't do it. I swear. [Trevor gasps] [choking] Give me that. Clean this up. Hey... what was that about? Another problem. Oh, yeah? - Listen, uh, I gotta ask you a favor. - Sure. My mother has a doctor's appointment at two o' clock. - I'm supposed to take her. - No problem. Make sure you get there early. She can't stand to be late. And, uh, tell her I'll call her tonight. Sure thing, boss. - What? - Nothing. What? - You think he did it? - [chuckles] No. So why'd you uh... [snickers] - It's my job. - Yeah. In this business, you're either the guy hanging somebody from the ceiling, or you're the guy hanging from the ceiling. [speaking French] - Nice ride. - Thank you, baby. - On a cop's pension. - What pension? [chuckles] - So where are we going? - Back to my apartment. Wait, I thought you said we were gonna go get the money. Money's in the car, and the car's in the impound lot, right? You don't have a plan, do you? Yeah, my plan is to go get the money. You're gonna stroll into the impound lot and take the money? - Yeah, I am. - Yeah, I'd like to see that. You're about to. You're about to. [woman speaks French] Why don't we stay in my office? [children playing] We're good here. I knew you were in town, but I didn't know you were coming here. Surprise. Ah, well. I'm to understand Mr. Vargas is concerned about... - [dog growling, whimpers] - Hey, that's my dog! I understand Mr. Vargas is concerned about-- He wants his money back. I tried to do everything I can to understand what happened after all these things. The only thing that matters to Mr. Vargas is results. Trying... will just get you killed. - I've got some preliminary-- - Where's Ronnie's car? The police have it. I believe at the impound lot. You believe? You believe or you're sure? I'm sure. Did they find the money? I believe-- No, no, they have not. When can we have the car back? I spoke to the man who oversees-- - When? - Tomorrow. Why not today? 'Cause the captain leaves at five. He can't be the only one who can release a car. To next of kin. He wants to see a power of attorney, signed by Mr. Martin's wife, authorizing-- Tell him I'm Ronnie's brother. Unless you have a driver's license in the name of Martin, I'm afraid we'll have to wait. Then I wanna know everything there is to know about the man who shot Ronnie. They haven't released his name. - But they will. - Of course. But I believe not until morning. [sighs] You have two hours. [stutters] Two hours, it's... By the way, you just stepped in dog shit. Surprise. [Lisa] Okay, so what's this plan of yours? First, I need you to tell me exactly where the money is. [Lisa] It's in a black 2013 Jaguar XF. - It has to be guarded. - [Decker] Oh, it is guarded, darlin'. It's guarded. [Lisa] The money's in the trunk, underneath a bunch of junk. It's all there. Two million, cash. I hope you're right. Is that a real badge? Sho' enough it is. Listen, I spent a long time in the military, and a long time in law enforcement. I can make this happen. I really can, if you listen to me. I've got a plan. You gotta do everything I say. If you go off the res, you will fuck shit up and get us caught or killed, alright? Even if this shit looks like it's going sideways, it ain't, I promise you. - Can you do that? -Yes. [Decker] All right. Now, there's gonna be one cop in the office. He'll have a manifest for all the impounds as well as the keys. [Lisa] But I told you, I have a set of keys. [Decker] And that's why he ain't never gonna see me. [chuckles] I got the guy's name. Michael Decker. 8965 Rue Monge. Apartment 74. [Gage] That was fast. - [lawyer] Wait, there's some more. - More? - He's an American, used to be a federal agent. Can you believe it, DEA? Shit, that's not good. [lawyer] Used to be, because he was forced to retire without benefits. I don't need to hear his life story, man. Without benefits means no pension. [Gage] So they guy needs money? [lawyer] A lot of accommodations and a lot of dead drug dealers. The guy is dangerous. [Lisa] Okay, what do we do now? We wait. We wait? That's the plan? - You know why? - Why? Because it's about to get dark, and you understand something, sweetheart? Darkness is our friend. [chuckles] [Decker] Oh, yeah, darkness is our friend. [Lisa] Ronnie had money, too. A lot of money. I wanna get his car and go home, but the police won't let me have it. Could you get it for me? [Decker] I'll probably pass on that at the moment. What if I give you something? [door opens] What time is it? Why, I'd say it's time for me to tell you that I'm in. Wow. I must have been good. You were really, really good, but I'd like to be partners. For half. - Half? - Yeah. - I'm not that good. - Really, really good. [Decker] That okay? - Okay. - All right. [Lisa] You weren't so bad yourself, Decker. So, when are you going back? Well, the... graveyard guy comes in like, about 10:30, so I'll go in around 11 or so, give him time to get to sleep. You're funny. You know what, you're not gonna be able to go back after this, don't forget that. Yeah, you already said, but what about my apartment, all of my stuff? Million dollar buy a lot of shit, baby. What about you? I'm gonna have to disappear, you know. Before the police start coming look for me saying, "Man, you know, I think the guy who shot Ronnie is the same motherfucker that broke into this car and stole all the money." [chuckles] If you say so. So where are you gonna disappear to? I got a friend, lives down in Key West. He's trying to set me up down there. - Maybe it's time to go home. - Florida? I've never been to the States. Maybe I can come with you. Come on. Pretty please? I promise I'll behave. Unless you don't want me to... behave. Let me think about that. Why won't you take me with you? I mean, I just don't know why you'd wanna come. I'll just wait in the car. Because you'll wanna help, right? Is that it? Yes, I want to help. I'll probably be a lot better off without you. You know... And, uh, waiting in the car, I don't think it's gonna help anybody. I think you wanna do it just to keep an eye on me, is that right? It's not that. It's just... [Decker] Then why? - It's because it's my-- - It's your money? - My idea. - Your idea? Well, that is true, but, you know, - I'm taking a little bit of risk here. - Not if I come with you. I just think you're gonna be in the way. And what am I supposed to do until then? Bake cookies? I love the fuck out of cookies. [chuckles] Come on! I'll be your lookout. I'll bake you cookies when we get back. Naked. I guess you don't trust me to come back? No, I trust you. It's just, I wanna be there. If I wait here, I'll go crazy. Remember, I have a plan. [Decker] Believe it or not. Go pack your shit, "cause we can't come back here. [laughs] Hop in. Do you have any idea how hard it was to find you? You still have a connection at the phone company? Yeah, sure. I want to find out where Ronnie's girlfriend is. - Why? - Got a bad feeling. [Decker] Alright, listen. You're the lookout. You keep the windows cracked so you can listen for any trouble. Don't play the radio. Don't talk on your cell phone. That way you can hear if someone is coming. You're expecting someone to sneak up on me? Nah, man, I just need you to keep your eyes and ears open. You're here to help me. [scoffs] It's pitch dark outside. That's our friend. Remember what I told you, the night is our friend. Well, what do I do if a cop drives up? Just flirt with him, man. Offer to bake him some cookies or something. [car door beeping] [woman speaks French on TV] [man speaking French on TV] [woman speaks French on TV] Hey, man, what are you doing here? Me? What are you doing here, huh? [guard groans] [car beeps] [guard groans] [woman speaking French on TV] [gun fires] [engine starts] [gun fires] [Lisa] So, did you get it? All of it. Yeah, now you owe me some good pussy. [laughs] [Decker] Can't go back to my place so we're gonna lay up here for the night. [Lisa] Here? It's not a five star, is it? [Decker] Here? Not even close, come on. [door shuts] So now what? We hang around in this room, and lay low for a minute. [groans] I should have kept my room at Hotel Jolie. You should have. But, you came with a bad man like me. [laughs] [Lisa] So, when can we get out of here? I'm just in the middle of making some arrangements. What time is it? Time for you to see if you could close those blinds for me, please. Yeah. [Decker] Trouble always starts when you get your hands on the money. Like I said earlier; no two people see the same event the same way. I promise you that. [laughs] We're rich. - What do you need? - We're here for a car. - Let me guess, a black Jag? -Yes. An asshole snuck in last night and broke into it. He beat the hell out of couple of guards. Hey, hey, hey, hey! What the hell is his problem, huh? This is a release signed by Captain Dardou this morning. I don't care, the car is evidence now. This was signed an hour ago. Unless the break in you mentioned was more recent than that. This authorization supersedes any need you have of the vehicle as evidence. Who the hell are you? [chains rattle] Motherfucker. Who do you think? Lisa. Ronnie's girlfriend? She's the only one who knew. - And Decker? - Definitely. But he's not an agent anymore. [sighs] I'll be right back. Can you bring me back some breakfast? I can. Are you taking the money? [Decker] Just a little bit. It would be safer here. It's safe with you and even safer with me, 'cause I got the gun. - You don't trust me? - I do. [Decker] Trust isn't an all or nothing proposition. It takes time to grow. We got a decent start, but we've only known each other for about 30 hours. - So you don't trust me. - I do trust you. Why don't you stay? You don't have to go. I will be right back, and here's the thing; I've got a plan. It's an unusual plan, but I got your back. You'll see. You'll see what I got. He's here, boss. Antoine, Plummer. What's with the hat? Mr. Vargas said you need help, going up against some American. Yes, I do. [speaks French] [Luc] Who's this fool? He's my cousin, Pee Wee. [chuckles] - No shit? - Really. - Yep. - [Gage] Alright. Come on, get in. Hey, stupid, lose the hat. [Luc] Well, this is the address Chauvin gave us: Michael Decker. Lose the fucking hat. [lock clicks] Check the bathroom. [cell phone rings] What do you got for me? Great, thanks. Tell me. It was my guy from the phone company. That bitch used her cell phone 20 minutes ago. - Where? - Chef Monteur at Rue Galmain. Google shows a little fleabag hotel out... out that way. Wait for me. [cell phone rings] [speaks French] Hey, I need two tickets out of here tomorrow morning. If my plan comes together. Of course, what's going on? I don't know, man. Key West sounds good and warm, doesn't it? So you need an exit route. [Decker] Well, I'll call you back within 24 hours to confirm. [speaks French] I miss you, too, brother. [chuckling] [rings bell continuously] Bonjour. I'm looking for a man and a woman. He looks like a cop, she looks like a stripper. Sorry, but I cannot help you with that. - See that wall behind you? - Oui. It will be splattered with your fucking brains if the next words out of your mouth aren't a room number. Three-seventy-two, third floor. Third, trots. Hey! Put that down. - Put it down. - [receiver clicks] They don't have enough cops in this city to stop me from killing you. Okay. I'll knock. Luc, cover me. And you keep that thing put away until we get inside. Yeah, but what if he moves on me. Let me and Luc worry about that. You just shut the door behind us - and keep your eyes open, okay? - Okay. Okay. [knocks] [Lisa] Got my breakfast? [gasps] Shh, shh, shh, shh. Check the bathroom. Pull that shut. Where's the money? I don't know what you're talking about. [Gage] Okay. I'll ask you again. Only this time, if I don't get an answer, this gun will be the last fucking thing you will ever have the pleasure of wrapping your luscious lips around, hmm? Where's the money? [cell phone rings] Is that him calling? I don't know. You don't know. See what number it is. They hung up. [Luc] Give it here. [gasps] Let me see? Yeah. That was him. Where is he now? How am I supposed to know? [Decker] Merci. - [waitress] Bonjour. - I'll have a juice. [Luc] Boss, found it. Holy shit! - [laughs] - Move away. Where's the rest of the money? I don't know. Keep looking. Where's Decker? [Lisa] I don't know. You are starting to bore the hell out of me, Lisa. [groans] [grunts] [groans] [bones crack] [groans] [gun cocks] [yells] [tires squeal] [gun fires] [crowd screams] Get out of the car. Take the bag. [sighs] What's going on? Where's Pee Wee? Dead, same as Luc. - What do you mean, dead? - I mean dead. - Like he ain't breathing. - What the fuck? Exactly, he fucked up, and he got himself fucking killed. - What the-- - [gun cocks] Here's 30,000. Take it. Bury your fucking Pee Wee and keep what's left. He was not my favorite cousin, you know. Get the girl. [telephone rings] [Vargas] Gage, do you know what time it is here? Sorry sir. It's just that-- [Vargas] / said, do you know what time it is here? It's late, sir. Yes, late, Gage, which means this better be good. I've located your money, sir. [Vargas] Good start. A better start would be to say you have my money, Gage. - That would be better. - I have half of it. I'm about to get the other half. [Vargas] Then I would say this very late phone call is very premature, wouldn't you say? [Gage] I'm not calling you about the status of your money, Mr. Vargas. [Vargas] Then why the fuck are you calling, Gage? "Cause I want to tell you that the man who has the other half is a former DEA agent from Texas. Michael Decker. Does the name ring a bell? - Gage? - Yes, sir. [Vargas] Get my money from this Michael Decker. I don't expect to speak to you again until this entire unfortunate incident has been resolved. One way or another. Where's the rest of the money? He took it with him. - Where? - I don't know. [gasps] I don't like killing women, but I'll do it if I have to. He's going to Key West. [Gage] Key West? Key West is a little far from Paris. What if I can get him to come back? How? I'll call him. Why would he answer your call? Why do you think? He took half the money with him. He didn't trust me to hold it. Smart man. [Lisa] / was going with him to Key West. I figured somewhere along the way, I could get the rest of the money and ditch him. [Gage] You wanted it all, huh? - Not for me, for Mr. Vargas. - Mr. Vargas? You went to all this trouble for Mr. Vargas. I went to all this trouble to get him off my back. I promised Decker ten percent, and a great piece of ass if he helped me. Ten percent? I don't think he did it for the money, if you know what I mean. He stole money from us, and then he stole half of it again from you. I think you got it wrong. You'll never understand this, Gage, but Decker could have taken it all. He didn't. He's a decent guy. I'll tell him you're gonna kill me if he doesn't bring back the money. Make the call. [door bell rings] Michael. Well, you better come inside. Jean is waiting for you. [cell phone rings] [Decker] Decker, leave a message. Michael, it's Lisa. Look, you're a decent man. I know you are and I'm begging you to please help me. They want the money back, not us. Everything can go back to the way it was. We can still go to Key West, just like we planned. If they don't get the money back, Michael, they're gonna kill me. [whimpers] Please, help me. Convincing? This Mr. Vargas is an evil man, Michael. Hiding with the Sinaloa Cartel, not much of a footprint here, you know, but most definitely on the radar of some of your former friends in the DEA back home. [Jean] Probably the FBI, as well. He's one of the bad guys. Well, we love to get rid of the bad guys. We really do. I don't give a fuck what happens to the bad guys. [chuckles] Michael... you remember this? I sho' enough do. [Decker] How could I forget? [sighs] It would have been a lot worse had you not taken the second bullet for me. I owe you my life. It ain't nothing, man, really. - We're even. - No, no, no, mon ami. [speaks French] I get to say when we're even, not you. That's the way it works. [Lisa] Michael, it's Lisa. Look, you're a decent man, I know you are, and I'm begging you to please, help me. They want the money back, not us. - Everything could-- - [phone beeps] You think he'll show? What? Sure. Won't he suspect a trap? Of course he will. What about me? What about you? We have a deal, right? Yeah, we have a deal. [Decker] See when you're forced to trust your partner in crime, in my experience, is when things usually start to go bad. Call it human nature or some shit. [Lisa] You ever think about running away? [Gage] You mean, like, uh, to Key West? I hear Argentina's nice. [cell phone rings] - Is it him? - Yep. Shouldn't I answer it? - Hello, asshole. - [Decker] She all right? For now. [Decker] Let me talk to her. Not until I have all the money. Y'all realize I don't know this girl much at all. [Gage] You have a million euros, you can always run. [Decker] That's not what I do. - I want the rest of the money. - [Decker] I want the girl. - How do we do this? - I think I'll come and get her. [Gage] Clichy-sous-bois two-seven-four avenue. I know where you are. So Michael, remember, the bag without the tape has the money. The one with the tape goes boom. Right, what's the blast radius? Twenty feet, beyond that, I'll still duck. Here. I figure you're probably going to need your favorite gun for this one, n'est pas? - Thanks, what about you? - Moi? I have this. [speaks French] Where are you two guys going? Well, like I said. I'm just taking him out for a little lunch. - For lunch, huh? - Yeah. [Delphine] It was really great to see you. [Decker] Nice to see you. [Delphine] Make sure he comes home safe. I will. [speaks French] [Jean] How far is it? [Decker] About two blocks. Where you gonna set up? Somewhere they won't see me. C'est bon. [sings in French] [Plummer] Boss wants to speak to you. - I'd like to speak to him. - I'm gonna need your gun. Yeah, well, we all got weapons around here. Unless we're gonna throw 'em all in a big pile, we're gonna have to live with this here. [dialogue muted] [Plummer] Boss man wants you to step out of the car. - I said, get the fuck out of the car. - [gun cocks] I said back up or next time I'm gonna fucking shoot you. One. [laughs] Deux. Come on, ladies, always one more. Ah, there you are. Merci beaucoup, mon ami. Do I know you? I doubt it. I don't know, man. You, uh... you look familiar. Maybe I got one of those faces. Yeah, maybe. Why don't you put your piece down. You know, like I told your girl, man, everybody got guns around here, man. That's the way it is. You're surrounded. Well, it may seem like that to you, but it might could be an illusion. [laughs] I will say this for you, man. You've got balls. [Decker] Well, thank you for noticing that. My girl, here, she knows that for a fact. [chuckles] - Did you bring the money? - I did. Don't open it. Put it down. Open it. Give it to me. - Feels light. - Well, that's kind of normal. It feels light because... I need my girl. [Decker] Send me the girl. Get down. [Jean] Oh, no, you don't. [Decker] Get down. [gunshots] [guard] Gage! [groans] [Decker] Stay down. [groaning] Lisa, get this. [gunshots] Get down! [groans] [Jean] Decker! [groans] Okay, you son of a bitch. [groans] [moans] Turn around, drop the bag, and kick it to me. [chuckling] Why'd you come back? You could have walked away with a million in cash. I'm not all about the money, I'm all about the honor. You're an honorable man. I respect that. But in this business, you're either the guy hanging somebody from the ceiling-- Or the guy hanging from the ceiling. You know... I used to hear that back at headquarters once in a while, which reminds me, now that we've had all the shit out the bag, I do remember you, you were Danny's CI. You were Danny's high level CI. Ain't that right? Piece of advice. The dark side, doesn't suit you. I agree with you. Sounds like we both used to work for assholes. That's for sure. Rest of the money's in the trunk. My end was five percent, I've already taken that out. And you're giving me the rest. [grunts] - Thanks. - You all right? Yeah, it's bad enough, but if I get to a hospital I think I'll live. Long night, huh? - Yeah. - Give me the money. I gather Key West is off the table. That money's mine, and there's not enough to share. Not with you, or anyone else. I, uh, risked my life for you. Just on the odd chance you might see there's somebody out there who's not bad, who's not crooked, who's straight up. I don't really care about money. I care about honor, and no matter how this goes, at least I showed you that. The real treasure in life are people who love you, who are willing to die for you. See you in the next life. [gun fires] I'm really sorry it turned out like this. I really am. You know what... friend of mine used to say? Never trust a stripper. The only thing she really wants to see coming out of your pants IS your money. You smart mouthed motherfucker, you. Can we go now? I really think I need to see a doctor. [chuckles] I finally get to take a bullet for you. You're a funny motherfucker, too, hey? How you holding up? I'll make it, just roll me to the ER. I'll have them call Delphine and I'll tell her, I get drunk and robbed. - You're an asshole. - [Jean laughs] Well, I'll make sure you're taken care of. Don't be an idiot. You need to be gone and stay gone. Key West, remember? I already got you the ticket. Did you stash the rest of that money back to my place? I did, it's in a garbage can outside the back door. Mmm, how much? Five hundred thou. Oui. Now we're even, mon ami. [laughing] [speaking French] [hums] [Decker] So once again, the real treasures in life are all about the people who love you, that are willing to take a bullet for you. If it's all about the money, you're bound to find yourself at the end of a gun. [phone ringing] [Decker] Decker. [woman laughs] Decker, Decker, Decker! Where have you been? I've been calling you for the last couple of days and nothing? We're back at Chateau tonight. Are you coming? [dialogue muted over credits]
