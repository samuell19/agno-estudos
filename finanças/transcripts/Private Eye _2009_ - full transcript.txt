PRIVATE EYE Let me see! Now! Yes! Yes! I'll kill them both! Here we go. Keep your clothes off. One... Two... Mrs. Kim of Jungdong was caught in bed with another man. On August 1. This is just cheap gossip. We'll run it in the back pages. Fine, but people seem to read their papers back to front. They go for the back pages first. I wonder why. I never said I won't take it. I need to get paid first. That'll be 5 won, with the article. Fine. Do you have enough for the trip? N America Cruise Liner Freddy Setting Sail in 14 Days 500 won, is it? This ship is leaving in 2 weeks. Why do you want to go to the States anyway? To get rich. There are tons more people there, which means tons more cheating wives! Bye. He can go to China for that. Byul, are you hungry? No. Where are we going? We have to put up some more. Let's go. What do you want? What did they put up? Royal Circus. There's no need for this. There. Scissors! Scissors! Forceps! Hurry! Ethyl! Yes, sir! Idiot! I'm sorry! His pulse is too high! Find the artery! How is he? His pulse is returning to normal. Good. Close his brachial artery. You were amazing, sir. It was an honor. You were great. Has the patient paid his bill? Well... Look. No! We need the cow! These Koreans never pay in cash. I need to go back to Japan. You. Sir. You seem to know your way around the human body. I've been studying dead animals. You need to study an actual human body. You will be my right arm from now on. What? But, sir! Quiet. Thank you, sir. 200... 1... 2... 3... I sent over two kids, so don't worry. We have to get there before Mr. Min does. Hurry up! Will you hurry? What are you doing? You told us to clean up in here. Why is there still blood? Huh? Do you want the old man to see his own son's blood? Look at this mess. Is it really unlucky to step on a dead man's blood? 2... 4... 6... 8... This is awful. Soo-hyun! My boy... Sir! Master! Sir! How could you let this happen? I am the Interior Minister, and my son was killed in his own house! I am deeply sorry, sir. Get out! Find my boy! Search all of Korea! Find him! Yes, sir. Right away. I wouldn't have gotten this job if it wasn't for Soo-hyun. Oh Young-dal, was it? Yes. It stands for "light" and "knowledge." I'll remember that name. Your name will be known throughout the land if you can find my boy. Here's a list of our suspects. Let's see. Ke-tong. Mak-dong. Pil-nam. Bum-gu. Bum-gu. That could stand for "tiger" and "dog." There's bound to be trouble if both animals are in one name. What does he do? He was the first one at the scene and called it in. My son had just come back from studying abroad. He could have ruled an empire. He's never done any harm, and he's never hurt anyone. I don't know why this happened. I hope he's still alive. Don't worry, sir. I'm sure he's fine. Soo-hyun... Where are you... Soo-hyun... What are you doing? I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Why did I bring this stupid body? Oh! I wonder who had the guts to kill Soo-hyun. The Minister is going to kill whoever did that to his boy. We should quit our jobs and go after the cash prize. Min Soo-hyun 500 Won Reward if Found "Someone owe money? Wife run away?" "Hong Jin-ho is your man. He can track down anyone." Enough. I know what I wrote, Doc. I could tell you're a doctor. I smell the alcohol on you. Let's see. I'll need 10 won up front and 10 won at the end. I'll also need 1 won everyday. You can expect to find the person within 10 days, so it won't cost you over 30. Who is it you want found? Oh. I'm looking for a murderer. Who? I said I'm looking for a murderer. Sir! I don't look for killers! That's what the police are for! Good day! Sir. I can't go to the police. My rule is, never do anything dangerous. Sir! It's just not worth it. Sir! Oh! You can track down anyone if you put your mind to it. Sir. You have to help me. This is all I have right now. You expect me to find a killer for just 5 won? This is just for hearing me out. You can decide when I'm done. Sir... So the body you found belongs to the Interior Minister's son? Yes. I was never here. You can't leave! No! I won't tell anyone about this. I have to go. Wait! I have to go! 500! I'll give you 500 won! Did you just say 500? I don't have the money now, but I'll get it once we catch the killer. So you'll pay me with the reward money? Why can't you just go to Mr. Min? Tell him you found the body, and he'll give you 500 won. Good luck. Wait! Please. This is why I can't go to the police. I already took out his heart and liver. I can't go to the cops. They'll think I killed him, too. You're in big trouble. Why did you take the body in the first place? You can do whatever you want. I don't care. Sir! It's 500 won. Are you just going to give that up? We have the body and we know where it was dumped. You'll find the killer in no time. All I want is to clear my name. I don't even want the reward. Fine. I'll find someone else. Over there. He was lying like this, on his side. There's no blood on the scene. The body must have been brought here. Doc. I see tracks. The killer must have brought a one-wheeled cart. Actually, that was me. You came well prepared. I know. Is there anything I can do? You covered the scene with these tracks. You've done enough. Are you sure it wasn't you? No. I already told you. Sir. Don't you think it's strange? Why would the killer leave the body out in the open? That forest is full of woodcutters. Either he's an idiot or he didn't want to hide the body. I feel like someone's watching me. That guy's been following us from the woods. Oh. Hey! Damn! Get him! Hey! No! What was I supposed to do? That sly bastard! Sorry. Why can't he stick to the road? Sir! Hop in! Hey! Go! Out of the way! Do you think he's the killer? If he is, we'll see him again. For now, let's call it a day. Ma'am. I brought the paper. Prayer Meeting at Bakdal Church 6:00 Ge-tong. We're going out. Welcome. Long time no see, ma'am. What's this? It's a telescope. It's huge. There are bigger ones in the West. I wanted to see the stars, so I gave it a go. It's not finished yet, so you can't see anything. Why did you ask to see me? Oh. It's completely broken. You seem different today. Can you tell? I've been asked to solve a murder. I'll get 500 won for it. A murder? Sounds interesting. Will you be going on the Freddy this time? I might. I wish I can live a life of adventure, too. Why don't you go to America? With you? That's not what I meant. You can study all you want there. I don't think that's possible. I'm taking enough risks as it is. She's waiting for you, sir. You must think I'm sick. Sir? It doesn't matter. I have everything I can possibly want, except youth. This may look sick, but I have to have it. I don't know what you're talking about, sir. I know you do. When will I meet Governor Murata? You'll hear from him soon. I see. I'll never forget your kindness. Stop! How will we find Soo-hyun if you clean up the crime scene? The missus told me to clean it up. How dare you talk back to an officer? I'll take it from here. Go outside! Now! There's blood everywhere. What is this? Where is everybody? Who are you? Who? Me? What's going on here? This is our case. Where are you from? Is this what Oh Young-dal taught you? Do you know him? We went to military school together. Officer Oh is right outside. Sir! I'll go talk to him myself. You clean up in here. I'm sorry, sir! Enough. I hear you're busy chasing after cheating wives. You should be ashamed. You used to be an officer. It must be easy work going after cheating women. I'll help you find your wife if she runs away later. Or has she already? It's embarrassing for a grown man to track down cheating wives. You need to man up. He's got nothing. You must be after the reward, but you're too late. We got the guy. You? You got the guy? Why is that funny? Do you want to see him? Who is he? He's Bum-gu, as in "tiger" and "dog." He was Soo-hyun's servant. He looks like a killer. What about the body? Where is the body? I was about to ask him. He's been in a daze all day. Hey! Where'd you put the body? Master Soo-hyun... Stop that! Where is the body!? - Sir. I checked his name. - And? Bum does stand for "tiger," but gu stands for "mouth.," not "dog." Are you sure? That's what his records say. That's not important! I'm the reason he died... Soo-hyun... Hey! I told you to stop that! Hey! Where is the body? Where? You're worse than he is! Hail Japan! You! I can put some iodine on that. You should have been more careful. Doc. I didn't get caught. What are you doing? Where'd it go? Here it is. What is that? It's important. You might know what it is. Ew! This is great! Don't you want any? I'm good. This soup is amazing. Sir. This is morphine. It's made from dried opium, so it's a really strong drug. Is it really morphine? Yes. Even doctors have to be careful with it. I wonder what it was doing in his room. Ever heard of the Opium House? No. We have to check it out. We have to find out what Soo-hyun was up to. What do you want? We came for the nirvana needle. Nirvana! I need the needle! Who told you? Bong-tae. Bong-tae! Go on. So, Bong-tae told you about this place? Yes. Bong-tae's been dead 3 months. Who are you? You must think we're idiots. I saw Bong-tae just yesterday. He was squeezing out pus under the bridge. If you say so. Bong-tae? Do you know these guys? Never seen them. Doc? Are you good at fights? No way. This kid isn't a user. I know that much. Fine! Bring it on! Sir? Are you okay? Let me see you. Don't touch me. Not another one! Jerk! My Far Seeing Eye! Your what? Raise it. Soo-hyun can't go a day without morphine. He was last here 4 days ago. What else? What more do you want? Wait! No! That's worth a lot of money! He had a mole on his neck. That's not what I want! Lower it. Okay. Fine! I'll talk! Raise it. Again? Bastards! Well? He usually comes at sunset and takes a rickshaw home to Jongno, but on that day, he went to Dokripmun. He spoke Japanese. Where did he go? He asked the rickshaw driver to take him to Dokripmun. There's nothing here. Who is it? Sir. It's me. What do you want? I'm busy. I want a word with you. I said I'm busy. Why? He's naked. What's wrong? It's the Commissioner. Commissioner! Stop them! This man isn't the Police Commissioner! The Commissioner is in his house! Do you know where the body of the Commissioner was found? No... It must be the same killer. First it's Min Soo-hyun... Now it's the Commissioner... Why is this getting so big? We'll just have to find the killer. That's all. Good meal. Is this article true? Is my son dead, like the Commissioner? These newspapers print whatever they want. We don't know anything for sure yet. How can you say that? It's been days! I'm so sorry, but if you can give us more time... Quiet! I'll have you fired and living off the streets! Sir. Just give us 3 days. Hurry! Why did you ask to see me? Why do you think? I don't know. You don't know? Didn't you hear? Soo-hyun and the Commissioner are dead. I introduced them to you, and they're dead. Are they really dead? All of Seoul knows, and yet you don't? I heard Soo-hyun was missing. Are you suspecting me? Think about it. They're both men I introduced to you. You've introduced me to a lot more people. What can I possibly gain from this? Do you think I'm stupid? I never said you killed them. Don't get all worked up. I'm sure it's a coincidence. They both had many enemies. Perhaps. I've already got my hands full with Soo-hyun's case. Uk-kwan. Why do you go downstairs to the basement everyday? I've been using dead animals for study. You're working hard. How would you like to see a real human body? Hey. Yes? You need to work fast on this. Right. What did you get yourself into? The weapon must have been a double-edged knife. Weapon? Did he say something about a weapon? What's going on? Sorry. What about a weapon? What? Oh... Yeah? He said a weapon was used. Uh... That's obvious. The stab wound on his leg is about 4 cm long. Sir, the Commissioner's wife sent over food. Idiot! You can't just come in here. Sorry. Was his mouth always like that? Sir! I took a look at the Commissioner's body! I know about the weapon! Double-edged knife. About 24 cm long? How did you know that? Take a look at this. This was inside his mouth. It could be a clue. Give me a high five. Good. This is what they do in America. Sir, who is she anyway? She looks like a lady. Will you keep it down? I was just curious. I call it the Secret Listener. It's modeled after a stethoscope. It lets you listen to conversations in the next room. Use this when you're in trouble. It's for you. It's pepper spray. It'll sting for a while. It's a flower. Not many men wear clothes with a flower pattern. Perhaps it's someone from the circus. Circus? They moved here from Dokripmun 2 days ago. Whoa... Look! They're real! It's no use! He's my younger brother. He doesn't get scared anymore, and that takes the fun out of this. It'd be a lot more fun to have a volunteer from the audience. Who wants to step up? Anyone? I'll do it! Korea still has one brave soul. What are you doing? Come on up. Welcome. Now. Hold still. I might make a mistake. I've hurt my own brother. This is getting out of hand. Well? Are you shaking yet? Are you trembling with fear? It gets worse. Wait! Wait a minute! I didn't know you'd be blindfolded! I didn't think I'd have to give up my life. Why? Are you scared? I didn't take you for a coward. Fine. You can go, if you want. Just leave your balls behind. If that's the deal... Fine. I'll take your knife. Don't blame me if I miss. You should pray. Wow! He did it! I hear cheers. You must still be alive. Yes. You are the best knifeman in all of Korea. Wow! That was great! Why did you go up there? I had my reasons. It's a perfect fit! Thank you! I should go tell Minister Min. Not yet. This is the weapon, but we don't know if that man is the killer. You saw how good he is with knives. Anyone could have taken the knife, like the way I just did. How dare you try to run! I bought you and your sister with my money. That means you can't even die unless I give permission! We got Byul. No! She didn't do anything wrong! It was all my fault! She got her period! She's menstruating! Get her something to eat. Okay. I'm so sorry, Oak. Why do you need a camera? You'll find out soon enough. We have the party's guest list. Good. What about His Majesty? He's not on the list. What? They won't even invite the king? Those damn Japanese. Put this on the front page. Yes, sir. Jin-ho. You should snoop around the Governor's office. They keep throwing these big parties but no one knows where the money comes from. No. You know I don't do anything dangerous. This could get dangerous. Soo-hyun and the Commissioner were killed by the same guy. We found the weapon at the circus, so that piece of cloth must have come from the circus. It must belong to the killer. We have to find the clothes. What do you want? We wanted to write about your circus for the newspaper. You put on a great show. This can be free advertising. Free? Yes. We'll even take a picture of you. Okay. Don't move. Smile. Smile for the camera. He says smile! Thank you. Here we go. 2. 3. Kids. I'll help you with the laundry. Who are you? Do you have to do all this on your own? This looks hard. Orchids... What are you doing? I... I was just... This is the circus master's room. You can't go in there. Get out. Now. Okay. Thank you. Doc, we have to go. Hurry! I want to help these girls. What? Mister? Is that a camera? Why? Can you take a picture of me and my sister? No. We have to leave. Please? Hey! Can't we take one picture? Fine. Here we go. Look at the camera. We don't have time for this. - Look over here. - Gather round! Look at the camera. Look. Hey! I'm talking to you! Why don't you ever listen? This is Jin-ho. I'm writing because I thought you'd want to know. You were right about the killer being in the circus. My bet is on Uk-kwan, the circus master. His knife was a match to the weapon used. He's like two different people. I don't know what to make of him. His behavior is very odd. I need you to find out more by talking to women in high society. I'm going to keep an eye on the circus master. Bull's-eye! Awful things have been happening. I would have stayed home all day if you hadn't asked me to come. We need to stick together in times like this. Did you see the Commissioner's wife? She looked awful. I know. Did you hear the rumors? What rumors? I heard the Commissioner had a weird little hobby. Bull's-eye! How’d you find this body? He looks just like Soo-hyun. You don't have to know that. He was caught stealing rice cakes. He'll do what you want. Slow down. You'll get sick. Have some kimchi. Is that okay? Are you the head officer? Yes. Are you really going to look after my family if I do this? Yes. I promise. I need two cows. That's all my family needs. Fine. Now eat up. Since you're here, can you confess to one more crime? Extra! Extra! Serial killer caught! I Killed Min Soo-hyun Serial Killer Caught Targeted Upper Class Officer Oh found the killer! Killer's been caught! New Hero Born Extra! Extra! Extra! Extra! Killer caught! No... Son! No! Grab him! Son! I know him. I performed surgery on him. Son! Dad! These are Soo-hyun's clothes! It's him! You! I'll kill you! I know you! I did your surgery! You didn't kill him! I know you didn't! Why are you doing this? Young-dal used lye. What a cheap trick. Let me in! No! Hey! What can I do for you? Should I take this to Minister Min? Where'd you hide the body? What if the real killer strikes again? Do you think you'll get away with that? What is it you want? I want three days. I'll find the killer. I'll give you two. The Minister won't wait. Till then, don't hang the wrong guy. Gotcha! What the hell do you want? I can smell the stench of death on you. I know you killed the two men. You must be out of your mind. I can kill you right here. Is that what you want? You killed them with this knife. I found a piece of your shirt inside the Commissioner's mouth. What? Drop the knife. Are we having fun? Yes! Our next show has never been done in Korea before. Do you have any loved ones? Who are you? If you do, you would have done the same thing I did. You must be his brother. Why did you kill them? Unless you're a cop, leave us alone. Jin-ho? Are you okay? It's me. Doc... There are two of them... What? What do you mean it's not the circus master? What? No! Oak... Wake up... That wasn't supposed to happen. I'm so sorry. We'll start the show again soon. Sir. Sir! You can't leave! She's not dead! I can save her! Oak is not breathing. You killed her. What are you saying? We raised her as our own. What are you doing? I need to make an airway! Sis... How many more do I have to kill? You? You killed them? This has to stop. You! You ruined everything! Please... Stop... She's breathing! Uk-kwan... Please stop... Doctor! You have to save her! You can't come in here looking like that! What are you doing? I'm sorry, but you have to save this little girl. Oak... Wake up... Come back tomorrow. Sir. Please. We have procedures. She has to be administered first. I'm aware of the procedure, but she can't wait another minute. There are no exceptions. I'm sorry. You're turning her away because you know she's poor. You're supposed to be a doctor! How dare you! Stop it! Fine. If you won't save her, I will. You couldn't even take care of your own brother? At least he won't be killing anyone anymore. I'll wrap up this case somehow. You go back to your job. There are men waiting for you. Did you find the real killer? I see Uk-kwan knocked you up pretty good. Do you two know each other? Is that a problem? No. You make a nice pair. I don't ever want to see you again. Get yourself to the hospital. Use the rest to get a drink or two. I was your boss once. You could be little more generous. You've gotten greedy over the years. Are you just going to leave? Come in. You were hurt many times because of me. Lieutenant Hong. I was in the Royal Guard then. I depended on you back then. You had fearless eyes. What's holding you back? You don't want to lose this. You've already lost me once. The women told me something about the Commissioner. One of his farmers accused him of killing his daughter. His 9-year-old girl died bleeding from below. There is a secret club of rich, influential men. The circus master's been seen with them often. Where is he? Namsan... Behind Namsan... I'm sorry. You didn't do anything wrong. It's okay. Who are you? Who sent you? Do you know who I am? I am Governor Murata! You won't get away with this! She's not even 10 years old. She's just a baby. Don't kill me... The circus master supplied the girls, and Officer Oh introduced him to men like Min Soo-hyun. It was the Governor's turn today. I need your help. What's your plan? They like a good show, so we'll give them one. Are you saying Ung-kwan is posing as his brother? I talked to him a few days ago, and he seemed like himself. How can you tell? They're twins. Why would he do that? He's finishing the job. He's getting the girls' revenge. The next wound is 6 cm long, below the sternum. Who do you think he'll go after next? I won't go down so easily. Governor! Sir. What did you do? It was like this when I came. You're lying! I know you're Ung-kwan! What? You saw me kill him. Shut up! He's killed in the same way the others were killed! I'm telling you it wasn't me. Besides, you know the method of killing better than anyone. How dare you! I don't care who you are. You're both dirty lowlifes! I told you it was like this when I came. You're the one who always lies out of his ass. I got you this job with those girls, and now you're turning on me? I see you're all here. It wasn't too hard to set this up. Did you have a nice nap, Governor? Morphine... So that was it. That's why you gave them the girls. Well? Are you shaking yet? Are you trembling in fear? I didn't think I'd have to give up my life. Were you going to rat me out for selling those girls? No. That's what cops do. Are you sure about this? It's not easy leaving behind the life you know, but I want the life I've always dreamed of. Won't you come with me? I'm all out of money. I've got some girls to look after. I hope you'll fulfill your dream. Let me know what's out there in the West. I will. I'll come back the greatest scientist in Korea. Take care. You, too. "Governor Murata was deported to Japan. If it wasn't for two unidentified young men..." They must have been brave boys. "Korea would have witnessed an all-out opium war." Would you like some noodles? There haven't been a lot of cheating wives lately. Doc? How's your work going? I'm a real doctor now, not a med student. You don't need to brag. Prayer Meeting at Bakdal Church 6:00 P.M. Do you think Mrs. Park is really back? I apologize. I hope you'll understand. I hear you helped get rid of Governor Murata. Korea could have turned into an opium battleground if it wasn't for you. I don't even know where to begin. It all started when... We didn't expect any of this. I've heard of people like you in the West. They are called detectives. I lost a valuable letter. I hope you can find it for me. Letter? Yes. Will you take the job? It might be dangerous. As long as we get paid, it's good. I need you to go to The Hague, in the Netherlands. You'll find the letter there. I will find that letter for you, Your Majesty. What? That was the king! Yes! Did you see him? Did you? I saw the king! He's one handsome king! Thank you! Very handsome! We're going to The Hague! Let's go!
