MRS. HOLLAMBY: Morning, ma'am. We've got a new allocation. This is Rachel Hicks, first-time young offender. Another drug addict come to join us. Welcome to G Wing, Rachel. I'm principal officer Mr. Fenner. You've met senior officer Mrs. Hollamby. MRS. HOLLAMBY: You lot call me "miss." No, we don't. We call you "Bodybag!" MRS. HOLLAMBY: Shut it! And this is junior officer Mr. Mattison. Hi. First day's the worst. You'll soon get your bearings. Here's her file. Make an appointment with my secretary for her induction. Don't have to take up your valuable time, ma'am. Leave Rachel with me. Come on. (SOBBING) MRS. HOLLAMBY: Log book, ma'am. MR. FENNER: One more for breakfast, Julies. BOTH: One coming up, Mr. Fenner. Get yourself fed, Rachel, I'll find you a bed. That's his specialty. I'll find you a bed down the block if you don't shut it, Wade! Ooh! Like he'd be interested in that little minger. Fresh meat, better than leftovers. I ain't sittin' next to this lowlife. (CLAMORING) Cha! There's more doin' dealin's in here than down King's Cross. Skip the saint act, Gordon! I don't remember Jesus saying, "Blessed are the shoplifters." MISS STEWART: Mrs. Hollamby! I'll deal with this. No, you've got me wrong, I was only done for two E's! E's for evil. (ALL SHOUTING) MISS STEWART: That is enough! Nobody is here to be judged. We are all of us in this prison to try and help you get you out of it. Yeah, okay. Me and Den's up for that, miss. Just give us the key and we'll be off. I am trying to treat you women with respect. Please don't make me think you don't deserve any. Nice idea. Pity you don't tell it to the screws. Miss Stewart. I was expecting to find you in your office. Well, it's got a great desk, sir, but a lousy view of the prison. Well, I prefer the more hands-on approach. Indeed. Well, I came to inform you that your probationary period, though not without incident, has been deemed a success. Congratulations. Thank you, sir. Now I can really hope to make a difference. (CHUCKLING) Come. Just remember, whatever new ideas you've got in mind, prison is a place with two types of people in it. Us and them. ♪ Maybe I'm a fool to think that I could do some good ♪ But if I didn't think I could ♪ I wouldn't be here ♪ Now I have a chance to really do this ♪ My own way ♪ I won't let anyone say ♪ I shouldn't be here Don't worry, Rachel.

You've got to take me to the hospital, please. You've been on your last flaming legs since I've been in uniform. Oh, come on, miss, it's not been that long. You just get back to your cell and save your lungs. Yes, miss. Thank you, miss. Thank you. I gotta be excused an' all, miss. Got the decorators in, innit? What, again? All right, Dockley, take the morning. Thank you, sir. Thank me later. Go on. Right. This way, Rachel. Come on. Got you a cell of your own, nice and private. In you go. Get your bed made up, put your own things out. Soon feel like home, eh? (SOBBING) I wish I'd swapped those two E's for a load of sleeping pills! Now, now, come on, love. It's not the end of the world, is it? It is. I've lost everything now. Here. Have a good blow. Now, take a deep breath, tell Uncle Jim what's the trouble. See what he can do. It's Maddy. Hmm? My baby. I'm still meant to be breastfeeding, she won't look at her bottle. I didn't know you had a little baby. Yeah, but social got her, took into care. Only till you get out of prison, love, then they'll give her back to you, won't they? What if they don't? I'll be chucked out of me home by then, 'cause social stops your rent. They won't give you back your baby if you haven't got a home, but council won't rehome you unless you've got a baby! Rachel, have you ever heard of the Brotherhood of Freemasons? No. Well, I'm gonna let you in to a big secret. There's men like me in every walk of life, got the power to pull all sorts of strings for each other. You mean like you're all on the fiddle? Not for ourselves, no. We use our influence to protect the weak and needy. And I can jump you to the top of any housing list you fancy. Really? Place in the country, cottage by the sea. Three-bed semi with a little nursery. Oh, I just want a flat in Blackpool. (CHUCKLING) Well, better put a smile on that face for me, then. (CHUCKLING) Here you are. I can tell you're special, Rachel. That's why I'll be keeping a very special eye on you. That's a promise. (KISSING) (BUZZER SOUNDING) MAN ON PA:All inmates are reminded to make beds before movement. Watcha! Thought I'd better come and see if there's anything you need. Being as how you're not carrying, you'll be buying, right? Crack? Smack? Whatever you fancy. I'm gonna report you to Mr. Fenner. What do you think he's gonna do for you? He said he's gonna keep a special eye on me. Did he, now? Tell you what eye that is, the one on the end of his dick.

Oh, I'd prefer a G and T, the morning I've had. You never have a good morning, do you, Sylvia? 'Scuse me! Justin! Better hop it down to reception, there's a sweat box due back from court. Why do they keep sending us prisoners? Eh? Don't they know Sylvia's on her tea break? (CHUCKLING) You can see who that little pup's licking up to, can't you? Mr. Fenner! (GROANING) What is it now, Rachel? Oh, I need to talk to you, sir. Private, like. This isn't a drop-in center, you know. Please, sir! All right, all right, all right. Come on. (CHUCKLING) Mr. Popular! Come on. (SOBBING) Now, what's the problem, Rachel? That Shell Dockley. What about her? Her and her mate's been trying to get me on smack! Don't you worry about Dockley, I'll deal with her. Thanks, sir. I told her I'd report her to you. Well, she better not find out you have her, she'll rip her tongue out! But... You'll stop her, won't you? Rachel, look. I can't give you special treatment if you go round telling everyone about it. I'm gonna report her to Miss Stewart. Miss Stewart? She's been in prison for about as long as you have, love. But fine. If you'd rather trust her than me. No! Sir, please. Hmm? I'm sorry if I said the wrong thing. All right, all right. Look. I just can't do it. It's only me can keep you safe and get you back your baby, but you've got to keep this shut. Okay? Hey, hey... Trust me? Yeah. Good girl. Now, go and report for work. Go on! Problem? If you ask me, that one's got "victim" written all over her, poor kid. No one's a victim on my wing. That's why I'm taking her under my wing, ma'am. Book her in to see me first thing tomorrow. Can I fetch you a foot stool, Sylvia? Oh. (CLEARING THROAT) (STUTTERING) Er, sorry, ma'am, I was just, um... Skiving? Not me, Miss Stewart! I live and breathe for this prison. Well, living and breathing isn't quite enough, I'm afraid. You've got to move about a bit as well. So when you've caught up with your other duties, I want you to find Nikki Wade and upgrade her cell. What? You're putting a known troublemaker like Wade on enhanced? Giving her privileges? Her appeal came through today. It's our job to give her every encouragement she needs to win it. What, so she can murder another man in a fit of jealous rage? She's lucky we're not allowed to give her a good hanging. Oh, really! Well, you can't believe she stabbed a broken bottle in that copper's neck by accident? That copper was trying to rape her girlfriend. They've always got an excuse. Oh, for goodness sake! Are you sure you're not getting too personally involved here? All I'm just saying is she's not a homicidal maniac. No. Just a homosexual murderess. Society needs protecting. We need protecting. Well, if you'd rather execute prisoners, Sylvia, I suggest you apply for a job in Texas. Just a minute. You say you're worried about Rachel Hicks. How are we supposed to keep her safe with the likes of Wade let off the leash? It's like throwing a chop to a Rottweiler. You don't know anything about the women in here, do you? With all due respect, ma'am, us old lockhands know a bit about jailcraft. Bottom line is, you go soft on a hard case like Wade... Well, that's good order and discipline dead and done for. I'll tell you what's dead and done for. You treating these women like children! Canceling their visits, losing their letters. The whole bag of dirty tricks you've used to make their lives a misery. So stop living in the past and carry out my orders. Well, that's it, then, Jim. End of an era. Time to bring on the chronic backache and sign off on the sick. Maybe not, Sylv. I think she's just shot herself in the foot. How's that? Well, talk about high-risk strategy. If Wade kicks off again, and let's face it, that won't be hard to arrange, then Stewart will be in a right mess. Ha!

Yeah, but... What's she done to get given special privvies? Just wait by the gates at escort to work. Wade, go and pack your bags. You ain't packing nothing 'cept my fist, you shitpiece! Whoa-ho-ho! Stay away from me! What's her problem? Turned governor's grass, have you? What are you on about, you crackhead? (BOTH YELLING) Go on, Nikki, kick her in the fanny!

It was just getting good. And you can stop stirring and get back to your cell. Go to work, Dockley! Come on, show's over. Move it! Come on, Dockley! Haven't got all day, move yourself! SHELL: All right, keep your hair on. You just can't control that vicious temper, can you, Wade? Shame, because apparently your appeal came through today. What appeal? (CHUCKLING) Too late for regrets now. Take her down the block, Mr. Mattison. Get off me, you bastards! That's enough! What's this about my appeal? Miss Stewart's got you a court hearing.

Nikki, this is your chance to get back together with your girlfriend. You can't give up on her now. Yeah, that's right, I can't. 'Cause she's got together with somebody else. Oh. Look, I'm so sorry. Yeah, well, don't worry. If I'd known I'd lose the girl, I'd still have stabbed the bloody guy. Can't control my vicious temper, can I? (SCOFFING) So you're just gonna play the martyr, are you? Feel sorry for yourself. Yeah, that's right. Do you mind? Yes. I do, actually. You're going to work, and then back on the wing. What? I'm overruling Fenner and I'm moving you back to enhanced. And I want you to go to court and bloody well fight for your freedom, Nikki. Not just for you, but for all the other women in here. Deal? You're the boss. On you go. (CHUCKLING) Ah! Any jobs you want a hand with, sir? We don't mind getting dirty for you. But we do insist on using rubbers. Look, Julies, do you have to keep this up? Keep what up, loverboy? That! Harassing me. Respect works both ways, you know. Well, sorry darling, only showing our appreciation. We're not used to men treating us nice. Well, that's a good reason to try and change your ways, isn't it? Start afresh. Do that every time I get out, innit? We're not educated like you, sir. The only jobs we can do are against the bleedin' law. Even when half the punters out there are the bleedin' law. Oh, hi. Er, tell Mr. Fenner I've sent Nikki Wade back to work and then she'll be moving cells. Julie, can I have a word? Bleedin' hell! What have I done now? (LAUGHING) Yes, miss? I've had a call about your son, David. Well, what about him? Oh, no, he's all right, isn't he, miss? Tell me. Don't worry, Julie, there's nothing wrong with him. But social services say there's been a problem with the care arrangements you've made for him over the school holidays. Eh? What's my arrangements got to do with social bleedin' services? No! My David's staying with his auntie Sandra. Sorted. His auntie Sandra. Unfortunately his auntie Sandra has also been taken into custody. Oh, shit. Social services have found a foster home for him. What? You mean... You mean they're sticking my son in an 'ouse with a couple of strangers to look after him? He's too young to look after himself, Julie. Oh, look, I'm sure your son knows how much you love him. I'll try and get a number for you to call him. Oh, my God, Ju. Well, what if I have to tell him the truth? You can't do that, Ju. He thinks his mum's a top international travel agent. That's why you have to spend so much time away, innit? Why you sent him to boarding school. You can't tell him you're on the game and in the nick. Oh, why do they punish our kids? I mean, it's not their fault what their rotten mum's done. Should have seen this coming, Ju.

You ain't gettin' it. Shell's doing life for topping the last tart who got on her tits. You should be scared of her. (GASPING) I don't do scared. And I think your balls are on the floor. (PRISONERS LAUGHING) Going down, Denny Blood! All sorted, darling. You can wipe that smile off your face, Atkins. You might be famous on the outside, but you won't be in here. Wanna bet? You're in cell 7. Move it. Who's the concierge? You lot call me "miss" and you move it, or you're on report. Sylvia Hollamby, oh, that's right. As in Mr. RJ Hollamby, funeral directors, care of number 13, Cherry Tree Crescent, London SW9 4PQ. How does she know that? She's a witch. Not from me. From my husband, Charlie. He provides a lot of business for undertakers. If you want me to put in a good word for your old man, miss... You're on free association till lockup. (CHEERING) And you're on paperwork! Oh, ladies, I do hope you know how to party. Come on, girls, roll up, roll up. Hey, Noreen. I know you like Malibu, don't you? Go for that, girl. Christ, I thought this place was all bars and no booze. Do you know, the screw that was supposed to search me didn't fancy a visit from my Charlie neither. Cheers. Cheers. I don't need any of that. Hey! Here's an invite for you two an' all if you want to have a good time. Eh? I only do nasty if I can't do nice. Go on. Shell? Yeah, right. Go with the flow, innit? Only one who wants us to have a bad time is that Bible basher. Right, Crystal? Ain't no Commandment says, "Thou shalt not shake thy booty." Get him a rum, just kiddin'. (ALL TALKING EXCITEDLY) Now then, who is this little Cinderella then, eh? Are you not coming to the ball, darling? I don't know anyone. Right, well, I think you and me should stick together, eh? Come on. Have a swig of this. My special cocktail, soon get you in the mood. What's in it? Well, it's (CLEARING THROAT) two parts sweet dreams and one part dynamite.

It's the least I can do after you sticking your neck out for me. You're taking a hell of a risk, aren't you? I don't believe prison should be about us and them, Nikki. I don't believe most of these women should even be here. I never doubted you were telling the truth about your case, so I hope you believe we're on the same side now. Yeah, apart from the odd set of bars and a 10-foot wall. Seriously, you've given me the first hope I've had in ages. Even lightened up enough to let my hair down tonight. Would that explain the whiff of alcohol I detected on the wing? Do I have the right to remain silent? No! (LAUGHING) Do I have the right to tell you you're gorgeous? Uh...

Miss Stewart, I know how you must be feeling, but let me assure you, one tragic mistake need not be the end of a promising career, provided you're prepared to cooperate. Cooperate? With this pack of lies?Helen! Well, obviously if the government wanted us to tell the truth about what happens in prisons, why would it insist we all sign the Official Secrets Act? (MOBILE RINGING) Jesus. Yes? Oh, almost. Certainly, Your Ladyship. No, no, I will be there. No, I'm just... I'll be along shortly. Very good. Yes, right, goodbye. Look, the important thing is knowing when to move on. You're talking about covering up what caused a young woman's death. Had you followed Mr. Fenner's advice about Wade, she might still be alive. Nikki Wade was no threat to Rachel. Well, she was certainly instrumental in causing a riot. Oh! (LAUGHS) This is all from Fenner, isn't it? Helen, you made the mistake of becoming involved with a dangerous and manipulative inmate. The case is closed, whether you like it or not. Well, I don't like it. I don't like it one bit. Your only option is where you go from here, and face it, Helen, you are going. And I'll tell you where. To a tribunal. Oh, don't be ridiculous. I'm not leaving these women with Fenner. I'm gonna fight this all the way. Then you'll lose everything. Not my principles. They're worth more to me than a bloody pension! I sincerely advise you to think again, Miss Stewart, and swiftly! (BUZZER SOUNDS) MAN ON PA SYSTEM: Unlock will now commence. Those bastards should be giving us silver service! I thought they was waiting for us all to top ourselves. Top ourselves, yeah. They just better tell us what's been done about Rachel. Yeah, because we want an explanation for this situation. Be quiet! Now, I will tell you what's what. You do that and it better be good! There's been a tragic set of circumstances on this wing... Oh. ...which should never have been allowed to happen. And rest assured, Miss Stewart will be taking full responsibility, so no more bending the rules. From now on, it's back to basics. Which means you lot better start behaving like good girls. Got that?

Yeah, respect, man. 'Cause if we don't get it, you lot don't get nothing. Get it? Have you lost the plot? Do you really not care what happened to Rachel? Ain't nothing happened to her ain't happened to me. Tell her to piss off, Den. Piss off. All right, ladies, let's clear these decks, shall we, 'cause we're all done here and you, tell Fenner we're all going on strike. That's hunger strike, ladies! Hunger strike! Bring this place down! BLOOD: Whatever! Like we give a shit. Nikki, you've gotta stop this. Oh, who the hell do you think I am, head bloody prefect? This isn't gonna help anything. Look, wait by the gate. Julie, Miss Stewart asked me to give you this. It's the number of the foster home where your son is. She remembers. She's not giving up on any of you women.

That'll drag out the aggro for months! Cost the taxpayer a fortune, not to mention the damage she could do to this prison's good reputation. I think you should know, it's your reputation she's gunning for, Jim. I've gotta go to assuage the board of governors. It proves what I told you, sir. How she's got too close to the cons, let herself be influenced. Well then, other influences will have to be brought to bear, hmm? My responsibility is simply to ensure that a head rolls, and much though I'd prefer it not to be yours, Jim, whatever happens, it's not going to be mine. Shit! Shit. (SIGHS) God! Jim! Oh, Sylvia! Just tell me, how did it go? In the right direction. Just a slight unforeseen hold-up. What's that? Stewart still thinks she's got a leg to stand on. What? After a suicide and an all-out riot? Take one more cock-up to clinch it. Any tips such as? Such as? Such as? Such as a load of class-A turning up on the wing, for instance, due to her stopping our routine searches. (LAUGHS) Well, a nod's as good as a wink to me. (BOTH LAUGHING) JUSTIN: Nikki Wade for you. Thanks, Justin, will you wait outside? (EXHALES) So, what did they give you, a cushy desk job in area management? I wish you'd shut up and stop giving Fenner another excuse to send you down. Oh, I don't need to give him one, do I? He's a rapist. Whatever he wants, he takes. And all you've bloody well done is play into his hands, Nikki! Me? You're the naive do-gooder who thinks she can turn this place into a girl guide camp. No, no... I stupidly thought if I gave you another chance, at least you'd have the sense to stay out of trouble. But no, you go and kick up a full-scale riot! I had no choice. Rachel Hicks died. Has anyone even asked Fenner what he was doing that night? No, everybody's asking me what I was doing letting you back on the wing, and I can't answer them, can I? Well, you can't let Fenner win. Nobody'll be safe in here if he gets your job. Don't think I don't blame myself. I failed. I should've spoken to Rachel sooner, but I just didn't think for one minute... I just... Oh! Hey... Look, we're on the same side, remember? We'll fight together. Don't beat yourself up. Helen, please. Oh, sorry! Just, you went very quiet and I wondered if, um... What, if I've returned to my murdering ways? Uh, take Nikki back to her cell, please, I'm going home to work on my case. Right, I'll be round straight after my shift, then. Oh, yeah, that'll be great. Oh, I'll come too, shall I? Bring a bottle? Good night, Nikki. Right. I see you didn't waste much time then. How cozy! PRISONER 1: You can't kill us all, Fenner!

Oh, hi! Ready for a drink? Oh, a large one, yeah. Thanks. Oh... You look nice. Cheers. How's it reading? Pfft! I can fight till I drop, Justin, but, I'm never gonna win this without a scrap of evidence. I can't believe Rachel didn't leave a note. Ah, I'm kicking myself for letting Fenner go into her cell on his own! I swear the women are right about him. Well, here's to hopeless causes. You're not that, Helen. You're the reason... Maybe they're right. I don't deserve this job. I get too emotionally involved. Because you care! I'm only staying in the job myself, because of you. Oh, God, Justin, don't! Oh, shit, sorry. You're well out of my league. (LAUGHS) It's not that. It's... You know, I just... I... Jesus! I know you're under a lot of pressure. No, it's not that. Well, what? What is it? (EXHALES) It's Nikki Wade. Oh, don't let Nikki Wade get under your skin. She already has. What do you mean? I think you know what I mean.

Well, it's your funeral! (LAUGHS) BIGGS: Oh, miss. Time and motion, innit, Den? Let's dish it out. Let's clear it up. Exactly, man. Right, I wanna work on the weakest link. Move it, grandma. What? Out of the way. Oh, Gordon Bennett! All right, Denny. You know you're making a big mistake, girl, runnin' around after that screw's slag. Yeah? Well, a tray of sausages to meself says you don't know shit, innit? All right. Is that all you want out of life, is it? Dockley's leftovers? It'll be you lot screwed when Fenner's boss. Me and Shell's gonna get special everything then. Denny. Denny, look, I know you've had a tough life, I know you have, children's homes and that, no wonder you wanna be special to somebody. But what you're really looking for is a mum, yeah? (LAUGHS) What are you, some sort of undercover probation officer? I'm just trying to give you a break, Denny. Why don't you leave me alone? Because maybe I could do with a second chance an' all, for being a lousy mum to my own kids! But I can't make it up to them 'cause one's dead, and the other's doing life for murder. So... What do you reckon, eh? I reckon you're just trying to mess with my head. Do yourself a favor, Denny! And do Dockley one as well, 'cause if she thinks she's anything special to Fenner... Come on, you know what that bastard's about. He'll bin her off like a shot and where will you be then, Den? Up yours, Atkins! She's her own worst enemy, that one. She can't see past Dockley. We're stuffed, ain't we? Stuffed. That is the one thing... We ain't. You know, I can do without food. I can even do without booze, but I can't do without... Don't go there! I don't. Nor me. No way. Who needs it? BOTH: Not us! ATKINS: Oh, yeah? Well, I can't think of nothing else most nights. Well, You should be ashamed of yourself at a time like this. You should be thinking about what happened to poor Rachel.

(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING) Nikki, can I talk to you? About Helen. Oh, no, thanks, spare me the details. For God's sake, she's risking everything for you women! If you want to help her beat Fenner, you'd better act before it's too late. Look, she doesn't give a toss about what I could do for her, darling. Yeah? Well, I wish you were right about that. But she can't tell you what she feels about you, can she? Eh? What are you talking about? The point is, you'll never find out if we don't put a stop to Fenner. And he's going to use every dirty trick in the book now. HOLLAMBY: Mr. Mattison, we've had a tip-off, that there's a large stash of illegal drugs here on the wing... (ALL CHATTING) Where? Which I sincerely hope for Miss Stewart's sake, we don't find. (ALL CHATTING) HOLLAMBY: Dockley, Blood, stand aside. Eh? We're conducting a drugs search in this servery. Ain't no drugs around here. Then we won't find any, will we? But if we do, then obviously we'll know whose they are. Hmm, what I've been saying, innit? (ALL CHATTING) Ah, ha, hmm. And what's this? What it says, innit? Sugar. And since when did sugar come individually wrapped by the gram? Yes, say it there. Looks like cocaine to us, Dockley. You want me to do a taste test? Oh, shut it, Biggs! Well, anyone tells you it's mine, they're lying, right? Ain't hers neither, is it, Den? Give mine to Shell to stash in her cell, innit? (ALL YELLING) Mr. Mattison! Take Dockley down the block. I shall take this to the lab and report to Mr. Fenner. Hallelujah! And get the rest of them banged up. (ALL PROTESTING) I've been framed, innit? Someone's friggin' fit me up. Got it in one, Dockley.

He's trying to help us screw Fenner. You what? Who is it wants to shaft Miss Stewart, so he can get her job, and the pick of any new girl he fancies? ALL: Fenner. Who else? Do you trust me now? Well, obvious, innit, Shell? Don't talk drivel. Ah! Me and him's got a deal. Oh, he's just using you, you soppy cow. No, I'm his eyes and ears, right? Whoa-ho, tits and arse, more like!

You're on your own, Dockley. (ALL YELLING) Quiet, you lot! Thank you, Mrs. Hollamby. I have here the report resulting from the official enquiry, into events subsequent to the previous, and I can only say, I wish that your concerns about Mr. Fenner had been brought to my attention earlier. As if you'd have done anything about it, man. You were too busy playing golf. You should be sacked, you old bastard. (LAUGHING) Silence! I assure you, as soon as he's fit to be discharged from hospital, Mr. Fenner will be brought to justice. Here, here, here... You saying he didn't snuff it? Oh! Oh, well, better luck next time, eh?
