[Subtitle by Vishu] All the world's a stage. All the people are characters in it. Is it not? Birth and death... To face the challenges in the life between... Man does many things... Puts different clothes on... Plays different roles... He lies... Why do all this? To fill one's stomach... and to clothe oneself. This world where one thinks, 'I shall live and I only, shall live'... the one with intelligence and power rises... and the one without, perishes. In a world filled with such competition, with only his intelligence... and making an easy living by tricking and hoodwinking others... this Lambodhara survives and is our story's protagonist. Hear him tell you who a smart man is. One who spins a top without a string is a smart man. Anyone can spin a top given the string. Now see, I have to go to Chamarajapet. Bus fare is one rupee. An auto rickshaw ride would cost me ten rupees. I don't have even a cent in my pocket. Still I'll manage to go to Chamarajapet. And I wouldn't even consider walking. That doesn't suit me. Then how will I go there? Keep watching. Will you take me to Chamarajapet? No. Hello. Hello. Going to Chamarajapet? Yes. Why do you ask? I too am going there. If one travels in an auto, it would cost 10-12 rupees. If we go together, we can share. Why not? I too save 6 rupees. Good idea. One minute, I'll bring my friend too. OK. Curse these autos. No one's willing to go. Where are you going, sir? Chamarajapet, sir. You're alone? Yes. I'll bring an auto and take you to Chamarajapet in 6 rupees. 6 rupees? How? I have a friend there. We shall share the fare. 50-50? Why not? I'll save 6 rupees, good idea. Yes, good idea. I'll just come back. Your name? M.Kumar. Yours? Lambodhar. Wait here, I'll bring the auto. OK sir. Will you take me to Chamarajapet? Yes. We are 3 people. That's OK. Please come. Hey, you can finish your cigarette. Just stop here. Please come sir. Hey Kumar. Kumar, six rupees. Six rupees. Stop here, I'll get down. Here? My house is close by. I would've dropped you near home. That's OK, I'll walk. Stop, I'll get down here. Why sir? We could've... No, the road is narrow. Auto can't turn back. OK. Right. That's enough, stop here. How much is it? 10 rupees 30 paise. Ten rupees. 30 Paise... Do you have change for a 100? It's Ok leave it sir. What is this, Lambodhara? Whenever I ask, you tell me that you didn't get a job... or don't have any money. But still travel in auto rickshaws. I can't understand your ways. One need not have money in his pocket to travel in an auto. Intelligence in brain is enough. Poor fellows who paid for the auto got down in the middle and walked home. I, who didn't pay, rode on the auto till home. Over that... 2 rupees net profit. This is Lambodhara's technique. You're impossible man. That's OK but what have you planned for the evening? Evening? Why? House owner will come asking for the rent. Last time, you somehow sweet talked and drove him away. But this time nothing's going to work. He'll throw you out and insult you. Is that all? I'll give him the rent. But you say you don't have any money? I'll earn some. How's that? Keep watching. [Prop: Shrinivas Shetty] Namaskara, Shrinivas Shetty. I'm not Shrinivas Shetty but his son Panduranga Shetty. Where's Shrinivas Shetty? Look there. He left all of us. When? It's written there itself. On first? He was with me the previous day. Sipping coffee in Hotel Parag, he told me... 'This business might probably end with me.' 'My son Panduranga doesn't have the smartness to run the business.' I consoled him. I told him,'Shetty, everyone's like that in the beginning.' 'And would learn the business once they start working.' Didn't expect things to turn so bad this soon. That coffee was the last coffee of our friendship. Oh god. Forget it. What can anyone do? All these relations and friendships lasts only till the fate allows. OK. Take this, Shetty. 2 rupees. What do you want? Nothing. I came back to clear the accounts. On 17th, I had bought some items from your father. I had paid 70 rupees and I owed 2 rupees balance. Suddenly, I had this urgent work in Kumbakonam and I went. I came today. Thought I'll meet your father and... pay the balance, But here... Oh, it's only 2 rupees. No, I'll be content only when I've repaid my dues. I'll Leave. Don't stop coming because my father died. No,no. Keep coming. OK, I'll keep coming. What an honest man. Because of people like him, there's plenty rain and bountiful harvest. One can easily give things on credit to people like him. Give me a Pears soap. Hey, give one Pears soap. Hearing Shetty's death... I forgot. What do you want? One Surf packet. Hey, give sir a Surf packet. And then a Horlicks bottle. Small or large? Give a large one. Pack a large Horlicks bottle. With that, 2 vermicelli packets, 1 Lifebuoy soap. And a Parachute coconut oil bottle. and 10 Eclair chocolates. If you have a bag, please put them in that. OK,OK. How much is it? 159. Oh, all my money is in my pant and I've come here wearing pyjama. I'll just come back with the money. No problem. Take this with you. You can pay when you come back. I don't like debts. How long can it take to bring the money? I'll be back in a jiffy. Oh, that's alright. You take this. Take this with you. Many thanks. I'll come back with the money. Ok. What is it Puttajji? Where are you going? It's my fate. Though there are children and grandchildren at home, I still have to do all the chores. Oh, What did you want? One surf packet. That's all? Take this. You needn't drag your feet to the shop for that. Give me 32 rupees. Here's 35 rupees. I'll give back the change later. May god bless you. What Ratnakar? Where are you going? I was going to buy a Horlicks bottle and Parachute coconut oil. This is what you want? Yes. 105 rupees. You seem to have opened a mobile provision store? I just wanted to help my neighbours. That's all. What help can you do for me Lambodhar? For you...A Lifebuoy? Lifebuoy soap. 5 rupees. Lambu uncle.. Yes your Lambu uncle has brought you toffees. Have them. Where did the other one go? Ah, here it is. Give me a kiss. Venkamma. You were scolding your husband for not bringing vermicelli, right? Take this. How did you know? Oh, won't I know what goes on in every household in this neighbourhood? 15 rupees. And for the toffees you gave to the children? I gave that for the love of children. Your children are like mine, right? What? I mean all the children in the neighbourhood are like my own. Take this change. Let that house owner come. As soon as the bell is rung, everyone comes to me and pay their rent. This Lambodhara is an exception. Lambodhara... Lambodhara... Please come sir. I was waiting for you. Stop lying. When I asked for rent last month, you said you'd pay two months rent together. Pay the rent. I never said I wouldn't pay. You never said that but you aren't paying too. Sir, I'm an unemployed well past the age limit for employment. Wait for two months. I'll pay your rent. You have to pay me today. Or else vacate the house. Do you understand? Yes sir. I had some 150 rupees for food. I'll give that. Yes, give that. And I'll bear the starvation that awaits me. Sir. My name is Jnaanamurthy, sir. I'm managing my studies with the help of charity sir. I have to pay this year's school fees, sir. I'm poor sir. I want to study more. I'm going to everyone's house and seeking help. Please help me with whatever money you can, sir. I'm poor sir. Please help me sir. If I don't pay the fees, all my efforts this year will be in vain sir. How much do you have to pay? 150 rupees sir. Sir, I can't bear to watch someone struggling for their studies. I just give whatever I have on hand. Take this boy. Just study well and come back and tell me that passed with good grade. That's all I want in return. I couldn't hold myself after hearing his story, sir. I gave him the money. I'll arrange the money for you next month. If it's OK with you, fine. Otherwise you take the money back I gave that boy yourself. I can't do that. Lambodhara... I didn't know your heart was so big. Why would I take the money back from that boy? That's alright. Next month you can pay me three months' rent together. OK sir. Boy Jnaanamurthy... Take the blessing of the elder. Get up boy. Get up. Get up. Become a learned man. I'll leave sir. I won't forget your help sir. OK. I'll also leave Lambodhara. OK sir. Take this boss, your 150 rupees. You acted well. Take this, enjoy. I have to maintain the trust with Shetty. I had only 100 rupees in my pants. Balance? That's alright, you can pay me later. Can I take read this paper? Take it. Reporters are wanted for 'Vishala Karnataka' newspaper. Preference will be given to those with camera. So many cameras are rotting in the showroom. If only I could have one, my job will be guaranteed. Namaskara sir. Please come Mr.Damodar. Have you got my camera? Cameras will be ready as soon as you give an order is given in our shop. Very good. Look here. Bring him his camera. Not now. I'll send someone called Vishwanath. You can give it to him. How will I identify him? He'll mention my name. He'll ask for the camera and... he'll ask for Bombay air tickets too. You give him these air tickets and tell him to leave the camera at my home. I have to go somewhere urgently. I'll leave. Namaskara. Namaskara. I'm Vishwanath. Damodar sent me. Will you give me the camera? How will I believe that you're Vishwanath? No need. I need only the air tickets urgently. That is enough. Give him. Take this. Thank you. Take this. You'll give the camera too? Please tell him that I would've delivered the camera to his home. And also please tell him that it'll be 15 days before I return from Bombay. I'll Leave. Namaskara. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Oh, so you're Vishwanath? Mr.Damodar had come to our shop. This is our shop. He said Vishwanath would come here to collect the air tickets. Take these. He took the camera. I don't have to make a trip to his home. You're going to Bombay? Happy Landing. Namaskara, Editor. Namaskara. Please sit down. Thank you. Your name? Varun Shourie. Oh. Do you have any experience reporting for the newspapers? Why wouldn't I have sir? I'm Arun Shourie's cousin. All the sensational news written in his name... ...are actually written by me. What does he know about reporting sir? You mean you write all the articles in his name? Why don't you write them in your name? That's all politics, sir. Some trade secrets can't be revealed just like that. But if you appoint me and later we become close... I can tell you some off the record secrets. Really? Then you're a very interesting person. Do you have camera? I do sir. I have captured countless scandals on this camera. This is my luckiest camera, sir. You give me an opportunity sir. Unearthing new scandals everyday and writing relentless articles on them... I will make your 'Vishala Karnataka' newspaper reach the whole of India sir. Very good, very good. You're appointed. Success! I can win this world with just my words. I can spin a top without a string. Would I let go the ones who get caught in my web? I can mesmerise and survive. I can win a free lunch. This is a ripe time for lies and schemes. I know the minds of crooked people. I can throw dust in their eyes. My bait awaits those who are stupid. Cheating begets cheating. Hatred begets hatred. I'll reveal the truth of your lives. I can win this world with just my words. I can spin a top without a string. Would I let go the ones who get caught in my web? Cheating is not my aim. I won't leave if you're asking for it. You won't get to see another smart one like me. I'm the only name for cheating. Intelligent is this Lambodhara. A smart man can thrive anywhere. I wait for my chance, jump on the opportunity... and snatch as much as I can. I can win this world with just my words. I can spin a top without a string. Would I let go the ones who get caught in my web? Come come. How's my camera working? How will it work? You didn't give camera to Vishwanath. You gave him only the air tickets and told him that I took the camera home. Who told you so? I gave him the camera myself. What man? I gave him the camera only when he asked for Bombay air tickets. But Vishwanath also wouldn't lie to me. Is this the person to whom you gave the camera? As I remember, this is not that person. You look. Definitely it's not him. But he told everything you said he'd say. Looks like we've been cheated. You don't worry. Come what may, I'll catch that thief. You're most lucky Mr.Varun Shourie. Today, there's a function at our proprietor's house. Lots of VIPs are coming. He wants photo coverage done. I've told him that I'll send you. Go and take some first class photos. Then you can become close to him. Thank you sir. Thank you very much. Namaskara, please come. I'm Varun Shourie. Oh! So, it's you. Nice to have seen you. Please come. But please forgive me. Why? It's not right to use you for my personal work. But our editor told me that you're a very good photographer and reporter. That's why I called you. It's my privilege sir. Thank you very much sir. It's late. Don't know what he'll say. Come man come. How can you come late like some VIP? Had trouble with the car. Anyway, welcome. I'll introduce you to a VVIP. Would you? You go inside. Sir. This is my brother. Nagesh. He owns a camera shop. Thank you. You know who he is? Arun Shourie's cousin Varun Shourie. He's newly appointed to my press. Hello sir. You scoundrel. I caught you now. At last I'm caught now. I must take the camera and throw him out. He may take the camera, should I make a run for it? No, not in front of my brother. I'll deal with him later. No, let me not run away. I'm caught anyway. Let's see what happens. Why do you stand so surprised? Are you dumbstruck that you met such a celebrity? Hello, Prithviraj. Oh, hello sir. Look here. I'm telling you nicely. Give me the camera and leave. Or else I'll tell my brother. He's short tempered. I'll make a scene by telling him. If you don't want to lose your honour, give me the camera. Ah, It's you? Sir. Sir. Sir, please stand at one place. I didn't get time to speak to you yesterday. So, I got your address from the editor and came straight to you. Please sir. Please sit down. And please listen to me peacefully. You too sit down boys. Who is this? Whats going on? He's a cheat. Sir, I've not come to cheat you. I came to explain my situation and ask for forgiveness. What is so bad about your situation? Poverty is very bad sir. I'm a photographer sir. I had a small studio. Because it was a small town, the business was average. I was managing somehow. I lost my mother while young sir. There was no woman in my home. That's why my father forcibly got me married at 16. After first year of marriage, Rajesh was born. After that Mahesh. Like they say poverty has many kids... After Mahesh, Abhilasha, Veeresh and later Kallesh and Mallesh. Why are crying boy? My boy? Are you hungry? Lie down. Like this, I had many kids. At 22, I was a father of 6 kids. Suddenly. God was angry at me. Bad times started you see. As soon as the last one Mallesh was born, his mother died right after. While we were already suffering with all these difficulties... there was another tragedy waiting. That studio which used to feed my family... was burnt down due to a short circuit. My father died in that fire right in front of my eyes. I wandered everywhere searching for a job to feed my children. I didn't get a job anywhere. Then in your brother's newspaper... I saw this ad for reporter preferably with a camera and came to your shop. I heard someone talking there. Instead of starving 6 children, I thought lying would be better. I mustered enough courage and told a lie to you. As soon as I lied to you... God seem to have gotten angry at me. He got me caught and you took away the camera. I have no other way to make a living. That's why, I have decided to poison myself and my children and die. But only I've asked for your forgiveness. Don't do it. Don't poison the children. I don't know in which previous lives we had poisoned the children, we have no children in this life. Now, if we are the cause for your children's death... that sin will stick to us for 7 more lives. You want the camera right? I'll get you the camera. You take care of your life. But don't poison the children. Children. I'll bring you some sweets. Please bring them quickly. Hey get up. They said they'll give us sweets. Go and have them. Don't be shy. How cute they are. Take this. Take this camera. Thank you sir. Take this money too. I can't see these children in torn clothes. Buy them new clothes and feed them. Sir. I won't forget your help in this life. Please sir, if you don't mind. Please madam stand with him. I'll take only one photo. I'll frame it and worship you in my home. Now smile. Smile. And then? He thinks he's very smart. He doesn't know I'm smarter than him. He was happy that he caught me. I had taken all the neighbours' children. I started weaving some tale and... that idiot believed everything and started crying. His wife... idiot too. Here I was running a train without tracks and she was crying hearing all that. At last. Those two fools gave the camera, gave money for children's clothes... and fed the very mouth that lied with sweets. Are there fools like this still in this world? There are. It's you sir. Who are these Lambodhara? The same fools? Yes, it's us. We are fools to still believe in dharma and karma. When did you come? We came while you were praising us. I had forgotten to give the flash with the camera. I got your address from 'Vishala Karnataka' newspaper and came here just to give it to you. What kind of people are you? When a man is boasting how he cheated someone... you people are laughing with him. Are you all humans? What are you looking at? Give me the camera. The money I gave? I spent it for the clothes. A lie even after all this. We should hand him over to police. No need for that. We've already been shamed in front of these people. Should those police too laugh at us? I'll have you fired from your job. What Lambodhara? Do you have my rent? Oh Mr. Janardhanayya, you should've come a bit early. You should've come 5 minutes before. I had pocket full of money. A poor Brahmin and his wife just left. They asked for help with their daughter's marriage. So, I gave everything I had. Look here. You're cheating me like this every month. Will you give me the rent or not? No, sir. Ok then. My people will come and throw you out. Be ready. So be it. What is this Lambodhara? Today all planets are against you? Yes. I seem to be having a bad time. I should go somewhere and take rest for 15 days. Can I give you an idea? Sure. Best thing would be to steal and go to jail. Free boarding. Free lodging. You'll get good rest. You'll get time to think about your next scheme. Who will respect me if I go to jail? I have a better idea myself. What is it? I'll go to hospital complaining about throat or stomach pain and get admitted there. Income is zero. If I mention that I'm an unemployed in the form... I'll get free lunch, bread, milk and banana. If one is a non-vegetarian, egg is also free. In addition you get to see beautiful nurses walking around you. What brain you have. If anyone wants to know how many ways there are to survive, they must come to you. That's alright but when did you get this hospital idea? This is an old idea. Very old. I used to take rest in hospitals before. If discharged from Victoria, go to Bowring. If discharged from Bowring, go to Victoria. Bowring - Victoria, Victoria - Bowring. You're a very thrilling personality. Am I not? But why did you leave that? A nurse fell him love with me there and started pestering me. I dumped this idea because of her. What if she bothers you now too? How can she now? She would've been transferred to somewhere else, right? Then your next programme is...? Why is the milk watery today? The cow drank more water today. That's why. Ayyo! Amma! Hi, Lambu dear! Lambu dear. By god's grace you're ill again. I was so worried that you may not get ill and come back here at all, you know? Didn't you get transferred somewhere else? Why Lambu dear? You are sad after seeing me. You know how much I love you? Whenever you came to the hospital... I have taken special care of you. You know? That's why I have got sick again for you. Is it? Yes. Thank you Lambu dear. Take this milk. For him, I'll serve the milk. Take this bread. Give me that. Lambu dear. Shall I feed you bread and milk? No. I'll eat them myself. When will the doctor come? He'll come in half an hour. Sister, doctor is calling you. I'll come. You go. Lambu dear. You should drink milk after it cools down and then take rest. I'll leave. OK. How are you? I'm OK sir. What's happening? My stomach's aching. Looks like Appendicitis. Get him to the operation theatre immediately. Are you a new doctor? Why? Are you scared? No. Not scared. I thought there will be Dr. Mantralaya or Dr. Dharmashala here. There's no doctor by that name here. It's not their names. But nick names I have for them. Dr. Mantralaya means Dr. Raghavendra. Dr. Dharmasthala means Dr. Manjunath. What's your name doctor? Dr. Thirupathi. You mean Dr. Venkatesh? No. Shrinivas. Oh, Dr, Shrinivas. How long do I have to stay after the operation? Some 15-20 days. 15-20 days... OK go ahead. Why do you ask? No, I might get bored after 15 days. Oh, I see. Why hasn't the surgeon come yet? Sorry everybody. You? Get up. What happened? Doctor, he isn't sick. It's all a ruse. Ruse? I know him very well. Makes something up and gets admitted into a government hospital. He stays as long as possible in one hospital. Once discharged, goes to another. This is his job. Why do you do all this? For food. Fruits, milk, bread are all provided free in hospitals, right? That's why this trick. Long ago, he got admitted into the hospital I was working. Only when I took him to operation theatre... ...I learnt about his tricks. This is the third time he's getting caught by me. My bad luck. Get up. Get out. Hey, go now. Hey, take the hospital clothes back. What a weird character. If operation had been done, I could've stayed and thought about future. Hi, Lambu dear. What are you doing? What's this? Dead body. Don't you have seriousness while moving the dead body? If I take every dead one seriously, I have to stop doing my job and cry all day. What's this Lambu dear? You're looking at that dead woman while I'm standing here. I was looking at her with pity. So young. What happened? Heart surgery. It was a failure. Shouldn't have happened at this young age. What's her name? Gowri. Isn't there anyone for her? No one. She's an orphan. Her friends had admitted her. Would come in the evening. Which ward was she in? Female ward. What's the bed number? You want that too? 14. 14. Ok then I'll leave sister. Lambu dear. I've told you many times not to call me sister. Oh sorry, I forgot. I'll leave my sexy Sarsu. Gowri. Gowri! My sister. You left your brother alone here? Gowri my sister. As a brother, I couldn't be with you in your last moments. How's she related to you? I'm crying sister. You couldn't understand? He's already overcome with grief. Why do you bother him? Does this all belong to Gowri? She had the habit of writing her diary daily. I had bought this saree for her last Deepavali. During new year celebrations, she was looking so beautiful in this you know? Gowri, without you... I won't live in this world. I'll also come. I'll leave. Please have this. This is how brotherly love must be. Mother Gowri. I'm taking this bag for my own sake. This is not theft. Because we both are orphans. If I leave this, someone else will take this. So, believing that this is your help to me, I'm taking this with me. If it is wrong, please forgive me. How much will you give sir? I'll give 75 for each. I'm in need. Please reconsider. No, no. It won't get a cent more than 75 rupees. Ok give me. GIve the sarees. What shall I give you sir? Give me a strong coffee. I write the diary as a hobby. I read it for self assessment. Gowri. Must have been a poetess. I carried an ambition to leave a permanent mark on this world. But what do I do? I was born into a poor family. Because a numerous weird incidents happened in my life... and because I wanted my name to be remembered, I've told all these incidents to an author. Even if I die in this heart surgery, at least, my name, my life, should be documented in a novel. That's the aim of this diary. This is very interesting. I might an idea too. Three prominent persons who came in my life. Anand Rao. Washington, USA. Madhusudan, 9th cross, C R Das road, Calcutta. Chandramouli, S/O Puranchandra Rao, G N Road, Amritsar, Punjab. All the three are not in Karnataka. My close friend, Chanchala. She was married? Her story is quite mysterious. Who's the novelist? [Novel author- Raja Chendoor] I'm happy to know that you're interested in her life, Lambodhar. But a director took that story to make a film. Who's that director? When you've come with so much enthusiasm, it won't be nice of me to say no. This is the script I've made out of Gowri's true story. Take this. But bring it back after you've read. Sure. Thank you. In a town, there was a beautiful girl, and her name was Gowri. Without her mother and in the clutches of her stepmother, she was growing up. Her beauty became a curse for this girl. The girl suffered like a flower in the summer heat. Death came for her father. Stepmother started showing her demonic face. Her beauty caught stepmother's evil eye. Stepmother conspired to force her into prostitution. Her beauty caught stepmother's evil eye. Stepmother conspired to force her into prostitution. She was a righteous woman. Suffered from all the injustice. She left her home. And became a bird without its nest. A friend showing compassion, gave shelter to Gowri. Because of the compassion shown by her friend, she got a job in an office. What can I say? The place she worked at, the boss was a womaniser. Anand Rao with his lustful eyes, Became a hawk for this bird. Gowri, Come in. Gowri, you didn't give an answer to my question. To which question? That...you will spend a night with me. I'm sorry sir. I'm not like that. Look, I don't care what kind of woman you are. There's no space for any woman who wouldn't fulfill my wish. That's all. Sir, please don't do so. I'm very poor sir. You may be poor in money. But in beauty... you're rich. Look Gowri. If you think a bit broadly... you can be the owner of all that belongs to this Anand Rao. You can enjoy the riches. You mean? I have no interest in my wife to whom my parents forcibly got me married. You have 4 children without being interested? Oh, forget that. It keeps happening if there's interest or not. But one will have his own desires and taste, right? Look Gowri, I've slept with all the woman in my office. But I don't just desire you, I love you too. If you agree, I'm ready to accept you as my wife. You, a father of 4 children will marry me? Why not? If you want, I'll divorce my wife. Just because you desire me, I can't let you abandon your wife and children. Then, spend a night with me. I'm mad after you. Sir, I'm not like what you think. So, you don't want to fulfill my desire. Then I wouldn't like you working in my office. Look Gowri. Day after tomorrow, My family and I are going to America. Probably I may settle in Washington. That means we have only one day for us. Tomorrow evening, if you fulfill my desire, your job is permanent. Otherwise, I'll dismiss you before I leave for America. Even if you agree and want to surrender to me later, I won't be there. Think about it. Poor girl. Why do you cry for such a small thing? These things are common today. Skin to skin, there's no sin, you know? What'll you lose if you spend a night with him? I'll lose the most important. My honour. You fool. These are old theories. But know this, the new age theory. We must enjoy everything there is before the marriage. You can be loyal to someone after that. We would be cheating the guys who trusts us while marrying. They can expect the purity in us only if they are, right? We won't have freedom after marriage. So, before that happens, we must enjoy how a man would enjoy in his life. Look, I can't do all that. Then lose the job. Why should I bother? Hey, when she's asking your advice as a friend, this is the advice you give? Your father is western and your mother, ultra modern. That's why women drinking, smoking and sleeping with other men is not such a big deal for you. But she's a traditional woman. You can't change her mindset. Give her some other advice. Hey Gowri, come here. OK sir. I agree to do what you asked. Really? I feel happy as if I've conquered this whole world. But one condition sir. What is it? You must come to the place I tell you. Only for one hour. OK Gowri, I'll agree to everything. I just want to make you mine. Where shall I come and when? Come in. Come inside. Please sit down. Come sit down. I was scared that you might change your mind at the last minute. Whenever I make a decision, there's no question of changing it. This house owner will come back by 10pm. Your job must get over before that. No one must know about this. Sure Gowri. I don't just lust you but I've real love for you. Pure love. Whatever, ultimately it ends in this, right? In fact... I placed you in my heart when I first saw you. 10 minutes have already gone by. If you keep on chatting like this, the calling bell would ring any minute. And you'll have to leave. You seem to be in hurry more than me. I think I've not closed the back door. I'll close that and come back? OK. Oh, the power is out. Let it go. Saved the trouble of switching the light off. Super, super. Oh Gowri darling, come, come. Slave to the pleasures, the fool Anand Rao... believed all that happened in the dark. Slave to the pleasures, the fool Anand Rao... believed all that happened in the dark. His lustful arrow missed the target. He didn't get this bird after all. This secret whom no one knows... was documented in this diary. And became an inspiration for this story. Thank you very much. I won't forget your help all my life. What's there in it? Look here. I got money and pleasure. Not bad. He's left some money too. Not just that. You know what else he said? He loves you very much. He said, if at all you get pregnant after today, you must not abort the baby. Because he has only girl children. If he gets a boy from you, he said he'll keep you with him. He has talked quite a lot then. There's more. After going to America, he'll write letters to you. You must report your health back to him. That's fine. But what were you doing all this while? If I talk, he'll know me by voice. So, I just kept saying hmm, aha and passed the time. Gowri's bad time did not end here. Fate had something else in store. Tragedy came in the name of a disease. Gowri's heart was failing. There's a problem in the heart. We need to perform bypass surgery as soon as possible. How much would it cost doctor? We need at least 60000 rupees. Can't we do anything without the surgery? This is very delicate. If we don't perform surgery in two months, there's danger to her life. OK doctor, we'll try. [Shri Shaila Charitable Organisation] To save best friend Gowri's life... her friends sought help from everywhere. They sent letters to everywhere seeking money. Excuse me. Where is Ms. Gowri staying here? That room. Excuse me. I wanted Ms. Gowri. It's me. Hello, my name is Chandramouli. The letter you sent seeking help reached our organisation. I came here to alk about that. Would you please come? Yes. Come Chanchala. Excuse me. This is a bit personal. There's no secrets between us. Moreover, she wrote that letter to you. Is it? Then it's OK. Please come. I'll help you with the money for the surgery. Many thanks sir. We were disappointed getting no help. God has sent you to us. But I want something in return. I'm expecting a favour from you. What is it sir? My father is Purananda Rao and mother, Vishalakshamma. Both of them are settled in Punjab. I'm looking after the business here. We are rich. How can we help rich people like you? See, I've no interest in marriage or children. Even then, my parents are forcing me to marry my uncle's daughter. So? There's only one way to escape from this marriage and my father. I'm going to tell him that I've loved and married a girl. So? What should we do? You must act like you're that girl. Don't be so terrified. Wait. Let's first hear him out. How do you mean? We should get a photo taken as a couple. I'll show that in my home. You don't worry. I'll give your photo and the negative back. That's all? If my father still doesn't agree to let me go... I'll arrange a fake wedding reception at Hotel Ashok. Everything will be like a real reception. But except for my parents, everyone else will know that it's a fake reception. You mean, I should act like your wife? That's only until my parents see us and go back. We can both part ways after that. What if your parents likes her and wants to take her home? That's not at all possible. Because there's terrorist problem there, they won't take her with them. Or if they come here? Who will look after the properties there? Once my uncle's daughter is married, I'll tell my father everything. What if your father causes any harm to me? See, I'll guarantee that nothing will happen to you by doing this. You please think about it and let me know. This is my phone number and address. I'll leave. Hey Gowri, you can agree to this blindfolded. No, this is very risky. What if something goes wrong? You fool. This profits you either way. Just agree to this. How's that? If this ends in just a drama... you'll have money for your surgery. If this gets serious and they accept you as daughter in law... he's handsome anyway. Why don't you...? Stop. I'm interested only in touch and go jobs. You get your photo taken with him. I'll take care of the rest. Do you see this Vishala? Look how he pays us back for all the love we gave him. I told you before that... He should stay with us. Did you listen to me? You said, 'there's terrorist problem, let him stay in home town.' What did he do there? He married some unknown girl and came here. Were we all dead to you? Didn't you try to get me married to your sister's daughter? That's why I married first and then informed you. Why? You should've informed us after the kid was born. That may happen soon too. Aren't you ashamed to say that? Why should I be ashamed? I have arranged for the reception on 21st in Bangalore. I've come to invite you and seek your blessings. If you come to Bangalore that day, call me. I'll tell you where to come. That's all, Goodbye. Without tying the knot or any rituals, Gowri became a bride in front of all people. She became a character in this drama of fake wedding. Hey, stop it. Is this a real wedding? Gowri, meet my friend Madhu. A big industrialist. He's settled in Calcutta. Hello. Namaskara. Hey, when you have found such a beauty, why this fake wedding? Marry her for real. If I had a chance. Hey, she's a heart patient. Let her be. Can you find another wife like that? Hey Madhu, your drink is ready. Come. My drink is waiting. Don't drink too much and lose control. Take care. I only know what I drink. I won't what happens next. You carry on. Hi Gowri. Hello sir. Hello. Wish your married life be sweet like milk and honey. That's not possible. Sir? How long do we wait? Your parents haven't come? I too don't understand why. My father is a very doubtful person. He should've come to at least check if this is real. One minute. I'll be back. OK. Hey Gowri. If you don't mind, I'll have some wine. Do whatever you want. I won't stop you. Thank you. Let's go. Hey Madhu, my parents haven't come yet. Whenever they come here, they stay at Sheshagiri Rao's house. Would you please check? That's all? You go stand there. OK Thank you. Who ordered wine? I did. Sorry friend. Your parents haven't come to Bangalore at all. All this is wasted. OK. I'll call Amritsar myself and come back. Hello? Hello. It's me Chandramouli. Is that daddy speaking? No. It's servant Bahadur Singh. Some terrorists barged into the house today and shot at master. Master is very hurt. He's in hospital. Mother is also with him. I'll leave immediately. Why sir? Why did you say so? I wantonly told him that. He arranges a reception without respecting our wishes and we must simply go there? Let that reception be damned. Gowri. Why are you so anxious? Terrorists have shot at my father. I'm leaving immediately. You and your friends can stay at the wedding suite this night. Or do whatever you feel like. I'll leave. Thought of something and something else happened. The fake wedding reception stopped unexpectedly. Chandramouli left to see his father... and took a flight with sadness. Fate had planned something else. Death took him away. Come let's all go to hostel. It's all over anyway. No. He said the wedding suite is booked in your name. We'll sleep there and go tomorrow. How often do we middle class people get to sleep in a 5000 rupees suite? I don't want that. I won't sleep in a honeymoon suite before marriage. You can sleep there if you want. What do you all say? We all will go to the hostel. You're all village idiots. You don't know how to enjoy life. I'll sleep there. Good night. Something weird happened here too. Fate brought in a third character here. The friend drank over his limit. He was searching for his room. Intoxicated, he entered the wedding suite and saw a woman lying there. Madhu was slave to the alcohol. This fool didn't understand what happened there. [Good night to Chandramouli and Gowri- Hotel Ashok] Gowri, I... in my intoxicated state... Gowri became a fruit untouched by any bird. But everybody thought they had the same fruit. Like a lotus untouched by the mud around it, Gowri remained a virgin throughout her life. And died as a virgin. Hey, Phaniramachandra. You wrote the story until now. I'll tell the rest of the story in my own way. What's this Lambodhara? You're doing pooja to some girl's photo? This girl might become a goddess who gives everything to me. That's why. How's that? Look, I'm telling all of this because you're close. You musn't tell anyone. Look Lambodhara, I'm only interested to know about your thrilling life. Have I caused any trouble to you before? Then listen. She's Gowri. An orphan like me. Day before yesterday, she died after heart surgery. I got this diary she had. I came to know after reading that diary. That three men had come in her life. You mean she's a... None of those three have even touched her. One in dark and another in intoxicated state have believed that they've slept with her. The third one had a fake wedding with her and died. But his parents still believe that she's their daughter in law. Then where are they now? One in Washington, another in Calcutta. The third one's parents live in Punjab. Because they're all so far away, I've planned something. What's that plan? There's boy born from Gowri now. But you said no one touched her? No, he's born in my imagination. And then that I'm raising that kid. So, I'll write a letter to all the three. What? Dear So & so, Because You/ Your son... ...had an affair with my sister Gowri... she became pregnant and has given birth to a boy. But because there were complications during delivery, she died after birth. Before she died, she called me and said, 'Brother, This is the boy's father. I'll give you their address. Please send a letter and inform them.' 'If they like let them come and take the child or else send him to an orphanage.' 'If they like the child but can't take the child fearing the society,' 'and if they agree to send you some money, brother,' 'please raise him like your own son.' Saying this she died. As a brother, I've been following my duties. So, I've decided to await your instructions from now on, and I'm waiting for your answer regarding the same. Gowri's brother, me. What if they want to come and take the child? I've written to then asking to inform me beforehand. If they come, I'll run away. What if they ask you to send that child to an orphanage? I'll shut up thinking my plan failed. But by luck, if they ask me to raise the child, and send the money every month... in the name of that unborn child... and counting all the money they send every month... I can live like a king, isn't it? What brain you have. If my luck strikes Ratnakar... I'll have 3000 rupees every month. It's time for the postal clearance. I'll leave. Leave oh, great being. Mother Gowri, may my plan become a success. This damned Lambodhara won't hear the bell. Lambodhara, Lambodhara. Will you pay the rent or should I throw you out? Why are yelling like a third class fellow? I'm a high class man now. I'm doing business in America, Calcutta and Amritsar. You were screaming for rent? Here it is. Not bad. Next month I'm vacating the house. Be ready with the advance amount. I can't stay in a pig sty like this. My letters would've reached by now. Gowri. You had a child from me? What a mistake I did. I should be punished for this. I'll take the responsibility of that child. But, I can't raise that child. I'm not married. I will. I will search and marry a woman who could raise him like her own. Till then, let Lambodhara take care of the child. I'll send the money he needs. Our grandson. Thank god, after Chandramouli died, I thought we were left with no heir. I'm happy that our bloodline is still alive. Let's go bring him here. Oh, how can we bring him here? There's a lot of terrorist problem here. A few days ago a school bus was bombed and all the children in that died. We can't bring him now. Then can we go there to see him? Oh, we too can't go out. I'll write a letter and ask Lambodhar to send a photo of the child. At last I have a boy child. Gowri. Don't worry. Just because you died, I won't let the child be sent to an orphanage. But what do I do? If I were in India, I would've visited him immediately. I'm stuck in this foreign country. Gowri. I'll write a letter to your brother now. I'll ask him to raise my child. I'll send him not 500, but a 1000 rupees every month. Do you see Ratnakar? My plan is successful. All the three goats have fallen into my trap. What have they written? All the 3 will send me money every month. So, to reinforce their trust in me, I'll write another letter telling them I've name the child 'Ganesha'. Why Ganesha? Look. That Goddess Gowri didn't carry Ganesha in womb. But still lord Ganesha is Gowri's son, right? Likewise our Gowri was born a virgin and died a virgin. But didn't I create a son for her? So, her son's name will be Ganesha. Lambodhara. What is it Puttammajji? There's a naming ceremony in our house for my grandson. You two must come have lunch with us. Sure. Are you video recording the ceremony? Now that is the fashion. Yes it is. Very good. Then I'll stand right next to the baby all day if you don't mind. Very good. I'll leave. OK. I smell a scheme in this? In what? That you asked if they're recording. I'll make three copies of the same video. I'll write saying that I've conducted naming ceremony. I'll send the 3 cassettes to all the 3. Then the fools will think... How's your child? He's very cute. M. Ganesha. You've named him M. Ganesha? M means... Madhusudan. Madhu's son, Ganesha. Beautiful. Beautiful. My sweet child. Your son, A. Ganesha. Ah? A. Ganesh. Meaning... Anand Rao Ganesh. How's your grandson? The child looks like little Krishna. Doesn't he? Yes, but the name Ganesha is not good. This time while sending the amount, ask him to change the name to Chandramouli. I'll write it now. Why not? Why I'll name him even Suryamouli if you like. What will I lose? How does it matter what we call an unborn child? I must keep getting my money. That's all I need. Your child is smiling... and playing in the cradle. Your child is smiling... and playing in the cradle. With the name Ganesha, this son of Gowri came to earth. Your child is smiling... and playing in the cradle. Like Gopi's son Krishna, his face is beautiful. With the blessings of family deities, this bond has developed. I got him triple antigen shots in his third month. Poor child. How hurt he must have been. I also got him Polio drops. The baby must have cried all night long. I bathe him myself. I'll sing the lullaby and send him to sleep. I've dedicated my life to raise your child. You're not man. A god. Your child is smiling... he's taking baby steps. With the name Ganesha, this son of Gowri came to earth. [Gowri Garments] Attracted to the lamp, he touched the fire, and burnt his fingers today. He plays in water everyday. He rolls on the ground plays with mud. I carry him on my back and play with him. Oh, I don't have that pleasure. I show him your photo whenever he asks for you. Correct. I'm his father, right? I offered my service at Thirupathi. Got his first haircut there. I called all the ladies from the neighbourhood and did the ceremony. He has completed everything properly. Your child is smiling... and taking baby steps. With the name Ganesha, this son of Gowri came to earth. Your child is smiling... and taking baby steps. Holding a slate and breaking the chalk, he writes and mumbles. He writes the moon. He draws it and makes corrections too. He cries when I teach ABCD. But don't hit him because of that. He smiles when he hears A, Aa, I, Ee [Kannada Alphabet] Very good. He's like me, Kannada medium student. This naughty is Kannada lover. Knows Kannada multiplication tables by heart. Given a Kannada flag in his hand, he'll sing like a servant of Kannada. He'll definitely become a Kannada activist. Your child is smiling... He kisses if lifted in arms. With the name Ganesha, this son of Gowri came to earth. This is latest design saree madam. It has come to market only today. What's the price? Sir, what's the price of this? 175. 125. How much? 125 madam. He seems to be deaf. He says 125 when his master is saying 175. We'll save 50 rupees. Let's give the money to him and leave. Pack this saree. Give him exactly 125. We'll give it to this boy and leave. OK. Take this madam. Take this boy. [Counting] Guru. They fell for our trap. See how they're running away. They gave 125 for a saree worth 75? Good. Take this. Keep working like this. Hello? It's me. It's me Sarsu speaking here. What is it Sarsu? You've got a letter. From whom? It's from Anand Rao. Did you read it? Yes. Anand Rao is coming tomorrow to see his son Ganesha. He has asked you to bring the boy to the airport. Hello, hello. Why aren't you speaking? That... I'll come home. Sarsu... Sarsu... Give me that letter. Who's this Anand Rao and who's this Ganesha? Why should you take Ganesha to airport? You won't understand that. He says you've been raising his son? Whom are you raising? Ganesha. Who's he? Anand Rao's son. Who's Anand Rao? Ganesha's father. But why are you raising when he has his father? For Gowri. Who's Gowri? Ganesha's mother. Who's Ganesha? Gowri's son. But who's Gowri? I told you. Ganesha's mother. Oh, you mean Anand Rao and Gowri are husband and wife? No, no. Then? Anand Rao and Gowri are not husband and wife. But Ganesha is son to both. How's this possible? Oh, did they have an affair? Gowri is not like that. You're confusing me. Whatever it may be. Where is that Ganesha now? I'll tell you when I get hold of him. You don't even know where he is? I found him. Where? [Divyajyoti Orphanage, Bangalore] Please come Mr.Lambodhar. The cheque hasn't been prepared yet for the clothes you supplied. No, I didn't come for that. Then? I wanted a small boy. Oh, please come sit down. Is it because you haven't had a child for so many years? I haven't come for adoption. Then why do you need a boy? I'm stuck in a problem. One of my relatives had left their boy with me and went abroad. Now he's coming back after 5 years. During this time, their child fell ill and died. He's a heart patient. I didn't tell him fearing what may happen to him. He'll be here for a while. While he's here... I thought of showing one of the boys in your orphanage as his son. What if they want too take him with them? Don't worry. If such a thing happens, he will be adopted as per your orphanage rules. That boy will have a shelter and a heart patient will also be saved. Please take this. No, no. That's alright. Keep it. Intention is good. But I wouldn't have to face any problems, right? Not at all. If you want I'll sign a guarantee letter. Then it's OK. I'll show you all the smart kids. You take whomever you want. These are the smart kids in our orphanage. You can choose from them. Will you adopt us uncle? Look children. I'll ask some questions. Whoever gives the correct answer... I will take him with me. Ask us uncle. You'll put out an 8 yard saree to dry. It takes 5 minutes for a yard of saree to dry. Then how long will it take for the 8 yard saree to dry? 40 minutes. Wrong. Only 5 minutes. Who's this boy? His name is Ganesha. He's from here. Naughty and lies very much. Is it? I want someone like him. His name and character is most suited for me. Come boy. You see, you'll have to suffer. He's very dangerous. No problem. I want someone like him. Children,you can all go and play. Ganesha. Can I ask you a question? Why one? Ask me hundred. OK. Imagine that you want to get a haircut like Amitabh Bacchan. You'll go in search of a barber. There'll be two salons. One barber's hairstyle will be like Amitabh Bacchan. Another's hairstyle will be very bad. Like our master's? I'll slap you you silly boy. Where will you get your haircut? The one with the bad hairstyle. Why? Would the one with the Amitabh's hairstyle cut his own hair? No. So, someone must have given him that nice haircut. It must be the one with the bad hairsyle, right? Good. Patting me on the back is not enough. You must earn my praise. Is it? OK. What should I do? Now, I'll ask a question. will you answer? OK ask. When do elephants have eight legs? Elephants and eight legs? When do they have? When two elephants stand next to each other. You're very smart. Have you acted in plays? Who wants theatre? That's old. I want to shine in films. Cinema? You mean you know some acting then? Who should I mimic? Dr. Rajkumar? [Singing a song from Rajkumar's film] Shall I mimic Vishnuvardhan? Yes. [Singing a song from Vishnuvardhan's film] Shall I do Ambareesh's? Do it. [Singing a song from Ambaresh's film] Shall I do yours? No, no. That's enough. The acting you need to do is completely different. I'll explain when we get home. I'll take him with me sir. Sarsu. I'm here. Ah, you're here. See, I found Ganesha. Where did you find him? Where was he until now? More important than that, doesn't matter who asks... you have to tell them that he is with us since his birth. Please bring us some coffee. Come sit down. Sir, will you tell me what is my role tomorrow? I have to think about that role. Aha, you think you're a big actor? Wants to think about role... Look if you insult me like this, I'll go back to orphanage. Hey, don't do that. No, no. I'll explain. Tomorrow morning at 10, someone called Anand Rao will come from America. You have to act like his son. I'll show you how. You need not show me the acting. You explain the scene. I'll manage the acting part. You son of a... No not you. Slip of the tongue. I'll take you to airport tomorrow. I'll show him to you. As soon as you see him, you should run and embrace him calling him daddy. Did you get it? OK, OK. Shall I show you once? Yes show me. Now, you're my daddy. Oh, he's your dad, I'm your uncle. I know. But you act like you're the daddy and I'll act like I'm the son. Oh, OK. Stand there. You want slow motion or fast? Oh, you have that too? Then what? Haven't you seen films? Slow motion means... [Calling 'Daddy' in slow motion] Now fast motion is like... Shall I come? Yes. Daddy. Which one shall I do? The first or the second? Do the second one, that's enough. Come quickly. How long will you take? Wait a second. My father is coming from a foreign country. Shouldn't I dress accordingly? You're acting too much. Remove your hand. Coat will get dirty. If you keep talking like this, I'll go back to orphanage. Hey, until now, I was controlling others. Now, you are controlling me? Anyway, come now. OK, let's go. How long will you take? Shouldn't I take this? Sir, you've a letter. The plane will have come and gone by the time you read that letter. Correct we can read it there, right? Let's go. There's an announcement. The plane from Delhi IC403... will be delayed by 30 minutes. We regret the inconvenience caused. Thank god. It's 30 minutes late. Sit down. I can breathe now. I will read this letter before he lands. 'Dear Lambodhar.' 'I'm coming to see my son on 10th by Calcutta flight.' 'Please bring my son M. Ganesha to the airport. Yours faithfully, Madhusudan.' Oh my god. Should he have come today itself? Excuse me. Yes? When is the Calcutta flight arriving? At 12. That means there's 2 hour difference between the two. The plane has landed. Let's go. Ganesha, you see that man wearing brown suit? He's Anand Rao. Will you go? Start now. Daddy. My dear A. Ganesh. I'm Lambodhar. Hello Mr. Lambodhar. I'm Anand Rao. I know, I know. Daddy, seeing only your photo everyday, I was worried if I'll ever see you in person. That's why my boy. I came flying to see only you. Nose is just like mine. Lips are just like mine. In total you're just like me. Mr. Lambodhar, I don't know how to thank you. You gave me a male child to me who has only female children. I only did my duty. You're ecstatic seeing your son for the first time. Why don't we go home, relax and then talk? No, I'm sorry Mr.Lambodhar. I won't come home. I'll go to a hotel. Which hotel? [Hotel Ashok] Sir, your room number is 102. Thank you. Come on sonny. Yes daddy. Take this. Thank you sir. Come on sonny. Sonny, sonny, sonny. What's your full name? A. Ganesh. What is A in A. Ganesh? Anand Rao Ganesh. Very good, very good. Which class are you studying in? 1st standard. Which school? Great Britain English School. But you don't talk English at all? He loves Kannada very much. Super, super. Show your hand. Mr. Anand Rao. I have to leave. What's so urgent? My wife, Ganesha and I were leaving for airport. Suddenly a mad dog came and bit her. If I had stopped for her treatment then, we couldn't have to come to the airport. My wife's treatment is not as important as your visit after so many years. So, I left her there and came to airport. Oh, I'm so sorry. You please go and come. Thank you. But I need to take Ganesha too. You have to take Ganesha too? It's not even been 10 minutes and you're separating the father and son. That is... Ganesha... that... Daddy. I have to go. Why? Only I know the dog that bit auntie. Shouldn't I be able to show it to the doctor? Correct. I haven't seen its colour, tail or face. Is it? Then you can take him. Come back soon my dear. Come back soon. We'll leave. Ah, my dear. How crafty you are with the lies. You lie much better than me. How valuable liars are these days. Look, before you lie, inform me first. I'll adapt. But don't lie suddenly and put me in a fix. Sorry boss. From now on, I'll inform you first and then lie. Now let's go. Uncle, why have we come to the airport again? Like that man who came earlier... another will come now. You have to run and kiss him calling him daddy. I have two daddys? For now only two. Do you see? My teacher always used to say... when god gives you, he gives plenty. When I was in orphanage, I didn't have a single father.. Now, I have two daddys. How is it? Plane has landed. Let's go. You see that man wearing blue suit? Yes. He's your second daddy. Go, go. Shall I call him second daddy? If you act smart, I'll beat you. I'll go back if you hit me. Don't scare me like that at every step. Go now. Now that's the way you behave. Please go now. I'll go in slow motion this time. Go however you want. I'm Lambodhar. Very nice to meet you. Come. Daddy, seeing your photo everyday until now, I was so desperate to see you in person, you know? I was worried if I'll ever see you. That's why I came flying like a bird as soon as I got time. Daddy, will you take me with you? I will take you. But wait for some time. Why? Isn't Lambodhar looking after you well? He is, daddy. He looks after me very well. But still there's a difference between the love of parents and others'. Isn't there? You son of a... He just looks small. But hot and spicy like chikkaballapur chilli. Why are you looking at me like that daddy? Eyes are just like mine. Nose is just like mine. Lips look like they're cloned. Come, my dear come. Mr. Lambodhar, won't you get down? You are staying at Hotel Ashok too? Why? Is someone else staying here? No, not like that. Everyone who comes to Bangalore stays at Ashok Hotel. Because it's 5 star, right? Yes. Let's go in. Hello. Good afternoon sir. I'm Madhusudan from Calcutta. Your room number is 104 sir. What is it uncle? One daddy in 102 and the other in 104. How do we manage? Please take the key. Thank you. Come. Why are you standing there Mr. Lambodhar? Hey, Ganesh come. Yes. Lambodhar, why were you standing there and why did you come running like this? Poor boy's coat was stuck there. Sir, luggage has been kept inside. Thank you. Thank you sir. Come boy. Please come. Come my dear. My dearest. What do they call you in school? M. Ganesh. M. Ganesh? Father's name is Madhusudan and my name is Ganesh. My dear good boy. For my dear little Ganesha, you know what I've brought? A train. I always run the trains.[running trains means to tell lies] A monkey to play with. Why all that when you're there? No, I mean you've come after so many years. You can play with him. Why need all those things? Correct. You're correct Mr. Lambodhar. What you say is 100% correct. I'll play with him. One minute. Excuse me. Daddy in 102 will be waiting for us. We have to find an excuse to leave from here. Do whatever you want. This daddy is better than him. I'll stay here. I'll kick you. If you kick me, I'll go back. Because everything is in your hands, you are playing with me as you please? Mr. Madhusudan, Ganesha and I will go home and come back in half an hour. What is this Lambodhar? I'm seeing him after so many years. Not even 10 minutes have passed and you want to take him. I haven't turned off the gas stove at home. I fear something might happen. You can go for that. Why do you need Ganesh? Ye. I mean... Gas... Cylinder... Daddy, it can't be turned off if I don't go. Why is that? We only have one key for our house. When auntie locks the door, she puts the key in the ventilator. Both uncle's or auntie's hand can't be put inside that. So, uncle lifts me up like this. I'll put my little hand inside and get him the key. We can't trust even our neighbours you see. You're impossible. Please go. But please come back soon. Definitely. We understand your emotion. Ganesha, let's go. Daddy. Hello, sonny. Come, come. Did you get the injection? Injection? Ah, yes. We got her the injection. Auntie cried when she got the shot. I too cried. Poor thing. Wait a second. Hello, room service? I'm speaking from 102. Please send 3 meals. South indian. Thank you. Which rank do you get in your class? I'm your son daddy. I always come first. Good. Who's your best friend? You. Me? Your friend? How? My teacher says there's no better friend than one's father. Sir, meals ready. Ganesha, lunch has arrived. Let's wash our hands. You wouldn't have eaten food like this before. Enjoy it. Yes, I will enjoy it. Come on my sonny. Now I'll feed you the food. I'll wash my hands. Daddy order an ice cream. Bearer, get him an ice cream. Yes sir. I'll come back. Ganesha, we have to find an excuse to leave after lunch. Otherwise daddy in 104 will be screaming. Don't worry uncle. I'll take care from here. Come on sonny. Shall I feed you? Daddy I've had enough curd rice. I'll have ice cream now. OK. Daddy, I'll ask you a smart question. Will you answer? Go ahead, ask. What is smaller than an ant? A thing smaller than ant... What is it? I don't know. You tell. Food in the ant's mouth. You haven't his smartness enough. He keeps asking me like this too. Like you, he too fails to answer any question. Ungrateful fellow. He insults me even when I praise him. Daddy, can I ask you another question? Who in our country has the most number of children? One with most number of children...? I don't know. You tell. Gandhiji. Why? Because he's the father of the nation. Mr. Lambodhar, you have bringing up my child very well. I'm very happy. Uncle what's the time? 1:30pm. Oh uncle. We have to go. Where? Oh uncle, you keep forgetting everything like this. Didn't I tell you that my teacher Mary is having a surgery? Oh yes. I forgot. Is she? What operation? Stomach operation. We were instructed to come and pray at the hospital. Weren't we? Yes, yes Mr. Anand Rao. Wash your hands and come quickly. Oh, what an unlucky day to come. I'm not able to pass even half an hour with him. Anyway... Mr. Lambodhar, you're going to a hospital. Please buy some fruits. Sure. Thank you. My daddy is so good. I'll come back soon daddy. My precious. Works like a computer when lying. This is what I've to do when I'm with people like you. Hello Mister. GIve me that 100 rupees. Why? Because it's mine. Yes, yours. Your father's. Yes, it's my father's. Who's your father? Is he not my father? Then let me go back to... I didn't say like that. Then what did you mean? Didn't I get that because I lied about my teacher? So, it's mine. Give it to me. You've become wise. But how long will you do this? Only 3 days. Take this. Hello, let's take 50-50. Come. OK. Oh, Mr. Lambodhar. Please come. I was desperate for my boy. Hello, room service? Send 3 meals urgently to 104. Lunch? Why are you so scared of meals? No excuses. I have this golden opportunity of having a meal with my son. How can I lose it? You're right daddy. I too want to have lunch with you. Very good my son. This is the love a son must havefor his father. Come Lambodhar. Please sit down. I'll feed my son with my own hands. I'll wash my hands and be back. What's this sir? You'll have this too? To keep your mouth shut. My dear. Sit down. Daddy, I won't have much. I can't eat too much. You've grown so lean because of your shyness. These guys aren't shy. They just now ate like hungry cows in that room. You want ice cream too? Get lost. I'm suffering here. You look like that when somebody's eating? Your evil eye will harm them. That is right. If you eat like this, why just evil eye, even the stomach will burst. What is this M. Ganesha? Is there where you vomit? It's Ok. He's only a child. Hey, what are you looking at? The child has vomited because of your evil eye. Go clean it. These people eat at 2-3 places and vomit. But I have to clean it up. Quick. Come, I'll wash your face. No, no. I'll wash. It's OK. No, no. I'll wash his face. Come boy. Are you alright? He loves the kid so much. Ganesha, if we are at the same place together, it'll be a problem. So, when you're here, I'll be there. When you're there, I'll be here. But what will we tell him now to escape from here? I'll manage that. M. Ganesha, now go play in the lift. Playing in the lift? Kids like going up and down in the lifts. Don't you? We don't have lift in our home. He can play until you're staying here. Go play for half an hour and come back. Thank you daddy. Go now. Good boy. Daddy. Oh, my boy. You came back. Did your teacher undergo surgery? It's still going on. We have to go again at 6. You have to go again at 6? This is quite a problem. Where is your Lambodhar uncle? He said he'll come in half an hour and asked me to be with you. Is it? Now, we two can play and spend time alone. You see Mr. Lambodhar. God gave me the right punishment for all my sins. What are you saying Mr. Madhusudan? Yes Lambodhar. That day... in my intoxicated state... I slept with Gowri in the wedding suite. I went back to Calcutta because I couldn't face her. I wrote a letter asking for forgiveness. I may have run away. But god didn't leave me alone. Gowri gave birth to a child. Taking full responsibility, I should've raised that child. Even then, I didn't do my duty and burdened you. That's why, god has given me a punishment that only I can experience. What punishment? Lambodhar, I have liver cancer. Is it? Oh god. Until now Ganesha didn't have only his mother. Now he has lost his father too, Mr. Madhusudan. What are you talking Mr. Lambodhar? I'm not dead. Yes. You must not die sir. But this cancer is also very deadly. That wouldn't let you live. I'm come here because of that uncertainty. I undergoing surgery next week. I'll live or die. I don't know. So, I've seen all my relatives. He was the last one. So, I came to see him. If I die, he inherits all my wealth. I have written everything in his name. May this fellow die soon. What are you thinking Lambodhar? I'll leave something for you too. No, I wasn't thinking about it Mr. Madhusudan. I was praying for something else. You wish good for others. So, god will listen to your prayers. Please bring my son back. Let him come and play with me too. I'll bring him, but don't tell all these things to him. Ganesha, lift is empty. Go and play if you want. Lift? Why? Daddy, I like going up and down in the lift. That's why. OK. Go play for half an hour and come back. A. Ganesh is completely like me. He's your son, isn't he? Yes. Daddy, I'll ask you question. Will you answer? Crows sit on all statues in our country. But they won't sit on Gandhi's statue. Why? Hmm, Why...? Ah, they respect him for getting our country its independence. Oh you're an idiot. Do crows read the history books? Oh, yes. Then why? You lost? I lost the day a brilliant boy like you was born. Tell me why. Gandhi has a stick in his hand, right? So, they fear that. I'll ask another? OK. When Rajiv Gandhi bathes, this hand won't get wet. How's that possible? Hmm, how? Ah, He'll have lifted his hand. No, it'll be down. It'll be down? Ah, he'll wrapped plastic around the hand. Does he have a broken arm to wrap plastic around it? I don't know. You tell. You lost? Yes, I lost. When Rajiv Gandhi bathes, how'll this hand be wet? Isn't this my hand? You're impossible. I'll ask another? No, that's enough. You are making me a fool by asking these questions. You already are a fool, daddy. You'll become again. Shall I ask one more? What is taken in light but created in dark? What is created in dark? Photo. Shall we go and get a picture taken? Oh my god. Mr. Lambodhar. It's been quite a while since he went to play. What if he gets stuck in the middle? Please bring him back. OK. I'll get him. Where did they go now? I don't know what misfortune awaits me. Chandramouli. Chandru dear. Chandramouli. Hey who are you? Why are you barging in like this? Where is our Chandru? Chandru? Which Chandru? Our Mouli. You see, there's no Mouli or Moole[bone] here. Who are you? Chandramouli's grandparents. But who's Chandramouli? Our Grandson. Arey, why would your grandson be here? This is Lambodhar's house? Yes. Then don't play around. Please call him. We're desperate to meet him. Are you mad or what? You come into my house and ask for Chandramouli. Where will I bring him from? Are you joking? Who are you? She must be the maid. Hey old woman. You come to my house and call me a house maid? I'm the owner of this house. Lambodhar's wife. Why didn't you tell us before? But you say that you don't know Chandramouli? I can tell you if I know any. I'm talking about the kid Lambodhar's raising. Chandramouli's son Chandramouli. You're really mad. Chandramouli's son Chandramouli. How's that possible? She must be crazy. Why bother with her? That's right. Where's Lambodhar? Somebody called Anand Rao. A crazy man like you had written a letter. That he wanted Lambodhar to bring a boy to the airport. Then later he got hold of a boy and has taken him there. Is it? Vishalakshi, there's something fishy in this. We shall not leave until Lambodhara comes back. Sit down. Where were you until now? I had taken him out. Oh, then it's OK. I've had Ganesha with me for so many years. I can't live without even for a minute. My heart keeps pounding until he returns. Of course, that is sentiment. How will I manage if you keep spending so much time with each man? While you were with him, 102 daddy is chanting your name there. You're only thinking about this one point. Have you thought about another thing? What is it? With whom shall I sleep tonight? If both ask for me, what will I do? Oh yes. We shall work out something. Come. Hey Ganesha. Why are going to that room? Oh this isn't our room. Oh god. Uncle 102 is there. Oh you're silly. You're going into other's room. All rooms look the same in this hotel. Couldn't recognise. You're right. Just like my son and I are. When you two are enjoying, why bother you? I'll come back after some time. OK, come on sonny. Come Lambodhar. Where is my son M. Ganesh? He's playing in the lift. He's crazy about these lifts, huh? Mr. Madhusudan. I wanted to ask you something. Yes. According to my sister, you have a habit of drinking at night. It would be good if you didn't drink tonight. That's not at all possible Mr. Lambodhar. I can live without anything. But I can't live without it. I have raised Ganesha with discipline and good habits. I have told him that smoking and drinking are bad habits. And those who do that are bad people. If he sees you smoking or drinking, he might get scared and not come near you at all. So... Yes you're correct Mr. Lambodhar. Whatever bad things we do... we must not do it in front of children. It'll have an effect on them. So, you... take Ganesha with you during night. And bring him here during day. I would if you don't mind. Not at all. Hello. Yes, Anand Rao here. It's me, receptionist Rita. Oh Rita. How did you know I was here? Wouldn't a hotel receptionist know who are staying in the hotel? You are alone or with company? No, no. I don't want any company tonight. When did you become an ascetic? Nothing like that. That is... No excuses. Vishwamitras like you cannot escape until there are Menakas like us. My work finishes at 8:30. I'll come to your room at 8:45, OK? OK. Mr. Anand Rao. I'm going home. You can keep Ganesha with you and listen to his sweet voice all night. No, no. No. He's used to sleeping with you. He may feel uncomfortable sleeping with others. No, Ganesha shall adjust. It's not like that Mr. Lambodhar. My business partners are coming tonight. Oh, business partners. So, if you don't mind. Keep him with you tonight. Bring him here in the morning. As you please sir. Ganesha Shall we leave? Come. Thank god. You finally came. I thought you'd stay with Anand Rao all night. Why are upset today? Whose car is this? Two bufoons have come into our house. Purnananda Rao and Vishalakshamma. They too have come today? They haven't just come. They've been eating my head all day long asking for Chandramouli. So what did you tell them? I told them this is not an orphanage to provide Ganesha and Chandramouli to anybody who comes asking. You mean you've told them everything. I thought they'll go then. But they didn't. Oh god. What happened? Sarsu, you want me to live longer, right? Yes. You want this marriage life to be long, right? Yes. Then do me a favour. Don't come into the house for half an hour. Please do not come. Is that all? I have married after so many difficulties. Why half hour? I can sleep at the gate all night long if you want. Wow, Ahalya, Tara, Sita and Mandodari are nothing in front you and your devotion to your husband. Sarsu, go and have a chat with that Gangu for some time. Why do you have to stand at the gate? Ok then, I'll leave. Bye. Ganesha, I need another help from you. What is this new problem? There's an old couple sitting inside. You have to hug and call them grandpa and grandma. I have grandparents too? Whose parents are they? Anand Rao's or Madhusudan's? Neither. They are Chandramouli's parents. Chandramouli? What's this new name? Chandramouli is your father. I have another father? Yes. He has come here too? He isn't alive to come. He has been dead for a long time. Poor fellow. Now I have one dead daddy, and two living ones. With that, the grandparents. Totally I'm doing a triple role like in the film Shankarguru, huh? My name is Ganesha here too? No, here your name is Chandramouli. Ok. The same acting I did at the airport. But I should call them grandpa and grandma, right? Yes, but there's another point here. What's that? Your auntie has told them everything. Now that has to become all lies right? We'll make auntie crazy. Ok, come. Lambodhar has come. Namaskara. Namaskara. I'm Purananda Rao and my wife Vishalakshi. Namaskara. Namaskara. Why are you sitting here? Come inside. Please come. When did you come? This afternoon. Please sit down. Chandramouli, these are your grandparents. Come here dear. Come. No, I won't. I'm angry with you. Look there. He looks exactly like our son Chandramouli when he's angry. Yes. Why are you angry? You haven't come to take me these many years. What do to dear? We are living in far away Punjab. There's terrorrist problem everyday. What if something happens to our sweet boy? That's why we didn't come. Come dear. No, I won't. Go dear. Don't you keep asking for your grandparents in sleep? Does he? Yes. Poor boy. Whenever he sees old people, he asks if his grandparents are like them. You love us so much? Oh, come here my sweet boy. Only I love you. You don't love me at all. If we don't love you, would we have come from so far just to see you? Come on smile. Come on smile my sweet... Nose is just like our Chandramouli. Look at the ears. They're wide just like Chandramouli's. Grandpa, auntie didn't hit you, did she? She probably would've if we had lingered here. Why do you ask? Auntie is a bit crazy. She's like that since the day got bit by a mad dog. Is she? But she talks all normal? She'll be normal. She does all the cooking and everything well. But when asked to serve, she puts it on our head. She keeps calling me with different names. She calls him Ganesha or Subbu. When he doesn't answer, she beats him. Poor woman. You should've consulted a doctor. We consulted, grandpa. We did. She was given injection, shock treatment and everything. Nothing worked. Grandpa, would you take me with you? We'll take you. But not now. As soon as we come here and settle down, we'll take you. Is it OK? Why don't you stay at our house until you're here? Why not? What if his wife goes nuts and hit us? Yes, you're right. Mr. Lambodhar. Why do you take trouble? We've already booked a room in a hotel. We'll have Chandramouli with us there. OK. Which hotel? Hotel Ashok. Purnananda Rao. Sir your room number is 106. Arey, Lambodhar, what happened? It's 5 star hotel right? Mosaic floor is a bit too smooth. I slipped. Give me the key. Why are you worried uncle? Then what? All the planets are in the same place, 102, 104 and 106. Don't worry uncle. I'm there. Anyway we have this lift game to play. I'll manage somehow. See what happens tomorrow. Daddy, daddy,daddy... You and I are a pair. My dear daddy, I love you. Daddy, daddy, daddy. You and I are a pair. My dear daddy, I love you. My dear daddy, I like you. Grandpa, I'll go elephant safari on your back. I'm the Mysore Raja and you're my ride. Grandpa, I'll go elephant safari on your back. I'm the Mysore Raja and you're my ride. We'll organise Dasara and have a durbar. We'll go on a procession in a jumbo ride. Choo choo train has come. We'll all get on it. We'll see Bombay and come back. We'll go to studio and get a picture taken. We'll go to park and play hide and seek. And pass time playing in the park. Grandma [Ajji], Banana fritters [bajji], Rub [Ujji] your cheek to my cheek, I love you. Grandpa [Taata], Oh you glutton [tindi pota], Eat this chow-chow bath, I love you. My dear grandpa, I like you. Come here daddy. Come sit down. Tie this around your eyes. Find out where I am now. Daddy. Not there, come here. To jolly, to pass time, let's play I spy. Count 1,2 ...100. I'll hide and you count. And find me out, daddy. Daddy, daddy, daddy, You and I are a pair. My dear daddy, I love you. Daddy, daddy, daddy, You and I are a pair. My dear daddy, I love you. My dear daddy, I like you. May I help you? Thank you. Your good name please. I'm Anand Rao. I'm Madhusudan. Nice meeting you. Pleasure is mine. Are you staying here? Yes, yes. I'm in 104. Are you? I'm in 102. Are you here on business? No,no. I've come from Calcutta to see my son. Is it? I too have come to see my son from Washington. How nice. Is he studying here? Yes. In Great Britain English School. My son is also goes there. Is it? My son is in 1st standard. Oh, my son too is in 1st standard. Your son's name? A. Ganesh. Oh, my son's name is M. Ganesh. Both sons' name are same but initials are different. They may be close friends. Maybe. Anyhow, we've become friends now. Yes, you're right. You must meet my son once. You too must meet my son. Such a lovely boy. Ok, then. When will you introduce me to your son? When? I'm going back to Calcutta tomorrow by 12:30 flight. He has this damned school inspection till 12. When will I introduce you? It's the same with my son. I'm leaving by 1:30 flight. It'll be 12:30 by the time he comes here. You too won't be here. OK. We shall meet when time permits. Excuse me sir. You have a phone call. Phone? I'll attend the phone. I'll in bar. If you get time... Ok, OK. Come. Please sit down there. There. Come. Grandpa. What is it child? Grandma. What is it boy? I want an ice cream. You want an ice cream? Our Chandramouli was also just like him, right? He used to pester me for ice cream. My gold. My gold nugget. Thank you. Take this. Hey Madhu. You know Madhu? Do I know him? He's my son's close friend. Hey, why are you sitting there. Come here. What Madhu? How are you? Sit down. He's our grandson. Hi, uncle. What are you looking at? He's our Chandramouli's son. Isn't he just like him? Mr. Lambodhar, I want to talk to you. Sure. Would you come aside? Excuse me. Two minutes. Come back soon. What is this? What sir? They're calling my son their grandson in front of me. It pains me so much. It pains me 10 times more, Mr. Madhusudan. But to keep my family's prestige intact, I have to do this drama. Drama, why? What else should I do? They don't know that the marriage between Gowri and Chandramouli was fake. They believe the child is born of Gowri and Chandramouli. So, they keep asking me for the child. Why don't you tell them directly that it's not theirs? What shall I tell if they ask who it belongs to? Should I say, when Gowri was sleeping in the wedding suite, Your son's friend Madhusudan came and raped her and the child is born of that rape? Should I tell that? Why are you silent now? Please tell me sir. To protect my honour, your honour, my sister's honour and my family's honour, and to console those old couple hearts, I'm doing all this. That poor boy too has to act in this. Please think. How sad the boy must have been to call you uncle in front of them. So, I'll stop this today. I'll tell them that this is not your grandson. I'll tell them that this is a child born out of a rape. Come what may. No, Lambodhar. Please. Don't get excited. I can understand that whatever you're doing is for my benefit. Look, if they believe that my son is their grandson, I won't mind. Thank you sir. That's why you're such a big man. Come sir. I have one request. Don't forget to bring my son to the airport. Because I want to see him waving goodbye while I'm flying. Done sir. Come sir. Hi uncle. Did you finish talking? It's over my dear child. It's over. But when did you comea and where are you staying now? I have a chemical factory in Calcutta. I had come here some business. I'm going tomorrow. Are you? We're also going to Amritsar tomorrow. Is it? I have some urgent business to look into. I'll leave. See you my child. Bye uncle. Bye. Bye, bye. No. Mr. Purnananda Rao. Shall I take Chandramouli with me? I told you about the inspection. Why did this damn inspection have to happen now? Please bring him in the morning as soon as the inspection gets over. Sure, sure. Come. Come tomorrow. I'll leave grandpa. I'll leave grandma. Namaskara. Please come Mr. Lambodhar. Take your boy. I have brought him back at the correct time. Thank you sir. Ganesha, go have food. Uncle. What is it dear? Orphans like don't know what father's or grandparents' love is like. You let me experience that love for at least three days. Thank you. I'll go. Don't think that love ends at these three days, Ganesha. I'll give you that forever. You have won my heart. I'll come tomorrow and adopt you. Those are not your daddy whom you called until today. From this moment, I'm your daddy. Is it true, uncle? Not uncle, child. Daddy. Daddy... Daddy... Daddy... Ganesha. This is a special announcement. Due to the runway problem, all planes departing from here, are delayed by 3 hours. We regret the inconvenience caused. It's good. If my son comes back from the inspection, I can spend 3 hours with him. Bring the luggage inside. Hello, Mr. Madhusudan. Hello, Mr. Anand Rao. Why are you still here? Flight's delayed? Not just late. There's runway problem. All flights are delayed. Oh my god. You said you'd bring your son. Where is he? He has inspection till 12:30 and I had flight at 1:30. I feared I might miss and came here. Probably Lambodhar would bring him. Where's your son? It's the same with him. They haven't come thinking I might have left already. Bring the luggage. Come. Madhu is here. You haven't left Madhu? No, there's runway problem. All flights are delayed by 3 hours. Then come. We shall bring our Chandramouli. We can spend 3 hours with him. No. It won't do good if we leave and they come here. Let's wait here. Sir, he's Anand Rao. We became friends in Ashok Hotel. Hello. He's Purnananda Rao. My friend's father. I see. You seem to be waiting for someone? My grandson. He's supposed to come after the inspection at his school is completed. Inspection? Which school is he in? Great Britain English School. Oh my son's school. What's your grandson's name? Chandramouli. Anyway, all three children of ours are studying there. All three children? Yes sir. My son, A. Ganesh. His son M. Ganesh. Your grandson Chandramouli. Madhu, you've a son? You didn't tell us you got married? It's a different story. He says it's a different story. They believe my son to be their grandson. Madhu, have you put your son in any hostel? No, not in hostel. He's staying in a home of someone I know. Me too. Left in hostel, boys get spoiled. That's why I have arranged for his stay at Mr. Lambodhar's place. Your son A. Ganesh is staying with Lambodhar? My grandson Chandramouli is also studying at Lambodhar's place. A. Ganesh, M. Ganesh and Chandramouli. All three are with Lambodhar. Mr. Anand Rao, there's something fishy here. No, no. He's not like that. Why worry? We'll ask him when he brings our grandson. I'm doubtful he might come. You have your grandson's photo with you? Show it. This is my son A. Ganesh. This is my son M. Ganesh. This is our grandson Chandramouli. Oh, then we've all been fooled. Let the flight be cancelled but we shouldn't let him go. Why do you look worried Lambodhar? Come inside. Come inside. We're being welcomed in our own house. You didn't bring our grandson to airport. We didn't feel like going. We cancelled the flight tickets. Oh! This is true love. Chandramouli is very lucky to have grandparents like you. Yes, yes. He's lucky to have father like me, right? Take your video cassette. You have sent us the video copy some other child's naming ceremony? Thank god. At least we got to know your plan today. I would've written my property in your name. Take your cassette. We didn't bring our cassette. Otherwise we would've thrown it at your face. What is this drama? Why are you doing this? You don't know anything? You three have planned this together. My mother! You do whatever you want. Don't ask me anything. What, you tiny? You aren't calling anyone daddy or grandpa or grandma now? From now, I won't call anyone that. He's my daddy from now on. Bloody loyalty. If he's 420 [cheat], this boy is 840 [ bigger cheat]. He has not even seen anything. Yet he lies so much and blackmails people like this now. Once he grows up, he will swindle everyone. If we leave these 2 like this, they'll build a palace out of their lies and throw dust in the eyes of people. That's why we shouldn't let them go. We have to collect all the money we have sent until now. Or show the money order counter foil and have them arrested by the police and put in jail. Or their heads must be shaven and made to sit on a donkey and take a procession out to insult them. They don't have respect to lose it. There's no use giving small punishments to these people. If you ask me, we should kill them. If I had brought my revolver, I would've shot him as soon as I got to know about his scheme. Arey, I wouldn't have cared if I went to jail. I would've been content that I killed a cheat. If you had done that, I would've felt proud. He gave us these hopes, and played with my emotions this rascal. That day, when I read his letters, I was so happy you know? Now that I know that all this is lie, I feel like there's a fire in my belly. That fire won't leave him. It'll consume him. Is everybody done? No, it will be done once you're sent to jail. Oh, it's like that. Come, let's go to police station. You give whatever complaint you want. Just because I'm sitting silent, you're revolving around me like planets and saying whatever you feel like? What, Mr. Anand Rao? Am I the only one who has wronged? I sent you a letter asking for money to raise your child. True. What kind of an idiot do you have to be to believe that? Why did you believe that? Because of your weakness. Because you were not satisfied with your wife, you wanted to sleep with all the women in this world. Because you thought all your female subordinates as prostitutes. Poor Gowri was an orphan. Without anyone. Using that weakness, you slept with her. I, using this weakness in you, took money from you. But what I've done is a big sin. And you're talking as if you've done some great deed. At least I did it for my hunger's sake. Why did you do it? For joy? Mr. Ananda Rao, why go only to police? We'll go to newspaper too. You tell them what I did to you. I'll tell them why you believed me. Then people will decide, whose mistake is bigger. My god, I don't want anything with you. What Mr. Madhu? Madhusudan the great. What all did you say? You'll send me to police station? You'll shave my head and take out a procession on a donkey? Oh, no. Don't open my secret. Why not? You were jumping until now. Mr. Purnananda Rao. It is true that I blackmailed him saying Ganesha is his son. But why did an unmarried guy like him give money to raise that child? There's the point. Lambodhar. Why talk about all that? Forget it. How can I forget it? Shouldn't I tell Purnananda Rao and Vishalakshamma that you raped their daughter in law? What did you say? Yes. The boy whom you thought to be your grandson, Madhu believed him to be his son and was sending money every month. Why? That means, when your son Chandramouli got up in the middle of the reception, and left to see you, and when your daughter in law Gowri was sleeping alone in the wedding suite, your son's friend, this Madhusudan raped her. I came to know about it and spun a web. He got caught in my web. You scoundrel. You raped my daughter in law? You sinner. What had possessed you to do that? You must be... And then you... you said your son got up in the middle of the reception and left. Why? Who's behind it? Lambodhara. Please stop it. Vishalakshi. If we stay here, he will divide us too. Shall we go? What's all this? I don't understand your route. Mrs. Sarsu Lambodhar. My route is to exploit and encash where there's weakness. Seeing the weakness in me, this Ganesha exploited me. This world is like that. You too. As long as you have weaknesses in you, until then, there will be Lambodhars, people like me, who exploit them. As long as there are people who can be cheated, there will be people who cheat. That's why... [If you have weaknesses in you, correct them. Otherwise beware of the Lambodhars.] [Subtitle by Vishu]
