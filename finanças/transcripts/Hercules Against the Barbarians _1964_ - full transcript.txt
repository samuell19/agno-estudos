[MUSIC PLAYING] COMMANDER (VOICEOVER): In the 12th century, the Mongol hordes of Genghis Khan came swarming westward out of the Gobi Desert. Having conquered China, Pesia, and Russia, they are now invading Poland. The bloodthirsty ambition of Genghis Khan is to capture the Polish stronghold Krakow. But for the first time, and that many victories, the Mongol tribes learn the bitter taste of defeat. [CRYING] -Bring it here, Chilson. . [CRYING] That's the only way to close my wound. My pain is nothing compared to our defeat. -And my suffering is less than nothing compared to your pain, Kubilai. But now the Polish can never be defeated, even with the might of the Mongols. [GASPS] That soldier, there, told me he saw a very strange power that defeated us. It seemed like a hurricane. Please come and listen to him, Kubilai. [HORSE WHINNYING] -Did you see this hurricane? Maybe it was shaped like a man. -It was a giant. -If he was so big, why didn't I see him? -Calm yourself, Kubilai, or your wound will reopen. -The battering ram in his hands seemed like a twig. He won single-handed. He even frightened the horses. And my fellow soldiers, who saw him, are all dead. Our enemies, the Christians, call him Hercules. -Hercules! [CROWD MURMURING] -Now I know what you were so afraid of, you crawling worms, your own fear, your own cowardice. You lost us Krakow! You'll pay for your villainous fears! [HORSE WHINNYING] [RIDER APPROACHING] -Oh great Kubilai, the Emperor Genghis Khan awaits you in Tarnopol. -You mustn't leave now. You have to rest, I beg you. -Get the horses ready. [GASP] -No! No! No! [SINGING IN MANDARIN] -Now there's no one left who's seen The Hurricane. [TRUMPETS SOUNDING] -The Mongols have nicknamed you The Hurricane. -I wish that I really could travel that fast. -Are you going to join Arminia now? -Yes, Vinol. -Good luck, Hercules. [GONG] -Let the traitor enter! [DOOR OPENING] On your face! I see no reason why you should be alive. You promised me that you would conquer the city of Krakow. You didn't keep your word. Let the witnesses speak. -The defeat of Krakow is do to one man, Kubilai. -And the victory at Simacon was due to one man, Kubilai. -It is useless to recall our victories when just one defeat spoils all. -The bravery of Kubilai is undisputed, My Lord. Many young warriors, like myself, wish to be at his side in the attack on the city of Krakow. -Hold your tongue, Yonga San. It'll be a long time before we can attack a Western city again. They've prepared their defense too well. What have you got to say? -I ask only to fight again. -You will have until the next full moon, Kubilai, to either sell or kill your slaves and your women. From that moment on, neither the moon nor the sun will shine on you without feeling shame. -I accept your law, my great Sovereign. -I've been told of the order of Genghis Khan. I want you to be the one to kill me. You brought me this from Simacon. Do you remember? -Yes. -I prefer to die rather than be sold. [SHEATHING KNIFE] -No one means anything to me. -But I've always been faithful to you. No, wait. -No one means anything to me except that Polish prisoner. I must know his secret. I must know it before I die. Come with me. -Why are you're going to kill him? He's a harness old man. He's lost his mind. -No, he's not mad. On the contrary, these past few years he's been making a lot of sense. Now make no mistake, that reptile has kept his secret very well. One that could have won us Krakow, and all of Poland, too. -But now he's completely blind. -No one most ever know that but me. Speak! [GASPS] I'm asking for the last time. For the last time, answer Christian dog! -How many times have you told me it was the last time? I'm used to it by now. I'm not afraid anymore. [GASP] -Don't you want to feel the warmth of the sun again? Not to live as a prisoner anymore? To live among your own people freely. -How long have I been here? -20 years. -20 years. Are you certain that I will go free? -That's your decision. -All I want is to sleep. [SHEATHING KNIFE] -I'm going to burn your face. -Aah! KUBLILAI: And then you can sleep forever! OLD MAN: Flames! Flames, just like it was then. We must get away. Save the sign of the star. The village is burning. We're being invaded by the Mongols. They have no pity for anyone. Yes, take her away. Yes. Yes. To a village far away, where no one will ever find her. Wait! Wait! I must tell you her name. -Go. I don't want you to hear this. So you see, all isn't lost after all! [GASPS] That's what you wanted, wasn't it? [SHEEP BLEATING] -Father! -What is it, Arminia? -It's wonderful news. You have to guess. -Hercules is arriving here soon? -Yes. A soldier who just came from Krakow told me. -Do you still love him? -More than ever. -Then you've decided. -If you approve, Father. -The important thing is that you're happy. Have you had a good life with me? -You're the most wonderful father a daughter could ever want. -I'm sorry we've always been poor. -Oh, but that's never bothered me. And besides, it isn't a sin to be poor. -You were born for a different life. -What are you trying to say, father? WOMAN: Get away! Burn her! Burn her! [YELLING] -Witch! You must die! WOMAN: Please, burn her! -Witch! Witch! You must die! MAN: After the witch! Burn the witch! Grab her! Don't let her get away! WOMAN: Witch! MAN: After her! Head in the forest! She'll have to die! Burn her at the stake. -Stop! -She's a witch, and a witch has to be killed. -What's she done? -She was watching my goats and making mysterious signs. And then I found one of the dead. -That's what she did! -She must die! -All witches must die. -She has the evil eye! WOMAN: We want our lives to peaceful again. She's a witch! -What has she done? -Ever since the stranger arrived, my daughter has been delirious with fever. FATHER: How did the stranger do this? -She stopped her and spoke to her. -Is this true? -Yes. -I asked her for the way. -She touched my daughter and bewitched her. -Yes. I caressed her out of gratitude. -You see? She's confessed. -This is my house. Get out. -Give us the stranger and we'll go. -We'll burn her at the stake. -You're savage beasts, not Christians. WOMAN: Terr, speak for us? -You are our adviser, and we're asking you for justice. -If you want justice, you'll get it. But without getting blindly. -We trust your judgment. -Now leave so that I can speak to this woman alone. Go on, now. Get out! -But if the stranger is the devil, then you must deliver her to us. -All right, I will. First I want to speak to her alone. -Don't worry. In our house, no one can harm you. -You have a scar, don't you? -Oh, I've had it since I was a child. My father says it makes me more interesting. By now, I'm used to it. -Cover it. You know I don't like it to be seen. -I've never seen a scar just like that. It's in the form of a star. It's a pity, Arminia, that you've never been away from here. -But Hercules promised to take along when he travels. -I know a city with tall houses, red roofs, and the cupolas are golden. It's called Krakow. -Krakow. I feel as if I know that place. There's a river. -How do you know that? -I don't know. Perhaps I just heard it, or I could have dreamed it. When I was a child, I was always dreaming. -And what did you dream of? -There was always a huge room full of light, with beautiful, soft carpets. I'd love the feeling of real carpets, because I've only walked through fields or over dirt roads. However, once I had a dream that frightened me. It's never left my mind. Someone took hold of me. Everyone else was running. There were big flames. And then I screamed. FATHER: Arminia, aren't you tired of gossiping? Why don't you go to sleep? -Right away, Father. We don't think you're a witch. Sleep well. [CREAKING] -Why are you so frightened? -Easy now. We're almost there. [DOG HOWLING] [GASPS] -Hercules. Hercules! -Whoever you are, throw me a rope. -I'm not able to see you, my friend. And I have no intention of throwing a rope to you. I just want to make sure that you're dead! -Who are you? -I am here to avenge the defeat of Krakow for the one you've condemned, Kubilai. Hercules! Hercules! Hercules! I must have hit him. We had better return to camp before sundown. [GRUNTS] HERCULES: Hey! Hey! -Who's calling? HERCULES: Hey! [CLUCKING TONGUE] -Is there's someone down there? -Throw me a rope. It's on my horse. -Of course. One moment. [GRUNTS] -How did you fall in there? -I'll tell you later, Father. We must be quick, now. -But why? -I fear something dreadful is going to happen. [OWL HOOTING] [GASPS] -Help! Help! Help! [CRYING] STRANGER: Murderers! Help! Help me! Murderers. [CRYING] [PEOPLE MURMURING] -There's-- there's something wrong with her. -Don't touch her! [PEOPLE MURMURING] -[GASP] Oh, no! Arminia, where's Arminia? Arminia? MAN: She's the witch. -Arminia! Arminia! [MOANING] MAN: Where's Arminia? What happened to her? [GASPS] -They've kidnapped her. Her father was defending her and he was killed. -Who kidnapped her? -I don't know. -Well, who was it? -I don't know! -Why are you certain she was kidnapped if you didn't see it? -Because there was no one to see. -From the very moment you arrived in our village, the Evil Eye has cursed all our houses. -Burn her at the stake! STRANGER: No! -Burn her at the stake! WOMAN: She's a witch! -You must die! STRANGER: No! [YELLING] STRANGER: No! -Ya ha! -No, no. that's not the way. She's a witch. There's only one way to free us from her spells. -No! -Yes, come on! -To the stake with her! -Let's burn her! -No! -She must burn! -No! No! WOMAN: Burn her! [YELLING] -Ugh! [GASPS] -Listen to me! It's not true what you say. They struck me before they took her away. Listen to me. You have to listen. Is there a priest nearby who will confess me? -He isn't here, and we're not gonna wait. -It's too late for you to confess your sins. You must die now. When you die, my daughter will get well. [CRYING] -Now we'll be freed from your evil spells. [CRYING] -No! No! You can't burn me. I have to live! I'm here because of your king. -Your king's the devil! [LAUGHING] -No. No! No! Oh! [SCREAMS] -Stop this! -She must die! -Enough blasphemy! [PEOPLE MURMURING] -He has no right to make us stop. -No, he hasn't. -A Mongol dagger! It was the Mongols. -I told you it wasn't I. -I believe you. Why did all this happen? Why have they kidnapped Arminia? -I would like to speak with her in your presence, Father. -You heard her, my children. You must wait outside. -Father, my life is dedicated to-- to a secret regarding Arminia, and I can't reveal it. But I would like you to see King Vladimir. He ordered me to come here. PRIEST: How do I know you are telling the truth, instead of only try evade justice? -Would you hear my confession? -Certainly, my child. You'll do well to follow the advice of the stranger. And if you would like my advice, too, Hercules, it's this. You'll hurry. -Thank you. -My children, one day soon you'll all be told the truth. And on that day, your hearts will be filled with joy. I'll go a little way with you, my friend. -You may speak, Kubilai. What is she called? -As yet, I don't know her real name. But one thing is certain that can be identified with the throne of Krakow. I wish to speak to you about an idea I have, Great Khan. We can attack Krakow some other time. -Take her to the castle. You say that a girl as delicate and lovely as this is equivalent to a city? I think you exaggerate, Kubilai. Come here. [LAUGHING] Why, she's more like a dove. Ha, ha, ha. The only thing missing are the wings. [LAUGHING] -Look. Oh Great Sovereign Khan, I want to restore your faith in me. You remember when we fought the Battle of Gulverad? One of the prisoners I captured was a nobleman. His crazy babbling always troubled me. He was speaking of her when he said, the sign of the star, save her. Save the princess. It's only in the past few days that I've been able to reconstruct the whole story and find out where the girl was hiding. This girl is the heiress to the throne of Krakow and thus, to half of Poland. -A queen? You may speak if you wish. Who are you? -This man is mistaken. I'm the daughter of a shepherd. -Either you don't know, or you're pretending not to know your origin. I propose to find out which. -With your permission, great Genghis Khan, I shall bring into your presence my Polish prisoner. The prisoner! That's not all. While I was searching for the girl, I discover that she knew a man called Hercules. He's been captured and rendered harmless. -When Hercules finds out you've kidnapped me, he'll save me. I'm sure of that. -Who is this Hercules? -An impostor. That's not even his name. -Did young Gason help you with this plan of yours? -Yes. OLD MAN: The sign of the star! Don't tell anyone who you are. Everyone here is spying. The Mongols must never be told that your were saved. We carried you to a village. When you star had grown, you were to become queen. There was no other way to rescue you from the Mongols of Genghis Khan. They have kept me buried alive with my memories of the past, and forced me to relive those last terrible hours. No. No! You mustn't use your real name. You will say that-- you will say your name is Arminia. The day will come when you'll reclaim the name that is yours. -I thought we had exterminated the whole family. -No one in your village must ever know. When the time comes, you will be queen. Oden's throne is yours. -Don't speak any more. -You must obey. Kierra. My daughter! -The king of Poland is dead. You're Kierra of Poland. This girl is worth a kingdom. [CRYING] COMMANDER: On men! Forward! The Mongols will not try to attack Krakow again. Therefore, we might as well get out of Poland. There's nothing for us to do now except to attack and reconquer Tarnopol. -Sire, I have come from our encampment. Arias has just returned there with Hercules. -Good news. I would like to speak with our defender of Krakow. Let's go. [TRUMPETS SOUNDING] -Doubtless the Mongols have discovered the true identity of Arminia. They'll use her as a hostage. -They will succeed. I shall rescue her. Arminia means everything to me. -There's something I have to tell you. In a certain sense, I share the sentiments you've shown toward Arminia. -I don't understand. The father of Arminia and my father decided to unite the two kingdoms to form a bigger and stronger Poland. This was their pact and they swore to keep it. And you cannot break this union between me and the woman you've only known by the name of Arminia. And who, in reality, is Kierra of Poland. Our bond is sacred. Arminia's father disappeared 20 years ago in the Battle of Gulverad. I'm glad that Arminia has been friends with a man as brave as you. But now the national interest takes precedence over personal feelings. Only a reunited Poland can resist and overcome the aggressions of Genghis Khan. Now you are free to renounce your pledge to save Kierra of Poland. Or should I say, Arminia? -Arminia is a queen now. -If I save her, I shall lose her forever. -I'm sorry. -Very well, I have decided. I shall renounce my claim on her. But I shall rescue her just the same. -No one has ever made a gesture more noble than yours, but the King insists that you leave as soon as you've sworn to renounce her. -He's right. -He wants me to accompany you. He thinks it would be easier to enter Tarnopol if you were with me. -Are you tired? -I prefer to go on. We still have a long way. -If you can keep on going, I'd like to travel until sunset. Thank you. -Do you want more? -No, thank you. I'd better go light some fires before the wolves come. -Hercules. -Yes? -Sleep well. -Goodnight. -Why did you do that? Aren't we leaving? -Yes, but on foot. If the horses were to make the smallest sound, it would draw the attention of the Mongols. -You're right. I'll try to make it. HERCULES: Well, let's hurry. -Tomorrow at daybreak, we must be in Tarnopol. [WIND HOWLING] -Are you certain that we'll be able to enter the palace of Genghis Khan? -Yes, I'm certain. -I don't want to take many risks with you along. -How will we get across? -I know how. Wait a minute. -I'm afraid. -Now that we've come this far, there's no point in turning back. Come on. Don't look down. [SCREAMS] -No! No, save me! HERCULES: Give me your hand. [GASPING] -Let's go. Let me guide you. Don't look down. That's it. [WIND HOWLING] [GASPS] -Someone's coming! -Maybe it's the Mongols. -We had better hide. [LATCHING DOOR] [BABIES CRYING] -No, it's Hercules. -Hercules? Well, open the door! -Welcome. [SIGH] We were afraid it was the Mongols. -Are you ill? -No, it's nothing. Tomorrow I'll be feeling better. Thank you. Don't you see everything's against so far? It seems to be a prediction of our destiny. But why should you take so many risks? Arminia has been captured by the Mongols, and they've never released anyone. I'm certain that she's been taken far away from here. -But I feel she's still in Tarnopol. -You know the Mongols well, Hercules. And you know the fate they reserve for their prisoners. Isn't it better to forget than to see the terrible torture she suffered? -That's enough! -Forgive me, but I don't want to see you suffer. And within a few days, Vladimir's soldiers are attacking the Mongols. It's better that he take revenge and save the life of the woman he's to marry. -I've given my word! I'm going to Tarnopol. [ROOSTER CROWING] [CREAKING] [SHEEP BLEATING] -Where's Hercules? -Have some hot tea. I know you'll feel better. -Answer my question. -He's been gone since daybreak. [LAUGHING] -The little dove has bared her talents. Ha, ha, ha. Her royal talents. This is my decision. You will marry Ogatai, my son, the best warrior in the Empire. -The Queen of Poland refuses to obey you. -You'll join Ogatai in Asia. -I'd prefer death to marrying your son. -Through the centuries, our women have obeyed us and fulfilled our desires. And so will you. That girl will cause Ogatai more trouble than the Chinese. MAN: Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! Help! -What's happened? -To make fast time, we were moving through the swamp land. Take my knife! Here! Kill him! Kill him! Kill him! Thanks for your aid, my friend. My name's Perias. -Where are you going? -To Tarnopol. -To Tarnopol? -Yes, we amuse them all, the Mongols and the Poles. As acrobats, we haven't any homeland. -Hm. -You could earn yourself a fortune with your strength. HERCULES: Hm! -Why don't you come with us? I'll pay you well, eh? -I accept. -What's your name? -Maybe someday I'll tell you my name, but now I can't. It was my strength that saved me, not my name. [LAUGHING] [GONG] [LAUGHING] Master of the Universe, I have set aside a unique spectacle for your attention. A mortal man whose strength borders on the supernatural. His equal has never been seen, neither in the heavens nor on Earth. My own countryman, Hercules reborn. [MURMURING] MAN: Ah, look what they've got here. [GRUNTS] -This is not a mystery or a trick. -Why not try that? [GRUNTS] [MURMURING] -Are you sure that you killed Hercules? -I know I did. I shot him while the serpent was choking the life out of him. -Is your champion able the wrestle with my Kregar? -My lore, may I suggest that they duel to the death? It might prove more interesting. -Does your man agree to this? -Agree to it. Say, yes. -Yes. [MURMURING] -Lances. -Ugh! [GRUNTING] [MURMURING] -Oh! Hey! [GRUNTING] [GASP] -Ugh! -Oh! -Oh, come on, now. [GRUNTING] [LAUGHING] MAN: Hey! -Hey! MAN: Whoa! [MURMURING] -Let me live! No! Have pity! [YELLING] MAN: Don't spare his life, kill him! -Thank you. [MURMURING] MAN: Well, well, well. -That man disobeyed your orders. He's the one who should die. -When I want your counsel I'll ask you. Is that clear? This man will live. -I must speak to you. -What do you want? -Are you interested in knowing the name of the man who showed mercy to Kregar? -Yes. But I don't trust you. You went away from us, and you've been away too long. -My father was a Mongol. You mustn't forget it. -That's the girl I was talking about. She watched you closely. -Arias! -Open it. -Do you know her? -What are you doing here? -Don't ask me anything. Come with me. Uh-- -You can trust him. -I believe I can take you to Arminia. -Arminia? Where is she? -There's no time to waste. Hurry. -I must go at once my friend. What I have to do is-- -You're going to release her from the Mongols if you're able to. Can I be of any use to you? -You've done more than your share. Take your children to safety. -Open the gate. -I wish you luck. -Let's go. -Through there. Now you're safe. -What have you done? -Thank you. Anyone who breaks into the house of Genghis Khan must die. Your turn has come. -What are you doing? I trapped him here, but the pact was that you wouldn't touch him. You promised me. Ugh! [UNSHEATHING A KNIFE] [GRUNTS] -Ugh! Forgive me. I did this because I love you. [GASPS] [GRUNTS] -What are you're doing? -In front of me you swore to Arias that you would honor your pledge. [GRUNTS] [GRUNTS] [SWORDS CLANGING] [GRUNTS] -Ugh! -Aah! Ugh! -Aah! -Take him away! -Agh! -Ugh! -Hie! Ho! Ha! -Oh! -No. I must go alone. If we went that way the Mongols would see us. -I want to go with you. -They would kill you on the way out. I want you to come, but I must leave you here. Don't worry, I'll return soon. This I promise you. -God will protect us. [WARRIORS RUNNING] -The Christians send their servants to get you. We prefer to use our own hands. As a queen, you have the right to refuse any proposal of marriage made to you. I'm thinking of Ogatai. I believe that our laws were explained to you. According to our custom, you can only refuse once. You're about to get another husband. One you don't even deserve. A better man than Ogatai. Me. -Pig! I'll never marry you. Don't come any nearer or I'll kill you. [MOANING] -Ha, ha. You show real courage, like a queen. That's the way I like my women. You're fit to stand at my side. -I doubt that the Great Khan knows of your idea. -As a matter of fact, you're right. But I'll chance that. Tomorrow morning, Genghis Khan is leaving to see my brother, Ogatai. But he'll never get there alive to see him. [INAUDIBLE TALKING OUTSIDE] [GASP] [HORSE WHINNYING] -Sire, I bring you news of great importance. Genghis Khan, the Emperor of the Mongols has been killed. And they say that his sons are already struggling for the succession. -This is the moment we've been hoping for. Victory is at hand! And tomorrow, Tarnopol will be ours! Forward! [TRUMPETS SOUNDING] -Hear me! Hear me, commander of the Polish forces. Retreat from this city, or your blood will stain these walls. And your army will be slaughtered. -Who are you to speak this way to me? -I am Supreme Commander of this city. And all these lands are mine. -You're mad! For centuries this area has belonged to Poland. You Mongols took it by ignoring and breaking all our treaties. [LAUGHING] -If you do not withdraw your attack, I cannot be responsible for her life. [SCREAMING] [WARRIORS YELLING] -Go on, save yourself. [GRUNTS] -Ugh, no! -You won't get away. I've decided to kill you right now. You're coming with me. [GRUNTS AND SOUNDS OF BATTLE] -Go and save Arminia! [HORSE WHINNYING] [SWORDS CLANGING] [HORSE WHINNYING] -Take her in there! [BATTLE SOUNDS] -Cavalry to the attack! [BUGLE SOUNDING] [FIRE CRACKLING] [GRUNTS] [GRUNTS] -Kregar! Listen to me, I hope that what I heard you say isn't true. And that it was only a dream you were having. -Now I understand. I was drugged. I did what he ordered me to do without knowing it. -You spoke of Genghis Khan? -Genghis Khan? -You said with your own hands you-- -I killed him. I killed Genghis Khan. I killed him. I've committed the most treacherous act in the history of the Mongols. -Go on, avenge Genghis Khan! -Ugh, ooh! [MOANING] -Kill him! You heard me, kill him! [SCREAMS] KREGAR: I've avenged Genghis Khan. [GASP] [BATTLE SOUNDS] -Quick! Everybody to the palace, come on! [HORSE WHINNYING] -Look out! Ugh! -Agh! -Kregar! Take her out of here! -We have won! Tarnopol is once again Polish! The cavalry must ride after the Mongols. We have won. -During these years of the Mongol's oppression, I was hidden in a village. No one told me who I was. -We put you there for your own safety. -I thank you. -I have fulfilled our parents' oath to our countries. It was your father who saved you when you were small. -Yes, I know that. All those years, he was a prisoners of the Mongols. He resisted all their tortures and beatings without telling them anything. When I finally saw him, he was almost dead. -God has willed that you should be saved for our people. At last, there will be a queen on the throne of Poland. COMMANDER (VOICEOVER): Once again, our own flags fly above our liberated country. The invader has been thrown back. Homeless people can now return to their city, and they will quickly bury the events of the years of oppression in their joy the home they have found again. The defeated warrior is leaving our borders. Let us hope forever. -You are now our chief. We await your orders. -We're abandoning this country and returning to Mongolia. -I made a promise. -I know. You swore to give me up so you could save me. -But I also had to take a solemn oath. -I was queen for a very short time. But during my reign I released you from your pledge. I have entrusted Poland to those who are more capable of ruling. I want only to be Arminia, and to have you close to me. -And I will love you forever. [MUSIC PLAYING]
