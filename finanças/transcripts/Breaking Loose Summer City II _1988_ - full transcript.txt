Need a hand? - Oh, right. - Ross here is a medical student, a specialist in the female form, and I'm his assistant. A day in surgery and we can have you feeling a different person in no time. - Thanks for the offer. But I think I'll keep ahold of what I've got. (laughs) - Sorry. Sorry, I'm sorry. Just go around me, go around the other way. Oh, come on, I'm sorry, it was a joke. I'm sorry I was joking, oh, c'mon, please, honey. I'm sorry. Ross, we're buddies, right, pal? - It's a good look. - Don't you do it to me. - It'll catch on. - Ross, Ross, Ross. Miss, come on, one of them, please. (man yells) - Party time. (woman screams) - You like it. Feel my heart is rising between my legs. (woman laughs) - [Man] Hey, hey, hey. - Oh, oh, oh, friendly types, aren't they? - Right up themselves, I reckon. - You're not invited. You're not wanted. Now take a hike. - [Group] Oh. - Listen, asshole. - Whoo. - Hey, you heard him now, disappear. (girls laugh) - We'll just have to go and make our own party, okay? - Right. (laughs) - [Man] Ah, let's go anyway. - [Man] Hey. - What's up, bringing rent-a-crowd. - It's bloody gatecrashers. - Where? - Outside, right next to your car, mate. - Ross. (ominous music) - Oh mate, you're not wanted, now piss off. Get away from the car. - No, Ross. No, Ross. - Stay away. - Is this far enough? - I like you. - Get your bloody hands off me. - I really think you're very nice. - Get away. - [Man] Hey. - You've got no manners. I've gonna carve my initials all over your face. - Don't be stupid, mate. - And all over your car. - What we have here is a matter of honor. Let's settle this like gentlemen. (engines rev) (suspenseful music) Remember, like gentlemen. (screams) (gang laughs) (tires screech) (crowd cheers) (motorcyclist yells) - Bloody maniac, whoa. (man yells) (man shouts) Woo hoo. (laughs) (metal scrapes) (laughs) (horn honks) (man screams) (explosion booms) - Ross? - Oh, Jesus. - If this fruitcake dies, you're up for second degree murder. Never mind the other offenses involved. Now do yourself a favor, son, we know you've got a juvenile record. So will you stop trying to be the silent hero for Christ's sake and tell me what happened. (taps on door) - The parents are here, sir. - Charming. - [Man] Would you come in, please? - [Man] What happened? - Some stupid drag race. Caused a lot of damage. Put one fella in hospital. He's in a pretty bad way. - How bad? - [Officer] Bad. - And you, Ross, what have you got to say for yourself? - Your son's attitude is gonna get him a long way. About from here down to the cells below. - Is this true, Ross? - How about bail? At least, we'd like him home with us. - I'll see what I can do. I can't promise. - More bloody trouble again. - [Man] Same as me. - Ross, you okay? Did it go alright? - Come on, he's okay. - Mr. Cameron, you'll need to sign some papers. - I'm sorry. Everything just got out of hand. - Then tell Rick that, please. (suspenseful music) (mellow music) - Nice body, eh? - No one ever gave you a paint job like this? - Didn't need one, did I? - True. - So what brings you down from your ivory tower? - Supplies. Can't rely on anything getting to Wandarra these days. - No, you will insist on living in a place no one ever heard of. - Except you. I like it that way. - It's good to see you. - Ta. How's the kid? - Well, the day he was old enough to open a car door on his own, Ross stopped being a kid. (laughs) - Sounds like my kind of guy. - Yes, well you're much alike you and he. He's got a chip on his shoulder, too. - Oh. Not anymore. (laughs) - Same old Robbie. - Thought I heard someone pull up. - Robbie's down on business. - Making surfboards, call that a business? - Each to their own. Never could handle sitting behind a desk. - Yeah, well you stick to what you do best. And don't interfere elsewhere. - Rick, that's uncalled for. - Yeah, well I think it's time I went. - Oh, nonsense, you only just got here, and besides, this is my house, too. And seriously, I would like to talk to you. (rock music) - I'll pick up my stuff later. - Okay. - Thanks, mate. - Alright, see you, mate. - I don't know what to do. If it's not one, it's the other. They're always at each other's throats. - You knew it wouldn't be easy when you married Rick. Never is when there's other kids involved. - It shouldn't be this difficult. I mean sometimes I think Ross is a walking time bomb. But one day, he's going to just-- - That your heap out the front? - You're home. You remember Robbie Atkins, from Wandarra. - You ought to be put in jail for life for treating your car like that. It's criminal. Birds been fed yet? - I was going to do that when Robbie-- - Don't bother, I'll do it. - See what I mean? This is one of his better days. - He's got a will of his own, that's for sure. Mind you, I was about the same when I was his age. Couldn't tell me anything, I knew it all, you know that. - Will you try and have a word with him? We just can't seem to get through anymore. - Okay. (wistful piano music) Never got into birds, least not the feathered type. Got a randy old terrier back in Wandarra, more interested in the Sheilas than digging for a bone. - Do alright down here then. - Not a chance, he's got Wandarra blood through and through, just like me. - What's it like up there? Mum's always so guarded about it. - Wandarra's Wandarra. Bit like a woman over 60, I suppose. Every guy know she's there but no one wants to know. - Then why stick it out? - Sucker for punishment. Besides, I've got a good group of mates. And the surf is as good as you'll find anywhere. - Now I remember. You and Rick don't really hit it off. Reckons you're a bad influence, beach bum. - I been called worse by some of the Wandarra locals. People always want to put labels on you. You find that? (wistful piano music) Listen, why don't you come up sometime? Door's always open, great place to unwind. - What, and leave the suburban dream? - Don't be so hard on 'em. They're like all parents. They want to please but don't always know when to say the right thing. - I can do without the hearts and flowers number, okay. I think I know my folks better than you or anybody else. - I can't handle this. Only have to mention your name, and dad goes off the deep end. They just don't understand. - Maybe we should have a break, just for awhile. - Oh, that's great. I take all the pressure at home because I stand up for you, and you want us to have a break? Ross, I need you. My dad thinks I'm still a little girl. He never sees me as somebody with feelings, as an adult. Well, haven't you got anything to say? - You know how I feel about you. - No, I don't. I always have to guess. You never state your true feelings other than that damn car. Look, I know things are tough for you at the moment. - Yeah. - But it would just be nice to hear you say what you felt, just once. - I feel. - That's all. I feel as if everything is closing in around me. I need some time and space to myself. Can you understand that? Things are tough enough at home. Now I've got all this bloody stuff with the cops. - Fine, if it's space that you want, Ross, you take as much as you want. Don't expect me to be there just when it's convenient for you. (suspenseful music) - [Man] We got the bastard. - [Man] Where you go? - [Man] C'mon. (gang screams and yells) - [Woman] Stop him. (driving rock music) - What do you want from me? - [Man] You're bloody, mate. - [Woman] You're a dickhead. - [Man] End of the line, Ross. Our brother Skunk is not feeling very well. - It was a fair race. - Because of you. They say there's a chance he won't leave the hospital. - [Man] Run. - Back off. Back off. Roll up your sleeve. Weazel. - Ah man, no, ah. (suspenseful music) I'm a very religious man, Ross. I believe, I really do believe, in an eye for an eye. Watch your back, Ross. (group laughs) (harmonica music) - [Rick Voiceover] What is it with you? I treat you as if you were my own and all you wanna do is fight with me. - [Ross Voiceover] You never stop do you? You're not my father, just leave me alone. - [Caroline Voiceover] For goodness sake, I mean stop arguing with each other. - [Ross Voiceover] He's your husband, not my father. - [Caroline Voiceover] Ross, all Rick wants to do is to be your friend.

Hey, piss off, this is my house. - We know it's here, Atkins. - Well, you've got one up on me. What's here? - Let's forget the games, eh, (sniffs). - Coke. - Oh. - We're not mugs here, you know. - Well, if you say so. - Aw, come on Bill, what do you think this is? A service center for junkies or something? - Don't push your luck, Atkins, it's here, and we'll find it. - Come on Davie, let's leave Miami mice to it, eh. - We're in deep shit, white man. - Oh, don't get dark on me mate. It's another set up again. - Yeah, nice to be popular, eh. (police radio squawks) Ah, sprung, we were about to have our morning snort. - One of these days, I'm gonna ram my boot right up your smart ass. - Oh, hohoho. - [Detective] I'll fix you Atkins, and your black mate. - Hey, hey, hey, hey, relax, relax. They got to get their kicks somehow. - Yeah, but we still got a problem. - Is there anymore? - You're looking at it. - Hey. Get off, you mutt. - Now what? Rooter, down. Bloody dog, he's all dentures anyway. Oh, what are you doing here? - Taking you up on your offer. - Aren't you supposed to be in college? - End of term. - Davie, this is Ross. This is my mate, Davie. - [Ross] Great, how are you? - Glad to meet you, Ross. - What's the police car doing back there? - Bill, an old surfer. Likes to think he's Clint Eastwood. Always making his own rules. - Yeah, he could never stand the thought that old Waters here was a better board runner than him. He's always looking for an excuse to stick one on us. - Come on in. Hello, shithead. - Another pet? - Yeah, Livingston's the name, he's got a busted wing. A regular RSPCA we've got here. Careful, he'll shit all over you. (bird squawks) - Are these your designs? - No, Davie's. What he doesn't know about painting and screen printing isn't worth knowing. None better. - Yeah. - I'm impressed. - So are the customers. You bring the Chevy? - Thumbed it. - Oh, yeah? - [Davie] You had a feed yet? - Hamburger, last night. - I'll see what I can get. eh. - Well as you can you see, it's every man for himself around here, you can either bed down with us under the stars or try the Hilton out the back. - Here. - Uh, beautiful. Frozen pizza. - Breakfast. Welcome to Wandarra. - Land of the living dead. - [Unison] Cheers. (all laugh) (dramatic music) (machine beeps) - jeez, I hate this big hour rush in Wandarra, don't you, mate? - Enough to make a man want to go bush, Waters. - [Ross] You two must be the star attraction around here. - Don't have to do much to be a star around here, mate. (whistling) - [Man] Better clean the cells out. - He's got my name on the door already. - [Man] Hey Robbie, your share. - Yeah, you got change of five cents. (laughs) Two big beers, thanks, George. And the usual for Davie. (sniffs) - It's like a bloody police lineup every time I come here. - Don't let it bother you, mate. Anything that moves is looked upon as being different around here. - Like a prize hen. Here, my share. - Your mate old enough to drink this stuff. - Does the grouch have its beard? He's old enough to drink. - Hey, Davie. - Hey, Scollop. - How you been? - You wanna see a prize hen? Look over there, mate. Helen's her name, good sort. We go back a few years, Helen and me. - [Ross] She looks out of place around here. - Thanks, I'd like to see some money. - Hi, Robbie, who's the stray? - Ross, son of an old friend. You remember Caroline Dixon. - It'd be difficult not to. - Ross, Helen, an old friend of your mum's and mine. - [Man] Aw, shit. Jesus. - Right hole, wrong ball, Neville. Still, at least you're consistent. So, you're Caroline's son. - That's what they tell me. - Well, this is certainly a trip down memory lane. How long you here for, Ross? - Just taking a break from college. - He turned up this morning. Old Davie and me, were entertaining for breakfast. - Yes, I heard you got a visit this morning. - Nothing gets past you, does it? - Not if I can help it. Did you tell Ross about my place? - He's got a place to crash. - Atkins, five star. If the sand bugs don't get you, the high tide will. Listen, I run the only guest house in town. It's basic, but it's still a damn sight more comfortable than sleeping on the beach. - Thanks all the same, beach'll be fine. - I hate to be turned down, don't I, Robbie? - Oy. - Neville. - I wanna have a word with you. - Neville, please, will you leave me alone? For God's sake, Neville, you're embarrassing me. - Domestic, always at each other's throats. It'd be a dull time in Wandarra, the day those two didn't fight. - Gotta rub my nose in it, night and day with every stray dog on heat. - You're drunk. Go and sleep it off. Must be way past your bedtime by now. - I heard your scheming. I won't have that kid in my house, do you hear? - Your house? You got a memory problem, Neville. It's my house. And with all the bad debts that go with it. I won't have you tell me who I can or cannot have in my own house. - Don't walk away when I'm talking to ya. - You wouldn't know what conversation was. The only time you open your mouth is to fill it full of booze. (dramatic piano music) It's settled. You're staying at my place. Be a nice change to have somebody around I can talk to. Bring Ross over when you're finished here. - What was that all about? - Helen and Neville. - The only live entertainment we get around here in Wandarra. (motorcycles rev) - This has been going on for four days, day and night. Can't last much longer, surely. (engines rev) (rock music) - Check his blood pressure every hour from now on. - Oh. (dramatic music) - Hope I'm not too late. Came to see my friend, and offer him a little liquid refreshment. Something to recharge his batteries, know what I mean. - But you can't come in here, you, you. - Now look, for god sakes. - Excuse me. Try some of this, me old mate. Good year, this one, Skunk. That's me boy. - There you go. Home for wayward strangers. - So this is a good idea? - No. Go on, live a little. Helen's a pussy cat, she won't eat you. - Bloody shithead. - Watch the paintwork. Then again, she might. - Hi Ross. - Hi. - Come in. Ah, this is my daughter, Tammy, and her boyfriend, Brad. - G'day. - Hi. - How are you? - Yeah. - [Helen] Ross is staying with us for awhile. - Yeah, well, see you later, Helen. Tammy. - Eats a lot of red meat, does he? - Sort of, Brad's always like that with strangers. Come on. Neville, this is Ross. You know, our guest. - Yours not ours. - No manners when he's watching his favorite program. (burps) Don't worry about him. You'll get used to it. I've had to all these years. Be a love and put the kettle on. I'm sure Ross could do with a cup of coffee. - Thanks. - Now, make yourself at home and tell us all about your mum. - What about his bloody father?

Hey. - Still giving the young fellas a run for their money, eh, Waters? - Couldn't waste a top day inside. Besides, he's not bad for a young fella. - Old bugger. - You had an unexpected visitor this morning. Rooter gave him a warm reception. Didn't you, mate? - Yeah, who? - Our mate, the pool shark. - Nev? How does she stomach the gall of that? - It's a long story, mate. I'll tell you about it one day. - A lot of skeletons up here, eh. - Yeah, Neville's certainly got a few in his closet. It's been years he's gonna treat the family like shit ever since. - Know how they feel. Been living with Rick for the past 10 years, snide remarks, dirty looks. When I do try to be nice, dead silence. - [Davie] That's white fellas for you. (laughs) - Nyuck, nyuck. - Oh. - Yeah, you're weird, man. (didgeridoo music) - Ross, I don't want to go poking my nose in where it's not wanted, but have you told your mum you're here yet? - Who says I haven't? - Don't go bullshitting a bullshitter, mate. - I will. I just had to go. Haven't you ever had that feeling of being closed in and just had to pack up and piss off. - Sure, all the time. Trouble is I always get drawn back to where I started from. A place called home. You've gotta get your act together there first, mate, before you can do anything else. (slow guitar music) - Going my way? - Yeah. - Hop in. (mellow music) What's on your mind? C'mon, can't be all that bad. Young man like you shouldn't have a care in the world. - Why do you put up with him? - Circumstances. I should have got out long ago, like your mum did. - What do you mean? - Oh, let her tell you. Thing is I'm still here, doing the same thing, day in, day out. - Don't have to be stuck here to feel like you're in a rut. Sometimes you can get a raw deal wherever you are. - Oh you're just what I want. Remind me to call you when I'm feeling suicidal. - Sorry, just the way I feel. What? - You've got quite a head on those shoulders, haven't you? - Yeah, like one of those sideshow clowns. Half the world seems to want to have a go at knocking it off. - What a waste, anything but a clown. - Oh, we should be getting back. - What for? Just to get back on the old merry-go-round with Neville? You asked how I put up with him. I told you, with great difficulty. For all he cares, I could be another guy. I'm a woman, Ross, I need to be appreciated, to be told, to be touched. - Helen, this isn't right. - Who's to say what's right, what's wrong? (slow piano music) It's been so long, Ross. - Someone's coming. - Jeez. - Problem's, Helen? - No, it's okay, just starter troubles. - Well, if you need a hand. - No, it's alright, I can manage. (engine starts) See. - Drive carefully, won't you? (slow piano music) - So, what do you think of our little town, city boy? - Okay. - Just okay? - It's been a long day, I think I'll hit the sack. - Stick around, mate. Have a beer, tell us all about yourself, your mother, and that beach bum, Atkins. - Neville. Tammy, you're late. - Your mum said you're late. - Okay, so I'm late, is that a crime? - What's wrong, hon? - Nothing. - Nothing. You bloody women are all the same. You say nothing when you really mean, "My whole world's falling in on me." - Is it Brad? What did he do this time? - I am sick of having to do everything he wants to do. Sweet pea. (chuckles) - Ah, women, give 'em a kiss and card, (slurs words alhoholically) right, love? Right, love? - Let me go. - Hey, hey, hey, don't forget who you're talking to. Don't forget it was me that got you out of all that trouble and I can put you right back in. - I don't care. I've had enough. You can do what you want. - What's up? Gettin' the knife elsewhere? What are you looking at? (dramatic piano music) - Have to be bloody strong to put up with him. Don't know how you do it, the guy's an animal. - I'm trapped, Ross. Sometimes I don't know what to do, I could scream. What's the use? I'm sorry about what happened in the car. It's just that I get so lonely, so depressed, I long for some real company. (waves thunder) (surf music) (Group talks over one another) - [Man] Hey. - [Man] Welcome, once again to the annual Moon Doggie's Surf Day, where the hottest surf and ski riders are with us from all over the state.

I said-- - I heard you the first time. - There's nothing to drink in the house. - If you're so bloody thirsty, why don't you go back to the pub? And leave me in peace. Or has Harry cut off your credit again? - That shit, Everingham, he knows where he can stick his pub. - Well, you might try and behave like a normal human being for a change, and stay sober. Forget your first aid kit? - Eh? Oh, yeah. Where is she? - If you're referring to Tammy, she's out. - Out, where? - The beach. Surf carnival. - Surf carnival, bunch of no-hopers. Christ, you've got our daughter playing your little games. - Now look what you've done. - She's with him, isn't she? - With who? - Your guest. Anyone mixing with Atkins and that black mate of his would have to be a troublemaker. Christ, you have got a short memory, after what Atkins and that kid's mother did. The trouble they caused. - Don't you ever let sleeping dogs lie? - Not when you're around. - Get out. For God's sake, leave me alone. (dramatic piano music) - You should have seen the look on his face. (chuckles) - [Neville] You know what time it is, mate? - Dad. - Dad. What's your idea of getting around this way? - It's a long walk from the beach, dad-- - Shut up. I want to hear it from smart ass here. - Leave him alone, it's not his fault. - I said shut your dirty mouth. - You bastard. - You prick. - Neville. - I'm not gonna hit you, mate. - Leave him alone. Stop it. - Go behind my back, I'll teach you. I don't want that bastard in my house. - Get out, you hear me, ya drunken moron, get out. - Alright, alright. - Tammy, get the first aid kit. Bastard. I'm so sorry Ross, I don't know what to say. - What are you still doing here with him? Why don't you just get out? There's no reason to be trapped here with an animal like that. - It's not as easy as that, you don't understand. Ross, please let me help you. - Sorry, I just gotta get out. I'm gonna see Robbie and I'm gonna piss off. - Sleep on it, make up your mind in the morning. - No, no, no, I've made up my mind now. I'm just gonna go. Appreciate your help. I'm just gonna go. - I didn't know tortoises were orange. - Tortoise, it's a turtle. - Oh. - Yeah, and I'm surprised you can see anything after last night's effort. - Ha ha ha. - Whose leg's that, Rooter? Good morning. - Jeez, what happened to you, mate? - I ran into one of Neville's drunken rages. - Jesus Christ, a bloody animal. I should have let Rooter take his leg off. - Bastard, I'll ring his bloody neck. Deserves a hiding, that one. - Helen beat you to it, mate. She kicked him so hard in the nuts, he's wondering if he's Arthur or Martha. (laughs) - Well, what's his mum say? - She was just glad to know where Ross was. - I mean about his condition. - Nah, I don't want to get her all upset. Could be on his feet in a few days. - Really, look, here's our mate. - Well, well, what a pleasant surprise. Hello, Nev. - What do ya want, Atkins? - Well, me and Davie here, we just wanted to tell you how much we admired you. I mean any man who beats up his wife, slaps his daughter around, and puts a boot into young kids, well, you have to look up to them, you know what I mean? - Piss off, Atkins, I'm in no mood for your jokes. - As a matter of fact, neither am I. - Oh, oh. - I think an apology's called for, don't you, Nev? Nev. - Okay, I'm sorry. - Did you hear what he said, Davie. - Nope, not me, Waters. - Didn't hear you, Nev. Nev. - Sorry. - Just remember, if it happens again, I'll stick your dick in fiberglass. - Fiberglass. Who do you think you are? (laughs) (screams loudly) (gang all yell) - [Man] Get out of the way. - [Man] Move it. (group yells) - [Man] Go on bugger, get out. (laughs) - [Man] Wheelie now. - [Man] C'mon. - [Man] Out of the way. (ominous music) - Give 'em hell, Skunk. - See you in heaven, mate. (shotgun slides) (shotgun fires) (explosion blows) - Time to play. (birds squawk) - He's in Wandarra. - Wandarra, where's that? Do you have any idea when he's coming back? - In a couple of days. He has to, it's part of his bail conditions. (doorbell rings) Did you bring a friend? - No. (gang laughs) (pounds on door) - [Group] Whoo hoo. - We're looking for Ross. - Who are you? What do you want? - Friends. We're concerned about his welfare. We're very worried about him. - He's not here, but if you give me your name, I'll tell him to get in touch with you. - Ah, give her a visitor card, Saps. - You heard me, now please go. - Aww, she wants us to go. (laughs) - Wait a second, he's not here. - [Man] Hey. - You are beginning to annoy me. - [Man] You're annoying him. - Shut up, Weazel. Search the house. - Upstairs. - Listen carefully mother, our brother, Skunk, left here for a place he did not choose to go. Your dear Ross sent him there. - Let me go. - [Man] Ooh. - Little bitch tried to get out the back. - No, empty. - Now, you're almost as much to blame as your boyfriend is, aren't you? A little help from you could make all the difference, otherwise I might be forced to hand you over to my friends here. - Hand her over. - Let's make a sandwich of her. - Well? - I don't give a damn what you do. - She's mine. (knife clicks) (laughs) Nice, eh? - Yeah. - Leave her alone. - I'll tell you where he is. - No, Mrs. Cameron, no. - It's my decision, Jacky. (knife clicks) - Wise decision, mother. - [Woman] Love your hairdo, mum. Vidal Sassoon. (laughs) Eric loves the smell on you. - So tell us, mum, where is he? (blues music) - What is it with folks around here? You two are the sanest ones I've met. - Got my doubts about him. - Yeah, right. - Ah, you gotta understand them. How their minds work. - Oh, they've got minds, have they? - Yeah. - I've been a target ever since the trouble with your mum. - What trouble? - Oh, something that happened 20 years ago. It still seems like only yesterday. A few of us got together and organized a bucks night for one of our mates. Caroline met Boo, your real dad. And things, just got out of hand. Caroline's old man went berserk. Took off after Boo with a shotgun. We were caught in the middle. Was nothing we could do. - She's never talked to me about it. - It's not exactly the kind of thing you swap over the back fence. - What was he like, Boo, my real father? - A total headcase. (laughs) Always inviting trouble. Aw, we were great mates. Yeah, I think you two would have got on fine together. - Still don't know how you guys stick it out here. - Maybe I need to be close at hand. So I can rattle the skeletons every now and again. - Yep, one place is much the same as any other for blokes like me. You just take rough with the smooth. At least we've got our dreamtime to fall back onto. - What's dreamtime? - Listen, you'll learn a thing or two. - Life's like a pattern, see. Just like people. Some people think backward, some think forwards. Once you understand the order, you can end on anything and anybody. - Order, what? - Separating the good eggs from the bad. - And there's a lot of bad eggs around here. (all laugh) - It's funny, isn't it? The way things work out. I shoot through from Sidney, thinking I'm getting away from all that pressure, and find out you guys have got exactly the same hassles up here. - Yep. If you can't handle the heat, you better get out of the fire. - Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo. - Ah ah ah, whoo. - Nyuck, nyuck, nyuck. - Errr. (laughs) - Dickheads. (water rushes) (ominous music) (dog barks) - Davie, the house. - What's going on? Hey. (engine revs) - Good boy, Rooter. Good boy, mate. - Look what I found. Looks like another setup. - Yeah, and I know who it is, too. (suspenseful music) - Hey. Maybe Davie's right. You should just call his superiors. - What good's that gonna do? They all stick together. One is as bad as the other. Come on, Rooter. - What do you want, Atkins? - Where is Bill? I want to report a prowler. - You got a problem, you see me. - I'll handle this. - [Junior] It's alright, I can sort it out. - You deaf. Move. - You dropped this last night, Bill. What did you with the rest of them? Turn 'em into board shorts. - What are ya talking about, Atkins? - You dropped this, too. It's been you all along, hasn't it? - You're in a lot of trouble-- - Why'd you do it, Bill? Why're you so dead set on nailing me? - Because me and this town are sick of what you stand for. You and all your dope sniffing mates down on the beach. You're living on borrowed time, me old mate. And this time, there'll be no more mistakes. - Well, if it's games you want to play. - Junior, arrest him. - Rooter, get the stick, get the stick. (dog growls) Stay, stay. Now, let's have a look at that leg of yours. - Get away from me, Atkins. Ouch. You'll pay for this. I'll run you out of this town. - I don't think so. You try something like this again, I'll let Rooter here chew your toes off. One by one. (dog growls) C'mon, let's go. (dog barks) - Yeah, that was pretty dumb. - Meaning what? - The guy's a cop, he can throw the book at you. - So, he's a cop. Doesn't give him the right to set me up just because I don't conform to what he wants in this one-horse town. - Listen, believe me I know. I've had enough shit from cops and other people 'round me to know exactly how ya feel, but you can't fight it like that. - You can't let him shit all over you, either. - Yeah, but in a town like this, all you're gonna do is make it worse. Even I can see that. - Hey, hey, hey, don't preach to me. Now, this is my town as much as his or anyone else's. I'll handle my problems my way, okay. - Great. And I'll handle my problems my way. Not gonna do it up here in this crookery land. - Yeah, well, your decision. Anyway, we better get back before we find any more surprises. - Remember, goanna can't change the way he walks. (phone rings loudly) - Jesus. Hello? - Is that Wandarra Police Station? - Yes, what do you want? - This is Detective Inspector Reynolds in Hunter's Hill, Sydney. I'm calling about a young man who I believe is in your area. Ross Cameron. He's staying with a Rob Atkins. - Yes, I know Atkins. Now, what kinda trouble is this Cameron kid in? (motorcycles rev) - Trouble. Motorbike gang. - I know. Just lock the door. - Aren't you gonna do anything about it? - Nope. - Why not? - This might settle all our problems, once and for all. (tires screech) - Good day, sir. We're looking for a friend of ours. - [Girl] A brother, in fact. - Goes by the name of Ross. - Yeah, I know that little prick. He's shacking up with Atkins and that black mate of his. - Atkins, eh. Where does this Atkins hang out? - South, straight through town. He's got a house on the beachfront, you can't miss it. - On the beachfront. We can't miss it. - [Weazel] Can't miss it, eh? - Weazel. You are one of us. A person of rare quality. - Hey Spags, show him how grateful we are. (bike motor revs) - Alright, kick her over. (engine grinds) That's enough, you'll flood it. - Flood it? I'll bloody drown the bitch. Good for nothing piece of shit. - That's one thing I admire about you, Waters. - What? - Your patience. (car starts) Just gotta have the right touch, see. - That old black magic, eh. - Looks like we got trouble. - [Robbie] Friends of yours? - Uh uh, wrong color. And wrong machines. - Friends of mine. - Eh? - This could be ugly. (dog barks) - Jesus, they got my girl, they got Jacky. - G'day. Figured our mate, Ross, was in the neighborhood. Thought we'd pay him a visit. A little unfinished business, Ross. - We've got nothing to discuss, except her. - Yes, very nice. She's our insurance. You remember, Skunk? He's dead. Well, it's collection time. An eye for an eye. - [Woman] And a life for a life, Rossy. (kicks and punches thud) (bikes crash, people yell) - Ross, Ross. - [Ross] Jacky. - [Robbie] Get in the car. Get in the bloody car. - Jesus. (group yells) - Who are those guys? - Come on, Waters, drive. - They've got her handcuffed, the bastards. Go. - [Davie] Watch out. - Oh. - Yeah. - [Man] Shit, c'mon. (woman screams) - [Man] Aw, shit. - [Robbie] Got some pretty strange friends. - I want him. He's mine. - [Robbie] What the hell did you do, piss on their bikes? - Real funny, no time for jokes. Have you got a gun? - No. - [Davie] Get in the bloody house. - We're stuck, we're stuck. - Quiet, cool it, cool it. - They've got my girl out there, man. - [Man] Over there. - Keys. - [Man] Go. C'mon, let's take her. (rock music) (men laugh) - Last chance, Ross. Come out now, and the girl can go free. - Hey, stay here. That won't help. - I'm waiting. - Ross, Ross. Jesus, what are you gonna do? He's got a gun. (shotgun fires) (shotgun fires) - [Man] Woo hoo hoo (laughs). - [Man] Kill the bastards. (shotgun fires) - Windows. (glass breaks) (man screams) - Yeah. - Sit down, Weazel. - Shit, it's too heavy, I'm off. - He's gone crazy. - Right-o, time to get nasty. - What's this? what are you doing? - Havin' a beer, mate. - Jesus. - You wanna settle this? Your shot. Better hurry. Go. - Cheers. - Ah. (screams) - Run, it's gonna blow. Rooter. - Robbie. - Rooter c'mon, c'mon. - Christ's sake. (loud explosion) - Yeah. (mellow music) - Jacky. (girl squeals) (laughs) - Go get 'em, Rooter. - Jesus, the bloody dog. Get in the car. Junior, get in the car. (dog barks) (pensive guitar music) - Oh, man. What are you guys gonna do now? You've lost everything. - Not quite, eh. - Well, we can always go surfin'. (rock music) - Hey, forgot the surfboard. - [Man] Woo hoo hoo hoo.
