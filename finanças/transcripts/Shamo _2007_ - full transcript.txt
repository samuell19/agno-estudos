JUVENILE DELINQUENT REFORMATORY Come on! Move it! Sit down! Sit down! Attention! Ekuni Yousuke. Assault resulting in bodily harm, and criminal vandalism. 9 months imprisonment. Fujiyoshi Kouhei. Fraud and burglary. 9 months imprisonment. Come, shave your head... Fine! I'll do it myself! Sir, please take care of this for me. And the tapes too. . . Shut up! Narushima Ryo. So you're the scum who killed your own parents? "There was a murder case today at the western district. A couple is presumed to be stabbed by their own son. They were pronounced dead on the way to the hospital. The suspect called police and claimed that he had killed his own parents. Police was dispatched to the scene right away. . . Because the suspect is a juvenile, even with sufficient evidence. . . They also believe that the suspect has the tendency to resort to violence. . . or suffers from mental illness. Experts feel that..." You're bleeding! Warden...He... They...they raped him... Beat it. With the Juvenile Protection Law, you will be released after two years. But, in this world... no one will take you in. Warden... Please...help me. . . Even the trash we've got here despises you. That's because you killed your parents. So why are you still surprised? It's not like this is the first time you've been bullied. In fact, it is some kind of a survival value. Narushima Ryo! Your sister is here to see you. Natsumi. . . Do I look thinner? A little. You've changed so much. It's pouring out there. Why did you kill mom and dad? I don't remember anything. The police told me that you did it. I dropped out of school because of it. Our relatives took our apartment and all our money. I'm going somewhere far away to work. Work as what? A hooker. I have no choice. It's all your fault. You can't work as a hooker! Sit down! I won't give you my address. Because I don't ever want to see you again. Farewell, Narushima Ryo. Natsumi! ! Natsumi! Natsumi. . . You piece of shit! You better not kill yourself. we're not done having fun with you yet! Let's go! That's him?! He's the karate instructor?? He looks more like a garbage collector. Listen up! Form a line! Form a line! ! Who has learned karate before? Give me a straight fist punch then. Those who don't know how, follow the rest. Hold it. The second one. . . 495, why aren't you moving? This is nonsense! Even a karate student is no match for me! Come over here. Hit me. This is what a straight fist punch should be. Keep practicing! Wanna learn karate? Give me your hand. Bend your fingers starting with the little finger first. Then cover them with your thumb. Put it near your waist... Rotate, and thrust! This is a straight fist punch. Try it. Rotate and thrust! Try again. Now, pair off and spar! You'll practice with 259. 259, come out! No! I can't beat him. Then how're you going to know how much energy you have in your fist? Come on, hit me. Get up. Hit me back! You wanna keep practicing the straight fist punch? You can still do it with your hands tied. Practice with heart. Practice with heart. . . When it comes to punches, progress is measured in thousands. Muscle memory starts at 1 ,000 repetitions. It becomes instinctive after 5,000. Nights are long here, so you've got plenty of time. Your whirlwind kick needs work. Do 5,000 tonight. It's too slow! Still too slow! You have to raise your knee quick and point to the lower jaw. Kick! Faster! Last time was just a misunderstanding, Brother Masa. . . Fuck off! We're not afraid of you, karate kid! You're dead meat! You must know your situation in a fight. Know whether you're going against one or ten opponents. First of all, don't try to escape. Because if you do, you will lose for sure. Whoever acts first will win. Then, try to disperse them and beat them one by one. Finally, find the strongest fighter. . . Who's usually the leader... and defeat him. Then, others will be afraid of you. Mr. Kurokawa, I would like you to help me... defeat Narushima Ryo. How to do it, you decide. Why do you need my help? Mr. Kurokawa. You may look like you live in the karate world, but, your conservative sentiments made you empathize with that "hara-kiri" author, Yukio Mishima. You worried that this country would become westernized and would die a quick death. At the time, you strongly believed that you should do something for the country. That's why you assassinated our prime minister. Protect the prime minister! Sensei Kurkgawa. . . You and I will fight. Eyes, throat, crotch...you can attack anywhere you want. You teach Narushima Ryo karate because he reminded you of yourself. You both committed an unforgivable act. You want to kill me? But Mr. Kurokawa. . . Narushima Ryo should not be allowed to live. You know that. You taught me karate. Why do you want to kill me? I can't die here. Kill him, and I can help you to leave here earlier. It doesn't make any difference. You won't survive anywhere. Just like a fighting cock. Who could have thought? You can actually live long enough to leave this place. I wonder if it is because of karate. But Sensei Kurokawa isn't as lucky as you. Because he failed to do What he was instructed to, he has been moved to a prison up north. I believe it will be a very cold winter. Are you scared? You're scared because he didn't kill me, so I will kill you. What sort of nonsense is this? Why should I be scared of you? Narushima Ryo... What are you doing? Hey, time's up. Ladies and gentlemen, once again. The L. F. reigning Champion, Sugawara Naoto! Wanna fight in the L.F. (Lethal Fight)? Who do you think you are? Nobody can beat Sugawara Naoto! But, since you're so great, maybe you can! If you win, you'll get $20 million. Then you can quit this hustler job! You'll never have what Naoto's got. Because...you are Narushima Ryo. You know what you've done. I had enough of that in prison. Nobody can look down on me again. Nobody can treat me like that anymore. Nobody. . . Narushima Ryo! Give my money to your dead parents instead! ! Or they would come back and take revenge on you!!! NATSUMI THIS MONTH'S PRETTIEST GIRL NATSUMI Is Natsumi here? Natsumi? I am Natsumi. We have only one Natsumi here. I'm free at the moment. We can just do it here. Make it quick. I'm not looking for you. Do whatever you want. Just pay me a little extra. Is there a scar? How can you hurt my face? I need to make a living. This belongs to Natsumi? Is she your girlfriend? My younger sister. How long have you been looking for her? 3 years. Did she run away from home? What's your name? Ryo. The client called and complained that you hit her. Are you nuts? This is none of your business. You think you're the boss? You're just a gigolo! They took your bracelet. That kid can fight... We can't beat him... 1 ! 2! 3! 4! 5! OK, fight! 1 ! 2! 3! 4! Go take a look. Yes. Film that kid. Get a close up on him. I recognize him. He's that psycho who killed his parents five years ago. 1 ! 2! 3! 4! 5! 6! 7! 8! 9! 1 0! Out! Here. Mr. Sugawara feels the commotion has affected his performance. After considering his complaint, We now announce that the match should be invalid. A rematch will be scheduled next month. I'm sorry, Master, for making this rash decision. I don't think you're rash. You represent the Banryu Group. Just remember that. Ryo! Ryo! Ryo... You're really shit out of luck this time. Ryo... Ryo! Sugawara Naoto... Hey, Ryo! You. . . I heard that you're a student of Kurokawa. So what? You fight well. Just like Kurokawa. I used to be his student too. So, you wanna fight? I admire you. Please come by my Dojo. He's the guy from last night! See, everyone here knows you. I bet you never thought that you'd become famous overnight. But in such a bad way. Keep practicing! Are you making fun of me? Making fun of you? If you're capable, and have the balls, I can help you win back your dignity in L. F. How can you help me? I have some recognition in the karate world. If you become my student, then you can represent my Dojo to fight in L. F.. Otherwise, you won't even get a chance to step into that ring! If I fight, it has to be against Sugawara Naoto! Of course you can fight him. You just have to do it step by step. Why did you choose me? Because we're the same. We're both Die-hards. I, Mochizuki Kensuke, am the only one Who can decide Who get into that L. F. ring. Don't salute him! YAMAZAKI RYUICHI Mr. Yamasaki is the founder of the New Banryu Group. I come here today on behalf of Banryu Group to offer our greetings. You're too kind, Mochizuki san. May I ask what the difference is between your New Banryu Group and our Group? Also, would you mind showing me your straight fist punch? If you want to... Hourglass Stance! Straight Fist! Left and right straight fist punch! Middle turnaround kick! So, the purpose of the New Banryu Group is to get beaten up. Mochizuki! You should fight someone of your own caliber! Begin! New Banryu Group, huh? Ryo. If you beat him, then I'll let you represent Banryu Group to fight in L.F. . Banryu Group has 1 20,000 students, While New Banryu Group has less than 50. And, I am the founder of Lethal Fight. You're not only a disgrace to the Banryu Group, but also a disgrace to karate. You will not be allowed to use the name Banryu Group from now on. I've only lost once. . . I've only lost once! Banryu doesn't care about the martial art spirit! You simply treated us like tools! And throw us away like garbage when we're of no use! New Banryu Group is the only true Dojo! Give it up. Or I'll make sure you can never practice karate again. I'll listen to what you have to say. But make it quick. I'm in a hurry. Listen. Don't think that you're one of ours already. As for the opponent, I'll let you know. Call me when you've figured it out. I waited here so I can give you back your bracelet! You call yourself a man?! How could you hit a woman?? I ran away from home 5 years ago. But nobody ever came looking for me. I want to be your younger sister too. Does it hurt? Like you care! Lanka is the Thai boxing champion. Ryo can never win. And, you will ruin Banryu's reputation. Ryo... it'll be perfect if Lanka kills him. Then Lanka will go against Naoto. And Naoto will win for sure. The story will be that The Banryu Group took in a murderer banished by society. And we helped him to start over. Sadly, he was killed in the ring. That way, Banryu's reputation will be restored. Better yet... I got exclusive broadcast rights to his final fight. You're so cool. Ryo! Great news! we can fight now. We got it! One punch from him and you'll be dead! If he can't kill me, then I'll beat him. Hit me. Hold on! Keep going! Hold on! Hold on. . .hold on! Hold on! You said you wanted to practice blocking! Wake up. . . Do you really think you can beat me? I almost killed you. . . Did you tell others that you're my student? I never took you in. Do you think you can win with endurance? How can you give a powerful punch with that injury? You're such an idiot. How can I teach you? I don't need you to teach me! I can't learn from you anyway! You have to wear gloves When it comes to L. F.. with them, you can never apply what you've learned. You have to learn how to attack your opponent at a specific point. What're you doing? Split the moon. Are you nuts?! How can I do that? If you can do that, then you may have a chance to defeat Lanka. You can use whatever method that works. Are you mocking me?? I can't do this!! What is this for? Use your brain. I'll do it my way as long as I can win. As you wish. Why did you insist on teaching me karate? Because it suits you. Who could've thought that you can get into fighting L. F.? You can finally prove yourself to the world! Fujiyoshi. From now on, you'll be my manager. Yeah! Ladies and gentlemen, please keep your eyes wide open to witness this special fight of the century! Are there a lot of people out there? It's a sell-out crowd. How am I today? You're so cool. Ryo, time to get on stage. Kick that bastard's ass! Narushima of the Banryu Karate Association is now entering the stadium! "The crime scene was in a wealthy residential neighborhood. The police said the suspect is only 1 6. He was still wearing a private school uniform When the police arrested him. He had the two victims' bloodstains on his clothes. The suspect seems to be mentally stable. Police also revealed that, since the suspect is only 1 6 years old, he is still under Juvenile Law protection. Even if there is substantial evidence, it will be difficult to file charges. . ." Get the hell out of here, you murderer! Just listen to the audience's reaction! One thing is for sure! Narushima doesn't seem to have any fans here at all! No one is going to forgive him for what he has done in the past! I personally have no idea why the Banryu Karate Association Would have allowed a murderer like him to enter the L. F. circle. You will win. You will win! Do we need to call Kurokawa? Please welcome the fighter of the blue corner, the strongest Muay Thai boxer, Lanka Kasamolida! He might not be very popular in the L.F. circle, but he has used his iron fists to help dozens of his family in Thailand. Just the opposite of our murderer fighter Narushima. This is definitely the fight of good against evil! In the red corner, at 1 72 cm high, and 76 kg, Narushima! Fuckin' murderer! Get the fuck outta here, bastard! In the blue corner, at 1 70 cm high and 80kg, Muay Thai figher, Mr. Lanka Kasamolida! To the center. OK. No head butting. No elbows. And no kicking to the groin. Understand? Are you two ready? Fight! You touched him! That's great! - Get away! - Get away! Lanka! Now they're back on the stage and ready to fight. You do that again, you are out! Fight! Great! Penalty! Open blow! I don't know what you're talking about. That's a palm strike. Fight! - Ryo! - Hang on! Hang on! Stop. Hang on, Ryo! You can do it! 1 ! 2! 3! 4! 5! 6! You keep counting and I'll hit you too! What's with you? Did you just let all of my training go wasted? Or are you a waste to begin with? You're a waste! All of your teachings are useless. I wouldn't have gotten through this round if I hadn't practiced my endurance! One hit is all it takes. Second round! Don't break any more rules, okay? Fight! 1 ! 2! Get him! Get him!! It's too late now. How can you have any strength when you're beaten up like that? That kick meant nothing. 7! 8! 9! Can you carry on? Are you OK? Attack his vital part with one hit. You've won! You've won! Calm down! Calm down! Come up! Come up! Take him away! We've won! ! He's won! Give him the Championship Belt! Because of that terrible accident, the judge has declared the match as invalid. What's wrong with you?! He won!! Are you fucking nuts?? What do you mean, invalid?? Did you even see the match?! Let me go... Come on! The doctors have determined that Lanka will forever lose sight to his right eye. He will be forced to end his fighting career. Even though Ryo Narushima didn't break any of the rules, he has seriously violated the spirit of the match. L.F. is not a killing field! That's why the match should be nullified. Also, I will never allow a ruthless fighter like Ryo Narushima to set foot in this L. F. ring ever again! Get down here!! Have you noticed that how much this city has changed? Did you think I wouldn't make it out? I was the one Who called the police that day. I know. Our society... can never forgive a terrorist who assassinated the prime minister. But because of Banryu, I had no choice. You betrayed me to save the Banryu group so that you can run this L.F. kid show? Sugawara Naoto is the rarest of talents. Back when I accepted him to be my student, he had nothing. And his father was disabled. A martial artist should not suffer from poverty. They should have their own social status. L.F. gives them a chance to build themselves! How noble of you. The fact is, you're using Ryo. You wanted him to die in the ring. In the end, you're the true beneficiary. There's something. . . Something you have to give me back. Well? Are you scared? You've done it, What's there to be scared of? So what if you're a star? You're just a woman. Call your boyfriend. I am Ryo Narushima. What do you want? Did you find the number familiar? Recognize this voice? Don't touch me! Get away! Get away!! That's right. Louder. So that your boyfriend will know what I've done to you. Get away! Don't touch me! Moemi! I fucked your girlfriend. Wanna fight? See you in L. F.. I'm ready now! Didn't you say we'll both do her? I didn't even touch her. What about me? Get up! Don't try to hurt your partner! Sensei! Sensei! Sensei. . . You will never see the world clearly from now on. Maybe you should start learning how to smell bank notes. Sensei, I'm sorry. Sensei, I must fight Narushima Ryo. Please make an exception. Fine. But you must kill him in the ring. What are you carving now, you old fart? There must be some ultimate move. You must teach me! What's wrong? Are you scared? Don't be. Besides, it's useless to be scared. You will lose to Naoto for sure. Bullshit! Inject this. It's some kind of steroids. But there are health consequences. First of all is the liver, then the heart. . . followed by the brain, your nerves... Delusion, depression, hallucination, psychomania. They're all there. Do you know what your only strength is? It's your animal instinct. Fight me! Come on! Fight me! I want all of you to fight me! Why don't you go help him? Don't worry. I asked them to come fight with him. He said he wanted to practice! Hello. Hello? Is that you, Mommy? It's all right. You will be fine. How can I fight Naoto with a broken arm? This wouldn't have happened had I not saved you. Always blaming the world! Can't you take responsibility for once?! Why did you bother to even get into L. F.?? What's wrong with being a gigolo? At least nobody was fucking you up! Gigolos are humans too! So you wanna beat Naoto? You can't even beat me now!! You bastard! He is your best friend! You deserve this! Ryo, what the hell are you doing? Do you want to win or what? You old fart! why did you bring me here? The match is coming up and you don't even know what you need to do. You need to overcome your fear. You need to. . .strike! That was a sneak attack! It is called a preemptive strike. Your kicks have no power whatsoever. You feel pain. Your senses are your own. You can feel it whatever way you want. Forget your injury and you will no longer feel pain. In the light, everyone can see you. That way, everybody can attack and hit you. If you keep yourself all alone in the dark, then you can do whatever you want, and no one will notice. Why did you stop?? Are you afraid of the consequences?? You got released from prison because you're dying! That's none of your business. Remember, you will always be the trash of society. A scumbag who killed his parents! Never regret. If you regret, that means what you've done is wrong. And you will never prove that...you're right. KUROKAWA KENJI NARUSHIMA RYO Natsumi. . . She was admitted because she OD'd. Some kind of anti-psychotic drugs. They don't know if she was trying to get high or kill herself. How come you were with her? Actually, I've been looking for her... For you. She was rushed to the hospital yesterday. The police told me all this. Now she doesn't even remember who you are. The doctor said she's had mental illness ever since childhood. Natsumi. . . $1 500. Deal? Don't let mom and dad know. I'm your brother. I won't. The guy who stole the drugs went down this way. That's him! Stop! Stop hitting him!! GET AWAY! Go away, daddy! Daddy, stop touching me... Do it again and I'll kill. . . Ryo! No!! After I beat Sugawara, no one will despise us anymore. In the blue corner, at 1 72 cm height, 76 kg, Freestyle fighter, Narushima! And in the red corner, at 1 85cm height, 98kg, Banryu Karate Association's heavyweight champion, Sugawara Naoto! Fight! Narushima launches into Sugawara, but can't break his perfect guard! And Narushima is down! It looks like he is having some serious trouble! 3! 4! 5! 6! 7! Stop it! Stop it! Stay back! Back to your corner! Second round! Fight! Narushima is just like Sugawara's punch bag! He can't even lift his hands! Are you OK? Stay awake! Can you hear me? I need you to stand up! Come on. Stay awake! The doctor is coming to check your wounds! Come on, sit right up! OK, stay there. Your brow ridge is broken. You should stop fighting now. I'm fine. I wanna keep fighting. Brother. . . Natsumi. . . Can you fight? OK, come on. Fight! 1 ! 2! 3! 4! 5! 6! 7! 8! 9! 1 0! ! The winner by knock out--Sugawara Naoto! Ryo! Brother. . . Ryo!
