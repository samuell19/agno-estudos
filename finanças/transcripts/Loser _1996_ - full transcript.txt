You gotta hold on here, think. Yeah, now that I think on it, yesterday started seriously fucked up. You didn't exactly wake up feeling like some way cool dude, did ya? Nah, you had one of those hangovers you wish you could just die from. - Get up, man, Chris is here. Did you drink so much, you can't even fucking wake up, man? You're gonna make the old man proud. Get up, man! - Get off! - What the fuck's wrong with you, pushing me away like that, man? Just telling you to wake up. - It's weird. Once my older brother, Brandon, and I were like this, and now we drive each other crazy. He is right about things. There just isn't anything I can do about it. The craziest story I ever heard is how our mom named us Marlon Brando Ray and James Dean Ray, her two favorite actors. You can't be any more American than that. Now we're just Brandon and Jimmy. Everything would've been different if Mom hadn't died. At least, I think so. We've always kicked back by the local airport, watching the planes take off. We even got up once with some uncle of ours, our mom's brother, or something. That was five years ago, when I was 18. Sometimes, watching the birds take off is the only way to see people get out of this piece of shit little town. Yeah, newcomers always complain about the sound of planes taking off. Me, I like it. It's comforting, and as close to heaven as I'll ever get. - Just get Chris in here, okay? - [Brandon] Yeah. Look, I'm sorry man. I guess you don't need to hear all this when you have a hangover, huh? Bro, just take it easy, all right? - Yeah, goddamn right, take it easy. I just should've last night. - Yeah, I'll just let Chris on in. Hey, maybe when I get home from school today, we can hang out, or something. At least we'll go to that party together. - [Jimmy] Yeah, maybe. - I'm not telling you your business, or anything, but if you wanna keep Alyssha as your girlfriend, you better show at that party tonight, man. - [Jimmy] Fuck that, we'll see. - Later. - [Narrator] Before all this shit went down, we had a great time, when it was just Brandon and me. He was almost as crazy as I was, almost. God, I used to look up to him, my big brother, still do. The TV always gave me ideas, hot thing to do, easy crime to commit. I guess it keeps 'em in business, I don't know. It is funny how sometimes in life things are just handed to you. - Excuse me, I wonder if you could tell me how I can get back onto the motorway. - Oh yeah, I can help you. Where you from? - From England, Gloucestershire. - Oh, uh-huh, and where's that? - Oh, it's a long way west of London. - You're from England or Ireland, or something? - A little of both, I think. - Well, there sure are enough of us here. It's a great country. - It sure is. You can show us that map, or something? - Yeah, thanks. - Yeah, why don't you put it on the hood, or something, so we can tell where you're going? - All right, thanks very much. Thanks. Thanks. - Yeah. - [Englishman] I came off here. - Oh, uh-huh? - Mm. - [Narrator] I wish I hadn't done that. It seemed funny at the time. Poor bastard probably thought he was safe with a couple of white boys. We should all be safe, but we ain't. (Englishman groaning) - Shit, bloody hell. (slow rock music) - [Narrator] Chris Hollins has been a good friend since I met him in kindergarten. Old man has always hated him for being black. He has no reason, he just does. Chris was trying to warn me. I just wouldn't listen. - Josh Brawly told me Ford Davis is looking for you, man. But I told him you were out at the kosher market, or something, man, I made some shit up. - He can't find me, man. - Dude, what's up with that? Josh said you skipped on Ford, man. I told him that ain't like you. - Yeah, well, I'll take care of it later, all right? - All right, dude. (metal clattering) (brooding rock music) - [Narrator] Yeah, I should've just pulled the covers over my head for a day, till it all flew over, but that's never been my style. I always wanted to be like my old man, Nick Ray, but it was best if we just ignored one another. He hated me, and I didn't give a shit. Maybe I did. It's sad, I wanna remember something good about him. I can't. All I can remember is his hand coming down on my face when I was too small to fight back. (melancholy rock music) - Come on, man. Come, there we go, Pop. - [Jimmy] Come on. - Oh shit, you fuck! (laughs) - [Nick] Jimmy. - [Brandon] Come on. - [Jimmy] Steady. - [Nick] He fucking spilled beer on me, the son of a bitch. - [Narrator] As much as I've hated him my whole life, that's how much now I see we're alike. - Hey, good to see you could make it up here today. - Hey, man I really tied one on last night. - Tell me, Jimmy, do you have any idea what you're doing with yourself, man? - Well, at least I ain't getting drunk here in the morning. - When I was your age, I at least had a goddamn job. I had a wife, and I had a kid. And I fought a fucking war, so don't start with me, Jimmy. - Yeah, see, I am smarter than you, right? - Why? I can see you didn't learn shit from your little visit to County, did you? - Oh yeah, I learned one thing. - What's that? - Never get caught. - Ooh. Is this the best you can do? - It's better than you, old man. - Oh, Jimmy, I don't feel like arguing this morning, so why don't you just go? Go on, get outta here. - Hey, man, you always have time for arguing. - Have a good one. - Yeah. - I got a hundred-and-something channels on this thing, and I can't get shit on any of 'em. (brooding rock music) ♪ Seems I have been a clown ♪ - [Narrator] I wasn't really worried about owing money yet. I figured I'd sell what I had, and come up with a plan for the rest. The only time I can think sometimes is when I'm driving. I have this fog over me, especially since I got out of County about a month ago. (siren blaring) What others call trouble, I've always called fun. - Okay, and then another here, over here, over here, down here, down here. - Come on, man, you patted me down before, and didn't find nothing. You know me. - Yeah, I know you. Have a seat in your favorite chair. Is this your weed I found in the car? - Yeah, it's my bud and marijuana. What's Mr. Handycam here doing? - Oh, he's from the Junior College. He's doing a short film on cops and arrest. - Shit, man, I was hoping I was gonna be on TV. - Yup, meet Jimmy, an out-of-work drug dealer, this week on "The Real World". Now, is there anything else in this car you wanna tell me about before I find it? - Yeah, I got nothing to hide, officer. - You should've just told me. - Ain't my weapon, man. - We both know you carry a weapon, you fucking scumbag. Hey, edit that part. Get a shot of his dope or gun, or something. Let's go. Fuck, get up! - No, no! - Get up! - No! - Now, fuck! You have the right-- - All right! - Let's go. - [Narrator] When you're dealing drugs, you don't have to put out the sign that most who don't last do. It's as if customers can smell you out themselves. But look at me, I fucked up. I guess we all do sometime with this. - Dave, dude, come on man! - He's not here, man. - It's Jimmy. - What do you want? - I go something for him. - Yeah? - How's it going, Krystal? - Okay. So, what do you got? - What I have. - Why don't you just give it to me, and I'll get Dave to pay you later? Come on, dude! - Nah, I need 60 bucks. - I'll give you part of the money. I'll give you 40, and Dave will pay you later for the rest. Come on. - Come on, just score me another 20. - Come on, man! Hand it over. - Nah, another 20. Come on, I need it. - Hold on. Shit, man. It's all I can do. - It's all right. So, see you later, all right? Thanks. - Okay, dude. - [Narrator] Poor Davis, I've known him my whole life. He's always been a little ahead of me, with him being Brandon's age. I hung out with him more than Brandon did, though. Ford's been dealing local shit since he was born. He farms it out. He made the mistake in spotting me. I messed up, and used the most of what he gave me. (pager beeping) (phone ringing) - [Ford] Hello? - Hey, Ford, it's Jimmy. - [Ford] Hey, Jimmy, where you been? I've been looking for you. - You know, here and there, doing business. - [Ford] Cool, we need to get together, get things straightened out. - Yeah, sure. - [Ford] You didn't use all the shit, did you, Jimmy? - What, now, who said that? - [Ford] That's what I hear. - Yeah, well, you heard wrong. - [Ford] I hope so. - It ain't about that, you know me. - [Ford] Okay, look, let's meet in the grove by the old boat in about 20 minutes, and talk about this. - Okay. - [Ford] See you there. - Yeah, see you there. - [Narrator] Looking back, I let it all go too far. Geez, why did I keep going deeper, when I was already drowning? It seems ridiculous now that I went to meet Ford at the old boat that was once our fort when we were little kids. Brandon and I used to play with Ford there. We never did know who owned that boat. Isn't that funny? - Lotta memories here, huh, dude? - Yeah. I remember, I learned about this place from you older kids, man. - This is the first place I ever got stoned, dude. - Yeah, me too. In fact, you were there. - That's why I wanted to meet here, Jimmy. It's like we all come from the same place. - From the rack? - I guess so. So, why are you packing? - Hey, man, I just didn't take it out before I came over. - Not too cool for a man who just got busted for a concealed weapon. Besides, old Brandon would kick your ass if he knew. - Hey, this ain't got nothing to do with Brandon. - Easy, dude, relax. - Hey, man, he don't know shit about what I do now. He's a schoolboy, and that's that, all right? - You've always been a temperamental kid, Jimmy. So, how are you gonna pay be me back? I mean, ain't nobody spotting me a thing, dude. - I'll get it to you. - I need it today, Jimmy. It's been too long, and too many people have been talking. - So, are you fucking threatening me? - Look, we don't have to play like this, dude. This isn't the big city, man, so we don't have to play like that. There's just not that much competition. Get the money by today. - Yeah, I'll have it by tonight. - Just don't make me look like a fool, dude. I always wondered what she'd be like on the ocean, man. - She'd be like a boat, man. - You know, you've always been a weird one, Jimmy. Maybe you're the one who should be at school, man. Some kind of philosopher, or something like that. Sure you couldn't give me a little something, dude? - Yeah, I got things going later, all right? - It's gotta be today, thought, Jimmy. Keep me informed, all right? Call me. I don't want this to become a problem. Call me. (brooding rock music) - [Narrator] I wish this was all a dream. Maybe that's all life is, is a dream. If I could wake up, then my life would start. But it's not. When did this safe place become so dangerous? You know what they say, when everything goes wrong, that's right. (heart pounding) - You're fucking nothing. Go on, cry, you little piece of shit, cry! Here, drink up, 'cause that's all the fuck there is in this life, boy. You either drink it the fuck down, or it's gonna fucking drink you down. Oh, no? Yeah, boy.

I should've followed him out of all this mess. It got a friend of ours, Frankie, killed. But I always felt like he left me, but he really didn't. It's sort of crackup to think this guy that has sold drugs and done drugs is sitting there taking a college test. Why not, right? I wish I coulda talked to him. I miss all the fun I had with him. We had such good times at the old boat. - I wanna take this boat with us, though, man. I dig this boat. It's like-- (Brandon laughing) What the hell you laughing at anyways, man? - You, man. I swear, Pop beat your ass too many times when we were growing up, dude. - Man, I used to think about all the ways I could kill him when I was little. I was too scared then, though. Most of the time, I wish I would've. - Yeah, I thought about it, too, man. I don't know, he's our old man, though, you know? Sometimes I wish he'd died in the war, and that Mom hadn't. - Fuck, man, half the time I wish I wasn't even born, you know? I got no reason for fucking anything. - No, man, you can't think like that. It'll drive you crazy. Besides, it don't do no good. Everybody thinks like that sometimes. - Yeah, but where are we going? - Anywhere but here. In fact, I tell you what. Put a hitch on your car, and we'll take this boat wherever we go, man. - Cool, we could just go till we like somewhere, you know? - [Narrator] Yeah, that boat wasn't going nowhere, and neither were we. - Hey, Jimmy. - Hey, Erica, how's it going? - What's up, you looking for Aly? - Nah. - Looking for Brandon? - Hmm-mm. - Enrolling in class? - Hey, maybe I just came to see you. - Coming to the party tonight? - Nah. - Well, then you won't see me. - Huh, yeah, see you later, all right? - That's were I'm gonna be. (brooding rock music) - [Narrator] Yeah, that's when I really should've thought of a game plan. Instead, I was headed over to Chris' to get stoned, get me to relax, help me think. Duh! - What you think, man? - Shit, it's the best in the country, man. - I'm finally relaxing, man. You want some more? - So, are you gonna tell me what's going on with you and Ford, or what, dude? - Wanna buy my car? - Just ain't got no money, man. - Yeah. Me neither, man, that's the problem. - Ah, so you do owe Ford. - Yeah, man. - Jimmy, man, don't fuck with Ford. Dude, he's out trying to make it big in this shit, man. Watch your back, dude. - Check this out, man. I'm carrying. - Shit, dude, put that thing back, man, before my mom comes back and has a heart attack, dude. I got enough problems with her thinking I'm too old to be living here and all, man. - Hey, I'm sorry, man. - It's cool. It's just, you know, she will get weird about that, man. - Yeah, your mom has always been real cool to Brandon and I. - Yeah, you guys did an awesome snow job on her, man. She says to me, "Why can't you be more like Brandon and Jimmy?" - Yeah, well, at least like Brandon. - So, how much you owe, dude? - Eight. - $800? How much you got? - Well, I got about 100 I can come up with. - You gotta come up with $700, dude? - No, man, don't worry about it. - Shit, dude, you'll get your ass kicked, man. Even worse if you don't so something about it. Ford's got too many friends to be starting that shit, man. I'll see what I can come up with, man. But you see what you can come up with, dude, and I'll fucking get you some help, man. - Man, you're fucking stoneder than me, man. - Dude, so at least I'm thinking here, man. - Yeah, all right, Super Fly. - Man, fuck you. I am trying to help you, and you get fucking racial and shit on me, man. - I'm sorry, man. - That's better, dude, show fucking gratitude. - You got any more of this shit? - Fuck, dude, I'm floating here, man. - Yeah. Well, I guess I better get up and get myself going here, and look for this money. - I'll get you half by tonight, dude. - How much is that? - I'll get you 400 tonight. - Thanks, man. - No problem.

He'd be sore if anybody said that, but he was a pretty good mom. - Hey, what are you doing in my room? - This was my room first, man. - Yeah, well, it's mine now. - No, no, I'm just letting you borrow it, man.

Immediate gratification. - Oh, man, don't give me that bullshit. - I was just fucking with you. - Yeah, I know. But next, you'll say some shit like my fucking professors about our generation again. - Hey, man, give me all the credit, why don't you? - Credit, shit, no, I ain't giving you no credit. - What the fuck is a generation, anyways? Brandon, um, I need to tell you something, man. Tonight, you know, after I see how things work out. - Yeah, sure. If you don't go to that party, then whenever, man. All right? - Yeah. - Is it good news or bad news? - Is your girlfriend going to the party? - Of course. I saw Alyssha today at school. She still thinks we're gonna get your ass there, man. - Yeah, well, you can believe in some things. It's just, I believe some things ain't ever gonna happen. - You're so fucking smart to say things like that, man. I don't get you sometimes. - Yeah, nobody does. Hey, man, don't hurt yourself. - Yeah, I'll try not. You know, things would be a whole lot easier if you'd just help me out a little, man. - Yeah, well, I learn all I need to on the radio. - [Brandon] Yeah, I guess you probably can, at that. Later. - Yeah. (Jimmy laughing) - [Narrator] If I ever was to be a father, I'd never say half the stupid things my father has said to us daily while growing up. It's just some shit that will never end if some just don't stop it. (Nick laughing) - Oh, man, I don't want no fucking niggers in my house. Not in my fucking house!

We were always playing cowboys and Indians, and stuff. Reality hit when a friend of ours died, messing with all the same stuff we were. Frankie OD'd, some said it was suicide. I can't say I haven't thought of it too. I never cried so hard in my whole life. But instead of going like Brandon, who turned his shit around in a heartbeat, I just got deeper. I started using all my own stuff. I haven't been clearheaded for so long. What good is it anyways? I should've done it like Brandon, and got the hell outta Dodge. I went around that afternoon and called on every favor I could, borrowing money to pay for borrowed goods. I came up with $350, and with Chris' half, I should've been home free. I thought Ford would even spot me the cash. Yeah, I just never took to being threatened very well.

I mean, it's a whole nother thing, dude. Dude, maybe we can have Brandon talk to him. - No, no, man. I can't fucking bring Brandon into this shit again. I'm always bringing him into this. - But that's your brother, though, man. I mean, he should be able to do something. - Lay off, all right? - Yeah, sure, man.

I got some help from those who coulda helped me out of this. Shit, everybody gets in over their head sometime. - You're not really thinking about carrying your gun to the party, are you, Jimmy? - Hell, no, man, I'm just making my bed. - Uh-huh. Shit, I know this makes you uncomfortable, man, but she is your girlfriend, and besides, Chris and I will be there. What could happen? Dude, something like bringing a gun to a party, and you're bound to find trouble. Shit, it might even find you. - Yeah, what could happen? - I know you're still mad at me for going to school, man, but one of these days, we gotta talk this out. Something's going on with you. I know it and you know it. Still, you won't tell me. - Come on, I said, later, let's talk. - Well, it should be a good party tonight, man. - Yeah, well, any party's a good party. - You got any money on you for tonight, man? - No, not very much. - Now, don't go weird on me now. And don't sweat that, I'll catch the beer tonight. (heart pounding) (Jimmy coughing) - Hell, the only time it matters what people talk about you is when you die. Do you wanna know what they'd say about you if you died today, huh? They'd say you're a fucking loser. A smart-ass, fucking slopping dressing, slacking, no-good fucking drug-dealing loser. (heart pounding) (Jimmy coughing) (upbeat music) - Yeah, Brandon, man, you said you were gonna introduce me to Erica when we get to that party, man. - Yeah, man, I'll take care of it. - Hey. - Thanks. - Ladies first. - Yeah, well, get your ass in the car then. (engine roaring) Yo, man, listen to this, I love this song, man. (upbeat rock music) Hey, man, keep your beers down. I don't need to get no DUI, man. - Yeah, Jimmy, you gotta watch getting a DUI. - You guys are crazy. Just keep your beers down, all right? - Hey, Brando, why don't we just go up to the hills, and have a few beers, fuck the party? - No, man, we do that, we'll have a couple of chicks really pissed off at us when we show up, man. - Hey, hey, hey, Jimmy. You tell him yet, dude? - Tell me what, man? - Hey, it's nothing. - No, come on, tell me what? Look, some bullshit's been going on all night, man. Tell me what? Look, you can't tease me like that, man. - It's nothing, dude. We just got ahold of this, this huge doobie today, man. We smoked it this afternoon, homes, it's nothing. - Yeah, right. ♪ Do right, you do right, do right, you do right ♪ ♪ Right, you do right, do right, you do right ♪ ♪ Do right, you do right, do right, you do right ♪ ♪ Do right, you do right ♪ - Man, let's kill these beers, and get in there. - I knew there was something good about summer. All the women wear less. - Dude, there's nothing more beautiful than women in bathing suits, man. - Yeah. - I mean, a naughty one, too. - Yeah, I think I'd rather have my women naked in the pool. - Dude's got a point there, man. - Naked women in a pool, man, that's hot. (engine revving) - Well, what do say we do this thing, huh? Tell you what, why don't you put the empties in the bag back there, and I'll take in the rest of the beer. - Oh, yeah, Brandon gets the good stuff, man. We get to carry empty bottles. - Yeah, well, that's 'cause I'm older, man. - Dude, you're a mean old man. - Well, if you guys are good, I'll let you share some. (upbeat rock music) - Will you stop worrying, he's gonna be here. - I know, yeah, yeah, I know, I know. I don't care, it doesn't matter. - He's even been pretty cool lately. I mean, he took us to lunch last week, and he gave you a card. - Well, that sounds really good to me. And Brandon will make sure he comes anyways. Chris is never gonna miss a party. - That's true. - I just think something's up with Jimmy, you know? Something wrong. I just feel it. - Listen to her, she can just-- - Shut up! (girls laughing) - Wait, she's got a fluke coming down into her. (girls laughing) He's gonna be here. - I don't care, I don't care. - It has been nice lately, huh? - Sorry, Jimmy, you think I'm stupid. - No, that's all right, thanks. - Hey, how's it going, Chris? - Hey, it's going great, Kim. - Oh, I'm sorry, Erica, this is Chris, Chris, this is Erica. - Hi, nice to meet you. - It's good to meet you. - [Erica] I've heard a lot about you. - Thanks. I hear there's gonna be a really cool band playing tonight. - [Erica] Yeah, they're supposed to be really good. They're gonna start in a few minutes. - Well, this is a cool party. - Yeah. (laughs) - Does anybody need another beer? - Yeah, I could go for one. - Yeah, let's get another beer. - I'm up for that. - So, is everything okay? You just seem a bit uptight. - Yeah. - You didn't even call me, though. - Well, I was busy. - Do you wanna talk about it? - Look, later, okay? - You okay with all these strange people you don't know? - Yeah, well, they are kinda strange. - You're strange. - Thanks. It's a nice party you got going here, you know? Your parents are pretty nice to do this. - I'm old enough, and they trust me. - Why? - Yeah, well, what they don't know won't hurt them, right? Don't you think? - Yeah. - [Narrator] Nobody appreciates life till it's taken away from them. We don't treat it with love, respect, you know? I knew big trouble was coming, trouble that I made myself, my own worst enemy. And watching all these people seeming to have so much fun, I wondered why I always felt alone, an outsider. Thinking about it, maybe I was wrong. Maybe we're all outsiders, maybe we're all alone. Maybe the beauty is those very few moments we're not. (gunshot banging) (brooding rock music) (upbeat rock music) - What are you doing smoking that? Will you hurry up and finish that off, please? - I'm sorry. I'm mean, we were having a few beers. I thought it'd be a nice time to get stoned. - Well, I'm sorry, but, you know. - It's cool, I mean, like, you're not into that scene. - Well, it's just-- - No, that's not it. - She's just concerned that the cops will show up, or something. - Well, the cops aren't gonna bother you too much about one joint. It's how many people here have them. - See, now, that's what makes me nervous, you know? I mean, look at all these people here. - Just kidding. As long as you're not selling, you don't have to worry about it. - Yeah, we'll see. - Which is good anyway. - Cool. - Just don't do it here, you know? Did you talk to him? - Where's Jimmy? - I think he's playing pool, I think. - He seems really sad. Is there something wrong with him? - Nah, he'll be all right. - He's okay. - I hope that it's not me that's making him act that way. - It's not, you know that. It's just, we haven't totally gotten along in a while. But I don't even think it's me that's bothering him. It's something else. - He won't talk to anybody. - [Brandon] He's a survivor, he'll make out whatever it is. - Man, I can't be quiet anymore, he's, he's-- - He's what? - [Brandon] Chill, man. - Yeah, it's getting pretty fucked up. Thanks, bro. - Anytime, man. - Here. - Sorry, Jimmy. - I need a soda, or something.

It's like you're mad at the world, or something. - It's not you, all right? - Well, I'm glad you're not leaving me. - Stop it! God! That's always the fucking answer? - Well, I can't believe I'm standing here telling you, "I don't know what I'll do without you," and you say, "Stop it." - I don't want you to depend on me forever. - You're so fucking cruel. - I don't want you to depend on me forever. - I open myself up to you, and you just slam the door shut. I'm just a piece of ass, aren't I? - No, that's not it. That's not it. - Why do I stand here and listen to you? Do you know how many guys would kill to be with me? - Hell, I'd kill to be with you, too. - Well, you're not making any sense, Jimmy. I'm confused, do you like to confuse women, is that it? - No, that's not it. Hell, I don't even know what's going on, I mean... A lotta shit. - What? - A lotta shit's... I don't know. - Great. - I'm sorry, okay? - Yeah. - You're so temperamental. - Screw you! - Yeah? - You wanna spend the night with me, Jimmy? - You want me to? - Yeah. What's wrong? - I gotta go somewhere with Brandon to make this, all this shit turn out right. I'll come back, though. - Good. It's gonna be okay. - So, why don't you talk to me? - Hey, man, I owe Ford money. - What for, shit? Hey, why are you messing around with a loser like that? - I don't know, man, I was trying to make some money. - Don't sound like it. How do you deal and owe, Jimmy? - 'Cause I was buying more than I was selling, man. I don't know, man. This fucking shit, it got way outta hand, you know? And you've been going to school, and shit. - No, fucking don't blame this shit on me, man, all right? - I'm not. - Well, how long you owed Ford then, huh? - Hey, man, I kept thinking I'd get ahead of it, and it got way ahead of me. - Why didn't you come to me, man? - Hey, you know we haven't been close for a long time. - Yeah, maybe, but I am your fucking older brother, huh? - Yeah. - So, what, you been using since I went to school? - No, I've been using since Frankie killed himself. - Man, why? - I don't know, man, maybe I fucking like how it makes me feel, you know, or doesn't make me feel. What, man, fucking look at me. - I'm fucking looking at you, don't fucking be like that. - You fucking worried what other people are gonna think? - Don't fucking be like that, all right? - Fucking worried they're gonna say I buy and sell cocaine? - I don't give a shit about anybody else. So, how bad is this with Ford, man? - Yeah, well, it's real fucking bad. - All right, how much do you owe him, then? - Hey, man, that's not all there is to it, right? - All right, well, what else then, huh? - Hey, wait a second, man. - What? - Hold on. What? - Fuck. - What, man? You wanna fuck with my girl. - Hey, Jimmy, please! - Out of my way! (lively rock music) - Hey! - Cut it out! - [Alyssha] Wait, no, Jimmy! Please, stop it, stop it! - [Man] All right, come on, right now, right now, let's go! - Can you tell me why you did that? - Hey, what am I supposed to do? - A lotta guys would just be proud, you know, it takes two. Man, I didn't do anything. Gimme some credit. - Forget it, man. - You can't just do stuff like that! - Hey, leave me alone, man. - [Narrator] I almost never cry. I just bite the bullet, however hopeless it is. I mean, how hopeful is a drug dealer after all? I can't make excuses. Why me, God? Why couldn't I have been rescued from all of this?

I wish I could do it again; I'd do it different. I just realized, the big joke is, we all wanna be immortal, and then die. What about living our time here? God, forgive me. - Mom? Fuck it. Take the money in my pocket, and spend it on your kid. - [Woman] No, don't go. (melancholy rock music) - [Narrator] Death beckoned, and I answered the call. It ain't fair, but it's not so bad.
