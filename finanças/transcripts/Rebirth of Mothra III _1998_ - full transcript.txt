Have hope as long as you live... Mothra 3 Invasion of King Ghidorah Wisdom. Courage. Love. Belvera, what are you doing? Moll... Garu Garu! Moll. Lora. You must have heard of this Alias triangle. The secret power which protects us Alias. But nobody knows what or where it is. You didn't want to know. We didn't need it. Not before now, anyway. What have we here? I'll take it. Fairy! Might as well keep them. The king of terror is... What is it? It says "wisdom". Here. This one says "courage". Courage and wisdom? Lora, give me that. It won't fit. It'll fit Belvera's sword. But the one she took? Will fit yours. What now? What Belvera said. The king of... Terror. The king of terror is coming. Here you are! What's the matter? They look afraid. Of what? Shota, come here for a minute. Try that. Well? Good? More spice. Ah, Shota... Squeeze a lemon. Chop the onion finer. Sure. It's dad! Welcome home! I'm back. This is for you. Come. I'm home. Hello, dear. Wow! Where did you get it? It was Tanaka's gift. Oh, great! Come here. Strong! Tired? No. Drink. Nice chaser, huh? Try this. Good. Who's idea? Shota. Shota. How did you know I'd like it? Imagination. Imagination? It's a night of shooting stars. Shooting stars?! To Aoki forest. Take care of yourselves. Don't forget this. Shota? Your lunch. Thank you. No mustard on yours. Shota... I'm sure some day you'll be ready to go to school. Well, take care. You know what's happening here. What? Shota's skipping school. Of course not. Then why? I don't know. He has his own idea. I know why he skips school. Why? Like this girl in my class. She eats school lunches crying. Crying? She must eat everything, even if she doesn't like it. But it's healthy to eat right. To eat what she doesn't like? If she does, she isn't true to herself. Here comes the bus! Shota, don't forget to go to Aoki forest today! Bye dad! See you dad! Ok! Have a good day! Not a simple meteorite. From outer space? It belongs to Earth. Like oil, an extract of something. Fairy. Dinosaurs? An essence of dinosaurs. They died millions of years ago. 130 million years ago, they all perished? How can it be here? It returned. It killed the dinosaurs 130.000.000 years ago. It survived 200 million years. King Ghidorah. King Ghidorah. Where are all the children? It killed dinosaurs before. But this time... We must call Mothra. Moll... They must be in there. Hurry, Mothra. Look! What's wrong? Hold on! You ok? Lora! Tamako? Tamako? Tamako? Let's get out. Tamako! Get away! That was close. King Ghidorah creathed them. King Ghidorah? Why are you here? Why? My sister is there. King Ghidorah gathered children and locked them in that dome. Gathered children?! What for?! Well... To kill. I'm Moll. This is Fairy. You? Sonoda. First name? Sonoda, Shota. What's wrong? My sister is there too. Where are they? Have you seen them? Excuse me, teacher. What happened to my children?! I'm hearing strange news on TV! The radio said all children have disappeared from school. So are Tamako and Shuhei! Teacher?! Take it easy! Not only your children. All children are missing. 528 of them. It's not only our school, it's happening everywhere! The strange dome that appeared in Aoki forest... the missing children are there. Police headquarters' men saw the children moving inside the dome. Shota can get there through his secret cave. Lora has a gentle heart. King Ghidorah took advantage of her kindness. Kind hearts are easy to exploit. How awful. It's terrorable. I knew that without Lora's heart or mine, Mothra's power would be reduced. This way. Do you come here often? Wind cave. A trace of lava. A labyrinth. It's where I like to play. The other? You said three sisters. My sister... Won't she help you? She's cross, the oldest child has a more difficult time than the younger ones. What's that smell? That's Mothra. Don't worry, it can tell good from evil. Shota... Go. His bicycle is gone! He went to the forest! Hurry! Lora. Lora. What are you doing here? It's dangerous. King Ghidorah is terrorable. He plans to destroy the Earth. Lora? Have you lost your mind? Lora, what will happen to Mothra? He never told me he came here. He's like a wild animal. Over there! You stay here! Wait for me here, understand?! Let's go. King Ghidorah is returning. Now what? What's the plan? What? Mothra's trying to speak. Moll! Moll! What did he say?! What did Mothra say?! There is a way. Only one way to stop it. Great! But we can't do it! Do what? Mothra wants to go to the past. The past? 130 million years ago. The time when King Ghidorah first came. Well? Will he go? King Ghidorah was a baby then. Mothra can beat him. Thousands of massacres took place. King Ghidorah was responsable for half of them. Besides... Lora's gone. I asked Mothra to wait for her. He wouldn't listen, he knows he can't return. He can't? But it must be done. No matter how I feel, I must do it. That is my duty. Mind can reach... When arms cannot, mind can. Mind can reach. Through walls. Even time? Moll! What's the matter?! Moll! He got there. Come on. He'll beat King Ghidorah. I have a request. Lora is in the dome. Mothra needs her power to defeat King Ghidorah. Shota... Me?! I can't. Lora loves children. You can persuade her. I can't even go to school. No guts. You're careful and sensitive. You can't stand by anything bad. Take it. Take it with you. It'll help you. But... Shota... Thank you. Courage, huh? Totally useless. Hold it! Just a moment. I'm getting ready. No matter how hard, I must do this. Look here! Here I am! Why don't you take me too?! Lora! Tamako! Shuhei! Shuhei! Tamako! Mothra's attack is working. Lora! Lora! Don't come closer! Don't go! Lora, help Mothra! Help him! Do it for Moll! No, Lora. If you kill a human being, it is the end. Lora, don't do it. Lora. It was her last request. Last? Lora. Moll told me you love children. Please save them. So that's it. Give me the sword. Courage, wisdom and love. The three together create a super power! Not courage or wisdom alone. The three of them together... that's the Alias triangle! Where's Lora?! Hurry! Mothra's losing the fight! Lora. Encourage Mothra. Yes! You're safe. The monster? Mothra beat it. Mothra? Moll. Moll sacrificed herself... To send Mothra to the past. Strange. If King Ghidorah died, then history should have changed. The dome is gone. If history changed, we wouldn't be here. Not dead! Survived! Mothra? Where's Mothra?! Gone. Mothra's gone forever. Fairy! Belvera. Lora. We must fight for ourselves now. The Alias triangle represents ourselves. Ourselves? Moll for wisdom. Lora for love. And me for courage. Our opinions differ, but that's ok. Belvera. Let's go! Lora, tenderness isn't enough. We have hate and anger! If you know why, love glows stronger than courage or wisdom! Mothra's back! How could he come back? Time capsule. A trip in time 130.000.000 years. He made it in a few hours! We know how to use this, but... Is it true? What's Mothra saying? The sword. To Moll. Moll. Moll! It's true. Arms didn't reach, but mind did. Hear that?! He said "Thank you"! Great Shota! Don't mention it. So what. We don't always agree with each other. Garu Garu! Hi there.
