Summer's over WITH MAKE-UP & HAIR SET DESIGN COSTUMES PRODUCTION SOUND SOUND DESIGN ORIGINAL SCORE EDITING CINEMATOGRAPHY SCRIPT PRODUCER DIRECTING - How are you, Mircică? - Good, mister Ilie. You? Trying to survive the heat. It hasn’t been this hot since the summer of 1954, ever since that drought. - The pond dried up and- - And the cows were dying of thirst. - I know, you’ve told me. - So what? I’m telling you again. What? Nothing. Come here, Mircică. Oh, mister Ilie, you’ve found it! Thank you. I bookmarked the eclipse for you. So, what does it say? Well, it explains how the eclipse will take place. And look, this is just a few moments before it will be covered completely. It’s called “the diamond ring”. You see? Don’t worry, I’ve seen eclipses before. - You have? - Of course. You think this is my first one? I saw one in 1961, when I got back from the army. And you watched it just like that? You need special equipment. What special equipment? I smoked some glass with a candle and watched through it. And when it got dark, you’ll see, it gets as dark as night, all the old women got really scared. They started crossing themselves and screaming that the Russians are coming. - The Russians? - That’s another story. Go on, read. What does it say? Solar eruptions, prominences and loops. Coronal eruptions, prominences and loops are all magnetic manifestations of our star. That’s the Sun. - Where were you? - With mister Ilie. Geo! What? Come. - What’s this? - It’s an astronomical atlas, from mister Ilie. Mister Ilie says he saw an eclipse once, and that it gets as dark as night. Fantastic. Go see what your father’s doing. He’s watching TV. Geo, come on! Oh, come on, Geo. The food’s getting cold. Yes, I’ll be right there. Yes. Hi! We were just eating. Tonight, why? Oh, OK. Yeah, of course, don’t worry. OK, bye. - Who was that? - Rodica. She wanted me to go give Mrs. Pârcălăbescu her shot. Want some more? Get out of here! How is it going to explode? It’s not a bomb. No, mister Ilie, it really is kind of a bomb. Nuclear fusion takes place in the centre of the Sun, that’s why it’s releasing heat. And one day, it’s going to swell up and explode. - It says right here in the atlas. - When is it going to explode? The scientists estimate that in about five billion years. - Billion! - Yes. You think we’ll live billions of years? The scientists say that until then human kind will move to other planets. - What other planets? - Ones suitable for life. You’ll never find anything more suitable than Earth. Can’t you see? They’re searching the whole Universe, the Russians, the Americans, the Japanese. And did they find anything? They found squat. What are you doing here? - The bicycle. - Wait. - Hold on. - Thanks. - You’re the bomb, man. - What do you mean? - I mean thanks. - Don’t mention it. Peace out. - It means bye. - Oh, OK. Mirciulică, can you help me? Bye, mister Ilie. Grab one handle. It’s heavy. Hey, didn’t you say you were coming on the 3:30 bus? Did you think I’d wait for an hour in the bus station? City hall called. The engineer’s coming to sign the papers. Really? The Canadians are building you a supermarket. You don’t say. - How are you, Mircică? - I’m fine. Fine. - Did you buy any Gillette II? - I forgot! - Oh, come on, Cecilia… - What? I forgot and that’s that. - How’s your father? - At work. You tell him this: that Toader asked when are we going to throw a fatty into the water? - What fatty? - None of your business. Oh, come on. A Cotnari Fatty. You tell him that. When are you going to throw a fatty into the water? Good. - I’m off. - Bye. How was business today? Do you want a Granita? Hey, wait up! Help me out, man. I think I’m lost. - What street are you looking for? - General Draganina, I think. Dragalina. It’s close by. I think I took a wrong turn. I haven’t been here for four or five years. - Alex. - Mircea. Grab the bike. My backpack is killing me. I don’t know how to ride a bicycle. What do you mean you don’t know how? Never mind. Walk beside it. Come on. - Give me a sip. - Take it all. - So, where to? - This way. Oh, man… Let’s go. - Where are you from? - Colentina, Bucharest. Colentina or Bucharest? Man, Colentina’s the most badass neighbourhood in Bucharest. You’ve never been to Bucharest before, have you? No. Bucharest’s like this. If you know the right people, it’s cool, funky. If not, you’re fucked. Just like everywhere else. How long will you stay here? Don’t know. Till my dad comes. He said he’ll take me and go to the seaside to have fun. - Where is your father? - In Italy. We’re here. Yeah, man. This is it. Grandma! Grandma! Hold this. Give me the bike. - Aren’t you coming in? - No, I’m going home. What the hell are you doing home? Come in! Come! Oh, my baby, where were you? I’ve been waiting for so long. You’ve grown so big and handsome! - What’s with the long hair? - It’s the fashion. - And who’s this? - A friend. Mihai. - Mircea. - Right. Mircea. - Mircea who? - Mircea Ionescu. Really? Your aunt said you were coming alone. No, grandma. Mircea’s from around here. >From around where? I live in Trust, in those four storey buildings. Come on, grandma, don’t you remember Mircea? We used to play around here when we were little? - Really? - Really. Come. I made cabbage rolls. They’re probably cold. Help me out. - Do you like hip hop? - What’s that? Come on, man… really? Check this out. Listen to this. - One day I’ll do that too! - Yeah, right. You can’t even ride a bike. No way. - What? - You can’t even ride a bike. You have to learn how to ride a bike first and then do tricks like me. Paraziții? B.U.G.? Yeah, man, B.U.G. If you’re set on coming at me I’ll fry you on the spot Just to feel better. - Do I leave this here? - Yes. Hello. Did you come for the glasses again? Two Granita, please. Apple, right? Listen, do you have any McDonalds here? - KFC? Spring? - What’s „Spring”? Man, I’ll starve around here. Thank you. Bye. Why’s everything so deserted around here? I don’t know. It’s quieter here. Quieter? It feels like a cemetery. Bucharest’s full right now. - I’m going this way. - OK, cheers! Are you coming around my place tomorrow? Sure. What time? I don’t know. After you wake up. Around two. OK, then. Goodbye. You’re so cheesy, man. Peace. Hi, Radu. Hi. Can we play? Gică! Can these two play? You wanna play? Go fetch the ball. Stay here. - Who are you supposed to be? - Who am I… Yeah, who the fuck are you? Hit him! Hit him! Let him go! What? You’re a wise guy too? It’s their fight. He’s getting up! He’s getting up! Alex! Go fetch the ball. He’s bleeding… He deserves it. And don’t come back without a haircut. Did you hear me? Did you hear me? Does it hurt? What, this? This wasn’t a fight. We shoved each other a little. You should see what happens in Bucharest if you mess with the wrong people. That’s a real fight. But, anyway, my dad’s coming soon and he’ll take me to the seaside. - Are you coming back? - What for? To hang out with all these losers? No, thanks. I’d rather stay in Bucharest, hang out with the right people. Maybe you can visit me sometime. I don’t think my parents will let me. Why not? What are you, a child? - How old are you, fourteen? - In a few days. See? When you're fourteen you’re gangsta. You even have an ID. You don’t give a damn. We’ll go to McDonalds. I’ll take you to Spring. Come on, man, it will be fun. - What will your mum say? - My mum? My mum left. - So, who are you living with? - With Angela, my dad’s sister. But she’s usually away. She comes by once every three or four days and she’s like: “Everything OK?” “Yeah.” “Got any more money?” “No.” Doh! So she gives me some money, takes a bath or whatever and leaves. And I’m the sheriff of the house again. Get it? Mircea, what time did I tell you to come home at? I stayed a bit longer. Take off your shoes. - Hello. - Hi. Who are you? - Alex. - A friend. - What happened to your lip? - It’s nothing. - Let me get you some ice. - No, don’t worry, I’ll be fine. - Are you sure? - Yeah, of course. Suit yourself. - Hello! - Hello. You’re not from around here, are you? - No, he’s from Bucharest. - I’m visiting my grandma. - Does she know you’ll be late? - No, I didn’t want to take a detour. - You can call her. - It’s no use. She doesn’t hear the phone. She’s always watching telenovelas. I have to go. I’m on guard. If you’re hungry, there’s something in the oven. OK? Behave. - Do you have a box? - A what? A boom box. To listen to some music. Hold on. - What are you doing with that? - We want to listen to some music. - Put it back afterwards. - I will. Oh, cool! For all those who get on my nerves I’ve got just one thing to say Shut it. For all those who won’t let me hope I’ll give you hood voices, with hood language That’s right. I’m a thick skinned man Fuck your mother and your father and your brother too Listen to this. Listen here, you so called poet to what I’m about to say on this verse With blow jobs and dicks and cunts and assholes Yo, man! What are you doing? - What was this? - What? What I heard earlier. What was it? - Nothing. - Nothing? Mircea, I will only tell you once. God forbid I ever catch you with filthy music like that. And leave the door like this. Open. - Are you insane? - Come on, man, where is it? Jesus… What did you do, man? - Oh, come on… - I’m sorry. - You have to check this out, man. - What? Come on. Half an hour. Come here, man. So, you’re on a mission, OK? You have to kill the others. Forward, backwards, left, right. Crouch. You change weapons and jump with this one. You shoot with this, OK?

Straighten the handlebar. Good job, man! - Good, man! - I did it, man! Now, come back. Pedal. Good. Keep the handlebar straight. Keep it straight! Hey! Hit the brake, man! What did you do? Jeez… Come on, get up. You’ll be fine, don’t worry. Fuck! Didn’t I tell you to keep the handlebar straight? Let’s go. You OK? You messed up my brakes, man. Grandma, didn’t I tell you to sit by the phone in case dad calls? I’ve got other things to do. Come on. Here. - You’re worse than a woman, man. - It hurts! - Gran, got an allen? - What’s that? Come on, you don’t know what an allen key is? Really, now… A bicycle is all you needed. It’s hard learning how to ride it, Mircică. First, you put two little wheels on each side on the back wheel. Until you learn. Come on, mister Ilie, you said you’d cut my hair. Five minutes. Five minutes and I’ll cut it. Hit the break. Good. Take it for a ride. Help me out. - How is it? - Cool! - Thank you very much, mister Ilie. - You’re welcome. And be careful. I don’t want to find out you cracked your head open too. Let’s go get the bike, man.

No, forget it. - Let’s do something else. - What? I don’t know. Let’s go for a swim. Cool! Come on. Listen, can we bring someone with us? - Who? - A girl. Uuuh! What girl? A girl. Ioana. Is she your girl? So, did you guys kiss? Are you crazy? Then what do you do when you meet? I don’t know. We read, we talk. That’s it? Let's go. Mircea! Get in already! Yo, what are you doing? We’re having fun, right? Really? What if I push you under water too? What are you doing, man? How long can you hold your breath? What do you mean? Under water. I don’t know. Watch this. What if he drowned? Mircea! Mircea! Where is he? Man, how do you do that? - I’m taking you somewhere else. - Not at the mill, I hope. - What mill? - Mircea, I’m not going in. I’m scared. What are you talking about, man? Look. This is so cool, man! Check this out. Really cool… Hey, what’s this? - It stinks! - Close it! Let’s check this out, man. - It’s dark. And possibly rats. - What are they gonna do to you? - I’m not going down there. - Suit yourself. Oh, killing spree! Alex? Alex! Come down, already. Mircea, a rat! What are you doing, man… Jeez. - Where were you? - Outside. Outside. Where outside? Your dad went looking for you around the block but couldn’t find you. What’s this? I borrowed it from Alex till tomorrow. Filthy music again? - Did you go to the Danube? - Why? What? What do you mean why, Mircea? You know you’re not allowed to go there by yourself. - I wasn’t by myself. - With who, then? With some friends. With that boy, you mean. What’s wrong? Your son went to the Danube by himself. I wasn’t by myself. Listen, if there were no adults with you, then you were by yourself. - To the Danube, where? - Behind the bridge. Come on, the water’s shallow there. So what? There’s potholes and currents there. Those crosses on the bank are for little kids who thought the water’s shallow, too. Do you know how many cases like that come in at the hospital daily? And you come back so late, too, have me worried to death. Other children don’t have a curfew. Mircea, I don’t care about other children. I don’t want to see you hanging around with that Alex anymore. Did you hear me? You’re grounded! How many times have I told you to close the fridge door? I wanted to eat something. I see you’re drinking water right now. Well, yes, but I wanted to eat afterwards. Don’t leave the house. Your mother’s still angry with you. - Hello, is Alex home? - No. - Do you know where he is? - No, I don’t. He left this morning slamming the doors and hasn’t returned yet. Ok. If you see him, tell him to calm down and come eat. Yes, yes. Hey... I’ve been looking everywhere for you. - He’s not coming. - Who? Who… He does this every time. He says he’s coming and he actually isn’t. He can’t take days off, shit like that… And here I am, waiting for him like an idiot, instead of minding my own business. Is your mum in Italy, too? Who? Your mother. You said she left. They’re divorced. When dad left for Bari, he first went by himself. Then he said he’d take us, too. But before he did, he found someone, my mother found out and that was that. Don’t you talk to her anymore? I do, but rarely. Fuck it, let’s talk about something else. No, keep it some more. Come on, he’ll come. - Who? - Your dad. Yes. Hello, is Mircea home? Listen… - I forgot your name. - Alex. Right, Alex. Alex, I don’t know how your parents raised you in Bucharest, - but it’s almost 10 o’clock. - Two minutes, please. It’s almost 10 PM. And this is a respectable home, OK? You don’t just come by and knock whenever you feel like it. And please stop putting stupid ideas into my son’ head. He’s got better things to do than hang around with you all day long. Is that understood? - Good evening. - Hi. Can I talk to Mircea? - At this hour? - It won’t take long, please. Mircea! What? Come here a bit. - I see your lip has healed. - Didn’t I say it would? Look, there’s someone here for you. - Alex! - Hi. Come on, five minutes. Mircea, please give him the cassette player back, too, OK? Don’t leave the building. Come here, man. So, check this out. I have an idea. What? - I want you to kidnap me. - What? To kidnap me. And then we’ll send a letter to my dad so he gives us money. And afterwards we go to the seaside, to McDonald’s. We get a bike, a computer, anything you want. - Are you in? - So, I do what? So, it’s like a… a set up, man! And we get cash. What set up? So, you pretend you kidnap me. And then we send a letter that says I’m kidnapped, and ask for money. And that’s it. But why do it? Well… come on, it’ll be fun, what’s wrong with you? - What if he doesn’t believe us? - Why wouldn’t he? What if he calls the police? Why would he? What’s wrong with you, man? We write that if something goes wrong, bam! His son gets it. It sounds dangerous. Man, what do you mean dangerous? Let’s try it and we’ll see. If something happens, we just switch it and say it was a joke. Come on. - I don’t know, I have to think about it. - Think about what? - I don’t know, to think. - Man, I knew you’d shit your pants. Come on, this is your last chance. - I said I have to think about it! - Fuck you, man! Hey, what’s up? What? I came to write the letter. Seriously? Is your grandma home? She’s at church. Cool. - “Send the”. Do you have “send”? - Yes. “Send” and “the”. OK. “Money” I thought I saw this one somewhere. Here. And “urgently”. We have to clean up before the hag gets back, OK? It won’t take long. Shouldn’t we just write it by hand? Are we professionals or just playing around? But I can write really professionally. It doesn’t matter; they can tell it’s a child’s writing. So we waste time looking for words in a newspaper? That’s that. How long does it take for the letter to reach Italy? Normally, about 3-4 days. Why? Cause we have to calculate precisely. Why? So we know when he’s coming with the money, right? You didn’t think about all this too much, did you? Man, what’s to think about? You send the letter, he comes with the money and that’s it, I’m free. What if he calls your grandma or the police? Man, you’re killing me with all this police talk! Why can’t you understand they can’t do anything even if they catch us? Cause we’re not doing anything wrong. OK, man, fuck the police. - What did you say? - What? About the police. I don’t know. Fuck’em. That’s my bro! Talking and thinking like a gangsta. Whatever. Let’s resume. Let’s say your dad believes us. When does he bring the money? Where? How do we make the swap? There are lots of things. Well, we tell him to bring the money in four days, at the mill. Cause it’s good to get him to some place deserted. Four days after he gets the letter or after we send it? Man! Why do you always have to have the last word? OK, fine. So, four days till the letter reaches Italy, another two to get hold of the money and another day so he can take the plane and get here. Right? Right, man? OK, we’ll do it this way. Let’s get the camera. Hey, where are we going? Come on, it’ll be cool. Listen. If you don’t tell me where we’re going, I’m turning around and going home. We want to enter a horror photos contest, get it? And we were thinking of taking them in a cool place. Where? You’ll see. Please. Five minutes and I’ll bring it back. - Do I have your word? - You have my word. I’ll time you. Five minutes, that’s all. Thanks. Sit down over there. Give me your hands. - What are you doing with those? - Painting some blood. Cool, man! No, man, this is not OK! I can see you’re faking it. - You have to look terrified! - OK. Mircea! Open up. Mircea! Mircea, come on already! Wait, I’ll be right back. Ioana, wait! Please, wait! You gave me your word, Mircea! Forgive me. Look, this is the mill. What the hell… Ioana? What are you doing here? Does your aunt know where you are? And you? Answer me, what are you doing here? We were taking some photos. Here? Can’t you see the roof might fall on you? Come on, get in the car, quickly. - I’ll walk. - You’re not walking anywhere. Mircea, can’t you see the storm’s coming? - I’m not coming. - What do you mean? I’m not and you can’t force me. You damned kid! Do you think I have time for you? - I forgot something! - What did you forget? - The backpack! I forgot the backpack! - Mircea! One moment, mister engineer. Mircea! Be careful! Who let this bloody thing open? You’ll break your neck… - No, mister Toader! - What? Be careful! What’s wrong? Where does it hurt? Let me see. It hurts badly, doesn't it? Damn! Come here. Careful! Mircea, what happened? I always tell you to calm down, but you don’t listen. - What happened? - Oh, he hit his leg. Could you please open the back door? - Careful! - Easy! Watch your head. - Hi, godmother. - Mircea, honey, what happened? Take him into the living room. Geo! What’s wrong, honey? Where does it hurt? Your leg? - Should I put him here? - Put him there. - What happened? - He was fooling around. Let’s see, honey. Does it hurt here? What happened? - He fell at the mill. - Where at the mill? At the old mill. I was with the engineer for approvals. It looks like a sprain, we should do an x-ray. - Can you step on it? - Let’s see, honey. It’s not a fracture; otherwise he couldn’t have stepped on it. Well, I’m off. My niece is waiting for me in the car. Thank you very much, Toader. Don’t mention it. It’s a good thing I was there. - Thanks for bringing him home. - Bye. - Cheers. All the best. - Good night. Put him on the bed. In a sitting position, on the bed. Go and get some ice and some small towels from the kitchen. - Let’s take these wet clothes off. - What are you doing? No. Leave me. - Mircea, do you want to catch a cold? - Go away. Yeah, right. Where in the kitchen? In the second drawer. They’re not here. Oh, God, what do you mean they’re not there? If it had a mouth, you’d have seen it. That’s it, take off your pants, too. Let me help you. Give me the ice. Go and take these clothes to dry. Let me do it! Mircea, I just want to help. What are you doing here? I’m drinking water. Did you hear anything at the door? No. So you can walk now? Come on, off to bed. Can you walk? Wait. Slowly. - Wait, I’ll help you. - No, I can do it on my own. Yeah, sure you can. How long do I have to stay inside? About two-three days. Don’t you want me to cook something else for you? Take some tomato. It doesn’t hurt that much anymore does it? No. Come on, you’ll be outside in two-three days. You’ll be fine before the eclipse. Did I roll it too tight? Now go to sleep. - Good night. - Good night. Hi, Mrs. Cecilia, it’s Mircea. Can I talk to Ioana, please? What, did she already leave? All right, thank you. Goodbye. No, don’t worry. Goodbye. Do you want anything to eat? No. Hello, is Alex home? Sandu’s in Bucharest. - When did he leave? - A week ago. He got here a week ago. What do you want? I’m busy. - To talk to Alex! - He’s not here, are you deaf? Alex! Alex! What the hell are you doing here? No! No! Fucking child! - What are you doing here? - Nothing. - There’s a boy over there! - What boy? There’s a boy over there, Alex, he’s buried! Do your mum and dad know you’re here, boy? He’s buried over there! Don’t let me catch you around here again, or I’ll break your legs. Hear that? Scram! Mircea? Yes. What hour is this for coming home? You’re lucky your mother is on duty. - Go and eat something. - I’m not hungry. - Mister Ilie? - Yes, Mircică. - I want to ask you something. - Go ahead. Do you remember Alex, that friend of mine from Bucharest? The long-haired one. What about him? - Have you seen him around here? - No, I haven’t. - Maybe on the bus to Bucharest? - No. Why? Just asking. Are you afraid he left without telling you? People from Bucharest are like this. You saw how he was talking to that driver. Too… cheeky. And long-haired. Don’t be upset. Gică! Who the fuck are you waving at like that? - Have you seen Alex? Yes or no. - Alex who? Alex, my friend from Bucharest. Are you yelling at me? Has anyone seen Alex? Yes or no. Yes or no. No. Answer me, tough guy, yes or no? No, to hell with your fucking friend! Happy birthday! Mircea, come here. Mircea, look at how big Alina is. - Happy birthday! - Hi! Happy birthday, Mirciulică! Hi! Hi! How are you? What are you doing, Mircea, didn’t you open the present? Later. Look at what we’ve bought you. I hope you like it. Come on, I want to see if it fits you. My, it’s so pretty! But you shouldn’t have. Oh, stop it. Why not? It’s his birthday. - Did you choose it? - With mum. Mum know what to choose. It suits his eyes. - I think it’s a bit large. I’m sorry. - It doesn’t matter. He’ll grow into it. He looks so cute. - Enjoy it. - Thank you. - Do you like it? - Yes. He’s a bit nervous. Let’s drink something. Come and dance. Come on, have some fun. You don’t have to pout. There’s no reason for it. Here you are. - Come, we want to cut the cake. - I’ll be right there. Oh, honey, what’s wrong? - Nothing. - What do you mean nothing? Your friend from Bucharest. What was his name? - Alex. - That’s right, Alex. Didn’t you invite him to the party? Why not? Did you have a fight? Mircea. Honey, you can tell me anything. Tell me. Let’s cut the cake. Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday! Come on, be happier. Happy birthday, dear. Come on, open it. How cool! So you don’t have to borrow Alex’s anymore. Do you like it? Let’s cut the cake. To the kitchen! That’s so cool! Come get some cake! Children! Get your cake. - Has your mother left? - Half an hour ago. Turn that TV down. My head's bursting. Mircea, come here for a second. Come over here. How many times have I told you to close the fridge door? But you told me to turn down the TV. So? Can’t you do two things at once? Close the fridge door and turn down the TV? Answer me. Otherwise you’re very good at sulking to draw attention. Answer me. Look at me. Why are you crying? Mircea, why are you crying? Clean this up right now and stop crying. Can’t you hear me? Stop crying. Please explain to me why you’re crying. Why? - I did something bad. - What? - I did something bad. - What? What did you do? Mircea, I’m talking to you. I buried Alex in the mill. Who? Alex. I buried him in the mill and they poured ballast on him and I can’t find him and it’s all my fault. When was this? When I twisted my ankle. What were you doing in the mill? - Just taking some pictures. - What pictures? For a contest. What do you mean you buried him? Toader closed the trap door. Toader? What was Toader doing there? He was with someone. And where were you? In the basement. What the hell were you doing there? Couldn’t he have gotten out by himself? No. He couldn’t have. Who is this boy? How did you make friends with him? He’s a boy from Bucharest. You’ll tell your mother everything tonight. And we’ll see. Clean up and eat something. I’ll wash these when I come back. What are you doing today? Are you going by Cecilia’s place to get the glasses and then off to the square to watch the eclipse? Right. The glasses. What, you forgot about them? You got so hyped that you forgot about the glasses? Aren’t you going to tell her? Tell me what? Tell me what? Mircea. Tell me what, Mircea? Where are you going? Mircea, come back! - Don’t yell at him. - Maybe somebody should start yelling. Wait and see when he tells you what he did. You’re unbelievable, I swear to God. Mircea, open the door. Did you hear me? After the eclipse, you come back straight home. And when I get back from work, we’ll talk. Did you hear me? There’s no turning back.
