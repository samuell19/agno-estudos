Mrs Littlefield's apartment. If you will hold the wire I will see if Dr Braden is here. Well, if you will please excuse me. They're calling Dr Baden from the hospital. She hasn't come as yet. Oh, John. Yes, Anna? - Are you sure Monica is coming? So she said. They're calling from the hospital. Just say Dr Braden will call back as soon as she gets here. Why do these babies attempt to struggle into the world just at cocktail time? No, really? Do they? Shall we have one? - One of what? A cocktail. - Oh, yes. Why, Mr Pettinghill. Hello. Dr Braden is expected but hasn't arrived. Just a moment, please. This call if for you, doctor. - Thank you, Betsy. Hello. Dr Braden speaking. Yes. I am on the case. Ward B. What is the matter with her? Oh, she doesn't want to spoil her perfect 32, eh? Well, her 32 is less important than that baby. I'll see you in the morning, Goodbye. You are quite right, Mr Pettinghill. But do we ever discuss anything over tea in New York? Hello, darling. - I'm sorry I'm late. It's alright. They called you from the hospital. I hope you don't have to go back. - No. I think I am free for the night. Come and meet a little capsule of dullness named Pettinghill. Oodles of money. I've been selling him your idea for the lying-in homes. I'm seeing that precious husband of mine for the first time in two days. I feel if he entered your operating room you'd stop work to honeymoon with him. Lucky, aren't I? Well, hurry and get it over. - Alright. Hello, dear. - Hello, darling. Mrs Hazlitt, this is my wife. Mrs Hazlitt is the critic on the Chicago Globe. How do you do. - I wanted to meet you, doctor. How nice of you. Hello, dear. - Hello, Monica. Sit here. - Thank you. I just read your article advocating district lying-in homes. Of course the Visiting Nurses Association have done a lot of good. But your idea is a splendid one and so ably written. Oh, it should be. John wrote it. But they were Monica's thoughts. I scarcely knew what I was writing about. I suggest you get acquainted with some of your wife's ideas. They're very big. Mrs Hazlitt has just been tearing into my last book. Nothing of the kind. I was quite nice to it. Here, dear. - Perfect. We're collecting a crowd to go downtown for a good old-fashioned red-ink dinner. Can you all come? - A red ink dinner? I shall feel like flapper at Porto again. Shall we, dear? Sorry. I'm dining in with Mansfield. I am selling him a serial. Will you come, Mary? No. I can't either. I shan't see you for hours then, John. That's the life. There's only one way for you two lovebirds to really get together. That is for either Monica to give up delivering babies or John his writing. I am willing, but how should we decide which? Discover which is the greater nuisance to society. Well, I leave Monica to your tender witticisms. Goodbye, John. See you soon. - Goodbye. Goodbye, Mrs Hazlitt. - Goodbye. Goodbye, Mary. - Goodbye. I'll go to the door with you. - Right. But you'll come back, won't you, doctor? Of course I will. Just a moment. Hold that light for me will you. Certainly. Thanks. Have you any profession, Miss .. Hathaway. Yet almost everyone here seems to have. No. I don't hang around. I like to listen. Oh, I see. I wish you didn't have that old engagement. It's fallen on my only free night at the hospital this week. We'll be on a boat for Europe in a few days won't we? But I did so hope to have an evening together. We can. I'll be home early. Goodbye, my dear. - Goodbye. John, wait a moment. Where's your scarf? Darling, it's spring. It looks funny. I don't care if it does look funny. With your throat. I just found out how you got it too. Coming out of the shower soaking feet and never even changing your shoes. Yes, mother. I should be your mother. You are such a little boy. So long. - So long. I suppose flying is a wonderful sport if you have the nerve. I am very proud of myself. I've had my pilot's license for two weeks. You'll be wanting to cross the ocean I suppose? No. Not me. I'll never try anything like that. I am too fond of living. Studying Anna's plans? Architects plans have always been an unexplained riddle to me. I hope I didn't ruffle your husband. I may have been a little too motherly. I am getting that way. I was telling him he ought to see more of the world. It always enrages a young author to be told that but he really should travel. His books show it. - I feel the same way about him. Well, I finally managed it. He goes to Europe next week. I hope you go with him, because you are the observing one. He thinks I am but .. Mary, did you hear? John is going abroad. Alone? - Six months anyway. I haven't told him yet but I can't leave my work for that long. Hardly. Besides, you know I haven't been able to have a baby. While he's away I'll go into hospital and see what can be done about it. How splendid. I think I'm entitled to one, don't you? After all the babies I've slapped the breath into for other people. I am so interested in the work you're doing, doctor. Don't get me started. I'll never stop. I get to excited. - Well it's a blessing you do. Because you're the one who has the brains and energy to stir things up. You are too nice. Monica. Mr Pettinghill - Dr Braden. - How do you do. Mary. We've been appointed to ask you to play. Yes, yes. - No, I can't. Really. I really must go. - Come now. Be a sport. I've told everybody and they're waiting for you. Come along, Mary. Get me some water, will you please. There darling. You will be alright in just a moment. Here, Monica. - Thanks, dear. Here you are. You have never done that before. Sorry. It must have been the heat. You sure it wasn't stage fright? She'd better lie down in the bedroom. - I'll take care of her. Come on, sweet. Turn the bed down for me, will you. Thank you so much. Lie down. Let me have a look at you. Don't make me feel any sillier than I am. You been feeling low today? - Hmm. Just the suffocating room. A little rest will fix you up. You're wanted on the phone, Dr Braden. - Thank you. You can stay here, darling. I'll be back in just a moment. Why didn't you get Dr James? I see. If she's that bad I'd better come over. Excuse me, can you get my bag. Hold the wire. Mary, what are you doing? - I have to go. But Mary .. - Don't be absurd. I'm alright. I'll be there shortly. I go to the hospital. I'll drop you off. I'm going the other way. - What? I have an engagement. Mary darling, don't you realize that you aren't fit to gad about like this. Let me alone, can't you. I can take care of myself. Oh Monica, I am sorry. I've got the jitters today. Forgive me, won't you. Of course, darling. Thank you. Goodbye, dear. Tell Anna goodbye for me. - I will. Oh. Ain't you dining out, Miss Hathaway? No, I didn't after all. Well Mr Braden he called twice. He seemed like he expected to meet you somewhere. Yes. I missed him. Well, he said if you should come in, to wait. He is coming right over. Sarah. I have some bad news for you. I'm going back home in a few days and I am afraid you must look for a new place. I am sure sorry to hear that, Miss Hathaway. It's been mighty nice working for you and .. Pleasant too. I am sorry to let you go. I don't know when I'll be back in New York. [ Buzzer ] I guess that is him now. Must I tell him you ain't come in yet? Never mind. I'll be alright in a minute. Good evening, Mr Braden. Hello Sarah. How are you? - Just fine. Thank you. Miss Hathaway will be right out. Come right in. Thank you. Mary. - Yes? May I help myself to a drink? Make it two. What happened? I even ordered dinner. I just decided not to keep my engagement. I didn't mean to be rude. I've been cruising around in a taxi ever since I left Anna's. Why? I just heard you were going to Europe. - Oh, I am sorry. I wanted to tell you that myself. I heard Monica say you were going. I realised that was how you meant to break it off. We've always known it had to be done sometime. I am sorry you had to make the first move. I have tried to, but .. When I heard you were going away I .. I fainted like a fool in front of everybody. Oh, Mary. I don't blame you for not waiting any longer. It will be easier with the ocean between us. You are right. I want you to snap out of it my dear. I want you to forget me. John. I love you so much. That, right or wrong, nothing matters. In the beginning I think it was that way with you too. Then you found out that it was really Monica. I am glad for her sake. They are trying to make it easy for me. That is sweet of you. But it is alright. Since we are saying goodbye I am glad you don't love me anymore. Mary. When are you sailing? The day after tomorrow. Bon voyage. Look. He doesn't see us. We haven't moved. Why can't he see us? John .. John! There. There, he thinks he sees us. Anyway, he didn't look very happy. I didn't know you were such a baby about that man. I am. Awfully. Why, Mary. - Hello. What are you doing here? - Seeing a friend off. John is on the boat too. Yes. So he was. Monica is broken-hearted because he couldn't see her in the crowd. I am so sorry, Monica. Thanks. I haven't seen you since last week. All over your faint? - Oh, quite. I hope you have forgiven me for acting up so much. You certainly had something like the jitters. Who did you see off, Mary? No-one you know. Did he sail? Of course he did. She's crying. Poor Mary. We are both in mourning. Well at least I hope your man looked at you and waved. Come along. I'm staying with Anna while John is gone. Let's go up and weep on each other's shoulders. No. I'd better not. Oh get in. You both need a drink and so do I. 70 East 55. Can I make you another one? - Heavens, no. I will never finish this. It goes to the architect's for exhibition tomorrow. It is one of those lying-in homes Monica is always talking about. Yes. It's a standard model for all of them. If Monica's big idea goes through I may have a hand in it. Wouldn't that be wonderful. Well. Do you mind if I have another drink? Not at all. - I think I will. Let's see now. What is Palmer's number? Oh yes, I know. My word, Monica. What are you consulting with Palmer about? I am consulting him about myself. Oh. You really going through with that? It's the only reason I'm not on my way to Europe. I've never heard of such nonsense. Hello? Dr Palmer there? Dr Monica Braden speaking. Oh. No, I hadn't heard. No, it is a personal matter. Thank you. Goodbye. Now honestly, he's away on a month's vacation. Now I'll have to wait until he gets back. Keep your mind on your work. You may give up the crazy idea entirely. Think so? I can't see what a woman in your position .. With your great responsibilities wants with a baby anyhow. It will make John happier. Rats. I know him so well. Having a child will give him a deeper sense of responsibility. Maybe he'll write better too. - Ah, so that's it. What you are really trying to be is more of a mother to John. But if you must satisfy your craze for motherhood, why don't you adopt a baby? There's plenty of orphans in the world. Poor Anna. She has never been in love. - So what? Can you manage that? - I can't even feel it. Are you insulting my Scotch? Come on, darling. Tell Monica what's on your mind. - It must be the man on the ship. What a pair. - Shut up. Who is he Mary? No-one you know. He is coming back isn't he? Oh. Oh, I am sorry. But darling, you are young. You will get over it. I have got to. - No, no. That isn't the way. It's all very well for you to talk. The only man you ever cared about you got. Yes. And see what it does to her. Well, you don't need to trouble about me anymore. I'm going away tomorrow. What's that? I'm going back home. What? To that little dinky western town of yours? Why, you are crazy. I suppose you'll sit there and mope the entire time. You'll do nothing of the sort. You'll stay right here in New York and have a good time. Get the whole thing out of your system. Maybe you are right. I want to meet people. Lots of 'em. I am going to the Chandows over the weekend. You can come along with me. That's a great idea, Mary. They have a landing field. You can fly Monica up in your new plane. You are bound to meet lots of attractive men there. Oh, darling. Darling, Monica will see you through it. I won't be a nuisance. No, dear. Just another victim of her fury for motherhood. Will you shut up? Now come on, darling. You are going to snap out of this. I can't. Just follow the river on the route Miss Hathaway. Then you shouldn't have any trouble finding the flying field. I'll have no trouble. Sure. You can go anywhere now. Thanks, Bob. We're all here except Monica and Miss Hathaway. White. Tell them we are waiting. Those same two held us up yesterday morning. Mary probably has another hand the way she was tossing them down last night. She's given you a rather hectic weekend. - I hope she won't miss her ride again. Well, give me a girl that makes me personality conscious. Hello Monica. Where is Mary? She's out of sorts again this morning. - Oh, what a pity. She says she is going to ride anyway. Hello everybody. I am sorry I am late. How do you feel? I am afraid I will live. Here you are, Mary. - Thanks. You think you should ride this morning? Of course. Spitfire is the only horse that can keep up with yours, isn't she? That's right. - How do you feel, Mary? Forget it. - Come on. Up. There you go. How about that flask, Bunny? - Another? Hey, a pick-up is a pick-up. I'm just beginning to feel human. Then you might just as well finish it and get it off your mind. You know, you look lovely lately in spite of the life. Well, that's that. Well, I can't see that you are going to be much use to me this afternoon. Don't lose hope. Let's tear into it. - Righto. Spitfire is a jumper, isn't she? - Five feet. Hey. Where are you going? Mary, can't you hold her? What is the girl trying to do? She's going to take the fence. - Can she jump? Of course not. She must be crazy. Mary, stop it! Mary. Are you hurt? Not a bit. Are you sure you are alright? - I'm fine. Well, what made you do it? - I couldn't help it. I .. I couldn't hold the beast. - I can't understand it. It is a miracle you weren't killed. Bert, you ride ahead and send the car. - Of course. No, no. I want to ride Spitfire back. I hate to give in. You are going back in the car. Oh no. I feel so silly. Stay right here until that car comes. Hello dear. How do you feel? - It's absurd putting me to bed. That is your punishment. I believe you people think I took that jump deliberately. No we don't. Bunny's flask had a lot to do with it. You're not used to that sort of thing. - I had to do something. I felt so rotten this morning. You felt rotten yesterday morning too. How long has the "feeling rotten" business been going on? Oh, about a week. I hope I'm not coming down with flu or something. You're not. Fever? No. I'm not going to be sick. I've got to keep going. I've got to keep my mind occupied. That won't be hard. Tell me. Did you and this man of yours quarrel? No. What did happen? - Nothing. Did he just cool off on you? Let's not talk about it. A decent sort, isn't he? - Of course. I suppose you can get in touch with him? No. And I don't intend to. Oh, come on now. This bust up or whatever it is can't be as serious as all that. I don't want to talk about it. I'm afraid you must talk about it if I can help you. You can't help me. I think I can. It's in my line. No Monica. I'm not! Horrible. No it isn't, darling. It's lovely. What am I going to do? Tell him the truth. That's no use. Why not? He is married. Oh. Monica, you've got to help me. Don't you ever dare talk like that again. Don't you ever think that way again. What's going to become of me? Put yourself in my place. I wish I could. I would be the happiest woman in the world .. If John and I could have a baby. Oh darling, I am sorry. That was selfish of me. Monica, you will help me? Listen, darling. I will take care of you until it's all over. When it's necessary you can go to the country. There is an ex-nurse up there with a sweet little place in Hurlington. It will be wonderful. - But I .. It will be glorious, darling. How I envy you. Mrs Swiegart, you leaving? Yes, doctor. All safe and well thanks to you. I imagine you are glad it is all over. I will never go through another one. You darling, you. I wish I could hold her. - But you can, doctor. They'd laugh me out of the hospital. Goodbye. Goodbye. - Good luck. Goodbye and thank you. - Hello, Mary. How are you, dear? - Alright, I guess. You'd look perfection if you would just smile a little bit. Don't bother to take off your hat. There is nothing that needs going over today. Besides, I shan't be seeing you for a week or so. You just follow instructions and have a good time. Like yourself a little, will you. [ Buzzer ] Well? No. Dr Henderson is taking all my cases after today. I shan't be here. You're not leaving town, are you Monica? - No dear. I'd be scared stiff if you were. I'm just going to be awfully busy. That's all. Haven't I told you? John is coming back in two weeks. Oh really? First I'd heard of it. You must be excited. Of course I am. He comes back sooner than you expected, right? He writes he's tired of Europe. He missed me. It's the longest we've been separated, you know. Two whole months. Monica. Couldn't I go now to that place you mentioned? What's the matter? Nothing. Only I hate to face my friends. I feel they are staring at me. I would be much happier there. I like it in the country. Well, I suppose I'll he to humour you. Alright. I'll arrange for you to go at the end of next week. Couldn't I go before? I don't see how. I'm going to the hospital tonight. As a patient. You are? Oh. What is it? I know it is beastly selfish of me, but what if anything should happen to you? Don't be silly. It's the simplest thing in the world. Things do happen. Not with a man like Palmer. He is going to make me the happiest woman on earth. Oh, it is too good to be true. Hello? Yes, Dr Palmer. Well. Thank you for all your trouble. Goodbye. What is wrong, Monica? He said there is no use in my going to the hospital. Ever. Oh, darling. I am so sorry. There you are, my dear. Monica, it's lovely. John, is it possible you love me so much? What difference does it make? You get the results. I know you couldn't afford it. But you've made me insanely happy by doing it. You've had it coming to you for a long time. Ah, there speaks a man with an active conscience. You are not going? You two must finish trimming the tree. As John is plying you with diamond wristwatches I'm obviously in the way. Have a drink before you go. - I wouldn't dare. I must go home and work. - Oh, John. I forgot to tell you. Anna won the contest. Really? Yes. When Monica's hospital scheme goes through I am to be the architect. Oh. I am so glad. Congratulations. - Goodbye, John. I probably shan't see you before. So merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas to you, Anna. Call me tomorrow, will you dear. - Yes, I will. John, you don't know how happy you have made me. I am glad. I so wanted to. You know. You've always been a bit vague about why you cut your trip short. It used to trouble me a bit at first. But now I know. It was so you could afford this. I felt lost over there. That's why I came home. Did you miss me? I'm sure of it now. Penny for your thoughts. I'm trying to make it clear to myself why I bought you such an expensive gift. You know, I started out by selecting one at half the cost. John, what happened? I walked out of the store with it. And I stood outside under the awning. You know how we take things for granted. Well, I suddenly realized how much you really meant to me. What a lost hopeless wretch I'd be if we didn't mean so much to each other. Well, I felt so thrilled at my discovery that I went in and .. Well, I bought myself a present for you. So, merry Christmas, darling. It is the doctor herself. Now, you've nothing to worry about. Ask her to come right up, won't you. - Of course. Here we are. How do you do, doctor. Hello there. - Good evening. How's Miss Hathaway? I'm so glad you are here, doctor. She is half crazy with fear. I was afraid of that. Mrs Monahan, this is Miss Littlefield. How do you do? - I've told her all the circumstances. I thought it might comfort Mary to know she was here. Take off your things while I tell her. Make her a cup of tea while she's waiting. Come right in to the parlor. Dr Braden seems to anticipate a difficult time. Monica. - Hello, darling. How are you? I am so glad you are here. I am afraid. - There's no need to be. I feel so alone. - You are not, my sweet. I am here and I am going to stay here until it is all over. Besides, I brought someone along with me. A friend of yours. - Who? - Anna. You shouldn't have. I didn't want anyone to know. But your secret is perfectly safe with her. I didn't know I would be such a coward about facing death. Mary. If only he knew. If I thought it meant something to him, I would .. I wouldn't feel so desperately lonely. You could still telephone him if you like. No. Ah, there. You mustn't. Shush. There. You'd better move this over there, will you. I have sterilized the instruments. Mrs Littlefield is bringing them up. Alright. Put this instrument table behind the screen. Get me New York City. Wichitan 2-9000. Who's she talking to? I don't know. Mrs Littlefield is downstairs. May I speak to Mr Braden please. I've got to speak to him. You've got to tell me where I can get in touch with him. He's got to be here. John! What is the matter? Monica. The man is John. Why, the little .. Doctor .. it's time I move her in. Yes. Move her in. - Wait a moment. Get another doctor. Fitzgerald. I'll attend to that. Monica! Go upstairs to her. You must call someone else. - She is your patient. Right now, her life and reputation are in your hands. Do you think I'd touch her? - You are going upstairs. I'd kill her. I have the right. You lie. That woman upstairs is nothing to you but a patient. You're her doctor under oath to deliver her child. Go upstairs, Monica. Thanks. [ Baby crying ] Take the patient back to her room. Monica, you must look. I shan't be needed any further tonight. - But Monica .. I'll telephone in the morning. Goodnight, Anna. Monica. There, there, dear. Try to go to sleep. [ Telephone ] [ Telephone ] Hello? Monica, what have you done? You've not said anything to John, I hope. Oh, I am so glad. I've been so worried all night. And you are not going to, are you? I am too dazed to know what I'm going to do. I'm afraid to think. I don't even dare trust myself to talk. How is the patient? Gains strength every minute. She's been asking for you. Doesn't realize anything is amiss. Monica, she won't see the baby. Don't ever mention that baby to me again. And when I come to see the patient please keep it out of sight. Who was it? Just Anna. Read that review? No. The telephone interrupted me. Hello, dear. Monica is coming. Anna, what is wrong with Monica? - I hadn't noticed anything. She's been different since the baby was born. The last 2 or 3 days it's been terribly apparent. Maybe she's disappointed in you because you won't see it. She must realize why. Well, if I were you, dear. I'd make it very clear to her. Good morning, doctor. - How is everything? You should take a look at the baby. It has got me more than worried. Worse? - Yes. If I know anything the mother has got to feed it. I'll have a look. Let me see the chart. Look, doctor. See how she has lost her strength. Just try it yourself. You are quite right. What this child needs is her mother. I'll speak to her. Hello, Anna. - Hello, Monica. How is the patient? Monica, why don't you ever kiss me? I am a doctor now. A machine. But you were so sweet to me before. Is it because I won't see my child? Why won't you love that child? - I do love it. A strange way you have of showing it. Can't you understand why? I am afraid not. I want to forget him. Monica! Please don't go. I want my baby. Please bring her to me. Hello Anna. Been here long? No. They said you were coming down from delivery so I waited. Thank you, Miss Gelsey, I'm alright now. - You will take a good rest, doctor? I promise. - Alright. Goodbye and have a nice vacation. - Goodbye. What's happened? The woman upstairs and her stubborn baby put me out of commission for a moment. That's all. So, now you have taken to failure? How long do think you can keep up this strain? I'm going away tomorrow with John. - Really? Oh, I am so glad. A sort-of second honeymoon. - Oh, that's a perfect solution. You keep your husband. And don't let him have an inkling that you know anything ever happened. No. That's not what I meant. I'm giving myself two weeks with him. Two weeks of illusion and forgetfulness. Then he has to know. But Monica, that is so stupid. - They love each other. And it is their child. But you don't know whether John loves her. Don't let's argue any more, Anna. We've gone all through it. No. I'm going to have my two weeks alone with him. We are going to a little place that John took me to when we were first married. We were so happy there. I've always dreamed of going back. Well. Those two weeks of happiness. May be all I'll have for the rest of my life. Your favorite spot, isn't it. I love to watch the sun go down through those trees. The last one we'll see. I really hate to go back so much. I'll remember this trip as long as I live. I'll remember it as I remember our honeymoon. You know, we ought to do this often. It's great for both of us. I've got a whole new book in my head since we came. And you have been so sweet. I am terribly grateful. That is a funny expression: grateful. But I am. You make me lose track of time and everything. Then suppose we stick it out another week? I'll forage for a typewriter and do some work. I can't, John. Not possible, eh? Kiss me. You know. We haven't been a bit like a sedate old married couple. You've made this a week of romance. Have I? Why .. what are you crying about? I suppose because it can't last forever. Look. It's a beautiful ending, isn't it. The best part is, knowing when we want it again, it'll still be working for us. The same old stand. We mustn't be caught out on this lake after dark. Bad for our reputations? Let's have a cigarette before we go back. In my bag. A telegram? Oh yes. I got it this morning. Read it. What's all this? I'm thinking of going to Vienna. Vienna? - Yes. That plan for the lying-in home seems to be going through. Well, if it does. I'd be the head of it. I'd need at least a year to work in Vienna to be equal to it. Why don't you give a fellow some warning? I suppose you want me to go, don't you? Do you want to? I'll be on the book for another six weeks. How long will it be? Let's not talk about it now. Let's watch our sunset. It is late. Oh John. Remember the night you gave me my watch? You made me feel that you loved me terribly, that night. I did. I wanted to make you feel that night that nothing could ever take your place. Did you really mean it then, John? Then and now. Where do you want these? They can go in this trunk. Elizabeth. You see all those evening slippers on the closet floor? Yes. - You may have them. All of them? Why not? I shan't need them. No night-life for me in Vienna. I am a working girl. You hear that, John? She'll not spend her nights studying when I come over. If you were smart you'd sail with her and finish your book over there. Six weeks isn't long. It will just give her time to miss me as I missed her .. When I went over alone. Am I right? You are right. I think she wants to cry. You might get out and give her a chance to do it. Make yourself useful and phone the Express Company. The trunks go today. When do you want them to go, Monica? - About five. Elizabeth, I could do wonders with a cup of tea. Certainly. And you, doctor? No, thanks. Anna, would your rather have a Highball? - No. Tea, Elizabeth. Since when have you taken up tea? I haven't. It will take Elizabeth longer to make it. Now see here. The suspicion has been growing on me all afternoon. Are you leaving John for good? Yes. It's quite a long way to go. I suppose you'll write him the cheerful news from Vienna? The letter is already written. Well, you are thorough I must say. I'll mail it as soon as I get there. Such a noble gesture of surrender should be preserved in writing. It is the only way I can tell him. I can't stand much more. You might stand hearing what he has to say himself. What difference could that make? Let's not talk about him anymore. It's amazing the amount of junk one collects. In fairness to John, you should come out into the open and talk it over with him. What is to be gained by torturing ourselves? I won't have our last few days like that. No. But you will pay for it in years of misery. Talking to John isn't going to prevent that. The facts are there and must be faced. Or sensibly ignored. And that is up to you. That's where you are wrong, Anna. The existence of that child can't be ignored. What nonsense. Suppose you hadn't found out about it? It just so happened that I did. - Now see here. You and John love each other. He and Mary don't. You're only making the mess worse. I know it's a mess but I can't help it. Well, why don't you let Mary face her own problems? Anna, will you please shut up. I tell you I am doing the best that I can. Elizabeth. When I finish making this call will you call me a taxi. Certainly. Will you have your tea in here? No. Take it back and bring me a man-sized drink. Yes, ma'am. Hello? Hello, Mrs Monahan? Is Miss Hathaway there? Ask her to stay in. I am coming out immediately. Yes. Thank you. Hello, Mary. - Hello, Anna. I'm so glad to see you. Sit down. How is your charming daughter today? Isn't she adorable. Hello, darling. She is growing prettier every day. At least I would think that. How is Monica? She was busy packing when I left her. - She'll be very excited about her trip. I am afraid not. But her work? It's just her way of trying to forget. I don't understand. I know you don't, dear. But you have got to now. Monica is leaving John. John doesn't know a thing about it as yet. Monica intends writing to him from Vienna. She cannot bear to tell him. You see, she loves him very dearly. Then why is she doing it? Because of your baby. Yours and John's. I didn't think she knew. I didn't want her to know. I hoped John would never find it out. - He hasn't. Monica has never told him. She found out that night. She heard you try to telephone to him. And yet she went through with it. Mary. They love each other very much. We must to do something to stop them smashing up. Of course. Monica feels that John's place is with you. But John doesn't love me. It is the baby that Monica is thinking of. I see. Mary. If you could just talk to her and make her understand. What a splendid thing for her to have done. Giving me my baby knowing it was .. I have simply got to do something. She is leaving tomorrow, isn't she? Yes. She sails at midnight. - Anna, I have an idea. I haven't had many in my life. Good ones. Leave it to me will you. Everything will turn out alright for Monica. The taxi is waiting. Thanks. I am writing this note to Monica about the baby's feeding. Of course you can tell her all that but .. Well, I want to thank her for all the trouble she has taken. She will be tickled to death to have the little one with her. I bet if you stayed away for more than a week she wouldn't let you have her back. I know she'll be in the best of hands. Give her to me. There dear. It isn't as if it were for a long separation. I know. Where is that home of yours? It is in Ohio. I made it once in five hours. Have you notified the airport? Yes, dear. They'll have the plane ready and waiting. Will you get my gloves, please. Of course. From the bureau? - Yes. Goodbye, darling. Miss Hathaway, I can't find your glove anywhere. It's alright. I found them. I am going now. Goodbye. The Flying Field. Quickly. It's a long time since you had her up, Miss Hathaway. Sure. I have got to get my hand in. I'd be a little careful. The weather is blowing up. Where you heading for? - Paris. You will find it kinda hard on a 2-hour gas supply. She left it about half an hour before you came in. I asked the woman if it wasn't meant to go to the hospital. She said no. She seemed to think you would understand what it was all about. Here is the note that she left. "Forgive me, Monica. I'll never bother you again." "The baby is yours and John's. Can't you forgive me and be happy." Have I made a mistake? Shouldn't I have let her leave it? No, Elizabeth. You did quite right. She has been left here by a friend in my care. Isn't it awkward. You are sailing tonight. Hello, darling. Sorry to be so late. Swiegart is the hardest man to get away from. He wanted to talk about a new contract. I said you were sailing tonight and I was in a hurry to get back to you. Even that wouldn't stop him. I'm only back from the hospital myself a short time. The trunks and everything have gone, I suppose? Uhuh. This is going to be a gloomy old joint in a few hours. Perhaps it won't be. Well, I will be mighty glad when it is time to join you. John. There is something I want to tell you. I don't know quite how you'll take it. - What's up? [ Telephone ] Hello? Monica, a dreadful thing has happened. Mary has flown a plane over the ocean. And they have no trace of it. They are afraid she is lost. Isn't she coming to see you off? I told her to call me later. Now, what was it you had to tell me? Come in here, John. I will show you. I have adopted her, John. Monica. Do you mind? - Mind? I think it will be the most wonderful thing in the world. We have always wanted one. Where did you get it? Whose is it? I thought it better we didn't know who the parents were. Then we can think of it more as ours. The mother died. From your hospital? No. But I know it came from splendid people. Monica, this is great. You will be so happy. Will you? Your happiness is mine, old girl. 0urs. Well, I'll be darned. Let's see you pick it up. I swear I've never seen you look so lovely. What about the sailing? Postponed, of course. When it is old enough, we will all go together. And will we be proud. What is it, a girl? Alright with you? - That's all I ever wanted. Hold her, John. She is yours. -(-R-oS-)-
