(horns honking) REPORTER (over TV): ...minister has accused the U.S. of an attack on a civilian building in Murmansk which resulted in multiple casualties. The White House denies any connection. In response, the U.S. has accused Russia of trying to shift blame for the downed commercial flight over the Barents Sea. Each country has yet to prove its claims, but the fact remains relations between the two nations haven’t been this strained since the Cold War. There are also concerns about how an escalation in tensions could affect the economy. A U.S. trade representative has stated that... JOHN: Mr. Secretary. John. (door closes) Greer told me you were dead. I’m sorry to sneak up on you like this, but I had to go ghost. It was the only way I could get you that information. Wh-What information? About the mission. We weren’t supposed to make it out of there alive. Sir, this was a CIA op. They ran it out of D.C. the entire time. They’re trying to heat up tension with Russia. You’re not suggesting Dillard?
