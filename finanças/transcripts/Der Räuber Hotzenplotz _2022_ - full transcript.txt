Well, what do we have here? A coffee grinder. Give me that thing. -Pardon? -The grinder. -Give it here! -I beg your pardon. How dare you shout at me like that? Who are you anyway? The robber Hotzenplotz. That's the one. Now give me the coffee grinder. And please, no shenanigans. I don't like that. Please, Mr. Hotzenplotz, you can't take the grinder away from me. When you turn it, it plays my favorite song. That's why. I want a grinder like that too. You really think it'll fly to the Moon? Of course, and maybe much further. But someone has to steer it. Someone brave. And smart. Me? -Do you reckon I can do it? -Of course. There. You can do it. -Give it to me! -No! -Yes! -No! -Yes! -No! Yes. There you go. That's more like it. Now count to 999. And when you've counted to 999, you can call for help. But not a moment sooner. Got it? And have a nice day. What do I do now? Oh yes, he said to count. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten... 326, 329... 523, 524... 633, 712, 905, 906, 910, 920... Must be the fuel. 994, 998, 999. Help! Help! Grandmother! Jump in! Hurry! Come on, you can do it! THE ROBBER HOTZENPLOTZ BUTCHER MOOSBACHER FRESH MEAT TODAY This is for dear Wasti. We haven't seen him in such a long time. Goodbye, Mrs. Schlotterbeck. Sorry, Mrs. Blotterschleck, uh, I mean, Schlotterbeck! But it's an emergency! WANTED Sorry! -Uh, boss... -What? Boss! Woah! Sauerbier, what are you doing? Hold the ladder! Boss? Just you wait. I'm going to give you a talking-to. -Finish this up, Sauerbier. -Yes, boss. Oh no, oh no. Is it serious? I think she's just passed out. We'd better bring her inside. What on Earth has gotten into you two? Dear me. What happened? Is it serious? No, Mr. Mimpfeldoser, uh, Dimpfelmoser, she just passed out. Thank goodness. -And what's that? -Medicinal spirits. Ah, respect. Just imagine what happened. I was robbed. By whom? By the robber Hotzenplotz. Wait, I have to make a record of this. He stole my coffee grinder. The one we made you for your birthday? Wait, one thing at a time. And please, stick to the facts. And you two, stay as quiet as mice until we're done with the report, okay? -Will I get my grinder back? -But of course. How long will it take? It's hard to say. The fellow's very cunning. We've searched the forest for his hideout for two and a half years. And now, once more, very slowly. So I can take notes. This is how he appeared. I'm sitting here on the bench. Right? That's when he comes towards me. Right? And he waves a gun in my face, like this. Right? And at that moment... Think Dimpfelmoser will nab Hotzenplotz? If he could, he'd have done it already. Hotzenplotz is much too smart. He's not easy to catch. I've got it! -What? -A plan. Come on! Wait! -My goodness. Awful. -Yes, quite awful. Yes. Just you wait, you're in for it now. Zwickelzwackel, let's begin, tubers don't need any skin. Zwickelzwackel, snip and snap, the peel should finally come off! Peas and carrots, toad eggs and cholera! You have got to be kidding me. What is it? Hello there, Zwackelmann. Open up. -What do you want? -I have something for you. Come in. Now I'm curious about what you have for me. Sit down. -A pinch? -Don't mind if I do. Go for it. Darn, that's what I call snuff. -Where can I get some? -It's homemade. Nose Balm's the brand. Go on, have another. How superb. Perhaps we could make a deal. -A deal? -This here... For two, no, three sacks of Nose Balm. What is it? A coffee grinder. -Coffee grinder. -A coffee grinder. Yes. But this one... plays music. Listen. Honestly, Hotzenplotz, don't you have anything that I need? I don't know. What do you need? -A servant, for example. -A servant? Yes, but one who can peel potatoes, because I love potatoes! But he needs to be dumb. Dumb as a post. Dumb as a post? This castle holds many secrets, and I can't have anyone sticking their nose into everything. So, do you have one? I don't think so. Too bad. -Done. -Now you've lost me. Well, then pay attention. Hotzenplotz carries the crate away and we follow the trail of sand to find out where he's hiding. But why would he haul the crate to his hideout? That's why. "Caution, gold!" Gold? He'll never believe it. That we have that much gold, I mean. He's not an idiot. Wait. "Caution... no... gold!" -What if it goes wrong? -What could go wrong? -It's an epic plan. -If you forget to pull out the match? I'll tie a knot in my handkerchief. Then I won't forget. See? Where am I supposed to get a servant? If this keeps up, I'll have to find a new line of work. Would you look at that. Kasperl. Then that must be Seppel. What's written on the crate? "Caution... gold!" "Caution, no gold!" Well, which is it? And what if he doesn't find us? Maybe he's taking a break from robbing today. He'll find us. Wait and see. Hands up and no shenanigans. I don't like that. -What's in there? -Nothing at all. But it says, "Caution, no gold!" Yes, exactly. No gold. Definitely no gold. You're pulling my leg. Please, Mr. Hotzenplotz. You have the coffee grinder. Why do you need a crate full of gold too? Let me worry about that. Now get lost. And quickly! -What's he doing? What's he doing? -He's looking at the crate. Nailed shut. And heavy. Very heavy, in fact. And now? What's he doing now? He's taking the crate. We'll wait a little and then follow the trail. Oh no. What now? Crate down. Look, Papa. Papa? A whole crate full of gold. WANTED What is this? What's going on here? Sand. Darn, shoot, and drat! What were you thinking? Just you wait, you snotty brats. You want to pull my leg. But you won't mess with me. Not with me! What was that? Probably some animal. Come on. Whatever you're up to, I've been doing a long time. -I feel sorry for him. -Who? -Well, Hotzenplotz. -What? How come? He's surely excited about the gold, and when he opens it to find just sand, he'll surely be very sad. He can be as sad as he wants for all I care. Have you already forgotten he stole Grandmother's coffee grinder? -What's that? -What? Huh? Can robbers go in two directions at once? I don't think so. Maybe he got lost or walked in a circle. We'll have to split up. -You go right, I'll go left. -Seriously? -Got a better idea? -He might recognize us if he catches us. -He'll smell a rat. -We'll disguise ourselves. Where will we get a disguise so fast? If I lend you my cap and you give me your hat, he won't recognize us, as he'll think you're me and I'm you. -Oh, okay. -So, give me your hat. -So, how does it feel? -Kind of weird. I feel like... you. Very good, then Lotzenhotz, I mean Protzenrotz, no, Motzen... oh you know who, certainly won't recognize us. Let's go. You go right, I'll go left. -Kasperl? -Yes? If I'm you and you're me, I'd actually have to go left and you'd go right, right? Agreed. -Kasperl? -What? Take care. You too, Seppel. -Huh? -Who do we have here? -The robber Hotzenplotz? -That's the one. A shot from the pepper gun never hurt anyone. Yes, my dear Kasperl. That's what you get when you stick your nose in things that don't concern you. But I'm not Kasperl, I'm Seppel! And I'm Constable Dimpfelmoser. That was a good joke. Do you hear that? Do you know what that means? It means we have a visitor. Hello? Hello? Seppel? Would you look at that. Seppel. Why are you calling out for yourself? Ow! -Kasperl? -Seppel? Are you daft? Pointed cap, Kasperl. Seppel hat, Seppel. -Got it? -Of course, Mr. Potzenlotz. What? What did you call me? Hotzenplotz is my name. -Of course, Mr. Lotzenpotz. -My goodness! Can't you remember any names? Sure I can, Mr. Potzen... You're trying to insult me. Absolutely not, Mr. Schlotzenrotz. You really are incredibly stupid. Did you know that? As dumb as a post. Dumb as a post. Dumb as a post. Dumb as a post. All because I don't have a servant. Petrosilius, are you going to stab me? -What do you want this time? -Does your offer still stand? A servant in exchange for snuff? -Open it up already. -Take it easy, old boy. And is he as dumb as he looks? So dumb that he can't even remember the simplest of names. That's good, that's very good. I once had someone who was anything but dumb. She just pretended to be. What's your name, my dear? Kas... uh, Seppel. Seppel. And can you peel potatoes too, Seppel? -Can't he talk, or what? -Answer Mr. Zwackelmann! Can you peel potatoes? Yes or no? Of course I can, Mr. Schnackelmann. What? Zwackelmann is my name, and to you it's the Great Sorcerer, Petrosilius Zwackelmann. -Very well, Great Sorcerer... -I'm listening. Zeprodilius Wackelzahn? You're making fun of me. Just you wait. Zwickelzwackel, dunky and funky, in the sack, a monkey. Where did he go? Seppel? That's what happens when you have no respect. But Petrosilius. Old friend, he doesn't do the thing with the names on purpose. He only does it because he's so dumb. -Dumb? -Dumb as a post. Ouch! For heaven's sake. Kasperl? Seppel? Mr. Dimpfelmoser, something terrible has happened. What? Now? Kasperl and Seppel, they've disappeared. What gives you that idea? A handkerchief? -With a knot? -It's Kasperl's. In the middle of the forest, and very close by... This! WANTED ROBBER HOTZENPLOTZ I love potatoes. Boiled potatoes, fried potatoes, potato dumplings, baked potatoes, mashed potatoes, boiled potatoes in their skin, potatoes... Stop that! I don't like that at all. -What's taking so long? -Here they come. -More, a lot more. -Yes, Mr. Wackelzahn. May I ask you something? If you must. You're a great sorcerer, are you not? Yes. -Do you doubt it? -Absolutely not. But I'm wondering why you need a servant. -Oh? -You could just make the peel vanish. Then I wouldn't have to toil away peeling them. Yes. Of course, I could do that. But... Why should I? Why should I? I wonder how Seppel is doing. Hopefully, better than I am. This stuff is superb! Bless you. What? Uh, bless you. Do you want some too? The herb curls you toenails. No, thanks. What's the matter? Are you crying? I don't like it at all when someone cries. Hold on. I'm going to cheer you up a bit. Funny, isn't it? Right? You can sleep here. -On this empty bedframe? -Patience. I'm going to bed. And no mischief. I have my eyes everywhere. Good night. Good night. No need to be sad. Who still wears a red pointy cap nowadays? Shall I steal you a new one? I can steal you a new one, if you want. -I don't know. -Now... Now don't get so down. This is unbearable. Sorry. -What's the matter? -I'm tired. -Then sleep. -I can't. -Why not? -Because I'm cold. Cold? I see. Then say something. Better? Hello? Don't look down. Just don't look down. Huh? What on... This can't be happening. What do I see and hear? Seppel wants to run away? Who could be so dumb? There's no way out of my castle for you. Mrs. Schlotterbeck? Yes? I need your help, urgently. It's an emergency. EGGNOG He was a good man. Yes, he was. And so fond of animals. Wasti. We have a visitor. -He's been so restless lately. -Oh. It's already been half a day and a whole night since the children disappeared. Isn't there anything you can do? You do have those... skills. Sorry, but I don't do that anymore. You have no idea what can go wrong. Wasti, please. What's the matter with him, your Wasti? -What? -What's wrong with him? He's somewhat unwell at the moment. More biscuits? Mrs. Grandmother, Constable Dimpfelmoser is an expert. He knows what he's doing and is doing what he can. Sand? In the middle of the forest? Very suspicious. It's hot. Three double knots should be enough. Hup! Would you look at that. Dimpfelmoser. Where are my clothes? And where's my bicycle? Those poor children. I hope they're all right. What smells so good? Hello? Is anyone there? It's me. Dimpfelmoser. Oh, Mr. Dimpfelmoser. Do come in. You must have news about Kasperl and Seppel? News? Not as far as I know. -Yes, but... -May I? Bratwurst with sauerkraut. Respect. But there must be clues. They can't have just disappeared. -Right, Mr. Dimpfelmoser? -What? No, of course not. That Hotzenplotz is a nasty man, truly repulsive. Well, I wouldn't label him a nasty man. Oh yes, he's a proper monster. What else has to happen for someone to put a stop to that creep? Does he have to kidnap me first, or what? Not a bad idea. Mrs. Grandmother, I must request that you accompany me. -Where to? -The station. -Right now? -It's about an important buildup. About an important what? An important... a backup, a lineup. With a suspect. A very, very suspicious suspect. Ah ha. Of course. I'll just get another layer. I'm ready to go. You maintain a swift driving style, Mr. Dimpfelmoser. Yes, yes, very swift. But perhaps you could ride somewhat slower? Sorry, but time is of the essence here. Uh huh. Say... Could it be that we're lost? Absolutely not. Utterly impossible. I say! Mr. Dimpfelmoser! Sorry. You're not Dimpfelmoser. Well spotted, Mrs. Grandmother. -Stop, at once. -Sadly, I can't grant you that request. After all, I'm a nasty man. Forgotten? -Then I'll have to jump off. -I'd advise you not to. Unless you want to break all your bones? Well, then I am obliged to whack you on the head with the bike pump. Carry on whacking, Mrs. Grandmother. A police helmet can withstand a lot. -Well... -What on... Was that a bush? POLICE STATION Look. -Sauerbier! -Boss? Get undressed. -But Mr. Dimpfelmoser... -Do it already! Yes, sir. All right, Here's some company for you. -Grandmother! -Seppel! Oh, thank goodness. -You're alive. -Now she's starting with that. That's not Seppel, that's Kasperl. -I sold Seppel. -Sold him? -You can't just sell a child. -You bet I can. Foot up. Foot up. Foot up. To whom did you sell him? Well, wouldn't you like to know. ATTENSHUN, ATTENSHUN When we look at all the facts and evidence again, what stands out to us? What stands out is that all the evidence is linked to one question, namely: Where is Hotzenplotz hiding? WANTED ROBBER HOTZENPLOTZ -Boss. -What is it? -A letter. -Well, read it out. Yes, sir. "Attenshun, attenshun! To Cheaf Constuble Dimpfelmohser! I wood like to inform you: Grandmudda and Kasperl are in my fourest." -Sauerbier, can't you read? -I can, but it's... Give it here. "And if you wont to see dem again... 5,555 doller in gold, but quack... But quackly! And no shinanigones! I don't lick that. Hotzenplotz." If you ask me, you'd better nab Hotzenplotz quickly. Yes, but how, wise guy? After all, I'm not psychic. Psychic. So... But... Boss? Seppel? Yes? I'm traveling today. To a colleague in Buxtehude. We have important things to discuss. Until my return, I'd like you to do the following: First, peel and dice six buckets of potatoes. Second, saw three fathoms of wood. Third, scrub the floors. Fourth, dig out the empty patches in the garden. Repeat that. I'm to first saw six buckets of potatoes, second, scrub three fathoms of wood, third, peel the floors in the kitchen, and... Stop! You're mixing it all up. You can't remember the easiest of tasks. Would you like to send me away? You'd like that. You being a bonehead is really very annoying, but it undeniably has its advantages. Fine, it's enough if you peel and dice six buckets of potatoes. Because after my return, I wish to eat fried potatoes with bacon. Good, now I have to go. See you soon, Seppel. Huh? Amazing, isn't it? Zwickelzwackel, this is a lark, magic coat, go as fast a shark. Get me out of this hood, fly directly to Buxtehude. Kasperl! Hello? Kasperl! Oh, we're out of firewood. I think I should get some more, urgently. "Entry strictly forbidden!" "Entry most strictly forbidden!" It gets more and more forbidden. "Entry utmost strictly forbidden!" Maybe I'd better come back tomorrow. Kasperl! ENTRY MOST STRICTLY FORBIDDEN!!! Stop, freeze. Not one step further. -Hello? -Here I am. Over here. Here! -What are you? -A toad. -A toad? -A kind of frog. -And what are you doing down here? -Waiting... to be released. You should know I'm not a toad at all, but rather, a fairy. A fairy? Zwackelmann cast a spell on me and locked me up here. -But why? -Because he's evil. He can't stand fairies because we only do good. What's more, I sometimes cast a bit of a spell on him too. Now I've been sitting in this hole for seven years. And if you don't help me, I'll have to stay here forever. I'd love to, but I don't know how. You have to get us a particular herb, the fairy herb. If you touch me with it, I'll be free. But how am I to do it without Seppel? Those eyes are everywhere. I can't get out of the castle either. Yes, you can. You just have to leave one piece of clothing in the castle. -And the spell is broken. -Really? -It's best you set off right away. -I don't know where to find this herb. I'll give you directions. Be brave, Kasperl. You can do it. -And now? -Your hat. Take off your hat. Uh... I'm sorry, Seppel. Now run, as fast as you can. Trust me. Shall I really get that odd herb now? Maybe I'll go to Dimpfelmoser first, so he can free Seppel. And... Kasperl! We have a deal. -Forgotten already? -No, no. -I'm going already. -That's good. Easy for her to say. It'd all be a lot easier with Seppel. -That's disgusting. -What did you say? How can you behave like that? Constantly burping and farting. And robbing and kidnapping other people. Have you never considered getting a real job? A real job? Robbery is a real job. Hard work, in fact. I can only laugh at that. Have a little more respect, you. Do you never brush your teeth? Don't ever think that robbery is easy. People think you have it easy. Just look fierce, knives in your belt. It doesn't work that way. Robbery is a tough business. Didn't you ever want to do something else? I used to have other plans. An inn in the forest for example, or... A prospector in America. -But, well... -What "well"? He wouldn't have allowed it. -Was your father a robber too? -And what a robber he was. He must have been strict. Oh yes, that he was. Oh, you poor thing, now you'd have us believe your father's to blame for you becoming such a bad person? But... I'm not a bad person. -I'm a robber. -Oh, and that excuses everything? I don't have to listen to such prattle anymore. I really don't. I'd rather go to work. I think he's mad now. Oh, but it's true. What's this? Mushrooms? My dear Mrs. Schlotterbeck. I desperately need to find Hotzenplotz's hideout. As fast as possible. And what made you think of me? Thanks. Well, you do have those skills. -Skills? -Well... Those skills. You know. That... I'm sorry, I don't do that anymore. Bad things can happen. But Mrs. Schlotterbeck, two children have been kidnapped. Grandmother too. What? Grandmother too? It's a disaster. All right then. I need an item of their clothing. Yes, wait. Yes. If you will. -Respect. Exactly what we need. -Quiet now. I have to concentrate. It has been such a long time. Yes. Orb, orb, orb... round. No, no, uh... Again. Cold glass, a view clear and quick, look for Kasperl, do the trick. -That's Kasperl! Kasperl! -Careful. With the slightest tremor it can be days before I can use the orb again. Sorry. Well, if you ask me, Kasperl doesn't look very kidnapped. Observe. Always observe first. No loot. Nothing at all. If this keeps up, I'll really have to find a new line of work. This can't be happening. I'm back. What's going on here? We thought you'd surely be hungry after such an exhausting day of robbing. -What's that? -Mushroom soup. With bacon and lots of garlic. Does it taste good? It's the best soup I've eaten in my life. -Right, Kasperl? -Mhm. Oh God, Seppel, I mean Kasperl! What's wrong? Tummy ache! I think it's tearing me from the inside! -Exploding mushrooms. -What? There must've been exploding ones under the boletes. They're poisonous. They'll tear him apart from the inside. Can't anything be done? We have to tie him tight so he doesn't burst. But I'd need a rope for that! A rope! A rope! -My God! -Rope! Thanks. Very kind. -And? -I think it's better. Very good. Then it'll be over in a minute. Don't tell me it's starting with you too? It started exactly like that for me too. -And now? -Well. Are you saying you're going to let me burst? That would probably be best. Don't you think, Seppel, uh, Kasperl? I don't know. Maybe we should cut him a break. Yes, exactly, Kasperl. Cut me a break. Very well. Wow, you performed really well. Performed? What do you mean "performed"? For a second, I thought you really had poisoned yourself. Did the two of you play me? And? Do you have it? If you please, where have you hidden the keys for the shackles? The keys? The keys, I have them here in my pocket. A true robber always carries important keys on their person. So. Now untie me. And quickly! This must be it. Now I just have to wait until the Moon rises. I urgently need fried potatoes. Seppel? Seppel? Seppel? Where are you? Ow! Darn! What is that? His hat. Just you wait, you rascal. You don't get away from me that easy. Carry on! The floor has to twinkle. Carry on! Yes, Mr. Hotzenplotz. If you can con others, you can toil too. My hat. Who on Earth are you? Me? Seppel. No. No way. Seppel looks different. I know that because he's my servant. And that hat there, it's his. -But I really am Seppel. -Nonsense! Just like Hotzenplotz. He always got us mixed up too. -What? How? -Because we swapped. Our hats I mean, so no one would recognize us. So... If I'm to believe that you're Seppel, then prove it. -How? -By giving me Kasperl's cap. -I can't. -What? Why not? Hotzenplotz burned it. He threw it into the fire. -What? Why? -I don't know. I think he was trying to be nice. That Hotzenplotz! That darn goofball! -That boot, is it his? -Yes, yes. Give it here! Move! Zwickelzwackel, wherever he may be, this boot's owner, he'll fly to me. Zwackelmann. Wow, that's what I call a sorcerer. Ah, and Kasperl is here too. That's not Kasperl, it's Seppel. What nonsense. Tell him you're Kasperl. -What's that supposed to mean? -I'll tell you. The lad you sold me has run away. And he wasn't that dumb. He just pretended to be. Is it my fault that you let him go? Why don't you magic him back? You're the "great sorcerer." Because it's not possible! -And why not? -Because you burned his cap. Yes, that was funny. Right, Kasperl? That's not... That's Seppel. I can't summon Kasperl here now because of you. You... You... You bull! Bull? That's going too far. Take it back. No, you're an idiotic bumpkin. Zwickelzwackel, don't move an inch, from the robber, we'll make a bullfinch. You idiot, now you have plenty of time to reflect on whether it really was such a good idea to burn Kasperl's cap. Now to you. Can you peel potatoes? Then off to the kitchen with you. Take the bullfinch with you. Shut your beak, Hotzenplotz. Seppel? Seppel? I'm going to nab Kasperl. And when I get back, I want to eat fried potatoes. -Understood? -Yes, Mr. Dackelzahn. -Uh, Mr... -Yes, yes, it's all right. Get to work. Wow, Kasperl, be careful. Kasperl. Kasperl, look, the Moon. There! There it is! The fairy herb. Mr. Dimpfelmoser? -Mr. Dimpfelmoser? -At your command. Take a look at Kasperl. What's that in his hand? Fairy herb. -Fairy herb? Is it dangerous? -Powerful. -Very powerful. -Respect. Where on Earth could he be? He can't have gotten that far. Well, what's that? What does he have in his hand? Is that... Just you wait! -Thunder and lightning, where'd he go? -Careful! Hello? Is anyone there? Hello? Kasperl! Kasperl! I know you're here. I might not be able to see you, but... I can smell you. I can smell you. I'm here, you spud! I'll get you. I'm here, behind you! This is a stupid game. You dung toad! You're the dung toad! Zwickelzwackel, this is a lark, magic coat, go as fast a shark. I'm your new boss now, fly back quickly, to the castle somehow! Wait! Come back! Come back! Thunder, lightning, and sulfur vapor! This can't be happening. This orb is precious. Now it could be days before I can use it again. How are we supposed to find Hotzenplotz's hideout now? Quiet! What about Wasti? Surely, he's a good sniffer dog. -Absolutely not. -But it's an emergency. Still. I'm sorry, but... I hereby oblige him to a special police assignment. Namely, as a sniffer dog. Come, Wasti. There... Th... Th... There's... There's a... a... A crocodile, I know. And it's all my fault because I made a mistake practicing my spells. And now it's out. Seppel? Seppel, what are you doing here? Kasperl? Where are you? Out here. -I can't see you. -Wait. -Incredible! How can that be? -I'll tell you later. Pull me up first. Quick. I don't know how to land this thing. -Boy, am I happy to see you. -You too. -We have to get to the cellar. -But... Come on, we have to hurry. Come on! Kasperl! -Where are we going? -To free the fairy. -The fairy? -I'll tell you everything later. Zwackelmann. Together, we can do this. Let's go! Kasperl! Hello, fairy? I have the fairy herb. Tell me what to do! Give me your hand and pull me over. Quick. Kasperl! Well, you're in for it now! Very well, that won't do you any good either. I can smell you. Zwackelmann, you potato nose. Are you out of your mind? To hell with you! Kasperl. -You have to jump. -I can't. You have to try. -The toad. -Quick, touch me with the fairy herb. Thunder, lightning, and sulfur vapor! Amazed, are you? Now your reign will soon be over. You lying, wicked fairy. I'll transform you into a much uglier toad on the spot. Zwickelzwackel... one, two, thr... You... -No. -Oops. He's gone. Forever. That was a pretty good throw. Who are you? I'm the fairy Amaryllis. And you're Seppel. How do you know that? -Oh no, oh no. -Quick. Come. We have to get out of here. -Where are you going? -Go ahead. I'll be right behind. Come on, come on, come on! -Where is he? -Here he comes. -Here I am. -What have you got there? A very special bullfinch. -I don't understand. -I'll explain later. All right, you two. I'm going home to the fairy kingdom. This ring is for you. It gives you three wishes. Say them aloud, turn the ring, and they'll be fulfilled. But consider your wishes carefully. Farewell, you two. And thank you so much. Three wishes. Terrific. I desperately need a new pointed cap. But then one wish would be used up. So? We'd still have two left. True. I wish for a new pointed hat, just like the old one. Brilliant! Grandmother will be amazed. Grandmother! Slowly, slowly! Leave him. I think he's picked up a scent. -Pardon me. -Sorry. Seems to be a dead-end. Wasti! Wasti! -What is that? -That's Wasti. -Wasti? -Wasti. Wasti. Hotzenplotz, the jig is up. Any resistance is futile. Come out with your hands up. -Where is he then? -No idea. What's more important is where Seppel and Kasperl are. Here we are! And we brought Hotzenplotz with us too. That's supposed to be the robber Hotzenplotz? What do you take me for? No, it's because of the fairy Amaryllis, who was turned into a toad by sorcerer Petrosilius. Into a toad? -A kind of frog. -And I'm supposed to believe you? I'll tell you what I think. You're just eager for the reward. I think your allegation is out of line. Please don't intervene in investigations. The children only did what anyone would. Mr. Dimpfelmoser is an officer. He knows what he's doing. What do we do now? They don't believe us. We could turn the ring again. But then we'd only have the one wish left. That's enough, isn't it? -You think so? -Mhm. All right. I wish that the bullfinch would become the robber Hotzenplotz again. What's going on now? Zwackelmann? Is this another one of your dumb jokes? Hey, you. Get down from my desk. Who are you anyway? But Constable, that's the robber Hotzenplotz. Nonsense. -Robbers in socks? -It is. I recognize him. You must arrest him. Out of my way! You're under arrest. Fine by me. But can someone take this thing off my head? Absolutely not. The cage stays on. I'm so happy to have it back. -Doesn't it sound beautiful? -Marvelous. Quite marvelous, Mrs. Grandmother. What will happen to Hotzenplotz now? I think he'll be put on trial. Very good. That awful man belongs behind bars. The two of you will receive a reward. Just like sniffer dog Wasti, hm? I've decided to no longer hide Wasti from the world. It's not his fault that I messed up practicing my spells. Mrs. Schlotterbeck, don't worry. Here, take another slice of plum cake with cream. What I wouldn't give for Wasti to be a normal dachshund again. The poor, poor animal. It's no life for such a dog. We have everything. We don't need any wishes. We're doing well. You're right. You do it. Me? I wish Wasti would go back to the way he used to be. Wasti! My Wasti. Wasti, Wasti, Wasti! Have I missed anything? No, Constable. Come and join us. Would you like some plum cake with cream? Respect. For me? Thank you, Constable. Wasti. -He's a guard dog. -Well. Snuff from Zwackelmann. And it's supposed to fly with that? You did say the fuel was the problem. That's Dimpfelmoser's uniform. THE END And no shenanigans. I don't like that. So, let's get out of here. This way. Hoppity hop. Quick. I'd better go left. Yes. Dudeldudeldumm. Dudeldumm? What does "dudeldumm" even mean? I think I'll become a composer. I'll write a song.
