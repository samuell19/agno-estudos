Hello - I’m Mohan Rao speaking Which Mohan Rao? - You came to office in the morning and spoke, right? Yes, say - I called to share one thing with you I’ve got 25 years of bonding with this company. I took care of Srinivas like my own son And when heard he committed suicide, I somehow couldn’t believe I doubted something for sure has happened Thus I went few times to complaint at the Police station. But there, they said case is already closed and why do I care None cared and I couldn’t just stay still watching so And thus I sent message to Police Commissioner, media, Judge and district Collector I don’t know how far would the information I give help you, but recently I saw our guy with a girl many times With the closeness I had, I asked him one day Our revenue is very good in this quarter. Even that Japan contract is like coming to us. I’m sure about it - Nice Thank you Son, one small thing... You won’t mistake me, right? - Yes I saw you recently with a girl many times. Any good news? You’re elders in age You know your limits well, I don’t think should say you I felt his behavior somehow strange Thus I’m saying it with you Where did you see that girl? Thank you Hey... Hey... Your body looks great to see. This sets correctly for massage Will the hair come? Go man Oh no, our ACP... Sir, what are you doing here? I saw that girl - Girl... Which girl Sir? - That girl I saw in the flat What, you saw our ghost? Where Sir? Hey come to a side, what in the traffic? You’ve seen right? This is the deed by a suspended Police Officer He made a mess saying to have seen ghost in the auto Common public is questioning how when Police to safeguard peace and safety does so? Let’s wait and see how our Police department responds on this I really saw that girl Sir, she’s escaping and moving around And Sir, Srinivas’s isn’t a suicide - Satya, I’ve already warned you That case is closed. You are making an issue unnecessarily Now TV people repeatedly plays that clip and say Police are a waste Sir, there’s CCTV footage to show Srinivas was with that girl in party that day And if you give permission, I will - Stop it Satya This is my last and final warning. If this topic comes before me once again, I‘ll take serious action on you You may leave now Yes - Are you srinivas’s wife? - Yes Where did you write, on this mirror? I asked her yesterday when she came as to why she isn’t coming regularly. She said health isn’t fine When I heard he committed suicide, I somehow couldn’t believe It’s a suicide Satya and the case is closed Let anyone believe me or not, I’ll somehow solve this mystery Who do you want Sir? Yesterday at about 11, a girl with a black scarf got into an auto, who is she? She used to live in the penthouse and left vacating this morning Did she vacate? - Yes Sir You know where is she now? - How will we know, Sir? Can I see the flat? - Not possible Sir It’ll be a problem if our people see, not possible Sir. No sir... What’s this dude? - I said, right Ravi? Still, none of you are believing What’s there in this? There’s Romeo, Juliet. I don’t understand anything Ravi, she’s trying to communicate something. She says me as Romeo and she’s Juliet Damn! Isn’t it any Laila Majnu? Did you call me so urgently to say this? Sandhya is waiting at home and I need to take her out Boss Satya... It’s you I’ll prove you. One second Ravi, see this. This is my 7th class photograph She’s Paddu and we both are from the same class Listen Ravi, now it gets interesting. Look at her Only this girl used to call me Romeo. She’s Juliet, Ravi I just remembered. That annual day we played Romeo Juliet. I was Romeo and she was Juliet And exactly that same day night, she went missing. None knows where she went, Ravi Ravi, the girl I’m searching for and this girl are the same Stop it, just stop it Ravi - What 7th class, what is Romeo Juliet play and what’s that girl? What’s her relation to this case? Won’t you leave this case? Damn! Satya, I know. You can’t forget Paddu so easily. It’ll take time You’d been to Goa for forty days right? Go elsewhere in the same way. Try to forget her I know it’s tough, please. Be peaceful and let me be peaceful Yeah, starting. Bye dude, bye I’m coming Only this girl used to call me Romeo - Romeo Excuse me madam - Yes Please say - Did you identify madam? Satya Which Satya? Satya Dev, studied here till 10th. I didn’t have interest in Mathematics and you made me take up that subject. Yes, Satya come. Sit down, be seated Thank you madam So, how are you Satya? - I’m good What are you doing now? - ACP Oh, Police? Good So, would you like to have anything? Coffee, Tea... No, I’m fine. Thank you - Ok Your batch often come and visits. You haven’t attended any Alumni meetings. Did you identify this girl madam? 15 years back, she had to play Juliet in Romeo-Juliet play. But, in the last minute she was replaced with Paddu She was never again seen in the school and said she ran away What exactly happened to her? Do you have any clue? Students, topic being given to your class this time for annual day is Shakespeare So, let’s do the Romeo-Juliet play. Who’ll be the Romeo? Satya, you play the Romeo role - Ok madam And, who is the Juliet - Ma’am Paddu, not you. Let’s give a chance to... That girl... You do the Juliet Look into that line carefully, next is you - Ok Madam - Yes You got a call - Is it? - Yes - Ok Thinking school reputation gets damaged if that matter is out, we managed at the Police In my entire career, that’s the only bad experience I had Thank you madam Who’s that girl? Who’s she? She comes across As a mystery Who’s that? The girl shaking Is she the remembrance of past or answer of future? Curtains raised and seen Like a lightening, where did she vanish? Heart beat fast and confusion on, time is gone It’s hard enough Heart beat fast and life shivered, didn't identify Heart is swinging Satya, I’ve been trying from two days and no response. Where did you go? You went searching for that Juliet, right? Satya, you are going mad You are unnecessarily trying to connect two random dots I don’t know what’s the link in between Srinivas’s murder and Juliet And to Paddu’s death, there is no relation at all It’s just an incident. May have fallen slipping by leg, right? I think, you are trying to prove something by connecting these two It just doesn’t work that way, trust me Satya, when our loved ones die before our eyes... I think I can understand that pain It’s time you move on, you have a bright future What did you say Ravi? You can understand my pain? When the girl I loved more than my life died in front of my eyes... How that pain is... I’m sure you can’t understand, Ravi I don’t know about my bright future I promised her, Ravi To safeguard her very carefully I gave a word I’m a loser now What did you just say, Ravi? It is just an accident? Maybe even I’d thought the same if I hadn’t touched Srinivas’s case Either you support as a friend or leave it But never, ever call that an accidental death Please... Never... What are you thinking to do now? See this So, are you meeting Juliet tomorrow at the mosque? Paddu She spoke to you at March 22nd party. Do you remember? She was on very high that day in party. She asked rest room directions When a person arrived, she left with him What? Do you remember who it was? I don’t exactly remember. But, I can recognize seeing him Why, what happened? What exactly is your name? You say Juliet and move in the burkha (Black dress) And when went to school, wardens said you ran away Who exactly are you? I’ll say Satya, I’ll say everything I was most happy that day than all After getting ready, while I was coming from hostel... Why are you so beautiful today, dear? Sir, what’s it Sir? No... I did to save myself but not wantedly None cared though I was saying When said to call the Police, I got frightened and ran away When you ran away why did you return back again? You were in Srinivas’s flat that day. What exactly is the relation between you and Srinivas? It isn’t in anyone’s hands about when and where would the life lead Similarly I too entered unexpectedly into Srinivas’s life Excuse me - Yes Are you Christina? Huh! So, why are you messaging me? I saw your interview recently in Times of India. I liked it very much Innovations you are doing in Pharma industry are just amazing So, I fixed to do a job just in your company I’m texting to know if there are any job openings What, you texted me for job? - Yeah If there are any openings, we mention on our website If your qualifications match us, you get a call from HR team I found Can you keep up? It’s ok Yeah Baby, I always wish to be like this Shall we get married? - Marriage? - Yes Why so fast? I have some professional goals I should take business to a range. I should see my name in the top businessmen list of India It’ll take some time. It may take at least 4 to 5 years Why so much anger? - I said right, I want to be just with you Not like that, if I say marriage now, my uncles will think I’ve no interest on business and lost focus They’ll try to take my position and I don’t like that But... I have an idea What? Like that I said Christina and joined in Zumba We started a secret relationship without anyone from the flats knowing that We both were very happy He even planned dinner on March 22nd night. I too thought to give him a surprise But that day... I came to know what he really was Srinivas along with a few big shots, basing on his Pharmaceutical Company in city is manufacturing Mandrax pills They’re exporting to foreign countries. Crores of business is running I asked the same matter that day after the party Come out What happened to you, why are you like that? See baby, ask me right away if there is anything to be asked But don’t be serious like this - You know what, it’s my mistake Continuing my feeling from childhood, I came till here searching for you, I was a fool I thought you were a good guy. But I just came to know that you’re running a dark empire in mask I wished to give you a surprise - What is that? My name isn’t Christina - What? Do you remember? Romeo-Juliet play in childhood in 7th class, you were Romeo and I was Juliet What Romeo and what Juliet? What are you talking? Didn’t you still remember? St. Anns School, when all were teasing me as I came newly, you blocked them all Hold on, wait a minute! Let me think. My name is Srinivas, Satya Srinivas Kakrla What? - I don’t understand at all about what you’re talking Ok! Wait, wait a minute. There was a guy named Satya in school and was very active in cultural activities A girl ran away those days from school, was that you? Satya Dev! You came to me, mistaking for him This is classic, man. I mean, this is crazy. Oh poor girl! Listen to me darling, let me make one thing clear to you My name is Srinivas and I’m definitely not your Romeo. Understood? What? You got close to Srinivas mistaking for me? He took you so casual. Then what was the need for Srinivas to commit suicide that day?

I spoke with that Doctor and changed the postmortem report. I created it as suicide. But there isn’t any link to me and that Srinivas’s business as you think I did all this for my son. They kidnapped him and threatened to kill if I don’t close the case as suicide But, I’m not sold out as you think Satya... Satya... Satya... Hey Police, are you surprised thinking that the girl vanished in front of your eyes? - Satya No time, just one hour If the bullet from the girl’s shoulder isn’t taken out, girl is dead - Satya Give back the slip which this girl gave you Hey, that isn’t with me.

It burnt the same even for me No way out Satya Sir, I’m sorry. There was no way out There are three letters in your name, ACP... Assistant Commissioner of Police You get respect automatically. I too have the same three letters, ASI... Assistant Sub-Inspector of Police That means a person like dog in the department. Don’t you understand? I’ve been in the same position from 15 years. I wished to do some miracles in the department I worked hard like a dog. I couldn’t close any case properly at least for once. Why, why? I caught the criminal, wrote case, arrested and filed report. But, with pressure from higher official or politician or with some pressure, I let him go Srinivas idiot, that drug dealer... What happened in his matter? The same I wrote case, filed FIR and when I thought to arrest, you know what did that Commissioner of Police said? Is it you, who asked for appointment? Yes Sir, I’ve been trying from one month Sir. - Come on sit - Thank you Sir What is the matter? Manufacturing Mandrax pills in unexpected quantity in our city and are not just supplying in local but are exporting them Sir This is about 1500 to 2000 Crores business yearly Sir It’s influence is very high on our city youth, Sir It is easily available from high school students to the PG students, Sir. Poor kids Sir And thus, I personally investigated Sir Sir, his name is Srinivas Kakarla. This is the main person behind the business Sir If you give permission, I’ll directly raid and get him caught red handed Sir What name did you say? - Srinivas Kakarla, Sir Your name - Rajaram Sir How long are you in the department from? - I’m there from 15 years Sir If you’re so exactly, you’ll be the same even for the next 10 years Who is your CI? - Sir, Ravi Sir Call him Hello - Sir, I’m Rajaram Ok, say - Sir, it seems Commissioner Sir will talk Your ASI has come to talk regarding a case - That fellow is a joker Sir He brings in something in emotion and when we go and look into, there’d be nothing in it I’ll take care Sir, you leave that - Ok Joker! Every human needs another extra thing along with the basic necessities, what is that? Self-respect... Self-respect Every day when I stood before the mirror, I used to feel ashamed of myself I used to feel what the hell this life is Almost I gave up Hello - Rajaram, sincere guy never has a value in this world You made a report against me. But I don’t have any anger on you So, I’ll come straight to the point. We worked so long without any links with department But now, if a guy joins hands with us from the same department, we’ll rule the market We’ll give you an identity which you don’t have there, along with the money Are you ready to work with us? - I got another chance in life again I joined with Srinivas I didn’t have in the department, but here I have an identity for myself How many containers? 20 containers? Ready Whenever you want, I will... Shipment immediately... What money man... Money... You give it later. No problem... Done Did you inform Srinivas? - Who is Srinivas, man? My foot Srinivas! Does that idiot know business? Business grew after I came, right? Just follow me and that’s enough But in that day’s party, I set deal with Harry idiot. I said to give him that shipment number Srinivas asked you for 200 Crores - Yes Give me 50, I’ll give you the shipment number - Ok man Deal - Deal Your consignment is ready, my friend. Whenever you transfer me the money, I’ll give you the shipment number I’ll wire you the money in two days Ok then, I too will give you this number after two days What’re you seeing so? You too need it? I’m observing you from so long What, are you doing a setting with Harry? Ok, it seems you are saying to our boys that Srinivas is now a waste and you are doing the whole show? Srinivas, you are drunk and we shall talk tomorrow in the morning Hey, what Srinivas? Call me with respect Mr. Srinivas Still, it isn’t your mistake, idiot. I brought a street dog. I forgot that dog does have a tail which always is curved I never expected that Dog one day would try to loot away my position Does he say Dog? Then I decided to somehow finish that Srinivas idiot I saw Srinivas and his girlfriend talking there Suddenly, his girlfriend hit with bottle on his head and ran away I went to him I threatened Ravi, kidnapped his son I threatened him and closed it as suicide case I thought how to give up this bloody job. It then struck to me I asked Shafi in that day’s operation to shoot me Shoot me... You returned from Goa at that same time You started the investigation. You said the good news to have seen Srinivas’s girlfriend Not knowing the container number, that same bloody ship is waiting in Nigeria port from a month That Harry is been waiting for that. Shafi is been following you You said, the girl missed out at the signal. You remember? That night, Shafi had to close her and brought that till here Hey, tell that shipment number idiot Help Satya... Satya... It was this fellow who took Paddu that day at the party What are you saying? Are you sure? I saw with my eyes and this was that fellow What did you do to my Paddu? Nice party - Yeah... Hey man, I need an Indian girl tonight Yeah? - Yeah Say, whom do you want? Which girl? - Girl in cream dress Paddu, let’s dance - No, no you go and I’ll stay back Done You go, I’ll come - Ok, you stay. I’ll go He got the answer needed in 47 days. But there are still many more questions. But he wishes to keep all those questions aside... and want to live with his daughter along with Paddu's memories. Say Ravi - What dude, didn’t inform to be going? Isn’t the anger on me still gone down? - Nothing Ravi This place and this house are reminding me of Paddu I couldn’t bear... And thus I, baby are leaving to Mumbai Ok dude, be careful. I’m happy that you’re moving on. Take care Baby, pack your stuff Satya, I wish you’d read this letter sometime. I don’t understand the incident from yesterday night at party Maybe you’d understand if I say. But I don’t feel would be happy lifelong by sharing that with you Take care of Swecha, love you Daddy Yeah Love you
