Narrator: Confined within the walls of a South African jail the young lawyer from India found no reason to complain Some say that jail is a palace others look upon it as a beautiful garden Some others hold that through the jail gates we shall pass from our present bondage to freedom The year was 1907 the young lawyer from India was Mohandas Gandhi Gandhi led his fellow Indians in a nonviolent struggle against racial oppression for eight years they marched into forbidden territory they burned their registration papers they expected to be arrested and they were not disappointed Gandhi said nonviolent refusal to cooperate with injustice is the way to defeat it he gave his nonviolent weapon a name Satyagraha, holding to truth. in every decade and on every continent underdogs have taken up Gandhi's strategies to fight for their rights and freedom nonviolence means fighting back but you're fighting back with other weapons the power that Gandhi discovered changed the 20th century Spring weather comes early in 1940 adding to the illusion the tranquil Denmark can remain untouched by the war that is spreading across Europe Danish government has proclaimed neutrality and reduced its Armed Forces by half Denmark intends to remain at peace On the morning of April 9th everything changes Attacking by air land and sea, the German war machine meets token opposition in the south but then Denmark orders its troops to lay down their arms Bruun: we could not imagine that it had anything to do with the war or occupation or anything like that we flew out of our beds and looked out of the window. They were very close. Those Germans they were always so noisy Suddenly, we realized that this was something very terrible the invaders capture the headquarters of the Danish army general staff without firing a shot disbelieving Danes wander the streets watching helplessly German leaflets and posters say we come not as enemies but as friends and promise that Denmark will remain under Danish law and government it's hard to believe Hitler has occupied an entire country in under six hours Late that afternoon, Danish Prime Minister Thorvald Stauning asks the Danish Parliament to officially accept the terms of the German occupation Stauning: My father felt that his policy was the least harmful for the people if we had used the military on April 9. They would've bombed Copenhagen without a doubt thousands of people would have lost their lives Narrator: Rather than suffer certain defeat, Danish political leaders choose not to fight. Their goal is survival. They will attempt to hold the Germans to their promises to respect Danish neutrality they will negotiate the terms of occupation under protest hoping to turn the charade of friendly relations to Denmark's advantage. Bundik: The king was in place, the Parliament was legislating, the police was in charge of the law and order, the Danish courts were functioning and the Jewish community was functioning Narrator: At the start, German troops are well-mannered and respectful but their very presence is a provocation. Danes wonder now that we have capitulated, what next? They have not prepared for a German occupation. They have no Gandhi. They have no resistance organization. Almdal: In most homes the attitude was that we have to accept this and try to make it work but for goodness sake don't try to have anything to do with them don't ever speak to a German, oh dear, and be careful what you do Danish cabinet ministers adopt a policy of resistance disguised as collaboration Danes will cooperate with the Germans but only as a tactic to preserve self-rule German demands will be negotiated by diplomats, delayed by bureaucrats and quietly obstructed when possible For many Danes it's not enough Denmark was humiliated and the whole population actually, suddenly felt that they had lost something something of their thickness, something of their conscious dignity. What were you to do? What could you do in this situation? You couldn't go out fighting, the fight was not there So they gathered in the park of the city and and sing national anthems Narrator: Every week the song fests grow signaling the birth of Danish solidarity against a common enemy And Danes take new pride in their king who rides alone every morning as always Bruun: People were very proud that we had a king. It was like a way of demonstrating against the Germans and we weren't interested in any form of dictatorship Germans ignore exhibitions of national pride as long as they do not interfere with German objectives--to use Denmark's farms to feed the German army, to use Danish factories and shipyards to supply war material Relations with Germany are handled by Danish Foreign Minister Erik Scavenius, a man many believe is pro-German. Nissen: When people argued with him and said "well, in the long run we are losing our respect all over the country," he said "well, yes, that's correct. But... we might keep our respect and be dead, all of us." He said, "how many corpses do you want in order to save your honor?" Narrator: Scavenius wants the Germans to think they're getting what they want to keep pressure off Denmark In November 1941, he goes to Berlin to sign a treaty justifying the German invasion of the Soviet Union When his photograph with Hitler is published in Denmark outraged students take to the streets Narrator: after five days Danish police restore order but public support for the Scavenius policies is severely damaged underground resistance leaders condemned even tactical collaboration as treason their primary weapon is information The illegal press reaches two and a half million Denmark's entire adult population uncensored news of the war gathered from the BBC and other sources fuels Danish hopes and the illegal press also encourages active resistance of all kinds small-scale attacks, arson the stealing of weapons from German soldiers, pouring sugar into gas tanks. All the work of untrained high school students they say "if the adults won't do something we will" German authorities order local police to crack down but patriotic young Danes are determined. Ljungquist: I was very angry at the time a lot of young people were angry and we were angry that we hadn't done more, resisted more than we had. We later realized that it was a hopeless situation but that doesn't change the feeling which I still have that we protected our country so poorly. Narrator: In November, SS General Werner Best takes charge in Denmark Hitler tells him to rule with an iron hand Best pressures Eric Scavenius, the new Prime Minister but most Danes have turned against the Scavenius policies On BBC broadcast from London, a Danish political exile John Christmas Møller now speaks defiantly against the Prime Minister and calls for active resistance Møller: Understand that the merciless rule here and it's time for Denmark to take a stand you're going to join and are you willing to contribute we must ensure that we do not harm the soul of the nation Spring 1943, the German occupation is three years old A facade of cooperation continues but popular loyalty shifting to the resistance movement By day the government campaigns against sabotage By night explosions rock the factories and rail lines, cutting German supply lines at their source By summer of 1943, reports of German defeats in Russia, North Africa and southern Europe encourage the Danes to more vigorous resistance There were strikes in the provincial towns, not only strikes in the factories but whole centers, where administration, stores, everything was closed Sabotage attacks more than double in only one month But those Danes who are unable to carry out sabotage find other ways to resist even defying their own government Hoff: First of all, we work really slowly We never worked at the same speed as before the war. We received orders to build new ships but the ships were never finished the construction was sabotaged so in the end they had to drag them down to Germany to finish them. Nissen: the Danish Authority did whatever they could to stop the strikes and they found out that this was impossible, they could not, they had lost the authority ...the authority of leading these masses lay with some local, unauthorized and not elected leaders and with the illegal press Narrator: A government in name only, Danish political leaders have one last act to perform. On the morning of August 28, 1943 they receive an ultimatum from the German occupiers Strikes must be banned, curfews imposed, saboteurs executed Denmark must answer by 4:00 p.m. Parliament debates the demands for six hours Nissen: Now these were demands they could not say yes to and then they told the Germans that they could not accept this ultimatum Foreign Minister Scavenius and his cabinet resign Parliament goes home Denmark is no longer under Danish authority Direct German rule postponed for three years by the Scanvenius policy of cooperation descends on Denmark The Weimar occupies key facilities gatherings of five or more persons are banned the new rules are brutally enforced Almdal: Now we knew where we were, two opposite parties and cooperation had become impossible so we would have to go out different ways trying to make things work of course but there was no doubt now that they were the enemy and we were the occupied country Narrator: just weeks later they faced their first crisis when Adolf Hitler orders his commanders to impose Germany's racial laws in Denmark Pundik: Having survived from the outbreak of the war there was of course kind of, you know, a belief that things would be alright but the shield which had protected us against the fate of Jews in the rest of Europe the shield disappeared we were standing undefended against the Germans Narrator: The German gestapo has obtained a list of names and addresses for the seven thousand Danish Jews but plans for the roundup have been leaked, the Jews are warned Thousands of Danes stepped forward to save them Pundik: I remember the shock I got on the day I went to school and suddenly the headmaster knocks on door and called me and another Jewish boy out of the class and told us "you'd better hurry up because your parents are waiting for you you have to get out of your flat, the Germans are coming tonight" Narrator: The roundup begins on the night of October 1st but the Jews have been hidden in attics and cellars, in the churches and homes of thousands of Danes who have spontaneously taken them in Ljungquist: We were sent for example one time to to pick up some Jews who were arriving by train from Jutland. We were to help them pass as casually as possible through the German checkpoints The ferries there were closely guarded by the Germans so it was necessary for us to pretend that we had a relationship with these people Narrator: Their refuge will be Sweden only a few miles across waters patrolled by the German Navy they hide in forests and wait Herbert Pundik and his family are picked up by one of the many fishermen who risk the voyage and save all but a few hundred of Denmark's Jews Pundik: I look back towards the coast and I saw something which shall never forget in my whole life I'm not a religious person myself but still however I'm still moved when I think about it. On this sandy beach, I saw the three persons that were our savior, his wife and the wife of the fisherman kneeling on the beach with food that lifting hands towards heaven praying for our safe passage Narrator: The rescue of the Jews has united and inspired Danes just as they're coming to view the resistance movement as their de facto government the freedom council publishes a first clandestine leaflet in November 1943 The program of resistance aimed at denying Germany the benefits of occupation with explosives and equipment air-dropped by British forces the underground avoids human targets concentrating on war related industry Their first targets are Danish industries and transport that supply the German army Each success brings harsher and deadlier reprisals by the Nazis who bombed theaters clubs and Copenhagen's renowned Tivoli Gardens In a desperate move to stop the explosions, the German governor puts the population of Copenhagen under curfew in June 1944. Workers at the Burmeister and Wains shipyard retaliate with an ingenious but risky scheme We had hoped to get rid of the curfew We wanted to have our freedom we didn't want to be locked up at night At twelve noon we went to the gate and start kicking it we said we wanted to go home because we needed to water our gardens Twelve hundred shipyard workers go home early They insist it's not a strike they must tend their gardens in the afternoon because the curfew stops them from gardening in the evening The "go home early" movement spreads fast. Thousands of workers in other factories walk off their jobs but few go to their gardens Congregating in the streets they demonstrate, build bonfires, and taunt German patrols Six Danes are killed on the first day Ljungquist: There were barricades in the streets everything was set on fire in the streets All work stop no one wanted to go to work All these things created a sense in the population that the Danes now had to fight against the Germans and that was probably the most crucial effect of the general strike. Narrator: Nazi Governor Werner Best tightens the vice daily Troops are ordered to shoot at groups of five or more Then he cuts off electricity, gas and water Danes respond by cooking on fires and dipping water from a nearby lake Best tries to blockade the city to cut contact with the outside world The population follows instructions from resistance leaders until the curfew ends and shootings stop, stay on strike says the Freedom Council Hoff: I looked up to it--it was the country's lawful, the ones we listened to We'll be on strike until tomorrow at 12 o'clock it was very very clear to see the people follow that and precisely at 12 o'clock the next day everything started up again The Germans had great respect for that Narrator: Best is desperate to resume production but his military options are limited his troops have been taken out of Denmark to fight the losing war Most of all, he knows the Danish workers are worth more alive than dead On the ninth day, Best concedes. He will end the curfew and withdraw his troops if the strikers go back to work The Freedom Council issues a victory bulletin which ends the walkout It declares strikes are their most effective weapon unwittingly the Danes have adopted Gandhi's favorite tactic by simply withdrawing their obedience Recognizing the power of non-cooperation, the Council shifts its emphasis from encouraging sabotage to coordinating strikes In the next month, they call for a series of symbolic two-minute stoppages Denmark suffers through one last brutal winter with shortages in fuel, water and food. and then it was spring Almdal: As was normal in those days we gathered round the wireless to hear the message from BBC and then all of a sudden the transmission was interrupted and then came this wonderful message that the Germans had given up Narrator: A Danish historian concluded Denmark had not won the war but neither had it been defeated or destroyed Most Danes had not been brutalized by the Germans or by each other Nonviolent resistance saved the country and contributed more to the Allied victory than Danish arms ever could have Ljungquist: It was a physical feeling, a combination of euphoria and to chills, it felt so strange the tears welled up and I remember very clearly that I spontaneously said "so we survived" those were probably the first words out of my mouth, "so we survived" It was the right atmosphere for strike, Before 6 a.m. we started distributing the leaflets At any moment I could have been stopped and arrested means so obviously I was afraid Narrator: Workers at the Lenin shipyard in Gdansk are angry enough to strike Angry at recent price increases and the firing of a popular co-worker but only a few realize their strike will pit them against the full force of the Communist government in Poland. Borowczak: People started yelling open the gate we're going downtown to the regional communist party headquarters then we knew we had to start singing the national anthem that would calm people down We're not going to make the mistake of 1970 when we went into the streets and tanks rolled over us Narrator: Every worker in Poland knows the story of December 1970 Strikers left the shipyard and marched on Communist Party headquarters Six were killed and 300 injured they learned the futility of taking on armed troops in the street One of them was a 27 year old shipyard electrician named Lech Walesa He was fired for union activism in 1976 but now in 1980 he has returned to help organize the strike. Walesa: During those 10 years since 1970 when I was a leader in the same shipyard I had been thinking where mistakes have been made and if fate gave me a chance to lead again how would I do it? Narrator: This time Walesa and other strike leaders have planned carefully Walesa is known and liked by many at the shipyard He announces: "we will occupy the shipyard I'll be the last to leave" the strike will be strictly nonviolent the government will have no excuse to begin shooting The strike committee commandeers a cafeteria in Walesa's old department Their first step is to make sure news of the strike is not suppressed by the regime Alina Pienkowska a shipyard nurse telephones Jacek Kuroń at the Workers Defense Committee in Warsaw who will pass the news to Radio Free Europe and the BBC Pienkowska: Thanks to that, the world could hear about us not only the world also the families of the Gdansk shipyard workers learn that way why their husbands or Father's or sons didn't come home at the regular time and this phone call caused people to get organized in the city of Gdansk Narrator: On Friday morning, the strike has widened, public transportation has stopped, the port is closed and 22 factories are on strike 50,000 workers in all Government has cut phone lines to the rest of Poland for fear the strikes will spread but it's too late All over Poland, people know about the Gdansk strike In the cafeteria, the strike committee hammers out a list of demands They prepare leaflets for the striking workers at the top of the list is the rights to free and independent unions and the rights to strike unprecedented rights that Poland's communist regime will surely resist On Saturday, the shipyard director has received orders from his Communist Party superiors and is ready to begin negotiating The shipyard offers generous wage increases and better working conditions everything but independent unions but when the vote is taken management has packed the committee with party officials the terms are accepted and workers begin going home As thousands head for the gate Anna Walentynowicz, recently fired but now reinstated by the strike agreement reminds them that their settlement has abandoned other workers who have joined the strike. Walentynowicz: What about those who supported us? There were forty factories, what about these people? I felt ashamed and hopeless, what should we do? Narrator:Alina Pienkowska, the nurse, runs to the main gate and tries to stop the workers A small crowd gathers to listen as she pleads with them to stay Pienkowska: If we really want free trade unions if we really want an influence of management we should act in solidarity with the others that is to continue the strike Narrator: Thousands have gone home but a few hundred are persuaded by Alina's argument They will stay the night to keep the strike alive During that night they take a fateful decision to form an inter factory strike committee to represent all workers in all of Poland This committee will magnify their force a thousand times and create a base of popular power never before seen in communist Poland On Sunday morning, workers improvised a Catholic Mass inside the main gate thousands of townspeople gather outside The gate is decorated with flowers messages of support and a photograph of the Pope who is Polish It's an unexpected show of support for the strikers. Pienkowska: I had never expected that such a reaction from the citizens of Gdansk It gave me a lot of courage and energy to act because I realized that we were probably going to be able to achieve something The Inter-factory Strike Committee has published 21 demands a document that has galvanized workers in other cities one of them is a 27 year old electrician at a tractor factory near Warsaw, Zbigniew Bujak Bujak: Suddenly we learned about the strike in Gdansk we read the twenty-one demands and as we say in Poland we felt literally speaking like we caught God by the arm we suddenly felt that we had in our hands a tool which if we don't make a mistake must produce some wonderful fruit Narrator: In Gdansk, the strikers have spent the weekend inside the shipyard have been rewarded 15,000 workers now return and rejoin the strike The Inter-factory Strike Committee waits for a response to the twenty-one demands while they wait more factories join the strike They steadily gain leverage over a system that has never permitted the existence of a power separate from the Communist Party Everywhere workers follow the example set in Gdansk reducing risk by staying inside their workplaces. Bujak: We are not going out of the gate because there it is very easy for the authorities to provoke simply provoke and then introduce police and the military so we wanted to avoid that Bujak: we knew about the activities of Gandhi for example or what Martin Luther King did and we knew that these people, building the theory of nonviolent resistance, they won The second week begins Strikers are publishing a daily bulletin called Solidarity and making preparations for a long struggle Well you could say that inside the shipyard there was a second government of Poland we had the sense of humor about it We had the minister of Communication, the Minister of Social Welfare and salaries who gathered money a Minister of Finance who kept the money we gathered from various companies that we're coming here There was a Minister of Security who was responsible for all the security guards, defense of the fences and the food Everything worked like clockwork like a Swiss watch Narrator: Their patience has given them strength By the ninth day, the Inter factory Strike committee speaks for nearly half a million workers in 370 factories in every industry and region of Poland Government negotiators arrive at the shipyard, the long stalemate appears to be over Jerzy Kolodziejski, Provincial Governor of Gdansk was on the negotiating team Kolodziejski: Some people are clapping, here is the authorities the province governor entering the shipyard starting the negotiations others were swearing and booing and calling names I had no doubt I was going to see the sacrificial lamb Narrator: Workers demand that all discussions be broadcast over shipyard loudspeakers Polish news media must be allowed to cover the strike and talks The government has come to the bargaining table after ten days of stalling Kolodziejski: It all backfired it turned out that these ten days were used by the strikers to strengthen organizationally To strengthen the inter factory strike committee and to convince people that without negotiations with the committee, an end to the conflict is impossible Mieczysław Jagielski Poland's First Deputy Prime Minister faces Lech Walesa, a 37 year old electrician Jagielsk is accustomed to microphones and cameras Walesa describes himself as a simple worker following his heart The regime has called the strikers traitors Now the Deputy Prime Minister has been sent to negotiate with them The strike committee is cautious knowing that if they push too hard, the game will be lost and that Soviet military intervention is a real possibility Negotiators for the workers are in no hurry Having seized the initiative they go word by word over the language dealing with independent unions, brushing aside the government's eagerness to move on to other issues Kolodziejski: The tactics of the strikers were this we have to get agreement for free trade unions all the rest will follow Walesa said "Mister Prime minister let's not talk about these things these are details" "What we have to have as free trade unions" Narrator: During nearly two weeks of talks, Walesa reports regularly to the rank and file He seeks consensus with an openness unheard of in Poland's official unions Worker solidarity is not lost on their adversaries Kolodziejski: No previous strike was carried out under such-- so decisively with such will of victory and such consolidation the conviction that we have to leave this room victorious It was the conviction not only of the Inter Factory strike committee but of all the workers who surrounded us and the dozens of thousands of people who surrounded the shipyard All this had its effect, it softened us, frankly speaking it did Narrator: Idle factories create pressures that benefit the strikers In Gdansk, valuable machinery and unfinished chips are being held hostage Increasingly desperate to resume production the regime gradually accepts an accommodation On Sunday August 31, an agreement is ready to sign They have won pay raises, a five day work week, relaxed press censorship, free trade unions and the right to strike Bujak: Seeing these accords being signed we immediately realized this is the first stage and it is only now that the real race against time against the clock begins for us and the real tactical intellectual struggle with the other party when those in power is beginning because it was obvious to us that they were signing their courts but they will immediately want to break them Narrator: The race against time begins as Walesa and Walentinovich tour the country to celebrate their success, recruit new members and create hundreds of affiliated local unions In four months, Solidarity membership grows to 10 million explicitly concerned with the welfare of Polish working people Solidarity can't avoid an obvious reality it's very existence challenges the supremacy of the Communist Party Bujak: I was feeling that from the very beginning the other side was preparing to hit us but when they were ready to hit 100 organizations by that time they were a thousand organizations when they got prepared to hit the 1000 it was not one thousand it was ten thousand it was not a hundred thousand members but a million and later 10 million Narrator: They must grow quickly becoming big enough that when the inevitable backlash comes, Solidarity will be too powerful to destroy Union activists are harassed, their newspapers censored, offices raided Workers are ordered to work two Saturdays a month an open breach of the agreement Solidarity fights back Narrator: A year after it was founded the union reelects Walesa as president but Solidarity's open democratic structure makes it vulnerable to its own extremists and to infiltrators There were some agents you can hear them on the tapes even now who are pouring oil on the flames saying to make a demonstration in Warsaw, gather a hundred thousand, two hundred thousand people and then hand-to-hand fighting Obviously there was no other course for the authorities either give up power and start democratic elections or tanks and put us in prison On the night of December 12, 1981 Communist authorities raid a conference of Solidarity's national leaders The entire presidium is arrested in its hotel In the next two days, Solidarity activists are rounded up by the thousands Martial law is declared on December 13th Walesa: At the moment when they hit us, I said this, "right at this moment you have lost we are winning" "and you have driven the last nails into your communist coffin" Narrator: Martial law is an admission that the regime has lost the people's consent Relying solely on the power to prohibit the regime has lost all ability to persuade Though the union is banned, popular support for it is undiminished Solidarity becomes a nonviolent resistance movement infused with a sense of Polish patriotism Stripped of essential leadership, Solidarity lives on in thousands of small organizations Too many to crush An underground press unifies them as they both resist and ignore state power Walesa: I knew this was my method to fight I am not afraid of you You can lock me up, you can kill me but you cannot defeat me So the struggle will continue, it will last some time, it will cost but we shall win Narrator: For seven years repression creates the appearance of stability but below the surface, the foundation is rotting In summer 1988, it collapses as price increases, food lines and rationing paralyzed the country A new wave of strikes is beyond the government's ability to control The regime offers to re-legalize Solidarity if Lech Walesa will negotiate an end to the strikes Within three days the country is back at work Solidarity has proven itself a capable and responsible force In February 1989, Solidarity, the government, the party and the church begin roundtable talks on Poland's future After two months of negotiations they agree on free unions, a free press and parliamentary elections In a two-month campaign, Solidarity candidates are popular but no one expects them to dislodge the Communist Party On June 4th 1989, Poland votes in the first open democratic elections in more than 60 years That night in the square outside Lech Walesa's apartment the victory is celebrated Solidarity has defeated the Communist Party by a margin of 10 to 1 Walesa: If they just opened a small crack in these doors to freedom I put my working class foot in those doors and they won't close them Narrator: Spring 1983, For nearly ten years General Augusto Pinochet has ruled Chile unchallenged Seguel: We needed someone to dare to say to the dictator that he was a dictator and to say that the a dictatorship was a dictatorship and confronted on its own turf not on the turf of arms just to dare to tell him that what we had in Chile was wrong and that it had to be changed Narrator: Pinochet Chet came to power in a 1973 coup the left the elected socialist President Salvador Allende dead Arriagada: During his first months of the military regime the number of people detained in prisons reached more than forty thousand at three thousand individuals were assassinated, executed or their bodies disappeared forever Narrator: Through ruthlessly eliminating any challenge to his authority Pinochet's rule casts fear into every corner of Chilean life Sagaris: It was a very permeating paranoia and it was with everyone everybody had experienced some sort of oppression in their family they were very cautious My husband and I would go to a social gathering and he wouldn't introduce me to anyone and I said "well why won't you introduce me to people?" He said "oh we don't do that now it's too dangerous you really you don't really want to know people's names" Bitar: Fear, terror if you have people afraid you can control them and Pinochet if something he will live in history, he's the man of terror executions disappearances and prisons keep the dictatorship in power for ten years By 1983, a severe economic crisis has pushed unemployment to 30% as Chileans feel they have nothing left to lose open opposition to the regime becomes thinkable for the first time The first signs of opposition appear at the heart of Chile's economy in the copper mines of the Andes Mountains Miners are amongst Chile's best paid workers in the country's largest and most lucrative export industry Their leader is 29-year-old Rudolfo Seguel a payroll clerk at Chile's largest copper mine recently elected president of the National Labor Congress Seguel wants his members to take the first step, a nationwide strike Seguel: Ten years had gone by and nobody had gone out into the street we had to see what reaction the country would have and then to see if the country would dare to do this our goal was to open people's eyes and to tell them we can do it it is possible, we can do this! A week before the strike is to begin, Pinochet's troops surround the copper mines Seguel knows that there will be bloodshed if the strike goes forward They changed their plans instead of a strike they proclaim a national day of protest with only a few days to prepare, they must mobilize not just union members but the whole population Verdugo: I remember that morning you know at the beginning you didn't know if someone was walking slowly driving his car slowly or walking slowly on the sidewalk because he was just taking a walk or because they were protesting Until finally at noon it was so obvious it was so obvious that everything was it slower but then it was so evident that the city started to close down Narrator: As darkness falls no one knows whether the final overt act of protest will succeed At exactly 8:00 p.m. it begins tentatively at first Sagaris: And the next day there was a sense of sort of what did you do last night "did you see it?" "oh yes I was out banging my pots and pans with my neighbors" and so there was a real sense of complicity all of a sudden in a society where each human being had literally become a complete island Seguel: And the next day when the protests finished at the first meeting that we had we decided to have a protest every month and we did that during 9 or 10 months, every month a protest And that was chaos for the military regime because we didn't protest with arms that gave us more power Narrator: A mood approaching euphoria grows as the protests grow every month people start to believe that mass demonstrations alone will bring down the dictatorship Mainstream opposition protests are strictly nonviolent Brutal police repression of the monthly demonstrations seems intended to intimidate to stop the movement but it has no effect In early August, one day before the fourth protest is scheduled Pinochet installs a new interior minister, Sergio Jarpa Jarpa is instructed to begin a dialogue with the opposition In a contradictory gesture on the same day Pinochet deploys thousands of troops in the streets of the capital an ominous prelude to the next day's demonstrations Security forces break up the August protests with unprecedented force The police statement admits that 17 civilians have been killed the actual number is much higher Valdes: It was very violent and that's when I realized that we couldn't keep on going down this road because the violence was too strong Pinochet had 16,000 soldiers on the streets of Santiago more than 80 people were killed and the population started to rebel Shocked by the bloodshed the new Cardinal of Chile's Catholic Church offers to host the dialogue that Pinochet has promised Jarpa: At the first meeting Gabriel Valdes told me that he had to give me a document and I told him that I would not take this document because it is an agreement that you drop this morning demanding the resignation of the President of the Republic Then you don't recognize him as being legitimate and if the President of the Republic is not the legitimate president I have nothing to do here because I represent him so this is where it all ends right here As Pinochet celebrates his birthday in November he has stopped Sergio Jarpa's meetings with the opposition Jarpa's small concessions, limited political activity the return of exiles and urns to book censorship were too much for the general--the dialogue is over No there wasn't any result it was very frustrating The regime didn't change at all And Jarpa himself was left there as a politician with no importance in fact the control of the government passed on to much harder hands Opposition groups have been naive to think that Pinochet would negotiate negotiate an end to his own power Protesters have not loosened the dictators grip but they have shown Pinochet they cannot be crushed by force and they have opened up political space they will use to organize against him In late November 1985, half-a-million attend the largest political rally in Chilean history Gabriel Valdes speaks for eleven opposition parties and the Catholic Church The National Accord formed to lead a nonviolent transition to democracy Valdes warns if we don't support the National Accord we are heading towards civil war In Chile's poor neighborhoods, the poblacións, a low-intensity war has already begun Hard times have fallen hardest here making fertile ground for Chile's Marxist and Communist parties not many have personally taken up arms but the ideology of violent revolution is accepted the regime sees the poblacións as enemy territory Young men in the poblacións are rounded up interrogated in stadiums and fields and hauled off to prison without trial hundreds are never seen again Pinochet's human rights abuses have drawn the normally conservative Catholic Church into the conflict though the clergy takes no political position the church protests against the torture killings and disappearances and preaches nonviolent methods Precht: If you use violence then you have to have the force to defend yourself whatever you impose through violence you have to defend through violence that's why we think that violence is the strength of the weak because they don't have arguments they don't have moral authority so whatever you achieve through violence you have to defend through violence Monthly protests turned violent as the radicals confront police handing Pinochet the excuse he needs to come down on all opposition Mainstream factions are harshly criticized for their nonviolent methods and those conditions when you are repressed by violence of course there are people that think that the only way to face violence is through violence but that was in our understanding absolute absolutely out of any possibility of succeeding In late summer of 1986, the prospect of full-scale civil war becomes real Chilean intelligence uncovers a cache of arms in the northern desert and traces them to a guerrilla group affiliated with the Chilean Communist Party Markings show the weapons have come from Cuba Pinochet says it's proof that his opponents are preparing a revolution A few weeks later heavily armed guerillas attacked General Pinochet's motorcade on a remote mountain road state news media report that five presidential guards have died but do not mention Pinochet Four hours later, the dictator appears on television to describe the attack He appears unfazed by his narrow escape and returns to the presidential palace with his customary swagger the episode reinforces his image of invincibility It really polarized I think between you know are we gonna go for a really serious aren't attempt at armed struggle the way we've seen in Central America with a huge toll on human lives and suffering that was part of that or are we gonna try to find some other way which was very nebulous and so this search began to find some way that could provide some kind of an exit from this impasse Pinochet's own Constitution calls for a plebiscite. In 1988, giving Chileans the right to vote yes or no to another eight years of military government isolated and overconfident, Pinochet always assumed he would win but after five years of organizing the nonviolent opposition sees an opportunity For the first time we knew that if Pinochet was going to remain in power there is going to be a plebiscite and you have to say yes or no therefore we say look if we prepare ourselves, we can defeat Pinochet saying "no" We said "how are we going to trust the dictator that has been doing all these things and he will count the votes that he count the votes as the votes are but we realized that we had no other way and we said let's move ahead in that direction and let's create all the conditions to avoid any fraud Narrator: Thousands of volunteers take to the countryside in a door-to-door campaign to convince Chileans that they can vote uno without fear of reprisal and that the results will not be rigged they are greeted with suspicion and skepticism to create the appearance of a fair vote finish yet and the generals right new election laws any opposition party that can collect thirty five thousand signatures will be allowed to have poll watchers a critical factor to prevent vote fraud and be given 15 minutes of television time every night for four weeks before the voting And I said "look if you register I'm going to be on TV" And the day that I'm going to be on TV, I will tell Mr. Pinochet that he has to go After his party is certified, Lagos gets his chance when he appears on the Chilean equivalent of Meet the Press He holds up a newspaper clipping in which Pinochet is quoted saying he will not be a candidate in the plebiscite His daring performance makes Ricardo Lagos a celebrity overnight And his performance foreshadows the significance of television in the coming no campaign Pinochet's vulnerability is human rights.The "no" campaign bans television spots to emphasize torture death and prison But US political consultants advise them consultants advise them that dwelling on the fears of the past would be a turn-off They developed a a campaign that was future-oriented, a campaign that focused on bread-and-butter issues and and it was a campaign that ultimately caught the Pinochet regime and the supporters of the yes vote by complete surprise when it was aired on the first night in that in in that last 30 days of the campaign That no what was meaning yes to democracy was meaning yes to more social justice and not no to injustice ..meaning joy is around the corner it was an invitation to a country that belonged to everyone the idea that we were going to defeat the dictatorship not with a gun but a pencil that this road was going to be traveled without hate without rancor without vengeance On television, the no campaign is a sensation images of a bright future without Pinochet. The TV spots earn credibility with skeptical viewers with compelling references to the suffering inflicted by the dictatorship people used to rush home to watch those spots I used to what rush home to watch the spots it was like you know 15 minutes where you know they use real words to say real things you know torture is torture and and it happened here and after all these years of denial there it was for the first time on - poverty exists Little old ladies don't even have enough money in their purses to buy a tea bag for their afternoon tea Opposition poll watchers now perform a parallel vote count based on sampling techniques by fax and telephone the numbers are fed to computers in Santiago By early evening they project the" no" as won decisively A small independent radio station announces the results ensconced in the presidential palace Pinochet says nothing Suspicions of electoral fraud grow as hours past with no announcement of the vote tally At midnight, Pinochet's Navy, Air Force and police commanders enter the palace General Fernando Matthei Air Force Commander tells reporters it appears the "no" has won a public statement that warns Pinochet to accept the defeat within seconds his remarks are on the radio The great strength was that it did really come from ordinary, extraordinary people and they really did put their lives on the line and they really did come out and they really were willing to take a stand I think that we are in the world we really live on power and where we would like to is to live on authority, personal authority, moral authority, when you act based on power but if I have a gun pointed at me I'm going to say whatever you think and you want after you take your gun off my head and it'll do what I want You see how people live that moment and they leave me without hatred, convinced that they have been the participants, the actors Here came here there was no charismatic leader, no guerrilla, no vanguard that would say "I did this" The sense in Chile that night was that they had done it themselves how many? seven million
