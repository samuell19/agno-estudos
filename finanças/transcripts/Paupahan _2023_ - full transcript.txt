Okay, pose. And... Turn... That's good. Smile. Side. Okay, to your right. Smile. Thank you, boys. Have you checked it out? I'll go today. You want some breakfast? No need. I'm going. Looks like we have a new boarder! Good luck, bro. Hello? Is this the room for rent in Guadalupe? I'm here now. May I see the room? Okay. Fuck, bro. I woke up late. My alarm was useless! Did you call? Yes, I did. Are you the owner? I am. Wow, you're young. Come inside. I'll show you the room. Right here. Can I check the room? Sure, let's go upstairs. Let's go to the room. Alright. Looks nice. How much? The rent is eight thousand pesos. Way expensive. Can I haggle? That's the instruction to me. Please? Sorry. How about four thousand pesos? Well... Fine. I was right! You're kind! Nice! Do I keep the aircon unit? Sorry, the aircon doesn't work. But you may open the blinds. Looks cozy. Nice. Your apartment looks neat. How much? Four thousand. What a steal! Any vacant room? I have no idea. The rent is originally doubled... But the owner seems fond of me. Figures! Is that a girl or a gay person? A girl, of course. You're a magnet! Even to old women. - Fool, she's so young! - How young? Around twenty. She's gullible, then. Dumbass, don't you trust me? Idiot. Take care of this. Analyn... you're there. Here's your key and the duplicate for the gate. Thanks. Analyn. He's Paolo. He's my friend and a colleague in modeling. Hi. Paolo. Do you need assistance for your stuff? No, thanks. We're fine. We carried everything already. How about cleaning the room? - No, thanks. I don't want to bother you. - It's no big deal. Are you sure? If you insist. Maybe after we unpack. I'll just prepare some snacks for you. No need. We're good. Don't bother. It's really okay. Alright, then. Thanks. Later. Your landlady is one weirdo. She's gullible, anyway. Hey, guys. - Hi, bro. - Jiad. - Hello! - What's your name? Joan. - Hi. - Nicole. - Is it your first time here? - Yes. I see. I'm always here and I've never seen you, guys. Excuse me? - Nico Catapang? - That's me! - This way, please. - Bye, guys. What happened to you? Shit, man. Asked to go home. What's new? That's life! I really need money, man. I've been jobless for so long. Doesn't she send money to you? That's the thing. What if she asks about the money? About where I spend it? Why don't you look for another job? That would prove I can't succeed here. I fought for this. Damn it. Dude, look. I know, right! Can't you ask for money from your brother? From that bastard? I'll never ask him for help. What's your plan, then? Come what may. I'll find a way. Analyn, what's the matter? I cooked extra food... - So I thought of sharing it. - This apartment's making me paranoid. I better move out next week. Come in. What happened here? That's nothing. Paolo and I had some drinks last night. Have a seat. I can clean it up. Thanks, but I can manage. Don't bother. It's not a bother at all. Well... I'll eat first, then I'll help you out. Take a seat. Oh, I forgot! I have to run an errand later. I can take care of this once I go home. I can do it. Are you sure? Yeah. Alright. Thanks. I'll make it up to you. Why do you have a lot of vitamins? Nah. Don't mind those. Just ignore it. Let's eat. You cook really well! Grandma! Grandma, wake up! Grandma. Grandma... Time to eat. By the way, we have a new tenant. He's so handsome and kind! He said I cook really well. I'll introduce him to you. For sure, you will like him too. Let's eat. Let me help you. Delicious, right? I cooked thatâ€” You need to drink your meds. Here we go again. We keep on auditioning for nothing. That's old news. We wanted this. It's not like that. I get nothing for doing this forever. Then quit. What a jerk! You keep on complaining as if you don't take home girls. Nah. Look at last night. I told you... I need to refresh. To relieve myself from stress. Wish I could have that too! It won't be a surprise if your landlady is next. Speaking of which, before I left, she passed by my room. She brought food and even cleaned. See that? She must be obsessed with you. Be careful. No need. She's just thoughtful. I can't figure her out. Hopefully, she does it again later. With her, I don't have to fend for myself. - Next. - It's your turn. You have to hold the bottle, look at the camera and you have to smile. Show the bottle, promote the bottle, and then smile. Okay. I also need a drinking shot, alright? You know, it feels weird when you don't sleep over. Stop flattering me! I'm dead serious. I feel different. What if I move out? What are you doing? I'm just fixing this. It was askew. Okay... What's that? As a thank-you. Don't bother! Take it. I bought it for you. I cleaned up your room already and I threw the sleeping pills. What? They were all over the place! Analyn, those are expensive. Why did you throw them? Sorry. I really need those meds to sleep well. It's fine. I apologize for meddling. Is that for me? I bought too many for me and my grandma. Thank you. By the way, is there a nearby laundry shop? My used clothes have piled up. Can you accompany me? It's ten minutes away. I almost forgot! Paolo and I have a gig tomorrow. I can take care of your clothes. Just finish your work. No, no. You've done so much. It's totally fine. I feel embarrassed. I'll take care of it. It's fine. Okay. I'll take them outside before I leave tomorrow. Sure. Thanks again. Good night. Hello? Yeah. Why aren't you answering my calls? So busy at work. Sorry. I called multiple times. Wrong timing! I sent the money. I'll receive it tomorrow. My friend over there in the Philippines has a business proposal. A car wash business. They'll provide the equipment. I was thinking if you could manage it in your spare time. The nature of my work is spontaneous. It would be hard to manage that. We've talked about this, haven't we? I know. But until when will you have that work? What if you don't have any projects? What would be your source of income? Don't you trust me? I trust you but... Then trust me. That's all I'm asking. Is that difficult? Sorry. How is the apartment? It's good. It's spacious. I haggled over the rent. That's nice. Good thing the owner agreed. The owner is kind. How about your stuff? All good. Paolo helped me unpack. Oh right, I was able to book a flight. Really? For when? For next week. Friday. Can't wait. Okay, next? Face to the left. Okay... Face the camera. Okay, okay. Nico, face your right. Face to the camera. Smile. Okay. Face to the camera. Give me your best smile. Okay, Lawrence. Hands on your waist. Okay. Okay. You may remove it. Turn around. Okay. Okay. Hands on your waist. Flex your body. Smile. Turn to your right. Your right. - I'm sorry. - It's okay. Just relax. Smile. Flex your body. Okay. Keep it calm. How will I calm down? I get nothing from casting. She's flying back home. When? Next week. All of a sudden? Yeah. She's trying to catch you in the act. No. She's not like that. You know... We better have some drinks. I need to de-stress too! Sorry, I have to pass. I'm not in the mood. Come on, I rarely invite! And you're going to reject me? I'm just not in the mood. I want to rest at home. I can drive you. Don't bother. - Thank you. - Take care. My name is Nelson. Bro, Emman. I'm an HR manager over there. - I see. - How about you? I'm reviewing for my board exam next month. For architecture. Alright. Nico! Analyn. I got your laundry. Thanks a lot. Yeah. By the way... Are you busy tonight? Not really. Why? Do you want to hang with me in my room? - Alright. - Let's go. Come in. Want some drinks? Sure. Anything. Beer? Sure. - Here. - Thank you. Cheers. What's the matter? It's bitter. I don't drink beer. Ah! That's how the first time goes. Will anyone mind that you're here now? No one. Grandma's asleep. I helped her take her meds. How about your boyfriend? I don't have one. But you're beautiful though! I'm beautiful? I don't even dress well. No one will like me. Let me take a look. I'm right. You're beautiful. You might not see what I see in you. You don't like it? Sorry, Nico. I'll go ahead. I'm sorry. Hi. Do you need anything? None. I just want to say sorry about last night. I brought some food. I thought you're with your grandma. She's in her room. She just ate. What's that? Nothing. It's grandma's meds. Okay. You live with just your grandma? Yes. So these are your parents. Where are they? They're already gone. I'm sorry. It's okay. I was still a kid when they died. My grandma Esther took care of me. My grandmother is the owner of this house. She doesn't have a child so I manage this place. Is she sick? She's a quadriplegic. She fell from the stairs and hit her head. She hardly moves, eats, and talks. Your grandmother is lucky to have you. I owe her a lot. How about you? Where are your parents? I'm sorry. I don't mean to pry. No. We're just not on good terms. Why? They see me as a troubled child, a black sheep. A black sheep? They have their favorite. My brother. He's the better, kinder, smarter guy. He's an architect now, while I'm auditioning forever. It's as if that jerk is a saint. Did he do that? They blame me for my father's death. Why do they blame you? My father and I fought. That caused his heart attack. They can't forgive me. That's why I attempted to... Good thing, Ma was there. I'm really sorry... about last night. I just have a lot going on. Do you have a problem? Not really. Ma is coming home. She doesn't know my work is a pain in the ass. Why? She wants me to follow her to Canada... Get a job there since they pay more. Do you want to go there? No, I'm better off in the Philippines. Anyway, give me your hand. Why? Wait for it. What's that? Just to thank you... What an artist! Here's a rose, while I don't have the actual one. Wait! Hold on. Why? Your grandma might hear us. It's okay. Wait. Don't you want it? - Maybe next time. - Nico. Nico! Nico! Grandma, he's our new tenant. His name is Nico. He confessed last night that he likes me. But he had to leave. You know, he's such a gentleman! Choosing him was the right thing. But you know what? I pity him. Because... His "Ma" doesn't support him. If we become a couple, I'll always support him. Even without her "Ma," I can give him everything. Every single thing. Fuck you two! Shit! Hi Analyn! Who were you with last night? What? I saw the two of you kissing. That... I thought I'm the only one you like. Why are you seeing someone else?! Are you just playing with me? Analyn... Look. I do like you. But this is wrong. I'm your tenant. My head is troubled that time. Please forgive me for what I did. You're a good person. You don't deserve a guy like me. Analyn, I'm sorry. You're so stupid! Sorry, Grandma. Our dinner with Nico is not pushing through. I know you're excited to meet him. It's my fault! If I didn't say no, he wouldn't have looked for someone else! It's really my fault! He wouldn't have misinterpreted my actions! He thought I didn't like him. The truth is, I like him so much! I just need some time to breathe. Grandma... Sorry. I'm sorry. Here. Drink this. Drink! Drink! Don't worry... We'll still end up together. Fuck it, Nico! Where's your libido?! Shit! I'm late again! - Nico. - Analyn? What time are you coming home? Why? Do you want to eat here later? I don't have time today. I also need to clean. I can clean your room for you. Are you sure? Thanks. I need to take a bath. I'm in a hurry. Here's my fare. Thanks. Excuse me, Ma'am. What do you need? I'm just waiting for someone. Someone from this apartment? Yes, from Unit 3D. Do you know him? I'm the landlady. Hi! My name is Katherine. Nico's fiancÃ©e. Analyn. Nice to meet you, Analyn. Would it be okay if you open the gate? I've been calling Nico but he's not answering. He wasn't able to fetch me from the airport. Hon! Hon, you're here! Hi! This is Analyn, our landlady. Yeah, we've met. What took you so long? Sorry, I ran. The signal is bad upstairs. - Let's come inside. - Yeah. - You need some rest. - Sure. We'll go ahead, Analyn. It's been a while. I missed you. Is this the apartment? I thought it's big! It's not bad. I'm paying ten thousand for this. It's just a room! I thought it's the whole apartment. Hon, you can't find something large and cheap in this area. It's in the city. You can take somewhere expensive. Look around. I'll handle it. I'm okay here. This is near the agency I frequent. Save the money for our wedding. You're grumpy. What's the matter? Why didn't you fetch me from the airport? You're not answering my calls. I'm sorry! I was called for a final casting. Plus, my signal here is bad. Well, it's fine. By the way, your landlady was glaring at me. Oh well. She's always like that. Paolo had the same first impression. It's as if I were some kind of a suspect, especially when you approached me. Don't mind her. What matters now is that we're together here. I don't like it here. Tomorrow, I'll look for a different place. We can stay there until I leave. What for?! Hon, we don't have privacy here. This feels like a students' dorm. The rest of the tenants have left. We're alone and we can do anything we want. Why do you like it here? It's not like that. I just want to save up for our own house. You can place your makeup kit over there. What's the matter? Does Nico Catapang live here? Yes, but he's not around. We just have some questions. What about? He was the last person seen with Ms. Anna Mendoza. She's been missing for days now. You might have seen her with Nico Catapang. No, I haven't. Alright. We'll just come back to ask him. Oh, honey! - I want Chopsuey. - Chopsuey? - I miss the way you cook chopsuey. - Alright, later. Analyn! By the way, can I use your kitchen tonight? No problem. There. Thanks. I want to cook for Nico. You know, it's been a while. You want to join us? Hon, you can see she's busy. I'd like to cook for you if you're free tonight. Nico told me you used to share your food. It's about time we return the favor. Sure. Perfect. 7 PM later. Okay. Let's go. Pardon my mess in the kitchen. Promise, I'll clean up later. Just a sec. Let's dig in. - Let's eat, hon. - Okay. - Hon, chicken? - Okay. To be honest, I was surprised you're the landlady. You're too young! Actually, I'm not the owner of this building. My grandma got sick, so I was tasked to manage this. I'm sorry to hear that. Her grandmother is quadriplegic. She fell from the stairs and hit her head. Wow, you know that! We usually talk about things. We talk when there's time. He told me so. Thanks for everything you did. You've been a big help to him. He's not good with household chores. He's swamped with work. That's fine. I just want to help him. No one else can. Thank you so much! If Nico brings a girl here, tell me right away! I don't! I'm not like that, Before we were together, he was such a womanizer. Dress up a post with a skirt and he'll flirt with that. Hon, you know I changed. Analyn, did Nico ever bring a girl here? He didn't. Nico is such a good tenant. How long have you been together? It's been a while. Five years. Three years in a long distance relationship. Imagine, we made it through. Of course. We're a strong couple, aren't we? Your dishes are so good. I didn't expect we'd survive LDR. What's your job over there? I'm a nurse in Canada. I told Nico to come with me and work over there. Why didn't he come? He wanted to stay here in the Philippines, and he can't leave modeling. I have nothing to do there. I know many people here. We discussed that, didn't we? You said you're okay with it. Yeah. I supported you. Good thing you got through LDR. I agree. Before I flew, I talked to him. I need an assurance before we continue our relationship. I guess he can't let me go. Before I knew it, he proposed to me before I left for Canada. You don't need to narrate that. Why not? Don't you want her to know that you're the one who pursued? That's one beautiful love story. Yeah. You know, I only have Nico in my life. I don't have a family. Katherine was 12 years old when her parents died. Her sister was the only one who took care of her. Now that my sister has her own family, she has become busy. They migrated to the US. Nico and I talked about settling down. I sent all my salary to him... so he could sort out buying our house here. So you're the one who pays for his rent. For now! I understand the nature of his work. He rarely gets a project. Also... we're also planning for our wedding. After that, I will stay here for good. Is that so? - Vegetables? - Thank you. Grandma... Nico is making a fool out of me. He has a fiancÃ©e. She's the one paying for his rent here. I thought I was the only one he likes. I'm so stupid! I did everything for him! Everything he wants, everything he needs. Everything meant nothing. He just fooled around! I thought he was different. He's like any other man! Fuck, bro. I woke up late. My alarm was useless! This apartment is crazy! I better move out next week. They leave me hopeless. - It feels weird when you don't sleep over. - Stop flattering me! I'm dead serious. I'm so stupid! Grandpa, don't! Stop resisting! Have mercy! This feels good! Hey! Analyn! What is this? What's this abomination? Your adopted child entered my room and took off her clothes. That's not true. He asked me to come here. Don't lie! You know the truth! I raised you! Animal! What an animal! It hurts! It hurts? Disgusting! Ouch! It hurts! Disgusting! Shameless! What are you doing? You're peeping! Tenants are leaving because they're mad at you! Because you're disgusting! You keep peeping! Get this. I don't want to see your face again! Do you understand? Get out! Get out! I helped and raised you! Animal! You're the animal! You're the animal! I'm so stupid! So stupid! - What was that? - Is there someone else? That's nothing. I heard something. You're just tired. Come here. You think of a lot of things. What's that? Don't bother. Hon. Hon. What is it? There must be someone in the other room. I'm sleeping. That's nothing. I heard something. Take a look. I'm sleeping, hon! Hon! Hon! Someone's calling. It might be important. I'm sleeping! Hello? Hi! Is Nico there? He hasn't been contacting me. Who's this? Who are you? Are you his mom? Why should you care, anyways? This is not his mother, this is his fiancÃ©e. Oh, I see. Katherine! Good thing you're here! I need to ask a favor. Sure, what's that? - You're a nurse, right? - Yes. My grandma has been ill, and she can't eat well. Can you check her? I can, but it would be better if we call her doctor. Her doctor is on a vacation. That's the only one I trust. Letâ€™s do it this way. I'll take a look and I'll accompany you to the hospital if needed. Alright? - Sure. - Okay. - Let's go. - Let's go. Why is it dark here? There are no lights? There was a blackout. I see. Come in. Nico! Why is no one here? Why are the lights turned off? Everyone left. They left me. What? The last remaining tenant left. Where is Kath? She left for a while. She asked you to wait here. Come, let's have some juice. Did Kath really leave? Don't you believe me? You know, I was surprised when I learned you have a fiancÃ©e. - I thought weâ€™re done with that? - We're done, yes. I'm just telling you. I thought you were hurt because of me. The truth is that you have a sugar mommy in Canada! Analyn, snap out of it! Just a sec, I'll get your juice! You bitch! If you didn't flirt Nico, you wouldn't have been here! Bitch! You're awake. I'll just correct your wrongdoings. Don't worry. I'm not mad at you. I'll just get rid of people who hinder our relationship! Remember... you kept on staring at me when the three of us ate together? I know that very well! I can handle it. Oh! Katherine! You're awake. Haven't I told you... Nico and I had a relationship? Remember when you asked me if he has ever brought a girl here? Of course, he has! Every single time! But at the end of the day, it's me he looks for, when his girls can't make him happy. You bitch! You think you can separate us? You can't take him away from me! What did you like about her? What does she have that I don't? I gave you everything! I gave everything you need! What else do you want? You're no different from those guys! Liars! Cheaters! I served you! I forgave you for bringing those girls here! I'm beautiful, am I not? Can't you see that? Cheater! Liar! You will never change! You bitch! You're a bitch! Bitch! We would like to inquire about your room for rent.
