(tires screeching) (crash) - Anyone call 911?! - Stand back! - Anyone call 911? - Send paramedics right away! Please hurry! (ambulance dispatcher) - 10-8 unit 23 en route to scene. (siren) - [We have a second ambulance joining you.] (sirens) - Check the other car! - We need someone over here, please! - Oh, my God! That's Andrew! Andrew, it's okay. I'm here. - Back it up! - You know him? - He's my husband. You're still here. - Yeah. Coles and Brinks are gonna cover for us. They send their best. - That's so nice of them. Thanks. - Any news? - Still waiting to hear. - We finally got him stabilized. You can go and see him now. I'll be in in a minute. - Okay. I'm so glad you're okay. I was so worried. - How are the... people in the other car? They okay? - 21-year-old girl. Died at the scene. I'm pretty sure she was above the legal limit. - Okay. - Someone's pretty sure that they saw her run the red light. - I'll leave you guys to it. - Andrew. How are you feeling? - Can't really feel much of anything at the moment, so... I'm guessing the painkillers are working pretty good. - Well, you should buy a lottery ticket. As I told your wife, you were very lucky. Contusions and torn ligaments, two broken ribs, which will heal on their own. I'm more concerned about a spleen hematoma, so I've ordered a CT scan. - If my spleen's okay, I'm to expect a full recovery, though, right? - Eventually, yeah. Broken ribs do take a while to heal, so it may be uncomfortable or even painful to sit for long periods. - You mean like in a car? - It's okay. We'll figure it out. It's okay. - Relaxed people recover better. Just focus on healing. - It's okay. - What are you gonna do now that Andrew's basically unemployed? - I have no idea. - What about your mom's life insurance? - How do you think we got a down payment on this place? - So sell it. Downsize. You don't need three bedrooms. - No, the market's changed a lot since we bought. We'd lose a lot of money. Besides, I can't imagine moving with Andrew laid up. - I know what you should do! Rent out one of your spare rooms on Vacay 'N Stay. My co-worker Ellie rents one of her spare rooms and she makes four grand a month, more than her mortgage. - No. - Why not? - Because I don't want random strangers as roommates? - It's not like that. You can screen your guests and handpick the ones you like. - No. What are you doing? - 125 times 2... That's what you'd be making a month. - No way. - Mm-hmm. So, if you look here, you can click on a particular guest and see what the hosts have to say about them. For example, there are six hosts here that liked this guest. "He's a great guest. We liked having him stay", yadda yadda yadda. And if you have a bad experience with a guest, you can report them by clicking here. - Hm. So I get to check them out before I... agree to let them stay here? - Before you host them, yeah, exactly. Oh, and your money's deposited right into your account after they check in, so you don't have to collect it. - This is sounding a lot cooler than I thought. - Like I said, my friend Ellie makes a lot of money doing it. It allowed her to go down to part-time. She makes more money doing this than she did when she was working full-time. (birds chirping) - There you are. I've finally found you. (door opening) - What are you cooking off? - Nothing. You know, you were supposed to be here over an hour ago. - I was with Devin. He said he saw you getting real cozy with some long-haired guy at the club last night. You sleeping with that guy? - Oh, gimme a break! I'm so over this. - Answer the question, stupid slut! What is on that computer you don't want me to see? You bitch! Ah! You know how much this cost me? - Take it out of the $2,000 you owe me. God, you're such a loser. - I'm a loser? - Yeah. - What about you? You're nothing but a low-rank skank! - Oh, I'm a low-rank skank? - Think you're important 'cause you roll around on stage, guys throw a couple bucks at you? Nothing but a dirty, nasty little slut. (grunting) - I disagree, Ryan. - Up to $4,000 extra a month. It's actually so much better than I thought. - Oh, come on, you don't wanna let some weirdo come and stay with us. - No, I wanna rent out two of our rooms to clean, responsible, mature adults. We don't really have much of a choice. We have to do something. Two of our credit cards are maxed. I had to go into our savings for our mortgage, and in another month I'm gonna have to cash out the IRA. Even just for a little bit, until we figure out what you're gonna do for a job. - Okay, alright, let's give it a shot. But if we get even one weirdo, we're closing it down for good. - Please give me a good guest. Soon. (sinister music) (gasping softly) - I'm surprised you were able to talk Andrew into doing this. You know he hates having other people in his space. - No, I think it's just a big brother thing. - Ha ha. - Like it or not, we didn't have much of a choice. Could be months until he's back to work. (computer chiming) I hope it's someone booking in a reservation. Check it out, I've got two people booked in. One for two days and one for five. And then I have someone else who wants to stay for eight days. - Wow, eight days! What's she coming into town for? - Uh, work. Miranda, from Portland. She's never done Vacay 'N Stay before, but it does look like she's done a lot of traveling. There's pictures of her in France, the DR... - She's cute. What does she do for work? - This is not a dating service. - Who says I need a service? - Get out. - She'll be here for work? - Yeah, she's a trainer at the Daxon Hotels. They're opening a new one next month, so she's gonna train everyone. - So she works at a hotel but she's staying at a Vacay 'N Stay? - I said the same thing. She said she gets up early and would rather stay with people than be alone, so... I guess if you travel all the time you get really lonely. - [23, we have a 914A] [at 3320 Lowell Avenue. Male juvenile, unresponsive.] - 10-8 23 on the way. (siren) - So, like, what am I supposed to tell your regulars when they ask about you? - Tell 'em some rich Arab asked me to marry him and I said yes. (chuckling) Thanks for letting me stay. Hasta la vista. - What? You're leaving already? Your flight's at 12:30. - Yeah, well, I have some place to stop by first. - Um, isn't this Ryan's place? - Yup. Keep it running. - Holy crap! Okay, Miranda, come on! Miranda, come on! Okay, you're insane. - Drive. - Hi! You must be Miranda. - That's me. - Come on in. - Thank you. - This is your room. - Oh, wow. It looks just like the pictures. - Um, the keys. So, these are for you to lock up after you leave. And I wrote down just a little list of rules... basically, no smoking, and you have access to everything except for the den and the master bedroom, and if you have any guests overnight, maybe just let me know first. - Yeah, sounds reasonable. - Okay. Do you want a coffee? I was gonna make some. - Yes, please. - Alright. I'll let you get settled. Just come down whenever you're ready. - Okay, thank you. Daxon owns 1,600 hotels nationwide, and when they open a new one, I go down for about a week and help train the staff. - I heard that they have one of the best pension programs in the hospitality business. - Is that your husband? - Yeah. That was on vacation two years ago in Punta Cana. - Oh, wow. What does he do? I think you mentioned it on your profile, but I forgot. - Pharmaceutical sales. Or he did. I don't know what he's gonna do now. - Oh, he get fired or something? - No, nothing like that. He was in a pretty bad car accident. He's still in the hospital. - Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry. Is he gonna be okay? - Yeah. Yeah, he hurt his ribs pretty badly and he has to sit a lot in the car for work, so... I don't know. - That's terrible. Well, let me know if there's anything I can do. - Thanks. I appreciate it. (sinister music) - Yes! (car chirping) One, two, three. - We're three for three with good renters. Should've done this months ago. - Yeah. So the new one got there? What's her name? - Miranda. - What's she like? - Nice. We talked for about an hour. She's never been to Philly and she wants a cheesesteak. - Cheesesteak... - Maybe if you're lucky I'll bring one for you. - I'm lucky. (laughing) - This is all working out. Aubrey was right. - Aww! You're cute. (siren) - She's in the kitchen! That way! - Three's a crowd, Wally. - I am so sorry about your mother. - She must've done it right after I left this morning. She was so depressed, I mean, I never should've left her alone. - I lost my mother to suicide as well. She was diagnosed with cancer and we decided we were gonna fight it, but she wanted to go to Mexico by herself, just to relax. She killed herself in her hotel room. Pamela, you cannot feel responsible for what has happened. They do it when they know that we will not be there to help them. Honey, this is in no way your fault. - Karen. - The detective needs to talk to you now, okay? - Okay. Thank you. (birds chirping) - What is all this? - Just my way of saying thank you for letting me stay. Okay, so, what kind of cheese do you like? American, Swiss, cheddar? - Wow. Um... Swiss. - Perfect. So how was work last night? I didn't even hear you come in. I was so tired. - Rough. - Really? What kind of calls? - Two car accidents, mostly nothing. Heart attack. The worst was a 20-year-old who lost her mother. She'd shot herself that morning. So young to lose your mother. (sighing) - I don't know how you do it, seeing all those dead bodies. I just see the littlest amount of blood and I'm, like, lightheaded. - No, those aren't the hard ones. They're already gone. It's when you want to save someone and you can't. That's what I lose the sleep over. I gotta get ready for work. I work nights tonight, but tomorrow night I'm off, if you wanna go to Michael's. The restaurant I was telling you about? - Yeah. Yeah, that would be great. Um, I finish training around four. - Alright, it's a date. Thanks again for lunch. - No problem. (engine choking) - What? Ugh! Ugh. - What's wrong? - I don't know. It's not working. It was fine last night. - Maybe it's the starter. - I don't know what it is, but I cannot do this right now. - Well, if you want, I can drive you. - You have a car? - Yeah, I have a rental right there. - Okay. - Yeah? Let's go. - Oh, crap. I forgot Andrew's paperwork. - What paperwork? - I left it right in the front entryway. It's some forms from his work. It's okay. I'm gonna call his brother, see if he can pick it up and maybe check on the car. - I'll do it. - No, no, I can't ask you to do that. - No, honestly, it's fine. I can do it right after work. It'll be, like, late afternoon, early evening, something like that. - Are you sure? - Please. Honestly, it's no problem. Just text me the hospital name and his room number and I'll do it. - Thanks. I owe you. - No problem. - Thanks for doing this. - Oh, yeah. No problem. Anything to help Karen out. She's been great. - Yeah, I'm pretty lucky. - Oh, well, she says the same about you. I saw pictures of you two vacationing and one with you and your brother, so I kinda feel like I know you. - Oh. Did she say any embarrassing stories about me? - No, no, no. It was all good. - Oh, that's good. - Yeah. So, um, you just have that one brother? - Yeah, Tyler. - Oh, must be nice. I was an only child growing up. - Oh, so was Karen. I think she always wanted a sister, though. - Oh, really? Yeah, me too. Yeah, my mom died from a rare bone disease, so, um... it was really awful. - I'm sorry to hear that. Did Karen tell you about her mom? - Mm-mm. - Well, I'll let her tell you, but she lost her mom about... about six months ago. - Was she sick? - Uh, I should probably let her tell you. - Yeah, no, of course. I feel like if anyone can handle death, it's Karen, in her line of work. - Well, it's very different when it's your own family. It was pretty devastating for her. Both of us, actually. Nancy was... she was a wonderful woman. - I was never close to my mom until the end. - Well, you know, tragedy has a way of bringing people closer together. - So true. Anyway, I should get going, so I'll let you rest. - Okay. - Yeah. - Good to finally meet you. - Yeah, it was good to meet you. So I'll see you later. - Yes, I'll see you at the house at some point. - Okay. Bye. - Bye. - Cheyenne? Cheyenne! Hey, girl! Are you trying to ignore me or what? - JoJo. What are you doing here? - You mean in Philly or at the hospital? - Uh, both. - I moved here about six weeks ago. Followed a guy, he ended up being married. Long story, boring. I got a job and I stayed. The hospital part's not as bad as it seems. I was visiting a friend who popped out a baby boy yesterday. So how about you? - I, um... I'm looking for work out here. I actually go by Miranda now. - Oh yeah? You give up on that glamorous life in Portland, huh? - Well, I'm not sure I would say that, but... (chuckling) - Yeah, I know. Hey, do you want to grab a drink? There's a place I like just up this street. I can drive. - Um... sure, yeah. - So, Miranda, huh? I'm so used to calling you Cheyenne. - I know. Why didn't you ever use a stage name? - What difference does it make? Most guys just call you baby anyways. - Yeah. - So what about you? Somebody told me you were doing time. - Ugh, that was a while ago. Had to spend three months in county for lifting a pair of heels. - Oh, that sucks. - Well worth it, yeah? (both laughing) Oh yeah. So where are you working at here? - Oh, I found this nice little joint called the Kitty Kat Room. It's the only strip club in that area. I make bank. - Oh, bank? Are they hiring? - I can totally set up an interview for you. That'd be amazing. - Really? - Yeah! - It was going so well... - Good morning. - Morning. I like your top. - Oh, thank you. You can borrow it anytime you'd like. - So I thought I'd prove to us both that I can make waffles, even though I burned the first two. - Is everything okay? You seem a little bit off today. - Yeah. I'm just trying to figure out this whole Vacay 'N Stay thing. Everything was going great, and now nothing. Just this one guy who's booked in for five days from Vancouver. - A guy from Vancouver? - Yeah, he was the first one that booked in. Said he's on some spiritual journey. - Hm! That's really cool. When is that happening? - Day after tomorrow. - Wow, these waffles look amazing. I'm definitely skipping lunch, 'cause I'm ready for our cheesesteaks tonight. - Oh, no. Tonight? - Yeah. It's Monday, right? - Right. Yeah, no, I just... I forgot that I told my friend Aubrey that I'd have dinner with her tonight. - Hm. Uh, can't you reschedule or something? No, I'm sorry, never mind. I don't want you to do that. Um, you know what? Just text me the place and I'll find it. - You know what? Aubrey is really cool. She's my best friend from college. You'd probably really like her. Why don't the three of us go? - Okay. Great. - Syrup? - Yeah. - Alright, well, the car looks like it's running fine. Not exactly sure why it wouldn't start. - Really? That's so weird. This is Miranda. She's the one that's renting the Vacay 'N Stay. - Hi. - Um, I'm a little greasy. - It washes off, right? - Yeah. (both laughing) - This is Tyler. He's Andrew's brother. He's been helping out a lot since the accident. - Actually I've been helping out longer than that. Unfortunately for Karen, she married a pencil pusher. - Well, I'm a pencil pusher and I know my way around a car. - Do you? Okay, then maybe you can help me out. What is... that right there? - If you're gonna try to trip me up, you gotta do better than that. That's an alternator. - Okay, and what is that back there? - That is an intake manifold. Ha! Ding, ding, game over! I win. - I'm impressed. - I grew up a tomboy. - Did you? - Okay, not to interrupt, but we gotta finish getting ready. We're having dinner with Aubrey. - Okay, the car looks like it's running fine, but if anything goes wrong, give me a shout. - Thanks, I will. - It was nice meeting you. - Yeah, you too. Hope to see you again. - Yeah. - He's got a really good build, too. You know who he reminds me of? That guy Reggie from senior year. Remember him? - Oh, yeah. - Anyway, I almost said no because I'm so sick of dating guys with kids. Remember what happened with that guy Mark with three kids? - Yep. What about you, Miranda? You seeing anyone? - No. I was for a few months, but it didn't work out. - Why not? - The problem with having kids isn't the kids, it's that they're still completely tied to their ex. That guy Mark was basically paying for child support, his ex's apartment and her car. - He paid for her car? Why? - Some crap about wanting a safe vehicle to haul the little brats around. - I can understand that, I guess. I don't know where the waitress is. I'm gonna go get more wine. You guys good? Anyone? - Uh, no. Thank you. So, um, you've known Karen since college? - She's my big sis. - Huh? - Sorority sisters. Delta Psi Beta? I take it you weren't in a sorority? Well, every pledge gets hooked up with a junior and becomes a big sister. - So it's like a forced friendship. - Hardly. It's a very strong bond. Karen and I are best friends. - I'm sure it's nothing compared to having an actual real sister. - What? - Please. You're comparing your relationship, like, with a blood relative. That's absolutely ridiculous. - You're obviously not familiar with the Greek system, huh? - I don't see how it matters. - That's why you don't understand. - Excuse me. I need to use the restroom. Stop it. You are nice, sweet, innocent Miranda. You need to let that bitch just be a bitch. Kill 'em with kindness, or some shit like that. - You think she meant to be intentionally rude? - Kinda. - I don't think she meant anything by it. Don't worry about it. - You are so right about this place. You cannot get cheesesteaks like this in Oregon. - Isn't it good? It's one of my favorite spots. - You have to promise me that we'll come here before I leave. - Absolutely. (sinister music) So you're staying for another week? - Yeah, if that's okay. They asked me to stay on an extra week to do some additional training. I mean, unless you have the room rented already... - No, no, it should be fine. - Okay! It'll be great. So maybe on your next day off we could go shopping or do something really fun. - Yeah, um, that might work. - I'm so excited! Yay! We're gonna have so much fun! - Okay. - Um, well then, I'll go make the payment. - Okay. (doorbell ringing) - Karen? - No. Miranda. - Hi! I'm Karen. You must be Evander? - The one and only. - You took the train in, right? How was it? - Absolutely wonderful. You really get to see the country when you travel by train. - I bet. I can show you to your room. It's upstairs. Thanks. (sinister music) (loud rock music) - I can only give you daytime right now. - Oh, that's fine. My nights, they're kind of... they're not free right now, so. - Perfect. You're hired. - You don't wanna see me dance? (chuckling) - Honey, I don't care if you get up there and do the Macarena, as long as you bring in customers. - Deal. - Dr. Mosler said I have to make you walk. - Yeah, I know. Hey, so it looks like I'm coming home to a full house on Tuesday, huh? - It's not too bad. Evander's hardly there. - And, uh, Miranda? - She's always there. - Oh boy, what does that mean? Thought you liked her. - I do. She's pleasant enough. She just always wants to spend time with me. I'm never alone. - Yeah, well, you know, she doesn't really know anybody else. - Yeah, she's been a good enough guest. I'm just pretty independent, you know? - Ha! Yeah, that you are. That you are. (chuckling) - Not everyone's good in stressful situations. I'm guessing you are, or you wouldn't be an EMT. (door opening) But it might be one of the things that balances you and Andrew out. Sounds like, in general, you two are fairly balanced. - Hey, guys. - Oh, hey, Miranda. - Am I interrupting something? - No, we were just chatting. You should try Evander's salsa. It's one of the best I ever had. - Picked up the recipe when I was driving through New Orleans in the eighties. - Hmm. Well, I'm not a big salsa fan, so... Anyway, look what I got us. Thought we could drink wine tonight and watch Bridges of Madison County. - How did you know that was my favorite movie? - I didn't. I just... I saw you DVR'd it, that's all. - Oh. Um, I think I'm gonna just head up and have a bath, read a book. I could use a little bit of alone time. - I understand. - Alright, you guys, I'm gonna go up. Good night. Thank you again for the talk. I mean that. - Good night. - Good night. - 'Night. - This reminds me of when we first met. We used to talk on the phone for hours. - [I know, right?] You know, one time, I uh... I left my buddy's house at halftime just so I could call you. - No, you didn't. - [Yeah, of course!] [Wanted to play everything just right.] (sinister music) - Alone time. - [Oh, I can't wait for you to come home on Tuesday.] [I miss falling asleep with you.] - Can I interest you in coming with me to Belson Gardens? - Sounds boring. - The photos are beautiful. Living laboratory, historical landmark, plants and trees all around. Top of the line arboretum. - I have to work, so have fun. Pff! "Screw you." (chuckling) Oh, I can't say that. Okay, um... "Thank you, "but the room is... taken." (door opening) - Oh, Miranda! What are you doing in here? Karen told us to stay out of the den. - Yeah, well, she said that I could use her computer because my laptop is broken. Everything okay? - I got halfway to the bus stop and realized I'd forgotten my telephoto lens. I'll just go up and get it. Doesn't look broken. - You know what? I changed my mind. Let's go to that garden thingy. - I thought you had to work. - I'll call in sick. - I'm not sure if it's really your thing. - No, come on! Who doesn't want to see trees and plants? Let's go. I've never been to an... arbo... Uh, what do you call it again? - Arboretum. - Arboretum, yes. Arboretum. I can never pronounce that word. - It's right up here. - Great. (birds chirping) - It's so peaceful when no one else is around. (sinister music) That's neat. Looks like holly, but it's not. - Great. (sinister music) That's what you get for being so annoying. Christ, you're a waste of oxygen. Maybe in your next life you learn to mind your own business, huh? Good chat. (sighing) Hey. Thought I heard you in here. How was work? - Did you talk to Evander today? - Not really. Tried to say goodbye to him before I left for work, but he didn't respond. He kinda seemed cranky. - Did he? About what? He left three days early and gave me a horrible review. - What? "Host is rude. Not worth the money. Don't stay here"? What an ass. - I don't understand. He was completely happy with his room this morning. - Hm. Did you try calling him? - Yeah, but there was no answer. - He was kinda weird, anyway. - Was he? - Mm-hmm. - Well, now I have a bad review and I don't even know what I did wrong. - You know what? Don't worry about the review. I will log on tonight and I will give you a glowing review. - Really? - Yeah. You look like you could use a glass of wine. - I could. - Okay. So what about your dad? Were you close to him? - I don't think anyone was close to my dad, not even my mom. - Really? - He was in the Marines, so he was deployed a lot, so when he was home things were really tense. I preferred it when he was gone. What about you? - Um... I was, uh... I was adopted. When I was five. And then before that I basically bounced around from foster home to foster home. - Hm. Did something happen with your parents? - Yeah, uh... They were both married to other people. And then, um... the adoption records were sealed until the laws changed. - And did you find them? - Uh, yeah. Neither one of them wanted to have anything to do with me. - I can't imagine that. Having a kid, knowing they're out there and not wanting to meet them... at least once, you know? - I mean, I understand, you know, I would've interrupted their lives. Anyways, it was really hard, but I think what was worse was just not knowing about my siblings. It was like all my friends had sisters they could share clothes with, or brothers that would play pranks on them, and growing up, I had... nobody. - Yeah, I always wanted a sister too. - Really? - I think that's why Aubrey and I got along so well, 'cause we both wanted it, so we kind of became each other's sister. - Yeah. Yeah, I like her. She's a cool chick. - She's a trip. (both laughing) She always has a crisis going on. It drives Andrew crazy. - Really? - Yeah. - This is good. This is really good. I'm so glad to be home. - I'm so glad to have you home. I'm gonna go make some food. (sighing) - Alright, steaks are close. - Can't wait. - Oh, Miranda, hey. - Hey, guys. Ooh! Smells good. What have you got cooking? - Nebraska grass-fed rib eyes. You hungry? - Starving. - Bought an extra. Want a beer? - Sure. - I got it. - So, you must really know your way around a kitchen. - Are you kidding me? I'm a master. Right, brother? Tell her. He knows. - Don't believe a word this guy says. (laughing) Well, I think that's gonna have to be it for me, guys. - No! It's not the company, is it? - Yup. (laughing) No, no, it's the, uh... It's the medication. - Whatever, bro. You're just getting old. (laughing) - Good night. - (both): Good night. - Thanks for dinner, bro. - Hey, no problem. - This was really good. - Yeah? You liked it? - I'd say you are a master. - Got my little tricks. - You win that title. - Um, well, how about a little dessert? - What's the matter? I thought you liked her. - I do. I don't know, she's just been here for a week and she's acting like she wants to marry him. - I don't think we have to worry about that. Why are you so stressed? - I guess that whole Evander thing still got into me. I still don't have the other room rented out. (grunting) - Yeah, well, you know, I don't know what the deal with that Evander guy is. You know what, screw him. Can't please everybody, right? You just gotta let it go. We'll get somebody to fill the room, don't worry. - I guess. - Hey, at least Miranda's paying for an extra week, that's good, right? - Yeah. - Yeah. (rock music, men yelling) - What are you so happy about today? - Ha! I met my future husband last night. His name is Tyler and he is hot as hell and he's super nice. - That's great! Hey, listen, my roommate's moving out at the end of the month. Just found out this morning. Wanna share a nice little apartment in Fishtown? - Um, I think I'm just gonna stay where I'm at. - At a Vacay 'N Stay? - I know it sounds weird, but Andrew and Karen are like family already, so... Thanks anyway! Mwah, mwah! (sighing) She's gonna love it. (cell phone ringing) Hello? - [Hey, Miranda, it's Tyler.] - Hey, how are you? - Good. Um, listen, I was just wondering if you wanted to maybe go out with me sometime, maybe for drinks or something? - Uh, sure. - [How about Thursday?] - Um, yeah, Thursday sounds good. - Cool, pick you up at nine? - Okay. Looking forward to it. - [Great, me too.] - Alright, bye. (gasping and laughing) (sighing) (cell phone ringing) - Oh. Hold on a sec. It's Aubrey. Hello? - Crying: [What are you doing right now?] - I'm just going to lunch. Are you okay? You sound upset. - Gary broke up with me. In a text. [I tried calling him, but he won't answer.] - Where are you? At work? - I walked out. - You walked out? Aubrey! - I wanna go to his house and demand he talk to me! - No, no, no, no. Don't do that. - Can you just come and pick me up? - Just a sec. Would you kill me if I bailed on lunch? I should go talk Aubrey off the ledge or she's gonna lose her job. Her boyfriend broke up with her. - Of course. - Thanks. - Someone send Aubrey to hell! - It's not that I don't like Miranda, it's just she's always so desperate for my attention. It's like she really needs a friend or something. - Maybe she doesn't have any friends. Did you look her up on Facebook? - Her profile's private. I can only see her main picture and her cover photo. - Hm. Oh, by the way, that watch you asked me to order in for Tyler, it isn't in yet. Probably this afternoon. I'll bring it over tomorrow and leave it with your hubby. - Right, I still owe you for that. Thanks for getting us your discount. Saved us a lot of money. - Miranda. Where are you off to? Running a little late for work? (gasping) Trainer at the Daxon my ass! (rock ballad) - Hey, I think that girl's taking pictures in here. - Oh, my God. Aubrey, what are you doing here? - It's a nice place. Not as nice as the Daxon, but it suits you. - You stupid bitch. Delete those photos right now. - No. - Gimme the phone! - No, Karen deserves to know what a liar you are. (grunting) - Miranda, stop! - No! Gimme the phone! You're not showing her anything! - What the hell is going on? - She assaulted me! - She's taking pictures! - Stop it! Stop it. Let it go. - Aubrey! Aubrey! - Let it go! - Come on! You don't understand! - Let it go. - [Hey, it's Karen.] [Leave me a message.] - Karen, it's Miranda. Can you call me as soon as you get this message? There's something that, um, I need to explain to you. (phone chiming) - What the hell? You attacked Aubrey? - I didn't attack Aubrey. I just wanted to delete the photos off her phone. - Why did you lie to me about your job? - I know. I was trying to explain it at lunch yesterday, but stupid ass Aubrey ruined it. - Whoa. She's my friend. Do not talk about her like that. - Yeah, well, she's a conniving bitch and she's out to get me. - Miranda! - I'm sorry. Listen, there is a lot of things that I need to explain to you, and I wanted to tell you earlier, but I was afraid it was going to affect our relationship. - Relationship? She's a host and you're a guest renting a room. That's pretty much how that goes. - No, we're a lot more than that. - No, we aren't. Miranda, you've been a great guest, but somewhere along the way this has gotten weird, and I don't know where, but it's gotten crazy. I think that you need to find somewhere else to stay. - No, wait. Okay, I'm sorry about what happened with Aubrey, but it is her. It wasn't me. She's jealous of me. She sees how close you and I are getting and she wants that. She's really scared of it. - Please stop. Andrew and I have way too much going on right now and we can't handle this. It's time for you to find somewhere else to stay. - Wait!! Read it. - What is this? - It's her birth certificate. - Look at the name of the mother. - Nancy Holliston? - That's my mother's name. - Yeah. I'm your sister, Karen. - That's not possible. - Our mother had an affair with my father when your father was deployed. And when your dad came back and found out that she was pregnant, it was too late to get an abortion. And so he told her that if she didn't get rid of me, he would take you and leave. So she did. That's according to my father. - I... Wow. Did you... meet her? - No. When the adoption records opened, I raced down there and I found out who she was. I looked her up and I wrote her a letter telling her who I was, and we were gonna meet when she got back from Mexico, but... obviously she passed away. - Uh, okay, so let me get this straight. You, um... You came here pretending to be a stranger to rent our room... - I didn't want to lie to you guys, I just... I didn't know what else to do. Okay, after everything that happened with our mother, and my father wanting... my father wanting nothing to do with me... Um... I just... I didn't know if I should tell you. Because I thought you were gonna reject me. - I... I can't do this. - No, Karen, I'm sorry. I don't wanna hurt you. - I'm sorry. I just need... I need some time. - Karen, wait. Wait! God. I should've told her the truth. I should've told her who I was. - Yeah, you should've. Look, just give her some space, okay? - I just wanted a chance. - I can't believe that I have a sister. - I know. [I mean, it kinda makes sense somehow, you know, why she was being so needy.] - [I just can't believe that Mom] didn't tell me about any of this. I can't wrap my head around it. What do I do now? What next? - Well, you should try not to make any decisions tonight. [Just sleep on it, you know.] - [True.] I wish Mom was here. I have so many questions for her. - I know, baby, I know. - Miranda, this is so beautiful. Thank you. - They match. You can put them together and they're like a heart and they match. I, uh... I'm so sorry I lied to you. Again, I just... I wanted to be truthful from the beginning, but... I was so afraid that you were just gonna tell me to get lost. And... you have no idea how bad I have wanted a sister, like, my whole life. And then when I found out that you existed, I just... I didn't want to screw it up, so I hope I haven't. Have I screwed it up? - I think this is just... really difficult for everyone. Um, I thought that you may wanna see some photos of our mother, since you never got a chance to meet her in person. - Can I ask you how... she died? - She committed suicide. - What? - She had been having stomach pains, so I took her to the doctor - this was in February- and they ran a bunch of tests and they found that she had stomach cancer. But her prognosis was good, she was in the early stages. They wanted to start chemo, but she decided to go to Mexico for a week before starting treatment, just to relax and prepare herself. And then, um... four days after she got there, I got a call from the police in Mexico that... that she had hanged herself in her room. - Oh, my God... - She had left a note for me on her tablet, but never sent it, and I didn't see it until... until I got there. - Oh, my God... Did she, um... did she mention me in the note? - No, not at all. She just said that she, um... that she didn't want to suffer through something that she didn't think she could survive. And she had a beautiful last couple of days and... it was where she was happy. - Yeah. (cell phone ringing) - Sorry, I don't know who this is. Hello? - [Hi, is this Karen Hexley?] - Yes, it is. - My name's Emily Swanson. I believe my grandfather Evander Swanson was staying at your house? - Yes, he was. - [Well, I saw the review he wrote on you on Vacay 'N Stay.] My grandfather's never written a bad review in his life. What happened? - I don't know. Everything seemed fine, and then when I got back from work he was gone. - [Well, he's missing.] [No one's talked to him since the day he posted that review.] He hasn't used his credit cards or answered his cell phone. - Oh, my God. It's Evander's granddaughter. They can't find him. - Oh, my God. - [I'm going to file a missing persons' report.] The police will probably contact you. - [Of course.] Anything I can do to help. Please, give them my number. - [Thank you] [so much.] - Thank you. Please, keep me informed. - That's so weird. Man, I hope he's okay. - Me too. - You're the only real family that I have, and... - I... I want to continue to get to know you, but I want to do it the right way... slowly. - Okay... - I think you need to find a place to live, and then you and I can, you know, build a relationship slowly and get to know each other as sisters, and have dinners and barbecues and... - So... don't stay with you. - It's just too much, too soon. I want to get to know you as a sister, not as a roommate. I'm not gonna make you leave tomorrow. I'll help you find a place near us. - So when are you kicking me out, hm? - I'm not kicking you out. I'm trying to figure out this situation. - When I leave, someone else is gonna rent the room. I mean, isn't it better to rent it to your own sister than just some stranger? - Staying with Andrew and I is not an option. Not yet. - I'm sorry. I know. You're right. I'm sorry. I need to respect the way that you want to do this, and I do. I respect it. So, um... You know what? I'm gonna find a place in Philly and we'll go to weekly lunches, and then... and then we... we'll see how it goes. - Thank you. - You're my sister, and I love you and I just... I really want you to be happy. - Look, it has brand new paint and a brand new stove. - Wow, yeah, this is great. I'll take it. - Excellent. So I need you to fill this out and give it back to me. I'll need three months' pay stubs, last year's tax returns, a $1,000 deposit, and $25 for the credit and background check. - Okay. (police siren) Hi, Officer! How are you? - License and registration. - Right. Um, I'm from out of town, so I was probably driving around, not paying attention to the speed limit 'cause I was a little lost, so... sorry. - Registration. - Right. Uh, it's a rental car, so I have my rental agreement right there. (birds chirping) - Can you please step out of the vehicle? - What? I didn't do anything. - The rental car you're driving was reported stolen by the company. - Oh no, Officer, I was gonna return this. I was gonna return this car last week. I told them. This must be a mistake on their part. - I'll let you take that up with the company. - No! This car is not stolen! This is so ridiculous! Hey! (cell phone ringing) - Hello? - [Hey, it's Miranda.] [I'm in jail.] - Jail?! What? - Karen? - Hey! Nick! - What are you doing here? - I'm bailing out my sister. Um, what about you? Did you make detective? - Mm-hmm. - Congratulations! - Thanks. I gotta go. We should do lunch soon. Good to see you. - You, too. - Her personal items we collected from the car. - Thanks. What? What's this? You used my name to rent an apartment? - What? - Where did you get that? Did you go through my purse? - No! They retrieved it from the stolen car before they sent it to the impound! - I can't believe this. - No, it's not what you think. I was using you as a reference. I'm sure I just put your information down in the wrong spot. - And where's your information, Miranda? Because I don't see your name anywhere on this application. - I'm telling you, it's a simple mistake, Karen. I'm doing everything that you wanted. I'm finding a place to live. - I can't do this anymore. You lied, you stole my identity, and now I'm done. It's time for you to go. - No, Karen, no, you don't know what you're saying. Okay? I'm getting an apartment. We're gonna do things the way that you wanted. We're gonna... - No, no. Pleaseno! - You're all that I have! You're all that I have! We're one! - She asked you to leave, Miranda. Now I need you to go. You have to go. - Dammit, Andrew! - She told you to leave. - No! No, Karen! (grunting) (phone ringing) - Hey. - Tyler, hey, it's Miranda. I was just wondering, are we still on for later? - Yeah, totally. - [Great.] Um, I'm still at work, so can I just meet you over there? - [Yeah, sure. I'll text you the address in a bit.] - Perfect. Great, I'll see you in a bit. - [Okay, cool. See you soon.] (muted music) - Hey. - Hi. - Sorry I'm late. Traffic was... it was just awful. - Oh, no problem. I did get ahead of you, though. - Don't worry about it, I'll catch up. Can I get you another one? - Uh, sure. Cosmo. - Alright, coming right up. I'll grab a Cosmo and an Old Fashioned. (doorbell ringing) - Hi, are you Karen Hexley? - Yes. - I'm Detective Hannah Voda, Homicide. I'd like to talk to you about Evander Swanson. - Homicide? - Groundskeeper found his body today in Belson Gardens. - Oh, my God... nk we're going out on a second date, you're crazy." - No! - No, seriously. - No, you didn't say that. - Yeah, and then I stuck her with the bill. (laughing) - Oh, my God. I like a guy with a sense of humor. - So, um, did you tell Karen and Andrew that we were going out tonight? - No. No, I don't really like to share my personal stuff. I'm mean, they're great, you know. Getting to know Andrew was great, and Karen, I mean, we just clicked when we met. - Karen's the best. - Yeah. And I'm sure they're enjoying their privacy. - Last call! - ...until we get kicked out of this bar, which I think might be soon. - I didn't know this bar closes so early. Um... We could hit up another bar if you want, or... I don't know, go back to my place for a drink? - Yeah. Okay. I mean, for Karen and Andrew, of course. - Oh yeah, totally. - So, your sister Miranda was the last one to see him. - Uh, half-sister. - Yes. - And where is she? - We had an argument and I asked her to leave. - And you've got no idea where she might have gone? - Maybe the... strip club? - She worked at a strip club, but she got fired. Maybe someone there would know. - What's the name? - Red or white? - Uh... red. - I'll just give these a quick rinse. And... I've got a beautiful Barolo. Be back in one sec, okay? - Okay. (cell phone buzzing) (footsteps approaching) - This is from a region in Italy called Piedmont. - I am so, so sorry. I accidentally just knocked your phone into the sink. - Oh. - Um... but I wouldn't turn it on, you'll ruin it. Do you have, like, a bag of rice? - Miranda Breyers. - Oh, Miranda. That girl's a mess. Missed her first day of work, gets fired in her first week... - Was she close with anyone? - Yeah, JoJo. She's, uh... right over there. - So just, like, leave it just like that. Oh, I'm sorry, I feel so bad. - Hey, let's not let it ruin our night, okay? - Okay. - Alright, let's get on that wine. Seriously, you don't have a boyfriend? I would've thought a girl like you would have them lined up for her back home already. - I did have a boyfriend, but it didn't work out. - No? - Mm-mm. You? - My last serious relationship was about two years ago. Turned into a total nightmare. - Yeah. I know what you mean. - We'd only recently reconnected. I didn't know when I got her the job here that she was so... unstable. - Did she ever mention Evander Swanson, the other guest staying with Karen and Andrew? - Not to me. - Do you have any idea where she might be right now? - She mentioned meeting a guy, but I don't remember his name. - Hm. Would you mind giving her a call, let her know that we just want her to come down to the station? We just want to speak with her. - I doubt she'll pick up, but I'll try. (phone buzzing) (sighing) - [Best Choice Adoption Agency, how can I help you?] - Hi, I'd like to speak to someone about an adoption that happened 28 years ago. (humming) - [You've reached Tyler. Leave a message.] - Hey, buddy. Can you call me as soon as you get this? Just some crazy stuff going on with Miranda I gotta tell you about. - So you mean there's no birth father ever recorded anywhere? - [No, we have no record of him at all.] - Okay, thanks. - [You're welcome.] - Miranda lied. - Again? What was it this time? - She said that she found her birth father and he rejected her, but the adoption agency couldn't have told her that because they didn't know about it. - You mean your mom never put a father on the birth certificate? - No. And the only way for her to know who he was is from Mom. She said she didn't get a chance to talk to her before she died. Unless she lied about that, too. - When did they open these records? - June 1st. Three weeks before Mom died. - Who are you calling? (phone ringing) - Detective Shelby here. - Hi, Nick. This is Karen Hexley calling. How are you? - Hey, couldn't be better. What's up? - [I was wondering] if you could help me with something. - [Sure.] - Do you have any contacts in the police department in Riviera Maya, Mexico? And if not, can you make a phone call for me? - Good morning. (laughing) - Hey. - I made breakfast. - Oh, did you? - Do you want it in bed? - Yeah. I don't think anyone's ever really done that for me before. - Well then, you... have been dating the wrong kind of girls. - Maybe I have. - Mm-mm-mm. I'll go get it. - I didn't get anything from the police down there, but I did call the hotel where your mom was staying. - Is that Miranda? - Well, the manager told me six other Americans were staying there at the same time your mom was. She wouldn't give me their names for privacy reasons, but she did give me the area codes of the phone numbers they used at the time of reservation. One of them was from Oregon, so I asked her for a clip of that person checking in. - Oh, my God... know, I really wish you didn't have to go back to Oregon so soon. I could get used to this. - I don't have to go back. No, it was... kind of my plan the whole time to stay. - Really? - I was gonna let Karen announce this, but uh... I guess I should tell you. - Tell me what? - Karen is my half-sister. We have the same mom. I mean, the whole reason that I came out here was to get to know her better. - What? - Well, I mean... it was Karen's news to tell, I just... I thought that maybe because you and I were getting... so close, I thought I should... - How long have you known this? - I... I just... I just told them yesterday. And I get that that was probably a mistake, but if I just walked up to Karen's door and told her who I was, she would most likely reject me, because our mom didn't even tell her who I was, you know, and she needs time, she just needs time to just come to terms with it, you know? Because everything was fine before I told her who I was. We were getting along so great. - Miranda, you know, you really should've told me before last night. - How was I supposed to tell you? Was I supposed to just bring it up? How do you... how do you want me to say something like that? Tyler, I like you, I like you a lot, and I know that you like me. I know that you like me, and we're gonna be one great family. I'm so happy to have all of you in my life. (phone ringing) - Hello? - Tyler! Hey man, why didn't you call me back? [I left messages on your cell.] - Uh, my phone's kind of out of commission right now, bro. - Okay, look, [I've gotta tell you what's going on with Miranda.] - Yeah, I know, she's Karen's sister. - How did you know that? - Because she's here right now, alright? She stayed over [last night.] - Okay. [Go somewhere where she can't hear you. There's more] [to this story.] - Go ahead. - [The cops are looking for her, man.] [They think she had something to do with that guy Evander's death.] - Evander? Who's that? - [The guy that was staying with us] and went missing. You gotta keep her there, okay? I'm sending the cops over right now. - The cops? Wait, slow down! - She's bad news, pal. - They're all against me. - They found Evander's body at the arboretum. [Listen, just keep her there, alright?] - I don't believe this. Okay, I'll try. - [Okay.] Tyler! [Tyler, are you okay?] - If you look at the medical examiner's drawings, the markings don't seem consistent with hanging, do they? - More like manual strangulation. (cell phone ringing) - It's my husband. Hello? - Karen! Miranda attacked Tyler! The police and ambulance are on the way to his place now! - Miranda just attacked my brother-in-law. - [Dispatch.] - Hey, it's Detective Shelby. We got a lead on Miranda Breyers. Hold on. - Ugh! Ugh! - Do you see this? There were no fingerprints found on the victim's tablet. At all. - What does that mean? Someone wiped them? - It's something we see when people try to fake a suicide note. - What are you saying? Are you saying my mom didn't commit suicide? Do you think that Miranda killed my mother? Oh, my God! - The ambulance just arrived and they said that Tyler was coherent. - Oh, thank God! Do you think she'll go back to the house? Andrew's there alone. - I'll get a car over there now. (sinister music) (knocking) - Hold on, I'm coming. - Hey, Andrew? - Yes. - Everything okay in here? - Yes, Officer. - Your wife is on her way back now. I'm gonna be parked outside through the day, through the night, just in case Miranda tries to come back here. - Excellent, thank you. You sure you don't need to come inside? - I'll be in the car. - Okay, thank you. (sinister music) (blood gushing) Miranda! - Shh. - Andrew? Andrew! (gasping) - Too late. - Oh my God, Andrew! - It's not about him, it's about you! We're blood! You should've stuck up for your sister. - You're crazy. (screaming) - I wanted you to be different, but you ended up just like Mom! - You killed her! (screaming) - No, no, no, no. No, you need to hear this, Karen. You need to hear what kind of person Mommy was. Hm? - You killed her! - No, she made me! She made me kill her! Because I wrote her a letter when I finally found her, and I told her that I forgave her for giving me up, even though I had a horrible life because of it. And I told her that I just wanted to meet her. That's all I wanted, Karen. I just wanted to meet her. And she called me. She called me and she said that she had cancer and that she was going down to Mexico, but that she would see me when she got back. And I said okay, I said okay... then I couldn't. I couldn't, because I had waited 27 years. 27 years. So I decided to go down to Mexico, and I was gonna surprise her. I'm looking for a guest. And I walked all around until I found her. And I followed her to her hotel room, and when I told her who I was... I thought that she would be happy to see me, you know, I mean, the effort that I went through to find her... but she wasn't! She was mad that I came to see her when she'd told me not to. And you know what, Karen? She wouldn't answer any of my questions! I asked her who my father was, if I had siblings, things that I have a right to know, and she wouldn't answer my questions! I waited my whole life... I waited my whole life for those answers! She wouldn't tell me! - Why? - Because... because she wanted to wait and tell you first. She chose you over me! - Hello... hello... - I was so angry, Karen, I was so mad, I was so angry, you know, it just happened. (choking) That photo was the only thing I had to go on. It took me months to find you. But then Andrew's accident... and your picture... and there it was. I finally found you. It was like the universe had sacrificed Andrew so I could find you. And then I saw you on Vacay 'N Stay, and that was my perfect way in. - How could you kill her? She was our mother! - Your mother! Your mother! She's not my mother, she never wanted to be my mother! - [Unit 347, you are watching 2214 Magnolia Boulevard?] - Unit 347, affirmative. - [We just received a 911 call from inside that location.] - See, I don't blame you for our mother's choices, Karen, but you did the same thing. You did the same thing! You shut me out! You don't do that to family! You don't do that to family! Now you're gonna know what it's like to lose everything you care about. - No! - Who? Who should I kill first? You should've just embraced me, Karen. It'd have been a lot easier. - No! - Freeze! Drop the knife! I said drop the knife! Drop the knife! (gunshots) - Andrew! - This is Officer Friedman. I've got a 1042 at 2214 Magnolia Boulevard. I need backup and medical assistance. Suspect is down. (birds chirping) - Well, I wouldn't call it a promotion, I mean, it's a desk job, you know? - It's still more money, right? - Yeah. Yeah, I'm making more now than I have ever before. - Okay, well, in my world that's a promotion. (doorbell ringing) Now, speaking of which, is it possible to borrow a little cash? I helped you move! - Of course. - Hi! Hi. You're the first one here. - Well, that never happens. - Well, except for Tyler, of course, who's here all the time. (laughing) (phone chiming) - How's work? - Good. I hear you guys are going to Florida. - Hey guys, so I was thinking about this vacation we were talking about... Closed Captioning by SETTE inc.
