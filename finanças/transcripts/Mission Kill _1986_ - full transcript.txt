(train whistling) (train rattling) (train whistling) (gun firing) (glass shattering) (announcer speaking in foreign language) (speaking foreign language) (upbeat music) (ship horn blowing) - Don't do it. (ship horn blowing) - Gastel, it's me, Clyde. - [Gastel] The address is 7 Rosario Street, Apartment C. He's armed and he's dangerous. Any questions? - Yes, there are. What about the money? - [Gastel] Come over to the casino. Good luck. - You'll wait for me at the beach hut. - It won't work, Clyde. - We need that money. And there's no other way of getting it. I'll see you at the beach hut. - I may not be there. (suspenseful music) (gun firing) (man grunting) - Albert. - I didn't think they'd send you. - Why do they want you killed? - McLean had a big competitor. And now that he's out of the way I guess I've become a nuisance. I know too much. Christ, we live in a cesspool. - I know. But maybe that's all we deserve. - Damn it, Clyde. I've never ratted on anyone. Tell them, tell them. That even if the cops catch up to me, I won't talk. - It wouldn't help, Albert. In McLean's book, you're a dead man. - You've never accepted this kind of a job before. - I needed the money. - I got money. We could escape together. - We're not going in the same direction. (gun firing) (dramatic jazz music) - [Gastel] Did everything go all right, Clyde? - [Clyde] Yes, thank you. - Good. McLean will be pleased. How do you feel? - No different. - Throw them over to me. Seven on your first throw. You got a lucky hand. Did you come for your money? - Yes. - There it is on the table. What am I going to do with you, Clyde? - Why didn't you tell me it was Albert? He was my friend. - You're my friend, too. But you didn't do the job and you still come looking for the money. Tell me, Clyde, what am I going to do with you? - I'm sure you have an idea. - [Gastel] Why did you do it, because of the girl? - I'm tired of palm trees. - Clyde, remember, this is an island and no one can leave it, unless McLean says it's okay. And in your case, I'm afraid he's not going to say it's okay. (guns firing) (guns firing) (man grunting) (slow music) - Don't make me kill a friend, Peter. - You haven't a chance. Sooner or later, we'll catch up with you. - Get those dice moving. With both hands. (dice rattling) I want to hear them loud and clear. (mid-tempo music) - Hello. You got news on Clyde? - We're looking for him. Joe saw him two hours ago at the gas station. - Ah, McLean is not pleased with you. - We're sure to get him today. - I don't want him killed. - I don't care what you want. Clyde is my business. - Funny appetite they have in Cuba. See that Clyde is surrounded. Afterwards, I'll take care of it. (dramatic music) Yeah, yeah, 'cause Clyde is my business now. No, McLean is not pleased with you. (gun firing) (man groaning) (gun firing) Not at all. (gun firing) (man grunting) (man laughing) (car horn honking) (gentle music) - [Woman] We've always been happy here. - We've never been happy. Just that here it seemed more bearable. - I want to stay here forever. - We'll go to see Tom Sayon tomorrow. - Why? - To get the passports and the boat. Nothing has changed. (slow music) We're leaving. - What about the money? - I have it. - [Woman] And then? - I didn't kill Albert, but I got the money anyway. We're get out of here, Anne. We'll leave this stinking island, I swear to you. - You know we won't. They're already hunting you down. And the minute you show your face, they're going to get you. And then you're going to disappear just like all the others. And I, I either have to go back to Richard or disappear too. - Anne, we must try. We'll go see Tom Sayon tomorrow. - Tomorrow. Tomorrow. Tomorrow. (upbeat music) (suspenseful music) - Tom? You know where Tom is? Who did that to you? - McLean's men. - Do you have the passports? - Take your money, brother. I have a wife and children. I don't want problems. - And the boat. - They smashed the motor. First my face and then the motor. - Go away, sir, go away. Why do you want to harm us? We only want to live in peace. - Take your money, brother, and forget me. - Keep it, get another motor. - [Anne] Clyde, the car. (man whistling) Clyde. Clyde. (groaning) Clyde, let me, Clyde! (man groaning) (man groaning) Clyde! (Clyde groaning) (man whistling) (Anne groaning) Clyde. (slow music) (car engine roaring) (children laughing) - [Child] Hey, wait for me. (children laughing) - It's open. Come right in, brother. Hey, Clyde Hart. What in the hell happened to you? - The bed, the bed. - [Dark Haired Woman] I thought it was a client, and you show up like this. - Disinfectant and bandages. - In this house there's only rum. Trouble with the police? - No. - If you're in trouble with a gang it's even worse. - Just get some water. Just water, water. Oh, oh. (upbeat music) (singing in foreign language) (car horn honking) - It's been a long time, hasn't it? - Three years. - Those were happy days. Now my door is open to anyone. (dramatic music) Clyde, Clyde, listen. Do you hear me? They're coming. - Where's Anne? - I do not think she'll come back. Let me help you. Try to get away over the roof. - I'm tired. I'm tired from running. Six years I've been running from something. I don't even know from what. Get away, they mustn't find you here. Take it. You'll need it more than I do. - If I were your woman, I would not have left you. - You and I, we've never been smart. Now split, go away. (slow suspenseful music) - [Man] Clyde Hart? - Go ahead, shoot. - [Man] Police, you're under arrest. (Clyde laughing) (Anne yelping) - You saved his skin, but he'll be an old man by the time he gets out of prison. - You'll never be able to make me forget him. - Don't make any other mistakes, because you're alone now. - Yes, I am. - Albert Webster. - Mm. - And Peter Gastel. - Gastel? - Two Americans in 24 hours. Are you trying to break a record, Inspector Reed? - They're McLean's men. I had warned Albert Webster back in Panama that he would probably end up this way. But I'm surprised at the other one. Peter Gastel was the head of a group. - It's good to have you back in your old job again. - Thank you. I've always had a soft spot in my heart for the islands. - Please sign the receipt. I'll tell them to dress your friends and you can take them away. This hotel is full up. (laughs) - I'd also like the take along the other American, a certain Clyde Hart. - I'm sorry, but we are still questioning him. - I could show up here tomorrow morning with a release from the embassy forcing you to hand him over to me. - [Man In White Shirt] What do you want him for? - He might be useful to me. You won't get anything out of him. - There you are, Clyde Hart. He's all yours. Those two stiffs of yours as a bonus. Oh Fred, be careful. Don't take any chances when you're so close to the finish line. (hand slapping) - [Man] Where are the trucks coming from? Talk! - [Man] How many times have you seen McLean? - [Man] Now where did you hide the guns? - [Man] Hart, speak up. (speaking foreign language) - Clyde Hart, formerly Klaus Hertz. Born in Frankfurt, Germany, May 29th, 1943. Emigrated with his parents to the United States in 1951. Preliminary schooling then two years at the University of Southern California. Drafted in '69, a year and a half in Vietnam, and then deserts. Next turns up in Jamaica as a member of the McLean organization. Recently you accepted your first kill. You really needed the money, didn't you? - What do you want? - They used the wrong methods questioning you. No finesse. Shall we go for a drive? (upbeat music) As you can see for yourself, all means of escape are under surveillance. It would be practically impossible for you to leave the island. Ah, here's some old friends of yours. Yes. Do you remember them, Clyde? What do you suppose would happen if I made you get out? Tomorrow I would receive a call from the Santo Domingo Police Department asking me what to do with your corpse. - Don't lose your time. Your methods lack finesse too. (slow music) Why did you bring me here? - That was Peter Gastel's house. Now Richard Francis is in there, not alone. Would you like to guess what's going on behind that window? Anne Holden, born in Cincinnati 28 years ago. In 1966 she turns up in New York and strikes up a friendship with Nico San Angelo, a member of the McLean organization. Finally Clyde Hart appears on the scene. But stealing a sidekick's girl is against the rules, so Richard has been waiting for his chance. Anne Holden moved into that house three days ago after calling the police and asking them to save you. She hasn't been out since, except in the evening to go to a local movie house under guard. - What do you want? - I can get you two plane tickets and two passports, and mine are better than Tom Sayon's. - What's your price? - I want you to kill a man. I imagine you've been asked to do that before. - Yes, but not by the police. - Santo Domingo, okay? - Yes, sir. - McLean speaking. Any news? - [Man] You'll meet with Inspector Reed as planned. - Everything set? - [Man] Yes, sir, all set. - That's great. - [Man] Hi. - How are ya? - Fine, thanks. - Everything all right? - Everything's perfect. - How's the wife, she all right? - She's fine, thank you, sir. (helicopter drowns out speech) - Hi. - Good day, Mr. McLean. - Thank you. - Fine. (dramatic music) - Inspector Reed, Mr. McLean wants to talk to you. - The hell with him. All right, I'll talk to him. - You're wanted on the telephone, sir. - Ah, thank you. Here. Yes. - [Man] Mr. McLean, I have Inspector Reed here. - Edward, all of this kidnapping wasn't really necessary now, was it? - I just wanted to have a chat with you. You know, that's not a nice word, kidnapping. - Drop by for tea anytime. - You're a hard man to reach, an old fox without a lair. - It's kept me alive. - Then I guess you see I can lay hands on you whenever I want, right? You know, it's been a bit of a headache having you transferred out of the Caribbean. And here you are back again. Didn't you like New York? - I have some unfinished business here. - Fred, you're a pro. You've gotta know that these are shark-infested waters. They're dangerous. - I know that. - You're a stubborn son of a bitch, too. You've been annoying me on and off for 15 years. This has gotta be a personal grudge by now. It's not professional. I'm clean. - I'll admit I haven't been able to nab you until now, but I'd like one more crack at you before I retire. No one is invulnerable, McLean, no one. And one of these days even your dear friends in Washington will get sick of protecting you. - (laughs) You don't know your way around Washington. As far as that goes, your record there is a lot smellier than mine. - All filing systems lie. That's why I despise them. As I despise your friends in Washington and as I despise you. - You're a strange man, Fred. You refuse bribes, you don't take orders from your superiors that tell you to lay off me. Why is that? - You know very well why. - You only have a few months to go to retire. I won't say it again. Get off my back. - Commissario Clement? - He down there with the flowers. - Commissario Clement. - Ah, what good wind brings you here, Inspector? - Ah, narcissus. - Uh-huh, narcissus albus. - Preparing a nest for when you retire? - You should be doing the same thing. You only have a few more months. - Do you remember those three men of yours that I talked to you about? - Yes. - I'm going to need them now. - Hm. Well they aren't my best men. As a matter of fact, they're really a little shady. (laughs) Have you already spoken with them? - May I invoke the Fifth Amendment? - (laughs) What have you done with Clyde Hart? I know that you haven't turned him over to the US authorities. - I have other plans for him, Commissario. - Same plans as you have for my three men? - Let us suppose so. - And suppose I refuse? - You can't. I have a (mumbles) from your boss. - Where did you get this signature? - I have some power here too. If your men agree, they'll be under my orders for the next three weeks. - You are a lonely old fart, just as I am. And I like and respect you, so don't do anything too rash, because then I would have to, mm. - Don't worry, my friend. Go back to your narcissus, albus? - Albus. (mid-tempo jazz music) - [Man] Good morning. - Ah, good morning, sir. - Bring him in. - [Man] Good morning. - Hugo, you're there. And you're here. - Good morning, Clyde. Have a good night? - No. - Too bad. Well, let's get on with our project. I want you to meet some friends. - Oh yeah, whose friends? - First names will be sufficient. Juan, Daniel, Hugo. - Which one of you will prepare my breakfast every morning? - He will. I'll just wipe your ass. (Hugo laughing) - Hm, you would like that, wouldn't you? I prefer to work alone. - I'm sorry, you can't. They're under orders to kill you if they suspect things aren't going right. - Cops, aren't they? - First you'll have to train them. I want them to become real killers. - If they've accepted this job, they already are. - How much are we going to have to take from this guy, sir? - For now, a lot. After, well after you're on your own. If he can't handle the three of you, he's no good to me. - Hey, hungry? (Daniel grunting) (dramatic music) - You heard what the inspector said. I could kill ya if I wanted to. Get going. (Hugo groaning) (men grunting) (Daniel groaning) (gun firing) (hand slapping) - Blanks hurt too, don't they? The inspector just wanted to test you. - Fuck the inspector. - The gear you asked for is here. Come on, we're waiting for you. - Any of you guys ever handled plastic explosives? (waves crashing) Connect it. - Right. - Time it for 10 seconds. (timer clicking) One, two, three, four. (Hugo groaning) Five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, let's do it. The fuses weren't placed right. Now again. This time 20 seconds. (timer clicking) (bomb exploding) We must figure on having to remain underwater for one minute and a half. How long can you hold without breathing? - 2.10 minutes. - [Clyde] And you? - I don't know. - [Clyde] Well, what about you? - I never timed it. - Okay, call about the tower. I'll need it tomorrow. All right, you guys, we'll start with one minute. At my signal, you put your heads underwater. One, two, three, now. (men gasping) (water splashing) (men coughing) - You son of a bitch. I'll kill ya. (men coughing) - You didn't even last one minute. - The McLean factory. Down below is the first control, the station and the buildings of the factory. Here is the second control. We shall see it later in more detail. Here is Isabella Bay and the quay, which is the truck's destination through these palm trees. Okay, now in more detail, the second control. And the avenue of palm trees along which the truck must go to get to the quay. All this is part of the McLean empire, heavily guarded. The road going along, the exact spot on the quay where the truck has to top. Here is the dock. This is the end of the palm trees avenue and here is the administration building. McLean is in there. A commando will enter through here, the other through the yard. They will get off the truck and from the beach will attack the building. 150 miles between Santo Domingo and Isabella Bay, which we just saw. Clyde will tell you more about all that. - Well, the road is very bad and there's very little traffic on it. You can drive 60 miles an hour. - How many men will be on the truck? - Two, but we need them alive. - Right. - How are we're going to stop it? - Okay, your turn. (Daniel grunting) (Daniel groaning) (laughs) Try it again. (guns firing) (mid-tempo music) (guns firing) (guns firing) - Hi. (guns firing) - Nothing disturbs your appetite, not even the sight of that bastard. - No, why? - I'm fed up with seeing him all day. Does he have to eat with us too? - Ask him. - Why did you accept this job? For money or for promotion? - None of your business. - You'll still always smell like cops. - Don't forget, you'll be doing the dirty work. - I guess in the end we'll all stink. - (laughs) If we come out of this alive, you'll hear from me. - You're the one with the least probability of coming out alive. - Me, why? - Because you're a coward. - Sit down. (phone ringing) - Yes. Hello? Yes? Who's there? Who is it? - You're hurting me. - Huh. (slow dramatic music) - You're hurting me, my love, oh you're hurting me. Let me go, my love. Oh, oh, my love, let me (groans). (gun firing) - Let him go. (dramatic music) (speaking foreign language) (man grunting) (slow romantic music) - It's funny, all I do is think about you. And now I'm not even happy to see you. - Why? - Why should I be? What's left for you and me? - [Clyde] You drink too much. - I need it. I need it before Richard and I need it after Richard. - Why did you go back to him? - I don't have any choice. Either he kills me or I go to bed with him. So I go to bed with him. - I'd rather you slept with 100 other men. - 100 men or Richard, what the hell's the difference? Before I met you I didn't care. I knew they were all the same, they were all bastards. Now you made me love you, but I can't love you. So what the hell do I have to be happy about? It would be so much simpler if I'd never met you. - Let's leave here. Tonight. We can cross over the border to Haiti. - [Anne] (laughs) We don't have any passports. - This time we still have a chance. - [Anne] We have no chance, now or ever. - Believe me, please. - No chance, nothing. - Please, believe me. - Zero. Go away, just go away. I don't want to go to bed with you wondering which night it's going to be, which night you're going to end up full of bullets. Go, don't-- - Anne. - Away from my body, away from my lips. Go away. I never want to see you again, never. - [Clyde] Anne, please. - So don't come back looking for me because I just can't. I haven't got the guts. I don't want to be there when they kill you! - Good evening, Mr. Hart. Congratulations on your planned escape. (slow romantic music) - You and your chances. Now do you see, Clyde, now do you understand? - Take the lady home. - Yes, sir. - You know where Mr. Francis lives, don't you? - So, all of this was set up? You allowed me to get away from you. - I wanted you to see the girl. I thought she would be the right incentive for you. Now go back to the farm. You can go alone. - Where are we going? - To your lover's place. - I just said goodbye to a walking corpse. Did you ever say goodbye to a walking corpse? I know. All of a sudden I'm irresistible. Isn't that right? - Yeah. - I have such luck with men. You know what I want tonight? I want 100 men. Not one more and not one less. 100 exactly. Did you ever see a walking corpse? - I'm one. - You certainly are. (laughs) With that dirty look in your eye. (laughs) You had that dirty look the first two minutes you met me. Irresistible, irresistible. (laughs) - Hey, what are you doing? (tires squealing) - I've never been to bed with a cop. (Juan laughing) (gasps) Oh, I hope you don't mind, I'm drunk. (Juan laughing) I didn't think you would. - Wait a minute and I'll park. (upbeat music) (Anne laughing) - Some champagne? Champagne for us. (laughs) - Oh! (Anne laughing) (Anne groaning) (Clyde grunting) - Okay, pig, now let's see if you can stand it. Let's see if you can stand it for five minutes. Let's see how you like it. - Daniel! Daniel, are you crazy? Get out of here. - You were right. We're all going to stink pretty soon. You're doing a fine job. (mid-tempo music) - Yes, Mr. McLean, yes sir. Mr. McLean? Yes, I hear you perfectly. Washington has given you the green light. That's great. Don't worry. Don't you worry. I'll find Inspector Reed and I'll give him your message. I waited for you. - Did you? I decided to spend the night out. - Have you and Clyde made up for lost time? - I wasn't with Clyde. I went to a motel. - Alone? - No. - With who? - I don't know his name. He's a cop. - A cop? With you, baby, I've had it up to here. When I'm in bed with a woman I like it to be just the two of us. With you we've always been three. You, me, and Clyde. - You're wrong. There have only been two of us in that bed, me and Clyde. - If it were any other guy I'd give you a kick in the ass and tell you to go with him, and good riddance. But Clyde, no. And do you want to know why, huh? Because I'm going to kill him, and right before your eyes. - Our men will be in Isabella Bay tomorrow. Everybody knows exactly what he has to do. In return for which you will receive, you, two passports. For you, $10,000. You, clean record. And for you and me, nothing. - I accepted this job because I thought it was the right thing to do, and now-- - Any doubts? - Yes. - It's too late for doubts! You are under orders to kill Clyde at the first sign of treason. If you kill him for any other motive I'm afraid you'll be very sorry. - It'll be up to him, sir. - [Inspector Reed] Right. I'll stay here and wait for your phone call. Go on. - Let's go. - And you. Good luck, Clyde. - Hm, it's funny. Whenever they give me a dirty job to do they wish me good luck. (suspenseful music) (helicopter whirring) - Perfect day. - Right you are, sir. (slow music) - This is the place. We'll wait for you on the other side of the bridge. - Why should I be the one that's gotta jump? Why couldn't you do it? Or that bastard? - You must do it. You're under orders to do it. - I won't do it. I don't wanna. No, I won't do it, I tell ya. I won't do it! No, no! - You coward. Get out, I'll do it. Drive the car. (mid-tempo music) (helicopter whirring) (suspenseful music) - Hi. - [Man] Good morning, sir. - All set? - Yes, sir. (dramatic music) - Easy. - Don't try anything. - Go on. - Start. (suspenseful music) Just keep cool. Do what you were told, you hear? - Glad to see you. Everything all right? All right. (slow music) - Run for your lives, it's gonna blow. Watch out! (truck exploding) (siren wailing) (fire roaring) (guns firing) - Daniel! (helicopter exploding) (gun firing) (man groaning) - I did my job well, didn't I? - First class. (guns firing) - Hugo. (gun firing) (bomb exploding) (guns firing) (guns firing) (footsteps thudding) - You won't find a hole in the ground to hide in. - I've never had one. - So you've come to arrest me? - We've come to kill you. - Hm. Inspector Reed? - Shoot. - Shoot. I would if I were you. After all, we're among friends. (gun firing) (gun firing) - You haven't done your job. (gun firing) (gun firing) - You've made killers of us all. You should be satisfied now. (slow music) (phone ringing) - Inspector Reed, it's all over. McLean is dead. - Clyde, this is Richard. If you've managed to kill McLean, let me tell you that Inspector Reed is in trouble too. When you hear a shot, he'll be dead. (gun firing) - Where is Anne? - I've been using her for these past few days. Now she doesn't amuse me anymore. You'll find her at Palm Grove Beach in a couple of hours. (car engine roaring) (guns firing) (gun firing) (man grunting) (guns firing) (gun firing) (gun firing) - Next time I'll kill her. - Richard. Ah! (gun firing) (slow romantic music) (mid-tempo music)
