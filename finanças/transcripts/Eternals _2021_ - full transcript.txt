In the beginning.... ...before the six singularities and the dawn of creation, came the CELESTIALS. Arishem, the Prime Celestial, created the first sun and brought light into the universe. Life began, and thrived. All was in balance Until an unnatural species of predator emerged from deep space to feed on intelligent life - They were known as DEVIANTS. The universe was plunged into chaos To restore the natural order, Arishem sent ETERNALS Immortal heroes from the planet Olympia - to eliminate the Deviants Eternals had unyielding faith in Arishem until one mission led by the Prime Eternal, Ajak, changed everything... It is time It's beautiful, isn't it? I am Ikaris I am Sersi Good hit Also yours Thank you Ajak In this small earth of ours amid the measureless grossness and despair closed and safe within its central heart nestles the seed of perfection For its hope and optimism in humanity Echoes our recent universal victory the return of half of our population and Thank goodness she is Our brilliant museum scientist Miss Sersi, the person who will be and was always supposed to be giving your presentation today Thank you Mr Whitman Sorry, I am late everyone Today we will be learning about the importance of Apex predators in balanced ecosystem Poetry? I completely ran out of things to say and these kids make me nervous I thought you were very charming professor See you tonight oohh.. See you tonight?? Alright, settle down So Who can tell me what an Apex Predator is? Animals that hunt their prey for food Very good, Apex predators do hunt their prey for food like all predators but one thing that sets them apart is that there are no other animals in their habitat strong enough to hunt them Who can give me an example of an Apex predator? Lions Wolves Correct Earthquake Careful children, get down under the tables Let me help you.

If we'd protected humaninty from.. everything 7000 years You'd never have had the chance to develop the way you were meant to If the Deviants were eradicated a long time ago, why are you still here? We've been waiting to be told we can go home So... Ikaris.. The boy who flew too close to the sun Sprite made that story up when we lived in Athens And 5th Century BC? How long were you two together? 5000 years I guess you could call that long term What happened? He left I.. always thought he would come back but.. he never did So I moved on I am glad you did Sorry I have to go This morning, an unprecendented global earthquake swept nation states across the world causing damage and panic many speculating it's connection with the blip A Deviant healed itself They could never do that before It was coming after us instead of humans What's going on? I came to check on you because of the earthquake That Deviant is news to me Something is happening to Earth Can't be a coincidence We need to find the others I haven't seen some of them for centuries I doubt much has changed I am sorry to hurt you Sersi but we need to stick together Once I know you are safe, I will leave you alone Let's go to Ajak first She'll know what to do You hear that Sprite Family Re-union It's about time Hey, that one was mine.

Party?? Yeah.. He worked all night Who's talking to you? Get a life and where is Sersi? Late as usual I am sorry, I have something very exciting to show you, okay? Wait till you see this? What is it?

You know.. we could do that thing.. You know.. where you use your mind to control everything they could do and.. Hey Ajak, you listening to this? Fastos This steam..

Ladies and Gentlemen I present to you.. A plough Coz that's what it does Ploughs dirt I met another group of settlers who are building their houses in the northern fields They will need to plant their own crops Thanks Sersi Listen.. Humanity may be coming along slower than some of us want But there's no telling what wonders they will discover as they advance The world and its wonders are calling you Follow Gilgamesh and Enkidu in their battle May Their strength and bravery make you fearless you and your human brothers will live extraordinary adventures and will become legends Ohh... I just saw that There's so many other chairs man Come and have a drink with me Mm.. hmm I can't let you go and fight deviants on your own. We have to guard this city I didn't come to this planet to cower behind walls You know we need to trust Arishem's design for this planet hmm Thena It's an honour to fight along side you And you Beautiful Makkari You are late I was looking for items to exchange for the tablet all you have to do is lie I perceive the slightest vibrations Even the tiniest like your voice when you speak you wasted my time The Emerald Tablet is just a legend when humans come into conflict Ajak doesn't want us to intervene She also says that stealing is very very bad If you say nothing I say nothing Yeah I promise I wont let my feelings for Sersi distract me from my mission Humans are far from being able to protect themselves from the deviants We still have much to do Your faith in Arishem is true I can feel it But you are allowed to live a life Go tell Sersi how you feel Try it Sorry, I am making a mess not bad Alright Let me help you It matches your eyes you are very kind You are learning their language now If I want to spend more time with you, I need to get to know them I am very beautiful Wait, what did I say? You said, I am very beautiful You You are very beautiful Sersi I am yours Sersi If you'll have me May the gods unite you by the bond of marriage Congratulations Hello Ajak Ajak It was a deviant That was the last time I saw her Ajak asked me to check on Sersi So I went to London Turned out both of us were lonely and needed each other I guess in her way Ajak never stopped trying to take care of us Bye Ajak First time in 7000 years one of us has died I think the Deviant that attacked us in London killed Ajak and absorbed her powers Deviants have never done that in the past It healed itself just like Ajak I swear, I almost heard it speak Arishem Sersi, it is almost time Sersi, Sersi, are you ok? What happened Sersi? The sphere that Ajak used to talk to Arishem Came out of her body and went inside me Did you talk with Arishem Yes, he said, It's almost time Can you try talking to him again? I don't know how She chose you to replace her and she gave you the sphere Are you sure you talked to Arishem? What else would it by? Mah'd W'yry Wherre are the others? We had to separate There were more Deviants than you said I bet that was a lot of fun for you It was Once the others kill these last Deviants We will have eliminated them all from the planet Don't We don't interfere in their wars This isn't war, its genocide Their weapons have become too deadly Maybe it wasn't such a good idea helping them advance, Phastos Technology is a part of their evolutionary process, Druig It's not exactly something that I can stop No you can't but I can Calm down It's too late Thena, Everyone is going to die Are you ok? Thena Don't listen to your head Thena Listen to my voice that you are safe That you are loved and you are Thena Listen, stop, stop Is she ok? Sersi Thena, please. Come back to us I thought Mah'd W'yry was a myth There is no cure So no one really talks about it What happened? Thena You attacked everyone Wounded Sersi, Phastos You nearly killed Makkari I don't remember You have Mah's W'yry Your mind is fracturing under the weight of your memories and all I can do is erase you so that you can start over and we have to inform Arishm and take you back to the ship where we have the technology to help but it won't be thena anymore What if it happens again? She could have killed you. She could have killed all of us Please, I want to remember I want to remember my life Thena, I love you but listen to me It's not important that you remember or not Your spirit will remain You will always be Thena deep inside Trust me Why should she trust you? You are asking her to let you erase who she is Druig, I know you are upset Upset We have trusted you for 7000 years, and look where it got us I've watched humans destroy each other When I could stop it all in a heartbeat Do you know that that does to someone after centuries? Could our mission have been a mistake? Are we really helping these people build a better world, huh? I am just like the soldiers down there Pawns to their leaders Blinded by loyalty It ends now Let them go You are gonna have to make me Stop If you want to stop You are gonna have to kill me I will watch over Thena Let her keep her memories. One day when she attacks you You might have to kill her I'll take that chance You may all go The Deviants are gone There's no reason for you to stay with me Shouldn't you ask Arishem first? We are a team. We should stay together I didn't ask you for your advice, Ikaris Do not forget your place This is where we say goodbye You are free to go I want you to go out there and live a life for yourself not as soldiers Not with the purpose you were given Find your own purpose and one day When we see each other again I want you to tell me what you found Hello I am Karun Patel Kingo's valet Its truly an honour to be in the presence of the great Eternals Cut Okay everyone.

Hi.. Hello Hey, who's your gardener? Is that what you guys eat everyday? Yes Amazing Thank you All yours Help yourself This one is a trio wine, beer and mead made for the soldiers in the battle of troy That's so thoughtful Should she be drinking? Her's is non-alcoholic For kids I gave you the same thing Sprite I was just kidding Your's is a secret brew, Odin taught me as a Thank you after I helped him defeat Laufey in Tonsberg Ohh I am big baby Very mature Can you stop? Speaking of Odin, Thor used to follow me around when he was a little kid Now he is a famous Avenger and won't return my calls So now that Captain Rogers and Iron man are both gone Who do you think is going to lead the Avengers? I could lead them I figured I could do that Yeah, he would Ajak didn't even choose to lead us Whoa... Ouch.. Harsh I am gonna let that one slide because you know you have always been jealous that I could fly ohh. so what you can fly? I am better looking and everybody knows it I am just gonna get some air Hmm This is really good, Gil You know, I could sell it. Put my face on it, move some units I made this from corn. I chewed each Kernel myself and fermented it in my spit Is this the Centura-6 that Thena was talking about? Yeah, it's a planet She thinks she used to live there until it was destroyed Always talks about massive quakes ripping it apart Everyone died including herself We had an unprecendented global earthquake a few days ago Ohh.. that's what it was I thought I was drunk Ajak chose me to lead us but I can't even figure out how to speak to Arishem I have tried so many times Maybe you are trying too hard Sometimes, you just have to listen Sersi Arishem Ajak was killed by a Deviant We think it absorbed her power Something unusual is happening to Earth It is a side effect of the Emergence The Emergence? It is time for you to learn the true purpose of your mission You were sent to Earth to help the birth of the celestial tiamut Every billion years new celestials must be born I plan celestial seeds into host planets across the universe The planet Earth was chosen to host the celestial tiamut In order to grow Tiamat needs vast amounts of energy from intelligent life forms The Deviants prevented this by consuming humans until the eternals eliminated them Now, the human population of this planet has reached the required amount, It is time for the Emergence to begin but Everyone on Earth will die The end of a one, Cerce is the beginning of another Our universe is a constant exchange of energy An infinite cycle of creation and destruction Celestials use energy gathered from host planet to create suns Generating gravity, heat and light For new galaxies to form Without us, our universe will fall into darkness All life will die Ajak knew the truth She has helped many celestials to emerge for millions of years So have you all Earth was my first mission I was home At Olympia There is no Olympia This is your true home Sersi The world forge It is here I that I built and the programmed the Eternals Everything dies except us because we were never alive Why don't I remember any of this? Because your memories are erased and reset after each emergence They are stored here Why do you keep them? I keep them in order to study the deviants I created the deviants, Sersi for the same purpose I created you Every Celestial host planet has its own predators I first sent the deviants to exterminate them so intelligent life can grow but there was a flaw in the design They evolved became predators themselves and I lost control of them I built and programmed you eternals to be synthetic beings and incapable of evolution To correct my mistake Sersi, Ajak has chosen you to take her place as the prime Eternal Do not fail me So you are saying we are basically fancy robots And our past memories are stored somewhere In space and Arishem made the Deviants I am sorry Thena You tried to warn us Last time Arishem reset your memories, something must have gone wrong What do you mean? Well That's what Mah'd W'yry is, isn't it? Sll this time Thena was remembering all the other planets we were sent to and everyone dying during the Emergence I thought we were heroes Turns out we are the bad guys We are not the bad guys, Okay We have helped the Celestials expand life across the Universe That's not what bad guys do That's what good guys do Everytime innocent lives have been sacrificed for the greater good, it turns out to be a mistake We have to stop the Emergence Sersi We have no right to stop the birth of a Celestial There has to be a way, Tiamut can emerge without destroying the Earth We just have to delay it until we figure out how Could Drig control it's mind? Maybe Put it to sleep Put it to sleep? Are you serious? Gilgamesh asked Druig to put me to sleep once So, I could take a vacation to Fiji, you know We are talking about a Celestial, okay? We have to try, we are gonna not let everyone on Earth die. Right? Right I am human I am little biased The world is coming to an end. You take a flight and go home and do what? Watch TV? When I could be with the Earth's original superheroes As they try to save the world Fine If you want to Stay Thank you very much Sir Gilgamesh Could you please get rid of the Saliva beer? I thought you liked it We need to go Now To find the others Once we are all together We will decide what to do about the Emergence Hello It's very nice here, sir Don't be fooled Ignorance is bliss hi we're looking for druig Is he here? Yes, How do you know him? he's a friend from college Hello Sprite I've missed all of you Please Make yourselves at home You guys gave me a lot of bad news in one go my lady Will you help us? I am glad.. Hey, what's your service? I am not getting any bars Do you all remember this forest? Beautiful It's the last place we all lived together I've protected these people for 20 generations now From the outside world and from themselves Your kind, my friend You will be responsible for your own extinction one day What do you think? I think we must learn from our mistakes and do better Sir You must not give up hope Oh no, you didn't New rule, no more possessing people's minds Where is your sense of humour Kingo? I am sorry sir Don't apologise, it's not your fault You are not a God You know that, right? How Ironic? Kingo the movie star I've directed some things too Yeah, like what? Some internet content How many views? I don't do it for the views Let's go. He is wasting our time We need him Ikaris Missed you What.. you were gonna charm me or threaten me? There's a third option if you prefer that It must be heart breaking to find out that you are not mother's favourite I am sure she would be real proud of you Druig, this is serious? I'll tell you what's serious I've just been told I have been sent on a suicide mission for past 7000 years and that my entire existence is a lie So, excuse me for not giving a shit about your plan right now Druig sucks He does sir I don't like this place Druig needs a day and Sersi wants us to wait so we wait I couldn't recognise myself in Sprite's illusions Those were the good old days What if I can't fight anymore? Of course you can What if I hurt you again? Come on You know who you are You are Thena, Goddess of war Thank you For what? For always taking care of me I'd do it again On any planet I like watching him too Jesus I don't think it's creepy at all Have you read Peter Pan? To me, Ikaris is Peter Sersi is Wendy, you are tinker bell, for obvious reasons and the rest of us are the lost boys What's your point? Tinker Bell has always been in love with Peter and it's hard for her because she can never be with him I am sorry Sprite Kingo Why did Arishem make me this way? I don't know I thought you broke it Always bring back-up You have a very angry family sir Yeah, it's a big issue What about King Midas? Everything he touched turned to gold Was that you? Dane, call your Uncle What? My uncle? You always wanted to make amends with him right? Now's the time Trust me Sersi, you sound really Dane? Dane? You are breaking up You breaking up? How did he take the news? I couldn't bring myself to tell him that it was the end of the world It's nothing he could do Sersi I am worried about you If Arishem finds out you are trying to stop the Emergence I am not powerful enough to protect you I am not afraid This violence cycle has to end Hey, stop worrying about me What happened? Why did you leave? I told myself Something must have happened to you So, I waited Days became years but you never came back Sersi I've missed you I didn't mean to leave you There's something I... Ikaris Ikaris Madam Everything ok? Watch out Clear the camp Get Behind me One of them took Icarus Its an Ambush Very nice Sir Are you mental? Hide We need action sequences Sir Sprite, Get Karun out of here How many cameras did you bring young man? Kingo Come on Over there Quick Get in I have fought that one before Its stronger than the others No Terrible Timing Thena Thena Stop Thena Druig, Let them Go Now is not the time, Sersi Please, I know you are better than this What happened? Go, get to the river Gilgamesh A little help here Stay Here Say it Stay Good, You are okay They are headed for the camp Go, they need you Go Icarus Sprite, I need some time Can you hurry up? Now Dishoom Karun, did you get that? I did sir Kingo Go I am not leaving you Cerce, Are you all right? How did you do that? I don't know Stay back Ajak Our memories.. I understand now I can see what she saw So many planets So much life destroyed everytime a celestial is born Arishem used us and left us to die with each emergence We just wanted to survive Then he sent you I will kill you all for what you have done to my kind You are not saviours, Eternals. You are murderers Icarus Thena Remember No I'll remember I'll remember When I left, I thought about taking over the minds of every human on this planet Violence, Fear, Creed All Gone Why didn't you? Because, without their flaws They wouldn't be human Please Druig You can't stay here anymore These deviants are trying to keep us from killing their own kind They have a conscience now That makes them more dangerous No Sersi, That makes them us Eternals and Deviants Arishem's children But you are asking me to take control of a mind of Celestial I do not have that kind of power We'll need Phastos Well, good luck He gave up on humans a long time ago I did this If my technology hadn't helped them in past... Druig was right Our mission was a mistake These Peop... they are not worth saving Oh.. Phastos They are not worth saving Go on Alright Thats great Oh.. yeah Nice Ready? Ohh, so close Daddy, Daddy, watch this Okay, lets see Let me see it Dad, I am only a starter Hi Hello, can we help you? Hey Jack, Ben... Hey Guys These are my friends from college This is Sylvia And.. uh.. Isaac.. Isaac Dad, that's superman That's superman Really funny Jack, that is definitely not superman No Dad, he is superman, I saw him on TV He was in London fighting a monster and you were with a cape and you were shooting laser beams out of your eyes I dont wear a cape Okay, well, we should just go inside, right? Can I call you Clark? Is that what you go by now? Because, you know You've called me worse You're out Way to go Show me how its done Round and round and round... Good, Got it.. Keep going Yeah Incredibly natural guys So, after all these years Even you fell for Ajak's lies Do not rub it in It all makes sense why she wouldn't let us interfere with human conflicts Conflicts lead to war and war actually leads to advancements in life saving technologies and medicines So our mission was never to make a peaceful and harmonious world but to increase the population at all costs Just farming humans as food for the Celestials, right? That's bleak Well, so is telling your husband and child they could be dead within a few days I thought you had given up on humans I got lucky, okay I have a family now They give me faith again And I see the good in humanity in them Every single day So look, I cannot help you I am never leaving them Phastos I am sorry, Cerce It was wrong for me to use my powers without thinking about the consequences in the first place So now I choose to use my hands to fix my child's bicycle, okay Do you? I don't use my powers anymore Are you sure? What the hell is wrong with you? My child is right down the hallway That looks like someone been using his powers Ohh my god I bet he built the perfect safe-house I mean, what is this even made of? Vibranium? Don't Fall collection, IKEA Ass How did you even deal with this guy for over 5000 years? If you stay, you might as well invite Deviants to dinner Never mind waiting for the end of the world He has a point No, I'm sorry, you cant just show up at my life and expect me to go with you I am not gonna You have to go, my love You want me to go? You know what my mom would say to you right now, right? Stop procastinating and go solve your problems He's a chronic procastinator I am not leaving you two, no way I am not happy about it but if there is a chance for us to watch Jack grow up and have a life of his own, we should take it The Domo Foreboding atmosphere fills the air The eery stillness chokes our lungs What are you doing? You know you are creeping us out, you know that right? Ohh.. Oh god, stay calm Thena please Chips, it's just chips As you can see being an eternal does not preclude you from having human emotions Such as cowardice What is she doing? Is that a Sarcophagus in my lab? This is Makkari or should I say? Miss Havisham None of us have seen her for centuries That's it, we're finally going home Hmmm Is that the Ebony blade? Excalibur Arthur always did have a crush on you You mean.. that I have been waiting for centuries to return to Olympia but in fact it doesn't exist? That! and the world is ending at least I'm not going to be bored anymore Have you seen my movies? I don't have a DVD player DVD.. Huh? It's all about streaming now You know what you need - is a Kindle You know what that is? It's like a.. You know what I just realised that if you don't know what an iPad is It's impossible to explain So.. How did you end up scoring this? This Emerald Tablet.. my beautiful.. beautiful.. Makkari Did you miss me? I am sorry, what are we watching here? Because this.. This is new because I hate it Phastos, I need to control on my own Celestial Okay, get ready for it Bracelets, you made us bracelets So here's Celestial a little 101 Celestials are the most powerful energy generators in the universe When Arishem made us, he embued us with infinite cosmic energy to keep our bodies regenerating The bracelets in theory shut down our regeneration process Once that happens, our bodies accumulate extra cosmic energy What for? Well, the deviants can absorb our energy What if, we can absorb each other's energy as well If I can find a way to connect us all One of us could become immensely powerful pulling the accumulated energy from the rest Forming.... A Unimind Uni meaning one, mind meaning mind Ohh no, we heard you the first time Terrible name brainstorm... Brainstorm, that's a way better name No, I invented it so I am calling it whatever I want Let's say Druig succeeds in putting tiamut to sleep what do we do next? We find humans a new home on another planet Are we building a big ship too? Take a pair of each animal You know what's never saved the planet? Your sarcasm Space colonisation could take decades It can happen quickly with our help What if we accidently end up killing Tiamut? We can be responssible for billions of lives not being created across the universe Boss.. Am I right? Say something Icarus You dont think we should be doing this Ajak chose Sersi to lead us Sersi should decide Forget who Ajak chose You are the strongest, you should be making this decision Fine, just keep lying to yourself Sprite okay, this is not Icarus Don't run after him, Kingo, I.. Guys Hey, dont sweat it. Sprite's always cranky I used to hear her complaining even when she wasn't there I am ok, Kingo If you think we should do this, I trust you I trust you. I will follow you till the end like I always have What did you say? I will follow you till the end like I always have I am not who you think I am How long do we have? 7 days Good We completed our mission Where is she? London She has a good life there I am sure she's missed you If I'd gone back to her I would've only told her the truth She would've suffered Knowing this world she loves would end one day Ikaris We have to tell them the truth What? Why? Because together we might be able to stop the emergence Stop the emergence Ajak, I know its hard at the end Ikaris, I have followed Arishem for millions of years and I have never doubted him Until now Why now? Why now? 5 years ago, Thanos erased half of the population of the universe Delayed the emergence but the people of this planet brought everyone back with a snap of a finger You know.. After I let you go, I travelled the world living among them I have seen them fight lie and kill but I have also seen them Laugh and love I have seen them create and dream This planet and these people have changed me The cost of Arishem's design, it's not worth it Not this time I trust you Ajak I will follow you till the end as I always have Thank you We have to bring everyone back together There's something I have to show you first It's just up ahead They must have been trapped in the ice for centuries and broke free last week when the glaciers started to melt As the earth's core heats up for the Emergence They have killed an entire company of oil workers and I attracted them here I suspected that you might have changed your mind I can't let you betray Arishem Why don't you just kill me yourself? When the others realise something is happening to the Earth The will come to you when they find your body, they will know that the deviants are back That will keep them busy until the Emergence I have been loyal to you Ajak Kept your secret for centuries Lied to everyone I cared about But never have I doubted my purpose to serve the celestials No, Ikaris I led you down the wrong path It's the only path I know Thought I would find you here I have thought about this place a lot Amazing how things change over time Maybe we are the ones who changed I know you don't agree with our plan I have always thought of the Celestials like oceans They give life and they take life away without bias If they were gone, this universe will eventually end What you are trying to do is free humanity from natural order It's not natural to allow all life or the entire planet to be destroyed Arishem's way is archaic and violent I don't want to fight Sersi It'll all end soon Except, there is no end. is there? We'd carry on without our memories or free will for eternity You are afraid I wouldn't mind leaving this world I only wish that when we do I would be able to remember you I am in love with you Sersi and I am grateful for the life I have lived with you Ikaris Sersi It's started Oh no... God What about the Unimind I haven't figured out a way to connect us but I am close, I am very very close How much longer? I don't know Sersi Find the point of Emergence You always knew the end was coming It must be a relief That deviant is still tracking us Revenge won't bring peace for you Thena Killing him might Ikaris What are you doing? I wanted you to leave this world in peace without knowing about the Emergence but I failed I wish Ajak hadn't chosen you I am close to figuring it out Boss, what are you doing? I've let this go on long enough Don't hurt him He lied to us He already knew about the Emergence No, he didn't Ajak told me everything when we left Babylon What? You were never gonna let us stop the Emergence No I only wanted to protect you from the Deviants If Ajak wanted you to take her place, why did she choose me? What have you done? He killed her I had to She loved you Did she? She loved you Did you think it was easy to live with the truth? To know that one day all of this would end To keep on lying to you If we gave humanity the choice How many of them would be willing to die so that billions more could be born We are not giving them a choice Is this.. why you are willing to kill? You are so pathetic I am an Eternal, Phastos I exist for Arishem As do you This is who you are I will not change a single thing about who I am Born or made but I do not exist for Arishem I exist for my family Then you are making the same mistake Ajak did I found Tiamut No Get out of here Kingo You do not turn against your family Gilgamesh died because of you You won't succeed against me and I will kill every one of you if I have to Wait I am going with you Sprite What is this? Why did she leave with Ikaris? Because she loves him Oh you guys didn't pick up on that He really fooled us. Didn't he? Karun, let's go Wait, where the hell are you going? I can't help you guys I still think Ikaris is right So that's it? huh? Just gonna follow him? I love the people of this planet but if you stop this Emergence You are preventing so many other worlds like this one from being created I still have faith in Arishem but I refuse to hurt any of you for my beliefs We need you Even with my help, we are no match It's Ikaris but I hope to see you on the next planet Everything you did for us we are grateful It is a big honour for us I will miss all of you guys Look If I am going to get myself killed going up against Ikaris We are gonna need to have a backup plan All of our powers even if they are amplified are not enough to kill a celestial Sersi did turn a Deviant into a tree I am sorry, what? You don't want to tell me that You have never been able to do that before I don't know how it happened okay? I am pretty sure I couldn't do it again Well, now is the time to try. Don't you think? Phastos, that Deviant is dead Our plan is to put Tiamut to sleep not to kill it I can't kill a celestial Sersi, Sersi We can't We can't It's ok Sersi I got this There's no time for that I didn't see the lies right in front of me I am not even sure why Ajak chose me to lead I asked Gilgamesh once Why he chose to protect me? He said When you love something, you protect it It is.. the most natural thing in the world You have loved these people since the day we arrived So there is no one better to lead us now than you Sersi Get up Ajak chose you for a reason Sersi Sersi, we need you I already gave that speech What? You did? What? Sersi, the sphere inside of you creates a connection between you and Arishem Maybe, I can repurpose it Create a connection between well.. all of us and that can activate the Unimind Great Yeah! But.. Um.. I have to take it out of you okay Do it Okay Don't kill her Thena Do it Will it work? It has to I am glad you are here Thank you Sprite Protect the Emergence You really going to kill them Where's Druig? He's busy Thena Play nice You have never had to fight me But I have always wanted to It's time to put it a god to sleep I should've done this 5 centuries ago Druig's gone It's over Phastos Let's try and stop this I need to get closer to Tiamut Keep Ikaris busy We've got you, Go Enough Why are you helping Ikaris? We can't let it absorb our powers Too late Thena, he's trying to provoke you Where's Sersi? You always did underestimate her Oh no.. not so fast Boss I don't know about you but this is really satisfying. Right? Let me go Phastos, I can't let her do this I don't think so I have been wanting to clip your wings for a long time, Ikaris Thena Ohh you have changed You're broken Damaged Useless You can't protect any of them Sersi You are not powerful enough to do this And you won't You are not a killer Maybe I've changed and is this really who you are, Sprite? Are you really willing to let everyone on this planet die? I am sorry Sersi I have always envied you Sersi because you get to live as one of them and I never could You know why I hated living with humans? Because they reminded of things that I didnt even know I wanted Because of them, now I want to know what it feels like to grow up To fall in love To have a family And to know in the end I've lived It's all over now We get to start over somewhere new Well, that was very moving Druig I can't do this This is your fight now Thena It's me Gilgamesh look at me Stay here Say it Stay You'll be ok Give me your hand You and I We are just tools of a God built to kill Thena Remember I remember Come on Sersi Come on It's beautiful isn't it? I am sorry I know How? How did you do it? When I touched him, his arm. I felt energy surging into me Tiamut joined our Unimind I always wondered how we survived the destruction of other planets that we were on By being connected to the Celestial that emerged We were one Even Ikaris and Sprite Grace to Tiamut Is he gone? Sprite I still have energy from Unimind I think I can make you human All the things that you said you wanted, you can have them But your time will come fleeting and you will die one day Are you ready for that? I am The sudden appearence of an enormous stone figure in the Indian ocean has left more questions than answers for authorities You guys did that? I love you so much Are you ok? I get confused sometimes Yeah Me too So dad said you are the Goddess Athena Thena, drop the A What's your superpower ohh.. ok.. alright That's sharp Almost gave you a shave and a haircut Let me see what's happening actually Remember your superpower we practiced Thank you so much You know that your baby sitting priveleges are completely revoked right? Thank you, Thank you Violence hey.. Violence is never the answer, right, Thena You've gotta always choose your brain Like you did fighting on the beach Your dad.. spoke calmly and firmly to the bad guy and he had no choice but to listen to me, so.. The boy is 10 years old He is not a fool When are you guys leaving? When is that happening? That's happening soon right? Don't go anywhere near him That's far enough Jack Wow Dad, Domo is so cool Your dad fixed it with his bare hands Can I go to space too one day? Let's wait until you get your learner's permit, okay? Hey Phastos Take care This world is lucky to have you Thank you I know you are not a hugger, so ohh. okay Think we will find other Eternals out there? and they will accept truth the way that we do because the truth will set you free I told you that thing was addictive Please visit I'll try If I can get time off from school Oh wow, listen it's gonna be good for you to be in a human environment You'll pick up some social skills Oh.. you didnt think you needed those That explains so much I am gonna miss you Me too Madam Thanks man Sometimes I wonder if we did the right thing Killing Tiamut Too late for that You followed your heart We all did Even Ikaris Looks like someone's waiting for you He's a lot cuter in person So after all that, you still can't change me into a Giraffe Well, I.. I could next I am connected to a Celestial during an Emergence while connected to a Unimind Yeah.. sounds like a lie to me What do we do now? Not sure This planet is my home but.. I can't pretend to be human anymore I love you Sersi I don't care what you are Remember when we talked about no more secrets I have no more secrets, I promise Actually I have one I want to tell you What is it? Turns out my family history is complicated Sersi Sersi, what's wrong Sersi Sersi Sersi Sersi You've chosen to sacrifice a Celestial for the people of this planet I will spare you but your memories will show me If they are worthy to live and I will return for Judgement Weeks have passed We have not heard from any of them It's like.. they have disappeared Arishem We have to go back I'm sorry too What?
