So I can stop like shit like this from happening. It's hard to help people while moping around. Hey, how about you? To help people and I've always been a bit of an adrenaline junkie. Fair enough. There's not a day that I don't think if I if I could have got the Polaroids a little sooner I could've saved them. A pile of Polaroids in a bundle of leaves. Pictures of the young girls murdered. Tonight we revisit the Art Bailey kidnappings and explore the eerie circumstances surrounding the evidence appearing after Bailey and his house burned to the ground. I heard a crash and thought a tree had blown down outside the station. When I got out there my partner and I discovered them sitting neatly in the middle of a pile of leaves. Given the fact that the Polaroids were found after Art Bailey's death could there have been an accomplice? No. Could there be an accomplice? Yeah.

Do you not know the meaning of the word vacation? I thought you'd want to know we have 15 minutes of footage missing from the security camera at the evidence locker. What do you mean missing? It's just gone, sir. Should I come in? I wouldn't. Are you sure? Honestly though, you probably should. Officer Jones wants to speak to you. So after the party, it was like a pre-pary. So I went to class for the first time and then found out he was my teacher. No seriously, he was my teacher. It was somebody. Hey, Kai is a douchebag. He's horrible. Such a douchebag. He is. He is. He's cute though. No, no he's horrible. No don't do anything with him. Aw, Violet. He's got a cute butt though so that's worth it. No. Oh yeah. How many have you had? Were you sneaking shots. What are you doing? Want to see a trick, watch this. No! Voilet! No! I'm out. I'm out. I'm out. Are you gonna be able to do this? Oh yeah, yeah. I'm fine. You know, we have time before the concert, if you need to swing by the office. Thank god, this is going to drive me crazy. Well we're still going. Oh yeah, we're going. Tonight. You bet. We're... We're going to be there watching front row. Watching the the four boys to guys. For sure. Okay. It'll be real quick. All right. Take no time at all. I'm just so done with guys because they're the fucking worst. So girls, that's hot. I deserved that. But you know what I hate? How guys can't even make jokes about shit like that because there's so much objectification of women. So your brought us a douche bag. Sorry about that, guys. I mean least Courtney's having a good time, you know? It's not like all lesbians are hot. Trust me most aren't. He's going to say whatever he wants to get into her pants and... Courtney's no dummy. That's a fake smile. She's only in it for a short game. Thank god for that, I'd die if she dated that douche-canoe. What's that? Nothing bro. Shots? We're gonna be there. Yes. 4boyz. Yes. Going to concert. I thought that there were three boys. Four boys. Sounds like girls. They're boys. They're kinda high pitched. Oh I'm sorry but you know we can't all listen to like Def Leppard or Metallica or. You do not speak of Def Leppard badly in this house. Are we going to count it? Okay. How do you know these people? We went to high school elementary school. It's been a long long time. College was the first time away from. You would vouch for them? Vouch for them? Vouch for them. Like? Vouching like a voucher? A Voucher? You know what I mean. Would you defend them? Yeah. Yeah? Go! You're very calculating. Yeah. Some people would call me a hunter. I just say that I'm more of a renaissance man, you know? Good at everything? A little bit, yeah. You know in an alternate timeline, it would be you and I having sex tonight. With each other? You don't feel the tension? No. You know those times when a friend embarrasses you so much you just want to disown him. He's still your friend? Sorry. Hey Kai! Yeah, man, ugh. The picture threw me off. The flash. Sure. All right, do not let the battery die down. I'll be right back. You have 15 minutes and then we have to go. 15. I promise. Let's do it. I told you to go enjoy your vacation. I know. Don't worry. This case hasn't been reopened. We're just trying to find out how someone got in here. What'd they take? His camera. Why the camera? Probably just some creep fanatic celebrating the anniversary of Bailey's death. Or maybe somebody looking to make an extra buck by appointing some grim paraphernalia. So you still won't consider the possibility. Of an accomplice? David we've been through this a million times. There's no evidence that Bailey was working with an accomplice. If someone else was involved, wouldn't there have been another disappearance by now? Unless they saw what happened to Bailey and they're just laying low. David I told you to trust me I can handle it. Go on your vacation. Officer Martin said someone tampered with the security footage. Are you sure whoever did this didn't, you know, have help from the inside? You're seeing ghosts where there aren't any David. I.T. IS LOOKING AT THE FOOTAGE NOW. THERE'S NO REASON FOR YOU TO BE HERE. We Put out an alert to local camera specialist, pawnshops, and thrift shops with the description of the camera. We've already got a lead on a pawnshop in town. Did you know that the Japanese government is getting involved to try and stop people from working themselves to death. They want people to take more vacation days. Really? Does it work? Well, not yet. Hey, What's the name of that pawnshop? We still have plenty of time to make the show, okay? Look if for some reason we don't make the show I will fly you to wherever they're touring next. London? In the US. That's not until forever. Then we better not miss this show huh? No no. I gotta make one more stop. Dad! Hey guys, check this out. You're my man. Don't talk about it. Not my man-man but like my wingman. Don't talk about it. I see you push me in the corner over here. You scared? I'm a little bit intimidated. Scared? I wouldn't say scared, but it's intimidating. I'll back off. I don't want to intimidate you. No no no no. I didn't say you should back off. Oh yeah? Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. It was the wind. The wind. All right. Everyone over here. We need a group pic. One after we swim? Yes. All right. Everyone get in here. Smile. Nice and big. One. Two. Three. Is that it? That's it! Wait, it will come out. It will come out. Hello? No, she was there when I left. Everything all right? No that's fine I'll head home. It's fine. I'll see you in a bit. Is everything okay? Yeah. My parents can't find my sister. It's fine though you know she goes out all the time without telling us. I'll be back, okay? Do you want me to come with? No, I'll be fine. Just keep an eye on the horndogs. Hey Kai! Don't forget to wrap it up buddy. Oh, hey. I got the whole thing timed out, don't worry buddy. Oh shit. Oooooh okay. What? What? I think that's a skill. All right? I'm going to go to the bathroom. Don't drown. But seriously I'll kill you. Jen. Jen where you've been, mom and dad have been worried sick. Jen. So you know how people after sex always have to pee? Hi there, sir. What brings you in today? I was wondering have you received any cameras lately? Well we do receive a few cameras every few days. This would've been this morning or yesterday. It's a Polaroid. Man, sure is windy out, isn't it. Well now that you mentioned it we actually did receive a report for a missing camera. But why do you want it? I'm with the police. Well how am I supposed to know that sir. Well we did have one but we sold it earlier. Who did you sell to? Uh. I don't know. She didn't leave a name or anything. She paid in cash. Oh well we do have security cameras. Did you want to maybe check that out? That'd be great. So how do you know Alex? Actually I just met him this year. We met at school. Hey, you okay? Oh! What happened? I don't know. What? Can you tell me something about her... maybe something she was wearing or personality or something. She was really quick witted. Shit. She might. Think about it. Oh she was uh she was wearing a black dress. I know who it is. Dad! Morgan! What is it? What's wrong? I'm here just tell me what you saw. Courtney? Fuck. Judy! Courtney! Courtney! Violet! What did you do? It Was an accident. It was an accident. She must have fallen. Why why did you do that? Evidence. I didn't do it. Kennedy, I didn't do it. Morgan please help me. I saw. I don't know. It looked like you won't believe me. It looked like one of the kids from the Old Bailey murders. I know it sounds crazy. Can we go? Can we still go to the concert? I have to go back to the house to find Violet. Kennedy! Kennedy! I didn't do it. Stop blaming me. I saw you! I have evidence! No. Kennedy get the fucking picture. Just give me the fucking picture. I'm not giving it back. Hey. Do you even know what vacation means? I think I have a lead. Send a car over to the Tigard pawnshop and pick up the owner for questioning. Funny thing, I'm standing in the pawnshop now it's empty. Door was wide open but nobody's home. I'll call you back. Guys. He killed Violet and Courtney. He was gonna kill me. Kennedy, those things outside. What? There's beasts and outside right now. Is he dead? Violet and Courtney are dead too. He killed them. No fuck Kennedy. KENNEDY No it wasn't him.

Would you mind waiting here in case to come home. I gotta go look for them. I want to stop by Courtney see if they're there. I need to talk to Violet about her camera. Look keep the door locked. Call me immediately if they come home. But can't I come with you? I'm scared. But if they come home. I know. Just be home soon. Okay? Oh hey David, I thought it was Courtney. She's always forgetting her keys. Courtney is not here. No I thought she was at your house with her friends. Well they were supposed to be there. They might be at Alex's house. Do you know parents? No I've never met them. I think his father's name is Greg or something like that. You know it's not like Courtney to run off somewhere and not tell me. Do you think everything's fine? I'm sure there's nothing to worry about. Yeah. Hey I'm uh I'm David, Kennedy's dad. I think we've might have met... uh. Greg? Steve.
