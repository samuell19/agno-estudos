Yeah, like they say, "from dust to dust.” This is my bedroom, right here, was my bedroom. Yeah? Yeah. It's kind of dusty too. You got that right. It was always dusty. Okay, what's so funny? I see you laughing, what's so funny? I was just thinking about how super dude must have looked when they dug him up in the junkyard! And the skunk had the nerve to live to tell about it! God damn! How come you didn't do it? Do what? Kill him. Wasn't necessary. Look, man, you just don't shoot a guy. I mean, killing just ain't that easy. Not cold like that. Michael, any chump can shoot a man down but it takes a real man to get to another man's heart. The bullets in the gun, the bullet was a blank. They killed bummie. I ain't hardly forgot. We're going for the main dude tomorrow. Come on. Here you go, sergeant. Not bad. It's not bad. I'm gonna recommend you for a promotion. It's nice. It's nice. Going on parade or something? Nah.

I can't punk out on those guys tomorrow. I can't. It's all right for you to punk out on me. What you mean by that? Wwhat do you mean by that, huh? You call humpin' in the cab all day "punking?” I'm supporting you, ain't I? Barely. What more do you want? More. That's all. More. Listen, baby, it ain't never been about money between us, 'cause we ain't never had none. Every cent you bring in the house is a blessing. But I... Need more of you. I could get more if you could give less to that gang of yours. Listen, Joan, listen. Listen, this is the last time out for me. I mean it, I talked it over with chaka and he's takin' over. I ain't jokin' a pound, baby. After tomorrow, it's quits. Now, I love you. I love you. But I can't let them down tomorrow. Are you feeling okay? Pull! Hey, man, you're pretty good! Just gotta develop a feel for 'em. Of course, this little baby here helps. Nice shot. Hey, thanks. You ought to join the Turkey shoot. Turkey shoot? You havin' a Turkey shoot, when?

They came in and they did a number on me. I'm signing the guy up and he pulls a gun on me. They were pretty old then, huh? No, they weren't pretty old, they were young. Help me with the can! Come on, come on! Chaka! Come on, come on, come on, man! There's nothing we can do about it, come on! If they went across the place, they're in here somewhere. They probably run into that area there. Come on. Come on. Come on! Man, that's my brother, man! Come on, shit, come on! Listen, I saw some movement, go around the side. Yeah. Blood. I'm going back out. No, no, don't be stupid, man.
