Someone once told me, a woman's lingerie is like her deepest secrets She's mortified of people finding out, yet desperately wants people to know Time's up Miu Ho I'm Lena, the COO here Pop quiz: what was the third bra on the lower left side of the red heart shaped sports bra inside the showroom? What's the answer? It was... a shade of blue, not the sad bluesy hue, but the cheerful, fresh kind of blue It was a plunge bra with wire support made of lycra and has a jewel stitched on center front How about the lace Y shaped T-back, what was the third pair on its lower left side? It was... an elegant and graceful black colored, fully laced with Swiss embroidery, and weaved floral trimmings, seductive undergarment It was a huge hit with 40 years old and above women last year Yeah, that one! You've got a good memory, but you think with too much sensitivity It's ok to be sensitive You have something to ask? What does a good memory have to do with being a designer? Honestly speaking, every lingerie company consults its competition's styles and designs I often send junior designers to survey the competitors' shops and exhibits I can't have our team snapping pictures everywhere Understand? I think you need a deeper understanding of lingerie You have a 3-month probation before we hire you as a junior designer I'm going to give you a mission to complete Utilize your sensitivity to complete a comprehensive research on lingerie I need to think of a right title for you Lingerie esearcher Lingerie Researcher?

Just practicing Buddha chants Experts say it's quite laxative But you're a pharmacist Couldn't you just get your own laxative?

Uncle How the heck would I know? Truth is, before I started dating Ray, I went out with a much older guy But he just let me down and had hurt me so badly I want him to know how hurt I was I know... What do you know? She said she wanted that older guy to know She couldn't have been clearer, of course I know The truth is that older guy is... a jerk You're way too young It's better if you see someone closer to your age Right, darling? Of course... That means you're fine with me seeing Donut? I am not... objecting to it That's good to know, thanks Uncle! Shall we?

I meant to be forceful with your moans, not your bounce Bravo!... Great!... Don't... Yes!... Bravo!... Great... I'm coming!... Hey... Come back!... That's great Miu! That's great Sir? Hi! You live nearby? Just a floor down from you, where the air hostess lives Not sure for how long We're not what you think we are. It's weird That night he told me about their arrangement There's a co-pilot up there Now so I need to excuse myself And you don't mind? It's all part of the understanding I don't fit the profile of her targets So... I mind, I do mind That's why I needed someone to talk to Please keep it to yourself though, or I won't even have a chance to mind Hello? Yes... Didn't work out? Just keep looking then Should I just come cook something up for you? Ok, bye-bye Bye-bye Bye, prince Lucas Lucas is here! No need to look away Look at me, I am so happy What made you so happy? T oday I finally feel like a real man I have finally tasted... I'm too embarrassed to say You don't have to I feel you need to know What? Last night, Miu and I did... Did?... Did... Did it! Bravo! Did you know it was also Miu's first time? Happy for me? Sure But you don't look like you do Better? So great... You look like you want to hear about the details Not exactly What do you mean? I really do but am ashamed to ask for it That's great... Like a bird I flew into her wet nest Fragrance emanated from her essence I raised my left arm, she used her right hand We glided through endless space together I used my sword to dance with her Her petals fall one by one At long last the crystal and the iceberg collide mightily We waded through the winter cold together and entered the ninth... Iayer of heaven Bravo!... Was that too descriptive? It was just right That's great I know you two are very good friends And now that we have consummated our love I feel like I have to take on the responsibility Of course I don't know how to ask her hand in marriage I've kept to myself for far too long I need a suitable person to make the first move for me Sir... What? The two models for the Summer campaign are here Will you take a look at them? These two? Very good These two are our work mates You have to look that way What's the difference? These two are buck naked, those two are overdressed Will you just take a look at them? What does he mean? For you What's the occasion? Well... where should I begin? I was never ever at a loss for words You can begin by telling me what you feel about me Sure... I think you're really simple So simple, you're really cute too Girls like you are hard to find these days And you can be silly sometimes, the kind of silly that men fall for I just think dating you will be really fantastic So if you don't mind... I would really like to ask your hand I hope you... accept. Also this It's all happening too fast Not really, it's been a while Didn't we just start now? Not you and l Then who with? You and Prince Antonio Didn't you fly through ninth heaven the other night? He felt since he had made love to you He needed to shoulder some responsibility I respect that Let me ask you Did you volunteer to represent Antonio today? Of course You honestly believe I should marry him? You both... had your first night and it was memorable You're going to be the boss's wife Do you or do you not? I... think so You're the biggest jerk in the world The first day we met, you got me drunk and took me to a love hotel Fortunately it didn't happen that night If it did, what am I supposed to do now? Then you coached me how to attract men by telling me all these bad things about men I've lost all illusions towards the opposite sex And in order to curry favors with your boss, you're even making a proposal on his behalf You're no better than a dog No better Actually let me correct myself Dogs are way cuter than you are! Hey, so is that a yes? I need to go back to him with an answer! You think I enjoy proposing on his behalf? I know who I am You didn't have to dump it all on me like that Sorry for misunderstanding your motives Miu? I sat across from you, I saw your sadness I've never wept for a guy before This is the first time ever I don't now why I'm crying over a guy like him File 2, Name: CC, Occupation: PR CC spent all her savings to attend Eugene's party What a beautiful skirt Find me a set of undergarments that match Ok Stop fussing over these and find me something Does it work? Let's see Do you like it? It works perfectly How about here? Great T oo tight? And here? No problem Try the skirt on Perfect Do you like it? It's great That day, me and Donut just looked like fitting a wedding gown for a bride I've never seen CC this excited before Look Do you like my outfit? Do I look pretty? We're not going We're not? They refused to accept you They said I was stupid I never knew they were like that discriminatory Bastard! Why don't you go on your own? I'm fine. Look, I'm fine I'll never give you up I'll never give you up That night CC not only lost everything she owned but also a heart that has expected to be in love Hey, I'm so tired Where did he go? Don't be afraid. I'm a lingerie researcher I just want to interview you, I won't call the cops I want to know if you're a pervert You can say that I am Then I want to know what attracts you to lingerie in the first place Lingerie is like a woman's deepest secrets They want people to see what they're wearing, yet afraid to show all of it They'll show you glimpses of it from time to time but they'll try their best not to show its entirety to you Where do you keep the lingerie you steal? All here? Just some of it There's more? Every piece here represents a lady's secret That blue one over there? A nurse secretly in love with her patient The white lacey one belonged to an air hostess who wants to marry a rich guy And this purple one over here... belonged to the lonely former tenant in your flat Aunt Lara? Emergency hotline? I'm under a bee attack Send someone to rescue me Not a hive, just one bee Not a significant number? Ok, let's forget about that Can you ask for me then if there are... off duty firemen 41-inch chest or so, hardened ones, someone resembling Rain or Aaron Kwok. I prefer Aaron See if they are willing to help a... fair looking, single and lonely, rotund career woman Remember to call me if you find anyone My surname is Ho My number should come up on your caller lD The bee's here again, talk to you later Bye Your auntie fought that bee for an entire evening Regardless of that, they eventually died one after the other Are women lonely because they don't have men in their lives? Or because they refuse to unclasp? The clasp isn't on their bra's, it's in their hearts I realize the person who's most knowledgeable about lingerie is a self aware pervert who's into stealing them I'll probably pay him another visit soon This is probably the last time I fall in love As my son, you don't want to take that away from me I should be telling mom about you but I'm not going to This is my first love after all How could you be fighting your son over a woman? Enough! I'm the one being fought over, I should get to choose Yes, let Donut pick the winner Sorry Ray, I know you love me a lot But I like your dad more I couldn't feel the same for you, you're too young Daddy! You once told me... you would give me anything and everything Now you're taking away my first love I don't have a father like you, I don't want a father like you My girlfriend, my son I can't lose my son over a girl, I'm sorry Say that once more and I'm leaving My girlfriend, my son...

Where are you going, silly boy? What happened? That was fast? You guys got it on right away?

I know... you I know you I'm not giving up my dream to marry a rich guy for you I already know that I don't know if Celine ever gave up that goal But she did, on this night at least Ok, change the pose Think of a tune, let's play some music, ok?

Since everyone here is truthful, let me tell the lies One word review, dreadful You're so lying Hilarious Yeah, she's the funniest I'm extremely unfunny I'm not here to tell jokes I thought it through, I'm saying no Sorry, I didn't realize you'd get so hurt You didn't hurt me, you hurt yourself by giving up on a perfection incarnate and the bright future we could've shared You're so stupid, how could you be so stupid? Say something! Why do you made him cry? I want you to clarify our relationship Lucas! Get out of the way, narcissist I've had enough of you Do you know how selfish you are? You really think the universe revolves around you? My narcissism is better than your insecurity She didn't say she didn't want you, you rejected yourself You got no guts to go after her Go after whom? Miu Even the bimbo here can see through it clearly You punched me out of no reason because she left Was I really like that? Yes... I've seen many love story endings in the movies It's always the guy chasing after the girl running like mad on the streets Hey! I don't know if I'm going to be moved but I do want to be chased after for once whichever one of them will be fine You asked me to clarify our relationship for you I have an answer for you When I failed to bed you, I thought we can be good friends and I wanted to be the one to teach you how to get men But I get more upset with every man you meet I do know plenty of men, none of them my type though I want someone who lets me call the shots but end up making all the decisions for me I want to find someone who does everything I tell him to do but make me want to do the same for him I want to be a woman with successful career but I don't want to have to work all that hard I'm mortified that you are fooled by the others but I can't fool you When you and Antonio had sex, I felt really sad You mean that one time we had safe sex? What? Safe sex for him was... he does his own and I do mine Masturbation? I want a passionate relationship but I don't want to get hurt You're the worst guy I know But I don't know why I would cry for you I also thought I could claim your virginity only to have you conquer mine You're still...?
