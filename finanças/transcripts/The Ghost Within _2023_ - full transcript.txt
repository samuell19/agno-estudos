[silence] [music] [thunder rumbling] [footsteps] [footsteps] [thunder rumbling] [music] [thunder rumbling] [music] Back to bed Margot now! [music] - You heard your father. [music] Original Sub By ViKramJS [clock ticking] [music] [knocks] [door opening] [music] [laughing] [music] [humming] [sighing] [Key turning] [Breathing heavily] [Door opening] [Music] [Breathing heavily] [silence] [breathing heavily] -Margot, during your last annual review, you were showing, continued exceptional mental health, and were just about to celebrate your 5th wedding anniversary if I remember rightly? - Yeah, I still can't imagine my life without him. Have you suffered any relapses over the last 12 months? - No. Not at all. No more visio. I can't remember the last time we had an incident. Talking years. - Margot, tell her the truth. - It was just a dream. - It's all too common for those who suffer traumatic childhood experiences. For those symptoms to reappear.- There's nothing wrong with me. Not anymore. [silence] Recently, an old friend, Douglas, he was in charge of the estate, he passed away. Well, it starts brings with it back. - The lost memories. - Well, not just that night, but entire year. It's like I'm rediscovering this lost part of my life each night, little by little. - Those long lost memories of your childhood are never really lost. You maybe suppress them to spare yourself pain. If we just stop this downward trajectory, then... - I need to remember. I need to remember everything. I've run from the truth my entire life, never believing that I was strong enough to face it. I was wrong. Now, I'm ready. [music] I need to know why-why it happ. [music] Help me remember, please. [music] - Memories are based on our senses, sights, sounds. Go back to that house. Walk around in the shoes of your childhood self for a few days. It will come flooding back to you. But be careful. You're showing clear signs of regression. You may add fuel to a fire we fought so hard to contain. If your mental health declines Mrs. Richardson, I fear your days at Abingdon Asylum could be far from over. [music] [door closing] [music] [key sounds] - I'm not sure about this. - I should have done this years. [music] [music] - This is where you grew up? You never told me your family were wealthy. - What does it matter? - Well, what happened to it? The money? I mean, we're barely making ends meet. - I refuse to accept my inheritance. - Why? - I'll never take a penny from my father. [silence] [bird sounds] [car door opens] [car door closes] [silence] [bird sounds] - Dad. [music] [music] [footsteps] - You okay? [bird sounds] [keys clingling] Lead the way. [bird sounds] [crow cowing] [footsteps] [switch clicking] Trust you weren't raised in total darkness. [sighing] [footsteps] A countryside not even a single. [footsteps] So, it was just you, your father, and Douglas the Butler that lived here, is that right? - My father's girlfriend, Nancy, would often stay the night too. - I also had a younger sister. Her name was Evie. - You told me you were an only child. - I tried to keep you away from all of this. - Sometimes, it feels like I don't even know you.

[music] It's much better. I don't know why you insist on wearing it. - She could scare a child looking through the window. - Well, let them look. I don't want you hiding away from the world any longer. [music] You're beautiful. [music] Just the way you are. [music] [wind blows] [wind blows] [gasps] [Eerie music] [breathing heavily] [music] [footsteps] [footsteps] - This must all be worth a fort. - We're not selling any of it. - I just don't understand why you're holding on to everything if it holds no value to you. I've only just found out that we have all this money just sitting there and then... - Please. [footsteps] [music] [music] - Margot, sure you're alright? - Yeah. It's just a lot to take. - Of course. [Sheet rustling] Look what I found. [footsteps] You look so happy. - That was... - Is that her? Your sister? Evie was severely disfigured. She lived a tortured existence. Nancy took an instant dislike to the both of us. Evie was a little different. She was the easiest of targets. - Poor girl. - This was taken just months be. - You evre going to tell me what happened that night or at least what you remember. - What's the first thing that comes to mind when you look at my father? - He looks like a good man? A loving father. - We never knew our mother. She died when we were both really little. It created a special bond between the 3 of us. All of that changed the night Evie was murdered. - I'm so sorry. - She suffocated to death, screaming, begging for her life or, so he told the police. - They found her killer? - When they found her body buried in the woods, they took my father away. He confessed to everything. Before I had the opportunity to see him again, he was dead. The official report said that he was killed by an inmate. [music] I never got the opportunity to ask him why. [music] And now, I'll never know. [music] [Dog barking] [opens door] [Wind] [footsteps] [drinks] [music] [indistinct clicking sound] [music] [clock ticking] [door closes] [screams] Open the door. - Open the door! [knocks] Mason! Mason! [Banging] [Door opening] Mason! Get out the way! [gasps] - It's okay, I'm here. Breathe. [gasps] See you back on the wine. Why did you lock the door? - I didn't. - I can't help you if you lock me out. And I won't be here to look after you tomorrow night. - You're still going. - You don't turn down Henry Hargreaves. - So you putting him before your wife. - I can't pass up this opportunity. He's the only publisher in London that hasn't turned me down. - You can't just leave me on my own. I'm struggling to... [thumps] -Margot, please. This isn't a discussion. You chose to come here. I can't pass up this opportunity. I'm leaving tomorrow night. [music] [music] Good. [Music] Let me take you home. On rout. - He doesn't know where I am. Can I escape my own thoughts now, can I? They're only tolerable with you by my side. [music] - I'll be back with you this time tomorrow. I promise. - You're just walking away. - This is the one, Margot. I'm coming back with a book dea. I know it. [footsteps] [music] - Ghost sightings are the byproduct of a tortured mind. We conjure supernatural images that bring us a sense of closure, [opens faucet] Sometimes comfort. If left untamed, or brains have the ability to wish our lost loved ones back to life. Spirits exist only in the mind.

You ready? - This is the one. - Thank you for agreeing to see us, Mr. Hargraves. - I see you have a new client, Ms. Rose. - The most talented I've ever represented. - Mason, Mason Richardson. It's a real pleasure to meet you at last. - Yes. Yes, it is. Please take a seat. - Have you had a chance to read Mason's work? - Yes. - May I ask what your thoughts? - It's a great read, truly. But I'm afraid it's too much of a gamble for us. As you know, sales are down year-on-year. - I do have a revised draft that I'd love to talk to you about some of the changes that we've made. - Look, my mind's made up. - I think passing on this would be a big mistake. This has everything to be a major hit. - Except a known name on the front cover. I can't afford to take another risk on a rookie author. - You know a good book when you see one. Sometimes, that's all it takes. - I'm sorry, Chrissa. - Thank you for your time. [Footsteps[ I appreciate everything you've. This is the end of the road for. - But you can't just give up. I know how much you want this. Let's talk about it over a drin. - I promised Margot I would head back. - Just one quick drink. That's all I'm asking. Please? [Music] - I'm Sarah and I wish contact to my mother. - My name is Barton, and I wish to contact my wife. I lost her many years ago. I just want to know if she's free of pain. - And last but not least... - My name is Margot and I would like to contact my sister, Evie. - And what do you want from her? - Clarity. I want to know if I'm right in thinking that she's been the one visiting me, these past few nights or... - Or you're just losing your marbles. [chuckles] - Please settle down. - Let's see if we can get your answer. Please. We call upon the spirits of our long lost friends and loved ones to connect with us here today. Spirits, let us know you can hear us. Give us a sign. A spirit is with us. Spirit, reveal who in attendance you wih to contact. [Clicking sound] What was your wife's name? - Jessica. - Jessica? Your husband, Barton, wishes for a sign that you are no longer in pain. Please. She wishes to speak to you. - How? [Clicking sound] Oh. [Eerie music] [Thump] [Scratching sounds] - Barton. - Jess? - Oh Jess, I need to know... - To know what? - How long should I let this charade continue? [laughs] Show's over folks. And that is all that it is. A show, Barton. Barton Bailey. Mmm-hmm. [Creak] - Closed your eyes? - Yeah, no surprise is there but the candles on the other hand, are most intriguing. Very good. You have been the victims of an all-too-common con. You are merely putting all your hard-earned cash into the pockets of charlatans, like our friends here, who take great pleasure in lying to your faces. And may I suggest finding other work something more in keeping with your incredible talents? The West End, perhaps. [laughs] - You know, you think you're so high and mighty, but we are giving these people peace. - You are selling them lies. - No different to you than Mr. Bailey, hey. Profiting from deceit, your books are full of lies. You are no less a fraud. [Door closing] [Footsteps] [Birds chirping] - There's no signing autographs. - I'm not interested in any of. - Well, it won't indulge your ghost stories either. You'll be lucky to get a smile. - Sorry to bother you, Mr. Bail. My name is Margot Richardson. I've read your book. I wanted to ask you about my recent encounters. - The supernatural is not founded in logic or reality, but pure fantasy. Whatever is plaguing you will become clear soon enough. - But things are happening to me that I can't explain in any other way. - I need someone with your expertise. - [chuckles] My expertise? - The ghost hunter. - I was once a paranormal investigator but now, I have turned my attention to more worthwhile endeavors, exposing those who would profit from the weak-minded, like yourself. - I'm desperate. Help me before it's too late. I need to understand what's happening to me. You're the only one. - What do you mean too late? - I'm in danger of being sent a. [Footsteps] - If you truly want answers, may I suggest you try reading my book again. And this time, with your brain engaged. [footsteps] - I warned you about him. Give it a couple of days. If you're still adamant, see us at this address. I might be persuaded to run a few tests for the right price. I wouldn't count on it though. My dad's pretty stubborn. - Thank you. - Charlie. - Charlie. Does my story sound crazy to yo? - Not exactly. [music] - Where are you, Mason? [music] [music] [music] [music] [Eerie soun} [Paper rustling] [Footsteps] - I told you to stop wearing that horrible thing. - I need to have it. - Why? - The neighbors called me names again. - I'll have a word with their parents. - Why do they hate me? They're nice to Margot. - They don't hate you. They're just ignorant. If these girls don't see how wonderfully kind, thoughtful, and funny you are then Evie, they're not deserving of your friendship. You don't need anyone who treats you differently, and who doesn't see what's in h. No matter what, you will always have your sister and I. - After one of the shortest murder trials in recent history, Knightley admitted all the charges against him and entered no defense. Butler points finger at abusive Nancy. - How can you treat Evie this w? - How dare you speak to me like that? We pay you. - You have never paid me a penny, Miss. May I remind you that I was here long before you arrived and will remain long after you've gone. How can you treat them both with such contempt? - They are a constant reminder. A reminder of what James will never give me. All I've ever asked of him were children of my own. - You knew that was never an op. - How can I be asked to love another woman's children? I tried. Douglas, I really tried but I can't do it. I will never love them. They will forever be what stands in the way of what I truly want. My family. I had a dream last night. I drowned them both in the rive. Scariest part was, it was far from a nightmare. [Papers rustling] Apparently Butler Douglas Morrison told police last night how Nancy Jones, girlfriend of the accused, Sir James Knightley would often relish any opportunity to punish Evie for reasons beyond logic. He recalled out each lash of her belt was made with a smile, would often lock her in the basement for days on end whilst their father was away on business. I have reason to believe Sir James Knightley is covering for his beloved manipulative Na. He said. [Creaking] [Eerie music] [Breathing heavily] [Eerie music] Was it Nancy, Evie? [Scream] [Gasp] [Gasp] [Breathing heavily] - I assume you've not told Margot about us yet. - I'm waiting for the right tim. - There is no right time to tell your wife you're leaving her. - What am I going to do? Every publisher in town has turned me down. - It's not your fault. They can't see great work when it's put in front of them. - The quality doesn't matter. No one's willing to take a bet on me. - Why don't we start our own publishing company? Stop chasing the approval of these tasteless fools and put the books in the readers hands ourselves. - How would we do that? - Well, I have the connections. We just lack printing investment We would need significant investment. - I think I can get hold of the money. I just need time. - This could be the start to a new life. Just you and I, Creating the future we've always wanted together. [laughs] [knocks] - Evie? [Footsteps] [Eerie sound] [Gasp] I need to know who, Evie. Dad's innocent, isn't he? Who did this to you? I know. I know you want me to know the truth. [Eerie sound] [Footsteps] [Footsteps] [Screams] Go! - Margot! Margot! [Breathes heavily] [Footsteps] Are you going to tell me what happened tonight? I can't help you if you won't talk to me. - You won't believe me. - Your visions are getting out of control. - They aren't visions, Mason. This is real. - None of this is real. Margot! - How do you explain this? It was Evie. [Chuckles] - Margot. - I saw her in the attic and then I saw her down here. - No, you didn't. - Look what she did to me. - Enough! Look, I've tried being patient with you but... But what? When I was in London, I made a call to Dr. Lake. - Tell me you're lying. - I'm so worried about you. - What have you told her? - I've told her everything. - You don't understand. They will stop me from coming home. They'll lock me up. Why would you do that? - Because you need help. [Footsteps] [Footsteps] [Keys rustling] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Laughs] - Where are you going? - I have another book meeting lined up. - You never said anything about another book meeting. [Door closes] [Birds chirping] [Footsteps] [Knocking] [Knocking] - Morning. - I need to speak to Barton. [Footstep] - To what do I owe the pleasure of your visit? He hasn't had his morning coffet - I feel like I'm losing my min. - I know the feeling. - I didn't come here to be mock. - I can offer you little else. - I can't do this alone. Not anymore. - Do you know how many times I have had this very conversation? How many lonely wives, widowers with overactive imaginations have stepped through that door, desperate to understand the bumps in the night? Mmm? Care to try a guess? Charlie? - Well, we've investigated over 200 cases of suspected supernatural activity. - And what conclusive evidence did we find to support their suspicions? - Nothing. - Nothing. The media has eroded the minds of an entire nation. We're all scared, paranoid, and seeing things that just aren't there. Rest assured, whatever it is that's keeping you awake at night, it is no spirit. - One night, that's all I'm asking for. - Mrs. Richardson... - Please, you'll never see me a. I swear. [Keys rustling] - Load her up. - What's wrong? - Nothing. This house just looks familiar. - So, what can you tell us about this supernatural presence, Mrs. Richardson? - I've seen a little girl. My sister, Evie. Every time I've seen her, it's been at 9 minutes past 9 on the dot. Exact time she died, I believe. - And she died on these grounds? - Evie was murdered, Mr. Bailey. - This is the Knightley murder house, isn't it? - I'm sorry for your loss. Your father got what he deserve. Mrs. Richardson, what's the mat? Nothing. Nothing at all. [Footsteps] - It was my belief the spirits only show themselves to those they wish to be seen by which makes our lives rather tricky. Fortunately, we've got plenty of other ways of detecting supernatural activity. - Disbelief. Where did it come from? I lost my mother when I was very young. Too young. But growing up, she'd visit me when I needed her the most. - You've seen her. - He thinks I'm crazy for saying so, but I still see her. Sometimes. I've seen enough to know that those that died in great pain, like my mother or Evie, remain with us somehow. It's as if their life's work is incomplete. They still have a purpose, or reason to communicate with u. [Music] [Bell rings] [Click] [Ticking] Boom, boom, boom, boom. - Showtime. [Deep sigh] [Match strike] [Glass shatters] [Glass shatters] [Eerie sound] [Beeping] [Clicking] Hey it's me. [Static sound] [Screams] [Eerie music] You alright? [Music] - Your sister is so weird. A tea party? - What happened to her face? - Leave her alone. - Oh, touchy, touchy Margot. - You said you didn't get along with your sister, why do you keep on defending he? - I don't want to make fun of h. - Does she just play all day, ever day by herself? - Stop. - She can't have any friends, can she? - Who would want to be friends with someone who looks like that? - She's a freak. - I said stop! [Heavy breathing] - It's alright, it's alright, it's alright. Look at me, it's me. [Gasps] It's me. Are you alright, Margot? - Have you ever heard sounds like that before? You believe me now, don't you? - I always have. But no doubt my father is conjuring up a logical explanation as we speak. [Creaking] - How can he be so blind? - Somewhere along the line, I realized that proving the existence of the supernatural would discredit his life's work. His books, written to reassure people that they had nothing to fear about their homes being haunted, continue to sell in their thous. Desperate people, they don't think twice about throwing money around in the search for peace of mind. He has nothing to gain from proving the truth. But everything to lose. [Creaking door] [Sheet rustling] Dad! [Music] What's happening? [Music] [Thud] - Margot. What's going on? Who are you? What are you doing here? - Don't worry, we're leaving. - You're going to tell me what's going on here. - What's the point? - Tell me! - I hired them to prove that we're not alone here. [Laughs] - You've actually lost it this time, haven't you? - If someone had to believe me, it was never going to be you. - You are seeing things again. - You're starting to sound like a broken record. - We all know it. What do you expect me to say? - I expect you to believe me, to stand by me no matter what. What! - You're insane! You're truly insane! God! Listen to yourself. Mimi is gone. She's long gone. She's not here. - You're wrong. Well then where is she then? Hm? Where is she? - She's looking right at you. [Eerie sound] - Over here? Over here? - Mason, please... No! - No, well then, where is she n? - I don't know. - Well, let's find her then shall we? Evie! Evie! Evie! Come out come out wherever you. God! What do I have to do to convince you you are sick, Margot! We're alone. We are completely alone! I can't take this any longer. - Well, go then. - Oh, I'm going. - Go back to. You don't think I know what you've been doing? You promise. You promised you wouldn't do it again and I believed you. Whatever this is, whatever this has become, it's over. I want a divorce. - This time, I'm going to make sure they throw away the key. [Keys rustling] [Door opening] [Car door shutting] [Car starting] [Engine sound] Are you alright? [Eerie sound] [Footsteps] [Gasping] [Blood splatter] [Crickets] [Static sound] [Writing] [Writing] - This is undeniable. Look, look this is gonna change everything. - Delete the audio file. We... Do it! - You knew this day was coming. Margot was right. She hired you to find out the t. - Margo didn't hire me. - And who did? [Pouring wine] - I want you to visit the house. Indulge her little ghost hunt. And then, when she's proven wrong, I want a written letter, expressing your concern about her mental state. - I'm starting to think that it is you that needs professional help. - My wife is hiding money from me, a lot of money. Mmm-hmm. - Lock her up in the nuthouse. It all passes over to you. - I can't let it just sit there any longer. In exchange for your help, I'm willing to see that you get your fair share. Name your price. - You're being paid to say that she's crazy? But you've proved she's anything but. - You'll get your cut. - Keep it. I don't want any part of this. You know, you started this to know the truth, once and for all. Because you wanted to help those who had lost their loved ones like us. Tell fact from fiction. To help them. That's just a distant memory no. Your lies pay much better, don't they, dad? What have you become? [Door slamming] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Breathes heavily] [Knocking] [Breathes heavily] [Knocks] [Door opening] [Static sound] - I told you. I told all of you. - I can't let you stay here any longer, for your own safety. - She isn't attached to the hou. She's attached to me. How do I end this? - I'm not convinced we can, not until she gets what she wants. - She wants me to know the trut. I'm getting close. - I fear her true intentions. Howard is the most sinister. - What's that? Your defence. [Music] Holy water? - We must cleanse this place. [Wind] [Creaking] [Thunder] Come on Barton. [loud bang] No, no, no, no, no.

[Groaning] Why are you doing this? What do you want from me! [Door opening] [Music] Now that I've got your attention. You want me to play with someone who looks like tha? [Intense music] [Intense music] - This is why you always have no friends, just like your sister. You're no fun, Margot. - I can be. - Prove it. - How? [Music] Watch this. [music] [music] Evie, we've been thinking, would like to play a game with us? Perhaps, hide and seek? [Music] [Music] [Music] [Footsteps] - 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. [Door opening] - Hide in there. [Door creaking] Trust me. You want to win the game, don't? [Door slamming] [Chuckle] [Laughter] - Let me out. - Perhaps I will, perhaps I won. [Banging] - I can't breathe. You need to be louder than that. - I can't hear you. [laughs] [knocks] [laughter] [Coughing] [Intense music] [Crying] [Clock ringing] Evie? [Door unlocking] [Thud] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Thunder] I didn't mean to hurt her. What's going to happen to me? - Nothing. I won't let anything happen to. Listen to me. No one must ever find out about this. From now on, we, we don't talk about it. It never happened. I'll take care of this. [Intense music] This isn't happening - This isn't real. This isn't real. This isn't real. This isn't real. [Intense music] [Music] - But it was real, wasn't it? I remember. You died because, because of me. [thunder] I'm sorry, Evie. I'm so, so sorry. For everything. But I'm not coming with you. [screams] [Scream] [Screamig] [Music] [Laughing] - Margot!
