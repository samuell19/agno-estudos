Listen, Luffy. We have to live without leaving any regrets. Uh-huh. We gotta go out to sea someday... ...and live as we like. Freer than anyone else. Ace, we're coming to rescue you! Luffy! Activate the encircling walls! What is that?! --We're enclosed! --What the hell is this?! Hey, what's wrong?! It should be fully activated! The wall can't lift the giant body of Oars! We can't close it but do it, Akainu! Meteor Volcano! Now let's move on to... ...the execution of Portgas D. Ace immediately! Ace! --Straw boy! --Honestly! You're too reckless! I need you to do me a favor! Little Oars Jr.! Ace-kun He's still alive?! I'm gonna get Ace back!! You're not good enough to reach this stage yet. Gum-Gum... ...Stamp Gatling! You're too slow! I don't remember saying that that was all of our ships! Another coated ship is entering the bay! Sink it! No! Not the boat! Shoot at Oars! Get ready, everybody! --He pulled the boat out of water! --They broke the encircling walls! Whitebeard has descended to the plaza! Oars... Guys! Rescue Ace and... ...destroy the Navy!! --Garp. --Yeah. Ace! I'll be there soon! --You just run straight! --Alright! --Inazuma! --Okay, Ivan-san That's... --Crab-chan Inazuma of the Revolutionaries army! Luffy! I'm here, Ace! Luffy! I consider you my enemy! Garp! Ace! Luffy! You... Wait! You can't get away from me! What is that?! Sanare you here?! Gum-Gum... ...Giant Balloon! Candle Wall! I'll make the key! Uncuff him right away! Alright! --Fire! --Blow them away! Captain Buggy! There's Brother 3! What?! You've always been like this! Luffy! You've never even listened to me... ...and always done such crazy things! Ace! Ace... I'm sorry, Luffy... Ace, you need to get treated right away! I couldn't make it all the way. I'm sorry. What are you saying? Don't be ridiculous! How could we let that happen?! I couldn't have more regret about it! How annoying! Hurry! Give him first aid now! It's no use. I can tell that my life is ending. So, listen to me, Luffy. Ace... Listen to what I'm about to say. Could you tell it to everybody afterwards? Pops! Everybody! And you Luffy. Thank you... ...for loving someone like me who is good for nothing and who has such bad blood in his veins... ...up to today. Thank you! Did you have a bad dream? You're all sweaty. Drink this. THE 15TH ANNIVERSARY SPECIAL EPISODEE TO HIS FRIENDS After losing his brother Ace during the War of the Best in Marineford, Monkey D. Luffy was deeply wounded both mentally and physically. Don't just think about the ones you've lost! You can't get back what you've lost! What is it that you still have?! I have a suggestion for you. Of course it's up to you to... ...do it or not. A DESERT ISLAND NORTH WEST OF THE MAIDEN ISLAND - LUSCAINA Accepting Rayleigh's suggestion, he came to Luscaina. It's the power to feel other's presence more strongly. It's called Observation Haki! Next, the Armament Haki. This power is the same as wearing invisible armor. And watch this. That was the power to intimidate your enemy! Conqueror's Haki! To obtain the power called Haki, the only effective countermove against Devil Fruit eaters, Luffy is now undertaking a two-year training course. The pirate - Straw Hat Luffy will be... ...on hiatus for a while. Are you okay now? Yeah. I wonder what they're doing. Your friends? Yeah. Think about it! What is it that you still have?! I still have my friends! Zoro. I have an ambition. To be the world's greatest swordsman! I will... ...not be defeated ever again! Until the day I defeat him and become a master swordsman... I'll never... be defeated! Got any problems with that, King of the Pirates?! Usopp. Usopp! I'm captain of the Usopp Pirates... ...and a brave warrior of the sea! I won't let you lay a finger on the village! --Get on already. --Eh?! We're friends now, aren't we? I... I get to be captain, right?! Nami. Luffy... Help me... Of course I will! Luffy! Nami! You're my friend! Yeah! Sanji. Say... do you know the All Blue? I'll come along on your journey to become "King of the Pirates"! We both have foolish dreams. In order to achieve my goal, I'll be the cook for your ship. Owner Zeff!! Thank you for all the damn things you've done for me over all these years!! Chopper. Even if I don't have friends, I can still fight! You do have friends! I am your friend! It's true... that I wanna be a pirate but... I can't become your friend! Shut up! Let's go! Robin. Let me stay on this ship. The pirates waged war on the World Government! Robin! Say that you wanna live!! I... ...wanna live!! Franky. If you want these shorts back, you'll have to join us! Don't be so cocky. I feel sorry for the ship when it's this great but has no real shipwright on the crew. I suppose I can take care of it for you. I, Franky, will... ...take on the role of the shipwright for your crew! I'm taking off for a while! Brook. I'm so happy to hear that Laboon is well and still waiting. My shadow is back. We're out of the demonic sea. It was tough everyday. Truthfully, I didn't even see a glimpse of hope. But Luffy-san I'm so happy to be alive! Can I join your crew? Yes, you can. What?! So easily... ...He joined! I want to become stronger and protect them. I wanna be the man who can protect their dreams. I guess your friends are thinking the same thing and biding their time now. Uh-huh. The sun will rise soon. Get some sleep. It's gonna be another hard training day. Yeah, I'm going back to sleep. You bastard! Gum-Gum... ...Pistol! There's Haki! Where did the gorilla go? Gotta take care of this one first. Second... ...Gear! Jet... ...Pistol! Nailed it?! A rabbit?! Ow, ow, ow! You damn rabbit! It got you! That was a Toughness Rabbit. They can withstand blows. Dammit! That jerk! Now you can use the Armament Haki as you like at a 50 percent chance. With your Observation Haki, you should sense not only your enemy's presence but also how strong they are. You have good eyes so you can't help relying on them. What? All right. I can't see! Leave it on like that for a while. I can't see anything! Like I told you, you have to strain all your senses. You have to feel it. No matter how good your eyes are, you can't see things that move at the velocity of speed or light. But once you obtain the Observation Haki, you can tell where they are. Alright! I'll do it! It's coming! Byojack, how many minutes have passed since we started attacking? Um... eight minutes. So slow! It shouldn't take that long to sink three warships and a liner! B-But it took so much trouble for us to recruit those crew members while you were gone! Making up the number is not good enough! Nightin, Gairam, Sebastian. Show them how you do it. I'll give you one minute! Okay! I've been itching to fight! Let's go already! Who are they?! They're sliding on the water! Fire! How do they do that?! They all look nice and young! But I'm gonna kick their asses anyway! Screw you! Kampo Kempo: Antidote Granule! I always thought these Navy ships were ugly. Let me renovate it for you! Cube Break! Don't take too long! I knew they could do it. I'll take care of the rest. What? In 50 seconds! H-Hey! --Y-You're... --Byrnndi World! Let me borrow these! More-More Hundredfold Gun! How could you do that to my comrades! Go to hell! What?! Look up! More-More Hundredfold Chop! That's my World! His strength hasn't faded at all! That's for sure. --Overwhelmingly strong! --He's crazy! He even blew up his own people! --What's my time? --E-Exactly 50 seconds. Newcomers! Just remember this! If you fail to follow my orders, that's what happens to you! They were all fighting hard following your orders! They were taking too much time! When I ask you to do something by a certain time, you can't be late! If you can't do it, I'll kill you with my own hands! I don't need you here if you're not ready to fight and die for me! Just go away! World! He's insane! By the way, I'll also kill the ones who... ...try to get away! World... SEVERAL DAYS LATER IN AMAZON LILY Severe winter is coming to Luscaina next week! KUJA CASTLE It's gonna be extremely cold. Almost below 40 degrees! He needs some warm clothing! A sweater, a scarf, gloves, and earmuffs! Oh yeah, long underwear, too! "Long underwear." And he's just eating wild beast meat - that's not healthy! He needs some sea food, vegetables, fruit, rice and bread! Does he like pasta? It seemed like he liked Penne Gorgonzola with Sea King meat. Cook a big potful of it, then! Cook it on the ship and deliver him while it's hot! "A big potful... While it's hot." Okay. What else? What? Snake Princess-samaa promise with Rayleigh! Luffy is in the middle of training! It's not good for him if you spoil him! Repress your desire to see him and keep wishing for his success in your heart! That's what a good woman does! Speaking from my numerous experiences with men, men don't like a meddlesome woman like you! You're a Warlord! Stop being crazy about a guy... I know! That's why I'm sending someone so I'm not gonna bother Luffy! Stop getting on my back like that! Princess-sama After a week of severe winter, spring will come along! Get some spring outfits that suit Luffy! "Spring outfits with lace frills." Let's set off as soon as you got it all! Yes, ma'am! How could you do that to an elderly person! Is it a Carrier Bat? It's from the World Government. Wh-What?! I-It's a big deal, Snake Princess! The World Government is summoning the Seven Warlords! Are you listening, Snake Princess?! Oh, Luffy! It feels like my heart's gonna explode when I think of you! I'm gonna send my love to you soon! My dear Luffy! I can't believe you really built it, Gairam! --No way! --With just a single shot, it destroyed the island! Well, it was nothing! I'd been trusting that you'd return for 30 years! So did we! Sebastian and I put all our efforts into getting materials to build the ship! Don't try to take all the credit! She's right! What did you say?! Stop fighting. Thank you all! The ship that we were dreaming about, 30 years ago. We finally got it! And this giant cannon. The barrel is already pretty big but with my More-More power, I can make balls 100 times bigger! With this, we can even blow up Mariejois, the capital of the World Government in an instant! It's all set! Now, it's showtime! World, I don't think we can carry out the plan so easily. What? Because of what we did the other day, the World Government now knows the former great pirate Byrnndi World is back. I wanted to let them know that. It's not a big deal. But they're looking out for our attack and... ...they summoned the Seven Warlords. Is that true?! The Seven Warlords? What the hell is that? Oh yeah! You've been locked up in Impel Down for 30 years so you don't know it. The Seven Warlords are the group of pirates who are sanctioned and granted amnesty by the Government. In return for that, they can be summoned when an emergency arises, as "Government's dogs." But they're not just "dogs" - their strength is unquestionable. And? I'm good at collecting information. They were summoned this morning so they're gonna come to the Government HQ within a few days. I don't think your plan's gonna work out... Wait a minute. Did you say they were summoned this morning? Yes. Is that important? Then, let's take advantage of this. What do you mean? Which Government's dog lives closest to here? Damn! That gorilla and that alligator and that lion! I'm gonna do it again after I eat! Going back into the forest? Yeah! I kept getting beaten by them! I'm gonna kick their asses this time! I see. Don't die. Yeah! Where did they go? Sleeping? Hey! Gorilla! Alligator! Lion! Fight me openly and squarely! What's this smell? It smells so good! What's there? Th-This must be food! I thought so! Can I eat this?! Let's eat! Luffy's here. Yeah, he looks fine. Oh, Luffy's there?! Look at that reaction just by hearing about him. She would've had a heart attack if she had landed with them. Luffy! He still has a big appetite! He even ate the spring outfits with frills! Big Sis, Luffy even ate the... What did he eat? Where is the Empress of Amazon Lily? Who are you?! My name is Byrnndi World! I'm here to kidnap the World Government's dog - the Warlord, Boa Hancock! B-Byrnndi World?! You know who that is?! How many times do I have to tell you! On the letter of request from the World Government, that you tore up and threw away, there was a name of the man who was the reason that they summoned the Warlords. And that was Byrnndi World! What?! Kidnap Princess-sama Snake Princess-sama Hey. W-Well, I didn't say "She's here"! I saw the Kuja's pirate ship on the shore so I said "Maybe." All I said was "Maybe, she's here." What a waste of time. Wait! I can't just let someone who came to kidnap Big Sis, walk away... ...because I'm her sister! Her sister? Sonia! Mari! What's going on there? You hear me?! Say something! I see! The Empress is on the other side of the Snail! Well then... More-More Tenfold Shotgun! How dare you do that to Marigold-sama What? Oh, you girls! Did you bring all this food for me?! Luffy, run! What's wrong?! Did you get attacked by the beasts?! Who is he? Who are you? I have no business with you all. Go to hell! Don't do it! Ouch. What do you think you're doing? Drop dead! More-More Hundredfold Gun! It's not gonna... Luffy! Luffy! You're the Empress of Amazon Lily, aren't you? How's Luffy?! Is he okay?! She must be talking about that kid. Come and see yourself! I'll leave a Vivre Card here. Pirate Empress! If you want your sisters back, track me down with the Card before the break of dawn, the day after tomorrow! --What are you... --Clank. I've heard of a kid named Luffy somewhere... Luffy, are you all right? Hancock. Why are you two here? I'm glad that you woke up finally! Ow, ow, ow... Don't try to get up. Stay still. Oh yeah! What about those girls?! Margaret and the others got treated and are sleeping. Sonia and Mari are... They got taken away, didn't they? Uh-huh. Damn, that bastard! I think the World guy wants something from me. Are you gonna go take them back? Of course! But if he's really the notorious World, even as strong as you are, it's too... I'll go with her! Hancock! You have to take me with you! Luffy! Luffy, don't you remember that you promised me that you were gonna train yourself here for two years. No, I remember that! And you haven't master the Haki completely yet. You're gonna die if you go! I'm not gonna lose this time! What have you been training yourself for? If you go, you may not be able to see your friends again! But they came here to deliver food for me! And they're kidnapped! I can't just sit still doing nothing! Luffy... Rayleigh, please let me take him with me! I won't let them kill him! No matter what I say, I can't change your mind, can I? Come back alive at any price! I will! But you have to be careful. As you may know, people are looking all over for you right now. Don't cause any trouble in a place where you may attract public attention. I got it! THE DESTROYER OF THE WORLD BYRNNDI WORLD APPEARED?! This guy is like a mad dog. The World Nobles, pirates, the Navy... He's killing everyone that he sees. AN ISLAND VANISHED OVERNIGHT Did he do this, too? That's what the Gov't thinks. They made a decision to summon the Warlords quickly after the World Noble case. They've already sent out Carrier Bats three days ago. Without even telling us! It's necessary. Tsuru-san By summoning the Warlords, they wanted not only to prepare for World's attack but also to prevent any one of the Warlords from allying with World by having them close at hand. I think that's how you should look at it. Until that day 30 years ago, he had been feared as the "Destroyer of the World." The Government did what they did because they see him as a threat. "Destroyer of the World"? Uh-huh. World would take out everything that he sees. He was dangerous for not only everyday people but also for other pirates. So the Government secretly assembled people who carried a grudge against him 30 years ago, and executed a plan to take World down in collaboration with the Navy. That was when you guys were still rookies. Do you remember it? Yeah, I think so. The allied forces of the Navy and the pirates were cornered and they almost had to retreat after an intensive battle against World. But things had turned around thanks to the spies that the Government had sent in, besides our efforts. The World Pirates were taken down. Why has he returned now, then? I have no idea. I heard a rumor once that he had been locked up at Impel Down, frozen and sleeping. Sengoku-san there were some prisoners who snuck out of Impel Down... ...besides the four prisoners that Blackbeard took away from Level 6. And World was on that list. He's the last person you want to be out of prison. On top of that, we're relocating the Navy HQ and making the transition to the new system. It's the worst possible time. He's a More-More Fruit eater. He can make things 100 times bigger and faster and channel that into an attack. People don't call him the "Destroyer of the World" for nothing. Based on information about his campaign of terror, he's ratting around this area for sure. Get some warships ready! There you are. World. Do you really want to go to Marineford? Worried? There is nothing to be worried about. That's why we need the Empress. She's been summoned by the Government and if we can hold her as a hostage, we can get to Marineford easily. And once we get there, we can fire the giant cannon... ...right at Mariejois, the capital of the World Government! Picture it in your mind. Mariejois blowing up. The Navy soldiers will be freaked out! It's gonna be great! I'm opposed to this plan! Opposed? I thought that we wanted that cannon and this ship so we could be free! That's why we're gonna use it against the Government! Because they arele's freedom! Maybe, but... All you guys have to do is just shut up and do as I say! You must follow my order! Even if you're my big brother, I'm not gonna go easy on you if you disobey me! Captain! It's Kuja's ship! It's coming towards us! Here they come! Let's do it, Big Bro! This is where the Card was leading us but... I don't see a thing. What's this noise? What the hell?! Is that an island?! It's coming out of the water! It's big! Thank you for coming all the way, Empress of Amazon Lily! Your sisters are here! Big Sis! Big Sis, I'm sorry! --Sonia! Mari! --We'll get you out soon! That kid is here, too. He's quite tough. That's for sure. If you want them back, come on board! You're always welcome! Yeah, right! Evasive maneuvers! Hancock! Get closer already! I know! Do they think they can get away? I'll take care of it! Gum-Gum Balloon! He is a Devil Fruit eater, isn't he? Give me some bullets! More-More Fiftyfold Cannon! Armament Haki! Luffy! Don't! Let go of me! I won't let him die! Salome! You have to calm down, Snake Princess! You're a Devil Fruit eater, too! If you dive into the water, you'll drown as well! Luffy! Empress! If you don't wanna die, give yourself up and come with them! How dare you do that to my beloved man and talk to me like that! Guys, you can just kill her! Wait, World! I thought we were gonna hold her as a hostage! We can just nail her dead body on a pole and head to Marineford. Kill her! Love-Love Beam! What? That's the Kuja's power to turn people to stone! Luffy! Oh, I'm glad that you're okay! Yeah, sorry! I dropped my guard! The name "Luffy" reminds me of Straw Hat but... The name "Luffy" reminds me of Straw Hat but... --Great! I guess she wants to be killed by me. --Ring, ring, ring... Clank. Don't bother. I'll take care of them. Sebastian. Can you do it in five minutes? Two minutes is enough for me. You ready? Yeah! Luffy! Let's get inside from there! Great Water Shot! You wanna go see our captain, don't you? Let me lead you... to hell! Get out of our way! Just turn to stone! Love-Love Beam! Why is it not working against him?! Am I not attractive to him?! I'm sorry! I'm blind so... ...your attractiveness means nothing to me! What about this?! Gum-Gum... ...Jet Pistol! Not bad! He's quite tough! Let me return the favor! Hey, that's an island, isn't it? Hold on... No, that's a big ship! No way! And something's going crazy! Is it a Giant? It's a Fish-Giant which is a crossbreed species between a Giant and a Fish-Man. --Oh, it's a fight! --Let me see! Get out of my way! Somebody's fighting? Today's the special day that I Buggy-sama Who's fighting?! That Jolly Roger is... I-I-It's no good! It's the World Pirates! They're the reason that the Warlords were summoned! What?! N-No way! That's too much to be a coincidence... What a coincidence! On top of that, the Fish-Giant is fighting against... ...Straw Hat Luffy and the Pirate Empress - Boa Hancock! Straw Hat? Why is he here?! --Captain Buggy! --This is your chance! Since our jailbreaking friend from Impel Down, Straw Hat, and your fellow Warlord, the Snake Princess, are here, we can bring down World here and take him as a present! Yeah, if you can take out World, the Navy and the Government will think highly of you! You're gonna be a star! --A star? --It's not gonna be that easy. Wait. I don't know why Straw Hat is fighting against World but... ...the Navy is looking for him! Even if he takes down World, he can't stay here for long. What about letting them take down World and we take all the credit for that? It's a big chance! Wait a sec! We don't know if those two are gonna win! That's right! Guys! Let the Navy know that we Buggy Pirates are fighting against the World Pirates now! Oh! Captain Buggy is going for it! What are you up to? Okay, listen. Once they know that the "Destroyer of the World" and I, a Warlord, are engaging a war here, people like the admirals will come! I see! If the things go wrong, we can just run away leaving the rest to the Navy! Right! Luckily, it's not too far from Marineford. They're gonna be here right away! Then, we can just sit back and watch. Straw Hat! Good luck fighting for my credit! --Did he run?! --No! Great Shark Arrows! Luffy! You bastard! Perfume Femur! Camouflage Air! What?! Whoa-whoa! Straw Hat's gonna lose soon if nothing is done! That's not good! Hancock! I'm fine! Well done spotting me while I was camouflaging myself! But this is it! Go to hell! Spin Tornado! Third Gear! Gum-Gum... ...Giant Pistol! Sebastian, you disappoint me! Luffy! Let's go, Hancock! O-Okay, honey! You've got to be kidding! Gairam. Lead me to them. Roger that. Why don't you keep an eye on the hostages? World! Wait! I can't let you walk away! You're kind of cute! Why don't you work under me? Negative Extra Big Hollow! I-I wish I'd been born a cross between an ameba and a water flea... You're gross. Don't want you. Luffy! You're... No! Straw Hat! Wh-Who is she? Do you know her?! Um... I don't remember who she is... But thank you for helping us! Y-You have no reason to thank me! It was just a coincidence. He said he was gonna go somewhere so I just came along to kill time. So I wasn't thinking about helping you... Where did they go? That girl called him "Straw Hat." I thought so! What's wrong with this ship?! The floor crumbled! Luffy, who was that girl? That flying girl! Oh! She is... um... I think I met her before but what was her name? He's trying to fool me! I-Is this what they call "cheating"?! Which way should we go? Who's that girl? Where did she come from... What?! Hey, hey! What is he doing here?! How do I know? Maybe he was summoned by the World Government, too! Maybe, he's up to get the credit for taking Byrnndi World down before anybody, like us! That means he's gonna ruin all of our plans! Well, he's a very faithful guy so I'm sure that's what he's here for! That stupid shithead! Why does he wanna do such an unnecessary thing?! Then, we have to leave our traces somewhere at any cost! Traces? Traces! Oh yeah! Guys! Now we got some strong backup! It's time to fight! Let's charge! Yeah! Hey, Straw Hat was there. What's going on? I have no idea. What the hell?! It's like a maze! Oh, it's an open space! But what is this place? We don't know which way to go anyway. Luffy, let's go this way! Okay! Luffy! What happened?! Are you okay, Luffy?! I almost killed the Empress. Hancock, you can just go ahead! --But... --Just go! Okay. Please be careful, Luffy! Yeah, I got it! World, be careful! You better not underestimate that kid! He's the pirate who made a raid on Marineford to rescue his brother Portgas D. Ace, and raised havoc! He is Monkey D. Luffy! Monkey D.? Don't you remember? He's a grandson of Garp who works for the Navy! That old man with the fists?! But the Navy Headquarters fell into confusion because of a brat like this? And... did you get to save your brother? I thought so! You're not strong enough to save anybody... Shut up! Gum-Gum Gatling! Second... ...gear! Jet Gatling! You're not dead yet? S-Stop. He is World, isn't he? This is the weapon storage. I'll give you a chance. Swords. Spears, guns, batons... Use whatever you want. Maybe you can beat me, then. I don't need it! What stupid pride. I don't need... ...any weapon! Jet Pistol! There's Haki! Don't push your luck! You can't even control your Haki! You couldn't even save your own brother because you're too weak! I'm gonna teach you that you can never keep up with my speed! More-More Tenfold Speed! I don't know why you came along with the Empress but... ...let me tell you something. You're not strong enough to save anybody! That Empress, next. Straw Hat! He got beaten so easily! What should we do?! Since he lost so easily, I don't think my plan's gonna work out... Idiots! What are you doing?! Heal him as much as you can and get him back on track! You care about your friend so much! Captain Buggy, I'm gonna follow you for the rest of my life! You guys! For real? Garp's grandson, huh? Garp! Sengoku! Why are you guys doing this?! I'm disappointed in you two! That fool! We shouldn't have let him talk! Maybe he's right. World, what's going on? They joined hands with the pirate alliance to bring us down! What?! I'm sure that the World Government is behind it! What're we gonna do, World? The same as usual! We take out everyone who stands in our way! Right, Sebastian?! Right! It's not gonna be as easy as we expected. We're taking so much damage. Let me go! I'm gonna kick his ass in a one-on-one fight! No need for that. What is Cipher Pol doing here? There will be a sudden change soon. What's going on? Why... Why did they stop shooting?! World! World... What do you think you're doing?! You can't fight the World Government. It's impossible to win! We can't follow you anymore! Th-They told us they won't charge us if we turn you over to them and surrender! Who told you that?! You've been bought off by the Gov't?! N-Not just us! They told us you do, too! Don't tell me you fell for it! World! It has started. Launch an all-out attack! I thought you guys were my friends. You're very strong, Captain. Don't tell me you guys are Cipher Pol! What the hell is that? It's an intelligence agency of the Gov't! You are right. We have spent time with you as your crew members but it was our mission. And it's over. World! World... --Stop! Don't let him get away! --Nightin, Gairam, everybody, run! Byojack... What are you saying? --What about Captain?! --I know. But we're all gonna die for nothing if we stay! I give you an order as sub-captain! Survive! What is he saying? Alright! I'm sorry, Captain! --Stop! --Sebastian! Please! They've gotten away! They're wounded. They're not gonna live long. They've betrayed me. I'm not gonna go through that again! Where is the Empress now? --She'll get to Nightin soon. What's that? Don't you trust me? Okay! Then, I will take her down at any price and bring her to you! Hey, how is he?! He stopped bleeding but... He's saying something! I don't wanna... let them go through that again! I never wanna go through that again! I don't know what you're talking about but if you don't wanna go through it, pull yourself together, Straw Hat! Wake up! Why don't you wake up already?! Shit Hat! You can just go ahead! He risked his life to... ...save me! I'm so ashamed of myself for suspecting him of cheating! I have to keep going for him and my sisters! What's this place? What's this smell? Welcome, Pirate Empress. How disrespectful are you not to give me your name and talk to me with your back to me? I can't believe they made such an immature girl like you a Warlord! The World Government made a poor judgment! I'm a ship doctor of the World Pirates and a Kampo Kempo master - Nightin. I need to go on. Show me the way to my sister. I know a lot about you. Byojack gave me information. I have a strategy to ward off your Love-Love power! I'm not interested in listening to your nonsense. Kampo Kempo Secret Medicine! Fishwort Hell! Love-Love Beam! It's so bitter!! Your power didn't work for me! In this "Fishwort Hell," I blended hundreds of bitter medical herbs! So it's the bitterest kampo medicine in the world! It cleared off wicked desire from my heart. That's why your Love-Love power didn't work! Next, it's this one! Kampo Poison Mist! What's going on? You must be embarrassed and you can't move! And now... Kampo Kempo... ...Secret Medicine! Yes! Oh, yes! Bouncy! Hey! Ginseng Newcomer! I'm 80 years old but with a rejuvenating kampo, I can look like this! Get ready! Kampo Kempo Technique: Kakkon Toe... Toe... Toe, Toe, Toe... Toe-kick! Cordyceps Soul Shot! How do you like it? This is the power of Kampo Kempo which consists of Kampo and Kempo! Slave Arrow! Kampo Dome! How about this, then? Pistol Kiss! No, no! It's no use! People used to call me the "Queen of Kampo Kempo"! I'm as strong and attractive as you! Could you do me a favor? Please shut your bloody mouth. It's bitter! So damn bitter! She's like a goddess or something! What a femme fatale! But... No matter how many times you try, your power won't work on me! Cordyceps Soul Shot... ...Burst! Th-That's not fair! No? Oh no! Oh no! You look pale. It's only natural to be fascinated by me and become tense. You can't resist. The whole world is gonna celebrate if you die here. Because I'm that... ...beautiful! She's looking down on me so much that she's actually looking up! I'm not interested in women at all in the first place! I really love men! Go to hell, Hancock! I'm scared! How sexy! No, no, no, no! Oops! S-She's so beautiful! Love-Love Beam! You were wrong. There's nothing in this world that can block out my beauty. Nightin... Hey! Why don't you wake up already, Straw Hat?! You fool! If you go, you may not be able to see your friends again! Luffy! Luffy! Luffy! Luffy. Luffy! Luffy. Luffy! Luffy-san Come back alive at any price! You're not strong enough to save anybody! Hey! I thought you wanna take down World! Wake up now! Hey! Hey! Hey! Whether or not I can save anybody... I'll never know until I try! Where did he go?! H-He went that way! I'm gonna kick his ass at any cost! Where are you, World?! Are you okay? I-It worked out as I planned. It's obvious he's lying. This way? Huh? How is it possible? That kid... He's still alive. Byojack! Can I take care of him? Gairam. He's already in the trap that I made. Count on me! Taking advantage of this mess, the new Warlord - Buggy the Clown and his clan snuck into the ship, too! Be very careful! I'll finish them all! Gairam... Cube Break! Wh-What's going on?! Damn! This way, maybe? Cube Break! My name is Gairam. I ate the Cube-Cube Fruit and I am a cube human! I can cut anything into a cube! For example... Straw Hat! I'm not gonna let you get to Captain World! Cube... ...Booster! Cube Booster! That was easy. Stay crushed for the rest of your life. I guess it's about time for Shit Hat to finish off World! Stop! What are you guys doing in our ship? We didn't permit you to get on board. He doesn't look so friendly to us! I'm gonna kill you all! Cube Booster! He's a Devil Fruit eater! It's obvious! I thought I was gonna die! --Straw Hat! --What is he still doing here?! I'm so surprised! Why are you still alive?! Because I'm a rubber man! Hey, why are you still wandering around here?! It couldn't be helped! I didn't know which way to go! Didn't you bluster out like you're something in front of me?! Stop whining and just go fight World already! Or my plan will be ruined! --That's my Captain! --What? He treated him and encouraged him and he's now saying "I'll take this one so you go ahead"! --You're a pirate with a heart of gold! --What? How could they interpret it like that? Captain Buggy! I'm so happy to be part of your group! We'll commit ourselves to making your dream come true! Buggy! Buggy! --Hey, what should we do? --Let's just go with the flow. Buggy! Buggy! Wh-What are you gonna do?! Yeah! When I come to think of it, I guess he has a point! Their bounties were higher than mine when we were in Impel Down. But now, they're all working under me. That means I'm one of the great pirates now! I'm not gonna be defeated by a small fry like this guy! Straw Hat! Leave this guy up to me and go beat World! You don't have to worry at all! Since I'm a legendary pirate now, I'm not gonna tell everyone... ...that I saved your ass! Thank me for the rest of your life! Is it okay? Are you trying to make a fool of me?! I said "Go ahead," Shit Hat! Okay! Thank you, Buggy! Hey! The situation hasn't changed a bit! How are you gonna settle this?! What? Really? Are they even strong? Oh, well! I gotta clear out you intruders anyway! I'll show you the true power of the cube human! Air Cube! --What?! --He compressed air?! Air Cube Booster! Candle Wall! Just run! I'll be counting on you! That's nothing! He was just a big talker. --Captain, which way should we go?! --It's a dead end, huh? You have nowhere to run! Cube Break! What?! Captain! It's over! Ha ha! Is that all you got?! You're unbelievable, Captain! You never give up even after you're compressed! How about this?! Cube Booster! You idiot! It's no use! You think so? Totem Cube! Wh-What are you gonna do?! What do you think?! That's what I was gonna do. How do you like being tormented to death?! All right, one more! Still more to go! There you are now! This is it! Chop-Chop Quick Escape! I'm decompressed! He's also a Devil Fruit eater? Come together! My body parts! What are you doing?! I figured, this is what I have to do! What are you gonna do?! Relax. I still have it It Yes. I swore that I'd never use it again. Because it has the power to blow up several towns at once! You guys may get hurt, too. --Oh, you still got that kind of thing?! --That's our Captain Buggy! --Are you talking about Buggy Ball? --Captain, isn't he right? Don't give it away! Oh, isn't that the thing you used for the prison-guard beasts in Impel Down? That's Muggy Ball. It's completely different. But that's what I was gonna use. Anyway, I'll use it and take back my torso and we'll run! Enough with chitchatting! Air Cube! Hit or miss! Blow away! Special Muggy Ball! Wow! I got it! Damn! I can't see a thing! You should not do that on my ship! Perfume Femur! Where did Luffy go?! That way, ma'am. What? He's down on the floor! Captain Buggy did it! No, I think it wasn't him... Forget it. Let's just leave it like that. Uh-huh. Yeah, Long live Captain Buggy! Banzai! Banzai! Banzai! All right, guys! Let's take down World next! Pull your shit together in a flashy way! Yeah! How much longer are you gonna be able to go on like this? I can't believe this! Byojack! How's everything going? How is this happening? They got beaten. Nightin and Gairam. Who let Gairam fight? What are you guys doing behind my back?! Wait a minute! They fought very hard... ...for you! For me? Straw Hat wasn't dead! But we didn't wanna give you any more trouble! But they were so useless after all! What were you thinking?! Now, the Empress is on her way here, isn't she? She is. But... Then I'll take care of the rest. World, I'm sorry! What are you apologizing for? World. This is not what we've ever wanted! What we've dreamed about was... Look, World! This sea is connected to so many islands and countries that we've never seen before! Isn't it cool? Yeah, it is. We gotta set out to... Are you okay, Big Bro? Yeah, I'm okay. Don't worry. Big Bro... World, you gotta set out to the sea someday. There must be adventures beyond our imagination waiting for you out there. You're not gonna come with me? I've been like this? ...ever since I was a little kid so it's impossible.? Don't say that! Do you wanna stay on this small island forever? Travel far and learn about the world and live big for me! Big Bro... I... I wanna set out with you! What? To travel around the world... Are you gonna come with me?! But I'm... It's gonna be okay! I'll protect you! Let's sail out together! World! Don't cry! We're brothers, right? Several years later, we left the island. It was supposed to be an adventurous journey around the world. World, that's enough! You're gonna kill them! We're the Byrnndi brothers! You better watch out next time! Captain! Vice Captain Byojack got... What?! Anyone who stands in our way, whoever it is, we'll kick his ass! We were supposed to be searching for freedom. But we were merely pirates to everyone else. The Navy and the Government placed you on the wanted list eventually and before we knew it people started calling you "Destroyer of the World" and being afraid of you. A submarine? Yes. If we can travel underwater unless there is a need to surface, we can avoid unnecessary battles. Since we have so many crew members, we need a bigger ship. What about weapons? I want a big cannon! A very big one! Why do we need such a thing? If we avoid unnecessary battles, we don't need... Big Bro, you got it backwards. If we put on an insanely big cannon to show off, the people who know about my More-More power will stay away. So we don't have to fight. All right! Count on me! Our dream ship, huh? Which means it symbolizes our freedom! It's just a ship. We had that idea 30 years ago. And we were gonna build this ship - Groseade to pursue it! We built this ship and had been waiting for you not because we wanted to take down the Government! Big Bro, are you still talking about a crap like that? You can just sit there and watch, to the end. Because you're annoying! I'm not gonna be fooled like that again. I'm not the same person I used to be! World! I told you it's a misunderstanding! I know! But I don't care anymore. World! I still do care! Luffy! Are you two okay?! Wait there! I'm gonna get you out! You're such an undisciplined brat! Why can't you stay out of it? Pathetic! They took good care of me once. So I'll save them! And... I can't protect my friends if I allow myself to lose to a weakling like you! Friends? Protect your friends? What are you talking about? You couldn't even save your own brother! But you think you can protect your friends? What a joke?! I'm gonna finish you off in 30 seconds! You can't beat me this time! More-More... ...Tenfold Shotgun! Second Gear! Luffy! Oops, I miscalculated. I only needed 10 seconds. What are you doing? Even if you can move 10 times or more faster, it doesn't matter if I get hold of you! I see. But... More-More Thirtyfold Speed! Jet Pistol! What's wrong? Can't you hit me?! Brat, you should realize that overwhelming speed... ...can generate overwhelming power! Fiftyfold Speed! Furious Hammer! Luffy! It's not working! Because I'm a rubber man! Oh yeah. Third Gear! Giant Pistol! It's not working! Then, what about... this?! Jet Pistol! Even if... ...you can use the Armament Haki... Jet Gatling! It doesn't mean anything... ...if you can't hit a target! Friends? Brother? You can't protect anybody like that! Captain Buggy, this is... Oh yeah! We finally got out of there! I can say goodbye to this gloomy ship now! You're giving away what you're really thinking. Oh no! Dammit! I was gonna take down World with my own hands but I went the wrong way! Captain Buggy, put that aside and look! I-It's a fleet of the Navy ships! What are they all doing here?! Because you told us to call them! Oh, I did, didn't I? Hey! I'm here! The new Warlord - Buggy-sama "Destroyer of the World" - Byrnndi World, is here! Somebody's waving his hands towards us from the deck. Who cares! All ships, start firing! All ships, start firing! What?! What?! This is no good! The Navy is gonna find Luffy! Bring us around to the back now! Roger that. What's going on?! We have a problem, World! A fleet of the Navy ships is here! The Navy?! Hey, don't you think the Navy's trying to sink the ship? Shouldn't we just leave? Great! World? I didn't expect the Navy would come to us! Hey, Byojack! Let's fire it and destroy the Navy ships! Prepare the cannon! That's ridiculous! If you fire it at that short distance, this ship's gonna sink from the impact! I don't care! Hurry up! I thought it was A "symbol of our freedom"? What bullshit! The ship and the cannon are just tools! I don't know what you guys were thinking but my mind was already made up when I broke out of Impel Down. Then you guys came to pick me up with this ship. So I decided to use this ship to carry out my own purpose! It's pretty logical, isn't it? And that purpose is to get revenge against the World Government?! I couldn't care less about what will happen to this ship, let alone you guys! Gairam, Nightin, and Sebastian are our friends, aren't they?! Friends? I've never trusted them nor you from the beginning! I don't need any friends! You're lying! You're not that kind of person... You guys are the same as the ship, just tools to me! World! If you can't follow my orders, I don't need you! Did you say "Friends are tools"? "You don't need any friends"?! Damn you! Screw you!! Luffy! Hancock! Take your sisters! The Pirate Empress? I'm gonna beat the hell out of this guy! Mari! Sonia! Are you okay?! Big Sis! Luffy! Come back to the ship at any cost! I will! I don't need the Warlord as a hostage anymore. I'm gonna fight you as you wish! Praying to God won't help you to defeat me! No, it will! Why are you so sure of that?! I'm not gonna get beaten by a guy... ...who sees his friends as tools! What's wrong with abandoning someone who is useless?! You abandoned your brother, too, didn't you?! What a pain in the ass! You can't protect anybody after all! Your brother nor your friends nor anybody! You're right. I couldn't... ...save Ace's life! But I still have... ...friends who are waiting for me! Enough already! To protect my friends! To become the King of the Pirates! World! I've got to beat you up! He's getting stronger while we're fighting! Gum-Gum... ...Jet Gatling! More-More Hundredfold Speed! Gum-Gum... ...Red Hawk! It's Ace's flare! I made a promise to Rayleigh and Hancock. I can't die here! It's not like the Navy didn't know that we were there, right?! In any case, we need to get away as far as we can! Guys, keep swimming! And you right there! Don't get my legs wet! Aye aye sir! It's a strategic withdrawal! Let's go! Yeah! Luffy! Hurry up and get out! What are you gonna do?! I haven't lost yet. Our friends are beaten and our ship is destroyed. And you're wounded all over. What more can you do?! I'm not gonna be satisfied unless I fire it at them at least once. You're really gonna use it?! I was gonna use it anyway. I'm sorry that I was lying to you guys. But you guys betrayed me once, too. So we're even. You're still holding a grudge as I thought! But that was... I had been sleeping in the ice! It seems like only yesterday to me! I'll never forget. How can I forget about it? World... Where is the exit? A giant cannon emerged from the bow! Meteor Volcano! Now what?! The least I can do now is... land one hit against them! More-More Hundredfold Cannon! Get out of my way! I am Byrnndi World! E-Evacuate! Luffy! Luffy! He hasn't come out yet?! Big Sis! Please calm down! World. This ship is gonna sink in no time. We have lost. Let's start over - just the two of us. Let's go, World. Across the sea. Luffy!! Luffy? Oh no! He's gonna fall into the water! Luffy! Hancock! Luffy! Luffy! I'm glad that you're alive! What's so funny? I don't know. You're weird. What did you want to do after all? I taught you all the basics of Haki. There is nothing more for me to teach you. Rayleigh. I'm thinking about going back to Sabaody. What are you gonna do? I sent out the message one and a half years ago. "3D2Y." It means "two years later instead of three days later," doesn't it? We needed to get stronger to carry on the journey. I'm sure they know it, too. You still have six more months. Yeah! I can't wait to see how they changed after two years and I have to become stronger just like they did. I'm gonna stay here and keep training for six more months. I see. Then, keep improving your Haki power until you can control it as you like. I got it! I'm looking forward to seeing you again. Thank you, Rayleigh! SIX MONTHS LATER It's been two years already. All right! Let's go! Sunny! Sorry to keep you waiting for two years. What an attractive woman before me! You're our super Robin, aren't you?! You haven't changed, Franky! I wanna go to sea. I wanna fish. No, you can't, shithead! Everybody's coming soon so just walk to the ship with me! Usopp! Oh man, you got so big! Doing okay? He's right! You're much softer than before! It's been a long time, Chopper! --Nami? --Yes! Thank you! The timing was perfect! You guys! I've got a lot of things that I want to share with you but in any case, thank you for going along with my selfish decision for two years! That wasn't the first time. He's right! You've always been selfish! Set sail!! Yeah!!
