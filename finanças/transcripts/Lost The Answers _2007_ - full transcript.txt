It's story that began with a simple question. Where are we? But the search for the answer... So what do we do now? was just the beginning. I wanna get off this island more than anything else in the world. We're all in this together, man. A mysterious island... They have houses and dormitories with water and power. A group of strangers... Let's trust this guy. fighting for survival. If we can't live together... This is our island. We're gonna die alone. And seeking redemption. I'm on my own journey now. We've been presented with baffling mysteries... Dad! and extraordinary revelations. I think we found it. But this story is just hitting stride. Kate, damn it, run! So what better time to remember all that we've learned? You can come out! "Lost" producers Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse are here to shed some light... Did I give that away? and provide the final word. That is the definitive answer as to why the plane crashed. Why do you find it so hard to believe? Why do you find it so easy? - So many mysteries... - She's alive. - There were no survivors. - So little time. Charlie, duck! I want some friggin' answers! Lost, The Answers Season 03 Synchro: Golgi, Loky Synchro: Metalmarco, Hutch. Millions of viewers around the world have searched for answers to the many mystery of Lost. Do you wanna know a secret? Tonight we go right to the source. Sometimes you answer a question, but another question crops up as a result of it. So if you reveal that Locke is in a wheelchair, the question then becomes, "how did he get in the wheelchair?" I think it's a lot like life. Mean, you march forward and get answers to certain issues and certain questions in your life, but new ones always arise, and I think that that's what we really try to do on the show. The show never becomes completely vacant of mystery, because it's a mystery show. That's part of the DNA of "Lost," and we embrace it. You'd think they would've come by now. Who? Anyone. The plane crashes. They... They're on this island for many days. No rescue comes. No one shows up. The characters don't know anything about each other. If you were on an airplane, and it crashed, you wouldn't know anything about the guy who was in 16C. So first plane crash? - What gave it away? - I can always spot the newbies. I don't know your name. - I'm Kate. - Jack. The show has been sort of an exploration into these characters' pasts. They're mysterious in addition to the island, and so little things like "what did Kate do?" or "why did Sayid torture somebody?" or "how did Jack get his tattoos?"... Those are mysteries that have been slow going because they don't like to talk about it. We learned that Jack is a doctor. We come to learn that he was a spinal surgeon. We know that Jack had a lot of issues with his father. How many drinks did you have at lunch, dad? We know that his wife was someone who... She had been in a car crash and had a bad spinal injury. It's okay. I know I'm not gonna be dancing anymore. He believes that this is an impossible surgery, and the next day, lo and behold, he pokes Sarah's foot with a pencil and it... and it wiggles. Can you feel this? So he has to believe in some way, that this is his destiny, but then when that marriage begins to come apart at the seams... - Wait a minute. - Maybe... there was purpose behind this. Look at the bright side. Now you have something to fix. He holds himself to a very high standard. He's insecure in many ways, although, at he same time, he's a great hero. Everything's gonna be okay. We're gonna stay here tonight, okay? Together. You did a good thing... Taking care of everybody and... just giving them something to count on. Kate was a fugitive before she came the island. She still is a fugitive. - She is still a fugitive. - Once a fugitive, always a fugitive. A lot in the pilot is made up of these handcuffs that Walt finds, leading to the ultimate reveal that somebody on the plane was a fugitive. We reveal by the end of the pilot that it's Kate. Katherine, what did you do? I took care of you, ma. She actually blew up a house containing her stepfather, and there is a US Marshal who's been chasing her. Kate Austen, you're under arrest for murder. I didn't do anything. Oh, yeah, you did. He's taking her on the plane back to the United States, and that's really where the story begins. If i didn't know any better, I'd say you're worried about me, Jack. If i didn't know any better, I'd say you have a problem staying in one place for very long, Kate. So here she is, stuck on this island, which sort of forces her into very tricky relationships, especially when it comes to Jack and Sawyer. How about you come a little closer? Warm me up? You sure know how to make a girl feel special, Sawyer. Guys, this isn't just a bear. It's a polar bear. The sort of practical questions, we really do try to answer. I mean, right at the beginning of the show, I don't think anyone expected us to meet with the person who send out the mysterious signal. We've got a bar! It's french! The rescue party. It has to be. Please, someone come. The Others... They... They're dead. It's a loop. It's a distress call. It's been playing over and over for 16 years. Guys, where are we? Charlie looked around and realized, you know, this might not be a regular island. He said, you know, "guys, where are we?" I found a wire on the beach. I thought it might have something to do with the transmission we picked up on the receiver, with a french woman repeating on a loop for 16 years. Has it really been that long? There's a woman named Danielle Rousseau on the island. She was on some sort of a research vessel. It crashed. Her crew died, and she's been sort of wandering around this island. Your distress signal... you said, "It killed them all." Have you seen other people on this island? No, but I hear them. Out there in the jungle... the Others. Listen to me. We're not alone. The big question out there is... Where are they? What is this island? Why can't anybody find them? Why all these people? Why were they all brought together? You know, what were they doing on the plane? These are kind of the big, unanswerable questions in this season, but as we move forward, stuff that we're very focused on answering. I think the show is kind of a giant mosaic, and... you know, we have the present, and we have the past, and there is the future, and by the end of the series, we will have filled in all those tiles, and you'll have not only a sense of who these characters were, who they are, but also who they're going to become. By the end, this picture will form the complete story of "Lost." This is Lost, the answers. Asking the question, "was the crash of Oceanic 815 a random event?" You think we crashed on this place by coincidence? Especially this place? At the center of the show, there has always been this conflict between Jack and Locke, and that... conflict has sort of been rooted on the axis of empiricism versus faith. - We were brought here for a purpose. - And who brought us here, John? The island. You have a guy like Jack, who's basically saying, "This is coincidence." "I was a guy. I got on a plane. The plane crashed on the island." "The island's weird, but that's not my problem. "I just want to get off." I don't believe in destiny. Yes, you do. You just don't know it yet. And then you've got a guy like Locke, who basically says, "There must be a purpose, a design to this." This place is different. He is completely a believer in the island and the island's magical and mysterious powers. He wants there to be an explanation, a meaning to all this. But even Locke's faith was not entirely without reason. He was paralyzed before the plane crashed. Just put me on the bus right now. I can do this. No, you can't. You don't know who you're dealing with! Don't ever tell me what I can't do! Ever! We learned this year exactly how it was that Locke got in the wheelchair. This is... awkward. He finds out his father is this man named Anthony Cooper. Locke loves this man and wants to have a relationship with him. I'm so thankful for you, John. But this is a big elaborate con. You stole my kidney? You needed a father figure, and I needed a kidney. Get over it. So he goes and confronts his father and he says, "I'm going to expose you. I'm gonna rat you out." Phone's right over there, John. When Locke got to this island, suddenly he could walk again. So landing on this island was the greatest thing ever to happen in John Locke's life. He becomes sort of the hero that he always wanted to be in his former life but never could be. The last thing he wants to do is ever go back to the outside world. - I like it here. - I like it here, too. In fact, Locke's conviction led him to solve one of the island's most profound mysteries. He finds this mysterious hatch that's buried in the ground, and he excavates it. So you want me to go down first? Hell, you're lighter. One of the biggest questions ever on the show is, what's in the hatch? What is it? I think there's something down... And the answer is Desmond. Behind you. He was in a solo, around the world sailing race. He crashed on the island. Our gang finally finds him. They discover that this is the first of a series of hatches that were built on this island by this mysterious, Dharma Initiative. You and your partner are currently located in station three, where scientists could work to understand the unique electromagnetic fluctuations emanating from... this sector of the island. The Dharma Initiative was on this island, back in the... late 70's and early 80's and they... built these hatches all over the island where they conducted various scientific experiments, but the most important hatch was called the swan, and that's where Desmond spent three years down there, pushing this button every 108 minutes, and... he was told that if he didn't push that button, the world would end. One day, he actually adventured outside of the hatch. Desmond failed to enter the code in the computer in the hatch. As a result, 815 crashes. - When did you come here? - September, 22nd. I think I crashed your plane. That is the definitive answer as to why the plane crashed. The electromagnetic pulse shot out of the hatch, fried the instrumentation on the plane. The plane crashed. But the crash was not welcome news to a community of people already living on the island... A group the survivors would come to know as the Others. Goodwin. You run, you could make that shore in an hour. Get up there to that fuselage. There may actually be survivors. Listen. Learn. Don't get involved. Go. The Others are a community of around 30 or 40 people, we think. They do not want anyone from the outside world to find them. This is not your island. This is our island. Nor are they particularly happy when new people arrive on the island - and threaten their privacy. - Hello there. Now the first guy we meet is a guy named Ethan. He kidnaps Claire, does all sorts of nasty things to her. You're just gonna feel a little pinch. He ends up getting killed by, uh, Charlie. I wasn't gonna let that animal anywhere near her again. There is this guy... Richard Alpert. We're looking for someone to remind us that we're here for more important reasons. - Then there's mr. Friendly. - It's a good thing we found you. He's actually, in some ways, kind of a nice guy. I'm not showering in front of you. You're not my type. He always has something mean to say, but he makes it sound as nice as possible. What kind of people do you think we are, Jack? The kind of people that would hang Charlie from a tree, kidnap children. We're gonna have to take the boy. Help me, dad! That's the kind of people I think you are. But we do know that he is a football player. Based on the way he throws the ball, I would say he's - probably, on the defense. - Not a quarterback. But Mr. Friendly answers to someone. My name is Benjamin Linus, and I've lived on this island all my life. Ben is the leader of the Others. He is a very interesting and complex guy. You came striding out of the jungle, John, to make my dream come true. He's very smart, he's very creepy, and he's very dangerous. If you want me dead, why don't you just shoot me and get it over with? Because we're not killers, james. This conflict between the Others and our beach survivors has been brewing for the entire history of the show. They've attacked us, sabotaged us, abducted us, murdered us! We're not the only people on this island, and we all know it! For the survivors of Oceanic flight 815, That was weird, right? the search for answers began the very first night. The first mystery of the island was when all of a sudden, the trees were moving, and our characters heard a noise, and they're wondering what the heck is going on out there. The first question is, what does that thing look like? Is it a dinosaur? Is the monster man-made? We don't know. Does the monster have some sort of ability to judge you? Locke passed it the first time he saw it, but then later on, the monster grabbed him and tried to pull him into a hole. And then what does it do with that judgment is a very sort of interesting question as we move forwards on the show. Did you see it, Kate? Then I guess we're both crazy. Now we've seen what it looks like on several occasions. It's this sort of column of mysterious black smoke. This season, when the monster experiences juliet, you see several flashes, almost as if it's taking pictures of her. Is the monster a manifestation of the island? We don't know. We do know that when it looks at you, it seems to be able to process certain memories that you may have had. And some memories can become quite real. We have learned, uh, that the island is... capable of these apparitions. You know, Jack can see his dead father. Walt, who was off, you know, in some other place, mysteriously appears for Shannon and Sayid. Kate sees a horse that was part of her past. All these characters are sort of seeking redemption for misdeeds of their past. Sun and Jin are two survivors who arrived with much to overcome. They came to the island incredibly estranged. You think we should do something? We've learned that Sun had an affaire when her marriage wasn't really working out with Jin. What's wrong? What's wrong is i'm married. Once Sun and Jin got to then they sort of reconciled their relationship. We reveal in her past that she had been told that her and her husband Jin would never be able to have a baby. It's Jin who is infertile, not her. Then we discover that Sun is pregnant. Positive is a positive. But it's impossible. Oh, no, it's possible. And the big mystery is whose baby is it? That question was answered one night, when Sun was brought to the Dharma medical station. You got pregnant on the island. It's Jin's. These are all people who need to redeem themselves. They've made huge mistakes in their past, and now that they're on this island... They get the opportunity to put all those mistakes behind them. Charlie, I need you to go get jack. I might not know what i'm doing, but i'll figure it out. If I can kick drugs, I can deliver a baby. Let me explain. I'm a drug addict. I was a drug addict. I'm clean now. Get Jack! Charlie and Claire have a long and, complicated history together. Charlie starts out very early on kind of providing her comfort, and imagining a jar of peanut butter. Stick to the roof of your mouth. Extra smooth. He loves her, and part of her really loves him, but because Charlie was an addict, Claire isn't entirely sure she can trust him. Give them to me. I'm proud of you, Charlie. Over time, he has become sort of the surrogate father for Aaron, her child, and the three of them kind of comprise the closest thing to a nuclear family that exists on "lost." You know i'm not giving up on you either, Charlie. We'll get through this together. Our characters really seem to be able to rise to the occasion and are incredibly heroic and exhibit qualities that really transcend the people that they once were. Who's that? Her name's Penny. That's not bad, des, not bad at all. Desmond is a guy who's had an issue with cowardice. Desmond, what are you running from? I have to get my honor back. to be a hero in his life. I've gotta go, and you've gotta get as far away from here as possible. System failure. Desmond's moment of heroism arrived when he sacrificed himself to save his new friends. With the turn of a key, Desmond destroyed the hatch, releasing the magnetic pressure and preventing global catastrophe. And in the process, he may have provided the outside world with a clue to the whereabouts of the island. For the first time in the show, we've gone off the island, you find these two guys in this mysterious snow hut someplace, that electromagnetic pulse suddenly makes the island visible, and they pick up the telephone, and they call Penny Widmore... Desmond's girlfriend. I think we found it. The implication is the island is hard to find, and only because of this extraordinary electromagnetic event, did it reveal itself for a moment and was found. That is a big question that remains hanging over the show. Desmond survived the blast with a surprising new ability. He starts having these flash. Sort of precognitive visions of things that are gonna happen in the future. How'd you know claire was drowning? You hear the lightning as well? When I saw the lightning hit the roof, you were electrocuted, and when you heard claire was in the water, you... You drowned trying to save her. No matter what I try to do... You're gonna die, Charlie. Beautiful, isn't it? No matter how much time you spend on the island, you just never get tired of this view. A mysterious place that raises so many questions. What is the history of this island? Why has the island been drawing people to it all this time? The place we're taking you to is special. Special, huh? You'll see things there that you never imagined. The Others... Where did they come from initially? What is their genesis? We know that the Others have been able to leave the island. Go to and from it. They recruit Juliet. Mind if i ask you something? Sure. What do you see? We discovered that Juliet, in fact, is a very successful fertility research doctor. Judging from the decomposition of the endometrium, i would say the the woman was somewhere in the seventies - Well, actually, she's 26. - What happened to her? What if i told you that you could have complete freedom and money to find out? There's something inside of her that is really intrigued by this offer.. We're here. And they actually take Juliet to the island and basically install her their resident expert on fertility. My name is Benjamin Linus. I'm really looking forward to working with you. Her job there is to try to see whether she can find out why pregnant women on the island are dying. I think it happens at conception. There's nothing I can do about it, at least not here. - Not sure I understand. - The only way to see if I'm right - is to take a woman off the island. - No, you're not taking anybody off the island. Juliet, at a certain point, really becomes aware that Ben is manipulating her, and all she wants is to get off this island. That's not our agreement. You need to stay here - until your work is finished. - It's impossible! - The mothers keep dying. - Then we'll find more mothers. We learned that Ben is sick. You're problem is a large tumor surrounding your L4 vertebrae. And right about then, our survivors have sort of entered the world of the Others. Did you see it? A plane fell out of the sky, Mikhail. - Of course we saw it. - When Oceanic 815 crashes, Ben's got live footage of the plane, and the crash news has already hit. I want detailed files on every single passenger. Those files revealed there was a surgeon on board. - Hello again. - Jack and his friends were captured and taken to an abandoned Dharma Station where polar bears were once kept. The Dharma Initiative was doing research on polar bears. They had them in cages. They obviously escaped. They're roaming free. Hey, you got yourself a fish biscuit. - I figured out your complicated gizmo. - Only took the bears two hours. How many of 'em were there? - Jack is being asked to do the surgery. - You need to be in surgery yesterday. All right, then. Whatever you need, it's yours. No, I think you misunderstood me. I didn't say I was gonna do it. I just wanted you to understand how you're gonna die. And Kate is being told that if Jack doesn't do the surgery, - that Sawyer will be killed. - You have to do it. - What? - They're gonna kill Sawyer! One of the big questions that arises on the show is who's Kate gonna choose... Jack or Sawyer. I guess the question was more, who is Kate gonna sleep with first? And we answered that question. Jack now sees this happen. It's this sort of heartbreaking moment. He sees Kate has, in fact, chosen Sawyer. Instead of getting angry, he actually decides to rescue them. Jack begins the surgery, but before he gets too into it, he does a trick. Kate, you have about an hour head start before they come after you. If I don't get a call from you in the next hour, I'm gonna know something went wrong, and he dies! We've got a boat. They're letting us go. - So you're safe, you and Sawyer? - Yes. Yeah. Promise me that you'll never come back here for me. He wants to protect them both. He says it out of love, not out of heartbreak or jealousy. Although Juliet's a woman, and she interprets it a little bit differently. She decides that she's going to throw her lot in with Jack and try to get off the island. He said that if I helped you, that he would finally let me go home. But I don't think that Jack has given up on Kate. No, I don't think so either. - Kate, where are you going? - I don't care what Jack said. They've got him, and we have to get him back. I owe him that. Locke and Kate and Sayid decide to go back across the island in order to get Jack. I'll go around and cover the back, you head in through the side door. What are you doing here? Get out of here. - Jack... - Kate, they're watching me. Step back, doc. I made a deal with them. They're gonna let me go. Where? Home. Jack's goal is simply to get these people off the island. And over the course of this season, we've seen a lot of conflict between Jack and Locke, principally on this exact issue. You don't have to point the gun at me, I can tell you where Jack is. I'm not looking for Jack. I'm looking for the submarine. What submarine? The one you use to travel to and from the island. It started back in season one... Locke's desire to keep everybody on the island, and slowly but surely, he's methodically picking off every possibility of rescue. - What are you doing here, John? - I'm sorry, Jack. Sorry for what? It's been nice chatting. See you in another life, yeah? Crossing paths and intersecting lives... In some sense, I think this show is about about how we are all intertwined in our lives. The linkage between these characters is an important part of their journey, and connected metaphorically, the kind of journeys that we all have in our own lives. But the question remains... Is it all for a reason? I fell in love with the wrong guy. He conned me and embarrassed me. - He was a bad guy. - I have a son who's about your age. We find out, for example, that Jack and Claire have the same father... - And I don't even know your name. - Although they don't know that they are half brother and half sister. I want it to stay that way. These are all stories about, what are the series of events that led them to get on this plane. 'Cause everything had to happen exactly the way that it did happen, and when they bump up against each other, you realize many of them wouldn't have made the choice to get on that plane - were it not for other people. - Tell me, what's a, um, - walkabout? - The walkabout is a journey of spiritual renewal. You wanna tell me something, Reyes? The most significant event in Hurley's life was that he was the lottery winner, that he's worth somewhere north of $150 million. I've had some bad luck, too. My, uh, grandpa Tito died of a heart attack, and the first house I bought my mom burnt down. He bought himself a Chicken Shack restaurant. It's hit by a meteor. Or is it a meteorite? - It's bad luck either way. - He comes to believe that his life is cursed. On the island, he's the guy that everybody loves and gets along with. I bet four papayas. At the same time, he is hoping that this island has shed him of his unlucky curse. I have hope. There is a Dharma bus on the island. He decides that getting this car running will really be a manifestation of the possibility of hope. Son of a bitch. But the van actually represents a little more than just that because Hurley finds a dead body in the van. - Poor... Roger. - "Work man"? - I'm a janitor? - He's, in fact, Benjamin Linus' father. A shocking revelation that we've made recently is that Ben came to the island when he was young child with his father, who was janitor working for the Dharma Initiative. We know that he had a troubled relationship with his daddy. It's your birthday. Sorry I forgot. Kinda hard to celebrate on the day you killed your mom. We went for a hike, but you had to come early. Now she's gone... And I'm stuck here on this island... with you. And that led him to become a fairly dark and twisted individual. I've missed her, too. Maybe as much as you have. But the difference is that for as long as I can remember, I've had to put up with you. Good-bye, dad. Many have wondered what became of the Dharma Initiative. We learned the answer when Ben led a mass extermination and emerged as the leader of the Others. You want us to, - go get his body? - No, leave him out there. And we discovered that the Others and the Dharma Initiative are not the same. So while Sawyer is sitting there next to this skeleton drinking beers, they don't realize the sort of dark story behind this van that has actually unfolded. - He's drinking beers with a skeleton... - Correct. And he's not aware that there's anything dark about that? No, he's having a good time, believe it or not. I mean, you get your kicks any way you can on the island. Ben would be very happy if he was able to be the leader of The Others and was to grow them into a prosperous society, and now John Locke has shown up, and John Locke has sort of exhibited a certain specialness, and that's really threatening to Ben. What if I told you that somewhere on this island there's a very large box, and whatever you imagined, whatever you wanted to be in it, when you opened that box, there it would be. - That was a metaphor. - Dad? The whole island is a magic box. The presence of Anthony Cooper gave Ben an opportunity - to challenge Locke... - When people join us here on this island, they need to make a gesture of commitment. That's why you're gonna have to kill your father. A challenge he knew would end in Locke's disgrace. I'm sorry. He's not who we thought he was. That is, until Richard proposed an alternative. Why would Sawyer kill my father? He doesn't even know him. Keep reading. Sawyer, when we first meet him on the island, he's carrying around this mysterious letter. You wanna know what kind of human being I am? Read it. "Dear Mr. Sawyer, you don't know who I am, but I know who you are and I know what you done." "You had sex with my mother, and then you stole my dad's money all away... " Get under the bed. - Don't make a sound. - Open this door! "So he got angry and he killed my mother... " "and then he killed himself, too." A very big thing that we've learned about Sawyer is that his name isn't Sawyer. The man who conned his parents is named Sawyer, and Sawyer has sort of taken in a bizarre homage - to this man that he wants to kill. - We come to discover that the original Sawyer is actually Locke's father. This is an incredible coincidence as far as he's concerned, but something that Locke knows about, and that's why he puts them in a room together. And now Sawyer has this opportunity to do what he's wanted to do for so long. Read it. When you look at Cooper, he's basically responsible for Locke becoming the man that he became, and he's responsible for Sawyer becoming the man that he became. Thank you. Neither of those men would've ended up on Oceanic 815 were it not for this guy. Locke's return made it clear to Ben, that he was indeed a threat. You said that if I killed my father, you'd tell me everything I wanted to know about the island. So why don't you start at the beginning. Ben takes locke to this cabin as sort of a litmus test to find out if Locke is indeed special, and the way he can determine whether Locke is special is whether he can commune with this mysterious guy, Jacob, who is obviously above Ben in the hierarchy... Help me. And Locke hears Jacob say "help me..." What did you just say? And that is enough for Ben to realize that Locke represents a massive threat to his primacy as the leader of the Others. So he lures Locke out to this ditch where all the dead Dharma bodies were taken. These are my people. They came here seeking harmony. They couldn't even coexist with the island's original inhabitants. I was one of the people that was smart enough to make sure that I didn't end up in that ditch... Which makes me considerably smarter than you, John. Why did you do this? Because you heard him. Now I need to know what he said. He said... "help me." Well, I certainly hope he helps you, John. ...myself to you? You were standing right next to me when that submarine exploded. In that moment, I saw it yours eyes. you want to get off this island more than anything else in the world. Make she's one of us. After a long absence, the leader returned. Jack has now been liberated from the Others. He's now back on the beach camp with everybody else. He brings Juliet with him. What the hell is she doing here? Our people don't trust Juliet. Jack says, "leave her alone." that makes Jack impeachable in everybody else's eyes. They wonder, "why is he protecting her, why is he defending her?" Do you want him to get suspicious? Suspicious of what? Desmond has started having these premitions. There's a wire, a cable buried in the sand. This is future crap, isn't it? This is important. Why? Because someone's coming. - Is that a helicopter? - Rescue. Is that how a helicopter is supposed to sound? The big event that happens is this mysterious woman parachutes on to the island... Sorry. And she's got a picture of Penny and Desmond with her. My God. She is here with a group of people. They're on a freighter 80 miles off the coast, and their job is to come rescue Desmond. It's a satellite phone. Assuming that they can get that radio to work, our guys can call that freighter and they can get rescued. Mom? - But that's never gonna happen. - Well, so you say. If they get off the island, the show's over. - Who are you? - Hugo reyes. I crashed here on Oceanic flight 815. That's not possible. - It wasn't easy, but we found food. - No. They found the plane. There were no survivors. One theory is that they're in purgatory. But you and I have said publicly that they're not in purgatory. They're not ghosts. They are actually alive and breathing somewhere in the space-time continuum. I need to talk to you... In private. Anything you wanna say to me, you can say in front of her. Yeah, you know what? You should stay. It seems only fair considering that she's the reason no one wants to tell you that there's a woman in Hurley's tent who parachuted on to the island yesterday. Why didn't anyone tell me this? Because they don't trust you. We should tell her. We're thinking something is going on between these two, and in fact, something is going on. Juliet has told Jack what her mission is. Juliet, it's Ben. I'm sending three teams to extract Kwon the night after tomorrow. If you determine anyone else is pregnant, mark their tents, and we'll take them, too. And she has basically alerted us to the fact that the Others are now on their way to the beach camp and are going to extract the pregnant women. For the very first time, we know exactly what they want, when they're coming to get it, and they have no idea. So tomorrow night, we stop running, we stop living in fear of them. Because when they show up, we're gonna blow 'em all to hell. The problem is that the Others now know about Naomi, the woman who has parachuted on to the island. If you leave right now, how long will it take you to reach their camp? if i take my ten best, we could set up to hit 'em by nightfall. - Then you better get going. - Juliet may not be ready. - She hasn't had time to... - Then we'll take all of their women. If any of them are stupid enough to get in your way, kill 'em. I can't transmit using this Danielle's distress signal is overriding the frequency. If you tell me where the radio tower is, i can go there, switch off your message and call for help. The signal has been playing for the last 16 years, and nobody has heard it. Ben is using one of the Dharma stations to block all of the signals off of the island except for ours. - What station? - They call it the looking glass. But it's underwater. I have no idea where it is. I believe I do. Sayid found this wire on the beach. We always were wondering, where did that wire go? And now we discover that it actually connects to this station underwater called the "looking glass." Ben told us that the station was completely flooded. If it's flooded, then how does it still work? Even if the station's flooded, I think I'll be able to find the relay switch and disable it. No, I'm not letting you go on some suicide mission just to flip the switch. Someone has to do it, or we never leave this island. I do it. Charlie, unfortunately, has been told that he's gonna die. If you don't, none of it will happen. What? What I saw, Charlie, was Claire and her baby get into a helicopter that leaves this island. All right, tell me. Are you sure you wanna know? I want to know. You're inside a hatch, there's a blinking yellow light, you flip the switch, and you drown. With the threat of the Others imminent, Charlie accepts his faithful mission and instead of being fearful of this, Charlie heroically embraces this fate, and he goes, "so be it." This needs to be done to get us all rescued. I'll be fine, Claire. But you've got to promise me something. Don't worry about me. True heroes are sort of born out of moments. And the reality is, is most of our characters are heroes. When the proverbial Others are coming... Do you man up and take action? So here we go again, huh? Here we go again. These guys always act most nobly when they act in the spirit of the community. They protect each other. Wait. Dude, it's fine. I don't even want to go on your stupid boat. Just remember I love you, man. Whatever, I love you, too. The question remains, what is the state of our cast aways? Are they gonna get off this island? Automatically, it's about the people. It always has been. This island is given them an opportunity to completely reinvent themselves, and that change for these characters is really what the endgame of the show will be all about. I'm alive! Lost Special
