We know of the abuses. How could we not know? We have been fold of the indignities. How could we not hear? Six dollar salaries. Our men carrying their own machines to work. Cheated on piecework. Our girls given $4 and $3 a week... because they are called "learners," when all there is for them to learn about are screaming foremen. Stinking toilets that overrun the workroom. Winters without heat. Being charged for the electricity they use, the needles they sew with, the very chairs they sit in. Here, here in what in only a few weeks will be... the tenth year of the 20th century, we have seen our small strikes smashed, our brave girls battered by the goons... and our own New York policemen. Yes, a general strike hangs in the air here tonight... like the smoke from the flames within you, the anger within you all. Yes, the proper response to these outrages... is to be outraged. And yet we say, "Wait." And yet we urge caution. We are a new union, not yet strong, not strong enough for victory. Our own Mr. Gompers, he has just pleaded with you to use deliberation, to know that strikes are a method of last resort. Excuse me, miss, but you're not listed on this program. And in an event like this, we must proceed... It is Clara Lemlich, beaten by the goons of Leiserson. Let her speak! She is just today from the hospital. Uh, miss, unfortunately in a program this length... Let Clara Lemlich speak! Tell them, Clara. Yes/ Hear me! What is she saying? Please. "I am a working girl." "I wanna use striking against the intolerable conditions." I am tired of listening to all these speakers. Jetzt! Jetzt! All right, all right! Will you, all of you...

Also, they say they gonna call Immigration on me, even though they know I'm legal. The bosses, the bosses. Their tactics haven't changed in a century. Frighten the foreign-born and exploit the immigrant. Reign by terror. And the answer to all of this? Organize. All of you. A "roll-out." Listen to me now. Grab your walkers. Grab your canes. Roll those wheels. Join the workers outside. Show your support! Samuel Gompers. I remember him. He's dead. - Yes, but there's a chance... - So is Communism. And Clara Lemlich too. She was cute.

Whatever I say, you say, "I'm not Rappaport". You got that? Yeah, I got it. Yeah. Okay. Stand there. Now picture we just met. I'm not Rappaport. No, no, not yet. Not yet. - Yeah, yeah. - Okay? Hello, Rappaport. I'm not Rappaport. Rappaport, what happened to you? You used to be a short, fat guy. Now, you're a tall, skinny guy. I'm not Rappaport. Rappaport, you used to be a young guy with a beard. Now you're old with a moustache. What happened to you? I'm not Rappaport. Rappaport, what happened to you? You used to dress up nice. Now you got old, dirty clothes. I am not Rappaport. And you changed your name too! And you changed your name too. Lord. You changed your name too. Boy, that's a... There you are, Carter. Carter! Oh, shit, he's here. Couldn't find you. Ah, excellent. He's here. I gotta shape up. Look, are you my friend, baby? Of course. Then, friend, sit over there. And don't open your mouth. Not a word, mister. Please. You call me when you need me? Soon as I need you. Please. Okay. Over there. Over there. Okay. Remember, I'm ready. I know that. Beautiful day like today, you must've lost track. Hey, man. I don't think we've ever been formally introduced. I'm Pete Danforth. Hi, Pete. They call me Midge. Hi, Midge. Glad we decided to meet in the park. It's a chance for me to stay outside after my run. The truth is, I hate running. Being immortal takes too much time. "Midge" for midget. Third wife give me that name. Near three-quarter inches taller than me so she called me "Midge." Name stuck with me 50 years. I tell you one thing, it is good to be reminded what a great park this is. It's a goddamn oasis in the middle of the jungle. Next two wives was normal-size women. Don't make much sense. Still stuck with the name of "Midge." I mean, look at this wonderful... house... full of old boats. What do they call this place, Midge? They call it the old boathouse. Damn right. ♪♪ Dad? Dad? Those were the days, weren't they? I mean, look aft this. And this place. And the lake. I mean, even in the rain I just... I just love this park. And luckily... luckily my teaching schedule gives me two free afternoons a semester. A chance to really use the park. It's been years. Oh, I teach Communication Arts over at the Manhattan Institute on 60th. There's no air in the place. What kind of arts? Ah, communication. Communication of all kinds... Personal, interpersonal and public. You teach talkin'? More or less, yes. So you must know we about at the end of the chitchat section now, right? Right. Right. The problem that we've got here... Here, have a seat. Uh, the problem we've got here hadn't come to my attention sooner... simply because you, personally, hadn't come to my attention. Frankly, I've been living there for three years. I've never run into you. Mostly down in the boiler room. Don't get many drop-ins. Of course. Keep movin', boy. You're on a roll now. Yes, well. Um, as you know, 321 is going co-op in November. We'll be closing on that in November. We've got Brachman and Rader as our managing agent. I think they're doing an excellent job. And as president of the tenants' committee, I'm pretty much dependent... Well, the whole committee is really... on their advice. We've basically got to place our faith in the recommendations of the managing agency. And they're recommending you dump me? Midge, we've got some real problems about your remaining with the building staff. Ain't that the same as dumpin' me? Well, it's not for eight weeks. It's not till November. But, yes, we will have to let you go. Now, there are various benefits. There's the union pension plan. There's six weeks' severance pay. Now that's a check for six weeks' salary the day you go. That's... Midge, I'm sorry. God, I hate this. I... How 'bout I hate it first, then you get your turn? Time, Midge. Time is the only villain here. Man. Man, we're all fighting it. Jesus. Have you seen me run? It's a joke. I can't do the things I did a few years ago either. Hey, don't sweat it, son. You see, Brachman and Rader, all due respects, full of shit. The fact is, you need me. You got an old Erie City boiler down there. Things about that weird machine no living man knows except Midge Carter. Take me till Christmas. Christmas, yeah. Train a new man how to handle that devil. Midge, we're replacing the Erie City. We're installing a fully automatic Rockmill 500. It requires no maintenance. You see, the Rockmill is just one of many steps in an extensive modernization plan... Well, now you're gonna need me. Pipes and wires, and 40 years of temporary stuff. That's what you got there. With no blueprint to show you where it is. And I got it all in my head. I know what's behind every wall, every stretch of tar. So, here's the deal. My place in the basement, I stay on there for free like I been. You get all my consulting free, no salary. Beauty deal for you. Midge, your unit in the basement is being placed on the co-op market as a garden apartment. Please understand, we've had a highly qualified team of building engineers... Forget it! They've done this survey. I'm not interested in the job, no other job. I'm withdrawing my offer. - No, Midge, please listen. - All this time I've been living in a garden apartment. Wish I'd have known sooner. I'd have had a whole lot of more parties. I'm sorry. The problem is... The problem is you giving me "bad guy news" trying to look like a good guy doing it. You're right. You're right, Midge. You're dead right. I have handled this whole thing badly... just stupidly, stupidly. Oh, I'm sorry, this... this whole thi... Oh, this is terrible. Don't worry about it, Pete. You'll get through it. No, no, Midge, wait, please. I'm gonna get you... 10 weeks' severance, Midge. Forget six. A check for 10 weeks' salary the day you go. I'm gonna hand it to you personally. And if that committee doesn't like it, well then, just... to hell with them. I'm just gonna shove it through. It's the least I can do. Ten weeks' severance, Midge. Now how does that sound to you? Well, better than six, I guess. - Wait, wait... - It's a promise, Midge. Gonna shove it down their throats. I'm sure I'm gonna have no trouble with that committee. Unacceptable! We find that unacceptable. Mr. Danforth. Mr. Danforth, I'll speak frankly. You are in a lot of trouble, sir. Ben Reissman; Reissman, Rothman, Rifkin and Grady. Forgive me for not announcing myself sooner, but I couldn't resist listening to you bury yourself. My firm represents Mr. Carter over there, but more to the point. We act as legal advisers to the HURTSFOE unit of Mr. Carter's union. HURTSFOE... I refer to the Human Rights Strike Force, who, I'm sorry to tell you, you'll be hearing a lot from in the next few weeks. Personally, I think their methods are a bit too extreme, but I report and advise. That's all I can do. The ball is rolling here, Mr. Danforth. Go away. Mr. Carter keeps telling us to go away, but as he knows we are an automatic function of his union... for the protection of all members. I have no choice. The man wants to give me 10 weeks' severance. A joke! The man is a jokester. Look, Reissman... Yes, speak to me. I'm not sure I understand the situation. Of course not. How could you? Here, sit down. I'll explain it to you. I'll educate you. Sit down. The situation is simple. We don't accept 10 weeks' severance. We don't accept 20 weeks' severance. What we accept is that you retain Mr. Carter in the capacity of adviser... during your reconstruction period, which I assume will take a year, maybe two, at which point, we'll talk further. I don't know this man. I don't know him. Of course not. Mr. Carter is more familiar with Riftkin and Grady, the gentler gentlemen of our firm. It was thought best to bring the "Cobra" in on this one. It's an affectionate term for me at the office. Look, Reissman. Yes, speak to me. I don't know what your game is, fella, and I don't know your organization, but I do know Local 32 of the Service Employ... And do they know that you are planning to fire Mr. Carter? Not yet, but... And do you know that there is no mandatory retirement age in Mr. Carter's union? Do you know further that this gives Mr. Carter the right... to call an arbitration hearing where he can defend his competence? And that you have to get a minimum of four tenants to testify against him? Find them. I would love to see this, Mr. Danforth. Four tenants who wanna be responsible... Publicly responsible for putting this old man... out of his home and profession of 42 years. A man who was voted "Super Of The Year"... by the New York Post in 1968. A man who fought in World War Ill. A man who served with the now legendary Black Battalion of Bastogne... during the Battle of the Bulge. And are you aware that for as long as you insist on pursuing this matter, for as long as this hearing lasts, that you can make no contract with Local 327 And that without a union contract, there can be no co-op sales... No building corporation! Time, my friend, will be your villain now! I'm talking months, cookie. I'm talking litigation, appeals, the full weight and guile... of Rothman, Rifkin, Grady and the Cobra. I'm... Speak to me. I'm, frankly, a little thrown by this. I knew about the right to arbitration, Midge. I never thought you'd want to put yourself through something... He wants! Meanwhile, HURTSFOE goes after you tomorrow anyway. - They'll make an example of you. You're perfect for them! - What have I done? Sir, you have hit every human rights' nerve there is. I'm talking old. I'm talking black. I'm talking racial imbalance. Racial imbalance? The man was walking into walls for God's sake. He's an easy 80. There is nothing, sir, I promise you, easy about 80. Damn it, why am I bothering to warn you? You'll see it all tomorrow. Time to let HURTSFOE out of its cage. I find it hard to believe I would be held responsible... You will believe tomorrow when you see those pickets in front of your school! What's the name of that place? The Manhattan Institute. Then those demonstrators in front of your apartment building, the name Danforth will become an adjective, sir. A new word for the persecution of the old and disabled, the black and the blind. Now, wait a minute! Do it, Danforth! Do it! Fire him! It's your one shot at immortality. Yes, I'm sorry, Carter. I wanna see HURTSFOE in action again. Those crazy wildcats. Those mad, inspired men. I wanna hear those words alive again and pure: "Strike for humane existence. Strike for universal justice. - "Strike! Strike! Strike! Strike!" - Strike! "Strike! Strike..." Hold on. Wait a minute! Now this whole goddamn mess has just gotten out of hand here! Now, look, Reissman, believe me, this was never my own personal thing. I represent a committee... I'm sorry. The spotlight falls on you because it must, because you are so extraordinarily ordinary, because there are so many of you now. You collect old furniture, old cars, old pictures, everything old but old people. Bad souvenirs, they talk too much. Even quiet, they tell you too much. They look like the future, and you don't wanna know. Hey, mister, don't you know... one day you too will join this weird tribe? Yes, Mr. Chairman, you will get old. And if you're frightened now, you'll be terrified then. The problem is not that life is short, but that it's very long. So you better have a policy. Here, look at us. Here we are. We're the coming attractions. And if you're afraid of it, you'll be afraid of us. You'll wanna hide us or make us hide from you. You're dangerous. Don't you understand? The old people, they're the survivors. They know something. They haven't just stayed late to ruin your party. What you'd like is for Carter to be nice and cute and quiet and go away. But he won't do that. I won't let him. Tell him he's slow or stupid, okay. But tell him he's unnecessary, and that's a sin! That is a sin against life! That is abortion at the other end! Ben, I'm glad you shared these thoughts with me. I'd never really... I'm through communicating with you. Carter, I'm communicating only with you now. What shall we do with him? I leave it up to you. I think we ought to give him a break. Ben, I-I-I'm sure I can persuade the members of the committee to reevaluate Midge's... Are you saying you don't care what happens to the cause? You just wanna keep your job, Midge, and forget the cause? Yeah, that's what I'm saying. Keep the job, forget the cause. Guys, I think it's essential that we avoid any extreme... Are you asking the Cobra not to strike? Don't want the Cobra to strike, no. Mr. Danforth, my client has instructed me to save your ass. Quickly, the bomb is ticking. Jog home to your phone now. Call the members of your committee. Don't persuade. Don't explain. Just announce. Tell them there's a job for Mr. Carter... Guide, counselor, superintendent emeritus... That has a nice sound to it. Meanwhile, speak to no one. Your union, your managing agent, no one. HURTSFOE gets wind of this, we're all in trouble. Here. When you're finished, call that number... before 10:00 tomorrow if you wanna stop HURTSFOE. Park East Real Estate? Yes. Yes. That's HURTSFOE's advisory group. Speak only to the lady on the card, Mrs. Clara Gelber. Tell her to reach Bartley at the HURTSFOE office. Bartley. Bartley will know what to do. Good-bye and good luck. Midge, Ben, I just want you to know that... this has been a very important conversation for me for many reasons. A lot of primary thoughts. Excellent. Good-bye. An important exchange of ideas. A sudden awareness of certain generational values... I warn you, sir, one more word and I will make a citizen's arrest... for crimes against the language. Go now! It's true. I sometimes just don't know how to talk... Go! Go to the phone! Let me see those sneakers, Flash. ♪♪ Never. We ain't never gettin' away with this.

I put it in my papers, a letter for you when I died, so you would've known then. Your mother and I was not the liveliest association, but there was a great fondness. Whatever I tell you now, you must know that. August, 1939, the day of the Hitler/Stalin pact, a passionate gathering at the Young Workers' Club. I meet Ethel, your mother. Soon, my heart is hers. We're married. Five years later you're born. Then during the next 10 years those other people. Everything's fine. All is well. Then... October, 1956... October the 3rd. Tell me. What is it? I met a girl. I fell in love. It happens, Pop. You're only human... I mean, I fell in love, Clara, for the first and only time in my life. Boom. What happened? Where did you meet her? It was the Grand Street Library, second floor reading room. I'm at the main table. I look up. I see this lovely girl, Hannah... Hannah Pearlman. She's reading a grammar book. She looks up. She smiles at me. I can't speak. She goes back to her book. She has a sad look. Someone alone. I see a girl, troubled, lonely. I can't speak. Pretty soon she rises to leave. Someone should speak to her. I speak. I speak, and for hours my words come out, and for hours and days after that in her little room on Ludlow Street. It was the most perfect time. She tells me I've saved her life. I saved her from killing herself. Just in time. Just in time. She didn't die, Clara. She did not die. Well, I'm married to Ethel. Nothing can come of it. Four months, it's over. She goes to live in Israel. Six months later, a letter. There's a child. My God. A girl. Then every year or two after that, a letter. Time goes by. I think often of Ludlow Street and the library. And then silence. No more letters. Never another one. Three months ago I get a message at the Socialist Club... "Sergeant Pearlman will be here at 5:00." 5:00, Sergeant Pearlman at the door. It's a girl. In Israel, women, everybody, gotta serve in the army for two years. Well, Sergeant Pearlman... Yes? Sergeant Pearlman is my daughter. Her face like her mother's. A fine, fine face, like a painting. She herself is an artist. She's come to this country to go to the Art Students' League and to find me. Well, the point is, Clara, that she's decided to live with me, to take care of me. That's why I'm telling you all this so you'll know. In December, we... We're going to Israel. This is where I will end my days. So you see, Clara, you have nothing to worry about. This is... This is a lot for me to take in all at once. A lot of information. It's not easy, but it's better you know now. I wanna meet her. You shall. When? Two days, Friday, at the Socialist Club. In the dining room. Friday. Lunchtime. I'll bring sandwiches. Good. She'll take care of you. That's the point. Israel. Clara, don't be upset. It's for the best.

They said they would have kept me longer, except for the fact that I talked too much, annoyed the customers. I presently reside, and have for some time, at the Amsterdam Hotel where my main occupation... is learning more things about tuna fish than God ever intended. In other words, whatever was said previously, I was and am now, no one. No one at all. This is the truth. Good-bye and good luck to you and your knife. Better get goin' to the center. At 7200, guest speaker... Jerome Cooper will lecture on timely issues for the aging. Refreshments will be served to anyone who's alive at the end. Shit. Man, you still can't tell the truth.

I had written a few articles for the papers. Some theories on the subject. Suddenly, they call for me. They fly me out there. Boom, I'm a mogul. The industry needs answers. What should I do? What did you do? Well, that's a long story. That's a long and complicated story. You see, there was an outfit called... the House Un-American Activities Committee. These were a bunch of evil men posing as good guys. They were in the House of Representatives mostly. And what they were trying to do was scare the entire population... into thinking the way they thought. And since they were a bunch of bad guys, they were thinking bad thoughts. You follow me?
