I am the supervisor. I was originally a human. I see it all. Coming from the year 2518. I can keep track of all sides of the galaxy. It's 200 years after the rise of the group. Evidence from genetic experiments. Evidence of an unknown technology. Evidence of human DNA inserted DNA is not known. Source, the outside world and everything. Pieces voice believed to be the supervisor. Evidence about the supervisor prior to modification. The discovery that is was highly sensitive information. Recording history has risen. Complex life is rare in the universe. It is believed that intelligent life begins on earth. But I find that advanced technology more than a million a year earlier. Creatures of this world, Master who visited Earth in the past and accelerate our evolution. Unfortunately, the human empire rose. Wise enough to do space travel. This is the first foundation of the federation. The world discovered that the earth and capable of changing the world be thousands of copies of the earth. Unofficially, the machine intelligence becomes dominant and we tackle them all. We fight and we win at twenty-eight billion lives. I was born in the midst of this terrible war. When you can stop it in three million. Through the blood of a master, I became immortal. I have been given a vision and I have found two great federations. I have chosen my preferred program. I have made the earth as much force and some other colonies. But someone must be responsible for the future of the human race. As long as we fix, restore, and breathing. Mankind will be back on the victory. The kindness of the Master has given me extension of lives. But now I have to bring myself for further modification. If Masters is embedded in my DNA. I will live and will be returned. If this fails, it will take my life experiments. If I survived, I claimed the throne and supervisor immortal. And control the entire galaxy. Those who oppose me must die. 200 YEARS LATER Terminus. The capital of the world. Great empire has fallen. I grew up in the twilight of a great empire. It starts from cleaning the entire empire crumbling and construction of something new. Even as a boy, I can feel the damage. Handcuff. Only a matter of time. We oppose dumb wars Terranostra this fight. We asked supervisors galaxy started to provide funding for the war and to help its own people. Puppet federation. We ask you to think about ...

Terranostra was sent to prison for the federation. Controlled by some religious populations who all love to hate. You could say there is a cancer that grows in their rankings. The new weapon could threaten Terra supervisor and the evil federation. It is the prototype of a battle star. The fastest, emotionless, and rough in the federation. Bringing thousands of missile destroyers. Each missile can destroy each lives in the world 9. I, supreme king Terranostra declared war against the federation and to keep the peace. Stay with us.
