Yes, it's me... "I'm the protagonist of this story". Sounds like a useless affirmation you want to believe when you feel the urgent need to take charge of your life. "I'm the protagonist of this story". The perfect quote to have tattooed on your forearm. But often we forget about a very important thing. That if there's a story, there's also a writer. Someone with the power to decide what's happened and what's about to happen. Well... I didn 't just want to be the protagonist, I wanted to be the writer. No, that doesn't make sense. Just six months ago I was flabby, dorky and depressed. This is me... Andrea Serrano, 29, aspiring writer. PLOT TWIST NEEDED I was neither the writer nor the protagonist. I just had a blurry walk-on part in someone else's life. THIS GUY'S A BORE I WANNA SCRAM ls "scram" spelt with a K ? - No. - But only one M, right? You're okay with me seeing other guys, right? 'Cause we're not an item ! Maybe the final walk-on part in their already useless Iives. The way they died usually made no sense. "Died on the way to his 40th birthday party. Run over by the van delivering his cake." You're not paid to read the reports ! Get the inspiration for your stories from elsewhere ! Know how lucky you are ? Loads of people want to be corpse washers ! Loads! Don't you also think that your life is just a series of coincidences ? That everything that happens to you is devoid of any beauty. Scenes from a story with no protagonist and with no writer. That's the problem. A story cannot be created by chance, because chance is just shitty slime. I've enjoyed doing drama series but now I feel that I need... a powerful story. It can be tragic or dramatic. Maybe of social value. But it has to be good. IT DOESN'T END HERE That's why you're still listening to me. To my story. You're looking for the meaning your lives lack. What's the expression ? "Take charge of your life". How many times have you tried ? A diet you saw in a gossip mag to increase energy levels. A new look "to redefine yourself". But I'm sure the thing you didn't do was spend the last of your savings to publish a book that only sold 188... 187 copies. It was no good... nothing changed. Don'tjust stand there ! Clean up that filth, move it ! Come on ! I could replace you in a flash with Dede. He's much more suited to this job than you. Hello ? Andrea Serrano ? It's Oscar Martello, the producer. read your book, I'd like to meet you. This is the plot twist that I was talking about. Oscar Martello, one of the most important producers in Rome. Which, besides, is the only place in Italy where films are made. They say he never sleeps and like all those who are filthy rich he's unhappy, especially at night. But in the day he steams straight ahead even when there's a bend in the road. With the typical attitude of those who want to leave their mark on the world. He came from nothing and conquered Rome, as well as marrying one of the richest ladies around. Two daughters: Cleo and Zoe, and although his affection for them is debatable, he wants to protect them from the mark he wishes to leave on the world. Perhaps this is why he can't sleep. No, ltold him that... Yes, he agreed ! He... He just needs to sign then we'll all agree to it... Rodolfo, write this: "She's asleep on the bed, half-naked. Outside: the sound of cicadas. It is night. Suddenly a shadow appears, she jumps up, she turns around, sees a skeletal hand, jumps off the bed, runs along a really long corridor followed by thousands of shadows. She runs towards a car that explodes. Title: 'City of Shadows'. A series by Oscar Martello. Did you get that ? - But I'm not Rodolfo. - Who the fuck are you ? It's Ronaldo, the writer of the drama series. Fuck off! Call Rodolfo, give him the film plot, we'll make money. Life's too short ! We'll sleep when we're dead. Oscar has never read an entire book, but he knows men, he knows women, and he knows what they both want. - Hello, are you there ? - Yes. What are you waiting for ? Come over, we're throwing a huge party tonight. All the big shots from the film world will be here ! - Where ? - At my house, in Rome ! Just get to the station, jump in a taxi and say: "Martello's party". 300 pages, I ain't reading that, for fuck's sake ! Dede, what is there after death ? After death... there's techno music. Serrano. Here you are. Mr Martello will see you in his study. Fiore, take the gentleman through. That's Picasso work ! No, it's Mr Martello's. Yes, no, I meant... You know why I bought your book ? I liked the colour of the cover. I wanted to ask my upholsterer to make some curtains of the same colour. Wouldn't that look great? You know what this dull grey is called ? Nimbus. Then I read the first 30 pages and I thought: "This will make a great film !" Are you thinking of buying the rights or will I be involved in the project, sir ? Did you call me "sir" ? You called me "sir" ! Oscar! Our guests are waiting, honey. Remo's here too now. Remo Golia. Italy's biggest film distributor. The hermaphrodite called me "sir". Nimbus ! Oh, this is my wife. Oscar likes to make people feel awkward so he can call the shots. I'm Helga. Andrea. Andrea Serrano. Look who's here ! 80, animal, how are you ? I liked it! Your story is amazing. Her getting revenge on the Camorra. The distributor will love it too. Remo ! - Oscar ! - Remo, my friend ! How are you ? Have you got the project for that maddo who calls me every day ? Don't worry, it's all under control ! No, you don't get it. If we don't make a film with her, she'll have us jailed ! I have a fantastic project ! Come meet your film's distributor. Remo Golia, Oscar... What's your goddamn name ? I forgot. No, I'm Oscar! He'll release 400 copies and you'll be a star. Helga, look who's here, our dear friend Remo. - Have some food, it's a honey-based menu. - Made by me ! You're obsessed with honey ! I can't stand it ! I started out as a runner for a guy called Pasquale Razzi. Do you know him ? Pasquale Razzi was a producer, he'd snort the entire budget of the film even before shooting started. He had two passions: pussy and cocaine. And he died like a jerk. - Are you having fun ? - Loads. I wanted to know if you had any ideas about the cast, the director... You're talking shop now ? Have some fun ! This is "Sweet Rome", you see ? I wasn't the writer of this story yet. Otherwise the chance to fulfil my dream would've been slightly different. Was I really ready to risk losing my reassuring and miserable same old life ? Jacaranda Ponti, the actress, was a part of the dream that I hadn't taken into account. Italian TV dramas are crap, they're fake, overly-slick, dead. Don't you agree ? Why are you here ? Well, I'm... a writer, Andrea Serr... I meant why are you here, outside ? Are you leaving ? Maybe. How about you ? - Why are you here ? Are you bored ? - Maybe. No, ljust hate these parties. They keep offering me roles in TV dramas, like nuns who reunite divorcees... Brave mothers who rescue immigrants with dinghy boats. Too beautiful to be real. Seems like something worth taking a risk for. But be careful, she's the type who promises you heaven, scrambles your brain with Ketamine then drinks it through a straw. Whereas Oscar promises you hell, takes you there then leaves you the bill to pay. Enjoy. I have a great project for you. An extraordinary film, a brilliant story. I'm not lying. Not really. Open the door, bastard ! LeIIo Jovine. I'd forgotten about him. I know you're in there ! A Camorra gangster working for Northern Italy's biggest criminal organization. He was a regular client of ours. He'd managed to persuade my boss to dispose of the surplus goods their business produced. I read this shitty book. The problem is he never shut up. He tried to run away but we were right on his heels. He talked and I took notes for my book on the Camorra. And it doesn't end here. You're a crap writer ! And you've told everyone our business, you bastard ! So when will you sign the contract ? Don't tell me you were scared by Rome ! Jacaranda said she absolutely wants to star in your film. I think she's fallen for you. Jacaranda ! Open the door or I'll smash it down ! Shall I smash it down ? What risks are you willing to take ? Smash it down ! Lello, that bastard's escaped. Shit, Spadino, you don't miss a trick ! Bastard ! It doesn't end here ! Let's go. Do you have a place in Rome ? I produce films but invest in property. Go on, take your pick. Monteverde: great choice. The home of depressed but pleasant intellectuals. Plenty of green. - I don't know, I feel awkward. - Don't, it'll come out of your pay. Come on, let's go christen it ! We're at the Venice Film Festival: Best Short Film Award and this dickhead wins with an amazing film. It's the story of an elderly couple who take in a sort of hobo. First they torture him, then they kill him and eat him ! Christ, he's a genius ! Then on the news, he said: My parents were my inspiration. I immediately signed a contract with him for two films. The first he'll direct will be yours. Look what I brought. Mint, for mojitos. l'|| teach you how to drink. Faggots ! ONE MONTH LATER We'll start with a sequence shot, a long take... Fabris, if you do loads of long shots, they won't be editable. Exactly. That's the whole purpose. So the producer won't be able to edit it. TWO MONTHS LATER How's the screenplay coming along ? It's a masterpiece. But we're still working on it. Good, do a good job or both of your careers will be over. The art of writing is the re-writing, you beast ! Try to understand ! THREE MONTHS LATER The camera starts on Mont Blanc. Then zooms into her house, then zooms into the bathroom, then zooms into a shot of her nipple. A meeting of opposites. Like Malick's "Tree of Life". It's the story of a woman who gets her revenge on the Camorra. - Why Mont Blanc ? - Oh, God ! You're such a downer! Mt. Vesuvius is a bad omen. You saw what happened in Pompeii ? It'd be more dynamic. Can we go somewhere quieter to talk ? We're having fun, it's a party. Please. Okay. Get to know each other. Are you going outside ? I wonder why Oscar's so keen on you. Mine are big shots. What does your father do ? - He's a plumber. - A plumber... A plumber, cool. Shit, how cool. - For you. - Thanks. Do you like this place ? Yes, it's nice. No. It's crap. And the food is gross. I only come here to remember where I came from. I come from nothing, like you. You don't know where I come from. It's obvious, social housing, outskirts of the outskirts, parents who are losers from way back, whose kids learn to be even bigger losers. But suddenly one day your third eye opens up ! Bingo ! And you say: "Shit, not me !" Because isn't being a loser aboutjust letting things happen by chance ? - I know. You know jack shit. You need to ask yourself... Why do I write ? Why do I tell stories ? So I won't be a loser. When I write a story, everything that happens makes sense, it has meaning, there's harmony. Nothing is "by chance". There's just beauty. But honestly, Oscar, working with Fabris isn't easy. I know. I know you can't stand him. He may be a dickhead, but behind every choice, there's a reason, right ? And compromises, sacrifices. Every choice has a reason. And you need to make this choice, you need to take charge of your life, if you want your life to have a meaning, you need to work out... ..what risks I'm willing to take. Correct. Beauty is achieved through... strategy, sacﬁﬁce and taking risks. To taking risks ! We're definitely taking a big one ! At your age, I had no money. In restaurants, I'd feign a heart attack to avoid paying the bill. Shit, those were wonderful times. Everything was yet to be written, discovered... stolen. Please, Oscar. Don't feign a heart attack. Help ! Help ! My friend's not feeling good. I need... He's not well. Whatever... it's 43 euros. Thanks. The problem is that everyone knows you're a bastard. If you can't lie, why the hell are you in Rome ? This city has two fundamental rules: no one ever says what they think, and no one ever does what they say. How do you know I can't lie ? ljust do ! I've been on the streets for 30 years. Shit, you think I don't know how to live ? Plus I like you, I like talking to you. I like sharing things with you. Can I share something with you then ? - Sure ! We're friends, right? - Okay. Fabris is a jerk. He'll destroy the film. Replace him. - Take one ! - It's not raining ! Stop arguing ! Just take one and come here. I can't argue over an umbrella too ! - Hit me! - Sorry ? Hit me, go on ! I'm taking a gamble. If you hit me, Fabris goes to hell and you'll direct the film. Don't move ! Do you know why you work, you dickhead ? Because I suck up to the bankers, I corrupt the priests, I bribe the MPs and bring whores to the TV bosses. What the fuck do you do ? What's your strategy ? I'm the one who loses sleep ! I stink of shit so much that I can't even hug my daughters. What goddamn risks are you willing to take ? Have you ever given up someone you loved ? Go fuck yourself ! Fiore ! You've got big-headed. You need to eat some humble pie. Come here, dammit. You'll go back on set with Fabris, and you'll keep schtum for two months, understood ? Or I'll send you back to the shithole you came from ! I care about you ! You're the son I never had. Now fuck off ! Open this goddamn door! Hello ? Yes, I'm fine. No, I'm just out of breath. Because I'm... Tell the doctor I'm fine ! I've had a quadruple bypass. I have an implant that alerts the hospital ! Yet I'm arguing with a dickhead ! Go fuck yourself ! Go on ! Drive ! Just drive, or I'll buy myself a taxi ! Beauty is achieved through strategy and taking risks. What the fuck do you do ? What's your strategy ? Good morning, Helga. Andrea ! How nice to see you. Getting ready for the next party ? Yes, the usual honey-based menu. We always get loads of compliments. Try some. I love it. It's sweet, enticing... but there's often a risk you'll get embroiled in it. A bit like this city. Look how hard they work to produce something that will be taken from them. It reminds me of my work. It's rather symbolic. Is there a reason you've come here ? I'm worried that Fabris will ruin the film and destroy my career and Jacaranda's. You needn't worry about that. Oscar will find a way to save face. How can you be so sure ? Oscar cares about his favourite mistress much more than he appears to. Didn't you know ? Have I upset you ? I've broken your heart, I'm sorry. You haven't broken my heart. I like you, Andrea. You remind me of Oscar when I first met him. And I know you're about to make the same mistakes he made. I can see it. What can you see ? You'll probably marry a woman who's much wealthier than you, whose riches you'll squander, whilst filling a foreign bank account, with the hope of one day fulfilling your dream... To elope with the actress and lover with whom you think you're in love. I've never been in love. Good. Love's for commoners. SWEET ROME Would you like to say goodbye to your girls before they go to school ? Are you going to school ? Good girls. Off you go. Study hard, I was already supporting a family at your age. Off you go ! Walk there, it's good for you. Does Dad wear a mask to fight ? Your dad always wears a mask when he fights. Oscar, did you want to see me ? We'll start shooting the film tomorrow so we have quite a bit to do. Listen up, you budget-style Tarkovsky... I've read the screenplay. I understood jack shit. I don't understand. What do you mean ? Do the scenes have to be that long ? If it weren't necessary, I wouldn't have made them so long, Oscar... Listen to Andrea. He's smart, he's competent. He's got brains, understood ? Have you finished ? Is there anything else ? If you screw up the film, l'|| break your legs, put them in plaster cast then I'll smash that too. Okay. Bye Oscar ! See you tomorrow ! On the set. And we'll start with the shoot-out scene. "It Doesn't End Here", scene one, take one ! Start the rain ! Action ! This is how I'd imagined this scene when I wrote it. Instead... no rain. Rain costs too much. No slow motion. No night-time. That costs too much too. And above all... no cool location. We shouldn't have used a steady shot. This needed a tracking shot ! A long tracking shot... like the maestro Michelangelo Serpentino shows us. Stop ! I've told you a billion times, Jacaranda ! Your face has to express your character's internal turmoil ! You're not doing that! You're not doing that! What turmoil are you talking about? Jacaranda, my dear girl, think about something sad ! Like the famine in the world ! Just fucking think about that ! What the fuck are you saying ? How fucking long does he take to die ? This film's crap ! Count me out! You see ? She's a spoilt brat. - Super spoilt. - Fuck you ! Spoilt brat ! Go play with your dolls ! In your caravan, go on ! Well, shall we take a break ? Mayl? Close the door. You're right. But it's also our first day on the set. Maybe he'll change. And it's the story that counts, right? That's what Oscar thinks too. Look at him. Him and Oscar chose a random project because with what I know about them I could ruin them, so to shut me up... Do you understand ? They don't give a damn about your story ! I'm sorry. Don't worry about what Fabris says. You're perfect. I like your story. Can you leave me alone with my leading actress ? I hope I didn't interrupt anything,. What are you doing ? Are you flirting with my screenwriter ? You know I'll getjealous. Go back to your wife, go on ! It's baking hot. Guys, don't you think we'll stand out? It's not obvious that we're gangsters. Are you the gangsters ? You're an hour late ! Knock him out! So where are these goddamn gangsters ? There are too many people making this shitty film ! Let's go. We'll talk to the producer some other time. Oscar. - Everything okay ? - Yes, yes. If that maddo talks, we'll end up in jail. Don't worry, it's all under control. THREE MONTHS LATER Not my brother, no ! Come on, let's hear your comments about the film. Like we always do, feel free. Speak freely. Give me your creative input, come on ! I don't want any ass-lickers. I want honest comments. I won't eat you, you know me... The film's shit. He's right! The film's shit! It's crap ! And you're a jerk ! - You're my agent, say something ! - That's not true ! The screenplay is crap ! It's not clear who put the scorpion under the cushion ! Well.... it's just there ! By chance ? You're a jerk and nuts ! People hate chance happenings ! People are born, they live, die and get "I by chance. I want to know who the baddie is that put the scorpion under the pillow so we can kill the scorpion, then kill the baddie too, people will be happy, they'll eat pop-corn, give me their money, I'll buy a new boat and then you can fuck off! But Oscar, sorry... what scorpion do you mean ? Will you take your glasses off ? You have to kill yourself to protect the Italian film industry ! I'm really worried. - Really worried. - It's not a problem. Leave it to me. Andrea ? Andrea, listen. Can't we do anything to save this film ? Maybe with some editing... Fabris only used really long shots. If you cut any scene it'll make no sense. But the film can't be released like this. It's shit, you said so. It can't be distributed. Oscar and Remo will find a way. It'll be released, you'll see. - And yours and Jacaranda's careers ? - I know. The only way to stop it being released would be to access the editing suite and destroy every single copy. I'm sorry. People hate chance happenings. They're chaos, filthy sludge. And we're in a little paper boat which is sailing through the filthy sludge of the world's chaos. - Why are you in my capsule ? - Fuck off. So now you want to look youthful ? It's too late. I don't give a damn about looking youthful ! The oxygen helps me think. I need to come up with an idea to save this goddamn film. If this film is a flop, I won't cover you like I always do, and you'll be ruined ! It won't be a flop ! Don't be a jinx! The film won't be a flop ! Don't forget that if word gets out that you're cheating on me with Jacaranda, I'll take all my money, and my daughters, and send you back to where you came from. Keep the girls out of this. Or I swear I'll rip your head off! Don't let us down, Oscar. Fuck you ! Hi, Andrea. It's me. The prodigal son has returned ! Look who it is. Come here ! You beast ! I really love you ! Okay, I have something to say to you. Something I've never said before. l was wrong. That's the truth. You're smart and talented, do you understand ? How can we save this film ? Through promotion. Right, right. Promotion. We need a genius of communication. A magician who can pull a rabbit out of a top hat, like me. We need to think of a great idea, and cause a huge commotion so people won't talk about the film and they won't realise it's totally crap ! But how ? We'll have to take a huge risk. We'll behead Fabris during the press conference, l'll yell "Allah Akbar" and we'll dedicate the film to ISIS. More like this is a film about the Camorra and we'll pretend the Camorra don't want it to be released. The Camorra... The Camorra... You're a total genius. That's just what I was thinking. I thought it and you said it. We make a perfect couple ! The Camorra beheads Fabris. I like it. Oscar, no one gives a damn about Fabris, even if he dies. He's unpleasant. And Jacaranda ? You want to behead Jacaranda ? We could put a fake story in a gossip mag. Saying that she was kidnapped by gangsters. Like the Mafia, the 'Ndrangheta, the Camorra. The gossip mag news will get picked up by the newspapers, then by the TV, people will talk, get excited and flock to the box office. We'll make ten million on the first weekend. Way to go ! This goddamn piano needs tuning. It won't work ! - Why ? - When she returns, she'll give it away. It's a crap idea. I wasn't thinking that. You spoke before I thought. We need to be in sync, okay ? Unless when Jacaranda returns she says she'd switched her phone off to focus solely on her new lover. Nice, I like that. Paparazzi, gossip, we'll follow her and her lover round the city. She'll get screwed in the lift, it'll be in the papers. People will get excited, they'll want to know more. It needs to be somebody young... that nobody's heard of. Andrea... perfect. But the kidnapping by the Camorra has to be well-planned. Jacaranda has to be under shock, she has to receive threats and give statements. You're a genius ! And I discovered you. That's why I'm the best. If we do this, I want carte blanche. I'll make the decisions. You give me a budget and I'll organize everything. Partners. Partners. Stick this film about the Camorra up your ass, whore ! How many films are there about the Camorra ? Ten a year ? Nothing ever happens. And that accent doesn't sound very Neapolitan... more Serbian or Croatian. But it's obviously a threat. I'm a liability for them. I don't want my social commitment to cost me my life. - I want a body guard. - A body guard. Right. Miss, I know what actresses are like. You're sensitive, delicate creatures. But I don't think that's a genuine threat from the Camorra. Maybe it's an ex-boyfriend pulling a prank ? l'|| weigh on your conscience. And yours ! People are crazy. THE CAMORRA THREATENS THE ACTRESS JACARANDA PONTI So, is the booze flowing ? How's it going ? Countess ! My dear man ! Haven't you dumped him yet? Here he is ! Amidst the steam of the Turkish baths I didn't see you. Here she is... my star, my wonderful star! Sir, how are you ? It's the only option we have, it's the only solution. This is our extraordinary honey, made by my wife... Are you sure ? Remo will release the film all the same. Would you like some ? - No, she's allergic to honey. - If I eat it, I'll die! If she eats it, she'll die. Not that goddamn honey again ! They want to kill me ! Whenever I have a party, there's someone whose daughter wants to be an actress. So I get them all to audition together then I say: "One of you has the right connections", then they fight amongst themselves. It's hatred that makes the world go round, not love. It's gorgeous, delicious ! Here. - So, everything okay ? - Did you bring it? The SIM card's anonymous. Never use other phones, please. And don't tell me where you're taking her. I wasn't going to. So you're telling me that those disks contain all the material shot for the film ? But don't worry. We have two copies of everything. One there and one there too. And Mr Martello always keeps an updated copy of the film material in his personal safe. - Really ? - Yes. Listen, would you get me one of those honey sweets that my friend likes so much ? Sure, of course. Close it. When's it happening ? Now. You entertain your guests. Your attention please. Before we continue this wonderful party, I'd like to dedicate this evening to a very dear friend, who taught me everything I know about producing films: Pasquale Razzi. You won't know his name, but he was a man for whom two things were important: cinema and cinema. Unfortunately he died on an evening as I leant over his "toilsome papers". Pasquale, if you're here tonight, my heart is with you. Raise your glasses, please ! To Pasquale Razzi ! Get down, shitheads ! Get down ! Where is she ? Where the hell's that bitch ? Jacaranda ! What's this shit? Jacaranda, where the hell are you ? Here's Jacaranda ! Get up or I'll blow your head off! Get up! I said get up ! Let go of me ! Oscar ! I can't breathe, I can't breathe... I was starting to write this story. Listen to me, Andrea. This story is bullshit! And you and Oscar are shitheads. I want to go back to Rome ! It's not bullshit. If our strategy works, along with the promotion, the film will be a hit and our careers will be safe. You're just like Oscar. You'rejust like him. You make me sick ! - It's just for a few days. - I'm sick of this house too. I hate empty houses. PRAGUE You know why I hate empty houses ? Because when I was 7, my father killed himself. And he left us with huge debts. So then my mother had to start selling all the furniture in the house. Try to imagine it... a house slowly becoming empty. That's my earliest memory. Great opening scene for a film. That's the nicest thing anyone's ever done for me. There's some food too. Great, I'm starving ! Wait, I need to call Milly first. She'll be worried. We can't call anyone. Milly's phone will be being tapped by the police. You've been kidnapped by the Camorra, remember ? Okay. Please, return Jacaranda to us. I've seen her grow up. She's like a daughter for me. Sorry... Even the ass-licker's fallen for it. We're all set ! Oscar, you're a genius. I take back all the horrid things I said about you. This time we'll smash it for real ! I'II release it in 400 theatres ! When will you send me the copy ? Soon! Helga dear ! Helga dear ! Helga dear ! That's Zimbabwean marble ! It's porous marble, you'll wreck it with honey ! I've had a brilliant idea. I need a Camorra turncoat that'll go on TV, all pixelated, to say that his bosses are terrified of the film coming out ! Oscar, do you remember when you declared your love for me ? - No, l was drunk. - You wanted an adult relationship. "Those who truly love each other, marry out of interest, not love, because love ends, but interest doesn't". Yes. Good line, right? Very honest ! You persuaded me to marry you and use my family's money to cover your debts which then became mine too. l invested in us, darling. You can't let a nutcase ruin you now ! All I care about is the film's release ! I need a turncoat. Who's that friend of yours ? The ugly, ginger-haired midget that you always invite to dinner who never shuts up ? - Graziadei ? - Yes. - Is she still a judge ? - Yes. She must have a pixelated turncoat we can put on TV to say what we want to promote the film. I will not involve Graziadei in this for you. Why should I continue to help you ? Of course it was the family members, who else ? We're all sick of your goddamn film about the Camorra ! Why won't you put me on the case ? Because it involves Oscar Martello, who you have a personal grudge against. Why would that be ? Everyone knows he screwed your girlfriend by offering her a part. And she left you on the eve of your wedding. Don't make me say these things, I feel bad. Yes, but I won't let you doubt my professionality. My private life has never interfered with my work. So why do you keep your wedding favours on your desk ? l have another 400 in my cellar. Go on, go on ! So you have a licence for flying helicopters ? Well, maybe I fantasize a bit when I talk about my life. When you do this job, you want your life to be like a film. But in my case, it'd end in tragedy anyway. Who cares if there's a sad ending ? What matters is that it's a great story. I'm going to have a shower. Oscar Martello, did you enjoy making your film about the Camorra ? What? No one gives a damn about the Camorra. No one gives a damn about the Camorra ? In the film the Camorra is just a symbol, a metaphor for Italy. What the fuck are you saying ? Andrea talks about all our goddamn business in this film, don't you get it? That's really interesting. So the film's based on you ? Now do you get it? Gimme the gun. Now that you've got it, what shall we do, shitface ? Stop, what are you doing ? I won't release the film, what do I care ? l'|| lose a load of money, I can't die because of a film ! You have to release the film. What are you saying ? Sorry, I don't understand... Why don't you get it? Am I talking Chinese ? Let me explain it to you. All those victims, all those robberies, all the shoot-outs that are in this goddamn film are things I've told him about over the years. We have a professional relationship, to do with corpse disposal. The real author of the film is me. -So? - So pay me ! I want the money ! You're going to release this film and give it huge promotion because I want to be famous in the ghettos, understood ? No problem ! l'|| sign you up. Once I've got my investment back, you'll get a percentage. Get up and open your safe, move it. - I don't have any cash... - I said open the safe ! It's electronic ! Come on, don't be an idiot. Move it. Come on. Open it ! There. There's nothing, you see ? - Gimme that ! - It's a DCP, it's worth nothing. Why is it in the safe ? Don't move, stay there. Listen, Oscar Martello, my stories would make truckloads of films. Like when I put Ciccio the Swine into a cement mixer and turned him into tarmac. Mr Martello, the police are here. Inspector Ventura. - Here comes the cavalry. - May I ? Good morning, Mr Martello. Ah, Inspector, I'll be right with you. That's enough for this rehearsal. But it's a good start. We need to work on the dynamics of the scene because he's not very credible. We need more, what do the Neapolitans call it... "Cazzimma !" And you need to hold the gun like this. Like they do in films! We'll try next time. Forgive us, Mr Martello, if we've disappointed you. We're working on internalizing this Neapolitan metalanguage. But we want to own it and make it intrinsic, do you understand ? - I'll get my coach to help you. - Okay. So we're agreed about that thing, right? - Of course. - We'll keep these for our rehearsals. - Thanks ! Goodbye. - Great work. Have a good day. Raul Ventura ! Welcome to lncudine Films ! Oscar Martello. I know, you don't need an introduction. Your reputation precedes you. Come, let me give you a tour of the house. We'll head towards the exit. How can I help you ? I'm investigating the kidnapping of Jacaranda Ponti. You really think she was kidnapped ? The David di Donatello Award ! I didn't win it so I bought the statue ! Then I found out it's actually by Bernini. I wanted to display the price, but my wife says that's crass. Right, I see, but... going back to Jacaranda, I mean... there was a shoot-out, 4 hooded men shoved her into a truck. Do you have another name for that, if not kidnapping ? So I thought. Did you know Jacaranda had received threats ? Emperor Kamayama's Katanas. A personal gift. We were at the Tokyo Fiction Festival, which I won, and he gave them to me. Actresses... have wild imaginations ! I know. I used to know a gorgeous one. - Anna Lepori. - Never heard of her. This is the reception hall. The rest of the house was already furnished, it was simpler that way. It was a way of ennobling the Martellos, giving them a certain style. I haven't furnished this part yet. I've heard that in Cantu they can recreate the 18th century style, with solid wood that lasts longer. And this is my baby, my source of inspiration, my special moment... of solitude. 450,000 euros, it's an original Petrof. When I'm home alone, I compose and play music... I wanted to be a pianist, a composer, but I don't have time to play nor to read. So I added some software: Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven. To impress my guests. My suspicion is that you faked the kidnapping to promote a terrible film. The film isn't terrible. It's a modern film. It breaks through language, it's thought-provoking and interesting. Faking a kidnapping is a crime. "False alarm". That's a great idea. I'll keep it in mind when I get my Law degree which is something I've always wanted because I pay a dozen lawyers shitloads yet they do fuck all ! You have 19 homes, 13 more assigned to your wife and 2 to NPOs. Are you sure Jacaranda isn't in one of those ? I don't know ! I don't know who's in Paris, or London... Jacaranda's agent received a call that was made from Prague where you have a lovely apartment. Yes, but how do I know whether my friends bring home actresses or whores ? I see you understand... Who's used your houses recently ? Listen, I'm a generous man. If a friend wants a house, they come here, take the keys and off they go. How convenient ! Can I be your friend ? Just do as I say and stop bugging me. - Do you need the toilet before you go ? - No. Say hi to your boss, we're good friends ! - You mean Chief Inspector Mutti ? - No, the Home Secretary. Vincenzo ! What's his fucking name ? Vittorio ! What's your goddamn name ? I need a copy of the film ! Franco ! No, Matteo ? What's your fucking name ? I need a copy of the film within two hours. Sir, there's been a slight hitch. I didn't tell you because I'm trying to resolve things. What's there to resolve ? film's data... has been lost. I'll kill you ! Hands off! What the fuck did you do ? - Who the fuck was it? - I don't know! - I just know that... - Who was it ? I can't retrieve the data, sir. I'm sorry ! Stop, keep still ! Hello ? Oscar, when will you send me the goddamn copy ? Soon ! Very soon ! We're working on the finishing touches. We're doing some really great work ! It won't be long now ! Don't worry ! Dickhead, l'|| recycle you in a Chinese restaurant. l'|| chop you to pieces, shithead ! You've got two hours. Two hours ! Then I'll bury you alive in here ! Prague. Jerk ! Where the hell are you ? I shouldn't tell you. Did you take her to my place in Prague ? You're a total dickhead ! They've traced your calls. They'll pin this on me ! I didn't know this'd happen ! But you write detective stories, moron ! Bring her back here now ! Cut her ear off and bring her back to Rome ! The film's promotion has a clear strategy, we have to see this through. Goddamn corpse-cleaners ! I love everything about Prague ! I like... the rooftops in Prague, the sandwiches in Prague, the Starbucks in Prague ! Starbucks is the same all over the world. But here they're surrounded by Prague ! You're a good cook too ! Why can't I fall in love with a guy like you ? No, I'd better not. I'm not a good girl. I'm just... a mediocre actress. Show me what it'd be like. - Meaning ? - If you were in love with me. You know, just pretend. I've fallen in love with you, Andrea... Because with you... I can be myself. And I can forget about all the rest. And... because you were right, I needed to leave Rome. And because you... Because you are pure. And you saved me. From what ? From Oscar. You don't know, but it was him who killed Pasquale Razzi. He killed him with some cocaine that was cut with rat poison. I was there, I saw the whole thing. He'd drugged me to make me... To make me do it with them both and... and him... and that other bastard Remo Golia threatened me, they told me to keep quiet and to not say anything. And I trusted them. He promised we'd do some films... I was stupid. And I don't even know why... why I love him so much. Let's sleep. Listen up ! Goddamn shitty writer ! You know what you're gonna do ? Without even getting dressed, you're going to Rome to find the last remaining copy of the film that your goddamn gangster friends nicked from me. Or I'll rip your bollocks off. Is that clear ? Why is there only one copy left? Because somebody broke into the editing suite to destroy everything. Wretched girl. Let's go. I'm not going back to Rome. Who said we're going back to Rome ? I meant let's go away. Forgive me. I shouldn't have waited this long... To run away with you. You know what we'll do ? We'll do what you've always dreamt of doing. We'll go back to Rome, we'll go to Eur, and we'll paint a moustache on Alberto Sordi's statue. And then we'll leave that horrid city for good. But first... we have to promote the film. So it'll be a huge success and make loads of money. I knew it. You only care about the film. We can't go back now. It would be obvious that it was all faked. You don't need to worry about what will happen. I'll take responsibility for your fuck-ups. The only thing you need to think about is: "Find the copy of the film." "Find the copy of the film." Otherwise you'll be a corpse and someone else will wash you down. You're the one who said we have to see things through. How dare you speak to me like that ! How dare you speak to me like that ! Weren't you one for taking risks ? Turn right. Follow the river. There she is, pull over! Pull over! Jacaranda ! Stop ! - Please ! - Go away. - Leave me alone ! Let go ! - Calm down ! You're a piece of shit! What kind of man have you become ? Why did you marry that woman ? Just to become the shitty producer that you are ? Well, you succeeded ! You don't give a damn about me, so do me a favour and go away ! Come here ! Stop ! One moment... Listen, we're releasing 500 copies of this film in Italy. l'|| transfer the takings to an overseas account. And we can be together again. There's something else too. If I go back to Rome, it's to do one thing alone. I'm going to report you and that other bastard Remo Golia, for Razzi... The girl said she'll go to the police. Okay. Leave me alone ! Let go ! - Let go ! - Keep still ! Go to the airport. I won't let my little paper boat sink in the filthy sludge of the world's chaos. Do you think it's too much ? It's her birthday. How old is she ? - Seven, or eight? - Eight! Let her have some fun ! She can get depressed later ! Fiore ! The cake ! Let's hear it for our Aventino rapper ! Cleo Martello ! If it's not good, I'll rip your head off! Forgive the intrusion, Mr Martello. I'm here to question you as you're a person of interest in this case. - What case ? - The case concerning Miss Ponti's death. Her body was found in the Vltava, in Prague, this morning. Suicide, it seems. The media haven't been informed yet. She died last night and flight records show that you were in Prague. Did you see Jacaranda ? You two had a relationship. A normal actress-producer relationship. What's this ? Phone records from your cell phones for the past six months. They often used the same cell tower, even late at night. How do you explain that? Casual sex. But you just said you had normal actress-producer relationship. Exactly. The wounds on the body could have been caused as it floated or following a struggle. It's my duty to investigate. Everyone. Listen, I didn't tell you about my relationship with Jacaranda because my wife's next door. I'm married. Are you married ? No ! I was stood up at the altar. Well, lucky you. Am I a suspect? You don't seem bothered about her death. But I think you're pretending. You were very fond of Jacaranda, right? Don't be fooled by appearances. I mean, you don't look very smart. Dad, I won the talent show, I got four "yes" votes ! Well done, darling. Dad... you ate my face ! No, darling... Come here... I'll buy you another one. I'll buy you ten cakes. Don't cry ! I'm arresting you, Mr Martello. I trust you will cooperate with us as we take you to the station where you will explain how you got those scratches on your neck. You didn't call me. Where were you last night? At my mother's house, in Monaco, like every Tuesday. It's a three-hour drive from Prague. Did you kill her ? Who ? Jacaranda. You know how much I've spent promoting this film ? Over a million euros. Now it seems the film is with friends of yours. This film is set to make 20 million euros at the box office. And now that that bastard Oscar has been arrested... in connection with Jacaranda's murder... - What ? - Yes, Jacaranda's dead. And if Oscar killed her, he did the right thing ! Now what I need to know is who else will I have to kill to get this damn film ? Who else... Fiore was in Prague. Did you kill her ? I haven't killed anyone. Not yet. Just saying... I have something to show you. You don't know, but it was him who killed Pasquale Razzi. IT DOESN'T END HERE Make 800 copies of the film, not 400. 800. Lello ? I used to go outwith an actress. When she left me, I read the biographies of 300 actresses. All those who killed themselves did it at the end of their careers. Since the days of the Lumiére brothers, none... killed themselves as a film was being released. It'd be a first. Inspector... We're waiting for the autopsy report from Prague. But I am certain... that we'll find traces of your DNA under the fingernails. I have no proof of the motive, but I'm very optimistic. Killing a young girl... to promote a film. - How fucked-up ! - I didn't kill her! I threatened her, blackmailed her, pushed her down stairs, beat her, but I didn't kill her! That's how we expressed our love ! But I didn't kill Jacaranda ! There's a visitor for Mr Martello, his lawyer. See you later. Why are you here ? Did you do it ? We loved each other. We loved each other. This just arrived from Prague's Murder Squad. At that time, Martello was on a plane. Why the fuck are you here ? He's not lying. I need the password to your secret account. My friends want the money before they return the film. Help! Help! This isn't my lawyer! - Oscar... - This isn't my lawyer! The film must be released. At least for her. Shit! Hold it right there, bastard ! Get in ! You piece of shit, get in ! Thanks, guys. It's always a pleasure. Andrea, buddy ! How are you ? Everything okay ? Did that hurt ? It's my rings. Andrea, what the fuck should we do with this thing ? Do you have our money ? Tonight ! Tonight, at the film's presentation, at Oscar's house. Oscar ? But he's been arrested ! No ! The presentation's going ahead. Tonight ! Should we trust him ? Damn you ! All right. You were on a plane when Jacaranda was walking by the river. We have film footage that shows Andrea Serrano looking for Jacaranda. And we intercepted calls between him and the gangster Lello Jovine. What kind of relationship do they have ? Canlgo? For me it always feels like the first time. If I weren 't so lucky... because I've been really lucky ! Thank God I'm not like my character. You're cheating on me even now that she's dead ? I'm working... I'm trying to put together some clips to keep our guests entertained tonight. Hurry up, the party's about to begin. There are... 500 movie theatres waiting for... the release of our latest masterpiece. And when... a film is released, the first thing we ask ourselves is: how much money will it make ? Actually... this film... will probably... never be released. It won't be released ? What's he saying ? Silence ! would like to dedicate this special evening to a great artist, a woman who was... extraordinarily beautiful... I will let these images tell you the story of this great actress: Jacaranda Ponti. Great, it's really great! It's wonderful ! That's why we do this job, right ? Call HQ. See if the goddamn autopsy report has arrived. If I weren 't so lucky... because I've been really lucky... I think I'd have given up. You know how much money the film will make now that Jacaranda's dead ? Why the fuck are you here ? I came to save the film. How will you do that ? Starting with this. Ever wondered why your man spends so much time with Remo ? Remo ! You've been spying on me. I always told you to be careful about the company you keep. I've known you for thirty years. You piece of shit. I'm glad Oscar gave you another chance. He must trust me. Milly... Fabris ! Oscar wants you. He mentioned a sequel. Way to go ! - Fabris ? Will I see you later ? - Yes, yes. Andrea, what do you want? To get revenge for Jacaranda. I was supposed to trust you. Trust you ? How could I trust you, seeing that you were screwing Jacaranda ? It's a secret... And you saved me. From what ? From Oscar. You don't know, but it was him who killed Pasquale Razzi. He killed him with cocaine cut with rat poison. How fucked up ! I was there, saw the whole thing. He'd drugged me to make me... to make me do it with them both and... and him, and... that other bastard Remo Golia threatened me. They told me to keep quiet, and to not say anything. And I trusted them. Here it is, it's the autopsy report. He promised we'd make some films. What are you all staring at? What's there to fucking stare at ? Call for back-up. Now ! Bastards ! Get the hell out of here ! Let's go, girls. We're going to grandma's. Helga ! It's over ! Get yourself a lawyer ! Helga ! I took you in from the streets... and that's where you'll return. You and I made a pact. But you've humiliated me ! You're dead. Where's the copy of the film ? Where's our money ? Do you have something from Remo ? This is better than your money. A contract. Making you co-writer of the screenplay and named in the opening credits and you'll get a percentage of the takings. Trust me, this film will make money. Here. Did you spell my name correctly ? Pasqualino Jovine. Good. Shame that Jacaranda has revolutionised your life now that she's dead. What the fuck do you know ? I have a soft spot for actresses. It's a topic I studied at length. You're mad at me because you think I screwed... What was her fucking name... Anna Lepori. Anna Lepori ! For fuck's sake ! One of the least talented women I've ever goddamn met ! I would have screwed her, but... I happened to lose her number. You think I'm here for personal reasons ? I'm here because you're a criminal and I'm a cop, that's how it works. Anna and l are good friends now. It wasn't your fault that it didn't work out. Great plot twist, right ? Now put that goddamn sword down. Come on, let's go ! It's what I always say to my screenwriters. What's the goddamn point of knocking down the Twin Towers when you could just lift the pillow to check if a scorpion's there ? I found it, you know. Anaphylactic shock. Jacaranda was allergic to honey and in the house there was a jar with Oscar Martello's fingerprints on it. You left her to die while you were on the plane ! How fucked-up ! I said let's go ! Fuck you ! Let's go ! Oscar ! Come on, let's go ! The problem is... working out... who put the scorpion there. The honey... You put it there. And you fucked me over. No, you killed her, Oscar. The problem is that everyone knows you're a bastard. You never thought I could lie. The film is shit. The film is shit. The film isn't that bad. It'll go down well. The only way to stop its release is to access the editing suite and destroy all the copies. THE FILM IS SHIT Who put the scorpion under the pillow, Oscar ? The baddie. Who in the end... dies. To achieve beauty you need to take risks. And have a strategy. What the fuck do you do ? ALLERGIC TO HONEY What's your strategy ? We need someone young that nobody's heard of. What we need is in his safe. Isn't this way better than the idea that everything happened by chance ? Jacaranda's agent received a call from a cell tower in Prague. They traced your calls, they'll pin this on me. I didn't know this'd happen ! I didn't know that'd happen ! Did I have to come to Prague to get screwed over by you ? Rome burns, Rome burns Rome burns, Rome burns With the Christians ! Come here... you immature shithead. Where the fuck did you learn to fight like that ? Fuck you ! It's over, Oscar. You'll either die or go to jail. Give me the password. What a shitty writer you are ! You should've worked it out. Fuck you ! I'm afraid there's no sign of the body, inspector. Maybe it was cremated, who knows ! Everything okay ? Thanks. Do me a favour. Don't leave town for the next two weeks. Don't worry, inspector. l have no intention of leaving this city. Good. Bye. Where's the car ? Over there, let's go. DOLCEROMA TRANSFER MONEY TRANSFER COMPLETE Following the events connected with the release of "It Doesn't End Here ", the death of Jacaranda Ponti and the disappearance of Oscar MarteIIo, the film continues to be a box office hit for the fifth week running, with takings of over 40 million euros. And today we have another report. The famous distributor Remo Golia has been arrested for alleged involvement in the murder of Pasquale Razzi. The investigation will continue until we have brought all the culprits to justice. And now, some breaking news... The statue of Alberto Sordi has been vandalised, perhaps by a prankster, who broke into the private grounds where it is located, and a moustache has now appeared on the face of Italy's most famous film star! Why the hell are you in Hollywood ? You're in the wrong place, the future is Bollywood ! A market of two and a half billion people. My next project: "The Betrothed". She'll be Indian, he'll be Chinese. It'll be epic ! Mr Martello will definitely leave his mark this time. I also have a new female protagonist you might like. you shit.
