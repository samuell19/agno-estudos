Oh, is that you, Ma'am? Yes, it is I'll let you know Yes, give me a call Have a safe trip Yes Mr. Han Congratulations Thank you. Please be kind on the review Mr Han, Get home safely It was unbelievably successful Everything is sold. All of them except Natal You were fabulous today Oh, that guy called again He said he was in your class in college Class of '97, he said. I told him that if he wanted to see you so much, he should just come by sometime Should I tell him not to come? No, let him Are you going to sell Natalie? The journalists are wondering who Natali's real model is Hello. My name is Jang Min Woo Hello I'm here to see professor Hwang. Is he here? What is it about? Hum. I think I have told you that I would like to purchase Natali I'm sorry to say, but I don't think that will happen Why not? Why do you want her so badly? Because I also have a secret my own What secret? The exhibition is over Professor Hwang Jun-hyuk? Yes, I am Hello. I'm Jang Min-woo I was moved by your work Wait, wait Would you let me write a review on your work? You want to write about my work? I don't even know you No, wait. Professor, I was one of your students In art school, class of '97 Natalie I would like to hear more about Natali Don't you dare touch it What do you want to hear about Natalie? I can feel her spirit It's as if she's alive And it seems she is waiting for someone Who the hell are you? Tell me about her The real person Who is the real Natali? Are you asking the difference between reality and art? I'm asking about the real model behind Natalie Hey, this work of art and the model have nothing in common Are you saying that Natalie was created on its own? I am not sure if you have a theme of this review My theme is on Natalie Just have some tea Don't even dream about writing about my work We actually don't need permission from anyone to write art reviews Jang Min-woo, or Jung Min-woo. Whatever your name is My name is Jang Min-woo Mr. Jang, you put down of other people's work to make a living So, you want me to give you something to gossip about? People like you don't deserve to exist in this world Stop threatening other people and do something more creative I agree on that, but who will write about your great work of creation then? If it wasn't for me, your rocks... Did you just say rocks? No, I meant your work would be valued simply by its weight and nothing else Don't be surprised this is just a piece of rock, just like you said In your eyes, what does it look like? A turtle or an elephant? Do you know the difference between a sculptor and a stonecutter? If he thinks as he cuts, he's a sculptor On the other side, a stonemaker cut for work and not for art What about the one who made inscriptions on your ancestor's headstones? Is he a sculptor or a stonecutter? Well... Do you think you know what art is? Can you look at the nature of objects? No But Professor I don't think you can see the nature of women either Ah Are we talking about curator Park? What? Did she criticize me? Are you afraid of other people's criticism? No. Whatever she says is not important to me Why is that? Because she is in love with me Well... What do you know about me and curator Park? Well, if she loved you, she wouldn't call you such as a sex fiend Young man One poet once said that love is a bitch Do you want to sleep with her? The world consists of two parts: men and women. It's like yin and yang, so to speak She loved my work at first, then she got attached physically but I just know once having her in my bed She's just a bit angry at me because she can't have me She knows there's another woman in my heart A well known, but madly ill-mannered sculptor and a curator who needs his work She could have been faking an orgasm Yeah? Anyways, she forgets while we have sex When the sex is over, She is angry again Do you have sex with only one woman? Talk to me I'm curious about you Are you married? You must be married. You must love your wife very much How would you know all that? You wouldn't even cheat. You don't look like the type Stop it. Do you think I am an idiot? No. You look too serious. In fact, disgustingly sincere Not all men have to fool around like you do Come on! That's a given in this country Motels outnumber churches in this country Do you know how the motel owners make a living? Yes, honey. I'm at the office Huh? It's just a headache Gotta go for a meeting. Talk to you later A married woman sends her husband to work in the morning as usual Have you ever had sex with a woman at 11am overlooking the river? Do you believe in monogamy? What you see isn't all truth It's becoming a world of polygamy. Adultery is simply a word from the past Is your wife at home as she says? Or is she with another man in a bed Don't you want to know the truth? Please, don't apply your experience to everyone else's There are many people in this world who live with love and truth Why was it that a King had 3000 concubines in his palace back then? Do you want to be a king? I'm just a sculptor Ten years ago, after your last exhibition Didn't you say that you won't create or release any more work? I did say that What made you change your mind? I don't ask you to understand a fickle minded artist What is the reason that you released to the press your ten year old work, Natali? It's the gallery's marketing planning. That's what they do I know someone who'd like to purchase Natali at the highest price I'm just not And why is that? Just don't want to I'll buy it I doubt you can afford it Yes, I know very well. Kan Yakumari was $10,000 Sitalie was $20,000. Kali was $30,000 Gauri, the goddess that nurtures all lands was priced at $50,000 Oh, that's impressive. You're smarter than Curator Park So, how much are you going to sell Natalie for? I'm afraid this is not a grocery market where you can buy anything Of course not, I value your work. I will pay Can you afford it? Yes. I have enough I don't think you have earned enough yet at your age Did you inherit a lot? Just give me the price It's impossible to estimate its value And your other work can? In that sense, I feel bad for them Anyway, I won't sell Natal There's a special story behind Natalie OK, then. It really is hard dealing with a stubborn artist Thank you for taking your time You... Why are you so obsessed with Natalie, anyway? You didn't come in here for an art review, did you? Do you know Natali? Tell me! Do you know who Natali is? Huh? Before I answer this Tell me who you think Natali is I'll tell you who Natalie is This Natalie is me. It's me, Hyo-rim Park Curator Park, do you really think that Natalie is you? You can never be Natal Then, you played with me to make this piece of metal? You son of a bitch What you're holding is the woman I love I wanted to create the most beautiful woman in the world I'll get ready Curator Park was also part of my inspiration But nothing or nobody could truly help me They were all just useless and obvious imitations Days turned into months I simply couldn't do anything Stunning body movements mixed with mortal seduction Right after that moment, She invaded my life completely Until now, in various art work, sculptures and construction projects have been used in various ways Even the Egyptian pyramids were built using this golden proportion Especially symbols and figures She excited me to recreate her through my hands 'Art and our desire towards it Because human beings can't exist forever we live with the dilemma we dream of eternity So we desire to capture the beauty at the peak of it We always desire to be more beautiful I believe that every art piece begins from this Do you understand? OK, that's all Thank you You have a nice vacation, too. Professor, please get married this year Professor? Yes? Would you sign this to celebrate the end of the semester? Autograph? Sure What's your name? Don't you know my name? Pardon? It's Mi-ran. Oh Mi-ran Alright, Mi-ran What should I write for you? I want you What? Write "I want you" OK, then "I want you" I want to be your model That's ridiculous You're telling me that she seduced you first? Yes, it was seduction. A seduction nobody could refuse The Mi-ran I know is not that type of girl I decided to be bold with her seduction If you're ready, shall we get started? Yes You don't have to take off the skirt Would you go up there and sit down? Wait Try to be steady Just relax Hold on a second The more we did the bolder she became That's how our love started becoming stronger than anyone else's in this world She made me excited over and over We made love again and again We didn't want to stop, I could have died with her. When I made love to her Don't lie to me Stop interrupting That makes no sense at all! Please. Every moment with her is still vivid to me Why did you break up with her then? Why didn't you just marry her? We didn't break up We swore that we would love each other forever We truly wanted our love to be eternal If you love someone, do you have to marry that person? You're making all this up The Mi-ran I know isn't some easy woman! To me, she's pure and mysterious, as if she came from a mythical tale She's a creation who looks as if she jumped out of a painting Human beings will have to face death eventually we live with the dilemma that we dream of eternity So we desire to capture the beauty at the peak of it We always desire to be more beautiful Every art piece begins from this That's all for this semester. Good work everyone Hey, excuse me! Excuse me! Me? You're in a dance major, right? Yes, what's up? I saw you dancing before Okay I want to draw you dancing Why would you want to draw me? Because you're special Special? That sounds nice. Wait Professor Yes? Would you sign this to celebrate the end of the semester? Sure What's your name? Mi-ran. Oh Mi-ran, right? Yes Here Thank you "I want you" Can we talk? Just for a minute I was just wondering if you'd be my model It's nothing too difficult Could you hold on a second? It won't take too long It's nothing to be afraid of You took her away in the dirtiest way You put her in the corner with a dirty trick You destroyed her with this disgusting excuse you call 'art' Why don't you just write a novel? Huh? You are distorting the past in order to beautify your work I think you are the one who is twisted out of the memories That's not true Well, I can relate to you You loved Miran but couldn't have her all The jealousy towards me with the desire for her your memories could be completely twisted You can say whatever you want. But you can't avoid the fact So you fooled her completely for your own good Shut up! If you loved her to the death, How could you leave her? I said I didn't leave her! Was she too much to handle since she was too young? Or you slept with a young student impulsively. But felt sorry for her suddenly? Professor Did you do well on your exam? Yes Hello, Professor Just a minute I've missed you Should we go get something to eat? I was worried didn't get the letters yet When did you leave it there? About a week ago? Why aren't you saying anything else? You agree with me, don't you? I won't deny what you're saying But that wasn't the problem Age wasn't a problem for us either As time went by, we only sought physical pleasure Professor, aren't you getting married? A son and a daughter. They look happy Why do you think people get married and have babies? That's because a man has met an overly determined woman When a man marries, it's because he's met the most cruel and spiteful woman on earth No way, then is your mother one of them? How about we just live together? We don't need marriage I don't want to crawl in a grave of love because of tradition and convenience Well, Mi-ran, it may not be easy for you to understand now The lust for a woman reborn through my work, I naturally fall in love with the woman But on the other hand, I couldn't see the passion in my work. It started to diminish I got addicted to her continuously and so did she How's Natali? Ten years later, I would compare myself to Natali She promised me she would come back ten years later and left me I blamed myself for not being able to hold her back So, you ended up leaving Mi-ran Are you expecting her to appear today looking like an angel? Then, why isn't she here? Your love just lingers in your fantasy You are irresponsible immature person who can't break into reality Mi-ran might have forgotten you Love might just end before it reaches a decade Don't interpret it for your own convenience You... Why are you still obsessed with your one-sided love from the past? I probably think I was the only hope for miserable Miran after you left her I couldn't see Miran even when she completely came to me Do you think you know her better than I do? I know her very well Since she's my wife What? A wife! I've been looking for you since last week. What's going on with you? Do you love me? Yes Really? Even though someone else is in my heart, can you still love me? Yes Forever? Yes, forever She promised eternal love This is ridiculous When I was at a loss in sorrow She did eat, sleep and have sex with you Why the hell did you come to me? Why did you? If you didn't come, I would have been missing her for the rest of my life Did she send you or did she ask you to bring Natali? Get out of my face now Give Natalie to me No. I can't do that She's my wife Natali is just one of the easy women that I have spent a night with Does it make you feel better to objectify Natali in a cheap and shameful way? Yes, I should give away that meaningless steel to someone That's enough Tell your wife, that my past, my work, my promises I take it all back, and I regret everything I wouldn't be able to Go and tell her. Don't leave out a single word Natalie is a dirty and cheap whore. You hear me? That's enough. I won't deliver a single word you said Why? Why won't you? Why? Why? Why? Because... Mi-ran... Mi-ran... is gone Mi-ran, Oh Mi-ran! How could you say that? Oh Mi-ran No, this is my first baby. I'm going to have it This would kill you Honey, please... No, I can't let you. If I don't have you, I'll die We can always have another baby Who's going to die? I won't. I will be fine Mi-ran wanted to have Ye-rim. If we had aborted her, Mi-ran could've lived In the end, as Mi-ran wanted, we stopped Chemo treatment And we were able to have our healthy daughter, Yerim Are you all right? Yeah Come here, Ye-rim Mi-ran had ovarian cancer After she had Yerim the cancer spread all over her body so we couldn't do nothing about it But I think Miran was not afraid Are you awake, baby? I'm fine Hold me tight You know, the doctor said I can have sex That's what he said I'm sorry Honey I love you What? I said I love you Me too. I love you, too I had no idea Natali must be meaningful than any of your work for you Can you forgive me? Please Forgive me. Please Mi-ran... Tried to keep her words to you until the end She waited for you until the very last moment Right before she passed away I found this out by accident Why, why did you do this? Why! She missed you Until the last moment This is the letter she left for you We have to see each other I don't think I can keep my promise seeing you after ten years from now If I could see you just once. I want to say this to you Do you know what she was going to tell me? No, I am curious too. That's why I came to see you You said you have a daughter Will you bring her sometime? I missed you It doesn't matter what she was going to say In the way as I always wanted to I will love you Miran Even though it will take an eternity I will come to you Hope this mail box will take me to you Miran
