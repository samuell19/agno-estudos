She was standing in a king's court, wearing a shawl. - Guess it. - A girl. So funny! Girl? I don't know. - You say. - Corn. - Yes, corn. - Corn fine. Now you two guess the riddle. A girl was going on a camel. And a man was holding the rein. A passer-by asked... O camel rider... how are you related to this man? She says... I won't take his name. But my name is Jiya. His mother-in-law and my mother-in-law... are mother and daughter. Now you guess it. How? His mother-in-law and my mother-in-law... are mother and daughter. - Can I answer? - Sure. Her father-in-law. - Right. - No. How is it possible? Yes. His mother-in-law and my mother-in-law... are mother and daughter. Now calculate it. Understood? She won't understand. One more?

I am going to my sister's village for 2 days. - Okay. After getting free from there... I will find a new voice. Now this is the most important job for you. - Okay? - Consider it done. - Okay. - Thank you, sir. "Here, miracles hide behind the clouds to surprise you."

At least bring water. - Hello, brother. - Hello. - How are you? - Fine. - Hello. - Hello. - He is Sardar Baghel Singh. - Hurry up, girl. - He is my wife's cousin from Delhi. - Okay. Please come. - Mewa. - Yes? - Go and bring a cot. - Okay, brother. Aunt, hello. God bless you, son. Bijit had a daughter again. Yes, aunt. That's too bad. - Keep it here. - It's all God's will. True. Your mother didn't come to visit me. One of our buffaloes is expecting. She is busy with her since 4-5 days. May God have mercy! May you get a healthy female calf. Please come. Sit. Come on. Yesterday I was taking a stroll... near Ram Singh's house. Your daughters were humming. It was amazed! I never imagined finding such great artists, in this village. Well, I came to make a request about it. If these girls sing a song for our album, then our album will be very successful. I came to seek permission for that. What are you saying, sir? We neither imagined nor heard such a thing. We are simple landowners. For us brotherhood and modesty means everything. Sir... times have changed. Society is changing. Girls are progressing ahead. They too are equal to boys. Nothing is going to come out of it. You tell me, will you have flat bread with mustard or a carrot dish? Mother. Mother, can I ask something? Why did father refuse him? - For what? - For our singing. - Jassi, bring the dried clothes. - Okay. Go and help her. We will do it later, first you listen to us. What? Don't nag me. About our singing. Keep the bed sheets on the shelves. I won't go. You don't listen to me. You are silly. You talk like a mad person. This is not possible. Why not? We sing at home also. Nobody objects to that. There is a difference between singing here and there. That's what we are asking. What's the difference? You don't wear a veil at home. But don't you wear a veil when you go out? That's the difference. You are making an excuse. Youth have a passion for singing. I too had it. My mother used to beat me for singing. Oh! You should consider yourself lucky. My foot! So? Does the passion die after getting beaten up? Let's go cook, sister. - Let's go. - Hold this. Fold the clothes. Come on. - You do it. - You do it. Pull it. Harder. Harder. Pull it. It won't budge, brother. Hello, village-head. Hello, sir. Has the tractor broken down? Yes, we are trying to fix it. If you want to go the village, get in. I am also going there. You carry on. We will bring it later. - Shall I go? - Yes. Let's go. Fine, I will come with you. - Brother, ask Pachuri about irrigation. - Okay. - Let's pull once again. - Yes, come on. Yes, come on. - Yes now pull. - Come on, pull harder. Brother Sher Singh, Music is not a bad thing. We are having music in our temples. We play music when a child is born. Music's played in every wedding. In fact, music's played during funerals also. Mr Baghel Singh is a connoisseur. He must have looked for something good in our daughters... and that's why he is insisting. He don't entertain useless people. I am sure, he will make our daughters sing... only good songs. Exactly. It will be traditional. It will be full of love. Chief. We have been living together our whole life. We have similar families. Our lifestyle is the same. We have same kind of thinking. If you like this thing... then there's no point in me denying. Okay, they will sing. All right. But the thing is... Our daughters won't be photographed. Their names will not be published. And they will never be leaving the home. Mister, I agree all of your terms, but... it's hard to record the song in this village. In Nabha, Kulhari Market... I have an ancestral home. It will easier for me to do the recording over there. And like I am uncle to his children... the girls can think... they are going to their uncle's place. Sounds okay, brother. Okay then. Thanks. Welcome. I am so pleased. - Greetings - Greetings, greetings. Come. - Greetings. - Greetings. - Greetings. - Greetings. - Come inside, sir. - Dear, come. - Greetings. - How are you? Master, here are the goddesses of music. Make them practice. "What will I do with the golden chamber and colourful windows?" "What will I do with the golden chamber and colourful windows?" "Whenever I feel so, I shall look into your eyes to rejoice." "What will I do with the golden chamber and colourful windows?" "I've the needle and thread ready." "I've even cleansed my feet." "I've the needle and thread ready." "I've even cleansed my feet." "We will make a mud house," "And then like a peacock we'll dance in love, and God will bless us with rain." "What will I do with the golden chamber and colourful windows?" Mother. Where have you put it? Why do you pack everything? Check it there. Look with my eyes. It is there only. Can't you see? I have got it. Roop, this is it. It has a song in it. It's sung very beautifully. From the day uncle has gave me this, I am listening to it only. Your singing is no match to it. Just listen. Oh Gulab. These flowers have bloomed so well. There bloom here only. My uncle has the same flowers, but they don't bloom there. "I've the needle and thread ready." It's beautiful. "I've even cleansed my feet." "I've the needle and thread ready." "I've even cleansed my feet." "We will make a mud house," "And then like a peacock we'll dance in love, and God will bless us with rain." "What will I do with the golden chamber and colourful windows?" Roop, no! Leave me. Take it. Oh Raja. Get us another helping, please. There is one thing. Raja cooks tasty chicken. That's true. He cooks really well. I am enjoying eating it. The chicken itself has enjoyed it when it got cooked. If I become a chicken in my next life... I want to be cooked by him. Why are you waiting for your next life, brother? He can cook donkeys too. - Come on, brother. - Sher Singh. Just listen to me, son. Coming, aunt. Excuse me. Okay, go. It's really tasty. - The drinks are too good. - Awesome. Greetings, aunt. May you live long, son. Sher Singh, don't you want to get your daughter married? I want to get her married, aunt. Why not? The guy who is sitting here, Kabil Singh... - Yes? - He's Amritsar. - He is my nephew. - Okay. He has a son. He has 50 acres of land. His family is like your family. They have a concrete house. - She won't be needing anything. - Really? Is it? She is your granddaughter, aunt. If you like it, then we like it too. - Okay, let me call him. - Sure. Kabil Singh. Yes, aunt. Come here for a minute. Coming, aunt. Just a minute. Chief's bluffing. - I am thinking that it's a long game. - Possible. -- It's so good. - Yes, it is. Okay so we all be here next year. All these men will be here. And Raja will cook meat. We will celebrate your third grandson's birth. Same bottle too. Same bottle, but not the same booze. It will get over right away. Come on, then! Order four more bottles. It's time for double celebration. We have become relatives now. - Wonderful. Congratulations. - Same to you. - Congratulations. Congratulations. - Congratulations. Son, Wasn't it your duty to discuss it with us? You should have informed us. You just consented to the alliance. Mother, I couldn't think of anything. Aunt said the family is very nice. I agreed. How would you think? You were high after drinking booze. I was high, not aunt. She should have talked about it, after careful deliberation. My foot! You should have asked us. You've fixed your daughter's alliance with paupers. Brother, alcohol is ruining you. - You should control yourself. - Come here, dear. Wonderful, as if it has no effect on you. Sher, to tell you the truth... I don't feel like sending my daughter so far away. Just the thought of it makes my heart pine. Mother, I made a mistake. But now I can't go back on my word. I have promised in front of ten men. It's not a big deal. Go and tell them we won't send our daughter so far. No, sister-in-law. We can't give such a reply. Brother will lose face. He will be humiliated in the village. - Mother. - Yes, dear. Do I have to go so far? I don't want to go away from you. Dear, you had to leave us some day. But why so far? I have to take a train to get there. I have to cross two rivers. Dear, are you scared of train? It's not about the train. Do you know Kartar's aunt Charno? She got married so far. It's been ten years. She has not come back. Neither in joy nor in sorrow. - It's better you kill me. - No, dear. It will be like I am dead for you. No, my daughter. Don't talk like that. Don't say that, my darling daughter. No, dear. Do you hear me? Coming. Roop is my daughter. I too don't like it when she cries. Outside the walls of this house... you women don't know the value of a promise. My promise is like my ancestors' promise. I can die, but I can't break my promise. Don't be disheartened. I will try to convince Roop. Okay. Wait here. I'll be right back. Okay. Baghel Singh, please lead the way. Follow me. Sir, I can't repay Baghel Singh's favour. He has given such good artists to our company. God does everything. I am just a medium. But... sir, I must say something. That in the last several years... no song was played so much on radio... as this song of ours. The girls' voices are magical. Goddess Saraswati has blessed them. Sir has been insisting since that day... that we want these girls to sing five songs of one album. Yes, yes. I said... you should talk to Sardar Sher Singh. No, sir. Now it's not possible. You all insisted, that's why I gave permission for one song. You are wise. You know our family. You know our lifestyle. We can't ask our girls to sing songs like this. Look, this world is full of trials and tribulations. If someone hears a sweet voice... and it brings joy in his life for a few moments... isn't it a noble deed? No, sir. Please drop the topic here. What's the point of discussing something we aren't interested in? Will you have something else? No, thanks. We brought sweets for the girls. Please accept them. - Jassi. - Yes. Take the boxes inside. I will open it I will open it I will open it. I will open it - I am elder than you. - Give it to me. Sweetmeats. Sweetmeats? Sister, money. How much are these? Maybe a kilo. The box is made to contain a kilo. Hmm. Sister, is this our reward? Of course. Sister, will you give us too? No, you are still too young. You start hogging like there is no tomorrow. You have no manners! - What is it? - We got money. You fool! Don't you have brains? Give it here. Have some shame. Wait, let me tell your father. - Listen? - Come. Look what they gave with the sweets? Oh, my God! He threw so much money. Rani, you take them. No, my husband will beat me... asking where I got the money from. Greetings, aunt. God bless you. Son, when do I call them for the engagement? Aunt, don't worry. I will tell you. Let me discuss with my mother and my wife. Okay, tell me soon. Winter is coming. Roop. I have come to ask for something. Please don't refuse. Yes? Please give consent for that alliance. It's a matter of your father's honour. I am doing it for your own wellbeing. You can ask for anything in return. But say yes. Uncle, can I tell you what sister wants? What? Give us permission to sing one more time. She will say yes. Did I tell you? You came up with it yourself. Sister, I understand what's in your heart. You know nothing. Basant, then ask your sister again. If she wants, I give my permission. When uncle brought the gramophone... I used to wonder... can our songs will ever be played on this record. I too used to think. When I was small, I heard an aunt say... that girls don't dream. Because a girl's dream never come true. But at least one of our dreams is coming true. There will be an album of our songs. If I consent for the wedding... will father take a year to get me married? Yes, sister. It will take one year. So I have one year. I will make a deal with my life. I will dedicate my life to music for a year. Then I will surrender my fate to God. Even the moon and the stars have surrendered their fate to God. They too are tied with a string of melody. That's why they look so alluring. Have some sweets. Why this sweet? I will tell you the good news. First eat sweets. Okay. Here. Baghel Singh, you work with big artists. So what's special in those girls? My dear, last month I went to Mumbai for Mr Rafi's recording. I played the girls' song to him. He said to me, these girls are nightingale of Punjab. - I will come to Punjab with you. - Welcome. Sure, why not. "Your silky, smooth scarf is flying and waving over your head." "May your mother protect you from the evil eye" "By applying black dot." "Your silky, smooth scarf Is flying and waving over your head." "May your mother protect you from the evil eye" "By applying black dot." "that black dot and your blue eyes have hypnotizing power." "The bangles in your wrist And earrings in your ears" "Your blue eyes are hypnotizing me." "I am lonely girl who has many followers and lovers," "But I have already ignored many of my followers" Very good. Very good, dear. God bless you. (Humming) Yes. You sing very melodiously. Sister, from which village are you? I am from Delhi. Delhi? Is Taj Mahal in Delhi? No, it's in Agra. There is something in Delhi also, right? Qutub Minar. Delhi would be very big then. Yes, it's big. Sister, in Delhi there will be at least 20 shops. No, more. There are five in our village only. Then you would get all your grocers in Delhi only. You wouldn't have to go to Nabha for them. Sister, did you buy this dress also from Delhi? Yes. It's a very beautiful dress. - Your attire is very nice. - Thank you. Sister, guess what I have. - Sweets. - No! Voila! We used to eat it earlier, right? What was it called? Samosa. - Samosa. - Samosa. - Here. - Will you have it? No, thanks. Don't you eat Samosa? "Just like a pod of millet," "Just like I twist a pod of millet between my palms." "My upset beloved," "I made my upset beloved return with my charms." "Just like a pod of millet," This design will be like this. Okay, fine. Good. Ma'am, we don't have to write the names of the artists. We can't write their names, but listen... What? Make a design here. - Okay, ma'am. - Okay. - Do you remember the design from other day? - Mr Ashok? Yes, ma'am. Write the names of the artists. Okay, ma'am. "The western winds are troubling me, and the clouds are setting my heart on fire." "The raindrops are now asking me when will your love return" "I wish to die with you, As I am nothing without you." "Your love is the only attire which I use to cover myself." "Just like a pod of millet," "Just like I twist a pod of millet between my palms." "My upset beloved," "I made my upset beloved return with my charms." "Just like a pod of millet," "My heart is like a glass house, where every wall is fragile." "I am scared that may be one day my heart will get scattered." "As whenever I step and look into my heart" "I find only you residing there." "As now I realise that you the only one who lives in my heart" "Just like a pod of millet," "Just like I twist a pod of millet between my palms." "My upset beloved," "I made my upset beloved return with my charms." "Just like a pod of millet," Wonderful. The girls sing so sweetly. I wonder who Roop Kaur and Basant Kaur are. I know them. How do you know them? They are from my aunt's village. - Which village? - It's near Nabha, Kaidampur. - We have to go there. - Okay. "and look into my heart" "I find only you residing there." "As now I realise that you the only one who lives in my heart" Village-head. What was the need to ask the girls to sing? Did you lack anything? You have a big property. If you needed money, you could have asked us. - Yes. - Right. He has lost his reputation. Exactly. - He left in anger. - Yes. You are so bad. You didn't tell me that you were signing. When I brought a dress, I first showed it to them. Whenever I bring something, I show it to them. But they kept sitting quiet here. They didn't tell me once that it's their song. I was wondering why you keep giggling. What else could we have done? Our family had forbid us. You should have told us at least. We are family. Wasn't the song nice? You sing nicely. And we are happy that... our friends' are recording albums. Your names are written so nicely. Roop Kaur and Basant Kaur. Oh dear! I have got a letter. Whose is it? Only Mewa can read it and tell us. From Amritsar. Really? What do they say? I have to read it first. Come. Mother, the suitor has written a letter to Roop. - He is so shameless. - This is not right. I never heard of such a thing. What's written? I will read it. You stupid fool! Will you tell me something? I will beat him up. Yes. He says I am happy to know that Roop sings. I too liked singing in my childhood. After the wedding, we will sing together. - Help me out. - Come. Aunt, are you home? Yes. Come, Sher Singh. Sit. - Greetings, aunt. - God bless you. Sit. - Dear? - Yes, aunt. - Bring a glass of milk. - Okay. I don't want anything, aunt. I came to talk to you. Yes, tell me? Aunt, I won't get my daughter married to that loafer. Why? What happened? What can happen? He has written a letter. He says, he will ask Roop to sing. He will also sing with her. No. We don't want make the girls sing. Yes. Aunt, we have been humiliated enough. Not anymore. Don't worry, I will talk to father. - We will plant sapling quickly. - Okay, brother. - Hello. - Hello. Last time I brought it from Nabha. Didn't work. I had redo everything - Growing onions is more profitable. - You are right, brother. Nothing can beat that. My wife's brothers, they stay near Dhaula Kuan. Believe me. Entire village farms had cultivated it. Nowadays there is profit only in vegetables. Nobody plants millets and barley these days. - Right. Will it look nice if we break this alliance? We will be disgraced in the village. Nobody will bring marriage proposal for your daughters. Already the girls are been talked about. No matter what... but I reject this alliance. It's your wish. Let's go, Mewa. Look, your picture is complete. Where will you put it? I will put it in the drawing room. It will look nice there. We will go and see. You should leave, or else mother will come. Why? We don't bite your mother, do we? Since she learnt about your singing... she has taken offence. She even tells me... not to meet you. Can I open the window? I feel suffocated. "I don't have enough words to praise you," "From now consider me as your shadow." "Your face is bright is like a full moon," "Give me your whereabouts before you leave." "As I want to send marriage proposal," "so let me know whom should I keep the mediator." "Where should I go, and with whom should I share and pour my heart out." "What should I do I don't even know how to convince my heart." "Like diamonds, I will always treasure you." "I shall make you locket and keep you close to my heart." "Your face is bright is like a full moon," "Give me your whereabouts before you leave." "As I want to send marriage proposal." "so let me know whom should I keep the mediator." "You often cross me by turning a blind eye." "You mix your fragrance in the air and you pass by." "My heart skips a beat whenever I see you," "You are a swing and I am your shadow." "Your face is bright is like a full moon," "Give me your whereabouts before you leave." "As I want to send marriage proposal." "so let me know whom should I keep the mediator." "Your face is bright is like a full moon," "Give me your whereabouts before you leave." "As I want to send marriage proposal," "so let me know whom should I keep the mediator." (Humming) - This way please. - "Listen my turbaned beloved," "There is nothing more I need other than you." "There is nothing..." Hello. Hello. Is this Roop and Basant's house? Yes. But I didn't recognise you? I am Baljinder Sindhu from Patiala. From Meharban magazine. I wanted to interview Roop and Basant. Huh? - Mother. - Yes, dear? I wonder what this ma'am wants. I am Baljinder Sindhu from Patiala. I wanted to interview Roop and Basant. Do we have it? I don't know, mother. No, ma'am. We just wanted to ask some questions. We wanted to talk to them. - I see. - Can we? Yes, come. - Your daughters sing very sweetly. - Roop. Basant, come here. Come, dear. Get me a veil. Who is Roop and who is Basant? She is Roop and I am Basant. I am Roop, and she... So you are Roop and she is Basant. Yes. Who is elder between the you two? I am the elder one. She was born in summer season, and she was in autumn. Are you sure, she wasn't born in rainy season? Yes, mother. How do you feel... while embarking on the journey of music? What, sister? What did we do? We have not done anything. No, I mean... how do you feel that an album of your songs are made? - Oh, did you mean that? - Yes. We like it a lot. And you? I too like it a lot. Punjabi folk songs were limited to the walls of the house. But you took it to international level. Your song "Bajre Da Sitta" is heard by Punjabis in every corner of the world. How do your family feels about it... especially your mother? Are they happy? It's hard to say. I don't know about mother. Right. She at times hugs me... and at times hits us. I see. When do you rehearse? Rehearse? We don't get time to rehearse. We either do it while kneading dough... or while washing clothes... or washing utensils. That's it. What is she asking about? Ma'am? - Ask them some good questions. - Pardon? You have scared them. They know knitting... weaving... - and embroidery. - Yes. They both have made a lot of things for their wedding. Can I click a photo? Photo? Yes, sure. Should I sit here? No. Let's click while standing up. Okay. Stand comfortably. Don't be so comfortable. Come a little forward. Can we click a photo with your mother also? - The girls are nice. - Yes. Excuse me. Who are you? I am Baljinder Sindhu from Patiala... from Meharban magazine in Patiala. What brought you here? We came to talk to Roop and Basant. Don't dare to publish their article! Whose permission did you take? You came home stealthily. - Sir, talk with manners. - I will slap you. I will thrash you. - Get lost. Leave in your tin can. - Let's go. Don't cross my path. What a spectacle! - They want news! - Insolent. What did you say? We villagers are insolent. Do what you can. Come here. Don't you dare come back! Come here now. - Come. - This is a limit. Yes. Book a lightening call for Delhi. Hello. Are you from HMG record? Yes, it's Renu. Do you want Roop Kaur and Basant Kaur's photos? Yes. But who are you? Forget that and tell me if you want the photos. Yes. Is the address on the record correct? Yes. I will post the photos. You will get them soon. - Okay. - Bye. Ashok, prepare for a new edition. Okay, ma'am. Sister, our photo is published in the newspaper. - Really? - Come, I will show you. - What's written in it? - Wait. Will you tell me? - Tell me. - Wait. Mewa Singh, will you tell us what's written in it? Don't read quietly. She has published the photo. Who? Baljinder Kaur, who came to our house. What does she write? She wrote... two captivators have held two nightingales in custody. She says Roop and Basant are good singers, but her father don't let them sing. There is a company in Delhi. They have published Roop and Basant's photo. How did they get the photo? She had clicked their photo. Mother, it's your fault. All this happened, because you let them in the house. Son, we women didn't know anything. Bhole. Bhole, go get the newspaper. Go stealthily. I am upset with Baghel Singh. He is a smart guy. I told him so many times... that this is a respectable family. They have a good reputation in all the villages. He respects women a lot. I wonder how this happened. All my life, I helped the people. But I didn't know... people will mock the honour of my family. Let's play. Our dream has come true. Sher! Sher, listen. Sher! This gramophone is the root cause of everything. Today I will end it. Hereafter I don't want to hear singing in this house. "Father is don't like us singing at home" "That's why the walls mourn." "Honour is more important than happiness." "Honour is more important for my father." "Oh God!" "What should we do?" "Our voice is being suppressed." They are incomparable. Only two rows would have been enough, across the river, along with wheat, it would have been good. It would have benefited the wheat as well. Irrigation... Hello. Hello. Sir, is this Roop and Basant's village? Yes, this is her village, but they have left for Ludhiana. Oh! We came with high hopes. From where are you coming? We came from Hoshaipur. I see. Okay, fine. We will pay respect to their village. Bye. Wait your turn, mister. We have been waiting since morning. Sir, if you are Roop and Basant's fans... we too have been waiting since morning. We came from Phagwada. Yes. Join the queue. I didn't come to see Roop and Basant, ma'am. I am their father. And the owner of this house. Okay. Please go. I am tired of making tea. The stove has been lit since morning. 25-30 people came yesterday. I think today double have come. Brother, we should get Roop married and send her away... and get Basant married next year. Okay. Sit. I will make tea. They trusted me, and gave permission to their daughters to sing. How will I face them now? You are still young. You have your whole life in front of you. We should know the value of a life. Sister, listen. I have told them everything. We didn't want our girls to sing. But it just happened. You should have also told... we don't make them sing anymore. I have said that. She is also very wise. She is knowledgable. Entire village praises our Chinder. Yes. Chinder is really praiseworthy. - Yes. - What are you talking about? I was taking about Roop's alliance. My sister-in-law... has a distant cousin in Lahore, Majra. He is her only son. He has a big property also. He has come with the marriage proposal. Sister, what more can we ask for? Yes. It's a prosperous family. Brother, a family reputation does matter. - Sister, we have found out everything. - Really? My husband and I like his family a lot. - Thank God. - Thank God. She is a nice girl. - Very nice. - Really. We would have objection... if the girl had wanted to sing. Neither you nor we would want so. Listening to a song is different. - We all do that. - Yes. But it doesn't look nice if girls of our family sing. - Yes, it's not appropriate. - Yes. We have become averse to radios. We even make others stop playing the radio. To err is human. - We have learnt a lesson. - Right. Let's not overthink about this. We like everything. You should get assured too. We are assured. Sardar, can I talk to the boy once? Go, boy. Good. Come along, Mewa. Boy, you tell me. What's your wish? It's fine. You didn't want them to sing but it happened. We won't let her sing henceforth. No. You tell me, if you had been in my place... what would you have done? No, I wouldn't have allowed her to sing. Here, have some tea. Then give me a hug. - God bless you. - Look. Thank God. Congratulations. Yes. Congratulations. Cotton didn't do well. I will grow sugarcane this time. There is a sugar mill close by. I'll profit from that. Yes. Oh God! Brother, where is this sound coming from? Well... she is our uncle's granddaughter. She is four years old. God knows which disease has inflicted her. First she stopped walking. Now she doesn't even move her hands. Oh dear! We consulted many for advice. Oh dear! That's pretty bad. We even consulted many doctors. They have given up. They say she won't survive. - Oh God. - It must be her mother crying. She keeps crying. She cannot be consoled. It's obvious. I tell her... to start detaching herself from the kid. She is not going to survive. She is her daughter, how she stop loving her. That's true, sister. You look so cute. Can I take it home? Once you get married... I will give it as a wedding present. Okay, fine. When you will go... will you take this drum along? I say... if my in-laws have no problem with my singing... then I will get you married there. You can bring the drum along. We will sing together. Right? Then find a boy for me also over there. I will hear you sing. Okay. I will be left alone. Never mind. If I get married... I will find a boy for you. Roop, Basant. - Come out. - Is it aunt's voice? - It seems to. - Let's see what happened. They are already here. Weren't they supposed to come yesterday? Someone in their family is seriously ill. - That's why they are here. - Okay. - Lentils is ready. - Yes, aunt? They are here for the betrothal. Hurry up. - Huh? - Come, Basant. Hurry up. Come. - Aunt, they are here for me? - Who else? Me? Come on. Hurry up. Hurry up. - Groom is good. - It's a little bad. - They are sitting there. - Come from here. You fool, come this way. Come on! You fools, wherever you go, you just sit there forever. I got them here in a hurry. Come on, hurry up, get dressed! They are waiting outside. - Hold this. - Go now. The road to our village used to be good. It's just bumpy here, otherwise the entire road is good. Okay. - Come outside. - It's the same story everywhere. He has no patience. Give me that. Take the veil. Come on. Sister, this isn't hemmed. What were you doing there? You keep giggling all day, jumping across the terraces. Take your veil. - Come on. Get it. - Going. - Hurry up. - Open it. Here. Not around the neck, take it over your head, you fool. Do it like this. Come on. You help her. Do you hear me? Stitch it fast. Come on. Let's go. "My dear, where did You spend it?" "My dear, where did you spend the night?" "I have been reasoning my self as to where you could be." "My dear, where did you spend it?" "My dear, where did you spend the night?" "I have been reasoning my self as to where you could be." "My dear, where did you spend it?" "Terrace upon terrace," "The vegetables are drying on the terrace." "The lovers have planted staircase." "And girlfriends joined the way to reach there." "My dear, where did You spend it?" "My dear, where did you spend the night?" "I have been reasoning my self as to where you could be." "My dear, where did you spend it?" "Terrace upon terrace," "The sands are drying on the terrace." "I cannot sleep, come and have a look." "My dear, where did you spend it?" "My dear, where did you spend the night?" "I have been reasoning my self as to where you could be." "My dear, where did you spend the night?" "I have been reasoning my self as to where you could be." "My dear, where did you spend it?" "Don't send me tonight, Father, let me stay here another night." "How do I do that, my dear? This is tough for me too." "My dear, where did you spend the night?" "I have been reasoning my self as to where you could be." "My dear, where did you spend it?" Close the windows. It doesn't looks good when you singing sound going out. Close the window and sing. Look sister, we had been waiting for the wedding so eagerly and it's already over. We are so tired. Sister? Such a beautiful daughter-in-law has come to the village. We are so pleased. Yes, sister. First I had come... and now she has come. - Look at her. - Look at her. Daughter, you sing very well. What was that song? Shinder played it to me. "Bajre Da", something... Bajre Da Sitta, aunt. Very good. - We will have party together. - Right. Aunt, you spare her. She sang in her past life. Here, this is her new life. She won't sing here. There are other ways to entertain. Right? Well, son, you are her husband. - She will do what you like. - Right. Take her inside. The child's getting wet. "There is no sympathy here, I live surrounded by sorrows." "There is no sympathy here, I live surrounded by sorrows." "I keep begging you," "O' My Good Lord!" "O' My Good Lord!" Tara! Didn't you see her? Could you have taken her? Now God will take her. "I keep begging you," "O' My Good Lord!" "O' My Good Lord!" A person who can speak... is the one who will be taken first, right? The girl doesn't say anything. Mother, is there any treatment? Won't she survive? Chances are slim Even the herbalist has given up hope. He had cured many serious ailment. We consulted many. Won't she live? Dear, it's difficult. Now only God is our last hope. Mother... had it been a boy in her place... would you have left him to die? What are you saying? They even took her to a hospital in Ludhiana. What more can they do? We aren't killing her on purpose. Aunt? Are you home? We are home. Come, dear. Hello, aunt. Hello, dear. We came to meet the new bride. Go on it. You can certainly meet her. Come, sisters. - You are back from Patiala! - I came yesterday. We came to meet the new bride. Sister-in-law, they are my friends. - Hello. - Hello. We came to hear your song. Yes. Girls, go inside. Raji, don't stand here. - Go and sing inside. - Okay. Okay, aunt. Let's go. Come, sit. "My beloved is like small box of kohl, what more do I want?" "My beloved is like small box of kohl, what more do I want?" "Like small box of kohl." Leave it there. "His love is sufficient for me to cover myself," "I never wore expensive clothes." I have brought grocery. I didn't get soap for washing clothes. I will bring it when I go to Nabha. Never mind. What's the commotion? Girls have come. They want to hear the bride's song. I asked them to go inside. "The size of my bangle now seems" "Whenever I listen to his footsteps," "I can't utter a word," "Even he takes advantage when he releases the situation" "My dear friends, even he stays silent." "He is the brightness in my eyes and when he is close" "I don't remove my veil from my head." "Like small box of kohl." "My beloved is like small box of kohl, what more do I want?" "My beloved is like small box of kohl, what more do I want?" We don't need it anymore. They stick together. They pull along. The king asked the queen... What is this? - I don't know about this. - Umm... - Train. - Yes. - One more. - Yes, tell us more. Should I ask a riddle? - Yes. - Yes. A bird was trapped in a net. She flew in her thought. The one who made everyone laugh... is in such a plight today. Roop. Since Roop has gone after her wedding... I don't like it here. Both the sisters used to sing here. Now even Basant doesn't come. Gulab, now the flowers don't bloom. "You can ask the stars, my dear." "I wait for you all night, you can ask the stars." "I ruined myself for you, you can ask the promises you had made." "I wait for you all night, you can ask the stars." "I stand near the window in the middle of the night. Yes, I do." "I stand near the window in the middle of the night. Yes, I do." "I shed tears for you. Yes, I do. "And I keep sighing." "You can ask the stars, my dear." "I ruined myself for you, you can ask the promises you had made." "I wait for you all night, you can ask the stars." "I ruined myself for you, you can ask the promises you had made." "I wait for you all night--" Don't you understand? I keep telling you not to sing. You keep singing here, and drunkards stand and dance. You have defamed me in the village. My bangle broke. - Son! - Get this straight! You fool! Have you lost your mind? Leave her. You shameless! She just got married. Is this how you behave? I will beat you. Come to your senses! Go and eat food. If I see you singing again, I'll send you back to your parents' house. Understood? Go and eat food. Oh, my God! Oh no! Never mind, dear. He is mad. Never mind. I will talk sense into him. You don't song. Okay? "It hurts a lot..." "This wound on my heart." "This wound on my heart." "Fine, I'll give up everything," "Just for you, my love." "Just for you, my love." "Tell me, what else you want." "You can ask the stars, my dear." "I ruined myself for you," "You can ask the promises you had made." "How can our path be the same?" "You can ask the stars, my dear." "I ruined myself for you," "You can ask the promises you had made." "I wait for you all night," "You can ask the stars." Listen. Please listen. I didn't want to do it. But it just happened. I won't do it again. But you too try to understand. My family has a reputation in this village. It will get ruined over a small thing. You are my queen. You should stay happy. Everybody loves you so much. Right? Tell me what you want. But please don't do this. Okay? Understood? Now give me a smile. Smile. I too was a fool like you. I kept singing all day. My grandpa had taught me something. We are honourable people. Singing isn't for us. We just listen. Have you ever heard... that a king or noble man sang a song? You cannot sing. If you want to lead a respectable life... don't take interest in singing. And since that day, I made up my mind. Here, girls don't even laugh wholeheartedly... let alone singing. Tell me what you want. I will bring it. But don't sing. Okay? Okay. How long will it take, father? It won't take long. She's too eager. We should be back at the break of dawn. - Hold this. - Yes. - Bye. - Please come. - Okay, bye. - The entire village has left. Coming. - Oh. - We'll get there eventually. You are shouting for no reason. - We are lucky to see this day. - You too come. - Yes. We will get to meet great souls. - Give me that. - Yes. - We are very fortunate. How is Deepi doing? - She is doing better now. - Wonderful. - I really wanted to do go. - Let's go. We'll get to meet great souls. I had been waiting for so long. Go, give it. (Humming) (Humming) Palli. Palli, open your eyes. Palli. Palli! Palli, open your eyes. Palli. Brother? Palli. What happened? What happened to her? - I don't know what is wrong with her, brother. - Palli. - What happened, sister-in-law? - Give her to me. - Don't worry. - Palli. - It's okay, don't worry. - Palli! - Palli. - Palli. - Palli. Rub her feet. - Palli. Open your eyes. - Palli. - What happened? Palli? - Rub her feet. - Faster. - What is wrong with her? Please get up. - Palli. Open your eyes. - Don't cry, sister. - Palli. - Brother, save her. - Get up. - Brother, please call the doctor. - Palli. - She will die. - Palli. - I will go, sit. - Palli. - Palli. Get up, please. - Palli. - Get up, Palli. - Palli. Get up, please. - Don't cry, sister. Be strong. - Save her. - She will be fine. - Palli. - Palli. - Be strong. - Palli. - Palli. - She will be fine. - Don't worry. - Please help her. - Palli. - Get up, Paali. Doctor? Open the gate. - Doctor? - Who is it? - Open the gate. - I am coming. Wait. - Yes? - I have come from the village. Katar Singh's granddaughter is not well. Son, I have told you so many times. There is no hope for her. I beg of you. Just once come with me. - I won't refuse you. - Thanks. Everyone had gone out. When I didn't understand anything, I came to you. You did good. - Rub her feet. - They have not yet come. - I will go and check once. - They will come. - I will go and check. - Palli. Palli. - Palli. - Go with her. - Yes. Palli, my child. Let's go, son. "This moon is your saviour," "This moon is your saviour," "May the stars always be your favour to protect you." "May the stars always be your favour to protect you." "May you smile and live merrily," "May you smile and live merrily," "This is all I wish for you." "This is all I wish for you." "This moon is your saviour." "The nature will save you and will also protect you." "And may sun always burn away your pain." "And may sun always burn away your pain." "May you daily sleep in peace listening to melodies of lullabies" "May you daily sleep in peace listening to melodies of lullabies" "And peace will then be with you whenever you rest in breeze." "And peace will then be with you whenever you rest in breeze. " "This moon is your saviour," "This moon is your saviour," Mother? "Those who accept Your will, get blessed with happiness, sadness stays away." "Their lamps survive through the storms." "They get blessed with happiness, sadness stays away." "O' My Good Lord!" I swear... I didn't want to sing. I made a mistake. I won't ever sing again. You sit. Please come home, father. Come outside, uncle. Come here mother, listen to me. Come, everyone! Children, you too. - I beg of you. - Wait. Father, come. Listen to me carefully. I will say it last time. I have made the final decision. Your daughter, my wife, Roop... will sing from today. We thought you were wise. But you turned out to be crazy. The miracle which I witnessed... if you had seen it... you too would have gone crazy. Music is God's gift to Roop. It can put life in a dying person. I can't do the sin of suppressing God's gift. Don't lecture us. You are naive. You don't know the ways of the society. We don't want to get defamed. Son, listen to me carefully. If you want to lead a quiet life, go ahead. Or else, leave her here and go away. If she stays with me, she will... sing. How can she? Brother! Sister. What are you doing, Shera? Aren't you ashamed? How dare you push our son-in-law! Mother, I hate singing. It brings disgrace. Let alone our daughters... I don't even like the birds singing. Even if the birds go quiet... the leaves will move with the wind. There is music even in the air. If the air stops... your breath will go on. There is music in that too. If you stop your breath... your heart will still beat. There is music in it too. And if the heart stops beating... there will be silence everywhere. Listen carefully, you will find music there also. God is music. Soul is music. Around music, a person feels... like a pot in water. There is water inside... as well as outside. "My beloved is like small box of kohl, what more do I want?" "My beloved is like small box of kohl, what more do I want?" "Whenever I listen to his footsteps, I can't utter a word" "Even he takes advantage when he releases the situation," "My dear friends, even he stays silent." "He is the brightness in my eyes and when he is close," "I don't remove my veil from my head." "Like small box of kohl." "My beloved is like small box of kohl, what more do I want?" Our daughter-in-law has made us proud, sister. This is right. Thank God. "I am submerged in his thoughts from dawn to dusk," "And on top of that to makes other girls heart skips beat," "I keep his name on my lips." "When no leave moves that's when I sing his song." "Like small box of kohl." "My beloved is like small box of kohl, what more do I want?" "My beloved is like small box of kohl, what more do I want?" "His love is sufficient for me to cover Myself, I never wore expensive clothes." "I don't even miss my parents," "Whenever he utters sweets words." "The size of my bangle now seems to be as same as the circumference of the earth." "Like small box of kohl." "My beloved is like small box of kohl, what more do I want?" "My beloved is like small box of kohl, what more do I want?" Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
