Hey, honey... don't be bad. I am bad. I know... but that's just a... a secret between me and you. And I really do have to go. - Honey, I'm home. Yeah, I'm in here. Hi. I'll just be a minute. Are you hungry? - Um... No, I just had some drinks with clients so... Ellie go down okay? - Yeah, she was tired. - Maybe I will get something to eat. - All right, I'll be in in a minute. - Okay. - Okay. Absolutely. Well, now remember you said you would not going to take less than 375, but I went ahead and I got you 400. Is that all right? Great. Yeah, Yeah, I'll bring the papers by tomorrow. Well, you're welcome. Al All right, bye. - Got a second? - Yeah. - I'm a little upset. - Why? - Because when you started here last year I thought you were just another housewife with too much time on your hands. Now, you're one of my top agents. - What can I say? I'm a natural. - But you haven't taken the broker's course and you haven't applied for your license. Why not? - I know it's cliche but I'm having a hard balancing, you know, home and work. - Well, let me tempt you. Do you want to show the Bentley house? - Wow. Are you serious? - A couple named Corelli, drove by and fell in love with the place. They want to see it tonight. - Tonight. Um... - Is that a problem? - No, no, no, no. I can work it out. - Okay. - I just... I've got to make a phone call, and... - Well, do good. - Thanks. - You want to grab a bite, after? - I'll have to get home. But maybe lunch sometime. - Dinner's better. Maybe next week? - Umm... - Hi, hi, hi. It's Meg. Is he there? No, that's okay. Just tell him something came up, and he'll need to pick up our daughter today. - Okay, thanks. - Bye. I just love this house, everything about it. It's just wonderful. What are recent comps in this neighborhood? This is the most expensive listing south of Gibson. It's also the most impressive. I mean, let me tell you. There're three properties that have sold on this street in the last four months. Each of them sold within two days of listing and each seller thought they'd undervalued their property. This just came on the market today. - The problem is, we're going out of town tomorrow. We aren't going to be back until next week. - You know, go, have dinner, call me at home later. If you decide you want to go forward, I'll make it happen for you. - All right, thanks. Thank you. - Mrs. Corelli. - Thank you. Talk to you later. Now can I watch TV? Sure, I'll be right in. - So, do you think I should? Should what? - You know, get serious about this. Study for the exam and get my broker's license. George is very encouraging. - It sounds like a lot of work and you're already stretched pretty thin. - Really? I think I'm doing pretty well. - Well, it didn't go so well tonight. - I'm sorry. It came up literally last minute. - But you assumed I'd be able to pick up Ellie from school. I mean, what if I couldn't? - You told me this morning you were free. - But that can changed. You get your broker's license, it'll only get worse. I mean, you were out three nights last week with work. And I don't think you've cooked dinner in a week. - What do you want me to do? Quit? Become a full time housewife? - Maybe. I'm not so sure I like you working so close with George. - I not even going to comment on that. - Hey. "Mortgage Syndication Handbook." No wonder you're laughing up here so much. - I'm sorry, I didn't mean to go off like that. I didn't mean any of that stuff about George. I don't even know what I was thinking. - Yeah, I couldn't believe you said that. I mean, I've been jealous of you but I've never seen you be jealous of me. - Now I'm in trouble. You like it? - Yeah, I like it. - Truce? - Yeah. Let the machine get it. Hello. Yes, yes, Mr. Corelli. No, no, no, it's fine. You do? Yes. Well, I can be over there in half an hour. Okay. Thank you. Bye. - You're going to show someone a house at this time of night? - I know, honey. They're leaving town tomorrow morning. This is a really a big sale. I'm sorry. I'll be back as soon as I can. So, I go over to their house at ten o'clock last night, okay? They fax it. They accept the offer. It was almost too easy. George, you keep telling me how great I am and I'm going to start believing you. All right, I'll see you at the office. Bye. Here. - Mom, why can't I have chocolate cereal? - 'Cause it's a bowl of sugar, honey. I can't believe you conned your father into buying that. Tell her it's fortified with vitamins and minerals. - It's fortified with vitamins and minerals. - You're no help. - Don't expect me until late. Some of the boys from New York are coming in. - And I've got to wine and dine 'em. Poor you. I thought that was next week. - Yeah, it got pushed up. I'll be back as soon as I can. Congratulations on that sale. - Thank you. Lisa. I know you're avoiding me. Here's your notice. I get the rent in three days or you're out! Well, well, well, well. - Would you believe I've missed you? - Yeah... Yeah... I bet. Ha. So... what? You need money...? Or you lost your job...? Or, could it be your 'boyfriend' left you? - Now I remember why I left you. You're such a jerk. - Ha, ha, ha. - Why can't you just accept that I've missed you? - Because, Lisa, everything that comes out of your mouth is guaranteed to be a lie. Everything. - So, if I said that I wanted your bod, right here, right now, would that be a lie? - Guaranteed. But I can live with that. I can live it it. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down please. You know I'm in a relationship. - Right. Straight, old, married guy. Whoo! That's a whole bunch of fun I bet. - He loves me. S Ha ha ha. I've got some blow in the bedroom, wanna do a bone? No. - How much? - How much what? - How much do you need to borrow? - I did miss you. Straight up. - Come on, how much? - I got a three day notice today so, enough to cover my rent. - Who would'a thought? You move back in here, you won't have to worry about paying rent. - You want to go over the reasons I moved out in the first place? - Pass. Let's go out and party instead. Party, yeah. Let's go. - Sure. - Hey, relax. Here's your rent. But my offer still stands. What'd I tell you? I told you he'd use ya and he'd dump ya. Right? I know people. Come on. Hey, Sally, tell Stevie I wasn't feeling - so good and I went home. - And he shouldn't worry about you, right? Right. See you later. You're late. What about this place? Let's go in here for a drink. No, it's so lame. C'mon, let's go. Okay, we have to be very quiet. The neighbors can hear everything. I've got some vodka. Here let me take your coat. - It's okay, I'll keep it on. - You're not staying? - That's what I wanted to talk to you about. We can't see each other anymore. - Okay, let's not do this again, all right? I don't care how much older you are, I love you. - I need to try and make my marriage work. - You bastard. - Lisa... - You bastard! You bastard! - Lisa, listen, calm down! Just calm down! I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry! I love my wife, and I don't want to leave my child. - Don't do this to me, Tom. Please, not now. - It's better this way. - No. I... I love you. I really do. - You'll find somebody else. Someone who can love you back.. - Nooo... - Lisa, please. - Why... why not? We're over, right? Why not just grab one more for the road? - Lisa, don't... Stop it! - No... - We're not over! We're not! - I'm sorry.... - We're not over! Hi, honey. You had a rough night entertaining the boys? - I'm getting too old for this. - Well, come on, you want me to bring you some tea or something? - Want to have a drink? - My god, Tom, you do not need another drink. - Only had one drink, officer, I swear. - Come on, come on. You need to go to bed. - Want to come? - No, not with you like this. Come on. You gotta go to work in the morning. - Good morning, Tiger. - Wow, breakfast in bed. What's the occasion? - You are three seconds away from wearing Eggs Benedict. - Happy anniversary? - Good boy. - I knew that. I was saving your present for the party tonight. - Well, maybe I've got a present for you right now. Don't you have to go to work? - let me show you how I close a deal. Line two. A woman named Lisa. Tom, do you want me to take a message? - No, I'll take it. You can't call me here. - I want to apologize for last night. I don't want us to end that way. - Forget it. - Do you think we can get together, you know, just to ta I promise I won't get crazy. - I think it's better if we just leave it be. - I'm afraid, Tom. Do you think I could call you sometime? You know, talk things through. - No. Don't call me. Goodbye, Lisa. - Thank you. Thanks. "Don't be afraid. It's best this way. Take care. Please don't cal - NO-O-O-O! NO! NO! NO! NO! - What's up? You know anyone who wants one of these things? I got like 10 of them for next to nothing, crackhead special. What the hell happened to you last night? - I felt sick so I went home. - Yeah? I heard you got into a car with some guy, drove off. - I took a cab. - Black Beemer, nice cab. Tell me something, Lisa, where does that boyfriend take you that I don't? I'm just asking a question here. - Screw him. I don't want to talk about him. - Yeah! Level eight, ba-by! What... what's the matter? Was he mean to you? Jesus. Jesus. - Nice? - He did this to you? - I did it to myself, what do you think? - Let me see. It's okay. You want me to mess him up? Yeah? Yeah. Let me see. It's okay. Stevie, what's up, man? Nothing, man. Same old. How's the new gig? - I love it, man. The girls are gorgeous. I only have to pound on a couple of customer every now and then, you know what I mean? - Is that a bad thing or a good thing? - What's a good thing, man? I owe you one, man. I owe you one. - Yeah. I might take you up on that. - Whaddya need? - Justice. Yeah, justice. You know, the wheels of Karma set in motion. - How much justice? - I don't know. Maybe just this side of broken bones. Well, if you er a little, that's cool, too. - For you... no problem, bro. - Hah. - Solid. - I'll be... I'll be in touch. Hi, honey. Sorry, I'm late. - Hey, where've you been? I've been worried sick. - I had to make a very important stop to make. - They're beautiful. - I love you. - Love you, too. Honey, go get ready. The guest are almost here. - Right. Wow. Now why don't you were something like this in the office? - Because you have trouble focusing as it is, George. - You still look great. - Thanks. Hey, Tom. I've got a little surprise for you. - Hi, Mr. Davidson. Long time no see. - Meg, you're just in time to see your husband blush. - Am I? - Erica's all grown up. - And taking theatre at college. Great! How are you liking school? - I love it, except for classes. - Okay, you have your priorities s So, may I have a little drink? Sure, a glass of wine? - Stoli, rocks. - They just grow up so fast. Meg! There you are. I've been trying to get a dance with you for an hour. You know, I gotta a couple things to check on in here, Stan, but when I come back out, - I promise. - Okay, you're on. All right with you? Take this ice out - to the bar for me? - Yeah. I hope you gave Tom next Wednesday night off. - My god, what is it? Like, bowling for beer or cage fighting, pay per view? - Better - the New York group are coming to town, and we must wine and dine. - Really? I thought that was the other night. Nope, this Wednesday. - And don't expect Tom before midnight. - Okay. - Okay. - May I? - Sure. Your husband's real smooth, Mrs. Davidson. - Yeah, I know. Well, little Erica really seems to like you. - Well, of course, she does. I'm smooth. - That you are. Hey, listen, Stan said I have to let you wine and dine the New York group Wednesday night. - Right. - Well, I though you did that the other night? - Um... that was the meeting to set the meeting. - A meeting to set the meeting? - The other night was a scout group and the main contingent is still to come. You are smooth. Hold it, hold it, everybody! Everybody, I'd like to make a speech. Hold on, it's about my wife. Meg, come on here. Come up here, Sweetheart. My partner. My friend. - My lover. - Whahoo! My wife. You keep me on the straight and narrow. I love you. - I love you. Happy Anniversary. Did you... did you see Joanie? - Man, can she ever dance, wow. - That was so much fun. - Yeah, it was. And you, you are the bestest, most sexiest, most beautifulest wife I ever had. - Come on. My god, but you've had a lot to drink. - Not so much that I can't take care of business. - I know but slow down, cowboy. Come on. I'll be right back, okay? - I'll be ready to rock. Let that be a warning to you. - Are you still with us? - Yeah. How was I? - The earth moved. - Really? That's good. - Well, happy anniversary. - Happy, happy... love you. Uhm? Tom? Don't make a sound! Put the knife down and get on the floor. I'm just here for your stuff. I'm not here to hurt anybody. Okay? - Ulp...... - TOM! TOM...! - Mommy! - Ellie, go back inside your room! - TOM! What'cha got? His name's Renfrew, Derek K., 26. Has an arms-length sheet for break-ins, thefts, assaults, you name it. He had a bat, and she took him out with a kitchen knife. - Well, that's one tough lady. - It's like a dream... slow-motion like a bad dream. Um... I can't get him out of my head. It'll take some time. You might want to talk to someone, a professional. Mrs. Davidson, I'm going to need you to come downtown with me to take a formal statement. - Yeah, they said that. - It's up to you, but if you want an attorney present, you can have one. - My husband called someone from his firm. - Is he here? - He took my, um... our daughter to a neighbor's house, and he'll be right back. What if I hadn't grabbed the knife? - You're very lucky. Okay, it's all done. The DA think justifiable homicide. - So, that's it? - Routine follow-up. The guy had a burglary record. - Come on, let's go home. - I don't want to go there just yet, okay? - I understand. We'll go to a hotel. - Yeah. - Okay. Thanks, Mike. Thanks for coming No problem. Meg, I know it's going to hurt for a while, but remember - that guy could've hurt your family. He could have taken your daughter. You did what you had to do. - Okay, thanks. - Thanks. - Okay. Meg. I just found out. Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm here. - I thought you might want some company. - Sure. - Is this where he came through? - Yeah, I don't want to get into that. - You know, let's get out of here. Let me take you to lunch. - You need to get out of this house. - I'd feel better about it when it's all finished here. Okay. Then let's put all this stuff away and... I will pour us a glass of wine. - Sure. I've got it right in front of me and it says, um... hold on a second? Tina, what's the name of that property on Kinglsey? - Palmer house and it's sold. You're late for your two o'clock. - I don't have a two o'clock. - Check your calendar. Aw, jeez. I'll have to get back to you on that, okay? Thanks. - Hey, it's me. No one's here. He just called, he said they were going to leave. They've been waiting for almost an hour. - No one's here. - What address are you at? - 722 Upper Darby. - Wrong house, Bradley is over across the bridge. - Okay, um... All right, well, just tell them that I'm sorry, okay? - Okay. When you're not messing something up, what are you thinking about? - Him. Killing him. You know, the sound that he made when I stabbed him. The way he slumped to the ground, and just fell over. And then, on top of everything, I have this sense of foreboding, you know, like... like something's going to happen, and that was just the first thing. - What do you think might happen? - You know, my daughter gets kidnapped or killed, and my husband has a car accident or the house burns down. I don't know. Like the... Like the door to badness has been opened and, you know, if that could happen then, you know, why not something else? - Does it ever feel good that you were strong enough to act like you did? - I just keep thinking about him. Yeah, Ellie will love that. That'll be great Mom. Okay, I'll see you Sunday. Okay. You know, I think I'm going to call the hotel back because if you want the Spa Package you have to pre-register. - And we want the spa package. Yeah. - I'm just going to do one last check in the house and I'll be right back. - Okay. Hi. Yeah. - I don't know whose earring it is! There are women I work with, for god's sake! I gave Denise a ride home the other night - maybe it's hers. - Why? Why did you give Denise a ride home? - Because her car was in the shop! - Why didn't you tell me? - Why would I? I mean, what is the big deal? - Well, how could she lose an earring in the car? - I don't know! Maybe it came off when she reached in the back seat for her briefcase. Let's just sit down, okay? Maybe it's me, but I have been feeling for a while like... like you're just not telling me everything. Are you involved in something illegal? - What? - Just... I mean, the guy that broke into our house, could he have be after you? - I'm not involved in anything illegal. The police said it was a random break-in with no connection to us whatsoever. - Okay, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I just feel like I'm going crazy. Okay. - No, they're not knock-offs, man. They're absolutely real. Just look at 'em you can tell. Yeah, all right then. Tonight, I'll be around. Call me or not. I'll be here. - Whoa. I thought you said we were going out. I'm not going to sit around here all night while you wait for some deal. - That's exactly what you're going to do. - Really? You think you own me? - That's why I left you in the first place, dumb ass. - Who are you calling? - None of your business. Don't... don't mess with me. Who are you calling? - Tom. He'll meet me for a drink. - LISTEN TO ME! All right, listen to me. You're not to see him or speak to him ever again. Do you understand me? - Or what? You're going to beat me up, too? - You remember when you wanted to mess him up because of what he did to you? - Yeah? - Well, I did it. I hired somebody. - What! - Yeah, the guy was supposed to beat him up after work. Instead he goes to the guy's house. - Ohmigod. What happened to Tom? - He's fine, Lisa, he's okay. - Yeah... and? - My guy got killed! Your boyfriend's wife killed him. - She... she killed him? - Yeah, she did a good job. She stuck him with a kitchen knife. Okay, listen to me. Yes. You wanted me to mess him up. I got a guy to do it, Lisa. That guy's dead. We got a big problem. It's going to be okay, Lisa. All you have to do is... Listen, all you have to do is stay away from him. Either way, we're in this together. We're in it together. Yeah, we are. Stay away from him, Lisa. This project is going to be so hot. It's going to be beautiful, just beautiful. - They'll practically sell themselves. - Probably. - Do you want the listing? - Are you kidding? - Yours exclusively, just say yes. - This is incredible. It's like, a great opportunity. - So, we have a deal? I don't know, George. I just don't know if I'm ready to come back to work, that much. - Why not? - Look at me. Don't I look tired? - You look great. - Go on, tell the truth. - Okay, maybe a little tired. - I just... I haven't been sleeping much and I've been scattered, and I just think you need somebody who's on top of things. So I'm going to pass. Nice little gun, not much kick. - I haven't shot a gun since summer camp. - Step up to the rail. Remember, let out your breath as you squeeze the trigger. - Did I hit it? - No, not yet. Try again. Don't hold the gun so tight. Gently apply pressure to the trigger until it fires. There you go! You take the course here, you'll be fine. - Thanks, Mike, I appreciate you helping me out. - I'm happy to do it. We should get Meg down here, too. - I don't know. She's got a thing about guns. - She doesn't know you're getting this? - I'll tell her eventually but since the break-in I just haven't felt safe. Hopefully I won't need it. - Hi, Daddy! - Hi. Okay, honey, go up and wash your hands. - How's my little girl? - Good. - Are you good? - Hum. - Hum. - Can I finish my show? - You can't go against the boss. Go on, kiddo. - I'll put this out. Did you get vegetable mushu? - Yes. How come you didn't retu - Did you call the office? - Twice. No one told you? - I was running in and out all day. I must have spaced. - Sounds like you're getting back into the swing of things. - Yeah, I'm trying. Still not there. - Well, take your time. I kinda like having you home at night. Hello. Yeah. She did? Hold on a second. A Detective Wilson returning your phone call? - Hi, thanks for calling me back. Um... no. I was wondering if I could see a copy of the police report. No, I'm just curious. Great. Okay, thank you. - You called to get a copy of the police report? - Yeah, why wouldn't I? It's been hard enough for you to get over this. I mean, I just don't see the good in wallowing in the details. - Well, maybe there are some things that just still don't make sense. You know, there's never been a burglary like this in this neighborhood, ever. And burglars, they don't want to meet people. They don't want confrontation. - We've been through this with the police. Meg, you're starting to obsess about this. You have to put this behind you. - It's easy for you to say. You were upstairs drunk and asleep. - Now, you're blaming me. You know what? You're starting to really worry me. - You know, you want your old life back. Fine. But I was almost killed and you just act like you couldn't care less. I'm going to go to Joanie's, okay? And you can do all this. And you can put Ellie to bed. And then you can sleep down here tonight. Wilson > There's not much here. I think you'll find it pretty dry. Thank you. Um... can I ask you a question? This man, Renfrew, does he have family here? Yes, he does. - Well, um... is there some way I can contact them? - I'm sorry, Mrs. Davidson, I can't help you with that. Listen, you ask any cop who's ever had to shoot somebody, it's tough. It's always tough and the only thing that makes it better is time. - Yeah, they said that. - Okay. Well, you can have a seat here. - Hey, George. > - I thought I'd surprise Meg. Kidnap her for a nice dinner out. - That sounds great but she's not here. I haven't seen her in a couple days. - Isn't she out showing properties? She said things were picking up. - Actually, not. I wanted her to take over this big condo project but she passed. Sorry. - Thanks. - Sweetheart, are you sure Mommy didn't say where she was going to be today? - She didn't? - Can I have another cookie? - Another one? All right, one more. That's it. Your mom will kill me. [c [clatter Meg, I dropped by your office to surprise you. I'm home now with Ellie. Where are you? Call me. Joanie, it's Tom. Yeah. Is Meg with you? You don't know where she is? Okay, thanks. Hi. Hi. Where have you been? - Um... I was at the library, sorry. Did you guys eat dinner? - Yeah. "Ordinary Killers" "Women Who Kill"? Jesus, Meg, I don't believe this. - What is it you don't believe? - This, obsession. I went by your office today. I was going to take you out for a nice dinner. I had a babysitter for Ellie. You weren't there. George, said you hadn't been there in days. - Ellie's in bed? - Yes, I told her you'd kiss her goodnight. Why couldn't you tell me where you were? - You know, Tom, after you blew up last night, I didn't want to tell you what I was up to at all. - Which was...? - Researching. Finding out anything I can about normal people who've killed somebody. - Does your therapist support this? - I'm not seeing her anymore. She wasn't helping. - Well, I think you should go back to her, Meg, because I'm afraid you're losing it. - Stop criticizing me. I'm not losing it. And why don't you read one of these? You know, what I'm going through is not unusual. I'm sorry if this is all inconvenient for you. Chapman called about the deposition. He wants to know if you can reschedule. - Tell him no. Nicely, but no. You've had three calls from some woman, sounds young. She doesn't want to leave a message, won't give her name, she just asks for you. - Don't put her through, even if I'm here. - Okay. Hello? Anyone here? Hello? I'm not finished packin' it yet. I thought you weren't coming by 'til tomorrow. It's going to take me the rest of the day. - I must have gotten the day mixed up. - You can take some of it now, if you want. - No, no. That's all right. Thanks, sorry about that. - What did I tell you? - Excuse me? - I'm sorry... I thought you were somebody else. - Hello! Anybody home? - Daddy's home! Daddy's home! - Ha! Hello, my sweetheart. How are you? - Good. - You're good. Look at these. - Pretty flowers. - Who do you think they're for? - Mommy. - That's right, for mommy. Can I take you away from all of this? - Well, this is very nice, sir. - I would like to take my family out to dinner. Where would you like to go? - Burger Town! - Burger Town. Mmmmmm. Onion rings. - It'll be nice to get out. Onion rings sound great. - Ha, ha, ha. Onion rings it is. - And burgers. - And burgers and milkshakes. - So, what was so funny at the register tonight? - Where? - When you were paying the bill at Burger Town. You were talking to that girl and you both started laughing. - I don't know. I told some dumb joke. I think she was flirting with me. - Flirting? She was all of 20. - What can I say? It was nothing. - Don't make a habit of it. You'll embarrass yourself. - Are you coming to bed? - I'm not really that tired. I'm just going to go downstairs and read. - Hi. In Chicago. I need a number for 'Tommy's'. - Hi. - How are you doing? - Good. Grapefruit and gin. Half a shot. - One gin and juice, light. - So, this is the famous 'Tommy's' I don't know how famous we are, but you should check us out at night, it's pretty jumping. - Have you worked here long? - I'm not a lifer, but I've been here awhile. - Um... I was wondering if you could help me with something. Do you know this guy? - No. I've never seen him before. - What about the girl? - No, sorry. The picture's definitely taken here, but it could've been years ago. Looks like our Halloween bash. Why are you trying to find the guy? - He's a friend of the family and we just lost touch. Hey, bartender! Can we get another round? - Excuse me. - Yeah, no problem. This place is dead. - Just like our relationship. - Nice. - You know that woman? - What woman? - The one you just bumped into? - No, why? - She had a picture of you, taken with some guy at our Halloween party here. - What did she want? - She was looking for the guy Lisa was with in the picture. - Who was the guy? - I never saw him before. You tell her anything about me? - I said I had no idea who you were. - Good answer. - Beers? - Yeah. What the hell is going on, Lisa? - How should I know? - Yeah, what? Some woman comes into the bar looking for you, what's that? 'Kay, No one was looking for me. She was looking for that guy. - Really? - Hum. Don't worry about it. - Green means go. - What are you doing? - Don't be mad, Dad. I missed you real bad. - Look, I told you it was over and it's over. Now please, just leave me alone. - I just want to talk. Can't we get a drink? - No, we can't get a drink. Lisa, it's over. Now please... I got a call from Arron Milsted, represents their patent department. They want to meet. - Good. It sounds like you've got them heading in the right direction. You know, when I first started at Seaverson and Night, they did those three martini lunches. I knew I'd never make it there. - Speaking of martinis, I think Donleavy jus into the bar. I've been trying to get him all morning. - What are you doing here? - Why don't I join you guys for a drink? - This is a very important lunch. Now, I need you need to leave here now. - Then meet me later. Tonight. - Why are you prolonging this? - Because I still have feelings. I can't deal with them by myself. I've got a new cell number, all right? I left a message, so now you have it. Don't worry, I'm not going to call your wife and all that. But I need to talk to you. - I was going to charge up your phone and I saw that you had all these messages on here. Do you want them right now? - Doubt it. It's a little late now anyway. - How was your lunch with Mitchell today? - Lunch was, um... was good. The Waterhouse case is finally moving forward. - And who'd you have dinner with? - I know, lunch, dinner... Arron Milsted, he's part of the Waterhouse case. What? - Nothing. - What is it, Meg? - Did you really have dinner with clients tonight? - Yes. - The whole time? - Are you serious? - Just answer the question. - Yes, the whole time. - All right, I'll just go charge up your phone then. - Hi. Hi, my name is Davidson. I need to check on an order. Great. I... We sent some flowers on the 17th. And I just talked to her and she never got them. Well, yes, I'm sure somebody did accept them. It just doesn't mean they went to the right address, so, um... what address do you have for...? 618 Ashland. Lisa Carver. No, gosh, that's just... That's all correct. Yes, I will. Thank you very much. Okay, I thought that I was going crazy, you know, that I was being paranoid. And Tom told me that I was obsessed, that I should stop looking into this. - Please have a seat, Mrs. Davidson. Are you sure the woman you saw today was this woman? - Yes, Lisa Carver. I mean, Detectives, you tell me, the woman is in a picture with the man that I killed. My husband is sending her flowers, seeing her, and then he buys this gun without telling me. I mean, what the hell does that sound like to you? - Well, it doesn't mean your husband's trying to kill you. The records for the gun purchase show that it was bought after the break-in of your house. It's legally registered to him. Mrs. Davidson, your husband's a lawyer. He's not going to buy a gun, kill his wife, and hope to get away with it. - Then why didn't he tell me? - Well, he probably didn't want to alarm you. It's perfectly legal. He's allowed to have it. And after having a guy break into his house, I can understand why he'd want it. But, I am going to talk to the girl, and I'm going to talk to your husband. But Mrs. Davidson, in all likelihood the guy who broke into your house was intending to rob it. It's possible that your with this woman and she gave Renfrew your address. - Well, could they have been planning it together? - I'll never say never, but that's low on my list. - Well, what am I supposed to do now? - Stop playing detective. I'll let you know what we find out. I really don't know what I can tell you but I'll help you any way I can. Do you know the guy in this picture? - That's definitely me. Some Halloween party at Tommy's. That was just some guy that was there. - You two seem pretty friendly. - I guess you've never been to one of these parties. They get wild. - Okay. Then, tell me about Tom Davidson. - What about him? - Are you seeing him, romantically? - Are you two doing divorce work on the side. What the hell is this? - We're homicide detectives. Your friend here in that picture, he's dead, and we're investigating. Now let me ask you again, are you involved with Tom Davidson? - I know him. We're friends, that's all. - So, can you think of any reason why he'd want to kill his wife? - No. Sorry. - All right. Give me a call if you think of anything. No, man. They weren't just cops. - They were homicide cops. - Lisa, calm down. The only person that knows anything, besides you and me, is dead. All you have to do is keep your mouth shut. Everything will be fine. - They had that picture. That picture of me and the guy... guy... where the hell did they get that from? Who was that woman who came into the bar? - The woman obviously went to the cops. What I want to know is how the cops knew that that was you in the picture? - I dunno. - Well think. - I don't know. - Think. - But this is where it gets weird, okay? They know all about me and Tom, right? I tell them that we're just friends, but it's like they know. And then, out of the blue, they mention, "Has Tom ever wanted to kill his wife." - When did they ask you this, at the beginning or at the end of the interview? - The end. - At the end. It was at the end. This is perfect. - What? - You get it, right? - No. - Lisa. Lisa, they think the guy was trying to kill his wife. You're bonking the guy. They think he wants to get rid of his wife. This is freakin' perfect. - Sounding pretty messed up to me. - Here's what we're gonna do. We're gonna kill the wife. We frame the husband. Done deal. - No. - Yes. - No way! - Yes, way. Yes. When they discover that he had nothing to do with this, which they will, they're going to put the screws to you. That's going to lead to me. I'm already on parole, you know that, right? I got two strikes. Two. One more strike, I'm gone for life. Thanks for coming in, Mr. Davidson. You remember Detective McKenna? - Yes. I hope you know I'm taking time out of a very busy schedule for this. - Well, I appreciate that. We'll try not to keep you too long. Take a look at this. You know who those people are? - I'm sorry. - Well, that's funny because the girl knows you. Her name's Lisa Carver. Does that ring a bell? - Yeah. Yeah, I know her. We've had drinks a couple of times, that's all. So, why did you say you didn't know her? - Well, maybe because I'm a married man. And maybe I'm not too anxious for my wife to hear rumors about a woman I barely know. - Well, that's not the way Lisa tells it. - I think this interview is over. I was under the impressi - that was killed in my house. - It does. He's the guy in the picture with Lisa. - What? - That's Derrick Renfrew, last seen dead in your den. And quite happy in that picture, with his arm around the girl you were having an affair with. - I ended it before the break-in. - Yeah, we know. You sent her flowers. "Don't be afraid and don't call me." - Now, what would she have to be 'afraid' about? Was she afraid because she was planning with you to kill your wife? - Are you out of your mind? - I don't think so. You said you didn't know Lisa. You did. You said you broke up with her. Your wife tells us she saw you at Lisa's apartment yesterday. - I don't know what you're trying to pull here but if you want to make any more wild accusations, you make them to my attorney. Mr. Davidson, now you do understand why these discrepancies would concern us. - Am I under arrest? - Not yet. - Then I'm leaving. Excuse me. - I think we touched a nerve. So let's just reverse the order of these and then we'll make more copies of that, okay? - I just came from the police station. - Let's go in the conference room. And try to keep your voice down. I don't want everyone to hear this. - You really think I would try and have you killed? I mean, where did you come up with that? - Well, you're obviously having an affair and this girl knows the guy that broke into our house, who came at me with a baseball bat. Can you explain that? Explain to me why, at every step of the way, you tried to keep me from investigating this. - I didn't... - You didn't what? Come on, Tom! Just stop lying. Just stop lying and tell me the truth. Are you having an affair with this girl? - Yes. I was. - God. - It was the biggest mistake of my life, Meg. I ended it before the break-in, but she wouldn't... she wouldn't stop calling. She just wouldn't let it go. - You were at her apartment this morning. - She said she was going to call you if I didn't talk to her. So I went. Meg, I messed up. I had an affair, yes. But I didn't try to kill you. I love you. - Why did you buy a gun? - Because I was scared. Because I wanted to protect my family. - I don't knowwhat I b. I'm taking Ellie. I gotta go to my mom's house for a few days. - Meg, please... - God! Would you just shut up! I would leave you just for the infidelity. And then you pile all of this on top of it. I mean, my God, Tom, one way or the other, you brought a killer into our home! Why don't you think about that! - What's your problem? - Shut up! Don't say another word! Get out! - Why are you so freaked? - Why am I so 'freaked'? How about I just came from the police station. They think you and I conspired to kill my wife. How freaking freaky is that? - I know. They were at my place, too! - Why didn't you call me! - You said not to. - Tell me this, Lisa, did you have anything to do with that guy breaking into my house? - No! I don't even know the guy. - That's a lie! - No, it's not! I'm getting scared, Tom. I want to go. Let's go, just you and me. Let's just get the hell out of here. - Are you crazy? - Why not? The only problem we had was your family. - You get this through your skank head. If you had anything to do with sending that man to my home, I swear I will.... Walk home! - Hey, Stevie. - Hey. - What's up, Angie? - Same ol'. - Yeah? - I saw that kid you're going out with at the Grand. - Who? - Dark hair, Lisa something. - Lisa, yeah, you saw Lisa at the Grand? When? - Just yesterday. She was with some guy. Didn't seem her type. Is she hooking? - Ha. Is she hooking? This guy, what... did he have, like, short hair? Hey? Look like that jock that you used to hate in high school? - Yeah, that'd be him. Who's he? - I gotta go. What are you doing, Lisa? You are so freaking stupid, right? I can't believe it. I told you not to go anywhere near Tom Davidson. - You're not my Dad, and you don't own me, so shut the hell up. - Is that it. I'm not your dad. What do you think you're doing? Where're you going? What? You're just gonna blow out on me? Is that it? Is that what you're going to do? You're going to blow out on me, maybe Maybe go to the cops and cut yourself a little deal. Tell them I'm the one who sent Renfrew. Is that what you're doing? - If you don't get outta here, I'm going to call the cops. - Yeah? You're part of it, - all right? - You sonofabitch! - Come here! - Aahhhh! - Lis... Lisa! Lisa. Think. Tom did this. He came here. You fought. You fell. You fell and you hit your head. And then he went home and he waited for his wife. How does that sound? Next door neighbor heard the fight, slam against the wall, waited 'til he left, then called 911. - Neighbor didn't see him, though. - This is not good. - No, it is not. We'd better find Davidson. Hello? - Mrs. Davidson? This is Detective Wilson. Is your husband there? - No. I just got here. - Do you know where he is? - No, in fact, I don't. I told him I was spending a few days away and... Why, is there a problem? - Somebody attacked Lisa Carver, she's dead. - Ohmigod. Um... do you think Tom was...? - Well, I don't know. Maybe, but I'm sending an officer out there to keep an eye on you. - Well, I'm not staying here. I'm I'm getting my car and going to my mother's house. - I'll get an officer to meet you there, but leave now. - I just came back to get something for my daughter, then I'm out of here. - Fine, leave now. I'm not letting you in! I don't want to talk to you. I don't want to see you. - Meg, we need to talk about this! - Not now, okay? I'm going to call the police if you don't leave right now. - I live here! - Stop yelling. You've got to leave. Just go! Go away! - Okay, okay, I'll do whatever you want me to do. You know I love you. I would never do anything hurt you. - Detective Wilson, it's Meg Davidson. - Have you left yet? - No, I'm at the house and he's here. - He's right there in the room with you? - Well, he's sitting in his car in the driveway. - Is he acting aggressive, threatening, anything like that? - No, he hasn't threatened me. I just... I think... - I'm sending a car right away. - All right, thank you. Gulp! - This is perfect. The cops are gonna arrive and they're going to find Tom in the driveway and you dead inside the house. Just relax. It's like going to sleep. UHG! TOM! Come here! Arrragh. O - Ommmph! - You okay? It's okay. It's so beautiful out here. Yeah, this was the right idea. Just to rent a place for a little while. Come on, Ellie! It's been really good for Ellie and me. Whatcha got sweetheart? - I'm keeping these. These are my favorites. - Are they? - Hum. - This one's for you, Daddy. - Thank you, sweetheart. I will cherish that. - When are you coming back? - Next week, pumpkin. - Okay, I'll put these in my special spot. - You do that. - We miss you. - I miss you guys a lot, too. - It's good that we're taking it slow though. - I know. Doesn't make it any easier. See you next week. - Okay.
