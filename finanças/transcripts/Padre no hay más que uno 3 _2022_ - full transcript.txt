FATHER THERE IS ONLY ONE 3 Mom! Dad! Cris is crying. - Dani. - You knock before coming in. What were you doing? Sleeping. On top of each other? If you like to sleep that way, get bunk beds, like us. I told you Dani, you need to knock before coming in. On top of everything! - Go see Cris, it's your turn. - Why's it always my turn? Because it was always my turn with the other five. We'd have to have four more kids to be even. Go on. Ho Ho Ho! Merry Christmas everyone. Javier, don't start. It's only December fourth. This year I don't want to see a single decoration until at least the fifteenth. Don't do the same thing you always do, I'm warning you. Dang. Great Christmas spirit you got there. Who'll give me toast and jelly? Check this out. It's been like this for days. She wants to be a lottery singer. I'm practicing for casting. Dear, there's no casting. Every year the lottery is sung by the kids from St Ildefonso School. I'll change schools then. Of course, we'll get right on that! - No Dad, no! - What? You almost sat on her imaginary friend. What? That's all I need now. Not enough of us now? Now an imaginary friend to boot? Leave her alone. The shrink says it's only a phase. Fine. I just don't want to give up my chair. Look, just sit in mine. I'm going shopping with Carmen and your mom. Don't forget my dad's train gets here at one. Yeah. Yeah. It's not soon enough to decorate yet. But not too soon for your dad's visit. Come on! Since we moved there's so much more space. And my dad needs his family more than ever. So stop with the decorations and give my dad some love. Lights and a Nativity are tradition the kids are waiting for all year. It's not enough to have this live Nativity scene we have going here? 'Scuse me. Gotta go. True. This year we even have a Nativity crapper. Behave. Hey! We have to talk to Sara. It can't go on like this it can't be right. This guy's in the house at breakfast time, as if he were one of the kids. That guy has a name. Yeah. Eight. What kind of a name is that? We gotta stop it. Suggestions? There's no way to separate them. Look, I prefer them to be here, where I can watch them. But it's unbelievable that I can't relax in my own home without running into him. Come on. Come on? Good morning, Dad. 'Sup, Dad. No toilet paper left. Bring some? Whatcha doin', Dad? Easy there. He's a bottomless pit. Every time I go to the fridge, what I want's gone. Please, don't you be a child, too. We already have six. Seven, if you count Eight. And don't forget to pick up my dad. Marisa, why are you doing this to me? You know I can't stand your dad. Since you can't stand your mom, either. I don't worry about it. You dad's always making out like he's the victim. But he is the victim. My mom left him for a guy who's twenty years younger. I'd like to see you if I did that to you. You wouldn't dare. Try me. Wow, what a miracle! There's actually some juice! Hey, hey! But it's mine. I labeled everything I brought with my name. For my own use. But hey dad, you can have some. Just a second here, kid. Don't you have a home? Dad! Duly noted. "Juice" added to the grocery list. And I'm off. Maybe you go too? And go home a while. Dad! Fine, dad. I get it. You don't have to tell me things twice. No, you're right. It has to be twenty times. No, No. Take it easy, I'm leaving. But it's my juice. Dad, how could you? I really don't know, dear. I'm in shock. Oh yeah? Well if he goes, I'm going with him. Wow, rid of two in one shot. More room for the Nativity. We gotta finish, before she gets back. Who's going to help? Me! I'll rehearse while I help too. If you're going to do that we don't need you. One less. It's an epidemic. I don't know why you want to spend your money on baby clothes when I have so much. No offense, but I don't want my kid to wear seventh generation hand-me-downs. Not to you, but to me, a kid is something very special. I just set aside an adorable pyjama. No, leave that. I don't like that color at all. I can't stand her anymore. Can you take her for a few days? Me? With Javier, the six kids, Rosaura, the dog and Sara's boyfriend? AND, my dad arrives today. She's always in my face. - Your dad arrives today? - You see? He's in a funk, poor thing. My mother left him. What are you saying? But your dad's such a charmer. Lady! Leave that alone. I set it aside! The red one's pretty. Untangle the lights. Mom's gonna kill you. You promised you'd wait 'til the 15th. But if it's all set up when she comes she won't take it down. And this is almost ready. It's only missing Baby Jesus. Don't even think of touching him. The tradition in our family is to put Baby Jesus in his manger on Christmas Eve. Which is when he was born. It's an heirloom. Your great grandfather bought it at the Plaza Mayor. When your grandpa was a baby. And ever since, it's passed on the generations. I remember that every Christmas Eve, I placed baby Jesus in his manger. It's my favorite memory of him. Cool! And this year it'll be me. You? Why you? Because you said your dad let you do it. It was your favorite memory. Of course. And I don't want you to break baby Jesus and ruin it. So my only memory'll be you don't let me mess with anything? You mess with my nerves. Why don't you help unravel the lights? It's more fun. You know how bad the lights are? And what they do to the environment? And it's ridiculous lighting the house on December fourth. Everything embarrasses you. If I comment on your Insta, if I pinch your cheeks in front of your friends. When you were young you acted older. She's just going through "buperty". You also "barass" me, Dad. Dad, if he was born December 24th, why didn't the three Wise Men arrive until the 6th? 'Cause they came from the Orient. Jesus was born in Bethlehem, It wasn't that far from them. Yeah! And Santa Claus, came from the North pole! Sure! But he was on a flying sled and the Wise Men rode on camels. Dad, don't even. Santa Claus didn't come to the manger. He wasn't invited? It wasn't exactly like that. It's just that the manger had no chimney. He could come through the door. Look Dani, do you see any doors here? Well, it's almost finished. The lights coming along? Paula, what's this? I'm going to turn her on. Don't you dare! What a mess. Dad, have you registered me at the school yet? Dad, you need to go get grandpa. You're right. Carlota, untangle your sister. Rocío, come with me. We have to talk. Okay. Listen, kids. When we get back with Grandpa Agustin you have to be especially kind to him. Because Grandma's left him and he's very sad. Where did she leave him? The station, dummy, that's why we're going to get him. Why did she leave him at the station? What I mean is that Grandma and Grandpa are no longer living together. That's why he's coming here. So he won't be alone at Christmas. So grandma's not coming on Christmas Eve? No. But Grandma Milagros is coming. One of each, like in the Nativity. There's the ass. And the ox. One of each. Which one is Grandma? The ass or the ox? Well, we'll be back later. Please Carlota, watch your brother and sisters. Dani, you watch your sisters. This is a mess. And I have to study. I'm upstairs, okay? What're you doing? Dad's going to kill you. I just want to put him in the manger because Dad's not going to let me. Then I'll put him away. Hang on. Hey, no! I want to be the one to do it! No! It's mine. I had the idea! No, me! Cris, come here. Watch the door. Paula, bring me the glue. Hand me the right arm. Which is the right? Oh, God. What's happening here? Nothing. It's okay. We got it. As you can see, nothing happened. What have you done? It's better than before, now it looks like Chucky! And it's missing a foot. That's not our fault. A foot's missing. It's nowhere, I looked. No worries, when Jose Luis poops, we'll get it back. Or if not, we'll put socks on him, 'cause it's winter. As for the rest, he's perfect. Dad's going to kill you. He'll kill you first, that's the pecking order. You're in as much trouble as us. Look Rocío, you can't sing the lottery numbers because that's the day of the school play. And you play the Virgin Mary every year. You can't let them down. The play is in the afternoon. Besides, who cares? They picked someone else this year. Someone else? But you do it every year. They said I grew too much and I'm not cute anymore. What do you mean cute? It's the Virgin Mary, not a Care Bear! They picked someone with no resume. Just 'cause she's blonde. Blonde? Where have you ever seen a blonde Virgin Mary? The Virgin Mary was Jewish. Don't worry. This can't be. Monday I'll go to school and clear it up. Don't worry, Dad. I prefer to change schools and sing the lottery numbers. So I can be on T.V. How can you compare being the star of the school play with pulling out balls from a drum where you won't even be seen? Leave it to me. I'll get your role back. Okay. But if not, I'll change schools and sing the lottery numbers. Deal? Okay, deal. But you have to be very affectionate with Grandpa Agustín. Show me how good an actress you are. Thanks, Dad. I love you. Love you too, dear. I just showed you. Look, there's Grandpa. - Agustín, how are you? - Grandpa! Grandpa, oh grandpa! Nice welcome, eh? No complaints. But I have six grandkids and only one came. It's just that the rest can't act. Let's go, let's go. So how is school going? Well, it's a constant source of stress. Let's talk about you. How are things with you? She's going through a prissy phase. Dad told us that Grandma left you. No, Rocío. You didn't quite get that right. She let him, not left him spend Christmas here. You need permission when you're a grown-up, too? This torture is never going to stop. Where're we gonna find a baby just like this one before Christmas Eve? Dad said they bought it at a stand in the Plaza Mayor. But that was when his dad was little. Yeah, and that was ten or twenty years ago. No way! You're exaggerating! Those are run by family. Maybe it's still around. We have to get Grandpa Agustín to take us to the Plaza Mayor and pray they still have one like it. Let's get a picture. We're here, come greet your Grandpa! Keep them busy while I hide this and put it back later. Kids? Grandpa! Hey! Such enthusiasm! Dani, you're so handsome! You, Paulita! She's Cris! Grandpa, I'm Paula! You're Paulita? I thought you'd be Carlota! I'm Carlota, Grandpa. Oh my God, you're all so big! Because you're two steps down. - That makes a difference. - It probably does. I'm here. Don't tell me she's Sara? So droll. No, she's our housekeeper, Rosaura. She's like family. No touching. Pleased to meet you. Likewise. We've already put Rocío in the little one's room so take her bedroom. No, absolutely not. I don't want to put anyone out. I'll find a nearby hotel. No man, no. It doesn't have to be nearby. No, what I mean is you're not leaving here. Right kids? - No! No! - No! I know I'm in the way wherever I go. Thanks for faking it. - Not at all. That's what we're here for. - Hey! How about some chips, dad? I couldn't eat a thing. I have no appetite. Oh, Dad! How exciting! Hello Agustín, you're looking so handsome! We're aware that Pilar left you for someone else. Well, and Marisa also told us not to bring it up so you don't feel pathetic. So tactless! Milagros, for God's sake. Just remind him he's 20 years younger and rub salt in the wound. I'm going to unpack. Hey, count on me for whatever you need. Oh yeah, he's bad off. You were right. Thank God we didn't bring anything up. I'll lend you a hand Dad. And you and I need to talk. Don't think I haven't noticed that you set up this Christmas fair in here so soon. Looks like the windows at Bergdorf. Looks good, eh? So where are Sara and Eight now? I'll call them. No, don't smother them. They'll have lunch when they get here. Besides, we need their places at the table to seat your mom, and my mom, who insisted on staying for lunch. Alright then. Lunchtime! Not there, Dad! That's where my friend sits. Your imaginary friend? Well then, imagine this imagine a chair; he can sit there. Good one. We pay the shrink a lot. It could have occurred to her. Grandpa, could you take us this afternoon to see the Christmas lights? That's a great idea Paula, that way we can give Mom and Dad alone time for once. That's wonderful, kids. It sounds amazing. Agustín? Sure. That's great. - I'll come with you. - No need for that, Milagros. No need for that at all. Thanks. Of course I will. You can't go alone with all those kids with the streets packed with people. No chance. I appreciate it, both of you. Yeah, thanks a lot! See how you are useful, Agustín? I don't know what we parents would do without grandparents. Right? Grandma, are you the ass or the ox? What? Dad says that you and Grandpa are the ass and the ox, but which is which? Kids. - Let's see. - No. - What are you talking about? - Nothing, it's nothing. You're not in some kind of mess? I can't let anything taint my rep when I sing out the lottery numbers all the media outlets will be watching me. Yeah, right. Better you don't know anything. I demand to know. I don't want it to be the last to know when it's in the papers. You live in la la land. You will too, when I tell Mom and Dad there's something up. Wait. It's not serious. It's just that we accidentally broke the baby Jesus. That's why we asked Grandpa to take us to see the lights. To buy the same figure at the Plaza Mayor. - Come on Grandpa, please! - Come on, this way! How are we going to get into the Plaza, kids? There're too many people. - But Dad always takes us. - Please. Come on, it's a tradition. Okay, fine. Get in single file by order of size. I'm going to tie your scarves together. What are you doing? I don't want them to get lost. But if one of them starts running, he'll choke the rest. That's the idea. So no one can run. Come on, come on. You're idea's half-assed. You're going to choke them. Come on, to the Plaza Mayor. Okay. But everybody stick together. I don't want to end up like the grandpa in "La Gran Familia". No worries, Grandpa. We're fine. Yeah, fine pieces of work you are. Yikes, we shouldn't have come. What a lot of people. Grandpa, could we go see something - right here at this stand? - No, no! I don't want what happens in "La Gran Familia" to happen to us screaming out your name 'cause we can't find you. Chencho, Chencho! What's that, Grandpa? It's a legendary movie, sweetie. Yeah, it's legendary alright. More than 50 years old. You've got to get with the times. We can see one you and I. We'll go to this stand right here. - I said, no. No! - Come on, Grandpa! - Just a minute. - I said no! When I say no, I mean no! - Absolutely not! - We'll be careful. At least stay close so that I can see you! We shouldn't have come. Oh come on. Put on this reindeer headband, at least. Yeah sure, that's all I need. To put some cuckold horns on my head. Come on, you. It's Christmas! I don't know. It doesn't feel Christmasy when you put on a wig like that. That's for Carnival season. Boy, you're such a nudge. I admit that the thing with my wife hit me hard. It's taken the life outta me. Aw, don't be that way. I always thought you were better than her, but never said it before. Well, she left me for a hot guy, twenty years my junior. Well... I said you're better than her, not better than him. Excuse me. Excuse me. Do you have this Baby Jesus? No. But that's pretty old, right? My great-grandpa bought here years ago. Is the stand still here? Manolo's been here forever. His father was a seller. Ask him. Manolo! Take care of this kid! You deserve a woman good enough for you. An interesting elegant woman with class. Where can I find a woman like that? I don't know any. Cris! What Cris? The baby! - Oh, the baby! Cris! - Where's Cris? - Oh no, the baby! - Cris! - Cris! - Cris! - Oh my, where is she? - Cris! Cris! Cris! They're from my grandpa's time, don't know if they still make 'em. Call me here tomorrow night and I'll let you know. If I can get one for you. Thanks. It's really important for us. Oh, and another very important thing. Do you have exploding stink bombs? We lost Cris. We're here. We can't find her! Calm down. She always does this. - Huh? - As soon as she finds a place to hide... Look. She always does this? And you didn't tell us? - Unbelievable. - Come here sweetie. Come on, come on. We're going home. Oh, one thing, not at word about this to your parents. Okay, so for Christmas eve, it'll be the six kids, the two of us, my mother-in-law, my dad, Carmen, Paco and you, of course. Me? If I don't win the lottery. Because if I do I'm outta here and might come back, or not. Rosaura, please. That makes my blood pressure drop. Hey, isn't it pretty late for them to still be out? Don't worry. My dad's very, very responsible. I'm referring to Sara and her twin. They've been gone all day. You wanted them out of the house. There you have it. I would prefer them to be here. - Hi! - Hello. At last! Sweetie, you're here alone? Without your twin? Miracle! Dad, you were right. We hang too much. I was thinking about what you said and I think I'm going to ask him to take a break. Well done, sweetie. Of course. But are you okay? Yeah, sure. Besides, I realize Eight isn't really my type. Someone like him is more for me. Like who? - Let's see. - You're going to flip! His name is Big Bambini. He's a super-cool trapper. Tons of followers. Did you see that? Come on! He's famous and has millions of followers. He doesn't know her. They'll never meet in real life. - They'd better not. - Yes. Hey! How'd it go? Really good. Our grandparents didn't lose Cris. Did I say it right, Grandpa? Why are you crushing my hand? Come on, take off your coats. Let's have dinner. Alright. Big Bambini gave me a like on a comment I made on his post. What's she saying? Wow. Didn't you say there was no chance? I did. I've been warning you since her first boyfriend, buy you don't listen. Give up right now. 'Cause if you don't, they get worse. Look at how your wife ended up. Well, I'm off to Paco's house. All we need is that you sleep here, too. I wanted to talk about that, son. I was thinking of staying a few days - to help with everything. - No! There's no more room here. Where there's room for nine, there's room for ten. I'm going to be honest. I had a tiff with your sister-in-law. What? She says she needs privacy. Why? Privacy. As if I wasn't discreet. I don't want to be where I'm not wanted. So why do you want to come here then? What a riot my son is. Tonight I'll pack and move in tomorrow. Bye, Agustín. You rest, eh? - Good night. - Good night. Yes. Forget about it after tomorrow. Sweetheart, is she really going to come live here? No. Not if I can help it. Hey, Paco. What up with your wife practically throwing Mom out? What? It was her! Since Agustín's arrival, she's dying to be there. Just what I needed. Now that I was free of Sara's boyfriend. What a pain. I'd run into him everywhere. Hey! 'Sup, Dad? You're here? Been working a month. He's a good kid. very responsible. I wanted to buy Sara a gift for our anniversary. Only a few more deliveries. I'm taking it to her tomorrow night. Now I feel sorry for him. Hey Dad! I'll see you at home tonight, eh? Don't raid the fridge, eh? It's a shame he's so dumb. Cris, watch the door. I'm calling the stand. Watch the door. Hello? Hi. I'm calling about the old-fashioned Baby Jesus. Oh yeah, hi. I'm afraid it's bad news. Not made anymore. Darn. There's good news. There's a web page where they could've had them. - Good! - Good! Too bad they don't have them. The good thing is I found another one. And the bad thing? No, nothing bad. Here's the link to the dealer. Good luck. It does exist. Here it is. Expensive? - Ten euros? - More. More? 350 euros. 350 euros? No one has that kind of money. We need a plan. Each of us has to think of a plan to raise money before Christmas Eve. What's wrong? Now I feel sorry for that kid, Eight. You know he's working at Paco's to save for a gift for Sara? He'll give it to her tomorrow, and she'll dump him. Life's tough. And you still haven't seen your kid's video. She's probably dancing and being cute, like they all do now. Have you actually seen the dance? What's wrong, two left feet? What's with her butt? Oh my Lord! Don't freak out. But Big Bambini "liked" it. You said he didn't know her? Sure, 'cause that's what I thought. But now he's following her. He's following here? On Instagram. Following her on Instagram. We have to nip this in the bud. Sweetie. Look, I've been thinking that Eight is really a good kid. Maybe you'd better think it over. Now you like him? Dad, he's a nerd! He doesn't even have 300 followers on Instagram. No Twitch account. I can't be with him. It's embarrassing. Don't be that way, sweetie. What's Twitch? I'll follow him. Too late. I just did it. Really? Yeah, tomorrow was our anniversary. Seemed harsh to do it tomorrow. So I just whatsapped him. Dumped by Whatsapp? Yeah, right? It's so 2021. I shoulda just blocked him. But I wanted to be proper. Big Bambini liked me again! Dad. What's wrong? Sara dumped me, Dad. Are you going out without a fight? What can I do? She doesn't love me. Sure she does. She does love you. Wow! Thanks, Dad. I thought you disliked me. Can't stand you. But you're better than the other. What other? Listen up. We'll meet tomorrow at the high school lot. - We'll strategize. - Cool. Remember, mum's the word. She finds out, and I'm dead and you're toast. Over 'n out. Hey, hey, dad? Bring my food in the fridge? It could go bad before we hookup again. Weren't you distraught? Lose your love, lose your appetite. Sure, but this has gotten me hopeful again. Big Bambini liked my post again. This makes three. Wow. Dad, how many presents can we put in this year's Christmas letter? Three each. One from each of the Three Wise Men. Just three? Okay, and one small one, for the road. Keep in mind all the letters they get. Reminds me, you need to start to do yours. And how about my imaginary friend? Of course. But his gifts will also be imaginary, like him. I already know what I want. A rugby helmet, a sword and shield, and a lotta cars. But don't tell me. Put it in a letter. But with good penmanship. So it's clear. Rocio, Rehearsal's today. The turbid matter of the Virgin has to be sorted. Okay, everybody out. So have you thought about how to get the money? I thought we could go around the neighborhood caroling, like in the movies. Yeah! And I can do solos. Great, they'll pay us money just to shut you up. Thanks to Paula's imaginary friend I just thought of a moneymaker and if it goes well, we'll get rich! Great, we'll talk about it later, then. The hell? You told me to be quiet. Bit too much. - Did you bring my food? - Yeah, here. Excellent. All there? I think so. Hey, I'm missing a carton of gazpacho. That was my breakfast. Shut up. Listen. I know why Sarah's lost interest. You don't have enough TikTok, Instagram or Tweech followers, or whatever. You have to get followed big. I've been boning up. You know Don Tomato? That's the guy that jumps from buildings, right? - And from rooftops. - Almost two million followers on Instagram. But Dad, you expect me to do that? No, man. A million is enough. I'm not seeing it, Dad. Sure, man. We'll put down the mattress, It'll be fine. We'll cut this part out. I'm not seeing it. Come on. Jump. No, Dad. I'll be killed. But it's just a few stairs. Do you value Sara's love? A lot. But on smaller steps. Come on. Don't think. Do it. It's like jumping in the pool. Okay. Here goes. Dad. I'm dead. Relax. You're fine. We don't have to erase this since you didn't even hit it. I'm going to make you an offer you can't refuse. You have the opportunity to participate in the deal of a lifetime. Yeah sure, like that tooth fairy hoax. Here's how it goes: The tooth fairy follows my orders. Really? From now on, if you want to get any money, you have to give me your teeth. And then we got nothing. Yeah. Because he got away from me. But I'm paying up, right? I'll give you all the teeth I lose so you can get the money. You didn't have that space there yesterday. Hand it over. Now we're even. About this new deal? Shoot. How many presents are you allowed to ask for? We get three. Four, if they're small. Me too. What if I tell you I can get you one more that you're not allowed to put on your list? How? There're so many of us at home and each year a new one's born, if there's one more list they won't notice. Go on. The plan is to make a fake list that has a gift for each of you on it. In name of my imaginary brother. And then I'll bring them to school for you. And you? What's in it for you? The "modeck" amount of ten euros a head. It's modest. That would be more. Too much. Too much? A scooter costs more. I'm the one at risk. If I get caught, I'm the one who isn't getting anything. I'm in. Me too. I don't even have 10 euros. I think it's shady. My principles won't let me participate. But I'll tell my brother, who has no scruples. Okay. Okay, but if you fool us again... It's not safe to do this at the school. Ask your parents to take you to the park at six. Until then, disperse. We shouldn't be seen together. Come on, kids! Playtime's over! Come on. Let's go. Okay kids, let's start. Gabriela, arrange them on stage. - Ready. - Hey, shepherd three. About time. Where were you? Come on. Quick, you're late! Of course. I should've known you were behind all this. I was chosen unanimously to direct the play. If you'd tried out... What was the criteria for your daughter to be the top billing? Don't call the Virgin Mary the "top billing" furthermore Cloe's cute and has an angelical face. Well if it's so angelical, she should play an angel. She'd love floating over the manger. Paulita's already the angel. What's she doing there? Beast, you're gonna kill her! Put up yours! Dani's a King. And Cris is a lamb. Should I fire all the kids that aren't yours so it's solely your offspring? It isn't fair, she always had top billing. You can't just demote her like that. What experience does Cloe have? Two films. Mine's been on "Top Singer Kids". She didn't get in. That's an idea. A try out! May the best girl win. Absurd. Scared of the competition? I'm going to suggest it at the PTA meeting. We can hold auditions. With a jury of objective moms. Fine. I'm not afraid of you. Fine. My kids are coming with me. Kids! Get Paulita down, we're leaving. - Did you get me the part? - Of course. Just a small bureaucratic detail and everything's legal. - What? - An audition. - But you're experienced. - Yeah, in not getting in. Because you needed talent for that. But this's a done deal. No worries. Rocio, Rocio. Do you want to meet up to prepare an audition? Who're you, young man? St, Joseph. Charmed. Okay. Call your parents and we'll arrange a rehearsal, asap. An honor. Anything to be near your daughter. I'm her respectful fervent admirer. Great. Dad, why invite him to rehearse? He's a pain. He's not a pain, he has top billing. Are you taking this seriously, or not? Look, it's important to have chemistry on stage. You gotta be on the same page for that. Thank God I'm changing schools. Come on guys, let's practice caroling. One, two, three. Ring the bells of Bethlehem. The angel choirs sing to bring us good tidings. Sounds awful. But that's perfect. They'll give anything to shut us up. I think we'll have to go to more or less ten houses. Because if we get five from each that'll be fifty. My plan has begun. - Tomorrow I get 40 euros from my friends. - But Dani, You really think the Wise Men are that dumb? They see everything. Besides, at this point, they know about it. Another idea, please. And you, Paulita? - I already got some cash. - You did? I won it at school today. Listen, kids! - Do you know where frogs breathe from? - No. Through their gills. Look. Paulita, if you kiss the frog I'll give you a euro. Kiss it? Yuck. But if you give me five, I'll eat it. Don't have the balls. Gross! Mom says we gotta try everything, eh? What? It's dinner time. What's going on here? If we tell you, we'd have to kill you. Cris, you tell me. We should tell her so she can help. Help what? We broke the Baby Jesus statue. What? Dad's gonna kill you. He loves that more than Cris. Cris, you've only been here two years. He isn't as attached. This means trouble. For you. You're an accomplice. What? Help us, or we'll say it was you, in an attack of teenage rebellion. You wouldn't! Sure, 'cause I'm just a little kid. And Rocio and Carlota are teepreens. But you're a "Neentager". And you? How 'bout it? For the cause, I'll give half the money from lottery singing. Unreal! - Dinnertime, kids! - Come on. Come on, Cris. I'll call Mr. Agustín to dinner. Very well. I can't believe it. Eight is pathetic. Look at the video he's posted. That's what you call biting the dust! How could I have been with him for more than two years? Thanks for helping me open my eyes, Dad. Poor guy. Aren't you sorry he got hurt? Yeah, he's sorry, alright. He says he'll skip dinner. Doesn't want to bother anyone. Intermittent fasting. Very healthy. - Dinner! - No! Fish again! I'll take a pass. The girls are right. Fish? It's Christmas. I'll order some pizza. - Yeah! - Yes! Pizza! What about my dinner? Should I throw it out? Your wife's gonna know. Yeah, she'll know for sure. The first part of my plan was successful. The video? Not exactly. She felt sorry. But it's a start. Now the second part of the plan. I'm ordering pizzas so you can deliver them and talk to her. It was your anniversary, maybe it'll soften her. Dad, how am I gonna deliver pizzas? After the fall, I'm hurt. Are you gonna let that stop you? Take a taxi, I got it. Go the pizzeria, don't whine. - The pizzas are ready - The pizzas are ready. Sara, the money, go get 'em. - Why me? - You're the oldest. Go on. Eight? Why are you here? I work at your uncle's pizzeria. What? To get you a gift for our anniversary. Oh. It was today. What's that getup? Christmas. Your uncle's idea. It's ridiculous. How'd it go? She said I'm ridiculous. But a good kind of ridiculous. Right? Are you guys gonna eat two whole pizzas? I haven't had any dinner. I'll bring you something. Here. Enjoy. Still mad about the pizzas? It was to help the kid. He's a good kid. And he loves her. You're a cool cucumber. Big Bambini "liked" Sara three times already. Oh no. Three likes. Three likes equals three years of dating. Sara's little confused. She doesn't know what she wants. I do know what I want. An adult husband, not another kid. But when we're alone I'm pretty adult. What's more, we should plan date nights at least one a week. Let's take advantage. My dad's here! Done! Tomorrow I take you to dinner! Candles, romantic music... I can't believe it. What's that noise and at twelve midnight. Hey, baby, you're mine. I can't believe it! The Big Bambini! Hey, baby, you're mine. Duko's in Madrid now, 'cause you're that fine. Brown-haired girl, whatch'a say? 'Cause we already had 3 rolls in the hay. Yeah, yeah. This is so nice, right, sir? Like when you sent mariachis to get me back. - What mariachis? - She's hallucinating. How did they get our address? Sara probably knows. So he'd send an autographed picture. But this is much better. Gentlemen! Disperse! I wouldn't want to have to call the police. Dad, stop! Brown-haired girl, whatch'a say? 'Cause we already had 3 rolls in the hay. Yeah, yeah. - Did he say two rolls in the hay? - Yes. Brown-haired girl, whatch'a say? Come on, I'm giving you a heads up. I'm a little crazy. Disperse! Take it easy, Sir. I just want to serenade your lass... I wrote this song to dedicate it to her ass. Careful, this nutjob could break our stuff. Dad I'll never speak to you again! Let's see how that goes. 'Cause that's the 5th time you say that this year. Shut up already! These kids are a royal pain! Excuse me! Dad, how much will I get for singing the lottery? That's not paid, sweetie. You give away money all morning and you don't get a cent. Cripes. If you want, I'll pay you to forget that idea and snag the audition. St. Joe rehearses with you today. How much for forgetting for the time being? Name the price, you stop that damn melody every time you talk. Alright. But I need the money. What for? I'm saving up for something. How 'bout your list? I need it before then. Why? Dad, Dad! If the school principal calls today, don't pick up. Why would they call? What's going on? Nothing. That's why I said not to pick up. Behave, guys. The Wise Men are watching. They see everything. We're here. End of the line. - Outta the car. - Bye, Dad! Have a great day. Your siblings are acting strange. You know something. Don't laugh. Don't laugh. I want to go to the ball pit. The ball pit? I'll take you there! But only when you confess, rascal. The day you finally talk. Dad, we have to stop seeing each other this way. Of course. Listen carefully. We hit a snag. That trapper is on the prowl. Yesterday he showed up and sang Sara a trap, a horrible trap. Horrific, terrible, something awful. Compared to him Bad Bunny is Shakespeare. Shakespeare? No idea who that is. Is he a new Youtuber? Look, we gotta write a better trap, better than his. If not, she's gone to you. I saw the video. He posted on his channel. Half a million views. You're in it. I'm in it? How am I in it? Damn. I wrote you a lyric. Learn it we'll make a video. Dad, you know trap? Do I know trap? Of course I do! I'm a YouTube star with half a million views. That's actually true. I swear she ate a frog. - Really? - Seriously? Come 'ere, Paula. I told them what you did. We'll each give you five euros if you eat a roach. What? Are you crazy? Five each. Bring it here. - Leave her in the seat. - No, no. No. She's not getting away from me again. Wow, so scared that women want get away from you, never noticing the ones that want to be close. Dani? What about Dani? Where is he? Right over there with his friends. Relax! Looks like you only value things that are far away from you. So I'm changing benches, ungrateful bore. You're no fun. - Did you bring the money? - Yes. Great. I just have to write the letter. Let's see I'll explain. I've decided not to fool the Wise Men. Chickening out? Too risky. They aren't dumb. But I need the money. I decided to write my own letter to the Wise Men with your gifts. You're giving up your gifts? No choice. It's for a good cause. If you trick us again. No way. I brought a pen and paper to make the list together and put it in the mailbox now. I want a scooter. I want an official Real Madrid ball. They're not going to go for that. I'm an Atleti fan. Right! I want something you won't want to keep. They won't fall for it. Put the ball on your list and something they'll believe on this one. Okay. A Hot Wheels garage. Okay, an UNO game. A Barbie dreamhouse. My brother Fernando doesn't let me play with his. That can happen. Now let's see you put in in the mailbox. Yeah. We don't trust you. I will. I will. Come on. Why's he sitting on a different bench? I'm sitting here because he's dumb. He can't see I'm courting him. Men. Men. Grandpa. What's courting? Courting? You do it when you like someone. You court when you like someone? It's an expression. Why do you ask? Because Grandma says she doesn't know how to court you. Seriously? Okay. Tell her this. That's a euro. A euro? Here. Grandma. Grandpa says you're more beautiful from afar. Is that a compliment or an insult? Come on, again, Rocío. Dad, we rehearsed a million times. I wanna go to the park too. To the park? Didn't you want to be a star? Fame is costly. And here is where it gets expensive, it's work. I'm gonna kill you. I already had her shepherd costume ready. Now I have to make another! Also finish Dani's and the angel for Paulita. And the sheep costume for Cris. - What? - Kindergardeners are sheep. That's too much. If she's a sheep, cover her in glue and roll her in cotton. Good idea. What a mom. Must I remind you, you wrapped Paula in tape and called it a tree costume? I did what I could. You were on vacation. I might just go again. No, my love. Forgive me. Forgive me. Rocio, again. Joseph, oh dear. I'm tired, I fear. If shelter we can't find, where will I have our child? Just in time. Here's St. Joseph. - Good afternoon. - Come in. Come on in, St. Joseph. Like I said. I'm tired. I'm going to my room. Well... Sorry, Fernandito. You know how stars can be. That's okay. I'm happy just to be here. You know I'm deeply in love with your daughter and my intentions are honest. You've got my blessing. I just can't speak for her. If I have your blessing, I'll tell her how I feel right now. I thought you'd be against the age difference. Age difference? Rocio and you - are in the same class. - Rocio? Yes, but I'm in love with your daughter Carlota. Bring them here. There's a card. I'll read it to you. I know it by heart. Yes my love longing for freedom what will she do, dearest madame, flying wounded and not requited? It's mine, in the style of Góngora. Lovely, Fernandito. Let's put these flowers in water. What a freak. Freak? He's a perfect son-in-law. Sure you don't like him? Dad! A little younger than you, but... A little? He called me madame! Well, guys, I'm leaving. Be good to your Grandpa, eh? Bye, Rosaura. Enjoy. Bye, Rosaura. Come here guys. It has to be today. Rosaura has the night off and Dad and Mom have a date. And Grandpa? It's all under control. Mom, Carmen and I were waiting all week to see a movie. I'm on chapter 346 of this Turquish series. To see how these two end up together. I'll bite the jugular of whoever tries to change the channel. Hello? Grandpa says that he'd like to take you out to dinner if you like. What? Yes, yes. If you haven't eaten yet he'd like to take you out. Yes, yes. Tell him yes! Well I have to go. Put on whatever you like. What's going on? Someone die? Yes. An old friend from the village. Very suddenly. Going to the wake. It's awful, awful. - Yes! - Paco! No need to celebrate. Perfect. Now Grandpa. Come in. What's wrong? Nothing, I'm spying on your grandma Pilar on Facebook and she blocked me. Unreal. Right? So immature. No, it's unreal that Facebook is still around. Grandma Milagros just called to invite you to dinner. That too? Why does every thing happen to me? Grandpa. It'll do you good. I'm not in the mood, besides. I can't leave you all. Grandpa, I'll take care of everything. If you go, that's one less for me to take care of. Okay, I'll go. Just to take the pressure off you. Okay. But go now. The night is short. You're wearing that to a wake? Too much? Well, this way it looks like I loved her more. Grandpa, you look great! I'm just dressed normally. Normal, for a date. What date? I'm off. Sara, Carlota, I can trust you, right? If you get me in trouble, your parents will kill me. I left you my cell number. And the restaurant's in case I have no coverage, or my battery runs out, or... Relax, Grandpa. Okay. Run. I'm here. Where are you going? We're just caroling. This is my official caroling outfit. Whatever, we gotta do the whole neighborhood before Mom and Dad get back. When they give us money, we run to the next. Come on. Wish me luck. They're here. Luck for a wake? Of course, going to a wake at my age, you wish me luck. So I won't be next. You know I'm also glad that lady died? Are we bad people? No. We're human. I kinda... don't want the TV now that we're alone... You rascal. Your mom's gone, but the baby's still here. Carmen, it doesn't see anything. Your mom says that when she gets into bed to warm up her feet when you're asleep. What? No way! We have to get rid of her! But Javier asked me to bear with her a little longer. There's no more room at his place. Why is it my fault that they had one kid after another like a hen house? Your mother had exactly two. So you have to take her half and half. My sons adore me. They're always fighting over me. I live with each of them equally so they won't fight. I'm envious. I have the feeling I'm not wanted anywhere. Tonight the kids practically forced me to go out. Oh. Thanks a lot. Forgive me, Milagros. I've not been myself lately. And I'm not good at faking it. I'm terrible at it too. I also tried to fool Carmen and Paco. I told them that I went to a wake... And it seems it's true. Is that a snicker? What was that? Kids. Not kids? No, no, dear. Relax. It must be a wounded animal. I'll go look. Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer... What's this? It looks like a dogfight out here. If you give us five euros, we'll go somewhere else. Are you extortionists? I'll give you two, and you'll leave. Just two? So little. We'll sing another. Stop! Out! Out!! Back, back! Don't come around again. Pleasure doing business with you. Sure. The bells are ringing and one rings above all. Ole. Look how the fish drink in the river. They drink, they drink, and then they drink some more. The shepherds of Bethlehem. 'Scuse me. What time is it? Eleven. Eleven! Off to Bethlehem, the King of the angels is born. Run, run, run! This is fantastic. I can't believe it. When was the last time we went to dinner just you and me? At least since Cris was born. See how my dad coming was a good idea? But I'm a little worried, honey. He looks... Unhappy. You're very funny. Yes. I never thought I'd laugh again. Milagros, that name says it, you're quite the miracle! How sweet of you! You also make me feel like your name says. Agustin, Comfy. See? You keep 'em coming! - Yes. - How had I never noticed? 'Cause you were sad. Your wife should be called Anguish. What're you doing? She's there. Who? My wife! Milagros? - Milagros! - Wow. Hey! What are you doing here? I'm in the city for a few days with my fella. But don't tell the family I'm here. I'd be forced to go visit the kids. Besides. I think Agustin is with them. Yes, yes. I believe he's around. What a pain. I had to block him on Facebook. Let's hope he finds a woman who can stand him. My poor daughter... Maybe he already has. And you? - Dining alone? - No, no, no. My date's in the bathroom. - Ah. - If you wait around, I'll introduce you. I would love you to meet him. We were just leaving. Well then. Have a great time. And you. Come on, Marcel. Marcel. Oh. And you can come out from under the table, Agustin. How ridiculously pathetic. You think? Why would you do that at your age? Didn't want her to see us together. Why not? She was with that great-looking guy. Precisely why. Come on! I hope they're not home yet! Hey, Mom and Dad! Careful! I don't think they saw us. - Now, now! - Come on! - Run, get your coats off. - I got Cris. Come on, guys. Everyone to their room. - Come on. You close the window. - On my way. Hello. Hello. Way too silent. They're already in bed? Strange! Here already? You have a nice time? - Very nice, dear. - Yes. Didn't hear you come in. Back already? Carry on. Rocio, please. Leave that already. Mom, the audition is tomorrow. We've practiced enough. Come on. To bed. Come here. That was close! Let's see how much we have so far. I have the 40 euros I promised. Dani, you can't fool the Wise Men. I know. I didn't make a fake list in the end. I changed mine. I wrote the gifts my friends wanted. No gifts for yourself? That Baby Jesus is very important to Dad. I have 5,50 euros. How? For being a messenger between the grandparents. Good work, Paulita. From caroling, we have sixty two euros. Rocio, you sing worse than we thought. So, how much do we have total? 107,50. We still need 242,50 euros to be able to buy the Baby Jesus. Why don't we hold a raffle? It's very typical at Christmas. The winner could be the the last three numbers of the lottery winner. - What can we raffle? - A gift basket. Where would we get the basket? No one ever picks it up They buy tickets from kids a little out of pity. Okay Eight. You know the trap, right? Sure Dad. I do. But I just don't see it. You think this'll seduce her? This's gonna turn trappin' on its head. It's completely new. You just have to do what I say. Vocalize like your mouth is full of dry cookies. Hey, Paco. Music. I know a little beatbox To accompany him, I mean. Paco, Paco, Paco. Paco. No worries. Let it go. The music. - Let's get started. - Telephone. Music. Action! Hey, you're so fit. Your beauty won't quit. That body ain't mine. It's like a shrine. Ain't gonna touch it. 'Til we tie the knot girl you gotta know it. It's your love, I deserve 'cause I respect and preserve. To love I vowed, and of you I'm proud. Come back to me Sara. I'm beggin' to start again. No fear, no doubts and no jealousy. Above all no gropin'. Oh my God. I can't believe it. - Unreal. - Cool, eh? Gotta keep on fixing things. Rocio, the audition is at five. If I don't get the role, remember what you promised. I'd change schools and sing the lottery. You promised what? - They're going to give it to you. - They better. After having made her the new costume. Hello, Dad. That face. How about a little joy? I'm just a nobody. You want me to write you a trap to get your wife back? I'm on fire. Well we're here. About time. The jury's waiting. - Hi, Javier. - Hello, Javier. Just a minute. This is the jury of independent moms? Yes. They're all your friends. And yours, Javier. You used to be one of us, remember? Well let's get started. Fernandito, on stage. First Cloe will audition. Scene the search for shelter. Let's go. Action. Sorry, at the inn there's no space. Go look for another place. Joseph, oh dear. I'm tired, I fear. If shelter we can't find, where will I have our child? Worry not, Mary mild. Soon shelter we will find. A manger, the farmer is kind. Will it do? Fine, Joseph, as long as it's with you. Bravo, very good! Bravo! Now you, Rocío. Come on, good luck. It's break a leg. Action. Sorry, at the inn there's no space. Go and look for another place. Oh, Joe. I'm so tired. What do you mean, Joe? Why so casual? It's Joseph, no nicknames, dearie. Go on. If shelter we can't find, where will I have our child? Please! So affected! Of course she's affected. It's a desperate moment. Don't worry, Mary, hon. We'll find something before we're done. Sure we will. If you say so. What is she saying? We took the liberty of changing the dialogue to give it realism. Like a real couple. Look, there's a manger. If that's alright with you. We'll see if there's any danger Then we'll make do. "Then we'll make do?". That's the rhyme you thought of? Ever hear of trappin' Leticia? Get with it. That's how youth talks today. The text has to be fresher to talk to the new generation. Enough is enough. The jury can deliberate. We appreciate the effort, Javier. But she's really bad. But she'll do great as shepherd three. Well if she's not going to have top billing I'm taking my kids and you have half the players. Fine. My kid will make a lovely angel. And we've got little sheep coming out of our ears. One good thing about confinement is the birth rate boom. Hey, excuse me. I'm not one to coerce the jury... But if Rocio isn't the star, I'm not St. Joseph. I guess there's a slot for the other starring role then. Do you want to be St. Joseph? Sure! Then the matter's closed. Thank you. Fernandito. You're the Nativity crapper. Thank you. This'll surely soften Carlota's heart. You think? Of course. You were the perfect gentleman. - Give me your - Hand? No, your beard. Hello. Home already? For your dad's sake I hope you got the part. Yes, Mom! I'm going to be St. Joseph! What? The jury was fixed. No worries, though. I got the beard. All we need is the rest. I'm not sewing. I'll adapt her Virgin costume and that's it! Poor Eight. Everyone's trashing him online. You still care. Yes, I can see that now, yeah. I tried make you happy with a more mature guy like Bambini. Sorry, but I'm taking back Eight. I don't care what you think. Sweetie, I can't meddle in your happiness. I hope not. Yes! I told my dad I took you back and he's fine with it. Great work, Bae. I even felt sometimes, like it was over. Told you it'd work. My dad was so scared of Big Bambini, he'll love you now. Thanks, Big. We appreciate it. A pleasure to help fans defend their love. Besides, the fire extinguisher vid has more than a million views. My song's on it. It's a win-win. And remember. Say no to drugs and yes to hugs. - Thank you. - Take care. Great guy. Hey, I feel guilty about fooling your dad into thinking we broke up. It was a favor. Things are back to normal now. Only now he's happy, instead of mad. Hey, you again? Scat, scat! Relax, I'm not going to sing... If you buy a raffle ticket from me you can win a gift basket with a turkey and a ham in it. What else can you win? All kinds of Christmas sweets, seafood, a bunch of stuff. How much? Only fifty cents. Okay then. Give me two. The winning number coincides with the last three in the National Lottery. Good luck. After all these raffle tickets, we still need 150 euros. How'd we do? We sold nearly all the tickets, but we still need more. I told Eight and he wants to help. Fifty euros. Tips from the pizzas. Fifty euros? I want to deliver pizzas when I'm big. And dad said he wasn't a good provider. We're still missing a hundred euros and we have 3 days. What can we do? Fernandito. Why are you here? To see Carlota. She's here. Wait. I'll go get her. Good afternoon, Mr. Agustin. You look a little down, if you don't mind me saying. You're right, Fernandito. Romantic problems? I was told your wife left you. Trust me. I also have an unrequited love. And I know how it hurts. I'm actually not worried about that. It's because I hurt a nice lady's feelings. And you like her? I think I do. Then don't give up. I never do. That's why I'm here. I brought her flowers, and gave up a role of a lifetime and this is my third try. Come with me, Fernando. Dang, and here comes the pain on top of everything. Good afternoon. Fernandito, what? We're really busy. I know. But maybe I'm the solution to your problems. Rocio tells me you need liquidity. This pig holds my savings. What better way to help my love. No, Fernandito. We can't take that, it's yours. Of course we can! Bring it here. Enough? I think we only need 15 more euros. No prob. I'll get it. Really? We'll call the seller then. Thanks, Fernandito. That's the nicest thing anyone's done for me. She embraced me. She's starting to love me. Not likely, kid! DECEMBER 22ND TWO DAYS UNTIL CHRISTMAS EVE Quiet. Rosaura's listening to the lottery. She's about to win. Laugh, but if I win, I'm on a plane to Punta Cana. You'll won't see me again for a while. I told you. I should be singing this. But if you had, you'd have been hoarse for the play this evening. That's fine to play St. Joseph. Dad. Can I? No, it's the last one and we should give it to our guest to celebrate he's back in the family. Dang! Thanks, Dad! I'm just gonna get some of my lactose-free milk. Very well. Hey. That smell? What's that stink? Was that you, Cris? Didn't we decide not to use a diaper? I'll take care of it. Rocio, watch the numbers for me. Your number was called! You won! Rosaura, come here. I'm serious! - Really? - Fourth prize. I'm so excited! Where's the ticket? I left it there. If you left it there, it should be there. Unless... What? Oh my God! Jose Luis. Jose Luis! Jose Luis! Jose Luis! Jose Luis! The dog ate it? I'm sorry, Rosaura. Come on, kids. Finish dressing. We're gonna be late again to the play. I can't be late, I'm the star! Dad, Dad. Where's the myrrh? I'm Melchor. I have to have myrrh. I don't know, son. Put in whatever. No one will know. Who's that? You get it, Rocio. You're ready. Hey, your crown? I've come for the basket that I won. Listen. Hey! Let's see. Here now! Open up! Hey, kid! I won! Oh, no! You must have the wrong house. You yourself sold me the ticket. Just a moment. A lady's here who says she won the basket. Can't say how she recognized me. Now what? Paula distract Mom and Dad. Dani, you distract the grandparents. Rocio, come with me. Jose Luis, Jose Luis! Jose Luis! Jose Luis, come here. Come on, Jose Luis! I'm ready! Great, honey. 'Cause we're running late. I dressed Cris as a lamb. Weren't you in charge of Cris's costume? Me? Wasn't it you? What did you do? Dad told me to stick on cotton balls with glue. Oh Lord! I was kidding. Did you put glue on her? We were out. We used it up to glue the... Other thing. So then, how did you glue it on? With honey. With honey. To the shower with Cris. Or we can take her like that. She's so sweet. No time for joking right now. Nor for cleaning up, either. We'll arrive after the baby's born. As far as I know St. Joseph missed the conception, but never the birth. Shower! Come on! - No shower! - No, time! Here lady. Here's your prize. - Congratulations. - Yes, yes, wow. Very good, thanks. Yes, yes. The way it should be responsible young ladies. We raised money so Dad wouldn't kill us. Now it's Mom who's gonna kill us. Innkeeper in place, quiet little sheep here. Very good. Hello! The stars of the show are here! What's this? She looks like a sheep with mange. Gross She's sticky. You're right. Here. Please, Gabriela. Put her in the herd, where you can't see her. Well break a leg, then. Right? Kids, don't eat the straw, that's all we have. I dropped off the artists. Carmen and Paco, are they not coming? They had the 7 month ultrasound today. And your Mother? My mother? - Look, here she is. - I'm here. Oh good, it hasn't started yet. Hello, Milagros. How's it going? Javier, tell your father-in-law not to speak to me. Mom, you look like a child. I know. Everyone says so. It's expensive to look good. Kids, everyone in place. Paulita, you need to get up there. Got the stardust? Remember to sprinkle it right when the baby's born. For five euros each, I'll throw this instead of stardust. They're exploding stink bombs. - Cool - Way Cool! Let's get started. Come on! Music. Curtain. Shh, quiet. It's starting. There isn't any space go find another place. Joseph, oh dear. I'm tired, I fear. If shelter we can't find, where will we have our child? Don't worry Mary, hon. We'll find something... What the heck? Before we're done. Look there's a manger. If it's alright with you. When that kid gets something in her head. I wonder who she takes after? So that was the shelter we had that night. And before this story is over... Eight, babe! - Dad. - What? Is it almost over? Jesus was just born. Now the angel appears. It's Paulita. From angel dust... The child is born! The child is born! It smells awful. Paulita, no! It wasn't me, it wasn't me. I was just striking the pose I was told to. Paula! Paula! Don't get up. There's still the grand finale. And they lived happily ever after. DECEMBER 23RD. 1 DAY BEFORE CHRISTMAS EVE You really did a number yesterday. I don't know if the Wise Men will be visiting this year. Dad said It didn't matter if I didn't have myrrh. Not you honey. Rosaura, we have to get the turkey out. Please. I took it out yesterday. It's in the fridge. Ma'am, it's not here! It's not there? I'll look in the freezer. How could a turkey disappear from the freezer? Ma'am, the candy is gone and the champagne and the new year's grapes. What? It wasn't us. Oh Lord. What's going on here? We can explain. Go right ahead. We sold raffle tickets. But we didn't have a gift basket. - What? - We didn't expect they'd come for it. People never do. We put one together, using things from home. Why did you have a raffle? To buy a new Baby Jesus. Oh Lord. Why? 'Cause the old one threw itself off the top of the cupboard when I tried to get it. - What? - Mom, relax. We were able to get the money together for a new one. We're meeting the vendor this afternoon. Oh, that's the good thing. And Mom, now you can't tell on us, 'cause you're an accomplice. That doesn't work with Mom, dummy. The mess you got yourselves into. And you were going to meet up with a stranger? No, he was bringing it here or by delivery, right? Please. Mom, don't tell Dad. Oh no, of course not. How do I explain that I have to buy pizza for Christmas since you raided our supplies? We could say the turkey burned. Or that we've all become vegan. Looks like it's here. Excuse me. Yes? We came for the Baby Jesus. What Baby Jesus? I spoke to you on the phone. Oh yes, yes. That's right. Let's see. Here it is. But that's not it. It isn't? Oh, yeah, but it's similar, no? That one's smaller. We want the one in the photo. I see. Correct. But I sold that one to a man a couple of hours ago. What? He paid me double for it. How could you do this to kids? Ma'am, this isn't a Christmas movie, it's a business. Unreal. - Come on kids, let's go. - Yeah, scat, go on. I won't charge you for today's lesson. That's life. What a bad man! Teach some manners to that brat. She came up short. Come on, kids. Relax. maybe Dad won't notice the other one's broken. - Come on, guys. - It's not fair. 24TH OF DECEMBER. CHRISTMAS EVE Well, well, well. When the family gets here, we can place the Baby Jesus in his manger. They're here. I'll get it. Say your prayers. The pizzas. Come in. Welcome. I brought some lentil soup leftovers from last night as an appetizer. Hello, Milagros. Aunt Carmen! You're like the Virgin and St. Joseph. I hope she goes into labor before Dad gets it out. What, Carlota? Nothing, nothing. Well dear family, since we're all here the moment's here to put out the Baby Jesus. Dear, are you okay? It's in a million pieces. Don't worry, Dad. We can glue it back. My Lord. Serves me right not letting you near it. Don't say that Dad. It's not your fault you're such a klutz. Look at the bright side. Now you will let us touch it. 'Cause we can't break it again. We could each put a piece of him in the manger. That's a pretty good idea. Oh, yeah. Let's go. There. Good. How cute! Dinner! Come on, Uncle Paco's. Pizzas will get cold. Come on! Pizza, pizza! - And my lentils. - Let's go! That was a great performance. It really looked like you fell. I actually hurt myself a little But poor kids. It's the least I could do after all that you told me. Milagros. Can we talk? What do you want? I was very rude the other day. You were. But don't worry, I'll let it go. I can't let it go. Because I can't stop thinking of you. And I'm tired of not fighting for what I want. Wait! Gross! Does this mean Mom and Dad are going to be siblings? Oh my! It's fine. Love as a senior citizen is beautiful. And with a little luck, she'll leave. That's not it! Auntie Carmen! Auntie Carmen! Dad, Mom! What is it now? I hope nothing else is broken. Auntie Carmen broke her water! 12 DAYS LATER The Wise Men came! The Wise men came! What time is it? What time is it? It's very early. It's too early. Wow! The Wise Men are so good. - Yes! - They came! Are you happy, Dani? Yes. Your friends' gifts? Yup. Thank goodness. Well I got this one for you. Just what I wanted! And this. Thank you! And this. Oh, wow! And this. Cool! You too, Cris? Thank you. We also changed our lists. We all asked for one for you instead of for us so you'd get gifts, too. Really? You guys are much better than imaginary siblings. Rosaura, I also have a gift for you. - Oh yes? - Yes. It's the money you won in the lottery. I couldn't let you not get that prize money. 'Cause Jose Luis ate your ticket. I can't. Yes, you have to take it. It's Christmas, please. I mean I can't believe you're such a louse. You hid my ticket, right? How could you think that, you don't seem to know me. But I do know you. Rosaura, you threatened to leave us on Christmas Eve. 'Til after the holidays. We couldn't have survived without you. Try to understand. I did it for my own good. - Hey Dad, dad. - What is it? The Wise Men didn't leave me anything. Sucker! It's Christmas in July. But it could be April, for all it matters. With the warmth of your family that's near, Christmas comes from within. Sometimes the morning breaks, full of garlands and smiles. Sometimes an inch of joy, will last for miles. Sometimes a cloud of frost traps you and fools you. Leaves you warm and happy and you're wrapped inside and out by a ray of sunshine. Yes, I'm lucky to have you. When the day begins and you say "I love you". Loving you so much that the universe shakes. I can fly and disappear, I can enter your dreams, it's as easy as pie. Abracadabra, now you see me now you don't. Today I want to be a genie without a lamp. 20 times stronger than you and faster, too. My mood's always light. It's noon on the moon. It's the season of salt in the sea. It's better than before a great time to start for you and me. It's Christmas in July. But it could be April, for all it matters. With the warmth of your family that's near, Christmas comes from within. FATHER THERE IS ONLY ONE 4 IN THE... FAR HORIZON
