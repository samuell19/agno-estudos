What'll it be? Er, do you know the whereabouts of a young lady by the name of Mary Roberts? BARTENDER: Sure. She's around here someplace. Oh, er... I'm Miss Roberts' guardian. What do you want to see her for? Why, we have some very important news for her. Oh. What's it about? Well, I'm sorry, sir, but we're not supposed to discuss that with anyone but her. Yeah, you see, it's private. Her father died and left her a gold mine and we're not supposed to tell anybody but her. See. Didn't we, Ollie? - A gold mine? - It's the biggest thing in the... Now that he's taken you into our confidence, you might as well know the rest. Shh. (SOFTLY) We've got the deed to the property and we're supposed to give it to her in person... What? I said we've got the deed to the property... Say, you better show it to him, maybe he doesn't believe us. It's the truth. Say, did I give you the deed? Oh, I know where it is. Excuse me. See? Mary Roberts. Come here. - Have you ever seen this Mary Roberts? - Uh-uh. Good. Well, I'll go and find her for you, but don't tell a soul about it till I get back. - We won't. - Thank you. A good thing we found her. Lola! Lola, we've got a fortune right in the palm of our hand. What do you mean? There's a couple of desert rats downstairs looking for Mary Roberts. What about it? They've got a deed to a very valuable gold mine, left to her by her father, and they're here to deliver it to her in person. Well, ain't that just grand. It would be if you were Mary Roberts. I got you, but I'd never get away with it. Sure you would. They've never seen Mary Roberts. Then it's a cinch! (WINCES) (WINCES) Put that shoe on properly. - What's the matter with it? - I can't eat that meat! That's as tough as shoe leather! - Think you can do it? - Can I do it? For a gold mine, I could be Cleopatra. That's the girl! - Bring 'em up. - I will. Oh! Hey! If you come upstairs, I'll introduce you to Mary Roberts. - Right away, sir. - Did you call me, Mr Finn? Ooh! No... Get back into the kitchen where you belong. Go ahead now! This way, gentlemen. Come right this way. This way, gentlemen. Just sit yourselves down and I'll go and get Lola... I mean Mary, for you. I've already told her the news and she's terribly shocked. - Lola! They're here. - That's swell, kiddo. Put these in your arms. Mary, these are the gentlemen I was telling you about. Tell me... Tell me about my dear, dear daddy. Is it true that he's dead? Well, we hope he is, they buried him. Oh, it can't be. What did he die of? I think he died of a Tuesday. Or was it Wednesday? Do you... I'll handle this delicate situation. Little lady, you've heard the worst... Now prepare yourself for the best. Now, cheer up. Smile. That's right. Remember, every cloud has a silver lining. That's right. Any bird can build a nest, but it isn't everyone that can lay an egg, is it, Ollie? That's right. (EXHALES) Do you realise that you own one of the richest gold mines in the world? LOLA; Oh. Your father left you the whole property. And he gave me the honour of presenting you with the deed. - Oh, isn't it wonderful, Uncle Finn? - Yes, my dear. - Who's there? - Mary. - Mary who'? - Mary... Mary Christmas. Excuse me, Mr Finn, one of these gentleman dropped this at the foot of the stairs. Ooh! Thank you, little lady. You don't know what you've done! Thanks. All right, all right, all right. There you are, signed, sealed and now... Delivered. Oh. Thank you so much. Not at all. (SIGHS) - Come, Stanley, we'd better be going. - Yeah. - Oh! Say, what about the locket? - That's right! - We've got something else for you. - I almost forgot it. And besides that, your father left you this family heirloom. Oh, yes. I remember it well. Help me get it off, Stan. Am I hurting you? No. Just a minute. - Won't be long. - Yeah. Maybe I'd better try and open it again. I think so. (GRUNTS SOFTLY) lt slipped. Maybe you better take your coat off. Pardon me just a minute. We'll find it in just a moment. We got it. I'll go in and change. Pardon us. - Say, Ollie? - What? Now that you got your clothes off why don't you take a bath? Would you mind leaving the room? Can't I ever have a little privacy? I was just trying to kill two birds with one stone. And I'll take care of those two bozos and get them out of town. Don't worry, leave everything to me. I've done pretty good up to now, haven't I? You certainly have. I wish you were in my shoes... (CLEARS THROAT) Oh, how about a drink on the house? That suits me fine. - How'd you get dressed so quick? - None of your business. Goodbye, Miss Roberts, and thanks for the use of your boudoir. - You're very welcome. - Goodbye. Now that you've got the mine I bet you'll be a swell gold-digger. - What's your evil plan? - I'll send her right up. You have her sign that deed over to us. Oh, don't worry about me, get those guys out of town, and pronto! All right. What a cinch.

Goodbye, Mr Finn. - Goodbye. - Goodbye, mister. - Goodbye, sir. - Goodbye. - Have a good time. Goodbye, Miss, er... Miss, er... Roberts. Mary Roberts. - Goodbye, Miss Roberts. - Goodbye. Did you hear what she said her name was? Sure, Mary Roberts. How can she be Mary Roberts when we've just given the deed to Mary Roberts? I don't know. - I smell a rat. -(SIZZLING) I smell something, too. Come on. Pardon me. Did you ever have a father by the name of Cy Roberts? Why,yes! He left me here with these people years ago when he went prospecting. - Well, who's that woman upstairs? - That's Lola Marcel, Mr Finn's wife. She's my legal guardian now. Can I speak to you for a minute? - Pardon us. - Yeah, we'll be right back. - You know what? - What? I think we've given that deed to the wrong woman. It's the first mistake we've made since that guy sold us the Brooklyn Bridge. Oh, buying that bridge was no mistake. That's gonna be worth a lot of money to us someday. Maybe you're right. We'd better go and get the deed. Say, maybe they won't give it back to us. What do you mean they won't give it back to us? We'll get that deed or I'll eat your hat. That's what I call determination. Come on. Splendid, splendid! (LAUGHING) She fell for it like you fell for me. (CHUCKLES) Lola my girl, we're sitting pretty. - Who's there? - Me. - Me who? -"Me who"! What do you want? Out of my way, you snake in the grass. You toad-in-the-hole. Say, you slugs, what do you mean busting in here like this? We want to know why you are not Mary Roberts. I'll take care of this matter. So you got wise, huh? Well, if it's this deed you're after, you're just out of luck. - Give that back to me! - Take it, Stan! Beat it! (ALL CLAMOURING) (OLLIE YELLING) Ahhh! Oh! (BLOWING) Oh! That's it, Stan! Take it. Take it, Stan! Go on, Stanley! Go on! Get it, Stan! Give me that deed. Get away. Get away! Why don't you... (LOLA EXCLAIMS) Give me that! Oh! Open it! Stan!

And you're just the man I'm looking for. Oh, thank you. This man... Oh! (CONTINUES LAUGHING) I thought I told you two dudes to catch the next coach out of town. Yes, sir. Well, it left ten minutes ago. It did? Maybe we'd better try and catch it. I'll say you'd better try and catch it! (GUNSHOTS) Look at them go! Ha! You can't see 'em for dust. (SHERIFF AND FINN LAUGHING) - Say, Ollie. - What? You don't think we're taking any chance going back there tonight and robbing that safe, do you? Chance or no chance, we've got to get that deed back. And just as soon as my clothes are dry, that's exactly what we're going to do. I think that's a good idea. You know, if that girl ever found out... Give me a light! Those matches are soaking wet. Thank you. See if my clothes are dry. Your hat's dry. That reminds me. You made a statement this afternoon. - Did I? - Mmm-hmm. You said that if we didn't get the deed that you'd eat my hat. Oh, now you're taking me literally. Nevertheless, I'm going to teach you not to make rash promises. Eat the hat. Oh, that's silly. Who ever heard of anybody eating a hat? Who ever heard of anybody doing that? - Eat the hat. - I won't do it. If you don't eat that hat, I'll tie you to a tree and let the buzzards get you. - Would you really do that? - I certainly would.

If it's anything like the last one, yes. What is it? How about me pulling you up on the block and tackle?
