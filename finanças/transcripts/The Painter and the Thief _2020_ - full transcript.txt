[clattering] [calm music] [calm music continues] [indistinct chatter] [chattering continues] [laughing] Whoo! [woman 1] Congratulations. [calm music] [ominous music] [calm music continues] [in Norwegian] [reporter 1] [speaking Norwegian] [reporter 1] [woman 1 in English] We have identified the thieves. -So the painting is... Mm-hm. -Unfortunately, we have not found the paintings. Um, the investigation is now closed. [chuckles] [groans] I don't know what to think. [oöystein mumbling] Did you have dinner? [Barbora] No, I did not have any dinner. Well, I can buy something. Okay, baby. I love you and thank you! Bye! -Hi. -Hi. [Barbora] So, they just leave it somewhere leaning, I don't know, somewhere leaning against the wall or somewhere by a garbage place? And five minutes later, there comes a car with a garbage man and they take it all. And that's gone! It's unbelievable. I think they are even hanging on the wall. And I think, uh, yeah... -I think they're... -So you think that this person has some, like, secret room in the basement? Yeah. With, like, arm chair. Big arm chair... -Yeah, yeah. -and these two paintings. -Yeah. -Really? I don't see them here, actually. -It's very... -I don't see the painting. -They're behind the red pipes. -Mm-hm. That's, like, of course, funny placement. [Barbora] Uh-huh. They even tied it with a rope. Tape and rope are on the canvases. Thanks to this footage the guys were identified. -Both of the thieves. -oöystein] Mm-hm. [Barbora] But what I understood, the trial will be with, uh... the one who is supposed to be in-charge of the robbery. [oöystein] Do you know something about him or... [Barbora] Only that he's Norwegian. [oöystein] Okay. [indistinct chatter] [Barbora] [woman 1] [Barbora] [Barbora sighs] [footsteps] [Barbora] [thief 1] [Barbora] -[thief 1] -[Barbora laughs] [Barbora] [thief 1] [Barbora] -[Barbora] -[thief 1] [Barbora] [thief 1] [Barbora] -[Barbora] -[thief 1] [Barbora] He has been imprisoned for eight years. [oöystein] Yeah. That's a lot of tattoos. Oh, what's this written on his chest? Hmm. -That' really... -Something about snitchers. "Snitchers are a... dying breed." [Barbora] I might just never find out where the paintings are. I actually think that I wouldn't presume too much. [Barbora] Right. [sighs] [sniffs] [Barbora] I think I will be asking you regularly to just sit here. I really like to draw this way, I'm realizing. And I remember you said at the court room. That you will do whatever, uh... Not whatever I want but however you can help me with my art. So, actually, you will be my model for free. You will just sit here for hours and hours. It's okay, I can sit. [chuckles] [sighs] [Barbora] I wonder, do you remember every crime you make? A robbery or... Except of the one that forgotten about. -'cause you don't remember? -No. -No. -[Barbora] No? So you don't have some sort of like a... -Yeah. -...diary of... -No, police have them. -[Barbora chuckles] -Police has it. True. Of course. -Hm. Now, you don't need to know them. -[Bertil laughs] -That I mean... I can tell you some more about how I got... got... got like to be a criminal, got, like, to be a drug addict. -[Barbora] Hm. -Mm-hm. When I was 18, we were 13 friends from the same... same environment. Now, we're only two left. What happened to the others? Some were killed, some killed themselves, some OD'd, some, you know... So... then I got into much harder kind of guy. -Hm. -[sighs] -And, um... -So became a gangster, sort of? -Yes. -Mm-hm. [Bertil] And we started pushing drugs, using drugs. Potting from Wednesday to Wednesday. Better than from Monday to Monday. Yeah, it is, it is. Much better start on Wednesday. And, uh... -I love your humor. -[laughs] I really do. And then I got my first... my first time in jail. -And, uh... -How was it? -Oh... I loved it. Yeah. -The first time... [tranquil music] [tranquil music continues] [indistinct chatter] I'm just a curious person and I just so much wish that you bring me to this day. And you tell me all that you remember. And, just, as a person, I'm curious as me, as Barbora. I have told you everything I remember. I was so wasted. And that's the truth. -That is... No. -Come on. -That is... -I'm sure you remember. No. That is the truth. Everything I remember was told in court. And you were saying something that you actually have been... -Yeah. -...passing by these paintings -several times. -But never... never planning anything about it. But do you remember how... what... what made you to actually do it then at this one day? I didn't know when I got in the back door. I didn't know that I was in that location where these pictures that I have seen before was. I absolutely believe what you're saying, okay? I don't have reason to not to believe you. It's I just want to understand this very moment, you know, how it was. How can you understand a junkie that's been awake for four days and has used, uh... -20 grams of amphetamine -Well, I'm learning to... and eating hundred, uh, hundred pills? [Bertil] But that wasn't me. I hope it was. [laughs] Yeah, but it wasn't me. -You know what I mean. -Oh, I understand what you mean. [keys jingling] So, um, I hope you don't get lost on the way and see you here in 20 minutes. [door opens] -Hi. -Hi. Ooh. It's not my fault I'm lost. [Barbora] Yeah, yeah. It's just started. Of course, a lot of works still, but, uh... -Fuck me over! -It's just started. -What the fuck? -[Barbora laughs] You did that out of... I... [Bertil] You did this from... No. Whoa. [heavy breathing] [sighs sharply] [Bertil whimpering] [crying] -Come on! -No, no, no. Oh, don't do that to me. [cries] [Barbora] I truly did not mean to make you cry, Bertil. I don't know if I should take this as a compliment. [crying] [sobbing] [gasping] [sobbing] Come... [shushes] [sobs softly] -[Bertil] Welcome... -Thank you. ...to my dungeon. Cozy. Cute place. Congrats, Bertil and Villa. And, of course, I'll always feel very good at places where, you know, the walls are covered by things in frames -and all that. -[Bertil laughs] So that, you know, I can stand this kind of... -... like minimal design. -Neat walls? [Barbora] Minimalistic design thing. This is... This is what makes home. [Bertil] We don't have any... uncovered walls. -[Barbora] Is it original? -[Bertil] Yes. -Oh, that's a graphic, isn't it? -I love this picture. -[Bertil] It's a... -Vebjoørn Sand! Oh, god. Yeah. Okay. [chuckles] [Bertil laughs] [Barbora] This might be an original graphic, actually. Whoa. I mean, if it's original, then it's a... This is original. Damn it. -[Bertil] It should be. -[Barbora] It is. [Bertil] It should be original. [Barbora] No, this is a total great piece. Absolutely. [Bertil] You know, these shoes... [Barbora] These were your first shoes. [Bertil] Yeah, it was. -[chuckles] -Hm? -Is that true? -Yeah, that's... [Bertil laughs] It's a good souvenir to keep from childhood. I wrote you a letter. And I want you to read it now. [Barbora] From you to me? [Bertil] From me to you. Are you sure that I shall open it now? Mm-hm. [Bertil chuckles] Okay. You should read it loud. But then, I feel like, uh, somebody is stealing it from me. [Bertil] No. [Barbora clears throat] "I've thought for a long time to write you some words. And now, I finally found a pen. You inspire me and teach me so much that I've missed in my sometimes dysfunctional life. If you only knew. I'm so proud of being painted on a piece of canvass. You teach me art in a way that... that's new for me. Art isn't just a painting but so much more. All the feelings, tears... Nobody has ever seen me vulnerable like you. True, pure friendship. You are an amazing person, Barbora. There's so much more I should have written, but now, I'm out of paper for tonight. So, next time. Yours truly, Karl-Bertil." [Bertil sighs] Thank you, Karl-Bertil. [light music] [Barbora] I have been finding myself quite often thinking about him while painting him. I wonder if he has ever been to Berlin 'cause I don't think that he has... ever really had like... proper vacation or sort of... kind of, you know, touristic traveling. He truly hates pickles in burgers and pineapple on pizza. And he very much loves old, Norwegian, wooden churches. Bertil's favorite film is Dugma, and especially the scene where the suicide bomber is eating chicken like as if nothing happens. Personally, I truly believe that in the several different settings, Bertil could be one of those. At the same time, I truly believe in another different setting. Bertil could as well be a prime minister of Norway. Bertil has been to many accidents and many... often quite self-destructive situations. It feels like that this is his way how he shouts for attention. To be seen. [ominous music] Bertil grew up in a farm with his parents and two siblings. When Bertil was eight years old, his parents took a divorce and the mother took his siblings and moved away. From then on, Bertil had no contact with them. Living with his father only. The father worked day and night. He was gone all the time. There must be a very long list of trauma past that this guy is carrying inside of him. Bertil got really very good marks at school. He was one of the brightest students, it seems. He used to work with kids with special needs, like ADHD or Asperger's or... He helped a lot to these kids to reach grades at schools. These kids that nobody else believed that they would really make it. I have been thinking about new painting for some time now. Um, that shall be a painting of Bertil and his girlfriend. Can you make... Is it possible that you... Yeah, so that we get more light on your face. [Barbora] That's, yeah, very good. Yeah, that's good. Wow. Very nice. Look elsewhere. Yeah. -[shutter clicking] -Super good. Very good. [Barbora] Maybe we can make this a little higher so that they'll see your message. [Bertil groans] And your fingers show "AMOR" so it's clear that you love him, don't worry. [Bertil chuckles] [dramatic music] [dramatic music continues] [knocks on door] [Bertil] Hi, Barbora. Good evening, star shine. [Bertil speaks Norwegian] [in English] I feel like shit. I'm sorry, I really... guys, I don't know what to say. I just don't feel like saying anything. Just to be here with you for this moment, it's great. [Barbora] Sometimes, I can absolutely not understand what's happening with Bertil. What worries me a lot is that it's also happening quite often that, uh... he can't be reached for a very long period of time. [operator speaking Norwegian] [in English] I'm fucking fed up with this voicemail. Come on, Bertil. [groans] I got a message that says... [sniffs] "Karl-Bertil stole my car tonight when we slept. Cops came after him then he tried to drive from them." And here... She also sent me two articles. [reporter in Norwegian] [indistinct chatter] [EKG monitor beeping] [unsettling music] [unsettling music continues] [Bertil speaking Norwegian] [Bertil] [heavy metal music playing] [sizzling] [smooches] [Bertil] [Barbora in English] I really like to draw this way, I'm realizing. So, actually, you will be my model for free. You will just sit here for hours and hours. [Bertil in Norwegian] Hm. [in English] And I also like this skull. This one is very charming. [Bertil in Norwegian] [in English] Like it was a real skull with such carvings. -Ooh. -[Bertil laughing] Yeah. [Bertil in Norwegian] [inaudible] [Bertil] [dramatic music] [Bertil] [in English] I have told you everything I remember. I was so wasted. And that's the truth. [overlapping dialogue] [Bertil in Norwegian] [in English] Do you know anything -about like -[Bertil] I have no... -black market with arts? -No. -Do you know anybody who... -No. And I don't mean, like, that you would snitch, no. -Not at all. -No, no, no. I don't know anything about... [Bertil chuckles] I don't know nothing... So you don't even know what you're planning, what were you thinking to do with the paintings? No, you asked me that a thousand times -and I still don't know. -[Barbora] I did not ask you a thousand times. Screw you. I only asked you twice because I was so afraid to ask you. I was afraid to have to hurt you, okay? I have no idea, it was just... [Bertil in Norwegian] [dramatic music] [Bertil in Norwegian] -[receptionist] Hi. -Hi. Yeah. [receptionist] [Bertil] Hm. [receptionist speaking Norwegian] [Bertil's girlfriend] [sniffs] [train horn honking] [clattering] [indistinct chatter] -[dealer] -[Bertil] [Bertil] -[dealer] -[Bertil] [dealer] [Bertil's girlfriend] Huh? Hmm... [Bertil] -[Bertil] -[Bertil's girlfriend] [crying] [Bertil's girlfriend] [Bertil gasps] [knocks on door] [Bertil] Hi, Barbora. Good evening, star shine. [Bertil in Norwegian] [Bertil in English] I feel like shit, -Now, sit down. -Hm. [Bertil] She's pushing me. Controlling me. [Bertil muttering] [in Norwegian] [breathes heavily] [line ringing] -[Barbora] Señor? -Hello, my dear. [indistinct] I'm moving out to the forest for a couple of... [Barbora stuttering] And what... Why are you moving? They love arguing with me early in the morning so I... told her to fuck off and I got out of there and didn't come back in... since she was at work and now she's coming back home. So I'm just packing the most necessary things -and leaving for the forest. -Wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait, my dear. Come on, I mean, okay, it's a drama. It's a very big drama but... She has packed all off my stuff while I was away. -She packed your things? -Yes, all of my shit. Even my socks. -Socks? -Yeah. Fuck her. Maybe it's for the best of the both of you. I assume that you guys maybe have a small break from each other and should... [stammering] No, I have arranged to borrow... a very fast motorcycle. So I'm taking out and I'm on the highway tonight. Uh, yeah, well, that sounds, uh, like such a very strange idea. -Not strange. -Why does... Why is it that you like to drive a very fast motor? [stuttering] No. Don't even try. Don't even try, Barbora, I'm serious. I'm gonna have this couple of kilometers of trail today. Okay, just don't kill yourself, darling, that's what I'm saying. -No, I will not. -We need you alive. I never kill myself on cycle, I kill myself on cars. [chuckles] You're so typical, my dear. Okay, talk to you tomorrow. Yeah, will do that. Have a great evening! -You too. Ciao! -Ciao. Bye. [in Norwegian] [door slams] [flatlining] [ECG monitor beeps] [ominous music] [indistinct chatter] [sighs] [in Norwegian] [groans] [sighs] [moans] [groaning] [Bertil] [breathing heavily] [moans] [sighs] Close the eyes. Don't open until I say. [Barbora] There's a special therapy that you have for the time that you are in need of this medicine. -Hm. -You can open your eyes now. [giggles] Hmm. [Barbora] I think it's better than smart TV. [Bertil chuckles] -It's much better. -[Barbora chuckles] I was thinking that since... this is the time when your head might be spinning with thoughts and... maybe it's not the best time to look at yourself like that. It's a nice picture. -Isn't it? -Mm-hm. [chuckles] I'm thinking about this last year. It's been... fucking hard, right? [laughs] And now I have to go back to jail. -Yeah, most likely. -Most likely. [tranquil music playing] [keyboard clacking] [Bertil] Dear Barbora. I published a picture of my hips. I wrote, "Feels like I just got screwed or something. You know, hips don't lie." I don't like Shakira's music but I love the CD you gave me. I'm actually writing you to thank you. And I want you to know that I see what you're doing for me. I know you don't have much money almost nothing at all. I know you sometimes prioritize to buy me lunch and other things I need when you can't afford to buy your own lunch. Bertil's gonna be moved again at night to the jail. This is insane. [Bertil] When I don't get the best possible treatment, you are there to help me. You fight so that I shall get the best treatment so that I can be able to walk again. Thank you. Yours truly, The Bertilizer. Okay... [mumbles] [groaning] [sighs sharply] [in Norwegian] [groans] [chuckles] Yes! [laughing] Oh! [breathing heavily] [Barbora in English] But then, you also have some, like, special spikes for when it feels icy. I do. -I broke it now. -Yeah. -No? -Yeah. Hmm. Wait, wait, wait... Wait, wait, wait for me, please. [sighs sharply] Yeah? I'm waiting, I'm waiting, I'm waiting... Thank you. I'm waiting, -And I'm waiting... -So, my dear, Merry Christmas! [speaks Norwegian] -Fucking shitless. -To your health. -For your health. -Hm! Ooh, oh... -[sighs] -Shush. I will think you're the craziest person I've ever met. No. [chuckles] -That was your last cigarette. -I know. [judge in Norwegian] [ominous music] [judge in Norwegian] [overlapping dialogue] [Bertil] [officer] Barbora? [officer] [knocks on glass door] -[Bertil] -[female officer] -[female officer] -[Bertil] [indistinct chatter on TV] [ominous music] [Bertil in Norwegian] [in English] Trying to escape. [Bertil in Norwegian] [in English] It's like over hand coming in. [Barbora] Yes, I mean, I could also... [Bertil in Norwegian] Have to be careful... [Bertil in Norwegian] [ominous music] [somber music] [somber music continues] Come on, Bertil, just... [tuts] Oh... Look at you. Hm. You have to... Hm. [chuckles] [Barbora] Wow, this is something. You're standing. Yeah, just on one feet. Go. Go back. -[groans] -[sighs] [mumbles] You look great. Dear, boy. Compared to the last time. How are you? [sighs] I'm doing good. This is Jesus! -[Bertil] Oh, yes? -This is fucking Jesus' stigma. Any idea? So you're stigmatized. Want it or not. [both laugh] I have, uh, feelings now. -You do or you don't? -I do. But this is really gorgeous. I mean, you had big nail here from the Romans, you know. [Barbora stuttering] You have, like, in the bones. -You have like screws and... -Mm-hm. Titanium screws going... holding my hips together. But... Sorry but this is just so amazing. [Barbora] This is totally... -[Bertil] That's deep. -I have to take picture of this. -This is... -It's so deep. I don't face your face now. I just focus on your skin. [Barbora] Do I have to explain you that I love to draw and paint hands? If there's just few information you should have by now about me, then one of those should be that you know I'm obsessed with hands. Don't you know that? Yeah, I'm just... I'm just curious about the context. You find your friend, uh... destroyed by a car accident and what you focus is on the wound. [oöystein] Don't you feel like it's a bit uncomfortable to use that to create art? [Barbora] No, because he survived. Probably, if he's not a survivor, maybe I would have very different feeling. Maybe I would not make the drawing at all or the painting. Because he could not give me his agreement whether, uh, I could paint that or draw that. That would be different, but now that we know that he's out of that, so... I have absolutely no more problems towards anybody working with this motif. It's not a big problem but I just think it's interesting that you don't find it problematic at all in any way. [stuttering] Well, darling, don't... -It's like you don't... -No, you can't se... -wanna hear... -But, sweetheart, no, but you did not hear my answers. Like how can you say that I don't find it problematic at all? I never said that. Of course, I find it problematic. -Okay! -But still, of course, I go for it when I feel that the person that might be involved in it -can handle it. -Just, okay, You are working in the world and then you find some suffering uh, you think, "Whoa! That's beautiful! I wanna bring it into my studio." It's not a way of dealing with the world. It's not... It's... Isn't there a paradox here or some... -I don't know. It's just... -This suffering has to fulfill one basic rule for me. It has to be aesthetic. -Yeah, I know... -It has to have aesthetics. Happy guy! [chuckles] -[Barbora] Who is gonna hug me? -Yeah, but... -Yeah? -I'm handicapped. -[Bertil] Okay, fuck off. -oöystein] No, no. Be careful. Be careful. [both groaning] [Bertil groans] -You're such a... -[Bertil] I love you! -oöystein laughing] -[sighs] Then give me a favor and sit down, okay? -Okay. -Good. -Look at me now. -Go. [sighs sharply] [oöystein laughs] [Barbora] That's exactly what you should be doing -based on the papers -Yeah. -that we have read, you know. -Yes... Yesterday... Yesterday, it was four weeks ago, I broke my back three places, -my hip eight places. -Is it four weeks ago? Yes, yes, they was. And my... both shoulders, and my ribs, and now I'm here. -Fuck, please. Please. -[Barbora laughing] -Please. -And yesterday, I walked one kilometer with crutches. [oöystein] But it's nice to see you! You look surprisingly, uh, okay. -[Bertil] I am okay. -Yeah? [sniffs] I'm trying to understand whether you do understand the practical and emotional risk. Not until you ask me. -And so I'm trying to ask you -Okay. why don't you think so because it's so obvious for me that there is practical and emotional risk in getting involved with somebody that... so likely... can happen to not be able to take care of themself. Which means that you, as involved emotionally, existentially, is... in a relationship with somebody that doesn't take care of themselves, you will have to take care of it. And I... It's not... And I don't say that we should stop taking care of people when they need our help, that's not what I'm saying. So, it's not about what is the good moral thing to do here. I'm just... trying to understand how you can put yourself in that situation without, sort of... having like critical... How you'll grade yourself. That's what I'm trying to understand. I just haven't had such dialogue with the critical myself. Why? It did not happen. It hasn't happened. [sighs] I don't wanna sound sort of pathetic or theatrical but, really, the moment I have met him at the courtroom, I really, sort of, fell in love with him like there was no way how I could... how I could see the... the thief in this guy. Really, I just saw purely like naked soul standing there. -Don't... I don't have... -Wait. I'm just coming to... to... Okay? I did not plan to start a big friendship with this guy. But I, at the same time, did not plan anything at all. I just let it flow. For me, as a boyfriend, this is very important. Okay? This is very important. [stuttering] 'Cause it... This is... This is a possible attraction toward... something which is destructive. Which, of course, is relevant for me. That's the reason why I'm asking, you know. [loud whirring] Um, I guess it did not work, right? It's set. Can we try once more? [beeping] Uh, can we maybe even try it without, uh, grapes? Okay. There is, uh, actually, certain chance -that I... -Okay. -[humming] -[clanking] [Barbora] Shoot! [groans] [chuckles] Okay... [blows raspberries] One thousand two hundred twenty. Great. Where shall I find that? Seven thousand? For what? [clacking] [Barbora] What really occupies my life the most is the painting. When I close the door of the studio, I start to paint. And that's my... that's my universe. I need to paint every day. I really feel like I'm, um, the painting junkie, sort of. I know that I'm doing it on cost of oöystein. And that really doesn't... uh, do any good to our relationship. -[clacks] -Shit! [oöystein] One thing is her passion about painting and like I wanna create this, but when it turns unhealthy in the way that you could stand there and paint and the whole world falls apart around you. That's her mechanism that I find a bit scary. I mean, when she moves from Berlin, she moved for a man, that, you know, he was not just wanting to kill her, he wanted to kill me as well, you know. We fled Berlin, basically. From a really crazy man that she had broken off many years ago, but continue to be in a, sort of, relationship with just because it made her the space the she needed to paint. This is insane for me. It's like, how can you put yourself live in that situation? It's like letting your kid play in traffic. You don't do that, you know. I played in traffic in Prague. There was no other way. Yeah, but there's something there. What you're saying now, that is actually... -It's not just... -That is the most funny thing -to say. -Yeah, yeah, yeah. I agree. It's funny on the one level. But on one level, it's true. You know, some part of you... have the kid in you. And you just place this kid into the parking or the middle of the motor road and you just let her play there. And it's scary to see being a partner that, okay, so something of you, you really don't take care of. And you don't care. Hm. There's little kid inside of you you just don't pick up and take care of. That's the most scary part. I feel that my kid wants to paint. Hm. Thank you, Lord, for all the... treasures you're giving us. God bless. -[female curator] Hi. -Hi. Sorry, okay. Um, sorry for the late reply but, um... but we are a very commercial gallery so, um, so I don't think it's for us. And I think, um, we have already two exhibitions in October so, um, so it's no way we can do it, I'm sorry. Okay. [sighs sharply] No after no after no after no. Will anybody ever say yes to me? [phone beeps] [operator speaking Norwegian] [Dian in English] Barbora, it's Dian. Um, I sent you an email about two weeks ago because, uh, you know three payments are with you. And I have not heard anything from you. And please stay contact. [sniffs] [sighs sharply] [whimpers] So stupid. [sobbing] [oöystein] What? Something important? Just would like to discuss something with you but we'd might need little bit more time so, um... - About... -No. -So about what then? -About my rent in the atelier. -About rent in the atelier? -Mm-hm. You didn't pay rent or... I owe rent, yes. How much of the owe left? Three months. So how much is in three months? [breathes] Um... almost 15,000. Fifteen thousand. Okay, okay. So, I will call you back when I'm finished with meeting. Ok? Thank you, darling. -Okay. Ciao, ciao. -Thank you. Ciao. -[call dropped] -[sobs] [ominous music] [ominous music continues] [breathes heavily] [sighs] [beeping] [operator speaking Norwegian] [in English] Hi, Barbora. I'm just calling from jail but you can't pick up the phone so I'm calling you later. [Bertil] Okay? Bye. [foreboding music] [metal thudding] [speaking Norwegian] [foreboding music] [Bertil groans] -[man 2] -[Bertil] [man 2] [Bertil] -[man 2] -[Bertil] Hm. -[man 2] -[Bertil] Hm. [Bertil] [man 2] Mm-hm. [Bertil] [man 2 in English] Not bad. [Bertil in Norwegian] [Bertil] [man 2] [man 2] [Bertil] -[man 2] -[Bertil] [device beeping] [keys jangling] [gate clanks] [ominous music] -[razor buzzing] -[indistinct chatter] [Bertil] Hm? [Bertil] -[razor buzzing] -[indistinct chatter] [Bertil] [laughs] [car engine sputtering] [Bertil] [sighs] -[Bertil] -[woman 2] [Bertil] [woman 2] -[smooches] -Hm. [gloomy music] [Bertil] Dear Barbora. I'm looking at my hands, they don't fit me. Or do they? My hands tell so many stories. I just realized how big they are. Soon, I'll be 40 years old. I can see the age of my hands. Forty brutal years that have scarred me. All my defects grow in the dark and die in the light of exposure. A fucking change. My mind is clear, sober, and clean. [indistinct chatter] Today, I have a good life. I began studying to become a nurse. I work part time as a carpenter. My girlfriend is a associate principal at a school in Oslo. We met on online dating and we live in a big, nice apartment with a view over the fjord into Oslo. [engine sputtering] I just bought myself the biggest dream of them all. I finally got myself a Harley Davidson. I hope you're doing good. Let's meet soon. Can I come visit you at your studio? Love and all the best from a decent criminal. [Barbora] Hi, baby. [Bertil] Hi, Barbora. Just checking. Maybe. I come for dinner? Yes. Okay. I'll see what I can find. Okay, baby. Thanks a lot. -Bye. Ciao, ciao. -Thank you very much. I don't like the corner of pizzas. 'Cause it doesn't... You don't like the corner of pizzas either, huh? Of course, I already take the middle. [Bertil] You just start with... just start taking the pieces in the middle. [knocks on door] -Hi. -Hi! We bring food! -How are you? -[both groaning] Nice to see you again! [Barbora sighs] [both chuckle] Nice to have breakfast with you. -Mm-hm. -[chuckles] Did you have any dreams that night? -Hm? -Have you dreamt something? No. When.. But, um, I couldn't sleep. I was just... I was just lying and thinking about how good life was. -Was? -Uh, is. -Is? -Huh... That's a dream good enough? No? Hm. When the heck did I think that for the last time? Hmm. I really think that the couple therapy -is just fucking me up totally. -[chuckles] -That's not... -The more visits I have there, the more shitty I feel about myself. Yeah, but that is just like for now. -It's about... -And this now, it's already like over two months. No, it's about you... And it's just getting worse and worse. Yeah, it will... but it will get better. That you feel like shit is a good thing. It means, because... being in this therapy talking to people, it's like... you start to realize... -How fucked up I am? -think and... and does, and enlighten you in a way. -No. I'm aware of that. -And don't handle it. I sort of, yeah, the handling, that's the part here now. And it takes time. I just, sort of, never thought that I am so fucked up. -Mm-mm. You say fucked up. -You know? Thank you. -I like honesty. -[Bertil laughs] You remember that I told you that I met the other guy name Mikel? The other thief? Hm? No? Wow. Um... Then let me tell you now. [Barbora] I started to search for Mikel when I was making the painting of you. We had is name from the court papers. Your gut feeling got so much to tell you -that this really could be... -No... 73... [clears throat] [call disconnects] [Barbora] But it was impossible to reach him because he was in prison at that time. And then time passed by and many things happened. [foreboding music] [Barbora] And then when he got out of the prison... I was able to reach him. And when... And when... But listen, Bertil, let me talk. -Why can't I never talk? -No. Because you always step into the middle of my sentence. [overlapping dialogue] Your sentence is like eight minutes. I have to talk somewhere. Well, for somebody who doesn't talk the whole day, it's quite a good exercise to have it sometimes for eight minutes. I like that. Thank you. -[Mikel] Hello? -Hello, Mikel. Um, this is Barbora. -Hi. Hi. -I guess you night know who I am. Yes, yes. [Barbora] Hi! Um... Barbora. So nice to meet you, finally. Listen, can we go for coffee or... I just simply would love to hear as much as you can tell me -because it's fascinating for... -Yeah, yeah. I would love to understand as much as possible -about that very day, you know. -Yeah... [Mike] I want to be able to tell you as much as I remember. -Just tell me. -Yeah. I'm really open with one big ear. [Mikel] So, what happened... [Barbora] So he told me all that he remembered. And he's quite surprised that he really remembered a lot. He told me that each of you had taken one painting. And that you have never met since then. And then he even told me where he went with the Swan Song painting. [Mikel] I placed it in the apartment of another gangster. He hide it somewhere or he has sold it to someone. -Okay. -And, um... he know where it is. He must know where it is. It doesn't fly out the window, you know? This is a very sneaky guy. Don't go there alone. No, I won't. Of course, I won't go there all alone. This is a psycho, you know. You will be killed. I even got to know where the Swan Song painting was brought to. -No. -By Mikel. -Really? -Yes. He's a very nasty mafia guy. Sort of like he thinks he's really big and maybe he is. And he's also like physically big, like, you know, working out and being really bad boy. Like really bad boy. [Bertil] You just went to this and knock on door, "Hi, do you have my painting"? [chuckles] -[Barbora] No, not really. -But... What kind of people live there? Well, Mikel said that this is rather dangerous place. He really did not recommend me to go there alone. I'll be there, uh, before... [Barbora] Therefore, he put me in contact with one of his friends who lives there in the neighborhood in the same block of flats like the mafia guy. -[Barbora] That's the seller. -Yeah? Would that make sense you think, too? -[mumbles] -[Barbora] Could we? Could we take a look there as well? I mean, once we are here, you know... -[door slams] -[sighs] [muttering] [mumbling] [wood cracks] Yeah. Wow. [woman 2] Still no sleeping here. -There are people sleeping here? -Yeah. Shit. [Barbora] How do they get here? There's always a way to get somewhere, yeah? [woman 2 muttering] Are you fucking kidding me? Are you fucking kidding me? Are you fucking kidding me? Seriously? [breathing heavily] [woman 2] Oh, my god. [sighs sharply] [whimpering] [moaning] [sighs] You did? -You did? -[Barbora] Mm-hm. -Swan Song? -Yeah. It seems it was just standing there rolled as it was taken from the frame. -Okay. -Where it was placed. So you got it? Well, I found it. [Barbora] So now when we have the Swan Song, we're gonna put up an exhibition. [Bertil chuckles] That's unbelievable. [Barbora] It's absurd as it sounded. I really was willing to, like, suddenly, you know, you get this -I get it. -sea girl. And like should've broke to whatever there was... [Bertil laughing] [Barbora] Yeah, well, of course, I was imagining. Well, now, the police comes and I'll get arrested by searching for my own stolen painting. Why haven't you told me this? Because, Bertil, at the moment when I found the painting, you were leaving Halden prison. -Okay. -And I could not really... could not really imagine how this information would make you feel. Uh, you, had really a lot of your own things to put in order, and I just did not dare to risk that in case you would find this news a little bit disturbing, I just did not want to stir that up in you. -You know, you understand that? -Yeah. It's not that I would... Of course, you were the first person I wanted to call and say... [gasps] -[sighs] -What happened? It's just wasn't the right time until now, I felt. Now is the right time. -All right? -Yeah, good. [thumping] [Barbora] Have you seen that? [Bertil chuckles] -You do, huh? -[Bertil] Hm. [Bertil] This is, uh, this is kinda special. -[both laugh] -[Barbora] Of course. Damn it. Quite special to have you here in that very moment. [tranquil music] [Barbora] It's called déjà vu. [laughs] [Barbora] Let's do it. Yeah, yeah. Hm. [Barbora mutters] [laughing] [tranquil music] [tranquil music continues] Hm. I love the smell of old paintings. [Bertil] Mm-hm. Me too. [sighs] [Barbora] Waa! Look, it's a bit weird though, but... can you hold it for a while? And I'll turn to you. Little... Little, little higher. Just a little. -Here? -Yeas. [Bertil] Can you... I just wonder, uh, if you see something -connect a bit, uh... -[Bertil] No... [Barbora] Yes. I sort of wanted to make connection between these two paintings. You connected your masterpiece with me? [Barbora chuckles] Balanced? [dramatic music] [dramatic music continues] [dramatic music] [dramatic music continues]
