Sir, I'll call you in 10 minutes I'll go to get ready. Take me to the airport. Raha darling, have your breakfast, get ready to come with us. Ok. My sweetie. Hi Mr. Rezaee... I'll talk with him and let you know The mini mouse's mommy was wise and mature woman. She looked at the guests and said... Yay! Give a clap to my daughter. My sweetheart Hey! Be careful What is it to me? The motorbike cut me off You are the one who should be careful! With such a driving you wanted to drive on the road? That wasn't my fault! Pull over here, I'm getting off Give me a kiss, sweetie At least show mercy to her… let us go! Cut it out. you're getting on my nerves. I've already said no "Here you are ma'am" "I'm good." "Yes." "I love you too" Sweetie, there you go…Who is it? It's daddy Goodbye. Hang on Hey, I was gone to buy her water for taking her pills. The car was right in front of the kiosk. I was seeing her. Did you call to just say this? Sorry… I have a call waiting. Bye Hello. it's myself! Can I help you? Hi Mrs. Asgari, how are you? How is Sadaf? Yes, I'm by your home's parking Ok, I'm waiting here Mrs. Amiri? I'm sorry to disturb you Not a problem…What's up? Sadaf has not came back home since yesterday that she's gone to school. I called a thousand people. No one has any news from her. Even I called the police and at the end I called the school today to inform them. The principal gave me your number and said she's talked to you after that incident. I wanted to see if she has told you anything? No, she didn't tell me anything special. They are highly sensitive at this age. We need to understand them more. What about you? Hasn't she talked to yourself? It has never happened that she would talk about her personal matters with us. I got shocked when the principal told me that she had taken pills yesterday. I couldn't say anything to her dad yet. Please tell me if you know anything Hi sir, Is Mr. Mani in? "No! He is not" When is he coming back? "I don't know, I haven't heard from him in 2,3 days" Would you please give me his contact number? - Sorry, I can't I'm from his acquaintances.

She looks so pretty. Where's dad? "He is right here" "Hey! I'm here!" Hi Grandpa Hi "Hi" here is our bride and groom "I wonder whether the refinery would've stopped working if... Hamed would've gone with two days delay?" You intellectuals, couldn't throw your wedding party in town? "Hopefully next husband!" "Yasi? It's from excitement of the wedding! Don't get her wrong dear Armin." "I'm use to it." "The wedding ceremony is tomorrow." "Talk with Hamed again. He may let you come." I've already told him. How many times should I say? "Ok dear" We'll talk later have a great time together "Thanks. Take care" "Bye Raha" Bye Bye Because of her beautiful body like silver I forgot my own body and life For her, I was striving from the depths of my soul I carried her with me home Her hair, was tossed and thrown by the wind and rain in her hair, like pure spinning pearls slept At last for my lover and I, the difficult path came to an end With me giving her a warm kiss With lips like sugar Momy, should I bring my paint notebook? Yes, darling! You can bring it Just put on your clothes. We're too late as it is! Ok Hurry up! Mom, please send me the address and its location and...

I'll find that bastard It was about 7:30-ish We came here There was no parking space next to the doctor's office and I parked at the top of the alley Ok, then the car hit you at the top of the street? Or here in the middle of the alley? I mean... did the car hit you by the street or in the alley? Inside the alley What was the color of the car or its brand? I don't know. I was no conscious afterwards. Who took you to the hospital? I don't know Hamed! I said I was unconscious Right, that alley is the doctor's. Where did you park? A little further Tell me exactly! Right here! Here? Then which way did you head to? Towards the doctor's office obviously Go the exact way you had gone Where did the car hit you? Show me exactly I told you a hundred times. In the middle of the alley Thanks Seems at that time there was no one but it's possible to check the CCTVs. Let's go to the police The medical examiner's certification. The burial permit? It's with my Father-in-law. We don't have them now You should have brought them I'll see what I can do... Is she your wife who was in the accident? Yes She also has to sign the statements Lady, please sign here and write your personal information Why did you come so late to make a complain? - I wasn't in Tehran... and then we all weren't feeling well. I understand. Weird, but there's no report of this accident Can you make an inquiry? I'm gonna ask again but it takes about 2 or 3 hours It's ok. Take your time They brought the CCTVs' footages of a café and an agency... but they haven't cover all the angles Fortunately, there was a company's CCTV at the end of the alley... which could capture the whole area For now, you can check this film while we are working on the inquiry Thanks I'll be back soon "Please zoon in on this..." "Rewind it please!" Sara? Sara, you weren't in an accident at all.- "Sir, lower your voice." So what were you telling me these days? "Keep your voice down" Why didn't you tell me the truth? Why did you lie to me? What did you do to my child asshole? Why did you lie to me? Why are you not saying anything? Talk! talk! Sara, I'll kill you. What did you do to my baby? I won't let you get out of here alive.- "Calm down sir!" "Keep your voice down" You killed my child I won't let you get out of here alive What did you do to my child asshole? Talk! Why did you lie to me? Why are you not saying anything? Hamed? Dear Hamed! Dear Hamed… Sarah was in such a bad place that she didn't even dare tell you the truth. Believe me She wasn't feeling well! What about you? You should have told me. We were no better. I swear to god we're doing worse than you Father, nice going! I called you on that wedding night, couldn't you have told me? You are absolutely right! I'll explain. I have nothing to say to you. Even if I have something to say, I'll say it in court. I'm also suing both of you come in Where are you going ma'am? She's my daughter You can't Only the plaintiff and the complainant can go inside According to this petition... you accused her of killing your daughter. And the file contains a note from the medical examiner about gas asphyxiation I don't accuse her of murder I beleive what she did led to my daughter's death given that I advised against this trip several times as her husband and the father of the child. Why did you go on a trip without informing your spouse? No comment! let her speak! Please go on… Not only did she go on this trip without informing me she also told me a bigger lie This incident happened in the North... but her family told me the accident happened in Tehran. She staged the whole thing "Where are you going?" "I just need a signature sir." Why did you come in? Please stay outside. We need security at the door so no one comes in. Either way, I don't trust her anymore. How can I believe that the cause of my child's death is asphyxiation? How do you know my child didn't die from something else? There is a death certificate in the file, and we proceeding based on that But he's the natural guardian If they prove you were guilty of negligence, you will be convicted So please explain keeping silent won't help you OK then! Due to the complaint and charges against you you are temporarily free on a bail bond Sign here, please. Not even A word! You too, sign here please Sir, my daughter has done nothing. It was an accident. She's emotionally crushed. She was her child too. Are you her mother? Yes She is temporarily free on bail until the investigation is complete. Why bail? What has she done? Please complete the paperwork so she doesn't have to spend the night in jail. You need to be present as a witness in the next court session. Tell her to talk next time so we can figure this out. Hi Hi Hi What happened dad? Were be able to talk to him? I went after him but he didn't want to hear it... He's right! What do you mean? If I were him, I would feel the same He is also angry What a jerk! I should call his mother He doesn't talk to us anymore Sara, dear... please don't take sedatives anymore I rang the door bell a few times, he didn't answer What a jerk! He doesn't answer the phone. Won't open the door! Sina please! I tell you! Is my sister a murderer?! Watch what you are saying! He's beaten her, and you didn't say anything Didn't you say his sister has convinced him to meet us? That was what she said! She said he'd arrive around 3:00 o'clock. It's 3:30 now! There he is! "Hello my dear Hamed." Hi Hamed Listen to us just for a moment "I have nothing to say to you." Hey you! Don't you hear them talking to you? Sina please! That's quite enough! Hamed, please…just for a second Who do you think you are? They're talking to you! Sina, that's ok. Sina... stop this! You jerk; you should be ashamed of yourself! I'm talking to you. How dare you beat her? You piece of shit Mind your language! You should watch your behavior! Hello Mrs. Asgari It was midnight that they called us to go for body identification. They had found Sadaf under a bridge. She had bled to death from the abortion. From the cameras on the bridge they saw that she was with a guy. They were apparently arguing and he suddenly leaves Her body was found there Oh God! I'm so sorry At the medical examiner's office, we found out she was pregnant. She hadn't come home because she was afraid. If I had known earlier I might have been able to help her. She called once and told me not to worry. I don't even know the guy she was with. I found this photo on her Instagram I don't know any of them. I knew all her classmates and friends. Take a look and see if you recognise anyone? I need your help No! I don't know them Mrs, Asgari.- "Yes!" I knew she was pregnant.- "What?" I had promised not to tell anyone "Why are you saying this now?" I didn't know if I should tell you "If I had known, then maybe she would be alive today!" I told her to talk to you the day she went to get the abortion. Maybe I should have insisted "You should have told me" There's something else She had told me that her boyfriend owns the cafe next to the school. "Wait a minute! I'll be right down" The day you said she was missing, I went to look for him but I couldn't find him I'm sorry if this is all too late "Mrs. Amiri wait! I'm coming down now" Well, Madam, did you finally decide to talk? Look, my daughter is not well Hamed, you know it was an accident Why are you putting yourself and us through this? She's in shock and hasn't cried since the day it happened. Why are you doing this to yourselves I asked you to come to the trial just to testify Everything is in the statement The wedding guests can testify too. There's no lie! I didn't say you were lying You hide this from me and in my eyes you're accomplices Hamed… Mr. Amiri I read your statements This case does not have a public complainant because negligence has not been determined as the cause of death. But the private complainant is the natural guardian So only the father can give consent We went to his house several times to talk to him but he won't listen to us anymore He doesn't even let us speak It would help if you talk to your husband instead of keeping silent Maybe an apology? You are also a mother, and you understand what I'm saying! We need to help them get through this "I don't know what to say" She really wasn't well and even now she's not much better We didn't say anything about the fight at the police station in court. "We also don't want them to get hurt" "But Hamed has a right to be upset" "Everyone lied to him" "Sarah, her mum and dad!" yeah that's right But we were all in a tough situation "We'll speak to him again" "I may ask our uncle to talk to him too" "I'm trying to arrange a face-to-face so we all can speak to him." "I hope we can convince him to consent" Thanks Maryam, say hello to your mother and your uncle thank you dear, bye- "Yes sure! bye" "Hamed... it's time to forgive... and get over it... Don't do this to yourselves." "We understand your feelings... You both have been through hell... It's enough." "The unexpected has happened! We are all suffering... Sara is pretty messed up." "You are completely right! Losing a child is painful, but she was also her mother." It was an accident! It wasn't deliberate. "Undoubtedly!" Please forgive her Dear Hamed, you should forgive, let time heal the pain Time heals... Please help yourselves Thanks a lot Hi Hi I'm going to the airport, I have a mission and then you drive back home It was night, it was wilderness, it was winter It was a squall, abundantly cold My lover in my arms was distress From the cold, she was depressed and without life Because of her beautiful body like silver I forgot my own body and life For her, I was striving from the depths of my soul I carried her with me home Her hair, was tossed and thrown by the wind and rain in her hair, like pure spinning pearls slept SAHAR DOLATSHAHI PEJMAN JAMSHIDI AZITA HAJIAN HASSAN POURSHIRAZI 180° RULE Writer and Director FARNOOSH SAMADI Producer ALI MOSAFFA Funded by DORSAY SHAFIE Line poducer MAHAN HEIDARI Director Of Photography MASSOUD SALAMI Edit MEISAM MOLAEI Sound Designing And Mix AMIRHOSSEIN GHASSEMI Music PEYMAN YAZDANIAN Sound On Set AMIR NOBAKHT, AMPS Make Up Artist MEHRDAD MIRKIANI Set Designing SIAMAK KARINEJAD Costume SARA KHALEDI Production Manager JAVAD RAHZANI First Planner And Assistant Director CHAVOSH HONARAMOOZ Gilan Province's Planner ARASH NAEIMIAN Script Supervisor GHAZAL RASHIDI Still Photographer HABIB MAJIDI, SMPSP Cast: AYLIN JAHED AMIRREZA RANJBARAN SADAF ASGARI MOHAMMAD HEIDARI MANIKA DERAKHSHANDEH ROYA SALIMI NAVID BANI NAVA NEMATI KATAYOON SALEKI DORREH HELALAT HADI EFTEKHARZADEH SAFOORA KAZEMPOOR ALBORZ AEENI MILAD SHEYBANI AREF BERAHMAN HAMED TAVAKOLI SARVIN ZABETIAN PARDIS SHIRVANI RAMTIN MOAYYEDPOUR ERFAN AFSHARIPOUR Thanks to: ALI ASGARI FRANCOIS MORISSET MARCIN LUCZAJ RANI MASSALHA WOUTER JANSEN LEA TRIBOLET
