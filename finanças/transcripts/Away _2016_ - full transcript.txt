You ever heard of knocking? Wanna go to the beach? I might go for a paddle in a minute. You coming in? No, it's too cold. This is the life, isn't it? Why, Kaz? What'd you do that for? Clark's gonna piss it down. Get off. Get off! Do you feel that? Oh, it's Kaz. You want it? Yeah. Do you want to take it? Do you? After everything I've done for you, this is how you repay me? Everything you've done for me? What the fuck is wrong with you! It's okay, it's okay. I love you. ♪ Where I stand on my own ♪ Are the pieces of my heart ♪ A ruptured soul, I'm so cold ♪ The hollow cries, the silent talks ♪ ♪ There's no peace here in the dark ♪ ♪ When all have fled, the love is dead ♪ ♪ So far away ♪ So far away Kaz, it's me. Listen, I've gotta lie low for a little while. Dex might be looking for me. So don't let him in, all right? There's money in the music box in the cupboard. Take it, and get on the 12:20 train for Platform Six tomorrow. 12:20, Platform Six, yeah? You can't call me cause my phone's knackered. Oh, you won't recognize the number, but it'll start with 0-1-2-5-3. Things are about to change for us, babe. I promised I was gonna get us out of there. All right, get on that train. I love you, see you soon. Bye. You can't play this game, come on. Why? You know why. Fuck you. I'm leaving. No. Yeah, I'm going. All right, all right. Out. What's your name? Ria. What you doing in Blackpool, Ria? Some stuff I need to shift. Best around. What's your name? Damo. All right. See you later, Ria. Hello? Anybody in here? Ugh. You in there? Yeah. Well you better not be having a shit, yeah? Cause I don't need to see that. I'm coming in, all right? Oh shit! Fuck. Ah! Fuck! How many have you taken? Oi, oi, come here. How many have you taken, yeah? How many have you taken? Open your mouth, I've gotta get it out! Hey, get off me! I've gotta get it out of your system! Get off, get out of here! Fool! You tried to top yourself with four codeine. I mean seriously man, that's pathetic. I hadn't finished. You hadn't even started. You know, finding you OD'ed isn't why I came here. Why are you here? I didn't invite you. I need a drink. Here. That's not a drink. Are you sure that's a good idea? You have had four painkillers. I'm not around. Page me after the tone, I'll try and get back to you. Oi, you got a phone I can borrow? Mine's broken. No! Oh great, so I'm stuck with the only man in the world who doesn't have a mobile. I didn't say I don't have one, you asked me if I had one to borrow. And you're not with me, this is just proximity, that's all. I'm Ria, pleased to meet you. Oi, look. This is the part where you tell me your name, yeah? Look, if you don't tell me, I'm just gonna make one up for you. You can stop me when you hear one you like. - Fred, John, Mick. - Oh, Jesus. Bert, Alan. Doug, Dougie, Mike. You said Mike. No, I said Mick. Karl, Ron, Arthur, Jake. Oh, just stop! Dick. You look like a dick. Ah, Jesus. Really? It's Joseph. My name's Joseph. Are you sure it's not Mary? Joseph. Can I call you Joe? No. Joseph. What are you looking at? Do you want to tell me your secret? She hasn't taken her eyes off you since she walked in. What do you call her? Call what? Um, a young girl who likes older men... Not a cougar, what is it? You know what I call it? A godsend. Gives men like us hope. I'm married. I love my wife. Of course you do. And I love mine. Each and every one of them. But a girl like that... What you looking at? For a drink, I need ID or phone number. I'm his daughter. I better uh... Yeah, you should. You sick bastard. Well the drugs don't work, so you're gonna drink yourself to death? Listen, I can't babysit you. I've got business to take care of. Business, oh yeah. What business? None of yours. All right. Fuck you. You want some help? Ugh. Why, I'll get it. Just go! I'll see you tomorrow, yeah? Alive and well? Bright and breezy? You could show me the sights. Hey. What? Things will seem better in the morning. Yeah? Night then. Shut up! I'll open her or something. You want to warm me up? Fuck off, yeah? Giving blowjobs tonight? I said fuck off. No, that's my money! You get the fuck away from her! Get the fuck away from her! You don't know who the fuck we are! We're gonna fuck you up! Oh, fuck. Wake. Hey, wake up! You said you were coming for me yesterday. I don't know what this... It's Tanya. No, it's me. Get it back. It's me. It's Ria. It's all right, I'm sure, I'm sure. Yeah, of course you have. I'm all right, thank you, thank you. Get off! Mm, I hate it when you go. I told you, you don't have to work. I'll look after you. You do look after me. I miss her. I know. ♪ I go dancing by myself ♪ I go dancing with no one else ♪ ♪ Solo dancing, push me as I go ♪ ♪ I go dancing, it's so intense ♪ ♪ I will dance 'til the bitter end ♪ ♪ No point in asking ♪ Cause I always dance alone ♪ Hypnotized by the raw emotion ♪ ♪ Music stop, and the spell is broken ♪ ♪ I go dancing by myself ♪ I go dancing with no one else ♪ ♪ Solo Who's Tanya? She your wife? I knew it. I could read people, I can. I'd make a shit hot interrogator. Like that woman detective off the telly, the one who always gets her tits out. Just so you know, I'm not gonna get my tits out. I'm going. Going where? Just going. Yeah, well we're having a nice chat. What, about tits and telly? What do you want to talk about? Nothing. We could still hang out though. Oh yeah, hang out? You're just a kid. I've been a lot of things. But a kid isn't one of them! You've gotta meet my sister in a couple of hours, I think you'll like her. Is she anything like you? Not really. I probably would then. No. Don't go yet. Just come finish your tea first. Oi, slow down! Will you stop following me? I'm not following you. It's just proximity. Get off me, you les. Where you been anyway? Work. You ever heard of it? Yes, Mom. Don't call me that. You know, I think I preferred you when you was a fuck up. All right, I am following you. But we're the same, you and me, we need to stick together. We're not the same. Well, we've got things in common. We've got nothing in common. Exactly what have we got in common? We're both fucked. Whoa. Wow. 158 meters to the top of the flagpole. 2,533 tons of steel, 94 tons of cast iron. It's based on the Eiffel Tower, in Paris. I know where the Eiffel Tower is. Let's go. Where, up there? No, to France. Of course up there. No chance. Why not? I can't do heights. Oh, come on. Listen, if you're lucky, when we get up there... I'll push you off, put you out of your misery. I buried mine. I read somewhere once that if you save a life, you're responsible for that life. You think you saved me? You really believe that? Well I-- Well let me tell you something. You didn't save me, you can't save me, nobody can. Stop running away! I'm not running, I'm walking. Look, walking. Hello? Parcel for you. You want to help Ria, you have to listen to me. What's she done? Can we talk about it inside? All right. I've got your money. Five minutes, all right? What's happened to your leg? I fell off my bike. Why did you do it? You go near her again and I'll kill you! I was only helping her out. Just like I helped you out. She's just a kid. Oh, she's a lot of things, but a kid? That isn't one of them. Stop! She came to me, all right? You're sick, you're sick. I'd give her a minute, lad. Mate? You know, if it wasn't for me... You'd still be sleeping in shop doorways, tossing off strangers for loose change, wouldn't you? Give us a minute, yeah? Are you deaf? I'll give you one more chance. Turn around, and walk the fuck away. Okay? Shoot me. Do it. Who are you? You stay there. Or I'll pull this trigger, I fucking swear it. So do it. Don't talk about it, do it. I'll shoot you, I swear to God. Oh come on, shoot me now. Do it, please. You're a fucking madman. Wake up! Follow through! Fuck you! Come on. Come on! You did great the other day. You earned this. Bloody more where that came from. What has she done? She stole from me. Know anything about any drugs? I know a lot about a lot of drugs, junky. Was a junky. Well the problem is, the stuff they took from me, they belong to someone else-- Dave. Someone helped her, older bloke in his 50s. She ever mention him? I just want to help her. And to help her, I need to know where she is. I don't know where she is. Check this out! Woo! I sweat a pound for every mile we've walked along here. You know, talking to yourself is the first sign of madness. You didn't tell me you were a doctor. Well, now you know. Psychotherapist, no less. Absolutely. Is there anything you want to talk about? You never asked me why he had a gun in my face. None of my business. What, you're not even a little bit curious? No. I've only been around you for a few hours, and I want to stick a gun in your face. I was right, you are a dick. Is that your professional opinion? Yes. You're probably right. What, you're happy with that assessment? I don't care what you think, I don't care what anybody thinks. I like you. There, I said it. You like me? What the hell's wrong with you? Give me your phone. What? Give me your phone. See, I think you know exactly where she is. I don't, I swear. This number. 0-1-2-5-3. Who's that? I'm not sure. Called at 3:40 yesterday. It's probably a wrong number. Lasted over a minute, they must've had something to say. Oh, should we answer that? Come on, don't laugh. Let's go in and answer it. Hello, who's this? Carol! Hello, Carol. Tell me, where are you love? In a phone box. In Blackpool, love. Do you want to know where we are, then? Here you go. Now you're gonna miss your train. The truth doesn't cost anything. But a lie could cost you everything. I read that somewhere. Something for the pain. Where's your sister? She'll be here. Not if she's got any sense. I thought you liked it here? I used to. Then why come? Seemed appropriate. Come on, I love roller coasters. Not over my dead body. Stuck in Blackpool with the most boring man on the planet. You are not with me. But you do admit you're the most boring man on the planet. No, I don't. And I'm not. Prove it. Oh, fuck. You're not feeling the urge to jump yet? Not yet, no. Not just. When you're around, the urge is never far away. I'll let you know if I need your help, all right? Fine. Just give me the nod, yeah? I will. So on a clear day, you can see south Pool from here. What is it with young people today? Visiting all sick and all dancing, moving a million miles an hour. It's an adrenaline fix, they're not interested. But what is it with old people today? Boring. Old? I'm not old. How old do you think I am? I don't know. Like 70. No, 57. Woo. That's pretty old, Jozy. Anyway, I thought you didn't care what people think. You must miss her. How did she die? Huntington's. It's a disease of the nervous system. But then you'd know all about that, wouldn't you? Being the doctor. Psychotherapist. Any kids? We were told that there was a 50/50 chance that any children she had would inherit her condition, so she didn't think it was worth the risk. It was the only thing we ever argued about. My mom died when I was 12. I'm sorry about that. No, don't be. It was the best thing that ever happened to me. You shouldn't talk like that. Hey. I'm a glass half full type of girl. I mean like now, for instance. You say you don't like heights, but on the positive side, you're a 158 meters closer to your wife. You could probably shout and she'd hear you. Tanya! Hey, Tanya! What are you doing? What does it look like? Joseph wants to talk to you! Joseph's right here! Stop it! Can you tell him to cheer up, please? He's a right grumpy bastard! Right, I'm going back down. Here, girls. Come on, come to daddy. You on the train yet? Look, you gotta get off at Blackpool north. I told you to keep your phone on. Fuck. Fuck. Come on. Shit! You got our room? Life goes on, Joe. Remember? Joseph! What are you doing? You trying to knock the bloody door down? Wow. I mean, I know I asked you to show me the sights, but that's not really what I meant. Oh... Got back at night, think I didn't need anything. You realize you've probably scarred me for life? Well, I'd love to stand and chat... I have a very fragile mind. Will you move your foot. Yeah. All right. What's the magic word? Now. You've gotta lighten up, Joe. Life goes on. I need to get dressed. Yeah, you really do. Oh, fuck. So beautiful, so sad. Do you think they know that they're trapped? You're only trapped if you allow yourself to be. So why did you have a gun stuck in your face? He thinks I stole from him. Did you? Trust me, he stole from me first. It's funny... I feel safe with you. No one's safe with me. My mom used to disappear for days when she was on one of her benders. She'd come crawling back, promising it wasn't gonna happen again. Until it did. Jim next door used to take me in. I was a nosy little kid. Never! One day I found all these books in Jim's spare room. All these kids books. He never had any kids, so I always thought that was weird. I used to read them for hours. Just getting lost in them. I got to the point where I actually started praying my mom wouldn't home come so I could just take myself away and escape. One day she gave them to me, a whole box. Ah, it was the best thing ever. The first thing I did was write my name in every single one, make sure they were mine. She wouldn't take them back. One day I came home, and they'd all gone. Except the one I was reading. I found out my mom had taken the whole lot and tried to swap them for gear. She couldn't, she just left them somewhere. She couldn't even remember where. All the shit she heaped on me, all the drama. It was the one thing I never forgave her for. When she died, I felt nothing. What happened then? Four years in care, and then I ran away. Dex took me off the streets, and I thought all my problems were over. Compared to him, my mom was Mary freakin' Poppins. You know, even with all the shit that's happened, I've never wanted to top myself. There's always good stuff to balance out the bad. Can I ask you something? No. Did you really wanna kill yourself? Or was it like a cry for help? A cry for help? I saw you pick up the gun in the bathroom. More effective than pills, don't you think? There are over 1,500 different species of jellyfish. Certain higher medusa jellyfish only live for a few hours. But in those few hours, they glow with the most incredible luminescence. They reproduce. They do everything they were brought on this earth to do. Was that a yes or a no then? What? The gun. What do you think? How am I supposed to know? Well, come on. You have an opinion about everything else. All right. I mean I think that... I think... Shit. I need to find a phone. Ah, I should've called Kaz. Here, here, here, here, here. Damn it, I need to phone her. Always the winder. What? What's wrong with that? Don't you want it? Yeah, what? A solid phone, that is. I once stored that in a vat of liquid cashew. I was helping my brother on one of his farms. Then when we retrieved it, I had three missed calls. Didn't miss a beat. I'd get it over one of them clever smartphones. Kaz, where the fuck are you? Yeah, you're supposed to be here now, your phone's been going to voicemail. What? Why, calm down. What do you mean he knows? Yeah. Um, stay where you are, and just... Oi, stop crying babe, yeah? No, stay right there, and keep your phone with you, yeah? All right, all right. I've gotta go. He's here. Who? Who do you think? Ugh. There was stuff that I needed to do, and then you've distracted me. I distracted you? Oh goodness. Yeah, um. Oi. Come with me. No I'm serious, come with me, yeah? No, I've got things I need to do here. What, like kill yourself? Oh, if you need to go, then just go. I can't. I can't leave you. I don't need a babysitter, just go, I'll be fine. Well, I won't be. Look, remember when I said that if you save a life, you are then responsible for that life. Yeah, you are responsible for that life, yeah. Is that it? You think you're responsible for me? Responsible for you? Well, you think you saved me. Saved you? No. You want to know what I think Joseph, what I really think? I think I've taken more tablets for a headache. I think you're a hero. A real life knight in shining armor. I didn't save you, you saved me. No. I told you. I feel safe with you, yeah? Like nothing bad could happen-- Stop! You don't know me. You don't know what I'm capable of. Listen, I know exactly what you're capable of, I saw it with my own eyes. Do you want me to spell it out, is that what you want? What? What, Joseph? What, are you stupid? You just don't get it, do you? I wasn't there to save you, I came into that stinking bog for one reason, and one reason only. For a bullet. I haven't come here to watch over you, to look after you, or to save you, I don't really care what happens to you! ♪ Vanish my heart ♪ Lost in illusion ♪ It feels like I'm losing myself ♪ ♪ Losing myself ♪ No sights or sounds ♪ No sense of reason ♪ It feels like I'm losing myself ♪ ♪ Losing myself ♪ I'm so alone ♪ I'm so alone ♪ It feels like I'm losing myself ♪ Wait a minute, Ria. Ria! What do you want? Look, um... You finished? Where you going with that? What do you care? Is Angie in? I don't know no Angie. Damo told me to come round. Damo! Turn that shit off. There's another CD on the top there. You're welcome. Sorry. But you can't be too careful. Lucky me. Is this it? Yeah. So what do you think of our town? Its okay. Vegas of the north they call it. You think they've ever been to Vegas? What you looking for? Huh? What you looking for, for all of that? I don't know. About six? 10 grand worth of stuff here. Probably more. I know. I need six, that's all I need, yeah? What will she think? Why don't I just kick you out now and keep the stuff? Or let my lads have their fun with you, and then kick you out. But you've got balls, I'll give you that. Either that, or you're desperate. So which is it? You know, I saw you at the arcade the other day. You looked lost. I've got a thing for waifs and strays. You know, this place was in all the guidebooks. Four star, ran it with my husband. When he decided he'd had enough of being in the hotel business, and of being married. Yeah, well... Let's just say life presented me with other opportunities. Where is she? What are you on about? Where is she? Whoa, what the fuck? Hey, she's downstairs. What? She's downstairs. Okay, get in, get in. Stay there. Freeze. Stay there. Stay where you are. I tell you what. I'll give you three. But there's 10 grand worth of stuff here. Yeah, it's a buyer's market, sweetness. Take it or leave it. Don't move. Come on. Come on. No, what the fuck are you doing here Joseph? No! You've gone mental! Keep going, go! Stop it, stop it! Go, stay where you are! Stop it, no! I need that! I have to get that money! Get out! No, I have to go back! - Go! - I have to go back! What the fuck was that? I thought you were in trouble. I was about to get paid! I saw what was in your bag. Yeah, and I saw what was in yours, so don't you fucking judge me. I'm sorry. Why have you even bothered? I mean, you made it perfectly clear you don't give a shit. You said you wanted a knight in shining armor, well... Here I am. Don't make me laugh. Kaz? You home? Hey. Oi! You've been in there all day. I thought you had an interview. Hey! What the fuck happened? Look at her face now, look at her face. What the fuck! Proof of identity. Okay. Ria? I'd like to talk to you. What do you think? I preferred the angry trump look. It was a long time ago. I'm a bad man. I'm going to hell. What are you on about? What do you mean you're going to hell? She's not my sister, not really. We met in care. When I got into the gear she just followed, and I did nothing to stop it. Then I got clean, and she couldn't. Now who's going to hell? She'd been having suicidal thoughts for a couple years before she started the courage to carry them out. And then she got pneumonia. It was just a matter of time. I couldn't stand to see her like that. I was supposed to follow straight after but... I killed my wife but I can't... I'm not even sure why I did it. When her suffering oughta been mine. What's that? Fear will bring you to the place where your heart is. You should go somewhere with me. Will you accompany me? Where? You Colin? Yep. I'm Ria. Oh, all right. Well, show me then. I was told you know people, yeah? Oh, I know people all right. Well wait round there. Going somewhere nice? No. Yeah, me neither. Don't need any thanks. No! Look... Dex, no! I look like a knob. No you don't, you look beautiful. You? Dancer? Yeah, sort of. Tanya and I used to come here all the time. Seriously? I mean, other than the odd twerk off with Kaz, I don't dance. Twerk off? Sounds Russian. No, it... No. What? Right, come on. Follow me. Right, now, look, watch. One, two, three, one, two, three, one, two, three. - One-- - Two, three. - Don't look at your feet. - What? Right, just, just right. That's it, just look up. Feel. Just feel. That was pretty good, yeah? Yeah, well, they might be able to save a few of my toes. Oi. So we've done what you want. Now it's my turn. Your turn? Yeah. No. Yes. I can't. Yes you can! Well, I don't want to. Yes you do, and you'll be fine. Absolutely out of the question. You okay? I should've done that years ago. You've got a nice smile. You should do that more often. Get off. I've got something for you. Detached, for the drive. Sell it, do what you want with it. Your house? There's no mortgage. Use the money, get away, start again. I called my solicitor, he faxed the papers over. Signed, witnessed. Oh yeah, one thing. You've just gotta show proof of identity. He thinks I've lost my marbles. You have. Oh yeah, he's gonna call you. Have this. I'm not gonna need it anymore. What are you gonna do? Stay here and drink yourself to death? You make it sound like a bad idea. I don't want your house. And they say romance is dead. Oh shit. Come on, come on! Let's just talk to him. Ria. Ria! These stupid fucking shoes! Come on Joseph! Hurry up! Come on Joseph! Ria! Shit. Wait, what are you doing Ria? Go through! Joseph, come. Come on, here, look! Fuck! Here, girl. Come to daddy. Let's go, come on. You thought I wouldn't fucking find you here? Just stop it, stop it, stop it! Let's talk about it. Yeah, we could. Or you could give me back the stuff you stole from me! It has nothing to do with him. Yeah, well it is now. Where is it? I haven't got it. So get it. I can't. You realize what you've done? That wasn't my gear. Look. She did have it, she hasn't got it now. And I'm afraid to say that's down to me, but we can work this out, okay? No! No! I swear I'll do it. Go on then. A walking dead man holds no fear of death, for his only enemy are the last few hours of life. Do you know who said that? Of course not. You know, all I ever tried to do was help you. No, you used me! We used each other. Listen. Ria's got money in her property. She could compensate you. What are you playing at, Ria? I'm not playing, I'm not playing. Or maybe we can come to some kind of arrangement. No! Yes. Stop talking! No! Drop the gun. Stop it! No. Only you can stop it, Ria. Go on, drop it. Do it. That's it. Good girl. You shouldn't have gone after Kaz. But she wanted it. She wanted to be just like you. Don't listen to him. Drop the fucking gun. You know, she never had any willpower. Once you've broken an animal, you can pretty much make it do what you want. Let him go. Let him go. And then you'll come with em? Yes. Ria, Ria, don't, don't. Don't you remember what I said to you at the top of the tower? If I need your help-- Shut up. Well, I really need it now. Shut the fuck up! Pick up the gun. Oh yeah. You kick the gun over here, yeah? Pick up the gun. Don't pick it up. Shoot him. You fucking shoot him, Ria. Do it, Ria. Don't do it. That's it. Ria, Ria. Do you want him to fucking die? I'll cut his throat, I swear it. That's it. It's the only way. Oh, you think this is a fucking video game? Do it. Ria. Do it. Please. Please. You fucking bitch. Give me that, give me that. Ria, give me the gun. Carefully disgusting. Oh, this is bad. There's always good stuff to balance out the bad. I held off for hours, just talking. I didn't want to let it go. Do me a favor, will you? I need her to forgive me. She forgives you. She loves you. You've set me free. I want you to have a great life. You deserve it. Go. What about him? You don't have to worry about him anymore. What are you waiting for? Christmas? You're dead.
