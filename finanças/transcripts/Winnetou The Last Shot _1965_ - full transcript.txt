And the great fertile hunting grounds of the Mescalero Apache-... their chief Winnetou always and ever faithful. He lived ... during the period of bloom After the American Civil War ... when many immigrants crossing dared. The need to colonize areas in the West is growing. The efforts of the leaders to keep the peace ... failure by the rapid on_ikkelingen ... human failure, ego'isme and betrayal. The habitat of the Indians is becoming smaller. They are threatened with collapse. Winnetou sees the impending doom. He tirelessly tries the danger. My brothers look with red Winnetou on the land of our fathers. Mountains, rivers, forests and fertile pasture land where grazing bumels. Winnetou was happy that peace is closed between us and showed the faces. But he is not reassured, because not every is willing to keep the law. There is gemaaM hunting on the herd. Shame on you. Why would we? You fall to us. You shoot off the bumels while there is no hunger. I embarrassed me, Winnetou. -Keep your mouth. I never knew this would happen. You should keep your mouth. You've participated. We want our horses and weapons back. Here goes much change. Watch your words. You Hunting without suffering hunger. Three warriors are dead. She wanted to warn you. They fell behind to us. Go back to your country. You get your horses and a knife. There you are on our territory no hair aggrieved. There is peace closed. You keep weapons Winnetou as proof of his accusation. I wanted to say ... -Get your gun but. This I will not forget, Winnetou. Wait, young friend. Be wary opje. Winnetou saw greed, cunning and murder in the eyes of those men. Go now. I thank you My brother. I am from Clinton. There is an endless stream pioneers together. It is there 's just so loud nachb as daytime. I had nostalgia for the past when chief Intschu-yet Tchuna lived. A great time. Winnetou also _am here to look back on what once was. Want to tell my brother what concerned him? Winnetou has decided to move to Santa Fe to drive. The face said it appeared that soon everything otherwise it will be for the Apache. Winnetou adheres to peace. He should know ... or the white father in Washington is prepared to speak to. Does my brother out that Santa Fe unknown dangers threatening? There has Winnetou thought. He will be the new time face with open eyes. It will be the first time that Winnetou is a white city. He is glad that his white brother him overruling state. Winnetou knew this man. He had to die because he believed in the good. What is that? Church Bells. They urge all Christians for prayer. Winnetou knows that showed faces pray so that their soul is in heaven. The red people hope that their souls in the eternal hunting grounds is. The words vary, but perhaps is the same intention. Winnetou think since the last time often over. The clock now speaks to Winnetou and he understands its appeal. Oh yeah? The clock says: Do all the good love. All the evil and hatred. I thank you voorie coming. If I can do something for you, than I do that. I have my hopes on Winnetou established. If you need help, Iaat me know. I send as many soldiers as needed wherever you want. There is a great chaos. There attract large flows pioneers via Santa Fe to Clinton. Wifte Bumel the country he seeks to We disposed suddenly back. White Buffalo has the whites Learning fire water to drink. He is addicted to hit and now acts as a slave. Unscrupulous dealers are there of abuse. In men walk around Clinton who conclude deals with the pioneers. They promise a piece of land against huge payments. I still do not know who is head of the gang. Each month, a barrel of brandy Witte Bumel delivered to. There is even talk of arms shipments. Only chief Winnetou and Mr. Shatterhand ... can reverse the threat. I have decided how to be a way ... Get Scott. Hii must From Morgan. ... the new situation, the white father in Washington decided ... the field of Chic's Aria to increase. Winnetou will him this message. Let him promise that he to hold the convention ... so that the pioneers get their country. The Chic-Aria's his horse thieves. The word of vuunNaterdrinkers is not worth much. Will my brother Winnetou guide? Winnetou let me in the lurch if I'm in danger? Make the paper from Washington ready. Winnetou and Old Shatterhand leave today. I make them immediately in order. Be careful. There are many men, slechb but few are as h. Winnetou is glad that he is a white met who, like his brother ... unselfish and honest. I wish the whole amount for me and my people. I will not let me with a few dollars a_chepen. You get not a penny more. What do you want more? We have three red dogs shot. Unleashed an incident so the company sends a governor. Winnetou challenge to a fight ... then his country being annexed and we can sell for a lot of money. And do not forget that there are many costly oil is in the ground. That man is peace more dear than an angel. I want the whole amount. Then gotta come with ieb better. Maybe I have something better for someone who pays better. Good. That had also been possible. He talk too much. It must seem an accident. Winnetou and Old Shatterhand are by the governor. They drive to White Bu_el. The Chic Aria's get more land as they maintain the peace. Keep me informed. Gomez ... as Winnetou and Wifte Bumel agree ... can we the land of the Apache the oil and forget. Plus our advance to the pioneers. The governor is apparently fond that Winnetou ... as long as he remains ... alive. That you wanted to say? Gomez? Outside the city lies a quarry. That's right. Well? Can not an unfortunate accident happen? Everything is possible. Winnetou and Old Shafterhand come along. Maybe the tomorrow planned explosion off prematurely. Above. Back.

I take his horse and his cabinet back. Would the chief of the Apache Old and Shafterhand know ... what this car is it? The Chic Aria are a nation of brave warriors. A nation that has weapons and warriors, no one to fear. Not the renegade Apache, nor the greedy whites .... that we want to deprive our country. Now I give the floor to Winnetou, chief of the Apache. The word of the Apache is not treacherous. Winnetou has come as a friend. See the course of the sun. It seems each year down on another world. Only he will live that does not against the change of times. Wifte Bumel, listen to my brother Old Shafterhand. The face appeared to speak. The white father in Washington is ready to give you more land. He sees too few have datjullie received.

Winnetou know that his death is near. That is impossible. My brother is mistaken. Definitely. No one can provide for his death. -Winnetou not mistaken. His soul will soon enter the eternal hunting grounds. Once we die and then our soul to the afterlife. But there is still a long time lucky VOOf Us. Manitou is great and Winnetou's life is in his hand. Quick Panther was killed. I've seen it myself. He came back with the horses he had stolen. I've seen how a warrior attacked him from an ambush. It was an Apache, the chief of the Mescalero's. Quick Panther venNondde the forehead of his attacker. You see the wound? When tripped Panther fast on a tree root. He stoofte the knife to the haft in his heart. He has murdered your son. -That is a lie. A common lie. I could not intervene, but gave my men warrant him the only afte cutting. Unfortunately he ontkwam, but his knife stabbed in the chest of the dead. Witte Bumel listening to a liar. When the sun goes down behind the mountains ... would you want that you were never born.
