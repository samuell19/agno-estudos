MY NIGHTS WITH SUSAN, OLGA, ALBERT, JULIE, PIET AND SANDRA Sandra, look! Susan! Susan! Susan! Susan! Susan? Susan? I'm Anton. I already knew you. From Barbara's stories. She's waiting for you in Menton. I came to get you. I don't know if I'll go. -Barbara's counting on you. I don't know yet. We're not in a hurry. Hi. -Hello. This is Julie. She needs a lot of sleep. This is Sandra's and Olga's room. Who's who? That's Sandra and that's Olga. We'll get him. Tonight. This is where I sleep. And that's where you sleep. Come. This is the way to the living room. Are you afraid of heights? -All the time. It's here. I can keep an eye on you from here. I have nothing to hide. What's he doing here? Anton, Julie's asking what you're doing here. I'm here to take Susan to Menton. I don't know if I'm going. -Why not? Because she doesn't want to abandon Albert, bitch. Who's Albert? Aha, who's Albert? Aha, there is Albert. Piet, Piet, crazy Piet! See my cunt, sea my teat! So that's Piet. Piet's been hanging around here for years. She likes to watch us. Just ignore her. She won't hurt anybody. Come. What's up? -Come. Sandra's been very hot all day. Her nipples are all hard. And her pussy's all wet. She's never had a man. She's always waited for you. You're a real man. I can feel it. I'm jealous of you, Sandra. I've made coffee. Had a good sleep? -Like a log. There she is again. Piet? What is she wearing? Sunglasses? What is she doing here? Piet's a darling She's part of the house. Just like Albert? Yes, Albert's part of the house too. If you want to get rid of me, you can lock me up in here. Better get in then. How long have you been living here? Since three years. -With all the others? No, they joined later. All at the same time? -No. Julie was the last one. Like a free youth hostel. They had nowhere else to go and... You were very lonely. Our princess is in a hurry. He doesn't know she hasn't had a man for three years. She's forgotten how to do it. But tonight he's yours, Olga. That bitch has a cold pussy anyway. A bit more salt. Pepper? Olga, will you help me? Onions. Anton, I didn't know you could cook as well. Will it be good? -I don't know, but it will be hot. We like hot, don't we Susan? Damn, I'll kill that bitch! Olga, stay here. Let go of me. Anton, I want to sleep with you. I can't wait any longer. I'm so jealous of Sandra. Let's go to the shed. I'm so horny. I've never had an orgasm. What would you prefer, an orgasm or these sunglasses? What's wrong with Piet? She's never done that before. -I think she was drunk. Where did she get the sunglasses and the bottle? Which bottle? -The one she threw, from the American. She knows everything. -So what? What do you mean so what? -She's completely stupid. Says who? And what about Anton? He saw everything. Anton doesn't know anything. We have to get rid of those glasses. They're driving me crazy. Don't you touch those glasses! Anton. Is that Albert's room? What is it with that Albert? Why doesn't he come out? Why don't you come in? Is there anything going on between Susan and him? If you come to me, I'll tell you everything. It's way too warm. Maybe tonight. Damn, she did it. Albert! -Yes? Your girlfriend's getting it on with Anton. What are they doing? -What do people do? Maybe they're fucking. What are you going to do about it? You should have grabbed that bitch by now. You've waited too long. Maybe he's unable. Maybe his dick's this short. Is that why you stay in there? Because your dick's so short? Albert? If you're not careful, I'll tell Susan about the sunglasses... about the car and about the American. I feel less and less like going to Menton. So you like it here? Plenty of variation. Things have changed since you're here. Make sure things don't get out of hand. What? -All those mysteries around us. Mysteries? -Albert, for instance. Albert isn't a mystery to me. -What is he then? He's the only one who means something to me in this house. Do you love him? -Yes. But not the way you mean. We spent a lot of time together in the past. When I went through a hard time, he helped me. And now I'm helping him. Is he having a hard time? He's become scared. He's afraid of everything. Except of you. -Yes, except of me. Of the other girls? -They hardly know him. And do you know Julie, Sandra and Olga? Well enough. As long as they leave Albert and me alone, they can do anything they want. What about me? -You can do anything too. As long as I leave you alone. Oh, Sandra! Anton, Anton! I've waited so long for you. -Me too. Why are you so late? -I had to wait until they were asleep. Why do we always have to wait for that? Why can't I be with you day and night? It's better like this. If you'd see me day and night, you wouldn't love me as much anymore. But I love you the way you are. You don't know what I'm like. I don't even know myself. I'll always love you. I knew it would happen tonight. The moment you arrived, I knew things would change. Remember when I showed you your room? I said I had nothing to hide. That's what I thought. But it isn't true. I bought this house 3 years ago because I was fed up with everything. Men, money... Everybody knew me. Susan, the girl with the million dollar face. But no one knew who I really was. Except Albert. He was the only one who wanted more from me than pretty pictures. He did for me what he was never able to do for himself. When I ended up here, it was too late. The first year, I was alone here. I lived like a hermit. Didn't see anyone. I thought I was going crazy. And then Albert came. He was a mess, but he was just what I needed. Finally someone who needed me. I spent an entire year with him. I had never lived that intensely before. Later, the others joined. Each with their own problems. I did everything I could for them too. My house became a youth hostel with me as Florence Nightingale. In reality, I was very selfish all that time. I thought I was sacrificing myself for them. But I needed them as much as they needed me. And then you arrived. Finally someone who didn't need a Florence Nightingale. From the moment we shook hands... I felt you looked through me. That feeling became stronger and stronger. What else could I do but surrender to you? I had almost forgotten I knew how to do it. Don't touch me. Albert, Albert. Susan has left. We want to talk. What do you want to talk about? Did you sleep well? -Why do you want to know? We're worried, Albert. Anton slept with Susan, last night. I saw them swim in the ocean nude, together. And now they went to town together. They'll stay away for a long time. Will they? -Yes, Susan's abandoning us. She'll leave with Anton soon. -She might never come back. But we can look after Albert too. What does Susan have that we don't? If you see us once, you'll forget about Susan. Sandra has a beautiful body! Indescribable! You don't need to describe her. I see you night and day. Look at the two naked devils. Don't burn your fingers, Olga. Damn, he saw everything! That's what I thought, but you never know. That's true. -Alright, I'll be off. Cup of coffee? -No, thanks, next time. Susan, I have to talk with you. -Not now, I'm going to see Albert. Can I stay with you for a while? Make yourself at home. It's true. I'm lucky to get some food. Please, I have enough on my mind. -Yes, of course, Anton. He's come to get you, hasn't he? What are you waiting for? Remember when I arrived here? It was just the two of us and I was doing very well. Did I ever abandon you? I'm doing worse and worse. I'm going crazy. You have to go away from here. Or you'll go crazy too. Go with him. I'll be alright. I'll give myself to those two girls. Here's Albert. Do with him what you want! Stop it, Albert! Did she abandon you, Anton? She can get stuffed. She doesn't know what she wants. You're not going to drown yourself, are you? That wouldn't be nice for Susan. Why does that bitch stay with Albert for so long? We can never do anything with him. Tomorrow's another day. Hey, there's Piet! Filthy thief! Piet, Piet, crazy Piet! See my cunt, see my teat! Piet has a man in her cabin. I know. He's dead. I know that too. -You know everything. Yes. Do you know who killed him? Yes. -Who? Do you really want to know? Won't you tell anyone? -No one. Susan. Hey, Anton. That feels good. Why on earth did she do this? -Out of revenge. Revenge? What do you know about Piet? I know she's hiding a corpse in her cabin. A corpse? The corpse the police man was looking for this afternoon. Let him look. Sandra and Olga have something to do with the corpse. Think about it. Goodnight. Anton saw me. What was that noise? That was Piet, in the kitchen. I'm going crazy, completely crazy! Albert, what's wrong? -How would I know? I'm crazy, I'm crazy! Can I help? -No. I thought as much. Susan doesn't need anyone. Sorry to interrupt, Susan. Look over your shoulder if you have time. Yesterday one, today two. Each day, they find a bit more. There they are again. It can't be long now. -What do they want? They've found a car and they're looking for the driver. Piet has a corpse in her cabin. -What does that have to do with it? I don't know but Sandra and Olga don't want the man to be found. Good morning. -It's almost afternoon. Good afternoon then. Albert, are you watching us? -Are you still angry? When I see you, I forget everything. I can't believe he was watching us all that time. Watching us make love must have made you horny. Of course, I'm a man. -Yes, you sound very masculine. What do you look like? Are you tall? Blond? Come and have a look. In your room? Yes. -Right now? Where's Susan? -She just left with Anton. Are you sure? -Yes, we saw them leave. Come right away then. But be quiet. Albert... Albert! Albert. You're beautiful. Why do you lock yourself up in here? Sandra, look. How on earth can you live in here? I had you to look at. You can do anything with us. Hard... harder! That's too hard! Julie, wait! That's where Piet has hidden that man. Come. -I don't want to see it. It's time you faced reality! You can't stay blind to what's happening around you. Julie! Where are you going? What's wrong? Why are you leaving? Can I do anything? Susan, all alone? -Had a fight with Anton? We've had fun, didn't we, Olga? Albert was asking for his food. -He's starving. Susan, who do you love the most? Anton or Albert? Why don't you ever sleep with Albert? It's no fun, all alone in his room. You only bring him food. That's all. And soon you'll abandon him. That's enough! What happened? What's wrong? -Why did Julie leave? Julie left? I saw her on the dyke, carrying a suitcase. Haven't you seen the mess yet? Piet has gone insane. Piet hasn't done this. She was in her cabin. Where are Sandra and Olga? -In the bathtub. What did you do to Julie? Nothing. -You're lying. Why is that room a mess? -Julie did that. You're lying too. I'm fed up with you! Out! Both of you! Hurry! That way! Outside! I never want to see you again! Excellent, I'm proud of you! -Stay out of it. You're getting better and better. Susan, sorry. Never mind. I'm confused, lately. All those problems. First with Piet. Then Olga and Sandra and now Julie left. It all began when you arrived. Better leave me alone. Albert's waiting for his food. I'm late already. Tell me everything about the American. American? What did you do to him? What would you do with an American, Sandra? If he was sweet, I'd be sweet back. And if he wasn't sweet, you'd hit his brains in with a whiskey bottle. Don't look at me like that, bitch. You were the one who had to fuck him. Anton, when will you stop playing the detective? Sorry I'm late. Albert! Anton! Albert! Come, we can't waste any time. Where are we going? -Away from here, to Menton. Piet, is that you? -What are you doing? Piet! -What is she doing? Piet, Piet, crazy Piet! See my cunt, see my teat! Piet, Piet, crazy Piet! See my cunt, see my teat! Piet!
