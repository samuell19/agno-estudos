Doesn't anything work here? I told you I wanted a driver and a car for tomorrow and tomorrow I can't go anywhere! Mom, please, speak English. Julio, guess whom I met at the airport on my way to Tel Aviv? No idea. - The daughter of your father's partner. She has an office in New York. I told her about you, about your brilliant studies. I said you'd call her. I have her card. You can call her when you want. She'll give you work. She's a fantastic girl. She's beautiful, she's friendly... and, above all, she's Jewish. Jewish? Not Christian? - Yes, Jewish. Good, very good! Hello, good afternoon. May God's peace and blessing be upon you. Who's calling? I'd like to speak to the American. Moshe ben Moshe. Understand? Understand? - Yes. Hello. Hurry up, it's closing soon. Go on! The rabbis say it isn't. Rebecca, keep out of this. It's just between her and me. Let's drink a toast. Sorry... So I want to see him. Where's the American? He isn't here. He's ill. Ill? - Where's Moshe? All right. He's ill? So is Moshe. Fine. They're both ill. Illness aside, where is he? Honestly... What is this? National Geographic or what? What? - What do you mean, what? I'm not here to talk about this. And before? - Before? Auschwitz. My parents come from Auschwitz. Mine from Palestine. No kidding! I know some Palestinians. How do you know them? - We have greenhouses. Greenhouses? We grow flowers. We rear camels, cows, goats and even donkeys. I have a donkey too, Moshe, my husband. Okay, Leila. Listen, beauty. I'm not here to argue, I don't know you. Drink your tea. Look at me for a second. You know what I'm talking about. You owe me 30,000$. I know. - So I want to speak to the American. Can I make a phone call? Thank you. Hello, Moshe. We're here. We're in the free zone. I'm with Mrs. Breitberg's daughter-in-law. I had no choice. I couldn't abandon her. It's okay. We were late. We got lost. I won't leave without the money. This time, it's the jihad. No. Everything will be fine. Don't worry. And I asked that he wait for us. He isn't here. I've noticed! Thank you. Go with her, I'll follow you. These fools set fire to the farm and the houses. What can I do? - Where is he? I don't know where he's vanished to! Hurry, save the animals! Are you happy now? Are you satisfied? Hurry! Well? Do you like it? Have you got what you wanted? What? Show some respect, will you. How do I have to tell you? He started the fire so you could light your cigarettes! I stopped working to sort out the problem with him! Things are clear with me! How can I reach your brain? What for? You wonder why? You don't understand a thing! The problem here is her! She shames our village. Show some respect! Don't make me even angrier. I can start a fire too! I can burn her! Shut up! You're going too far. You're an animal! Samir, calm down. Stop! That's an order! What's going on? What's going on? What are all these flames? No. I'm not staying here. After we left Yamit... To help in the greenhouses. "Come and see!"
