Your boss has given away his factory to you workers, What do you think of this gesture? Is the real hero of this whole thing still your boss? Well, sure! Hasn't he then stripped you of the possibilities of a future revolution? - Could be, - Is your boss' action an isolated case or part of a general trend of today? Part of a general trend, I think, Taking this action as a symbol of the new course of power, it may very well be the first contribution to the transformation of all mankind into a middle class, I don't think the middle class will manage to accomplish this Well, this seems to be the idea, though not an original one, Even if it gives away its factories, whatever the middle class does is wrong, right? I don't want to answer... But the middle class is radically changing its situation, I mean, if the middle class ends up identifying itself with mankind, it will no longer have a class struggle to overcome with the help of the army, the state or the church, Then it's bound to lose because it would lose its normal allies, It will have to face the new issues of its new state of affairs. Absolutely... Can you respond to these questions? Can you respond to these questions? Thus, God led the people through the desert,,, Pietro, why don't you put on some music? ARRIVING TOMORROW Well, are you okay now? Come, come, it was nothing. Great, Thank you, Darlings! Hello! Welcome, How are you all? - Hello, - Hello, my dear, - Hello, - Thank you, I'm sorry that this place is not an ideal accommodation, No, it's fine, It's been a real invasion, This was my room as a child, Good night. Good night. I'm sorry, I'm so sorry! I'm sorry, Look, look, here, Look! Look, look here! Lucia! - Lucia! - I'm here, Come, come, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Pietro! Pietro! Your friends are calling you, You're a real player. Ah! Finally, - These are my friends, - Hello, Hello, Lucia, Lucia! But what time is it? I don't know, What does it matter? But it's 6:00, It's 6! STORIES AND NOVELS It's about a sick man like me, "But even in this most unpleasant situation, Ivan Ilych found comfort, Gerasim would always come in to do the cleaning, He was a clean, fresh peasant lad," Thank you, What's that you're reading? "He belonged to his own life and the turn of goodness would have taken longer to recreate than a star, The loved one who came without my ever hoping he would, has not come back and never will again," I like to drive fast, Now I'll show you how to drive. Sure, I'm not a young man anymore, You're not Gerasim, You're not easy to face up to, There are two reasons why I feel obliged to talk to you, First of all, there's my personal sense of morals, and then, there's a confused feeling inside me that, perhaps... could be cleared only by talking about it. You seduced me, God, and I let myself be seduced, You have taken me by force, and you have prevailed, I have become a laughingstock every day, Yes, I heard the many slanders, terror on all sides, "You denounce him and then we'll denounce him." All my friends kept a close watch on my fall, "Maybe hey! let himself be seduced and we'll reap our vengeance on him", Angelino, Angelino, What? What'd you say? Hey, you can talk! Hey, that's really good! Good-bye, Emilia, I must leave, Tomorrow, I don't recognize myself anymore, What made me like the others has been destroyed, I was like everybody else with flaws, perhaps of my own and of my world, You've made me different, taking me out of the natural order of things, While you were near me, I did not realize it. But I understand it now that you're leaving, And the awareness of losing you has become the awareness of my being different, What will become of me from now on? The future will be like living with a self that has nothing to do with me, Will I have to reach the bottom of this difference that you've shown me, that is my real and anguished nature? But even if I don't want to? Won't all this put me against everyone and against everything? I realize now that I've never had... a real interest in anything. I don't mean in important things, but even in small, natural things, like my husband's work, my son's studies, or Odetta's cultish family life, I...nothing, I can't understand how I managed to live in such emptiness, and yet I did, If there was something, a certain instinctive love of life, it would wither like a garden that no one walks through, Actually, that void was filled with false or base values, a horrible heap of wrong ideas, Now I see it. You have filled my life with a total, real interest, So, by leaving, you're not destroying anything that was in me before, except the reputation of a chaste bourgeois housewife, Who cares? But what you, yourself, have given me instead, the love with which you filled my empty life, by leaving, you destroy it all, I've become a normal girl because of you, You've given me the right solution for my life, Before I did not know men, I was even afraid of them I only loved my father, But now, by leaving me, you're letting me plunge to even further back to where I was before, Is this what you wanted? Now the pain of losing you will cause a relapse far more dangerous than the sickness I had inside me before the brief healing you caused. Before I didn't see that sickness, but now I do, Through the love you gave me, I have become aware of my sickness, And now, how can I replace you? But maybe there is someone who can? I don't think I can live anymore, You certainly came here to destroy, The destruction you caused in me couldn't have been more complete, You've simply destroyed the idea I've always had of myself, Now I can't see anything that would give me back my identity, What would you propose? Such a scandal is like a civil death... a total loss of myself, But how can a man who is used to the idea of order, of the future, and of possession, do this? Leave it, I'll carry it. No, I'll carry it. Let's carry it together, okay? Hello, Emilia, I-Ii, Emilia, Emilia, Do you have a tape measure? Yes, certainly, miss, Miss, dinner is served, Miss... Miss Odetta... There's nothing I can do, It's outside my field, I'm sorry, Miss Odetta, Miss Odetta, Miss Odetta, come on, Miss Odetta, please, Open your hand, Come on, Miss Odetta, Open your hand, miss, Miss Odetta, Oh, what fine work! I'm a real jerk! Emilia, it's ready, - Are you hungry? - No, I won't eat, Come on, eat, It's good, You must eat something, No, no, I won't, But why? Why won't you eat, Emilia? It's good, you know, But why? Just tell us what you'd like to eat, Speak, Emilia, come on, One must try to come up with new, unrecognizable techniques that won't resemble any previous ones so, as to avoid silly ridicule, One should build one's own world that would allow no comparisons and for which there would be no previous measures of judgment which must be new, like the technique, No one must realize that the author is worthless, that he's an abnormal, inferior type, that, like a worm writhes and slithers to keep alive, No one must ever catch him being naive, Everything must appear perfect, based on rules that are unknown, and, therefore, not judgeable, Like a crazy man, yes. Like a crazy man, Glass on glass, because I'm unable to correct anything. And no one must realize this A brush stroke on one pane corrects without spoiling the one painted before on another glass pane, But nobody must believe it's the expedience of an incapable, of an impotent! Not at all, It must seem like a firm decision, resolute, high and almost domineering! No one must know that a stroke comes out well by chance, by chance and trembling, That as soon as a brush stroke comes out well, as if by miracle, it must be protected right away and sheltered as in a shrine, But no one must notice... that the artist is a poor, trembling idiot, a half-ass, who lives by chance and risk, dishonored like a child and has reduced his life to the silly melancholy of one who lives degraded by the impression of something lost forever, Blue reminds me of him But blue alone is clearly not enough, Blue is just a part, Who can grant me the right of making such a mutilation? Which ideologies are sufficient to justify it? Weren't my first insignificant attempts at portraits better? But look, Look there, what she's turned into by eating nothing but nettles, Oh, Lord, what a shame, I don't smoke, sorry, Which way back to Milan? Turn left, then straight ahead all the way, What would happen if... if I decided to strip myself of everything and give my factory to the workers? Let's go, Don't be afraid, I didn't come here to die, but to cry, and mine are not tears of pain, No, they'll be a spring, but not a spring of pain, Go now, go away, THE END
