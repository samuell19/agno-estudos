Black Sky. Emilia. Emilia Emilita, daughter. It's 7 o'clock and you have to... Good gracious! This creature is hopeless. Jesus, this girl... Daughter of my soul... Is this possible? Do you know the time? - Yes mum, 7 o'clock. - Correct 7 o'clock, and don't try to tell me you've slept... the bed is untouched. No mum. I haven't slept. I've been fixing the tights, they had awful holes. All night? I didn't think they were so big. Because since we ate at 11 o'clock I think... The novel... You know, you mustn't tire your eyes, daughter. I've read so little. It's been a few minutes to... Neither minutes nor seconds. You must take care of yourself... - The cups, mother. - Yes... It seems you've put a little malt and you know I like strong coffee. By the way, you eyes aren't up to this sort of thing anymore. You're hard at work all day to... But Emilia... Again? Yes mum. They are some letters in French Fort?n gave me to translate. Then you have to tell Fort?n this is not possible. I won't say anything. Don't tell him, but at least be paid overtime. I don't need it. If it's for Fort?n I'll do it with pleasure. - Hello Fermina - Hello Emilita Hello doesn't cost money, Emilita. Hello Fort?n, sorry but I didn't see you... I came in a hurry, you know we have to do the windows. That's why I came early. I thought this would be the best time to talk. - Are these the translations? - Yes, all of them. - What were you going to tell me? - It's true... You're great! - You probably spent the night working. - Yes, what were you going to tell me? Every last one. The irons, the technical, the tools, the machinery, I don't know how to thank you. - It doesn't matter. - So glad. What were you going to tell me? Oh yes, I had to tell you something, but wouldn't be better to meet you tonight? - What's wrong? - Nothing, you said tonight? Yes, we can go to the verbena (party). To the verbena? Me to the verbena? Why not? Wouldn't you like it? - I've never been... - Really, never? Then you'll see how we enjoy it tonight. We'll take a picture to remind us. We'll enjoy all the amusements, like the merry-go-round. We'll enjoy the Ferris Wheel, the slide... It'll be wonderful. It must be wonderful... - Where shall we meet? - Well... Outside my house. You know where I live, I saw you one day. Saturday, 5th of March, you were visiting a friend. you wore a blue suit, a tie. - Do you remember everything? - Yes, because... - What a wonderful scene! Where have I seen this before? Ahh, yes. The cinema, Romeo and Juliet. But there, the lady drank poison and the gallant drank the rest... to die beside her. Don't you drink poison, because he won't die for anyone. That's enough Lola. - You're wrong... - Sure I am... You're so blind and you can't talk to him without knowing him. Lola, you have no right... Emilia! Emilia! - Listen to me, Emilia. - What do you want? - You know... You know well enough all I've told you before is true She does, but I didn't hear it and I'd like to know. You... Emilia, Emilia! Even though you're my girlfriend you've no right to do me this. Emilia! - Hello. - One moment. - Good morning. - I don't like how this looks on the stairs. A respectable house is respectable, - and everybody has to... - I don't know anything, madam. - Aren't you being called? - No madam. - Emilia. - Very beautiful... - Good morning madam. - It's intolerable, I don't want scandals here. - Good morning madam. - Hi. What an unforgivable thing. You're right madam, in the fashion houses in Paris there aren't noises. So in this house I don't want even a whisper. In Spanish, there are no clients. In Chinese if I want, I'm the owner... ...and if anyone doesn't like it, the door is open. - You, go to fix the windows. - Yes madam. - Don't forget, eleven o'clock. - Yes The prettier the better and go to the verbena. - It's a scandal! - It's not my fault Talking to Fort?n on the stairs... - I didn't know he was here. But girl, so you... - Silence! - Yes madam. - Does the scandal go on? No madam, sorry. What a couple of girls we have! This lady is scary What happened? - Nothing, nothing has happened. - Don't lie, you seem to be in love. - In love? - Of course. - Has he proposed to you? - No, not yet. But he will. What has he told you? We have to talk, and tonight we're going to the verbena. Splendid! I'm glad, because Lola doesn't deserve Fort?n. - What more? - We'll take a photo to remember the day. Enjoy all the amusements, like the merry-go-round, the Ferris Wheel, the slide. As you see, because of the letters, the translations... Surely. The translations and you. Such a good man had to look at you. Don't you want more to eat? I'm not hungry. I shouldn't have eaten. - But daughter... - Really mum, I'm so nervous. All of this seems like a dream. - Such a beautiful day, mum. - Yes daughter. I guess I've not seen a day like today. Sure, It's a lovely day. I have not seen days so beauteous in my life. How good the air smells. Very good. In summer the air always smells like today. As it passes over the gardens... - It brings the smell of flowers. - Yes, of course. Surely it's because of the neighbor?s flowerpot As I can't see well enough, I don't know if she has geraniums. - Has she? - Yes daughter, she has. And prettier than ever. Violets, reds, pink... A lot of geraniums. There are marvelous. Tonight I'm going to wear a rose in... - Mother! The dress! - There's plenty of time. No! You have to iron it and 11 o' clock arrives so quickly. So help me god! Suppose it has a mark and we have to clean it up. - Father's uniform. - Yes daughter. - How handsome he would be. - Very. What a pity clerks don't wear uniforms! This is it! Fort?n would be splendid in a uniform. Men have to wear uniforms! Not all of them, because Fort?n... - Mum! - Emilita. Oh mother! - What's the matter? - The moths have eaten it. - Let me see it. - What for? It's no use. All the preventions haven't served. Give it to me! We can fix it with care. I'm sure we can work on it and it might look alright. Oh my God! - I can't go to the verbena. - Why not? I can fix it well enough. But it wouldn't be pretty. - You can go with this dress. - No. No, he said "The prettier the better and go to the verbena". That was because he doesn't like me so. - But with a few fixes... - No. Don't be child, you'll see how everything is going to be alright. - It seems the day is cloudy now. - Yes, a little. It's nothing. The sun will rise again. Don't you know what time it is? - I know I'm late but... - Madam is angry now. She asked for you many times, get to work... Very late. I'm going to deduct from your pay the money for this afternoon. - But, madam. - Don't complain. It's the first time I'll do this with you. I've never been late madam. I know, I do know you've never been late. So, I told you it's the first time I'll do it with you. - Madam... - That's enough! What a wonderful dress... Yes, but she's wearing it, so... Would you go to the verbena in this dress? To go to the verbena you only need a boyfriend. Yes, but he told me "the prettier the better". Men talk too much. Of course... - Luisa. What do you want? Where are you going? - To deliver. - But later, you'll come with me. - No, I'm going to the subway. Please Luisa, just a moment. No, I want to be home early. Luisa, Luisa please, it's very important to me. Ok, whatever you want. Tonight I'll sleep in the Moncloa. What's wrong? Oh, we've been walking a whole hour. Let's stop and tell me what's wrong. Wait. - Sit down. - What's up? - Give me the box. - The box? Yes, give it to me! Well, I can trust you, you're my only friend. I've done something I never imagined I would do. You know... C'mon, I'm nervous You've not got a corpse? No, it's that... I have no dress to go to the verbena, I wanted to go, and now I have one. Oh no, you're not going to touch my delivery. Not the delivery, it's that I've picked up a dress. - It's wonderful. - Of course it is. It costs 1.400 pesetas. Don't worry. Monday the dress will be fine on the hanger. - No, Luisa. - Yes, Monday it'll be fine on the hanger. - No, because I'll die. - Is that the doctor's prescription? Don't laugh at me. You've gone many times to the verbena... - A thousand times. - I've never gone - And you've had a boyfriend. - Of course. Me no. I'm always with my mother. Without enjoying anything and nobody telling me anything. And I'm in love with Fort?n since I saw him. Tonight we're going to the verbena. Maybe he doesn't love me but... ...the Ferris Wheel - Don't tell me again! You've told me this morning. Merry-go-round... Well... - Can I take it? - After all the talking... - Luisa... - Well, I think that jail isn't so bad... You can eat very well, you can write your folks and... - Good bye, dear. - Bye. Destiny... The destiny I'm going to lose Monday... You look splendid. Clothes change a person. When I see the ugly rich, she must be very poor to seem ugly. Oh my God, the cloth. - You must take good care of your friend's dress - Yes mum. I don't know how she has it, you earn so little money. Oh, eh... She's a model. She had a discount. - What a blast! - Yes, this is the best. Does she have more? No, I mean... From all of the girls. That's why I asked for this. Moreover... - It must be Fermina... - I'll go. Here you are. It's been a miracle to find it. Because Mrs. Julia has planted tomatoes instead of flowers. They smell less, but have more vitamins. Times are changing. - It's from a friend. She's rich, isn't she? A colleague of mine, she's a model. This dress only the richest or the poorest can have. The rich because they buy it. And the poor, because people give it to them. - I'm ready mum, what do you think? - Beautiful. - Do you think Fort?n...? - Yes. - What pretty music! - We're losing this music. I prefer a "chotis" with barrel organ instead of pasodobles of Chopin. - Go to sleep. - Yes, but you have to come back early. Thank you. She is so beautiful. - Will you see the girl? - Of course. - She looks perfect. - Yes, lovely. But, she scared me when she arrived in a cab. - Why? Because I've only seen two people with these clothes in 30 years as a concierge. Mr. Pepe when he had a cough while he was watching football and died. And Mercedes, the day before she married the poet. Taxis always bring misfortune here, like telegrams. - Come on in. - Yes. - Emilia! - Hello Emilia. - Good evening Fort?n. - Let's go? - Let's go. - Do you like it? - Very much. If you prefer, we'll go. - No, no. - This is the fourth round. - If only it could never end... - Happy? - Yes, I always imagined it like this. - This is wonderful! - In fact, this one is the worst. I had never been until today. I've been like Sleeping Beauty, and you the prince, who woke me up. Really? You've never been? - Yes, why should I lie? - I don't understand... My mum never leaves home since my father died 15 years ago. She says he is at home with her. - It's a bit overstated. - But... Do you think people can love less than before? Well... I.... Really... Look! - Such nice lights! - Very nice. .- Fireworks! - They look like stars. Stars... They look like stars... Today, this morning... Well... Didn't you have something to tell me? Tell you? Ah yes, later... - What are you looking at? - I don't know, you seem different. Maybe, you've never seen me. Strong! But it tastes good. Are you dizzy? Happy, nothing else. We've been lucky. We've won a precious doll. Looks like you. Yes, in those glasses. But before, not now. Now, only glasses in working hours, because she is prettier. When I am with you, there won't be glasses. Don't you think we ought to go home? No, until this closes. - How long have we been here? - 1 hour and 15 minutes. 75 minutes of happiness. I never had so many minutes. Well, till now, I hadn't. My music! - Do you know the lyrics? - No. It's very beautiful. "Because you came to me suddenly" "Because I can't throw you from my heart" "Because as a prickle you hurt me" "Because as a flower you perfume me" "Because in the night with my eyes closed" "I hear your steps that are approaching me" "Because you don't come, you're not far away, not close to me" "Because you are the reason for my existence" It must be wonderful dancing. - You've never danced? - No. If you want... - Are you a bit tipsy? - No, and it's better spinning round. - Have you seen this couple? - Yes. - We'd better go, it's getting cloudy. - Never mind. I warn you, the later we go the wetter we'll get. No, there are lots of stars. Look! - Like a waterfall of stars. - Yes, it's true. But wouldn't be better... You said before, the rockets are stars. - Yes woman, but... - It's pretty. You had something to tell me. Didn't you? Oh yes, later. I don't know what you'll say... If is like this "chotis" it will be fine. - Look! How little these people are! - Yes, so tiny. They look like ants. I've waited for you tell me something since this morning. What was it? Something very important for my future. As you've always loved me, I think this won't displease you. - No. - I said good bye to madam. - I'm going to Valencia now. - Ricardo... I'm going to a relative's factory as a partner. I owe you this, because of your translations. What do you think? Emilia... What's wrong? Are you crying? What's wrong? Nothing, nothing is wrong. It's... I've been so happy tonight. How long have we been? 1 hour 15 minutes, 2 hours yes, 2 hours... Oh Lord, 2 hours. For you nothing... ...but for me. I will not have them... Please Emilia, this must stop. People will think I hurt you. - It might have been better. - Yes, it's possible, sometimes men... - We won't meet again... - Yes, baby, but don't cry. - Tomorrow? - Ye... yes tomorrow. - Where? - Somewhere... Well, it's raining It'll be my tears... - No baby, your tears don't wet so. - Take it. - Thanks Fort?n, you're always in all. - What's that smell? - Tobacco. It must be. I've never smelled it before. We're stopping... On the other side, please. Yes, thank you. The handkerchief. - The handkerchief, handkerchief, Emilia. - Oh yes, what a head I have. The handkerchief Emilia. Don't you see I have it? Oh, yes. So I told you. Oh God, I don't understand you. Hurry! It's raining! He's right. C'mon! Let's shelter! - Wait, Emilia wait. - Ricardo... - Emilia! - Ricardo! Emilia! - Hello girl. How much do you want? - No... Oh, my glasses. Watch out, please. Be careful! Oh my God, the dress... Have you lost something girl? My glasses, but I can't find them. - Here you are. - Oh, thank you. But they're useless. There are no lenses. What do you know? Now better than ever! Sorry... Take it. What happened to you? - Thanks you. No. - So, allow me. - Are you going? - Yes. Of course, I've always thought people don't enjoy this. - The same happens to me... - No, I've been so happy. I see. - Goodnight. - Good bye. Emilia! Yes mum. It's me. Have you enjoyed yourself? I want to see you. Tell me everything! I suppose you've enjoyed it a lot. Fort?n would be delighted! Because you went as a bride. Well, brides would like to be like you. But... What are you doing daughter? Why don't you come? - Do you want me out of bed? - No mum! Well, If you're a few seconds late I'll... Emilia! - Mother. - But daughter... It's nothing... I've enjoyed it so much. Look... Look... Later, it started to rain and... I couldn't see him. Later... not to get wet. My poor little baby. I thought you were going to enjoy yourself. No, I had a great time. We went on the Merry-go-round, the dodgems and the Ferris Wheel. Plenty of lights. It was spinning... It was spinning... - Emilia! - Hi Luisa. And last night? Did you bring the dress? You really enjoyed it, didn't you? - Of course. - You don't even wear glasses. - I lost my glasses yesterday. - Say! So, it was fantastic! I've lost a fan at most. - Wait! - Leave me now. And to this all the shit of last night. Don't hold this dress! Madam I beg you, I didn't think I could. Come with me please. Yes madam, but don't shout at me please. I had to go, I had to go, do you understand? I couldn't give it up, to me it was very important. It would be better not to say anything. - But... - Shut up! Give it to me! It's dirty. But I'll pay you. You can discount it from my pay. Give it to me! - Miserable! - Madam, please! Putting this wonderful thing on his dirty skin... This wonderful... This wonderful! - This robbery! - Madam! Robbery! Madam please! I threw her out because this should be an example to all of you. I don't like having thieves in my house. I don't want to call the police, go away. Just a moment... Rosa will take her place. You don't deserve anything. Go away! Emilia, what's wrong? Emilia... Regrettable, madam, in Paris... I know, in Paris they don't give it back. Emilia, don?t cry. Please. Thank you. All of you I had to... But baby! I know I did wrong. Don't worry. Don't you see...? Ladies, you have to work here. Hurry up! Come with me, don't listen. I shouldn't have gone to the festival, but Fort?n told me... Fort?n! If you can ask madam where Fort?n is in Valencia... I have to send him some translations, and I don't know where. Never mind. I have his address. - Lola! - Yes, Castelar 20, 2nd floor. Thanks Lola, I swear it's for that. No problem. I give him to you. To me, he is no longer important after the festival. But... you know it? I don't wear glasses, but I see well enough. Please Lola! She is too good giving her Fort?n's address. Fort?n's address? No, I'm not so stupid like her. It's the address of my cousin Carlos who lives in Valencia. We're going to laugh when her letters arrive. - Emilia. - Hi, mum. Why have you come now? What happened? No... In the shop, when I gave the dress back... ...you know. The one I wore yesterday to the verbena... - ...the one I told you... - Yes, the beautiful one. - Yes, the one I told you... - The dress that Lola lent you. Yes, the same Lola... No, it wasn't Lola... Emilia! Emilia! I lied to you. It was from the store. Forgive me, but I can't avoid it. There were a lot of dresses, and I hadn't... I wanted to see Fort?n. I wanted mum, you know how I wanted. But this is robbery, Emilia. They told me so at the store. My dear Ricardo. Maybe you can imagine how sorry I am for not saying goodbye to you. but I lost you in the rain, and couldn't find you. I came back home alone and were sad because you weren't with me. but happy because I had been so very happy. The sound of the clock reminded me of the notes of "chotis" that the barrel organ played the night you met me to go to the verbena. Maybe this music has been the reason I'm writing you. Or thinking that this melody, so beloved, jump the roofs of Madrid, to go to Valencia, so luminous. Maybe you don't remember the time we enjoyed the verbena, maybe those 2 hours don't mean anything to you. For me, those 2 hours made up all my hopes and dreams. The dreams, you remember them And the hopes, we will live them again. You can't imagine, how sorry your absence makes me. I'd be so happy if you would send me a letter in which you tell me the progress you've made and promise me, even if it isn't true, that you will come back. I know it's only a dream. I know I'll never go back to the verbena. But I'll gaze at the sky every night, to see if someday the stars explode. Those stars you taught me to distinguish. And that I can?t ever forget. The first floor's got a relative staying from Cuba. I saw it in the rubbish. - Hi Fermina. - Good morning, Emilia. - Good morning. - Good morning. If you please, I'm a saleswoman from a boutique. And I wondered, if you have a job for me. Right now I haven't. - Thank you. - You're welcome, bye. - Good morning. - Good morning. - The boss of this place... - He's there. - Good morning. - Good morning. I've been saleswoman in a boutique. Do you have a job for me? Sorry miss, no job. All the places are occupied. - Thanks. - You're welcome. - Could you give me a job? - Impossible, there aren't any. No, I'm sorry, there's no job. There isn't, goodbye. - Good morning. - Good morning. - Beautiful day, madam. - Very. Letter from Emilia. Letter from Emilia. - Interesting? - Oh yes. She is so much in love. Such foolish things she says. Later we'll read it. Letter from Emilia. - What's that? - Letter from Emilia. She says every night she watches the sky to see how the stars explode. Silence! Sorry madam, I told them a French joke. Don't do it again. You know this house is absolutely moral. Two o'clock I'm meeting L?pez Veiga, a poet. We're going to reply to her with an incendiary letter. Let's see if her glasses will melt with that cheesiness. Lola! That was a Spanish joke. Hi, Don Felipe! - He is charming! - And clever but doesn't want to work. Because he is very clever... (Latin words) May I sit down? - Yes, and you can shave too. I could, but I can't now. The beautiful gesture, calling the waiter, I've almost forgotten. Let's drink! According to Horace, old Cato provoked his virtue with wine. And Stoic advised getting drunk occasionally. Plato in his laws finds drinking very useful. - Because wine... - What do you want, Don ?ngel? Marvelous question! White coffee, but double. Double, with two scones. - What do you want from me? - To write a letter. The epistolary style is my forte. - Business? - No, love. In love I'm so strong And, who is the lucky one that can read my poetry? - A woman - Oh no, no. No way. I'd resign with pleasure these scones. With displeasure... Put them down. I'd resign isn't I resign. I'd resign these scones to do this. Don't be a fool, you have to reply to this letter. My dear Ricardo... things change... Maybe you can imagine how sorry I am for not saying goodbye to you. but I lost you in the rain, and I couldn't find you. I came back home alone and were sad because you weren't with me. but happy because I had been very happy. Romantic, eh? I'd be so happy if you would send me a letter. Here you have pen and paper. - What do I say? - What can you say? - I don't know - That you are crazy for her... Enough, easy for a brain like mine. A genius can guess things. Emilia, my love. Our separation has been necessary... for the breaking out during this time, of the warm love we had. - Immense. - Quiet. I don't know what cowardice prevented me telling you before. Maybe, the respect of my sincere affection. Again we are facing the lonely immensity... There are no more scones. Must I repeat? Now I'll order more. You're great. Isn't he? Very! If I didn't know it, I would be proud. Let's continue. Or maybe, awaiting better luck. To offer it as a security... ...of our love. Today, my situation has no doubt in my future. I just want you to tell me... Mum... You hear, mum? - Yes, go on daughter. - But don't you see... Go on daughter... What else? I just want you to tell me... If you are ready to live this future together. Until God separates us Don't cry mum. To join us again in eternity. In eternity... Daughter, when a man writes like this, you can't doubt. I think we have to bless those translations. Yes. Such beautiful music! It reminds me of the Ferris Wheel. Although, no need to remember. Just close my eyes to be happy. That night, you found it excessive my mother cried over the memory of my father. And I thought that was so little, because I knew I could remember your memory of love. But also, the hope you could love me forever. It's cheesy. - ...you could love me forever. - What do you think? I believe... - You don't believe anything. Tell her you'll come to ask her on the thirtieth. - But I can't do this... - The thirtieth! Against my opinion and because I'm salaried and I can't refuse. A revolution of poets would stop this. Emilia, darling. An imbalance has emerged. In my soul are no ideas of love. You'll tell her that? I mean the bar. When there are scones there's no coffee. When there's coffee there aren't scones. All this makes me nervous. - I'll order more, now write. - Ok. - Another double. - And more scones! Maybe later there won't be... Why more time to enjoy... - Scone... - Go on. Why more time to enjoy... our love? On the thirtieth I'll be in Madrid to ask for your hand. On the thirtieth I'll be in Madrid to ask for your hand. - Nothing happened today? - Nothing. Well, wonderful news. The thirtieth, he's asking me for Emilia's hand. You shouldn't have told her Happiness kills less than sorrow. Because it is rarer. Instead of six drops, eight. Start now. I'll come back tomorrow. You should keep quiet. This heart shouldn't run. - Yes doctor. - Bye. - How is she? - Bad. - But can you do anything? - We've done it, Emilia. We've been years doing so. That heart doesn't reply. If your father were alive, I would tell him. So, I have to tell you. In a few days... Many? - No, I'm sorry, Emilia - Thanks, I know... - Let me know if anything happens. - Yes. Emilia! I'm coming! - What does Don Julio say? - You're well. - Fort?n comes on the thirtieth? - Yes. If only he would come sooner. - Why? - Nothing daughter, don't worry. Because I haven't enough patience. If you ask him to come 8 or 10 days sooner... ...or better 6. I could leave you... - Don't think that. - Everything has its end. And mine is closer. I'm going to write him. Drink this. If he came, I could rest easy. He'll come. - Until tomorrow. - Bye. Dear Fort?n, I've received your letter, we read it 20 times and we don't believe it. But there is something I have to ask you. My mother is dying. My mother is dying. Gee! Go on. Before she dies, she wants to hear the promise of our wedding. The doctor thinks she can't last till the 30th. Would you come a few days sooner for her... - I think we've been foolish. - Foolish? Tell her you'll come in four days and you wait for her at the station. - I'll await the moment she'll be searching. - No! What do you say? I'm a poet and I only write love letters. Not this. And for this I pay you in coffee? - Here you are. - I do what I must. She wanted to steal Fort?n from me. Little things. She went with him to the verbena and she's no good... She stole a dress in order for Fort?n to see her. - Such is love. - Don't be fool, I'll give you 5 "duros". - Go away Lola... - 10 "duros" - Don't tempt me. - 20 "duros", 25, 30... - Pepe! - What do you want from Pepe? - What do you want? - Pepe, throw me out of here. - How I... - Throw me out! - Well, Get out Don ?ngel. - You see, I can't be here, bye. ?ngel, ?ngel! ?ngel... is the first time I use my name correctly. - Is she going to come? - Yes. You are messing up the hall. - I haven't got an ashtray - Smoke in the street. - I'd lose the smoke. - At the corner there's a bar. Here she is. - Hello Emilita. - What's wrong? That man. Appearances are deceptive. - Good afternoon. - I don't know you. No, you don't know me, I'm L?pez Veiga, a poet. I'd like to talk to you. - Sorry I'm late, my mother... - Yes, your mother is ill. So ill, I know. I wanted to tell you something related to Fort?n. - He's coming? - It's something important. Very important. If it is so important, come with me. Listen... I prefer in the street. - Please... - Well. I've been waiting for his letter, do you think he'll come tomorrow? - No. So, did he tell you something? Well, really... I haven't seen Fort?n in my life. I don't understand. Let me explain to you. Some days ago, a friend of yours came to the bar I usually use. She ask me to write letters and... And you know... I'm a poet and... The coffee, buns... And later, more letters and more coffee, buns... Well, I'm stupid. I thought I was a great speaker... Take it, it's yours, where you tell Fort?n that... There is something I have to ask of you. My mother is dying and before... Before she dies, she wants to hear the promise of our wedding. The doctor thinks she can't last till the 30th. Would you come a few days sooner... - Go away - I swear it was out of hunger. I told you I'm poet. And starvation and poems... A poet doesn't mean a scoundrel. Go away! - I refused, I told Lola... - Go away! But listen to me! Listen to me! Sorry. - Are you sleeping mother? - No. On the contrary. I've been preparing all your things. - How have you spent this afternoon? - Very distracted, you know. I've been looking for things for you daughter. Time flies. March is very close... Has Fort?n answered? No. What a pity! Don Julio came this morning. We talked not as doctor and patient but as friends. He believes... not for nothing. He believes Fort?n should come sooner. If he came in 3 or 4 days... - That's what he said? - Yes. - Fort?n will arrive tomorrow. - Emilia! You can be sure. He is coming. (Reading) - Good evening. - Good evening. Sorry, for receiving you like this. I was reading Euripides. I don't care about those tragedies. - I have enough with my own. - I told you I'm sorry. - Thanks, but it's too late - I asked your pardon before. Never. So, I don't understand why you are here. I haven't come to see you, but to see Fort?n. Fort?n? I don't know him, I told you on the stairs. I've only written some letters, I don't know him. Some love letters without importance to me. They told me it was a joke, and it was until I saw you. Fort?n is in Valencia, write him if you want. It's no use, for me you are Fort?n. Don't be silly, I'm L?pez Veiga, a poet... You're Fort?n! The same Fort?n of your letters, your creation. Fort?n that my mother waits for, in order to die. No, no, impossible. What you're asking is impossible. You are going to ask for my hand tomorrow. No. - My mother is dying. - I read it but it's not my fault. My mother is dying and I want her to die peacefully. She waits for Fort?n, the same Fort?n you created with your lies. - You'll be Fort?n! - That can't be. - You will be! - But I... - You will be! I understand, but you... - You will be! - Well, wait. Ok, I'll be Fort?n. - 12 o'clock at my house. - As you wish. - Take it. - Excuse me, I don't take money... I know, this is too much money to buy you. This is for your clothes. At least you must be neat. - 12 o'clock. - 12 o'clock. - Emilia. - I'm coming! - Am I pretty? - You're splendid. - Do you think Fort?n will like me? - Fort?n has to like me, not you. - Don't be so foolish. - I guess... Don't talk anymore. And take these drops. Later Fort?n will come and you may forget. - It tastes horrible. - But they're good for you. Take it. Isn't he rather late? He said 12 o'clock. He is a good businessman. Here he is! C'mon girl! If you'd seen how nervous I was when your father came to my house. - Good morning! - Good morning... Speak to me with love. - Good morning, my dear. - Emilia! - Is it Fort?n? - Yes mother. - Have you had a good trip? - Of course. - I'm going, it's crazy. - You stay. Please come in for a drink. Come in! - Is this for me? - No. It's for Fort?n. Oh, yes, I thought so. My mother is hopeful. Take it easy with her. What you ask me is too much. I don't know why I accepted. I don't think I can go through with this falsehood. - You caused it. - Someone else could have done it. And this "him" would be here like you. What would have happened if I'd said "no"? With this bag I'd go to your home. I'd introduce this. And If you had said "no"... I didn't find anything better. Are we going? The suit cost me 300 pesetas, it's too big for me. Shoes 50, shirt, tie and flowers. And a white coffee too. - I don't want this money. - For tomorrow's flowers. But tomorrow I have to come? - Emilia. - We're coming. Every day while she lives, from 12 to 2, here. - You don't understand, I beg you... - Let's go. Be gentle with her. Remember the style of your letters. Remember it... And you must come, always. Although, there won't be many days left. Come on! Fort?n! Come here son, I want to see you closer. I thought I wouldn't see you. I really wanted. Me too, Madame . Therefore, when Emilia asked me to come sooner... - ...I came quickly. - Yes. Madame, may I have the honor to ask for your daughter's hand... ...promising you, she'll always be happy. My love for her is as strong, as yours. And we'll be married. Our factories are splendid, splendid. - And what do you do? - Well... Everything, we make, cans, boats, locomotives... Everything! - Goodness! Locomotives and boats... - Yes, yes... Well, of course... they are toys. Carnations! Would you allow me to pick up one? I'm sorry beheading it, but... - Would you close the balcony? - Yes ma'am. - Are you alright? - Yes, Fort?n, thank you. - Have you gone to the optician? - Yes, I had an eye test. They told me to go to the doctor. This may be serious. Our house has just begun to be built. It'll be wonderful. - Will it have garden? - Of course. And we'll plant... - And we'll plant rice. - Rice? Well, and other things too. And flowers too, but... ...as we'll live in Valencia, rice is essential to make paella. - Very good, son. - It will be a Virgilian life. ... Beatrice and Dante. Romeo and Juliet, Polifemo and Galatea. What poetic things you say, Ricardo. I'm a poet, ma'am. Well, poet... In fact, it's as if I was... Precisely, I have a splendid book here. From L?pez Veiga, L?pez Veiga ma'am. An unknown genius. And some day he'll have a lot of statues. Listen, listen. - What's wrong? - I can't. I can't. My eyes... Open your eyes. Let's see. Get up. Sit down here. Look ahead. You can rest. Despite coming to this charity center, your livelihood is good? Yes, doctor. - It's good. - You mean... I must say. Tomorrow we'll make up your prescription glasses, but I believe it will be no use... - You won't see much more. - Never? Increasingly, you won't be able to work. You can't fatigue your eyes. You must conserve what you have now. Do you think if I didn't work, If I didn't fatigue my eyes... - Even so. - Even so, in the future... Nevertheless, bit by bit, bit by tiny bit, that day will come. Thank you, doctor. Don't wait for me tomorrow, I won't come. - Do you want one? - No, thanks. Pretty! - Fermina. - Yes, daughter. It's the worst. No, nobody can pass. I know I'm worthless, but if you need me I'll always be here. Thank you. I don't want thieves in my house. This is robbery. Bit by bit, but that day will come. I have the honor to ask your daughter's hand. I don't want thieves in my house. This is robbery. Bit by bit, but that day will come. Good bye, mother. Good bye. Where are you going, Emilia? Emilia! Emilia! Stay here! Where are you going, Emilia? Lord... I don't know how I could dare as much. My sorrows were many. But not yours, and you didn't rebel against God's will. I didn't forget the sky's not black for people who trust in you. I didn't forget You gave us life. And You are the only one who can decide. Forgive me, Lord! Give me peace, Lord. Banish from my mind forever... all the visions of death. Give me peace, Lord. Peace. The End.
