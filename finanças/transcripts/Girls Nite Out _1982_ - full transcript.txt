You'd like it better if I ran around and made an asshole of myself in a bear suit? You know, that's an idea for you, pryor. Hey, man. Pryor's going to take over my bear suit. Lay off, Benson, I've had enough of your bullshit! I told you, it's nothin'. God, I wish you believed that, cos it was nothin'. - She's just a girl. - Yeah, that's easy for you to say. - You think I've never been dumped before? - Not that I've noticed, no. Well, I have, plenty of times. I just don't go around telling everybody. What am I supposed to do? I couldn't think of nothin' else out there tonight. Damn! You've gotta pull yourself together, man. - Sure, but what if pryor finds out? - So, he'll find out. I know, I know. I guess I'll have to break it to him easy. I don't really want to hurt him. Well... then, why? I just couldn't help myself! Benson is just too much! He kept it up forever! It hurts when I sit down! - God, Sheila, he's your cousin! - Second cousin. Down to action! Let's bring on the main attraction. Oh, my little super-stud! You gonna leave some of the chickadees for the rest of the lowlifes? - If you ask politely, yes. - Oh! I mean, it's been Teddy for two years. Don't you even get curious about how it is with somebody else? I'll bet Teddy does. Teddy knows my limit. He knows just how much I'll put up with. Hey, coach! Great game, guys. I didn't wanna coach at notre dame anyway! What the hell! I'll send my wife down there. She'll do a betterjob moving the guys. Now, hey, enjoy yourselves tonight. It was a great win. But don't wear yourselves out helping the sorority ladies with the scavenger hunt. Ok! Hold it! By the way, 11 o'clock sharp, practice tomorrow. - No baloney, be there. - Ok. What a drag! Practice? Now, that is depressing. What does he mean about helping the sorority girls out? We can if we want, can't we? Bostwick, sometimes, you know, you're really a nerd. Aargh!

Well, then, I guess there must be nothing wrong. You know, Mike, sometimes you can get very weird. And you're getting worse lately. You don't understand me, do you? That's ok. I'm used to being misunderstood. I can tell when something's bugging you. - All right, what about Benson? - I don't know what you're talking about. Come on! Don't bullshit me! You know what I'm talking about. - Hey, hey, we've got company. - Oh. You know you're gonna drive Barney crazy. Oh, that's not a drive, that's a putt. Besides, she loves it! I'll tell y'all one thing. She's a hell of a lot better than that old witch we had last year. - Damn! - You mean Mrs. Gates? No, no, he means Mrs. Bates. - The woman in psycho, remember? - No. Hey, maniac, come on, show Lynn your Mrs. Bates impression. Oh, come on! - All right, catch this. - Ok. Mrs. Bates? Mrs. Bates?

Hey, hey, hey, gang. - Hey, thank you, Barney. - Great service! What's the damage? Your money's no good here. This one's on Mac. - Mac the cop bought it? - Yeah.

Hey, can she be topless? - Of course. - Woo! - I'll see you later. - Come on, have another drink. One more. A little more, a little more. What a pig! Ooh, look at that! Watch out for the boogieman.

He is the result of one of my bad sex experiments. What will modern science think of next? Woo! Eat her up, baby! You're bad! You gone bad! Heel! Heel! Woah! Bad boy. Come on! Walked in and I spied a girl named Sheila. - I walked up and said, "can I feel ya?" - Oh, baby! She said with a stink, "Teddy, get me a drink." And I said, "I don't think so. I'll see ya." - Can I go get you a drink? - Teddy, you can get me more than a drink. Oh, I'll go see what they have at the hors d'oeuvres bar. Oh, please do. - Bye. - Bye.

Well, I never could compete with Jack Daniels, basketball and Teddy ratliff. Sorry, Pete. He-he-he! Tell these little mucous membranes about Dickie Cavanaugh! Uh, I want you to meet Dickie Cavanaugh. In many ways, he was a lot like you boys. He was young, semi-literate and he was an American. Then one night, they took old Dickie out into the woods. Dickie came back. But his mind just kinda stayed out there. They had to take him up to the loony bin in ol' Weston hill. He's been there ever since, just screamin' and a-hollerin' all night long. Think about it, fellas. C'mon, hagan, let's go drink some women. Oh, drink women! Bye, fellas. Bye. - Did you hear that? - Do you think it's true? - It's a bunch of shit! - What do you know? My brother went here six years ago and they tried to dump the same stuff on him. - Oh, yeah? - Really? He said... he said this guy, Dickie Cavanaugh, did flip out. Yeah? But it had nothing to do with the bear ritual. - He got hung up on some cheerleader. - Gotta have a little bit... - And then he killed her... - Killed her? - When she dumped him for another guy. - Oh, shit. He did it right in the middle of the scavenger hunt. - Phew! - Come here. See that girl there? Patty macvey. She was Mac's daughter. - Who? - Mr. Macvey. He's head of campus security that's always poking his nose around. - Oh, yeah, yeah. - I'm gonna check out the action. - Yeah, good luck. - Catch you later. - Ralph, I never saw you dance before. - Ha, it's the beer. - You want some cherry lip balm? - Nah. Hey, Ralph, go like that. - What? - Go like that. Go like that. Just a second, you got something right... - Ugh. - Ralph, are you ok? Ralph! That was like real insane. It was a riot! I wish I'd had my camera with me, I would have taken a photo. Stick it right up on the w... who is it? I like it! I've been waiting for... Benson! God! Gross me out! Cool yourjets! God! Excuse me, Teddy. - Listen, can I ask you a question? - Sure, kid. What is it? Well, we were just wondering if you could tell us anything about Dickie Cavanaugh. - Who? - Dickie Cavanaugh. He murdered that girl a long time ago and got put away for it. Least, that's the way I heard it. She dumped him or something. Look, it didn't have anything to do with the bear in hell week, did it? Nah, kid, just relax. Dickie was crazy anyway. Excuse me, I've got some business to take care of. Ooh! Excuse me! - Hey, nice party, huh? - Oh, lots of people. I'm, uh... Teddy ratliff. I'm captain of the basketball team. Hi, I'm dawn Sorenson. And I couldn't care less. Ok, score one for you. - Sorry. - But, uh... don't you feel it in the air? It's destiny. We were meant to meet. Uh... I don't think so. If you don't believe me, you can ask him. - Who's him? - That's my boyfriend. His name is bud Remington. I'm sure you've heard of his family. Oh, yeah. The New York remingtons. They own company after company and, uh... From the looks of him, one of them must be a distillery. - Cheap shot. - Score one. Even. - You got it. - Ok. C'mon! Your turn, jock-pits! Ha-ha! Jock-pits opens for one shirt. Oh, god, dancer. You skunk! You're wearing a bra! - And I thought you were liberated. - Well, tootsie. - I'd never get across campus without it. - Well, what if we lose everything? What do we do next? Oh, god! - Oh, no! - What if we lose everything? What do we do next? Well, I plead the fifth. I refuse to answer on the grounds I may inseminate myself. J“ do you believe in magic in a young girl's heart...? J“ easy. Pryor's right over there. I don't want to make him look foolish. - When are you gonna tell him? - Tonight. I wanna break it to him real easy. - Just don't be easy with me. - Mm-mm. Benson. Psst, psst. Lose some of the hair. J“ your feet start tapping and you can't seem to find j“ how you got there so you just blow your mind... j“ So, um, what are you and little Iggy doing tomorrow night? Iggy tomorrow night? We're gonna be listening for them clues tomorrow night. Oh, well, that's just great because I'm gonna be in one of my club meetings and I was wondering if you might be able to assist me, the two of you. Are you kidding? Me and Iggy, we can help you out! - Well, that would be great. - We could sniff out the clues what is this stuff with Benson? You come here with me? You get it on with him? You don't even talk to me? Please don't start now. Listen to me. I'm not gonna let that creep take you away from me. - You got that? - Reel it in, pryor. You don't own me! Really? We'll see. Get off of me! Get off of me! You little bitch. You just take what you can get. All of you, you're nothing but a bunch of whores. I won't forget this. Are you all right? He always was a little strange. - He's a lunatic. - No, no, no. This is different. I think you should look behind your shoulder. - Come on, lover boy. - Lynn! Have you met my cousin? Dawn. Dawn Sorenson. - Come on. Let's go. Come on, lover boy! - My cousin dawn Sorenson? Photo time! Get up! Get hot! Get the sand out of your ass! Get wasted! Get tasted! Get up and smoke some grass! If you don't get pregnant or end up in the slammer, you can join our sorority, and be in kappa gamma! Till tomorrow, or should I say later today, this is old Charlie kaiser wrapping it up. Now all you good people catch some sleep for the hunt tonight. Be mellow. Be happy. Get high. J“ hot town, summer in the city back of my neck gettin' dirty and gritty j“ been down, isn't it a pity? Doesn't seem to be a shadow in the city j“ all around, people looking half dead j“ walking on the sidewalk, hotter than a match head J“ but at night it's a different world... Yeah? Who is it? J“ in the summer, in the city... Wait a sec. Who is it? How are ya? J“ but at night it's a different world j“ go out and find a girl come on, come on... Sorry, but I need this more than you do. J“ that the days can't be like the nights j“ in the summer, in the city j“ in the summer, in the city... j“ You know, you almost broke my neck with that damn leash tonight. Well, try harder next time. "Meet my cousin!" What crap? My head's killing me already. Oh, gimme a break. How come you act like such an ass when you're drunk? Basically, I'm a very anal person. You see, it all stems from childhood repressions. Right, that gives you a reason to screw around? No. I do that to, uh... Keep you on your toes. Hey. I think you're reallyjealous. Insufled. If you're gonna do something like that, don't do it right in front of me, ok? Mm, c'mon, you know it doesn't mean anything to me. Yeah, well, it made me look like a fool! Especially in front of someone like dawn Sorenson. What do you mean? I have feelings, too, ok? C'mon, look... I was a little drunk and I felt sorry for her, you know, being with that creep, bud Remington. If you're gonna feel sorry for someone, feel sorry for Mike pryor. Why should I? The guy's nuts! - That speech tonight. - "You're all a bunch of whores." That only proved it. Hey, I think I heard something outside. What? - Oh! - Oh, god! I feel so much better! - You are a gross man! - Mm, smell that baby! - That's a winner! - You're disgusting! What do I see in you? Who else could give you odorama? Jerk! Hey, I think I hear something out there. - Please, not again. - No, no. Shh! Really. Really. Just... See? I told you. What do you think it is? I don't know. Probablyjust a raccoon or something. - I'll go outside and... - Don't go out there. Hey! You think a raccoon can defeat your great ratliff? No way! Anyway... you don't want them... To stick that garbage... All over... your front lawn... Cos then everyone will find out about us. - I'll be right back. - You'd better be. Be careful. Miaow! - Oh, Lynn! - It's me. It's me, I'm sorry. Are you ok? What the hell are you...? I missed you. Yeah, you missed me. I almost got a heart attack out here. - You ok? - Ok, the sound's nothing. - No raccoon. Let's go back in. - Let's go back in. Definitely. Right away. - You almost scared the hell outta me. - I'm sorry. Hello. You're Mike pryor, aren't you? Right. I hear you caused quite a stir last night. Well, I really don't think it's any of your business. Anything or anybody that causes a commotion around this campus is my business. - It's all bullshit. - What's the matter with you? Where do you come off talking like that, huh? Why don't you go hand out parking tickets and leave me alone? - Stick to something you know about! - Something I know about? Listen... My daughter was about your age. Then she met a guy like you. Now she's dead. Well, I'm sorry, but that doesn't change the way I feel. Or anything else. - They always do. - Oh, yeah, fast. Very fast. Shh! - What? - Nothing! Do you remember two years ago when one of the hidden things - was coach kimble's jockstrap? - Oh, yes! And Sally got caught in his house trying to find it! Do you think she was lying when she said he wanted her to put it on? If that dirty old man said that to me, I'd end what's left of his sex life real quick! Speaking of sex, what's Teddy doing tonight? I don't know. Said something about going to the hunt with maniac. - He's been giving me problems lately. - He doesn't deserve you, Lynn. You're too nice. He just takes advantage of it. - Such are the ways of men! - Some men. If I were you, I'd keep an eye on him. Hey, Teddy's all right. Just needs a little time to grow up. There's only one part of Teddy ratliff that's going to grow, and we all know what part that is! Sheila! Finally! That burger's naked. Nutter! Hey, what's with maniac, huh? Ugh. Leslie dumped on him. And now she's taken up with the president of delta fi. You know, it's not enough that the school tries to screw you. Everybody else has to screw around with everybody else. Hm, watch out. You're gonna turn into a cynic! Maybe. Sometimes I think Lynn's the only loyal person left. Ah, I know what you mean, I know. I see it all the time. Girls jumping from one bed to another bed, they drive guys crazy. Lynn is a really nice girl. There's not too many of 'em around anymore. Thank god for that! - See ya later, sweetheart! - Get outta here! Say, Mac, how do you want to handle security on the scavenger hunt? No problem. Take the night off. I'll prowl the campus myself. It'll be quiet. Ok, see you Monday. Thanks. This is wdbx, the scavenger hunt station on old gold weekend. 'Now for some more music. 'Here comes Tommy James & the shondells with some "hanky panky".

J“ didn't want to have to do it j“ didn't want to have to break your heart j“ didn't want to have to do it J“ I kept a-hoping from the very start j” but you kept on a-tryin' j“ and I knew that you'd end up a-cryin' j“ and I knew I didn't want to have to do it j“ at all j“ didn't want to have to do it j“ didn't want to have to be the one to say it j“ didn't want to have to do it j“ I kept a-hoping there'd be something to delay it again j“ yeah, but then j“ no, I didn't want to have to be the one to say "the end" j“ was a time I thought our love could fly j“ and never, never fall... Will you please hand me a towel? J“ to be close to each other at all... j“ um, you don't have to get dressed on my account. You take a lot for granted. You know if I were to scream, you would be in a lot of trouble. You wouldn't do that. - I'm hardly worth a scream. - What do you think you're doing here? Well, I didn't want to stand you up on our first date. Oh, our first date. I almost forgot. So, how's our baseball hero tonight? Basketball, and who said I was a hero? As I recall, you did. At the party? Oh. Well, we gonna spend the rest of the evening in the bathroom? - It's a really nice place you have here. - Thank you. Um... mayl... Offer you a drink? Sure, but may I offer you some wine? Uh... sure. Yeah, wine is great for those special occasions. To a wonderful evening. Now, that remains to be seen, doesn't it? Listen up, I've had a couple of calls complaining the clues are too hard. Sorry, but it wouldn't be any fun if the clues are easy. Remember, a new clue coming up soon. In the meantime, let's warm up this place with "summer in the city" by the lovin' spoonful. - Wdbx, kaiser here. - 'Kathy's number two. 'Who'll be number three?' j“ been down, isn't it a pity, doesn't seem to be a shadow in the city... This is the kaiser speaking. Ready for the next hunt clue? Kaiser, kaiser. I want it. I want it. I want it. I need it, I need it, I need it. Ok, this priceless item is long and it's soft and longer when it's hard. My god! That's what I want. That's what I want. All right! Keep tight! Who knows what you'll sight? It's now time for clue number eight and here it is. "I'm on a beach and I'm a groovy king. "'Find the right fork and you can make me sing. Is there a beach around here anywhere? I can't think of any. The only place I can think of is Swanson's pond, if you call that place a beach. Um... I don't think that's what he had in mind. I don't know, then. I'll check it out anyway. I'll check out the lodge while I'm there, too. Security, macvey. - Hi, this is Charlie kaiser over at wdbx. - 'Yeah?' this may be nothing, but I'm getting some really strange calls here at the station. What do you mean strange? Somebody's been calling up and saying some pretty off-the-wall things. - Man or woman? - That's part of it. I can't tell. Is it some kind ofjoke? - You know what it means? - 'No idea. It's probably nothing.' but you know, there's something really creepy about it. You did right to call. If you figure out what it means or if you're getting more calls like that, get me here quick. - 'You think something's wrong?' - Oh, I'm sure it's just some crank. You seem to bring 'em out, kaiser. No insult meant. None taken, Mac. I know my following. Benson! I underestimated you. Could this be love? Well, if you want me, you'll have to come and get me. Come on! You must be getting hungry now, Benson. Oh, Benson, Benson bear. The body that won't stop! He's even got a mind. Come and get it, Benson. I'm waiting for you, Benson. Oh, come on, Benson. I know you're faster than that. Oh, my god! Benson! - Benson! - Bitch! Bitch! You whore! Dawn, you're the most beautiful girl I've ever seen. I just hope that you like me a little bit, that's all. I like you a lot. You wouldn't be here if I didn't. Security, macvey. 'Patty macvey wasn't a nice girl. 'Now Patty macvey is dead.' who the hell is this? - 'Dickie Cavanaugh.' - Dickie Cavanaugh, you bastard! - You're locked away. - 'Am I, macvey? 'Am I?' - 'Weston hill sanitarium.' - Macvey, DeWitt campus security. - Get me Jack Quinn fast. - 'I don't know if he's here.' well find out, damn it. Oh, god! - Come on! - I'm not seriously up for this. Come on, it's gonna be great. You're gonna love this. - Hey, Trish. - What? I hear the ghost of James durham! Will you knock it off? - Oh, if my dad could see me now. - Yeah, fabulous! Leslie, right there. You see right there? I don't know, can you make out what it is? No, it's too high. Wish you hadn't dumped maniac, we could use him right now. Oh, come on, Trish, I don't want to talk about Pete. It still hurts. Ok. Come on, let's go, shrimp. I'll give you a boost. Why me? I always have to do this stuff? Because you're wearing sneakers and I'm wearing boots. - And you just had a manicure! - Shut up! Get up there! One, two... - What is it? - A record. Carole king "tapestry" album. - Hey, this has got to be it. - Sure! "A groovy king on a beach." - A beech tree? - Oh, right. Did you hear that? - No, I didn't hear anything. - Leslie, I swear I heard... Trish, come on. There's nobody here. Come down and let's get the next clue. - All right. - Got it? Come on, let's see what kaiser's got to say. We're on a roll now. So, here's clue 14. "I keep things hot. I keep things cold. "I'm hiding where a bat might be bowled." That's it. "Keep things hot, keep things cold. I'm hiding where a bat might be bowled." - That's clever. - Where a bat might be bowled? At a baseball game. - In a baseball field? - No, isn't that too easy? I guess so. Oh, god! You don't think it's the kind of bat that flies, do you? That's what I was thinking, but where would you find a "bold" bat? I got it! In a belfry! You know, bats in a belfry. Well, that's terrific, Trish, but there's no belfry around here. - Can you think of anything else? - In the chapel. I mean, there's not a belfry but there is an attic, that's pretty close. - You think that's it? - God, I don't know! I'll tell you what, I'll go check the chapel, you check the baseball field. - I'll meet you back here in half an hour. - All right. - Take the album. - Make it half an hour. - It's getting scary out here. - Will you relax? - I'll see you later. - Bye. What the hell is wrong with you guys over there? You running some kind of a country club? 'Hey, Mac, cool down. What's the trouble?' the trouble is, Quinn, that one of your precious nutsos, Dickie Cavanaugh to be exact, just called me on the telephone. - Don't you lock your people up at night? - 'You said Dickie Cavanaugh? - 'Are you sure?' - Sure, I'm sure. If you can't keep that bastard under lock and key, I'll come over and do it myself. 'Hold on, Mac. Dickie Cavanaugh checked out of here two days ago. - 'Couldn't have been him.' - What do you mean checked out? How? 'Mac, Dickie Cavanaugh killed himself. He hung himself in his cell.' hung himself? - You sure? - 'Are you kidding? 'I cut him down myself.' - are you sure he's dead? - 'Christ, I hope so! 'His sister picked up the body to Bury it two days ago. I turned it over to her. 'He was sure dead then.' yeah. Well, I'm sorry for bothering you. Must have got the name wrong. - Get back to sleep, Jack. - 'You sure there's nothing I can do?' no, nothing. I'll sort this out myself. I'll talk to you later. Huh! "Where a bat might be bold"! Hey, Benson, are you nuts? You scared me half to death. Hello, Leslie. We're gonna have a good time tonight. Come on, Benson, a joke's a joke. Don't be afraid, Leslie. Hey, Benson. Benson! Hey, what the hell time is it? Three. - Oh, Jesus, I've gotta get out of here. - You have another appointment? No, but I have to go. I gather this means you're not staying for breakfast. Never eat it. Besides, I really don't think it would be a good idea for either of us. I've really had a terrific time. It was wonderful, I mean. - I mean... - You mean you had a terrific time. But now guilt is setting in and you want to get out of here. - You're right. - Don't worry about it, Teddy. It's ok. I'd really like to see you again. I mean, we could be friends. All four of us? I mean, your Lynn, my bud. It's not gonna work. Don't worry about it. You know, you're... You're really some girl. "Some woman" is the way I'd put it! Now, get out of here. Go on! Go on. - Get out of here... champ. - Ok. - And lock the door behind you, would you? - All right. Jesus! Hey, Benson. Where's Sheila? What's the matter? She dumped you for somebody else already? Wdbx all night, Charlie kaiser. 'The twins are together again.' Wow! - 'She's dead! The blood!' - What? 'She's dead! The blood! It's awful!' - who is this? - 'Lynn! It's Lynn. Oh, my god!' - Lynn, I can't understand. - 'Oh, my god. - 'She's dead. Leslie's dead.' - Lynn, stay right where you are. 'Oh, god!' - 'Wdbx, kaiser.' - Charlie, this is Mac. - 'Hey, Mac. Troubles?' - Just listen. I want you to get on right now and announce that the scavenger hunt is over. - 'Over? What's happening?' - I'll explain later. Just get on now and tell everyone to go inside and get back to their rooms. Try not to panic anyone, but get them back to their rooms. - 'But, Mac...' - Now, Charlie. Do it now. Sorry, folks, but the scavenger hunt is over. 'Please go back to your rooms. 'Please, everyone, go back to your rooms.' This is insanity! Detective greenspan, nothing like this ever happened here before. I think if we just remain calm and keep everybody in hand, we'll get to the bottom of this. Meanwhile, those reporters will have to be told something. God, the publicity! - What will the trustees say? - Can't be helped, Dean kemper. Why don't you issue some kind of statement about a continuing investigation? Tell them you'll have a press conference soon as you get some news. Would you handle that, Mac? I just can't deal with all this. Yes, sir. Let's get away from these people. - Leslie was senator Peterson's daughter? - Yes, everybody knows that. I had to make sure, but do you think the murder had anything to do - with his political affiliation? - No, that's ridiculous. I don't want to talk to you anymore. Robert, take me home! Come on. Look, look, you don't have to get your hands... - What happened? - I just want to get my car. Yeah, yeah. Listen, get a couple more guys up here for crowd control, huh? It's completely out of control here. Yeah, put him on. What? Oh, no. I'll tell him. Hey, listen. If anything else comes up, get back to me, and get back to me quick. They just found another one down by the pond. - Same as the other? - I'm afraid so. Oh, Christ! What a mess! We're going to have to restrict everyone to campus. What about the parents? They're calling. - They want to take their children home. - No one leaves. You'll never be able to quarantine this whole place. Everybody knows what's going on. There's too much movement. The campus is too spread out. Look, just question the people that you feel are important. Let the rest of them go, if they want to. Ok, I'll buy that. We'll need a couple of rooms for questioning. You can use my office at the administration building. - Mac, see what you can do down there? - Yes, sir. I'll talk to you later. Right this way, gentlemen. Mac's told us it was you who had discovered Leslie Peterson's body. I heard a clue that I thought I knew the answer to, so I asked my girlfriend Claudia to cover for me. And so I went to the chapel. 'When I got to the top of the stairs...' Oh, god! I mean, there she was and... Is there anything else that you can think of? Something you might have seen or something you've heard? I saw Benson in his costume before I walked into the chapel. - Who's Benson? What costume? - Michael Benson. He's our team mascot. Our mascot's a bear, so he was wearing a bear costume. What kind of guy is this Michael Benson? He's a nice guy. No, he wouldn't do anything like this. You're probably right, but we will have to question him anyway. - You know where he lives? - He lives in Laurel hall. I don't know the room number, but you could look it up in the campus directory. Thank you, miss Connors. You may go. Thank you. I hope you find this lunatic soon. We will. You be careful. Thank you, I will. - Charlie, this is Mac. - 'Yeah?' uh... just a couple of questions, and I want to keep this between you and me. Those calls, the strange ones that you got last night, the voice? 'I told you, Mac, I couldn't tell anything about it. 'It was a really strange sound. Sort of a whisper.' I know, but can you remember anything special about the whisper? - Anything? - 'Besides being weird, nothing. 'But I've got it on the delay tape, if you want to hear it for yourself.' you're telling me you got the whole thing on tape? 'We always use a delay tape on a request line.' Charlie, will you get those tapes to me right away? 'Sure, thing, Mac.' - Where were you last night? - I don't know. I was out. We already know that so tell us, who were you with? All right. I went downtown. And I picked up one of those women on chapel street. - And I took her to the midtown motel. - What name did you register under? John clary. Do you have a girlfriend? - Nope. - Why are you lying? We know Leslie Peterson was your girlfriend. Leslie Peterson dropped me. Is that what bothered you, that she left you? Sure it bothered me. Wouldn't it bother you? I know what y'all are thinking. You're thinking that she quit on me and I killed her. Jesus Christ, I'm not crazy! You said Mike pryor and Sheila Robinson had an argument at the party. - Yeah, yeah, she hit him. - Do you have any idea what this was over? Well, I think Sheila and Benson were fooling around and pryor found out about it. You see, I overheard something pryor said. He said... "'That creep's not gonna take you away from me." 'And then Sheila said to him, "you don't own me." 'Then he grabbed her, ripped her dress. 'That's when she hit him. 'And then he just started hollering at the top of his lungs.' he called all the girls whores, and he just stormed out. And why do you think this has anything to do with Benson? Well, I'll tell you, because right after that, Benson went over to Sheila. 'And Sheila put her arms around him. 'And Benson started smooching her.' oh, well, Trisha saw it, too. You know, lots of people saw it and, uh... Oh, earlier at the party, you wanna know? I overheard something Benson said. He said, "when are you gonna tell him?" Talking about pryor. And Sheila said, "I wanna break it to him easy." But what's all this got to do with the murders, anyway? Oh, my god! I hope you don't think pryor had anything to do with this. You were dating her, weren't you? Dating her? I was in love with her. We went out together for over two years! - Then she dumped me for some ass! - What was his name? What difference does it make what his name is now? But it does matter. What was his name? Benson, Michael Benson. - Why did she break up with you? - I don't know. Come on, you went out with her for over two years and you don't know why she dumped you? No, I don't know. I guess I wasn't good enough for her. You guys don't think I had anything to do with this, do you? Hello? Yeah. Thanks, Tom. Pryor, wait outside. Do we have something to eat? No. All I got is peanut butter. But no jelly. If you eat it... You'll never get your mouth open again. - Can't we get anything else? - Not unless we go out. We can't do that. You, uh... wanna fool around? I've been listening to this. Oh, come on. I really don't feel like it. - What you do that for you? - Did you feel like it last night? - What? - I said did you feel like it last night? - What are you talking about? - I'm talking about last night. - Did you feel like fooling around then? - No, I didn't. I was studying. - That's all you were doing? - What are you trying to say? I'm not trying to say anything, just asking you a question. What's the matter, bud? I want to know who you were with last night. I wasn't with anybody! - Don't lie to me. - I'm not lying! - God, you're hurting me. - You are lying. Somebody saw Teddy ratliff leaving your room at three in the morning. - I asked around. I know it's true. - It's not true. It's a lie! What's the truth? The truth is that I love you! - You're lying. - I am not lying! Oh, god! Get out! - No! - Take your stuff and get out! - Look, it's over, it's over. - Bud! - Why are you doing this to me? - Get out of here! Damn you! Bud? Yeah, Joe? Yeah. Thanks, Joe. Joe said they found Michael Benson. Stabbed to death in his room. Let's get pryor back in here. 'Dickie is out, and janey is number one!' 'Kathy's number two. Who'll be number three?' 'the twins are together again.' No! No! Hey. - You have to eat something. - I just don't feel like it. I can't stop thinking about this. - Yeah, I know. - I mean, who would want to hurt them? Who could be doing this? Look, er... maybe it'd be better if I took you home. - Just till the police find out something. - No. I want stay here with you, Teddy, please? Honey, I just want to stay here with you. Ok. Ok. Oh, please! Please, Teddy! I have to come over. - Dawn, where are you? - I'm at the student union. - I could be over in a second. - Is she alone? - Where's bud? - Oh, god! I don't know what's happening! 'Just calm down and stay right there. I'll be right over.' Teddy, I don't wanna be here. I wanna come over right now. I don't wanna be here! Dawn, what the hell's going on?' answer me!' 'If you want her, come and get her.' who the hell is this? Where's dawn? Dawn? - What? What's happening? - Ok... You call Mac. Lock the door behind me. Don't let anybody in except maniac. - No, I'm going with you. - No! Now, you just stay here. There's been enough shit going on as it is. "Dickie and I had lunch at the union. "Again. I'm getting tired of just seeing Dickie. "I'm going to date other people." Date other people. "Her boyfriend, Richard Cavanaugh, "was brought to police headquarters for questioning. "He was accompanied by his twin sister..." Twin? "Accompanied by his twin sister, Katie Cavanaugh." Twin sister? God... almighty. She is Katie Cavanaugh. Please, Mac, answer. Please, god! Dawn? Dawn! Dawn! - Teddy! - Jesus! Easy, easy, easy. - I... I heard... - Jesus! Who the hell did this? I'm alright. I don't wanna... - I don't wanna be alone. - I won't be a minute. Aargh! Katie? Katie Cavanaugh? - I'm... not... - Katie. I'm Dickie. Dickie Cavanaugh! I'm Dickie! And they're all bad! That's why I had to kill them. That's why I had to kill your Patty. I thought she was good. But she wasn't. She was bad like the rest of 'em! You know I killed her! Katie, Dickie is dead. You have to accept that. He hung himself. He's gone. Forever. Why, Mac, what are you talking about? Dickie's not dead. I just brought him home two days ago from the hospital myself. Dickie is dead. Didn't I, Dickie? Didn't I?
