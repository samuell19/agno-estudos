Let's go home Z?, let's go. That's enough! New Christ preaches revolution. Saint or demon? 7 leagues carrying a cross and wants an agrarian reform. It's against the exploration of the men by the men. Guys, come here. Let's help this guy in the church of Saint Barbara. - And what about our Capoeira? - We'll do it there. Here, the whole story of The Black Emerald Since her childhood until her death. Do you want one? I was thinking. You fight with the priest could give a good book. Do you want it? I can write. - No, I don't want. - Why? It would be nice. - No. - But everyone here reads them, including the priest. My friend, i'm the most famous poet of Bahia. If I say that I'm going to write your story. I'm sure that the priest will open the door, and carries the cross himself. What is needed for that? Well, the paper is expensive, the printing too. I don't have money. You will regret, it would help with your situation. - I don't want. - Ok. It's your choice. The literature is the one who's going to lose with this. -Hey, go and make a man's job! - Let's go them. - Even though today we can't take a hard job. - Today we're going to have Capoeira? Yes! Later we will. The priest won't let the man enter? This priest it's strange. The other day he forbid me to sell my books anywhere near the church. - Why? - Let's go inside and I'll tell you. - He said that the story of Emerald was obscene. - Two drinks. And from that time, the girls of the church don't talk to me, like if I was the devil. I don't like this priest, but thanks to him, today it's crowded here, and they took my picture. New Christ preaches revolution. Saint or demon? Give me one. New Christ preaches revolution. Saint or demon? Little boy. - 7 leagues carrying a cross. - For the agrarian reform. - Against the exploration of the men by the men. - But for the priest, he is satan disguised. He is a communist. Don't you read the newspaper? The police is sleeping? Come! Quick! For the priest, he is satan in a disguise. After all, who is Donkey Ze? A mystique or an agitator? Did you see? Things are getting ugly. New Christ preaches revolution. - Z?, I don't like it. - Neither do I. Saint Barbara must be punishing me, because I promised so little. - I'm being punished as well. - Saint Barbara is tempting me so I give up. - I almost fell a while ago. - When? When that woman said all that. I kept quiet so I wouldn't kill her. I have to keep my promise. - All of this is a test. - Sure it is. And this is the only explanation for everything that happened today. Saint Barbara used me to put you in a temptation. I fell a strange force pushing me there. But if it's Saint Barbara, what could I do? You should resist the temptation. Like me. It's different, she was testing you, not me. And if she's a saint and can make miracles. She can make me do things like I did. She can put the devil in my body, like she did. - But this is not going to happen anymore. - We'll talk about this later. On our way home. New Christ preaches revolution. New Christ preaches revolution. New Christ preaches revolution. Saint or demon? Our Father, Who art in heaven, Hallowed be Thy Name. Thy Kingdom come. Thy Will be done, on earth as it is in Heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen. New Christ preaches revolution. This case needs a deeper study, but we don't have a lot of information. In a first view, this poor man.... We can't say that he is only a poor man. Everything leads us to believe the he wants a mess. And that he have only bad intentions. Forgive me, but the matter now is not the man, but the church. The church's position. I think that the priest Olavo is doing the right thing. Even though, I think he's right. For the people he seems unfair and cruel. The church looks unpleasant. Sometimes, it takes courage to assume unpleasant attitudes. The Monsignor wants us to intefer.... Not at all. But we have to find a solution to improve our image. Without giving up our faith. I agree. It would be ridiculous if we treat his men like the witches of the middle age. Yes, those were other times. Even though, those were other times. The church don't allow other beliefs to enter here. Of course. In that case, we have to be severe. - Without a doubt. - I suggest that one of us go there and solve this case. I think that I have the solution. -Hello Handsome, what's the matter? - You came fast. Blondie, two drinks. What do you want? If it's about you going back to the police... - It's not that. I'm ok. - Take care, we have your file. I believe, but you're very lazy. Look at that. In my times this man would be in jail already. And you expelled me. - Who's that? - Don't you read the newspaper? - If i were you, I'd lock him for a few days - I have to investigate first. - Lock him, now! - But why? He isn't doing anything. Come with me, he'll say a story about a donkey. But don't believe him. Blondie! My friend, wants to talk to you. Wants to help. Help? Everyone wants to help. Everyone. - You have very dangerous ideas. - Dangerous? - I'm just saying my friend. - Friend? I see that I have a lot of friends. Each one trying to help on their own way. - You're a rebel. - I wasn't. But i'm becoming one. That's why you're here since very early. I don't leave here until everyone understand me. It must be a way, it must be. I want to throw a bomb in there. Father! Father! Father, I walked 7 leagues to get here. God is my witness. I did not eat today. One day, two days, a month. I'll die of starvation here. I need you to hear me. What do you want yelling like this? Disrespect the house of God? No Father. I want to remember that i'm here with my cross. I see. And that heresy shows how far you are from the church. But if is like that, God will punish me. And is not your fault. It's my fault. I'm a priest. I have to accomplish God's will. - You're making me so unhappy. - No. I'm helping you. I'm not allowing you to lose yourself in the darkness of witchcraft. No Father, I just wanted... I've been the whole day studying this case. I read books and I came to a conclusion. It's that donkey, he is satan. Just satan could make one do the path of Christ look so ridiculous. No Father. No. - Why not? - Because I know him, he's a good man. Lucifer was also an angel. But I know his followers. Even when they disguise themselves in the sheep's clothing. Even when they're behind the cross of Christ. This cross that you want to destroy. - But you will not destroy it!! - The Monsignor is here. Let him pass. - Monsignor. - I know, i'm dealing with your case. - Good morning Father. - Good morning. - The Archbishop must have sent him. - For sure the Archbishop isn't happy with the priest. Good for him They will say to the priest to open the door. Go get your cross, you will enter. - I told you that I?as? would help you. - I knew that Saint Barbara wouldn't abandon me. If he enters, will be bad for my store. We want you to think better about this case. Think in the political side of this case. I confess that I wouldn't never think about that. I've been thinking about the religious point of view. It's almost impossible to separate this two things. If your saying. If you take responsability for this decision. I open the door and let him enter. No, we can't do that in a such simple way. We can give a proof of flexibility, and solve the matter without losing our prestige. Honestly, i'd like to find this way. And we have to do it. What we can't do is leave the church empty. And everyone outside with him. I bet 100 that the priest will let him enter in the church with cross and everything. He will not. Witchcraft is witchcraft. And a church is a church. - But the saint is the same. - It is, but the priest have to defend his business. - And what you think? - I think he will enter, but tomorrow. First, the priest will humiliate him. And then, he will be affraid of Saint Barbara, and will open the door. The archbishop sent me here to give a proof of the tolerance of the church. With those who lost their and are not following the holy path. But I'm catholic, I don't understand what you say, but I want you to understand that I'm a catholic. Ok, we'll give you a opportunity. If you're a catholic, stop what your doing. Because your being inspired by the devil. And then, come back to the church. - What? - Give up on your promise, and admit that.. It was made for the devil. Throw away this cross, and come here to ask God for his forgiveness. - Do you think I should do that? - It's the only way for you to save yourself. The church gives us priests, the power to change a promise for other. Z?, maybe this is better. Rosa, if I do that, i'll be breaking my promise, to I?as?, Saint Barbara, whatever. With my authority, I release you from this promise. Come and make another one. He's giving you a proof of tolerance. Now it's up to you. You have to choose between the tolerance of the church, and your own stubbornnes. You release me? But I didn't promise anything to you. It was for Saint Barbara. And if I go back to my farm and find that my donkey is dead? It's your decision... I can't. I can't do that. I can't risk it's life. Quiet. That's why you believe in the force of the devil, and not in the force of God. - Because everything you do, is with the force of devil. - Goodbye Father Olavo. - I can't do anything. - Monsignor. Let me explain. My brothers. No one can accuse us of intolerance. Because false prophets and false christs will appear. - And they will try to deceive you. - I don't want to deceive nobody. - You will. And everyone would follow you. - I don't want that. But they would. Like they are doing now. Without knowing that you're satan. Father, I can't take it anymore. For Saint Barbara, for satan. I will enter!!!! Close the door! Here is the proof. A catholic don't do that. Officer, arrest this man. I can't do that. -What are you waiting for? - Wait a minute. Who's that? Police? Did you report him? In a while you'll be free of that idiot. - You shouldn' have done that. - It's for your own good. For our good. - No. Not like that. - It's done. Please, give a word for our newspaper. Good afternoon. The channel 5 is in front of the church of Saint Barbara. To describe this scene. Let's interview Z?. Have you ever done a miracle? Leave him alone. - Just a word. - Leave him alone, I told you. It's impossible to describe what's happening in here. He's dying, save him. It's my son, please save him. - I can't, I can't. - Put your hands on his forehead. I don't have any power. #CAPOEIRA# (The mix of fighting and dancing) - Don't you want to eat, my son? -No. -Little girl, don't you want? - No. Tomorrow you will enter. I will write the story of this priest. I know some secret things. And we can lie too. And we will se if he opens or not. Eat, it's free. If you promise to stay here, I promise to bring you food and drinks, for free. I don't care. Please. I don't want. - And you? - No, thanks. - What's the matter? - I want to go home. - Alone? - No. - I thought you were tired of me. - I'm tired of this bullshit. Leave that cross, and let's go home, before it's too late. - What are you affraid of? - Everything. - You're affraid of yourself. - It's not me who's in danger, it's you. Good girl. But she's married with everyone. - I need to talk with her. - Why? That fight wasn't enough? But I need Z?, I need. - Blondie, did you see Handsome? - He was here earlier. - I know, that's why i'm asking. - Ask her. Maybe she knows. She plays a saint. But she isn't. I need to talk to Handsome, where he is? You fucking bitch. You're want my husband and come asking me about him? I don't need him. I just want to avoid a disgrace. If you want that. Leave him alone. - Where does he live? - With me. You're lying, I know that he lives in a hotel. So go there, and you will see what will happen to you. - Shut up, I'm not affraid of you. - I'm not aff.... Have you lost your mind? Fighting with this bitch? You faggot. Your wife is searching for other man and you keep with this stupid cross. This is part of the promise? Asshole! Z?!! That's the problem with women. Soon i'll write "Blondie is affraid of a knife" - Tonight we'll go away. - Let's go now. Let's wait until the end of Saint Barbara's day. - Maybe it will be too late. - Why? To go back, listen to me, we should go home right now. Stop it! That's a tribute from our customers. And after you enter the church, you will go on a parade in this truck. And then, the governor will meet you. -Mister... - Don't worry, you just have to say 1 or 2 words. Please, leave us alone. We're going home. No no, the newspaper spent the money already. It's very easy to carry a cross through 7 leagues. But a newspaper it's much harder to make. Screw you. We just want to help. They help to fuck our life. - Where are you going Rosa? - I'll be right back. - Where are you going? - In the hotel, i forgot my tissue there. - Leave it, i'll buy you another. - Why spend money, Z?? I like that one. Don't give up mister. Today is I?as? day. And on the witchcraft house, she is possessing the horses right now. Go there and you'll see. Let's stop here. Otherwise it will be a long way back. - You're going back? - Of course. I just wanna know what they're going to do with him. - This is with the police. - Police? They're going to arrest him? - They think that your husband is a dangerous man. - It's your fault. - The newspaper said that. - But you could help him. Please, help him. Please. - No one enters here. - Why? - We're the police, that's why. - I'm a journalist, I have the right. - Police is here because of him. - I told you that you'd fuck his life. News is news. - Go home, you're going to be arrested - The police just arrived, go home. - I didn't kill, didn't steal. - I'm just saying, with the police, the best thing is to run away. - Go, we'll hide the cross. - And tonight, he'll take it to I?as?. Z?! Z?! The police is here. Let's go. Go home, my son. - Let's go, Z?. - Saint Barbara left me, Rosa. Abandon the promise, she doesn't want you to fulfil this. Now I have to fulfil, even if isn't for her. Just to be in peace with myself. Let's go Z?. - That's him. - Your papers. - Papers? - ID. Mister, i'm here to keep a promise. Saint Barbara knows me. I don't need an ID. - Keep a promise? Do you think we're idiots? - Now he will talk about the donkey. He will talk about that in the station. Let's go. Follow me. - I can't. I can't leave here. - Why? - The promise, officer. - Nobody talked to you. - The priest said that he threatened to enter in the church. - I've heard he saying that he was going to throw a bomb. A bomb? I want you to explain all of this. Let's go to the station. - Let's go. - Let go of me. - Are you going to fight? - If he fights, it will be worse. You're wrong, I'm a good man, I'm here just to keep a promise. The priest can say that to you. - It's a lie. - You can't say that is a lie. He made a promise inspired by satan. He had all the time to regret. God is my witness that I tried to help him. But he doesn't want help. And that's his problem. - I won't go to the jail. I did nothing wrong. - So, you have no reason to react. Let's go. Arrest him. - Don't do that, my friend. - No, Z?. I won't leave here. Only dead. I swear for Saint Barbara. You're not arresting anyone. - Z?. - Don't come in here, Rosa. Be careful priest. Z?!!!!!! - Holy Mother. - Get out. - I want to bless him. - Why? He isn't the devil? Go. Quick. The End
