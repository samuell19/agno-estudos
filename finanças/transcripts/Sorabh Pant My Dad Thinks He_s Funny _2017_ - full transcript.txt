Thank you so much ladies and gentlemen for coming out tonight... How are you guys doing? Come on! This is fun man, this is nice... I like how this whole thing feels like a red light area right now... But today it's an inspirational story, okay? This story today is an inspirational one... It's about how my wife and me had sex... And, nine months later something came out... And it was all because of me, thank you so much... I, I, Thank you, thank you so much... Thank you, I really appreciate it... Like a man's contribution to actually making a baby is so limited, right? You just go like... Enjoy your mayonnaise. I'll see you in 9 months. So today's show is all about babies and all about fatherhood and stuff like that... And I see a lot of young people in the crowd here, You're like: "Who gives a shit?" I don't either, I didn't even want to have a baby... And, then my wife was like divorce and... So I'm like, "I love babies!" So let's take a little bit of a survey, right? Before we begin the show... How many people here want to have a baby at some stage? How many people want to have a baby? Yeah, you too? You too sir as well? Are you married? To this lady here? "Yeah." I love this because you raised your hand and she didn't... You're like "Let's do it!" And then she's like "Dream on!" Now I just want to quickly tell you how babies are made... So my wife and me were trying to have a baby for about a year and I have no problem with trying... I love trying, okay? Trying is amazing... I will try four times a night if you want me to. Okay, once. And... and my wife and me were trying for a kid for about a year And you know when we just went to The doctor to check up if everything was fine. The doctor told us to take a bunch of tests... which is the doctor's way of saying "Does your stuff even work or no?" And as a part of this whole thing this doctor basically Told me to go and take a sperm sample test, okay? Which by the way is the best prescription any doctor can ever give you... It's just a medical professional saying: "Jack off!" It's awesome! It's amazing! And so okay, has any man had to go for a semen test ever, anyone? No? This guy is pointing to his friend... It's always his friend, it's never you na? Did you sir? No. How do you know by the way is the question? Were you guys trying with each other? Because I know what the medical problem here is... No I mean like proper sperm test not like amateur level like you guys, like I mean professional Level. And by the way, you think this is a great thing, right? Like it's just you go there and do this thing and whatever, it's not! It's very disgusting, it's a very disgusting thing because you go to the counter and as soon as you declare you're coming that, people start judging you already. Like I went to the counter and I was like "Madam, I need a little..." And she's like... And it's very intimidating because right up top she comes and she hands me this cup this big What? I'm like madam can I come back next week? This is, even then I won't be able to fill it up by myself... I'll need help from the neighbor "Mr. Gupta, please help me out, please." "Yes, give me some sugar as well" It's damn creepy, man. And even movies mislead you man, movies mislead you into thinking that this thing is like a fun thing, right? In movies what they always do is like whenever you're doing this test is always like magazines to put you in the mood... I went to this place and the only magazine there was Tinkle Digest No. 427 This is not going to put anyone in the mood. Nobody goes like "Oh yeah, Suppandi!" "Yeah, Suppandi!" You know what they say about a man with a big chin. And personally I prefer Champak. And it's very creepy man, it's a very creepy thing, and the weird thing is that I'm in this room doing this disgusting act by myself and in the middle of me doing this whole thing, there's suddenly a knock on the door like loudly "Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!" And I'm like... Mom? No, I'm just reading Tinkle, mummy... And what happened apparently is... these guys were trying to repair the door... While I was inside doing that... Do you want to test the door before I do that? This is the shittiest knock-knock joke in history. "Knock! Knock! Who's there?" "Pant's Dick! Pant's Dick - who?" What the fuck are you talking about? So anyway, I have a kid and as it turned out everything was fine. We were all ready to go and my wife was pregnant... Thank you so much... I'm very talented. I love my son a lot... The problem is my son's mother who also happens to be my wife. Coincidence? Dude, my wife is insane... Like my wife is so goddamn paranoid, right? And my wife is paranoid because she genuinely believes that... Google is a doctor. My wife believes anything Google says. My wife came to me once, she had a pimple on her face and she's like "I have skin cancer" Listen if a pimple gave you skin cancer, Om Puri's entire career is chemotherapy. What are you talking about? So stupid. And if you go on Google anything gives you cancer by the way, I checked up. Just go to Google and check this up at some stage... I googled fart and cancer... You get it. If you have too much Rice & Beans, you have cancer. It's fucking, any bullshit And paranoia by the way, my wife... If you're like paranoid as a person, when you have a kid, that makes you 50 times more paranoid about that child and what my wife does not realize is paranoia is now an industry. Like it's lucrative to make people paranoid. Like people get worked up and shit and then they buy stuff to become less paranoid, right? And she keeps doing all this weird stuff for my son like, you know like expression of a paranoia. First of all you know that weird thing like... What is that thing? You rub on your hands to clean the... What? Sanitizer! Everyone said sanitizer this guy said Massage Oil... Are you from Kerala or something? I'm a Malayali, coconut oil means cleansing. Massage Oil... Yeah, I mean if you use massage oil on the right places. It does cleanse you. So my wife keeps using - anything she's like "sanitizer". Like fucking anything, sanitizer near my son and for babies who what you have is, you have these mosquito patches. I'm sure some of you guys like these mosquito patches on the babies. Now most parents put like one or two. My wife puts like 89. My son enters the park and all the mosquitoes are like "Fuck, The Terminator has entered." And the other day my wife in her state of paranoia, she bought my son, she bought him a mug for 1,200 Rupees. And I'm like "What is so special about this mug?" And she's like "Listen, this is a very special mug." "You know what happens with this mug." "It's a special mug." "When you pour water on the child while bathing them, no?" "The water doesn't go into their eyes." You can do that with a normal mug also. Just don't go like "Drink this! Happy Holi to you!" Don't throw it into his eyes. The thing about having a kid like, one of the reasons why I like my wife is, you have to you need a person to create a baby. And my wife, we have a lot of love in the relationship, is what we say to people. My wife and me we had a love marriage. As in: I loved her. And she loved marriage. Ummm... Some people are like, "It's true for us also, son." We had a love marriage and the thing is like I thought it's a really cool thing to be proud of and my parents also had a love marriage which is like a far more, because my parents had a love marriage in the 1970's. Which is far more hard-core. And they were dating each other for four years before they got married. That's fucking amazing man. By the 70's standards they were hard-core. They were like the Hrithik and Kangana of their era. Without the cheating part. But my dad is a very sweet man. The problem is he was very shy of my mom. So he wanted to propose to my mom but he's very shy of like women in general. So what my dad did was, he asked for my mom's hand in marriage by asking a friend to ask her. Like my dad did a proposal by proxy... One uncle went down on one knee and was like "Sujata!" "Will you make me the happiest man on Earth." "And marry that guy over there." "He's hiding over there. Please marry him." Umm... so yeah I mean that's essentially how my parents created me and then whatever. But there's also like, the next step is like you go through the entire 9 months of insanity and then you come to the point when the child birth actually happens, OK? But like movies mislead you, right? Movies mislead you. Like every time you see a movie, I'm not talking about the childbirth itself, the actual build up is crazy in the movies. In the movies it's always like "Oh my God my water is broken." And then Narmada dam protest started like "Please do not allow this water to come here." And Arundhati Roy is like "I will not allow this water, how dare you?" And then what happens after this whole thing is this explosion and then Sebastian Vettel takes you to the car and drives you straight to the hospital. And you reach the hospital and the doctor is like "Oh my God, Aamir Khan! Get me the vacuum cleaner." Chaos like that... Is there any gynaec here by the way? I really respect you guys, I mean all day you have to look into Mahakali Caves. Like "Hello! Helloo! Hellooo!" It's a tough job, guys. No. But, again as I said the delivery itself is chaos. But the actual build up to it is relaxed. Like what happened with my wife and me was that my wife was 9 months pregnant at that time and was due any second. And at 10:30 pm my wife is like "Oh you know, I think something's coming." And I'm like "What are the options?" So I tell my wife and like "You know what?" "Let's go to the hospital and if it's what we think it is." "Great." "If not we'll just go get ice-cream." And my wife is absolutely fine with that. Like that's our attitude. We are okay with a baby... or butterscotch. We have no problems and we get to the hospital all relaxed and shit and we go and the doctor's like "Yes, you guys are having a baby." And my wife is genuinely disappointed. She looks at me and she's like "You mean no ice cream?" I'm like let's have priorities. I will get you a Magnum later. Let's have priorities. So we anyway take my wife in for the entire this thing. I was there for the delivery. And again what happens is like in the movies they always mislead you. Especially like Hollywood movies mislead you to think that men are really calming influences. Right? Like every time you are watching a Hollywood movie like Hugh Grant is always there in the movie... Some British character going like... "Oh my honey, cuddle poodle dumper." "My softy cone." "My Brexit." "Ooohhh!" And the chick has calmed down. Dude I went to my wife once during her contraction and I'm like "My little..." "Go to the corner!" "You bastard. You made this happen." And I'm sitting in the corner playing Fruit Ninja... Like, "Bring juice for the Prince!" Or whatever. So the whole delivery thing. The women are like fucking champions and warriors of this shit We'll come to that in a bit. So anyway, my wife is going through contractions for about 6 hours and then comes the most crucial juncture where the doctor comes like "Hey, it's time for the delivery." "And, we got to take her to the delivery room." He asked me a very crucial question. "Hey, the delivery is about to happen." "Do you want to watch it from the Front?" "Or, do you want to watch it from the Back?" And I'm like "Bro..." "I've seen Game of Thrones." "I've seen the Red Wedding, you ain't got shit on me." "I will see it from the front." Do not watch it from the front. Don't watch it! The stuff that happens. First of all is watching something that you've had so much fun with... Just being torn apart. It is like what Americans felt during 9/11. It is insane! And it's all crazy man, anyway again this whole thing happens and contraction etc etc... And then the doctor a wonderful gynaec. A Parsi gentleman and he basically pulled out my son and he handed him to me and I'm like "No, it's okay. You keep him." "You are Parsi, you need them more than I do." "You can name him whatever Xerxes or Cyrus..." "or Xenophobia, whatever." Dude, women are fucking champions... My wife went through this entire thing like a 9 hour process. She went through the entire thing without epidurals which reduces the pain. She had a natural childbirth. Fucking insane dude... Men could never pull this shit off. I could personally never pull this shit off. Like if somebody told me, like "Hey, here's what's gonna happen." "Here's how this is gonna go down." "You're gonna have a living being inside you for 9 months, okay?" "You're gonna go through contractions for 9 hours." "And, then your dick will expand." And my wife is like "Oh my Magnum!" And then a living thing is gonna come out of you and I'm like fuck that. I'm getting a Labrador. Balls! I'll name him Xenophobia. When my son was born there were two names doing the rounds. I wanted to call him Arjun. And my wife wanted to call him Vikramaditya. And my son's name is Vikramaditya... Because he came out of my wife. And Finders Keepers... But here's what happens man, these days people are going crazy with the kind of names they have for the kids, right? And I met a friend of mine and she was like "This is my daughter, Pooja." And I'm like thank God. What a normal name. "Hey, Pooja" and she's like "Not Pooja..." "It's Puzeayy!" "It's P, U, E, Z, A, M, FFFFF." It's name for the Mandarin goddess for the African goddess... of farting on people's faces. Whatever bullshit. What crap? Like how do to talk to this poor girl? "Hey, Puezamfff." "Your parents are Poonanies." "Did you know that about yourself?" "Did you know that?" But people have crazy names... Does anyone whose friends have weird names here? Who raised their hands? Your friend's name is Silver Shah? What a fucking Gujarati cliché. So clichéd. That's like a Marwari called Diamond. It's so fucking stupid. Yeah? Mercury More? And for your temperature you just shove him up your ass? 98.3 Mercury. And here's the thing in India, we don't even settle on the names... The names are not where we stop. Our most important thing is not even the name. The pet name is even more important. Like till I was 12, I swear to you. I genuinely didn't know that I had a name. Because everybody used to keep calling me Chikoo (Sapodilla) Everyone used to call me Chikoo and was anyone called Chikoo here at some stage? Admit it. Yeah, ma'am. You were called Chikoo? What's your name? Swati, why did they call you Chikoo? Did anyone ever tell you? No idea? I asked my mom the same question "Hey, why did you call me Chikoo?" "Because when you were born no?" "You were round and brown." "Mom, that's racist towards fruits..." "And me." My son is white and round, should I call him Custard apple? What the fuck is happening? I'm just glad my parents didn't name me after something else that's round and brown... No, but pet names... Pet names are a part of the Indian thing, right? Does anyone's friends here, have you given any friends weird pet names? Anyone? Yeah, nobody? Yeah! Sorry? Mihir? Why Lady Finger? Again, how do you know? You said he's been for a sperm test and now Lady Finger because "Hey, I've seen it." This is great, man... It's like I'm a fruit and he's a vegetable... It's amazing! So anyway, my son is called Vikramaditya... And here's what happens man, I don't know how many people know this, but like a very crucial juncture on becoming a parent is... Like people are always very excited by the first words that their kids say. The first word that they say is "Mamma", right? It's so exciting. Like when my son said Mamma, we were like "What an amazing orator!" "He's like the Barack Obama of babies." He called my wife Mamma. I am like amazing... Then he called my laptop, Mamma. He called me Mamma. And I'm like I haven't been to Bangkok this year. Then he called my maid Mamma. And I'm like how does he know? I don't know how biology works, just saying... And the weird thing is, the problem is I'm a North Indian. And what this means that it's very exciting to me... I genuinely want my son's first words, I want it to be a cuss word. I just want it. It's just that, the inner sleazebag that is there. You just want it. Like every time my wife is not looking I'm like "Say Asshole, na?" "Please, once. For Papa." "Say Asshole na." It'll be great. My son's first words - Asshole. And my wife is like "You know your father very well" But here's the thing man, I have a son... Let's come to the crux of the situation. People keep saying that girls and boys are not different, they're all the same. United as one. Girls and boys are completely different. OK? Girls have completely different skill sets. Girls become much faster at learning language, social skills. Girls become human beings faster than boys... Boys take a long time. If you're from Haryana... takes your whole life. He is 55 years old. Give him 2 more years. Girls learn language way faster. When my son was 16 months old, my wife has a friend of hers who also has a daughter... We used to keep getting all sorts of WhatsApp videos of her speaking all sorts of stuff, like "Twinkle twinkle little star!" "How I wonder..." "And, the theory of relativity is as follows." "And, the formula for Pi is 3.14158." And some shit. My son's only words at that time were... "Aaah! Aaah!" "Aaah! Aaah!" Which translates to "Pick me up you Porter." "You're a bald Porter, pick me up!" "Pick me up!" Girls are totally different... Boys are more excited about the physical stuff, right? They're excited about doing stuff. Girls are more excited about being humans, right? I go to a person who has a girl in the house and the girl is like chilling there like "Hey, wassup I'm a girl, I'm learning stuff" My son enters the house. He kicks the furniture, takes and throws it on people's faces. Takes ink dumps it on people's faces... My son is from the Shiv Sena! It's nuts. This is the last time I'm doing this show. It's okay! So girls and boys are completely different. And it's also the way you raise them like, here's what happened... My wife and me one year into having my son My wife was like "We should've had a girl." "You know what I'm just gonna dress him in a frock." And, I'm like, "You stay away from my son." I was away from home one day and my wife put my son in a frock and took photographs of him. That's something you never do with a baby boy. The two photographs you never take of a baby boy. One is him dressed as a girl. And the second is him naked. You never do it. Because one day he's gonna grow and have friends like these guys. And, they're just going to look and go, "Look! Look! Yours was so small." "So small." "Look! Look!" "It's not a Penis." "It's a Pe!" Some shit like that... And here's what happens, some Indians are sexists. I'm not saying all but some Indians are sexist. And it comes out in very bizarre ways, right? I have a friend of mine whose son is 12 months old. And he's very excited about this son's future. "My son's gonna grow up..." "and DO everyone." Nobody ever says that about a girl... Nobody, ever. Nobody says "Our daughter's going to grow up..." "and do everyone." The sex life of your children should not be a matter of your concern. You're looking so innocent, "What is sex?" My wife and me, we have a nanny... to take care of my wife. No, my nannies are crazy man. We went through a crazy amount of nannies. My son is a handful, it takes a lot to control my son. And we went through like 18 nannies in 18 months. This was like an Indian Idol for nannies. So I asked my wife "What are you looking for?" "Listen, okay. This lady is going to take care of our son." "She's supposed to be my soulmate." "What am I?" "Fried Pubes?" We had one lady who was special because she was Bengali which meant she was insane... And my son was 4 months at that time and this lady's like "Give the child some fish! Give him fish!" I'm like, he's 4 months old... And, she's like, "No, kids love fish!" "Give the kid fish!" And, I'm like, "If you're so excited..." "you only give him fish." She gave my son fish and my son just went blegh... She got pissed off at my son. She started screaming "What kind of child are you?" "Don't you know fish is so great for your brain?" FISH! FISH! FISH! What are you saying? We had crazy amount, insane amount of people to take care of my son. And then we realized - why we are doing this to ourselves? Why are we torturing ourselves like this, we're Indians. We have parents. This is now their job... And your relationship changes before and after you have a kid... Before we had a kid my wife and me, we used to look at both our sets of parents and be like "Yo! Wassup parents?" "We are an independent couple." "Aite, my nigga." "This is my house bitch." "This is my house." "You stay away from my house motherfucker." The second we had a kid "Relationships also get changed." "They get tied into new cloth." I learnt that whole song. Just for that shitty joke. I won't tell you the whole one because it ends with Smriti Irani becoming Education Minister. And that's not a happy ending for anyone. But that's the best part about having a kid... the best part about having kids is the grandparents. Grandparents love that kid, man. And, you should, if you... Are there any married people? Anyone? You guys are married? I like how there's already a girl between you. Oh so you are separately married? Oh OK wait. There are two couples and only one from each couple admitted to their marriage. You both are married and are you planning to have kids anytime? This is damn funny man. She's looking at him, he's looking at her. He's like, "We can definitely have sex but..." But you should have a kid and I'll tell you why. It's primarily for your parents. Dude, grandparents you have a kid and... Here's what happens, Especially when your parents retire that's when the grandchild is most important. My parents they retired recently, they don't know what to do with themselves. My dad is at any wedding. Anyone calls him. "The watchman's Uncle's dog's brother's..." My dad is there, like anywhere. You know when sometimes you go to an Indian wedding and you're like... "Who's that uncle?" That's my dad. My dad is there. You have a kid, my parents love my son... He can do no wrong in their eyes. My son could do anything. Like my son could set the house on fire, they'll be like, "Aww... he's so cute." "When he plays with fire, right?" "Oh my God." "He has an AK-47?" "So cute!" "He joined ISIS?" "Oh lelele, our Baghdadi." They don't give a shit. Don't give a fuck. And, look on an emotional thing... My son's favourite person on the earth is my dad. He loves my dad. And my dad has a very bad back... Despite that my dad keeps carrying my son everywhere. The joy that he feels carrying my son completely defeats the pain in his back. It's like beautiful. It's amazing! My son is the world's tiniest Physiotherapist. It's awesome. And look here's what happens, when you have a kid is when you realise The importance of your parents in your life... It took me a long time, I became a dad. You're never prepared for it. It's like an entrance exam for medical. It's like... You're never ready. You land up there like "What is this?" And the government is like... we changed the date... Which doctors also do for child delivery. My son is NEET! You're always miscast, man. You start realising that your parents, the importance that they had in your lives. All parents in some shape or form are your heroes. It took me time to realise that my dad is my hero And this happens with a lot of parents. They have a yin and yang thing. They represent two sides of the coin. My mom is about investments and brokerage and FD's. And my dad is like "Do they serve alcohol in this restaurant?" Two different opinions in the world... Does this happen to you guys? Are your parents your heroes? What's the most heroic thing your parents have done for you? You're planning to go to U.S.? After 12th? What are you planning to do? Engineering? Good stuff. Your dad was very supportive of... you becoming an engineer? What? An Indian parent who wants their child to become an engineer? When you become a father the problem is... I realised I have to be more responsible. Because fathers can never disappoint their sons Sons can disappoint their fathers, that's fine! Abhishek Bachchan - Amitabh. Absolutely OK. Rajeev Gandhi - Rahul Gandhi. Absolutely fine. Siddharth Mallya - Vijay Mallya. I don't know who's disappointing whom. It's stuck somewhere. But similar to the career thing. Parents are heroic in bizarre ways. I've been doing this for a long time, this crap that I do with my life. And from the time when I was 23 till the time I was 28 I earned such little money... that I didn't have to pay tax. That's when you know you're doing badly... When even the government is like, "You let it be." "We'll handle it." And my parents throughout this thing were very supportive, man. They were go out there and live your life... The main reason is my sister is a genius. My sister's all out there and winning scholarships and all. And they are like, "This bald fucker!" "Mr. Gupta - must be your son only." They never put pressure on me with regards to career. Lot of Indian parents they put too much pressure on their kids with regards to careers. Like for a lot of Indian parents they think like will my child be a Doctor, an Engineer... or adopted? It's a very pertinent thing. A lot of parents are very gung-ho about putting their kids in Engineering. Let's take a little bit of survey - How many engineers here? This whole room, my God... First of all I don't want to make fun of engineers, okay? Because life is doing that to you. I don't want to do it. But a lot of parents put so much pressure I don't understand when do people realise, like when a baby is 4 days old in... When do they realise? "Mother..." Babies are so annoying in a theatre, right? Who's calling? Your dad's saying "It's cancelled, you'll not become an engineer." "Go to Bangladesh, bro!" No, man. But, like parents put this pressure, right? And I don't understand like when you're a baby, at what stage, like a 4 day old baby... What aptitude has that baby shown to become an Engineer? "Yeah, when he drinks milk, no?" "From right side is 10 ML." "Left side is 10ML." "Chemical Engineer." Like what the fuck are you talking about? And so much pressure man. Look here's what happens. We do a lot of shows in a lot of engineering colleges. And, I was at one of them, I won't name it... I did this show in the morning and I was staying on the campus at night and I was just roaming around the campus at around 11:30 because I'm sad and lonely. And there's a crazy amount of commotion for 11:30 PM. There was this dude on a cycle just like riding by and I stopped him. He's like, "Bro, great show man." I said, "Thanks bro, whatever." I'm like, "Why is there so much commotion?" "Nothing man." "Somebody committed suicide." "Do you want hash?" That dissemination of information deserves a lot to be required. Yes! But... Let's solve the question first... No, but. Crazy amount of frustration and it comes out even in like ragging I'm not condoning ragging at all. It's a disgusting thing. But it comes out, the desperation comes out in such bizarre ways. I went to one college they were like "When a new student enters, we make him a Firefly!" Firefly!! I am like what are you talking about? So apparently the way this works is when a fresher comes in they basically wait for the dark. And they make the fresher pull down their pants. And, then they take an incense stick... And the wooden part, they stick it in the butt... And then they go to the top of the terrace and look down and say, "See Firefly!" This is the shittiest National Geographic programming... I have ever seen. And honestly again if you are in an... engineering college, the incense stick is... Like I love Engineers man. You guys are building this nation. One joint at a time... It's amazing, you guys are doing it. But let's talk about the other career man, the other career people are obsessed with man people are obsessed, Indians are obsessed with that other career. Doctors! Yeah! Obsessed with the shit... I really respect you guys man. You guys study for 3000 years... and then die. So doctors man you guys are crazy man Like so much pressure put on people to become doctor. I had a friend of mine she was forced to become dentist... Almost a doctor, and... And the reason her parents wanted her to be a doctor because they are like she will get a good marriage proposal... like what fucking stupid attitude. And she got a marriage proposal from a guy who was basically in the US... Not you, someone else. And... She got married to this guy in the US and she reached the US and she discovered she had to do dentistry She studied 5 years in India. Had to do it dentistry all over again. Because, apparently Americans have different teeth from us. Like if you drill them oil comes out. What the fuck are you talking about? It's the same teeth. Look I don't want to put this kind of pressure on my son, man. I don't want my son to be a doctor. Or, Engineer. Or, Lawyer. Or, whatever. I want my son to be happy. That is all. I want my son to be happy... That's it. I want my son to be happy. Being a doctor or an engineer. Classic turn around, right? Initially you were like What a thought... Bastard. But look man like education is a big part of this whole thing man. Education is a big part. Like, as you guys have discovered for the last 60 minutes in my company I am a disgusting human being. We all confirmed? Confirmed 100% locked. And this is the decision that comes to me with regards to my son. The reason I am this disgusting person is I went to an All Boys' School. It makes you like this... How many boys went to All Boys' School? Where did you study? Sorry? St Pious? It's a great college name, school name... What about you? It's always a convent right? Like St. Pious, Bishops and... Our Lady of Perpetual Sorrow. One lady just standing there like "Aaah!" "I feel so sad at your virginity. Your life sucks." And it makes you a disgusting person, man. You're just surrounded for 10 years you are just in a room full of boys. Makes you such a disgusting person. You come out. You don't know how to talk to women at all! You don't know what to do. No women like when I came out I didn't know how to talk to woman. No woman wants to talk to me I was like "He he! Boobs!" It screws you up, man. It screws you up. It makes you like you become so disgusting as a person man. I feel like I felt so bad for any ladies who were teaching in my school man. Like we had one teacher and she was very cute. And, by that I mean she was under 55... And the most exciting thing about her was that she used to wear skirts. And this was amazing for us. And she never taught my class ever. And then one day she came to my class as a substitute teacher. And she gave us a free period. And, she sat down on the chair... The number of erasers... That fell on the floor! People will be like eraser... People are like starting rubber plantation. Eraser... It's disgusting... I felt so bad. There was another teacher there was a friend of mine Rishi, OK? And Rishi was an average student at best, OK? Then one lady was teaching us in class once. And, Rishi was paying a lot of attention... Like crazy amount of attention. So at the end of the class I asked him like "Dude why were you paying so much of attention?" He is like "Hey I am a good student." I am like Fuck Off. Tell me the real reason. He is like "Bro! What happens man is damn crazy man." "You know what happens you know if you are sitting like parallel to her right." "At an 83 degree angle." "At 12 o'clock you know when the ultraviolet rays." "When they hit the sun the window pane right?" "There is refraction and because of the refraction, no?" "You can see her bra!" So much knowledge just to see a bra! And Rishi is by the way one of the biggest doctors in Mumbai right now! I like to think this inspired him he is like, "Science sucks." I can see bra because of refraction. I love SCIENCE! So stupid. But it makes you a disgusting person. It really genuinely does man. Like I thought I was a disgusting human being like going in a boys school all along. Then I'm like never going to find a woman... Then I met my wife who went to an All Girls' school. Which is a different level... Not only that, my wife went to an All Girls' hostel. That is double the frustration. And she used to keep telling me stories like "You know what used to happen." "When we used to hit our puberty, no?" "Our boobs used to come out." "And, we used to keep punching each other's boobs." "And we used to find this really funny." I am like your joke... is our porn! So I have decided that my son is going to an All Girls' hostel. He is going to be Vijender Singh. Oh but not only that my school and all is like next level thing right? My son is as I mentioned is 19 months at moment. And when my son was like 17 months we had to put him in a Play School. My wife is like, "Shit yaar we missed the deadline it's crazy." "People apply when they are 18 months." "Some apply when they are 12 months." "Some apply when they are pregnant only." I am like call up doctor when you are having sex only, no? Start off there. Like, "Yes. Hello doctor what's going on? How are you doctor?" "No, no we were making a baby!" "No, no it's Doggy Style - 100 % confirmed." But look here what's happens man here's what happens like... The show has been disgusting. Let's take the next level of filth. I want to talk for a second about breastfeeding, OK? And it's not a disgusting thing right? It's a bizarre thing as a husband to get used to this stuff. It's really bizarre... Because again it's like watching something which you had so much fun with... Just... Turn into something for utility. Like it's like watching Pornhub... It is damn weird. And as a man you have no contribution to this whole thing. The whole process you have nothing to do. The only thing men do with this breastfeeding is... we burp the baby. If you don't know... You just take it like and, "Yes burp now! Take this!" I am great father... That's the job and breastfeeding by the way. I checked up online apparently that men can also lactate. Check this up on Google. Men can also lactate. If you squeeze the nipples long enough. No! And by the way with that logic: ANYTHING could lactate, if you squeeze it long enough... That's how soya milk is made... You just go... Take this milk. It's like fucking crazy. So breastfeeding is a bizarre thing. And, lot of cultures accept breastfeeding wholeheartedly. Lot of cultures do it. Like even here like Nepal, Bhutan, Africa all over the place... You are very excited. Bhutan is nearby... "Hello, Makemytrip?" "Prepare my breastfeeding package fast." I don't know why you are calling them up but whatever... I was in one country where they also have a... They also have a... they are very open about this breastfeeding thing. I was in a place called Zambia, which is in Africa. And great fun we were having we were in a... I was with my friend Ngoma. Who's like a superb guy he is like wonderful. First of all his name is kickass he is like, "I have Ngoma." What a great funky name and we were on a boat party or whatever it was a hippo. And we are having a good time. And everyone is drinking and dancing and we are having great fun. It's all fucking awesome and shit and it's great and suddenly... In the middle of this whole thing Ngoma's wife she just goes and sits down on a chair. And she just whips out a baby from I don't know where... Like that's the one Angelina left behind. I don't understand! And she whips out one of her... And, it's as big as the baby. Like the baby is looking like what the... I am not the Manjhi the Mountain Man. And then suddenly she whips out another baby. I don't know from where these babies are coming from. Whips out another baby and then whips out one of her... Continents... and... She does something I have like it was amazing. I am not looking this from dirty filthy perspective. It's like amazing beautiful thing to watch... Because she started to feed both the babies, simultaneously. It was amazing. It was like watching her ride a Royal Enfield. And I am watching this amazed. Not out of any filthiness. Not like, "Oh ho Black Watermelons." I am watching this genuinely fascinated because this is a beautiful thing to watch. The problem is again, I am a North Indian. Even when we are trying to look innocent we look like... And I'm doing this and I suddenly see Ngoma looking at me looking at his wife. And I'm like fuck! He's gonna kick my ass... Ngoma walks to me like, "Hey man..." "She got some big ones, right?" That's insane. And he is black, dude. If he wanted he didn't even need a weapon to kick my ass. He just come with like just like! After that joke I can't have any babies... I got to admit that's the only reason I have a Mike Stand. It's only there for me to have a giant black penis. That's the only purpose of it. Ah but let's talk if you are dirty enough let's talk about something filthier... Let's talk about sex, sex after having a baby is crazy, right? And the problem is like for women also like the main reason you can't have sex is... Because women have been through a biological change. And all that stuff. Like, it's been a problem. The problem is men are also to blame. Because once we have a baby we are like "My job is done!" "I have done what not... I have created." Like we are done. Like my wife during her pregnancy put on 6 kilos I put on 8. Because I am a Team Player, guys. The reason I put on weight there was like my wife had crazy hunger pangs. Pregnant women have bizarre hunger pangs. In the middle of the night she is like I want Goat ice-cream with a flavour of oyster below with a Mentos on top. Something bizarre shit. And I get it home and my wife would do the whole girl thing. She is like," 5 bites, I am full." And I will be like... Put on a crazy amount of weight. And, the reason I put on weight primarily is because I love non-veg and I love alcohol. OK, I love non veg. How many people are non-vegetarians here? Yeah, awesome. How many people are vegetarians? That's fine. That's OK, guys. We don't judge. The thing is the reverse happens a lot, right? Vegetarians judge non-vegetarians a lot, right? "Oh my God. You're eating a living thing oh my God..." "It's a living thing." Dude I am eating a chicken. Have you seen chickens? Chickens are fuckall alright? All are like... A chicken is never going to amount to anything... A chicken is never going to be a president. Donald Trump is trying, but, he is never gonna be President. It will be Tofu, Hillary Clinton... Don't ask why. People are confused like what? No but okay here... see here is the thing people don't tell you this enough Babies are evil, OK? Babies are evil. Who else thinks babies are evil? Who all thinks babies are evil, anyone? Anyone? What is the most evil thing baby has done to you so far? Cry on a plane... Yeah they're crying because they have air pressure. You piece of shit... How dare you judge my baby? The weird thing is: 1.5 years back I am like babies are dickheads. No but I get it, OK? Babies are evil though... Babies are evil OK. And, the thing is they get away with a lot of shit because, they are cute. They do something evil and there are like hehe. And we are like, "Awww." My son is evil as fuck. He does such evil shit. My son and me we were on a bus... We are not poor... We were going to the plane... It was a GoAir flight. I have no money... and... My son is sitting next to this other baby and these two babies are just checking each other out like "Whatup bro, you still poop and shit and whatever?" And suddenly I see my son he looks at the other baby takes his hand. And puts his entire hand into the baby's mouth... And starts massaging him everywhere inside. I'm like you are not toothpaste. What are you doing? There is no ad which says "Does your toothpaste have a baby?" There is no shit like that. Another incident: I was applying for my son's passport... OK. We are sitting in the passport office. And it was me, my son and there was this... very lovely Muslim lady in a hijab. And we were generally having a... Relax! You're like, "Oh, he said Hijab!" So we are sitting and I was generally having a very fun conversation with this lady. Like a really casual fun friendly conversation like... She's like oh RSS rocks. And, Modi is my One Direction and... And I am like Owaisi-what a cool guy. And Zakir Naik eh? You know casual conversation. No, we were actually having a fun conversation. And generally like laughing and shit. And, suddenly I see my son look at me. And look at her and then go out there and grab her... Silkiness. And in my head I am like shit dude. Do you know the country we are living in right now? Everything is a religious horror story. I am imagining the news the next day... "Molester Hindu Baby Causes Communal Riots!" Shit like that. And this lady just looks at my baby like... "Haha he's a kid..." "I would've chopped him, if he were a man." She said that as a joke... just... Some of you are like... "What? Did she really say that?" And the most ultimate story of my son being evil... Like I play with my son all the time... Like we have great fun playing... And once I was alone with my son... And we were having a lot of fun in the house... Right we were just playing and I am running around like Hahaha! And, he is running around like Hahaha! And then I am lying down on the floor and I am looking at him like Hahaha! And he looks at me like... Hahahaa! And he pukes in my mouth. There is no level of intimacy... Which takes it this far! There is French kissing where we go 'Nom nom nom' There is no Scandinavian kissing going... I mean who does that shit? And, wait. You guys are disgusting... Disgusted? This happened to me. And this story is not over yet... It gets worse. This was the first day my wife and me had started giving my son solid food. He was 6 months at the time. And the food that we had started him off on was: Bottle gourd, Aubergine and Avocado. Like he had gone straight to Mediterranean hors de vors from... Booby milk! It is fucking nuts. Aubergine and bottle gourd. Aubergine and bottle gourd are the most disgusting veggies in the world... They are like the KRK and Munaf Patel of veggies. They are disgusting! And you know what is more disgusting than Aubergine and bottle gourd? The puke of Aubergine and Bottle Gourd in your mouth! And I realised. Hey man my son is doing this for time pass. He is not just doing this for Ehh... He is trying to send out a message... Babies are evil geniuses... He is trying to send out a message to me... Hey yo, baldie - what up, bitch? You gotta get me some good food man... You give me some Aubergine? I am going to puke it in your mouth. You give me Bitter Gourd... I will shit in your face. He has had mutton biryani every day since that day. But yeah look: babies are evil and shit but, it's fine... Yeah, I made fun of him for a while but I fucking love my son. He is awesome. I play with him all the time. And we play all sorts of games also all the time. Like we have one game where... He takes all my stuff. He hides it. And then he gives me back 2% of it. It's called... Being the Congress. Umm...It's a good game. There is another game where he hides. And I can see him but I just can't catch him... It's called Being Lalit Modi... it's a... it's an exciting game... There is also another game going as a toy train set and we set it on fire... If you know, you know. There is a game also which is based on Arvind Kejriwal... We play it every alternate day. And whoever loses blames the BJP. It's a great game. No but we play all the time man... It's...it's awesome fun. I love playing with my son. And the reason I play with him is that the bond with my son. Actually started even before he was born. Now I want to tell you a quick story. So what happened was that this time my wife was 7 months pregnant. And my wife is like,"You know what?" "You should talk to the foetus inside the womb." And I was like, "You should see a psychiatrist." She's like, "No, at 7 months their ears start developing." "So they can hear stuff.Ó I am like,"Seriously Dr Zaveri sits from 4 to 6." "I can pencil you in." And then I did it because I am a great father. And my wife threatened divorce. And... And it's a bizarre thing... What are you supposed to say to a thing inside the stomach? What are you supposed to say? It's a bizarre thing... Like what do you say? Hey bro. What's up? How's it going? You seen any good movies lately? Like any way you are in an IMAX dome. Haha! Joke, son. Joke. What do you say? Then I realised something... Dude this is an unborn entity. He has no consciousness. He has no idea what the hell it means to be alive. He has no clue... He is not going to remember Jackshit. So what I decided was I am just going to start telling him in gory detail... about how he was conceived. And this is a true story. My wife and me... We conceived my son in Grand Hyatt Goa. And then when we were trying for the 2nd child, We tried in Leela in Delhi... Because we only have 5-star kids. We should just name them after the hotel they were conceived in, right? That's my son Hyatt. We love him dearly. What a lovely guy. Our daughter, Leela. Ah, she is so beautiful. So intelligent. And, that's the child we didn't want... That's OYO rooms, yuck. So, I am like you know what? I am just going to tell him all the shit about... how he was conceived. And, I am like. So son, what happened, no? Your mom and me went to Grand Hyatt Goa. We had so much fun. The beds were so bouncy, it was amazing. And, we had breakfast buffet... Such amazing sausages. Your dad's sausages! Joke, son. Joke! And, I am like forget about it whatever. Did it like 10-12 times, whatever. From the time he was 7-9 months. Cut to the day my son was born. I just said... cut to the day my son was born. And a baby started crying. This is cray. Whoever did that. You are better at choreography than Prabhu Deva... That is amazing... So, anyway. Cut to day my son was born and he popped out of my wife and... People say all this shit about like childbirth...like childbirth... It's a miraculous thing. And it's a celebration of life... And a manifestation of humanity and souls and fucking. It is bullshit, it is disgusting. Childbirth is disgusting! That kid comes out like full of strawberry milkshake and... They look disgusting dude. Babies come out and you are like... When my son came out I was like... "Doctor sir - this one hasn't been cooked yet." "Put it back!" Like it's just... Anyway, my son came out. My son came out and he cried much like that baby and... He started crying because he has been like inside this place for like 9 months, living rent free. And... and the Doctor cuts his umbilical cord. And my son starts crying, OK? And the doctor takes him and puts him on this one table or whatever. And, these 8 or 9 - all the people involved... They are all these medical practitioners and they are trying to calm this child down. He is refusing to stop. He is bawling his head off, his eyes are darting all over the place, he can't stop crying. Nothing is working! And, then suddenly from across the room 10 minutes later I look at my son and I am like... Hey buddy. What's up? And he just looks, stops crying... And, he just looks like really bewildered. And he looks at me and gives this version of whatever the smile was. Alright, my heart fucking exploded dude. And I am like... Dude he was listening all along. And then I realised... Fuck! He was listening all along! This is going to mess him up in subconscious ways. He can't even understand. He will grow up to be 12 years old and I am like... Son, let's go for a vacation. Where do you want to go? "Grand Hyatt Goa, you bastard." "I heard they have great sausages!" 'My dad's!" "Joke, son. Joke." "Take it, you bald ass!" And look I just wanna give a shout out to... Like I saw my wife go through this whole childbirth and stuff and it's crazy man. Like I respect women in general; but, seeing that stuff... The respect went up like 15 times. This is like vaguely part of the show but I would just want to talk about this. I genuinely believe this. I genuinely think that Indian women are classier than Indian men. How many people agree? C'mon. Yeah? Do we agree? Women are classier, man. Everything you do is classier than us. When you guys want to go get a haircut You guys go to a stylist. Oh, yes - a stylist. Let's go to the stylist. Men go to barbers. "Give me Lalan's phone number right now!" And what's the difference between a stylist and a barber? The stylist speaks in English. That's it! You guys are basically paying 4000 Rs. extra. For subtitles. That's all you are doing. Of course, me going for a haircut? I mean - c'mon like. Soap is my shampoo. And shampoo is Anil Kapoor's soap. Tea-seller! But women are nice man. Women are nice. Women are nice! You guys are nice. Except to each other. You know what happens. Like every that same sex group. Like the same sex group of men or women. Like women are way nicer to that same sex group. And you know tightly knit right. And you are very supportive of all your friends. Like if you have a friend... there is always one friend in that group who is not very good-looking, right? I know because it's me. And, women are so supportive. You have a friend of yours not so good-looking like... Honey, you are a hottie. You are a hottie and a sizzling brownie. Here, eat some. Like it's like fucking great. Men don't have that shit... We have a friend of ours who is ugly like, we'll be like: "Bro, you look like an anus." "A God damn anus!" "Only way you are going to get a chick is if are rich." "That's the only chance you have." "But, enough about Mukesh Ambani." Let's move on. Women believe in stuff, man. You guys believe in stuff. Like again: I didn't want to have a kid. And my wife is like: just believe it's gonna be great and it was. It was amazing. Like because she believed it, I believed. Women believe in this stuff. Like you guys believe in like family, you guys believe in fate. You believe in all these wonderful concepts and stuff. Some of you of course take it too far. You believe in like star signs and shit. Which is like just next level of insanity. That's why you need somebody for the first time. Like oh my God. Wait, one second, just one second. You are born in September? That is crazy ya. That means you are probably like a Virgo or something? That means you're shy, gentle and kind. Men don't have that shit man. We meet somebody for the first time. We are like bro. You are born in September? Your parents fucked in Jan. Whoever is not laughing just did the maths right now. "Shee, mummy papa January nooo!" I was born on September 14th, so there you go. My son was born on March 22nd because... We wanted a tax-deductible baby. Missed it by 9 days. But look as in conclusion okay. In conclusion. I just want to answer like the very pertinent question you know. At the end of this kind of show... Thank you. My Archana Puran Singh is a baby. Like people ask this very pertinent question. They are like at the end of this puking in your mouth, And the fucking sleepless nights. And, all this money and shit like that. Is it worth it having a baby? And the answer of course is: No. Just pull out. Trust me. Just pull out and say Sorabh told me. I'm leaving. Just do it. And the bizarrest thing about having a baby. I started the show initially by saying that my wife is paranoid dude. The thing is if you have a kid you become paranoid. You are thinking about this child. All day and all night. Everything about this child consumes you. I will be in the same house as my son. I'll be inside. I will be in the bedroom. My son is outside. And I will be having all this big questions about my son: Will he be a good man? Will he achieve all his dreams? Will he be good to women? Will he do whatever he wants to in his life? And I go to the drawing room. And I see my son looking at a pigeon farting. And laughing his head off! This dude is laughing at a pigeon farting. And you hear that laughter and it is entirely... If it's your kid, that laughter is fucking amazing man. If it's your child. This is the child you have and it's... The fucking most glorious thing that you can ever hear in your life, man. And it ties in very quickly to even what I do even as a comedian. I love making people laugh. It's the thing that makes me the happiest in the world. And, and that's why when you come to a show like this. And you come to a comedian at the end of the show, And say that for the last 90 minutes I forgot all my worries. That's the highest compliment you can ever give us. It's the nicest thing you can ever say. And, when I come to you at the end of the show and say: For the last 90 minutes, I forgot all my worries. I just made an ass out of you! But guys, I have been doing this for a long time man. I have been doing Standup for like 8.5 years. Done 1200 shows in 80 cities across the country. 16 countries all over the world. And, I wanted to make people laugh. And, very recently I realized: That none of it matters. Because, my baby thinks I am funny. And, that's all that counts. Thank you so much ladies and gentlemen. You've been a lovely crowd, man. Thanks a lot. Thanks a lot, guys. I appreciate it! Bye, Bye!
