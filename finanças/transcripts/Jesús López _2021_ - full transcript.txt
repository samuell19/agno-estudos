Jesús, buddy, stop. - Go home. - Don't be stupid! - What's going on? - Nothing. I'm going. - Let's go inside. - I've had enough. - Come on. - Why should I? - Let me go. - You're a pain. Let me go! Jesús! I pray for Jesús's soul, for the fields, for the animals, and for all those who need them. I pray for my brother, for Irene, and for Jesús's soul. I pray for my cousin Jesús, and for my daughter. - Where's your sister? - Outside. - My condolences. - Thanks. Go and check on everyone, it's like an oven outside. Abel and Alfonso will help, don't worry. Go and see if Irene needs anything. - Some water? - No, thanks. Dad? Bring me some wine. - Wine? - Yes. I'll bring it in a bit. I never saw him drinking, but... He hadn't been drinking. He just lost his temper. I don't understand it. I followed him outside, he got on his motorbike, and then he shot off. At top speed. Thanks. I saw him, he was in a state, really worked up. Regular or Diet Coke? Regular. That shirt. No, that one. With that t-shirt underneath. And the jeans. No, those. And those trainers. The new ones. Those? That's good. My boy will look handsome. Like he's going dancing. Goodbye, old friend. Keep turning! Here. I don't want to watch this. It's bad for the baby. Go to bed, then. It feels weird. I've got a bad feeling, Abel. Are you listening? Yes, but let me watch the film. Your hand calms him down. Here are your chips. Do you want any sauce? No, there's some on the table. - Thank you. - Thanks. Marco sent me a text. He's looking for work in Buenos Aires. Well, there isn't any here. I'm not going to go. Look at them. It hasn't even been 2 months, and they're at it again. Why won't they stop? They'll end up like Jesús. - Don't say that. - Look at them! There they are, drinking before riding their motorbikes. They're pathetic. I had a craving for chips. All of a sudden. Hello. - Come in. - How are you? - Okay? - Yes. - I'll go in, then. - Yes, go on. Coming through! Look at the speed. You see? He was working weekends on it with Cacho. Bit by bit. It's big. This is his bedroom. He won that one in his first go-kart race. - He was six years old. - So young. You never saw your cousin race. No, but I wish I had. He was the best in the province. You can't imagine how it feels to be on the podium. Speed has never been our thing. We have to go. Alfonso's in the fields on his own. Come and see us, it'll do you good. Cacho's going to the river with Jesús's friends tomorrow. Great. Do you want to come, Abel? Yes, but I don't know. I'd have to come back here first. Stay the night. That's a good idea. Sonia and I can help Dad. But he'll be too hot at the river in his jeans. Don't worry about that. See you, my boy. - Come on, Sonia. - Bye, auntie. These will fit you. They're brand new. And these? No, they're worn. Swimming trunks. His racing suit. Always spotless. Oh, look. He wore this shirt to go dancing. Always the same one. They must have got fed up with him at the nightclub. - Sleep tight. - You too, Auntie. - See you in the morning. - Yes. It'll be OK, Irene. You must try to sleep. - Leave me alone. - This can't go on. Leave me alone. It's tough on the farm, isn't it? Everyone's leaving the countryside. It's not easy. But it's our whole life. I told your mother to sell up and go and live in town. There are more opportunities there. It expands your mind. Do you know why? Because money gives you access to technology. Cows will always be cows. They're not smart animals, unlike dogs. Do you come here a lot? We don't get out much. The heat! Take you t-shirt off, you'll melt. Go for a dip, the water must be nice. I'll go after you. I'll keep an eye on our stuff. Go on! At the weekend we never know if we're going out. Do you want to or don't you? I give up. - No, seriously. - Okay, we'll go out. I know him. I mean, I've seen him a couple times. We have to track him down, find out where he lives. Apparently, his parents don't know what to do with him. He doesn't want to study or get a job. We just have to let him live with his guilt. Let him suffer. That's all he deserves. His parents are afraid he'll do something stupid. We should kill him, as simple as that. - What are you on about? - Kill him. He drove into Jesús and killed him. He should pay. I'm up for that. But I'm not sure if... How about you, Abel? What do you say? Nippur. No, Azul! Look at him, he's lovely! - Are you cold? - Freezing. Here. Careful on the sand. What's up? Keep hold of him, he's annoying all the girls. What's he doing? Running all over the place. They're Jesús's shorts, aren't they? Yes. Irene gave them to me. They're too big for you. How is she? Fine. She's slowly getting over it. I'll stop by in the next few days. Come on, Azul, let's go. See you. - That's his cousin, isn't it? - Yes, he lives on a farm. What were you doing? Why are you talking to him? Three... Two... One, two, three, four, five. There! Come on! Hurry up, Abel! Give that to your aunt. He's acting strange. The neighbour thinks Jesús has been reincarnated in Nippur. Really? He's probably just missing him. Abel, can you give me a hand? Coming, Uncle. Abel. Don't tell your uncle what I just told you. He doesn't believe in that sort of stuff. And he's perked up a bit. It did him good, going to the river. Here, the pills. What is it, Uncle? I need your help. - What can I do? - There's a problem with the engine. Move the eggs, they could spoil the paintwork. - What do I do? - Start it up. How? Lower the red lever and press the black button. The red lever... and the black button? That's it. Give it a moment, then again. Oh, the turn! You're going really fast. Are you scared? No. You have to go fast into the turns. What if the car rolls. It holds the road really well. You have to hold the wheel firmly in both hands. They've finished harvesting here. All done? See if the light has gone out. Has it gone out? It looks like it. It's okay, then. Do you feel up to driving it? Slowly, take your time. You have to feel the car. Don't be scared. You're flooding the engine. Take it slowly. Nice and easy. Trust yourself. Accelerate. Go on! Hello, Zulma. - How are you? - Fine. What are you doing? Your son's a great driver. - Abel? - Yes. The dogs were howling when they heard Jesús's car. It's the exhaust that bothers them. - Where are you rushing to? - Uncle and Auntie's. - Again? - Yes. - Let's go. - Where are you going? He's going to stay with us. Take care. Remember what to do? Of course. Drive carefully. Let's go. Renzo, will you get a beer? Who'll buy me one? Aren't you a bit young to drink? Go on, rev it up! Go on, dance! Azul, don't do that to me! What are you doing here? - What are you looking at? - I saw someone. Didn't you? Going up there? You scared me. For once I didn't get in a fight at the bikers' rally. Did Jesús stir up trouble? We were always getting in fights. He'd drag everyone into it. Fortunately, you're not like him at all. - No? - Let me see. Sometimes I dream about Jesús. He turns up on his motorbike, parks it in front of the house, and knocks on my window in the middle of the night, so I'll let him in. But I refuse to get up, so he hits the window so hard it breaks, and then I wake up. Did you dream that or did it really happen? Both. What are you afraid of? I'm afraid of... not being afraid and doing something stupid. I like you. I like you too. Hello. How was the bikers' rally? Not bad. Did you see Azul? Yeah, she was with her friends. Since Jesús died I've had a lot of work to do. I have to be his replacement in the house. I imitate his voice to talk to Nippur. I imitate his voice to talk to Cacho. So as not to lose contact with him. That mustn't happen. I don't want to suffer again like in the days after the funeral. I just wandered around, crazy with grief. My legs were swollen. At night the insomnia and fear were terrible. Poor Cacho doesn't have a very strong wife. Are you tired? Go to bed, I made your bed. Put your trainers outside with talc in them. Okay, Auntie. Don't forget, trainers outside. Sleep tight. Hey, Nippur. Get down, I want to go to sleep. Get down. Clear off, Nippur! There, it's alight. It's taken? It's fine. How much did the insurance offer you? A hundred. How much? A hundred thousand. That's peanuts. It's nothing. Make the bastards cough up. The scumbags are taking the piss. Make them cough up. Is that all they consider Jesús's life was worth? Do you think their money will bring my son back? Abel. You stink of booze. You're sleeping with the dog? This mattress is comfy. I'd noticed. When you're not at home I can't sleep. The baby keeps kicking. This wine's good. - I didn't understand that. - Nor me. There's no stopping that dickhead! Hey, language! A drop more. No, that's enough. - Stop him boozing. - Stop it! It's going to be the last race of the year. They're going to pay tribute to Jesús. It'd be good to go, wouldn't it? Will you drive Jesús's car? Not me, no. Abel, if he feels up to it. It won't be a competition race. Ask your sister if she agrees first. Why wouldn't she? I don't know. You say he's good, but... it scares me a bit. What about you, Alfonso? I don't know, we'll have to see. I'm up for it. We'll talk about it. - What about the car after that? - We'll get rid of it. It says here that the baby already has nails. Gross! You're carrying something with nails. The way you talk about your goddaughter! You're not going to drive in that race? No. Here, listen! - What? - Listen. - What? - Come here. Don't drive in that race, Uncle! I'm begging you! I didn't hear anything. I'm going to sleep. You won't do it, will you? No, Sonia. - Do you swear? - Yes. - All good? - Yes. We'll show you. - Put them here. - Wait. - There's one missing. - Don't look! Don't look. Ready? - No. - Not you. There. This is our ritual. We did it before every race. - Give me your finger. - You know the circuit? You're on the starting line. - Ready? - Yes. On your marks... go! First, second. Right turn, left turn. Third, fourth. Tight turn to the right, I stay in fourth. A long straight, then third, then second. Right turn, left turn. I go back up into third, fourth. Tight turn to the right. I stay in fourth. - That's it, you're there. - Already? That wasn't so hard. Sit here. - Long hair is back in. - I didn't know. If you want a girlfriend, you should let it grow. Otherwise you have no chance. Where did he put his comb? There. And so you don't lose your hair like your uncle, put aloe vera on it. I have some plants, I'll put some in the fridge for you. All right. - The wind won't blow it down. - No, it'll stay up. You took your time. What's with the scarecrow? - I think it's great. - Come and see, it's fantastic. We made it yesterday. Would you prefer a cross? This is more original. It seems to be facing the road. - It represents Jesús really well. - It looks like wings. We'll all forget about it in a day or two. - No, we'll take turns. - We'll take care of it. We'll all look after it. It's like a crow. It's a bird, it doesn't matter what kind. It's really well made. Here, mate, I'm leaving you a smoke. Aren't you leaving anything? Or behind, in the Ford Escort. Yeah, in there. I have to find a carburettor. Camila! Renzo! I'm looking for a carburettor. Have a look over there, in the Falcon. Come on! Abel! We'll fall over! The old man! Abel! Let's go! You're acting weird. Shall I download a film for tonight? I can't. You have to take me for tests, remember? When did you start smoking? Can you turn the music down, please? That guy in the car, one day I'm gonna bust his face. Are you serious? It's nothing. Calm down. Come on! Any more and he'd have killed him. You can't leave like that. Why not? Jesús! No, but you... "Everything's better in town." This is where the fun is. The grass is always greener. I want to see what's going on there. Isn't that the guy who hit Jesús? He's getting away. Quick! Kill him! Kill him! Kill him! All right, Alfonso? I've sold my cows. I'm done with that damn dairy. What are you going to do now? Take care of my kids. My family. Keep them on the straight and narrow. It's impressive how confident Abel is behind the wheel. It's not good to be too confident. It's a tribute race, Alfonso. If we took care of our kids, there'd be fewer accidents. You're telling me that? Abel was saved by a miracle, unlike Jesús. If it was dangerous, I wouldn't let him do it. Irene and I just want to watch a few farewell laps. You're making your farewell to the wrong person. You're right, Alfonso. A child on fire in front of his house. His father left him alone with the fire and now he watches him burn. The child can't cry, the flames get in his throat. His father is paralysed. He watches his son burning. A neighbour grabs a hose to put out the fire. Other neighbours come running and take the child to the hospital. His father just stands there by the table. He can't move or speak a word. You might think he's shaking, but no. I was scared, I didn't know what to do. Throw water over you, grab a fork, a spade, cover you in earth, throw myself on you, I didn't know. What would you have done in my place? Thrown myself on the fire. - So we'd both burn? - Yes. Be quiet, Nippur. They say that the dead who... were angry at the moment they died... don't obey the angel who... decides whether we should go to heaven or hell. My mother died angry. She disobeyed and stayed. That's what they say. That they stay trapped in a place, among the living. In all the places where they lived. They stay here, trying to attract our attention. Bothering us. Wanting us to hear them, one way or another. I love you. Jesús would never have said that. Your skin will be lovely and soft. Take it easy. Stop. Stop. That's enough. Get off! Why did you pin me down? Idiot! Jesús López was a very talented driver, who left his mark on the world of car racing. Jesús was a very fast driver, always there among the leaders, and on the last lap he'd go for it. No friendships survive on the track. He was aggressive, the way we all are. We remember him every time we race. We miss him. And sometimes... we don't miss him! Our stands were always next to each other. We'd have barbecues, that sort of thing. He was a good lad, we miss him. He was very calm and sporting during a race. I was talking about the moves we did on the track. They could be quite aggressive. Well, "aggressive" in a manner of speaking. Listen, this is important. Keep your eye on the rev counter. Between 20 and 50. Don't go over 50. Over 50, it's dangerous. I'm not messing about here! Okay? You understand? If you go over, slow down. This is a special day for all race fans, who are here to pay homage to Jesús López, a beloved driver of our category. Jesús, as long as we remember you, you'll never die. Come on, Jesús! The cars are all lined up. The engines are roaring! And they're off, for the last race of the year! Malena Rupp is in the lead, as throughout the year. Invincible Malena in her pink car! That's fine, you're in a good position. Hold that position. Keep calm. Maxi Turano is coming up. He needs these points. What a pace, from the very start of the race! Number 8 is going around the outside. Get past him. Nice and carefully. Accelerate! What a lovely move by Jesús's car, overtaking Hernandez on the inside! Great! That's good! Now slow down. Tell him to slow down, Cacho. Slow down, you're not here to win. Calm down. He's got his sights on Maxi Turano. This guy takes after his cousin Jesús. What's the temperature? Jesús López's car moves up another place! Tell me what the display shows. Listen to me! Slow down! Jesús's car is flying! - He must slow down. - He's not responding. Jesús López's car goes into second place! Now he's taking on Malena, the double champion. Will his car bear the strain? We've seen this duel before. Jesús's car is moving at a furious pace. Malena isn't giving an inch. Jesús's car wants to make the most of the straight. What a duel between these two drivers! What a race! Jesús's car is moving up! Slow down, it's too dangerous. He's gone into the lead! What a race by Jesús López's car! It's taken the lead on this very special day! Amazing! But now there's smoke coming from Jesús López's car. He's not slowing down, despite the smoke. He's three seconds ahead of Malena Rupp. Five seconds ahead of Maxi Turano. Jesús's car keeps going, despite the smoke. There's a lot of smoke coming from Jesús's car now. Send help, his car is catching fire! The car is catching fire! I hope he's going to be all right. Jesús López's car is on fire! All this in the countryside. The cows. The fences. The dog. Sowing seeds. Maybe in heaven too there are dogs, meadows, fences. You'll find that out before me, Jesús. Maybe you know already, if you're already there. Always first, up there like down here. You jumped the fence, Jesús. Maybe the only way to get away from here is by dying. Lord, in one way or another, receive the soul of my cousin, and guide him to the celestial fields.
