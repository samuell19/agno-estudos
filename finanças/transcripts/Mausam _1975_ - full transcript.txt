"We remain sitting, waiting when to know..." "This heart lays in search..." "...once again for those days and nights of leisure..." "This delicate heat of autumn we bear..."

"We kept staring at the stars lying on terraces..." "This heart lays in search..." "...once again for those days and nights of leisure..." Hello Sir. - Hello. This is Mr. Chawla, our biggest distributor in eastern India. How do you do sir? Dr. Kamal Bose. How do you do? I know you well by your medicines. That is why I am infamous. In fact all my doctor friends prescribe your medicines. Nowadays your name dominates the market. - Okay. Mr. Chawla, isn't your head office in Calcutta? Yes. I had come here only to arrange this cottage for you. Mr. Bali had called. Didn't Mr. Bali mention over the phone that... ...during these holidays I do not wish to hear... ...even the names of medicines? I want a complete rest from work. Physical as well as mental. Neither do I want to tell anything about them, nor hear. Whose cottage is this? Dinshaw Irani's. A Parsi medicine man of Calcutta... ...who is now settled in Bombay. He has maintained his house beautifully. Yes, that is the uniqueness of the Parsis. Even if hundreds of years pass by, their wallpapers don't spoil. Greetings, sir... Greetings. I have heard you are very fond of eating and drinking. So I have arranged this cook for you. He cooks very well. The twin pills of Gill's medicines. You can have them with either water or milk. They provide relief from cold and cough immediately. These medicines do not leave me here also. They are medicines discovered by you, Dr. Gill. Yes, where am I refusing that? My deeds are chasing me. They don't leave me at all. Beautiful! Is this the first time you have come to Darjeeling? No, I have come once before also. Many years ago. About 25 years ago. Before I gave my doctor's examination. Then I had an accident. Accident? - Yes! I had fallen in love with a girl. Oh! That happens in youth, doctor I also had them. - With her? Yes. I mean, no. It was on the hill station and now... ...I am the father of her three kids. No, man, I did not do anything like that with her. That is why you were saved and I had to get married. Listen. - Yes sir. What is your name? - Mangal Singh sir. Mangal Singh sir? - No sir, only Mangal Singh. Tell someone to put the chairs out. We shall sit there only. Excuse me, Dr. Gill. I'll take your leave now. I have work in the hospital. I'll meet in the evening. Okay. - Mr. Chawla? Mr. Chawla, you too may leave. No need for formalities. I'll take some rest now. We'll meet in the evening. Bye for now. We'll meet in the evening. If you need me for anything, here's my card. Come on. Dhyan Singh... - Yes sir? Why are you throwing cold water on the car... ...early in the morning? I am feeling cold just by its sight. Don't you feel anything? It's better if I wash it now only. If the master asks for it... ...as soon as he wakes up, then what shall I do? This is not Calcutta; this is Darjeeling. Dr. Gill has come here on vacation. He'll not wake up so soon. Yes, this is the condition since yesterday. I myself was waiting till 11 o'clock. When will the master have breakfast? Today the master will have a very heavy breakfast. He has not eaten anything since yesterday. When will he have it? - As soon as he wakes up. Who will wake up? - The master. Early morning, the master... Now this hill station has changed a lot. When I had come here many years ago... ...there weren't so many cars here. There were only mostly rickshaws plying here. Now it is not even the season. When the season comes... ...you shall see, there's so much rush here that... ...people do not even get adequate place to stay. Then we could manage to get lodging at someone's house... ...as a paying guest even. I myself had stayed... ...at a contractor's place. Mr... Mr. Jodhpal. Do you know what the rent of the room was? Seven rupees. But sir, now that can be only dreamt of. Right said! The whole place looked different then. See that wood shed there? - Yes. There used to be a doctor's shop there. When had you come here before? It is many years now. But we are seeing this shed here like this since many years. I am talking of a time before that. You must be mistaken. No. I cannot be mistaken about this place. A little ahead from here, there are those stairs, isn't it? Those which descend from the Upper Bazaar? Yes. - Then this is the same place. But sir, there was never a doctor's shop here. We have always seen this shed here. You must be talking of the doctor Thapa. Yes, yes, he's the one. Harihar Thapa. It's ages since he died, sir. But he was not that old. Does it take time to grow old, sir? If there is sorrow, man can age very quickly. Which sorrow did he have? The sorrow of a daughter is very bad, sir. He had a young girl. She had a very pretty name... Chanda? - Yes, Chanda. You have a sharp memory, sir. Then? - She wouldn't marry. - Why? She would tell some doctor would come to take her. Then? Does anyone come back, sir? She was humiliated in society. We don't know who the man who gave her sorrow was. The doctor also stuck to the bed in such a way... ...that he died on the bed itself. Only before dying... ...he entrusted his daughter to a lame stammering man. Lame? Stammering? Yes. He was staying down in the Blue Valley. A factory had opened up there that time. We had heard Chanda also worked there. When she returned home upon her father's death... ...she had a child in her arms. Her husband did not come. Some tell he died; some tell he left her. Show that to me... - Here. Show me that one. - That one's mine. - Show it please. What happened? Did you have a fall? Yes. This... Is it a sprain or an injury? I do not know. Perhaps it is a sprain. There's a doctor here. Get him to put an ointment on it. It will be well in an instant. - Is that so? He is a very good doctor. Yes. Did you bring the herbs? Which all did you get? I found some of them. And I also found a patient, father. He has a sprain in his foot. He'll come now... ...to get an ointment put on it. Those stairs in the bazaar. He fell on them. Did he fall by himself or did you push him? Why will I push him? Who knows? You may be helping your father's business. Very good! If someone falls, that means I have pushed him. Don't know what he thinks of me! Come, come, come. Did you sprain your leg? Yes. It seems like that. It is the fault of the eyes, and the legs have to suffer. A foolish leader commits a folly; the whole village pays. Give me your foot. So you slipped on the bazaar steps? It doesn't matter. You are saved. If you had been hit on the head, that would be grave. Chanda, bring the herbal oil kept inside. I'm warming and bringing it, father. Shall I bring the turmeric also. Yes, bring that also. Did you see? Before the patient comes... ...the preparation of the medicine has begun. Do you know astrology also? Yes, I know. Okay! So that's how you came to know about it. Seen her? She's my astrologer. She keeps herself updated with the goings-on of the city. From where have you come? - From Calcutta. What is your name? - Amar Nath Gill. What are you doing? - Learning to be a doctor. It is the last year so I have come here for preparation. "Whether you take a prescription.". "...or rely on drugs..." "A man has to face the consequences of his deeds." "Whatever he does, the doctor ends up getting richer." If you do not have the sole intent of earning money... ...then there is no occupation better than this, Amar Nath. Amar Nath what? - Gill. There is so much pleasure in this job that... ...it cannot be expressed in words. It is like worship. That is why I am learning to be a doctor. So you'll open your clinic in the city? It won't work in the village. - Why? Who will buy such expensive medicines here, Amar Nath? Gill! Yes, Gill. Here only our herbs will work. The virtues are earned by the tree... ...while the peepal tree has to sacrifice. Where's a doctor like me who can take care of all? Once I have the knowledge, sir... ...I shall learn the wisdom from you. Where do you stay here? That bungalow of the contractor Jodhpal... I stay there only. That is very near. Father, the bandage. Okay, so you stay in Jodhpal's bungalow. - Yes. Anyway that remains vacant ten months in a year. Where do you eat? In a wayside restaurant. How bad! Being a student, you eat in a wayside restaurant? How will you top your class then? No, no, no. From today you'll eat with us. Okay Chanda? Thank you. How much? Let it be. First you become all right, Amar Nath... - Gill. I'll take the money later. When you come to dine at night... ...l'll change the bandage. Thank you. Good bye. Take care, take care. Take my stick. Chanda, give my stick. Bring in the evening without fail. - Okay. Father, the sprained one hasn't come. May I give his share to the goat? Why? Did you eat the hay meant for the goat? Am I an animal to eat the fodder of animals? Then why will you give his share to the goat? Does the goat also have a sprain? What is there about a sprain in this? Always doing charity. You don't take money from... ...the villagers because they are from the same village. You found one foreigner, but he too turned to be a student. More than a student, he has become something else. How will it do if you treat everyone for free? You have to get me married in the future. What then? Don't get married. Do you mean that? Can you promise me that? I can promise you but who will bear this headache for... ...a lifetime? Now you call me a headache. But when I shall go... ...you shall not be able to find anyone like me... ...who would find your herbs for free. Go yourself in the jungles then. Listen Chanda, I'll do one thing. I'll see Amar Nath myself. He stays near here in Jodhpal's bungalow. No need. I am going to Hansa's place. I'll see him on the way. Doesn't give any money; on top of that, he's taken the stick. You? Come. Come inside. You did not come to eat. Father was waiting. I could not come. I have fever. This foot is also swollen. You did not eat anything? I am not hungry. I have warmed the milk. I'll drink that only. You sit. I'll bring it. Where's the milk? There in the kitchen. Drink the milk and sleep now. I'll tell father. He'll come here and change the bandage tomorrow. Do you have a thermometer at your place? What? A thermo... - What is that? It is a glass tube. What is that? Tube. A tube of glass. It has mercury below it. What below? Mercury. Mercury. When you put it in your mouth... ...you know the temperature. I mean, fever. What is there to laugh in that? Do you need a tube to tell about fever? We can simply touch and tell how much fever one has. Touch me and tell how much fever I have. You have. But not much. Shall I bring the medicine tomorrow? What tablets, I mean medicine do you have? No tablets. I have some flowers, which I shall... ...boil and make a brew. You yourself are a good doctor. Living with herbs day and night, even... ...my goat has become somewhat of a doctor. Can't I become then? You can be. Shall I go? - Yes, go. Can I take this stick? Let it be. I'll need it. Father, have your breakfast. - Keep it. Take this pill and this medicine. What to do of that man with the stick? You only go. Give him these medicines... ...and apply this ointment also. Take your stick back and get rid of him. You'll have to only give instead of taking. He hasn't paid for his first ailment... ...and has attracted another on the contrary. He'll give. Take something to eat also. Here. - He's a student. A student. They are the future of the country. Don't know when he'll be the future of the country... ...but right now he is affecting our future. He has caught the stick in such a way... ...he doesn't leave it at all. Oh my God! Do you have to study so many books... ...to become a doctor? What else? This is not village medicine... ...that a person can learn sitting next to his goat. Did you call my father a goat? No, I called the goat your father. I mean... ...you only had told yesterday that if your father sat... ...next to the goat... sorry, the goat sat next to your father... ...then it could learn also. It is not that simple. 300. No, I don't know how many... ...there are species of roots, flowers and herbs. You should be able to recognise each leaf. Only then can a man give medicine. It is not like this. Just read a book and give medicine. Why don't you treat yourself? You too are a doctor. I would have done it. But the medicines I need... ...I do not get them here. Then where do you get them? There in Calcutta. Then you should have fallen there also. Why did you fall here? Do you not get any other stick? No. I'll take this one only. Father had bought it for three rupees. He had not got it from a tree. Hello, Chanda. - Come, come. - Greetings. Greetings. I had forgotten your gait. I didn't see you so many days. Actually I had forgotten my gait. Lay out the plates for him also. Tell me, how is your health now. I am all right now. Also the temperature... ...the fever, that is, has gone down. Chanda! O Chanda! Come here. Come here I say. What is this? You did not greet him? He is your guest. Greetings! - Greetings! Eat. How are studies going on? - Okay. Will you top? I hope to. How many patients will you kill in a year? Some... what? What to worry of those who have to go? Creatures come and go. If they are saved, it is due to... ...the Almighty's blessings. If they die, it's the doctor's doing. Sir, along with wisdom, you also teach me... ...how to make couplets. I'll recite them when I operate. Operation means the cutting up of the body. That's it. I do not like this cutting up in your medicine. Do you also do it? It has to be done in surgery. When has it to be done? In surgery. Surgery. There's no meaning of that. Sir, nowadays technology in surgery is fast developing. Is that so? - Now we can even transplant hearts. Oh! We change hearts also, but by instilling good thoughts. What else? Eat, eat. Did you not like it? No, it is very nice. Whatever little it is, it is at least home-made. Listen, as long as you are here, you are our guest. Give. Why are you taking this stick? I'll give you one. Silent! She is after this stick since ten days, sir. She is not at all concerned about my foot. "This stick... this stick..." "...has stuck around my neck." "This stick... this stick..." "...has stuck around my neck." "Like shackles around the feet, or sometimes like handcuffs." "This stick... this stick..." "...has stuck around my neck." "This stick... this stick..." "...has stuck around my neck." "Give a turn to the straight paths..." "Give a turn to the straight paths..." "...give some solace to disinterested souls..." "...this chain of breath may not cease..." "...this chain of breath may not cease." "This stick... this stick..." "...has stuck around my neck." "This stick... this stick..." "...has stuck around my neck." "This stick... this stick..." "...has stuck around my neck." "This stick... this stick..." "...has stuck around my neck." "Like shackles around the feet, or sometimes like handcuffs." "This stick... this stick..." "...has stuck around my neck." "This stick... this stick..." "...has stuck around my neck." "This stick... this stick..." "...has stuck around my neck." "It seems that some glass is broken in my breath." "It seems that some glass is broken in my breath." "Some strange pain pierces the chest." "I have tied this fiery pain to my veil." "I have tied this fiery pain to my veil." "This stick... this stick..." "...has stuck around my neck." "This stick... this stick..." "...has stuck around my neck." "Like shackles around the feet, or sometimes like handcuffs." "This stick... this stick..." "...has stuck around my neck." "This stick... this stick..." "...has stuck around my neck." "This stick... this stick..." "...has stuck around my neck." Good morning, sir. Good morning. Sorry, Dr. Gill, we have entered your house... ...without your permission. Mr. Mehta, dean of the... ...government hospital. - How do you do? Mr. E. Suratwalla, chief surgeon. - How do you do? And you already know Dr. Kamal Bose. Please sit down. We have come here to invite you for the opening of a clinic. Well gentlemen, thank you for the honour. But I am here on a holiday. I wish to spend these holidays... ...in absolute solitude. We won't take much time, Dr. Gill. It is a very small function. We are opening a clinic in the Blue Valley. We wish that... ...you encourage the young doctors who are leaving... ...the city and beginning their careers in this faraway village. Where are you opening this clinic? In the Blue Valley. When? - Next week, Friday. Okay. - Thank you. You are welcome. Bye doctor. Okay. By the way, dean. Is there a mill there... ...where clothes are made? Yes there is one, a small one. It is not very famous too. The womenfolk of the village work there. There's a better mill at Siliguri It makes better cloth too. Okay. Anyway, I shall reach at 11. We shall come to pick you up. - Okay, bye. The Blue Valley! (Nili Ghati) Come, come. I am looking for a woman named Chanda. She works with you perhaps. Chanda! Yes there is one. She is an old lady. Perhaps yes, she is the one. You wait. I'll call her. Come, come inside, mother. No need to worry. Is she the one? No. Sorry, mother, I troubled you. Go mother. Do your work. She must not have become so old. You know her? Yes. I know her. Then come yourself and see. No. Do you know very well she works here only? Yes, I have heard. Since when are you working here? Since about 10 to 12 years. I am speaking of a time before that. About 20 years ago. Munim, listen. Was a woman named Chanda... ...working here 20 years ago? What name? - Chanda. Isn't that right? I do not remember anything. Did she live here? No, she had come here after marriage in Darjeeling. Her husband was lame. Are you speaking about Langu Harkara? Yes, he's the one. He had married the daughter of some doctor. Yes. Her name is Chanda. She used to work here. In the coloring department. She would colour threads. Her husband had died... ...just one year after her marriage. She had a daughter with Langu. I am searching for them only, Munim sir. Do you know where they are? Where can I meet them? I cannot tell that, sir. It seems to be another life now. But I know that even after the death of Langu... ...she was here for three or four years. She knew the herbs very well. It was in those days only... ...that she went somewhere. Perhaps she went to Dhaulpur. A woman named Chanda in Dhaulpur? Yes. She's a widow. She has a daughter. She had come from the Blue Valley about 15 years ago. She knows herbs well. She knows Ayurveda also. We do not know any woman by this name. Thank you. Darjeeling to the Blue Valley and from there to Dhaulpur. I only know that much. It is difficult to find her like this, sir. How many places have you been to? You do not know the name of her husband... ...you do not know the name of her daughter... ...and the one you know, who knows if she is alive or... No! She is not dead. This cannot be. But will you recognise her if you meet her daughter? I will recognise. If not by the face, then by the voice. The voice will be the same... Of Chanda. "This heart lays in search..." "...once again for those days and nights of leisure..." "This heart lays in search..." "...once again for those days and nights of leisure..." "We remain sitting, waiting when to know..." "This heart lays in search..." "...once again for those days and nights of leisure..." "This heart lays in search once again..." "On seeing the delicate sunshine of the winter..." "...and lying in the courtyard..." "On seeing the delicate sunshine of the winter..." "...and lying in the courtyard..." "Pulling the shade of your coat over my eyes..." "Pulling the shade of your coat over my eyes..." "We lay on our stomachs, tossing and turning." "This heart searches..." "This heart lays in search..." "...once again for those days and nights of leisure..." "This heart lays in search once again..." "When the winds blow in the nights of summer..." "When the winds blow in the nights of summer..." "...we keep awake in cold white sheets until late." "...we keep awake in cold white sheets until late." "We kept staring at the stars lying on terraces..." "This heart searches..." "This heart lays in search..." "...once again for those days and nights of leisure..." "This heart searches once again..." "This heart searches once again..." "...for those days and nights of leisure..." "We keep sitting, not knowing where to go..." "This heart searches once again..." "...for those days and nights of leisure." Excuse me. I need to know the whereabouts of a girl. If you now, then... Whose girl? She's named Chanda. A woman now. She knows herbs well. She had come to stay here... ...from the Blue Valley. She has a child also. She's a widow. Thapa the doctor's daughter? Yes, she's the one. Where is she? She was. She was a very nice girl. Was? Does that mean she isn't now? No. She went from here. It is many years now... ...she used to collect herbs and bring and then sell them... ...in the bazaar. She used to prescribe medicines also. She had suffered many torturous days. Don't know how she got an idea in her mind! She would tell of going to the city... ...and educate her daughter to become a doctor. But the wretched woman was ruined by her own self. What had happened to her? Where is she gone? Who knows who he was? Dhanu or somebody. Don't know what his name was. Perhaps he was... ...her husband's brother. Less of a brother... ...more of a slaughterer. He would take whatever... ...she would earn. He tried to keep her forcibly in his house. He would threaten to kidnap the girl and take her away. She was getting insulted due to him. She had just one folly. She would mutter to herself. She would speak to herself only. But she was fond of making medicines. If I would tell her the medicine for her asthmatic problem... ...she would tell me her own prescriptions. She would tell to put all the seven salts in some leaf... Where has she gone now? I'll tell. Let me finish what I am saying. Here. Jodha... Jodh... - Jodhpal. Yes. Here, you see this. She had written this here. It is her handwriting. Contractor Jodhpal, Pili Kothi, Siliguri. This is the Pili Kothi. But it has been sold since 2 years. Where does the contractor Jodhpal stay nowadays? He has retired now. He stays in Calcutta only. There was a woman named Chanda. I have come from very far to search for her. Please tell me where I can find her. There's a gardener living behind the cottage. Meet him and ask. He was taking care of that mad one. Mad? Yes. The elder one had lost her senses and the younger... You meet him only and ask. He'll tell you. Can I get a glass of water? Yes, definitely. You do not seem to be well, sir. Here. A mad woman stayed here. Chanda. - Yes. Can you tell me anything about her? She's not here anymore, sir. She died. When? It is eight months. How did she die? What had happened? It is a very sad tale, sir. I would just hear and weep. In her last days, she had lost all her senses. She would run here and there in her madness. If she would see a book in anyone's hands... ...she would hold their hand and ask them... ...if their exams were over. Are the exams over? Have you become a doctor? When you become a doctor... ...you marry my daughter. Teach her also. Her also... Sir... Sir... She has lived her life in misery. There was an old overcoat. She would wear that. She also had a stick in her hand. She used to tell... ...to burn the stick along with her on her funeral pyre. And Kajli? What happened to her? No news from her since she went to the city. She would send some money for her mother... ...every month or two. She had sent the message that... ...she had got a good job and she was still studying. When she becomes a doctor, she will come... ...and treat her mother herself. - Do you know her whereabouts? She never sent any. Does she know that Chanda is dead? Yes. I had sent a message with the person... ...who used to bring the money. When the money stopped... ...I understood that she must have got the news. She would make Kajli wear this and look at her. And this... she had told Kajli that she would give it to her... ...when she became a doctor. Don't know where she got it from. Can I keep this too? Yes, keep it too. Listen, give me that box. It is that same thing, perhaps. - What, sir? I had given her a white necklace. Of ivory? I have seen it. She told Kajli that... ...she would give it to her as dowry. It wasn't of ivory. I had lied to her and she began arguing. That time, I was preparing to return to the city. It is very beautiful. Is it ivory? - Yes. How much is it of? - Of 715 rupees. What happened? How do you have so much money? - That... There were 128 rupees in it. Only 60 are left now. Where are the rest? I have kept those sixty for returning to the city. Don't touch them. Why did you touch them? There were 128 rupees here. How many days have passed since I kept them? Don't I have any expense? What expense do you have? You eat for free. I wash your clothes. You get milk twice in a day. That's all. And this necklace of 45 rupees? Does the pundit... ...in the temple distribute them? Is it of 45 rupees? Doesn't it seem to be so? That it does. Give me the remaining money. What money is left? I spent 50 paise on tea... ...and 50 paise for the rickshaw. Tea? Had you drunk in a bucket? Not drunk, but bathed in it. What is this? Show. Hey... 58 rupees. - Isn't it a good photo? How did these come? Tell me how much this is of. You'll have to swear on me. No, no. This box, it is of three rupees. And this necklace? - Of 75 paise. I do not want a necklace of 75 paise. Am I a beggar? Great! So long as it was of 45 rupees, it was nice. Now that it is of 75 paise, it is bad? Princess Chanda, it is the same necklace. Is a 75 paise necklace a necklace? What if the necklace is of 75 paise? The heart is not of 75 paise. Take your hand away. - What happened? Do not rub your ears. It becomes septic. What does it become? - Septic. Look, you forget this medicine. You'll simply kill some patient. You become a doctor. I'll leave then. What will be the delay in my becoming a doctor? Just about ten days. I'll go next Tuesday... ...there will be the exams on Wednesday. What will be there? - Exams! Examination. Didn't you say that you will get something? Yes, a first class degree. After that I can kill anyone. When will you speak to father? You are going on Tuesday. Now five days is remain. I'll speak tomorrow itself. What will you tell him? I'll tell I want to marry Chanda and take her with me. Will you not give me time to make the preparations? If I just send her like that, she will think I only... ...washed my hands off my responsibility. No, my son. Not like this. I'm fortunate that Chanda is born in my house. You are also fortunate that she is going to your house. When such a goddess of wealth enters someone's home... Go, son, go. I am obliged to you. Whenever you shall come, I shall return your wealth to you. Go. That was the last time I saw Chanda. I thought that this journey will take me back to Chanda... ...in a few weeks, but it extended to many years. I committed a very big mistake. It's result would be this, I never imagined. I should have returned. I should have returned. Yes please. - Do you have aspirin? Can I give you Gill's tablets? They are very effective. You'll get relief soon. No, brother. They have more chlorine, less medicine. Give me aspirin only. As you wish. Scoundrel, rascal, will you sit here the whole night... ...for ten rupees? Is this your house? If you come here again, I shall cut you up and... ...feed you to the crows. I shall... Give me my slippers. Take these. And beat your wife with them. Where do they come from? What are you seeing, sir? If you want to have fun... ...come upstairs. Or else, go away. Come on, Kajli. Why are you spoiling business? Only God can understand your anger. Sir, aspirin. Take your aspirin. What are you embroiling yourself into, sir? This happens here every night. This girl... who is this girl? She is a prostitute, sir. Didn't you hear her language? Such foul words! You can hear such dirty language here that... ...a gentleman would go home and wash his ears. Three rupees. Your balance, sir. Does some girl named Kajli live here? I want to meet her. She is resting now; a customer has just left. She is tired. Will someone else do? - I have some work with her. Everyone has the same work. Come. Get up. - Who is it? - Go inside and sleep. Sit. Kajli, get up. Someone has come for you. Get up. Let me sleep, auntie. How much will you make me toil? Get up, child. He seems to be a very rich man. If he was a pauper, I myself would have shooed him off. I do not think he will sit. He'll have fun you and go away. Meet him. And do not agree to anything less than 30 or 40. Hey sir, you were so late in coming. I am yawning. Sit. Will you have something to drink? No whisky. But I have country beer, like myself. Will it do? No, daughter. I just came to meet you. Why do you call me daughter? Just come down to business. I have come here with some other work, daughter. Don't tell daughter. I have heard lot of this. Tell me if you want to sit. What is your name? What will you do with my name? Do you want... ...to take me home? Why know about my ancestors? My mother was mad, my father was lame. Want to ask something more? Why are you getting angry, daughter? Auntie... auntie... Listen to me. You only take care of this old man. He has come to adopt me. What happened? Come on inside. Is Kajli there? Kajli... See your old man has come. Go. Go. So you came back? Listen to what I have to say, daughter. Daughter again? Go. Get out. Go away. Where do these people come from? These people... What is it? What do you want now? I want Kajli. I have whisky. I need soda. Can I get it? So you have come on the right path. Come. Sit. I'll bring the soda. What is it? What is your name? - Paro. Will you take some whisky, sir? - No. So you too are bonkers for Kajli! She is quite an item. Once you are addicted to her, you can have no one else. Husain, did you like anyone? None from this lot. - Then go inside. Go. Come on, let's play poker. Do you have money? - Certainly. Can I come also? - Be seated there. It is strictly cash here. Here, this is mine. Distribute for me. I'll come just now. - Come soon. Is there any place to sit separately? Yes. It will take Rs. 5 more. Doesn't matter. - Come on. Bring the soda. Go, sir. Go. Sit down. Since when do you drink? Since I am in this job. The one who would come earlier... ...used to give me forcibly. Now it has become a habit. If I don't drink, I cannot sleep. You didn't touch the glasses. Cheers! What did you say? Nothing. Kajli! What is it, auntie? - Listen. Will he sit the whole night or go? I don't know. - Ask him. Why? - Chawdhary has come. He doesn't go to anyone... ...but you. What do I do, auntie? He's sitting. Tell him... ...someone took me outside. Come on, why are you fretting. Chawdhary, she is sitting with a client. Let me show. Chawdhary! What are you doing? It's a very rich client you have trapped. You sit with him Kajli. I shall deal with him. Come on with me. - What will you take? Many people come here. Some days many people come here. But on some other days... ...it is so empty here, do not even ask about them. People do not come here even to just drink. But that Gangu Rani, she takes good care of the girls. Just like a mother she treats them. Drink. You are very slow. What's the hurry? Will you stay the whole night? Yes. Do you go out also? Yes. If he is atrustworthy man, Gangu Rani sends me. What does trustworthy mean? Gangu Rani looks at the man and understands. She has seen in a lot in life. Will she send you with me? It appears so. Not for just one night. For many days. Out of the city? No, in this city only. As long as I am in this city. I understand. I have also seen life. But it will cost a lot. Do not worry about money. I will give as much as you ask. But you will have to stay with me where I tell you. Agreed. Okay. Tell me, from when. From today. How much will you take? Tell me. Shall I call Gangu Rani? You'll give an advance. No drugs. Call her. You sleep. Dinner, sir? I have eaten. You sleep. Turn off the lights. Where are we? Good morning, sir. - Good morning. Keep the tea outside in the lawn. Good morning, sir. - Good morning. I waited for you till late at night. Yes, I was delayed. Those papers which have come from the office... ...I have signed them and kept. You can take them and return. Take Dhyan Singh also with you. I shall not need him. Tell in the office not todisturb me at all these vacations. I do not know when I shall return. Tell Kiran to mind the business. Do you want to ask anything? - No. You woke up? - Yes. I got much drunk last night. You go. Make preparations for your return. This whisky is a very miserable thing. Look, do not swear. I have sworn at whisky, not you. It may be for the whisky; but girls don't look good cussing. Whether it is a boy or a girl, a swear word is a swear word. What is good in that? Let us get some new clothes for you today. I have some. They are in the box. Even then, let me buy some more. - Buy them. What loss it is to me? But do not cut it from my fees. You are good at business. What else? If you have to sell your body to live... ...then you'll know. What are you doing? - What? Why are you smoking a beedi? I smoke beedi. That may be. But is it a problem if you... ...do not smoke here in front of everybody? Look friend, this will be very difficult. You've paid me... ...but do not boss on me as if I am your wife. Do not smoke; do not swear; don't do this; don't do that. For what you have paid me, that I know and you know too. Look, if you feel so much like smoking, then go inside. Outside there are servants. People look. If you keep my respect among them, it will be a favour. Otherwise, let's bathe and go out. Where do I refuse there? I get humiliated very much with a respectable man. Sir, you have a trunk call from Calcutta. Hello. Speak Kiran. I am all right. I have money. I'll ask if I need. And listen... I am sending Mathur and Kiran back. Oh, don't you bother... ...and don't bother me also. What? Okay, you sign it. Okay. Sorry sir. I had to disturb you in the morning. I'm going back today. I thought of meeting you. If you need anything from Calcutta, you can tell me. Sir... Sir... - What is it? Where is the box of my clothes? In my drunkenness, I lost my wits only. It is outside in the car. Tell the driver. He'll remove it. So, when are you going? I thought of meeting you. - Will you have tea? - No, I'll go now. I wouldn't want to disturb you much. Have a good time, sir. I got it. It was in the car. Did you have to ask now only? - What happened? Don't you have anything else to wear? Like some saris? You go, get ready. We'll go to the bazaar. Look, how beautiful you look like this. Unnecessarily you put all the makeup. You speak like a lover. No one has told me this before. Can't you speak without calling names? If you feel bad, I shan't say so, my friend. Wear one of these saris. Which one will you wear? The one that you like. You wear it. I'll go outside. Why do you go out? I shall wear it in front of you, friend. Won't you feel ashamed to change in front of me? Your daughter may get ashamed. Why should I? People spend so much money for the body. Will it always remain like this? I was going to call you a name. You wear. I'll go outside. I understood you. - What? - You are another type of man. Another type? Yes, the romantic. They keep girls only for roaming... ...drinking and dancing. Isn't that true? Yes. I am that other type of man. But you have committed a mistake. - What? It would have been better if you'd have chosen Champa. She dances quite well. She taught me, but I didn't learn. But I'll show you. - Okay. Wear the sari. "I sway a lot in my love... My lover, get aside... get aside..." "I sway a lot in my love... My lover, get aside... get aside..." "If I wink..." What is this? What is happening? "If I wink, you shall fall, my lover..." Oh no! "My lover, get aside, get aside, get aside..." "I sway a lot in my love... My lover, get aside... get aside..." "I sway a lot in my love... My lover, get aside... get aside..." "My waist is so thin..." "My waist is so thin..." "...and on that thin waist I have tied a pot..." "My lover, get aside, get aside, get aside..." "I sway a lot in my love... My lover, get aside... get aside..." "I sway a lot in my love... My lover, get aside... get aside..." What happened? Do you feel dizzy? Yes, a little. Enough! You've done too much. Didn't you like it? - It's nice. It's very nice. "The intoxication of alcohol on the peach colour..." "The intoxication of alcohol on the peach colour..." "My lover has spoiled my habits..." "My lover, get aside, get aside, get aside..." "I sway a lot in my love... My lover, get aside... get aside..." "If I wink..." Enough, Kajli. I am doing this for you. You are spending so much on me. Do not worry about my money. I have a lot of it. Ask how much you want. What do I want to do? If I get for my food and booze, enough. What else? Will you drink some? No. Not today. Are you sick? No. Is it necessary man should drink daily. I'll not be able to drink, friend. Try abstaining for one day. You will make me go out of business. When I was not doing all this, someone used to come... ...and make me do all this forcibly. But now... ...somehow you have come. Why did you not come then? When? When I was young. I could not come then. I am repenting for that now. But if you'd have come then, we would not have gelled. Why? - But you would have gelled with my mother... ...because she was also very beautiful. What was your mother doing? She was just dying. She kept dying for twenty years. For some scoundrel of a doctor. But don't remind me of all that. Do not ever talk of my family. I'll warn you against that now only. I do not feel naked sitting among naked people now... ...but I do feel ashamed among respectable folk. I can then see my nakedness. You only had gone and sat in nakedness. Come back to where you had gone from. Do you not know of the cobbler... ...who spent a lifetime working in leather? The day he passed by a perfumery, he fainted. He had gone there after many days; that's why. If he goes there daily, then he will not faint. It isn't needed at all. If one feels... ...naked going somewhere, why should they go there? I will have to travel to the market of perfumes so many... ...times, you will forget the stench of leather. You must have gone to some other paths too. Not all the time... - Sir... this was left in the both room. This... is this yours? Yes. Why do you wear this coral. Someone had given it to me. Who had? Some one. - Is he not there any longer? He is there. I don't know how and where he is. What is his name? Kundan. Do you want to search for him? Do you? Why are you worried about my life? Do you want some alcohol? Shall I bring the glass? I look dignified with you now, isn't it? There is something. You are a good man. But you are useless for me. - What do you mean? Have you kept a woman for the first time? Yes. Never married? No. Why? It was a long time ago. I loved a woman. I wanted to come back and marry her. But... in those days... A man was killed at my hands during an operation. Are you a doctor? No. A surgeon. There was a police case, and I was jailed for three years. Because of that shame, I didn't tell her anything. I didn't come back, and neither did I marry. Don't scratch your ears. They get poisoned. Don't scratch your ears. They get poisoned. Who told you that if you itch your ears, they get poisoned? Mother. Mother told it to me. In my childhood. Where are we going? The blue valley. Have you ever gone there? Yes, in my childhood. How is the place? I just remember two places. One is the company, mother used to work there. And the hospital, where mother used to take me to. Why? She used to tell the doctors to make me a doctor. Then? Then what. Does anyone want a doctor without studying? If you wish, you can continue your studies. You can become doctor. Should I tell you something? I hate the word doctor. I don't hate that man as much who made me... ...a prostitute, as much as I hate that doctor... ...because of whom my mother went crazy. If I would meet him once in this life... Then? What would you do? Even I don't know what I'd do. I just know that whatever I'd do would be very bad. Rascal! Wretch! - Oh god... Get lost from here. Get lost. - No, I won't... I won't... What is going on? Why are you two fighting? Dare he hit me! I will wreck his entire family. I will... - Silent, Kajli. What is the matter? Sir, I told her not to come in the kitchen. But she didn't listen to me. Who are you to refuse me? Is this your father's house? See, sir... when I told her to go out of the kitchen... ...she abused me on my mother. Why did you send her separate? See, sir... I have been silent till today because of you. Otherwise, you know it very well. I cannot eat anything that she touches. If you can eat it, please have her cook it. I will have her cook it. Go away from here. This is not correct, sir. A respectable man like you... You don't have to worry about my respect. I will take care of my own respect. Please leave. Come with me. I threw the cook away. To hell with the wretch. And which wretch will cook the good? I will cook the food, don't I know how to? Eat it and see. You will forget this wretch. Is it? Okay. Bring it. Come on. Are you going to Dholpur? Yes. I think that is the name of that place. What work do you have there? I want to search for a man there. What is the name of that person? Kundan. - Why? - I have some work. What is the work? Not me, but you can have some work with him. No, I don't have any work, I don't want to meet him. You loved Kundan, isn't it? Yes, so? What if Kundan is still waiting for you? Nobody waits for anybody for so long. Didn't your mother wait for a doctor? Twenty years. It isn't wrong to meet him once. I am not worthy of him anymore now. And I will not hide anything from him too. It is possible that the doctor thought like this... ...and he didn't return too. If that doctor returned... wouldn't your mother forgive him? Yes? Kundan... Kundan stayed here, isn't it? Yes, he stays here... I... I... I wanted to meet him. He has gone out for some work. Tell me. I am his wife. So... he has married... Can I tell you something, Kajli? Why don't you marry someone too? Someone nice... - Who lets anyone remain nice? No woman is a born prostitute. You get people to make them. I have got also. - Who? Dinu, my father's brother. He used to regard me as his daughter and... Where was your mother at that time? Mother was crazy by that time. Already crazy. "The baton... how did it stick to the neck?" You have become crazy, Chanda. Mother, go inside. Dinu... Why did you come once again? I am your father's brother. Regard me as your uncle. How can you speak to me like this? I have seen your brotherhood. I have told you so many times. You don't need to come here anymore. Even if I do come, I come to see your well being. See, I have spoken to the doctor upstairs. Take Chanda and have her admitted. I don't want to send mother to a mental asylum. I will have her cured. Uncle Moti... - Yes? Uncle, I am going to get medicine for mother. Please take care of her. - What is all this? When Kajli becomes a bride, I will have her wear this. I can make her a bride tomorrow. But she should agree, isn't it? How will you have her married now? Are you crazy? Let her become a doctor. When she becomes a doctor... I will give her this... I will give her this... You have ruined your life for some doctor. He must have died a long time ago. Kajli... hey, did Kajli go to get the medicines? She has gone to the school, to become a doctor. What is the work? The landlord has called her. Send her when she returns. That landlord! Till when will he save her? I'll see! If I cannot do it right away... You? What are you doing here? What do you want? While I was unconscious, he took me to the city. The dark room... and... and... I was sold the day I saw brightness. At Gangurani's courtesan hall. What did you do? If I was with my Kajli at that time... Good morning. Good morning. Yes... thank you. You woke up early in the morning? My days and nights have changed due to you. I sleep early in the night, and wake up quickly in the day. I felt like praying today in the morning. You should have done it. Do you know how to? I didn't learn it at all. Here... - You have it. - Take this. No. I had it lighted for you. You will not have it? No. You don't like it. Therefore... I thought that I'd not have it in your presence. That means, you will have it if I am not around. What? Nothing, I forgot. You will not be with me forever. And if I tell you that I will be with you forever. I want to keep you with me forever, then? It is good for the number of days that you are with me. Don't promise me forever. I am scared of such promises. Someone had promised my mother this once upon a time. And I had promised someone the second time. Now... There was so much money here. Where is it? The wallet too... yes... I found them. There was so much money... now, there are just this much. If you spend them like this, you won't have any to return. Shall I keep some of them, carefully? Kajli... many years ago, a woman saved my money like this. Even at that time, she kept sixty rupees for my return. If she wouldn't keep it, if I wouldn't go... then... then... I am feeling very strange. When Kundan was here many years ago, I felt like this. Did you say something? - No. Where had you gone? Are you still angry with me? I committed a mistake, forgive me. I have come to take my clothes. You will not get them. You will not get your clothes, salary or holiday. Nothing! See, this house is yours, and the owner of this house too. I don't have anything here. Nor the employer nor the house. He has kept you to look after the house. You look after it. You don't know why and how we are kept? Nobody gives us houses. Then why have you come here? To trouble a dignified man? I had come here for my business. And I forgot it. I started looking at him like a woman. I don't know... how this took birth within me. Uncle... uncle... please come back... I will go tomorrow. Your employer won't lose anything. I won't be worth anywhere. Neither the house... nor... Who has come at this time? Get up, see. You? Come... come inside... Have a seat. Tell me. Why did you come here at this time? Your previous money hasn't finished as yet. I wanted to speak about something. Therefore... I don't know how to tell this to you. Do you want to change the girl? Are you tired of Kajli? You will not understand. It is like this... Kajli is from a good house. I want to take her out from here. Sir... nobody is good in this. All of them are whores. Yes, they do nice business. Do your work, and return the seeds to us. Don't try to sow them. How much do you earn from Kajli? How much will you earn from her? And till when will you earn from her? Five years? Ten years? Fifteen years? Take all the money that you can earn from here. From me. Has Kajli sent you? - She doesn't know about this. I didn't even tell her this. And I don't know how I will tell her about this. Don't be crazy, sir. This is not the market of sheep. My daughters live here. You can sell your daughters. I don't sell them. They are not saleable. Such a amount, which you must have just heard... ...but never seen in your life, fill it. I will give it to you. But give Kajli to me. I will wait for your answer. "These halted steps..." "They stop and then move ahead..." "These halted steps..." "They stop and then move ahead..." "At peace..." "...they become restless again." "These halted steps..." "They stop and then move ahead..." "These halted steps..." "The morning didn't come... I woke many times from my sleep." "The morning didn't come... I woke many times from my sleep." "I spent this whole life in a night once again." "I spent this whole life in a night once again." "These halted steps..." "I had the gratitude of the heart on my bosom..." "I had the gratitude of the heart on my bosom..." "I repaid this debt to you too." "I repaid this debt to you too." "At peace, they become restless again." "These halted steps..." "They stop and then move ahead..." "These halted steps..." What is this that you are wearing? Clothes. I wear them all the time. What is so surprising in this? Get up. Get up and change your clothes. See, don't order me around like a husband. I am not your wife. What is wrong with these clothes? You look vulgar in these clothes. It seems... these clothes look so cheap. Don't you know where you have brought me from? See, I don't want to argue with you. Just change your clothes. Haven't you heard that phrase? The crow tries to walk like a duck. I had forgotten my business. I had gone to business today therefore... Where had you gone? To my client. That Chaudhary. Do you remember? That day... He had come... Why did you go? Why did you go out? What do you lack here? What do you lack here? You want money, isn't it? Don't I give you money? Don't you get money for your time? I know. This is the time that you have bought. I will not betray you. I got these. Keep them. Get lost. Get lost from here. Nothing can be done to you. I cannot do anything. You have come from the dirt. You will remain in the dirt. Mangal, give her all her belongings. What is the matter? Tell me. Nothing. Nothing at all. I forgot my way. Inside me... inside me... a woman is still alive. I thought, she had died a long time ago. But she is alive. I wish to be a mother, Champa. I wish to be a mother. Has our Banno returned? Where is Kajjo? Come... come... have you returned from your in-laws? Come on, get up and sit there. You look so nice in this saree. That old man made you a bride. Anyone would take you home. Come on. Sit on the chair. The new one for nine days, and the old one for a hundred days. I am your lover since so many years now. He is here today, he will go tomorrow. And I... I will be here with you forever. I have heard it, come on... get up. That pimp has made you so arrogant. You must be the pimp. Your father doesn't feed him. Don't you dare abuse him. A woman worth two bits. She slaps me? What did you say? Get lost from here... Will you hit me? Will you? Come on! What happened? He was abusing. Whom? Him. With whom I stay nowadays. Is he your husband? No. I am not related to him. But who is Chaudhary to abuse him? But why did you feel so bad? I never saw you so angry ever before. I never met anyone before this too. Nobody gave me such dignity too. For the first time, someone saw me like a woman. Not like a courtesan. He didn't even touch me till now. Aunty, he really loves me. I can't tolerate his love. Kajli, does he love you... ...or do you love him? Even you have changed a lot. See, child... The steps of these halls don't lead to any house. I have never seen any woman settle... ...down after leaving these courtesan halls. I haven't seen such guts in any man. Whoever comes, comes all excited. When the excitement is over... But for the first time... I saw a man to be so truthful. Such truth in his words... That old man... with whom you reside. He came to me too. To pay for you. He came here? Yes. And he gave me this blank cheque. Told me to write off anything in it. This hasn't happened ever in life, child. But even if one person does it once out of millions... ...I will think that you and I have done our duty. If he takes you as his own, go. Go away. I don't want anything, I don't want anything at all. Champa, should I go? Should I go away? Once... just once... I want to be a complete woman... I don't want to be incomplete... I don't want to be incomplete... Who? Who is it? Your Kajli... You? Why have you come here? What have you come here for now? To love you. To give myself to you. Have you seen anything ahead of this body? Thought about it? Recognized it? Did your mother give birth to you for this day? Did she give birth to you for this market? It is good that Chanda went away before all this. Chanda? If she wasn't mad for that doctor... ...she would have been mad for you. You would have made her mad. Chanda wanted to make you this? She wanted to see you like this? You know this, isn't it? Don't you recognize it? This... all this... these veils, this vermillion... Don't you know all this? She accumulated dowry even in... ...her madness to see you as a bride. And you... You want to ask who I am, isn't it? I am that same doctor. Dr. Amar Nath. You want to avenge your mother from him. Tell me. What do you want in revenge? Tell me! No... No... No... Mangal... - Yes, sir? Here... Why did you come back? Do you want something from me? What do you have in your hand? What are you hiding? Show me... Him... you are the one, isn't it? You made my mother wait for twenty years? You are the one, for whom my mother went crazy? For whom her whole life was ruined. Neither did she survive, and nor me. Even I was sold in the market for you. It is your fault. It is your fault. Mother will never forgive you. She will never forgive you. Yes, child. Chanda will never forgive me. But my Kajli can forgive me? I know. I have erred. I am a sinner. Therefore, I came to you repeatedly. To ask for my repentance from you, child. Please forgive me, child... Will you come with me? We don't have anything to turn and look back, child. Come with me... come on...
