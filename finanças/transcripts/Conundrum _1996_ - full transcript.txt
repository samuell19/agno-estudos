( Creaking sound ) Rose! Back door's a piece of cake. Give me 60 rutabagas. Yeah. Hey, make it 30. Man: I'm sorry! ( Indistinct comment ) Four rutabaga... Five rutabaga... Ha ha ha! ( Speaking Chinese ) Fifteen rutabagas... Sixteen rutabagas... ( Speaking Chinese ) Ha ha ha! I'm sorry? ( Speaking Chinese ) Joey! Joey! Stop it, for god's sake! What's the old man gonna say if you kill the sucker? Twenty-three rutabagas... ( Joey laughing ) Thirty fucking rutabagas. Police! Freeze! Ohh! ( Onlookers chattering ) ( Tires screech ) So, what the hell you doing here? Joey made me. I didn't want to do it, but... ( Gasping ) Get out. Just go. Get out. Linh, leave the money. ( Door opens ) Shithead got away. What happened to him? Think his ticker shut down. Gonna need paramedics. ( Cabinet door opens ) ( Siren wails ) Man: Right. There we go. We didn't call homicide, mulvaney. Wasted your time. All right, I'll tell you what. Why don't you take her downtown? Guy's still kicking. Not surprising, Rose. Thought anybody'd get stiff around you. ( Rose sighs ) She see anything? If she did, she ain't saying. All right, let's have it. All right, tam's kid, Joey, came by to collect the weekly donation. Apparently the owner is a guy named chu, and he's in arrears. Joey knocked him around, and the guy had a coronary. So far, nobody's seen nothing, but I'll keep knocking. Thattaboy, sheck. Who's in the car? Victim's wife. We found her hiding in the cabinet. She a witness? Doubt it. Keeps saying... ( Speaking Chinese ) What the hell's that mean? It means there's no happiness in going to court. I hear that! ( Woman weeping ) I'm outta here. All right. Sorry, Ekberg. Didn't mean to touch you. Kiss my ass. I would, but I can't afford to lose my pension. Hey, it's been four years. Why don't you leave her alone? Tenacity is my strong suit. ( Brass bell tinkles ) Buzz it. ( Lock buzzes ) ( Camera shutter clicking ) Oh, hey! You got my money? What the hell you doing, huh? Beating up that old man. I told you, I had no choice! Oh, and if he bites it, we'll have no choice but to tank you for murder one! What are you talking about? What murder? Well, the guy had a heart attack. Aww, shit! Aw, take your finger out of your mouth. What about Joey? You got him, right? It's not Joey that we want! You let him get away? Just watch your mouth. You're supposed to be delivering Tony, not his asshole kid. So far, you've been a real disappointment. What about the chicken factory? The chicken factory's crap. We've been sitting on it for three days. Nothing's happened. He'll show, you'll see! What I see is you getting your fingers inked down at central booking. Turn around. Come on! Hold on, Rose. I know a way our boy can redeem himself. What are you talking about? Word's out on the street that Tony's running a game. You know anything about it? Lucky nine. Pai gow, maybe. You remember why you're on the street, don't you, linh? 'Cause I cut you a break, right? A way in. That's all we're asking, linh. I can't! They don't trust me already. They're gonna trust you a lot less, I spread the word you been snitchin'. You wouldn't do that. ( Scoffs ) You don't think so, huh? Tomorrow, I need to know everything. ( Rose sighs ) God, I hope I didn't screw up, letting chow walk, I mean. Let a guy walk once. Dirt bag like chow, in Vietnam. Figured I'd get more mileage out of him being a snitch than a collar. What happened? Got the shit kicked out of me! ( Laughing ) You never told me about that! Well, you're my partner, not my shrink. You mean they're not the same thing? You want to come in for a beer or something? Nah, I gotta Polish my tiara. Mel Gibson's taking me dancing. ( Chuckles ) Okay. You know, this thing with chow, it'll work itself out. You'll see. Yeah. There goes my good night kiss. You know. See you. 'Bye. Hi, honey. This is Carly Ekberg reporting from Athens, Georgia. Well, here we are, my new digs. You know, it's actually bigger than a regular trailer. Maybe that's probably why they call it double wides. Hmm. Well, our basic living room. My basic dad. Dad, you gonna wake up and say a couple of words? Dad? ( Toddler babbling ) Carly: I'll take that as a no! ( Toddler babbling ) Hello, Roy! Hello! What's the matter? Hello! Hello! There's my wicked stepmother. ( Laughing ) Moving right along... To the kitchen. It's a laundry room! And... this is my room. I have a waterbed, a TV, a stereo, and a lava lamp that I got for $3 at a garage sale. Well, that's about it. You know, it's not really bad here. Dad comes home at a normal time. We actually eat dinner together and stuff, just like you said we would. I know you think it's gonna be good for me, and making my grades better and stuff, and I know you thought that you couldn't give me enough time because of your job, but I just want you to know that I really, really, really, really, really, really miss you. ( Tape rewinding ) This is Carly Ekberg, reporting from Athens, Georgia. Well, here we are... 'Morning, Ted. 'Morning. Tell Julie I'm here, will you? Yep. Remind her we've got a faculty meeting in 20 minutes. You got it. Thanks. Cover yourselves. I'm in. Hello? Oh. Good morning. 'Morning. Where's your hubby? Oh, still primping. ( Shouting ) And improve perfection, horak! Let's go! You've got to stir with a fork. This was our last spoon. ( Car horn toots ) Oh, your ride's here. Ah, he'll wait. When was the last time you guys ate at home? Why? Everything in your fridge is wearing angora. No point cooking for a man who eats all his meals with you. Uh... ( Coughs ) You okay? Yeah. What time you finish up tonight? I don't know. Why? Thought I'd chill some champagne. Oh, champagne. 'Course, uh, we aren't allowed to have any. What, you're pregnant? ( Laughing ) Really? Oh, that's so great! ( Indistinct happy chatter ) Hey, what's all the racket? Hey! I'm pissed at you, man! You're holding out on me! What? What? The baby! ( Car horn toots ) I thought we'd decided that we weren't going to... I'd better go. Don't want the neighbors complaining. ( Car horn toots ) Let's go, daddy. All right. Julie. Horak! Are you coming or are you cooping? ( Car engine starts ) Hey. Anything new? Yeah. I've become a vegetarian. Where's the Van? It's out front. Okay. You on this afternoon? Double shift. Bet your old man loves that. Yeah, he's talking divorce, on the grounds I've been "plucking" around. Slaughterhouse humor. She has been here too long. See ya. 'Bye. Nice. ( Distant locomotive whistle blowing ) Where the hell is he? Here. Have your burrito. You have it. I go to the trouble of picking up your breakfast, and you cannot bother to eat it. What the hell are you doing? Oh, god, this is nuts, you know? I should be hassling my kid about eating her breakfast, not my friggin' partner. Come on, Rose. You should be paying less attention to this job and more attention to your wife. Why, did Julie say something? No, it's... Not what she said, it's just how she said it. What do you mean? ( Scoffs ) You know, you're so oblivious to what a woman needs. She could have her legs wrapped around your head, and you'd think she was trying to keep your ears warm. Here, at least drink your milk. All right, all right. Julie gonna quit teaching when the baby comes? I don't know. We haven't really talked about it. ( Chuckles ) Now why doesn't that surprise me? Well, she ought to quit. Hadn't been for this job, I'd probably still be married, and I know that Carly would be with me. I thought moving to Atlanta was her idea. Well, it was. It... Oh... forget it. There's the little prick now. Punch his code six. ( Onboard computer beeps ) Stash! What's going on here? Horak don't like the pictures I took for him. What I don't like is getting fucked around with. We're not interested in your photos anymore, linh. We know who the dirt bags are. The question is, how do we take 'em down? Talk to me, man. Did you find a way to Joey's game, or not? It's gonna cost you another "c" note. Ohh! All right, all right! Jesus! Tam's got a bolt hole. A what? A tunnel, from under his club. Goes to a factory or something, couple of blocks away. Who else knows about it? Nobody. I wouldn't have known except Joey was bragging about how smart his old man is. And when's Tony gonna be there? Picks up the week's receipts Saturday, around three. Tony himself? Tony, Joey. Don't trust nobody else. You're sure about that? Guaranteed. Better be. It's a bad idea, stash. It's just a conversation, Rose, no big deal. ( Indistinct chatter ) ( Brass bell tinkles ) I'd like a word with you. I'm in the middle of a game. Oh, yeah. Now, be nice. Where's Joey? You know children... so independent these days. A warrant has been issued for his arrest. A mistake, I'm sure. Yeah? Why don't you tell that to the old man he whaled on. If you hear from him, I want you to contact me. Detective, uh, horak... Someone will have to pay for the mess you've made. ( Objects clatter ) ( Speaking Chinese ) ( Brass bell tinkles ) ( Rock music playing ) ...for letting chow waltz, and then you pull this tough-guy shit on tam, of all people. I mean, I keep telling you, making this case is a dangerous game, and you've got to be doubly careful now that you've got some responsibility! ( Cheering ) ( Indistinct happy chatter ) Hey, man! Didn't think you ahd it in you, man! A toast. One good shot deserves another! There you go! To papa. ( Indistinct happy chatter ) You're responsible for this? No! Not at all! ( Laughing ) Liar! Ah. I think I'd better go call my wife and let her know I'm gonna be a little bit late. ( Laughter ) Be right back. Make it a double. We celebrate tonight, all right? ( Music continuing ) Hey, how you doing? Can I get a double shot of scotch and a port? Thanks. Tony tam filed a complaint against your partner. News to me. Too bad it didn't include you, huh? Be poetic, wouldn't it? Being charged with harassment. Jesus Christ! Give me a break, will you, please? Like you gave Danny Cole, huh? Your dirtball friend tried to use the job to get into my pants. Oh, come on, Ekberg, you weren't born yesterday. You should have dealt with it yourself. ...keep me from making detective if I didn't sleep with him! You didn't have to file. You're right, I could have kept my mouth shut and let him screw me, but instead I let him fuck himself! Rose, please, let's party. ( Indistinct comment ) Here. You know, I... I don't need you to protect me, okay? I wasn't protecting you. Think I can't figure out, Ekberg, is why Danny wanted you in the first place. Nobody else does. I was protecting mulvaney. ( Laughing ) Hey, hey. Let's dance, for father's day, all right? Come on! All right, for father's day. ( Soulful ballad plays ) Miss. Female vocalist: ♪ Underground ♪ brighter star ♪ shine down on me ♪ light the way ♪ for all to see ♪ I can't live alone ♪ I'll find someone else ♪ can't leave my love ♪ out here on the shelf ♪ so come to me soon ♪ under the lazy moon watch yourself, Rose. Guy's obviously got a way with women. ♪ I know you'll ♪ take your time... I'm gonna go. You sure? Yeah. Thanks for the dance. ( Telephone rings ) ( Message machine beeps ) Horak: Hey, Rose, it's Fred Astaire. Don't bother to pick me up, I've got a dentist appointment. Be in by one. ( Beep ) It's me. Tam's gonna hit the packing plant, today, sometime this afternoon. ( Beep ) ( Tape rewinds ) Green. ( Elevator bell dings ) Green. Green something. Green. Green. How'd you find me? Oh, hey. I'm a detective. Let's go before we miss all the fun! Come on. Where we goin'? Where we goin'? Hey, you all set up? Yeah, almost. Dennis is fixing the wire and Fran's working the floor. Cool. Hey, you ready? Give me the shot... I'm gonna need it inside. Okay? All right. Lucky broad. How's that? Got you to look after her. ( Knock on door ) Hey. Hey. Anything interesting? Yeah. Secretary's butt. ( Scoffs ) First thing I noticed. Later. Okay. Wren. Yeah? We're in position. You okay? Just upchucked my breakfast, but other than that, I'm fine. Right. Is the girl okay with the wire? No, "hello, Dennis"? No "how you doing today?" Oh, I'm sorry. Didn't realize you were the sensitive type. What do you want, a kiss on the cheek or something? Fuck yourself! ( Laughter ) ( Distant telephone rings ) ( Man answers telephone in Chinese ) ( Chuckling softly ) Rosie! Rosie! Yeah? Joey's heading your way. ( Speaking Chinese ) ( Joey chuckling ) Stash. Stash. ( Speaking sharply in Chinese ) Stash! Pick up the goddamn radio! ( Muffled shouting in Chinese ) Come on! ( Music playing softly ) Horak, you got a donut here with your name on it. ( Chuckles softly ) I don't know how you keep your girlish figures. ( All chuckling ) Stash, pick up the goddamn radio! Shit! ( Camera shutter clicks ) What? Give me the rover. What is it? Just give me the fuckin' radio. Rose, cna you hear me? Where the hell have you been? Shecky didn't turn on the radio. Tam's here. Yeah, well, the party's started without him, okay? What? Joey just beat the shit out of boa. ( Muffled cries and shouts ) ( Speaking Chinese ) ( Joey shouting in Chinese ) They made the girl, stash. Thirty seconds, Rose. Thirty seconds, and tam's an accessory. I gotta go in. No, wait. ( Pleading in Chinese ) ( Gunshots ) Police! Freeze! Let's go. Police! Get on the ground! Now! Everybody on the ground! Nooo! ( Gunfire ) Aahhh! Nooo! Get down! Police! Down! ( Indistinct shouting ) Freeze! Freeze! Freeze! Get down! Ouch. ( Chuckles ) The vest was a Christmas present from the hubby. Thoughtful. Ekberg. I'll see you. How bad is he? Thirty, forty stitches, and a headache. I talked to the d.A. We can't file against tam. What? There's no evidence to corroborate the assumption that tam sent Joey in to soften up boa. Tam could have been here buying chickens, for all we know. Oh, that's bullshit! If you'd have waited... if I'd waited, the girl would have been dead! Bottom line, Rose, tam's back on the street. ( Distant siren wails ) ( Sighs ) Detective? Thank you. ( Heavy sigh ) What a screw-up. I'm sorry, Rose. What a complete, tragic screw-up. I should have stood up for you. No matter what, I should have backed you. I don't know why I keep trying, you know? I really don't. Lately... ( Chuckles ) Especially since Carly left, I just feel like I'm in a dark room, you know? Like, uh, I'm crawling around and around and around looking for a light switch, right? Just thinking and hoping that someday I'm gonna find it and I'm gonna understand why I gave up so goddamn much for this lousy job! ( Sighs ) What's Ted's car doing here on a Saturday? I don't know. Oh, shit! Give me your keys. Hey, got the book, right? ( Cocking weapons ) ( Camera shutter clicks ) That's enough. The m.E.'S ready to bag her. Let's get some air. ( Indistinct radio chatter ) You and her close? We shared the same partner. You call Michelle? Yeah, she's freaked. Gonna take the kids to her mother's. Been doing this almost 17 years. Just when I thought there was nothing left to turn my stomach, shitheads prove me wrong. ( Siren approaches ) How do you see it? Better keep an eye on your partner. He's pretty messed up. Gordon, please. Figure he... waited till she got inside. What about Bob? Who? Other victim. Wrong place, wrong time, unless you know something I don't. How'd he get in? Front door. Well, it was locked when... When you fucked up any evidence that might have been on the knob. I thought the guy might have been inside. Catches her in the kitchen, she drops the bottle of booze. Did she fight? There was skin under her fingernails. She might have taken a whack at him. Then he drags her upstairs. Yeah? Why upstairs? She was raped? We'll see what the coroner says. Okay, so that means they'll be some semen, hair. That shit just helps build the case, Rose. It don't catch the puke who done it. What about prints? Doubtful. The guy didn't make many mistakes, Jimmy. That's it for me, guys. Find anything? Maybe. I don't know yet. What do you mean you don't know? I got a smudged palm and a partial index off her inner thigh. Enhanced some, it could be enough. I'll run it first thing tomorrow. Hey, Jimmy. Uh, I know it's late and you want to go home, but do you think there's any way possible that tonight you might... I'll do what I can. Yeah, thanks. Hey. Hey, what are you doing? What does it look like I'm doing? You know, um, Jimmy said he has a print and he's gonna... Let go of the door. Stash, go over to my place, all right? Stay in Carly's room, okay? Let go of the fucking door! Stash. ( Telephone rings ) Got a match? 'Cause it's you, I pulled in a favor. And? We'll know by morning. Shit! Jimmy! Come on, listen! A normal case, it'd be a week, at least. Hi, this is Julie. Stash and I aren't in right now. Please leave a message and I'll... Get some rest. And listen, Rose, lock your door. 'Night. Good night. ( Knocking ) ( Clock chimes softly ) ( Gasps ) I'm sorry, Rose. I'm sorry. Oh, god! Oh, stash... You scared the hell outta me! I'm sorry. I knocked. Oh, well, I didn't hear you. Um... Jeez, just give me, uh... Uh, my robe. Sure. Thank you. Thank you. Uh, no! The glass! Uh, yeah, I'll take care of it. When you didn't answer, I... I thought you'd gone to bed. I didn't mean to scare you. So, what'd you do? You picked my lock? I didn't want to wake you up. I, um... I didn't want to wake you up, but I didn't want to be alone. I, um... Went by my house. I couldn't make myself go inside. I couldn't... I couldn't make myself go inside my own house! ( Weeping ) It's all right. Ohh. I'm all right. You okay? Yeah. I'm all right. What happened to you? ( Chuckling ) I had a couple of drinks. At d-d's? Yeah. Yeah, I went there first, but it was like in the westerns where the bad guy walks into the bar and the piano player stops playing. Everybody knew, but... Nobody knew what to say, so they just stared at their feet. And I was embarrassed. My wife's dead, and i'm... embarrassed! It's okay. You know what I did afterwards? I found this place. I don't even know where it was, some dive someplace, out in nowhere. I ran into a couple of guys, and they gave me an excuse to... take it out on them. Oh, god. It's... Rose, do you think it'd be all right if I just... Held on to you tonight? I just need somebody to hold on to. Please. Yeah. Yeah. Let's go. You okay? Yeah. Okay. Let's just get you cleaned up. Get your jacket off, okay? Okay. That's it. Sweater. Aw, Jesus. Get you something to sleep in. ( Knock on door ) ( Quietly ) Shit! Well, well. You're up early. Somebody kick over the rock, wake you up? Ten o'clock early to you, Rose? Oh, you checkin' time cards? No, just wondering if you'd heard... Horak: Rose. ...from horak. Aw, shit. Jesus Christ! Let me ask you something, Ekberg. When you've got your legs sticking up in the air and the blood rushes to your head, does it dull your brain, make you feel better about yourself? What do you want? Thought you'd like to know... prints off the victim... Your wife... Got a make on the guy. Name's chou. Linh tse chou. What? Name ring a bell, Rose? Don't jerk my chain. You know he was an informant. Rose, where's my clothes? Washer. There's no hurry. Why, you know where he is? Yeah, I know exactly where he is. Barry, you want to come here? Man: Work from this spot down, right here. Start here... ( Indistinct ) How's horak? Great. What'd the coroner say? Caved-in forehead. Won't commit without cutting, but thinks the guy was dead before he hit the drink. He say what time? From what the catfish ate, best guess be around midnight. Rose. Yeah? Where did he stay last night? My place. When'd he get there? Oh, what difference does it make? Just askin'. Why are you so defensive? Just tell him what time! I don't know. Early, okay. That good enough for you? All right, I want to see tam first thing tomorrow. How you doing? It's a funny thing, Rose, how you can't stop the river from changing. If you try, you just get swept away. I wish I'd done this. I wish I'd felt his skull crash! Hey, it's okay. Hey, hey. Let's go home. I mean go back to my place. I-I'll be there soon... Okay? Okay, okay. Thanks. Shecky? Yeah. Do me a favor, will ya? Just give him a lift to my place. Thanks. Man: Anybody home? Stash? Dennis? Yeah. Got some cold cuts and stuff for after the funeral tomorrow. Horak here with you? Somebody had to do it. Um... you want a beer or something? Nah. Water's fine. I'm outta here. Oh. ( Indistinct noise ) ( Washing machine rattles ) ( Horak stirs ) Oh, hi. Hi. Uh, I didn't mean to wake you. Just need to take a bath. Guess I've been out for a while, huh? Yeah, I guess. What, uh, you and shecky, uh, tie one on? Yeah. Where have you been? Oh, your place. Why? Clean-up. ( Sighs ) To clean up. You know, over the years, I've seen so much blood, but I never once wondered... Who cleaned up. ( Washing machine stops ) Hey. Hey, it's okay. I never could have gotten through this without you. I don't think people understand how important it is to... Have somebody to count on. Somebody that you can hold on to. Where you goin'? Oh, just the office. You know, I got things to do. Rose. People make love for a lot of reasons, mostly the wrong ones. There's nothing wrong with what we did last night. Nothing. That damn thing is purposely set to spill half. Hey, Jimmy. Any more than that, it'd eat right through the bottom of the cup. Yeah, you know it. I was just about to come see you. Never too busy. Good. Um... When did the I.D. On the chou prints come in? Exactly, I mean. Why? Uh... curious. I'd have to check. Good. Thanks. Let me get back to you. Thanks. Hi. Hi. I didn't think you were gonna come in till after the funeral. I called mulvaney. He's bringing tam in for questioning. Oh. ( Chuckles ) Can you check my back and see if there's a sign on it that says I slept with my partner? ( Mouths silently ) Rose, you know mulvaney. Once he saw US, you had to know he wasn't going to keep it secret. I knew. Yeah, yeah. Listen, Rose, I'm sorry. It's not the way that i... I should have shot you when I had the chance! ( Tam speaks Chinese ) You got something to say, say it in English so everybody can get it, okay? Beware of judging others before judging your own, huh? Come on. Get outta here. ...and let perpetual light shine upon her. May our beloved Julie rest in peace. Mourners: Amen. May her soul and the souls of all the faithful departed through the mercy of god rest in peace. Amen. May the peace of god, which is beyond all understanding, keep your hearts and minds in the knowledge of god and of his son, our lord Jesus Christ. Mourners: Amen. May almighty god bless you: The father, and the son, and the holy spirit. Amen. Mourners: Amen. Captain. Excuse me. Can I talk to you for a minute? Yeah, sure. Um... I-I want to put in for a new partner. You're too late. I'm too late? Horak asked to be transferred this morning. What? Yeah. He said you'd become too close. ( Indistinct conversation ) Hi. Hey, Rose. Hey, Rose. Where's stash? Living room. Excuse me. Horak: 'Ppreciate it. Hey, how you doing? ( Indistinct comments ) Thank you. Hi, Rose. Can we talk? Yeah, but I've got to deal with all these people. This is just gonna take a second is all, okay? All right? Sure. Hold on. Over here. Excuse me. What? So... ahem... You asked for a new partner, huh? Yeah. Yeah. But you told kirkland that, uh, that I was getting too close to you. You know, like I couldn't wait for Julie to get cold before I had my hand in your pants. Jesus Christ, Rose! I thought that's what you wanted. I thought that's what was the best for both of US. Well, you thought wrong. Come on. Come on with me. ( Sighs ) Rose? Uh, not now, Jimmy, okay? I've got to tell you, I'm kind of worried about you. This is a really bad time. Really bad time, okay? That's my point. Look, everybody in there knows that you and horak are... Wait, listen to me. What with these murders and all... what are you saying?! Just say it! Just... Just do what I've been doing for years, all right? Watch your ass. Okay? Yep. ( Telephone ringing ) Couldn't this have waited? If I thought so, I wouldn't have brought you down here. I asked you at the river what time horak showed up at your place the night chou was killed. ( Telephone rings ) You said "early." I'd like you to be more specific. ( Telephone ringing ) It was... around eleven. Horak: Yeah? Mulvaney. That time did you say you got to Ekberg's apartment? Uh... it was three. Three A.M. Thanks. Captain, I don't know what this jerk is trying to get at. The truth, Rose, I'm just trying to get at the truth. If you can help US with that, Rose... Now is the time. Guess I made a mess of things, didn't I? ( Sighs ) You couldn't have known I lied for you. And you should have known you didn't have to. So why the hell did you tell kirkland I was getting too close to you? I told him I thought it was dangerous for you, that tam would go after anybody that was close to me. I don't know, he must have twisted my words to make it sound... Rose. Rose. Sit down. Oh, god. Listen. We've had to count on each other, when it meant living or dying. And that relationship... So special, so strong. It's so much more intimate than... Anything we could ever have in bed. You know, when the bad guys are coming at US. They've got their guns up and they're trying to kill US. I never doubted you, not for one second. Rose... Don't doubt me. Don't doubt me. Okay? Rose, you got a minute? I wouldn't bother you, but it's kind of important. Somebody wants to see you. She the one! What's this all about? She's the one! She let this man go! Her husband died, so... she opened up some. I'm sorry, Mrs. Thiu. I am very sorry about your husband. She's the one! Chou took a sap to the forehead, so whoever hit him knew him well enough to get an arm's length away. This had better not be leading where I think it is. Just doing my job, Rose... finding people who make other people dead. ( Busy signal ) ( Cocks pistol ) Please leave... Please leave... Please leave... Please leave... Please leave... ( Tape rewinds ) Please leave... ( Tape rewinds ) Please leave... ( Tape rewinds ) Please leave... ( Tape rewinds ) ( Lighter clicks ) Things have gotten kind of messy, haven't they, Rose? Please leave... If Rose says that's the way the house was when she got there, that's the way it was. Rose says a lot of things. Don't make 'em true. ( Horak sighs ) You know, I've had it about up to here with your... Horak! Don't start. Get the hell out. No, I won't! I'm tired of it! I said get the hell out. Rose, you're walking a tightrope here. I'd hate to see you take a fall. Take a fall? For what? How's conspiracy to commit sound to you? Oh, god. He still chewing on that old bone? Horak blew Joey tam away at four in the afternoon. So? So you found Julie horak at six-thirty. You think tam could get to chou and chou could do what he did to Julie horak in two hours and change? Maybe. How... how do I...? Look, the coroner's report says chou's head was fractured by a sap. Horak carry a Blackjack, does he? How 'bout you, Rose? You carry a sap? Uh, just what are you saying? Dead guys don't point fingers. Just what the hell's that supposed to mean? Oh, come on, Ekberg. Everybody knows horak's been dipping his stick into you. Maybe his wife didn't like sharing. Maybe there was one too many people in the sack. You goddamn cretin! You call yourself a detective! You couldn't find your dick in the dark! Rose, don't bother coming in tomorrow. Use the time to speak to a good attorney. Rose. Hey, Rose. Yeah, what is it, Jimmy? I got some good news for you. I could use a dose. I found out what you asked me, about when chou's print came in. It was six A.M. So that clears horak, right? He couldn't have killed chou. I mean, whoever cracked his noggin did it before any of US knew that chou murdered Julie. Hey, I thought you'd be pleased. Uh... I-I am. I am pleased. Thanks. Hey, Rose. What happened in there after I left? Mulvaney is... He's talking conspiracy. What? You and me, to kill chou. You know that's bullshit. Yeah, well, he's leaning hard. He's trying to put a wedge in between US. As long as we stay together... the old lady at the herb place saw me turn chou loose. Jesus, Rose. They don't think tam had time, stash, to set up Julie's hit. Now, they are looking at me for it, claiming that I'm jealous or something like that. That's crazy! It was tam, it had to have been tam. Did it? Did it, stash? Chou wasn't I.D.'D until six A.M., so if you did kill him, it wasn't for justice, it was for some... listen, Rose, let's go back to your place. Hey! Don't do that, all right? Rose. Rose. I won't do it for you. I won't go any further for you. Okay. ( Sighs ) ( Telephone rings ) Hello? Thank god. Jimmy? I would have called you sooner, but I just found out. Listen, Rose, there's not a lot of time. They found the weapon, the one that killed chou. Uh... what? It's a Blackjack, and they found it in your locker. It's impossible! Mulvaney's on his way, Rose, right now, to pick you up. Rose, are you still there? Not for long. I owe you, Jimmy. Just... think. ( Pounding at door ) Rose? Rose, I know you're in there. The superintendent saw you come home. I just want to talk to you. Rose, I don't want to have to kick in the door. Aw, shit. Gettin' too goddamn old for this shit! Rose! ( Radio playing ) ( Water running ) Jesus h. Christ. Goddamn it, Ekberg! For cryin' out...! ( Radio playing ) Gun, Rose? That wasn't your dick in your hand when you kicked in my door. Back up. Cuff yourself to the bed. This won't help, Rose. I didn't do it, Gordon. Never heard that before. Ekberg, don't do this. Let's just talk about it! Son of a bitch! ( Tires screeching ) ( Indistinct police radio chatter ) One more floor. One smile, and I'll kick your ass, I mean it! Oh, man! Ha ha ha! Gee, gordo, I didn't know you were into the kinky stuff! Didn't you see her running out of here? No, I didn't see anything. Oh boy oh boy. Hi, how you doin'? Look, I know the doctor's not in, but when I called, the nurse said she was just going to leave a file for me. The name's horak. Sorry. Nobody'll be here until after lunch. Uh-huh. Uh... all right, look, my insurance company is refusing to cover my husband's bill without an itemization. So, I mean, what would it hurt if you, you know, just... You save me another trip? ( Chuckles softly ) An itemization? Yeah, a list of the tests, so I can, you know, send it in for a reimbursement. ( Chuckles softly ) Well, uh, who's gonna know, right? Right. Horak? H-o-r-a-k? Right. Say, how 'bout you let me look at that whole file? You're probably not really the wife, am I right? Right. Sorry, honey. Shootin' blanks. When was Mr. Horak given these results? Four days ago. Hey! You can't take that! Who's gonna know, right? Man: Hey. Rose! This doesn't concern you! It's personal! It's my business! Rose! Rose! Rose! Rose! Why are you doing this? You're my partner. Aah! Aah! Aah! That is true. Sure, man. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I hear you, yammering all the time. ( Indistinct comments ) Check in, Dennis. You're on point, coming in here. Damn. Be well aware of each other. Stairs on the right. Right at the top is tam's office. Okay? Everybody understand? Okay. Get your gear. ( Indistinct comments ) ( Indistinct voices ) So, we send a land shark under the porch, right? The dog drags this guy out by the legs. What do you think the perp's got wrapped around his neck? You got me. An 8-foot boa constrictor. You're shitting me! Come on, now! Come on, help me get this up. Okay, so... Little while later, we're transporting the snake, right? I mean, it's evidence, right? The perp... the perp says, "you guys can't do that!" Why not? Hey says, "the snake's got gas!" Ha ha ha! So, what'd you do? ( Conversation continues, indistinctly ) ...and he says to me, he says to me just like this, "no fuckin' way, man!" So what happened? So, we transported the snake. ( Chuckling ) And? And... I had to burn my uniform, and they couldn't use the car for two fuckin' weeks! Oh, man, come on, man! That's a true story! Shut your mouth! ( Indistinct happy chatter ) All right. All right, get it. Let's go. Let's go! Just break it down. Let's go. Come on, move! Move! All right! Go, go, go, go, go, go! Listen, watch yourself! To the back! Go, go! All right! Police! Police! ( All shouting ) Stay down! Everybody get down! Come on, freeze! Gaaahhh! ( Gunshots ) ( Indistinct shouting ) I thought you might show up. I knew you would. Put your weapon on the floor. Put it on the floor, Rose. Shecky! We need the ram again! Move it! ( Shouting ) I admire you. Wanting to nail tam. ( Chuckles ) But under the circumstances... You know I'm not here for tam. No? ( Indistinct shouting ) I know what you did, stash. I know what you did to chou. I know what you did to Julie. Shit! Time to move! Let's go! If I'd been a better cop, I might have seen it a little sooner, in the way that Julie talked about her friend Ted and the way that you reacted to her pregnancy, or that story that you told me about getting the shit kicked out of you in 'nam. "Severe testicular trauma." Aah. ( Dumbwaiter rumbles ) You didn't bother to mention your inadequacy to your wife, though, did you? So when she got knocked up and said the kid was yours, you knew that she was lying, and that was when you hired our friend linh chou to find out who was screwing your wife, right? I really can see why you didn't like the pictures he took, huh? I mean, you know, what did he want? Did he want more money? Is that why you killed him? Huh? He showed these pictures to tam. He wanted US to bid on the negatives. Can you imagine? ( Indistinct shouting ) Basement... where is it? ( Speaking Chinese ) ( Responding in Chinese ) So you got a package deal, to sell you the negatives and kill your wife. Jesus Christ, that must have been expensive! It was expensive... For linh chou. ( Dumbwaiter rumbles ) You must have hated her. Hated her? I loved her! What an interesting turn of events. I want my negatives. You don't have them? So, chou conned you too. You were a fool, horak. Where are they? I paid, but you killed him before I could... where are they? I never found them! Where are the negatives? Where are they?! He's telling the truth. You. I thought I could count on you. I thought you loved me. But you're just like she was. You're not different at all. ( Gunshot ) Aah! ( Gunshots ) Rose! Rose! Rose! Rose! Rose! I want those negatives! Rose! Ahh! Ahh! Mulvaney: Talk to the janitor. Meet me where this comes out. Dennis: Right. Rose! ( Groaning ) Rose! ( Groaning ) Rose! Rose! Rose! You think you're tough? You're not tough! You're not tough at all! ( Heavy blow lands ) Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! Ohh! Put it down, Ekberg! Put it down! ( Gasping ) ( Mechanism clicks ) ( Gunshot ) Why didn't you call me earlier on? I don't like you, Ekberg, but I would have done the right thing. I mean, what the hell were you doing in that cellar, anyway? I was looking for that light switch. What are you talkin' about? Oh, my job, my life. You know what I realized when that bulb finally snapped on? What? All this time, I been crawling around an empty room. Oh, god. Come on, mulvaney, it's about time I made sure my kid ate her breakfast.
