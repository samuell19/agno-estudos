Ah, thank you, thank you. - To the band. - To the band. - To Ronnie's birthday. - Ronnie. - To Ronnie. - To Ronnie. Do you always celebrate the night before? I was born at 3 a.m. If I wait till tomorrow, by the time I wake up, it'll have been over. So keep drinking till 3:00 then? Can't. Things to do. I love you. I love you. What are you taking? Just a sleeping pill. Had a few rough nights lately. Why didn't you tell me? It doesn't matter. Hey. What's going on? We won't see each other when I go on tour. Babe, you're a rock chick. This is what you do. I can't follow you around the world, can I? And you're happy just to keep going like this? What? Forget it. I'm screwing up your birthday. No. I wanna know what you're talking about. You never stop. When you're working on your art, it takes you over. Like some kind of beast. What, so this is about me now? No. I'm the same. Exactly the same. But sometimes, it just gets to me, that we never have time to be together. Ronnie, your scar is bleeding. Wow. You really did a number on me. - Has it ever done that before? - No. I'd better get a plaster. Be back. Happy birthday, darling. Thank you, Mum. How was Lena's gig? Great. I'm still feeling it. I saw her video on YouTube in the store. Yeah? What did you think? Amazing. So when do I get to see you guys? We can do tonight if you like. Perfect. I made you a cake. Ooh, then we're definitely coming. Something happened to me last night. This whole huge painting just came to me out of nowhere. It only hit me afterwards that I started at 3 a.m. Exactly my birthday, right? Mm. Can I see it? Yeah, sure. Sorry. Do you have an IT section? Yes, sure, follow me. I'll be back, Mum. You sure she said tonight? Lights are on. Mum? Mum, it's me and Lena. Okay, thanks. Yeah, I hope so too. Can't register as missing yet. She has to be gone for 48 hours. Hi, this is Suleka. Leave a message, and I'll get back to you. Mum? Is that Ronnie? Yeah. You're Suleka's son, right? Yes. Who is this? I'm AJ, your cousin. Your Uncle Mohan's son. I'm calling from Kolkata. Ronnie, your mother's in hospital. She was hit by a car. What? In Kolkata? Well, we don't understand either. We didn't even know she was in India until the hospital phoned. Is she gonna be okay? Well, Ronnie, she's been kept in a coma. She has a blood clot on her lung. Uh, okay, okay, um... Look, I'm gonna search for flights right now, okay? Tell me when you're getting in, and I'll be there to get you. Okay. Thank you. Mum said she never wanted to go back to India. She said she never wanted to see those people again. Ronnie! Are you AJ? I recognized you from the photo on your Mum's phone. This way. First time here? Is my mother conscious yet? Mm-mm. No, no, no, no! They'll all come for you. Unintelligent behavior. I managed to transfer your mum to their special ward. Hi, Mum. It's me, Ronnie. Yes, sir. Shit. Are you the son from England? That's right. Ronnie. Dr. Multlar. Look, Ronnie, I've got some really good news for you. Early this morning, we managed to break down your mother's blood clot. So that means... That means we'll have to keep her in this state for another couple of days, and then we have hope that she'll recover. Look, this is the time when she needs to bathe her, and we also need to run some tests, so... Doctor... So there's Latta, AJ's wife, and their kid Juma. Juma's really sweet, actually. Really? How old is she? I think 5 or 6. And AJ's dad lives here. Mohan. Mum's older brother. Is he the one who treated your mum so badly? Yeah. He's barely said hello so far. I think dinner's ready. I'll call you later. I'm so glad to hear your mum's doing better. Please send her my love. It's a conch, you know? We blow it to ward off evil spirits. Why your mother doesn't do puja? She doesn't really keep up with those traditions. So when she's better, you think you will be exploring Kolkata with her? I expect she'll want to get back to London in a hurry. Depends if she's up to it. - This is delicious. - Thank you. This is ilish macher bhapa. Did you have it before? No. I don't think I've ever seen it on a restaurant menu. We mostly cook it at home. I don't think Ronnie's mother will cook something like this at home. Why are you so sure of that? 'Cause you said she isn't interested in Bengali traditions. Oh. Well, whose fault is that? Uncle Mohan? What do you mean? What do you think I mean? Making these digs at my mother, like she should be sorry for leaving India. She didn't abandon you. You abandoned her. What are you talking about? Please excuse us. Come. My mum married for love and apparently the man she loved was the wrong caste. So your dad here cut her dead. Even when my father died, and my mum was left pregnant and alone, your dad shut the door in her face. That's why she ran to London to have me. Ronnie, who told you that? My mum. Who do you think? What's this? This was taken on your parents' wedding day. That's my dad there. And this one is you... in your parents' Kolkata house. - Did you tell him I'm sorry? - Yeah. But this is what he's like when he's upset. He shuts everyone out. Hey, Ronnie, you smoke ganja? I can't understand why my mum made up all these lies. Maybe she lost it after my father died. Ronnie... Your dad was still alive when your mum left India. What? My dad said he would come around asking all the time if we had heard from her. But I was just a kid, man. I don't remember much. Wait. You're saying that my mum left my dad here? I think after about four or five years, he just stopped looking. I guess if he died, it would have been later. Meaning he might still be alive? You need to talk to your mum, man. Mum? Mum? Hey! It's me. I'm so glad you're okay. Where am I? You're in a hospital, Mum. But you're gonna be fine. You're in Kolkata. - Ronnie. - Yeah? You need to go. We'll leave as soon as you're better, Mum, okay? No. Go now. Why? She's coming. Who is? Ronnie? It's okay, Mum, it's okay. It's just a power cut. No, Ronnie, you need to go! You need to leave India. Go! Mum, I'm not gonna leave without you, okay? - Go! Go! Go! - Mum, Mum, I'm-- Excuse me, my mum's having some kind of fit. Can you please come and help? Excuse me, sir, I'm busy now, please. Nurse, I'm sorry to bother you, but my mum is having some kind of fit. Excuse me, that patient needs help. I'll come in a minute. Mum. Mum? Help me! One of the last things my mother said was that "she was coming." And you think she meant this woman in the purple sari? Well, she didn't kill your mother. She couldn't have made it to the ground level so fast. Probably she was some beggar woman passing by. What about the symbol she drew in my mother's blood? Who knows? Maybe she was just a crazy. You know, you can't really push someone from here. You have to pick them up and then throw them down. Thanks. Your mother was here because she ran in front of a car. My mother would never kill herself. I talk to her every day. She never said anything. I'm afraid they often don't. I'm sorry. What's this? It'll protect you. From what? They say it takes 13 days for your mother's soul to leave this place. And in that time, her soul is attracted towards her loved ones. Who's that? Excuse me, did you know my mother, Suleka? You are her son? I am very sorry. It was me. I did this. I hit your mother with my car. I called the hospital to know how she was doing, but they said she was... Do you think she ran in front of your car deliberately? It was like she was running away from someone. Where did this happen? Are we here? Okay. Do you remember this woman? Girlfriend? Accident. Run over last week. What the hell is this, huh? Where from, sweetie? London. Hey, hey, London! - No, sorry. - Drink, drink! - I'm sorry. - Yeah, come, sweetie, come. Good, thank you. Good morning. Excuse me. Have you seen this woman? She was here last-- Excuse me. Sorry. Have you-- Have you seen this woman? Did you see her? Accident. Car? Hey, mister, where you from? Where are you from, mister? You England? Yes. Alistair Cook, Steven Peterson, and David Beckham. Give me English money. Uh, I don't have any. Yes, English money in pocket, deep. Pocket, pocket. Mister! Mister! Wait, mister! Did you love your mother? Did you see her? Give me English money. I saw her three night ago. She was running away from the spirit house. The what? Spirit house. Ah. Um, my name is Ronnie. This is my mother Suleka. She died last night. No. I'm not here for this. My mother came here before she was run over. She was here, wasn't she? No. Now you go. My mother was hit by a car near here. Someone was chasing-- You recognize her, don't you? Why was she here? Your mother-- No! I didn't do anything! I didn't do anything! Get off of me! Get off of me! What the fuck? A place like that is bad news, man. You shouldn't be going there. Then why was my mother there? You know this for certain, huh? They recognized the photo, I'm sure of it. She's the last person in the world to believe in that crap. Ronnie, why can't you just let the police handle this? Then they'll think she was crazy enough to kill herself. Can I have one? What's going on? Durga Puja starts in a few days. Biggest festival in the city. This place gets insane, man. All these streets along here, all gonna be transformed. Wow. You really captured Mahishasura. Hey. So who is he? He's a Rakshasa. A demon king. May I? He wanted to bring apocalypse on Earth until Durgamma defeated him. You ever had a paan? What's a paan? "What's a paan?" I'll be right back. Hello? So you never saw this woman leave? She just led you to this young girl's body and then vanished? Yes. You say your cousin was with you on the street. Did he see this woman in the purple sari? No. He was buying... something. She's been dead for about three days now, sir. The killer tied her up, then cut her throat. Okay. Take her out, but keep her covered. There's a crowd out there. Okay. How long have you been in Kolkata? Three days. What are you implying? Right now, the only thing that links these two bodies is you. And the symbols, both painted with the victims' blood. Excuse me a second. Asha. Yes, sir. So the police called, wanting to confirm when you arrived in India. They can't accuse me of killing that girl. I wasn't even here. You don't understand how it works here. The police are under a lot of pressure to make arrests, especially with a young girl like this. Look, bhai, don't take this the wrong way, but you should go back to England before they come after you, yeah? If you need anything, call me. - Hello? - Hi, Ronnie. This is Asha, the police photographer. Can you meet me at Elgin House? At the murder scene. I knew they were the same. Last night. No. Do you know Bengali numbers? The one next to your mom's body was a six. That's a seven. I think the killer is numbering them. But they're in the wrong order. This girl was killed first. Nothing on her cousin? She said she was murdered in 1987. That's a long time ago. If he's killed before, police must have a file on him. Let's ask Banerji. No, I don't think we should involve him in this until we know something more, not when... you're still under investigation. Then why are you helping me? Because I know you didn't kill your mum. I have another idea. Thank you. Zero, zero, one... October 1987. Another ritual killing last night, - student Anadi Dapur. - That's her cousin. She is the sixth victim in as many days. A series of killings the police now say are definitely linked. Wait. It's here. It's a two. They said this was the sixth victim. Yep. Wait. The numbers are counting down. What are they counting down to? The seventh night, the seventh victim. But this one survived after a police officer heard her cries for help. He's saying he shot the attacker in the shoulder. He escaped through that window. So he might still be alive. It can't be the same killer. They shot him. And it was, what, 28 years ago. What? That's when my mother left India. Mum? Hello? Juma. Daddy's dead! Daddy's dead! What did you say? Juma, it's okay. Juma, it's all right. I just walked in. She just started screaming. Juma? - Daddy's dead! - You're dreaming. No, see? He's right here. Daddy's lying there. Daddy's dead. AJ. AJ. Is that a Bengali number? Yes, that's a three. What is it? You know the symbol... painted at the murders? This is it. How could Juma know that? Daddy! Coming, Juma. Ronnie. We need to talk. Our parents died on the same day. Did your mother tell you that? Father had a stroke, and my mother willed herself to go with him. And just like that, we were orphans. And, uh... we started attending séances. We? You mean my mother went too? She didn't want to go at first. I talked her into it. We were still teenagers. I was scared to go alone, so I made her come with me... to the Spirit House. The Spirit House? In Khalside? The medium in Khalside was a woman called Rakhee. - Very powerful. - Wait. - Why are you telling me this? - Please listen. Just listen to me. The legend was, as a child, Rakhee worked the bars in Nimdala... until one day, she was very badly burnt. From that moment, the spirits started speaking to her once they left the bodies My mum has never believed in any of this. After a while, I realized Rakhee was very bad news, so I stopped going to see her. But my mother didn't stop going. She became addicted to it. The séances. She couldn't stop. Rakhee had a great power over her. That's why I think Suleka went to Khalside this week. No. It doesn't make any sense. Why would my mother come all this way to find some crazy medium? Why now after so long? I have no idea, but I think it's a good idea that you're going away before anything happens to us. Did you tell the police about this Rakhee? Maybe they might wanna speak to her. No. Your mother is gone. What did this Rakhee look like? She always wore a purple sari. Why did mum lie to me about everything? I don't know. My birth, why she left India, my dad. I mean, fuck knows what's actually true about him. Look, Ronnie, don't worry about any of that now. Just come back, and we'll talk it all through. I just wish I just knew why she came back here. No. Hold on. There you go. Sorry about that. Lena. Lena? - Can I have the passport, sir? - Yeah. Uh, London. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Thank you, sir. Are you okay, sir? I'm fine. If you have a laptop, take it out of your bags and put it on the tray in front of you. All of your keys and wallets should be in the tray in front of you. Are you okay, sir? Sorry, excuse me. Fuck. My passport was in my bag, too, including my phone. Okay. Why don't you come into our office, and we can take a description of the man and then-- But my flight's closing. You're not getting onto that flight, sir. I'm sorry to ask you. My uncle doesn't want me at the house. You wait there. I'll be coming. Thank you, Asha. No problem. Oh. Your clothes are probably dry. One second. What happened? You passed out. I'm afraid you got sick on your clothes, so I rinsed them. Here. How are you feeling now? Better. Thank you. I'll let you get dressed. Sorry. This little girl sold me a bottle of water. It's like she had me marked out. It's a hard country for people like you. Anything can take you down. But a man stole my bag, passport, everything. I was puking up, and he was there waiting. I sound completely paranoid, right? No. Not completely. Did you give Detective Banerji the newsreels? I did. But he has a dozen open murder cases. He's not about to take up a case from 30 years ago. But if it's coming from you-- Especially if it's coming from me. Were you and Detective Banerji ever in a relationship? I saw a photo. I'm afraid we still are. He's my father. I don't usually tell people. I was a screw-up when he got me the job. And where is your mum? My mum's not alive. Ronnie, are you still looking for answers? What do you mean? I found the original police file. The police did have a suspect back then. Arun Das. Arun Das. Arun Das. Ronnie, maybe we should leave this. No. He was a priest? In training. After they shot him, Arun Das was never seen again. So... How old was he when they shot him? He was, uh... 28 then. The worst thing is that all the victims were people he should have cared about. I don't understand. Like relatives, loved ones. The last victim who ended up brain damaged was... Arun's mother. - Does it say where he lived? - In one of the slums. - Which slum? - Um... Khalside. The rumor is he used to spend nights there with a medium called, um... Rakhee. This is where your mum was knocked over? Why do you think she came here? I don't know. But it has to do with Rakhee. - You know where you're going? - Yeah, it's this way. - She sold me the water. - What? At the airport. Ronnie! Wait! Wait! Wait! Stop! Hello? Hello? Ah, Ronnie, what happened? Some... Someone... This is the place. She's saying your mother came in with this knife. Who was my mother looking for? Rakhee. Nah. Where is Rakhee now? Is she alive? Arun Das. Arun Das. This is where the cop said he shot him. Bullet hole. Look. This really could be Arun Das. Arun Das. Arun Das. Hey. Hello? Ronnie. My father caught the Elgin House killer. They're at the station. How did you know this was there? I don't know. What does it say? "Send seven souls to hell in seven nights in place of my soul, so I can return forever, Rakshasa." A Rakshasa is a demon king. Yes. This demon. Kali Yuga's coming. My mother knew all about this stuff. It took ahold of her. What does it mean? There's a prophecy in the Vedas. Kali Yuga. A time when demons walk the Earth again. Families kill each other. Apocalypse. If that's the ritual, he failed. Arun didn't kill seven. Twenty-eight years ago. So who's your father arrested? Please. Family of the dead girl. Come in. Sit down. But he's just a boy. You're not allowed in here! I signed him in. Did this kid really kill my mother? No. He just killed the girl, Shugan Nagush. He has an alibi for your mother's death. It checks out. But he painted the same symbol over the girl's bed. Even if he painted it, it's irrelevant. He was in a study group when your mother died. Twenty people saw him. Then who drew it? After your mother's death, you ran down to her body, right? This is bullshit. Papa, please. You need to look at this file. There was a series of murders just like this in 1987. The same symbol was used. You are investigating my case with the suspect? Read this file. All of this is connected to the present-day murders. Have you gone completely crazy? You need to listen to us or five more people may die. Enough! Shugan Nagush's family needs a car home. Go. Call for one. Your mother's valuables. You can collect the clothes from the front desk. What does this mean? Aren't you investigating it anymore? We recovered the CCTV footage from the hospital. Nobody went in or out of the ward. I wanna watch that footage. Listen. The only person who could have killed your mother is you. Now, I don't think I can prove that, but if you like, I can give it a damn good try. Asha, it's me, Ronnie. I need to talk to you. I need your help with something. I wanna talk to the family of the girl that was murdered. The case has been closed, Ronnie. He's not the real killer. My father suspended me from duty. It's over. But that's not what you believe, is it? I don't know what I believe in anymore. That kid didn't do this. Your dad knows it. He just needed to make an arrest. Why are you still doing this? Maybe my father was right. You should just go back home for your own good. I can't. If I just leave this, how do I know it won't follow me back to England? The victims were all close to the killer 28 years ago Maybe my Mum is somehow connected to this girl's family? Write it down. You have a pen? Yeah. It's Golback Road. 45A Karun Apartments. The girl's father's name is Roger Degosh. Roger? What is it? I'm very sorry to disturb you. May I talk to you about your daughter Sekonia? Why? Who are you? My mother was killed. I think the same person may be responsible. I'm sorry. Okay, come in. Hashminda! Come in 10 minutes. Come. Can I offer you a cup of tea, uh... Mr. Degosh, may I show you a picture of my mother? Ronnie? She told me you were dead. We keep on being told that the power cuts will stop, but they really have been getting worse. Why did Mum leave India? What did she tell you? The story I know now is completely untrue. I didn't even know I was born here until five days ago, when Uncle Mohan told me. What really happened? As soon as you were born, you got very sick. The doctors were certain that you wouldn't last the week. What was wrong with me? It was your heart. After four days, the doctors told us that they were going to try a last ditch operation, but... we must prepare for the worst. But I got better. I survived. The scar on my chest is from the operation. Your mother used to go to séances. Did Mohan tell you that? Without telling me, she took you from your hospital bed before they could operate. Where did she take me? I found her back at our flat just before dawn, packing a suitcase, and you were lying in a basket by her bed. You had a fresh scar all the way down your chest. But you seemed... you seemed better. She took me to Rakhee, didn't she? You know about her. Your mother told me that Rakhee had cured you and that we had to leave India right this moment. Go far away. I couldn't accept it. I told her I didn't believe in witchcraft. I refused to leave. But when I woke up the next morning, you were both gone. What did Rakhee do to me? I don't know. Tell me what my mum said. Tell me! All she said was that Rakhee had brought you back to us from the other side. Hashminda? Arun's victims were all close to him. This time they're all close to me. My mum, my half-sister. AJ's kid had that dream that he'd be killed. Seven souls in seven nights, remember? That's what the scroll said. It's gonna be okay. What? Your half-sister was killed six days ago. This week ends in... four hours. Fuck. Ronnie. It's gonna be okay, okay? It's gonna be... Stop! Oh! What the fuck was that? I'm sorry. What happened? I don't know. Ronnie... Asha, it's me. Thank you. Excuse me, do you recognize any of these buildings? I want you to find this building. This one here. Please wait for me, okay? I will triple what's on your meter, yeah? You killed them all. I don't speak Bengali. I can only understand-- Where did you hide it? What? What foreign girl? No. No! No! Oh, Jesus, you're here. AJ, it's me, Ronnie! Ronnie. Thank God, yeah. Where have you been? I got people looking for you all over Kolkata. Come, come, come, come. I was really starting to freak out when you didn't come home before sundown. Hey, you want a drink or what? - Where is she? - Who? - Lena. - Who's Lena? My girlfriend Lena from the UK. She's here. No, man, there's no one here. Is she coming in tonight? No. Maybe. Let me get you a cup of tea. I just made some. You look beat, bro. Sure. Give me Lena's flight details, and I'll go get her myself. You remember how chaotic the airport is. Lena! Lena. Ronnie? Thank God, man. Where have you been? What's the matter, bro? It's very easy to get lost at the airport. What are you doing, man? - AJ, AJ... - What? Where's Lena? AJ, AJ! Lena? Lena! Daddy's dead! He's lying in the kitchen! Lena! Is that a Bengali number? Yes, it's a three. - You're dreaming. - Lena! Lena? Lena? Lena? Lena. Oh, my God. Stay with me. Okay, Lena, get your arm around me. You can do this. Come on. One, two, three, go. Come on, stay with me. Stay with me. Help! Help! Please help me! Just hold onto my hand, okay? Just hold onto my hand. Yeah, good. You're doing great. Wait. What's he injecting into me? She is losing pressure. He's just doing his job, okay? You're gonna be fine, babe. I need to talk to you. Remember me... me talking to you in bed after the gig? Yeah. You said that you weren't sure about touring and that, um... and that you wanted us to spend more time together. - Need to tell you something. - What is it? I'm pregnant. Lena! Lena! Lena! Lena! Oh, my God. No, no, no, no, no. No. No! No! Kali Yuga's coming. A time when demons walk the Earth again. Families kill each other. Apocalypse. No. I'm not gonna let you win. No! No! No! Stop it! No, please!
